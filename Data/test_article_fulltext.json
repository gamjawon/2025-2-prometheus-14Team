Graphical abstract The simultaneous engineering of sulfur cathode and Li anode is critical for electrolyte-starved high-energy–density Li-S batteries. Herein, we challenge the conventional wisdom of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalyses in Li-S batteries, the concept of anti-heterogeneous catalysis is proposed to synchronously realize effective LiPS trapping/conversion and protection of Li anode through employing a small amount of non-nucleophilic electrolyte additive of an amidomagnesium halide, hexamethyldisilazide magnesium chloride (HMC). Regulated by the amidomagnesium halide chemistry, over 1000 h of cycling is realized in Li/Li symmetric cells, revealing superb compatibility of the HMC-incorporated electrolyte with lithium metal. Meanwhile, via elevating the dissociation free-energy barrier of Li+ in LiPS, the liquid HMC catalysts significantly decrease the solubility of lithium ploysulfides and promote the multistep conversion of sulfur electrochemistry, which enable a quasi-solid-state reaction and minimal shuttle effect. Practically, a high energy density of 423 Wh kg−1 with decent cycling stability is achieved in electrolyte-starved pouch cells. Keywords Anti-heterogeneous catalysis Li compatibility Polysulfide solubility Amidomagnesium halide Lithium-sulfur batteries 1 Introduction In the pursuit of effective, sustainable, and economical energy future, energy storage systems with higher energy density and lower cost are highly required. Lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been widely investigated as fascinating next-generation energy storage systems, owing to the high theoretical specific capacity and low cost of sulfur.[1–4] However, the practical application of Li-S batteries is retarded by the the low electrical conductivity of solid sulfur species, notorious shuttle effect and the sluggish multi-phase conversion kinetics of sulfur-related species, which result in the low sulfur utilization, low Coulombic efficiency (CE), and gradual accumulation of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) in electrolyte, inevitably giving rise to a short lifespan of Li-S batteries.[5–7] Worse still, owing to the exposed fresh Li in LiPS electrolyte or the penetration of LiPS through solid electrolyte interface (SEI), the parasitically side reactions between LiPS and highly reactive Li metal incur serious corrosion on Li anode and even the formation of hazardous Li dendrite, which are deemed as the critical factors for the cells dry-out and failure with high mass loading and lean electrolyte.[8–11] In the race to develop practically viable Li-S batteries with high energy density, hybrid S/C cathode is strongly considered owing to its facile scale-up.[12,13] However, the nonpolar (or low-polar) nature of most carbonaceous materials makes carbon-based materials ineffective in trapping polar LiPS. In recent few years, catalysis has been introduced into Li-S batteries, which attracts intensive interests mainly due to the accelerated conversion of soluble LiPS, posing an initiative strategy to tackle the shuttle effect.[14,15] Thereinto, heterogeneous catalysts (Fig. 1 a), including metal sulfides, carbides, phosphides, nitrides, have been demonstrated to facilitate sulfur electrochemistry in organic electrolytes. Nevertheless, the catalysis process for LiPS only proceeds on the surface of solid anchoring materials, which critically decelerates the catalytic efficiency of LiPS. Homogeneous catalysis[16] (Fig. 1b), an alternative strategy to trap soluble LiPS in electrolytes and expedite the conversion of LiPS at the homogenous interfaces, exhibits great potential in boosting development of Li-S batteries through adding liquid mediator to regulate the precipitation-dissolution chemistry. Unfortunately, the homogenous catalysis system is still plagued by the uncontrolled Li dendrite growth and poor reversibility in flooded electrolyte environment, thus failing to reach the strict evaluation criteria of lean electrolyte usage towards high-energy–density batteries. Therefore, the establishment of an all-purpose catalysis tactics that can effectively serve both in the sulfur cathode and Li metal is highly desirable to achieve durable sulfur electrochemistry under lean electrolyte operation. Herein, we challenge the conventional wisdom of heterogeneous/homogeneous catalyses and propose an “anti-heterogeneous catalysis” strategy (Fig. 1c) to synchronously realize effective LiPS trapping/conversion and construct reliable Li anode simply via incorporating a small amount of non-nucleophilic electrolyte additive, hexamethyldisilazide magnesium chloride (HMDSMgCl, abbreviated as HMC for simplicity).[16] With the manipulation of amidomagnesium halide chemistry, the solubility of long-chain LiPS is dramatically reduced, which dictates a quasi-solid-state conversion mechanism and minimal polysulfide shuttling during cell operation (Fig. 1d). Using a potent combination of theoretical simulations and in situ/ex situ spectroscopic analyses, an effective electrocatalytic behavior of HMC on sulfur electrochemistry is confirmed. The anti-heterogeneous catalysis, which is featured by the liquid catalyst (HMC) and quasi-solid catalysants (sulfur species), results in substantially accelerated redox reaction. Moreover, the non-nucleophilic HMC reversibly participates in Li anode reaction, which is beneficial for the stable Li stripping and plating. As a result, the presence of only 0.25 vol% liquid catalyst enables electrolyte-starved pouch cells to deliver a high energy density of 423 Wh kg−1, showcasing great potential in promoting the practical application of Li-S batteries. 2 Results 2.1 Compatibility of HMC in Li anode As a Grignard reagent derivant, the HMC is utilized owing to its non-nucleophilic and sulfur-compatible features that are different from most of the nucleophilic organomagnesium compounds.[16,17] We first investigated the compatibility of HMC in Li anode during cycling via implementing the Li plating/stripping tests in Li/Cu and symmetrical Li/Li cells. As depicted in Fig. 2 a-c, Li/Cu cells with HMC additive exhibit remarkably enhanced cycling stability and alleviated overpotentials at a current density of 0.32 mA cm−2, with a stable CE of 98.5% even after 350 cycles (Figure S1), indicative of high reversibility and restricted side reactions between the Li metal and electrolyte, which would be beneficial in suppressing the formation of “dead lithium” and lithium dendrite.[10,18–20] Li metals after 350 cycles were harvested for scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation. The deposited Li surface in HMC-free electrolyte displays affluent crevice and dendritic growth, in which rod-like crystals with high aspect ratios generate thick and highly fluffy Li deposition (Fig. 2d and Figure S2a, b). This morphology evolution is stemmed from the side reactions between Li metal and electrolyte, as evidenced by a low CE and poor cycling stability (Fig. 2a). In sharp contrast, the Li metal in HMC-incorporated electrolyte maintains a smooth and closely-packed surface with rich coverage of round-edged Li deposition (Fig. 2e and Figure S2c, d), revealing that the dendritic Li electrodeposit is largely meliorated. The thickness of the cycled Li metal is only 81 µm (vs. 510 µm in the HMC-free electrolyte) after 350 cycles, which confers the higher safety, higher CE, and higher volumetric capacity. It should be mentioned that it is thermodynamically likely for Mg deposition to appear on Li anode in the dual-ion electrolyte since the standard reduction potential of Li (∼3.04 V vs NHE) is lower than that of Mg (∼2.36 V vs NHE).[21] As expected, slight metallic Mg and Li-Mg alloy are detected in the surface of Li metal (Figure S3, S4), demonstrating the reversible deposition of Mg has exerted favorable impacts on the Li plating/stripping, which is further evidenced by the Li-Li symmetrical cells.[22–24] As can be seen in Fig. 2f, the cells with HMC additive display a much lower and extremely steady polarization voltage of only 6 mV over 1000 h, consolidating a stable and homogeneous Li stripping/plating process. Likewise, the surface of Li anode exhibits a homogeneous deposition morphology without obvious lithium dendrite after adding HMC (Fig. 2g). With the absence of HMC, porous structures and cracking overwhelm the Li-metal surface (Fig. 2h), accompanied by high porosity. Besides, valley-like cracking is clearly discernible from the cross-sectional profile of Li anode in HMC-free electrolyte (Fig. 2i), while the cells with HMC is almost capable of maintaining its original morphology (Fig. 2j), reconfirming the pronounced compatibility with Li-metal anode simply via incorporating suitable HMC into conventional dioxolane/dimethoxyethane (DOL/DME) electrolyte.[19,24,25] 2.2 Amidomagnesium halide chemistry at cathode interphases The physicochemical property of HMC-incorporated polysulfide electrolyte was further investigated. As shown in Fig. 3 a and Figure S5, after the addition of 0.25 vol% HMC, the dark brown Li2S4 solution gradually turns into green-yellow after 30 min. Conspicuously, further increase of the HMC concentration to 0.5 vol% generates abundant yellowish-white sediments. In light of the non-nucleophilicity and low concentration of HMC additive, it is unlikely that the observed color variation and significant liquid–solid separation of Li2S4 solution (which are indicative of the formation, dissolution, and diffusion of mixed long-chain polysulfides) result from the chemical reactions between the HMC and Li2S4 solution. Meanwhile, the oxidizing ability of Li2S4 species is even weaker than that of sulfur, which also signifies the chemical reaction between HMC and Li2S4 is highly impossible. We hence speculate here that the addition of HMC has altered the solubility of Li2S4 solution, which is evidenced by the UV–vis spectra. As depicted in Fig. 3b, the pristine Li2S4 solution presents three absorption bands at 325, 475, and 617 nm, which can be assigned to S4 2-, S6 2-, and S3 ●- species.[22,25] Interestingly, after incorporating 0.25 vol% of HMC in the Li2S4 solution, the UV–vis spectrum shows a visible increase in S2- species while an obvious decrease in S4 2-, S6 2-, and S3 ●-species, implying that the solubility of Li2S4 solution is largely decreased. When examined closely, the absorption bands of S2-, S4 2-, S6 2-, and S3 ●- almost vanish after adding 0.5 vol% HMC, replaced by the dominant existence of HMC additive at 220 nm, as witnessed by the black and jacinth curves in Fig. 3b. In addition, the persistent existence of HMC additive with various concentrations consolidates that the generation of solid sediments is from physical precipitation from the pristine Li2S4 solution rather than chemical reaction between HMC and LiPS solution. Meanwhile, the measured solubility of polysulfides is only 30 mMS, which signifies the re-precipitation of solid precursors in the stoichiometric Li2S4 solution (viz. recipe of 3 mol S + 1 mol Li2S). This is forcefully proved by the detection of Li2S and S phases in the solid sediments and the cycled HCG-S cathodes (Fig. 3c and Figure S6). These observations may be explained by the fact that stoichiometric Li2S4 solution undergoes rearrangement after adding the HMC, which leads to the disintegration of Li2S4 molecules and concurrent generation of solid Li2S/S, as well as the adduct of green-yellow Li2S2 (subgraph II in Fig. 2a). To elucidate the mechanism that pertains to this prominent solubility change, classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted in the similar electrolyte system.[26–28] Intensified molecule aggregations of LiPS (Li2S8, Li2S6, Li2S4) are observed along with increasing HMC concentration from 0.1 to 0.25 vol%, suggesting a reduced LiPS solubility (Fig. 3d-f and Figure S7-9). The agglomeration of LiPS clusters is observed as the HMC concentration further increases, which is responsible for the observed liquid–solid separation of Li2S4 solution (Fig. 3a). As demonstrated previously,[16,17] the HMDS2Mg and MgCl2 moieties uniformly co-exist in the HMDSMgCl solution via the Schlenke equilibrium in amidomagnesium halide chemistry (Eq. (1)), which is also responsible for the detection of Mg species on Li surface in Li-Li symmetrical cells (Figure S3, S4). The high polarity of the magnesium nitrogen bond derived from the delocalized electron pairs on Si-N-Si unity of HMDSMgCl/HMDS2Mg is able to induce amidomagnesium-Li bonding (Eq. (2) and Eq. (3)), as evidenced by the visible attenuated charge density distribution (marked by pink loop) of LiPS after adding HMC (Fig. 3d-f and Figure S7-9), thus bridging the LiPS into a well defined domain that divulges a strong tendency of phase separation of LiPS in the electrolyte. This is to some extent supported by the perceptible concentration decrease of HMC observed in UV–vis spectra (Fig. 3b). Correspondingly, the enhanced coordinations between the HMC and LiPS molecules decrease the solvation of LiPS in DOL/DME solvent (see the red, blue and pink loops in Figure S7-9), resulting in a uniform distribution of aggregated clusters (dull yellow domain in Fig. 3d-f). Excessive addition of HMC breaks the Schlenke equilibrium and leads to an inhomogenous dispersion of amidomagnesium-Li bonding, which results in a severe agglomeration phenomenon (Figure S7c, 8c, 9c). Besides, the strong binding interactions between HMC and DOL/DME, revealed by the rich charge density distribution of HMC (see red loop in Fig. 3d-f and Figure S8-10) in the proximity of LiPS clusters, indicative the solvent activity, or the solvation capability, is remarkably inhibited, which is also amenable to the reduced LiPS solubility in the presence of HMC. (1) 2HMDSMgCl ↔ HMDS 2 Mg + MgCl 2 Schlenke equilibrium (2) Li 2 S x ↔ Li + - LiS x - (3) HMDS 2 Mg + Li + ↔ HMDS 2 Mg - Li The decreased solubility is further validated from the perspective of dissociation free-energy barrier (DFEB) of Li+ in LiPS solution with HMC. As for DOL/DME-based LiPS systems (Figure S10), the Li+ dissociation in the Li2S8 system is energetically favorable than that in both the Li2S4 and Li2S6 systems mainly due to the closer proximity of Li+, S, O-coordination space minimum for joint S/O coordination (related to DOL/DME pair) compared to that of Li2S4 and Li2S6.[26] With the incorporation of HMC, the Li+ dissociation barriers for these LiPS species are remarkably increased (Fig. 2g-i), meaning a distinct molecular clustering behavior. This can be interpreted as follows: in the DOL/DME-based LiPS system, the intercluster/interchain Li+ exchange occurs through the dynamics of -(S-S)-n chain/-(S-S)-n chain cluster aggregation and dissolution that otherwise substantially shuttle Li+ from one chain/cluster to another. When the HMC is added, the joint Li+ coordination by the DOL/DME solvent and HMC molecules (amidomagnesium-Li bonding) weaken the intercluster Li+ exchange, which drives the electrolyte system into a desolvated regime where DOL/DME solvent is subject to weak interactions with LiPS, thus resulting in remarkably suppressed DOL/DME solvent activity toward LiPS (viz. small solubility of LiPS).[26–27] Particularly, the DFEB of a single Li+ into the solvent from the minimum at (1.88, 1.76) to the minimum at (0.95, 2.34) is 0.48 eV, and the corresponding free energy of reaction is calculated to be 83.3 Kcal mol−1 for the Li2S4 system, which is visibly lower than that of Li2S6 (105.0 Kcal mol−1) and Li2S8 (124.0 Kcal mol−1) systems (Fig. 3g-i). This implies that the evolution from Li2S8 to Li2S6 and Li2S4 is dynamically favorable in the presence of HMC, which is helpful for the sulfur electrochemistry involving multistep conversion and speciation (vide infra). 2.3 Electrochemical performance of Li-S cells The much reduced LiPS solubility indicates a proactive solution to diminish the accumulation and arbitrary diffusion of LiPS in electrolyte. However, it is worth pointing out that, direct lithiation of sulfur into insoluble Li2S2 and Li2S via a solid–solid or quasi-solid–solid route is kinetically sluggish due to the insulating nature of these solid compounds.[1,20,29] The solubilized LiPS species can still act as redox mediators to the insoluble and insulating end members, despite the interwoven problems of LiPS dissolution. Therefore, the effects on multistep conversion processes during discharge/charge for the incorporation of HMC additive are studied. Fig. 4 a shows the CV curve of Li2S6-based symmetrical cells. It can be found that the electrodes deliver an enhanced current density with perceivable redox peaks after the incorporation of HMC additive, despitethe dilute Li2S6 concentration in the electrolyte (derived from the reduced solubility), incarnating the remarkably accelerated electrochemical conversion efficiency between the high-order LiPS species.[30] Theoretically, the great aggregation of high-order LiPS species is inclined to allow the polysulfides to reareach a dynamic equilibrium and form Li2S4-enriched domain, which is beneficial for the subsequent conversion to Li2S. As witnessed in Fig. 4b, the cells with HMC show a significantly improved capacity of 184.9 mAh g−1 (according to Faraday’s law) for Li2S formation, which is much higher than that of HMC-free cells (53.5 mAh g−1), revealing the ostensive catalytic effects on sulfur electrochemistry. The anti-heterogeneous catalysis-induced interface-propelled redox behavior is also reflected by the augmented exchange current density observed in Tafel plots (Figure S11).[31] Unlike the conventional homogenous and heterogeneous catalysis scenarios,[15,31] this anti-heterogeneous catalysis, characterized by liquid catalyst and quasi-solid catalysants (viz. a reversed active and passive relation of heterogeneous catalysis) not only inhibits the dissolution of high-order LiPS species, but also guarantees rich and homogeneous catalytic interfaces, which alter the conventional multiphase conversion from solid-liquid-solid to quasi-solid-state reaction, while maintaining a high transition rate. The anti-heterogeneous catalysis endowed by the HMC additive was further evaluated in Li-S batteries. As a typical non-polar carbonaceous material, highly conductive graphene (HCG) was utilized in our study to eliminate the interface-propelled effects from sulfur host in the hybrid sulfur cathode. More details about HCG-S composites are discussed in Supporting Information (Figure S12-14). The amount of HMC additive in electrolyte was optimized according to the electrochemical performance shown in Figures S15 and only 0.25 vol% HMC is enough to satiate the performance improvement, which is in good agreement with the discussions mentioned above (Fig. 3d-i). Figure S16 shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves in the voltage range of 1.5–2.8 V.[31] Typical lithiation/delithiation processes of Li-S batteries are observed, which is quite different from the reported solid-state conversion process using sparingly solvating electrolyte.[32] This observation means that the anti-heterogeneous catalysis system still follows the multiphase conversion mode of sulfur chemistry. Clearly, the incorporation of HMC catalyst substantially relieves polarization by raising cathodic peak and reducing anodic peak by approximately 0.15 V. Consistent with CV results, the overpotential in galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurement for the cells with HMC is lower than that of the control sample (Figures S17a, b). The corresponding reaction resistances of cells with HMC continuously maintain at a low level during lithiation/delithiation processes (Figure S17c), hinting that the HMC can effectively reduce the polarization. This is also reflected by the higher active material utilization efficacy at various current rates (Fig. 4c) and lower charge transport resistances (Figure S19). The superiority of anti-heterogeneous catalysis system also promises prominent cycling stability. As presented in Fig. 4d, with the HMC additive, the initial capacity is efficiently enhanced from 917 to 1395 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C. A higher capacity of 814 mAh g−1 is remained in the presence of HMC additive than the control sample of only 279 mAh g−1 after 150 cycles. Moreover, when the areal sulfur loading is sharply increased to 4.8 mg cm−2, the cells with HMC are still able to deliver a high areal capacity of 3 mAh cm−2 over 70 cycles, although visible capacity attenuation is observable during the initial 20 cycles owing to the open access of two dimentional HCG host. While the cells with standard electrolyte almost stagnate after 70 cycles. To validate the superiority of anti-heterogeneous catalysis system in more practical Li-S batteries, electrolyte-starved pouch cells with HMC additive were evaluated with a sulfur loading of 4.4 mg cm−2 and electrolyte-to-sulfur mass ratio of 2.8 μL mg−1. As shown in Fig. 4f, the pouch cells realize a high initial cell-level energy density of 423 Wh kg−1 (corresponding to ca. 1261 mAh g−1) (Figure S18), as well as a high average CE of ∼ 98% and decent cycling stability up to 30 cycles, offering a promising route toward practical high-energy–density Li-S batteries. In light of the fact that the HCG herein employed is a non-polar carbonaceous material with intrinsic low adsorbability to LiPS, we deem that there should be many efforts to optimize the structure and property of sulfur host for further enhancement in electrochemical performance in this anti-heterogeneous system, including heteroatom doping, engineering of microstructure, and hybridization with polar anchoring materials. 2.4 Mechanism analysis in Discharge/Charge process To better understand the appealing superiorities of the anti-heterogeneous catalysis in Li-S batteries, in situ UV–vis spectroscopy was performed by analyzing the speciation occurred in electrolyte during cell operation. Without adding HMC additive, distinct Li2S4 and Li2S6 species are detected at the beginning of discharge (Fig. 5 a), indicating the severe dissolution of high-order LiPS in this HMC-free cells. As the discharge precedes, the intensity of Li2S4 is gradually boosted, meaning the continuous LiPS accumulation in electrolyte. Moreover, high concentration of Li2S4 still exists in electrolyte at the end of discharge, indicative of inefficient conversion from Li2S4 to solid Li2S. Similar sluggish electrochemical behavior is also observed during the subsequent charge process (Fig. 5a). This is highlighted by the coexistence of rich S8 and Li2S phases detected in XRD patterns (Fig. 5b). Additionally, owing to the side reaction between Li and LiPS, severe Li metal corrosion can be visualized (Figure S20). By contrast, the intensity of LiPS species in the cells with HMC is much lower than that of HMC-free cells during the entire charge/discharge processes (Fig. 5c), manifesting the noticeably suppressed LiPS dissolution in electrolyte.[20] Moreover, negligible Li2S4 can be detected at the end of discharge, unambiguously demonstrating the complete conversion from Li2S4 to Li2S, which is further consolidated by the almost alternant emergence and disappearance of S8 and Li2S phases (Fig. 5d). These results also convincingly explains well why the high active material utilization is achieved (Fig. 4c and d). Interestingly, an earlier emergence of Li2S4 is visualized at the initial stage of discharge in the presence of HMC additive, despite the significantly reduced concentration of Li2S4 during all the charge/discharge processes. Meanwhile, the Li2S4 is also quickly detected when the cell is reversed to charge process. These observations incisively illuminate the catalytic effects of HMC additive on sulfur electrochemistry. Our postmorterm morphological characterizations also show a smooth Li anode surface with sparse sulfur and uniform Mg distribution (Figure S21), confirming again that the anti-heterogeneous catalysis system is energetically propitious to retard the permeation of LiPS through SEI and the propagation of the Li dendrite. According to the amidomagnesium halide chemistry, the Si-N-Si unity in HMC should be able to delocalize the electron pairs on the nitrogen, which induces higher polarity of magnesium nitrogen bond. Upon contacting with LiPS, the uniformly dispersed HDMSMgCl/HMDS2Mg species (Schlenke equilibrium) induce rich amidomagnesium-Li bonding, which is conducive to a rapid LiPS clustering. The largely improved DFEB of Li+ after adding HMC into DOL/DME, as proved by the theoretical calculations in Fig. 3g-i, leads to the weakening of the intercluster Li+ exchange since Li+-S bonding is stronger than both the Li+-O (DME) and Li+-O (DOL) bondings.[27] Compared with the strong Li+-S bonding,[20] the weaker S-S bonding in the chains of LiPS is subject to weakening owing to the electron-deficient metal Mg center in HMC, albeit with the non-nucleophilicity, which contributes to the scissoring of the S-S bonding, as schematically illustrated in Figure S22. The cleavage in S-S bonding further facilitates the conversion from high-order LiPS to low-order one and finally to Li2S, thus endowing the catalysis property. Previous reports also demonstrated that in the reaction of tri- and tetra-sulfides, the S-S bond is vulnerable to be cleaved.[33] At this point one may raise a question about the survival of Li+ ion loop, since the facilitated redox reactions in sulfur electrochemistry to some extent rely on the intercluster Li+ exchange. As demonstrated previously,[27,36] the Li+ mobility mechanism between sulfide chains and clusters of sulfide chains to/from the DOL/DME solvent is not the only available pathway. It makes sense that the largely reduced solubility of LiPS in the presence of HMC means a more dilute electrolyte in the cell, the overwhelmingly dominant presence of LiTFSI (relative to the HMC) is sufficient to guarantee the Li+ loop during cell operation[20] (Figure S23) as well as fast ion transport, as highlighted by the markedly improved Li+ diffusion coefficient and better electrolyte wettability in the presence of HMC (Figure S24, S25).[27,34–35] In addition, recent investigations also demonstrated that the electrolyte with low viscosity is prone to trigger the co-aggregations of Li2S4 via participation in the Li2S2 aggregation, thus resulting in reduced S loss and rapid Li+ ion diffusion,[27,36] consistent with the proposed mechanism here. 3 Conclusion The anti-heterogeneous catalysis in Li-S batteries is exploited to simultaneously regulate the sulfur electrochemistry and protect Li anode via directly adding a slight amount (0.25 vol%) of amidomagnesium halide-HMC. In the presence of HMC, a better compatibility with lithium anode is achieved, which blocks the penetration of LiPS through SEI and the propagation of the dead Li and Li dendrite, resulting in stable Li stripping/plating and longer cycling lifespan. Meanwhile, the incorporation of HMC guarantees a much reduced dissolution of high-order LiPS species, which gives rise to a quasi-solid-state reaction and minimal LiPS shuttling. More importantly, the multistep conversion of sulfur elctrochemistry is substantially propelled with the manipulation of amidomagnesium halide chemistry, as revealed by DFT calculations and experimental studies including in situ UV–vis measurements. At an electrolyte-starved condition of 2.8 μL mg−1, the high-loaded Li-S pouch cells realize a high energy density of 423 Wh kg−1, as well as a decent cycling behavior. This anti-heterogeneous catalysis strategy affords new insights into realizing energy-dense Li-S batteries that can work reasonably under lean electrolyte condition. 4 Methods 4.1 Preparation of the electrolyte with HMC additive Non-nucleophilic hexamethyldisilazide magnesium chloride (HMC) was obtained by a chemical extraction method with hexamethyldisilazane (>99.0%) and ethyl magnesium chloride (EtMgCl) in THF.[16] The HMC (1.4 M solution in THF) was used as additive in electrolyte (1.0 M solution of lithium bis- trifluoromethanesulfonylimide (LiTFSI) with 1 wt% LiNO3 in DME/DOL mixture (1:1, vol.). Different concentrations of HMC (0.1 vol%, 0.25 vol% and 0.5 vol%) were added into the electrolyte and stirred for 20 min in an Ar-filled glove box to form uniform solutions. 4.2 Li/Cu cells and Li/Li symmetrical cells assembly and measurement Lithium metal disks with a diameter of 14.0 mm were used as counter electrode and Cu metal disks with a diameter of 14.0 mm were used as working electrode in Li/Cu cells. Li/Li symmetric cells which are composed of two identical lithium metal electrodes were separated by a Celgard 2400 polypropylene membrane. The CE of Li/Cu cells and the galvanostatic cycling of Li/Li symmetrical cells were performed on a Neware battery test system. The discharge/charge current density was 0.32 mA cm−2, and areal capacity was 0.32 mAh cm−2. Cells were set to automatically shut down when potential reached ±5.0 V. The Li/Li and Li/Cu cells after 500 h cycling were disassembled and rinsed with DME to remove salts of the electrolyte in an Ar-filled glove box. After rinsing, the samples were then sealed and taken out of the glove box for structural characterization and element analyse of the surface on Li anode.

      "dc:description": "The simultaneous engineering of sulfur cathode and Li anode is critical for electrolyte-starved high-energy–density Li-S batteries. Herein, we challenge the conventional wisdom of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalyses in Li-S batteries, the concept of anti-heterogeneous catalysis is proposed to synchronously realize effective LiPS trapping/conversion and protection of Li anode through employing a small amount of non-nucleophilic electrolyte additive of an amidomagnesium halide, hexamethyldisilazide magnesium chloride (HMC). Regulated by the amidomagnesium halide chemistry, over 1000 h of cycling is realized in Li/Li symmetric cells, revealing superb compatibility of the HMC-incorporated electrolyte with lithium metal. Meanwhile, via elevating the dissociation free-energy barrier of Li+ in LiPS, the liquid HMC catalysts significantly decrease the solubility of lithium ploysulfides and promote the multistep conversion of sulfur electrochemistry, which enable a quasi-solid-state reaction and minimal shuttle effect. Practically, a high energy density of 423 Wh kg−1 with decent cycling stability is achieved in electrolyte-starved pouch cells.",
