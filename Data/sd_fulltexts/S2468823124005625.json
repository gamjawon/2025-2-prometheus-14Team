Introduction The 3,3-disubstituted oxindole has garnered considerable attention in the scientific community due to its versatile applications and has emerged as a prominent player in the realms of pharmaceuticals and electrochemistry (Fig. 1 ) [1–5]. The development of an organic-based aqueous redox flow battery (RFB) using 3,3-disubstituted oxindole as an electroactive material has received considerable synthetic interest recently [6]. In the ideal synthetic strategy, indole serves as a valuable synthon for 3,3-disubstituted oxindole [7–9]. The direct process of di-functionalization of indoles has emerged as a highly popular method for the efficient synthesis of 3,3-disubstituted oxindole compounds [10–12]. As multifunctional 3,3-disubstituted oxindoles, the 3-substituted 3-halooxindoles as a versatile framework for the development of synthetic methods for various 3,3-disubstituted oxindoles [13–15]. On account of their functional features, efficient synthetic protocols have received significant interest in the generation of this particular molecule up to now [16–21]. One of the direct synthetic approaches usually involves the utilization of the isatin compound, which undergoes nucleophilic additions, ultimately obtaining the desired 3-substituted 3-halooxindoles (Scheme 1 a) [22]. Other 3-substituted 3-fluorooxindoles were synthesized by photoredox-catalyzed cross-dehydrogenative coupling of 3-fluorooxindoles (Scheme 1b) [4]. Nevertheless, the method was required to prepare 3-fluorooxindoles from hydrazonooxindole or 2- oxindole first [23–25]. It is important to take into account some drawbacks associated with this approach, including the requirement for additional oxidants, harsh reaction conditions, and noble-metal based photocatalysts. Therefore, it is imperative to address the aforementioned shortcomings and limitations of the current protocols. Based on existing research [26,27], it has been established that coupling and oxidative halogenation of indoles represent the most effective approaches for synthesizing multifunctional 3-substituted 3-halooxindoles. The photocatalytic direct 3-substituted 3-halooxidation strategy is gaining considerable and growing interest due to its alignment with the goals of environmentally friendly and sustainable synthetic methods [28–50]. An effective and one-pot synthesis approach for the construction of 3-substituted 3-fluorooxindoles has been developed recently and the method encompasses the utilization of the Ce(III)-photoassisted cross-dehydrogenative coupling /fluorooxidation [51]. Nonetheless, it still necessitated the use of photocatalyst and a reactor system that required heating. Herein, we first disclosed a convenient self-photocatalyzed coupling reaction between indoles and quinoxalin-2-ones under mild conditions. Subsequently, with the implementation of halogenation (fluorination, chlorination, bromination) and oxidation reactions in a unified process, the separation step for 3-(indol-3-yl)quinoxalin-2-ones is rendered unnecessary (Scheme 1c). The method provides feasible access to the diversity of C3-halogenated 3-heteroaryl-oxindoles at room temperature with good functional group tolerance, from which electrochemically active compounds can be easily constructed (Scheme 2). Results and discussion At the initiation of our investigation, a survey of reaction parameters was conducted utilizing indole (1a) and quinoxalin-2-one (2a). This survey involved the utilization of quinoxalin-2-one as a photocatalyst and selectfluor as a fluorinated reagent, resulting in the formation of 3-(3-fluoro-2-oxindolin-3-yl)quinoxalin-2-one (3a). The purpose of this protocol was to screen and evaluate various reaction conditions (Table 1 ). By systematically investigating solvents and wavelengths, the target compound (3a) was successfully obtained with a yield of 87 % using established reaction parameters (Table 1, entry 1). Under similar reaction conditions to those reported in the literature [51,52], it was found that no product (3a) was obtained using MeCN or THF as a solvent (Table 1, entry 2). As anticipated, the nature of the solvent exerted a crucial role in the Friedel–Crafts type coupling reaction outcome. While the reaction proceeded quite smoothly indeed in DCE reaction media, significantly worse results were obtained when using other solvents such as DCM, DMSO, DMF, EtOH (Table 1, entry 3). 1,4-Dioxane was also effective as a solvent for this reaction, delivering the product with 61 % yield (Table 1, entry 4). When mixed DCE/MeCN (1:1) was used as a solvent in this reaction, the yield of the product was not higher than 24 % (Table 1, entry 5). With the advantages of photocatalysis in mind, we turned our attention to the influence of visible light on this reaction. Remarkably, the removal of light resulted in the conspicuous absence of the target product (3a) (Table 1, entry 6). The effect of different light wavelengths on the model reaction was next investigated (Table 1, entries 7 and 8). Under the irradiation wavelength of 395 nm and 455 nm, 66 % and 85 % yields of 3a were obtained, respectively. Solvents play an important role in halogenation and oxidation reactions. It was found that the halogenation and oxidation reactions failed to occur and the target product (3a) was not detected when MeCN was not added to the reaction medium (Table 1, entry 9). This is consistent with some other reports in the literature [26]. However, when EtOH was added to the reaction solvents, 3a was obtained in a 78 % yield (Table 1, entry 10). Subsequently, the substitution of selectfluor with NFSI or fluoropyridinium triflate led to a substantial reduction in yields (Table 1, entries 11 and 12). Furthermore, the introduction of selectfluor in the Friedel-Crafts type coupling reaction did not provide any detectable amount of the desired product (3a) (Table 1, entry 13). The research findings suggest that the Friedel-Crafts type coupling and fluorination processes exhibited a competitive nature. Two-step method instead of one-step to reduce unwanted side reactions, such as the C3 difluorination of indoles [53]. With the optimized reaction conditions in hand, we set about assessing the generality of this reaction for indole (1), and quinoxalin-2-one (2). Initially, modifications were implemented on the nitrogen atom of indole (1) to introduce structural differences. A diverse array of N-substituents on the indole (1) exhibited favorable compatibility, resulting in the formation of the desired products (3a-3 h) with yields ranging from 70−87 %. By changing N-substituents to unsubstituted indole, the reaction also proceeded smoothly (3i). When a group that electrons donating or electrons withdrawing was present at positions 4 to 7 on the indole ring, the resulting product could be obtained with a yield ranging from 68 % to 88 % (3j-3p). Substrates containing electron-donating groups (methoxyl-) worked better than those with electron-withdrawing groups (fluoro-, bromo‑, cyano-, methyl ester-). In addition, when subjected to normal circumstances, the reaction between 7-azaindole and quinoxalin-2-one resulted in a product yield of 47 % (3q). Furthermore, changing the N-substitution of quinoxalin-2-one could influence its physical and chemical properties, in particular, the redox potentials. Altering the N-methyl group of quinoxalin-2-one (2) to different substituents (ethyl-, n-propyl-, allyl-, benzyl-) or leaving it unsubstituted, the yields decreased to 61 % (3r-3v). Subsequently, a diverse range of quinoxalin-2-one derivatives (2) bearing substituents at positions 6 and 7 were subjected to a very efficient reaction, resulting in the formation of the respective products (3w-3aa) with moderate to good yields. The target product (3ab) was obtained with a yield of 75 % using the 6,7-disubstituted quinoxalin-2-ones. Moreover, the utilization of functionalized 1-methyl-5,6-diphenylpyrazin-2-ones instead of quinoxalin-2-one in the reaction also resulted in the corresponding product (3ac) in a useful yield. Furthermore, the nature product Azacephalandole A can be easily incorporated synthetically by Friedel–Crafts coupling reaction, followed by subsequent fluorination and oxidation with selectfluor affords a direct one-pot route to Azacephalandole A derivative (3ad). The electroactive indole derivatives were elaborated as high-performance active materials for aqueous redox flow batteries [1,6,54]. To highlight the synthetic value of this reaction and consider the potential and intriguing applications of aqueous redox flow batteries (Scheme 3 a), further transformations of the 3-substituted 3-halooxindole product was conducted. The reaction system was sufficiently robust to convert 10 mmol (1.89 gram) of methyl indole-1-acetate to the compound 3ae in a 79 % yield. Then water-soluble 3-substituted 3-halooxindole compound 3af was obtained in good yields using 3ae as the starting material. At last, it was also anticipated that the process of halogenation-oxidation may potentially result in the synthesis of the 3-(3-halo-2-oxindolin-3-yl)quinoxalin-2-ones in a comparable manner. The suitability of halogenation reagents, specifically N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) and N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), for these reaction conditions has been demonstrated, resulting in good yields (Scheme 3b) [55–57]. When N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) was the halogenation reagent, the desired product 3-(3-iodo-2-oxindolin-3-yl)quinoxalin-2-one could be not formed from the corresponding indole and quinoxalin-2-one in a one-pot reaction. This result was mainly caused by the larger atomic size of the iodine atom. A series of control experiments were carried out to shed light on the reaction mechanism. Almost no product was obtained when the radical scavenger (TEMPO/BHT/BQ) was used as an additive (Scheme 4 a). The observed phenomenon could perhaps be attributed to interference occurring inside the radical route responsible for the synthesis of the intended product. Furthermore, the reaction was strongly inhibited by the addition of the singlet oxygen scavenger (1,4-Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, DABCO) (Scheme 4b). Under the standard reaction conditions, 9,10-diphenylanthracene (7) was converted into the peroxide product (7a) through a [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction, indicating that singlet oxygen was essential. Then, the aforementioned reaction was conducted in the presence of either nitrogen or an oxygen atmosphere, resulting in the formation of the product (3a) with a yield of 16 % or 89 %, respectively (Scheme 4c). This finding suggests that molecular oxygen (O2) was involved in the observed process. Besides, the presence of an H2 18O-labeled product of 3a was observed when the reaction was conducted in dehydrated solvents and H2 18O (Scheme 4d). The result indicated that the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group of the product (3a) originated from H2 18O. Further, when the reaction was performed under a dry DCE and MeCN, 3a was obtained in drastically decreased yield, indicating that trace water in organic solvents can play a crucial role in the construction of target compounds (Scheme S1). As mentioned above, reactive oxygen species play a key role in this transformation. To investigate this further, we used 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) to measure 1O2 generation by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2 a). Initially, no obvious signal was recorded for the substrate 2a solution without blue-light irradiation. However, strong TEMPO signals were detected after being irradiated with blue light for 5 min, which indicates that substrate 2a promotes the formation of active singlet-oxygen (1O2) species when irradiated with blue light. Lastly, the on/off irradiation experiment revealed that the Friedel–Crafts type coupling between indole and quinoxalin-2-one progressed smoothly under blue light, but no conversion was observed when the reaction mixture was stirred in the dark (Fig. 2b), confirming the light-dependency. A feasible mechanism (Scheme 5 ) has been hypothesized based on the findings of the aforementioned control trials and previous literature reports [58–64]. First of all, excitation of the substrate 2a by irradiation at 405 nm generates an excited-state species 2a*, which acts as a photocatalyst and undergoes an energy-transfer (ET) process with triplet oxygen (3O2) to deliver singlet oxygen (1O2) and regenerate the ground-state substrate. Then, a single-electron transfer (SET) occurred involving the interaction of quinoxalin-2-one (2a) and 1O2, resulting in the formation of the quinoxalin-2-one radical A and the species O2 •−. Next, the nitrogen radical intermediate B was formed through the nucleophilic addition of 1a to quinoxalin-2-one radical A. Subsequently, the further oxidation of intermediate B by the species O2 •− resulted in the formation of the crucial intermediate 3′a. In the meantime, the O2 •− abstracted hydrogen ion released hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Significantly, the conversion of intermediate 3′a to intermediate C was achieved with the utilization of selectfluor/NCS/NBS. Besides, the nucleophilic H2O molecule reacts with intermediate C at the C2 position of the indole compound to afford intermediate D. Finally, intermediate D undergoes the process of direct oxidation to afford the final product 3a/4a/5a. Conclusions In summary, a novel one-pot strategy for self-catalytic photochemical synthesis of multifunctional 3,3-disubstituted oxindoles was described. The protocol has excellent functional group compatibility and comprises visible-light-catalyzed Friedel-Crafts coupling, halogenation, and oxidation reactions. The major advantage of this method is that it does not require photocatalysts, oxidants, or bases, which provides an efficient and environmentally friendly approach for synthesizing electrochemically active oxindole-based compounds. Additionally, a series of control experiments suggested that a radical mechanism was responsible for this reaction. CRediT authorship contribution statement Kai Zheng: Writing – original draft.

The process involves photocatalytic Friedel–Crafts type coupling, halogenation, and oxidation reactions, which makes it practical and attractive. Moreover, this strategy contributes to the development of an efficient protocol for accessing electrochemically active 3,3-disubstituted oxindoles, which have potential applications in flow batteries.",
