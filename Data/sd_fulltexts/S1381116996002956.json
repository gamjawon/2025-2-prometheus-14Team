Discussed are HPA-n catalyzed reactions in homogeneous, biphasic, and heterogeneous systems as well as mechanistic aspects of the HPA-n catalysis. Keywords: Heteropolyanions; Catalysts; Oxidation; Dioxygen 1. Introduction Catalysis with polyoxometalates (POM) is a field of growing importance [ 1-5]. These cornpounds, having well-defined structures and remarkable acid-base and redox properties, attract increasing attention worldwide. The purpose of this paper is to review recent applications of Keggin-type heteropolyanions PMo12_4\"1- (HPA-n) as catalysts for aerobic liquid-phase oxidation. The HPA-n catalytic system, discovered by Matveev et al. in the 70s [6], is the most efficient and versatile catalyst system in the POM series for oxidation by 02 [7-9]. A HPA-n based catalyst is used in industry for the heterogeneous gas-phase oxidation of methacrolein to methacrylic acid [3]. Structurally, HPA-n, as well as many other heteropolyanions important for catalysis, be- Fax: + 31-15-2781415. 1381-1169/97/$17.00 Copyright 1997 Elsevier Science BN. All rights reserved. PII S 1 381 - l 169(96)00295-6 longs to the best known and most stable Keggin series. They have a well-known Keggin structure which is composed of a central P04 tetrahedron surrounded by 12 randomly distributed M006 and VO6 metal-oxygen octahedra [10] (Fig. 1). For the preparation of HPA-n, see [5-8]. 2. General principles In liquid-phase oxidation, HPA-n with n = 2-6 are used. These compounds are remarkable because they are reversibly acting oxidants under mild conditions [6,7]. The presence of a certain number of V ions in the heteropolyanions is essential. Thus, the all-molybdenum anion PMo 12O4o (HPA-0) fails to possess such redox properties under mild conditions; so does HPA-1 for reasons that will be discussed later. Generally reactions catalyzed by HPA-n pro- 152 LV. Kozheonikou/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 1170997) 151-158 Fig. 1. The Keggin structure of HPA-n (a-isomer). ceed via a stepwise Mars-Van Krevelen-type mechanism, HPA-n + Red + mH+--> Hm(HPA-n) + Ox (1) Hm(HPA-n) + Qm02 -+ HPA-n + ZmH20 (2) This mechanism includes stoichiometric oxidation of the substrate (Red) by HPA-n followed by reoxidation of the reduced form of the oxidant, H m(HPA-n), with dioxygen, where Hm(HPA-n) = H,n(pM0+6 Vltt+)(3+><)- m < n. Actually, it is the V 5+ V4+ transformation that is responsible for the redox properties of HPA-n. The reduction of HPA-n in solution is accompanied by its protonation to maintain the charge of the polyanion [10]. Reactions (1) and (2) can be carried out in the same reactor (one-stage process) or separately as a combination of two stoichiometric reactions (two-stage process) [6,7]. Thus HPA-n combines the advantages of stoichiometric and catalytic oxidations. As the catalysts, either one-component or two- and multicomponent systems are used. The most important two-component system includes HPA-n and Pd(II). Other two-component systems are also known, e.g. those including complexes of Pt, Ir, Ru, TI, etc. [7]. The thermodynamic condition for the occurrence of reactions (1) and (2) is: E(Red) < E(HPA) <_ E(02) = 1.23 V [7]. The oxidation potential E(HPA) is 0.68-0.71 V versus normal hydrogen electrode for HPA-n with n = 1-4 at pH 1 [11]. Hence the above condition fulfills for a wide variety of organic substrates as well as for many inorganic redox systems to be used as cocatalysts with HPA-n. 3. Catalytic reactions 3.1. Homogeneous oxidation 3.1.1. One-component HPA-n system A range of hydrocarbons can be homogeneously oxidized with HPA-n as catalyst under mild conditions. Thus HPA-n catalyzes the oxidation of alkanes to oxygenates by 02 [12], CA + OZ HPA-4 AcOH/HZO/PhCl, 150, 3h The mixed-addenda HPA-n are more efficient catalysts than the all-molybdenum heteropolyanions. Many synthetically attractive oxidations of hydrocarbons have been developed to date. For example, highly efficient dehydrogenation reactions with HPA-2 in CH2CICH2C1/tetraglyme solution have been reported by Neumann et al.

In industry it is carried out with highly toxic Cr03 as a stoichiometric oxidant with a low yield. With HPA-n, we have succeeded to carry out the catalytic oxidation in a higher yield [14]. Oxidative bromination of a range of aromatics catalyzed by HPA-n has been reported with HBr as a brominating agent and Oz as a terminal oxidant [15]. More recently Neumann et al. [ 16] reported the oxidative bromination of phenols in the para-position with a remarkably high yield, + HBr+1/20, HPA-n OH + H20 CH,CICH2CI ttetraglyme 20, 5 h Br Yield: 99 (6) Ishii et al.

A carboxylic acid as a cooxidation product is also formed. This may be synthetically useful if the carboxylic acid is a useful product. A variety of oxygenates, e.g. aldehydes, ketones, phenols, etc., can be oxidized with HPA-n under mild conditions with very good yields. Breault et al.

We [19,20] and also Neumann et al. [21] reported synthetically attractive oxidations of alkylphenols (Eq. (10)): the oxidation of 2,3,5trimethylphenol (TMP) to trimethylbenzoquinone (TMBQ) which is of practical interest as a step to synthesize vitamin E; and the oxidative coupling of 2,6-dialkylphenols to diphenoquinones which can be used for the synthesis of antioxidants.

For example, the oxidation of H 2 S to sulfur [22] and thioethers to sulfoxides and sulfones [23] proceeds with nearly 100% yield. 3.1.2. Two-component system HPA-n + Pd(11) The two-component redox system HPA-n + Pd(II), discovered by Matveev [6,24], has attracted considerable attention. A wide variety of stoichiometric oxidations of organic compounds (SH2), e.g. olefins, alcohols, arenes, etc., by (8) Pd(II) can be carried out catalytically with the 154 LV. Kozhevnikov /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 117 (1997) 151-158 use of HPA-n as a cocatalyst and OZ as an oxidant [4,7,8,25], Pd(I1) + HPA-n SH2+ 202 --j P+HZO (I1) Generally, such reactions proceed via a stepwise redox mechanism, P Pd(II) HPA-n OZ SHZ ( Pd(0) Hm(HPA-n) H20 (12) It is analogous to the Wacker-type oxidation with CuClz-PdC12 as the catalyst. But the HPA-n + Pd(II) catalyst can work in the absence or at a very low concentration of Clions. That is why it has the advantage of being more selective and less corrosive [6]. Most interesting is the application of the HPA-n + Pd(II) system for blacker-type oxidation of olefins: RCH=CHZ + Z OZ - RCOCH3 (13) The blacker process is industrially employed for manufacturing acetaldehyde from ethylene and acetone from propylene [26]. The CuCI,, + PdC12 redox system is used as a catalyst. However, this process has several drawbacks such as formation of chlorinated byproducts and strong corrosion of the reaction vessel. So the development of chloride-free oxidants to replace CuC12 has long been a challenge. Matveev [6,24] first proposed the use of HPA-n as chloride-free oxidant in the blacker reaction. The oxidation of ethylene can be represented by the following equations: CZH4 + Pd(II) + HZO - CH3CH0 + Pd(0) + 2H+ Pd(0) + HPA-n + 2H+ -+ Pd(II) + HZ(HPA-n) (15) HZ(HPA-n) + 202 - HPA-n + H20 (16) Catalytica [8] has recently developed new technology for the blacker oxidation of ethylene and higher olefins with the use of the HPA-n + Pd(II) system. In order to enhance the reaction (14) rate and to stabilize Pd(II) in solution, the reaction is carried out in the presence of C1- ions at a very low concentration (5-25 mM). In this process, over 99% of the production of chlorinated byproducts is eliminated, decreasing to less than 0.01 % yield on ethylene. 3.2. Biphasic reactions The advantage of biphasic systems is that they combine a catalytic reaction and product separation in one unit. POMs, due to their special solubility properties, offer interesting opportunities for this. It is especially promising for fine and specialty chemicals synthesis to avoid difficult separation problem. Matveev et al. [27] reported two-stage oxidation of 2-methyl- l-naphthol to menadione in a high yield with space-separated steps (17) and (18), step (17) being earned out in an aqueoushydrocarbon two-phase system, OH m/4 + HPA-n + M4 Hz0 50 ~ M4 + Hm(HPA-n) C,H16'H20 I 0 Conwrsnon: 100% Yeld: 89 Hm(HPA-n) + (4'-m)OZ 1 001c HPA-n + ( Z m ) H 20 H20 (1s) This is a promising alternative to the conventional synthesis of vitamin K 3 by oxidizing 2-methylnaphthalene with Cr03. We [28] have developed the efficient onestage oxidation of TMP to TMBQ in an ArHAcOH-H20 two-phase system, OH :& OZ HPA-n O + H20 PhMe /AcOH-H20 50 / O Conversion: 100% Yield: 84 (19) LV. Kozheunikou/Journal of Molecular Catalvsis A: Chemical 117 (1997) 151-158 Monflier et al. [29] reported the biphasic Wacker oxidation of 1-decene to 2-decanone with excellent yield and practically no double bond migration, NSO,MPA-6ICuSO, + 2 Oz _ HZO/\"yclodextIn 80oC, 6 h Yield. 98 (20) In this case a three-component catalyst System is used, containing Pd(II), HPA-6 and Cu(Il), where Cu(II) is suggested to promote the Pd reoxidation. The key point about this is the use of a cyclodextrin as a phase-transfer catalyst, which transfers 1-decene to the aqueous phase by a host-guest interaction. 3.3. Heterogeneous reactions Heterogenized HPA-n catalysts have attracted considerable interest. Both liquid-phase and gas-phase reactions have been studied. Neumann et al. [30] reported the liquid-phase oxidation of benzylic compounds (Eqs. (21) and (22)) with excellent yields with one-component HPAn system supported on activated carbon, which very strongly adsorbs POM. This catalyst has also been applied for the oxidation of TMP [31]. lo% H ~A-2/C ArCHO + H 20 MePh, 100, 22 h ArCH20H+ z02 (yield: 94-98%) ArCH2NH2 + OZ 10% HPA-n/C (21) ArCH=NCH2Ar (22) MePh, 100, 0.5 h (yield: 100%). Considerable attention has been paid to the heterogeneous two-component Pd(II) + HPA-n system, especially regarding gas-phase Wacker oxidation and related reactions. As a support, silica is generally used, which is relatively inert towards POM. There are two main problems in applying this system to the gas-phase oxidation: (1) the reoxidation of the catalyst by 02 pro- 155 ceeds much slower than in solution and (2) the catalyst rapidly becomes inactive due to aggregation of palladium. The oxidation of CO to C02 was reported by Matveev et al. [32], 1.5%Pd+7.5%HPA-4/SiO~_ 'CO + ,02 30 The Pd(II) + HPA-n catalyst was found to be more active than Pd/Ti02 and Pd/Si02. But eventually the catalyst exhibited irreversible deactivation. The heterogeneous oxidation of butene to methylethylketone is the most challenging goal [33,34]. It has recently been studied with both HPA-n and their Cu2+ salts [33], COZ (23) 0 Pd(II) HPA-NSi02 rrCaHe 112 OZ - CH3CHZCCH, 7odc Conversion: 60%-> 6% after t h Selectihty 98% -> 90 Nit+, Pd2+ and Cs+ (24) However, very strong deactivation was observed: the conversion dropped ten-fold after 1 h on stream. Yet very recently quite a stable activity after 50 h on stream has been obtained in the ethylene oxidation with the catalyst promoted by Mn2+ [35], C,) H4+;OZ PdCI~+ Mn=T-HPA-2/SiO~ CH3CHO (25) 70-1 oo (conversion: 80%, selectivity: 98o). It should be noted that reactions (23)-(25) are all carried out in the presence of steam. Mechanistically they can be considered as pseudohomogeneous, i.e, occurnng in the liquid catalyst phase entrapped in the support. 4. Mechanistic aspects HPA-n in solution is an extremely complex system, and the higher the n value is, the more 156 L V. Kozheunikou/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 1170997) 151-158 complex the system. The HPA-n solutions contain a great number of iso- and heteropolyanions, their positional isomers as well as monomeric vanadium oxocations [7,8]. This makes mechanistic studies very difficult. Much work has been done on characterization of the HPA-n solutions [7,8]. Recently Pettersson et al. [36] have fully characterized the HPA-2 solutions by potentiometry and 31 P and 51 V NMR. This is a relatively simple and stable system, which is used in Catalytica's new technology for Wacker oxidation of olefins [8]. It consists of five positional a-isomers and some (3-isomers of PMoloV O which have been identified by 31 P and A V NMR. As said earlier, the overall catalytic process can be represented by steps (1) and (2). The question is what is the mechanism of these steps? What kind of active species is involved? In step (1), two types of active species can be considered [7]. First, the monomeric VOZ cation and/or complexes thereof, which is formed via the dissociation of parent HPA-n. It is likely for HPA-n with higher n and in strong acidic media. For example, there is evidence that the monomeric VOZ is the active species in the oxidation of TMP (ArOH) (Eq. (19)). Such a mechanism can be represented by the following equations [20]: HPA-n VOz + HPA-(n - 1) (26) VO Z + ArOH + H+ - Ar0 ~+ VOZ++ Hz0 slow 0 0 VOz++ HPA-n + HZO VO+ + H(HPA-n) + H+ or VOZ++ HPA-(n - 1) + H +;a H(HPA-n) 4H(HPA-n) + OZ - 4HPA-n) + 2H20 The rate-determining step is probably oneelectron oxidation of the phenol by VOZ to form the phenoxy radical (Eq. (27)). Subsequent transformations of the phenoxy radical give quinone. V4+ formed in the reaction returns into the heteropolyanion either by an electron transfer (Eq. (29)) or by association with the lacunary species HPA-(n - 1) (Eq. (30)). Eventually, V4+ is reoxidized by OZ inside HPA-n (Eq. (31)). It should be noted that the free VO2+ ion is not oxidized by OZ in acidic solution. Secondly, parent heteropolyanions can be the active species step (1) [7]. It is likely in the case of the more stable polyanions with fewer V ions (e.g. HPA-2). As the heteropolyanions are multielectron oxidants, they can, in principle, react via a multielectron-transfer mechanism. In this sense, the oxidation of a test alcohol tBu(Ph)CHOH is of interest [37], -1e- -2e- + PhCHO ~ Ph--C(CH313 PhCCiCH313 OH O (29) (32) With two-electron oxidants, e.g. Pd(II), this alcohol gives a ketone (Table 1). With one-electron oxidants, e.g. Ce4+ and persulfate, the C-C bond cleaves to yield benzaldehyde. It is seen that VOz reacts as one-electron oxidant, (27) as expected. In contrast, HPA-6 predominantly acts as a two-electron oxidant, giving the ketone in 67% yield; simultaneously the one-electron oxidation probably by VOZ ions also takes Table 1 One- versus two-electron oxidation of t-Bu(Ph)CHOH a Oxidant PdCl2 Ce '+ S20g- VO;PMo6V604o Ketone (%) 100 6 6 1l 67 (30) PhCHO (%) - 94 89 63 33 (31) Yields (mol%) on converted alcohol; a little PhCOOH is also formed. 1. V. Kozheunikov /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 117 (1997) 151-158 place to give benzaldehyde (33%). This may be indicative of the heteropolyanion intermediacy in reaction (32). Much research has been done on the mechanism of oxidation of the reduced form of HPA-n (`blue') by OZ (Eq. (2)). For a review, see [7]. It should be noted that the one-electron oxidation of blue to form the HOz radical is highly unfavorable thermodynamically. That is why the HPA-1 blue, PMo 4+ O~ , is practically not oxidized by OZ under mild conditions in solution. The all-molybdenum HPA-0 blue is not oxidized either. For this reason, HPA-n with n > 1 are used as catalysts in low-temperature oxidations. It is noteworthy that the reoxidation of HPA-0 and HPA-1 by OZ proceeds readily at higher temperatures, e.g. > 200. Under such conditions, they are widely used for heterogeneously catalyzed gas-phase oxidations, e.g. oxidation of methacrolein and oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid. For a review, see [ 1,3]. It was found that the mechanism of step (2) depends on the degree of reduction of blue. Two systems were studied. The first one is a deeply reduced blue with n >_ 4, all the V present being reduced to V4+ [38]. This practically never happens in real catalytic reactions, but it is a very convenient model system. In this system, the reaction follows a simple kinetics: first order in both the blue and OZ. In the presence of a radical scavenger, i-PrOH, no acetone was found. So no free radicals are formed. Hence a 4-electron-transfer mechanism was proposed. The mechanism includes the formation of a complex between the blue and OZ followed by a stepwise 4-electron transfer therein [38], H,,,(HPA-n) + O, {H(HPA-n) . . . 02} -j -- ~ -j H_4(HPA-n) + 21120 (33) The second system is a weakly reduced blue (by less than 1 electron per Keggin unit) [39]. 157 This system is adequate to real catalytic systems and shows a more complex behavior. The reaction was found to be third order in V 4+, minus second in the parent HPA-n and first in 0,. The test with i-PrOH clearly showed the formation of free radicals. On these bases, a 3-electrontransfer mechanism was proposed, which is represented for HPA-3 by the following equations: 2PMo9VZ +V4+ = pM09V5+V4+ + + pM09V5+ + (34) PMo9V2 +V4++ PMo9V5+V~ + PMo9V~ + + PMoyV3 5+ PMoyV3 + + OZ + 311+ -j(3~ ~~ PMo9V3 + + Hz0 + HO slow PMo9VZ +V4++ HO\"+ H+ PMo9V3 + + 1120 (35) (36) (37) In steps (34) and (35), a 3-electron blue is formed by the fast electron exchange between 1-electron blues. Then the 3-electron blue is slowly oxidized by OZ via a 3-electron transfer to form the HO radical, which is finally trapped by any V4+ species [39]. Alternatively, the reaction can include the fast 2-electron oxidation to form hydroperoxo intermediate (step (38) instead of (35)) followed by a slow 1-electron transfer step (39) to give the HO' radical. This easily explains the reoxidation of HPA-2 blue. PM09V5+V4+ + + O~ + H+ PMo9V3 +-OOH PMo9V~ +-OOH + PMo9V2 +V4++ 211+ 2PMo9V~ + + H,O + HO slow Further, it was found that the free radicals generated in step (2) can, to some extent, affect the selectivity of the one-stage catalytic process [40]. But obviously, they do no harm in the case of the two-stage process. (38) (39) 158 LV. Kozheunikov /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 117 (1997) 151-158 5. Conclusion HPA-n is the efficient and versatile catalyst system for oxidizing by 02. Several promising processes based on HPA-n have been developed, e.g. the Wacker oxidation of olefins. Principal mechanistic features of HPA-n catalyzed reactions have been documented, although many details are yet to be disclosed. References [1] Y. Ono, in: Perspectives in Catalysis, J.M.
