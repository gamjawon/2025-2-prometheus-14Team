Temperature-programmed decomposition of these supported Mo(CO)6 samples occurred in two stages, except for the Si02-supported case. After evacuation at 70 C for 1 h, the stage at lower than 100 C disappeared. The second peak was still present even after refluxing in toluene for 2 h. After the first decomposition, the structure became Mo(CO)3ads. Catalytic activity of this Mo(CO)3ads species was investigated in allylic alkylation by reaction of linalyl acetate with diethyl sodiomalonate. With Mo(CO)3/Ti02, the best catalyst, various allylic alkyla- tions were carried out; these gave the desired products in high yields. The catalyst exhibited high regio- and stereoselectivity for the allylic alkylation. Introduction Studies of ir-allyl metal complexes derived from molybdenum [I], tungsten [2] and iron carbonyl complexes [3] in catalytic allylic substitu- tion reactions have developed useful synthetic methodologies for evaluating the sensitivity of regio- and stereoselectivity. The worth of these reactions will be further enhanced by greater stabilization of the metal catalysts. This problem has often been solved by supporting the catalyst on an organic polymer; then the supported metal catalyst becomes available for (1) separa- tion, recovery and re-use, (2) activation, and (3) chemo-, regio- and stereo- selectivity [4-6]. Molybdenum carbonyl supported on an inorganic polymer such as aluminium oxide exhibits high activities for hydrogenation [7] and metathesis [8], because of the fine dispersion of molybdenum carbonyl on that support. The easy preparation of the catalyst has promoted develop- *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/87/$3.60 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 184 ment of the reaction. However, this metal oxide-supported molybdenum carbonyl has not been employed in the liquid phase. Here, we wish to report some effects of the support on the reactivity and the selectivity in allylic alkylation with supported molybdenum carbonyl catalyst. Experimental Mo(CO)e was purchased from Strem Chemicals, Inc. TiOa (P-25) and SiOz (Aerosil-200) were purchased from Degussa Co. Al^Oy (JRC-ALO-4) and MgO (JRC-MgO-1) were Japan Reference Catalysts. ZrO^ was prepared by a published method [9]. Allylic acetates such as l-acetoxy-2-(.E)-butene, 3-acetoxy-l-octene, l-acetoxy-2-methylenecyclohexane [10], and 3-acetoxy- 5-carbomethoxycyclohex-l-ene [11, 12] were prepared by the reaction of the corresponding allylic alcohols with acetic anhydride. The other allylic acetates were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. Diethyl malonate, 2,2'-bipyridyl (bpy), and 0,JV-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetoamide (BSA) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. 2-Carbo- ethoxycyclopentanone was prepared by the Dieckmann condensation. Sodium hydride was employed after removal of mineral oil from 60% dispersion NaH (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.). Toluene was dis- tilled from sodium benzophenone ketyl. All reactions were run under an atmosphere of dry argon. Purification of products was carried out by means of column chromatography (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Wakogel C-200). UV spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-240 spectrophotom- eter, IR spectra on a Hitachi 260-50 spectrophotometer, ^H NMR spectra on Hitachi R-22 and Jeoico FX-200 spectrometers, and mass spectra on a Jeoico JMS-D300 spectrometer. Preparation of Mo(CO)s/TiO^ catalyst Samples (0.5 g) of TiO; (P-25, surface area: 54.5 m2 g~1) were treated with 300 torr of oxygen at 450 C, evacuated at the same temperature for 15 min, and then cooled to room temperature under vacuum. 13 mg (0.05 mmol) of Mo(CO)6 was added to the treated TiOa under a stream of purified argon gas; the mixture was evacuated at room temperature for 10 min. Then it was heated to 70 C and maintained at this temperature for 1 h; this was followed by evacuation at 70 C for 1 h. All other Mo(CO)3/metal oxide catalysts were prepared by the same procedure. The formation ofMo(CO)3/ metal oxide was estimated by comparison of its temperature-programmed decomposition (TPDE) with that ofMo(CO)3/Al203 [13]. Temperature-programmed decomposition (TPDE) experiment Mo(CO)e/metal oxide mixed as above was heated to 70 C and main- tained at this temperature for 1 h; this was followed by evacuation at 0 C for 1 h. The sample was heated at a rate of 5 C min\"1 under vacuum. The pressure change of the decomposed gas was monitored by a vacuum gauge which recorded automatically. 185 General procedure of catalytic ally lie alky lotion To a solution of carbanion derived from diethyl malonate (1) (0.16 g, 1.0 mmol) or 2-carboethoxycyclopentanone (2) (0.16 g, 1.0 mmol) with sodium hydride (27 mg, 1.1 mmol) in toluene (10 ml) was added allylic acetate (1 mmol) under argon atmosphere. The solution was added to a vessel in which Mo(CO)3/metal oxide catalyst prepared as above had been placed. This mixture was refluxed for 4 - 48 h under argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture was diluted with ether (50 ml) and the catalyst was removed from the mixture by filtration. Evaporation of solvents and purifi- cation by column chromatography (hexane/ethyl acetate=7/l) gave the product. 2-Carboethoxy-2-(2-propenyl)cyclopentanone (3) 2-Propenyl acetate (100 mg, 1 mmol) reacted with 2 (1 mmol) to afford 3 (180 mg, 92%): IR (neat) 1745, 1720, 1630, 1220, 1155 cm-1; ^ NMR (CCU) 6 1.22 (t, J = 7 Hz, 3H), 1.70 - 2.76 (m, 8H), 4.09 (q, J = 7 Hz, 2H), 4.93 (br, 1H), 5.09 (br, 1H), 5.63 (ddt,J= 16,10, 7 Hz, lH)ppm;MS m/e (rel.%) 196 (M4-, 13), 168 (75), 151 (30), 123 (49), 122 (47), 113 (41), 95 (100), 81 (36), 80 (97), 79 (44), 67 (74), 55 (44).

The measurement of TPDE of the mixture was carried out after evacuation for 1 h; two decomposition peaks appeared: at 188 200 W Temperature ( C) 200 *00 Temperature ('C) Fig. 1.

TPDE spectra of Mo(CO)n/TiO:2: (a) after evacuation at 0 C for 1 h, (b) after evacuation at 70 C for 1 h, (c) after refluxing in toluene for 1 h, (d) after reaction with allyl acetate in refluxing toluene for 1 h. ~100 C and at >170 C, as shown in Fig. 1. The TPDE spectrum of Mo(CO)e on SiO; possessed only one peak at 70 C (Fig. 1). Burwell and coworkers have reported that Mo(CO)3ads is formed after the first decompo- sition in the case of A1203 support [13]. In our TPDE experiments, the first decomposition peak areas of Mo(CO)6/Ti02 and Mo(CO)e/Zr02 are almost the same as that of Mo(CO)(,/Al203. Thus, decomposition at the first peak indicates the formation of Mo(CO)3ads on Ti02 and Zr02. The stability of Mo(CO)3/Ti02, whose second decomposition occurred at the lowest temperature, was investigated in further detail (Fig. 2). After the Mo(CO)e/Ti02 mixture was kept at 70 C for 1 h under vacuum, fol- lowed by evacuation at 70 C for 1 h, the TPDE spectrum b lost the first peak at 100 C and exhibited only one peak at 170 C. This spectrum b corresponded to spectrum c of Mo(CO)3/TiC>2, which had been refluxed in anhydrous and O^-free toluene for 2 h, followed by washing with the tolu- ene. Furthermore, after the same treatment of the toluene solution con- taining allyl acetate, spectrum d exhibited two peaks at 170 and 320 C. We can thus conclude that the Mo(CO)3/Ti02 that is prepared after evacuation at 70 C for 1 h is stable in refluxing toluene [13]. In the cases of A^O^, ZrOz and MgO, the same results were obtained. In the TPDE experiment of Mo(CO)6/Si02, the peak at 70 C almost disappeared after evacuation at 70 C for 1 h. These UV-diffuse reflectance spectra represent the coordination state of supported Mo(CO)e, which is different from that of Mo(CO)e, as shown in Fig. 3. The effect of supports was studied in allylic alkylation with a catalytic amount of Mo(CO)3ads prepared above. To do this, the reaction of linalyl acetate with diethyl sodiomalonate was carried out (eqn. (1), Table 1). 189 ion 360 280 ,-', 1.0 240 .'V ' a 500 Wavelength (nm) 500 Wavelength (nm) Fig. 3.

The results of both the TPDE experiment and the reaction suggest that Mo(CO)n species is not supported on SiO; in these conditions. Mo(CO)3/Ti02 exhibits catalytic activity equal to that of homogeneous Mo(CO)e [1] and does not cause side reactions (entries 1 and 6). On the other hand, in the cases of A^Oa, ZrOa and MgO, the yields are lower than that, for a side reaction has occurred to give j3-myrcene and its isomer. It is presumed that the side reaction takes place through the abstraction of a-proton to w-allylmolybdenum intermediate by supports [14], because 190 A1203, ZrOa and MgO have more basic sites than TiO; on the surface, as shown in Table 2. The ability to support should depend on the number of the basic sites; therefore SiO;, which has no basic sites, could not support Mo(CO)n. Thus in these conditions, TiOs is superior to the other oxides in terms of a combination of supporting ability and neutrality. Coordinating solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane and acetonitrile decelerate the reaction relative to toluene. Addition of 1,2- bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane poisons the catalyst. The supported Mo(CO)3 catalyst cannot be re-used because it is very air-sensitive [13].

Allylic alkylation of various allylic acetates: regio- and stereoselectiuity Reaction of allylic acetates with the anion of diethyl malonate (1) and 2-carboethoxycyclopentanone (2) in the presence of Mo(CO)3/Ti02 leads to the desired allylic alkylation products. The results of representative experi- ments are summarized in Table 3. The anion 1 regioselectively attacks the more substituted allylic posi- tion (entries 6 and 8), and the anion 2 attacks the primary carbon to give only one isomer (entries 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9). Trostand coworkers have described the regiochemistry in the reaction of ir-allylmolybdenum and tungsten complexes with some nucleophiles in detail [1, 2]. In terms of the regio- selectivity for Tr-allylmolybdenum complex shown in Fig. 4, the higher reactivity of the anion 1 (pKa 13.3 [15]) and its minimum steric require- ments lead to its attack at C(a), which is more cationic than C(b) in our system as well as in Trost's.

Steric demands of ff-allyl substituents are revealed in the reaction of 2-cyclohexenyl acetate, which has no primary allylic position. This acetate exhibits some reactivity with anion 1 (entry 7), but none at all with the bulky anion 2. The large steric demands of this metal template, compared with those of homogeneous Mo(CO)e, are demon- strated by the fact that the reactivity of geranyl acetate is lower than that of linalyl acetate for formation of Tr-allyl intermediate (entries 4 and 5). 1 or 2 2. bpy Ph-,- N.R.< ^ Ph^/OAc - r ^ toluene toluene h reflux reflux Ha 90 ph^ OAc 2 Ha lib toluene reflux without bpy 38 62 with bpy 81 19 0 Ph~ HP 10 (2) (3) 192 Cinnamyi acetate did not react with 1 and 2 in the presence of Mo(CO)3/Ti02, in contrast with the case of homogeneous Mo(CO)e [1]. Addition of 5 mol% of 2,2'-bipyridyl (bpy) caused a nucleophilic attack of 2 at a benzylic position to produce 11 in 61% yield (eqn. 2). 3-Acetoxy- 3-phenyl-l-propene, the regio isomer of cinnamyi acetate, reacted with 2 whether bpy was used or not, and 11 was obtained in 24% (without bpy) or 51% (with bpy) yield (eqn. 3). Cinnamyi acetate should not cause ir-coordi- nation to Mo(CO)3ads without bpy, because of the steric effects of Mo(CO)3/ TiO; and the phenyl group. Exchange of CO for bpy, which easily made the coordination-decoordination, should eliminate the steric hindrance and as a result should facilitate the Tr-coordination of cinnamyi acetate. The regio- selectivity should be affected by both the stability of the initial product and the charge density on the benzylic position beyond steric demands of the nucleophile, similar to the case of the homogeneous system [1]. In addition, it is presumed that some Mo(CO)n species exist on TiO; after refluxing in toluene containing bpy, as shown in Fig. 5. ^ \"s ^ a AcCT^-COOMe g^ E2CH'v\\COOMe E2CHt''VSCOOMe (4) 12 -100% 0 To demonstrate the effectiveness of Mo(CO)3/Ti02 catalyst for stereo- selective attack of the nucleophile, 3-acetoxy-5-carbomethoxycyclohex- 1-ene was employed [1, 2, 12]. This allylic acetate stereoselectively reacted with diethyl malonate in the presence of 0,JV-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetomide (BSA) to give only Z-isomer 12 in 81% yield (eqn. 4). It is known that the homogeneous Mo(CO)6 catalytic reaction proceeds with double inversions in both the formation of Tr-allylmolybdenum complex and the nucleophilic attack to the complex [1]. In this heterogeneous system, a blocking effect of the bulky support TiO^ should further favor the selectivity of the double inversions.

This is presumably attributable to the steric hindrance between the bulky acetates and the bulky nucleophile 2. Conclusions Mo(CO)3 species supported on TiO;, A^Oa, ZrO; and MgO are stable in refluxing toluene under argon atmosphere and catalyze allylic alkylation by reaction of allylic acetates with carbon nucleophiles. In particular, Mo(CO)3/Ti02 is an excellent catalyst and seems to be more long-lived than homogeneous Mo(CO)6. The catalyst exhibits regio- and stereoselecti- vity for the allylic alkylation. Steric and electronic demands of the metal template afford slightly different activity and selectivity from those of the homogeneous system. References 1 B. M. Trost and M. Lautens, J. Am. Chem.
