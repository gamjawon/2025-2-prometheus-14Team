Developing an efficient and low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts with superior activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly required but still challenging. Herein, highly dispersed Ni species containing both Ni nanoparticles (NPs) and atomically dispersed Ni-NX on mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon (Ni-N-C) were prepared by a facile one-pot pyrolysis strategy using dicyandiamide, citric acid and nickel acetylacetonate as raw materials. The confinement agent citric acid is quite requisite for dispersing Ni NPs and forming mesoporous graphene-like carbon substrate. Due to the uniform size of Ni NPs (3 nm) and the synergistic effect between Ni NPs and Ni-NX, and the unique mesoporous carbon structure, such Ni-N-C catalyst exhibits favorable activities for both HER and OER. The overpotentials for HER and OER are only 218 and 330 mV vs. RHE on glassy carbon to deliver a current density of 10 mA·cm−2, respectively. Moreover, this catalyst also showed good operation durability with no obvious deactivation after long-term (18 h) potentiostatic electrolysis or continuous CV tests. This work could offer a new avenue for the design of bifunctional electrocatalysts in efficient water splitting.

Hydrogen (H2) is an ideal substitutes for fossil fuels due to the advantages of high energy density and zero pollution [1]. Among multiple methods [2–4], the production of H2 by electrochemical water splitting is considered to be an effective strategy. In principle, overall water electrolysis involves two half reactions, consisting of cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [5,6]. A high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalyst is highly needed to facilitate both HER and OER. To date, precious metal-based materials such as Pt and RuO2 or Pt and IrO2 has been recognized as the most advanced catalysts for HER and OER [7], respectively. Nevertheless, the high cost and scarcity greatly limit their widespread application in electrolysis. Therefore, the search for cost-effective non-noble metal-based catalyst has become a hotspot in recent years. Transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni)-based catalysts, such as nitrides [8], sulfides [9], phosphides [10], carbides [11], borides [12] and oxides [13–15], have proved to be the most promising substitute for water electrolysis because of their similar valence electron configurations. However, issues such as low electrical conductivity, limited active surface area, and poor operation stability, are still needed to be resolved. To enhance the performance of transition metal-based catalysts, several strategies have been proposed, including composition or electronic structure optimization, materials nanostructuring and hybridization. Among them, construction of hybrid materials consisting transition metals on highly porous and conductive materials shows great application prospect for water splitting. Generally, carbon materials, especially nitrogen-doped carbon (NC), has been used in various electrochemical applications attributing to their good electrical conductivity, large specific surface area (150– 1500 m2·g −1) and excellent chemical stability [16–19]. The combination of transition metals with NC materials (M-N-C) has recently received increasing attention in both HER and OER. So far, various types of M-N-C catalysts have been reported for water splitting, such as Ni-N-C [20,21], Fe-N-C [22], Co-N-C [23], Mn-N-C [24], etc. Hoang et al. [25] successfully prepared nitrogen-doped activated carbon supported Ni/NiO bifunctional electrocatalysts, exhibiting good HER and OER catalytic performance. The synergistic effect between metallic Ni and NiO, and the hierarchical porous structure of the carbon matrix account for its excellent catalytic performance. Although great progress has been made in water spitting, most M-N-C catalysts are subjected to insufficient porous structure and non-uniform metal particles size, which ultimately lead to decreased catalyst performance. The selection of carbon sources has great influence on both size and structure of M-N-C catalysts. Compared with commercial carbon materials (graphene or carbon nanotubes), carbonaceous precursors including MOF, polyaniline and melamine are more conducive to achieving controlled morphology, increased specific surface area and highly exposed active sites. In particular, citric acid (CA) received a lot attention to synthesize various M-N-C catalysts. On the one hand, the three carboxyl groups of CA can stabilize metal ions, promoting the dispersion of metal species. On the other hand, porous structure can be generated from the abundant gasses decomposed by CA, which will accelerate the mass transportation and active sites exposure. Currently, the CA-derived M-N-C catalysts have been widely applied in oxygen reduction reaction [26–28], while studies for electrochemical water splitting have been seldomly investigated. Inspired by this, a simple one-pot pyrolysis method was proposed to synthesize uniform Ni nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on mesoporous carbon electrocatalyst (Ni-N-C) using citric acid (CA), dicyandiamide (DCDA) and nickel acetylacetone (Ni(acac)2) as precursors. The influence of pyrolysis temperature on the structure of Ni-N-C and performances for HER and OER were investigated in detail. By virtue of the strong chelating interactions between CA and Ni2+, and the pore-forming abilities of CA and DCDA, the resulted Ni-N-C demonstrated uniform Ni NPs with size of ca. 3 nm and a mesoporous carbon matrix. Remarkably, the Ni-N-C showed excellent electrochemical performances for HER and OER, requiring low overpotentials of about 218 and 330 mV, respectively, to reach a current density of 10 mA·cm−2. In addition, this catalyst demonstrated a high durability during long-term electrolyzing without obvious activity degradation. This work will shed a rational design of bifunctional M-N-C catalysts for water splitting. 2 Experimental All chemicals, including nickel acetylacetonate (Ni(acac)2, 95%), citric acid (CA, 99.5%), ethanol (C2H5OH, ≥99.7%), acetone (C3H6O, AR) and potassium hydroxide (KOH, 99.99%), were received from Aladdin (Shanghai). Potassium thiocyanate (KSCN, 98.5%), dicyandiamide (DCDA, AR) and Nafion solution (5 wt%) was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. The N2 employed in the test was of high-purity and provided by Yuanzheng Technology (Henan). 2.1 Material synthesis Synthesis of Ni-N-C-x catalysts: Typically, 3 mmol DCDA, 10 mmol CA and 1 mmol Ni(acac)2 were dissolved in a mixture of 4 mL of ethanol and 1 mL of acetone. After grinding to dry, the powder was placed in a tube furnace and pyrolyzed at various temperature (800 °C, 900 °C and 1000 °C) under N2 atmosphere for 1 h with a heating rate of 5 °C·min−1. The final black powder was achieved until the furnace was cooled down and marked as Ni-N-C-x (x = 800, 900 and 1000). For the sake of comparison, NC-900 was synthesized by similar preparation steps as Ni-N-C-900 except for no introduction of Ni (acac)2. Synthesis of Ni-N-C-900-acid catalyst: The Ni-N-C-900-acid was synthesized by treating the prepared Ni-N-C-900 in 2 M H2SO4 at 80 °C for 5 h. 2.2 Material characterization The morphologies and microstructures of materials were determined using field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL JSM-7001F) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F). The crystal structure of materials was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/Max-2500). The surface element composition and chemical structure were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB-250Xi). The specific surface areas and pore properties of catalysts were measured by N2 adsorption-desorption experiments (Micromeritics, ASAP 2010). The defect degree of catalysts were obtained from Raman spectra (Renishaw, inVia). The content of Ni in the materials were calculated by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Agilent 720). 2.3 Electrochemical measurements In this study, a three-electrode system and a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument) were employed to evaluate the catalyst activity. The electrolyte was 1 mol·L −1 KOH aqueous solution having a pH of 13.8. The glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 5 mm in diameter) coated with catalyst layer was used as the working electrode and the Hg/HgO electrode was used as the reference electrode. Whilst, the graphite rod was taken as the counter electrode. Generally, the catalyst ink was obtained by sonicating 5 mg of the catalyst in 30 μL 5 wt% Nafion solution and 970 uL ethanol for 30 min. Then, 30 μL of the catalyst ink was dropped on the polished glassy carbon electrode to acquire a mass loading of 0.75 mg·cm−2. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were recorded with a scan rate of 5 mV·s −1 in the potential range of 0–0.8 V vs. RHE for HER and 1–2 V vs. RHE for OER. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were performed at open circuit potentials from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were conducted to assess the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) in the potential window of 0.16–0.26 V vs. RHE at different scan rates (10–60 mV·s −1). For ease of comparison, all potentials were converted to reversible hydrogen electrodes (RHE) through the equation: E(vs. RHE)=E(vs. Hg/HgO)+0.0591 pH+0.098. 3 Results and discussion As shown in Fig. 1 , the Ni-N-C-900 was obtained via one pot pyrolysis of precursors containing dicyandiamide (DCDA), nickel acetylacetonate (Ni(acac)2), and citric acid (CA) at different temperatures. CA acted as both carbon source and chelating agent to stabilize Ni2+, while DCDA and Ni(acac)2 were used as nitrogen and Ni sources, respectively. Meantime, the electrostatic interaction between the carboxyl group on CA and the amine group on DCDA was favorable to nitrogen doping. In the pyrolysis procedure, CA and DCDA decomposed to produce abundant gaseous products, such as CO, NH3, etc., contributing to a porous structures in the catalyst. At the same time, part of Ni2+ from Ni(acac)2 was captured by N atoms to form single Ni-NX sites. The uncaptured Ni2+ is in-situ reduced to uniform Ni nanoparticles (NPs) by carbothermal or the generated reducing gas. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) result showed that the Ni loading in the Ni-N-C-900 catalyst was 16.65 wt%. Fig. 2 a showed the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared catalysts. The pristine NC sample exhibited only a broad peak of the (002) plane of graphitic carbon at about 26° Compared with the NC catalyst, the intensity of the C (002) diffraction peak of the Ni-N-C-x catalyst is significantly enhanced, indicating that Ni introduction was beneficial to the enhanced graphitization. In addition, three other strong peaks at 44.5°, 51.8° and 76.4° were also noted, corresponding to (111), (200) and (220) planes of cubic Ni0 (JCPDS#04–0850) [29]. Meanwhile, the diffraction peaks intensity of metallic Ni gradually enhanced with increasing pyrolysis temperature, indicating the larger size of Ni nanoparticles (NPs). Raman spectra (Fig. 2b) presented two characteristic peaks at 1345 and 1590 cm−1, corresponding to the disordered carbon (D-band) and graphitized carbon (G-band) [30]. The D/G intensity ratio (ID/IG) of NC-900, Ni-N-C-800, Ni-N-C-900 and Ni-N-C-1000 catalysts were calculated to be 1.023, 1.049, 1.09 and 1.067, respectively. The higher ID/IG ratio of Ni-N-C-900 indicated that more structural defect existed in this sample. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images in Fig. 2c showed that Ni-N-C-900 exhibited a uniform structure with NPs closely anchoring on the surface of carbon substrate. Similar morphology was also noted over NC (Fig. S1) and Ni-N-C-800 (Fig. S2) samples. In contrast, Ni-N-C-1000 (Fig. S3) showed network structure with many large aggregates embedding in it. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Figs. 2d and S4 further revealed a graphene-like porous structure decorated with well-dispersed Ni NPs having an average size of ∼3 nm. The HRTEM image in Fig. 2e validated the formation of Ni NPs on carbon network, showing lattice spacings of 0.21 and 0.35 nm for Ni (111) and C (002) planes, respectively. The SAED pattern in Fig. 2f illustrated that the Ni-N-C-900 has a polycrystalline structure, presenting diffraction rings of (111), (200), and (220) planes of Ni0 as well as (002) plane of carbon. The aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (ACHAADF-STEM) image confirmed many single Ni atoms uniformly distributed in the carbon matrix (Fig. 2g). The corresponding energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) elemental mapping (Fig. 2h and i) further showed that the C, N and Ni elements were highly dispersed in the whole carbon matrix. The surface structure and elements composition of obtained catalysts were analyzed and characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS full spectrum of Ni-N-C-x (Fig. 3 a) confirmed the presence of C, N, O and Ni elements. Quantitative analysis results (Table S1) showed that Ni-N-C-900 has a higher Ni content in the surface, which was beneficial to provide a high density of active sites. The high-resolution Ni 2p spectra (Fig. 3b) of the Ni-N-C-x exhibited peaks at 854.2 and 871.5 eV of metallic Ni0, and peaks at 855.6 and 874.5 eV of Nin+ (0 < n < 2) [31,32]. The N 1 s spectra (Fig. 3c) were deconvoluted into four peaks, corresponding to pyridinic−N (398.4 eV), Ni-NX (399.4 eV), pyrrolic-N (400.2 eV) and graphitic-N (401.2 eV), respectively. The noted peak at 399.4 eV confirmed the existence of atomically dispersed Ni species. All of these multiconfigurations of N were deemed to be advantageous to electrochemical process [33]. As for C 1 s spectra (Fig. 3d), two main peaks relating to C=C/C–C (284.8 eV) and C=N/C–N (286.4 eV) bonds were presented [2]. The presence of C=N/C–N confirmed the N atoms were successfully doped into the carbon matrix. The porosity of the prepared catalysts was characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. It can be seen that the adsorption/desorption curves (Fig. 3e) of all samples showed typical IUPAC IV type isotherms with H3 type hysteresis loops (P/P0>0.4), indicating the presence of mesopores [11,34]. The corresponding pore size distributions (Fig. 3f) verified the mesoporous structure of prepared samples, with pores mainly concentrated in 2–3 and 5–11 nm. The presence of mesoporous structure was advantageous to reveal more active sites and enhance the performance of water splitting. The mesoporous structure can also increase the wettability of the catalyst, provide channels for electrolyte penetration and facilitate the desorption of produced O2 and H2 bubbles [35,36]. The specific surface area of the NC sample was 259.14 m2·g −1 and the pore volume was 0.13 cm3·g −1 (Table S2). After incorporation of Ni species, the pore volume of Ni-N-C-x increased and achieved the maximum (0.24 cm3·g −1) over the Ni-N-C-900. Moreover, the Ni-N-C-900 exhibited a large specific surface area of 208.44 m2·g −1. All above results indicated that Ni-N-C-900 would exhibit superior electrochemical properties on account of its sufficient active sites and accelerated mass transportation. Based on the above-mentioned understanding, a standard three-electrode system was used to study the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of prepared catalysts in 1 M KOH solution using Pt/C as a benchmark. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves (Fig. 4 a) showed that the current density of all samples gradually increased with the negative shift of potentials. The overpotential was as low as 218 mV for the Ni-N-C-900 at current density of 10 mA·cm−2 (η 10), which was comparable to many reported electrodes (Table S3). Moreover, the value was much smaller than those for Ni-N-C-800 (η 10 = 431 mV), Ni-N-C-1000 (η 10 = 307 mV) and NC-900 (η 10 = 819 mV). Accordingly, The Ni-N-C-900 presented a Tafel slope of 169.4 mV·dec−1, which was the smallest one for all the prepared samples (Fig. 4b). This suggested the accelerated reaction dynamics of the Ni-N-C-900 and rate-determining step of HER being the Volmer reaction [32]. Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was further conducted to understand the kinetics of the charge transfer in the HER process. As evidenced from the Nyquist plots and corresponding fitted equivalent circuit model (Fig. 4c and inset of Fig. 4c), it is obvious that Ni-N-C-900 has the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct = 7.94 Ω) (Table S4), implying its fastest electron transfer stability [37]. The EIS results were consistent with the HER with Ni-N-C-900 showing the smallest overpotential, suggesting the synergistic effect between single Ni-NX sites and Ni NPs in mesoporous structure can accelerate the electrolyte penetration and reduce ions diffusion resistance. To investigate the origin of the superior HER activity of the Ni-N-C-900, the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was obtained by measuring cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at different scan rates. The Cdl value was in direct proportion to its electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) [38] (Fig. 4d and S5). As shown in Fig. 4e, the pristine NC-900 exhibited small Cdl value of only 0.49 mF·cm−2, while the Ni-N-C-900 has the highest Cdl value of 112.28 mF·cm−2, implying the dominant role of Ni element in the electrochemical process. The Cdl value of the Ni-N-C-900 was about 2 times and 4.4 times larger than those of Ni-N-C-800 (61.62 mF·cm−2) and Ni-N-C-1000 (25.48 mF·cm−2), convincing its largest ECSA and highest exposure of active sites for HER. In addition to catalytic activity, the catalytic stability is also an important factor that must be considered. As shown in Fig. 4f, the current density of the Ni-N-C-900 was basically unchanged during the continuous potentiostatic electrolyzing for 18 h at -0.34 V vs. RHE. While for the Pt/C, the activity declined slowly with prolonging the electrolysis time. After 1000 and 2000 CV cycles, the LSV curves of the Ni-N-C-900 almost coincided with the initial one (Fig. S6). All these results signified the excellent durability of the Ni-N-C-900 towards HER. In addition, XRD, FESEM, TEM and XPS characterizations were carried out to examine Ni-N-C-900 after long-term HER stability test. XRD patterns (Fig. 5 a) of the Ni-N-C-900 remained almost unchanged before and after the stability test. The Ni 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 5b) showed a little decrease in the peak intensity of Ni0 and an increase in that of Nin+. The reason for the partial oxidation of Ni NPs after stability test may be ascribed to its long-time exposure to KOH solution and the inevitable oxidation of Ni0 by air during the sample transfer process [39,40]. Furthermore, no obvious changes in morphology was noted after the stability test (Fig. S7), also indicating a good chemical stability of the Ni-N-C-900. In addition to HER activities, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of the samples were also investigated in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The experimental results showed that the pyrolysis temperature has a significant effect on the activity of OER. As shown in Fig. 6 a and b, the overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA·cm−2 decreased distinctly from 489 mV of Ni-N-C-800 to 334 mV of Ni-N-C-900, and then augmented to 487 mV in the Ni-N-C-1000, demonstrating the superior activity of Ni-N-C-900. In contrast, NC-900 presented the worst OER activity, possessing a high overpotential of 1030 mV at 10 mA·cm−2. Additionally, the Ni-N-C-900 has a smaller Tafel slope of 145.1 mV·dec−1, demonstrating a more rapid kinetics for OER process (Fig. 6c). Moreover, the Ni-N-C-900 exhibited exceptional stability during the long-term (18 h) electrolyzing (Fig. 6d). The above discussion confirms the determining function of Ni species in promoting both HER and OER. To further clarify the nature of the active sites for HER and OER in the Ni-N-C-900, a series of controlled experiments were conducted. The Ni-N-C-900 was first treated with 2 M H2SO4 for 5 h at 80 °C to elucidate the catalytic role of Ni NPs, the derived Ni-N-C-900-acid showed decreased activity for HER and particularly for OER, indicating the Ni NPs might the main active sites for OER. Further, KSCN was introduced to the electrolyte to selectively block the single Ni-Nx sites in the Ni-N-C-900-acid to determine the catalytic role of Ni-NX sites [41,42]. It was noted that the KSCN-treated Ni-N-C-900-acid showed limited decrease in OER activity but a prominent decrease in HER activity, which clarified the crucial role of Ni-Nx configurations for facilitating HER, which was consistent with the reported result [41]. The above discussion confirmed the synergistic effect of Ni-Nx sites and Ni NPs in promoting both HER and OER performance. 4 Conclusion In summary, we have successfully designed a highly dispersed Ni-N-C bifunctional catalyst for both HER and OER via a universal one-pot pyrolysis strategy. The employment of confinement agent citric acid was significant to restrain the agglomeration of Ni species and promote the generation of graphene-like carbon network. Benefiting from the mesoporous carbon structure, the uniform Ni NPs (3 nm) and their synergistic effect with atomically dispersed Ni-Nx sites, the optimized Ni-N-C possessed high activity for HER and OER. The current density of 10 mA·cm−2 only needs a low overpotential of 218 mV, which is equal to the values of reported NC-based electrocatalysts. At the same time, this catalyst also has good catalytic activity for OER, presenting overpotential of 330 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA·cm−2, demonstrating a broad application prospect for water electrolysis. Additionally, the Ni-N-C exhibited excellent operation stability within long-term electrolyzing towards both HER and OER tests. This study may provide a new avenue for the design and construction of practical and efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting.

        "dc:description": "Developing an efficient and low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts with superior activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly required but still challenging. Herein, highly dispersed Ni species containing both Ni nanoparticles (NPs) and atomically dispersed Ni-NX on mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon (Ni-N-C) were prepared by a facile one-pot pyrolysis strategy using dicyandiamide, citric acid and nickel acetylacetonate as raw materials. The confinement agent citric acid is quite requisite for dispersing Ni NPs and forming mesoporous graphene-like carbon substrate. Due to the uniform size of Ni NPs (3 nm) and the synergistic effect between Ni NPs and Ni-NX, and the unique mesoporous carbon structure, such Ni-N-C catalyst exhibits favorable activities for both HER and OER. The overpotentials for HER and OER are only 218 and 330 mV vs. RHE on glassy carbon to deliver a current density of 10 mA·cm−2, respectively. Moreover, this catalyst also showed good operation durability with no obvious deactivation after long-term (18 h) potentiostatic electrolysis or continuous CV tests. This work could offer a new avenue for the design of bifunctional electrocatalysts in efficient water splitting.",
