AUGUSTINE* and LIU JIWAN** Department of Chemistry, Seton Hall University, South Orange, NJ 07079 (U.S.A.) (Received April 12, 1988; accepted February 27, 1989) Summary A series of catalysts composed of Pd metal supported on inorganic oxides having pendant phosphine groups on their surfaces was subjected to single turnover (STO) reaction characterization. It was found that the nature of the oxide support and the pendant phosphine both influence STO pro- duct formation. Alumina-supported catalysts produce less isomerization than do those supported on silica-magnesia or silica. Alkyldiarylphosphine- containing catalysts give more stable metal alkyi formation than those having a triarylphosphine group. Introduction We recently reported on a new class of catalysts composed of Pd metal supported on inorganic oxides having pendant phosphine groups on their surfaces [1]. It was proposed that these materials be termed Pd/MO^ P catalysts. Two general classes of these catalysts were described, each having as the oxide support silica, alumina, or silica-magnesia. One of these series had a triphenylphosphine analogue attached to the oxide surface by way of a siloxane group and the other had a pendant alkyldiphenylphosphine group. While these materials were quite efficient alkene hydrogenation catalysts, a marked difference in the rates of cyclohexene hydrogenation was observed between these two groups of catalysts. Those species with the triphenylphos- phine group were more active than those having the alkyldiphenylphosphine moiety. The nature of the oxide support had no effect on the rate of hydro- genation in a hydrocarbon solvent. It was thought that further information concerning the nature of these catalysts might be obtained with our single turnover (STO) reaction sequence [2]. * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. **Present address: Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University, Wuhan (China). 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 10 Experimental The STO apparatus, reaction sequence, analytical techniques and gas purification procedures have all been described [2, 3], as has the catalyst preparation sequence [1].

Samples (25 mg) of each Pd/MO^ P catalyst, I-VI, were placed in the STO reactor tube which was inside a jacket through which thermostatted water was pumped to maintain a constant reaction temperature. The reactor was purged with pure He for 30 min and the STO reaction sequence begun, using 20 Jul pulses of the reactants. As usual [2, 3], several initial STO sequences were required to reduce the metal surface so reproducible data could be obtained. The STO reactions were run at several temperatures between 20 and 60 C for each catalyst, comprising at least five STO se- quences run over each catalyst at each temperature with reproducibility observed over the last 2 - 3 runs. The product chromatograms obtained at selected temperatures are shown in Figs. 1 and 2; the STO site densities of these catalysts are listed in Table 2. The GC-MS data were obtained using the same reactor arrangement but having the GC interfaced with a VG Instruments Spectralab 200 quadrupole mass spectrometer. The primary difference between these runs and those of the standard STO procedure was that the GC-MS runs used 10 mg samples of the catalysts, so that compar- ison with the GC data showed the presence of more unreacted 1-butene in these MS runs. The presence of butane was detected by scanning mass 58 and the various butenes by mass 56, as shown in Fig. 3. Results and discussion The catalysts used in this study were the Pd/MO^ P species described previously [1]. A listing of the specific supports, pendant phosphines and percent Pd is given for each catalyst in Table 1. This previous work showed that the primary factor influencing the liquid phase hydrogenation rates with these catalysts was the nature of the phosphine group attached to the oxide. 11 abed e a b c d e a b c d e Fig. 1. STO chromatograms obtained using Pd/MO^ P catalysts at various temperatures; (A) catalyst I; (B) catalyst II; (C) catalyst III: (a) unreacted 1-butene; (b) butane formed on direct hydrogenation sites; (c) ci's-2-butene; (d) traras-2-butene; (e) butane formed on two-step hydrogenation sites. The nature of the support did not have any significant bearing on the reac- tion. This was not the case when these catalysts were subjected to the STO reaction sequence. The data presented in Figs. 1 and 2, and Table 2 show that the product compositions from these STO reactions, while having some general similarities, are influenced by both the nature of the support and the pendant phosphine, but the metal load and P:Pd ratio appear to have no bearing on these results. The gas chromatographic data from all of these cata- lysts except catalyst VI show that in all cases there were considerable amounts of unreacted 1-butene (peak a) and very small, almost insignificant, amounts of butane formed by direct saturation (peak b). However, the amount of isomeric olefins (peaks c and d) formed varied from catalyst to catalyst, as did the trans/cis 2-butene ratio and the extent of stable metal alkyi formation which is indicated by the amount of butane formed by the second hydrogen pulse (peak e). These phosphinated catalysts have STO 12 abed a b c d e abode Fig. 2.

'Peaks c and d. reaction characteristics markedly different from an unmodified Pd/CPG cata- lyst, but the data do resemble those obtained using a methanol-modified catalyst [4]. The gas chromatographic data for catalyst VI (Fig. 2c) is quite different from the others, in that the low temperature reaction product is composed essentially of one component which is converted into others at higher tem- peratures. GC/MS analysis (Fig. 3) showed that the primary component of this low temperature reaction mixture was butane (mass 58) and the reten- tion time indicated that it was formed by reaction of the second hydrogen pulse with metal alkyl adsorbed on the catalyst. The plot of mass 56 shows the presence of unreacted 1-butene and the isomeric 2-butenes. Catalyst VI is unique in the extent of this stable metal alkyl formation. At higher tem- peratures the metal alkyl is partially dissociated to give the cis- and trans-2- butenes (mass 56) before the introduction of the second hydrogen pulse into the reactor. 14 While catalyst I-V do not show as extensive formation of the stable metal alkyi as does VI, they do show the loss of metal alkyi and increase in isomerization products with increasing temperature (Figs. 1 and 2). GC/ MS analysis was used with these catalysts as well, in order to verify the product identification. These data indicate that the nature of the oxide support influences the amount of isomerization, the cis/trans ratio and the extent of stable surface metal alkyi formation; moreover, with each oxide, the presence of an alkyl- diarylphosphine further enhances the stability of such species. As an extreme example, metal alkyi formation is extensive with the alkyldiarylphosphine silica catalyst, VI, but it is only minimal with the triarylphosphine silica material. III. The extent of isomerization is greater with the silica- and silica/ magnesia-supported catalysts than with the alumina-based ones. It is also increased by the presence of the triarylphosphine groups. For the silica/ magnesia-based catalysts, I and IV, the trans/cis 2-butene ratio is about 2 with the triarylphosphine-containing material, I; it is a little lower than 2 with the alkyldiarylphosphine-containing catalyst, IV. The alumina-based catalysts showed relatively less trans alkene formation, with a trans/cis ratio of 1-1.2 observed with the triarylphosphine present (II) and a ratio of 1.5 - 1.9 with the alkyldiarylphosphine group on the catalyst (V). The triaryl- phosphine silica catalyst. III, has a ratio of about 1.3 but because of the extensive metal alkyi formation observed with the alkyldiarylphosphine silica material, VI, a trans/cis ratio for this material could not be determined. Further work is obviously needed to determine the nature and extent of the apparently complex phosphine-metal-support interaction occurring in these catalysts.
