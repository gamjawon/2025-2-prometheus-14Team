Liquid phase bromination of aromatics over zeolite H-beta catalyst A.P Singh * S.P Mirajkar S Sharma Catalysis Division, National Chemical Laboratory, Pune 411008, India * Corresponding author. Tel.: +91-212-331453; Fax: +91-212-334761; E-mail: apsingh@cata.ncl.res.in The liquid phase bromination of chlorobenzene, toluene and xylenes (o-, m-, p-) is catalyzed using zeolite as catalyst and N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) as the brominating agent. In addition, the bromination of toluene has been investigated over various zeolites using both NBS and liquid Br2 as brominating agents. A comparison under similar reaction conditions with H2SO4, in the absence of catalyst and FeCl3 (in the case of toluene) is also investigated for each reaction. Zeolite H-beta is found to be selective compared to the conventional catalysts and other zeolites in the bromination of chlorobenzene and toluene whereas selectivity for 4-bromo-o-xylene (4-BOX/3-BOX) over H-beta and H2SO4 was found nearly comparable in the bromination of o-xylene. In the bromination of toluene, acidic H-beta favours the formation of nuclear products whereas in the absence of any catalyst, in the presence of weakly acidic H–Y and potassium exchanged zeolites K-beta and K–L, the concentration of side-chain product, œ-bromotoluene, is enhanced. The conversion of NBS, rate of NBS conversion (mmol g−1 h−1) and selectivity for products are strongly influenced by the reaction parameters. As the reaction time, catalyst amount, reaction temperature and molar ratios of NBS/toluene are increased, an increase in the conversion of NBS is noticed. Presumably, the catalytic bromination of aromatics proceeds by an electrophile (Br+) which is generated by the heterolytic cleavage of NBS/Br2 by an acidic zeolite. Thus, the generated Br+ attacks the aromatic ring resulting in the formation of brominated nuclear products. Keywords Bromination of aromatics Zeolite H-beta Bromination of chlorobenzene Toluene Xylenes 1 Introduction Selective bromination of aromatic compounds is investigated in view of the importance of the brominated compounds in organic synthesis [1]. Conventionally, the ring bromination of aromatics is catalyzed by Lewis acids such as the chlorides of aluminum, zinc and iron [2]. Lambert et al. [3]reported on the bromination of benzene and toluene using the NBS–H2SO4–H2O system. This method is unsuitable for the industrial bromination of aromatic compounds due to the need for stoichiometric amount of catalyst, formation of polybrominated products and difficulty in separation of catalyst from the final product. N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) is a radical type reagent used in allylic bromination and in aromatic side-chain bromination, also bromine when applied in daylight to, e.g., toluene, will lead to side-chain bromination. Now sulphuric acid (in the case of NBS) and metal halides (in the case of bromine) are able to turn the reaction to the ionic mechanism, leading to nuclear substitution. Further, the use of zeolite catalysts inhibit the radical reaction and favours the formation of nuclear substituted products by ionic reaction mechanism. Mechanistically, it is believed [4–8]that bromination of aromatics proceeds by the generation of an electrophile (Br+) which is produced by the heterolytic cleavage of NBS/Br2 by an acidic catalyst. Thus, the generated Br+ attacks the aromatic ring resulting in the formation of brominated nuclear products [4–8]. The side-chain or α-bromination of aromatics takes place by a radical mechanism [6, 9, 10]. During the last decade, solid acidic catalysts and in particular, cation-exchange resins in their H+-form have attracted considerable attention due to important advantages over soluble mineral acids [11, 12]. In addition, the bromination of aromatics mediated by silica gel has been reported [1, 13–15]. Zeolites are widely used in the petrochemical industry [16, 17]. More recently, zeolite catalyzed chlorination of aromatic compounds has attracted much interest owing to the simplicity in the use of zeolites and their shape-selective properties [9, 18–24]. However, their use in the bromination of aromatic compounds has been limited [25–34]. In addition, the potential of large pore zeolites like H-beta has not yet been exploited in the bromination of various aromatics. Hence, studies on the catalytic activity of beta zeolites in the bromination of chlorobenzene, toluene and xylenes (o-, m-, p-) with NBS were carried out. The influence of various catalyst modifications, reaction time, brominating agent (NBS/Br2), catalyst concentration, reaction temperature and molar ratios of NBS/toluene was examined on the conversion of NBS, rate of NBS conversion (mmol g−1 h−1) and selectivity for 4-bromotoluene using zeolite H-beta in the bromination of toluene. The results obtained over H-beta were compared with those obtained over conventional catalysts like H2SO4 or FeCl3. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Zeolites ZSM-5, beta and K–L were synthesized according to the literature procedures [35–37]. Organic templates were eliminated from the zeolite channels by calcination in dry air at 823 K for 16 h. To convert ZSM-5 and beta into their protonic forms, the zeolites were exchanged thrice with 1 M NH4NO3 solution at 353 K for 8 h. Zeolites H-mordenite and H–Y were supplied by Laporte Inorganics, Cheshire, UK. 2.2 Characterization The SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratios and degree of ion-exchange of the zeolites were determined by a combination of wet atomic absorption methods (Hitachi 800). The crystallinity and phase purity of the zeolites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using CuKα radiation. The average particle size of the zeolites were determined using Shimadzu (model UV-2101 PC) scanning electron microscope. The surface area of the zeolites was measured by nitrogen BET method using an Omnisorb 100CX apparatus. The properties of the catalysts are listed in Table 1 . Before the reaction, the zeolite samples were dehydrated at 473 K under N2 for 6 h. 2.3 Catalytic reaction experiments The bromination reactions were carried out, in a glass reactor, batchwise. An appropriate amount of catalyst, aromatic substrate (0.021), NBS (0.004 mol) and 1,2-dichloroethane (10 g) were stirred at the required temperature. Product samples were analyzed by a gas-chromatograph (Blue star model 421) fitted with flame ionization detector and a capillary column (50 m×0.2 mm) with methyl silicone gum. Products were identified by GC-MS (Shimadzu-MS QP-2000A) with reference to standard samples. Conversion (and bromine consumption) is reported as the wt.% of NBS consumed. The rate of NBS/Br2 conversion (mmol g−1 h−1) indicates moles of NBS/Br2 converted per gram of catalyst in an hour. 3 Results and discussion Table 1 lists the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, degree of H+-exchange (%), crystal size and surface areas of the various zeolite catalysts used in the bromination reactions. XRD studies indicated high crystallinity and phase purity in all the samples. XRD examination also gave no evidence of structure change of the zeolite sample after various cation exchange. The surface area and scanning electron micrographs revealed well defined materials without any occluded amorphous matter in the zeolites. 3.1 Bromination of toluene 3.1.1 Comparison of various catalysts: bromination with NBS The bromination of toluene with NBS over H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, H-beta, H–Y, conventional catalyst H2SO4 and in the absence of catalyst yielded 2- and 4-bromotoluenes (2-BT and 4-BT,respectively) as the main products and the side-chain brominated α-bromotoluene (α-BT) as the side product. The absence of consecutive products even in the presence of H2SO4 may be attributed to the lower reaction temperature. In addition, strong acid catalyst (H2SO4) does not favour the formation of side-chain halogenated products [18, 20, 31]. The formation of 2- and 4-monobromotoluenes takes place by parallel reactions [21, 31]. Table 2 compares the activities of catalysts under identical reaction conditions. Zeolite H-beta and H2SO4, produced predominantly nuclear brominated products. The blank experiment (no catalyst), zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H–Y produced mainly the side-chain brominated product α-bromotoluene in the bromination of toluene. It is reported that NBS is a reagent which selectively brominates allylic and benzylic positions [10]. However, a number of exceptions have been reported where NBS was shown to brominate nuclear rather than benzylic positions [4, 5]. In addition, the side-chain bromination of toluene in the absence of any catalyst may be attributed to a free radical mechanism [6, 9]. The results in Table 2 indicate that zeolite H-beta is more active and selective (4-BT/2-BT=5.5) for nuclear bromination of toluene compared to other zeolite catalysts. The acidic H–Y gave a higher rate of NBS conversion (3.62 mmol g−1 h−1) for the side-chain product. The conventional catalyst, H2SO4 was found to be more active (rate of NBS conversion=2.68 mmol g−1 h−1) but less selective (4-BT/2-BT=1.3) than H-beta. Among the zeolites H–Y and H-beta, the largest yield of side-chain product (α-BT) was observed over H–Y zeolite. It is reported [9]that silyloxy radicals are produced by the homolytic opening of O3SiOAlO3 structure of zeolites into O3SiO·+O3Al·. These radicals initiate the radical chain reactions. The highest concentration of such centres is expected with aluminum rich zeolites (in H–Y compared to the H-beta) and hence the higher amount of α-BT is observed over H–Y than that of H-beta. 3.1.2 Comparison of various catalysts: bromination of toluene with Br2 Liquid bromine was also employed as the brominating agent instead of NBS in the bromination of toluene. The results of the conversion of bromine, rate of bromine conversion (mmol g−1 h−1), product distribution and isomer ratio (4-BT/2-BT) obtained during bromination of toluene over zeolite H-beta, K-beta and K–L are presented in Table 2. The reaction was also carried out using conventional catalyst, FeCl3, and in the absence of any catalyst for comparison. Zeolite H-beta was found to be the most active (4.11 mmol g−1 h−1) and selective (4-BT/2-BT=4.0) among zeolite catalysts, in the nuclear bromination of toluene. Zeolites K-beta, K–L and the blank experiment (no catalyst) favoured the formation of the side-chain product, α-BT. The higher amount of nuclear product over H-beta compared to K-beta and K–L may be attributed to its acidic nature. The Lewis acid catalyst, FeCl3, was found to be slightly more active (5.38 mmol g−1 h−1) but less selective (4-BT/2-BT=1.1) than H-beta. Zeolite H-beta performed better than the other zeolites and conventional catalysts, H2SO4 and FeCl3, in the bromination of toluene with NBS. The influence of various process parameters on this reaction are discussed, using H-beta, in the following sections. 3.1.3 Influence of reaction time: bromination of toluene with NBS Fig. 1 shows the time-dependence of the conversion of NBS (wt.%) on H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, H-beta, H–Y, H2SO4 and in the absence of catalyst under similar reaction conditions. H-beta showed a lower activity compared to H2SO4. Zeolites H-ZSM-5 and H-mordenite were considerably less active than H-beta in the bromination of toluene. 3.1.4 Influence of reaction time: bromination of toluene with Br2 The results are illustrated in Fig. 2 . The conventional catalyst, FeCl3, was found to be more active than the zeolite catalysts. 3.1.5 Influence of catalyst concentration Fig. 3 shows the effect of concentration of zeolite H-beta on the conversion of NBS, product selectivity and 4-BT/2-BT ratio in the bromination of toluene. The catalyst to NBS ratio was changed by keeping the concentration of NBS constant in the reaction mixture. When the catalyst to NBS ratio was increased from 23.3 to 69.8 g mol−1 of NBS, the conversion of NBS increased from 7.0 to 38.0 wt.%, respectively. Above this ratio the conversion of NBS leveled off. However, the ratio of 4-BT/2-BT is not influenced to a significant extent by the change in catalyst to NBS ratio. œ-Bromotoluene was the main side-chain product in the absence of any catalyst. These results confirm that H-beta catalyzed mainly the ring bromination of toluene. 3.1.6 Influence of reaction temperature The temperature dependence of NBS conversion and product yields in the bromination of toluene is shown in Fig. 4 . The conversion of NBS over H-beta increased steadily from 8.5 to 41.5 wt.% as the temperature was raised from 333 to 353 K. In addition, an increase in the reaction temperature increased the formation of 4-BT and decreased the concentration of 2-BT and side-chain product, α-BT, in the reaction mixture. The isomer ratio (4-BT/2-BT) increased steadily from 1.1 to 5.5 with the increase in reaction temperature from 333 to 353 K, respectively. These results are consistent with the earlier reports [22]. 3.1.7 Influence of toluene/NBS molar ratio The (toluene/NBS) ratios were changed by keeping the amount of toluene constant. The increase in toluene/NBS ratio up to 8 gave a linear rise in the NBS conversion (Fig. 5 ). The conversion of NBS increased from 8.5 to 53.1 wt.% as the toluene/NBS molar ratio increased from 2 to 8. The selectivity for the products was also influenced by the toluene/NBS molar ratio (Fig. 5). 3.2 Bromination of chlorobenzene H-beta was catalytically active also in the bromination of chlorobenzene. The results were compared with those of the conventional catalyst H2SO4. The reaction conditions and the results are summarized in Table 3 . The main products of the reaction were 4-bromo-chlorobenzene (4-BCB) and 2-bromo-chlorobenzene (2-BCB). H-beta is less active than H2SO4. A blank run (without any catalyst) failed to give any conversion of chlorobenzene. 3.3 Bromination of xylenes (o-, m-, p-) over H-beta The bromination of xylenes (o-, m- and p-) was investigated in the presence of 1,2-dichloroethane using zeolite H-beta at 353 K. The conversion of NBS, rate of NBS conversion, product distribution and isomer ratio obtained over H-beta, H2SO4, and in the absence of any catalyst, for all xylenes are included in Table 4 . The bromination of xylenes with NBS over H-beta leads to nuclear as well as side-chain products whereas H2SO4 gave mostly nuclear brominated products. Higher yields of secondary products was also obtained over H2SO4. In the absence of any catalyst, only the side-chain brominated products from the corresponding xylenes were obtained. The bromination of o-xylene over zeolite H-beta leads to the formation of 3-bromo-o-xylene (3-BOX), 4-bromo-o-xylene (4-BOX) and α-bromo-o-xylene. With m-xylene, the reaction gives 5-bromo-m-xylene (5-BMX), 2-bromo-m-xylene (2-BMX), 4-bromo-m-xylene (4-BMX) and α-bromo-m-xylene (α-BMX). Bromination of p-xylene gave monobrominated nuclear product, 2-bromo-p-xylene (2-BPX) and side-chain product, α-bromo-p-xylene. The product ratios of 4-BOX/3-BOX and 4-BMX/2-BMX over H-beta were found to be 5.14 and 2.73, respectively. 4 Conclusions In the liquid phase bromination of toluene using NBS as the brominating agent, zeolite H-beta is more active in the formation of nuclear and para-selective brominated products compared to the other zeolites studied. The higher activity and selectivity may be due to its higher acidity, three dimensional channel structure and large pore openings. The conventional catalyst H2SO4 is more active but poorly para-selective compared to H-beta. Similarly, H-beta is a more para-selective but less active catalyst for the bromination of toluene compared to the conventional catalyst FeCl3 when liquid bromine is used as the brominating agent. In the liquid phase bromination of chlorobenzene, using NBS as the brominating agent, zeolite H-beta is more selective in the production of 4-bromochlorobenzene compared to the conventional catalyst H2SO4. Bromination of xylenes over H-beta gave both nuclear and side-chain brominated products whereas H2SO4 gave mostly the nuclear products. Acknowledgements S.

        "dc:description": "The liquid phase bromination of chlorobenzene, toluene and xylenes (o-, m-, p-) is catalyzed using zeolite as catalyst and N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) as the brominating agent. In addition, the bromination of toluene has been investigated over various zeolites using both NBS and liquid Br2 as brominating agents. A comparison under similar reaction conditions with H2SO4, in the absence of catalyst and FeCl3 (in the case of toluene) is also investigated for each reaction. Zeolite H-beta is found to be selective compared to the conventional catalysts and other zeolites in the bromination of chlorobenzene and toluene whereas selectivity for 4-bromo-o-xylene (4-BOX/3-BOX) over H-beta and H2SO4 was found nearly comparable in the bromination of o-xylene. In the bromination of toluene, acidic H-beta favours the formation of nuclear products whereas in the absence of any catalyst, in the presence of weakly acidic H–Y and potassium exchanged zeolites K-beta and K–L, the concentration of side-chain product, œ-bromotoluene, is enhanced. The conversion of NBS, rate of NBS conversion (mmol g−1 h−1) and selectivity for products are strongly influenced by the reaction parameters. As the reaction time, catalyst amount, reaction temperature and molar ratios of NBS/toluene are increased, an increase in the conversion of NBS is noticed. Presumably, the catalytic bromination of aromatics proceeds by an electrophile (Br+) which is generated by the heterolytic cleavage of NBS/Br2 by an acidic zeolite. Thus, the generated Br+ attacks the aromatic ring resulting in the formation of brominated nuclear products.",
