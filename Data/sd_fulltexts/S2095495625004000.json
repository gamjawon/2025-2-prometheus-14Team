Graphical abstract Cr3+ can form a CrOV structure with VO2 +, preventing VO2 + dehydration due to its strong bonding with H2O and dimerization through site occupancy and charge repulsion, which reduces the risk of precipitation. Vanadium flow batteries (VFB) offer an ideal solution to the issue of storing massive amounts of electricity produced from intermittent renewables. However, the historical challenge of high thermal precipitation of V2O5 from VO2 + (∼50 °C for 1 day) represents a critical concern. Temperature control can alleviate the problem to a certain extent, however, at the expense of the cost of system design and operation. Herein, we report stable electrolyte chemistry at high temperature. By introducing Cr3+ as a stabilizer, it bridges with VO2 + to form a CrOVⅤ structure, which reduces the electron cloud density of V. Therefore, it combines more tightly with H2O and prevents its dehydration process. In addition, the dimerization process of VO2 + is also inhibited due to the occupancy of Cr3+. As a result, a formed 1.5 M VO2 + electrolyte demonstrates a high stability for over 30 days at 50 °C (v.s. blank for < 1 day at 50 °C). Additionally, the low-temperature precipitation temperature of V2+ on the negative side has been reduced from 0 °C of commercial electrolytes to −5 °C. As a proof of concept, a VFB assembled with Nafion 115 membrane demonstrates an energy efficiency (EE) of 80% at 120 mA cm−2 for 1000 cycles (50 °C). Most importantly, a 4 kW stack can continuously run for ∼1000 cycles with EE of 80% at 120 mA cm−2 without any heat management. Combined with high thermal stability and excellent performance, our design will certainly provide new impetus for the further commercialization of VFB batteries. Keywords Vanadium flow battery V2O5 precipitation High temperature stability 1 Introduction Aqueous flow batteries (ARFBs) hold a promise for safe, sustainable, and cost-effective grid energy storage for storing massive amounts of electricity produced from intermittent renewables [1,2]. Among them, the state-of-the-art VFBs received widely attention due to the desired stability, high power density, and separation design of capacity and power [3]. After several decades of development, VFBs have evolved from lab-scale to megawatt-class systems and are currently on the eve of commercialization [4]. Even though, the low thermal stability of positive electrolytes brings high cost of temperature control in the system (<40 °C), even worse, the break of the system under an unpredictable accident. The electrochemical reaction medium in the VFB is vanadium ions in different valence states, with V2+/V3+ for the negative side and VO2 +/VO2+ for the positive side, respectively [5]. For positive, VO2 + suffers from thermodynamic instability, especially when the temperature reaches 50 °C, it tends to precipitate in the form of V2O5 (<10 h), causing the failure of a system [6]. Although current battery systems are generally equipped with a heat exchanger to cool down (<40 °C), refrigeration equipment and operating costs need to be considered. For the decades-long design life of VFB, thermal stability remains a sword of Damocles [7–9]. Therefore, it is urgent to develop more stable electrolytes while weighing high electrochemical kinetics and solubility. A wide temperature window in the field of VFB is worthy of attention [6,9–11]. As reported, the formation process of V2O5 precipitation involves the desolvation and dehydrogenation of VO2 +⋅nH2O followed by the subsequent dimerization process [12,13] (Fig. 1 (a)). Therefore, inhibiting any of these processes is expected to improve the thermal stability of the electrolyte. For example, inhibiting the dehydrogenation process by increasing the concentration of the H2SO4 (Fig. S1) can effectively improve its high temperature stability [14,15]. However, it causes the increase of viscosity [16] and comes at the expense of solubility of negative electrolyte (V2+) due to the common ion effect of SO4 2− [17,18]. In addition, various phosphates [19–22] such as NH4H2PO4, Na3PO4 and Na2HPO4, tend to change the solvation structure of VO2 +, but it can only alleviate the thermal instability to a certain extent (∼7 days). Wang et al. [23] introduced HCl into the electrolyte to compete for the bound H2O of VO2 +. However, chlorine evolution would become a new risk. More studies in this field were listed in Table S1. So far, rare electrolyte composition can meet the long-term stability of VFB electrolyte at high temperatures (50 °C), while maintaining electrochemical kinetic and solubility. What’s worse, there is also a lack of exploration of the electrolyte stability mechanism. The process of V2O5 formation involves the desolvation and dehydrogenation of VO2 + followed by the subsequent dimerization process (Fig. 1(a)). For the de-solvation and dehydrogenation process, this involves the hydration strength between VO2 + and H2O, which is highly correlated with the electron cloud density on V that can be regulated by the interaction with stabilizers. Moreover, combined with stabilizers, the VO2 + dimerization process can also be inhibited due to site occupation and charge repulsion. Therefore, finding stabilizers that can interact strongly with VO2 + is expected to realize high temperature stability. For the VO2 + ion, the oxygen atom in VO2 + can combine with metal ions containing d orbitals in the form of bridges to form a M−O−Vv structure. Theoretical calculation results show that among many transition metal ions, Cr3+ demonstrates the strongest binding ability with VO2 + and are expected to inhibit the desolvation and dimerization issue (Fig. S2). Here, in this manuscript we have developed a high-temperature stable VFB electrolyte (>50 °C) by introducing Cr3+ as stabilizers in the electrolyte. The experimental test results show that the VO2 + electrolyte (∼1.5 M) can remain stable for more than 30 days at 50°C, which is far superior to the stability of pristine electrolytes at 50 ℃ for no more than 10 h and 55 °C for no more than 4 h. What surprises us most is that V2+ in the negative electrolyte does not precipitate at −5 °C, which widens the temperature range of the electrolyte by 20 °C (−5–55 °C v.s. 0–40 °C for commercial electrolyte). The spectral characterization and MD calculation results indicate that Cr3+ demonstrates a strong affinity for VO2 + to form a CrOVV structure in the electrolyte. This structure suppresses the desolvation of hydrated VO2 + to form the VO(OH)3 intermediate. Furthermore, the CrOVV structure can also effectively hinder the sequence dimerization process to precipitate through site occupancy and charge repulsion. As a result, at 50 °C, the assembled battery can operate stably for ∼1000 cycles by using Nafion 115 at 120 mA cm−2 with the energy efficiency (EE) of 80%. Most importantly, a 4 kW stack can also continuously run for over 1000 cycles at 120 mA cm−2 (∼45 °C), demonstrating the reliability and practicality. The above work confirms the possibility of developing VFB electrolytes over a wide temperature range and will become a milestone in the commercialization of VFB. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Design of thermal-stability VFB electrolyte To investigate the thermal stability of VO2 + electrolyte with or without Cr3+, the VO2 + electrolytes with different concentrations of Cr2(SO4)3 at 50 °C were investigated. The purpose of choosing sulfate is to prevent interference from other anions. For the pristine electrolyte 1.5 M VOSO4 + 2.25 M H2SO4 (denoted as 1.5-2.25, the same applies to subsequent abbreviations) without Cr2(SO4)3, the 1.5 M VO2 + electrolyte can be prepared by electrolysis and it can keep stable for no more than 1 days with obvious V2O5 deposition (Fig. 1(b)). Even commercial VO2 + (Dalian BoLong New Materials Co., Ltd.) can only remain stable for about 1 day at 50 °C (Fig. 1(c)). After adding 0.1 M Cr2(SO4)3 or 0.2 M Cr2(SO4)3 (denoted as 1.5-2.25-0.1 Cr2(SO4)3), the stability period of prepared VO2 + can be extended to 2 and 3 days, respectively. But for 0.3 M Cr2(SO4)3 (denoted as 1.5-2.25-0.3 Cr2(SO4)3), the stability period of VO2 + can be extended to more than 40 days without any precipitation (Fig. 1(d)). Even if the temperature was increased to 55 °C, there was no precipitation generation (1.5-2.25-0.3 Cr2(SO4)3) for more than 40 days (Fig. S5). The substantial increase in stability may be due to the fact that when Cr3+ is introduced to a certain concentration, the de-solvation and subsequent dimerization reactions can be inhibited through the interaction with VO2 +. 2.2 Spectroscopic characterization of the stabilization mechanism To investigate the stabilization mechanism, spectroscopic characterizations were conducted to study the structure change of VO2 +. Raman spectra (Fig. 2 (a)) show that with the increase of Cr3+ concentrations, the VO2 + symmetric νss (∼935 cm−1) [24] intensity decreases obviously, which is due to the interaction between Cr3+ and VO2 + bonds that reduces its symmetry. In addition, another vibration signal located at 868 cm−1 appeared and intensified with the concentration of Cr3+. Meanwhile, the peak could not appear in Raman spectra of Cr2(SO4)3 and V(V) under different H2SO4 concentrations (Fig. S6) and there is no change at 800–900 cm−1 adding 0.9 M Na2SO4 to V(V) solution (Fig. S7), which indicates that the signal has no concern with the increase of H2SO4 and SO4 2−. Additionally, by fixing the concentration of Cr2(SO4)3 and varying the VO2 + concentration (Fig. S8), the intensity of the signal (∼868 cm−1) increased with the rise in VO2 + concentration. These results indicate the peak at 868 cm−1 only appears when both VO2 + and Cr3+ are present in the electrolyte and should be attributed to the coordination of Cr3+ and VO2 + (CrOVv), which is equally confirmed by the calculated Raman activity spectrum (Fig. 2(b)). Further increasing the concentration of the VO2 + electrolyte to 2 M, the signal of VV–O VV (∼790 cm−1) [24,25] can be clearly observed (Fig. S9), which indicates the dimerization of V(V). After adding Cr2(SO4)3, this signal disappeared and was replaced by a CrOVV signal at 850 cm−1. Meanwhile, the disappearance of the symmetric vibration of VO2 + located at 935 cm−1 is consistent with the above results. In Fig. 2(c), the vibration at 868 cm−1 does not disappear in the temperature range from room temperature to 70 °C, which suggests the CrOVV structure can be stable at elevated temperature. To further confirm the CrOVV structure, we also conducted UV spectroscopy tests (Fig. S10). The orange line represents the 1.5-2.25-0.3 Cr2(SO4)3 composition. After subtracting the spectra of 1.5-2.25 and 0.3 M Cr2(SO4)3, an additional absorption band appeared (the blue dashed line), which is consistent with the CrOV UV absorption feature reported [26]. Even though the addition of Cr2(SO4)3 can improve the thermal stability of VO2 +, the SO4 2− counterions would significantly increase the concentration of SO4 2−, which has a great impact on the solubility of V2+ on the negative side due to the common effect at low temperature (<0 °C). For example, the introduction of 0.3 M Cr2(SO4)3 would cause the supersaturated precipitation of 1.5 M V2+ below 10 °C, much higher than 0 °C of commercial electrolyte (Fig. 2(d) and Fig. S11(a, b)). Therefore, ensuring the low-temperature stability of the negative electrolyte to realize a wider temperature adaptation is of importance as well. In order to overcome the above issue, we changed the counterions from SO4 2− to PO4 3− to prevent supersaturated precipitation caused by SO4 2−. By introducing different concentrations of CrPO4, we found that 0.3 M CrPO4 can achieve a lifespan of 1.5 M VO2 + for over 30 days at 50 °C (Fig. 2(e)). Even at 55 °C, the VO2 + electrolyte can be stable for 7 days and the negative electrolyte can be guaranteed not to cause supersaturation precipitation at −5 °C, thus greatly widens the temperature adaptability (−5–55 °C vs. 0–40 °C for commercial electrolyte) (Fig. 2(d, e) and Figs. S11–S13). Compared with 0.3 M Cr2(SO4)3, 0.3 M CrPO4 can achieve long-term stability at a lower Cr3+ concentration (Cr3+: 0.6 M vs. 0.3 M). This is mainly because the introduction of SO4 2− will greatly increase the viscosity of the electrolyte, intensify the intermolecular force, and accelerate the precipitation of VO2 +, which is contrary to the inhibitory effect of Cr3+ (Table S2). But PO4 3− has a limited effect on the viscosity of the electrolyte, so a lower concentration of Cr3+ can achieve long-term stability of VO2 +. In actual battery tests, the carbon felt electrode may catalyze the precipitation of VO2 +, due to the abundance of oxygen-containing functional groups on the electrode surface [27] (e.g., CO). To simulate the actual operation environment, carbon felt was introduced into VO2 + electrolyte to test the stability (Figs. S14–S17). The V2O5 has not been observed on the carbon felt soaked in 1.5-2.25-0.3 Cr2(SO4)3 and 1.5-2.25-0.3 CrPO4 for 30 days at 50 °C. However, there is obvious precipitate adhering to carbon felt for the 1.5-2.25 and commercial electrolytes, less than 2 days. The result also shows that Cr3+ is an excellent stabilizer for V(V) electrolyte at high temperature. In the Figs. S18 and S19, there is the same Raman vibration at 868 cm−1 with the addition of CrPO4 as Cr2(SO4)3 and no disappearance with the temperature increasing, indicating the stable CrOVV structure at high temperature. To eliminate the impact of PO4 3− on stability, we added sodium phosphate and phosphoric acid to the electrolyte for comparison. As shown in Fig. 1(e), the results proved that there was no significant improvement in the stability of the electrolyte. 51V nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was also conducted to investigate the change of VO2 + structure with the addition of Cr3+. Fig. 2(f) and Fig. S21 showed higher chemical shifts with increasing Cr3+ concentrations, revealing the decrease in electron density of VO2 + [21,28,29]. The change in the structure of VO2 + was further demonstrated by X-ray absorption near-structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis of V K-edge [30]. The VO2 + electrolyte prepared by 1.5-2.25-0.3 Cr2(SO4)3 and 1.5-2.25-0.3 CrPO4 demonstrates higher edge energy (5475.5 eV vs 5475.0 eV) than the 1.5-2.25 electrolyte in the XANES spectrum (Fig. 2(g)), which indicates that there is lower electron cloud density of V surroundings, consistent with the results of 51V-NMR. In Fig. 2(h), the Fourier transformed EXAFS spectrum was demonstrated, and the R space could be obtained. Compared with 1.5-2.25 pristine electrolyte, the R space of EXAFS reveals the longer bond length of VO, which is a corollary of forming CrOVV bonds. In addition, the increasing bond length of VO (CrOV) and decreasing electron density of V would enhance the coordination strength of VV H2O and then prohibit the desolvation process during the formation of V2O5. 2.3 Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to study the role of Cr2(SO4)3 or CrPO4 stabilizer in VO2 + electrolyte at room and higher temperatures. As Fig. 3 (a) shows, the structure of Cr3+ can be obtained in the snapshots of the VO2 + electrolyte with Cr3+. The VO2 + ions can be found around the Cr3+, which further confirms the formation of the CrOVV structure. Moreover, as the temperature rises, the coordination number of H2O in the VO2 + surroundings reduces in the system (Fig. 3(b)). Consistent tendencies are also shown by the radial distribution function (RDF) around V atoms in Fig. 3(c–e). At 298 K, the peak intensity of H2O around VO2 + shows no significant difference among the three electrolytes. But the electrolytes with Cr3+ demonstrate higher peak intensity than those without Cr3+ at 323 and 373 K. It benefits by decreasing electron density of V in CrOV structure, which retains the surrounding H2O even at elevated temperatures. Meanwhile, because the sites around VO2 + are occupied with Cr3+, the dimerization of VO2 + will be restrained at high temperature, which can be confirmed by the snapshots of three systems under different temperatures shown in Fig. S22. As indicated by the RDF of VV in Fig. 3(f–h), there is more VO2 + at close proximity in the 1.5-2.25 electrolyte at higher temperature, which will lead to a higher frequency of short-distance collisions and then dimerization to produce V2O5. The above results suggest that the addition of Cr3+ greatly reduces the dimerization of VO2 + at high temperatures, which effectively confines the formation of V2O5. 2.4 Battery performance To verify the impact of Cr3+ on electrochemical performance, cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were conducted in a diluted electrolyte of 0.05 M VO2 +, 0.05 M VO2+, with or without 0.3 M CrPO4 and 0.3 M Cr2(SO4)3 (Fig. 4 (a)). Compared to the pristine electrolyte, the electrolyte containing CrPO4 exhibited higher peak currents and smaller oxidation–reduction potential gap, indicating that CrPO4 has a significant positive effect on the electrochemical kinetics of VO2 +/VO2+. The reduction in charge transfer resistance (2.46 Ω of 0.3 M CrPO4 v.s. 5.87 Ω of blank) further confirmed this result (Fig. S23 and Table S4). However, after the addition of Cr2(SO4)3, the peak current decreased, and the charge transfer resistance increased to 7.65 Ω, possibly due to the high concentration of SO4 2−, increasing the viscosity of the electrolyte. Thus, from the perspective of the electrochemical kinetics of VO2 +/VO2+, the performance of CrPO4 is superior. To further investigate the effect of Cr3+ on VO2 +/VO2 + kinetics, electrochemical experiments were conducted in a 0.75 M VO2 + + 0.75 M VO2 + electrolyte, with or without 0.3 M Cr2(SO4)3 and 0.3 M CrPO4 (Fig. S24). In contrast to the results from the low-concentration tests, a decrease in peak current was observed after the addition of CrPO4. Although the charge transfer resistance decreased (0.013 Ω of 0.3 M CrPO4 v.s. 0.028 Ω of blank), the increased ohmic resistance of 0.12 Ω caused by the higher sulfate concentration may have a slight negative effect on the electrochemical kinetics of VO2 +/VO2 + (Table S5). A slight shift in peak potential indicates that the addition of Cr3+ has altered the surrounding environment of V(V), and this effect is more pronounced at higher vanadium concentrations. For V2+/V3+, Cr3+ does not participate in the electrochemical reaction and exerts a slight negative effect on the electrochemical kinetics, as evidenced by a decrease in peak current and an increase in the oxidation–reduction potential gap (Figs. S25 and S26). Furthermore, EIS tests (Figs. S25 and S26) confirm that the presence of Cr3+ leads to an increase in charge transfer resistance (Tables S6 and S7). At higher vanadium concentrations, the addition of Cr3+ also increases the ohmic resistance (Table S7). This ultimately results in an inevitable loss of electrochemical performance for V2+/V3+. VFB batteries were assembled to test the effect of Cr3+ on battery performance. To avoid the crossover of Cr3+ that leads to a concentration imbalance on both sides, Cr3+ salt is introduced to positive and negative electrolytes at the same concentration. Fig. 4(b) shows the battery efficiency of different electrolytes under 50 °C at the current density of 80 mA cm−2. The voltage efficiency (VE) of the electrolyte with Cr2(SO4)3 (1.5-2.25-0.3 Cr2(SO4)3) appears a decrease by 4% compared with that of pristine and commercial electrolytes (91.2% and 91.5% to 87.5%). This should be attributed to the addition of Cr2(SO4)3, which increases the electrolyte viscosity and decreases the ion conductivity (Tables S2 and S3). By contrast, with the additive CrPO4 (1.5-2.25-0.3 CrPO4), the electrolyte demonstrates similar ion conductivity as the pristine electrolyte, which keeps VE above 90% and energy efficiency (EE) of 84.1% comparable to that of the commercial electrolyte (Fig. 4(b)). The charge–discharge curves are shown in Figs. S27–S30. With the addition of Cr3+, the overpotential increases slightly. However, for the battery capacity (Fig. S31), at a current density of 80 mA cm−2, it is still able to achieve 84.5% (v.s. 87.9% of 1.5-2.25) of the theoretical capacity. Even at a current density of 160 mA cm−2, the flow battery with 1.5-2.25-0.3CrPO4 can still reach 75% of the theoretical capacity. Fig. 4(c) presents the battery performance of a single cell (48 cm2) assembled with 1.5-2.25-0.3 CrPO4, 1.5-2.25, and commercial electrolyte (60 mL) at the current density from 40 to 200 mA cm−2 at 50 °C. Even at 200 mA cm−2, the 1.5-2.25-0.3 CrPO4 electrolyte demonstrates energy efficiency of 75.2%, nearly equal to the 1.5-2.25 (75.4%) and slightly lower than commercial electrolyte (77.2%). Fig. 4(d) and Fig. S33 show the cycle performance of commercial electrolyte and 1.5-2.25-0.3 CrPO4 at 50 °C. The commercial electrolyte suffers from faster capacity decay after 50 cycles, which is caused by V2O5 precipitation from the commercial electrolyte at high temperature. When batteries assembled with commercial electrolyte were taken apart, the carbon felt was covered by reddish brown precipitation. As shown in Fig. 4(d), the 1.5-2.25-0.3 CrPO4 exhibits stable cycling performance more than 1000 cycles at 120 mA cm−2, keeping the average EE above 80%, and there is no V2O5 precipitation observed. At the same time, the cycle performance of 1.5-2.25-0.3 CrPO4 at room temperature and 0 °C is also stable (Fig. S35). The results show that the advantages of VFB are retained, and high-temperature stability is improved at the same time. To further verify the practicality of the designed electrolyte, we assembled and tested a 4 kW-class battery stack, which was composed of 25 single cells of 1056 cm2 connected in series with 45 L of electrolyte (Fig. 4(e)). We removed the heat exchange system, and the operating temperature of the stack was maintained at about 45–48 °C (Fig. S36). Actual test results show that the stack can operate stably for ∼1000 cycles at 120 mA cm−2, with energy efficiency maintained at ∼80% (Fig. 4(f, g)). According to the above results, we have verified the feasibility of our design of high-temperature stable electrolyte from theoretical and practical tests, which will be critical for the further commercialization of VFB. 3 Conclusions In summary, we developed a new type of high-temperature stable VFB electrolyte. Cr3+ was introduced as a stabilizer to form a CrOVV structure bridging with VO2 +. This structure reduces the electron cloud density on V and binds more tightly to H2O, thereby preventing its dehydration to form VO(OH)3 precipitation precursors. In addition, due to the occupation of Cr3+, the dimerization process of VO2 + is also suppressed, further reducing the risk of generating V2O5 precipitation. As a result, the 1.5 M VO2 + electrolyte exhibits super stability for more than 30 days at 50 °C and can maintain stability for 7 days even at 55 °C. Most importantly, it can take into account the low-temperature stability of the negative electrolyte to ensure that V2+ will not saturate and precipitate at −5 °C. In terms of performance, at 50 °C, the EE of the battery assembled with Nafion 115 membrane exceeds 80% at 120 mA cm−2 by using the designed electrolyte. In addition, the assembled 4 kW stack can continuously run for nearly 1000 cycles at 50 °C with an EE of 80% at 120 mA cm−2, which proves its practicality and reliability. Combined with excellent high and low temperature stability and electrochemical kinetics, our design will surely provide new opportunities for the further commercialization of VFB batteries.

        "dc:description": "Vanadium flow batteries (VFB) offer an ideal solution to the issue of storing massive amounts of electricity produced from intermittent renewables. However, the historical challenge of high thermal precipitation of V2O5 from VO2 + (∼50 °C for 1 day) represents a critical concern. Temperature control can alleviate the problem to a certain extent, however, at the expense of the cost of system design and operation. Herein, we report stable electrolyte chemistry at high temperature. By introducing Cr3+ as a stabilizer, it bridges with VO2 + to form a CrOVⅤ structure, which reduces the electron cloud density of V. Therefore, it combines more tightly with H2O and prevents its dehydration process. In addition, the dimerization process of VO2 + is also inhibited due to the occupancy of Cr3+. As a result, a formed 1.5 M VO2 + electrolyte demonstrates a high stability for over 30 days at 50 °C (v.s. blank for < 1 day at 50 °C). Additionally, the low-temperature precipitation temperature of V2+ on the negative side has been reduced from 0 °C of commercial electrolytes to −5 °C. As a proof of concept, a VFB assembled with Nafion 115 membrane demonstrates an energy efficiency (EE) of 80% at 120 mA cm−2 for 1000 cycles (50 °C). Most importantly, a 4 kW stack can continuously run for ∼1000 cycles with EE of 80% at 120 mA cm−2 without any heat management. Combined with high thermal stability and excellent performance, our design will certainly provide new impetus for the further commercialization of VFB batteries.",
