Box, 55-534 Mexico 09340 D.F. (Mexico) (Received December 23,1988; revised March 6,1989) Summary Gas phase hydrogenation of o-xylene over palladium supported cat- alysts was studied. Catalysts were characterized by hydrogen and carbon monoxide chemisorption and hydrogen-oxygen titrations. The supports used were silica, y-alumina and silica-alumina. The products of the reaction were cis- and (rans-l,2-dimethylcyclohexane and -1,2-dimethylcyclohexene. The selectivity was modified by temperature, metal dispersion, and acidity of the support, the production of the trans isomer increasing with an increase in each of these three factors. On the contrary, the presence of electron-donor molecules, such as pyridine, increased the selectivity to the cis isomer. The production offr-ares-l,2-dimethylcyclohexane may be adequately explained by the 'roll-over' of the intermediate species. It is proposed that the electron density of palladium is the determinant factor for the stereoselectivity of the catalysts. Introduction The first studies concerning the catalytic hydrogenation of substituted benzenes appeared in the early 1950s. These works were particularly devoted to the study of the stereochemistry of the reaction, seeking information regarding the mechanism of hydrogenation. The Horiuti-Polanyi mechan- ism, applied to the hydrogenation of an aromatic ring, is in good agreement with the observed kinetic orders of reaction with respect to the aromatic and hydrogen concentrations (0.0 and 0.5, respectively) under mild conditions. According to this mechanism, the addition of the six hydrogen atoms to the ring from the catalytic surface is expected. Therefore the cis isomers obtained from xylenes or their tetrahydro derivatives are readily understood. However, the production of the (rores-dimethylcyclohexanes are not predicted by this mechanism, unless the isomerization of one double bond is con- sidered. In fact, Siegel and Dunkel [1] have observed similar products from the hydrogenation of xylenes and related cyclohexenes over Pt catalysts. Siegel et al., [2] suggested that the cycloalkenes formed from the cis addition of four hydrogen atoms to the xylene molecule were released from the surface 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 108 before final readsorption and reduction, leading to the formation of the trans isomers. Alkenes are indeed released from the catalyst surface during hydrogenation [3,4]. However, in order to account for the stereochemistry observed, more than 50% of the aromatic hydrocarbon should be reduced via the desorbed cyclohexenes, whereas it has been shown that this fraction is small [3]. In this sense, Hartog et al. [5] concluded that in the hydrogenation of benzene over Ru, only 1% of the benzene that is hydrogenated leaves the surface as cyclohexene, the remainder being hydrogenated during one sojourn on the surface. Siegel [6] has pointed out that if this is so, there must be a mechanism whereby a xylene molecule may be converted to a (rans-dimethylcyclohexane without leaving the surface. It is important to note that all of the literature cited above deals with the hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds in the liquid phase. In addition, little attention has been given to the condition or history of the catalyst. As a result, no correlation has been made between the stereochemistry of the hydrogenation reactions and the metal dispersion or type of support material. In this work a study of the stereochemistry of the hydrogen addition to o-xylene with Pd catalysts supported on silica (low and high dispersion), alumina, and silica-13.2% alumina is presented in order to examine if the particle size and/or the type of support may have any influence upon the stereoselectivity of palladium. Palladium has been shown to produce considerable amounts of trans- 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane [7,8], as opposed to Ni, Pt or Rh which are much more selective to the formation of the cis isomer [9-11]. Experimental Catalysts were prepared by a classical impregnation method with a fresh solution of PdCla^HaO (K and K ICN Pharmaceutical Inc., New York) in the required amounts to give a metal content of 2 wt% with respect to the support. The supports used were silica F-2 (180 n^g\"^, Akzo Chemie); y-alumina GFSC-54 (190 n^g\"1, Rhone Poulenc); and silica-13.2% alumina (200 m2 g~1, Akzo Chemie). All of the carriers were previously calcined under flowing air at 723 K for 12 h. After impregnation, the resulting materials were dried overnight in air at 383 K. Reduction of the metallic precursor was carried out under flowing hydrogen at 573 K during 4h. The catalysts prepared by this method were stored in bottles until used. Metal dispersions, denned as the ratio of surface atoms to total metal atoms in the catalyst, were obtained from hydrogen chemisorption at 343 K. In addition, CO chemisorption and hydrogen oxygen titrations were also studied. Hg and CO adsorptions were performed in a glass volumetric adsorption system, and hydrogen-oxygen titrations in a microbalance. Hg and CO uptakes were obtained by extrapolating the adsorption isotherms to zero pressure. 109 The rate of o-xylene hydrogenation was measured in a flow reactor at low conversions coupled to a gas chromatograph for analysis of the reaction mixture. The reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure, and the partial pressure of o-xylene was 3.7torr (488.4 Pa). In order to obtain the apparent activation energy, the temperature of the reaction was varied between 363 and 433 K, first in an increasing sequence, and then in a decreasing sequence. The activity measurements at a given temperature were registered for a period of 30min. Between each temperature, the catalyst was maintained under pure hydrogen flow. The hydrogenation reaction was also performed in the presence of pyridine or thiophene (5 40 ppm), which was added to the reactor simultan- eously with the o-xylene. Before any chemisorption or activity measurements were done, the catalysts were reactivated under flowing hydrogen at the reduction tempera- ture for 2 h. In the case of the adsorption experiments, the samples were maintained under a vacuum of at least lO^torr at 573 K for 2h before cooling to the chemisorption temperature. Results Hydrogen and carbon monoxide chemisorption, expressed as hydrogen atoms or CO molecules adsorbed per Pd atom (H/Pd and CO/Pd, respectively), and hydrogen-oxygen titrations (0/Pd) are listed in Table 1. The stoichiometry used to compute the oxygen adsorbed from hydrogen- oxygen titrations was that reported by Benson and Boudart [12]. In all of the cases studied, the metal dispersion obtained from hydrogen chemisorption (H/Pd) was slightly higher than that obtained from hydrogen-oxygen titrations (0/Pd). The small difference between both methods may be due to 'weakly adsorbed' hydrogen, which is removed in the gravimetric system before oxygen is admitted to the adsorption cell. The CO/H ratio confirmed the preference of Pd for bridge bonded CO species. The mean crystallite size for the 2 wt.% Pd catalysts was in the range 2.9-6.6 nm (computed from the H/Pd ratio), therefore dispersion effects in these TABLE 1 Hydrogen and carbon monoxide adsorptions, and hydrogen-oxygen titrations for palladium catalysts at 343 K Catalyst Pd Support H/M 0/M CO/M CO/H dn\" (wt.%) (nm) Pd2/S 2.0 SiC>2 0.29 0.19 0.09 0.32 6.6 Pd0.5/S 0.5 SiOz 0.87 0.82 0.49 0.56 1.2 Pd2/A 2.0 ALjOa 0.37 0.14 0.18 0.48 2.9 Pd2/S-A 2.0 SiO^-AlzOg 0.24 0.18 4.4 a Mean particle size on a hydrogen chemisorption basis. 110 TABLE 2 Activity, selectivity and apparent energy of activation of palladium catalysts in the hydrogenation ofo-xylene at 413 K Catalyst TOF x 103 Selectivity Activation energy (molec/site/s) (kJmol\"1) %St %Sc %S, H/Pd 0/Pd ^ E^ Pd2/S 5.04 7.68 52 43 4 48.1 37.6 10.0 PdO.S/S 7.94 8.48 57 39 4 50.1 45.9 25.1 Pd2/A 3.82 9.86 60 36 4 54.3 45.6 14.6 Pd2/S-A 11.9 15.9 64 34 2 41.4 39.7 28.4 catalysts are expected to be small. The catalyst with 0.5 wt.% Pd presented a higher metal dispersion (0.87), which corresponds to a mean particle size of 1.2 nm. Under the experimental conditions employed, a zero reaction order in o-xylene was observed. Turnover frequencies (TOF), defined as molecules ofo-xylene converted per site and per second, the stereoselectivity of Pd, and the apparent activation energies for each one of the products are listed in Table 2. The stereoselectivity was defined as: S,= ri xlOO fc + rt + 7a where r, is the rate of formation of the tth product and the c> ti and a subscripts stand for cis- and (rares-2-dimethylcyclohexanes and -1,2- dimethylcyclohexene, respectively. The values of TOF that appear in the first column were computed using the hydrogen chemisorption as a basis, while the values in the second column were calculated with the hydrogen oxygen titration data. In all cases, the silica-alumina-supported catalyst showed the highest activity, although the difference in activities was not larger than a factor of three. The fraras-l,2-dimethylcyclohexane (f-DMCH) produced for each cat- alyst the highest value of apparent activation energy, followed by the cis isomer. The alkene that desorbed from the metal surface was the product formed with the lowest value of activation energy. It is worth pointing out that no appreciable deactivation was observed during the activity measure- ments, neither at a given temperature nor in the sequences of increasing- decreasing temperature. It may be noted from the selectivity values in Table 2 that, regardless of the support, the trans isomer was the most favoured product. However, differences in the selectivity patterns are observed when comparing the various catalysts. Firstly, the selectivity to the trans isomer (Si) increased with increasing dispersion on the same support (silica), alghough no modification in the production of the alkene (1,2-dimethylcyclohexene) was Ill TABLE 3 Activity and selectivity of palladium catalysts in the hydrogenation ofo-xylene at 413 K in the presence ofthiophene or pyridine Catalyst Thiophenf (ppm) a Pyridine (ppm) TOP x 103 (molec/site/ Selecti's) vity %St %Se %S, Pd2/S S 12.4 45 52 3 Pd2/S 20 40 52 7 Pd2/A 5 3.09 47 49 4 Pd2/S-A 10 7.23 54 44 2 Pd2/S 20 45 47 8 Pd2/S-A 20 61 36 3 observed. It is important to note that these two catalysts (low and high dispersion) showed comparable activities. Secondly, the production of the trans isomer was enhanced by the acidity of the support, i.e. Si increased following the order SiOg < AlgOs < SiOa-AlgOa, considering that dispersion effects in these catalysts should most likely be small. On the other hand, the S^ increased with increasing temperature for all of the catalysts. This behaviour is the result of the apparent activation energies of product species calculated from the Arrhenius plots. Experiments were performed in the presence of thiophene or pyridine in the reactant mixture at 413 K, in order to study the effect of these molecules over the stereoselectivity of Pd. The results obtained are reported in Table 3. It may be observed that a concentration of thiophene as low as 5 ppm readily altered the product distribution, increasing the selectivity to the cis isomer. At this concentration of thiophene the total activity remained the same, within the experimental error, as in its absence. At higher concentrations (10 or 20 ppm) thiophene began to act as a poison, causing a decrease in the activity of Pd with time. However, the increased selectivity to cis isomer seen at the low concentration was still observed. It also may be noted that the same chemical behaviour of palladium was induced by both thiophene and pyridine molecules. Discussion The increase in selectivity to f-DMCH with increases in both tempera- ture and dispersion indicates that the 'roll-over' model may be a good approximation of the mechanism by which the trans isomer is produced. This reaction model was first proposed by Inoue et al., [13] to explain the exchange of hydrogen atoms on both sides of the cyclopentane molecule over Pd catalysts. These authors observed that the complete exchange of cyclopen- tane (Dio) was enhanced by increases in both temperature of reaction and metal dispersion, and also that, of all the product species, the energy of 112 Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the 'roll-over' model explaining the production of turns - isomer [131. activation attained the highest value for the formation of the completely exchanged cyclopentane. If this model of reaction applies to the hydrogenation of o-xylene, then the last double bond to be hydrogenated (most probably 1,2-dimethylcyclo- hexene) must isomerize before the roll-over step is achieved in order to produce the trans isomer (see Fig. 1). Since the 1,2-isomer is stabler than the 2,3-isomer, the latter must have to be much more reactive than the former to account for the <-DMCH formed. Indeed, the 2,3-isomers have been shown to be selectively reduced in the presence of their precursors [10,14]. It is important to note that the 'roll-over' model does not imply a desorption-readsorption step for the intermediate species. The catalytic hydrogenation of o-xylene may be considered a typical kinetically controlled process, since thermodynamics predicts a selectivity to trans isomer greater than 80% (at 413 K). Taking into account the extra steps that are involved in the production of the trans isomer, and that this product is thermodynamically favoured, the longer the o-xylene molecule (or the intermediate species) is allowed to remain on the surface, the closer the selectivity value will be to that predicted by thermodynamics. Following this logic and recalling that o-xylene, like benzene or acetylene, acts as a Lewis base toward the metal [15], it would be expected that o-xylene, as well as the intermediate species, should be more strongly bonded to electrophilic palladium (or more weakly bonded to electron-rich Pd atoms) than to an unmodified palladium surface. This fact would then be determinant in the stereoselectivity of the palladium catalysts. In the previous section, enhanced stereoselectivity to (-DMCH was observed with increases in both Pd dispersion and acidity of the support. The effect of dispersion, especially considering the fact that the activity did not decrease with dispersion, may be explained in terms of the different electronic structures of small metal particles. The electronic structure of transition metals gradually changes as the number of atoms in the particle decreases. For Pt, it has been shown that the v(NO) frequency increases with dispersion [16,17]. These results were explained by an intrinsic change in electronic properties with particle size. The catalytic behaviour of highly dispersed palladium catalysts in the hydrogenation ofbutyne and butene was 113 explained by the higher coordinative unsaturation of small metal particles, which, for that very reason, coordinate more strongly with unsaturated hydrocarbons [18]. Moreover, by using molecular orbital calculations, Baet- zold [19] has shown that a decrease in the particle size of palladium clusters is accompanied by a decrease in the d occupation and density of states at the Fermi level. If the electronic occupation in the valence band is less in small metal clusters, then the binding energy of electron-donor adsorbed species should be higher [20]. We think that this effect may be important in explaining the higher production of (-DMCH that we observed for the highly dispersed Pd on silica catalyst. The effect of the acidity of the support may be explained in terms of the electrophilic character of palladium on the carriers employed, which should increase in the order: SiOg < AlgOs < SiOg-AlaOs [21]. The selectivity to f-DMCH was observed to follow this order. Although the effect of acidic supports on the catalytic properties of transition metals is still controversial [22], there is some evidence which supports the idea that it could be electronic in nature [23-26]. The possibility that reaction may also occur at the periphery of metal particles by cooperation between adjacent metal and support sites should be considered [27,28]. This would be a reasonable explanation for the increase in activity observed on the silica-alumina supported catalyst, as has also been observed in the hydrogenation of benzene with palladium catalysts [21,29]. However, these new sites should adsorb the o-xylene and the intermediate species more strongly than the unmodified or typical palladium-on-silica active sites, in order to produce more (-DMCH. The experiments performed in the presence of pyridine or thiophene have shown that the influence of these molecules may be compared to the effect of piperidine on Pd [30] or to the behaviour shown by Ni promoted by an electron donor species [31], which were related to an increase in the electron density of the Pd or Ni particles respectively. It appears that thiophene and pyridine act as electron donor species, increasing the electron density of the palladium active sites, with a concomitant decrease in the relative heats of adsorption of the reactive species on the Pd surface. If we consider the size of the thiophene (pyridine) molecule, was well as the fact that no hydrogenolysis products were observed, then we may suggest that the effect induced by this molecule is of long range character rather than local. This proposal would explain why at low concentrations of thiophene the activity did not decrease but the selectivity of the active sites was changed. Conclusions The principal conclusions of this work are: (1) The production of (rares-l,2-dimethylcyclohexane may be explained by a 'roll-over' of the adsorbed species on the palladium surface. (2) The stereoselectivity of palladium is altered by the metal disper- sion, the acidity of the support, and the presence of electron donor molecules 114 such as pyridine and thiophene, in other words, by the electron density of the palladium surface atoms (or the active sites, in the case of the acidic supports).

The selectivity was modified by temperature, metal dispersion, and acidity of the support, the production of the trans isomer increasing with an increase in each of these three factors. On the contrary, the presence of electron-donor molecules, such as pyridine, increased the selectivity to the cis isomer. The production off trans-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane may be adequately explained by the ‘roll-over’ of the intermediate species. It is proposed that the electron density of palladium is the determinant factor for the stereoselectivity of the catalysts. References 1 S. Siegel M. Dunkel Adv. Catal. 9 1957 51 2 S. Siegel G.V.
