A tungsten hydride species is suggested as an intermediate in the catalytic cycle. Introduction The inertness of cyclohexene (CHE) towards ring-opening polymerization in the presence of typical metathesis catalysts has been known and confirmed by a number of authors f 1 ] - It has been explained in terms of the thermodynamic equilibrium which very strongly favors the monomer. However, cyclohexene is not totally inactive- Crain [ 2] claims that he succeeded in polymerizing CHE although with very poor yields. In this paper we report the study of reactions of CHE in the presence of typical metathesis catalysts: WC16 + ROH + EtAICI2 (R = Et, Ph, PhCH2). Experimental Reagents were prepared under purified argon. Cyclohexene (CHE) was distilled from benzophenone ketyl. Pure WC16 was obtained by sublimation or the more volatile oxychlorides at 120 C, 2 mmHg, and was used as 0.1 M solutions in chlorobenzene (PhCl). EtAlCI, was synthesised according to ref. 3 and distilled. AIC13 was purified by sublimation. PhCl was dried over P205 and distilled. Ethanol was distilled from magnesium ethanolate, benzyl alcohol and phenol were distilled from sodium alcoholates. The reactions were carried out under purified argon or hydrogen in a 100 cm-3 three-necked flask, equipped with a thermometer, stirrer and condenser and situated in an oil bath.- Transfers of chemical reagents were done by hypodermic syringes. Ire a typical experiment 0.284 g (0.72 mM) of WCIg in PhCl was added to a mixture of 20 cm-3 (153_7 mM) of CHE and 350 14 cm 3 of PhCI and allowed ;,o react with 0.72 mM of an appropriate alcohol (coiour change Lrom dark brown to deep red). Finally, 0.364 g (2.8 7 mM) of EtAIC12 were injected into the reaction mixture causing a fine, black precipitate to form. The molar ratios were: olefin:W: Al = 250:1:4-, ofelin: solvent = 1:1 vol. The reaction mixture was stirred at 70 'C for 24 h and quenched with diluted HCl_ The organic layer was subjected to distillation: PhC1 and CHE were removed under reduced pressure- The honey-like yellowish residue was analysed by means of gas chromatography on Silicone Oss%17 390 on a Diatomite CQ column at 209 C using n-dodecane as an internal standard. The products were identified by means of mass spectral analyses performed with a 6 CMR LKB 2091 GC-MS apparatus. The molecular weight measurements were carried out osmometrically with a Hewlett Packard Model 302 B instrument in benzene at room temperature. The dimer fraction was distilled under reduced pressure (2 mmHg, b.p. 80 - 120 C). Its main component, dicyciohexyl was isolated by preparative gas chromatography with a Varian Gas Chromategraph Model 2868 on an FFAP column at 120 C. The spectral data of dicyclohexyl: i.r. (Perkin Elmer Model 577): 2930s, 2860s, 1450m, 1345w, 1257w, 990w, 895w, 790w. 1H n.m.r. (JIVM-100H Jeol Tokyo): 0.82 ppm (12H), 1_32 ppm (10H) (; ). Hydrogenation of the dimeric fraction, was performed with 5 - 10% by weight of Pt02 by bubbling hydrogen though the stirred reaction mixture (room temp., 24 h)_ Results and discussion TABLE 1 Oligomerization of cyclohegene Solvent - PhCl, molar ratio CHE:W:Al = 250:1:4, CHE:PhCl = 1 :1 by vol., 70 C, 24 li Run Catalyst Atmosphere Conversion wo) 1 WC16 + EtAIC12 Ar 30_9 2 EtAICl, Ar 12_5 3 A1C13 Ar 12.7 4 AIC13 H2 13.0 5 WC16 Ar 0 Under the conditions studied, 25 - 7090 of CHE, depending on the catalytic system, is converted to oligomers (Tables 1, 2)_ As only the dOeric fraction could be obtained by distillation, the identification of higher oligomers was based on joint G.C.-M.S. analysis. The fragmentation of nearly all compounds in the reaction mixture is characterised by the subsequent loss of cyclohexyl units as the most abundant ions with m/e 81 or 82- This proves that six-membered rings are preserved in the reaction products.

Dicyclohexyl was often accompanied by its unsaturated analogue: cyclohexenylcyclohexane (M.W. 164)_ This was proved also by hydrogenation of the dimeric fraction which gave only dicyclohexyl_ The dimer fraction also contained minor amounts (up to 2%) of the products of alkylation of chlorobenzene with cyclohexene. The mass spectra of the components of the trimer fraction prove the exist:-_nce of three-unit oligomers: fully saturated of M.W. 248 (three isomers), mono -unsaturated of M .W. 246 (at least two isomers) and with one aromatic ring of M_W_ 242_ The aromaticity is confirmed by the abundant parent ion and also by abundant m/e 91. Similarly to the dimer fraction, which often contained only dicyclohexyl, the main components of the trimers were saturated compounds of M.W. 248_ They are unable to undergo further transformations and accumulate in the reaction mixture. The calculated molecular weight of the higher fractions gives averages of 4 - 5 unit oligomers (Table 2)_ i he identified products suggest that the reaction is not a metathesis type process, although proceeding in the presence of a typical olefin metathesis catalyst- The metathesis catalysed by WC16-based systems has been shown to be accompanied by side reactions such as dimerization of the olefin [41 or the alkylation of the aromatic solvent by the olefin [5] . In the alkylation of the aromatic solvent, for example, the activity of the system WC16 + EtAlC12 has been shown to be similar to that of AlC13 [5b; _ To clarify the role of the transition metal in CHE transformations the reactions were performed with EtAIC12 and AIC13 alone (Table 1, runs 1 - 3)_ In fact, these Lewis acids catalyse the above described transformations of CHE, but their activity (relative LHE conversion as compared with the system WC16 + EtAlCi=) is only about 4090_ Tungsten hexachloride does not catalyse the reaction (Table 1, run 5)_ The oligornerization of CHE in the presence of alu ninium chloride and ethyl aluminiumdichloride must be a cationic process comprising an attack of the aluminium compound on the sp2 carbon atom of CHE or an electron transfer process from CHE to the aluminium compound- Tungsten species, especially in a high oxidation state, may act themselves as electrophiles or may facilitate the electron transfer. Menapace [4] , however, suggested that the reduced tungsten (III or Ill) hydride species participated in the olefin dimerization processes. For HCE a similar catalytic cycle can be envisaged according to Scheme 1. The composition of the products suggests not only simple oligomerzzation processes- The presence on the one hand of saturated, and on the other of aromatic compounds, must be due to intermolecular hydrogen exchange processes. Hydrogen migrations have already been observed for the catalysts derived from WC16, namely, as double bond migrations in linear olefins [61 _ These reactions are commonly attributed to the hydride species catalysisIn order to gain a better insight into the problem some reactions were performed in hydrogen atmosphere (Table 2, runs 7, 9, 11). The conversion of 353 ~i,a ~\"`a neteuelz rwduction and aiky(aliun. H EtAIC, ,If,\" o ~~' H 'r W dc-'. ~~? W Scheme 1 _ CHE was higher in all these systems as compared with the analogues in argon atmosphere (Table 2, runs 6, 8, 10). The reaction mixture contains relatively more of the lower fractions, and as these consist mainly of saturated compounds it reveals the hydrogenation reaction also taking place. At the same time, tire degree of oligomerization of higher fractions is usually higher than in argon (see N in Table 2). All these phenomena can be explained in terms of enhancing the hydrogen transfer processes via the formation of tungsten hydride complexes. The participation of tungsten hydride is also corifrrmed by the fact that molecule= hydrogen does not activate the AIC13 catalysed reaction (Table 1, run 4). Finally, different alcohols were used as modifiers of the catalyst (Table 2)_ Both benzyl alcohol and phenol modified systems exhibit higher activity than the ethanol system. The reaction not only proceeds faster, but also oligomerization goes further, which is indicated by the higher molecular weight of the product (Table 2, runs 8 - 11). This effect may O attributed to the stabilizing properties of -OPh and -OCF-12gh ligands, as the interaction of WC], with ROH yields W(OR)Cls _ However, the possibility of the formation of a hydride species via activation of aromatic or Onzylic hydrogens in the presence of the transition metal compound should also be considered [7]_ Conclusions Cyclohexene in the presence of the typical meta+hesis catalysts WCIG + ROH f EtAIC12 undergoes complex transfor=mations according to Scheme 2. These transformations are considered to be catalysed by tungsten hydride species, e.g., according to Scheme 1, which is suggested by the influence of molecular hydrogen and of modifying alcohol on the system- 354 MW 164 1&WO 10 += itI O-S :.~ 0 - 0 b W 7 2 ~ 7/.1K 746 MW 248 !Ctremars Scheme 2.
