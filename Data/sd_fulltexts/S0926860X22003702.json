High-performance, stable and inexpensive catalysts use for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process are indispensable in the cathode and play an important role in the practical application and industrialization of metal air batteries. In recent years, highly efficient and stable nonprecious metal catalysts have been the focus of research, and cobalt and cobalt oxides being promising options. Herein, we propose a one-step mixed impregnation method to prepare a nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst, after heat treatment the Co-anchored to N-doped carbon catalyst (Co-N-C) with 10–30 nm of Co uniformly distributed was obtained. Which find that 5% Co loading is enough to obtain excellent ORR catalytic performance. The LSV results show that the half-wave potential of the Co-N-C catalyst is 0.838 V(Vs RHE), which is only 60 mV lower than that of the commercial 20% commercial Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, the Co-N-C catalyst has a smaller Tafel slope, faster reaction kinetics and better durability. After 6000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry testing, the half-wave potential shows a negative shift of only 5 mV. In the aluminum–air battery test, with a catalyst loading of 1 mg·cm−2 in the air electrode, the Co-N-C catalyst shows higher power output and capacity performance under high current compared with the commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst. The Co-N-C catalyst prepared by this simple and scalable method can obtain good output performance in the aluminum–air battery products, which will play a substantial role in the industrialization of aluminum–air batteries.

Researchers pay more attention to the development of green, environmentally friendly, renewable, safe, and reliable clean energy [1]. Metal fuel cells [2] are suitable for outdoor emergency and off-grid power generation because of their rich material sources, high energy density, long storage life, and recyclability. The electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [3] process of the air electrode [4]is one of the key aspects of metal fuel cells that is vital in extended battery life [5] and access higher power density [6]. Platinum-based catalystsare the best ORR catalysts available, but their use is limited due to their scarcity and high prices, severely restricting their large-scale commercialization [7]. Therefore, the development of efficient and inexpensive metal fuel cell catalysts is of great significance [8]. With the research work of a large number of scientific researchers，the several ORR metal catalysts are reported in the literature, which can be divided into two directions. One is to reduce the amount of precious metals by alloying, morphology and size optimization in catalyst, while improving the performance and stability of catalysts. such as PtGd bimetal [9], PtFe/C [10], Mo-PtCu NF/C [11], palladium liquid metal [12] etc. The other direction is to develop low-cost and efficient non-noble metal catalysts. There are many types of catalysts reported at present, mainly including M-N-C compounds, sulfides, oxides, and heteroatom-doped carbon materials [13–16]. As one of the most promising candidates to replace platinum-based catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the atomically dispersed M–N–C catalysts have better ORR performance due to their maximum atom utilization, effective active sites and satisfactory catalytic activity and stability [17]. such as Fe-N-C [18], Co-N-C [19], Mn-N-C [20] and Polymetallics-N-C [21,22]. In recent years, many sulfides and oxides have been reported as efficient ORR catalysts. However, since the conductivity of the itself affects the charge transfer rate of ORR process, usually anchoring such material on heteroatom-doped carbon substrates for their high conductivity and chemical stability [23]. For example，the catalysts of Ni/(FeNi)9S8 nanoclusters/nitrogen, sulfur-codoped graphitic carbon nanosheets [24] and Co9S8 nanoclusters/Co/Mn-S, N multi-doped 3D porous carbon [25] have reported to have high-efficient and stable oxygen electrocatalysts. Some researchers try different element combinations and morphological structuresto find materials with enhanced catalytic performances [26,27]. Reports on oxides, Sun et al. [28] synthesized Ce-doped MnO2/C catalyst, which contained a large number of quasi-nanometer nanorods with a wound ball shape, The current retention rate is 96.4%, and peak power density in the alkaline aluminum–air battery is 348.8 mW•cm−2. Deng et al. [29] synthesized a Ni–Mn bimetal oxide catalyst using hydrothermal calcination.with a high discharge platform of 1.42 V and a peak power density of 100 mW•cm−2. Although several studies have been conducted, there are still only few catalysts that can be implemented for batch preparation, that are cheap, and that provide high performance and stability in practical applications. In addition, carbon materials [30] have many internal pores and surface defects, such as graphene [31], carbon nanotubes [32], and 3D porous carbons [33], and their excellent specific surface characteristics are favorable for the adhesion of the catalyst. Doping carbon materials with nitrogen [34], sulfur [35], phosphorus [36]and other elements can create defects and change the electronic configuration of the carbon materials, thereby obtaining high-performance and stable carbon-based catalysts [37]. The radius of the nitrogen atom is close to the radius of the carbon atom. Doping carbon with nitrogen atoms can cause the smallest possible distortion of the carbon material’s lattice [38], thereby increasing the defect sites of the porous carbon material, which has received extensive research attention. Although N-doped carbon materials [39] show good stability as ORR electrocatalysts, their activity needs to be further improved. Herein, we proposed a one-step mixed impregnation and heat treatment method. In the simple synthesis method, cobalt nitrate [40] was used as the Co source, Ketjen black (ECP-600JD) [41] was used as the carbon substrate, and urea [42] was used for nitrogen doping. Through a large-scale preparation of nanoscale metal Co-anchored Co-N-C catalyst with a size of 10–30 nm, we found that low Co loading of 5% is required to obtain excellent ORR catalytic performance. The results of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in a 0.1 M KOH solution show that the half-wave potential of the Co-N-C catalyst is 0.838 V(Vs RHE), which is only 60 mV lower than that of the 20% Pt/C catalyst, but it is worth noting that the Co-N-C catalyst has a smaller Tafel slope, and the chemical reaction dynamics process is faster, and the durability performance is better. In the aluminum–air battery test, when using the air electrode with a loading of 1 mg·cm−2, the Co-N-C catalyst has a better performance than the commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst under high current. Co-N-C catalyst will play a substantial role in the industrialization promoting of aluminum–air battery. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Synthesis of electrocatalysts The Co-N-C catalyst was synthesized using a one-step equal-volume mixing impregnation method to simultaneously realize the N doping of the carbon materials and the surface loading of Co. In a typical experiment, 5.47 g of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate and 20 g of urea were dissolved in 100 mL of ethanol solution, and 10 g of Ketjen black carbon (ECP-600 JD) was added to the mixture. Because ethanol was used as the solvent, Ketjen black carbon can quickly infiltrate the solution under stirring conditions, and the mixture is allowed to stand for 12 h at 25 ℃ to obtain the infiltrated carbon that is completely absorbed by the solution. Further, this mixture was placed in a vacuum to dry for 12 h to remove the ethanol solvent at 80 ℃. After drying, the material obtained is fully ground and then treated at 900 ℃ for 2 h in Nitrogen atmosphere, Subsequently, the Co-N-C catalyst is obtained. In the experiment, the Co-N-C catalyst with theoretical Co loadings of 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% were obtained by controlling the amount of cobalt nitrate in the impregnation solution. For comparison, the same process was followed without adding any cobalt nitrate hexahydrate to obtain the control, which was named as the N-C catalyst [43]. ECP-600 JD was purchased from Lion King Fine Chemicals Co., Ltd. of Japan, and the other chemicals were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. of china. 2.2 Physicochemical characterization The surface morphology and structure of the sample were characterized using cold emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8220) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2010 F). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) surface scanning (EDS mapping) were used to collect information on the crystal plane and element distribution status of Co in the sample. The composition and electronic structure of the sample were characterized and analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). 2.3 Electrochemical measurements The ORR performance of the catalyst was measured using CHI 660D electrochemical workstation, with a rotating disk electrode (RRDE-3A) in a three-electrode configuration, and the working electrode is a glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 0.07065 cm2). The counter electrode is a platinum wire electrode, and reference electrode is a Ag/AgCl electrode. The reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) is corrected using the following equation: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 ×pH + 0.197. The catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing 5 mg of the catalyst powder in a 1.0 mL alcohol–water mixture (ethanol-to-water ratio: 4:1) and adding 20 μL of 5% Nafion solution, followed by sonication for 45 min. The electrode was prepared by dropping 5 μL of the catalyst ink on a 0.07065 cm2 glassy carbon electrode and letting it dry naturally with a loading of 0.35 mg/cm2. Commercial Pt/C (20% Pt/C) catalyst was prepared in the same manner as the proportion. During the ORR test, 0.1 KOH was used as the electrolyte., oxygen was continuously supplied to the electrolyte for 30 min before the test. Then, oxygen was supplied to the upper surface of the liquid to ensure the oxygen partial pressure at the interface. For LSV, a scanning rate of 10 mV·s−1 and a test rate of 1600 rpm were used. For the RDE measurement process, the scanning rate was 10 mV·S−1 and the test rate ranged from 400 to 2400 rpm. The electron transfer number (n) for the reaction process is calculated using the Koutecky–Levich equation[44]: 1 J = 1 J L + 1 J K = 1 B ω 1 / 2 + 1 J K B = 0.2 nF C 0 D 0 2 / 3 ν − 1 / 6 where J is the test current density, Jk is the kinetic current density (mA·cm−2), ω is the rotation rate in rpm, F is the Faraday constant (96485 C·mol−1), C0 is the oxygen saturated concentration of O2, which is 1.2 × 10−6 mol·cm−3 in 0.1 M KOH, D0 is the diffusion coefficient of O2 (1.9 × 10−5 cm2·S−1), and v is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte in 0.1 M KOH for 0.01 cm2·S−1) [45]. 2.4 Air electrode The air electrode includes a gas diffusion layer, current collector, and catalytic layer [46–49]. The gas diffusion layer is made of acetylene black, with polytetrafluoroethylene as the binder and ethanol as the dispersant. This layer is 0.4 mm thick. The current collector is made of foamed nickel to collect current and to improve the mechanical strength of the electrode. The gas diffusion layer is press-fitted on both sides of the current collector, and the catalyst slurry (INK) is sprayed on the surface of the gas diffusion layer to obtain an air electrode. The sprayed slurry is configured with a certain amount of the catalyst powder and dispersed in the alcohol–water mixture to obtain a configuration concentration of 20 mg·mL−1. Subsequently, 30% of the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) emulsion is added to it, and the resulting mixture is uniformly dispersed by ultrasonication for 45 min. Thus, a uniformly distributed catalyst ink is obtained. The spraying is carried out using a spray gun, and the catalyst loading of the air electrode is 1 mg·cm−2. Finally, air electrode needs to be heat-treated at 280–320 ℃. 2.5 Aluminum–air battery testing The aluminum–air battery consists of an aluminum anode [50], an air cathode, and an electrolyte [51]. The anode is an Al–Mg–Sn–In alloy plate, with aluminum concentration of not less than 95%. The catalyst loading in the air electrode is 1 mg·cm−2. The electrolyte used was 6 mol·L−1 of KOH with 0.5% of sodium stannate added as an inhibitor. The aluminum–air batteries were measured using a self-made test device in conjunction with battery test system. In the battery test, the working area of the cathode and anode was 4.5 cm2, and the two-stage spacing was 10 mm. The weight of the aluminum anode before and after the test was recorded using an electronic balance, and the anode current efficiency and capacity [52] were calculated based on the weight change. The aluminum–air battery cell is obtained by connecting two cells in series. Each cell includes two air electrodes, and the total working area is about 200 cm2. In the test, the DC–DC device is used to regulate the battery output, and the display device is used to read the real-time output current and voltage of the battery. 3 Results and discussion To screen the optimal loading of metallic Co in the catalyst, we prepared a series of the Co-N-C catalyst samples with different metallic Co contents by controlling the molar amount of cobalt nitrate added during the synthesis process. Fig. S1 shows a comparison of the LSV polarization curves with the sweep rate is 10 mV·S−1. The Co-N-C catalyst under different loads all has good ORR performance, and the onset potential difference is within 40 mV. Moreover, there are certain differences in the limiting current and kinetic process rate under different loads. According to comprehensive comparison, the Co-N-C catalyst with 5% Co load has higher onset potential and limiting current, and its performance is the best among all the samples. Further, Co-N-C-5% catalyst compare to the commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst has a lower metal loading, which ORR performance comparison as shown in Fig. 1a. The figure shows that the obtained the Co-N-C catalyst has a onset potential of 0.953 V (vs the RHE), has 100 mV less than 20% Pt/C catalyst, which means the 20% Pt/C catalyst has better reactivity. The Co-N-C catalyst shows a half-wave potential of 0.838 V, only 60 mV lower than the 20% Pt/C catalyst. Electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was evaluated by electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl) for Co-N-C is 17.35 mF/cm2 (Fig. S2). Fig. 1b shows the Tafel curve, and the Co-N-C catalyst is 79.3 mV·dec−1 while the 20% Pt/C catalyst is 117.1 mV·dec−1, These difference shows Co-N-C catalyst have faster kinetic process compare to the 20% Pt/C catalyst in ORR process [53]. which may be related to the uniform distribution of the catalyst and the fast electron conduction ability between Co and substrate carbon materials. Moreover, the two catalysts have similar limiting currents. The above synthesis shows that the Co-N-C catalyst has good catalytic performance. To verify the influence of Co and N on the ORR performance of the carbon substrate, cobalt nitrate was not introduced during the impregnation process to obtain the pristine N-C. This shows that without N doping, the carbon substrate basically has no ORR catalytic activity, and obvious ORR activity is shown after N doping (Fig. S3). As a catalytically active metal, Co can significantly increase the onset potential and limiting current of the N-C material in the ORR process after further loading (Fig. 1b), and its kinetic process is also significantly accelerated. Therefore, the superior ORR activity of the Co-N-C is attributed to the cooperation effects between the Co nanopaticals with nitrogen-doped carbon substrates. Such as, nano-sized Co expose more active sites; uniform embedded with N-C get faster electron transfer rates and conducive to the interfacial gas diffusion and mass transfer.In summary, by adjusting the impregnation concentration of cobalt nitrate to a 5% loading capacity, the Co-N-C catalyst with high catalytic activity was synthesized. We proved that Co-doping of Co and N synergistically improves the ORR performance of the catalyst. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was used for the electronic structure of the Co-N-C catalyst has shown in Fig. 2. The full XPS spectrum of the sample in Fig. 2a shows that there are chemical bonds between Co, N, C, and O in the sample spectrum. Among them, the O element might be coming from the molecules adsorbed on the surface of the material. Through the high-resolution XPS results of the three elements Co, N, and C, and further analysis of the bonding parameters, Fig. 2b shows the 1 s orbital peak of C. Four integrated peak positions are obtained by fitting, which deconvoluted into the four characteristic peaks for the C–C (284.8 eV), C–N (285.6 eV), CO (287 eV), and C–O (289.8 eV) bonds. The presence of C–N bonds indicates that N atoms are successfully doped in the lattice network of the base carbon material [54]. After N doping, the electron cloud structure of the carbon material is changed, thereby improving its catalytic performance ( Fig. 3). The CO and C–O peaks could correspond to the functional groups attached to the surface. The high-resolution XPS peaks of N are shown in Fig. 2c. The N 1 s peak is deconvoluted into four peaks, corresponding to pyridine N (398.6 eV), pyrrole N (399.8 eV), graphite N (401.1 eV), and nitrogen oxide N (403.3 eV). This illustrates that the N doping in the carbon materials exists in many forms, among which pyridine N is often connected to the metal atoms to form active catalytic sites. Fig. 2d shows high-resolution XPS peaks of the catalytically active metal Co. From that, we can see Co only at bond energy 778.9 eV peak centered, corresponding Co of 2p tracks, means Co is single electron states in the catalyst sample in the presence of Simple substance metal. The Ketjen black carbon material used in the experiment has a granular structure. In Fig. 3a shows that the morphological structure of the base carbon before and after doping has not changed which indicating that it has good stability. The doped catalyst has a large number of small particles attached to it, which are the loaded active Co nanoparticles. Further the TEM (Fig. 3b) and HRTEM (Fig. 3d) clearly show that the supported catalyst has a uniform distribution in the carbon substrate, and the size of the catalyst particles is between 10 and 30 nm. The uniform distribution of the nanoscale catalyst particles in the carbon material provides support for good performance. Fig. 3c shows the HRTEM image of the crystal plane surface of the catalyst particles, characteristic shows parameters particle surfaces of the two lattice fringes 0.208 nm and 0.180 nm corresponding to the (111) and (200) crystal planes of Co. Further, the XRD test results of the sample (Fig. 3f) shows the diffraction peak corresponding to Co (JCPDS No: 15-0806), and the diffraction peak at the low angle corresponds to the steamed bun peak of amorphous carbon. The results show that the XRD tests crystal plane diffraction peak and the HRTEM corresponds. Combined with XPS analysis results, the metal component of the catalyst sample Co loading on the Co-N-C catalyst. Fig. 3e shows the STEM of the Co-N-C catalyst sample and the corresponding elemental mapping. The results show that the Co, N, and C elements are well distributed throughout the catalyst, and the reason of low intensity is Co may be scattered throughout the carbon coating, the Large-area EDX spectrum (Fig. S4) also can conform this result. Before applying the catalyst to batteries, it is necessary to further understand the ORR process and life performance of the catalyst. For the ORR process, the ideal way is to directly reduce O2 to OH− (O2 + 2 H2O + 4e−→4OH−) through four-electron transfer. This requires the catalyst to have good ORR catalytic performance, but for common unmodified carbon materials or metal oxides, the ORR process often proceeds by the two-electron transfer pathway (O2 + H2O + 2e−→HO2 − + OH−). To study the ORR pathway of the Co-N-C catalyst samples, we performed RDE measurements at different rates ( Fig. 4a). The figure shows that the limiting current of the catalyst increases linearly with the increase in the rotation rate, which is mainly due to the influence of the diffusion rate of the reactants and products at the different rotation rates. The number of electron transfers can be obtained from the Koutecky–Levich equation (Equations 1–2). Fig. 4b shows that number of electron transfer in the potential range of 0.2–0.4 V is close to 4. Which indicated the ORR process of Co-N-C catalyst is basically an efficient four-electron transfer path, which shows good catalytic performance. Durability is an important indicator when evaluating the ORR performance of a catalyst, and the stability of the catalyst is even more critical when used in metal fuel cells. Thus, we use two methods to test the stability of the catalyst. Fig. 4c shows the accelerated test results of the Co-N-C catalyst. The LSV curve changes before and after 6000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) are compared. which potential window is 0.6–1.0 V vs RHE. The result shows that the half-wave potential of the Co-N-C catalyst after 6000 cycles, only a negative shift of 5 mV. Further I-t curve selection is carried out at the limiting current density corresponding to 0.6 V (Vs RHE). The durability test shows that the relative attenuation of Co-N-C in the 16,000 s CA test in alkaline medium is 95.2%, which is 4.2% higher than that of the Pt/C catalyst under the same test conditions. The above results show that the Co-N-C catalyst has better stability than the commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst, which is attributed to the high distribution uniformity and tight bonding strength of the low-load active material and the carbon material. Based on the excellent ORR performance of the Co-N-C catalyst, we loaded the catalyst on the gas diffusion layer to prepare an air electrode (Fig. S5) for the aluminum–air battery to explore its performance in the actual application process, the battery assembly as shown in Fig. S6, and the distance between the air electrode and Al electrodes is 1 cm, 20% Pt/C catalyst under the same process conditions is used as a reference. The ORR process of the air electrode occurs at the three-phase interface [55] of the catalytic layer, so a certain amount of PTFE needs to use as a binder and provide a hydrophobic gas-phase interface. Fig. 5a shows the effect if varying PTFE compositions in the catalyst layer of the Co-N-C catalyst on the polarization curve. The results show that lower amounts PTFE of 20% and 30%in the air electrode exhibits better discharge performance and better power density. As the composition of PTFE increases, the performance decreases, which may be related to the increase in resistance of the catalytic layer caused by the insulation of PTFE itself. Fig. 5b shows a comparison of the polarization and power density curves of the Co-N-C and the commercial 20% Pt/C catalysts. When the current density less then 40 mA cm−2, the 20% Pt/C catalyst has an higher voltage than that of the Co-N-C catalyst, which reflects that the 20% Pt/C catalyst has higher activity. This is consistent with the ORR test result. The performance of the Co-N-C catalyst has better performance under higher current density. At the current density of 150 mA·cm−2, the battery voltage and power density of the Co-N-C catalyst are 0.99 V and 148 mW·cm−2 and the 20% Pt/C catalyst are 0.87 V and 130 mW·cm−2, respectively. In the extreme case, the power density of the Co-N-C catalyst can reach 174 mW·cm−2, which is 39 mW·cm−2 higher than that of the 20% Pt/C catalyst. Further constant current gradient discharge also verified this result (Fig. 5c), which shows that both the Co-N-C and 20% Pt/C catalysts have good performance in current response. To explanation of the higher activity of Co-N-C in the cell test compare with 20% Pt/C, the EIS of air electrodes of Co-N-C and Pt/C has been studied in a three-electrode test under the same conditions (Fig. S7a), which found that the charge transfer impedance of Pt/C is relatively small, shows the higher ORR catalytic activity than Co-N-C. However, the air electrode of Co-N-C has a lower ohmic resistance, which have a greater impact on the ohmic polarization part of the battery, and this effect will obviously become more prominent with increase of current density. Comparing the hydrophobic state of Co-N-C and Pt/C air electrode catalyst layer (Fig. S7b), we believe that the influence on ohmic resistance is due to the hydrophilic and hydrophobic changes caused by different catalyst properties and binder matching.For the long-term test of the battery, we used a larger current density of 50 mA·cm−2 to measure the constant current discharge of the battery. The weight of the consumed aluminum plate is obtained by weighing the difference before and after the reaction. The results show that the Co-N-C catalyst has a higher voltage than the 20% Pt/C catalyst during the discharge process, and the discharge time is longer. The Co-N-C air electrode shows a capacity of 1148 mAh·g−1, and the capacity of the 20% Pt/C catalyst is only 681 mAh·g−1 under the same conditions. The above results show that in the aluminum–air system with 6 M KOH as the electrolyte, the Co-N-C catalyst has better performance at high current, which is more conducive to product application. To evaluate the application of the Co-N-C catalyst in actual alkaline aluminum–air battery products, as shown in Fig. S8 we assembled the air electrode loaded with the Co-N-C catalyst into two aluminum–air battery cells and connected them in series.The working area of each battery is 100 cm2. 0.5% of sodium stannate was added to the 6 M KOH electrolyte solution. The batteries in series are connected to a mobile phone and a colorful light string at 25 ℃. To evaluate the performance and stability of the actual output, the DC–DC and the display are connected to the battery for rectification and display output. The battery in Fig. 6a have a open circuit voltage of 3.41 V, and each battery is about 1.7 V. Fig. 6b shows an actual access load output of 4.23 V and 2.97 A, with an output power of up to 12.6 W. Fig. 6c and 6d show that the battery can quickly charge the mobile phone with a power of 9 W, and it can also supply the required power for lighting a light string. In summary, the results show that Co-N-C catalyst has good performance and application prospects as ORR catalysts for aluminum–air batteries. 4 Conclusion Herein, we Put forward a convenient method to prepared large-scale N-doped carbon (Co-N-C) catalyst material supported by nanoscale Co through a one-step mixed impregnation and heat treatment method. By adjusting the synthesis process, we found that the Co loading of 5% allows the Co-N-C catalyst achieve excellent ORR catalytic performance. In contrast, the active material has a good distribution in the entire catalyst. The LSV test results show that the Co-N-C catalyst of the half-wave potential of 0.838 V, only the ratio of the 20% Pt/C catalyst low 60 mV, although the catalytic activity is less than that of the commercial 20% the Pt/C catalyst. However, the Co-N-C catalyst has smaller Tafel slope and faster reaction kinetics learning process. The catalyst durability test results show that the stability of the Co-N-C catalyst is more excellent in 16000 s the CA tests, which current is maintained higher than that of the 20% Pt/C catalyst by 4.2%. In the aluminum–air battery test, the Co-N-C catalyst has a better performance under high current than the commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst. At a current density of 150 mA·cm−2, the battery voltage and power density of the Co-N-C catalyst are 0.99 V and 148 mW·cm−2 and those of the 20% Pt/C catalyst are 0.87 V and 130 mW·cm−2, respectively. Two aluminum–air battery cells in series are prepared using the Co-N-C catalyst air electrode with a load of 1 mg·cm−2, and they have a rated output of up to 12 W, which can realize mobile phone charging and light a string of lights simultaneously, showing good application prospects.

        "dc:description": "High-performance, stable and inexpensive catalysts use for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process are indispensable in the cathode and play an important role in the practical application and industrialization of metal air batteries. In recent years, highly efficient and stable nonprecious metal catalysts have been the focus of research, and cobalt and cobalt oxides being promising options. Herein, we propose a one-step mixed impregnation method to prepare a nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst, after heat treatment the Co-anchored to N-doped carbon catalyst (Co-N-C) with 10–30 nm of Co uniformly distributed was obtained. Which find that 5% Co loading is enough to obtain excellent ORR catalytic performance. The LSV results show that the half-wave potential of the Co-N-C catalyst is 0.838 V(Vs RHE), which is only 60 mV lower than that of the commercial 20% commercial Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, the Co-N-C catalyst has a smaller Tafel slope, faster reaction kinetics and better durability. After 6000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry testing, the half-wave potential shows a negative shift of only 5 mV. In the aluminum–air battery test, with a catalyst loading of 1 mg·cm−2 in the air electrode, the Co-N-C catalyst shows higher power output and capacity performance under high current compared with the commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst. The Co-N-C catalyst prepared by this simple and scalable method can obtain good output performance in the aluminum–air battery products, which will play a substantial role in the industrialization of aluminum–air batteries.",
