Graphical abstract The diverse working mechanisms of the magneto-catalytic effect (MCE) on the activity and selectivity of ferromagnetic catalysts in complex catalytic reactions were illustrated with computational tools. Tuning the catalyst’s activity and selectivity is usually achieved by modifying the electronic structure through strategies such as alloying, doping, strain, and ligand modification, but inevitably accompanied by geometric structure changes of catalysts. It is challenging to modify a catalyst’s electronic structure without changing its geometric structure. Recent studies found that the second-order ferromagnetic to paramagnetic (FM-PM) phase transition could promote catalytic performance without altering the geometric structures of active sites, which was also known as the magneto-catalytic effect (MCE). However, the understanding of the MCE is still incomplete. Herein, we conducted systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations to clarify the complex reaction mechanisms for conversions of nitrogen-containing small molecules on both FM and PM Ni (111) surfaces. Our microkinetic modeling (MKM) results demonstrate that FM-PM phase transition promotes the N2O decomposition activity of FM Ni catalyst but decreases its activity for NO decomposition while showing a negligible influence on the activity of ammonia decomposition. These results indicate the promotion, inhibition, and disappearance mechanisms of MCE on the catalytic activity, which further changes the selectivity of different products. We anticipate the MCE will work as an effective strategy for fine-tuning the activity and selectivity of ferromagnetic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis, providing an extra basis for rational catalyst design.

In the last century, the birth of classical catalysis theories, such as the Sabatier principle [3,4] and d-band center theory [5], dramatically deepened our understanding of reactivity trends among different catalysts and guided the rational catalyst design via electronic structure calculations from density functional theory (DFT). Indeed, these catalysis theories adequately guided the development of effective strategies, such as alloying [6], doping [7], ligand modification [8], strain [9], confinement [10,11], and defect engineering [12,13], to tune the electronic structures of the catalysts to best match the catalytic process. Noteworthy, regulating electronic structures via the aforementioned strategies is inevitably accompanied by changes in the chemical structures of catalysts because the chemical and electronic structures are tightly coupled with each other [14,15]. Then, the direct question is: How can we modify the electronic structure of a catalyst without changing its chemical structure? Or, how can the catalyst’s performance be enhanced without altering the active sites and lattice structure? Indeed, manipulating inter-atomic magnetic orderings (another crucial manifestation of the spin effect in crystalline solids apart from the on-site spin state) of magnetic catalysts in our recent works [16] provides an ideal answer to this question. That is, the ferromagnetic (FM) order collapses into paramagnetic (PM) order at Curie points [17–20] via a second-order phase transition, where FM and PM states with the same chemical structure but different electronic structures will show different catalytic performances, known as the magneto-catalytic effect (MCE). Our case study of this effect on the Haber-Bosch process showed that the FM-PM phase transition promoted the ammonia synthesis rates of FM Co and Ni catalysts by 2–4 orders of magnitude. Apart from the FM and PM states, we further developed a simple and practical computational procedure to simulate the partially demagnetized (DM) states of ferromagnet by spin-wave (magnon) excitations, theoretically identifying the 55 % DM cobalt metal as the genuine Sabatier optimal for ammonia synthesis [21]. The roles of spin and magnetism in heterogenous catalysis have already attracted scientists’ attention from both theory and experiment with rich achievements. For example, Gracia et al. [22,23] investigated the impacts of ground-state quantum spin exchange interactions (QSEI) and strongly correlated electrons on catalytic processes, conceptually demonstrating the potential influence on catalytic performance, mainly in the activity of oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and water splitting [24]. Escaño et al. [25], reported spin-orientation dependence of O2 reactivity on Ni(111) surface from DFT calculations. Meanwhile, Xu and coworkers experimentally performed a spin-pining strategy to reduce the barrier of electron transfer, which resulted in enhanced water oxidation activity [26]. In addition, Xu et al., also proposed that the increased activity in field-enhanced FM catalysts is related to the domain walls [27–29]. Note that the aforementioned works mainly describe the roles of the magnetic ground state properties on catalysis, while the magneto-catalytic effect (MCE) mentioned in the current work describes those of magnetic excited state properties, thereby elegantly incorporating the temperature dependence of the magnetism into heterogeneous catalysis. Since alloys, oxides, and hydroxyl oxides containing Fe, Co, and Ni are usually magnetic and widely used as ideal earth-abundant catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis, the tuning of magnetic ordering will provide new possibilities to steer the catalytic performances of this special catalyst family. Noteworthy, the relationship between the on-site magnetic moment (spin-state in molecular catalysts) and catalytic performances has been widely discussed in the literature [30–36] since the corresponding theories and applications are well-established in homogeneous catalysis. However, the effect of the inter-atomic magnetic ordering on the catalytic performances of heterogeneous catalysts, MCE, has not yet been thoroughly elucidated and well understood in heterogeneous catalysis. Despite the promotion mechanism of MCE in the activities of FM Co and Ni catalysts for ammonia synthesis being well elaborated in our previous works [16,21], there are still many unclear points to be clarified due to the high complexity of heterogeneous catalysis, i.e., Are there other working mechanisms of the MCE on catalytic activity besides promotion? How does MCE affect the catalytic selectivity? In this work, we chose the catalytic conversions of N-containing small molecules (N2, NO, NO2, N2O, NH3, and N2H4) as the model reactions to illustrate the diverse mechanisms of the MCE on the activity and selectivity of the FM Ni catalyst. Our choice is based on the rich chemistry (Scheme 1 ) and crucial applications involved in the N-containing molecules conversions, i.e., NO decomposition in NOx emission regulation technology [37], NO and N2 hydrogenation for production of NH3 and N2H4 [38], NH3 decomposition for H2 [39], and N2O decomposition reaction [40]. Our DFT calculations and mean-field microkinetic modeling (MKM) results show that the FM-PM phase transition of Ni results in a decreased activity for the NO decomposition reaction but increased activity for N2O decomposition, while the activity of NH3 decomposition is hardly affected. Meanwhile, the selectivity of different products in the NO hydrogenation reaction was obviously altered by the FM-PM phase transition. This study not only enriches the working mechanisms of MCE in complex reactions but also provides an extra approach to fine-tuning the selectivity. 2 Computational details All calculations were conducted using the periodic plane-wave-based density functional theory (DFT) method implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package [41] (VASP) within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [42]. Valence electrons were described by the plane waves with an energy cutoff of 400 eV, whereas core electrons were represented by projector augmented-wave pseudopotentials [43]. The BEEF-vdW functional was used to describe the exchange–correlation contribution to the electronic energy [44], which was widely proven to be capable of adequately describing chemisorptions [45]. Structure optimizations were done until forces became smaller than 0.05 eV/Å, and the energy difference was lower than 10−4 eV. Transition state geometries were located using the climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) [46] method. The vibration frequencies were calculated for all species. The thermodynamic corrections were calculated within the Harmonic approximation for adsorbates and ideal-gas approximation for gaseous molecules. The catalytic properties of FM Ni catalyst were simulated using the most stable (111) surface of face-centered-cubic Ni metal shown in Scheme 1 B, where a (2 × 2) supercell was used to model the slab. A vacuum layer of 12 Å was set between periodically repeated slabs to avoid interactions. The k-point sampling was performed using Monkhorst-Pack grids of 4 × 4 × 1 for the Brillouin zone of the primitive cell. Spin polarization was included to describe the magnetic properties of FM Ni properly. Noteworthy, simulating the PM state of the FM material is not a trivial task, where the localized and itinerant magnets should be described with different physical pictures [21]. In the framework of Stoner’s theory, the spin-polarized band theory could reasonably describe the magnetic ground state of itinerant magnets, while the demagnetization of fully itinerant systems is predicted through spin-flips until achieving a “non-magnetic” PM state. This also inspired the simulations of PM states with non-spin-polarized (NSP) calculations [47–51]. For example, Siegel and co-workers investigated the carbon segregation-dissolution on pure Ni with NSP-DFT calculations [52], and the simulated results agreed well with experiments [53,54]. Since the FM to PM is a second-order phase transition, the lattice constant of the PM state would not directly change from the FM state by definition [55,56]. It was also experimentally reported that the lattice parameter of Ni at its Curie temperature was almost identical to that at low temperatures [57]. Therefore, the PM Ni is modeled using the same structural parameters as the FM state, and the electronic structure is obtained from the NSP-DFT calculation. Rational catalyst design calls for a deep understanding of the fundamental surface kinetics controlling catalyst performance, while microkinetic modeling is a tool that can help streamline this process [58–60]. In this work, mean-field microkinetic modeling (MKM) was conducted to analyze the reaction rates of different products at given temperatures and pressures. The CatMAP code [58] was applied to solve the differential equations in the MKM. More details are shown in the supporting information. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of FM-PM phase transition on binding energies and energy barriers In a typical computational study of reaction mechanisms on solid catalysts, the binding energies (Eb) of reaction intermediates and energy barrier (Ea) for each elementary step on the active sites are the basis for understanding the thermodynamics and kinetics of a reaction. Therefore, we systematically calculated the Eb and Ea of all intermediates and elementary steps involved in the conversions among N-containing molecules shown in Scheme 1 A (detailed information is provided in Scheme S1A) on both FM and PM Ni(111) surfaces. To identify the most stable adsorption configurations of each species, we specifically considered all possible adsorption sites. The PM Ni generally exhibited much stronger binding strengths with adsorbates than the FM counterpart (detailed information is provided in Fig. S1 A and Table S2 ), which could be explained by its higher d-band center value (Scheme 1 C and 1D). Noteworthy, other models [61,62] were also reported to improve the d-band theory in magnetic systems, which was primarily intended to address the issue of combining two subbands to describe the adsorption energy quantitatively. Meanwhile, the degree of increase in binding strength due to FM-PM phase transition is quite different among adsorbates, i.e., the Eb of atomic N changes up to 0.370 eV, while that of OH species is only 0.042 eV. This trend has been found in our previous work regarding the magneto-catalytic effect in ammonia synthesis [16]. Unlike the universally enhanced binding strengths of adsorbates, energy barriers for different elementary steps show diverse responses to the FM-PM phase transition, i.e., Ea of NO dissociation decreases by 0.107 eV; Ea of NN coupling to N2 increases by 0.266 eV, while Ea for NO + H → NOH is almost unchanged (detailed information is provided in Fig. S1B and Table S4 ). Indeed, the different degree of changes in Eb and Ea due to FM-PM phase transition will result in quite different working mechanism of MCE on different reactions as shown in Fig. 1 A. For example, if Ea decreases much larger than Eb, FM-PM phase transition will increase the activity, i.e., the promotion effect. If Ea decreases much smaller than Eb, FM-PM phase transition will decrease the activity, i.e., the inhibition effect. However, if the increase in Ea1 for an elementary step is similar to the decrease in Ea2 of another elementary step, then, FM-PM phase transition will not change the activity, i.e., the “disappeared” effect. A very specific example is shown in Fig. 1 C, where the universally enhanced Eb and diverse degree of change in Ea could be found in the NO decomposition reaction to N2 and O2 due to the FM-PM phase transition of Ni catalyst. Therefore, the universally enhanced binding strength of adsorbates and the versatilely affected energy barriers for different reactions resulting from FM-PM phase transition will make MCE a versatile strategy to tune the catalytic performances for different reactions. 3.2 The diverse effects of MCE on activity The raw DFT data in Figure S1 has manifested the potential impacts of FM-PM phase transition on reactivity but lacks straightforward information showcasing how activities are affected. In this part, based on the complex reaction networks in Scheme 1 A, we established mean-field microkinetic models (MKM) for a group of reactions to elaborate on the effect of FM-PM phase transition on the reaction rates of different products on Ni catalysts. More details of MKM are summarized in supporting information. Promotion Effect on Activity. We started with the decomposition of nitrous oxide (N2O) on the Ni catalyst, which was also the classic model reaction to illustrate the MCE reported by Hedvall and his coworkers [63,64]. Based on the elementary steps for this reaction summarized in Scheme 1 and Supporting Information, our MKM results in Fig. 2 A and B showed that the calculated turnover frequency (TOF) for N2O decomposition on the PM Ni (111) surfaces is 2–4 orders higher than the FM counterpart at the same reaction conditions, which clearly indicates the promotion effect of MCE on this reaction. Further detailed analysis of this reaction mechanism reveals that the energy barriers for NNO bond breakings decreased by 0.16 eV due to the enhanced binding strengths of NO and N after the FM-PM phase transition. Note that the potential diffusion of O or N to the subsurface was not considered in our MKM, which might also be affected by MCE. Indeed, this promotion effect is consistent with the experimentally detected findings in the pioneering work of MCE reported by Hedvall et al. in 1934 [63,64]. Meanwhile, we conducted the mechanistic analysis of the Haber-Bosch process on the Ni (111) surface. Our MKM results in supporting note 1 show that the TOF for NH3 production on the PM Ni (111) surface is 2–4 orders higher than the FM counterpart at the same reaction conditions, which is also similar to our previous findings on the stepped Ni (211) surface [16]. Close inspections showed that PM Ni exhibits a lower energy barrier for N2 dissociation than FM Ni, which is responsible for the increased reaction rate. Therefore, the MCE shows a promotion effect on the activity of Ni catalysts in ammonia synthesis. Inhibition Effect on Activity. Then, we move to the NO decomposition reaction with a crucial application in industrial NOx emission regulations [37], which proceeds via NO dissociation followed by the formations of NN and OO bonds. Based on our MKM results for this reaction in Fig. 2 C and D, the TOF for NO decomposition on the PM Ni (111) surface is much lower than the FM counterpart at the same reaction conditions, which indicates the inhibition effect of FM-PM phase transition on the activity of Ni catalyst in NO decomposition reaction. Further detailed analysis of this reaction mechanism reveals that the energy barriers for NN and OO bond formations dramatically increase due to the enhanced binding strengths of N and O after the FM-PM phase transition, although the NO dissociation energy barrier decreases by 0.107 eV. Therefore, the inhibition effect of MCE could be specifically explained by these mechanistic analyses. “Disappeared” Effect on Activity. Among all the reactions in Scheme 1 A, the direct NH3 decomposition shows a special response to MCE. This reaction is very significant during the development of hydrogen storage technology because NH3 is an ideal hydrogen carrier due to its high hydrogen content and easy liquefication at low pressures [65]. Based on our detailed mechanistic studies and MKM results in Fig. 2 E and F, we found that the FM and PM Ni (111) surfaces have limited differences in TOF of NH3 decomposition at a wide range of reaction conditions. Close inspections of this reaction mechanism showed that the energy barriers for NH2 H, NHH, and NH bond breakings decreased by 0.265 eV, 0.158 eV, and 0.064 eV, respectively, while Ea for NN formation increased by 0.266 eV after FM-PM phase transition. This indicates that the decreased Ea for NHx H bond breakings and the increased Ea for NN formation get canceled, eventually resulting in a similar TOF value for these two states of Ni (111) surface and the “absence” of magneto-catalytic effect (MCE) on the activity of NH3 decomposition. Interestingly, Ertl and Rüstig [66] reported the absence of MCE in NH3 decomposition on nickel in 1982, where they claimed that there was no measurable activity below 700 K. In this respect, we anticipate that such “absence” might be better defined as a special type of MCE rather than a real absence based on our above-detailed mechanism analysis. In summary, our systematic analysis of the mechanisms for different reactions identified three different working mechanisms of MCE on the catalytic activity, showcasing its generality and diversity in heterogeneous catalysis. Therefore, the catalytic activity of magnetic catalysts should be revisited with caution and in an objective way. 3.3 Roles of MCE in tuning selectivity. Based on the aforementioned diverse effects of MCE on the activities of different reactions, it is foreseeable that the FM state will show a different selectivity from the PM state for a given catalytic process, especially for the multi-product reactions. To clarify the impact of FM-PM phase transition on the selectivity of the Ni catalyst in N-containing molecule conversions, we chose the NO hydrogenation as the model reaction because it involves the breakings and formations of NO, NH, OH, OO, and NN bonds and produces multiple products as NH3, N2, O2, N2O, NO2, NH2OH, and N2H4. Our MKM analysis in Fig. 3 A and B shows that the selectivity for N2 production is quite different on FM and PM states of Ni (111) surface at the same reaction condition. For example, at 700 K and 10−3 bar, the selectivity of N2 and N2O is 31.7 % and 24.4 % on FM Ni, while these values on the PM Ni are 1.4 % and 64.8 %, respectively. Clearly, the FM-PM phase transition dramatically changes the selectivity of the NO hydrogenation reaction. To better illustrate the essence of MCE in properly understanding the catalytic performances of magnetic catalysts, we plotted the relationship between selectivity changes and temperatures on the FM and PM states of the Ni (111) surfaces. On the FM Ni (111) surface in Fig. 3 C, the selectivity of N2O is the highest at low temperatures but starts to decrease at 600 K, accompanied by an increase in the selectivity of N2, while a crossover point among different products appears at 700 K. On the PM Ni (111) surface in Fig. 3 D, there is a similar trend for the selectivity change, but the crossover point appears at 850 K. In this respect, neither FM nor PM state could properly describe the overall selectivity of Ni catalyst in NO hydrogenation. Since the Curie point, where FM-PM phase transition occurs, is around 629 K for bulk Ni, the selectivity results above 629 K for the FM state (dashed lines in Fig. 3 C) and below 629 K for the PM state (dashed lines in Fig. 3 D) could be inadequate. Therefore, the proper way to describe the overall selectivity of the FM Ni catalyst is to combine the two sections at the Tc of Ni catalyst. As shown in Fig. 3 E, there are obvious changes in the selectivity of each product at Tc, i.e., the FM-PM phase transition results in an increase in the N2O selectivity while the selectivity for N2 and NO2 decreases. Unfortunately, there are no available experimental results to discuss the effect of the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition on the selectivity of this complex reaction. Our above analysis demonstrates the essential role of FM-PM phase transition in tuning the selectivity of a complex reaction with multiple products. Meanwhile, we emphasized that the MCE could not be simply ignored when analyzing the catalytic performances of magnetic catalysts, where each magnetic state should be treated separately. An adequate overall performance description could only be achieved by combining rational regions with the phase transition point (Curie point) as the boundary. 4 Conclusion In summary, we theoretically illustrated the promotion, inhibition, and “absence” mechanisms of magneto-catalytic effect (MCE) on the activity and selectivity of ferromagnetic (FM) Ni catalyst in catalytic conversions of N-containing small molecules. Our systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations of reaction mechanisms on the Ni catalyst show that the ferromagnetic–paramagnetic (FM-PM) phase transition universally enhances the binding strengths of all NxHyOz species but shows diverse effects (increase, decrease, and no change) on the energy barriers for different elementary steps. Meanwhile, we established microkinetic models to simulate the reaction rates for different reactions, where the FM-PM phase transition resulted in the increased activity of FM Ni catalyst for N2O decomposition, decreased activity for NO decomposition, as well as almost unchanged activity for ammonia decomposition. Such diverse effects on different reactions inevitably changed the selectivity of each product, making MCE a new strategy to tune the selectivity. Unfortunately, MCE currently does not receive enough attention in heterogeneous catalysis, especially for computational catalysis. Therefore, we hope to emphasize that both FM and PM phases are physical states of magnetic materials, which should be specifically considered when analyzing the catalytic performances of catalysts with magnetism. Our work not only extends the working mechanisms and applications of MCE but also opens a complicated and attractive paradigm for a better understanding of magnetic-material-based heterogeneous catalysis. We believe the MCE will find broader applications and make greater impacts in heterogeneous catalysis.

        "dc:description": "Tuning the catalyst’s activity and selectivity is usually achieved by modifying the electronic structure through strategies such as alloying, doping, strain, and ligand modification, but inevitably accompanied by geometric structure changes of catalysts. It is challenging to modify a catalyst’s electronic structure without changing its geometric structure. Recent studies found that the second-order ferromagnetic to paramagnetic (FM-PM) phase transition could promote catalytic performance without altering the geometric structures of active sites, which was also known as the magneto-catalytic effect (MCE). However, the understanding of the MCE is still incomplete. Herein, we conducted systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations to clarify the complex reaction mechanisms for conversions of nitrogen-containing small molecules on both FM and PM Ni (111) surfaces. Our microkinetic modeling (MKM) results demonstrate that FM-PM phase transition promotes the N2O decomposition activity of FM Ni catalyst but decreases its activity for NO decomposition while showing a negligible influence on the activity of ammonia decomposition. These results indicate the promotion, inhibition, and disappearance mechanisms of MCE on the catalytic activity, which further changes the selectivity of different products. We anticipate the MCE will work as an effective strategy for fine-tuning the activity and selectivity of ferromagnetic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis, providing an extra basis for rational catalyst design.",
