Rh-substituted pyrochlore catalysts were prepared and tested for the partial oxidation (POX) of n-tetradecane (TD), a diesel fuel surrogate. The catalysts were substituted lanthanum zirconates with the chemical formula La1.89Ca0.11Zr1.75−x Rh x Y0.25O7−y (with either 0, 1, 2, or 3wt% of Rh loading). The catalysts underwent a variety of pre- and post-reaction characterization with a focus on deposited carbon, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation. To assess the nature of potential catalytic sites (typically attributed to Rh), each substituted catalyst produced three temperature programmed reduction peaks, with an increase in the most reducible sites at higher Rh loadings. In additions, the catalysts with 2 and 3wt% Rh substitution displayed a secondary crystal phase in their XRD spectra; however, this phase disappeared when the sample was reduced up to 900°C, representative of reaction conditions. To assess carbon deposition after reaction testing, a temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) was conducted on each sample from 250 to 750°C. Each sample produced three CO2 peaks between 250 and 550°C, referred to as low temperature carbon (LTC) peaks, and two peaks at higher temperatures (>600°C). The 2wt% catalyst was run for different times under POX of TD, and the TPO results showed that the amount of LTC reached a steady state within 2h and did not increase even up to 18h under reaction conditions. This indicates that the LTC is not likely responsible for catalyst deactivation. In contrast, the quantity of carbon associated with the higher temperature peaks under TPO increased with reaction time. The carbon associated with the high temperature peaks was highly graphitic, and is typically attributed to deposits on the catalyst inert surfaces and/or inert bed material. After a partial burn-off of the LTC, Raman analysis showed no significant change in the surface carbon. These results suggest that improvement in catalyst performance may be accomplished by modification of the catalyst formulation to increase the resistance to carbon formation on the oxide surface. Such modifications include surface promoters, B-site dopant level, and addition of an oxygen-conducting support. Future work will explore these approaches. Keywords Catalytic partial oxidation Liquid hydrocarbon fuel Pyrochlore catalyst Carbon deposition Temperature programmed oxidation 1 Introduction Among several potential applications, reforming liquid hydrocarbons into syngas can be used to operate a solid oxide fuel cell for auxiliary power units in long-haul trucks, and for remote, or distributed power generation [1]. For these applications the use of water (i.e. steam reforming, SR, or autothermal reforming, ATR) may not be practical. Instead, partial oxidation (POX) or oxidative steam reforming (OSR), the use of oxygen and steam in ratios different from ATR, may be a more attractive approach to generating syngas. However, these reactions require high temperatures; and, for fuels containing sulfur and aromatic contaminants, like diesel, traditional supported metal reforming catalysts will deactivate rapidly from excessive carbon deposition [2–7], as well as from sintering [8,9], and sulfur poisoning [10–13]. Catalyst deactivation from excessive carbon deposition is inevitable in hydrocarbon reforming. However, deactivation can be reduced by substituting the active metals into thermally stable oxide crystal structures such as perovskites [14–17], pyrochlores [18–21], and hexaaluminates [19,22–27]. Pyrochlores, into which catalytically active metals have been substituted, have demonstrated high thermal stability while limiting carbon formation, the latter believed to be the result of increased oxygen mobility compared to an unmodified pyrochlore [28–30]. The pyrochlore structure, A2B2O7, can accommodate substitution into both the A- and B-sites of the lattice, which allows for the addition of both promoter and active catalytic metals [28]. Doping the pyrochlore structure with these metals can produce a catalyst that possesses several unique properties that are beneficial for hydrocarbon reforming: high catalytic activity, thermal stability, sulfur tolerance, and oxygen conductivity [18–21,28–31]. A significant reforming study utilized a Rh-substituted pyrochlore, supported by zirconium-doped ceria (ZDC), to successfully convert commercial diesel fuel to syngas for 1000h under OSR conditions [31]. In that study, notable carbon mitigation was achieved by the ZDC support; however, some benefit was also attributed to the doping of the A- and B-site with Ca and Y, respectively. It is believed that further improvements to the active pyrochlore phase itself can be accomplished through other formula modifications. To guide this effort, additional understanding of how and where carbon forms on the catalyst surface under reaction conditions would be very useful. The formation of carbon on reforming catalysts has been studied extensively [3,4,7,22,32,33]; however, the majority of these studies were conducted on traditional supported metal catalysts. Shamsi et al. [32] conducted a study on a Pt catalyst deposited on an unmodified alumina support. Unmodified alumina was used to eliminate the effect of promoters on the carbon deposition, which had not previously been reported. The catalyst was tested with several different hydrocarbon fuels, and under three different reforming modes (SR, ATR, and POX). After each test, the carbon deposited on the catalyst and support surfaces was burned off under temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) to observe the types and quantity of carbon formed. In all cases, carbon burn-off peaks were observed at several different temperatures. Peaks observed below 200°C were attributed to carbon on the deposited metal, while higher temperature peaks were attributed to carbon deposited on the catalyst support. A few studies using mixed-metal oxide catalysts have been reported for reforming [34,35], but in these materials, the active metal was a major constituent of the crystal structure. For example, a praseodymium ruthenate (Pr2Ru2O7) was studied as a reforming catalyst [34], but it was shown that under reaction conditions the Ru was reduced and the pyrochlore crystal structure broke down, resulting in a Pr2O3 supported Ru catalyst. Similarly, Eu2Ir2O7 decomposed to Ir metal supported on Eu2O3 under methane dry reforming [35]. The approach of partial substitution of a catalytically active metal is a relatively new one, which appears to offer additional benefits under high temperature, highly reducing conditions, like those produced during the catalytic POX of liquid hydrocarbons. Thorough characterization of the different surface sites that are present in these types of materials (i.e. complex oxides with multiple partial metal substitutions) is still to be done. The initial purpose of this study is to perform the most useful characterization (e.g. metal reducibility, dispersion, crystal structure) that is relevant to reforming catalyst performance and carbon deposition. The second purpose is to examine how carbon deposits during POX experiments on the different reducible sites of a Rh-substituted La2Zr2O7 pyrochlore with different active metal loadings, and for different lengths of time. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst synthesis The Rh-substituted pyrochlores were prepared by a modified Pechini method [36]. Generally, nitrate salts of each metal were dissolved separately in de-ionized water and then combined with a citric acid (CA) solution. The solution was heated to 65°C while being stirred to ensure complete metal complexation. Once at 65°C, ethylene glycol (EG) was added to the solution. The solution was stirred continuously at temperature until most of the water had evaporated, leaving a transparent, viscous gel. The gel was transferred to a heating mantle preheated to 70°C. The temperature in the mantle was increased to 140°C to promote the polyesterification reaction between EG and CA, which produced an organic polymeric network [37]. This foam-like material was placed in an oven at 130°C to dry overnight. Finally, the material was calcined at 1000°C for 8h to form the pyrochlore crystal phase. Catalysts with four different loading levels of Rh were prepared (Table 1 ). 2.2 Catalyst characterization Prior to catalytic testing, material characterization was performed on each of the catalyst powders. BET surface area was determined by N2 adsorption experiments performed at 77K using Micromeritics ASAP-2020 unit. Catalyst samples were vacuum-degassed at 300°C for 10h to remove surface humidity and pre-adsorbed gases before exposure to adsorption gas. The bulk Rh concentration for each catalyst was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) optical emission spectroscopy on a Perkin-Elmer Optima 3000 ICP-OES spectrometer. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and hydrogen pulse chemisorption (H2PC) tests were conducted in a Micromeritics ASAP 2910. Approximately 200mg of each catalyst were loaded into the sample tube, and were reduced under 5vol.% H2/Ar balance (25sccm) from 30 to 900°C with a ramp rate of 10°C/min. The H2PC measurements were conducted after the TPR at 50°C. The same gas mixture was pulsed over the samples every 2min to determine the H2 uptake on the reduced metal sites. A 1:1 molar ratio of atomic H to metal was assumed to quantify H2 dissociation. The crystalline phases present in each sample were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a PANalytical X’Pert PRO model XRD utilizing filtered Cu Kα radiation. Peak identification of the X-ray data was performed using X’pert High Score Plus 2.1 software. 2.3 Carbon formation study 2.3.1 Catalytic partial oxidation test Reaction studies were carried out in a laboratory-scale fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor system. 0.49g of catalyst (−10/+40mesh) were diluted with quartz sand (5:1 by mass) to a volume of 3mL. This was done to avoid channeling and to minimize temperature gradients. The catalysts were loaded into the reactor as prepared, with no pretreatment or reduction. The catalyst bed was placed in a tubular reactor (8mm i.d.) with a coaxially centered thermocouple at the center of the bed. Nitrogen and air flows were delivered by mass flow controllers, and the liquid fuel feed was delivered by a high accuracy ISCO syringe pump. Additional details and a reactor schematic are provided elsewhere [38]. Partial oxidation experiments were conducted isothermally with a center bed temperature of 900°C and a pressure of 0.23MPa. Each catalyst was tested for 4h under a flow of n-tetradecane (TD), a diesel surrogate, with added sulfur specie, dibenzothiophene (DBT), and aromatic specie, 1-methylnaphthalene (MN), representing major contaminants in diesel fuel, and air (O/C=1.25). The flows and conditions of the experiments are summarized in Table 2 . After the three catalysts with different weight loadings were tested, the LCZR2Y catalyst was tested in three additional runs for 2, 4, and 18h. 2.3.2 Temperature programmed oxidation The carbon formed during reaction was studied by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) of the catalyst and bed material (quartz sand) together in the reactor. TPO was performed by introducing a gas stream of 10% O2/N2 into the reactor and was ramped from 250 to 750°C with a temperature ramp rate of 0.5°C/min for the 4h runs on catalysts with different Rh weight loadings. A ramp rate of 0.2°C/min was used for the study of the effect of time on stream using the 2wt% Rh catalyst (LCZR2Y). Carbon dioxide evolution was measured continuously by a mass spectrometer, and the total carbon that had been deposited in the bed was calculated by integration of the carbon dioxide flow rate exiting the reactor. 2.3.3 Raman spectroscopy A Renishaw InVia Raman Microscope with 1.0cm−1 resolution was used to collect the Raman spectra of the spent samples. The samples were excited using a 532nm continuous wave green laser (Crystal 532-100). A 5× magnification microscope objective was used in the experiments. The numerical aperture size of the objective was 0.12. The experimental laser spot size was measured using a calibration slide and was determined to be 13μm. 2.4 Product analysis The gases (hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane) were analyzed using a 200amu scanning magnetic sector mass spectrometer (Thermo ONIX, model no. Prima δb). Oxygen conversion was complete during all experiments. Although water was produced in the reaction, it was not quantitatively analyzed. Carbon balances were typically within 100±5%. Yield of product A (hydrogen) is defined as: Yield of A ( % ) = moles of A produced × 100 N × moles of hydrocarbon fed to the reactor where N is the number of moles of hydrogen/mole of hydrocarbon. The conversion of hydrocarbons (or carbon balance) is defined as: Conv ( % ) = CO + CO 2 + ∑ i i = 1 − 7 i C i H r × 100 N × moles of hydrocarbon fed to the reactor In this equation N is the number of moles of carbon/mole of hydrocarbon. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 Temperature programmed reduction The TPR results for all four catalysts are plotted in Fig. 1 . One high temperature peak, between 460 and 500°C, was common for all materials, and was the largest peak for each sample. An un-doped lanthanum zirconate (LZ) was reported to produce a similar high temperature reduction peak at 527°C [21], and can be attributed to the reduction of the zirconium in the oxide structure. This peak is significantly larger for the Rh-substituted catalysts compared to the LCZY. This suggests that the Rh is associated with the Zr sites in the pyrochlore structure. In addition to the high temperature peak a small shoulder was observed at 415°C for LCZR1Y. At higher Rh loadings (LCZR2Y/LCZR3Y), in addition to an increase in the high temperature peak, two types of Rh sites were observed, identified by reduction peaks located at 205/225°C and 350/360°C. The most reducible Rh site (205/225°C) is not present in LCZR1Y, and is likely from the reduction of rhodium oxide on the pyrochlore surface. There is a theoretical limit to the level of substitution for a given metal in a pyrochlore structure, which is determined by the ratio of the ionic radii of the A- and B-site metals [28]. Excess Rh may form a secondary phase and/or deposit as an oxide on the pyrochlore surface. No peaks were observed around 100°C, which would be associated with a simple supported Rh site [39–41]. 3.1.2 Hydrogen pulse chemisorption After reduction, hydrogen pulse chemisorption was performed on each sample to determine metal dispersion and particle size. Dispersion numbers were consistent with previously reported results for similar substituted pyrochlores [21]. The results of this characterization, as well as ICP results, are presented in Table 3 . As the Rh loading increased, total dispersion decreased and average particle size increased. It is proposed that as the Rh loading increased, the pyrochlore crystal structure became saturated, and the excess Rh likely formed a secondary oxide phase with larger particles, consistent with the results in Table 3. 3.1.3 X-ray powder diffraction The XRD patterns for the four pyrochlore materials show that the desired crystal structure was obtained. The most interesting difference in these samples is the emergence and increase in the peak at ca. 31.5° as the Rh content increased. This peak is associated with a second crystal phase, presumably a LaRhO3 perovskite (JCPDS:10-0305). The Rh associated with this phase is also believed to correspond to the reduction peak observed ca. 350/360°C in the TPR for LCZR2Y/LCZR3Y (Fig. 1). Although no peak shift was observed with increasing Rh substitution, it is important to note that the B-site (Zr) of the pyrochlore is also substituted with 4wt% of Y, which has a much larger ionic radius (0.90Å) than both Rh and Zr (0.60 and 0.72Å, respectively), and would therefore have a more significant effect on the crystal structure and peak locations. Further, since some portion of the Rh is located in a secondary (perovskite) phase its impact on the pyrochlore crystal lattice is reduced. The excess Rh is more stable in the secondary phase than in the already strained primary (pyrochlore) phase (Fig. 2 ). In order to examine the crystal structure further the LCZR2Y sample was scanned by XRD after being reduced with H2 at 200, 350, and 900°C, at which Fig. 1 shows reduction peaks in the TPR experiments. Although the final temperature was much higher than the third reduction peak (460°C), no peaks were observed beyond this temperature. The results of these scans are presented in Fig. 3 . There was no observable difference in the spectra obtained for the two samples reduced at 200 and 350°C. However, the sample reduced at 900°C showed a significant decrease in the peak located ca. 31.5°, associated with hydrogen reduction of the LaRhO3 perovskite phase. This gives additional evidence for the conclusion that this phase corresponds to the reduction peak observed at 350°C in the TPR. Therefore, this indicates that under the reducing atmosphere produced by the reaction conditions the perovskite phase decomposes, presumably allowing more Rh to participate in the reforming reaction in addition to the Rh in the pyrochlore phase. 3.2 Carbon formation study 3.2.1 Catalytic partial oxidation of TD Fig. 4 shows the product yields during the 18-h POX of TD conducted on the LCZR2Y catalyst. This product distribution is near equilibrium values [42] and the carbon balance was determined to be 100±5% throughout the run. The conditions of this experiment were selected to produce a steady state performance with little to no catalyst deactivation. The reason for this was to focus on the carbon formed kinetically over time on the metallic sites rather than on the oxide surface. In order to achieve this, the reaction conditions needed to be outside the limits that thermodynamically favor carbon formation (e.g. lower temperature, lower O/C). Additionally, the rate of carbon formation needed to be slow enough for reasonable reaction time intervals before performing the TPO. All reaction tests on the Rh containing catalysts produced the same product distribution throughout the duration of the experiments. The LCZY catalyst had very poor product yields (H2 =20.9%, CO=31.6%, CO2 =31.1%, CH4 =10.7%), only slightly higher than yields produced in a blank reactor. 3.2.2 Effect of Rh loading After reaction testing, a temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) was performed on each catalyst to analyze the type and quantity of deposited carbon deposited on the surface. The CO2 formed for each catalyst is plotted in Fig. 5 . Three TPO peaks in the temperature range of 300–550°C were observed for the Rh-substituted catalysts. This low-temperature carbon (LTC) is likely deposited on surface sites with a more metallic nature. These peaks are not present with the un-substituted material (LCZY), which produced one very large peak above 550°C that began burning off at ca. 370°C. More stable, graphitic carbon, which burns off at higher temperatures (HTC), is typically associated with the inert oxide catalyst surfaces, or inert material in the catalyst bed. The formation of this type of carbon will be the focus of a future study. The first LTC peak is seen ca. 410–420°C for the LCZR2Y and LCZR3Y catalysts, but it is not clear if this peak is present for LCZR1Y due to the contribution of HTC peak (above 550°C). Each Rh-substituted catalyst produced two additional peaks ca. 480 and 550°C. These carbon species are possibly associated with less metallic Rh sites that are more strongly associated with the oxide crystal structure. Table 4 provides the amount of carbon calculated from the TPO from 250 to 550°C (LTC) for each catalyst calculated by integration of the CO2 plots. The values calculated from straight integration of the curves in Fig. 5 suggest that the LTC decreases with increasing Rh substitution. However, some of the carbon burning off below 550°C is from the simultaneous burn off of carbon that reaches its peak above 600°C. Therefore, the apparent decrease in LTC is possibly reflective of a decrease in deposition of higher temperature carbon at higher Rh-substitution. Origin (OriginLab, Northampton, MA) peak fitting software was used to deconvolute the peaks in each TPO in order to subtract out the contribution of higher temperature burning carbon from the LTC, and these calculated values are provided in the second column. These values for LTC show a different trend, which would be more expected. As Rh substitution increased the adjusted amount of LTC deposition increases. Further, when this carbon is normalized with the number of reducible sites reported in Table 3, the LTC increases as well with higher substitution. This could be explained by the fact that the particle size (also reported in Table 3) increases with substitution, and it is known that larger particles are more susceptible to carbon deposition [43]. Overall, the difference in LTC formation for the different catalysts was not significant. However, the Rh loading level did affect the overall amount of carbon deposited; higher Rh content produced significantly lower carbon. This can be explained by a greater conversion of the adsorbed hydrocarbons into CO instead of remaining on the catalyst surface to form carbon deposits. 3.2.3 Effect of reaction time Reaction tests were conducted for different TOS (2, 4, and 18h) with the LCZR2Y catalyst. The TPO plots for these runs are provided in Fig. 6 . Again, three burn-off peaks were observed. The temperature ramp rate was decreased from 0.5 to 0.2°C/min for better peak separation. This also resulted in a shifting of all the peaks to lower temperatures (360, 400, and 440°C) than seen in the previous TPO for LCZR2Y (Fig. 5). The difference in the amount of carbon calculated from the three peaks for each run time was not significant (28, 25, and 29mg, respectively). Only the burn-off peak above 500°C, not examined here, increases over time. These results, coupled with the fact that there was no observable decrease in the POX reaction over 18h TOS (Fig. 4), suggest that the more reactive carbon accumulates at/near the Rh sites, allowing it to oxidize more readily (i.e. at T <460°C). However, this carbon does not apparently irreversibly block the Rh sites, since there is no observed decrease in POX conversion. Less reactive carbon (TPO>460°C), likely accumulates near, but not on, the Rh sites, clearly visible in the 18-h runs, but less obvious in the 2- and 4-h TPOs. The progress of carbon deposition appears to start at/near the Rh site, after which less oxidizable carbon, further from the Rh sites, populates the remaining sites. This result is consistent with other results in literature [4], which showed carbon accumulation only on the catalyst support after a short period of time. At longer reaction times, the accumulation of higher temperature carbon is expected to continue, ultimately leading to catalyst deactivation. Therefore, to increase resistance to deactivation, approaches to mitigate the formation of this type of carbon could be considered. These approaches may include substitution of different dopants into the pyrochlore structure, addition of surface promoters, or the addition of an oxygen-conducting support. 3.2.4 Characterization of carbon type and partial burn-off Fig. 7 shows the Raman spectra for a spent LCZR2Y after 4h TOS. After reaction, the catalyst was removed from the reactor without performing a TPO, and separated from the inert bed material (quartz sand). The catalyst was separated into three samples. One of the samples was heat treated in air at 440°C to burn off a portion of the LTC. A second sample was heated in air to 700°C, the temperature at which all carbon was observed to burn off (Fig. 5). The third sample was not treated. For the spent sample and the partially burned off sample, both graphitic (G band) and polycrystalline (D band) carbon are seen at 1597 and 1356cm−1, respectively; however, there is no significant difference in the spectra of these two samples. The LTC may be amorphous carbon around 400cm−1, which has a decrease in intensity after the burnoff at 450°C. However, the total amount of this carbon is much less compared to the HTC carbon. 4 Conclusions Mixed-metal oxides substituted with metals that are catalytically active for hydrocarbon reforming demonstrate significantly different surface properties and catalytic performance over simple supported metal catalysts. In this study, Rh-substituted pyrochlores with three different weight loadings (1, 2, or 3wt% Rh) produced three reduction peaks during a TPR, all of which occurred at much higher temperatures than the single reduction peak of a simple Rh metal deposited on a support. Increasing the level of Rh substitution from 0 to 3% led to the formation and growth of the lowest temperature reduction peak. It is proposed that higher substitution levels lead to secondary oxide phases, supported by the XRD spectra. At high enough Rh loading, large clusters of unsubstituted rhodium oxides can form, which would perform more like a simple supported catalyst. These observations lead to the consideration that carbon deposition on the three reducible sites during reaction could also impact the catalytic performance differently than with a pure metallic site on a support. Therefore, POX of TD followed by TPO of the pyrochlore catalysts were conducted to study the type and quantity of the low temperature carbon (T <460°C) deposited on the catalyst surface. Three temperature burn-off peaks were observed in this region for each substituted catalyst, and all were attributed to carbon deposited on Rh sites. Two high temperature burn-off peaks (T >460°C) were observed for all catalysts, and were attributed to stable, graphitic carbon deposited on the inert surfaces of the catalyst and/or the inert bed material in the reactor. Ultimately, it was observed that carbon did not accumulate on the catalytically active sites; however, the more stable carbon that burned off at relatively high temperatures did increase with TOS. This result is consistent with previous studies with supported metal catalysts, where carbon accumulated only on the support, and not on the deposited metal sites. However, this similarity does not identify how carbon accumulating on a substituted oxide surface differs from a simple oxide support, and whether or not this accumulation ultimately leads to catalyst deactivation. A follow up to this study will focus on the accumulating carbon on the same Rh-substituted pyrochlore for extended reaction times, and TPO to higher temperatures. Further recommended studies include studying how different dopants in the A- and B-sites of a pyrochlore impact the deposition of the high-temperature carbon. Finally, the addition of an oxygen-conducting phase to the pyrochlore catalyst should be examined for its impact on carbon deposition as well.

The catalysts underwent a variety of pre- and post-reaction characterization with a focus on deposited carbon, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation. To assess the nature of potential catalytic sites (typically attributed to Rh), each substituted catalyst produced three temperature programmed reduction peaks, with an increase in the most reducible sites at higher Rh loadings. In additions, the catalysts with 2 and 3wt% Rh substitution displayed a secondary crystal phase in their XRD spectra; however, this phase disappeared when the sample was reduced up to 900°C, representative of reaction conditions. To assess carbon deposition after reaction testing, a temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) was conducted on each sample from 250 to 750°C. Each sample produced three CO2 peaks between 250 and 550°C, referred to as low temperature carbon (LTC) peaks, and two peaks at higher temperatures (>600°C). The 2wt% catalyst was run for different times under POX of TD, and the TPO results showed that the amount of LTC reached a steady state within 2h and did not increase even up to 18h under reaction conditions. This indicates that the LTC is not likely responsible for catalyst deactivation. In contrast, the quantity of carbon associated with the higher temperature peaks under TPO increased with reaction time. The carbon associated with the high temperature peaks was highly graphitic, and is typically attributed to deposits on the catalyst inert surfaces and/or inert bed material. After a partial burn-off of the LTC, Raman analysis showed no significant change in the surface carbon. These results suggest that improvement in catalyst performance may be accomplished by modification of the catalyst formulation to increase the resistance to carbon formation on the oxide surface. Such modifications include surface promoters, B-site dopant level, and addition of an oxygen-conducting support. Future work will explore these approaches.",
