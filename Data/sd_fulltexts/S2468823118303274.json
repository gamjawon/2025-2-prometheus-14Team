Graphical abstract Catalytic epoxidation of alkenes plays an essential role in the transformation and synthesis of many organic chemicals. Ti atoms grafted on mesoporous silica, silylated on the surface, is considered the most active and selective catalyst for these reactions. However, the durability and robustness of the active centers remain as the main drawback in industry. In this paper, the characterization of industrial samples is combined with DFT calculations to rationalize the deactivation process of the catalyst and improve its performance. Silylating agents are characterized by experimental and simulated 29Si-NMR and their role in the catalytic mechanism is analysed. Potential deactivation processes are identified before, during and after the reaction. Modifications of the silylating agents and of the active center are proposed to improve the durability of the catalyst. Keywords Epoxidation Titanium Silica DFT Silylation Alkenes Introduction Selective catalytic epoxidation plays a critical role in the transformation and synthesis of many organic chemicals [1,2]. Particularly important among these is the epoxidation of alkenes. During the last decades, significant progress was achieved in this field with the use of Ti-SiO2 catalysts [3]. Titanium-substituted zeolites such as TS-1 or Ti-β are good examples of very active catalysts for the selective oxidation of a wide range of organic compounds in the presence of hydrogen peroxide [4,5]. In these systems, isolated tetracoordinated titanium atoms are embedded in a hydrophobic framework of MFI silicate exhibiting great catalytic properties not only for the epoxidation, but also for oxidation and hydroxylation reactions [6]. However, the performance of these catalysts is drastically reduced by bulky or large organic molecules whose access to the small cavities or channels of these zeolites is limited. The use of other frameworks Ti-substituted mesoporous silicates such as Ti-MCM-41 [7,8], Ti-HMS [9,10], and Ti-SBA-15 [11,12] gives an alternative for the oxidation of larger substrates. These mesoporous molecular sieves present larger pore sizes, which facilitate the interaction between the molecule and the active centers [13,14]. However, the mesoporous materials exhibit lower activities for epoxidation reaction than the former microporous MFI titanium silicates [15,16]. The hydrophilic nature of the Ti-isomorphous substituted mesoporous silica catalyst seems to be the main reason for their low activity [17]. New synthetic routes have improved the performance of this family of catalysts. For example, Ti (IV) ions grafted onto mesoporous silica presents a higher activity than Ti framework embedded systems [18]. The greater accessibility of the grafted metal was pointed as the key factor for its activity [19,20]. Nevertheless, the use of non-aqueous oxidants results crucial to obtain a satisfactory activity. This requirement collides with the industrial use of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant that yields an environmentally friendly by-product, H2O [21]. For this reason, the enhancement of the surface hydrophobicity should be addressed to improve the activity and reduce the Ti leaching [8,16,22,23]. The surface hydrophobicity also regulates other processes such as the product hydrolysis and the diffusion of the substrates through the pores [24]. The functionalization of the surface serves as a straightforward procedure to substitute the hydroxyl groups on the silica surface by other groups that facilitate the absorption of the organic reactants [25,26]. The silylation of the surface is the most common technique used to increase the surface hydrophobicity and to boost the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Different approaches have been proposed to optimize the functionalization process, including the postsynthesis modification of the surface with different silylating agents [16,22,23] and the direct functionalization during the synthesis using mono or dialkylsilanes [27,28]. Although it is clear that silylation increases the selectivity of the catalyst, durability remains as the main challenge to tackle. The enhancement of the stability of the silylating agents in the operational conditions is seen as the key to retard the Ti leaching, increase the lifetime and improve the performance of these catalysts. Although many experimental and theoretical works have been directed towards the improvement of catalysts efficiency and selectivity, to the best of our knowledge no study has focused on the reactions that result on Ti leaching and deactivate the catalysts. In the present work, we will investigate the stability and deactivation of the active centers in the Ti/SiO2 system for the epoxidation of alkenes in operational conditions using experimental techniques and first principles calculations. The active centers of the catalyst have been characterized in different samples before and after their use. Computational models are built based on the available experimental data. The reaction mechanism is explored to identify critical steps in which the catalyst can be deactivated. Finally, different strategies are proposed to reduce the Ti leaching in the system and improve the durability of the catalyst. Experimental section Synthesis Aerolyst® 3041 is used as oxide support for the catalyst. The substrate is pretreated with HCl 4 M during 4 h at 70 °C to improve the activity of the catalyst and then washed to remove the excess of chlorides. Ti is grafted on the surface by vapor deposition of TiCl4 in a N2 stream at 200 °C and calcination at 500 °C. The surface is hydrolyzed to remove the chloride linked to the Ti atoms and enhance the silylation process at 200 °C. HDMS is used as silylating agent using toluene as solvent. This reaction takes place at 110 °C during 3 h. The catalyst is used in a fixed-bed reactor for the epoxidation reaction during 800 h at 65 °C. Catalyst characterization 29Si NMR spectra of the samples were recorded on a Bruker Avance II WB 600 MHz at a spinning rate of 5 kHz. The number of scans for collecting the single-pulse spectra was between 570 and 800. Computational details Cluster models 29Si NMR spectra simulation and reaction mechanism are explored using a cluster model. A 3-ring Si3O6 structure is used as the main component of the cluster creating a tripodal structure for the Ti atom [29,30]. All silicon atoms present tetrahedral coordination through oxygen atoms. Three of the undercoordinated oxygen atoms are saturated with SiH3 moieties while the other three O atoms, that simulate the surface of the catalyst, are coordinated to a Ti atom, silanol groups or H depending on the model (Fig. 1 ). This cluster was selected because: i) the 3-ring Si3O6 structure perfectly mimics the (111) plane of SiO2 β-cristobalite; ii) It is possible to create a tripodal site for the adsorption of the Ti atom; iii) It does not increase the computational cost too much compared to the minimum size cluster. For the cluster model, we used the hybrid Becke3LYP [31–33] functional with a hybrid Becke exchange functional and a Lee-Yang-Parr correlation functional [31,32] as implemented in Gaussian09 [34]. The Ti atom was described using an effective core potential for the inner electrons and its associated triple-ζ basis set for the outer ones [35–37]. The 6-311G(d,p) basis set was used for the atoms H, C, Si, and O [38]. The structures of the reactants, intermediates, transition states, and products were fully optimized without any symmetry restriction. Transition states were identified by having one imaginary frequency. The presented energies for the reaction mechanism correspond to potential energies corrected with zero-point energies. Periodic models Thermochemistry of deactivation processes, hydrolysis, and alcoholysis, are studied with a periodic model. A 2 × 2 supercell slab of the (111) plane of β-cristobalite polymorph is used as periodic surface model [39]. There are 4 terminal oxygen atoms on each surface of the slab. While oxygens are fully saturated with silanol groups on one surface (Surface 2 in Fig. 2 ), Ti is coordinated to three of them on the other surface and the fourth one is saturated with another silanol group (Surface 1 in Fig. 2). In order to avoid artificial interactions between both surfaces, a 10 Å vacuum was added to the model. The Ti tetrahedral coordination sphere is completed with another silanol group. All periodic calculations were performed using the VASP code [40–42] with the projector-augmented wave method (PAW) [43,44]. The energies were computed using the exchange-correlation functional developed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof, PBE [45], based on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Electronic states were expanded using a plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 400 eV. Because of the size of the slab, all the calculations were performed using only the Γ point of the Brillouin zone. Forces were calculated through the Hellmann–Feynman theorem, including the Harris–Foulkes correction to the forces [46]. Iterative relaxation of the atomic positions and lattice parameters was stopped when the forces on the atoms were less than 0.02 eV/Å. Solvent effects were included using VASPsol [47,48]. The accurate description of dispersion forces could be crucial when bulky molecules are adsorbed or at high surface coverage. Although small reactants and a coverage below 0.25 ML are used in the periodic model, we have tested the effects of D3 dispersion corrections [49] in the hydrolysis reaction energies calculations. Energy differences below 1.2 kcal mol−1 were found when compared with the plain PBE functional. Results and discussion Si NMR spectra The noise at the 29Si NMR spectra (Fig. 3 ) makes difficult the quantification or deconvolution of the signals. However, the combination of the spectra at different experimental conditions with the simulated spectra and other previous experimental studies [14,50,51] give us enough information to extract some qualitative conclusions. The 29Si NMR spectra of the non-silylated sample (Fig. 3) shows a broad asymmetric peak at δ −107 ppm (Q1 species) with a shoulder and tail around δ −95 to −103 ppm (Q2) which have been attributed to Si(OSi)4, HOSi(OSi)3, and (HO)2Si(OSi)2 respectively [14,50,51]. The silylation of the samples produce two main effects in the spectra, i) the broad peak at δ −107 ppm looks more asymmetric and ii) the appearance of a new peak between δ 15–20 ppm (Q3 species) that corresponds to the Si atoms of the trimethylsilyl group (XO)Si(CH3)3. This behavior is consistent with the silylation of the surface replacing the hydroxyl groups by the trimethylsilyl groups. This process seems to be reverted during operating conditions. For the used sample, the peak at δ 15–20 ppm disappears and the main signal gets sharper and symmetric again. Although there are not Si(OSi)4 species in the cluster models, it is possible to compare the experimental NMR spectra with the chemical shifts obtained from the calculations (Table 1 ). The shoulder and tail of the spectra that were assigned as HOSi(OSi)3, and (HO)2Si(OSi)2 matches with the chemical shift for XOSi(OSi)3 in the clusters. However, the most important signals to characterize the active centers and the deactivation process are between δ 25 and 15 ppm. The computed chemical shifts for XOSi(CH3)3 are in good agreement with the experimental peaks at δ 15–20 ppm for the silanol groups. The resolution of the experimental spectra is not enough to differentiate between the silanol groups coordinated to Ti or Si atoms of the surface, however, it is clear that this signal disappears after the use of the catalyst. Hydrolysis and alcoholysis The loss of the TiO(surface) bonds caused by the presence of water or alcohols, byproducts of the reaction, is a process that can reduce the dispersion of Ti atoms and facilitates the Ti leaching. In the case of the hydrolysis (Scheme 1 ), the loss of the first TiO(surface) bond (H1) is exothermic by 7.6 kcal mol−1. Even more important, the hydrolyzation of a second TiO bond (H2) is also exothermic by 6.7 kcal mol−1. However, the presence of water is only considered if H2O2 is used as the main oxidant. If an organic hydroperoxide such as ROOH is used as an oxidant in the reaction, its byproduct, ROH, will be the main agent able to hydrolyze the TiO bond. Two different alcohols are used to study the thermochemistry of the alcoholysis, i) methanol was selected as the most simple candidate and ii) methylbencyl alcohol, MBA, as it is the byproduct for propylene oxidation using ethylbenzene hydroperoxide in industry [52,53]. Two different products were considered during the alcoholysis reaction. The OR group can be bonded to the Ti atom, adduct A, or to the surface, adduct B (see Scheme 2 ). Reaction enthalpies show a very different behavior for both alcohols (Table 2 ). While the alcoholysis of methanol is thermodynamically preferred, MBA alcoholysis is quite endothermic. However, adduct B is more stable than adduct A in both cases. This demonstrates that the use of small aliphatic peroxides is not recommended because of the potential deactivation of the active centers. Alcoholysis reaction energies were also explored including solvent effects (Table 2) in order to study its influence on the reactivity of the active center. Reaction enthalpies slightly change (less than 4 kcal mol−1) and the same trends and conclusions can be extracted with acetonitrile (a frequently used solvent for this reaction) or with a very polar solvent such as water. Because of the lack of influence of the solvent on these results, solvents effects were not included in the remaining calculations to reduce the required computational resources. Proton parking Using as a starting point previous studies focused on the reaction mechanism of the catalytic epoxidation of alkenes and its selectivity [54–60]. We want to explore the catalytic cycle from a different perspective highlighting the reactions that can deactivate the system and produce the Ti leaching. Hydrolysis and alcoholysis can take place before, during, or after the reaction but there are other potential deactivation processes that are exclusively related to the catalytic pathway. Proton parking is the first of them. The most accepted mechanism for this reaction describes the existence of an initial active center, Ti(η2-OOR). The formation of this complex requires the deprotonation of the hydroperoxide compound that is also described as proton parking. The main issue of this step is the potential hydrolyzation of TiO bonds that plays an important role in the stability of the catalyst. On one hand, the proton parking can hydrolyze the bond between the Ti atom and the silanol group and on the other, this deprotonation process can potentially result in the loss of the Ti-surface bond (Scheme 2). Computed reaction energies, ΔE, and kinetic barriers, Ea, for the formation of both products in gas phase are presented in Table 3 . Despite both pathways presenting considerably low barriers, a reduction of both barriers is expected in a condensed phase. While the barriers do not show a preferential pathway from a kinetic point of view, reaction energies point the hydrolyzation of the Ti-surface bond as the most likely event. This trend demonstrates a gradual destabilization of the active centers grafted to the surface that can derive in the experimentally observed Ti-leaching. Based on these results, the redirection of the proton parking seems important to increase the stability of the catalyst. The silylating agent can be funtionalized to stabilize thermodynamically the adduct A and compete with the hydrolyzation of TiO bonds of the surface. We have substituted one of the methyl groups of the thimethyl silanol molecule to modify the basicity of that oxygen and favor the adduct A. Table 4 shows the reaction energies for different substituents, R’. Most of the substituents present reaction energies even larger than the methyl group, nevertheless, slightly improvements are obtained for H or the CH2NO2 group as substituents. These findings are in agreement with experimental results which have demonstrated that dimethylsilyl groups improve the silylation degree and the efficiency of the catalyst with respect to trimethylsilyl groups [61]. The modified substituents, R’, modify the basicity of the O atom of the silanol group linked to the titanium. This can reduce the acidity of the Ti atom, which is detrimental to the activity of the catalyst. However, including substituents with their own basic center provides an alternative strategy that does not modify the activity of the Ti atom. This approach presents advantages with respect to the other two pathways. The hydrolyzation of the silanol groups promotes a loss of the hydrophobicity of the surface. If the proton parking takes place in the basic center of a substituent group, the silanol is not hydrolyzed and keeps protecting the active center. A methylpyridine (CH3Py) is proposed as possible substituent of the silanol. Although this substituent acts as a base taking the proton of the hydroperoxide, the process is endothermic (6.6 kcal mol−1). Reaction mechanism Epoxidation reaction mechanism has been previously characterized and studied, identifying both the reactive centers and main kinetic barriers [54–56]. As it was mentioned in the introduction, the primary goal of this paper is pointing out the main deactivation processes and finding possible modifications that may result in a more robust catalytic system. Two different catalytic cycles have been proposed because of the two main sites for the proton parking. We label the mechanism as “Surf” when the proton parking hydrolyzes one of the Ti-surface bonds and as “Sil” when the silanol-Ti bond is hydrolyzed (Scheme 3 ). “Surf” mechanism should be the main route because the proton parking is thermodynamically favored with respect to the “Sil” mechanism. However, “Surf” mechanism profile presents a high barrier for the loss of the peroxo, OO, bond, around 32 kcal mol−1. This value is close to the barriers predicted by other authors as the rate limiting step in the epoxidation with Ti in polyoxometalates, 27.3 kcal mol−1 [56]. However, the “Sil” route presents a smoother profile with lower barriers. Once the silanol group traps the H of the hydroperoxo compound and desorbs, the loss of the peroxo bond and the formation of the ethylene oxide is favored. We have found a barrier of only 11 kcal mol−1, considerably lower than the rate limiting step for the “Surf” reaction profile and in agreement with the theoretical and experimental barriers predicted by Jimenez-Lozano et al. [62] (11.6–12.7 kcal mol−1). This barrier is also considerably lower than the barrier calculated for the alkene epoxidation in other systems such as Au/Al2O3 [63]. Modifications on the active site The high barriers and hydrolyzation of Ti-surface bonds make the “Surf” mechanism less desirable than the “Sil” route. Modifications in the silylating agent were proposed to avoid the “Surf” proton parking. Similarly, modifications in the active center can be studied to reduce this channel. Other metals such as Mo, Mn, Nb, or Zr have been proposed as a replacement of Ti for the epoxidation of alkenes [56,64,65]. Here, we will focus on zirconium because of its capability of being coordinated to a larger number of atoms. A comparison of the reaction energies for the different proton parking mechanisms with Ti and Zr as active sites is shown in Table 5 . Although “Surf” route is still thermodynamically the preferential mechanism, the difference between the reaction energies of both proton parking mechanisms is reduced by a factor of approx. 4 with respect to having Ti as the active site. The rate limiting step for the “Sil” route has been also computed using Zr as the active center. The barrier increases 3 kcal mol−1 with respect to the 11 kcal mol−1 of the Ti active site which can be considered a small modification of the reaction profile. When Ti is replaced by Zr, MO bonds are enlarged but there are no important modifications in the geometry that could change the proton parking mechanism (Fig. S1). These findings are in agreement with recent results that reveal that stronger Lewis acids such as Ti give greater turnover rates than Zr [66]. The enhancement of the thermodynamic competition between both proton parking mechanisms predicts that Zr can be a potential candidate to increase the durability of the catalyst and reduce the leaching process. However a trade-off should be made between the strength of the metal as a Lewis acid and the preferential proton parking site. Conclusions The deactivation and durability of Ti-SiO2 catalyst for alkene epoxidation were studied with a combined experimental and theoretical approach. The key role and position of the silylating agents on the surface were identified using experimental and calculated 29Si-NMR spectra. Different chemical descriptors are proposed to explain the deactivation of the catalyst. Hydrolysis and specially alcoholysis are detrimental side reactions for the stability of the catalyst. The multiple mechanisms of the reaction are explored, recognizing the steps that potentially influence on the stability of the active sites. The main channel for the proton parking reaction can be tuned reducing the hydrolysis of the bonds between the Ti atoms and the surface. Functionalization of the silylating agents and the substitution of the metal are the main tools to modify the stability of the catalyst. Substituents on the silylating agent with basic centers redirect the proton parking, avoiding the hydrolyzation of key bonds for the leaching of the metal. The use of Zr instead of Ti reduces the population of the channel in which the bonds between the metal and the surface are constantly hydrolyzed. However, a trade-off should be made between the strength of the metal as a Lewis acid for a high activity and the preferential proton parking site for the durability of the catalyst.
