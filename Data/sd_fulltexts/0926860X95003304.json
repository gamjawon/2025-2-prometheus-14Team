A higher Pt dispersion increases the selectivity toward hydrogenolysis products and overall activity. The % coke after 90 rain on stream at a Hz/n-C4 ratio of 3 was found to be less than 0.1 wt.-% in all cases. The presence of Br~nsted acid sites upon reduction is confirmed by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine. The WO3/ZrO2 (WZ) support consists of a mixture of tetragonal and monoclinic zirconia and tetragonal tungsten oxide regardless of the presence of platinum.

Introduction The area of oxoanion promotion of transition metal oxides such as zirconia (Z), hafnia and titania has been pioneered by Hino and Arata [1]. Strong solid acids are produced by means of sulfate [2-8], tungstate [9] and molybdate [10] addition to the surface of zirconia, resulting in catalytic materials active for alkane isomerization at relatively low temperatures. The most active system for n-butane isomerization is perhaps the iron and manganese promoted sulfated zirconia (FMSZ) [11-15]. Apart from coke fouling, the loss of surface sulfate during calcination, reduction [16] or reaction of sulfate-based catalysts is an * Corresponding author. Tel. (+ 1-402) 4722750, fax.

Larsen et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 201-211 important problem this technology is faced with. For example, when a good hydrogen-activating metal like palladium or platinum is also added to the SZ system, reduction of a fraction of the sulfate to S2- (H2S) leads to both partial loss of the acid function and poisoning of the noble metal [16,17]. In spite of their lower activity, other oxoanions that have less tendency to decompose into gaseous products during oxidation or reduction cycles also appear interesting from a practical viewpoint. Thus, we have turned our atten- tion to the platinum supported on tungsta-promoted zirconia (PtWZ) and studied their catalytic behavior for the reactions of n-butane in the presence of hydrogen at 573 K. The presence of both hydrogen and Pt was a priori expected to result in an improved catalyst stability with respect to the Pt-free system. Two preparation methods were used to investigate the effect of dispersion on catalyst performance. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), diffuse reflectance in- frared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of adsorbed pyridine, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) were used as catalyst characteri- zation tools. 2. Experimental The preparation of WZ was carried out by a procedure similar to that described in Ref. [9]. In brief, a solution of ZrO2C12xH20 (Aldrich) was used to produce hydrous zirconia (HZ) by precipitation upon addition of 30% NH3 (Aldrich) to pH 10. The precipitate was filtered and washed with deionized water until no chloride was detected by the AgNO3 test. The solids were then oven-dried at 373 K for 3 h. The HZ sample was impregnated to incipient wetness with an aqueous solution of ammonium metatungstate to yield a 12 wt.-% W material and subsequently oven-dried at 373 K for 3 h. At this point, one third of this dried material was impregnated with an aqueous solution of PtC16Hz.xH20 from Aldrich (38-40 wt.-% Pt) to yield a 1.2 wt.-% Pt solid. This Pt- and tungstate-loaded sample was calcined at 1096 K for 1 h in a quartz U-tube under an air flow of 1 1/min g. The calcination temperature was achieved by applying a 13.3 K/min ramp. The sample was labeled as PtWZ (Std) and stored until use. The remaining oven-dried portion of the tungstate-im- pregnated solid was calcined using exactly the same protocol as in PtWZ (Std). The calcined sample was divided in two equal portions. One of them was labeled as WZ (Pt-free sample) and stored until use. The remaining portion was impregnated several times with an ether solution of platinum acetylacetonate from Strem Chemicals until the desired Pt wt.-% was reached (1.2 wt.-%). This sample was labeled as PtWZ (acac) and stored in a closed vial. Finally, a y-A1203 (A) support from Strem Chemicals was subjected to the same aqueous Pt loading and calcination protocol as in PtWZ (Std) to produce a reference catalyst. Prior to reaction, all samples were calcined for 1 h at the chosen G. Larsen et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 201-211 203 temperature (1096 K for WZ, Pt/A1203 and Pt/WZ (Std), and 773 K for Pt/WZ (acac)) and subsequently reduced for 1 h under a H2 flOW of 0.5 l/ min g at 623 K. The choice of temperature for the second calcination cycle of the Pt/WZ (acac) sample is not in any way arbitrary. Preliminary temperature-pro- grammed experiments revealed that traces of water are eliminated above 723 K, a fact that guarantees the presence of only comparable amounts of water of reduction in all samples prior to reaction. Carbon monoxide chemisorption was performed in a conventional Pyrex volumetric system using standard static methods. The adsorption set-up is equipped with a Baratronpressure transducer, greaseless stopcocks and me- chanical and diffusion pumps. Electron microscopy studies were done in the bright field mode with a JEOL JEM2010 microscope at 200 keV beam energy. The XRD measurements were performed on a Rigaku DMAX/IIB diffractometer (with Cu K ~ radiation of 1.5418 A). The spectra were recorded between 20= 20and 20= 80and scanning at a rate of 0.8min. A conventional atmospheric, gas-phase stainless-steel flow reaction system equipped with Brooks 5850 mass-flow controllers was used for the kinetic runs. For reaction order measurements, a third flow of pure nitrogen was also used for balancing purposes. Gas chromatographic (GC) quantification of products was carried out with a Hewlett-Packard 5880 GC equipped with a 50-m fused-silica capillary column coated with methyl silicone. The catalyst bed (100 mg) was placed in a 6-mm i.d. quartz U-tube with an ce-A1203 (1-2 mZ/g) packing as preheating bed. The catalysts had previously been pelletized, followed by crushing and sieving to collect the 20-40 mesh fraction. The temperature was controlled externally to +0.5 K. Total conversions were kept around or below 2% to ensure reactor operation under differential regimes as well as a compari- son of catalytic properties at the same conversion levels. For example, the total steady state isomerization % conversion was 0.25 and 0.6 for PtWZ(Std) and PtWZ (acac), respectively. The DRIFTS studies were carried out at different temperatures on a Nicolet 20 SXB Fourier transform infrared spectrometer equipped with a commercial DRIFTS catalytic chamber and associated optical and temperature control systems from Spectratech The flow reactor part of the cell consists of a temperature-controlled ceramic cup where the catalyst powder is packed. Ultra- high purity nitrogen was passed through an efficient bubbler-saturator assembly kept at room temperature. The catalysts were pretreated in exactly the same fashion as the reactivation protocol for reaction studies. After reduction, the excess hydrogen was purged with pure nitrogen for 0.5 h at 513 K, followed by cooling of the DRIFTS cell at room temperature. An 8-port injection valve was added to a mass-flow controlled stainless-steel reactor manifold similar to that used for reaction studies to allow for pulse injection of pyridine to the freshly reduced catalyst. 204 G. Larsen et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 201-21 l Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments were carried out on samples which had been exposed to the reacting mixture for 90 min at conversion levels in the range 1-2%. In order to measure the very low coke content on the catalysts used in this study, a highly sensitive TPO technique was used. The modified unit converts the CO2 produced during coke oxidation to CH4, using a Ni catalyst. The CH4 is then continuously monitored with a flame ionization detector. This improves both sensitivity and resolution. Details of the technique have been reported [18]. The TPO analyses are performed using 3% O2/N2 flowing at 30 cc/min, while increasing the temperature at 12 K/rain. Sample weight was 20 mg. 3. Results and discussion A representative XRD pattern for these catalysts is shown in Fig. 1. The type of reflections present were not affected by the presence of Pt, reduction or synthetic method, providing the initial catalyst activation temperature (1096 K) was common to all preparations. The low Pt content of our samples (1.2 wt.-%) prevented us from determining structural properties of this metal by XRD. Note that metal concentrations above 4 wt.-% are typically required for accurate XRD analysis. An important feature is that a separate WO3 tetragonal phase is formed, in addition to a mixture of monoclinic and tetragonal zirconia. It was first pointed out by Hino and Arata [9] that calcination temperatures in the 1073-1123 K range were necessary to produce tungstated zirconia catalysts active for alkane isomerization. In the case of sulfate promotion, the stability of the tetragonal phase and the catalyst surface area are known to be additional benefits resulting from the presence of this oxoanion.

Electron microscopy indicated that, unlike on PtWZ (acac), large metal particles (> 10 nm.) were formed upon high-temperature calcination of PtWZ (Std). A minimum set of eight micrographs per catalyst were inspected, but no attempt to statistically determine the average particle size was made. The reason is that we cannot a priori discard the possibility of formation of mixed metal or metal oxide clusters, which would make any attempt to correlate particle size with chemisorption measurements quite tenuous. The micrographs also showed the presence of lattice fringes corresponding to the 111 plane of tetragonal (or 101 monoclinic) ZrO2, and the 001 plane of the monoclinic ZrO2 form. Electron microscopy was not carried out on Pt/A1203, but the presence of Pt as the only transition metal in this sample makes the CO chemisorption data a good tool to get a first estimate of mean crystallite diameter (ca. 3 nm.). Table 1 shows the CO chemisorption results and reaction rates at 573 K. Reaction orders for the isomerization reaction and % coke after 90 min on stream are given in Table 2 (see also Figs. 2 and 3). Straight reaction order lines were not obtained for the hydrogenolysis pathway (Fig. 4). In all cases, a stable activity plateau was reached after about 25 min time on stream (TOS). The reaction order measurements were carried out after this activity plateau was achieved. To avoid transient behavior, reaction order runs were carried out by first stabilizing the conversion at the lowest H2/n-C4 ratio followed by Table 2 Isomerization reaction orders for PtWZ (acac) and PtWZ (Std) and % coke after 90 min on stream ~' Catalyst % Coke b nH _, nn - C'4 1.2 wt.-% Pt/WZ (acac) 0.013 - 0.8 0.9 1.2 wt.-% Pt/WZ (Std) 0.066 - 0.6 1.0 \" 100 mg catalyst beds under a flow of 5 cc/min of n-butane, 15 cc/min H2 and 10 cc/min N2. t' The 1.2 wt.-% Pt/AI203 and WZ catalysts had 0.016 and 0.072 wt.-% coke after reaction. 206 G.

An interesting feature is the negative reaction order in hydrogen for n-butane isomerization in the temperature and pressure ranges used. In addition, the hydrogen partial pressure dependence of the hydrogenolysis reaction follows an opposite trend. Another important aspect is that a lower Pt dispersion seems to be required to suppress the formation of hydrogenolysis products. Note that the Pt/A1203 reference sample only catalyzes the hydrogenolysis pathway, which suggests that small Pt particles may be responsible for this reaction under the present conditions. The hydrogenolysis activity of Pt catalysts decreases with increasing particle size [19,20]. Thus, it is conceivable that the larger Pt particles in PtWZ (Std) are not capable to perform the C-C bond rupture reactions to a significant extent. From Table 1 it is also clear that the presence of Pt increases the isomerization rate on a total catalyst mass basis, but there are at least two different possibilities by which this phenomenon can occur.

Pt/WZ (acac) could be responsible for the difference in the isomerization rates reported in Table 1. Second, it has been proposed for Pt-SO42-/ZrO2 that the metal increases the concentration of Br0nsted acid sites by hydrogen spillover [21], a situation that may also take place in WZ systems. The fact that the Pt-free WZ sample only catalyzed the isomerization of n-butane, coupled with the observation that Pt/A1203 only showed hydrogenolysis activity in this T-P range lead us to think that the former pathway is likely to be primarily catalyzed by the WO3-ZrO2 system, and that the higher isomerization activity of Pt/WZ (acac) may be due to the enhanced ability of this catalyst to function better than Pt/WZ (Std) and WZ in terms of the proposed mechanism in Ref. [21]. Fig. 5 a-c show the pyridine adsorption results. The evolution of bands at 1440-1445, 1630-1640 and 1530-1550 cm-] are indicative of BrCnsted acid- ity, whereas the bands at 1600-1630 cm-~ are assigned to pyridine bonded to I Lewis acid sites. Certain bands such as the 1440-1460 and 1480-1490 cm cannot be univocally attributed to either hydrogen-bonded, protonated or Lewis-coordinated pyridine species. Given the low dispersion of these catalysts, the Pt wt.-% and the relatively high pyridine loadings, we do not expect pyridine adsorption on the metal function to be of importance in the DRIFTS spectra. We chose to use pyridine adsorption at room temperature via pulse addition instead of a TPD approach because on a separate set of experiments we found that WZ decomposes pyridine at high temperatures. Under continuous purging of the DRIFTS cell, spectra labeled as 'A' in Fig. 5a-c represent saturation of the surface, a loading of 90 ___ 25 /xmol pyridine/g found in all three tungsta catalysts. However, the fact that a fraction of pyridine may be weakly bound at room temperature cannot be ruled out here. Nevertheless, an interesting feature revealed by the pyridine DRIFTS experiments is the presence of BrCnsted acidity, which is expected to be due to the presence of water of reduction that did not desorb upon purging of the DRIFTS chamber at 513 K. The relative contribution of the 1530-1550 cm-] (Brcnsted) band to the pyridine DRIFTS 208 G.

However, there is a priori no rational basis for ascribing the higher isomerization activity of this catalyst solely to this spectral feature. The TPO results are shown in Fig. 6 (see also Table 2).

Normally, this represents a negligible contribution to the overall signal but the low coke content of these samples makes it appear relatively large. The adsorbed CO2 signal was not considered for quantification purposes. In general, we expect hydrogen spillover to be more important in samples with higher Pt dispersions, a fact that a priori suggests Pt/WZ (acac) should show the lowest rate of coke formation. Fig. 6 and Table 2 show that Pt/WZ (acac) has both a lower coke content and a lower temperature TPO maximum than Pt/WZ (Std). These two features are typically associated with coke deposits and coke-generating sites being in closer proximity to the metal function. The TPO experiments also indicate that very low dispersions may not prevent coke formation with respect to the Pt-free sample, given the similarities between WZ and Pt/WZ (Std). However, the higher isomerization activity of Pt/WZ (Std) with respect to WZ is still an important advantage. Sachtler et al. [14] have proposed the formation of oligomeric intermediates (C8) on iron- and manganese-promoted SZ. Iglesia et al. [17] proposed that a bifunctional mecha- nism for C 7 isomerization takes place on PtSZ, with Pt mainly participating in the hydrogen transfer reactions. If these mechanisms also hold for the n-butane isomerization pathway on PtWZ, a lower Pt activity should result in longer surface residence times for the oligomeric species, which in turn should translate into increased coke deposition rates. In this scenario, there is a priori no reason to expect that Pt/A1203 and PtWZ(acac) should have similar catalytic proper- ties because of their nearly identical CO uptakes and indeed they behave very differently. In Pt supported on zeolites and for a given zeolite acidity level the isomerization selectivity always increases with increasing Pt particle size [20]. At this point, we should stress the fact that our coking results only reflect 'initial' rates of self-poisoning by this mechanism. From a practical standpoint, 210 G. Larsen et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 201-211 it is customary to rank catalysts according to their long-term performance at higher conversion levels. Such experiments are currently under way. From a fundamental standpoint, the state of Pt after catalyst pretreatment still needs to be addressed. In addition, partial reduction of tungsta is conceivable in the presence of hydrogen and noble metals. By means of hydrogen TPR and X-ray absorption near edge studies at the W Lm edge, we have found that reduction of W occurs in PtWZ (acac) around 750 K, but not on PtWZ (Std) [22]. The hydrogen consumption was found to be consistent with the formation of W4+, and Pt reduction was not affected by the presence of tungsta [22]. The latter can be taken as indication that, after reduction, Pt forms an independent phase in PtWZ (acac), and that it provides activated hydrogen to facilitate tungsta reduction. This could only be accomplished if activated hydrogen were able to diffuse on the surface of the support, a picture that would also be consistent with our proposal that coke formation is decreased with increasing Pt dispersions by the same mechanism. On the practical side, there seems to be a trade-off between dispersion as monitored by CO chemisorption and TEM and isomerization selectivity. The latter decreases but coke deposition (which was in all cases very small) increases with lower dispersions. In addition, the isomerization activity (per unit mass of catalyst) also decreases with lower CO chemisorption uptakes. Research is currently under way to address the fundamental issue of Pt-WOX interaction and the nature of acid site formation. 4. Conclusions Large metallic crystallites (> 10 nm) are formed upon co-impregnation and co-calcination of W and Pt precursors on hydrous ZrO2 and calcination at 1096 K. Lower Pt dispersions result in better n-butane isomerization selectivities. Negative reaction orders in hydrogen and low coke deposition are two of these catalysts most salient features. Pyridine adsorption indicates that BrCnsted acid sites are present upon catalyst pretreatment whether or not Pt is present. The WZ system consists of a mixture of tetragonal and monoclinic zirconia and WO3 upon high-temperature calcination.

A higher Pt dispersion increases the selectivity toward hydrogenolysis products and overall activity. The % coke after 90 min on stream at a H2/n-C4 ratio of 3 was found to be less than 0.1 wt.-% in all cases. The presence of Brønsted acid sites upon reduction is confirmed by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine. The WO3/ZrO2 (WZ) support consists of a mixture of tetragonal and monoclinic zirconia and tetragonal tungsten oxide regardless of the presence of platinum.
