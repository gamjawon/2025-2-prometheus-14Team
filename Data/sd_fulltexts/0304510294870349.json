A. Aramendia, V. Borau, C. Jimenez, J. M. Marinas, A. Porras, F. J. Urbano, L. Villar Departamento de Quimica Organica, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Cordoba, Avda San Alberto Magno s/n, E-14004 Cordoba, Spain Received 13 April 1994; revised 20 June 1994; accepted 21 June 1994 Abstract This paper reviews the use of Spanish sepiolites as supports for Pd catalysts employed for the reduction of variously substituted alkenes, the selective semi-hydrogenation of phenylacetylene and the reduction of acetophenone, both with gaseous hydrogen and by hydrogen transfer with cyclohexene as donor. The performance of Pd/sepiolite catalysts is compared with that of synthesized catalysts supported over SiOz, S'02-AIP04, AIP04 and AIP04-AI203, which we have used extensively, as well as with that of several commercially available catalysts from Fluka, Merck and Degussa. Keywords: Alkenes; Palladium; Reduction; Selectivity; Sepiolites; Supported catalysts 1. Introduction Catalytic hydrogenations by transfer with a variety of hydrogen donors [ 1,2] have been widely used in organic syntheses in the last few years, so much so that they have become major alternatives to conventional catalytic hydrogenations with gas hydrogen in many cases. For some time, our research group has investigated the use of aluminium orthophosphates and Si02-AIP04 and A1203-AIP04 systems as metal supports for preparing heterogeneous reduction catalysts. By supporting Pd on such systems we have prepared excellent catalysts [3-6] that are suitable for transfer reduction processes involving various organic functions. Sepiolites, which are hydrated magnesium silicates consisting of inner channels that can accommodate water and other molecules, readily absorb some gases and vapours [ 7-11 ] and have been used for chromatographic purposes and as catalysts 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

Spain abounds with large deposits of this mineral, which is sold by Tolsa S.A. - hence the great interest in the development of potential applications of this silicate. In this context, our group has used sepiolites both as acid-base catalysts [ 12,13 ] and as supports for metals such as Pd, Pt and Ni [ 14,15 ] in order to obtain active catalysts for reducing aromatic nitro compounds [ 16] and de-protecting N-protected amino acids [ 17 ] . 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalytic supports The sepiolite used was supplied by Tolsa S.A. (Madrid, Spain). Prior to characterization and use, the sample was calcined at 400 C for 4 h in order to obtain SEP400. All other supports were synthesized in our laboratory following procedures described elsewhere [ 18-21 ] . The textural properties of the supports (specific surface area and pore volume and mean radius) were determined from nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at the liquid nitrogen temperature by using a Micromeritics ASAP-2000 instrument [ 18-21 ] . Surface areas were calculated by the BET method [ 22 ] while pore distributions were determined by the BJH method (adsorption branch, cylindrical pores open on one side only and adsorbed layer thickness calculated by the Halsey method). Prior to each determination, the supports were subjected to a specific calcination procedure, placed in an oven at 110 C for 48 h, and then degassed by using a standard procedure. Table 1 shows the name and composition of all the supports used, as well as their textural properties. Table 2 lists the results obtained in the titration of the acid, basic, oxidizing and reducing sites of the supports with cyclohexylamine (CHA), m-nitrobenzoic acid Table 1 Textural properties of the supports System Composition % Weight Gelling agent SeET (N2) a VP r ` F Pure AIP04 100 Ammonia 156 0.49 30 E Si02-AIP04 (80:20) Ethylene oxide 327 0.46 30 PM2 SiOZ-AIP04 (80:20) Propylene oxide 363 0.68 20 P2 Si02-AIPOQ (80:20) Propylene oxide 410 0.54 35 F72 Si02-AIPOQ (80:20) Ammonia 280 0.46 35 S Sioz 100 395 0.55 32 SEP400 280 0.48 35 B Pure AIP04 100 Ethylene oxide 256 0.60 40 CB AlP04-Al2P03 (75:25) Ethylene oxide 263 0.53 30 Specific surface area (m2/g).

All supports were sieved through 200-250 mesh to avoid internal diffusion. The sepiolite support (SEP4oo) was also analysed by X-ray diffraction using a Siemens D500 diffractometer. Fig. 1 shows the diffractogram obtained between 2B= 5 and 28=75. Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) showed the support to possess a fibrous structure that was preserved on calcination at 400 C. 2.2.

The metal was loaded onto the support by impregnation to incipient wetness, using aqueous Na2PdCl4 as precursor. An appropriate volume of aqueous NaOH was added to obtain a Na/Pd ratio of 4:1. The mixture was placed in a Rotavapor for 24 h and evacuated until complete removal of the solvent. The impregnated support was dried at 120 C for 24 h and subsequently calcined at 220 C for 4 h. The reduction process was carried out by using a hydrogen stream at a flow-rate of 120 ml/min and a linearly increasing temperature up to 220 C. After the catalyst was synthesized, it was subjected to programmed thermal analysis by using a Micromeritics TPD-TPR 2900 instrument, furnished with a TCD detector whose output was directly fitted to a VG Sensorlab quadrupole mass spectrometer that allowed monitoring of up to 16 ions in the SIM mode. Based on the programmed thermal reduction (TPR) data obtained, all palladium occurred in its metal form at the reduction temperature used (220 C) . Fig. 2 shows the results of a programmed thermal hydrogen desorption (TPD) experiment involving catalyst Pd3SEP400; the graph shows two distinct desorption maxima at 300 and 490 C. We used the VG Sensorlab mass spectrometer to monitor the ion at m/e=2 and found both peaks to correspond to H2 desorption. The catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a Philips CM-10 microscope. An overall 10 micrographs per catalyst were taken for subsequent examination with the aid of an intelligent artificial viewing system. At least 300 particles per catalyst were characterized. The results obtained were used to construct histograms of appearance frequency and metal surface area as a function of the mean particle size. Fig. 3 shows the histograms obtained for catalyst Pd3SEP4oo. The metal dispersion [defined as (no. Pd surface atoms/overall no. Pd atoms) X 100] for this catalyst was 8% and hence consistent with that found by hydrogen chemisorption. M. A.

Reagents All reagents used in the experiments described below were purchased from Merck or Fluka and were distilled or recrystallized prior to use. 2.4. Product analysis Reaction products were analysed by gas chromatography using high-purity standards. Analyses were carried out on a Hewlett-Packard 5890A gas chromatograph equipped with an HP 3396A integrator. The capillary columns used were a 60 m X 0.32 mm Supelco 2-4046, a 30 m X 0.53 mm Supelco 4-7302 and a Carbowax 20 M X 1 / 8 in model. The last was packed with 10% Carbowax supported on Chromosorb PAW-60/80 as stationary phase. The nature of the products was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry on a Hewlett-Packard 5971A mass selective detector. 2.5. Experimental setup and conditions 2.5.1. Hydrogen-transfer reactions Hydrogen-transfer reductions were carried out in a Berghof Heiz reactor using 5 X 10-3 mol of the substrate to be reduced, 0.05 g of Pd catalyst (3% w/w Pd), 5.9 X 10-3 mol of hydrogen donor (cyclohexene) and enough solvent to make up to 6 ml. The reaction temperature was controlled to within 1 C. The shaking rate used was 1700 rpm, at which external diffusion was under control. Reactions with molecular hydrogen By using a procedure reported elsewhere [ 25 ] , individual and competitive hydrogenation runs were carried out under vigorous shaking in a conventional lowpressure hydrogenator ( Mod. 3911 from Parr Instruments Co.) furnished with a 136 M. A. Aramendia et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994)131-147 manometer which continuously monitored the hydrogen pressure inside the insulated reaction vessel (V= 500 ml). The reaction temperature was controlled to within 0.5 C by circulating water from a thermostatic bath through the vessel jacket. Individual reactions were conducted under essentially constant-volume conditions in 20 ml of a 0.5 M methanol solution of the substrate, at an initial hydrogen pressure of 0.276-0.414 MPa and temperatures between 20 and 45 C. Apparent activation energies were calculated over the temperature range 20-45 C. An amount of catalyst of 0.045 g (3% Pd w/w) was employed throughout. The initial reaction rates for the individual hydrogenations were obtained from the variation of the hydrogen uptake (calculated from the decrease in the hydrogen pressure measured by the manometer) as a function of time. As the plots of the decrease in the hydrogen pressure with time were always linear up to 90% conversion, the determination of the initial slope was straightforward and reproducible to within ca. 6%. For competitive hydrogenations, 20 ml of equimolar mixtures of A and B, 0.25 M each in methanol, were hydrogenated under the same experimental conditions used in the individual hydrogenations. Reactions were monitored by GC, the reaction mixtures being analysed at appropriate intervals in order to measure the hydrogen uptake. Hydrogen diffusion control in the reactions was examined. The effect of external diffusion was checked by lowering the shaking rate from 300 to 100 strokes/min. The reaction rates were found to be independent of the shaking rate above 200 strokes min-'. Internal diffusion was excluded by using catalysts with a grain diameter less than 0.149 mm. The hydrogen uptake, r, was found to vary linearly with the weight of catalyst, w. The plot of 1 / r versus I / w was also linear, and allowed the hydrogen transfer rate to be obtained from the reciprocal of the intercept [ 33 ] . Such a rate exceeded that of hydrogen uptake in all cases. On the other hand, we also checked for the absence of diffusion control by applying the Koros-Novak criterion [ 27 ] . 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Reduction of alkenes Many synthetic procedures include some step that involves reduction of one double bond in a substrate containing several of them, so the selectivity of the process in question is of great potential interest for industrial purposes. Selectivity studies in this context involve investigating the influence of such factors as the solvent nature, type of substituents and catalytic support used, among others. The M. A.

Aramendia et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994)131-147 theory of competitive hydrogenations allows one to assess the effects of such factors on model substrates. Tables 3 and 4 list the results obtained in the reduction of variously substituted carbon-carbon double bonds (R,RZC=CR3G), where R,, RZ and R3 denote radicals or hydrogen and G is the functional group present in the substrate. The kinetics of reduction of carbon-carbon double bonds with Pd/sepiolite catalysts, the occurrence of a compensating effect at an isokinetic temperature in the reduction with gas hydrogen ( O=179 C), and the existence of a linear freeenergy relationship between the rate of reduction of the alkene double bond and several characteristic parameters of the olefinic bond have been reported elsewhere [28-30]. All the substrates assayed were studied for the influence of their substituents on the rate of reduction of the double bond (rg) in an attempt at correlating such a rate with various characteristic parameters for the substituents by applying the multiple regression method to the following equation: logrg =AO + p;(Eo-;) +O(EorR) + 8(EES) +h(dn) where AO is an independent term; Eo-;, Eo-R and EE, are the summations of the parameters for the substrate substituents in relation to inductive, resonance and steric effects; and do is a term accounting for the hyperconjugation effect. Inductive effects exhibited poor correlations, so they were excluded from the multiple regression. The final correlations obtained for the rate of reduction of the double bond with molecular hydrogen (rH) and by hydrogen transfer( rT) were as follows (the figures in square brackets denote partial significances) logrT = -1.37+0.21R(FO'R) +0.63(EES) -0.08(dn) [1] [59] [40] logrH =1.69 + 1.64R(F-O'R) -0.02(EES) -0.09(dn) [1] [59] [40] A comparison of the results obtained in the hydrogen-transfer reductions with those found in the reactions with molecular hydrogen revealed steric effects to be prevalent in the former and resonance and hyperconjugation effects to be predominant in the latter, consistent with the above equations. In order to determine the effect of introducing an additional methyl group on the carbon-carbon double bond we selected four substrate pairs, viz., acrylamide/ methacrylamide, acrolein/methacrolein, styrene/ a-methylstyrene and methyl acrylate/methyl methacrylate, which were applied to the competitive hydrogenation equations after the pertinent experiments were performed. According to the theory of competitive reactions on solid catalysts [ 311, the simultaneous reaction of two reducible molecules, A and B, is a competitive process when the plot of log (Cp / CA) vs. log (CB /CB) is linear (C is the initial concentration and C that at time t), so the simultaneous hydrogenation of A and B was indeed a competitive process.

We also calculated the relative equilibrium adsorption constant (DA,B)from the expression RA,B = LA r DA,B (1) s where rA and rB are the individual reaction rates of A and B, respectively. This equation only holds provided the concentrations of A and B are high enough for rA and rB to be independent of the concentrations, as shown above. Table 5 lists the results obtained for the four studied pairs in the competitive reductions with molecular hydrogen. As can be seen, all four pairs yielded high SSo values (i.e. selectivities corresponding to a hydrogen uptake equal to 50% of the theoretical total consumption, which signals the point at which one of the compounds would be completely reduced if the process were 100% selective). We studied the variation of the selectivity as a function of the catalyst and solvent used for the acrylamide/methacrylamide pair. The results obtained are shown in Table 6. As can be seen for catalyst Pd3SEP400, the relative reactivity was independent of the reaction temperature used. Therefore, application of the equation derived by Marinas et al. [ 26 ] , Rd (lnRA,CMAC) _ - (EaAC ,+ WAC) + (EBMAC + WMAC) - (true) AC,MAC d(1/T) (2) where Ea is the apparent activation energy, W the heat of adsorption and Et ,, the real activation energy, reveals that the real activation energies of the two compounds are identical, i.e., (dEtne)AC,MC-0. Because the apparent activation energies are identical (EaAC = 29.8 t 1.4 1 kJ / mol } and E~,MA, = 29.6 t 0. 8 { kJ / mol } between 293 and 318 K), the heats of adsorption must be identical too. M. A. Aramendfa et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994)131-147 141 Since the rates of reduction of acrylamide and methacrylamide are different (Table 4), there must be some difference in their activation entropies (AS) as given by the following expression: a k =kTlh ex pV n+R ~xP(RT) (3) Inasmuch as the entropy factor can be ascribed to the steric hindrance to adsorption, the decreased rate of reduction of methacrylamide must be the result of the steric effect of the methyl group on the process. We also studied the variation of the selectivity as a function of the catalyst and solvent used for the acrylamide/methacrylamide pair. The results obtained are shown in Table 6. It should be emphasized that catalyst Pd3SEP4(* was more selective than catalyst Pd3PM2 and the commercially available, carbon-supported Pd catalysts from Merck and Fluka. Of the solvents used, methanol provided the highest reaction rates and lowest selectivity and relative reactivity in the competitive hydrogenations. The best selectivity was obtained with THF as solvent. In previous work [ 30,51 ] we showed the factors governing the acid-base behaviour of solvents (Taft's a and ss), as well as those related to the dielectric constant, to account for the rate and selectivity differences observed between various solvents. As regards the hydrogen-transfer reduction, inasmuch as the donor (cyclohexene) and the substrates to be reduced are adsorbed on the same sites, it was impossible to apply the theory of competitive hydrogenations. 3.2. Reduction of phenylacetylene The earliest semi-hydrogenation of acetylenic triple bonds was reported by Sabatier and Senderens [ 32a] ; also, catalytic selectivity was first studied by Paal [ 32b ] in 1909. Selectivity and stereoselectivity have both been the subject of several reviews [ 34-37 ] . The acetylene content in butadiene to be polymerized industrially must be lower than 100 ppm if catalyst poisoning is to be avoided. Selective removal of acetylene traces in the presence of double bonds is thus mandatory in industrial polymerization processes [35,36]. Pd/A1203 catalysts are highly selective and stereoselective in gas-phase reactions [ 37,38 ] . Thus, Lindlar's catalyst has been used in such reactions with varying results depending on the polarity of the solvent employed. Isler's catalyst is also widely used in this type of process [ 39,40] . In previous work [41,42], we studied the optimal conditions for the selective reduction of phenylacetylene with catalyst Pd3SEP400 on the basis of the theory of competitive hydrogenations [ 31 ] and that of Sporka [ 43 ] , as well as the applicability of both to the selective semi-hydrogenation of other alkynes and, wherever possible, the stereoselectivity of the process. 142 M.

Table 7 lists the results obtained in the semi-hydrogenation of the triple bond of phenylacetylene. As can be seen, catalyst Pd3SEP400 provided a similar selectivity to those obtained with the commercially available catalysts from Degussa and Fluka. Like acrylamide, phenylacetylene cannot be reduced by hydrogen transfer using cyclohexene as donor. We should note that, under these conditions, both styrene and methacrylamide were readily reduced. Application of the theory of competitive hydrogenations revealed that too high acceptor/donor adsorption coefficient ratios (see Table 8), which result in the hydrogen acceptor (acrylamide or phenylacetylene) being so strongly adsorbed as to inhibit the donor adsorption, were responsible for this experimental fact. On the other hand, hydrogenation with molecular hydrogen was possible for acrylamide and phenylacetylene because the hydrogen was adsorbed at sites other than those for the substrate to be reduced. 3.3. Reduction of acetophenone Depending on the reduction conditions and medium acidity used [O], the reduction of acetophenone with heterogeneous catalysts can yield the corresponding Table 8 Relative reactivities and relative adsorption coefficients for the reduction of four substrate pairs with molecular hydrogen obtained by using catalyst Pd3SEPboo A/B pair kA/k,3 RA,B DA,$ Acrylamide/Cyclohexene 3.92 117.6 30.0 Methacrylamide/Cyclohexene 0.96 2.2 2.3 Phenylacetylene/Cyclohexene 1.83 269.1 147.1 Styrene/ Cyclohexene 4.02 11.0 9.8 M.

Which product is obtained predominantly depends on the additives present in the reaction medium. Thus, acetophenone hydrogenolysis can be avoided by using base traces. Although the alcohol usually occurs as an intermediate in the formation of the alkyl aromatic hydrocarbon, Rylander [45] believes that the hydrogenolysis of the oxygen function may not involve the corresponding carbinol. Notwithstanding the wealth of literature available on the reduction of alkyl aromatic ketones with hydrogen, their reduction by hydrogen transfer remains a scarcely studied subject. Some authors have obtained low yields [46] ; others, such as Brieger and Fu [ 47 ] and Brieger et al. [ 48 ] , have achieved excellent conversions by using acid promoters and claim that hydrogen-transfer reductions are major alternatives to Clemmensen reductions in this respect. However, they call for large catalyst excesses and rather long reaction times. In earlier papers [49,50] dealing with acetophenone reduction by hydrogen transfer with cyclohexene as donor we discussed the influence of the palladium salts used as precursors in the catalyst preparation procedure on the ratio of 1phenylethanol to (1-phenylethanol + ethylbenzene) . For analogous overall conversions, PdCIZ was the precursor yielding the highest proportions of ethylbenzene; this precursor resulted in an increased number of acid sites in the catalyst relative to the original support, while the other two precursors had the opposite effect. The selectivity towards the alcohol in the case of precursor Na2PdC14 was found to be influenced by the addition of different amounts of NaOH. The higher the proportion of NaOH added was, the higher was the selectivity towards the alcohol. Since this in turn resulted in decreased support acidity as determined with both cyclohexylamine and pyridine, acid sites seemed to be clearly involved in the hydrogenolysis of 1-phenylethanol to ethylbenzene [50]. This is clearly consistent with the results given in Tables 9 and 10 for the hydrogen transfer reduction, and in Table 11 for that with molecular hydrogen. Table 9 lists the results obtained by adding a Lewis acid (FeC13) and a Bronsted acid (HCl) to the reaction medium in the hydrogen-transfer process. Both acids clearly favour the formation of ethylbenzene. 144 M. A.

In previous work we studied the variation of the cyclohexane/benzene (CHA/ BZ) ratio during the disproportionation/dehydrogenation of cyclohexene (CHE). Such a ratio should be 2 for a pure disproportionation and 0 for a pure dehydrogenation process: 3CHE -),BZ + 2CHA (disproportionation ) CHE -4 BZ + 2H2 (dehydrogenation) The ratio was found to be ca. 0.6 at 150 C and decrease with increasing temperature (i.e. the amount of hydrogen in the reaction medium rose with increase in the temperature). Inasmuch as the catalyst contained excess hydrogen in the presence of cyclohexene, such an excess, which increased with increasing temperature, must be the source of the hydride ions involved in the hydrogenolysis process. Table 11 lists the results obtained in the reduction of acetophenone with molecular hydrogen and the catalysts giving rise to the smallest extents of hydrogenolysis in the hydrogen-transfer reductions. Similarly, Bronsted and Lewis acids clearly influenced the formation of ethylbenzene. As can be seen, between 87% and 96% selectivity towards 1-phenylethanol from acetophenone was readily achieved with the sepiolite catalysts. It is worth noting that the use of acetic acid as solvent in the reduction of acetophenone with molecular hydrogen results in a selectivity of 98% for 100% conversion to the alcohol, which is finally esterified to its acetate. Thus, by optimizing the reaction conditions, one can obtain complementary results in reductions by hydrogen transfer and with molecular hydrogen. Our experimental results allow us to conclude that the higher the surface acidity (either of Bronsted or of Lewis type) is, the more favourable will be the second M. A.

From a practical point of view, if the interest lies in the formation of the alcohol, one can significantly decrease the rate of the second step by \"neutralizing\" the acid catalyst with a base, or by converting the alcohol to an ester (e.g., with acetic acid). In summary, Spanish sepiolites are attractive supports for palladium catalysts that can be used in reduction processes. Because of the high added value of such catalysts and the abundance of sepiolites in Spain, we believe it of a high economic interest to foster development of these catalysts.

        "dc:description": "This paper reviews the use of Spanish sepiolites as supports for Pd catalysts employed for the reduction of variously substituted alkenes, the selective semi-hydrogenation of phenylacetylene and the reduction of acetophenone, both with gaseous hydrogen and by hydrogen transfer with cyclohexene as donor. The performance of Pd/sepiolite catalysts is compared with that of synthesized catalysts supported over SiO2, SiO2AlPO4, AlPO4 and AlPO4Al2O3, which we have used extensively, as well as with that of several commercially available catalysts from Fluka, Merck and Degussa.",
