Graphical abstract Lipase from Mucor miehei was immobilized on chitosan hydrogels without using any activation agent. These low-cost and easy to prepare lipase-containing hydrogels could be considered as novel solid-phase biocatalysts for use in organic media. When they were applied as biocatalysts towards the model esterification reaction of propyl laurate synthesis they showed an optimum operation temperature at 30°C and maintained a high catalytic activity in various non-polar organic solvents. The higher initial esterification rates were obtained when biocatalysis took place in branched hydrocarbons where the initial rates recorded were twice the ones observed for straight hydrocarbons, being 0.22mM/min in isooctane and 0.11mM/min in hexane, respectively. The novel catalyst presented excellent reusability, with only 10% loss of activity after 12 uses, which is even higher than the one obtained by lipase-containing chitosan beads prepared with a cross-linker. Moreover, enzyme superactivity was evident for several runs. Keywords Biocatalysis Enzyme Esterification Natural polymers Gels 1 Introduction The use of immobilized enzymes appears to be a green, sustainable procedure that has much to offer: mild reaction conditions, usually no by-products, high regio-, chemo- and stereo- selectivity, shorter synthetic routes, less waste and generally environmentally and economically improved high quality results. Enzyme immobilization onto solid supports leads to increased thermal and operational stability and recoverability. These issues have been so far pointed out by several authors [1–4]. Among the enzymes studied, lipases are of particular interest as they find a broad range of industrial applications due to the variety of the reactions they catalyse. They are used in multiple industrial applications in food and flavour making, pharmaceuticals, detergents, cosmetics and perfumery [5], usually by catalysing synthetic instead of hydrolytic reactions. The type of support as well as the method of immobilization influences the activity and operational stability of immobilized lipases. Various supports have been used so far for lipase immobilization, including inorganic materials (e.g. silica, celite, ceramics, zeolites) [6], synthetic polymers (e.g. amberlite, polyvinyl chloride, polyurethane) [7] or natural polymers (e.g. pectin, starch, cellulose, gelatin, agar, carrageenan, chitin, chitosan) [8]. Among these, chitosan is a polysaccharide obtained easily by alkaline hydrolysis of chitin, a widely abundant natural polymer that can be derived from the exoskeletons of crustaceans, the cuticles of insects and the cell walls of most fungi. Chitosan is biocompatible, non-toxic, able to absorb liquids and able to form films and beads. Therefore, it has been extensively studied in many fields for various applications. These include pharmaceutics as drug carrier, wound dressing material and tissue engineering [9,10], manufacturing materials such as optical and electronic devices [11] or batteries [12], as well as the field of heterogeneous organocatalysis [13]. However, only limited studies refer to chitosan as a matrix for enzyme immobilization [14–16]. Furthermore, these chitosan-based biocatalysts are used in aqueous environment for the catalysis of hydrolytic reactions and not for the synthesis of esters. Protocols for enzyme immobilization on chitosan matrices often demand an initial surface modification or activation step. In most cases, carbodiimide is used as a coupling agent to activate the hydroxyl groups of chitosan [14,15] and glutaraldehyde to cross-link the lipase to the amino groups [14]. In other cases, sodium tripolyphosphate solution [17] or epichlorohydrin [16] is used followed by amino acid coupling. In this work, a simpler method is used for lipase immobilization on chitosan hydrogel that does not involve any activation agent. Aqueous solution of the enzyme is mixed with chitosan solution to produce an enzyme-containing hydrogel. The produced biocatalyst is then used in organic solvent, to catalyze the model esterification reaction of propyl laurate synthesis. Since the appropriate choice of the immobilization process influences the operational costs of industrial processes, the suitability of the proposed biocatalyst is tested towards various parameters, such as temperature, storage stability and reusability. The aim of this work is to suggest an immobilization process that truly meets the requirements of sustainable chemistry in terms of cost and energy consumption reduction, giving good results as regards recovery and reuse of the catalyst, a parameter that is mandatory for the process to be economically viable at industrial scale. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Mucor miehei (M. miehei) lipase was supplied by Fluka, Basel, Switzerland and had a specific activity of 1.19U/mg of protein (1U corresponds to the amount of enzyme which liberates 1μmol butyric acid per min at pH 8.0 and 40°C using tributyrine as substrate). Peroxidase from horseradish (HRP, Type XII) with a specific activity of 382 units/mg solid (using pyrogallol) and 2,2΄-Azino-bis(3-ehtylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany. Chitosan (viscosity 200–600 mPa.s, 0.5% in 0.5% Acetic acid, 20°C; Deacetylation value: 80%) was purchased from TCI, Belgium. Hydrogen peroxide 30% was purchased from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany. All other materials were at least reagent grade. Millipore Milli-Q water was used for the preparation of gels and buffer solution. 2.2 Preparation of hydrogels Chitosan hydrogels were prepared by adding acidic water (pH=3) at 30°C to the appropriate amount of chitosan. The mixture was stirred until the whole amount of water was absorbed by chitosan. Then the appropriate amount of Tris/HCl buffer, pH=7.5 containing lipase was added. In a typical experiment, 0.25g of chitosan is mixed with 0.25mL of water, followed by the addition of 15μL of buffer solution containing 0.15mg of lipase and stirred at room temperature. Each hydrogel was washed three times with 5mL of isooctane to remove any enzyme molecules that may not be effectively encapsulated to the gel network. 2.3 Lipase-catalyzed reactions The esterification reactions took place under batch conditions. 0.5g of hydrogel (containing 0.15mg of lipase) was placed in a flask with 5mL of the appropriate organic solvent containing lauric acid and 1-propanol (100mM/1:1). The flasks were preserved at room temperature without stirring. At fixed time intervals samples of 10μL each were withdrawn before less than 10% of the substrate was consumed and analysed by GC. Each reaction was measured in duplicate and conversions were calculated by using calibration curves of butyl laurate ester in the presence of dodecane as an external standard. For the gas chromatography (GC) analysis a HP5 column (30m x 0.25mm i.d. x 0.32 μm film thickness) mounted on a Hewlett-Packard (HP) Model GC-6890C was used. Injector as well as detector temperature was 270°C and oven temperature was held constant at 200°C. 2.4 Horseradish peroxidase reaction For the oxidation reaction, 0.2g of hydrogel containing 0.17μg of Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was placed in a cuvette with 1mL acetate buffer (0.05M, pH 4.5) containing 0.6mM ABTS and 1.2mM H2O2. The reaction was followed spectrophotometrically by measuring the one-electron oxidation of ABTS into the corresponding radical-cation ABTS + at 414nm. UV–vis spectra were recorded with a Cary 1E Varian spectrophotometer. 3 Results and discusion 3.1 Optimization of chitosan-based hydrogels In the present work, the ability of a natural polymer, i.e. chitosan, to form hydrogels containing lipase as well as the catalytic effectiveness of these lipase-containing hydrogels towards the synthesis of fatty acid esters, were investigated. In order to obtain chitosan-based gels, several methods have been proposed to induce chemical or physical cross-linking [10]. In this study, a different approach was tested where no activation agent was used. A simpler method was chosen according to which chitosan was mixed with water followed by addition of aqueous enzyme solution. The conditions under which this chitosan-water mixture should take place had to be determined. Chitosan is not a common polymer in nature. It is manufactured by the parent, natural molecule chitin by alkaline de-acetylation. The product of the de-acetylation, i.e. chitosan, is a linear polysaccharide of β-(1-4) linked 2-acetamide-2-deoxy-d-glucose (the neutral A-unit) and 2-amino-2-deoxy-d-glucose (the positively charged D-unit). The chain length of the polymer as well as the fraction of A-units (FA ) vary with FA -value raging from ca. 0.7 (70% acetylated) to 0 (0% acetylated). In this study, the chitosan used had an FA value of 0.2, being 80% de-acetylated, therefore since it is enriched in D-units it acts as a polyelectrolyte. Since the isoelectric point of chitosan is close to 6.3, the amine groups of D-units are positively charged at pH-values below 6.3, influencing its solubility in acidic medium and allowing thus, ionic induced cross-linking. This was experimentally confirmed by forming chitosan hydrogels using water with various pH-values. It was found that gels prepared with acidic water at pH-value 3 were rigid and maintained their integrity in various solvents, while gels prepared with water at higher pH values could not retain their structure when an external solvent was added. Following this procedure of mixing chitosan with acidic water, it was found that chitosan forms gels with a mass fraction of polymer in gels from 0.13 to 0.50. Hydrogels formed at these concentration ranges of polymer were stable in contact with non-polar as well as polar organic solvents at 25°C and maintained their structural integrity for several days. The prepared hydrogel was then used as a matrix for enzyme immobilization. Two enzymes, namely Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and M. miehei lipase, were encapsulated in chitosan hydrogels and were both able to maintain their catalytic activity towards model reactions. More specifically, HRP was tested towards the oxidation of ABTS by H2O2 while M. miehei was tested towards the esterification of 1-propanol with lauric acid. Fig. 1 shows a typical reaction profile for both procedures. The specific activity of the immobilized lipase was 27μM/min/mg of enzyme for propyl laurate synthesis. The reaction yield was 60% after 24h of reaction. Similar results were obtained for the synthesis of α-monolaurin by lauric acid and glycidol using C. rugosa lipase immobilized on porous chitosan-silica hybrid microspheres [18] where a conversion of 82% was achieved after 50h of reaction. Similarely, the synthesis of butyl butyrate catalyzed by C. rugosa lipase showed an activity of 27.9μmol/min when immobilized on chitosan flakes [19]. A wide variety of enzyme classes have been reported to keep their catalytic activity when immobilized on chitosan matrix, including oxidases, dehydrogenases, amylases, phosphatases and lipases [20]. However, the use of lipase-loaded chitosan has been strictly limited to the catalysis of hydrolytic reactions, with some exceptions by the groups of Brunel [18,21] and Castro [19,22]. Therefore, this work focuses on the use of a novel chitosan-lipase matrix for the catalysis of a synthetic reaction in organic solvents. The effect of polymer concentration in terms of mass fraction, ξC, on the esterification rate of propyl laurate synthesis is studied and presented in Fig. 2 . As can be seen, an increase in the mass fraction of the polymer, and thus a decrease of the water content of the gel, results in an increased initial reaction rate. The same behaviour has been observed for M. miehei lipase immobilised in HPMC and agar organogels catalysing hexyl laurate synthesis [23], lipase-catalysed esterifications in supercritical CO2 [24], the esterification of propyl laurate synthesis catalysed by P. cepacia lipase immobilised in agar microemulsion-based organogels (MBGs) [25] as well as C. antarctica and R. miehei in HPMC and agar MBGs [26]. The opposite behaviour, though, was reported for gelatin gels [4]. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the states of water in HPMC-based organogels [24] as well as chitosan-based hydrogels [27]. It was found that the state of water in the polymer hydrogel was divided into three categories, namely, free (freezing), weakly bound (freezing) and strongly bound (non-freezing) water. Free water, exhibiting similar transition temperature, enthalpy and DSC curves as pure water, was determined as the water which does not take part in hydrogen bonding with polymer molecules. It was also observed that in hydrogels with increased water content the amount of free water was higher [24,27]. Taking this study into account, the decreased reaction rate observed for gels with higher water content could be attributed to the existence of more free water molecules which can shift the reaction equilibrium towards the hydrolysis, limiting thus the esterification. Therefore, as more appropriate catalyst for esterification reactions, a hydrogel with higher polymer mass fraction was chosen (point A in Fig. 2). The specific activity for the chosen catalyst was 1.3mM/min/mg of immobilized enzyme. Since temperature is a parameter that affects both, solubility and ionization, it is expected that temperature of the acidic water will affect the catalyst formation. The performance of the biocatalyst prepared with water at different temperatures was studied and it was found that water temperature during the immobilization did not influence the rate of the esterification reaction that took place at room temperature (data not shown), therefore it can be concluded that the formation of the enzyme-containing hydrogel is not influenced by the temperature under which it takes place. 3.2 Diffusion of substrates and products As the biocatalytic procedure involving gels is heterogeneous, it is important to study the diffusion of the substrates and products in the biocatalyst, as it might limit the esterification rate. Therefore, the diffusion of 1-dodecanol and butyl laurate in the absence of enzyme was evaluated using isooctane as an external solvent. Fig. 3 shows that the concentration of the alcohol (in the absence of acid) in the external solvent, as indicated by the dashed line, fluctuates until equilibrium is established between alcohol in the gel and alcohol in the solvent. Equilibrium was reached for every initial concentration studied (data not shown). The concentration of the product, butyl laurate, seems to follow the same pattern, until equilibrium is reached leaving in the exterior solvent about 90% of its initial amount. It can be concluded that the structure of the hydrogel permits the diffusion of the substrates and the products, since they both −after equilibrium is settled- remain in a high ratio outside the gel. The diffusion study is fundamental for all the conversion reactions in biphasic systems that involve diffusion of substrates or products at least in one stage of the procedure. Generally, during the biocatalytic synthesis we can assume that the alcohol concentration in the interior of the gel remains constant. This is not the case of a very fast reaction where a possible slow diffusion impeaches setting the equilibrium concentration so quickly. The concentration of the substrates into the gel in such a case tends to zero since as soon as they reach the enzyme they are instantly converted. The kinetic procedure is therefore diffusion limited. In our case, however, equilibrium can be reached within 20min, while as can be seen from Fig. 1, the reaction takes several hours to complete. The synthesis takes place with a lower rate, allowing enough time for the equilibrium concentration to settle. The synthesis is thus limited by the reaction rate and the diffusion does not seem to be the rate-limiting step of the procedure. The structure of the hydrogel does not provide a barrier for the substrates to enter the catalyst, nor keep the product inside; hence, they can be considered as appropriate media for esterification reactions of aliphatic alcohols with fatty acids. The same conclusion was reached when the lipase was immobilized on HPMC or agar MBGs based on lecithin [28]. However, the procedure shifted from rate-limited to diffusion-limited when lecithin was replaced by AOT, for both HPMC and agar MBGs [28]. 3.3 Effect of the concentration of lipase on the reaction rate The effect of the lipase concentration in chitosan hydrogels on the reaction rate was tested. Fig. 4 shows the effect of varying the concentration of M. miehei lipase, calculated in terms of mg of lipase per g of gel, on the esterification rate of 1-propanol (100mM) with lauric acid (100mM) in isooctane. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the esterification rate initially increases until a peak is observed at 0.3mg of lipase per g of gel, followed by a decrease for higher enzyme concentration. The fact that the increasing part of the pattern shown in Fig. 4 −observed for the lower enzyme concentrations- lacks linearity, can be attributed to mass transfer limitations as linearity depends on the rate-limiting step of the procedure. The same result was observed for P. cepacia lipase immobilised in agar, gelatin or κ-carrageenan organogels based on lecithin microemulsions, where the esterification rate of propyl laurate synthesis increased as the amount of lipase in the organogels increased, giving however, a non-linear profile [29]. Linearity is associated with a kinetically controlled enzymatic reaction and it has been observed for M. miehei lipase immobilised in HPMC and agar organogels [23] as well as for Chromobacterium viscosum lipase immobilised in gelatin organogels [30]. These studies reported that when the amount of lipase in the MBGs increased, the esterification rate increased linearly. From Fig. 4 it can also be observed that for enzyme amount higher than 0.3mg/g of gel the reaction rate decreases. This could be attributed to strereochemically induced hindering of the substrate diffusion due to increased enzyme concentration, as well as binding of the enzyme molecules with the gel matrix with different binding sites that may induce changes to enzyme conformation or hindering of the catalytic centre accessibility, affecting thus, enzyme’s interaction with the substrates. 3.4 Effect of incubation temperature The activity of M. miehei lipase immobilized on chitosan hydrogel towards the esterification reaction of lauric acid with 1-propanol was monitored as a function of incubation temperature. The reaction was initiated by addition of the lipase-containing hydrogel in the reaction solution which was pre-equilibrated to the desired temperature. The temperature dependence of the catalytic activity of the immobilized lipase is shown on Table 1 . As can be seen, increase of the temperature initially increases the reaction rate. However, for temperatures higher than 30°C the reaction rate decreases. The increase observed for the first part of the curve is expected, as increased temperature offers energy to the system, allowing thus higher reaction rate. The decrease observed above 30°C could be attributed to enzyme denaturation. A similar temperature profile was reported for C. rugosa lipase immobilized on chitosan beads towards the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl palmitate [14], as well as for R. miehei lipase in aqueous solution and AOT microemulsions for temperature above 40°C [31] and was attributed to reversible denaturation of the enzyme. Moreover, the same results have been observed for R. miehei lipase immobilized on HPMC as well as agar organogels based on AOT microemulsions for temperatures higher than 50°C and 40°C, respectively [28]. Again in this case, the loss of activity was attributed to enzyme deactivation and not to destruction of organogel matrix induced by temperature. 3.5 Effect of reaction medium In order to study the influence of the solvent on the enzymatic activity towards the esterification of lauric acid with 1-propanol, several solvents were tested. These were either branched or non-branched, including alcohols, hydrocarbons and esters. Fig. 5 presents the initial rate of the reaction for the different reaction solvents. As can be seen from Fig. 5, when the biocatalyst was used in non-polar solvents the enzyme maintained its catalytic activity. The strait chained hydrocarbons tested gave high initial rates, with the higher rate given for the reaction in hexane, namely 0.11mM/min. However, what should be noticed here is that branched hydrocarbons presented much higher reaction rates, with the reaction rate for isooctane being 0.22mM/min −twice the rate presented in hexane- followed by isopentane (0.18mM/min). Branched and cyclic hydrocarbons, especially isooctane and cyclohexane, have been reported to give higher apparent enzyme activities by many authors that have studied enzymes immobilized on organogels [4,32,33]. The higher activities observed for these solvents in comparison to the non-branched ones could be explained by the structure of their molecules that keeps them from packing tightly, allowing thus, higher participation of the substrates molecules within the enzyme close vicinity. Among the non-branched hydrocarbons, the higher enzymatic activity was observed in the case of hexane, with the activity gradually decreasing as the length of the alkane solvent increased. This is in accordance with the findings of other authors that studied lipases immobilized in organogels [25,29,30]. Since industrial processes incline towards neat reaction mixtures, solvent-free reactions were tested, where the alcoholic substrate plays the role of the solvent. However, as can be seen from Fig. 5, when the biocatalyst was used in very polar environment, i.e. in alcohols or acetone, the reaction yielded traces of the product or no product at all. Polar solvents can directly participate in non-covalent solvent-protein interactions and replace or remove water molecules. Water molecules bound to the enzyme are responsible for maintaining its active conformation. When they are stripped from the biomolecule by the solvent, inactivation occurs. In any case, even relatively polar solvents, such as hexanol or octanol, appeared to be less effective than non-polar solvents. It should be mentioned here that chitosan hydrogel appeared to maintain its structure even in the most polar solvents used, which is not the case for organogels. It has been reported that HPMC [23], agar [23] and gelatin [32] organogels were destroyed in polar solvents, as significant amounts of gel components were detected in the external solvent phase. Combining the above described results, it seems that the optimum conditions for the performance of the catalyst in organic environment towards propyl laurate synthesis is using 0.3mg of lipase per g of gel, a polymer mass fraction of 0.48, the temperature at 30°C and isooctane as a solvent. Under these conditions, the higher enzyme activity was achieved giving a reaction rate of 0.30mM/min corresponding to a specific activity of 2mM/min per mg of immobilized lipase. This constitutes a 3-fold increase in comparison to the starting catalyst performance. The new chitosan-lipase matrix is thus a better biocatalyst as compared to the results reported in the literature. Namely, for the reported synthesis of butyl butyrate catalyzed by C. rugosa lipase immobilized on chitosan flakes the activity was 27.9μmol/min [19]. For the synthesis of α-monolaurin by lauric acid and glycidol catalyzed by C. rugosa lipase immobilized on porous chitosan-silica hybrid microspheres [18] the conversion was 82% but after 50h of reaction. 3.6 Operational and storage stability of lipase in hydrogel For any application of immobilized enzymes on industrial uses, the feasibility of regeneration of the enzyme activity and consequent reuse of the biocatalyst is important for the economic viability of a biosynthetic process [34]. Therefore, the reusability of M. miehei lipase immobilized on chitosan hydrogels was studied. For this purpose, a chitosan hydrogel containing lipase was prepared and used for the catalysis of propyl laurate synthesis in isooctane. After 2h of reaction, the catalyst was removed from the reaction solution, washed using isooctane (3 times x 5mL) and re-used with a fresh substrate solution. The activity of the lipase was well preserved and the results are presented in Fig. 6 . As can be seen, no significant loss of activity could be observed for the catalyst for 12 successive uses, with its relative activity on the 12th use being 90% to the initial one. These results are better that the ones observed for C. rugosa lipase immobilized on amino acid modified chitosan beads where 37% loss of activity was evident after only 5 hydrolysis runs [16], C. rugosa lipase immobilized on wet chitosan beads by activation of the hydroxyl groups where 15% loss was observed after 10 reuses [15] and C. rugosa lipase immobilized on chitosan beads by binary immobilization where the lipase retained 74% of residual activity after 10 uses [14]. The loss of activity in these studies was attributed to the leakage of protein from the chitosan beads to the external water. To the same phenomenon was also attributed the loss of activity in repeated use of lipase-containing organogels [35]. In our case, the loss of activity of 62% that can be seen on the 13th use could be possibly attributed to enzyme denaturation caused by the extensive contact with the external organic solvent. From Fig. 6 it can also be seen a significantly increased activity (superactivity) of the lipase for the uses 2–7, with the highest activity occurring on the 5th use being 30% higher in respect to the initial one. A slight superactivity could also be observed in the case of C. antarctica lipase immobilized on HPMC organogels based on surfactant-free microemulsions [36]. The superactivity phenomenon is not common for lipases immobilized on gels, as the water that is a co-product of the esterification reaction can induce lower reaction rates [4]. However, superactivity has been observed in several cases of oxidative enzymes encapsulated in microemulsions and is attributed to conformational changes of the enzymes after encapsulation, the effect of the surfactants head group, or the effect of the state of micellar water [37]. In the present work, the superactivity observed for M. miehei lipase occurs after its first use. Therefore, it could not be attributed to conformational changes of the enzyme after immobilization since they would affect the first use as well. A plausible explanation of this superactivity could be the effect of accumulation of reaction products that may alter the conformation of the bound enzyme. Alternatively, superactivity could be due to impurities of chitosan that could not be rinsed from the gel by washing it with the solvent, but are able to be washed away in the reaction solution during the first use of the biocatalyst. Apart from the operational stability, the storage (non-operational) stability of an immobilized lipase is an equally important parameter based on which the practical application of a biocatalyst can be determined [34]. In order to study the storage stability of the immobilized lipase, several enzyme-containing chitosan hydrogels were prepared and stored under freezing, at −20°C. At fixed time intervals, a biocatalyst was withdrawn, defrosted and used for propyl laurate synthesis, at 25°C. Fig. 7 shows the effect of storage time on the enzymatic activity of immobilized lipase. As can be seen, the lipase activity is higher when a freshly prepared hydrogel is used. The residual activity decreases to 62% in respect to the initial one after one day of storage period, and to 42% after 4days. However, after that initial decrease the enzymatic activity remains almost constant for over a month, under freeze. Similar results were reported before [36], when the same lipase was immobilized in HPMC organogels formulated with AOT or surfactant free microemulsions. The residual enzymatic activity was reported to decrease to 50% and 10%, respectively, over the studied storage period. Moreover, the same behaviour was observed for this lipase in other low water media [31,38], as well as in various surfactant free microemulsions [36,39]. The lower stability that M. miehei lipase exhibited in these works in comparison to other studied lipases was attributed to unfavourable interactions of the enzyme molecules with the environment. 4 Conclusions Lipase was immobilized on chitosan hydrogels by a simple method that involved no activation agent. The produced biocatalyst can be used in organic, non-polar environment to catalyse esterification reactions. The novel catalyst permits easy diffusion of the substrates and products. Optimum reaction temperature of the immobilized lipase was similar as the one reported for free enzyme. Enzyme-containing hydrogel retained its integrity in a wide range of solvents, polar and non-polar, alcohols, hydrocarbons and esters, however, high reaction rates were observed when non-polar solvents were involved. The highest reaction rates were observed for branched hydrocarbons, namely isooctane and isopentane. A most appealing feature of the novel biocatalyst is the ability to maintain high activity after 12 batch esterifications, which is also strengthened by superactivity after the first use and for 6 consequent uses. Overall, the results of this study indicate a novel, cheap and easy to prepare, promising biocatalyst. Future work will focus on the immobilization of other enzyme classes and the investigation of reactions aiming to potential industrial applications.
