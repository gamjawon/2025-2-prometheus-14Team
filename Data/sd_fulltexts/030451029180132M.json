Corma* and C. del Pino Inst. de Tecnologia Quimica, Camino Vera s/n, 46071 Valencia (Spain) (Received July 2, 1991; accepted July 26, 1991) Abstract New rhodium complexes of formula [RhCI(COD)L], [RhCI(CO)zL], [Rh(PPh3)ZL] and the corresponding cationic ones, where L=2-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)aminocarbonylpyrrolidine, have been covalently bound to silica and ultrastable Y-zeolite containing supermicropores. The complexes anchored on the zeolite show a higher activity for alkene hydrogenation than the free complexes in homogeneous medium, the silicaanchored catalysts being the least active. No loss in hydrogenation activity was observed with the complexes immobilized on zeolite after ten recycles, and the leaching of metal was not appreciable; thus they represent a truly heterogeneous counterpart to homogeneous transition metal complex catalysts. Introduction Heterogenized homogeneous catalysts have been intensively investigated and their advantages and disadvantages with respect to the corresponding homogeneous ones have been the subject of numerous publications [ 1 ]. Although organic supports have been used frequently, the advantages of inorganic ones with respect to stability have been pointed out in the literature [1, 2]. Nevertheless, it is generally reported that when anchoring organometallic complexes on both organic [3] and inorganic [4] supports, their intrinsic catalytic activity is reduced. Since the rate of a given reaction depends on both the intrinsic rate constant and reactant concentration, it becomes apparent that the decrease in the intrinsic activity of homogeneous catalysts when anchored could be compensated by increasing the concentration of reactants in their proximity due to a surface concentration effect. This effect could be achieved through an appropriate choice of support, which *Authors to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/91/$3.50 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 370 can act positively by absorbing the reactant molecules and increasing their concentration in the proximity of the organometallic active sites. The USY zeolite prepared by a combination of steam and chemical treatments combines a large number of silanol groups for anchoring positions with the presence of supermicropores formed during the controlled collapse of some sodalite units. These supermicropores, which are in the range of 30-60 A [5], allow the introduction of the relatively large organometallic molecules. Moreover, zeolites have a high adsorption capacity, thus increasing the concentration of the reactants in the proximity of the active sites [6]. Finally, reactants can be preactivated when in zeolites, due to a confinement effect [ 7 ] through which the whole framework can contribute to activation by close contact and strong interaction with reactant molecules. This effect is caused by surface curvature and framework polarizabilities [8]. In the present work a series of rhodium(I) complexes with an a.mido ligand (L) (L = 2-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)aminocarbonylpyrrolidine) derived from L-proline, have been covalently anchored to a non-specific silica support and to an ultrastable Y-zeolite, and their activity and selectivity for C=C double bond hydrogenation are compared with those of the unsupported catalyst. Experimental Materials All solvents were dried before use. Ligand silane precursor, NHZ(CHZ)3Si(OEt)3, was distilled before use; other reagents were of G.R. grade. The inorganic supports were Merck silica 60 (particle size 63-200 j,m), and an ultrastable Y zeolite (USY) prepared by steam calcination at 1300 K of an 80% NH4+-exchanged NaY zeolite (SK-40, Union Carbide), followed by treatment with 1 N citric acid solution at 333 K for 30 min. The zeolite was then washed and dried at 403 K. The final zeolite exhibited a well-developed supermicropore system, as observed by N2 and Ar adsorption-desorption, while containing a large quantity of silanol groups, as observed by IR spectroscopy. Unit cell size = 24.40 A; bulk Si02/Al2O3 = 4.2; crystallinity= 95%. These supports were dried at 4lO15 K under reduced pressure (0.01 mm/Hg) for 3 h before the anchoring process. Infrared spectra were produced on Nicolet FT-ER XR60 and Perkin Elmer 681 spectrophotometers. Elemental analysis of C, H, N was performed by the Analytical Department of the Institute of Organic Chemistry (C.S.I.C.) Madrid, with a Heraeus instrument. Rhodium content was analyzed by atomic absorption measurement. Synthesis of ligands A solution of (L)-N-carbobenzoxyproline (3.7 g, 13 mmol) and triethylamine (1.51 g, 13 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran was cooled in an ice bath. Ethyl chloroformate (1.64 g, 13 mmol) was added dropwise with vigorous stirring and the pasty reaction mixture stirred for an additional 30 min (temp. 371 5-10 C), obtaining in situ the mixed anhydride. A solution of (15 mmol) of the corresponding amine was added dropwise over 15 min. After 1 h, the mixture was filtered and the solid washed with ethyl acetate. The filtrate and washing liquids were evaporated at reduced pressure, the residue was redissolved in ethyl acetate and rapidly washed with water, an aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, and brine. Temperatures should not exceed 35 C during evaporation if crosslinldng of the silane is to be avoided (yield 80O). A mixture of a previously obtained pyrrolidine (13.3 mmol), cyclohexene (2 g, 24 mmol) and 0.1 g of commercial Pd/C (10'0) in 30 ml of ethanol was refluxed for 15-30 min in argon atmosphere, cooled and filtered. The catalyst was washed with ethanol, and filtrate and washing liquids were evaporated under reduced pressure to give the unprotected amide (yields > 980/0). Synthesis of complexes A solution of a ligand, prepared as above, in CH2Cl2 (0.6 mmol) was added to a solution of rhodium complex precursor, [Rh(COD)Cl]2, [Rh(COVl]2 or RhCI(PPh3)3 (0.4 mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 deoxygenated with argon, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h at room temperature in inert atmosphere. Evaporation to dryness under reduced pressure produces an oily compound, which after being washed several times with ethyl ether, leaves the yellow-orange neutral compound, in which the chlorine atom is coordinated to the metal. The corresponding cationic complexes have been obtained by a similar procedure by adding an equimolar amount of NHqPFg to the starting reaction mixture. Anchoring of rhodium complexes to silica and USY zeolites Attachment to the support was carried out by reaction of the triethoxysilyl moiety of the ligand L with the hydroxyl groups of the supports according to Scheme 1. The structure of the supported complex was deduced from analytical and spectroscopic data. The coordination sphere around the metal is the same for the unsupported complexes under these reaction conditions [9, 10]. 0 0 0 ~HR ISUPI ~H(CH2)3Si-4SUP( L-Proline-1 ~HR ~Rh# L,. ` L2 L1 ''' -L2 to,b-3o,b S11-la.b - Sil-3o.b LI,L2 - COD; CO,CO; PPh3,PPh3 Zeol-1a,b - Zeol-3a,b JRhI - a: Rh-CI; b: Rh+ R - C(CH3)3; (CH 2)3-Si(OC2H5)3 Scheme 1. 372 In a typical experiment, a solution of 100-120 mg (0.17-0.21 meq Rh) of complex la,b-3a,b in dry CH2C12 was added to a suspension of 1 g of silica or zeolite in 50 ml of toluene. The mixture was stirred under argon at room temperature for 24 h. The solvent was decanted and the resulting pale yellow solid was Soxhlet-extracted with CH2C12/ethyl ether (1 /2) for 24 h. The products were dried at reduced pressure. We avoided extraction with toluene because some catalysts blacken while the extraction takes place, indicating the presence of Rh particles which can be detected by TEM. Experiments at 48 h reaction have shown that the metal loading does not significantly increase after 24 h. The rhodium contents and elemental analysis of the immobilized catalysts are given in Table 1. Catalytic experiments 1-Hexene, cyclohexene and 1-methylcyclohexene (high purity Merck) have been hydrogenated in a batch reactor (Autoclave Engineers) of 100 ml capacity, at 323 and 373 K reaction temperature and 6 atm. of hydrogen pressure, the molar ratio Rh/substrate being 1 /1000. The olefins were added to a solution or suspension of the catalyst in methyl isobutyl ketone (50 ml). After hydrogenation, the catalyst, when supported, was separated by filtration and used again. The reaction products were analyzed in a gas-liquid Siemens apparatus using a 1 /2 inch/4 m column packed with /3, /3'-oxydipropionitrile, at 317 K. Total conversion was achieved in 1--4 h for all catalysts.

Anchored complexes were obtained starting from triethoxysilylpropyl complexes and by controlled hydrolysis of the Si-OEt groups of the complexes with the free silanols Si-OH of either the silica or the modified USY-zeolite. With silica gel as support, and due to the large quantity of surface silanols, concentration of the metal complex on the surface was controlled using a solution with a suitable amount of rhodium complex. For these concentrations of Rh (1-2%) the anchorage efficiency is 10090. The amount of metal uptake was checked by elemental analysis (C, H, N, Rh) after washing the sample with ethyl ether/dichloromethane in a Soxhlet for 24 h. In order to study the influence of the anchoring procedure, two preparative routes were followed. The first followed the sequence: ligand-> complex - anchored complex, whilst in a second procedure, the amide functionalized support was prepared first, followed by reaction with the metal complex. Complexes obtained by the first route can be characterized by standard methods in molecular chemistry, whilst the main disadvantage with the second route is the difficulty in characterizing the supported product. Thus we generally preferred the first route. Nevertheless we have obtained similar metal loading and catalytic activities. In order to study the influence of the support on the intrinsic activity of the anchored complexes, as well as the surface concentration effect and geometrical constraints, when using zeolites as support, three different olefins were studied: I-hexene, cyclohexene and 1-methylcyclohexene, with a wide spread of steric bulkiness, for complexes la-b in solution and anchored on silica and USY-zeolite. Hydrogion of 1-hexO The results for the hydrogenation of 1-hexene using the homogeneous cationic complex lb at 323 K shows 100% conversion after 160 min with an induction period of 40 min. When the complex was supported on silica, Sil-lb, and the reaction was carried out at 323 K, the induction period decreased (30 min) but a longer time was needed (350 min) to achieve total conversion. However, when the cationic complex was anchored on the USYzeolite, Zeol-lb, and used as catalyst for 1-hexene hydrogenation, no induction period was observed at 323 K, while complete hydrogenation was achieved after 100 min (Table 2, Fig. 1). Thus, for 1-hexene reduction, the cationic complex 1b supported on zeolite Zeol-1b is more active (larger initial and maximum rates) than when supported on silica or when unsupported. Therefore it seems that the enhanced surface concentration effect [61 and/or an electrical interaction between the 374 TABLE 2 Hydrogenation of 1-hexene in the presence of several homogeneous and immobilized rhodium catalysts Catalyst T Induction vo vmM Total conv.

Mg. 1. Hydrogenation of 1-hexene with cationic catalysts. substrate and the zeolite support could indeed be responsible for both the absence of induction effect and its higher activity. The isomerization of hexene-1 to cis-2-hexene was only observed at low conversion and an induction period was detected. For longer reaction times cis-2-hexene was also hydrogenated, showing the typical behaviour of a primary unstable product under our reaction conditions. 375 When compared, the neutral and cationic complexes present similar kinetic numbers, i.e. induction period, initial and maximum rates, in homogeneous and supported media. The complexes anchored on USY zeolite were the most active. Furthermore, the activity of these neutral or cationic heterogenized catalysts did not decrease after ten runs (Table 2). When hydrogenation experiments were carried out at 373 K, a slightly higher rate of reaction was observed for all catalysts together with a marked reduction in induction period (Table 2). Hydrogenation of cyclohexene and 1-methylcyclohexene From their physicochemical characteristics, one would expect cyclohexene to be hydrogenated more quickly than 1-hexene and much more slowly than 1-methylcyclohexene. However the fact that 1-methylcyclohexene is a more bulky molecule than cyclohexene could also have some influence on the final catalytic activity, due to restrictions of the interaction of the cycloalkenes with the organometallic complex, as has been claimed for Wilkinson's type catalysts [ 111. Additionally, the geometrical constraints could be expected to increase from homogeneous - silica- - zeolite-supported catalysts. The kinetic parameters for a series of homogeneous and supported catalysts for hydrogenation of cyclohexene and methylcyclohexene are given in Tables 3 and 4 respectively. It can be seen that cyclohexene is indeed hydrogenated more quickly than 1-hexene on the homogeneous catalysts, and for 1-methylcyclohexene maximum rates are similar for all catalysts studied. Moreover the order of activity for cyclohexene also follows the order: zeolite-supported > homogeneous > silica-supported, the shape of the kinetic curves being similar to those obtained for the hydrogenation of 1-hexene (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, as shown in Table 5, the hexene/cyclohexene hydrogenation ratio is lower for the homogeneous catalyst than for the silica-supported one, and even lower than for the zeolite-supported. This result may indicate that in general geometrical constraints for bulkier molecules follow the expected order: zeolite-supported > silica-supported > homogeneous.

These results agree with those previously reported on the effect of supporting 377 complexes on solid carriers. On the contrary, the results observed when using a USY-zeolite as support indicate that there is no detectable induction period, and the maximum rates increase dramatically for both neutral and cationic catalysts. Since the main differences between the silica and USYzeolite are the presence of strong electric fields and cavities in the latter, we believe that the observed phenomena could be related to both concentration effect and charge interactions with the surface. It must be pointed out that one cannot expect the whole zeolite to participate in this process, but mainly the most external open cavities, which form supermicropores and contain the anchored complexes. The supermicropores and mesopores are formed during steam dealumination [ 12 ]. Their pore size distribution has been obtained by N2 adsorption-desorption and the results are presented in Fig. 3. On the other hand, the introduction of a methyl group attached to a double bond when using 1-methylcyclohexene instead of cyclohexene causes a decrease in the hydrogenation rate, even for the homogeneous catalyst. Moreover, this decrease is much higher in the case of the zeolite-supported one; similar rates are observed for all catalysts, supported and unsupported. This fact indicates that when geometrical constraints for the coordination of the olefin to the metal become critical, the geometrical limitations due to the carrier become secondary. From a mechanistic point of view, the structural changes occurring during olefin hydrogenation on the homogeneous and supported catalysts were followed by IR spectroscopy (Table 6).

Samples of supported catalysts were taken after the last run and dried in vacuo. 2000-2100 cm-1 after olefin hydrogenation proves the existence of metal hydrides and indicate that the Rh(I) complexes are transformed to Rh(III) compounds during the reaction. Taking into account the similarity in the kinetic curves for hydrogenation on the homogeneous and heterogenized catalysts, it can be assumed that similar reaction intermediates are involved in both types of catalyst, the controlling step being the formation of an intermediate Rh(III) hydride. Thus the hydrogenation mechanism on these catalysts probably involves a stepwise rather than a concerted mechanism. Indeed, the fact that the complex remains firmly bonded to the support during the reaction implies that the amide group (identified by CO stretching in the IR spectra) remains throughout bound to the rhodium. The same applies to the halide ligand and PF6- in the neutral and cationic complexes respectively. Conclusions Both neutral and cationic complexes of the type: [RhCl(COD)L] (1a), [Rh(COD)(L)]+ (lb), [RhCI(CO)ZL] (2a), [RhCl(PPh3)Z(L)] (3a) and [Rh(PPh3)Z(L)]+ (3b), where L is 2-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)aminocarbonylpyrrolidine, are active for olefin hydrogenation. While anchorage on silica produces in all cases a decrease in activity, anchorage on USY-zeolite containing supermicropores and a large quantity of silanol groups increases the original activity. Geometrical constraints due to the size of the olefin have a strong impact on the reaction rate. The supported complexes are quite stable over prolonged reaction times and presence of traces of oxygen in the feedstock. The high activity observed with these supported complexes, plus the fact that prolonged activity can be achieved in continuous operation without detectable loss of Rh from the support, indicates that these are truly heterogeneous counterparts of homogeneous transition metal complex catalysts. 379 Acknowledgements Financial support from the Direcci6n de Investigaci6n Cientifica y Wcnica (Project MAT-0147) is gratefully acknowledged.

Corma C. del Pino Inst. de Tecnologiá Química, Camino Vera s/n, 46071 Valencia Spain New rhodium complexes of formula [RhCl(COD)L], [RhCl(CO)2L], [Rh(PPh3)2L] and the corresponding cationic ones, where L = 2-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)aminocarbonyl-pyrrolidine, have been covalently bound to silica and ultrastable Y-zeolite containing supermicropores. The complexes anchored on the zeolite show a higher activity for alkene hydrogenation than the free complexes in homogeneous medium, the silica-anchored catalysts being the least active. No loss in hydrogenation activity was observed with the complexes immobilized on zeolite after ten recycles, and the leaching of metal was not appreciable; thus they represent a truly heterogeneous counterpart to homogeneous transition metal complex catalysts.
