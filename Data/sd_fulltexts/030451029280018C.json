Albert Einstein, 69626 Yilleurbanne, Cedex (Prance) and Dominique Huchette Centre de Recherches du Nord, ORKEM, 62670 Mazingarbe (France) (Received February 5, 1991; accepted March 20, 1991) Abstract A mechanism and rate expressions are proposed to explain the conversion kinetics of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid by oxidative dehydrogenation on several iron phosphate catalysts. The relation between the catalyst nature and rate constants led us to suggest improvements in the catalysts and in reaction conditions. The mechanism proposed involves surface hydroxyl groups and sites composed of two nearby Fe cations. It corresponds to a new extension of the well-known Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism, often postulated for partial oxidation reactions on oxides. Introduction Methyl methacrylate is an essential monomer in the manufacture of plastic resins and fibers. Alternative processes to produce this monomer are studied today all over the world. Among them, an attractive one involves the esterification of methacrylic acid produced by oxydehydrogenation of isobutyric acid obtained by hydroformylation of propene. Two types of catalyst have been proposed for isobutyric acid oxidative dehydrogenation: iron phosphates [ 1, 2 ] and heteropolyanions [3-51. Few studies on iron phosphates have been published thus far except in the patent literature. We have therefore undertaken to study in more detail the oxydehydrogenation reaction of isobutyric acid on Fe-P-O catalysts. The ternary system Fe203-FeO_P205 has recently been studied [6, 7]. It exhibits different phases which contain both ferric and ferrous ions, suggesting possible utilisation for partial oxidation reactions involving a redox mechanism. New phases such as Fe3(P04)03, Fe4(PO4)20, Fe9(P04)0s and 'Present address: Laboratoire de Genie Catalytique des Reacteurs de Raffinage.

All rights reserved 200 Fe2(P04)O have been characterized [8-12] and some of them have been studied as catalysts in the oxidation of propene [ 13 ]. In this reaction, phosphates and oxyphosphates exhibit the usual properties of oxidation catalysts and can activate oxygen. Important differences in catalytical properties have been related to the crystallographic structures [ 13 ]. A recent study of various phosphates in the conversion of ethylbenzene to styrene [ 14 ] has shown that these solids could act as oxydehydrogenating catalysts, but the proposed mechanism, which suggests a phosphate ester and a phenethanol as intermediates, involves essentially the acidic properties of the catalyst [14]. However the data presented here strongly suggest that the redox properties of the catalyst play an important role that must be taken into account, as is usual for partial oxidation reactions. A recent paper shows also that FePO catalysts may be used for the oxidative coupling of methane at a relatively low temperature (575 C) [15]. A complete kinetic study of the catalytic oxydehydrogenation of isobutyric acid on various phosphates would be useful to obtain information on the mechanism of the reaction and to determine which characteristics of the catalyst are needed to increase the yield of methacrylic acid. Our first results in this attempt have shown the important role of added water vapour pressure [ 16 ] and the important effect of the nature of the solid on the catalytic properties, while the evolution of the catalyst crystalline structure during the reaction has also been evidenced [ 17 ]. Experimental Catalyst preparation Different pure and well-characterized solids were prepared.

Special heat treatments under vacuum or H20-H2-N2 gas mixtures were necessary to prepare the other mixed-valence phosphates [ 7-9 ]. An industrial type catalyst containing an alkaline element in addition to Fe and P, has been supplied by OI1rKEM and will be referred to as Ind. cat.' [ 18 ]. Purity and crystallinity of the samples were checked by chemical analysis and X-Ray diffraction. B.E.T. surface area measurements were performed on a volumetric apparatus by adsorption of nitrogen at liquid nitrogen temperature. Kinetic study A special device was built for this study as described in [16]. The main difficulty was to avoid the polymerization of methacrylic acid. The online analysis of 02, N2, CO, C02, H20, propene, acetone and acetic, propenoic, methacrylic and isobutyric acids allowed control of the mass blance. The device could be used as a differential flow reactor (low conversion) to study the effect of 02, isobutyric acid (IBA) and water relative partial pressures on the reaction rate at the steady state of the reaction. It could also be used as an integral flow reactor to obtain an important conversion and to measure selectivity vs. conversion at a constant temperature. The degradation of the reaction products could be measured without drastically increasing the conversion, but only by adding these products at the reactor inlet. In the range of reaction conditions investigated, methacrylic acid O), acetone, propene and COZ were found as reaction products over all investigated catalysts. 202 After the steady state of the reaction was reached, the isobutyric acid flow was stopped to observe the decrease with time of the partial pressure of this acid and of the reaction products. By comparison with a blank reaction obtained without catalyst, it was possible to estimate the quantities retained on the catalyst. In the same way, by stopping the oxygen flow, it was possible to estimate the amount of lattice or adsorbed oxygen consumed by the reactant molecules. Results Steady state kinetics The activity of the various catalysts was stable with time on stream for several days. Only Fe5P3015 exhibited a low and regular selectivity decrease with time (about 6% per day). The variations in conversion vs. contact time were plotted and are presented in Fig. 2. The linear part of the curve indicates that the reaction rate is chemically controlled and that the effect of product pressures is not very important, at least when the conversion is lower than 30ss'o, and has been neglected. The influence of oxygen and isobutyric acid partial pressures on the reaction rate at low conversion ( < 10ss'o) is shown in Fig. 3. The shapes of these curves are compatible with a redox or steady state mechanism [20], except that corresponding to Fe2P05a, which does not allow elimination in this case of the hypothesis of adsorption of isobutyric acid. The variation of the partial pressure of water in the investigation range (0-77 kPa) has practically no influence on the selectivities. Only a small increase in the selectivities in C02 (from 5ss'o to 10ss'o) are observed at very low water partial pressure. 80 60 -~ 40 O ~r~~T'~ T ~T~~ r 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 m/D (mg.&cm-3) Fig. 2.

For each solid tested a different maximum reaction rate was observed. This maximum of the rate with water pressure seems to depend on the catalyst and suggests two effects of water pressure. At low pressure the rate increased, i.e. water has a catalytic effect. For higher pressures, the rate decreased. As water is a reaction product, it is possible that it intervenes in an equilibrium step or in a reverse reaction step. The effect of temperature on the reaction rate is traditionally expressed by an apparent activation energy (Table 2). The values obtained depend on the catalysts. Some very low values, particularly in the acetone formation, suggest an equilibrium step (possibly adsorption) in the acetone formation route. In this case the OHO value of the equilibrium could add to the activation energy to give a low apparent activation energy value. Transient kinetics Hydrocarbon The variations of the product pressures with time on stream for three solids (FeZPZO7, Fe7(POq)6 and the industrial catalyst), after the isobutyric acid feed was stopped at t = O, are shown in Fig. 5.

This observation is compatible with an absorption of this acid on the catalyst. For all the solids, propene, acetone and methacrylic acid relative pressures decreased rapidly below the detection limit except for Fe2P207, with which an unexpected increase in propene was observed. The decrease in propene and acetone formation occurred more rapidly than that of isobutyric and methacrylic acids, suggesting that intermediate stabilities are lower for propene or acetone. Isobutyric acid adsorption in molecular form is not excluded. In this case the adsorption sites could be different from the active sites. The integration of areas under the methacrylic acid curves give an estimate of the sum of methacrylic acid adsorption, intermediate adsorption, and the quantities of isobutyric acid adsorbed which could react before desorbing. The latter quantity is important and approaches the equivalent of the complete monolayer of the catalyst surface (Table 3, column 2). An important intermediate concentration on the solid surface is thus evidenced.

Oxygen The evolution of the relative pressure of products after stopping the oxygen and water flows is shown in Fig. 5b. It can be seen that the decreases in these pressures are slower than those observed after stopping isobutyric 207 TABLE 3 Estimated values of superficial concentration from transient kinetics at 673 K, PIRA=5.26 kPa, Poz = 5.26 kPa, P ,0 = 75 kPa Sample Superficial concentration Removable oxygen of adsorbed IBA (mmol m-z) (wt.%) Number of atomic layers Fe7(P04)6 24 12 340 Fe2P207 3 24 70 Ind. cat. 0.3 12 60 'Calculated assuming oxygen ion area 7.8 AZ. acid feed. This indicates that the solids are able to release a very large amount of oxygen (Table 3, column 3), i.e. that lattice oxygen intervenes in the reaction, as is usually observed in partial oxidation catalysis, even from the bulk. Acetone formation decreases more rapidly than those of the other products after oxygen flow stops, showing that oxygen sites for this product are the most easily reduced. Propene formation decreases more slowly and thus is less affected by the surface reduction. Note that propene and acetone formation stopped while that of methacrylic acid continued. These observations show that propene, methacrylic acid and acetone are probably formed on different sites. Kinetic model Kinetic expression The various observations described above suggest that the catalyst works as an oxidation catalyst via the well-known Mars and Van Krevelen steady state mechanism [21]. The amount of oxygen that could be removed from the solid is high, i.e. the catalyst could be deeply reduced [20]. Let us recall that a Mars and Van Krevelen type mechanism was also found in isobutyric acid oxydehydrogenation on heteropolyanions [5]. However the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism does not take into account the retention of adsorbed isobutyric acid and the effect of water partial pressure. The increase in the rate with increasing water vapour pressure suggests that water creates active sites. On the oxide surface, water is expected to form hydroxyl groups, thus the effect of water and oxygen partial pressures suggests that active sites of the catalyst probably involve hydroxyl groups and Fe3+ ions. The decreases of the rate with high water pressure may reveal an equilibrium step with water as a product or a reverse step. The oxido-reduction equilibration of the reaction shows that two Fe\" ions must be reduced to Fe\" to form one methacrylic acid molecule. Taking into account all these facts, the formal kinetic scheme shown in Fig. 6 is 208 2 p2- + H20 ~ 2 OH- Ko P H20 C4H802 + OH- + Fe3+Fe3+k 1 k,1 15+ + H20 V1=k16oeOH-PC4HSO2 - k'191PH20 15+ + OH- !~_ C4H602 + H20 + Fe2+Fe2+ K2 = PH20 PC4H602Br 91 60H Fe2+Fe2+ + 02 k3 Fe3+Fe3+ + 02-+ Oads V3 = k3er P02 Fe2+Fe2+ + Oads Fe3+Fe3+ + 02- and VCqHg02 = Mk3PC4Hg02 PH201 /2 P02 MPC4Hg02PH201/2 + k3P02 + LPH203/2PC4H602 _ k'1 k1k'1 ML= K2 with M k1 Kp L K Ko Fig. 6.

There is no difficulty in establishing the rate expression (Fig. 6) with the hypothesis that the superficial concentration eo+ Or=1. No simplification of this rate expression could be found if a good fit is to be obtained with the experimental data, particularly with the shape of the curve exhibiting a maximum as a function of water pressure. Constant determination The proposed rate expression shows that the rate depends on three independent constants, namelyM (M=kl~K_O),L (L=k'1/K2~K_o) and k3 (Fig. 6). It is not possible to determine the five basic Idnetic constants KO, kl, k' 1, KZ and k3 by kinetic measurements alone. The three independent constants M, L and k3 are determined by nonlinear regression, using a simplex method with the experimental data shown in Fig. 4; the values obtained are given in Table 4. It is noteworthy that the k3 constant which characterizes the catalyst reoxidation changes strongly with the catalyst. The minimum value of k3 is obtained with Fe2PObb, which exhibits the best electronic conductivity and ability for facile electron exchange [ 12 ]. In this case the whole crystal could be somewhat reduced but not deeply. Superficial sites may then activate a rapid oxidation by oxygen. Fe2P207 contains only Fe 2+ ions and could not be easily reduced further. This phase may be considered as the support for an oxidized phase which seems very active with oxygen. The Fe2P207 phase is an insulator, so the 209 TABLE 4 Kinetic constants determined from Fig. 4; data fitted to the mechanistics scheme shown in Fig. 6 Sample M=k~Vi~o k3 L=k',/(KZ~Ko) ML=k,k',lKZ Fe2P207 0.35 325 0.100 0.035 Fe2PO5b 0.40 9 0.004 0.0016 Fe7(PO4)e 1.20 73 0.250 0.3 FeP04 2.30 62 0.025 0.058 Ind. cat. 4.65 72 0.070 0.325 N 300 p 200 00 100 o 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 M.L.10 Fig. 7.

The amount of surface-oxidized phase may be estimated by the transient kinetics and turns out to be very large (Table 3). The discussion on M and L values is more difficult because these constants have no physical meaning. The values of the kinetic constants (Table 4) could be discussed in terms of the properties of the solids. The constant M is the product of the kl constant of the supposed slow reduction step with the square root of Ko, the water ionisation equilibrium constant. For an efficient catalyst these two constants must be large, i.e. their product M must also be large. A good catalyst should also have a small k' 1 and a large KZ constant, which leads to a small L constant. No correlation appears between the catalyst activity and the values of k3, M or M/L, which, as shown by the kinetic equations, must all be large to result in high rates. On the contrary, the product ML=klk'1/KZ was found to correlate well with the catalytic activity, as shown in Fig. 7. The k', /KZ ratio is expected not to change very much with I5+ stability, which suggests that the kl constant may change significantly with the catalyst nature and 210 could vary as the ML values. With such a hypothesis one may conclude that the industrial catalyst is the most active sample in forming the I5+ intermediate and that more efficient catalysts may be hopefully prepared, since the maximum L and M values were not obtained for the same catalyst (Table 4). Discussion A good fit has been obtained between the model proposed and the kinetic results. It is however necessary to determine whether this model agrees with the chemical properties of the various solids, or if a possible chemical mechanism could support this model. The interaction of an isobutyric acid molecule with a surface Fe\" ion may involve the oxygen atom, which corresponds to the nucleophilic part of the molecule. Reduction with the formation of a first water molecule could be due to a cyclic concerted electron transfer starting from the nucleophilic surface hydroxyl group to one of the hydrogen atoms of the isobutyric acid molecule, creating a double bond in the molecule and opening the C-O bond to a C-O-Fe bond. Thus the intermediate species I5+ at the catalyst surface could be an iron alkoxide, as schematized in Fig. 6. Various reaction routes could be described involving different hydrogen atoms susceptible to react with the first hydroxyl groups (Fig. 8, routes 2a, 2b, 2c). The first and most probable is the reaction of the surface hydroxyl groups with the H atom adjacent to the C=O bond (Fig. 8, 2a). A second possibility is the attack of the acidic hydrogen of a superficial isobutyrate (Fig. 8, 2c). A third way, corresponding to initial reaction of the hydroxyl group with the methyl hydrogen, seems less probable. In this first step the surface ferric ion is reduced to Fee+. However, as the solids are both electronic and ionic conductors, it is possible that this surface ion remains at the 3 + oxidation state and that another cation is reduced to 2+. Such an equilibrium between Fe 2+ and Fe\" would permit a second cyclic concerted electron transfer to produce the second water molecule and liberate the product from the catalytic surface. In the 2a case, reaction of the hydroxyl with a methyl hydrogen gives the methacrylic acid molecule. In the 2c case, the same reaction gives propene and C02 molecules. This could explain the formation of the propene product. The route to propene proposed in several studies on other types of catalyst involves acidic decomposition of isobutyric acid, i.e. the reverse of the propene carbonylation reaction [3, 22]: (CH3)2-CH-COOH- CH3-CH=CH2+CO+H20 It is interesting at this point to note that the study of the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid on VPO catalyst has been studied and that propene was the main byproduct on these catalysts [3]. Moreover, propene selectivity has been shown to increase with the P/V ratio of the catalysts. It is known that the acidity of these solids increases when the II (1) 02- O-H Fe3+ K, OII- OH- Fe3+ +1120 +H20 CH3 (2 a) C113 CH3 CH3 H2-C=C-IC-O-H 112-C-C-C-O-H H2-C-C=C-O-H H2-C-C-C-O-H 0 I I.~ II I I I~ C>I H H O~ H O H O OH- OH-~O Fe3+ OH- kl OH- O Fe2+ OII- OH- t O Fe3~ OH- K2 OII- O Fe2+ OH- ______________ FC3+_________ k 1-- F~+ ~___ __ Fe3+ - _______Fe3*_________ Fe3+ Fe3+ Fe2+ Fe2+ (2 A) C113 CH3 +H20 CH3 i H3 +H20 H2-C-C-C-O-H 112-C-C-C-O-Ii H2-C-C-C-O H H3C-C C=O I IJ, II I I II I)II H H Ol H O H I O O O OH- OH-?O FCe3+ OH- OH- O Fe2+ OH- OH- 0 Fe3+ OH- OH- Fe3+ H .- 11'x. _ Fe3+ Fe3+ Fe3+ Fe2+ Fe3+ ~,Fe3+ Fe2+ Fe2+ (2c) CH3 C113 +H20 CH3 CH3 +H20 H2-C-C-C-O H H2-C-C-C=O H2-C C-C=O H2-C=C C=O I I II1 I I I I-~' I 41 I II H 11 O~ 11 H O (yH H O~ 11 O ____ 011-- OII- __ Fe ~ _ ~H ___ -H___ ~H __ F~____ ____ ~H_ ~H___ F~+ OH_____ _____ Fe3+ Fe3+ Fe2+ Fe2+ (3) Fe2+ Fe2+ + 02 k3 .

Such an observation should lead us to favour this interpretation. However in our reaction conditions, formation of CO was not observed. This supports the mechanism of propene formation described above (Fig. 8, 2c). The propene formation could be favoured on solids which exhibit (i), a more labile acidic hydrogen, (ii) too great a distance between hydroxyls and Fe 3+ cations to allow reaction with the allylic hydrogen to take place, (iii) fewer hydroxyl groups at the surface. The latter case is supported by the observation that propene selectivity is higher at low water pressure. If the oxide surface contains oxygen ions not transformed into hydroxyls, they could interact with the carbon atom adjacent to the C-O-Fe bond of the adsorbed intermediate and contribute another bond to the surface (Fig. 8, 2b). In such a case there exists a second cyclic concerted electronic transfer, and acetone and COZ are formed. This explains how acetone yield increases when water pressure decreases and confirms that acetone is favoured on solids containing more labile oxygens (Table 2). Acknowledgements Dr. C.
