Rama Rao Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad 500 007, India Received 22 December 1994; revised 16 May 1995; accepted 28 August 1995 Abstract The acylation of phenol with acetic anhydride was carried out over different modified ZSM-5 catalysts. Co, Cu, and Ce showed a promoting effect. The best temperature and weight hourly space velocity for this reaction were found to be 250 and 0.5 h-~, respectively. ZSM-5(30) was found to be a better catalyst than ZSM-5(150) and ZSM-5(250) in the acylation of phenol. A plausible reaction mechanism is also discussed.

Introduction O-hydroxyacetophenone (o-HAP) and p-hydroxyacetophenone (p-HAP) are very useful intermediates for the manufacture of agrochemicals and pharmaceuti- cals, and are generally synthesized by the very popular Fries rearrangement or direct acylation of phenol [ 1-6]. The most widely used catalyst for Fries rearrange- ment is A1C13, but the inherent disadvantage is that it is required in equimolar ratio and involves a tedious work-up. Changing over to zeolites instead of using the environmentally hazardous A1C13 is more acceptable, because of their activity, selectivity and reusability and they do not pollute the environment [ 7-9 ]. Recently, Guisnet et al. have reported the vapour-phase acylation of phenol by taking acetic acid as acylating agent but the yields were not up to the mark [ 1,2].

Others are reporting the selective acylation of phenol with acetic anhydride over modified and unmodified ZSM-5 catalysts (Scheme 1 ) in good yields, and discuss the role of weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), temperature, molar ratio of Ac20 and plausible mechanism. 2. Experimental The phenol acylation reactions were carried out using a tubular down-flow reactor 20 mm in diameter. The cold reaction mixture (cold Ac20 was added to solid phenol in 1:1 molar ratio) was fed from the top using a syringe pump (Sage syringe pump, USA). The sized (18-30 mesh) catalyst (4.0 g) was loaded and activated at 450 for 4 h and tuned to the reaction temperature of 250. The products were collected at the bottom by circulating cold water. The products were quantified by gas chromatography (GC) using a SE30 (30%) column and confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC- MS). All the modified catalysts were synthesized by taking H-ZSM-5(30) and cor- responding metal salts. The amounts of cations used in the modification were 3-8 wt.-%. 18-30 mesh H-ZSM-5 (Si/A1--- 30), 4.0 g, was added to a solution of the metal salt in 50 ml of methanol/water. It was stirred occasionally for 10 h. Then the methanol / water was totally evaporated. The resultant M-ZSM-5 ( 30) ( M = Ce, CO, Cu, etc.) was activated at 450 for 4 h. 3. Results and discussions The acylation of phenol with Ac20 over different modified catalysts (Table 1 ) was carried out by taking phenol and Ac20 in equimolar amounts. All the catalysts were activated at 450 in air for 4 h before the reaction. The acylati~n results are very promising and the predominant product is o-HAP. In all the reactions the major side product is phenyl acetate (PA) resulting from the facile O-acylation of phenol. Traces of acetoxyacetophenone (AAP) were also observed. In all cases the mentioned conversion of phenol and the yields of PA and o-HAP are the best results at their respective time on stream. Interestingly, the o-HAP selectivity is > 95% in all the reactions. The high ortho selectivity is due to the reactive inter- mediate for the ortho-isomer being more stable.

In phenol acylation, the C- and O-acylation ratios at 70% conversion of phenol are 1.5, 0.94, 1.06, 1.59, 1.06, 0.94 for the catalysts ZSM-5(30), Cu-ZSM-5, Cr-ZSM-5, Ce- ZSM-5, Rh-ZSM-5 and Co-ZSM-5, respectively. These values show that the mod- ification of ZSM-5 (30) is leading to O-acylation except in the case of Ce-ZSM-5. Ce shows a promoting effect in C-acylation. The reaction of phenol with Ac20 was carded out over ZSM-5 catalysts with different Si/A1 ratio (Table 2). The ratio of SIO2/A1203 had a remarkable influ- ence on the acylation reaction. When the reaction was catalyzed by H-ZSM-5 (30), H-ZSM-5(150), H-ZSM-5(280) the yield of o-HAP was 41.76, 39.70 and 15.12, respectively. An increase in the ratio of Si/A1 resulted in a decrease of o-HAP, and on the other hand the O-acylation was increased. It means that C-acylation requires more BrCnsted acidity and lower acidity leading to phenyl acetate. The ortho selectivity was not influenced by the ratio of Si/AI. The non-zeolitic SiO2/AI203 acid catalyst (S.No.4) gave mostly phenyl acetate and there was no isomer selec- Table 2 Phenol acylation over ZSM-5 catalysts with different Si/A1 ratioS S.No. Catalyst TOS (h) Conversion of PA o-HAP p-HAP Othersb o-HAP:p-HAP phenol 1 H-ZSM-5 (30) 1 72.55 29.05 41.76 0.64 1.1 98.5:1.5 2 HSM-5(150) I 73.5 31.73 39.70 1,59 0.48 96.2:3.8 3 HSM-5(280) 1 56.75 40.91 15.12 0.26 0.46 98.3:1.7 4 SIO2/A1203 1 77.42 76.22 0.55 0.63 0.02 46.6:53.4 5 ZrO/La203 1 51.2 46.16 3.9 0.27 0.87 93.5:6.5 6 Zirconia sulphated 1 62.5 58.7 2.0 1.7 0.1 54.0:46.0 a Catalyst = 4.0 g; WHSV = 0.5 h- ~; Temperature = 250.

It shows that the C-acylation of phenol occurs in the channels of zeolites and not on the surface. The superacid catalyst, sulphated zirconia (682/01, MEL Chem- icals, UK) (S.No. 6) was also tested and found sluggish in the acylation of phenol. The role of the phenol to Ac20 ratio in acylation was studied (Table 3) in detail. These experiments reveal that the selectivity was governed by the molar ratio of acetic anhydride. Absolute isomeric selectivity was observed when the phenol to acetic anhydride ratio was 0.5 (S.No. 1 ). The ratio of o-HAP to p-HAP decreases to 1.65 with increase of acetic anhydride (S.No. 5). The molar ratio of Ac20 was adapted so as to increase the percentage of PA, but not the total percentage of acylated phenols. It shows that the formation of p-HAP and AAP depends upon the availability of excess acyl cation and partly proves that the reaction is going by direct C-acylation of phenol and not by Fries rearrangement. The acylation of phenol at different temperatures is depicted in Table 4. The suitable temperature for C-acylation of phenol is 250 (S.No. 2). At lower tem- perature, 200 (S.No. 1), the major product phenyl acetate comes from O-acy- lation. When the temperature is raised beyond 250 the conversion of phenol decreases. This may be due to the decomposition of phenyl acetate, i.e. backward reaction, to phenol. At higher temperatures aromatics were also observed. The formation of p-HAP and AAP was increased with time on stream. In ZSM- 5(150) catalyzed phenol acylation the ortho:para selectivities are 96.2:3.8, 82.6:17.4 and 76.3:23.7 at times on stream of 1, 2 and 3 h, respectively.

The plausible mechanistic routes are shown in Scheme 2. Route 3 can be ruled out because, due to the restricted geometry of the channels it should give more para isomer and AAP, which is contrary to the obtained results. O-acylation is very facile and based on the ratio of PA to o-HAP (3.85) [3] and phenol to o-HAP (0.65), it can be concluded that the o-HAP is formed by C-acylation (route 2) rather than by O-acylation and subsequent rearrangement, but parallel reactions cannot be ruled out. In summing up, the modified and unmodified ZSM-5 (30) catalysts were better in selective acylation of phenol to o-hydroxyacetophenone. Cerium shows a pro- moting effect in C-acylation. An increased molar ratio of acetic anhydride to phenol leads to more para isomer formation. The formation of p-HAP and AAP increased with time on stream due to coking. The best temperature for acylation of phenol was 250. Thus the present catalysts, which offer high selectivity, reusability and environmental safety, represent a potential alternative for industry.
