Graphical abstract We successfully prepared copper-based magnetic catalysts combining copper oxide and magnetite nanoparticles. These systems are active and selective in the oxidative homocoupling reaction of phenylacetylene in the absence of an external base. These systems are particularly interesting since the addition of an external base induces copper leaching by production of soluble molecular copper-base complexes. Some of these systems were also supported on oxidized few layer graphene to investigate a potential role of this support. We discover that this supported system is three times more active than the other ones. We propose that the role of graphene support is to improve catalyst dispersion, but also to provide a favorable micro-environment around the active phase via a pre-adsorption of the substrate on the support, which affords a substrate rich micro-environment around the active particles. Recycling experiments show that the graphene-supported systems cannot be recycled, while the other ones can. This result could be explained by a competitive pre-adsorption between the substrate and the product of the reaction on the surface of the support. Keywords Copper Magnetite Graphene Homocoupling Phenylacetylene 1 Introduction 1,3-Diynes derivatives constitute an important class of compounds present in natural products [1], molecular complexes [2] and polymers [3]. In addition, they are utilized as starting materials in the synthesis of substituted heterocyclic compounds [4–7]. A practical approach to the synthesis 1,3-diynes is thus desirable, and transition metal catalyzed oxidative cross-coupling of alkynes has emerged as a potential candidate [8]. More particularly, symmetrical 1,3-diynes are generally synthesized via oxidative homocoupling reactions with copper salts. Originally developed with stoichiometric amounts of copper(II) [9], these reactions were rendered catalytic by the addition of a base and dioxygen [10–12]. Milder reaction conditions in air have also been disclosed with palladium(II) and copper(I) salts as a co-catalysts [13–15]. However, recent efforts to develop efficient processes more respectful of the environment have led to the study of base-free copper catalytic systems [16,17], as we well as solvent-free systems [18,19]. Nonetheless, these catalytic systems still suffer from usual shortcomings of homogeneous catalysis, such as catalyst/products separations and recyclability of the catalyst. Even though numerous catalysts for alkyne homocoupling reaction have been reported, heterogeneous processes remain under-developed. Few heterogeneous oxidative homocoupling of alkynes have been reported[20] and most require the use of an external base [20–23], the combination of an external base and dioxygen [24], or catalytic amount of base and air [25]. More recently, efficient base free catalytic systems have been disclosed, still requiring however a dioxygen atmosphere [26–28]. These systems are particularly interesting since the addition of an external base induces copper leaching by production of soluble molecular copper-base complexes, which have been reported to be the active catalytic species [29]. Such catalytic systems can be further improved by seeking even simpler systems, which do not necessitate any additives and use air as an oxidant. Only two recent reports describe the utilization of a copper-based heterogeneous catalyst (Cu-TiO2 [30], and Cu/MnOx [31]) for the oxidative homocoupling reaction of alkynes without any additives. As no oxidative homocoupling of terminal alkynes proceeds with only bulk copper oxide such as CuO, Cu2O and Cu(OH)2 [26], we envisioned utilizing a nano-structured catalytic system [32,33]. To address the sustainability and the cost of the entire catalytic processes, we chose to take advantage of magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4) as an interesting alternative to solve the recovery and recycling issues deriving from the small size of these nanocatalysts [34,35]. Herein we report the synthesis of magnetic Cu-based nanoparticles and their utilization in the oxidative homocoupling reaction of phenylacetylene (Scheme 1 ). 2 Experimental section Commercially available compounds were purchased and used without further purification unless otherwise stated. The suppliers of the chemicals are listed in Table S1. NMR experiments were carried out with a Bruker Advance 300MHz spectrometer, using deuterated chloroform as solvent. Compound 1 was synthesized according to the reported procedure [36], and fully characterized by 1H, 13C NMR spectroscopy and GC–MS. 2.1 Catalyst characterization Morphology and structure investigations were performed by TEM on a JEM 1011 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 100kV. The particles size distributions were obtained from measurements of at least 250 particles. The BET surface area were determined by nitrogen adsorption, using a single point ThermoQuest Surface Area Analizer Qsurf S1. XPS measurements were performed on a VG Microtech ESCA 3000 Multilab, equipped with a dual Mg/Al anode. The spectra were excited by the unmonochromatised Al Kα source (1486eV 9 run at 14kV and 15mA). The samples were analyzed as powders mounted on a double-sided adhesive tape. FT-IR spectra were recorded with an IR Perkin Elmer Spectrum One Spectrophotometer, using an Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR). Micro Raman spectroscopy was performed on a Raman Invia Renishaw spectrometer equipped with CCD detector and Leica microscopy using a x50 objective lens. The X-Ray-diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a Thermo ARL X’TRA powder diffractometer, operating in the Bragg-Brentano geometry and equipped with a Cu-anode X-Ray source (Kα, λ=1.5418Å), using a Peltier Si(Li) cooled solid state detector. TGA analysis were performed with a SETARAM 92-16.18 Thermobalance from room temperature to 1000°C with a rate of 10°C/min. The analyses were carried out in air. Magnetic measurements were carried out with a Quantum Design MPMS 5XL SQUID, which uses Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) Magnetometer to monitor changes in magnetic flux. Data can be collected between H=0 to±50kOe and T=1.7K to 400K. The analyses were conducted at room temperature. The metal content was determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) with a Spectro-Genesis instrument. 2.2 Material synthesis The microwave synthesis were performed with a CEM Discover S-class system. The instrument consists of a single mode cavity with continuous power generation and control of power supply. It is capable of supplying power in 1W increments from 0 to 300W. The system is equipped with a vertically focused IR temperature sensor. 2.2.1 Fe3O4 In a typical experiment the desired amount of Fe(OAc)2 (1g, 5.8mmol) was dissolved in deaerated EtOH 96wt% (44mL). The solution was then thermally treated at 120°C for 15min at 250W by mono-mode microwave (80mL vessel). The product was then magnetically recovered using a neodymium magnet and washed three times with EtOH 96wt% (total volume of 210mL). The solid phase was recovered using a neodymium magnet, dried under vacuum for 10h and stored under inert atmosphere. 2.2.2 CuOx[ac]/Fe3O4 In a typical experiment, the desired amount of Fe(OAc)2 (1g, 5.8mmol) and Cu(OAc)2 (63mg, 0.35mmol) were dissolved in deaerated EtOH 96wt% (44mL). This solution was thermally treated at 120°C for 15min at 250W by mono-mode microwave (80mL glass vessel). The product was then filtered and washed three times with EtOH 96wt% (total volume of 210mL). The solid phase was magnetically recovered using a neodymium magnet, dried under vacuum for 10h and stored under inert atmosphere. 2.2.3 CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4 In a typical experiment, the desired amount of Fe(OAc)2 (1g, 5.8mmol) and Cu2(O2CNEt2)4·2NHEt2 (130mg, 0.2mmol) were dissolved in deaerated EtOH 96wt% (44mL). This solution was thermally treated at 120°C for 15min at 250W by mono-mode microwave (80mL glass vessel). The product was then filtered and washed three times with EtOH 96wt% (overall amount 210mL). The solid phase was magnetically recovered using a neodymium magnet, dried under vacuum for 10h and stored under inert atmosphere. 2.2.4 CuOx[ca]@Fe3O4 In a typical experiment, the desired amount of Fe(OAc)2 (1g, 5.8mmol) was dissolved in deaerated EtOH 96wt% (44mL). This solution was thermally treated at 120°C for 15min at 250W by mono-mode microwave (80mL glass vessel). Cu2(O2CNEt2)4·2NHEt2 (130mg, 0.2mmol) was then added to this dispersion and treated again by microwave with the same reaction parameters. The product was then filtered and washed three times with EtOH 96wt% (total volume of 210mL). The solid phase was recovered using a neodymium magnet, dried under vacuum for 10h and stored under inert atmosphere. 2.2.5 Few layer graphene oxidation Few layer graphene (8g) was purified by suspending it in concentrated HCl (150mL) and stirring at room temperature for 10h. The suspension was filtered and the solid was washed with distilled water (9×40mL) until a neutral supernatant was obtained. The solid was then dried in an oven at 105°C for 40h. The graphene functionalization was achieved by suspending the purified graphene in concentrated HNO3 (150mL) and heated to reflux at 140°C for 3h. The suspension was then cooled and filtered. The solid was washed with distilled water (9×40mL) until a neutral supernatant was obtained. Lastly, it was dried in oven at 105°C for 60h. 2.2.6 CuOx[ca]/G Oxidized graphene (G) (1g) and Cu2(O2CNEt2)4·2NHEt2 (370mg, 0.5mmol) were dissolved in deaerated isopropanol (44mL) and sonicated for 2min. This dispersion was then thermally treated at 180°C for 12min at 250W by a mono-mode microwave (80mL glass vessel). The product was then filtered, washed four times with isopropanol (total volume of 280mL). Every time, the particles were recovered by centrifugation (3000rpm for 5min). Lastly, the particles were dried under vacuum for 10h and stored under inert atmosphere. 2.2.7 Fe3O4/G Oxidized graphene (1g) and Fe(OAc)2 (700mg, 4mmol) were suspended in deaerated isopropanol (44mL) and sonicated for 2min. This dispersion was then thermally treated at 180°C for 15min at 250W by mono-mode microwave (80mL glass vessel). The product was then filtered and washed four times with isopropanol (total volume of 280mL). The particles were magnetically recovered using a neodymium magnet, dried under vacuum for 10h and stored under inert atmosphere. 2.2.8 CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4/G Oxidized graphene (1g) and Fe(OAc)2 (700mg, 4mmol) were suspended in deaerated isopropanol (44mL) and sonicated for 2min. This dispersion was MW-irradiated at 180°C with the power of 250W for 15min. Cu2(O2CNEt2)4·2NHEt2 (370mg, 0.5mmol) was added and the dispersion was MW-irradiated again for 12min at 180°C and 250W. The final product was magnetically recovered, washed three times with isopropanol (total volume of 210mL), dried under vacuum for 10h and stored under inert atmosphere. 2.3 Catalytic tests Homocoupling reactions were carried out in a 45mL Parr 276AC2 T304 4744 autoclave. The reactor was equipped with magnetic stirrer and an external oil bath heating. In a typical experiment the catalyst (50mg), phenylacetylene (0.5mmol) and toluene (8mL) were loaded in stainless steel Parr reactor in air. The reactor was then plunged in the pre-heated oil bath at 180°C. The reaction mixture was stirred (1000rpm) and kept at 180°C for 3h. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature; the catalyst was separated with the neodymium magnet and washed five times with n-hexane (overall amount 20mL). The reaction mixture and the washings were combined and analyzed by GC-FID on a gas chromatograph Perkin Elmer AutosystemXL, equipped with a FID detector and a Restek Rtx-5Amines (5% biphenyl and 95% dimethylpolysiloxane) column, 30m x 0.53mm x 1μm, with naphthalene as internal standard. The TOF are given in total number of moles transformed into the desired product per moles of copper per hour. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst synthesis and characterization Several magnetic Cu-based catalytic systems were prepared following a green procedure that involves the use of microwaves and alcoholic solvent [37]. The reaction condition used and catalyst characterization are presented in Table 1 . Copper acetate or copper carbamate were used as Cu-precursors, and iron acetate as magnetite precursor. For some catalytic systems, oxidized few layer graphene (G) was used to evaluate the influence of this support on catalyst dispersion and performances. The carbon support was first oxidized with diluted nitric acid in order to obtain oxygenated sites on its surface, which should act as anchoring points for metal deposition. Isopropanol was used as a solvent for the synthesis of G supported systems for optimal dispersion of the carbon support. Magnetite was first synthetized in the absence of copper. Copper(II) acetate and iron(II) acetate were decomposed together in a “one-pot” reaction to produce CuOx[ac]/Fe3O4. This material should contain copper both inside and outside the magnetite lattice. The same synthesis was carried out with copper(II) carbamate precursor, Cu2(O2CNEt2)4·2NHEt2, leading to CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4. Copper carbamate was also decomposed on the surface of the already formed magnetite to yield CuOx[ca]@Fe3O4. On G, two reference catalysts, Fe3O4/G and CuOx[ca]/G, were synthetized. Finally, another system, CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4/G, was prepared by decomposing copper carbamate on the already formed Fe3O4/G. The catalysts were characterized by ICP-OES, BET, X-Ray diffraction, Raman and IR spectroscopy, TGA, TEM, X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy and SQUID analyses. The presence of magnetite as magnetic material was confirmed by XRD, Raman and IR data (see Fig. 1 for the CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4 system, and SI.1 for the others). All the diffraction peaks can be attributed to the cubic-phase Fe3O4 {JCPDS-019-0629}. No signals for Fe(0) or other oxides were detected, which indicates that the oxidation reaction was selective, and formed exclusively Fe3O4·The lattice parameter (8.400Å>a>8.291Å) and interplanar spacing (2.532Å>d331 >2.500Å) for the Fe3O4-containing samples are generally lower than the values reported for bulk magnetite (a=8.394Å and d311 =2.531Å), but in agreement with data reported for nano-magnetite [38]. Copper oxide was not detected by XRD for most samples, presumably because of a low Cu loading. Information about the copper oxide phase can only be found in the XRD diffractogram of the CuOx[ca]/G system (SI.1.4), probably due to its higher Cu loading and absence of magnetite, which presents peaks at similar angles. Near the graphene peaks, it is possible to observe the typical signals of face centered cubic cuprite (Cu2O, JCPDS 05-0667, a=4.269Å) at 2θ values of 29.7°, 36.2°, 42.3°, 61.3°, and 73.5°, corresponding to (110), (111), (200), (220), and (311) phases of crystalline Cu2O respectively and no obvious peaks of impurity were detected in the XRD pattern. The Cu2O phase was also the major one in the case of Cu nanoparticles produced on reduced graphene oxide [39,40]. Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 1b, and SI.1) confirms the presence of magnetite in all samples with a strong signal at 668cm−1 accompanied by other weak features around 464 and 292cm−1, which can be assigned to the Ag, T2g, and Eg vibrational modes, respectively. The Raman spectra give no reliable information about the copper phase (Fig. 1b). The characteristic signals of few layer graphene were detected by Raman for the supported catalysts (see SI.1.4, SI.1.5 and SI.1.6). The narrow G band at 1582cm−1 shows that a well crystallized sp2 carbon network is present. The D (1337cm−1) and D’ (1617cm−1) bands are relatively high, and could be the result of defects at the edges of smaller flakes; the flakes small area giving rise to a large number of edges. An intense 2D band (2661cm−1) is one of the indications of the presence of graphene. For the supported catalysts, the Raman spectra give no information about the magnetite or copper oxide, probably due to their low concentrations with respect to the carbonaceous support. Infrared spectroscopy shows the characteristic bands of magnetite at 1021, 658, and 562cm−1 (Figs. 1 c and SI.1). The characteristic band of copper oxides at around 620cm−1 could not be detected due to overlapping Fe3O4 bands. For all the samples produced, acetate species chemisorbed on the catalyst surface were detected by IR (bands at 1550 and 1419cm−1). The presence of adsorbed carbamate species on the samples prepared from copper carbamate cannot be ruled out. TGA analyses confirmed the presence of adsorbed organic species, with a significant weight loss below 230°C, which is typical of acetate species (Fig. 1d for sample CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4, and SI.2 for the others) [41]. These weight losses ranged between 15 and 35% for the unsupported catalysts and between 3 and 10% for the supported ones. Magnetite-based catalysts were also analyzed using a SQUID magnetometer that allows observations of the characteristic hysteresis loop (Fig. 1e for the CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4 system, and SI.3 for the others). The first observation is the absence of any coercivity and retentivity that are diagnostic for a superparamagnetic behavior. In fact, particles smaller than the Weiss domains are known to have this particular response, similar to paramagnetic ones [42]. The Fe3O4 sample shows a saturation magnetization (M0) of 65.6 emu/g, which is a typical value for such small nanoparticles [43]. The other systems had M0 values ranging between 40 and 67 emu/g. The highest value measured corresponding to the CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4 sample. All these catalysts present almost the same surface area, around 50–60m2/g (Table 1). The BET surface of the pristine G support is 40m2.g−1. Any difference in catalytic activity will therefore not be imputable to differences in the available contact area towards the reagents. For all Cu-based systems a theoretical Cu loading of 5% w/w was aimed (Table 1). The difference of about 1% between CuOx[ac]/Fe3O4 and CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4 can be attributed to the nature of the precursor. Copper carbamate complexes, probably due to their easier decomposition, lead to a higher Cu loading. CuOx[ca]@Fe3O4 has almost the same copper content than CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4, indicating that there is no difference in decomposing the carbamate precursor in or on the magnetite. On G support a relatively high copper loading was obtained for CuOx[ca]/G; whereas when using Fe3O4/G as support the Cu loading decreases to 1.1%, pointing to the different surface chemistry of these two materials. The nanoparticle sizes were determined by XRD and TEM (Table 1). The dimensions derived from the Scherrer equation are generally larger than those measured from the TEM micrographs. Magnetite nanoparticle size is smaller on the supported samples, pointing to the positive role of the support on metal dispersion. The size of the Cu2O nanoparticles in CuOx[ca]/G was 13nm (9nm from TEM). From the TEM observations, a narrower particle size distribution as well as a lower mean particle size was also observed for the supported catalysts (Fig. 2 for the CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4 and CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4/G samples, and SI.4 for the other samples). As the distinction between CuOx and magnetite nanoparticles was not possible from the TEM micrographs, these mean diameters correspond to both CuOx and Fe3O4 nanoparticles. In order to investigate the copper oxide nature, catalysts were analyzed by XPS (Table 2 and Fig. 3 ).The semi-quantitative data presented in Table 2 show that the unsupported samples present a high carbon concentration, which should be correlated to the presence of surface acetate species (see SI.5 for the XPS C1s spectra, C1s peak at 288.7eV). From the Cu2p3/2 XPS spectra it is possible to detect the presence of Cu(II), in particular CuO and Cu(OH)2 in about all the samples (Fig. 3a). From the data, the copper on the catalysts surface is mostly Cu(II). However, there is also a small amount of Cu(I). CuO, Cu2O and Cu have close signals Cu2p3/2 respectively at 933.2, 932.4, and 932.3eV; and CuO has a satellite around 943eV [44]. The CuOx[ca]/G sample present the highest amount of Cu(II), supported by the strong satellite, and a low amount of Cu(I). This is not in agreement with the XRD data for which the crystal phase detected was essentially Cu2O. This result points to a surface oxidation of the CuOx nanoparticles. For Cu2O nanoparticles, CuO often forms a shell around the crystalline core comprising the Cu2O phase [45,46]. CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4 and CuOx[ac]@Fe3O4 show mainly the typical signals of Cu(II) and to minor extent the presence of Cu(I). The low copper loading of CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4/G makes the data interpretation difficult. In this sample Cu(I) is the major species and Cu(II) the minor one. Reduction in the XPS instrument under X-ray illumination under an ultrahigh vacuum environment could also explain the result obtained for this sample [47]. XPS analyses confirm also the presence of magnetite (Fig. 3b) as magnetic support of CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4/G, CuOx[ac]/Fe3O4 and CuOx[ca]@Fe3O4. Typical signals for magnetite are observed at 711 and 724eV [48]. 3.2 Oxidative homocoupling of phenylacetylene The performance of the different copper based catalytic systems was evaluated for the oxidative homocoupling of phenylacetylene without any external additives (Scheme 1). The reactions were initially carried out in refluxing toluene under air. However, among the potential catalytic systems only (CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4/G) produced small amounts of 1. To optimize the reaction conditions, we investigated the effect of temperature on the reaction yield (Fig. 4 ). Only low yields of the desired product were obtained at higher temperatures with CuOx[ca]/G, a non-magnetic catalytic system, and CuOx[ac]/Fe3O4. However, nearly quantitative yields of the product were obtained at 180°C with CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4, CuOx[ca]@Fe3O4 and CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4/G (Table 3 ). Nanoparticles of magnetite (Fe3O4) and Fe3O4/G were inactive under optimized reaction conditions (180°C) in the oxidative coupling of phenylacetylene, confirming that copper oxide is the active phase. These results demonstrate that CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4, CuOx[ca]@Fe3O4 and CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4/G are effective catalytic systems in the oxidative dimerization of phenylacetylene. Additionally, copper is required to observe catalytic activity, albeit in a relatively small amount, particularly when compared to previously reported Cu-TiO2 system [30]. The different catalytic activities observed between CuOx[ac]/Fe3O4 and CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4 cannot be explained only in terms of copper loadings, BET surface, and [Fe3O4-CuOx] nanoparticle size. The nature of the precursor has a pronounced influence. Copper carbamate is easier to decompose and may lead to a higher dispersion of the CuOx active phase, due toa higher nucleation rate. The low activity of the CuOx[ca]/G catalyst may also be due to the relatively larger copper nanoparticle size measured for this sample (9nm), when compared for example to the 8nm measured for [Fe3O4-CuOx] nanoparticle in the sample CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4, which contain only 3.9% w/w of Cu, and for which we can thus suspect a much smaller CuOx nanoparticle size. CuOx nanoparticle size below 3nm have often been reported in the literature [33]. A synergistic effect between CuOx and magnetite can also be proposed. Indeed, Suib et al. have shown that for CuOx/MnOx catalysts, the MnOx support assists the reoxidation of reduced Cu species formed during the catalysis [31]. A similar role could be played in our case by the magnetite. The formation of inactive reduced copper species from copper(II) oxide/magnetite catalysts has also be reported for the coupling-allenylation-cyclization reaction, which operates at lower temperature [49]. Additionally, the involvement of residual acetate ligands adsorbed on the surface of the catalytic systems on the catalytic performances, cannot be discarded (the lower the amount of residual ligands the higher the activity is). Interestingly, the presence of graphene enhanced significantly the catalytic activity, CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4/G, displaying a TON three times greater than CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4, CuOx@Fe3O4 and other systems [30], pointing to the beneficial role of the support on metal dispersion. An electronic effect cannot be neglected, since graphene surface can promote charge transfer [50,51]. Additionally, we propose that a significant amount of phenylacetylene can be absorbed via π−π stacking on the graphene support to generate a micro-environment with higher concentration of reactant-adspecies at the surface of the functioning catalyst, thus increasing the rate of surface homocoupling reaction. Increased catalytic activity upon an increased coverage of the catalyst support surface by the reactant has already been reported for hydrogenation of aromatic ring containing substrates on carbon supports [52–55]. The simple separation of the magnetic catalytic system with a neodymium magnet from the reaction mixture facilitates its recovery. The catalytic systems were thus reused as is after being thoroughly rinsed. Oxidative homocouplings of phenylacetylene were carried out with recycled catalysts under optimal reaction conditions. The results are reported in Table 4 . The activity of the CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4/G catalyst dropped rapidly after only two runs. These results are in contrast with those obtained with CuOx[ca]@Fe3O4 and CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4. A similar behavior was noticed for the CuOx[ca]/G catalyst, for which the yield decreases from 23% for the first run to 6% for the second, and 0% for the third run. The other two catalytic systems maintained their activities even after 4 runs without any particular treatments. In order to further study the stability of the catalytic systems and understand the poor recyclability of the most active catalytic system, CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4/G, the optimized homocoupling reaction was carried out in presence of 1 equivalent of 1 (Scheme 2 , and Table 5 ). Conjugated diynes that are good electron rich ligands, can act as bridge ligands and can show chelate effect. They could adsorb strongly on the active metal or on the carbonaceous support due to their electron delocalization. CuOx[ca]@Fe3O4 and CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4 are not affected by the presence of the product as it would be expected from the recycling experiments. However, a sensible decrease in activity for CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4/G (3.8h−1) in presence of 1,4-diphenyl-1,3-dibutyne suggests poisoning of this catalyst by 1. We attribute this result to a competitive adsorption of phenylacetylene and 1 on the surface of graphene. Starting the reaction with a mixture of 1 and phenylacetylene, may result in the preferential adsorption on 1 on the surface of the support, which suppress the favorable micro-environment discusses above. Similarly, for the recycling experiments, at the end of the first run the solution contains only 1 that can adsorbed on the graphene surface. This should conduct to a situation similar to the addition of 1 to the starting mixture, since similar conversions (≈40%) were obtained. Additionally, dimerizations of phenylacetylene were performed under optimized conditions with recycled CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4 after (1–5) runs at incomplete conversion (30min). The obtained results are consistent with a slow decrease in the catalytic activity of CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4 (Table 6 ). Finally, a last experiment with fresh CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4 was performed adopting a modification of the optimized conditions. The reaction was stopped after about 20min (yield=9%) and the catalyst removed by hot filtration from the reaction mixture. The liquid phase was inserted again in the autoclave and thermally treated for the remaining reaction time: in this case the final yield was only 14%. This test indicates that the catalysis is likely due to heterogeneous species. 4 Conclusion To conclude, we have successfully synthetized several magnetic catalytic systems for the oxidative homocoupling of phenylacetylene without any additives. The TOF values obtained with the best catalysts (3–9.6h−1) are among the best reported in the literature for catalysts operating in air and in the absence of an external base [30,31]. The recovery of the nanometric size particles is easily carried out with a magnet and CuOx[ca]/Fe3O4 catalytic system can be recycled up to five times without any important loss in catalytic activity. These features make this process simple and environmentally friendly.

        "dc:description": "We successfully prepared copper-based magnetic catalysts combining copper oxide and magnetite nanoparticles. These systems are active and selective in the oxidative homocoupling reaction of phenylacetylene in the absence of an external base. These systems are particularly interesting since the addition of an external base induces copper leaching by production of soluble molecular copper-base complexes. Some of these systems were also supported on oxidized few layer graphene to investigate a potential role of this support. We discover that this supported system is three times more active than the other ones. We propose that the role of graphene support is to improve catalyst dispersion, but also to provide a favorable micro-environment around the active phase via a pre-adsorption of the substrate on the support, which affords a substrate rich micro-environment around the active particles. Recycling experiments show that the graphene-supported systems cannot be recycled, while the other ones can. This result could be explained by a competitive pre-adsorption between the substrate and the product of the reaction on the surface of the support.",
