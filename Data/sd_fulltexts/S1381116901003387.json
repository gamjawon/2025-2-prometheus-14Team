Tel.: +91-376-370121x529; fax: +91-376-370011 Newly synthesized rhodium(I) carbonyl complexes of the type [Rh(CO)2ClL] (1), where L=α,N-diphenylnitrone (a), α-styryl-N-phenylnitrone (b), N,N′-diphenyldinitrone (c) and α-(2-furyl)-N-phenylnitrone (d), act as efficient catalyst precursors (maximum turn over number (TON) 1200–1400 per 90min) for carbonylation of methanol to produce acetic acid and its ester at temperature 150±10°C and pressure 20bar. Keywords Rhodium Nitrones Catalyst Carbonylation of methanol Acetic acid 1 Introduction The chemistry of nitrones is well established with respect to its applications as catalysts as well as reagents for organic synthesis [1–4], but their transition metal chemistry is not much developed. Literature survey reveals [5–7] that only a few nitrone complexes of first row transition metals have so far been reported, where nitrones are coordinated to metal through oxygen donor. To the best of our knowledge, till today there is no report on the rhodium nitrone complex. Recently, rhodium metal complexes with different types of donor ligands have gained much attention because of their potential applications as catalysts, particularly in carbonylation reaction [8–12]. Since the first report [8], the species [Rh(CO)2I2]− is used as preferred commercial catalyst for carbonylation of methanol to acetic acid. Research activities are continued to modify the catalyst either by incorporating different types of ligands in the metal complex species [9–12] or by changing the metal center [13–15]. Recently, BP Chemicals has commercialized an iridium iodide based catalyst system (Cativa process) for carbonylation of methanol to acetic acid [14]. As a part of our work [16,17], i.e. the effects of various ligands on rhodium catalyzed carbonylation of methanol, we report in the present communication the synthesis of rhodium(I) complexes containing different types of nitrones (Fig. 1 ) and their application as catalyst precursors for carbonylation of methanol. 2 Experimental 2.1 General methods Elemental analyses were performed using Perkin-Elmer 2400 elemental analyzer and IR spectra were recorded in KBr disc on a Perkin-Elmer System 2000 FT IR spectrophotometer. The 1 H (300.13MHz) NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 solution on a Bruker DPX-300 spectrophotometer and chemical shift were reported relative to SiMe4 as an internal reference. The carbonylation reaction was carried out in a 150ml teflon-coated reactor (Laboratory High Pressure Reactor, model HR-100, Berghof, Germany) fitted with a pressure gauge and the reaction products were analyzed by GC (Chemito 8510, FID). Nitrones [18] and [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 [19] were prepared by literature methods. 2.1.1 Synthesis of complexes 1a–d [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 (0.0515mmol) was dissolved in CHCl3 (40cm3) and to this solution, a stoichiometric quantity (Rh:L=1:1) of the respective nitrone ligand (a–d) (0.108mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 2h at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere. The solution was then evaporated to dryness. The solid compound thus obtained was washed several times with petroleum ether and finally dried over CaCl2 in a desiccator. 2.1.2 Synthesis of complexes 1d′ A red colored compound was formed on storing the orange-red complex 1d in a desiccator for about 10 days. The product was thoroughly washed with hexane–petroleum ether mixture. Analytical data for the complexes are as follows: 1a: color (deep red); yield (93%); anal. calcd. for C15H11ClNO3Rh in %: C (46.03), H (2.81), N (3.58); found: C (45.93), H (2.76), N (3.49). 1b: color (reddish yellow); yield (95%); anal. calcd. for C17H13ClNO3Rh in %: C (48.92), H (3.11), N (3.35); found: C (48.76), H (3.21), N (3.44). 1c: color (reddish brown); yield (91%); anal. calcd. for C16H12ClN2O4Rh in %: C (44.23), H (2.76), N (6.46); found: C (44.34), H (2.65), N (6.57). 1d: color (orange-red); yield (90%); anal. calcd. for C13H9ClNO4Rh in %: C (40.94), H (2.36), N (3.67); found: C (40.73), H (2.45), N (3.71). 1d′: color (red); yield (80%); anal. calcd. for C12H9ClNO3Rh in %: C (40.73), H (2.54), N (3.96); found: C (40.81), H (2.57), N (3.93). 2.2 Carbonylation of methanol MeOH (3.1ml, 0.076mol), MeI (1ml, 0.006mol), H2O (1ml, 0.055mol) and the complex 1 (0.045mmol) were charged into the reactor. The reactor was purged with CO gas for about 5min and then pressurized with CO gas (6bar, 0.036mol at about 30°C). The pressure in the reactor was maintained at about 20bar by increasing the temperature to 150±10°C (reaction time 30–90min). For recycling experiment, the orange colored solution obtained after carbonylation reaction (90min run) was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure to get a dark brown solid mass. With this solid mass as catalyst the carbonylation reaction was repeated by maintaining the same experimental conditions as described above. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterization of complexes The dimeric complex [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 undergoes bridge splitting reaction with two molar equivalent (Rh:L=1:1) of nitrone ligands (a–d) to produce complexes of the type [Rh(CO)2ClL](1a–d) (L=nitrones) (Scheme 1 ). The IR spectra of the complexes 1a–d exhibit two almost equally intense terminal ν(CO) bands in the range 2000–2080cm−1 (Table 1 ) indicating cis disposition of the two carbonyl groups [20–22]. IR spectra also show a strong ν(NO) stretching band in the range 1160–1200cm−1 (Table 1), which is about 25–40cm−1 lower compared to the corresponding free ligands value indicate formation of rhodiumoxygen bond. The 1 H NMR spectra of all the complexes show (Table 1) a set of multiplates in the range δ 6.8–7.7ppm assigned to the aromatic proton and other characteristic resonances for different types of CH protons. Except 1d all the complexes are very much stable in air. It has been observed that the dicarbonyl complex 1d on storing in a desiccator for about 10 days undergoes a decarbonylation reaction resulting a monocarbonyl complex [Rh(CO)Cl{α-(2-furyl)-N-phenylnitrone}] (1d′) (Scheme 2 ) as indicated by a single terminal ν(CO) value at 2000cm−1. The ν(COC) band occurs at 1025cm−1 which is about 15cm−1 lower compared to that of the complex 1d indicating chelate formation through furyl oxygen atom. The chelation of the ligand is further substantiated by 1 H NMR spectroscopy (Table 1) where the signal due to the CH proton attached to furyl oxygen atom is shifted to downfield compared to that of the non-chelated complex 1d. In the complex 1d′ the CO is at trans to nitrone oxygen atom because high electron withdrawing nature of CO prefer a more electron donor group at its trans position [23]. 3.2 Carbonylation of methanol The results of batch carbonylation of methanol to acetic acid and its ester in presence of complexes 1a–d as catalyst precursors are shown in Table 2 . GC analysis of the product reveals that when the reaction was carried out for 30min, the precursor complex 1a–d show 48, 51, 54 and 52% conversion of methanol, respectively, with corresponding turn over number (TON) 691, 734, 777 and 748. Under the same experimental condition the well-known catalyst precursor [Rh(CO)2I2]− generated in situ from [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 [24] show only 30% conversion with a TON 430. It can be seen from Table 2 that as the reaction time increases the TON also increases. The complexes 1a–d after 90min reaction time show a maximum conversion of 83, 91, 96 and 87% respectively with corresponding TON 1195, 1310, 1382 and 1252. After completion of carbonylation reactions (90min run) the catalyst has been recovered. On recycling the catalyst for second time almost the same amount of conversion has been found (Table 2) indicating longer durability as well as stability of the catalyst. It has been observed that for a particular reaction time the complexes 1a–d show higher TON over the species [Rh(CO)2I2]−, which may be attributed to higher stability of the complexes. The higher conversion or TON shown by the complexes 1b–d over 1a may be attributed to the possible chelate formation in the complexes through O, CC(1b) or O, O(1c and 1d) donors of the ligands (Fig. 1) leading to higher stability of the intermediate complex formed during the catalytic reaction.
