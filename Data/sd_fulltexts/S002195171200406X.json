Fax: +1 501 683 7601. Graphical abstract Carbon nanotubes are grown at temperatures as low as 150°C on graphene sheets decorated with ∼5nm iron oxide nanoparticles in an argon/hydrogen environment. The decorated samples with larger nanoparticles (∼15nm) only initiate nanotube growth at 400°C or higher, indicating a strong size-dependence on the catalytic activity of these nanoparticles. These novel nanoparticle/graphene/nanotube systems can be used in a wide range of applications. Highlights ► Graphene sheets were decorated with iron oxide nanoparticles with different diameters. ► MWCNTs were grown at temperatures as low as 150°C on decorated graphene sheets. ► The growth occurred only in an argon/hydrogen environment. ► Samples decorated with larger particles did not yield nanotube formation below 400°C. ► A strong size-dependence on the catalytic activity of nanoparticles was observed. In this work, we report the growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) at temperatures as low as 150°C on an iron oxide–graphene, multicomponent, nano-structural system. A radio-frequency generator and an electrical furnace are separately used to heat the decorated graphene samples in an argon/hydrogen environment without adding any external hydrocarbon source. Few-layer graphene sheets are decorated with iron oxide nanoparticles using a simple one-step process and thoroughly characterized by electron microscopy. The synthesis temperature is varied between 150 and 500°C, and nanotube’s presence is confirmed by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. We find that, while the graphene decorated with 5nm iron oxide nanoparticles forms nanotubes at the lowest temperature (150°C), the decorated samples with larger nanoparticles (15nm) only initiate nanotube growth at 400°C or higher, indicating a strong size-dependence on the catalytic activity of these nanoparticles. This low-temperature, facile technique opens the door to a wide range of applications for these novel nanoparticle/graphene-nanotube systems in areas varying from nano-electronics and energy harvesting to bio-nano. Keywords Graphene Iron oxide catalyst Low-temperature growth Carbon nanotube Chemical vapor deposition 1 Introduction Since the discovery of CNTs, numerous efforts have been focused on finding technological approaches to lower their corresponding synthesis temperature, which could make the growth of these nanomaterials more practical for various applications especially in the nano-electronic and field emission areas [1–4]. More specifically, since complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) devices are generally fabricated at temperatures below 400°C, lowering the CNT growth temperature is imperative for their incorporation in hybrid, complex electronic devices [5]. However, the most common growth temperatures for CNTs, depending on the catalyst system and the synthesis conditions, range between 700 and 1000°C [6–9]. Compared to other synthesis techniques, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) remains the most popular method and has been widely used to synthesize CNTs at lower temperatures in controlled conditions resulting in nanomaterials with excellent morphologies and characteristics [10]. More recently, several groups have been working to synthesize CNTs at very low temperatures (below 300°C) with and without the presence of catalyst systems. Wang et al. have reported the growth of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) at 160°C by the decomposition of polyethylene glycol using a hydrothermal synthesis without the addition of catalyst Fe/Co/Ni [11]. Since this reaction requires 20h, it is time-consuming and complex. Wang et al. were able to improve the quality and yield of MWCNTs by increasing the synthesis temperature to 180°C [12]. Vohs et al. reported the lowest synthesis temperature (175°C) for MWCNTs, using CCl4 as a precursor along with metal-encapsulated dendrimers as catalysts in a 24-h treatment at 27.6MPa [13]. However, this method was reported to produce relatively low-quality nanotubes and could have limited practicality for industrial applications, since it requires high pressure and a lengthy synthesis time. Moreover, low-quality MWCNTs or nanorods were synthesized on various catalysts, such as Fe, Au, or Ag, utilizing tetrachloroethylene as the carbon feedstock; reactions were performed in the presence of benzene and potassium and kept at 200°C for 27h [14]. Vertically aligned MWCNTs have been synthesized using a photo-thermal chemical vapor deposition technique on a Ti/Fe catalyst film at temperatures as low as 370°C [5]. Others have demonstrated the growth of CNTs by CVD method on catalyst systems, such as Ni supported on zeolite and Ti/Fe on SiO2 at temperatures between 350 and 600°C using methane [15]. Additionally, Sharma et al. have reported in situ observations of nanotube growth at 450°C over Ni or Co catalysts [10]. New nanomaterials composed of 1- and 2-dimensional carbon structures with improved electronic and mechanical properties have been prepared by growing nanotubes or nanowires on graphite or graphite-derived products coated with various catalytic nanoparticles, such as Co and Ni [16,17]. These reactions were found to take place at high temperatures (900–1000°C) with or without the addition of hydrocarbons. Furthermore, pristine MWCNTs were grown on amorphous carbon after a hydrothermal treatment at 800°C [18]. Amorphous carbon or graphite coated with nano-diamonds has been used to grow nanotubes at 850°C during the pyrolysis of ethanol [19]. Recently, we were able to lower the CNT synthesis temperature using an Au catalyst deposited on graphene sheets. We demonstrated the catalytic conversion of Au-decorated graphene into CNTs without the addition of a hydrocarbon source at temperatures as low as 500°C [20]. Taken alone, both graphene and inorganic nanoparticles have the potential to impact a plethora of complex technical applications. A major advantage in the use of graphene is its high surface area, which allows increased interactions with other materials, especially when metal oxide nanoparticles can be decorated on the graphene surface. In order to take advantage of the chemistry of these composite materials, several routes have been employed for composite preparations, including microwave heating [21] and hydrothermal treatment in an autoclave [22]. Xue et al. [23] demonstrated a novel method that utilized the oxidizing nature of graphene oxide to form monodispersed magnetite from iron ions and concomitant reduction of the oxygen functionalities on the graphene surface. On the other hand, the many unique electrical, magnetic, and mechanical properties of iron oxide-based carbon composites make them well-suited for use as actuators [24] and batteries/supercapacitors [25,26]. Several researchers have demonstrated that iron oxide (i.e., magnetite) composites can be utilized for removal of environmental pollutants with specific examples cited for heavy metals such as Co [27], Cr [28], and As [29]. In one instance, the magnetite–graphene was utilized to grow layered double-hydroxides of Mg and Al in order to remove arsenate more effectively [30]. Along with these materials’ ability to remove heavy metals from the environment, they are also useful for pesticide remediation [31,32]. The controlled release of drugs bound to the surface of magnetite nano-composites [25], magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques [33], and H2O2 biosensors [34] are other potential uses of these multifunctional materials. Furthermore, being able to control certain parameters such as the size and ratio of nanoparticle-to-graphene [35,36] and incorporating CNTs into these composites affords the possibility for widespread applications to be realized [37]. In this work, we report the growth of MWCNTs on iron oxide-decorated graphene sheets at temperatures as low as 150°C (±5°C), without addition of any hydrocarbon source. To the best of our knowledge, this is the lowest temperature reported to date for nanotube synthesis on metal-decorated graphene. Developing an efficient low-temperature growth method for high-purity crystalline CNTs and selecting the right substrate are crucial for their integration in novel devices [5]. Similar synthesis reactions were repeated for the graphene decorated with the ∼15nm iron oxide nanoparticles, which resulted in CNT formation only at 400°C or higher. These findings highlight the complex nature of the catalytic activity of nano-structural materials as a function of their size and their morphological properties. Additionally, the radio-frequency chemical vapor deposition (RF-CVD) utilized in this work is a straightforward and rapid technique for low-temperature growth of nanotubes. Using only an argon/hydrogen mixture (no hydrocarbons or other gases) makes this method very inexpensive and convenient for large-scale applications. Another advantage of this approach is the facile one-step process to decorate graphene with iron oxide nanoparticles, which could be utilized in other applications. Other reports have presented rather complex methods involving several steps and various chemical agents to link nanoparticles to graphene [38,39]. In the present study, CNT growth was demonstrated at temperatures between 150 and 500°C using two different heating methods (RF generator and electrical furnace). 2 Experimental section High-purity crystalline graphene was purchased from Ångstron Materials, Inc., and thoroughly characterized by electron microscopy and thermal–gravimetrical analysis as previously shown [20]. Microscopic analysis revealed the presence of few-layer graphene sheets with average dimensions of several microns. Next, graphene was functionalized with carboxylic groups through a treatment in sulfuric and nitric acid (3:1 ratio) and stirred overnight [20]. Finally, the solution was filtered and continuously washed with DI water until the pH was neutral; it was then dried overnight in an oven at 80°C. The functionalized graphene powder was homogenously dispersed in DI water (∼1mg/ml) using a tip-sonicator for 30min. Carboxylated iron oxide nanoparticles with two different diameters (∼5 or ∼15nm) were purchased from Ocean Nanotech, LLC, and separately added to the graphene solution (1:1 ratio) through sonication for 3h. Next, the mixture was filtered and dried overnight at 100°C, and the final iron oxide–graphene powder was characterized by electron microscopy. Synthesis reactions were carried out using a RF generator with a frequency of 350kHz. For each RF-CVD reaction, approximately 10mg of the iron oxide–graphene mixture was spread on a graphite boat and placed inside a quartz tube positioned at the center of the generator coil. The RF generator was turned on after the sample was first flushed with argon at 150ml/min for 10min. Once the iron oxide–graphene was heated to the target temperature, hydrogen was added at 100ml/min for 30min. Subsequently, hydrogen and the generator were turned off, and the sample was cooled to room temperature under argon flow for 10min. To further explore the nanotube growth at low temperatures, similar reactions were also performed using an electrical furnace. For graphene-decorated systems with ∼5nm or ∼15nm iron oxide nanoparticles, the synthesis temperature was varied between 150–500°C and 300–500°C, respectively. Control experiments were done under similar conditions using the non-decorated graphene. 3 Results and discussion The iron oxide-decorated graphene sheets were thoroughly characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscope (SEM/TEM). Fig. 1 a and its inset provide SEM images of the decorated graphene (white arrows point to the iron oxide nanoparticles on the graphene surface). Low- and high-resolution mappings performed using SEM and TEM clearly indicate the presence of Fe, C, and O. Additionally, the Fe–K X-ray signals are present in the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of the decorated graphene sheets as shown in Fig. 1b and g. TEM images of the decorated graphene sheets demonstrating a homogeneous diameter distribution of iron oxide nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 1f. The diameter of the nanoparticles deposited on the graphene sheets was found to be ∼4.5nm (±0.5nm). The inset in Fig. 1f shows the electron diffraction pattern of the graphene indicating a well-crystallized sample. CNTs were synthesized on graphene surfaces at temperatures as low as 150°C (±5°C) in the RF generator, using only argon/hydrogen mixture without adding a hydrocarbon source. Low- and high-resolution TEM images of the MWCNTs synthesized on the iron oxide-decorated graphene sheets are shown in Fig. 2 a and b. The outer and inner diameters of the tubes were found to vary between 16–20nm and 3–6nm, respectively. These values are comparable to the ones reported by Vohs et al., who synthesized nanotubes by the decomposition of CCl4 at very low temperatures [13]. Fig. 2a shows a MWCNT with diameter of 16.6nm grown on the decorated graphene sheet. A few of the iron oxide nanoparticles were found to be entrapped within the graphene layers. This observation could indicate that the nanoparticles were catalytically active but failed to produce nanotubes. Moreover, it may suggest that the nanotube growth process evolves first by the generation of graphitic layers around the metal nanoclusters, which ultimately may develop into tubular shapes. We also observed that the surface of some CNTs were decorated with iron oxide nanoparticles (arrow in Fig. 2b indicates the nanoparticle). Additionally, a few bends and ripples were detected along the nanotube walls (indicated by arrows in Fig. 2a) similar to those observed by Shang et al., when synthesizing vertically aligned CNTs at 370°C [5]. These structural defects and the low-level graphitization may be due to the stress on the walls occurring at low synthesis temperatures; studies have shown that such defects may be removed by annealing CNTs at higher temperatures, resulting in straighter tubes with higher crystallinity [5,40]. (The inset in Fig. 2b shows an image taken with the infrared camera indicating the sample temperature (155°C)) Additional reactions were also performed by using a thermo-electric tube furnace (under the same conditions as in RF-CVD) to confirm nanotube formation by two different heating methods (inductive and resistive thermal heating). TEM images of the MWCNTs grown at 150°C on the decorated graphene sheets are shown in Fig. 2c and d. Using the electrical furnace, similar CNT growth was observed at 200°C as shown in Fig. 3 a and b. High-yield CNTs were synthesized on the decorated graphene sheets at 200°C using the RF-CVD under identical conditions. A temperature increase of 50°C resulted in significantly higher CNT formation. Fig. 3c and d (and their insets) present SEM images at different magnifications of the nanotube bundles. The high- and low-resolution TEM images of the MWCNTs observed on the graphene sheet after RF treatment at 200°C are shown in Fig. 3e and f. A high percentage of nanotubes was found to have an approximate 7nm (±0.5nm) outer diameter and an inner diameter of 3–4nm, which are smaller than the outer and inner diameters of the nanotubes synthesized by others at low temperatures [10]. Nevertheless, the remaining close-ended nanotubes have diameters ranging from 10 to 15nm as revealed by TEM analysis (Fig. 3f). The reaction temperature was further increased to 300°C and the growth of tubular structures is presented in Fig. 4 a and b. A few of the TEM images (Fig. 4b) indicated the presence of large catalyst nanoparticles (with diameters between 8 and 12nm), which could be due to a coalescence of the smaller particles (∼5nm diameter) when subjected to higher temperatures (∼300°C) under the hydrogen flow. We have previously seen that during CNT growth an increase in the hydrogen level yielded larger metallic nanoparticles, as they agglomerated on the catalyst support resulting in nanotubes with larger diameters [41]. The diameter of MWCNTs was found to be approximately 20nm (±2nm). As the temperature was increased to 500°C, a higher growth of tubular structures was observed as shown in the SEM images (Fig. 4c and d). TEM observations primarily indicated the presence of highly crystalline MWCNTs with 20nm outer diameters and approximately 8.5nm inner diameters. Fig. 4e–g demonstrate the high- and low-resolution TEM images of the uniform MWCNTs synthesized at 500°C on the decorated graphene sheets. Furthermore, microscopic analyses revealed that the yield of CNTs increased as the temperature increased from 150 to 500°C, which has also been observed by others [12]. An important observation is that the graphene sheets (controls) that were not decorated with iron oxide nanoparticles did not produce any tubular structures, indicating the significance of the highly active Fe catalyst to initiate CNT growth at such low temperatures. (The TEM and SEM images of the control graphenes are shown in the Supplementary materials.) It seems that, even at a very low synthesis temperature (below 300°C), the catalyst nanoparticles in intimate contact with graphene sheets are highly reactive initiating the conversion of graphene into nanotubes [20]. Mora et al. reported that low-temperature nanotube growth is limited by a number of factors: catalytic decomposition of the carbon source, which depends on the type and size of the catalyst nanoparticle; residual oxygen present on the catalyst nanoparticles; the lowest temperature sufficient to decompose the feedstock; and the activity of the carbon source [40]. In order to further understand the influence of the nanoparticles’ size on their catalytic role, the functionalized graphene sheets were decorated with iron oxide nanoparticles with a diameter of ∼15nm and exposed to similar experimental heating conditions under argon/hydrogen environments at 300°C, 400°C, and 500°C. After a thorough TEM analysis, no CNT growth was detected at 300°C. The homogenously dispersed nanoparticles were mostly found between the graphene sheets. Fig. 5 a and its inset show the high- and low-resolution TEM images of the spherical nanoparticles nicely decorating the graphene sheets. (Additional representative TEM images of the ∼15nm iron oxide nanoparticles resting in between the graphene layers after the RF treatment at 300°C are shown in the Supplementary materials.) Next, as the temperature was increased to 400°C, we noticed a change in the morphological properties of the nanoparticles. Fig. 5b and its insets show TEM images of the graphene-decorated samples after the RF treatment at 400°C for 30min. The TEM analysis indicated the presence of a mixture of spherical (illustrated by black arrows in Fig. 5b) and non-spherical iron oxide nanoparticles with diameters of ∼15nm (formation of edges is shown by white arrows) often covered by the graphene layers. Unlike the results obtained at lower temperatures (below 400°C), the TEM images shown in Fig. 5c–e demonstrate the formation of non-crystalline MWCNTs at 400°C, with outer diameters between 9 and 11nm. The morphological properties of the ∼15nm iron oxide nanoparticles were further affected after a heat treatment at 500°C. Fig. 5f and g and their insets show representative TEM images of the decorated graphene samples RF-treated at 500°C. A thorough TEM analysis demonstrated the presence of non-spherical nanoparticles with more edges (∼6 edges) and square-like shapes (inset in Fig. 5g), rather than the spherical ones which were observed at lower temperatures (below 400°C). A few non-crystalline, short MWCNTs along with graphene-covered nanoparticles were also found. The inset in Fig. 5g shows what seems to be the start of a tubular formation from a square-shaped nanoparticle. Some of the nanoparticles were found to have soft edges at 400°C and 500°C, as shown in the insets of Fig. 5b and f, respectively. The formation of a very thin, disordered layer (few nm) has also been observed by Behrens et al. over Cu nanoparticles in a high-performance CuZn catalyst, using aberration-corrected high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis [42]. Furthermore, they concluded that undistorted pure Cu was quite inactive, while only a small fraction of the catalyst surface actually contributed to the catalyst activity [42]. Therefore, similar active sites, which could be present in the non-spherical iron oxide nanoparticles decorating the graphene sheets, may enable and enhance their catalytic activity. (Additional TEM images of the decorated graphene samples after they were heated at 400°C and 500°C in the RF generator are shown in the Supplementary materials.) The spherical and undistorted ∼15nm iron oxide nanoparticles present on graphene sheets at 300°C did not yield any nanotube formation, whereas, at higher temperatures (400°C or higher), changes in the nanoparticles’ morphology possibly led to the formation of active sites and the beginning of CNT growth. On the other hand, for the graphene sheets decorated with the ∼5nm nanoparticles, nanotube growth (even though at a low yield) was detected at temperatures as low as 150°C. We believe that this phenomenon occurs partly due to the fact that nanoparticles of the same type with various dimensions are catalytically active at different temperatures. Furthermore, experiments that we performed under identical reaction conditions with other catalyst nanoparticles, such as Au, amine-functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles, and Fe/Co mixture, separately deposited on graphene, did not yield any CNT growth at such low temperatures. We have also observed that the surface chemistry of the iron oxide nanoparticles plays a very important role. For example, amine-functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles with a diameter of ∼25nm did not show any evidence of CNT growth at temperatures lower than 400°C. Furthermore, higher temperatures (above 450°C) were required for the generation of any tubular structures on the Au-graphene and Fe/Co-graphene samples. (A detailed explanation of the preparation of the Au-graphene and Fe/Co-graphene composites and their microscopy analyses are provided in the Supplementary materials.) The diameter and/or the type of functional groups present on the nanoparticles may be some of the factors allowing catalyst reduction under hydrogen, by improving the accessibility of hydrogen molecules to the internal oxide layer, and thereby enabling the CNT formation at temperatures as low as 150°C [40]. Ziebro et al. reported that at lower temperatures carbon nanostructures, such as MWCNTs and carbon nano-fibers, grow on smaller catalyst nanoparticles compared to high-temperature reactions [15]. Therefore, the mono-metallic iron oxide catalyst (with ∼5nm diameter particles) deposited on the graphene sheets plays a crucial catalytic role in the CNT formation. These catalytic responses are yet to be fully understood. We believe that a possible combination of effects or processes could be responsible for these findings. The most important consideration is the catalytic activity of the metallic nanoparticles and the role that their size plays. Other factors include the oxidation state of the metal surface and the fact that the reduction process is possibly related to the size and the oxidation level of the nanoparticles. Hydrogen is often used to reduce various catalyst systems prior to CNT growth as it has a strong effect on the catalyst’s efficiency and the morphological properties of the resulting nanotubes. We have previously used a mixture of hydrogen and methane gases to synthesize single-walled carbon nanotubes on the Fe–Mo/MgO catalyst system under RF heating [41]. We observed that an increase in the hydrogen level induces an increase in the synthesis yield and catalyst efficiency. During the reduction process, hydrogen has a strong effect on the morphological properties of the catalyst (Fe/Mo) nanoparticles resulting in a faster reduction to a metallic state [41]. Generally, it has been observed that many of the catalyst systems require high-temperature reduction before initiating CNT growth [40,41]; however, the Fe-based catalyst system used in this work did not seem to necessitate such conditions. It has been shown that reducing the iron oxide nanoparticles is rather difficult due to the fact that, once hydrogen reaches the surface of the oxide, it initiates a fast nucleation and at the same time it forms a thin, dense layer of metal [43]. The latter was found to decrease the active interface area and slow the reduction process [43]. Pineau et al. have reported that the hydrogen reduction of hematite with grain size of about 1–2μm at temperatures under 570°C occurs in two steps: (a) Fe2O3 →Fe3O4 and (b) Fe3O4 →Fe [43,44]. It has also been reported that different gas mixtures present in the reduction process yield various values of activation energy (Ea ) [44]. Taking into consideration the same conditions used in our experimental setup (∼67% hydrogen, in a hydrogen/argon environment), values of Ea for a temperature range of 290–480°C were reported to be 124kJ/mol for the hydrogen reduction of Fe2O3 into Fe3O4 and 172kJ/mol for the reduction of Fe3O4 into Fe [43–45]. Although it was very difficult to evaluate and thoroughly prove the reduction of the ∼5nm iron oxide nanoparticles deposited on the graphene sheets at such low temperatures, the fact that CNT growth takes place under two different heating methods makes us believe that a reduction or partial reduction of the nanoparticles occurred. For various iron oxide species, the activation energy at temperatures lower than 250°C increases significantly (higher than 200kJ/mol depending on the percentage of hydrogen in the reduction environment) [44,46]. Therefore, in our iron oxide–graphene system, graphene may influence the process and the kinetics by which the metal oxide nanoparticles are reduced, thereby resulting in a lower temperature reduction and a higher catalytic activation required for CNT formation [20]. Other groups have reported that, while the hydrogen migration (or hopping) on the surface of carbon-based materials is energetically difficult, in the presence of a catalyst, this process becomes kinetically favorable [47–50]. It is believed that a catalyst is necessary in assisting the transport of hydrogen over the graphene surface, conferring a catalytic and thermodynamic effect and hence lowering its migration barrier [47,50]. It is possible that graphene plays a double role—acting as a catalyst support and as a carbon source—as previously observed for the Au-graphene system [20]. Identical reactions were also conducted inside the furnace of a thermogravimetrical instrument under argon-only environment at 150°C, and no CNTs were detected by TEM. This significant finding indicates that, in this case, hydrogen is necessary for the catalyst reduction and hence CNT growth at low temperatures. We also believe that iron oxide nanoparticles preferentially attach to the side of structural defects in the graphene layers; therefore, the missing structural C–C bonds may also explain the lower temperature required for the conversion of the 2D graphene structure into the 1D nano-tubular morphology [51]. A thorough study is ongoing to further understand the effects of graphene and the type/size of the catalyst nanoparticle on the nucleation and growth of CNTs under these particular reaction conditions. This is a facile, economical/low cost, and easily scalable technique in which only argon and hydrogen gases are employed (no hydrocarbon source) at very low temperatures. Using graphene as the only support and no other substrates (such as MgO, silica zeolite, or CaCO3) makes this nanotube growth method very practical. The latter eliminates the need of using various acid treatments for the removal of catalytic supports, which often cause numerous defects in the resulting carbon structures [6,7,9,15,20]. Additionally, the preparation of such complex catalyst systems is very time-consuming. 4 Conclusions We have reported the synthesis of MWCNTs at temperatures as low as 150°C (±5°C) on few-layer graphene sheets decorated with ∼5nm iron oxide nanoparticles under argon/hydrogen environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the lowest temperature reported to date for the growth of CNTs on graphene sheets without addition of any hydrocarbons. Microscopic analysis indicated that the nanotube deposition after the RF treatment was much higher as the synthesis temperature was increased from 150 to 500°C. CNT growth was also observed by TEM when reactions were carried out in an electrical furnace at 150°C. The graphene sheets decorated with ∼15nm catalyst particles did not yield any nanotube formation at temperatures below 400°C. This low-temperature growth technique provides a significant and promising approach for the integration of such novel nano-composites (CNT/graphene/metal) in a wide range of promising applications, varying from photovoltaic devices to sensing and drug delivery.

        "dc:description": "In this work, we report the growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) at temperatures as low as 150°C on an iron oxide–graphene, multicomponent, nano-structural system. A radio-frequency generator and an electrical furnace are separately used to heat the decorated graphene samples in an argon/hydrogen environment without adding any external hydrocarbon source. Few-layer graphene sheets are decorated with iron oxide nanoparticles using a simple one-step process and thoroughly characterized by electron microscopy. The synthesis temperature is varied between 150 and 500°C, and nanotube’s presence is confirmed by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. We find that, while the graphene decorated with 5nm iron oxide nanoparticles forms nanotubes at the lowest temperature (150°C), the decorated samples with larger nanoparticles (15nm) only initiate nanotube growth at 400°C or higher, indicating a strong size-dependence on the catalytic activity of these nanoparticles. This low-temperature, facile technique opens the door to a wide range of applications for these novel nanoparticle/graphene-nanotube systems in areas varying from nano-electronics and energy harvesting to bio-nano.",
