A series of Fe-doped alumino-borate catalysts (18 % Fe-PKU-1) with a range of crystalline qualities has been obtained by varying synthesis conditions. Based on Angle-resolved X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, pyridine adsorption infrared spectroscopy, and potentiometric titration, crystalline quality is correlated as volcano trends with the surface composition and electronic structure of Fe-PKU-1, especially for the boron species. Through the systematic change of synthesized conditions, the catalyst with the appropriate crystalline quality shows the highest surface compositions of boron and oxygen vacancies. This leads to strong surface Lewis acidity and results in the high catalytic performance of glycerin ketalization, 97 % conversion and 99 % selectivity in DL-1,2-Isopropylideneglycerol (Solketal).

The degree of crystalline quality of catalysts is also involved to optimize the catalytic reactivity [4,5]. In electro- or photo-catalysis, this physic-chemical property can modulate the defect content thus accelerating the transmission of charge carriers, leading to high efficiency [6,7]. In the case of thermo-catalysis, it was suggested to control the reaction process by tuning the adsorption of reactants and the desorption of products via improving morphology or active sites [8,9]. The nature of the reaction interface, such as chemical composition and electronic structure, was also suggested to be closely correlated to the catalytic performance [10–12]. Currently, acid catalysis is developing as a key technology to allow the transition from fossil-based chemistry to renewable-based chemistry [13]. In comparison to Brønsted acid types of catalysts, Lewis acid types of catalysts that possess stronger acid centers are more efficient to activate highly polar and oxygen-rich renewable feedstocks [14]. Classically, typical strong Lewis acids are soluble salts consisting of small highly charged cations cooperated with very weakly basic ligands, such as SbF5 [15], SnCl4 [16], FeCl3 [17], and Ga(OTF)3 [18]. However, their solubility makes difficulties in the separation of the final product from reaction mixtures and the recycling of active metals or ligands. This raises considerably high economic and environmental pressures. Therefore, the development of solids with strong Lewis acidity is of technological importance in areas as diverse as eco-chemical engineering and heterogeneous catalysis. These years, nonmetal-promoted catalysts have received growing interest due to their low cost, low toxicity, availability, and tunable surface reactivity [19–22]. Boron is located at the apex of the line separating metals and nonmetals, which has the potential to exhibit special surface reactivity by bonding with metal elements [23,24]. However, many studies reported that the boron atom behaved as a spectator rather than participating in the catalysis [25]. Recently, more and more studies have shown that the boron element plays a critical role in various reactions, such as propane dehydrogenation and the ring-opening processes of epoxides [26–28]. The electronic structure of boron can also be modified by incorporating other metal or nonmetal elements to produce special surface reactivity for specific reactions [29]. A special alumino-borate, named PKU-1, was discovered and successfully synthesized in our past studies. PKU-1 is composed of [AlO6] octahedra and borate fragments (BO(OH)2, BO2(OH), and B2O4(OH)), which are bridged with each other by sharing vertex oxygen atoms [30,31]. PKU-1 possesses high thermal stability, substantial specific acidic sites, and excellent tolerance of high-concentration doping with Cr, Fe, or Ga in its lattice [32–34]. These special features make M-PKU-1 (M = doping metal) have high potential in the application of selective oxidation and acid-base catalyzed reactions [35]. It was reported that the acid concentration and temperature in the hydrothermal process could significantly influence the final state of solid catalysts [36–38]. Specifically, the concentration of HNO3 may modulate the ionic solubility and mobility, and the synthesis temperature could affect the kinetics of crystal growth [39,40]. Fe-PKU-1 was discovered to exhibit a pronounced catalytic performance in the Glycerol (Gly) Ketalization and ring-opening hydration of epoxides [41,42]. Therefore, we utilized Fe-PKU-1 as a model catalyst to investigate if its crystalline quality could be affected by the HNO3 concentration and the synthesis temperature. Fundamental understanding of how the crystalline quality of Fe-PKU-1 influenced the surface properties and catalytic reactivity in the Gly ketalization reaction was also investigated. Our XRD analysis showed a systematic change in this property of Fe-PKU-1 as a function of HNO3 concentration and the synthesis temperature. This change appeared to affect the surface composition, electronic structure, and the acid-base properties of the catalyst, which allowed control of the catalytic activity in the Gly ketalization reaction. These findings were evidenced by the performance study, potentiometric titrations, and Angle-resolved X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (AR-XPS) analyses. 2 Methods and materials 2.1 Chemicals All chemicals were analytical grade and used as received without any purification. Ferric nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3•9H2O) was purchased from Adamas, Switzerland. Boric acid (H3BO3), 5-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane (Dioxane), and DL-1,2-Isopropylideneglycerol (Solketal, C6H12O3) were purchased from Macklin, China. Aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3•9H2O) and concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) were purchased from Chron Chemicals, China. Deionized (DI) water (18.2 MΩ cm) produced by Milli-Q water purification system (Antesheng, China) was used in this system. 2.2 Catalyst synthesis About 0.32 mmol (0.131 mg), Fe(NO3)3•9 H2O, 1.30 mmol (0.485 mg), Al(NO3)3•9H2O and 200 μl concentrated HNO3 were charged into a 50 mL Teflon stainless steel autoclave and pre-reacted at 353 K for 1 h. After the container was cooled, 49 mmol (3.0 g) H3BO3 was added into this autoclave, which was sealed again and reacted at 513 K for 72 h. After the reaction is completed, the product mixture was washed with DI water several times to remove impurities. Finally, 18 % Fe-doped PKU-1 was dried at 353 K for 4 h and collected for further reaction tests and characterization. The synthesis of 18 % Fe-PKU-1 catalysts with different crystalline qualities was prepared by controlling the acidity and reaction temperature of the synthesis environment. The crystalline quality of 18 % Fe-PKU-1 was altered by changing the synthesized temperature and the acidity in its synthesized process. The temperatures were chosen as 503 K, 513 K, and 523 K required for crystallization temperature and experimental safety. At 513 K, the pure phase of 18 % Fe-PKU-1 can be persisted by changing the acid concentration in the range of 1.49·10 −6 mol/L to 1.79·10 −6 mol/L. Thus, the HNO3 concentration of 1.49·10 −6 mol/L, 1.60·10 −6 mol/L, and 1.79·10 −6 mol/L for HNO3 are selected to study the effect of synthesis acidity on the crystalline quality. 2.3 Catalyst characterizations The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were carried out on a diffractometer (Rigaku, Smart Lab, Japan). The working voltage and current of the Cu-Ka radiation source are 40 kv and 200 mA, respectively. The scanning speed is 2 deg/min. Le Bail and Rietveld refinements were performed using the TOPAS software packages [43]. The relative crystalline qualities of these samples on the basis of the sum of the peak areas (2Ɵ = 8.0 ± 0.1, 13.3 ± 0.1, 13.8 ± 0.1, 15.5 ± 0.1, 15.9 ± 0.1, and 17.5 ± 0.1) [44–46]. The Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were examined by a Mira3 LMU SEM (Tescan, Czech Republic). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies, and energy-dispersive spectra (EDS) were carried out using a Talos F200S G2 Microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The samples were loaded onto a carbon-coated copper grid (230 mesh). Nitrogen sorption experiments were performed by a Quantachrome Autosorb-1–1 C automated adsorption system. The material was degassed at 473 K for 12 h (ramp rate 10 K/min) under helium prior to the measurement. The total number and strength of acidic sites over catalysts were recorded on a potentiometric titrator (Metrohm, 904/906 Titrando, Switzerland). The solid acid acetonitrile solution was titrated with n-butylamine solution as the base titrant, and the acid concentration of the catalyst was calculated according to the equivalence point determined by the first-order sudden change. Typically, 50 mg of 18 % Fe-PKU-1 catalysts with different crystalline qualities are placed in 50 mL of acetonitrile solution and fully stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The suspension was then titrated with a newly prepared 0.1 mmol/L n-butylamine acetonitrile solution until a constant potential was reached. The AR-XPS measurements were conducted using a ULVAC-PHI PHI5000 Versaprobe III system with a monochromatic aluminum source (Al Kα of 1486.6 eV) operating voltage at 15 kV. Survey scans in the analytical chamber were performed using a passing-energy of 69 eV and a vacuum of 8 × 10−8 Pa. Electron binding energies were calibrated against C 1 s emission at E b= 284.60 eV to correct the contact potential differences between the sample and the spectrometer. The samples were analyzed over a series of different tilt angles. The initial area of analysis was set to 700 µm by 300 µm at a take-off angle of 0°. The XPS data, such as peak intensities, were analyzed using the XPS peak fit software. The relative sensitivity factors for the relevant species were also obtained through this software package. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were collected with a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer in the mid-infrared light in the region of 4000–400 cm−1 with a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1. About 25 mg catalyst was pelletized into a wafer without KBr dilution, and then put into a self-made sample cell for degassing process at 573 K for 6 h. When cooling down to room temperature, pyridine was dosed into this cell for 2 h. The sample underwent a vacuum treatment at 423 K for 4 h, and was sealed for the subsequent measurement. The quantitative calculation for different acid centers is based on integrated Lambert–Beer Law [47] as follows: C sw = A × S m × ε where C sw (μmol/g) is the concentration of Brønsted or Lewis acid centers in reference to a unit weight of the catalyst, A (cm−1) is the integrated absorbance, S (cm2) is the cross-sectional area of the catalyst wafer, m (g) is the weight of the dried catalyst, and ε is the integrated molar extinction coefficient. According to the literature reported [48], for Brønsted acid sites, εB = 0.059 ± 0.004 (cm/μmol); for Lewis acid sites, εL = 0.084 ± 0.003 (cm/μmol). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals were recorded at room temperature with a Bruker ESR A300 spectrometer. All EPR spectra were obtained with a single scan. Typical EPR settings were as follows: microwave power, 5 mW; time constant, 0.1 s; sweep time, 4 min; magnetic field modulation, 0.16 mT; and sweep width, 10 mT. All measurements were performed at ambient temperature. The water contact angle (WAC) was recorded with JWY-200, and contact angle analysis was performed using deionized (DI) water. The measurement was performed by dropping distilled water onto the surface of the sample. The angle between the water droplet and the sample can be recorded if the droplet was stabilized. 2.4 Catalyst evaluation Glycerin (99.9 %) and acetone (99.9 %) were purchased from Aladdin. They were used directly without any purification. Glycerol ketalization was carried out in a round-bottomed flask equipped with a serpentine condenser. Typically, the 18 % Fe-PKU-1 catalyst (0.18 mmol, 50 mg) with different crystalline quality was added to a 50 mL flask which contained glycerol (10.9 mmol, 1.0 g) and acetone (86.2 mmol, 5.0 g). Then the reaction mixture was stirred at a constant temperature of 318 K for 3 h, and then filtered with a syringe with a filter membrane to remove the solid catalyst. After that, the material was transferred into a sample bottle and stored for further testing. Then, a quantitative analysis of the reaction products was performed with a GC (TECHCOMP, GC7900) equipped with a DB-35 capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 µm) and a flame ionization detector (FID). For the test, column temperature was raised from 323 K to 473 K in 5 min, then followed by another heating process to 553 K at a rate of 35 K/min. The qualitative analysis of the reaction products was implemented by an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph equipped with a capillary column (HP-5, MS: 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm) and a mass spectrometry system (Agilent 5977B). The results of mass spectrometry were shown in Fig. S9. Because the Gly ketalization is conducted in the presence of catalysts with acid nature [49], TOF values are calculated by the expression [converted substrate]/{[mole of acidic sites in catalyst] × time} and according to the reaction data at 3 h (h−1). The leaching effect of Iron(III) ions from Fe-PKU-1 has been performed as follows. 50.0 mg of Fe-PKU-③ powder was charged into 0.086 mol acetone (or 0.011 mol of glycerol), and reacted for 3 h (at 318 K). 0.011 mol glycerol (or 0.086 mol of acetone) was added into this liquid that the catalyst was removed, and then this mixture was stirred at 318 K for another 3 h. According to the above reaction conditions, the reusability of 18 % Fe-PKU-1 catalysts with the appropriate crystalline quality was also tested. After each catalytic operation, the reaction mixture was centrifuged to separate the solid catalyst. The catalyst was washed with ethanol and acetone and centrifuged again, and then dried in an oven at 353 K for the next reaction. The glycerol conversion and Solketal selectivity are obtained based on the following equations: Conversion of glycerol ( % ) = mol of glycerol converted initial mol of glycerol × 100 Selectivity towards Solketal ( % ) = mol of Solketal formed mol of glycerol converted × 100 Where the moles of glycerol converted are the sum of the moles of all the formed products. 3 Results and discussions XRD measurements were performed over a series of 18 % Fe-PKU-1 catalysts to understand the influence of synthesis temperature and acid concentration on their crystalline qualities and bulk crystal structures ( Fig. 1). Our results showed that the overall bulk crystal structure of Fe-PKU-1 did not change despite the different synthesis conditions (see Fig. 1a). The results of Le Bail fitting and Rietveld refinements were shown in Fig. S1.1–1.6 and Fig. S2.1–2.6. In contrast, the crystalline nature of 18 % Fe-PKU-1 catalysts was clearly altered by the synthesis conditions, which was evidenced by the variation in XRD peak intensities of their (110) and (300) Bragg reflections (Fig. 1b), the relative crystalline qualities, and the crystal sizes (Fig. 1c). When the acid concentration was kept at 1.64·10−6 mol/L in the synthesis, the material showed the lowest crystalline quality at 503 K than the other two samples synthesized at 513 K and 523 K (Fig. 1b). The crystalline quality appeared to rise linearly as the temperature increased. With respect to the influence of acid, our results showed that the crystalline quality of Fe-PKU-1 was improved when we increased the concentration of acid (from 1.49·10−6 mol/L to 1.79·10−6 mol/L) while keeping the temperature at 513 K. Their surface areas were systematically changed with the variations over the acid concentration (Fig. S3). These results suggested that both the elevated synthesis temperature and the enhanced acid concentration could promote the crystalline quality of the Fe-PKU-1 catalysts. The facets with lower surface energy appeared to grow faster than the ones with higher surface energies as the temperature increased, which contributed more to the final crystallinity [50]. A higher acid concentration may promote the formation of free metal ions by regulating the viscosity of the reactant mixture and improving the solubility and mobility of ions. A similar phenomenon was reported by Liu and co-workers where they found that the H+ on reactants dissociation could lead to the uncontrollability of Y3+ concentration and ultimately resulted in less nucleation for materials, which modified the formation of the YBO3 microstructure [51]. Further, the crystalline qualities of these samples were compared based on the calculated results (in Fig. 1c). Thus, these samples were denoted as Fe-PKU-①, Fe-PKU-②, Fe-PKU-③, Fe-PKU-④, Fe-PKU-⑤, and Fe-PKU-⑥ for convince, in the order from the lowest to the highest in their crystalline quality. The change of crystalline degree was also found to affect the morphology of Fe-PKU-1 catalysts (Fig. 1d-f). For instance, Fe-PKU-① displays an irregular rod-like morphology. Whereas, the morphology tended to become a ‘perfect’ rod-like shape as the crystalline quantity increased from Fe-PKU-③ to Fe-PKU-⑥. To understand if the surface properties of 18 % Fe-PKU-1 are affected by its crystalline quality, angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (AR-XPS) was employed over Fe-PKU-①, Fe-PKU-③, and Fe-PKU-⑤ ( Fig. 2). A take-off angle of 20° was selected in this study, which approximately corresponds to the top 3–4 at. layers of the catalyst surface [52,53]. Fig. 2a-d showed Al 2p, Fe 2p, B 1 s, and O 1 s states on the surface of all three materials. In the case of Al, we found that only Al3+ species (∼74.7 eV) existed on the surface (Fig. 2a) [54]. For Fe species, both Fe3+ 2p3/2 (711.2 eV) and Fe2+ 2p3/2 (714.6 eV) were found on the catalyst surface and no peak shift was observed as the crystalline changed [55]. The existence of the Fe 2p3/2 satellite peak (∼720 eV) contributed to recognizing the charge transfer between iron and neighboring elements [56,57]. In Fig. 2c, the Bonding Energy (B.E.) of ∼192.7 eV agreed well with that of H3BO3 [58]. In contrast to Fe, this peak moved from 192.6 to 192.9 eV as the crystalline quality of Fe-PKU-1 increased (from Fe-PKU-① to Fe-PKU-③), but shifted back to 192.7 eV when the crystalline quality further increased (Fe-PKU-⑤). Three types of O species, lattice oxygen (OLatt, 531.3 eV), surface chemisorbed hydroxyl groups or other surface oxide species (Oads, 532.5 eV), and adsorbed water (OH2O, 533.5 eV) all appeared on the surface of Fe-PKU-1 catalysts [59]. These B.E. analyses above suggested that the electronic structure of boron was more sensitive towards the crystalline quality than other elements in the catalyst. Table 1 shows the surface composition of Fe-PKU-1 as a function of crystalline quality. Our results suggested that the surface composition (Al, Fe, and B) of all three materials were altered by the crystalline quality. In the case of Al, its concentration decreased from 11.4 % to 6.4 % as the crystalline quality increased (from Fe-PKU-① to Fe-PKU-⑤). In comparison to Al, the surface composition of both Fe and B showed different trends with catalysts crystalline change. The surface composition of Fe-PKU-⑤ catalyst (the sample with the highest crystalline quality among the measured catalysts) was calculated to be 14.3 % and 3.1 % for B and Fe, respectively. However, a volcano-type trend was found for B (22.1 % and 14.0 % in Fe-PKU-③ and Fe-PKU-①, respectively) and an inverted volcano trend was observed over Fe (1.2 % and 2.4 %) with the change of crystalline quality. The results showed that the surface B composition on the Fe-PKU-1 catalyst with a modest crystalline quality (Fe-PKU-③) was almost doubled in comparison to the other two Fe-PKU-1 catalysts (∼14 % for both Fe-PKU-① and Fe-PKU-⑤). It is interesting to note that the surface B composition also exhibited a volcano-type trend with the surface areas of Fe-PKU-①, Fe-PKU-③, and Fe-PKU-⑤ (Fig. S4). By increasing the take-off angles to 40 and 90 degrees, we found that the compositions of Al, Fe, and B were almost homogeneously distributed in all samples down to 3.6 nm (Fig. S5). In addition, both Fe and boron species were reported to function as the acid site in catalysts in general. For example, ferric nitrate was reported to work as a homogeneous Lewis-acid catalyst that could convert Gly to Solketal with 98 % conversion in 30 min [60]. A nearly two-fold increase in yield with high selectivity of 82.8 % was obtained over Fe/HZSM-5 in comparison to HZSM-5 due to the introduction of Fe Lewis-acid centers [61]. As for boron-containing materials, they possessed Lewis acidity due to the presence of vacant p-orbitals, which could facilitate various reactions, such as regioselective hydrothiolation and ring-opening processes of epoxides [62–64]. The acidic properties of the catalysts were claimed to correlate well with the surface composition [65,66]. Thus, a systematic modification of the acidity over Fe-PKU-1 is expected by changing its surface composition. This will be discussed later. Besides, a small amount of FeB x was observed in Fe-PKU-③ (Fig. 2b), which was evidenced by the peak at 707.4 eV in the high-resolution spectrum of Fe 2p [67]. This was also supported by the published results [42] and the EDS mapping of TEM (Fig. S6). However, the associated B.E. of the low-valence boron (<3) was not observed in the same sample. This indicated that B atoms might link to oxygen species to form FeBxOy, which was confirmed by the XRD data (Fig. S1.3). In addition, the B.E. of the B 1 s (192.9 eV) was higher than that in the other two materials (192.6 eV for Fe-PKU-① and 192.7 for Fe-PKU-⑤). These results suggested that the formation of Fe-B bond could promote the electron loss from the B atoms, which might improve their Lewis acidity. Therefore, it is estimated that the Fe-doped alumina-borate with appropriate crystalline quality (Fe-PKU-③) possesses the highest catalytic performance. Similar phenomena were reported in the published work. For example, the electron transfer from boron to Fe in boron-iron nanochains material can rearrange the electron density near the metal active centers, thus facilitating the conversion of nitrogen compounds [68]. The OER performance could be improved by doping boron into the NiFe-based catalyst due to the charge transfer from B to Ni and Fe species [69,70]. In addition, the variation over the content of oxygen vacancies in these Fe-doped alumina-borates may imply the formation of Fe-B bonds (see EPR results shown in Fig. 3), which led to the loss of electrons from boron atoms. This could result in producing strong acidic sites on the catalyst surface, which promoted the acid-catalytic reaction process, such as Gly ketalization. Potentiometric titrations were utilized to measure the concentration of acid sites and their strength over these Fe-doped alumina-borates ( Table 2, Fig. S7a). E i value is used to estimate the acidic strength of these catalysts. Again, volcano trends are found between the surface acidic nature and the crystalline quality. Fe-PKU-③ exhibits the highest concentration of acid sites (0.437 mmol/g) and the strongest acidic strength (142.5 mV) in comparison to other measured Fe-PKU-1 catalysts. The concentration of acid sites for Fe-PKU-①, Fe-PKU-④, and Fe-PKU-⑤ is measured as 0.395, 0.340, and 0.188 mmol/g, respectively. The acidic strength is measured to be 107.0, 81.8, and 54.5 mV for Fe-PKU-①, Fe-PKU-④, and Fe-PKU-⑤, respectively. The results suggest that the enhanced crystalline quality can improve the concentration of acid sites and the acidic strength. Further, the FT-IR studies of pyridine adsorption were performed over these Fe-loaded alumino-borates samples. The results were analyzed, quantified [71], and shown in Table 2 and Fig. S7b. The amount of strong Lewis-acid sites showed a similar trend as the potentiometric titration studies. Therefore, a similar modification over the catalysis is expected. It will be discussed in the following paragraph. To test the influence of the change in materials acidity induced by the surface composition on catalysis, Gly ketalization reaction was investigated over these Fe-doped alumina-borate catalysts. The selectivity of Solketal shows a minor change (95 – 99 %) despite the change of this property ( Fig. 4a and Table 3). This suggests that the surface reactivity of the Fe-PKU-1 catalyst is not changed when its surface properties are modified by the synthesis conditions. Both conversion and TOF values show volcano trends with respect to the quality of Fe-PKU-1 crystalline (Fig. 4a). The trends are similar to the ones of catalyst acidity, which indicates that the catalyst acidity plays a critical role in modifying the surface chemistry of Fe-PKU-1 catalysts. Fe-PKU-③ exhibits the highest catalytic activity (97 % conv. and 54.2 h−1 TOF), which can be attributed to the fact that it possesses the highest surface composition of boron and the strongest acidity among all Fe-PKU-1 type of catalysts. It is interesting to note that the Fe-PKU-③ material exhibits the superior catalytic activity of Gly ketalization over other solid acids reported in recent years ( Table 4). Meanwhile, those catalysts suffer from lower Gly conversion, lower Solketal selectivity, or unsatisfactory TOF values [72–77]. In addition, Fe-PKU-③ also showed a high recycle-stability for Gly ketalization (Fig. 4b), with only a 7.1 % decrease in conversion and 1.4 % loss in Solketal selectivity after five runs. This catalyst showed remarkable bulk structure stability after five reaction cycles, which was evidenced by the XRD pattern. The leaching study (see the method section for details) indicates that the homogeneous iron leaching from Fe-PKU-1 was negligible during the reaction process (see Table S2). The Gly conversion and TOF dropped linearly from Fe-PKU-③ to Fe-PKU-① (see Fig. 4a). These results suggested that the variation over chemical composition and electronic structure of the surface layer, especially surface boron, considerably contributes to the catalytic reactivity change of Fe-PKU-1 catalysts. Thus, Fe-PKU-③ has a high-potential for industrial application due to its enhanced activity, high selectivity and recycle-stability, and the easiness in separation. Since the surface hydrophobicity was reported to affect the Solketal synthesis from Gly, a test of water contact angle was employed to measure the surface water affinity over these Fe-PKU-1 catalysts [78]. Fig. 4a and Fig. S8 show that the surface hydrophobicity of Fe-PKU-1 catalysts drops as their crystalline quality decreases (Fe-PKU-⑥ to Fe-PKU-③), while its acidity and catalytic activity show the opposite trend. When the crystalline quality further reduced (Fe-PKU-③ to Fe-PKU-①), these three different physic-chemical properties all show a downward trend (Fig. 4a). Thus, the volcano trends observed between the catalytic performance of the ketalization reaction and the physic-chemical properties may be caused by the synergy between acidity and hydrophobicity of Fe-PKU-1. 4 Conclusions In summary, a series of physic-chemical properties over Fe-PKU-1 catalysts, such as crystalline quality, surface composition, and acidity, could be altered by modulating the HNO3 concentration and temperature in the synthesis process. Characterized by AR-XPS, the near-surface chemical composition and electronic structure of the Fe-PKU-1 catalysts appear to correlate well with their crystalline quality. In particular, surface boron composition shows volcano trends with the variation of these physic-chemical properties. The surface boron composition of Fe-PKU-③ was about two times higher than any other Fe-PKU-1 materials. A similar volcano trend was also found over the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies. This results in the direct bonding of Fe-B on the catalyst surface, facilitating the electron loss from boron atoms and improving material acidity, especially the Lewis acidity. This effect was confirmed by the results of potentiometric titrations and Py-IR tests. The results of Gly ketalization also showed a nice volcano trend with the variation over the crystalline quality in Gly conversion. This finding helps to understand how the changes in synthesis conditions affect catalytic performance. To be specific, our results suggest that the synthesis temperature and acid concentration can modify the crystalline quality. This allows control over the surface chemistry of the PKU-1 catalyst, which leads to the optimization of the Gly ketalization reaction, finally showing the best results as 97 % conversion and 99 % selectivity in Solketal.

        "dc:description": "A series of Fe-doped alumino-borate catalysts (18 % Fe-PKU-1) with a range of crystalline qualities has been obtained by varying synthesis conditions. Based on Angle-resolved X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, pyridine adsorption infrared spectroscopy, and potentiometric titration, crystalline quality is correlated as volcano trends with the surface composition and electronic structure of Fe-PKU-1, especially for the boron species. Through the systematic change of synthesized conditions, the catalyst with the appropriate crystalline quality shows the highest surface compositions of boron and oxygen vacancies. This leads to strong surface Lewis acidity and results in the high catalytic performance of glycerin ketalization, 97 % conversion and 99 % selectivity in DL-1,2-Isopropylideneglycerol (Solketal).",
