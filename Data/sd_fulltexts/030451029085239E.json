DAVIS Center for Applied Energy Research, University of Kentucky, 3572 Iron Works Pike, Lexington, KY 40511 (U.SA.) (Received October 16,1989; revised April 11,1990) Summary Tin chloride acts as a poison when added at levels of Sn/Ptssl. Ammonium chloride, when added prior to stannous chloride, eliminates the poisoning effect, presumably by converting SnCIa to the SnCIa\" anion. Poisoning by SnClg decreases exponentially with the Sn/Pt ratio. Introduction It is well known that the catalytic properties of platinum can be modified by the addition of other metals. For example, Westfall et al. [1] found that tin alters the high temperature (ca. 480-520 C) dehydrocycliza- tion selectivity and activity of a platinum catalyst. More recent, the promotion of platinum oxide catalysts (a.k.a. platinum black) by tin dichlorides has been reported for liquid-phase hydrogenations [2-4]. Further- more, it is well documented that platinum black is an active and selective catalyst for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and alkyi nitrobenzenes [5-7]. Thus, in this note we report some effects of the addition of tin dichloride on platinum oxide catalysts during nitrobenzene hydrogenation. Experimental All experiments were conducted in a 41 autoclave fitted with four blade baffles to improve mixing. A four blade stirrer was operated at ca. 800 rpm. The reactor is heated by a dual-zone, external electrical heating mantle and is fitted with an internal cooling coil; temperature is maintained by controlling the heating mantle voltage and the flow of cooling water. A sparger for hydrogen addition is located just below the agitator. A sampling line permits samples to be withdrawn for analysis from the liquid phase during the course of a run. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 58 After the reactor was charged with 31 of a methanol solution 0.1 molar in both nitrobenzene and 1-octanol (the internal GC standard), the platinum catalyst (2.5 jumol PtOg per mol nitrobenzene) was added. In those runs in which a promoter was used, it was added after adding the platinum black. The catalyst was a commercial platinum oxide with a surface area of 39 m2 g~1. When the system had been purged four times with hydrogen, the reactor was pressurized to 210 kPa. The temperature was increased to the desired reaction temperature (328 K); the zero-time sample was withdrawn when the desired temperature was attained. Afterwards, samples were withdrawn at intervals to follow the time course of the reaction. Analyses were carried out via gas chromatography using a 6.35 mm x 2 m glass column packed with 3% OV-17 on Chromosorb W-HP 80/100. Results and discussion Because the concentration profile is linear over most of the conversion range, hydrogenation follows zero-order kinetics for nitrobenzene disap- pearance and for aniline formation for all platinum catalysts, with or without tin dichloride (Fig. 1 is typical). Slopes of the concentration profiles in Fig. 1 (open symbols for nitrobenzene disappearance and solid symbols for aniline formation) were used to calculate rate constants. This procedure was repeated with runs using the platinum catalyst alone and with additives. Initially, the rate for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene with the platinum black catalyst was determined, to serve as the basis for comparison with the various promoters. Subsequently, for runs using promoters each 1,0 2.0 3.0 Time (hr) Fig. 1. Concentration profile for the disappearance of nitrobenzene using a platinum black (A) or platinum blacfcSnClz (1:5) (0) catalyst and the appearance of aniline using a platinum black (A) or platinum blacfcSnClz (1:5) ( ) catalyst. 59 individual rate was divided by this base rate to normalize the rate constants. The data in Fig. 2 show the effects of adding other species to the reaction mixture. Sodium acetate, sodium nitrate, ammonium chloride and tin oxide did not alter the reaction in any significant way and, if anything, caused a slight increase in the rate. The rate of hydrogenation decreased when tin chloride was added to a solution containing platinum black. Furthermore, the rate decreased linearly (on a semi-log plot) with the amount of stannous chloride added. Thus, tin dichloride acts as a poison when added to platinum black catalyst, and over the concentration range studied, the extent of catalyst poisoning is exponentially related to the amount of poison added. One of the surprising observations was that when ammonium chloride and tin dichloride were utilized together, the order of addition of these two reagents was important. That is, in runs where ammonium chloride (to provide NH4Cl:SnCl2=2:l) was added before the tin dichloride, the rate of reaction was unchanged from that of the base case. Apparently, a reaction between ammonium chloride and tin dichloride results in a chemical form which is not an effective catalyst poison. Most likely, the following reaction occurs: SnClg + NH4C1 NH^ + SnCla- This suggests that the tin trichloride anion is not a catalyst poison. Likewise, the chloride ion does not appear to be a catalyst poison since it is present in Q 0.001 lii... 0 2 4 6 8 10 Moles Additive/Moles Pt Fig. 2.

In contrast, when tin dichloride was added before ammonium chloride, a poisoning effect was observed. That is, the combination reacted as a catalyst poison and the reaction behavior was essentially the same as when tin dichloride had been added alone. Thus it would appear that the tin dichloride is irreversibly adsorbed on the surface of the platinum black, effectively poisoning the catalyst. Otherwise, the ammonium chloride added would have converted the tin dichloride into the tin trichloride anion, which does not inhibit the reaction. Cerveny et al. [8] observed that when Cu was added to platinum black, activity for nitrobenzene hydrogenation was decreased. Galvagno et al. [4] found that at low concentrations tin promoted platinum, but at higher concentrations acted as a poison. These authors suggest that a PtSn alloy was formed, [4], but they did not define the role of Sn in subsequently decreasing the catalytic activity at higher concentrations. From our results, it appears that tin dichloride is strongly adsorbed on the catalyst surface. It is inviting to assign the catalyst poison to a polymer of tin dichloride, such as the one shown below: Sn Sn Sn Sn 1 / I \\ / I \\ / I \\- / I \\- .Cl Cl Cl Cl Cl Cl til Cl '1 In summary, tin dichloride does not promote platinum oxide catalyst for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene; rather, tin dichloride serves as a catalyst poison whose effect increases in an exponential fashion based upon concentration.
