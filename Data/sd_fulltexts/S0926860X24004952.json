Països Catalans 16 Tarragona 43007 Spain Tin is one of the most selective electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction (CO2RR), mostly thanks to its poor activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Still, Sn electrodes are limited by their very high overpotential. We decided to investigate the electrochemical CO2RR catalytic activity of tin-magnesium alloys that can be easily obtained by thermal annealing from the elemental metallic powders. We found that the alloys exhibit a slightly improved activity and selectivity towards CO2RR with formate as dominant product according to electrochemical and chemical analysis. Post-mortem characterization confirmed that this effect is not due to the alloys performance, but to Sn re-structuration. Most of the Mg is leached from the alloy into the electrolyte during CO2RR, leaving a highly porous Sn structure. These changes in morphology and surface area as triggered by Mg leaching, appear to be at the origin of the enhanced electrocatalytic performance.

For example, the use of electrochemical CO2RR for the production of alcohols is particularly appealing, since their industrial synthesis is dominated by energy intensive methods [2]. The major current challenges for CO2RR are the lack of selectivity to carbon-based products and the need for high overpotentials to activate the CO2 molecule. The former is limited by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the kinetically favoured product due to the simplicity of the reaction mechanism in water electrolytes. On the latter, selectivity is hindered by the many possible products formed on the electrode surface, with the participation of radical pathways, intrinsically difficult to control. Molecular catalysts have shown very high selectivity, although with limited long-term stability [3]. Heterogeneous catalysts typically offer better stability, despite lower selectivity. Among promising CO2RR electrocatalysts, Cu is a preferred material due to its high activity and tuneable selectivity [4]. The performance of Cu-based cathodes can by optimized by doping and morphology [5] to yield a wide variety of products, including CO [6], formate [7], methanol [8,9], and C2+ species [10,11]. One successful strategy to improve and/or tune the activity and selectivity of Cu deals with its combination with a second metal in bimetallic alloys [12,13]. Cu-based electrodes have been successfully incorporated into artificial leaf devices [14]. Other CO2RR catalysts attracting attention are bismuth-based electrodes [15], metal carbides [16], and cyanamides [17] with remarkable selectivity towards methanol. On the contrary, dispersed metal-site on nitrogen-doped carbon are selective towards CO [18]. Bifunctional catalysts, combining CO2 activation and C–C coupling have also shown promising performance, yielding up to hydrocarbons [19]. Sn-based materials are some of the most effective CO2RR electrocatalysts, thanks to the high inactivity of Sn towards HER. As in the Cu case, modification of the Sn environment is also a powerful tool to tune selectivity. Isolated tin sites favor methane evolution [20] and ethanol production has been reported on single Sn-atoms in SnS2 nanosheets [21]. By a far margin, though, most Sn catalysts favor CO2 to formate electroreduction with high faradaic efficiency [22–24]. However, the performance of Sn-based catalysts is still inadequate for practical applications, because of the high overpotentials, and poor stability [25–27]. Interestingly, the alloying strategy has not been exploited with Sn, despite its remarkable success for Cu-catalysts CO2RR [28]. One plausible strategy to modify the CO2RR activity of Sn points towards its alloys with highly electropositive metals, such as alkaline or alkaline earths. Positive effects were found in Mg-Sn alloys in battery research [29], thanks to the different electronic configuration that tin adopts in these systems. Herein we have investigated how the alloying with Mg affects the electrocatalytic performance of Sn. Our findings indicate that the Mg-Sn alloys are not stable under CO2RR conditions because of Mg leaching. However, the remaining porous Sn structures demonstrate an improved performance in terms of activity and selectivity compared to bulk Sn. Our results support the importance of the essential contribution of morphology and operando evolution of catalytic surfaces for the promotion of the electrochemical CO2RR, were most catalytic phases start as pre-catalysts. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 MgSn alloy synthesis and processing The MgSn alloys were obtained following the reported procedure by Ikhe et al. with minor modifications [29]. The alloys were synthetized by melting mixtures of Mg (Magnesium powder >99 %, Sigma aldrich) and Sn (99.8 % 325 mesh, Thermo Scientific) powders in the desired stochiometric. We labelled the alloys according to the Sn ratio as MgSn-0.75 (75 % Sn), MgSn-0.50 (50 % Sn), MgSn-0.33 (33 % Sn), and MgSn-0.25 (25 % Sn). The mixtures were heated under argon in a quartz tube at 700ºC for 12 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the alloys were ball-milled for 15 min (Retsch MM200) using agate jar. To prepare the electrode, 60 mg of the powder obtained was mixed with 300 µL of Nafion®115 ionomer (Sigma Aldrich) and 5.7 mL of a solution EtOH:H2O (3:1) and sprayed over 3 electrodes of carbon paper gas diffusion layer (GDL) of 1 cm2 each (Sigracet 39BB, Fuel Cell components). 2.2 Characterization The alloys were characterized before and after electrochemical CO2RR (see Section 2.3). The crystalline structure of as-prepared catalyst was determined by XRD using a Bruker-AXS D8-Advance diffractometer with a PSD detector and Cukα radiation was obtained from a copper X-ray tube operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Thermo fisher Scientific, Svios 2) was operated at accelerated voltage of 10 kV and a working distance of 7 mm to characterize the morphology of the MgSn alloy catalyst. A JEOL F200 transmission electron microscope ColdFEG operated at 200 kV was used for the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization. TEM images and electron diffraction patterns were acquired with a Gatan OneView camera, a CMOS-based and optical fibre-coupled detector of 4096 by 4096 pixels. Gatan Digital Micrograph program was used to process the TEM images. Samples were inserted in a JEOL beryllium double-tilt holder for energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). TEM-EDS mapping was recorded from an EDS Centurio detector (silicon drift) with an effective area of 100 mm2 and 133 eV of energy resolution. TEM-EDS maps (512 ×512 pixels) were processed with the JEOL Analysis software. The analysis of gaseous products were conducted using a gas chromatograph (Agilent micro-GC 990) equipped with a PoraBOND Q column (L:10 m, ID:0.25 mm, FT:3 μm, 7 in.) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The Injector temperature was maintained at 80ºC, the column temperature set at 100 ºC and the sampling time was 30 s. The liquid products were analysed with a Metrohm 930 Compact IC Flex ion chromatograph. High-resolution XPS was performed with a SPECS spectrometer using an XR 50 MF monochromatic X-ray radiation source (1486.7 eV) and a Phoibos 150 2D CCD hemispherical analyzer and detector. During the experiments, the pressure inside the chamber was set to 5×10−10 mbar or lower. Wide-scan surveys were obtained at Ep=80 eV, with subsequent high-resolution scans of the desired core lines carried out at Ep=50 eV with an acquisition step of 0.1 eV. The samples were placed on double-sided carbon tape. The binding energy values referenced the adventitious carbon peak at 285 eV. To remove the Nafion artifact (used as the binder in electrode ink), samples were sputter-etched under a negative bias of 300 V in an Ar plasma with a pressure of 8.0 P. 2.3 Electrochemical experiments All electrochemical (EC) experiments were performed at room temperature using EC-Lab® Biologic VSP potentiostats and an H-type electrochemical cell equipped with three electrode system including Pt foil as counterelectrode, Ag/AgCl as reference electrode and a carbon paper gas diffusion layer with the sprayed catalyst on the surface (MgSn-GDL) as a working electrode (Fig. S1). As electrolyte a 0.1 M of KHCO3 solution saturated with CO2 (pH 6.8) was used for cathode and anode compartments. A constant gas flow of CO2 (15 mL min–1) was provided to both sides of the H cell. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) data was used to evaluate the activity of the catalysts. Chronoamperometry (CA) at the desired applied potential (2 h) was used to evaluate the faradaic efficiency (FE) and to characterized the alloys after CO2RR. We evaluated the doble layer capacitance (Cdl) by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in the non-faradaic potential range with a scan range between 10 and 80 mV/s with intervals of 10 mV/s. The FE for all the detected gases was calculated using the Eq. (1) where X i is the volumetric fraction of the gas measured, v is the flow rate of CO2 p0 corresponds to 1 atm, R is the gas constant, T corresponds to temperature, F is the Faraday constant, n e is the moles of electrons required for the CO2RR. The liquid products (formate) were quantified using Eq. (2).

This high temperature procedure promoted the obtention of crystalline Mg2Sn alloy as dominant product, despite the different stoichiometry in the powder mixtures, as confirmed by XRD, FESEM and HRTEM analysis ( Fig. 1 and Fig. S2). The cubic structure of Mg2Sn alloy showed the principal diffraction planes (111), (200), (220) and (311) at 2θ = 22.7º, 26.3º, 37.51º and 44.5º, respectively. The metallic Sn tetragonal structure was characterized by the typical XRD peaks at 2θ = 30.8º, 32.4º, 43.9º and 45.1º, corresponding to the (200), (101), (220) and (211) planes. The metallic Mg hexagonal structure was characterized by the peaks at 2θ = 34.5º and 36.7º, related to the (002) and (111) planes, respectively. As the Mg ratio increases, the peaks from hexagonal Mg are more intense, being clearly observable in the MgSn-0.25 (25 % Sn). Since neither chemical nor structural major differences were found in these alloys, and given the better CO2RR performance found in MgSn-0.25 (25 % Sn, see next section), we examined the morphology of this alloy by TEM and FESEM (Fig. 1b, Fig. S2). We found an average particle size about > 5 µm, with Mg and Sn homogeneously distributed in the expected stoichiometry (Table S1) as expected from the solid-state high temperature reaction. 3.2 CO2RR electrocatalytic performance The alloys were converted into fine powders by ball milling and sprayed onto carbon gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) as Nafion®-based inks. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), Chronoamperometry (CA) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) data for these electrodes in a CO2-saturated carbonate buffer showed than only the MgSn-0.25 alloy shows superior performance in terms of current density when compared to pure Sn ( Fig. 2, Fig. S3). Interestingly, all samples showed a significant increment in current density during a CA at a constant applied potential of 0.9 V vs RHE (Fig. 2a). After 2 h, MgSn-0.25 reached a current density of –7.4 mA cm–2, outperforming all other alloys and also metallic Sn (–6.8 mA cm–2). These data suggest an ongoing electrode surface evolution during CO2RR, usually referred as “morphology evolution”. There are several reports that suggest some electrodes tend to restructure under reaction conditions and the performance is highly dependent on the morphological features [30–32]. Thus, the performance can be manipulated by structural evolution or the prevention thereof. The morphological evolution of the catalyst in the initial stages of CO2RR could even lead to an increase in activity/selectivity over time, rather than performance degradation [11,33]. In the LSV data (Fig. 2b), MgSn-0.25 also showed the best performance, with the lowest onset potential (–0.66 V vs RHE). The product analysis for the MgSn alloys during the CA revealed that the presence of Mg slightly increases the Faradaic efficiency (FE) towards formate, although without following a clear pattern. For example, both MgSn-0.25 and MgSn-0.75 catalysts showed a selectivity over 50 % FE to formate production (Fig. 2c) in comparison of a <40 % FE found for metallic Sn. Given these results, we selected MgSn-0.25 for further studies. To determine the reactivity of this catalyst over time, product quantification was carried out for various time points during a 2-h CA experiment at –0.9 V vs. RHE (Fig. 2d). The observed trend shows the faradaic efficiency (FE) for formate (HCOO–) decreases over time, starting at ca. 60 % and stabilizing around 50 %. This decrease is attributed to the leaching of Mg from the electrode surface, increasing the FE towards hydrogen evolution. An analogous study at higher applied voltage showed an increase of the FE towards (HCOO–) reaching a maximum of > 70 % until an applied potential > 1.3 V where HER becomes the dominant reaction (Fig. S4). One particularity of these electrodes is the continuous increase in current density over time. This is observed even in long term CA (> 40 h). A MgSn-0.25 cathode showed an increase in current density over time to reach a stable current after 48 h (Fig. S5), while achieving >10 times the initial current density. Once the current reaches an stable regime, that we associate to the end of the major surface restructuring during CO2RR, because of Mg leaching, we run a second 48 h CA (Fig. S5d). The FE was evaluated along this run, with FE over 55 % after 48 h. 3.3 Post-mortem electrode characterization To get an insight into the changes in performance and surface reconstruction in these Mg-Sn alloys, we carried out post-mortem characterization to be compared with the features of the as-prepared catalyst. HRTEM images show a severe reconstruction, from the initial nanoparticulated material (< 10 nm) into aggregates particles of much larger size (> 200 nm) after CO2RR, also confirming quantitative leaching of Mg by EDX analysis ( Fig. 3a, Table S3). This was also confirmed by PXRD (Fig. 3b) which showed no peaks from the Mg2Sn phase initially observed. After CA, only the peaks corresponding to metallic Sn are maintained. In the same direction, XPS data also shows the disappearance of the Mg peaks (Fig. 3c,e, Fig. S6). Interestingly, the XPS data for the Sn edge (Fig. 3d,f) show a change in its oxidation state, with a significant increment of the peaks corresponding to the metallic phase, and reduction of the peaks from the oxidized phase. Finally, ICP analysis of the electrolyte after a 2 h CA (Table S2) confirmed the mayor leaching of the Mg from the catalyst to the solution during CO2RR operation, with only a minor Sn leaching (in ppm range), comparable to that found in a metallic Sn cathode in the same conditions. The morphology of the MgSn alloys is also drastically changed during the electrochemical reduction reaction (Fig. 3a and S7). The conglomerated initial phase evolves to composite of individual nanoparticles with sharp edges and planar surfaces. It is also interesting to mention that the evolution of the surface is not stopped after complete Mg leaching. Whereas Mg leaching is almost complete in just over 2 h (in this electrolysis conditions), the surface is constantly changing for much longer, as confirmed from > 40 h CA data. The investigation of MgSn alloys as catalysts for CO2 reduction electrocatalysis has revealed some notable insights. Even though these alloys have modest improvements over pure Sn electrodes, particularly in terms of higher current densities and improved selectivity towards formate production, the mechanism driving this improvement is of considerable interest. Under operational conditions, Mg is leached, resulting in the almost complete removal of the Mg component during CO2 reduction. As a result, a porous structure of Sn is left behind, which significantly increases the electrode's effective surface area (ECSA). Thus, higher current densities are observed due to an increased ECSA (Fig. S3). Furthermore, we hypothesize that changes in selectivity can be related to changes in surface morphology and crystallinity caused by the leaching process. Such changes in selectivity as a result of surface reconstruction are not unusual in electrocatalysis. This study highlights the potential of de-alloying techniques for increasing surface area and selectivity, which may find applications in a variety of electrocatalytic reactions other than CO2 reduction. However, it is important to note that the overpotentials revealed in our work are still relatively high for practical applications, indicating the need for future advances in catalyst design to bridge the gap between fundamental research and real-world utility. 4 Conclusions The MgSn alloys show modest improvement when compared to Sn electrodes for the CO2 reduction electrocatalysis. These alloys offer higher current densities, and better selectivity towards formate. The origin of this enhancement is related to the leaching of Mg under operation conditions. Close to total removal of the Mg component occurs during CO2RR, leaving a highly porous Sn structure. The high surface area (ECSA) of this electrode is responsible for the better current densities, whereas the changes in selectivity should be due to the changes in structure and surface morphology. Changes in selectivity due to surface reconstruction are common in electrocatalysis [34–37]. The strategy of de-alloying for achieving higher surface areas and improved selectivity may be useful different electrocatalytic reactions. Still, the overpotentials found in our work are too high for practical applications.

        "dc:description": "Tin is one of the most selective electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction (CO2RR), mostly thanks to its poor activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Still, Sn electrodes are limited by their very high overpotential. We decided to investigate the electrochemical CO2RR catalytic activity of tin-magnesium alloys that can be easily obtained by thermal annealing from the elemental metallic powders. We found that the alloys exhibit a slightly improved activity and selectivity towards CO2RR with formate as dominant product according to electrochemical and chemical analysis. Post-mortem characterization confirmed that this effect is not due to the alloys performance, but to Sn re-structuration. Most of the Mg is leached from the alloy into the electrolyte during CO2RR, leaving a highly porous Sn structure. These changes in morphology and surface area as triggered by Mg leaching, appear to be at the origin of the enhanced electrocatalytic performance.",
