Box 77, H-1525 Budapest, Hungary Department of Chemical Engineering, Rice Universi~, Houston, TX 77251-1892, USA Received 22 September 1995; revised 28 February 1995; accepted 28 February 1995 Abstract The effect of acidic sites on activity and product selectivity has been investigated in 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation over platinum catalysts prepared with high purity A1203 supports (Condea SB, Woelm N, Degussa Alumina C, ICN-N). Degassing the reduced samples at 723 K has increased the selectivity of n-butane formation on catalysts of high platinum dispersion (Dco = 68-93%). Over Woelm and ICN aluminas isomerization of 1-butene formed on platinum sites to cis- and trans-2-butene can also be observed. Poisoning the catalysts with water, ammonia and ethylenediamine (EDA) suppresses isomerization of l-butene, but only EDA hinders markedly formation of n-butane. The results have been interpreted by participation of Lewis acid sites and by contribution of electron deficient platinum sites in the vicinity of the metal-support interface.

Introduction More than ample evidence confirms the view that support materials play a decisive role in influencing the catalytic behavior of metals. It seems that supporting oxides not only retain the metallic component in a highly dispersed state, but through epitaxial, spill-over and migration effects [ 1-4] influence the working surface of catalysts. At the metal-support interface, depending on pretreatment conditions, the supporting oxide can offer sites whose basicity [5,6] or acidity [7- 14] might intervene in the transformation of reacting molecules. Over reducible oxides high temperature reduction leads to an SMSI state which apparently produces * Corresponding author. Tel./fax. ( + 36-1 ) 1564815. 0926-860X/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

Sarkany et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 77-92 new surface sites on the metal surface as a consequence of ligand and ensemble effects of migrating suboxides [ 1-4]. The effect of support sites on the reaction rate and product selectivity has been extensively investigated on TiOz-supported catalysts [1-4]. Results on CO/H2 transformations [ 10], acetone hydrogenation to isopropyl alcohol [ 11 ] and ben- zene hydrogenation [ 12] provide evidence that enhanced activity can be observed under mild reduction treatments. These results emphasize the role of support sites, presumably Ti3 +, rather than geometrically and electrically modified metallic sites. In the hydrogenation of benzene over platinum the turn-over frequency (TOF) has been observed to increase with the acidity of the support; the TOF values are higher on SIO2-A1203 and zeolite supports than on MgO or A1203 [ 13]. Similar results have been observed in the hydrogenation of toluene over supported platinum and palladium [ 14]. The results have been interpreted by the presence of hydrocarbon chemisorption sites on the support which can be accessed by hydrogen spilt over from the metal particles [ 11,12,14]. In most of the hydrogenation studies, alumina is regarded as a relatively inert support in comparison with titania or SIO2-A1203 [1-4]. The objective of the present work is to provide evidence that even on Pt/A1203 the removal of OH groups or the introduction of chlorine by the metal precursor brings about small but reproducible changes in the rate of hydrogenation and product distribution. In this work hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene has been chosen as a sensitive 'chemical probe' of the surface. Over platinum catalysts hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene yields n-butane and butenes simultaneously [ 15-17], and as a previous study has con- firmed on H-Y zeolite, SIO2-A1203, A1203 and MgO [ 18], the selectivity is sen- sitive to the acidity of the support. The acidic sites over Pt/HY and Pt/SiOz-A1203 have unambiguously been shown to facilitate the poisoning of hydrogenation sites and increase the selectivity of n-butane, but the cis/trans ratio is not affected [ 18]. This work reports turn-over frequency and product selectivity data over platinum catalysts of low and high platinum dispersion (Dco ranges from 0.01 to 0.9) prepared with some high purity commercial aluminas such as Alumina C (Degussa), Condea SB and Woelm neutral. The results show that the selectivity of n-butane and butenes is sensitive to the pretreatment conditions (vacuum treat- ment or oxidation at 723 K), and the metal and support sites are not totally inde- pendent but interact to influence each other. In formation of n-butane, participation of Lewis acid sites in the vicinity of platinum particles and/or electron deficient platinum sites are considered. 2. Experimental Hydrogenation experiments were performed in a static recirculation system (vol- ume = 0.187 dm3) attached to a 437A Packard gas chromatograph. The gas com- position was analyzed at 300 K using a 2 m long 1/8 in. column filled with A. Sarkany et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 77-92 79 Table 1 Support materials Support Ref. s.a.

Chromosorb P wetted by 5 wt.-% BMEA (bis-methoxyethyladipate). Data were recorded by a Shimadzu computing integrator. From the gas composition, product selectivities were calculated in accordance with earlier papers [ 19,20] ; the moles of product formed was divided by the moles of butadiene consumed. Throughout this text 'conversion' refers to the transformation of 1,3-butadiene. Most of the experiments were performed at 298 K with a mixture consisting of 1.33 kPa 1,3- butadiene and 5.32 kPa hydrogen. Platinum catalysts of low metal loading were prepared using high-purity alumina supports listed in Table 1. The BET area of the supports, their pore volumes, and the average pore radii were calculated from nitrogen isotherms measured at liquid nitrogen temperature [ 21 ]. On the support samples wetted at ambient temperature, oxygen treated and degassed at 823 K for 1 h ( 10-6 Pa) carbon monoxide adsorp- tion was measured at 300 K. The adsorbed amount recorded at 1.33 kPa cobalt and expressed in mmol CO/m2 is given in Table 1. Measurements with Condea SB and Woelm samples impregnated with water and dried at 423 K gave carbon monoxide uptakes less than 0.001 mmol/m2. As supplied by Condea Chemie the support material (SB) was originally boehmite. After treatment in dry air at 840 K for 4 h its X-ray pattern showed formation of ,/-alumina.

Condea SB pellets were first air treated at 840 K for 4 h, crushed and the particles between 0.2 and 0.3 mm were impregnated with [Pt(NH3)4] (NO3)2. The sample was reduced in hydrogen without drying at 383 K with 5 K/min ramp rate from room temperature to 673 K maintained for 4 h. C: 0.09 wt.-% Pt/A1203-(C). Condea SB air treated at 840 K for 4 h (0.2-0.3 mm fraction) was impregnated with [Pt(NH3)4] (NO3)2 at pH 10.5. The sample was dried at 383 K ( 10 K/h ramp rate, 6 h at 383 K) and oxygen treated at 673 K prior to reduction. D: 0.14 wt.-% Pt/A1203-(D).

HzPtC16 was reduced by HCHO in an alkaline medium. The sample was washed for one week to remove K+, then oxidized and reduced at 773 K to remove carbon and sinter the black. BET surface area is 2.1 m2 g 1. In addition to the above catalysts, four chlorine-containing samples were also prepared: F: 0.21 wt.-% Pt/A1203-(D-C1). Degussa alumina was impregnated with HzPtC16. The sample was dried at 393 K, oxidized in flowing oxygen at 723 K for 6 h, and reduced at 573 K for 20 min. G: 0.49 wt.-% Pt/A1203-(C-C1). Prepared as the previous sample except Condea SB air treated at 873 K (0.2-0.3 mm particles) and [Pt(NH3)4]CI2 +HC1 was used and the sample was reduced without air treatment at 723 K in a stream of hydrogen for 2 h. H: 0.13 wt.-% Pt/A1203- (C-C1). Condea SB 02 treated at 850 K was impregnated with H2PtC16. The sample was calcined at 573 K in argon and reduced at 673 K for 30 min. I: 0.11 wt.-% Pt/AI203-(C-C1). Condea SB air treated at 840 K, crushed and fraction between 0.2 and 0.3 mm was impregnated with [ Pt (NH3) 4 ] Cl2 \"4- HC1. The sample was air treated at 673 K for 1 h and reduced in a hydrogen stream at 723 K for 15 min. Catalysts A-I listed above were treated in oxygen at 723 K and reduced in hydrogen at 723 K prior to chemisorption or activity measurements. Metal disper- sion of the catalysts was tested by carbon monoxide chemisorption in a gravimetric system. In the gravimetric measurements the samples were cooled in hydrogen. Hydrogen was then evacuated at 300 K and 1.33 kPa CO was adsorbed for 30 rain A. Sarkany et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 77-92 81 and evacuated for 5 min (dynamic pressure 10-6 Pa). Hydrogen uptake was determined from thermal desorption tests. The catalysts were cooled in hydrogen from 723 K to 300 K, purged with argon and the sample tube was placed in an oven preheated at 673 K. Hydrogen desorbed was determined from calibration experi- ments injecting 0.1 ml pulses of hydrogen. Hydrogen chemisorption and irreversible carbon monoxide uptakes are summarized in Table 2. Catalysts degassed at 723 K for 30 min were also characterised by measuring D2 exchange of OH groups by an AEI MS-20 mass spectrometer attached to a static circulation system. Hydrogen content of the surface was expressed in mmol OH/m2. 3. Results Catalyst samples ( 10-30 mg) oxidized and reduced at 723 K were either cooled to room temperature in hydrogen and evacuated afterwards (treatment NT), or after oxidation and reduction at 723 K they were evacuated at 723 K for 10-15 rain in 10-5 Pa and cooled to the temperature of the hydrogenation experiments in vacuum (treatment VT). NT, VT and NT treatments were performed successively without removing the catalyst from the reactor. It is to be noted that after oxygen treatment the reactor was evacuated at ambient temperature to about 1-0.5 Pa only, thus the water formed in subsequent hydrogen treatment rehydrates the alumina surface. D2 exchange of OH groups on catalysts A, C and D vacuum treated at 723 K indicated presence of 8.2, 10.0 and 11.2 mmol OH/m2, respectively. With the ICN support we observed 7.8 mmol OH/m2.

Symbols as in Fig. 1. more l-butene, less n-butane and a lower cis/trans ratio than the same sample but evacuated at 723 K (B in Fig. 1). After vacuum treatment (Cat. A-VT), the cis and trans isomers increased continuously at the expense of 1-butene. While after VT the selectivity of n-butane formation is higher by 8-12% than after NT, in both cases its value is nearly independent of conversion. In order to understand the nature of factors influencing the product selectivity, Cat. A-VT sample was treated in 46.6 kPa H2 for 30 min at 298 K. As indicated by the results in Table 3, the subsequent hydrogen treatment which saturates the surface with hydrogen at ambient temperature does not affect significantly formation of n- butane and isomerization of 1-butene (compare Nos. 401 and 399 ). Thereafter, Cat. A was oxygen treated at 723 K ( 14.5 kPa) and either cooled in oxygen to 298 K and evacuated prior to hydrogenation of butadiene ( OTA state), or the evacuation started already at 723 K (OTV) (Table 3, Nos. 403 and 402, respectively). In these experiments the catalysts were reduced only with the H2-BD mixture. Inspec- tion of the results shows that after OTV and OTA treatments the selectivity of n- butane is similar but higher (0.33) than after NT, which observation can be attributed to the imperfect reduction of platinum. It is also evident that the OTV treatment increases the selectivity of cis-2-butene formation. The continuous selectivity increase of cis-2-butene in the early stages of hydro- genation prompted us to consider the activation of the Woelm alumina upon evac- uation at 723 K and the participation of alumina sites in the isomerization of 1-butene. Catalyst samples pretreated by both NT or VT were poisoned at 298 K with water (Nos. 421 and 431 ), ammonia (No. 412 ) and ethylenediamine (EDA, No. 423 ). In each experiment 65-145 Pa substratum was exposed to the catalyst for 5 min and then evacuated at 298 K for 5 min. Distributions are summarized in 84 A.

The effect of vacuum treatment is discern- ible with Cat. C [Dco= 89%, 0.09 Pt/A1203-(C) ] and Cat. D [Dco=78%, 0.14 Pt/AlzO3-(D)]. On both samples VT enhanced the selectivity of n-butane. Measurements using a mechanical mixture of used Cat. D and ICN alumina are shown in Fig. 4. Product selectivities at low and medium conversions on a mixture of platinum black and Woelm alumina are also presented in Table 5. In both mixtures the presence of acidic sites decreases the selectivity of 1-butene formation but it has no effect on n-butane selectivity. Summarized in Table 6 are similar data on product selectivities for samples made from chlorine-containing precursors. In general, the selectivity of n-butane is higher over samples of higher dispersion in both NT and VT states. Upon vacuum treatment the selectivity of n-butene formation is always less than after hydrogen treatment, and the activity is suppressed to a considerable extent over the highly dispersed Cat. I [Dco = 93%, 0.11 wt.-% Pt/A1203-(C-CI) ]. The selectivity values for n-butane and 1-butene as a function of dispersion are collected in Figs. 5 and 6. The turn-over frequency data on 1,3-butadiene con- sumption measured at 298 K are shown in Fig. 7. The number of surface platinum sites considered in calculating TOFs was estimated from irreversible carbon mon- oxide chemisorption (Table 2). 4. Discussion In these experiments hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene has been investigated over platinum deposited on a variety of alumina supports that have different physical 88 A. Sarkany et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 77-92 and chemical properties and that have been pretreated in different ways. The pre- treatments denoted by NT and VT result in two different surface states. The NT state of the catalysts may be regarded as a reference one in the sense that the platinum particles are covered by hydrogen and the number of acidic sites of the support is negligible. Since oxidation-reduction treatments were performed in a closed recirculation system, the water formed poisoned acidic sites. In contrast with NT, vacuum treatment of the reduced surface at 723 K (VT state) removes surface hydrogen from platinum, and through dehydration defect sites become available on alumina as confirmed by carbon monoxide adsorption measurements (Table 1 ). The results obtained with these supported catalysts have many similarities, but they also show, especially after vacuum treatment, some subtle but quite reproduc- ible differences on highly dispersed samples (Dco > 60%) that demonstrate effects of the acidic sites on performance of the catalysts. The similarities include the observation that all supported catalysts have com- parable activities (see turn-over frequencies on butadiene consumption in Fig. 7). When reduced catalysts were evacuated at 723 K, the TOF increased at dispersions 70-85%. Cat. F (Dco = 84%) is an exception; on this sample TOF is less after VT. At the highest dispersion, Dco = 93%, the value of TOF markedly decreases upon the vacuum treatment. The observed TOF values support the conclusion that hydro- genation of 1,3-butadiene shows only limited particle size sensitivity. In liquid- phase hydrogenations over Pt/AI203 TOFs were observed to be independent of dispersion [22]. The observed decrease of activity at the highest dispersion has generally been attributed to 'over-complexation' of adsorbed diene caused by electron deficiency of small particles. Vacuum treatment apparently increases the electron deficiency of highly dispersed platinum particles. Among the differences are the sensitivity of n-butane and butene selectivities to the pretreatment conditions, and the effect of additives such as ammonia, water, and ethylenediamine. Changes in the selectivity with butadiene conversion are also parameters that allow one to assess the relative importance of hydrogenation and isomerization over various supports. As far as the time-dependent variation of 1-butene selectivity is concerned in Fig. 1B, our conclusion is that hydrogenation occurs on platinum sites while isom- erization takes place on the support sites. The independent action of hydrogenation and isomerization sites also appears when platinum black (Table 5, Nos. 513 and 515) or catalyst D [0.14 Pt/A1203-(D), Fig. 4] is mixed with Woelm or ICN alumina, respectively. A mechanical mixture of platinum black and Woelm alumina degassed at 723 K brings about time-dependent variation in the 1-butene selectivity indicating that 1-butene formed on platinum readsorbs and isomerizes on alumina. Over platinum black (Fig. 3) neither the activities nor the selectivities show any significant dependence on pretreatment (VT or NT) or additives (NH3, H20). The selectivity distribution with 1-butene being the dominant product (about 60%) does not change significantly in the conversion range investigated due to the high coverage of diene which prevents readsorption of n-butenes on platinum sites. A. Sarkany et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 77-92 89 Poisoning of the degassed samples (VT state) with water, ammonia or ethylene- diamine blocks acidic sites and results in the selectivity for 1-butene and cis-2- butene remaining essentially constant in the conversion range investigated. The effect of Condea and Degussa samples on the variation of 1-butene/cis-2-butene ratio is less obvious, which can be attributed to the smaller number of coordinatively unsaturated A13 + ions formed after degassing. On these samples the number of carbon monoxide molecules adsorbed (Table 1 ) also provides an indication of a smaller concentration of defect sites. Cis preference has generally been observed in isomerization of 1-butene over various y and 77 aluminas [ 23-27]. The isom- erization activity of the samples and the cis/trans-2-butene ratio, however, are a function of the phase composition, temperature of degassing and particle size [ 23- 27]. A surprising observation is the higher selectivity for total saturation (Fig. 5) on supported catalysts which have been evacuated at high temperature (both support and metal depleted of hydrogen) than was found on catalysts cooled in hydrogen (NT state) where surface hydrogen is plentiful. Reliable differences in n-butane selectivity appear at high (Dco > 60%) dispersions. At medium or low dispersions (Cat. B: Dco = 31% and platinum black: Dco = 2%, respectively) degassing does not exert influence on selectivity of n-butane formation. Similarly, over mechanical mixtures of platinum black and alumina (Woelm or ICN) the effect of Lewis acid sites on the selectivity of n-butane could not be observed. Of n-butenes as presented in Fig. 6 the decrease of the selectivity is the most pronounced for 1-butene. On VT surfaces formation of n-butane surplus is apparently independent of the time-dependent isomerization of 1-butene and indicates a special type of surface sites at the vicinity of the Pt-alumina interface. Poisoning the degassed samples of Pt/AlzO3-(W) by water, ammonia and ethylenediamine completely suppressed isomerization of 1-butene (Fig. 2), but only ammonia and ethylenediamine decreased significantly the formation of n-butane (Fig. 2 and Table 5 ). Apparently VT produces surface sites on which 1,3-butadiene is able to compete with water. These results support the conclusion that different surface sites are responsible for isomerization of 1-butene and formation of n-butane. The higher selectivity of n- butane on degassed samples can be explained by (i) participation of weak Lewis acid sites on the support close to platinum sites and/or (ii) contribution of electron deficient platinum sites formed in the course of degassing according to a formal equation: Ptn(A1-OH) ~ (A1-O-)nPtn+ + (n/2)H2 This oxidation phenomenon, oxidative addition of platinum to a neighbouring OH group of the support, is well known from the decomposition of carbonyl clusters [28-31 ], in which case OH groups make it difficult to form zero valent metal atoms. The presence of chlorine atoms adjacent to OH facilitates formation of Pt- O-A1 bridges. We have also observed that oxygen treatment at 723 K (Table 3, OTV and OTA experiments) increased the selectivity of n-butane formation, which 90 A. Sarkany et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 77-92 observation can be attributed to the presence of ionic platinum. An increase of n- butane selectivity was also observed with degassed samples which under the exper- imental conditions presented did not isomerize 1-butene. Moreover, even on the NT surface selectivity of n-butane increases with dispersion. These observations seem to emphasize the role of electron deficient or Pt-O-A1 sites (coalesced metal- acid sites) at the metal-support interface rather than adsorption and hydrogenation of diene (or alkene) on alumina sites. Formation of n-butane in hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene over platinum has been related to the participation of intermediate carbenes [32,33]. Presence of these multiadsorbed intermediates on platinum is supported by analysis of the deuterium distributions [ 32]. Whether the carbene intermediate returns to 7r-adsorbed alkene via hydrogen shift or forms butane is determined by the hydrogen availability and the electron state of platinum sites. As concerns our results, it seems that these modified, electron deficient platinum sites can serve as traps for 7r-allylic or ~-- alkene intermediates [15,16] facilitating their conversion to carbene type inter- mediates [ 32,33]. As can be judged from comparison of Figs. 5 and 6, formation of n-butane takes place mostly at the expense of 1-butene. This observation can be explained by preferential formation of terminal carbenes. Formation of internal carbenes allowing also trans-cis interconversion causes less significant changes in the selectivity of 2-butenes. The presence of dissolved hydrogen in the bulk (Wells et al. [ 34], Borodzinski and co-workers [35,36]) has been proposed to enhance the selectivity of full hydrogenation. Our results are not consistent with the above proposals. The present results strongly suggest that the activation of the support sites and/or alteration of platinum sites in the course of degassing influence the product formation to a larger extent than the presence of 'excess' hydrogen. Spilt-over or dissolved hydrogen formed in the course of cooling the catalyst in hydrogen has apparently no signif- icant effect on consumption of butadiene. These results are in accord with obser- vations of Aben et al. [ 37 ] who found that the activity for benzene hydrogenation correlated only with the low-temperature hydrogen desorption peak and not with the high-temperature forms (Tmax > 473 K). The higher activity of Cat. I (Dco = 93 %) cooled in hydrogen points to a hydrogen effect which manifests itself in preserving the zero valent state of platinum atoms at the metal-support interface. 5. Conclusions The findings of this work can be summarized as follows. Gas-phase hydrogen- ation of 1,3-butadiene on a series of Pt/Al203 catalysts (Pt dispersion: 1-93%) has confirmed that the turn-over frequency is almost independent of particle size. Pretreatment conditions affect the product selectivity: degassing at 723 K of the reduced catalysts increases formation of n-butane. Isomerization of 1-butene formed on platinum sites has been observed on Woelm and ICN aluminas. The A. Sarkany et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 77-92 91 results can be interpreted by participation of Lewis acid sites and by contribution of electron deficient platinum sites at the vicinity of the metal-support interface.

The effect of acidic sites on activity and product selectivity has been investigated in 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation over platinum catalysts prepared with high purity Al2O3 supports (Condea SB, Woelm N, Degussa Alumina C, ICN-N). Degassing the reduced samples at 723 K has increased the selectivity of n-butane formation on catalysts of high platinum dispersion (DCO=68–93%). Over Woelm and ICN aluminas isomerization of 1-butene formed on platinum sites to cis- and trans-2-butene can also be observed. Poisoning the catalysts with water, ammonia and ethylenediamine (EDA) suppresses isomerization of 1-butene, but only EDA hinders markedly formation of n-butane. The results have been interpreted by participation of Lewis acid sites and by contribution of electron deficient platinum sites in the vicinity of the metal-support interface.

        "dc:description": "The effect of acidic sites on activity and product selectivity has been investigated in 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation over platinum catalysts prepared with high purity Al2O3 supports (Condea SB, Woelm N, Degussa Alumina C, ICN-N). Degassing the reduced samples at 723 K has increased the selectivity of n-butane formation on catalysts of high platinum dispersion (DCO=68–93%). Over Woelm and ICN aluminas isomerization of 1-butene formed on platinum sites to cis- and trans-2-butene can also be observed. Poisoning the catalysts with water, ammonia and ethylenediamine (EDA) suppresses isomerization of 1-butene, but only EDA hinders markedly formation of n-butane. The results have been interpreted by participation of Lewis acid sites and by contribution of electron deficient platinum sites in the vicinity of the metal-support interface.",
