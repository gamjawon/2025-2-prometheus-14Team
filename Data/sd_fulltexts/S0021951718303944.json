Graphical abstract Transition metal non-oxide electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) usually undergo dynamic reconstruction of surface structures, leading to the formation of (oxy)hydroxides as catalytic active layers. Understanding and further controlling the surface evolution under catalytic conditions is of significant importance to develop highly efficient OER catalysts. Here, we present a versatile P-modulation strategy to precisely engineer the reconstruction of active layers of Co(SeP)2 nanobelts under catalytic conditions for efficient OER. Notably, the modulation of P was monitored to facilitate the generation of high-valence oxidized Co sites, promote the formation of oxygen deficiencies, and increase the exposure of active sites in the reconstructed active layers under OER conditions. Accordingly, the P-modulated catalysts exhibited remarkable OER activity. This work provides a framework for understanding catalytic activity on reconstructed surface and enables an ingenious design of highly efficient electrocatalysts through precisely engineering the reconstructed active species under catalytic conditions. Keywords Active layer Reconstruction Oxidation state Oxygen deficiency Oxygen evolution 1 Introduction Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a pivotal role in sustainable energy conversion and storage systems, such as water-splitting devices and rechargeable metal-air batteries, but is kinetically sluggish [1–3]. Although noble metal-based catalysts such as RuO2 and IrO2 have been used as active OER electrocatalysts, the scarcity and high cost significantly impede their practical application [4]. Accordingly, tremendous efforts have been made to develop efficient and cost-effective OER catalysts made of earth-abundant 3d transition metals (TM) [5–7]. In particular, various economical TM non-oxide materials, such as selenides, nitrides, sulfides, phosphides and carbides, have been studied [8–12]. Their unique physical and chemical properties, such as high electrical conductivity and distinct electronic structure [13,14], make them promising candidates for OER. Recent studies have revealed that these non-oxide catalysts underwent a dynamic reconstruction of the catalysts’ surface under OER conditions, leading to the formation of metal (oxy)hydroxide which acts as the catalytic active layer for OER [15]. For example, Liu and co-workers discovered the in-situ transformation of cobalt selenides to cobalt (oxy)hydroxides under OER conditions, identifying the active species of selenides for their activity [16]. Similar phenomenon was also observed by Wu and co-workers, that a thin cobalt oxide/hydroxide layer formed outside the Co4N cores prior to the OER [17]. However, for these non-oxide catalysts, little attention has been paid to controlling and further engineering the reconstruction of active layers under OER conditions. As results, the electrocatalytic performance of these non-oxide catalysts is still far below that of theoretical expectation. Therefore, it is fundamentally important and urgent to develop highly efficient OER catalysts with precise design of reconstructed active layers under catalytic conditions. Herein, we apply a facile P-modulation method to precisely engineer the reconstruction of active layers of Co(SeP)2 nanobelts under catalytic conditions for efficient OER. Through the electrochemical activation under OER conditions, activated Co(SeP)2 electrocatalysts with reconstructed CoOOH/Co(OH)2 layers were obtained. Of note, the modulation of P was demonstrated to facilitate the generation of highly oxidative Co sites, promote the formation of oxygen deficiencies, and increase the exposure of active sites in the reconstructed active layers. Benefiting from the ingenious design of the active layers, the activated Co(SeP)2 catalysts exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic performance towards OER. The overpotential of activated Co(SeP)2 catalysts was 288 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, much lower than that of activated CoSe2 catalysts. Moreover, the activated Co(SeP)2 catalysts showed a high current density of 20.78 mA cm−2 at the overpotential of 0.30 V, which was 6.1-fold higher than that of the activated CoSe2 catalysts. 2 Experiment section 2.1 Preparation of Co(SeP)2 nanobelts and activated Co(SeP)2 catalysts Before the electrochemical activation, Co(SeP)2 nanobelts were firstly fabricated through a typical phosphorization process. In detail, the synthesis included two steps: first, CoSe2-diethylenetriamine nanobelts were prepared by previous protocol [18]. Co(AC)2·4H2O (249 mg) and Na2SeO3 (173 mg) were added into a mixed solution (40 mL) containing DETA and water (VDETA/Vwater = 2:1) under magnetic stirring. The reaction mixture was transferred into an autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 16 h. The obtained samples were collected and dried under vacuum. Second, 10.8 mg of the as-prepared samples and 100 mg of NaH2PO2·H2O were added into a ceramic crucible with NaH2PO2·H2O at the upstream side. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 400 °C for 1 h in N2 atmosphere. The flow rate was 40 sccm. The Co(Se0.59P0.41)2 nanobelts were obtained after being washed three times with ethanol and water. The P molar percentage was controlled by simply varying the amounts of NaH2PO2·H2O without changing the other conditions. Specifically, with the addition of 60 and 30 mg of NaH2PO2·H2O, Co(Se0.64P0.36)2 and Co(Se0.68P0.32)2 nanobelts were fabricated respectively. In addition, pure CoSe2 nanobelts were obtained without the addition of NaH2PO2·H2O. Activated Co(SeP)2 catalysts (A-Co(SeP)2) were obtained by in-situ electrochemical activation of the prepared Co(SeP)2 nanobelts in an O2-saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte through applying forty potential sweeps between 1.02 and 1.50 V (vs. RHE) at a sweep rate of 50 mV/s. A-Co(SeP)2 was obtained after collection by centrifugation and being washed three times with ethanol and water. 2.2 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical measurements were performed with an IM6 electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Germany) using a three-electrode system. The OER performance was evaluated using a graphite rod as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. All the potentials in 1 M KOH were referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) calibration through RHE calibration (E RHE = E Ag/AgCl + 1.02 V). Approximately 4 mg of powders was mixed with isopropanol alcohol (0.25 mL), DI water (0.75 mL), and 40 μL of 5 wt% Nafion by ultrasonication. Then, suitable microliters of the suspension was dropped onto the glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE) with the loading amount of 200 μg cm−2. The polarization curves were recorded in O2-saturated 1 M KOH solution by sweeping the potential from 1.2 to 1.6 V (vs. RHE) at a scan rate of 5 mV/s and a rotation rate of 1600 rpm. The durability tests were carried out at room temperature by potential cycling between 1.2 and 1.52 V (vs. RHE) at 100 mV/s in 1 M KOH. ECSA was determined by CV at the potential window of 1.17–1.27 V (vs. RHE), with varied sweep rates of 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 mV/s. 2.3 Characterizations HRTEM, HAADF-STEM images and EDX analyses were obtained using the JEOL ARM-200F field-emission transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. TEM images were collected on the Hitachi H-7650 transmission electron microscope with 100 kV acceleration voltage. XRD measurements were carried out using the Philips X'Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The metal concentrations of Co, P, and Se were measured by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (Atomscan Advantage, Thermo Jarrell Ash, USA). X-ray photoelectron spectra were collected on Thermo ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. 3 Results and discussion To begin with, CoSe2-diethylenetriamine nanobelts with smooth and flexible morphology were prepared (Fig. S1). The Co(SeP)2 nanobelts were then obtained via a phosphorization process between CoSe2-diethylenetriamine and hypophosphite. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the TEM image shows that the belt-like morphology for Co(SeP)2 was basically retained after the phosphorization treatment. Meanwhile, as marked by white cycles, large amounts of irregular voids were observed in the structure, mainly deriving from the strain release caused by the large lattice mismatch between Se and P [19]. Fig. 1B shows the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Co(SeP)2 nanobelts. The periodic lattice spacing of 2.6 Å was assigned to the (1 1 1) planes of orthorhombic CoSe2. Moreover, several interconnected domains with various orientations and boundaries were present in the nanobelts. Fig. 1C shows the HRTEM image of the region marked by the box in Fig. 1B. The lattice spacing corresponded to (1 1 1) planes of orthorhombic CoSe2. The lattice dislocations were clearly observed, which were attributed to the large lattice mismatch after the phosphorization process. Such distortions facilitate a small lattice domain to change orientation owing to the lowered energy barriers, leading to the generation of abundant boundaries [20]. In contrast, without the addition of P, the pure CoSe2 nanobelts showed a typical monocrystalline nature, further demonstrating the engineered structure of Co(SeP)2 nanobelts induced by the substitution of P (Fig. S2). Fig. 1D shows the high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and corresponding STEM energy-dispersive X-ray (STEM-EDX) elemental mapping images of the Co(SeP)2 nanobelt. The images clearly exhibited the presence of large amounts of voids and homogeneously spatial distribution of Co, Se, and P. The P/Se ratio in the sample was determined as 0.69 by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis, as such we denoted it as Co(Se0.59P0.41)2 nanobelts. The P content in the sample was calculated to be 25%. By simply varying the amount of hypophosphite precursors added, similar nanobelts with P/Se ratios of 0.56 and 0.47 were prepared, denoted as Co(Se0.64P0.36)2 and Co(Se0.68P0.32)2 nanobelts, respectively. The corresponding P contents in the samples were determined to be 21% and 18%, respectively. The Co(SeP)2 nanobelts with various P/Se ratios showed the similar belt-like morphology with the typical orthorhombic structure (Fig. S3). To investigate the electronic structures of Co(SeP)2 nanobelts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out. As shown in Fig. S4A, the binding energies of P 2p 3/2 at 129.6 eV and P 2p 1/2 at 130.4 eV in Co(Se0.59P0.41)2 corresponded to phosphide, confirming the introduction of P anions to CoSe2 [21]. The binding energy of Co 2p 3/2 and Co 2p 1/2 was at 778.5 and 793.5 eV, respectively, which can be assigned to Co2+ cations in CoSe2 (Fig. S4B) [22]. The shake-up satellites on the higher energy side of Co 2p signal can be attributed to the antibonding orbital between Co and Se [23]. Notably, with the addition of P anions, Co 2p XPS peaks showed a gradual shift to higher energy side. The increased binding energies of Co make Co(SeP)2 more electrophilic, facilitating the nucleophilic reaction by OH− and thus promoting the electrochemical oxidation of Co(SeP)2 under OER conditions [24,25]. Before the OER measurements, a typical electrochemical activation process was performed to ensure the sufficient generation of (oxy)hydroxide active species on the metal non-oxide catalysts. In view of the significant changes during activation, the activated Co(SeP)2 catalysts are collectively called “A-Co(SeP)2” in our discussion. To gain a deep insight into the catalysts activated under OER conditions, systematic examination of A-Co(SeP)2 was carried out. Fig. 2 A shows the TEM image of A-Co(SeP)2. The catalyst exhibited a porous morphology with many interconnected nanosheets, implying the structure evolution during activation. In particular, relative to A-CoSe2, interconnected nanosheets with more boundaries were observed in A-Co(SeP)2, indicating the increased exposure of active sites (Fig. S5). Fig. 2B shows the HRTEM image of the regions marked by the box in Fig. 2A. The absence of periodic lattice indicates the nearly amorphous structure. The structure information was further probed by XRD. As shown in Fig. S6, the XRD pattern of A-Co(SeP)2 suggests the disappearance of Co(SeP)2 and the formation of an amorphous phase. As results, the A-Co(SeP)2 possess a porous morphology with an amorphous structure. Fig. 2C shows HAADF-STEM and corresponding STEM-EDX elemental mapping images of A-Co(SeP)2. The results incontestably demonstrate the porous nanostructure and the homogeneously spatial distribution of Co and P. In comparison with Se signal in initial Co(SeP)2 nanobelts, the signal for Se in A-Co(SeP)2 nearly vanished. The change of composition was further examined by the EDX spectrum. As shown in Fig. 2D, the signal for Co, Se, P were clearly observed in the initial Co(SeP)2 nanobelts. In comparison, the intensive Se peaks disappeared completely in A-Co(SeP)2, confirming the transformation of Co(SeP)2 induced by the electrochemical activation under OER conditions. The inconspicuous intensity of P peak indicates the presence of a slight amount of P after activation. The P/Co ratio in A-Co(SeP)2 was further determined to be 0.05 by ICP-AES analysis, much lower than that in initial Co(SeP)2. The dramatically decreased P and Se further demonstrated the conversion of Co(SeP)2 during electrochemical activation. XPS analysis was employed to investigate the evolution of surface composition and oxidation states of the catalysts during activation. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the binding energies of Co 2p 3/2 peaks were shifted from 778.5 eV in Co(SeP)2 to 780.2 eV and 781.4 eV in A-Co(SeP)2, which can be respectively assigned to Co3+ cations in CoOOH and Co2+ cations in Co(OH)2, suggesting the surface oxidation of A-Co(SeP)2 [26]. The shake-up satellite at 785.2 eV further indicates the existence of Co2+ in Co(OH)2 [27]. The P 2p peak of A-Co(SeP)2 was found at the typical binding energy of 133.7 eV for oxidized P species (Fig. 3B) [28]. The disappearance of P 2p peaks for phosphide further implied that the trace amount of P in A-Co(SeP)2 presented as oxidized P species. Moreover, the Se Auger peak at 137.4 eV vanished completely in A-Co(SeP)2 [29], together with the disappeared Se 3d peaks (Fig. 3C), further indicating the oxidation of A-Co(SeP)2 during activation. As shown in the O 1 s XPS spectra of A-Co(SeP)2, O species are fitted into four contributions, which were denoted as Oi, Oii, Oiii, and Oiv (Fig. 3D). The Oi subband at 529.9 eV is attributed to the Co-O bonds. The Oii peaks at 530.8 eV are assigned to the O from Co-OH bonds. The Oiii peak at 531.3 eV is associated with a large number of defect sites with low oxygen coordination. The Oiv peak at 532.1 eV derives from the surface-adsorbed water molecules [30,31]. Specially, relative to that in Co(SeP)2, the higher intensity of Oi subband and absence of Se-O bond were observed in A-Co(SeP)2, in accordance with the oxidation of A-Co(SeP)2 during activation. Moreover, the appearance of Oiii peak in A-Co(SeP)2 suggests the generation of abundant oxygen deficiencies during activation. The promoted generation of oxygen deficiencies is attributed to the presence of oxidized P species in A-Co(SeP)2, which stunts the oxidation of Co(SeP)2 during activation and thus induces more defects in A-Co(SeP)2 [32]. As for the Co-based electrocatalysts, previous mechanistic studies have revealed that in-situ oxidation of Co sites from Co2+ to Co3+/4+ occurs during OER. Then the highly oxidative Co3+/4+ is believed to facilitate the formation and subsequent deprotonation of the adsorbed OOH species, giving rise to the promoted O2 evolution [33–36]. Accordingly, the promoted formation of high-valence oxidation states of Co sites in active layers is particularly critical to enable high OER performance. To gain an in-depth insight into the Co oxidation states of A-Co(SeP)2, the comparison of Co 2p XPS peaks with A-Co(SeP)2 and A-CoSe2 was carried out. As shown in Fig. 4 A, all the activated catalysts showed two main Co 2p 3/2 peaks, which could be attributed to Co3+ cations in CoOOH and Co2+ cations in Co(OH)2. Specially, the binding energies of Co 2p 3/2 peaks showed an increase with the addition of P, indicating the increased oxidation states of Co sites in the active layer. The increased Co oxidation states can be attributed to the promoted electrochemical oxidation of Co(SeP)2 induced by P anions. The addition of P could make Co(SeP)2 more electrophilic to facilitate the reaction with OH− during activation, leading to the promoted generation of high-valence oxidative Co sites in A-Co(SeP)2. Fig. 4B shows the relative atomic ratio of Co3+/Co2+ in A-Co(SeP)2 obtained by comparing the area that the fitted curve covered. Notably, with the addition of P, an obvious increase in Co3+/Co2+ ratio from 0.8 to 1.8 was observed, suggesting the facilitated formation of high-valence oxidation states of Co sites in the generated active layers under OER conditions and thus promoted OER performance. The facilitated oxidation of active species was further confirmed by the O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 4C). The relative content of the contributions in O 1s was summarized in Fig. 4D. Of note, with the increase of P, an increase in the content of O from CoO bonds (Oi) and a significantly decrease in the content of O from CoOH bonds (Oii) were observed. In view of the fact that these two kinds of oxygen obtain similar ratio of nearly 1/1 in the typical CoOOH compound [37], the increased Oi/Oii ratios implied the facilitated formation of CoOOH and thus the increased population of highly oxidative Co sites in the active layer of A-Co(SeP)2. In addition, a clearly increased O content from oxygen deficiencies (Oiii) was also observed, indicating that more oxygen deficiencies generated in the active layers during activation with the addition of P. The presence of oxygen deficiencies in Co-based oxide/hydroxide are believed to facilitate the adsorption and dissociation of H2O, leading to promoted OER rates [38–40]. In view of the fact that the induced porous structure by P modulation could also have an impact on the generation of high-valence oxidative Co sites due to the exposure of active sites, we evaluated the electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) of A-Co(SeP)2 through capacitance measurements via CVs at different scan rates (Fig. S7). The linear slope, which was obtained by plotting the charging current differences (Δj) against scan rates, is twice of the double layer capacitance (C dl) and serves as a representative for ECSA (Fig. 5 A). As shown in Fig. 5B, the ECSA of A-Co(Se0.59P0.41)2 was 63.0 mF cm−2, which is 2.2 times higher than that of A-CoSe2, respectively. Notably, the increased ECSA can be achieved by the incorporation of P, which indicates the increased exposure of active sites in A-Co(SeP)2 for OER. To assess the electrocatalytic OER performance of A-Co(SeP)2, we conducted the electrochemical measurements in 1 M KOH solution using a standard three-electrode system. Fig. 6 A shows the typical polarization curves determined by linear sweep voltammetry at a slow sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. Before comparison, the ohmic potential drop (iR) losses induced by electrolyte resistance were all corrected. Notably, relative to A-CoSe2, all of the A-Co(SeP)2 showed higher current densities and earlier OER onset potentials. To achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−2, which represents a metric relevant to solar fuel production, A-Co(Se0.59P0.41)2 showed the lowest overpotential of 288 mV among all the measured catalysts. Meanwhile, the current densities at the fixed overpotential of 0.30 V were further summarized to directly make a comparison of electrocatalytic performance. As shown in Fig. 6B. A-Co(Se0.59P0.41)2 exhibited the highest current density of 20.78 mA cm−2, which was 6.1, 2.7, and 1.7 times as high as that of A-CoSe2, A-Co(Se0.68P0.32)2, and A-Co(Se0.64P0.36)2, respectively. The boosted current density of A-Co(Se0.59P0.41)2 suggested the remarkable OER performance. Moreover, the corresponding Tafel plots in Fig. 6C showed that A-Co(Se0.59P0.41)2 possessed a much smaller Tafel slope of 36 mV dec−1 than that for A-CoSe2 (71 mV dec−1). Such a small Tafel slope for A-Co(Se0.59P0.41)2 indicated the significantly accelerated OER kinetics. The OER performance of A-Co(Se0.59P0.41)2 is comparable to those of many other transition metal selenides catalysts and cobalt phosphides catalysts (summarized in Tables S1 and S2). In addition, continuous potential cycling in O2-saturated 1 M KOH solution was performed to evaluate the OER durability of A-Co(Se0.59P0.41)2. As shown in Fig. 6D, an imperceptible variation in the curves was observed after 1000 potential cycles, demonstrating the remarkable durability of A-Co(SeP)2. The ECSA of A-Co(Se0.59P0.41)2 after OER tests was measured to be 59 mF cm−2, which showed only a 6.3% decrease relative to that before tests, indicating the good durability of A-Co(SeP)2 (Fig. S8). The P/Co ratio of A-Co(Se0.59P0.41)2 after OER tests was measured to be 0.05, which was consistent with that of A-Co(Se0.59P0.41)2 before OER, further suggesting the good durability of A-Co(SeP)2. The durability of A-Co(SeP)2 was further confirmed by the retained morphology observed with TEM characterization (Fig. S9). Furthermore, to gain an in-depth investigation on the OER performance, we compared the specific activities of A-Co(SeP)2 that were normalized by active surface areas. As shown in Fig. S10A, all of the A-Co(SeP)2 showed earlier OER onset potentials and higher current relative to A-CoSe2. At the overpotential of 0.30 V, A-Co(Se0.59P0.41)2 showed a normalized current density of 0.04 mA cm−2, which was 2.9 times higher than that of A-CoSe2, indicating the intrinsically improved activity. Moreover, A-Co(Se0.59P0.41)2 showed a normalized Tafel slope of 39 mV dec−1 (Fig. S10B), much lower than that of A-CoSe2 (66 mV dec−1), further demonstrating the largely promoted OER kinetics. Taken together, the enhancement on the catalytic performance for A-Co(SeP)2 could be attributed to the following factors: (i) facilitated generation of high-valence Co sites, (ii) tailored oxygen deficiencies, and (iii) increased exposure of active sites, leading to the promoted OER rates. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, we have demonstrated a facile P-modulation strategy to precisely engineer the reconstructed active layers of Co(SeP)2 under catalytic conditions for enhanced OER activity. In detail, with the modulation of P, engineered active layers with facilitated formation of high-valence oxidation states of Co sites, tailored oxygen deficiencies and increased exposure of active sites were achieved in the activated A-Co(SeP)2 catalysts under OER conditions. Therefore, the A-Co(SeP)2 catalysts exhibited a significantly enhanced OER performance with a 6.1-fold higher activity relative to A-CoSe2. We believe that this strategy provides important guidance in understanding catalytic activity on reconstructed catalyst’s surface and fabricating highly efficient electrocatalysts based on the controllable design of the reconstructed active layers under catalytic conditions.

        "dc:description": "Transition metal non-oxide electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) usually undergo dynamic reconstruction of surface structures, leading to the formation of (oxy)hydroxides as catalytic active layers. Understanding and further controlling the surface evolution under catalytic conditions is of significant importance to develop highly efficient OER catalysts. Here, we present a versatile P-modulation strategy to precisely engineer the reconstruction of active layers of Co(SeP)2 nanobelts under catalytic conditions for efficient OER. Notably, the modulation of P was monitored to facilitate the generation of high-valence oxidized Co sites, promote the formation of oxygen deficiencies, and increase the exposure of active sites in the reconstructed active layers under OER conditions. Accordingly, the P-modulated catalysts exhibited remarkable OER activity. This work provides a framework for understanding catalytic activity on reconstructed surface and enables an ingenious design of highly efficient electrocatalysts through precisely engineering the reconstructed active species under catalytic conditions.",
