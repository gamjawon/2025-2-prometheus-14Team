The order of the reaction in copper is fractional and depends on the N/Cu ratio and the bas;/Cu ratio, indicating that there are at least two possible rate-determining steps, i.e. the formation of a dinuclear ;opper species and the phenol oxidation. EPR spectroscopy perfoniic'J on frozen solutions v;;h varying li;;.;r.d n-> copper ratios shows that all Cu(II) is converted into the precursor complex at a ratio of 4 to 1. whereas in kinetic experiments, maximum activity and selectivity are reached only at a ratio of at least 30 to i. Base is needed as a co-catalyst, and the maximum reaction rate is reached at a base to copper ratio of 1.8 to 1. The solid-state X-ray structure of the catalyst precursor complex has been determined to be [Cu(Nnii/.)_,(NO,)_;], monoclinic, space group P2^/n, u = 8.452(1) A. h = 1376(2)A, c = 12.821(2) A, - 94.88(2) Z = l, R = 0.049 for 3525 reflections. This structure consists of an axially elongated octahedral N40; chromophore, which is in agreement with fro/en-solution EPR spectra. Investigations under conditions where water and dioxygen were carefully excluded, have shown that for the phenol oxidation step the presence of dio?;ygen is not required. However, the reaction does require a trace of water (or hydroxide) to form the reactive intermediate. A modified reaction mechanism for the oxidative coupling is presented with special attention to the first steps of the reaction and the equilibrium species present in solution. The role of dioxygen appears to be only to reoxidize the formed Cu(I) ipecies and to regenerate base.

Introduction coupling polymerization of 2,6-dimethylphenol (DMP), as shown schematically in Fig. 1 [1]. In 1959 Hay and co-workers discovered that Since then a number of copper compounds with a copper(I)-pyridine complex in the presence of nitrogen-donor ligands have been investigated dioxygen was able to catalyze the oxidative and proven to be successful as a catalyst in this system [2-11].

Overall reaction scheme tor the oxidalive coupling o) DMP to^PPE and DPQ. chain polyphenylene ether (PPE) by C-0 cou- pling of DMP in high yield and of high molecu- lar mass. The non-catalyzed reaction takes place only at 300 and yields a crosslinked polymer with inferior mechanical properties. Polyphenylene ether is an important engi- neering plastic, because of its outstanding me- chanical properties at elevated temperatures and its good weathering resistance. It has for in- stance applications in filter stacks, filter discs, valve seats, hot water tanks, automotive fixtures and computer housings [12,13]. It is sold by General Electric blended with polystyrene under the name Noryl The other main product of the reaction, re- sulting from C-C coupling of two phenols, is an intensely coloured diphenoquinone (DPQ '). The formation of DPQ not only decreases the yield of polymer, but also degrades the polymer upon further processing at high temperatures. Therefore extensive, and thus expensive, purifi- cation is often needed. It is therefore important to suppress the (oimation of this side product as. much as possible [14]. The selectivity of the reaction (i.e. PPE vs. DPQ formation) is governed by a number of factors, the most important one being the pres- ence and size of the phenol ortho substituents. When no (or only one) substituent is present, a complex mixture of worthless branched prod- ucts will result. Small ortho substituents favour polymer formation, whereas large ones will lead Systematic name: 4-(3.5-diiethyl-4-oxo-2.5-cyclolie- xadienylidene)-2.6-dimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadienone. to formation of diphenoquinones [1,12,15]. Therefore 2,6-dimethylphenol is the most com- monly used substrate. Another factor is the na- ture of the amine ligands coordinated to the copper catalyst. Small and strongly basic lig- ands favour polymer formation [8,16]. Tempera- ture and solvent polarity also influence the ratio of C-C to C-0 coupling. An increase in either of these reaction parameters will result in more diphenoquinone [14]. Because of the importance of the PPE as an engineering plastic, many aspects of the reac- tion and its mechanism have been studied in detail [4,12,17-28]. However, so far the exact mechanism is not yet clear. Historically, the reaction mechanism was thought to employ mononuclear copper-phenoxo complexes af- fording phenoxy radicals as the key species. Other, more recent proposals [14,21,23,29] are more inclined towards a two-electron transfer mechanism, with formation of phenoxonium cations as intermediates. The most recent pro- posals by Challa and co-workers [14,21], as shown schematically in Fig. 2, involve the for- mation of a dinuclear phenolate-bridged copperOD complex, after initial deprotonation of the phenol by the base that is used as co- catalyst, This dinuclear phenoiato-bridged complex will then undergo, in what is heaved to be the rate-limiting step, two one-electron transfers from one bridging phenoiate to the copper ions, resulting in a, possibly, dinuclear coppeKO species and a phenoxonium cation. This cation may then react with a (possibly coordinated) phenol, which will result in C-0 coupling. This will afford the dimeric phenol (after deprotona- tion and tautomerization). After reoxidation of the copperO) species by dioxygen the dimer phenol can react further and will ultimately afford the polymer. The reduced dioxygen will eventually fon/> water. Hence, the reaction is more accurately called a dehydrogenation than an oxidation as no dioxygen is incorporated into the products. Also possible is the C-C coupling of a phenoxonium cation and a phenol, resulting P.J.

Schematic caialylic cycle for the oxiiJulive coupling ul\" DMP [14.21] in the formation of a bisphenol that will be oxidized to afford DPQ. The fact that the mechanism of formation of this important polymer is still not elucidated satisfactorily is the main origin for an ongoing study to the understanding of the first steps in this reaction. Furthermore, the catalytic system bears some resemblance to the mechanism of action of copper proteins with a type 3 active site, e.g. tyrosinase. which also justifies a de- tailed mechanistic study. The ultimate goal is, of course, to obtain a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism, with respect to the copper geometry, possible formation of clusters, structures of intermediates and the mode of action of the actual phenol coupling step. There- fore, insight is required into the following sub- jects: (i) the role of the amine ligand; (ii) the role of the base co-catalyst; (iii) a possible additional role of dioxygen, apart from reoxidiz- ing copper(I) [30]; (iv) the nature and structure of the copper intermediate species. In order to achieve these goals, kinetic (quantiL^ive dioxygen uptake), spectroscopic (EPR, UV/Vis/NIR) and X-ray measurements have been performed. A^-methylimidazole (Nmiz) has been chosen as a model ligand, because it forms very active and rather selective catalysts [2] and for its resemblance to biologi- cal systems where the copper atoms are com- monly surrounded by histidine amino acids, which contain imidazole residues. As a copper salt copper(!l) nitiic was us1, TO prevent inter- ference from a strongly coordinating anion. The firsi important results of these experiments are presented in this paper, including a molecular structure determination for the copper(II)-/V- methylimidazole catalyst precursor. 2. Experimental 2.1. General Solvents (toluene, methanoi and diethyl ether) were obtained from Baker as analytically pure grades. THF was obtained from Janssen as chemically pure grade. Methanol was dried on molecular sieves (3 A) prior to use, toluene was used as received. Diethyl ether and THF were distilled from sodium sand under a dinitrogen atmosphere. CuO^IO-,):, 3H^O (analytically pure) was obtained from Merck and was used without further treatment. CuCl,-2H^O (ana- 198 P.J. Baesjoii et cil. / Journal of Molecular Culalysis A: Chemical 111X1996) 195-210 lyrically pure) was also obtained from Merck, and was dehydrated by heating it under reduced dinitrogen pressure. 2,6-dimethylphenol (techni- cal grade) was purchased from Baker and was purified by repeated crystallization from n- hexane prior to use. YV-Methylimidazole (99% pure) was used as obtained from .(anssen. Sodium methoxide (NaOCH^) was synthesized by treating methanoi (vide supra) with sodium metal under a dinitrogen atmosphere. Subse- quent removal of the remaining methanoi under reduced dinitrogen pressure afforded NaOCH, as a white, fluffy powder. Dioxygen uptake experiments (vide infra) were performed using apparatus designed in- house, described in detail in an earlier publica- tion [9]. Experiments conducted under a dry dinitrogen atmosphere were performed using standard Schlenk techniques. EPR spectra were recorded on a JEOL JES-RE2X ESR spectrome- ter (X-band) equipped with a JEOL Esprit 330 ESR data system. UV/Vis/NIR spectroscopy was performed using a Perkin Elmer 330 double beam spectrophotometer or a Camspec M302 single beam spectrophotometer, 2.2. Catalyst and substrate solutions A typical catalyst solution was prepared by mixing, in a 10 ml volumetric flask, 2 ml of a 0.05 M Cu(N03)2 3H^O solution in methanoi, the appropriate amount of a 0.5 M Nmiz solu- tion in toluene, and filling it up to 10 ml with toluene, which resulted in a 0.01 M Cu(Nmiz),.(NO^ solution in toluene/methanol (4/1 v/v). The substrate solution was prepared by mix- ing, in a 25 ml volumetric flask, 10 ml of a 0.75 M DMP solution in toluene/methanol (13/2 v/v), the calculated amount of a 0.125 M NaOCH^ solution in methanoi as a co-catalyst, and filling it up with toluene/methanol (13/2), which resulted in a 0.3 M DMP/DMPO\" solu- tion in toluene/methanol (about 5/1 v/v). The solvent composition varies slightly as the amount of methanoi in the solution is dependent on the amount of base used. However, the effect on the rate and the selectivity of the reaction due to this variation in solvent composition was found to be negligible. 2.3. Dioxygen uptake measurements In a typical quantitative, time-resolved dioxy- gen uptake experiment, one compartment of a special reaction vessel was filled with 5 ml of a catalyst solution, and the other with 10 ml of a substrate/base solution. Thus, the resulting re- action mixture was 0.00333 molar in copper and 0.20 molar in DMP. hence the DMP to copper ratio was 60 to 1 for all kinetic measurements. The reaction vessel was connected to a shaking device and placed in a thermostated bath of 298 K. After flushing the entire system with dioxy- gen the measurement was started by turning on the shaking device and after a 30 s period for equilibration reliable measurements were ob- tained. The shaking frequency is ca. 15-20 Hz, which not only ensures thorough, immediate mixing of the reactants, but also prevents dioxy- gen diffusion limitation. During mixing, dioxy- gen is being consumed by the reaction system. The decrease in pressure in the system is equal- ized by pushing water into a gas burette filled with dioxygen, thereby pushing dioxygen into the reaction vessel. The rise of the water level in the burette, which is proportional to the amount of dioxygen consumed by the reaction system, is optically monitored and directly recorded by a computer as a function of time. From the resulting dioxygen uptake curve, the initial dioxygen uptake rate can be derived, as it is proportional to the initial slope of the dioxy- gen uptake curve, as given in Eq. (I): R,=(ApO',}/(MM (1) where RQ = initial dioxygen uptake rate (mol/1 s) A = maximum (initial) slope (1 O^/s) M^. = molecular weight dioxygen ( = 32 g/mol) P.J.

After completion of the dioxygen uptake measurement the amount of DPQ can be deter- mined spectrophotometrically. The resulting re- action mixture is diluted to 100 ml with toluene/methanol (13/2 v/v). This solution is diluted further (usually 50 or 100 times), so that the final absorption will be within the spectro- photometer range. The absorption maximum of DPQ is observed at 421 nm with a molar extinc- tion coefficient e of 58500 I/mol cm in toluene/methanol (13/2 v/v). The extinction coefficient was established using solutions of pure DPQ, synthesized using a literature proce- dure [31]. Beer's law is obeyed at this wave- length, so that the amount of DPQ can easily be determined. Since PPE and DPQ are practically the sole products of this reaction [32], the amount of C-0 coupled product can be calculated from the amount of DPQ and the conversion of DM P. 2.4. Rapid-freeze EPR measurements The rapid-freeze EPR experiments were per- formed by deoxygenating 25 ml of a 0.01 M copper(II) nitrate solution with 30 equivalents of Nmiz and 25 ml of a 0.02 M DMP -1-0.01 M base solution. These solutions were mixed un- der a dinitrogen atmosphere. At several time intervals samples were taken while carefully excluding dioxygen, and put in EPR tubes, which were immediately immersed in liquid dinitrogen to prevent further reaction, after which EPR spectra were measured. 2.5. Role of water The role of water (and dioxygen) was investi- gated by preparing a suspension of dehydrated CuCl; (2.54 g; 18.9 mmol) and Nmiz (3.05 ml; 3.14 g; 38.3 mmol; distilled from NaOH pellets under a dinitrogen atmosphere prior to use) in diethyl ether (25 ml). To this suspension was added a THF solution of DMP/NaODMP, pre- pared by adding sodium sand (0.865 g; 37.6 mmol) to a stirred solution of DMP (6.98 g; 57.1 mmol) in THF (125 ml). After stirring for 6 days under a dinitrogen atmosphere, NaCI was filtered off. The resulting, intensely red/bro'vn coloured filtrate was evaporated to dryness under reduced dinitrogen pressure. Yield: 10.67 g of a highly viscous, intensely red/brown coloured oil. No solid could be ob- tained, as the resulting oil could not be brought to crystallization. 2.6. X-ray data collection and structure deter- mination Crystals of the compound, [CiKNmiz).^ NO :,):,], were obtained by preparing a solution with an Nmiz to copper ratio of 10 to 1, as described in Section 2.2, but using a solvent composition of toluene/methanol of 13/2 (v/v) instead of 4/1 (v/v). After two weeks, dark blue single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were isolated. Data were col- lected on an Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 diffractome- ter with graphite monochromatized Mo-Ka 'm- diation (X = 0.71073 A). The cell dimensions were determined by 24 independent reflections. Corrections for Lorentz and polarization effects were applied. Atomic scattering factors and anomalous dispersion constants were taken from Ref [33]. For further details see Table 1. The position of the copper atom was determined from a Patterson map. The remainder of the 200 P.J.

Results 3.1. Dioxyden uptake experiments 3.I. Effect of the Nmi^. to copper ratio A very important experimental factor influ- encing the rate and selectivity of the DMP coupling reaction in the case of simple uni- and bidentate ligands has been proven to be the ratio of ligand to copper [8,10,16.35,36]. This effect has been observed before for the copperOD- Nmiz system, where a coordinating anion (chlo- ride) was used [2]. In the present study the nitrate anion is used. which has a lesser ten- dency to coordinate, in order to minimize inter- ference. For this system the Nmiz-to-copper (N/Cu) ratio was also varied. The effects on the activity (initial dioxygen uptake rate) and selectivity (PPE vs. DPQ formation) of the cou- pling reaction are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. For all N/Cu ratios 100% conver- sion of DMP was observed, except for N/Cu is 1 to 1 where only about 30% conversion was reached after 1.5 h. The amounts of DPQ as shown in Fig. 3b are not corrected for the DMP conversions, since Viersen et al. have shown that most DPQ is formed during the beginning of the reaction [36]. P.J.

It is clear from Fig. 3a and b that maximum activity and selectivity are reached only when at least a 30-fold excess of the ligand Nmiz is used. This agrees with the results found by Chen et al. for copper(II) chloride [2]. Viersen et al. found maximum activity and selectivity with copperOD chloride and the bidentate ligand /V,A/,YV',/V'-tetramethylethylenediamine at a iig- and to copper ratio of at least 5 to 1 (i.e. nitrogen-to-Cu = 10 to 1) [10]. 3.1.2. Determination of the order in Cu To determine whether the rate-limiting step of the reaction is indeed the electron-transfer (phenol oxidation) step. the order in copper was determined, at different N/Cu ratios. The base (methoxide) to copper ratio was chosen as 1 to 1 during all measurements. At each N/Cu ratio the plot of the logarithm (\"'log) of the initial dioxygen uptake rate vs. the logarithm of the copper concentration afforded a straight line, as shown for N/Cu = 37.5 in Fig. 4. The slope of this line is equal to the order in copper of the reaction. The rate constant (k) was obtained from the intercept with the v axis. The values obtained at different N/Cu ratios are listed in Table 3. Two facts are obvious from these data: (i). The order in copper is fractional and (ii). there is a distinct dependence of the order in copper on the N/Cu ratio. DMP conversions were 100% for all measurements, except for the lowest copper concentration at N/Cu = 10 to 1 and 20 to 1, where only ca. 80% conversion was achieved. DPQ percentages have not been cor- rected for the conversion. In all cases the amount of DPQ formed during the reaction was in- versely proportional to the copper concentra- tion. resulting in a dramatic increase of selectiv- ity with increasing copper concentration. Q formation was less at higher N/Cu and base/Cu ratios. At an N/Cu ratio of 37.5 to 1 the order in copper was also determined at a base-to-copper (base/Cu) ratio of 2 to 1. Also at this higher base/Cu ratio the order proved to be fractional. 1.30, slightly lower than at a base/Cu ratio of 1 to 1, where it was 1.42. The rate constant k was also somewhat lower: 0.78 's- vs. 1.31 's Table 3 Order in Cu at different Nmiz/Cu ratios at hase/Cu = Nmiz/Cu Order in Cu 0.18 0.42 1.31 10.0 20.0 37.5 75.0 1.22 1.29 1.42 1.70 9.82 '' The unit of k is strictly speaking not <\"'. but (mol/D'-s\" where A = 1 -(order in Cu).

Variation of the base to copper ratio Variation of the base/Cu ratio has been re- ported [2] to influence the activity and selectiv- ity of the coupling reaction. This study has now been expanded for our system. The activity results at an N/Cu ratio of 30 to 1 are shown in Fig. 5. At all base/Cu ratios 100% conversion of DMP was achieved, except when no base was added, because then no reaction takes place. The maximum activity is reached at a base/Cu ratio of 1.8 to 1. There is a small, approximately linear decrease in DPQ formation with increasing base/Cu ratio, from 4% DPQ formation at a base/Cu ratio of 0.2. to 2.5% DPQ at a base/Cu ratio of 4. Another effect of increasing the base/Cu ratio is found in the total reaction time. At larger base/Cu ratios (> 2 to 1) the initial reaction rate is larger than or equal to the rate at lower ratios ( s= 1 to 1 ). but the reaction takes longer to complete, i.e. to reach 100% conversion of DMP. Furthermore, at low base/Cu ratios a PPE precipitate is formed 2 when the reaction is completed, but not at the higher ratios ( > 2 to 1 ). 3.2. Spectroscopic measurements 3.2.1. Variation of the Nmiz. to copper ratio The effect of the N/Cu ratio on the composi- tion of the catalyst precursor solution was inves- tigated by performing EPR spectrometry on frozen (77 K) solutions of copperOD nitrate with increasing amounts of Nmiz. The resulting spectra are shown in Fig. 6. Obviously, there is a gradual transformation from Cu'^NO,):, into a mononuclear Cu\"(Nmiz)4 species with increasing N/Cu ra- tio. After a ratio of 4 to 1 is reached, any extra addition of ligand does not result in further changes in the EPR spectrum. The final spec- trum is very nicely resolved, showing even su- perhyperfine splitting on the lowfield Asignal, and affords the following spectral parameters: ^11=2.27 with A,;= 182 G, ߄= 11.0 G and g ^ = 2.04 with a'^ == 15.2 G. These figures are typical of an axial spectrum, as g:g ^ > 2.0 [38], and are indicative of a CuN4 chromophore. 3.2.2. Crystal structure of the catalyst precursor complex The molecular structure of the crystals ob- tained from a solution ofcopperOO nitrate with Nmi/[Cu'KNmiz^NO^J, is shown as a PLUTON [39] projection in Fig. 7. Relevant bond distances and angles are listed in Table 4. \" The number average molecular weight of the resulting poly- mer in these experiments is known to he in the order of K)-1 g/mol [21]. The actual molecular weight is controlled by the solvent composition. The more methanoi is present, the lower the molecular weight. In tact this so-called precipitation polymeriza- tion has been used as a method to prepare PPE of a well-defined molecular mass [37]. Fig. 6.

The copper atom is positioned at a center of inversion and is coordinated by four imidazole nitrogens in a slightly distorted square planar arrangement. Two of the imidazole rings lie roughly in the CuN^ plane, while the other two are more or less perpendicular to this plane. The nitrates are coordinated axially at rather long distances. The N^O; chromophore around the Cu(I I) ion is best characterized as elongated octahedral. The structure of the [Cu(Nmiz)4]:'+ cation is almost identical to those found by Clegg et al. [40] for these subunits in a number of other copper complexes. This solid-state structure is consistent with the frozen solution EPR spectrum of a mixture of copperOD nitrate with at least 4 equivalents of Nmiz (vide supra). 3.2.3. Role of dioxygen and water To study the role of dioxygen in the reaction and to obtain information about reaction inter- mediates, an experiment was conducted in which solutions of the catalyst and DMP/base were mixed while carefully excluding dioxygen. EPR spectra of frozen samples (77 K), taken at dif- ferent time intervals under rigorous exclusion of dioxygen, were ail identical to the spectrum of the catalyst solution. So, unfortunately, possible intermediate species could not be detected in this way. However, integration of the EPR sig- nals clearly shows a decrease in intensity in time, as depicted in Fig. 8 Moreover, the cop- per II) d-d absorption band in the visible region had disappeared after prolonged stirring of the catalyst and DMP/base solution in a dinitrogen atmosphere. In the freeze EPR experiment dioxygen was excluded, but water was still present. To study whether water may be essential for the reaction, an experiment was performed in which anhy- drous copper(ll) chloride. Nmiz. DMP and DMPONa were mixed while carefully excluding both dioxygen and water, from which a very Table 4 Bond distances (A) and angles ( ) around Cu tor [CuiNmi/^fNO, ),]. with estimated standard deviations in parentheses Cul-N13 2.0326(15) 031-Cul-N 13 86.27 (5) Cu]-N23 ! .9949 < i i ) 03!-OU-N23 89.38 (5) Cu 1-031 2.5945(14) N23-Cul-N13-C12 172.1604) N13-Cul-N23 89.31 (5) N13-Cui-N23-C22 94.50(13) N13-Cul-N13a 180.0(5) 204 P.J.

Starting with copperOl) and externally added base results in the formation of very active catalysts, especially when the base is added to the DMP solution instead of to the catalyst solution [104]. Also, shorter initiation times have been observed. Furthermore, the amount of base used can be controlled better when using copperOl). Therefore, in the present study copperOl) complexes were used. intensely coloured, viscous oil resulted. LJV/Vis performed on a THF solution of this oil showed the presence of a d-d transition and a very broad, intense charge transfer band. The charge transfer band is attributed to the copperOO-phe- nolate MLCT [41]. This solution is stable for prolonged periods of time when stored under a dry dinitrogen atmosphere. Addition of a few drops of water to this solution resulted in an almost immediate disappearance of the intense charge transfer colour, and eventually in the complete decolourization of the solution, prov- ing that some water is required for the oxidation step. After some more minutes a yellow colour indicative of DPQ appeared. 4. Discussion 4.1. General Originally, because copper(II) salts were found to form rather inactive catalysts, mostly copperO) salts were used [1]. However, these catalysts were not really copperO) species, as their solutions were *pre-oxygenated' by stirring these in a dioxygen atmosphere [42.43], which resulted in the oxidation of copperO) to copperOl) and also in the in situ formation of a basic species as the product of the dioxygen reduction. This latter effect has long been over- looked. The implicit base formation results in 4.2. Effect of the Nmi^. to copper ratio It is clear from the kinetic experiments that the maximum activity and selectivity are reached only when an N/Cu ratio of at least 30 to 1 is employed. The EPR measurements on the other hand show that already at a ratio of 4 to 1 virtually all copperOl) is converted into [Cu(NiTiiz)4(NO-();,], which, therefore, must be the catalyst precursor species. Obviously, the excess ligand must play some other, significant role during the reaction. This role could be related to shifting some (pre-)equilibrium (or equilibria) to a more favourable position, and thereby influencing the reaction rate and PPE formation. Furthermore, there is a distinct effect of the N/Cu ratio on the order in copper of the reac- tion. A fractional order in copper is observed for all N/Cu ratios, which indicates that at least two competing rate-limiting steps are operative, the rates of which are of the same order of magnitude. One of these steps is probably the actual phenol oxidation, up till now seen as the only rate-limiting step, which has an order in (dinuclear) copper of one. The other rate-de- termining step must therefore be the formation of a dinuclear copperOl) species, since this is the only step in the mechanism that would result in an order in copper of 2 if it were the sole rate-determining step. As neither step is com- pletely rate-determining, a fractional order is observed and it would be expected that chang- P.J. if\\iiiti cl cil. / Journal iifMtilt'ciiiiir Catalysis A: Chcminil IIOHW 195-210 ing any factor favouring (or disfavouring) either one of these steps will result in a change in the order in copper of the reaction. This appears to be the case for the N/Cu ratio, as at higher ratios a higher order in copper is observed. indicating that the formation of dinuclear copper species becomes the slower step. This observa- tion nicely correlates with the effect that in- creasing the N/Cu ratio has on reaction (3), where it shifts this equilibrium to the side of the mononuclear species. Therefore the dinucie- arization step is hampered, resulting in a higher order in copper, as was indeed found with higher N/Cu ratios (see Table 3). Increasing the base/Cu ratio at a constant N/Cu ratio resulted in a lower order in copper, which is easily explained because increasing the amount of base will increase the amount of potentially bridging anions in solution, \"hereby making the forma- tion of dinuclear species easier.

The observed fractional order in copper, implies the formation of a dinuclear copper(II) species during a 'rateimiting' step. This is in fact the first direct evidence for the more recent mechanistic proposals, which incorporate such dinuclear complexes [22,26.45]. The dramatic increase in selectivity of the reaction with increasing copper concentration is a trend which is observed for all N/Cu ratios, and also for other catalytic systems [361. This may be explained as follows: the equilibrium constant for reaction (3) is defined as: K= [Cu^/ICu]2. This value is constant for any given copper concentration. This means that the ratio [Cu^]/[Cu] is not constant. With increas- (3) ing copper concentration, the amount of dinu- clear species will be increased relative to the amount of mononuclear species. Since mononu- clear species will yield preferentially DPQ by a I-electron transfer mechanism [36]. increasing the copper concentration gives rise to less DPQ formation. 4.3. Effect of the base to copper ratio It appears that the optimal base/Cu ratio for a maximum initial reaction rate is about 1.8 to 1. Also. at higher ratios a slightly improved selectivity is found. Moreover, some other ef- fects on the reaction are observed. At higher base/Cu ratios ( > 2 to 1 ) no PPE precipitate has been formed when the reaction is com- pleted, which is indicative of a lower degree of polymerization- This is due to the higher num- ber of phenolate end groups in correspondence to the higher amount of base. Since the starting amount of DMP was the same in all these reactions, it is evident that with increasing base concentration, the polymerization degree will be lower as there will be more. shorter chains at the end of the experiment. Even though the initial dioxygen uptake rate may be higher at higher base/Cu ratios, it takes longer for the reaction to complete. No clear explanation can be given yet for this effect, but it may be envisioned that at higher base/Cu ratios the (slower) coupling of PPE chains will begin earlier in the reaction, since there will be more. shorter chains as compared to the situa- tion at lower ratios. Another possibility is poi- soning of the copper catalyst by hydroxide due to the combination of excess base and the for- mation of water during the reaction, resulting in inactive copper hydroxide species. 4.4. Role of tlioxygen and waler Rapid-freezc EPR measurements were per- formed in order to gain insight into the nature of intermediate copper species. Only the signal of 206 P.J. Baesjoii et cil. /Jaw-mil of Molecular Ciitniysi.f A: Chemical 110 ViW6> 195-210 [Cu(Nmiz)4(NO;,)2], the catalyst precursor com- plex, is observed in the EPR spectra. Under anaerobic conditions a significant decrease in the intensity of the signal of this precursor complex is observed, as shown in Fig. 8. This decrease may be due either to the formation of an EPR-silent dinuclear copper(II) complex, or to the reduction of copperOD to copper(I). EPR cannot distinguish between these possibilities, but visible spectroscopy can, because if a dinu- clear copper(il) species would be formed, a d-d transition band should still be observed in the visible spectrum. The spectrum of the resulting solution after several hours of stirring under a dinitrogen atmosphere does not show such a peak. However, shaking the solution with air results in a complete return of the d-d band in the visible spectrum, as compared to the spec- trum of the initial copper solution. Therefore, it is concluded that all copper(II) present at the beginning of the experiment has been reduced to copperd). This implies that even in the ab- sence of dioxygen, the first reaction steps, in- cluding the phenol oxidation step, still occur. The reaction stops of course when all copper has been reduced to copper(l). It is clear that dioxygen is only required as a terminal oxidant for the reoxidation of the copperO) species, so that the catalytic cycle can be closed. The role of water in the reaction was studied by performing an experiment in which all reac- tants were mixed in THF while rigorously ex- cluding both dioxygen and water. The resulting intensely coloured solution was stable for pro- longed periods of time when stored under a dry dinitrogen atmosphere. UV/Vis spectroscopy confirmed the presence ofcopper(II) and showed the presence of an intense charge transfer band, identified as a copper(II)-phenolate MLCT [41], indicating that a coppei<II)-phenoxo species was present in solution. Addition of water to this solution resulted an immediate decolouriza- tion and formation of DPQ. Apparently some water is essential for the actual phenol oxidation step to take place, most probably by forming the reactive intermediate. 4.5. Mechanistic implications Up till now, even the most recent mechanistic proposals in literature [22,26,45], as discussed in the introduction (vide supra), are still not completely satisfactory. The evident need for an excess of the ligand is not explained, and nei- ther is the necessity of some water in the begin- ning of the reaction. In view of the results presented in this paper, a more realistic mecha- nism will be discussed. In the present study it has been shown that dinuclear copper species play a key role in the catalytic process, as concluded from the frac- tional order in copper and the dependence of this order on the N/Cu ratio. Furthermore it has been shown that a little water is needed at the start of the reaction to make the actual phenol oxidation possible. This indicates that it is very unlikely that the dinuclear bis-phenoxo bridged copper(II), as proposed in earlier literature mechanisms, is the catalytically active interme- diate, but rather is either unreactive or slowly decomposes to form DPQ. In fact the possibility of such a reaction has been suggested from experiments performed by Kitajima et al. with copper pyrazole complexes [46]. It is highly unlikely that in such a bis-phenoxo bridged complex a two-electron transfer with only one of the phenolates will occur. If one of the phenolates has been oxidized to the correspond- ing radical, for reasons of symmetry it would seem much more likely that the other phenolate is also oxidized than to oxidize the radical once again to form a phenoxonium cation, even if one of the phenolate ions is a monomer and the other an oligomer, which is more easily oxi- dized because of the presence of an electron donating /wu-phenoxy substituent. Therefore, the most likely candidate for the actual catalyti- cally active species is an asymmetric dinuclear copperOD species containing one bridging phe- nolate and another bridging ligand, such as hy- droxide or chloride. Since the experiment where water was excluded was performed with copperOD chloride resulted in a stable complex. P.J. Bciexjmi et ul. / Joiinwl of Mole ctiltir Catalysis A : Chemical il0(!996> 195-210 207 hydroxide is the most probable activating species. This would explain why some water is required to start the reaction: i.e. to form the catalytically active species. Hydroxide may be formed if a little water is present because of the Lewis acidic properties of the copperOl) ion or in the presence of base, according to reaction (4): DMPO - + H ^O ^ DMPOH + OH - (4) Since hydroxide is the stronger base, equilib- rium (4) lies to the left, but nevertheless a small (catalytic) amount of hydroxide will be present. Note that during a normal dioxygen uptake experiment sodium methoxide was used as a base (see the Experimental section). The methoxide anion might also be a candidate for a bridging anion in the catalytically active species. However, since methoxide is a very strong base it will be completely protonated in the presence of excess water and phenol, therefore methoxide is not considered here. An excess of the ligand will influence the nature of the mononuclear copper species, as shown in equilibria (5), that will be shifted to the left upon increasing the N/Cu ratio.

Kursjtiii rt til. / Ji'iiriicil iif Miilt-niUir Ctihilysi^ ,\\: Clu'mu'ul HOIiWfil IV5-210 Two effects of increasing the N/Cu ratio can now be distinguished: (i) the amount of mononuclear copperOI) phenoxo or hydroxo species will decrease; (ii) the amount of non-co- ordinated (free) hydroxide and especially pheno- late in solution will increase. However, as phe- nolate and hydroxide are both strongly coordi- nating anions, one can still expect coordination to copper, even at a high N/Cu ratio. The first effect will hinder the formation of dinuclear hydroxo or phenoxo bridged copper species by decreasing the amount of monomeric copper compounds suitable for forming dinu- clear species. Furthermore, the actual dinucle- arization itself is also hampered, according to equilibrium (3), which is shifted to the left (mononuclear species) upon increasing the N/Cu ratio. Thus, the formation of any dinu- clear copper species will be severely hampered by an increasing N/Cu ratio. However, if the catalytically active dinuclear copper species, supposedly the (|JL-hydroxo)(|JL-phenoxo)- bridged one, is formed, the irreversible double one-electron transfer will occur, und the equilib- ria will be driven to the right lor this species. Other species, like the suppo-edly unreactive bis-phenoxo bridged or the bis-hydroxo bridged one, will hardly be formed at a high N/Cu ratio. Thus, the net effect of a high N/Cu ratio is positive as far as reaction rate and selectivity are concerned, because more copper ions are available for the catalytic process as they are not bound in inactive or DPQ-forming species (vide infra). It is noted that bis-hydroxo bridged dinuclear copper species may be formed espe- cially near the end of the reaction, as the in- creasing amount of water will shift equilibrium (4) to the right thereby forming hydroxide ions. Indeed it was observed that at a low N/Cu ratio (1 to 1) complete conversion of DMP could not be reached. The second effect, the occurrence of free basic species in solution, especially phenolate, may also play a positive role. In the catalytic cycle a phenoxonium cation is formed after the phenol oxidation step. This cation may be at- tacked by either a phenol or a phenolate. Be- cause of the negative charge, a free phenolate is the most active species for this coupling step. Since phenolate will be liberated from the cop- per complexes in the case of an excess of the ligand the reaction will be accelerated. After attack of the phenolate on the cation a neutral molecule is formed that will give the dimer phenol after tautomerization. These novel mechanistic insights have been summarized in Fig. 9, where a new reaction mechanism is proposed employing all (pre-)equilibria discussed above. In this modified mechanism, the supposedly catalytically active intermediate (p,- hydroxo)(|JL-phenoxo)-dicopper(H) is formed eventually in one of the rate-determining steps (rdsl). This species may then undergo a second rate-determining step (rds2) as the bridging phe- nolate is oxidized to the corresponding phenox- onium cation. This new species may then be attacked by a free phenolate. Two possibilities exist, the probabilities of which are dependent on the charge distribution on the phenolate. Formation of a bisphenol may occur by C-C coupling if both the anion and cation are monomers. The bisphenol can than be oxidized to DPQ. C-0 coupling of the anion and cation. which has a much higher probability and which can also occur between oligomeric species, will afford a, possibly coordinated, quinone ether. After tautomerization the dimer phenol may be replaced by a monomeric phenolate, or may remain coordinated after deprotonation. Reoxi- dation of the copperO) ions may proceed via a peroxo-bridged dicopper(II) complex [47]. Such reactions are known to be extremely fast. At this point the growing phenolic chain may be displaced by a monomeric phenolate, or remain coordinated to the copper and undergo another cycle. Two aspects of the reaction need to be stud- ied in more detail. Firstly it must become clear why maximal activity is found at a base/Cu ratio of about 1.8 to 1. Possibly the equilibria discussed above are shifted somewhat to a more P.J. Btiesjtw cl ni./ Journal of Molecular Ciiuilyna A: Clit'ininil HOUW6) IV5-2iu 209 favourable position, in terms of reaction rate and selectivity. Two effects might be distin- guished: (i) the formation of the undesired bis- (x-phenoxo bridged dinuclear copper species will be stimulated, but (ii) more free phenolate is present in solution which is positive for the actual phenol coupling step. Apparently at a base/Cu ratio of about 1.8 to 1 an optimum is found between these two opposed effects, as far as reaction rate is concerned. Secondly, the Michaelis-Menten kinetics ob- served for the copper(IO chloride-Nmiz system [2] needs further attention. It is possible that a phenol will be hydrogen bonded to the (bridg- ing) phenolate prior to the rate-limiting step, or that a DMP molecule is coordinated terminally to one or both copper ions. it is even possible that for this copper(ll) nitrate system Michaelis-Menten kinetics does not apply. This is subject of a further investigation. 5. Conclusions A detailed study of the copperOD nitrate/./V- methylimidazole catalyst in the oxidative cou- pling of 2.6-dimethylphenol. by means of ki- netic and spectroscopic measurements, has pro- vided important new insights into the reaction mechanism. The order of the reaction in copper was found to be fractional and dependent on The N/Cu ratio, indicative that in this system at least two competing rate-limiting steps are oper- ative. One of these is likely to be the actual phenol oxidation step, that has up till now al- ways been seen as the sole rate-limiting step. Because of the observed fractional order in copper the other rate-limiting step must be the formation of a dinuclear copper(II) species. The formation of these dinuclear complexes are hampered by an excess of the ligand Nmiz. and indeed i\\n increase in the order in copper was observed with increasing N/Cu ratio. Also the importance of a dinuclear copper species as a key intermediate in the oxidative coupling reac- tion has been demonstrated. Variation of base/Cu ratio showed that max- imum activity was reached at a ratio of about 1.8 to 1. The selectivity (PPE vs. DPQ forma- tion) was found to increase slightly with in- creasing base/Cu ratio. The solid-state structure of the catalyst pre- cursor complex has been determined and proved to be [Cu\"(Nmiz)^(N03),J, an axially elongated octahedron where the Nmiz molecules are coor- dinated equatorially and the nitrates axially. This structure was found to be consistent with the (frozen) solution structure of the compound as determined by EPR spectroscopy. It has been conclusively shown that dioxygen is not essential for the phenol oxidation step to occur. Dioxygen is only needed for the reoxida- tion ofcopperO) to copper(II), and the regenera- tion of base by formation of hydroxide. On the other hand water was found to be essential for the oxidation step to take place. In the new proposal for a reaction mechanism the need for water is explained in terms of the nature of the key catalytic intermediate: this is not a bis-jx- phenoxo bridged dinuclear copper species which is thought to be either unreactive, or forming DPQ, but rather a (|JL-phenoxo)(|JL-hydroxo)di- copperOt) species. Water is then needed to form a (catalytic) amount of hydroxide according to reaction (4). The maximum reaction rate and maximum selectivity for polymer formation are reached at an N/Cu ratio of at least 30 to 1. On the other hand ail copper nitrate is converted into the catalyst precursor species already at an N/Cu ratio of 4 to 1. The necessity for the excess ligand is explained in terms of the effects it has on the nature of the copper species by influenc- ing a number of pre-equilibria, as shown in the new mechanistic proposal in Fig. 9.

The complex of copper(II) nitrate with N-methylimidazole (Nmiz) ligand has been studied as a catalyst for the oxidative coupling of 2,6-dimethylphenol by means of kinetic and spectroscopic measurements. The order of the reaction in copper is fractional and depends on the N Cu ratio and the base/Cu ratio, indicating that there are at least two possible rate-determining steps, i.e. the formation of a dinuclear copper species and the phenol oxidation. EPR spectroscopy performed on frozen solutions with varying ligand to copper ratios shows that all Cu(II) is converted into the precursor complex at a ratio of 4 to 1, whereas in kinetic experiments, maximum activity and selectivity are reached only at a ratio of at least 30 to 1. Base is needed as a co-catalyst, and the maximum reaction rate is reached at a base to copper ratio of 1.8 to 1. The solid-state X-ray structure of the catalyst precursor complex has been determined to be [Cu(Nmiz)4(NO3)2], monoclinic, space group P 21 n , a = 8.452(1) Å, b = 10.376(2) A ̊ , c = 12.821(2) A ̊ , β = 94.88(2) °, Z = 1, R = 0.049 for 3525 reflections. This structure consists of an axially elongated octahedral CuN4O2 chromophore, which is in agreement with frozen-solution EPR spectra. Investigations under conditions where water and dioxygen were carefully excluded, have shown that for the phenol oxidation step the presence of dioxygen is not required. However, the reaction does require a trace of water (or hydroxide) to form the reactive intermediate. A modified reaction mechanism for the oxidative coupling is presented with special attention to the first steps of the reaction and the equilibrium species present in solution. The role of dioxygen appears to be only to reoxidize the formed Cu(I) species and to regenerate base.
