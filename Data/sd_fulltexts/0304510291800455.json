M. Deshpande, S. S. Divekar, R. V. Gholap and R. V. Chaudhari** Chemical Engineering Division, National Chemical Laboratory, Pune 411 008 (India) (Received October 1, 1990; accepted January 16, 1991) Abstract Deactivation of HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 catalyst in the hydroformylation of 1-hexene has been investigated. The catalyst was found to be deactivated at higher temperatures. Addition of excess triphenylphosphine was found to delay deactivation, which, however could not be prevented entirely. The effect of solvents on the deactivation was also studied. Introduction Hydroformylation of olefins is important in the manufacture of a wide range of aldehydes and alcohols [ 1 ]. In the low pressure process, HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 complex catalyst is used in a homogeneous state. Under certain conditions, this catalyst is deactivated due to decomposition and formation of inactive species by interaction with the substrate [2-5]. Although the product distribution, selectivity and kinetics of hydroformylation of olefins have been studied previously using HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 catalyst, the deactivation of this catalyst has not been studied in detail. Also, in general, the deactivation phenomenon in homogeneous catalysis has not been studied in as much details as in the case of heterogeneous catalysis. The aim of this work was to experimentally demonstrate the deactivation of HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 catalyst in the hydroformylation of 1-hexene. Particularly, the effect of temperature, ligand (PPh3) concentration and solvents on the deactivation has been studied. Experimental The reactions were carried out in a stirred reactor of 300 ml capacity. The details regarding experimental procedure followed are identical to those reported in our earlier work [6]. The details concerning the reagents and catalyst have also been reported earlier [6]. *NCL Communication No. 5001. **Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/91/$3.50 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 334 50 w z w 401 x w 0 z 30~ 0 h w z 201 0 U Z U 10 Q W a - I I I 150 C ssz5 c 0 100 C _0 4 8 12 16 20 TIME,min Fig. 1.

It was observed that with increasing temperature the conversion of 1hexene decreased significantly but the rate of hydroformylation was enhanced. At 100 C, 82% conversion was obtained, whereas at a temperature of 125 C, the maximum conversion achieved was 31% (see Wig. 1). At 150 C the maximum conversion obtained was even lower (17%). This clearly shows deactivation of the catalyst at higher temperatures. A similar observation has been reported previously [9, 10]. With increasing temperature, the n/ iso ratio was found to decrease, although the overall aldehyde selectivity was not affected. As in the previous work, two types of inactive Rh species are likely to be formed. Abatjoglou and Bryant (3) have reported formation of dimeric phosphido-bridged clusters (I), which are inactive to hydroformylation as well as hydrogenation. Wilkinson has observed formation of a brown complex (II) containing Rh bound to carbon of phosphine (PPh3). An inactive Rh dimer is also reported to be formed under hydroformylation conditions [2]. ~ Rh -CO PPh3 335 Results and discussion In several experiments, it was observed that the reaction stopped before achieving complete conversion of the olefin, indicating deactivation of the catalyst. The results at different conditions are discussed below. The main products observed in the hydroformylation of 1-hexene were found to be n-heptaldehyde and 2-methylhexaldehyde, as reported previously [6]. Although hydrogenation of 1-hexene at higher temperatures is expected, no hexane was observed among the products in the range of conditions studied in this work. The amount of aldehyde products formed was found to be proportional to CO, H2 and 1-hexene consumed, indicating a high selectivity to aldehydes. In order to understand the deactivation behaviour of the catalyst, in each experiment, data on (CO+H2) consumed versus time were obtained. At the end of each experiment, concentrations of the liquid phase reactants and products were also determined. Effect of temperature The effect of temperature on the maximum conversion and selectivity in the hydroformylation of 1-hexene was studied at temperatures of 100, 125 and 150 C, (CO+H2) pressure of 27.21, atm. CO to H2 ratio of 1:1 and initial catalyst and olefin concentrations of 5.45 X 10-' and 7.97 X 10-' mol cm-3, respectively. The results are presented in Table 1. At higher temperatures, the formation of phosphido-bridged Rh complexes is likely to occur, leading to a drop in the activity of the catalyst (Table 1). This effect is expected to be more pronounced with increasing temperatures. It was noted that the catalyst was active in the beginning of the reaction, but later, after several cycles, a decrease in activity was observed indicating deactivation. In order to understand the nature of catalyst deactivation, the catalyst HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 was heated to 150 C, under P(CO) and P(H)=13.68 atm, in the absence of olefin for 15 min. This catalyst was then tested for hydroformylation activity at 80 C. No conversion of CO/H2 or 1-hexene was observed in this experiment, clearly indicating deactivation of the catalyst due to heating at 150 C. A possible mechanism of formation of species (I) leading to catalyst deactivation is shown below [3].

The formation of species II and the dimer [2] is unlikely under the conditions investigated in this work [7]. According to the mechanism in Scheme 1, the coordinatively unsaturated Rh species (A) will undergo cleavage of the P-C bond of phosphine and form phosphido complex (I). At higher temperatures, the predominance of the dissociative mechanism of hydroformylation over the associative mechanism is known to occur [9]. Since the active catalytic species is coordinatively less saturated, it is even more likely to undergo reaction according to Scheme 1 at higher temperatures, causing rapid deactivation. Effect of phosphine concentration The effect of phosphine concentration was investigated at 100 and 125 C at P(CO) -P(H) -13.6 atm and catalyst and olefin concentrations of 5.45 X 10-' and 7.97 X 10-', mol cm-3 respectively. The results are presented in Table 2. The maximum conversion achieved at 100 C was found to be ^- 80-85%. It was observed that increasing the phosphine concentration increases the rate of reaction at 100 C, as shown in Fig. 2. At higher temperature (125 C, Fig. 3), although the initial rate of reaction increases, the catalyst was found to be deactivated in a short time. Addition of phosphine is found to prolong the hydroformylation activity of the catalyst. Above a ratio of 1:4, this effect is found to be negligible. Higher phosphine concentration is likely to inhibit further dissociation of HRh(CO)(PPh3)2, thus preventing formation of phosphido complexes and retarding deactivation.

Effect of solvent Since severe deactivation was observed in the hydroformylation of 1hexene at higher temperatures in benzene as a solvent, the effect of other solvents on the deactivation pattern was also studied at 125 C. The results are presented in Fig. 4. It was observed that, while in benzene solvent the maximum conversion achieved was - 31% (at 11 min), in butyraldehyde and 338 n-heptanol it increased to 52 and 64% respectively (at 11 min). In addition to the enhancement in activity, the life of the catalyst was also increased. The maximum conversion obtained in butyraldehyde solvent was 52% whereas with n-heptanol it was 77%. No side products were observed in any of the reactions studied. Conclusions The hydroformylation catalyst HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 was found to be deactivated at higher temperatures in the hydroformylation of 1-hexene. Excess phosphine was found to retard deactivation, which, however could not be prevented. Solvents were also found to play an important role in the deactivation of the catalyst. Further investigations on the role of excess triphenylphosphine and solvents in prolonging the activity of the catalyst are in progress. References 1 B. Comils, in J.
