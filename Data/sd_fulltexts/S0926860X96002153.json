Two different types of plasma are used in this field: low temperature plasma (low pressure plasma) and high temperature plasma. The first type of plasma technique is widely used for the modification of surface oxides, and for the preparation and regeneration of catalysts as well as for catalytic synthesis and decomposition. The second type is applied for the preparation of ceramic-based supports, recovery of precious metals from used catalysts, and catalytic reactions. Both oxides and supported metal catalysts have been prepared by this method. The catalytic reactions involving the plasma technique essentially involve NO, methane or ammonia as reactants. An interesting potential for this technique is its application in the recovery of the precious metals from car exhaust catalysts.

Introduction A plasma is composed of highly excited atomic, molecular, ionic and radical species. It might be regarded as a fourth state of matter. The plasma state is generated by the ionization process that takes place when a sufficient amount of energy is supplied to a gas. The process of gas ionization occurs due to collision of ingoing molecules with electrons and by absorption of electromagnetic radiation. The reactivity of the obtained species will depend on the type of plasma source and the gas used. Two principal ways of plasma generation can be distinguished. A cold gas plasma, known as a glow discharge plasma, is obtained at low pressure and low temperature. This type of plasma is widely used in surface modification. A thermal plasma, or an arc jet plasma, is produced under atmospheric pressure at high temperature. Choice of plasma process for a given application is dictated by the desired final result. In many technological applications the state of the surface of the materials used in the process determines the outcome. Plasma is a very helpful technique where surface chemical modification is required. Plasma treatment is surface specific, hence it can be employed to modify surfaces without affecting the characteristics of the bulk. Consequently, plasma processes have found a wide range of very important technological applications for modifications of surface energetics to improve adhesion strength, cleaning, coating, biocompatibility to mention a few. The surface of a catalyst takes a particular place among the surfaces with specific requirements. For reasons of economy and environmental concern, catalytic processes require continuous improvements. Such improvements may be achieved in different ways. One way is to find out new modes for the preparation of catalytic materials that promote the desired reactions. Another M. Boutonnet Kizling, S.G. Jiir&s /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 1-21 3 one is improvement of the output of the reactions by modifying other factors than the catalyst. The plasma technique may be beneficial in both cases. The plasma processes have successfully been applied to two different areas in the field of catalysis; firstly in the preparation and regeneration of catalysts. Secondly, the plasma process was used to directly excite the reactants. It is also interesting to consider industrial problems that are closely related to those encountered in catalysis and in which plasma processes may simplify the procedure for overcoming them. Plasma techniques are finding increasing and varying applications in cataly- sis. In Table 3, 29 patents on this subject are compiled; these testify to the interest in the commercial application of plasma within the field of catalysis. The purpose of this short review is to draw attention to these developments during the last 15 years. We further discuss the use of plasma techniques in the preparation of catalysts and catalytic reactions. 2. The different plasma techniques There are in principle two kinds of plasmas [ 1]. The low temperature plasma that is known as a cold gas or glow discharge plasma. The other one is a high temperature plasma. They are both mainly used as gaseous plasmas. It should be mentioned that corona and ozone generator dischargers are hybrid plasmas, thus lying between cold and thermal plasmas. However, it is possible to sustain the plasma state in liquids as well. 2.1. The gaseous plasma techniques In the plasma state, a gas is constantly ionized providing neutral atoms, positive and negative ions, and free electrons. It includes reactive neutral species as well. As the components formed during the ionization recombine, photons of ultra-violet and visible radiation are released emitting a faint blue glow. The cold gas plasma is created when a gas at low pressure is exposed to an electromagnetic field within radio or microwave frequencies [2]. There is direct correlation between excitation frequency and plasma reactivity. Nevertheless, it seems that a 13.56 MHz radio frequency source is preferentially used. In a cold gas plasma neutral molecules and gaseous ions have temperature ranges between ambient and a few hundred degrees. The electrons, on the other hand, have energies corresponding to high temperature values. Thus, the system is not under thermal equilibrium conditions. As a cold gas plasma is a vacuum process it has to be created in an isolated space. The main components of the experimental equipment used for cold gas plasma are the following: a vacuum chamber, a system to evacuate the chamber, a gas introduction device, and an excitation source producing electromagnetic radiation within radio frequencies 4 M. Boutonnet Kizling, S.G. Jiir~ts/Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 1-21 for initiating and sustaining plasma. The construction materials are glass, quartz or aluminum. The process variables are the radio frequency power, gas, process pressure and process time. Commercial plasma processing equipments consist of similar components but there are variations in operating parameters depending on the design. The low temperature plasma is specially suitable for surface modification, the most common application being sputtering of surfaces. This plasma has also found a direct application in the catalytic reactions and the catalyst preparation. Thermal plasmas are produced by gas arcs under atmospheric pressure in the 1-4.104 K region. The energy distribution of the gas molecules, ions and electrons in the thermal plasma indicates that the system is in thermal equilib- rium. The high temperature plasma can be used for the synthesis of materials such as ceramics. Process parameters of the low pressure and the atmospheric plasmas are listed in Table 1. 2.2. The electrical condensation method The plasma state can be also created in liquids. A pulsed high-frequency ac spark-discharge can be used to obtain reactive species in inert liquids such as hydrocarbons. Svedberg described the formation of metal particle dispersions by the condensation method as early as in 1922 [3]. The electrical condensation method uses an oscillatory circuit according to the Svedberg design, that is, a pulsed high frequency ac spark-discharge. The electrodes are made of the metal to be dispersed. The high frequency current causes the formation of atomic metal vapor that condenses giving highly dispersed metal particles in organic media [4]. 3. Applications 3.1. Preparation and regeneration of catalysts 3.1.1. Electrical condensation method 3.1.1.1. Metal sols. Tiny narrowly size-distributed particles are of interest in many fields of technology such as ceramics, catalysis, and polymers. Suspen- sions of catalytically active metal particles with a narrow size distribution are attractive specially when they are used as a catalyst for structure-sensitive reactions. Of special interest in this context is the possibility for preparing metal particles in the absence of a support, thus avoiding the influence of the support on the formation of the particles. M.

Apparatus for the preparation of plasma catalysts. After Rouleau et al. [6]. Lunina and Novozhilov [4] have prepared sols of different metals in organic media using the electrical condensation method described previously. Reaction conditions were: current strength less than 1 A, effective voltage 600 V and a frequency of 800-900 kHz. Thus, suspensions of particles of Ag, A1, Bi, Cd, Cu, Mo, Fe, Ni, Zr, Pt, Sb, Sn and Co were prepared in alcohols, acetone, ethyl acetate and in hydrocarbons. Korenev and Lunina [5] also prepared a highly dispersed Fe sol with a metal concentration as high as 2 wt.-% in organic media containing some stabilizers such as aluminum stearate. 3.1.1.2. Metal particles on support. The electric condensation method appears to be suitable for preparing supported catalysts. Rouleau et al. [6] have recently used a method similar to the one of Lunina and Novozhilov (see Section 3.1.1.1) to prepare Ni based catalyst for hydrotreating vacuum resids. The formation of Ni particles by evaporation of Ni metal takes place simultaneously with the formation of the carbon support that is formed by pyrolysis of a hydrocarbon in order to trap Ni particles. The apparatus used for the preparation of these catalysts is shown in Fig. 1. The conditions for the preparation were: a voltage of 20 kV and a current lower than 3 mA. The electrodes were made of nickel and immersed in a light hydrocarbon. The resulting catalyst consisted of Ni particles deposited on a carbonaceous substance that resulted from the pyrolysis of the hydrocarbon. The mean size of the obtained Ni metal particles was 35 nm with a wide size distribution. Metal content was 19.5 wt.-%. It was shown that sulfidation does not influence the dispersion of Ni metal on the carbon support. This result is an important one in connection with the application of these catalysts to the hydroconversion of deasphalted vacuum residue where hydrogen sulfide is always present in the feed. The Ni catalysts prepared by the electric M. Boutonnet Kizling, S.G. Jiirgts / Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 1-21 7 condensation method have shown a notable activity at low catalyst to charge ratio. This mode of preparation was original in that the metal particles as well as the support material were obtained simultaneously, the latter having as precursor the solvent used in the process. 3.1.2. Gaseous plasma techniques 3.1.2.1. Catalyst preparation. As mentioned previously, the plasma technique provides the possibility for forming catalysts in the gas phase. Several authors have used this method of preparation to obtain supported catalysts for various applications. Vissokov and co-workers [7-9] used an electric arc low-tempera- ture plasma in the preparation of catalysts for ammonia synthesis. These catalysts consisted of a mixture of several oxides such as Fe304, Fe203, FeO, AI203, K20, CaO, SiO2, MgO at various concentrations. The precursors of the catalysts were metal oxides, hydroxides, carbonates or nitrates. The electric power used during the reaction was 15 kW and the carrier gas was argon, nitrogen, oxygen or air depending on the type of catalyst to be prepared. The particles prepared under such conditions had an average size of 50 nm, and X-ray analysis showed a more compact crystal lattice than that of particles prepared using a conventional method. The value of the crystal lattice parameter had decreased by 0.9%. Thus, as Vissokov has shown several types of oxides, nitrides and metal particles can be synthesized in large amounts using a low-temperature plasma process instead of the classical condenser methods. A more basic study of the preparation of a supported Ru catalyst using the cold gas plasma has been carried out by Halverson and Cocke [10]. Using a mixture of oxygen and water as plasma gas they prepared an aluminum oxide support from a pure metal substrate. The conditions of the reaction were the following: radio frequency 13.56 MHz and a power of 100 W; the temperature was varied between 125 and 575. By impregnation of the obtained alumina with an aqueous solution of ruthenium chloride followed by an oxidation-reduc- tion treatment the Ru/AI203 catalysts were prepared. Highly dispersed metallic particles as well as large metal aggregates are produced under such conditions. They were used as models for bulk ruthenium catalysts. Khan and Frey [11] prepared perovskite oxides as LaMOx films (where M is Co, Mn or Ni) deposited on alumina by a plasma spray deposition technique. They compared the structural and catalytic properties of the LaNiOx and LaCoO, perovskite oxides obtained by plasma. They related the differences in their catalytic activities to the different electronic structures of the surfaces of these two perovskites. The plasma spray technique has been used by Subramanian et al. [ 12] in order to prepare Raney nickel electrodes. The preparation included plasma spraying of Ni and A1 alloys on a stainless steel sheet and elimination of the aluminum metal. Raney nickel electrodes were thus obtained. Comparison of the properties 8 M. Boutonnet Kizling, S.G. Jiir&s/Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 1-21 in the hydrogen evolution reaction on the Ni electrodes prepared by plasma with those of electrodes prepared by electroplating, for example, showed that the first one exhibited a lower overvoltage and better stability. The influence of a low temperature plasma treatment on the surface properties of a WO3/SiO2 catalyst has been studied by Blecha et al. [13]. The activation of the catalyst by a nitrogen plasma changes its catalytic properties in the reaction of propene disproportionation (metathesis) compared with those of a catalyst activated by heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere. Comparison of the properties of these different catalysts shows that the plasma-activated catalyst is more active and more selective towards ethylene formation. The arc plasma method has been used to prepare ultrafine SiC powder with 13-structure. These particles showed good efficiency as photocatalysts in water decomposition [14]. The preparation of bifunctional zeolite catalysts can be 2+ in carried out using a low temperature plasma to decompose Pt(NH3) 4 mordenite [15]. The low temperature plasma calcination of NH4, Na-Y zeolites permits the removal of NH3 in order to give Brfinsted acid sites but causes at the same time a severe loss of crystallinity [16]; this is not surprising in view of the residual Na content still present in them. The modes of preparation of supported catalysts using plasma and described in Section 3.1.2 are presented in Table 2. References to the patents given in this field have been assembled in Table 3. The works described previously show that plasma techniques can be success- fully applied to the preparation of metal particles on support and also of various oxides such as silica, alumina and perovskites to be used as supports. For these purposes, either high temperature or cold plasmas were employed depending on the nature of the material to be prepared. 3.1.2.2. Regeneration and sputtering of catalyst. The argon low temperature plasma is usually employed to clean up, that is to sputter, solid surfaces before analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. By applying this procedure repeatedly, it is possible to remove the uppermost surface region layer by layer. Thus, the argon low temperature plasma can also be used for regeneration of catalysts when the deactivation is due to formation of carbonaceous deposits, that is coke, on the active part of a metallic catalyst. It is commonly known that coke is the main cause of catalyst deactivation. These carbonaceous deposits in the case of metal-supported catalysts, for example, are usually removed from the surface of the catalysts by heat treatment following by an oxidation-reduction treatment. Maeson et al. [17] investigated the oxidative removal of tetrapropylammonium and diethylamine species from zeolites using low-temperature oxygen plasma. The effect depends upon the chemistry and dimensions of the zeolite framework as well as on the removed molecule. Thus, the N-containing molecules could be removed from channels at the depth of 5 to 70 ram, respectively. On the other hand, Bibby et al. [18] M. Boutonnet Kizling, S.G.

Vissokov and co-workers [19,20] have studied the influence of an argon or nitrogen plasma on the regeneration of an iron oxide/alumina catalyst, a commercial ammonia synthesis catalyst, after deactivation and passivation. They observed that the rate of reduction was 2-5 time higher for the plasma-treated deactivated catalyst than for the untreated one. Furthermore, the activity of the regenerated catalyst in ammonia synthesis was 10% higher than that of the fresh catalyst. In Table 4, all methods for catalyst regeneration by plasma are listed. 3.1.2.3. Study of carbonaceous deposition in advanced gas-cooled reactor. The formation of carbonaceous deposits or coke is not only a troublesome occur- rence for the processes which involve catalysts. It has also been found to occur on the metallic surfaces in contact with hydrocarbon gases in heat exchanger systems. A tangible example in this matter is the formation of carbonaceous deposition that has been found to occur under certain conditions on the steel fuel pins of the advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR). Even if, in this case, the formation of coke is not directly related to catalysis, the results obtained by Cairns et al. [21] as well as Blaikley and Jorgensen [22] concerning occurrence of carbonaceous deposition in non catalytic processes are of interest to get a better insight into this problem. These groups were interested in protection against carbonaceous deposits on the fuel pin and boiler in an advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR). To simulate the formation of the carbonaceous deposit in an AGR, they both used a radio frequency plasma discharge in the presence of a CO2/CH4 gas mixture to produce carbon deposits on a steel surface. Parallel experiments carried out under the same conditions on a silica-coated steel gave no carbon-deposition. They explained this difference by the fact that the surface of the steel itself acts as a catalyst in the modification of the gas composition near the surface and consequently favors carbon formation while deposited silica is inactive in this reaction. They have independently shown [21,22] that the formation of carbonaceous deposition is a catalytic M. Boutonnet Kizling, S.G. Jiir~ts /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 1-21 13 process. In addition, they have disclosed that nickel and iron, which enter into the composition of steel, are responsible for this catalytic effect. 3.1.2.4. Modification of oxide surfaces. Metal oxides are usually employed as a support for metal catalysts. It is well known that the adhesion and interaction between the metal particles and the support are important factors that influence the stability, activity and selectivity of a catalyst. The techniques of surface modification, for example plasma, can be useful in order to improve the adhesion or to modify interaction between metal and support. The glow discharge plasma is a suitable method for modification of oxide surfaces. Considerable work has been carried out in order to study the influence of plasmas of argon and hydrogen on the surface of oxides such as SiO2, ZrO2, MoO3 or V205 on SiO2 and TiO2. The treatment of SiO2 by hydrogen plasma causes changes in the 02 adsorption on SiO2 resulting in the formation of paramagnetic centra on the surface [23]. Che et al. [24] have shown that hydrogen atoms created by microwave discharge are able to produce isolated, reduced transition metal ions at low temperature in MoO3 or V205 on SiO2 and TiO2. Argon sputtering of ZrO2 leads to a gradual build up of an oxygen-de- pleted layer with a thickness of 1.2 nm and composed of ZrO; a distribution in depth of different oxide phases is created during the process [25]. The different techniques of oxide modification by plasma described in this section are listed in Table 5. 3.1.2.5. Plasma catalytic reactor. Plasma techniques can be used to prepare in-situ catalysts deposited onto the inside walls of a reactor. Dalai et al. [26] have used the plasma technique for such a catalytic reactor. The inside wall of a tube reactor was covered with a plasma sprayed catalyst. The catalyst consisted of a mixture of metallic Fe and Co at different concentration ratios. The reactor was then used for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. BET analysis of the catalyst revealed a low surface area but despite that the uptakes of CO and O~ were found to be quite high. 3.2. Heterogeneous catalytic reactions In many heterogeneously catalyzed reactions, the reacting molecules have to be transformed into activated species. The role of a catalyst is often to promote the formation of such species. A low pressure plasma can be used to modify the chemical reactivity. Most of the reactions where the plasma technique has been involved are model reactions. However, some recent results show that the plasma technique is being employed in industrial applications as well. 3.2.1. Nitric oxide synthesis; nitrogen fixation The function of low pressure plasma in the catalytic synthesis of nitrogen oxides has been studied to quite a large extent by different research groups. 14 M.

After Venugopalan and Vep~k[29]. Among them, Amouroux and co-workers [27,28] have made very basic studies of the interaction between the chemical species which constitute the plasma and solid surfaces; they used transition metal oxides such as WO3 and MoO3. The collision of the molecules in the plasma induces an increase in the vibration energy of nitrogen molecules which then will be polarized in the neighborhood of solid surfaces and may be chemisorbed. The last step of the reaction occurs on the surface; its features depend on the nature of the metal (Fig. 2) [29]. In case of a transition metal oxide, the adsorbed, vibrationally excited nitrogen atom reacts with the free oxygen atoms from the oxides. A step similar to the one previously described can explain the process of nitrogen fixation in the system N2-CH4 [31] when the reaction is carried out in a plasma reactor (Fig. 3) [30] in the presence of a catalyst based on metals such as Fe, Cu, W, Ta or Mo [32]. According to the work of Mutel et al. [33] the use of a low pressure plasma in the synthesis of nitrogen oxides can lower the energy costs by 53% in compari- son with the industrial process used at present. However, the experimental conditions are still far from being of practical significance. 3.2.2. Synthesis and decomposition of ammonia Bergougnan et al. [34] have studied NH3 decomposition in a low pressure plasma without and in the presence of a W or Mo based catalyst. The NH3 plasma is created by a high frequency discharge (40 MHz) at low pressure (5-40 mbar). 16 M. Boutonnet Kizling, S.G.

Experimental apparatus for plasma generation. After Gicquel et al. [30]. feed The activated state of the ammonia molecule is a crucial factor of the decomposition process without catalyst. The mechanism of the NH3 decomposi- tion according to the authors is the following. The ammonia molecule in low pressure plasma produces two different excited species. The first one is an electronically excited dissociative species NH3 * (the upper pathway on Scheme 1). The second one, NH3, is a highly excited species in the vibrational energy mode; these species relax to the ground state (the lower pathway on Scheme 1). The main step which controls the reaction of decomposition is a slow, endothermic dissociation (NH3)**--+ (NH)* In the presence of a catalyst, however, the vibrationally excited (NH3)* species are chemisorbed on the surface and are involved in the catalytic reaction. The same authors [34] have studied the influence of the nature of the catalyst on the rate of NH3 decomposi- tion. Comparison of W (transition metal) and Si (semiconductor) based catalysts showed that the first one increased the rate of the reaction while the second one Nil3 +e kl /~ (NH3)** ~ (NH)* xil (Nit3), _- NH3 Scheme 1. k2 P N2 + H2 M.

[36]. inhibited the reaction. The authors concluded that the catalytic activity of any material depends on its ability to influence the vibrational energy of the plasma at the interface plasma-solid. Furthermore, it seems that the real catalyst in the reaction is not the metal itself but its nitride. The efficiency of a catalyst for NH3 decomposition will depend on its ability to form nitrides. Consequently, W based catalysts will be better than Mo based catalysts while Si will act as an inhibitor. The effect of titania [35] on the decomposition of ammonia in a plasma reactor is identical to that observed in the case of W or Mo based catalysts (Fig. 4) [36]. The chemisorption of N2 on a ruthenium black catalyst is made possible when nitrogen atoms are produced by a plasma discharge [37]. The reaction of the chemisorbed nitrogen with hydrogen forms ammonia at room temperature. Magnesium and calcium oxides show a catalytic effect in the ammonia synthesis when the reaction is carried out in the presence of an H2-N2 plasma [38]. The influence of the nature of the metal on the produced amount of ammonia is shown in Fig. 5 [29]. Similar studies carded out on iron wires [39] and platinum catalyst [40] have also shown a catalytic effect of these metals in the plasma synthesis of ammonia. 3.2.3. Synthesis and cracking of hydrocarbons An argon/hydrogen plasma can be used in a novel cyclone reactor to carry out high temperature and low pressure catalytic conversion of natural gas. The role of the argon/hydrogen plasma is to create methyl and ethyl radicals from methane, ethane and ethylene molecules. The mixture is heated before the plasma treatment [41]. Motallebi et al. [42] have studied methane conversion in a 18 M. Boutonnet Kizling, S.G. Jiir&s /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 1-21 10 o z 5 --'0 Pt / / / ,' Pt t //Jr zx Ag \"\" ..........

The products consisted mainly of acetylene and ethylene. A microwave plasma reactor has been used to carry out the conversion of methane into higher hydrocarbons such as ethane, ethylene, and acetylene [43]. Depending on the nature of the catalyst and on the plasma experimental conditions, very high selectivities to the different products could be obtained. For example, ethane gave only ethylene when the conversion was 7-10%. Here, the role of the catalyst is to adsorb hydrogen and hydrocarbon radicals and to desorb product molecules, while in the absence of plasma the function of the catalyst is to adsorb the hydrocarbon reactants, to dissociate the C-H bonds and finally to desorb the products of the reaction. Vapors of aluminum or tungsten produced in a high-temperature plasma reactor have been used as catalysts in the cracking reaction of propane. The maximum yield of acetylene was 93% when the temperature reached 4000 K [44]. Another interesting aspect of the application of a plasma to organic com- pounds is the cleaning of exhaust systems. Nonequilibrium plasma processes are beginning to find application in the removal, by destruction, of hazardous volatile organic compounds from effluent and exhaust streams of industrial plants. Electron-beam-generated nonequilibrium plasmas appear to efficiently decompose halogenated volatile organic compounds at very low concentrations in an air stream. This kind of plasma preferentially interacts with the compounds to be decomposed, leaving the carrier gas unchanged [45]. M. Boutonnet Kizling, S.G.

Hydroconversion of deasphalted uacuum resids Rouleau et al. [46] have studied the hydroconversion of a deasphalted vacuum residue in the presence of a Ni-based catalyst prepared by the electrocondensa- tion method [6]. They observed that a quite high catalytic activity could be obtained at very low catalyst concentration. Some additional properties of these catalysts, which are of importance, were that the formation of the coke deposits was prevented and the aromatization of the feed avoided. 3.2.5. Recouery of precious metals from car exhaust catalysts Nowadays, due to environmental regulations, most cars have to be equipped with a car exhaust catalyst. Despite an intensive research in this field, the efficient but expensive catalyst based on Pt/Rh metals as yet cannot be replaced by an equally effective but cheap one. In order to keep the costs of the Pt/Rh car exhaust catalyst low an efficient recycling of the catalyst has to be used. A plasma arc furnace was used by Mishra and Reddy [47] (Fig. 6) to melt different compounds of an autocatalyst in order to recover precious metals. The process is carried out in the following way: first iron metal is melted using a 500 kW plasma gun in order to be used as a collector for the precious metal. Then the charge of the autocatalysts is introduced into the reactor and melted at 1600- 1700. The metals are then separated from the metal collector. The recovery of the precious metals using this process was, in the case of honeycomb car exhaust catalyst, 91.9% for Pt, 94.6% for Pd and 91.8% for Rh. Tajmouati et al. [48] have replaced the metal collector by an oxygen gas flow produced by a plasma source, the evaporation of the precious metals took place at 1620 K. The analysis of the metal content of car exhaust catalysts can be simplified 20 M. Boutonnet Kizling, S.G. Jiir&s /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 1-21 using a technique that combines the plasma process with a spectrometric estimation. Brown et al. [49] have used a plasma coupled to mass spectrometry and Rao et al. [50] applied a plasma coupled to emission spectrometry. 4. Conclusion Plasma technology and especially cold gas plasma is finding continuously increasing application in industrial processes requiring surface chemical modifi- cation. The use of plasma techniques for catalyst preparation and catalytic reactions has interested several researchers in the field of catalysis. It appears from the reviewed studies that it is possible to prepare by these techniques dispersions of metal particles and also supported catalysts. Furthermore, the surface properties of different oxides can be modified at low temperature. Thus, with these techniques it is possible to obtain catalytically active materials with new surface properties that will in turn give modified activity and selectivity. Besides, a direct application of plasma to the activation of catalytic reactions can result in novel catalytic activities and selectivities for these reactions compared with a conventional catalytic process. So far, catalytic reactions studied by means of a plasma process, concern only nitrogen oxide synthesis and ammonia decomposition. In addition, some interesting results were obtained when a plasma process was involved in hydroconversion. Another interesting application of this process could be the development of highly effective recovery methods for precious metals from car exhaust cata- lysts. Finally, this review shows that there is a potential for successful applica- tions of the plasma techniques to the field of catalysis in order to improve existing catalytic processes.

Fax: (+46-8) 10 85 79 The application of plasma techniques in the preparation of catalysts and in catalytic reactions published during the last fifteen years is briefly reviewed. Two different types of plasma are used in this field: low temperature plasma (low pressure plasma) and high temperature plasma. The first type of plasma technique is widely used for the modification of surface oxides, and for the preparation and regeneration of catalysts as well as for catalytic synthesis and decomposition. The second type is applied for the preparation of ceramic-based supports, recovery of precious metals from used catalysts, and catalytic reactions. Both oxides and supported metal catalysts have been prepared by this method. The catalytic reactions involving the plasma technique essentially involve NO, methane or ammonia as reactants. An interesting potential for this technique is its application in the recovery of the precious metals from car exhaust catalysts.

        "dc:description": "The application of plasma techniques in the preparation of catalysts and in catalytic reactions published during the last fifteen years is briefly reviewed. Two different types of plasma are used in this field: low temperature plasma (low pressure plasma) and high temperature plasma. The first type of plasma technique is widely used for the modification of surface oxides, and for the preparation and regeneration of catalysts as well as for catalytic synthesis and decomposition. The second type is applied for the preparation of ceramic-based supports, recovery of precious metals from used catalysts, and catalytic reactions. Both oxides and supported metal catalysts have been prepared by this method. The catalytic reactions involving the plasma technique essentially involve NO, methane or ammonia as reactants. An interesting potential for this technique is its application in the recovery of the precious metals from car exhaust catalysts.",
