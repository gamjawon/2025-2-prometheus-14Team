Review Oxygen reduction reaction on Pt-based electrocatalysts: Four-electron vs. two-electron pathway Lili Zhang Suyu Jiang Wei Ma # Zhen Zhou * Engineering Research Center of Advanced Functional Material Manufacturing of Ministry of Education, School of Chemical Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, China Engineering Research Center of Advanced Functional Material Manufacturing of Ministry of Education School of Chemical Engineering Zhengzhou University Zhengzhou Henan 450001 China Engineering Research Center of Advanced Functional Material Manufacturing of Ministry of Education, School of Chemical Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, China * Corresponding author # Corresponding author Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has attracted extensive attention as an important component for sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies. However, the sluggish kinetics has hampered the practical application. Pt-based nanomaterials have triggered much interest as the most promising electrocatalyst to facilitate the kinetics of ORR. Nonetheless, a major challenge for Pt-based electrocatalysts is to precisely control the selectivity of reaction pathways and possible products (H2O or H2O2) with a reduced loading amount of precious Pt. This review systematically summarizes the strategies to regulate the ORR performances of Pt-based electrocatalysts by accommodating the adsorption energy and spatial structure. Further discussion is implemented about the key factors to accelerate the kinetics of ORR and control the 4e-ORR and 2e-ORR pathways. Finally, we demonstrate the challenges and perspectives for further development of novel Pt-based electrocatalysts. Graphical abstract This review systematically summarizes the strategies for regulating the kinetic process of oxygen reduction and controlling the 4e or 2e pathway by accommodating adsorption energy and spatial structure. Keywords Oxygen reduction reaction Electrocatalysts Platinum Selectivity Hydrogen peroxide 1 Introduction Climate issues, caused by the high dependence on fossil fuel based energy systems, have been the major global challenge facing humanity today [1]. To combat the climate change, the Paris Agreement adopted in 2015 proposed to limit the global warming to below 2 °C in this century. In the 2020s, the Chinese government will implement more effective policies and measurements to achieve the goal of peaking CO2 emission by 2030 and further approach carbon neutralization by 2060. To achieve the above objectives, some promising tactics should be employed to develop sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies for efficient and sustainable utilization of clean energy, such as metal-air batteries [2,3], proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) [4–6], and to explore green electrochemical synthetic technologies [7–11]. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), as an important process at the cathode of PEMFCs, shows sluggish kinetics, which greatly affects the energy conversion efficiency [12]. Exploiting high-performance electrocatalysts are urgently desirable; however, commercial Pt/C catalysts have unsatisfactory activity and suffer from limited reserves and high prices [13,14]. In addition, the competing pathway for the generation of H2O2 reduces energy efficiency and durability in fuel cells [15]. On the other hand, the byproduct H2O2 is extensively employed in chemical industry, medicine, and environmental remediation as an important industrial chemical (Fig. 1 ). The electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 via the ORR process is considered the promising alternative to industrial energy-intensive anthraquinone methods [16]. However, this application of ORR is confronted with the problems of low selectivity, especially on highly active Pt-based electrodes, which makes the Faraday efficiency (FE) difficult to reach 100% [17,18], seriously restricting the economic benefit of electrochemical synthesis of H2O2. Therefore, it is a great challenge to fabricate cost-effective catalysts with high electrocatalytic efficiency and selectivity. The cheap and plentiful non-platinum catalysts were exploited as electrocatalysts for ORR. For example, the ORR activity of some transition metal nitrides and carbides is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C in alkaline membrane fuel cells [19,20], and the FE of carbon-based catalysts for ORR to H2O2 is up to >90% in basic electrolytes [21]. However, the low power density and short operation life lead to the competitive disadvantage of alkaline film fuel cells. Also, H2O2 in alkaline media is prone to self-decomposition, which is not conducive to storage and transportation. In addition, carbon materials have limited adsorption and activation capability for oxygen, and the specific current for ORR is lower than that of Pt-based catalysts [22,23]. Therefore, extensive attention has been devoted to solving the bottleneck of the preferred Pt-based catalysts [24,25] for ORR in acidic media. Recently, considerable studies have been implemented for the controllable fabrication of efficient/effective Pt-based catalysts with low loading for ORR because their intrinsic ORR activity and selectivity depend on crystal structure, chemical composition, atomic coordination, and geometric morphology [26,27]. It is necessary to summarize the essential factors affecting the ORR activity and the key information regulating possible oxygen reduction pathways to elucidate the intrinsic relationship between activity and selectivity. In this review, we summarize and discuss the strategies for regulating the ORR performance of Pt-based catalysts in consideration of adsorption energy and spatial structure, including research on the enhancement of current density at low overpotentials, catalyst design for oriented products from ORR (H2O or H2O2). Then we demonstrate the prospects for the most promising future research on further improving the activity and selectivity of Pt-based ORR electrocatalysts and accelerating the development of novel Pt-based materials based on the application of advanced first-principles computations and modeling and artificial intelligence. It is expected that this review can provide inspiring guidance for the studies of ORR on Pt-based electrodes. 2 Fundamental aspects of electrochemical ORR The evaluation of the activity and selectivity is the critical criterion for inspecting the application of ORR catalysts. Also, the electrocatalytic mechanism of ORR is the fundamental basis for designing highly effective electrocatalysts. 2.1 Mechanisms The mechanisms of ORR have been extensively studied computationally and experimentally. Typically, O2 can be reduced to H2O or H2O2 through the four-electron pathway (4e-ORR, Eq. (1)) and two-electron process (2e-ORR, Eq. (2)) [16,24]. Specifically, there are three possible reaction mechanisms (Figs. 2(a) and (b) ): dissociative mechanism, associative mechanism and peroxo mechanism [28–31]. For the dissociative mechanism, the O–O bond of O2 breaks directly at the adsorption sites to form two O* species, which is successively reduced to 2OH* and then to 2H2O. For the last two mechanisms, after the O2 is fixed to the adsorption sites, it is firstly activated to form HOO*. In the association mechanism, the generated OOH* is broken into O* and OH*, gaining protons and electrons to form H2O. While, in the peroxo mechanism, subsequent addition of H+/e− pair to OOH* yields HOOH* and then forms H2O2. Notably, HOOH* may break into OH*. Eq. (1) O2 + 4(H+ + e−) → 2H2O E 0 = 1.23 V vs. RHE Eq. (2) O2 + 2(H+ + e−) → H2O2 E 0 = 0.70 V vs. RHE 2.2 Performance metrics 2.2.1 Activity The electrocatalytic activity of ORR catalysts is mainly reflected in the metrics of onset potential, half-wave potential and diffusion-limited current characterizations [31]. These parameters are determined by the different dynamic processes (kinetic, mixed kinetic-diffusion or diffusion). In general, the mass/specific current at relatively high potential are adopted to assess the ORR efficiency [32]. Accompanying with the advanced nanotechnology, the current density of some Pt-based catalysts has exceeded the U.S. Department of Energy's requirements for Pt catalysts in PEMFCs (0.44 A mgPt −1 at 0.9 V vs. RHE) [33]. Scientists also pursue and strive to achieve higher current density at lower overpotentials. According to the Sabatier principle [34], optimal catalysts should bind the intermediates with optimum strength: neither too strong nor too weak, which leads to a volcano-type relationship as illustrated in Fig. 2(c) [35]. For the ORR process on Pt-based materials, the adsorption of molecular O2 is not considered a rate-determining step because of the strong coupling between O2 and Pt atom. The theoretical overpotential is a function of the binding energies of intermediate oxygenated species (*O, *OH, or *OOH) [36–38]. The optimum binding energy should be regulated to accelerate the sluggish kinetics, and obtain high current density at low overpotentials. 2.2.2 Selectivity The ORR selectivity is a significant criterion to determine the number of transferred electrons, namely 4e-ORR or 2e-ORR [39–41]. According to the mechanisms of ORR, the reaction pathways and final products of the ORR strongly depend on the surface properties of the selected Pt-based electrocatalyst materials. ORR on electrocatalyst surfaces that strongly bond O2 molecule or OOH* intermediate to dissociate the O–O bond selectively yields H2O via 4e-ORR. In contrast, electrocatalysts that preserve the O–O bond in the key OOH* species will promote higher 2e-ORR product. Actually, the resulting HOOH* may be adsorbed and cleaved to OH*, and then O2 is reduced to H2O by the 2e + 2e pathway. Therefore, the selectivity for H2O2 generation and the Faradaic efficiency (FE) on the catalyst are important metrics of ORR selectivity. The concentration of H2O2 is generally detected using iodometry, titanium salt colorimetry or cerium sulfate (Ce(SO4)2) titration method within the defined time intervals [42]. In this respect, the chemical composition and structure of Pt-based electrodes have great influence on the production of H2O2. The surface of Pt-based electrodes with weak adsorption to HOOH* and facile diffusion of H2O2 is favorable to increase the H2O2 yield. 3 Catalyst design and system optimization Fig. 3 illustrates the relationship of ORR activity and selectivity. Specifically, there are generally two strategies to improve the ORR activity of Pt-based electrocatalysts, increasing the number of active sites (increasing the effective electrochemical active areas (ECSAs)) and enhancing the intrinsic activity of each Pt site [43]. The ECSAs can be enhanced by optimizing Pt-based catalyst structures to expose more active sites, such as controlling high-index Pt surfaces, constructing Pt-skin surfaces (hollow or core-shell), tailoring Pt nanoclusters or single atoms. The electron effect and strain effect induced by doping, alloying or support can adjust the properties of active sites and then affect the catalytic performance of Pt sites. These strategies can be addressed simultaneously to great improvement in activity. Particularly, regulating the structure and the surface properties of active Pt sites has great influence on the adsorption configuration of O2 molecules and the adsorption energy of oxygen species. These strategies lead to the O–O bond breakage or preservation, that is, oxygen is reduced to H2O or H2O2. Meanwhile, the adsorption of electrolytes and products on the electrode surface highly affects the ORR selectivity of Pt-based catalysts. In this section, we will briefly discuss the practical strategies that have been developed to promote possible oxygen reduction pathways on Pt-based nanomaterials. 3.1 Strategies for promoting 4e-ORR Theoretical studies have disclosed that H2O is the thermodynamically favored product, and, most of Pt-based electrocatalysts have been explored to promote the 4e-ORR process. Interestingly, the thermodynamics indicates that the bond breaking of the O–OH intermediate is always much more favorable than that of the *-O. Therefore, in addition to increasing the number of active Pt sites, the research should focus on optimizing the adsorption energy of *O or *OH on the Pt atoms to accelerate the kinetics of proton-coupled electron transfer. 3.1.1 Pt-skin structures Constructing a Pt-skin structure is considered promising surface engineering to maximize exposure of Pt atoms to electrocatalysis, simultaneously improving the intrinsic 4e-ORR activity with low Pt loading. Chen and co-workers synthesized a highly active Pt3Ni nanoframe (Fig. 4(a) ) through interior eroding crystalline PtNi3 polyhedra in solutions [44]. The Pt3Ni nanoframe/C catalyst exhibited 22 and 36 times higher in specific activity and mass activity versus the Pt/C catalyst, respectively. The excellent electrocatalytic efficiency of the Pt3Ni nanoframe is ascribed to the open structure and surface strain. Particularly, the subsurface Ni atoms modulate the surface electronic structure of the topmost Pt atoms, leading to lower coverage of OHad species. Then, the surface of Pt3Ni nanoframe exposes more dynamic active Pt sites for oxygen adsorption and reduction. Tian et al. reported Pt-Ni bunched nanocages (Pt-Ni BNCs) with a one-dimensional (1D) Pt-skin (Fig. 4(b)) [45]. Experiments and computations reveal that there are fewer strong Pt–O bonding sites in Pt-Ni BNCs because of the strain and ligand effects (Fig. 4(c)), causing excellent 4e-ORR performance through the integration of a hollow Pt surface and architecture. Generally, the compressive strain in the M/Pt core/shell catalyst (where M is transition metal) can also weaken the Pt–O bonding on the Pt surface and increase the 4e-ORR activity [46–48]. For example, Huang group reported a class of PtPb/Pt core/shell nanoplates (Fig. 4(d)) [46]. DFT computations revealed that the PtPb/Pt core/shell nanoplates exhibit large biaxial strains, especially, the edge-Pt and top (bottom)-Pt (110) facets undergo appropriate large tensile strains, weakening the strong Pt–O binding to optimized strength. 3.1.2 Single-atom catalysts Tailoring the nanoparticles into nanoclusters or single-atoms offers more reactive surfaces and higher Pt utilization for electrocatalysis. The interaction between Pt single atoms and the support is an important factor to regulate the ORR performance, especially the influence on the reaction selectivity. Liu et al. [49] prepared Pt single atoms anchored on the single-pyridinic-nitrogen (P-N)-atom doped carbon (Pt1-N/BP). Electrochemical tests indicated enhanced 4e-ORR activity of the Pt1-N/BP catalyst. DFT computations demonstrated that the pyridinic N-doped graphene (P-N) sites improve the distribution of Pt single atoms due to the synergetic effect of Pt and doping N. More importantly, the two O atoms of each O2 molecule prefer to adsorb on the same Pt single atom of the Pt1-N/BP catalyst. Whereas, O2 molecule bond to the two or three adjacent Pt atoms on bulk Pt. As a result, the bond length of O–O in Pt1-N/BP is longer than that in bulk Pt, meaning easier dissociation of O–O bonds on P-N-Pt sites. The possibly subsequent formation of OOH* on P-N-Pt sites continues to lengthen the O–O bond, promising more dynamically favored breakage of O–O bonds (Fig. 4(e)). Additionally, the estimated H2O2 is instable on the P-N-Pt sites because of its larger O–O bond length than OOH*, and are decomposed directly into two OH groups. These results support a high-efficiency 4e transfer process of ORR. Some other Pt single-atom catalysts (SACs), such as defective Black Pearls 2000 carbon-supported Pt single-atoms [50], and MoN anchoring atomically Pt atoms [51], have proved efficient in promoting 4e-ORR process, which is attributed to the weak adsorption of OH* on Pt surfaces coordinated with carbon divacancies or N atoms. 3.1.3 Alloying and doping PtNi alloys, as one of the most widely studied Pt-based alloy catalysts for 4e-ORR [52–55], have excellent activity because alloying weakens the adsorption strength of *O or *OH on Pt sites. However, the adsorption energy is not optimal and is not infinitely close to the top of the volcano diagram, indicating that the further improvement can be approached. Huang et al. [56] investigated surface-doped Pt3Ni octahedra with transition metals and supported on carbon (M-Pt3Ni/C), Mo-Pt3Ni/C showed the best 4e-ORR performance. According to the DFT computations (Fig. 4(f)), compared with the too strong binding of oxygenated species on Pt(111) and too weak binding on Pt3Ni(111), the oxygen binding energies at thermodynamically favored Mo doped sites of Mo-Pt3Ni/C are closer to the peak of the volcano plot. Similarly, He et al. [57] modified the surface of Pt-Ni alloys by an amorphous nickel boride membrane (Ni-B). DFT computations showed that BO2/Pt(111) has a weaker O binding energy and a lower OH binding energy than Pt(111). As expected, the Pt-Ni alloy covered by amorphous Ni-B membrane achieved significant enhancement in 4e-ORR activity with respect to the Pt-Ni alloy and Pt/C catalyst. 3.1.4 Supported catalysts The strong metal-support interaction can endow some functionalized properties to Pt sites [58–60]. The uniformly dispersed Pt nanoparticles/nanoclusters on excellent supports also have increased ECSA and electrical conductivity. For example, Zhang et al. [58] implemented a facile strategy to prepare arrays of self-supporting graphene quantum dots composited with Pt nanotubes (GQD-Pt NTAs) via an electro-codeposition approach (Fig. 4(g)). The GQD-Pt NTAs possessed a controllable porous structure, attributing to the difference in size between GQDs and Pt nanoparticles. The well-designed GQD-Pt NTAs with increased porosity displayed larger ECSA and better electrocatalytic 4e-ORR activity than pure Pt NTAs, significantly improving the effective availability of platinum. This work demonstrated that combining Pt with nonmetallic quantum dots is an effective approach to address the unsatisfactory utilization and activity of Pt-based electrocatalysts. 3.2 Strategies for promoting 2e-ORR According to the reaction mechanisms of ORR (Fig. 2), the retention of O–O bonds is necessary for the 2e-ORR pathway to selectively generate H2O2. Thus, the Pt-based catalyst surface should be designed to adsorb O2 molecules at a moderate strength to efficiently form OOH* species. Meanwhile, weak adsorption of OOH* species and H2O2 on the active site is required to stabilize the O–O bond. To cope with this challenge, related researches have been devoted to clarify the structure-activity relationship of electrocatalysts and design efficient electrocatalysts. 3.2.1 Structure-activity relationship Generally, there are three models for O2 adsorption on a metal surface (Fig. 5(a) ): Pauling-type, Griffiths-type and Yeager-type [61,62]. In Pauling-type, only one O atom coordinates with one active site, which is known as “end-on” adsorption and prefers to preserve the O–O bonding. However, in Griffiths-type and Yeager-type, the O2 molecule transversely interacts with one metal atom or “side-on” bridge coordinates with two adjacent active sites, significantly weakening the O–O bonding. Therefore, the structures of O2 adsorption on the electrocatalysts' surface play a decisive role in the ORR pathway. To improve the selectivity of Pt-based materials for 2e-ORR, it is a promising strategy by promoting the “end-on” adsorption of O2 on Pt surface and producing the weakly adsorbed OOH*. This strategy is mainly embodied in the form of encapsulated interface, alloying and SACs. 3.2.1.1 Encapsulated interface In general, the steric hindrance at the coating interface is conducive to “end-on” adsorption with a small hydrodynamic diameter on the active metal surface. Xiao et al. [63] took advantage of the steric hindrance effect to achieve the enhanced selectivity of H2O2 electro-generation. Choi and co-workers [64] compared the adsorption and reduction of oxygen on a bare Pt surface on a carbon-coated platinum catalyst, demonstrating that Pt catalysts coated with controlled amorphous carbon layers can eliminate Pt ensemble sites and then induce selective “end-on” adsorption of O2 on the modified Pt surface (Fig. 5(b)). Experiments and computations revealed that the 4e-ORR pathway is suppressed because of the thermodynamically unfavored end-on adsorption of O2 with low overpotentials. As a result, the amorphous carbon-coated Pt catalyst showed remarkably improved H2O2 selectivity. Notably, no significant H2O2 decomposition was observed through the disproportionation or reduction reactions, and, the catalyst exhibited good stability without apparent performance degradation, which was attributed to the steric hindrance of the amorphous carbon layers to the access of H2O2 and against the acidic leaching of the Pt surface. 3.2.1.2 Alloying Alloying can cause electron and strain effects to regulate catalytic performance. Alloying Pt with Ni, Fe or Co is beneficial to the 4e-ORR process, while alloying Pt with Au, Hg and other metals with weak adsorption of oxygen can promote the 2e-ORR process [62,65–67]. An ideal electrocatalyst for 2e-ORR should enhance O2 adsorption and inhibit the O–O bond dissociation. However, according to the volcano diagram, Au holds weak bonds with oxygen species and considerable selectivity but low activity for 2e-ORR. For Pt and Ni, the selectivity is limited by the strong binding of oxygen species. Zheng et al. [65] synthesized Au-Pt-Ni core-sandwich-shell nanorods by a seed-mediated method. The Au-Pt-Ni nanorods exhibited epitaxial growth features with continuous and coherent lattice fringes between the core and shell, which is helpful to regulate the ORR process to the 2e pathway. The characterization of the surface state indicated that the epitaxial growth could tune the electronic properties and may help optimize the binding energy of OOH*. As expected, compared with Au-Ni nanorods, Au-Pt-Ni nanorods displayed pronounced increase in 2e-ORR to produce H2O2. Besides, the introduction of non-metallic elements and alloying with Pt have also been studied. Li and co-workers [67] reported ultrasmall and monodispersed colloidal PtP2 nanocrystals for ORR to achieve H2O2 production. DFT computations indicated that the incorporation of P promotes weaker adsorption of OOH* on PtP2(111) than that on pure Pt, resulting from both electronic and geometric effects (Fig. 5(c)). For both the top site and bridge site of PtP2(111), the bond length of Pt–O in PtP2–OOH* is longer than that in Pt–OOH*. These effects are attributed to electron delocalization and longer Pt–Pt distance in phosphorus-rich PtP2. The weak PtP2–OOH* bond effectively suppresses the dissociative of OOH* to O*, and then realizes continuous on-site production of H2O2. 3.2.1.3 Single-atom catalysts and support effect SACs provide an ideal field for reducing Pt usage. Also, the substrate has a significant effect on the functional properties of SACs for ORR. Yang et al. [68] confirmed the supporting effect by preparing Pt SACs on two different substrates, titanium carbide (Pt1/TiC) and titanium nitride (Pt1/TiN) (Fig. 5(d)). Electrochemical tests demonstrated that the ORR activity, selectivity, and durability of Pt SACs for electrochemical H2O2 production can be significantly enhanced by converting the substrate from TiN to TiC. Energy profiles calculated by DFT can explain the reason, that is, strong affinity of oxygen species on Pt1/TiN possibly results in the surface poisoning, while Pt1/TiC retains more O–O bonds with higher selectivity toward H2O2 generation. Choi et al. [69] reported a sulfur-doped zeolite-templated carbon (ZTC) with extra-large sulfur content and a unique carbon structure as the support for Pt SACs. As shown in Fig. 5(e), the ZTC has a highly curved three-dimensional (3D) networks of graphene nanoribbons, forming highly S-coordinated Pt structures (Pt/HSC). Compared with low S-content Pt/LSC and Pt/ZTC, the Pt/HSC exhibited higher selectivity in H2O2 production. According to the X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, more oxidized Pt species were present on support with higher S content, which provide more Pt1 species or Pt n clusters with smaller size. Thus, the electrocatalytic results are consistent with the report, the H2O2 selectivity increased as the Pt n cluster size decreased and maximized with the smallest Pt1 species. Moreover, the experimental operation of CN− poisoning and H2O2 decomposition confirmed that the atomically dispersed Pt species are indeed the ORR active sites and almost inactive in decomposing H2O2. The theoretical model structure showed a square-planar-type ligand arrangement of the Pt-S4 complex. After the solvation of Pt-S4 complex in water, a distorted Pt center appeared outside the original square-planar geometry, probably making Pt to be kinetically more favorable for two-electron pathway via ligand substitutions (Fig. 5(f)). Li's group [23] dispersed atomic Pt in amorphous CuS x hollow nanospheres to synthesize h-Pt1-CuS x catalysts via a redox-based ion-exchange approach. The h-Pt1-CuS x with high Pt1 concentration delivered high selectivity and large current for electrocatalysis of O2 to H2O2, and its H2O2 kinetic current is one order of magnitude higher than that of some other reported Pt SACs (Fig. 5(g)). The high isolated Pt1 concentration and the strong interaction between Pt and S promote the satisfactory 2e-ORR pathway, and more exposed reactive sites accelerated the mass transport by hollow porous structure, resulting in the elevated performance. 3.2.2 Electrode structures As mentioned above, the ideal electrocatalyst for 2e-ORR should meet effective transfer of O2 and active intermediates. At the same time, the rapid diffusion of the product should be guaranteed to inhibit the reduction (2e + 2e pathway) or decomposition of H2O2 [17]. Some Pt-based catalysts are powders supported on zero-dimensional or two-dimensional nanostructures. When they are used as electrode materials, their physical accumulation may obstruct the diffusion of H2O2 to the liquid phase and H2O2 will be adsorbed and reduced. Moreover, with the production and enrichment of H2O2, the adsorption of oxygen on the electrode surface is blocked, resulting in the decrease of catalytic activity and selectivity for 2e-ORR. Taylor et al. [70] studied the effect of Pt loading and surface morphology on 2e-ORR activity. They found that the production of H2O2 was significantly higher with low Pt loading than that with high Pt loading. This is attributed to the larger interparticle distance of low Pt loading that effectively avoids the adsorption of H2O2, confirming the presence of possible “series action pathway” and highlighting the non-negligible role of Pt interparticle distance on the pathways [70]. Other explorations on a superhydrophobic three-phase interface or superhydrophobic air-breathing cathode for effective H2O2 generation have also emphasized the importance of electrode structures [71,72]. Therefore, Liu's group [73] designed a hierarchical, three-dimensional (3D) free-standing electrode (Fig. 6(a) ), indicating the great practical application in the electroreduction of O2 to H2O2. Also, for the aforementioned Pt SACs supported by porous hollow spheres, the porous structure of supports can significantly enhance the diffusion of H2O2 [23]. 3.2.3 Electrolytes and additives As shown in Fig. 6(b), two mechanisms are proposed for ORR at the double layer [74], namely, inner-sphere electron transfer process (ISET) at the inner-Helmholtz plane (IHP) and outer-sphere electron transfer process (OSET) at the outer-Helmholtz plane (OHP). Although the structure of the double layer in acid (left) and alkaline (right) media is not dramatically different, the effects of solvent water dipoles, ions and chemisorbed O2 should be taken into account. The OSET process is more feasible to promote the 2e-ORR pathway compared with the ISET process. Moreover, specifically adsorbed OH− promotes the OSET process and leads to produce H2O2 as the final product, since the increased OH− can poison the catalyst surface and favor the end-on adsorption of O2 at low-density active sites. However, high-concentration OH- also facilitates the catalytic decomposition of H2O2. Thus, an appropriate pH for the electrolyte must be explored [17,75,76]. Besides, it is meaningful to partially poison the electrocatalyst surface with other species in place of OH− [77]. Previous reports suggested that Pt can be poisoned by the introduced S and Se atoms [78], or the surface of the Pt electrode can be modified by exposing it into an electrolyte containing halogen ions (Cl−, Br− or I−) [79–81] to regulate the adsorption of oxygen species. Unfortunately, the Pt electrode with partially poisoned sites may have a lower current because of the decreased electroactive area. This challenge has motivated the development of cationic additives, such as N(alkyl)4 + (N(alkyl)4Br or N(alkyl)4I) [82], which can improve the selectivity but not decrease the current. 3.2.4 Reactor configuration Engineering electrocatalysts and other components into efficient devices is an equally important quest to complement the research for developing the electrocatalysts with desirable intrinsic properties. The ideal structure of the electrode should have sufficiently enough number of adsorption sites while allowing the rapid desorption of H2O2 before the further reactions. In addition to the weak metal-H2O2 interaction, the rapid mass transport conditions are also conducive to the desorption of H2O2. Therefore, it is necessary to put forward certain requirements for the assembled devices [17,77,83]. Figs. 6(c–e) show several electrode and device designs that tackle the above requirements in different ways [77]. One of the most popular designs is the gas diffusion electrode (GDE) with porous layers and hydrophobic components (Fig. 6(c)). The GDE acts as a membrane between the O2-containing gas and liquid electrolyte. The electrocatalyst is supported on the GDE, and when O2 flows through the membrane to the solid-liquid interface, it can be immediately reduced upon dissolution. The GDE has some advantages over ordinary electrodes in the solution, for example, there is negligible to consider the limitation of O2 solubility because the mass transport of O2 in the gas phase is generally faster than that in liquid electrolytes. Note that too much catalyst should not be deposited onto the GDE, as this would physically block the gas flow and then lower the activity. In the laboratory, increasing the current and maximizing the active area of the electrode can be realized by using carbon felts or foams with a highly porous structure to offer large surface areas. When scaled up, this concept can be taken in the form of a trickle bed reactor (Fig. 6(d)) or a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (Fig. 6(e)). For the former, the working electrode is a fixed bed containing electrocatalyst particles in a large chamber, and the liquid electrolyte is added into the top of the fixed bed and then trickles down under gravity; thus, the electrolytic products can be collected at the bottom. Concentrated solutions of H2O2 can be provided by controlling the flow rate of the electrolyte. For the latter, the cathode and anode are separated by a proton exchange membrane, meaning that the generated H2O2 does not diffuse to the counter electrode and be degraded. Notably, this cell presents the possibility of harvesting electric energy and H2O2 production at the same time, which has obvious economic advantages and energetic benefits. In the experiment, Yang and co-workers [17] compared the FEs of several catalysts applied on the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) setup, GDE and membrane electrode assembly (MEA) setup. As seen in Fig. 6(f), the difference is up to 90% in the FEs among RRDE over the practical reactors, intuitively confirming the effect of mass transport (includes reactants and products) on the efficiency of electrosynthesis. 4 Conclusions and perspective Exploring efficient and cost-effective Pt-based nanomaterials as ORR electrocatalysts is of vital significance for the energy conversion technology and electrosynthesis. With the unremitting efforts of academic and industrial researchers, considerable achievements have been made. In this review, we systematically summarized the design strategies such as surface engineering and electronic structure with low Pt loading for efficient electrocatalytic 4e-ORR and 2e-ORR processes. The above points have been comprehensively discussed; however, the following key issues should be given priority for ORR. (1) Insight into oxygen activation and reduction processes. The formation of possible H2O or H2O2 via ORR process accompanies with the breaking or retention of O–O bonds, respectively. The main characteristics are the selection of O2 adsorption configuration and the existence of OOH* species. Presently, although most studies about the electrocatalytic products and computations for the ORR process are approached, it is imprecise to determine the possible ORR pathways only by DFT computations. Hence, some in-situ characterization techniques combined with time-evolving measurements for the catalyst surface are urgently recommended to gain important information, such as the adsorption configuration of oxygen molecules [84], possible oxygen-containing intermediates [85] and the variation of active centers. (2) Advanced computations are required to efficiently clarify the kinetic information of electrochemical reactions at the liquid-solid interface. Conventional DFT methods, such as the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model, told that the O–OH breaking is thermodynamically more favorable than the *–O breaking, where ORR is more possible to perform on the path of water formation. However, some catalysts showed high selectivity for H2O2 production, indicating the inconsistency between the computations and experiments. This is contributed to the effect of potential and pH on the selectivity. In contrast, the solvation model can achieve a high degree of consistency that is infinitely close to the experimental conditions; however, it is inaccessible to the traditional models. For example, Liu's group [86] developed a constant potential hybrid-solvation dynamic model (CP-HS-DM) that uses explicit water molecules and implicit solutions to solvate the reaction species at the solid-water interface. According to this model, they revealed the origin of the selective formation of H2O2 in ORR, and the dependence of the results on potential and pH. This study identifies previously elusive factors, provides new insights into the selectivity of ORR, and offers a new model for effectively simulating the electrocatalytic atomic-level dynamics of ORR at the liquid-solid interface. (3) Establishing screening frameworks for highly efficient catalysts to accelerate the development of new Pt-based materials. The structure design and construction of Pt-based electrocatalysts for ORR are based on the traditional model of combining scientific intuition and experimental accumulation, which has a long research cycle and is difficult to search for high-performance electrocatalysts on a large scale. For example, the surface of isolated Pt atoms is more prone to “end-on” adsorption of O2 molecules in theory, which is conducive to two-electron transfer reduction. However, because of the influence of electron and stress effects, it is accessible to promote the four-electron oxygen reduction on the Pt SACs in the experiments. Overall, the selectivity of Pt SACs catalyzed oxygen reduction is highly dependent on the support. Powerful tools, such as artificial intelligence (AI), are needed to quickly screen suitable substrates to facilitate selective catalytic ORR pathway on Pt SACs. In recent years, machine learning has been widely used in the field of materials science [87–89]. Therefore, by combining with in-situ characterizations, computations and machine learning, intelligent screening frameworks may be established to guide the development of more novel ORR catalysts. (4) Key problems of ORR in energy storage and conversion devices. For 4e-ORR, the development of anti-toxic (toxic species such as alcohols or carbon monoxide) Pt-based catalysts holds focus, because of their application in PEMFCs or metal-air batteries. The ORR performance of cathode Pt-based catalysts can be decreased sharply by a small quantity of toxic species because of the multifunctional electrocatalytic ability of Pt-based materials. In recent years, core-shell structures (such as carbon/polymer coating and Pt@transition metal) or Pt SACs can effectively improve the methanol resistance [49,90,91]. The core-shell structure obstructs the direct contact between the surface of the Pt atom and methanol molecule, which improves the methanol-resistant ability but reduces the number of active sites. Fortunately, Pt SACs can enhance the resistance to methanol toxicity and maximize active sites due to the need of at least two adjacent Pt sites for methanol electro-oxidation. Therefore, catalysts with isolated Pt active sites (SACs or single-atom alloys (SAAs)) are promising for applications. For 2e-ORR, the isolated Pt active sites exist not only in SACs, but also in some alloys, such as the so-called SAAs [92–94]. In these alloys, isolated Pt active sites can be obtained by controlling the content of Pt. Combining the advantages of single-atom catalysts and alloys, SAAs may be a promising option to orient the 2e-ORR selectivity on Pt-based catalysts because of the important influence of alloying components on the ORR pathways. Moreover, with the purpose of generating H2O2 economically and efficiently, the anode reaction with low electrode potentials can be used to replace the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which allows the electrolysis device to be unaffected and restricted by OER in a wide potential window, effectively reducing the voltage input. For example, coupling the anodic oxidation of organic molecules to obtain economic products (methanol oxidation to formaldehyde, benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde, glycerol oxidation to dihydroxyacetone, and furfuryl alcohol oxidation to furfural), and coupling urea electro-oxidation or electro-Fenton to sewage treatment. Recent advances in ORR have demonstrated key factors to control 4e-ORR and 2e-ORR on Pt-based electrocatalysts. Combining in-situ characterization techniques and advanced computations with the help of machine learning would the most prolific in guiding the design of novel materials and promoting the development of economic applications of ORR.

        "dc:description": "Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has attracted extensive attention as an important component for sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies. However, the sluggish kinetics has hampered the practical application. Pt-based nanomaterials have triggered much interest as the most promising electrocatalyst to facilitate the kinetics of ORR. Nonetheless, a major challenge for Pt-based electrocatalysts is to precisely control the selectivity of reaction pathways and possible products (H2O or H2O2) with a reduced loading amount of precious Pt. This review systematically summarizes the strategies to regulate the ORR performances of Pt-based electrocatalysts by accommodating the adsorption energy and spatial structure. Further discussion is implemented about the key factors to accelerate the kinetics of ORR and control the 4e-ORR and 2e-ORR pathways. Finally, we demonstrate the challenges and perspectives for further development of novel Pt-based electrocatalysts.",
