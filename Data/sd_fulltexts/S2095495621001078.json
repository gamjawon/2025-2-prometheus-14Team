Fig 3 Operando experiments to form graphene on Pt at 1173 K from ethylene decomposition at 1 mbar. The SEM image taken after cooling to RT reveals the formation of graphene flakes (dark) growing along the step-structure of the Pt catalyst. The bright areas denote agglomerations of narrow steps (roughness) that are not overgrown at the chosen chemical potential. The small islands arise from segregation of bulk dissolved carbon during cooling. The tiny white dots are silicate nanoparticles arising from segregation of bulk-dissolved silicon out of Pt. (Scale arrow 10 μm). The XPS data were taken under the same conditions and show during growth the evolution of coverage and species as function of time. The low BE of the graphene is due to a strong electronic interaction between carbon and catalyst. (Source after ref. [39,40]). Fig 4 Morphology of graphene used for catalytic applications. The quality is heterogeneous as can be seen from the ordering. The area in the left image is poorly ordered, non-planar and contaminated with nanoparticles of iron oxides. The area in the right image from the same specimen from which the left image was taken is well-crystalline and largely planar with some buckles and few areas of several layers randomly stacked. No metal impurities were detected. (E. Willinger, unpublished). Fig 5 HV (200 kV) scanning electron micrograph of a CNT made from methane.

Coming from microstructural analysis it became quickly clear that the richness of morphological and hence surface electronic variations in this class of materials should be suitable for the development of a science base for heterogeneous catalysis. With this concept in mind, Dangsheng was critically involved in the development of several catalytic reactions with carbon namely the selective oxidation of ethylbenzene [1,2]. In the year 2005 he became principal investigator of the carbon catalysis project [3–5] and enlarged its scope to selective oxidation of small alkane molecules [6] and expanded into a wide range of liquid and gas phase reactions [7,8] exploring the rich reactivity portfolio of graphene-derived systems in addition to the carbon nanotube (CNT) basic structure. In his work he used the knowledge about the reactivity of carbon to adapt them (functionalization with N and O as examples) for pre-determined classes of reactions. This approach is orthogonal to the widely used concept of synthesizing carbon nanostructures and then search for catalytic applications without prior knowledge of chemical and reactive properties. The idea to start from functional properties of an existing carbon nanostructure when developing catalytic application triggers the following description of the potential of nanocarbons. Carbocatalysis The term was created about 10 years ago with Dangsheng Su being one of the protagonists behind this development. The motivation came from a conference series connecting German and French scientists collaborating in an EU-funded project (ELCASS). The team became quickly international and the resulting community began to expand as seen from the growth of citations shown in Fig. 1 . This history explains the strong focus of the community on catalytic applications dominating the research rather than nano-chemistry bringing about novel materials. The much larger materials community quickly evolved their carbon structures about 10 years earlier into the field of energy-related catalysis and especially electro-catalysis. The three most cited papers [9–11] in this community (each over 5000 citations) deal with N-doped graphene and g-C3N4 as structures in oxygen electrochemistry. Returning to the smaller carbocatalysis community, it is important to notice that the history of catalysis based upon the surface functional groups of carbon is much older [12–14]. An excellent account of this science can be found in the book [15] of Serp and Figureido. The modern carbocatalysis is deeply rooted in the physical chemistry of carbon surfaces as reveals the analysis of the interdisciplinary collaboration in the field presented in Fig. 2 . The work reaches out to study carbon materials in multiple catalytic [16,17] reactions. Besides synthetic chemical reactions the use in environmental clean-up reactions is of particular relevance. The absence of toxicity of agglomerated carbon is here an important factor when the catalyst is for example in contact with drinking water. This does not mean that individual carbon nanoparticles are not toxic. True nanoparticles in isolated form can have substantial biological activity [18,19] and must be carefully observed. It is the functional groups on the surface of such particles that make it likely that they occur agglomerated and can thus safely be used in real applications. One typical issue in carbocatalysis is the question about the truly active [20] sites. The term “metal-free” [10,21] designates the observation that carbon structures can catalyse reactions such as oxidation or hydrogenation [22–24] although they do not contain transition or noble metal species which are believed to be critical for such reactions. There is a never-ending debate that trace contaminations of such metals in carbon arising from their synthesis that can be found upon careful analysis [6] would act as single site catalysts [25] and explain the performance of the system. The alternative is that despite of the trace impurities (mostly not at the surface of carbon) it is the semi-metallic nature of carbon with its ability to stabilize free radicals [26] and the presence of terminating functional groups providing solid acid-base centres that effect the catalytic transformations [27]. For the remainder of this work, we follow the path that nanocarbons exhibit a generic catalytic activity bound to their structure. This does not exclude the well-founded notion that metal atoms [28–30] are highly active in certain applications notably in the electrocatalysis of oxygen. Graphene and catalysis The emergence of modern carbocatalysis is connected with the advent of graphene in a broader community. It is clearly noted that this is a re-emergence [31] as the surface chemistry of single layers of graphite connected with exfoliation and derivatisation to graphite oxide is a very traditional field of carbon chemistry studied long before [32–35] the graphene hype. Graphene offers [17] the chance to study and exploit the three modes of chemical reactivity of sp2 carbon. The conceptual clarity of graphene as prototypical carbon catalyst is the reason to confine the following discussion to this type of carbocatalysts. It is by no means indicated that graphene should be particularly suited or active in catalysis in comparison to the many other forms of nanocarbon namely activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbon [36] or the g-C3N4 family [37,38] of materials. It is important to note that generic graphene without defects and without a termination layer is chemically nonreactive. It is the “real structure” of nanocarbons that brings about catalytic reactivity. For this reason, it is found that graphene derivatives can be tuned to substantial selectivity in catalytic reactions. The three forms of reactivity of sp2 carbon occur at the perimeter (typical activated carbon), at internal structural and chemical defects within the flat sp2 network (typical nanotubes) and due to local curvature resulting from non-6-membered rings built into in the 6-membered carbon skeleton (typical fullerenes). The origin of these real structure elements is in the growth mechanism of graphene usually performed on a catalyst [39,40]. Catalysis grade graphene stems from exfoliation-reduction procedures and is much more defective that surface-grown samples. From Fig. 3 , one can see how the properties of the catalyst used to grow the carbon control the integrity and morphology of the product. The ratio of armchair to zig-zag terminations, the formation of internal defects, the incorporation of non-6-membered carbon rings and the flatness of the product are all dependent on the catalyst and its ability to activate the molecular carbon source. Analogous statements can be made for the catalytic growth of carbon nanotubes [41–49]. The non-catalytic generation of nanocarbon sheets from molecular precursors [7] is another way to produce large volumes of graphene-like carbon with, however, a wide range of real-structural features and hence a complex reactivity pattern. The conceptual clarity of graphene that can be synthesized separately into any of the three real structures is in reality somewhat blurred by the embodiment of specimen. Depending on the synthesis procedure one finds structural heterogeneity and sometimes residues from the catalytic synthesis within the sample. Fig. 4 gives an impression of a graphene catalyst-grade sample and its typical inhomogeneities. The reservation about metal-free catalysis clearly applies also here. The obvious reactivity occurs at the edges of the flat graphene plane. The terminal sp2 atoms occur as zig-zag and armchair configurations giving rise to different local electronic structures. The dangling bonds are saturated with hydrogen giving rise to high chemical stability. Depending on synthesis conditions or post-synthetic treatments [15,17,50] these hydrogen terminations can be substituted by oxygen, nitrogen, halogens, phosphorous or sulphur to name a few variations. Catalytically most relevant is the oxygen functionalization that can bring about basic (phenol) and acidic functions (carboxylic) together with a large number of stable oxygen terminations that are catalytically non-reactive. It is the inclusion of the O–C bond into the electronic structure of the graphene base that decides over the reactivity. For the present purpose it is sufficient to consider the chemically reactive species indicated in the Table 1 . There is a variety of additional oxygen functional groups [51] that are chemically inactive yet they contribute to the oxygen content of the carbon and present reactive sites in high-temperature combustion. These groups are not shown here. The difference of the two neighbouring C–C bond distances next to the functional group gives a good impression of the extent of perturbation of the sp2 hybridisation through the functional group. It is obvious that the addition of such functional groups gives rise to a deviation from planarity. The curvature creates strain in the graphene system and prohibits dense stacking of several functionalized graphene fragments as it is often observed on nanostructured carbons made from graphenic basic structural units. An impression can be seen in Fig. 1 (left plate). The relative stability of the functional groups differs greatly with carboxyl groups representing “bound CO2” being the most labile species. The variation is an indication about the involvement of the O-C bond into the graphene electronic structure. The numbers further indicate that all these terminations are unstable with respect to the unfunctionalized state. It is thus possible to analyse the different groups by thermal decomposition of the graphene. Care has to be taken in performing such experiments as the desorption kinetic can be slow and complex leading to convoluted responses. A high resolution method [53] based upon non-linear desorption temperatures developed for carbon nanotubes was able to clearly show the relative abundance of the species and relate it to the chemical structure. This methodology is still rarely applied as compared to standard TPD experiment that does not give an unambiguous picture about the species distribution [54]. This distribution of sites strongly depends on pre-treatment and sample history [55–57]. It is thus not useful to consider the properties of functional groups as a material characteristic. It is rather a fingerprint of the treatment condition for a given material. It should be noted that the pyrone groups are redox-active and create or stabilize radical structures [7] whereas the other functional groups exhibit acid-base properties when in contact with a protolytic solvent such as water. The elegant “Boehm titration” methodology [52,54,58] gives access to the distribution of pK values [58] of the respective groups. It is pointed out that these values are not only related to the chemical structure of the functional group itself but relate also to the local structure (neighbouring functional groups) and to the perfection of the graphene backbone. The combination of titration, spectroscopy and probe molecule reactivity can give a detailed insight [59] into the reactivity of carbocatalysts. It is important to know that the combination of Brønsted basicity and unpaired electronic structure can give rise to unexpected reactivity of carbons against oxygen. The sheer mechanism of carbon oxidation [60–64] depends on this complex interplay. Although ideal graphene and graphite exhibit only non-localized charge carriers (semimetal) these electrons are not amenable for transfer to adsorbates in flat sp2 configurations. This changes profoundly with curvature of the materials leading to a fractional sp3 hybridisation and hence to charge localization [65]. Electron spectroscopy [6,66–73], EPR, NMR and conductivity [74,75] are suitable methods to detect the consequence of curvature on the local electronic structure. The catalytic consequence is that that at curved graphene sections, on fullerenes and on carbon nanotubes to name some prototypes, chemisorbed oxygen can be activated through charge transfer from the pi-electronic system of the nanocarbon and form superoxide, peroxide and OH radicals. These species are strong oxidants and effect many organic oxygen transfer reactions described in the literature and collected in reviews [9,16,17,76,77]. Such catalytic activity does not necessarily require pyrone [58] functional groups but is also an indication for the presence of curved sections or curved nanostructures leading to deviation from planar sp2 carbon centres. The origin of curvature can be manifold. In graphene it mostly stems from “doping” meaning incorporation of heteroatoms. The first candidate for this is the support material on which the graphene was grown. Another prominent dopant is oxygen resulting for example as residue from graphene oxide and reduction (RGO). There is in addition a large family of synthetic nanocarbons in the form of ribbons that are multiply twisted and curved and hence exhibit a large density of localized electrons and hence a superior catalytic activity in oxygen-related chemistry [78–81]. The chemical design of shape and curvature by combining rings of different sizes is a fascinating possibility for tailoring activity versus stability of such nanocarbons. A very prominent dopant is nitrogen [82–91]. In graphene nitrogen can occur at the perimeter as heterocyclic functional group, as amine, amide and NOx species. Intricate is the in-lattice doping of sp2 carbon with nitrogen. This form of doping is frequently referred to as “quaternary nitrogen” meaning that in a multi-layer carbon system one interlayer bond is formed deforming locally the planar flat graphene topology. In graphene this is by definition not possible which has led authors [92–94] to designate this interlayer dopant as “graphenic N” species. Here a distinction seems adequate. For carefully CVD grown N-doped graphene it was possible by a combination of theory and advanced electron microscopy to confirm the substitution of N into the planar lattice. The extra electron stayed localized around the defect and was found [95] both by theory and by imaging. However, this situation is to be discriminated from the widely used oxidation-ammonolysis procedure of chemical doping where defective nanocarbons are heat-treated in ammonia or other N species. In this case nitrogen likely is incorporated into the perimeter of internal defects as terminating heteroatom with either a hydrogen on it (amide) or as quaternary species with an additional bond to a distant carbon structure. This species causes or marks a location in the carbon that is curved [96] and hence can provide localization of conduction electrons. Also such structures that are existing prominently in technical doped nanocarbons [97] (activated carbon) can activate dioxygen in the way described above. These situations should however be discriminated from the traditional view that it is the extra electron of the N atom [26] that directly activates oxygen. In such a picture it would be hard to understand that the N-doping can act catalytically because there is no facile way that after one reaction cycle the extra electron should return accurately to the nitrogen atom except of that the N atom got oxidized and is thus destroyed as active site. XPS is a widely used technique to address both the electronic structure of carbocatalysts and the type and number of functional groups/dopants. A wide range of assignment protocols is in use and often poorly resolved spectra are used for deconvolution. This procedure is hampered by the widely different line profiles stemming from the heterogeneities of structural elements. Whereas true sp2 graphenic structures give rise to a core hole coupled asymmetric line shape [98], the more molecular components exhibit Gauss-Lorentzian lines and some contributions may be insulating (sp3 hybridization) and cause Gaussian profiles for differential charging. The data for Fig. 4 describe a maximum of 1 monolayer carbon on a conducting substrate. Whereas the main line describes a graphene network and exhibits a pronounced asymmetry, the segregated carbon species are not well-characterized in their hybridisation state and exhibit symmetric lines. These and similar data from highly defined samples were used [99] to provide the assignment data listed in Table 2 . The spread of C1s data is larger than that of the O1s data. This due to intrinsically different linewidths [98] of the two transitions (sharp for carbon, broader for oxygen) that preclude a good resolution of local heterogeneity in the O1s spectra. They are merely diagnostic of the direct bond between oxygen and carbon (the chemical function). The carbon 1 s line is a highly diagnostic tool for electronic structure and local heterogeneity (sp2 vs. sp3 and curvature effects) of a carbocatalysts provided it is measured with high resolutions (0,25 eV and better). A comprehensive approach has been developed [100] to combine DFT theory and line profile analysis for the heteroatoms O and N for diagnosing the carbon electronic structure. The test samples of this study were derived from melamine pyrolysis and were studied without complementary real structure analysis. In this way the generalized procedure suggested in this work is applicable for carbocatalysts with the spread of results in comparison to other work being likely due to different real structures. For the assignment of N- species a chemical approach was described [101] using temperature-programmed desorption in operando with XPS and the fragments of desorption to discriminate heterocyclic from substitutional species. In general, the assignment by XPS became more consistent [102] through the simultaneous analysis of C1s and heteroatom core levels and the complementary use of experimental or theoretical information. Why carbon in catalysis? The discussion reveals that the conceptual argument that carbon is a well-defined and tuneable material for catalysis is difficult to bring into practical operation. The still much more complex function of carbon acting as support for metal species in catalysis is not considered here at all. This raises the fundamental question why more work should be put into a more rigorous definition of the relation between synthesis and reactivity of carbon. Only then a rational concept could be used to design carbon catalysts by exploiting the large toolbox of organic synthesis and functionalization that is amenable to this class of materials. This argument of broad tuneability is a strong reason per se to further exploit the structure function relation of carbon. A similar argument is the chemical simplicity of carbon catalysts in comparison to metals supported on metal-oxides or complex oxide materials usually applied in catalysis. This argument is only true if the complexity of structure–function relations in carbon can be tackled [23,103] by precise characterisation. In the same category falls the argument that the existence of three structural properties that can be varied should give the chance to tailor a material for specific catalytic applications. Functionalization at the perimeter, curvature of the graphene backbone and doping by substitutional heteroatoms are the three modification concepts. They can be applied in a controlled additive way if the bottom-up synthesis [78,104] is applied. If, however, a given material is modified or prepared by polymerisation of a molecular precursor [38,80,105,106] without its prior decomposition into individual atoms, then the free combination of these concepts cannot be applied as a real structure as superposition of translational and local structure comes already with the matrix. Crumbled sheets of carbon from organic precursors, carbons with basic structural units of molecular dimensions, multiwalled carbon nanotubes and mesoscopic aggregates such as fabrics, CNT forests or mesoporous carbon are examples of such complex matrices. They are often used in catalytic studies, as they give access to large quantities of material needed for chemical experimentation and they are cheaply available but they bring structural motifs with them that are very different from the ideally assumed flat sp2 carbon network. The chemical inertness of this flat sp2 network is another advantage of carbocatalysts. It provides strong chemical stability and isolates reactive sites from each other with no own reactivity as it often occurs with conventional supports like metal oxides. This is a key reason for the broad application of carbon supports in metal catalysis. This inertness also holds with the exclusion of alkali metal graphite intercalation compounds [107] for the strict exclusion of the carbon bulk as participating factor in the catalytic function. Metals and reducible metal oxides exhibit substantial activity of their sub-surface volume to reactants of the process under study. The confinement of a heterogeneous reaction to the physical interface between solid and reactant phase is in many cases not valid [108] which leads to complications in design, control and analysis of catalytic systems. The stability of carbon allows for an effective use of transfer reagents [8,23] for oxidation and hydrogenation as only the functional groups with sufficient space around them that can act as adsorption space (“landing sites”) for the reagents activate the reagents. Transfer of the activated species by spill-over mechanisms is feasible as the inertness of the carbon allows motion of activated fragments without being attacked by them. Additional advantages are that carbon is a highly abundant resource and can even be obtained from biological sources [109,110] by technologically facile preparation [111] methods. The caveat about the structural complexity of such materials [7] and the role of potential metal impurities must not be ignored here. The fact that carbon can be oxidized fully to a gaseous product would further allow to practice a reactor concept in which the spent carbon catalyst is not removed but burnt inside the reactor and new carbon is filled into the reactor and thus allows for frequent “catalyst change”. The anisotropy of many forms of carbon would further allow for an effective regeneration: if a carbon surface is contaminated or deactivated by restructuring or loss of functional groups it is feasible to burn away a surface layer of the carbon and functionalize the new pristine surface inside the catalytic reactor. Energy transfer to the reaction is facile for carbon. The following Table 3 gives an impression about the vast potential of carbon as heat-transfer component in catalytic beds. Energy-demanding reactions such as dehydrogenations should profit from using carbon materials as catalyst. This effect can be multiplied if the electrical conductivity of carbon is used for generating this heat by electron motion (DC, induction, microwave). The electrical conductivity gives further rise to the widespread application of graphene and nanocarbons [112,113] as electrode or component in batteries [114] and in heterogeneous electrocatalysis. The glassy carbon support electrode is well-known. Nanocarbon fillers for electrocatalysts are widely used in science and technology of fuel cells and PEM electrolysers. It is not clear to what extent carbon [115–117] is acting as electrocatalyst, as sacrificial support and as transport medium for charge carriers. Model studies with organic molecules supported on CNT gave a clear correlation [117] of quinone group density with the electrocatalytic water splitting activity. There are also disadvantages to be taken when carbocatalysts are used. The by far most important one is the still poor knowledge of the real structure of carbons. The enormous richness of structures arising from molecular organic chemistry is also available to form solid carbon. The three concepts of reactivity for sp2 carbon are deviations from the ideal carbon network (“defects”). If only non-6-membered topologies [80,118] are allowed as additional element then combinations between graphene and fullerenes and any form of twisted sheets or ribbons [78] will result. If then point defects are added and a small number of non-hydrogen heteroatoms (dopants) [92,94,119] are allowed, the number of extended structures gets very large. Even larger expands the space for structural options if a mixture of sp2 and sp3 hybridisations [120] is allowed as then 3-dimensional structures will result combining sheets twists, cages and spheres plus their defective forms. In this situation the comprehensive characterisation of the real structure is of paramount importance. Over the years the toolbox for analysing carbons is well filled with spectroscopic methods and temperature-programmed reaction experiments. The author states that the correct application of these tools is not always observed, thus leading to conflicting, erroneous and incomplete structural descriptions. Classic deficiencies are the wrong estimation about the limited surface sensitivity of XPS or RAMAN spectroscopy, the neglect that carbocatalysts contain molecular entities as basic structural units intermixed with more crystalline aggregates and are thus hybrid molecular solids (giving rise to complex line shapes in spectroscopy) and the neglect of transport limitations for heat and electron flow in non-compact fluffy heterogeneous materials. Electron microscopy suffering from the poor contrast of carbocatalysts can be misleading by the severe distortion of the complex 3-dimensional shapes through the 2-dimensional projection (twists look amorphous as do oblique oriented basic structural sp2 units). Electron energy loss spectroscopy as powerful tool to determine the local sp2/sp3 ratio can be erroneous by the neglect of anisotropy preventing detection of orientation dependence effects. Thermal analysis is hampered by poor heat flow leading to transport-induced broadening and even structural features in the traces and by using non air-tight equipment with the consequence of combustion overlaying desorption. The methodical combinations of electron microscopy [121] and XPS for well-ordered systems[99] and NMR/IR spectroscopy for poorly ordered systems [111,122] gives rise to strong expectations for a more realistic determination of the real structure that should then explain the trends obtained from temperature programmed desorption [53] and reaction [123] studies. It is still a hard problem to identify structure–function relations as a small number of active sites is sufficient to create catalytic activity. It is bold to state that the main structural features e.g. “graphene” are the catalytically active components in a complex carbon structure. For this reason, the term “carbocatalysts” is highly adequate as it does not refer to any particular prototypical allotrope or prevailing structural element. The small number density of active sites is an additional weak point for carbocatalysis. Stable carbons exist either as flat sp2 units or as 3-dimensional diamond-like and possibly hydrogenated forms that must not be compact nanoparticles but can form mesoporous [81,104,124] materials. In carbocatalysts the number of suitable anchoring sites for reactive centres is limited in relation to the total number of surface atoms. The active sites are thus diluted. They cannot be enhanced independently of the electronic structure of the carbon as they are an integral part of the system. Hence making carbocatalysts more active is a difficult task as properties and number density of the sites cannot be varied independently. The terminations of carbon nanotubes [27,117] provide a suitable study object for measuring the number of active sites. The local structure of the terminating functional groups is homogeneous and suited for titration experiments. Indeed [103], only a small number of highly active sites contributes [125] to the performance of the class of CNT-based carbocatalysts. Changing the site density deviating from nominal sp2 hybridisation creates in addition problems with the chemical stability. The ability of a carbon atom in the graphene unit to host functional groups equals the chance to be removed from the solid as volatile organic species. A variation of active site density independent from the reactivity of the “support” is only possible if active phase and support structure are made chemically independent. Carbon-supported systems can hence be tuned in activity. This is used in a vast number of embodiments of catalysts that fall outside the scope of this work. The price to be paid is a strong chemical difference at the interface between carbon and active phase leading to stability problems through either consumption of the carbon by activated reagents or through sintering of the active phase due to insufficient bonding between it and the carbon support. For catalytic applications it is thus preferable to stick to the carbocatalysis concept in order to make a real difference to oxide-supported systems. An elegant way around this limitation was found by polymerizing ionic liquids filled with metal ions onto carbon nanotubes. This composite provides a strong chemically bonded organic interface [126–128] between the carbon backbone and the binder of the metal ions. Another disadvantage is the small number of molecules that can be activated by metal-free carbocatalysts. Besides reactive molecules [23] it is mainly oxygen that is activated. Hydrogen, nitrogen or CO for example are not activated to chemical reactivity by carbocatalysts. For such substrates metals on or in carbon are essential. The class of small alkane molecules often used to synthesize nanocarbons can also be activated by carbon. The resulting pyrolysis leads to secondary carbon deposition and the formation of molecular hydrogen. An example of the secondary carbon deposition on a carbon nanotube that was made with the help of a Ni nanoparticle is shown in Fig. 5 . This negative reactivity of carbocatalysts may turn into an advantage when the pyrolysis of methane becomes a synthesis pathway for green hydrogen gas. Then nanocarbons may be effective, cheap and non-toxic catalysts. Future directions of carbocatalysis The answer to the question of the preceding section is yes, carbocatalysis is a relevant branch of catalysis science now and in the future. The positive intrinsic advantages of nanocarbons as versatile platform for tailoring surface chemical properties for electrocatalytic and chemocatalytic reactions is and stays the key feature. As take-home message from the evolution of the field two aspects will need critical improvement: - The synthesis of carbon structures needs to be scaled up in academic studies to achieve better homogeneity and options for post-synthetic clean-up processes. The tradition to work with samples of 1 g and less must be abandoned and lot sizes of 10–20 g are needed. - Techniques for formulating catalytic entities are critically needed. Pasting “inks” of nanocarbons on metal discs for electrochemical evaluation is not useful to find out about the intrinsic property profile of the carbon. Using loose powders or poorly defined pressed “split” of nanocarbon in gas phase catalysis is equally unsuitable for property evaluation. In both cases stability problems through ill-defined mesoscopic transport gradients obscure the true performance. Fortunately, there are many formulation techniques that were developed for using carbons [129–131] as structural high-performance materials. Hot pressing, binder-filler systems and infiltration processes are mentioned. It is most important that the community begins to develop adequate toolboxes for formulating their products. Material-specific performance characteristics can then be measured and compared. The depressing slowness of catalytic technology to adopt the advantages of carbocatalysis stems to a large extent form the absence of sufficient quantity of formulated material for evaluation in typical chemical engineering set ups. This service must be delivered by the carbocatalysis community. Another area of fruitful development of carbocatalysis would be to tackle reactions where carbocatalysts can really play their intrinsic advantages. The present dominating family of oxidation reactions is of limited potential for carbocatalysts as under conditions of high performance the systems are not as stable [132] as one may want to see. One area poorly researched so far is dehydrogenation reactions of organic molecules to generate hydrogen gas and olefines for example. Here, high temperature stability and a small reactivity for unwanted condensation reactions (soot formation) are critical properties. Evaluating the origin of total dehydrogenation as discussed with Fig. 5 may be a starting point to develop a class of carbocatalysts where not much competition comes from classical systems. This holds in particular when the heat management issue and desired direct heating of the catalyst are taken into perspective. The other area where progress begins to emerge [22,115,133,134] is electrocatalysis. The conductivity of carbocatalysts [79,135] and the kinetic stability of some systems [136] promise a true metal-free alternative [137] to existing transition metal electrodes. This holds the more when not water oxidation, but organic electrochemical reactions are considered as options to introduce renewable electricity in an effective manner into future chemical processes where heating should be minimized to save CO2. Carbon materials offer a relatively facile approach towards highly desirable 3-d tailored electrode systems [138] that are cheap enough so that they can serve even as sacrificial electrode in the same way as stated above with spent catalysts in gas phase reactions. Epilogue Would Dangsheng Su still be with us he surely would have contributed strategically to the evolution of carbocatalysis. He and his strong innovative and large team would have had the chance to approach a central challenge in the evolution of the field. He may have rightly chosen the perfection of structural analysis of carbocatalysts before and after reaction experiments. Here likely the largest lever is found to boost the rigorous development of suitable materials for a given catalytic application. As long as the complete real structure of catalysts is not known it is difficult to understand the function of its manifold of individual structural elements. From there, synthetic efforts can be directed to generate such structural elements on a stable carbon backbone and get access to large enough quantities allowing material-specific assessments of the performance-structure relation. To reach this goal a consistent “handbook” of procedures and best practices needs to be compiled and practiced by the community. Standardization and verification protocols lead to self-consistent descriptors for the function of carbocatalysts that can guide computer-aided design and manufacture. This level of maturity may be reached easier with carbocatalysts than with any other family of catalytic materials as the whole toolbox of organic chemistry is available for analysis and synthesis. This for the entire catalysis science important opportunity can be realized by the determined cooperation of the carbocatalysis community.
