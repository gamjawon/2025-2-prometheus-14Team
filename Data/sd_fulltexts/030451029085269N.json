MAHADEVAN Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras 600 036 (India) (Received January 13, 1989; revised January 8,1990) Summary Synthesis of new hydrogel polymers based on 2-hydroxyethyl meth- acrylate and other functional monomers is described. These copolymers are useful for anchoring palladium and rhodium species. The resulting supported catalysts are effective for the hydrogenation of alkenes, alkynes and dienes under mild conditions. The supported catalysts have been characterised by chemical analysis, particle size measurements, IR, TGA and X-ray photo- electron spectra. Kinetics of hydrogenation have been evaluated using the concepts applicable to slurry reactors. The hydrogenation proceed through the 'unsaturate route'. Relative reactivities of a few substrates, solvent and particle size effects and selectivities by product analysis have been assessed. These catalysts possess excellent recycling efficiencies. Introduction Polymer-supported catalysts have been studied extensively because of the many advantages they offer [1-3]. Most of the work reported concerns the use of phosphinated polystyrene as support matrix [4,5]. Other func- tional groups such as anthranilic acid [6], pyridine [7], N,N- dimethylaminoethyl [8] and carboxyl [9] have also been employed. Gen- erally, relative reactivities for a group of substrates are reported [10] along with product analysis to establish selectivity [11]. In a few cases kinetics of reduction have been studied [12]. Both chemical [13] and spectroscopic means [12] have been employed to ascertain the nature of the active species. With palladium on polystyrene supports, both the zero as well as the +2 oxidation states have been shown to be effective [13,14] while with rhodium the +1 and +2 states have been implicated [15,16]. Even though supported reagents such as ion exchange resins based on polystyrene are useful in aqueous media, transition metal species anchored on such hydrophobic supports are not generally used in aqueous media. Hydrophilic supports such as hydrogels have been used for anchoring oxidation catalysts [17-20]. Gel-entrapped catalysts, where finely divided metal particles are dispersed in the hydrogel, function as useful hydrogena- tion catalysts [21, 22]. Using such gel-entrapped catalysts, it has been shown 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 190 that the reduction is controlled by the swelling ability of the solvent as well as the solubility of hydrogen in the solvent [21]. However in solvents with good swelling capacity for the gel, the catalyst suffered considerable metal leaching [21]. In view of the above we have synthesized crosslinked hydrogel co- polymers with ligands suitable for binding the catalytic species. Such supported catalysts are useful in polar media, besides possessing good recycling efficiency. Experimental All chemicals were of AnalaR grade. The monomers 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), 4-vinylpyridine (VP), 1-vinylimidazole (Vim) and A^JV-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMA) were purified by vacuum dis- tillation under nitrogen. N,N'-methylene bisacrylamide (MBAm) and acryla- mide (AAm) were recrystallised from methanol and chloroform respectively. Substrates such as acrylonitrile (AN), methyl acrylate (MA), hex-1-ene (H), cyclohexene (CH), styrene (STY), butyl acrylate (BA), methyl methacrylate (MMA), glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), ethyl acrylate (EA), dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), propen-1-ol (AA), propyne-1-ol (PGA) and norbomadiene were also purified by vacuum distillation under nitrogen. Norbomene (NB) was used as received. C'is-2-butene-l,4-diol (BED) was purified by fractional distilla- tion while 2-butyne-l,4-diol (BYD) was recrystallised twice using acetone/chloroform (m.p. 57 C). Diethyl maleate (DEM) was a Fluka sample and distilled prior to use. Diethyl fumarate (DEF) was prepared from fumaric acid and ethanol and purified by vacuum distillation [26]. Sorbic acid (SA) was recrystallised from methanol [m.p. 135 C]. The salts PdCIa, Pd(OAc)2 and RhCls-xHzO were Johnson-Matthey products and were used as received. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 983 instrument, employing the KBr pellet technique, in the range 4000-600 cm~1. ^HNMR spectra were recorded on a Varian EM-290 instrument using CDCla/DMSO- de solutions with tetramethylsilane as internal standard. UV-Visible mea- surements were made using a Carl-Zeiss PMQ-II spectrophotometer. XPS were obtained on a VG Scientific ESCALAB Mark-11 spectrometer using MgKa X-ray radiation. Pelletised samples were mounted using silver paint for XPS analysis. Thermograms were taken using a Stanton Redcraft-783 simultaneous thermal analyser in static air atmosphere at a heating rate of lO'^min\"1. The particle size distribution of the anchored catalysts were determined using a Malvem (3600E) particle size analyser. Since the synthetic method employed to prepare the copolymer leads to the polymer in a finely divided form, the degree of swelling of the polymer as well as the anchored catalysts in various solvents was determined as follows: a known weight (0.5 1.0 g) of the dry powdered polymer was placed in a 10 ml specific gravity bottle. It was attached to a vacuum line and pumped 191 for 1 h. Solvent was added under vacuum and the contents weighted immediately. The polymer was allowed to equilibrate in the solvent for 24 h. Depending on the solvent and its swelling ability, different amounts of fresh solvents were added to maintain the level constant after equilibration and the contents weighted again. Using data on the polymer density, the weight of solvent associated with a given weight of the polymer was determined. An identical procedure was employed to determine the degree of swelling of the catalysts. Metal content of the supported catalysts was determined as follows: 50-100 mg of the metal-anchored polymer was digested with cone. H2S04 (~3ml) under heating and the solution clarified by addition of hydrogen peroxide (~2ml). The clear extract was heated to decompose excess hydrogen peroxide and cooled. The metal content was then determined spectrophotometrically [23,24]. Details of the hydrogenation procedure have been described earlier [25]. This method of determining the rates by measuring the volume of hydrogen absorbed as a function of time is different from that of measuring hydrogen uptake by bubbling hydrogen gas through the slurry [22]. Synthesis ofcopolymer The monomers being soluble in water, a water-in-oil suspension techni- que was employed to prepare the copolymers. The monomer feed of composition HEMA (45mol%), VP (25mol%), DMA (25mol%), MBAm (4 mol%) and AAm (1 mol%) was dissolved in the minimum amount of water and the pH adjusted to 7.0 with 9M sulphuric acid. This was to avoid hydrolysis of the ester function during polymerization. The mixture was suspended in 500 ml of carbon tetrachloride in a 1-litre three-necked flask fitted with mercury seal, stirrer, condenser and nitrogen inlet. The suspen- sion was stabilised with 500 mg of sodium lauryl sulfate. It was deoxy- genated by bubbling nitrogen while being rapidly stirred for 1 h at room temperature. It was then heated on the steam bath to 50 C and 10ml of 0.02 M ammonium persulfate added. Stirring, heating and passage of nitrogen was continued for approximately 3h, during which time the copolymer began to separate as discrete gel particles. The carbon tetrachlor- ide was removed by distillation and the polymer gel washed several times with warm distilled water. The swollen gel was then suspended in 500 ml of methanol and stirred for 2h. The gel was filtered and resuspended in methanol for a further 2h. This was followed by a similar treatment in 500 ml dry acetone. The nearly dry gel was further dehydrated by refluxing in benzene using a Dean-Stark adapter, whereby the water was removed as the azeotrope. The fully dehydrated gel was washed with dry ether and dried in vacua. The yield of the copolymer was found to be 80%. Following an identical procedure, the copolymer containing 1-vinylimidazole instead of vinylpyridine could also be prepared. Infrared spectrum of the copolymer showed the following absorbances: 1605cm\"1 (pyridine), 1730cm\"1 (ester carbonyl), 1635cm\"1 and a broad 192 peak at 3400-3450 cm\"1 (amide), 1300 cm~1 (dimethylamino group), 3350cm\"1 (broad, OH) and 3500cm\"1 (N-substituted amide). The co- polymer was analysed for HEMA content by an acetylation procedure [27] and basic nitrogen content by an ion-exchange method. The HEMA content was 42% and the basic nitrogen was estimated to be 6.16%. Together the VP and DMA content works out to be 45%, the rest being comprised of MBAm and AAm. The thermogram of the copolymer showed almost 3% water loss at around 90-100 C, with decomposition setting in around 240 C. Loading of metal ions on polymer Three samples of polymers (viz. Pi, Pn and Pm) were employed with differing particle sizes. The particle size distribution of the loaded catalysts was determined, as the loading process caused further subdivision of the polymer. Catalyst I 5 g of Pi was added to 60ml of 1:1 DMF/HgO containing 800 mg of Pd(OAc)a and the suspension stirred for 12 h at room temperature. The polymer turned dark green and was collected by nitration and washed thoroughly with methanol, acetone and ether and dried in vacua. The palladium content was 58.5mgg~1. This sample was found to be an active hydrogenation catalyst with no further treatment. The thermogram of the loaded polymer was similar to that of the matrix polymer. From the particle size distribution data, the average particle diameter (the volume surface area mean diameter) dp, has been calculated using the following equation [27]: E (Xi/dpi) where -X, is the weight fraction of the particles of average diameter dpi. The value determined was 137^. Catalyst II 4.0 g of a more finely divided polymer (Pn) was stirred with a solution of 750 mg of Pd(OAc)a in 50 ml of 1:1 DMF/ethanol for 12 h at room tempera- ture. The loaded polymer was filtered, washed thoroughly and dried. The green polymer had a palladium content of 87mgg~1 and was active as a hydrogenation catalyst with no further treatment. Average particle diameter of this catalyst was found to be 26 fz. Catalyst III A coarser polymer (Pm), of particle size larger than that used for preparing Cati and Catn, was employed here. 800 mg of Pdda was reacted with stoichiometric amount of sodium chloride to give NagPdC^ in 1:1 DMF/water (50 ml). 4 g of Pm was stirred in this solution for 12 h at room 193 temperature. The isolated palladised polymer was brick red in colour and contained 138 mg palladium per gram. The average particle diameter of Catni was found to be 250 p.. Since Catm was inactive for hydrogenation, it was treated as follows: (a) 1.0 g of Catm was added to 50ml of DMF/HzO saturated with sodium acetate and the suspension was refluxed for 2 h. The polymer turned grey in colour (Catm.i). (b) 1.0 g of Catm was suspended in methanol containing 0.25 mol 1~1 of sodium hydroxide. This was then hydrogenated by passage of hydrogen using the method of Yu-Pei Wang and Neckers [10]. The isolated catalyst was lustrous black in colour (Catni^)- (c) 1.0 g of Catni was suspended in 50ml methanol and cooled to 0 C with stirring. 250 mg of sodium borohydride was added in portions to the suspension over a period of 45 min. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for a further 30 min. The isolated catalyst was lustrous black in colour (Catm-s). For the sake of comparison, 500 mg of Catn was also reduced with sodium borohydride. In addition a 250 mg sample of Catn was heated in air at 150 C for 3 h to assess the effect of heating on catalysis. Catalyst IV 500 mg of rhodium chloride was dissolved in 25 ml methanol and 4 g of PI stirred with this solution for 12 h at room temperature. The polymer was filtered and washed with methanol and ether and dried. It was pink in colour and had a rhodium content of 32.5 mgg~1. Since Cativ was not active for hydrogenation, it was reduced with sodium borohydride at 0 C as described earlier. The resulting catalyst was dark brown in colour (Caty). Caty also had an average particle diameter of 137 JU. IR spectra of the metal-loaded polymers showed that the metal ions were bound mainly through the pyridine and dimethylamino functions. It is possible that the OH groups of HEMA are also involved in binding the ions. Results and discussion To ascertain the oxidation state of the metal ions in the supported catalysts, XPS data were collected and are shown in Table 1. In the same table, data for various palladium and rhodium compounds as well as some polymer-supported species reported in the literature are included. XPS data of the recovered catalysts are given for comparison. It can be seen that in Pd(II) compounds the binding energy values for the 3dsn and 3da/2 states vary from 341.9 eV to 344.4 eV respectively. This is due to the different ligands associated with the metal ions. Pd(II) supported on phosphinated polystyrene shows values of 338.6 and 344 eV for the same states [12]. With the present polymer PdClg shows higher binding energies than Pd(OAc)2.

Considering that we are dealing with complex systems, the data indicate Pd(II) as the active species in Cati and Catn, whereas in Catm subjected to reduction (Hg/NaOH or NaBU^) it is Pd(0). It is unlikely that treatment with sodium acetate would lead to formation of Pd(0), although the XPS data seem to indicate this. The XPS of the recovered catalysts do not show any change compared to the fresh material (Table 1) and thus we can conclude that the reaction conditions do not cause any reduction ofPd(II) to Pd(0). Both Cati as well as Catn (freshly prepared or recovered) could be freed from all palladium by a cyanide treatment in ethanol [4]. On the other hand Catm.2 and Catm-3 were unaffected by the above treatment. However they could be converted to the Pd(II) state by treatment withp-benzoquinone in acetone containing HC1 [28]. With Cativ the binding energy values are 310 eV Od^) and 314 eV (3daa) which are characteristic of Rh(III) [16]. Treatment with sodium borohydride lowers these values to 308 and 312 eV respectively in Caty. This rules out the formation of Rh(II) species, which have been shown to be the active species in certain other supported rhodium catalysts [16]. The active catalyst, Caty, has rhodium in the +1 state. Thus this catalyst is similar to that reported by Holy [29]. 195 TABLE 2 Comparison of the activity of various catalysts for the hydrogenation of acrylamide\" Species [Cat] [Acrylamide] TON1' (ing-atom r1) (molF1) (mol (g-atom)\"1^1) Cati 1.10 0.075 386 Catn 1.11 0.075 491 Catm 5.20 0.075 no reaction Catm.1 5.20 0.075 10 Catn,., 5.20 0.075 21 Catnip 5.20 0.075 69 Cat,v 0.95 0.075 no reaction Caty 0.95 0.075 320 Catn 1.68 0.060 436 Catn (treated with NaBH4) 1.68 0.060 387 Catn (heated at 150 C for 3 h) 1.68 0.060 351 a = 3.16 x 10~3 mol I\"1; temp. = 33 C; solvent:methanol. ...,,, ,. , ,, , ,., Rate (mol l-^-^x 3600 Activity has been expressed in terms of turnover number, TON = - - ,_. [g-atom of catalyst] 1 ' The activities of various catalysts were compared under identical conditions using the substrate acrylamide in methanol. The data in Table 2 show that Catn, which has an average particle diameter of 26 /i, is more reactive than Cati (dp = 137 fz). Catm is not active for hydrogenation, while the activity of the pre-treated catalysts increases in the order Catm.i < Catm-2 < Catin-3- The poor reactivity of Catm.i is probably due to the incomplete replacement of chloride by acetate. It is also clear that reduction by bubbling hydrogen under basic conditions is less effective than sodium borohydride treatment. Catm-s has palladium in its zero oxidation state, and it is less reactive than Cati which has palladium in the +2 oxidation state. This is due to (a) the larger particle diameter of Catm-s compared to Cati and (b) the lower reactivity of Pd(0) species compared to Pd(II). The fact that Pd(+2) is more active than Pd(0) under the conditions employed is further confirmed by reducing Catn with sodium borohydride and comparing the activity of the reduced species with that of Catn- As shown in Table 2, the reduced form exhibits only 85% activity of the unreduced Catn. Cativ, which is inactive towards hydrogenation, becomes active on treatment with sodium borohydride (Caty). Heat treatment of the Catn also reduces the activity to about 70% of the unheated sample (Table 1). This is not because the metal ion is reduced, but could be the result of changes in the matrix structure. Further studies were confined to Cati, Catn and Catv. The catalytic activity is affected by the solvent, as is shown in Table 3 for the hydrogenation of acrylamide and acrylonitrile in various solvents. The reported values of hydrogen solubility [21] in some of these solvents are also tabulated along with the swelling ratios of the polymer (Table 3). Also given are the swelling ratios for the catalyst in methanol and water.

Among these solvents, the highest rates are obtained in methanol. This can be attributed to the relatively high solubility of hydrogen in this solvent. However, from the swelling data it is clear that the swelling capacity of methanol is low compared to other solvents. Although the swelling ratio is 35% in water, the rates are lower in this medium. Thus it can be concluded that for hydrogenation using the above catalysts, hydrogen solubility in a solvent is the deciding factor, overriding the swelling capacity of the solvent. Such a situation arises only when most of the catalytic sites are available on the surface of the particles. This is in contrast to the observations of Hines et al. [21]. The lower rates observed in DMF, DMSO etc. may be due to the strongly coordinating nature of these solvents, which compete with the substrate for the active sites. In order to substantiate the effect of hydrogen solubility on catalytic activity, the hydrogenation was also studied at high pressures and the results are given in Table 4. When a hydrogen pressure of 50 bar is employed, water is found to be 70% as efficient as methanol. On the other hand, under -amoient conditions (total pressure = 1 atm) the efficiency of water as a medium of hydrogenation was only 15 25% of that of methanol (Table 3). Thus it can be concluded that higher hydrogen pressure increases the rate of hydrogenation. The catalysts recovered after the reactions at 50 bar Hg pressure were found to retain 95-98% of the original metal content.

The collected data with Cati, Catn and Caty appear in Table 5. The data lead to the following conclusions: terminal alkenes are reduced faster than cyclic alkenes; rates of reduction of alkenes increase considerably if the double bond is conjugated to amide, carbonyl, nitrile, phenyl or carboxyl functions; conjugated dienes are also reduced rapidly; the geometry around the double bond, if cis, leads to higher rates; it is also clear that alkynes are reduced at much higher rates than the corresponding alkenes, indicating considerable selectivity; strained olefins are reduced rapidly. In the set nonbomene, norbomadiene and cyclopentadiene the rates of reduc- tion are in the order NB > DCPD > NBD, although similar double bonds are being reduced in these compounds. In all cases the rates obtained with Catn are very much higher than those with Cati and Caty. The data on the reduction of acrylates and methacrylates indicate the adverse effect of the size of the substrate on the rate of reduction. Rates were determined as a function of the concentration of catalyst, [Catalyst] (mg atom/L) 0.8 1.6 [Catalyst] (mg atom/L) Fig. 1.

A linear dependence is observed at lower values, while at higher concentrations the rates become independent of the amount of catalyst. At lower concentrations of the catalyst (low catalyst loading), the rate of reaction is low but the transport of hydrogen from the gaseous phase to the liquid phase is rapid. On the other hand at high concentrations of catalyst (high catalyst loading), as the reaction proceeds at a rapid rate the amount of dissolved hydrogen is depleted in the medium. Thus hydrogen transport becomes the rate-limiting factor, resulting in the rates becoming independent of the catalyst concentration. Rates increase linearly with hydrogen concentration up to a value of 3.16 X 10~3 mol 1~1 ( = 577.9 mmHg) (Fig. 2). However no attempt was made to follow hydrogenation above this concentration of hydrogen. Plots of rates us. substrate concentration appear in Fig. 3.

However with acrylonitrile and phenylacetylene as substrates, the rates are independent of the sub- strate at all concentrations. With other alkynes, viz. 2-butyne-l,4-diol and propyn-1-ol, an initial increase in rate is observed with increasing substrate concentration, followed by a gradual reduction in rate (Table 6). Sorbic acid also exhibits a similar behaviour. The lowering of rates may be due to the substrate inhibition. The high coordinating ability of alkynes and conjugated dienes leads to the complexation of more than one substrate molecule to the same catalytic site, resulting in species which are inactive towards hydroge- nation, thus retarding the rate. When the hydrogenation reaction was carried out in the absence of any substrate, no hydrogen uptake was observed. This overrules the possibility of metal hydride formation prior to the addition of substrate to the catalyst. Based on the above observations the hydrogenation can be envisaged to follow the 'unsaturate route mechanism' as reported by Modelli et al. [30]. 201 TABLE 6 Effect of van ation of alkyne/dien ie concentratiol i* on hydrogenatit in rates BYD Rate X 104 PGA Rate x 104 SA Rate x 104 (moll-1) (moll-is-1) (moll-1) (moll-is-1) (moll-1) (moll-is-i) 0.006 0.83 0.008 0.86 0.008 0.60 0.010 1.25 0.011 0.99 0.013 0.89 0.016 1.38 0.017 1.26 0.016 1.28 0.021 1.61 0.022 1.27 0.027 1.83 0.041 1.13 0.026 0.96 0.040 2.08 0.062 0.98 0.039 0.74 0.080 1.78 0.083 0.91 0.133 0.77 0.106 0.77 \"BYD and PGA with 2.5 ing-atom Pd I-1 of Cat,, SA with 2.5 ing-atom Pdl-i of Catn.

Kinetic analysis As has been shown by Satterfield [31], kinetic analysis of data involving a catalyst in the form of a slurry requires determination of mass transfer coefficients. Slurry reactor operations have been employed to evaluate the kinetics of hydrogenation [22,32]. The rate of hydrogenation Ny can be expressed as [31,33]: C, 111 +-. ^+-.

Assuming that the particles are spherical, which is an approximation, the area can be calculated as 6M A..=^- dppp where At is the weight of the catalyst per unit volume of the slurry (gml~1), dp is the average particle diameter (cm) and pp the density in gml~1 (density was found to be 1.25 g ml\"1). Substituting for the value ofAp in eqn. (I): Ce^ 1 rfpPp/1 1^ N^ AiA, 6M \\kc ks) (2) According to eqn. (2), the plot of CJNy vs. 1/M should be linear with an intercept on the y axis. If the initial portions of the rate us. catalyst concentration curves are considered (Fig. 1), plots of Ce/Ny us. 1/M would pass through the origin (Fig. 5). As mentioned earlier, at low catalyst concentrations the rate of transport of hydrogen from the gaseous phase to the liquid phase is rapid, resulting in high AL values. l/AiA becomes negligible and hence eqn. (2) takes the following form: C/N-dppp(-]-+l-} ce'NV~ 6M \\kc kJ (3) Thus from the slopes of the plots of Ce/Nv us. 1/M (at low catalyst loading) (Fig. 5), the composite constant (I/Ac + 1/^s) can be evaluated. The linear dependence of rates on hydrogen concentration (Fig. 2) at low catalyst loading indicates that the reaction at the catalytic site is faster than the transfer of hydrogen to the surface of the catalyst. Thus 1/Ag becomes negligible compared to 1/kc. Under these conditions eqn. (3) can be rewritten as: ,, 6MCeAc N^= e c (4) dppp Thus Ac can be calculated from the slope of the linear plots ofNy us.

The values of Ac a1\"! ^s for a few substrates with Cati, Catn and Caty appear in Table 7. For the substrates BYD, BED, PGA and AA, which also give similar results, data on kc as well as kg have been estimated (Table 7). In spite of the very low concentrations of the substrate employed, the values of Ac are found to vary for most of the substrates. The surface rate constant kg varies with the reactivity of the substrate. Dependence of As on the reactivity of substrate as well as the absence of metal hydride formation suggest that As is the rate constant for the reaction of hydrogen with the JT-complex (Step (ii) in Scheme 1). If the portions of the curves in Fig. 1 at high catalyst concentration are considered, plots of Ce/Mr vs. 1/M are linear with intercepts on the y axis (Fig. 4). According to eqn. (2), value of this intercept is related to the mass transfer coefficient AL. However, estimation of AL requires knowledge of the area of the gas bubble Ab. In the present study hydrogen was not bubbled through the slurry, instead it was maintained at a constant pressure (577.9 mmHg) above the slurry which was kept stirred at 300 rpm. Such rapid stirring resulted in a vortex of slant height 2.5 cm, with reaction 204 TABLE 7 The calculated values otkctta dks for various substrates Substrate Catalyst *c ks (cms-1) (cms--1) Cat, 0.0346 0.0290 acrylamide Caty 0.0219 0.3846 Catn 0.0151 0.4744 Cati 0.0510 0.1122 methyl acrylate Caty 0.0426 0.3293 Catn 0.0667 0.8333 acrylonitrile Cati Catn 0.0385 0.0211 0.1613 0.5368 2-butyne-l,4-diol Cati Catn 0.0309 0.0116 0.3225 0.4852 2-butene-l,4-diol Cati 0.0070 0.2381 propyn-1-ol Cat, 0.0228 0.1904 propen-1-ol Cati 0.0159 0.1194 Fig. 5.

Since the dimensions of the vortex were not always constant, the calculated value ofA^ is subject to error. Hence only an approximate value for k^ was estimated and was equal to 0.17 0.04 cm s~1 within experimental error. As the surface rate constant kg was calculated based on the assumption that all particles are spherical, which is an approximation, no attempt was made to evaluate the effectiveness factor (if), Thiele modulus (<f>s) and the intrinsic rate constant (Ay). Additionally, evaluation of these parameters require data with various sizes of catalyst particles. Product analysis Product analysis has been carried out for three substrates viz. 2-butyne- 1,4-diol, dicyclopentadiene and sorbic acid. In each case, the reaction was stopped after 1 equiv of hydrogen had been adsorbed and the catalyst was removed by filtration. The filtrate was then concentrated on the rotary evaporator. After all the methanol had been removed, the residue was dissolved in carbon tetrachloride and solvent removed. This was repeated three more times and the residue analyzed by NMR. With BYD as the starting material, the NMR spectrum showed only the signals corresponding to that of cis-2-butene-l,4-diol (64.10 (d, 4H, CH2 CH=, </=4Hz); 64.41 (broad, s, 2H, OH); 55.62 (t, 2H, CH=)). Absence of butyne-diol or the completely reduced product was evident from the spec- trum. This implies a selectivity of more than 98%, as well as cis addition of hydrogen to yield alkene from alkyne. With DCPD the residue was a solid, m.p. 57 C. This is the product obtained when the cyclopentene ring remains intact [36]. Proton NMR of the product has a signal at 65.2 due to the olefinic protons in the cyclopentene ring and an unresolved multiplet at 61-2 due to aliphatic protons. Disappearance of the signal at 6 5.6 (oleflnic protons in the norbomene ring) provides further support for this structure. With sorbic acid as the substrate, the residue indicated a mixture of hexenoic acids. Thus with dienes there is evidence for 1,2- as well as 1,4-addition. It is also likely that the initially formed monoene isomerises under the reaction conditions. Recycling efficiency The recycling efficiencies of Cati, Catn and Catv have been followed after each cycle by determining the rates as well as metal contents (Table 8). Under ambient conditions the metal loss is found to be ~0.5 mg per cycle. Even after use at high pressures, the catalyst retains almost 95 98% of its metal content (Table 4). Conclusions The very good recycling efficiencies, together with their usage in polar protic solvents, make these transition metal supported catalysts very useful 206 TABLE 8 Recycling efficiency of the catalysts\" Number of cycles 12 Cat, (0.040 g) Pd content (mgg~1) 58.50 57.00 56.00 53.00 52.00 51.20 ratexlO'Cmoir's-1) 11.88 11.56 11.30 10.78 10.40 10.25 Catn (0.027 g) Pd content (mgg~1) 87.50 86.50 85.30 rateXlO^moll^s-1) 15.20 14.89 14.76 Caty (0.060 g) Rh content (mgg~1) 32.50 32.20 31.00 30.00 28.10 ratexlO^moll\"^-1) 8.28 8.25 7.78 7.69 7.42 Substrate: [Acrylamide] =0.075 moll\"1; solvent: methanol; = 3.16 x lO\"3 moll 1; temp. = 33 C. in hydrogenation reactions.

These copolymers are useful for anchoring palladium and rhodium species. The resulting supported catalysts are effective for the hydrogenation of alkenes, alkynes and dienes under mild conditions. The supported catalysts have been characterised by chemical analysis, particle size measurements, IR, TGA and X-ray photoelectron spectra. Kinetics of hydrogenation have been evaluated using the concepts applicable to slurry reactors. The hydrogenation proceed through the ‘unsaturate route’.

        "dc:description": "Synthesis of new hydrogel polymers based on 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate and other functional monomers is described. These copolymers are useful for anchoring palladium and rhodium species. The resulting supported catalysts are effective for the hydrogenation of alkenes, alkynes and dienes under mild conditions. The supported catalysts have been characterised by chemical analysis, particle size measurements, IR, TGA and X-ray photoelectron spectra. Kinetics of hydrogenation have been evaluated using the concepts applicable to slurry reactors. The hydrogenation proceed through the ‘unsaturate route’. Relative reactivities of a few substrates, solvent and particle size effects and selectivities by product analysis have been assessed. These catalysts possess excellent recycling efficiencies.",
