Tel.: +86 29 88302604. Two new porphyrins (3a, 3b) were synthesized and characterized by IR, UV–vis, 1H NMR, MS and elementary analysis. The catalytic activity of the synthesized porphyrins to lithium/thionyl chloride (Li/SOCl2) battery is evaluated by the relative energy of the battery whose electrolyte contains the porphyrins. The results indicate that the energy of Li/SOCl2 battery catalyzed by porphyrins 3a and 3b is 101, 37% higher, respectively, than that of Li/SOCl2 battery in the absence of the porphyrins. It can be used as a basis for the synthesis of more porphyrins with improved catalytic activity to Li/SOCl2 battery in the future. Graphical abstract Keywords Porphyrin Catalytic activity Li/SOCl2 battery Relative energy 1 Introduction Lithium/thionyl chloride (Li/SOCl2) battery are considered promising power sources because of their high energy density, high operation voltage, long storage life and wide operation temperature range [1–5]. However, the energy of Li/SOCl2 battery in practice is much lower than that in theory, which severely prohibits its wide application [6]. In addition, Li/SOCl2 battery is mainly used as the primary battery to supply the power to the instruments operated in long time and in the rough-weather research, which makes the improvement of the practical energy of Li/SOCl2 battery increasingly urgent. It has been reported that metal phthalocyanines can improve the performance of Li/SOCl2 battery [6–11]. Considering porphyrin derivatives have similar structure of phthalocyanine derivatives, high conjugated structure, good thermal stability, excellent electron conductivity and better solubility [15,16], therefore, the porphyrin derivatives are applied in Li/SOCl2 battery system to expect to improve its discharge voltage and battery energy. However, to the best of our knowledge, only a few works have demonstrated the catalytic activity of metal porphyrins to Li/SOCl2 battery [12–14], and about the catalytic performance of metal-free porphyrins to Li/SOCl2 battery have not be reported. Furthermore, metal-free porphyrins are much more environmental compatible compared with metal phthalocyanines and metal porphyrins. Herein we report the synthesis, characterization of two metal-free porphyrins and their catalytic activity to Li/SOCl2 battery. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and reagents LiAlCl4/SOCl2 electrolyte (The concentration of LiAlCl4 is 1.47mol·L−1), lithium pieces and carbon films were provided by Xi'an Institute of Electromechanical Information Technology, and other reagents were purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagents Company. All solvents and reagents were used without further purification except pyrrole and DMF were distilled before using. 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-10,15,20-triphenyl porphyrin (1a) was synthesized according to literature [17]. All chromatographic separations were carried out on silica gel (100–120 mesh). 2.2 Characterizations 1H NMR spectra were recorded by using a Varian Inova 400MHz apparatus at room temperature; CDCl3 was used as solvent and tetra-methylsilane (TMS) for reference. Elemental analyses (C, H and N) were performed by Vario EL-III CHNOS instrument. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a BEQUZNDX-550 spectrometer on samples embedded in KBr pellets. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis were carried out on a matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS, Krato Analytical Company of Shimadzu Biotech, Manchester, Britain). UV–vis spectra were measured on a Shimadzu UV 1800 UV–vis-NIR spectrophotometer. 2.3 Synthesis The synthetic routes to the two metal-free porphyrins are shown in Scheme 1 . The detailed synthetic procedures were as follows. 2.3.1 5-(4-(2-bromoethoxyl)phenyl)-10,15,20-triphenyl porphyrin (2a) In a 50mL three-necked flask, potassium carbonate (0.40g, 2.89mmol) and 1,2-dibromoethane (0.83mL, 9.60mmol) were dissolved in 10mL dry DMF, then 1a (0.20g, 0.32mmol) in 5mL DMF was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was stirred for 8h under nitrogen atmosphere at 80°C. Finally, the solvent was evaporated under vacuum, and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with CH2Cl2 as eluent, a purple solid of compound 2a was obtained. Yield: 60%. Mp>250°C, Anal. Calcd (found) for C46H33BrN4O (Mol.Wt:737.6), %: C, 74.93 (74.90); H, 4.58 (4.51); N, 7.61 (7.59). MS: m/z 737.38 (calcd. for [M+H]+ amu). UV–vis (CH2Cl2): λmax/nm, 418 (Soret band), 516, 551, 589, 646 (Q bands). 2.3.2 5-(4-(4-bromobutoxyl)phenyl)-10,15,20-triphenyl porphyrin (2b) The synthetic procedure for 2b was similar to that described for 2a, except that 1,4-dibromobutane (1.16mL, 9.60mmol) was used instead of 1,2-dibromoethane. A purple solid of compound 2b was obtained. Yield: 57%. Mp>250°C, Anal.Calcd (found) for C48H37BrN4O (Mol.Wt:764.2), %: C, 75.34 (75.29); H, 4.83(4.87); N, 7.36(7.32). MS: m/z 765.31 (calcd. for [M+H]+ amu). UV–vis (CH2Cl2): λmax/nm, 417.5 (Soret band), 515.5, 551, 591, 646.5 (Q bands). 2.3.3 5-[4-(2-imidazoleyl)-ethoxyl]phenyl-10,15,20-triphenyl porphyrin (3a) In a 50mL three-necked flask, a mixture of 2a (0.10g, 0.13mmol), anhydrous K2CO3 (0.50g, 3.60mmol) and imidazole (0.90g, 13mmol) in a solution of 15mL dry DMF was stirred for 24h at room temperature. The process of the reaction was monitored by TLC. After the reaction completed, the unreacted solid salt was filtered and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The crude product was washed with water, and purified by column chromatography on silica gel using CHCl3 first and then CHCl3: CH3CH2OH=10: 1 (V:V) as eluent.

The compartment of the cells is made from PTFE material. Carbon films were used as cathode with the apparent area of 1cm2, and lithium pieces were used as the counter electrodes. 1mL LiAlCl4/SOCl2 electrolyte solution containing 2mg metal-free porphyrins was used. The discharge tests for the Li/SOCl2 batteries were evaluated at a constant resistance 40Ω, and were stopped when the voltage reached 2V. All the experiments were implemented in a glove box under an argon atmosphere (MBRAUN, MB-BL-01). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis of the porphyrins The synthetic routes of the metal-free porphyrins 3a and 3b were illustrated in Scheme 1. The porphyrins 2a and 2b were obtained by displacement reaction of 1,2-dibromoethane and 1,4-dibromobutane with 1a in DMF respectively. Followed, the porphyrins 3a and 3b were synthesized by using porphyrins 2a and 2b reacting with imidazole in DMF in the presence of K2CO3 respectively. The UV–vis spectra of the porphyrin 3a consist of a Soret band at 417nm, and the Q bands at 515, 550, 590 and 646nm. The Soret band for porphyrin 3b appears at 419nm and the Q bands at 516, 552, 592 and 646nm. Simultaneously the 1H NMR spectra of porphyrins 3a and 3b were consistent with the structures respectively. The mass spectra of the porphyrins 3a and 3b showed the positively charged [M+H]+ m/z adducts. These spectroscopy data are well identical with the structures of the synthesized porphyrins (Fig. 1 ). 3.2 Catalytic activity Fig. 2 . shows the typical discharge curves measured on the pure carbon electrode. It can be readily seen that the performance of Li/SOCl2 battery catalyzed by metal-free porphyrins is much higher than that of Li/SOCl2 battery in the absence of the porphyrins. The battery's discharge time is 15min for 3a and 12min for 3b longer than that of Li/SOCl2 battery in the absence of porphyrins. And the discharge time of Li/SOCl2 battery catalyzed by metal phthalocyanines is lengthened 6–12min [6,8]. It is indicated that the catalytic activity of the metal-free porphyrins to Li/SOCl2 battery is higher than that of metal phthalocyanines. In order to explain the catalytic activity of the compounds to Li/SOCl2 battery, the relative energy of Li/SOCl2 battery was calculated as follows: The average discharge voltage of Li/SOCl2 battery is (1) U av = ∑ UΔt ∑ Δt The energy of Li/SOCl2 battery is (2) E = ∫ Pdt = ∫ U 2 R e dt = 1 R e ∑ U 2 Δt The relative energy (X) of the battery is (3) X % = E E 0 × 100 In which P stands for the power of the battery, Re stands for the external resistance, U stands for the discharge voltage, t stands for the discharged time, E stands for the energy of the battery. E 0 stands for the energy of the battery in the absence of complexes. The relative energy of Li/SOCl2 battery reflects the catalytic activity of the porphyrins (as shown in Fig. 3 .). It shows that the relative energy of Li/SOCl2 battery catalyzed by porphyrin derivatives 3a and 3b is 37, 101% higher, respectively, than that of Li/SOCl2 battery in the absence of porphyrins. The mechanisms of Li/SOCl2 battery catalyzed by metal phthalocyanines and metal porphyrins have been demonstrated in some papers [8–14]. On the basis of the results, the possible reasons to interpret the excellent results can be proposed. During the discharge of the Li/SOCl2 battery, the electrode reaction of Li/SOCl2 battery is as follows: (4) Li = L i + + e (5) 2 SOC l 2 + 4 e = 4 C l − + S O 2 + S In the above reaction, the Li+ ions around the lithium electrode migrate to the carbon electrode surface and react with the Cl− anion: (6) L i + + C l − = LiCl Due to the low solubility of lithium chloride crystallite in SOCl2 electrolyte, as the discharge goes on, the amount of lithium chloride crystallites deposited on the carbon electrode is increased. It can affect the performance of the battery. In our report, the high energy of Li/SOCl2 battery may due to the rate enhancement of SOCl2 reduction reaction and the retardation deposition of lithium chloride crystallite by adding the metal-free porphyrins to the electrolyte. The detailed mechanisms study on the Li/SOCl2 battery catalyzed by metal-free porphyrins is ongoing in our lab. 4 Conclusion We have synthesized and characterized two metal-free porphyrins to be used as catalysts to Li/SOCl2 battery. The results indicate that the battery's discharge time is 15min for 3a and 12min for 3b longer than that of Li/SOCl2 battery in the absence of porphyrins. Simultaneously the battery's energy is increased 101, 37% respectively. In a word, the metal-free porphyrins show high efficiency as catalysts to Li/SOCl2 battery and it is much more environmental compatibility compared with metal phthalocyanines and metal porphyrins. Therefore, it is worth to do further research on the catalytic activity of metal-free porphyrins to Li/SOCl2 battery.
