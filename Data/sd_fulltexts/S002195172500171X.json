Graphical abstract Inspired by the natural oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II with a cubic Mn4CaO5 cluster, there is relatively little research on photo catalysts that closely resemble the cubic Mn4CaO5 cluster. Therefore, the development of mixed-valence Mn4CaO5 simulacrums has sparked great interest. Herein, we successfully obtained a Mn4O4 cubic cluster with [Mn4(mbm)4(CH3CH2OH)4Br4]·[Mn4(mbm)4(CH3CH2OH)3(H2O)Br4] (Mn4Br) by using MnBr2 and 1-Me-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)methanolate (Hmbm) with its structure determined by single crystal crystallography. The Mn4O4 cubic cores consists of an octahedral Mn(II) center chelated by the alkoxide oxygen and imidazole nitrogen atoms from monoanionic mbm − and coordinated by alcohol/H2O and bromide ion. Mn4Br was found to exhibit activity for trifluoromethylation reaction under visible light. The oxidization of Mn4Br under I2 solution led to the formation of mix-valent Mn4Br-I2 with smallest sizes, which exhibited improved much higher activity for the C–H activated trifluoromethylation reaction due to the much higher redox performance as well as a lower charge-transfer resistance. This study provides a new and efficient strategy for the synthesis of Mn4CaO4 simulacrum structures with mixed valent states and develops its application in photocatalytic organic synthesis.

Trifluoromethylation, as an important C-F bond-forming reaction, has become particularly significant in pharmaceutical chemistry and materials science due to its key applications [6–8]. This is primarily because the introduction of a trifluoromethyl group can significantly alter the physicochemical properties of molecules, such as lipophilicity, metabolic stability, and biological activity. However, traditional methods for trifluoromethylation suffer from high costs, harsh conditions, and the generation of numerous by-products, which limit their application in organic synthesis [9–11]. Therefore, the development of new, efficient photo catalysts to achieve trifluoromethylation under mild conditions is of great scientific and practical significance. Photosynthesis in nature is an efficient energy conversion process, in which the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of Photosystem II (PS II) is responsible for catalysing the oxidation of water to release oxygen [12]. This process involves a complex four-electron oxidation process and is currently one of the most efficient known natural photocatalytic reactions. The structure and function of the OEC, which has evolved over billions of years in nature. It is a masterpiece of precise atomic arrangement and electronic structure, enabling efficient water oxidation under mild conditions [13,14]. For instance, C. Zhang and co-workers successfully predicted the binding mode of the key auxiliary Ca2+ in the biological OEC [15]. Then, they first artificially synthesized a biomimetic Mn4CaO5 cluster compound that is structurally and functionally similar to the biological OEC [16]. Subsequently, they further prepared a biomimetic Mn4CaO5 cluster compound closer to the biological OEC by replacing peripheral ligands [17]. However, these OEC structures are less stable, particularly with the Ca2+ ion prone to dissociation [18,19]. Inspired by the structure and function of the OEC, tetrametallic molecular water oxidation catalysts, especially M4O4 cubane-like clusters (M = transition metals), have sparked great interest in developing highly active and robust catalysts for water oxidation, with the aim of replicating their efficient catalytic performance in various catalytic reactions [20–23]. G.R. Patzke and co-workers reported a Co4/CoxNi4-xO4 cubane structure that serves as a stable water oxidation photo catalyst for photocatalytic oxygen evolution reactions [24]. X. Wang and co-workers developed an effective and stable molecular co-catalyst Co4O4 to promote photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production [25]. L. Wu and co-workers found that the multi-electron redox properties of the cubane Cu4O4 may be favourable for activating catalytic cycles for water oxidation [26]. Although M4O4 photo catalysts have made certain progress in mimicking the OEC, they still face many challenges in photocatalytic organic synthesis applications, including the efficiency of photo generated charge separation, the stability of the catalysts, and the selectivity of the reactions [27–30]. Therefore, gaining a deep understanding of the reaction principles of M4O4 photo catalysts in photocatalytic organic synthesis and optimizing their structure to improve photocatalytic performance is of great importance for advancing the practical application of photocatalytic redox reactions. Herein, we synthesized a cubane Mn4O4 structure ([Mn4(mbm)4(CH3CH2OH)4Br4]·[Mn4(mbm)4(CH3CH2OH)3(H2O)Br4], Mn4Br) under 140 °C conditions. The cubane Mn4O4 revealed that the core contained an octahedral Mn(II) center chelated by the alkoxide oxygen and imidazole nitrogen atoms from the monoanionic mbm – ligand, and coordinated by CH3CH2OH/H2O molecules and Br– ions. In the trifluoromethylation reaction, Mn4Br exhibits significant activity under visible light, which demonstrated its potential as a photocatalyst. Furthermore, the oxidation of Mn4Br in an I2 solution led to the formation of mix-valent Mn4Br-I2 with smaller sizes, which exhibited markedly improved activity for C–H activated trifluoromethylation reactions. This enhancement is attributed to the significantly higher redox performance and lower charge-transfer resistance of the mix-valent Mn4Br-I2 cubane, which closer to high valent Mn ions of the biological OEC. The development of this novel photo catalyst not only provides insights into the structure–activity relationships of Mn4CaO5 simulacra but also paves the way for their application in photocatalytic organic synthesis. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparations Synthesis of Mn4Br. 198 mg MnBr2 (1 mmol), 162 mg Hmbm ligand (1 mmol) and 50 μL triethylamine were dissolved in a 15 mL reaction kettle containing 8 mL CH3CH2OH. Then, the reaction kettle was heated at 140 °C for 48 h. After that, the reaction kettle was cooled to room temperature. Faint yellow nubby crystals of Mn4Br were obtained with a yield of 85 %. Preparation of Mn4Br-I2 . 100 mg Mn4Br (200 mg) was added in 20 mL CH3CH2OH solution containing 100 mg I2 for 12 h at room temperature. Then, the solid washed by CH3CH2OH until the CH3CH2OH was colorless. The resultant brown powder was obtained by centrifugation and was dried to obtain Mn4Br-I2 , with a yield of 85 %. 2.2 Light initiated trifluoromethylation reaction The photocatalytic trifluoromethylation reactions were reacted in a 20 mL sealed Schlenk tube, which irradiated under a 30 W white LED lamp. In the Schlenk tube, 5 mg photocatalyst, 0.2 mmol arenes and 0.3 mmol CF3SO2Na and 2 mL CH3CH2OH was added into the Schlenk tube under air atmosphere. When the reaction finished, the mixed reaction liquid was filtered. The reaction products was detected by GC–MS and quantitatively analyzed using 19F NMR (2,2,2-trifyoroethanol as the internal standard). 2.3 Characterizations The Hmbm ligand was synthesized by literature [31]. The synthesis procedure of Hmbm ligand had been added in Supporting Information. The details of the characterizations, the single-crystal X-ray crystallography of Mn4Br and the NMR data of the products were provided in the supporting information. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Crystal and chemical structure Giant yellow dodecahedral Mn4Br crystal with cubic structure was obtained by hydrothermal condition. The crystal structures are shown in Fig. 1 and listed in Table S1. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicate that Mn4Br crystallizes in the tetragonal P42/n space group, which contained eight Mn(II) ions, eight mbm − ligands, eight coordinated Br− anions, seven coordinated CH3CH2OH molecules and one coordinated H2O molecule (Fig. 1a and Table S2). So the molecular formula is [Mn4(mbm)4(CH3CH2OH)4Br4]·[Mn4(mbm)4(CH3CH2OH)3(H2O)Br4] (Mn4Br). Between Mn(II) ions and mbm − ligands, the bond length distances of Mn-O are within the limits of 2.140 (4)–2.273 (4) Å, the bond length distances of Mn-N are within the limits of 2.187 (5)–2.208 (5) Å. The bond length distances of Mn-Br are within the limits of 2.5851 (11)–2.6209 (11) Å. The bond length distances of Mn-O between Mn(II) ions and CH3CH2OH molecules are within the limits of 2.228 (4)–2.295 (4) Å. And the bond length distance of Mn-O between Mn(II) ion and H2O molecule is 2.239 (5) Å (Table S2). The periphery of the structure is protected by mbm − ligands, coordinated solvents, and coordinated Br− anions, with two Mn4O4 cores at the center (Fig. 1b). The Mn4Br structure possesses a cubane-like architecture similar to the OEC framework, with Mn(III) ions in the OEC framework contributing to its high redox activity. Considering that all Mn ions in the Mn4Br structure are +2 valences, an attempt is made to oxidize the Mn(II) ions to higher valent Mn ions without disrupting the Mn4Br structure using a mild oxidant [32]. I2 is selected as the oxidizing agent, it is dissolved in anhydrous CH3CH2OH by shaking, and then Mn4Br crystals are added to the I2-CH3CH2OH solution [33]. After allowing the mixture to stand for 12 h, the crystals are filtered out and rinsed with small amounts of anhydrous CH3CH2OH repeatedly until the ethanol solution is essentially colorless. Finally, the solid is dried at 60 °C, and the resulting sample is named Mn4Br-I2 . The field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of Mn4Br material show that it has nubby shape with a width exceeding 10 μm (Fig. 2 a). Both FE-SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveal that Mn4Br-I2 have dimensions less than 50 nm (Fig. 2b and c). Furthermore, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental mapping analysis of Mn4Br-I2 confirms the presence of C, N, O, Mn (Fig. 2d) and Br− (Fig. S1). Following iodine oxidation treatment, no iodine was detected in the sample after ethanol washing, confirming that the oxidized material is essentially devoid of iodine species (Fig. S2). This analysis indicates that the nanoparticles maintain the same chemical composition as the original material, aligning with the expected crystal structure. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of both Mn4Br and Mn4Br-I2 exhibit the same characteristic diffraction peaks, which can attribute to the simulated pattern (Fig. 3 a). N2 adsorption at 77 K was employed to investigate the porosity changes in cubane materials following the application of the PSP strategy. Both Mn4Br and Mn4Br-I2 show typical H1 type adsorption isotherms with 47.15 and 116.43 m2/g for Mn4Br and Mn4Br-I2 , indicating their microporous characteristics (Fig. 3b). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the Mn 2p region clearly indicated that the peaks at 641.1 and 653.2 eV can be assigned to Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 of Mn(II) for Mn4Br, and the peaks at 643.4 and 654.3 eV can be assigned to Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 of Mn(II) for Mn4Br-I2 (Fig. 3c). The peaks at 646.5 and 646.7 eV can be assigned to satellite peak, which exhibit that the samples have Mn(II) ion. The XPS spectra in Mn3s region of Mn4Br and Mn4Br-I2 show that the peak ranges (ΔE) of Mn3s spectra are 6.1 and 5.7 eV, which are assigned to Mn(II) ions for Mn4Br, Mn(II)/Mn(III) mix-valent ions for Mn4Br-I2 (Fig. 3d) [32]. All these results indicted the successful synthesis of all samples. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), a fundamental electrochemical characterization technique, provides critical insights into redox reversibility, charge transfer kinetics, and surface-confined electrochemical processes within functional materials. As shown in Fig. S3, the CV profiles of the Mn4Br and Mn4Br-I2 exhibits well-defined anodic/cathodic peaks, indicative of the Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couple activation. The diminished oxidation peak potential of Mn4Br-I2 (Fig. S3) reveals accelerated oxidation kinetics mediated by Mn3+ ions, which enable reactant oxidation at lower overpotentials. This electrochemical behaviour corroborates the dominance of highly oxidative Mn3+ species in the sample. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the Mn4Br showed broad light absorption in the range of 200–680 nm while Mn4Br-I2 exhibited enhanced absorption ranging from 200 to 1100 nm (Fig. 4 a) [34]. According to the Tauc plot, the band gap (E g) of Mn4Br and Mn4Br-I2 are 3.06 and 1.73 eV (Fig. 4b). Valence band XPS (VB-XPS) measurements showed that values of the valence band potential energy (EVB-XPS ) are 2.17 eV and 1.67 eV (Fig. 4c). The calculated positions of the valence band are 2.04 eV and 1.38 eV according to the equation EVB-NHE = φ + EVB-XPS − 4.44. Therefore, the conduction bands (CB) position of Mn4Br and Mn4Br-I2 are −1.02 and −0.35 eV according to the equation E CB = E VB − E g (Fig. 4d). The VB position of the samples indicated higher VB positions (1.38 eV) than the lowest potential to obtain •CF3 radicals from CF3SO2Na (1.24 eV), which has the potential in driving the trifluoromethylation reaction via the •CF3 substitution process [34–37]. The result indicated that once employing all samples as the photo catalysts [38], the trifluoromethylation reaction can be initiate under light excitation. Considering that CF3-containing building blocks play an important role in the production of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and specialty materials, the preparation of trifluoromethyl (TFM) compounds in the mild and effective manner is of great interesting. 3.2 Photocatalytic properties When Mn4Br was used in the trifluoromethylation reaction of benzene with CF3SO2Na as the −CF3 source, the reaction could take place and afforded 42.5 % yield of benzotrifluoride (3a) product under white LED light irradiation (Table 1 , entry 3). Once perform the reaction under dark or 80 °C conditions, the reaction could not take place (Table 1, entries 4 and 5). MnBr2 could also drive the transformation of benzene to 3a with yield of 5 %, indicating that the Mn2+ may serve as the active sites during the reaction (Table 1, entry 1). When we used Hmbm ligands, no 3a product can be observed (Table 1, entry 2). These results suggested that the photo-active Mn4Br and the incident light played crucial role in driving the trifluoromethylation reaction. Compared with Mn4Br, Mn4Br-I2 gave higher 3a yield (83.5 %, Table 1, entry 6). The turnover numbers of all photo catalysts were the same as the yields. The increased activity in the Mn4Br-I2 sample may attribute to the mix valent Mn(II)/Mn(III) ions with higher redox activity and enlarged surface area exposing more active centers to facilitate the adsorption and photocatalytic conversion of substrate molecules. The influence of solvents and amount of incident photons on the trifluoromethylation reaction was also investigated. As can be seen in Fig. S4a, other solvents such as DMF, CH3CN, acetone and DMSO could also promote the reaction and gave slightly lower 3a yield than that of CH3CH2OH over Mn4Br and Mn4Br-I2 . In the case of CH2Cl2, no 3a can be detected. The amount of 3a linearly increased with the prolonged irradiation time (Fig. S4b), and the highest 3a yield can reach to 90 % after 15 h reaction. The optimized photo catalysts amount is 2 μmol (Fig. S4c). After 5 cycles reaction, no obvious decrease on the 3a yield can be observed, indicating the good stability of the photo catalysts (Fig. S4d). To make a clear understanding on the structure–activity of the clusters in the trifluoromethylation reactions, the photoelectric properties, optical performance and band structures of the samples are tested. Given that the efficiency of charge separation in photo catalysts significantly impacts photocatalytic performance, the samples were assessed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), time-resolved fluorescence decay, and photocurrent measurements to compare their charge separation efficiencies. The longer fluorescence lifetime of Mn4Br-I2 (7.3 ps) was observed in the transient fluorescence lifetime decay curve, suggesting that the nonradiative lifetime of Mn4Br-I2 increased revealing an effective interfacial charge transfer process (Fig. 5 a). Lower intensity of PL peak of Mn4Br-I2 suggested that it has lower charge-transfer resistance (Fig. 5b). Among EIS and photocurrent intensity of all the photo catalysts exhibited that Mn4Br-I2 showed smaller Nyquist curve radius and higher photocurrent intensity, once more suggesting the improved charge separation efficiency (Fig. 5c and d). Under the optimized reaction conditions, the substrates including different six-membered arenes or drugs containing benzene was used to explore the universality of the photocatalytic method. As shown in Table 2 , whether the six-membered arenes bearing electron withdrawing or electron donating group, the reaction can take place smoothly and moderate to good target trifluoromethylation product can be obtained. In drug molecules, heterocyclic compounds containing N, O or Cl/F elements can also be activated and gave desired final products. Moreover, during the reaction, several bioactive drug candidates which possess different functional groups can be obtained in the presence of clusters photo catalyst. These results indicated that this photocatalytic system exhibited good tolerance for different arene/alkane substrates. To delve deeper into the active species involved in the reaction, experiments involving radical and electron trapping were conducted. When benzoquinone (BQ), EDTA-disodium (EDTA-2Na) and isopropanol (IPA) was used as the radical, e− and hole scavenger, respectively, a detectable trace yield of 3a was observed. This suggests that the photogenerated radicals, e−, and holes are the active species in the reaction. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was utilized to verify the production of free radicals. The introduction of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a trapping agent enabled the detection of superoxide anion (O2•−) in the presence of Mn4Br and Mn4Br-I2 , which substantiates the role of the O2•− during the reaction (Fig. 6 a). As evidenced EPR spectra with mixture (2-methyl-2- nitrosopropane (MNP) as the •CF3 radical trapping agent, the singlet–triplet splitting signal attributing to MNP-CF3• adducts can be observed at g = 2.0061 (ɑN = ɑF = 12.25 G), in the presence of Mn4Br and Mn4Br-I2 (Fig. 6b) [11,37]. Drawing from the experimental findings and existing reports, a plausible mechanism for the trifluoromethylation reaction has been proposed [37,39–41]. Under the light irradiation, the valence band of Mn4Br-I2 generates a hole that oxidizes CF3SO2Na to form the •CF3 radical, which is the initiation step of the reaction. Subsequently, the electron-deficient CF3• selectively attacks (hetero)arenes to produce the key intermediate of trifluoromethyl-cyclohexadienyl radical. Ultimately, this intermediate undergoes oxidation by the separated hole, leading to the formation of benzotrifluoride as the final product after the cationic intermediate loses a proton (Fig. 6c). The final chemical state of S and C elements in CF3SO2Na was also be investigated via analysing the gas phase reaction mixture by GC–MS and ion chromatography. SO2 and CO2 were detected in the GC–MS spectra of the gas product while none of them were found in the absence of CF3SO2Na. In addition, SO4 2− was detected in the ion chromatography of the reaction mixture (Fig. 6d). It is noteworthy that even acidic SO2 product was generated during the reaction, the Mn4Br and Mn4Br-I2 could retain the original structure and exhibited high activity after recycled reactions. All these results suggested that the photo catalysts possess good acid resistance during the redox reactions. The field of photocatalytic aromatic trifluoromethylation has predominantly focused on metal salts [6,39], semiconductors [10,11], and MOFs [34–37], with scarce reports on coordination clusters, like Bi- [41], Cu- [42], and Fe-cluster [43]. Cubane-type M4O4 photo catalysts emerge as paradigm-shifting candidates, whose well-defined structures enable unprecedented mechanistic dissection of multi-metal redox cooperativity in C–CF3 bond formation. 4 Conclusion In summary, we successfully obtained a cubic Mn4O4 bio-inspired structure under solvothermal condition. The cubic Mn4O4 cores are structurally similar to the oxygen-evolving centre Mn4CaO5 cluster in PS II, which show general photocatalytic trifluoromethylation activity. After partial Mn(II) ions in Mn4O4 cores are oxidized to Mn(III) ions, they exhibit efficient photocatalytic trifluoromethylation performance. The high performance may be mainly attributed to the high redox activity of the partial Mn(III) ions in the tetranuclear Mn4O4 cubane centre. This is the first set of cubic manganese-based photo catalysts for trifluoromethylation reaction. It is anticipated that this example will stimulate research on Mn4CaO5 analogs and the design of more active photo-redox catalysts.

        "dc:description": "Inspired by the natural oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II with a cubic Mn4CaO5 cluster, there is relatively little research on photo catalysts that closely resemble the cubic Mn4CaO5 cluster. Therefore, the development of mixed-valence Mn4CaO5 simulacrums has sparked great interest. Herein, we successfully obtained a Mn4O4 cubic cluster with [Mn4(mbm)4(CH3CH2OH)4Br4]·[Mn4(mbm)4(CH3CH2OH)3(H2O)Br4] (Mn4Br) by using MnBr2 and 1-Me-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)methanolate (Hmbm) with its structure determined by single crystal crystallography. The Mn4O4 cubic cores consists of an octahedral Mn(II) center chelated by the alkoxide oxygen and imidazole nitrogen atoms from monoanionic mbm − and coordinated by alcohol/H2O and bromide ion. Mn4Br was found to exhibit activity for trifluoromethylation reaction under visible light. The oxidization of Mn4Br under I2 solution led to the formation of mix-valent Mn4Br-I2 with smallest sizes, which exhibited improved much higher activity for the C–H activated trifluoromethylation reaction due to the much higher redox performance as well as a lower charge-transfer resistance. This study provides a new and efficient strategy for the synthesis of Mn4CaO4 simulacrum structures with mixed valent states and develops its application in photocatalytic organic synthesis.",
