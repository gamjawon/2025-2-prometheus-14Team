THEIR APPLICATION AS CATALYSTS FOR DIHYDROGEN EVOLUTION E. R. SAVINOVA, E. N. SAVINOV and V. N. PARMON Institute of Catalysis, Novosibirsk 630090 (U.S.S.R.) (Received September 10,1987; accepted March 10,1988) Summary The kinetics of catalytic dihydrogen evolution from acidic aqueous solutions of strong one-electron reductants Vaq24\" and the cation radical of methylviologen (MV\"1\") in the presence of polymer-stabilized copper colloids was studied. This process could be described quantitatively in the framework of an electrochemical 'microelectrode' model. The standard heterogeneous rate constant of proton reduction on finely dispersed copper was determined, its value being found to drop sharply when the size of copper particles decreases from 150 to 25 A. The possibility of applying other non-noble metals, e.g. cobalt, as H; evolution catalysts is discussed. Introduction Numerous studies of the catalytic dihydrogen evolution on colloids of noble metals in the presence of strong one-electron reductants A~ via the reaction: . colloid A- + H-*- > A + Y2H2 (A) carried out in the past 10-15 years have shown that in this process the colloids behave like bulk electrodes at the cathodic evolution of H;. For this reason colloidal particles were called microelectrodes. Two electrochemical reactions are assumed to occur simultaneously on the surface of microelectrodes: A\" ?=^ A + es H* + e, ;=^ Y2H2 (1) (2) McLendon et al. have suggested the so-called 'microelectrode' model [1, 2] that describes the process (A) in terms of electrochemical kinetics based on the concept of a mixed potential. 0304-5102/88/$3.60 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 232 In this work, experimental results that confirm and specify postulates of the 'microelectrode' model are reported. Also, data on the process of dihydrogen evolution on copper colloids, the influence of the particle size of such colloids on their catalytic activity, as well as the possibility of applying other non-noble metals as H; evolution catalysts are considered. Experimental Copper colloids were prepared by reducing CuSC>4 solutions in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVPR) with the aid of BH4~ anions (colloids 1 - 6 in Table 1) or [SiWi^o]5\" (colloid 7 in the same Table) at 295 2 K in argon atmosphere (for more details see Experimental in [3]). In experiments on the influence of the particle size of copper colloids on their catalytic activity in order to avoid additional effects, colloid solutions containing the same compounds in equal concentrations should be used. For this reason colloids 1-6 (see Table 1) were obtained based on the same TABLE 1 Conditions of preparation of copper colloids of different size No of colloid Preparation conditions Size of colloidal particles formed (A) [2.5 X 10-5 mol CuS04] [2.5 X10-5 mol NaBH4] in 5 ml H^O) + 5 X 10-4 mol PVPR + in 45 ml H^O \\ the same as in (1) except that a NaBH4 solution was introduced more slowly the same as in (2) except that a NaBH4 solution was introduced more slowly 5 ml (3) + 1.5 X 10-5 mol CuS04 + 3 X 10-4 mol PVPR + 27 ml HzO 1.5 X 10-5 mol NaBH4 in 3 ml H^O 2 ml (3) + 2 X 10-5 mol CuS04 + 4 X 10-4 mol PVPR + 34 ml HiO 2 X 10-5 mol NaBH4 in 4 ml HzO 1ml (5) + 4 X 10~5 mol CuS04 + 8 X 10-4 mol PVPR + 75 ml HzO 4 X 10-5 mol NaBH4 in 4 ml H^O 10-4 mol CuS04 1 + 2 X 10-3 mol PVPR + 48.5 ml HaO J [1.5 X10-4 mol] + [SiWi204o]5- | Lin 1.5 mlH;0 - <ds> = 25 <ds> = 30 <ds> = 35 <d>=44 W = 52 <d>=47 <d,> = 59 <d> = 64 <ds> = 176 <d> = 200 <ds> = 250 233 starting solutions. The size of the colloidal particles was controlled either by varying the rate of introduction of the NaBH4 solution into the CuS04 solu- tion (colloids 1 - 3) or by breaking the process of colloid preparation into two steps (colloids 4 - 6). The first step was preparation of a highly dispersed colloid, and the second was increasing the size of primary small particles by introduction of additional copper sulfate and sodium borohydride into the colloidal copper solution. The method described is a modification of the earlier proposed method of preparation of Au colloid particles [4]. Cobalt colloids were obtained by reduction of a 5 X 1CT4 M aqueous solution of Cod; with a freshly prepared solution of NaBH4 (5 X 10~4 M) in the presence of polyvinylalcohol (10~2 M) at 298 K in argon. The size of the colloidal particles was determined by electron micros- copy [3]. As a characteristic size we used values of an average <d> and a surface-averaged (root-mean-square) particle diameter <ds>, which were calcu- lated from the curves of particle size distribution <d> = 2 \"(d,-/ 2 \",; <ds> = (S \"(d(2/ \",) > I \\ i i J 1/2 where rii is the number of particles with diameter d,. VSC>4 was obtained by reduction of a VOS04 (A.P.) solution acidified with H2SC>4 over amalgamated zinc in argon atmosphere. A solution of the radical cation, methylviologen (MV4\"), was prepared by reduction of a 1CT2 M solution of MVCl; (A.P.) for 2 - 3 h on a mercury cathode at a potential of 800 mV relative to the silver chloride electrode. Dihydrogen evolution via reaction (A) with A~ = Vaq2\"*\" or MV'1\" was effected in a vessel which had been bubbled and filled with argon. The reductant A~ and the colloid were injected into the vessel by a syringe. The amount of dihydrogen produced was determined by gas chromatography using an LKhM-8MD (USSR) chromatograph. The catalytic activity of the samples was determined from the initial rate of dihydrogen evolution, v, from a 2 X 10~3 M solution of the reductant at 298 K. The amount of the catalyst was 5 X 10\"7 g-atom dm\"3 calculated per metal. The pH of the solution was varied by adding H2SC>4; an ionic strength was maintained constant (4 M) by introduction of calculated amounts of NaaSO^. The maximum achievable rate of V2\"*\" oxidation on the surface of colloid particles was determined at pH 0. Variations in the V2\"*\" concentrations were registered by measuring the limiting anodic current on a platinum electrode with a small area at a potential of +280 mV relative to the normal hydrogen electrode. The potential was maintained constant with the aid of an EP-21 (Poland) potentiostat. Electroconductivity measurements were made by an OK 102/1 Radelkis conductometer (Hungary) with a bell-shaped electrode. To determine the electrochemical cell constant, 1, 0.1 and 0.01 N solutions of KC1 (C.P.) were used. Current-voltage curves of H; evolution, V2'1\" and MV*\" oxidation and MB2\"1' reduction were registered with the help of an EP-21 potentiostat 234 (Poland) in the three-electrode cell with a Pt, Pd or Hg pool working elec- trode, a Pt auxiliary electrode and the silver chloride reference electrode. The electrode potential was scanned with the aid of an LP7 polarograph (Czechoslovakia) and checked by a V7-16A digital voltmeter (USSR). Current-voltage curves were recorded by a two-coordinate recorder NE-240 (Hungary). Below the potentials are given relative to the normal hydrogen electrode. Results and discussion Analysis of the 'microelectrode' model of dihydrogen evolution on metals The 'microelectrode' model in the form developed by McLendon can- not be applied to the quantitative description of the catalytic dihydrogen evolution for a broad class of metals and reductants, since it takes into account only a single particular situation where the rate-determining step of H; evolution is the reaction of proton discharge on the metal, and the step of A~ oxidation is described by a reversible current-voltage curve for this metal. Meanwhile, the mechanism of cathodic H; evolution is known to depend upon the nature of the metal, the rate-determining step being either proton discharge (Volmer mechanism), or electrochemical desorption of hydrogen atoms (Heyrovsky mechanism) or recombination of hydrogen atoms on the metal suface (Tafel mechanism). In the two former cases, the dependence of reaction rate on the electrode potential is the same at a con- stant surface coverage with adsorbed hydrogen atoms. In all equations that 235 Fig. 1. Current-voltage curves for MV'1\" oxidation on the Pd electrode at [MV'1\"] = 2 X 10-2 M, pH 9.2 (1) and MV2\"*' reduction on the Hg electrode at [MV24'] = 10-3 M, pH 7 (2). -200 -100 0 100 200 E,x6 Fig. 2.

Thus, the current-voltage curve of V2'*' oxidation on the Pd elec- trode (Fig. 2) at pH 2.2 in conditions of a noticeable H; evolution (IH ~ 10 JixA cm\"2) had the shape of an irreversible wave with 1/2 0.09 V ^ ^0(v2+/v3-1-) = 0.26 V, whereas according to the literature data fe^+/v3*= 3.6 X 10~3 cm s~1 [5], which corresponds to the reversible wave. In our case, the change in the shape of the current-voltage curve may be associated with the decrease in the observed rate constant of A- discharge, fei due to a significant surface coverage of the Pd electrode with adsorbed hydrogen atoms. In fact, it is known that the rate constants of electrode reactions can change markedly in the presence of specifically adsorbed particles on the electrode surface [6, 7]. Thus, when analysing the principles of catalytic evolution of dihydro- gen for the reductant oxidation step, one must consider the cases of both reversible and irreversible polarographic waves. The consideration of all possible situations for the steps of A~ oxida- tion and H; evolution will allow us to apply the 'microelectrode' model to 236 most currently-used reductants and metals. As is known, on bulk copper cathodes dihydrogen evolution occurs customarily by the Volmer mecha- nism; for this reason this case will be the main subject of our consideration. Case I. The rate-determining step of dihydrogen evolution is the reac- tion of proton discharge (Volmer reaction), and the current-voltage curve of the reductant oxidation is irreversible (fei < 10~4 cm s~1). The rate of reduction of protons will be expressed as: u; = Sfe2 C'H + exp(-a^FE/RT) (3) The rate of oxidation of A~ in the absence of its oxidized state in the initial period of time will be described as [6]: Ui=v^i/{l+exp-(l-a^)F(E-E[^)/RT} (4) where the half-wave potential E 1/2, is .. 2.3-RT mA- ^-^(T^?18^- w The limiting rate of A~ oxidation is expressed as: \"max 1 = SCA-D^-ISA- = SCA-mf,- (6) Assuming that under steady-state conditions the rates of A~ oxidation and dihydrogen evolution are the same, and are equal to the rate of the catalytic reaction, v, and that a^ w a; 0.5, from eqns. (3) and (4) one can find the relation between v and pH: / v2 \\ In )=]nSk.io-2.3pH-FE[^|2RT (7) \\ymax y/ In order to analyse the shape of the dependence of v on pH, we find the derivative: ^--L^-J-J (8) dy 2.3 \\u v^-v] As can be seen for v -> 0, the value dpH/dv -> o ; similarly for v -> Umax the value dpH/du -> . The bending point of the curve is observed at v = 0.58 Umax. where its slope is maximal and equals dpH/du = 2.6/Umax. This analysis allows us to describe in detail the dependence of v on pH which must be observed in this case. Let us define as pHi/z the value of pH at which the rate of H^ evolution achieves half of its maximum value. Then in the range of high pH (pH > pHi/a) the rate of the catalytic evolution of Hz is close to zero. With decreasing pH the rate tends to increase, the change of v from O.lUmax to 0.9umax taking place in the interval ApH 2.6. At pH < pHi/2 the rate reaches the maximum value, Umax which is determined by the rate of diffusion of reductant particles towards the surface of micro- electrodes, and does not change with further pH diminishing. For pHi/2 we obtain 237 a.i - 1 + tto a, pHi/2 = lg 2 + lg fe,0 + Ig fei - - Ig WA- - Ig CA- 1 Q!i 1 tti - ^ (9) 2.3RT Equation (9) indicates that the position of the curve u(pH) on the pH axis depends upon rate constants of discharge ionization for the first and second half-reactions, the electrochemical reducing potential of the reduc- tant, its concentration and mass-transfer coefficient. The shift ApH of the position of pHi/; on changing the electrochemical potential of the reduc- tant, AEi , its mass-transfer coefficient being constant at 298 K is: APH = - ^^ \" -^^ (10) Case II. The rate-determining step of dihydrogen evolution is the proton discharge, and the current-voltage curve for the reductant oxidation is reversible (fei > ICT4 cm s-1). This is the very case that McLendon chose for the description of H; evolution on the Pt colloid in the presence of MV'1\". The rate of A\" oxidation is expressed as: Vi = y,naxi/{l + exp[-F(E-E,^)/RT]} (11) where Em = EI + RT^ m^- ^ Ei0 (12) F WA due to the close values of mass-transfer coefficients of the oxidized and reduced forms of the reagent [6]. The relation between the catalytic reaction rate and pH in this case appears to be: ^/ymax_y\\ ^ FEi /2.3RT- 2 lg Sfe,0 + 2pH (13) \\ y / The derivative under consideration: dpH 1/1 3\\ = _ __ i _____ + _ d4\\ du 4.6^-^ V] From eqn. (14) it follows that for the reversible polarographic wave the dependence of u on pH is steeper than that for the irreversible wave. The maximum slope of the u(pH) curve is observed at v = 0.64Umax, and is equal to (dpH/dy)o.6i,n^ w 1.6/Umax- The slope in the point pHi/a is ca. 1.7/ ^max- y01 pHi/2 one obtains: pHi/2 = lg 2 + lg ft,0 - lg WA-CA- - F i /4.6fiT (15) 238 Thus, for fei > 10~4 cm s~1 the parameter k- is not involved in the expres- sion for pHi/2, and eqn. (15) can be used for the calculation of the hetero- geneous rate constant of proton reduction, ky . The shift of the position of pHi/2 curve with changing reducing potential of A~ is the same as in case I. Along with the limiting cases I and II considered above, an intermediate case where fei ~ 10~4 cm s~1 is also possible. However, analysis of this case is complicated. The rate-determining step of Ha evolution at platinum metal electrodes usually appears to be the Tafel reaction, for which the relation between current density, i, and overvoltage, 17, is given as [8]: RT /i+i'o\\ T^=-2^1n-^J (16) ^P1' \\ h I Here i'o is the density of the exchange current for the heterogeneous chem- ical reaction of recombination of hydrogen atoms; fS is a coefficient which characterizes surface inhomogeneity and which equals unity for the homo- geneous surface and tends to zero with increasing surface inhomogeneity. An analysis of this case indicates that the shape of the u(pH) curve is determined by the ratio between i'o and imaxi as we^ as by the coefficient (S. At i'o ^ imaxf the shape of this curve can be essentially different from that for case I (Table 2). The shift of the u(pH) function upon variation of the electrochemical potential of the reductant in the situation where the rate- determining step is the Tafel reaction, must be twice as high as in cases I and II. Therefore, the dependence of v on the potential of the reductant may be a convenient criterion for the elucidation of the rate-determining step of H; evolution. For the catalytic reduction of water to dihydrogen on platinum metal colloids, the H; evolution step can also be limited by Hz removal from the particle surface into the bulk of the solution. In this case the 1(77) function is similar to (16), with the exception that j3= 1 and i'o is replaced by the limiting diffusion flux of H;. Thus, the consequences will be the same as in cases III and IV (Table 2). It is understood that the analysis made is some- what simplified. Nonetheless, it indicates that the shape of the dependences of the reaction rate, y, on pH and on the electrochemical potential of the reductant change significantly upon variation of the i(E) functions for the catalytic reaction steps, and can be regarded as important criteria for the elucidation of the mechanism of the catalytic reaction on metals. Note that the dependence of the quantum yield V/ of the photocatalytic production of Hz in the presence of the Pt colloid (^ ~ (Ei + 0.059 pH)) found by McLen- don et al. [9] is evidence that the rate-determining step of dihydrogen evolu- tion is, most probably, the recombination of hydrogen atoms, that is, the reaction is described by case IV rather than II, which was proposed earlier in [2]. Experimental study of the catalytic evolution ofHy, on copper colloids Addition of copper colloids to acidic water solutions of V2\"*\" and MV'1\" leads to rapid evolution of dihydrogen via reaction (A), which in the absence 3 IN => ^B 4 I ta- 4 I IM ' W 6- w 6-1 l ..

Due to the established fact that copper can dissolve in acidic media to yield Ha, it should be mentioned that the addition of the reductant to the copper colloid solution accelerates the H; evolution process by more than one order of magnitude. The rate of H; evo- lution assisted by copper colloids depends crucially upon the pH of the solu- tion. At A~ = V2\"*\", the dependence of the initial rate of dihydrogen evolu- tion on the pH is z-shaped (Fig. 3), in accord with the 'microelectrode' model. As is seen, the change in pH, (ApH), which corresponds to the in- crease in the rate of dihydrogen evolution from v ? O.lUmax to v w 0.9ymax does not exceed 1.7 for any copper colloid. 0 1 23 ^i pH Fig. 3. Relative rate of dihydrogen evolution (u/ymax) rs. pH t t copper colloids; (1) A~ = V24-, <ds> = 25 A (coU. No. 1); (2) A- = MV-, (dg) = 26 A (coll. No. 1); (3) A- = V2*, <ds> = 52 A (coll. No. 4). For A~ = MV\"*\" (Fig. 3), the z-shaped dependence of v on pH is shifted towards higher pH relative to that for V2'1\" in such a way that for colloids with the same particle size pHi/a = pHl/2(MV+') pH^/2(V2+) 1.8. For identical colloids the maximum rate of dihydrogen evolution in the presence of V2'1\" is 3.2 times higher than that for MV\"*\". In contrast to V2'1\", on the u(pH) curve for MV\"1\" with decreasing pH in the range pH < 2 a dramatic fall in u, instead of the expected plateau, is observed. This fall is most likely caused by the protonation of the radical cation of methylviologen, resulting in its electrochemically inert form which is not able to promote reduction of water to Hz [10]. The experimental dependence of v on pH for V2\"*\" and MV\"1\" provides evidence that the oxidation of these reductants on copper colloidal particles is reversible, and the catalytic evolution of Hz occurs via case II or IV (Table 2). This seems to be due to the fact that the interaction of copper colloid particles with molecules of the polymer PVPR has little effect on the value of fei , and the surface coverage of hydrogen atoms on finely dispersed copper is low, as on bulk copper [II], especially in the initial time period. To elucidate the nature of the rate-determining step of Ha evolution on copper colloids, let us consider data on the influence of the nature of the reductant on the catalytic reaction rate. The decrease in limiting reaction rate Vmax upon substitution of V2'1\" by MV'1\" at the same concentrations of 241 the reductants could be associated with the difference in mass-transfer coefficients m, (or in other words, diffusion coefficients!),) for these ions. Since we failed to find diffusion coefficients for V2\"*\" and MV\"1\" in the literature, we have estimated them from the electrolytic mobility of these ions, Uj, because according to the Nemst-Einstein equation [12]: Dj = RTu,lq,F (17) The absolute value of electrolytic mobility of MV'1\" is very difficult to determine; for this reason we have estimated UMV^ from the mobility of MV24', taking into account that the electrolytic mobility of the ion is propor- tional to its charge according to the Stocks-Einstein law: u, = \\^\\FI(6vnrjNA) (18) where r, is the radius of the ion, T? is the viscosity of solution and NA is Avo- gadro's number. The electrolytic mobility of MV2\"*\" was found from the value of electrical conductivity of the MVCla^Mvci,) solution by the formula: \"MV^ = (^MvaJF - \"ci-Cci-^CMv\" (19) As found, the electrical conductivity ofa2x 10~2 M solution of MVC^ equals 3.6 X 10-3 Ohm\"1 cm\"1. Using the known value of the electrolytic mobility of the CF anion (uci- = 6.8 X 10~8 m2 V~1 s~1 [13]) we have found UMV\" = 2.6 X 10-8 m2 V-1 s-1. Using equation (19) we obtain UMV^ w ^\"MV^ = 1.3 X 10-8 m2 V~1 s~1 m v s * Having not found the value of mobility for V2'1\" in reference books, we have assumed that ions with close values of radii have approximately the same mobility, and have used for the estimation of Uy\" the known value of mobility for the Ni^ ion (^UNS\" = 4.6 X 10-8 m2 V-1 s-' [13]) because rNi\"=0.74 A rv2+=0.72 A [14]. Thus we obtain D^/D^y sa 4.6 X ICT8/!^ X 10-8 3.5, which is very close to the experimentally observed ratio of the maximum rates of the catalytic Ha evolution for V24\" and MV\"*\"; equal to 3.2. A comparison of the limiting current densities for the oxida- tions of V2* and MV\"*\" on the bulk Pd electrode gives also a close value, imaxtV^/in^MV4-) = 3.6 (Figs. 1 and 2). With the known ratio of mass-transfer coefficients for V2\"1\" and MV\"*\" and the difference of their electrochemical potentials, AE = 0.18 V, it is possible to estimate the shift ApH^ upon substitution of V2\"*\" by MV\"*\" which is theoretically expected within the 'microelectrode' model. As found, this shift would be 3.0 or 2.0 if the Hz evolution occurred via case IV or II, respectively (Table 2). The experimental shift of the u(pH) curve is 1.8, which indicates that the reaction occurs via case II, and the rate-determining step of H; evolution is the Volmer reaction. This mechanism is known to be typical for cathodic Ha evolution on bulk metallic copper electrode. Of principal interest is the possible application of the experimental results under discussion to the determination of the standard heterogeneous 242 rate constant of charge transfer, k^, in the proton reduction (2). Since, as we have already shown, the experimental dependence of v on pH provides evidence that at our conditions the rate constant fei of the A~ oxidation is high (>10~4 cm s~1), fe;0 is not involved in the expression for pHi/2 (see eqn. (15)). Therefore, eqn. (15) can be used for the calculation ofk^ . The main difficulty in the determination of k^ seems to be associated with the estimation of a precise value of the mass-transfer coefficient m^-, because it depends largely upon the method of mixing the reaction system. In our experiments, m^- was maintained constant by carrying out the reaction under identical conditions at a constant rate of mixing. The mass-transfer coefficient for V2\"*\" can be calculated from the maximum achievable rate \"max of V2\"1\" oxidation using eqn. (6). Thus, at [V2\"1\"] = 2 X 10~3 M and an average particle size <ds> = 40 A, y,nax/S = 3 X 10~9 mol V2\"1\" S\"1 cm\"2, which corresponds to m-yi^ 1.5 X 10~3 cm s~1. By then substituting these param- eters into eqn. (15) we obtain: pHi^V2\") = Ig fe,0 + 8.0 (20) The values of k^ for copper colloids of different size calculated using eqn. (20) are tabulated below. Dependence of the catalytic activity of copper colloids on particle size A decrease in the average size of copper particles was found to shift the z-shaped y(pH) curve towards the more acidic region, its shape being unchanged. The dependence of pHi/; on the size of colloidal particles is shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen, with increasing (dg) from 25 to 250 A, the pHi/2 increases and attains its maximum value of 2.75. Note that a further increase of <c?s) has no effect on the pH^;. The most dramatic change in pHi/2 occurs in the region of particle size variation from 20 to 100 A. As <ds> decreases, the total concentration of copper remaining constant, the maximum achievable (i.e. diffusion controlled) rate of dihydrogen evolu- tion, i^maxi on copper colloids increases as a linear function of l/<ds> (Fig. 5), 200 300 <ds>,A Fig. 4.

Plot of i/max ys- l/(dg) during H; evolution from the V2* solution in the presence of copper colloids. in other words, proportionally to the total surface area of microelectrodes, as was expected in accord with eqn. (6). The fact that the shape of the u(pH) dependence remains unchanged when varying the particle size of copper colloids unambiguously indicates that the shape of the i(E) curve for the reductant oxidation is not changed, and has the form of a reversible wave. Thus, we may conclude that the increase in pHi/2 observed by us with increasing (dg) is, most probably, due to the increase in k^0. The estimate made by eqn. (15) shows that k-^ increases by almost 2 orders of magnitude as the particle size increases from 25 to 250 A. ds(A) 25 30 35 52 250 ky (cm s-1) 8.0 X 10-8 2.2 X 10-7 5.0 X 10-7 8.9 X 10~7 5.6 X 10-6 The value of fe;0 determined by us for large copper particles exceeds that for bulk copper electrodes reported in the literature. For example, the exchange current density i'o of dihydrogen evolution on bulk copper is 4 X 10~8 A cm~2 [11]. From this value of i'o, using eqn. (3) and assuming that a = Vs, [H*] = KT3 mol cnT3 and [H;] = 8 X 10~7 mol cm\"3 (solubility of Hz in water at PH, = 1 atm), we find that k^ 1.5 X 10~8 cm s~1. Probably such a low literature value of k^ is due to the fact that the oxide film usually present on the surface of copper electrodes is not always perfectly removed (see e.g. [15]). In the present work, with copper microelectrodes being obtained in a reducing medium in an inert gas atmosphere, their surface could be expected to be less contaminated by oxygen. It is of interest that the dependence of fe;0 on the particle size in the log fe;0 l/<ds) coordinates is almost a straight line (Fig. 6). 244 I, a.u. 10 20 30 W 1/<ds>,10\"'A\"' Fig. 6. Plot of log fez0 ^d intensity of light absorption (I) by copper colloids in the plas- mon region 570 - 590 nm us. l/<i<s)- Thus, large particles of metallic copper correspond to a higher hetero- geneous rate constant of proton reduction. Consequently, such particles are more active catalysts for water reduction to Ha than are smaller particles. On the other hand, the maximum achievable rate of the catalytic process, which is observed in strongly acidic solutions and determined by the diffusion of the particles of the reductant to the microelectrodes, is proportional to the total surface area of colloidal particles. Since this area, in the case of con- stant concentration of the colloid-forming metal, decreases with increasing particle size, in order to prepare the catalysts with the highest specific activ- ity (that is, to ensure the highest rate of the catalytic process at a given con- centration of the colloid-forming metal), one should take into account that there exists an optimum for the size of colloidal particles which depends upon the pH. For copper colloids in the case of Ha evolution from solutions of V2'1\" with pH 2, this optimum is ca. 50 A. Numerous studies published in recent years indicate that structural and electronic properties of small metal particles can essentially differ from those of bulk metal particles (see e.g. [16], [17] and refs. therein). According to our selected area electron diffraction data, all of the copper colloid particles, small and large, have a crystalline structure analogous to that of bulk copper [3]. In this connection one can assume that a sharp drop in the heteroge- neous rate constant of the proton reduction with particle size of copper colloids decreasing below 150 A is associated with changes in their electronic properties. On the other hand, one cannot exclude that the catalytic properties of copper colloidal particles (especially small ones) in H; formation may be significantly affected by non-stoichiometric oxides present on their surfaces [18]. In fact, we found in [3] that decreasing the size of the copper particles enhances their capability of being completely oxidized (up to Cu2*) by water. Therefore, one should anticipate a similar behavior of copper colloidal par- ticles with respect to formation of surface oxides. In this case, the decrease 245 in fe;0 with decreasing size of copper colloids could be associated with an ever-increasing oxidation of their surfaces by water molecules (the volume of the copper particles being unchanged according to the diffraction data). Thus, the dependence of log k^ on l/<ds) can easily be understood: the higher the ratio of particle surface to particle volume the lower fe;0. Possibility of applying other non-noble metals for the catalytic H^ evolution from water Colloids of some other non-noble metals exhibit essentially the same behavior with respect to water reduction to H; as do copper colloids. For example, Fig. 7 illustrates a typical kinetic curve for dihydrogen evolution during water reduction with V2\"*\" on the colloid obtained by reduction of CoCI^ solution with NaBH4 in the presence of polyvinylalcohol. One can see that the amount of dihydrogen evolved equals ca. 40% of the amount expected from the stoichiometry of reaction (A), and exceeds by a factor of 10 the amount of cobalt introduced into the system. Consequently, in this case H; is, indeed, formed as a result of the catalytic reaction (A), rather than dissolution of cobalt in acidic aqueous solution. The fact that the reac- tion stops after incomplete conversion of V2\"*\" to V3\"1' is probably due to the oxidation of the catalyst by protons (pH of the solution 1.35) during the course of the reaction. The activity of cobalt colloids tends to fall with time, probably due to a gradual oxidation of the colloid. To study the chemical nature of the cobalt catalyst, we prepared a special sample via reduction of CoCL; solution with NaBH4 in the absence of stabilizer. The black precipitate produced could easily be dissolved in 0.1 N HC1 with gas evolution, Co24\" formation and was magnetized by a magnetic field. The sample was found to be X-ray amorphous and had the chemical composition 2.38. Small particles of the Co colloid (d ~ 10 - 20 A) were registered with the help of the electron microscope. However, we did not succeed in obtain- 10 20 30 W 50 t, mhi Fig. 7.

Thus, the data obtained do not allow us to define unambiguously the chemical nature of the cobalt catalyst. However, according to the literature data, [19] and refs. therein, the product obtained by the reduction of Co2'1' with BH4~ is most probably a mixture of elemental Co(0) and B(0). Thus, a class of currently available catalysts for water reduction to H; can be significantly broadened via colloids of non-noble metals. Some ex- pected difficulties in the application of non-noble metals such as cobalt seem to be associated with the facts that: (i) due to a low (in comparison with noble metals) heterogeneous rate con- stant of proton reduction, k^ , a high (close to diffusion controlled) reaction rate can be achieved only in strongly acidic media, and (ii) at low pHs most non-noble metals, especially in the finely dispersed state, will be dissolved due to oxidation by protons. Indeed, this latter undesirable phenomenon can be avoided by using stronger reductants, which shift the pHi/; towards a more alkaline region. For example, application of reductants with the standard electrochemical potential 0.8 V, i.e. 0.36 V lower than the standard potential of MV'1\", increases the pH;/; by ca. 3 units. In addition, a sufficiently strong reductant should be able to reduce the metal cations formed during metal dissolution to the zero-valent state, and thus to prevent the catalyst from inactivation via dissolution. Conclusions An analysis of the electrochemical 'microelectrode' model of the cata- lytic evolution of dihydrogen on finely dispersed metals has shown that the shape of the dependence of the reaction rate on pH, namely, its position on the pH axis and its slope, as well as the dependence of the rate on the stan- dard reductant electrochemical potential, are important criteria for determi- nation of the mechanism of the catalytic reduction of water to dihydrogen with one-electron reductants. The peculiarities of this process on copper colloids in the presence of V2'1\" and MV'1\" have been studied. The process can be described quantitatively in the framework of an electrochemical 'micro- electrode' model for the situation, where the rate-determining step of dihy- drogen evolution is the proton discharge, and the current-voltage curve for the reductant oxidation is reversible. The standard heterogeneous rate con- stant for proton reduction on finely dispersed copper has been determined, its value being found to drop when the size of copper particles-microelec- trodes decreases from 150 to 25 A. A rather active colloid catalyst for the reaction of dihydrogen evolution from water has been obtained on the basis of cobalt. This confirms the possible use of various non-noble metals as catalysts for the process under consideration. 247 Acknowledgement The authors are grateful to R. Yu. Beck and V. D.
