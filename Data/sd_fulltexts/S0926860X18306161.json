Graphical abstract Ceria supported Rh catalysts exhibit superior activities for the decomposition of N2O in the presence of water and excess O2 comparing with other oxides supported Rh catalysts. In contrast to Rh/γ-Al2O, hydrothermal aging (750 °C for 20 h with 10% H2O in air) significantly enhances the catalytic activity of Rh/CeO2 for the decomposition of N2O. The presence of H2O, on the other hand, inhibits the reaction rate on all Rh catalysts, but this inhibition effect is less on the aged Rh/CeO2 than on its fresh state. The focus of this work is to explore the nature of this activity enhancement on the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst and the effect of water. Ceria and alumina supported Rh catalysts were characterized by in-situ DRIFTS with CO and N2O as probe molecules to investigate the synergism between Rh species and ceria support and the interaction between water molecules and the Rh/CeO2 catalysts. The results suggest that Rh supported on ceria has more CO adsorption sites and better hydrothermal stability than that on alumina. On Rh/CeO2 catalysts, the surface Rh species was found to facilitate the reduction of Ce4+ ions to Ce3+ at the interfacial area and as a result increased the concentration of Ce3+ species relative to the CeO2 support after a reduction treatment. Ce3+ ions at the interface between Rh and CeO2 support can be easily oxidized to Ce4+ by N2O at room temperature and played an important role in the disassociation of N2O. After a hydrothermal aging treatment on Rh/CeO2, more surface Rh sites were found that can adsorb CO and N2O. In addition, on the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst, a different type of Rh species was found to be situated in a more electron-rich environment. These combined factors may be responsible for its enhanced N2O decomposition activity on the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst. DRITFS were also collected on fresh and aged Rh/CeO2 catalysts with different degrees of sample hydration. The intensity of the OH group at 3658 cm−1 over an aged catalyst was found to decrease with increasing temperature at a faster rate than that on the fresh catalyst. This finding may explain their difference in H2O sensitivity for the N2O decomposition reaction. Keywords Supported Rh catalysts Nitrous oxide Decomposition DRIFTS Ceria 1 Introduction Nitrous oxide (N2O) has a strong global warming potential (298 times of carbon dioxide) with an atmospheric life of 114 years. N2O is also a contributor to the destruction of ozone in the stratosphere [1]. Automotive emission is one source of N2O generation, and the U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) has set up N2O emission limits for various types of on-road vehicles. N2O can be generated as a byproduct of exhaust gases treatment over different types of catalytic converters, such as diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), three-way catalysts (TWC), selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx using NH3 or hydrocarbons and NH3 oxidation catalyst (AMOx) [2,3]. In addition to minimizing its formation in catalyst design, catalytic decomposition of N2O after it is formed may offer an alternative approach to meet the regulations, provided such a catalyst exists. Many catalytic materials have been investigated for this reaction, such as metal ions exchanged zeolite [4–7], supported metal oxides [8–10], mixed oxides catalysts [11,12] and supported precious metal catalysts [13–15]. In addition to a sufficient reaction rate, a practical N2O catalyst for automotive applications must be able to function in the presence of both excess O2 and high concentrations of H2O and stable after high temperature aging under hydrothermal conditions. Most of the catalysts reported in literature were tested in the absence of H2O on fresh catalysts. Wang et al. compared the N2O decomposition activity over Fe/SSZ-13 and Fe-Beta zeolite under dry and wet condition and their results suggested that the performance under wet condition is significantly lower than that under dry condition and Fe/SSZ-13 shows better water resistance than Fe-Beta in this reaction [16]. Konsolakis et al. found that CuO-CeO2 mixed oxide catalysts could achieve a complete N2O conversion at 550 °C in the absence of O2, but the performance was slightly degraded in the presence of O2. They attributed the superior performance of CuO-CeO2 mixed oxides catalysts to their excellent redox properties [8]. Zabilskiy et al. examined the performance of nanosized CuO/CeO2 materials with different crystalline plane of ceria and the results suggested that CuO supported on ceria nanorod with the terminating planes of {100} and {110} is more active than that on ceria nanocube or polyhedral ceria due to lower activation energy for N2O decomposition [17,18]. Franken and Palkovits investigated the effect of potassium on CuxCo3-xO4 catalysts for N2O decomposition and found that doping a small amount of K significantly reduced the temperature for a complete conversion of N2O. However, with the presence of 2% O2 and 0.5% H2O in the feed, the full-conversion temperature increased from 330 °C to 570 °C [12]. Yu et al. found the addition of small amount of silver can improve the N2O decomposition performance of Co3O4 further by weakening the Co-O bond [19]. Presumably, the strong negative impact by H2O is due to the competition between H2O and N2O for adsorption sites [5,14,20]. Parres-Esclapez et al. studied the reaction mechanism for N2O decomposition over Rh/CeO2 and Rh/-Al2O3 catalysts using in-situ DRIFTS and Raman spectroscopy with isotopically labelled N2O and O2. They found that the higher catalytic performance of the Rh/CeO2 catalyst was related to the interaction between the Rh species and the ceria support and that the ceria support contributed to the reaction [13]. For automotive applications, lower reaction temperature with the presence of water and O2 is essential. Recently, Li et al. investigated the performance of ceria supported PGM (rhodium, platinum and palladium) for this reaction and found that Rh/CeO2 was a promising candidate for the removal of N2O in automotive exhausts [21]. N2O conversions were measured with a feed containing 5% H2O and O2 at a high space velocity (WHSV = 250,000 cm3/g/h) on hydrothermally aged catalysts (750 °C, 20 h with 10% H2O in air) [21]. Generally, the performance of the supported Rh and Rh exchanged zeolite catalysts decays significantly after aging treatment or in the presence of H2O. Rh/CeO2 is an exception; thermal aging treatment actually enhances its catalytic activity. Further, the H2O inhibition effect on the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst was found to be less than that of its fresh state. To understand the activity enhancement by aging over Rh/CeO2 and the nature of H2O sensitivity, the same catalysts, Rh/γ-Al2O3 and Rh/CeO2, evaluated in Li et al. [21] were characterized using in-situ DRIFTS. Surface Rh species and surface adsorbed N2O species over Rh/Al2O3 and Rh/CeO2 were probed to understand the role of ceria support and the reaction mechanism of the decomposition of N2O over Rh/CeO2. The difference in H2O sensitivity between a fresh and an aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst may be explained with the stability of OH groups on the catalyst. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The supported Rh catalysts (1% by weight) were prepared by impregnating Rh nitrate solution on a commercially available ceria support (BET with a surface area = 144 m2/g) and an alumina support (BET surface area = 137 m2/g) using the incipient wetness technique. The impregnated catalyst was dried at 110 °C for 2 h and then calcined at 500 °C for 2 h in an oven, and the so obtained catalyst is designated as a fresh catalyst. A portion of the fresh catalyst was aged at 750 °C for 20 h with 10% H2O in air. The corresponding BET surface areas of the ceria and alumina supports after aging were determined to be 77 and 136 m2/g, respectively. 2.2 Characterizations CO/N2O DRIFT spectroscopy was performed using CO/N2O as a probe molecule for both the Rh sites and the supports. The measurements were made on a Bio-Rad Excalibur FTS 3000 IR spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector and a PikeTech high-temperature environmental chamber with ZnSe windows. A sample was ground into a fine powder with a mortar and pestle and then packed into a sample cup. The sample powder was first dehydrated at 400 °C for 1 h in flowing Ar at the flow rate of 40 ml/min and then cooled down to 30 °C A spectrum was taken for the sample without the adsorption of probe molecule as a background. Then, 1% of CO/N2O in Ar was introduced into the chamber, and a series of spectra was taken as a function of CO/N2O exposure time. The system was subsequently equilibrated at 30 °C in flowing Ar. Difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the spectra with the probe molecule from the background spectrum (without probe molecule). An IR spectrum was collected with 64 scans and a resolution of 4 cm−1. For reduction treatment, sample powders were reduced at 400 °C for 1 h in flowing 3% of H2 in Ar at 40 ml/min and then cooled down to 30 °C. Temperature programmed DRIFT spectroscopy was performed on a Bio-Rad Excalibur FTS 3000 IR spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector and a PikeTech high-temperature environmental chamber with ZnSe windows. A sample was ground into a fine powder with a mortar and pestle and then packed into a sample cup. The sample powder was first purged at 40 °C for 1 h in flowing Ar at 40 ml/min and, then the sample was heated to 400 °C in flowing Ar at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min. An IR spectrum was collected every 20 °C during the temperature ramp, and a KBr spectrum collected at 40 °C was used as the background. 2.3 Catalyst testing All catalysts were tested with a high-throughput reactor. A sample mass of 0.2 g was used with a total feed flow rate of 50 L/h, corresponding to a WHSV of 250,000 cm3/g/h or a monolith equivalent GHSV of 30,000 h−1 assuming 2 g/in3 washcoat loading. The catalysts were tested under steady-state conditions at 400 °C. The reaction feed consisted of 200 ppm N2O, 5% CO2, 5% O2 (when added), 5% H2O (when added) and balance N2. Catalysts were tested in both fresh (500 °C/2 h calcined) and aged (750 °C/20 h) states. The reaction effluent was analyzed by an IR spectrometer (Advance Optima AO2000 series) with a N2O dosing and detection variability within +/-1%. No background N2O was detected with an empty reactor. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 N2O decomposition performance of Rh/γ-Al2O3 and Rh/CeO2 catalysts Fig. 1 presented N2O conversion with and without water of fresh and aged Rh/γ-Al2O3 and Rh/CeO2 catalysts at 400 °C. The catalytic performance of these catalysts was tested by using a gas composition of 200 ppm of N2O, 5% of O2 with or without 5% of H2O and balanced by N2. These data were reported previously [21]. For Rh/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, fresh sample presented high N2O conversion of 98% at 400 °C without H2O and N2O conversion dropped to 17% with H2O. After aging, the N2O conversion of Rh/γ-Al2O3 catalyst decreased dramatically to 3% without H2O and 1% with H2O. Obviously, both water addition and aging treatment have strong negative impact on N2O decomposition performance of Rh/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. For Rh/CeO2 catalysts, fresh sample presented a N2O conversion of 75% without H2O and 8% with H2O. The addition of water to gas feed has a strong negative impact on N2O decomposition performance, which is similar with Rh/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. However, after aging treatment, N2O conversion increased from 75% to 92% without H2O and from 8% to 32% with H2O, respectively. It is clearly suggested that the catalytic performance and water resistance of Rh/CeO2 were enhanced surprisingly by aging treatment, which is different from Rh/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Accordingly, the focus of this work is to understand both performance and water resistance enhancement by aging treatment on Rh/CeO2 catalyst. 3.2 CO-DRIFTS results CO-DRIFTS were carried out to investigate the adsorption sites on rhodium species over Rh/Al2O3 and Rh/CeO2 catalysts. Figs. 2 A and 2B show the CO-DRIFTS spectra on fresh and aged Rh/γ-Al2O3 and Rh/CeO2 catalysts after dehydration and reduction at 400 °C. All spectra were collected after 30 min of CO exposure. For fresh Rh/γ-Al2O3, after the dehydration treatment two major peaks were observed at 2095 and 2018 cm−1 with a shoulder at 2117 cm−1. The peaks at 2095 and 2018 cm−1 can be assigned to the absorption of CO dimer on Rh+ and the shoulder at 2117 cm−1 to the absorption of CO on Rh2+ species. After reduction, the peak intensity on the fresh Rh/Al2O3 catalyst increased, and a new peak at 2057 cm−1 appeared, which is assigned to the absorption of CO on metallic Rh species [22–25]. Simultaneously, the peak at 2117 cm−1 disappeared. This result suggests that part of charged Rh species was reduced to metallic under current reduction condition. After aging treatment, similar spectra were observed as the fresh sample but with a much lower peak intensity, which indicates that there are much fewer Rh adsorption sites on the aged sample, possibly due to the formation of rhodium aluminate spinel and or metal sintering. On the fresh Rh/CeO2 catalyst, the twin bands for CO dimer adsorbed on Rh+ were observed at 2085 and 2018 cm−1 after dehydration, where the upper band (2085 cm−1) is about 10 cm−1 lower than that on Rh/γ-Al2O3. After reduction at 400 °C, both Rh+ and metallic Rh species were found, as evidenced by the bands at 2085 and 2018 cm-1 (CO dimers on Rh+) and at 2057 cm−1 (metallic Rh species). Note, the intensity ratio of metallic Rh species to Rh+ species is much higher on Rh/CeO2 than that on Rh/γ-Al2O3. Compared to Rh/γ-Al2O3, the down shift of the Rh+ species (in a more electron-rich environment) and a higher Rh°/Rh+ ratio after reduction suggests that Rh species on ceria is easier to reduce. In contrast to Rh/γ-Al2O, aging treatment appears to slightly increase the overall CO peak intensity on Rh/CeO2, which is much higher than that on the aged Rh/γ-Al2O3, either dehydrated or reduced. This indicates that there are more surface Rh sites available on ceria that are active for CO adsorption, especially after aging. Given the fact that aging reduces the BET surface area of the CeO2 support by one half (144 to 77 m2/g), it is interesting to find more surface Rh species after aging. In addition, a new type of Rh+ species appeared on the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst with CO adsorption bands at 2075 and 2008 cm−1. Comparing with the Rh+ species observed on the fresh sample, the CO adsorbed on the new Rh+ species have lower adsorption wavenumbers, suggesting a more electron-rich environment for the new Rh+ species. Perhaps, on the aged Rh/ceria catalyst, new Rh+ species is situated in an environment with an increased Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio or oxygen vacancy. In the other words, the formation of Ce3+ or oxygen vacancies is much easier around new Rh+ species, which could be responsible for improve N2O decomposition performance after aging treatment. After reduction, one negative band was found at ∼2115 cm-1 on both fresh and aged Rh/CeO2 catalysts. This band is assigned to the absorption of f electron transition in Ce3+ ion, which can be used as an indication of the relative abundance of Ce3+ ions or oxygen vacancies [26,27]. The negative peak is due to the decrease of Ce3+ concentration or the change of Ce3+ to Ce4+ during CO adsorption relative to the background. As reported elsewhere [28–31], Ce3+ ions can be oxidized to Ce4+ by CO molecule due to strong reduction ability of Ce3+ or oxygen vacancy associated with Ce3+ ions on surface, resulting in the formation of surface carbon species and carbonate species. To investigate the interactions between CO and the Rh species and between CO and the support, CO DRIFTS were collected as a function of CO exposure time on the samples (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3A shows the CO-DRIFTS spectra collected on the reduced fresh Rh/γ-Al2O3 catalyst at CO exposure time of 0.5–30 min. Rh+ and metallic Rh species were observed immediately upon CO exposure, and the peak intensity of the Rh+ species only slightly increased during the entire period of CO exposure. Similar results were observed on the reduced aged Rh/γ-Al2O3 sample (not shown here). For reduced fresh Rh/CeO2 sample, as shown in Fig. 3B, the spectra shifted dramatically to higher wavenumbers as CO exposure time increased from 0.5 to 30 min. At 0.5 min, all CO adsorption bands were found at much lower wavenumbers. With increasing the CO exposure time, the CO bands shifted to higher wavenumbers, indicating that the Rh species became less electron rich. The peak intensity at ∼2115 cm−1 for Ce3+ decreased with CO exposure time, which is due to the transition from Ce3+ to Ce4+. As reported elsewhere, CO disproportionation or disassociation reaction occurs on a reduced CeO2 support, resulting in formation of C and CO2 with a simultaneous decrease in Ce3+ sites [28–31]. Therefore, the peak intensity decreases at 2115 cm−1 is the result of the reaction between reduced Ce3+ and CO, forming Ce4+ as a product. The transition from Ce3+ to Ce4+ on the ceria around Rh changes the environment of the Rh species from electron rich to electron lean, resulting in a dramatic shift of the band position upward with CO exposure time. Due to the continuous change of Ce3+ to Ce4+ with CO exposure time, it is difficult to make a clear assignment of each CO band during CO exposure. However, the results clearly suggest that the band positions of CO adsorbed on the surface Rh species shift due to oxidation of Ce3+ to Ce4+ and that these Ce3+ ions are very close to Rh species. As shown in Fig. 3C, similar behavior was observed on reduced aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst. These results suggested that Ce3+ at the interface between Rh species and ceria can be easily oxidized to Ce4+ by CO molecule even at room temperature. Based on the CO-DRIFTS results, we can conclude that (1) there are more surface Rh sites available for CO adsorption on the ceria support and those on alumina at the same Rh loading; (2) hydrothermal aging slightly increases the number of surface Rh species on ceria but significantly reduces that on alumina; (3) Rh species is easier to reduce on ceria than on alumina; and (4) Ce3+ at the interfacial area between Rh and ceria can be easily oxidized to Ce4+ by CO even at room temperature. 3.3 N2O-DRIFTS results Fig. 4 shows the N2O-DRIFTS results of fresh and aged Rh/γ-Al2O3 catalysts after dehydration at 400 °C. Two types of adsorbed N2O species were observed on these two samples. On the fresh sample, the bands at 2224 and 2308 cm−1 can be assigned to the absorption of N2O on the support and the Rh species, respectively [13,32]. However, after aging treatment, the peak intensity at 2308 cm−1 decreased dramatically (by an order of magnitude), which could be a result of decreased surface Rh sites capable to CO adsorption. Simultaneously, the band position for N2O adsorbed on the alumina support shifted from 2224 to 2239 cm−1, and the peak became broader. On Rh/γ-Al2O3, Rh is the catalytically active component for N2O decomposition [13]. Thus, the significant decrease of surface Rh sites by aging is consistent with the aging effect on the N2O decomposition activity on the Rh/γ-Al2O3 catalyst [21]. Fig. 5 shows the N2O-DRIFTS spectra collected on fresh CeO2 support, fresh and aged Rh/CeO2 catalysts after dehydration. A strong adsorption band was found on the ceria support at 2238 cm−1 with two shoulders at 2257 and 2226 cm−1. These bands can be assigned to the N2O adsorbed on the ceria sites of slightly different environments. On fresh Rh/CeO2, a new band appeared at 2304 cm−1 with a very low intensity, which can be assigned to N2O adsorbed on the Rh species. The band intensity at 2238 cm−1 (N2O on ceria support) decreased to about 1/5 relative to the that on pure ceria support. These results clearly show that although N2O can adsorb on both the Rh species and the ceria support, the majority of N2O is adsorbed on the ceria support. Because ceria alone has an extremely low N2O decomposition activity, the strong adsorption of N2O on the ceria support may not be a direct contributor to the catalytic performance. On the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst, the band for N2O adsorbed on Rh species appeared at 2300 cm−1 with a significantly increased intensity comparing with the fresh catalyst, whereas the band for N2O adsorbed on ceria support remained at the same position (2237 cm−1) with a lightly reduced intensity relative to the fresh catalyst. The concentration for Ce3+ or oxygen vacancies was investigated during N2O adsorption at room temperature by monitoring the band at 2115 cm−1 (f electron transition in Ce3+ ions) as a function of time. A negative peak indicates that the Ce3+ ions are oxidized to Ce4+ ions. Fig. 6 shows the DRIFTS results of reduced CeO2 support, fresh and aged Rh/CeO2 catalysts during the N2O adsorption. Over all samples, the peak at 2115 cm−1 decreased with N2O exposure time. The intensity of this negative peak at 2115 cm−1 is much higher on the fresh Rh/CeO2 catalyst than on the aged catalyst and the ceria support. This suggests that more Ce3+ was formed on the fresh Rh/CeO2 catalyst than on the ceria support. Because the BET surface areas of the CeO2 support and the fresh Rh/CeO2 catalyst are similar, it follows that the Rh species on CeO2 promotes the formation of Ce3+ ions and increases the Ce3+ concentration on ceria support. On Rh/CeO2, Ce3+ species can easily be oxidized by N2O even at room temperature. However, the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ cannot occur at room temperature by releasing O2, and thus the release of O2 is believed to be the rate limiting step. On the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst, the intensity of the negative peak at 2115 cm−1 is about one half of the fresh Rh/CeO2 catalyst but still several times higher than the CeO2 support. Based on N2O-DRIFTS results, it can be concluded that the decomposition of N2O on Rh/CeO2 can occur on both Rh species and ceria support and Ce3+ can be oxidized to Ce4+ by N2O even at room temperature. The Rh species enhances the reduction of ceria significantly comparing with the pure CeO2 support. However, the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ cannot happen at room temperature, and O2 release from Rh/CeO2 may be the rate limiting step for N2O decomposition. This is in consistence with the conclusion reported by S. Parres-Esclapez et al [13]. 3.4 Surface OH groups as a function of temperature To understand the difference in water sensitivity between the fresh and aged Rh/CeO2 catalysts for N2O decomposition, we performed temperature programmed DRIFTS experiment over samples saturated with H2O. The CeO2 support, fresh and aged Rh/CeO2 catalysts were investigated in flowing Ar after being saturated with H2O, and the results are shown in Figs. 7 A, B and C. For the CeO2 support, the absorption bands for different OH groups were observed at 3698, 3687 and 3658 cm−1, and a broad band from 3550 to 3300 cm−1, a hydrogen-bond OH group, was also observed. The peak at 3658 cm−1 can be assigned to surface OH group on bridging Ce-O-Ce sites, and the peak at 3687 cm−1 can be assigned to undissociated water molecules [26,33]. When the temperature increased to ∼200 °C, the broad band (OH group with hydrogen bond) decreased significantly due to the removal of adsorbed water molecule. A new band at 3495 cm−1 appeared at high temperature, which can be assigned to the OH group associated with CeOOH. This implies that some Ce4+ is reduced to Ce3+ at high temperature in flowing Ar. As shown in Fig. 7B, over fresh Rh/CeO2, similar surface OH groups were observed as CeO2 but with a lower intensity. Note, initially the broad band between 3550 and 3300 cm−1 (OH group with hydrogen-bond) is strong, which disappeared at ∼160 °C. Comparing with the ceria support, the presence of Rh species reduces the concentration of surface OH groups on the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 7C, the peak intensities of the surface OH groups decreased further on the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst. (Note, Fig. 7C has a smaller scale on the y-axis scale than Figs. 7A and 7B). On the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst, the peak intensity of the OH group with hydrogen-bond (3550 to 3300 cm−1) is much weaker than that of the bridging OH group, Ce-OH-Ce, (3658 cm−1) at elevated temperatures, which is quite different from the ceria support and the fresh Rh/CeO2 catalyst. This clearly suggests that aging treatment on Rh/CeO2 significantly reduces the amount of surface OH groups that can form hydrogen bond, resulting in less water adsorption on the catalyst and perhaps contributing to improved hydrophobicity. Fig. 8 shows the peak intensity ratio of the OH group at 3658 cm−1 collected at different temperatures to that collected at 40 °C as a function of temperature over the CeO2 support, fresh and aged Rh/CeO2 catalysts. It is obvious that surface OH group on the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst decreases faster with increasing temperature than the fresh Rh/CeO2 catalyst and the CeO2 support. At 400 °C, the intensity ratio is about 0.3 on the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst, about 0.5 and 0.9 on the fresh Rh/CeO2 catalyst and the CeO2 support, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, at 400 °C the N2O conversion with 5% H2O in feed is 32% on aged Rh/CeO2 and 8% on the fresh catalysts. Part of the activity enhancement is due to the activation effect by thermal aging (75–92% in the absence of H2O), and the improved H2O sensitivity on the aged catalyst also contributes to the higher activity with the H2O-containing feed. Separate experiments performed by Li et al. showed that with increasing H2O concentration in the feed the rate of N2O conversion decrease at 400 °C is slower on the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst than on the fresh catalyst [21]. The DRIFTS data suggest that the decreased hydroxyl species on the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst may be responsible for its improved H2O sensitivity. This conclusion is also supported by the UV–vis-NIR spectra (Fig. S1) collected on fresh and 700 °C calcined CeO2 support, which shows lower intensity of hydroxyl group on the calcined CeO2. Thus, it is reasonable to believe that the lower H2O sensitivity of the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst may be due to the change of ceria support caused by thermal treatment. Rh supported on a pre-calcined (700 °C) CeO2 support also showed a higher N2O conversion in the presence of excess O2 and H2O compared with Rh on a CeO2 support without pre-calcination. 4 Conclusion CO-DRIFTS experiments performed on the fresh and aged Rh/Al2O3 and Rh/CeO2 catalysts show that more surface Rh sites were found on the Rh/CeO2 catalyst, that can adsorb CO, compared with the Rh/Al2O3 catalyst. The amount of surface Rh species on the Al2O3 support was significantly reduced by hydrothermal aging, whereas that on CeO2 was slightly increased. On Rh/CeO2, Rh promotes the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ and increases the Ce3+ concentration relative to the CeO2 support. Ce3+ or oxygen vacancies plays an important role in the disassociation of N2O, and the Ce3+ species at the interfacial area between Rh and CeO2 can be oxidized easily to Ce4+ by CO or N2O even at room temperature. The rate determining step for N2O decomposition is believed to be the release of O2 from the catalyst surface, which requires a higher temperature. N2O-DRIFTS results show that, after dehydration, much more N2O adsorbed on the Rh species was found on the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst than on the fresh catalyst. On the other hand, the OH-DRIFTS experiments detected a decreased amount of hydroxyl groups on the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst. In summary, the improved N2O performance of the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst in the presence of water and the excess of O2 is due to both more surface active Rh species and to fewer hydroxyl groups on the surface.

        "dc:description": "Ceria supported Rh catalysts exhibit superior activities for the decomposition of N2O in the presence of water and excess O2 comparing with other oxides supported Rh catalysts. In contrast to Rh/γ-Al2O, hydrothermal aging (750 °C for 20 h with 10% H2O in air) significantly enhances the catalytic activity of Rh/CeO2 for the decomposition of N2O. The presence of H2O, on the other hand, inhibits the reaction rate on all Rh catalysts, but this inhibition effect is less on the aged Rh/CeO2 than on its fresh state. The focus of this work is to explore the nature of this activity enhancement on the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst and the effect of water. Ceria and alumina supported Rh catalysts were characterized by in-situ DRIFTS with CO and N2O as probe molecules to investigate the synergism between Rh species and ceria support and the interaction between water molecules and the Rh/CeO2 catalysts. The results suggest that Rh supported on ceria has more CO adsorption sites and better hydrothermal stability than that on alumina. On Rh/CeO2 catalysts, the surface Rh species was found to facilitate the reduction of Ce4+ ions to Ce3+ at the interfacial area and as a result increased the concentration of Ce3+ species relative to the CeO2 support after a reduction treatment. Ce3+ ions at the interface between Rh and CeO2 support can be easily oxidized to Ce4+ by N2O at room temperature and played an important role in the disassociation of N2O. After a hydrothermal aging treatment on Rh/CeO2, more surface Rh sites were found that can adsorb CO and N2O. In addition, on the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst, a different type of Rh species was found to be situated in a more electron-rich environment. These combined factors may be responsible for its enhanced N2O decomposition activity on the aged Rh/CeO2 catalyst. DRITFS were also collected on fresh and aged Rh/CeO2 catalysts with different degrees of sample hydration. The intensity of the OH group at 3658 cm−1 over an aged catalyst was found to decrease with increasing temperature at a faster rate than that on the fresh catalyst. This finding may explain their difference in H2O sensitivity for the N2O decomposition reaction.",
