Graphical abstract Since the nanoscale metals anchored on the perovskite surface possess catalytic activity for SRR and SOR reactions, the STO@Fe electrode can maintain an initial specific capacity of 672 mA h g−1 at 3C. To obtain high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, it is necessary to rationally design electrocatalytic materials that can promote efficient sulfur electrochemical reactions. Herein, the robust heterostructured material of nanoscale transition metal anchored on perovskite oxide was designed for efficient catalytic kinetics of the oxidation and reduction reactions of lithium polysulphide (LiPSs), and verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental characterizations. Due to the strong interaction of nanoscale transition metals with LiPSs through chemical coupling, heterostructured materials (STO@M) (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) exhibit excellent catalytic activity for redox reactions of LiPSs. The bifunctional heterostructure material STO@Fe exhibits good rate performance and cycling stability as the cathode host, realizing a high-performance Li-S battery that can maintain stable cycling under rapid charge–discharge cycling. This study presents a novel approach to designing electrocatalytic materials for redox reactions of LiPSs, which promotes the development of fast charge–discharge Li-S batteries. Keywords Nanoscale transition metal Lithium polysulfide Catalytic activity Redox reaction Lithium-sulfur battery 1 Introduction Due to its potential advantages of high specific energy (2600 Wh kg−1) and low cost, Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been regarded as one of the most promising new-generation rechargeable batteries [1-3]. However, Li-S batteries still face some problems, such as the low conductivity of sulfur, the shuttle effect of intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in the electrolyte, and the huge volume change during cycling in practical applications [4,5]. The above problems will lead to low utilization of sulfur and rapid capacity decay during cycling, which severely limits the practical application of Li-S batteries. Therefore, solving the shuttle effect of LiPSs and improving the utilization of sulfur is one of the key challenges in developing Li-S batteries [6-8]. In the current research work, researchers have extensively studied methods that can effectively inhibit the shuttle effect of LiPSs, namely anchoring LiPSs through physical confinement [9,10] and chemisorption or interaction [11,12]. Such as transition metal oxides [13-17],transition metal sulfides [18-21], transition metal nitrides [22], and transition metal phosphides [23-29], etc. Which has good adsorptive and catalytic performance for LiPSs. The charging and discharging processes of Li-S batteries involve complex phase transitions and multiple electron transfer reactions [30-32].Among them, the slow kinetics of the conversion of LiPSs into lithium sulfide and sulfur species during charge and discharge is the main reason for the low utilization of sulfur [33]. In most cases, the discharge product lithium sulfide was difficult to oxidize on the surface of the polar host directly [34,35]. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce additional catalytic materials to promote the oxidation reaction of LiPSs in this process to improve the electrode reaction rate and realize the rapid charge–discharge cycling of Li-S batteries [14,36-49]. Given the above problems, introducing metal catalysts with conductive and catalytic functions is very effective. In previous studies, Pt [50], Pd [51], and single-atom transition metals [52-55] are commonly used catalysts in Li-S batteries. The nanoscale transition metals not only have abundant active sites and high specific surface area but also have the advantages of a simple preparation process and have broad application prospects in Li-S batteries [56,57].But how to keep the structure of nanoscale transition metals stable and non-agglomerated during the reaction is still a challenge. Herein, we combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental characterizations to propose the mechanism for nanoscale transition metals catalyzed redox reactions of LiPSs. Robust heterostructured materials have been designed with nanoscale transition metals Fe, Ni, and Cu anchored on the surface of perovskite oxides by in situ exsolution to form heterostructured materials STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu). On the surface of heterostructured materials STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu), the in situ exsolved nanoscale transition metal atoms can produce strong interactions with LiPSs through chemical coupling. Therefore, heterostructure materials STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) exhibit good LiPSs adsorptive performance, as well as excellent catalytic activity for LiPSs reduction reactions (SRR) and LiPSsoxidation reactions (SOR). The bifunctional heterostructure material STO@Fe as the cathode host in Li-S batteries can meet the rapid charge and discharge cycling needs of Li-S batteries and maintain good cycle stability even at higher rates. The STO@Fe electrode has a high initial specific capacity of 672 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 3C, and can still maintain a high specific capacity of 353 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles. This research contributes to realizing the stable cycling of Li-S batteries in the fast charge–discharge state. 2 Experimental 2.1 Sample preparation The strontium titanate perovskite Sr0.9Ti0.9M0.1O3- δ (STM0.1) (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) was prepared by the sol–gel combustion method. Sr(NO3)2, FeN3O9·9H2O, NiN2O6·6H2O, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, tetrabutyl titanate, and citric acid were used as raw materials. And N, N-2-dimethylformamide (DMF) was used as a solvent. The precursor powder was calcined at 950 °C for 5 h and then ball-milled in a ball mill for 36 h (the ball to the material was 3:1). To exsolve the atoms in the crystal lattice, the reduction was performed in an atmosphere furnace. A continuous gas flow of 10% H2/Ar was passed at 700 °C for 5 h. Then heterostructure materials STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) were prepared. In the compound of STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu), the content of Sr element is 18.4%, the content of Ti element is 18.4%, the content of transition metal M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) element is 2.0%, and the content of O element is 61.2%. 2.2 Materials characterization We characterized the crystal structure of the samples using a Rigaku Ulti mA IV X-ray diffractometer (scanning range of 20-80° and scan speed of 10° min−1). The microscopic morphology of the samples was characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Quanta FEG 250), and the components and contents of the materials were analyzed by an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The prepared materials were qualitatively and semi-quantitatively characterized by a 5400 ESCA X-ray photoelectron spectrometer from Perkin Elmer, USA. The surface element composition, proportion, valence state, and binding mode of surface elements were analyzed. 2.3 Adsorption of polysulfides S and Li2S were dissolved in DME ether in a stoichiometric ratio to obtain a Li2S6 solution with a 2.5 mmol L-1. Add 0.1 mol STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) to 2.0 mL Li2S6 solution. Shake vigorously for 1 min, let stand for 6 h, and take digital photos. The adsorbed supernatant was diluted for UV spectroscopic analysis, and the lower layer material was dried in a glove box for XPS analysis. 2.4 Assembly of Li2S6 symmetric cells Carbon papers (CPs) were cut into 12.0 mm diameter disks by a punch. 0.5 mg cm-2STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) powders were then loaded onto the CP scaffolds and denoted as STO@M@CP (M = Fe, Ni, Cu). The typical STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) loading onto CPs involved a sequence of dispersing STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) in ethanol, dropwise adding the dispersion onto CP disks, and drying the STO@M@CP (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) at 60 °C for 12.0 h.And 40.0 μL Li2S6 (0.5 mol L-1 [S]) DOL/DME (v/v = 1/1) electrolyte was added. Contains 1 mol L-1 LiTFSI. The CV test range of the symmetrical cell was −0.8 V-0.8 V, and the sweep rate was 1000 mV s−1. 2.5 Nucleation and decomposition of Li2S The nominal stoichiometric Li2S8 solution (2.0 mol L-1 [S]). The STO@M was dispersed on a carbon paper disk with a diameter of 12.0 mm to obtain a pole piece. The pole piece loading was 0.5 mg cm−2. A lithium sheet was used as the anode. 40 μL Li2S8 solution and 40 μL blank electrolyte were added to the cathode and anode, respectively. The cells were first galvanostatic discharged to 2.06 V at 0.112 mA and then kept potentiostatic discharge at 2.05 V. When the current was lower than 10-5A, the potentiostatic discharge was stopped. The decomposition experiment of Li2S was to assemble the battery similarly, discharge it to 1.6 V at 0.112 mA, and then charge it to 2.09 V with a constant current of 0.112 mA. The battery was then charged under constant voltage at 2.10 V to a current below 10-5 A for Li2S decomposition. 2.6 Electrode preparation The preparation process of the electrode was as follows: sulfur, CNT, and STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) were mixed in proportion (mass ratio 7:2:1), and the obtained composite positive electrode material was mixed with Super P and PVDF (mass ratio 7:2:1), with NMP as solvent. Coated on carbon paper, vacuum dried at 60 °C for 12 h. In this experiment, electrodes were cut into 12 mm diameter discs, and thethickness of the cathode was about 0.7 mm. The exact S content of each final electrode disc is 49%, which is the S content of the entire electrode, excluding carbon paper. And for the uniformity of the experiment, the S content of all the battery electrodes is the same. 2.7 Electrochemical evaluation A lithium-sulfur battery was assembled with a metal lithium sheet as the negative electrode (14 mm in diameter and 1.1 mm in thickness) and a sulfur-containing electrode sheet as the positive electrode. Celgard 2500 was used as a separator, and nickel foam was used as tight-fitting support for the battery. The battery was assembled with CR-2025 positive and negative electrode shells. The oxygen content of the water in the glove box was less than 0.5 ppm. The electrolyte contained 1 mol L-1 lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonimide (LiTFSI) mixed solution of DOL and DME (volume ratio 1:1) and was added with a 2% LiNO3 additive. The electrolyte/sulfur ratio was 20 μLE mg-1 S throughout the experiment. Constant charge–discharge cycles of the batteries were performed in the voltage range of 1.6–2.8 V. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) test range was 10-1 to 10-5 Hz. 2.8 Computational details The spin-polarized calculations were performed using the projector-enhanced plane-wave method within the framework of density functional theory. The cutoff energy of the plane wave was set to 450 eV. In the iterative solution of the Kohn-Sham equation, the energy criterion was set to 10-5 eV. The unit cell of Cs3Cu2Cl5 relaxes until the residual force on the atoms drops to less than 0.02 eV/Å. The Brillouin zone integration was performed using 9 × 9 × 9 Monkhorst-Pack grids and onlyGa mA point for optimization of Fe, Ni, and Cu unit cells and their slabs, respectively. The slabs were derived from the cleavage of metal bulks along the (111) direction. A vacuum layer of 15 Å was added perpendicular to the sheet to avoid artificial interaction between periodic images. Large surface areas (>10 Å×10 Å) were adopted to decrease the interaction effect between adsorbents. 3 Results and discussion In electrocatalytic materials, the (111) crystal plane of transition metals is the main crystal plane that produces catalytic activity. Therefore, in this manuscript, the transformation reaction of Li2S4 and Li2S on the (111) crystal plane of transition metals Fe, Ni, and Cu was investigated by DFT calculations. The structural models of the (111) planes of transition metals Fe, Ni, and Cu are shown in Fig. S1. Fig. 1 (a) shows the adsorption models of Li2S4 on the (111) crystal plane of transition metals Fe, Ni, and Cu, while Fig. 1(b-d) shows the adsorption models of Li2S2, Li2S, and LiS, respectively. The adsorption energies of Li2S4 on the (111) crystal plane of transition metals Fe, Ni, and Cu were 1.77, 0.81, and 0.56 eV, respectively. DFT calculation results show that transition metal Fe has the strongest adsorption capacity for Li2S4. The calculated partial densities of states (PDOS) of transition metals Fe, Ni, and Cu are shown in Fig. 1(e), and the d-band center of Fe is −0.332 eV, which is closest to the Fermi level. The d-band centers of Ni (-1.482 eV) and Cu (-2.106 eV) are relatively far from the Fermi level. Therefore, the electron transfer rate on the transition metal Fe surface is faster, and the LiPSs are more easily react. The free energy changes of the transformation reaction of Li2S4 and Li2S on the (111) plane of transition metals Fe, Ni, and Cu were analyzed by DFT calculations. The reaction energy barrier of the (111) plane of transition metal Fe is −1.76 eV in the reaction corresponding to the conversion of Li2S4-Li2S2 (Fig. 1f), which is lower than that of the transition metals Ni (-0.81 eV) and Cu (-0.56 eV). In the reaction corresponding to the decomposition of Li2S to LiS, the (111) plane of transition metal Fe has the lowest reaction energy barrier (0.21 eV). The reaction energy barriers lower than those of transition metals Ni and Cu are relatively high, 1.32 eV and 1.43 eV, respectively (Fig. 1g). The large difference in reaction energy barriers shows that the (111) crystal face of transition metal Fe has excellent catalytic performance for both SRR and SOR reactions of LiPSs. In particular, the catalytic effect is more pronounced for the decomposition of Li2S into LiS during the charging process. This is because the d orbital of transition metals has lone pair electrons, so it is easier to chemically interact with LiPSs, effectively reducing the reaction energy barrier. Among the transition metals Fe, Ni, and Cu, the transition metal Fe has the largest number of lone pair electrons. The interaction between Fe and LiPSs is the strongest, and the reaction energy barrier is the lowest. Therefore, the (111) plane of transition metal Fe can be used as a superior electrocatalytic material in Li-S batteries. Based on DFT calculations, we anchored the nanoscale transition metals Fe, Ni, and Cu on the surface of perovskite and constructed perovskite@nanometal heterostructure STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) through an in-situ exsolution strategy. Among them, the XRD patterns of Sr0.9TiO3- δ (STO3) and Sr0.9Ti0.9M0.1O3- δ (STM0.1) (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) before in-situ exsolution show that the metals Fe, Ni, and Cu are all fully incorporated into the strontium titanate perovskite lattice under oxidizing conditions, forming a stable perovskite structure (Fig. S2). Fig. 2 (a) shows the peaks of metals Fe, Ni, and Cu that in situ exsolved after reduction. The peaks around 45ocorrespond to metallic Fe, the peaks around 44° and 52° correspond to metallic Ni, and the peaks around 43° and 51° correspond to metallic Cu. XRD results prove the successful exsolution of metals Fe, Ni, and Cu. The microstructure of the perovskite STM0.1 (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) before exsolution was characterized by an SEM image, and the SEM image before ball milling showed that the perovskite STFe0.1 to STCu0.1 The particles are gradually regular and ordered (Fig. S3). Since the size of the nanoscale transition metal obtained by the in-situ exsolution method is too small, the particle morphology cannot be seen by SEM. Therefore, HRTEM was selected to study further the micro-morphology of the in-situ exsolved metals Fe, Ni, and Cu. The BET results showed that thespecific surface area of STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) catalysts were 23.1, 20.7, and 19.1 m2 g−1, respectively. HRTEM images of bifunctional heterostructure materials STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) are shown in Fig. 2(b-d). Among them, the interplanar spacing of Fe is 0.201 nm, which corresponds to the (111) plane of metallic Fe. The crystal planes with interplanar spacings of 0.198 nm and 0.203 nm correspond to the (111) plane of metallic Ni and the (111) plane of metallic Cu, respectively. HRTEM results show that the perovskite still maintains a high degree of crystallinity after the exsolution of nanoscale transition metal, which lays the foundation for its subsequent stable and good adsorptive and catalytic performance. The elemental composition of the bifunctional heterostructure material STO@Fe was investigated by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping. The element surface distribution map results show that the Sr, Ti, and O elements are uniformly distributed. The enrichment of in-situ exsolved Fe elements is shown in the lower left corner (Fig. 2e-i). Fig. 2(j) shows the EDS element line distribution diagram of the bifunctional heterostructure material STO@Fe. The line scan results of the elements also show the enrichment of individual Fe elements. The results of this part of the study are consistent with the TEM results, so it can be determined that the in-situ exsolved nanoparticles are Fe, and the exsolved nanoscale transition metal Fe and the strontium titanate perovskite matrix form a micro-nano heterostructure. To keep the structure of nanoscale transition metals stable in nanoscale heterostructured materials, we choose to anchor nanoscale transition metals on the surface of perovskite through the way of in situ exsolution. The in situ exsolved metals are socketed into the parent oxides. Such a configuration endows the strong metal-oxide interface action, leading to enhanced stability and exceptional capabilities for restricting metal nanoparticle agglomeration [58-60]. In previous studies, we have confirmed that heterostructure materials STO@Co compared with the STO/Co obtained by impregnation, the in situ exsolved Co is easier to keep stability in the reaction process and has better electrochemical performance [61]. Therefore, the strategy of in-situ exsolution is a good way to solve the instability of nanoscale transition metal structure in the reaction process. Chemisorption on LiPSs plays an essential role in inhibiting LiPSs shuttling. In this work, the perovskites STO@Fe, STO@Ni, and STO@Cu were dispersed in a Li2S6 solution to study their adsorptive properties to LiPSs (Fig. 3 a). The solution containing STO@Fe showed a nearly transparent color after adsorbing Li2S6. However, the control group containing perovskite STO@Ni and STO@Cu still retained a small amount of Li2S6 color. UV–Vis spectra showed that the peak of S6 2- almost disappeared in the solution after adsorbing Li2S6 by STO@Fe, so the bifunctional heterostructure material STO@Fe had a more adsorptive performance for LiPSs. The elemental composition of bifunctional heterostructure materials STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and its element ratio was analyzed. Fig. 3(b) shows that the peak at 138.3 eV corresponds to SrO1- δ , and the peak at 140.3 eV corresponds to Sr2+ [62,63]. The chemical properties of elements in STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) after adsorbing Li2S6 were deeply investigated by XPS. After absorbing Li2S6, the newly formed peak at 139.1 eV can be ascribed to the formation of the Sr-S bond (Fig. 3c). The XPS results of O 1s show that the peaks at 534.8, 536.3, and 537.4 eV of STO@M correspond to lattice oxygen (O2–), adsorbed oxygen (O2– and O-), and hydroxyl (OH–), respectively (Fig. 3d). While in the XPS result of O 1s, the peak appeared at 537.8 eV after adsorbing Li2S6, representing Li-O bonds (Fig. 3e) [64]. The XPS spectrum of Fe 3d shows that the Fe-S bond peak appears around 727.3 eV after adsorbing Li2S6 (Fig. 3f) [65], confirming the chemical coupling of Fe atoms with LiPSs. Similarly, in the XPS spectra of Ni 3d and Cu 3d after adsorbing Li2S6 (Fig. S4 a and b), the Ni-S bond and Cu-S bond peaks appeared at around 862.5 eV and 937.6 eV, respectively, indicating the interaction between metal and LiPSs. Due to the formation of the Sr-S bond, Li-O bond, and M−S bond (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) between bifunctional heterostructure materials STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) and LiPSs, STO@M(M = Fe, Ni, Cu) can effectively adsorb LiPSs and inhibited LiPSs shuttle.However, the peak of Ti element has hardly changed before and after the reaction, and there is no new peak appears (Fig. S4c). Therefore, although the Ti element is also a good element for absorbing polysulfides, in this paper, the Sr element and the O element play a more important role in the adsorption performance of LiPS, and the Ti element mainly plays a role in stabilizing the chemical structure [46]. By fitting the XPS peak areas of Fe, Ni, and Cu, we obtained that the content of Fe (0) in Fe is 47.5%. Since the proportion of Fe element in the whole composite is 2.0%, the proportion of nanoscale transition metal Fe in the whole composite is 1%. Similarly, we obtained that the proportion of nanoscale transition metal Ni in the whole composite is 1.1%, and that of nanoscale transition metal Cu in the whole composite is 0.7%. For nanoscale heterostructured materials STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu), firstly, perovskite substrate can effectively adsorb LiPSs due to its ferroelectric effect. Secondly, in situ exsolved nanoscale transition metals can form M−S (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) bonds with LiPSs, effectively catalyzing the conversion of LiPSs. Through the combination of perovskite and nanoscale transition metals, nanoscale heterostructured materials STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) have excellent characteristics of both perovskite and nanoscale transition metals, so they can effectively adsorb and catalyze the conversion of LiPSs.Since the conversion reaction of LiPSs takes place at the heterointerface, the number of heterointerfaces will indeed affect the conversion efficiency ofLiPSs. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the activity of heterointerfaces and increase heterointerfaces.The heterointerfaces can be increased by increasing the number of in situ exsolved nanoscale transition metal atoms or reducing the size of metal atoms as much as possible. In this paper, it can be seen from TEM that the particle size of in situ exsolved nanoscale transition metal M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) are all about 10 nm, which is small, so heterointerfaces can be effectively increased. Moreover, for catalysts of the same composition, the difference in their surface structure greatly affects their catalytic activity [66]. XRD and TEM results show that the exposed crystal surface of the in situ exsolved nanoscale transition metal M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) has ahighly active (111) crystal surface, so heterointerfaces have high activity. The charge and discharge process of the electrode includes two reaction processes liquid–liquid and liquid–solid. We first investigated the catalytic performance of bifunctional heterostructure materials STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) for SRR and SOR reactions during the liquid–liquid reaction process. A symmetric battery was assembled, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were performed to evaluate the liquid–liquid switching kinetics in SRR and SOR reactions. In the CV curves of the symmetric cells, the reduction current and oxidation current response values were sequentially STO@Cu < STO@Ni < STO@Fe, confirming that the STO@Fe electrode can effectively accelerate not only the SRR reaction kinetics but also has an excellent catalytic effect on the SOR reaction kinetics during the liquid–liquid conversion (Fig. S5). In order to study the catalytic activity of bifunctional heterostructure materials STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) for liquid–solid switching kinetics in SRR and SOR reactions. For the SRR reaction, the nucleation behavior of Li2S on bifunctional heterostructure materials STO@Fe, STO@Ni, and STO@Cu supports were investigated by chronoamperometry (Fig. 4a-c). Through fitting and calculation, the nucleation capacities of Li2S on the bifunctional heterogeneous STO@Fe, STO@Ni, and STO@Cu supports are 144.81, 129.56, and 111.02 mA h g−1, respectively. It is shown that the bifunctional heterostructure material STO@Fe achieves more Li2S deposition than STO@Cu and STO@Ni in the SRR reaction. To study the catalytic performance of bifunctional heterostructure materials STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) for the decomposition of Li2S in the SOR reaction, Li2S decomposition experiments were carried out with bifunctional heterostructure materials STO@Fe, STO@Ni, and STO@Cu as electrodes (Fig. 4d-f). By fitting and calculation, the decomposed capacities of Li2S on the bifunctional heterostructure materials STO@Fe, STO@Ni, and STO@Cu are 103.97, 62.67, and 60.07 mA h g−1, respectively. Among them, the bifunctional heterostructure material STO@Fe has the highest capacity, indicating that the bifunctional heterostructure material STO@Fe can more effectively accelerate the oxidative decomposition rate of Li2S in the SOR reaction. The above results are because in heterostructure materials STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu), the high catalytic nature of in situ exsolved nanoparticles M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) facilitates the conversion reaction kinetics of LiPSs, andprovides abundant active sites. Moreover,the in situ exsolution process provides superior interfacial compatibility between nanometals M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) and the perovskite, thus promoting the synergy of adsorption-catalytic performance. Based on the mechanism of adsorption-catalysis synergy, the strong adsorption of perovskite on persulfate can adsorb polysulfides to the active sites on the surface, and the nanometals M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) on the surface can effectively catalyze the redox reaction of LiPSs into Li2S, promote the rapid conversion of LiPSs and leave the surface of active sites. The vacant active site can continue to combine with new LiPSs, continuously adsorbing and transforming LiPSs. Using bifunctional heterostructure materials STO@Fe, STO@Ni, and STO@Cu as electrodes and carbon paper as current collectors to assemble Li-S batteries for CV testing. CV curves showing catalytic activities of STO@Fe, STO@Ni, and STO@Cu electrodes in SRR and SOR reactions (Fig. 4g). The CV curves of the STO@Fe electrode have higher redox peaks and lower overpotentials. For the SRR reaction, the first reduction peak C1 was analyzed, and the Tafel slopes of the perovskite STO@Fe, STO@Ni, and STO@Cu electrodes were fitted to be 39.4, 42.9, and 52.8 mV dec-1, respectively (Fig. 4h). Tafel curve of the second reduction peak C2 was analyzed, and the Tafel slopes of the perovskite STO@Fe, STO@Ni, and STO@Cu electrodes were fitted to be 22.5, 26.3, and 77.6 mV dec-1, respectively (Fig. S6).For the SOR reaction, the Tafel slopes of the analytical oxidation peak A fit were 92.2, 97.2, and 100.1 mV dec-1, respectively (Fig. 4i). The STO@Fe electrode exhibited the smaller Tafel slope in the SRR and SOR reactions, confirming the good electrocatalytic activity of the STO@Fe electrode in the SRR and SOR reactions. Galvanostatic intermittent titration (GITT) consists of a series of “pulse-galvanostatic-relaxation.” The battery was discharged at 0.02C at a constant current for 1 hour and then allowed to stand for 1 hour to restore the battery to an equilibrium state. The above discharge-stand process was repeated until the battery was discharged to 1.6 V. In the first plateau region of the battery during the discharge process, the voltage change was small after the current was removed, indicating that the electrochemical polarization in this region was not severe (Fig. S7a). In the second discharge plateau region, the difference between the discharge potential of the battery and the open-circuit equilibrium potential becomes larger. It can be observed in the partially enlarged view that the potential difference increases sharply from the reaction to the later stage (Fig. S7b), indicating that the charge transfer ability inside the battery deteriorates and the electrochemical polarization is severe. The difference between the discharge potential and the equilibrium potential of the STO@Fe electrode is smaller, indicating that the bifunctional heterostructure material STO@Fe can accelerate the reaction kinetics of Li-S batteries and reduce the electrochemical polarization. We use bifunctional heterostructure materials STO@Fe, STO@Ni, and STO@Cu as electrodes and carbon paper as current collectors to assemble Li-S batteries. The EDS map shows the uniform distribution of the heterostructure material STO@Fe and S (Fig. S8). To study the rate performance, the STO@Fe, STO@Ni, and STO@Cu batteries were charged and discharged in the range of 0.2-3C. The area loading of sulfur in the rate performance is 1 mg cm−2. Compared with STO@Ni and STO@Cu batteries, STO@Fe batteries have a higher specific capacity in the current density range of 0.2–3C (Fig. 5 a). The discharge specific capacities of the STO@Fe electrodes are 1428, 985, 878, 759, and 630 mA h g−1, respectively, in the current density range of 0.2–3C. And can also maintain a high specific capacity of 524 mA h g−1 even at a high current density of 5C. By comparing the charge–discharge curves at different rates, it is found that the STO@Fe battery has a smaller overpotential (Fig. 5b), while the corresponding STO@Ni and STO@Cu batteries have larger polarization (Fig. S9). At current densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5C, the overpotentials of STO@Fe cells are 0.14, 0.15, 0.17, 0.27, 0.33, and 0.37 V, respectively (Fig. 5c), which are smaller than those of STO@Ni and STO @Cu battery. The above results directly confirm the catalytic effect of the bifunctional heterostructure material STO@Fe for the SRR and SOR reactions of LiPSs. The STO@Fe, STO@Ni, and STO@Cu batteries were cycled at 1C, and the initial specific capacity of the STO@Fe battery was 925 mA h g−1. The high specific capacity of 697 mA h g-1can still be maintained after 400 cycles (Fig. 5d). Meanwhile, the charge–discharge platform remains stable during cycling, which reflects the excellent cycling stability of STO@Fe batteries. In contrast, the initial specific capacities of STO@Ni and STO@Cu batteries are only 781 and 688 mA h g−1, and the capacities decay to 484 and 411 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles, respectively. Among them, the coulombic efficiency of the STO@Ni battery after 400 cycles was lower than 99%, indicating the sluggish discharge reaction kinetics of the STO@Ni battery in the later cycle. But the coulombic efficiency of the STO@Cu battery after 400 cycles was greater than 100%, which was because of the sluggish charging reaction kinetics of the STO@Cu battery. Only the coulombic efficiency of the STO@Fe battery is maintained at about 99.6%, indicating that the bifunctional heterostructure material STO@Fe has faster discharge–charge reaction kinetics. The charge and discharge curves of STO@Ni and STO@Cu batteries were analyzed, and the capacity of the high-voltage platform (S8-Li2S4) was marked as Q H. The capacity of the low-voltage platform (Li2S4-Li2S2/Li2S) was marked as Q L (Fig. S10). The STO@Fe electrode not only had the smallest overpotential but also maintained the highest Q H and Q L values during cycling (Fig. 5e), where the Q H value was 296 mA h g−1, and the Q L value was 626 mA h g−1 in the second cycle. It shows that the bifunctional heterostructure material STO@Fe can effectively promote the SRR and SOR reactions of LiPSs, thereby improving sulfur utilization as the active material. To investigate the effect of the catalytic properties of electrode materials on the cycling stability of Li-S batteries, disassembly experiments were performed on STO@Fe, STO@Ni, and STO@Cu batteries after 400 cycles at 1C. SEM images show that a small amount of inhomogeneously deposited sulfur appears on the surface of both perovskite STO@Ni and STO@Cu electrodes after cycling (Fig. S11b and c). However, the surface of the STO@Fe electrode is relatively flat, and the sulfur and carbon nanotubes are relatively uniformly distributed (Fig. S11a). In addition, compared with STO@Ni and STO@Cu batteries, the Li anode surface of STO@Fe batteries is flatter (Fig. S11d). These results after the cycle demonstrate that the bifunctional heterostructure material STO@Fe can simultaneously catalyze the SRR and SOR reactions of LiPSs, promoting the uniform deposition of charge and discharge products. EIS impedance spectroscopy showed that the charge transfer impedance of the STO@Fe electrode before and after cycling was the smallest, reflecting its excellent cycling stability (Fig. S12). Cathodes with high sulfur loadings (3 and 6 mg cm−2) were prepared to test the rate and cycling performance of STO@Fe electrodes at high sulfur loadings. 3 and 6 mg cm−2 in Fig. 5(f) is based on the loading of S. When sulfur loadings were 3 and 6 mg cm−2, the initial specific capacities of the STO@Fe electrode at 0.1C were 778 and 537 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 5f). The cells were then subjected to rate testing at a current density range of 0.1–1C, followed by long-cycle testing at a current density of 0.2C. The capacities of 553 and 312 mA h g−1 were maintained after 200 cycles, respectively. This result indicates that the STO@Fe electrode can maintain an excellent rate and cycling performance even at higher sulfur loadings. To deeply study the fast charge–discharge performance of the STO@M electrode, the STO@Fe, STO@Ni, and STO@Cu electrodes were rapidly charged and discharged at a high rate of 3C to characterize the cycle performance at high current density. The difference in cycling performance of the STO@Fe, STO@Ni, and STO@Cu electrodes was more prominent at a high current density at 3C (Fig. 5g). The STO@Fe electrode has an initial specific capacity of 672 mA h g−1 even at a high rate of 3C and can maintain a high specific capacity of 353 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles. This result indicates that the STO@Fe electrode has excellent catalytic activity for the SRR and SOR reactions, thereby effectively improving the utilization of active materials, which enables Li-S batteries to remain stable in charge and discharge at higher current densities. Cathodeswitha high sulfur content of about 73 wt% were made to verify the performance promotion effect. The Li-S battery was cycled at rates from 0.1C to 3C and then subjected to a long cycle test at a rate of 1C. The discharge specific capacities of the STO@Fe electrode are 800, 628, 556, 547, and 419 mA h g−1, respectively, in the current density range of 0.2–3C (Fig. S13a). After 250 cycles, the STO@Fe electrode still maintained the capacity of 422 mA h g−1. And when the E/S ratio is 4.5 μL mg−1, the discharge specific capacities of the STO@Fe electrodeare 702, 523, 479, 410, and 357 mA h g−1, respectively, in the current density range of 0.2–3C (Fig. S13b). And the STO@Fe electrode still maintained the capacity of 413 mA h g-1after 250 cycles. It can be seen that the STO@Fe electrode still has excellent cycle stability with high sulfur content and under the condition of lean electrolyte. We made cathodes with Fe metal nanoparticles instead of STO@Fe, assembled the battery under the same conditions, and cycled at 3C. The initial specific capacity of the Fe metal nanoparticles electrode is 315 mA h g−1, lower than the specific capacity of the STO@Fe electrode (Fig. S14a). After 500 cycles at 3C, only 169 mA h g−1 specific capacity remains. Due to the poor adsorption performance of Fe metal nanoparticle electrodes, the coulomb efficiency is lower than 100%. In order to eliminate the influence of CNTs, we have prepared cathodes containing only CNTs and S and the STO@Fe cathode without CNTs respectively. The Li-S battery was subjected to a long cycle test at a rate of 3C. The initial specific capacities of the CNTs electrode and STO@Fe electrode are 302 mA h g−1 and 293 mA h g−1, respectively, which are lower than the STO@Fe electrode. Due to the poor adsorption and catalytic performance of CNT electrodes, and STO@Fe electrodes without CNT have poor electrical conductivity, which will affect their normal charge and discharge. As a result, the coulomb efficiency of the above electrodes will be seriously lower than 100% at the end of the cycle, and the phenomenon of the STO@Fe electrode without CNT is more obvious. In addition, to further exclude the influence of other elements, we use the perovskite STO3 instead of STO@M(M = Fe, Ni, Cu) as the sulfur host to prepare the electrode, and the Li-S battery is cycled at 3C. The results show that the initial specific capacity of STO3 is 347 mA h g−1, after 500 cycles, only 188 mA h g−1 specific capacity remains, far below the STO@Fe electrode (Fig. S14c). Therefore, it can be proved that nanoscale transition metals and perovskite heterostructure materials play an important role in improving Li-S battery performance. Through in situ Raman spectroscopy, we can monitor the species changes of sulfur and LiPSs of Li-S batteries during charging and discharging in real time. When the voltage–time curve was obtained, the collected Raman data was made into a contour map (Fig. 6 a-c). Fig. 6(a) shows that at the open circuit voltage (2.47 V) of the STO@Fe electrode, peaks corresponding to S8 2- at 150, 220, and 475 cm−1 can be observed. During the discharge process of the battery, the peak of S6 2-/S4 2- first increased and then decreased. The changing trend of the charging process is the opposite. Compared with the STO@Fe electrode, the peaks of S6 2-/S4 2- and S4 2-/S3 2- during the charge–discharge process of the STO@Ni electrode (Fig. 6b) and STO@Cu electrode (Fig. 6c) are weaker, and the changes are smaller, indicating that the conversion kinetics of STO@Ni electrode and STO@Cu electrode are slow. When the battery was charged to 2.8 V, a clear peak of S8 2- was detected only in the STO@Fe electrode. The in situ Raman results confirm that nanoscale transition metals in STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) electrodes can effectively catalyze the SRR and SOR reaction kinetics during the charge–discharge process, thereby improving the utilization of sulfur and effectively improve the performance of Li-S batteries. The STO@Fe electrode has the best SRR and SOR reaction kinetics. Fig. 6(d) shows the schematic illustration of the catalytic mechanism of bifunctional heterostructure materials for the SRR and SOR reactions. In Fig. 6(d), the green ball represents the nanoscale transition metals M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) anchored on the surface of perovskite, the blue ball represents Li, and the yellow ball represents S. In the process of discharge, S8 is dissolved, and converted into LiPSs and finally into lithium sulfide. The charging process corresponds to the oxidation of lithium sulfide into LiPSs and the final generation of S8. By comparing the DFT calculation, electrochemical characterization, battery performance test and in situ Raman test results, it can be confirmed that nanoscale metals anchored on the surface of perovskite possess catalytic activity for the SRR reaction corresponding to the discharge process and the SOR reaction corresponding to the charging process, effectively promoting the reduction of LiPSs and the oxidation of lithium sulfide, improving the utilization of sulfur and Li2S. 4 Conclusions In summary, to solve the problem of the slow redox reaction kinetics of LiPSs, we propose the mechanism for nanoscale transition metals catalyzed SRR and SOR reaction kinetics of LiPSs and design heterostructured materials based on this mechanism with nanoscale transition metals anchored on the surface of perovskite oxides STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu), which are then validated by DFT calculations combined with experimental characterization. Nanoscale transition metals were anchored on the surface of perovskite oxides through in-situ exsolution, maintaining good structural stability during charge and discharge. Through a series of adsorption experiments, electrochemical characterizations, and in situ experiments, heterostructured materials STO@M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) were confirmed to have good LiPSs adsorptive performance and excellent catalytic activity for SRR and SOR reactions. Therefore, the bifunctional heterostructure material STO@Fe, as the cathode host, can well meet the needs of rapid charge and discharge cycling of Li-S batteries and achieve stable cycling at high rates. The Li-S battery with STO@Fe as the cathode host can maintain an initial specific capacity of 672 mA h g−1 and a higher specific capacity of 353 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles, even at a high current density of 3C. This study confirms that electrode materials with SRR and SOR catalytic activity have unique performance advantages in Li-S batteries, which can meet the fast charging and discharging of Li-S batteries.

        "dc:description": "To obtain high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, it is necessary to rationally design electrocatalytic materials that can promote efficient sulfur electrochemical reactions. Herein, the robust heterostructured material of nanoscale transition metal anchored on perovskite oxide was designed for efficient catalytic kinetics of the oxidation and reduction reactions of lithium polysulphide (LiPSs), and verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental characterizations. Due to the strong interaction of nanoscale transition metals with LiPSs through chemical coupling, heterostructured materials (STO@M) (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) exhibit excellent catalytic activity for redox reactions of LiPSs. The bifunctional heterostructure material STO@Fe exhibits good rate performance and cycling stability as the cathode host, realizing a high-performance Li-S battery that can maintain stable cycling under rapid charge–discharge cycling. This study presents a novel approach to designing electrocatalytic materials for redox reactions of LiPSs, which promotes the development of fast charge–discharge Li-S batteries.",
