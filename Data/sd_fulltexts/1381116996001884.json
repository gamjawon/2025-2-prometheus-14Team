Although Pd catalysts supported on conventional earners (i.e.. alumina, silica. carbon, etc.) exhibit a satisfactory performance in the above reactions [1-3], a remarkable re- search interest focus up on the development of more selective catalysts. Moreover, the factors controlling the catalytic behaviour of selective hydrogation catalysts as well as the role of the various surface adsorbed C-containing species in the reaction pathways are still under debate. Generally, thermodynamic effects. Corre.spondiiiu author.

En fact, it was ascertained that the electronic and/or morphological properties of metal parti- cles affect the selectivity pallem of Pd catalysts in the hydrogation of acetylene compounds driving to different extents the occurrence of two parallel reaction surface paths which lead to the formation of ethane and ethene as intermedi- ate [7]. Since small metal particles strongly adsorb acetylene compounds, highly dispersed catalysts usually exhibit a lower activity along with a higher selectivity to partial hydroga- tion products [3.6-9]. On this account, various methods for tuning the morphological and/or electronic properties of the Pd-bascd catalysts 1381-1169/96/515.00 Copyright C Wh Eisevier Science B.V. AH riiihts reserved.

Pb [6.10-12] or by selectively 'poisoning' active Pd sites with CO [8.11] or ammonia [13] have been successfully propos' in order to improve their selectivity. Besides, it has been found that the support too plays an important role in determin- ing the activity-selectivity pattern of Pd cata- lysts [1.4,6.13.14]. Namely, taking into account that high surface area carriers generally cause deactivation by carbon deposition, then affect- ing the selectivity during time on stream [1.4.6.13], low specific surface area supports ensure immediately the steady-state catalytic performance and result the most appropriate ones [1.6.14]. Recently. Pd catalysts on low surface area pumice have been effectively tested in partial hydrogation reactions [15.16]: no effects of metal dispersion ( 14-65%) were found on the above systems, neither in terms of spe- cific activity nor of selectivity in the liquid-phase phenylacetylene hydrogation [16]. A peculiar method to improve the reactivity and/or the selectivity of the catalytically active species is to \"immobilize' transition metal derivatives on organic matrices. In an attempt to overcome the limitations related to the known chemical, mechanical and thermal properties of organic matrices, we made to interact some palladium derivatives with the existing chain terminal groups of the olino-p-piteiiyli'iitfr- ephthuluimch' (OPTA) obtaining a system with unique catalytic properties [17.18]. In fact. such 'heterogenized' systems were successfully tested in some model reactions such as hydrogation [19] and oxidation [20] of carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen multiple bonds, achieving high activity and specificity with respect to conven- tional catalytic systems. A TPR investigation of PdCl; catalysts supported on oligomeric amides [21] provided evidence of the 'unusual' strong mettil-Kiipporf interaction which markedly de- presses the reducibility of Pd^ in such sys- tems, This paper is aimed to provide insights into the catalytic behaviour of Pd-derivatives sup- ported on oligomeric aramides in the liquid phase hydrogation of phenylacetylene to >tyrene by a comparative study with conven- tional Pd-supported catalysts (i.e.. Pd/Al^O^. Pd/SiO;. Pd/C). 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts Palladium was added to the OPTA support [20] by wet impregnation for 6 h with a wateracetic acid (9:1) solution of PdCl^ in the appropriate quantities for obtaining catalysts of different metal contents. Pd/Al^O-, and Pd/SiOl systems were prepared by a wet im- pregnation of \"y-AhO, (Ak/o Product, cod. 000-1.5E E) or S\\0-_ (Akzo product, cod. Si 4-5P) supports with a hydrochloric acid solution of PdCl^. After impregnation the latter samples were dried at 110. calcined at 400 for 6 h in air and then reduced at 400 and 800, respectively, for l h in flowing H 3. Pd/C cata- lysts (Chimet Product.

Results and discussion Typical results of phelylacetylene hydroga- tion over 27r PdC^/OPTA reduced at 70 are reported in Fig. 1. Under the adopted experi- mental conditions, styre and ethylbenzene were the only products detected. Results of Fig. 1 also show that the hydro- gation reaction of phenybcetylene is zero order with respect to the substrate, as also con- firmed by runs carried out at different substrate concentrations. Furthermore, the trend of reac- tion rate with the partial pressure of H;, shown in Fig. 2, indicates a reaction order close to one with respect to P^ . The influence of Pd loading of Pd/OPTA (0.2-6 wt% Pd) and Pd/C (1-10 wt% Pd) catalysts, reduced at 70 and 130. on the ap- parent kinetic constant (A\\,pp. mol^n s\"1 gp,,') in phenylacetylene hydrogation at 5 is shown in Fig. 3. It is evident that the Aypp value of Pd/C catalysts is not affected by the reduc- tion temperature (T^) while it increases with the Pd loading according to a straight-line rela- tionship from ca. 8 to 14 mol^n,, s ' SPJ'- ^ contrast, a rise in the reduction temperature from 70 to 130 causes a significant increase of activity in different Pd/OPTA catalysts. Namely, for 7^ = 70 the ^,pp increases of ca. four times going from 0.2 to 2% Pd/OPTA catalysts, thereafter it decreases at higher load- ing levelling off to a value of ca. 4.5 X 10 4 mole H s\"' gpJ'. Meanwhile, the trend of A.ypp with metal loading is featureless for 7,.^ = 130. The selectivity to styre (S^. % = mol styre/(mol styre + mol ethylben/.ene) X 238 /.

It decreases very slowly with conversion and only after almost all phenylacetylene has re- acted ( ^ 95%-). styre is further hydrogenated to ethylber.zene. However, these data show that the nature of the support does not cause remark- able differences in the selectivity pattern of Pd based catalysts in the reaction investigated. In particular, apart from minor differences in the trends, it is noticeable that for all Pd/C systems the selectivity falls from 100 to ca. 90%, while conversion rises from 10 to ca. 100. For low loaded ( < 2%) Pd/OPTA catalysts reduced at 70 the selectivity tends to a limit value of 94-96'^-, whilst for the same systems reduced at -3.4 c- ^ -3.6 ,=\" -4.0 -4.2 -0.4 -0.2 log PH ^atm Fig. 2.

Then, in order to shed light into the peculiar catalytic properties of Pd/OPTA catalysts, characterization data reported in Table 1 must be taken into account. First, according to our previous TPR findings [21], indicating a strong metal-support interaction which inhibits the re- duction of oligoaramides-supported Pd catalysts at lower temperature, the above data show that the fraction of reduced Pd increases with both loading and reduction temperature (7^) though in no case the overall reduction of the supported Pd is attained. The positive influence of the loading and reduction temperature on the degree of reduced Pd leads as a general rule to an increase of about two orders of magnitude in the amount of exposed Pd atoms on .^uch catalysts when the loading increases from 0.2 to 6 wt%. However, to the positive effects of loading and T,.ed on the amount of exposed Pd atoms, it generally corresponds a negative influence of such parameters on the metal dispersion (Table 1). In particular, on varying the loading and 7^, D values ranging between 9 and ca. 60% are observed for Pd/OPTA catalysts (Table 1). In contrast with the singular behaviour of such heterogeniy.ed catalysts, conventional Pd/C, Pd/vAl^O-, and Pd/SiO^ catalysts exhibit a quite regular pattern in that an overall reduction of Pd^ is observed at T> 70 (TPR results not reported here). The metal dispersion of Pd/C catalysts remains practically unchanged (18-24%) on varying the Pd loading between 1 and 10 wt%, while the metal dispersion results to be 33 and 4% for 0.3% Pd^-A^O., and 0.05% Pd/SiO; catalysts, respectively. Therefore, in order to find out whether the metal dispersion and/or the nature of the sup- port affect the specific activity of supported Pd, the values of turnover frequency (TOP, s~1) for all the studied samples are compared in Table 2. These data essentially indicate that the TOP (0.5 s ~ ' ) keeps practically unchanged for differently loaded (1-10 wt%) Pd/C catalysts, resulting equal to that of 0.05% Pd/SiO^, while the TOP value is quite lower for the 0.3% Pd/'v-Al^O, 15.0 SI) '\" 10.0 /\\ /n a\" ._a u i\" / d 10 12 Pd loading. % wt Fig. 3.

Indeed, the presence of either unsaturated aro- matic rings as well as of -NH^ groups in the OPTA structure [17-19] should induce an elec- tron transfer to the metal surface [13] which favours a rapid desorption of styre molecules and consequently ensures high activity and se- lectivity. By contrast, SiO;,, C and to the largest extent -y-Al^O,, supports, could exert an oppo- site electron acceptor effect, which results in a stronger metal-support interaction and in turn depresses the specific activity of Pd particles. system. For the series of Pd/OPTA catalyst no significant trend of TOF values (1.3-2.7 s\"') with the metal dispersion is found, even when D ranges between 9 and 60% (Table 2). On this account the trends in k^ (Fig. 3) with Pd loading are a consequence of the changes pro- duced by such parameter on the reducibility [21] and metal dispersion (Table 1). The fact that TOF is insensitive to Pd dispersion is in good agreement with the findings of Duca et ai. [16] pointing out to a structure msemitn'e character of the title reaction OP Pd/pumice catalysts. with metal dispersion ranging from 0.65 to 0.14. Such a catalytic pattern of Pd/pumice catalysts. was related to the peculiar electron-donor char- acter of the support which confers enhanced metallic features also to small Pd particles [16]. Then. considering that the average TOF value of Pd/OPTA catalysts is 2 0.7. on the whole the latter catalysts result to be much more reac- tive (0.2 < TOF < 0.5 s '). at least at the ^an-ie level of selectivity, than conventional '\".ystems. Indeed, the reactivity scale, drawn on the basis of TOF values reported in Table 2: Pd/OPTAd/SiO^ == Pd/C > Pd/y-ALO,. clearly indicates the occurrence of a support effect on the reactivity of Pd in the liquid-phase phenylacetylene hydrogation. Such an effect. Acknowledgements The AA wish to thank the Italian M.U.R.S.T. and C.N.R. for their financial support. References [I] A.H. Wi?iss. S. Levness. V. Nair. L. Guczi. A. Sarkany and Z.

Fax: +39-90-391518. The catalytic behaviour of palladium supported on oligomeric aramides has been investigated in the liquid phase selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene, by comparison with conventional Pd-supported systems, such as Pd/carbon. Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/SiO2. The influences of the reduction temperature and metal loading on the activity/selectivity behaviour of the title reaction are explained in terms of different reducibility patterns of the catalysts, as well as in the light of a peculiar support effect of the organic matrix on Pd particles.
