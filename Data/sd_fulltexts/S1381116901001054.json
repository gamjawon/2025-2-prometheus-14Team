Tel.: +852-2339-7067; fax: +852-2339-7348 The catalytic performance and characterization of ACuO2−δ (A=Sr0.63Ca0.27) and ACuO2−δ X σ (X=F, Cl) catalysts have been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) to ethene. The results of X-ray diffraction indicated that the three catalysts are single-phase and tetragonal infinite-layer in structure. The incorporation of fluoride or chloride ions in the ACuO2−δ lattice can significantly enhance C2H6 conversion and C2H4 selectivity. At C2H6/O2/N2 molar ratio=2/1/3.7 and space velocity=6000mlh−1 g−1, we observed 73.5% C2H6 conversion, 67.2% C2H4 selectivity, and 49.4% C2H4 yield at 660°C over ACuO1.901F0.088, and 87.4% C2H6 conversion, 74.4% C2H4 selectivity, and 65.0% C2H4 yield at 680°C over ACuO1.950Cl0.036. With the decrease in C2H6/O2 molar ratio, C2H6 conversion increased, whereas C2H4 selectivity decreased. Within 48h of on-stream ODE reaction, the two halide-doped materials exhibited sustainable catalytic performance. Based on the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, O2 temperature-programmed desorption, and C2H6 and C2H6/O2/N2 (2/1/3.7 molar ratio) pulse studies, we conclude that (i) the incorporation of halide ions into the ACuO2−δ lattice could enhance lattice oxygen activity, and (ii) in excessive amount, the O− species accommodated in oxygen vacancies and desorbed below 600°C tend to induce ethane complete oxidation, whereas the lattice oxygen species desorbed above 600°C are active for ethane selective oxidation to ethene. By regulating the oxygen vacancy density and Cu3+ population in the halo-oxide catalyst, one can generate a durable catalyst with good performance for the ODE reaction. Keywords Ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethene ODE reaction Infinite-layer halo-oxide catalyst (Sr0.63Ca0.27)CuO2−δ X σ (X=F, Cl) XPS characterization Superconducting cuprate material 1 Introduction In the past decades, the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) to ethene has been investigated intensively and extensively. Many compounds have been tested as catalysts for this reaction. Among them, Li+−MgO−Cl− seems to be the most effective (ca. 58% C2H4 yield at 620°C) [1]. Although KSr2Bi3O4Cl6 [2], a layered complex compound, gave ca. 70% C2H4 yield at 640°C, the catalyst deteriorated due to Cl leaching. Recently, Takehira et al. [3] investigated a series of La1−x Sr x FeO3−δ catalysts for the ODE reaction and found that SrFeO3−δ showed the best catalytic performance (87% C2H6 conversion, 43% C2H4 selectivity, and 37% C2H4 yield at 650°C). Such a catalytic activity was believed to be associated with the density of oxygen vacancies and the concentration of hypervalent iron cations. Composite oxides such as perovskite-type and perovskite-like oxides are known to be active for the total oxidation of CO and HC (hydrocarbons) [4,5]. The high oxygen vacancy density and strong redox ability of these catalysts play important roles in catalyzing the complete oxidation reactions. Generally speaking, the higher oxygen vacancy density and the stronger the redox ability, the better the composite oxide catalyst performs. If one could decrease the oxygen vacancy density and increase the redox ability by incorporating halide ions (with ionic radii similar to O2− ions) to the vacant oxygen positions, it is possible to convert these combustion materials to catalysts selective for the oxidation of ethane to ethene. Based on this idea, we generated several classes of halide-doped composite oxide catalysts. In our previous studies, we have characterized and reported SrFeO3−δ Cl σ [6], La1−x Sr x FeO3−δ X σ (X=F, Cl) [7] YBa2Cu3O7−δ X σ (X=F, Cl) [8], and hole-doped La1.85Sr0.15CuO4−δ X σ (X=F, Cl) and electron-doped Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO4−δ X σ catalyst [9], which showed good activity and durability for the ODE reaction. The above series of composite oxides exhibit an anionic defect character. To further our investigation, we turned our attention to ACuO2−δ (A=Sr0.63Ca0.27). In the structure of this p-type superconducting material that shows a transition temperature (T c) of up to 110K, there are both cationic and anionic defects [10]. In this study, we report the catalytic performance and characterization of ACuO2−δ X σ (X=F, Cl) as well as ACuO2−δ (for comparison purposes) for the partial oxidation of ethane to ethene. 2 Experimental The ACuO2−δ catalyst was prepared according to the method described by Azuma et al. [10]. Stoichiometric amounts of Sr(NO3)2, Ca(NO3)3·4H2O, and Cu(NO3)2·6H2O (Aldrich, >99.9%) were mixed and calcined at 960°C for a total of 47h with two intermediate grinding. The fluorination or chlorination of ACuO2−δ was carried out in a vacuum (ca. 0.1Torr) furnace first at 350°C for 10h and then at 660°C for 15h by using NH4F or NH4Cl as halogenating reagent [11]. After halogenation, the samples were quenched to room temperature and were in turn ground, tableted, crushed, and sieved to a size range of 80–100mesh. Catalytic activity was tested at 1atm with 0.5g of the catalyst in a fixed-bed quartz micro-reactor (i.d.=4mm); the reaction temperatures were from 520 to 680°C at 20°C intervals. A mixture of ethane (14.8mlmin−1) and air (35.2mlmin−1) was passed through the reactor, corresponding to a contact time of 1.67×10−4 hgml−1 and a C2H6/O2/N2 molar ratio of 2/1/3.7. The product mixture (C2H6, C2H4, CH4, CO, and CO2) was analyzed on-line by gas chromatograph (Shimadzu 8A TCD) with Porapak Q and 5A Molecular Sieve columns. In a blank experiment, quartz sand showed 5.0% C2H6 conversion, 88.0% C2H4 selectivity, and 4.4% C2H4 yield at 680°C, indicating that homogeneous reaction is insignificant at or below 680°C. We observed that further rise in temperature would result in substantial gas-phase reaction. Therefore, the catalytic performances of these materials were examined only at or below 680°C. For the variation of C2H6/O2/N2 molar ratio, the flow rates of C2H6, O2, and N2 were varied at a fixed contact time (1.67×10−4 hgml−1). The crystal structures of the catalysts were determined by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D-MAX, Rigaku) operating at 40kV and 200mA using Cu Kα radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS, Leybold Heraeus, VG CLAM 4 MCD Analyzer) technique with Mg Kα (hν=1253.6eV) being the excitation source was used to determine the Cu 2p3/2 and O 1s binding energies of surface copper and oxygen species, respectively. The instrumental resolution was 0.5eV. Before XPS measurements, the samples were calcined in O2 (flow rate, 20mlmin−1) at 850°C for 1h and then cooled in O2 to room temperature, followed by treatments in He (20mlmin−1) at a desired temperature for 1h and then cooled in He to room temperature. Finally, the samples were outgassed in the primary vacuum chamber (10−5 Torr) for 0.5h and then introduced into the ultrahigh vacuum chamber for recording. The C 1s line at 284.6eV was taken as a reference for binding energy calibration. The specific surface areas of the catalysts were measured using a Nova 1200 apparatus. The O2-TPD (temperature-programmed desorption) experiments were performed according to the methods described in [12]. The temperature range was from room temperature to 950°C and the heating rate was 10°Cmin−1. The amount of O2 desorbed from the catalysts was quantified by calibrating the peak areas against that of a standard pulse. We performed pulse experiments to investigate the reactivity of surface oxygen species. A catalyst sample (0.2g) was placed in a micro-reactor and was thermally treated at a desired temperature for 30min before the pulsing of C2H6 or C2H6/O2/N2 (2/1/3.7 molar ratio), and the effluent was analyzed on-line by a mass spectrometer (HP G1800A). The pulse size was 65.7μl (at 25°C, 1atm) and He (HKO Co., >99.995%) was the carrier gas. The contents of halogen and Cu3+ or Cu+ were determined by adopting the methods previously described [8,13]. The experimental errors are ±0.05% for halide analysis and ±0.5% for Cu3+ and Cu+ titrations. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst compositions, surface areas, structures, and catalytic performance Table 1 shows the structures, compositions, and surface areas of ACuO2−δ and ACuO2−δ X σ . According to the Cu3+ and halogen contents as well as with the assumption of preserving electroneutrality, the value of δ was calculated to be 0.074 for ACuO2−δ , whereas the values of δ and σ were estimated to be 0.099 and 0.088 for ACuO2−δ F σ , 0.050 and 0.036 for ACuO2−δ Cl σ , respectively. The amount of nonstoichiometric oxygen was 0.074 for ACuO1.926, 0.011 for ACuO1.901F0.088, and 0.014 for ACuO1.950Cl0.036. From Table 1, one can observe that the inclusion of halide ions in ACuO2−δ induced a rise in Cu3+ content and a decrease in oxygen vacancy density with no significant decline in surface area; there were also no significant changes in F or Cl content of the halogenated catalyst before and after 48h of on-stream reaction. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of ACuO1.926 and ACuO2−δ X σ . Besides a trace amount of the (Sr, Ca)14Cu24O41 phase, the three catalysts could be considered as single-phase and are tetragonal infinite-layer in structure (as indexed in Fig. 1b and c), in good agreement with those reported in the literature [10,14,15]. The similarity in crystal structure of the undoped (Fig. 1a) and halide-doped (Fig. 1b and c) materials indicates that the halide ions were incorporated into the ACuO2−δ lattice. Fig. 2 shows the catalytic performance of ACuO1.926 and ACuO2−δ X σ (X=F, Cl) after 1h of on-stream ODE reaction. Over the undoped catalyst (Fig. 2a), with the rise in reaction temperature, the C2H6 conversion, O2 conversion, C2H4 selectivity, C2H4 yield, and CH4 selectivity increased, whereas CO x (i.e. CO+CO2) selectivity decreased. Over the ACuO1.901F0.088 catalyst (Fig. 2b), when the temperature was raised from 520 to 680°C, C2H6 and O2 conversions and CH4 selectivity increased, and C2H4 selectivity and C2H4 yield first increased and then decreased, reaching a maximal value of 68.8% (at 620°C) and 49.4% (at 660°C), respectively, whereas CO x selectivity first decreased and then increased, reaching a minimal value of 28.7% at 660°C. Over the ACuO1.950Cl0.036 catalyst (Fig. 2c), similar trends were observed: with the rise in temperature, C2H6 and O2 conversions, and CH4 selectivity augmented, the maximal C2H4 selectivity (74.4%) and C2H4 yield (65.0%) appeared at 680°C where CO x selectivity reached a minimal value of 21.1%. Similar results were obtained when each of the two halo-oxide catalysts was well dispersed in quartz sand (0.5g catalyst per 5.0g quartz sand). This indicates that the problem of hot spots was insignificant. The formation of CH4 requires the breakage of CC bond. Kennedy and Cant [16] proposed that CH4 could be generated via (i) C2H6 decomposition in the gas phase and (ii) a heterogeneous pathway involving an ethylperoxy intermediate. In the latter case, ethylperoxy reacted with surface oxygen species to form CH4 and HCO2, and the HCO2 species were further oxidized to CO x and H2O. Based on these results, one can conclude that the ACuO2−δ X σ catalysts are much superior to the ACuO1.926 catalyst in catalyzing the ODE reaction. In the lifetime studies, we examined the catalytic performance of ACuO1.901F0.088 and ACuO1.950Cl0.036 in 48h of on-stream reaction. It is observed that both catalysts displayed stable behaviors (Fig. 3 ). As shown in Table 1, the F or Cl contents of the fresh and used (after 48h of reaction) halide-incorporated catalysts were rather similar, implying that the ACuO2−δ X σ catalysts were rather intact after 48h. In the studies of the effects of C2H6/O2/N2 molar ratio on the catalytic performance of ACuO1.901F0.088 (at 660°C) and ACuO1.950Cl0.036 (at 680°C), we observed that with the variation of C2H6/O2/N2 molar ratio from 1/2/3.7 to 2/1/3.7, C2H6 conversion and CO x selectivity decreased from 75.8 and 33.2% to 73.5 and 28.7% over the F-doped catalyst, and from 89.9 and 27.2% to 87.4 and 21.1% over the Cl-doped catalyst, respectively, whereas O2 conversion, C2H4 selectivity, and C2H4 yield increased from 27.6, 64.1, and 48.6% to 92.5, 67.2, and 49.4% over the former catalyst and from 29.9, 69.8, and 62.8% to 97.4, 74.4, and 65.0% over the latter catalyst, respectively. In order to investigate the reactivity of C2H4 towards O2 over the three catalysts, we carried out C2H4 oxidation experiments under reaction conditions similar to those in the C2H6 oxidation reaction, and the results are listed in Table 2 . One can observe that the C2H4 conversion was 18.4% over the F-doped catalyst and 14.2% over the Cl-doped catalyst, whereas over ACuO1.926, it was 32.6%. Furthermore, the CO/CO2 ratios in the product mixture observed over ACuO2−δ X σ were much higher than that observed over ACuO1.926. Lunsford et al. [17] pointed out that C2H4 was the major carbon source for CO x formation at or above 650°C. As revealed in the studies of the effects of C2H6/O2/N2 molar ratio on the ODE performance, the two halide-doped catalysts exhibited the same variation trend in reactant conversions and product selectivities with the change in C2H6/O2/N2 molar ratio; the rise of O2 concentration in the feedstock caused an increase in C2H6 conversion but a decrease in C2H4 selectivity. The C2H6/O2 molar ratio required for the selective oxidation of C2H6 to C2H4 is 2/1. An excessive amount of O2 would be unfavorable for the ODE reaction at high temperatures (>660°C). The increase in selectivity towards one of the products with the increase in reactant conversion is unusual in heterogeneous catalysis. However, if the C2H4 deep oxidation was reduced or suppressed, C2H4 selectivity would be enhanced. In C2H6 oxidation at a particular O2 conversion, the simultaneous augmentation in C2H4 selectivity and C2H6 conversion is due to a reduction in C2H4 deep oxidation (Table 2). 3.2 Copper oxidation state, oxygen vacancy density, and halide location In the ideal crystal structure of Sr1−x Ca x CuO2, there are no cationic and anionic defects and the oxidation state of Cu is 2+. On the ground of preserving electroneutrality, the existence of cationic defects would give rise to the rise in Cu oxidation state (which favors the redox process of the catalyst [18]) and/or the formation of oxygen vacancies (which favors the deep oxidation of HC [4,5]). Theoretically, the halide ions incorporated into the ACuO2−δ lattice could (i) replace some of the O2− ions, (ii) occupy oxygen vacancies, or (iii) dwell at interstitial sites. If a F− or Cl− ion replaces an O2− ion, to maintain electroneutrality, the oxidation state of an adjacent copper ion has to drop; if a halide ion occupies an oxygen vacancy or an interstitial position, it would cause the oxidation state of an adjacent copper ion to rise. As a matter of fact, the introduction of F− or Cl− ions into ACuO2−δ caused the Cu3+ contents to increase rather than to decrease (Table 1), demonstrating that the halide ions have occupied a certain amount of oxygen vacancies and/or interstitial spacings [19,20]. Summarized in Table 3 are the changes of Cu3+ contents in ACuO1.926, ACuO1.901F0.088, and ACuO1.950Cl0.036 under various thermal treatments. With a rise in temperature from 520 to 680°C in a He atmosphere, the Cu3+ content decreased significantly. It indicates that the abatement in Cu3+ content is induced by the desorption of oxygen species on/in the catalysts. Exposing the treated samples to an oxygen flow at the same temperature for 30min restored the Cu3+ contents to their former values (Table 1), indicating that the Cu3+ amounts could be replenished via the oxidation of Cu2+. There was no significant change in halide content when the catalysts were heated in He at 800°C for 30min. These results indicate that in an oxygen-deprived atmosphere, the drop in Cu3+ content is due to the desorption of oxygen species. Fig. 4 shows the Cu 2p3/2 spectra of the ACuO1.926 and ACuO2−δ X σ samples which had been treated in He at 520, 580, and 680°C, respectively. It is observed that the intensities of the shake-up satellite signals increased with the rise in treatment temperature, possibly associated with the increase in Cu2+ concentration due to the desorption of oxygen at elevated temperatures. The shake-up satellites observed in the Cu 2p3/2 spectra (Fig. 4) were caused by the charge transferred from neighboring oxygen ligands into an empty d-state of Cu2+ ion [21]. The Cu 2p3/2 binding energy was at ca. 933.5eV for the halogen-free and halogen-containing catalysts. Since the binding energy of the 2p electrons of Cu3+ is larger than that of Cu2+ (ca. 933.5eV) or Cu+ (ca. 932.7eV) [22], the peak corresponding to Cu3+ is expected to appear at a higher binding energy. From Fig. 4, one can observe a shoulder peak at ca. 935.0eV, denoting the presence of Cu3+ in these catalysts; furthermore, the signal of Cu3+ ions decreased in intensity with the rise in treatment temperature and disappeared at 680°C, indicating that the concentration of Cu3+ ions decreased upon heating in He. The results of the analyses of copper oxidation state support the assignment. The negative results in Cu+ analysis and the absence of signals due to Cu+ ions in XPS analysis exclude the idea of Cu+ presence in these samples. The above results confirm that there are only Cu2+ and Cu3+ ions in ACuO1.926 and ACuO2−δ X σ . Shown in Fig. 5 are the O 1s XPS spectra of the ACuO1.926, ACuO1.901F0.088, and ACuO1.950Cl0.036 samples treated in He at 520, 580, and 680°C, respectively. There are two O 1s peaks at 528.5–529 and 531.0eV for the three samples treated at 520°C. We assign the signal at lower binding energy to surface lattice oxygen and the one at higher binding energy to adsorbed oxygen species such as O− [23–26]. In view that the O 1s binding energy of OH− falls in the 531–532eV range, we heated the samples in an oxygen flow at 850°C for 1h before XPS measurement in order to eliminate the presence of OH−. Furthermore, due to the fact that there was no C 1s signal at ca. 289.5eV (binding energy), the possible presence of surface carbonates can be discarded. There is only one O 1s peak at ca. 529.5eV (binding energy) for the ACuO1.901F0.088 and ACuO1.950Cl0.036 samples treated in He at 580 and 680°C (Fig. 5IIb, IIc, IIIb, and IIIc); it could be assigned to surface lattice oxygen [23–26]. As for the halogen-free ACuO1.926 catalyst, with the rise of treatment temperature, the component at ca. 531.0eV decreased markedly in intensity and disappeared after treatment at 680°C, whereas the intensity of the component at ca. 528.5eV increased (Fig. 5I). From the O 1s spectra, one can observe that the O 1s binding energy of the lattice oxygen in ACuO1.901F0.088 (ca. 529.5eV) and ACuO1.950Cl0.036 (ca. 529.5eV) was 1.0eV higher than that (ca. 528.5eV) in ACuO1.926. It might be due to the differences in (i) electronegativity between F and O (which would cause the valence electron density of O2− to decrease and the O 1s binding energy of O2− to rise), and (ii) ionic radii between Cl− and O2− (which would induce the enlargement of the oxide lattice [7–9]). In both cases, the coulombic force between a copper ion and an O2− ion would be weakened. As a result, lattice O2− ions become more active. In other words, the inclusion of F− or Cl− ions in ACuO2−δ enhances the activity of lattice oxygen. The increase in C2H4 selectivity over the halide-doped catalysts (Fig. 2b and c) is a supporting evidence for this viewpoint. The pioneering work of Ovshinsky et al. [27] initiated a great interest in the investigation of the consequences of anion isomorphism in high-temperature superconductors. Many efforts have been focused on the study of physical properties of these halogenated materials, such as crystal structures, magnetic nature, and superconductivity. It is important to confirm the presence and location of halogen atoms in the crystal lattice. Works on fluorinated YBa2Cu3O7−δ [28–31] manifest that the incorporated halogen atoms occupy the vacant oxygen positions in the Cu(1) plane where the Cu3+ ions are also located [32]. Fig. 6 shows the schematic crystal structure of ACuO2−δ . This unit cell contains two-dimensional CuO2 sheets that are apparently essential to the high-T c superconductivity, with the charge carriers arising from the Ca and Sr vacancies. The defect layer could be formulated as CuO2/A1−x /CuO2−δ /A1−x /CuO2 (x>0.1) [10]. Compared to O2− (1.40Å) ions, F− (1.38Å) ions are slightly smaller, but Cl− (1.81Å) ions are larger in size. Besides occupying the oxygen vacancies, the F− ions could also dwell at interstitial positions as reported in Sr2CuO2F2+δ [33] or even replace a certain amount of lattice O2− ions. In the first two cases, the Cu3+ concentration would increase; in the last case, however, it would cause the Cu3+ population to decrease. The fact that the Cu3+ content in the F-doped catalyst (Table 1) was lower than that in the Cl-doped catalyst suggests that (i) there was certain extent of O2− replacement by F− ions, and (ii) the incorporated Cl− ions could only occupy the oxygen vacancies. 3.3 Active oxygen species After calcination in an O2-containing atmosphere, the oxygen vacancies in a catalyst would usually be occupied by dissociatively adsorbed oxygen (O−). Seiyama et al. [25] determined the exact oxygen composition of La1−x Sr x CoO3−δ (x=0–1) before and after the respective desorption peaks, and concluded that a certain amount of Co4+ ion was actually induced by the O− located at oxygen vacancies. In the calcined ACuO2−δ catalysts, some Cu3+ ions were formed due to the occupancy of oxygen vacancies by O−. Rao [34] reported that there were O− species settled in the oxygen holes in YBa2Cu3O7−δ . The detection of the O 1s signal at ca. 531.0eV binding energy (Fig. 5) indicates the presence of O− on/in the ACuO1.926 and ACuO2−δ X σ catalysts. These results demonstrate that there were O− species accommodated in the oxygen vacancies of the catalysts, driving the Cu3+ contents to rise. Compared to ACuO1.926, the F- or Cl-doped catalyst showed a weaker signal of O−, because a lesser amount of oxygen vacancies are available in the halogen-doped catalysts. Most perovskites (ABO3) exhibit a characteristic O2-TPD profile with α- and β-oxygen desorptions. The α-oxygen is accommodated in oxygen vacancies [25,34–36] and is responsible for the complete oxidation of HC; the β-oxygen (i.e. Olattice 2−) is attributed to the partial reduction of B-site cation and is responsible for the selective oxidation of HC [35,36]. The inclusion of F− or Cl− ions in the ACuO2−δ lattice would result in a decrease in oxygen vacancy population (thus decreasing the amount of α-oxygen) and a rise in Cu3+ content (thus increasing β-oxygen desorption). As shown in Table 1, the doping of F− or Cl− ions into ACuO2−δ led to an increase rather than a decrease in Cu3+ content, implying that the F− or Cl− ions have occupied a certain amount of oxygen vacancies and/or interstitial sites. Fig. 7 shows the O2-TPD profiles of ACuO1.926 and ACuO2−δ X σ . There were desorptions at 518 (20.6μmol(gcat)−1), 798, 870, and 938°C for ACuO1.926 (Fig. 7a), at 522 (6.4μmol(gcat)−1), 618, 701, and 721°C for ACuO1.901F0.088 (Fig. 7b), and at 528 (8.2μmol(gcat)−1), 686, and 710°C for ACuO1.950Cl0.036 (Fig. 7c). According to the nature of desorbed oxygen species, the peak in the range of 518−528°C could be assigned to α-oxygen, whereas the ones in the range of 618−938°C to β-oxygen. The results of O 1s XPS studies confirm such assignments. The amount of desorbed β-oxygen below 950°C was 56.6μmol(gcat)−1 for ACuO1.926, 98.9μmol(gcat)−1 for ACuO1.901F0.088, and 86.1μmol(gcat)−1 for ACuO1.950Cl0.036. The results of O2-TPD investigations clearly indicate that with the addition of F− or Cl− ions to ACuO2−δ , the content of α-oxygen decreased, whereas that of β-oxygen increased; moreover, the desorption temperature of the β-oxygen was considerably lowered. Therefore, we suggest that the incorporation of F− or Cl− ions into the ACuO2−δ lattice has caused the bulk oxygen vacancy density to decrease (decreasing the amount of α-oxygen) and the lattice oxygen activity to enhance (increasing the amount of β-oxygen), and the complete oxidation reactions were reduced as a result. Passing oxygen through the catalysts which had just been thermally treated in He (Table 3) would restore the Cu3+ contents to the former values (Table 1). The results demonstrate that the oxygen consumed in the ODE reaction could be replenished by the oxygen from the gas phase according to the following sequence: O 2 (g)⇔O 2 − (ads)⇔O 2 2−(ads)⇔2O vacancy −(ads)⇔2O 2−(ads)⇔2O lattice 2− When the treatment temperature was raised from 580 to 720°C, with the removal of Olattice 2− from these three catalysts due to the partial reduction of Cu3+ ions, the oxygen vacancy density increased, favoring the transformation of gaseous oxygen to Olattice 2−; as a result, the Olattice 2− loss induced by Cu3+ reduction is compensated. Table 4 summarizes the C2H6 conversions and C2H4 selectivities when the thermally treated ACuO1.926, ACuO1.901F0.088, and ACuO1.950Cl0.036 samples were exposed, respectively, to a C2H6 or C2H6/O2/N2 (molar ratio=2/1/3.7) pulse at various temperatures. In both cases, with a rise in treatment temperature from 520 to 720°C, C2H4 selectivity and C2H6 conversion increased significantly over the three catalysts. When a C2H6 pulse was introduced, respectively, to the three catalysts at 520°C, ACuO1.926 showed the highest C2H6 conversion but the poorest C2H4 selectivity, confirming that the α-oxygen (Ovacancy −) tends to induce the complete oxidation of C2H6 and C2H4. At 580, 620, or 720°C, C2H6 conversion and C2H4 selectivity recorded in a pulse of C2H6 or in a pulse of C2H6/O2/N2 increased significantly over the three catalysts, indicating that the β-oxygen (Olattice 2−) is accountable for the selective oxidation of C2H6 to C2H4. Considering the nature and functions of oxygen species on/in the ACuO1.926, ACuO1.901F0.088, and ACuO1.950Cl0.036 catalysts, it is clear that in excessive amount, the Ovacancy − is prone to induce ethane deep oxidation, whereas the Olattice 2− is responsible for ethane selective oxidation to ethene. 4 Conclusions Based on the above results and discussion, we conclude as follows: (i) the halogenated ACuO2−δ catalysts are tetragonal infinite-layer in structure; (ii) the addition of fluoride or chloride ions to ACuO2−δ significantly enhanced C2H4 selectivity and C2H6 conversion; (iii) the inclusion of halide ions in the ACuO2−δ lattice could promote lattice oxygen activity; (iv) in excessive amount, the mono-oxygen (O−) species desorbed below 600°C are prone to induce total oxidation, whereas the lattice oxygen species desorbed above 600°C favor selective oxidation of C2H6 to C2H4; (v) the good and sustainable catalytic behavior of the F- or Cl-doped infinite-layer halo-oxides could be associated with the drop in oxygen vacancy density and the rise in Cu3+ population.

        "dc:description": "The catalytic performance and characterization of ACuO2−δ (A=Sr0.63Ca0.27) and ACuO2−δ X σ (X=F, Cl) catalysts have been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) to ethene. The results of X-ray diffraction indicated that the three catalysts are single-phase and tetragonal infinite-layer in structure. The incorporation of fluoride or chloride ions in the ACuO2−δ lattice can significantly enhance C2H6 conversion and C2H4 selectivity. At C2H6/O2/N2 molar ratio=2/1/3.7 and space velocity=6000mlh−1 g−1, we observed 73.5% C2H6 conversion, 67.2% C2H4 selectivity, and 49.4% C2H4 yield at 660°C over ACuO1.901F0.088, and 87.4% C2H6 conversion, 74.4% C2H4 selectivity, and 65.0% C2H4 yield at 680°C over ACuO1.950Cl0.036. With the decrease in C2H6/O2 molar ratio, C2H6 conversion increased, whereas C2H4 selectivity decreased. Within 48h of on-stream ODE reaction, the two halide-doped materials exhibited sustainable catalytic performance. Based on the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, O2 temperature-programmed desorption, and C2H6 and C2H6/O2/N2 (2/1/3.7 molar ratio) pulse studies, we conclude that (i) the incorporation of halide ions into the ACuO2−δ lattice could enhance lattice oxygen activity, and (ii) in excessive amount, the O− species accommodated in oxygen vacancies and desorbed below 600°C tend to induce ethane complete oxidation, whereas the lattice oxygen species desorbed above 600°C are active for ethane selective oxidation to ethene. By regulating the oxygen vacancy density and Cu3+ population in the halo-oxide catalyst, one can generate a durable catalyst with good performance for the ODE reaction.",
