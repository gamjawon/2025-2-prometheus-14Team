Key Laboratory of Coal Processing and Efficient Utilization Ministry of Education China University of Mining & Technology Xuzhou Jiangsu 221116 China Graphical abstract Co–Zn/NC was prepared by a sacrificial template self-reduction method with zeolitic imidazolate frame-8 (ZIF-8) impregnating the Co2+ as the precursor. At 125 °C for 2.5 h, furfural was completely converted to furan-2-ylmethanol (FM) over Co17Zn/NC600, while FM selectivity over Co/NC600 is only 70.6%. According to multiple characterizations, Co17Zn/NC600 (Co loading 17%, calcined at 600 °C) consists of flower-like spherical Co3ZnC nanoparticles (NPsCo3ZnC) uniformly distributed on its surface. The NPsCo3ZnC are the main active ingredients for highly selective furfural hydrogenation to FM, which is confirmed by furfural hydrogenation over Co–Zn/NC prepared with different Co loadings and different calcination temperatures. The excellent activity and stability of Co17Zn/NC600 were confirmed by recycling experiment and furfural conversion is still above 90% after repeated use of Co17Zn/NC600 for 8 cycles. Keywords Furfural Selective hydrogenation Co–Zn/NC and Co/NC catalysts Zeolitic imidazolate frame-8 Co3 ZnC and Co nanoparticles 1 Introduction Biomass is widely investigated and applied to produce bio-based fuels, chemicals, and materials [1]. However, because of its structural complexity, the reasonable utilization of biomass faces multiple difficulties. On the one hand, there is an urgent need to change the physicochemical properties of biomass to improve the quality of bio-based fuels [2]. On the other hand, the production of fine chemicals from biomass, especially biomass molecular platform compounds (BMMPFCs), as an alternative or supplement to petrochemical products needs to be developed [3,4]. Furfural, as a BMMPFC, could be applied in producing a series of value-added chemicals through hydrogenation, condensation, deoxygenation, oxidization, and esterification [5–8]. More than half of furfural is used to produce furan-2-ylmethanol (FM) [8,9], which is a vital raw material or intermediate for producing polymer resins, polyurethanes, levulinic acid, valerolactone, and (tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methanol (THFM) [10,11]. The key to furfural hydrogenation (FH) into FM is to design and develop a highly active and selective catalyst. Cr-based catalysts have been widely applied for FH to FM in industry [12,13], but they are destructive to environment and human body. Although various precious metals, such as Pd, Pt, and Ru, have been extensively investigated [14–17], these noble metals are extremely expensive for FH in industry and their selectivity is also not satisfactory. Ni, Co, Cu, Fe, and other non-precious metals are still preferred for highly selective FH to FM [18–22], but the activity and selectivity of traditional non-noble metal for selective FH are relatively poor. Therefore, exploring effective and selective non-precious metal catalysts is an urgent requirement for FH. Zeolitic imidazolate frame (ZIF) are formed via self-assembly of organic ligands and metal ions through coordination bonds [23–28], which not only have ultra-high porosity but also have adjustable or controllable pore structure [29–31]. However, the application of ZIFs in heterogeneous catalysis has not led to any huge breakthrough so far due to their poor stability and fewer active sites [32–34]. Therefore, the improvement of ZIFs, especially using ZIFs as a sacrificial template, was paid more and more attention [35–38]. In this work, Co17Zn/NC600 was prepared via a sacrificial template self-reduction method with Co17/ZIF-8 as the precursor at 600 °C of calcination temperature (CT) for selective FH. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Methanol (99.7%), isopropanol (IP, 99.7%), ethanol (99.7%), propanol (99.5%), 2-methylimidazole (99.0%), furfural (99.0%), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (99.0%), benzaldehyde (98.5%), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (98.5%), FM (98.5%), cinnamaldehyde (98.0%), 2-pyrrolecarbaldehyde (98.0%), pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde (98.0%), 2-thenaldehyde (98.0%), and n-hexane (97.0%) were purchased from Sinopharma Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd and used without purification. 2.2 Catalyst preparation ZIF-8 was prepared via a stirring method [37,39]. Generally, 0.7 g 2-methylimidazole and 1.0 g Zn(NO3)2·6H2O were mixed in 25 and 30 mL deionized water, respectively. Both mixtures were mixed and stirred at 30 °C for 8 h followed by filtration and then washing and drying in vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain ZIF-8. In addition, ZIF-67 was prepared using the same method with 2-methylimidazole and Co(NO3)2·6H2O. Co17Zn/NC600 was prepared by calcining and self-reducing Co17/ZIF-8. First, 1.0 g ZIF-8 was dispersed in 150 mL ethanol with 0.49 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O and stirred at 30 °C for 12 h followed by filtration and then washing and drying in vacuum to afford Co17/ZIF-8. Next, 1.9 g Co17Zn/NC600 was prepared by calcining 3 g Co17/ZIF-8 in a N2 stream at 600 °C for 6 h. Co/NC600 and Zn/NC600 were obtained by calcining ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 with the yields of 65 and 63%, respectively. Other Cox/ZIF-8 and CoxZn/NCy were obtained by the same method, where x and y represents the mass fraction of Co and CT of Cox/ZIF-8, respectively. 2.3 Catalytic reaction A substrate (50 μL), solvent (10 mL), and catalyst (50 mg) were sequentially placed into a 60 mL reactor. Then H2 or N2 is charged into the reactor to make the reaction system reach to certain initial H2 pressure (IHP) or initial N2 pressure (INP). After the reaction was completed under certain conditions, the reaction mixture was analyzed with a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer. 2.4 Catalyst characterizations The catalysts were characterized with X-ray diffractometer, thermogravimetric analyzer, scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, specific surface and aperture measuring instrument, X-ray photoelectron spectroscope, adsorption analyzer, and transmission electron microscope. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Morphologies and textures of the catalysts X-ray diffraction patterns indicate the ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 are successfully synthesized (Fig. S1). Fig. S2 shows that ZIF-8 and Co17/ZIF-8 undergo rapid mass loss at 230 and 240 °C, respectively. Although rapid mass loss occurred again at 530 °C, the thermal stability of Co17/ZIF-8 is still good, which is conducive to the structural stability of Co17Zn/NC600 and the high dispersity of supported metals and metal nodes. In Fig. 1 , the surface of ZIF-8 is very smooth, while that of Co17/ZIF-8 is petal-shaped with clearly visible holes uniformly distributed and the overall shape of Co17/ZIF-8 is flower-spherical due to the further reaction of Co2+ with ZIF-8. In addition, Co17Zn/NC600 prepared by calcining Co17/ZIF-8 still maintains a flower-spherical structure, which is beneficial to the structural stability and the high metal dispersity. As shown in Fig. S3, the pore diameter of Co17Zn/NC600 is significantly larger than that of Co17/ZIF-8 and there are more mesopores and macropores in Co17Zn/NC600 than in Co17/ZIF-8. In addition, there are highly dispersed C, N, O, Co, and Zn elements on the surface of Co17Zn/NC600 (Fig. S4). As Fig. 2 and Table S1 shows, Co element was successfully loaded in Co17Zn/NC600, which contains pyridine, pyrrole, and graphitic nitrogen, facilitating the metal dispersion. In addition, Zn 2p shows a distinct peak of ZnO and the peaks of Co 2p at 780.2, 781.0, 781.9, 794.5 and 795.9 eV correspond to CoOx species [40–43], while the peak of Co 2p at 778.2 and 793.4 eV could be attributed to Co° [42,44]. As exhibited in Fig. 3 , the diffraction peaks from Co17Zn/NC600 at 31.7, 34.4, 36.3, 47.5, 56.6, 62.8, 66.4, 67.9, and 69.7° (PDF#36-1451) are from ZnO, while those at 33.9, 41.9, 48.8, 71.5, and 86.5° (PDF#29-0524) are from NPsCo3ZnC. Both Zn/NC600 and Co/NC600 exhibit only ZnO and metallic Co peaks, and metallic Co peak appears at 44.2, 51.5, and 75.8° (PDF#15-0806). As Fig. 4 displays, Zn/NC600 has 3 different acidic sites releasing adsorbed NH3 at 150–300, 500–700, and 700−900 °C, respectively, and Co17Zn/NC600 has also acidic sites releasing adsorbed NH3 at 150–300 and 700–900 °C derived from ZnO, which could be beneficial for Co17Zn/NC600 to adsorb furfural. Co–Zn/NC catalysts prepared at different CTs have highly dispersed NPsCo3ZnC and the crystal lattice stripes of NPsCo3ZnC at 110, 111, and 220 crystal planes are 0.206, 0.232, and 0.376 nm (Figs 5 and 6 ), further confirming that Co was successfully loaded. The average particle size of NPsCo3ZnC increases significantly with raising CT. At CTs lower than 600 °C, the average particle diameter of Co3ZnC is less than 21 nm, while at 700 °C of CT, NPsCo3ZnC were significantly agglomerated and their average particle diameter increases sharply to 38.6 nm (Fig. 5). 3.2 Effect of CT and Co loading of Co–Zn/NC on FH As displayed in Fig. 7 , with raising CT from 400 to 600 °C, furfural conversion (FC) increases to 100% but decreases to 41.0% with raising CT to 700 °C due to the agglomeration of NPsCo3ZnC at high CTs (Fig. 5), while increasing Co loading in Co–Zn/NC600 increases FC. Furfural was not converted over Co5Zn/NC600. Although FC is 16.8% over Co9Zn/NC600, FMS reaches 100%. With increasing Co loading to 17%, FC increases to 97.6% with FM as the only product. Although furfural can be completely converted over Co/NC600, FM selectivity (FMS) is not higher than 80%, indicating furfural can be specifically hydrogenated to FM over NPsCo3ZnC in Co–Zn/NC (Fig. S5) rather than over Co nanoparticles (NPsCo) in Co/NC600. These results suggest that the strong interaction of Co with Zn significantly improves the selective FH to FM. Therefore, Co17Zn/NC600 was selected to optimize the reaction conditions for FH to FM. 3.3 Effect of solvent on FH over Co17Zn/NC600 and Co/NC600 As shown in Fig. 8 , FC is higher than 90% over Co17Zn/NC600 at 140 °C in all the solvents used and FM is the only product in n-hexane, ethanol, and IP, but ring-opened species are the main products and FM was not produced in water. FMSs are 79.9% and 92.5% in methanol and butanol, respectively. These results indicate that highly polar solvents are not effective for selective FH to FM over Co17Zn/NC600. Over Co/NC600 in ethanol at 125 °C, furfural was completely converted, but FMS in ethanol is significantly lower than that in either methanol or IP. FMSs are much lower in other solvents, especially in water and n-hexane, due to FM hydrogenation to THFM and subsequent ring-opening reactions (RORs) shown in Scheme 1 . Remarkably, in ethanol, there is almost no acetylation product in FH over Co17Zn/NC600 but acetylation is a common reaction during FH over Co/NC600, which could be the result of interaction between furfural and ethanol over Co/NC600 [45]. 3.4 Effects of other conditions on FH over Co17Zn/NC600 and Co/NC600 As displayed in Table S2, FC increases with increasing IHP over Co17Zn/NC600 and Co/NC600. Interestingly, without H2 furfural was not converted at all over Co17Zn/NC600, indicating furfural cannot be hydrogenated only through the solvent as a source of hydrogen and H2 plays a crucial role in FH over Co17Zn/NC600. As shown in Fig. 9 , FMS is always 100% over Co17Zn/NC600 and furfural was completely converted either with raising reaction temperature to 140 °C for 2 h or with prolonging reaction time to 2.5 h at 125 °C. Then prolong reaction time, furfural could be completely hydrogenated, while FMS decreases either with raising reaction temperature or with prolonging reaction time over Co/NC600. 3.5 Leaching experiment and reusability of Co17Zn/NC600 for FH After FH over Co17Zn/NC600 for 1 h, Co17Zn/NC600 was leached and then the reaction mixture was heated for another 1.5 h. As Fig. S6 shows, furfural was not hydrogenated after removing Co17Zn/NC600, further proving that Co17Zn/NC600 plays a crucial role in FH under pressurized H2. As Fig. 10 depicts, FC almost does not change and FM is the only product over recycled Co17Zn/NC600. Correspondingly, the main structure of Co17Zn/NC600 does not change significantly before and after recycling, indicating that Co17Zn/NC600 has good recycling performance (Fig. S7). 3.6 Reaction mechanism for FH over Co/NC600 and Co17Zn/NC600 As compared in Fig. 11 , the mechanisms for FH in ethanol between Co17Zn/NC600 and Co/NC600 are quite different. On Co/NC600, H2 is captured and activated to relatively mobile H+ and immobile H− adsorbed on NPsCo. The 2 oxygen atoms (OAs) in furfural were captured via NPsCo packaged in carbon skeleton. Then the OA in −HC=O in furfural is more easily attacked by H+ to form −HC+−OH followed by abstracting H− from the surface of NPsCo to form −CH2OH, i.e., furfural was hydrogenated to FM. On the other hand, H2 can also be activated to H…H, which adds to the furan ring in FM leads to the formation of THFM. The subsequent ROR could be induced by H+ attack on the OA in the tetrahydrofuran ring in THFM. Over Co17Zn/NC600, H2 is only activated to relatively movable H+ and immovable H− adsorbed on Co3ZnC NPs rather than to H…H so that the hydrogenation of the furan ring in FM cannot proceed. Co17Zn/NC600 catalyzes FH to FM more selectively than other reported catalysts (Table S3) and can selectively catalyze the hydrogenation of many other aldehydes (Table 1 ). 4 Conclusions Co17Zn/NC600 prepared by calcining Co17/ZIF-8 remains stable flower-spherical structure formed via reaction of Co2+ with ZIF-8 with highly dispersed NPsCo3ZnC. Over Co17Zn/NC600, furfural can be completely hydrogenated to FM at 125 °C for 2.5 h. There is almost no change in FC over repeatedly recycled Co17Zn/NC600. However, over Co/NC600, although furfural is also completely converted, FMS is only 70.6% at 125 °C for 2.5 h. These results indicate that Co17Zn/NC600 is highly active and stable for repeated use.

        "dc:description": "Co–Zn/NC was prepared by a sacrificial template self-reduction method with zeolitic imidazolate frame-8 (ZIF-8) impregnating the Co2+ as the precursor. At 125 °C for 2.5 h, furfural was completely converted to furan-2-ylmethanol (FM) over Co17Zn/NC600, while FM selectivity over Co/NC600 is only 70.6%. According to multiple characterizations, Co17Zn/NC600 (Co loading 17%, calcined at 600 °C) consists of flower-like spherical Co3ZnC nanoparticles (NPsCo3ZnC) uniformly distributed on its surface. The NPsCo3ZnC are the main active ingredients for highly selective furfural hydrogenation to FM, which is confirmed by furfural hydrogenation over Co–Zn/NC prepared with different Co loadings and different calcination temperatures. The excellent activity and stability of Co17Zn/NC600 were confirmed by recycling experiment and furfural conversion is still above 90% after repeated use of Co17Zn/NC600 for 8 cycles.",
