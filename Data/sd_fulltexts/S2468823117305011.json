Graphical abstract The Fe nanoparticles embedded by graphitized carbon were conveniently prepared. The resulting materials, with high surface area and porosity, well dispersed iron nanoparticles (NPs) associated with graphitized carbon structure, show high activity and durability in ammonia decomposition reaction. The Fe nanoparticles embedded by graphitized carbon were developed through a strategy of hydrothermal and thermal treatment. The resulting materials, with high surface area and porosity, well dispersed iron nanoparticles (NPs) associated with graphitized carbon structure, show high activity and durability in ammonia decomposition reaction. Among the serial Fe-based catalysts, Fe@GC-4 of a low iron content (1.29wt%) exhibits significant ammonia decomposition activity (∼71% conversion and 22.1molH2 gFe −1 h−1) at a gas hourly space velocity of 6000cm3gcat −1 h−1 and 600°C. After an extended period of reaction conducted over the representative Fe@GC-3 catalyst, most of the embedded Fe NPs transform to nitride species with relatively smaller particle size, while the embedded structure still retains. This study provides new insights into the development of cheap metal-based catalysts functionalized by graphitized carbon (graphene) for the current reaction and other potential applications. Keywords Embedded structure Iron nanoparticles Graphitized carbon Ammonia decomposition Hydrogen source 1 Introduction Hydrogen is considered one of the most important clean energy carriers for future energy systems [1]. The implementation of sustainable hydrogen production and subsequent hydrogen conversion to energy is called “hydrogen economy”. Unfortunately, its physical properties make the transport and handling of hydrogen gas difficult [2]. Liquid ammonia, as a hydrogen-rich molecule, can be easily stored, transported and converted to COx-free hydrogen for the demand of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Therefore, on-site generation of hydrogen via NH3 catalytic decomposition has attracted extensive attention for easy handling and relatively low cost [3–6]. In the past few decades, most efforts have been devoted to Ru-, Ni-, Fe- and Co-based catalysts [3–6]. Among them, carbon supported catalysts showed advance performance for NH3 decomposition, which was thought to be the electronic promotion effect of carbon support on active metal species, facilitating the recombinative desorption of surface nitrogen atoms [7–10]. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) supported Ru catalyst was found to be the most active catalyst known to date [7]. Zhang et al. [11,12] adopted CNTs containing residual Co, Fe or their alloy nanoparticles as catalysts for NH3 decomposition, achieving superior activity and structural maintenance during the reaction. Other types of carbon materials, such as carbon nanofibers (CNFs), ordered nanostructured carbons (CMK-5) and graphitized carbon, were also employed as supports in ammonia decomposition [13–17]. In recent years, the unique properties have been observed by confining/embedding metal NPs into inorganic channels or cavities, which offer new opportunities to design advanced catalytic systems [18,19]. How to introduce catalytic active species (such as metal or metal oxide NPs) dispersed homogeneously in graphitized carbon matrix remains challenging. Several works have shown that functional nanoparticles encapsulated into ordered mesoporous carbons can be synthesized through either a hard-templating approach using ordered mesoporous silica as a template [10,20–22] or a soft-templating approach based on co-assembly of triblockcopolymers pluronic F127 and resol or resorcinol-formaldehyde in the presence of metal salts [23–25]. However, these methods require the preparation of ordered mesoporous silica or low-polymerized phenolic resol as the scaffold, which certainly increases technical complexity as well as cost of catalyst fabrication. Yu and co-workers designed a one-pot hydrothermal cohydrolysis-carbonization process using glucose and metal nitrate as starting materials, and succeeded in fabrication of uniformly embedded iron oxide NPs in carbonaceous spheres [26]. Despite it showed remarkable stability and selectivity in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, high graphitization degree as well as porosity of carbon matrix is a prerequisite for many catalytic reactions. Bao’s group recently reported that graphitized carbon could open up a route to enhance catalytic performance by coating of metal catalysts with controlled graphitized covers [27,28]. Deposition of graphitized carbon over metal oxides was also employed to improve high stability of electrocatalyst [29,30]. In this study, metal iron nanocatalysts encapsulated by graphitized carbon were synthesized via successive hydrothermal and calcination procedures, and applied for COx-free hydrogen production via ammonia decomposition. The aim of catalyst design is to construct a type of “embedded active phase” that is cheap metal-based and nanostructured. Due to the interaction between metal and graphitized carbon, the mesoporous Fe@GC composites with the unique nano-architecture could be efficient for ammonia decomposition, exhibiting notably low-temperature activity for the Fe-based catalyst, and high resistance against methanation by highly graphitized carbon networks. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalysts preparation Embedded iron nanoparticles by graphitized carbon catalysts were prepared by a facile modified hydrothermal method [26] and subsequent thermal treatment. Typical synthesis procedure of Fe@GC composites as follows: glucose (0.1mol) and Fe(NO3)3•9H2O (0.01mol) were dissolved into deionized water solution (30mL) under stirring in sequence. After stirring for 0.5h, the solution mixture was transferred into a 50mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 120°C for 24h. The resulting products were collected from the autoclave, centrifuged and washed with deionized water and ethanol for three times, and finally dried at 70°C for 24h. Then the resultant powder was calcined by heating it up to 700°C at a temperature ramp of 4°Cmin−1 under N2 atmosphere and maintained for 4h to get Fe@GC composites. A series of Fe@GC composites with different iron contents were realized by changing the amount of iron precursor salts. The corresponding samples were denoted as Fe@GC-1, Fe@GC-2, Fe@GC-3 and Fe@GC-4 composites, respectively. 2.2 Catalyst characterization N2 adsorption analysis was performed at 77K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 to access the surface areas and pore size distributions. All the samples were outgassed at 200°C for 6h. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Philips X’Pert MPD Pro X-ray diffractometer with graphite-monochromatized Cu Kα radiation at a scanning rate of 2°/min in the 2θ range from 20° to 80°. TEM images were taken over a JEOL JEM-2000EX instrument operated at 200kV. The SEM images were taken on a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope to determine the catalyst morphology and microstructure. XPS data were obtained with an ESCALab220i-XL electron spectrometer from VG Scientific using 300W Al-K radiations. The base pressure was approximately 3×10−9 mbar. The binding energies were referenced to the C1s line at 284.8eV from adventitious carbon. The Raman spectra were collected on a Raman spectrometer (JY, HR 800) using a 514nm laser. The metal loadings on porous carbon were determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, PE OPTIMA 2100DV). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was simultaneously performed on a DTG-60 instrument (Shimadzu, Japan) at a heating rate of 10°C/min under N2 atmospheres. 2.3 Catalyst activity For the ammonia decomposition reaction, the dried power catalysts (Fe@GC, 25mg) were placed on a frit in the quartz tube, fixed-bed reactor with an internal diameter of 6mm. The temperature-dependent conversion measurements of NH3 were carried out as follows. Firstly, the temperature was raised to 600°C in a pure ammonia stream and kept for 2h, corresponding to a space velocity of 6000cm3 gcat −1 h−1. After cooling down in the ammonia stream to 400°C, the evaluated activity was started. Then the next target temperature was raised with a heating rate of 5°Cmin−1 up to 600°C. For each temperature, four values were recorded within 1h under steady-state conditions using a GC-9860. The ammonia conversion was detected by GC equipped with a thermal conductive detector (TCD) and a 3m Poropak Q packed column and using He as carrier gas. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural characterization The embedded structure feature of Fe@GC is successfully achieved via hydrothermal followed calcination treatment. The iron contents in the serial Fe@GC catalyst were finely tuned by changing the addition of iron precursors during the hydrothermal process. And the iron contents determined by ICP-AES technique varied from 56.05wt% to 1.29wt% (Table 1 ). In order to further understand the carbonization process, the pristine representative Fe@GC-3 was investigated by TGA technique. In Fig. 1 A, the carbonization/gasification of as-synthesized Fe-embedded carbonaceous spheres in a nitrogen flow was studied in the 60–900°C temperature range. It can be seen that there exhibits a weight loss of around 52% up to 900°C. The weight loss below 200°C is generally attributed to evaporation of water, while the organic species/carbon can be lost or burned off at higher temperature. Noticeably, a slight weight loss occurs at around 600°C, which might be ascribed to the auto-reduction of iron species [31]. The graphitized structure of Fe@GC-3 was further characterized by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 1B). The peaks at 1346 and 1580cm−1 correspond to the D (disordered carbon) and G (graphitized carbon) bands, respectively. It has been reported that the intensity ratio of D and G bands (ID/IG) is related to the orderliness of the graphite structure [13]. The ID/IG values of the carbon materials are all larger than 0.5, indicating the amorphous carbon structure with a high content of lattice edges or defects in plane terminations of disordered graphite of carbon materials [32]. In comparison with pure carbon without Fe calcined at 700°C (ID/IG =1.20), the pristine Fe@GC-3 sample calcined at 700°C shows the corresponding ID/IG value of 1.04, indicating enhanced formation of graphitized carbon with the aid of iron catalyst [33]. It is thus clear that the Fe@GC-3 sample has a certain graphitic degree, also in accordance with the XRD and HRTEM results. A higher graphitic degree makes electron transfer easier between the support and the metal particles, thus resulting an enhancement of catalytic activity. Fig. 2 shows the microstructure of the representative fresh and used Fe@GC-3 catalysts. For the fresh Fe@GC-3, the Fe NPs are entirely embedded in the carbon matrix (Fig. 2a). Part of particles were coated with a thin carbon layer, exhibiting a form of core-shell structure. Typical core-shell structures of the Fe-C were also found in the Fe-CNFs/mica catalyst, which were attributed to the reversible dissolution and precipitation of carbon phase following temperature change [15]. The mean particle size of Fe NPs is 12.7nm (Fig. 2b), with a relatively wide size distribution. Seen from HRTEM image (Fig. 2e), the lattice fringes of metallic Fe was 0.202nm. The distance between the lattice fringes of the shell was 0.340nm, corresponding to the distance between the (002) planes of graphitized carbon. Noticeably, the used catalyst subjected to a reaction running at 600°C for 20h displayed smaller particle size of Fe NPs (9.5nm, Fig. 2c and d). It is speculated that the metallic Fe NPs might undergo reconstruction during the reaction, whereas some of Fe-containing species (a small fraction of nitride) were still embedded in the carbon matrix. In view of Fig. 2f, the crystal lattice fringes of Fe2N could also be identified. Theoretical calculations and experimental investigations confirmed that the N atoms tend to occupy subsurface sites, leading to the formation of nitride under an NH3 atmosphere [10,34–36]. The XRD patterns of fresh and used Fe@GC-3 are illustrated in Fig. 3 . The presence of graphitized carbon (2θ=26°) is confirmed, consistent with the HRTEM observation (Fig. 2). Note that the diffraction peaks of iron species show complex patterns. The peaks at 2θ=44.6° and 65.0° correspond to crystalline facets of Fe (110) and Fe (200) planes (JCPDS 01-089-7194). Based on the reflection peak at 2θ=44.6°, the mean crystallite size of Fe NPs in the fresh sample is calculated to be ca. 23.8nm according to Scherrer's equation. Unfortunately, the particles sizes determined from XRD and TEM results show obvious difference. We attribute it to the aggregation/sintering of Fe species during carbonization process. Due to complex reactions at high thermal temperature, the carbon matrix is easily destroyed. And it is unavoidable that Fe species detached from carbon matrix. In addition, the diffraction peaks of Fe3C (121), (211), and (102) (JCPDS 03-065-2412) are also detected at 2θ=37.6°, 42.8°, and 43.7° for the fresh Fe@GC-3 sample. It suggests that Fe species are essentially reduced and carburized after thermal treatment at 700°C in N2 flow. Similar phenomenon was also observed over CNTs encapsulated iron catalyst [31]. During the heating process, iron species are easily reduced and carburized, forming iron carbides. Different crystalline phases were identified in the used catalyst. After reaction at 600°C for 20h, the diffraction peaks of metallic Fe disappeared, whereas other crystalline phases including FeN (JCPDS01-088-2153) and Fe2N (JCPDS01-073-2102) can be observed. Among these iron-containing species, Fe2N is also observed from the HRTEM image. The XPS analyses reveal that, the Fe2N species exist on catalyst surface after reaction, although the characteristic peak is weak. N2 sorption isotherms and pore size distributions of different Fe@GC catalysts are presented in Fig. 4 , showing a combination of types I and IV physisorption isotherms. As can be seen from Fig. 4A, the nitrogen uptake rises noticeably at low relative pressures (<0.1), indicating the existence of a certain number of micropores in these samples. A distinct H2 hysteresis loops is observed at relative pressures of 0.4–0.8, characteristic for mesoporous material. The corresponding of pore size distribution curves are illustrated in Fig. 4B. An uniform mesopores centered at around 3.0nm are observed for the serial Fe@GC catalysts. The calculated BET surface areas, pore volumes, and pore sizes are shown in Table 1. This series of samples is characterized by high surface areas (274.8–447.4m2g−1), large volumes (0.22–0.28cm3g−1), and uniform pore sizes (2.0–3.5nm). It can be observed that the BET surface area and micropore volume increase with decreasing Fe content. The auto-reduction of metal oxides embedded in carbon matrix has a significant influence on the texture of carbon matrix. In addition, the surface area and porosity of the used Fe@GC-3# catalyst were also characterized by BET technique. It can be seen that the micro/mesoporous characteristic of the used catalyst exhibits tiny difference in comparison with the fresh catalyst. The surface area of the used Fe@GC-3# catalyst is 370.6m2 g−1, which changes a little. Note that the porosity increases obviously, and the average pore size increases from 3.1nm up to 3.7nm. It suggests that the structural change took place during reaction process, generating more developed porosity. XPS characterization was employed to clarify the chemical state of iron species in the fresh and used Fe@GC-3. The spectra of Fe@GC-3 shown in Fig. 5 A suggests co-existence of C, O and Fe on catalyst surface. The C 1s peak centered at 284.8eV was used as a reference. Compared with the used catalyst, the fresh sample shows almost no signal (ca. 400eV) attributed to N species. A weak Fe peak is also observed in the survey spectrum. In comparison with the bulk Fe contents (9.56wt%), the atomic ratio of Fe determined by XPS are 0.75% and 1.09% for the fresh and used catalyst respectively (Table 2 ). It demonstrates that a large quantity of iron species are encapsulated within the graphitized carbon [10,31]. In the fresh catalyst, the peaks at 707.1 and 720.2eV are characteristic for metallic Fe (Fig. 5B). The peaks in the range of 708.0–718.0eV can be assigned to the Fe(II) and Fe (III) species [37]. As for fresh catalyst, obvious metallic Fe peaks are observed besides the Fe(II) and Fe (III) peaks. Whereas Fe mainly exists in the form of Fex+ (x=2-3) in the used catalyst. Predictably the combination of Fe and O is separated in reaction process accompany with high hydrogen concentration. The observed oxidized Fe species for fresh and used catalysts should be attributed to air oxidation of sample prior to XPS measurement, or other forms of Fe species (such as, FexC, FexN). 3.2 Catalytic performance The activity of various catalysts for NH3 decomposition is shown in Fig. 6 A. All the catalysts exhibit enhanced ammonia conversion at elevated reaction temperature. The activity over the serial Fe@GC catalysts increase with increasing Fe content, except Fe@GC-3. Approximately 80% NH3 conversion was achieved at 600°C and GHSV=6000cm3 gcat −1 h−1 over Fe@GC-3. Notably, Fe@GC-4 catalyst with the lowest Fe content (1.29wt%) gives around 71% NH3 conversion at 600°C. To the best of our knowledge, these results are slightly lower than the highest values reported on the Fe-based catalyst [10]. In their study, catalyst C-Fe-1.17-400 (5.2wt% Fe) nearly completely decomposes ammonia at 600°C and 7500cm3 gcat −1 h−1. However, compared with the reported advance Fe/CNFs (3.5wt%) [15] and Fe-containing CNTs (2.8wt%) [11] catalysts, our prepared Fe@GC catalysts show superior catalytic activity. The former showed 51.3% ammonia conversion at 600°C and GHSV=6500cm3 gcat −1 h−1 [15], and the latter showed ∼75.1% ammonia conversion at 700°C and GHSV=5000cm3 gcat −1 h−1 [11]. In addition, the corresponding H2 formation rate over per unit mass of iron are presented in Fig. 6B. Among these catalysts, Fe@GC-4 catalyst exhibits the highest H2 formation rate (e.g., 22.1mol gFe −1 h−1 at 600°C). It is well known that both cleavage of NH bond and recombinative desorption of surface nitrogen atoms might be the rate-limiting steps in ammonia decomposition [38]. Previous studies indicated that a higher graphitization degree would result in enhanced electron conductivity of carbon support, which would efficiently transfer electrons from support to Fe and promote recombinative desorption of surface nitrogen atoms as the most abundant reaction intermediate [13,17,39,40]. In the current study, the prepared catalysts showed certain degree of graphitization, which is thought to be favorable for activity enhancement. Besides, the texture and porosity of carbon matrix should be another factor to influence catalytic activity. Developed porosities are achieved for the fresh and used catalyst, which are confirmed by BET results. High porosity ensures better accessibility of the embedded metal to NH3 molecules. On the basis of XRD and XPS results, it can be concluded that the Fe components of used Fe@GC-3 are mainly in the form of metallic Fe and FexN. Zhang et al. [11] suggested that FeNx was the primary active species in the Fe containing CNTs for ammonia decomposition. In light of XRD and TPD measurements, Ohtsuka et al. [41] proposed that the Fe catalyst promoted NH3 decomposition through cyclic mechanism involving the formation of N-containing intermediate species and the subsequent decomposition to N2 (>700°C). This was also confirmed by Lu and coworker [34]. Metallic Fe was the prevailing phase in ammonia decomposition >650°C. Meanwhile, FeNx species as stable crystalline phases also contributed to NH3 conversion. In this study, Fe and FexC species are main crystalline phases in fresh catalyst confirmed by XRD analysis. It was reported that metallic Fe or Fe carbide, have some activity for this reaction, but are probably not the most active phase [11]. Note that FexN species as main crystalline phases were detected in the used catalyst. It seems plausible to attribute the increased activity to the formation the nitride phase. Although iron nitride has been proposed to play a vital role in NH3 decomposition, there is still lack of direct observation as the proof. The real active phases of Fe-based catalyst for ammonia decomposition needs further study. Fig. 7 presents the catalytic activity measured at 600°C as a function of GHSV and catalyst stability test for Fe@GC-3. Catalyst Fe@GC-3 gives ∼80% NH3 conversion at 600°C and GHSV=6000cm3gcat −1 h−1. Further increase in GHSV to 36,000cm3gcat −1 h−1 results in a decrease in conversion (56%). Durability test was performed on Fe@GC-3 at 600°C and GHSV=15,000cm3gcat −1 h−1. NH3 conversion remains constant at around 65% within 20h. Owing to spatial restriction, the Fe particles are almost completely embedded inside graphitized carbon matrix (Fig. 2c), and such structural isolation enhances stability of Fe NPs. 4 Conclusions The Fe metal catalysts embedded in graphitized carbon were developed through simple hydrothermal and thermal treatments. These catalysts were applied for ammonia decomposition and showed excellent activity as well as promising stability. The Fe content in Fe@GC showed notable impact on NH3 conversion, and even with a significantly low Fe content (1.29wt%), considerable NH3 conversion (71%) can be achieved at a far low reaction temperature (600°C) for Fe-based catalyst. The current study could be informative for rational design of other embedded metal or metal oxide in porous graphitized carbon for other potential applications.
