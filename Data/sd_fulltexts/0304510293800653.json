(+81-827)224111, fax. (+81-827)538811 Abstract The effect of bis-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (BEHP) and phenyl triethoxy silane (PES) as donors on the stereospecificity of propylene polymerization catalysis was investigated using a MgC12supported TiCl, catalyst. It is suggested that BEHP plays an important role in the fixation of PES on the MgCl2-supported TiC14 catalyst, and the fixed PES acts as an effective stereospecificity improver. Key words: bis-2-ethylhexylphthalate; electron donor; magnesium chloride support; phenyl triethoxy silane; propylene polymerization; stereospecific catalysis; titanium tetrachloride Introduction It is well known that a M902-supported TiC14 catalyst in combination with an electron donor such as ethyl benzoate exhibits a high activity and a high stereospeciiicity [ 1-3 ] . The use of phthalate and alkoxy silane compounds as an internal and an external donor, respectively, instead of ethylbenzoate, further enhances the activity and the stereospecificity of the catalyst [ 4,5 ] . In fact, these donors are most important key factors in determining the performance of the catalyst in stereospecific polymerization, and there is a great deal of interest in the role of donors, especially phthalate and alkoxy silane, in this field [ 6-8 ] . In this paper, in order to gain an insight into the role of phthalate and alkoxy silane in stereospecific MgC14-supported TiC14 catalysis, we used two types of catalyst (MgC12/TiC14/BEHP, M9C12/TiC14), treating each catalyst with PES and/or Et3Al in the absence of monomer, followed by propylene polymerization with the treated catalyst.

Catal. 82 (1993)11-16 Experimental Preparation of catalyst (solid catalyst) Two types of MgCl2-supported TiC14 catalyst were prepared: one is the catalyst containing bis-2-ethylhexyl phthalate as an internal donor (MgC12/ TiC14/BEHP), the other is the catalyst containing no donor (MgC12/TiCl,). The catalysts were prepared as follows. In a 800 ml stainless steel pot containing 2.8 kg of stainless steel balls (15 mm diameter), 20 g of M9C12 was milled, either with or without 12.4 ml of BEHP for 8 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The milled MgC12 was treated with 200 ml of TiC14 at 80 C for 2 h. Subsequently, the solid product was separated by filtration and washed twice with hexane. Treatment of catalyst components The catalyst (0.5 mmol in terms of Ti) was treated with PES (PES/Ti=02.0 molar ratio) in the presence of 5 mmol of Et3A1 in 100 ml of hexane at 20 C for 1 h. After the reaction, the solid part of the catalyst was separated by filtration and washed twice with hexane. Catalyst analysis The Ti and Mg contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectorophotometry. The BEHP and PES contents were measured by gas chromatography. Polymerization of propylene In a 11 glass autoclave equipped with a stirrer, 500 ml of decane was added and the system was charged with propylene. 2.5 mmol of Et3A1 and 0.05 mmol of MgC12-supported catalyst (in terms of Ti) were added, in the order stated, at 70 C. Polymerization was carried out under atmospheric pressure at 70 C for 1 h. Propylene was supplied continuously in order to maintain atmospheric pressure. After 1 h, a small amount of isobutanol was added to the autoclave to arrest polymerization, and then the whole product was poured into a large amount of methanol. The resulting polymer was filtered and vacuum dried at 800C for 12 h. Results and discussion MgCl2/TiCl4/BEHP catalyst The catalyst containing BEHP (MgC12/TiCl4/BEHP catalyst) was treated with PES (PES/Ti=0-2.0 molar ratio) in the presence of Et3A1 in hexane. The treated catalyst was then recovered by filtration, followed by the analysis of the catalyst components. The analytical data are listed in Table 1.

When the catalyst was treated in the absence of PES, ca. 40% of the Ti component and ca. 75% of the BEHP were released from the catalyst (run No. 3 ). With the introduction of PES into the treatment system, a further release 14 1.0 o E E Y i; 0-5 .' 0.0 M. Kioka and N. Kashiwa/J. Mol. Catal. 82 (1993)11-16 0.0 1.0 PES/Mg x 10~ (molar ratio) Fig. 2.

Isotactic index of polypropylene produced by treated catalyst. of Ti and BEHP from the catalyst were observed ( run Nos. 4-6 ) . On the other hand, part of PES introduced was filed on the MgC12-supported TiC14 catalyst. Propylene polymerization was performed with the catalyst treated as described above in combination with Et3A1 at 70 C for 1 h. The resulting polymer was fractionated into soluble ( ata-PP ) and insoluble ( iso-PP ) portions using boiling heptane. The results are shown in Table 1. The following observations can be pointed out from these data. Both the activity for iso-PP and ata-PP (in terms of Ti) were increased M. Kioka and N. Kashiwa/J Mol. Catal. 82 (1993) I1-16 15 by treating the catalyst with Et3Al only (run No. 3). This is probably due to the release of a complex of Ti and BEHP which is inactive in propylene polymerization. As the amount of PES incorporated into the catalyst increased, the activity for iso-PP increased, while that for ata-PP decreased, resulting in a remarkable enhancement of the isotactic index (II), represented by the weight fraction of polymer which is insoluble in boiling heptane. In particular, the treated catalyst having a 10/2/1 molar ratio of Et3Al/ PES/Ti provides a 91.1% II without PES as an external donor (run No. 6), which corresponds to the II obtained by adding PES in the polymerization stage (run no. 2) . MgCl2/TiCl4 catalyst Next, the catalyst containing no internal donor (MgC12/TiCl, catalyst) was also treated with PES and Et3A1 in the same manner as for the MgCl2/ TiCl4/BEHP catalyst. Unlike the MgC12/TiCI4/BEHP catalyst, only a small amount of PES was incorporated into the solid catalyst, despite the fact that same amount of PES was introduced into the reaction system (run Nos. 6, 9). This implies that BEHP plays an important role in incorporating PES into the catalyst. A replacement reaction between BEHP and PES probably occurs on the catalyst surface. Furthermore, the way Ti is released from the MgC12/TiCl,, catalyst is different from MgC12/TiC14/BEHP catalyst; i.e., when contacted with only E,331, the Ti content remained unchanged for the former catalyst, while it was remarkably decreased for the latter one (ca. 40% ) (run Nos. 3, 8). A plausible reason for this difference may be that the complex of Ti with BEHP is weakly deposited on the catalyst, and is easily released from the catalyst by the interaction with Et3A1. Polymerization was carried out using the treated MgC12/TiCl,, catalyst. The treatment with Et3A1 in the absence of PES results in a decrease of the activity, while the value of II remains unchanged. With the introduction of PES into this catalyst system, the II values were increased, but not by much (ca. 66% ), because only a small amount of PES was incorporated into the catalyst. Comparing the MgC12/TiCI4/BEHP with the MgC12/TiCI4 catalyst system in terms of the effect of PES on stereospecificity, it can be said that BEHP plays an important role in that it allows PES to act as an effective stereospecificity improver.
