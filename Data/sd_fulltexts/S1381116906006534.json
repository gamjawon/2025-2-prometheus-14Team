Keywords Diastereoselectivity Ring-closing metathesis Catalyst 1 Introduction In the past two decades the ring-closing metathesis (RCM) reaction of alkenes has evolved to become a major tool for synthetic organic chemists and has successfully been applied to the synthesis of heterocyclic, carbocyclic and macrocyclic molecules [1]. Additionally, the use of multiple or cascade RCM reactions can be exploited to provide various bicyclic systems [2–5] from acyclic precursors in a single step. We recently used this strategy in an efficient synthesis of the NK1 receptor antagonist (1), in which the key step is the diastereoselective double RCM reaction of tetraene (2), to afford (3a) as the major product in 70% ds (Scheme 1 ) [6]. Although this synthesis offered significant advantages over other routes to the target [7] the modest selectivity in the key step lowered the overall yield and we sought a method to improve this transformation. Extensive mechanistic studies had indicated that the reaction proceeded via the intermediacy of four monocyclic intermediates (4a), (4b), (5a) and (5b) (Fig. 1 ). The relative ratio of these intermediates was shown to be catalyst dependant, as was their subsequent conversions to spirocycles [8]. As such, the use of different catalysts led to differing stereochemical outcomes, with first generation type catalysts such as the recently published (6) [9] giving 68% selectivity for the desired product (3a), whereas second generation type catalysts such as (7) [10] gave a near non-selective reaction, with a small preference for (3b). With all catalysts tested to date [11], the major pathway for reaction of (2) is the initial formation of an equimolar mixture of the two five membered rings (4a) and (4b)—path A (Scheme 2 ), and subsequent reaction of these isolated compounds gave a mixture of spirocycles resulting from some inversion at the quaternary centre. The minor pathway leading to the formation of the six membered rings—path B, gave high selectivity for the formation of (5a) over (5b) when using (6), but a near 1:1 mixture when using (7). Clean conversion of (5a) and (5b) to (3a) and (3b), respectively was observed with all catalysts. Based on these observations it was proposed that if a method were available to direct the reaction through path B, a more selective outcome might be obtained. In this paper we describe the scope and limitations of such an approach to achieve an improved selectivity for the formation of (3a). 2 Experimental 2.1 General Melting points were measured on a Bibby SMP3 melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer 341 polarimeter at the sodium D-line. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker DRX400 instrument using an internal deuterium lock at ambient probe temperature. Mass spectrometry was performed on a Hewlett Packard Series 1100 MSD. Accurate mass determinations were run on a Waters/Micromass LCT Time of Flight mass spectrometer using positive ion electrospray ionisation. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis were performed on an Agilent 1100 series machine with a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8 4.6mm×250mm column with acetonitrile and 0.1% H3PO4 as eluant. Reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere unless otherwise stated. Chemicals and solvents were obtained from commercial sources and were used as received. The term brine refers to a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride. Thin layer chromatography was performed on Merck KGaA silica gel 60F254 glass precoated plates (250μm thickness) and visualized by shortwave light or anisaldehyde dip. Catalyst (6) was purchased from Strem Chemical company and catalyst (7) from Aldrich Chemical company. The synthesis and characterisation of compounds (2), (3a), (3b), (4a), (4b), (5a), (5b), (12) and (16) have been reported previously [6,8]. Crotyl bromide was purchased as a 85:15 trans:cis ratio, and these isomers were inseparable in compounds (8), (10a) and (10b) which are characterised by 1H NMR and LCMS only. 2.2 Preparation of tertiary alcohol (14) 2.2.1 N-Allyl-[(1S)-2-hydroxy-1-phenyl-2-vinylbut-3-en-1-yl]-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide (14) To a solution of methyl ester (12) (1.91g, 5.99mmol) in acetonitrile (40.0mL) at room temperature was added K2CO3 (1.65g, 12.0mmol) followed by allyl bromide (1.0mL, 12.0mmol). The mixture was warmed to 40°C and stirred for 16h at which stage HPLC analysis indicated >95% conversion. The solids were removed by filtration and acetonitrile removed under vacuum. The resulting oil was partitioned between ethyl acetate (40mL) and water (40mL) and the organic layer concentrated to give (13), which was used without further purification in the next reaction. Anhydrous cerium chloride (7.38g, 29.9mmol) was heated to 150°C under high vacuum with stirring for 2h and then cooled under a stream of nitrogen. THF (50mL) was added at room temperature and the slurry stirred overnight. A solution of the crude methyl ester (13) in THF (10mL) was added and the slurry cooled to 0°C and vinylmagnesium bromide (20.0mL, 1.0M in THF, 20.0mmol) added. After 1h the reaction was quenched by addition of aqueous citric acid (50mL, 1.0M) and extracted with MeOtBu (50mL). The organic layer was washed with brine (50mL) and concentrated in vacuo. The crude oil was purified by flash column chromatography (10:90 EtOAc:hexanes increasing to 30:70 EtOAc:hexanes) to afford the tertiary alcohol (14) as a viscous oil, 982mg, 43% over two steps.

In the case of catalyst (6) a further 5mol% was added to allow the reaction to reach completion. The relative ratios of intermediates and product are given in Scheme 7, the products were not isolated. 2.6.2 RCM of (9) To a stirred, cooled (0°C) solution of (9) (12.2mg, 0.027mmol) in CH2Cl2 (1.0mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere was added catalyst (6) (0.9mg, 0.0014mmol, 5mol%) and the progress of the reaction monitored by HPLC. When all starting material had been consumed most of the solvent was removed by nitrogen sweep and the reaction cooled to −78°C. Butene was condensed into the flask (ca. 0.5mL), catalyst (7) (1.2mg, 5mol%) added, and the reaction stirred at 3°C for 24h, a further 1.2mg of catalyst (7) was added and stirring continued for an additional 24h at the same temperature. At this time 95% conversion of intermediates to a 84:16 mixture of (3a):(3b) was observed by HPLC analysis. The known products were not isolated. 3 Results and discussion We propose that the rate determining step for the formation of the mono-cyclic intermediates is the intermolecular reaction of the catalyst with one of the allyl groups, with the subsequent intramolecular cyclisation being fast [12]. As such the preponderance of path A is due to a non-obvious preference for the catalyst to react at the oxygen bound allyl group, rather than a kinetic preference for the formation of five membered rings per se, and hence it might be possible to overcome this preference by catalyst or substrate design. As a thorough catalyst screen had already been undertaken attention turned to substrate design. Derivatives of (2) in which initial catalyst interaction at the oxygen-allyl group was rendered unfavorable, for example, by incorporation of a blocking group in this position, should direct initiation to the next most accessible position, i.e. the nitrogen-allyl group and the reaction would proceed through path B (Scheme 3 ). For this strategy to be effective three criteria must be met; firstly, the reaction could be directed through initial formation of the six membered rings; secondly, high selectivity for the desired six membered ring would still be obtained with these modified substrates; thirdly, these new six membered rings would cyclise with retention of stereochemistry. The O-crotyl (8) and O-isopentyl (9) derivatives of (2) were considered as suitable substrates to test this hypothesis. Prior to undertaking the synthesis and double ring closing metathesis reaction of these substrates genuine samples of the putative new intermediates (10a), (10b), (11a), (11b) were prepared. In addition to aiding reaction analysis [13] this would allow for development of conditions to effect conversion of the proposed intermediates to (3a) or (3b) with retention of stereochemistry. These compounds were prepared in a straightforward manner as outlined in Scheme 4 . Hence, allylation of the N-tosyl methyl ester (12) with allyl bromide and potassium carbonate in acetonitrile afforded the crude N-allyl amino ester (13). This was converted without further purification to the tertiary alcohol (14) in modest yield. The previously described non-selective RCM reaction [8] of this triene was used to advantage to afford samples of both (15a) and (15b) which were separable by chromatography and subsequent reaction of the alcohols with crotyl bromide or 4-bromo-2-metyl-2-butene in the presence of sodium hydride afforded the expected intermediates (10) and (11) for the proposed double RCM reaction. With compounds (10) and (11) in hand their conversion to (3) was addressed (Scheme 5 ). Gratifyingly, treatment of (10a) with either catalyst (6) or (7) gave exclusively (3a), and likewise (3b) was formed as the only product from (10b), indicating direct cyclisation with retention of stereochemistry is the only mechanistic pathway operating in this reaction, and mirroring the reactions seen in the allyl series [8]. The more sterically hindered (11a) and (11b) did not react with either catalyst under a nitrogen atmosphere, however after activation with ethylene, catalyst (7) allowed for 50% conversion of (11a) to (3a) and (11b) to (3b) [14]. More encouragingly, carrying out this transformation in butene as solvent gave full conversion of either (11a) or (11b) to a single spirocycle. This reaction proceeded via the intermediacy of the crotyl species (10a or 10b) resulting from an initial cross metathesis reaction with the solvent [15] and offers an efficient “in situ” method for activation of the hindered isopentenyl group. Neither the ethylene or butene activation proceedure was sufficient to allow catalyst (6) to be used with (11). Based on these results, formation of spirocyclic compounds from (10) or (11) is expected to proceed with retention of stereochemistry, but in the case of (11) a second generation catalyst and additional activation will be required. With confirmation that any six membered ring intermediates would cyclise with retention of stereochemistry, attention turned to preparation of the desired tetraenes (Scheme 6 ). Alcohol (14) could be converted to (8) or (9), however yields in these reactions were low, possibly due to competing reactions of the oxygen anion. A more efficient route to generate useful amounts of material was found to be sequential alkylations of alcohol (16) – an intermediate in the original route to (1). Hence, alcohol (16) was treated with sodium hydride, followed by 1equiv. of 4-bromo-2-methyl-2-butene, which gave preferential reaction at the oxygen anion to afford (17) in modest yield. Triene (17) was then converted to (9) in a straightforward manner. Although yields for the formation of (8) and (9) were less than optimum sufficient material was obtained to study the double RCM reaction. Treatment of a dichloromethane solution of (8) with catalyst (6) gave >95% conversion to a 77:23 ratio of (3a):(3b) after 16h (Scheme 7 ). While this represents an improved selectivity compared to the original substrate (2) (68:32 with catalyst (6)) the increase was less significant than hoped for and the distribution of intermediates was examined. The use of the crotyl as a “blocking group” was found to be moderately effective with 93% of the reaction proceeding through path B, however the diastereoselection achieved within path B was less than that obtained in the allyl case with a 78:22 mixture of (10a) and (10b) being formed (cf. (2) affords (5a):(5b)=90:10 with (6)). Coupled with the leakage to path A this distribution of intermediates accounts for the final stereochemical outcome of the reaction. As expected, treatment of (8) with catalyst (7) also gave good conversion to products, in a near identical ratio to that obtained from treatment of (2) with second-generation catalysts i.e. a slight preference for (3b). With the more reactive catalyst the blocking effect of the crotyl group was less effective (60% reaction through path B) and more significantly, as already shown when using second generation catalysts both path A and B are non-selective, leading to a near 1:1 mixture of (3a):(3b). While the increase in diastereoselectivity for reaction of (8) was not as significant as hoped, the ability to direct the course of the reaction through path B had been demonstrated and reactions of (9) were explored. The isopentenyl group would be expected to completely block path A, and as subtle differences on the oxygen substituent (allyl versus crotyl) can have a significant effect on diastereoselectivity within path B an improved selectivity might still be obtained. Indeed reaction of (9) with catalyst (6) gave an 86:14 mixture of (11a) and (11b) with no five membered rings detectable, however as already demonstrated this catalyst was not reactive enough to convert these compound to the desired spirocycles. Reaction of (9) promoted by catalyst (7) gave about 50% conversion to spirocyclic products [16], with the reaction proceeding almost entirely through path B, but in line with results from (2) and (8), there is little diastereoselectivity (Scheme 8 ). A solution to the problem was finally obtained by sequentially exploiting the selectivity that could be obtained with catalyst (6) and the reactivity of catalyst (7). Tetraene (9) was allowed to react with 5mol% of catalyst (6) at 0°C, which gave complete conversion to the two six membered rings (11a) and (11b) in an 84:16 ratio within 2h, at which time solvent was removed by nitrogen purge and replaced with butene. Catalyst (7) (10mol%) was then added to the reaction mixture, allowing for the second cyclisation to take place via initial cross metathesis of the isopropenyl group with the solvent. The reaction proceeded to >95% conversion, and a final ratio of 84:16 (3a):(3b) was obtained, representing the best selectivity obtained to date for this transformation (Scheme 9 ). In line with results from cyclisations of isolated (11a) and (11b), no conversion of the intermediate mixture was seen in the absence of catalyst activation, and ethylene activation of (7) was only moderately effective, giving 50% conversion to spirocycles. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, we have shown the course of a double RCM reaction can be diverted through a previously minor, but more selective pathway, to allow for higher selectivity to be obtained. Incorporation of blocking groups on the oxygen allyl group led to the reaction proceeding through initial formation of the six membered ring, with the selectivity depending on both the nature of the blocking group and the catalyst used. Judicious use of two catalysts allowed for the highest selectivity to be realized in the initial step, with a more reactive catalyst giving conversion to the desired spirocyclic product. While for practical purposes the extra synthetic steps required to differentiate the two allyl groups would make this a less attractive option that the original cyclisation of (2) this study provides valuable insight into how controlling the order of ring closing events [17] can have a profound effect on the stereochemical outcome of the reaction.
