While in use, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) catalysts accumulate transition metals, including iron, present in gasoil or resid feedstocks. This accumulation deteriorates catalyst performance in some (but not all) cases. While literature reports that iron degrades FCC catalyst performance and even defines an “iron threshold”, we have not noticed an iron-dependent degradation threshold in the field application of the FCC catalysts from the in situ synthesis route (a.k.a. in situ FCC catalysts). This work investigates two different in situ FCC catalysts that were used in different refineries with different sets of constraints and objectives. For each fresh catalyst, we chose a pair of equilibrium FCC catalysts (a.k.a. ecats) collected from actual FCC units. One from each pair came from a refinery with relatively low iron in its feed compared to a partner, from a different refinery, with more iron. As observed by others previously, in the high-iron ecats some of the iron occurs in nodules on the surface of FCC microspheres. Here we provide the first iron speciation of these ecats using low-temperature Mössbauer spectroscopy. While iron in fresh catalysts is mainly in isolated or highly disordered Fe(III) oxides, the ecats contain more Fe(II), Fe(III) oxides, and Fe(III)oxyhydroxides. However, the contaminant iron in these ecats appears to be not deleterious with regards to catalytic cracking chemistry; we do not observe iron-dependent differences for activity or target product selectivity for these in situ catalysts. Given that the current literature on iron contamination in FCC catalysts suggest deleterious effects and that said literature is based on catalysts manufactured via the incorporated method, the aim of this contribution is to investigate this industrial trend. Some possible reasons for iron tolerance for in situ FCC catalysts are discussed. Graphical Abstract ga1 Keywords Fluid catalytic cracking FCC Iron In situ synthesis Mössbauer spectroscopy Fluidized catalytic testing 1 Introduction Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) transforms heavy crude oil (gasoil and residue-containing, or resid) fractions into more valuable products including liquified petroleum gases, gasoline, and distillate precursors. The majority of gasoline consumed globally is produced by the FCC process and this process is expected to maintain its importance in the global transportation market in the near future. Propylene and other building blocks for the petrochemical industry are also being produced by FCC units—including related processes such as high severity FCC (HS-FCC), deep catalytic cracking (DCC), etc.—around the world with enhanced selectivity and in increasing quantities, ensuring that FCC catalysts will hold a central role in the field of crude oil-to-chemicals. Gasoil and resid feeds contain various amounts of contaminant metals that accumulate on FCC catalysts, posing problems for refiners in terms of operability and profitability targets. In that context, information and technologies that describe and combat metals’ deleterious effects are immediately useful to the refining industry. First-row transition metals (V, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn) occur in crude oil as geoporphyrins [1,2] that deposit and accumulate onto FCC catalysts. For decades [3–7] the literature has prominently discussed poisonous effects of Ni and V, in particular, in FCC catalysis. The very early FCC literature, from times before use of Y zeolite in cracking catalysis, reported that iron could also detrimentally alter selectivities, especially for coke [8]. Apparently, iron can also sometimes interact harmfully with amorphous silica-alumina cracking catalysts. The literature is less clear whether iron is detrimental for Y zeolite-based FCC catalysts [5,9–11]. More recently, iron has become a more investigated topic in FCC literature due, in part, to the tight oil boom in the United States. This boom, and its resulting effect on the industry, is expected to continue and possibly increase with continued tight oil production in the U.S. and potential tight oil exports from Argentinian shale oil reserves. Tight oils often contain very high amounts of iron (among other non-traditional contaminants) while carrying low amounts of the traditional contaminants, Ni and V. Operationally, iron can impart a number of issues. Physically, it can change the particle packing characteristics, changing catalyst circulation and fluidization properties [9]. Chemically, it can act as a weak promoter for the reaction of CO to CO2 in the FCCU regenerator [10], which can be an issue for partial burn operations, or as a weak dehydrogenation catalyst, resulting in higher yields of H2 and coke (both unfavorable). Catalytically, it can also change the behavior of the FCC catalyst in cracking reactions. Because of the introduction of this new feed into FCC units, iron contamination investigations began to increase, particularly to address this last point. Ocelli [5] reports that conversion and gasoline yield were not affected by iron up to 3 wt%. More recently however, reports can be found in the literature that iron appears detrimental. Rautainen and Foskett [11] indicate that iron causes an increase in bottoms (one of the least valuable products of the FCC process, also called Heavy Cycle Oil or HCO) with concomitant decreases in the more valuable light cycle oil (LCO), a diesel fuel precursor, or gasoline yield, or both. Yuxia et al. associate an increase in iron content on equilibrium catalyst (ecat) from the FCC unit with an increase in bottoms and coke. At higher iron content, yields [12] of LPG and gasoline declined while LCO yield increased. Others [13–16] assert that iron is detrimental in FCC catalysis, and indicate iron poisons through some sort of pore blocking mechanism, although neither characterization, activity, nor selectivity data for true ecats are provided. Importantly, when determining iron contamination levels one must consider the amount of contaminant iron, as opposed to the total iron. All fresh FCC catalysts have intrinsic iron originating from the raw clay-based materials. However, it is the contaminant iron level (total iron content minus the fresh catalyst iron content) on the ecat that is monitored by refiners. In one case, an “iron threshold” has been defined [17] as being 0.45 wt% added iron, at which point the FCC catalyst starts to exhibit signs of iron poisoning. More recently, groups led by Bare [18], Weckhuysen [19–22] and van Bokhoven [23,24] elegantly characterized particular FCC ecats using synchrotron radiation methods (including tomography) that enabled locating iron and assessing its effect on ecat pore structure. Iron seemed associated [19–22] with plugging pores near the exterior surface of microspheres and this, it was thought, was sufficient to explain severe iron poisoning. Very recently, Jiang and coworkers [25] showed that iron in superficial ecat nodules occurs as nanoparticles embedded in an amorphous matrix. Mössbauer spectroscopy provides precise information on Fe in a sample without bias toward larger, crystalline phases, but is under-explored in the poisoning of FCC catalysts. Souza et al. [26] reported limited FCC catalyst characterization using Mössbauer spectroscopy. However, Mössbauer spectra were acquired only at room temperature, which is often not particularly informative when iron is highly dispersed or in short range ordered (poorly crystalline or amorphous) phases as detection of these phases requires low-temperature measurement. More recently, Zhou and coworkers [27] attempted a detailed speciation of iron using several methods, including X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy and room temperature Mössbauer spectroscopy. In their work, XAS and Mössbauer spectroscopies agree that Fe(II) and Fe(III) can occur in ecats. But room temperature Mössbauer spectroscopy does not reveal the diversity in iron speciation that can be observed using Mössbauer spectroscopy at low (liquid helium) temperatures. Perhaps relevant to these analyses is the fact that the foregoing iron-contaminated catalysts were all manufactured following the so-called incorporated route (a.k.a. “incorporated FCC catalysts”). They were made [13,14] from slurries containing zeolite, matrix, clay, and a binder that is designed to minimize catalyst attrition. A different approach to making FCC catalysts is the so-called in situ process. In this approach, a mixture of calcined and uncalcined kaolin clay is spray dried and then calcined to convert kaolinite to metakaolin. Then, zeolite is grown in situ in the nascent FCC microsphere [28]. After ion exchange and related workup, a finished FCC catalyst is produced. In this approach, the Y zeolite itself serves as the binder by improving the structural integrity of the FCC microsphere [29]. External binder might play a role in iron poisoning phenomena reported in the industry [14]. BASF maintains a database [30] of ecat samples representing refineries from around the world. This database contains ecats from both incorporated and in situ technologies. It should be noted that this database contains more data points from FCC units utilizing in situ catalysts. The contaminant Fe content is calculated by subtracting fresh catalyst Fe content from ecat Fe content. Fresh catalyst Fe content of in situ catalysts is known to the authors, while the fresh catalyst Fe content of the incorporated catalyst technologies was estimated based on the minimum Fe level observed for incorporated catalyst ecats, assuming these minima represented no Fe contamination, an assumption often confirmed by the refiners. As shown in Fig. 1, a survey of the FCC industry ecats (annual average between 2013 and 2014, when iron in FCC feed was at its historically highest level) indicates that for the refineries who operated with almost no (i.e., 0–0.1 wt%) contaminant Fe, the refineries did not discriminate between catalyst technologies where 52 % used an in situ catalyst while 48 % used an incorporated catalyst. However, as contaminant iron increased, the number of FCC units who utilized an in situ manufactured catalyst technology increased, with the handful of refineries in the world running at the highest contaminant Fe (>0.6 wt%) using in situ catalysts exclusively. One of the goals of this study is to investigate this industrial trend. In this contribution, we examine two different FCC catalysts in units that result in high or low contaminant iron. Two in situ FCC ecats with high contaminant-iron were chosen and matched as well as possible to two in situ ecats with similar underlying technology and physical properties, but with significantly lower contaminant-iron levels. We then analysed the FCC catalysts with variable-temperature Mössbauer spectroscopy and assessed catalyst activities and selectivities using industrial benchmark fluid-bed testing methods [31]. While we do observe peculiar surface morphology of the high iron ecats that has been observed previously, [11–16,18–24] we do not observe any evidence for impaired porosity or catalytic performance, as defined by previous literature (i.e. impaired bottoms upgrading capability or increased dry gas yield) in the high iron ecats compared to their low iron control ecats. In that respect, we highlight the difference between iron contamination and iron poisoning—terms that can sometimes be incorrectly interchanged. 2 Methods Fresh and ecat FCC catalyst analysis experiment: Based on our Fe contamination series, we selected two types of in situ catalysts (A and B) for more thorough analysis. Each catalyst was characterized in its fresh state. We chose these particular catalyst designs because they had the same underlying technology design and are commonly used in refineries with both high and low amounts of contaminant iron. We then chose 4 ecats, 2 from each underlying technology, each from a different refinery, from our database of ecats. Our selection process further included attempts to match other used (ecat) catalyst properties, such as levels of contaminant Ni and V, as well as possible. All samples were collected within 6 months of use at their respective refineries and stored at ambient conditions. Their potassium content was always below 1000 ppm and sodium content did not exceed 0.5 wt%. Physicochemical properties of the fresh catalysts and of the high and low-iron ecats (pairings 1 and 2, respectively) are provided in Table 1. Some iron, about 0.5 wt%, is present in the fresh catalyst. The two high-iron ecats (A1 and B1) possess 1.0–1.4 wt% total iron as opposed to 0.6–0.7 wt% total iron for their lower iron ecat (A2 and B2) partners. Elemental analysis of the catalysts was conducted by X-ray Floresence (XRF) using a Philips PW2400 spectrometer, with fused pellet specimens; data were accurate within 1 % relative abundance. BET (TSA) surface area was determined using N2 adsorption data acquired using a Micromeretics Galaxy 3060 sorptometer. T-plot external area (MSA) was calculated from the same N2 isotherms. Results have a precision of about ± 2 % relative. Total pore volume was determined by mercury intrusion using a Micromeretics Autopore IV sorptometer, measuring pores between 0.003 µ and 360 µ. Pore volume uncertainty is about 0.02 ml/g. Unit cell size was determined following ASTM D3942. X-Ray diffraction data were collected using a PANalytical MPD X′Pert Pro diffractometer, with Cu radiation and Si was used as an internal standard. The unit cell size uncertainty of our estimates ranges from 0.004 to 0.01 Å. As discussed in greater detail in Supplemental Material, 57Fe Mössbauer spectra were acquired using a SEE Co Mössbauer spectrometer at room temperature, 5 K and, in some cases, at 77 K. Magnetic susceptibility measurements were conducted at room temperature using a Bartington MS3 meter and MS2B sensor. Catalytic measurements were made using an ACE™ fixed fluid bed reactor [31] as discussed below. Before conducting any catalytic evaluations, all samples undergo a short muffle step (593 °C, 2 h, ambient air) to remove any residual carbon. This has an added benefit to bring metals, particularly vanadium, to a similarly oxidized state. 3 Results This study focuses on iron speciation and catalytic comparisons of otherwise similar ecats containing relatively high and low amounts of iron. This is a natural experiment; conditions the two different base catalysts experienced in different FCC units is outside our control. All ecat samples were provided by their respective refineries. Importantly, the high contaminant iron ecat (A1 and B1) users reported no ill-effects relating to iron during these time periods and operated with high amounts of contaminant iron for years at a time (depending on crude oil availability). To demonstrate this point, the contaminant iron content for the refinery corresponding to A1 is shown in Fig. 2. Table 1 details physicochemical properties of catalysts investigated in this work. While Ni concentrations were well matched for the two pairings of ecats, V concentrations are only well-matched for Catalyst A and poorly matched for Catalyst B. The two Catalysts A have different lanthanum content, reasonably [32] but unfortunately leading to rather different ecat Y zeolite unit cell sizes. As one would expect, the lower La catalyst (A2) has lower ecat unit cell size. Nonetheless, catalytic activity overlaps (as shown below), so selectivities of Catalysts A may be compared with a good level of confidence. Ecat properties for Catalysts B also show notable differences (Table 1). V and unit cell parameter differ. Pine et al. [33] have shown that unit cell size is an excellent predictor of Y zeolite activity for gasoil cracking. V and unit cell parameter differences reinforce an expected activity trend. High V content, by driving Y zeolite amorphization [6] and thereby decreasing surface area, could decrease catalyst activity in similar ways as a low unit cell size. These considerations lead us to expect that catalyst B1 should have inferior catalytic properties than B2. Inasmuch as B1 has higher iron content, it is difficult to assess a detrimental effect. On the other hand, if iron were a strong poison, B1 should have strongly inferior catalytic properties compared to B2. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed presence of Y zeolite, mullite, γ-Al2O3, anatase, and, in most cases, rutile (our XRD detection limit for anatase and rutile in these catalysts is ~0.2 wt%), as expected given that total Ti is ~1 wt%. However, X-ray diffraction failed to detect any iron phases in either the fresh catalysts or the ecats. This prompted us to employ 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, which can provide Fe speciation and mineral composition irrespective to phase crystallinity. Mössbauer (MB) spectra of the six catalysts (fresh and high/low ecats) were collected at 295 K, 5 K and, in some cases, at 77 K. Analysis of spectra acquired at 5 K yield the most useful chemical information because most Fe oxides and hydroxides of even very low crystallinity will be magnetically ordered and display a sextet. Mössbauer fit parameters (isomer shifts, quadrupolar splittings, and hyperfine field strengths) are provided in Tables S-1 through S-6 in the supplementary material and are based on fitting procedures described by Rancourt and Ping [34]. Spectra for Catalysts A are shown in Fig. 3; those for Catalysts B in Fig. S-B. Iron Speciation in the Fresh Catalysts: iron species are detected in Fresh Catalyst A. About one-third of the iron in Fresh Catalyst A occurs as non-magnetically coupled Fe(III) atoms consistent with FeIII substitution in aluminosilicate-based minerals (namely Y zeolite, mullite, or silica-stabilized γ-Al2O3 derived from kaolinite calcination) or complexed by organic material or present as adsorbed cations. This species manifests as a doublet in the MB spectra and does not magnetically order at 5 K. Since fresh catalysts are made using inorganic chemical processes, organic species are absent, this species is likely Fe(III) substituted in Y zeolite or in aluminosilicates derived from calcined kaolin clay. About 10 % of the iron in Fresh Catalyst A is present as Fe(II) species either substituted in the zeolite or clay or adsorbed to other phases in the mineral matrix; this ferrous species also does not order magnetically at 5 K. About 20 % of the iron in the Fresh Catalyst A occurs in Fe(III) oxide phases such as hematite or perhaps maghemite, and is magnetically ordered at 5 K, yielding a 6-line spectrum. This phase likely originates as trace contaminant Fe (oxyhydr)oxide particles associated with the original kaolinite clay that are then ripened to Fe oxide phases during the heating associated with catalysis manufacturing. About one-third of iron occurs in species that are close to their magnetic ordering temperature at 5 K and appears as partially-collapsed sextet (or very broad singlet) with low isomer shift, indicating ferric iron phases. These phases are likely < 5 nm in size and very highly substituted, yielding a disordered magnetic structure. They are best represented by ferrihydrite-like phases that have co-precipitated with organic matter or perhaps inorganic Al or Si. No stoichiometric magnetite was detected as a major component. Consistent with this, the mass-specific magnetic susceptibility (MS or χ, Table 1) is relatively low for catalyst A2 (with almost no contaminant Fe) and is what would be expected for antiferromagnetic and superparamagnetic Fe(III) phases such as goethite, hematite or ferrihydrite phases (e.g., 100–300 × 10−8 m3 kg−1 FeOOH) [35]. Iron speciation, as revealed by our Mössbauer analysis, is provided in Table 2 as atom% of iron along with mass% of catalyst, by utilizing results of XRF chemical analysis. Relative error for the atom% results are typically about 20 %. The highest relative error is for isolate Fe(II) in Fresh B, where the relative error is 40 %. 3.1 Iron speciation in the ecats Across all samples, about 0.1–0.2 wt% iron occurs as isolated Fe(III) species. The abundance of this iron generally decreases as the catalyst evolves from fresh catalyst to ecat. This iron likely substituted in aluminosilicate-based minerals (namely Y zeolite, mullite, or silica-stabilized γ-Al2O3 derived from kaolinite calcination) or complexed by organic material or present as adsorbed cations. Kaolin is the feedstock mineral used to manufacture the catalyst, and the quadrupole splitting values for these samples (QS (quadrupole splitting) values of 0.7–1.3 mm/s) are much higher than that typically found in FeIII substituted kaolinites [36] which typically yield lower QS values (e.g., ca 0.52 mm/s), but these isolated Fe(III) QS values are consistent with those associated with kaolin firing [18]. During clay firing significant increases in the QS values of Fe substituted kaolin occur as it transitions to metakaolin (QS increases to nearly 1.6 mm/s) and subsequently drops (to ~ 1 mm/s) as metakaolin transitions further to a Si-Al spinel and then to mullite [37]. Fe(III) oxide phases comprise the bulk of the magnetically ordered iron components in the ecats. These phases, which would include hematite, maghemite and non-stoichiometric magnetite, can be difficult to distinguish from each other using Mössbauer if they are short-range-ordered or poorly-crystalline like those in the ecats. Some minor magnetic ordering of Fe-oxide phases is observed in all ecats at room temperature, but these all have broad line widths suggesting that even the Fe-oxides phases are of small particle size or high disorder. Regardless, much more Fe(III) oxide phases occur in the high iron ecats than in fresh catalyst or in low-iron ecats. Mass-specific magnetic susceptibility (MS, Table 1) of the ecats are quite high and suggest that ferrimagnetic phases such as maghemite, or non-stoichiometric magnetite are present in the ecats, especially those from the high Fe refineries, which had MS or χ values consistent with nearly all Fe present in such phases (e.g., ~50,000 × 10−8 m3 kg−1 γ-Fe2O3). Since we clearly observe some SRO (Short-Range Ordered)-Fe oxyhydroxides, such as ferrihydrite, this raises intriguing questions about possible presence of ferrimagnetic ferrihydrite that has been shown to form during heated transformations between ferrihydrite and hematite [38]. Although beyond the scope here, this aspect deserves further study. Fe(III) phases that only partially order magnetically at 5 K (highly disordered Fe(III) oxyhydroxides) and Fe(III) oxyhydroxides (ordered at 5 K, but with smaller sextet widths and broader lines than the Fe-oxide phases) are detected in most ecat materials. Precipitation of Fe phases accumulated from the feed oil would likely comprise a mixture of Fe(III) oxyhydroxides and these highly disordered phases. The amount of isolated Fe(II) species tends to be larger in ecat than in fresh catalyst. The ecats were analyzed by Mössbauer spectroscopy as received from the refineries, without additional calcination, and some contained volatile organic compounds that evaporated when placed in a moderate vacuum. It is possible that some of the isolated Fe(II) was present as organic complexes and the balance occurred as isolated atoms in silica-alumina environments. 3.2 Catalysis performance Fig. 4 shows aspects of catalytic performance pairs of Catalysts A and B, respectively, assessed in ACE™ fixed fluid bed cracking reactors [31]. Plots of bottoms vs coke are shown, since published literature indicates [11,12] that iron poisoning leads to both higher bottoms and higher coke. Data points are depicted along with least squares regressions of the data along with 90 % confidence bands. Why plot with coke as an independent variable? Commercial FCC units operate in a heat-balanced fashion. Heat generated by coke combustion in the regenerator is used to drive endothermic cracking reactions in the riser. To an oil refiner, coke is an independent variable that can be changed either by the catalyst or by various processing means. Practically, one wants to minimize both catalytic coke and bottoms, since they are the least valuable products of the cracking reaction. Other literature indicates that iron poisoning results in worse bottoms conversion (higher bottoms) and higher coke. Were iron poisoning observed in catalysts studied here, the coke/bottoms plot would be shifted upward and to the right for catalysts with high contaminant iron content, namely catalysts A1 and B1. Catalysts A display differences (Fig. 4, left) in conversion levels and in the amount of bottoms that remain after the catalytic reaction. These differences probably arise from differences in ecat unit cell size; the larger the Y zeolite unit cell size, the higher the conversion and the lower the bottoms [33]. But where conversion or bottoms overlap, high-iron A1 selectivities are about the same as low-iron A2 on an absolute number basis and are indistinguishable when taking into account the 90 % confidence bands. Although Catalyst B1 has twice the iron as B2, the coke / bottoms plots (Fig. 4, top right) for the two catalysts are the same. Another key catalytic signature of iron poisoning discussed in the literature [11] is an increase in dry gas. As shown in Fig. 4 (bottom), we see no evidence that higher contaminant iron content results in increased dry gas yield in these pairs of well-controlled catalysts. Perhaps one mechanism to explain the difference between in situ and incorporated catalysts with respect to iron tolerance, as alluded to above, relates to the binder (or lack thereof) used. Our analysis mainly considers in situ FCC catalysts while literature on poisoning from contaminant iron considers incorporated catalyst. In situ catalysts are made by spray drying a mixture of calcined and uncalcined kaolin clay, then calcining the preformed microsphere to convert kaolinite to metakaolin, and then growing Y zeolite in situ in the preformed microsphere, a process notably lacking added binder. Metakaolin serves as the limiting reagent for Y zeolite growth. Incorporated catalysts are made by spray drying a mixture of Y zeolite, optionally additional alumina and kaolin clay materials, and a binder material. One theory involves the potential migration of binder material (either Al-sol or Si-sol based) during the spray drying process towards the surface of the spherical catalyst particle. If that were indeed true, it would induce the formation of an Al- or Si- rich outer ring on the catalyst particle. Although outside of the scope of this contribution, a short investigation was done to explore this hypothesis. Cross-sectional SEM imaging was conducted on in situ, Al-sol, and Si-sol based ecats. As seen below ( Fig. 5), SEM imaging uncovers an Al-rich ring in the Al-sol based catalyst, a Si-rich ring on the Si-sol based catalyst, and no such enrichment on the catalyst manufactured via the in situ route. A further hypothesis suggests that these enriched (in Si or Al) surfaces might suffer from iron deposition earlier (i.e. at lower contaminant Fe concentrations) than their in situ manufactured counterpart due to the nature of the resulting surface porosity. This hypothesis merits future study. 4 Discussion Our results provide aspects of agreement and disagreement with literature reports. First, we consider areas of general agreement with previous results. As found previously, iron deposition onto FCC catalysts is associated with the formation of notable morphological features (a.k.a. nodules) on the exterior of the used catalysts (ecats). Fig. 6 shows representative SEM micrographs of the A1 and A2 ecats. A1 clearly shows nodules, which EDS confirms are iron-rich, while external surfaces of A2 microspheres are smooth and do not have nodulation due to iron deposition. These microns-sized nodules with substantial iron content do not result in ordered iron domains large enough to be detected as specific phases by X-ray diffraction. Literature suggests [11,19,20,23] that higher ecat iron content should lead to lower pore volumes as the iron accumulates and blocks or clogs the pores. As seen in Table 1, we find no evidence to support this for these catalysts. The high iron ecats (A1 and B1) have the same pore volume as their low iron counterparts (A2 and B2), as measured by HgPV, suggesting that the accumulated iron on A1 and B2 have not (yet) clogged the pores. This highlights one of the shortcomings in the field since pore volume as measured by intrusive methods (e.g. HgPV) is not a measure of the surface porosity, the key determinant to tolerance to the physical iron blockage. Since the iron blockage occurs on the surface of the catalyst particles, the internal pore network would remain largely unaffected, rendering a total pore volume measurement that does not describe or detect blockage by contaminant iron. The result found here suggests that total pore volume in fact is not an adequate parameter by which to measure blockage by iron or that blockage by iron has not occurred. Low-temperature Mössbauer results provide new information consistent with a picture of highly disordered iron species. The fresh catalysts already possess some iron, derived from the mined kaolin clay catalyst precursors. Much of this initial Fe is present as Fe(III) and minor Fe(II) substitutions in the Y zeolite, mullite, and silica-stabilized γ-Al2O3 phases or Fe-oxide precipitates (and some highly disordered Fe(III) phases) that likely formed external to these structures during the catalyst manufacturing process. This finding is similar to that by Souza et al. [26] who found, even at room temperature Mössbauer, that fresh catalyst iron is mostly (57–72 %) found in its Fe(III) state along with smaller contributions of Fe(II). Iron speciation in the ecats is different than in the fresh catalysts. Furthermore, unlike the previous Mössbauer studies on FCC ecats, we are able to deduce iron species with more definition as they begin to order at lower temperatures. The ecats can have up to three times more ferrous iron (Fe(II)). Amounts of Fe(III) species that order magnetically at 5 K also increase substantially (between 1.9 and 5.2X higher) in the high-Fe ecats, but do not change much (36 % decline to 50 % increase) in the low-Fe ecats. In no case do we detect mixed valent iron phases like magnetite, although some non-stoichiometric magnetite could be present. Non-isolated Fe(III) species increase (between 2.6 and 3.5X higher) in high-iron ecats compared to fresh catalysts; whereas the amount of non-isolated Fe(III) species increase more modestly (1.3–1.5X) in the low-iron ecats. Iron nodules, reported before in the literature, are observed for all the high-iron ecats but amongst the low-Fe ecats, only for B2. As discussed below, we believe the Fe(III) oxyhydroxide is not formed in the FCC unit but subsequent to its exit from the unit. Perhaps about 0.40 wt% of highly dispersed iron(III) entities on FCC catalyst exterior surfaces that order magnetically at 5 K is sufficient to cause the formation of iron nodules in those locations. Put another way, nodules may form when contaminant iron that occurs as non-isolated Fe(III) exceeds a concentration of about 0.25 wt%. But even when the concentration of these materials approach 1 wt%, as is the case for B1, Fe(III) oxides are not observed by X-ray diffraction. We do observe rutile in some of these materials at concentrations as low as about 0.2 wt%, but that rutile occurs as large, ordered crystallites. If organically complexed Fe present in the feed oil collects on the catalyst surface, it may begin to form short-range-ordered (poorly-crystalline) Fe phases. These phases would most likely be disordered phases that are highly substituted by organic compounds. The accumulation of Fe(III) oxyhydroxides (e.g., in A1) and Fe-oxides (e.g., in B1) that order at only low temperatures (i.e, 5 K) observed for the high feed-iron ecats (A1, B1) are consistent with this hypothesis. There is some accumulation of these phases in samples that do not contain nodules, but as illustrated above, they are of lower concentration. The coexistence of Fe(II) species with very poorly crystalline Fe(III) phases suggest they are located in physically distinct portions of the material. Tronc et al. [39], Benner et al. [40], Liu et al. [41], Yee et al. [42], Tishchenko et al. [43], and others discuss ability of ferrous species to catalyze crystallization of Fe(III) materials to stable phases such as goethite, magnetite, and hematite when Fe(II) sorbs to Fe (oxyhydr)oxide surfaces in an aqueous environment. The literature reports [39–43] all involve low-temperature, aqueous processing. When only catalytic amounts of Fe(II) are available, hematite or goethite are formed. At higher iron content, Fe(II) can incorporate into the solid state as magnetite or, in natural biogenic environments, sometimes as a green rust material [44]. This low-temperature aqueous chemistry involves mobility of chemically active Fe(II) species. It could be that sufficient amounts of Fe(II) are present to convert a substantial amount, or in some cases, all of the short-range-ordered Fe(III) to magnetite, but this is not observed in FCC applications. This is consistent with the idea that iron is not mobile in these ecats. Further support for immobility of iron under FCC process conditions is provided, indirectly, by the observation of Fe(III) oxyhydroxides that have MB parameters more consistent with nano-goethite than ferrihydrite in the B2 ecat. While Fe(II) can promote the transformation of highly dispersed Fe(III) moieties [40], this probably did not occur in the FCC unit since at least bulk-crystalline goethite cannot form at temperatures above about 300 °C [45,46]. We suspect that the magnetic-domains of the SRO Fe(III) oxyhydroxides that are consistent with nano-goethite more likely formed while the sample was stored at ambient temperatures and humidity prior to analysis. Adventitious moisture may have solvated Fe(II) allowing it to catalyze nano-goethite formation. Our work here does not support the speculation that iron nodules formed on FCC catalysts are a result of melting and recrystallization processes [13] as there does not appear to be reactions between the highly dispersed Fe(II) moieties and very poorly ordered Fe(III) oxides. In addition, our Mössbauer results are not consistent with existence of mixed valent Fe(II)/Fe(III) moieties that would form in a melt. Melt formation is not expected, in any event, since melts do not occur at temperatures below 1000 °C [47,48] while FCC regenerator conditions rise to only about 750 °C. Now we consider catalytic results. The activities of Catalysts A1 and A2 are different. Catalyst A2, with a relatively small Y zeolite unit cell of 24.286 Å, registers lower conversion and higher bottoms in the catalytic evaluation than A1, with a larger cell parameter of 24.318 Å. The activity differences are easily understood [33] given the difference in unit cell parameter. Selectivities are best compared at constant conversion and where conversion overlaps, selectivities for these two catalysts are the same, within reasonable error. We find no evidence that the relative high iron content of A1, nor the presence of iron nodules on A1, has a detrimental impact on catalytic performance. The full conversion data (as conversion versus catalyst to oil ratio) and selectivity data (regressed to constant conversion) for catalysts A1, A2, B1, and B2 are offered in Figs. S-E and S-F and Tables S-7 and S-8. High-iron B1 shows very similar coke / bottoms selectivities to low-iron B2. Catalyst B1 has the highest contaminant-iron content (0.78 wt%) of all catalysts investigated here. The coke selectivities of the two catalysts are similar and B1 is slightly better at upgrading bottoms to LCO (not shown). B1 has a small gasoline conversion penalty compared to B2 and makes less gasoline and LPG. B1 also makes more undesired H2. But we do not assign those performance penalties to higher iron content. Literature suggests [11,19,20,23] that when iron is poisonous, it is due to its presence somehow causing a decline in pore volume and a blockage of the surface porosity. But pore volume (and, indeed, pore size distribution measured by Hg intrusion) for B1 and B2 are very similar. Literature also indicates that a signature of iron poisoning is a decline in LCO/bottoms [12] but B1 shows an increase. Besides having high iron, B1 also has nearly twice the vanadium as B2. In this connection, it is relevant to note that the small conversion penalty observed for B1 is associated with lower yields of gasoline and LPG but higher H2 yield. These observations are consistent with vanadium poisoning. Rautainen and Foskett state [11] that an increase in contaminant iron of about 0.2 wt% can cause iron poisoning. Their work shows [11] that bottoms conversion penalties are iron level dependent, with larger penalties at higher contaminant iron content. Yuxia and coworkers show [12] than an increase in contaminant iron of 0.16 wt% from a base case is associated with 7 % relative increase in coke and a 40 % relative increase in bottoms. The amount of contaminant iron present in the base case [12] is not known precisely but is at least 0.26 wt%. That is, 0.26 wt% contaminant iron was tolerated but 0.42 wt% contaminant iron was quite detrimental. Based on the above literature, contaminant iron in the range of about 0.3–0.4 wt% is expected to degrade catalyst performance. By contrast, our results indicate iron tolerance for these in situ FCC catalysts. Contaminant iron in the range of 0.47–0.78 wt% does not perturb the bottoms/coke trade-off observed for catalysts with similar technology where contaminant iron is in the range of 0.07–0.17 wt%. 5 Conclusions Our results contrast prior literature indicating that iron is a strong poison in ecats, but these prior reports [13,15] were for FCC catalysts made with Al-sol, Al-gel, or Si-sol technologies. These sols and gels are used as binders in many kinds of FCC catalysts. Perhaps these binder packages are what detrimentally interact with iron. The in situ FCC catalysts discussed here use Y zeolite, not sols or gels, as the binder. To the extent that the sol and gel binder components discussed by others are associated with iron poisoning, that could not occur with the catalysts investigated here because those sol and gel components are not present. Clay minerals, predominantly kaolinite, is also used in FCC catalysts. When used in incorporated catalysts, the kaolinite transforms mainly to metakaolin in the FCC unit. There are suggestions in the literature that metakaolin [23] may detrimentally interact with iron. Metakaolin is not present in in situ FCC catalysts since metakaolin is consumed when Y zeolite is grown in situ in the FCC microsphere. Our work differentiates iron contamination from iron poisoning. If the various assigned possible causes of iron poisoning are correct, it is likely that in situ catalysts are inherently resistant to iron poisoning. The fundamental understanding of contaminant metals deposition is a key step in developing and understanding technologies that are capable of metals tolerance. This work aims to further build on the existing knowledge of iron contamination in FCC catalysts and attempts to correlate phenomena observed in the field with fundamental research. With this contribution, it is our hope to not only complement the existing science, but also to provide industry-relevant information for the means of troubleshooting as well as catalyst design, selection and optimization. Perhaps one possible repercussion of these iron contamination investigations is a higher acceptance, by refining companies, in the future of crudes containing high amounts of iron. These so-called opportunity crudes represent a chance for refiners to obtain feedstocks at a low purchase price, meaning the likelihood for profit is higher if the opportunity crudes can be successfully refined.

        "dc:description": "While in use, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) catalysts accumulate transition metals, including iron, present in gasoil or resid feedstocks. This accumulation deteriorates catalyst performance in some (but not all) cases. While literature reports that iron degrades FCC catalyst performance and even defines an “iron threshold”, we have not noticed an iron-dependent degradation threshold in the field application of the FCC catalysts from the in situ synthesis route (a.k.a. in situ FCC catalysts). This work investigates two different in situ FCC catalysts that were used in different refineries with different sets of constraints and objectives. For each fresh catalyst, we chose a pair of equilibrium FCC catalysts (a.k.a. ecats) collected from actual FCC units. One from each pair came from a refinery with relatively low iron in its feed compared to a partner, from a different refinery, with more iron. As observed by others previously, in the high-iron ecats some of the iron occurs in nodules on the surface of FCC microspheres. Here we provide the first iron speciation of these ecats using low-temperature Mössbauer spectroscopy. While iron in fresh catalysts is mainly in isolated or highly disordered Fe(III) oxides, the ecats contain more Fe(II), Fe(III) oxides, and Fe(III)oxyhydroxides. However, the contaminant iron in these ecats appears to be not deleterious with regards to catalytic cracking chemistry; we do not observe iron-dependent differences for activity or target product selectivity for these in situ catalysts. Given that the current literature on iron contamination in FCC catalysts suggest deleterious effects and that said literature is based on catalysts manufactured via the incorporated method, the aim of this contribution is to investigate this industrial trend. Some possible reasons for iron tolerance for in situ FCC catalysts are discussed.",
