The T, for solid TPPTS is 1150 s while for TPPTS in a supported aqueous phase T, varies from 220 to 4.9 s. A T, of 4.9 s is close to the value obtained for TPPTS in solution and is observed at a H20/P ratio of 24.9. At this level of water content previously reported SAP catalysts have shown maximum catalytic activity for the hydroformylation of olefins.

Introduction The activity of supported aqueous phase (SAP) catalysts derived from the water soluble rhodium complex HRh (CO) (TPPTS) 3 and excess TPPTS (where TPPTS = trisulfonated triphenylphosphine trisodium salt) for the hydroformylation of liquid olefins is strongly dependent on water content [ 1-3 ] . The SAP catalysts are prepared on the controlled pore glass CPG-240 which has an average pore diameter of 240 A and a surface area of 78 m2 g-t 3. It was shown that an SAP * Corresponding author.

Further increases in water content caused the activity to diminish until very little catalytic activity was observed at a water content of 45 wt% or greater. At this level of water it is possible that the pores of the controlled pore glass support are filled completely which prevents good contact of the supported aqueous catalytic phase and the nonaqueous substrate phase. It was argued that the observed rise in activity at low water content may be due to increased mobility of the metal complex in the adsorbed aqueous phase [ 1,2]. Consistent with increased complex mobility is the fact that solution NMR techniques can be used to record the 3tP NMR spectrum of SAP catalysts that contain > 25 wt% water while magic angle spinning NMR techniques are required to observe the 3'P NMR spectrum at a water content of < 3 wt% water [2]. The aqueous nature of the adsorbed water layer in SAP catalysts at low water content has been questioned [ 4 ] . Specifically, there appears to be insufficient water, at low water content, to `dissolve' the metal complex and the excess phosphine on the surface. At the same time, however, it was confirmed that the catalysts have good long term stability and that activity depends on water content. Spin lattice relaxation times, TI, are proportional to molecular correlation times, T,, and, in the solid state, Tt's diminish as correlation times become shorter 4. Thus 3'P NMR spin lattice relaxation times may be used as an indication of the mobility of HRh (CO) (TPPTS) 3 (ads) and TPPTS (ads) in SAP catalysts. Calculation of molecular correlation times, however, requires a complete description of all relaxation processes. The analysis can be simplified by eliminating the dipolar relaxation pathway; this is done experimentally by replacing hydrogen with deuterium. For the SAP catalysts this requires the preparation of perdeutero TPPTS, which was not attempted. Instead, the spin lattice relaxation times are used qualitatively to determine the onset of liquid-like character for the supported aqueous phase. The results from T, experiments on SAP catalysts are described here. Spin lattice relaxation times for TPPTS, its oxide, and HRh (CO) (TPPTS) 3, are presented in Table 1. Spin lattice relaxation times as a function of water content ' This is true when o)or, > 1, that is for relatively long molecular correlation times as expected in the solid state. See, for example: [ 5 ] or [ 6 ] . B.B.

Water content is expressed both in terms of weight percent and the molar ratio of water to total phosphine, including the phosphine complexed to rhodium. It is more meaningful to compare molar ratios with previously prepared catalysts since the total loading of phosphines required for T, measurements is larger than used in the catalytic studies. The higher phosphine loading is needed for good signal-to-noise ratios. Even at high phosphine loadings, the determination of T, for a given sample required 1 to 5 days depending on the value of T,. As seen from the data in Table 1 of all the phosphorus containing components of the SAP catalysts, TPPTS, TPPTS = O, and HRh(CO) (TPPTS)3, the free phosphine shows the largest variation in T, in going from the solid state to solution. The 3'P spin lattice relaxation time of HRh(CO) (TPPTS)3 on CPG-240 approaches the solution value even at very low water content (Table 2). This makes T, of HRh(CO) (TPPTS); a poor probe of the nature of the adsorbed aqueous phase. A similar problem exists for TPPTS oxide, i.e., on glass at low water content its T, is close to the solution value. In contrast the T, of TPPTS on CPG-240 is more sensitive to water content. Significantly, at a water content corresponding to a H20/P ratio of 24.9 the 3 `P spin lattice relaxation time for TPPTS on the controlled pore glass is 4.9 s, a value similar in magnitude to that observed for TPPTS in solution. The T, of TPPTS on the glass may be shortened, compared to the solid state, to some extent by additional relaxation pathways which may be available on the surface. A plot of T, vs. Hz0/P for TPPTS on CPG240 is presented in Fig. 1. Also indicated on the plot, by an arrow, is the H20/P ratio at which maximum catalytic activity for 1-octene was observed, namely H20/P=39. (This value is calculated from the composition of the supported aqueous phase catalyst at a water content of 8.5 wt%, specifically the SAP catalyst contains 3.6 wt% rhodium complex and 4.3 wt% phosphine.) Clearly phosphine mobility, as indicated by 3'P spin lattice relaxation times, approaches solution values by the time this level of water content is achieved. The results presented above allow us to speculate that adsorbed phosphine in SAP materials have mobility similar to that in aqueous solution at relatively low water content. Although the experiments do not demonstrate that mobility is a 160 B.B.

The phosphine loading is 16.9 wt%. necessary condition for good catalytic activity, it is true that the H201P ratio required for good catalytic activity ensures that the supported complexes have a high degree of mobility 5. In related work it has been recently shown by Renaud and Baird that the mobility of rhodium complexes of the cationic phosphines, [Ph2P(CH2) PMe3] + bound to cation exchange resins, as indicated by 3'P NMR spin lattice relaxation times, show little variation compared to their different catalytic activity [ 7 ] . 2. Experimental section Sulfonation of TPP and purification of the ligand TPPTS was accomplished by the procedure described by Bartik, et al. [ 8 ] . The rhodium complex, HRh (CO) (TPPTS) 3, was prepared by the method outlined by Arhancet et al. [ 2 ] and Bartik et al. [ 9 ] .Immobilization of TPPTS and HRh (CO) (TPPTS) 3 on CPG240 and its subsequent hydration was done as described by Arhancet [21. All solutions of phosphine and rhodium complex were prepared under argon or dry ` In the limit of no water there is little opportunity for molecular motion for the surface species and T should be relatively long for these samples. Addition of small amounts of water thus should decrease the molecular correlation time .. the fact that T, decreases upon addition of water is consistent with &)o c > l over the range of the water content investigated in these experiments.

The adsorption of the water soluble compounds onto the glass was done under nitrogen. The SAP materials were loaded into the CP-MAS rotors under argon using a Schlenck transfer tube as described in Bunn's dissertation [ 10] . Thermogravimetric analyses to determine the water content of certain samples was performed by Polymer Solutions, Inc., Blacksburg, VA. All samples were kept under argon prior to analysis, and the TGA was performed under nitrogen. Solid-state NMR measurements were carried out on a Bruker MSL-300 multinuclear spectrometer with a wide bore magnet (7.05 T) at an observation frequency of 121.496 MHz for 3tP. Samples (approximately 200 mg) were placed in 4 mm zirconia rotors. Spinning rates of 6000 to 9000 Hz were used for the magic angle spinning experiments. The 90 pulse width was set with the Bruker HPDEC program on a sample of NaH2P04. The T, data were collected in the Bruker MMIRToNE program and were manipulated using the T, POINTS program. A pulse delay of > 5 T, was used for all Tt measurements. The probe was tuned and matched using HPDEc and WOBL programs supplied by Bruker. Chemical shifts are referenced to 85% H3PO4.
