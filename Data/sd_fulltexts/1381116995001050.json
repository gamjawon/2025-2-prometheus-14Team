The concentrations of tetrahedral oxygen-coordinated borate (B04) species as well as number of Brsted acid sites were found to increase with increasing boria content.

It is readily prepared by impregnation methods using boric acid solution and an alumina support [ 1,2] . The acid behavior of alumina-boria is reported to be due to strong Brsted acid sites [ 1,3]. The catalytic activities of alumina-boria are found to change with variation of the B203 (boria) content, and optimum boria contents have been found for such vaporphase reactions as toluene disproportionation [ 1 ] , m-xylene isomerization [ 3 ] ,and Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime [ 3,4] . Solid-state NMR techniques have been used to characterize structures of inorganic materials [ 59 ] . In the popular example of aluminosilicate zeo- * Corresponding author. 1381-1169/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

In particular, these techniques are effective in studying surface structures of amorphous solids, such as silica gels [6,7], silica-alumina [ 8 ] , and alumina [ 9 ] . Although t tB NMR has been used frequently for organoborane and haloborate compounds in the liquid state [ 10,11 ] , solid state 1 tB NMR applications were used only for the characterization of such materials as glasses, ceramics and zeolites. In Pyrex glasses [ 12-14] and zeolites [ 15,16],' NMR was used to detect tetrahedral oxygen-coordinated borate (B04) units in the complex patterns due to the quadrupole interaction of planar B03 units. Recently, B04 signals have been sep- 172 S. Sato et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 104 (1995)171-177 arated from those of B03 units by using a highspeed magic-angle spinning (MAS) technique, together with a high magnetic field [ 13,17 ] . We have developed an evaluation method for acid strength distribution of Brsted acid sites by using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of adsorbed 2,6-dimethylpyridine (2,6DMP) [ 18 ] . Since 2,6-DMP adsorbs only on Brsted acid sites, an acid strength distribution of Brsted acid sites was provided. The TPD technique can clarify the type, strength, and amount of acid sites for solid acids such as alumina and silica-alumina, by comparing a TPD profile of 2,6-DMP which adsorbs on Brsted acid sites with that of 3,5-DMP which adsorbs on both Brsted and Lewis acid sites. We have demonstrated that Lewis acid sites of alumina are changed into Brsted acid sites, together with a change in the acid strength, with increasing silica deposited on the alumina [ 18 ] . Although the catalytic activities of aluminaboria were studied previously, neither the surface structure of boria deposited on alumina nor their acid strength distribution was clarified [ 1-4] . In this paper, we investigate both surface borate structures and acid strength distributions of alumina-boria catalysts with different boria content by using \"B MAS NMR measurement and TPD of adsorbed pyridines, in connection with their catalytic properties for 1-butene isomerization. 2. Experimental 2.1. Samples Each alumina-boria sample was prepared by a conventional impregnation method. An alumina sample, DC-2282 supplied by Dia Catalyst Ltd. (specific surface area; 203 m2/g, pore volume; 0.80 ml/g), was immersed in an aqueous solution of boric acid (H3B03), and then the solution was dried. The resulting sample was calcined at 300 for 3 h. Each silica-boria sample was prepared in the same manner as for alumina-boria. A silica gel supplied by J.T. Baker was used as a support; it had a specific surface area of 290 m2/g. Sodium borate (Na2B407 ' l OH20) supplied by J.T. Baker was used as a reference. 2.2. NMR measurements \"B MAS NMR spectra were recorded at 192.55 MHz on a Bruker AM-600 multinuclear spectrometer, while a MAS spinner was rotated at a rate of 10 kHz. The hand-made spinner had a volume of 0.096 cm'. Repetition times of 0.2 s were allowed between 3.0 /-is pulses, and 2000 free induction decays (FID) were accumulated per sample; the 90pulse width for an aqueous sodium borate solution was 10.3 tt,s. \"B chemical shifts (in ppm) reported in this article are referenced to BF3 etherate. 2.3. TPD of adsorbed pyridines A sample (20 mg) held with quartz wool in a quartz tube was evacuated at 500 for 1 h prior to adsorption of pyridines. An excess amount of pyridine or 2,6-dimethylpyridine was injected at 200, followed by evacuation for 1 h. A TPD measurement was done from 200 to 700 at a heating rate of 5 K/min in a nitrogen flow of 70 ml /min. The desorbed pyridines were detected by a conductivity cell immersed in aqueous sulfuric acid. A cumulative amount of desorbed pyridines as a function of the desorption temperature was detected, and then differentiated to give a TPD profile as an acid strength distribution [ 18 ] . 2.4. Catalytic tests The isomerization of 1-butene was carried out in a closed circulation system (reactor volume, 200 cm') under the conditions of a 1-butene initial pressure of 19. kPa at 0. Prior to the reaction, a catalyst sample (50 mg) was preheated at 500 under reduced pressure (0.1 Pa). The catalytic activity was evaluated in terms of the first-order rate constant during the initial reaction period. S.

Results and discussion 3.1. \"B NMR spectra of catalysts Fig. 1 shows \"B MAS NMR spectra of an alumina-boric sample with 7 wt.% of boric. It has 2 sharp resonance peaks at 1 and 15 ppm (Fig. 1a), which are assigned as 4- and 3-coordinate boron sites ( B04 and B03 ) , respectively [ 13,17 ] . The sample was in the hydrated form because it had been stored open to the air after being calcined at 300. After the sample had been dehydrated by heating at 500 for 3 h, the peak at 1 ppm disappeared (Fig. 1-b). The peak at 1 ppm recovered after exposure to the air for 24 h ( Fig. 1-c ) . The NMR results show that the surface tetragonal B04 species are reversibly changed into trigonal B03 species during the hydration-dehydration 173 process. Because of the instability of the B03 species in air, it is speculated that the surface B03 species that are produced by the dehydration of tetragonal B04 species are very strained. Fig. 2 shows \"B MAS NMR spectra of alumina-boric at different bona contents. Every sample had 2 sharp peaks at 1 and 15 ppm; the intensity of the peak at 1 ppm increased with an increase in bona content. Thus, the ratio of B04 to B03 species increases with increasing boric content. Turner et al. demonstrated that quantitatively reliable B04/B03 intensity ratios were obtained for several borate samples, using high-field \"B MAS NMR [ 13 ] . In our preliminary experiments, B04/ B03 intensity ratio in sodium borate (Na2B40-, ~ lOHZO) was found to be 1, which is the same as that reported by Turner et al. Therefore, we can determine the amounts of bona species quantitatively by using peak areas of \"B NMR spectra. Accordingly, the concentrations of B03 and B04 species were calculated from the ratios of B03 to B04 species and the total bona content for each sample. The results are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 3 shows changes in the concentrations of B03 and B04 sites on the surface of the alumina-borias. Both the concentrations of B03 and B04 sites increased linearly with bona content. The line for B04 sites intersects the xaxis at 1.8 wt.% bona content.

Fig. 4 shows t tB MAS NMR spectra of hydrated silica-borias. These silica-boric samples also display both B04 and B03 sites at 1 and 15 ppm, respectively. In the same manner as for the alumina-boric case shown in Fig. 1, the B04 species at 1 ppm disappeared under heat treatment at 500, and the B04 species were recovered after adsorption of water ( spectra not shown). In contrast to the NMR spectra of alumina-boric shown in Fig. 2, the intensity of B04 species at 1 ppm was weak and the ratio of intensities of B04 to B03 was constant regardless of boric content. Thus, the silica-boric samples are dominated by B03 sites. Boric is known to be one of the most difficult substances to crystallize, and in the vit- S. Sato et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical I(1995) 171-177 reous state the structure consists of a 3-D network of partially ordered trigonal B03 units [ 19,20] . The NMR results of silica-boric indicate that the surface boric species are free boric, which has weak interactions with silica support. 3.2. TPD of adsorbed pyridines Fig. 5 shows comparisons of TPD spectra of pyridine and 2,6-dimethylpyridine (2,6-DMP) adsorbed on alumina-boric at different boric contents. For alumina used as a support there are two broad desorption peaks of pyridine at around 320 and 660 (Fig. 5-a), whereas small desorption peaks of 2,6-DMP were observed around 260 and 500 (Fig. 5-b). The peaks of 2,6-DMP are caused by desorption from weak Brsted acid sites [ 18 ] .

The significant difference between TPD curves of pyridine and 2,6-DMP indicates that Lewis acid sites dominate the alumina surface. The amount of 2,6DMP desorbed from a sample containing 5 wt.% of boric ( Fig. 5-d ) was larger than that of alumina ( Fig. 5-b ) . This indicates that Brsted acid sites are created on the alumina surface by depositing boric species. Since the difference between the TPD curves of pyridine and 2,6-DMP ( Fig. 5-c and d ) is contributed by Lewis acid sites, the sample with 5 wt. % boric has both Lewis and Brsted acid sites. At the higher boric contents of 10 and IS wt.%, there was no significant difference between the two TPD curves of pyridine and 2,6DMP (Fig. 5-e, f and 5-g, h). Thus, the aluminaboria samples have only Brsted acid sites. Since the amount of pyridine desorbed increases with boric content ( Fig. 5-a, c, e, g), the total number of acid sites increases with an increase in boric content. Fig. 6 shows changes in the amounts of both Brsted and Lewis acid sites with boric loading. The amount of Lewis acid sites, which was calculated from the difference between the amount of desorbed pyridine and desorbed 2,6-DMP, showed a maximum at a boric content of 3 wt.%; above this content it decreased slightly with increasing boric loading. On the other hand, the b 175 amount of Brsted acid sites calculated from the desorption of 2,6-DMP increased linearly with increasing bona content. Izumi and Shiba measured the acidity of alumina-boric in terms of both the total acidity, determined by titration with nbutylamine, and Lewis acidity, measured by the chemisorption of triphenylmethyl chloride [ 1 ] . Their results are consistent with our results shown in Fig. 6. In contrast to alumina-boric, silicaboria showed a small amount (0.003 mmol ~ g-' ) of adsorbed 2,6-DMP at 7 wt.% of boric. Because pyridine adsorbs on silica-boric samples [ 21 ] , Lewis acid sites were dominant on the silica-boric samples. The number of Brsted acid sites of alumina-boric ( Fig. 6 ) , as well as the concentration of B04 species (Fig. 3), increase with increasing boric content. This indicates that the Brsted acid sites of alumina-boric catalysts are correlated to the B04 species. The ratio of the total number of Brsted acid sites to the number of B04 sites, however, changed from about two fifths to one tenth, comparing the third and fourth columns of Table 1. Fig. 7 shows the variation in the Brsted acidstrength distribution measured by the desorption of 2,6-DMP. At a small boric content of 3 wt.% ( Fig. 7-b ) , the amount of 2,6-DMP desorbed near 300 was drastically increased by depositing this small amount of boric on the surface of alumina ( Fig. 7-a) .

Although the total amount of 2,6-DMP desorbed from a sample containing 15 wt. % boric was larger than that of the 10 wt.% boric sample, the acid strength was decreased because the sample had no distribution above 530 ( Fig. 7-d ) . A further decrease in acid strength was observed at a boric content of 20 wt.% because of no distribution above 500 (Fig. 7-e). Table 1 summarizes the surface acidic properties of alumina-boric catalysts together with the concentrations of B03 and B04 sites. The numbers of strong Brsted acid sites from which 2,6-DMP desorbed at temperatures higher than 400 and 450 were calculated by using the TPD curves shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 8 demonstrates the variation in the numbers of strong Brsted acid sites. The variation show maxima at boric contents of about 10 wt.%. In this figure, two broken lines through the three points for 3, 7, and 10 wt. % boric samples cross the x-axis at about 2 wt.% boric. As shown in Fig. 3, the line for B04 species also crosses the x-axis at 1.8 wt.% boric content. This correspondence indicates that, at boric contents less than 10 wt.%, strong Brsted acid sites of alumina-boric catalysts are correlated to surface B04 sites. 0 0 3.3. Catalytic activities for 1-butene isomeriZation Catalytic activity for the isomerization of 1butene is shown in Fig. 9. The catalytic activity changes with boric content, and is maximized at a boric content of 10 wt.%, which corresponds to a boric density of 0.5 mg ~ m-2. The aluminaboria system exhibits different catalytic activities for several reactions; maximum activities arise at surface bona densities of 0.6, 0.7, and 1.2 mg ~ m-2 for vapor-phase toluene disproportionation [ 1 ] , m-xylene isomerization [ 3 ] , and Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime [3,4], respectively. The value of 0.5 Mg. m-2 for 1-butene isomerization is similar to those for the toluene disproportionation and m-xylene isomerization. These small values are typical for reaction catalyzed by strong Brsted acid sites. A good correlation between catalytic activity for 1-butene isomerization and Brsted acidity measured by 2,6-DMP desorption has been reported for silica-alumina catalysts [ 18 ] . This reaction is catalyzed by strong Brsted acid sites from which 2,6-DMP desorbs at temperatures higher than 400. On the other hand, silica-boric samples have no catalytic activity for this reaction, because they have no strong Brsted acid sites from which 2,6-DMP could desorb above 400.

Sato et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical l(1995) 171-177 boria system, as represented in Fig. 9, is very similar to curve b in Fig. 8. This shows that much stronger Brsted acid sites, on which pyridine can adsorb even at a temperatures of 450, are efficient for 1-butene isomerization. In conclusion, the catalytic activity of aluminaboria is explained by the strong Brsted acid sites generated from B04 species on the surface of alumina. Acknowledgements We thank Dr. S.F.

Both surface borate structures and acidities of alumina-boria catalysts prepared by supporting B2O3 (boria) on an alumina support were investigated by using both 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR measurements and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of adsorbed pyridines, together with the catalytic properties of these alumina-boria materials for 1-butene isomerization. The concentrations of tetrahedral oxygen-coordinated borate (BO4) species as well as number of Brønsted acid sites were found to increase with increasing boria content. The catalytic activity for 1-butene isomerization was found to be caused by the strong Brønsted acid sites generated from BO4 species on the surface of alumina.
