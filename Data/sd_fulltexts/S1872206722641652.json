It is urgent to clarify the general rules to design and prepare intermetallic Pt-M catalysts with high ORR activity and stability. In this account, the basic principles for disorder-order phase transition in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics are first introduced and our recent efforts in synthesizing fully-ordered Pt-M intermetallic nanocrystals (iNCs) with well-defined L10-ordering structures are described. Then the effective strategies for further enhancing the activity and stability of L10-Pt-M ORR catalysts for PEMFCs are exemplified. We hope that this account will provide some significant insights into the research and development of intermetallic Pt-M alloy ORR catalysts for the applications of PEMFCs and other electrochemical energy conversion technologies in the future. Graphical Abstract This account summarizes the recent advance on synthetic methodology, structure-activity relationship, and stability regulation strategies of Pt-based intermetallic catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells. Keywords Fuel cell Oxygen reduction reaction Pt-based alloy catalyst Intermetallics L10-ordered structure 1 Introduction Hydrogen energy is widely deemed as a promising candidate for sustainable energy sources to replace traditional fossil fuels in response to serious energy crises and global pollution [1,2]. Among hydrogen energy based technologies, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have attracted considerable attention in view of their environmental friendliness, high energy conversion efficiency, quick start-up, and low operating temperature. Over the past decades, PEMFCs and related technologies have made significant progress in many fields, such as transportation applications, distributed power stations, and portable power supplies. However, the large-scale applications of PEMFCs are strictly limited by the high cost (primarily due to the use of noble metal catalysts, i.e., Pt) and deficient stability. Specifically, owing to the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode, a substantial amount of Pt-based catalysts (e.g., the Pt usage in a commercial Toyota Mirai vehicle > 20 g) is required to reduce the overpotential. Moreover, the serious degradation of ORR catalysts under the working conditions (pH < 1, cathode potential 0.6–1.5 V) leads to a short service life of PEMFCs [3,4]. Therefore, a variety of methods have been developed to reduce costs and improve the activity and stability of Pt-based ORR catalysts in the past few decades, including alloying with transition metals [5–7], the construction of special geometric morphologies [8–10], and the development of non-noble metal catalysts [11–13]. Taking Pt-M (M = Fe, Co, Ni, etc.) alloy catalysts as an example, the introduction of M usually promotes the oxygen reduction kinetics through electronic and/or strain effects, leading to a much enhanced ORR activity relative to Pt/C. Nevertheless, the inevitable dissolution of M in harsh electrochemical environments will also cause a rapid loss of activity. To improve the durability of Pt-M alloy ORR electrocatalysts, structurally ordered intermetallic catalysts has attracted considerable attention. Compared to disordered alloys, chemically ordered intermetallics usually exhibit strengthened interatomic bonding due to the strong orbital interactions during the disorder-to-order transition process, which is often accompanied by the decrease of enthalpy, leading to a better thermal stability of intermetallic alloys [14–16]. Taking the Pt-M alloy system as an example, alloying with Pt/M ratios of 3/1 and 1/1 favor L12- and L10-ordered structures, which could provide higher thermodynamically stability due to the more negative formation energy (e.g., −0.054 and −0.086 eV/atom for L12-PtCo and L10-PtCo, respectively) than that of corresponding disordered structure [17]. Especially, L10-ordered PtM structures reveal more negative formation energy than that of L12-ordered Pt3M ones (M = Fe, Co, Ni), so L10-ordered structures usually exhibit higher structural stability. Meanwhile, the ordered structures offer a much better tolerance against oxidation, acid corrosion and CO poisoning under the electrochemical environment [18]. The atomically ordered arrangement also produces different electronic structures and average Pt−Pt bond length (due to the different Pt-M/Pt-Pt bond ratios, e.g., 1/2, 2/1, and 1/1 for L12-Pt3M, L10-PtM, and fcc-PtM, respectively), which would significant affect the adsorption properties of reactants towards ORR activity enhancement [19]. Although intermetallic alloys exhibit so much superiorities for electrocatalysis, the synthesis of intermetallics is a grand challenge due to the high atom migration energy barrier and possible aggregation during the ordering process [20,21]. In this account, we present the general principles of the synthetic strategies, the structure-performance relationships, and key factors for regulating the activity for L10-Pt-based intermetallic nanocrystal (iNC) ORR catalysts. We also emphasize the critical factors for regulating the electrochemical stability of L10-Pt-M iNCs in the operating conditions of a PEMFC. The possible challenges faced by Pt-based intermetallic ORR catalysts for PEMFC applications are also summarized. We hope to provide general insights and future perspectives for the development of the Pt-based intermetallic ORR catalysts with high activity and enduring stability. 2 Synthesis of Pt-based iNCs via vacancy-mediated atomic diffusion The difference in Gibbs free energy (ΔG d→o) from the disordered to ordered structures is determined by entropy change (ΔS d→o) and enthalpy change (ΔH d→o) as the following equation [18,22]: (1) ΔG d→o = ΔH d→o − TΔS d→o where d and o represent the disordered and ordered structures, respectively. Since ΔS d→o is always negative for disorder to order transition process, it is clear that the entropy and enthalpy changes usually present a competitive relationship at high temperatures to generate a negative ΔG d→o. Therefore, it is necessary to offer an enough negative enthalpy change (as the driving force) to ensure the thermodynamic stability of the intermetallic phase alloy during the phase transition. As an example, even though the L11-PtAg structure is thermodynamically stable at ambient conditions, it hard to gain L11-PtAg iNCs during the annealing process with entropy in dominance [23,24]. At the same time, L11-PtAg is also absent at room temperature due to the high activation barrier of atomic diffusion. Thermal treatment is an effective strategy for preparing iNCs considering the high energy barrier during the disorder-order transition. In an early work, Sun et al. [25] obtained L10-PtFe iNCs through annealing at 600 °C to induce Fe and Pt atom rearrangement into the long-range chemically ordered structure. As the annealing temperature increases from 450 to 600 °C, the ordering degree of the nanocrystals can be further improved. Using the same approach, some other Pt-based iNCs with different structures and components could also be synthesized [26–28]. However, the accelerated diffusion of atoms during the high-temperature treatment can also aggravate Ostwald ripening and/or NC sintering, causing agglomeration and a broad size distribution of NCs. This will inevitably destroy the initial shape of NCs, causing a dramatic decrease of specific surface area and the variation of surface local site which can be unfavorable for the catalytic reactions. Based on the high-temperature sintering kinetics, loading nanocrystals on an inert support such as oxides can effectively reduce agglomeration [29]. Further, a protective carbon/oxide shell has also been used to prevent nanocrystals from agglomeration during annealing. Sun and co-workers obtained L10-PtFe nanoparticles (NPs) through thermal annealing of fcc-PtFe NPs encapsulated in MgO shells [30]. However, due to the limitation of the MgO shell, the atom mobility is restricted, leading to the partially ordered intermetallic NPs, thus requiring a higher transition temperature (550 vs. 750 °C) and prolonged annealing time (6 h) (Figs. 1(a) and (b) ). In view of diffusion dynamics, since the vacancy diffusion is the dominant diffusion process during the atom ordering transition, the atom jump rate in a coordination lattice can be determined as follows [31]: (2) D(T)~nzν exp(−Q/k B T) (3) Q = ΔG f + ΔG m where n and z are the concentration of the diffusing species and the coordination number, respectively, which depends on the local environment of the diffusing species and the specific crystal structure. ν is the pertinent attempt frequency related to the exchange rate between an atom and a vacancy. Q represents the energy barrier of the atom jump. And k B is the Boltzmann constant. ΔG f and ΔG m denote the vacancy formation energy and migration energy, respectively, serving as the driving force of the ordering process. For the vacancy-mediated diffusion process, vacancy sources including the intrinsic vacancy generated by thermal activation and the vacancy introduced during the synthesis process, could affect the diffusion process by lowering the migration activation energy barrier Q and increasing the migration rate D (Figs. 1(a) and (b)). Hence, it is feasible to accelerate diffusion by increasing the concentration of vacancy in the crystal lattice. In 2015, we reported an approach to monodisperse fully ordered L10-FePt NPs via controlled annealing of dumbbell fcc-FePt-Fe3O4 NPs [33]. Specifically, the dumbbell-like fcc-FePt-Fe3O4 NPs could be obtained through controllable decomposition of Pt(acac)2 and Fe(CO)5 to form fcc-PtFe NPs first and then grow excess Fe on the fcc-PtFe NPs, which could turn to Fe3O4 after oxidation. After annealing in the reductive gas, the vacancy would form by removing oxygen from Fe3O4, which could accelerate the diffusion of Pt and Fe to form a fully ordered L10 structure. The similar method can also be used for the preparation of L10-PtNi and L10-PtCo iNCs [34]. Fully ordered L10-PtNi, L10-PtCo and L10-Pt-Ni-Co NPs catalysts were successfully prepared through using core/shell Pt/metal oxide precursors (NiO x , CoO x , and NiCoO x ). During the ordering transition, agglomeration of NPs is reduced by the protection of metal oxides, while the formed O vacancies could adequately enhance the Pt/Ni/Co diffusion. On this basis, we then developed a self-protection method to prepare sub-4 nm ordered L10-PtZn/Pt NPs (Fig. 1(c)) [32]. The 2.5 nm Pt seeds were first synthesized and then coated with a ZnO matrix by thermal decomposition of Zn(acac)2. The dispersion of pre-synthesized Pt NPs in a 3D Pt@ZnO matrix causes physical isolation between NPs, which greatly prevents the agglomeration of particles during thermal annealing, and provides abundant oxygen vacancies during the reductive gas to promote the ordering transition. According to the Eqs. (2) and (3), the change of interatomic interaction (the incorporation of heterogeneous atoms) may also exhibit a similar effect on promoting atom migration since both ΔG f and ΔG m are related to the interatomic interactions. If doping atom (B) with a lower solubility in host atom (A), i.e., A-B interaction is weaker than that of A−A and B−B interactions, the strong tendency of doped atom (B) to segregate during thermal annealing can create more lattice vacancies and thus help host atoms to diffuse. For instance, L10-PtFe NPs have been prepared at a low annealing temperature (~300 °C) by doping Sb as a stabilizer [35]. The introduction of Sb is thought to be an effective approach to accelerate the diffusion of host atom through increasing lattice vacancy due to its low solubility and surface energy. Such approach of introducing low-solubility dopant atoms has also been explored to obtain other PtM systems by improving atom mobility. Zhang et al. [36] demonstrated a method to facilitate the FePt phase transition from fcc to L10 by doping Au. The surface segregation of Au is thermodynamically favorable due to the low surface energy and helps create lattice vacancies to promote the transformation. 3 ORR activity enhancement for Pt-based iNCs For some reactions, the ordered intermetallic alloy catalysts often exhibit higher specific activity compared to the random ones, such as the case of L10-FePt NPs for ORR [37]. It is worth emphasizing that Fe and Pt layers are alternately stacked, leading to a chemically ordered arrangement. The improved activity can be ascribed to both strain and ligand effects induced by structure transition (Figs. 2(a) and (b) ) [38–41]. Specifically, the ordered arrangement of lattice atoms provides a uniform and adjustable electronic structure for the surface. On the other hand, the change of lattice parameters induced by the structure transition creates surface strain originated from the lattice mismatch between the surface and the bulk. Lebedeva et al. [42] demonstrated a critical effect of the chemical ordering on the electrocatalytic activity of PtCo alloys (Fig. 2(c)). In their models, compared with the random alloy, the strong d-state hybridization between Pt and Co of ordered PtCo alloy could lead to the spin polarization of Pt surface layer. And this leads to a strong depletion of the density of states at the Fermi level as well as new unoccupied d states above the Fermi level, which is proved favorable to the electrochemical process occurring on the alloy surface [43]. Another obvious change of the electronic structure is the broadening and downshift of the d-band on account of the reduced Pt−Pt bond length in L10-PtCo alloy. Considering the effect of surface lattice mismatch, strain can also be a factor changing d-band [41,44]. Tensile strain leads to the narrowness of band, while compressive strain results in the band broadening. However, the ligand effect and the strain effect may play different roles in determining the origin of activity due to the discrepancy between actual catalytic models. Liu et al. [45] performed ab initio calculations to investigate the activity origin of Pt-M (M = V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) alloy with L10 ordered structure, and decomposed the activity improvement factor into the ligand, normal and shear strain effects (Fig. 2(d)). It is noteworthy that the ligand effect decreases significantly since the surface/sublayer ligands interaction decays exponentially with the increase of Pt layers, while the strain effect decays much less and can remain even at five atomic layers above the bulk (Fig. 2(e)) [46]. For the surface catalytic process, the bonding strength between the catalyst surface and the reaction intermediates can be neither too strong nor too weak, which are summarized as Sabatier principle [47]. The relationship between oxygen adsorption energy of PtM alloy surface and catalytic activity can be described as a volcanic-shaped diagram, in which L10-PtCo exhibits a competitive activity, but still shows a certain gap from the volcanic apex due to the over-weakened oxygen adsorption energy. Since adjusting the surface strain of intermetallic alloys can precisely tune the surface oxygen adsorption, it is a simple and effective approach to optimize catalytical activity. Therefore, we developed methods for introducing a small amount (5 at%–7 at%) of metal with different atomic radii (that is, 137, 133 and 122 pm for W, Zn and Ga, respectively) into PtCo alloy lattices (the atomic radii of Pt and Co are 138 and 125 pm, respectively) to regulate Pt-Pt distance (d Pt-Pt) and the local Pt strain [48]. ICP-MS results show that the sum of the content of the doped atoms (W, Zn and Ga) and Co is approximately equal to that of Pt, indicating that the doped atoms may replace Co in the lattice. XRD patterns and TEM images display a clear structure transition characteristic and confirm the expansion of crystal structure due to the presence of larger atoms (W and Zn). The catalyst with a thin Pt shell (2–3 atomic layers) could be obtained through further acid etching treatment and re-annealing (Fig. 3(a) ). Among the studied catalysts, the optimized L10-W-PtCo/C exhibits 18 times and 19.5 times higher in mass activity (MA) and specific activity (SA) than those of commercial Pt/C (Fig. 3(b)). A volcano relationship between the Pt-Pt distance (d Pt-Pt) of prepared catalysts and their ORR activity could be observed, indicating that the strain effect dominates the enhanced activity (Fig. 3(c)). In addition, when atoms with larger radii (W and Zn) are introduced, d Pt-Pt is significantly increased, indicating possible weakening of compressive strain in L10-PtCo lattices. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) and molecular mechanics calculations reveal that the average surface compression on the L10-W-PtCo NP is calculated as 2.13%, which is larger than pure Pt NP (merely 0.8%), leading to a more suitable oxygen adsorption energy to increase the ORR reaction rate (Fig. 3(d)). Due to the distinction in different crystal structures, the tetragonal L10 structure will produce anisotropic strains across different directions of the crystal lattice, which allow for the optimization of different ORR intermediates [28]. In this respect, biaxial strain can be properly introduced for the improvement of ORR activity. Through orderly alloying Zn with Pt, we synthesized the L10-PtZn/Pt-C through a self-template method [32]. EXAFS and DFT results reveal a longer d Pt-Pt (2.837 Å) and a shorter d Pt-Zn (2.667 Å) compared to the d Pt-Pt (2.775 Å) in pure Pt, indicating that A1 to L10 transition of PtZn lead to biaxial strains over Pt shell, with tension along <110> direction and compression along <101> and <011> directions. The biaxial strains in L10-PtZn/Pt pose more favorable compressive strain on Pt-skin toward high ORR activity, which are different from the strain mode of biaxial compression in other binary Pt-based intermetallic alloys since the surface is usually over compressive in these L10 structures [49,50]. Electrochemical measurements exhibit that the presence of biaxial strains plays an important role in the improvement of ORR activity, with E 1/2 dramatically increasing to 0.943 V after the phase transition from A1 to L10 (Fig. 3(g)). Meanwhile, L10-PtZn-C demonstrates an excellent mass activity (MA) of 1.02 A mgPt −1 and a specific activity (SA) of 1.68 mA cm−2 at 0.9 V (Fig. 3(h)). Even in single-cell tests, the peak power density for L10-PtZn/Pt-C in H2-O2 fuel cell test reaches as high as 2.00 W cm−2, which is superior to most of other reported PtM ORR catalysts (Fig. 3(i)). 4 ORR stability enhancement for Pt-based iNCs Considering the negative Gibbs energy change of most intermetallic Pt-based alloy during the disorder-order transition, much attention has been paid to their thermodynamic structural stability. For an intermetallic alloy with a chemical composition of A1−x B x , its formation enthalpy (per atom) with respect to the most stable structure of the pure A and B metals can be calculated by the equation as follows [51]: (4) ΔH f = ΔE f = E A1–xBx – (1 – x)E A – xE B where E A1–xBx , E A and E B are the calculated total energies of intermetallic alloy A 1–x Bx , metals A and B in the most stable structures at ground state, respectively. Since the formation enthalpy is determined by the energy difference between the final intermetallic structure and the initial metal structure, the internal bonding in the alloy/metal lattices is further considered. The bond energy difference ΔD between the intermetallic alloy and the pure metal can be given by the following equation [22]: (5) ΔD = D A–B – 1/2(D A–A + D B–B) (6) ΔHf = X A X BΔD where D A–B, D A–A and D B–B are the bond energy, X A and X B are the molar fraction. It is clear that a strong d−d orbital interaction between Pt and transition metal atom leads to a much stronger bond strength, which can greatly lower the formation enthalpy and result in a high structural stability. In this regard, Nørskov and co-workers [52] predicted that some Pt-early transition metal alloys exhibited a more negative enthalpy of formation relative to the Pt-late transition metal alloys, indicates an excellent structure stability that should prevent subsurface metal migration. However, some structural features of the actual catalysts, including size, morphology, catalyst support and etc., may not be considered by the theoretical predictions. For example, since the surface stress distribution is associated to the size of a nanoscale material which can affect the tendency of component selective segregation, it decides the stability of its ordered structures at equilibrium to a certain extent [23,53]. On the other hand, the harsh electrochemical environment often causes the violently dynamical evolution of Pt-based alloys during the catalytic process, leading to an irreversible loss of activity. It is necessary to study the stability factors of intermetallic alloys in the operating conditions of PEMFCs. Previous studies have shown that there are three main mechanisms of activity degeneration of Pt-based alloys, including the sintering driven by Ostwald ripening and agglomeration, detachment of catalyst from support, and dissolution of components [54–56]. Among them, the sintering and detachment of catalyst NPs can be partially alleviated by support design, as both of them are related to the metal-support interaction. Therefore, here we mainly focus on the corrosive dissolution of alloy systems, where it may dominate the activity loss and structure degradation. In this regard, the electrochemical stability of intermetallic alloys can be determined by the dissolution potential and with equations as followed [57,58]: (7) U diss 1 = U diss bulk + E b - E coh bulk 2 e (8) U diss all = U diss bulk + E coh - E coh bulk 2 e where and represent the dissolution potential of a single atom and all atoms, respectively. is the dissolution potential of bulk alloy, E b is the binding energy between the dissolved central atom and other atoms, E coh and are the cohesive energy of nanoparticle and bulk alloy, respectively. The physical meaning of E b here is similar to E coh, that is, the more positive the E b is, the tighter the bonds between atoms are. It indicates that the increase of dissolution potential can be achieved by an enhanced binding energy and cohesive energy, which can be tuned by atomic ordering strategy because of the enhanced bonding in intermetallic alloys. Besides, this approach is more significant for the adjustment of nano-systems, since the NPs clearly show less stability to dissolution than larger particles due to the reduced cohesive energy [59,60]. The kinetics of particle dissolution are also influenced by many factors including size [61], surface energy [62], etc. [59]. For example, the dissolution rate constant k diss of a typical Pt nanoparticle followed an electrochemical route or a chemical route can be expressed as followed [63]: (9) k diss = a diss ∞ exp ( - Δ G diss ∞ R T + 2 β γ Pt V ¯ Pt R T 1 r ) where Δ is the activation Gibbs energy of the dissolution processes at a particle of infinite size, and is the pre-exponential factor. The parameter β, is a proportionality constant. γ Pt is the surface energy and V− Pt is the molar volume of bulk Pt metal. Predictably, high surface energy is the key factor leading to a rapid dissolution of NPs. Although dissolution is difficult to avoid for catalysts at nano-scale, further surface engineering may reduce the surface energy to retard the dissolution process. Based on the comprehension of structural and electrochemical stability of intermetallic alloy, the improved catalytic stability for ORR can be ascribed to the distinctive ordering effect [14]. In this regard, the strong d−d orbital interaction in a typical intermetallic L10-PtM alloy can prevent the chemical degradation by stabilizing transition metal component [64]. We demonstrated that the sub-6 nm fully ordered L10-Pt-Ni-Co NPs enhanced ORR via Co doping [34]. The Pt-Ni-Co NPs were obtained by a self-templated method that the core/shell Pt/NiCoO x precursor could be able to facilitate the kinetics of atom diffusion and prevent NPs against sintering during annealing. Magnetic measurements indicate that the prepared L10-Pt-Ni-Co NPs exhibit a strong ferromagnetism with a Ni/Co molar radio of 0.8/0.2, which means a strong Pt(5d)-Ni/Co(3d) interaction that leading to the formation of fully ordered crystal structure (Fig. 4(a) ). Even after 5k potential cycling the C-L10-PtNi0.8Co0.2 catalyst demonstrates almost unchanged polarization curve in 0.1 mol L−1 HClO4, showing much enhanced catalytic stability against acid etching. Further characterizations display that the composition and structure of the catalyst are well retained, illustrating the excellent structural and electrochemical stability of ordered structure (Fig. 4(b)). As revealed by the previous theory, NPs with high surface energy are thermodynamically unstable and the corrosion process can be facilitated in the electrochemical environment. In this aspect, a nanoscale surface engineering method of stabilizing surface can be used to relieve the severe corrosion of ORR catalysts. In our study, by controlling tungsten doping, not only can the excessive surface strain in L10-PtCo NPs be effectively alleviated to achieve a mass activity 18 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C, but also the adjusted strain can effectively reduce the surface energy and help stabilize the structure [48]. And after the accelerated durability test (ADT), the L10-W-PtCo/C could still maintain a mass activity of 92.3%, which was much higher than the A1-PtCo/C (63.8%) and commercial Pt/C (74.1%) (Fig. 4(c)). Even in the single cell test, the L10-W-PtCo/C catalyst achieved an initial MA of 0.57 A mgPt −1 and only 17.5% MA loss after 30 000 cycles, surpassing the DOE 2020 target on both MA (0.44 A mgPt −1) and MA loss (< 40% after 30000 potential cycles) (Fig. 4(d)). More interestingly, the reduced surface energy is the result of the synergy of the strain and the ligand effect. We demonstrate that the surface energy is only reduced by about 10% with 2% compression in L10-PtCo/Pt NP relative to the case without strain, while doping of W into the L10-PtCo/Pt NP can further lower its surface energy by about 14%, rendering an even more stable surface (Fig. 4(e)). Considering the surface metal corrosion, the dissolution of atom is actually the process of breaking bonds between central atom and surrounding ones, then the metal atom can be oxidized or solvated into solution, and a vacancy will be left on the surface. The newly generated vacancy may promote the further dissolution of surrounding atoms. Therefore, the vacancy formation energy of a specific atom can be applied as a descriptor to evaluate the stability of catalysts. As mentioned above, we have prepared L10-PtZn NPs as a high-performance PEMFC cathode. L10-PtZn/Pt-C reveals an encouraging kinetic performance (0.549 A cm−2 at 0.8 V) and excellent peak power density (2.00 W cm−2), which is much improved than that of commercial Pt/C (Fig. 4(f)). Moreover, it shows extraordinary stability with an initial MA of 0.52 A mgPt −1 and only 16.6% MA loss after 30000 cycles, which surpassed the DOE 2020 targets on both MA (0.44 A mgPt −1) and MA loss (< 40% after 30000 cycles) (Fig. 4(g)). Importantly, the vacancy formation energy of Zn is increased by ~0.1 eV after structural ordering due to the reduced Zn-Zn interactions which means the strong bonding induced by structural ordering can effectively enhance the corrosion resistance of the catalyst in the electrochemical environments (Fig. 4(h)). We further calculate the vacancy formation energy (M) of L10-PtM (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn) in the L10 structures and plot the results with the corresponding structure formation energy (Fig. 4(i)). Interestingly, a negative correlation can be observed: the more negative the formation energy of L10-PtM is, the higher the vacancy formation energy of M we get, which points to the higher structural stability of L10-PtZn/Pt core/shell NCs among the others. This relationship is consistent with the inferences from equations (5) and (6) as a stronger bonding between Pt and M can lead to a more negative formation energy, and it also helps to prevent Pt and M from dissolution, resulting in a more positive vacancy formation energy. This relationship also suggests that the stability of PtM intermetallics can be enhanced by lowering the formation energy of L10-PtM alloys, which can be achieved through the introduction of a third element (e.g., early transition metals) [52,65]. Also, this result provides a feasible idea for the subsequent design of Pt-based intermetallic ORR catalysts with high activity and stability. 5 Summary and outlook Here, we provide an overview and summary of our recent studies on developing Pt-based iNCs as efficient and durable ORR catalysts for PEMFCs. The uniform and adjustable surface electronic structure of Pt-based iNCs makes them perfect model catalysts for studying structure-activity relationships and have demonstrated much enhanced ORR activity through ligand and strain effects. More importantly, L10-Pt-based iNCs exhibit intrinsically high stability due to their lower enthalpy of formation compared to the disordered counterparts. Based on the thermodynamic and kinetic understandings of disorder-order phase transition, a vacancy-induced phase transition strategy has been proposed by us and a series of L10-Pt-based iNCs ORR catalysts have been successfully prepared. While many progresses in Pt-based intermetallic electrocatalysts have been achieved over the past few decades, there still are many challenges to be addressed. Compared to the significant progress made for the random alloy nanocrystal synthetic methodology and catalytic study, the research on iNCs is still in the early stage of development. Especially, the shape construction and phase control of iNCs are still grand challenges due to the constraints imposed by the complex thermodynamic/kinetic parameters in synthesis and the unclear mechanism for the formation of complex intermetallic structures. For instance, new approaches to accelerate the phase transition kinetics for intermetallics are urgently demanded due to the agglomeration of catalysts during the high-temperature annealing. Moreover, it can be hard to obtain some theoretically predicted PtM intermetallics with unconventional structures (such as A15 or C15 structures when M = early transition metals and lanthanides) under the common conditions. Thus the methods (e.g., high temperature/pressure conditions) to synthesize novel intermetallics with different phase structures deserve further explorations. On the other hand, most studies of Pt-based iNCs focus on few structures (e.g., L10, L12, B2), the structure-activity relationships of other complex Pt-based intermetallic structures remains unclear. Thus, an in-depth understanding of universal principles is required for precisely tuning the microstructure of intermetallics to enhance ORR and other catalytical reactions. Moreover, a unified theory describing the stability of Pt-based intermetallic catalysts need to be established for the meaningful comparisons to be made across different reports and the rapid development of long-term durable intermetallic catalysts. More practically, due to the divergence of test conditions (e.g., temperature, interface structure.) between half-cell and single-cell, the actual expressions of catalytic performance may show significant differences. Therefore, the factors contributing to activity and the degradation mechanism of catalysts in the fuel cell need to be further explored, and some in situ/operando characterizations and computational simulations may play critical roles in this regard.

        "dc:description": "Developing high-performance Pt-M (M = transition metal) intermetallic alloy catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are key to achieving large-scale applications of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). It is urgent to clarify the general rules to design and prepare intermetallic Pt-M catalysts with high ORR activity and stability. In this account, the basic principles for disorder-order phase transition in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics are first introduced and our recent efforts in synthesizing fully-ordered Pt-M intermetallic nanocrystals (iNCs) with well-defined L10-ordering structures are described. Then the effective strategies for further enhancing the activity and stability of L10-Pt-M ORR catalysts for PEMFCs are exemplified. We hope that this account will provide some significant insights into the research and development of intermetallic Pt-M alloy ORR catalysts for the applications of PEMFCs and other electrochemical energy conversion technologies in the future.",
