Box 74715-117 Firoozabad, Fars, Iran Abstract: 1,3,5-Tris(hydrogensulfato) benzene (THSB) was easily prepared by the reaction between phloroglucinol and chlorosulfonic acid in dichloromethane at room temperature. This compound was then used as an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of 4,4'-(arylmethylene)bis(1H-pyrazol-5-ols) through the condensation reactions of 1-phenyl-3-methylpyrazol-5-one with several different aromatic aldehydes in ethanol at 75 Â°C. The present methodology offers several advantages over existing methodologies, such as excellent yields, simple procedure, easy work-up and ecofriendly reaction conditions. Key words: 1,3,5-tris(hydrogensulfato) benzene; aromatic aldehydes; 1-phenyl-3-methylpyrazol-5-one; 4,4'-(arylmethylene)bis (1H-pyrazol-5-ols); ethanol; multicomponent reaction Heterocycles represent the largest of the classical divisions in organic chemistry by far and are of immense importance both biologically and industrially. Pyrazoles are an important class of heterocyclic compound. Examination of the chemical literature reveals that a great many synthetic pyrazole deriva- tives have been reported, with applications across a wide range of fields, where they have been used as pharmaceuticals, ag- rochemicals, and photographic agents. 2,4-Dihydro-3H- pyrazol-3-one derivatives, including the 4,4'-(arylmethylene) bis(1H-pyrazol-5-ols) have a broad spectrum of approved biological activity, and have been used as anti-inflammatory [1], antipyretic [2], gastric secretion stimulatory [3], antide- pressant [4], antibacterial [5], antiviral [6], and antifilarial agents [7]. They have also used as fungicides [8], insecticides [9], and dyestuffs [10ï€­13]. Over the years, multicomponent reactions [14ï€­16] (MCRs) have become increasingly popular as tools for enabling the introduction of sufficient molecular diversity and complexity. These reactions have gained significant popularity in recent years because of their atom-economy and straightforward reaction design, which also allows for substantial minimization in the levels of waste generated from the process with consid- erable saving in labor, time, and costs [17ï€­19]. MCRs leading to the generation of interesting heterocyclic scaffolds are par- ticularly useful for the construction of diverse chemical li- braries of â€˜drug likeâ€™ molecules. Recently, several different three component one-pot con- densation reactions have been reported between 1-phenyl-3-methylpyrazol-5-one and a variety of different aldehydes for the construction of 4,4'-(arylmethylene)bis (1H-pyrazol-5-ol) derivatives [6, 20ï€­32]. Several different catalysts have been reported to promote this reaction, including ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) [6], sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as a surfactant catalyst [20], ETBA [21], NaBr [22], [Cu(3,4-tmtppa)](MeSO 4 ) 4 [23], silica-bonded S-sulfonic acid (SBSSA) [24], silica sulfuric acid (SSA) [25], H 2 O [26], sul- furic acid ([3-(3-silicapropyl)sulfanyl] propyl)ester (SASPSPE) [27], xanthan sulfuric acid [28], PEG-SO3H [29], ionic liquid [HMIM]HSO4 [30], 3-minopropylated silica gel (AP-SiO2) [31], and phosphomolybdic acid [32]. Although some of these methods afford moderate to high yields of the corresponding products, the majority suffer from one or more of the following disadvantages, including (1) the use of a costly catalyst; (2) the requirement for a tedious work-up procedure; (3) the need for high temperatures; and (4) long reaction times. Herein, we report the development of a Zahed KARIMI-JABERI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1945â€“1949 mild, efficient, and environmentally benign procedure for the synthesis of 4,4'-(arylmethylene)bis(1H-pyrazol-5-ol) deri- vates from the condensation reaction of aldehydes and 1-phenyl-3-methylpyrazol-5-one in the presence of 1,3,5-tris(hydrogensulfato) benzene (THSB) as an efficient and new catalyst. 1 Experimental 1.1 General All of the chemicals were purchased from Merck and Al- drich. Melting points were determined in open capillary tubes and are uncorrected. IR measurements were carried out using KBr pellets on a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spec- trometer (Manufacturer, City, State/Country). 1 H (250 MHz) and 13 C (62.5 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 250 spectrometer (Bruker, City, State/Country) in DMSO-d 6 using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal refer- ence. All of the products have been reported previously in the literature and were characterized according to their spectral and physical data. Reaction monitoring for the progress of all of the reactions was carried out by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using silica gel 60 GF 245 precoated sheets and were visualized using a UV-lamp at a wave length of 254 nm. All chemicals and solvents were of reagent grade and the latter were distilled and dried before use. The elemental analyses were performed with an Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH VarioEL in CHNS mode. 1.2 Preparation of THSB A solution of chlorosulfonic acid (8.74 g, ca. 5 ml, 75 mmol) in CH 2 Cl 2 (20 ml) was added to phloroglucinol (3.15 g, 25 mmol) in a drop-wise manner over a period of 1 h at room temperature (Scheme 1). HCl evolved immediately. Upon completion of the addition, the mixture was shaken for 3 h, and the residual HCl was removed by suction. The solid residue was washed with n-hexane (10 ml) and filtered to give the desired product as a yellow solid material in 95% yield. 1.3 General procedure for the one-pot synthesis of 4,4'-(arylmethylene)bis(1H-pyrazol-5-ol) derivatives THSB (0.04 mmol, 0.014 g) and silica gel (0.006 g) were added to a solution of aromatic aldehyde 1 (1 mmol, Scheme 2) and 1-phenyl-3-methylpyrazol-5-one 2 (2 mmol, scheme 2) in ethanol (2 ml), and the resulting mixture was stirred at 75 Â°C for the specified period of time, as indicated in Table 1. Upon completion of the reaction, as confirmed by TLC, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. The resulting pre- cipitated product was then filtered and washed with n-hexane (10 ml) to afford the pure product 3 (3aâ€“3u) as a white powder. 1.4 Characterization of some representative compounds THSB.

This reaction proceeded smoothly and cleanly, with HCl gas being immedi- ately evolved from the reaction mixture. Furthermore, the catalyst itself was safe and easy to handle (Scheme 1). In connection with our ongoing work towards the devel- opment of new synthetic routes for the construction of complex heterocyclic compounds, such as the newly discovered 2-amino-4H-pyran-3-carbonitriles [33], 2,3-dihydro quina- zolin-4(1H)-ones [34], tetrahydrobenzo[a]xanthen-11-ones [35], and dihydropyrano[2,3-c]pyrazoles [36], herein we report the three-component condensation reaction of aromatic alde- hydes 1 with 1-phenyl-3-methylpyrazol-5-one 2 in ethanol in the presence of THSB as a novel catalyst with a reaction time of 2â€“5 min, allowing for the one-pot formation of 4,4'-(arylmethylene)bis(1H-pyrazol-5-ols) 3 in excellent yields (Scheme 2). For the initial optimization of the reaction conditions, the condensation reaction of 4-chlorobenzaldehyde with 1-phenyl-3-methylpyrazol-5-one was investigated in ethanol as a model reaction. The best result was achieved when 4-chlorobenzaldehyde was reacted with 1-phenyl-3- methylpyrazol-5-one (in a 1:2 molar ratio) in the presence of THSB (X wt%) at 75 Â°C for 2 min (Table 1, entry 2). These conditions were therefore selected as the optimized conditions and employed for the condensation reaction of a variety of different aryl aldehydes with 3-methyl-l-phenyl-5- pyrazolone to give the corresponding 4,4'-(arylmethylene) bis(3-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-ol) derivatives. The re- sults are summarized in Table 1.

Zahed KARIMI-JABERI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1945â€“1949 As shown in Table 1, all of the aromatic aldehydes 1 reacted successfully with 1-phenyl-3-methylpyrazol-5-one 2 in the presence of THSB in ethanol at 75 Â°C, to afford the corre- sponding products 3 in excellent yields. Aromatic aldehydes containing electron-withdrawing (e.g., nitro and halide groups) and electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl and alkoxy groups) were employed and reacted well to give the corre- sponding products 3 in excellent yields under these reaction conditions, leading to the conclusion that the electronic nature of the substituents on the aromatic ring had no discernible impact on the course of the reaction. The practicality and synthetic efficiency of this reaction was highlighted by the reaction of terephthaldehyde with 1-phenyl-3-methylpyrazol-5-one to give structurally complex di(bis-pyrazol-5-ol) Table 1 [25,27]. To highlight the advantages of the THSB catalyst over the other catalysts reported in the literature, the results obtained using this catalyst were compared with those obtained from other catalysts for the synthesis of 4,4'-(arylmethylene) bis(1H-pyrazol-5-ols). From Table 2, it is clear that THSB appeared to promote the reaction more effectively than a number of other catalysts, particularly in terms of the time required to complete the reaction and the reaction yield. This method offers some advantages in terms of very fast reaction times, simplicity of performance, low cost, and it follows along the line of green chemistry. 3 Conclusions In conclusion, we have described the development of an ef- ficient one-pot three-component condensation reaction of aromatic aldehydes with 1-phenyl-3-methylpyrazol-5-one in ethanol for the synthesis of 4,4'-(arylmethylene)bis(1H-pyrazol-5-ol) derivatives, with the process being catalyzed by 1,3,5-tris(hydrogensulfato) benzene (THSB) as a novel catalyst. This new method has the advan- tages of higher yields, mild reaction conditions, shorter reac- tion times, and is a convenient and environmental friendly procedure. We are currently exploring further applications of the THSB catalyst to other organic reactions in our laboratory.
