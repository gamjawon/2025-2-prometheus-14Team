Graphical abstract Silica SBA-15 without removal of template P123 was calcined in an inert atmosphere and the carbon-modified SBA-15 thus obtained was used as the support of Pd catalyst for the hydrogenation of 2-ethylanthraquinone (EAQ). The effects of extraction times of P123 in SBA-15 with water prior to inert calcination and calcination temperature on the structure and catalytic performance of Pd catalyst were studied. The results of elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectra, water contact angle measurement, N2 adsorption-desorption, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray mapping showed that carbon content of catalysts varied in the range of 3.4 % and 1.1 % with increasing extraction times from 0 to 6 due to the decrease in the residual amount of P123 in uncalcined SBA-15. With rising calcination temperature, the occurrence state of carbon in catalysts was converted from amorphism into graphite. The Pd catalyst supported on SBA-15 extracted for 3 times and calcined at 650 °C had 2.0 % carbon, and exhibited the highest activity (0.37 molH2·gPd−1·min−1) and selectivity (98.9 %). This is due to the presence of appropriate amount of carbon, which provided a relatively high hydrophobicity without significantly reducing the specific surface area and pore size of SBA-15 support. The high hydrophobicity benefits the adsorption of EAQ from the working solution to the surface of catalyst.

It has diversified applications and moved an industry of 6 billion dollars projected to be reached by 2023 [1–4]. H2O2 is produced industrially through sequential hydrogenation of 2-alkylanthraquinone (typically 2-ethylanthraquinone, EAQ) dissolved in a mixed organic solvent, oxidation of formed anthrahydroquinone and extraction of H2O2, named as the anthraquinone process [5]. Since the working solution requires a long period of run, degradation products formed in the hydrogenation step, such as 2-ethyloctahydroanthraquinone, 2-ethylanthrone and 2-ethyloxanthrone, are easy to be accumulated in the working solution. This would cause the change in physical properties (density, viscosity and interfacial tension, etc.) of the working solution, which is unfavorable to the operations, especially to the phase separation at the extraction step [6,7]. To avoid this issue, the conversion of EAQ is usually controlled below 60 %–70 %, which limits the production capacity [8,9]. Pd-based catalytically active phase, including mono-metallic Pd [10,11], bimetallic Pd-M (M = Ir, Ru, Au, Ag, Co, Cu, Ni) [12–16] and phosphorus-modified Pd [17], and a wide variety of supports including activated carbon, Al2O3, SiO2, SBA-15 and polymer [18–23] are used for the catalysts of 2-alkylanthraquinone (AQ) hydrogenation. It is recognized that increase in the surface area and pore size and decrease in the pore length of catalyst favor the hydrogenation rate because of bulky reactant molecular volume of AQ [24]. An increase in acidity of catalyst could accelerate the hydrogenation rate of EAQ because acid sites can act as the adsorption sites for EAQ molecules. But, it leads to the increased formation of degradation products [25–27]. The incorporation of basic sites into catalyst could inhibit the formation of degradation products, being attributed to the improvement of electron density and dispersion of Pd particles [28–31]. Another factor affecting the rate and selectivity of hydrogenation is the hydrophobicity of catalysts. Suitable tailor-made functional resin supported Pd catalyst had higher selectivity of EAQ hydrogenation than commercial catalyst [32]. High activity and selectivity were observed on Pd nanoparticles embedded inside gel-type functional resins [33]. Pd catalyst supported on polyaniline-coated SiO2 exhibited higher reactivity and inhibited degradation reactions compared with that on uncoated SiO2 [21]. In our previous work, functionalized SBA-15 with organosilane was prepared by the post-grafting and co-condensation method, respectively. Catalytic performance of Pd catalysts supported on functionalized SBA-15 in 2-alkylanthraquinone (alkyl = ethyl, tert-butyl and amyl) hydrogenation was improved significantly compared with that on unfunctionalized SBA-15 [23,34]. Motivated by the potential, in this work, hydrophobically functionalized SBA-15 was prepared by a facile inert atmosphere calcination, during which template P123 in SBA-15 could be convert into carbon. The as-synthesized SBA-15 was served as the support for Pd catalyst of EAQ hydrogenation. The effects of extraction times of P123 in SBA-15 prior to calcination and calcination temperature on carbon content, hydrophobicity and catalytic performance of Pd catalyst were studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of catalysts Firstly, hydrophobically modified SBA-15 was synthesized. 2.4 g triblock copolymer (Pluronic P123, Sigma-Aldrich, Mw = 5800) was dissolved in 90 mL 1.3 M HCl (GR, Tianjin Real Lead Chemical Co., Ltd., China) at 40 °C, followed by the slow addition of 4.25 g tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 98 %, Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Corporation, China). After agitation for 24 h, the mixture was transferred to a stainless steel reactor with Teflon lining and maintained at 100 °C for 48 h. The resulting mixture was poured into a Buchner funnel equipped with medium speed filter paper and filtered using a vacuum pump. The solid was rinsed several times with 400 mL distilled water for each time. Then, the product was dried at 110 °C overnight and calcined in argon atmosphere at a desired temperature for 6 h with a heating rate of 1 °C·min−1. These supports are denoted as SC-X-Y, where X represents the number of washing times (X = 0, 3, 6) and Y represents calcination temperature (550, 650 and 750 °C). An unmodified SBA-15 was obtained by a conventional post-treatment procedure which involves filtration, thorough washing with distilled water, drying at 110 °C overnight and calcination at 550 °C in air for 6 h with a heating rate of 1 °C·min−1. This support is denoted as S-UN. Then, Pd was loaded by incipient-wetness impregnation method with a content of 1 wt%. 0.05 g Pd(NH3)4Cl2·H2O (99.9 %, Tianjin Heowns Biochem LLC, China) was dissolved in 8 mL NH3·H2O (AR, Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute, China) with a pH value of 10, mixed with 2 g dried support and stirred vigorously. After impregnating for 2 h, the sample was dried at 110 °C overnight, calcined at 500 °C in argon atmosphere for 4 h, and finally reduced at 250 °C in 10%H2/90%Ar for 2 h. The resulting catalysts are denoted as Pd/SC-X-Y (X = 0, 3, 6; Y = 550, 650, 750) and Pd/S-UN. 2.2 Characterization CHN elemental analysis was carried out on an Elementar Vario EL elemental analyzer (CHN ≤ 0.1%). All samples were vacuum dried at 110 °C for 6 h prior to analysis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku D/MAX-2500 diffractometer, operating at 40 kV, 200 mA with Cu-Ka radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). Small angle XRD patterns were recorded in the 2θ range of 0.5−3° with a scanning speed of 0.5°/min. Wide angle XRD patterns were recorded in the 2θ range of 10−60° with a scanning speed of 8°/min. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi photoelectron spectrometer using an Al Ka (hν = 1486.6 eV) radiation source. Pd content was determined using a Perkin Elmer Optima 5300DV inductively coupled plasma. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Vertex 70 Infrared Spectrophotometer with a resolution of 4 cm−1 in the range of 400−4000 cm−1, 10 mg sample containing catalyst and KBr in a mass ratio of 1:50 was used for tableting. Raman spectra were obtained on a Thermo Scientific DXR Microscope spectrometer, a 532 nm radiation from argon ion laser was used as excitation source. Water contact angles were measured on a Data Physics OCA15EC Drop Shape Analyzer. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 physical adsorption instrument. Catalysts were pre-treated in N2 flow at 300 °C for 4 h prior to the measurement. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning TEM (STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping analysis was carried out on a JEOL JEM-2100 F transmission electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. 2.3 Hydrogenation test 2-Ethylanthraquinone (EAQ, ≥99.0 %, Wuhan Fude Chemical Co., Ltd., China) was dissolved in a mixed solvent (volume ratio of 1:1) of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB, 97 %, Aladdin Industrial Corporation, China) and trioctyl phosphate (TOP, 98 %, TCI Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Japan), yielding the working solution with a concentration of 0.38 mol·L−1. 0.15 g catalyst and 30 mL working solution were added to a batch reactor. The reaction was carried out under 0.3 MPa H2 and 60 °C with a stirring speed of 600 rpm. A mass flowmeter was used to record H2 consumption. After finishing hydrogenation and stewing for 20 min, 3 mL hydrogenated working solution was sampled through a 0.22 μm microfiltration membrane. The sample was oxidized with oxygen (1.5 mL·min−1) at room temperature and atmospheric pressure for 20 min and H2O2 was extracted with 30 mL deionized water. The extraction procedure was repeated four times. The raffinate phase was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Bruker 456-GC with DB-17 column and FID detector). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Elemental analysis As seen in Table 1 , the carbon content of Pd catalysts on SBA-15 calcined in Ar decreases with the increase in washing times of SBA-15 supports prior to calcination (from 3.4 % down to 1.1 %), but it keeps approximately constant (2 %–2.1 %) at different calcination temperatures. During washing, P123 in SBA-15 was extracted with water, resulting in the decrease in the residual amount of P123. That is, the change in the amount of carbon source leads to the different carbon contents in catalysts. 3.2 XRD and XPS analysis The small angle and wide angle XRD patterns of catalysts are presented in Fig. 1 and the values of interplanar spacing (d100) are listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), all catalysts exhibit three obvious characteristic peaks at 2θ = 0.9°, 1.4° and 1.7° referred to the (100), (110) and (200) planes of SBA-15, indicating a p6mm mesopore structure of SBA-15 [35]. d100 reduces with rising calcination temperature from 550 °C to 750 °C at approximate carbon content (Table 1) because of the shrinkage of SBA-15 structure caused by high temperature. At the same calcination temperature, the catalyst with high carbon content has high d100. For example, d100 of Pd/SC-3-550 (9.8 nm) is higher than that of Pd/S-UN (9.5 nm), and d100 of Pd/CS-0-650 (9.5 nm) is higher than that of Pd/CS-6-650 (9.3 nm). This indicates that carbon formed inside pore channels of SBA-15 by carbonization of P123 could prevent the shrinkage of silica framework. As shown in Fig. 1(b), all catalysts exhibit a broad and strong diffraction peak in the range of 2θ = 15−30° indexed as characteristics of amorphous silica [36]. Zhang et al. proposed that transformation of P123 molecule to graphitized carbon may occur during high temperature calcination [37]. However, no carbon signals that could be attributed to amorphous carbon (at 2θ = 10−35° [38]) or graphite (at 2θ = 21.8° [39]) are observed. It might be because of the broad and strong SiO2 peak which covers other peaks in this range. Besides, there are two weak peaks at 2θ = 40.1° and 46.5° assigned to (111) and (200) planes of palladium lattice. This indicates the presence of Pd0 species in catalysts, which is supported by XPS results shown in Fig. 2 . Two peaks at 341.4 eV and 336.1 eV are assigned to Pd0 3d3/2 and Pd0 3d5/2, confirming Pd in catalysts is in reduced state [40]. According to ICP measurement, all catalysts exhibit approximate Pd loading of 1 ± 0.02 wt%, which is in consistent with theoretical value (1 wt%). 3.3 FTIR and Raman measurement The FTIR spectra of catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . All catalysts show adsorption bands at 465 cm−1, 800 cm−1, 950 cm−1 and 1100 cm−1 corresponding to the OSiO deformation, SiO4 tetrahedron ring, SiOH stretching and Si-O-Si asymmetrical stretching, which are typical for SBA-15 [41]. Bands at 1600 cm−1 and 3400 cm−1 could be attributed to bending vibrations and stretching of physically adsorbed water [42], and those at 2850 cm−1 and 2920 cm−1 could be attributed to the stretching vibration of CH2 and CH3 [43]. For Pd/SUN, there are no discernable bands of CH stretching vibration being observed. For all the carbon-modified catalysts, the bands of CH stretching vibration are clearly visible, with an intensity order of Pd/SC-6-650 ≈ Pd/SC-3-750 < Pd/SC-3-650 < Pd/SC-3-550 < Pd/SC-0-650. This may be ascribed to incomplete carbonization of P123 inside the pore channels of SBA-15. Especially, at respectively low calcination temperature and washing times, more P123 tends to remain in the incompletely carbonized form [44]. Further analysis of Pd/SC-3-550 and Pd/SC-3-750 was performed by Raman spectra (not shown here). However, there are no characteristic bands assigned to carbon were detected due to the strong fluorescence of SBA-15 that covers Raman signals of carbon [45]. In order to determine the occurrence state of carbon in SBA-15, samples prepared by calcining pure P123 in argon atmosphere at 550 °C (P123-550) and 750 °C (P123-750) were characterized by FTIR and Raman spectra, and the results are depicted in Fig. 4 (a) and (b). Both P123-550 and P123-750 have two bands of adsorbed water at 3400 cm−1 and 1600 cm−1 in FTIR spectra and no CH bands are observed, indicating that P123 existed in freedom form can be completely converted to carbon after calcination at 550 °C. In Raman spectra, two bands at 1350 cm−1 and 1590 cm−1 observed in both samples are corresponding to the disordered carbon (D band) and ordered graphitic structure (G band) [46]. The relative intensity of the G and D bands (IG/ID) increased from 1.19 to 1.39 as calcination temperature increased from 550 °C to 750 °C. This implies that both amorphous carbon and graphitized carbon existed in the calcinated samples of pure P123, regardless of the calcination temperature at 550 and 750 °C. Therefore, it can be speculated that carbon component in carbon-modified catalysts has three occurrence states, incompletely carbonized hydrocarbon fragments, amorphous carbon and graphitized carbon. The ratio of three carbon states varies with the calcination temperature. SBA-15 calcinated at 550 °C in argon has the lowest content of graphitized carbon. 3.4 Water contact angle measurement Fig. 5 displays the relationship between water contact angle and carbon content of catalysts. It is found that water contact angles do not monotonously vary with the carbon content. Water contact angles of all modified catalysts are higher than that of conventionally synthesized Pd/S-UN because of the incorporation of carbon. Pd/SC-0-650 has maximum water contact angle of 52°, rendering the highest hydrophobicity. Pd/SC-3-650 and Pd/SC-3-750 with the same carbon content have the same water contact angle of 33°. Pd/SC-3-550 has the slightly higher carbon content than Pd/SC-3-650 and Pd/SC-3-750, but slightly smaller water contact angle (31°). Similarly, the carbon content of Pd/SC-6-650 (1.1 %) is much lower than that of Pd/SC-3-550 (2.1 %), but the difference in water contact angle between them is only 4°. There are three main parameters affecting water contact angles in this work and they are the content and occurrence state of carbon and surface roughness. Incompletely carbonized hydrocarbon fragments have lower contribution to hydrophobicity than amorphous and graphitized carbon [34]. This is the main reason for lower water contact angle of Pd/SC-3-550. Another parameter affecting water contact angles is the surface roughness. Pd/SC-3-750 has higher content of amorphous and graphitized carbon than Pd/SC-3-650, together with the same carbon content as Pd/SC-3-650. However, their water contact angles are the same. This might be ascribed to the slightly lower surface roughness of Pd/SC-3-750 than Pd/SC-3-650 (pore size: 6.9 nm vs. 7.2 nm), resulting in the diminished water contact angle [47,48]. 3.5 N2 adsorption-desorption In Fig. 6 (a), the adsorption-desorption isotherms of all catalysts are type IV curves with narrow H1 hysteresis loops at the relative pressure of 0.60-0.80, indicative of the presence of uniform tubular mesopores [49,50]. In Fig. 6(b), all catalysts display uniform pore size centered on around 7 nm. As seen in Table 1, the specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameter of carbon-modified catalysts decrease slightly with increasing the calcination temperature and carbon content. Among them, Pd/SC-3-750 and Pd/SC-0-650 give the maximum decline due to the highest calcination temperature and largest carbon content. The pore wall thickness shows decreased trend with increasing calcination temperature, but opposite with increasing carbon content. Pd/SC-3-550 and Pd/SC-0-650 have significantly higher values than other catalysts because of more carbon existing in the form of incompletely carbonized hydrocarbon fragments. This is in accordance with the results of FTIR spectra. Among catalysts having relatively high hydrophobicity (water contact angle > 30°), Pd/SC-3-650 exhibits minimally reduced specific surface area and pore diameter, and minimally increased pore wall thickness. This is attributed to the appropriate extraction times and calcination temperature, which preserves sufficient carbon source and high conversion of P123 into carbon. 3.6 Transmission electron microscopy The TEM images of catalysts and size distributions of Pd particles are presented in Fig. 7 (a)–(f), STEM images of Pd/S-UN and Pd/SC-3-650 and the corresponding EDX mappings of Pd are presented in Fig. 7(g)–(j). All catalysts show ordered mesoporous structure and highly dispersed Pd particles, which is consistent with the results of XRD and N2 adsorption-desorption. As shown in Table 1, the average size of Pd particles in Pd/S-UN (4.7 nm) is slightly higher than those in modified catalysts (4.0–4.5 nm). Since an aqueous solution containing Pd source was used for the impregnation of Pd on supports, the hydrophilic surface benefits the dispersion of Pd particles. However, Zhu et al. proposed that carbon existed on the surface of SBA-15 could prevent metal particles from agglomerating during calcination [51]. Thus, the size of Pd particles for all catalysts lies within a relatively narrow range, with a maximum variation of 0.7 nm. As shown in STEM and EDX mapping images, Pd particles are more uniformly dispersed on Pd/SC-3-650 than Pd/S-UN. 3.7 EAQ hydrogenation The amount of H2 consumption (AHC, 10−3mol) for EAQ hydrogenation over various catalysts and the selectivity to target product (2-ethylanthrahydroquinone, EAQH2), active anthraquinone (2-ethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroanthraquinone, H4EAQ) and degradation products (2-ethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroanthraquinone, iso-H4EAQ and 2-ethylanthrone, EAN) at EAQ conversion of 100 % are shown in Fig. 8 . The initial H2 consumption rate (r0, molH2·gPd-1·min-1) calculated according to the linear region of AHC curves is listed in Table 1. It can be seen from Fig. 8(a) and Table 1 that all carbon-modified catalysts give higher initial H2 consumption rate than unmodified one. Among them, Pd/SC-3-650 exhibits the highest initial H2 consumption rate reached up to 0.37 molH2·gPd−1 min−1, which increases by 185 % compared with that of unmodified Pd/S-UN (0.13 molH2·gPd−1 min−1). The increase in the hydrogenation rate of carbon-modified catalysts can be attributed to the hydrophobic surface, which is conducive to the adsorption of EAQ from the working solution [32]. Although Pd/SC-0-650 has the highest water contact angle, its smallest pore size (6.8 nm) limits the diffusion of EAQ inside pore channels of catalyst. A similar phenomenon is occurred on Pd/SC-3-750. It has the same water contact angle as Pd/SC-3-650 (33°), but lower r0 than the latter because of the smaller pore size (6.9 nm). However, a careful comparison found that Pd/SC-0-650 exhibits slightly smaller pore size but much lower r0 than Pd/SC-3-750. Since Pd/SC-0-650 has the highest carbon content, there is more carbon remained as hydrocarbon fragments in it. It might lead to the obviously reduced exposure of active sites because of partial coverage of Pd particles. As a result, the utilization of Pd decreases. Another perverse phenomenon is that Pd/SC-3-550 has the same pore size as Pd/SC-6-650 and the slightly higher water contact angles than the latter (31° vs 27°). But, the hydrogenation rate of Pd/SC-3-550 is slower than that of Pd/SC-6-650. This might be ascribed to the low calcination temperature, which leads to less transformation of P123 to graphite carbon. Zhi et al. reported that graphitized carbon could interact with aromatic compounds to conduct π-π effect, accelerating the reaction through specific adsorption of reactant molecules [52]. As shown in Fig. 8(b), there is a small difference in the selectivity to EAQH2 among catalysts. All carbon-modified catalysts possess the higher selectivity to EAQH2 than unmodified one. In comparison, the selectivity over Pd/SC-3-650 is the highest, which reaches 98.9 %. Ma et al., Wang et al., Hong et al. and Wang et al. found that the hydrophobic surface and large size of pore channels could facilitate the desorption and diffusion of EAQH2 from active sites to the external surface of catalyst, preventing the deep hydrogenation [23,24,34,53]. These two benefits are combined on Pd/SC-3-650, resulting in the relatively high selectivity. Although both Pd/SC-3-750 and Pd/SC-0-650 have markedly improved hydrophobicity, the smaller pore size limits the in-pore diffusion of product molecules, leading to relatively serious deep hydrogenation [53]. In this work, H4EAQ, iso-H4EAQ and EAN were detected as by-products. H4EAQ and EAN were found to be predominant. Moreover, the difference in the distribution of by-products among catalysts is also small because the total selectivity of by-products is extremely low. 4 Conclusions Carbon-modified SBA-15 was synthesized by calcining P123 in SBA-15 in inert atmosphere and applied as support of Pd catalyst for the hydrogenation of 2-ethylanthraquinone. The content of carbon could be affected by the extraction times of P123 with water prior calcination and the occurrence state of carbon could be affected by calcination temperature. The catalyst supported on carbon-modified SBA-15 obtained by extracting three times and calcining at 650 °C (Pd/SC-3-650) has relatively high hydrophobicity, without significant decrease in the pore size. As a result, it exhibited both high hydrogenation rate and selectivity to EAQH2. Values of 0.37 molH2·gPd−1·min−1 and 98.9 % at 100 % conversion of EAQ respectively were achieved over it.

        "dc:description": "Silica SBA-15 without removal of template P123 was calcined in an inert atmosphere and the carbon-modified SBA-15 thus obtained was used as the support of Pd catalyst for the hydrogenation of 2-ethylanthraquinone (EAQ). The effects of extraction times of P123 in SBA-15 with water prior to inert calcination and calcination temperature on the structure and catalytic performance of Pd catalyst were studied. The results of elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectra, water contact angle measurement, N2 adsorption-desorption, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray mapping showed that carbon content of catalysts varied in the range of 3.4 % and 1.1 % with increasing extraction times from 0 to 6 due to the decrease in the residual amount of P123 in uncalcined SBA-15. With rising calcination temperature, the occurrence state of carbon in catalysts was converted from amorphism into graphite. The Pd catalyst supported on SBA-15 extracted for 3 times and calcined at 650 °C had 2.0 % carbon, and exhibited the highest activity (0.37 molH2·gPd−1·min−1) and selectivity (98.9 %). This is due to the presence of appropriate amount of carbon, which provided a relatively high hydrophobicity without significantly reducing the specific surface area and pore size of SBA-15 support. The high hydrophobicity benefits the adsorption of EAQ from the working solution to the surface of catalyst.",
