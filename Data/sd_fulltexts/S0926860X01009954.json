Tel.: +82-31-2907244; fax: +82-31-2907272 It was found that nickel-added strontium phosphate exhibited high activity and selectivity in partial oxidation of methane. The optimum nickel content could be determined. Over the optimum catalyst, methane conversions and H2 and CO concentrations in excess of those predicted by the thermodynamic equilibrium were observed. It is believed that the catalytically active species is metallic nickel. This metallic nickel is considered to come from nickel-substituted strontium phosphate under reducing environment, giving highly dispersed nickel metal particles. Keywords Nickel Partial oxidation of methane Strontium phosphate Syngas 1 Introduction Catalytic partial oxidation of methane (POM) for synthesis gas production has been an active subject in recent years. The process arouses renewed interest as a promising alternative to the steam reforming of methane [1–11]. Although the steam reforming of methane is the dominant commercialized process for syngas production, it has some drawbacks relating to the energy and capital costs since it is a highly endothermic reaction and is operated under high pressure. In addition, the water-gas shift reaction produces significant quantities of carbon dioxide. Compared with the steam reforming, POM is mildly exothermic and does not require high operating pressures and hence is more energy efficient. The reaction can be carried out with lower investment and will produce a smaller amount of CO2. Recently, POM is of particular interest in fuel processing applications such as in fuel cells for start-up from cold, owing to its exothermic nature [3,8]. There have been numerous studies on POM over various metal catalysts. Ni and noble metals such as Rh, Pt and Pd are reported to be active metals for POM and these are usually dispersed on various oxide supports. Ni is the most extensively studied catalyst because it is effective as well as cheap. Ni is usually supported on alumina and silica, but it is susceptible to the formation of inactive nickel aluminate and silicate. Sintering and coke formation are other problems. Several attempts have been reported to overcome these problems. Choudhary et al. [6] have recently shown that, in supported Ni catalysts prepared by depositing NiO on alumina and silica precoated with MgO, chemical interactions of NiO with the support can be prevented by providing a stable protective layer of magnesium aluminate and silicate. They also showed that MgO stabilizes nickel on the support surface against sintering by forming a NiO–MgO solid solution. Liu et al. [11] have reported that when Li and La are added to alumina-supported Ni, they improve the stability of the support and suppress the sintering and loss of Ni, in addition to enhancing the ability to resist carbon deposition. Hayakawa et al. [9] and Takehira et al. [10] have reported that Ni supported on perovskite-type oxides prepared by the solid phase crystallization, such as Ni0.2/ATiO3 (A: Ca, Sr or Ba), shows good activity and selectivity as well as very low coke formation. They explain that this may be due to highly dispersed and stable Ni metal particles on the perovskite, where the nickel species thermally evolve during the reaction from the cations homogeneously distributed in an inert perovskite matrix as the precursor. Such studies suggest that high dispersion of metal species and/or use of alkaline earth metals may be beneficial to improve the catalytic performance for the POM. In this work, another type of new catalyst, nickel-added strontium phosphate, was investigated for POM. No refractory oxide support was used in this catalyst. This catalyst had been found in our laboratory during research on oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), in which transition metal-substituted strontium hydroxyapatite catalysts were investigated [12]. While Pb-substituted strontium hydroxyapatite was a good catalyst for the OCM, a Ni-added catalyst showed good activity and selectivity for the POM and had a different crystalline structure. To find the optimum composition, the composition of the catalyst was varied and the catalytic performance was tested. The optimum catalyst showed excellent performance with respect to the activity and selectivity. The active species of the catalyst was discussed. 2 Experimental The catalysts were prepared from nearly saturated aqueous solutions of strontium nitrate, nickel nitrate and dibasic ammonium phosphate. Predetermined amounts of the solutions were mixed with vigorous stirring. The mixture was dried at 383K overnight and then heat-treated in air at 1073K for 2h to obtain the catalyst. The mole ratio of (Sr+Ni)/P employed was fixed at 10/6 and the Ni/(Sr+Ni) mole ratio was varied from 0.01 to 0.2. The catalysts were designated to be SrNiA(a), a being 100×Ni/(Sr+Ni), mol% of Ni out of (Sr+Ni). The catalysts were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Ni-filtered Cu Kα (M18xHF-SRA, Mao Science), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Stereoscan 440, Leica Cambridge), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using Al Kα radiation with the reference of Au 4f7/2 at 84.00eV (VG Escalab Mark II). The catalyst performance was tested by a conventional method using an 8mm i.d. quartz-tube flow reactor. The reaction temperature was measured by a thermocouple directly contacting the catalyst particles and controlled by an electric furnace. Unless specified otherwise, the following experimental conditions were employed. The catalyst charge was 1.0g. The partial pressures of methane and oxygen were 0.16 and 0.08atm, respectively. Ar was used as the diluent gas and the total flow rate was 100cm3 (NTP)/min. The product gas was analyzed by two gas chromatographs using Carboxen 1004 columns (Supelco); one used Ar as the carrier gas and the other used He. The latter was needed especially when the concentration of CO2 produced was too low to detect by using the Ar carrier gas. The CO selectivity is defined here as (moles of CO produced)/(moles of CH4 consumed). The CO2 selectivity is defined likewise. The H2 yield is defined as (moles of H2 produced)/[2×(moles of CH4 fed)]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD analysis The XRD patterns for representative samples are shown in Fig. 1 . The used samples here are those that had been used for the POM reaction, and each used sample had experienced a set of reaction experiments in which the reaction temperature was changed from 673 to 1073K with an interval of 50°. The starting temperature was usually 1023K, and then the temperature was raised to 1073K and then decreased to 673K. At each temperature the reaction was carried out for about 30min. In the sample to which no Ni was added, hexagonal strontium hydroxyapatite (Sr10(PO4)6(OH)2) was the major phase and a very small amount of hexagonal strontium phosphate (Sr3(PO4)2) was present. This pattern was not changed after the POM reaction. When the Ni was added, noticeable changes in the patterns were observed even when the amount of Ni added was small. In the fresh (before the POM reaction) SrNiA(1), the XRD pattern was very similar to that of the sample containing no Ni, but in the used SrNiA(1) the amount of the strontium phosphate phase was markedly increased and became comparable to the hydroxyapatite phase. SrNiA(2) showed similar patterns to SrNiA(1) (not shown in Fig. 1 for brevity). As the Ni content increased, the amount of the phosphate phase increased in the fresh catalysts and it further increased after the reaction. In addition, a third phase, with peaks at around 29.9 and 33.7° of 2θ, was observed in the fresh catalysts from SrNiA(5) to SrNiA(15), but this third phase disappeared in the used catalysts. It was clearly seen as shown in Fig. 1 for SrNiA(10). In the used SrNiA(10) as well as in the used SrNiA(5) and SrNiA(15), the phosphate phase became the dominant phase over the hydroxyapatite phase. The peaks for the third phase could not be identified from the JCPDS powder diffraction files, but we assigned them to come from Sr3−x Ni x (PO4)2, a part of the Sr2+ being substituted with Ni2+ and having a hexagonal structure. Since the ionic radius of Ni2+ is 69pm and that of Sr2+ is 126pm, the d spacing may be somewhat contracted by the Ni substitution. Then, the results showed that the d spacings of (015) and (110) planes (at around 29.9 and 33.7° of 2θ) became contracted by about 3 and 4pm, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns for fresh SrNiA(10) after different treatments. When treated in air at 1073K, the treatment time did not give a significant effect. However, when treated with hydrogen at 1023K, the hydroxyapatite phase and the third phase disappeared and only the phosphate phase was observed. This indicates that the former two phases are not stable under a reducing environment such as that confronted in the actual POM reaction. This also suggests that the substituted nickel in Sr3−x Ni x (PO4)2 matrix came out of the matrix to form a separated entity such as metallic Ni particles. Further discussion will be made in Section 3.3. When Ni is not present, the strontium hydroxyapatite phase is stable under reducing environment, as reported in a previous work [12]. SrNiA(20) showed quite different XRD patterns compared with the other catalysts. Although it had the highest Ni content (ca. 8.2wt.%) among the catalysts investigated, the third phase was not observed in the fresh catalyst and the dominant phase was the strontium hydroxyapatite phase instead of the strontium phosphate phase. In the used catalyst, the phosphate phase disappeared almost entirely. The reason why this sudden change in the structure occurred with increase of the Ni content is not well understood at present. Further study may be needed to better understand this. It should be noted here that in all the samples other crystalline phases, such as metallic Ni, NiO, nickel phosphates including nickel pyrophosphate, and various strontium nickel oxides were not observed by XRD, although some of these may be anticipated to exist. 3.2 XPS and EDS analyses Sr 3d5/2 (∼133eV), Sr 3d3/2 (∼135eV), P 2p (132–133eV) lines were so closely located that they were overlapped. Fig. 3 presents XPS spectra in the Ni 2p region for SrNiA(10). No significant change was observed between the fresh and used catalysts. It should be noted here that the reaction experiment was usually ended at a low reaction temperature of 673K, where the methane conversion was very low and the catalyst was exposed to an oxidizing environment. The peaks at binding energies of ∼857 and 875eV are for Ni2+ 2p3/2 and 2p1/2. The peak at a binding energy of ∼862eV is the shake-up satellite peak [2]. The binding energy of Ni 2p3/2 in NiO is reported to be ∼854eV, and that in NiAl2O3, NiSO4 or NiSiO3 to be 856–857eV [2,13]. Therefore, the peak at the binding energy of ∼857eV is considered to come from Ni2+ probably in Ni–O–P structure. However, the presence of NiO at the surface could not be clearly identified even in the used sample. This suggests that not all the nickel substitutes the Sr in the strontium phosphate structure and a great part of the nickel forms nickel phosphate during catalyst preparation and that only a part of the nickel may be present as NiO after the reaction. Another peak at a binding energy of 851–852eV was observed, but no assignment could be made for this peak because it did not match metallic Ni (852.7eV) or others. Due to the overlapping of Sr 3d and P 2p lines and the complexity of the Ni 2p peaks, no attempt was made for the quantitative analysis of the elements. Table 1 shows the EDS analysis results. It should be recalled here that the EDS results reflect the composition somewhere between the surface and bulk of the catalyst particles since the penetration depth is a few microns, neither shallow nor deep. For the catalysts from SrNiA(2) to SrNiA(15), the atomic ratios of Ni/(Sr+Ni) determined by the EDS were all significantly smaller than the ratio employed in the preparation. For SrNiA(20), the ratio determined by the EDS, ∼0.02, was much smaller than 0.20, the ratio employed in the preparation. These results are perplexing to elucidate, and the catalysts seem to have complicated structure. A plausible explanation needs several assumptions. Since the Ni/(Sr+Ni) ratio determined by EDS was smaller than that employed in the preparation, it might be assumed that, besides metallic Ni or NiO, some other nickel compound, such as nickel phosphate or nickel pyrophosphate, was formed and that this was amorphous so that it was not observed by XRD. It might be further assumed that this compound exists in the core of the catalyst particles and is surrounded by strontium phosphate, nickel-substituted strontium phosphate and strontium hydroxyapatite, so that a large part of the nickel in the core was not detected by the EDS. Especially for SrNiA(20), since the composition of Ni observed by the EDS was quite low, a greater amount of nickel phosphate or pyrophosphate might have been formed. If so, a greater amount of the phosphate would have been consumed to form nickel phosphate or nickel pyrophosphate and the remaining Sr/P ratio would become higher, inducing the formation of strontium hydroxyapatite. Furthermore, since the composition of Sr determined by the EDS was quite high compared with Ni and P, it is suspected that a significant amount of amorphous strontium oxide or carbonate is present at the outer shell of the catalyst particles. By the EDS analysis, formation of carbon deposit or coke was observed in some catalysts after the POM reaction. Coke formation on SrNiA(10) and SrNiA(15) is because they are very active catalysts having metallic Ni. The higher amount of coke in SrNiA(15) than in SrNiA(10) may be due to a higher content of Ni. However, deactivation of the catalyst was not observed during the reaction of up to 30h. Coke formation on SrNiA(20) was smaller than that on SrNiA(15) and this is considered due to its lower activity. 3.3 Catalytically active component It is generally known that the active component for the POM is metallic Ni or Rh rather than the oxide [1,4,5]. In this work, however, the presence of metallic Ni was not observed in the calcined catalyst and no pre-reduction was performed for the catalyst before the reaction experiment. A set of experiments with sequential increase and then decrease of the reaction temperature was carried out over SrNiA(10), and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . When started at 673K, the methane conversion was about 1%. At 773K, the methane conversion was 8% and the sole reaction products were CO2 and H2O. At 823K, a sudden change in both the methane conversion and the selectivity occurred. The methane conversion increased to 52% and the O2 conversion became virtually 100%. The CO selectivity and H2 yield were 45 and 41%, respectively. With further increase of the reaction temperature, the O2 conversion remained virtually 100%, and the methane conversion, CO selectivity and H2 yield increased gradually. At 1073K they were 98.3, 97.5 and 89.3%, respectively, and the H2/CO ratio was close to 2. When the reaction temperature was subsequently decreased with 50° intervals, the methane conversion, CO selectivity and H2 yield decreased gradually and did not retrace the pathway at around 800K observed during the initial temperature increase. At 723K, the methane conversion, CO selectivity and H2 yield were 36, 12 and 20%, respectively. At 673K, the methane conversion and CO selectivity suddenly dropped to about 2% and zero. When the reaction temperature was increased again, the methane conversion similarly followed the lower curve, but a slight difference was observed. At 823K, the methane conversion was 21% with no CO and H2 produced, and the sudden increase occurred at 873K, 50° higher than before. However, once the conversion reached the upper curve, it followed the same pathway as before. Provided that the reaction temperature was not decreased below about 723K, the conversions of methane and O2, the CO selectivity and the H2 yield were reproducible, retracing the upper curve in Fig. 4. Similar phenomena to the hysteresis in Fig. 4 have been observed in other works on supported nickel oxide catalysts [1,2,5]. Although some experimental conditions in those works and in this work are different, especially as to the catalyst type, space velocity and partial pressures of methane and oxygen in the feed, the common results are the following: in the lower curve the methane conversion does not exceed 25% (the maximum conversion when only the complete oxidation occurs with the CH4/O2 feed ratio of 2) and CO2 and H2O are the sole products; in the upper curve the O2 conversion was virtually 100%. The differences include the temperatures at which the sudden increase and decrease in the methane conversion occur. Dissanayake et al. [1] as well as van Looij and Geus [5] explained about the hysteresis as follows. At the lower curve, the nickel is present as an oxidized state, yielding completely oxidized products, but at a certain high temperature it is reduced rapidly by H2, CO or CH4 to the metallic state, giving partially oxidized products. Upon decreasing the temperature, the metallic nickel remains for a while, but eventually the metallic nickel is all re-oxidized by the O2 at a certain low temperature. The main point is that metallic nickel is the active and effective component for the selective partial oxidation of methane. Therefore, for the catalysts in this work, it is believed that the nickel is originally present in an oxidized state but that metallic nickel is produced at high temperatures. It might be produced from the nickel-substituted strontium phosphate phase, which was observed in the fresh catalyst but disappeared after the reaction or H2 treatment. Since the metallic nickel was not observed by XRD, it may be present as highly dispersed particles. This production of metallic Ni resembles in some sense the results of other works [9,10], in which nickel species evolves from the perovskite matrix and is reduced to form fine metallic Ni particles. Highly dispersed nickel metal particles have been reported to be very effective in POM for improvement of selectivity and prevention of coke formation [7,9,10]. One thing to state here is that during the catalyst preparation not all the nickel went into the strontium phosphate structure by substituting the strontium but that a significant amount of nickel phosphate was formed since Ni–O–P structure was observed by XPS even in the used catalyst. Therefore, the amount of Ni particles formed under reaction conditions will be considerably smaller than the amount of nickel employed in the preparation. For instance, the total nickel content in SrNiA(10) was about 4% by weight, but the amount of nickel detected by EDS was about 0.9at.% (Table 1), corresponding to about 1.6wt.% of Ni. Failure of detection of metallic Ni or NiO by XRD may be partly due to its small amount. In order to clarify the working state of Ni, we tried to measure the amount of hydrogen chemisorption on this catalyst after reduction by hydrogen, but we failed because the adsorption amount was so small. Due to the hysteresis, the subsequent experiments were carried out by starting at 1023K, and then the reaction temperature was raised or lowered. The experiment usually ended at 673K. 3.4 Effect of the nickel content Strontium hydroxyapatite having no Ni showed poor catalytic performance in POM. For instance at 1023K, the methane conversion was ca. 20% with the CO2 selectivity of 94%, CO selectivity of 1%, C2H6 selectivity of 4%, and no H2 produced [12]. Over the Ni-added catalysts, CO and CO2 were the only carbon-containing products. SrNiA(1), which had only 1mol% of Ni out of (Sr+Ni), showed significantly improved performance: at 1023K, the methane conversion was 50% with the CO selectivity of 67%, the CO2 selectivity of 33%, and the H2 yield of ca. 40%. Effects of the Ni content in the SrNiA(a) catalysts on the activity, selectivity and H2 yield are shown in Figs. 5–7 . The performances of the catalysts from SrNiA(2) to SrNiA(15) were excellent, and SrNiA(10) or SrNiA(15) appeared to be the best. With further increase of the nickel content, the activity became lower and SrNiA(20) showed poor performance. When the Ni content is low, the amount of the active component will be low and the catalytic performance will be poor. For SrNiA(20), since the third phase assigned to Ni-substituted strontium phosphate, which is believed to be the precursor of the metallic Ni, was not observed in the fresh catalyst, the amount of the metallic Ni produced would also be low. Over SrNiA(10) and SrNiA(15), the obtained methane conversions or CO and H2 concentration were close to or higher than those at the equilibrium. The methane conversions or CO and H2 concentrations in excess of those expected at thermodynamic equilibrium have been reported in some earlier works [2,14,15]. An explanation for this is that the actual catalyst bed temperature is significantly higher than the measured catalyst bed temperature, usually measured by a thermocouple, since the reaction is exothermic. Although POM is an exothermic reaction, complete oxidation is much more exothermic, so that consumption of CO2 and H2O by reacting with CH4 becomes more favorable as the temperature increases, to produce more CO and H2 as a whole. Dissanayake et al. [2] detected hot spots in the catalyst bed by an optical pyrometer. The hot spot temperature was much higher than the measured temperature. When the hot spot temperature was used, the observed concentrations were somewhat less than those predicted at equilibrium. They also reported that the hot zone was often located near the top of the bed and that the thickness of hot zone was very small and the temperature just 1mm above or below it was considerably lower. Therefore, the hot spot temperature is difficult to measure by a thermocouple and the temperature of the catalyst bed may not be uniform. 4 Conclusions Nickel-added strontium phosphate catalysts showed excellent performance for the partial oxidation of methane. Over the optimum catalyst, the methane conversions and the H2 and CO concentrations exceeding those predicted at the equilibrium were obtained. From the XRD analysis, the crystalline phases observed were strontium phosphate, strontium hydroxyapatite and a third phase, but metallic nickel, NiO and nickel phosphate were not observed. The third phase was assigned to be nickel-substituted strontium phosphate, but it disappeared after the reaction. It was suggested that the catalytically active species is metallic nickel. This metallic nickel is considered to come from the third phase under reducing environment, giving highly dispersed nickel metal particles. References [1] D. Dissanayake M.P. Rosynek K.C.C.
