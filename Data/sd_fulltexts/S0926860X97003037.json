Depending on the amount of metal alkoxide it is possible to obtain, after steaming of the surface and calcination, different coverage degree up to the monolayer. Iteration of the grafting technique gives a multilayer, completely modifying the original surface. Grafting aluminium and zirconium alkoxides pre-treated in homogeneous phase with pure sulphuric acid leads to catalysts with very strong acid sites on the surface. The acidic properties of the catalysts obtained by grafting aluminium and zirconium alkoxides and their sulphate derivatives on silica have been characterized by different techniques such as: potentiometric titrations, Temperature Programmed Desorption of organic bases and differential calorimetry to evaluate the density of the active sites and their strength. Prepared catalysts were proven in test reactions such as methanol dehydration and hydrocarbon isomerization and cracking. We have shown that sulphated catalysts have very strong acid sites of both the Brrnsted and Lewis type, able to promote hydrocarbon isomerization and cracking at the relatively low temperature of 250)C. ~; 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

On the contrary, dif- ferent papers have been published on the impregnation of silica in aqueous solution with alumina precursors [8]. By considering the large availability of different alkoxides, at present, the lack of papers on this subject in literature is surprising and, in spite of the easily recognizable potential advantages and versatility of the surface modifications obtained with this technique, the argument has not yet deepened enough. As a matter of fact, it is possible to modify surfaces rich of hydroxyls by grafting alkoxides: with low coverage degree to obtain, after steaming of the surface and calcination, a high dispersion of the corresponding oxide or isolated acid sites of particular strength; with a monolayer, by completely altering the nature of the original surface as to the density of the hydroxyls and the kind of acidity; with multilayers, by repeating the treatments of steaming and calcination after each grafting opera- tion, to obtain a solid with a chemically different surface but retaining the original mechanical and structural properties; it is also possible, before grafting, to opportunely modify the available alkoxide to make it volatile, when we want to perform a gas-solid phase opera- tion, or soluble in aprotic solvents, if we want a liquid-solid phase reaction, or, at last, it is possible to introduce by reaction another compound in the alkoxide molecule to obtain bifunctionality or superacidity. In the present work and in subsequent notes, we will study many of the mentioned possibilities of grafting alkoxides and derivatives on the most common car- riers. In particular, in this note, the preparation and properties of catalysts obtained by grafting with dif- ferent coverage degree aluminium and zirconium alkoxides and their sulphate derivatives on the silica surface will be studied. The catalysts obtained were examined with electrochemical techniques to evaluate the density of the hydroxyls the ZPC (Zero Point Charge) and the intrinsic surface ionization constants. The same catalysts were subjected to TPD (Tempera- ture Programmed Desorption) analysis with two dif- ferent organic bases to determine the semiquantitative distribution of acid sites, and some samples were also submitted to the microcalorimetric analysis using pyridine as probe molecule. Finally, catalysts were tested in two different reactions: the methanol dehy- dration, which is normally promoted by the acid sites of low or medium strength, and the n-hexane isomer- ization and cracking, which is favoured by strong acidic sites. 2. Experimental 2.1. Apparatus, methods and reagents 2.1.1. Preparation of catalysts Catalysts were prepared by contacting a silica sup- port with specific area of about 280mZ/g with an alkoxide solution in toluene. Commercially available aluminium isopropoxide is readily soluble in toluene and can, therefore, be used directly after purification. Purification was made by dispersing hydroxylated insoluble aluminium in benzene and filtering it. Ben- zene is then eliminated by vaporization. Zirconium alkoxide in the form of a solution of tetra-n-butoxide (80%) in n-butanol (20%) was submitted to the exchange reaction with 1-octanol: Zr(OC4H9)4 -- 4CH3(CH2)vOH --+ Zr(OCsH17)4 + 4C4H9OH ~\" (I) The reaction was performed at 140 by distilling off both the n-butanol originally contained in the solution and formed during the reaction. Zirconium octanoxide is a white solid readily soluble in toluene which can, therefore, be used in this form for grafting purposes. Sulphate derivatives of both aluminium and zirconium alkoxides were then prepared as described elsewhere [9,10] by adding pure sulphuric acid (100% by weight), drop by drop, to the alkoxide solution in toluene at room temperature. The following reaction occurs: M(OR),, + H2SO4 --~ M(OR),~_2SO4 + 2ROH (2) and the products obtained are described in detail in previous works of Di Serio et al. [9,10]. Silica used for grafting was previously calcined at 500 for about 2 h. Weighed amounts of silica were put in 100 cm3 of the alkoxide solution and kept at 110 for 6 h by refluxing toluene and stirring the slurry. The reactions occurring can be schemed in a simplified way as follows: P. lengo et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 85-101 87 Me(OR)n-1 + ROH OH + Me(OR)n toluene (3) OH + Me(OR)n ~ 7 toluene OH (4) ~ OH + Me(OR)m-2SO4 b OMe(OR)m-3SO4 + ROH (5) After reaction, the solid obtained was recovered by filtration, washed with toluene, dried, put in a fixed bed and steamed at 150, in the case of aluminium, and 190cc in the case of zirconium. Hydrolysis was prolonged for about 2 h. Then, steamed catalysts were discharged and calcined at 500 for 2 h with the exception of zirconia sulphated catalyst calcined at 400 for 3 h to avoid decomposition of the sulphate group occurring in the range 450-500. The zirco- nium sulphate catalysts were red or brown like the corresponding precursor in homogeneous solution. Zirconium sulphate catalysts prepared in this way seems, therefore, to be quite different from the ones prepared with the classical way reported by the lit- erature because they are coloured and much sensitive to the temperature. 2.1.2. Determination of the amounts of metal anchored on the support The amounts of aluminium grafted on silica were determined by dissolving weighed quantities of the solid samples with an aqueous solution of KOH and analyzing the solutions obtained by atomic absorption spectrometry at 309.3 nm. Grafted zirconium was determined by dissolving it with 6 M HC1 kept in contact with the solid for 24 h. A known amount of the solution obtained was then treated with Xylenol Orange forming a red-orange complex having a maximum light absorption at 535 nm [11]. Zirco- nium-treated samples were, therefore, analyzed spectrophotometrically. Sulphur in the samples treated with sulphuric acid does not interfere in both cases. 2.2. Catalysts characterization, techniques employed Catalysts were characterized by using different techniques such as potentiometry, TGA (Thermo Gravimetric Analysis), TPD (Temperature Pro- grammed Desorption) using two different organic bases such as pyridine and 2,6-dimethylpyridine, and microcalorimetry, by pyridine adsorption. The performances of the catalysts prepared were tested by measuring their activities in the dehydration of methanol for the grafted alkoxides and in the n-hexane isomerization and cracking for the grafted sulphate alkoxides. The potentiometric characterization consists in titrating 50 cm3 of a slightly acidic (pHi3) solution of NaCI 0.1 M additioned with HC1, with NaOH 0.1 M or, on the contrary, a basic solution of NaOH (pH~ 10) with HC1 0.1 M, respectively in the presence or in the absence of a weighed amount of a solid catalyst. Following the approach suggested by Helmy [12] and simplified by Contescu and Vass [13], by compar- ing the volume of titrating solutions added to the suspension and to the blank, respectively, it is possible to evaluate the surface charge with the relation: (7 = i(z~V * CH+/OH)/ms (6) and to obtain the plot of the surface charge as a function of pH. From a plot of this type it is then possible to estimate, by extrapolation at a-0, the density of the hydroxyls on the surface with the relationships: Y = T - k. X (7) + 2 +2 Y = a([H+]2 -+- [Hzpc] )/([H ] - [Hzpc]2) (8) + 9 X = a[H+]/([H+]2 [Hzpc]-) (9) and, still by extrapolation at a 0, the intrinsic surface ionization constants kj and k2: kl = [H+][Sn - OH]s/[Sn - OH2~]s = (T - ~)[H+]/c~ (lO) k2 [H+][Sn -- O-]s/[Sn - OH]s -- -~r[H+]/(T + ~7) (ll) An example of such calculations is reported in Fig. 1 concerning the behaviour of the silica support used in this work.

In Fig. 1 (c), pKa values are reported as a function of the surface charge to determine the intrinsic ionization constants by extrapolation at the ZPC. Thermogravimetric analyses were performed on both the carrier and all the catalysts prepared to evaluate the number of hydroxyls released for dehy- dration between 500 and 1000. This number was then compared with the corresponding value obtained from potentiometric measurements. TPD (Temperature Programmed Desorption) runs were performed by previously saturating a weighed sample of the catalyst with an organic base such as pyridine (Fluka, Milan, Italy, 98% purity) or 2,6- dimethylpyridine (Fluka, Milan, Italy, 98% purity) at temperatures 15-20 higher than the boiling point of the corresponding base. Helium was used as a carrier gas with flow rates ranging between 6 and 10 cm3/min, and a TCD as detector. Then, temperature was increased with a scanning rate of 10/min up to 170 and kept isothermal for about 2 h. In this way, physically adsorbed molecules of the different bases were completely released. After this pretreatment, temperature was again increased with a scanning rate of 10/rain up to 420 and kept isothermal for the time necessary to obtain a negligible release of the chemically adsorbed base. As the area of the peaks obtained from chromatograms resulted proportional to the amount of organic base injected, it is possible to evaluate the chromatographic factor and, conse- quently, to determine the amount of base released at each temperature. We have used two different bases because, as reported by Benesi [ 14], 2,6-dimethylpyr- P. lengo et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 85-101 89 idine is almost selectively adsorbed on Br6nsted sites, while pyridine reacts with both Br6nsted and Lewis sites of high and medium strength. We observed that more acid sulphate catalysts does not completely release the organic bases, at 420'~C but we avoided increasing this temperature to prevent the occurrence of sulphate decomposition. However, these runs had the main scope to show the change of acid-base properties occurring on the surface as a consequence of grafting the alkoxides. Calorimetric runs were performed on samples of about 80 mg preliminarly kept at 400 for 12 h at 2.0.10-8 atm. The adsorption isotherms were carried out in a Tian-Calvet calorimeter of the Setaram using pyridine as probe molecule. Different known amounts of pyridine were added to the catalysts until a pressure of 1.2-10 3 atm was reached. Then, the samples were outgassed at 150 for 12 h and a second adsorption isotherm was run up to the same final pressure. The difference between both isotherms is the amount of irreversibly adsorbed pyridine, From the calorimetric data, the integral and differential adsorption heats, the number of sites and their distribution according to the adsorption energies can be determined. The performances of the catalysts were tested, as mentioned before, by measuring the activities shown respectively in the dehydration of methanol in the case of grafted alkoxides, characterized by acidity of med- ium and low strength, and by n-hexane isomerization and cracking reactions in the case of grafted sulphate alkoxides, characterized by the presence of strong acidic sites on their surface. Activity tests were per- formed in both cases in a stainless steel tubular reactor of 0.5 i.d. operating in isothermal conditions. A syringe pump was used for feeding the liquid reagents in both cases. Helium was used as a diluent and carrier gas in the case of methanol dehydration, nitrogen in the case of n-hexane isomerization and cracking. A sampling valve, kept at 150, allows the on line analysis of the products and of the residual reagent in both cases. Methanol dehydration was performed at about 180~C in the presence of 1-2 g of catalyst by using a methanol feed rate of 1.05 cm3/h while the helium flow rate was 300 cm3/h. As the obtained conversions were lower than 5%, the reactor can be considered as a differential one and the initial reaction rates can be easily determined. Reaction products and the residual reagent were analyzed using an HP 5890A gas-chromatograph equipped with a capillary column of 0.53 mm i.d. containing Carbowax 20 M as sta- tionary phase and TCD as detector. The column was heated at a scanning rate of 180/h from 50 to 60C and then kept isothermal at this temperature. The Helium head column pressure was 2 atm. Some kinetic runs were also performed by feeding pyridine dissolved in methanol for poisoning the catalysts and evaluating the number of active sites in the reaction conditions, n-hexane isomerization and cracking reac- tions were studied applying about 1 g of aluminium or zirconium alkoxide sulphate at different temperatures of, respectively, 250, 300 and 400~C, with a flow rate of 0.5 cm3/h of liquid n-hexane and 90 cm3/h of nitrogen. The analyses were performed by an HP 5890A gas-chromatograph equipped with a FID detec- tor and a capillary column of Poraplot 25 M 0.32 mm i.d. n-hexane, n-pentane, 2-methylpentane (2MP), 3- methylpentane (3MP) and methylcyclopentane (MCP) were recognized using samples of pure com- pounds furnished by Fluka (Milan, Italy). Other hydrocarbons were identified and determined with the aid of Kovats indexes [15]. The data obtained were interpreted by considering the reactor operating in differential conditions, the overall conversions obtained being lower than 5%. The reaction rates for isomerization and cracking were determined as: (12) ri=f'Xi/mc=(f/mc)\" (~fijAij/~fjAj) (13) and selectivities are S=Xi/Xc. The detailed distribu- tion of the reaction products for both isomerization and cracking is also available. We preferred in all cases to refer the amount of the supported alkoxides to the weight of catalyst instead of the surface area in order to avoid inaccuracy due to the change of this parameter, introduced by the grafting reaction followed by steaming and calcina- tion. The weight of catalyst has been used in the text as a reference, for the same reason, also in the case of defining the reaction rates and in the plot of TPD runs. 90 t~ lengo et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 85-101 Table 1 List of the catalysts prepared by grafting aluminium and zirconimn alkoxide on silica Catalyst Silica support Metal alkoxide Metal H2SO4 Supported metal (g/din3) (g/dm3) (mmol/g) 100% (cm~) (mmol/g) C~1 48.5 2.6 0.26 - 0.07 C~e 50.0 11.2 1.10 - 0.71 Cml 41.2 28.0 3.33 -- 2.10 Cm2 50.0 30.5 2.98 - 4.45 Cm3 50.0 31.0 3.30 - 6.92 Ca~ 45.0 39.8 4.33 0.99 1.83 C~l 68.4 74.0 2.82 0.65 C~ 69.5 72.8 2.73 0.75 0.52 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Determination of the surface properties of the catalysts prepared by potentiometric titrations and TGA The catalysts prepared by grafting on silica, with the already described technique, aluminium isoprop- oxide, zirconium octanoxide, and related sulphate derivatives are summarized in Table 1. In all cases, alkoxides in a toluene solution are not quantitatively adsorbed on the surface and an adsorp- tion equilibrium seems to be operative. Therefore, in order to obtain a greater degree of surface coverage, more concentrated alkoxide solu- tions must be used. As it can be seen, by increasing the aluminium isopropoxide concentration in toluene from 2.6 to 28 g/dm3, an increase in adsorbed aluminium from 0.07 to 2.1 mmol/g is obtained. in this way we prepared three catalysts (Ca~, C~2, Cm~) differing only in the amount of aluminium anchoring on the surface. The catalyst named Cml corresponds to a solid obtained by saturating the surface with an amount of aluminium corresponding to about a monolayer. Cm2 has been obtained by hydrolyzing Cml with steam and by contacting again the solid obtained with aluminium isopropoxide dissolved in toluene. By repeating steaming and grafting on Cm2, we obtained Cm3; to conclude, Cruz and Cm3 correspond to the multilayer adsorptions of aluminium oxide on silica. Cas is a catalyst obtained by grafting sulphate aluminium isopropoxide. Zirconium octanoxide and the related sulphate are less reactive than aluminium as it can be seen by the amount adsorbed in the preparation of Czl and Czs catalysts, still reported in Table 1 together with the conditions adopted for grafting. All the catalysts of Table 1 were submitted to electrochemical characterization to evaluate the hydroxyl densities, the ZPC and the surface intrinsic ionization constants, K1 and K2. The results obtained are reported in Table 2. The same table also shows, for comparison pur- poses, the values obtained for the silica support used (280 m2/g), for a commercial 7-alumina (180 m2/g) and a commercial silica-alumina obtained by co-pre- cipitation (alumina was 13,6% by weight, the specific surface area was 140 m2/g). All the catalysts were also submitted to TGA to determine the water release in the range between 500 and 1000. The hydroxyl den- sities determined by this method are also reported in Table 2 for comparison purposes. From the data reported in Table 2 we can observe, first of all, that grafted alumina on the silica surface abruptly changes the properties of the surface, as expected. In fact, the values of pK1 and pK2 strongly increase and sample Cml shows values quite similar to those found for silica-alumina obtained by co-precipitation. The PZC values gradually change and the value obtained for the sample Cm3, characterized by a multi- layer deposition of alumina on the silica surface, is comparable with that of 7-alumina. For this sample, we obtained a pKi value similar to those observed for the samples containing less aluminium on the surface while, on the contrary, pK2 is again comparable to that obtained for alumina. However, this sample is also characterized by a strong increase in the density of the P. lengo et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 85-101 Table 2 Results from potentiometric titrations and thermogravimetric analyses 91 Catalyst Supported metal PZC Surface OH pK~I pK,~2 Surface OH by (mmol/g) (mmol/g) TGA (mmol/g) Silica - 2.2 2.50 0.57 3.47 2.20 ,/-Alumina - 7.2 1.05 5.70 9.30 1.00 Silica-alumina - 4.5 1.08 2.63 6.57 1.10 Ca~ 0.07 3.6 2.78 1.70 4.17 1.75 Ca2 0.71 4.2 1.65 2.81 4.75 1.29 Cn, l 2.10 4.5 4.23 2.63 6.57 2.31 Cm3 6.92 6.9 7.80 2.69 7.72 2.45 C~ 1.83 4.1 4.84 2.64 5.50 C~l 0.65 2.0 2.89 0.52 3.48 2.43 C~ 0.52 2.2 1.10 0.65 3.35 hydroxyl on the surface for the values estimated by potentiometric titration. In this case, the values are not in agreement with those obtained by TGA. An expla- nation for the disagreement observed in the case of grafted catalysts (not for silica, alumina and silica- alumina) could be the fact that samples calcined at 500 could have unstable and reactive surfaces giv- ing much more hydroxyls when put in liquid water for potentiometric determinations. Nevertheless, we can r /OH -- Si --o--AI I \\o. roughly conclude that in both cases a decrease or an increase of the hydroxyl densities can be observed with respect to silica according to the amount of grafted alumina.

In this case, the surface hydroxyl density should be increased and, while repeating this more times, we could have: I /OA~OR + AI(OR)J ~ -- Si --o--AI ~OR [ ~OAI/OR \"\"-oR Consequently, according to the various conditions, it is possible to obtain an increase or a decrease in the density of hydroxyl although the parameter strongly depends on other factors such as the modalities of steaming and calcination.

It can be concluded that 92 t3. lengo et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 85-101 2- 0 Q (mmol/g) -2. -4- o io .S B 0 0 o o o Cas I I T 4 5 6 Fig. 2.

As to grafted zirconium, the amount of this element anchored on the surface probably is small to change the properties of the surface and, as it will be seen, great differences appeared only in the acid properties determined by activity in the catalytic reaction tests. 3.4. Determination of acid surface properties by TPD All the prepared catalysts were submitted to TPD after the adsorption of different organic bases, as already described in a previous section, with the aim to show the effect of grafting alkoxides on the acid-base properties of silica support. This effect can be well appreciated by observing Figs. 3 and 4. In Fig. 3 the results obtained for the catalyst Ca1, Ca2, CmI,C~I and the corresponding support SiO2, by using pyridine as a base, are reported. In Fig. 4 the beha- viours of Cal, Ca2, Cml and Czl in the presence of the base 2,6-dimethylpyridine are compared. As it can be seen, in both cases, the presence of the alumina on the silica surface strongly increases the acidity of both the Br6nsted and Lewis type sites. A semiquantitative estimation of the number of acid sites can be derived from TPD plots such as the ones reported in Figs. 3 and 4. The obtained results are summarized in Table 3. We considered, in this table, three classes of acid sites depending on the desorption range temperature: weak acid sites (T<250), inter- mediate acid sites (250<T<400) and strong acid sites (T>400). The number of sites reported in Table 3 is underestimated in the case of C,,s and Czs catalysts because, the final temperature of 420 is too low to completely remove the organic bases. In fact, the overall number of acid sites determined for C~,~ appears in Table 3 to be lower than the one determined for Cml. On the contrary, the situation is reversed in the case of calorimetric analyses, as it will be seen in the next section. Another evidence of the presence of strong acid sites not revealed by TPD is the activity shown by Ca~ and Cz~ in the reaction of n-hexane isomerization and cracking. On the other hand the sulphate zirconia catalyst resulted relatively unstable in the range 450-500, giving place to decomposi- tion of the sulphate groups. However, from the observation of TPD plots and the data reported in Table 3 we can conclude, first of all, that grafting alkoxides completely change the acid- base properties of the surface of the silica used as a P. lengo et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 85-101 93 0.016 450 t-. g t- O 0 E3 0.014 0.012 - 0.010 - 0.008 - 0.006 - 0.004 - 0.002 - 0.000 0 Cml // .................. ,.) //1 I I I I 10 20 30 40 time (min) 400 350 300 --I 0 250 200 150 50 Fig. 3.

Then, the catalyst Ca~ shows less acid sites than Cm~ but some of them are stronger because of the release of the organic bases at higher temperatures. The same occurs for Czs when compared with Czl. Another observation is that Cml has mainly Br6nsted acid sites, while on Ca~ Lewis acid sites of high strength are present. Both Br6nsted and Lewis acid sites also appears on the surface of C~1 and C~s. 3.5. Calorimetric measurements Catalysts Ca2, Cml, Cm3, Cas, Czl and the silica support were submitted to calorimetric analysis using pyridine as probe molecule, as mentioned in a pre- vious section. As expected, silica support almost shows only reversible adsorption and a low differential adsorption heat roughly corresponding to the pyridine 94 t~ lengo et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 85-101 Table 3 Semiquantitative estimation of active sites on the surface by TPD using different organic bases Catalyst Pyridine (mmol/g) 2,6-dimethylpiridine (mmol/g) w i s w i Silica 0.01 0.04 0.01 - - Ca1 0.01 0.05 0.01 0.01 0.05 0.01 QL2 0.01 0.11 0.05 0.02 0.09 0.06 Cml 0.01 0.15 0.06 0.02 0.15 0.03 Cm3 0.02 0.11 0.06 0.01 0.09 0.06 Cas 0.01 0.09 0.06 0.01 0.07 0.04 C, I 0.01 0.16 0.05 0.002 0.086 0.032 C~ 0 0.06 0.09 0 0.03 0.05 w-weak (T<250\"C), i-intermediate (250<400 C), s=strong (T>400).

On the con- trary, all the grafted catalysts examined, that adsorb more pyridine than silica show high amount of irre- versible adsorbed pyridine and high differential adsorption heat, especially at low coverage, as it can be appreciated in Table 4. In this table, the amounts of overall and irreversibly adsorbed pyridine, respectively, are reported together with the initial adsorption heat. As it can be appreciated a satisfactory agreement has been obtained between the irreversible adsorbed pyridine and the desorbed pyridine at TPD reported in Table 3 with the exclusion of Cas that shows a number of acid site greater than Cml. The obtained differential adsorption heats for different coverage for the examined catalysts are reported in Fig. 5, while in Fig. 6 integral adsorp- tion heats as a function of coverage degree are reported. From the calorimetric data it is possible to evaluate the number of acid sites of different strength as reported in Table 5. As it can be seen the amount of acid sites reported in this table are lower than those reported in Table 3. This can be explained considering that in Table 5 we assumed as low strength sites those having a heat of pyridine adsorption in the range 90- 120 kJ/mol, that are quite high values. However, these results confirm that grafted catalysts have more and more acidic sites than the original silica support; grafted aluminium sulphated catalyst has a larger amount of strong acid sites with respect to the grafted catalysts untreated with sulphuric acid. We also tested sulphated zirconium-based catalyst but the number of strong acid sites shown by this catalyst seems to be quite low if compared to the TPD runs and the observed catalytic performances that will be reported later. Probably, in this case, the prolonged heating at low pressure made during the pretreatment decompose many of the sulphate sites. For this reason we have not reported calorimetric data related to the sulphated zirconium-based catalyst. 3.6. Methanol dehydration to dimethyl ether, a test reaction for acid sites of medium strength Vapour phase catalysed dehydration of alcohols has been studied by many authors [16-18], in particular P.

This reaction is promoted by both Br6nsted and Lewis sites and the presence of basic sites [20,21] has often a co-operative effect on the catalyst's activity. All the catalysts prepared except the sulphated ones have been tested in this reaction. The results obtained for the activities are reported in Table 6. In the same table, the results obtained using silica, silica-alumina and y-alumina as catalysts are also reported. -alumina resulted in being the best catalyst for this reaction because, as a consequence of drying during calcination, it gives rise to vicinal Lewis acid and basic sites [20] 96 P lengo et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 85-101 Table 5 Results of the calorimetric analyses: number of acid sites of different strength Catalyst Low strength sites Medium strength sites High strength sites (90<ha< 120 kJ/mol ) (mmol/g) ( 120<hA< 150 kJ/mol) (mmol/g) (hA> 150 kJ/mol ) (mmol/g) silica - - - Ca: 0.084 0.043 0.025 Cm I 0.117 0.058 0.005 Cm3 0.056 0.044 0.012 C~ 0.106 0.088 0.043 CL1 0.070 0.054 0.002 Table 6 Reaction rates in the dehydration of methanol Catalyst Reaction rate (mmol CH3OH/hg,,at) Silica 0,009 y-alumina 4.00 Silica-alumina 2,25 Cal 0,71 Ca2 3.25 C~3 3,75 Cm3 1.80 Czl 0.11 OH OH o(-) -H20 AI AI o/ \\ = - / \\o/ \\ strongly promoting the reaction. For this reason, the reaction is poorly depressed by the addition of organic bases such as pyridine [19,20]; on the contrary, the reaction could be strongly depressed by adding acetic acid [21 ]. As it can be seen from the data reported in Table 6, silica is not active while silica-alumina is half active than alumina, despite the presence of stronger acid sites on the surface. The increase of alumina grafted on the surface determines an increase in the reaction activity. All the catalysts of Table 6 were also sub- mitted to poisoning with pyridine during the dehydra- tion reaction. In Fig. 7, the effect of poisoning on the reaction activity is reported for the different cases related to the catalysts y-alumina, silica-alumina, Ca~, Ca2, Cml and Cm3. AS it can be seen, activity decreases in all the cases until it reaches a residual value corresponding to the action of less acidic sites. The v-alumina catalyst retains more than 50% of the original activity which was in agreement to the obser- vations made by Parera et al. [20]. Silica-alumina retains not more than 20%. Grafted catalysts resemble silica-alumina for both the initial and retained activity after poisoning with pyridine when the grafted alu- mina amount is low and performs as y-alumina for larger amounts of grafted alumina. This fact suggests the prevalence of the sites originated by Si-O-Al bonds and of those originated by A1-O-A1 bonds, in the first and second case, respectively. In Table 7, the amounts of pyridine used for level- ling the catalytic activities, those desorbed by the same catalysts by TPD and those adsorbed by calori- metry are compared. As it can be seen, the amounts found in the three different situations are comparable. 3.7. n-Hexane isomerization and cracking; a test reaction for acid sites of high strength Many papers and reviews have been published dealing with the acidic properties of sulphated zirco- nia catalysts. In particular [22-27]. Despite a signifi- cant number of papers dealing with this argument, the nature of active sites on these catalytic systems is not completely well defined, in particular the role played by Lewis and Br6nsted acid centres is still controver- sial [25]. According to Tanabe [28] Fe203 promoted with sulphate anion shows superacidic properties, the acid sites being considered generated by the formation of a complex of the type: Lewis acid site [] o/; \\o/ o 13 lengo et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 85-101 97 4.0- 3.5- 3.0 2.5 .Ic \"~ 2.0 E E ,~ 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 x SiI.AI Cml o Cm3 a', \" Alumina \",,. o Ca2 '. a, \"~ ......

(+) (+) X'Zr ~,.O..j\",Zr is also possible, while explaining in both cases the promoting effect of the sulphate anion. Very recently it has been shown [8,9] that both sulphated aluminium and zirconium alkoxides are very strong Lewis acids in homogeneous phase. This fact must be taken into account for interpreting what happens on the surface after the grafting. We suggest the formation of struc- tures already seen, that are similar to the ones sug- gested by Arata [24]. However, it is interesting to observe that the cata- lysts that we have prepared by grafting zirconium sulphate alkoxide are different with respect to the catalysts obtained by doping zirconia. First of all, the complex obtained in homogeneous phase that has been used for grafting has a reddish brown colour and this colour is retained after grafting, steaming and calcination, while sulphate doped zirconia is white. Besides our catalysts were much sensitive to sulphate group decomposition with temperature (T>450). For these reasons we have considered not useful, in this preliminary work, to deepen the comparison between the mentioned systems, but only between 98 P, lengo et al./Applied Cotalysis A: Ge~wral 167 (]998) 85-101 the catalysts obtained by grafting and the original silica support. For what concerns sulphated alumina catalysts, very few papers deal with the acidity of this catalytic system [24,29,30]. Therefore, we have few elements for comparison with the catalysts prepared by grafting aluminium sulphated alkoxides. Therefore, our com- parison again will be limited to the original silica support. That is, in the present paper we want to show that grafted sulphate promoted zirconia and alumina catalysts are strong acid catalysts, if compared with the starting silica support because they promote n- hexane isomerization and cracking at relatively low temperatures (250). Both catalysts deactivate, as it normally occurs for this type of reaction promoted by acid sites only. Kinetic runs have been performed at 250C for the catalysts C~ and Czs after a pretreatment in situ at 400c'C in dry air for 2 h. At the end of each tun we have again treated the catalyst in situ in dry air at 500C with the aim to restore initial high activity, but catalyst Czs loses completely catalytic activity while, on the contrary, catalyst Cas showed an increased activity. This behaviour, as mentioned before confirms that sulphate zirconia catalysts prepared by grafting sulphated zirconium alkoxides have strong acidic properties but are unstable to thermal treatments. On the contrary, sulphated alumina catalysts are quite stable. The results obtained are reported in Fig. 8 for C,,~ and in Fig. 9 for C,~, while Table 8 shows the product distributions related to the mentioned tuns.

Consequently, at high temperatures (400), zirconia catalysts become more selective in isomerization than the alumina based ones but decompose at temperatures higher than 450. 4. Conclusions To conclude, in the present work we have shown the possibility to anchor on the surface of a support rich in hydroxyl groups, such as the silica support, different amounts of aluminium and zirconium alkoxides chan- ging the acidic properties of the surface. The catalysts 100 P. lengo et al./Applied 6?ttalvsis A: General 167 (1998) 85-101 obtained are not completely similar to those obtained by co-precipitation, and their preparations are char- acterized by greater flexibility. We have also shown that it is possible to completely change the surface of a support turning, for example, from silica to alumina or zirconia, by repeating more times the operation of grafting the alkoxide and steaming the surface. The support obtained with a completely modified surface retains mechanical and morphological properties. Finally, we have shown that, by reacting both alumi- nium and zirconium alkoxides with pure sulphuric acid (100%) in homogeneous phase and by anchoring the originated alkoxide sulphate on silica, very strong acid catalysts are obtained. These catalysts are able to promote hydrocarbon isomerization and cracking at the relatively low temperature of 250.

Tel. +39 81 5476544; fax +39 81 5527771 In this paper we will show that it is possible to modify the acid properties of a surface, rich of hydroxyl groups by grafting in suitable conditions metal alkoxides, such as aluminium and zirconium alkoxide. Depending on the amount of metal alkoxide it is possible to obtain, after steaming of the surface and calcination, different coverage degree up to the monolayer. Iteration of the grafting technique gives a multilayer, completely modifying the orginal surface. Grafting aluminium and zirconium alkoxides pre-treated in homogeneous phase with pure sulphuric acid leads to catalysts with very strong acid sites on the surface. The acidic properties of the catalysts obtained by grafting aluminium and zirconium alkoxides and their sulphate derivatives on silica have been characterized by different techniques such as: potentiometric titrations, Temperature Programmed Desorption of organic bases and differential calorimetry to evaluate the density of the active sites and their strength. Prepared catalysts were proven in test reactions such as methanol dehydration and hydrocarbon isomerization and cracking. We have shown that sulphated catalysts have very strong acid sites of both the Brönsted and Lewis type, able to promote hydrocarbon isomerization and cracking at the relatively low temperature of 250°C.

        "dc:description": "In this paper we will show that it is possible to modify the acid properties of a surface, rich of hydroxyl groups by grafting in suitable conditions metal alkoxides, such as aluminium and zirconium alkoxide. Depending on the amount of metal alkoxide it is possible to obtain, after steaming of the surface and calcination, different coverage degree up to the monolayer. Iteration of the grafting technique gives a multilayer, completely modifying the orginal surface. Grafting aluminium and zirconium alkoxides pre-treated in homogeneous phase with pure sulphuric acid leads to catalysts with very strong acid sites on the surface. The acidic properties of the catalysts obtained by grafting aluminium and zirconium alkoxides and their sulphate derivatives on silica have been characterized by different techniques such as: potentiometric titrations, Temperature Programmed Desorption of organic bases and differential calorimetry to evaluate the density of the active sites and their strength. Prepared catalysts were proven in test reactions such as methanol dehydration and hydrocarbon isomerization and cracking. We have shown that sulphated catalysts have very strong acid sites of both the Brönsted and Lewis type, able to promote hydrocarbon isomerization and cracking at the relatively low temperature of 250°C.",
