Box 2100, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia Received 3 February 1994: revised 1 August 1994; accepted 28 September 1994 Abstract The effect of preparation conditions on cobalt-silica gel catalysts has been investigated by tem- perature-programmed reduction, differential thermal analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The results have been correlated with the performance of the catalysts for the conversion of syngas. It has been found that active Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) cobalt catalysts can be partially or totally reduced to the metal phase during activation. However, reducibility of the catalysts is a necessary but not sufficient characteristic in ensuring good activity. The pH of the impregnating solution influences surface charge and solubility of silica gel. Consequently, the physical and chemical properties of the cobalt species on the surface of silica gel are strongly affected by this parameter. At pH < 5 cobalt deposits as a cation. At pH < 2 the silica surface is positively charged so that the dispersion of cobalt and consequently catalytic activity are poor. At pH >/5, cobalt reacts to form silicates or hydrosilicates which are irreducible. Active catalysts are shown to adsorb hydrogen by spillover on to the silica support.

Introduction Cobalt was first employed as a Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis catalyst in the early stages of attempts to convert hydrogen and carbon monoxide into hydrocar- bons. The F-T catalyst with cobalt as the major catalytic component is well known for its low water-gas shift activity and moderate reaction conditions [ 1]. These characteristics result in efficient utilization of carbon monoxide and a relatively low external operation cost. However, because cobalt is more costly than iron, the * Corresponding author.

Baker~Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 23-36 development of lightly loaded supported catalysts for the F-T synthesis has received much attention. Silica gel and kieselguhr are the most common supports. Most previous studies have focused on physical or physicochemical properties of surface cobalt species, such as dispersion, distribution, and morphology and their effects on catalytic activity [2-15]. Although some studies have considered the contribution of silica gel to such a catalytic system, in most cases silica gel has been regarded as support material supplying a high surface area for dispersion of the active component [ 14,15 ]. Silica gel, although relatively chemically inert, reacts strongly with cobalt species at high temperatures to form a variety of cobalt silicates [ 16]. Both the surface electronic charge of the silica gel and its ion exchange behaviour in an aqueous solution may significantly affect the interaction between cobalt and silica gel [17,18]. In this study a systematic investigation of the properties of unpromoted cobalt- silica gel catalysts, prepared at different pH of the impregnating solution, was performed by means of various techniques. The characteristics have been correlated with the performance of the catalysts for the conversion of syngas. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of catalysts Catalysts were prepared by direct solution impregnation (incipient wetness vol- ume method). The silica gel support saturated with cobalt nitrate solution was agitated in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min. This was followed by drying in a micro- wave oven for 30 min and calcination in a muffle furnace either at 320 or at 520 for 2 h. The grain size of the silica gel support was 125-150/zm (Aldrich Chemicals grade 62). This material had a surface area of ca. 250 m2 g- 1 and a mean pore diameter of 14 nm. Cobalt solutions were prepared from analytically pure Co(NO3)2.6H20. Other chemicals used in this study were AR grade. The hydrogen and nitrogen employed were of 99.99% purity. The air used for differ- ential thermal analysis (DTA) was purified by passing it through molecular sieves and silica gel traps. 2.2. Apparatus and procedures DTA measurements were conducted using a Shimadzu DT-30 instrument. The catalyst precursor was placed in the furnace and heated in a stream of air to the desired temperature (320 or 520) at a heating rate of 20 min ~ and held at this temperature for 2 h. This treatment simulated the catalysts calcination process. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) apparatus used in the present work was constructed in this laboratory and was based on previously published designs H. Ming, B.G. Baker~Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 23-36 25 [19,20]. A carefully designed gas flow system, equipped with precise pressure regulators, variable constant differential flow controllers and a U-shape gas mixer, provided the system with a stable H2/N2 gas mixture. The mixture was passed through a tube containing reduced cobalt catalyst heated at ca. 200 to convert any possible traces of oxygen to water. The water vapour and other gaseous impu- rities were condensed at a cold trap ( - 100*C) before reaching the reference cell of the thermal conductivity detector (TCD), which was used to monitor changes in the gas composition before and after reduction. The reactor tube was made of silica (4 mm I.D.) seated in a 8 mm I.D. tube furnace which could be heated to 1000. After the gas mixture passed through the reactor, a second cold trap ( - 100) collected reduction products to protect the detector from contamination. TPR measurements were performed using a 96:4 N2/H2 gas mixture (51 ml min i ) at a heating rate of 22 rain- 1. The output of the detector was connected to a chart recorder and a computer. In order to distinguish hydrogen uptake due to reduction of the sample from hydrogen adsorption, a cyclic TPR procedure was developed. The principle of this procedure is to repeatedly run TPR tests on a sample. Peaks which are reproducible in a cycle are interpreted as due to adsorption. A Philips PW/1050 diffractometer equipped with a fine focus cobalt tube ( 1500 W, 60 kV) was used to obtain X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns over the range of 20= 25-75 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded using a Perkin- Elmer 5400 surface analysis system equipped with an A1 Kc~ radiation source. The Si 2p3/2 photoemission line (BE= 103.5 eV) was taken as a reference to correct for electrostatic charging. Magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed by a modified Gouy bal- ance ( Sherwood Scientific). Each sample was reduced in a tube furnace in hydrogen overnight and then sealed at both ends without any exposure to the air. The magnetic susceptibility of a reduced sample was measured at room temperature. Cobalt-silica gel catalysts were tested in a fixed-bed micro reactor. The catalyst was activated in a stream of hydrogen at 320 for 16 h. Most of the reaction tests were conducted under a pressure of 800 kPa at 260 or 280 in the stream of CO/H2 = 1 and at a space velocity of 900 h i. Products were analyzed by gas chromatography. 3. Results A number of samples were prepared at various pH of the impregnating solution. In order to avoid precipitation of cobalt hydroxide at pH ~> 5, complexing agents such as urea and ethylenediamine were employed to stabilize the cobalt ion. The cobalt content in each catalyst was 6% by weight. Some characteristics including preparation conditions of the catalysts are listed in Table 1. Catalysts No. 806, No. 26 H. Ming, B.G.

In contrast, impregnation of the silica gel with cobalt nitrate solution of pH ~< 4.6 produced black catalysts which were identified by XRD as containing Co304. The catalytic activity results are given in Table 2. The activity of No. 810 is higher than for No. 809, particularly at 260, but calcination at higher temperature (520) resulted in the loss of this advantage. The coloured catalysts No. 806 and No. 798 were inactive. However, No. 808 was quite active but produced more methane than No. 810. The TPR profiles of cobalt-silica gel catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. Two kinds of reduction behaviour were observed. The TPR trace of catalyst No. 809 was almost identical to that of catalyst No. 810. Both catalysts were prepared at pH ~< 4.6. A pair of partially resolved peaks observed in traces 1 and 2 reflects the reduction of cobalt oxide, C%O4. From the hydrogen consumption, it is calculated that the first peak accounts for the reduction of Cos + to Co2 + and the second peak for the reduction of CoO to cobalt. The reduction of both catalysts was completed below 450. In contrast, the TPR traces of catalysts prepared at pH >~ 5 showed multiple reduction stages at above 400. This behaviour and the colour of the samples showed that the cobalt surface species were not cobalt oxide. There was little effect of the calcination temperature (320 or 520) on the reduction behaviour of the catalysts prepared at pH ~< 4.6 (Table 3). On the other hand, for the catalysts impregnated at pH >~ 5.0, using complexing agent, the reduc- tion behaviour was strongly dependent on the temperature of calcination. The peaks at 450-500, prominent for No. 798, indicate that the complex was not decom- posed by calcination at 320. The reduced forms of No. 809 and No. 810 (calcined at 320, 2 h) were investigated by cyclic TPR. Results in Fig. 3 were recorded for samples reduced in H. Ming, B.G.

Trace 1 (Fig. 3A) shows that activated No. 809 adsorbs hydrogen at 150-250. The sample heated to 500 performed a similar adsorption profile (trace 2). Trace 3 shows that when the cooling was terminated at 120, the peaks were not observed. The results for No. 810 (Fig. 3B) show similar behaviour with an important exception that the second peak at ca. 250 was absent after the sample had been heated to 520 (trace 3, 4). The reversible uptake of hydrogen measured in these experiments is independent of the time delay between runs. The peaks occur at temperatures below that for reduction. The two peaks are interpreted as due to adsorbed hydrogen. Quantitative results of hydrogen adsorption on activated catalysts are given in Table 4. For No. 809 and No. 810 all the cobalt was reduced to metal at 320. In the case of No. 808, under the same condition, only 26% of the cobalt species underwent reduction. 28 H. Ming, B.G.

Significant increase in the magnetic susceptibility for catalysts No. 809 and No. 810 (pH ~ 4.6; calcined at 320) is consistent with reduction of the surface cobalt oxide species to ferromagnetic metallic cobalt phases.

In contrast, the slight increase in magnetic susceptibility of the catalysts prepared at pH >/5 after activation indicates that cobalt species were not reduced to metal. In order to investigate the interaction of cobalt with silica gel, a number of TPR measurements were made on the series of samples shown in Fig. 4. The physical mixture of Co304 and silica gel was prepared from a non-aqueous suspension. The reduction temperature for catalyst No. 810 (300-350) was lower than that for Co304. Furthermore, the first peak in the TPR spectrum of No. 810 corresponds to the transition Co3 + ~ Co2 +, indicating that the reduction proceeds in stages. The reduction of either pure C0304 or physically mixed Co304 with silica gel was observed as a single peak. When catalyst No. 810 was heated at 1000 for 4 h, the resultant surface species was identified by XRD as Co25iO4, as shown in Fig. 1, trace 5. The calcination step in the catalyst preparation was investigated by DTA (Fig. 5).

Further evidence of the strong interaction of cobalt with silica at high pH was found in the following experiment. Preparation of cobalt-silica gel catalysts was terminated before calcination. Then the samples were washed with water at room temperature and calcined at 3200C for 2 h. The TPR traces of these resultant samples (Fig. 6) show no reduction peaks below 500.

In catalyst No. 810 (calcined at 320 for 2 h) the BE of the Co 2p3/2 peak was similar to that of Co304. Calcination of this system at 1000 for 4 h shifted this peak by 1.4 eV towards higher BE. The Co 2p3/2 electron BE for catalysts No. 798 and No. 808 (prepared at the initial pH of the impregnating solution of 6.3 and 10.0, respectively) were greater by more than 1 eV to that observed for catalyst No. 810 calcined at the same temperature. The XRD meas- urement proved that at the surface of catalyst No. 810 (calcined at 1000 for 4 h) Table 5 Co 2p3/2 and O ls electron binding energies (eV) in cobalt-silica gel catalysts and some reference compounds Sample Surface Co (%)a CO 2p.w2 ACo 2ph O Is Reference 810 3.30 780.2 15.0 533.3 This work 810~ 1.57 781.6 15.5 533.0 This work 798 0.92 781.8 15.8 533.0 This work 808 1.27 781.5 15.8 533.2 This work Co304 N / A 779.6 15.0 531.1 [ 22 ] Silica gel N/A 781.3 532.9 This work Co2SiO4 N/A 781.3 15.9 [23] a Relative surface concentration were calculated using atomic sensitivity factors [22]. b ACo 2p is the difference in binding energy between Co 2p~/2 and Co 2p3/2. c This sample was calcined at 1000 for 4 h and the others at 320 for 2 h. H. Ming, B.G. Baker~Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 23 36 33 cobalt was present as Co2SiO4. The XRD pattern recorded for catalyst No. 810 (calcined at 320 for 2 h) was the same as that for Co304. The energy separation between Co 2pl/2 and Co 2p3/2 (ACo 2p) for catalysts No. 798 and No. 808 was 15.8 eV. This is 0.8 eV greater than that of catalyst No. 810 calcined at 320, but closer to that of Co2SiO4 (/iCo 2p = 15.5 eV). High energy separation between the 2pl/2, 2p3/z doublet is characteristic of the high spin cobalt(II) compounds [24]. The XPS spectra of catalysts No. 798, No. 808 and No. 810 ( calcined at 1000) (see Fig. 7) were similar. The traces 2, 3, and 4 all exhibited a small peak a few eV higher in BE than the Co 2p3/2 line. This feature can be attributed to a shake- up satellite [24]. No such peak was observed in trace 1 which is consistent with Co304 being present at the surface [25]. The surface concentration of cobalt on catalyst No. 810, calcined at 320 was twice as much as that for this catalyst calcined at 1000. The lower concentration of cobalt at the surface could be consistent with the formation of cobalt silicates at high temperatures. However, despite that the catalysts No. 798 and No. 808 were calcined at only 320 they exhibited also a low surface concentration of cobalt. This indicates that in the case of catalysts No. 798 and No. 808 there was a strong interaction between the cobalt species and the support. 4. Discussion The results demonstrate that catalytic activity, reduction behaviour and colour of a cobalt on silica gel catalyst, prepared by the direct solution impregnation method, depend strongly upon the initial pH of the solution. The interpretation of the results requires consideration of the nature of the silica gel-aqueous solution interface and the ion-exchange properties of the support. When silica gel is impregnated with an ionic solution, adsorption of ions is strongly affected by the surface charge. The protonation-deprotonation equilibria and adsorption of hydroxyl complexes derived from the hydrolysis products of partially dissolved silica gel affect the resultant concentration of the charged surface groups [ 17,18]. Both processes involve H+ and OH ions and thus are controlled by the pH of the solution. Previous studies have revealed that the pH of the aqueous solution, the type and strength of other ions, as well as the impurities present in the solid can all have substantial effects on the surface charge of silica gel [26,27]. The pH of the impregnating solution is the most important adjustable factor. For silica gel, a pH value defined as the point of zero charge (PZC) is between 2 and 3.5 [26,27 ]. Below the pH of the PZC, the surface of silica gel is positively charged. Since cobalt ions are positively charged in aqueous solution, such a surface does not favour adsorption. At pH above the PZC, deposition is enhanced. Silica gel at pH >/5 partially dissolves and ion exchange processes occur. This ion exchange may involve metallic ions directly substituting for silicon at the 34 H. Ming, B.G. Baker~Applied Catalysis A: General I23 (1995) 23-36 surface of silica gel to form new charged centres [ 17,18]. The mechanism of the deposition of cobalt ions can therefore be expected to depend strongly on pH. If the preparation of a cobalt-silica gel catalyst is carried out in a basic solution, it is possible that silicates may form. Catalyst No. 809 was prepared at pH = 1.8 at which the surface of silica gel is positively charged. Consequently, the deposited cobalt species were not well dis- persed at the silica gel surface. The TPR and XRD results demonstrate that cobalt oxide was present at the surface of this catalyst. Catalyst No. 810 was prepared at pH = 4.6 at which the silica gel surface is slightly negatively charged. In this case, the attraction forces favour adsorption of the positive cobalt ions. Consequently, cobalt is expected to be well dispersed at the surface. The activity of this catalyst was superior to No. 809. However, since the interaction of cobalt with the support is still fairly weak, the activity of the catalyst is decreased by calcination at 520. Catalysts No. 806 and No. 798 were prepared at pH at 5.0 and 6.3, respectively, using urea to form a complex. UV spectroscopy of these solutions indicated that cobalt was present as Co\". In this pH range, the cationic exchange between silica gel and cobalt ions present in the solution is a predominant process. The deposition mechanism involves a surface chemical reaction. The TPR, DTA and XPS results have suggested that the cobalt species present at the surface of those catalysts were silicates or hydrosilicates and their stability was dependent on the temperature of calcination. The composition of surface silicates was pH dependent. Both catalysts showed low F-T activity because their reducibility is low. The excess hydrogen consumed in the reduction of No. 798 is apparently associated with the decompo- sition of the urea complex. Catalyst No. 808 was prepared at pH = 10 using ethylenediamine as a complexing agent. Cobalt in the complex existed initially as Co2 + but it was quickly oxidized to Co3+. At this pH, partial surface dissolution of silica gel and ion-exchange processes are predominant. Consequently, the surface structure of silica gel can also be affected. The TPR, DTA and XPS results confirmed formation of cobalt silicates. The activity of this catalyst in the F-T synthesis was comparable to that of catalyst No. 810, even though only 26% of the cobalt was reduced during activation. The measurement of hydrogen adsorption on activated catalysts recorded in Table 4 and Fig. 3 correlate well with the catalytic activities. The catalysts which are reduced below 400 contain metallic cobalt. They adsorb hydrogen reversibly in the temperature range 100-300. The first peak ( < 200) in each trace of Fig. 3 is attributed to dissociative adsorption of hydrogen on cobalt. Previous studies of supported cobalt catalysts have shown that the adsorption of hydrogen is activated and reversible and that the maximum adsorption occurs above 100 [ 14,28,29]. The temperature of the maximum uptake in Fig. 3 is dependent on the rate of heating and occurs at lower temperature for slower rates. The same adsorption characteristic is observed for reduced cobalt oxide and to a small extent for No. 808 (Table 4). No such adsorption was observed for No. 806 and No. 798. H. Ming, B.G. Baker~Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995)23-36 35 The second peak of hydrogen adsorption above 200 is attributed to 'spillover' hydrogen on the silica support. This adsorption was not observed for reduced cobalt oxide but was strongly evident for No. 808 (Table 4). Many examples of the bonding of hydrogen on silica and other oxide supports by spillover following dissociative adsorption on a metal have been reviewed [30]. The effect has been observed on cobalt-alumina catalysts [ 31 ]. The process is activated and the exper- iments show that for cobalt-silica it is reversible. The migration of monohydrogen from the metal to the silica is believed to involve surface hydroxyl groups. The loss of the second peak (Fig. 3B, trace 4) after heating No. 810 to 500 is presumably due to loss of surface sites in the silica rather than to loss of cobalt. The experiments in which the cooling cycle was limited to ca. 120 showed no further uptake of hydrogen. This shows that both forms of adsorbed hydrogen are stable over the temperature range to 300. The catalytic behaviour shown in Table 2 can be explained in the following terms: No. 808 and No. 810 both contained metallic cobalt and spillover hydrogen; No. 810 had the better dispersion of cobalt. The activity of No. 810 was decreased by calcination at 520 because this destroyed spillover sites on the silica. The activity of No. 808 was high despite the relatively small amount of reducible cobalt because of the high content of spillover hydrogen. Both No. 808 and No. 798 were inactive because they did not contain reduced cobalt. 5. Conclusions The catalytic performance of a cobalt-silica gel F-T catalyst is strongly affected by preparation conditions. The pH of the impregnating solution is the most signif- icant parameter. For catalysts prepared at pH <5, cobalt is deposited onto the surface of silica gel mainly by adsorption. Dispersion of the adsorbed cobalt species is strongly affected by the surface charge. At pH < 2, the silica gel surface is positively charged and, consequently, cobalt is poorly dispersed. At pH = 2-5, when the surface of silica gel is negatively charged, adsorption is favoured and dispersion of cobalt enhanced. For catalysts prepared at pH/> 5, cobalt ions readily react with the surface of silica gel to form various cobalt silicates or hydrosilicates. Because these are not reduced during activation, the amount of metallic cobalt available for the F-T synthesis is small, so the activity of the catalyst is low. Active catalysts were shown to adsorb hydrogen at the reduction temperature. Spillover hydrogen on the silica support has been identified as an important char- acteristic of the reactive catalyst.

The effect of preparation conditions on cobalt-silica gel catalysts has been investigated by temperature-programmed reduction, differential thermal analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The results have been correlated with the performance of the catalysts for the conversion of syngas. It has been found that active Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) cobalt catalysts can be partially or totally reduced to the metal phase during activation. However, reducibility of the catalysts is a necessary but not sufficient characteristic in ensuring good activity. The pH of the impregnating solution influences surface charge and solubility of silica gel. Consequently, the physical and chemical properties of the cobalt species on the surface of silica gel are strongly affected by this parameter. At pH<5 cobalt deposits as a cation. At pH<2 the silica surface is positively charged so that the dispersion of cobalt and consequently catalytic activity are poor. At pH≥5, cobalt reacts to form silicates or hydrosilicates which are irreducible. Active catalysts are shown to adsorb hydrogen by spillover on to the silica support.
