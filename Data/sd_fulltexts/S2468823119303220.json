Graphical abstract A novel partial graphitic carbon was prepared and showed excellent catalytic performance of selective aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane in liquid phase with a conversion of 54.8% and a selectivity of 44.4% towards KA oil after reaction at 125 °C for 8 h. A novel partially graphitic carbon catalyst was developed and used in the aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane to KA oil (cyclohexanol A= and K=cyclohexanone) in liquid phase. Excellent catalytic performance was achieved and the conversion of cyclohexane reached 54.8% with a high selectivity of 44.4% to KA oil at 125 °C for 8 h. The characterizations and control experiment results shows that the co-existence of the graphitic structure and amorphous part is crucial to this excellent performance. Keywords Partially graphitic carbon Aerobic oxidation Cyclohexane KA oil 1 Introduction The selective oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanone (K) and cyclohexanol (A), usually referred as KA-oil, is of extreme importance in the chemical industry. Cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol are important intermediates in the manufacture of Nylon-6 and Nylon-66 polymers [1]. In particular, cyclohexanone is the key feedstock in producing caprolactam, the monomer of Nylon-66 [2], which illustrates that a higher K/A ratio is more desirable in industry. To date, the biggest challenge in commercial processes is the difficulty of controlling the selectivity, since both cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol are easier to be oxidized compared to cyclohexane. In industry, the per-pass conversion of cyclohexane is usually controlled below 5% to prevent the over-oxidation [3]. This thereby causes the problems of low efficiency and high energy consumption. Many catalysts have been designed to catalyze cyclohexane selective oxidation. For example, transition metal salts [4–6] containing Co, Cr, Mn, and metalloporphyrins have been widely investigated due to their ability in accelerating the initiation of the free radical chain reaction, called Haber-Weiss cycle [7]. However, the major disadvantage of homogeneous catalysis is the difficulty of separating and recycling. In addition, the wasted liquid containing used metal salts leads to serious environmental pollution. Heterogeneous catalysts are widely applied in chemical industry due to their uncomplicated separation with reactants, products or solvents. Several heterogeneous catalysts, such as metal oxides [8,9], zeolites [10–17], and supported metal catalysts [18–22] have been reported to be active, but the fact remains that activity and/or selectivity to KA oil is still far away from satisfaction. Recently, carbon materials as metal-free catalysts have attracted much attention due to their excellent catalytic performance in the activation of hydrocarbon, oxygen, and CO2, as well as their specific advantages over metal catalysts, namely, low cost, easy production, high acid/base resistance, and high mechanical stability [23–32]. Wang et al. reported that a B/F-doped carbon can efficiently catalyze the oxidation of cyclohexane with H2O2 as the oxidant [28]. Nitrogen-doped CNTs was further investigated for the aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane and the conversion can reach 45.3%, indicating its high activity [29]. But the selectivity towards KA oil was very low at 26.7%. Herein, we demonstrate that a novel partially graphitic carbon (denoted as PGC) as a new class of quasi metal-free catalyst, which was prepared easily by a one-pot hydrothermal treatment and subsequently carbonization, can afford an excellent performance in the aerobic oxidation. With O2 as the oxidant, a cyclohexane conversion of 54.8% and a KA oil selectivity of 44.4% are obtained. These results show that PGC is an effective catalyst in cyclohexane selective oxidation. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Glucose, resorcinol, cyclohexane, acetonitrile, cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone were purchased from Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Cobalt nitrate hydrate was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All above chemicals were in AR grade and used without further treatment. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs, containing Fe 870 ppm, Co <5 ppm, Ni 1100 ppm and Mn 41 ppm, which was determined by ICP), activated carbon (AC), acetylene black (AB), and graphene (containing Fe 380 ppm, Co <10 ppm, Ni <10 ppm, which was determined by ICP) were purchased from Nanjing XFNANO Co., Ltd. 2.2 The synthesis of PGC catalyst In a typical case, glucose (4 g), resorcinol (4 g), deionized water (10 g), and cobalt nitrate hydrate (2 g) were dissolved in deionized water (10 g) and kept under stirring to form an optically transparent solution. Then, NaOH aqueous solution was dropped into the mixed solution until the pH value was 7. After that, the neutral solution was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 180 °C for 24 h. The resulting product was washed, dried at 90 °C overnight and calcined at 1000 °C for 4 h in nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, a PGC monolith catalyst was obtained. 2.3 Catalysts characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was obtained on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å), operated at 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured at −196 °C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 M sorption analyser. The BET method was used to calculate the specific surface area. TEM images are obtained with FEI Tecnai 20 S-TWIN operating at 200 kV. Raman spectra were recorded on a Renishaw Raman spectrometer under ambient conditions. The thermo gravimetric (TGA) analysis was performed concurrently over PerkinElmer Pyris Diamond TG/DTA analyser, the sample (3–5 mg) was heated in air at a rate of 10 °C/min from 50 to 800 °C. The metal content was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) on an Agilent 725ES. 2.4 The catalytic activity test In a typical reaction, cyclohexane (9.36 g), acetonitrile (8 g), cyclohexanone (0.3 g, as the initiator), and catalyst PGC (0.05 g) were introduced into a 100 mL autoclave. After the reactor was purged with O2 for three times, 1.5 MPa O2 was charged. Then the reactor was heated to 125 °C. The total reaction time is 8 h. The organic phase was qualitatively analysed by a GC–MS (Agilent 7890A-5975C) equipped with an HP-5 column and quantitatively analysed by GC-FID (Agilent 7890A). Toluene was taken as the internal standard. The catalyst was recovered by centrifuging, washing with ethanol and drying for the recycle test. 3 Result and discussion The catalyst was prepared by a hydrothermal carbonization [33,34] of a mixture of glucose/resorcinol/cobalt salts, following by a subsequent pyrolysis at high temperature. Thus-prepared catalyst PGC exhibited monolithic form as shown in Fig. 1 a (insert) and its surface area is 347.8 m2 g−1. The monolithic form is favorable in the industrial applications. The XRD pattern of PGC in Fig. 2 a shows that there is a sharp peak at 26°, indicating the formation of graphite. The Raman spectra (Fig. 2b) also illustrate the PGC sample contains graphitic phase. The TEM images in Fig. 1 also show that PGC catalyst is a homogeneous composite containing amorphous structure with graphitic counterpart. The graphite was formed with the assistance of cobalt. The catalytic performance of PGC in the aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane was investigated in a batch reactor. As comparisons, several other common carbon materials, such as carbon-nanotubes (CNTs), activated carbon (AC), acetylene black (AB), and graphene were also studied. All these results as well as some reported results are summarized in Table 1 . It can be seen that AC catalyst (No. 3) showed the lowest cyclohexane conversion compared to other carbons. Graphene (No. 2), a basic unit of graphite, exhibited a moderate catalytic activity with a conversion of 10.7%. A better result was obtained on CNTs catalyst (No. 4) with a conversion of 26.7%, which is similar to the literature reported (No. 6). Interestingly, PGC catalyst, a homogeneous composite containing amorphous structured carbon with graphitic counterpart, showed the highest activity with a conversion of 41.7% (8 h), remarkably higher than those of all other selected carbons, including CNTs, N-CNTs, acetylene black, and graphene, as well as, CoAPO [11], FeAlPO [15] and supported Au catalyst [19]. It is well known that cobalt is active in this reaction and we therefore sought to investigate the influence of cobalt. In order to remove the cobalt in PGC, the catalyst was treated with 2 M HCl solution under stirring for 24 h. Fig. 3 displays the TG curves for as-prepared PGC and treated PGC by HCl leaching. The as-prepared PGC catalyst still kept 1.8% of its initial weight after being treated at 800 °C in air, indicating that there was residual cobalt in PGC catalyst. After being treated by HCl leaching, the PGC catalyst was almost burned out completely, revealing that the residual cobalt in catalyst was removed. It is consistent with the ICP result, which shows that the Co content in these two samples was 0.73% and 0.0094%, respectively. The treated PGC catalyst (PGC-HCl) was used in cyclohexane oxidation in the same condition with that of PGC. As shown in Table 2 , the cyclohexane conversion and total KA oil selectivity decreased slightly over PGC-HCl catalyst. In order to certify the function of cobalt, Raney Co was employed as a catalyst in this reaction. It exhibited a low conversion of 16.6% and a high KA oil selectivity of 61.2%. Although the cobalt-only catalyst shows a very low activity, it seems that the co-existence of cobalt and PGC promotes the conversion and selectivity. However, one more important issue needs to be pay attention is the effect to the PGC surface properties during the treatment by HCl leaching. On the one hand, the residue of HCl may affect the performance. We treated PGC-HCl with an aqueous solution of NaOH for 24 h, washed and dried (noted as PGC-HCl-NaOH). Interestingly, the conversion recovered and reached 38.2%, which was slightly lower than that of PGC, indicating the influence of HCl. On the other hand, it is reported the Lewis basic sites is responsible for the activation of hydrocarbons in the oxidation [23,24]. During leaching cobalt by HCl, the basic sites on the surface of PGC may be decreased or disappeared, resulting in a lower activity. This phenomenon is also found in previous report [29], in which the activity of CNT decreased after being treated with nitric acid. It is further indicated that the carbon component is the main active species in this reaction. Besides PGC, CNTs displayed the highest activity among the selected carbon materials. Thus, CNTs was selected as the reference material to investigate the catalytic behavior of PGC. Fig. 4 A and B displays the time profile of PGC and CNTs under identical reaction conditions, respectively. It can be seen that the change of the conversion of cyclohexane and the selectivity of KA oil with time were significantly different between PGC and CNTs. Despite of the fact that the initial reaction rate in the first 4 h is very similar on both catalysts, the conversion of cyclohexane on PGC is much higher than that on CNTs with prolonging reaction time. After 8 h on stream, the conversion of cyclohexane on PGC reached 41.7%, whereas the conversion on CNTs is only 26.7%. More surprisingly, the selectivity profiles are quite different between PGC and CNTs. For instance, the selectivity of adipic acid (AA) was only 14% on PGC after 6 h reaction, while much higher AA selectivity of ˜45% was obtained on CNTs. For the KA oil, the highest selectivity of 64.6% was obtained after 2 h reaction on CNTs with a conversion of 9% as seen from Fig. 4B, afterwards the selectivity dropped sharply. After 8 h, the selectivity towards KA oil only remained 36.9% with a conversion of 26.7%. On the other hand, the selectivity of KA oil on PGC quickly rose to 66.1% after 2 h and then reached the maximum of 73.2% after 4 h and afterwards it decreased slightly when the reaction time was further increased. Even the conversion was up to 43.4% after 10 h, the selectivity was still as high as 41.7%. Furthermore, the selectivity to cyclohexanone only varied slightly in a long reaction time over PGC as seen from Fig. 4A. This indicates that cyclohexanone is relatively stable on this catalytic system and PGC may considerably suppress the over-oxidation of cyclohexanone to adipic acid. The K/A (cyclohexanone to cyclohexanol) ratio value at reaction time of 8 h was much higher on PGC than that on other selected materials as shown in Table 1, probably due to the accumulation of cyclohexanone. In order to certify that the PGC catalyst gave a high K/A ratio by suppress the over oxidation of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone, we have carried out a series of experiments, in which cyclohexanol or cyclohexanone was employed as the reactant. As shown in Table 3 , the conversion of cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone was much lower on PGC than that on CNTs. It is consistent with that the PGC catalyst gave a higher KA oil selectivity in the selective oxidation of cyclohexane. To understand the remarkable enhancement of the catalytic performance on PGC, the influence of the reaction parameters was investigated. It was found that the oxygen pressure had a great influence on the catalytic activity. This demonstrates that the adsorption and activation of oxygen may be of great importance in this aerobic oxidation. It was reported that CNTs and N-doped CNTs can efficiently activate oxygen molecules in oxygen-involved reactions [23–28]. This may be the reason of the high conversions in the aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane (No. 4, 6, 7 in Table 1). On the other hand, AC as an amorphous carbon material hardly possesses the catalytic property in this reaction as mentioned above. This comparison suggests that the graphitic part of PGC may account for the activation of oxygen and afterwards the generation/stabilization of free radicals. To confirm this, a series of PGC catalysts were prepared with diverse carbonization temperature to tune the graphitic degree. As shown in Table 4 , the increase of carbonization temperature enhanced the graphitic degree as indicated by ID/IG value calculated from Raman spectra. The higher graphitic degree improved the conversion of cyclohexane, further confirmed that the graphitic part in PGC can significantly affect the activity. Moreover, a reference sample (RS), which was prepared similarly to PGC but without adding cobalt salts and mainly possessed amorphous structure, only displayed 14.3% conversion. All these results illustrate that the catalytic activity is dominated by the content/degree of the graphitic structure. Obviously, the enhancement of the selectivity is not due to the graphitic structure since graphene and CNTs did not give high selectivity to KA oils. It should be noted that PGC is a composite with both graphitic and amorphous phases, therefore we assumed that the amorphous part may play an important role for the high selectivity. Taking account of the fact that porous/amorphous carbons generally possess high adsorption ability due to their abundant pores as well as AC (amorphous structure only) hardly catalyzed the oxidation of cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone to adipic acid (Table 3), we proposed a possible mechanism as shown in Scheme 1 . Firstly, the graphitic part of PGC adsorbs and activates the oxygen to generate active oxygenate-species. Then these oxygenate-species subsequently reacted with the adsorbed cyclohexane molecules on the neighbor amorphous part to produce KA oil. Because the amorphous structure may hardly cause the over-oxidation, the high selectivity is obtained on PGC. However, it cannot be eliminated that a small amount of cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone as well as adipic acid may be formed on the graphitic part. To verify the proposed mechanism, we carried out following experiments. A physical mixture of CNT and one of three types of AC (AC-1, AC-2 and AC-3) was used as the catalyst instead of a single component. As shown in Table 5 , both conversion and selectivity were improved when 25 mg of AC plus 25 mg of CNT to substitute 50 mg of CNT as the catalyst. It should be noted all three kinds of AC display enhanced selectivity in this reaction, indicating the importance of amorphous porous carbons. This suggests that the mechanism above is reasonable. However, it should be kept in mind that the catalytic activities of these ‘physical mixtures’ are still far away from that of PGC, possibly because the homogeneous distribution of graphitic and amorphous structure generates more interface between them in PGC. The stability of the catalyst is crucial for the industrial application and thereby the recycling ability of PGC was also tested. As shown in Fig. 5 , after five cycling tests, the activity and the selectivity slightly decreased. The decrease may be explained by the change in surface chemistry during the reaction. It should be noted even after 5 runs, the performance of PGC is still slightly higher than that of CNTs. 4 Conclusion A novel partial graphitic carbon catalyst was prepared by a hydrothermal carbonization of a mixture of glucose/resorcinol/cobalt salt and subsequent pyrolysis. The degree of graphitization can be tuned by the temperature of carbonization. This material showed excellent catalytic performance of selective aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane in the liquid phase with a conversion of 54.8%, a selectivity of 44.4% towards KA oil after reaction at 125 °C for 8 h. Further study shows that the co-existence of graphitic structure and amorphous counterpart as well as the residual cobalt may account for the excellent catalytic activity. It is concluded that the co-existence of the graphitic structure and amorphous part is crucial to this excellent performance. Owing to its high activity, excellent selectivity, and good recyclability, PGC is a promising catalyst for aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane as well as other aerobic oxidation processes. More importantly, this catalyst is quite favorable in industrial application due to its easy preparation, and monolithic form, as well as its high resistance against pipeline fouling.
