DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60361-6 ARTICLE Liquid Phase Oxidation of Acetophenone over Rice Husk Silica Vanadium Catalyst Farook ADAM*, Thiam-Seng CHEW, Jeyashelly ANDAS School of Chemical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang 11800, Malaysia Abstract: Rice husk silica catalyst loaded with 10 wt% vanadium was synthesized from agricultural biomass via a sol-gel synthetic route at pH = 9. The catalyst was characterized by different physico-chemical methods. The FTIR spectra showed the formation of Siâ€“Oâ€“V and V=O stretching bands. The presence of vanadium was confirmed by EDX elemental analysis. RH-10V possessed a high specific surface area of 276 m 2 /g and pore volume of 0.83 ml/g. The prepared catalyst possessed a narrow pore size distribution centered around 7.9 nm. The catalytic performance of RH-10V was tested in the oxidation of acetophenone at 70 Â°C. RH-10V was found to be an active catalyst in the oxidation of acetophenone, producing 36.28% conversion efficiency. The products identified were benzoic acid, 2-hydroxyacetophenone, phenol, acetic acid, and 3-hydroxyacetophenone. Key words: vanadium; rice husk silica; oxidation; acetophenone; sol-gel technique Acetophenone is an asymmetric ketone and its oxidation results in the formation of a mixture of products such as ben- zoic acid, benzoylformic acid, dibenzoylfunzan 2-oxide, ben- zyl alcohol, and phenol which have well-established industrial applications [1â€“5]. For example, benzoic acid is used as plas- ticizer, as a food preservative, in flavoring, in the synthesis of perfumes and antifungal agents [6]. Phenol is widely used to produce phenolic resin, solvents, dyes, and pharmaceuticals [7]. Nevertheless, only few researchers [1â€“5] have studied the oxidation of acetophenone. This is presumably due to aceto- phenone being a terminal ketone which has no hydrogen atoms on the carbinol carbon. Thus, oxidation of acetophenone can only be possible by breaking the carbon-carbon bond [8]. Perkin [1] has reported the conversion of acetophenone to benzoic acid using sodium hypochlorite, which is the haloform reaction. However, from an environmental point of view, this method is not suitable for industrial use due to the formation of chloroform as a side product. Homogeneous catalystV such as 1,3-dinitrobenzene [2] and nitric acid [3] have been used to oxidize acetophenone. These homogeneous systems create problems in the separation process and catalyst recovery. Hence, Chumbahale and co-workers [4] have reported the vapor phase oxidation of acetophenone by V 2 O 5 -MoO 3 catalyst resulting in the formation of maleic anhydride, benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, and phthalic anhydride. They have also observed trace amounts of toluene, xylene, and phenol as by-products. Although this method manages to achieve high selectivity toward benzoic acid, it needs high temperature and long contact times which are limitations. Vanadium shows a wide range of oxidation states (+2 to +5) in aqueous solution. Moreover, heterogeneous vanadium catalysts have been used in various oxidation reactions [9â€“11]. To the best of our knowledge, the oxidation of acetophenone has not been carried out using catalyst synthesized from bio- mass rice husk (RH) silica. Since RH silica exhibits high sur- face area and high porosity [12], it is thought to be advanta- geous to prepare vanadium incorporated RH silica and evaluate the synthesized catalyst in the oxidation of acetophenone with aqueous hydrogen peroxide under mild conditions. This work describes the simplest, cost-effective, and green preparation of RH-vanadium catalyst for the liquid-phase oxidation of ace- tophenone. 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation of sodium silicate Farook ADAM et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 518â€“522 Preparation of sodium silicate was carried out by a modifi- cation of the technique reported by Adam and Chew [13]. The dried RH (30.0 g) was stirred in 600 ml of 1.0 mol/L HNO 3 for 24 h to remove unwanted metal. The acid treated RH was filtered and washed with copious amount of distilled water until it reached a constant pH. It was oven dried at 383 K overnight. On cooling, the rice husk (RH-HNO 3 ) was weighed. The RH-HNO 3 was stirred in 500 ml of 1.0 mol/L NaOH for 24 h. The mixture was suction filtered to obtain sodium silicate to be used as the silica source. The recovered residue (RH-NaOH) was washed with distilled water and dried in an oven at 383 K and the mass of RH-NaOH weighed. The difference in the mass between RH-HNO 3 and RH-NaOH was assumed to be equivalent to the mass of silica extracted. 1.2 Preparation of RH-10V catalyst The resulting sodium silicate was titrated slowly (ca. 1.0 ml/min) to pH = 9 with 150 ml of 3.0 mol/L HNO 3 containing 2.03 g of NaVO 3 H 2 O to get 10 wt% of vanadium in the cata- lyst. A brown gel was obtained and aged for 48 h. The gel was suction filtered, washed thoroughly with distilled water, and followed by hot water several times in order to remove Na + , and oven dried at 383 K for 24 h. The powder was allowed to cool in a desiccator and ground into fine powder and the sam- ple denoted as RH-10V was kept for further use. 1.3 Catalyst characterization RH-10V was characterized by FTIR spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer System 2000), N 2 adsorption-desorption analysis (Mi- cromeritics Instrument Corporation model ASAP 2000, Nor- cross), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Phillips CM12), energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS, Edax Falcon System) and DR/UV-Vis analysis (Lambda 35, Perkin Elmer). 1.4 Catalytic activity As a common practice, prior to the reaction, RH-10V (50 mg) was activated for 24 h in an oven at 383 K. The catalyst was removed from the oven and cooled in a desiccator prior to use in the catalysis. The round-bottom flask equipped with a condenser was set up in a temperature control oil bath at 343 K. Acetophenone (2.40 g) in 10 ml of acetonitrile was placed into the flask. H 2 O 2 (4.53 g, 30%) was added drop wise into the reaction vessel within 5 min. The reaction was allowed to run for 3 h. During the reaction, 0.5 ml of the sample was with- drawn and filtered, then 10 l of cyclohexane was added as internal standard and analyzed by gas chromatography (Perkin Elmer Clarus 500) equipped with Elite Wax (30 m Ã— 0.2 mm ID) and further confirmed by GCMS (Perkin Elmer, Clarus 600) analysis. The following are the GC and GCMS condition used: initial oven temperature = 383 K, final oven temperature = 503 K, ramp 1 = 20 K/min to 403 K, ramp 2 = 10 K/min to 503 K, total run time = 11 min. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Characterization of catalyst The infrared spectra of RH-10V before and after reaction are illustrated in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1(1), the band at 3462 cm â€“1 was either due to the Oâ€“H stretching vibration of the silanol or adsorbed water molecules on the silica surface. The band at 1639 cm â€“1 was due to the bending vibration of the water molecules. The strong band at 1096 cm â€“1 corresponded to the asymmetric vibration of the siloxane bond Siâ€“Oâ€“Si, and the band at 805 cm â€“1 was assigned to the bending vibration of Siâ€“Oâ€“Si bond. The transmission band observed at 472 cm â€“1 was due to the stretching vibration of the Siâ€“Oâ€“Si bond. The presence of a band at 974 cm â€“1 indicated the Siâ€“OH stretching vibration in the parent silica reported in our previous study [15]. When H was exchanged with metal, in this case vana- dium, an obvious shift of this band could be observed. There- fore, in RH-10V, the observed Siâ€“OV vibration was shifted to 974 cm â€“1 due to the exchange of the H with V. Thus, it was possible to conclude that the band at 974 cm â€“1 in the vanadium containing catalyst was due to the presence of Siâ€“OV bonds [14]. Moreover, the shoulder at ~1024 cm â€“1 was assigned to the V=O stretching vibration as reported by Gomez et al. [16] for vanadia- zirconia catalyst. The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of RH-10V (Fig. 2) shows type IV isotherms and H1 hysteresis loops. H1 hystere- sis loop is a characteristic of mesoporous material consisting of agglomerates or spherical particles having a relatively uni- form pore size [16]. The specific surface area of RH-10V was found to be 276 m 2 /g, and the pore volume was 0.83 ml/g. The catalyst showed a narrow pore size distribution in the range of 5â€“8 nm which is in accordance with the characteristics of H1 4000 3500 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 (1) (2) 2979 472 805 974 1096 1226 1639 3462 T r a n s m i t t a n c e Wavenumber (cm 1 ) Fig. 1.

The incor- poration of V resulted in smaller particles. The elemental composition of RH-10V was determined by EDX analysis as represented in Table 1 which confirmed the presence of carbon, oxygen, silicon, and vanadium. Si and O were detected due to the formation of siloxane bond (Siâ€“Oâ€“Si) and silanol group (Siâ€“OH). These Si and O could form a Siâ€“Oâ€“V bond, whereas the presence of small amount of carbon might arise from rice husk. The DR/UV-Vis spectrum of the vanadium containing cata- lyst (Fig. 4) showed a strong band centered at 278 nm. This band could be assigned as V 5+ in tetrahedral coordination [17]. The band around 330â€“500 nm region was due to the octahedral coordinated V 5+ [18]. In this case, the dâ€“d transitions were also observed between 650 and 700 nm [17]. Thus, it could be concluded that vanadium was present solely as V 5+ in the framework of silica. 2.2 Catalyst evaluation The prepared catalyst was tested in the liquid phase oxida- tion of acetophenone. Table 2 shows the acetophenone con- version with respect to the mass of the catalyst at 343 K. The acetophenone conversion was found to increase sharply from 11.4% to 36.3% when the catalyst mass used was increased from 30 to 50 mg. However, further increase in the catalyst mass to 100 mg resulted in a decrease in acetophenone con- version to 12.6%. This was due to the rapid decomposition of H 2 O 2 over the large surface area available with a higher amount of catalyst [19]. At a higher dose of catalyst, the availability of more active sites resulted in rapid decomposition of H 2 O 2 , leading to lower yields. As a result, 2-hydroxyacetophenone was observed as a by-product and decreased the selectivity of benzoic acid. The reaction temperature was found to have a great influ- Table 1 The elemental composition of RH-10V Elemental Average weight (%) C 2.1 O 69.1 Si 23.4 V 5.4 Total 100.0 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 A b s o r b a n c e Wavelength (nm) Fig. 4.

Farook ADAM et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 518â€“522 ence on the conversion of the reaction. Thus, in the oxidation of acetophenone, the effect of temperature on the reaction was studied in the range of 303â€“353 K (Table 3). With an increase in the reaction temperature from 303 to 343 K, there was a significant increase in the conversion from 24.3% to 36.3%. Raising the reaction temperature higher to 353 K resulted in a slight increase of the conversion to 39.2%. This was due to the rapid decomposition of H 2 O 2 at 353 K [12]. Moreover, the selectivity toward 2-acetophenone increased with increasing temperature, this might be due to the formation of water from H 2 O 2 to hydrolyze acetophenone. However, decomposition of H 2 O 2 caused lack of oxidant to convert acetophenone into benzoic acid and acetic acid. Even though there was increase in conversion with temperature, the optimum reaction tempera- ture was set at 343 K, because at high temperatures, there are moderate conversion and rapid decomposition of H 2 O 2 . The effect of H 2 O 2 was studied by varying acetophenone: H 2 O 2 molar ratio from 1:1 to 1:3 (Table 4). The conversions were 4.1% and 36.3% for 1:1 and 1:2 molar ratios, respectively. However, at a molar ratio of 1:3, the acetophenone conversion decreased. Generally, the decomposition of H 2 O 2 produced water as the by-product. The water might poison the catalyst by adsorbing strongly to the vanadium centre and thus inhibiting the reaction [18]. Furthermore, decomposition of H 2 O 2 (oxi- dant) reduced the formation of acetic acid and benzoic acid, while the hydroxylation product, 2-acetophenone was easily formed in the presence of water. It was thus concluded that the optimum molar ratio was 1:2. From the data in Tables 3 and 4, phenol was only detected at 353 K when the acetophenone:H 2 O 2 molar ratio was 1:3. The formation of phenol must originate from the breaking of the bond as shown in Scheme 1. While acetic acid was detected under all the experimental conditions studied, it was not clear why phenol was only detected under certain conditions as noted above. It was concluded that this anomaly required fur- ther investigation. After optimization of the reaction conditions it resulted in 36.28% conversion of acetophenone yielding 20.4% acetic acid, 19.8% benzoic acid, 49.2% 2-hydroxyacetophenone, and 10.6% 3-hydroxyacetophenone. In previous studies, 1,3-dinitrobenzene [2] had been used as the solvent for this reaction and by adding t-BuOK, a conversion of 91.7% ace- tophenone and 58.2% yield of benzoic acid were achieved. However, the utilization of t-BuOK as an additive is expensive for the industrial production of benzoic acid and secondly, the homogeneous system creates problem for separation. Some researchers [3,5] used acid catalyst in a two-step oxidation of acetophenone by forming -nitroso-acetophenone as the in- termediate. However, the intermediate formed is unstable in acidic condition and isomerizes to form benzoylformaldehyde oxime as a by-product. Hence, the two-step oxidation of ace- tophenone is not practical in the industry due to the difficulty in isolating the products and the lengthy time involved. Chum- bahale et al. [4] used vapor phase oxidation of acetophenone over a long contact time (58.5 h) to obtain a high conversion (74.8%) and high selectivity (96.9%) towards benzoic acid. However, this method yielded side-products such as maleic anhydride, benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, phthalic anhydride, and other unidentified products. It is quite clear that RH-10V is by far a better catalyst for the oxidation of acetophenone and to break the Câ€“C single bond to the carbonyl group. To test the catalyst reusability, RH-10V was used consecu- tively for 3 cycles as shown in Table 5. The used catalyst was filtered and regenerated by heating at 383 K for 24 h. After 3 runs, there was a decrease in conversion (17.7%).

Farook ADAM et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 518â€“522 catalyst was subjected to FT-IR analysis as depicted in Fig. 1(2). The appearance of the vibration at 2979 cm â€“1 in the FT-IR spectrum of the used catalyst might be due to adsorption of the organic compounds on the catalyst surface. This showed that the temperature for regeneration is not enough for removing the adsorbed organic compounds which resulted in catalyst poisoning. Hence some active sites of the catalyst had been blocked by the organic products and thereby lowering the catalytic activity. The objective of the present study did not involve any attempt to remove the organics, however, further work is in progress to remove organics adsorbed on the catalyst so that its efficiency can be improved. 3 Conclusions In summary, a template-free vanadium-silica catalyst was successfully synthesized from RH via a simple sol-gel and solvent extraction techniques. The catalyst was developed in a simple, cost-effective, and green procedure to investigate the liquid phase oxidation of acetophenone. RH-10V was found to be more active to break the Câ€“C single bond to the carbonyl group compared with the catalysts published in the literature. The preparation of the catalyst does not involve calcination which reduces the demand on the energy necessary in the synthesis. This study have benefits to both academic and in- dustry for alternative methods to break the Câ€“C bond linking the -carbon connected to the carbonyl carbon in ketones. Further studies are in progress in our group to improve the reusability of RH-10V by removing the organics adsorbed on the catalyst. References 1 Perkin R.

Farook ADAM et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 518â€“522 catalyst was subjected to FT-IR analysis as depicted in Fig. 1(2). The appearance of the vibration at 2979 cm â€“1 in the FT-IR spectrum of the used catalyst might be due to adsorption of the organic compounds on the catalyst surface. This showed that the temperature for regeneration is not enough for removing the adsorbed organic compounds which resulted in catalyst poisoning. Hence some active sites of the catalyst had been blocked by the organic products and thereby lowering the catalytic activity. The objective of the present study did not involve any attempt to remove the organics, however, further work is in progress to remove organics adsorbed on the catalyst so that its efficiency can be improved. 3 Conclusions In summary, a template-free vanadium-silica catalyst was successfully synthesized from RH via a simple sol-gel and solvent extraction techniques. The catalyst was developed in a simple, cost-effective, and green procedure to investigate the liquid phase oxidation of acetophenone. RH-10V was found to be more active to break the Câ€“C single bond to the carbonyl group compared with the catalysts published in the literature. The preparation of the catalyst does not involve calcination which reduces the demand on the energy necessary in the synthesis. This study have benefits to both academic and in- dustry for alternative methods to break the Câ€“C bond linking the -carbon connected to the carbonyl carbon in ketones. Further studies are in progress in our group to improve the reusability of RH-10V by removing the organics adsorbed on the catalyst. References 1 Perkin R.

Tel: +60-46533567; Fax: +60-46574854 Rice husk silica catalyst loaded with 10 wt% vanadium was synthesized from agricultural biomass via a sol-gel synthetic route at pH = 9. The catalyst was characterized by different physico-chemical methods. The FTIR spectra showed the formation of Si–O–V and V=O stretching bands. The presence of vanadium was confirmed by EDX elemental analysis. RH-10V possessed a high specific surface area of 276 m2/g and pore volume of 0.83 ml/g. The prepared catalyst possessed a narrow pore size distribution centered around 7.9 nm. The catalytic performance of RH-10V was tested in the oxidation of acetophenone at 70 °C. RH-10V was found to be an active catalyst in the oxidation of acetophenone, producing 36.28% conversion efficiency. The products identified were benzoic acid, 2-hydroxyacetophenone, phenol, acetic acid, and 3-hydroxyacetophenone.
