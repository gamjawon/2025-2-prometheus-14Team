Graphical abstract Upgrading of bio-oil through catalytic hydrotreating was investigated with anisole as a model compound. Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites with nano-crystalline structure were successfully synthesized by a segmented steam-assisted crystallization method by tuning the rate of crystallization during the phase transforming between the amorphous structure and crystalline structure without using the organic template. The diffusional properties of ZSM-5 samples were investigated by catalytic cracking of 1,3,5-TIPB. Ni/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts displayed an excellent performance in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of biomass-derived anisole to cyclohexane in comparison with conventional Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst. The activity and selectivity were significantly improved by enhancing the accessibility of acidities. Anisole HDO mainly follows the anisole to benzene with metal sites by direct deoxygenation, then cyclohexane formed by hydrogenation. Keywords Hydrodeoxygenation Anisole Hierarchical zeolite Nickel 1 Introduction Bio-oils are potential alternatives to fossil-based fuels, which can be produced sustainably from renewable feedstocks [1–3]. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is a catalytic conversion that could remove oxygen primarily in the form of water at high H2 partial pressure [4–7]. HDO can effectively remove the methoxy group (−OCH3) in phenolic compounds and convert them to high quality bio-oils [8–10]. Conventional Co–Mo sulfide and noble based catalysts have been investigated for HDO using these model compounds because these phenolic CO bonds could be broken with temperatures ranging from 523 to 560 K [11,12]. Zeolites are widely used in many industrial processes, for its high thermal/hydrothermal stability, strong acidity, and shape selectivity [13–17]. Several zeolite-based catalysts have been developed to facilitate hydrodeoxygenation processes, and both precious and transition metals are selected as the active species [18–23]. Gamliel et al. [24] took a comparison study for the Pd and Ni supported on Y zeolite in anisole HDO reaction. Both of the two catalysts showed high selectivity for the deoxygenated products. However, Ni/Y zeolite was more selectivity for single-ringed cyclohexane. Pd/Y showed a cyclohexane selectivity of 57% and Ni/Y zeolite showed a cyclohexane selectivity of 71% at the pressure of 750 psi with the reaction temperature of 200 °C for 140 min. Sankaranarayanan et al. [25] have conducted pioneering and important work for HDO of anisole with Co and Ni based different mesoporous supports. Hierarchical ZSM-5 and mesoporous SBA-15 were used to disperse the metals. It was revealed that anisole conversion could be changed by different types of metals, and acidities in various supports played an important role in products selectivity. Co/ZSM-5 exhibited lower anisole conversion than Ni/ZSM-5 for the strong metal-support interaction between Co and zeolite. Different dispersion states of Ni were found on the three different supports duo to the different surface hydroxyl groups acidities. The products selectivity for Ni based catalysts would be changed with the supports, accordingly. The main products for the non-acidic SBA-15 supported Ni are phenol, cyclohexanol, cyclohexane, and cyclohexanone. The main products for the Ni/ZSM-5 with strong acidities are cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane suggesting the pathway of initial hydrogenation to benzene followed by saturation of aromatic ring. Lee et al. [26] demonstrated the necessity of using large pore size zeolite in HDO of phenol compounds. Due to the relatively large pore size, Pt/mesoporous Y zeolite selected a reaction pathway of hydrogenation of the aromatic ring and then followed by deoxygenation, which showed more selectivity to cyclohexane than Pt/ZSM-5 zeolite in the HDO of 2-methoxy phenol. Hierarchical zeolites with more accessible active sites and shorter diffusion length are more efficient than conventional zeolites in reactions such as cracking and hydrogenation [27–29]. Catalysts based on hierarchical zeolites are expected to be more activity in HDO process [11]. Gamliel et al. [19] prepared the Ni/USY catalyst with the size of Ni particle about 28 nm, and the catalyst achieved an anisole conversion of 53%. Mesoporous USY with hierarchical structure shows better activity which could lead to a high anisole conversion of 95 wt.% and the cyclohexane selectivity of 87.0%. Large nickel particles were easily dispersed on the support surface, which were considered as the active site for this reaction. Thereby, it is important to develop mesopores in zeolites with various structure and to study the distribution of products for the HDO process. Hierarchical zeolites with mesopores are commonly prepared by hydrothermal synthesis or post-synthetic route [30–35]. Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites developed by desilication which are versatility and efficient for industry application are already confirmed by some important reports [36–39]. Alternatively, some studies claimed it was possible to prepare hierarchical zeolites with the steam-assisted crystallization (SAC) method [40–42]. Based on the SAC method, hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites could be successfully synthesized with organic compounds as templates, including block copolymers, organosilanes, quaternary ammonia compounds, and organic cyclic diammonium [43–46]. However, lots of these SAC processes need the use of organic templates. Moreover, tuning the mesopore volume, together with achieving well preserved micropores pore system, is still a challenge. Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites with nano-crystalline (HSZ) show a novel structure combining the benefits of nano ZSM-5 and mesoporous ZSM-5, which are considered to have great industrial potential [47]. Additionally, the HSZ zeolites with the aggregation of nanosized zeolites, which can be easily separated from the mixture of reaction by filtration, are potential materials to overcome the limitations of traditional nano-ZSM-5 zeolite. Then it was promising to design bifunctional nickel-solid acid HDO catalysts by supporting a transition metal on a hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite with nano-crystallite for hydrodeoxygenation. As described in literature, the effect of mesopores on the selectivity and reaction pathway of HDO of anisole is still under debate [24–26]. Different from previous studies [25,26,48], nickel/ZSM-5 catalysts with similar Ni dispersion were prepared with different mesopores and different amount of acid sites in this study. Mesopores generated by the template free SAC method were found to be more accessible for the diffusion of large molecules. The methodology here applied provides the facilitate to study the synergistic effect between the accessibility of acidities and nickel metal for this reaction. Moreover, it is interesting to study the potential use of this newly developed mesoporous zeolite for HDO reactions. Here we take anisole, which has a methoxy group, as a typical model compound for lignin-derived model compounds. The effect of acidities and diffusional properties on anisole HDO over bi-functional Ni/ nano-crystallite self-assembled hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts were studied. The conversion and product selectivity for the hydrodeoxygenation of anisole for different catalysts at different reaction time and temperature were studied. Combining with the reactions of potential intermediates, the anisole reaction pathway was proposed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The ZSM-5 zeolite was synthesized according to the following procedure. The molar ratio for preparing hierarchical ZSM-5 was 1SiO2/0.013Al2O3/0.16 TPAOH/30 EtOH. Typically, 0.294 g Al(iPrO)3, 7.02 g TPAOH and 60 mL EtOH were mixed in beaker A for 30 min. At the same time, 12 mL TEOS and 46 mL EtOH were mixed in beaker B for 30 min. Then the mixture in beaker A was added dropwise to beaker B under stirring to get the precursor-aluminosilicate nanogels. The precursor-aluminosilicate nanogels was treated at 70 °C to obtain the concentrated nanogel. The concentrated nano-gel was then put into a smaller crucible, and transferred to a stainless-steel autoclave. To avoid direct contact with the concentrated nano-gel, deionized water (40 ml) was placed at the bottom of the Teflon sleeve. The autoclave was then sealed and hydrothermally treated at different temperature (140 °C or 180 °C) for different time (4 h, 24 h or 28 h). After the SAC process was quenched, the obtained sample was washed and filtered. Then the sample was dried at 80 °C and calcined at 550 °C for 5 h. The resultant zeolite was denoted as HSZ through the SAC temperature (°C) and SAC time (h). HSZ-a represents the sample prepared at 140 °C for 28 h, and HSZ-b represents the material synthesized firstly at 140n°C with 24 h, further at 180 °C with 4 h. HSZ-c represents the materials synthesized at 180 °C for 4 h and then 140 °C for 24 h. Zeolites supported nickel catalysts (with 5 wt% Ni loading) were prepared via the incipient wetness technique with aqueous solutions of nickel nitrate and then were dried. After impregnation, samples were calcined at 500 °C for 2 h. Finally, the obtained catalysts are denoted as Ni/HSZ catalysts. The commercial ZSM-5 (SINOPEC Corp.) was ion-exchanged with NH4NO3 solution three times to obtain NH4ZSM-5. After drying, the NH4ZSM-5 was calcined to prepare HZSM-5. The meso-HZSM-5 was prepared by the common desilication process described by literature [34] with 0.4 M NaOH for 30 min followed by the NH4-ion-exhange process. The reference catalysts 5 wt% Ni/ HZSM-5 and Ni/mseo-HZSM-5 were obtained with impregnation using HZSM-5 zeolite as the support. 2.2 Catalytic cracking of 1,3,5-TIPB The catalytic cracking of 1,3,5-tri-iso-propylbenzene (1,3,5-TIPB) was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor with an inner diameter of 8 mm. 0.1 g zeolite (40–60 mesh) was loaded into the reactor and activated at 500 °C in N2 flow of 50 ml/min for 2 h. The reaction was performed at 450 °C in in a N2 flow of 20 mL/min at atmospheric pressure. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was 4.0 or 8.0 h−1. The product analysis was conducted by GC (Agilent 7890) equipped with an FID detector. 2.3 Hydrodeoxygenation of anisole A high-pressure batch reactor was used to perform the reaction of anisole hydrodeoxygenation at 120∼200 °C and 6.8 MPa total pressure for 10∼140 min with constant stirring. Before the test, the samples were reduced ex-situ in a tubular at 550 °C for 3 h in a flow of 5 mol.% of H2 in N2 under atmospheric pressure. Then, 0.30 g of reduced catalyst was placed in the reactor with 50 mL of n-decane with 4.5 wt percent of anisole, methoxy-cyclohexane, benzene or cyclohexane. The average mass balance was found to be above 92% over three experimental runs. The anisole selectivity and conversion for products were obtained as follows: (1) Conversion (%) = [(Hanisole in feed-Hanisole in product)/ Hanisole in feed] ×100 (2) Selectivity to product i (%) = [Hproduct i / (Hanisole in feed-Hanisole in product)] ×100 where Hanisole in feed and Hanisole in product indicate anisole concentration in the feed and product, respectively, and Hproduct i indicates the concentration of newly created substance i (cyclohexane, methoxy-cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane). 2.4 Characterization A Philips Panalytical X'pert diffractometer was taken to get the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data. N2 nitrogen adsorption analysis was performed at the Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. Parameters of pore structure were obtained by t-plot and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method. NH3-TPD analysis was performed on an apparatus P X 2000 connected with a thermal conductivity detector. H2-TPR and CO pulse chemisorption were carried out on a chemisorption apparatus (Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920). SEM data was carried out on a Hitachi 4800. STEM-EDX analysis was conducted on a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope. 29Si NMR spectra of the zeolites were collected at a Bruker 300 MHz NMR spectrometer. 3 Results and discussion The hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite with nano-crystallite was prepared through the mesoporogen-free SAC process. The synthetic summary is exemplified in Scheme S1. In this process, the sol-gel method was applied to make the aluminosilicate nanogels firstly, with all precursors dissolving in EtOH. Then the EtOH was evaporated from the above nanogels, and the precursor was further gelating and finally became a concentrated nano-gel. Based on the fact that limited mobility of precursor species in SAC process, the nucleation and crystallization in the concentrated nanogel can be modified by temperature and time [49]. The XRD patterns obtained for four HSZ zeolites are displayed in Fig. 1 . All zeolites show characteristic peaks of MFI framework. As in the case of commercial HZSM-5 zeolite, the diffraction intensity is far stronger compared with other samples, indicating better crystallinity. However, the HSZ-a zeolite contains content of the amorphous silica peak (broad hump peak at 2θ = 22°) which probably derivate from amorphous gel. HSZ-b and HSZ-c zeolite present sharp peaks like commercial HZSM-5 demonstrating good crystalline. As reported earlier, the synthesis of hierarchical zeolite in SAC process is a nucleation and growth process controlled by kinetics and crystallization could be inhibited during the nucleation stage, depending on the Al concentration and the crystallization temperature [40]. Compared to the common hydrothermal method, the crucial situation in the mesopores formation in zeolite in this report depended on the state when conversion of amorphous precursor phases into crystalline phase in the localized EtOH ponds. The dissolution rate of amorphous directly related to the crystal nucleation of zeolite in hydrothermal synthesis or in SAC process [50,51]. As a result, under certain gelation conditions, lowering crystallization temperature could decrease the dissolving rate of precursors and could be unfavorable for the transformation of amorphous to crystal. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the isotherm of commercial HZSM-5 exhibits a slightly increase in the region of 0.4∼0.8 P/P0, indicating that there are few mesopores in this sample. With the segmented SAC crystallization, sample HSZ-b and HSZ-c, show hysteresis loops at relative pressure region between 0.4-0.9 indicating the formation of mesopores. HSZ-a shows the highest external surface area (222 m2 g−1) but the lowest crystallinity. It is inferred that the highly mesoporous structures come from the amorphous structure in the concentrated nano-gel. From this point, this initial gel is gradually transformed into nanocrystalline mesoporous ZSM-5 with the decrease of amorphous phase and the increase of the crystalline phase. So, it is true that agglomerative mesopores could be formed in this process as described above. The mesopore sizes for the zeolites obtained from BJH plots are summarized in Table 1 . The BJH mesopore sizes increased with the segmented crystallization (Fig. 2b). The HSZ-c shows the largest mesoporous size. Higher thermal temperature means faster dissolution, more nucleation, and quicker growth [52]. But it would be considered that BJH may be one of the hypothetic models to calculate the pore size distribution. And we can also find hysteresis loop in adsorption-desorption N2 curves for the samples at the relative pressure between 0.4-0.9 indicating that small mesopores may also exist in these samples. In the SAC process, there are some localized EtOH left in gel precursors which was suggested to be localized in pores and is in dynamic balance with the steam. For HSZ-c, the nucleation process is retained at a higher temperature than the crystallization growth process. In this condition, a large amount of nano-crystalline phase could be created at the nucleation process, then the EtOH in the pores is likely to connect with each other formation of large pores. In the following crystallization growth process, the growth of nanocrystalline is hindered and large number of mesopores could be maintained in this process. Compared to HSZ-b, HSZ-c shows larger mesoporous size and larger mesoporous volume; therefore, it is feasible to tune the mesoporous structure in the SAC process. All these results unambiguously confirmed that a sufficient amount of energy at the nucleation stage and low energy at the crystallization stage was necessary for the formation of large size mesoporous zeolite. All samples show single crystalline morphology with a mean size around 500 nm and some voids can be seen on the surface of zeolites. It could be clearly seen in Fig. S1 that HSZ-c shows the smoother surface and fewer voids. In contrast, HSZ-a shows more voids on its surface, and there are some unclear species near the crystal edge composed of amorphous silica-alumina which is likely to be some amorphous gel precursors. When the concentrated nano-gel was placed at 140 °C for 28 h, this steam temperature was insufficient to convert the concentrated nano-gel to fully crystalline ZSM-5 zeolite in limited time which retained many amorphous morphologies in the zeolite. The TEM image confirmed that these are some nano crystals (Fig. S2). More interestingly, the TEM image in Fig. S3 present mesopores in the small nanocrystals and exhibit distinct lattice fringes, suggesting that these nanocrystals have the intra-mesoporous dual-model structure. 29Si MAS NMR (Fig. S4) provide insight into the structural changes during the SAC process. The peak at approximately -105 ppm corresponds to tetrahedral Si(1Al) framework. The peak at -112 and -115 ppm is attributed to tetrahedral Si(0Al) framework. From the deconvoluted spectra, it can be found that the structures of all zeolite seem to be similar. Fig. 3 shows NH3-TPD plots of samples. The peaks centered at 240 °C∼250 °C and 425 °C∼430 °C was ascribed to the desorption of weakly bound NH3 and strongly bound NH3, respectively. The NH3-TPD curve of commercial HZSM-5 exhibited the highest peak area both at lower and high temperature. Through gaussian fitting, as shown in Fig. S3, the quantitative weak and strong acidities are shown in Table 2 . As confirmed by the previous study, aluminum in the framework of zeolite could generate strong acid strength [53]. Compared with HSZ-b, HSZ-c zeolite possess less amount of strong acid sites and lower acid strength, which suggest that the structural acid properties were greatly affected by the segmented crystalline process. HSZ-c with more mesopores area and low crystalline as described in the previous section would be expected to be scarce of framework coordinating aluminum. This finding is also consistent with previous research that mesoporous zeolite usually has less strong acid concentration than microporous zeolite [54]. The evaluation of the accessibility of hierarchical zeolites was performed by 1,3,5-tri-iso-propylbenzene (TIPB) cracking. The diameter of 1,3,5-TIPB with 0.95 nm is large than the micropores of ZSM-5. Fig. 4 shows the conversion for catalytic cracking of the zeolite as a function of the WHSV at 450 °C. Both the zeolites HSZ-c and HSZ-b exhibited higher catalytic conversion than the H-ZSM-5, indicating that catalytic activity was greatly affected by the introduction of mesopores. Since the amorphous mesoporous such as Al-MCM-41 materials also had significant 1,3,5-TIPB conversion than microporous ZSM-5 [41,55], it could be easily expected that conversion of 1,3,5-TIPB was mainly controlled by large surface area. The mesopores depending conversion of 1,3,5-TIPB have also been observed by some previous studies [16,17,56]. However, the product distributions were significantly distinct for the four zeolites (Fig. 5 ). For HSZ-b and HSZ-c, deeper cracking product, benzene is produced, whereas, for HSZ-a, there is much lower amounts of the deeper cracking products, considerable 1,3-DIPB is formed. Thereby, HSZ-b and HSZ-c show high ability for the deeper cracking of 1, 3, 5-TIPB. When the diffusional effect is eliminated by mesopores, the improvement in selectivity would be markedly affected by acidities. Low activity and the low selectivity of sample HSZ-a for deeper cracking product are attributed to the compose of amorphous silica-alumina, where TIPB react on relatively weak acid sites, resulting in a very low selectivity of deeper cracking products. With a hierarchical pore structure, both zeolite HSZ-b and HSZ-c have larger surface areas and mesopore volumes (Table 1). This accessible structure provides a better diffusional space for large molecules to acidity sites inside pores through mesopores, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. Furthermore, the difference in the selectivity between the two zeolites (HSZ-b and HSZ-c) is closely related to their acidities. Due to the relative higher amount of acidities, HSZ-b exhibit higher amounts of benzene than HSZ-c, which likely originate from the crystalline temperature applied during the synthesis. It was reported that the 1,3-DIPB could be easily produced by cracking of 1,3,5-TIPB with the presence of very weak acidities [57,58]. The initial catalytic cracking of TIPB was determined by the external surface of ZSM-5 [59]. In contrast, the higher acidity of HSZ-b compared to the HSZ-c enables to convert the 1,3-DIPB lead to deeper cracking. The acidity seems to be a key parameter for selectivity in 1,3,5-TIPB cracking. These results strongly suggest that the selectivity of ZSM-5 have been subtly changed by the segmented crystallization. The XRD pattern (Fig. S5) showed typical diﬀ ;raction patterns of NiO located at 2θ values of 37° and 63°. Compared to NiO/HZSM-5, the NiO/HSZ did not show obvious peaks at 2θ values of 37° and 63°, indicating that the oxide nickel particles were highly dispersed on HSZ zeolites. After reduction, the XRD peak intensity of Ni planes of (111) located at 44° and (200) located at 52° of Ni/HSZ catalysts are much weaker than that of Ni/HZSM-5, revealing that the metallic nickel becomes smaller size with increasing mesopores of zeolites. Because HSZ has a bigger specific surface area, Ni particles could be highly dispersed after reduction. The existing states of Ni species on HZSM-5 and HSZ zeolites were further investigated by H2-TPR and the results are shown in Fig. 6 . Two NiO reduction peaks were found for these catalysts, indicating two different kinds of NiO species [60]. Peaks located at around 375 °C were induced by the interaction between weakly bonded nickel oxide and the surface of the support. Peaks located at higher temperature (about 453∼575 °C) were caused by strongly bonded nickel oxide besides the surface. Therefore, large amount of nickel with stronger interaction with zeolite was found between NiO and HSZ-b and HSZ-c zeolites. As shown in the TEM images (Fig. S6) of the reduced Ni/HSZ-c catalyst, Ni particles around 5∼20 nm was formed on the zeolite. As presented in Table S1, the nickel size measured by CO pulse chemisorption is around 11 nm for the four catalysts. Ni/HSZ zeolites exhibit slightly smaller nickel particles than Ni/HZSM-5. The BET results confirm the structure of HSZ with agglomerative mesopores. Considering their similar Ni dispersion, the strong interaction between Ni and zeolite may come from the confining effect of Ni particle by these agglomerative mesopores in hierarchical ZSM-5 support. It is found that Ni size above 10 nm is better for the activity of HDO process because small Ni facets are not easily been accessible [19,61]. STEM-EDX was performed to study the morphology of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 7 (a–f), it was found that nickel particles were uniformly dispersed onto the HSZ zeolite. The overall element over the support was also examined by elemental mapping. Fig. 7(c–f) present the composition distribution of Al, Ni, Si and O of HSZ-c zeolite. A series of HZSM-5 loaded nickel catalysts were assessed for anisole hydrodeoxygenation, and the results were presented in Table 3 . The four catalysts show different anisole conversion with cyclohexane and methoxy-cyclohexane as the main products. Significant differences of selectivity were also observed for the two products. Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst shows deficient activity with the anisole conversion of 3%. A possible reason is that the diffusional limit in microporous zeolite reduces the synergistic effect between active metal and acid sites in zeolites. Lots of methoxy-cyclohexane in the products was observed for the sample Ni/HZSM-5, suggesting that it is relatively hard for the dealkylation over active nickel sites of this catalyst. Since The lack of dealkylated compound suggests that dealkylation was restricted which probably need both the active metal sites and the accessible acid sites in micropores of zeolite HZSM-5. Obviously, the diffusional limit reduces the synergy effect between nickel metal and acid sites in zeolites. After HZSM-5 was treated with desilication, which is a common method to introduce mesopores into ZSM-5, higher anisole conversion with higher cyclohexane could be observed. Therefore, it could be further demonstrated that the accessibility of acidities and the synergy between acid sites and nickel metal is crucial for dealkylation. The conversion of anisole is higher over the two Ni/HSZ catalysts. It was noted in Table 2 that these two zeolites show comparable strong acid and Brønsted acid sites amounts which are considered to be essential sites for dealkylation [62,63] and the only distinct differences are mesoporisity. This suggests that the conversion of anisole can be significantly improved by increase accessibility of acidities, which implies that a good crystalline morphology and a mesopores structure are critical to achieve high activities over Ni/zeolites. Ni/HSZ-b gives the highest conversion, which combines sufficient acid sites and the acid site accessibility demonstrated by TIPB cracking. Based on the above results, it is evident that anisole HDO mainly follows the anisole to benzene with metal sites by direct deoxygenation, then cyclohexane formed by hydrogenation. A small part of anisole may convert to methoxy-cyclohexane firstly with aromatic hydrogenation, then slowly to cyclohexane by dealkylation with both metal sites and acid sites. The reaction pathway was further confirmed by the reactions of potential intermediates of Ni/HSZ-c including methoxy-cyclohexane, benzene, and cyclohexane. As shown in Table 4 , the conversion of methoxy-cyclohexane to cyclohexane is a very slow process, which needs nearly 140 min to achieve a conversion of 59.3%. Considering the consumption of cyclohexanol is very fast (Fig. S7), so the rate determined step would be dealkylation. However, the aromatic ring hydrogenation is very fast, and it only takes 10 min for the nearly completed benzene conversion to cyclohexane. The product cyclohexane is relatively stable in the reaction with the time up to 140 min, and only few cyclohexanol forms in the reaction. So, it could be proposed that most of anisole HDO with direct deoxygenation to benzene which fast converts to cyclohexane. The conversion and selectivity of anisole as a function of time over Ni/HSZ-c zeolite was further studied as shown in Fig. 8 . At the beginning time, the conversion of anisole increased significantly with time and then reached to nearly 100% at the time of 140 min. At the same time, the selectivity was found to be higher than 70% at the initial time which indicating a very fast cyclohexane production rate. However, the selectivity of cyclohexane increased slowly with time while the selectivity of methoxy-cyclohexane decreased with time. The cyclohexane is the main products at the initial time, along with continuous decline of methoxy-cyclohexane. Debates exist in literatures for the mechanism pathway for anisole HDO reaction for the zeolite supported catalysts, which probably due to different properties of supports. Gamliel et al. [24] prepared USY zeolite supported Ni, Ru and Pd catalysts, and found that Ni/USY is the most selective catalyst for aromatic compounds. All the catalyst shows high deoxygenated products despite using different metal. The aromatic ring of anisole was completely hydrogenated to form methoxycyclohexane, followed by dealkylation to cyclohexanone. Different mechanism was suggested, Sankaranarayanan et al. [25] proposed that benzene was firstly formed then followed by dealkylation and demethylation. Zhu et al. [62] claimed that direct hydrodeoxygenation reaction was the dominant reaction in anisole conversion for Pt/HBeta zeolite catalyst. Obviously, the reaction pathway in this study is consistent with the last two studies. Acidities paly important role in the deoxygenated step which could be largely improved by accessible acid sites facilitated by mesopores. The reaction pathway for anisole conversion is present in Fig. 9 . The direct deoxygenation process is accomplished by breaking the CO bond directly while retaining the aromatic structure followed by hydrogenation of benzene. The hydrogenation and dealkylation routes involve the saturation of the aromatic ring and breaking the CO bond via dehydration. The reaction mechanism here mainly involves the direct deoxygenation of anisole to benzene and subsequently hydrogenation to cyclohexane at a very short time. Because the direct deoxygenation rate is much faster than the dealkylation rate, lots of methoxy-cyclohexane formed at the initial time. Then the later step involves the further cleavage of the CO bonds of the methoxy-cyclohexane with dealkylation. There are no products such as benzene in this process, suggesting that nickel has excellent aromatic ring hydrogenation ability [64–66]. To finial confirmed the reaction pathway, the reaction was taken at lower temperature and the consumption rate of benzene was expected to become slower. As shown in Table 5 , the intermediate product benzene was found at the temperature as low as 120 °C. With the increase of temperature, benzene disappeared due to very fast hydrogenation rate. 4 Conclusions Hierarchical HSZ zeolites with nanocrystallite are fabricated by a template free solid-state crystallization in EtOH. Highly mesoporous structures came from the amorphous structure in the concentrated nano-gel and mainly agglomerative mesopores generated in this process. The diffusional properties and the selectivity of the HSZ zeolites can be controlled directly demonstrated by the cracking reactions of 1,3,5-TIPB. The diffusional limit in microporous zeolite reduces the synergy effect between active metal and acid sites in zeolites. Thereby, a low anisole conversion was observed. Compared with HSZ-c, HSZ-b zeolite possess more amount of strong acid sites and Brønsted lower acid strength which was found to be more activity for anisole HDO reaction. Besides the excellent diffusion properties, interactions between the Ni and zeolite can be enhanced by mesopores. Mechanism study shows that direct deoxygenation of anisole on the metal sites of the catalyst can start at very short time. Because the direct deoxygenation rate is much faster than the dealkylation rate, lots of methoxy-cyclohexane formed at the initial time. Then the later step involves the further cleavage of the C–O bonds of the methoxy-cyclohexane with dealkylation. The accessibility of acidities and the synergy between acid sites and nickel metal is crucial for dealkylation.

        "dc:description": "Upgrading of bio-oil through catalytic hydrotreating was investigated with anisole as a model compound. Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites with nano-crystalline structure were successfully synthesized by a segmented steam-assisted crystallization method by tuning the rate of crystallization during the phase transforming between the amorphous structure and crystalline structure without using the organic template. The diffusional properties of ZSM-5 samples were investigated by catalytic cracking of 1,3,5-TIPB. Ni/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts displayed an excellent performance in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of biomass-derived anisole to cyclohexane in comparison with conventional Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst. The activity and selectivity were significantly improved by enhancing the accessibility of acidities. Anisole HDO mainly follows the anisole to benzene with metal sites by direct deoxygenation, then cyclohexane formed by hydrogenation.",
