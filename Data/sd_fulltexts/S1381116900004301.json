Tel.: +44-1222-874805; fax: +44-1222-874075 A comparative study of the oxidation of the crotyl alcohol using hydrogen peroxide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidants with TS-1, Ti-β, Ti-Alβ, Ti-MCM-41, Ti-Al-MCM-41 and Ti-grafted-MCM-41 as catalysts is described and discussed. With hydrogen peroxide as oxidant, significant Ti-leaching is observed with all the catalysts except TS-1 (Ti-Alβ>Ti-grafted- MCM-41>Ti-MCM-41>Tiβ>Ti-Al-MCM-41⪢TS-1). For Ti-Alβ, Ti-grafted- MCM-41 and Ti-Al-MCM-41, initial heterogeneously catalysed formation of the epoxide was observed. However, the formation of a Ti-species in solution is shown to contribute to competing homogeneously catalysed formation of ether diols and triol. Using tert-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidant the Ti-leaching was minimised and selective epoxide formation was observed with Ti-β, Ti-Alβ and Ti-MCM-41 as heterogeneous catalysts, although, with Ti-Alβ, the ether diols and triol products dominated due to acid catalysed solvolysis of the epoxide. Keywords Crotyl alcohol oxidation Hydrogen peroxide Tert-butylhydroperoxide TS-1 Ti-β Ti-Alβ Ti-MCM-41 Ti-grafted- MCM-41 Ti-Al-MCM- 41 Ti-leaching 1 Introduction Oxidation of organic substances is a key process in the synthesis of chemical intermediates of use in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industry. Particular interest has been focused on the identification of suitable heterogeneous catalysts that can be used under mild conditions using hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides as oxidants. Most attention has been given to Ti-containing catalysts and this has been prompted by the discovery that the microporous titanium silicalite TS-1 is effective for the oxidation of hydrocarbons [1–4] and alcohols [5,6] and sulfides [7] using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. TS-1 has two notable advantages: firstly, it is hydrophobic [8], and consequently aqueous hydrogen peroxide can be used as oxidant, and secondly, it is very stable under typical reaction conditions and Ti-leaching is minimal for well-prepared samples [9]. However, TS-1 is limited in the range of substrates that can be oxidised, since it has relatively small pores (ca. 0.55nm). In view of this, wide-pore zeolites, e.g. Ti-β [10–12], and microporous materials, e.g. Ti-MCM-41 [13–15], have been investigated and are known to be effective catalysts with hydrogen peroxide and hydroperoxides as oxidants. Oxidation of allylic alcohols is an important route to substituted epoxides and related molecules. With TS-1 it is known that allylic alcohol oxidation proceeds relatively slowly [16] compared with oxidation of unsubstituted alkenes. Oxidation of allylic alcohols, although well studied with homogeneous Ti-catalysts [17], has not been extensively investigated with heterogeneous Ti-catalysts; however, shape selective oxidation of substituted allylic alcohols has been shown to occur with TS-1 [18]. In this paper we present a comparative study of Ti-β and Ti-MCM-41 as catalysts for the oxidation of crotyl alcohol. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials’ synthesis 2.1.1 Synthesis of TS-1 TS-1 (2.4mol% Ti) was prepared according to the method of Taramasso et al. [1]. Tetraethyl orthotitanate (3g, Aldrich) was added dropwise to tetraethyl orthosilicate (91g. Merck) and the mixture was stirred for 2h. To the clear solution, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (100g. Alfa, 40% in water, K<1ppm, Na<3ppm) and deionised water (60g) was added with stirring at 25°C. The clear gel was stirred at 25°C for 1h and then heated at 80°C for 5h to aid hydrolysis; during the procedure, the volume was maintained by addition of deionised water. The resulting solution was heated in a teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 175°C for 10d. The crystalline material was recovered by centrifuging washed with deionised water, dried at 100°C, and calcined in air at 550°C for 24h. The material was confirmed to be well crystallised TS-1 by powder X-ray diffraction. 2.1.2 Synthesis of Ti-Alβ Ti-Alβ (3.2mol% Ti) was synthesised by a method similar to that of Camblor et al. [19]. Aqueous HCl (0.1M, 4.51g) was added dropwise to tetraethyl orthosilicate (12.5g. Merck) and stirred (25°C, 40min). After cooling in ice (15min) the mixture was added dropwise with stirring to a cooled solution of tetraethyl orthotitanate (0.68g. Aldrich) in propan-2-ol (9g), and was stirred for a further period (0°C, 20min; 25°C, 25min). Tetraethylammonium hydroxide (9.8g. 35% in water, Alfa, K<1ppm) was added dropwise with stirring until a white solid formed; this was dried (100°C, 4h). Aluminium isopropoxide (0.03g) and the remainder of the template were added with stirring at 25°C. The resulting solid was placed in a teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 135°C for 192h. Ti-Alβ was recovered as a white crystalline solid by centrifuging and dried (100°C, 16h) and calcined in air (550°C, 24h). The material was confirmed to be Ti-Al-β by powder X-ray diffraction. 2.1.3 Synthesis of Ti-β Aluminium-free Ti-β (1.84mol% Ti) was synthesised in the presence of fluoride ions according to the method of Blasco et al. [20]. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (12.5g. Merck) was added with stirring to a solution of Tetraethylammonium hydroxide (13.84g. Alfa, 35% in water, K<1ppm) and hydrogen peroxide (2.27g. 30vol.%) at 25°C. Tertraethylorthotitanate (2.28g; Aldrich) in ethanol (1ml) was added slowly and the solution stirred to permit the evaporation of ethanol. Hydrofluoric acid (1.37g, 48% in water, BDH) was added and the thick yellow paste so formed was transferred to a teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 140°C for 192h with stirring (60rpm). The crystalline material was recovered by filtration, washed with water, dried (100°C, 24h) and calcined (550°C, 24h). The material was confirmed to be Ti-β by powder X-ray diffraction. 2.1.4 Synthesis of Ti-MCM-41 Ti-MCM-41 (1.2mol% Ti) was prepared using a procedure based on the method outlined by Kayano and Tatsumi [21]. Tetrabutyl orthotitanate (0.27g, Aldich) was added dropwise with stirring to tetraethyl orthosilicate (14.4g. Merck) at 0°C. Cetyltrimethylammonium hydroxide (62ml, 25% in water, prepared by ion exchange of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, BDH) was added dropwise and the mixture was stirred (25°C, 1h) and then heated (80°C, 4h) to remove the ethanol. The solution was heated in an autoclave (120°C, 48h) and the white solid formed was recovered by filtration, washed with deionised water, dried (100°C, 16h) and heated under nitrogen (550°C, 8h). 2.1.5 Synthesis of Ti-grafted MCM-41 Titanocene was grafted onto the surface of siliceous MCM-41 (prepared by the method of Kayano and Tatsumi [21]) according to the procedure of Maschmeyer et al. [22] Titanocene dichloride (0.05g. Strem, in chloroform, 10ml) was added to MCM-41 (0.4g) at 25°C and the mixture was stirred for 30min. Triethylamine (1ml) was added and the colour of the methanol gradually changed from red to yellow over 2h, indicating the substitution of the chloride ligands by siloxide ligands. The material was filtered, washed with chloroform and calcined at 550°C in dry O2 for 24h. 2.1.6 Synthesis of Ti-Al-MCM-41 Ti-Al-MCM-41 was prepared by a method based on that of Prakash et al. [23]. Calcined Al-MCM-41 (17.5g. prepared by the method of Kim et al. [24]) was stirred with titanium tetrachloride (50ml, 1.9M solution in 2.0M HCl, Aldrich) for 30min at 25°C. The material was recovered by filtration, washed with hot water, and dried (70°C, 2h). 2.2 Catalyst testing Catalysts were studied for the epoxidation of crotyl alcohol using the following standard procedure. Crotyl alcohol (0.72g) and hydrogen peroxide (1.35g. aqueous 30vol.%) were stirred together in methanol (50ml) in a round bottom flask in a thermostatted water bath at 30°C. The catalyst was added (0.1g) to initiate the reaction and at subsequent times small aliquots were recovered, filtered hot through a layer of celite, cooled, centrifuged to remove fine catalyst particles and analysed for crotyl alcohol, its epoxide and solvolysis products (no 2-butenal was observed as product) by gas chromatography using dimethyl sulfone as an internal standard. Ti-leaching was determined using ICP-MS analysis. Blank experiments using anatase and silicalite catalysts showed no product formation under standard reaction conditions. In addition, anatase was observed to be insoluble in the reaction mixture and no Ti-leaching was observed from anatase. 3 Results and discussion The oxidation of crotyl alcohol with hydrogen peroxide was investigated with the range of catalysts and the results are shown in Table 1 . TS-1 showed the highest initial activity and the epoxide was observed as the only product for the first few hours; at this stage the pH increased slightly. Subsequently, the epoxide reacted with the methanol solvent and the water present from the use of aqueous hydrogen peroxide to form ether diols and triol, and the pH decreased. No titanium leaching was observed (experimental error±0.5ppm) throughout the experiment. Ti-β initially showed no activity for crotyl alcohol oxidation, although some hydrogen peroxide decomposition was observed, but subsequently a mixture of epoxide, ether diols and triol was observed and the pH decreased. After extensive reaction periods the crotyl alcohol conversion was similar to that observed with TS-1. With Ti-MCM-41, again no activity was observed initially and after an extensive period a mixture of epoxide, ether diols and triol were observed and the pH decreased. In contrast, both Ti-grafted-MCM-41 and Ti-Al-MCM-41 showed initial selectivity for epoxide formation in a similar manner to TS-1. The presence of the Al, together with Ti, seems to promote the formation of epoxide initially (e.g. compare Ti-β with Ti-Alβ, and Ti-MCM-41 with Ti-Al-MCM-41). Under the reaction condition tested, Ti-leaching was observed with all the catalysts except TS-1, and the order of Ti-leaching was found to be: Ti-Alβ>Ti-grafted-MCM-41>Ti-MCM-41>Ti-β>Ti-Al-MCM-41⪢TS-l Experiments were conducted with a range of solvents and oxidants to determine the necessary conditions for Ti-leaching. For the Ti-β and Ti-MCM-41 materials, Ti-leaching was caused by reaction with hydrogen peroxide alone; whereas for TS-1, Ti-leaching could only be induced by reaction with hydrogen peroxide and a triol together. To determine if the solution Ti-species could be active for the oxidation of crotyl alcohol, two sets of experiments were carried out with titanyl acetylacetonate as a model species. The oxidation of crotyl alcohol with hydrogen peroxide was investigated at 50°C for solutions containing 4 and 25ppm Ti, since these concentrations are close to those observed in the catalysis studies. After 80h reaction, 55% crotyl alcohol conversion was observed with the 4ppm Ti solution (yields: epoxide 0%, triol 54% ether, diols 1%), while the 25ppm Ti solution gave 89% crotyl alcohol conversion (yields: epoxide 0%, triol 83%, ether diols 6%). These experiments demonstrate that a solution Ti-species formed by Ti-leaching during the standard reaction could contribute to a homogeneously catalysed reaction. In particular, with Ti-β and Ti-MCM-41 no initial activity is observed for crotyl alcohol oxidation, and conversion is only observed after an extensive reaction time following the onset of Ti-leaching. In these cases, the observed catalysis is probably due wholly to a homogeneously catalysed reaction. However, with Ti-Al-MCM-41, Ti-grafted-MCM-41 and Ti-Alβ there is initial epoxide formation, and for Ti-Al-MCM-41 there is no Ti-leaching in the initial stages of the reaction. However, subsequently, significant Ti-leaching was observed in all cases. Test experiments with tert-butyl hydroperoxide indicated that Ti-leaching would be negligible for all the catalysts if this was used as oxidant. The results of the oxidation of crotyl alcohol with tert-butyl hydroperoxide are shown in Table 2 and it is apparent that Ti-leaching is negligible under these conditions. TS-1, Ti-grafted-MCM-41 and Ti-Al-MCM-41 were all inactive as catalysts. Ti-β and Ti-MCM-41 gave only the epoxide as product and no ring-opened products were observed. The highest activity was observed with Ti-Alβ but, in this case, ring-opened products dominated. It is considered that the Brønsted acid sites in Ti-Alβ, due to the presence of framework Al, catalyse the solvolysis of the epoxide, leading to the formation of triol and ether diols. These studies show that, by identification of suitable combinations of Ti-catalyst and oxidant, systems can be identified that can give high selectivities for epoxide formation under conditions where no Ti-leaching is observed. However, this study also shows that in many cases, particularly when using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant, Ti-leaching can be significant and can contribute to a homogeneously catalysed route that will compete with, and possible mask, the desired heterogeneously catalysed process.

        "dc:description": "A comparative study of the oxidation of the crotyl alcohol using hydrogen peroxide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidants with TS-1, Ti-β, Ti-Alβ, Ti-MCM-41, Ti-Al-MCM-41 and Ti-grafted-MCM-41 as catalysts is described and discussed. With hydrogen peroxide as oxidant, significant Ti-leaching is observed with all the catalysts except TS-1 (Ti-Alβ>Ti-grafted- MCM-41>Ti-MCM-41>Tiβ>Ti-Al-MCM-41⪢TS-1). For Ti-Alβ, Ti-grafted- MCM-41 and Ti-Al-MCM-41, initial heterogeneously catalysed formation of the epoxide was observed. However, the formation of a Ti-species in solution is shown to contribute to competing homogeneously catalysed formation of ether diols and triol. Using tert-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidant the Ti-leaching was minimised and selective epoxide formation was observed with Ti-β, Ti-Alβ and Ti-MCM-41 as heterogeneous catalysts, although, with Ti-Alβ, the ether diols and triol products dominated due to acid catalysed solvolysis of the epoxide.",
