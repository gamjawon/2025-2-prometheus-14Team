Photocatalysis transfers CO2 molecules into hydrocarbons and aligns with the principles of photosynthesis. In addition to the efficiency, reaction selectivity is another important concern in photocatalysis and is generally dependent on the kind of co-catalysts that provide an active site. In the present study, the role of the co-catalyst is focused on, and the Cu and Co species, as well as the bimetallic CuCo species, are applied for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Based on the in-situ investigation, the role of the co-catalyst of the Cu/TS1 is dominated by the HCOO* intermediate during the CO2 reduction reaction, resulting in the formation of HCOOH as the main product. The role of the bimetallic 1Cu2Co/TS1 is alternatively dominated by *COOH intermediate, resulting in the formation of CO as the main product. The density functional theory (DFT) is applied to simulate the pathway of the CO2 reduction reaction. From these results, the present study has shown the importance of the physicochemical properties of co-catalysts in determining the selectivity for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions.

Currently, the focus of the CO2 conversion lies primarily on C1 products such as HCOOH [2], CO [3,4], HCHO [5], and CH3OH [6], as these transformations are thermodynamically feasible for most photocatalysts. Taking CO2 to CO conversion as an illustrative example at 25 °C, the Gibbs free energy is 257 kJ/mol, corresponding to a reversible voltage of 1.33 V. However, the practical application of this conversion is often hindered by slow reaction kinetics, resulting in poor yield and selectivity. These limitations are closely tied to the physicochemical properties of active sites on the catalyst. Before the reaction, active sites are likely to induce a net dipole moment in the linear CO2 molecule, reducing its chemical inertness [7,8]. Moreover, these sites play a crucial role in generating and stabilizing chemical reaction intermediates, ultimately determining the yield and selectivity for the resulting products [9,10]. In thermocatalysis, the mechanism of the CO2 reduction reaction has generally been understood through the detection of key intermediates of either *COOH or HCOO* [11]. The active site of the catalyst plays a role in determining the pathway with a lower energy barrier [12]. For instance, Cu29 nanoparticles were found to exhibit superior catalytic activity towards CO2 hydrogenation to methanol owing to their flexibility and the presence of low-coordinated active Cu sites [13]. Such low-coordinated active metal sites were found to stabilize HCOO* by lowering the barrier of their hydrogenation. Those pathways have been extensively explored in both electrocatalysis and thermocatalysis by applying advanced in-situ spectroscopic techniques. However, their intricacies are seldom investigated in a photocatalysis system. In a typical photocatalytic system, a photocatalyst is normally accompanied by a suitable co-catalyst for certain redox reactions. Generally, the kinetics of a redox reaction of photocatalysis is responsible for the bandgap of the photocatalyst and is generally regulated by a co-catalyst that provides active sites [14,15]. In the present study, the role of the co-catalyst of a photocatalytic system in the CO2 reduction reaction has been focused on, attempting to uncover the relationship between the active site on the co-catalyst and the pathways of the redox reaction. Specifically, the Co, Cu, and their bimetallic oxides were applied as co-catalysts, and their influences on the production of CO and HCOOH in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) were investigated. The metal oxides were designed to uniformly load into titanium silicalite-1 (TS1) to minimize the other influences, and they were applied as co-catalysts. Meanwhile, a photocatalyst and a hole scavenger were homogeneously applied in the system to avoid the interference from the other factors. As a result, CO and HCOOH were collected as the main products from the CO2RR. Importantly, the key intermediates, namely *COOH and HCOO*, were detected. In the present photocatalytic system, when Cu/TS1 was applied as a co-catalyst, the pathway was dominated by HCOO* intermediate, which resulted in the formation of HCOOH as the main product. On the other hand, when the bimetallic 1Cu2Co/TS1 was applied as a co-catalyst, the pathway was alternatively dominated by *COOH intermediate, which led to the formation of CO as the main product. When the Co/TS1 was applied, both signals of *COOH and HCOO* were reduced, leading to low concentrations of both CO and HCOOH products. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) was applied to understand the pathway, agreeing with the results obtained by in-situ spectroscopic characterizations. Thus, the present work has paved the way for understanding the role of active sites in photocatalytic CO2RR. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalysts preparation 2.1.1 Preparation of TS-1 The TS-1 was synthesized via a hydrothermal technique. In detail, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, Sinopharm Chemical, AR) and tetrabutyl orthotitanate (TBOT, Aladdin, 99.0 %) were transferred to a beaker and stirred 15 min until a homogeneous mixture was formed. Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, Energy Chemical, 25 wt % in water) was mixed with water and slowly added drop into the homogeneous solution, stirred for 30 min until a clear solution was formed. Transferred the solution to a water bath at 50 °C and stirred it for 1 h, then stirred at 80 °C for 1 h. Made up the evaporated weight of the solution with water, and transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, and kept at 170 °C for 48 h. To remove the organic residue, the white produce was washed until the pH was 7 and dried at 80 °C overnight. Finally, the produce was calcined at 550 °C for 6 h in air to obtain the TS-1 sample. 2.1.2 Preparation of 2Co/TS1, 1Cu2Co/TS1, and 2Cu/TS1 2Co/TS-1 was synthesized via an equal volume impregnation method. 0.500 mg Co (NO3)2·6H2O (Aladdin, 99.99 %) was added to an appropriate amount of deionized water, which was dropped into 9.5 g of TS-1 and aged for 2 h. The obtained sample was dried at 80 °C for 12 h and calcined at 600 °C for 2 h with a rate of 5 °C/min in air. Finally, the sample was heated to 600 °C at 2 °C/min and maintained at the temperature for 4 h in H2/Ar flow (5 vol. % H2 in Ar) to obtain 2Co/TS1. 1Cu2Co/TS1, and 2Cu/TS1 were prepared through a similar approach. 2.2 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Smart Lab SE, Rigaku, Japan) patterns of the samples were obtained with Cu-Ka radioactive source. The functional groups of the samples were measured by iQS50 FT-IR spectrometer (IR, Thermo Fisher Scientific, US) in the range of 4000–400 cm-1. The N2 adsorption-desorption experiment was performed on a surface area and porosity analyzer ASAP 2020 PLUS HD88 (Micrometrics, US), and the samples were preheated for 6 h at 300 °C before measurement. The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller equations were used to measure the pore size distribution and the specific surface area (BET) of samples, respectively. The CO2 absorption capacity of the samples was measured by BELSORP-mini (Microtrac BEL, Japan) under 0–1 bar at 278 K. The morphology and structure of the samples were studied using a FEI TalosF200x transmission electron microscope (TEM, Thermo Scientific FEI, US) and TESCAN MIRA LMS scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi, China). The actual Cu and Co content in the catalysts were measured by iCAP 7000 Plus ICP-OES (ICP, Thermo, US). The element valence states of the samples were analyzed using ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo, US). The banding energy was corrected by the environmental carbon C 1 s at 284.8 eV. The CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) of samples was measured by BELCAT-B (Microtrac BEL, Japan) under 50–700 °C. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was carried out using AutoChem II 2920 (Micromeritics, US) under 50–800 °C. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (In situ FTIR) was carried out on iQS50 FT-IR spectrometer with an in-situ reaction cell. Ru(bpy)3Cl2 (TCI, 98.0 %) and 1Cu2Co/TS1 were placed in an in-situ cell and purged with Ar for 30 min to remove H2O and impurities from the surface. Then, the gas (5 % CO2 in Ar) carried with TEOA (Sinopharm Chemical, AR)/CH3CN (Aladdin, 99.0 %)/H2O solution was selected as the gas source to simulate the photocatalytic reaction condition. After 30 min, the samples were irradiated in situ cell with an Xe lamp, and the infrared absorbance spectra were recorded every minute. The Drift CO and in situ FTIR CO2 of samples were also carried out on IQS50 FT-IR spectrometer. The measurement of electrochemical impedance and transient photocurrent was performed on a Bio-Logic VSP300 electrochemical workstation (Bio-Logic, France), and used FTO-coated glass, Ag/AgCl electrode, and Pt foil as working electrode, reference electrode, and counter electrode, respectively. The measurement of transient photocurrent was processed in Ru(bpy)3Cl2 (TCI, 98.0 %), TEOA (Sinopharm Chemical, AR), and CH3CN (Aladdin, 99.0 %) solution with radiation from a 300 W Xe lamp. The electrochemical impedance spectra were obtained by conducting the test in 0.2 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. 2.3 Catalyst evaluation The photocatalytic CO2 reductions were performed in a gas-closed quartz reactor with the volume of 88 mL. [Ru(bpy)3] Cl2·6H2O (10 mg) and catalyst (1 mg) were blended into a solution containing CH3CN: H2O = 3:1 (4 mL), and TEOA (1 mL) as the sacrificial agent. The system was evacuated by a mechanical pump and filled with 1 atm gases (98 % CO2, 5 % He) three times. The solution was irradiated with a 420 nm LED lamp (100 W) for an hour under vigorous stirring at room temperature. The gas products of the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction were analyzed using a gas chromatography with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and 5A molecular sieve packed column using Argon as the carrier gas. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure characterization of co-catalysts The species of 2 wt % of Co, 2 wt % of Cu, and 1 wt % Cu&2 wt % Co were loaded onto the TS1, named as 2Co/TS, 2Cu/TS, and 1Cu2Co/TS1, respectively. As shown in Figure S1, scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images exhibit the cuboid structure of the TS1. As shown in Figure S2, the metal species is observed in transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images. In the 2Co/TS1, the lattice fringes with distances of 2.50 Å (Fig. 1 a) and 2.01 Å (Fig. 1b) are observed and assigned to the Co3O4 (311) and Co (111) planes, respectively. In the 2Cu/TS1, lattice planes with distances of 2.09 Å (Fig. 1d) and 2.43 Å (Fig. 1e) are owing to the Cu (111) and Cu2O (111) planes, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1i, all the Cu and Co species are observed on the 1Cu2Co/TS1, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD, Figure S4) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer (Figure S5) were used to probe the co-catalyst. However, all the observed spectra were attributed to the TS1, but it was difficult to detect the metal species, likely owing to the low concentration of the metal species. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to study the metal species. As shown in Fig. 2 a, in the Co 2p spectrum, two main peaks are observable, being assigned to the Co 2p spectrum at 782.08 eV and 797.88 eV, which are due to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively [16,17]. While, the peaks at 783.90 eV, 781.93 eV, and 779.65 eV were found to belong to the Co2+, Co3+, and Co0, respectively [18–20]. In the Cu 2p spectrum (Figure S6), two main peaks at 933.28 eV and 952.98 eV are assigned to the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively. The peak at 933.28 eV corresponds to Cu+/Cu0, while the peak at 935.00 eV is attributed to Cu2+ [13]. In the Cu LMM spectrum, peaks at 917.31 eV, 915.21 eV, and 913.15 eV were observed, assigning to Cu0, Cu2+, and Cu+, respectively [21,22]. The Co and Cu spectra of the 1Cu2Co/TS1 were also investigated. It is obvious that the Co species in bimetallic catalysts were found to exist in higher valence states compared to monometallic catalysts. However, the Cu species in the catalyst showed the opposite trend, indicating an interaction between Cu and Co species in bimetallic catalysts, where their valence states underwent opposite changes. The quantity of the Co and Cu species in the co-catalysts was studied by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and the results are shown in Table S1. The nitrogen adsorption was used to study the BET surface areas of the catalysts (Figure S7 and Table S2). By loading the metal species, all the samples exhibited a negligible decrease in the surface area, implying that the low loading amount with highly homogeneous dispersion of the metal species allows the channels of the TS1 to be accessible, maximizing the exposed active sites for redox reactions. 3.2 Catalytic performance of co-catalysts The photocatalytic CO2RR was realized by a typical photocatalytic system with [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2, tri-ethanolamine (TEOA), and acetonitrile as a homogeneous photocatalytic system, sacrificial agent, and solvent, respectively. Controlled experiments were performed before the study of the co-catalyst (Figs. 3 a & Table S3). If the reaction was performed without irradiation of light, no products are detected except for trace amounts of H2, revealing that the reaction is driven by utilizing photo energy. In addition, if the CO2 was replaced with Ar, no C1 products were produced, revealing that CO2 is the source of C1 products. In addition, the CO2 adsorption capacity of co-catalysts was investigated (Figure S9), and it can be seen that the adsorption capability of 1Cu2Co/TS1 is slightly better than other catalysts. The results of CO2RR are shown in Fig. 3b and Table S4, respectively. In the present photocatalytic system, when the 2Cu/TS1 was applied as a monometallic co-catalyst, HCOOH was obtained as the main product with a rate of 102.5 μmol/h, and the CO was collected with a rate of only 0.6 μmol/h. When the bimetallic 1Cu2Co/TS1 was applied, the rate for CO production was ca. 46.7 μmol/h, and the rate of HCOOH production was ca. 30.6 μmol/h. Moreover, as a comparison, the CuCo2O4 was applied to evaluate CO2RR, the main product was CO, but the production rate was 22.0 μmol/h, and only a trace of HCOOH was obtained. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of Cu loading on catalytic performance, and the results are shown in Figure S8 & Table S4. The selectivity of CO is slightly reduced with the Cu introduction, but with the increase of Cu loading, the production and selectivity of CO both show a volcanic trend. On the contrary, the production of HCOOH maintained an increasing trend. 3.3 Reaction mechanism To have a deep understanding of the selectivity of the CO2RR, in-situ FTIR spectroscopy was applied, and the observed spectra are shown in Fig. 4 . The peaks at 1558 cm-1 and 1540 cm-1 are assigned to the bidentate carbonates (b-CO3 2-) [23,24]. Two peaks at 1525 cm-1 and 1456 cm-1 are related to the monodentate carbonate (m-CO3 2-). The peaks at 1417 cm-1, 1476 cm-1, and 1608 cm-1 correspond to bicarbonate (HCO3 -), which are attributed to the adsorption of CO2 on the hydroxyl group on the surface of the catalyst [25,26]. It is worth noting that the infrared peak of *CO2 - is detected at 1660 cm-1, being the activation process of CO2 by receiving electrons (*CO2 + e - → *CO2 -) [27–29]. The carboxylate (*COOH) and formate (HCOO*) have been known as the key intermediates to determine the selectivity of CO2RR, resulting in the formation of CO and HCOOH, respectively [30,31]. As shown in Fig. 4, it is obvious that *COOH is observed at ca. 1575 cm-1, and the peak at 1508 cm-1 is accompanied [32]. The peaks located at 1590 cm-1 correspond to HCOO* [33]. HCOO* is detected as the main intermediate on the 2Cu/TS1, and the bimetallic 1Cu2Co/TS1 exhibits that *COOH is produced as the main intermediate. In comparison, when the 2Co/TS1 was applied, both signals due to *COOH and HCOO* were reduced. These observations were found to agree with the results obtained in CO2RR (Fig. 3). To further investigate the performance of such a unique CuCo bimetallic structure in CO2RR, the DFT calculations were also considered in the present study (models in Figure S13). Based on the experimental results and previously reported work [34], it is clear that the competition between carboxylate (*COOH) and formate (HCOO*), as well as the desorption of CO are the decisive factors in determining the reaction rate. The theoretical calculations show that on monometallic co-catalysts (2Cu/TS1 and 2Co/TS1, Figures S14a and b), the adsorption of *COOH species is weaker than that of HCOO* species (−2.69 vs. −2.79 eV and −1.43 vs. −1.78 eV, respectively). However, the adsorption of *COOH species on the bimetallic 1Cu2Co/TS1 co-catalyst (Figure S14c) is stronger than that of HCOO* species (−1.63 vs. −1.27 eV). The higher thermodynamic stability of *COOH on the 1Cu2Co/TS1 is in good accordance with experiments obtained by FTIR and indicates the CuCo structural properties. Moreover, the adsorption energy of the produced CO* on the 1Cu2Co/TS1 is found to be more positive (−0.44 eV) than the other two surfaces (−1.94 and −0.53 eV, respectively), which indicates that CO is thermodynamically favorable for desorption on the bimetallic co-catalyst surface. As shown in Figure S14, these results are attributed to the different coordination environments caused by the incoming Cu into the Co surface. The changes in Gibbs free energy were analyzed by DFT calculations to further understand the role of the CuCo bimetallic co-catalysts in the enhanced performance. As shown in Figure S14, theoretical calculations suggest that there are two pathways for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO, COOH, and HCOO, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5 a & b, the changes in formation free energy (G) of *COOH on the 2Cu/TS1 and 2Co/TS1 are −0.51 and 0.75 eV, respectively, which are significantly higher than that of HCOO* (−0.95 and 0.06 eV, respectively), indicating that HCOO species are more readily produced on the surface of monometallic catalysts. Whereas the conversion of HCOO to HCO* was required to overcome extremely high energy barriers (2.44 and 2.80 eV) and also more free energy (1.94 and 0.53 eV) for *CO desorption from monometallic catalysts, thus the HCOO pathway is difficult to produce CO. Basically, both pathways on monometallic catalysts are thermodynamically unfavorable for the CO production. While, as shown in Fig. 5c, on the 1Cu2Co/TS1, the bimetallic CuCo active sites function to reduce the required free energy change in *COOH formation (0.54 eV) and meanwhile increasing changes in the required free energy of HCOO* formation (0.57 eV), these resulting in a more favorable formation of *COOH intermediates. In addition, the calculated ΔG for the formation of CO from COOH is found to be exothermic (−0.17 eV) and significantly lower than that for the dissociation of HCOO (1.17 eV). Therefore, COOH served as the dominant intermediate on the CuCo bimetallic catalysts for CO formation. Furthermore, the CO desorption from the bimetallic active sites is also relatively likely compared to that from the monometallic catalysts (0.44 eV vs. 1.94 and 0.53 eV), which benefited CO yielding during these processes. In addition, the free energy of the HCOOH generation process was also analyzed by DFT calculations. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that on 2Cu/TS1 and 2Co/TS1, the rate-determining step (RDS) for the formation of HCOOH is the desorption of HCOOH. However, on the 1Cu2Co/TS1, as the free energy required for HCOO formation increases, the RDS of the HCOOH production process shifts to the formation of HCOO. Therefore, on the 1Cu2Co/TS1, the formation rate of CO is faster than that of HCOOH, which is consistent with our experimental CO₂RR results. As a result, the CuCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit superior catalytic activity for CO production compared to the Cu and Co monometallic catalysts. Thus, the present calculations provided a supplementary explanation from a theoretical point of view. The role of bimetallic co-catalysts was further revealed by comparing the monometallic and bimetallic active sites. Compared with the monometallic HCOO pathway, the bimetallic COOH pathway produces CO, and the theoretical calculations show that the COOH pathway is more convenient to produce CO. The present study indicates that the bimetallic active sites increase the energy barrier for the formation of HCOO*, which enhances the competitiveness of the formation of *COOH intermediate and facilitates the formation of COOH, resulting in providing a thermodynamically more feasible reaction pathway for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. 4 Conclusions In summary, the present study reported that a homogeneously dispersed bimetallic catalyst loaded onto the TS-1 (1Cu2Co/TS1) enhanced the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to produce CO. Compared with the monometallic catalysts, the 1Cu2Co/TS1 was found to have a higher activation capacity for the CO2 adsorption and exhibit an excellent charge carrier separation and transfer during the photocatalytic CO2 conversion. From the results obtained by in situ FTIR spectra and DFT calculations, the strong interaction between the bimetals was found to be essential to improve the catalytic performance, changing the photocatalytic CO2 reduction pathway, and improving the selectivity for the formation of an important intermediate of *COOH, resulting in the efficient production of CO. The present work revealed the synergistic effect of the bimetallic active sites in photocatalytic CO2 reduction and also provided a feasible strategy to understand the role of metal active sites in photocatalytic reactions.

        "dc:description": "Photocatalysis transfers CO2 molecules into hydrocarbons and aligns with the principles of photosynthesis. In addition to the efficiency, reaction selectivity is another important concern in photocatalysis and is generally dependent on the kind of co-catalysts that provide an active site. In the present study, the role of the co-catalyst is focused on, and the Cu and Co species, as well as the bimetallic CuCo species, are applied for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Based on the in-situ investigation, the role of the co-catalyst of the Cu/TS1 is dominated by the HCOO* intermediate during the CO2 reduction reaction, resulting in the formation of HCOOH as the main product. The role of the bimetallic 1Cu2Co/TS1 is alternatively dominated by *COOH intermediate, resulting in the formation of CO as the main product. The density functional theory (DFT) is applied to simulate the pathway of the CO2 reduction reaction. From these results, the present study has shown the importance of the physicochemical properties of co-catalysts in determining the selectivity for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions.",
