The catalyst reduced at 703 K showed good activity at 3.0 MPa, 495 K, H 2 /CO (V/V) = 2, and GHSV = 500 h 1 . CO conversion and selec- tivity for total alcohols were 59.1% and 42.0%, respectively, and C 6 –C 18 higher alcohols were 50.4% of the alcohols. Metallic cobalt and cobalt carbide were detected by XRD as the main cobalt species. The reduction temperature affects both the cobalt dispersion and formation of cobalt carbide. Cobalt carbide may play an important role in the synthesis of higher alcohols on Co-La-Zr/AC. Key words: cobalt catalyst; FT synthesis; reduction temperature; high alcohol; cobalt carbide � The utilization of natural gas has attracted increasing atten- tion due to the potential shortage of petroleum reserves, and the direct synthesis of mixed alcohols from syngas (H 2 and CO) is a field of interest. Catalysts for producing mixed alcohols from syngas include modified methanol synthesis catalysts, al- kali-doped molybdenum sulfide catalysts, and modified Fischer-Trosch (FT) synthesis catalysts [1–5]. C 1 –C 6 alcohols can be successfully produced from syngas over the above catalysts. Few reports have considered the direct synthesis of C 6 –C 18 alcohols with improved yields from syngas. These are the feed stocks for plasticizers, detergents, and lubricants. The modified FT synthesis catalysts are thought to be attractive for industrial applications due to their high activity, high selectiv- ity toward higher alcohols, and moderate reaction conditions. Here, we report on the influence of reduction temperature on the performance of a Co-La-Zr/AC catalyst in CO hydrogena- tion. The Co-La-Zr/AC catalyst was prepared by co-impregnation. Activated carbon made from coconut shell (20–40 mesh, BET surface area 893 m 2 /g, and pore volume 0.57 cm 3 /g) was dried for 0.5 h and impregnated in a rotary evaporator at RT with an aqueous solution of lanthanum nitrate, zirconium nitrate, and cobalt nitrate mixture. After evaporation of the water and drying in air at 363 K for 8.0 h, the sample was calcined at 623 K for 3.0 h under argon. The loadings of Co, Zr, and La were 15%, 1.0%, and 0.5%, respectively. Activity evaluation was carried out in a stainless steel fixed-bed microreactor. The samples (4 ml) were reduced in situ in a flow of H 2 for 12 h before reaction. Data were taken 48 h after the reaction started and a steady state activity had ap- peared. The product gases were analyzed online by an Agilent 3000A Micro GC and TCD detector. The liquid organic prod- ucts and aqueous products were analyzed offline with a HP 6890 GC and FID detector. XRD analysis was carried out using a PANalytical X´Pert PRO diffractometer. Temperature-pro- grammed reduction (TPR) experiments were performed on a Micromeritics Autochem 2910 apparatus, and an Omnistar 300 quadrupole mass spectrometer was used for detection. CO hydrogenation results over the Co-La-Zr/AC catalysts are presented in Table 1. The products contained C 1 –C 18 al- cohols, C 1 –C 21 hydrocarbons, and CO 2 . Almost all the alcohols were linear . -alcohols, which obeyed the Schulz-Flory distri- bution. When the reduction temperature was increased from 623 to 703 K, the CO conversion increased from 25.9% to 59.1%, and the selectivity for alcohols increased from 33.2% to 42.0%. The concentration of C 6 –C 18 higher alcohols reached JIAO Guiping et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(2): 92–94 50.4% in the total alcohols. CO conversion and alcohol selec- tivity decreased with the further increase of reduction tem- perature. We can conclude that the reduction temperature played a pivotal role in the CO hydrogenation performance of the Co-La-Zr/AC catalysts. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the Co-La-Zr/AC catalysts reduced at different temperatures. Diffraction peaks that can be attributed to metallic cobalt (Co 0 ) and CoO appeared on the samples before the FT reaction. Using the Scherrer equation, the cobalt particle sizes on the samples reduced at 623, 653, 673, 703, and 723 K were calculated as 32.1, 20.9, 14.9, 12.6, and 14.0 nm, respectively. We conclude that the reason for the activity increase when the reduction temperature increased from 623 to 703 K was the higher cobalt dispersion. The major products are hydrocarbons with only a small amount of oxygenates with traditional Co-based catalysts. It is well known that Co 0 is responsible for the formation of hy- drocarbons. Interestingly, the alcohol selectivity was surpris- ingly high at 42.0% in the case of reduction at 703 K. This implied that there may be active species other than metallic cobalt particles on the surface of the Co-La-Zr/AC catalyst. The XRD results showed the existence of cobalt carbide (Co 2 C) species besides Co 0 on the used Co-La-Zr/AC catalysts (Fig. 1(b)). The transition metal carbides usually exhibit noble metal-like characteristics and are able to adsorb CO without dissociation, and Co 2 C species was reported to have an im- portant role in the formation of alcohols [6]. Accordingly, we believe that the Co 2 C species are the active sites for the inser- tion of adsorbed CO while Co 0 particles are the active sites for the dissociation of adsorbed CO and growth of carbon chains on the Co-La-Zr/AC catalysts. The typical diffraction peaks due to Co 2 C species were much sharper for samples reduced at lower temperature while they became broader with increased reduction temperature. This suggests that the reduction tem- perature affects the formation of Co 2 C species and, in turn, both the activity and alcohol selectivity. Because the reduction temperature has a strong effect on FT synthesis over the Co-La-Zr/AC catalyst, catalyst reducibility was further investigated by H 2 -TPR experiments. Fig. 2 gives the H 2 -TPR profiles over the Co-La-Zr/AC catalyst. The first two hydrogen consumption peaks at 480 and 595 K were due to the two-step reduction of Co 3 O 4 to CoO and then to Co 0 [7,8], while the broad peak at higher temperature was due to the hydrogenation of oxygen-containing groups on the surface of activated carbon. Strong signals for CH 4 , CO, and CO 2 were detected above 600 K, which implied the existence of abundant oxygen-containing organic groups on the surface of activated carbon. We can postulate that these oxygen-containing organic groups affect the dispersion of cobalt particles. It was reported that the Pt particle size on a Pt/C catalyst decreased with an increase in reduction temperature [9], and it was suggested that the faster decomposition of oxygen-containing organic groups Table 1 Effect of reduction temperature on CO hydrogenation activity over the Co-La-Zr/AC catalyst Selectivity (%) Alcohol distribution (%) Reduction temperature (K) CO conversion (%) HC 1–4 CO 2 HC 5+ ROH C 1 C 2–5 C 6–18 .

JIAO Guiping et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(2): 92–94 at higher reduction temperatures inhibited Pt particle agglom- eration. On the other hand, we also postulate that the higher reduction temperature leads to a higher degree of cobalt re- duction. When the Co-La-Zr/AC catalyst was reduced at 703 K, appropriate amounts of Co 0 and Co 2 C species were obtained. Further careful and extensive research needs to be carried out to understand the effect of Co 2 C on CO hydrogenation over Co-based catalysts. In summary, direct synthesis of higher mixed alcohols from syngas under moderate reaction conditions was achieved over a Co-La-Zr/AC catalyst reduced at 703 K. The reduction tem- perature affected the metal cobalt dispersion, the degree of cobalt reduction, and the amount of Co 2 C species formed. References [1] Subramani V, Gangwal S K.
