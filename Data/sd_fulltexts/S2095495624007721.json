Graphical abstract The electron distribution in Fe single atomic (FeSA) sites was modified by Fe atomic clusters (FeAC), which promotes and optimizes the intermediate configuration, thereby boosting the ORR catalytic activity. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) could be effectively regulated by adjusting electron configurations and optimizing chemical bonds. Herein, we have achieved the modulation of electron distribution in Fe single atomic (FeSA) sites through Fe atomic clusters (FeAC) via a confined pyrolysis approach, thereby enhancing their intrinsic ORR activity. X-ray absorption spectroscopy has confirmed that the presence of iron atomic clusters could influence the electron distribution at Fe-N4 sites. The FeSA/FeAC-NC catalyst exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.88 V, surpassing the individual FeSA-NC structure. Through electronic structure analysis, it could be seen that iron atom clusters can affect Fe-N4 sites through long-range effects, and then effectively lower reaction barriers and enhance the reaction kinetics at Fe-N4 sites. The synthetic approach might pave the way for constructing highly active catalysts with tunable atomic structures, representing an effective and universal technique for electron modulation in M-N-C systems. This work provides enlightenment for the exploration of more efficient single-atom electrocatalysts and the optimization of the performance of atomic electrocatalysts. Furthermore, a zinc-air battery assembled using it on their cathode deliver a high peak power density (205.7 mW cm−2) and a high-specific capacity of 807.5 mA h g−1. This study offers a fresh approach to effectively enhance the synergistic interaction of between Fe single atom and Fe atomic clusters for improving ORR activity and energy storage. Keywords Single atomic catalysts Atom-cluster induce effect Oxygen reduction reaction Fe-N4 sites 1 Introduction The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a significant role in various renewable energy conversion and storage systems, such as metal-air batteries and fuel cells [1–5]. Developing efficient electrocatalysts for ORR is a key challenge in the advancement of metal-air batteries and fuel cells, as it involves complex multi-electron and proton transfer processes and exhibits sluggish kinetics [6–11]. However, platinum-based materials, which are commonly used as ORR catalysts, suffer from inherent drawbacks of high cost and limited availability, severely hampering their sustainability in commercial applications [12–14]. Therefore, the design and fabrication of highly efficient and durable non-precious metal-based ORR electrocatalysts are of paramount importance, but they also present significant challenges. Due to their high surface-atomic ratio and unique electronic structures, various of single-atom catalysts and cluster catalysts have been widely applied in energy conversion reactions as alternatives to noble metal-based electrocatalysts [15–19]. Researchers can improve the activity of electrocatalysts through two effective approaches: increasing the number of active sites and enhancing the intrinsic activity of each active site [20–24]. However, the high activity of active sites in single-atom catalysts is thermodynamically unstable, limiting the increase in active sites [25–29]. On the other hand, although atomic clusters have relatively high thermal stability compared to single-atom catalysts, they cannot achieve sufficient exposure to active sites, leading to limited atomic utilization and catalytic activity [30–34]. Therefore, the characteristics of single-atom and atom-cluster catalysts complement each other in terms of their advantages and limitations. Recently, integrating single atoms with clusters and nanoparticles into a unified catalyst is an effective way to address these drawbacks via a synergistic electrocatalytic ORR [35,36]. Establishing robust connection between single-atomic active centers and neighboring synergistic components has the potential to enhance the catalytic activity, longevity and boost reaction dynamics [37]. Furthermore, the interaction between multi-nuclear atomic clusters and single-atom active sites in catalytic reactions is still in the early stage of research, and a better understanding of their influence on the adsorption/desorption processes of oxygen-containing intermediates in the ORR is needed [38–41]. Therefore, it is crucial but challenging to investigate the long-range interactions between single atoms and atomic clusters to understand the reaction mechanisms involving oxygen intermediates. Herein, we present a general strategy for synthesizing a highly efficient catalyst for the ORR called Fe single-atom and atomic cluster coexisting catalyst (FeSA/FeAC-NC). This catalyst is constructed by utilizing N-doped porous carbon (NC) derived from ZIF-8 as the support material. By carefully controlling the heating rate during synthesis, we were able to achieve the controlled generation of Fe single atoms and atomic clusters within the catalyst. Experimental results demonstrated that FeSA/FeAC-NC exhibited remarkable performance in ORR, with a high half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.88 V in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, this catalyst displayed excellent stability and methanol tolerance. Notably, these performances surpassed those of Fe single-atom catalysts (FeSA-NC) that require high-concentration acid etching for their preparation. The enhanced catalytic activity of FeSA/FeAC-NC can be attributed to the remote electronic exchange effect of Fe single-atom-atomic cluster, which promotes and optimizes the intermediate configuration, thereby boosting the ORR catalytic activity. This study offers new insights into the design and understanding of synergistic catalysis between single atoms and atomic clusters. Moreover, utilizing the FeSA/FeAC-NC as a cathode electrocatalyst in an as-assembled Zn-air battery showed a maximum power density of 205.7 mW cm−2 and outstanding durability over a period of 100 h. 2 Results and discussion The synthesis strategy of FeSA/FeAC-NC, as depicted in Fig. 1 a, involves a simple hydrothermal method to successfully prepare ZIF-8 with a microporous structure. Subsequently, a high-temperature thermal treatment is employed to volatilize the Zn ions, resulting in the derivation of nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) as a template support. The rich mesoporous characteristics of NC are fully utilized to facilitate the absorption of Fe(II)-phenanthroline complexes through capillary confinement. Finally, a precisely controlled temperature is employed for secondary thermal treatment, leading to the formation of Fe clusters and the coexistence of Fe single-atom sites, as the highly active ORR catalyst. The morphology and structure of the prepared materials were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). ZIF-8 exhibited a typical rhombic dodecahedron structure with a relatively smooth surface (Fig. S1a). After high-temperature pyrolysis to derive NC material, the surface became significantly rough, and the porosity increased noticeably (Fig. S1b). This might be attributed to the volatilization of Zn ion and the breaking and recombination of C–H, C–N, and N–H bonds. However, it is worth noting that even with direct rapid heating and calcination, the rhombic dodecahedron structure of ZIF-8 was well preserved, and there was no significant collapse, indicating its high stability. Therefore, when using NC as a suitable substrate to prepare FeSA/FeAC-NC, as shown in Fig. 1b, the morphology and structure of FeSA/FeAC-NC were basically consistent with NC, both exhibiting rough rhombic dodecahedron shapes. The FeSA-NC obtained through strong acid etching also maintained the rhombic dodecahedron shape (Fig. S1c). The morphology and microstructure of the FeSA/FeAC-NC (Fig. 1c) and FeSA-NC (Fig. S2a) catalysts were further explored using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both FeSA/FeAC-NC and FeSA-NC indeed exhibited a rhombic dodecahedral morphology with a rich porous structure, facilitating rapid mass transport during the ORR. Importantly, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of both FeSA/FeAC-NC (Fig. 1d) and FeSA-NC (Fig. S2b) did not reveal any discernible lattice fringes, indicating the absence of severe aggregation of Fe atoms into Fe nanoparticles. To ascertain the specific form of metal Fe in FeSA/FeAC-NC, aberration-corrected (AC) HAADF-STEM tests were performed, and the results are shown in Fig. 1e. The white bright spots on the carbon substrate were clearly observed in different regions and corresponding magnifications, indicating the coexistence of Fe atomic clusters (orange dashed circles) and single-atom dispersed Fe-N-C sites (green dashed circles). The average size of Fe clusters was approximately 1.0 nm containing 6–10 atoms, demonstrating their composition from multiple atoms and providing direct evidence for the coexistence of Fe single atoms and Fe clusters. Besides, the distance between Fe clusters and Fe single-atom was approximately 0.5–1.0 nm. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images of FeSA/FeAC-NC (Fig. 1f–i) with elemental distribution maps clearly demonstrated the uniform distribution of C, N, and Fe elements throughout the samples. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) revealed a Fe content of up to 2.39 wt% in FeSA/FeAC-NC (1.03 wt% in FeSA-NC), confirming the successful loading of high-density metal Fe onto the N-doped carbon substrate. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis is an important technique for determining the crystal structure. As shown in Fig. S3, the XRD pattern of ZIF-8 is consistent with previous literature reports, and the peak shapes are sharp, indicating good crystallinity [42–44]. Other NC, FeSA-NC, and FeSA/FeAC-NC catalysts all exhibit two broad diffraction peaks around 21° and 44° (Fig. 2 a), corresponding to the (002) and (101) planes of graphite carbon. The XRD patterns of FeSA/FeAC-NC and FeSA-NC do not show any diffraction peaks related to Fe, further confirming the absence of crystalline Fe particles, which is consistent with the HRTEM. Raman spectra of these various catalysts are shown in Fig. 2b. There are two distinct and predominant peaks at 1590 (G band) and 1345 cm−1 (D band) are clearly seen for all electrocatalysts. The intensity ratio (I D/I G) presents an indicator to evaluate the lattice distortion and crystallinity of the nano-architectures. Compare to NC, the FeSA/FeAC-NC catalyst displayed a lower I D/I G value (1.21), suggesting that it has a equivalent of graphitization and disorderliness. The deficiencies serve as catalytic centers, allowing for regulation of bonding energy and surface properties, as well as modulation and tuning of the electronic structures of the catalyst. This optimization leads to improved adsorption energies of electrocatalytic steps. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) pore diameter distribution and specific surface area of the obtained catalysts were further determined by nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiments. The specific surface area (665 m2 g−1) and total pore volume (0.37 cm3 g−1) of FeSA/FeAC-NC are smaller than that of NC (1108 m2 g−1, 0.54 cm3 g−1), which indicates that Fe atomic clusters and dispersed single Fe sites were successfully loaded on the NC substrate and occupied part of its pore structure. In addition, the isotherm curves (Fig. S4) further shows that FeSA/FeAC-NC has both micropore and small-sized mesopore structures. The presence of hierarchical micropores greatly enhances charge and mass transport during the ORR process, thereby improving the catalytic efficient and activity. To investigate the fine structure and local coordination environment of the Fe species in FeSA/FeAC-NC, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) tests, including X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were conducted. From the Fe K-edge XANES spectrum (Fig. 2c), it can be observed that the near-edge absorption threshold of FeSA/FeAC-NC is similar to that of FePc, lying between Fe foil and Fe2O3, but closer to Fe2O3. This indicates that Fe in FeSA/FeAC-NC exists in a higher oxidation state and is stabilized by N atoms. According to previous reports, the higher oxidation state of Fe is beneficial for the adsorption of oxygen and intermediates, as well as the desorption of products, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Additionally, a weak peak is observed at around 7115.32 eV in the pre-edge region of FeSA/FeAC-NC, which is typically attributed to the fingerprint of the square planar Fe-N4 configuration with a porphyrin-like structure [45]. This suggests that the coordination configuration of the single-atom Fe sites is similar to FePc. After Fourier-transformed (FT), the EXAFS spectrum (Fig. 2d) shows a main peak at around 1.50 Å in the R-space, which corresponds to the Fe–N scattering path, and a main peak at around 2.70 Å, indicating the presence of the Fe–Fe path [46,47]. This result suggests the coexistence of atomically dispersed Fe–N sites and Fe atomic clusters. Wavelet-transformed (WT) EXAFS is an effective method for distinguishing backscattering atoms. As shown in Fig. 2e and Fig. S5, there is a maximum intensity at around 3.97 Å−1 in the k-space of FeSA/FeAC-NC, which can be attributed to Fe–N scattering, and a second maximum intensity at around 6.42 Å−1, which corresponds to Fe–Fe scattering, confirming the existence of Fe clusters. Furthermore, the k value of the Fe-Fe scattering path in FeSA/FeAC-NC (approximately 6.42 Å−1) shows a significant negative shift compared to that of Fe foil (approximately 7.68 Å−1), suggesting a strong long-range electronic interaction between bulk Fe and Fe clusters. Both Fe clusters and single-atom Fe coexist in FeSA/FeAC-NC, and there is electronic interaction between them. Further analysis using EXAFS fitting in k-space (Fig. S6) and R-space (Fig. 2f) provides a clear understanding of the coordination configuration of Fe in FeSA/FeAC-NC. The best fitting result of FeSA/FeAC-NC shows that the single-atom Fe is coordinated with N atoms at a distance of 1.973 ±0.011 Å, with a coordination number (CN) of 4.1 ± 0.7, indicating the successful formation of the Fe-N4 configuration. Additionally, two various types of Fe–Fe localized bond configurations were present, with the CN of 1.1 ± 0.6 and 2.0 ± 0.2, and the bond lengths of 2.977 ± 0.026 Å and 3.429 ± 0.007 Å, respectively (Table S1). These results fully demonstrate the presence of singly dispersed Fe-N4 and Fe atom cluster composite structures in FeSA/FeAC-NC (inset of Fig. 2f). The best-fit results and quantitative structural parameters for the reference samples Fe foil, Fe2O3, and FePc can also be detailed in Fig. S7 and Table S1. For FeSA-NC control sample, the dominant presence of Fe–N bond in the EXAFS results also confirmed the atomic dispersion of the metal sites, which agrees with the HAADF-STEM results (Fig. S8). EXAFS fitting for the first shell coordination demonstrated that both Fe atom was coordinated with a coordination number of 4.0 ± 0.6, referred to as FeN4 site (Table S1). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to investigate the chemical composition and elemental valence states. The C 1s spectrum of FeSA/FeAC-NC exhibited an intense peak at about 284.8 eV, and it can be deconvoluted into three peaks, corresponding to C–C or CC, CN, and C–N species (Fig. S9a). The N 1s spectrum of FeSA/FeAC-NC and FeSA-NC can be deconvoluted into four peaks, corresponding to pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, and oxidized-N (Fig. S9b). The Fe 2p spectrum showed a Fe 2p 3/2 peak at 711.8 eV corresponding to Fe3+ (Fig. S10c), indicating the metal valence state was slightly higher than the XANES results due to the surface oxidization. For XPS spectra of FeSA-NC (Fig. S10d–f), the C 1s spectra showed similar results with FeSA/FeAC-NC. However, for the N 1s spectra, the concentration of different N species was different (Table S2). The electrocatalytic activity of the as-prepared FeSA/FeAC-NC toward ORR is evaluated in alkaline conditions. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were conducted using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique, as shown in Fig. 3 a and Fig. S10. Unlike under N2-saturated conditions, all catalysts exhibited a distinct cathodic reduction peak in the O2-saturated electrolyte, indicating their ORR catalytic activity. It is worth mentioning that the reduction peak potential of FeSA/FeAC-NC was at 0.85 V, which was the highest among NC (0.72 V) and Pt/C (0.83 V), and it also displayed the highest cathodic current. This result suggests that FeSA/FeAC-NC may be a potential high-performance ORR catalyst, and its peak potential was also improved compared to FeSA-NC (0.84 V), which can be attributed to the synergistic presence of Fe-N4 sites and Fe atom-clusters, effectively improving the ORR kinetics. Based on the LSV curves at 1600 rpm, the ORR activity of the prepared catalysts was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3b and c, FeSA/FeAC-NC exhibited the highest catalytic activity, with an onset potential (E onset) and half-wave potential (E 1/2) reaching 0.96 and 0.88 V, respectively. These values were 17 and 40 mV higher than the E onset (0.943 V) and E 1/2 (0.84 V) values of commercial Pt/C, and significantly superior to NC (E onset = 0.852 V, E 1/2 = 0.76 V) and FeSA-NC (E onset = 0.943 V, E 1/2 = 0.87 V). This result indicates that the synergistic presence of atomically dispersed single Fe-N4 sites and Fe atomic clusters plays a decisive role in enhancing the ORR activity. It is worth noting that FeSA/FeAC-NC exhibits ORR performance in alkaline media that is comparable to or even higher than other reported Fe-based catalysts in recent years (Table S3). Impressively, FeSA/FeAC-NC not only has the most positive E 1/2, but also achieves a kinetic current density (J k) of 15.38 mA cm−2 at 0.85 V, which is 69.9 times higher than that of NC (0.22 mA cm−2), 1.48 times higher than that of FeSA-NC (10.37 mA cm−2), and 4.6 times higher than that of Pt/C (3.34 mA cm−2), demonstrating its superior performance (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, the Tafel slope was used to understand the reaction kinetics in Fig. 3d. Compared to NC (76.18 mV dec−1), FeSA-NC (58.43 mV dec−1), and Pt/C (77.13 mV dec−1), FeSA/FeAC-NC exhibited the lowest Tafel slope (56.89 mV dec−1), indicating faster reaction kinetics [48,49]. These results effectively demonstrate that FeSA/FeAC-NC has faster reaction kinetics. The selectivity of the catalyst is an important indicator for catalyst research. Under O2 saturated conditions, LSV curves were recorded for speeds ranging from 400 to 2500 rpm, as shown in Fig. S10. According to the corresponding K-L plots (Fig. S11a1–d1), it was found that all catalysts exhibited good near-parallelism and linearity, indicating the existence of first-order kinetic processes. Meanwhile, the electron transfer numbers (n) of all catalysts were derived based on the K-L equation, in which FeSA/FeAC-NC showed an efficient 4e− reaction pathway similar to that of commercial Pt/C. In addition, the reaction path of FeSA/FeAC-NC was further verified by the RRDE testing technique, as shown in Fig. 3e and Fig. S12, the H2O2 yield of FeSA/FeAC-NC was lower than 11% and the electron transfer number (n) was close to 4, confirming that the ORR process followed the efficient four-electron reaction path. These results, along with the other catalyst testing results, are consistent with the aforementioned K-L analysis. To further confirm the importance of Fe active sites in ORR, poisoning experiments in Fig. 3f of FeSA/FeAC-NC were conducted using SCN− (10 mM) as a probe due to its strong affinity to Fe. The results revealed that the ORR activity of FeSA/FeAC-NC was severely deteriorated in the presence of potassium thiocyanate (KSCN), with a sharp decline in the limiting diffusion current density and a significant decrease of 151.5 mV in the half-wave potential. This result strongly indicates that the presence of Fe active-sites is a key condition for the high ORR activity of FeSA/FeAC-NC. Combined with the structural characterization using synchrotron radiation, it further demonstrates that the coexistence of single-atom and cluster can achieve surface electron rearrangement, thereby promoting the stronger ORR activity of active iron sites. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) reflects the number of exposed active sites of a catalyst and is used to evaluate the intrinsic activity of these sites. Therefore, to further analyze the source of the high ORR activity of FeSA/FeAC-NC, the ECSA of the corresponding catalysts was measured. As shown in Fig. S13a–c, the CV curves of FeSA-NC and FeSA/FeAC-NC were recorded in the potential range of 1.0–1.1 V under non-redox conditions, and their electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C dl) was determined to be 25.57 and 47.94 mF cm−2, respectively. From this, it can be inferred that the ECSA of FeSA/FeAC-NC is as high as 1198.5 cm2, which is 1.87 times that of FeSA-NC (639.25 cm2). This experimental result indicates that the presence of Fe clusters can greatly increase the number of active sites, which is beneficial for enhancing the ORR activity. Furthermore, it is worth noting that even after normalizing the LSV curves of FeSA-NC and FeSA/FeAC-NC with their respective ECSA, the E 1/2 of FeSA/FeAC-NC is still 10 mV higher than that of FeSA-NC (Fig. S13d). This suggests that the coexistence of single atoms and atomic clusters effectively enhances the intrinsic activity of Fe-N4 active sites. The stability of the catalysts is an essential condition for evaluating their practical application value. In accelerated durability tests (ADTs), the commercial Pt/C catalyst exhibited a significant decrease in E 1/2 of 15.5 mV after 5000 cycles (Fig. S14b). In contrast, the FeSA/FeAC-NC catalyst only showed a decrease of 4.1 mV (Fig. S14 a), indicating that FeSA/FeAC-NC has superior durability compared to Pt/C. Furthermore, long-term durability of FeSA/FeAC-NC was further confirmed through i-t testing. As shown in Fig. 3g, after continuous electrolysis for 44 h, FeSA/FeAC-NC exhibited a current decay rate of only 6%, while FeSA-NC show a decay rate of 14% after 36 h and 16% after 11 h of Pt/C, demonstrating the better long-term durability of FeSA/FeAC-NC. To comprehensively evaluate the excellent ORR performance of FeSA/FeAC-NC, methanol tolerance testing was also conducted. As shown in Fig. S13c, upon the addition of 3 mL of methanol in 0.1 M KOH, Pt/C exhibited a drastic decrease in current, indicating poor methanol tolerance. In comparison, the current of FeSA/FeAC-NC showed almost no decay, indicating its superior methanol crossover tolerance and high selectivity. Based on all the electrocatalytic experimental results mentioned above, it can be concluded that FeSA/FeAC-NC exhibits high ORR activity and strong stability in alkaline solutions, mainly due to the strong synergistic effect between Fe clusters and single Fe atomic sites. Inspired by the excellent electrocatalytic performance, we fabricated a zinc-air battery (ZAB) based on FeSA/FeAC-NC electrocatalyst as the air cathode and constructed a Zn-air battery (Fig. 4 a) with a liquid electrolyte containing 0.2 M Zn(Ac)2 and 6.0 M KOH. Consequently, the assembled battery displays an open circuit potential (OCP) up to 1.52 V, comparable to the commercial Pt/C-based cathode (Fig. 4b). The discharge polarization plots (Fig. 4c) illustrate that the FeSA/FeAC-NC-based Zn-air battery provides a higher discharge current with maximum power density of 205.7 mW cm−2, which is superior to the commercial Pt/C cathode (147.5 mW cm−2). Additionally, three FeSA/FeAC-NC-based Zn-air batteries arranged in series could steadily light up the red light-emitting diodes (LEDs, Fig. 4d) for several days, promising its potential application for electric energy storage devices. More importantly, galvanostatic discharge measurements were performed to show that, the FeSA/FeAC-NC-based zinc-air battery exhibited a discharge specific capacity of 807.5 mA h g−1, corresponding to ∼98.5% of the theoretical capacity (∼820 mA h g−1) which was higher than that of Pt/C (776.7 mA h g−1) (Fig. 4e). Further, as shown in Fig. 4f, the FeSA/FeAC-NC-based ZAB demonstrated a superior rate performance to its counterpart with Pt/C as air electrode. In additon, as shown in Fig. S15, FeSA/FeAC-NC has a lower OER overpotential and tafel slope than Pt/C, indicating faster reaction kinetics and mass transfer, which may enhance the charge process in ZAB performance. Gratifyingly, in 100 h of charge and discharge test, FeSA/FeAC-NC cathode has a lower charge and discharge voltage difference (<0.7 V) compared to commercial Pt/C (Fig. 4g). In order to further elucidate the synergistic mechanism between Fe single atoms and Fe atomic clusters, we conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the binding energies of reaction intermediates and their corresponding energy barriers during the ORR process for this structure. Two ideal structural models were constructed, including Fe single atoms (FeSA-NC) and a combination of Fe single atoms and Fe atomic clusters (FeSA/FeAC-NC) are constructed according to XAS and HAADF-STEM results for FeSA-NC and FeSA/FeAC-NC. (Fig. 5 a). The density of states (DOS) further demonstrates that there is no electron density near the Fermi level in the case of the FeSA-NC in Fig. 5b. In addition, Fig. S16 shows the magnetic saturation of the applied magnetic field is about 10 kOe. FeSA/FeAC-NC shows typical ferromagnetic properties at 300 K, and the saturation magnetic susceptibility of the FeSA/FeAC-NC is 0.17 emu g−1, which is contributed by FeAC, and regulating the spin properties of FeN4 site. Conversely, the FeSA/FeAC-NC exhibits pronounced electron density near the Fermi level, indicating the existence of free electrons upon the introduction of iron clusters. Moreover, an analysis of projected density of state (PDOS) the Fe sites in Fe-N4 sites in Fig. 5c both FeSA-NC and FeSA/FeAC-NC reveals that the introduction of iron clusters effectively enhances the electronic activity of Fe-N4 at the Fermi level, inducing increased electron activity at the Fe-N4 sites, thereby facilitating the enhancement of the ORR process [50,51]. The ORR process for FeSA/FeAC-NC is depicted in Fig. 5d. By calculating the binding energies of intermediates O2*, OOH*, O*, and OH* at the Fe site within the Fe-N4 site for FeSA-NC and FeSA/FeAC-NC, which involves a 4-electron ORR pathway, we obtained energy diagrams at 1.23 V, as depicted in Fig. 5e. The rate-determining step for ORR on the Fe-N4 site is the formation of OH* (O* + H+ + e− = OH*) with an energy barrier of 0.44 eV. When introducing the iron cluster, due to the electronic interaction of FeAC with Fe-N4, it enhances the adsorption energy of OH*, effectively optimizing the energy barrier for OH* formation, significantly reducing the limiting energy barrier to 0.31 eV, thus improving the ORR catalytic reaction kinetics. 3 Conclusions In summary, this work achieved the coexistence of FeSA and FeAC through confined pyrolysis, which was further elucidated by aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM and XAS measurements. Through the combination of experimental and theoretical calculations, it was demonstrated that FeAC could influence the electronic properties of Fe-N4 sites, optimizing the formation energy of OH*, thus enhancing the ORR process. FeSA/FeAC-NC exhibited excellent ORR activity and stability in alkaline conditions. This work elucidates the significance of introducing metal clusters into single-atom catalysts as a crucial means to regulate active centers, which could inspire the exploration of more efficient single-atom electrocatalysts and provide insights into the performance optimization of atomic electrocatalysts.

        "dc:description": "The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) could be effectively regulated by adjusting electron configurations and optimizing chemical bonds. Herein, we have achieved the modulation of electron distribution in Fe single atomic (FeSA) sites through Fe atomic clusters (FeAC) via a confined pyrolysis approach, thereby enhancing their intrinsic ORR activity. X-ray absorption spectroscopy has confirmed that the presence of iron atomic clusters could influence the electron distribution at Fe-N4 sites. The FeSA/FeAC-NC catalyst exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.88 V, surpassing the individual FeSA-NC structure. Through electronic structure analysis, it could be seen that iron atom clusters can affect Fe-N4 sites through long-range effects, and then effectively lower reaction barriers and enhance the reaction kinetics at Fe-N4 sites. The synthetic approach might pave the way for constructing highly active catalysts with tunable atomic structures, representing an effective and universal technique for electron modulation in M-N-C systems. This work provides enlightenment for the exploration of more efficient single-atom electrocatalysts and the optimization of the performance of atomic electrocatalysts. Furthermore, a zinc-air battery assembled using it on their cathode deliver a high peak power density (205.7 mW cm−2) and a high-specific capacity of 807.5 mA h g−1. This study offers a fresh approach to effectively enhance the synergistic interaction of between Fe single atom and Fe atomic clusters for improving ORR activity and energy storage.",
