The titanates with various morphologies and structures, e.g. nanoparticle (NP), nanotube (NT), nanowire (NW), nanorod (NR) and fragment (FR), were successfully synthesized in this paper, which were subsequently utilized as supports for CeO2 in selective catalytic reduction of NO. Experimental results revealed that Ce/NP, Ce/NT and Ce/FR samples were highly active, whilst Ce/NW and Ce/NR samples showed very poor performance. We proposed that the difference in their performances was mainly originated from the resulting chemical states of CeO2, which were induced by the nature of titanate supports, i.e. special surface properties and unique structures and morphologies. Graphical abstract Highlights ► Ceria was doped on titanate supports with various morphologies. ► The varied chemical state of ceria was the key factor influencing SCR performance. ► Inappropriate titanate morphology could lead to poor performance of ceria. ► Advanced structures led to high surface area and special ammonia adsorption. Keywords SCR Titanate nanotube Cerium oxide NO conversion 1 Introduction The control of NOx emission from flue gasses was a continuing challenge due to the increasing impact on environment from urban smog, acid rain, ozone depletion, and greenhouse effect [1]. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) process with ammonia has been commonly recognized as one of the most desirable and attractive ways for NOx removal. Although V2O5/TiO2-based catalysts have been extensively employed in commercial SCR processes [1–3], the drawbacks associated with toxicity of vanadium pentoxide to environment, over-oxidation of NH3 and formation of N2O in high temperature range still remain [4]. Ceria supported on titanate nanoparticle (Ce/TiO2) were reported to be environment-friendly deNOx catalysts with good activity and N2 selectivity in the temperature range of 275–400°C [5–7]. However, researchers have been still seeking to further improve the SCR performance of Ce/TiO2. For example, Chen et al. found that the addition of tungsten to Ce/TiO2 catalyst could bring more adsorption species for NOx and NH3, and simultaneously enhanced the catalytic activity for NH3-SCR [8]; Bayleta et al. investigated the NOx reduction activity over different ceria/sulphated TiO2 catalysts, which indicated that the deNOx activity increased with sulfate contents [9]. Besides these, another potential way to improve the performance of Ce/TiO2 catalyst is changing the structure of titanate support [7]. Nowadays, a variety of one-dimensional (1D) titania/titanate nanostructures have been synthesized and widely used as catalyst supports due to their unique electronic and optical properties [10–15]. For example, titanate nanotube have been proposed being able to facilitate the adsorption of reactants on their active surface sites and were widely used as photo-catalysts, due to the high surface-to-volume ratio [10,11,14]; titanate nanowire have been considered as superior structures for charge transport, beneficial to sensing applications [14,16,17]; titanate nanorod have numerous structure defects, which are an interesting factor in lithium rechargeable batteries [14,18–20]; etc. Since less attention has been paid to the different titanate structures/morphologies influencing on the SCR activity of CeO2, this paper dealt with the effects of various titanate supports, e.g. nanoparticle, nanotube, nanowire, nanorod and fragment on the performance of CeO2 in SCR of NO. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst preparation Titanate nanoparticle (NP) used in the present study were commercially available P25 (Degussa, Germany). Titanate nanotube (NT) and titanate nanowire (NW) were prepared by hydrothermal treatment of P25 TiO2 with 10N NaOH solution [15,21]. The introduction of cerium onto NP, NT and NW was conducted by wet-impregnation method. Ceria loaded titanate fragment (Ce/FR) was made via an in-situ method, where an appropriate amount of cerium nitrate solution was added to TiO2/NaOH mixture for hydrothermal treatment. The Ce/NT, Ce/NW, Ce/NP and Ce/FR samples were all calcined at 450°C for 3h. Ceria loaded titanate nanorod (Ce/NR) were prepared by calcining the mixture of cerium nitrate solution and titanate nanotube (that was dried at 80°C) at 550°C for 2h. The loading amount of Ce was designed to be 1:19 (Ce/Ti molar ratio), which was an optimized loading by our preliminary experiments [7]. Catalyst preparation details were presented in Supplementary data S1. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The crystal phases of samples were analyzed by using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD: model D/max RA, Riga ku Co., Japan; Cu Kα radiation, 0.15418nm). XPS (Thermo ESCALAB 250, USA) was used to investigate surface properties. The morphology, structure and grain size of samples were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM: JEM-2010; Tecnai G2 F20). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface area (SBET) was determined by using a nitrogen adsorption apparatus (ASAP 2020, USA). All samples were degassed at 200°C prior to measurements. H2-TPR and NH3-TPD were carried out on a custom-made TCD setup, details of which are present in Supplementary data S2. 2.3 SCR activity measurements Selective catalytic reduction of NO with NH3 was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor, in which 0.5g of catalyst was filled. The typical reactant gas composition was as follows: 600ppm NO, 600ppm NH3, 3.5% O2 and balance N2. Gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was about 100 000h−1 for this system. NO, NO2, N2O and O2 concentration were monitored by an infrared gas analyser with a O2 sensor (Photon II, Madur Electronics, Austria). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Morphology and structure investigations XRD patterns of each sample are shown in Fig. 1 . The peaks belonged to anatase (PDF-#21-1272) phase (at 2θ=25.28°, 37.80°, 48.05°, 53.89°, 55.06° and 62.69°) and rutile (PDF-#21-1276) phase (at 2θ=27.45°, 36.09° and 54.32°) were clearly observed in Ce/NP sample, which unsurprisingly given the characteristic XRD peaks of P25. For Ce/NT sample, the main crystal phase was an intermediate tunnel structure of H2Ti12O25 [22,23], which transformed to anatase phase of Ce/NR sample (via a calcination at 550°C for 2h during the preparation). For Ce/NW sample, the peaks located at 2θ=24.7°, 44.1° and 47.9° could be indexed as the characteristic peaks of sodium titanate [16], probably in the form of Na2Ti3O7 (PDF-#31-1329), whereas extra peaks centered at 2θ angles of 31.7, 45.4 and 56.5° could be corresponding to the characteristic peaks of NaCl (PDF-#05-0628), originated from the ion exchange of Na+ with H+ [16,17]. Another two distinct peaks at 2θ=28.5° and 33.1° belonged to CeO2 (PDF-#43-1002) were also observed in Ce/NW sample. The main crystal phase of Ce/FR was anatase, together with some rutile phase and CeO2. Amongst these samples, the Ce/NW revealed the most intense CeO2 peaks, implying a better crystallization of CeO2 on wire-like TiO2 support. From the HR-TEM images shown in Fig. 2 , it is clearly seen that the expected morphologies of titanate supports had all been successfully obtained. A perfect tubular morphology of Ce/NT could be seen in Fig. 2(a), which was with an outer diameter of 8–10nm, inner diameter of ca. 3nm and length of several hundred nanometers. As being reported previously [7,24], the vast majority of ceria were present inside the channels of NT, maintaining Ce/NT as condensed layered titanante-H2Ti12O25 structure. The size of TiO2 particles in Ce/NP sample was observed to be varied from 10 to 40nm (Fig. 2(b)), whilst the average diameter of CeO2 particles was measured at about 5.1nm. For Ce/NR sample (Fig. 2(c)), due to the nanorod being severely aggregated, CeO2 particles were covered up and hardly to be recognized. For Ce/NW sample, the length of nanowire could even reach ca. 3μm and the size of CeO2 particles was at 15–30nm. The particle size of ceria in Ce/NW sample was much larger than that in other samples, indicating that ceria crystallites could prefer to grow on nanowire support. From Fig. 2(e), it can be seen that Ce/FR sample contained numerous titanate fragment with different shapes and sizes, which were originated from the delaminated TiO2 crystallites during alkali treatment [21,25]. Ceria particles with 5–10nm size were dispersed on the fragment. Curiously, a small amount of nanoribbons, single-layer sheets and nanotube was also found in this sample. 3.2 BET and XPS BET surface areas were correlated well with the structure and morphology of titanate supports. Ce/NT sample had the largest surface area of 222.1m2/g. High temperature annealed Ce/NR sample had a relatively low surface area at 82.2m2/g. Ce/NW sample with solid wire structure showed an extremely low surface area of 16.1m2/g, which was even much lower than that of Ce/NP (48.2m2/g). Ce/FR sample had a complex morphology and structure, showing a surface area of 94.3m2/g, which is larger than that of Ce/NP, but smaller than that of Ce/NT. XPS was conducted to identify the surface nature and atomic concentration of various elements in the samples. It was observed that the surface concentration of Ce in Ce/NT sample was much lower than other samples. Our previous reports [24] had revealed that once CeO2 particles entered into tubular channels, the XPS could only detect the outside Ce and part of inside Ce due to the thickness of NT wall (at 2–3nm) that is very close to the penetration depth of XPS. The photoelectron spectra of Ce 3d levels are displayed in Fig. 3 . Peaks denoted as u, u2, u3, v, v2 and v3 were attributed to Ce4+ species, whilst u1and v1 were assigned to Ce3+ species [26,27]. For Ce/NT, CeNP and Ce/FR samples, Ce3+ and Ce4+ were all coexisted. In comparison, Ce/NR sample had very weakened Ce3+ peaks, which were even nearly disappeared in Ce/NW sample. It is well known that Ce3+ mainly came from lattice defects and was accompanied by the formation of oxygen vacancies [28–30]. Furthermore, the lattice defects increased with the decrease of ceria particle size [29,30]. On the basis of XRD and TEM results, the CeO2 particles in Ce/NW sample were very big and ceria in Ce/NR sample was covered up by aggregated nanorod. This was attributed to the disappearance of Ce3+ in this sample. 3.3 Reducibility of cerium species Fig. 4 shows H2-TPR profiles of each sample. It was extensively accepted that the reduction of CeO x occurred first on surface at low temperature range and then progressively affects the bulk at high temperature range [31,32]. Only Ce/NT, Ce/NP and Ce/FR samples revealed reduction peaks below 500°C, attributing to the reduction of surface chemisorbed oxygen (induced by oxygen vacancies) [31–33]. This is in accordance very well with XPS analysis. In contrast, Ce/NW and Ce/NR samples had sharp peaks at high temperature range (>500°C). These reduction peaks could be attributed to the total reduction of ceria by elimination of O2− anions of crystal lattice, forming Ce2O3 [31,32]. 3.4 SCR activity and discussion Fig. 5 reveals the NO conversion over each sample. It was observed that N2O (a potential by-product of the SCR of NO) was hardly detected at any temperatures for all the samples, which indicated that ceria catalysts had very high N2 selectivity [5]. When reaction temperature exceeded 400°C, the NO conversion decreased, which was mainly caused by the oxidation of NH3 [1,7,34]. As shown in the figure., Ce/NP, Ce/NT and Ce/FR samples had much better activities than Ce/NR and Ce/NW samples. Previous reports mainly ascribed the importance of ceria in catalysis to its remarkable redox and oxygen storage capability [33]. However, the activity of ceria was controlled not only by oxygen storage capability but also by the rates of Ce4+/Ce3+ redox cycles [33]. Though the rate of Ce oxidation was much faster, the reduction of Ce was generally sluggish [33]. As discussed in previous studies [28–30,33], the reduction of ceria was proposed to be controlled by the nature of oxygen vacancies, which coexisted with Ce3+. From our characterizations as shown above, Ce/NT, Ce/NP and Ce/FR samples had the presence of Ce3+ whilst Ce/NR and Ce/NW samples did not. That was to say, the redox cycles could go on more smoothly in Ce/NT, Ce/NP and Ce/FR samples, resulting in better SCR activities. The nature of titanium supports could influence the chemical state of Ce by their special surface properties and unique structures and morphologies. Generally, the higher surface area of the supports, the better dispersion of the CeO2 could be obtained. The highly dispersed CeO2 could effectively restrain its crystal growth, leading to the formation of more defects and the increase of Ce3+. This could be well proved by the quite different chemical state and particle size of CeO2 in Ce/FR and Ce/NW samples, which showed surface areas at 94.3 and 16.1m2/g, respectively. Furthermore, the unique tubular channels of titanate nanotube were also beneficial to the inhibition of CeO2 crystal growth. Once CeO2 particles entered into tubular channels, the growth of ceria could be greatly inhibited by the wall of nanotube. Besides, the nanotube could also result in a confinement effect for inside CeO2 [35], leading to a particular low reduction peak at around 450°C for Ce/NT sample (see TPR results). In addition, besides the redox property of CeO2, the dynamics also influenced the SCR performances of respective samples, especially the adsorption of ammonia. Amongst them, Ce/NT sample showed the strongest ammonia desorption peaks ranging within 200–700°C (see Supplementary Fig. S1), which was mainly corresponded to the successive desorption of physisorbed or chemisorbed ammonia. Based on previous research, the special adsorption in Ce/NT sample might be due to the higher binding energies of NH3 molecules in the interior of titanate nanotube [35], leading to an enrichment of NH3 molecules inside the channels compared with the exterior. This increased local concentration of reactants could help accelerate the reaction rate and yielded a high activity. 4 Conclusions Ceria loaded on titanates with various morphologies and structures in the application of SCR of NO had been systematically studied in this paper. It can be concluded that the inappropriate morphologies (e.g. NW) could result in high crystalline and large particle size of ceria whilst the advanced structures (e.g. NT) could lead to high surface area and special ammonia adsorption, which are all linked strongly to the chemical states of ceria (correlated with the redox cycle), leading to different performances in SCR reaction. We expect that the work conducted herein could provide valuable guideline to the development of better TiO2 based catalysts.
