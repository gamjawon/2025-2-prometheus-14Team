The potassium promoted (K/Cr = 0.1) catalysts have also been examined. The supported chromia has been found active in the ODH of isobutane at relatively low temperatures 200-400, the total activity and selectivity to isobutene depending on the nature of the support and the potassium presence. The highest selectivities to isobutene (ca. 70% at 5% conversion) and the isobutene yields of ca. 9% have been obtained for CrO,./TiO2 and K-promoted CrQ./AI203 preparations. Keywords: Supported chromia catalysts; Oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane 1. Introduction To provide for an ever increasing demand of isobutene, the key reactant for production of MTBE or of methacrylates, the oxidative dehydrogenation, ODH, of isobutane can be envisaged as an alternative for the catalytic dehydrogena- tion. This latter reaction, commonly used in industry to produce isobutene has several disadvantages such as the high reaction temperature, the catalyst deacti- vation by coke formation and consequent need for periodic catalyst regeneration in air. All these disadvantages could be avoided in the case of exothermic oxidative dehydrogenation. There are only few papers in the literature concerning the ODH of isobutane [1-3]. Lysova et al. [1] report the ZnO-TiO2 system as active and selective in * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/96/$15.00 Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII S0926-860X(96)00117-2 336 R. Grabowski et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 335-34l ODH of isobutane at 570, the maximum yield of isobutene being 54%. Takita et al. [2] have found various metal pyrophosphates effective at high temperatures in this reaction. Ni2P207 was most active and selective, with an isobutene maximum yield of about 9% at 550. Recently Pt-coated ceramic foam monoliths have been shown to catalyze the reaction [3], yielding at low contact times (ca. 5 ms) and at 800-900 a mixture of isobutene and propene (1:1); isobutene yields of 25-30% were reported. In the present work chromium oxide supported on various oxide carriers has been tested in the ODH of isobutane. The work has been stimulated by the fact that chromia systems are known to be active in the isobutane dehydrogenation [4], alumina supported chromia being used in the industrial catalyst for this process. Moreover, we have recently found that chromia and zinc-chromium oxides supported on anatase TiP2 are active in the ODH of propane, the highest yield of propene (ca. 8%) being observed for the CrzO3/TiO2 catalyst [5]. 2. Experimental i The catalysts were obtained by impregnation with an aqueous solution of chromium nitrate (p.a., POCh, Poland) of a support, followed by drying for 5 h at 120 and calcination in a flow of air at 500. The following supports were used: AI203 (activated, basic, Aldrich), TiP[ anatase (Chemical Works, Police, Poland), TiPn anatase (Yioxide), SiP2 (Degussa), ZrO2 (p.a., Reachim,), MgO (pure, Reachim). The amount of chromium introduced corresponded to 10 Cr atoms per nm2 of the support surface. Potassium (a well known promoter of both dehydrogenation and oxidation catalysts) was introduced by adding the appropriate amounts of KNO3 to the chromium nitrate solution, the molar ratio K/Cr being equal to 0.1. The list of the studied catalysts and their characteristics are given in Table 1. The values of the specific surface areas of the catalysts are in most cases close to those of the supports, with the exception of the CrOx/MgO preparations, which have a much higher specific surface area than the magnesia support. The treatment of the magnesia with water, followed by evaporation and drying in the same conditions as in the preparation of the catalyst, showed the formation of microcrystalline Mg(OH)2, as verified by the XRD technique. Under calcination the magnesium hydroxide decomposed into MgO which has a higher specific surface area than the original support. This could explain the observed changes of the specific surface area in the CrOx/MgO catalysts. The XRD analysis showed the presence of Cr203 only in the case of CrOJSiO2. No crystalline Cr203 was observed in other catalysts what suggests a high dispersion of chromia or amorphicity. Catalytic activity of isobutane was measured in a fixed bed flow reactor in the temperature range 200-460; 1 ml of catalyst, grain size 0.63-1 mm was used, R.

The reaction mixture contained 9.2 vol.-% of isobutane (Phillips Petroleum Corp., 99%) in air. Analysis of products was performed by on-line gas chromatography. The details of the experimental set-up were given in [6]. The blank test showed no conversion of isobutane up to 450 in the empty reactor made of stainless steel. The supports were found practically inactive (yield of isobutene was ten times lower than in the case of corresponding catalyst for conversion up to 40%). The catalysts were tested at each temperature for about 4 h during which the activity was constant. Isobutene, CO2 and CO were the main reaction products. Small amounts (ca. 1% of the total amount of products) of hydrocarbons C ~-C2 were also observed -- with the exception of CrOJMgO. No oxygenated products were detected. 3. Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the changes of the total conversion of isobutane and selectivities to main reaction products with the reaction temperature for one of the studied catalysts (K-CrOx/TiO~). A similar course of changes has been observed for other preparations. The increase in the total conversion of isobutane with the increase in the reaction temperature is accompanied by the decrease in the selectivity to isobutene and the increase in the selectivity to carbon oxides. Such a behaviour is typical for the selective oxidation reaction and may be due the consecutive mechanism of the formation of COx from the intermediate product-isobutene, at high conversion of isobutane. On the other hand, as a rule, higher activation energies, for the COx formation in parallel route as compared with those for the formation of the selective oxidation products, may also account for the fact that COX are the predominant products at higher reaction 338 R.

The kinetic studies at different temperatures now in course should decide between these two possibilities, and determine the contribution of consecutive and parallel paths of the COx formation. The formation the COx in the consecutive path (by the olefin oxidation) may have comparable activation energies to those of the isobutene formation, the latter step involving rupture of the strong alkane C-H bond. Similar [7] or lower [8] values of the activation energy for olefin combustion as compared to the olefin formation from alkanes have in fact been observed for the propane ODH reaction. Table 2 gives the values of the activation energy for the isobutane consump- tion, Ea, the overall reaction rates at 300 evaluated from the Arrhenius plots for the studied catalysts, and the total activity per 1 Cr atom (TOF), calculated with the assumption that all deposited chromium atoms are exposed on the support surface. Table 3 presents selectivities to isobutene at 5, 10 and 20% of the isobutane conversion and temperatures at which these conversions were recorded. Maximum yields of isobutene, obtained in the adopted reaction conditions, and temperatures at which these yields were observed are also given. Most of the studied preparations are active already at low temperatures (240-300) with the exception of magnesia supported chromia and K- CrOJSiO2 which attain conversions comparable to other preparations at 360- 450. The intrinsic activity of chromia species and the Ea values depend on the type of the support, the highest intrinsic rates at 300 being observed for titania, zirconia and alumina supported catalysts.

The effect of the K additive on the activity can be positive or negative depending on the type of the support. The high selectivities to isobutene for CrOx/TiO2 and K-CrO,./A1203 preparations which exhibit also high TOF's reveal them as quite promising catalysts for the ODH of isobutane. It should be noted, that in contrast to the best catalysts reported for ODH of propane, VMgO [9,10] and NiMoO4 [11], which are active at temperatures above 500, the chromia-based catalysts described in this work are active in the isobutane ODH in the temperature range close to that of the olefin oxidation. They could be applied in conjunction with the isobutene oxidation catalyst to obtain the oxygenated products (methacrolein and methacrylic acid) from isobutane in one reactor.

Grabowski et al. //Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 335-341 Any discussion on the correlations between the catalytic performance in the isobutane ODH and the nature and physicochemical properties (e.g. acido-basic- ity) of the support seems to be premature, the more so, as even for the support of the same nature (e.g. TiO2); the activity and the selectivity depend on the provenance of the support and its specific surface area. To explain the effect of the support nature and of the K-promoter the studies are envisaged to character- ize the type and properties of dispersed CrOx species on different supports, and eventually to formulate the structure of the active sites. 4. Conclusions (1) Supported chromium oxides can be promising catalysts for ODH of isobutane, being active and selective at relatively low temperatures 200-400. (2) Catalytic performance of supported chromia depend on the nature of the support, and can also be affected by the presence of the potassium promoter. The intrinsic activity of the chromia species on different supports at 300 decreases in the order: TiO2 > ZrO2 = A1203 > SiO2 > MgO and for the K-promoted (K/Cr = 0.1) samples in the order: KTiO2 > KZrO2 = KA1203 ~> KSiO2 = KMgO (3) The highest selectivities to isobutene (ca. 70% at 5% conversion) and the highest isobutene yields (ca. 9%) have been found for CrOx/TiO: (low specific surface area anatase) and K-promoted CrOx/A1203 preparations.
