Department of Chemistry Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad 45320 Pakistan Graphical abstract Density Functional Theory calculations were carried out to study CO oxidation by lattice oxygen atoms of Au10/TiO2 (001) catalyst. The variation in ΔG° with temperature and the barriers associated with the elementary reactions were calculated. The Mars Van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism starts with the CO oxidation by lattice oxygen atoms located at the periphery of Au10 on Au10/TiO2 system. The variation in ΔG° indicates that the process is spontaneous at all the temperatures studied and requires 53kJ/mol activation barrier. The CO2 desorption, as result of this oxidative process, leaves a surface oxygen vacancy at the perimeter of Au10/TiO2 which is refilled in the subsequent O2 adsorption step. The variation in ΔG° for adsorption of O2 showed that the adsorption process is spontaneous until 420K. Dissociation of O2 into O+O is an exothermic process and activated by a small activation barrier (30kJ/mol). The second cycle of CO oxidation is even more probable, having a lower activation barrier and high exothermicity. While the ΔG° for CO oxidation by lattice oxygen atoms is negative on Au10/TiO2, it is positive from 100 to 650K on Au3/TiO2 and clean TiO2 (001) surfaces, respectively. Thus, CO oxidation by MvK mechanism on Au/TiO2 catalysts depends upon the size/dispersion of the Au cluster. Since, Au cluster facilitates CO oxidation by MvK mechanism, therefore, MvK mechanism is expected to take place together with the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism on Au/TiO2 catalysts. Keywords Heterogeneous catalysis Au/TiO2 CO oxidation DFT Mars-van Krevelan mechanism 1 Introduction After the ground breaking work of Haruta et al. [1] on CO oxidation by Au nanoparticles, CO oxidation is one of the most widely studied reactions [2,3]. Nanoparticles of Au when supported on reducible oxides like CeO2, TiO2, Fe2O3 and Co3O4 show extremely high reactivity for CO oxidation. Although, a lot of work has been published on CO oxidation on bare as well supported Au catalysts, several aspects of CO oxidation on Au or Au/support catalysts are still unresolved. Assignment of the reactive oxygen required for CO oxidation is one of the unresolved aspects of CO oxidation on Au/support catalysts. With respect to CO oxidation on Au/TiO2 (Au/rutile) most of studies were devoted to understand the role of the active sites [4,5], the support [2,3,6,7], the size/shape of the Au nanoparticles [8–10] and charge transfer between Au/support [11]. However, the role of lattice O atoms of the oxide towards the oxidative process (i.e. Mars Van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism) has been given the least attention, particularly, for Au/TiO2 catalysts. Moreover, the nature of the reactive oxygen for oxidative processes is also unresolved yet. In principle, there are three mechanisms by which CO oxidation on Au/oxide catalyst is considered to take place; (1) both CO and O2 adsorb at Au nanoparticles (the gold only mechanism) [12]; (2) reaction occurs at Au/oxide interface (the interface mechanism) [5,13] and (3) CO adsorbs at the Au/TiO2 interface and reacts with the lattice oxygen [14]. While the former two mechanisms represent Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, the latter is the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism (MvK). The MvK mechanism has three distinct elementary reactions, namely, the first CO oxidation cycle using lattice oxygen atoms of the oxide support, the adsorption of O2 at the vacancy produced during the oxidation process and the second CO oxidation process using the O-atom produced by the dissociation of O2 adsorbed at the vacancy. Although, the former one has got much more attention, the later one is the least investigated mechanism. Besides, the dominant mechanism of CO oxidation on Au/oxide nanoparticles is unresolved yet. The choice of the anatase (001) was made purposefully. As discussed above, a lot of work has been done with respect to the catalytic/photocatalytic application of Au/rutile. However, very little is known about the catalytic application of Au/anatase and among the different phases of anatase, the (001) facet has been least investigated. Based on the electronic structure (pDOS and HOMO-LUMO), it has been proposed that Au/TiO2 (001) is a better catalyst for CO oxidation than Au/TiO2 (101) [15]. One might wonder that the minority surface might diminish during crystal growth and the percentage of (001) phase would be negligible compared to dominant (101) phase. However, it has been shown that up to 90% (001) dominated anatase TiO2 crystals could be prepared with potential applications in lithium ion batteries, photo-decomposition and hydrogen formation [16–18]. Therefore, we think our work might provide some insights into application of anatase (001) in CO oxidation. Considering the role of surface oxygen vacancies, Haruta [19] have suggested that molecular oxygen is activated at the perimeter of Au/TiO2 catalyst. Although, most of the previous studies suggest that molecular oxygen adsorbed at the Au/TiO2 interface is the possible reactive source of oxygen [12,20–22], Maeda et al. [23] and Widmann and Behm [24,25] have recently shown that Au/TiO2 perimeter lattice oxygen atoms are easily accessible for CO oxidation and could be the source of reactive oxygen. However, detection of the reactive oxygen during CO oxidation is difficult in in situ. In this regard, we investigated the formation of O vacancy on the Au10/TiO2 catalysts in our recent work [7], where we have shown that the lattice oxygen atoms present at the periphery of Au on Au10/TiO2 can be activated thermally. Our work suggested that CO oxidation could take place by MvK mechanism on Au/TiO2 catalysts. The purpose of current work was to analyze the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of this mechanism on Au/TiO2 system. 2 Computational details 2.1 Methodology We have used Quantum Espresso (Q-E) package [26] to perform DFT [27,28] calculations in planes waves basis set and periodic boundary conditions. We make use of Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials [29] and GGA-PW91 approximation [30,31] to deal with the ion-core interactions and exchange correlation energy, respectively. Although the use of vdW approximation [32–34] and hybrid potentials [35,36] improve the calculated parameters, nevertheless, the GGA-PW91 functional has been shown to give computational results which are close to the experimental ones [37,38]. Besides this, the GGA+U formalism has been successfully used to address the problems relevant to self-interactions [15,39,40]. Therefore, to make the calculations affordable computationally along with good accuracy, GGA+U formalism was used to address the self-interaction errors as discussed elsewhere [40,41]. The cut offs for wave function and charge density were 40 and 400 Ry, respectively. The convergence criteria for forces were ≤0.05eV/Å per atom. The model for anatase TiO2 (001) (hereafter referred as TiO2) surface was represented with a 6 monolayer p(3×3) unit cell having a vacuum gap of >20Å to separate the periodic slabs. The reciprocal space was sampled only by Γ-point. Although, we have used Γ-point sampling, a test calculation with 2×2×1 k -points sampling was also done to see if the energy variation is converged or not. Indeed the energy variation was converged and independent of k -points sampling. The energy difference between 2×2×1 and 1×1×1 k -points sampling was −0.003 Ry. The original tetragonal anatase unit cell was used to calculate the lattice parameter and Monkhorst-Pack method [42] was used to sample its reciprocal space with a (8×8×3) k -points grid. The optimized values (3.81 and 9.47 Å), which are close to experimental values (3.78 and 9.5 Å) [43], were used to construct slab models in which bottom half of supercell was frozen and the upper half was allowed to relax during CO oxidation calculations. For creating Au10/TiO2 model system, we used same procedure as found in previous work [7]. The fractional occupancies for these metallic systems were represented by first-order Methfessel-Paxton smearing-function with a width of ≤0.1eV [44]. Search for the transition states (TS) was made using the climbing-image nudged elastic band (cNEB) method [45,46] and then confirmed by calculating vibrational frequencies. As GGA is known to overvalue the binding energy of O2 and poorly describes the localized electrons on reduced TiO2, a Hubbard correction was introduced [41,40] with a value of 4eV as proposed by Ortega et al. [47] Spin polarized calculations were performed for O2 molecule with a 10×12×14Å3 orthorhombic unit cell. DFT+U calculations were performed for obtaining the electronic energy. However, the phonons were calculated by DFT calculations as the Q-E does not support DFT+U phonons calculations [27,28]. Although, there may be some errors associated with phonons part due to the neglect of the effect of the localized electrons, nevertheless, no reports have been published on the vibrational free energy differences between TiO2 and TiO2 with a vacancy (TiO2(vac)). 2.2 Calculation of thermodynamic functions Thermodynamic functions for the elementary reactions were calculated using the vibrational data. The contribution from the lattice thermal vibrations and the zero-point energy (ZPE) to the total energy has also been taken in to account [7,48–51]. For calculating the Gibbs free energy variation, the vibrational data for stoichiometric and reduced TiO2 was taken from our previous work [7]. The Gibbs free energy variation for all the elementary steps was computed according to the equation: ΔG =∑Gp −∑Gr The indices p and r refer to the products and reactants, respectively, and G = H −TS, with H the enthalpy and S the entropy of the system. The enthalpy and entropy are calculated differently for solid and molecular systems. In the solid state they are calculated according to the following equations [52]: Hs (T)= Eelec + EZPE + Evib (T) Ss (T)= Svib (T) Gas phase molecules, on the other hand, are treated according to the method described previously [51]. The enthalpy of an ideal gas is calculated as follows [52]: Hg (p,T) = Eelec + EZPE + Evib (T) + Erot (T) + Etrans (T) + pV, where, Erot (T) and Etrans (T), are the rotational and the translational contributions to the enthalpy, respectively. The entropy of an ideal gas is calculated using the equation Sg (p,T) = Strans (p,T) + Srot (T) + Svib (T). The variation of Gibbs free energy was calculated for all the elementary steps from 100 to 650K temperature range at a pressure of 1 atmosphere. All the expressions for enthalpy and entropy terms could be found in our previous works [7,48–51,53]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Thermodynamics of CO(g) +Au/TiO2 →Au/TiO2(vac)+CO2(g) reaction The oxygen atoms of the Au/TiO2 can be divided in two groups. (1) Oxygen atoms bridging Ti atom with Au (interface oxygen atoms (OInt)) and (2) oxygen atoms bridging two Ti atoms at the periphery of Au (perimeter oxygen atoms (OPeri)), as shown in Fig. 1 a, and discussed in our previous work [7]. As the Au/TiO2 has different oxygen atoms, it is essential to distinguish those oxygen atoms which could be used for oxidizing CO. For this, we first calculated the variation in ΔG° for the reaction CO(g) +Au/TiO2 →Au/TiO2(vac)+CO2(g) using OInt and OPeri for the oxidation reaction. The results are shown in Fig. 2 . The condition for stable intermediate(s) is that the intermediate(s) should have the negative Gibbs free energy. The variation in ΔG° suggests that CO oxidation by OInt seems difficult thermodynamically. The intermediate formation is non-spontaneous from 100 to 650K. Initially, the ΔG° decreases, but starts increasing above room temperature (298.15K) in a flat manner. The situation is quite different when one looks at the variation in ΔG° for other two cases. Lattice oxygen atoms at the periphery of Au (Operi) have negative free energies from 100 to 650K. This suggests that the oxygen atoms of Au/TiO2 which bridge Au cluster with support (TiO2 in this case) would not participate in oxidation reactions whereas the lattice oxygen atoms which are near the periphery of Au on Au/TiO2 are helpful for oxidative reactions. These results verify the experimental works [23–25] which show that the turn over frequency for CO oxidation scales up with the length of the periphery of Au/TiO2. For instance, Widmann et al. [24,25] have noted that reactivity of the catalyst depend upon the size of the periphery and temperature. They suggested that the lattice oxygen atoms at the periphery of Au/TiO2 are reactive oxygen for CO oxidation. Since the activity of catalyst was increasing with the increase in temperature, they suggested that at high temperatures, thermally induced diffusion of surface oxygen vacancies takes place. Although, we could show that the perimeter oxygen atoms could be used for oxidative purposes, we were unable to compute the thermodynamics of oxygen atoms which are away from the Au cluster due to the small size of supercell. Nevertheless, the work of Widmann et al. suggest that at high temperature, the oxygen atoms away from the periphery migrate to the periphery from where they are subsequently removed by CO (Fig. 3 ). 3.2 Role of size of Au cluster In previous section, we concluded that the OPeri are activated and could be used for oxidative processes on Au10/TiO2 catalysts. To see if this trend is general for all Aun/TiO2 catalysts or is limited to some selected Au clusters, we did additional calculations, in which the variation in ΔG° was calculated for CO oxidation by lattice oxygen atoms of Au3/TiO2 and clean TiO2 catalysts. Details of model Au3/TiO2 and clean TiO2 catalysts are available elsewhere [7]. The results are shown in Fig. 2. The variation in ΔG° shows that the process is non-spontaneous for TiO2 in the range of the temperature investigated. A slightly similar result was found for Au3/TiO2 case. While CO oxidation by OPeri on Au10/TiO2 has negative ΔG°, the ΔG° is positive for same situation on Au3/TiO2. Nevertheless, the values of ΔG° at all temperatures are lower for Au3/TiO2 than for clean TiO2 catalysts. This shows that OPeri of Au3/TiO2 and any lattice oxygen of clean TiO2 can not oxidize CO by MvK mechanism; the process is practicable on Au10/TiO2 catalysts only. Thus, the stability of the formed (intermediate) oxygen vacancy could be varied by varying the size/dispersion of nanoparticles of Au. Moreover, presence of Au cluster is essential for CO oxidation by MvK mechanism. Therefore, we suggest that an Au assisted MvK mechanism is possible on Au/TiO2 catalysts. However, it depends upon size of the Au cluster and different sized Au clusters supported on TiO2 may not oxidize CO using OPeri. This is consistent with our previous work on oxygen defect formation on TiO2, Au3/TiO2 and Au10/TiO2 systems [7] and other reported works on CO oxidation on Au/support [54–56]. For instance, Li et al. [57] have used Born-Opennheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) to study CO oxidation on Au16/TiO2 and Au18/TiO2 catalysts. They observed that Au16/TiO2 is active for MvK mechanism; however, LH mechanism is more favorable on Au18/TiO2. They have explained this difference on the basis of fluxionality of Au cluster. In a similar way, Duan and Henkelman [39] found that for a periodic Au rod placed on TiO2, both LH and MvK mechanism are possible. Reaction of CO with lattice oxygen atoms is not limited to Au/TiO2 catalysts only. Au/CeO2 has also been shown to oxidize CO by MvK mechanism. For example, Au3/CeO2 was found to be highly active for oxidizing CO by Mv-K [58]. The above mentioned evidences suffice to argue that the participation of lattice oxygen atoms for CO oxidation might not be ruled out. We suggest that the stability of formed oxygen defect could be used as a criterion to judge whether MvK mechanism is possible on a certain Aun/oxide catalysts or not. By this analogy, we were able to show that clean TiO2 and Au3/TiO2 can't oxidize CO by MvK while Au10/TiO2 can. Although, the effect of agglomeration of the smaller clusters to the larger clusters was not considered, reports suggest that large nanoparticles of Au are also reactive and have been discussed elsewhere [25,39,57]. It is interesting to note the charge loss or gain upon formation of oxygen vacancy. For this, Bader charges [59,60] were computed for the formation of oxygen vacancy upon removal of OInt or OPeri on Au3/TiO2 and Au10/TiO2 systems. Table 1 shows the difference in Bader charges for Au atoms once the vacancy is formed. For each Au atom, the charge was calculated before and after the vacancy formation and the differences (Au/TiO2(vac)−Au/TiO2) are shown in Table 1. The difference in the net charge for Au3 cluster corresponds to 81.4% of the charge in Au10 cluster when the vacancy is formed in the cluster interface. For vacancy formation on the cluster perimeter, this difference in Au3 corresponds to 39.3% of that found in Au10. So, even in the case that the modification is not directly connected with the cluster, Au10 has clearly more capacity to act as a stabilizer. The results also suggest that to have more Au atom near the vacancy is the key to cumulate more charge in the cluster and stabilize the intermediate structure. 3.3 The Au assisted mars-van krevelen mechanism In previous section, we suggested that MvK mechanism could take place on Au10/TiO2 catalysts. The MvK mechanism involves following reaction steps: Reaction Remarks CO(g) +Au/TiO2 →Au/TiO2(vac)+CO2(g) 1st cycle of MvK mechanism Au/TiO2(vac)+O2 →O2- Au/TiO2(vac) O2 adsorption on Au/TiO2(vac) CO+O- Au/TiO2(vac)→CO2 +Au/TiO2 2ndcycle of MvK mechanism 2CO+O2 →2CO2 Over all reaction Where, the Au/TiO2 represents the stoichiometric catalyst while the Au/TiO2(vac) represents the catalytic surface with one O-atom vacancy. ΔG°, ΔH° and −TΔS° and reaction barriers were computed for the elementary reactions shown above. 3.3.1 1st cycle of MvK mechanism For the 1st cycle of CO oxidation, the variation in ΔG° has been discussed in the preceding sections. Here, we only report the calculated values of ΔG°, ΔH° and −TΔS° at room temperature (298.15K) which are −180, −67 and −113kJ/mol, respectively. To compute the kinetics of first cycle of CO oxidation, adsorption of CO on different positions of Au10/TiO2 catalyst was investigated. The calculations indicate that CO tends to bind most strongly at the top of Au cluster with adsorption energy (Eads) of −123kJ/mol. The CO and CAu bond lengths were 1.15Å and 1.92Å, respectively. However, CO adsorbed at this site can not react with the lattice O atoms without diffusion near to lattice O. To react with lattice O-atoms, CO should either be adsorbed at a Ti or an Au site near the lattice oxygen. Placing CO at any Ti atom revealed a very week interaction. However, CO adsorption at AuTi bridge (Fig. 1b and c) near the lattice O was found to be stable with Eads of −67kJ/mol. This can be achieved at high partial pressure of CO. The calculated CAu, CTi and CO bond lengths are respectively, 2.44, 2.27 and 1.15Å. The distance of C of CO from the lattice O was found to be 2.61Å. CO2 formation from CO adsorbed on Au/Ti bridge involves formation of an OCO intermediate (Fig. 1f). Formation of the intermediate is activated by 53kJ/mol and with reaction energy 40kJ/mol. (Relative to the adsorbed CO) The transition state (TS) for OCO intermediate formation is shown in Fig. 1d and e. The first cycle completes with CO2 desorption from OCO. The desorption step is exothermic by 76kJ/mol, relative to adsorbed OCO. (Exothermic by 36kJ/mol relative to adsorbed CO) Hence, CO oxidation produces an oxygen vacancy at the periphery of Au on Au/TiO2 catalyst. Similar barrier has been reported on Au supported on rutile surface [39,57]. As the barrier associated with CO2 formation is small and the reaction is highly exothermic, CO oxidation by MvK mechanism seems possible on Au/TiO2 catalysts. The formation of CO2 leads to a surface oxygen vacancy leaving excess electrons at the Au and Ti atoms near the oxygen vacancy [47]. We calculated Bader charges [59,60] to see the electron transfer between Au and TiO2 as the reaction proceeds. Bader charges were calculated for CO-Au/TiO2 and OCO-Au/TiO2. Bader charges on Au/TiO2 and Au/TiO2(vac) have already been discussed in our previous work [7]. When the Au cluster adsorbs on TiO2 support, it is slightly oxidized by losing electrons (ē) to TiO2. Upon adsorption of CO molecule at the Au/TiO2 interface, the Au cluster draws ē from incoming CO and is reduced by 0.2 ē, with no charge being distributed to O or Ti atoms near the Au/TiO2 interface. However, with the formation of OCO intermediate, the charge transfer reverses. The C atom, which initially was oxidized, is reduced by drawing ē from the Au cluster. The charge on C atom reduces from 2.34 ē in CO-Au/TiO2 to 1.96 ē in the OCO-Au/TiO2 complex, the Au cluster in turn being oxidized. With the desorption of CO2 from OCO intermediate, the Au cluster is reduced again along with small charge being distributed to Ti atoms in the vicinity of the O-defect. Thus, Au cluster acts a pool of ē. The Au cluster changes its oxidation state during the reaction. This charging/discharging of Au plays an important role in the catalytic activity of Au/support catalysts. A similar situation has also been observed by Li and Zeng [57]. 3.3.2 Adsorption of O2 on the oxygen vacancy Following the completion of first catalytic cycle for CO2 formation, adsorption of O2 was examined at the defect produced in the previous cycle. The adsorption of O2 on the reduced Au10/TiO2 catalyst regenerates the stoichiometric form with an extra O atom. The configuration for molecular adsorption is shown in Figs. 1h and 1i. Molecular oxygen adsorbs on the vacancy site at right angle to the surface normal. The OTi bond on either side was found to be 1.86Å. The O2 is activated during its adsorption at the vacancy resulting in 1.39Å OO bond length, which reveals significant molecular bond activation (gas phase OO bond length is 1.24Å). The O2 adsorption energy is −163kJ/mol at 0K. The Fig. 2 shows the variation in ΔG° for adsorption of molecular oxygen. The adsorption process is spontaneous until 420K. The values of ΔG°, ΔH° and −TΔS° at room temperature are −52, −195 and 143kJ/mol, respectively. However, beyond 420K, the intermediate (O vacancy) becomes more stable than adsorbed oxygen, indicating that the reaction will be slowed down above this temperature. Following the adsorption of molecular oxygen, its dissociation into 2 oxygen atoms (O+O co-adsorption) was also examined. The optimized configuration of dissociated O2 is shown in Fig. 1k. The dissociated atoms are indicated by blue arrows. One oxygen atom fills the vacancy while the second one forms an interface with Au and Ti. The O atom which fills the vacancy has symmetric OTi bond lengths (1.82Å). The O atom which makes an interface with Au and Ti has AuO and AuTi bonds lengths of 2.03 and 1.72Å, respectively. The dissociative process is activated by a minor barrier of 30kJ/mol (see Fig. 1j for TS). The dissociation of O2 is an exothermic process. We note that the exothermicity of the process increases (more negative reaction energy) with increasing the temperature. For example, at 0K, the reaction energy is −69kJ/mol while at 298.15K, the value is close to −71kJ/mol. Thus, the thermodynamics and the kinetics of O2 adsorption and dissociation process indicate that the process is highly probable on the Au/TiO2 catalyst. 3.3.3 2nd cycle of CO oxidation (CO oxidation by atomic oxygen) Fig. 2 shows the variation in ΔG° for the 2nd cycle of CO oxidation calculated with respect to gas phase CO and O2 adsorbed on Au/TiO2(vac). The variation in ΔG° shows that the process is spontaneous at all the studied temperatures. At room temperature, the values of ΔG°, ΔH° and −TΔS° are −327, −261 and −65kJ/mol, respectively. Thus, second cycle of CO oxidation is highly feasible on Au/TiO2 catalysts. The MvK mechanism of CO oxidation completes with the reaction of CO with O atom produced in O2 adsorption step. Initially, co-adsorption of COO was examined. Fig. 1m and n show the co-adsorption configuration of COO. The CO adsorbs on an Au atom close to O-atom adsorbed at Au/Ti bridge. Height of the CO relative to O-atom is 2Å. Formation of CO2 from COO is activated by 35kJ/mol (the TS is shown in Fig. 1o) and highly exothermic (–268kJ/mol) relative to adsorbed COO. Thus, lattice O atoms at the periphery of Au10 on the Au10/TiO2 could be removed by CO in one step and replenished in subsequent oxygen adsorption step. Our observations substantiate the experiments which suggest that the lattice O atoms of TiO2 near the periphery of Au could be used for CO oxidation [23–25]. 3.4 Reactive oxygen (O) for CO oxidation There has been a continuing debate in academia about the source of reactive oxygen for CO oxidation on Au/oxide catalysts. For CO oxidation, there could be a reaction between CO and O2 (either in molecular form or in dissociated form, The Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism) in which oxide only acts as support for anchoring the Au cluster and sometime molecules, also. Conversely, the support can actively take part in the reaction by providing lattice oxygen atoms for oxidative purpose, as a bifunctional catalyst (The Mars-Van Krevelen Mechanism). It was shown that O2 could be adsorbed on the Au/TiO2 catalyst below 77K which then could be removed by CO [61]. However, this molecularly adsorbed O2 desorbs at 170 K [22,62] indicating a different reaction mechanism at high temperatures. Recently, Kotobuki et al. [63] suggested that the length of the Au/TiO2 periphery is important for OSC (Oxygen storage capacity). They suggested that the OSC scales up with periphery of Au/TiO2 and consequently the CO oxidation. They noted that the reactive oxygen needed for oxidation could be adsorbed at 353K (80°C) which is stable against desorption. It is hard to imagine that the active oxygen species detected by Kotobuki et al. [63] is the molecularly adsorbed oxygen because the experiments of Steihl et al. [22,62] have shown that O2 desorbs at 170K. One can argue that at low temperature, molecular oxygen represents reactive oxygen for oxidative reactions, however, beyond room temperature, the situation remains unresolved. However, recent works [24,25] suggest that the perimeter oxygen atoms of the Au/TiO2 are reactive oxygen for CO oxidation. On the theoretical side, controversy still exists about the assignment of the reactive oxygen for CO oxidation [39,57]. In our previous work, we had shown that formation of surface oxygen vacancy is thermally induced process on Au/TiO2 [7]. Our previous work and the current one strongly suggest that MvK mechanism can take place and the source of reactive oxygen species is the lattice oxygen atoms of Au/TiO2 near the periphery of Au/TiO2. Since Au is necessary to initiate CO oxidation by MvK mechanism, therefore, a gold assisted MvK mechanism would occur alongside the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism on the Au/TiO2 catalysts. These observations are consistent with the previous theoretical and experimental works, as discussed elsewhere [25,39,57,58]. The Au cluster undergoes small deformations during CO oxidation; however, these deformations do not destroy the basic three dimensional semi-pentagonal geometry of the Au cluster, the structure remains identical during the reaction. The deformations of metal cluster in a reaction are referred as the fluxionality of the cluster. This fluxionality of the Au cluster has been shown to be responsible for the activating lattice oxygen atoms for CO oxidation. More robust clusters (Au18/TiO2, for instance), which do not undergo deformations, have been shown to be active for LH mechanism [57,58]. Therefore, it can be safely concluded that fluxionality of Au cluster plays an important role in activating the lattice oxygen atoms for CO oxidation. 4 Conclusions CO oxidation by Mars-Van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism on Au10/TiO2 was investigated by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. The variation in ΔG° with temperature was calculated for the elementary reactions associated with MvK mechanism. Initially, clean TiO2 surface, Au3/TiO2 and Au10/TiO2 catalytic systems were investigated thermodynamically to check their activity. It was found that only Au10/TiO2 was active for oxidative reaction advocating that only particular sized Au clusters are active. On the Au10/TiO2 catalyst, the MvK mechanism starts with the CO oxidation by lattice oxygen atoms located at the periphery of Au10. The variation in ΔG° indicates that the process is spontaneous at all the temperatures studied with a small activation barrier (53kJ/mol). CO2 desorption leaves a surface oxygen vacancy at the perimeter of Au10/TiO2. The formed vacancy is replenished in the subsequent O2 adsorption step. The variation in ΔG° for adsorption of O2 showed that the adsorption process is spontaneous until 420K. Dissociation of O2 into O+O is exothermic process and activated by a nominal activation barrier (30kJ/mol). The second cycle of CO oxidation is highly exothermic (−268kJ/mol) and activated by a minute barrier of 35kJ/mol. Consequently, it is proposed that practically a gold assisted (as Au is necessary to initiate CO oxidation) MvK mechanism will compete the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism on the Au/TiO2 catalysts.

        "dc:description": "Density Functional Theory calculations were carried out to study CO oxidation by lattice oxygen atoms of Au10/TiO2 (001) catalyst. The variation in ΔG° with temperature and the barriers associated with the elementary reactions were calculated. The Mars Van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism starts with the CO oxidation by lattice oxygen atoms located at the periphery of Au10 on Au10/TiO2 system. The variation in ΔG° indicates that the process is spontaneous at all the temperatures studied and requires 53kJ/mol activation barrier. The CO2 desorption, as result of this oxidative process, leaves a surface oxygen vacancy at the perimeter of Au10/TiO2 which is refilled in the subsequent O2 adsorption step. The variation in ΔG° for adsorption of O2 showed that the adsorption process is spontaneous until 420K. Dissociation of O2 into O+O is an exothermic process and activated by a small activation barrier (30kJ/mol). The second cycle of CO oxidation is even more probable, having a lower activation barrier and high exothermicity. While the ΔG° for CO oxidation by lattice oxygen atoms is negative on Au10/TiO2, it is positive from 100 to 650K on Au3/TiO2 and clean TiO2 (001) surfaces, respectively. Thus, CO oxidation by MvK mechanism on Au/TiO2 catalysts depends upon the size/dispersion of the Au cluster. Since, Au cluster facilitates CO oxidation by MvK mechanism, therefore, MvK mechanism is expected to take place together with the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism on Au/TiO2 catalysts.",
