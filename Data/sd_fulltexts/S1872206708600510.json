Asymmetric Reduction of Ethyl 4-Chloro-3-oxobutanoate to Ethyl (S)-4-Chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate Catalyzed by Aureobasidium pullulans in an Aqueous/Ionic Liquid Biphase System ZHANG Fan 1 , NI Ye 1 , SUN Zhihao 1, *, ZHENG Pu 1 , LIN Wenqing 2 , ZHU Po 2 , JU Nianfeng 2 1 Key Laboratory of Industrial Biotechnology, Ministry of Education, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, China 2 Porton Corporation, Chongqing 401121, China Abstract: The asymmetric reduction of ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (COBE) to ethyl (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate ((S)-CHBE) catalyzed by Aureobasidium pullulans CGMCC 1244 was performed in an aqueous/ionic liquid biphase system to improve the productivity and optical purity of (S)-CHBE. The influences of reaction parameters such as shaking rate, phase volumetric ratio, reaction temperature, initial substrate concentration, and pH were studied. In the aqueous/[bmim]PF 6 biphase system and under the optimum reaction conditions of 30 °C, pH 6.6, rotation speed 180 r/min, and reaction time of 8 h, the conversion of COBE, the enantiomeric excess, and the concentration of (S)-CHBE were 95.6%, 98.5%, and 47.1 g/L, respectively. When the substrate was fed in batches under the condition of pH 6.6, the accumulated product concentration could reach up to 75.1 g/L. Key words: ionic liquid; whole cell; Aureobasidium pullulans; ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate; asymmetric reduction; ethyl (S)-4-chloro-3- hydroxybutanoate The stereoselective reduction of ethyl 4-chloroacetoacetate (COBE) to (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate ((S)-CHBE), a chiral building block in the pharmaceutical industry, can be catalyzed by various microbial cells [1–5]. However, COBE is poorly soluble in the aqueous reaction medium and/or has toxic effects on the biocatalyst. A two-phase aqueous/organic reac- tion system can be used to prevent these problems by mini- mizing its concentration in the aqueous phase. At the same time, the inhibitory effect of the ketoester on the biocatalyst is reduced [6]. Multiphase processes have been developed in an attempt to restore process efficiency in such cases, but com- monly used organic solvents are often toxic to the cells, flammable even explosive, and environmentally harmful [7]. Ionic liquids (ILs) are substances that are completely com- posed of ions and liquid at or close to room temperature. In- terest in these compounds, which are often heralded as the green, high-tech media of the future, is still increasing rapidly and stems from their near-zero vapor pressure, thermal stabil- ity, and widely tunable properties as regards polarity [8]. As functional materials, they are being used in a wide variety of applications such as chemical engineering, synthesis, catalysis, batteries, fuel cells, biotechnology, and analytical science. In recent years, ILs for biotechnology applications have attracted increasing attention [9–12]. In contrast to organic solvents, ILs are able to not only increase the enantioselectivity and enzyme stability but also reduce the toxicity of the substrate. The product from the reduction of prochiral ketone can also be easily extracted from the system. Recent studies have shown that organic solvents can be substituted by ILs as the reaction media in many applications. Several recent excellent reviews on this subject are available [13–17]. It has been reported by Pfruender et al. [13,16] that the asymmetric synthesis of (S)-CHBE with Saccharomyces cerevisiae FasB His6 and 100 mol/L NADP + was performed in an aqueous/ILs system containing 20% (v/v) [bmim]PF 6 . This process resulted in an increase of enantiomeric excess (ee) from 61.7% to 83.9% and ZHANG Fan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(6): 577–582 in chemical yield from 44.4% to 80.2%, compared to the use of n-butyl acetate in the solvent system. Whereafter they found that the productivity of (S)-CHBE was increased 13-fold to 20 g/(L·h) with 99% of conversion and 99.7% of ee in an aque- ous/[bmim]PF 6 biphasic system by recombinant Escherichia coli. A fungus, Aureobasidium pullulans CGMCC 1244, has been used to reduce COBE to (S)-CHBE with high activity and excellent stereoselectivity [18]. The asymmetric reduction of COBE to (S)-CHBE catalyzed by the whole cells of A. pullu- lans CGMCC 1244 in an aqueous/organic solvent biphasic system was studied in our laboratory. Under the optimum conditions, the maximum concentration of (S)-CHBE in the organic phase, the conversion, and the optical purity reached 56.8 g/L, 94.5%, and 97.7% ee, respectively [19]. In the present work, the use of ILs as reaction media for the asymmetric reduction from prochiral ketones to chiral alco- hols, such as COBE, has been established as a new method to increase the regioselectivity and the conversion. Compared to the asymmetric reduction in an aqueous/nonaqueous solvents biphasic system or a monophasic aqueous system, the re- gioselectivity and the conversion were increased significantly after choosing the right types of ILs and optimizing reaction parameters such as shaking rate, volumetric phase ratio, reac- tion temperature, and pH. 1 Experimental 1.1 Microorganism and cultivation A. pullulans CGMCC 1244 was preserved at China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC). The culture medium contains: maltose, 30 g/L; yeast extract, 20 g/L; peptone, 5 g/L; (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 5 g/L; KH 2 PO 4 , 2 g/L; and MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O, 0.7 g/L. The pH was adjusted to 6.0 with 0.5 mol/L Na 2 CO 3 . The cultivation was carried out in a 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 80 ml medium at 30 °C and 180 r/min in a rotary shaker at a speed of 180 r/min. After 24 h cultivation, A. pullulans CGMCC 1244 cells were harvested by centrifugation (8000 r/min, 10 min) at 4 °C and washed twice with deionized water. 1.2 Partitioning of COBE and CHBE in an aqueous/ nonaqueous solvent biphasic system In 10 ml of a test organic solvent or IL, COBE and CHBE (0.22 mmol of each) were shaken with 10 ml potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 mol/L, pH 6.6) at 30 °C for 1 h in a closed vessel. The concentrations of COBE and CHBE in each phase were determined by gas chromatography (GC) as de- scribed below. Triplicates were run for each trial. P was defined as the partition of COBE or CHBE between nonaqueous and aqueous phases. 1.3 Expression of the metabolic activity retention In order to compare the metabolic activity retention of sev- eral organic solvents and ILs, the reduction reaction was car- ried out in the aqueous/organic solvent or IL biphasic system (1:1 (v/v)) at 30 °C and 180 r/min for 24 h with 100 g/L of A. pullulans CGMCC 1244 cells (wet cell weight). The metabolic activity retention of A. pullulans CGMCC 1244 cells after 24 h exposure to organic solvents or ILs was used to express its solvent tolerance. The metabolic activity retention was defined as R = R 1 /R 0 u 100%, where R 1 is the amount of consumed glucose after 4 h cultivation in glucose solution by cells that has been soaked in organic solvents or ILs for 24 h, R 0 is the amount of consumed glucose after 4 h cul- tivation in glucose solution by cells that has been soaked in sterile water for 24 h, and R is metabolic activity retention (%). According to the formulae, the larger the metabolic activity retention, the higher the solvent tolerance of cells [20]. 1.4 Asymmetric reduction of COBE in a monophasic aqueous system The reaction mixture, comprising a certain amount of wet cells and 0.5 g glucose in 10 ml potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 mol/L, pH 6.6), was added into a 50 ml Erlenmeyer shaking flask capped with a septum. After pre-incubation in a water-bath shaker at 180 r/min and 30 °C for 30 min, a certain amount of COBE was added and the incubation was continued. Samples were taken periodically and centrifuged (8000 r/min, 10 min) at 4 °C to remove the cells. The supernatant (5 ml) was extracted with 1 ml ethyl acetate for GC analysis. 1.5 Asymmetric reduction in an aqueous/ILs solvent biphasic system The reaction mixture, comprised of a certain amount of wet cells and 10% glucose in a certain volume of a selected buffer (0.1 mol/L, citrate buffer with pH 4.5–6, potassium phosphate buffer with pH 6–7.5, and Tris-HCl buffer with pH 7.5–9), was added into a 50-ml Erlenmeyer shaking flask capped with a septum. After pre-incubation in a water-bath shaker at a se- lected temperature and shaking rate for 30 min, 5 ml ILs and a certain amount of COBE was added and the incubation was continued. Samples were taken periodically and centrifuged (8000 r/min, 10 min) at 4 °C to remove the cells. The concen- trations of COBE and CHBE in the nonaqueous phase layer were determined directly by a gas chromatograph. The aqueous layer (5 ml) was extracted with 1 ml ethyl acetate which was analyzed by GC. 1.6 Analytical methods of GC The concentrations of COBE and CHBE were determined ZHANG Fan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(6): 577–582 using a gas chromatograph (Varian GC3900, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a CP WAX 52CB capillary column (30 m, i.d. 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 mm). For the determination of ee, CHBE was converted into the corre- sponding acetate by reaction with an excessive amount of acetic acid anhydride contained pyridine at 100 °C for 1 h according to the published work [21]. GC analysis of the ace- tates was performed using a chiral column (CP-Chirasil Dex CB, 25 m, i.d. 0.25 mm, Varian, USA). 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Biocompatibility of cells in ILs The larger the metabolic activity retention is, the higher the solvent tolerance of cells is. In order to validate whether ILs are suitable for the biphasic biotransformation, the toxicity assay was conducted. As shown in Fig. 1. Compared with the aqueous phase and several organic solvents, [bmim]PF 6 and [bmmim]PF 6 had excellent biocompatibility. As shown in Table 1, [bmim]PF 6 and dibutylphthalate were found to be more suitable as non-aqueous phases because of their high production yield and optical purity of the product. Although the optical purity of the product was maintained in a range of 96.1%–97.3% ee in other solvents, the lower conversions were observed. This might be because of the unfavorable partition, resulting in substrate and/or product inhibitory effect on the biocatalyst. The soluble ILs of [bmim]MeF 3 and [bmim]BF 4 had low conversion rate. Because [bmim]PF 6 showed higher production yield and optical purity of product, it was selected as the nonaqueous phase for the asymmetric reduction of COBE to (S)-CHBE in this study. 2.2 Effect of phase ratio on asymmetric reduction in aqueous/[bmim]PF 6 system For biotransformation in an aqueous-organic solvent bi- phasic system, the volumetric phase ratio influences the phase interfacial area, which in turn affects biotransformation rate [22]. The appropriate phase ratio could result in increased cell activity. As shown in Fig. 2, the volumetric ratio of the aqueous phase to the nonaqueous phase (V a /V o ) had a noticeable effect on the reaction rate and the conversion but hardly affected the Table 1 Asymmetric reduction results of COBE catalyzed by Aureobasidium pullulans CGMCC 1244 in different sys- tems System LogP (COBE) LogP (CHBE) Conversion (%) ee (%) Aqueous — — 35.9 96.1 Aqueous/dibutylphthalate 0.79 0.60 90.0 96.6 Aqueous/hexane 0.18 � 0.58 38.7 96.9 Aqueous/[bmim]PF 6 1.87 1.14 94.2 96.6 Aqueous/[bmmim]PF 6 1.02 0.73 50.1 97.3 Aqueous/[bmim]BF 4 0.54 0.28 32.0 97.3 Aqueous/[opy]BF 4 a — — — — Aqueous/[bmim]MeF 3 a — — — — P: Partition of COBE or CHBE between non-aqueous and aqueous phases.

ZHANG Fan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(6): 577–582 optical purity of the product. When the volumetric phase ratio was 1/1, the conversion and product concentration were the highest (conversion 91%, ee 96.7%). 2.3 Effect of shaking rate and temperature on asymmetric reduction in aqueous/[bmim]PF 6 system Shaking rate is known to influence the mass transfer diffu- sion and partition of the substrate and the product. The initial reaction rate and the conversion were significantly enhanced by the increase of shaking rate, which had little effect on the optical purity of the product. The initial reaction rate and the conversion increased almost linearly with the increase of shaking rate until 180 r/min and there was no more further increase after that. Thus, the appropriate shaking rate was set at 180 r/min. Temperature has an important influence on activity, stereo- selectivity, and stability of the biocatalyst as well as on the equilibrium of a reaction [23]. The initial reaction rate and the conversion reached maximum at 30 °C in the asymmetric reduction of COBE to (S)-CHBE. Lower or higher temperature caused a drop in the initial reaction rate and the conversion but had little influence on the optical purity (conversion 90.5%, ee 97.5%). 2.4 Effect of pH on asymmetric reduction in aqueous/ [bmim]PF 6 system Buffer pH can affect conversion and optical purity of the product [24]. As shown in Fig. 3, at lower or higher pH, the conversion and the initial reaction rate decreased probably because of the enzymic inactivation. Higher values of conver- sion were achieved in a pH range of 6–7. The highest conver- sion and initial reaction rate were obtained at pH 6.6 (conver- sion 91.6%) but pH had little influence on the optical purity (96.7% ee–98.4% ee). 2.5 Effect of substrate concentration on asymmetric reduction in aqueous/[bmim]PF 6 system The capacity of batch conversion of COBE to CHBE was greatly enhanced in the biphasic system. When the concentra- tion of COBE was 292 mmol/L, the maximum conversion and the maximum product concentration were 95.6% and 47.1 g/L, respectively (Fig. 4). The conversion and product concentra- tion reduced rapidly when the COBE concentration was higher than 292 mmol/L. This might be due to the excessive substrate leading to an inhibitory effect on the cells. In order to further increase the product concentration, batch conversion with substrate adding was performed. The pH was controlled at 6.6 using 2 mol/L NaCO 3 , and 200 l COBE was added at 2, 6, and 8 h, respectively (Fig. 5). The highest conversion and CHBE concentration were 97.5% and 75.1 g/L, respectively. Fig. 4. Effect of substrate concentration on the asymmetric reduction of COBE. Substrate concentration (mmol/L): (1) 146; (2) 219; (3) 292; (4) 369; (5) 438.

ZHANG Fan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(6): 577–582 2.6 Comparison of asymmetric reduction in monophasic aqueous and aqueous/[bmim]PF 6 systems Generally, mass transfer limitations can be observed in a biphasic system. However, the reaction rate in the aqueous/ILs biphasic system was faster than that in the monophasic aqueous system as shown in Fig. 6. Compared with the aqueous/organic solvent biphasic system [19], the use of [bmim]PF 6 as the substrate carrier not only increased the biocatalysis of whole cells but also reduced the substrate inhibition in the biphasic system, thus resulting in a higher conversion in the aqueous/ILs biphasic system. After 8 h reaction, the conversion reached 95.6% in the aqueous/ILs biphasic system. Simultaneously, the optical purity of the product was 98.5%. 2.7 Reuse of ionic liquids in the biphasic system The high cost of ILs greatly limits its industrial applications. Therefore, how to effectively recycle the used ILs becomes an important issue. Here, the recycling of the used ILs in the biphasic system was studied. As shown in Fig. 7, no obvious change was observed in both the conversion and the optical purity (conversion 96.7%–92.1%, ee 98.4%–96.4%) after [bmim]PF 6 was recycled six times. There could be find a method of recycling ILs in reusing ILs in further studies. 3 Conclusions The use of ionic liquids effectively increased the conversion and product ee of asymmetric reduction of COBE to (S)-CHBE catalyzed by the whole cells of A. pullulans CGMCC 1244. The hydrophobic IL [bmim]PF 6 had excellent biocompatibility, and an enhanced catalytic ability was observed in the aque- ous/[bmim]PF 6 system, which was consistent with previous studies. The optimum shaking rate, volumetric phase ratio, reaction temperature, pH, and initial substrate concentration were 180 r/min, 1/1, 30 °C, pH 6.6, and 292 mmol/L, respec- tively. Under these conditions, the conversion, optical purity, and product concentration were 95.6%, 98.5%, and 47.1 g/L respectively. While the substrate was added in batches with pH maintained at 6.6, the accumulated product concentration reached 75.1 g/L. However, the reuse of the expensive IL re- mains an important issue. Our preliminary results showed that the [bmim]PF 6 could be efficiently recycled. The use of ILs in industrial biotransformation has prosperous future due to their “green solvent” features such as non-toxic, nonvolatile, and Fig. 5.

Tel/Fax: +86-510-85918252 The asymmetric reduction of ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (COBE) to ethyl (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate ((S)-CHBE) catalyzed by Aureobasidium pullulans CGMCC 1244 was performed in an aqueous/ionic liquid biphase system to improve the productivity and optical purity of (S)-CHBE. The influences of reaction parameters such as shaking rate, phase volumetric ratio, reaction temperature, initial substrate concentration, and pH were studied. In the aqueous/[bmim]PF6 biphase system and under the optimum reaction conditions of 30 °C, pH 6.6, rotation speed 180 r/min, and reaction time of 8 h, the conversion of COBE, the enantiomeric excess, and the concentration of (S)-CHBE were 95.6%, 98.5%, and 47.1 g/L, respectively. When the substrate was fed in batches under the condition of pH 6.6, the accumulated product concentration could reach up to 75.1 g/L.
