When these alkoxides are treated with pure sulfuric acid (100% by weight) in a stoichiometric ratio, the catalytic activity is strongly increased initially but it decreases rapidly giving place to products being very interesting for industry as they contain not more than two or three ethylene oxide adducts. These products are useful as raw materials for producing surfactants by sulphonation. Aluminum in the catalyst used shows all the possible coordination numbers, as demonstrated with the aid of 27AI NMR. The catalyst shows a very feeble Bronsted activity. As a consequence, small amounts of polyglycols are formed during reaction, in respect to the large amounts of ethoxylated dodecanol. Reaction rates are strongly inhibited by the presence of a Lewis base such as, for example, triphenylphosphine. The reaction seems to occur in the coordination sphere of the aluminum atoms. Other factors influencing activity and selectivity have been examined and a kinetic model has been developed on the basis of a reasonable reaction mechanism. Keywords: Ethoxylation; Fatty alcohols; Aluminium catalysts 1. Introduction A great number of patents has recently been published dealing with catalytic systems promoting narrow-range ethoxylation (NRE), i.e. ethoxylation of fatty alcohols with a narrow distribution of the molecular weights of the ethoxylated oligomers and containing a very low concentration of the residual unreacted alcohol. Products of this type have better proper- \" Corresponding author. Tel.: +39-81-5476544; fax: +39-815527771. 1381-1169/96/$15.00 Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PIIS1381-1169(96)00134-3 ties than those produced with the traditional alkaline catalyst KOH and for low ethylene oxide/substrate molar ratio, can be sulphonated without forming undesired dioxane [1]. Despite the large interest shown by the industry in these products, very few scientific papers have been published devoted to the behavior and structure of the catalysts able to promote NRE, to the possible reaction mechanisms giving narrow distributions, and to the comparison of the behavior of these catalysts with that of the most used and traditional catalyst KOH. The behavior of the traditional catalyst KOH has been studied 236 M. Di Serio et al./ Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 112 (1996) 235-251 by Santacesaria et al. [2-5] and still by Santacesaria et al. [6] it has been compared with that of an alkaline earth catalyst, that is, the first discovered NRE catalytic system (see for example Refs. [7,8]). Alkaline earth catalysts promote NRE because they affect proton transfer equilibria, as demonstrated by Santacesaria et al. [6]. Very efficient NRE catalysts are some Lewis acids (see for example Ref. [9]). In particular, two patents [10,11] have recently proposed the use of an aluminum alkoxide treated with concentrated sulfuric acid as a possible NRE catalyst of high efficiency. We studied this catalytic system for what concerns: the structure of the catalyst, its kinetic behavior and the reaction mechanism originating the narrow distribution of the oligomers. This catalyst has a peculiar kinetic behavior if compared with that of the traditional catalyst KOH. The reaction starts with a very high rate, but, after the addition of about one mole of ethylene oxide per mole of the substrate, the activity of the catalyst strongly decreases. As a consequence, fatty alcohol is quickly consumed and the distribution of the oligomer can be limited to the addition of a small number of ethylene oxide adducts. Therefore, narrow range distribution is essentially originated from the strong difference among the initiation and the propagation constants, that is ki kp. The reasons for this behavior will be examined and discussed. Finally, on the basis of the experimental observations, a reaction mechanism will be proposed and a kinetic model, able to simulate the kinetic runs performed, will be developed. 2. Experimental 2.1. Apparatus, methods and reagents 2.1.1. Preparation of the catalyst and techniques used for characterization The catalyst has been prepared by reacting, first of all, aluminum isopropoxide with 1- dodecanol in a stoichiometric amount. The following exchange reaction occurs: Al(i - Pr0)3 + 3ROH -j Al(OR)3 + 3i - PrOH (1) The reaction is performed at about 130. At this temperature the formed isopropanol is easily stripped with a nitrogen stream and collected in a cooled graduated cylinder. The aluminum tridodecanoxide formed is liquid at reaction temperature, but condenses below 50 giving a white amorphous solid. Al(i-Pr0)3 is almost completely converted as it resulted from the collected amount of isopropanol. After the exchange reaction (1) temperature was lowered at 50 and then sulfuric acid (100%) was added dropwise to the aluminum tridodecanoxide, under vigorous stirring of the solution, until reaching a prefixed molar ratio H2S04/Al between 0 and 1. The reaction occurring in this case is: Al(OR)3 + HZS04 - Al(OR)S04 + 2ROH (2) We attempted without success to remove free dodecanol by heating the reaction mixture under vacuum. This fact indicates that dodecanol is probably strongly bounded to aluminum atoms in the way shown in Scheme 1 and it may be responsible for the weak Bronsted acidity observed. This type of acidity has been evidenced according to the way suggested by Benesi [12] and corresponds to the color change of methyl yellow occurring at p Ka = 3.3. ~AI Scheme 1. M. Di Serio et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 112 (1996) 235-251 237 The addition of sulfuric acid to aluminum tridodecanoxide determines a strong increase of the viscosity of the solution. This fact suggests the occurrence of molecular condensation with an increase in the molecular weight of the aluminum complexes. The catalyst so prepared was then submitted to the IR and 27AI NMR analysis. The IR spectra were recorded in the region from 4000 to 400 cm-' by means of a Digilab FTS-40 spectrophotometer. The spectrum of aluminium tridodecanoxide was obtained on a KBr pellet of the compound, while the spectra of 1-dodecanol and aluminum tridodecanoxide treated with sulfuric acid were observed by placing a small amount of each substance between two pellets of pure KBr. To prevent hydrolysis of the aluminum compounds, the samples were prepared in a glove bag under NZ atmosphere and KBr was previously desiccated in an oven at 100. The IR spectrum of aluminium tridodecanoxide treated with sulfuric acid was recorded at 100 K in order to resolve the broad bands observed at room temperature in the frequency region of sulphate vibrations. 27AI NMR spectra were obtained on a JEOL EX400 spectrometer operating at 104.16 MHz. Chemical shifts are reported downfield positive in respect to [Al(H20)6]3+. The spectra were acquired with 90pulse of 12.5 ms, recycle delay of 0.185 s and a number of transient of 5000-10000. 2.1.2. Ethoxylation reactor, operative conditions, analysis and reagents Kinetic runs were performed in a 1.5 L jacketed stainless steel reactor equipped with a magnetically driven stirrer, consisting in a turbine connected as in Fig. 1 to a holed rod able to develop a great interfacial area. The reactor was supplied by Inox Impianti. The control of pressure, temperature and ethylene oxide feeding the reactor was fully automatized by a computer. The ethylene oxide consumption was directly measured and recorded at each instant with a weight balance connected to the computer measuring the weight loss of the ethylene A B Fig. 1.

The ethylene oxide bottle was pressurized with nitrogen at about 10 atm. Temperature and pressure were controlled and recorded at each instant. Temperature was kept constant by using two thermostated fluids, one for heating and the other for freezing the reaction mixture. The heating fluid circulated in the reactor jacket, the freezing one was fed, when necessary, in a coil inside the reactor. Ethylene oxide was automatically fed to the reactor to keep a preset pressure value constant. Kinetic runs were performed at different temperatures, pressures, catalyst concentrations and HZS04/Al molar ratio. Temperatures were changed in the range 100-150, pressure in the range 1-2 atm, catalyst concentrations in the range 0.6-1.5 o in moles of aluminum, and the molar ratio HZS04/Al from 0 to 1. Samples of the reaction mixtures were taken from the reactor at different times and chromatographically analyzed by HPLC, after derivatization with 3,5-dinitrobenzoylchloride, following the method suggested by Desberre et al. [13]. The HPLC column used was a 25 cm long Lichrospher 100 Diol with 0.4 cm diameter, supplied by Merck. The elution gradient technique was employed with a solvent A [99/ 1 (v/v) = n-eptane/CHZC12 2-propanol (95/5)] and a solvent B [ 60/40 (v/v) = n- 238 Table 1 Elution gradient program in the HPLC analysis of ethoxylated oligomers T (min.)

The solvent feed rate was 0.0166 cm3/s and the UV detector was kept at 254 nm. The response of the detector was the same for all the oligomers. In order to interpret kinetic data, the values of the densities of the reaction mixtures and solubilities of the ethylene oxide in those mixtures must be known. Densities can be calculated with the empirical relation: d = 0.86 + 2.5 - 10-2nEO - 4.76 - 10-4nEO - 2.69 - 10-5n - 7.7 - 10-4T (3) determined by regression on many experimental data by Di Serio et al. [5], nEO is the mean number of ethylene oxide adducts. Solubilities were calculated as suggested by Di Serio et al. [5] according to the Wilson equation using the following parameters: A12 = 13.00 + 0.9611 nEO - 1.967 - 10-2nEO (4a) A21 = -0.4069 + 4.714 - 10-2nEO - 1.340 - 10nEO (4b) All the reagents were supplied by Aldrich at the highest degree of purity available. Ethylene oxide was supplied by SIAD. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. IR catalyst characterization IR spectra have been recorded for comparison purposes respectively on 1-dodecanol, alu- M.

The suggested assignments are consistent with those proposed by Barraclough et al. [15] to interpret the vibrational spectra of some metal alkoxides. It is worth noting that, according to these authors, the band at about 1060 cm-' should be assigned to terminal alkoxide groups, while the one at about 1030 cm-' to bridging alkoxide groups, thus indicating an oligomeric structure of the examined compounds. This might also be the case for aluminum tridodecanoxide, even if the number of bands observed for metal-oxygen vibrations is not in contradiction with the hypothesis of a monomeric structure. In order to obtain structural information from the IR spectrum of aluminium tridodecanoxide treated with sulfuric acid, it is useful to recall how the activity and number of the vibrational modes of S04 - change when the ion is coordinated to a metal atom [16]. Nakamoto [16] reported the possible structures of the metal complexes with sulfuric acid and the corresponding IR absorption bands, see Scheme 2. The free sulphate ion belongs to the Td point group and four fundamental vibrational modes are expected: PI (A,), v2 (E), v3 (T2) and v4 (T2), among which only v3 and v4 are infrared active, giving rise to bands at about 1100 and 600 cm-'. In the unidentate coordination mode, the symmetry lowers to C3v, causing the appearance in the IR spectrum of bands corresponding to vt and v2, while the degeneracy of v3 and v4 is partially removed, each one giving rise to two bands. In the bidentate coordination ~ AI-~0. %O-AI _ ty Scheme 3, mode, both chelating and bridging, the symmetry of the sulphate becomes Czv, that leads to the complete splitting of v3 and v4 into three bands (see also Ref. [17]). Bridging and chelating sulphate groups cannot therefore be distinguished on the basis of symmetry, but it has been observed that the sulphur-oxygen stretching frequencies are higher for the latter than for the former one: for example, Barraclough et al. [151 report bands at 1195, 1110, 1030 and 960 cm-1 for Pd(NH3)2504 (bridged) and at 1240, 1125, 1040-1015 and 955 cm-' for [Pd(phen)S041 (chelated). On the basis of the above considerations, in the spectrum of our catalyst (Fig. 2a and Table 2) we assign to a bridging bidentate coordinated sulphate group, of the type shown by Scheme 2, the bands at 1192, 1127 and 1072 cm-' ( v3) and the band at 997 cm-' (vt). The bands at 696, 615 and 602 cm-1 can be tentatively assigned to the v4 mode of the same group, even if in this spectral range also bands due to Al-O stretching vibrations should be observed; finally, no band can be easily individuated between 500 and 400 cm-', where the 7.2 frequency should fall. The structure in Scheme 3 seems to be dominant and explains well the increase of the vis- o- !o Free Ion 1.11 1 : Uniderte complex , . .... . ...... ` , , : : .. Bidentate complex . .

Moreover, the bidentate structure in Scheme 3 should have Lewis superacidic properties in analogy with similar structures proposed by Hino and Arata [18] and Arata [19] for zirconium oxide treated on the surface with sulfuric acid, see Scheme 4. In a recent review Misono and Okuhara [20] considered the zirconium oxide, treated with sulfuric acid, at the top level as a solid Lewis superacid, but no information is available on sulphated aluminum. Scheme 4, in the presence of water, shows Broensted acidity, too, as evidenced by the scheme reported above. Also, our catalyst exhibits low Broensted acidity, confirmed, as previously mentioned, by the behavior of some indicators with different pKa [12]. On the basis of the IR spectrum, this acidity can be attributed to the presence of metal coordinated alcohol, demonstrated by a broad absorption band with components at 3379, 3262, 3224 and 3144 cm-', assigned to O-H stretching modes and by a band at - 1640 cm-', assigned to the O-H bending mode of coordinated dodecanol [21]. By concluding, IR spectra suggest the formation of a bidentate structure of the type shown in Scheme 5, in which the strong inductive effect of the sulphate group favors the formation of very strong Lewis acid sites and weak Bronsted ones according to Scheme 5. 3.2. 27AI-NMR catalyst characterization Spectra have been made for the original reagent aluminum isopropoxide, aluminum tri- 01 Scheme 4. Scheme 5. dodecanoxide and aluminum tridodecanoxide treated with different amounts of sulfuric acid, corresponding to the molar ratios HZS04/Al 0.25, 0.5 and 1, respectively. These spectra obtained are reported in Fig. 3. Again, before interpreting them, we briefly summarize what is known from literature about this argument. According to Akitt [22] aluminum alkoxides can assume oligomeric structures such as shown in Scheme 6. We can observe that, in these structures, aluminum can be four, five or six coordinate. Moreover, in the same structures we can have more than one type of coordination. The 27AI-NMR spectrum for the tetrameric structure of aluminum isopropoxide is reported in literature by Akitt and Duncan [23] and Poncelet et al. [24]. The spectrum shows a very sharp peak of unitary intensity centered at about 0 ppm which has been attributed to the central octahedral aluminum, as well as a broad peak of triple intensity with a maximum centered at about 60-80 ppm which corresponds to the three atoms of four-coordinate aluminum in the tetramer molecule. Kriz et al. [25] give a more exact evaluation of the chemical shifts for octahedral aluminum at 3.2 and 58.5 ppm. The same authors give 27AI-NMR spectra for 9 different aluminum alkoxides confirming narrow peaks and low chemical shifts (3-5 ppm) for six-coordinate aluminum, and broader peaks and higher chemical shifts for five-coordinate (29-44 ppm) and four-coordinate (about 35-66 ppm) aluminum. Akitt [22] reports the 27AI-NMR spectra for three different aluminum alkoxides containing, respectively, the dimeric structure of M. Di Serio et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 112 (1996) 235-251 A1(OtBu)3, the trimeric linear structure containing few tetramer of Al(Oipr)3 and a mixture of tetramers containing also a linear tetramer with five-coordinate aluminum. According to these spectra chemical shifts for hexa-coordinate aluminum is about 3-5 ppm, for the penta-coordinate 35 ppm and for the tetra 55-65 ppm. The existence of five-coordinate aluminum has been confirmed by many authors [26-28]. In particular, Benn et al. [28] have isolated the compound (C2H5)2AIOCH2CH20CH3 for which they determined by X-ray diffraction the structure shown in Scheme 7. The same compound examined by 27AI-NMR confirms the presence of five-coordinate aluminum. When the group OCH 2CH ZOCH 3 is replaced by a group OC 2 H 5, only four-coordinate aluminum turns out at the 27AI-NMR analysis. Therefore, the presence of an ethoxy ligand favors five-coordination aluminum. In conclusion, three types of coordination for the metal have been observed in aluminum alkoxides by 27AI-NMR analysis: they are sixcoordinate aluminum with chemical shifts of 0-5 ppm, five-coordinate aluminum with chemical shifts of 30-40 ppm and four-coordinate Dimer 241 aluminum with chemical shifts of 55-70 ppm. To the best of our knowledge, no information is available in literature for aluminum alkoxides sulphate obtained by 2'Al-NMR analysis. The spectrum of aluminum isopropoxide (Fig. 3a) shows two peaks: the narrower one is centered at 5.2 ppm whereas a much broader peak has a maximum at 62.5 ppm. Their relative ratio is 1:3 and the two resonances can be assigned to a six and a four-coordinate aluminum, respectively. The commercial product, therefore, seems to be a non linear tetramer similar to that depicted in Scheme 6. In the spectrum of aluminum tridodecanoxide (Fig. 3b) the narrow peak at 5.2 ppm has completely disappeared, while a very broad peak centered at 63 ppm and a shoulder at about 40 ppm appear. Then, we suggest that the bulky dodecanoxide groups produce the prevalence of linear tetrameric forms with a smaller amount of pentacoordination at aluminum atoms. The addition of sulfuric acid produces a small shift of the main broad peak from 63 to 59 and the appearance of a narrower resonance at about 3 ppm (Fig. 3c, d, e). The intensity of this peak increases with the amount of sulfuric acid and OB O. 'mers RO'~ R \\ .... i.. R .. . ~ 1 R. OR Scheme 6. 242 M. Di Serio et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 112 (1996) 235-251 in the meantime the relative intensity of the broad resonance centered at 59 ppm decreases. When the H2S04/Al ratio becomes 1 (Fig. 3e), two narrow peaks appear at 1.3 and -4.4 ppm, respectively. It is reasonable to conclude that sulfuric acid strongly favors the formation of the six-coordinate aluminum atoms in respect to four-coordinate ones. However, we cannot exclude the presence of five-coordinated aluminum, too. The presence of two narrow peaks at low chemical shifts can be interpreted as the existence of two types of six-coordinate aluminum different because of their near environment. By concluding, the exchange of isopropoxide with dodecanoxide groups produces local disorder, as expected. The introduction of sulfuric acid, on the contrary, increases aluminum coordination and restores local symmetry around the aluminum atom. The increase in aluminum coordination seems to be related to the catalytic activity, but we cannot completely rule out the role of the pentacoordination in the catalytic process. 3.3. Kinetic runs and relations between activity and catalyst acidity Preliminary runs have been performed in order to define the best catalyst. For comparison purposes Fig. 4 reports the kinetic behaviors of KOH, aluminum dodecanoxide and sulphated aluminum dodecanoxide with a molar ratio sulfuric acid/aluminum equal to 1. As it can be seen, the presence of sulfuric acid strongly increases the activity of the catalyst. The initial activity of the aluminum sulphated catalyst is higher than that of the classic catalyst KOH. However, this activity quickly decreases. As a consequence, the oligomers distribution is narrower as it can be appreciated in Fig. 5. Runs performed with catalysts containing different amounts of sulfuric acids show that initial activities are roughly proportional to the amount of sulfuric acid introduced, as can be seen in Fig. 6. The addition of the Lewis' base triphenylphosphine to the catalyst strongly depresses said activity, as can be seen in Fig. 7. In this : Al Scheme 7. M.

From experimental evidence, we can conclude that the catalyst acts through the Lewis' acidity and sulfuric acid strongly enhances this type of acidity. Then, kinetic runs have been performed by changing temperature, pressure and catalyst concentration. Table 3 summarizes all the kinetic runs performed. Together with dodecanol ethoxylated oligomers, small amounts of polyglycols are formed in the reaction. It is interesting to observe that the formation of polyglycols for a molar ratio of reacted ethylene oxide/substrate lower than 1 is negligible, then polyglycols are formed with a distribution being similar, as to the number of adducts, to that of ethoxylated dodecanol oligomers. This fact suggests that polyglycols are formed by decomposition of the ethoxylated chains. Polyglycols chains can then grow independently by reacting with ethylene oxide. The formation of polyglycols should occur through the forma- 244 35 30 25 20 15 10 0 M.

These observations are in agree ment with the suggested mechanism according to which the formation of polyglycols occurs via chain decomposition. However, the amounts of polyglycols formed in the seven runs of Table 4 are relatively small. Therefore, this reaction has been neglected in the successive ethoxylation kinetic analysis. The effect of temperature on the catalyst activity can be appreciated in Fig. 8, the effect of pressure in Fig. 9 and the effect of the catalyst concentration in Fig. 10. As to oligomers distribution, it is interesting to observe that it is not affected from temperature, pressure and cat- Table 4 Amounts of polyglycols formed during the time in the kinetic runs 2 of Table 3 Run Time (min) 2 3 4 5 6 7 24 36 76 106 84 140 70 27 124 49 127 92 EO/S 1.35 1.67 1.94 2.48 1.83 1.39 1.36 0.86 1.43 0.76 1.05 2.03 Total glycols (mol%) 1.9 2.9 3.9 6.7 1.8 1.3 2.9 0.8 4.5 1.5 3.8 2.5 245 3.5 ah 2.5 h 2 - 0.5 t 150 120 0 0 20 40 60 80 100 120140 Time (minutes) Fig. 8.

Di Serio et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 112 (1996) 235-251 electron vacancy, then coordinated ethylene oxide reacts with an alkoxide bounded with aluminum. The chain can grow further (reaction (a)) or exchange the proton with a free hydroxyl group (reaction (b)). While the first equilibrium expressing the competition of ethylene oxide with alcohol is completely shifted to the right, the second one between two ethereal oxygens of ethylene oxide or ethylene oxide adduct, respectively, is probably almost equivalent in the two directions. However, as the slow steps are successive to these mentioned equilibria, the effective kinetic constants are affected by the corresponding equilibrium constants. Therefore, we can write a simplified reaction scheme as shown in Scheme 9. Then, the proton transfer reactions must be considered, too, see Scheme 10. Proton transfer equilibrium constants, as a first approximation, must be considered independent from the chain length. The reactivity for, respectively, the initiation and any propagation step becomes, therefore: r; = k; (E 1 1 = kKei [RO-AI] [EO] = k;[RO-A1J [EO] rp = kp (EN J = kp K,P [RO(EO),-Al] [EO] = kp[RO(EO)AlJ [EO] that is, the propagation constant has been considered independent from the chain length. This assumption seems to be justified by the observation of the existence of only two kinetic regimes, one dominated by the initiation rate and the other dominated by the propagation rate. This means that the inhibitory effect of the ethoxyl- (5) (6) ated chains starts at once after the formation of the first adduct. Equilibria of the type: RO(EO) n-Al + RO(EO) mH p RO(EO)m-Al + RO(EO)nH (7) can be neglected because they can be considered as linear combinations of the reaction in Scheme 10. The previous reaction scheme can be simplified indicating with Al,, the aluminum coordinated with ethoxylated dodecanol containing n ethylene oxide units. Therefore: k; Alo + EO -4 All k P All + EO -~ A12 (g) (9) kp Aln+EO-jAln+l n=1,2,3,... (10) AI, + ROH p AIO + RO(EO)nH n=1,2,3,...

The proton transfer equilibrium can be written as: Ke = [RO(EO)] [Alo] /[ROH] [Aln] n=0, 1, 2, 3,... and the aluminum mass balance will be: [Al]TOT - [Alo] + [Alt] + ... = Y [Al;] i (17) From this relation, it is possible to evaluate [Alo] reminding that: [ Al] TOT = [Alo] X j l + 1: [RO(EO);H] /(Ke [ROH]) } (16) hence: [Alo] _ (18) [ Al] TOT /C1 + E [RO(EO);H]/(Ke[ROH])} 1 (19) 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10- 0 , 0 \" 249 By introducing [Alo] in Eq. (16) it is possible to find all the [AlJ values that must be used to solve the differential Eqs. (12)-(14) to determine the evolution with the time of the oligomers distribution.

Activation energies are quite similar. The proton transfer equilibrium constant resulted 1.3 X 10-2 independently from temperature. This fact, together with the small difference in activation energies for respectively the initiation and the propagation is responsible for the invariance of the oligomer distributions with the operative conditions observed in Fig. 13. The low value for the proton transfer equilibrium constant confirms that aluminum complexes containing ethoxylated chains are more stable than the ones formed with dodecanol, as a consequence of the ethereal groups interaction with the electronic vacancy of the aluminum atoms. The fitting obtained with the described kinetic model and with the kinetic parameters previously reported can be appreciated in Fig. 11 for what concerns the evolution of the oligomers distribution with the EO/S ratio and in Fig. 13, reported as an example, for the evolution of the oligomer distribution during the time for the run 2 of Table 3. 4. Conclusions Reacting sulfuric acid with aluminum tridodecanoxide gives place to catalysts that are characterized by a very strong Lewis acidity and are completely soluble in hydrophobic solvents such as dodecanol. The ethoxylation of dodecanol is strongly promoted by this kind of catalysts, especially for the reaction with the first adduct. The addition of two or more ethylene oxide groups occurs much slowly. A narrow range distribution of the oligomers is, therefore, obtained as a consequence of this particular behavior of the catalyst. The reason of this behavior is that initially ethylene oxide easily shift dodecanol coordinated to aluminum and reacts with a dodecanoxide group bounded to aluminum. When ethoxylated dodecanol accumulates in the reaction mixture, competition occurs between ethylene oxide molecules and the ethereal oxygen of the ethoxylated chains for the interaction with the aluminum electronic vacancy. The effect is a drastic change in the kinetic regime and the obtainment of a narrow distribution. The active sites seem to be hexa-coordinated aluminum, however the possibility of the intervention of the penta-coordinated one cannot be excluded. 5.

When these alkoxides are treated with pure sulfuric acid (100% by weight) in a stoichiometric ratio, the catalytic activity is strongly increased initially but it decreases rapidly giving place to products being very interesting for industry as they contain not more than two or three ethylene oxide adducts. These products are useful as raw materials for producing surfactants by sulphonation. Aluminum in the catalyst used shows all the possible coordination numbers, as demonstrated with the aid of 27Al NMR. The catalyst shows a very feeble Bronsted activity. As a consequence, small amounts of polyglycols are formed during reaction, in respect to the large amounts of ethoxylated dodecanol. Reaction rates are strongly inhibited by the presence of a Lewis base such as, for example, triphenylphosphine. The reaction seems to occur in the coordination sphere of the aluminum atoms. Other factors influencing activity and selectivity have been examined and a kinetic model has been developed on the basis of a reasonable reaction mechanism.
