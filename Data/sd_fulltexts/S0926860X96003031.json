Macias Prrez, C. Salinas Martlnez de Lecea, A. Linares Solano * Departamento de QMmica lnorgdnica, Universidad de Alicante, Spain Received 28 June 1996; revised 29 July 1996; accepted 7 August 1996 Abstract The use of activated carbon cloth (ACC) as platinum catalyst support has been investigated using four commercial ACC samples. These ACCs have large apparent surface areas and they are essentially microporous. Platinum catalysts, prepared by impregnation, have been characterized by hydrogen chemisorption. Three different reduction treatments have been conducted, the effect of temperature and time of reduction have been analyzed. The results show good dispersion values and present two singular advantages over published data on granular activated carbon supports: (i) they have a remarkable ease of reduction; the reduction of Pt is almost complete at 393 K and (ii) they have proved to be stable at temperatures as high as 623 K and after long reduction time (12 h). Therefore, the great advantage of these catalysts, in addition to the particular shape of the cloth support, is the possibility of being used in a wide range of process temperatures. The behaviour of these Pt/ACC catalysts in a low temperature hydrogenation reaction has been tested studying their catalytic activity for nitrobenzene hydrogenation. The catalysts have been reduced, prior to the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene, at a quite low temperature (323 K) and their Pt dispersion has also been measured. Most of Pt/ACC catalysts show noticeable catalytic activity for nitrobenzene hydrogenation, carried out at 273 K. The surface area of the ACC supports controls the Pt dispersion, which in turn is responsible for the catalytic activity. A good linear relationship between activity and Pt dispersion (determined at the reduction temperature used during the hydrogenation reaction) has been found. Under the experimental conditions used the hydrogena- tion of nitrobenzene seems to be a structure insensitive reaction.

Introduction The use of carbons as catalyst supports is well established and its potential growth is being exploited [1]. Many laboratory studies have been carried out using a great variety of carbons and metals catalysts [2-5]. Activated carbon is the essential support material used by the industry, supporting platinum and palladium [6-8]. Recently, new forms of activated carbon, such as activated carbon fibers (ACF) and activated carbon cloths (ACC) are being prepared [9,10]. Their porous structure and apparent surface area depend on the nature of the raw material, the thermal treatment and the activation procedure used [9,11,12]. The apparent surface area of these active carbons is usually high, normally in the range 600-3000 m2/g. Their porous network is mainly formed by deep pores in a narrow range of sizes, especially micropores [13]. These new forms of activated carbon materials (ACC and ACF) present noticeable advantageous characteristics in relation to usual activated carbons [11]: (a) due to their shape they can be easily used, bent and rolled; (b) they have a large specific surface area and fast adsorption/desorption rate [10,14]; (c) the spaces between the fibers allow the gas, or the solution, to pass through a bundle of fibers more easily than through a granulated carbon bed, providing a more effective contact of the sorbate, a faster rate of equilibration [9], and a high fluid permeability [15]; and (d) they have much more rapid dynamic adsorption characteristics (mass transfer rates) and a lower resistance to the transmission of liquid and gases [16]. As a consequence of these particular characteristics, new applications for ACF and ACC are being studied: 1. adsorption of gases and vapors [9,11,17-19]; 2. retention of pollutants (organophosphorous compounds [20]), bacteria [21,22] or metal ions (mercury(lI) [15,23], chromium(Ill) [16]) retention; 3. electrodes manufacture [15]; and 4. catalyst supports [24-27]. Despite the great amount of research carried out on the topic of carbon materials as catalyst supports and the very voluminous literature published, of which the reviews [2-4,28] are an example, very little works deal with the use of these two new forms of activated carbons (ACC and ACF) as catalyst supports [24-27,29-32]. Because it is well established that the performance of an activated carbon support is very much dependent on its nature, and hence on its physical and chemical surface properties, much work is needed to explore the potential use of ACC as catalyst support. The present paper deals with the behaviour of four commercial ACC support- ing platinum catalysts. The variables analyzed in the paper are: (l) the influence of the support properties (porosity, surface area, surface chemistry) on the M.C. Maclas Pez et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 461-475 463 platinum dispersion, (2) the effect of temperature and time of reduction in a hydrogen atmosphere on platinum dispersion, and (3) the catalyst performance, testing the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene at 273 K after reducing the Pt samples at 323 K. 2. Experimental 2.1. Supports Four commercial available activated carbon cloths have been used; two samples, prepared by carbonization and activation of viscose rayon cloth, supplied by Charcoal Cloth, named C1 and C2, and two samples, prepared by carbonization and activation of phenolic pitch fibers (Kynol) [10], supplied by Gunei named G1 and G2. The characterization of the porous texture of the ACC was carried out by N2 and CO2 adsorption at 77 K and 273 K, respectively, in a conventional gravimetric apparatus. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) was used for the characterization of the surface oxygen groups. The decomposition products (CO2 and CO) resulting from a linear heating rate are measured by a quadrupole mass spectrometer following the experimental procedure described elsewhere [33]. 2.2. Catalyst The catalysts have been prepared by impregnation using the following experimental conditions: a piece of approximately 1 g of ACC is introduced during 24 h, at room temperature, with three different solutions of hexachloro- platinic acid to load 0.5, 1 and 3 Pt wt.-%, maintaining a constant solid-solution ratio of 4 g/1. The water is evaporated in a vacuum oven at 333 K. The catalysts are designated by the support used and the approximate quantity of metal. The total amount of Pt in the catalysts is determined by UV-VIS spectrophotometry (at A = 261.8 nm) after burning the carbon and dissolving the residue with aqua regia to form hexachloroplatinic acid. Platinum dispersion is determined by hydrogen chemisorption in a volumetric apparatus. Before measuring hydrogen chemisorption, the platinum precursor is converted to the metal by a reduction treatment. Three different treatments were carried out: 1. 1 h in H2 flow (50 ml/min) at 393 K, 2. 1 h in H2 flow (50 ml/min) at 623 K, 3. 12 h in H2 flow (50 ml/min) at 623 K. When the treatment was finished, the sample was outgassed (during 1 h) in vacuum (10-6 Torr) at 50 K below the reduction temperature, except in 464 M.C. Macfas P~rez et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 461-475 treatment A, where the temperature is maintained at the same value. Subse- quently, the sample was cooled to 303 K and the isotherm was measured in the range 50-250 Torr where the isotherm is linear. The monolayer coverage on platinum was determined using the procedure of Benson and Boudart [34] extrapolating the linear isotherms to the zero-pressure intercept. Pt dispersion has also been determined after reducing the sample at 323 K (1 h) because this reduction treatment was also used before measuring catalytic activity for ni- trobenzene hydrogenation. 2.3. Nitrobenzene hydrogenation reaction Nitrobenzene hydrogenation was carried out in a 100-ml three-necked vessel at 273 K and at atmospheric pressure. The experimental procedure is as follows: 0.1 g of catalyst is located in the vessel and it is reduced at 323 K for 1 h under a H2 flow (50 cm3/min). After cooling to reaction temperature (273 K), a mixture of ethanol (25 ml) and nitrobenzene (4.84 mmol) is injected through one arm of the flask with the use of a syringe. The reaction mixture is stirred and at different reaction times a portion (1 ml) of the reaction liquid is withdrawn with a syringe, for chemical analysis. The chemical analysis of the products is performed by FID (flame ionization detector) gas chromatography (Hewlett Packard 5790A). Product separation is carried out on a stainless steel column filled with 10% SP2100 on 100/120 mesh Supelcoport. The compounds analyzed from the reaction mixture with their corresponding retention times (function of our operation variables) are ethanol (0.83 min), nitrosobenzene (1.49 min), aniline (1.70 min) and nitrobenzene (2.25 min). Blank tests with unsupported ACC have been carried out to check nitrobenzene adsorption at 273 K in order to confirm the negative mass balance observed during the hydrogena- tion of nitrobenzene, as will be discussed later on. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Characterization of the supports 3.1.1. Textural characterization One of the objectives of the present study is to analyze the possible effect of the surface properties of the support on the catalyst dispersion. For this purpose, nitrogen and carbon dioxide adsorption isotherms were determined at 77 and 273 K, respectively. N2 adsorption isotherms are of type I of the BDDT classification [35], except for sample C2 where a significant slope from P/Po = 0.2 is observed as is shown in Fig. 1. The Figure presents the nitrogen adsorption isotherms of two samples, the most microporous one, belonging to the G series and the most mesoporous one, belonging to the C series. Important M.C.

(Q) sample G2; (0) sample C2. 465 differences in adsorption capacity are observed among the four ACC samples, the Kynol activated carbon cloths presenting the largest N2 adsorption values. CO2 adsorption isotherms confirm that samples of the C series have lower micropore volume than samples of G series. The apparent surface area was obtained from N2 adsorption data using the BET equation [35]. The micropore volume (VMIcRo) was obtained from CO2 isotherms using the Dubinin-Radushkevich equation [35]. The supermicropore volume (Vsp) was estimated subtracting VMICRo from the pore volume obtained applying the Dubinin-Radushkevich equation to the N2 isotherm. Finally, the mesopore volume (VMs) was calculated from the nitrogen isotherm by subtrac- tion of the adsorbed gas volume (expressed as liquid) at relative pressure of 0.2 from that at 0.95. The results are summarized in Table 1. The samples have high apparent surface areas, near 1000 m2/g for series C and 1500 m2/g for series G.

Sample C2 presents the widest pore size distribution, and sample G1 the narrowest one. Consequently, these ACC that exhibit different textural characteristics, can be useful to analyze their behaviour as catalyst supports. 3.1.2. Surface oxygen groups Surface chemistry, and the surface oxygen groups in particular, may affect dispersion of catalysts supported on carbon in a complex way [36-39]. The amount of CO and CO2 desorbed by the sample in TPD experiments can be related with the amount of the oxygen surface groups of the carbon. CO2 is evolved from acid groups (carboxylic and anhydride groups), meanwhile CO proceeds from weakly acid, neutral and basic groups (phenolic, carbonyl, quinones and pyrones) [40]. Table 2 shows the amounts of CO and CO2 evolved by the ACC under study. It can be observed that the amount of CO is approximately the same for all the samples (except G2), but the amount of evolved CO2 depends on the nature of the support. The C series evolve nearly twice as much of CO2 than the G series. Presumably their different industrial methods of preparation are responsible for this difference. 3.2. Characterization of Pt dispersion Different reduction treatments (temperature and time) have been carried out to assess the changes on the dispersion of Pt, in order to investigate the behaviour of the ACC supports. The ease or difficulty of the reduction of Pt and its sintering are two important characteristics of a catalyst, related to its interaction with the support. Table 3 includes the dispersion values for samples with percentages of Pt near to 1% and the dispersion values obtained with the G1 support with different wt% of Pt loadings. Dispersion values have shown to vary in a range between 0.18 and 0.58. Literature, dealing with granular activated carbons as platinum catalyst supports, shows that a wide range of metal dispersion, determined by hydrogen chemisorption can be obtained [36,41-44]. Dispersion values depend on a series of interconnected factors such as: method of preparation, type of M.C. Macfas P~rez et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 461-475 Table 3 Catalysts dispersion for impregnated samples 467 Catalyst % Pt Dispersion Aa B C CI-1 1.1 0.35 0.45 0.46 C2-1 1.3 0.18 0.29 0.31 G1-0.5 0.6 0.64 - - G 1-1 1.2 0.47 0.58 0.57 GI-3 3.1 0.57 - - G2-1 1.1 0.44 0.44 0.44 A, B, C are different reduction treatments. support, precursor used as well as on the pretreatments of the catalysts used to obtain the metal in its elementary state. The results of Table 3 allow us to state that ACC are appropriate supports for platinum catalysts because dispersion values are generally high, especially for the sample GI-1, independently of the Pt wt.-% loading studied (0.5, 1 and 3). It is well established that the reduction temperature is an important parameter that affects the catalyst dispersion and activity. Thus, Uhlir et al. [45] studied the effect of reduction temperature using a Pt/carbon catalyst, in the range of 343-573 K. They found a higher hydrogenation activity for the catalyst reduced at lower temperatures. Machek et al. [46], studying a similar system, found an important effect of sintering using 573 K instead of 373 K as reduction temperature. From these two examples, and from many others, it is known that in general the temperature at which the catalyst is prepared has a considerable effect on the dispersion of platinum. The higher the reduction temperature is, the lower its dispersion will be, because an important sintering process of the platinum generally occurs [47]. Although the effect of the reduction temperature has been extensively analyzed on many carbon supports no results have been published in ACC. The comparison of the results obtained after different reduction treatments indicates that, in general, these supports lead to catalysts that are easily reduced and hence a high-temperature treatment and a long reduction time is not necessary to reduce the platinum. Considering that hydrogen is only chemisorbed over Pt[34], dispersion values (Table 3) show that the mildest treatment (1 h, 393 K) produces a high percentage of reduced metal (worked out by the relation dispersion (A)/dispersion (C) 100). The highest percentage of reduced metal is for the sample G2-1 (100%), which shows the same dispersion values for all treatments. This interesting observation, unusual in other carbonaceous supports (GAC or carbon black), can be related with the recent work of Fu and co-workers [30,31] who have shown by using X-ray diffraction, titration tech- nique and XPS, that an ACF is able to reduce PtTM in solution to Pt In our case, the platinum precursor is, presumably, partly reduced during impregnation. 468 M.C.

Platinum dispersion versus support mesopore volume (after treatment: ( A, ( B and ( C. It is also interesting to point out from the results of Table 3 that at higher temperature (623 K in treatments B and C) the catalysts are stable and sintering does not occur. These results indicate that ACC are appropriate carbon supports for platinum; they allow to use Pt-ACC catalysts in processes where a reaction is carded out at high temperature because they stand more severe treatments without decreasing dispersion, but it is possible to use them in low temperature reactions as well. As example of such a low temperature reaction will be shown next with the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene in which the Pt samples have been reduced only at 323 K. From Table 3 results, the influence of the textural properties of the supports used can be inferred. Comparing the results for both series of ACC supports, it is clear that dispersion values are higher for the more microporous G series than for the C series (the difference between C2-1 and GI-1 is about 50%). Furthermore, the sample showing the smallest dispersion is that whose support contains the highest mesopore volume (C2-1). A plot of catalyst dispersion, after the three reduction temperatures studied, versus mesopore volume of the differ- ent supports is presented in Fig. 2. A similar behaviour is observed for the different pretreatments used. The catalyst dispersion decreases as the mesopore volume of the support increases, suggesting a preferential formation of large Pt particles in the large pores. These results are different from those obtained with granular activated carbons, where a dependence of platinum dispersion with the volume of pores with diameter in the range 9-11 nm has been found [41]. The role of oxygen surface groups of the carbon support in defining the properties of the platinum catalyst has been studied previously [36,39,47]. In carbons with similar surface areas, dispersion increases with the amount of surface oxygen groups [47]. Ehrburger [48] suggested that the rate of sintering M.C. Maclas Pgrez et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 461-475 469 may be affected by surface groups. So, the supported clusters are trapped on surface heterogeneities; these active sites restrict particle mobility decreasing their sintering. In our case it is observed, relating total surface oxygen groups (Ixmol CO2/g plus txmol CO/g) (Table 2) and dispersion (Table 3), that there is no clear relationship. However, a relationship between the ease of reduction (deduced from dispersion values at different reduction temperatures) and the amount of surface groups seems to exist between the two series of ACC used. C samples have higher total amount of oxygen surface groups than G samples and if dispersion values in the three treatments (A, B, C) are compared, G samples reach a constant value with the mildest treatment, whereas in C samples the dispersion increases with the reduction temperature. Thus, the higher the amount of oxygen groups (C series) the more difficult the reduction seems to be. This reasonable observation, which might not be extrapolated to other carbon sup- ports, denotes the importance that the Pt-carbon interaction has on its reduction and subsequent catalytic activity. The reason for the ease of the Pt reduction, observed in this study, in comparison with the other carbonaceous supports and its relation with the quantity of oxygen functional groups are not well under- stood. Further investigations, focused on the Pt-carbon interactions, are neces- sary. 3.3. Catalytic activity In the case of noble metal catalysts supported on carbon, the reactions more frequently used are liquid phase reactions, with three different phases, solid (catalys0, liquid (some reagents, products and solvent) and gas (the reagent hydrogen) [49]. Among industrial hydrogenation reactions, the reduction of nitro groups in nitroaromatic compounds is very important, due to the possibility to obtain compounds such as aniline and others [50]. This reaction which is easy to carry out following the changes in products and reactant has been used as a catalytic test to analyze the activity of platinum catalysts. The low temperature reduction used to reduce the Pt, prior to the hydrogenation reaction (323 K), is especially relevant to confirm the ease of reduction of Pt in these ACC supports as observed above. Hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline has been studied and distribution of reactants and products has been analyzed at different reaction times. The reaction of nitrobenzene to aniline proceeds through a reaction intermediate, phenylhydroxylamine which will decompose to nitrosobenzene and aniline during gas chromatographic analysis [51]. Using calibration curves for nitroben- zene, aniline and nitrosobenzene, and considering the decomposition reaction of phenylhydroxylamine, it is possible to work out reactant and products concentra- tion. Fig. 3 shows an example of the distribution of the reactant and products versus time for sample G2-1 including the mass balance. Nitrobenzene decreases 470 M.C.

(( nitrobenzene, ( aniline, (0) phenylhydroxyl- amine, and (*) mass balance). with time while aniline increases, phenylhydroxylamine concentration exhibits a maximum corresponding to the disappearance of nitrobenzene as corresponds to a reaction intermediate. Mass balance is shown in the graphic as well. In all the catalysts a negative balance is obtained, at least during the first 200 min of reaction, but the initial value is slowly regained. This observation points out that an important adsorption of reactants or products on the catalyst (support or metal) exists. This observation was expected because it is well known that active carbons are good adsorbents for nitroaromatic compounds [52]. Adsorption seems to be more important in the case of the reactant than for the products, because the balance increases at the same time as nitrobenzene decreases. Blank tests, using the supports (without Pt precursor), confirm the nitrobenzene uptake and, as it will be discussed next, its dependence with the surface area of the supports. Fig. 4 presents the evolution of nitrobenzene concentrations (expressed as mol of nitrobenzene/g of catalyst) versus the reaction time. From these representations the rate of nitrobenzene hydrogenation can be assessed. Thus, the specific catalytic activity of the different catalysts (mmol of nitrobenzene consumed per gram catalyst and minute) has been calculated, from the slope of the linear part of the nitrobenzene curve. It should be pointed out that the data fit well the line and that each line intercepts the y-axis at a given value. The higher the surface area of the ACC, the larger is the separation between the interception M.C.

This separation is related to the adsorption of nitrobenzene by the ACC and therefore is related to the surface area of the ACC. Fig. 4 shows that the rate of nitrobenzene reduction for the G series catalysts are higher than the C series. At first glance, Fig. 4 could allow us to point out that the rate for nitroben- zene hydrogenation is controlled by the surface area of the ACC supports. 0.5 mmol/min gcat 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 I 0 0.1 0.2 d Fig. 5.

Macias P~rez et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 461-475 However, a closer look to the Pt dispersion of the catalysts, determined after their reduction at the same temperature than the one used prior to the nitroben- zene hydrogenation, clearly shows that the surface area of the ACC supports is not the key factor. Fig. 5 presents the correlation observed between catalytic activity for nitrobenzene reduction versus the Pt dispersion. The good relation- ship observed between these two values indicates that the catalytic activity is controlled by the Pt dispersion, that is by the number of reduced Pt surface atoms available for the reaction. Under the experimental conditions used (and up to a Pt dispersion degree of 0.2), the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene is a structure insensitive reaction. This observation agrees with the results of Blakely et al. [53] who reported that the reaction of nitrobenzene hydrogenation in the gas phase takes place on one Pt surface atom. In fact, the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene in the gas phase has been used by other authors as an indirect measure of metal dispersion [54]. Interestingly, the most microporous ACC series (G) have higher Pt disper- sions because the surface of the ACC controls the Pt dispersion which in turn controls the catalytic activity. This relationship between surface area and dispersion is not so usual when Pt is supported on GAC [54]. The distribution profiles of the reactant and products versus time of the different samples studied (curves similar to that of Fig. 3) show that nitroben- zene is hydrogenated to phenylhydroxylamine and then this intermediate is hydrogenated to aniline with different reaction rates depending on the sample analyzed. In general, up to 50% of the nitrobenzene conversion the main reaction product is phenylhydroxylamine. As the percentage of nitrobenzene conversion increases, the aniline increases.

Conclusions The investigation of the platinum dispersion and catalytic activity for ni- trobenzene hydrogenation of platinum catalysts supported on four commercial activated carbon cloths allows the following conclusions to be drawn. ACC with different physical and chemical surface properties are appropriate supports for platinum catalysts leading to high dispersion values. The compari- son of the results obtained after different reduction treatments indicates that these supports make catalysts that are easily reduced and also stand high temperatures without an appreciable sintering process. These characteristics allow to use Pt/ACC catalysts in processes at low and high reaction tempera- tures. Textural properties of the ACC affect catalyst properties. The catalyst disper- sion decreases as the mesopore volume of the support increases, suggesting a preferential formation of large Pt particles in the large pores. Chemical proper- ties of the ACC surface also affect catalyst properties. A large amount of oxygen surface groups make the reduction of the platinum precursor more difficult. Pt/ACC are good catalysts for nitrobenzene hydrogenation even after mild reduction at 323 K. The surface area of the ACC supports controls the Pt dispersion (responsible for the catalytic activity). A linear relationship between activity and Pt dispersion (both determined at the same reduction temperature) has been found. The hydrogenation of nitrobenzene (under the experimental conditions used) seems to be a structure insensitive reaction.

Salinas Martínez de Lecea A. Linares Solano ∗ Departamento de Química Inorgánica, Universidad de Alicante, Spain ∗ Corresponding author. The use of activated carbon cloth (ACC) as platinum catalyst support has been investigated using four commercial ACC samples. These ACCs have large apparent surface areas and they are essentially microporous. Platinum catalysts, prepared by impregnation, have been characterized by hydrogen chemisorption. Three different reduction treatments have been conducted, the effect of temperature and time of reduction have been analyzed. The results show good dispersion values and present two singular advantages over published data on granular activated carbon supports: (i) they have a remarkable ease of reduction; the reduction of Pt is almost complete at 393 K and (ii) they have proved to be stable at temperatures as high as 623 K and after long reduction time (12 h). Therefore, the great advantage of these catalysts, in addition to the particular shape of the cloth support, is the possibility of being used in a wide range of process temperatures. The behaviour of these Pt ACC catalysts in a low temperature hydrogenation reaction has been tested studying their catalytic activity for nitrobenzene hydrogenation. The catalysts have been reduced, prior to the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene, at a quite low temperature (323 K) and their Pt dispersion has also been measured. Most of Pt ACC catalysts show noticeable catalytic activity for nitrobenzene hydrogenation, carried out at 273 K. The surface area of the ACC supports controls the Pt dispersion, which in turn is responsible for the catalytic activity. A good linear relationship between activity and Pt dispersion (determined at the reduction temperature used during the hydrogenation reaction) has been found. Under the experimental conditions used the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene seems to be a structure insensitive reaction.
