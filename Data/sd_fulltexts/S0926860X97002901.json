Catalytic synthesis of dimethyl ether from synthesis gas was evaluated in a fixed-bed flow microreactor at a pressure of 4.0 MPa and a GHSVof 1500 h 1. Characterization of catalysts has been carried out using XRD, TPR, Pyridine-TPD, CO2-TPD and XPS. The experimental results show that CuO-ZnO-AlzO3/HZSM-5 and CuO-ZnO- A1203/HSY catalysts, which were prepared by a coprecipitating sedimentation method, exhibit the highest catalytic activity for direct synthesis of dimethyl ether from synthesis gas with 89% CO conversion and 99% selectivity of dimethyl ether (in organic products). In addition, the results indicate that the dehydration step of the reaction occurs on the weak acidic sites and there is a 'synergistic effect' between the two kinds of active components in bifunctional catalysts. ~;~ 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction Dimethyl ether (DME) is a useful chemical inter- mediate for the preparation of many important che- micals, including dimethyl sulfate, methyl acetate and lower olefins [1-7]. More recently it has been increas- ingly used as an aerosol propellant to replace chloro- fluoro carbons, which were found to destroy the ozone layer of the atmosphere [8-10]. In addition, it may be used directly as a transportation fuel in admixture with methanol or as a fuel additive [11-14]. At present, DME has been produced from synthesis gas, most of which comes from coal, petroleum and natural gas. There are two ways for the preparation of *Correspunding author. DME from synthesis gas: a two-step method including the methanol formation and its dehydration and a one- step method, that is, direct synthesis of DME from synthesis gas. Compared to the two-step method, the one-step method is attracting more industrial attention for its dramatic economic values and theoretical sig- nificance. Bifunctional catalysts for conversion of syngas to DME have two kinds of active sites: one is for methanol formation and the other for methanol dehy- dration. The contact separation of the two kinds of active sites affects catalytic properties of bifunctional catalysts. In the present work, the effects of prepara- tion methods and dehydration components on cata- lytic properties and the structures of bifunctional catalysts were investigated. Characterization of the catalysts has been carried out using X-ray diffraction 0926-860X/98/$19.00 ;~ 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. Pll S0926-860X(97)00290- 1 24 Q.

Experimental 2.1. Pretreatment of dehydration components of catalysts Pretreatment of molecular sieves: Commercial pro- ducts such as NaZSM-5, NaSY, NaX, NaZM760, NaA were exchanged into H-form by ion exchange, then calcined in N2 for 4 h. Preparation of SO2 -Zr02 super-acid: Zr(OH)4 was impregnated with 1 N sulphuric acid and calcined at 600 [15]. Preparation of Si02-Al203 and Si02: Silicic acid and aluminium hydrate were mixed in a proportional ratio and then dried, calcined, and ground to powder. Thus, SIO2-A1203 was formed. However, only silicic acid was dried and then calcined to SiO2. 2.2. Preparation of bifunctional catalysts I. Coprecipitation method: A solution of Cu(NO3)2.3H20, Zn(NO3)2.6H20 and Al(NO3)3- 9H:O and a solution of Na2CO3 were coprecipitated when added to H20 simultaneously and dropwise over a period of 30 min at 70, pH=7 under continuous stirring. The precipitates formed were further aged for an hour under stirring at the same temperature. The precipitates were then filtered out, washed and dried at 120 for 4 h, then calcined in N2 at 350 for 6 h. At last, the resultant powder was moulded under pressure into tablets which were then crushed into granules and sieved to 20,~40 meshes. II. Slur~ mixing method: A solution of Cu(NO3)2.3H20, Zn(NO3)2.6H20 and a solution of Al(NO3)3.9H20 were coprecipitated separately with a solution of NazCO3 when added to H20 simultaneously and dropwise over a period of 30 min at 70 under continuous stirring. Both the precipitates formed were aged for an additional hour under stirring at the same temperature. Then both precipitates were filtered, washed and mixed with each other when added to H20. Mixed precipitates were continuously stirred for 30 rain and then filtered, dried and calcined. The following procedure is the same as in method I. IlL Impregnation method: The CuO/ZnO/Al203 catalysts were prepared by impregnation of \"y-AI203 with a comparable volume of copper and zinc nitrate solution. The soaked paste was dried at 12@C, ground and fired in N2 at 350 for 6 h. The following procedure is the same as in method I. IV. Coprecipitating impregnation method: Copper, zinc and aluminium nitrate solution and sodium car- bonate solution were coprecipitated when added to ~'-A1203 and H20 suspended liquid simultaneously and dropwise. The following procedure is the same as in method I. V. Coprecipitating sedimentation method: Copper, zinc and aluminium nitrate solution and sodium carbonate solution were coprecipitated when added to H20 simultaneously and dropwise over a period of 30 rain at 70, pH=7 under continuous stirring. The precipitates which formed were aged for an additional hour under stirring at the same temperature. The precipitates were then filtered, washed and added to the suspended liquid including dehydration component and water. The mixtures were stirred, filtered, dried, and calcined. The resultant powder was moulded under pressure into tablets. VI. Wet mixing method: Dried coprecipitates and \"y-A1203 were mixed in water, stirred, filtered, dried, calcined and moulded under pressure into tablets. VII. Dry mixing method: Calcined coprecipitates and \"y-A1203 were mixed, ground, and moulded under pressure into tablets. It is evident that the contact separation of the two kinds of active sites in bifunctional catalysts becomes shorter step by step from methods VII to I. 2.3. Catalytic synthesis of DME Catalytic synthesis of DME from synthesis gas was evaluated in a fixed-bed flow microreactor with 1.0 g packed catalyst. Feed gases must be dehydrated and deoxidized before flowing into reactor. Catalysts were reduced in flowing He at 230C for 4 h. The gases which evolved out of the reactor were analyzed by gas chromatography. Q. Ge et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 23 30 25 2.4. Characterization of catalysts Catalyst samples were characterized using the pow- der XRD on Rigaku Dmax-B diffractometer with CuK~ radiation, temperature programmed reduction (TPR) in a flow reaction system with 50 mg of catalyst sample, Pyridine-TPD, CO2-TPD and XPS on a PHI 550 photoelectron spectrometer which was produced by Perkin-Elmer company. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Reaction properties of b!J'unctional catalysts for direct conversion from synthesis gas to DME CuO/ZnO/A1203 catalysts prepared by seven dif- ferent methods were evaluated under the same reac- tion conditions (290, 4.0MPa, 1500h-~, H2/ CO=2, 5% CO2). The results (Table l) show that catalytic activity and selectivity of catalysts prepared by methods IV to VII are higher than those of catalysts prepared by methods I to III. Among these catalysts, the catalyst prepared by method V - coprecipitating sedimentation method developed in our laboratory - has the best catalytic activity and selectivity, with 82.2% CO conversion and 96.4% DME selectivity (in organic products). The order of catalytic activity of catalysts prepared by different methods is V>VI>VII>IV>III>II~I. Therefore, catalytic activity was not proportional to the contact separation of the two kinds of active sites in bifunctional catalysts. Catalytic activities of the catalysts including different dehydration components are shown in Table 2 under the same conditions (4.0MPa, 1500h-1, H2:CO=2, 5% CO2).

Ge et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 23-30 that catalysts including different dehydration compo- nents have different catalytic activities. Catalysts including HZSM-5 or HSY exhibited the highest catalytic activity with 89% CO conversion and 99% DME selectivity (in organic products); catalysts including HX or HY or 7-A1203 also exhibit higher catalytic activity. In addition, after dehydration com- ponents were added into catalytic components for methanol formation. The thermodynamic equilibrium for methanol synthesis on the catalyst can be broken and conversion of CO will increase dramatically. 3.2. Characterization of catalysts The results of XRD characterization (Fig. 1) show that: XRD spectra of catalysts prepared by methods IV to VII are identical, chemical species of catalysts are also identical (CuO, ZnO, \"/-A1203).

For method I, the catalysts include not only CuO and \"/-A120> but one new species ZnA1204; for method II, only CuO peaks are observed; for method III, the numbers and species of all peaks do not change, but peak strength increases dramatically. This indicates that catalyst components dispersion decreases. All the above fac- tors can result in decreasing activity of the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 2, after dehydration components HZSM-5 or ~/-AlzO3 were added into CuO-ZnO- AlzQ catalyst, XRD spectra of the catalysts neither have any new peak nor lose any peak of active species, but all peaks become weaker and wider. This shows that the dispersion of active components increases. Therefore, adding HZSM-5 or \"y'-A1203 will increase the dispersion of components and increase the activity of the catalysts. The TPR profiles of catalysts prepared by methods IV to VII shown in Fig. 3 are similar: their reducing peak temperatures are lower than those of pure CuO/ ZnO components.

However, catalysts prepared by methods I to III have higher reduced temperatures than pure CuO/ ZnO components. The reducing peak temperatures of catalysts includ- ing different dehydration components are shown in Table 3. The results show that reducing peak tempera- tures among the catalysts containing different dehy- dration components are different. The catalysts which have low reducing peak temperatures exhibit the high catalytic activity. If dehydration components are added into catalysts, it can increase the dispersion of each component. Components for methanol forma- tion and dehydration components have a 'synergistic effect' that makes copper and zinc components more active and reduced more easily. The strength of the 'synergistic effect' is different with different dehydra- tion components. Considering XRD and TPR characterization, cata- lysts prepared by methods IV to VII are identical. Therefore, TPD and XPS characterization of catalysts prepared by methods IV to VII were done. In addition, catalysts including different dehydration components were characterized using TPD. Dehydration step is considered to occur on the acidic sites of catalyst dehydration components [16,17]. So the properties of acidic sites have been researched by the pyridine-TPD characterization of catalysts From the results shown in Fig. 4 on the catalysts prepared by different methods, the following conclu- sion could be drawn: (1) Dehydration components '7-A1203 have acidic sites with two kinds of strength - weak acidic sites corresponding to low-temperature desorption sites and strong acidic sites corresponding to high-temperature desorption sites. (2) Compared to \"~'-A1203, catalysts prepared by methods IV to VII have more acidic sites which have stronger weak acidic strength, but the strengths of strong acidic sites have no evident change. In addition, from methods IV to VII, the weak acidic sites become gradually stronger 28 Q.

Therefore, it can be suggested that the dehy- dration step of the reaction occurs on the weak acidic sites and the ability of dehydration component is increased when components for methanol synthesis were added into the dehydration component. (3) Cata- lysts prepared by method IV have not shown the expected activity and selectivity. This may be because the two kinds of active centres were much closer, so that part of active centres for methanol synthesis covered part of dehydration centres. Thus, these fac- tors decrease the ability of dehydration and affect catalyst activity. This could be concluded from the peak areas becoming smaller. Pyridine-TPD profiles of catalysts including differ- ent dehydration components are shown in Fig. 5. The results in Fig. 5 show that: (1) Each dehydration component has acid centres with two kinds of strength: strong acid centres corresponding to high- temperature desorption sites and weak acid centres corresponding to low-temperature desorption sites. (2) Compared to pure dehydration component, the cata- lysts have more weak acid centres which have stronger acid strength, but the strong acid centres have no evident change. Therefore, considering our research work and some references, for e.g. [18], we think that the dehydration step of the reaction occurs on the weak 360 450 \"'B'-'\": \" \"'\" ...... .,\" ..i~.-..~j/ -~ I I I I I 150 250 350 450 550 650 750 Temperature ( o C ) Fig. 5.

According to this, we also concluded that the dehydration step of the reaction occurs on the concentrating weak acidic sites. In addition, we find that weak acidic sites and basic sites of dehydration components have the following relationships: the strengths of weak basic sites become weaker as those of weak acidic sites become strong (Figs. 4 and 6). XPS characterization of catalysts prepared by dif- ferent methods was carried out. XPS results shown in Table 4 exhibit that components for methanol synth- esis were composed of CuO and ZnO. The binding energy of Cu 2P3/2 decreased and the binding energy of Zn 2P3/2 increased step by step from methods VII to IV. It was because of the coexistence of CuO and ZnO results in the electron transfer from Zn to Cu, and the Table 4 XPS results of catalysts Catalysts Binding energy (ev) Cu 2P3/2 Zn 2P3/2 CuO/ZnO 933.8 1021.6 CuO/ZnO/A1203(VII) 933.7 1021.7 CuO/ZnO/A1203(VI) 933.6 1021.8 CuO/ZnO/AI203(V) 933.5 1022.1 CuO/ZnO/AI~O3(IV) 933.5 1022.2 electron transfer increased with increasing contact of two kinds of active centres [19,20]. Thus, it could be concluded that \"y'-A1203 and copper, zinc components have affected each other. The effects of two kinds of components affect activity and selectivity of bifunc- tional catalysts. Such a conclusion corresponds to that drawn above. 4. Conclusion Coprecipitate sedimentation method is the best preparation method for direct conversion of synthesis gas to DME. HZSM-5 and HSY are the best dehydra- tion components; catalysts including HZSM-5 or HSY exhibit excellent catalytic activity with 89% CO con- version and 99% DME selectivity (in organic pro- ducts). The dehydration step of the syngas conversion to DME occurs on the weak acidic sites formed in bifunctional catalysts. To prepare catalysts which have excellent catalytic activities, the following suggestions can be recom- mended: (1) The two kinds of active centres, which keep their catalytic functions, should closely contact and exhibit 'synergistic effect'. (2) One kind of active centres should not cover another kind of active cen- tres. (3) Each component of any catalyst should not react with any other components in order to avoid forming new inactive chemical species. 30 Q.

Bifunctional catalysts for conversion of synthesis gas to dimethyl ether Qingjie Ge Youmei Huang * Fengyan Qiu Shuben Li Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou 730000, China * Corresponding author. The effects of preparation methods and dehydration components on catalytic properties and the structures of bifunctional catalysts were investigated. Catalytic synthesis of dimethyl ether from synthesis gas was evaluated in a fixed-bed flow microreactor at a pressure of 4.0 MPa and a GHSV of 1500 h−1. Characterization of catalysts has been carried out using XRD, TPR, Pyridine-TPD, CO2-TPD and XPS. The experimental results show that CuOZnOAl2O3/HZSM-5 and CuOZnOAl2O3/HSY catalysts, which were prepared by a coprecipitating sedimentation method, exhibit the highest catalytic activity for direct synthesis of dimethyl ether from synthesis gas with 89% CO conversion and 99% selectivity of dimethyl ether (in organic products). In addition, the results indicate that the dehydration step of the reaction occurs on the weak acidic sites and there is a ‘synergistic effect’ between the two kinds of active components in bifunctional catalysts.
