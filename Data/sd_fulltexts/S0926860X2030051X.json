Graphical abstract In a Ni-MoS2/Al2O3 catalyst, when the edges of the MoS2 nanoslabs are decorated by Ni atoms, the HDN activity can be remarkably enhanced: the Ni atoms one hand activate H2 to produce activated hydrogen which afterwards react with Mo-S2− species to form Mo-SH species, and on the other hand increase the basicity of the neighboring basic Mo-S2−, which together promote the cracking of the CN bonds. A monometallic catalyst MoS2/Al2O3 and a Ni-promoting catalyst NiMoS2/Al2O3 were prepared through using nano-sized MoS3 particles as the precursor. XPS analysis combined with a DBT probe test indicate that, compared with the conventional catalyst Ref-MoS2/Al2O3 derived from nano-sized MoO3 particles, the MoS3-derived catalyst MoS2/Al2O3 not only contains nearly fully-sulfided Mo species, but also holds much more coordination unsaturated sites (CUS) on its MoS2 nanoslabs, thus resulting in the successful preparation of a bimetallic catalyst NiMoS2/Al2O3 with much weaker Mo-Al2O3 interaction and higher decoration degree of Ni atoms onto MoS2 nanoslabs as compared with the conventional counterpart. These significant structural advantages of the bimetallic catalysts not only avoid the strong interference of γ-Al2O3 to the active phase, but also bring potential excellent Ni-promoting effects on the catalytic activity. Then, using quinolone (Q) as the reactant, the Ni-promoting effect on the hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) activity was discussed. It was found when MoS2 nanoslabs were decorated by Ni atoms, the HDN activity attains an essential improvement. Moreover, this Ni-promoting effect is much more beneficial to the Path II (Q→14THQ/58THQ→DHQ→PCHA→PCHE + PCH) than Path I (Q→14THQ→OPA→PB). The origin of Ni-promoting effects on HDN activity was finally suggested: Ni atoms one hand activate H2 to produce activated hydrogen which afterwards react with Mo-S2− species to form Mo-SH species, and on the other hand increase the basicity of the neighboring Mo-S2−, which together promote the cracking of CN bonds and thereby remarkably enhance the HDN activity. Keywords Hydrodenitrogenation Ni-promoting effect Hydrogenation Hydrogenolysis 1 Introduction Nowadays, with the crude oil becoming increasingly heavier and the environmental regulations getting continuously stricter, the existing refining and ungrading technologies are facing huge challenges [1,2]. Moreover, the increasing nitrogen-containing compounds in the petroleum oils not only bring serious environmental pollutions through NOx emissions, but also severely affect the efficiency of a lot of refining processes or reactions, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and hydrodesulfurization (HDS) [1–3]. Therefore, developing more active hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) catalyst has become one of the most urgent solutions. So far, γ-Al2O3-supported MoS2 or/and WS2 nanoslabs promoted by Ni or Co atoms are still the most-used catalytic systems in different hydrogenation reactions, such as HDS, hydrodearomatization (HDA), hydrodemetallization (HDM) and HDN [4–6]. In the past several decades, extensive studies have proved the decoration of Ni or Co atoms onto the edge sites of MoS2 or WS2 nanoslabs can exponentially enhance the intrinsic activity [7–9]. Furthermore, the promoting role of Ni or Co atoms has been stated by many models, and among them Ni(Co)-Mo(W)-S model proposed by Topsøe et al. are the most generally accepted [4,7,10,11]. However, so far, it seems that most of studies about the promoting effect focus on the HDS reactions [9,12–15], whereas few pay attention to the effect on HDN reactions. Considering the obviously different reaction mechanisms bewtween HDN and HDS [16–18], the currenttheoritical models are probably not enough to help understand the “structure-function” relations of HDN catalysts. Threfore, fundamental studies on the promoting role of Ni/Co in HDN activity should attain more widespread attention. Moreover, the current studies almost focused on the conventional oxidic catalysts (e.g. NiO-MoO3/AlO3) which need to be reduced by a sulfurizing reagent before use, such as CS2 and dimethyl [2,19–21]. Numerous studies have pointed out [22–26], both impregnation and calcination steps in the conventional impregnation method could induce a strong interaction between the metal species (such as NiMoS, MoS2, NiSx, and etc.) and the alumina support. Therefore, there actually exists a strong interference from the support to the active phases, thus leading to an difficulty to accurately study the catalytic structure-function relations, including the Ni-promoting effects on the HDN activity. Herein, a nearly fully-sulfided MoS2/Al2O3 containing more CUS was first prepared, and then a bimetallic NiMoS2/Al2O3 with much weaker Mo-Al2O3 interaction and higher decoration degree of Ni atoms onto MoS2 nanoslabs as compared with the conventional counterpart was obtained. The significant structural advantages of the bimetallic catalysts can not only avoid the strong interference of γ-Al2O3 to the active phase, but also provide potential excellent Ni-promoting effects on the catalytic activity. Finally, using Q as the reactant, the Ni-promoting effects on the HDN activity were studied and discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The monometallic catalyst denoted as MoS2/Al2O3 was prepared according to the following procedures. Firstly, under stirring, 4.5 mL 2.4 M HCl was added into a 15.5 mL solution containing 1.44 g thioacetamide and 1.45 g sodium molybdate to yield a 20 mL solution with pH = 4.5. Secondly, the resulting solution was added into a 100-ml rotary Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave containing 3.5 g γ-Al2O3 extrudates (97.7 % Al2O3, average diameter of 1.5 mm, surfaces area of 230 m2 g−1, pore volume of 0.6 mL g−1, supplied by Sinopec Research Institute of Petroleum Processing) and 40.0 mL anhydrous ethanol, heated at 84 °C for 12 h. Thirdly, the solids were filtered, washed with anhydrous ethanol, and dried at 100 °C in N2 atmosphere for 4 h to obtain alumina-supported MoS3 nanoparticles denoted as MoS3/Al2O3, which has been reported by the previous studies [27,28]. Finally, MoS3/Al2O3 was treated under an atmophere of H2 at 500 °C for 4 h to prepare catalyst MoS2/Al2O3. Its Mo content was ca. 10.0 wt.%, detected by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) analysis. For comparison purpose, the conventional monometallic catalyst (denoted as Ref-MoS2/Al2O3) with the same Mo content was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of Al2O3 with a (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O solution, followed by the drying procedure (120 °C for 2 h in a N2 atmosphere), calcination procedure (450 °C for 3 h in an air atmosphere) and sulfidation procedure (360 °C for 4 h in a 15 vol.% H2S/H2 atmosphere). The bimetallic catalyst denoted as NiMoS2/Al2O3 was prepared by impregnating the MoS3/Al2O3 composite with a Ni(CH3COO)2 solution at a Ni/Mo molar ratio of 3:7, followed by a drying treatment (100 °C for 2 h in a N2 atmosphere) and a thermal treatment (500 °C for 4 h in a 15 vol.% H2S/H2 atmosphere). The Mo content and Ni content of NiMoS2/Al2O3 determined by XRF analysis are ca. 9.7 wt.% and ca. 2.7 wt.%, respectively. Similarly, the conventional bimetallic catalyst (denoted as Ref-NiMoS2/Al2O3) with the same metal loadings was prepared through the same preparation procedures used in preparation of Ref-MoS2/Al2O3, except for using a mixed solution of Ni(NO3)2 and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O instead of the (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O solution. 2.2 Characterizations XRF analysis was operated on a Rigaku ZSX-100e instrument to determine the metal loadings of the catalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on a VG Scientific ESCALab250 spectrometer using Al Kα radiation. The samples were crushed into powder and kept in a cyclohexane solvent to prevent oxidation. Before measurement, the samples were pressed onto a stainless steel sample holder in air; the holder was immediately moved on the XPS machine. The quantification of surface element contents was done using sensitivity factors provided with VG software. Especially, Mo species’ and Ni species’ chemical states (denoted as Mo4+, Mo5+, Mo6+ and Ni-Mo-S, NiS, Ni shake up, respectively) and their contents can be distinguished and quantified by XPS spectra fitted by XPSPEAK software (Version 4.1). In order to determine the relative quantity of CUS in MoS2 nanoslabs of the two monometallic catalysts mentioned above, a DBT probe test was carried out on a continuously flowing fixed-bed microreactor using dibenzothiophene (DBT) as the probe molecule. The rationality about this analysis method will be discussed in Section 3.1. In the test, 1.0 wt.% DBT in heptane was chosen as the model reactant. The main operation conditions are controlled as follows: reaction temperature from 300 to 360 °C, hydrogen partial pressure 4.0 MPa, and H2/oil volumetric ratio 500:1. Besides, it is worthy to note that, the product selectivity should be determined at below 50 % of total DBT conversion, and hence the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) needs to be adjusted in accordance with the change of the reaction temperature. After a stabilization period of 4 h, the reaction products were collected every two hours and analyzed using an HP 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) installed with a flame ionization detector and a 0.25 mm ×100 m dimethylpolysiloxane capillary column. 2.3 Activity assessment The activity assessment tests of the monometallic MoS2/Al2O3 and the bimetallic NiMoS2/Al2O3 were operated in the above-mentioned continuously flowing fixed-bed microreactor. The operation procedures are described as follows. Firstly, 0.50 g catalyst of 40–60 mesh in diameter was first diluted with quartz particles of 0.25 mm in diameter and then loaded into the flat-temperature zone of the reactor. Secondly, using 1.0 wt.% Q in heptane as the model reactant, the Q-HDN activities of the four catalysts were assessed under the following operating conditions: a temperature of 360 °C, a hydrogen partial pressure of 4.0 MPa, a LHSV of 20 h−1, and a H2/oil volumetric ratio of 500:1. Thirdly, after a stabilization period of 4 h, the products were collected every 2 h and analyzed by a HP 6890 GC instrument. Besides, the Q-HDN product selectivity over the four catalysts were also studied by modifying the LHSV and H2/oil volumetric ratio simultaneously while fixing the other reaction conditions (in order to control the total conversion of Q at ca. 60 %), and the LHSV and the H2/oil volumetric ratio used for the two monometallic catalysts were 40 h−1 and 300:1, respectively, and those used for the two bimetallic catalyst were 60 h−1 and 150:1, respectively. 2.4 Activity analysis methods HDN of Q (Q-HDN) is assumed as a pseudo-first-order reaction. The reaction activity was expressed by the following formula [29], (1) K HDN = F m ln ( 1 1 − τ ) where KHDN are the rate constants of Q-HDN in mol g−1 s−1, respectively, F is the feeding rate of Q in mol s−1, m is the mass of the catalyst in gram, and τ is the total conversion of Q. Q-HDN involves all reactions that take place in an industrial HDN process, and hence it was often used as the model reactant in many studies [1,2]. The Q-HDN network is shown in Fig.1 , and it includes two reaction pathways: Path I is Q→1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (14THQ)→o-propylaniline (OPA)→ propylbenzene (PB) and Path II is Q→14THQ/5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoline (58THQ) →decahydroquinoline (DHQ)→propylcyclohexylamine (PCHA)→ propycyclohexene (PCHE)→propycyclohexane (PCH). Herein, the hydrogenation reactions of heterocyclic ring and benzene ring were denoted as HYD, and the CN bond cleavage (i.e. hydrogenolysis) reactions were denoted as DN. It is well accepted that, due to the higher stability of CN bond than CN, the Q-HDN needs to first proceed via the HYD reactions and then undergo the DN reactions [30–32]. In the present work, the ratio of (PCHE + PCH) selectivity to PB selectivity was used to express the respective contribution of Path I and Path II to the total HDN activity. The two paths’ denitrogenation activities were expressed by Formula (4) and Formula (5), respectively. (4) k I = K H D N × S P B (5) k II = K H D N × S P C H E + P C H where SPB and SPCHE+PCH represent the product selectivity of Path I and Path II, respectively; kI and kII represent the denitrogenation reaction rate constants of Path I and Path II, respectively, and their sum is the total denitrogenation reaction rate constant, denoted as kHDN . It is very worthy to note that, kHDN does not mean KHDN , and the latter is the total conversion rate constant, involving the denitrogenation reactions and the intermediate reactions. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization results of MoS2/Al2O3 and NiMoS2/Al2O3 catalysts The XRF and N2 adsorption-desorption characterization results of the γ-Al2O3 and the four catalysts are listed in Table 1 , which clearly shows that either the two monometallic catalyst or the two bimetallic catalysts have nearly the same elemental compositions and the same textural properties, which facilitates to distinguish the advantages of using MoS3 nanoparticles instead of the conventional MoO3 or MoOx nanoparticles as the precursor. Herein, it is worthy to note that, in the previous studies [27,28,33,34], the successful synthesis of MoS3/Al2O3 have been proved by XPS and XRD analysis, and it wouldn’t be repeated here. For analyzing the sulfidation degree of the Mo species of the four catalysts, their Mo3d XPS spectra were measured and fitted, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The binding energies of the Mo3d5/2 and Mo3d3/2 levels for Mo4+ (MoS2) are about 229.0 and 232.1 eV, those for Mo5+ (MoOxSy) are about 230.4 and 233.6 eV, those for Mo6+ (MoO3) are about 232.5 and 235.7 eV and that for the S2s level are about 226.2 eV [23,28]. The results clearly show that, the Mo3d spectra of the two MoS3-derived catalysts MoS2/Al2O3 and NiMoS2/Al2O3 are obviously different from those of the two conventional MoO3-derived catalysts Ref-MoS2/Al2O3 and Ref-NiMoS2/Al2O3. The former two spectra both contain characteristic peaks of MoS2, MoOxSy and MoO3, while the latter two spectra mainly show the characteristic peaks of MoS2. The sulfidation degree of molybdenum species denoted as Mosul , is defined as the ratio of Mo4+ (MoS2) to the sum of Mo4+ (MoS2), Mo5+ (MoOxSy) and Mo6+ (MoO3), i.e., Mosul = Mo4+/(Mo4+ + Mo5+ + Mo6+) [23,28]. The fitting results in Table 2 show that Mosul of MoS2/Al2O3 and NiMoS2/Al2O3 are 98.2 % and 95.3 %, respectively, much higher than those of Ref-MoS2/Al2O3 and Ref-NiMoS2/Al2O3, i.e. 75.2 % and 79.8 %. Actually, the Mosul is often used to reflect the strength of the Mo-Al2O3 interaction, and the larger of Mosul , the weaker of the Mo-Al2O3 interaction [22,23,27]. Therefore, the above results indicate that the Mo-Al2O3 interaction of (Ni)MoS2/Al2O3 is much weaker than that of Ref-(Ni)MoS2. Moreover, the XPS analysis results about the surface atomic ratio S/Mo of the two monometallic catalysts show that, MoS2/Al2O3 has a much lower S/Mo ratio than its counterpart Ref-MoS2/Al2O3 (1.65 vs. 1.88), indicating the MoS2 nanoslabs of the former probably possesses a very “sulphur-deficient” edge structure. Considering the fact that Mo species in Ref-MoS2/Al2O3 are not fully sulfided as compared with MoS2/Al2O3, the above analysis results about “sulphur-deficient” are not very convincing. To solve this problem, a DBT probe tests was carried out to determine the relative quantity of CUS (i.e. “sulphur-deficient” sites) in the two monometallic catalysts, and the results are shown in Fig.4 . It is well known that, DBT-HDS proceeds through two pathways [23,35]: one is the direct desulfurization (DDS) route to produce biphenyl (BP), and another is the hydrogenation (HYD) route to yield cyclohexylbenzene (CHB), little dicyclohexyl (DCH), and two intermediate products, i.e. tetrahydrodibenzothiophene (THDBT) and hexahydrodibenzothiophene (HHDBT). Hence,the BP/(CHB + BCH) selectivity (see Fig.4) is generally used to express the DDS/HYD selectivity. It can be clearly seen from Fig.4 that, no matter what the temperature is, the BP/(CHB + BCH) selectivity is always ca. 6 times higher than that of Ref-MoS2/Al2O3. Taking into account the widely proved viewpoint that CUS are the active sites of DDS [4,11,36,37], this result actually indicates that MoS2/Al2O3 with lower atomic S/Mo ratio (1.65) indeed possesses much more CUS than Ref-MoS2/Al2O3 with a higher atomic S/Mo ratio (1.88), which is well consistent with the above XPS analysis. The Ni2p spectra and the corresponding deconvoluted curves of NiMoS2/Al2O3 and Ref-NiMoS2/Al2O3 are displayed in Fig.5 . The peak at about 854.1 eV is assigned to Ni-Mo-S active phase, that at about 853.2 eV is assigned to Ni sulfides (NiSx), that at about 856.7 eV is assigned to the oxidic Ni2+ species (i.e., NiOx, including NiAl2O4 and NiO) [38]. Besides, the peak at about 862.5 eV is ascribed to the shake up of the oxidic Ni2+ species [38]. Fig.5 shows that the Ni2p spectra of the two bimetallic catalysts contain the same characteristic peaks of Ni-Mo-S phase and the oxidic Ni2+ species. The decoration degree of Ni atoms onto MoS2 nanoslabs (denoted as NiNiMoS/Nitotal) is calculated according to the following methods [39,40]. NiNiMoS/Nitotal is equal to the molar ratio of Ni2+ in Ni-Mo-S phase (denoted as NiNiMoS) to the sum of NiNiMoS, Ni2+ in NiSx phase (denoted as NiNiSx), and the oxidic Ni2+ (denoted as NiNiOx), i.e., NiNiMoS/Nitotal=NiNiMoS/(NiNiMoS+NiNiSx+NiNiOx). The NiNiMoS/Nitotal values of the two catalysts are also listed in Table 2, which shows that NiMoS2/Al2O3 has much larger NiNiMoS/Nitotal (46.7 %) than Ref-NiMoS2/Al2O3, indicating that besides greatly increasing the Mosul , using MoS3/Al2O3 as the precursor could also greatly improve the Ni-decoration degree to form more NiMoS active sites. many researchers have pointed out that, during the thermal treatment of MoS3 nanoparticles, a great number of “sulphur-deficient” sites will be generated on the edge surface of MoS2 crystallites [41,42]. Moreover, these generated sites can effectively accommodate the promoter atoms to form Ni(Co)MoS sites [27,28]. To sum up, through using nano-sized MoS3 particles as the precursor, a nearly fully-sulfided monometallic cataltst MoS2/Al2O3 containing more CUS was successfully prepared, thus resulting in the successful fabrication of a bimetallic catalyst NiMoS2/Al2O3 with much weaker Mo-Al2O3 interaction and higher decoration degree of Ni atoms onto MoS2 nanoslabs as compared with the conventional counterpart. These significant structural advantages of the bimetallic catalysts, not only avoid the strong interference of the alumina support to the active phase, but also provide potential excellent Ni-promoting effects onto the catalytic activity, thus facilitating to accurately understand the Ni-promoting effects on the HDN activity. 3.2 Ni-promoting effects on HDN activity of Q The HDN activity assessment results of MoS2/Al2O3, Ref-MoS2/Al2O3, NiMoS2/Al2O3 and Ref-NiMoS2/Al2O3 are listed in Table 3 . It clearly shows the HDN activity (kHDN = 0.05 × 10−8 mol g-1 s-1) of MoS2/Al2O3 is much lower than that (kHDN = 0.39 × 10−8 mol g-1 s-1) of its counterpart, i.e. Ref-MoS2/Al2O3. However, NiMoS2/Al2O3 holds much higher HDN activity than Ref-NiMoS2/Al2O3 (i.e. kHDN = 2.68 × 10−8 mol g-1 s-1 v.s. kHDN = 1.87 × 10−8 mol g-1 s-1). According to the above XPS analysis and the DBT probe test results, the much lower HDN activity of MoS2/Al2O3 than Ref-MoS2/Al2O3 can be attributed to the much more CUS and the resultant much less Mo-SH/S2- species on MoS2 nanoslabs, and Mo-SH/S2- species are actually the active sites of CN bond cleavage, as proved by the previous study [27]. However, the much higher HDN activtiy of NiMoS2/Al2O3 than Ref-NiMoS2/Al2O3 is originated from the formation of more Ni-Mo-S active sites during the thermal process of the precursor, i.e. nano-sized MoS3, as proved by the above XPS analysis. Furthermore, through comparing the kHDN of MoS2/Al2O3 with NiMoS2/Al2O3, it can be seen after MoS2/Al2O3 was decorated by Ni atoms, the activity is enhanced by more than 52 times, which is great larger than the difference (only ca. 4 times) between Ref-MoS2/Al2O3 and Ref-NiMoS2/Al2O3, indicating that the MoS3-derived bimetallic catalyst has more significant Ni-promoting effects, than the conventional MoO3-derived bimetallic catalyst [23–25]. Moreover, the Ni-promoting effects on the two reaction pathways of Q (Path I and Path II) were studied and the results are also listed in Table 3. Details about the calculation method and procedure are introduced in Section 2.3. Results show whatever precursors (MoS3 or MoO3) are used, once the Ni atoms were introduced, both k I and k II increases greatly, indicating that the activities of Path I (Q→14THQ→OPA→PB) and Path II (Q→14THQ/58THQ→DHQ→PCHA→PCHE + PCH) were both greatly enhanced by the Ni-promoting effects. Although for either the two monometallic or the two bimetallic catalysts, the kII is always much larger than kI , the kII/kI values of the two bimetallic catalysts are much higher than those of the two monometallic ones, especially that (6.89) of NiMoS2/Al2O3. These results indicate the Ni-promoting effect is more beneficial to the Path II. The larger contribution to the total HDN activity of Path II than Path I could be attributed to the obviously stronger adsorption of the intermediate DHQ in Path II onto the active sites, as compared with the intermediate OPA in Path I, which has been widely proved in the previous studies [1,2,32,43–45]. Besides, the co-existence of the other molecules including Q, 14THQ and 58THQ could further suppress the activity of Path I [43,44]. 3.3 Ni-promoting effects on the HDN selectivity of Q In order to understand why the Ni atoms impose more remarkable promoting effects on Path II than Path I, the HDN product selectivity over the four catalysts were analyzed and the results are listed in Table 4 . It shows for MoS2/Al2O3 and Ref-MoS2/Al2O3, 14THQ and 58THQ (HYD intermediate products) are the main products, whereas the DN products (including OPA, PB, PCHE and PCH) account for only 9.1 % and 24.6 %, respectively. As discussed above, the higher selectivity of DN products over Ref-MoS2/Al2O3 than MoS2/Al2O3 is due to the more Mo-SH/S2− species which are the active sites of CN cleavage. However, when the Ni atoms were introduced onto MoS3/Al2O3, followed by thermal treatment under a H2 atomophere at 500 °C to yield NiMoS2/Al2O3, the (PCH + PCHE + PB) selectivity greatly increases from 4.0 % to 58.7 %, and thereupon the (14THQ+58THQ + DHQ) selectivity sharply decreases from 90.9 % to 38.4 %. The similar phenomenon can be observed after comparing Ref- MoS2/Al2O3 and Ref-NiMoS2/Al2O3, although it is not so pronounced. These results indicate that the Ni-promoting effects essentially promote the cleavage of CN bonds. Besides, it is worthy to note that, due to the high reactivity, no PCHA (an intermediate product of Path II) was detected, which is consistent with most of the studies [1,31,43]. Moreover, the (PCHE + PCH) selectivity and PB selectivity are simultaneously enhanced, indicating that the Ni-promoting effects are not only favorable to Path II (Q→14THQ/58THQ→DHQ→PCHA→PCHE + PCH), but also beneficial to Path I (Q→14THQ→OPA→PB), which is well consistent with the viewpoints from Gutiérrez et al. [19]. Besides, it is very worthy to note that, both NiMoS2/Al2O3 and Ref-NiMoS2/Al2O3 exhibits a considerable DHQ selectivity with 14.1 % and 15.3 %, respectively, while their corresponding monometallic catalysts both have no DHQ selectivity. This result indicates that the rate-determining step of Path II over the bimetallic catalysts is different from that over the monometallic catalysts, and the former is the ring-open reaction of DHQ→PCHA, whereas the latter is the ring-hydrogenation reaction of 14THQ/58THQ→DHQ, which is consistent with the previous study [27]. This transformation of the rate-determining step of Path II powerfully implies Ni atoms could remarkably increase the hydrogenation activity, especially the double-ring hydrogenation activity of Q to form more DHQ. 3.4 Origin of the Ni-promoting effects on the HDN activity Before discussing the origin of the above Ni-promoting effects, it should be first to distinguish the active sites for different reactions. It has been generally considered that there are two type active sites in a HDN catalyst [2,20,45,46]: one is for HYD and another one is for DN. The former is related with the CUS sites and brim sites [4,15] and the latter is connected with Mo–SH and Mo-S2− sites, i.e. the Brønsted (B) acid sites and its adjacent Lewis base sites, which have been taken as the active sites of DN by the two best proved CN bond cleavage mechanisms, i.e. Hofmann elimination and nucleophilic substitution [1,17]. In other words, every CN bond cleavage actually requires the cooperation of an acidic –SH site and an adjacent basic S2− site. Based on the above activity and selectivity assessment results, it can be concluded that, both the monometallic catalyst and the bimetallic catalyst have the excellent HYD activity, but only when the edges of MoS2 nanoslabs are decorated by Ni atoms to form NiMoS sites, both the total HDN activity and DN activity can be remarkably enhanced. In other words, the key factor influencing the total HDN activity is the CN cleavage ability. Finally, the origin of Ni-promoting effects on HDN, i.e., DN, is proposed, as illustrated in Fig.6 . It can be seen Ni atoms replace part of the Mo atoms on the edges of MoS2 nanoslabs, which on one hand promotes the activation of hydrogen and thereby catalyze the reaction between activated hydrogen and Mo-S species to yield more acidic Mo-SH species, and on the other hand increases the electron cloud density of the neighboring basic Mo-S2- species by the electron-rich d-orbitals of Ni atoms. These two effects together promote the CN bond cleavage. In fact, the similar viewpoints have been given by Gutiérrez et al. recently by using DHQ and DBT as the reactants [19]. They found the DN reaction of DHQ→PCHA proceeds through the cooperation of the acidic Mo-SH groups and their neighboring basic Mo-S2− species, and in the presence of DBT, the parallel conversion of DBT via DDS could help recover the Mo-S2− sepcies and Mo-SH groups and thus accelerate the rate of the C(sp3)-N bond cleavage of the heterocyclic ring. Besides, the activating-hydrogen ability of the Ni atoms in NiSx species or NiMoS phase in the bimetallic catalysts can further guarantee the excellent HYD activity [45,47], which is another reason for the present work to only discuss the Ni-promoting effects on DN. 4 Conclusions In summary, a fully-sulfided monometallic catalyst MoS2/Al2O3 containing much more CUS was successfully prepared via using nano-sized MoS3 as the precursor, thus resulting in the successful fabrication of a bimetallic catalyst NiMoS2/Al2O3 with much weaker Mo-Al2O3 interaction and higher Ni-decoration degree of Ni atoms onto MoS2 nanoslabs as compared with the conventional counterpart. The significant structural advantages of the bimetallic catalysts, not only avoid the strong interference of the alumina support to the active phase, but also provide potential excellent Ni-promoting effects onto the catalytic activity, thus facilitating to accurately investigate the Ni-promoting effects on the HDN activity. Then using Q as the reactant, the Ni-promoting effects on the HDN activity were well discussed. It was found that when Ni atoms decorate the edges of MoS2 nanoslabs to form NiMoS sites, the HDN activity attains essential improvement, which is much more beneficial to the Path II than Path I. Finally, the origin of Ni-promoting effects on DN was suggested: the decorated Ni on the edges of MoS2 nanoslabs one hand activates H2 to produce activated hydrogen which afterwards react with the Mo-S2− species to form Mo-SH species, and on the other hand increases the basicity of the neighboring basic Mo-S2−, which together promote the cracking of the CN bonds and thereby greatly enhance the HDN activity. The results indicate that, for developing high-efficient HDN catalysts, it should be tried best to develop novel preparation methods or modification technologies to improve the decoration of the promoter atoms onto Mo(W)S2 phases, and meanwhile prevent the formation of other inert species, such as NiSx, Co9S8, NiAl2O4, and so on.

        "dc:description": "A monometallic catalyst MoS2/Al2O3 and a Ni-promoting catalyst NiMoS2/Al2O3 were prepared through using nano-sized MoS3 particles as the precursor. XPS analysis combined with a DBT probe test indicate that, compared with the conventional catalyst Ref-MoS2/Al2O3 derived from nano-sized MoO3 particles, the MoS3-derived catalyst MoS2/Al2O3 not only contains nearly fully-sulfided Mo species, but also holds much more coordination unsaturated sites (CUS) on its MoS2 nanoslabs, thus resulting in the successful preparation of a bimetallic catalyst NiMoS2/Al2O3 with much weaker Mo-Al2O3 interaction and higher decoration degree of Ni atoms onto MoS2 nanoslabs as compared with the conventional counterpart. These significant structural advantages of the bimetallic catalysts not only avoid the strong interference of γ-Al2O3 to the active phase, but also bring potential excellent Ni-promoting effects on the catalytic activity. Then, using quinolone (Q) as the reactant, the Ni-promoting effect on the hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) activity was discussed. It was found when MoS2 nanoslabs were decorated by Ni atoms, the HDN activity attains an essential improvement. Moreover, this Ni-promoting effect is much more beneficial to the Path II (Q→14THQ/58THQ→DHQ→PCHA→PCHE + PCH) than Path I (Q→14THQ→OPA→PB). The origin of Ni-promoting effects on HDN activity was finally suggested: Ni atoms one hand activate H2 to produce activated hydrogen which afterwards react with Mo-S2− species to form Mo-SH species, and on the other hand increase the basicity of the neighboring Mo-S2−, which together promote the cracking of CN bonds and thereby remarkably enhance the HDN activity.",
