Graphical abstract A Re2O7-B2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was demonstrated to reveal significant activity in cyclohexene dimerization into 1-cyclohexenylcyclohexane with a total yield of 95 % and a selectivity close to 100 % in the batch mode at 75−80°C and atmospheric pressure. Keywords Bifunctional catalysis Cyclohexene 1-cyclohexenylcyclohexane Dimerization Rhenium Boron 1 Introduction Cyclic olefins are traditional raw materials for organic and petrochemical synthesis. Cyclic oligomers find use as solvents, plasticizers, components of drugs and cosmetic materials [1–3]. From this view point, dimerization of cyclohexene (CH) leading to 1-cyclohexenylcyclohexane (1−CC) is of particular interest as far as cyclohexene is considered as one of the most stable naphthenic hydrocarbons. Therefore, it is not surprising that the number of the studies devoted to the synthesis of 1−CC directly from cyclohexene is not so significant, especially the studies where the yield of 1−CC as a target product and its selectivity reach comparatively high values. Usually the formation of 1−CC was observed during oligomerization of CH in the presence of various strong acid catalysts, such as P2O5, BF3, H2SO4, HF, herewith along with 1−CC also tri- and tetramers of CH were also detected [4,5]. CH dimerization or cyclohexanol conversion into 1−CC was revealed over zeolites H-Beta and HY [6,7]. Particularly this reaction proceeded effectively over HZSM-5 zeolite with the selectivity to 1−CC close to 100 %, however the yield was below 41 %. Recently it was shown that a B2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is able to transform CH to 1−CC, with the conversion of CH approaching 76 % and the selectivity to 1−CC higher than 99 % [8]. One can assume this reaction to be the alkylation of the CH molecule by another CH molecule as a result of electrophilic substitution of hydrogen at the double bond of CH by a cyclic cation generated from another CH molecule on a Brønsted acid center of the catalyst: If to accept this reaction mechanism, it becomes obvious that the acidic properties of the heterogeneous catalyst can play a decisive role in the 1−CC formation. Nevertheless, it is of great interest to find out whether the activity of the B2O3/Al2O3 acidic catalyst in the CH dimerization can be increased by introducing an additive of Re2O7 in the catalyst composition. This oxide is known to be employed in the catalysts for olefin metathesis [9,10] due to the ability of Re to produce appropriate π-complexes with olefin compounds on the catalyst surface. There are a number of works that are devoted to metathesis reactions, both over heterogeneous and homogeneous systems, in which transformations of cyclohexene or various compounds containing olefinic cycles are considered [11–15]. In some works, the authors resort to various ways to circumvent the thermodynamic limitations with respect to the CH metathesis. However, the yields of metathesis products obtained in those cases are relatively small and do not exceed 5–6 % [12]. Under metathesis conditions, CH undergoes, mainly, the ring-opening transformations, in particular the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) [12,13]. In a few works [16,17], bicyclic 1−CC is considered only as one of the intermediate products, which is obtained in small quantities. Taking this consideration into account, the main objective of the present research is to study the influence of the Re2O7 additive to the B2O3/Al2O3 catalyst on its selectivity in the conversion of CH to 1−CC. 2 Experimental The following catalysts were used: 5%B2O3/Al2O3, 12 %Re2O7/Al2O3, 12 %Re2O7+5%B2O3/Al2O3, 12 %Re2O7+10 %B2O3/Al2O3, the oxide content in these samples is given as the mass percentage with respect to the γ-Al2O3 support (S = 196 m2/g, size of particles 0.25−0.50 mm). The details of the preparation are given in Supplementary Information (SI). The reaction was carried out in a glass reactor with a volume of 25 cm3 with 0.6–1 g of the catalyst and 2 mL of a 10−30 wt. % CH solution in n-heptane loaded into the microreactor. The reaction temperature was varied from 20° to 90°C. During the reaction, the reaction mixture was stirred at a speed of 100 rpm. In each experiment, a fresh portion of the catalyst was used. The analysis of the reaction products was carried out by GLC using a 3 m x3 mm packed column filled with SE-30/Chromaton in the temperature-programmed mode with a temperature rise from 50 to 260°C. Identification of reaction products was carried out by means of chromato-mass-spectrometry (GC–MS) with the use of a Finnigan mass-spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corporation). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured using a Bruker AM300NMR spectrometer, DMSO-d 6 and DCCl3 were used as solvents, HSQC, HMBC, APT, and NOESY methods were used for signal assignment. 3 Results and discussion TPD profiles of ammonia (Supplementary Information (SI), Fig. S1) show that the starting Al2O3 as well as B2O3 modified systems have a wide distribution of acid sites. Due to the broad range of NH3 desorption temperatures, these acid sites can be differentiated as weak, medium and strong acid sites. The calculations demonstrate that the total number of acid sites in B2O3/Al2O3 increases with the B2O3 content in the catalyst. According to the data, the number of acid sites in 5%B2O3/Al2O3 is 28 % larger than that for the alumina carrier, while the number of acid sites in 10 %B2O3/Al2O3 exceeds the number of acid sites of alumina by 45 %. The GS-MS data confirm (SI, Fig. S2) the assumption that the reaction leads actually to the 1−CC formation, moreover we achieved both a high yield and high selectivity. Fig. 1 shows the kinetic curves for the CH transformation into 1−CC obtained on three catalysts differing in the B2O3 and Re2O7 contents: 5%B2O3/Al2O3, 12 %Re2O7/Al2O3, 12 %Re2O7+5%B2O3/Al2O3. For comparison, the CH conversion over γ-Al2O3 used as a support was studied too. The data obtained show that γ-Al2O3 applied as a support exhibits a very low activity in the conversion of CH to 1−CC, the yield of 1−CC does not exceed 1%. It is interesting to note that the addition of 12 %Re2O7 to γ-Al2O3 leads only to a weak increase in the catalyst activity, and the yield of 1−CC is below 5%. Compared with the previous samples, the 5%B2O3/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrates the essentially higher activity in the conversion of CH to 1−CC with the 1−CC yield close to 14 %. The increase in the reaction rate on the 5%B2O3/Al2O3 catalyst can be caused by the presence of stronger Brønsted acid sites related with the B2O3 oxide in the catalyst. Among all the catalysts tested, the highest yield of 1−CC is found for the 12 %Re2O7+5%B2O3/Al2O3 sample containing both B2O3 and Re2O7 taken in the quantities used in the single-oxide samples. Noteworthy, the yield of 1−CC obtained over this catalyst reaches 85 %. Thus, the catalysts studied in the CH conversion into 1−CC can be arranged as follows: Al2O3 < 12 %Re2O7/Al2O3 < 5%B2O3/Al2O3 << 12 %Re2O7+5%B2O3/ Al2O3. Fig. 2 shows the data on the selectivity for the 1−CC formation over the four catalysts. According to these results, the 1−CC selectivity obtained for the double-oxide catalyst 12 %Re2O7+5%B2O3/Al2O3 (a molar ratio B2O3 : Re2O7 = 2.9 : 1) exceeds 95 %. About the same selectivity is demonstrated by the 5%B2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, however its activity in the CH dimerization is essentially lower. If compared with previous samples, the 12 % Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst containing no B2O3 exhibits a lower selectivity to 1−CC, and the Al2O3 sample demonstrates the lowest selectivity for 1−CC. These data directly show that the catalytic activity in the CH dimerization depends mainly on the acidic properties of the heterogeneous catalyst. It is important to note that, if we switch from the single-oxide contacts 12 %Re2O7/Al2O3, 5% B2O3/Al2O3 to the double-oxide system 12 %Re2O7+5%B2O3/Al2O3, there is a qualitative change in the catalyst activity in CH dimerization. This allows us to assume that the simultaneous presence of B2O3 and Re2O7 oxides in the catalyst composition causes a certain synergy effect. Besides, the addition of Re2O7 to 5%B2O3/Al2O3 leads not only to the reaction acceleration, but also to the increase in the 1−CC selectivity. It becomes obvious that the Re2O7 additive to the B2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is responsible for the qualitatively new active sites that promote CH participation in the bicyclic hydrocarbon formation. This action of Re2O7 can be explained likely by the rhenium ability to form π-complexes with olefin molecules. The π-complex formation of CH molecules with rhenium atoms is presumably the reason behind the increase in the rate of CH dimerization on the catalyst containing Re2O7 together with B2O3. The π-complexation of CH with Re atoms leads to increasing CH concentration on the catalyst surface that in turn results in an increase in the reaction rate. At the same time, CH chemisorption on Re providing conditions for the double bond of CH to be located close to the catalyst surface increases additionally the probability of interaction of CH involved in the surface π-complex formation with a cyclic carbocation generated on Brønsted acid sites. It can be assumed that electrophilic substitution of hydrogen in the CH molecule occurs namely in the coordination sphere of rhenium atoms, which leads eventually to the 1−CC formation: In order to choose more optimal reaction conditions for the CH conversion into 1−CC over 12 %Re2O7+5%B2O3/Al2O3, tests at different temperatures were carried out (Fig. 3 ). The data obtained show that the temperature increase from 20 to 82°C in 2-h runs leads to the about twice increase in the yield of 1−CC. It was also found that the increase in the reaction temperature leads to an insignificant reduction of the selectivity to 1−CC (Fig. 4 ). According to the GC–MS data, the main by-products produced during the reaction are tricyclic hydrocarbons such as 1,2-dicyclohexylcyclohexene, 1,4-dicyclohexylcyclohexene, 3,6-dicyclohexylcyclohexene: It is obvious that the decrease in the reaction temperature should lead to the suppression of these by-products formation. Indeed, if the process is carried out at 20–40 °C, the selectivity for 1−CC is close to 100 %. The Arrhenius dependence was plotted in Fig. 5 with the use of the data of Fig. 3. We used the average rate of the 1−CC formation during the starting period of the reaction, about 0.2 h from the reaction beginning, as the quantitative parameter of the catalyst activity in CH dimerization. The activation energy for CH dimerization calculated from the Arrhenius plot appeared to be 18 kJ/mol. Such a low value of the activation energy indicates that the limiting stage of the reaction is apparently either the diffusion of CH from the solution to the catalyst or chemisorption of CH on the surface resulting in the formation of π-complexes of CH with Re atoms. Noteworthy, all the kinetic data obtained can be approximated by the kinetic equation of the first order: Ct = C eq * (1 - exp(-kt)), Where Ct, Ceq are the current and equilibrium concentrations of 1−CC in the solution, k is the rate constant, t is the reaction time. The values of the rate constant and the 1−CC equilibrium concentration for each series of experiments were calculated using the least squares method. All kinetic curves given in this paper are plotted according to the mentioned equation. In this case, the standard deviation of the calculated concentrations of 1−CC from the same experimental values does not exceed 2.3 %. An illustration of the fact that the kinetics of the studied reaction fits the first-order reaction is Fig. S1 that demonstrates the rather good linear dependence of ln[CH] on the reaction time for the runs carried out over the 12 %Re2O7+5%B2O3/Al2O3 catalyst at 80°C. In this case, k =0.398 h−1 and Ceq = 96 %, the latter is considered as the highest probable conversion of CH to 1−CC. The first-order of CH dimerization allows us to suppose the limiting stage of the reaction to be likely the formation of π-complexes of CH with rhenium. The absence of the denominator in the kinetic equation indicates that the reaction is not inhibited by adsorption of the product formed. This fact allows us to conclude that the concentration of 1−CC on the surface is rather low, which can be caused by the fast desorption of 1−CC from the catalyst surface into the solution. As shown in [9,10], the catalyst Re2O7+B2O3/Al2O3 exhibits the rather high activity in alkene metathesis. However, at present we failed to find any publications devoted to CH transformations over metathesis catalysts where the formation of CH metathesis products is observed, in particular cyclododecadiene. The 1H NMR analysis of the products (SI, Figs. S3, S4) showed that there is a small signal in the region of 5.5 ppm that can be attributed to protons associated with carbon atoms located in a macrocycle containing double bonds. This fact can be considered as an evidence of cyclododecadiene formation in our conditions but in small amounts. The data presented above demonstrate that there is a direct connection between the catalyst activity in CH dimerization and the acidic properties of the catalyst. In order to improve the performance of the catalyst Re2O7+B2O3/Al2O3, it was decided to increase two times the content of B2O3 in the catalyst composition. At the same time, to maintain the CH : B2O3 ratio, we increased accordingly the concentration of CH in the initial heptane solution from 10 to 30 %. The results of the runs carried out over the 12 %Re2O7+10 %B2O3/Al2O3 catalyst in these modified conditions are shown in Fig. 6 . It can be noticed that the yield of 1−CC on the modified catalyst in the chosen conditions (T = 75°C) reaches about 94 %, while the selectivity to 1−CC in all experiments is close to 100 %. Thus, a conclusion can be drawn that a simultaneous increase in both the content of B2O3 in the catalyst composition and CH concentration in the initial solution leads to a positive effect on the catalyst performance in the synthesis of 1−CC. However, this phenomenon is appeared mainly at the initial stage of the reaction. Indeed, if the reaction is carried out for 2 and 4 h on the 12 %Re2O7+10 %B2O3/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 1), the yield of 1−CC reaches about 50 % and 75 %, respectively, while in the reaction over the modified catalyst (Fig. 6), the same yields are somewhat higher and approach 55 % and 88 %, respectively. This result points to the increase in the reaction rate, which is not so remarkable as it could be expected. If we consider the kinetic dependence obtained for the latter catalyst, it can also fit to the equation of the first order reaction mentioned above (SI, Fig. S6). In this case, the rate constant and equilibrium concentration of 1−CC involved in the equation are equal to 0.425 h−1 and 95 %, respectively. As shown by our measurements of ammonia TPD, the acidic properties of the catalyst due to the additional amount of B2O3 change slightly (SI, Fig. 7), and this change in the catalyst acidity cannot lead to the remarkable increase in the reaction rate. Noteworthy, not only the yield of 1−CC but also the selectivity to this product increase. It is probably the π-complexation of CH with rhenium that reduces the tricyclic hydrocarbons formation and directs the reaction to the 1−CC formation. The dependence of the process on the presence of B2O3 and Re2O7 in the catalyst allows us to consider the Re2O7+B2O3/Al2O3 catalyst as a bifunctional system, however the nature of B2O3 and Re2O7 actions in the conversion of CH to 1−CC is fundamentally different. Indeed, whereas B2O3 is an acidic component responsible for the generation of cyclohexyl carbocations, Re2O7 creates active centers for π-chemisorption of CH molecules and favors their interaction with cyclohexyl cations followed by the formation of the target product. The molar ratio Re2O7 : B2O3 : Al2O3 = 1 : 5.4 : 37 in the catalyst 12 %Re2O7+10 %B2O3/Al2O3 can be considered as the value close to the optimal ratio for the selective formation of 1−CC. In addition, this catalyst can be easily regenerated in the air flow at 500°C for 1 h. Such regeneration can be repeated more than 10 times without any loss of the initial activity. 4 Conclusions Thus, the results of our studies demonstrate that the heterogeneous 2%Re2O7-10 %B2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is able to transform CH to 1−CC with the yield of about 95 % and selectivity close to 100 %, herewith the process is carried out under rather mild conditions. According to our data, CH dimerization does not proceed through olefin metathesis, but is the alkylation of a CH molecule by another one CC molecule, which was previously transformed at the Brønsted acid center of the catalyst into the cyclic carbocation. The research allows us to consider the formation of the CH dimerization product to have a bifunctional mechanism due to the presence of both acidic and metallic active centers in the catalyst. The acidic function is provided by alumina and boron oxide, while the metallic function is delivered by rhenium, which is present in the catalyst as rhenium oxide. The role of rhenium is related with a formation of the surface π-complexes with CH molecules. The plane coordination of the cyclohexene molecule in the π-complex should facilitate its interaction with the cyclohexyl carbocation. The main contribution to the acidic properties of the catalyst is related with boron oxide. Our investigations lead to the conclusion that there is an optimal ratio in the mole fraction of alumina, boron and rhenium oxides, which are the main components of the heterogeneous catalyst for CH dimerization. So, for the 12% Re2O7+10 % Re2O7+10 %B2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, which demonstrates the highest activity in this reaction, the molar Re2O7:B2O3:Al2O3 ratio is about 1 : 5.4 : 37. It must be noted that the highest efficiency in CH dimerization for the catalyst is shown when the process is carried at the temperature of only 75°C. In our opinion, the low temperature is favorable for the reduction of the yield of tricyclic hydrocarbons, which are the main by-products in this reaction.
