RAJADURAI,* J. J. CARBERRY,* B. LL? AND C. B. ALCOCKt *Laboratory of Catalysis, Department of Chemical Engineering, and ?Center for Sensor Materials, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556 Received March 1, 1990; revised November 6, 1990 The catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide on superconducting La2 .,SrxCuO4_a systems has been studied in the temperature range 373 to 573 K. These solid oxide solutions are found to show high catalytic activity for oxidation (carbon monoxide oxidation) which is comparable to that of a highly dispersed 0.5% Pt/alumina fume abatement catalyst. The kinetics of CO oxidation on these solid oxide solutions conforms to the same Langmuir-Hinshelwood model as that of the Pt/alumina catalyst. The catalytic activity which was studied as a function of Sr concentration (x) in these solid oxide solutions shows a \"volcano\" behavior with a maximum activity at x - 0.4. The variation of catalytic activity is compared and found to be concomitant with that of the variation of the electri- cal conductivity, lattice parameter, and oxygen vacancy concentration on the K2NiF4-type La2_xSt~vCuO4 6 lattice and the thermodynamic activity of SrO. 1991 Academic Press, Inc. INTRODUCTION Among technological problems that re- quire attention today are the chemical con- version of pollutants into innocuous gases, of coal into gas, of water into hydrogen and oxygen, and of air and water into fertilizers. As a consequence of the increased aware- ness of air pollution problems in developing countries, catalytic oxidation of CO has been intensely studied for the past few dec- ades (1-6). Supported noble metal catalysts have been the standard and the most widely used catalysts for CO oxidation reaction (7, 8). Nevertheless, the high cost of the noble metals has encouraged the development of oxides, spinels, perovskites, and alloys of transition metals as potential catalysts for pollution abatement processes. Though several substitutes had been reported for Pt, the noble metal catalysts have not yet been replaced successfully (9-11), save for our recent report, which sets forth the dis- covery of La, St, and Cr solid oxide solu- tions which rival Pt in CO oxidation and reveal provocative activity in olefin hydro- genation (1). 0021-9517/91 $3.00 Copyright 1991 by Academic Press, Inc. All rights of reproduction in any form reserved, Insofar as these formulations are of the superconducting class, it would follow that \"normal\" conductivity would be manifest at temperatures typical of catalytic activity. Inspired by the established teaching that ca- talysis, in the large, is often associated with electron exchange twixt the solid catalyst and reactant(s), we deemed it appropriate that solid oxide solutions of the supercon- ducting category be further evaluated as catalyst candidates which might rival con- ventional (metal) conductors. In the present program the catalytic behavior of a series of solid oxide solutions of La, Sr, and Cu has been studied. La2-xSrxCuO4-8 is a KzNiF4-type solid oxide solution characterized by the inter- growth of perovskite and sodium chloride type layers illustrated in Fig. 1. The high electronic conductivity of these compounds is due to the ability of copper to take differ- ent coordinations as well as the formation of mixed valence states. The formation of solid oxide solutions with alkaline earth metal oxides in a wide range (0 < x < 1 in the case of SrO) is a significant property of these compounds. In this article we discuss 582 CATALYTIC OXIDATION OF CARBON MONOXIDE 583 !! La O Cu N --- NaCI type layer, P --. Perovskite layer FIa. 1. KzNiF4-type structure for La2CuO4 solid ox- ide solution. the role that these K2NiF4-type La2-x SrxCuO4_~ oxides (superconductors at low temperatures) might exhibit as catalysts. And, logically, said catalytic activity should be explored in terms of the conduc- tivity of these formulations. PREPARATION OF THE CATALYST Solid oxide solutions of La2-xSrxCuO4-8 (0 < x < 1) were prepared by the conven- tional ceramic technique. The constituents were thoroughly mixed in the proper ratio and pellets were prepared by pressing these mixtures. Each pellet was sintered in an alumina crucible under air for 12 hr at 1323 K. Cycles of grinding, pelletizing, and heat- ing were repeated three times on each sam- ple to ensure complete reaction. The pellets were cooled to 873 K in air inside the fur- nace and then cooled to room temperature outside the furnace. X-ray diffraction, SEM, and EDX showed that each sample was a homogeneous single phase. All the component oxides used were 99.99% Pura- tronic specialty products from AESAR (Johnson Matthey). A uniform range of mesh sizes of powder (the sieve fraction be- tween 10 and 35 ~zm) were used for the cata- lytic studies. The surface area of the solid solutions was measured by the BET N2 physical adsorption technique and found to be typically -<0.4 mZ/g. EXPERIMENTAL Temperature-programmed catalytic stud- ies were carried out in the Notre Dame multifunctional in situ catalyst character- ization unit (12). Tests were made with a fixed feed concentration of the gas mixture (1% CO in oxygen) through a fixed amount of powdered catalyst (0.25 g) to maintain constant contact time. The conversion of CO was determined as a function of tem- perature while the catalyst was program- mably heated (2 min). The effluent from the gradientless recycling reactor was sam- pled using a zero volume sampling valve at different time intervals and the sample was analyzed by means of a gas liquid chro- matograph interphased with an automatic integrator. Independent thermogravimetric analyses were conducted with a Cahn TGA 113 sys- tem under controlled atmosphere to estab- lish the value of ~ (deviation from stoichi- ometry) for each sample. The details of the measurements are available elsewhere (13, 14). A known amount of the sample pellet (< 100 mg) was mounted on a platinum cru- cible so that it made contact only with the thin edge of the crucible. Each sample was reduced under a hydrogen and argon gas mixture after equilibration with a known oxygen partial pressure. No interaction be- tween the sample and Pt was observed in our experimental conditions. The variation of the oxygen content in the solid oxide so- lutions was determined from 823 to 1323 K under an oxygen partial pressure from 105 (pure oxygen) to 6.6 Pa. Blank experiments were carried out with predried alumina powder in the same crucible before and af- ter the investigation of the sample to check the effects of temperature and different gas mixtures on the buoyancy. MKS mass con- 584 RAJADURAI ET AL, trollers were used to control the flowing gas mixtures. Oxygen partial pressures were monitored with a YzO3-stabilized ZrO2 cell placed in a furnace which was upstream from the microbalance. The thermodynamic activity of SrO of these solid solutions was studied with a solid state electrochemical technique using calcium fluoride single crystal as the elec- trolyte. A typical SrO concentration cell was assembled as follows: 02, PtlSrO + SrFzlCaFzlLaz_xSrxCuO4_~ + SrFzIPt,O2. Extra dry grade oxygen was passed through this electrochemical cell to establish the ox- ygen potential of the atmosphere. The over- all composition of each electrode was made from equimolar amounts of the respective components. The electrodes were prepared by the conventional method, i.e., the solid solutions were synthesized first by sintering pellets of appropriate mixtures of the com- ponent oxides at 1323 K, then the electrode pellets were prepared from these com- pounds. The emf measurements were car- fled out in several cycles of increasing and decreasing temperatures from 900 to 1200 K. The thermodynamic activity of SrO was calculated using the Nernst equation (13, 14). The time to reach a steady emf was about 4-24 hr. The achievement of equilib- rium emf values in each cell was assured by temporarily polarizing the cell with an ex- ternal battery; the emf returned to the origi- nal values within +1.5 mV in a period of time after the polarization ceased depend- ing on the experimental condition. Both electrode and electrolyte were checked by x-ray diffraction before and after emf mea- surements and no significant reaction was found. RESULTS AND DIscussION Various combinations of the solid oxide solutions of La, Sr, and Cu of the formula La2-xSG-CuO4-~ (0 < x < 1) were prepared and the kinetics of the catalytic oxidation of CO on these solid solutions were studied. 1 O0 80 8 ~ 60 g 40 0 20 0 , 200 300 400 b ' ' (~0 Temperature (K) FIG. 2. Representative LOT curves for solid oxide solutions (a) Sr = 0, (b) Sr = 0.1, (c) Sr = 1.0, and (d) Pt/alumina catalyst. (Note: these samples were free of contact with Pt.) The kinetics of CO oxidation on these solid solutions follow the Langmuir- Hinshelwood model as in the case of sup- ported noble metal catalyst (Pt/alumina). The \"light-off\" temperature curve (% CO conversion versus temperature) for the solid oxide solutions is compared with that of the Pt/alumina catalyst to show the simi- larity in the CO oxidation behavior in Fig. 2. The LOT results provide support for the Pt-like oxidation behavior of the solid solu- tions. However, the LOT is higher for the solid oxide solutions than for the Pt cata- lyst, but the oxides do not sinter signifi- cantly. Sintering is known to decrease the activity of the Pt catalyst. The catalytic ac- tivity, as measured by the percentage con- version at a constant temperature (475 K) and at a fixed contact time for a constant amount of catalyst (0.25 g), of the solid ox- ide solutions of Laz-xSrxCuO4-8 versus Sr concentration (x) is given in Fig. 3. The cat- alytic activities of these solid oxide solu- tions are compared with that of the compo- nent individual oxides CuO, SrO, and La203. The solid oxide solutions show sig- nificant differences in catalytic activity from that of the individual oxides.

Percentage conversion of CO as a function of Sr concentration in La2_xSrxCuO4_~ at 475 K. \"volcano\" plot of Fig. 3 reveals three areas of catalytic activity as a result of increasing Sr2+ in the place of a La3+ in the La2CuO4 matrix: (a) a sharp increase of activity caused by the replacement of La3by Srz+ with (0 < x < 0.4), (b) a sharp fall in activity with further increase in Sr2+ substitution (0.4 < x < 0.6), (c) increasing or constant activity in the region x > 0.6. The replacement of La3+ by Sr2+ in the sublattice of K2NiF4-type structure of La2 CuO4 leads to several possibilities for the charge balance and defect formation in the copper cation sublattice and in the oxygen anion sublattice. Oxygen vacancy creation by Sr2substitution in the KzNiF4 lattice is represented by Kroger-Vink notation as follows: t tt SrO ---> Sri.a + Oo + 1/2 Vo. (1) The oxygen defects formed in the K2NiF4- type oxide lattice lead to an increase in the lattice parameter due to the displacement of the oxygen atoms from their ideal position, which is sufficient to produce structural dis- tortion in the K2NiF4 lattice. The variation of the lattice parameter as a function of Sr concentration in the solid oxide solutions (Fig. 4) clearly shows the structural distor- tion in the K2NiF4 lattice (15). Nguyen et al. characterized three similar structural domains in the solid oxide solutions of La, Sr, and Cu: orthorhombic compounds with La2CuO4 structure for 0 < x < 0. l, tetrago- nal oxides similar to LaSrCuO4 for 0.1 < x < 1, and several other superstructures derived from the tetragonal cell for 1 < x < 1.34. They also reported that the com- pounds corresponding to 0 < x < 1 differ from the other oxides by the presence of Cu with two oxidation states, +2 and +3 ( 5): SrO + Cucu--> Sr~, + Oo + Cu~u. (2) Thus, obviously two opposite effects which are competitive could be seen in the selid oxide solutions by the substitution of Sr2+ for La3+. For small values of x the oxygen vacancies formed at low oxygen pressures are randomly distributed on the oxygen sublattice to preserve the stoichiometric structure La2CuO4, but these are filled with the accompanying for- mation of positive holes at 1 atm oxygen pressure. At higher values of x these oxy- gen vacancies are probably not completely filled at this oxygen pressure and are or- dered or associated with positive holes. 13.3 ;o 13.2 13.1 _u 13.0 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.'/0 1.2 x in La2_xSrxCu04.6 Fro. 4.

The overall effect of incorporation of Sr2+ in the La3+ position is thus represented as SrO +zCucu~SrLa+ Oo+zCu''Cu + (1 - z)/2 Vo. (3) Further increase in x leads to the formation of microphases favoring Cu2+ with smaller coordination. Some results of the variation of oxygen vacancy (8) as a function of Sr2+ concentration studied by thermogravi- metric analysis are given in Fig. 5. Line c in Fig. 5 shows a linear dependence of 8 with x which corresponds to the nom- inal stoichiometric composition La32+x 8~2+ g-,, 2+t~2- ~u ,Jm-x/2. Lines a and b show devia- tion from this oxygen stoichiometry at dif- ferent temperatures. A slow increase in was observed with Sr concentration in the range 0 < x < 0.4, while a linear depen- dency was obtained for values of x larger than 0.4. Routbort et al. observed a de- crease in the oxygen diffusion coefficient with increasing Sr addition in these solid solutions, contrary to the expectation that the diffusion coefficient should increase with increasing vacancy concentration caused by the addition of Sr2(16). They explained the observed deviation by the or- dering of the oxygen vacancies by binding to Sr clusters at a higher Sr concentration. The initial increase in the oxygen diffusion coefficient with Sr addition could be due to the high mobility of oxygen defects in the dilute solid solutions of Sr, whereas the de- crease in the diffusion coefficient after x = 0.4 may be due to the low oxygen mobility as a result of ordering of defects in the solid oxide solutions. The variation of thermodynamic activity of SrO (asro) as a function of Sr concentra- tion in these solid oxide solutions is shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that asro increases rapidly with x in the range 0 < x < 0.6 and then decreases slowly with further increase of x (0.6 < x < 1.0). This dependence ap- proximately parallels the catalytic activity for CO oxidation. Meenakshisundaram et al. (17) have re- ported such a volcano plot for CO oxidation on ZnMn204 wherein a small addition of Co2increases the catalytic activity by pro- viding a highly active Co2in an octahedral position as these sites are electronically iso- lated, so that there is a high electron avail- ability for the catalytic reaction. Increase in Co2+ concentration, however, causes elec- tron delocalization and hence the absorp- tion of CO as COis difficult.

Variation of electrical conductivity as a func- tion of Sr concentration in La2_xSrxCuO4-~. increase may be due to the increase in Co2+ sites, which also changes the mode of ad- sorption of CO as a carbonate species. In our case, an increase in Sr at small values ofx creates more isolated oxygen defects as well as oxidation of Cu2+ to Cu3+. The reac- tivity of Cu3+ could be more than Cu2+ since it has the d8 electronic configuration which is less stable than the d9 configura- tion in the Cu2+ system. It was also known that the chemisorption for catalytic trans- formation (reactivity) is proportional to the percentage \"d\" character in the transition metal series, which is actually a measure of the metallic bond strength. Our observation shows that Cu2+ is a very active phase for the carbon monoxide oxidation. Also, none of the solid solutions is more active than CuO. It is therefore possible that the pres- ence of Cu2+ as well as the postulated Cu3+ accounts for catalytic activity of the solid solutions. It is also interesting to note that the presence of maximum Cu3+ at the Sr concentration 0.33 was observed by Nguyen et al. in these solid solutions (18). Nguyen et al. reported that a progressive evolution of the conductivity (of samples quenched from 1273 K in air) from a semi- conductor to a semimetallic behavior was obtained as Sr concentration was in- creased. The conductivity of these solid so- lutions at 475 K is plotted as a function of Sr concentration (data obtained from Nguyen et al. (18)) in Fig. 7. Similar vol- cano behavior is seen in the conductivity of the solid solutions. The formation of Cu3+ was deduced by these authors from the Seebeck coefficient, magnetic susceptibil- ity, and conductivity measurements. The increase in the metallic nature of the solid solution may increase adsorption of the precursor reactive species. Thus when the conductivity is maximum we get the maxi- mum catalytic activity and the catalytic ac- tivity decreases as the conductivity de- creases. At the higher concentration of Sr it is possible that the SrZ+-positive hole as- sociation reduces the concentration of cata- lytic active sites involving oxygen vacan- cies. Vickerman et al. observed a similar volcano effect for the oxychlorination reac- tion in the solid solutions of MgAI204 while adding Cu (19-21). They compared the trend of the catalytic activity with the con- ductivity of the solid solutions and con- cluded that the initial increase in the cata- lytic activity is due to the formation of isolated sites involving Cu pairs in the di- TABLE 1 Activity of the Oxidation Catalysts for CO Oxidation Catalyst La/(La + Sr) Activity (Temperature at CO conversion, %) 25% 50% 75% CtlSrO2 0 197 227 242 LaSrCuO4_~ 0.5 187 212 252 Lal.6Sr0.4CuO4_e 0.8 172 192 202 Lal.sSr0.zCuO4-e 0.9 192 202 227 Lal.9Sr0.1CuO4-8 0.95 177 201 212 La2Ctl04 1.0 197 240 257 CuO -- 127 146 159 La203 -- 137 192 227 SrO -- 197 244 252 Note.

Vickerman et al. (20, 21) reported a similar trend in nitrous oxide decomposition in a series of solid solutions of c~-CrxAl2-xO3 and a hydrogen-deuterium exchange reaction in a solid solution of MgAI2 xCr.,O4. Cimino and co-workers (22, 23) observed a similar effect for the solid oxide solutions for a variety of reactions. They also correlated the conduction behav- ior with the activity in the region \"a\" due to electronically isolated centers. The ac- tivity fall in the region \"b\" may be a conse- quence of charge transfer between these sites in the bulk (or polaron hopping). The possibility of charge transfer to an adsorb- ing molecule is thus reduced. The behavior in the region \"c\" was thought to be due to the generation of new electron exchange coupled sites. Such volcano behavior in the catalytic systems was predicted in catalysis by Saba- tier, due to the need for the optimum reac- tant-solid interaction for the higher reactiv- ity (24). A weak bond does not allow strong adsorption and the strong bond does not lead to desorption of the product. In the case of formic acid decomposition on metals, Boudart has displayed this volcano behavior where said activity is related to the activity as a function of heat of forma- tion (25), which is a measure of metal chemisorptive bond strength. CONCLUSIONS The solid oxide solutions of Sr, La, and Cu are quite active catalysts for the oxida- tion of CO in the temperature range for the pollution abatement studies. The maximum activity with the optimum concentration of Sr in these solid solutions may be due to the formation of active centers which facilitate adsorption, reaction, and desorption in the heterogeneous catalyzed CO oxidation re- action. With the cited evidence from the conductivity, lattice parameter variation, oxygen defect concentration, and strontium oxide activity concomitant with the cata- lytic oxidation reaction, we conclude that the initial rise in the activity is due to posi- tive hole (Cu3+) formation which may pro- vide a favorable environment for the ad- sorption of CO and 02 in the CO oxidation reaction. The subsequent decrease in cata- lytic activity is due to the formation of or- dered oxygen vacancies which also reduce the mobility of the positive holes and hence the conductivity. Additional studies are, of course, war- ranted, in particular, selective chemisorp- tion and adsorption heat measurements as a function of Sr composition in these quite provocative solid oxide solutions, which promise not only activity but selectivity be- havior to rival traditional metals and their alloys. ACKNOWLEDGMENT J. J. C. and S. R. are indebted to the Mobil Oil and Exxon Education Foundation for support of our catal- ysis studies. Note added in proof. Since this paper was written, some new evidence, obtained by neutron diffraction (J. D. Jorgensen, Private Communication), suggests that phase separation can occur in the composition range x = 0.2-0.5. This is different from the less-sensi- tive X-ray data obtained in the present study which confirmed published X-ray data suggesting complete miscibility (26-28). It now appears that the presence or absence of immiscibility depends on the method of preparation, most significantly on the sintering cycle both with respect to rate of heating and to the final temperature achieved. The procedure used in this study although appearing to be satisfactory according to the present state of knowledge, will be submitted to examination by neutron diffraction analysis in the near future.

Carberry ∗ B. Li † C.B. Alcock † ∗ Laboratory of Catalysis, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556, USA † Center for Sensor Materials, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556, USA The catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide on superconducting La2−x Sr x CuO4−δ systems has been studied in the temperature range 373 to 573 K. These solid oxide solutions are found to show high catalytic activity for oxidation (carbon monoxide oxidation) which is comparable to that of a highly dispersed 0.5% Pt/alumina fume abatement catalyst. The kinetics of CO oxidation on these solid oxide solutions conforms to the same Langmuir-Hinshelwood model as that of the Pt/alumina catalyst. The catalytic activity which was studied as a function of Sr concentration (x) in these solid oxide solutions shows a “volcano” behavior with a maximum activity at x = 0.4. The variation of catalytic activity is compared and found to be concomitant with that of the variation of the electrical conductivity, lattice parameter, and oxygen vacancy concentration on the K2NiF4-type La2−x Sr x CuO4−δ lattice and the thermodynamic activity of SrO.
