A Novel Reduction Method for Ni/γ -Al 2 O 3 Catalyst by a High Frequency Cold Plasma Jet at Atmospheric Pressure LIU Gaihuan, CHU Wei , LONG Huali, DAI Xiaoyan, YIN Yongxiang* Department of Chemical Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, China Abstract: The Ni/γ -Al 2 O 3 catalyst was reduced by a high frequency cold plasma jet at atmospheric pressure. The performance of the catalyst for carbon dioxide reforming of methane was investigated. The process of catalyst reduction with plasma was quick and simple and was completed in only 10 min, giving activity and selectivity higher than those of the catalyst prepared by the conventional method. At the CH 4 /CO 2 molar ratio of 4/6 and the reaction temperature of 850ºC, the methane conversion and CO 2 conversion reached up to 95.77% and 75.65%, respectively, and a hydrogen selectivity of 100% and a CO selectivity of 94.79% were obtained over the novel cata- lyst reduced by plasma. The novel catalyst exhibited good stability during a reaction test for 36 h. XRD characterization showed that only a metallic nickel phase and γ -alumina existed in the catalyst reduced by plasma, and the NiAl 2 O 4 phase and other nickel oxides were not detected. The nickel particle size of the catalyst was smaller than that of the conventional catalyst. An enhanced dispersion was achieved with the plasma reduction. Key Words: nickel; alumina; supported catalyst; high frequency cold plasma jet; reduction; methane; carbon dioxide; reforming A great effort has been made to investigate the catalysts for carbon dioxide reforming of methane. Among the catalysts investigated, nickel-based catalysts are more popular because of their high activity and low cost. Therefore, numerous stud- ies have focused on the improvement of nickel-based catalysts [1–7], e.g., the addition of promoters [1–5], modification or change of the support [6,7], and changes in preparation condi- tions [4]. In principle, the thermal effect and the chemical effect that exist in a plasma can effectively promote the interaction of the active component and the support. The application of a plasma in the preparation of a nickel-based catalyst can greatly improve the catalyst performance [8–10]. In the pre- vious studies of plasma-assisted preparation of catalysts [8–14], Chu et al. reported better catalytic performances for the plasma-enhanced Fischer–Tropsch cobalt catalyst [11] and for the promoted methane partial oxidation nickel catalyst [12]. Liu et al. demonstrated several significant promoting effects of plasma-enhanced catalysts [9,10,13,14] in methane combustion [13] and other reactions. In these cases, there are some disadvantages, e.g., the reduction is incomplete. How- ever, a high frequency cold plasma jet with features of a higher temperature, proper electron density, and electron en- ergies, which was employed in our experiments, had a great advantage in the reduction of the catalyst. In this research, the Ni/γ -Al 2 O 3 catalyst was prepared by the impregnation method. The Al 2 O 3 support was impregnated with an aqueous solution of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 . After drying and calci- nation at 550ºC, the sample was divided into two parts; one part was for conventional reduction in pure hydrogen, and the other was for plasma reduction in a mixture of H 2 and Ar. Fig. 1 shows the apparatus for the plasma reduction of the Ni/γ -Al 2 O 3 catalyst. An inside copper electrode was connected to a high voltage supply. The coaxial stainless steel cover served as the ground electrode. A mixture of 20%H 2 /Ar was used as the plasma-forming gas. When 20 kHz AC voltage was applied, the plasma gas was jetted into the catalyst bed. The reduction process was performed for only 10 min. The catalytic performance was investigated at 600–900ºC with a molar ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 of 4/6 and GHSV of 30 L/(g·h). The analysis of products was performed with a GC 7900 gas chromatograph (TCD). The novel Ni/γ -Al 2 O 3 catalyst reduced LIU Gaihuan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2007, 28(7): 582–584 by the plasma was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The conversions of methane and carbon dioxide, and the selectivities for hydrogen and carbon monoxide were calcu- lated by the following formulas: X(CH 4 ) = (F CH4, in − F CH4, out )/F CH4, in X(CO 2 ) = (F CO2, in – F CO2, out )/F CO2, in S(H 2 ) = F H2, out /[2(F CH4, in – F CH4, out )] S(CO) = F CO, out /[(F CH4, in – F CH4, out ) + (F CO2, in – F CO2, out )] where X, S, and F are conversion, selectivity, and gas flow rate, respectively. It was reported that the nickel-based catalyst prepared by the conventional method showed the presence of the NiAl 2 O 4 phase [5]. This species has the structure of a spinel and is difficult to reduce [6]. The XPS measurement by Goula et al. [15] also confirmed this phenomenon. According to the pre- vious reports, the catalyst reduction by a glow discharge plasma is also incomplete, and there is still a Ni 2 O 3 phase or NiAl 2 O 4 phase [8,9]. Because metallic nickel constitutes the main active sites, the existence of Ni 2 O 3 or NiAl 2 O 4 can ad- versely influence the catalytic performance. The catalyst reduction by the high frequency cold plasma jet at atmospheric pressure in our experiment gave obvious improvements. As shown in Fig. 2, only the Ni and γ -Al 2 O 3 phases were identified in the XRD patterns of two typical catalysts. However, the characteristic nickel peaks of the novel Ni/γ -Al 2 O 3 catalyst were much broader than those of the conventional Ni/γ -Al 2 O 3 catalyst, which suggested that the particle size of Ni over the novel catalyst was smaller than that of the conventional catalyst. The particle size of Ni was calculated by the Scherrer formula [13]. The calculation re- sults showed that the Ni size was 6.4 nm for the novel Ni/γ -Al 2 O 3 catalyst, whereas it was 12.3 nm for the conven- tional Ni/γ -Al 2 O 3 catalyst, which confirmed that the particle size of Ni over the plasma-reduced sample was smaller. Thus, an enhanced dispersion had been achieved with the plasma reduction, and therefore, the novel catalyst possessed a higher density of active sites. This can be attributed to the application of the new form of plasma. The performances of the two catalysts were examined with a fixed-bed reactor. The results in Fig. 3 indicate that the novel catalyst exhibited better catalytic performances. On both catalysts, although the conversion of the feed gases in- creased with the temperature varying from 650 to 850ºC, the Fig. 1 Schematic diagram of the apparatus for atmospheric high frequency cold plasma jet Fig. 2 XRD patterns of Ni/γ -Al 2 O 3 catalysts prepared by different reduction methods (1) Conventional, (2) Plasma-reduced Fig. 3 Effect of reaction temperature on the conversion and selectivity over different Ni/γ -Al 2 O 3 catalysts (Reaction conditions: catalyst 200 mg, Ni loading 12%, GHSV = 30 L/(g·h), CH 4 /CO 2 molar ratio = 4/6. PR: plasma-reduced; C: conventional.) LIU Gaihuan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2007, 28(7): 582–584 conversion and yield of the plasma-reduced catalyst were always higher than those of the conventional catalyst. At 850ºC, CH 4 and CO 2 conversions on the novel catalyst re- duced by plasma achieved 95.77% and 75.65%, respectively, which were about 5% higher than those on the conventional catalyst. The selectivities for H 2 and CO were high and were 100% and 94.79%, respectively. In contrast, the conventional catalyst presented selectivities for H 2 and CO of 91.77% and 92.54%, respectively. When the plasma-reduced catalyst was utilized for carbon dioxide reforming of methane, little water was produced in the reaction and the amount of carbon de- posit was also smaller. The stability test for 36 h showed that the plasma-reduced catalyst can maintain its high activity. In conclusion, the application of a high frequency cold plasma jet for the reduction of a Ni/γ -Al 2 O 3 catalyst was an effective attempt. Owing to the better thermal effect and chemical effect of this form of plasma, the reduction was quick, simple, and also complete. The use of a plasma in catalyst reduction greatly enhanced Ni dispersion. This can be a good method for catalyst reduction and activation.
