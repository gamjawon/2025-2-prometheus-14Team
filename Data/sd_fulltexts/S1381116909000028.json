Preparation of zinc catalysts (Zn/PS-IL[X], X =Br−, Cl−, BF4 −, and PF6 −) supported on imidazolium–styrene copolymers, as well as their catalytic use for the solvent-free synthesis of styrene carbonate from CO2 and styrene oxide, are described. Among the catalysts examined, Zn/PS-IL[Br] was proved to be the most efficient. When used in a homogeneous system during the reaction process, Zn/PS-IL[Br] gave a 97.5% yield of product with a TOF value that can be up to about 3800h−1. Due to its immiscibility with ethanol, Zn/PS-IL[Br] can be separated like a heterogeneous catalyst through solvent precipitation, and reused at least three times for the reaction without significant loss of activity. Graphical abstract Keywords Ionic liquid Copolymer Cyclic carbonate 1 Introduction Development of an efficient process for chemical fixation of CO2 has recently drawn much attention. CO2 is not only a greenhouse gas but can also be used as an abundant and non-toxic building block for organic reactions. Direct fixation of CO2 by coupling reaction with epoxide to synthesize cyclic carbonate is one of the most promising routes [1]. Despite extensive studies on this reaction, new investigations are still in progress [2]. Styrene oxide, in comparison with other epoxides such as propylene oxide and ethylene oxide, is more difficult to convert to styrene carbonate due to its less reactive β-carbon atom. This necessitates a long reaction time and high reaction temperature for CO2 cycloaddition with styrene oxide. Homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst systems have been reported for this reaction [3]. In general, heterogeneous catalyst systems such as MgO (Temp.: 150°C, CO2: 8MPa, Time: 15h, TOF: 0.02h−1) [3a], Bu4NBr/SiO2 (Temp.: 150°C, CO2: 8MPa, Time: 8h, TOF: 12h−1) [3b] and Et4NBr/zeolite (Temp.: 120°C, CO2: 0.7MPa, Time: 8h, TOF: 10h−1) [3c] were favorable for product separation, but they suffered from a relatively low activity for the reaction. Very low turnover frequencies (TOFs) were observed for heterogeneous catalysts to achieve a satisfactory yield of product. Homogeneous catalyst systems such as Ni(PPh3)Cl2/PPh3/Zn/Bu4NBr (Temp.: 120°C, CO2: 2.5MPa, Time: 1h, TOF: 2066h−1) [3d] and ZnBr2/Bu4NI (Temp.: 80°C, CO2: 8MPa, Time: 0.5h, TOF: 646h−1) [3e] can afford a much better performance for the reaction. However, one of the major weaknesses of homogeneous catalyst systems was that separating products from catalysts was difficult, particularly when the high boiling point of styrene carbonate is considered. The use of soluble polymer-supported catalysts in chemical reactions has emerged as a promising and viable approach for synthetic chemistry due to the phase-selective solubility of polymer-supported catalysts, which can remarkably facilitate product separation and catalyst recovery [4]. We recently reported the synthesis of ionic liquid-based polymers by copolymerization of ionic liquid, i.e., 1-vinyl-3-butylimidazolium chloride, with styrene, and their use as novel polymer supports to immobilize noble metal catalysts such as Pd nanoparticles [5]. We report herein that ZnBr2 can also be efficiently immobilized on imidazolium–styrene copolymers that were prepared by copolymerization of 1-vinyl-3-butylimidazolium-based ionic liquids with styrene, and that the resulting supported zinc catalysts (Zn/PS-IL[X], X =Br−, Cl−, BF4 −, and PF6 −) were proved to be a type of novel soluble polymer-supported catalyst for the solvent-free synthesis of styrene carbonates from CO2 and styrene oxide. That is, they can be used as a homogeneous catalyst during the reaction process, and can be separated like a heterogeneous catalyst through solvent precipitation. Among the catalysts investigated, Zn/PS-IL[Br] was the most efficient, which can offer a 97.5% product yield with a TOF value that can be up to about 3800h−1. Zn/PS-IL[Br] can be separated through solvent precipitation due to its immiscibility with ethanol, and reused at least three times for the reaction without significant loss of activity. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of 1-vinyl-3-butylimidazolium-based ionic liquids Preparation of 1-vinyl-3-butylimidazolium-based ionic liquid, imidazolium–styrene copolymers and the copolymer-supported zinc catalysts are shown in Scheme 1 . According to the previously reported method [5], 1-vinyl-3-butylimidazolium chloride (denoted as [VBIm]Cl) was first synthesized by the reaction of butyl chloride (1.2mol equivalent) with 1-vinylimidazole at 70°C for 48h under an atmosphere of N2. [VBIm]Cl was recovered as a pale yellow liquid after washing thrice with ethyl acetate and dried in vacuo at 70°C. 1-Vinyl-3-butylimida-zolium bromide (denoted as [VBIm]Br) was synthesized in a similar way except that the reaction was carried out at room temperature for 72h. To prepare 1-vinyl-3-butylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (denoted as [VBIm]BF4), NH4BF4 (1.2mol equivalent) was added to a [VBIm]Cl aqueous solution, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 days. [VBIm]BF4 was separated by CH2Cl2 extraction and washed thrice with distilled water. CH2Cl2 was removed under reduced pressure and the product was recovered as a yellow liquid after drying in vacuo at room temperature. To prepare 1-vinyl-3-butylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (denoted as [VBIm]PF6), NaPF6 (1.2mol equivalent) was added slowly to an aqueous solution of [VBIm]Cl at room temperature. Mixture was stirred for 1 day at room temperature. [VBIm]PF6 was separated with a separating funnel and washed thrice with water. It was dried in vacuo at room temperature to offer the final product as a viscous yellow liquid. 2.2 Preparations of imidazolium–styrene copolymers In a typical preparation of an imidazolium–styrene copolymer, styrene (1mmol, purified by distillation before use) and ionic liquid (0.1 equiv.) were added to a 40-mL ethanol solution in a 100-mL round-bottom flask. After the reaction mixture was degassed using a thaw-and-melt method three times, AIBN (0.05 equiv. of double bond) was added. Reaction was allowed to proceed under reflux condition and an atmosphere of N2 for 24h. At the end of the reaction, the flask was cooled to room temperature. A white precipitate appeared at the bottom of the flask, which was separated by filtration and washed thrice with ethanol. After drying in vacuo at room temperature to remove solvent, the precipitate was ground with a mortar and pestle to afford the imidazolium–styrene copolymer denoted by PS-IL[X] (X =Cl−, Br−, BF4 −, and PF6 −) in the form of white powder. This was further washed with ethanol to remove unbound ionic liquid, and dried in vacuo at room temperature. 2.3 Immobilization of ZnBr2 on imidazolium–styrene copolymers To immobilize ZnBr2 on the imidazolium–styrene copolymer, ethanol (10mL), the imidazolium–styrene copolymer (1.0g) and ZnBr2 (2mmol) were added to a 50-mL round-bottom flask, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24h. The solid was recovered by filtration, washed with ethanol and methanol, and dried in vacuo at room temperature. The imidazolium–styrene copolymer-supported zinc catalysts were denoted by Zn/PS-IL[X] (X =Cl−, Br−, BF4 −, and PF6 −). 2.4 Immobilization of ZnBr2 on ionic liquid-modified silica gel For comparison, an analogous silica gel-supported zinc catalyst, denoted as Zn/SiO2-IL[Cl], was also prepared by immobilization of ZnBr2 on silica gel that was modified by a chloride-containing ionic liquid, i.e., N-3-(-3-triethoxysilylepropyl)-3-methylimidazolium chloride, using a similar method reported previously [6]. 2.5 Reaction and analysis In a typical experiment, styrene oxide (2mmol) and a certain amount of catalyst were charged successively into a 15-mL glass reactor (Fig. 4) to give a homogeneous solution. The glass reactor was mounted in a self-made autoclave equipped with a magnetic stirrer. CO2 of the desired pressure was introduced through a plunger pump, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 80–140°C. At the end of the reaction, the reactor was cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture in the glass reactor was a white solid. Ten milliliters of ethanol was added into the glass reactor, resulting in the formation of a suspension due to the immiscibility of Zn/PS-IL[X] (X =Cl−, BF4 −, and PF6 −) with ethanol. After centrifugation of the suspension at 12,000rpm for 10min, the catalyst was precipitated and a clear ethanol solution obtained. The ethanol phase was analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector using toluene as internal standard (Shimadzu DC-2014, ULBON HR-52 capillary column 25mm×0.32mm). The recovered catalyst was dried in vacuo at room temperature and reused as described above. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of imidazolium–styrene copolymers and their supported zinc catalysts PS-IL[X] and Zn/PS-IL[X] (X =Cl−, BF4 −, and PF6 −) were characterized by inductively coupled plasma (ICP), gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and elemental analysis (Table 1 ). Depending on the ionic liquid used (particularly the anion part of the ionic liquid), the amounts of ionic liquid in the resulting copolymers PS-IL[Cl], PS-IL[Br], PS-IL[BF4] and PS-IL[PF6] were 0.46, 0.47, 0.59 and 0.76mmol/g, respectively, approximately in the order Cl− =Br− <BF4 − <PF6 −. ICP analysis revealed a slightly different order regarding the loading amount of zinc on the imidazolium–styrene copolymers. PS-IL[Cl] gave a higher loading amount of zinc than PS-IL[Br] and PS-IL[BF4], whereas PS-IL[PF6] had the highest one. With regard to the molecular weight of imidazolium–styrene copolymers, GPC analysis revealed a relatively similar distribution of M w and M n. The former was about 4000, the latter about 3400. Dialkylimidazolium zinc tetrahalide complex can be formed from imidazolium halides and zinc halides, and therefore a much higher loading amount of zinc was observed in Zn/SiO2-IL[Cl] [7]. 3.2 CO2 coupling reaction with styrene oxide catalyzed by supported zinc catalysts Catalytic performance of zinc catalysts for CO2 cycloaddition with styrene oxide were investigated at 120°C under a CO2 pressure of 3MPa (Table 2 ). Product yields largely depended on the catalyst type, particularly the anionic part of the ionic liquid in the copolymers, when polymer-supported zinc catalysts were used. The best result was achieved by using Zn/PS-IL[Br], which gave a TOF as high as about 3800h−1 with a product yield of 97.5% (run 1). Zn/PS-IL[Cl] showed a product yield of only 35.0%, which corresponded approximately to a TOF of 1300h−1 (run 2). The nucleophilicity of anion may play an important role in the reaction of CO2 cycloaddition with epoxide in ionic liquids [8]. The observed better catalytic performance of Zn/PS-IL[Br] over Zn/PS-IL[Cl] could possibly be attributed to the stronger nucleophilicity of Br− than that of Cl− under the reaction condition. Ionic liquids containing BF4 − and PF6 − are known for their inferior performances when used as reaction medium in the ZnBr2-catalyzed CO2 cycloaddition with styrene oxide [8]. When Zn/PS-IL[BF4] was employed, lower yield of product (19.5%) and TOF (about 700h−1) were observed as expected (run 3). Zn/PS-IL[PF6] gave a product yield of <1% (run 4). For comparison, CO2 cycloaddition with styrene oxide was also carried out by using the homogeneous catalysts ZnBr2/[VMIm]Br and ZnBr2/[VMIm]Cl as well as the heterogeneous catalyst Zn/SiO2-IL[Cl]. Zn/SiO2-IL[Cl] could be roughly viewed as a silica gel analog of Zn/PS-IL[Cl]. As can be seen, ZnBr2/[VMIm]Br gave a product yield of 86.3% and a TOF of about 3300h−1, which was in the same performance range as other homogeneous catalysts for the reaction, such as ZnCl2/[BMIm]Br (run 5) [3g]. Again, a lower yield of product of 27.1% was obtained in the Cl−-containing ionic liquid [VBIm]Cl due to the weaker nucleophilicity of Cl− than that of Br− (run 6). A product yield of 10.6% was observed for Zn/SiO2-IL[Cl] (run 7). On the basis of the above results, it can be concluded that the use of imidazolium–styrene copolymer as organic support to immobilize ZnBr2 can greatly enhance the catalytic performance of the ZnBr2/ionic liquid system for the CO2 cycloaddition with styrene oxide, offering much higher activity than the silica gel-supported analog (and even the homogeneous counterpart). This may result from the increase in the interfacial area between the catalyst and the substrate. Similar results were observed in our previous study when an imidazolium–styrene copolymer-supported Pd catalyst was used for hydroesterification and hydrogenation reactions [5]. 3.3 Effects of reaction time and temperature on CO2 cycloaddition with styrene oxide catalyzed by Zn/PS-IL[Br] The effects of time and temperature on the reaction were then investigated in view of the fact that Zn/PS-IL[Br] could offer a high yield of product for the CO2 cycloaddition with styrene oxide (Figs. 1 and 2 ). A relatively long reaction time was needed to achieve a high yield of styrene carbonate (Fig. 1). When the reaction was carried out at 120°C at a CO2 pressure of 3MPa using 2mmol styrene oxide and 6.4×10−5 mmol Zn/PS-IL[Br], it took 8h to complete the reaction, resulting in a product yield of 98%. Increasing reaction temperature greatly enhanced the product selectivity, and the highest yield of product was achieved at 120°C (Fig. 2). Further increase in the reaction temperature to 130°C or 140°C led to a slight decrease in product yield. Because the β-carbon atom of styrene oxide is less reactive than that of other epoxides (e.g., propylene oxide, ethylene oxide), styrene oxide is usually more difficult to convert to styrene carbonate, so a relatively long reaction time and high reaction temperature are needed. 3.4 Effect of pressure on CO2 cycloaddition with styrene oxide catalyzed by Zn/PS-IL[Br] CO2 pressure has been known as one of the most important factors affecting the CO2 cycloaddition reaction with epoxide. Depending on the catalyst used and the gas–liquid phase behavior of the reaction system, the optimal yield of cyclic carbonates could be achieved at different pressure ranges, e.g., mild pressure for ZnBr2/[Bmim]Br (1.5MPa) [3g], medium pressure for ZnBr2/n-Bu4NI (8MPa) [3c] and supercritical pressure for [C8-mim]Br (14MPa) [9]. The effect of CO2 pressure on the CO2 cycloaddition with styrene oxide catalyzed by Zn/PS-IL[Br] is illustrated in Fig. 3 . As can be seen, when the reaction was carried out at 120°C under varied CO2 pressures, a CO2 pressure lower than 6MPa was found to be favorable for the reaction, under which yields of product and conversions of styrene fluctuated only in a small scale. This may be attributed to the homogeneous nature of the reaction system that can allow the reaction to proceed smoothly in the liquid phase. Further increasing the CO2 pressure had a negative effect on the reaction. Both yields of product and conversions of styrene decreased correspondingly with the increase in the CO2 pressure. This may result from the phase change of CO2 form a gas to a supercritical fluid, because a part of styrene oxide can dissolve in the supercritical CO2. This would inevitably decrease the amount of the reaction substrate in the liquid phase where the reaction occurs. 3.5 Separation of styrene carbonate and recycling of Zn/PS-IL[Br] Separation of styrene carbonate from homogeneous catalysts when the reaction was carried out in a homogeneous system is difficult because styrene carbonate is solid with a high boiling point, even though a higher catalytic activity can be achieved. The heterogeneous system was favorable for styrene carbonate separation, but suffered from lower activity. The use of Zn/PS-IL[Br] as a soluble polymer catalyst for the CO2 cycloaddition with styrene oxide can simultaneously provide high activity and easy separation of product. Phase changes of the reaction system at different reaction stages are illustrated in Fig. 4 . When the white powder Zn/PS-IL[Br] was mixed with styrene oxide, a homogeneous solution was obtained (a and b). After the termination of the reaction, the reaction mixture was a white solid (c). Addition of ethanol to the post-reaction mixture resulted in the formation of a suspension due to the precipitation of Zn/PS-IL[Br] (d). Zn/PS-IL[Br] was recovered after centrifugation of the suspension at 12,000rpm for 10min (e). Gas chromatographic analysis revealed that styrene carbonate was obtained in high purity from ethanol solution because other by-products were not detected. The reusability of Zn/PS-IL[Br] was also investigated (Fig. 5 ). Zn/PS-IL[Br] exhibited a relatively good performance in the recycling of the reaction, which can be used at least three times without much loss of activity. 4 Conclusions We demonstrated the use of a type of novel zinc catalyst supported on soluble polymers for the solvent-free synthesis of styrene carbonate from CO2 and styrene oxide. The catalysts were prepared by immobilization of ZnB2 on imidazolium–styrene copolymers. When Zn/PS-IL[Br] was used for the reaction, high activity and easy separation of product could be achieved simultaneously. Zn/PS-IL[Br] was reusable for the reaction, suggesting that this kind of catalyst supported on imidazolium–styrene copolymers may have great potential in synthetic chemistry. References [1] (a) P.G.
