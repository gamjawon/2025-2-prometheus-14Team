During SSITKA, the R2 flow is kept at steady state. Ar (Argon) is an inert gas which does not adsorb or react on the catalyst surface. Normalized response, F(t), is the fraction of the coverage of IR-observable species and the concentration of gaseous reactant/product species (Ci) between 0 and their maximum values after reaching a new steady state.

The dynamic reaction behavior (i.e., transient responses) of IR-observable adsorbed species and gaseous products obtained from transient kinetic studies provide valuable kinetic and mechanistic information, namely: the abundance of active intermediates and their reactivity distribution, the chemical structure of IR-observable active and spectator species, the sequence of their formation, and the kinetically significant and rate-determining step under reaction conditions of practical catalysis. We discuss the use of transient response data to elucidate the reaction mechanisms of several gas-solid reactions: CO/H2, CO/H2/C2H4, photocatalytic oxidation of ethanol, and the CO2-amine reaction. The IR coupled with transient kinetic techniques is especially useful for investigating the mechanisms of photocatalytic reactions because both photogenerated electrons and many adsorbed species are IR-active (exhibiting measurable IR bands), and their evolution occurs on a time scale of seconds at ambient temperature. We highlight the key features and limitations of in situ IR with transient kinetics, as well as their significance in catalyst design.

In general, catalyst properties refer to the intrinsic characteristics of a catalyst, including mainly acidity/basicity, redox property, surface area, and the activity of active sites. Active sites consist of specific surface structures of the catalyst. The linkage of the structure-property-performance relationship is crucial for establishing a fundamental understanding of the underlying reaction mechanism(s). An in-depth understanding of reaction mechanisms which delineate the reaction pathway followed by the adsorbed species on the catalyst surface structure could provide a scientific basis for elucidating and manipulating active sites to produce high performance catalysts which eventually give high product yields under optimal reaction conditions. Recognition of the dynamic nature of catalytic reaction process in which the structure of catalytic sites and the concentration (i.e., coverage) of adsorbed species varies with their reaction environment calls for characterization of both the adsorbed species and active sites under working catalytic conditions [3,4]. It is highly challenging to directly observe the evolution (i.e., dynamics) of adsorbed species as well as the surface and bulk structure of the catalyst. Operando spectroscopy which involves several spectroscopic techniques as well as transient kinetic approaches are required for obtaining the needed information to gain an insight into the structure of adsorbed species and active sites as well as their dynamic behaviors at the atomic and molecular levels. The challenge arises from (i) the limited range of applicability of spectroscopic approaches, and (ii) the transient nature (i.e., short lifetime and low surface coverage) of active adsorbed species [5–7]. Active adsorbed species which participate in the catalytic sequence of elementary steps may have a very short lifetime (i.e., residence time) on the active sites, giving a very low surface concentration (i.e., coverage) beyond the detection limit of a spectroscopic method. In situ infrared spectroscopy was found particularly useful in investigating the structure of some of the adsorbed species in CO hydrogenation, hydroformylation (CO/C2H4/H2), CO2-CH4 (dry reforming reaction, NO-CO (catalytic reduction of NO by CO), NO decomposition, photocatalytic oxidation of ethanol, conversion of CO2/methanol to dimethyl carbonate, and the CO2-amine reaction in CO2 capture [1,8]. Some adsorbed species resulting from these reactions exhibit discernable infrared bands and evolve on a time scale of seconds, allowing us to elucidate their structure and their participation in the reaction pathway. In this review, we will discuss how in situ infrared spectroscopy is coupled with transient kinetics to elucidate catalytic reaction mechanisms, including active adsorbed species, active sites, and the rate-determining step of several reactions: methanation, ethylene hydroformylation, photocatalytic oxidation of ethanol, and CO2-amine reaction. We will examine the limitations of transient infrared approaches and provide a perspective on its further development. 2 In situ IR with transient kinetics Figure 1 (a) illustrates the reactor system used in SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetics) and other transient kinetic approach to investigate a hypothetical simplified reaction scheme as shown in Fig. 1(b), which involves a sequence of typical catalytic reaction steps: (i) the adsorption of gaseous reactants, R1 and R2, (ii) the subsequent surface reactions of their adsorbed species, *R1 and *R2, (iii) the surface reactions of adsorbed intermediate, *I1 and *I2, and (iv) their desorption to the final gaseous products, P1, P2, Pn. The reactor system consists of three key components: (i) a manifold to introduce a perturbation to the concentration of the reactant, (ii) an in situ IR cell for observing the responses of adsorbed species, i.e., *R1, *R2, *S, *I1, *I2, *P1, *P2, and (iii) a mass spectrometer to monitor the responses of gaseous reactants (R1and R2) and products (P1, P2, and Pn). The manifold usually consists of pulse- and step-switching valves which allow the introduction of a perturbation in the concentration of reactant in various modes: (i) stopping one of the reactant flow, (ii) switching from one reactant to the other reactant in a mode of step, pulse, and sinusoidal functions, and (iii) a batch reaction of one adsorbed species with other reactants. Carrying out transient kinetic experiments in an in-situ IR cell allows simultaneous observation of the evolution of IR-observable species and their resulting gaseous products to a well-defined perturbation at the input, i.e., the inlet of the reactor. Considerations for the use of in situ IR coupled with transient kinetics for a mechanistic study include the following: (i) the characteristics of catalytic reactions, (ii) the sensitivity of the IR and MS spectrometers, and (iii) the arrangement of catalyst particles in the in-situ IR cell. The catalytic reaction of interests should have a characteristic of producing IR-observable adsorbed species and gaseous products with their evolution rate in the sensitivity range (i.e., the detection limit and time resolution) of an infrared spectrometer and a mass spectrometer, respectively. Thus, the reaction of interest must be tested to find a range of reaction conditions to produce the proper amount of IR- observable species and gaseous products. Further complications arise from the void space (i.e., gas holdup) in an in-situ IR cell and its mode of operation (i.e., transmission IR or DRIFTS (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy)). The transmission IR is only applicable to those IR-transparent samples which were shaped by compression of fine catalyst particles into a thin disc. High pressure compression of catalyst particles could lead to the collapse of pores in catalyst particles and loss of void space between catalyst particles, thus creating diffusion barriers for reactants and products. The DRIFTS mode allows catalyst particles to be loosely packed in a shallow packed bed, giving IR spectra of those species adsorbed on the top layer of the packed bed. The amount of catalyst sample used for either transmission IR or DRIFTS is typically, ca. 30–80 mg, which could give a conversion of less than 5–10% under a flow rate of 100 cm3/min in a selected temperature range for many catalytic systems. The void space and the arrangement of catalyst particles can influence the pattern of how the reactant/product flow contacts those active sites within the catalyst particles. To observe the contacting patterns of reactants/products on the catalyst surface and to account for their effects on the transient responses of reactants/products, an inert gas such as Ar or He (as shown in Fig. 1(c)) must be added with the perturbed reactant [9,10]. For the easy of modeling of transient responses of reactants and products, either back-mixing or differential reactor conditions have been created to approximate a gradient less environment so that all intermediates (both IR and non IR observable species) in the reaction pathway can be approximated as a system of interconnected pools, where each pool contains a specific amount of intermediates with a presumably uniform reactivity [11–13]. Although the in situ IR coupled with transient kinetics, illustrated in Fig. 1, is conceptually straightforward, there are reactions which do not possess characteristics as those discussed in the above considerations, and in this case they might be conveniently studied using two separate reaction systems: (i) an in situ IR system, and (ii) transient kinetic study in a conventional micro-reactor in a packed bed form [14,15]. It is instructive to point out that the concept of transient kinetics follows those of stimuli-responses approaches which have been widely used in scientific and engineering studies to gain an understanding of the dynamic behavior of various processes. This methodology has long been applied to Chemical Reaction Engineering for determining the residence time distribution (RTD) and flow patterns of the reactants/products in flow reactors [16] to electrochemistry for measuring the impedance of an electrochemical device, such as fuel cell and battery [17,18] to rheology for measuring the storage and loss modulus of a polymer, to material sciences for measuring dielectric spectroscopy [19] and to electrical engineering for measuring dynamic behaviors of a circuit [20]. Theoretical model for interpreting the input-output (stimuli-response) relationship usually involves two key elements with their parameters: a continuous well-stirred tank (CSTR) and a valve to control the rate of effluent from the CSTR for RTD in chemical reaction engineering, a capacitor and a resistor for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and dielectric spectroscopy, and a spring and a dashpot for dynamic mechanical analysis and in rheology. The tank, capacitor, and spring correspond to a storage element, while the flow through a valve, resistor, and dashpot correspond to a resistance element [21]. In the SSITKA technique, the pool of intermediates corresponds to a surface storage element; the reactivity (i.e., 1/τ, τ: the average residence time of intermediates) corresponds to a resistance element. 3 Ethylene hydroformylation reaction 3.1 In situ IR coupled with SSITKA The unique feature of the in-situ IR/SSITKA approach is the direct observation of the evolution of the isotope-labelled and non-labelled adsorbed species and their resulting products. To minimize disturbing the chemical environment of adsorbed species and kinetic isotope effects during catalytic reaction, the molecular weight ratio of the isotope-labelled and non-labelled species should be close to one. The concept for combination of SSITKA with spectroscopic approaches was first proposed by Tamaru in 1960s' [3,22]. In 1970's Bennet [13] and in 1980s, Biolen [11], Soong [23], Efstathiou [24], Happel [25,26], Goodwin [12] and Bell [27] and their coworkers, have further developed both experimental SSITKA as well as approaches for modeling and interpretation of SSITKA data. In 1990s, we followed the concept proposed by Tamaru to incorporate SSITKA with in situ IR [1]. A typical SSITKA begins with conducting a reaction in a fixed bed reactor, preferably a differential reactor, under steady state reaction conditions, where the gas flow and feed concentration of reactants as well as the temperature and total pressure are kept constant. A differential reactor operation limits the conversion of the reaction to less than 5–10%, so that the heat and concentration profile effects as well as secondary reactions can be minimized. Upon reaching a steady-state reaction condition, as indicated by the absence of variation in the concentration of products with reaction time (a Ci vs time profile) determined by the mass spectrometer as shown in Fig. 1(c), switching the flow from R1 (a non-isotope labelled reactant) to R1’ (a isotope labelled reactant) by a 4-way “zero” volume chromatographic valve produces a step change (i.e., stimulus or well-defined perturbation) in the concentration of R1 and R1’. R1 shows a sharp drop as a step-down and at the same time R1’ shows a sharp increase. These variations in the concentration of all of gaseous reactants and products are monitored by MS [10]. It is essential to have both response curves of isotope-labelled and non-labelled meeting at 50% of their normalized responses, reflecting one-to-one replacement of the R1 molecules by the R1’ molecules, and indicating the absence of variation in the chemical environment of adsorbed species and sites under the working reaction conditions of the catalyst surface. It takes some time for the isotope-labelled reactant, R1’, molecules to travel through the gaseous lines and void space in the catalyst bed for adsorption and surface reaction steps leading finally to product, P1’ (see Fig. 1c, R1’ and P1’ response curves). Thus, the concentration response of the reactant (R1’) appears first followed by the P1’ response curve which shows a rise, and gradually reaching a steady-state value the same as that of the non-labelled P1 product (no kinetic isotopic effects). The position in time of the R1’ response curve will depend on the kinetics of its adsorption and the kinetics of exchange of the active reaction intermediates (e.g., I′) formed in the reaction path from R1’ reactant to P1’ product (see Fig. 1b) [12]. The P1 response exhibits a gradual decline as all P1-related active adsorbed species travelled through the reaction pathway via the interaction of R1 molecular species as well as their associated adsorbed intermediate species are gradually replaced by the equivalent isotope-labelled species. Note that the concentration profiles in Fig. 1(c) are expressed in a normalized form (F(t) that takes values between 0 and 1) to facilitate the comparison of response curves for various products. An accurately conducted SSITKA experiment should produce a pair of symmetric P1 and P1’ responses crossing each other at F(t) = 0.5. As discussed in the pervious section, it is essential to account for the mass transfer and flow pattern effects. Thus, a small amount of Ar (Argon), less than 2%, is included in either R1 or R1” to follow how all gaseous molecules travel from the injection point (4-way chromatographic valve) through the void space in the catalyst bed and transportation lines to the MS sampling point. The Ar response curve represents the residence time distribution of all of those gaseous reactants travelling from the injection point to the MS without reacting/adsorbing on the catalytic surface. Considering the Argon response curve with respect to the labelled reactant and product response curves allows to eliminate gas flow-pattern effects on the falsification of transient responses of adsorbed species and those of gaseous reactants and products. One of the most direct information that can be obtained from the product transient response curves is the average residence time of intermediates leading to a given product i, according to the following Eq. (1) [12]: (1) τ i = ∫ 0 ∞ 1 − Fi t dt − τ Ar = ∫ 0 ∞ F Ar t − Fi t dt Transient response curve of gaseous reactants/products, F i (t), for the SSITKA experiment is defined by the fraction of the isotopic concentration of gaseous reactant/product (Ci) developed during the SSITKA switch where the isotopic concentration values were obtained between the old and new steady-state under the isotopic gas mixture. For example, in the case of P1 and P1’, F(t) takes values between 1 and 0 and between 0 and 1, respectively. Other mechanistic and kinetic parameters which can be obtained from analysis of the transient response include the reactivity distribution of reaction intermediates and surface coverage of intermediates leading to a specific product [12]. 3.2 13CO-SSITKA studies Considering the CO/C2H4/H2 (ethylene hydroformylation) reaction on Rh/SiO2 catalyst [28], depicted in Scheme 1(a), adsorbed H interacts with adsorbed ethylene to form an adsorbed ethyl species. The adsorbed ethyl could further react with adsorbed hydrogen to produce ethane, or with adsorbed CO/adsorbed hydrogen to form C2H5CHO (propionaldehyde). The formation of ethane and propionaldehyde share adsorbed ethyl, *C2H5, as a common intermediate species. Figure 2 shows typical SSITKA response curves of the CO/H2/C2H4 reaction over Rh/SiO2 with a step gas isotopic concentration switch of the 12CO/Ar flow to the 13CO/Ar flow (keeping the H2 and C2H4 individual flows constant) as a stimulus. In situ IR results show that both adsorbed linear and bridge 12CO-s (-s indicates association with surface atom.) rapidly were replaced by their equivalent linear and bridge 13CO-s [29–31]. Their IR band intensities overlapped with those of gaseous 12CO and 13CO; the responses of IR band intensity profiles for gaseous CO and linear/bridge CO species are overlapped. Fig. 2 shows that the 13CO response curve lagged that of Ar tracer. Close examination of 12CO and 13CO response curves show that (i) the decay of the 12CO curve is faster than the rise 13CO curve, and (ii) they intersect around F(t) = 0.3, suggesting the presence of a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) on the adsorption step of CO and the desorption step of those adsorbed CO species which do not enter the reaction pathway (inactive species). The residence time of the adsorbed CO species can be obtained by integrating the area between the Ar (the reverse Ar curve) and that of 13CO response curve, as shown by Eq. (1). Figure 2 also shows that the transient response curves of gaseous reactants and products proceed in the sequence: (i) Ar leading 13CO, and (ii) 13CO further leading C2H5 13CHO. The lagging time of the C2H5C13HO response, τ C2H5CHO, reflects the mean residence time of all active reaction intermediates from *13CO (adsorbed 13CO) to the final reaction product (C2H5 13CHO) as shown by the sequence of reaction steps (2). If we can consider all the reaction intermediates in the reaction pathway between *CO and *C2H5CHO (adsorbed acyl species) as a single pool, as illustrated in the scheme below, the coverage of the reaction intermediates (*CO and *C2H5CHO) leading to C2H5CHO can be obtained by Eq. (3), where TOF (turnover frequency) is the ratio of the rate of product formation (mols/g/s) to the number of mols of surface Rh per gram of catalyst determined by hydrogen chemisorption. We measured θ i (the total surface coverage of intermediates leading to C2H5CHO as well as its TOF as a function of partial pressures of all three reactants, i.e., CO, H2, C2H4. We found that the CO/H2/C2H4 reaction on Rh/SiO2 follows the LHHW (Langmuir-Hinshelwood Hougen Watson) kinetics with the hydrogenation of adsorbed acyl species as the rate-determining step. Both measured rate data and isotherm of reaction intermediates (i.e. θ i versus Pi (partial pressure of reactants)) which were determined from Eq. (3) fit very well into LHHW kinetics. Mn is known to promote the CO insertion activity on Rh catalysts. It is expected that Mn-Rh/SiO2 exhibits a different kinetics for the product formation than Rh/SiO2. We found through fitting the rate and isotherm data that Mn additives shift the rate-limiting step [28]. Both CO insertion and hydrogenation of *C2H5CO are kinetically significant steps. In other words, there is no rate-determining step in the CO/C2H4/H2 reaction over Mn-Rh/SiO2 catalyst. The kinetics of the reaction on Mn-Rh/SiO2 can be best described by PSSH (pseudo-steady-state-hypothesis) which do not have a hypothetical rate-determining step in the derivation of a kinetic model [32,33]. In addition, both TOF and θ i were enhanced by at least one order of magnitudes by Mn additives. Determination by SSITKA of both dependences of reaction rate and coverage of reaction intermediates on partial pressure of reactants allowed elucidation of kinetically significant steps and the rate-determining step as well as conclusion on accurate kinetic models. The latter is essential for the scaling up of a catalytic process. 3.3 D2-SSITKA studies It is logical to extend the use of SSITKA by conducting a step-gas switch to C2H4/13C2H4 or H2/D2 as opposed to 12CO/13CO (see Section 3.1.1) since hydrogenation steps also dictate the rate and selectivity of the reaction. We focused on the H2/D2 step-gas switch study. Scheme 1(b) shows how D2 (g) enters the reaction pathway that produced the isotopic response curves for the products, C2H6-xDx and C2H5-xCDO over the Rh/SiO2 catalyst [28]. The rate of CO/C2H4/H2 was higher than that of CO/C2H4/D2, manifesting a normal kinetic isotope effect (NKIE). In other words, the rate-determine step involves hydrogen bond formation and/or breaking in producing the final reaction products. Note that step-gas switch and pulse-gas switch can produce the same information via the dynamic responses [31]. Closeness of the responses of C2H6 to that of D2 in our pulsing D2 to CO/H2/C2H4 studies provided the mean residence time of intermediates leading to C2H6-xDx which is very short [28]. Hydrogenation of adsorbed C2H5 (*C2H5) is significantly faster than that of CO insertion and subsequent hydrogenation to *C2H5-xHxCDO, which gave a trailing response. An interesting observation in H2/D2 pulse study is that the Si-OD response curve follows those of *C2H4DCDO and *C2H5CDO, indicating that D in Si-OD participates in the deuteration of *C2H4DCO and *C2H5CO. To confirm that D from Si-OD can be reversely spilled over from SiO2 to Rh sites for deuteration, Rh/SiO2 with Si-OD was prepared by exposing D2-treated Rh/SiO2 followed by hydrogenation of adsorbed D on Rh surface with C2H4. Such a treatment produced Si-OD on Rh/SiO2 as shown in Fig. 3(b). Fig. 3(a) shows that the trailing response of d1-propionaldehyde (C2H5CDO) did follow that of Si-OD on SiO2 in a transient study conducted by exposing Rh/SiO2 with Si-OD to CO/H2/C2H4. The decrease in Si-OD intensity followed the decay of d1-propionaldehyde, indicating the involvement of reversed spillover of D from OD on SiO2 during hydrogenation of C2H5CO to C2H5CDO. The absence of d2- and d3-propionaldehyde (C2H4DCDO and C2H3D2CDO) further confirmed that (i) the D source in d1-propionaldehyde was from Si-OD, and (ii) all adsorbed D on Rh surface had been removed to exclude deuteration of C2H4 to deuterated ethyl, *C2H4D and C2H3D2. These transient responses suggested d1-propionaldehyde formation sites should locate at the interface between Rh particles and SiO2, allowing D from Si-OD to have direct access to adsorbed acyl, C2H5CO, which was produced on the CO insertion site. 3.4 In situ IR coupled with transient kinetics of hydroformylation reaction SSITKA produced a rapid exchange between gaseous and adsorbed CO in both linear and bridge forms which did not allow determination of which type (linear and/or bridge CO) is more reactive toward CO insertion. Thus, we attempted to carry out in situ IR studies at 25 °C by first adsorbing CO as linear and bridge CO on Rh/SiO2 and then admitting C2H4/H2 to the IR reactor cell to initiate hydrogenation and CO insertion according to Scheme 1(a). It was observed that the intensity of the linear CO decreased as the IR intensity of adsorbed propionaldehyde increased along with that of ethane, while bridge CO and gem-dicarbonly species remained unchanged. The results led to a conclusion that the linear CO site is responsible for the CO insertion step shown in Scheme 1(a) and a single reduced Rh site (i.e., Rho), whereas linear CO resided on is the site for CO insertion [2]. It is noted that CO insertion has been shown to proceed by the insertion of CO between metal-C bond of alky metal complex in homogeneous hydroformylation. Further studies using the same approach on oxidized Rh led to an additional conclusion that an oxidized Rh site (i.e., Rh+) is also active for the CO insertion step. The rapid exchange between CO and adsorbed CO (linear and bridge CO) also occurs in the methanation (CO/H2 reaction) over Rh/SiO2 during the SSITKA study [31]. Thus, we attempted to determine the reactivity of linear and bridge CO by switching the reactant flow from CO to H2. Such a step-gas switch allowed us to monitor the response in the IR intensity of linear and bridge CO versus time during which these CO-type species react with H2 to produce methane. The high rate of the decay of linear CO-s compared to that of bridge CO-s suggest that the linear CO site is more reactive toward hydrogenation to CH4 than the bridge CO-s species [29]. This conclusion contrasts with the requirement of an ensemble site for CO dissociation – a key step for methanation on Ni catalysts. The mechanism of methanation on Rh may not be able to extend to that of methanation on Ni catalyst. Our attempt to carry out in situ IR study of the CO/H2 reaction failed because of the rapid formation of Ni(CO)4 on Ni/SiO2 catalyst. It is important to note that Ni(CO)4 is also highly toxic. We have also observed the rapid exchange between gaseous reactants and their initial adsorbed species for H2/D2 SSITKA in CO/H2/C2H4 and CO/H2 reactions on Rh/SiO2 and the NO/CO reaction on Rh/SiO2 [34]. Thus, probing the reactivities of adsorbed species and their subsequent reaction steps and reaction intermediates requires a judicious choice of transient kinetic techniques. Efstathiou and his coworkers showed that the use of isotopes (13CO2 and 18O2) combined with other step-gas switches (switching an inert gas or a reactant to another reactant flow) provide valuable mechanistic information on the role of lattice oxygen and the reactivity of deposited carbon in the reaction pathway of the dry reforming reaction on CeZrO2-supported Ni and NiCo catalysts as a function of metal particle size [35]. Recently, we studied the reaction of methanol with adsorbed CO2 on Zr-doped CeO2 catalyst in an in-situ IR cell in a batch mode by exposing adsorbed CO2 to methanol (switching gaseous reactant from an inert gas to a reactant) and observing the evolution of products [36]. The transient responses of the IR intensity of adsorbed reactants and product suggested that bidentate carbonate and terminal methoxy species are actively involved in the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) from CO2 and methanol. In summary, in situ IR combined with transient kinetic techniques with carefully designed perturbation (i.e., use of pulses or step-gas concentration switches) to the reaction under specific reaction conditions could be highly effective in providing insight into specific reaction steps and sites in a heterogeneous catalytic reaction. 4 Photocatalytic reaction - simultaneous IR-observation of photogenerated electrons and adsorbed species Figure 4(I) illustrates the reaction pathway for the photocatalytic reaction of adsorbed ethanol in the form of ethoxy (CH3CH2Oad) on a TiO2 catalyst. Under UV irradiation, TiO2 generates photogenerated electrons and holes [37]. The photogenerated hole reacts with adsorbed ethoxy by abstracting its hydrogen, leading to the formation of acetate, CH3COO−, while photogenerated electron reacts with adsorbed oxygen, O2ad, to initiate a sequence of steps. In the absence of oxygen, the electron + O2ad step will not proceed, resulting in the accumulation of photogenerated electrons. It has been well established that photogenerated electron exhibits a broad structureless IR band rising from 3000 to 1000 cm−1 [38]. This band consists of two components: (i) conduction electron band, and (ii) trapped electron band [39–41]. IR coupled with transient kinetic technique allowed direct observation of transient responses of photogenerated electrons and adsorbed species to various forms of stimuli: (i) pulsing one reactant to another under UV irradiation, (ii) step-gas switching of the reactant, (iii) “on” and “off” UV-irradiation [8], and (iv) SSITKA switch mode [42]. Figure 4(II)-(A) shows the evolution of difference IR spectra which were obtained by subtracting the IR spectrum taken prior to the UV irradiation from those taken after UV-irradiation [43]. The difference IR spectra prior to UV irradiation, UV (0 min) showed adsorbed ethanol bands with negative water bands because of the displacement of adsorbed water by adsorbed ethanol. Exposing UV light to adsorbed ethanol on TiO2 in the absence of O2 led to a rapid increase in the structureless IR band in the first 0.6 min, as well as a decrease in adsorbed ethanol IR bands, following a gradual and levelling off trend. Hydrogen in the ethyl group of adsorbed ethanol serves as a hole scavenger with the step: R-H + h+ ➔ R· + H+, where R· is equivalent to CH3CHOad and CH3COad in Fig. 4(I). Since the charge transfer process between photogenerated electron/hole and adsorbed species occurs in the range of microsecond or less, the obtained response of IR intensity of photogenerated electrons on a time scale of seconds reflects many adsorbed ethanol molecules that were not able directly to react with photogenerated electrons on the TiO2 surface. A gradual response of photogenerated electrons indicates that adsorbed species produced from the reaction of photogenerated hole remained on the sites at which the charge transfer process occurred. These species resulting from the reaction with hole hindered a further migration and diffusion of adsorbed ethanol to the surface site for reacting with the hole. Figure 4(II)-(B) shows that pulsing oxygen into adsorbed ethanol/TiO2 under UV irradiation led to a response which shows a decrease in the intensity of the structure-less band. The O2 pulse results show the reaction of oxygen with photogenerated electrons: O2ad + e− ➔ O2 − on a time scale of seconds, reflecting the time needed for O2 molecules to diffuse through adsorbed ethanol layers to reach the sites where photogenerated electrons are located. Further detailed comparison of the spectra with multiple exposures of oxygen pulses showed acetate as a main adsorbed species produced during the photocatalytic oxidation of ethanol. The adsorbed carboxylate species such as acetate and formate have been observed for many catalytic reactions involving alcohols. Their role as a spectator or a reaction intermediate has been unambiguously verified by SSITKA with in situ IR [44–46]. To elucidate the sites where the transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes to the adsorbed species would require a systematic study on TiO2 surface with additives which can block or enhance the charge transfer process. For example, Ag on Ag/TiO2 that is prepared by photo-deposition of Ag nitrate is expected to be deposited on the photoelectron generation sites of TiO2 [47,48]. Investigation of the transient infrared responses of photogenerated electrons and adsorbed species on Ag/TiO2 to a judicious choice of stimuli along with a detailed characterization of the surface structure of catalyst may shed light into the sites where charge transfer processes occur. 5 The CO2-amine reaction The CO2-amine reaction has been extensively studied and used for separating CO2 from a CO2-containing gas streams by a thermal (or temperature) swing adsorption, TSA, process, illustrated in Fig. 5(I) [49,50]. In a TSA process, amine, R-NH2 in various forms of solvent and on various porous solids (adsorber system) is able to selectively react with CO2 present in a CO2-containing gas stream to form absorbed or adsorbed CO2 in the form of ammonium carbamate (R-NH3 +) (R-COO−) and carbamic acid (R-NCOOH) and bicarbonate at low temperatures [51], typically below 60 °C. Then, the adsorber system is regenerated (cleaned) by heating (desorber). Thus, raising amine sorbent or solvent temperatures above 100 °C releases CO2 from amine and regenerates R-NH2. Then, the desorber is turned to the adsorbent state by cooling for the next CO2 adsorption action at low temperatures. The whole process including heating and cooling constitutes a TSA-CO2 capture process. The TSA-CO2 capture process can be applied to coal and natural-gas power plants to minimize their CO2 emissions; the TSA process can also be applied to the direct capture of CO2 from air (DAC). DAC constitutes a carbon-negative technology, allowing removal of CO2 produced from those sectors with a staggering direct CO2 removal cost. Ongoing research has been directed toward reducing the energy demand for TSA-CO2 capture by systematic studies of various forms of amine solvents and sorbents. Reducing energy demand requires amine sorbent/solvent to exhibit a number of characteristics: high CO2 adsorption rate, low amine regeneration temperature, and high TSA-CO2 capture capacity in terms of number of CO2 moles which can be produced from regenerating one gram of amine solvent/sorbent [52]. We employed in situ IR with transient kinetic technique to investigate both kinetics and mechanism of the CO2-amine reaction in an amine solvent and sorbent system. Fig. 5 (II)-(a) illustrates the responses in the form of IR profiles of ammonium carbamate, adsorbed OH, and amine to a step-gas concentration function in the input (i.e., inlet stream). This step function was produced by switching an Ar gas flow to an air gas flow which contains 400 ppm CO2 and 0.5% H2O [53]. The breakthrough curve of adsorbed CO2 in the form of ammonium carbamate shown in Fig. 5 (II)-(a) and its IR spectra in Fig. 5(II)-(b) show the kinetics of the forward amine-CO reaction, i.e., the CO2 adsorption process. Note that the rate of CO2 adsorption can be determined by the slope of the breakthrough curve. The concentration of water vapor in air is higher than that of CO2. Interestingly, 440 ppm CO2 was able to compete with 0.5% H2O vapor for amine sites as shown by the formation of ammonium carbamate prior to that of adsorbed water at 3519 cm−1 (Fig. 5 II-(b)). The breakthrough curve, equivalent to the transient response curve in the SSITKA, showed that the coverage of adsorbed CO2 increased and then levelled off as most amine sites reacted with CO2. The IR spectra showed initial formation of ammonium carbamate with a low intensity of a very broad hydrogen bonding with several humps in the 2100–3200 cm−1 region, followed by the formation of ammonium carbamate with an intense and broad hydrogen bonding band. The assignment of the broad hydrogen bonding band was based on both experimental IR and DFT theoretical studies [49,54]. The responses to a step-gas concentration switch from the flow of air back to that of Ar gave the CO2 desorption profile which shows a gradual decline in the IR intensity of ammonium carbamate and a growth of amine intensity as shown in Fig. 5 (II)-(a) and their IR spectra in Fig. 5II-(c). Desorbing adsorbed CO2 with a purging Ar gas flow for 8 min showed that a significant fraction of those ammonium carbamate with an intensive hydrogen bonding remained on the sorbent, suggesting that the ammonium carbamate with high IR intensity of hydrogen bonding has a higher binding energy than those with low IR intensity of hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bond energy is known to be governed by the distance between its acceptor and donor. Thus, we can deduce that the species with a higher IR intensity for hydrogen bonding resulted from the reaction of CO2 with amine pairs which have a short inter-amine distance. This insight has guided us in a sorbent design and led us to develop PEG (polyethylene glycol)-amine sorbent in which PEG serves as a spacer to increase the inter-amine distance in the sorbent in order to increase the distance of hydrogen bonding between ammonium and carbamate. Indeed, PEG-amine sorbents can be regenerated at a lower temperature than typical amine sorbents. The IR coupled with the transient kinetic technique can be employed to address how the chemical environment of amine affects key parameters: kinetics of adsorption and desorption and relative binding energies of various forms of adsorbed CO2 such as low hydrogen-bonded and high hydrogen-bonded ammonium carbamate and carbamic acid. A molecular level understanding of amine-CO2 reaction in various forms of solvents and sorbents will allow devising the amine structure in the solvent or sorbent for decreasing the energy demand for the TSA-CO2 separation in chemical and natural gas industries, as well as CO2 capture processes for DAC (direct-air-capture) and CO2 emissions from coal/natural gas-fired power plants. 6 Implication of transient kinetics in catalyst design Combining mechanistic information from each of the transient studies of the CO/H2/C2H4 reaction previously presented, we could delineate a picture about the active sites which could serve as a basis for catalyst design for further developments or improvements. For example, Mn additive in the form of MnO, which is oxophilic, tends to interact with metal oxides. Thus, MnO could situate at the interface between Rh and SiO2, promoting the Rh site for both CO insertion and hydrogenation of acyl species. The identification of single Rh sites for CO insertion by the batch reaction of adsorbed CO with C2H4/H2 allowed us to add Ag atom and S atom as additives to block the bridge CO site and to increase the linear CO site for CO insertion, enhancing therefore both the rate and selectivity for propionaldehyde formation in the CO/H2/C2H4 reaction [55–58]. Thus, a rational catalyst design of Rh/SiO2 catalyst for the ethylene hydroformylation (CO/H2/C2H4) reaction could be achieved by increasing the number of active sites by adding Mn additives first, and then converting bridge CO sites to single Rh sites by adding Ag or S additives. The transient photocatalytic oxidation study with pulsing oxygen into adsorbed ethanol allowed breaking down the overall reaction path into the oxidation of ethanol with photogenerated hole and reduction of oxygen with photogenerated electrons. In situ IR results presented in Fig. 4 showed that these steps occur at a time scale of minutes, in contrast to the time scale of micro-seconds for the charge transfer in redox reaction steps observed by a high-resolution transient IR [59]. The slowness of the reaction steps shown in Fig. 4 can be attributed to the hydrophilic nature of TiO2 which strongly interacts with hydrophilic adsorbed species, including acetate and adsorbed ethanol. Note that TiO2-based catalysts switch from a hydrophobic to a superhydrophilic state under UV radiation. Thus, enhancing hydrophobicity of TiO2-based catalysts should be considered as a key factor in the design of future photo-catalysts. In addition, transient operation of photocatalytic process with a certain period of light-off could allow the catalyst surface to return to its hydrophobic state, repelling those hydrophilic adsorbed species from the active sites. 7 Summary SSITKA and unsteady-state transient kinetic experiments coupled with in situ IR can produce insightful mechanistic information and kinetic data to underlying reaction mechanisms in heterogeneous catalysis. Developing a detailed reaction mechanism requires the use of a series of characterization techniques and computational approaches in addition to transient kinetics. The required dedication of both IR and MS spectrometers to the study, experimental challenges in producing a well-defined stimulus, setting up a leak-free in-situ IR reactors, and the transient nature of reactive adsorbed species are some factors that limited the widespread use of in situ IR coupled with transient kinetic experiments in heterogeneous catalysis research. In situ rapid-scan time-resolved Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with transient kinetic approaches remains an alternative to monitor the dynamics of adsorbed reaction intermediates in the time scale of microseconds as opposed to most of the work conducted so far on the transient behavior of IR-observable adsorbed species on a time scale of several seconds and minutes using standard FTIR/MCT detector system. Many reactions including electrochemical oxidation of CH4 in the anode of a solid-oxide fuel cell at 750 °C produced responses on a scale of seconds [60]. Our SSITKA studies also showed that either a step or pulse mode in the stimuli produced the same mechanistic information in which the step-gas concentration response is equivalent to the integration of the pulse response. The use of a pulse-gas stimulus can significantly decrease the amount of costly isotope-labelled species used in the SSITKA methodology. However, it should be made clear that determination of other important kinetic parameters obtained with SSITKA, such as the surface coverage of active intermediates at the working catalytic surface, cannot be obtained if the amount of the isotope-labelled species in a pulse-gas stimulus is not sufficient to completely enter the reaction pathway, establishing a true steady-state chemical environment with non-isotope labelled species. Thus, an operando pulse-gas IR technique cannot lead to safe conclusions about the chemical nature of active/inactive intermediates as opposed to the operando SSITKA-FTIR for the same reasons. Catalysis research remains to be an experimental science which requires trial-and-errors within the framework of basic catalysis principles. To cut down the extensive effort needed for catalyst screening and optimization studies, an insight into the reaction mechanism is needed for devising approaches to manipulate the sites and reaction steps in catalysis. A systematic study of well characterized catalysts with varying structures and additives, as well as a judicious choice of operando spectroscopies coupled with transient kinetic techniques [61] will provide an insight into the active sites, where the reactive adsorbed species reside, and their reactivity (k, rate constant) and coverage, which will further advance catalysis science and technology. Integration of mechanistic information with an array of catalyst characterization results is essential for building the knowledge base of catalyst structure-property-performance relationship which could guide catalyst design [62].

        "dc:description": "The dynamic reaction behavior (i.e., transient responses) of IR-observable adsorbed species and gaseous products obtained from transient kinetic studies provide valuable kinetic and mechanistic information, namely: the abundance of active intermediates and their reactivity distribution, the chemical structure of IR-observable active and spectator species, the sequence of their formation, and the kinetically significant and rate-determining step under reaction conditions of practical catalysis. We discuss the use of transient response data to elucidate the reaction mechanisms of several gas-solid reactions: CO/H2, CO/H2/C2H4, photocatalytic oxidation of ethanol, and the CO2-amine reaction. The IR coupled with transient kinetic techniques is especially useful for investigating the mechanisms of photocatalytic reactions because both photogenerated electrons and many adsorbed species are IR-active (exhibiting measurable IR bands), and their evolution occurs on a time scale of seconds at ambient temperature. We highlight the key features and limitations of in situ IR with transient kinetics, as well as their significance in catalyst design.",
