Graphical abstract By using the special structure of the eggshell and its interaction with Co3O4, the performance of the catalyst in the catalytic oxidation of benzene is improved. And schematic diagram of reaction mechanism for catalytic benzene oxidation over Co3O4/Eggshell is speculated. Moreover, eggshell as carrier is environmentally friendly and low-cost, which can achieve more promising application. Transition metal oxides have excellent catalytic activities for the oxidation of VOCs, in which it is necessary to find new catalysts/supports with cheap and environmentally-friendly properties. Herein, Co3O4 nanoparticles decorated eggshell catalysts were firstly synthesized via impregnation method, where the waste eggshell is used as an effective hard template and an excellent support with porous structure. A series of Co3O4/Eggshell catalysts were synthesized by changing the different concentration of precursors (different Co3O4 loadings), which were defined as Co3O4/Eggshell-1 (33.1 %), Co3O4/Eggshell-2 (16.7 %) and Co3O4/Eggshell-3 (9.1 %) catalysts. Among of them, the Co3O4/Eggshell-2 exhibited the best activity with the temperature T90 % = 256 ℃, which is about 90 °C lower than Co3O4/oyster shell-2 (benzene catalytic oxidation). And the catalytic activity of Co3O4/Eggshell is remarkably improved as compared to commercially pure Co3O4 nanoparticles and commercially CaCO3. The excellent activity can be attributed to the unique structure of the eggshell and the interaction of CaCO3 and Co3O4. In addition, the catalyst has also showed long-term stability. Moreover, the reaction mechanism of benzene catalytic oxidation was further revealed by in-situ FTIR studies. Keywords Co3O4 Eggshell Benzene oxidation VOCs CaCO3 1 Introduction Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced from industrial sources such as petroleum refining and living sources (e.g. architectural decoration) have been considered as major pollutants in recent years. These gases are not only carcinogenic to humans, but also have been proved to be associated with environmental issues such as greenhouse effects, stratospheric ozone depletion, etc. [1,2]. Solving VOCs pollution is becoming an urgent task worldwide. Currently, many methods have been proposed to reduce VOCs emissions including physico-chemical adsorption, bioremoval and chemical catalytic oxidation [3,4]. Among of them, catalytic oxidation is considered to be the most effective way to solve the above problem. Unlike other methods, catalytic oxidation has the advantage to completely convert VOCs into CO2 and H2O [5,6]. Furthermore, the conversion via this method can be carried out at low temperature, being highly efficient and superior to the direct burning of VOCs gas [7,8]. Precious metal catalysts have been shown to possess high activity and conversion efficiency for catalytic oxidation of VOCs including Pt-based catalysts [9–11], Pd-based catalysts [12–14] as well as Au-based catalysts [15,16]. Their high cost and compromised stability have largely limited their industrial developments. To this end, catalysts based on transition metals with low-costs and good activities emerged as a promising replacement for precious metals [17,18]. Some satisfying results have been obtained after a series of explorations, especially in the catalytic oxidations of VOCs using p-type metal oxide catalysts [2,19]. P-type metal oxides were reported to optimally bind oxygen and the electrons of such oxides can be easily transferred to form reactive substances [7,20]. Certain relevant progress has been made using metal oxides for VOCs removal including not only single metal oxides such as Co3O4 [17,21], MnOx [22,23], and CeO2 [24,25], but also mixed metal oxides i.e. La-Co [26], Co-Ce [27–29], Co-Ni [30] Co-Mn [31] and Mn-Ce [32] etc. Co3O4 is considered to be the most promising catalyst for VOCs oxidation, being a low-cost and relatively non-toxic alternative and has been successfully employed in various oxidation reactions [17,33–35]. Moreover, Co3O4 catalysts have been synthesized in a variety of shapes including 2D and 3D nanostructures i.e. microspheres, flowers, and fan-shaped, etc. [17,36–39]. Nevertheless, most reported Co3O4 nanoparticles still possess significant drawbacks including poor dispersion ability, difficult separation from the reaction mixture and serious agglomeration with time on stream. To solve these problems, immobilizing nanoparticles on/into solid supports to form nanocomposites might be a good strategy towards the development of advanced functional materials [40]. Mesoporous carbon [41,42], porous silica [43] and Al2O3 [44] have been widely exploited for the immobilization of Co3O4 nanoparticles. However, the availability and preparation costs are the most frequent issues in practical applications, with a real need for seeking cost-effective, environmental friendly and easy-to-use supports [45,46]. Eggshell contains cuticle, calcium carbonate and the mammillary layer from the outside to the inside. There are about 7000–17000 holes between the first layer and the second layer for exchanging substances [47]. CaCO3 is the main inorganic component of the eggshell, ca. 96 wt.%, with a minor content of organic components such as proteins and polysaccharides [48]. Eggshell is generally discarded as side-product from the dairy industry, causing serious environmental pollution and a waste of resources [49]. In fact, eggshell has been reported for a wide range of applications including acting as electrode [50], tissue scaffold [51] as well as biodiesel catalyst [52,53]. Eggshell is also recently reported as an economic and environmental friendly support for heterogeneous catalysts production, exhibiting a synergistic catalytic effect [54]. Inspired by these previous works, while considering its intrinsic porous structure, richness in chemical groups (strong metal protein bonding ability), firm and hierarchical architecture, herein we reported the synthesis of an eggshell-templated Co3O4/CaCO3 catalyst. As-prepared catalyst was employed in the catalytic oxidation of benzene and found to show an excellent activity compared with commercial Co3O4. Herein, our work not only achieves the goal of reducing costs (only a small amount of metal is used to obtain the satisfying result of a commercial transition metal catalyst) and reducing environmental pollution, but also provides a simple and efficient synthesis method for possible industrial mass production. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Cobalt acetate (C4H6O4·Co·4H2O) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (China). Waste eggshells were obtained from the second canteen of Quanzhou Normal University, Quanzhou, Fujian. They were simply rinsed with deionized water, and then dried at room temperature. Eggshell powder was obtained by pulverizing the above dried shell and passed through a 200 mesh sieve. All the chemical reagents were used as received without further purification. Other chemicals were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, China. 2.2 Preparation of Co3O4/Eggshell catalysts Co3O4/Eggshell catalysts were prepared by impregnation method with the concentration of cobalt acetate being 0.05 mol/L,0.1 mol/L, 0.25 mol/L. Firstly, C2H3CoO2 was dissolved in 50 mL deionized water, and then 2 g eggshell powder was added into the solution under vigorous stirring at room temperature for 12 h. After that, the solvent was removed under stirring at 80 ℃ for 4 h. The catalyst was put in an oven at 50 ℃ for 12 h and then calcined at 300 ℃, 400 ℃, and 500 ℃ for 4 h with the rate 2 ℃/min. The different concentrations of Co3O4 loaded-eggshell catalysts were defined as Co3O4/Eggshell-1 (33.1 %), Co3O4/Eggshell-2 (16.7 %) and Co3O4/Eggshell-3 (9.1 %). 2.3 Catalysts characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was obtained via an X’Pert Pro X-ray Diffractometer (PANalytical BV, The Netherlands) with CuK radiation under a voltage of 35 kV and a current of 15 mA. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on the Tecnai F30 microscope, in which the operating voltage is 300 kV. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were carried out using ZEISS SIGMA (Germany). Surface area of the catalysts was recorded by Micromeritics Instrument (Shanghai) Ltd. (3Flax, USA). Thermogravimetric (TG) characterization was obtained by a TA Instruments Q50 (US) thermal analyzer with a heating rate of 5 ℃/min in the air. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a monochromated Al Kα (1486.7 eV) as X-ray source. (Physical Electronics, USA) was used to determine the surface elements and the chemical states of Co3O4/Eggshell. H2-Ar (5/95, v/v) mixture was used as a filling gas to obtain the data of hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) on a chemical adsorption analyzer (MFTP-3060, China). Prior to the H2-TPR operation, the samples were dried in Ar flow of 30 mL/min at 300 °C for 1 h, and the samples were heated from room temperature to 900 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min in the 50 mL/min H2-Ar mixture. FTIR spectra were measured on a Nicolet Avatar 660 (Nicolet 6700, USA). 2.4 Catalytic activity measurements A continuous flow fixed-bed quartz microreactor (inner diameter = 5 mm) was used to evaluate the activity of catalyst with the amount of 50 mg. 1000 ppm benzene was introduced into the reactor bed, in which the benzene/O2 molar ratio was 1/400. Using N2 react as balance gas, the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) is adjusted as 20000, 40000, 80,000 and 100,000 mL/g/h. A double FID detectors gas chromatograph (GC-9160, Ouhua China) were used to analyze the reactants and products online. A TDX-01packed column (1 m × 2 mm) and a SE-54 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.5 um) were employed to analyze CO2 and benzene concentrations with Ar and N2 as protective gases, respectively. Catalytic activity measurement mainly uses benzene conversion rate as the main means, and the benzene conversion rate (Cbenzene) and CO2 yield (YCO2)is calculated as follows: C benzene = C 0 - C 1 C 0 × 100 % Y C O 2 = C 3 C 2 × 100 % Where, C0 and C1 are the concentration of benzene before and after passing the catalyst, C2 means the concentration of CO2 when benzene is completely converted, and C3 is the concentration of CO2 after passing the catalyst. 2.5 In situ FTIR In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was performed by a Nicolet Avatar 660 with an analytical parameter of 4 cm−1, 32 scans, cooled by liquid nitrogen and using an MCT detector. Before the experiment, 100 ml/min of N2 was introduced into the in-situ bath for rinsing. Subsequently, approximately 15 mg sample was tableted and placed in an in situ pool, followed by activation at 50 ml/min N2 or N2/40 % O2 for 1 h under vacuum at 400 °C. It was then cooled to 360 °C. After the background was collected under activated gas, 50 ml/min of feed gas was passed into the in-situ cell to collect spectra at different times. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of the pure support and catalysts 3.1.1 XRD analysis Fig. 1 a shows the XRD patterns of pure eggshell and three composite Co3O4/Eggshell catalysts (all calcined at 400 ℃) synthesized by adding three different precursor concentrations into the same amount of eggshell powder. For the pure eggshell, it can be found that the angles 2θ = 23.0、29.4、31.4、35.2、39.4、43.1、47.5、48.5、56.6、57.4、60.6° are attributed to the typical diffraction peak of CaCO3 (Calcite, JCPDS PDF#05-0586). Furthermore, in order to show a clear XRD pattern of Co3O4, high loading catalyst (the concentration of C2H3CoO2 1 mol/L) was prepared, revealing an efficient coating of Co3O4 on CaCO3. The result is shown in Fig. S1. In comparison with pure eggshell, several extra diffraction peaks at 2θ = 19.0、31.3、36.9、38.5、44.8、55.7、59.4、65.2° occurred, which are corresponding to the crystal faces of (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511) and (440) of Co3O4, respectively (JCPDS PDF#42-1467). The magnification of Co3O4 peaks are acquired in Fig. 1b, in which the diffraction peak of Co3O4 (311) was found to increase with an increase in Co3O4 loading. This indicated that the formation of more abundant Co3O4 particles and the close incorporation between Co3O4 nanoparticles and CaCO3 support. In addition, no other diffraction peaks are observed, revealing the pure phase of Co3O4 and CaCO3. 3.1.2 SEM and TEM analysis The main inorganic component of eggshell being CaCO3, in which the eggshell particles were found to exhibit jagged shapes and staggered structures, as observed in Fig. 2 a. At further magnifications (Fig. 2b), a uniform circular nanoparticle distribution on the sheet structure or in the holes could be observed, corresponding to Co3O4 nanoparticles supported on the eggshell. Furthermore, this morphological feature can be clearly observed in TEM images. As shown in Fig. 2c, the spherical Co3O4 is evenly distributed over the eggshell. EDX elemental mapping shows the presence and distribution of C, Ca, Co and O in the catalyst (Fig. 2d-h). HRTEM images (Fig. 2i) of Co3O4/Eggshell-2 displayed lattice spacings of 0.46 nm and 0.26 nm, attributed to the diffraction plane (111) of Co3O4 and (112) of CaCO3, respectively. 3.1.3 XPS analysis To determine the surface elemental composition and oxidation state of the catalyst, XPS spectra were recorded. XPS high resolution C 1s core level spectra acquired in the range of 280–295 eV are shown in Fig. 3 a, there are two peaks located at 284.6 eV, 289.7 eV, which can be associated with C-C/C–H and inadequate combustion of organics, respectively. Fig. 3b shows that Ca 2p spectra of Co3O4/Eggshell-2, the peak at 347.3 eV belongs to Ca 2p3/2, while the binding energy of 350.6 eV reflects Ca 2p1/2. By calculation, the spacing of the two peaks is approximately 3.3 eV, which is approximately the same as that of calcium in calcium carbonate [34]. Co 2p (Fig. 3c) peaks can be decomposed into two components with binding energies at 780.0 eV (Co 2p3/2) and 795.2 eV (Co 2p1/2), respectively [55]. The peaks at 794.2 eV, 797.6 eV, 782.2 eV and 779.4 eV are characteristics of Co2+, while the peaks at 795.5 eV and 780.3 eV belong to Co3+. Besides, the satellite peaks at 804.5 eV and 789.4 eV are attributed to Co2+ and Co3+, respectively [55]. O1 s spectra of Co3O4/Eggshell-2 can be decomposed into two components, as shown in Fig. 3d. The component with binding energy at 529.7 eV can be assigned to surface lattice oxygen (Olatt), while that of binding energy ca. 532.7 eV is regarded as surface adsorption oxygen species (Oads). 3.1.4 TG and FTIR analysis TG measurement is used to study the weight loss of the catalyst during calcination. TG curves of Co3O4/Eggshell-2 and pure eggshell are shown in Fig. 4 a. Compared with pure eggshell, it can be found that there is a slight decrease in the curve for Co3O4/Eggshell-2 at 25–250 ℃, which is attributed to the decomposition of organic matter on the eggshell, adsorbed water and crystal water. At 250–500 ℃, the curve shows a sharp decline, which can be regarded as the decomposition of cobalt acetate. However, at 600–790 ℃, the downward trend of the two curves is exactly the same, which is caused by the decomposition of calcium carbonate into CO2. In addition, FTIR spectra of the pure eggshell and Co3O4/Eggshell-2 are obtained to determine the presence of different functional groups. As shown in Fig. 4b, nine characteristic absorption peaks on each spectrum could be observed, almost the same without a large offset (almost identical in terms of functional groups). Moreover, the loading of the Co3O4 nanoparticles has no effect on the absorption peaks of these functional groups. Analyzing these characteristic peaks by taking pure eggshell as example shows an absorption peak centered at 3494 cm−1, generally recognized as the stretching vibration of the −OH in the adsorption water. The three weak absorption peaks at 2976, 2875, 1801 cm−1 can be determined to be caused by the stretching vibration of CO bonds from carbonates. The peak at 2517 cm−1 can be attributed to the characteristic peak of CaCO3. The strongest absorption peak at 1422 cm−1 can be considered as the CO stretching mode of CaCO3. The peak at 876 and 713 cm−1 correspond to internal and external deformation mode unique to CaCO3. The absorption peak at position 1635 cm−1 can be regarded as the vibration of the NH bond of a certain type of protein. Compared to pure eggshell, the infrared signature of all catalysts has two more absorption peaks, located at positions of 586 and 669 cm−1, respectively. Furthermore, the absorption peak of metal oxidation is located in this range, hence these two absorption peaks are considered to belong to the absorption peak of Co3O4. 3.1.5 H2-TPR analysis H2-TPR characterization was employed to verify the reducibility of the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5 , pure eggshell contains only one peak at 772 °C which can be attributed to the decomposition of calcium carbonate into CO2. Compared to pure eggshell, the decomposition peak of calcium carbonate of Co3O4/Eggshell-3 is transferred to the position at 725 ℃. Furthermore, as the loading amount of Co3O4 increases, two extra different diffraction peaks located at 673 ℃ and 642 ℃ appear in the curves of Co3O4/Eggshell-1 and Co3O4/Eggshell-2, respectively. According to the Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism, this phenomenon pointed to a strong interaction between Co3O4 nanoparticles and CaCO3 [56], which leads to the low decomposition temperature of CaCO3. Importantly, Co3O4/Eggshell-2 exhibited a lower decomposition temperature (642 °C), possibly related to a good catalytic activity. A peak at 300 °C in Co3O4/Eggshell-3 was observed, which can be attributed to the reduction of Co3+ to Co°. In contrast, for Co3O4/Eggshell-1 and Co3O4/Eggshell-2, two reduction peaks were also observed (288 °C, reduction of Co3+to Co2+ and removal of surface adsorbed oxygen; 409 °C, reduction of Co2+ to Co°). The difference of peaks is mainly due to the different loading of Co3O4. Co loading is low in Co3O4/Eggshell-3. Hence, the reduction peak of Co3O4 is not obvious, and the reduction process is not clear. 3.1.6 BET analysis As shown in Fig. 6 , the nitrogen adsorption-desorption curve of pure eggshell belongs to type Ⅲ, which can be attributed to interparticle meso/macroporosity (voids created in between particles) of eggshell. With the loading of Co3O4, its curve type becomes type Ⅳ, and the specific surface area is significantly increased (Table 1 ), this can be attributed to the porous morphology of Co3O4. 3.2 Catalytic performance on benzene oxidation Untreated eggshell exhibited no catalytic activity in benzene oxidation until the temperature reaches 380 ℃ (Fig. 7 a). Benzene conversion efficiency for Co3O4/Eggshell catalysts (all calcined at 400 ℃) was significantly improved as shown in Fig. 7. Herein, in order to easily evaluate the activity of the catalysts (different loadings and calcined temperatures), the temperature at the conversion of benzene reached 90 % (T90%) is taken as a standard. Moreover, the turnover frequencies of Co (TOFCo) are calculated for the kinetic studies. The calculation formula is as follow: TOF Co = C benzene X benzene V gas n Co ( s - 1 ) As shown in the Fig. 7a, in general, the activity of the catalysts (all calcined at 400 ℃) increases with an increase in Co3O4 loading. However, after the precursor concentration (C2H3CoO2) is over a certain value, the activity of Co3O4/Eggshell-2 (16.7 %) is almost identical to that of Co3O4/Eggshell-1 (33.1 %). By taking the material economy into consideration, Co3O4/Eggshell-2 catalyst was further selected as key catalyst for subsequent student, for which the corresponding T90 % was found to be 256 ℃, similar to other reported types of catalysts (Table S1). TOFCo values are calculated at low conversions (220 °C) under a kinetically controlled regime for the oxidation of benzene [57,58]. TOFCo (10−6 s-1) values of all catalysts were found to follow the order of activity: Co3O4/Eggshell-2 (0.719) > Co3O4/Eggshell-1 (0.285), since Co3O4/Eggshell-3 does not show any activity at 220 °C, in good agreement with results from Fig. 5 (Co3O4/Eggshell-2 has the lowest decomposition temperature of calcium carbonate). Fig. 7b shows the yield of CO2 is same as the conversion of benzene, which proves that benzene is completely converted to ÇO2 and H2O with no other by-products. Calcination plays a key role in obtaining eggshell-loaded Co3O4 catalysts, different calcination temperatures may result in different catalytic activities. Considering Co3O4/Eggshell-2 as key system for comparative purposes, its’ catalytic activity was further evaluated by changing the calcination temperature. Results are shown in Fig. 7c. Benzene conversion increases as the temperature increases from 300 to 400 ℃, but significantly declined as the temperature reached 500 ℃. TOFCo (10−6 s-1) values of all catalysts were subsequently found to be in the order: Co3O4/Eggshell-400 ℃ (0.719) > Co3O4/Eggshell-500 ℃ (0.400) > Co3O4/Eggshell-300 ℃ (0.242). Furthermore, it can be seen from TEM images and the corresponding histograms of Co3O4 NPs distribution (Fig. S2 and Fig. 2c), the average particle size increased slowly as the calcination temperature increased from 300 to 400 ℃, which corresponded to 3.93 and 5.83 nm, respectively. Nevertheless, the average particle size of Co3O4 NPs dramatically increased to 9.36 nm when the calcining temperature was 500 ℃, which suggested the obvious agglomeration of the Co3O4 NPs at this temperature. Hence, 400 ℃ could be regarded as optimum calcination temperature. These also correspond to the optimum crystalline structure of Co3O4 at 400 °C, in good agreement with XRD results as Fig. S3 shown that the intensity of the diffraction peak of Co3O4 at 400 ℃ is relatively strong, compared with the other two temperatures. Fig. 7d also shows that benzene is completely converted to ÇO2 and H2O with no other by-products. To prove the superiority of eggshell as support, oyster shells (also rich in calcium carbonate) were selected for comparative purposes. Identical catalytic systems were synthesized based on oyster shells and the effect of benzene catalytic oxidation was subsequently evaluated (Fig. S4). By comparing two different types of catalysts, the activity of Co3O4/Eggshell was found to be significantly improved as compared to Co3O4/oyster shells, proved by T90 % of Co3O4/Eggshell-2 (256 ℃) vs T90 % of Co3O4/oyster shell-2 (420 °C). TOFCo (10−6 s−1) values of Co3O4/Eggshell-2 (0.719) was also three times higher to those of Co3O4/oyster shell-2 (0.184). The difference in activity between the two catalysts is mainly determined by the differences in support structure/morphology. Eggshell has a porous structure and the oyster shell is composed of a relatively dense layered structure. This allows benzene to be in better contact with the active ingredient of Co3O4 through the pore structure on the eggshell, while the contact of benzene with Co3O4 on the Co3O4/oyster shell catalyst may be blocked by the dense structure of the oyster shell. More importantly, for transition metal oxides, the catalytic oxidation of benzene is the exchange of oxygen on its surface. In summary, the eggshell as a support has obvious advantages. 3.3 Comparison among Co3O4/Eggshell-2, Co3O4/CaCO3-com and Co3O4-com As shown in Fig. 8 , the benzene conversion was done by using Co3O4 /Eggshell-2 and Co3O4/CaCO3-com, both catalysts were prepared using the same method and with the same Co3O4 loading amount (16.7 %), except that commercial CaCO3 was used as the carrier to replace eggshell. It can be seen that the performance of Co3O4 /Eggshell-2 (T90 % = 258 ℃) is better than that of Co3O4/CaCO3-com (T90 % = 275 ℃). This can be attributed to the special structure of the eggshell, which is the same as described above. Moreover, Co3O4/Eggshell-2 provided excellent results as compared to commercial Co3O4, T90 % of Co3O4/Eggshell-2 (258 ℃) vs T90 % of Co3O4-com (270 ℃), respectively. More importantly, Co loading in Co3O4/Eggshell-2 is 16.7 %, which can significantly reduce the cost of the catalyst in future large-scale production. The reason for this satisfying result can be considered as the interaction between calcium carbonate in the eggshell and Co3O4. This is also consistent with results from H2-TPR (Fig. 5). 3.4 Stability of the Co3O4/Eggshell-2 catalyst The stability of the catalyst is also one of important parameters for its performance. The stability of Co3O4/Eggshell-2 was then measured for 50 h of time-on-stream. As shown in Fig. 9 , the performance of the catalyst was consistently stabilized at ca. 95 % benzene conversion, with no relevant deactivation after long reaction runs. Characterization methods such as SEM, XRD and TEM were employed to investigate any changes on the catalyst before and after reaction (Fig. S5), pointing to a high stability of the catalyst under the investigated reaction conditions. 3.5 In situ FTIR studies In order to further explore the reaction mechanism of benzene catalytic oxidation, In-situ FTIR experiments under different conditions were subsequently carried out. The catalytic reaction mechanism is proposed by real-time monitoring of surface species. As shown in (i) and (ii) of Fig. 10 , the spectra were collected for 10 and 30 min of adsorption of pure eggshell under 1000 ppm benzene/40 % O2/N2 stream. It can be found that there is almost no obvious absorption peak under this condition. However, the case of Co3O4/Eggshell-2 is quite different under the same conditions. Several obvious bands are observed in Fig.10 (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii). The band at 1786 cm−1 can be attributed to the vibration of the carbonyl bond of anthraquinones [59]. The bands at 1614, 1509 cm−1 is caused by adsorption of an aromatic ring parallel to the surface of the catalyst [60]. The band at 1585 cm−1 can be assigned to the oscillation of the oxidized carboxylate ring [43]. The band located at 1547 cm−1 can be seen as the vibration of CC bonds in phenolics on the surface [61]. The peaks at 1452, 1332 cm−1 are the rocking vibration of CC bonds in maleate [59]. Besides, band at 1407 cm-1 is caused by o-benzoquinones [62]. Furthermore, the band at 1360 cm-1 is classified to acetate [63]. It can be accepted that the band at 3241 cm-1 is caused by the vibration of hydroxyl groups in phenolics [61]. The bands at 3033−3174 cm-1 can be considered as the vibration of the C–H bond in the aromatic ring [61]. And the band at 2979 cm-1 can be assigned to C–H stretching vibration [43]. These results are similar to those previously published for the catalytic oxidation of benzene. In order to determine if the addition of oxygen for this reaction is necessary, the spectra were also obtained by treating Co3O4/Eggshell-2 for 1, 5, 10, 30, 60 min at 360 ℃ and 1000 ppm benzene/ N2 stream. As shown in Fig. S6, the peaks of each intermediate can be observed. Therefore, Co3O4/Eggshell-2 can catalyze the decomposition of benzene under these conditions, and contains intermediates such as acetate, maleate, o-benzoquinones and phenolics. Furthermore, the addition of oxygen only increases the intensity of the peak and there are no new intermediate products. Regardless of the addition of oxygen, the catalyst always catalyzes the decomposition of benzene and produces the same intermediate product. From this, it can be seen that the active oxygen species (Olatt and Oads) in the catalyst directly participate in the reaction. 3.6 Reaction mechanism Based on in situ FTIR studies, the catalytic reaction mechanism of benzene on Co3O4/Eggshell catalyst is proposed (Fig. 11 ). Firstly, benzene (A) is adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst at the Co active site, followed by oxidation to phenolics (B) promoted by active oxygen species (Olatt and Oads). It is well known that phenols have good chemical activity due to their hydroxyl functional groups. Phenolics easily form benzoquinones (C, D). Subsequently, under the action of active oxygen and the catalyst, the benzoquinones are ring-opened to form acetate (E) and maleate (F), which are further oxidized to CO2 and H2O. In this process, oxygen in the environment is converted into active oxygen (Olatt and Oads) on the catalyst. 4 Conclusion In summary, waste-derived eggshells were employed as support for metal oxide (Co3O4 nanoparticles) systems and identified to play a key role in the catalytic oxidation of benzene. The catalytic effect of synthesized optimum Co3O4/Eggshell materials is remarkably improved as compared to commercially pure Co3O4 nanoparticles, in which the temperature required to achieve a benzene conversion of 90 % (T90 %) is 256 ℃. In-situ FTIR characterization and analysis could provide further insights into the reaction mechanism, in which active oxygen species (Olatt and Oads) play a key role in benzene catalytic oxidation.

        "dc:description": "Transition metal oxides have excellent catalytic activities for the oxidation of VOCs, in which it is necessary to find new catalysts/supports with cheap and environmentally-friendly properties. Herein, Co3O4 nanoparticles decorated eggshell catalysts were firstly synthesized via impregnation method, where the waste eggshell is used as an effective hard template and an excellent support with porous structure. A series of Co3O4/Eggshell catalysts were synthesized by changing the different concentration of precursors (different Co3O4 loadings), which were defined as Co3O4/Eggshell-1 (33.1 %), Co3O4/Eggshell-2 (16.7 %) and Co3O4/Eggshell-3 (9.1 %) catalysts. Among of them, the Co3O4/Eggshell-2 exhibited the best activity with the temperature T90 % = 256 ℃, which is about 90 °C lower than Co3O4/oyster shell-2 (benzene catalytic oxidation). And the catalytic activity of Co3O4/Eggshell is remarkably improved as compared to commercially pure Co3O4 nanoparticles and commercially CaCO3. The excellent activity can be attributed to the unique structure of the eggshell and the interaction of CaCO3 and Co3O4. In addition, the catalyst has also showed long-term stability. Moreover, the reaction mechanism of benzene catalytic oxidation was further revealed by in-situ FTIR studies.",
