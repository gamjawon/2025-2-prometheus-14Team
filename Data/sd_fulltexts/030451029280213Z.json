Zhecheva*, R. Stoyanova Institute of General and Inorganic Chemistry, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia 1040 (Bulgaria.) and R. Klissurska Institute of Kinetics and Catalysis, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia 1040 (Bulgaria) (Received February 13, 1992; accepted June 9, 1992) Abstract The interaction between the components of LiCl-C0304 and LiOH-Co304 catalysts for oxidative coupling of methane has been studied by ESR, TPR and specific surface area measurements. The interaction between Co304 and LiCl begins at temperatures higher than the melting point of LiCl, lithium-cobalt spinels with a low lithium content (about 0.03 at.%) being obtained. Lithium-cobalt spinels with a much higher lithium content (more than 2.5 at.%) and a LiCo02 phase are obtained from Co304 and LiOH. The higher activity and selectivity of L'CI-Co3()4 for oxidative coupling of methane in comparison with LiOH-Co304 are related to surface effects rather than to formation of mixed Li-Co oxide phases. LiCl modifies spinel morphology and forms a dense layer over the spinel crystallites. The effect of water vapour (a reaction product of the oxidative coupling of methane) on the catalyst stability is discussed. Water vapour initiates the interaction between LiCI and Co304 due to LiCl hydrolysis, and thus mixed lithium-cobalt spinel oxides with a higher lithium content are obtained. At higher heating temperatures, there occurs a parallel process of extraction of Li' from the interstices of the spinel lattice under the effect of HCl and HZO from the reaction medium. Introduction The race to develop catalysts for oxidative coupling of methane during the past six years has led to an almost `universal' way to attain a high activity and selectivity: promotion of metal (alkali earth, transition and rare earth metal) oxides with alkali metal salts { 11. The reason for the universality of alkali promoters has not yet been elucidated. Systematic studies have been carried out mainly on alkali earth oxides, and the promoting effect of the alkali metals is found to consist of stabilization of the active sites (O- *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/92/$05.00 0 1992 - Elsevier Science Publishers BY. All rights reserved 344 radicals) [2], change in the acid-basic properties of the surface [3, 4] and alteration of the catalyst morphology [5, 6]. In addition, alkali metal additives can, in some cases, cause a drastic change in the catalytic action of the metal oxides. Thus, pure C030q is a wellknown catalyst for complete oxidation of CH4 to CO2, whereas the addition of alkali halides leads to a selective catalyst for oxidative coupling of methane [ 7, 8 ]. Among alkali halides, LiCl is found to be the most efficient [8]. According to Gratzel et al. [9], the anionic component most strongly affects the catalytic properties of the system: LiOH-Co304 has a much lower activity and selectivity than LiCl-Co304. The investigations performed so far have not revealed the reason for the change in catalytic properties of Co304 under the effect of alkali metal compounds. However, the catalytic performance of all lithium-promoted oxides is unstable during prolonged exploitation. In previous papers [ 10-12 ] we have shown that during interaction between Li2C03 and Co(N03)2 - 61120 in air at 500-750 C, mixed lithium-cobalt spinel oxides, Li,,Li,,C03-.04 (x and y referring to Li ions in sites and interstices of the spinel lattice, respectively), are formed. The cation distribution is: Co; xUx+{Liy}Co\"'_,,+yCo\"_J04, x+y<0.3 A i B A and B denote regular tetrahedral and octahedral spine] sites, respectively, while i stands for normally empty interstices. At 500 C x > y and at 750 C x = y [ 11, 12 ]. ESR spectroscopy is very sensitive to detecting small amounts of Li' in C0304 [ 12, 131. These results help clarify the effect of lithium compound additives on the catalytic properties of Co304. The present paper deals with the interactions between C030q and alkali promoters (LiCI and LiOH) during the catalyst preparation procedure and under the operating conditions. ESR signals for lithium-cobalt oxides Three kinds of ESR signal (denoted A, B and C for the sake of simplicity, Fig. 1) are registered in the spectra of lithium-cobalt oxides [ 12-14 [12-141. The antiferromagnetically coupled Co2+ ions in the tetrahedral A sites of the spinel lattice of Co304 and LiLixC03 _x04 cause the appearance of an isotropic signal with a Lorentzian shape and g = 2.25 (signal A) [ 13 ]. The linewidth of signal A (OHpp) depends strongly on the preparation conditions (time and temperature of heating) of pure C030q and on the amount and distribution of Li' in the spinel lattice [ 10, 111. At high temperatures (750 C), as a result of internal disorder reactions between Co\" (A) and interstitial Li; in LiLixCo3-x04, defect Co\" ions are stabilized in tetrahedral interstices of the spinel lattice [121. From these Co2+ ions, an anisotropic ESR signal with 3.5 < g 1, < 4 and g 1 = 2.00 (signal B) [ 12 ] originates. In addition, Ni3 + impurities in LiCO02 give a symmetrical Lorentzian singlet with g = 2.14 and AHpp = 4 mT (signal C) [ 14 ]. Signal C is observed even at about 0.05 at.% Ni, which permits its use as an ESR probe for detecting LiCo02 admixtures. 345 91.1 I signal B 7 gB 1 m D signa( C d ~ 9C ISO gA/' ISO signal A HPP -1 100 300 500 B (MT) Fig. 1. ESR signals for lithium-cobalt oxides. Experimental The initial Co304 sample was prepared by thermal decomposition of basic cobalt carbonate (A.R., Fluka) at 350 oC for 5 h. The Co304 thus obtained was impregnated by a solution (20 wt.%) of LiCl or LiOH, Li:Co being 2:8. (The lithium content in the samples was about the same as in the promoted Co304 catalysts tested for the reaction of oxidative coupling of methane (7-91.) The suspension was dried, and the solid residue was ground and heated in air for 2 to 20 h at 500, 600, 700 and 800 oC, respectively. Some of the samples (heating time 2 h at 500 and 700 oC, respectively)) were subjected to additional thermal treatment under water vapour (partial pressure in air 0.1 atm). The amount of lithium in the samples was determined by atomic absorption analysis using a Pye Unicam 182 spectrometer. The DTA and TG curves were recorded with a Paulik-Paulik-Erdey (Hungary) apparatus at 20-1000 oC and a heating rate of loo min-1. The standard used was A1203 calcined at 1500 oC. The surface areas of the samples were determined by low-temperature nitrogen adsorption. In order to eliminate the effect of unreacted LiCl or LiOH on the specific surface area values obtained, the samples were first rinsed with water. The ESR spectra were registered at 100 and 300 K with an ERS-220/ Q spectrometer (DAW, ex-G.D.R.) in the X-band. The g-factors were determined with respect to a Mn2+/ZnS standard. 346 The thermally programmed reduction experiments (TPR) were performed at 30-800 C with 5% H2/Ar, a heating rate of 10 min-1 and a volume rate of 60 ml min-1. A catharometer was used as gas detector. Results and discussion Phase composition of the LiCl--Co304 catalyst The DTA and TG curves of the LiCl-Co304 and LiOH-Co304 initial mixtures are compared in Fig. 2. Two identical endothermal effects are observed with both mixtures: dehydration of lithium chloride and lithium hydroxide, respectively, in the temperature range 100-200 C, and thermal decomposition of C030q to COO at temperatures above 800 C. The two mixtures exhibited differences within the temperature range 300-600 C: the LiOH-Co304 mixture displays a structureless endothermic effect due to interaction between the components, while LiCI-Co304 shows only the endothermic effect of melting of LiCI at 570 C. The different compositions of the cobalt spinels in the two samples are manifested by the different temperatures of their thermal decomposition: the decomposition temperature of the cobalt spinel in the LiCI-Co304 sample coincides with the decomposition temperature of pure C030q (920 C [11 ]), while for LiOH-Co304 this temperature is lower (850 C). In previous papers [11, 15] it was shown that the formation of mixed lithium-cobalt spinels leads to a drop in their thermal decomposition temperature compared with that of Co304. Thus, between 300 and 600 C, LiOH and C030q interact, a mixed lithium-cobalt spinel being formed, while no interaction between LiCl and C030q is established (from the thermal analysis data) over the whole temperature range investigated. As was mentioned in the Introduction, the interaction between Li' and C030q may be monitored by ESR.

DTA, TG and DTG curves for LiCI-Co304 and LiOH-Co304 mixtures. 347 LiOH-C0304 series exhibit all three types of signals (A, B and C, Fig. 1) as in the case of the mixed lithium-cobalt spinels prepared by a solid-state reaction between Li2C03 and Co(N03)2 - 6H20 [ 12-14]: the signal A linewidth and the signal C intensity increase with time and temperature, and at high temperatures signal B also appears. On the basis of our previous studies [ 10-14 ], these results indicate that the interaction between LiOH and Co304 results in the formation of a mixed lithium-cobalt spinel whose cation distribution changes with rising temperature from LiCo3-x04 (signal A) to Li,L1zCo3_x04 (signal B), small amounts or LiC002 (signal C) also being present. The latter increases in amount with the time and temperature of heating. Using data from [ 13 ], the lithium amount in the mixed lithium-cobalt spinels formed during the interaction of LiOH with C0304 may be estimated from the linewidth of signal A: (x + y) > 0.07 (more than 2.5 at.%) for all the samples investigated. In contrast to LiOH-Co304, the ESR spectra of the samples of the LiCl-C0304 series exhibit, irrespective of the temperature and time of heating, signal A only. Figure 3 presents a comparison of the changes in the linewidth OHpp of signal A for LiCI-CO304 and C0304 as a function of the time and temperature of heating. For Ci0304 OH,, decreases with rising heating temperature, while for the LiCI-Co304 samples OH,, increases. In addition, QHpp also depends on the heating time. This relationship is again different for the two types of sample: AHpp of signal A is slightly narrowed after prolonged heating Of Co304, and strongly widened when LiCl-Co304 is heated. According to Angelov et at. [ 13], for C0304 samples the linewidth of signal A decreases 350- 250- 20 10 150 0 550 650 750t)0 C)I 0450 Co LICL y 1 3' 2 550 650 750 t (OC) Fig. 3.

Heating time: 2 h. 348 with rising annealing temperature owing to recrystallization and annihilation of defects. The slight broadening of signal A for the LiCI-Co304 samples at 500 C (below the melting point of LiCl) compared with that for Co304 can be attributed to both the presence of small amounts of Li' m C0304 and the change in Co304 recrystallization when impregnated with LiCl. With a view to answering this question, the specific surface areas of Co304, LiCI-Co304 and LiOH-CO304 samples were measured (Fig. 4). Evidently, the specific surface areas of Co304 and lithium-cobalt spinels obtained by interaction of LiOH with C0304 are commensurate, while for the samples of the series LiCl-C0304 the specific surface areas of the cobalt spinels are lower. This indicates that Co304 recrystallizes differently when pure or impregnated with LiCl. The strong broadening of signal A with heating time for samples LiCI-Co304 at temperatures exceeding the melting point of LiCl cannot be ascribed to an altered crystallization process of the cobalt spine] alone. The most important factor for the broadening of signal A is the incorporation of Li' into the spinel structure. In addition, the amount of lithium in the spinel oxides formed increases with time and temperature of heating. Using data from [ 131, the lithium content for the LiCl-C0304 sample heated for 2 h at 700 C (catalyst preparation procedure as in [ 7-91) is: (x + y) = 0.01 (0.3 at.%), the maximum amount of lithium at 700 C for the samples investigated being (x+y) = 0.024 (0.8 at.%). Thus the amount of lithium in the cobalt spinel of samples LiCI-Co304 is much lower than the lithium content in the spinels of the series LiOH-Co30Q. According to the data of Gratzel et al. [91, when Co304 is promoted by LiOH, catalysts of lower selectivity and activity in the reaction of oxidative coupling of CH, are obtained than in the case of LiCl-promoted C0304Taking into account the values of the lithium content in the cobalt spinels of the series LiCl-Co304 and LiOH-Co304, respectively, this means that the promoting action of the lithium compounds toward C030q is due to surface effects rather than to formation of mixed lithium-cobalt spinels containing large lithium amounts or LiC002. As mentioned above, impregnation with LiCl reduces the specific surface area of the cobalt spinels. It is worth noting that in the case of alkali-promoted MgO catalysts, specific surface area reduction is also observed [5, 161. According to [51, alkali metal promoters lead to lattice distortion and surface area reduction of MgO, which favours the catalytic reaction of oxidative coupling of methane proceeding by a heterogeneous-homogeneous mechanism. The reducibility of LiCl-C0304 provides further information about the surface modification of Co304 by LiCl. Figure 5 shows the TPR curves of Co304 (curve (1)), a LiCl-C0304 catalyst heated for 2 h at 700 C (curve (2)) and the latter sample after being rinsed with water to eliminate unreacted LiCl (curve (3)). The reduction Of Co304 proceeds within the temperature range 300-500 C to cobalt metal through the formation of the intermediate COO. The reaction product of the other two samples is cobalt metal again, but the TPR curves show changes in peak shape and position.

After elimination of the LiCl layer, the TPR curve moves toward the reduction temperature of pure Co304, the presence of small amounts of lithium in the cobalt spinel and the modified spinel morphology being reflected in the change in the shape of the curve. Stability of the LiCb-C0304 catalyst in a water vapour medium Water vapour is a reaction product in the oxidative coupling of methane. In order to investigate the stability of LiCl-Co304 catalysts under the operating conditions, we have traced the effect of water vapour on the catalyst phase composition. Figure 6 shows the changes in the total amount of lithium in the LiCI-C0304 samples as a function of the heating time in air and presence or absence of water vapour. Obviously, at 500 C in air the amount of lithium does not change with time of heating, while in the presence of water vapour the lithium content decreases. At 700 C the amount of lithium drops irrespective of the reaction medium, this drop being more pronounced in water vapour. On the basis of data from [ 171, above 500 C and in the presence of water vapour, lithium chloride decomposes according to the reaction LiCl + H20 - LiOH + HCI. The difference between the volatilities of the two lithium compounds explains the decrease in the total lithium content of the samples heated in a water-vapour-containing medium. In view of the reactivity of LiOH toward Co304, a change in the phase composition of the LiCI-Co304 catalyst under water vapour might be expected. 350 E is a n x a 2 300 250 2a 200 1 150 0 5 10 15 20 HEATING TIME I h 1 Fig. 7.

Registration temperature: 100 K. Figure 7 shows the changes in linewidth of ESR signal A for the LiCl-Co304 samples obtained within 2 h at 500 and 700 C, respectively, as a function of the time. of heating in water vapour containing air. At 500 C, OHpp initially increases strongly and then remains practically unchanged, while at 700 C AHpp shows almost no alteration until the 10th hour, after which it decreases. In addition, at 700 C, regardless of the heating time, the linewidth of signal A for the samples heated under water vapour is smaller than that for samples obtained in air. The pronounced broadening of signal A at 500 C under water vapour indicates an interaction between hydrolized LiCl and Co304, the reaction product being a mixed lithium-cobalt spinel. Unlike the samples heated at 500 C, at 700 C the decrease in linewidth of signal A after the 10th hour of heating in water vapour shows that an extraction of Li' ions from the spinel lattice takes place. This can be explained by taking into account the different chemical properties of Li' when occupying spinel sites (Li,) or interstices (Lip) [ 11 ]: Li, can be extracted in acids (in this case, under the effect of HCl and H20 in the reaction medium) with the spinel crystal structure being preserved. Thus the water vapour initiates phase composition changes in the LiCI-Co304 catalyst. Conclusions The promoting effect of lithium compounds toward Co304 is associated with surface effects and not with the formation of Li-Co oxide phases such as LiCo02 or mixed lithium-cobalt spinels. LiCl leads to morphological 351 changes in the cobalt spinel oxide and forms a dense layer over the spinel crystallites. The instability of the catalyst under the operating conditions is a result of phase composition changes and enhanced lithium evaporation due to LiCl hydrolysis. References I Y. Amenomiya, V.

Water vapour initiates the interaction between LiCl and Co3O4 due to LiCl hydrolysis, and thus mixed lithium—cobalt spinel oxides with a higher lithium content are obtained. At higher heating temperatures, there occurs a parallel process of extraction of Li+ from the interstices of the spinel lattice under the effect of HCl and H2O from the reaction medium.

        "dc:description": "The interaction between the components of LiClo3O4 and LiOHCo3O4 catalysts for oxidative coupling of methane has been studied by ESR, TPR and specific surface area measurements. The interaction between Co3O4 and LiCl begins at temperatures higher than the melting point of LiCl, lithium—cobalt spinels with a low lithium content (about 0.03 at.%) being obtained. Lithium—cobalt spinels with a much higher lithium content (more than 2.5 at.%) and a LiCoO2 phase are obtained from Co3O4 and LiOH. The higher activity and selectivity of LiClCo3O4 for oxidative coupling of methane in comparison with LiOHCo3O4 are related to surface effects rather than to formation of mixed LiCo oxide phases. LiCl modifies spinel morphology and forms a dense layer over the spinel crystallites. The effect of water vapour (a reaction product of the oxidative coupling of methane) on the catalyst stability is discussed. Water vapour initiates the interaction between LiCl and Co3O4 due to LiCl hydrolysis, and thus mixed lithium—cobalt spinel oxides with a higher lithium content are obtained.
