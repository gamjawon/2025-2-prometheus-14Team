A. VIKULOV, I. V. ELEV, B. N. SHELIMOV* and V. B. KAZANSKY N. D. Zeiinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry, USSR Academy of Sciences, Moscow 117913 (U.S.S.R.) Summary Cyclopropane (CP) chemisorption on silica-molybdena catalysts pho- toreduced in CO was found to result in a sharp increase (by more than one order of magnitude at 293 K) of specific activities for propene metathesis. IR and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopic studies revealed that the pro- moting effect of CP treatment was associated with the formation of surface carbene species \\ ^CH2 .MO. ^-Si O^ D Si-^ arising from CP interaction with low coordinated Mo4'1' ions produced by photoreduction of Mo^/SiOg in CO. Such carbenes (Mo==CH2) are found to be thermally stable in vacua up to 650 - 700 K, oxygen resistant at 293 K and to react with water vapour at ~400K to yield CH4. The IR data obtained showed fast reversible transformation of Mo=CHz to Mo^CDg after CzD4 admission. In addition to Mo^CHg, the spectroscopic data indicate the formation of ethylene and propene n -complexes with Mo44^ ions and Mo cyclobutanes during CP chemisorption. Ethylene adsorbed on Mo4'1' ions gave rise to Ti-complexes and possibly Mo-cyclopentane species. A general scheme for CP interaction with photoreduced Mo^/StOg explaining all the spectroscopic data obtained, the composition of the thermally desorbed products and the promoting effect of CP chemisorption on metathesis is presented and discussed. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 127 Introduction It is generally accepted at present that the catalytic olefin metathesis reaction proceeds via a chain mechanism, involving intermediate carbene complexes with transition metal ions (mainly, Mo, W and Re) [1-6]. It is also known that during the metathesis process metallocyclobutane intermediates and olefinic n -complexes with metal ions are formed as well. These three types of species are key intermediates which interconvert to each other at different stages of the metathesis reaction [2-6]. Most convincingly, the participation of these intermediates in metathesis has been demonstrated for homogeneous catalytic systems. Later this concept was extended on heteroge- neous metathesis, and, in particular, to molybdena-containing oxide catalysts [7, 8]. However, to date, there is no direct evidence for the validity of such an extention, i.e. no straightforward spectroscopic evidence exists for the forma- tion of carbenes, metallocyclobutanes and other complexes on the surface of heterogeneous catalysts active for olefin metathesis. As far as we are aware, the only exception is our previous work [9], in which the interaction of cyclopropane (CP) with Mo4+ ions, produced by the photoreduction of silica-molybdena catalysts (Mo^/SiOg) in CO, was studied using UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and temperature pro- grammed desorption. As previously reported [10] and recently confirmed [II], Mo^ ions are the major product of the photoreduction of Mo64^ ions supported on silica in CO at molybdenum loadings ofca. 1 wt.%. It has been suggested [9] that CP is strongly chemisorbed on the photoreduced Mo4'1' ions at room temperature, forming a molybdenacyclobutane intermediate which is partially decomposed at this temperature to yield carbenes of the type Mo==CH2 and olefinic re-complexes with Mo4'1'. Such carbenes (Mo^CHg) were found to be thermally stable up to ~ 700 K, oxygen resistant at 293 K and characterized by an absorption band at 450 - 480 nm in the UV-vis optical spectrum. The fraction of Mo=CHs attained approx 70% of the total Mo4+ content in the sample. In a parallel study [12], a drastic enhancement in catalytic activity in propene and hex-1-ene metathesis was found for the photoreduced Mo^/SiOg catalysts after CP chemisorption. In the present work we have attempted to obtain more reliable evidence for the formation of Mo=CH2 carbenes and Mo cyclobutanes as a reasult of CP interaction with photoreduced Mo^/SiOg, using a combination ofIR and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopies, and to establish the role of these species in propene metathesis over photoreduced catalysts. Experimental Experiments were carried out with Mo6+/Si02 (0.08, 1.0 or 2.5 wt.% Mo) samples prepared by impregnation of KSK-2-5 silica gel (S = 250 - 270 m2 g~1, pore volume 0.8 cm3 g~1, particle size 0.1 - 0.3 mm) with an aqueous solution 128 of(NH4)eMo7024 of appropriate concentration. The samples were dried in air at 350 - 370 K and then calcined at 773 K in an oxygen flow. Further pretreatment of the Mo^/SiOg samples for subsequent optical measurement was performed in quartz cells, connected by a side arm fitted with IR-transparent CaFg windows. The cells were attached to a greaseless vacuum system and samples were heated in dry oxygen (100 Torr) at 1073 K for 1.5 - 2.0 h and then outgassed (~ 10\"''Ton') for 2.0 h at the same temperature. Photoreduction of Mo6+/SiO;i in CO (10 - 30 Torr) was carried out at room temperature by irradiation with a high-pressure 1 kW mercury lamp for 1.5 - 3.0 h. The average oxidation state of molybdenum in such photoreduced samples, as determined by measuring the number of COg molecules evolved during irradiation, was in the range 4.7 - 4.8. After photoreduction, the samples were outgassed at 423 - 473 K to remove any chemisorbed carbon monoxide. For measurements of the catalytic activity in propene metathesis, a portion of the Mo6+/Si02 catalyst (0.003 - 0.3 g) was placed in a quartz reactor connected to an evacuable gas-circulating system, and then submitted to pretreatment and photoreduction as described above. The catalytic activities of photoreduced samples for propene metathesis were measured at 202 - 293 K by circulation of the gas mixture through the catalyst. The total reaction volume was 580 cm3, the initial propene pressures were in the range 70 - 720 Torr. The gas-phase compositions were analyzed quantitatively using a UTI-100C quadrupole mass spectrometer. Metathesis rates were calculated by applying the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model to the kinetic data, as described previously [13]. The carbon monoxide used in this study was purified by passage through a trap cooled with liquid nitrogen and a column with reduced Cr^/SiOz adsorbent. CP, ethylene and propene were purified by repeated freeze-pump- thaw cycles before each run. The deuterium content in C2D4 was >97%. The IR spectra of the catalysts were measured with a Perkin-Elmer 580B instrument, using a home-made attachment for diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. For such measurements, the powder samples inside the quartz cells were transferred to the side arm with attached CaFg windows. In order to reduce light absorption by the silica support over the 2000 - 2200 cm\"1 region, samples diluted by CaFz powder (Si02:CaF2= 1:1) were used. The spectral resolution was ca. 10 cm\"1. Diffuse reflectance spectra in the UV-vis range (200 - 850 nm) were recorded using an MgO pellet as a reference with a Hitachi M-340 spectrometer supplied with an integrating sphere attachment. ESR spectra were recorded at 77 K with an X-band ESR spectrometer. Results Interaction of CP with Mo*+ ions The IR spectrum of the original photoreduced Mo^/StOg catalyst exib- ited no absorption bands in the C H stretching vibration region [Fig. l(a)]. 129 Fig. 1. IR spectra ofMo/SiOa sample (a) photoreduced in CO at 293 K and outgasged at 473 K; (b) after CP admission (P = 1 Torr) on to sample (a) at 293 K; (c) after evacuation of sample (b) at 293 K; and (d) after evacuation of sample (c) at 620 K. In the UV-vis spectrum of the same sample, however, three absorption bands with maxima at 780, 630 and 350 nm, assigned earlier (10,14] to the d-d transitions in coordinatively unsaturated Mo4'1' ions (d^configuration), were observed [Fig. 2(a)]. After CP adsorption at room temperature (at a final CP pressure of 1 Torr), a rather complex IR spectrum was obtained in the C H stretch region [Fig. l(b)] showing absorption bands at 3100, 2985, 2930 and 2870cm\"1, and shoulders at 3080 and 3020 cm~1. In the UV-vis spectrum, the band arising from the Mo44' d-d transitions disappeared and a broad band centred near 480 nm appeared [Fig. 2(b)]. In the gas phase, some ethylene (14%) was found mass spectroscopically in addition to CP. Parallel ESR measurements showed that the intensity of the M.o6^ ion signal observed in the original sample [10,14] remained unchanged. In- creasing the CP pressure in the gas phase resulted in a relative enhance- ment of absorption bands at 3100 and 3020cm\"1 in the IR spectrum, which could be assigned to the C H vibrations in the physically adsorbed molecules [15]. 130 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 A \"I111 Fig. 2. UV-vis spectra of Mo/SiO^ sample (a) photoreduced in CO and outgassed at 473 K; (b) after CP admission (P = 1 Torr) on to sample (a) at 293 K; (c) after evacuation of sample (b) at 293 K; (d) after evacuation of sample (c) at 620 K; and (e) after oxidation of sample (d) by 0^ (P = 1 Torr, 1 min, 293 K). After outgassing the sample with adsorbed CP at room temperature, the IR spectrum exhibited four absorption bands at 3080, 2985, 2945 and 2870 cm\"1 [Fig. l(c)], while in the UV-vis spectrum two bands were observed at 450 and 590 nm [Fig. 2(c)]. The latter spectrum has been discussed earlier [9] and the 450 nm band attributed to carbenes of the type Mo=CH2, while the 590 nm band has been assigned to re-complexes of ethylene and propene with Mo4'1' ions. After outgassing the sample at 620 K its IR spectrum was considerably simplified [Fig. l(d)]: it now consisted of only two bands at 3080 and 2945cm\"1, whose intensities were somewhat smaller than those recorded in Fig. l(c). After such treatment, the UV-vis bands of n-complexes completely disappeared, whereas the band for Mo4\"1' ions reappeared [Fig. 2(d)]. The absorption band for Mo=CH;i at 450 nm remained virtually unchanged. Thus, we may attribute the 3080 and 2945 cm\"! band to the Mo==CH2 species (see also Discussion Section below). As previously demonstrated mass-spectro- scopically [9], the products of thermal desorption consisted of S?95% C2H4, 4-5% CsHg (propene + CP) and <1% C4Hg. 131 Interaction of C<^H^ and C^D^ with Mo=CH^ As reported previously [9], the Mo4'1' ions remaining in the sample with chemisorbed CP after outgassing at 620 K could be easily oxidized by Og at 293 K. Correspondingly, the Mo*+ d-d transition bands completely disap- peared [Fig. 2(e)], while the Mo=CH^ bands at 450 nm (UV-vis) and 3080 and 2945 cm\"1 (IR) remained about the same, thus confirming our previous conclusion [9] on the stability of these species to oxygen molecules. After ethylene admission to the oxidized sample (PC^ = 0.5 Torr), new IR bands at 2985, 2930 and 2870 cm-1 were observed [Fig. 3(b)], while the intensities of the bands at 3080 and 2945 cm-1 decreased considerably. At ethylene pres- sures of 1 Torr, the 3080 and 2945cm\"1 bands virtually disappeared com- pletely, whereas the 2985, 2930 and 2870cm\"1 bands increased in intensity and a shoulder appeared at 2955 cm\"! [Fig. 3(c)]. The UV-vis band at 450 nm broadened and its maximum shifted to 480 - 490 nm. At ethylene pressures greater than 1 Torr, absorption bands at 3100 and 3010 cm~1 were detected in the IR spectrum, which are associated with physically adsorbed C^}i^ molecules. Evacuation of the sample at 293 K restored the bands at 3080 and 2945 cm~1 [Fig. 3(d)] and the 450 nm band in the UV-vis spectrum. These data indicate that reversible adsorption of ethylene occurs on Mo^CHg followed by the formation of species identical to those observed at the initial stages of CP chemisorption [Fig. l(c)]. Fig. 3. IR spectra of Mo/SiO^ sample (a) as in Fig. 2(d); (b) after CgH^ admission on to sample (a) (P = 0.5 Torr) at 293 K; (c) the same as (b), but at a C^ pressure of 1.0 Torr; and (d) after evacuation of sample (c) at 293 K. 132 Fig. 4. IR spectra of Mo/SiOa sample (a) photoreduced in CO at 293 K and outgassed at 473 K; (b) after CP adsorption on sample (a) and outgaasing at 293 K; (c) after evacuation of sample (b) at 620 K and oxygen treatment at 293 K; (d) after CgD, admission on to sample (c) (10 Ton\", 10 min) and evacuation at 293 K; and (e) after Cyfl^ admission on to sample (d) (lOTorr, 10 min) and evacuation at 293 K. Subsequent treatment of the catalyst having the spectrum illustrated in Fig. 3(d) with CaD4 led to complete substitution of the IR absorption bands of Mo==CH2 at 3080 and 2945 cm\"1 by those characteristic of a CDg stretch at 2245 and 2160 cm\"1 [Fig. 4(d)]. Hence, the exchange reaction (ethylene metathesis): Mo==CH2 + DaC=CD2 ;= Mo==CD2 + HgC^Da could be followed spectroscopically. Subsequent treatment of the deuterated catalyst with CsjHL, under the same conditions restored the initial spectrum of Mo==CH;i [Fig. 4(e)]. No IR spectral bands corresponding to OD groups were observed after C^D^ treatment. Interaction of C^H^ with Mo4+ ions As shown earlier [9,13], ethylene and propene chemisorb strongly at 293 K on Mo44^ ions in photoreduced catalysts, giving rise to an intense broad absorption band with a maximum in the UV-vis absorption spectrum at 590 nm and a less intense band at 380 nm [Fig. 5(b)].

Mo^/SiOa with adsorbed ethylene exhibits four bands at 3060, 2975, 2930 and 2870 cm\"1 [Fig. 6(b)]. After outgassing the sample at higher temperatures (T ^ 473 K), the intensities of all the bands gradually diminished, those of the 3060 and 2975 cm\"1 bands decreasing faster than the other two. At 573 K, the absorption bands at 3060 and 2975 cm~1 disappeared completely [Fig. 6(d)]. A similar behaviour was shown by the 590 nm bands in the UV-vis spectrum [Fig. 5(c,d)], with the Mo4+ d-d transition bands being restored in this latter spectrum. The products obtained on thermal desorption were ethylene (90.8%) and propene (9.0%) [9]. In conclusion, it should be noted that attempts were made to detect some absorption bands for Mo4+/Si02 with chemisorbed CP and ethylene in the IR region below 2800 cm~1 (in particular, Mo=C and C=C stretches and C H bending vibrations). However such attempts were unsuccessful proba- bly due to the strong background absorption of the silica support below 2000cm-1. The results of the IR and UV-vis studies of Mo4+/Si02 are summarized in Table 1. 134 -), cm-' 3200 3000 2800 Fig. 6. IR spectra of Mo/SiOg sample (a) photoreduced in CO at 293 K and outgassed at 473 K; (b) after C,iH^ adsorption on sample (a) and outgassing at 293 K; (c) after evacuation of sample (b) at 473 K; and (d) after evacuation of sample (c) at 573 K. Interaction of other molecules with Mo=CH^ Carbenes of the type Mo==CH2 react with water vapour at ~400K forming CH4. No reaction was found to occur when Mo=CH2 contacted hydrogen at T ^ 473 K or acetone at 300 K. As mentioned above, Mo=CHa species are stable in the presence of oxygen at 293 K and could be oxidized at higher temperatures. Effect of CP chemisorption on the activities of photoreduced Mo^/SlOg catalysts for propene metathesis As reported in our earlier work [13], photoreduced Mo^/SiOg samples showed high catalytic activity in the propene metathesis reaction. Under our typical experimental conditions (T = 293 K, P^Hg =75-85 Torr, reaction vol- ume 580cm3, catalyst sample weight 0.1-0.2 g, Mo loading 1 wt.%), the equilibrium propene fraction in the reaction mixture was reached within 7 -10 min. This corresponds to a specific activity (turnover number, TON) ~0.4 C3Hg molecule (Mo atom)\"1 s~1 (Table 2). It turned out, however, that the activities of the photoreduced catalysts increased considerably after CP chemisorption at 293 K and subsequent evacuation at 293 - 620 K. With the CP treated catalysts, the equilibrium propene fraction was reached in less than ~30s (time required for a single mass-spectroscopic analysis), and hence correct measurements of the reaction rates were not possible. In an attempt to obtain measurable metathesis rates, the reaction temperature was decreased to 203 K and the propene pressure increased to 680 Torr. However neither attempt was successful (Table 2). Only when the molybdenum loading in the catalyst was diminished to 0.08 wt.% and the catalyst weight to 0.0035 g was it possible to measure the metathesis rates (Table 2).

Nevertheless, it is evident from the data in Table 2 that CP treatment resulted in a sharp increase (by more than one order of magnitude) in the specific activities of the Mo4+/Si02 catalysts with the high selectivity (close to 100%) being preserved. CP treatment made photoreduced Mo^/SiOg catalysts essentially more stable to oxygen poisoning. In contrast to untreated Mo^/SiOg which were completely deactivated by adsorption of small amounts of oxygen at 293 K (comparable with the number of Mo4\"'' ions in the sample) [13], exposure of a CP-treated catalyst to 100 Torr Oz at 293 K resulted in a decrease in activity by only a factor of ~1.5 (Table 2). These data correlate quite well with the stability of Mo=CH2 and the IR and UV-vis absorption bands in the presence of oxygen. 138 TABLE 2 Effect of CP treatment on the catalytic activities of photoreduced Mo^/SiO^ catalysts for propene metathesis\" Mo in catalysts (wt.%) CP treatment1' Reaction temperature (K) Initial propene pressure (Torr) Specific activities A [gCaHe (g catalyst)\"1 s-1] TON [C3He molecules (Moat)-'s-1] 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 (unreduced) 0.08 0.08 0.08 No No Yes Yes YesYes No Yes Yes [Extra treatment in Og (lOOTorr) at 293 K] 293 263 293 203 293293 293 293293 85 79 86 70 68079 102 320345 1.8 x 10-3 9.6 x 10-4c cNo activity 1.4 x 10-4 3.2 x 10-22.1 x 10-2 0.42 0.22C Cc0.44 9563 \"Photoreduced in CO for 1.5 h.

Discussion The carbene complex Mo=CH^ The IR data obtained confirm our earlier conclusion [9] on the forma- tion of carbenes of the type Mo==CH2 as a result of CP chemisorption on to Mo^/StOg. The IR absorption bands at 3080 and 2945 cm-1 (Table 1, samples 4 and 5) may be attributed to the respective asymmetric and symmetric C H stretching vibrations of the Mo^CHg species. The band positions agree with those established by matrix isolation FT-IR spectroscopic studies of Fe^CHg (3011.5 and 2941.6cm-!) [16], Zn=CH;; (3047.2 and 2956.1cm-1) [17] and Cu=CH2 (3034.7 and 2960.7cm-1) [18] carbene complexes. It should be emphasized that Mo=CHa species already exist after CP chemisorption at 293 K. This is demonstrated by the appearance of bands at 3080 and 2945 cm-1 in the IR spectrum and at 450 nm in the UV-vis spectrum (Table 1, sample 3). These conclusions regarding the stabilization of Mo^CHg species on the surface of Mo^/SiOg are further confirmed by a sharp increase in the specific catalytic activities (TON) of CP-treated catalysts in propene metathe- sis and in the 'degenerate' metathesis of C^fl^ + C^D^ mixtures. IR data 139 demonstrate the fast substitution of Mo=CH2 bands by those of Mo^CDg after C^D^ treatment (Table 1) as well as the reversibility of this process on subsequent admission of Cytl^ (Table 1, sample 9). This may be regarded as direct spectroscopic evidence for the occurrence of 'degenerate' ethylene metathesis via the carbene mechanism: Mo=CH2+D2C==CD2 <= Mo=CD2+H2C=CD2 The carbenes Mo=CHg when adsorbed on to a silica surface display some striking properties which are not characteristic of other known reac- tive carbene complexes. First of all, the high thermal stability of Mo^CHa species (they do not decompose in vacua at temperatures up to 620 K) and their stability to oxidation (Table 1, sample 5) should be emphasized. Hydrogenation of Mo^CHg is an apparently energetically unfa- vourable process, since it would be accompanied by regeneration of low coordinated Mo*^ ions (in addition to CH4 formation). This might explain why Mo=CH2 does not react with H^. Methane evolution occurs when Mo=CH2 is contacted with water vapour at ~ 400 K, indicating that the following reaction occurs: 0 CH2 00 ^ // \\ // Mo +HaO . Mo +CH4 00 00 II II Si Si Si Si /1\\ /1\\ /1\\ /1\\ This process seems to be more favourable energetically because of the high exothermicity of Mo*+ oxidation to Mo6-1- (395kJmol-1 at 473 K [19]). It is suggested that interaction of Mo^CHa with acetone (Wittig-like reaction) which was found for carbenes Cl =C/ _ on the surface of Phillips NKg catalysts (Cr/SiOg) [20] does not occur, probably due to energetic reasons once more. Molybdenacyclobutane complexes Spectroscopic data (Table 1, samples 6 and 7) indicate that interaction of ethylene with Mo=CHz proceeds reversibly via the formation of a new species, probably the unstable molybdenacyclobutane complex: . w' \\ n Mo +H2C=CH2 ^= Mo 1 ,i ' ,* ^i 0 0 Si^ ^-Si 0 0 Si^ The product is an active intermediate in the 'degenerate' ethylene metathesis. 140 The band positions in the IR spectrum of Mo cyclobutane (2985, 2955 (sh), 2930 and 2870 cm\"1) agree well with the IR spectra for various cyclobu- tanes with the heteroatoms 0 [21], S [22], Se [23] and Si [24], which exhibit three intense bands in the C H stretch region at 3000 - 2970, 2958 - 2930 and 2890-2850 cm-!. The same set of IR bands and UV-vis bands at 480 - 490 nm were observed after CP adsorption at 293 K on photoreduced Mo^/SiOg (Table 1, sample 2), i.e. under these conditions Mo4'1\" ions interact with CP to yield Mo-cyclobutane species: 0 CH^ ^ [ I / < MoJ Mo + / \\ > Mo- ^-(/ \\o-Si( H-C CH. ^/ \\^ It is possible that after evacuation of the catalyst at 293 K (Table 1, sample 3) Mo cyclobutanes partially survived, since the IR absorption bands at 2985 and 2870 cm\"1 may still be detected. It cannot be ruled out, however, that these bonds may be attributable to some other species (for example, to complexes of propene and Mo*+ ions). Hence no definite conclusions regard- ing the presence of Mo-cyclobutanes in the outgassed catalysts can be drawn. Interaction of ethylene with Mo44\" ions The behaviour of the 3060 and 2975 cm~1 bands in the IR spectrum of Mo^/SiOg with the presence of adsorbed CzH4 (Table 1, samples 10 and 11) during vacuum treatment at elevated temperatures correlates with that of the UV-vis 590 nm band (Figs. 5 and 6). The latter was attributed to a charge- transfer band arising from n-complexes of C2H4 with Mo44^ ions [9]. The relatively high C H stretch frequencies typical of ethylene n-complexes confirm this assignment [25 - 27]. The two absorption bands at 2930 and 2870 cm~1 illustrated in Fig. 6(b) correspond to the C H stretch in alkanes [28]. A decrease in the band intensities by evacuation at higher temperatures [Fig. 6(c,d)] indicates that they can hardly be assigned to the CHg stretch in polyethylene or long-chain ethylene oligomers. It is more likely that thermally unstable molybdenacy- clopentane complexes of Mo44^ ions with two 114 molecules are formed, since the positions of the C H absorption bands in Fig. 6(d) are consistent with those which are known for some cyclopentanes containing heteroatoms such as 0, S, Se or Te [29, 30]. It is also possible that the UV-vis band at 380 nm [Fig. 5(b)] corresponds to Mo-cyclopentane complexes. Interaction of CP with Mo4+ ions at 293 K The spectra observed after CP chemisorption on Mo^/SiO^ followed by outgassing of the sample at 293 K (Table 1, sample 3) are most difficult to interpret because of the overlapping of several bands associated with various species. The presence of bands associated with Mo=CH2 (3080, 2945 cm\"1 and 141 450 nm) provides evidence for dissociative CP adsorption even at 293 K. On the other hand, the bands at 2985, 2870 cm\"1 and 590 nm disappear after evacuation of the sample at 620 K, indicating the thermal unstability of the corresponding species. It is probable that these bands belong to several types of species. That at 590 nm should be assigned to Tt-complexes of ethylene and propene, which are the decomposition and isomerization products of CP at 293 K. The IR spectra of Mo^-CaF^ w-complexes have been described above (Table 1, sample 10). Unfortunately, no distinct bands at 3060 and 2975 cm~1 occur in the spectra illustrated in Fig. l(c), although the presence of such bands cannot be ruled out since those of Mo4+-C2H4 could be masked by the more intense bands of Mo=CHa at 3080 and 2945 cm\"1. The IR spectra of propene adsorbed on Mo^/SiOa exhibit a large number of absorption bands (some are likely to be due to metathesis products), among which the intense bands at 2985 and 2870 cm\"l [see Fig. l(c)] could be distinguished. However, these bands could be attributed to Mo-cyclobutane complexes, whose IR and UV-vis spectra have also been discussed above. A general scheme for CP interaction with photoreduced Mo*^ jSiOy, catalysts Such a scheme should explain the following body of experimental results: 1. All the IR and UV-vis spectra, obtained at any stage of CP chemisorption (Table 1). 2. The sharp increase in metathesis catalytic activity after CP chemisorption on Mo'*+/Si02 at 293 K followed by subsequent out- gassing of the catalysts at higher temperatures. 3. The appearance of gaseous ethylene after CP chemisorption at 293 K and the predominance of ethylene among the products obtained on thermal desorption. 4. A decrease in the concentration of Mo=CHa after evacuation of the catalyst with adsorbed CP at 620 K. 5. The high sensitivity of Mo^/SiOz catalysts to oxygen poisoning before CP treatment and their low sensitivity to Og after CP treat- ment. 6. Two maxima (at 550 and 580 K) in the thermal desorption curves obtained for catalysts promoted by CP at 293 K [9]. 7. No change in the intensity of the MoB+ EPR signals after CP chemisorption and subsequent thermal desorption treatment. Scheme 1 illustrates a general scheme for CP interaction with Mo4'1'/ SiOg; it appears to provide a good explanation of all the experimental data obtained. It is based on a set of Mo-containing species, which have been detected spectroscopically (Table 1), and explains a sharp increase in the metathesis catalytic activity by the formation of thermally stable and oxygen- resistant Mo==CHa carbenes. Chemisorption of CP on to paired Mo4+ ions [reaction (3)] explains most logically the formation of Mo^CHg at 293 K, followed by evolution of At 293 K At 293 K 0. /CH, ^McT + H;,C=CH:;t 0 A\" /\\ ^ ^Mo^ + / \\ > >N0 \\) 01 1 1Si Si Si /1\\ /1\\ /1\\0 /N 11 A 11,/Mo. + / \\ + ^-Mo 0^ ^0 i -> 0Si Si Si /|\\ /1\\ /1\\ do- * ^01s /\\^01Si /1\\ ^0^ \"1^ /-T0^0/Si /^-(?Si /1\\H^C Ci / \\ H >M\\Mo:>3i 1\\ 01/1\\^ K /^CH-C -0Si /\\\\/CHz . ^CH ^0Si /1\\Mo^ + ^0Si /1\\ ^3^-CH, ,0 ^ , ^Mo^ 0^ ^0 ISi Sij /1\\ /1\\H2C-^ O./'CH,,;Mo^ 0 ^01 1 Si Si /1\\ /1\\ At 293-620 K H,C 0^ '/'CH-CH3 >Mo. 0 I Si /1\\ '0 Si /1\\ 0 11 ^Mo. + H2C=CH-CH3t 0 ^0 I I Si Si /1\\ /1\\ At 293- 620 K >Mo^ 2 + H^CH-CHa ?= ^>Mo^ 0-^ ^0 0^ ^0 Si Si /1\\ /1\\ Si Si /1\\ /1\\ + C2H4t H2C^ 0. ^CH, >Mo^ 0 ^0 I I Si Si /1\\ /1\\ H2C^ 0, /\"-CHs A ( 293- 620 K ^Mo^ 0' ^0 Si Si /1\\ /1\\ 0 II ^Mo\\ + H2C=CH2t Si Si /1\\ /1\\ Scheme 1. General scheme for CP interaction with Mo /SiO;. 144 only small amounts of gaseous ethylene. The predominance of ethylene among the thermal desorption products (point 3 above) means that there are some potential ethylene sources in the catalysts derived from chemisorbed CP. These could be Mo-cyclobutane complexes, ethylene and propene TT-com- plexes, which decompose at higher temperatures according to reactions (1), (4), (5) and (6). Reactions (4) - (6) explain the decrease in the intensity of the IR absorption bands for Mo=CH2 during thermal desorption (point 4) and the two maxima in the thermal desorption curve (point 6). Finally, we believe that the low sensitivity of the CP-treated catalysts to 0^ (point 5) is associ- ated with the much higher stability of Mo^CHg carbenes to oxidation as compared to that of Mo4'1' ions in non-promoted catalysts. Conclusions We have reported in this paper the first spectroscopic observation of a methylene carbene complex on the surface of solid catalysts which is active for the metathesis reaction. In our opinion, the IR and UV-vis data pre- sented, as well as the high catalytic activities of the CP-treated Mo^/SiOg samples for propene metathesis, clearly support Mo^CHg formation. It should be stressed, however, that spectroscopic detection of Mo==CH2 and other organomolybdenum species was only successful for photoreduced Mo44' /SiOg samples in which the major portion of the Mo6+ ions have been converted selectively to Mo44^ ions through low-temperature photoreduction in CO. In contrast, high-temperature non-selective thermal reduction of Mo^/SiOg in CO or Hg yielded a mixture of molybdenum species with various coordination and valence states. This is probably why attempts to detect some organomolybdenum species spectroscopically after CP adsorption failed. This work demonstrates that all of the three key intermediates partici- pating in the metathesis reaction (Mo^CHz, Mo cyclobutane and re-com- plexes with Mo4'1') as well as their transformation products could be identified spectroscopically. Although CP interaction with Mo*+ ions at 293 K was complicated by the formation of several kinds of species, never- theless by applying a particular sequence of treatments we have succeeded in producing Mo/SiOg catalysts containing only surface carbenes Mo==CH2 and exhibiting high activity for propene metathesis. Finally, it must be emphasized that all of the stages of the simplest metathesis reaction 'degenerate' metathesis of a C^fl^-C^D^ mixture, i.e. CH^ CD^ Mo=CH2+D2C=DC2 T^- Mo CD2 <=t Mo=CD2+H2C==CD2 may be followed by IR spectroscopy, with the Mo=CH2 and Mo=CD2 carbenes, as well as Mo cyclobutane, being detected. 145 References 1 J.

Cyclopropane (CP) chemisorption on silica-molybdena catalysts photoreduced in CO was found to result in a sharp increase (by more than one order of magnitude at 293 K) of specific activities for propene metathesis. IR and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopic studies revealed that the promoting effect of CP treatment was associated with the formation of surface carbene species arising from CP interaction with low coordinated Mo4+ ions produced by photoreduction of Mo6+/SiO2 in CO. Such carbones (MoCH2) are found to be thermally stable in vacuo up to 650 – 700 K, oxygen resistant at 293 K and to react with water vapour at ~400K to yield CH4. The IR data obtained showed fast reversible transformation of MoCH2 to MoCD2 after C2D4 admission. In addition to MoCH2, the spectroscopic data indicate the formation of ethylene and propene π -complexes with Mo4+ ions and Mo cyclobutanes during CP chemisorption. Ethylene adsorbed on Mo4+ ions gave rise to π-complexes and possibly Mo-cyclopentane species. A general scheme for CP interaction with photoreduced Mo4+/SiO2 explaining all the spectroscopic data obtained, the composition of the thermally desorbed products and the promoting effect of CP chemisorption on metathesis is presented and discussed.

        "dc:description": "Cyclopropane (CP) chemisorption on silica-molybdena catalysts photoreduced in CO was found to result in a sharp increase (by more than one order of magnitude at 293 K) of specific activities for propene metathesis. IR and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopic studies revealed that the promoting effect of CP treatment was associated with the formation of surface carbene species arising from CP interaction with low coordinated Mo4+ ions produced by photoreduction of Mo6+/SiO2 in CO. Such carbones (MoCH2) are found to be thermally stable in vacuo up to 650 – 700 K, oxygen resistant at 293 K and to react with water vapour at ~400K to yield CH4. The IR data obtained showed fast reversible transformation of MoCH2 to MoCD2 after C2D4 admission. In addition to MoCH2, the spectroscopic data indicate the formation of ethylene and propene π -complexes with Mo4+ ions and Mo cyclobutanes during CP chemisorption. Ethylene adsorbed on Mo4+ ions gave rise to π-complexes and possibly Mo-cyclopentane species. A general scheme for CP interaction with photoreduced Mo4+/SiO2 explaining all the spectroscopic data obtained, the composition of the thermally desorbed products and the promoting effect of CP chemisorption on metathesis is presented and discussed.",
