The effect of titanium on the structure of Ru/NaY and Ru/USY catalysts introduced by ion exchange or impregnation method was investigated. The crystallinity of USY zeolite decreased significantly after introduction of Ti by impregnation method and a separate phase of titania is formed. The specific activity related to CO formation in the reaction of CH4 reforming with CO2 is higher for Ti-containing catalysts due to the formation of new active sites at the metal-support interface that accelerate the decomposition of CH x O species, which is precursor for CO formation. Ru/NaY and Ru/USY catalysts were prepared by ion exchange from an aqueous solution of [Ru(NH3)6]Cl3. The effect of titanium on the structure of Ru/zeolite introduced by ion exchange or impregnation method from aqueous solution of (NH4)2TiO(C2O4)2·H2O was investigated. The samples were characterized by different techniques, using X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), temperature-programmed desorption of hydrogen (TPD-H2), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of CO adsorption and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Introduction of titanium into Ru/NaY zeolite by ion exchange caused a significant structural collapse of the zeolite framework. Contrary to that, TEM data showed that Ti incorporated into Ru/USY by ion exchange was well distributed within the zeolite cavities. The crystallinity of the USY zeolite decreased significantly after introduction of Ti by impregnation method and a separate phase of titania was formed. The effect of Ti content on the catalytic behavior of zeolite-supported Ru catalysts in the reaction of CO2 reforming of CH4 was elucidated. The higher specific activity of Ti-containing catalysts related to CO formation was caused by the both factors, the acceleration of CH x O decomposition (precursor for CO formation) on metal-support interface and participation of the reverse of water gas shift reaction. Keywords Zeolite-supported Ru catalysts USY NaY Titania CO2 reforming of CH4 1 Introduction During the last decade the catalytic reforming of methane with carbon dioxide has increasing interest as an alternative route for syngas production [1]. This process is attractive industrially due to low H2/CO product ratio, which is preferable for Fisher–Tropsch synthesis processes [2]. The high reaction enthalpies associated with methane reforming by carbon dioxide and its reverse reaction make this process one of the most suitable for application in the storage of renewable energy sources [3]. Natural gas reforming is questionable as to whether CH4/CO2 reforming can contribute to a solution of greenhouse problems. Reducing of sources of CH4 and non-CO2 greenhouse gases could lead to a decline in the rate of the global warming, reducing the danger of dramatic climate change [4]. However, transformation of CH4 and CO2 into synthesis gas followed by subsequent conversion via Fisher–Tropsh synthesis into fuels that would be sources for CO2 emissions. Considerable effort has been made towards the design and development of active, selective and stable catalyst for the reforming reaction of methane with carbon dioxide. The study of the catalysts for this reaction has been mainly focused on: (i) the dispersion and specific activity of metal phase; (ii) the stability towards carbon deposition; and (iii) the type of the support most suitable for improving the efficiency of the catalyst and the reaction mechanism. Industrially, the metal of choice for the catalyst is nickel supported on different carriers [5–7], due to its inherent availability and lower cost in comparison with noble metals. However, because the high endothermicity of the reaction, which requires high reaction temperature, supported nickel catalysts are more susceptible to coking than noble metals [8,9]. It has been shown, that specific noble metal may exibit different activity, depending on the nature of support. In several studies Ru and Rh supported on different oxides supports, like TiO2 [1–12], MgO [11], Al2O3 [9–16] or silica [16], have shown a superior activity in the reaction of CO2 reforming of methane. However the thermal stability of these catalysts has been very low. It is interesting to note that when the noble metals are supported on zeolite present extremely high thermal stability independently on the method of preparation [17,18]. These behaviors of the catalysts have been interpreted in terms of the structure sensitivity of the reaction and/or by participation of the support in the activation of methane and carbon dioxide molecules by introducing of an electron donation to the lowest unoccupied anti-bonding molecular orbital [9]. It is well known that TiO2 is one of the most widely used transition metal oxides in catalysis. On the other hand, a dispersion of titania in microporous zeolite of high surface area would be effective to increase the number of surface active sites of TiO2. In previously our work [10] we have observed that when Ru was supported on TiO2 exhibited very high activity in CO2 reforming of CH4 compared to that for Ru supported on NaY zeolite, followed by a rapid deactivation. Therefore, it would be very important to combine ruthenium with titania to obtain a catalyst with optimal catalytic properties, combining the unique stability of zeolite-supported Ru catalyst with the high activity of titania-supported Ru [10]. To our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to investigate the effect of titanium introduced by different methods on the structure and catalytic behavior of Ru-containing zeolite NaY and USY catalysts in the reaction of CH4 reforming with CO2. The work was concentrated on: (i) the effect of the type of zeolite support on the morphology of metal components; (ii) the method of introducing of Ti; and (iii) the influence of Ti content. Different techniques were applied for characterization of the samples: X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), temperature-programmed desorption of hydrogen (TPD-H2), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of samples NaY zeolite support was prepared from LZ Y-54 (Si/Al=2.6, Linde Molecular Sieves, Lot No. UOP-35-709). To remove the extra framework aluminium the HUSY zeolite from EZ-190P (Engelhard) was treated with an aqueous solution of H2SO4 at pH 4.5 and temperature of 343K, accompanied with a significant increasing of Si/Al ratio from 5.66 to 10.14 (Table 1 ). For obtaining of NH4USY zeolite the HUSY zeolite was treated by two successive exchanges with a solution of NH4NO3 (3moll−1) for 24h at room temperature. After that the sample was keep in desiccator with NH4Cl. Ruthenium was encapsulated into the NaY and NH4USY supports by ion exchange using aqueous solution of [Ru(NH3)6]Cl3 (Strem Chemicals, −99%). The ion-exchange procedure involved slowly adding of the dilute solution of [Ru(NH3)6]Cl3 (0.045gl−1) to a rapidly stirred zeolite slurry at room temperature over a period of 24h. The Ru-exchanged NaY and USY zeolite samples were washed with deionized water until Cl− detection with Ag+ was negative. The samples were dried under vacuum at room temperature. The Ru/zeolite catalysts were carried out in a helium flow (UHP-5.0, AGA-Brasil) of 100mlmin−1 at 2Kmin−1 from room temperature up to 773K, the held at the respective temperature for 30min. Heating in helium was necessary to avoid the formation of volatile RuO4. The theoretical amount of Ru was about 3wt.%. Titanium-exchanged Ru/zeolites were prepared via ion exchange with an aqueous solution of ammonium titanyl oxalate monohydrate, (NH4)2TiO(C2O4)2·H2O (Aldrich, 99.99% purity) (ATO), similar to the procedure reported by Liu et al. [19,20]. The ATO salt was chosen because the task was to find a titanium salt, which is soluble in water and toes not form colloidal suspensions. Ti-containing samples were filtered, washed with deionized water and dried under vacuum. The theoretical amount of ion exchanged Ti was 3wt.%. The samples were abbreviated as RuTi/NaY and RuTi/USY. Other samples were prepared by impregnation of Ru/USY zeolite with an aqueous solution of (NH4)2TiO(C2O4)2·H2O. In order to increase the amount of Ti the impregnation procedure was repeated. Ti-containing zeolites were dried and calcined by the same procedure cited above. The Ru content was 2wt.% in Ti-impregnated samples. The samples were abbreviated as Ru(x)Ti i /USY, where x is the theoretical amount of Ti (2 and 4wt.%). The Ti content of the samples determined by ICP is listed in Table 1. 2.2 Methods Chemical composition of the prepared samples (Si, Al, Ru, Ti) was determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP) for the samples dissolved in H2SO4:HF (1:1) solutions. The composition of the samples is listed in Table 1. XRD patterns were carried out by a Rigaku–Denki diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (50kV, 100mA) with a Ni filter. The step-scans taken over the range of 2θ from 3 to75 in step of 0.020°, the intensity data for each is being collected for 5s. Unit cell parameters (a 0), the number of Al per unit cell, N Al/cu, and Si/Al ratios were calculated accordingly [21]. The data are collected in Table 1. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded over the wavelength range λ=250–800nm using a Cary 5G UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer Varian. MgO was used as a reference for the samples. TPD patterns of chemisorbed H2 were recorded with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Dycor MA100M-Ametek) connected on-line with a micro reactor. The samples (0.50g) were placed in a glass reactor and heated from room temperature up to 773K at 2Kmin−1 in a He flow of 100ml/min and then reduced at 573K for 1h under H2 flow of 100mlmin−1. After reduction the samples were cooled to room temperature under atmosphere of H2. The TPR profile was recorded upon heating the sample from 298 to 1273K in the flow of He at 10Kmin−1. Infrared spectra measurements with CO adsorption were carried out with a Nicolet Magna 750 infrared Fourier transformed spectrometer with a deuterated triglycine sulphate pyroelectric detector (DTGS-KBr) at a spectral resolution of 4cm−1. The experiments ware performed in a system “Spectra Tech” with diffuse reflectance cell and DRIFT reactor cell with ZnSe windows. Following a thermal treatment in flow of N2 at 100mlmin−1, the samples were reduced from room temperature up to 773 in H2 (25%)/N2 flow at 10Kmin−1 and then maintained at 773K for 2h. After reduction the DRIFT cell was purged with a flow of N2 (100mlmin−1) for 20min and then the spectra were recorded. For experiments involving analysis of ruthenium carbonyl species, the catalysts were exposed to pulses of CO in flow of N2 for 5min at room temperature and pressure of 160Torr. The energy-filtered TEM was carried out on a Carl Zeiss CEM 902 TEM machine equipped with Cataing–Henry–Ottensmeyer filter spectrometer within the column was used. For individual zeolite particle examination, the images were obtained using zero loss energy, loss energies between 20 and 30eV and specific elemental energies. When monochromatic inelastically scattered electrons are selected, electron spectroscopic images are formed, in which the contrast is dependent on the local energy loss spectrum and thus on the concentration fluctuations of a particular chosen element. The electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) was obtained at the L2, 3 edge of Ti (455eV) and used as reference to acquire elemental maps distribution (ESI), using the three windows method [22]. Alternatively, EELS-image was obtained in the energy loss range from 390 to 476eV, with a 6eV slit. 2.3 Test reaction The CO2 reforming reaction of CH4 was carried out in a continuous flow tube reactor at 1atm pressure with a constant feed composition of CH4/CO2/N2 (20/20/60) at a total flow rate of 100, 200 and 300mlmin−1, with a 0.2g of catalyst. The Ru catalysts were tested in the temperature range of 723–873K. Some catalysts were tested at feed composition of CH4/CO2 of 66/33 to evaluate the thermal stability over period of 60h. The reaction data was monitored after 15min on stream. The rates for methane consumption, r CH4 , and for carbon oxide formation, r CO, for Ru supported catalysts were calculated per gram of Ru on catalyst surface under different CH4 conversions obtained by variation of the total flow rate. Reaction products were analyzed by on-line gas chromatography, employing a combination of two GCs (Varian-3400) having a TCD detector. One chromatograph employed He and the other N2 as carrier gas. For reaction product analysis, two columns of Porapak N and Molecular Sieve 13× were used in a series-bypass arrangement. 3 Results 3.1 XRD data XRD patterns of Ru(Ti)/NaY and Ru(Ti)USY catalysts are shown on Fig. 1A and B , respectively. A slight decrease in the intensities of the XRD patterns of Ru/NaY and Ru/USY zeolites after submission to ion exchange with Ru is observed (Fig. 1A(a) and (b)). This can be assigned to a structural modification that would be occurred after some dealumination of the zeolite framework (Table 1). The intensities of the XRD patterns characteristic of NaY zeolite decrease significantly when Ru/NaY is submitted to ion exchange with a solution of ATO (Fig. 1A(c)). The position of the peaks is slightly changed and the mean value of a 0 calculated from the strong diffraction peaks along 20.4, 23.7, 27.1 and 31.5° corresponding to (440), (533), (642) and (555) directions [23] decreased (from 24.65 to 24.36 for NaY and RuTiNaY, respectively) with a strong increasing of Si/Al ratio by proceeding titanium modification as seen in Table 1. Although the amount of introduced Ti in the zeolite is high, the Al content decreases, being supported by the higher values of Si/Al ratios of RuTi/NaY sample. A new diffuse reflectance band in the large 2θ region of 20–33° is observed, that can be connected with the presence of an amorphous material. It means a partial destruction of the zeolite structure, may be, due to a formation of larger pores caused by the strong dealumination of the zeolite framework during ion-exchange process with Ti. In addition, Ti species incorporated into zeolite does not form a separate phase from the zeolite, being seen from the XRD patterns (Fig. 1A(c)). There is a very slight change in the intensity of XRD patterns of Ru/USY sample after submission to ion exchange with titanium (Fig. 1B(c)). The Si/Al ratio retains practically constant after introduction of Ti into Ru/zeolite (Table 1). The Si/Al ratios for USY-supported zeolite catalysts determined by XRD and chemical analysis can vary little within experimental error and it is reasonable to conclude that there is no change in the ratios. A significant decrease of the intensity of the XRD patterns of the Ru/USY zeolite after impregnation with a solution of (NH4)2TiO(C2O4)2·H2O is observed (Fig. 1B(d) and (e)). RuTi i /USY zeolite with 4wt.% of Ti shows diffraction peaks at 25.28, 37.80 and 48.12° (Fig. 1B(e)), which can be related to the characteristic reflections from (101), (004) and (200) planes of anatase [24], respectively. These peaks are not observed in the diffraction patterns of RuTi i /USY sample with lower Ti loading (2wt.%). May be, the amount of Ti is not enough to give clear diffraction peaks of titania. However, a change of the background of this zeolite is observed, meaning a presence of structural collapse. It can be assumed, that a substantial crystal structure of USY zeolite is still retained, although the crystallinity of the USY zeolite decreases significantly with increasing of the amount of introduced titanium. 3.2 UV-Vis spectra Diffuse reflectance spectra of USY-supported samples and bulk TiO2 in the region of 275–800nm are shown in Fig. 2 . An UV absorption edge at about 420nm occurs for unsupported TiO2 caused by Ti4+←O2− charge transfer. Introduction of titanium into the zeolite leads to a blue shift of the absorption band from 420 (for bulk TiO2) to about 365 and 371nm for RuTi/USY and Ru(2)Ti i /NaY, respectively (Fig. 2(a) and (b)). The mechanism that causes the blue shift of the absorption of semiconductors was usually attributed to quantum size effect [25]. Shifting of the band to lower energies (eV) suggests a decreasing of the size of TiO2 particles [19]. A blue shift from 420 to 383nm is observed for Ti-impregnated Ru/USY sample with the highest Ti loading (Fig. 2(c)). It suggests that the size of impregnated Ti species is higher compared to that for Ti species obtained by ion exchange. It can be concluded that the UV absorption band position depends on the amount of titanium and on the method of its introduction into the zeolite. 3.3 TPD-H2 results The TPD-H2 profiles of Ru/USY and RuTi/USY samples present in Fig. 3A and B , respectively. A change in the temperature of the maximum of the main peaks is observed for the samples with and without of Ti. A strong peak at 1020K is occurred in the spectrum of Ru/USY sample (Fig. 3A). The spectrum of Ti-exchanged Ru/USY sample shows a strong TPD peak in the lower temperature region at 410K and small ones at about 665 and 1064K (Fig. 3B). The main peak at 410K can be related to desorption of H2 from Ru particles located in the zeolite super cages [10]. However, the high temperature peak at 1020K in the spectrum of Ru/USY zeolite (Fig. 3A) is not due to a desorption of H2 from Ru particles, because it is difficult to reconcile such a high temperature requirement with desorption of H2 from Ru. Similar to the observation of Lerner et al. [26] on the Pt/mordenite system, it can be supposed that the hydrogen released at the high temperature from Ru/USY after reduction at 500K is due to a re-oxidation of very small Ru particles, most likely, isolated Ru atoms, which are located in the cavities and/or hexagonal prisms. 3.4 FTIR of CO adsorption The infrared spectra of CO adsorbed on reduced USY-supported Ru and RuTi samples in the region 2200–1900cm−1 are shown in Fig. 4 . Two regions in the CO spectra are appeared: (i) high (2180–2126cm−1); and (ii) low energy region (2100–2000cm−1). Two high frequency CO bands at 2157 and 2134cm−1 are observed in the spectrum of Ru/USY sample (Fig. 4(a)). The observation of such species is reported in most of the works dealing with CO adsorption on supported and reduced ruthenium catalyst. The higher frequency bands may be assigned to adsorption of CO on charged Ru n+ species [27,28], connected with the presence of electron-deficient Ru or the presence of Ru with different electronic structure: Ru2+ and/or Ru3+ ions. In the lower energy region a band at 2086cm−1 appears as a shoulder on the strong band at 2099cm−1. A shoulder at about 2041cm−1 is also detected that can be attributed to linear metal Ru°–CO carbonyls [29,30]. The intensity of the 2099cm−1 band is changed after purged in He at 373K, while the shoulder at 2041cm−1 is preserved (Fig. 4(b)), meaning that the high frequency band belongs to a different species. The main feature in the spectra of Ti-containing Ru/USY zeolites is the broad low frequency band that is centered at 2036cm−1 for Ti ion-exchange sample and shifts to 2048cm−1 for Ti-impregnated sample (Fig. 4(c) and (d)). This frequency shift is typical for CO adsorption on transition metal surfaces and it has been interpreted in terms of surface heterogeneity or adsorbate interactions [31]. In addition, there is a change in the shape of this band; the FWHM of the band for Ti-impregnated sample is lower. The higher frequency bands did not appear in the spectrum of reduced Ti-impregnated Ru sample, whereas the intensity of these bands is very low for Ti exchange Ru/USY zeolite. Similar observations has been reported by Brown and Gonzalez [32] after CO adsorption on silica-supported Ru catalyst submitted to reduction at 598K for 6h; a strong band at 2030cm−1 and two weak bands at 2150 and 2080cm−1. Only one strong band at 2030cm−1 has been observed after CO adsorption on reduced Ru/alumina sample with particle size greater than 90Å [33]. 3.5 Electron microscopy Figs. 5 and 6 show TEM micrographs of Ru and RuTi/USY samples after auto-reduction in flow of He, respectively. It is clearly seen the presence of well-dispersed Ru particles of 1.5–2.5nm inside the USY zeolite (Fig. 5). Fig. 6A is an elemental energy loss map of Ti obtained by three window method; the clear areas correspond to titanium rich domains. At the same area 43 images were acquired around the edge of titanium, using EELS-image method; the presence of that element was verified at each point of image assembly, where the spectroscopic signal is a function of variation in the intensity of entire collection of analyzed pixels. It can be seen that titanium is distributed all within the sample, including the darker regions, where due plural scattering, which is function of thickness, caused a decrease in the signal. Positions 2 and 3 marked in Fig. 6A show the presence of titanium. Position 1, that is a control area without particles, does not show the presence of Ti (Fig. 6B). 3.6 Catalytic activity data Catalytic activity data for NaY- and USY-supported Ru and RuTi catalysts in the reaction of CO2 reforming of CH4 at 773 and 873K temperatures are listed in Table 2 . It is seen that the conversions of CH4 and CO2 are influenced by: (i) the type of zeolite; (ii) method of introduced Ti species; and (iii) concentration of the metals. Ru ion-exchanged NaY zeolite exhibits higher CH4 conversion as well as higher CO2 conversion compared to those of Ru ion-exchanged USY zeolite (Table 2). Ti-containing catalyst supported on NaY also shows higher conversions compared to those supported on USY. This must be connected with the higher Ru loading, as well as of Ti introduced in NaY zeolite (Table 1). For Ti-impregnated Ru/USY catalysts the conversions increase with increasing of Ti loading (Table 2). It has been shown [18] that the reaction equilibrium for the production of synthesis gas from CH4 reforming with CO2 (Eq. (1)) is strongly influenced by the simultaneous occurrence of the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction (Eq. (2)), in which H2 produced via reforming reacts with CO2 to yield H2O and CO: (1) CH 4+CO 2⇔2H 2+2CO (2) CO 2+H 2⇔CO+H 2 O According the kinetic investigations of CH4 reforming with CO2 some authors have shown that RWGS reaction operates very close to thermodynamic equilibrium [34,35], others have assumed [36] that the WGS reaction to be at thermodynamic equilibrium to facilitate analysis. Bradford and Vannice [18] have reported that RWGS reaction is near thermodynamic equilibrium over a wide range of temperatures. From Table 2 it is seen that the values of CO2 conversions for the catalysts are higher compared to those of CH4 conversions as a consequence of the RWGS equilibrium [18]. The conversions increase with increasing of the reaction temperature. It should be expected that the H2/CO ratios be also increased. All catalysts at 773 and 873K show H2/CO ratio lower than 1 (Table 1). The measured H2/CO ratios from Table 2 showed good agreement with those calculated by Eq. (3), presented by Bradford and Vannice [9] when the reaction equilibrium is influenced by the RWGS reaction: (3) H 2 CO = 3−r CO 2 /r CH 4 1+r CO 2 /r CH 4 where r CH4 and r CO2 are the experimental rates of CH4 and CO2 conversions, respectively (Table 2). There is a strong relation between carbon dioxide conversions and the H2/CO ratios; the H2/CO decreases with increasing of CO2 conversion (Table 2), confirming the strong influence of the water gas shift equilibrium. The dependence of the rate of CO formation on the partial pressures of CO and H2 for different catalysts, plotted in Fig. 7 , is approximately linear. It appears that the observed variation of catalyst activity with partial pressures for CO2 reforming of CH4 is due to the reverse reaction, i.e. CO hydrogenation, as was shown previously using a similar analysis [10,11]. The observed trend in r CO with partial pressures of H2 and CO shows a strong influence of the pressures over Ti-containing catalysts. However, the influence of reverse reaction is higher over Ru supported catalysts under these reaction conditions. The results indicate that significantly high space velocity must used to maintain lower conversions that decrease effluent partial pressures of H2 and CO. This minimizes the influence of the reverse reaction during kinetic studies of CO2 reforming of CH4 as was shown in our previously published works [10,11]. The H2/CO ratio is nearly unity for Ru ion-exchanged catalysts with different weight loadings of Ru. This ratio is lowered for Ti-containing catalysts, due to a strong influence of the RWGS reaction. Considering the preparation method the impregnated catalysts show lowest H2/CO ratio and higher specific activities that increase with Ti loading. 4 Discussion 4.1 Structural properties of zeolite-supported Ru and RuTi catalysts Change in the zeolite structure after replacement of the ions in NaY and NH4USY by Ru and Ti is evident by comparison of the XRD patterns of the zeolites before and after ion exchange and/or impregnation process. For zeolites submitted to ion exchange with Ru less structural changes are observed compared to those submitted to Ti deposition. The changes in the structural properties of the both zeolite-supported metal catalysts account to the different pore size of these materials. The slight change in the Si/Al ratio and N Al/cu (Table 1), as well as the increase of pore volume (from 0.13 to 0.24cm3 g−1 for NaY and Ru/NaY, respectively) would be result of some diffusion of Ru to the external surface of zeolite during heating in He up to 773K, although most of the metal was inside of the zeolite framework being seen by TEM [10]. The higher Si/Al ratio determined by ICP analysis for Ti-modified Ru/NaY sample (Table 1), probably is caused by the net acidity of (NH4)2TiO(C2O4)2·H2O solution (pH≅3), which provokes a strong dealumination of the zeolite framework. On the other hand, a negative effect of the protons within the zeolite on the size of metal particles is revealed similar for rhodium in HY and NaY zeolites during hydrothermal treatment [17,37,38]. The protons formed after auto-reduction of [Ru(NH3)6]3+ complex in Ru/NaY zeolite and then connected with H2O from aqueous solution of ATO can provoke a hydrolysis of Al–O bonds. This involves a localized destruction of the lattice and a secondary pore system is generated. The pore volume of Ru/NaY zeolite increases significantly after introduction of Ti (up to 0.63cm3 g−1), corresponding to formation of mesopores (Table 1). Filling of these pores by titanium metal species will result in easily particle agglomeration that leads to a structural collapse. The latter is supported by the significant change in the background of the XRD patterns for RuTi/NaY sample (Fig. 1). It is surprising the increased amount of Ti for Ti-exchanged NaY sample compared to that for RuTi/USY, independently on the higher Si/Al ratio for the first one (Table 1). It should be suggest that the amount of incorporated titanium would be affected by the ion-exchange capacity of the corresponding zeolite. One of the reasons why Ti is incorporated in excess as compared with the number of Al content of RuTi/NaY zeolite is the formation of Ti–O–Si bonds during preparation procedure according the proposed mechanism by Chen et al. [24]. The authors supposed that during calcination titanyl ions (TiO2+) reacted with the lattice oxygen to give TiO2 or TiO+, a rehydroxylation brings about acidic hydroxyls and the Al–O–Si and Ti–O–Si bonds are formed. The formation of these bonds leads to a strong structural deformation of the framework of NaY zeolite, since the amount of Ti–O–Si bonds increases with the amount of incorporated Ti. The above-mentioned authors suggested also that Ti species formed in NaY zeolite not only originated from the titanyl ion introduced by ion-exchange process, but also can be formed from the decomposition of titanyl oxalate salt which remained on the zeolite by the impregnation process, followed by calcination [24]. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that the ion-exchange capacity of NaY zeolite is higher compared to that of USY. The higher amount of introduced Ti species into Ru/NaY zeolite is due to both: (i) Ti ion exchanged; and (ii) filling of the larger pores formed after structural collapse of the zeolite with titanium species. Contrary to that, the low Ti and Ru content for Ti-exchanged Ru/USY zeolite is due to the higher Si/Al ratio, obtained after acidic Al leaching of initial USY zeolite. TEM data for Ru/USY and RuTi/USY zeolites show that all the species present in the samples are ion exchanged and located inside the zeolite cavities. No observable TiO2 crystalline patterns in the XRD spectra and the significant blue shift in the UV-Vis spectrum for Ti species suggest that the particle size of these species in the exchanged samples is very small. In addition, TEM data support that Ti ions, anchored within the zeolite cavities by ion-exchange method, are well-dispersed titanium oxide species. However, titanium oxide species forms a separate phase from the zeolite after impregnation of Ru/USY zeolite with solution of ATO at higher Ti content, being seen from the XRD patterns (Fig. 1B(e)). This can be connected with the pore plugging with aggregated TiO2 crystallites, originated from the decomposition of titanyl oxalate salt during heating in flow of He up to 773K. The average pore volume was changed from 0.27 to 0.11cm3 g−1 for Ru/USY and Ru(4)Ti i /USY, respectively. In addition, a big fraction of large TiO2 crystallites is accumulating on the external surface of the USY zeolite. IR data of CO adsorption show that the local environments of ruthenium particles on each sample are quite different. The appearance of high frequency bands in reduced Ru/USY catalyst is connected with the presence of isolated, electro-deficient Ru atoms. It is well known [39] that the extent of the electron deficiency depends on the proton concentration and the size of the metal clusters in agreement with the model of metal-proton adducts [Me n –H x ] x+, in which the positive charge is distributed between metal and hydrogen atoms. Consequently, the electron-deficient Ru can be ascribed to electron sharing with zeolite protons from USY zeolite, which can be formed after thermal decomposition of NH4 + ions and/or as a co-product of reduction of ruthenium cations with H2. Once the metal-proton adducts were formed in Ru/USY zeolite, the reduction of Ru particles would be difficult and more electron-deficient ions will present in the framework of reduced Ru/USY zeolite. McCarthy et al. [40] have been attributed the CO FTIR band at about 2099cm−1 (Fig. 4(a)) to the presence of very small metal particles and a high proton concentration in zeolite framework of Ru-exchanged NaY zeolite. From Fig. 4 it is seen that the position of the high frequency bands is sensitive to the method of preparation of zeolite-supported catalyst. The main band at 2099cm−1, as well as, another high frequency bands are not present in the IR spectra of Ti-containing samples upon reduction as a consequence of the absence of the interaction between protons and Ru metal particles. It means that auto-reduction in He up to 773K followed by reduction at 773K produces fully reduced ruthenium particles in RuTi samples, as well as agglomeration of the particles, being seen by the IR band at 2030–2050cm−1 (Fig. 4). It is clear that the agglomeration of Ru particles in USY zeolite is reduced when the aluminium extra framework is eliminated and the metal dispersion of the catalyst increases with increasing of Si/Al ratio (TEM, Table 1). As the zeolite is dealuminated to a greater extent, the intensity of exchangeable sites (tetrahedral Al) become lower, thus making these sites more separated within the zeolite crystallites. After ion exchange the Ru ions will be more isolated from each other and less metal sintering would be occurred. On the other hand, Ru atoms can be anchored with protons from the zeolite and/or with protons formed after auto-reduction in He in metal-proton adducts. It is known [41] that two main reasons has been considered for the suppression of hydrogen chemisorption: (i) the small size of the formed metal clusters; and (ii) the interaction of the clusters with protons of the zeolite and formation of metal-proton adducts, that leads to a change in the electronic structure (Fig. 4) of Ru clusters. This induces a lowering of the propensity of Ru particles in Ru/USY zeolite to chemisorb hydrogen during reduction in flow of H2. The presence of mono-atomic Ru in [Ru n –H x ] x+ adducts could be easily re-oxidized by protons to Ru n+, similar to Pt in HY and NaY zeolites [41], and the H2 evolution will be registered at higher temperature of 1020K. Contrary to that, Ru atoms, which are preliminary formed in sodalite cages and/or hexagonal prisms of USY, migrate to the supercages after both, the incorporation of Ti and reduction treatment, where they agglomerated (TEM). The protons will be left behind in the small cages. Therefore the formation of [Ru n H]+ adducts will be limited in the supercages; the majority of Ru will exist as neutral Ru clusters, which have a higher propensity to chemisorb a hydrogen [17]. In is interesting to note, that the intensity of the peaks due to bridged hydroxyl groups at ca. 3740cm−1 in the OH region of the IR spectra of Ru/USY samples after CO adsorption (the spectra are not shown) decreases as result of CO chemisorption on Ru. This suggests that protons in [Ru n °–H x ] x+ adducts are partially displaced by CO. 4.2 Catalytic activity The difference in the activity of zeolite-supported Ru only catalysts can be related to the accessible metal surface area of ruthenium particles. It has been shown [10,11] that the influence of zeolite as support was limited to affect the metal dispersion during the course of the catalyst preparation and stabilization of the metal surface area under reaction conditions, which is responsible for catalyst activity, similar to the inert SiO2 support [16]. The more active Ru/NaY catalyst compared to Ru/USY can be related to the higher Ru loading, as well as to the difference in the dispersion of Ru species. As was supposed above the Ru species located in supper cages of NaY would be easily reduced during preliminary reduction and under reaction conditions. TEM micrographs show the presence of small Ru particles of 1–2nm, consequently well-dispersed metal in USY. This causes a easily formation of metal-proton adducts in the cavities of Ru/USY zeolite (TPD, FTIR), which inhibits the dissociative adsorption of methane on Ru particles, like to the inhibition of dissociative chemisorption of H2 [42] causing the decrease in CH4 and CO2 conversions. Considering the presence of Ti the order of activity compared by specific activities (r CH4 or r CO) for zeolite-supported catalysts decreases in the following order: Ru(4)Ti i /USY>RuTi/USY>Ru(2)Ti i /USY>RuTi/NaY>Ru/NaY>Ru/USY (Table 2). It can be concluded that all Ti-containing samples show higher catalytic activity compared to those without Ti as it is more evident for catalysts supported on USY zeoilite. The catalytic activity increases with increasing of Ti content. The influence of RWGS reaction is greater for catalysts containing Ti. It is evident that the rate data (Table 2) reflect the participation of titania in the catalytic cycle, although the reforming of CH4 with CO2 has been reported to be structure sensitive over titania-supported noble metals for dispersion above 25% [8,13]. The difference in the activity may be related to the activation of the CH4 and CO2 dissociation, which requires electron donation from the surface. The activation of CH4 on the metal surface is the rate-limiting during CO2 reforming of CH4, as reported previously, which involves the dependence of catalytic activity on %d-character of metal [7]. It has been reported that the introduction of a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect into TiO2-supported metal catalysts correlated with the increasing of electron density in the metal crystallites [8,13] and formation of active interfacial Ru–Ti n+O x species. DRIFTS results [9,43] have considered that CH4 dissociation to CH x and CH x O species, as well as CO2 dissociation to anionic CO2-precursor [44] can be accelerated on metal-support interfacial region because of creation of new active sites, like metal−Ti n+ or metal–Ti n+−O m− sites. The electron effects may become significant when the supported metal Ru particles are well dispersed on the zeolite support as in the case of Ni/TiO2 [7], where Ni was speared in thin rafts on the support surface. Therefore, the specific activity of Ti-containing Ru/zeolite catalysts are higher than for supported Ru catalysts (Table 2) because of the creation of new active sites in metal-support interfacial region, which can accelerate the formation of CH x O decomposition, precursor for CO formation. It cannot be excluded the acidic nature of these catalysts. According the literature [45] the higher value of Si/Al ratio for NaY-supported RuTi catalyst compared to those for dealuminated USY catalysts means that a significant number of acidic aluminium is retained in the zeolite after dealumination. This leads to a generation of acid sites that could promote the hydrogenation of carbon oxide [46]. However, the higher rate for CO formation for RuTi/NaY catalyst (Table 2) suggests that the influence of the acidity is minimized in the reaction of CO2 reforming of CH4. In the same time, the reaction on zeolite-supported Ru catalysts would be catalyzed by “the electron deficient” of [Ru n H] n+ adducts. Therefore, the decrease of CO formation can be related to a hydrogenation of CO similar to our previous observations [10]. The Ru and TiRu supported catalysts showed high stability in the activity under reaction conditions during 60h. Different opinions have been proposed about the high stability of zeolite-supported noble metals [16,47]. Ones authors connect the high thermal stability with the high dispersion of metal particles. However, Bhat and Sachtler [17] have shown that the high thermal stability of Rh/NaY zeolite in CO2 reforming of CH4 was related to large Rh particles of 40Å, which are formed in the initial stage of the catalytic operation: ones they are formed no further agglomeration take place. On the other hand, it has been shown [7,8] that TiO2-supported group VIII metals exhibit suppressed carbon formation during CO2 reforming of CH4 due the decoration of metal particle surfaces by TiO x species which destroy large ensembles of metal atoms that serve as active sites for carbon formation. 5 Conclusions The relative amount of electron-deficient Ru atoms in Ru exchanged USY zeolite is higher compared to that of Ti-containing Ru/USY zeolite, due to the presence of metal-proton adducts. Introduction of titanium into Ru/NaY zeolite by ion exchange leads to a significant structural collapse of the zeolite framework. Contrary to that, TEM data showed that Ti incorporated into Ru/USY by ion exchange is well distributed within the zeolite cavities. The specific activity related to formation of CO increases with increasing of Ti content caused by the creation of new active sites at metal-support interfacial region, which can accelerate the formation of CH x O decomposition, precursor for CO formation. On the other hand, the influence of reverse of water gas shift reaction on the activity is higher for Ti-containing catalysts. The reforming reaction on zeolite-supported Ru catalysts is mainly catalyzed by the presence of metal-proton adducts clusters, that causes the hydrogenation of CO.

The effect of titanium on the structure of Ru/zeolite introduced by ion exchange or impregnation method from aqueous solution of (NH4)2TiO(C2O4)2·H2O was investigated. The samples were characterized by different techniques, using X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), temperature-programmed desorption of hydrogen (TPD-H2), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of CO adsorption and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Introduction of titanium into Ru/NaY zeolite by ion exchange caused a significant structural collapse of the zeolite framework. Contrary to that, TEM data showed that Ti incorporated into Ru/USY by ion exchange was well distributed within the zeolite cavities. The crystallinity of the USY zeolite decreased significantly after introduction of Ti by impregnation method and a separate phase of titania was formed. The effect of Ti content on the catalytic behavior of zeolite-supported Ru catalysts in the reaction of CO2 reforming of CH4 was elucidated. The higher specific activity of Ti-containing catalysts related to CO formation was caused by the both factors, the acceleration of CH x O decomposition (precursor for CO formation) on metal-support interface and participation of the reverse of water gas shift reaction.",
