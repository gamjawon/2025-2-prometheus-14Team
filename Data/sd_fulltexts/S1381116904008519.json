The use of acetic anhydride is completely eliminated with almost zero emission of effluents. There is no formation of oxygenates or side chain nitration. The influence of experimental conditions like effect of solvent, rate of addition of nitric acid, effect of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, are also investigated. The process is eco-friendly and less expensive and represents a clean synthesis of nitro aromatic compounds with higher regio-selectivity. Graphical abstract o-Xylene was nitrated with high regio-selectivity by using beta zeolite as a catalyst and with a stoichiometric amount of nitric acid. Keywords Nitration Beta zeolite o-Xylene Regio-selectivity 1,2-Dichloroethane 1 Introduction Nitration of aromatic compounds is a widely used reaction to realise organic intermediates required in large tonnages for the fine chemical industry. The conventional eco-unfriendly nitration process, employing a nitrating mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid, for the last two centuries has remained unchallenged in the commercial arena owing to the uneconomical alternative options [1–2]. Research in dispensing the use of sulfuric acid in general in the nitration of aromatic compounds and selective synthesis of the desired isomer in the nitration of substituted benzenes in particular is of topical interest, since it reduces pollution caused by spent acid and unwanted isomers and more specifically to respond to market demand. Various novel options, meeting international environmental laws, and also avoiding the recovery of the spent acid in the conventional mixed acid process have been explored in the nitration of benzene and toluene [3–13]. However, these options fall short of expectations to commercial realisation in view of low space-time yields, high dilution, and/or use of explosive and relatively expensive mixtures in the form of acetic anhydride-nitric acid or expensive acyl or alkyl nitrate. Nitration reactions performed with ionic liquids [14], albeit, at very low temperatures offers no isomeric selectivity. We recently reported an efficient methodology with high p-selectivity for the nitration of mono substituted aromatic compounds employing beta zeolite as catalyst with nitric acid as nitrating agent [15]. The mononitro derivatives of o-, m-and p-xylenes isomers are used as intermediates for the production of vitamins, agrochemicals, fragrances and dyes. Although 4- and 3-nitro-o-xylenes are useful starting materials for the production of riboflavin (Vitamin B2) and mefenamic acid, an agrochemical, respectively, the former is required in large tonnage. Selective nitration of o-xylene, thus, assumes higher importance. Nitration of o-xylene in the conventional method, using a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid as the nitrating mixture gives a mixture of 4-nitro-o-xylene 31–55% and 3-nitro-o-xylene 45–69%. The earlier attempts [16–21] of nitration of xylene isomers have been made with either expensive or hazardous starting materials with lower selectivity. Nitration of o-xylene catalyzed by beta zeolite in vapour phase using the N2O4 as a nitrating agent [22] and in liquid phase using acetic anhydride, nitric acid mixture [11] and by silica supported solid catalysts with 100% nitric acid [23] offers lower selectivity towards 4-nitro-o-xylene with simultaneous production of large amounts of oxygenates, like tolualdehyde, toluic acid or side products, such as o-nitrotoluene, etc. We have a European patent granted in 2003 [24] for the nitration of o-xylene using beta zeolite with 40% conversion and 68% of 4-nitro-o-xylene and 30% of 3-nitro-o-xylene with a small amount of dinitro derivative in liquid phase. Very recently, Dongare and co-worker [25] reported the nitration of o-xylene using beta zeolite in liquid phase exhibits a conversion of 28% and selectivity of 63% of 4-nitro-o-xylene initially, which is fast decreasing, in vapour phase with a conversion of 65% and 60% of 4-nitro-o-xylene, 19% of 3-nitro, o-xylene and 21% of oxygenates and α–MPNM. The excellent applications of nitroxylene isomers in general and the poor isomeric selectivity towards 4-nitro-o-xylene or large amounts of oxygenates expressed in the nitration of o-xylene in particular prompted us to undertake the present the nitration of xylenes using beta zeolite in an effort to evolve eco-friendly and high atom utilization process. We report in this paper the nitration of o-xylene with highest isomeric selectivity for 4-nitro-o-xylene using beta zeolite catalyst (Scheme 1 ) in liquid phase with reuse of the solid acid catalyst being possible by azeotropic removal of water formed in the reaction and present in nitric acid. 2 Experimental 2.1 General Beta zeolite catalyst was procured from Zeolyst International. Dichloroethane, o-xylene and nitric acid were obtained from commercial sources and used as such without further purification. All the results are based on GC analysis. The products formed were confirmed by GC–MS. BET analysis was done on Quantachrome Autosorb Automated Gas Sorption System. 2.2 General procedure for nitration of o-xylene In a typical experimental run, 10mmol of o-xylene (1.06g) and 0.1g (10.0% by weight, based on xylene) of the catalyst were taken in a 50ml two-necked round-bottomed flask along with 6ml of dichloroethane as the solvent. The resulting mixture was heated to reflux temperature and when the steady state is acquired, 12mmol of nitric acid (70%) was slowly added for 1h. After addition of nitric acid, the temperature was maintained for 3h. Water formed during the reaction was separated by a reverse Dean–Stark apparatus. On completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was filtered and the filtrate was subjected to base wash to remove the excess acid. Under similar conditions the nitration of m- and p-xylenes were also performed. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Influence of various catalysts In an effort to evolve the best catalyst, different solid acid catalysts were screened under identical reaction conditions in the nitration of o-xylene (Table 1 ). ZSM-5 zeolite (entry-1) afforded a poor isomeric ratio of 4-nitro/3-nitro-o-xylenes, 0.62. This is because of the low diffusion of aqueous HNO3 in the hydrophobic pores of ZSM-5 and the resulting density of acidic sites is too low to promote the generation of nitronium ions from nitric acid and hence the reaction takes place only on the surface of the zeolite. The use of Fe3+ and H+-montmorillonites (entries 2 and 3) catalysts increased the isomeric ratio to 0.92. Among all the solid acid catalysts, beta zeolite-II displayed the best isomeric ratio 2.26 (entry 6). 3.2 Influence of Si/Al ratio Among all the solid acid catalysts, beta zeolite-II displays the best isomeric ratio 2.26 as well as conversion (entry-6). There is no formation of oxygenates and side chain nitration products. In the experiments with beta zeolites of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios 22 and 27 (Table 1, entries 5 and 6), high SiO2/Al2O3 provides a low selectivity towards 4-nitro-o-xylene. The particle size of the beta zeolite catalysts is determined by TEM photographs. More agglomeration was observed in the catalyst with low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio. Despite of the agglomeration of the particles, the acidity increases as the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio decreases, which in turn yields higher activity. Thus, effect of particle size is masked and allows higher activity due to increased acidic sites. On the other hand, the higher selectivity obtained with the low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio may be due to the agglomeration of particles. 3.3 Influence of rate of addition of nitric acid The influence of rate of addition of nitric acid, nature of solvent used and reaction time on the conversion and regio-selectivities of the reaction in the nitration of o-xylene was studied. We performed the nitration by different rates of addition of the nitric acid (Fig. 1 ). It reveals that the decrease in the rate of addition of nitric acid increases the selectivity towards 4-nitro isomer. A maximum selectivity of 4-nitro isomer was achieved when the rate of addition of nitric acid was 1.0ml/h. One possible reason for the better selectivity at slow addition of nitric acid is the immediate azeotropic removal of water formed during the reaction, which otherwise causes the deactivation of the catalyst. 3.4 Influence of solvent In order to determine the best reaction medium, we tested different solvents on the conversion and 4-nitro selectivity of the reaction (Table 2 ). Among the solvents used, hydrocarbons provided lower yields. On the other hand, the chlorinated solvents, CCl4 and dichloroethane (DCE) are proved to be the best entrainers for the effective removal of water azeotropically to provide higher conversions. Dichlormethane is not an effective entrainer, as it gives side products in large amounts. Dichloroethane was found to be the effective solvent providing high selectivity and conversions. This was also observed in the selective chlorination by Kale [26]. To observe the rate of change of conversion and selectivity with time, we followed the nitration reaction by GC at regular intervals of time during the reaction and the results were as shown in Fig. 2 . The conversion gradually increases with increase of time, with consistent selectivity towards 4-nitro-o-xylene. Finally, m- and p-xylenes were also nitrated under similar conditions and the results were as shown in Table 3 . 3.5 Consistent activity of the catalyst In order to test the activity of the catalyst, after the completion of the 4h of the reaction, again 10mmol of o-xylene and 12mmol of 70% HNO3 were added in the same manner as stated above and continued further for 4h. Similarly, two more cycles were done and found that the activity and selectivity were retained (Fig. 3 ) for total four cycles. The XRD analysis of the used catalyst did not show any degradation in the framework of the zeolite. However, there is a considerable increase in the surface area and mesopore volume of the used catalyst as indicated by BET analysis. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, a process for the nitration of o-xylene with enhanced regio-selectivity and activity was achieved by using beta zeolite catalyst having low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio using nitric acid as nitrating agent and dichloroethane as the best entrainer. The higher regio-selectivity is attributed to the agglomeration of particles, while the higher activity is due to increased acidic sites prompted by high Al concentration. This catalyst has the several advantages over conventional approach, viz., easy separation of catalyst by simple filtration, zero emission of effluents, higher regio-selectivities and more over its non-corrosive nature.

The use of acetic anhydride is completely eliminated with almost zero emission of effluents. There is no formation of oxygenates or side chain nitration. The influence of experimental conditions like effect of solvent, rate of addition of nitric acid, effect of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, are also investigated. The process is eco-friendly and less expensive and represents a clean synthesis of nitro aromatic compounds with higher regio-selectivity.",
