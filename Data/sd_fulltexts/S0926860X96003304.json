The oxidation of butane and the intermediates butadiene and furan using 1802 as oxygen source showed that a redox mechanism operates in all reaction steps including the conversion of furan to maleic anhydride. The formation of CO2, however, is explained by both a redox mechanism and a mechanism in which adsorbed oxygen species are involved. Keywords: n-Butane oxidation; Maleic anhydride; VPO catalyst; Oxygen exchange 1. Introduction The catalytic oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride (MA) is well known to occur selectively on (VO)2P207 based catalysts and is commercially applied since the 70's. A MA yield of up to 56% at a butane conversion degree of 80% is obtained in multi tubular fixed bed reactors [1]. To further increase MA selectivity by appropriate composition and operation of the catalyst more information is necessary about the reaction mechanism which is not yet well understood in detail and about the properties of (VO)2P207, the * Corresponding author, tel.: +49-30-63924310; fax: +49-30-63924350; e-mail: b.kubias@aca.fta-berlin.de 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Rodemerck et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 203-216 unique catalyst for this reaction which shows commercially sufficient high performance. According to the fact that MA formation requires the abstraction of 8 hydrogen atoms and the insertion of 3 oxygen atoms into the butane molecule the reaction proceeds via a complex multistage mechanism which is affected by the structural, redox and topological properties of the catalyst [ 1-3]. It is generally accepted that the reaction occurs entirely on the catalyst surface. On active and selective catalysts being in an equilibrated state, i.e., having been some 100 h time-on- stream [1] under oxygen excess and at atmospheric pressure, no reaction inter- mediates could be detected up to now. Using oxygen deficient [4] or vacuum conditions [5], however, partial oxidation products, the n-butenes, butadiene and furan were observed. Therefore, a reaction chain from butane to MA via these intermediates was derived [4,5]. Different mechanisms of the intermediate reaction steps and different kinds of active sites for each step have been proposed [1-3]. This concems the question if the conversion of butane to MA proceeds only via redox steps or if adsorbed oxygen species are involved in some steps. If redox steps are assumed to take part in the reaction, the role of the different valence states of vanadium is still under discussion [1]. From transient experiments applying the TAP reactor Ebner and Gleaves concluded that activated, long living adsorbed oxygen species O* are necessary for the activation of butane and the oxidation of furan to MA whereas lattice oxygen should take part in the reaction steps from the butenes to furan [5-7]. In a paper published later [8] Ebner et al. have given up their assumption that adsorbed oxygen species participate in the butane activation step and have favoured a redox step. Despite this, it was claimed that such an adsorbed oxygen species should be involved in the step from furan to MA under steady-state conditions at ambient pressure [8]. The latter assumption was recently supported by results of Agaskar et al. [9] who found that selective butane oxidation proceeds when molecular oxygen was fed over a (VO)2P207 catalyst whereas monoatomic oxygen species produced by decomposition of N20 were not able to form MA under comparable reaction conditions. Other authors also assumed that adsorbed oxygen species are involved in steps of the reaction chain from butane to MA [10,11]. Other observations make the participation of adsorbed oxygen less probable: Butane oxidation occurs on (VO)2P207 catalysts in the absence of oxygen for some time (anaerobic conditions), too [12,13]. In fact, it is possible to separate the oxidation of butane by an oxidized catalyst and the re-oxidation of the reduced catalyst by gas phase oxygen in a riser reactor and to obtain MA selectivities of up to 80% by using such a process [14]. Furthermore, Emig et al. [15] have shown that the presence of gas phase oxygen in the anaerobic zone of such a reactor decreases MA selectivity. These findings support the assumption that a redox mechanism operates in the conversion of butane to MA. However, under steady state conditions U. Rodemerck et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 203-216 205 in the presence of air (aerobic conditions) the participation of adsorbed oxygen species cannot be excluded. Against this background it was the aim of the present study to elucidate the role of oxygen in the selective and non-selective reaction pathways, i.e., the type of mechanism with respect to the nature of oxygen species involved in the different intermediate reaction steps. Transient as well as steady-state flow experiments in vacuo were carried out applying butane, the intermediates butadiene and furan and mixtures thereof with oxygen 1602 or lso2 as feed gas. Further studies aiming at the nature of the active sites with respect to the vanadium valence state and at the identification of other intermediate reaction products are published elsewhere [16,17]. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst and reaction feeds The (VO)2P207 catalyst applied in this work was prepared in aqueous solution: The alcohol-free, sulfate-containing catalyst precursor VOHPO4.0.5H20 was obtained by evaporating a solution of V205 and oxalic acid in diluted H3PO4 at 150 using H2SO4 as structure directing agent as described in [18]. This precursor was pressed into tablets which were crushed and then sieved. The grain fraction from 0.3--0.5 mm was calcined for 4 h at 480 in a stream of pure nitrogen. Treating (VO)2P207 in a flow of an 1.5% butane-in-air mixture (2 h at _>480) and adjusting butane conversion to above 99% resulted in a quasi- equilibrated catalyst [18]. This catalyst showed an activity and selectivity very similar to that of a catalyst after several hundred hours on stream (so-called equilibrated catalyst [1]). The quasi-equilibrated catalyst exhibited a BET surface of 14.2 m2 g-t (one-point BET method), a V: S : P ratio of 1 : 0.006 : 0.977 and an average vanadium valence state of +4.022 determined by potentiometric titration (see [16]). On its surface carbon containing residues are present as a consequence of its exposition to butane/air mixtures as was shown by pulsing oxygen over the catalyst under TAP conditions resulting in the formation of CO2. The only crystalline phase detected by XRD was (VQ)2P207. The purity of n-butane, 1,3-butadiene, furan and 1802 used for TAP experiments was more than 99.5%. 1602 and neon contained less than 0.01% impurities. The following feeds were used in aerobic experiments: 1602 : CaHIo =8 : 1, 4 : 1, 1 : 1 1802 : C4H10 ----4: 1, 1.1 : 1 1802 : C4H6 =3.3 : 1 1802 : C4H40 =5.9 : 1 Usually 10% neon were added as an internal standard. 206 U. Rodemerck et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 203-216 2.2. Vacuum transient experiments in the TAP reactor The TAP reactor system has been described in detail by Gleaves et al. [7]. Therefore, only the typical experimental modes used in this work are presented here. 0.2 g of catalyst were used in each experiment. The catalyst was placed between two layers of inert corundum (c~-A1203) to fix it in the isothermal zone of the micro-reactor. To measure the reaction temperature a thermocouple was placed in the centre of the catalyst bed. The reactor was heated in vacuum (approximately 10-4 mbar) before the experiments to remove all loosely bonded species from the catalyst surface. The undiluted gas feed is passed through the reactor by diffusion. Two experimental modes [7] of the TAP reactor system were used: In the scan mode a continuous stream of reactants was fed by a flow valve. The reaction products were analysed at the reactor outlet by a quadrupole mass spectrometer (UTI 100 C). Using this mode, reaction products and intermediates can be detected by their characteristic molecular ions or fragments in the scan mass spectrum. The peak intensity of an ion in the spectrum is proportional to the concentration of the product. In the pulse mode a small gas pulse (approximately 1016 molecules, half width less than 500~ts) produced by a high speed beam valve was introduced into the bed of catalyst. Each reaction product was analysed at the reactor outlet separately by its characteristic molecular ion with a high time resolution below 10~ts. 20-40 pulses were averaged to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Since only one ion can be detected simultaneously different molecular ions can only be measured one after the other. In this mode the peak shape provides information about the residence time of the product in the reactor system. The peak area is proportional to the product concentration. Butane, butene, butadiene, dihydrofuran, crotonaldehyde and furan were fed to the empty reactor and their mass spectra were recorded with the QMS. The solid substance MA was put into the empty reactor which was then heated to obtain a sufficiently high vapour pressure to record a mass spectrum. The reaction products were identified and their concentrations were measured by the following molecular ions: Ne (m/e=28) as internal standard, CO2 (rrde=44), butane (m/e=58), butenes (m/e=56), butadiene (m/e=54), furan (m/e=68), and MA (m/e=98). Some of these masses are also fragments of other reaction compounds. Therefore, the parts of peak areas deriving from other reaction products had to be subtracted. E.g., the peak area (A) of the product butene is equal to the peak area of its molecular ion Am/e=56 minus the peak area caused by the fragment ride=56 in the mass spectrum of n-butane which is calculated from the ratio of m/e=56 to m/e=58 (0.106) in the butane spectrum and the peak area of Am/e=58 measured in the reaction gas (the small differences in the mass spectra of the different n-butenes U. Rodemerck et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 203-216 207 were neglected): Ab,,e,,e = An,/e_56 - O. 106 Am/e-58. Abutadiene : Am/e-54 -- 0.0794 Abutene -- 0.0325 \" Am/e=5S - 12.3 \"Am/e 98\" Aco2 = Am~e_44 - 0.476 Am/e=58 - 2.88 - Am~e 98. Quantitative determination of CO was impossible since the fragment m/e=28 is found in the mass spectra of nearly all reaction products. The degree of butane conversion was obtained from the ratio of the areas of the butane peaks after reaction and without reaction (reactor filled with inert corundum). Yields could not be calculated since it was impossible to produce a suitable MA/Ne calibrating mixture because of the low vapour pressure of MA at room temperature. In case of the experiments with 1802 the oxygenated products were identified according to their 180 content by the following molecular ions: CO (m/e=30), CO2 (m/e=46,48), furan (m/e=70) and MA (m/e= 100,102,104). From the proportions of the molecular ions related to the 180/160 distribution the relative amounts were calculated for each oxygen containing product assuming a similar sensitivity and fragmentation for all isotopic isomers. E.g., the relative content of MA containing three 180 atoms is equal to the intensity of the molecular ion with m/e=104 in relation to the sum of the intensities of the ions with m/e=98,100,102 and 104. 3. Results Results of transient experiments are presented with respect to reaction inter- mediates and to the type of reaction mechanism operating in different steps of the reaction chain from butane to MA. In the latter experiments the nature of oxygen species involved was studied applying 1802 as an oxygen source. 3. I. Reaction intermediates To determine reaction intermediates butane was oxidized under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. When pulsing pure butane or mixtures of butane and oxygen (C4:O2 = 1 : 1, 1 : 4, and 1 : 8) over the catalyst at 420 butenes, butadiene, furan, MA and CO2 were detected at the reactor outlet. Furthermore, the degree of conversion of butane and the relative yields of MA and the intermediate products were nearly independent on the C4 : 02 ratio in the feed. The same products were observed while passing a continuous flow of the mixture of reactants over the catalyst. The shapes of the characteristic response signals of the detected products obtained in the pulse experiments differ from each other. While butane behaved similar to an inert gas the product peak maxima of the other substances are shifted 208 U.

This order is the same and the shapes of the response signals are similar to the one observed in comparable experiments by Gleaves et al. [7]. 3.2. Interaction of oxygen with the catalyst 1802 was pulsed over the catalyst at temperatures between 350 and 680 in order to investigate the interaction of oxygen with the catalyst. To adjust the state of the catalyst similar to butane oxidation conditions, a mixture of butane/1602 (1 : 4) was fed to the catalyst for 2 min prior to each experiment. While pulsing 1802 over the catalyst, part of it was incorporated in the catalyst as described in Fig. 1. With increasing temperature the oxygen conversion increased reaching nearly 100% at about 650. At a temperature of 420, which was applied for the C4 oxidation experiments described below, about 40% of the oxygen (ca. 5.1015 molecules t802 per pulse) were consumed by the catalyst causing a partial oxidation of the surface. No response signals at masses 32 and 34 were obtained indicating that no significant oxygen exchange could be observed under the conditions of the transient method applied. 3.3.

In these experiments primarily the 180 content in MA formed was studied. While pulsing mixtures of substrates and 1802 over the catalyst the proportion of the different MA molecules resulting from different oxygen species 180/160 incorporated changes with the amount of gas mixtures pulsed. In the oxidation of the three substrate molecules mentioned very similar results were obtained. The results are shown in Table 1 and Figs. 2-4. As an example, the results obtained in the conversion of furan (1802 : C4H40=5.9 : 1; 420) are depicted. Fig. 2 shows the resulting proportions of the MA molecules with the four different oxygen isotope combinations obtained as a function of the number of furan molecules pulsed. On increasing the amount of furan plus 1802 pulsed the proportion of the MA containing more 180 increased, i.e., the proportion of MA with m/e=98 decreased with increasing pulse number, the proportion of m/e= 100 went through a maximum and the proportion of MA containing two (m/e=102) and three 180 (m/e= 104) increased with pulse number. While the amount of MA consisted of 93% m/e=98 and 7% m/e=100 in the average for the first 64 pulses, a complex mixture of about 10% m/e=98, 10% m/e= 100, 60% m/e-102 and 20% m/e= 104 was obtained after pulsing 102molecules C4H40/gcat. However, extrapolating the results to the first pulse almost only MA with m/e=98 could be detected. The appearance of the m/e=104 related to MA containing only 180 in the molecule indicated that under reaction conditions chosen the 160 originally present in the furan molecule fed was exchanged. The shape of the MA response signals, i.e., their residence time distribution in the reactor, was independent of the proportion of the different oxygen isotopes in the MA molecules.

The comparatively high value of 15% for butane oxidation is probably caused by the influence of the low signal-to-noise ratio for the very small peak with m/e= 100: U.

Numeric integration of this peak with a long drawn-out tailing leads to a too high peak area. The reaction step butadiene ~ furan was studied by converting a butadiene:1802=l :3.3 mixture at 420. As depicted in Fig. 3 the furan responses obtained from the first pulses of butadiene contained mostly 160 (95% of m/e=68) and only traces of 180 (5% of m/e=70). Continuation of pulsing showed that with increasing pulse number the lSo content in the furan molecules rose; after 5.1019 molecules of butadiene were fed the proportions of the furan molecules obtained amounted to 60% (180) and 40% (~60). Using a feed of butane/1802 (1 : 1.1) at 440 provided similar results of furan formation (93% of m/e=68 and 7% of m/e---70). A comparison of the shapes of the furan responses shows that the curves at m/e=68 and m/e=70 were very similar. To study the mechanism of total oxidation the CO2 formation during multipulse reaction of butane, butadiene and furan with ~So2 was monitored. As an example, CO2 formation from a mixture of furan with ~802 (1 : 4.9) at 420 is presented in Fig. 4. The pattern of the curves exhibits that with the first pulses a proportion of about 20% of m/e=46 (C~60180) was detected. With increasing amount of furarff1802 mixture pulsed the proportion of CO2 containing more 180 increased analogously to the formation of 180 containing MA molecules: The proportion of CO2 with m/e=44 decreased with increasing pulse number, the proportion of m/e=46 went through a maximum and the proportion CO2 with m/e=48 enhanced continuously. After pulsing 102molecules C4H40/gcat a mixture of about 10% CO2 with m/e=44, 40% CO2 with m/e=46 212 U. Rodemerck et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 203-216 and of 50% CO2 with m/e=48 was formed. Similar results were obtained by oxidation of butane and butadiene: Pulsing a mixture of butane and 1802 (1 1.1) over the catalyst proportions of 66% of m/e=44, 25% of m/e=46 and 9% of rrde=48 were measured averaging the first 30 pulses. The 180 content of MA measured immediately after that with the same feed and the same catalyst amounted to only 15%. Additional information about the mechanism of CO2 formation can be derived from the shapes of the TAP responses (Fig.5). If single pulses of pure butane were dosed onto a fresh catalyst, a broad CO2 peak of m/e=44 resulted (A). Pulsing a mixture of butane/1802 (1 1.1) over the catalyst narrow peaks of the 180 containing CO2 molecules with the nu'e=46 (B) and 48 (C), respectively, were obtained besides this broad peak of m/e=44. Afterwards butane was pulsed once more. Broad peaks of both m/e=44 (similar to (A)) and m/e=46 (D) were measured now. 4. Discussion Firstly, the above results are discussed with respect to intermediate products and compared to previous results. Afterwards, the role of different oxygen species, i.e., lattice versus loosely bonded oxygen, is elucidated for the different intermediate reaction steps of the oxidation of butane. 4.1. Formation of intermediates and carbon oxides Butenes, butadiene, furan and MA were detected as selective reaction products of the butane oxidation with 02. Contrary to the results of Ebner and Gleaves [5] who found that MA formation could no longer be observed when the O2:C4Hlo ratio was below 4 : 1 no influence of the butane to oxygen ratio in the feed on the formation of these products could be detected. Additionally, on pulsing butane in the absence of gas phase oxygen all products mentioned could also be detected. These differences may be explained by the very small degree of butane conversion (ca. 1%) in the experiments described in [7] which could make it impossible to detect the very small amounts of products formed, whereas in the above experiments the conversion degree of butane amounted to about 20%. In the oxidation of butadiene furan and MA were observed as selective oxidation products whereas the oxidation of furan led to MA. CO2 was formed as a non- selective product in the oxidation of butane, butadiene, dihydrofuran and furan, respectively; CO which was also produced could not be determined for analytical reasons. These findings indicate that butane oxidation follows a reaction mechan- ism with consecutive steps which occurs via the intermediates butenes, butadiene and furan and that from all these intermediates non-selective side reactions to the carbon oxides seem to be possible. U. Rodemerck et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 203-216 213 4.2. Role of oxygen in the selective reaction pathways It is generally agreed that butane activation is the rate determining step in butane oxidation [3]. The finding that the conversion degree of butane was nearly independent on the ratio of butane to oxygen in the feed indicates that butane activation does not need adsorbed oxygen contradictory to the conclusion pre- viously drawn in literature [7]. The discussion of the results obtained in the oxidation of 1802-containing feeds over a 1602-containing catalyst takes into account that the content of the different oxygen isotopes in the reaction products at the beginning of pulsing allows to discriminate the source of oxygen inserted and, therefore, the operating reaction mechanism with respect to oxygen. If the product molecules contain mainly 180 after the first pulses this oxygen should stem from adsorbed ISo species or gaseous ~802 molecules. In other words: A redox mechanism must operate if only 160 is inserted in the reaction products at the beginning of pulsing a substrate/1802 mixture onto the catalyst which contains exclusively 160. The results on the oxidation of butane, butadiene and furan with 1802 depicted in an exemplary fashion in Table 1 and Figs. 2 and 3 indicate that neither adsorbed nor gas phase oxygen plays a marked role in MA formation from butane and the intermediates butadiene and furan as seen by the extrapolation of the curves m/ e=100 (Fig. 2) and m/e=70 (Fig. 3) to the first pulses of furan and butadiene, respectively. Only 7%, 9% and less than 15% of MA containing 180 (m/e=100) were formed and no MA with m/e= 102 could be detected at the onset of reacting furan, butadiene and butane, respectively, with 1802. With respect to MA mole- cules containing only one 180 atom it may be argued that this oxygen could also be surface oxygen formed by the oxidation with 1802 of both the original surface and the surface reduced by the first substrate molecules. This is concluded by the experiments on oxygen exchange and catalyst oxidation which showed that the catalyst oxidation cannot be neglected. Gleaves et al. [7] used sequential pulse TAP experiments where oxygen and butane were fed with a time lag of 0.1 and 600 ms, respectively, to investigate the type of oxygen involved in the mechanism. In the first case (0.1 ms) the peak area of MA formed was nearly 25% larger in comparison with the second case (600 ms). The authors concluded from these experiments that short living adsorbed oxygen species take part in the selective reaction to MA. According to our experimental results this finding can be interpreted as follows: As a consequence of introducing oxygen pulses into the catalyst bed V4ions on the surface are oxidized forming V5+ centres and oxide ions. If butane is fed after a short time, MA is formed in high selectivity on these newly created centres with a high oxidation potential (see also [ 14-16]). If the delay between the two pulses is longer a distribution of these highly active and selective centres between the surface and subsurface layers can occur resulting in a decrease of the selectivity of the catalyst surface. Thus, a smaller amount of MA is formed. 214 U. Rodemerck et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 203-216 1 A i 0,4 C i0,2 e~ 0 0,5 1 1,5 t [sl Fig. 5.

Role of oxygen in the non-selective pathways The results on CO2 formation by total oxidation reactions of butane and the intermediates butadiene and furan differ from those obtained for the selective reaction pathways in the degree of the formation of 180 labelled molecules at initial pulsing. When passing the very first butane/1802 pulses over the catalyst 25% CO2 molecules with m/e=46 and 9% CO2 with m/e=48 are formed demonstrating that 180 is incorporated in the CO2 molecule to a certain extent. Therefore, it can be concluded that CO2 is formed not only by redox steps. Two reaction paths allowing the formation of CO2 at different time scales seem to be possible: In a fast reaction adsorbed oxygen (180) reacts with the substrate molecules to fast desorbing CO2 which forms narrow CO2 peaks (m/e=46 and m/e=48) as shown in Fig. 5. Simultaneously, in a slower process CO2 (m/e=44) is formed by reaction with lattice oxygen (160) resulting in a broader peak. This interpretation is based upon the results of subsequent feeding of butane pulses after dosing initially pulses of butane/180s over the catalyst. These experiments showed that the anaerob butane oxidation led to broad peaks of m/e=46 besides broad peaks of m/e=44. The former finding can be explained by formation of C160180 via insertion of catalyst lattice 1802- and 1602-- and by slow desorption of these molecules. The slow desorption process assumed may be ascribed to the increasing basicity of the low- valent vanadium ions obtained by the conversion of the C4 molecules to CO2 in the reduction step of an operating redox mechanism which should result in a stronger adsorption and, consequently, slower desorption of the acidic product CO2. Thus, U. Rodemerck et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 203-216 215 both redox and reaction steps including adsorbed oxygen species probably contribute to CO2 formation from C4 substrates. These findings are in agreement with the results of Ebner and Gleaves [5] who also found that two types of oxygen are involved in the non-selective pathways to CO2. 5. Conclusions Transient experiments in vacuum confirmed the selective oxidation of butane to MA over (VO)2PzO7 to be a consecutive reaction comprising the intermediates butenes, butadiene and furan in accordance with the results of other authors [7]. The difference to ambient pressure operation under oxygen excess conditions where no intermediates can be observed may be explained by the high vacuum of the TAP operation allowing a faster desorption and, hence, detection of inter- mediates. Further, from the analogy to the results of the experiments under oxygen deficient conditions [4] it may be concluded that no pressure gap exists and that the mechanism proposed from TAP results should also be valid under ambient pressure conditions. The oxidation with l So2 showed that a redox mechanism operates in all selective reaction steps including the formation of MA from furan which was under controversial discussion up to now [8]. The formation of the total oxidation product CO2, on the contrary, is accounted for by a mechanism including both redox steps and steps in which adsorbed oxygen is involved. This explains the higher MA selectivity which may be obtained in a riser reactor in which gaseous oxygen is excluded from taking part in the selective oxidation process. Therefore, the results presented are conclusive and allow to decide the controversy between the conclusions from earlier TAP experiments [5-8] and the evidence from other methods in favour to latter ones: In the selective conversion of butane to MA on (VO)2P207 only lattice oxygen and no adsorbed oxygen is involved.
