The yields of the main products (methane and methanol) were higher with the 254 nm lamp than with the 365 lamp while no products were observed with the 400 nm lamp. This was because the electron-hole generation rate in- creased with increasing energy of irradiation (decreasing wavelength) and there were higher densities of electron states at higher energies in TiO 2 . The increased efficiency of electron-hole generation with a shorter wavelength irradiation increased the efficiency of the catalyst. The energy of the electrons excited by visible light (400 nm) was too low for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. Key words: silver doping; titania; carbon dioxide reduction; photocatalysis; wavelength Carbon dioxide emission into the atmosphere is one of the most serious causes of the greenhouse effect. Therefore efforts are made to find effective methods to convert CO 2 into useful compounds. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with H 2 O is one of the most desirable and challenging goals in environment protection [1â€“23]. The semiconductor photocatalytic process is based on the combined use of low energy UV light and a semiconductor photocatalyst, with the anatase form of TiO 2 being the most suitable. In general, photoinduced electrons (e ) and positive holes (h + ) are produced from TiO 2 under the irradiation of UV light (Èœ < 380 nm) because this has an energy larger than the band gap (3.2 eV) of TiO 2 . The photon flux necessary to initiate these processes can be supplied by sunlight or lamps. Mercury and xenon lamps are the most commonly used lamps to gen- erate UV radiation. Matthews et al. [24] compared the excitation of TiO 2 under light of wavelengths of 254 and 350 nm. The shorter wave- length radiation of 254 nm was significantly more effective in promoting the photocatalytic oxidation of salicylic acid and phenol. Hu et al. [25] investigated the photodegradation of phenol under UV light at Èœ < 330 nm and Èœ < 200 nm and re- ported better results with 200 nm irradiation. Cao et al. [26] studied photocatalytic degradation of chlorfenapyr using two different monochromatic UV irradiations (300 and 350 nm) and determined that the shorter radiation was more efficient. Jeong et al. [27] evaluated photocatalytic degradation of gaseous toluene using 365, 254 and 254 and 185 nm irradiation in the presence of a TiO 2 catalyst. The highest conversion and mineralization were obtained with 254 and 185 nm light. Bayarri et al. [28] investigated the wavelength effect in photolysis and heterogeneous photocatalysis. A detailed com- parison of the efficiency of UV-A and UV-ABC in photocata- lytic and photolytic degradation was done using sulfameth- oxazole (SMOX) and 2,4-dichlorphenol (DCP) as model pol- lutants. It was shown that UV-ABC radiation was more effec- tive than UV-A. Chu et al. [29] evaluated the photocatalytic degradation of dicamba using two different monochromatic K. KOÃ½Ã� et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 812â€“815 UV irradiation (300 and 350 nm). The photocatalysis rate constant was higher with 300 nm irradiation than with 350 nm irradiation. Zhang et al. [30] studied the photocatalytic degra- dation of pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) using UV irradia- tion wavelengths of 254, 310, and 365 nm. The photocatalytic degradation rates of BaP in the presence of TiO 2 followed the order of 254 nm irradiation > 310 nm irradiation > 365 nm irradiation, while those of pyrene followed the order of 310 nm irradiation > 365 nm irradiation > 254 nm irradiation. Wong et al. [31] studied the photocatalytic degradation of alachlor with different UV lamps (254, 300, and 350 nm). The best quantum yield was obtained with the 300 nm lamp, followed by that at 350 nm and finally at 254 nm. Tan et al. [32] investigated photocatalytic reduction on TiO 2 of CO 2 in the gas phase with different UV lamps. A switching from UVC (253.7 nm) to UVA (365 nm) resulted in a significant decrease in methane yield. This showed that an increase wavelength of UV irradiation significantly decreased the product yield. Tseng et al. [33] performed CO 2 photocatalytic reduction in the liquid phase with different UV lamps (254 and 365 nm) on TiO 2 , and ob- served a similar phenomenon. A switch to UVA (365 nm) re- sulted in a significant decrease of methanol yield. The effect of different wavelengths on a Ag-doped TiO 2 on CO 2 photocatalytic reduction performed in the liquid phase with suspended catalysts, and with the products in both phases analyzed, has not yet been studied. The aim of this work is to assess the effect of wavelength (254, 365, and 400 nm) on the photocatalytic reactivity of Ag/TiO 2 exemplified by the photoreduction of CO 2 by water. The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in our experiments used a CO 2 saturated liquid phase with suspended Ag/TiO 2 catalyst powder. The products in both the liquid and gas phase were analyzed. 1 Experimental Pure TiO 2 and silver-enriched TiO 2 powders were prepared by the sol-gel process in a reverse micellar environment. Pure TiO 2 was synthesized by the addition of titanium (IV) isopro- poxide (Ti(OCH(CH 3 ) 2 ) 4 , Aldrich, 99.999%) into an inverse micellar solution made of cyclohexane (Aldrich, Â• 99.9%, HPLC grade), non-ionic surfactant Triton X-114 (C 27 H 48 O 7.5 , Aldrich), and distilled water. The molar ratio of cyclohex- ane:Triton X-114:water:Ti(OC 3 H 7 ) 4 was kept at 11:1:1:1 (volume ratio TX-114:cyclohexane = 0.49). The beaker with the solution made of the appropriate amount of cyclohexane, Triton X-114, and water was stirred vigorously for 15 min for homogenization and formation of inverse micelles. After the addition of all the isopropoxide, the sol was stirred for another 10 min. The sol was left in a bowl exposed to air for 24 h. The rigid gel obtained was calcined at 400 Â°C for 4 h in an air flow in a muffle furnace. Ag-enriched TiO 2 was similarly prepared, but with using a AgNO 3 (Aldrich, 99.9999%) solution of suitable concentration (1.85 mol/L) instead of distilled water [34]. The crystalline phase of the sample was determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area of catalyst was evaluated by the multipoint BET method from N 2 physical adsorption isotherms. A UV-Vis spectrophotometer was used to record the diffuse reflectance spectra of the sample. The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was carried out in a batch stirred annular reactor with suspended catalyst powder illuminated separately by 8 W Hg lamps of 254 and 365 nm and a 8 W Hg lamp filled with argon (400 nm) (Fig. 1). A liquid phase of 0.2 mol/L NaOH and catalyst loading of 1 g/L was used. GC/FID/TCD was used for the analysis of gas and Fig. 1. Schematic of the apparatus for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. K. KOÃ½Ã� et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 812â€“815 liquid reaction products. The details of the preparation and characterization of the Ag/TiO 2 catalyst, and descriptions of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction experiment and analytical methods have been previously described [34,35]. 2 Results and discussion The textural properties and absorption edge of the prepared pure TiO 2 and Ag-doped titania samples are given in Table 1, together with the actual Ag content. The samples had a rela- tively high surface area, and the positive effect of silver was evident. XRD analysis confirmed the presence of the anatase structure while Ag was not detected, which indicated that Ag was present as metallic clusters inside the TiO 2 powder. The UV-Vis spectra of the catalysts showed an absorption shift to the visible region for the Ag-TiO 2 catalysts [34]. The effect of irradiation time on the formation of CO 2 photocatalytic reduction products was investigated with vari- ous wavelengths of radiation for periods of 0â€“24 h. Two main products were obtained, which were methane in the gas phase and methanol in the liquid phase. Hydrogen and low amounts of carbon monoxide were also detected. Other products such as formic acid, formaldehyde, ethane, and ethylene could also be formed [14] but they were not detected. Methane and methanol produced versus irradiation time with wavelengths of 254, 365, and 400 nm for the Ag/TiO 2 catalyst are shown in Fig. 2 and 3. A substantial increase of methane yield was observed after 8 h of irradiation with the 254 nm lamp on the Ag/TiO 2 catalyst (Fig. 2). The methane yield over the pure TiO 2 catalyst with the 254 nm lamp was markedly less than over Ag/TiO 2 . The yields of methane were significantly lower with the 365 nm lamp than with the 254 nm lamp and the values obtained were almost the same for the two catalysts. The yields of methanol with the 400 nm lamp were one order of magnitude lower than the yields of methane over the Ag/TiO 2 catalyst (Fig. 3). Data at 5 h were measured but these were below the limit of detection (12 È�g/L or 0.38 È�mol/g). The yields of methanol for the shorter radiation wavelength were higher and comparable with the yield of methane. Therefore CH 3 OH yields for the 400 nm lamp for both methane and methanol were not measured. Pure TiO 2 has a relative large energy band gap and can only be excited by high energy UV irradiation with a short wave- length (UVA). Efforts have been made to extend the light ab- sorption range of TiO 2 from UV to visible light by adding noble metals. In this work the material used (Ag/TiO 2 ) has an ab- sorption edge of 2.74 eV, so this catalyst was expected to be active with irradiation of a longer wavelength Vis or at least UVC. Unfortunately, electrons excited by visible light do not have sufficient energy for the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 since the Ag energy levels were probably under the TiO 2 con- duction band edge. The increased activity of TiO 2 with incor- porated Ag [34] was probably not caused by a decreased ab- sorption edge, but the more probable reason was a decreased carrier recombination rate due to the spatial separation of electrons and holes in the surrounding Ag clusters. The Ag content of 5.2% comprised silver atoms that were not randomly located in the TiO 2 crystal, but that probably formed metallic clusters inside the TiO 2 powder [34]. These metal clusters would cause a decrease in the electron-hole recombination rate [36â€“40]. The Fermi level of TiO 2 is higher than that of silver metal [41]. Some works have shown that the composite of two kinds of semiconductors or two phases of the same semiconductor was beneficial in reducing the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, and thus enhanced photocatalytic activity.

KOÃ½Ã� et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 812â€“815 The interface between the two phases probably act to rapidly separate the photogenerated electrons and holes due to the difference in the energy levels of their conduction bands and valence bands [42â€“44]. The electron-hole generation rate increased considerably with increasing energy of irradiation (i.e. decreasing wave- length) due to the higher densities of electron states at higher energies in TiO 2 [45,46]. The increased efficiency of elec- tron-hole generation increased the efficiency of the catalyst when a shorter wavelength irradiation was used. Our results are in agreement with other works on CO 2 photocatalytic reduction on TiO 2 catalyst initiated by UV sources with different wave- lengths [32,33]. 3 Conclusions The photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 in the presence of Ag/TiO 2 and TiO 2 catalysts under separate illumination by lamps of 254, 365, and 400 nm wavelength was studied. The radiation with the shorter wavelength of 254 nm was signifi- cantly more effective for CO 2 photoreduction than the 365 nm radiation, which was expected to be better from the Ag/TiO 2 band gap (2.74 eV). The increased efficiency of electron-hole generation with the shorter wavelength of irradiation increased the efficiency of the catalyst. The radiation with the wave- length of 400 nm was not effective at all, probably because the energy of electrons excited by visible light (400 nm) was too low for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.

San Diego: Academic Press, 1990 by lamps of 254, 365, and 400 nm wavelength was studied. The radiation with the shorter wavelength of 254 nm was signifi- cantly more effective for CO 2 photoreduction than the 365 nm radiation, which was expected to be better from the Ag/TiO 2 band gap (2.74 eV). The increased efficiency of electron-hole generation with the shorter wavelength of irradiation increased the efficiency of the catalyst. The radiation with the wave- length of 400 nm was not effective at all, probably because the energy of electrons excited by visible light (400 nm) was too low for CO 2 photocatalytic reduction.

Tel: +420-596-991-592; Fax: +420-59-691-8592 Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 by water was performed in the presence of a Ag/TiO2 catalyst under illumination by lamps with different wavelengths (254, 365, and 400 nm). The yields of the main products (methane and methanol) were higher with the 254 nm lamp than with the 365 lamp while no products were observed with the 400 nm lamp. This was because the electron-hole generation rate increased with increasing energy of irradiation (decreasing wavelength) and there were higher densities of electron states at higher energies in TiO2. The increased efficiency of electron-hole generation with a shorter wavelength irradiation increased the efficiency of the catalyst. The energy of the electrons excited by visible light (400 nm) was too low for CO2 photocatalytic reduction. Graphical abstract A Ag/TiO2 catalyst was used under illumination of different wavelengths for CO2 photocatalytic reduction by water. Methane and methanol yields were higher with 254 nm light than with 365 nm light while no products were observed with 400 nm light.
