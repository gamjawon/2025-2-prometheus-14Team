QUIGNARD, M. LECONTE and J. M. BASSET Institut de Recherches sur la Catalyse, C. N. R. S., 2, avenue Albert Einstein, 69626 Villeurbanne Cedex (France) Summary Two types of tungsten phenoxide catalysts have been synthesized; viz. CWO-^O^ (A) and Cl4W(0-/Q^2 (B), respectively. When associated with CzHgAlClz, these precursor complexes exhibit a fair and an extremely high catalytic activity for A and B respectively. Within each series there is a relationship between activity and stereoselectivity, the most active catalysts being those which are the least stereoselective with a limiting value of unity for the translcis ratio of the products. The results are explained on the basis of a simple theory which corre- lates the activity and the stereoselectivity with the respective energy levels of the metallacyclobutane complex and of the metallacarbene-olefin complex. Introduction We have recently proposed a simple theory which accounts for the metathesis stereochemistry of any cyclic and acyclic olefin [1]. The theory is based on the relative energy levels of the various intermediate steps in the reaction pathway. In particular, the stereochemistry is governed mainly by the relative energy of the metallacyclobutane complex with respect to that of the metallacarbene-olefin complex (Fig. 1). If the metallacarbene-olefin complex has an energy which is smaller than that of the two possible metallacyclobutanes which lead respectively to the cis and trans isomers, the resulting stereoselectivity will be governed by the energy levels of these two metallacycles. If the coordinated olefin has an energy which is higher than that of the metallacyclobutane, the stereochem- istry will not be governed by the energy levels of the metallacycle and the system will lose its stereoselectivity and yield a trans/cis ratio of unity. The parameters which may modify the respective energy levels of the intermediates are the transition metal [2], the ring strain in the cyclic cis- or trans-olefin [3], the nature of the substituents on the acyclic olefins [2, 4], 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 28 RI^ ,Ra R3 \"2 ^=^ 'CHssCH^ ^. + l-nM== -\" ^\"S,, /-,_____ 3 'i i i Ri '; \"1 '-' ^=\\ LnM^^ ;; ^\"2 1 ',' l-n ==\\ \"3 . :. \"3 ^CH-CH-\"2 ^-^^^\"^ 'S^CH-\"2 ,'.

This last parameter is difficult to evaluate since it is impossible to know if a given ligand remains coordinated to the precursor complex during propagation. Nevertheless some recent results by Dodd et al. [6] with Cl2W(O^Q))4, as well as our own results using substituted phenols [7], indicate that the nature of the sub- stituent on the ring has a profound effect on the resulting activity. It was therefore logical to check whether or not there is a relationship between the activity and the stereoselectivity with this class of catalysts; a priori one would expect the more active catalyst to be the less stereoselective and vice versa. Experimental The precursor complexes Cl2W(0 ^(^l))4, with the number of sub- ' -Rn stituents n on the phenoxy ligand being 0, 1 or 2, were prepared according to the procedure described by Funk and Baumann [8], and were character- ized by elemental analyses for C, H, W, Cl when the phenoxy ligands % <g)^-0, (p^-O, <C^-0, CH3-<C^-0 and t-Bu^C^O CHa CHa were employed. 29 A new class of precursor complex C^v^O ^C^l))^ was also pre- pared in a similar manner to those above (reaction of WC4 + 2 mol equiv of substituted phenol [9]). Elemental analyses of these materials gave Cl the following results. Anal. calc. for CWO-^O^: C, 22.18; H, 0.93; Cl Cl, 43.6; W, 28.3. Found C, 22.3; H, 1.3; Cl, 42.7; W, 28.1.

Found Me C, 31.55; H, 3.15; Cl, 24.4; W, 31.55. Results All the complexes are active in cis-2-pentene metathesis in association with an organo-aluminium co-catalyst (Fig. 2). The stereoselectivities have been determined by plotting the trans/cis ratio of the olefin versus the trans/cis ratio for the olefin [2]. The extrapolated values obtained for a translcis ratio equal to zero for the olefin are given in Table 1 for the Cl2W(0-<'Q^4 catalysts. From this table it will be seen that the activities vary according to the order: R = H > 3-Me > 3,5-di-Me > 4-Me > 4-t-Bu. Generally speaking, the most active catalysts are those which possess the most acidic ligands and exhibit the lowest stereoselectivities. However, even with the unsubstituted phenoxy ligand, which gives the highest activity, the corresponding stereo- selectivity is far removed from unity, indicating that the metallacyclic com- plex has a higher energy than the metallacarbene-olefin complex (Fig. 1). X The disubstituted complexes Cl4W(0 J\\)2 (X = Cl, Br) were found to X be extremely active in cis-2-pentene metathesis (as well as a-olefins and functionalized olefins [9]). The corresponding stereoselectivity is extremely low since the translcis ratio for the olefin was 0.9, indicating an almost 30 10 TOO (\"\"nT Fig. 2.

In the same series, when X = Me the activity was found to be extremely small, and the corresponding Stereoselectivity (trans/cis ratio = 0.65) was one of the smallest observed in this series (Table 2). Conclusions From this preliminary work it appears that for a given series of pre- cursor complexes and for comparable reaction conditions, there is a general rule according to which the more active catalysts are the less stereoselective and vice versa. In general, a trans/cis ratio of unity indicates an extremely active catalyst and conversely a high Stereoselectivity apparently indicates poor catalytic activity. Although we have no general proof, we suggest that the stereochemistry is probably the most reliable and reproducible tool in any comparison of the activity of various catalytic systems. This observation of a relationship between activity and Stereoselectivity may be deduced logically from our previous theory [1].
