Tel.: +49-228-73-7871; fax: +49-228-73-9424 As an intermediate form between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, catalysts based on transition metal colloids have drawn a lot of attention in recent years. Mating advantages from different concepts of catalysis, they turn out to be highly active, selective, and, in addition, easily separated from other reaction components. Even though colloidal catalysts are widely used in conventional solvents, hardly anything is known about their reactivity in supercritical fluids such as supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2). Furthermore, scCO2 is an especially attractive, non-toxic, and environmentally benign solvent for chemical reactions. When hydrogenations were conducted using polymer-supported colloidal Pd nanoparticles as catalysts in scCO2, we found turnover frequencies (TOFs) as high as 4000000h−1 even at a reasonably low hydrogen pressures of 15bar and temperatures of 50°C. To our surprise, their reactivity turned out to be much higher than those of most other catalysts reported in the literature. The kinetics of their catalytic reactions in supercritical fluids has been investigated using in situ NMR in combination with a toroid cavity autoclave (TCA). Keywords Supercritical carbon dioxide Turnover frequency Toroid cavity autoclave Colloidal catalysis 1 Introduction In recent years, catalytic reactions involving supercritical fluids have drawn substantial attention in both industrial applications and basic research [1,2]. Ever since the early work of Rathke et al. [3] and Jessop et al. [4], several advantages have been reported about catalysis in supercritical media, and individual hydrogenations and hydroformylations were conducted in supercritical fluids, whereby both heterogeneous [5] and homogeneous catalysts have been used. [6–8] Especially, supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) is valued as a modern solvent for it is environmentally benign, nontoxic, readily available, and inexpensive. Diffusivities in scCO2 are higher and viscosities lower as compared to conventional organic solvents. Prominently, gases are completely and fast miscible with scCO2 at all ratios. In addition, the dissolution properties vary with the supercritical density. (Fig. 1 shows the pressure dependence of the density of carbon dioxide at various temperatures above and below the critical temperature, T c. In a typical experiments, the temperature is set to T=50°C, the pressure to p=150bar, yielding a density d of about 0.65g/cm3.) Hence, subsequent separation of the starting materials, reaction products, and catalyst from the solvent CO2 is easily achieved through temperature or pressure changes. Once a reaction is finished and the CO2 has been vented, the only task left is to separate the catalyst from the product and, eventually, from remnant starting material. Colloidal catalysts dissolved in scCO2 pose an interesting alternative, since they are readily extracted by ultra-filtration or vacuum distillation. Yet, colloidal catalysts are believed to show lesser activity in supercritical media, and so far their applications have practically been limited to bi-phasic systems [9]. Combining the two attractive concepts of modern homogeneous catalysis, namely using colloidal catalysts in combination with supercritical fluids as the solvent, it is possible to obtain products in high purity with only traces of remnant solvent or catalyst. In this contribution, we report the fast and highly efficient, single-phase hydrogenation of alkynes in scCO2 mediated by a polymer-supported colloid catalyst in which catalytically active, bimetallic Pd/Au nanoparticles are situated in block copolymer micelles of polystyrene-block-poly-4-vinylpyridine. The catalyst is obtained via living anionic block-copolymerization [10] with simultaneous reduction of suitable metal salts. Structural studies have shown that the surfaces of the nanoparticle consist exclusively of Pd while Au forms the cores. 1 Structure and properties of bimetallic colloids formed in polystyrene-block-poly-4-vinylpyridine micelles: catalytic activity in selective hydrogenation of dehydrolinalool. Characteristic data of the polymer: M n =19400,M w =22500, relative 4-vinylpyridine content X 4-VP=0.34, micelle size 12nm, bimetallic particle size 2nm. The colloid catalyst is suspended in toluene with a Pd concentration of 6.6mmoll−1, see [11]. 1 The reactions were carried out and investigated in situ with the toroid cavity autoclave (TCA) NMR technology according to Woelk et al. and Rathke et al. [12–14]. The TCA 2 A more detailed description of the TCA for in situ NMR in supercritical fluids will be given elsewhere, see [16]. 2 is a cylindrical autoclave that also functions as a toroid cavity NMR detector. It allows us to quantitatively monitor the starting material and the products without disturbing or quenching the reaction, and to evaluate reaction rates and turn over frequencies (TOFs) accordingly [15]. Fig. 2 shows the time dependence of the NMR signals for the hydrogenation of phenyl ethyne to styrene and the hydrogenation of the latter to ethyl benzene (left axis). The curves follow classical A-to-B and B-to-C kinetics, which are nicely obtained applying the TCA and in situ NMR. The conversion (right axis, Fig. 2) is determined from the consumption of the starting material phenyl ethyne. To outline the general utility of this method, only the first step of this reaction is used for the analysis of the TOF and to monitor the reaction progress. Since this particular catalyst was originally developed for hydrogenation of alkynes, i.e., the stereoselective hydrogenation of dehydrolinalol to linalol (see footnote 2) in toluene at ambient pressure, the following substrates were used in this investigation: 1-hexyne, 3-methyl-3-hydroxy 1-pentyne, 3,3-dimethyl 1-butyne, phenyl ethyne, and 1-phenyl 3-propyne. This set was chosen to represent different electronic and sterical properties, which will allow us to obtain some indirect information about the catalyst and the coordination of the substrate to the active site of the catalyst and about its efficiency toward different substrates. The substance 3-methyl-3-hydroxy 1-pentyne was chosen to mimic the dehydrolinalol hydrogenation. The experiments described in the following will demonstrate the very fast hydrogenation of the substrate by this colloidal catalyst dispersed in scCO2. In our opinion, this example opens up new ways for modern catalysis, since this method yields products of high purity at very high reaction rates. 2 Experimental For all investigated reactions, the procedure is as follows. The TCA (sample volume=2.8ml) was charged with 100μl of the substrate (between 0.80 and 0.90mmol, depending on molar mass of the substrate) and 20μl of the colloid catalyst (0.132μmol Pd) suspended in toluene. A substrate-to-catalyst ratio (SCR) of about 6500 is calculated from the nominal amount of Pd in the catalyst; however, for steric reasons, only a portion of Pd can be catalytically active at one time, i.e., several Pd atoms need to form an “active site” (vide infra). In the experiments with higher SCRs for the hydrogenation of 1-hexyne, the amount of catalyst was reduced along with the increase of substrate. After the TCA is sealed, the reactive mixture is brought to a temperature of 50°C and pressurized with CO2 up to 150bar using a supercritical-fluid-extraction and HPLC syringe pump (ISCO). After allowing for a few minutes for the dissolution of the reactive components, the main magnetic field of the NMR magnet is shimmed for optimized homogeneity. Thereupon, typical line widths of 1–2Hz are achieved, even though the TCA is fabricated from a piece of a commercial (diamagnetic) copper alloy. Subsequently, hydrogen is added through an especially designed non-return valve, upon which the acquisition of the NMR spectra is started immediately. The pressures given for hydrogen do not represent the partial pressure within the supercritical mixture; rather, hydrogen is added to the carbon dioxide until a respective increase of the pressure (i.e., of 2–15bar) is reached. This change in pressure is called the “hydrogen pressure” from here on. We wish to point out that this follows common practice in high-pressure catalysis. In addition, experiments conducted previously by our group we have shown that pressures of carbon dioxide and hydrogen are almost additive at this pressure level. A macro program of the spectrometer provides for exact timing when acquiring consecutive spectra, which facilitates the analysis of the kinetics of the product formation. Typically, 50 spectra with an interim delay of 20s are recorded. With the integrated signal intensity of the alkyne proton of the substrates as a standard, NMR intensities were converted into concentrations. 3 Results and discussion At a hydrogen pressure of 15bar, a temperature of 50°C, and a carbon dioxide pressure of 150bar, our catalytic reactions reach TOFs of more then 4000000h−1 depending on the starting material, the hydrogen pressure, and the SCR. Accordingly, they are among the fastest known in catalysis. Considering the rather modest reaction conditions as employed here, these results are quite remarkable and not to be expected from current literature predictions in either homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis. Fig. 3 depicts the results for all substrates used at a hydrogen pressure of 15bar and 50°C as a bar plot; the TOFs were determined from the time of 50% conversion of the starting material. This procedure to determine the TOF follows common practice. The use of initial rates for the calculation of the TOF, which is also widely used, would lead to much higher values. An SCR of about 6500 (i.e., 20μl of colloidal catalyst dispersed in toluene, and about 100μl of the substrate) has been used in all cases. Since the molar masses of the substrate are slightly different, the SCR varies accordingly around an average value of 6500. In addition, it is noted that, in the calculation of the TOFs, the smallest reasonable active site was assumed. From a comparison between the Pd atom diameter and the spatial demand of our relatively small reactive acetylenes, we assume that this smallest site consists of at least seven Pd atoms, i.e., of one central atoms that is symmetrically surrounded by six other Pd atoms. Consequently, the TOFs reported here represent minimum values that could potentially be significantly higher, i.e., if an active site consists of more than seven Pd atoms [15]. A similar approach to visualize the catalytically active site on a surface of a nanoparticle was previously introduced by Besson et al. [17]. In the series of hydrogenations in which all five substrates described above were used, TOFs ranging from 100000 to more than 1000000h−1 were determined. Even our “slowest” reaction involving the sterically hindered 3,3-dimethyl 1-butyne proceeded much faster then any other known, i.e., for almost any substrate in conventional solvents, such as hexane or benzene. Fig. 4 shows the pressure dependence of the TOF for the hydrogenation of phenyl ethyne and 3-methyl-3-hydroxy 1-pentyne applying hydrogen pressures between 2 and 15bar. Again, only the consumption of the starting material is monitored and used in calculating the TOF at 50% conversion. Increasing the hydrogen pressure to above 15bar hardly increases the TOF in the reaction with either substrate, indicating that the concentration of hydrogen is not rate limiting. Our investigations of the dependence of the TOF on the substrate and pressure raise the question, how to increase the reaction rate even further: does the catalyst operate at its maximum capacity and how is that determined? Following classical kinetics, a reaction that is limited by the concentration of only one component is of pseudo first order with respect to that component. Furthermore, saturation of the catalyst occurs at high substrate concentrations, and a change in reaction order is anticipated with respect to the substrate. Hence, varying the SCR changes the order of the reaction from first to zero-th order. Fig. 5 shows the consumption of the starting material 1-hexyne (where the highest TOF was reached before, see Fig. 3), for different SCRs of 6600, 13200, and 19800. It is noted that both axis of the graph have been normalized to allow for comparison of the three plots in one graph. As is outlined, the TOF rises from about 1000000 to over 4000000h−1. To examine the progress of the reaction more clearly, the plots for an SCR of 6600 and 13200 are shown in Fig. 6 a and b, respectively. It follows from Fig. 6 that the decrease of the concentration of 1-hexyne with time follows an exponential function for an SCR of 6600. By contrast, using an SCR of about 13200, a linear change is observed for the time of the first six data points. This linear change indicates the change in pseudo reaction order. Fig. 6a and b also demonstrate the change in selectivity of the reaction, i.e., the time dependence of the formation of styrene is different for the two SCRs. Further investigations revealed that the reaction seems to be partially inhibited by aromatic compounds, such as styrene, ethyl benzene, or toluene. Hence, we feel that the reaction has even more potential for optimization and may lead to further increased TOFs. For example, the substitution of toluene as the dispersing solvent or the variation of the reaction conditions are most promising. 4 Conclusions The TOFs as determined here for these colloid-catalyzed hydrogenations in scCO2 at a moderate hydrogen pressure (15bar) are among the highest known in catalysis. They rank at least one order of magnitude above those reported for conventional solvents. Comparable but still up to an order of magnitude smaller values have so far only been reached in catalytic reactions conducted at higher temperatures, at much higher hydrogen pressures, or when carbon dioxide—i.e., the solvent—was directly hydrogenated [18]. In conclusion, we have identified and investigated an example of a highly efficient single-phase catalytic hydrogenation in scCO2 mediated by a polymer-supported colloidal catalyst. It is conceivable and even highly likely that colloidal catalysts in scCO2 will yield high TOFs in other catalytic cycles as well. Since for such high activity a high solubility of the catalyst in scCO2 is crucial [18,19], it follows from our data that this originally in toluene dispersed colloid catalyst must become directly dispersed in scCO2 during the course of this highly efficient hydrogenation. After the reaction is completed, the catalyst can readily be recovered by ultra-filtration, hence, the catalyst may be reused many times. Consequently, colloid catalysis in combination with the modern and environmentally benign solvent scCO2 can lead to ultra-fast catalytic reactions. Products demanding an especially high purity can be obtained through this elegant combination of a modern solvent with a modern catalyst. Lastly, it is noted that the colloid-stabilizing polymer did not need to be modified from its original formulation to enhance solubility in scCO2, whereas most other homogeneous catalysts have to be adapted via functionalization with highly fluorinated alkyl moieties [1].

        "dc:description": "As an intermediate form between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, catalysts based on transition metal colloids have drawn a lot of attention in recent years. Mating advantages from different concepts of catalysis, they turn out to be highly active, selective, and, in addition, easily separated from other reaction components. Even though colloidal catalysts are widely used in conventional solvents, hardly anything is known about their reactivity in supercritical fluids such as supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2). Furthermore, scCO2 is an especially attractive, non-toxic, and environmentally benign solvent for chemical reactions. When hydrogenations were conducted using polymer-supported colloidal Pd nanoparticles as catalysts in scCO2, we found turnover frequencies (TOFs) as high as 4000000h−1 even at a reasonably low hydrogen pressures of 15bar and temperatures of 50°C. To our surprise, their reactivity turned out to be much higher than those of most other catalysts reported in the literature. The kinetics of their catalytic reactions in supercritical fluids has been investigated using in situ NMR in combination with a toroid cavity autoclave (TCA).",
