For example, catalysts derived from K.2Fe(CO)4 supported on Alpa [5] and MHFe3(CO)n (M = K or Cs) on HY zeolite [7] which involve both alkali metals and an iron atom have been reported to be active for the synthesis of light olefins Although much attention has been focused on the promoting effect of alkali metal in F-T synthesis, there has been no systematic study on effects of an alkali metal on catalysts derived from supported metal carbonyl complexes This led us to investigate the effects of alkali metals on the catalytic activity and selectivity for preparation of light olefins using a novel catalyst system, [NEt3H]\"*\"[HFe3- (CO)ll]--MOH (M alkali metal )-zeohte, we now report the preliminary results obtained with such a system. Typical procedure for the preparation of the catalysts is as follows. [NEt3HnHFe3(CO)iir [8] (0 18 mmol, 0.10 g) and KOH (0.33 - 3.0 mol per mol Fe) in 5 ml of methanol were stirred at 25 C under an atmosphere of argon for 2 h This solution was added to a suspension of HY zeolite (0.30 g) in 1 ml of methanol, the mixture was stirred at 25 C for 3 h and then the solvent was removed in vacua (Fe/support = 10 wt.%) It was confirmed by an IR spectrum (v(C=0) 2071(w), 2006(vs), 1975(s), 1943(m), 1698(m) cm\"1) [9] that the structure of the tnnuclear anion species, HFe3- (C0)ii~, was kept at this stage** Each catalyst was activated in a flow of H; at 260 C for 2 h At the end of this procedure the organic compounds had been decomposed by hydrogenolysis and only a trace of methane was detected. The IR spectrum of the catalyst showed no v(C=0) absorption. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed **As the referees pointed out, HFe3(CO)n and the K-Fe,, species would not be located entirely in the cage of the zeolite Other supports such as alumina, silica gel and HZSM-5 showed other profiles of the activity, the results will be reported in a full paper 0304-6102/87/$3 50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 120 The F-T reaction was performed in a conventional pressurized fixed-bed flow reactor (6.0 mm i d X 100 mm, CO/H2 = 1, total pressure = 14 atm, Sy=2000h-1) Results on the [NEt3H]+[HFe3(CO)ll^-KOH-HY zeolite system are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1. The data were taken after 6 h on stream. Products were hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, and methanol (trace). In the reaction without potassium hydroxide at 320 C (Run 1), 6% of the charged carbon monoxide was converted into hydrocarbons (; e the effective con- version was 6%), and 25% (carbon-%) of the hydrocarbons formed was methane Contents of ethylene and propylene in the C; and 63 fractions were 18 and 42%, respectively As the K/Fe ratio was increased from 0 to 1 7, the catalytic activities markedly increased and the effective conversion reached a maximum of 32% at K/Fe =17 mol/mol (K/Fe = 0 24 by weight)* The activity and the distribution of the products were stable for more than 80 h. Further addition of KOH decreased the activity. The selectivity for olefms increased with an increase in the amounts of KOH When the K/Fe ratio was 3.0, ethylene and propylene, in the C; and fractions, reached 79 and 89%, respectively. With the addition of KOH the formation of methane was reduced, while that of long-chain hydrocarbons increased. At a K/Fe ratio of 2 3, distributions of methane and C-,+ were 17 and 22%, respectively. 10 20 30 M/Fe( mol/mol) M = K-HY( ), K-NaY(o) Fig 1 Effect of the amounts of KOH on the effective conversion [NEt3H]\"''[HFe3- (CO)ii]--MOH-HY or NaY zeolite 320 C, 14 atm, CO/H; = 1 0, Fe 10 wt % *CsOH, NaOH and LiOH also showed promoting effects The maxima of the effec- tive conversions were found at M/Fe ratios of 2 3 for Cs (effective conv 29%) and 3 0 for Na (effective conv 25%) respectively With LiOH, no peak in activity was observed Details of the results will be described in a full paper 1. ^ti -^ 01 r co in t^ 0) 0 u -I <N i-l i-( g)L| i -0 5 u Tf in to t- oo 01 oo a> ss */1 00 00 0 i-l 0 0 T-I s U 1-1 1-1 1-1 1-1 1-1 -c ^ (U s 0. 10 ^3 (0 10 irt l^ CD ftp J t-1 r-1 l-l l-l l-l r-< l-l c & ' ^ 1 c u v (N ^' C~ 'r (0 01 CT be a 'r oo to t~ oo oo t S 2-4-1 m i-l TO IN T-I 00 01 0 d 3 ^ IM IM 0) (N i-l i-l <N la .0 C s g CO M (3 c 00 i-l (N t 0 01 W 0 r-< i-l N <N 10 t- <N ^ 0 -0 .a ^ a r*u CO 0 CT i-l >-1 CO T-IM CO T-1 1 1 I 1 T-I T-1 ^3 g v 6 ^ 'S ^ o >>a u ira 10 CT i-l r- o ootN IN CO CO T-I (N T-I ? \"; s S| a T3 \"DLJ y ^ .

In general, the effect of alkali metals in the F-T reaction is explained by the ability of electron donation from the alkali metal to iron [2], however, the present results would not be completely explained by this effect Although characterization of the catalyst has not yet been performed, the ratio of K/Fe corresponding to the peak of catalytic activity would be due to the formation of KHFe3(CO)n on KY zeohte, the hydrogenolysis of which would afford an active and stable species having K-Fe,, units on the regulated surface of the zeolite* References 1 R B Anderson, B Sehgman,J F Shultz, R KellyandM A Elhott, Ind.
