Graphical abstract Triphenylphosphane substituted derivatives Co2(CO)6(CHCO2Et)(PPh3) (3) and Co2(CO)5(CHCO2Et)(PPh3)2 (4) were prepared from the known Co2(CO)7(CHCO2Et) and Co2(CO)6(CHCO2Et)2 complexes and were tested along with other phosphane-substituted cobalt carbonyl complexes as catalyst precursors in the carbonylation reaction of ethyl diazoacetate into diethyl malonate in the presence of ethanol. Keywords Carbene carbon monoxide coupling Triphenylphosphane substituted ethoxycarbonylcarbene-bridged dicobalt carbonyl complexes Diethyl malonate 1 Introduction Octacarbonyl dicobalt proved to be an excellent catalyst for the carbonylation of ethyl diazoacetate in the presence of an alcohol (methanol, ethanol, tert-butanol), phenol, or diethylamine to the corresponding malonic acid derivatives. Ethoxycarbonylcarbene-bridged dicobalt complexes Co2(CO)7(CHCO2Et) (1) and Co2(CO)6(CHCO2Et)2 (2) were found to be intermediates in those catalytic reactions [1]. We now report the reactions of these complexes with triphenylphosphane and the activity of the new PPh3-substituted derivatives in the carbonylation of ethyl diazoacetate to diethyl malonate. 2 Results and discussion In accord with Eq. (1) the addition of triphenylphosphane to solutions of Co2(CO)7(CHCO2Et) (1) obtained by the reaction of equimolar Co2(CO)8 and ethyl diazoacetate in n-pentane at room temperature gave, along with gas evolution, a cherry-red colored solution of Co2(CO)6(CHCO2Et)(PPh3) (3). Purple crystals of 3 were isolated in 38% yield after crystallization from n-pentane at −40°C, which were suitable for a single crystal X-ray structure determination. (1) C o 2 ( CO ) 7 ( CHC O 2 Et ) 1 +PP h 3 → C o 2 ( CO ) 6 ( CHC O 2 Et ) ( PP h 3 ) 3 +CO Preliminary results of the crystal structure determination of 3 [2] revealed that the ethoxycarbonylcarbene ligand is in bridging position between the two cobalt atoms. The phosphorus atom is trans to the carbene carbon atom. The phosphorus–cobalt–carbene carbon angle is 174.9(5)°. The CoCo bond length (2.485(4)Å) is a little longer than that found (2.447(1)Å) in a phosphane-substituted carbene-bridged dicobalt carbonyl complex, Co2(CO)5(PPhMe2)(PhCNPh)2 [3]. On the other hand, N-heterocyclic carbene dicobalt carbonyl complexes exhibit much longer CoCo bond lengths in the range of 2.6819(5)–2.6973(19)Å [4,5]. The Co-carbene carbon bond lengths in 3 (1.97(2) and 2.01(2)Å) are similar to those of other dicobalt carbonyl complexes with a bridging carbene ligand [3,6]. The infrared spectra of complex 3 in CH2Cl2 solution and in the solid state, as well show beside terminal ν(CO) bands at 2080, 2033, 2013, and 2075, 2027, 2017, 2005, 1990, a strong bridging carbonyl band at 1829 and 1825cm−1, respectively. For the intensities of these bands (see Table 1 ). Addition of triphenylphosphane to solutions of 3 caused the evolution of carbon monoxide and the formation of a new substituted derivative 4 according to reaction (2). The solubility of complex 4 in saturated hydrocarbons is very poor. Performing reaction (2) in n-pentane, complex 4 precipitates quantitatively from the solution. During attempted crystallization from CH2Cl2 solutions decomposition was observed. (2) C o 2 ( CO ) 6 ( CHC O 2 Et ) 3 ( PP h 3 ) + PP h 3 → C o 2 ( CO ) 5 ( CHC O 2 Et ) ( PP h 3 ) 2 4 + CO Substitution of a carbonyl ligand in 1 or 3 by triphenylphosphane results in the expected shift of the different carbonyl bands to lower wave numbers (see Table 1). Both of the triphenylphosphane-containing complexes 3 and 4 have one of the carbonyl ligands in a bridging position, as can be deduced from the single ν(CO) band in that region of the infrared spectra. The bridge ν(CO) in known phosphane-substituted carbene complexes such as in Co2(CO)5(C4O2H n Pr)[P(OPh)3] or Co2(CO)5(C4O2H n Pr)(P( n Bu3) (where C4O2H n Pr=3-n-propyl-2-butene-4-olide-4-ylidene) [7] and (Ph3P)(CO)2Co(CFCF3)(CO)Co(CO)2(PPh3) or ( n Bu3P)(CO)2Co(CFCF3)(CO)Co(CO)2(P n Bu3) [8] and Co2(CO)6(C4O2HPh)(P n Bu3)2 (where C4O2HPh=3-phenyl-2-butene-4-olide-4-ylidene) or Co2(CO)6(C4O2H n Pr)(PPh2 iPentyl)2 [9] was found at a similar wave number, respectively. The ethoxycarbonylcarbene ligand in 3 and 4 is also in a bridging position, according to the solid state structure of 3, and according to the characteristic appearance [10] of δCH in the 1H NMR and δ CH in the 13C NMR solution spectra of 3 and 4. The 31P NMR spectrum of complex 4 in solution at ambient temperature or in the solid state [11] show the presence of only one kind of phosphorus. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that to each of the cobalt atoms one triphenylphosphane is coordinated symmetrically in trans position to the carbene bridge. Experiments to obtain mono- or bis-triphenylphosphane derivative(s) of complex 2 failed. Adding PPh3 to solutions of 2 at room temperature or at 0°C resulted always in the formation of complex 4. Experiments using one mol PPh3 for one mol of 2 led to the formation of half mol of 4, and a half mol of 2 remained unchanged. By using a gas burette in performing the reaction of 2 with PPh3 at 10°C, no gas evolution could be observed. The infrared spectra of complex 4 in CH2Cl2 solution and in the solid state as well show four terminal ν(CO) bands at 2040, 2005, 1983, 1970, and 2034, 2003, 1980, 1964, and a strong bridging carbonyl band at 1786 and 1790cm−1, respectively. For the intensities of these bands see Table 1. The starting complex 2 does not contain bridging carbonyl groups. The two bridging positions in 2 are occupied by two ethoxycarbonylcarbene ligands [1]. Apparently, the addition of PPh3 to complex 2 expels one of the ethoxycarbonylcarbene and one of the CO ligands. This reaction is not accompanied by gas evolution, and a coupling of carbon monoxide to ethoxycarbonylketene can be expected. The infrared and NMR spectra of the reaction mixture, however, do not reveal the presence of either free [12] or coordinated ethoxycarbonylketene [13]. (3) C o 2 ( CO ) 6 ( CHC O 2 Et ) 2 + 2 2PP h 3 → C o 2 ( CO ) 5 ( CHC O 2 Et ) ( PP h 3 ) 2 4 + ( Et O 2 CCH C O ) Performing reaction (3) in the presence of ethanol, the putative ethoxycarbonylketene could be trapped quantitatively in form of diethyl malonate (checked by quantitative IR spectroscopy and gas-chromatography), without affecting the formation of complex 4 (reaction (4)). (4) 2 + 2 PP h 3 + EtOH → 4 + Et O 2 CC H 2 C O 2 Et Under CO pressure the ethoxycarbonylcarbene ligand in complex 3 could be displaced by carbon monoxide and the quantitative formation of the known Co2(CO)7(PPh3) complex could be inferred from the exclusive appearance of the characteristic ν(CO) bands at 2079 (4.4), 2026 (4.8), 2010 (sh), 1996 (10), and 1964 (3.0) cm−1 [14] in the infrared spectrum of the reaction product in n-hexane solution. In the presence of ethanol the formation of diethyl malonate in 66% yield could be deduced from the infrared spectrum of the reaction product using the known molar absorbance of diethyl malonate at 1747cm−1 in n-hexane [1] (5) 3 + 2 CO + EtOH ⟶ 24 h 25 ° C , 50 bar C o 2 ( CO ) 7 ( PP h 3 ) + Et O 2 CC H 2 C O 2 Et Attempts to regenerate complex 3 in n-heptane solution by the reaction of Co2(CO)7(PPh3) with ethyl diazoacetate under argon at 10°C failed. The formation of 3 could not be detected in the infrared spectrum of the reaction mixture. However, using the initial concentrations of [Co2(CO)7(PPh3)]0 =0.02mmol/cm3 and [EtO2CCHN2]0 =0.02mmol/cm3, a complete decomposition of ethyl diazoacetate into N2 and 1,2,3-triethoxycarbonylcyclopropane was observed in 5h with an initial rate of gas evolution of 1.8×10−6 mmol/(cm3 s). Complex 3 proved to be a good catalyst precursor in the selective catalytic carbonylation of ethyl diazoacetate to diethyl malonate (Eq. (6)). (6) Et O 2 CCH N 2 + CO + EtOH ⟶ 45 ° C , 50 bar , 24 h 2 mol % 3 N 2 + Et O 2 CC H 2 C O 2 Et 100 % Because complex 3 under 50 bar CO pressure, even at room temperature, is converted into Co2(CO)7(PPh3) (Eq. (5)), and the presence of this complex could be recognized in the infrared spectra of the reaction product using 3 as a catalyst, the catalytic activity of Co2(CO)7(PPh3) has been checked independently. According to Eq. (7) a complete conversion of ethyl diazoacetate and a 92.8% yield of diethyl malonate was found and 97% of the starting Co2(CO)7(PPh3) was recovered at the end of the reaction. (7) Et O 2 CCH N 2 + CO + EtOH ⟶ 45 ° C , 50 bar , 24 h 2 mol % C o 2 ( CO ) 7 ( PP h 3 ) N 2 + Et O 2 CC H 2 C O 2 Et 92.8 % Under CO pressure the ethoxycarbonylcarbene ligand in complex 4 could be displaced by carbon monoxide and the quantitative formation of the known [Co(CO)3(PPh3)2][Co(CO)4] complex could be inferred from the appearance of the characteristic ν(CO) bands at 2010 and 1889cm−1 [15] in the infrared spectrum of the reaction product in CH2Cl2 solution. In the presence of ethanol the formation of diethyl malonate in 66% yield could be deduced from the infrared spectrum of the reaction product (Eq. (8)) using the known molar absorbance of diethyl malonate at 1747cm−1 in n-hexane [1]. (8) 4 + 3 CO + EtOH ⟶ 24 h 25 ° C , 50 bar [ Co ( CO ) 3 ( PP h 3 ) 2 ] [ Co ( CO ) 4 ] + Et O 2 CC H 2 C O 2 Et Complex 4 proved to be suitable as a catalyst precursor in the catalytic carbonylation of ethyl diazoacetate to diethyl malonate in CH2Cl2 solution (Eq. (9)). The infrared spectrum of the product revealed beside the very strong bands of diethyl malonate at 1749 and 1732cm−1, bands of [Co(CO)3(PPh3)2][Co(CO)4] at 2110 and 1889cm−1, and traces of Co2(CO)6(PPh3)2 at 1957cm−1. (9) Et O 2 CCH N 2 + CO + EtOH ⟶ 45 ° C , 50 bar , 24 h 2 mol % 4 N 2 + Et O 2 CC H 2 C O 2 Et 98 % It is well known that the complex [Co(CO)3(PPh3)2][Co(CO)4] is converted, with loss of CO, above room temperature into Co2(CO)6(PPh3)2 [15–17]. We found that Co2(CO)6(PPh3)2, despite of its low solubility in organic solvents, is also suitable as a catalyst in the carbonylation of ethyl diazoacetate; however, a much longer reaction time is necessary for a complete conversion (Eq. (10)). (10) Et O 2 CCH N 2 + CO + EtOH ⟶ 45 ° C , 50 bar , 150 h 2 mol % C o 2 ( CO ) 6 ( PP h 3 ) 2 N 2 + Et O 2 CC H 2 C O 2 Et 100 % Repeating the above reaction under identical conditions but using [Co(CO)3(PPh3)2][Co(CO)4] as the catalyst precursor gave the same total conversion of ethyl diazoacetate to diethyl malonate. The red–brown color of the reaction product and a very weak band at 1957cm−1 in the infrared spectrum of the solution indicate that the cobalt complex Co2(CO)6(PPh3)2 is present at the end of the reaction. The same high selectivity but a little higher activity was found in the carbonylation of ethyl diazoacetate when Co2(CO)6(dppm) [18,19] (dppm=Ph2PCH2PPh2) was used as the catalyst. A possible mechanism of the catalytic formation of diethyl malonate from ethyl diazoacetate, CO, and ethanol is a cobalt-mediated diazo decomposition and a consecutive cobalt-mediated ethoxycarbonylcarbene/carbon monoxide coupling reaction leading to ethoxycarbonylketene, which is trapped by ethanol. The cobalt species involved in this catalysis might be 3 and 4 because their reaction with CO and ethanol produces diethyl malonate (Eqs. (5) and (8)). The catalytic cycle can be closed by regeneration of 3 and 4 from Co2(CO)7(PPh3) and [Co(CO)3(PPh3)2][Co(CO)4] or Co2(CO)6(PPh3)2 by the reaction with ethyl diazoacetate. Experimental evidence for both steps of such a mechanism has been described in the literature in the case of Co2(CO)6(dppm). First, the reaction of Co2(CO)6(dppm) with ethyl diazoacetate gives the carbene complex Co2(CO)5(CHCO2Et)(dppm), along with CO and N2 [20]. Second, the reaction of Co2(CO)5(CHCO2Et)(dppm) with CO and CD3OD give EtO2CCHCO, EtO2CCHDCO2CD3 and Co2(CO)6(dppm) [21], through the assumed intermediate. 3 Experimental 3.1 General comments Handling of Co2(CO)8 and other carbonyl cobalt complexes was carried out in an atmosphere of dry (P4O10) and deoxygenated (BTS contact, room temp.) argon or carbon monoxide utilizing standard Schlenk techniques [22]. Solvents were dried and distilled under an atmosphere of argon or carbon monoxide according to standard procedures [23]. IR spectra were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet Avatar 330 FTIR spectrometer using 0.00265, 0.00765, or 0.02153cm CaF2 solution cells, calibrated by the interference method [24]. Gas chromatographic analyses were performed on a HP 5890 instrument with FID, using a SPB 1 30m, 0.32μm column and n-nonane was used as an internal standard. 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 300 spectrometer at 300, 75.4, and 121.4MHz, respectively using CDCl3 as the solvent. Chemical shifts δ are reported in ppm, for 1H and 13C relative to CHCl3 (7.26 and 77.00ppm, respectively) and for 31P relative to H3PO4. Octacarbonyl dicobalt was prepared by a literature procedure [25], and was recrystallized twice in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide, first from CH2Cl2 and then from n-heptane. All other reagents and solvents were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich. The gas volume change in reactions at atmospheric pressure was determined using a thermostatted glass reactor having an inner volume of 55cm3, which was connected to a thermostatted mercury-filled gas burette. The reactions were started by injecting the reactant into the reactor as a stock solution, using a Hamilton TLL syringe, through a silicon disk port. Reactions under 50 bar CO pressure were performed in a stainless-steel autoclave with a glass liner (total capacity=12.8cm3) [26]. Microanalyses were performed using a CHNSO EA1108-Elemental Analyser (Carlo Erba). Cobalt and phosphorus analyses were performed using established micro analytical methods. 3.2 Preparation of Co2(CO)6(CHCO2Et)(PPh3), [μ2-{ethoxycarbonyl(methylene)}-μ2-(carbonyl)-(tricarbonyl-cobalt)-(triphenylphosphane-dicarbonyl-cobalt) (CoCo)] (3) A solution of Co2(CO)8 (2.61g, 7.63mmol) and ethyl diazoacetate (0.8cm3, 7.62mmol) in n-pentane (200cm3) was stirred in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide at room temperature for 1h. Addition of triphenylphosphane (2.63g, 10mmol) and stirring the mixture for 10min resulted in gas evolution and the formation of a cherry-red solution with a flaky precipitate. Filtration under argon and crystallization at −40°C gave 3 as 0.1–0.4mm size purple-red crystals (1.84g, 38%).

Addition of triphenylphosphane (1.38g, 5.26mmol) and stirring the mixture for 15min resulted in the formation of a light yellow solution and a brick-red precipitate. Filtration under argon gave 4 as a red powder (1.48g, 99%). 3.3.2 Method B Addition of triphenylphosphane (2.0g, 7.63mmol) under argon to a stirred, filtered solution obtained from Co2(CO)8 (2.61g, 7.63mmol), ethyl diazoacetate (0.8cm3, 7.62mmol) and triphenylphosphane (2.63g, 10mmol) in n-pentane (200cm3) as described above in the preparation of 3, gave, within 10min, a pale yellow solution and a brick-red precipitate.

Within a minute a powdery orange–red solid began to precipitate, and the color of the solution became light yellow. In one hour reaction time no change in gas volume occurred, and the reaction mixture became almost colorless. The infrared spectrum in the 2200–1600cm−1 range showed two strong ν(CO) absorptions of diethyl malonate at 1762 and 1747cm−1. From their intensities using the molar absorbance in n-hexane solvent ɛ M =699cm2/mmol and ɛ M =843cm2/mmol, respectively, a diethyl malonate concentration of 0.019mmol/cm3 could be calculated, which corresponds to a 95% yield. Isolation of the precipitate by filtration gave 77mg of 4 as a dark orange–red powder, which corresponds to a 89% yield. 3.5 Reaction of [μ2-{ethoxycarbonyl(methylene)}-μ2-(carbonyl)-(tricarbonyl-cobalt)-(tri-phenylphosphane-dicarbonyl-cobalt) (Co-Co)] (3) with CO in the presence of ethanol A solution of complex 3 (51.7mg, 0.0815mmol) and anhydrous ethanol (0.030cm3, 0.51mmol) in 1.2cm3 of CH2Cl2 was pressurized with CO in an autoclave and was shaken at 25°C for 24h. The CH2Cl2 was removed from the brown colored product in vacuum, and the residue was dissolved in 4.0cm3 of n-hexane. The infrared spectrum in the 2200–1600cm−1 range showed the characteristic ν(CO) bands of Co2(CO)7(PPh3) and diethyl malonate. Comparison of the spectrum with that of known concentrations of authentic samples of Co2(CO)7(PPh3) revealed the presence of 0.079mmol of this complex in the reaction product, corresponding to a 97% yield. The concentration of diethyl malonate was calculated by using the known molar absorbance, which gave a 66% yield. 3.6 Reaction of ethyl diazoacetate with CO and ethanol in the presence of 2mol% of 3 A solution of complex 3 (33.0mg, 0.0520mmol), ethyl diazoacetate (0.274cm3, 2.60mmol), and anhydrous ethanol (0.22cm3, 3.75mmol) in CH2Cl2 (5.0cm3) was pressurized with carbon monoxide (50bar) at room temperature and shaken for 24h at 45°C. The infrared spectrum of the reaction mixture in the range of 2200–1600cm−1 showed no bands of unchanged ethyl diazoacetate (ɛ M(CH2Cl2, 2112cm−1)=800cm2/mmol, and ɛ M(CH2Cl2, 1692cm−1)=605cm2/mmol) to be present, but strong ν(CO) bands of diethyl malonate at 1749 and 1732cm−1, corresponding to a concentration of 0.4747mmol/cm3 (100% yield), which was calculated using the molar absorbance of diethyl malonate ɛ M(CH2Cl2, 1749cm−1)=579cm2/mmol, and ɛ M(CH2Cl2, 1732cm−1)=666cm2/mmol. 3.7 Reaction of ethyl diazoacetate with CO and ethanol in the presence of 2mol% of Co2(CO)7(PPh3) A solution of Co2(CO)7(PPh3) [14] (37.2mg, 0.0645mmol), ethyl diazoacetate (0.340cm3, 3.233mmol), and anhydrous ethanol (0.284cm3, 4.84mmol) in CH2Cl2 (6.1cm3) was pressurized with carbon monoxide (50bar) at room temperature and shaken for 24h at 45°C. The infrared spectrum of the reaction mixture in the range of 2200–1600cm−1 showed no bands of unchanged ethyl diazoacetate at 2112 and 1692cm−1 to be present, but strong ν(CO) bands of diethyl malonate at 1749 and 1732cm−1, corresponding to a concentration of 0.445mmol/cm3, a 92.8% yield, which was calculated using the molar absorbance of diethyl malonate in CH2Cl2 (see above). The only other bands present were at 2078 (s), 2023 (s), 1988 (vs), and 1958 (m), characteristic of Co2(CO)7(PPh3). 3.8 Reaction of complex 4 with CO in the presence of ethanol A solution of complex 4 (43.4mg, 0.05mmol) and anhydrous ethanol (0.014cm3, 0.24mmol) in 1.0cm3 of CH2Cl2 was pressurized with CO (50bar) in an autoclave and was shaken at 25°C for 24h. The infrared spectrum of the light yellow colored product solution in the 2200–1600cm−1 range showed the characteristic strong ν(CO) bands of [Co(CO)3(PPh3)2][Co(CO)4] [5] at 2010 and 1889cm−1, and those of diethyl malonate at 1749 and 1732cm−1. By using the molar absorbance of [Co(CO)3(PPh3)2][Co(CO)4] ɛ M(CH2Cl2, 2010cm−1)=1704cm2/mmol; and ɛ M(CH2Cl2, 1989cm−1)=2280cm2/mmol and those of diethyl malonate in CH2Cl2 (see above) for the calculation of the concentrations showed that practically all of the cobalt from the starting complex to be present in the form of [Co(CO)3(PPh3)2][Co(CO)4], and the yield of diethyl malonate is 96%. 3.9 Reaction of ethyl diazoacetate with CO and ethanol in the presence of 2mol% of 4 A solution of complex 4 (40.5mg, 0.0466mmol), ethyl diazoacetate (0.245cm3, 2.33mmol), and anhydrous ethanol (0.20cm3, 3.41mmol) in CH2Cl2 (4.0cm3) was pressurized with carbon monoxide (50bar) at room temperature and shaken for 24h at 45°C. The infrared spectrum of the tea-colored reaction product in the range of 2200–1600cm−1 using a 0.00265cm CaF2 solution cell showed no bands of unchanged ethyl diazoacetate, but strong ν(CO) bands of diethyl malonate at 1749 and 1732cm−1, corresponding to a concentration of 0.522mmol/cm3, a 98% yield. An infrared spectrum of the product using a 0.02153cm CaF2 solution cell revealed bands of [Co(CO)3(PPh3)2][Co(CO)4] at 2110 and 1888cm−1, and traces of Co2(CO)6(PPh3)2 at 1957cm−1. 3.10 Reaction of ethyl diazoacetate with CO and ethanol in the presence of 2mol% of Co2(CO)6(PPh3)2 A mixture of Co2(CO)6(PPh3)2 [5] (25.7mg, 0.0317mmol), ethyl diazoacetate (0.166cm3, 1.58mmol), and anhydrous ethanol (0.140cm3, 2.38mmol) in CH2Cl2 (3.0cm3) was pressurized with carbon monoxide (50bar) at room temperature and shaken for 150h at 45°C. The infrared spectrum of the tea-colored reaction product in the range of 2200–1600cm−1 showed no bands of unchanged ethyl diazoacetate at 2112cm−1 and 1692cm−1, but strong ν(CO) bands of diethyl malonate at 1749 and 1732cm−1, corresponding to a concentration of 0.477mmol/cm3, a 100% yield). Repeating the above reaction under identical conditions but using [Co(CO)3(PPh3)2][Co(CO)4] (26.8mg, 0.032mmol) as the catalyst precursor gave the same total conversion of ethyl diazoacetate to diethyl malonate. 3.11 Reaction of ethyl diazoacetate with CO and ethanol in the presence of 2mol% of Co2(CO)6(dppm) A mixture of Co2(CO)6 (dppm) [18,19] (25.9mg, 0.0386mmol), ethyl diazoacetate (0.205cm3, 1.58mmol), and anhydrous ethanol (0.176cm3, 3.0mmol) in CH2Cl2 (4.0cm3) was pressurized with carbon monoxide (50bar) at room temperature and shaken for 96h at 45°C. The infrared spectrum of the light yellow–orange colored reaction product in the range of 2200–1600cm−1 showed no bands of unchanged ethyl diazoacetate at 2112cm−1 and 1692cm−1, but characteristic ν(CO) bands of Co2(CO)6(dppm) and diethyl malonate (IR Co2(CO)6(dppm) in CH2Cl2: ν(CO) 2045 (ɛ M =2808cm2/mmol), 2012 (ɛ M =3406cm2/mmol), 1985 (ɛ M =3751cm2/mmol), ν(CO) 1820 (ɛ M =823cm2/mmol), 1794 (ɛ M =1066cm2/mmol) cm−1). Using the molar absorbance in the quantitative analysis of the spectra [Co2(CO)6(dppm)]=0.0088mmol/cm3, and [diethyl malonate]=0.423mmol/cm3, were obtained corresponding to a 99% recovery of the starting Co2(CO)6(dppm) and a 95% yield of diethyl malonate at the end of the reaction.

The new complexes 3 and 4 as well as Co2(CO)7(PPh3), Co2(CO)6(PPh3)2, and Co2(CO)6 (dppm) (dppm=Ph2PCH2PPh2) were found to be suitable catalyst precursors in the selective carbonylation of ethyl diazoacetate to diethyl malonate in the presence of ethanol.",
