Box 77, Budapest, H-1525, Hungary (Received 18 October 1993; revised 11 February 1994; accepted 11 February 1994) Abstract Probe molecules can be used to complement surface characterisation techniques for elucidating the nature of possible active sites in supported metal catalysts. 2,24methylbutane (neohexane) is eminently suitable for this purpose because it combines an isobutyl and an ethyl group, representing two archetypes for hydrocarbon reactions on metal catalysts. In this review a survey is given of hydrogendeuterium exchange, hydrogenolysis, and isomerization of 2,2-dimethylbutane mainly on Group 810 metals, copper, and rhenium, as well as on their various alloys. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange results are presented, and interpretations in terms of factors such as different surface morphologies are considered. For 2,2-dimethylbutane, hydrogenolysis is the main reaction on most catalysts. Isomerization is restricted to platinum, palladium, and to some extent to iridium and nickel. The relative importance of isomerisation versus hydrogenolysis has been examined and it is shown that this is critically dependent on a number of factors, such as the dispersion of the metal, alloy formation, nonmetallic promoters, etc. The patterns of hydrogenolysis products can also be very informative because of the relationship between the observed product and the mode of adsorption of the 2,2-dimethylbutane molecule on different types of surface site. The use of 2,2-dimethylbutane to probe the surface composition of bimetallic particles has been discussed and the factors which influence the product distribution have been examined. The effect of non-metallic additives (water and chlorine) on the ratio of hydrogenolysis-to-isomerization is discussed and the possible important role of the metalsupport interface (`adlineation sites') is pointed out.

Metal-hydrocarbon interactions in catalysis; the importance of using probe molecules Since the introduction of the concept of the active site by H.S. Taylor [ 1 ], there have been many attempts to identify and describe active sites on catalyst surfaces. Various methods have been used to this end, including controlled modification of the catalyst surface (e.g., by alloying the active metal with a nominally inert additive [2] ) and/or by the use of different surface science (basically ultra high vacuum) techniques. The latter methods can only occasionally be used as in situ characterisation methods and, moreover, since the introduction of the reactants may very probably change the structure and properties of the catalyst surface [3,4], there is always a considerable doubt about the applicability of such methods to real catalysts. The need to develop genuine in situ techniques for characterising metal surfaces under normal operating conditions extends beyond the purely fundamental interest in active sites. For example, it would be very valuable if methods were available which could be used to monitor changes in the nature of metal catalysts during activation (calcination, reduction), regeneration, or redispersion, all of which are treatments used on real catalysts during their normal working lives. One possible approach to this problem is to use probe molecules, or probe reactions. In principle, reactant molecules provide the most sensitive and specific probe of the surface chemistry of an active site since in the course of their adsorption, reaction and desorption, they must have been associated with the active site. If we are able to interrogate these molecules after their sojourn on the catalyst we may be able to obtain almost direct information about the nature of the active catalyst surface, as far as its catalytic properties are concerned. The exact identification of the active sites as atoms or group of atoms in a certain chemical state and/or geometry still remains an open question. As part of an on-going research programme in the laboratories of both the authors [ 3,5 ] on the characterisation of metal catalysts for hydrocarbon reactions (reforming catalysts) we have begun to attempt to utilise probe reactions to monitor changes R. Burch, Z. Padl /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 9-33 11 in the surface chemistry of platinum and Pt/Re reforming catalysts during and after the oxychlorination treatment used industrially to revitalise these catalysts. As a result of this research it has become apparent that some of the existing views on the types of active site required for hydrocarbon reactions (skeletal rearrangements and hydrogenolysis) may be incomplete. The detailed experimental evidence to support this statement will be published elsewhere. However, in the present paper we address the more general question of the specific use of 2,2-dimethylbutane (neohexane) as a probe reactant of the surface chemistry of metallic catalysts. Metal catalyzed hydrocarbon reactions include dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, and isomerisation, and, provided the structure of the molecules permit it, cyclization to five-membered cyclopentane rings or to six-membered aromatic cycles is also possible [ 5 ] . The formation and opening of cyclopentane-type structures may represent one of the routes to skeletal isomers [6]. These represent a host of various reaction routes, all, with the exception of dehydrogenation, involving the rupture (and/or formation) of C-C bonds (so-called `skeletal reactions'). Ponec [ 2 ] classified the metal-hydrocarbon interactions to be (i) 2C (interaction of two neighbouring C atoms with the catalyst); (ii) 3C (interaction of the first and the last C atoms in a C3 chain fragment with the catalyst); and (iii) 5C (interaction of a five C-atom molecular fragment with the catalyst). It is obvious, that (iii) leads to so-called CS-cyclic reactions [6] whereas (i) can lead to hydrogenolysis and (ii) to either hydrogenolysis or to `bond-shift type' [7] (or `C3cyclic') [ 2 ] isomerisation. One may decide to select a model compound for which all variations are possible (e.g., n-hexane); however, if one intends to deliberately keep down the number of possible transformations, it is better to select a model hydrocarbon with limited reaction pathways. In this way, the possible role of different types of metal-hydrocarbon interaction can be assessed. Obviously, different types of metal-hydrocarbon interactions will be favoured by different reactant structures. Foger and Anderson proposed two basic modes of interaction between a hydrocarbon and a catalytically active metal surface: a `CZunit mode' and an `iso-unit mode' reaction. They called the simplest molecules whose structure only permitted one or the other type of reaction `archetypes' [ 8] . Neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane) represents the archetype for the iso-unit type reaction. 2. 2,2-Dimethylbutane as a probe molecule Since neopentane is a very symmetrical molecule in which only 3C-type interactions are possible, this molecule does not offer a high number of variations and does not, therefore, provide much information about different types of adsorption intermediate or about small variations in catalytic properties. 2,2-dimethylbutane (neohexane), which contains just one CHZ group more offers four types of metalhydrocarbon interactions including a,6 { type (i) } and two type (ii) interactions: a Y CH neo-hexane R.

The a(3 interaction represents a CZ-unit whereas the others lead to an iso-unit mode of reaction. These interactions, providing they involve only a single step, lead to various hydrogenolysis and isomerisation products as shown in Table 1 [ 9] . The fraction of products involving multiple transformations was, in most cases, rather low, hence the results shown characterise, indeed, reactions during one sojourn of the reactant on the surface. 2,2-Dimethylbutane represents a peculiar type of probe molecule. Although it lacks some of the finer subtleties of other molecules, like, methylcyclopentane, for example, where the ratio of ring opening products can reveal minor changes in catalyst structure, particle size, metal-support interactions or state of surface carbonization ( or carburization ) [ 10 ] , 2,2-dimethylbutane can be extremely sensitive to apparently small changes in the catalyst. It interacts either with its t-butyl or with R. Burch, Z. Padl /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 9-33 13 its ethyl group attached to the surface and the former interaction may either lead to hydrogenolysis or to isomerisation. In certain circumstances, the change in product selectivity, e.g., from hydrogenolysis to isomerisation, can be very drastic, and in some cases rather clear effects can be obtained when 2,2-dimethylbutane is used to probe metal catalyst surfaces. 2,2-Dimethylbutane represents a product of ring opening of 1,1,3-trimethylcyclopropane, this reaction probing the stereochemical aspects of catalysis [ 11 ] . 3. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange of 2,2-dimethylbutane over metals H-D exchange represents a reaction involving the breaking and formation of CH bonds only. Since all skeletal reactions are usually preceded by loss of one or more H atoms from the reacting alkane, the study of the exchange reaction may be useful to elucidate their initial and final steps. Single exchange means the breaking and re-formation of one C-H bond, whereas multiple exchange involves several such elementary actions during one sojourn of the molecule on the surface. The propagation of multiple exchange involves usually repeated a 1i interactions [ 12] and a quaternary C atom presents an effective blocking to all of the H atoms being exchanged. That is the reason why `multiple' exchange in 2,2-dimethylbutane usually means the incorporation of up to 5 D atoms in its ethyl group. The exchange over nickel film at 0 leads to 98% monodeuterated product together with 2% d2. A platinum film at 20 resulted in 67% dl and 16% d3 product, palladium at 85 gave 31 % d, and 57% d5 product [ 13 ] . The percentage of other deuterated products was small, the maximum number of deuterium atoms being 5 in one neohexane molecule. These authors also studied the deuterium content of deuterolysis of 1,1,3-trimethylcyclopentane. The deuterium distribution was shifted toward more d2-d5 between 116 and 200 over Pt-A1203 with 2 to 4% d6 product [ 14], the overall conversion being increased simultaneously from 4 to 18%. Table 2 shows that the H-D exchange over Pt/Si02, Pd/Si02 [15] as well as over Rh/Si02 [ 16] catalysts at 75 to 110 gave d, to d5 products of various distributions which showed no systematic changes as a function of dispersion (between 11 and 108%) or of the temperature of the hydrogen pretreatment (100 to 450) following a standard oxygen pretreatment at 300. Various metals gave very different exchange patterns. The extent of exchange was much higher in the ethyl group than in the tent-butyl group over rhodium, the ratio t-bu/et varying between 0.05 and 0.17. Catalysts with medium dispersion gave the highest values. At variance with the finding of Lebrilla and Maier [ 14 ] , Eskinazi and Burwell [ 15 ] reported more H-D exchange in the tent-butyl than in the ethyl group over platinum catalysts, the t-bu/et ratio being always higher than unity over platinum catalysts. This ratio was at intermediate values over palladium, this catalyst giving certainly the highest amount of multiply exchanged species in the dl-d5 range. 14 R. Burch, Z.

Treated at the temperature noted in hydrogen, cooled in hydrogen. Catalyst dispersion is shown in brackets. The various exchange patterns were interpreted in terms of different surface morphologies involving, most probably, sites comprising more than one metal atom. The possible interaction of surface hydrogen with OH groups of the silica support in the rhodium catalyst with exceedingly high activity (dispersion 108%, pretreated in hydrogen at 450) was not excluded [16]. With platinum and palladium catalysts a remarkable lack of correlation of the d5 species with dispersion was observed [ 15 ] . The two possible explanations proposed involved either `extractive chemisorption', or the absence of really flat surfaces even in catalysts with relatively low dispersion. This latter model has a vague resemblance to the suggested predominance of rounded high-Miller-index faces in various supported and unsupported catalysts in the stable sintered state [ 17 ] . 4. Skeletal reactions of 2,2-dimethylbutane Csicsery and Pines [ 18 ] studied the conversion of neohexane over an `acid-free' chromia-alumina catalyst. The main products at 14% conversion were ethane plus ethene, isobutene and 3,3-dimethylbutene-1 (with selectivities of 25, 21 and 22%, respectively). The total isomerisation selectivity was about 6%, including about 0.5% dimethylbutene and 5% 2-methylpentene. These authors have formulated the `C3 cyclic' skeletal isomerisation pathway prior to the postulation of the bond shift mechanism over metal catalysts, based, mainly on the presence of ca. 0.1% 1,1,2trimethylcyclopropane in the product. Earlier studies of reactions of alkane - including also 2,2-dimethylbutane over supported metal catalysts were discussed in terms of the bifunctional mechanism attributing skeletal isomerisation to acidic centres [ 19 ] . The acid catalyzed isomerisation of 2,2-dimethylbutane involves carbocations. Three different methods of kinetic analysis of bifunctional reactions of all five hexane isomers present R. Burch, Z. PadllApplied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 9-33 15 simultaneously in a mixture reacting over Pt/A1203 (435, 10.5 bar, HZ/hydrocarbon ratio 20) all gave the highest relative rate constant for the reaction of 2,2 dimethylbutane to 2,3-dimethylbutane (around 4 as compared with constants below unity for methylpentane formation or fragmentation) [20]. This is in agreement with the known fact that the stability of carbenium ions decreases from tertiary toward primary ones [ 19 ] , hence the formation of 2,3-dimethylbutane (involving reaction of a secondary to tertiary carbenium ion) should be favoured. Platinum catalysts supported on various zeolites showed rather high isomerisation selectivities (15 to 98% between 200 and 310) . The amount of isomers was proportional to the acidity of the support and was, therefore, attributed to a dual function effect, i.e., to the combined interaction of metallic and acidic sites [ 21 ] . This may be a satisfactory explanation when 2,3-dimethylbutane was the only isomer formed (over 3% Pt supported on various zeolites); however, mixtures of Pt/Si02 with various zeolites resulted in the formation of other hexane isomers also, including n-hexane which must have involved a metal-catalyzed route [ 21 ] . Recent work in one of our laboratories [22] indicates that other factors, and hence alternative mechanisms, may be important. Thus, as we shall discuss later, apparently small differences in the pretreatment of even alumina-supported platinum catalysts can result in large variations in the selectivity for isomerisation (e.g., from 9 to 72%, see later, Table 9) . It now seems possible that the variation in the acidity may not be directly responsible for the enhanced isomerisation selectivity. An alternative possibility which may cause the observed changes in selectivity can be the presence of some incompletely reduced platinum in the cages of the zeolitic support. The presence of electron-deficient platinum species as shown by the ESCA spectrum of Pt-zeolites [ 21 ] seems to confirm this point. The actual ratio for various types of interaction (according to Table 1) has been calculated from product distributions over Pt, Pd, Ir and Ni catalysts (Table 3). The major skeletal reaction of neohexane over metals is hydrogenolysis. The isomerisation selectivity decreased roughly in the order Pt = Pd Ir > Ni and so did the importance of 1,3 (ay' plus ay) interactions as compared with a/3 interactions, i.e., lower isomerisation selectivities were usually concomitant with enhanced formation of neopentane (see also later). Isomerisation of 2,2-dimethylbutane seems to be restricted to platinum and palladium, and sometimes iridium and nickel. Its extent depends on the conditions and also the properties of the actual catalyst samples (see also later, Sections 6 and 8). Neohexane is also able to undergo aromatization. This reaction requires hydrogen-deficient conditions, hence the yields reported when pulses were introduced into helium carrier gas were higher than with hydrogen carrier gas. A benzene selectivity of 43% was reported at 390 over Pd black while this value was as low as 7% over Pt black at 420 (both in helium). These values dropped to 4% and 0.5 %, respectively in hydrogen carrier gas [ 25 ] . Aromatization must involve a two-step bond shift isomerization without desorption of any intermediates. This process seems to be more facilitated over palladium than over platinum, as indicated 16 R.

The Ea value over palladium was almost the same as observed for n-hexane and 3-methylpentane, pointing to a common rate determining step (which could not be the rearrangement of the carbon skeleton). In contrast, aromatization of n-hexane required a much lower Ea value on platinum (44 kJ mol'), indicating the skeletal rearrangement step (s) to be rate determining over this catalyst. Small amounts of benzene and methylcyclopentane (up to 2% selectivity) have also been reported over Ir/Si02 [26]. Under hydrogen-deficient conditions favouring benzene formation, a dehydrogenation to 3,3-dimethylbutene-1 was also observed. This is apparently another possible product of an ap interaction with insufficient hydrogen present. The amount increased when pulses were introduced in helium onto a Pt black catalyst without regeneration, with a simultaneous abrupt decrease of hydrogenolysis, while the benzene yield showed a maximum (Fig. 1) [ 23 ] . The yield of 3,3-dimethylbutene-1 was much lower than that of alkenes from 3-methylpentane or 2,3-dimethylbutane over Pd black at 390, being around 0.4% in helium, and this value decreased slowly to ca. 0.2% when the hydrogen content of the gas reached 100% [25].

Adapted from ref. [23]. 5. Hydrogenolysis patterns of 2,2-dimethylbutane Splitting of C-C bonds in various positions can be conveniently characterised by the reactivity factor, c) defined by Leclercq et al. [28] as being in any position actual rate of rupture co expected rate of rupture (random fission) The major skeletal reaction of neohexane over metals is hydrogenolysis. Three types of single C-C bond splitting may occur in 2,2-dimethylbutane, giving isobutane (plus ethane), isopentane (plus methane) and neopentane (plus methane) as the primary fragments (cf. Table 1 and Scheme 1) . Summing up the amounts of the larger fragments (isoC4, isoC5 and neoC5), dividing this sum by 3 and relating this value to the actual amount of fragments would give an approximate value of w in the corresponding positions. The statistical weight of the primary-toquaternary C-C bond is 3:1, i.e., the amount of isopentane produced by this sort of splitting should be divided by 3. The individual values of cu can vary from zero to 3 and their sum must be equal to 3. This procedure leaves products of multiple CC bond splitting (resulting in e.g., propane or n-butane) out of consideration and gives, therefore, numerical values different from previous calculations considering all fragments [ 28-30 ] . Selected co values are shown in Table 4. Assigning the fragments to various hydrocarbon-metal interactions has been done with the assumption that an a-/ interaction leading to isopentane is negligible as compared with formation of isobutane, as suggested by Botman et al. [ 37 ] . This procedure may slightly overestimate the ay interaction and, conversely, underestimate the ay' one; however, as 18 R. Burch, Z.

[ 37 ] , `this possible error does not invalidate any of the conclusions made.' The catalysts in Table 4 show a great variation as far as the preferred direction of the reaction is concerned. Platinum produces mostly the isobutane fragment (ay' interaction). Somewhat surprisingly, this is the main fragment over Mo/A1203 catalysts reduced to zerovalent molybdenum [ 38 ] . Palladium is the only metal where isopentane (ay interaction) is the preferred product. Iridium shows the largest uncertainties, depending on the method of preparation, support, and probably also on the particle size, caused, in part, also by multiple reactions. Neopentane ( a (3 interaction) is the most abundant primary product over most rhodium catalysts shown here and also over Ru/A1203, nickel or cobalt supported on silicon carbide [ 39 ] . Nickel caused demethylation of the ethyl group with a suppressed splitting of the quaternary-primary C-C bond [40]. Another study (where the calculation of rv considered also the fragments of multiple splitting) gave numerically different values but showed also a preference for the formation of isobutane on platinum, of isopentane on palladium and of neopentane over iridium and rhodium [29], in qualitative agreement with Table 4. Another splitting parameter, Mf considers the multiplicity of fragmentation by relating the amount of fragments containing more than 1 carbon atom to that of R. Burch, Z Padl /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 9-33 19 methane [ 41 ] . If this ratio is higher than one, internal or random fission occurs, an Mf=1 indicates terminal demethylation, while Mf < 1 is observed with true multiple splitting. The values of Mf increased with increasing temperature over Ir/Si02 samples (from about Mf= 2 to M f = 7) [ 26 ] . This was taken as an evidence for the increasing role of 1,3-interactions at higher temperatures. The temperature depend ence of a modified fission parameter (Mf) excluding the amounts of isobutane plus ethane (ay' interaction) was much less pronounced. The multiplicity of fragmentation, ~ (i.e., the number of fragment molecules per molecule of neohexane split up [42]) was just above 2 over Rh/A1203 [ 30] as well as on Ru/A1203 [ 35], indicating that single rupture was the main reaction over this catalyst in spite of its high hydrogenolysis selectivity. 6. Probing catalyst compositions with 2,2-dimethylbutane Adding catalytically inactive alloying metals such as silver or gold to platinum increased the isomerisation selectivity to 94-98% as opposed to 28-52% over unalloyed platinum ( [ 9 ] , cf. also Table 3) . At the same time, the a (3 type interaction was suppressed. Less marked enhancement of isomerisation was seen with Pd-Ag. The possible importance of this finding will be discussed in Section 8. The overall activity of Pt/Si02 decreased by a factor of ca. 10 from 100% Pt to 60%Pt-40%Cu [ 37 ] ; a further increase of copper content had a considerably smaller effect. As opposed to the other additives mentioned, hydrogenolysis selectivity increased above 40% Cu content without a corresponding increase of the a/3 interaction (Table 5) . This was interpreted by assuming that Pt-Cu ensembles possessed an intrinsic catalytic activity in hydrogenolysis.

Burch, Z Padl /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 9-33 The activity of Pt-Re/A1203 catalysts was higher than that of pure platinum, especially above 40% Re. In contrast with Table 3 [ 9 ] , the isomerisation selectivity reported for high dispersion Re-free Pt/A1203 was around 10-20% (see later, Table 7) and this remained so up to 50% Re content and it disappeared entirely at 60% or more rhenium [ 44 ] . A heavy carbonization of Pt-Re/A1203 catalysts decreased the activities by factors between 15 and 50. At the same time, the isomerisation selectivity was about 95% up to 40% Re, decreasing only to 40% with 60% Re content in the alloy. Most isomers were formed via ay' interaction, the extent of which decreased parallel to that of the isomerisation selectivity. The selectivity of products of multiple fragmentation also increased to about 20% at higher rhenium content. This was reflected also by the variation of Mf values [ 44 ] . Results with EUROPT-4 (0.3% Pt 0.3% Re on y-A1203, i.e., 50% Re content) indicate isomerisation selectivities up to 45% [ 45 ] , but even with this high value, neopentane formation was markedly higher than that observed with monometallic Pt/A1203 catalysts. The activity of a 90%Rh-10%Cu/Si02 catalyst was lower by a factor of 25 than that of pure Rh/Si02 [33]. No isomerisation was reported. Adding copper shifted the fragmentation pattern slightly towards isobutane formation (at 218, co= 0.17 ) with somewhat less isopentane fragment (w= 0.1) and left almost unchanged, still predominant, neopentane formation (c) = 2.7; cf. these with the corresponding values for rhodium catalysts in Table 4) . Coq et al. [ 34 ] observed more isopentane than isobutane in the range of 100% Rh to 25%Rh-75%Cu on A1203-supported catalysts, its amount increasing somewhat when more copper was present. Neopentane formation predominated with all catalyst compositions. Addition of inactive alloying components increased, in general, isomerisation ability of the catalysts studied. Copper and rhenium, however, enhanced hydrogenolysis, the fragmentation pattern remaining essentially unchanged with copper but shifting towards neopentane formation and multiple hydrogenolysis with rhenium, which is a rather active multiple splitting catalyst in its own right [ 42 ] . A peculiar additive, VOCI, has been claimed to exert a geometric influence by decreasing the possibility of multi-site reactions, including the multiple fission over rhodium. The decrease of the isomerisation selectivity on Pt/VOCl was attributed to the possibility of single-site hydrogenolysis [ 46 ] . Its effect was comparable with that of copper additive. 7. Comparison of 2,2-dimethylbutane with other probe molecules Table 5 demonstrates that essentially the same selectivity pattern was observed with n-hexane and 2,2-dimethylbutane as a function of the composition of Pt-Cu alloys [ 37,43 ] , with slightly higher actual values for hydrogenolysis of 2,2-dimethylbutane, indicating that this reaction may be favoured by the structure containing R.

(b) Initial rate of rupture of the C,-C,v bonds (same reagents as Fig. 2a) [46]. a quaternary C-atom. The cumulative selectivity for nondestructive reactions from n-hexane is higher than from 2,2-dimethylbutane, although that of isomerisation proper is lower, since the common C5 cyclic surface intermediate responsible for most of the isomerisation of n-hexane can form both isomers and methylcyclopentane [5,6]. The reactions of various hydrocarbons containing quaternary C atoms have been compared over Pt black [ 47 ] . The overall reaction rates for all hydrocarbons had pronounced maxima as a function of hydrogen pressure at 330 and 10 Torr hydrocarbon pressure at p ( H2 ) 60-120 Torr. Hydrogenolysis was the predominant reaction. The rates measured at the maximum were as shown in Figs. 2a and b. One can see that the reactivity of the C-C bond splitting between the quaternary C atom and its most substituted neighbour increased considerably with increasing substitution of the latter, while the rate of demethylation generally showed an opposite trend. Clarke et al. [ 31,48 ] , in contrast, reported more trimethylbutane than isobutane from 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane, over Pt/Ti02reduced at both 300 and 400. The product pattern from 2,2-dimethylbutane was also different over these catalysts. 22 R. Burch, Z.

The amount of trimethylbutane fragment increased from 1.4 to 27% on decreasing the metal particle size from 15 to 1.2 nm with Rh /A1203 [ 30 ] . The isomerisation selectivity of 2,2-dimethylbutane was much lower over 10%lr/Si02 than that of pentane isomers at a HZ/hydrocarbon ratio of 2, Si being 5.1, 1.2 and 0.03% for n-pentane, 2-methylbutane and 2,2-dimethylbutane, respectively [ 32 ] . The turnover frequencies (given as 10' molecules s-' g(Pt) -') for 2,2-dimethylpropane (neopentane), 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane were 8.7, 19 and 15.2, respectively over a Pt/Ti02 catalyst at 300, being somewhat at variance with the sequence seen in Fig. 2, owing, maybe, to the much higher hydrogen excess used by Clarke et al. [ 31 ] . Various reactants gave rather different turnover frequencies (TOF) over Rh/ A1203, 2,2-dimethylbutane being among the less reactive hydrocarbons. The reactivity of various molecules over a 25%Rh-75%Cu catalysts did not decrease uniformly, 2,2-dimethylbutane showing the lowest extent of deactivation although even this represents a factor of nearly 100 (Table 6) [ 34 ] . The change of activity upon alloying rhodium with copper was less marked with 2,2-dimethylbutane than with methylcyclopentane (Table 6) . In addition, the selectivities also underwent more pronounced changes with the cyclic hydrocarbon. The ratio of neopentane to isopentane (being the most abundant products from neohexane) was 12 over rhodium and 4.3 over 25%Rh/75%Cu. The ratio of ring opening products (2methylpentane/n-hexane) from methylcyclopentane was as follows: 14.2 over rhodium and 2.7 over 25%Rh/75%Cu/A1203 [34]. The sequence of reactivities over Ru/A1203 of high dispersion was similar to that observed with Rh/A1203 (compare Table 6 with Table 8, see later) while 2,2dimethylbutane was nearly as reactive as other hexane isomers over ruthenium sponge [ 35 ] . Dispersion effects at the same time brought about larger changes in methylcyclopentane ring opening: the ratio 2-methylpentane/n-hexane being 8.9 over Ru with D = 0.07 and 11.2 over ruthenium with D =1 [ 35 ] . A particularly large particle size sensitivity was seen over Rh/A1203 [30] (see also Section 8). The reactivities of 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane on platinum catalysts seemed to show the opposite trend to rhodium or ruthenium. It is not R. Burch, Z. Padl /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 9-33 23 clear if this is an intrinsic property of the metals in question or is due to different catalyst treatments or reaction conditions. Methylcyclopentane was more reactive than 2,2-dimethylbutane on Pt/Ti02 catalysts reduced at different temperatures [ 31,48 ] . The dramatic switch-over of the reaction of neohexane over Pt/Ti02 from the a/3 to ay mode was accompanied by a not very pronounced change in the selectivity of methylcyclopentane ring opening, the ratio 2-methylpentane/n-hexane decreasing from 8 to 5 in the same temperature range. 8. Factors influencing product distribution The selectivities reported as typical values e.g., in Table 3 may vary considerably as a function of actual catalyst sample, its origin, previous life and the experimental conditions. Pronounced particle size effects have been reported for platinum and iridium. Platinum catalysts with particle sizes from 0.85 to 14 nn were compared in neohexane reactions [44] . The support for more disperse catalysts was alumina while medium or larger crystallites were supported on silica. Hydrogenolysis selectivity of 80 to 95% was observed with the smallest crystallites, this value dropping to 20-30% for particles of 12-14 nm. The ratio of various interactions is also shown in Table 7 the first line referring to a Pt/A1203 catalyst, the second and third lines to Pt/Si02. It was claimed [44] that the change of support brought about no apparent effects in catalytic properties. However, the high isomerisation selectivity over EUROPT-1(see, for example, Table 3) as compared with the values observed on Pt/A1203 could certainly indicate that this statement may not have a general validity. Large crystallites of Ir/Si02 had an isomerisation selectivity up to 60% whereas this value reached 30% with smaller iridium particles. A heat treatment of the former at T> 380 brought the selectivity pattern close to that of the sample with smaller crystallite size [ 26 ] . The predominant isomer was 2-methylpentane (selectivity up to 30%) . Table 7 Neohexane reactions over platinum catalysts with different particle sizes (T= 300, H2/2,2-dimethylbutane=18. After ref.

Nickel with smaller crystallites gave somewhat more isobutane fragments than nickel with larger particles [ 27 ] . Higher temperatures also increased somewhat the ay' interaction, mostly at the expense of the ai interaction [ 27 ] . Particle size had no marked effect on the product distribution on ruthenium catalysts (hydrogenolysis mainly to neopentane), although the turnover frequency dropped considerably starting from a very low dispersion sponge to ruthenium with 105% dispersion [ 35 ] . The overall rate of reaction of 2,2-dimethylbutane showed a more marked particle size effect than hydrocarbons without a quaternary C atom over Ru /A1203 (Table 8) [ 35 ] which probably indicates the necessity of multiatom sites for its hydrogenolysis. At the same time only small changes in selectivity were observed, the main product in all cases being neopentane (compare Table 4). Similar marked particle size dependence was reported on Rh/A1203 [ 30] . When considering metal particle size effects, one has to remember that `true particle size effects' are often indistinguishable from `apparent particle size effects' induced by the support, different actual crystallite shapes, etc., which may not be reflected in the usual methods of measuring dispersion. Pretreatments in different atmospheres may change the equilibrium shape of small crystallites [49,50], hence they may expose active ensembles with different geometries. Variations in the reduction temperature can produce very pronounced selectivity changes with the same catalysts [ 22,24,45 ] . Table 9 shows selectivities obtained over a number of supported platinum and Pt-Re catalysts with dispersions between 0.6 and 1.0. Reduction of Pt/A1203 at 500 prior to experiment results in more (sometimes much more) isomerisation than after reduction at 300. No such effect is seen with EUROPT-1 where a pretreatment at 300 produces rather high amounts of isomers. A possible explanation of the higher isomerisation selectivity at higher reduction temperature can be extracted from the very detailed electron microscopy studies of Pt/A1203 [51].

Electron diffraction suggested the presence of Pt304and also A12Pt. Particle sizes were restored upon heating in hydrogen at 500 for 4 h (indicating that most of the surface of the visible particles had been reduced) but the diffraction rings did not disappear entirely. Although the oxidation took place at higher temperatures and longer times as compared with those applied in refs. [ 22,45 ] (oxygen treatment: 400, 2 h), the essence of the underlying phenomena may be the same. High isomerisation selectivities are generally concomitant with a high percentage of the ay' interaction. At the same time, ay interactions under these conditions generally give mainly isopentane, as indicated by its enhanced w value. This type of interaction is not particularly favourable for isomerisation: the amount of 3methylpentane is, as a rule, much lower than that of 2,3-dimethylbutane, which is the most abundant isomer. Note the rather large co value for neopentane over EUROPT-4 (0.3% Pt 0.3%Re/A1203), as compared with EUROPT-3 (0.3%Pt/ A1203), even at rather high values of isomerisation selectivity, due, most likely, to the intrinsic catalytic properties of rhenium. One may wonder if this may mean intimately mixed Pt-Re ensembles or rather isolated rhenium sites. Contradictory results have been reported for Pt/T'02 (Table 9); the different hydrogen /hydrocarbon ratio may be one reason for this difference. These variations, the marked support effect and the fact that the selectivities can be changed 26 R. Burch, Z.

Variations in the hydrogen pressure changed the product distribution remarkably (see Table 10) . These results for iridium catalysts are in good agreement with the suggestions of Foger and Anderson who proposed that the `iso-unit mode' reaction exemplified by the isomerisation of neopentane is preferred with lower hydrogen pressures (i.e., with a lower abundance of surface hydrogen). Indeed, both the ay' and the ay interactions are suppressed by higher amounts of hydrogen over iridium. Just the opposite hydrogen effect can be observed with platinum [ 47 ] where the to values published were also calculated considering also all fragments, hence they are not comparable with those quoted in the present study. Increasing the H2/2,2dimethylbutane ratio from 2 to 23 led to a 30% decrease in the abundance of isobutane (the preferred product), at the same time, isopentane and neopentane formation increased by a factors of 4 to 10. Hydrogen-rich conditions obviously were favourable for the ai6 interaction. It is also possible that the product distribution reported over Pt/Ti02 catalysts reduced at 400 (which were claimed as being in the SMSI state) at temperatures in the range 200-230, which gave only neohexane as the primary splitting product along with much propane [ 48 ] , could also be attributed to a hydrogen effect enhancing multiple splitting, the hydrogen excess being between 50 and 100 (not specified more clearly by the authors). Isopentane appeared at 229, and the distribution of hydrogenolysis products resembled that shown in Table 4 for Pt/ Ti02 reduced at 250, from a reaction temperature of 260 onwards [ 48 ] . Increasing the reaction temperature increased the contribution of isobutane (ay' interaction) even further over this catalyst as well as over Pt/Ti02 reduced at 460. Up to 5% isomerisation selectivity was reported over each of those Pt/Ti02 catalysts [ 31,48 ] . Increasing the hydrogen content of the carrier gas from 0 to 20% is accompanied by a rapid drop of the benzene yield; at the same time, skeletal isomers appeared which were not present in the carrier gas [ 25,52 ] . The sum of skeletal isomers plus benzene was roughly constant from 20 to 100% hydrogen (Fig. 3). This may indicate a skeletal rearrangement mechanism involving a deeply dehydrogenated intermediate which would produce benzene in helium. With some surface hydrogen present, a slower `normal' bond shift mechanism would be operative which could R. Burch, Z.

It would be logical to assign the dehydrogenative mechanism to multiatomic sites while that resulting in skeletal isomers to single-atom sites. It is worth mentioning that increasing the hydrogen pressure suppresses the hydrogenolysis yield considerably (30% in helium and about 4% in hydrogen at 390 over Pt black) [ 23 ] . Hydrogen effects over carbon-supported platinum catalysts have also been studied [ 53 ] . The maximum yield of skeletal isomers on 20% Pt/C at 310 was when the carrier gas of a pulse system contained 55-60% hydrogen; the isomerization activity was lower by a factor of 4 than that of 3-methylpentane. Carbonaceous deposits increased isomerisation selectivity over palladium, although an opposite effect was reported in one case for platinum (see Table 3) [9]. Isomerisation selectivities were very low (0.02 to 0.13%) over 10% Ir/AI203 [ 32] . Even within these low values, isomerisation selectivity increased with the temperature and with decreasing hydrogen/ hydrocarbon ratio. Hence, Sarkany attributed isomerisation to partly carbonized iridium surfaces, as in the abovementioned case of palladium. This agrees with the conclusion of Vogelzang and Ponec [26] who proposed that the higher isomerisation activity was due to randomly distributed `C' on Ir/Si02 which was considered to be different from the carbonaceous overlayer ('coke'). The lower maximum attainable isomerisation selectivity of small iridium particles as compared with that of large ones was attributed to their hindered `carburization'. A recrystallisation of larger crystallites at higher temperatures uncovering free iridium ensembles, was given as the reason for their isomerisation selectivity dropping upon high temperature treatment [ 26] . The different particle size sensitivity of 2,2-dimethylbutane reactions over iridium and platinum was also attributed to the more difficult carbon accumulation on iridium. 28 R. Burch, Z. Padl /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 9-33 The interplay of two additives - rhenium promoting hydrogenolysis, and carbon promoting isomerisation - has been mentioned in Section 6. Apart from the overall activity drop (due to the decrease of the number of active sites over carbonized catalysts), the effect of rhenium only becomes predominant in the rhenium-rich region [ 44 ] . It is not excluded that carbonaceous deposits playa more important role in determining the predominant reaction route than generally recognised. Individual C atoms may play a role similar to the presence of inactive alloying metal atoms [ 9 ] in breaking up large ensembles of contiguous metal atoms which may be active in catalyzing hydrogenolysis, perhaps by `tripod-like' 1,3,5-interactions [ 54] . Low temperatures generally are unfavourable for accumulation of either hydrocarbonaceous or carbonaceous deposits (the distinction is used to denote sorbed species with different degrees of dehydrogenation). Sarkany interpreted hydrogen effects in terms of hydrogen pressure regulating the amount of surface hydrocarbons [ 55 ] . Pt/Si02 at low temperatures with rather a lot of hydrogen present exhibited some unusual intrinsic multiple hydrogenolytic activity towards n-hexane. Individual clean metal atoms being present in a pool of hydrogen-covered metal surface may act as single-atom active sites [ 56] . Such centres were claimed to be more important on platinum than on other Group VIII metals [46]. Not only the outer surface of the finely divided metal particles may be covered by hydrogen after low temperature reduction (e.g., at 300) , but also a hydrogen layer may be present between small platinum particles and the support [ 57 ] . This may also contribute to their higher hydrogenolysis selectivity. As opposed to the rather pronounced isomerisation reported in Table 3, hydrogenolysis selectivities up to 95-98% together with multiple splitting (see above) have been observed over Pt/Ti02 catalyst reduced at different temperatures [ 31,48 ] . The differences between these results and those obtained over other platinum catalysts [9,44] may be rationalised in terms of the catalyst samples of Clarke et al. containing much lower amounts of surface carbon, and more surface hydrogen and/or OH groups (see later), than those of Ponec and co-workers. The Pt/Ti02 catalysts in question underwent almost no deactivation during a run of 45 min at the high hydrogen excess used and the product selectivities also remained unchanged. The lack of any surface carbonaceous deposits together with enhanced hydrogenolysis activity on hydrogen-rich surfaces may also explain why hydrogenolysis, leading mostly to neopentane, was the only reaction at lower temperatures (up to ca. 230) over iridium [ 26] . This, however, would surprisingly mean that at lower temperatures (with high hydrogen and low carbon coverages) the differences between platinum and iridium would tend to disappear i.e., the basically different selectivities of these metals would only manifest themselves in a moderately carburized state which must not be mixed up with the partially coked, more or less deactivated catalysts. Sulphur addition decreased the overall activity of a Pt-Re/A1203 catalyst by a few orders of magnitude, and at the same time increased isomerisation selectivity R. Burch, Z.

This was attributed to the acidic function of the alumina support, as corroborated by the pronounced drop of isomerisation ability upon adding a basic poison, pyridine to the catalyst. The isomerising propensity of Pts+ in sulphided catalysts may also play a role here, although this assumption has not been proved nor disproved. Chlorinated and chlorine-free catalysts did not differ qualitatively from each other [ 58] . The use of H2PtC16 as a precursor for preparing Pt-Re/A1203 catalysts resulted in about twice as active catalysts as the use of H2Pt(OH)6 [59]. The activity and the selectivity for the formation of neopentane increase with increasing platinum content with both precursors, which is at variance with the results of Botman et al. [44]. Higher isomerisation selectivity was observed over EUROrr-3 (prepared from Cl-containing precursor) after reduction at 500 than with a similar catalyst prepared from a chloride-free precursor (Table 9) . This may stress the well-known role of CI - ions in enhancing redispersion via Pts+ species [60], as discussed above in connection with oxidising treatments. Deliberate addition of chlorine, as CH2C12, during a catalytic run increased isomerisation selectivities considerably [ 22,45 ] (Table 11), with all the other concomitant features also being manifested: isomerisation selectivity increased; enhanced ay' interaction; enhanced c)(isopentane); and decreased formation of neopentane. At the same time, it was shown that the acidity of the catalyst did not increase upon introduction of CH2Cl2 so the increase in isomerisation selectivity could not be explained by a conventional bifunctional mechanism (see earlier discussion of ref. [ 21 ] ) . In any case, an acidic isomerisation should have produced 2,3-dimethylbutane while, in fact, both the yields and selectivities of all the other hexane isomers increased [ 22 ] . This effect of chlorine was reversible, and could be removed by prolonged exposure to the reactants, and could be brought about repeatedly. 30 R. Burch, Z. Padl /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 9-33 Introducing water to Pt/ A1203 (see Table 11) has the opposite effect: it increases hydrogenolysis selectivity. This phenomenon does not occur with Pt/Si02, hence it can be attributed to a more facile hydroxylation of the A1203 support and the interaction of the newly formed OH groups in the vicinity of platinum particles with the metal. In fact, OH groups were found to be stable over Pt black catalysts after oxygen and subsequent hydrogen treatments as detected by electron spectroscopy and the samples with enhanced OH content showed a higher hydrogenolysis selectivity [ 61 ] . Detailed clarification of the phenomena concerning Cl and water effects requires further studies and will be tackled in forthcoming publications. 9. Information obtained from the use of 2,2-dimethylbutane as probe molecule Garin and Maire [ 62 ] suggested that the chemical identity (platinum versus palladium etc.) of the metal catalyst (`the electronic factor') would be most important in determining the direction of reaction of any reactant. Adopting this general theory to 2,2-dimethylbutane, it is easy to realize the actual importance of the nature of the metal in determining the primary interaction. Mainly a/3 type interactions occur with metals like Rh, Ru, Ni, Re. These metals give, consequently, mostly hydrogenolysis products, particularly 2,2-dimethylpropane (neopentane). Using the classification of Foger and Anderson [ 8 ] , `C2-unit' reactions predominate on these catalysts (Table 4) . The product composition obtained from neohexane transformation is a clear indication whether mainly ay or a /3 types of interaction prevail. It is possible sometimes to follow the switch-over of the molecule from one state to the other. The occurrence of ay (or, including also ay', i.e., the `iso-unit' [8]) type interactions is necessary for isomerization reactions: this is possible with platinum, palladium, and, to some extent, iridium and nickel. Hence, a high isomerization selectivity should be accompanied with enhanced ay and ay' type interactions: experiments indicate that the latter produces most of the isomers (Tables 8 and 9). Once the `electronic factor' determined the prevailing interaction, the `geometric factor' was assumed to decide whether degradative or nondegradative reactions (i.e. hydrogenolysis or isomerization) follow [62]. If we define the geometric factor as the actual surrounding of the active centre at the atomic level, including the arrangement of the atoms and also their chemical nature, the experience collected in the present paper would certainly confirm this suggestion. One must not forget the postulation [3,4] that there is no `inert' additive effect, i.e., a different atom included into the matrix of an active catalyst changes the geometric arrangement and the electronic surroundings. One plausible way to change the ratio of individual reactions (isomerization versus hydrogenolysis) is the introduction of additional components. Ions of the catalyst metal itself (such as Pts+ ) may represent one possible additive promoting R. Burch, Z. Padl /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 9-33 31 isomerisation. A component with high hydrogenolysis activity (e.g., rhenium) changes not only the type of prevailing interaction but also the ratio of the abovementioned reactions, the extent of which may vary over a wide range [44,45]. Inactive metals (silver, gold), in contrast, decrease the hydrogenolysis and increase the isomerization selectivity with a considerable decrease in the overall activity. The same effect can be achieved by nonmetallic additives, such as carbon (Tables 3 and 10) , sulphur, and also chlorine (Table 11) . Copper has a peculiar effect: it enhances hydrogenolysis selectivity without a switch over to a preferential a/3 interaction, Pt-Cu ensembles having obviously an intrinsic hydrogenolysis ability, due, perhaps, to their hydrogen sorption ability [46]. The same explanation was offered for the effect of VOCI [46] which also can bind hydrogen. 10. Conclusion In conclusion, it is clear that many questions about the nature of active sites on metal catalysts still remain unanswered. Probe reactions can provide a very valuable in situ method of characterising real supported catalysts. Moreover, 2,2-dimethylbutane, because it can be adsorbed in a variety of different modes can be a very sensitive probe of the surface chemistry of metal catalysts. One important remaining question is how exactly to separate the influence of the chemical identity of the support from that of metal particle size. Indeed, platinum catalysts with rather similar (high) dispersion can have isomerisation selectivities from ca. 5 to 60% (Table 9). The scatter of data points was, indeed, rather large when particle size effects on platinum have been discussed and when results were obtained when platinum was supported on silica or alumina. Considering the rather large differences between EUROPr-1 and EURopr-3, platinum on different supports may not be directly comparable. Recent results indicate that various pretreatments (reduction temperature, etc., see Section 8) may represent an additional factor influencing selectivity values considerably. The presence of minute amounts of additives may also have a crucial influence (see the effects of carbon, chlorine, water, etc., discussed above). These may create an as yet unspecified electronic influence on the metal proper [ 21,48,63 ] which may manifest itself e.g., as the irregular catalytic activity of sites at the metal-support phase boundary (`adlineation effect' [ 64 ] ) . The higher isomerisation selectivity of catalysts with lower metal loading, i.e., containing more `adlineation sites' (see 0.3% and 2% Pt/A1203 in Table 9) may stress the importance of these sites in isomerisation (the importance of ay', ay and a/3 interactions being similar over all these samples), as also does the possible effect of oxidative redispersion of the catalytically active metal [ 51 ] . The problem of `true' bifunctionality, namely whether there is a real interplay between metallic sites and acidic sites in their immediate vicinity affecting reaction intermediates during their sojourn on the surface, still also needs to be clarified. Conventional dispersion measurements, or other, more sophisticated surface char- 32 R. Burch, Z. Padl /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 9-33 acterisation techniques may not provide a sufficient explanation for these problems. That is the point where the use of probe molecules, to investigate the active sites proper, may prove indispensable. Knowing the few elementary regularities of metal catalyzed reactions of 2,2-dimethylbutane, this reactant seems to be a great help in solving a number of still open questions concerning metal-hydrocarbon interactions on real catalysts.

Box 77, Budapest, H-1525, Hungary 1 Corresponding author. Probe molecules can be used to complement surface characterisation techniques for elucidating the nature of possible active sites in supported metal catalysts. 2,2-dimethylbutane (neohexane) is eminently suitable for this purpose because it combines an isobutyl and an ethyl group, representing two archetypes for hydrocarbon reactions on metal catalysts. In this review a survey is given of hydrogen-deuterium exchange, hydrogenolysis, and isomerization of 2,2-dimethylbutane mainly on Group 8–10 metals, copper, and rhenium, as well as on their various alloys. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange results are presented, and interpretations in terms of factors such as different surface morphologies are considered. For 2,2-dimethylbutane, hydrogenolysis is the main reaction on most catalysts. Isomerization is restricted to platinum, palladium, and to some extent to iridium and nickel. The relative importance of isomerisation versus hydrogenolysis has been examined and it is shown that this is critically dependent on a number of factors, such as the dispersion of the metal, alloy formation, non-metallic promoters, etc. The patterns of hydrogenolysis products can also be very informative because of the relationship between the observed product and the mode of adsorption of the 2,2-dimethylbutane molecule on different types of surface site. The use of 2,2-dimethylbutane to probe the surface composition of bimetallic particles has been discussed and the factors which influence the product distribution have been examined. The effect of non-metallic additives (water and chlorine) on the ratio of hydrogenolysis-to-isomerization is discussed and the possible important role of the metal-support interface (‘adlineation sites’) is pointed out.

        "dc:description": "Probe molecules can be used to complement surface characterisation techniques for elucidating the nature of possible active sites in supported metal catalysts. 2,2-dimethylbutane (neohexane) is eminently suitable for this purpose because it combines an isobutyl and an ethyl group, representing two archetypes for hydrocarbon reactions on metal catalysts. In this review a survey is given of hydrogen-deuterium exchange, hydrogenolysis, and isomerization of 2,2-dimethylbutane mainly on Group 8–10 metals, copper, and rhenium, as well as on their various alloys. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange results are presented, and interpretations in terms of factors such as different surface morphologies are considered. For 2,2-dimethylbutane, hydrogenolysis is the main reaction on most catalysts. Isomerization is restricted to platinum, palladium, and to some extent to iridium and nickel. The relative importance of isomerisation versus hydrogenolysis has been examined and it is shown that this is critically dependent on a number of factors, such as the dispersion of the metal, alloy formation, non-metallic promoters, etc. The patterns of hydrogenolysis products can also be very informative because of the relationship between the observed product and the mode of adsorption of the 2,2-dimethylbutane molecule on different types of surface site. The use of 2,2-dimethylbutane to probe the surface composition of bimetallic particles has been discussed and the factors which influence the product distribution have been examined. The effect of non-metallic additives (water and chlorine) on the ratio of hydrogenolysis-to-isomerization is discussed and the possible important role of the metal-support interface (‘adlineation sites’) is pointed out.",
