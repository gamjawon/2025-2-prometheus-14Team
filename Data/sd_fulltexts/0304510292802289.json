Kaminsky, A. Bark and R. Steiger Institute of Technical and Macromolecular Chemistry, University of Hamburg, BunOsstr. 45, D-2000 Hamburg 13 (Germany) Abstract In the past, only heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts were known to produce highly isotactic polyolefins. In recent years a large number of different chiral metallocenes have been found that, in combination with methylaluminoxane, also give isotactic polymers. The homogeneous systems allow the polymerization of cyclic olefins without any ringopening reaction. The metallocene and the aluminoxane form a complex that is nearly colloidal. The complexation is followed by an alkyl exchange and a ss-hydrogen abstraction, forming methane. The methane production depends on the catalyst concentration and leads to polymerization-inactive compounds. Introduction In the past, only heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts were known to produce highly isotactic polyolefins. Homogeneous systems were preferentially studied in order to understand the elementary steps of the polymerization, which is simpler in soluble systems. The situation has now changed, since in recent years a homogeneous catalyst based on metallocene and aluminoxane was discovered which is very active and which also gives isotactic polymers when chiral transition-metal compounds are used [ 1 ]. A number of chiral zirconocenes have been synthesized [2-5]. The first systems investigated were based on ethylene-bis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride as well as on ethylene-bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride (compounds 1 + 2). 75~ CIT, C~ CI (1) CI - Zr-Cl (2) 42<~ Replacing the ethylene bridge between the indenyl rings with a dimethylsilyl gave even higher activities and molecular weights [6 ]. Activities up to 115 000 kg PP (mol Zr)-1 could be obtained. The melting points of the polymers 0304-5102/92/$5.00 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved iio are lower than those of polyolefins prepared with heterogeneous catalysts because of randomly distributed stereoirregularities in the polymer chain. By using metallocenes with substituted cyclopentadienyl rings such as dimethylsilyl(2,3,5-trimethylcyclopentadienyl-2',4',5'-trimethylcyclopenta.- dienyl)zirconium dichloride, higher melting points are obtained [ 7 ]; reaching 162 C for isotactic polypropylene. With asymmetric ligands it became possible to synthesize syndiotactic polypropylene with a syndiotactic sequence length of more than 80, as determined by 13C NMR [8]. Preparation of polycycloalkenes The homogeneous systems allow the polymerization of cyclic olefins without any ring-opening reactions, which are typical for heterogeneous catalysts [9, 10]. The isotactic homopolymers of cyclic olefins, such as cyclopentene (3), norbornene (4), and dimethanooctahydronaphthalene (dmon) (5), show (3) (4) (5) some interesting properties. The polymers are insoluble, heat resistant up to temperatures above 400 C, and highly crystalline. The polymerization system becomes heterogeneous after some seconds. Polycycloalkenes are completely insoluble in common hydrocarbons. Copolymers of cyclopentene and ethene are amorphous when 4 wt.% of the cyclic monomer is incorporated. Materials with norbornene as comonomer show glass transition temperatures of over 130 C and could be used as materials for optical discs and fiber optics. The glass transition point depends on the content of cyclic units in the chain and rises with the incorporation rate. Table 1 compares the activities of the polymerization of cyclic olefins with chiral catalysts and the melting points of the homopolymers. The activity for the polymerization of cyclopentene is high, whereas the activities of norbornene and dimethanonaphthalene are significantly lower. At the same temperature the activity of cyclobutene is about five times that of cyclopentene. The catalyst Me2Si(ind)ZZrCl2 is more active than Et(ind)2ZrC12. Characteristics of polycycloolefins; polymerization of cyclic olefins X-ray diffraction and IR spectra can be used to characterize the insoluble homopolymers [11]. In interpreting these spectra it must be remembered that the polymerization of cyclic olefins by double-bond opening can lead to four different TABLE 1 Homopolymerization of cycloalkenes with Et(ind)zZrClz (catalyst I) and MezSi(ind)ZZrCl2 (catalyst II) in toluene' Monomer Catalyst Temp.

Cis opening of the double bond causes two erythro structures (erythrodiisotactic and erythrodisyndiotactic), while traps opening produces threodiisotactic and threodisyndiotactic structures. The IR spectra of polynorbornene, poly(dmon), and the copolymer are given in Fig. 1. The spectra indicated the incorporation of cyclic units. No vibrations stemming from double bonds at 1620 to 1680 cm-' are detected. 112 In all spectra the characteristic 5 CHZ deformation vibration could be seen at 1460 cm-1. Using higher zirconocene concentrations and temperatures, the molecular weight was lowered and oligomers were formed. They were found to be soluble in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at temperatures of about 100 C, so 13C NMR spectra could be measured. Comparison of the chemical shifts with model compounds led to the conclusion that the polycycloolefins are erythrodiisotactic when chiral catalysts are used. The oligomers melt at lower temperatures, as can be seen from the temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction diagram (Fig. 2). Oligo(dmon) shows a phase transition at 250 C and some peaks even at 400 C, meaning that the melting point is not reached. The sharp reflections at 50 C show the high crystallinity (over 60ss'o). More information on the structure of polynorbornene is gained from \"C CP MAS (Cross Polarization Magic Angle Spinning) spectroscopy (Fig. 3). The peaks are not completely separated, as in the case of polycyclopentene. The signal shows at least four main peaks, as expected for an erythrodiisotactic structure. The splitting suggests that the insertion has taken place in more than one stereospecinc way. It is also possible to copolymerize cyclic olefins. Surprisingly, the copolymerization yields crystalline polymers. Compared with IR spectra of the homopolymers, the spectrum of the copolymer (Fig. 1) shows that the product is not merely a mixture of the homopolymers, but a new polymer material with different absorptions. At 575 and 1095 cm-1 new bands appear that can be assigned to norbornene-dmon vibrations. aoo ~ 0 '~ 16 e A B Mg. 2.

'3C NMR spectrum (75.47 MHz) of polynorbornene in the solid state. Mechanism Even at - 60 C the metallocene and the aluminoxane form a complex, as shown by a new absorption maximum at 400 nn in the IR spectrum. The complex is nearly colloidal. Following the complexation there are rapid alkylations, and as a side reaction some evolution of methane is observed [12]. Under a-hydrogen transfer a condensation of the metallocene and methylaluminoxane (MAO) takes place, which is much faster with MAO than with trimethylaluminum. Zr -iCH3 + HiCH2 \\A1 - 0 --j Zr - CH2 - A1 - O CH3 CH3 + CHq The condensation rate depends on the structure of the zirconocene and on the Al/Zr ratio (Fig. 4). A large excess of MAO accelerates the methane production. With a small excess, Cp2ZrC12 and Cp2Zr(CH3)Cl give higher rates than (Cp2ZrC1)20 or CpzZr(CH3)2. For an Al/Zr ratio of 420 the methane evolution depends on the concentration of the catalyst (Fig. 5). More than 50 moles of methane could be eliminated per mole of zirconium in 2 h. This suggests that under polymerization conditions at 10-6 mol 1-' of zirconocene this side reaction is relatively fast. The resulting Zr-CHZ-Al 114 2-0 `i E U o E 1,0 -i 0,5 .

This explains the delay in catalytic activity of the system. But there is a way to reactivate this structure: adding an excess of MAO causes the formation of Al-CHZ Al structures next to active Zr--CH3 structures. Zr CHZ-Al/,-4 \\Zr-CH3 + jAl-CH2-Al-0CH3 A1-0- CH3 CH3 This reaction, the starting complexation, and the following reactions were monitored by dynamic IH NMR spectroscopy. Using CpzZrCl2, the cyclopentadienyl rings give sharp signals, which have a different chemical shift for all intermediates. 1H NMR is faster than \"C NMR spectroscopy because of shorter accumulation times. Table 2 shows 8 values for the main signals of the used educt compounds. MAO gives a characteristic signal with a half-width w(1 /2) =120 Hz at 8 = - 0.3 ppm in the alkyl proton region. The structural inhomogeneity of the MAO leads to some broadening of all the other signals, when MAO is bonded in a complex or coordinated to the zirconocenes. The Cp2ZrC12-MAO complex gives a 1H NMR signal for the Cp protons at 5.70 ppm. Starting from CpzZrC12 the first step of the complexation and alkylation with MAO is therefore: Cp2ZrC12 + (Al(CH3)-O)n ~ Cp,ZrC12'(AI(CH,)-O), complex I 1l Cp2Zr(CH3)Cl+(AL,(CH3)n_,OnCI) Cp2Zr(CH3)Cl*(AL (CH3)n_IOnCI) complex II In a following alkylation Cp2Zr(CH3)z is formed: CpzZr(CH3)Cl + MAO = Cp2Zr(CH3)2 + (Aln(CH3)n _ 1 OnCl). In this context it is remarkable that even with a twentyfold excess of Al/ Zr, the first alkylation, forming Cp2ZrC1(CH3), is not quantitative.

After nearly 15 min compounds with broader Cp signals could be seen in all cases. They are explained by the following reaction: o/ O/ \\A1 - CH3 A1-CH3 Ci3 Cp O/ CH3 0, Cp ,0 CH3 O-A1 Zr\\ + \\Al/ ~Z r\\- ~Al\\ -i CPZZr\\ O- Cp I CH3 CH3 Cp CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 8 4 6 +A1(CH3)3 Compound 8 contains the structural element Zr-O-Al. The Zr-O bond has a polar character and could be of ionic nature, as some authors have suggested [ 13, 14 ]. Figure 6 shows the whole scheme of the complex reactions. The reaction of the oxobridged zirconocene I gives Cp2Zr(CH3)Cl as a first reaction product. The formation of this species must proceed by an alkylation step and cleavage of the Zr-O bond. Parallel to the NMR investigation, samples of zirconocene and MAO were used as a catalyst in propene polymerizations after different prereaction times to gain more information on the nature of the active site. Table 3 correlates polymerization activity with methane evolution as a function of reaction time and gives some properties of the atactic polypropylene products. The table shows that 15 min after mixing the metallocene with MAO the polymerization activity attains its maximum value; the production of methane is low. The formation of methane increases with decreasing polymerization activity. This leads to the conclusion that reactions producing Zr-CHZ-A1 or -Al-CHZ A1 structures are side reactions that form inactive catalysts. Structure 8 could be the active site, because it shows a concentration maximum at that time. However, this picture is still too simple. The 3 o+ 0-(A1(CH3)-)n-A1 C5 - / CH (g) Cp2ZfCH3 CH3 influence of MAO goes beyond the alkylation and coordination of the metallocene. EXAFS spectroscopic measurements and the effect of excess MAO indicate that the active complex looks like a cluster consisting of the transitionmetal complex surrounded by one or two aluminoxane chains. To make this picture more concrete, more has to be learned about the structure of aluminoxane. Reactions similar to those described above are found when using chiral bis(indenyl)zirconocenes.

Proposed model for the isotactic polymerization of norbornene by a chiral zirconocene/ MAO catalyst. the ligands and by the bridge between the five-membered rings. The space between the optimally positioned ligands, which is controlled by the bridge, allows the monomer to be first -rr-complex-bonded and then inserted into the zirconium-carbon bond in one position only. For the norbornene polymerization, 13C NMR measurements indicate an erythrodiisotactic structure for blocks shown in Fig. 7. This orientation is likely because next to the bridged ligand and the associated co-catalyst, the growing chain blocks the monomer 7r-bond. The insertion of the olefin will be sterically hindered if the approach takes place in an orientation with the monomer rotated by 180 about the axis shown in Fig. 7. References 1 H. Sinn, W.
