From the results of different characterization tech- niques, it was concluded that the precipitated vanadium-phosphorus oxide phase was amorphous and that it was very well dispersed over the surface of the support. Also, it was found that the active phase exhibited a very strong interaction with the titania support. The prepared catalysts already showed activity at remarkably lower temperatures than industrially utilized catalysts. However, the selectivity at high conversions was small. The performance of the catalyst was found to be related to the reducibility of the active phase. For this system, an enhanced reducibility was detected due to the strong interaction of the active phase with the titania support, which was proved to be a function of the vanadium loading. The activity and selectivity in the oxidation of n-butane were only slightly affected by the installed P/V ratio.

Introduction The potentiality to support vanadium-phosphorus oxide (V-P-O) catalysts has been barely investigated. Although supported V-P-O systems are men- tioned particularly in the patent literature, the study on and use of supported systems in the catalytic oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride (MA) are * Corresponding author.

Overbeek et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) 209-230 restricted to publications in the open literature. Generally, oxides are solely used as an inert material to dilute the active V-P-O phase [1-4] or to enhance the attrition resistance of catalysts to be used in fluidized-bed reactors [5] or riser-reactors [6]. Nakamura et al. [7] described the first supported V-P-O catalysts. They prepared alumina-supported catalysts for the selective oxidation of 1-butane to MA and obtained reasonably high selectivities. The selectivity appeared to be enhanced by the average oxidation state of the active vanadium centers. Unfortunately, the above authors did not investigate the selective oxidation of n-butane on this type of catalysts. Although, it is generally accepted that the activation of n-butane is crucial, the results of this study have shown that supported V-P-O catalysts can be utilized for the selective oxidation of Ca-molecules to MA. Ramstetter and Baerns [8] used an alumina-supported V-P-O catalyst as a model system to obtain more detailed information on the processes occurring on the surface of these catalysts. Varma and Saraf [9] studied the selective oxidation of 1-butene over silica-gel supported V-P-O systems and found that MA could be obtained with reasonable selectivities. Zazhigalov et al. [10] prepared immobilized V-P-O/SiO2 catalysts by absorp- tion onto the silanol groups of the silica surface of VOC13 and POC13 in a CCIa environment. These catalysts were tested in the selective oxidation of n-butane. The formation of mixed phosphorus and vanadium oxide containing clusters improved the activity and the selectivity in the oxidation reaction as compared to vanadium oxide clusters. Although crystalline V-P-O modifications were ab- sent, the authors could not establish if the active phase was well-dispersed at the support surface. DereMnski et al. [11] investigated the oxidation of n-butane over silica-supported vanadium(V) oxide catalysts. Although they did not add phosphorus to the catalyst, they found significant amounts of MA in their product stream. With titania-supported vanadium(V) oxide catalysts, which were active at substantially lower temperatures, they did not obtain the product aimed at, but merely acetic acid. From these results, they deduced the presence of different kinds of oxygen species on the surface of the supported catalysts. The difference in product distribution was attributed to the difference in activity of the various oxygen species: electrophilic species would lead to C-C bond cleavage, whereas nucleophilic species would lead to selective oxidation prod- ucts [ 12]. Kuo and Yang studied A1POa as a support material for V-P-O catalysts [13]. The catalysts were tested in the oxidation of 1-butene, and the results revealed that reasonable selectivities to MA could be obtained. To enable comparison with the A1POa-supported systems the authors also studied silica-supported V-P-O catalysts, having a high specific surface area and narrow pores. These catalysts showed a lower selectivity than the A1POa supported system. Unfortu- nately, they did not present test data on the selective oxidation of n-butane. Martinez-Lara et al. [14] prepared both titania- and silica-' supported' o~- R.A. Overbeek et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) 209-230 211 VOPO4 catalysts. No interaction was found between the V-P-O phase and the silica support. Titania, on the other hand, was supposed to be covered by the active component. Testing of the catalysts in the selective oxidation revealed that with the titania-supported catalysts, the oxidation proceeded exclusively to CO2, even at temperatures as low as 200. The presence of a small amount of Fe2+-ions caused the catalyst to deactivate severely, but the selectivity to the desired product increased remarkably. The authors attributed these effects to the reduction of part of the V5+ in the catalyst to V4 With respect to the study on the supported catalysts, basically one statement can be made: although the use of supported catalysts gave promising results, it is unclear whether the active V-P-O phase was well dispersed on the surface of the oxide support. The titania-supported catalysts showed a high dispersion, but they were very selective to CO2. Since, these catalysts were prepared from VS+-compounds and, since, it was found that the presence of V4probably increases the selectivity to MA, the preparation using vanadium compounds of a lower valence state might possibly affect the catalytic behavior positively. The use of silica and alumina or aluminum phosphates as support materials possibly showed the best prospects, since, these supports solely act as a material increasing the active surface area with probably no effect on the activity and properties of the applied V-P-O phase. However, stabilization of a defect-rich V-P-O phase at a reducible support material, such as titania, may also enhance the reactivity of the lattice oxygen in the selective oxidation reaction. The selectivity could then possibly be controlled by installing the reactivity of the lattice oxygen of the applied active phase. Using a recently developed preparation procedure, we are able to obtain well-dispersed supported V-P-O catalysts. In the present study, we investigate titania-supported catalysts and test their performance in the selective oxidation of n-butane. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of supported V-P-O catalyst precursors Supported vanadium phosphate catalysts were prepared according to the newly developed preparation routine for supported V-P-O catalysts. This procedure takes place in aqueous medium and consists of two major steps: 1. the electrochemical reduction of pentavalent vanadium-ions in diluted hydro- chloric acid solutions to a vanadium species of an average valence state which can be installed; 2: the subsequent deposition-precipitation of the lower valent species from homogeneous aqueous solution, whether or not in combination with phos- phate as a counter-ion, onto suspended support bodies by injecting ammonia. 212 R.A. Overbeek et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996)209-230 An amount of a vanadium solution, in which vanadium had an chosen average valence state between typically three and four, was added to a vigor- ously stirred suspension of the titania support (Degussa P25), which was kept under nitrogen. The quantity of the carrier in each preparation was kept constant at typically about 10 g/1. Before the precipitation was started, an amount of NH4H2PO4 was added to the suspension. The deposition-precipitation of the vanadium was executed under continuous nitrogen purging to prevent the oxidation of the lower valent vanadium species. The starting pH of the prepara- tion was typically 1 and the pH was raised to a level of 7 by continuous injection of ammonia (60 ml/h; [NH3] = 1 wt.-%) by means of a Gilson minipuls peristaltic pump under the surface of the liquid. To ensure homogene- ity, the liquid was vigorously stirred using a Heidolph mechanical stirrer. To enable one to examine the influence of the established vanadium loading of the support material, the P/V ratio installed during the preparation and the initial average valence state of vanadium (AV), series of samples were prepared with different quantities of vanadium deposited on the support, with different P/V ratios and with varying AV's. After precipitation, the solid catalyst precursors were filtered off, washed with water and dried in air at 125. All catalyst samples were calcined in a nitrogen flow at 450 for 16 h. 2.2. Characterization procedures Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were recorded on a Micromeritics ASAP 2400 apparatus. Samples were characterized after calcination in nitrogen at 450 for 16 h and after being subjected to the catalytic reaction. Surface areas were calculated according to the BET theory. X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained at room temperature using an Enraf Nonius Guinier Johansson camera (Cu K a, A = 1.5406 A) with calcined catalyst samples and with samples being subjected to the catalytic reaction. The samples were mounted on a mylar foil using vaseline. For transmission electron microscopic (TEM) examinations, calcined samples were finely grounded in an agate mortar, suspended in ethanol and submerged for about 60 s in an ultrasonic bath to ensure homogeneity of the suspension. Drops of the suspension, thus prepared, were applied to holey carbon films supported by copper grids. The samples were investigated in a Philips CM-200 electron microscope supplied with an energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX) equipment. X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra were recorded on a VG Microtech XP Clam II analyzer using a Mg-source (1253.6 eV) operating at 10 mA. Well grounded samples, both after calcination and after being subjected to the catalytic reaction, were mounted on a sample holder with double-sided adhesive tape. For correction of shifts, measured binding energies were calibrated using R.A. Overbeek et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) 209-230 213 the position of the Ti 2P3/2 peak of TiO2 at 458.5 eV. To calculate peak areas, backgrounds were subtracted according to a procedure suggested by Shirley [15]. From the measured intensities of vanadium of the applied active compo- nent and the positive ion of the support material, the coverage of the support material was determined using a program developed by Gijzeman [16]. This program is based on the method described by Kuipers et al. [17]. Ex situ infrared spectra of the catalysts after being subjected to the catalytic reaction and after calcination in synthetic air or nitrogen were recorded at room temperature in atmospheric air. Because of the high absorptions of the pure catalysts, samples were diluted (1:10) with highly grounded KBr powder (Merck, p.a.). All DRIFT spectra were recorded ratioed against the background of KBr with a resolution of 8 cm-1 (apodization weak) and averaged over 256 scans using a Perkin Elmer 1600 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer equipped with a TGS detector. Temperature-Programmed Reduction (TPR) experiments were executed in a 70% H2/30% Ar mixture with a flow of 50 ml/min. About 100 mg of catalyst was pressed (4 ton. cm-2, 5 min), crushed, and sieved (fraction 0.41-0.72 mm). Analysis of the hydrogen consumption was performed using a thermal conductivity detector. Water, evolved during reduction, was removed from the gas-stream using a cold trap. Catalysts were analyzed after catalytic tests. 2.3. Catalyst pretreatment and performance testing After calcination in nitrogen at 450 for 16 h, calcined catalyst samples were pressed (4 ton cm-2, 5 min), crushed and sieved (fraction 0.41-0.72 mm). The thus obtained sieve fraction was pretreated and tested in the catalytic oxidation of n-butane according to the following procedural steps: 1. 1.5 ml of the sample was heated in argon up to 380 at a rate of 300h-l; at this temperature the precursor was kept for 1 h in a 20% 02/80% Ar flow (GHSV = 2000 h-1). 2. Subsequently, the catalyst precursor was brought in a 1.5% n-butane, 20% oxygen and 78.5% argon flow and kept at 380. 3. All pretreated catalyst samples were tested in the selective oxidation of n-butane in the temperature range from 380 to 200. The reaction mixture consisted of 1.5% n-butane, 20% oxygen and 78.5% argon as balance (GHSV = 2000 h-1). The catalytic performance was measured during 2 h at each set temperature, which was varied stepwise with 20. The evolved gaseous reaction products as well as the unconverted reactants were analyzed using a specially adapted on-line Balzers QMA420 mass-spec- trometer, which operates at 150 to avoid condensation of products. The conversion of the different m/z values to concentrations of the different evolved products was executed using a self-developed computer program. After 214 R.A.

Characterization of titania-supported catalysts BET-surface areas of the catalysts after calcination and of the bare titania support are summarized in Table 1. As displayed in this table, the surface areas of the supported catalysts are slightly lower as in comparison to the bare support. Also, it is shown that the maxima of the pore size distribution shifted to lower values. Therefore, in Fig. 1 the pore size distribution of the titania support bodies and, for reason of comparison, of a titania-supported catalyst are pre- sented. Presumably, the active component is uniformly covering the surface of the support bodies, causing the pores to become narrower. The decreased surface area may also result from the above described effect, due to the decreased roughening of the support surface with the supported catalyst. 0.05 0.04 =, o 0.03 0.02 O P 0.01 jl / / / J . , Titania Degussa P25 ] calcined ] -- 2.9 wt.% VFfiO2 / 1 P/V=I. 1 calcined J ..... 1 10 100 pore radius (nm) Fig. I.

Using X-ray diffraction analysis, no crystalline phases other than the anatase and futile modification of titania could be detected with all supported catalyst samples, even up to a vanadium loading of 5.8 wt.-%. Since, crystalline V-P-O modifications were absent it may be concluded that the applied V-P-O phase had to be amorphous. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) also revealed that the precipitated V-P-O phase was very well dispersed on the surface of the support bodies. Fig. 2 shows a high-resolution TEM micrograph of a titania-supported V-P-O catalyst after calcination of the sample in nitrogen (2.9 wt.-% loading on the basis of vanadium, P/V ratio 1.1). Since, no large crystallites and no particles other than those of titania could be detected, elemental analysis had to be applied to verify the presence of a uniform layer. Therefore, an energy disper- sive analysis of X-rays (EDAX) experiment was executed to determine the surface-composition of the visualized particles. This experiment revealed that the surface was composed of vanadium, oxygen and phosphorus, indicating a high dispersion of the active component over the support. Fig. 3 shows a scheme of the actual methodology of scanning the edge and center of the titania crystallites. Also summarized are the atomic ratios, as measured with this technique, and a representation of the image which can be deduced from these results. It is noteworthy that the characterized P/V ratio was exactly that of initially installed proportion. XPS-measurements of titania-supported V-P-O catalysts revealed that the 216 R~A.

EDAX-results of the with HRTEM investigated titania-supported V-P-O catalyst samples. support material was completely covered with a V-P-O phase. In Table 2 the surface ratios determined with XPS as well as the binding energies (BE) of the V 2p3/2 peak are shown both after calcination in nitrogen at 450 and after being subjected to the catalytic oxidation reaction. The supported catalysts all have a surface P/V ratio increased as compared to the installed bulk ratio Of 1.1. It can be concluded also that the O/Ti ratio with the bare support sample is lower than that of the supported catalyst. The O/Ti ratios are reasonable, when it is taken into account that the V-P-O phase applied onto the support has a higher oxygen concentration than titania itself (e.g., in case of TiO2, the O/Ti ratio is 2, and with VOPO4, the O/V ratio is 5). When, however, the catalyst is covered with the active component, the titania concentration in the first surface layers that are measured by XPS decreases. Therefore, the O/Ti ratio must decrease due to a higher surface coverage of the support with the active component, which is actually the case. When the Ti/V ratio is calculated, the above described observation can also be noticed. The Ti/V ratio clearly decreases at higher V-P-O loadings. It is also interesting to note that the Ti/V ratio of the catalyst had decreased after subjecting the samples to the catalytic reaction. This is probably caused by spreading of the catalytically active material over the support surface, due to a structural change Table 2 Binding energies as well as surface ratios of the different elements of interest determined by XPS; between brackets, the starting valence state of vanadium in the catalyst preparation is given Catalyst sample V 2p3/2 P/V O/V Ti/V BE (eV) ratio ratio ratio 4.4 wt.-% V(2.9)/TiO2 P/V = 1.1 calcined N2 517.2 2.7 28.1 7.4 4.4 wt.-% V(2.9)/TiO2 P/V = 1.1 after react. 516.9 2.6 16.4 3.9 2.9 wt.-% V(2.9)/TiO2 P/V = 1.1 calcined Nz 516.8 2.8 22.5 5.9 2.9 wt.-% V(2.9)/TiOz P/V = 1.1 after react. 517.0 3.0 19.6 5.4 2.9 wt.-% V(3.4)/TiO2 P/V= 1.1 calcined N2 517.0 2.1 17.5 5.3 2.9 wt.-% V(3.7)/TiOz P/V = 1.1 calcined N2 517.0 1.2 15.2 5.0 2.9 wt.-% V(3.7)/TiO2 P/V = 1.1 after react. 517.1 1.6 19.2 5.8 2.6 wt.-% V(2.9)/TiO2 P/V= 1.1 calcined N2 516.7 1.7 25.4 6.7 2.6 wt.-% V(2.9)/TiO2 P/V= 1.1 after react. 516.8 2.5 18.2 5.7 2.2 wt.-% V(2.9)/TiO2 P/V = 1.1 calcined N2 516.7 2.2 27.2 10.6 2.2 wt.-% V(2.9)/TiO2 P/V= 1.1 after react. 516.9 2.2 23.2 7.8 R.A. Overbeek et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) 209-230 217 under reaction conditions [18-20]. It appears that the mean valence states of vanadium in the various samples after calcination and after reaction are equal and probably have a value between four and five. Also, it can be concluded that the initial valence state of vanadium in the preparation procedure did not have any effect on the valence state after calcination and after reaction, as well as on the dispersion of the active phase on the support surface. It is noteworthy that the P/V ratio calculated from the XPS results was measured to be higher than the installed P/V ratio. This calculated ratio was also higher than that determined using EDAX, which value equalized the installed proportion. It is possible that the V-P-O layer is terminated by a phosphate layer. This would be in agreement with the results of measurements by Haas et al. [21]. Since, the XPS signal only contains the characteristics of the surface layers, it is very likely that the measured ratio indicates a phosphate enrichment at the surface. Hence, we feel that the applied phase is terminating in a phosphate-layer or that the increased ratio is originating from a coverage of the surface with isolated phosphate-groups, the amount of which will increase with the installed P/V ratio. From intensities of vanadium and titania assessed by XPS, the surface coverage of the support as well as the particle size of the applied V-P-O phase was determined using a program developed by Gijzeman [16]. This program is based on a procedure described by Kuipers et al. [t7]. The assumption was made that the support was covered with VOPO4, since, XPS measurements indicated that vanadium had a valence state higher than four. Values of the variables used in the XPSCAT program [16] are summarized in Table 3. Results of the calculations are summarized in Table 4. From these results, the earlier indicated spreading of the active component over the support surface brought about by the catalytic reaction was substanti- ated. It was also found that the coverage of the support surface increased clearly with the loading of the active component. Very high coverages were found already at loadings of 4.4 wt.-% on the basis of vanadium. From the TEM Table 3 Values of variables used in the XPSCAT program [19].

These measurements in combination with the EDAX experiments revealed that the active phase was present as a layer, which indicates that the results of the XPSCAT calculations in which a layered geometry was assumed are the most likely.

The difference spectra of the supported catalyst samples and that of the support show a broad absorption band in the region 1200-800 cm-1, indicating that in this region the absorptions of the covering V-P-O phase are not well defined. Sofia et al. [22] studied the interaction of phosphoric acid with titania surfaces and found that both the absorption vibrations of physically adsorbed water and the stretching vibrations of P-OH groups were present; according to those results, the absorptions in the region 3800-2600 cm-1 can be ascribed to the vibrations of physically ad- sorbed water and the stretching vibrations of P-OH groups. Also, the bending vibration of water can be found at about 1650 cm-1. In the energy region of 1200-800 cm-l, bulk V-P-O catalysts generally show some clearly resolved absorption vibrations [23]. The absence of a fine-structure may be due to the strong interaction of the active phase on the support or to the absence of a well-defined structure of the applied V-P-O phase. Also, absorptions below 1000 cm-1 are very badly detected or even totally obscured by the very intense absorption vibrations in this region of the titania support, itself. Therefore, clear conclusions with respect to the nature of the V-P-O phase applied on the titania support cannot be drawn. An increased coverage of the support led to a clear increase in the absorbance in this region. Also, the fine structure on the broad band became more apparent, which is possibly connected with a decreased influence of the support on the applied V-P-O phase.

TPR patterns of titania-supported catalysts after catalytic test reactions. Represented are catalysts of varying vanadium loading with a P/V ratio of 1.1. All patterns are normalized at the quantity of catalyst in the reactor. at 450. It appears that the amount of physisorbed water did not change with the P/V ratio. The absorptions of the (phosphate) vibrations in the region 1200-900 cm-l, however, increased with the P/V ratio. The more intensive phosphate vibrations may be ascribed to an increase of the concentration of phosphate groups at the surface of the catalyst, which agrees with the XPS results that indicated the surface of the applied V-P-O phase to be enriched with phosphate. From other experiments, we found that a maximum P/V ratio of 1.1 could be incorporated in the bulk of V-P-O catalysts. It appears that the active V-P-O phase supported on titania is different from the bulk V-P-O catalyst prepared following the similar preparation procedure. We think, how- ever, that also at the surface of the bulk V-P-O catalyst a more than stoichiometric amount of phosphorus can be present. Results obtained with electrokinetic sonic amplitude support this presumption [18]. When the differ- ence spectra are considered, an absorption vibration at around 940 cm-~ appears to be present, which can be ascribed to a P-OH stretching vibration. Absorp- tions of the P-O-P bending vibrations in the pyrophosphate structure and PO3 skeletal vibrations at 745 and 635 cm-l, respectively, are not found, but this may be caused by the very intense absorption vibrations of titania itself in this region. Fig. 6 shows the reducibility of the differently loaded catalysts that had a constant P/V ratio of 1.1. A change in the P/V ratio from about 1 to 2 had no effect on the reducibility of the catalysts. As can be observed, the on-set of the reduction was 205,235,240 and 250 for catalysts with a vanadium loading of R.A.

Normalized reducibility in mmol H2 per unit weight of titania-supported V-P-O catalyst as a function of the applied vanadylpyrophosphate (VPP) loading. All catalysts had an installed P/V ratio of hl. 2.2, 2.9, 4.4, and 5.6 wt.-%, respectively. It is noteworthy that the area under the TPR peak did hardly increase with the vanadium loading. The amount of H2, consumed as a function of the loading calculated as vanadylpyrophosphate, for comparison with industrial bulk systems, is therefore presented in Fig. 7. It appears that the reducibility of the catalyst, as measured by the consumption of H2, which was calibrated by the reduction of CuO to Cu, was constant up to a loading of 8.1 wt.-%, which is exactly that of a theoretical monolayer. The data of Fig. 7 indicate that the quantity of oxygen being consumed in the hydrogen reduction per unit weight of vanadium was, thus, not constant for the different vanadium loadings, which is evident from Fig. 8. From this figure, it can be deduced that the reducibility of the applied V-P-O phase decreased with the vanadylpyrophosphate loading up to a loading of 9 wt.-% and assumed a constant value only at higher loadings. Since it is known from XPS results that in all cases the valence state was about equal, it must be concluded that titania itself is reduced. However, if the reducibility of pure titania was measured by means of TPR, no consumption of hydrogen was observed. The 'induced reducibility' of the titania support is most probably due to the strong interaction of the applied V-P-O phase with the support material. The strong interaction makes available additional, highly active, oxygen atoms originating from the titania surface. We, therefore, gather that at the edges of the interface of the applied V-P-O phase with the titania support titania can be reduced due to the formation of a redox-couple with vanadium. The quantity of hydrogen consumed per unit of active component decreases, since, the ratio between the number of interfacial edge sites of active V-P-O particles and the amount of applied vanadiumphos- 222 R.A.

Calculations for the higher vanadium loadings exhibiting a constant reducibility per unit weight show that the initial valence state of vanadium had a value of about 4.2, which is in agreement with the XPS measurements. For these calculations, it was assumed that all vanadium was reduced to the trivalent state and that no Tin+-atoms were reduced in the TPR experiments. The on-set of the reduction is probably correlated with the strength of the interaction of the applied active phase with titania. If vanadium is bonded via bridging oxygen atoms to only one Ti4+-atom, the interaction is said to be smaller than if two or more Ti4atoms are bonded to a vanadium site. The amount of vanadium sites per titanium atom is a function of the degree of coverage. At the lower coverages, it is probable that more than one titania atom is bonded to a vanadium site. Since, the dissociation of a H2 molecule is influenced by the defect density at the V-P-O surface, the V-Ti interaction will also have an effect on the on-set of the reduction. As is mentioned earlier, the on-set of the reduction shifted to higher temperatures when the loading was increased, which agrees with the above hypothesis. 3.2. Catalyst pretreatment and performance testing Results of the catalytic activity testing of the n-butane oxidation in a fixed-bed reactor are summarized in Figs. 9 and 10. In Fig. 9, results are shown obtained with the catalysts of a different loading of vanadium on the support material, all with a P/V ratio of 1.1.

Since, the catalytic reaction is highly exothermic, heat effects cannot be neglected. When, however, the selectivity is represented as a function of conversion, temperature effects can be considered negligible. Plotting the selec- tivity as a function of the conversion enables us to compare easily catalyst samples, since, the temperature is now an independent variable. ~J =- ;> L) 1 O0 \" \"~'~'~ i Conversion / 1 Sel.

Overbeek et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) 209-230 225 It is remarkable that the supported catalysts already show some activity at a temperature of 200, whereas, industrially applied catalysts are active at higher temperatures only. It can be observed also that the catalytic activity increases when the vanadium loading decreases. The selectivity at higher conversions (above about 50%), however, rises when the coverage of the support increases from a loading of 2.2 to 2.9 wt.-% on the basis of vanadium. As stated above, the interaction of the vanadium phosphate phase with the support is strong, increasing the reduction as well as the oxidation capacity of the catalyst surface. It is possible that the applied active phase reorganizes its structure to fit on top of the support material. The, thus, formed surface structure of the applied V-P-O phase has a higher activity than the surface structure formed on top of bulk vanadium-phosphorus-oxides, since, the reactivity of the surface oxygen species is higher. The increased activity, however, probably causes the selectiv- ity to MA to decrease. The activity for the sequential oxidation of MA to carbon oxides may increase due to the increased reactivity of the oxygen species. It is also possible that titania itself shows catalytic activity, causing the uncovered parts of the support to oxidize n-butane non selectively to CO and CO2. To test this hypothesis, the titania support was tested in the selective oxidation of n-butane. From these experiments, it was found that titania shows only a very small catalytic activity (about 1-3% in the temperature region from 200-300) and that CO was formed as the only oxidation product. The high activity of the titania-supported catalysts is thus caused by the strong interaction of the active phase with the support, which interaction is a function of the degree of coverage of the support. As mentioned above the strong interaction even causes an 'induced reducibility' of the titania support, i.e., an availability of extra, highly active, oxygen atoms originating from the titania surface. The higher the degree of coverage with the active components, the smaller the interaction and the activity in the selective oxidation reaction. The activity and selectivity of the supported catalysts will consequently have an optimum at a certain level of vanadium coverage, but this level is not established as yet. However, because the selectivity to MA is also a function of the coverage of the support, it is interesting to assess the optimum in MA production. Comparing the obtained results with the results published by Martinez-Lara et al. [14], it is obvious that the method of preparation has an enormous influence on the performance of the catalysts. The titania-supported catalysts prepared according to our procedure showed similar selectivities as their Fez+ promoted catalysts. The unpromoted catalysts were very reactive but poorly selective: they obtained CO2 as the sole reaction product. These results were ascribed to the absence of V4+-centers at the catalyst surface in the unpromoted catalysts (the catalysts were prepared from V5 +-compounds). They proposed that the presence of Fe2+ caused the catalyst to deactivate due to a reduction of part of the V5+ in the catalyst to V4+. The formation of these lower valent vanadium centers was proposed to enhance the selectivity to MA. However, it was not taken into 226 R.A. Overbeek et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) 209-230 account that the presence of Fe2+ also can introduce a less reactive oxygen species. The observed effect can therefore easily be explained by a combined effect of a lower amount of reactive oxygen species and a lower activity of the reactive surface oxygen species. We, however, prepared titania-supported cata- lysts from a lower valent vanadium species resulting in catalysts having an AV between four and five. Since, we observed that similar activities and selectivities were obtained, not only the presence of Fe2+ causes the described effect. Fig. 10 shows a typical product distribution obtained with the selective oxidation of n-butane over a titania-supported V-P-O catalyst with a loading of 2.9 wt.-% vanadium and a P/V ratio of 2.0. Variations of the average valence installed during preparation of vanadium up to an AV of four did not result in a different performance. The major by-product of the reaction was CO; the selectivity to MA seemed to be connected to the production of CO2. The selectivity to MA clearly increased at low conversions, which is in agreement with the results obtained by Martinez-Lara et al. [14]. We, however, found that the selectivity still increased at conversions lower than 20%, whereas, in their case it declined at low conversions. This difference may be attributed to the presence of Fez+ in the catalyst. Also, the above authors used a lower space velocity. We have found the space velocity to influence the selectivity to MA. Typically, maximal MA yields obtained with our catalysts ranged from 10-18 tool-%. Selectivities to MA at low conversions increased up to values of around 50%. Results of the activity tests in a fixed-bed reactor for catalysts of different P/V ratios are represented in Fig. 11. It is shown that the activity in the oxidation of n-butane is only slightly affected by the P/V ratio. The higher the P/V ratio, the lower the activity. However, the decrease in activity due to the rising P/V ratio is small compared to the decrease in activity of catalysts of a higher vanadium loading. Moreover, we found that the selectivity is also only slightly affected by the P/V ratio. The catalyst with an installed P/V ratio of 1.0 showed the highest selectivity. It is possible that this P/V ratio gives rise to an optimal performance of the catalyst in the selective oxidation of n-butane to MA. An optimum of slightly above unity is reported in literature for industrially applied bulk V-P-O catalysts [24]. Comparing the performance of the sup- ported catalysts with that of the industrially applied catalysts, it is evident that the supported catalysts are more active. The higher activity may be caused by the larger reactive surface area of the supported catalysts, but more probably by the increased redox capabilities of the applied V-P-O phase due to the strong interaction with the support. However, since the supported catalysts have a low selectivity to MA at high conversion levels, they seem as yet not to be a promising alternative for the current industrial catalysts which are used in fixed-bed processes. The major by-product at high conversion levels is CO, the production of which decreases at dropping conversion levels. Since, the selectivity to MA at low conversion levels is fairly high (> 50%), R.A.

Conversion as a function of temperature (top) and selectivity to MA as a function of conversion (bottom) for titania-supported V-P-O catalysts as a function of the P/V ratio (2.9 wt.-% vanadium loading). further research aimed at raising the performance is meaningful. The high activity of the catalyst may also contribute to the lower selectivity, since, at high conversions the concentration of n-butane in the reactant gases is relatively low, causing the product MA to react at the available sites. The reaction leads to an increased contribution of the sequential oxidation to CO2 and CO. An experi- ment was, therefore, performed in which at a constant temperature of 360 the space velocity was varied. It was found that the amount of produced MA increased from 11.7 to 12.5 wt.-% if the space velocity was increased from 2000 228 R.A. Overbeek et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) 209-230 to 2500 h-J, although the level of conversion decreased from 90% to 83%. However, when the space velocity was increased to even higher values, the MA production decreased also. This effect can probably be attributed to diffusion limitation: internal diffusion limitation of MA in too narrow pores, or external diffusion limitation in the catalyst bed. We found that an effect of external transport limitation was not present. Since, the pores of the support are, nevertheless, relatively narrow, an increase of the pore diameter could have a positive effect on the catalytic performance. A more significant effect could have the promotion with, e.g., Fe2+, which has already been mentioned in literature [14]. However, further study on the effects of other promoters mentioned in literature, such as Zr, Co, Zn, Mo, Cd, Ni, Mg, Li, La, Ce, W, U, Cr, Cu, In, Ta, Sb and B, would be worthwhile too [25,26]. The length of the above summarized list of promoters already implies the problem which has been encountered during the study on the promotional effects of the different elements. It remains unclear whether the promoters play a role in the build-up of the V-P-O bulk structure or whether they play a role in the catalytic reaction path at the surface of the catalyst. However, as one can deduce from the synthesis procedure, which is precipitation of bulk units from a refluxing solution, it is unclear where the promoter ends up in the catalyst structure. With the newly developed very well dispersed titania-supported V-P-O catalyst described in this study, it is possible to investigate the effects of different added metals or metal ions in a more fundamental way. 4. Conclusions Using a newly developed preparation procedure, very well dispersed titania- supported vanadium-phosphorus-oxide (V-P-O) catalysts have been prepared, exhibiting very intriguing properties in the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride. It has been found, with different characterization techniques, that a vanadium-phosphorus-oxide phase is very well dispersed covering the support surface. From diffuse reflectance Fourier transform spectroscopy results, it was concluded that the applied V-P-O phase has a very strong interaction with the titania support. XRD revealed that crystalline V-P-O modifications were absent. TEM combined with energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX) demonstrated that the precipitated V-P-O phase was very well dispersed anchored to the surface of the support bodies. XPS confirmed these results and showed that the dispersion had increased during exposure to a n-butane/air mixture. The dispersion was not affected by the initial valence state of vana- dium. With XPS, it was established that the surface of the applied V-P-O phase was enriched with phosphate. With EDAX, a ratio was measured equal to the installed P/V proportion. The prepared catalysts already show activity at temperatures of 200, which R.A. Overbeek et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) 209-230 229 is at an remarkably lower temperature (lower than 100!), than exhibited by industrially applied unsupported catalysts. The higher activity is due to a higher number as well as a higher activity of active sites brought about by the strong interaction of the active phase with the support. This higher activity is related with an 'induced reducibility' of the titania support, i.e., an availability of additional, highly active, oxygen atoms bonded to vanadium which are shared with the titania surface. This V-O-Ti interaction, also, has an effect on the on-set of the reduction: the on-set of the reduction shifted to higher temperature when the loading was increased. The availability of extra highly active oxygen atoms was related with the quantity of bare edges of the active V-P-O phase with the support material. The activity as well as the selectivity in the oxidation of n-butane are only slightly affected by the P/V ratio. The higher the P/V ratio, the lower the activity, while the selectivity tends to go through an optimum around a P/V ratio of 1. Since, the titania-supported catalysts have a low selectivity to MA at high conversion levels, they seem not to be useful industrially in fixed-bed processes. The major by-product at high conversion levels is CO, which yield decreases at decreasing conversion levels. Since the selectivity to MA at low conversion levels is fairly high ( > 50%), more research aiming at an improved performance seems meaningful. A more significant effect could have the promotion with metals or metal-ions. It is also possible to use a support material which is less strongly interacting with the applied active phase, such as silica, since, the interaction has a remarkable effect on the performance of the supported V-P-O catalysts.

Titania-supported vanadium-phosphorus oxide catalysts were prepared via deposition-precipitation from a homogeneous solution of lower valent vanadium ions in combination with phosphate-ions onto titania support bodies. From the results of different characterization techniques, it was concluded that the precipitated vanadium-phosphorus oxide phase was amorphous and that it was very well dispersed over the surface of the support. Also, it was found that the active phase exhibited a very strong interaction with the titania support. The prepared catalysts already showed activity at remarkably lower temperatures than industrially utilized catalysts. However, the selectivity at high conversions was small. The performance of the catalyst was found to be related to the reducibility of the active phase. For this system, an enhanced reducibility was detected due to the strong interaction of the active phase with the titania support, which was proved to be a function of the vanadium loading. The activity and selectivity in the oxidation of n-butane were only slightly affected by the installed P V ratio.
