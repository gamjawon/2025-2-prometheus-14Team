(Received September 24, 1992; accepted December 22, 1992 ) Abstract A new chiral ligand, meso-tetrafenchylidenylmethylporphyrin, as well as the corresponding manganese (III)porphyrin have been synthesized. The first results on the catalytic asymetric epoxidation of styrenes and of unfunctionalized aliphatic alkenes, using sodium hypochlorite as oxygen source, are reported. Keywords: alkenes; asymmetric epoxidation; chiral induction; manganese; porphyrin ligands Introduction It is now well documented that synthetic metalloporphyrins are good models for cytochrome P-450 as an oxygen transfer enzyme catalyzing various hydrocarbon oxidation reactions [ 1 ] .Among these, the asymmetric epoxidation of alkenes is of particular relevance to synthetic organic chemistry, and valuable results have been reported on the use of chiral metalloporphyrins as catalysts for this conversion [ 2 ] . Nevertheless, the extreme difficulty of the stereochemical control in the case of simple alkenes makes it desirable to construct new catalytic systems. We report herein our preliminary findings on one such new catalyst. Results and discussion Recently, we worked out a versatile new method for the synthesis of mesotetravinylporphyrins [3a,b ] based on the solvent dependent and highly regioselective reactions of 1-selenoallyl carbenium ion type species with pyrroles [ 3c ] . This method allows for the introduction of chiral fragments in the meso *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved. 396 G. Proess and L.

Catal. 80 (1993) 395-401 positions of the porphyrin nucleus as long as the a,ss-unsaturated selenoacetal required for the generation of the appropriate 1-selenoallyl cation is available. We decided to use the fenchylidene moiety as chiral fragment, and the synthesis of the chloromanganese(III)porphyrin 5 is outlined in Scheme 1. Fenchylidenacetaldehyde 2 (itself prepared from 1 and S- (+ )-fenchone in reasonable yield by the method of Corey [4]) is transformed into the desired selenoacetal 3 on reaction with borontrimethylselenide [5] which in turn is converted into porphyrin 4 in 20% yield. Metallation of 4 occurs quantitatively in the presence of MnC12-4H20 and in refluxing dimethylformamide (DMF). Olefin epoxidations using 5 as the catalyst and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCI) as oxygen source have been carried out essentially in conformity with described procedures [6 ] . For example, oxidation of styrene in the biphasic system dichloromethane-aqueous sodium hypochlorite in the presence of 5 as N=,~S'Me3 i - iii - 17k - 0 2 50% Ia/20_+ 160.4 (1.47 gr/ 100 ml CHC13) -. ~N~ ci~ N--- Mn i .. iv vi SeMe SeMe 3 70% 1a1p0 =+ 50.5 (1.53 gr/100 ml CH=CI_) N N H H N, 4 207 1 a1,~0 =+375.5 (0.2 gr/100 ml CH,('],) N Scheme 1.

When o-chlorostyrene was oxidized under similar conditions, a nearly 1:1 mixture of the corresponding epogide and of o-chlorobenzaldehyde was formed, but the catalyst was not destroyed at the end of the reaction. The recovered catalyst 5 was able to convert completely a second batch of o-chlorostyrene ( 2 mM) into oxidation products without complete decomposition. This means that a turnover number of >_ 1.000 could be reached, which is rather unique with this type of catalyst system. We have also examined the epogidation of a few aliphatic alkenes, and the most important results are shown in Table 1. Several interesting observations have been made in the course of these preliminary experiments. Table 1 shows that the reaction times are usually long, i.e. the epogidation reactions are very slow. This is because we chose to effect them at pH 13 where porphyrin 5 is the most stable. When the pH of the reaction mixtures was adjusted to 9.5 or 10.5 with solid NaHC03 the epogidations were greatly accelerated, but catalyst 5 also decomposed rapidly. Also, when the catalyst was added in several batches, we observed that the first portion decomposed faster than the second or third ones. The reason for this is not clear at present. Although the styrenes were oxidized in high chemical yield, the products TABLE 1 Porphyrin 5 catalyzed epoxidation of olefins N.OCC I 5 / POdRe' CH_CI_-H_O/RT Entry Olefin Reaction time (h) Yield ( % ) ee (%) Turnover in epoxide 1 styrene 40+40b 78 (209 10 195 2 o-chlorostyrene 60 50 (46)9 12 ? 1.000 3 1-dodecene 48+84+48+24 64 10 64 4 1-dodecene 48d 6.3 16 32 5 2-methyl-l-undecene 14+288+60' 9.3 - 133 6 traps-2-octene 21 days 24 - 120 7 traps-4-decene 48 + 168 + 2ss8f 80 (10 )'' - 160 a0lefin:5: NaOCl:pyridine ratio employed 1:0.002:5:0.25. bA second portion of 2 X 10-3 mM of 5 added after 40 h reaction. `Altogether 1 mol% 5 added in four portions: after 0, 48, 84 and 48 h reaction times. dImidazole was used as ligand instead of pyridine.

Catal. 80 (1993) 395-401 included important quantities of the corresponding benzaldehydes; formation of the phenylacetaldehydes was not observed (Table 1, entries 1, 2). We have not yet investigated the ways in which these undesired reactions might be limited or suppressed. It is somewhat unfortunate that the highest turnover number corresponds to the reaction in which the largest amount of undesired benzaldehyde is formed (Table 1, entry 2). Catalytic asymmetric induction is probably the most important aspect of these metalloporphyrin mediated epoxidations. Although the enantiomeric excesses (ee) are rather low, we feel the results obtained for 1-dodecene are most promising because they allow much higher inductions for simple unfunctionalized aliphatic alkenes. Such possibilities are of particular importance in light of the powerful Sharpless' method of asymmetric epoxidation [ 7 ] which, nevertheless, requires the presence of an alcohol functionality in the allylic position. It should be noted, that even though 5 is a chiral substance, most likely it is a mixture of several geometrical and atropisomers. Since the various atropisomers of the same metalloporphyrin may greatly differ in their catalytic efficiencies [8], it seems probable that the atropisomers of 5 will also do so. Moreover, it is conceivable that the isomer which is the best epoxidation catalyst (i.e. the one giving the highest rate) is not necessarily the one leading to the highest asymmetric induction. It is hoped therefore that separation of the isomers of 5 will allow to find the most efficient catalyst. Higher asymmetric inductions should also be possible by changing the chiral fragment in 5, which appears feasible on account of the known flexibility of our synthetic methodology [3 ] (Scheme 1). Work is continuing along these lines. Experimental Commercial chemicals and solvents were purchased from Janssen Chimica, Meck-Belgolabo and Aldrich (Belgium). They were usually purified before use. Diethyl ether and THF were distilled from sodium-benzophenone, chloroform and dichloromethane from phosphorus pentoxide, dimethylformamide from calcium hydride under reduced pressure (20 Torr). UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a Cary 219 instrument, and FAB-MS spectra were obtained on a Finnigan MAT TSQ-70, cannon FAB-ION TECH spectrometer using m-nitrobenzylalcohol as matrix. Syntheses (S)-Fenchylidenacetaldehyde 2 A solution of 6.161 g (61 mM) diisopropylamine in 50 ml THF at 0 C under argon was treated with n-butyllithium (61 mM) for 10 min. 2-Trimethylsilyl-t-butylacetaldimine (10.26 g, 60 mM) dissolved in 5 ml THF was slowly (1 h) added by means of a pump-syringe. The resulting red solution was stirred G. Proess and L. Heuesi/J. Mol. Catal. 80 (1993) 395-401 399 for an additional 0.5 h at 0 C and cooled to - 78 C, then 9.12 g (60 mM) of (S) - ( + ) -fenchone was injected as a solution in 20 ml THF. The mixture was stirred for 2.5 h at - 20 C, and for 8 h at 20 C. Water (100 ml) was added and the pH was adjusted to 4.5 with solid oxalic acid. The yellow-orange solution was stirred for 0.5 h, extracted with ether, washed with a saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and with brine. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and evaporated, to give 14 g of crude product as an orange-red liquid containing, by GC analysis, besides fenchone, two isomers of 2 in a ratio of 70:30. Column chromatographic purification (neutral Si02, eluent pentane: ether 97:3) gave 5.35 g (50% yield) of the mixture of isomers of 2 as a yellow liquid. Anal.

The presence of two isomers is shown by five methyl singlets in the 1-2 ppm region (at 8=1.66; 1.45; 1.35; 1.25 and 1.17 ppm), and by a small splitting (0.05 ppm) of the olefinic and aldehydic doublets.

The reaction mixture was quenched with 2 ml of saturated sodium hydroxide and extracted with ether. The organic phase was washed with water, dried and concentrated.

A solution (DMF, 10 ml) of selenoacetal 3 (0.350 g,1 mM) and freshly distilled pyrrole (0.067 g,1 mM) was rapidly injected, and the resulting dark red solution was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. 2,3-Dichlorodicyanoquinone (DDQ, 0.227 g,1 mM) was added and stirring was continued for 0.5 h. The reaction mixture was poured into 200 ml of water and filtered. The 400 G. Proess and L. Hevesi/J. Mot. Catal. 80 (1993) 395-401 resulting black precipitate was redissolved in 100 ml of dichloromethane and dried over magnesium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent gave 0.324 g of black solid which was purified by column chromatography (neutral Si02, eluent dichloromethane) to give 0.044 g (20% yield) of porphyrin 4 as a violet solid. The latter was quantitatively metallated using a 40% excess of MnC12-4H20 by refluging for 3 h in 10 ml of DMF. The reaction mixture, cooled to room temperature, was diluted with 100 ml of ethyl acetate, washed four times with 20 ml portions of water, dried and evaporated to give pure 5 as a purple-black solid.

Epoxidation of styrene A mixture of 204 mg (2 mM) of styrene, 4 mg (4X10-3 MM) of chloromanganese (III) porphyrin 5 and 20 mg (0.25 mM) of pyridine were dissolved in 5 ml of dichloromethane. To this solution was added 5 ml of a 2 M freshly prepared aqueous NaOCI solution and the two-phase mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature. The progress of the reaction was monitored by gas chromatography (20 m SE-30 LL capillary column): after 40 h the characteristic green colour of 5 changed to light brown, and the reaction mixture contained 65% styrene, 22% styrene oxide, and 13% benzaldehyde. A second portion of 4 mg of 5 was added, and the mixture was stirred for another 40 h (altogether 80 h reaction time), when the conversion was nearly complete: 1.3% styrene, 79% styrene oxide, 20% benzaldehyde. Dichloromethane extraction and purification (PLC, neutral Si02, eluent ether: pentane, 1: 9) gave 188 mg (78% yield, overall turnover 195) of styrene oxide whose 1H NMR analysis using europium (hfc)3 as shift reagent showed a modest but distinct asymmetric induction of 10% ee.
