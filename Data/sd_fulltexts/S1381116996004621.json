Previously obtained experimental results are briefly reviewed together with presentation of complementary results. The results are generalized in the assumptions of the model. Two steps of activation of the Co foil are distinguished: (1) formation of potential centers as referred to surface development during redox pretreatment, (2) transformation of potential centers into active centers via autocatalytic reduction by hydrogen contained in the methanation mixture. A good fit to the kinetic results and agreement with available experimental facts verify the validity of the model. 997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction Heterogeneous catalysts require pretreatment in order to be transformed from a nearly inert state to an active one, thus meaning that the catalyst precursors have to be activated. However, they lose such an activity during their work in a catalytic reactor, that is to say, the catalysts undergo deactivation with time-onstream (TOS). Hence, the active state is a specific, and unstable, state of a material called catalyst. Changes in catalyst activity can be formally described by a commonly used performance Corresponding author.

PII 51381-1 169(96)00462-1 equation [ 1 ] but without any further insight into the nature of activation and deactivation processes. Another possible way of investigating the problem consists in considering variable numbers of active centers in a given catalytic system [2]. The catalytic reaction proceeds only on the specific sites of the catalyst surface - called active centers. As soon as the population of these centers changes, the reaction rate also changes, provided that the turn-over frequency (TOF) on an active center is a specific constant value. Hence, observed continuous variation in the reaction rate (in stationary systems) can be interpreted as the variation of the number of active centers. Alternatively, it could be assumed that the 2 J. fojewska, R. Dziembaj/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 122 (1997) 1-11 number of active centers is constant [3], and all changes in the rate of catalytic reaction are due to the changes in TOF. However, such a model, explaining continuous changes in the catalytic reaction rate, based on continuous changes in TOF, has not yet been applied. The present paper intends (i) to propose a model of activation (based on a variable number of active centers and a constant TOF) in a definite catalytic system, and (ii) to verify assumptions in the model by appropriate kinetic and complementary experiments. Methanation of C02 on the preoxidized cobalt foils has been chosen as a convenient model system. The model consideration presented in this paper is a contribution to the study on the activation and deactivation of cobalt foil in C02 methanation, done in close cooperation with Prof. G. Wedler et al. from the University of Erlangen. Since deactivation has been found to be not a single process but comprised of several processes combined together, model consideration on deactivation requires justification based on experimental results distinguishing various reasons for the deactivation. The detailed description will be presented in a separate paper 2: Experimental characterization of the activation processes It has been known from studies by Amariglio et al. [5-8] that the initial activity (just after preoxidation) during methanation of C02 is about thousand times higher than the activity of an untreated foil. Amariglio et al., however, did not propose any consistent model of the cobalt foil activation, though he suggested that oxygen atoms promote its methanation activity in some unrecognized way. This inspired us to investigate the problem further and was a starting point to formulate first hypothetical models of activation. The initial approach to modelling enabled us to put several questions necessary to complete a set of consistent assumptions of the model. Consequently, to achieve this, a new characterization of the catalytic system has been performed in cooperation with Prof. G. Wedler. The most essential results of this study, which contribute to the experimental basis of the model, were included in the previous paper in series [9]. They, and some others, will be reviewed briefly, and then, the new and relevant facts will be introduced along with a short description of the experimental set-up and procedure. 2.1. Review of known facts The tremendous increase in methanation activity after preoxidation of Co foils was confirmed [ 10], and moreover, additional sigmoidal increase in the activity was observed by us in thorough measurements of kinetics of C02 hydrogenation [ 11 ] - especially those done in a short TOS range [9,12]. The methanation activity was observed to be enhanced by either increasing the partial pressure of oxygen during preoxidation or by increasing the oxidation temperature. The knowledge of the nature of cobalt activation has been enriched by characterization of both cobalt monocrystals [13-16] and polycrystalline cobalt [9,16,17]. It has been found that the reduction is limited only to the surface layers [9,17], unlike oxidation which can reach far, deep layers in the cobalt bulk [9,15,17,18]. This was evidenced by depth profiling with Auger electron spectroscopy and electron microscopy [9,18], and, additionally, by the temperature-programmed reduction and oxidation experiments [9,17]. Furthermore, repetition of redox cycles, applied as a pretreatment of the cobalt foil, causes an increase in the number of labile oxygen atoms (removable in the subsequent reduction step) up to the saturation value, observed after about 10 redox cycles [9,17]. A complementary increase of the maximum catalytic activity has been observed, up to a very J. Lojewska, R. Dziembaj/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 122 (1997) 1-11 reproducible value [9,12]. This maximum activity is about 104 times higher than the activity of a well-reduced cobalt foil. 2.2. New facts 2.2.1. Experimental The apparatus used in kinetic studies allows to carry out experiments in continuous flow of reactants. It comprises a gas supplying system, reactor and gas analyzing system. The gas supplying system consists of a hydrogen generator (Packard), flasks with N2 - technical with 3200 PPM of 02 (POCh), standard C02 and He (POCK), gas purifiers (Supelco), electronic flow controllers (ERG-100), and four- or six-port valves (Supelco). Characterization of the reactor type by the residence-time distribution of a tracer (CH4 in He flow) allowed to classify it as a plug-flow reactor [ 12,19]. The reactor is equipped with a programmable heating device: oven, thermocouples and temperature programmer (Chinotherm l0A). The gas analyzing system is built of two alternatively working detectors (Chrom-5) fixed directly to the reactor outlet: a flame ionization detector applied during hydrogenation of C02 for continuous measurement of methane in the reactor outlet (the contribution of higher hydrocarbons in products of C02 hydrogenation was always less than 1 %); a thermal conductivity detector applied in temperature-programmed reduction and oxidation. The sample of catalyst used in all types of experiments presented in this paper, was a cobalt foil (Goodfellow, 99,9%, 0.05 mm thick, about 1.1 cm2 of total geometrical area cut into 8 pieces). Prior the routine catalytical tests the initial sample of the foil was pretreated by a series of 10 redox cycles in order to obtain a reproducible activity in the methanation of C02. The parameters of reduction and oxidation were the same as during the standard pretreatment (see below). 3 The procedure of all isothermic kinetic tests consisted of the following steps: the redox pretreatment: prereduction in H 2 30 ml/min for 1 h at 873 K, and preoxida- tion in N2 containing 3200 ppm 02, 30 ml/min for 30 min at 873 K; catalytical C02 methanation performed at 573 K (also 473, 523, 623 K), in H2:C02 = 4:1 with a flow rate 50 ml/min. The experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure. The values of flow rates refer to 101300 Pa and 293 K. The described conditions of C02 methanation will be called the standard conditions of the methanation or simply the standard methanation in the whole paper (unless specified differently). Temperature-programmed reduction (TPRed) was carried out in H2 (flow rate 50 ml/min with a rate of temperature increase of 10 K/min) on the catalyst oxidized at the same conditions as those given above. The preliminary characterization of the microreactor by the tracer time distribution provided determination of the response time, i.e. the period between the switching on the valve and getting the detector response, amounting 30 s for a total flow F = 50 ml/min. This was taken into account in establishing the `zero time' for kinetic curves obtained during catalytic tests. 2.2.2. Results After presentation of the known facts, the last question to be considered is: What process is responsible for increasing the activity of the catalyst in the initial period of C02 methanation? In order to answer it, the foil was tested by the catalytical reaction at its two different redox states. Curve a in Fig. 1 represents the typical result of the standard methanation at 573 K, i.e. when the catalyst at the oxidized state was exposed to the reaction mixture. In contrast, curve b corresponds to the analogous experiment in which the catalyst after usual preoxidation was reduced in H2/He (4:1, 50 ml/min) at 573 K for 15 min, prior the standard methana- 4 J.

Since in this case the initial sigmoidal growth of the activity does not appear, it is obvious that the catalyst in the reduced state of the surface is active, and reduction is the reason for the growth in activity. The total amount of water which can be evaluated during reduction, estimated from TPRed (e.g. Fig. 2), and being the measure of reducible cobalt canons, amounts to 41 /Cmol/cm2. Kinetics of the activation depends on temperature.

For instance, at 473 K, it lasted about 2 h but the activity was at the lowest limit of the detector sensitivity, and, at 623 K, it lasted only 3 min. The set of kinetic curves obtained at various temperatures is presented in Fig. 3. The inset in Fig. 3 shows the experiment carried out at 473 K in enlarged coordinates. 3. Model presentation 2. Two types of centers are distinguished: 1. Potential centers ( ), defined as cobalt cations in the surface layers, which can be reduced by hydrogen at the standard conditions. Active centers ( *), defined as clusters of cobalt atoms, formed on the catalyst surface from the reduced cobalt cations. A sequence of the reduction and oxidation pretreatment (the redox cycles) causes a stepby-step increase in the number of potential centers. It can be explained as follows. Oxidation of a metal domain in the fresh cobalt foil results in formation of many oxide nuclei which grow into oxide subgrains. These subgrains are reduced superficially in the next reduction step. Apparently, the following oxidation step has to form even smaller oxide subgrains, and so on. J. Lojewska, R. Dziembaj /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 122 (1997) 1-11 SURFACE REDUCTION a redox cycle, active catalyst -co 'h- C -coo w,.- Fig. 4. Scheme of development of the surface of Co foil in subsequent redox cycles. Thus, the initial cobalt grain is divided into many smaller sub-subgrains which are bound loosely in the total grain. Such a material has a larger specific surface and a high cobalt dispersion (Fig. 4) manifested in SEM micrographs 191. Preliminary activation of cobalt in the redox cycles leads to the development of its surface, and, as a consequence, to an increase in the number of the potential centers. The concentration of these centers depends on 4 parameters: temperature of oxidation, pressure of oxygen, times of oxidation and reduction, and number of redox cycles. Usually, after 10 cycles at the standard conditions of the reaction, the number of potential centers on the surface of so prepared catalyst reaches the maximum value, No. Admission of a hydrogen-containing reaction mixture into the reactor causes proper activation, e. transformation of the potential ( ) centers into active ( * ) ones. It is the reason for increase of the methanation rate during the first minutes of the catalytic methanation (curve a in Fig. 1). Reduction of the totally oxidized catalyst by molecular hydrogen must be a very slow reaction determined by the rate constant kta of formation of a water precursor (see the scheme in Fig. 5). However, appearance of reduced 5 cobalt atoms enables fast dissociative adsorption of hydrogen molecules characterized by an equilibrium constant, KH2. There is experimental evidence, e.g. [20,21], that HZ is dissociatively chemisorbed on cobalt films or monocrystals. Surface species, H * , react easily with surface oxide forming water precursors with a rate constant kt,. Hence, the transformation of the potential centers into active ones can be described by the formalism of the autocatalytic reaction. This implies that there are two types of reduction of the surface cobalt oxide: (1) reduction by molecular hydrogen ( non-catalyzed), (2) reduction by atomic surface hydrogen ( catalyzed). Formation of water precursors ( rla) must be a rate determining step of the non-catalyzed reduction (RDS act). This is simply a precondition for the proper activation. Moreover, the commonly approved model of COZ methanation, proposed by [22-24], has been included in the model consideration. It is based on dissociation of CO2, and formation of carbon species which are subsequently hydrogenated to methane precursors, arbitrarily denoted by CH Z * in Fig. 5. At the standard conditions of the reaction, hydrogenation of methane precursors is a rate determining step for the overall reaction. For the sake of convenience, hydrogenation of CH 2 * has been chosen as a representative rate determining step (RDS met) in further calculations.

Mechanism of activation based on the autocatalytical reduction of potential centers. 6 J. Lojewska, R. Dziembaj / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 122 (l) 1-11 In accordance with our experimental data, the overall rate constant for the methanation (k.) is much higher than the overall rate constant for activation (ka, ,t). If it were opposite, we would have observed an initial increase of the methanation rate also in Fig. lb, where the catalyst was reduced just before admission of the reaction mixture. No such a behavior was noticed, which means that the quasi-steady state of the methanation is reached much faster than it can be measured (in our case the data collecting frequency was 0.5 s -1). In other words, while the population of active centers grows, methanation runs through the continuity of its steady states. Different widths of arrows, in Fig. 5, correspond to the differences in specific rates of the partial reactions. It should be added that the model of catalyst activation is limited to the period of time-onstream up to the maximum concentration of active centers (N.), 0 < TOS < t., and temperature below 630 K. At these conditions, the rate of catalyst deactivation (rd, J is negligible in comparison with both rates of methanation (rm) and activation (ra,;t). 4. Model formalism 4.1.

The examples of verification tests are presented in Fig. 6 a-d. The results of the function fitting ( ) to the experimental data ( ~ ~ ~ ) are very good. The standard deviation related to the values of the predicted function stays at about 1 %, except for 623 K at which it is equal to 3%. The correlation coefficient decreases with (4) temperature from, on average, 0.9998 at 473 K to 0.9995 at 623 K. The highest deviation be tween experimental data and the predicted func tion occurs in the beginning of activation at 623 K (see Fig. 6d). The lowest sensitivity of the FID was used at this temperature, due to the relatively high signal of methane at the maxi mum. For this reason, small initial values of the rate of methane formation have the largest ex perimental error (as well as the lowest number of points), thus influencing the quality of fitting at higher temperature. The parameter optimization provided determination of four parameters of the model presented in Fig. 7: (7) 5. Model verification and discussion Nonlinear regression was used so as to fit the model function (Eq. (7)) to the experimental data. The parameters were optimized with the use of the quasi-Newton method or, if it was necessary, the Simplex method available in the commercial package CSS:STATISTICA. The set of data available for verification comprises 8 kinetic curves obtained at different temperatures. The slowest measurable rate of C02 methanation determined the lowest tem perature for the verification, i.e. 473 K. The upper temperature limit is 623 K. At this tem perature, the period of proper activation lasts less than 3 min. As the time of proper activation (t.)prolongs with temperature, and the den sity of points is constant (0.5 s s'), so the number of points belonging to kinetic curves the maximum number of active centers, N.; the rate constants of non-catalyzed, kla, and catalyzed, klc, reduction of potential centers; the inseparable parameter P, the ratio of the rate constant of adsorption of C02 on active centers, k2b, to the equilibrium constant of dissociative adsorption of H2, KH2. The first adjustable parameter, Nm, increases with the temperature of methanation from about 6 fcmol/cm2 at 473 K to 39 tLmol/cm2 at 623 K. The value of Nm. for 623 K is almost equal to the number of reducible cobalt atoms, No(TPRed) obtained from TPRed (see Fig. 2). Apparently, at lower temperature, activation does not lead to complete reduction of the surface Co canons (during TPRed surface reduction completed at about 620 K). In order to determine the extent of activation due to redox cycles we can compare the concentration of active centers at both initial and reproducible states of Co foil. The concentration of Co atoms on the densest [0001 ] plane of Co 8 J. Lojewska, R. Dziembaj/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 122 (1997) 1-11 monocrystal (hcp) related to geometric area will serve as a reference value and a model value of the number of active centers on the ideal cobalt foil. This value amounting to 4.1 - 10-3 1,01/cm2, is four orders of magnitude smaller than the one of the active foil (No(TPRed) and N.). The rate constants of non-catalyzed reduction (kla) and catalyzed reduction (kl,) increase with temperature. The certainty of optimization of both parameters lowers with temperature because divergences between the values of parameters at a given temperature (see Fig. 7) as well as the standard deviations (from optimization) grow with temperature (especially for kj. It seems to be quite plausible that the boundary temperature for the assumption of negligible deactivation is located around 623 K. According to our expectations, as can be independently deduced from the model, the rate constant kl$ is less than klc within the whole 0,15 V 0,10 0,05 12 C 10 uF: g 6 i= 4 2 0 range of the used reaction temperatures. Let us compare the rates calculated from both constants (Eq. (2)) with the number of collisions of H 2 molecules estimated from the theory of the ideal gas (Cn). The maximum rates of noncatalyzed (rla(t~)) and catalyzed (rljt.)) reductions are 8 orders of magnitude lower than Cn. The discussed values and the formulas are given in Table 1. At last, comparison of the activation energies of the non-catalyzed and catalyzed reductions - their estimated values amounting to 106 4 and 28 2 kJ/mol, respectively - gives also a reasonable result. The fit of the Arrhenius equation to both parameters is shown as a solid line in Fig. 7 (correlation coefficients for klc = 0.97, for k1$ = 0.998).

Turn-over frequency (TOF) of methanation ( ); fitting of Arrhenius equation ( ). The model of activation allows to calculate TOF of methanation from the maximum rate of methanation ( rm( tm.)) based on values of Nmax estimated from the model. The results are presented in Fig. 8 along with the values of the activation energy ( Ea) and the preexponential factor ( A). The values of TOF and A can be compared with the summary frequency of collisions of H 2 and COZ with an active center ( Cf). The values of Cf were estimated from the ideal gas theory including the stoichiometry of methanation. They are presented in Table 2. The preexponential factor A is 2 orders of magnitude lower than the summary frequency Cf, which appears to be quite convincing. Certainly, TOF is around 7 orders of magnitude lower than Cf.

After initial increase with temperature, s seems to stabilize at around 0.06. As mentioned before, the model is limited to the cases when deactivation of the catalyst is negligible. This assumption is fulfilled within the period of continuous increase of the catalytic activity. However, the influence of deactivation on the methanation rate grows in the vicinity of the maximum activity. Although, as observed in TPR [4,9], sintering was noticeable at temperatures higher than 630 K; it could interfere with activation at 623 K, which in turn could influence the values of the model parameters at this temperature. The problems concerning the catalyst deactivation have been described in the previous paper [9]. Complementary results and a model of deactivation will be presented in the next paper [4]. 6.

Previously obtained experimental results are briefly reviewed together with presentation of complementary results. The results are generalized in the assumptions of the model. Two steps of activation of the Co foil are distinguished: (1) formation of potential centers as referred to surface development during redox pretreatment, (2) transformation of potential centers into active centers via autocatalytic reduction by hydrogen contained in the methanation mixture. A good fit to the kinetic results and agreement with available experimental facts verify the validity of the model. Keywords Activation model Cobalt catalyst CO2 methanation References [1] O.
