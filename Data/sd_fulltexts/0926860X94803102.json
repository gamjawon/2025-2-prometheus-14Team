In the MAT experiment USY gives a lower cumulative average conversion, its intrinsic activity is higher, but it decays much faster than SAPO-37. This behavior is discussed on the basis of acidity distribution in the catalysts. Because of the differences in hydrogen transfer activity, the order of cracking for USY and SAPO-37 is different, too. Simulation results indicate that, in a commercial FCC unit, a higher conversion should be expected for USY, as long as the contact time is < 3.

Introduction The new environmental regulations on automotive fuels that are being established in many countries, lead refiners to accommodate their strategies to provide the required gasoline composition [ 1 ]. One of the main gasoline production units is the FCC and consequently it has a strong impact in the composition of the final gasoline pool. From the point of view of reformulated gasoline, the naphtha pro- duced by the FCC contains too much alkenes and sulfur, while its octane number is lower than desired. However, the FCC unit can become an important unit to produce highly valued isobutene and isoamylenes, which are used for preparing MTBE and TAME oxygenates, respectively. The gasoline production and quality can be modified in the FCC by an adequate control of feed selection, reactor conditions and catalysts. In general, it is not always possible to select the most adequate feed, and refiners have to accommodate their * Corresponding author. E-mail itq@upvnet.upv.es, tel. ( + 34-6) 3877800, fax.

Martfnez- Triguero /Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) 153-162 units to receive a large variety of feeds. As concerns the reactor conditions, the most important process variables are: reaction temperature, regenerator bed tem- perature, carbon on regenerated catalyst, oil partial pressure, oil contact time, recycle ratio, and process steam [ 2-5 ]. A careful adjustment of these variables can improve the gasoline quality. How- ever, it is difficult to produce the required improvements in a selective way from only changes in reaction conditions. It is for this reason that major changes in the product distribution are associated with differences in catalyst activity and selec- tivity. Then, it is of great interest for FCC catalyst manufacturers, as well as for refiners, to be able to compare efficiently and economically the cracking behavior of different catalyst preparations. This is usually done by means of MAT units which operate in a fixed bed reactor and have been normally working at times-on- stream (TOS) in the range of 30 to 75 s, various catalyst to oil ratios and reactor temperatures in the 480-530 range. This methodology has been successfully used when comparing series of catalysts in which the activity-decay behavior did not differ much [6]. However it can be easily understood that, owing to the very fast catalyst deac- tivation occurring during cracking which can strongly reduce the activity of the catalyst within a few seconds of time-on-stream, it becomes necessary to discuss the possibilities and limitations of this technique when catalysts that are very different in nature have to be tested. In this work we have studied the gasoil cracking behavior of two materials, i.e. a USY and a SAPO-37, which while having the same structure are different in chemical composition, and are expected to behave quite differently in gasoil crack- ing [7-9]. An automated MAT unit was used to carry out the work, and a series of experiments at different TOS and different cat/oil ratios were performed on each catalyst. Their behavior was compared on the bases of cumulative average conver- sion, instantaneous conversion, and kinetic and decay parameters. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials A SAPO-37 sample with a chemical composition given by [ Si0.17A10.47Po.36] 02 and having 33 Si/u.c. was synthesized following the procedure described in ref. [ 10]. Taking into account the proportion of the different mechanisms (SN2 and SN3) for Si substitution found for this sample [ 11], the expected number of BrOnsted acid sites would be lower than a USY zeolite with equivalent number of A1/u.c. For this reason, a USY sample with 21 Al/u.c. was also prepared. The USY zeolite was obtained by steam calcination, at atmospheric pressure and 923 K for 3 h, of a partially ammonium exchanged NaY zeolite ( SK-40 from Union Carbide). After steaming the sample was again exchanged twice and finally calcined at 773 A. Corma, J.

In this way, a USY sample with a unit cell size of 2.442 nm and 90% crystallinity (referred to the original NaY zeolite) was obtained. The sodium content of the final catalyst was seen to be 0.15 wt.-% as Na20. IR spectroscopic measurements were carried out on a Nicolet 710 Fourier trans- form infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer equipped with data station. Wafers of 10 mg cm- 2 were introduced into a conventional greaseless IR cell and pretreated over- night in vacuum at 673 K and 873 K for USY and SAPO-37 samples, respectively. The acidity of the catalysts was measured by pyridine adsorption and desorption at increasing temperatures and vacuum. 2.2. Reaction procedure The gasoil cracking reactions were performed in an automated MAT unit able to carry out several cycles of reaction-regeneration experiments. Reaction condi- tions (reaction and regeneration temperatures, TOS, cat/oil ratio, etc.) can be changed from one experiment to another by introducing the corresponding para- meters in the computer before starting a series of runs [ 12]. The catalyst samples were diluted in a silica matrix and activated 'in situ' before the first experiment. Thus, SAPO-37 catalyst was carefully activated following the protocol described in ref. [ 9 ], while USY catalyst was activated at 803 K under an air flow. The gasoil feed was a vacuum gasoil whose physicochemical characteristics are given in Table 1. A reaction temperature of 755 K was used in all the experiments. Different conversion levels were obtained by changing the catalyst-to-oil ratio. Moreover, in order to get reliable kinetic data the time-on-stream was also varied in the range of 5-120 s. After each experiment the catalysts were regenerated 'in situ' by passing 100 ml min-1 of air through the reactor at 803 K for 5 h. Gases were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and separated in two col- umns: hydrogen and stripping nitrogen in a molecular sieve packed column with argon as carrier gas and a thermal conductivity detector.

Conversion is defined here as the sum of gases, gasoline (483 K), diesel (593 K), and coke. 3. Results and discussion The average cumulative conversions obtained on USY and SAPO-37 at 30 and 60 TOS, according to conventional catalyst testing in MAT units, are given in Table 2. From these results one would certainly conclude that SAPO-37 is more active than USY, and indeed this has been reported in the patent literature [7,8]. Thus, if SAPO-37 is more active than USY one would expect the former to have a larger amount of adequate active sites than the latter. However, pyridine adsorption- desorption experiments clearly show that the total number of Br0nsted acid sites is much higher in SAPO-37 than in USY (Fig. 1 ), while the amount of strong acid sites capable of retaining pyridine at higher desorption temperatures is higher in USY. Our acidity distribution results are in agreement with the observation that cracking of n-heptane, which needs strong acid sites, goes better on USY than on SAPO-37 [9]. If one still believes, despite the above arguments, that SAPO-37 is more active for gasoil cracking than USY, he would have to conclude that gasoil cracking does not require strong acid sites and that weak acid sites are sufficient for this purpose. Such a conclusion is not consistent with the actual accepted knowledge. However, it has to be considered that the conversion measured at 30 and 60 TOS results, not only from the catalyst activity, but also from the catalyst deactivation. In order to separate these two factors, we have measured conversions at various TOS (including values at very short TOS) and at different cat/oil ratios (Fig. 2). Our data were fitted to the kinetic three-lump model for gasoil cracking [ 13,14] (Fig. 3), which involves both the kinetics of the cracking process and of the catalyst decay: dXA 1--XA l+W( ---- Ko(~) l+Gt)-N (1) Table 2 Gasoil conversions and product yields on USY and SAPO-37 catalysts at a g.cat/g.oil ratio of 0.211 TOS (s) 23 60 USY SAPO-37 USY SAPO-37 conve rsion (wt.-%) 58.17 72.21 52.29 71.16 Yields Gasoline 31.33 46.31 35.12 44.83 Diese I 10.68 9.84 9.19 10.36 Gases 14.63 13.46 13.60 13.83 Coke 1.53 2.60 1.38 2.14 A.

The statistical parameters given in Table 3 show that the fitting was satisfactory, and that reliable values of the kinetic and decay constants were obtained. Although SAPO-37 gives a higher cumulative average conversion than USY, the kinetic rate and decay constant values indicate that USY is intrinsically more active but it decays faster. The coupling of these two effects results in a higher average cumu- lative conversion on SAPO-37, at least, for TOS > 30. The higher value of the kinetic rate constant for USY is consistent with the commonly accepted idea that gasoil cracks at a larger rate on strong acid sites, and confirms that the amount of the strong acid sites (Fig. 2) is larger in USY than in SAPO-37. Likewise, it can be seen from Table 3 that the refractoriness parameter (W) is different for both catalysts studied. This is in agreement with previous work [ 14], which has showed that this parameter does not only depend on the nature of the feed but also on the nature of the catalyst.

Instantaneous conversions plotted by computer simulation using the kinetic parameters obtained for USY (--) and SAPO-37 (- - -). reactions, such as the ones occurring during gasoil cracking, have a strong effect on the crackeability of \"gasoil being formed and cracked along the catalytic bed\" [ 13]. In our case the easier 'crackeability' on SAPO-37 would be due to its lower hydrogen transfer activity. Thus some of, still, gasoil molecules formed during cracking along the catalyst bed will have olefinic character, and should be easier to crack to give gasoline and gases. The different W values indicate that the order of cracking ( 1 + W) is different on the two catalysts, which implies that it may not A. Corma, J. Martfnez-Triguero /Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) 153-162 161 always be the most appropriate to fix the order of decay in the gasoil cracking models [ 16,17 ]. From the practical point of view of the catalyst testing it is of interest to pose a question about the importance of experiments performed at short time-on-stream for obtaining a most adequate catalyst comparison. In order to tackle this problem, the fitting procedure was repeated after removing the conversion values obtained at 5, then 5 plus 11, and then 5, 11 and 23. Our results (Table 4), prove that the experiments performed at short time-on-stream are necessary to get reliable kinetic and decay parameters. We conclude, that for comparison of new catalytic materials with the USY or REUSY containing catalysts, the cracking experiment should be performed at TOS of less than 30 s, and preferably between 5 and 11 s. Finally, one would like to know which catalyst, SAPO-37 or USY would give a higher conversion in a FCC unit. On the bases of Eq. ( 1 ), we have simulated the instantaneous conversions at different TOS for both catalysts (Table 3, Fig. 4). Our results show that for a reactor operating with a contact time below 3 s the USY catalyst will give a higher conversion, while for longer contact times the SAPO-37 catalyst is preferred. 4. Conclusions On the basis of the kinetic studies of the gasoil cracking on USY and SAPO-37 it has been proved that the average cumulative conversion obtained at TOS > 30 can not be used as the only criterion of the catalyst activity. It is necessary to consider also the kinetic parameters, which show tfiat USY is intrinsically more active than SAPO-37 but the former decays faster. The higher activity of USY is assisted by the higher amount of strong acid sites. However, SAPO-37 has more BrCnsted acid sites in total. The lower hydrogen transfer activity of SAPO-37 [ 9] causes that less refractory products (more olefinic) are cracked, and these are still in the boiling range of gasoil, along the catalytic bed. This results in a lower apparent order for cracking on SAPO-37 than on USY. When FCC catalysts with a very different activity-decay behavior are to be compared in a MAT unit, the experiments should be done at TOS < 10. Finally, it is concluded that in a real FCC unit, USY will give a higher conversion than SAPO-37 only if the unit is run at TOS < 3.

A kinetic study of gasoil cracking has been carried out on USY and SAPO-37 catalysts. In the MAT experiment USY gives a lower cumulative average conversion, its intrinsic activity is higher, but it decays much faster than SAPO-37. This behavior is discussed on the basis of acidity distribution in the catalysts. Because of the differences in hydrogen transfer activity, the order of cracking for USY and SAPO-37 is different, too. Simulation results indicate that, in a commercial FCC unit, a higher conversion should be expected for USY, as long as the contact time is ⩽ 3.
