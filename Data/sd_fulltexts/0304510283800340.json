K. PLUMMER, Jr., S. SHINOZAKI, K. M. ADAMS and H. S. GANDHI Scientific Research Laboratory, Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, MI 48121 (U.S.A.) Summary Preliminary studies comparing the morphology and chemical nature of a Pd/7-Al203 catalyst with a Pd-W/7-Al203 catalyst have been carried out using transmission electron microscopy. Evidence is presented to indicate that the incorporation of a high concentration of tungsten changes the pal- ladium particle characteristics after calcination in air at 500 C and also after reduction in hydrogen at 550 C. When Pd/7-Al203 is calcined in air, small palladium particles (<2 nm) are formed in addition to larger palladium oxide particles (<7 nm). Both types of particles are thin, essentially two-dimensional, resulting in a high surface to volume ratio. On the other hand, the palladium particles formed during reduction contain a narrow size range (ca. 3 -10 nm) with many par- ticles assuming a three-dimensional symmetry, thus providing a lower surface to volume ratio. Pd-W/7-Al203 catalyst, when calcined in air, also produces an essential- ly two-dimensional bimodal particle size distribution, but in this sytem the particles are all metallic palladium with no oxides detected. After heating this specimen in hydrogen, only a small increase in the particle size range, with a slight decrease in the concentration of small particles, was noted indi- cating a strong interaction between particles and substrate. Thus a high pal- ladium surface area is retained in this catalyst. Introduction It has been noted [1] that catalysts containing palladium (Pd) and tungsten (W) may have the potential to substitute for platinum (Pt) and rhodium (Rh) used in current three-way catalysts (TWCs) and conventional oxidation catalysts (COCs). If Pd and W prove to be acceptable replacements for Pt and Rh, their use could decrease substantially the cost of precious metals in current TWCs and COCs. Suitable catalyst formulations containing Pd and W have shown in laboratory pulse flame reactor evaluations initial 0304-5102/83/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 252 hydrocarbon oxidation activity equivalent to Pt-containing catalysts, and nitrogen oxide removal approximating that of Rh-contaming TWCs. It is the intent of this report to discuss information obtained in pre- liminary Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) studies, comparing the chemistry and morphology of 7^1203 supported palladium with tungsten oxide/7-Al203 supported palladium. Experimental procedures 7-Alumina washcoat was applied to two cordierite monoliths (400 square cells in~2, 6 mm wall thickness) by dipping each monolith into a 15 wt.% aqueous dispersion of Catapal 7-A1;;03 powder (Conoco Chemicals), then drying and calcining in air at 600 C for ca. 4 h. The resulting ^-Al^O^ washcoat on monolith contained in one monolith ca. 8% \"/-Al-iO^ and in the second monolith ca. 9% 7-A1203 of the sample weight (as determined by weight gain). One 7-A1203 washcoated monolith was impregnated with Pd by dipping it into acidified (4 vol.% cone. HNO^) aqueous solution of PdCl2 followed by drying and calcining in air at 500 C for ca. 4 h. This specimen contained 0.18% Pd based on total sample weight as analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy. A second 7-A1203 washcoated monolith was impregnated with W prior to impregnation with Pd. It was dipped into a solution containing 17 g of W03-H20 dissolved per 100 cm3 of cone. NHUOH, then dried and calcined in air at 300 C for ca. 4 h. This procedure was repeated until the desired W content (as determined by weight gain) was attained. After Pd impregnation, an XRF analysis showed 0.15% Pd and 4.75% W based on total sample weight. This provides a ratio of7-Al203/W03 = 1.8. To study the effect of reduction on the above specimens, each specimen was heated to 550 C for ca. 4 h in a flowing stream (3.2 dm3 min\"l) of nitrogen containing 1% hydrogen. For the TEM investigation, the washcoat containing the Pd and Pd-W was physically removed from the cordierite monolith and was prepared for observation by the extraction replication procedure described by Yao, Sieg and Plummer [2]. In this procedure the catalyst material is crushed, spread on to glass microscope slides and coated with a layer of evaporated carbon. The composite film is floated on to a 10 vol.% aqueous HF solution to dis- solve the 7^203 and soluble metals, transferred to a distilled water wash, retrieved with microscope specimen grids and dried in air before TEM ob- servation, For comparison with results obtained by HF extraction replica- tion, the hydrogen-reduced Pd/7-Al203 specimen was also prepared by crushing the washcoat under distilled water and spreading the slurry onto freshly cleaved mica. After drying, it was coated with a layer of evaporated carbon followed by floating the carbon film containing particles onto a dis- tilled water surface. The specimen film was retrieved from the surface using TEM specimen grids, dried in air and examined by means of a Siemens 102 253 transmission electron microscope. Bright-field (BF) electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction (SAD) pattern analyses were used to deter- mine the morphology and chemistry of the specimens. Results When 7-^203 supported Pd is calcined in air at 500 C for ca. 4 h, the particles remaining on the carbon film after HF extraction appear as shown in Fig. l(a). As observed in this electron micrograph and as confirmed by specimen tilting experiments to change diffraction conditions, the particles are essentially flat, almost two-dimensional as seen by the uniform electron density over the entire particle and appear to be bimodal in size distribution. The larger particles (arrow 1) are ca. 7 nanometer (nm) or less, while the smaller particles (arrow 2) are ca. 2 nm or less. (a) (b) Fig. 1. (a) TEM micrograph of calcined Pd/'y-Al^Oa showing bimodal Pd and PdO particle size distribution, (b) Upper half: SADP of a specimen area containing mostly PdO; lower half: SADP of a specimen area containing PdO and Pd. 254 Figure l(b) contains a composite electron diffraction pattern consisting of two halves of SAD patterns from two areas of the specimen. The upper half is from an area of the specimen which is, mainly PdO, while the lower half is from an area containing a higher percentage of Pd particles and a lower percentage of PdO particles. As seen in these patterns, the most charac- teristic ring of PdO(lOl) (dioi ~ 0.264 nm) is sharp (narrow), which is indi- cative of larger crystalline particles [3]. The most characteristic ring of Pd(lll) (dui ~ 0.225 nm), which is more diffuse (or wider), is indicative of smaller particles. After another portion of the above Pd/7-Al203 catalyst sample was heated at 500 C for ca. 4 h in flowing 1% hydrogen, the non-HF soluble particulates were transformed into Pd particles as seen in Fig, 2(a). The par- ticle sizes are limited to a range of ca. 3 -10 nm in diameter. While many still appear to be flat or two-dimensional with uniform density, as for example particle 1, many others show signs of three-dimensional growth, denser in the middle and less dense around the edge (particle 2). Some grains exhibit twin growth, i.e. two different densities with a sharp boundary (particle 3 and as seen more clearly (arrows b) at two tilt conditions in Figs. 2(c) and (d)). The SAD pattern shown in Fig. 2(b) reveals particle growth with more crystalline orientation as evidenced by its spotty nature, when compared to the SAD pattern before reduction (Fig. l(b)). The absence of a PdO pattern also indicates all particles have been reduced by the hydrogen treatment. The second type of catalyst specimen, which contained ca. 34% W by weight of the high surface area 7^203 washcoat, was also calcined at 500 C in air for ca. 4 h. As shown in the electron micrograph of Fig. 3(a), this sample has a similar bimodal particle size distribution, with the particles, on the average, larger than similar particles on the specimen containing 7-A403 only, but there is very little evidence of three-dimensional particle growth. Also shown by the arrows are large coalesced particles of very low but uni- form distribution density, which apparently are lying on top of several small particles. As observed from the SAD pattern in Fig. 3(b), all particles are Pd with no sign of PdO. When another portion of the Pd-W/7-Al203 catalyst sample was heated to 550 \"C in flowing 1% hydrogen for ca. 4 h, non-soluble particles, as shown in Figs. 4(a) and (c), are formed. Definite evidence of coalescence is observed from the elongated shape (arrows in Fig. 4(a) and arrow 1 in Fig. 4(c)) as well as evidence of particle recrystallization, probably by a twin growth mechanism [7 - 9] (arrows 2 in Fig. 4(c)), while the small particles (<2 nm) still remain. SAD patterns (Figs. 4(b) and (d) from areas of Figs. 4(a) and (c) respectively) both indicate the presence of only metallic Pd, and further indi- cate grain growth with more preferred orientation (less random arrangement) when compared to the SAD pattern in Fig. 3(b) of the specimen before hydrogen reduction. The micrographs clearly indicate that the large grains are the result of coalescence of several smaller particles, but fine particles are also observed under the large particles (arrow 1 in Fig. 4(c)). These fine particles have been determined from stereo pair images to lie on different 256 (a) (b) Fig. 8. (a) TEM micrograph of calcined Pd-W/y-Al^Og showing bimodal Pd particle size distribution, (b) SADP of area in (a) indicating metallic, Pd. image planes, otherwise they would most likely have been incorporated into the larger particles. The electron micrograph in Fig. 5(a) shows the morphology of a Pd/-y- AlaOa sample observable without dissolving the HF solubles. Here, knowing what the Pd particles look like from Fig. 2(a), one can analyze the particles (arrows 1) overlaid on the image of the 7-^303 particles (shown more clear- ly by arrows 2). But the image is not clear and particle size information is not easily retrieved as in the extraction replication method. Figure 5(b), an SAD pattern from the area of Fig. 5(a), shows J-Al^Oy with only a trace of Pd (the pattern for Pd is so faint using these exposure conditions it cannot be readily discerned whether PdO is present or not). Discussion In this report the authors' primary interest has been focused on com- plex changes in the particle size and morphology of a Pd-W/'y-AlaOa catalyst 258 Fig. 5. (a) TEM micrograph of reduced Pd/'y-Al^Oa showing reduced Pd particles of alu- mina substrate, (b) SADP of area in (a) indicating ^-Al^Oy (original negative contained faint Pd lines). compared to a Pd/7-Al203 catalyst under oxidizing and reducing conditions. Although in most respects the observations made in this study regarding the Pd/7-Al203 catalyst are consistent with the literature [4-6], the authors' SAD pattern analysis has revealed the small particles to be Pd and not PdO, which is unexpected under equilibrium oxidation conditions at this tempera- ture. The larger particles were identified as PdO as expected. The finer grain size of the Pd particles caused more diffuseness in the SAD pattern. From the results of this investigation, the mechanism of Pd particle formation from initial PdCIs is postulated as shown in Fig. 6. When the PdC^-treated 7-A1203 support is heated in air for 4 h at 500 C, PdCli is decomposed and very small particles of Pd are formed on the 7^203, while at the same time some of the small Pd particles have sintered and are completely oxidized to PdO. A number of sintering mechanisms such as crystalline migration and coalescence, direct ripening and Ostwald ripening, similar to those described 259 in detail by Chen and Ruckenstein [ 5], have been proposed to explain the particle growth here. In addition Chen and Ruckenstein [6] reported that the formation of PdO is characterized by a growth in particle size due to (a) coalescence between PdO particles as their volume increases and (b) spread- ing of the oxidized crystallites on ^-Al^O^ due to a smaller wetting angle of PdO on 7^203 compared to Pd on 7-A1203. On the other hand, when the calcined Pd/7-Al203 specimen was heat treated in a reducing atmosphere of 1% hydrogen at 550 C for 4 h, PdO was reduced to Pd and the fine Pd particles were enlarged by similar sintering mechanisms [5]. But, due to decreased interfacial strength between Pd and 7-A403 when compared to metal oxide 7-^203 interfacial strength, the characteristics of shape and the crystallography are sensitively controlled by irregularities in the 7^203 substrate such as exposed crystallographic PdC4 pd \\\\\\W\\\\\\\\W\\'\\ .r> Pd P^O pd P^ pd m u I ^ P^ ' P^ ^^^^ h\\R .

Also, using more sophisticated electron diffraction pattern and lattice image analysis, Ogawa and Ino [8] and Smith and Marks [9] demonstrated that the three- dimensional particle shapes grow by multiple twinning processes when there is low interfacial interaction between the substrate and the small particles. When the interaction strength is weak the Pd particles, as shown by arrow 3 in Fig. 2(a), are formed with a surface composed of {111} planes [7, 8] to minimize surface energy. This produces almost spherical particles that are most likely decahedron or icosahedron particles as identified by Ogawa and Ino [8]. Further evidence of multiple twinned particles (arrows a) and single twinned particles (arrows b) are shown at higher magnification at two tilt conditions in Figs. 2(c) and (d). In the second part of this work the 7^203 support has been treated with ammoniated tungstic acid prior to Pd impregnation. As shown schemat- ically in Fig. 7, after heat treatment in air the tungstic acid probably forms a continuous film covering the 7^203 substrate, since Murrell et at. [10] reported XPS data showing no evidence of surface 7-A403 after tungstic acid had been deposited on 7-A1203 when the concentration level of tungstic acid was higher than 10%. As further depicted in Fig. 7, and shown in Fig. 3(a), impregnation of this W/7-A1203 support with Pdd2 followed by calcination in air produces a similar particle size distribution as with the Pd/7-Al203 catalyst, i.e. the grain size distribution is also bimodal with large particles overlapping small particles. However, a distinct difference is revealed by the SAD pattern. Fig. 260 3(b), which indicates the presence of Pd only for all particle sizes and not PdO. It is possible that PdO is molecularly dispersed on the WO 3 surface and could be removed from the carbon film during HF dissolution, but this has not been confirmed. When the Pd-W/7-Al203 system is exposed to 1% hydrogen at 550 C for 4 h, a transformation of the WOa support is postulated, which may occur due to Pd catalyzing the reduction of W03 to lower oxides of tungsten or even to metallic W (although not verified to date, this is under investigation by XPS techniques). The reduction process of WOs has not been proven yet for this specimen, because the W03-,c oxides were found to dissolve in HF solution during the HF extraction replication procedure. The absence of W was confirmed by EDS analysis in STEM. However, there are several reports, one by Iguchi [11] and one by Anderson and Hyde [12], that a homologous series of crystal structures of reduced WO 3-^ form by crystallographic shear transformation in a similar manner to that observed in the TiO; and Mo03 systems.

Schematic diagram depicting oxidation-reduction stages in Pd-W/7-Al203 catalyst. The bright-field micrograph in Fig. 4(c) shows large quasi-two-dimen- sional particles which indicate a strong Pd-W03 support interaction. An ex- tensive investigation has been carried out by Tauster et al. [13] on strong metal-support interactions which occur among the binary oxides of Groups HA to VB. Although those authors did not specifically investigate the Pd- W03 system, their interpretations may be applicable to this present system. Their results show that strong metal-support interaction was not observed in A1203, but on most of the transition metal oxides within a homologous series of crystal structures such as TiOx, VOx, NbO^ and TaOx, strong metal- support interactions were observed. The crystal structures vary through crys- tallographic shear transformation as the saturated metal oxides are reduced. The WOx system will also reduce through CS transformation. When the micrographs in Figs. 2(a), (c) and (d) (the Pd/7-Al203 system) are compared with the micrographs of Fig. 4 (the Pd-W/7-Al203 system), a strong Pd-W03 interaction is definitely shown because of the persistence of bimodal particle sizes with two-dimensional morphology. A correlation between strong metal-support interaction and reducibility of the surface of a saturated tran- 261 sition metal oxide was tentatively interpreted by Tauster et al. [13] as due to the following mechanisms: (a) removal of the d orbital occupancy of the cations; and (b) elimination of the oxygen anions from the surface via H^O formation. Further evidence of a strong interaction using the Pd-Mo03/7- A403 system was established by Kozlovetal. [14]. Assuming an analogous behavior, the morphological, chemical and crystallographic changes in the Pd-W/7-Al203 system may be explained in a way similar to that of other transition metal oxides with a homologous series of crystal structures. Many large particles in the reduced Pd-W/7-Al203 specimen contain fewer numbers of small particles than before reduction. This change may possibly be due to sintering between particles of different grain size initiated by the elimination of a thin layer of oxide during the hydrogen treatment. At the same time the treatment lowered the wetting angle. Thus the large grains grew more two-dimensionally. Therefore, in order to establish more precise integration of the observed results in this study, further investigation is needed by means of TEM-STEM where the metallic elements as well as the non-metallic elements are quantitatively measured on a scale of the ex- tremely fine particles (less than 2 nm) observed in this study. Conclusions From the results of this preliminary TEM investigation of the Pd/'y- Al2C>3 and Pd-W/7-Al203 catalyst systems which have been calcined in air and reduced in flowing hydrogen, the following conclusions may be drawn: 1. When a 7-A1203 substrate containing Pd is calcined, fine metallic Pd particles and coarser PdO particles are formed in close proximity to one another. Alternatively fine Pd particles are formed, then oxidized and grown to a size dictated by the calcining conditions. This process thus provides two oxidation states of Pd, namely Pd and Pd2'1'. Under reducing conditions, as shown in this report, many particles are observed to have grown in the third dimension by a number of processes including multiple twinning, while others remain relatively flat. 2. When a second substrate of tungsten is added to the system, the situation becomes very different. The apparent particle morphology in this system is essentially the same as the first case where Pd/7-Al203 is calcined in air, but the chemistry is not the same since there is no evidence of PdO particles from the electron diffraction pattern. Secondly, there are more instances of coalesced particles and fewer fine particles observed near the coalesced particles. This may be an indication of increased layered growth on the tungsten surface, as contrasted to the 7^203 surface [7] with no ap- parent attraction for oxygen. Thus the particle shape is maintained flat pro- viding a high surface to volume ratio, and the relatively small particles are retained during these calcining conditions. When the Pd-W/7-Al203 system is heat treated in hydrogen, the situa- tion becomes even more complex in particle morphology evolution. Again 262 no PdO is detected from SAD pattern studies. However, a very distinct fea- ture is the existence of large two-dimensionally coalesced particles with fewer very small particles retained. The persistence of these small particles and the almost planar growth of large grains could be explained by very strong interaction with W and Pd, especially when fresh surfaces of Pd and W are provided by Ha treatment. The formation of two-dimensional large grains may be explained in a manner similar to that of other transition metal oxides with homologous crystal structures. 3. Although there may be other techniques which could be used to remove the support material in order to study catalyst particle morphology and chemistry, the HF extraction replica procedure has proved valuable in studying the Pt-Pt02/7-Al203 system [2]. Studies comparing the morpho- logy and chemistry of Pd and PdO particles before and after HF treatment have also shown no effect except those particles categorized as 'disperse phase'.

Preliminary studies comparing the morphology and chemical nature of a Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst with a Pd-W/γ-Al2O3 catalyst have been carried out using transmission electron microscopy. Evidence is presented to indicate that the incorporation of a high concentration of tungsten changes the palladium particle characteristics after calcination in air at 500 °C and also after reduction in hydrogen at 550 °C. When Pd/γ-Al2O3 is calcined in air, small palladium particles (⩽ 2 nm) are formed in addition to larger palladium oxide particles (⩽ 7 nm). Both types of particles are thin, essentially two-dimensional, resulting in a high surface to volume ratio. On the other hand, the palladium particles formed during reduction contain a narrow size range (ca. 3–10 nm) with many particles assuming a three-dimensional symmetry, thus providing a lower surface to volume ratio. Pd-W/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, when calcined in air, also produces an essentially two-dimensional bimodal particle size distribution, but in this sytem the particles are all metallic palladium with no oxides detected. After heating this specimen in hydrogen, only a small increase in the particle size range, with a slight decrease in the concentration of small particles, was noted indicating a strong interaction between particles and substrate. Thus a high palladium surface area is retained in this catalyst. References 1 (a) K.M. Adams and H.S. Gandhi, U. S. Pat. Appl., 284 759 (July 20, 1981) (b) H.S. Gandhi and K.M. Adams, U.S. Pat.

        "dc:description": "Preliminary studies comparing the morphology and chemical nature of a Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst with a Pd-W/γ-Al2O3 catalyst have been carried out using transmission electron microscopy. Evidence is presented to indicate that the incorporation of a high concentration of tungsten changes the palladium particle characteristics after calcination in air at 500 °C and also after reduction in hydrogen at 550 °C. When Pd/γ-Al2O3 is calcined in air, small palladium particles (⩽ 2 nm) are formed in addition to larger palladium oxide particles (⩽ 7 nm). Both types of particles are thin, essentially two-dimensional, resulting in a high surface to volume ratio. On the other hand, the palladium particles formed during reduction contain a narrow size range (ca. 3–10 nm) with many particles assuming a three-dimensional symmetry, thus providing a lower surface to volume ratio. Pd-W/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, when calcined in air, also produces an essentially two-dimensional bimodal particle size distribution, but in this sytem the particles are all metallic palladium with no oxides detected. After heating this specimen in hydrogen, only a small increase in the particle size range, with a slight decrease in the concentration of small particles, was noted indicating a strong interaction between particles and substrate. Thus a high palladium surface area is retained in this catalyst.",
