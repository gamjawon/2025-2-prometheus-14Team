Graphical abstract The immobilization of the chiral complex RhDuphos onto different carbon materials using the SILP methodology (Supported Ionic Liquid Phase) has been investigated with the double purpose of preserving the steric configuration of the Rh complex and of increasing, respect to conventional biphasic systems, the interphase between the ionic liquid and the substrates. The prepared SILP catalysts have been tested in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of methyl 2-acetamidoacrylate (MAA) at room temperature and 5.5 bar H2, using water as solvent. All catalysts showed high activity, although low enantioselectivity was observed for the SILP catalysts with the smaller amount of ionic liquid loaded. Upon increased IL loading, higher ee values were obtained. Ionic liquid leaching from the SILP catalyst was observed while the Rh loss was low in all cases. The textural properties of the carbon materials used as support have shown a very significant influence in the catalytic properties of the SILP catalysts, being more interesting supports with mesoporosity. Keywords SILP catalysts Chiral complex Carbon materials Asymmetric hydrogenation 1 Introduction Rh (I) complexes with chiral diphosphines like Duphos ([bis-2,5-dialkylphospholano]benzene) or BPE (bis-2,5-dialkylphospholano]ethane) play a relevant role in asymmetric catalyzed hydrogenations [1–4]. The synthesis of these molecular chiral catalysts is costly and this makes them quite expensive. Besides, due to their homogeneous character, once used they must be separated from the reaction media, and thus, easy recovery and reutilization of such chiral catalysts is a goal that would fulfill economical, technical and environmental issues. Heterogenization of molecular catalysts by immobilization on solid supports is a strategy to overcome the mentioned drawbacks of homogeneous catalysis, especially interesting in the case of chiral complexes. However, the process is a challenge because the catalytic properties of the homogeneous catalyst must be preserved. This is particularly demanding in the case of chiral catalysts because enantioselectivity is easily diminished or lost when the steric configuration of the complex is modified due to strong interactions or bonding with the support. Among the several heterogenization strategies [5–8] the SILP (Supported Ionic Liquid Phase) methodology can be useful to effectively immobilize chiral catalysts. In a SILP system, the homogeneous catalyst is dissolved in a certain amount of ionic liquid (IL) and the solution is dispersed as thin film on the surface of a porous solid material. This concept was first introduced by Mehnert in 2002 [9], and the SILP denomination coined shortly after [10]. It makes, mainly, use of the following facts: many transition metal complexes dissolve well in ionic liquids, ionic liquids show a good wettability on many supports and due to the development of strong capillary forces, the obtained material is a dry solid that can be used as a conventional heterogeneous catalyst. As indicated by Öchsner et al. [11], in such a system the dissolved catalyst still acts microscopically as a homogeneously dissolved complex in its uniform ionic liquid environment. Some other examples of literature on this topic can be found in references [12–22]. It must be mentioned that ionic liquids are ideal for this application because they are versatile solvents with tunable solubility properties and very low vapor pressure (particularly relevant in gas-phase reactions) [23–25]. The advantages of a SILP system for the immobilization of chiral catalysts can be outlined and summarized as follows: the immobilization by means of a supported solution leads to a limited modification of the physical and chemical properties of the molecular catalyst, in contrast to covalent anchorage or strong adsorption. On the other hand, and compared to an IL-solvent biphasic system, a SILP catalyst has a much larger interface that could lead to higher reaction rates. A schematic representation of a SILP catalytic system (with the Rh complex used in the present work) is shown in Fig. 1 . Obviously, the solid support plays a relevant role in SILP systems. However, this aspect has not been in the focus of most of the published works dealing with SILP catalysts. In fact, usually conventional supports like silica and alumina have been used and they are mentioned only sideways, not being considered as a variable of the system; in contrast with the interest shown in other aspects like the IL nature and loading. Carbon materials show big potential as catalysts supports as they can be prepared with large surface areas and appropriated pore size, and their surface chemistry can be tuned. These properties have clear effects on the dispersion of the active species and on the diffusion of reactants and products to and from the supported active sites. Several reviews about carbon materials as catalysts supports can be found in the literature [7,8,26–31]. However, the literature dealing with the use of carbon materials as supports in SILP catalysts is relatively scarce; as a sign of that it can be mentioned that good reviews on SILP systems do not mention the use of carbon materials as support [12,15]. Nevertheless, although not very abundant, there are some works reporting the use of carbon materials in SILP systems, either SILP hybrids [32,33], or catalysts in which the active species are metal particles [34,35], metal complexes [18,19,21,22] or the own IL [36]. The above comments reveal, on one side, that the role of the support should be better investigated and, on the other side, that the use of carbon materials for the development of SILP catalysts is a relatively unexplored field, which can lead to promising results. This work deals with the preparation of hybrid chiral catalysts by means of the SILP methodology using different carbon materials as support. The purpose is to study the capabilities of this kind of materials for the mentioned application and, also to investigate the effect of the carbon support properties on the catalytic behavior (activity, selectivity, stability). The SILP catalysts subject of this study have been prepared with the RhDuphos complex (1,2-bis[(2R,5R)-2,5-dimethylphospholane] benzene-(cyclooctadiene)rhodium(I) tetrafluoroborate) and the [C4C1Im][PF6] ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate), and they have been tested in the asymmetric hydrogenation of methyl 2-acetamidoacrylate (MAA) (see Scheme in Fig. 2 ). The hydrogenation of enamides is considered a standard test reaction for chiral phosphine ligands, but it is also a very important reaction providing one of the most efficient, cost effective methods for the production of valuable enantiomerically pure amino acid derivatives [37]. To finish, it can be mentioned that this work is based on the experience of the research group in the heterogenization of metal complexes using carbon materials as support (an example can be found in the references [38–43]). It has the ambitious goal of immobilizing effectively a chiral homogeneous catalyst in this kind of materials, and for such a purpose the SILP methodology has been considered the most suitable. Furthermore, the work explores the behavior of the heterogenized catalysts in a liquid phase reaction, what implies very challenging conditions for a SILP catalyst. 2 Experimental The catalysts have been prepared by the SILP methodology using four different commercial carbon materials as supports. The next paragraphs describe the carbon materials, the catalyst preparation and characterization methods, and the procedures used in the activity tests performed to study the catalytic behaviour of the prepared SILP catalysts in the asymmetric hydrogenation of methyl 2-acetamidoacrylate. 2.1 Supports description and catalysts preparation The following commercial carbon materials were used as support: GeA: Spherical shaped activated carbon prepared from a phenolic resin by Gun-ei Chemical Industry (Japan). The spheres have an average diameter of 150 μm. KA: Spherical shaped activated carbon produced from petroleum pitch by Kureha Corporation (Japan). The spheres have an average diameter of 780 μm. T: Carbon black T-10157 from Columbian Chemical Company (USA). SA: Powder activated carbon SA-30 from MeadWestvaco (USA). These carbon materials show important differences regarding porosity, surface chemistry and morphology. The catalysts were prepared using the ionic liquid [C4C1Im][PF6] (1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium hexafluorophosphate) and the RhDuphos complex (1,2-bis[(2R,5R)-2,5-dimethylphospholane] benzene-(cyclooctadiene)rhodium(I) tetrafluoroborate) as follows: In a Schlenk apparatus, a solution of the appropriate amounts of ionic liquid (IL) and RhDuphos (to achieve 20 or 40 wt% IL and 1 wt% Rh loading), and 2 mL anhydrous acetone was added to 0.5 g of the outgassed (vacuum, 423 K, 5 h) support. The mixture was kept at room temperature under Ar atmosphere and stirring until the solvent was removed and the sample took on the original dry aspect of the support. The catalysts were stored in glass containers inside an inert atmosphere chamber. Catalysts nomenclature is SUP-xx-RhDuphos, where SUP accounts for the name of the support and xx is the amount of ionic liquid loaded expressed as wt% of IL in the whole catalyst. 2.2 Characterization of supports and catalysts The textural properties were determined by gas adsorption (N2 at 77 K and CO2 at 273 K) after outgassing (vacuum, 423 K, 5 h), using an Autosorb 6-B apparatus from Quantachrome. N2 adsorption data have been used: i) to calculate the BET surface area, ii) to calculate the micropore volume (Vμp) by applying the Dubinin-Radushkevich equation, and iii) to determine the mesopore volume (up to 7 nm, Vmeso) as the difference between the volume of N2 adsorbed at P/P0 = 0.99 and at P/P0 = 0.2. The volume of narrow micropores (diameter smaller than 0.7 nm, Vnμp) has been calculated by application of the Dubinin-Radushkevich equation to the CO2 adsorption data. The non-microporous surface area (Sext) has been calculated by the t method. The fundamentals of gas adsorption for the determination of porosity in solids, and the explanations on data treatment to obtain the above mentioned parameters are well reported in the literature [44–46]. The surface chemistry of the carbon materials has been assessed by Temperature Programmed desorption (TPD) experiments (He flow (100 mL/min), 10 K/min up to 1273 K) in a thermobalance (SDT TA Instruments 2960) coupled to a mass spectrometer (Balzers MSC 200 Thermostar). To determine the amount of Rh in the fresh and used catalysts, they were treated to extract the metal, and then the solutions were analysed by ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optic Emission Spectroscopy). The experimental procedure was as follows: about 30 mg catalyst were treated with 15 mL of a mixture H2SO4(95%):HNO3(69%) (2:1), under reflux, until the solid was completely decomposed. Then, 8 mL of a 1:3 HNO3(69%):HCl(37%) solution was added and the mixture was heated until the remaining volume was approximately 3 mL. Finally, distilled water was added up to 10 mL. The amount of ionic liquid in fresh and used catalysts was determined by thermogravimetry (SDT TA Instruments 2960, N2 flow (100 mL/min), 10 K/min up to 1073 K). The weight loss registered in fresh and used catalysts corresponds, respectively, to the amount of ionic liquid originally loaded and remaining on the catalysts after use in a catalytic activity run. Thus, by comparing the TG profiles of fresh and used catalysts it is possible to estimate the amount of ionic liquid lost during the reaction (leaching). The unloaded supports were also analyzed in order to have reference TG profiles and to be able to correct a potential mass loss due to the decomposition of surface oxygen groups. Fresh and used catalysts were also characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a VG-Microtech Multilab 3000 equipment, and by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) using a JEM-2010 JEOL microscope. 2.3 Catalytic activity measurements and analysis The catalysts were tested in the liquid-phase asymmetric hydrogenation of 2-methyl-acetamidoacrylate, using water as solvent. The reactor was loaded inside an inert atmosphere chamber with 30 mg SILP catalyst, 100 mg MAA and 7 mL water (substrate:catalyst ratio of 250), and then it was closed with a septum. Afterwards, the reactor was placed in a polyethylene glycol bath at 298 K, purged, and pressurized with 5.5 bar hydrogen. Then, stirring was started and the reaction time set to zero, being the activity tests performed for 1.5, 3 or 21 h reaction time. Afterwards, the catalyst was recovered by filtration in order to reuse it (under the same conditions) or to perform its characterization. For a biphasic reference system, the catalyst was a solution of 0.0017 mg RhDuphos in 0.0067 g ionic liquid (these are the amounts of RhDuphos and IL contained in 30 mg of a SILP catalyst with 20 wt% IL). A homogeneous phase test was also carried out dissolving 0.0017 mg RhDuphos in the substrate solution. Once the reaction finished, the solution drawn from the reactor was divided in two fractions for analysis. One fraction was analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC 1260 Infinity Binary LC System, equipped with a LiChrospher 100 RP-18 (5 μm) column) in order to determine the substrate conversion. The other one was submitted to an extraction process (5 × 2 mL of diethyl ether), being the extracts analyzed by gas chromatography (GC HP6890 Series II, using the chiral column CP-1 Chirasil-l-Val 25 m × 250 μm × 0.12 μm) to determine the enatiomeric excess (ee). 3 Results 3.1 Textural properties of carbon materials Fig. 3 shows the N2 adsorption isotherms (77 K) obtained for the four carbon materials, which reveal that they are supports with widely different porosity and pore size distributions. The N2 adsorption isotherms of samples KA and GeA are type I according to the IUPAC classification, typical of microporous solids, while the isotherms of samples SA and T are a combination of types I and IV, characteristic of samples with micro and mesoporosity [44–46]. Table 1 shows a summary of the textural properties calculated from N2 adsorption (77 K) and CO2 adsorption (273 K) as indicated in the experimental section. The four supports have a large specific surface area. Among them, the large surface area of the carbon black T must be highlighted, and it means that probably its preparation includes an activation step. Regarding porosity, data of Table 1 show that samples KA and GeA are essentially microporous while samples T and SA contain a significant amount of both micro and mesopores and because of that, these samples show a larger Sext. The pore size distribution has been determined by using the DFT method, and in the case of samples with mesopores (T and SA) the BJH method has been also used (Fig. S1b (ESI)) (the calculation methods are implemented in the analysis software of the adsorption apparatus). An average pore size has been determined from the pore size distributions obtained with the DFT method (Table 1), but it must be considered that carbon SA, and especially carbon T, contain an important amount of larger pores. This indicates that carbon T has a special porous structure composed of both meso- and micropores, consequence of the typical structure of carbon blacks but also of its activation treatment. As reported by Donnet and Voet [47], carbon blacks are materials composed essentially of elemental carbon in the form of near-spherical particles of colloidal sizes, coalesced mainly into particle aggregates obtained by partial combustion or thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons. This means that the basic porosity can be defined by the voids between aggregates that can have variable dimensions and shapes. The primary near-spherical particles are constituted of graphitic crystallites in which an activation treatment would create narrow pores by the removal of one or more plane layers by oxidation [47–49], leading, thus, to microporosity. 3.2 Surface chemistry Table 2 shows the amount of CO2 and CO evolved (in μmol/g) from the different supports in TPD experiments (the obtained TPD profiles are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI)). The total amount of atomic oxygen (calculated from the amount of CO2 and CO evolved), expressed as wt%, has been also included. Data of Table 2 show important differences between the samples, being supports GeA and SA those with the largest amount of oxygen surface groups. The TPD profiles have been also analysed in order to estimate the nature of the oxygen functional groups (OFG) present on the carbons surface. Such an analysis has been done according to the decomposition temperature of different surface OFG reported in the literature [50–53]. Regarding the CO2 evolution, it has been found that only carbon SA contains a significant amount of surface oxygen functional groups (OFG) that decompose in the low temperature range. In general terms, it can be considered that the CO2 profile presents two main relative maxima located at about 450 and 800 K, that can be assigned, respectively, to the decomposition of carboxylic acid and anhydride type surface OFG. In the case of sample GeA, the important evolution of CO2 at high temperature can be, mainly, associated with the decomposition of lactone type surface groups. In samples KA and T, the CO2 evolution is much lower, and it is mainly assigned to the decomposition of lactone OFG in the case of carbon KA, while carbon T seems to contain less lactone but some carboxylic type groups (relative maxima at about 900 and 500 K, respectively). The evolution of CO is the largest for sample SA and it corresponds to the decomposition of anhydride, and likely, also phenol, ether, carbonyl and quinone type OFG. In sample GeA, the CO evolution profile indicates that the OFG present are mainly ether, carbonyl and quinone, while in sample KA, only very stable quinone type OFG seem to be present. In carbon T, the OFGs that decompose as CO, although in low amount, are varied like in the case of sample SA. 3.3 Activity results Table 3 shows MAA conversion and enantiomeric excess (ee) data obtained with catalysts SUP-20-RhDuphos and with the homogeneous and biphasic systems in experiments of 1.5, 3 and 21 h reaction time. All catalysts give a high MAA conversion, and the comparison with biphasic and homogeneous systems (at 3 h) shows that the SILP catalysts are as active as the biphasic system, although less active than the homogeneous one. However, the SILP catalysts show a very low enantioselectivity. It is worth noting that the biphasic system is clearly less enantioselective than the homogeneous one and this could indicate that the interaction of the Rh complex with the IL changes its chemical or conformational properties reducing its chiral directing capacity. Comparing the results obtained with the different catalysts, an important effect of the support properties on the catalysts behaviour can be observed. In general, the catalyst prepared with support T gives the highest conversion and enantioselectivity, very close to the one obtained with the biphasic system. Interestingly, for the T-20-RhDuphos system, the ee kept rising with time in a constant manner, thereby exceeding the ee of the biphasic system after 21 h of reaction time. In order to study the effect of the ionic liquid loading in the catalysts behaviour, samples with 40 wt% IL have been also tested. Although conversion is not significantly influenced by the IL loading, a noticeable effect in the enantioselectivity has been observed. Table 4 compares ee data obtained for catalysts with 20 and 40 wt% IL in 1.5 h tests. These results show that enantioselectivity noticeably increases when the ionic liquid loading increases from 20 to 40 wt%. This could be interpreted considering that a higher amount of ionic liquid in the support porosity leads to a situation of higher IL volume in the Rh complex environment that helps to keep its configuration, with the advantage, compared to the biphasic system, of involving a large interphase between the dissolved active phase and the substrate solution. As a high ee has been obtained with catalyst T-40-RhDuphos, support T was used to prepare a catalyst with an even higher IL loading, 75 wt%, which is the maximum IL amount that this support can accept according to our previous work [54]. The ee of such a catalyst is 69%, indicating that the enantioselectivity remains high, but a further improvement has not been achieved. These results are in accordance with previous studies, where also high pore filling of SILP systems in gas-phase chiral hydrogenation was found to be beneficial for both activity and ee [11]. One reason of this behavior can be the better protection of the chiral catalyst from possible support interactions (leading to ligand degradation). Since the hydrogenation itself is a rather slow reaction (especially below 30 °C and 10 bar H2), mass transport effects do not seem to play a significant role. Reuse of catalyst T-40-RhDuphos was also investigated. Conversion and ee values in two consecutive catalytic runs are shown in Table 5 . These results show that the catalyst is reusable, without loss of conversion and enantioselectivity in a second run. In addition, the increased conversion and enantioselectivity in the second run hints for a possible preformation of the most active and selective catalytic species. This would explain the better ee values after 21 h reaction time in the case of T-20-RhDuphos (see Table 3). Further results, presented next, have allowed to propose a tentative interpretation of the effect of the support properties, which can be found in the last paragraph of the Results part (paragraph 3.6.). 3.4 Catalysts stability 3.4.1 Ionic liquid leaching In this work we use the previously developed [54] thermogravimetric (TG) method to determine the IL leaching. Fig. 4 shows, as an example, the TG curves obtained for catalyst T-20-RhDuphos, fresh and spent (1.5 h test). Data corresponding to the original support have been also included. This kind of experiments clearly reveal differences in the amount of IL present on the fresh and used catalysts. IL leaching is presented in Table 6 as gram of IL leached per gram of catalyst. The amount of IL remaining in each sample has been also included in Table 6, expressed as gram of IL per gram of catalyst and as% of the original IL loading. As shown in Table 6, the absolute amount of ionic liquid leached (first column) is higher in samples with higher initial IL loading and it is noticeably higher for catalysts prepared with support T. This can be also clearly observed in the remaining IL data (second column). In the case of catalyst T-40-RhDuphos, IL leaching was also investigated after a 3 h reaction test. The obtained data (Table 6) show that the amount of ionic liquid that remains on the catalyst does not vary with reaction time. This seems to indicate that, in general, the samples lose a certain amount of ionic liquid in the first minutes or reaction and then the sample is stable. The absolute amount of remaining IL is similar in catalysts T-20-RhDuphos and T-40-RhDuphos but they give a quite different enantioselectivity. This fact indicates that the location of the IL seems to be different in both samples. As previously reported [54], the porosity occupation (volume and type of pores) depends on the original IL loading, thus it can be assumed that the remaining IL has a different surrounding in each sample. Thus, in T-40-RhDuphos, although the amount of remaining IL is only slightly higher than in T-20-RhDuphos, the complex solution must be located in such a way that most of the RhDuphos molecules keep their enantioselective capacity. 3.4.2 Rh leaching Data of Rh leaching after 1.5 h reaction tests are presented in Table 7 . They are expressed as% leached (respect to the original loading) and amount leached in μmol per gram of catalyst. Data of Table 7 show that Rh leaching is low, in general, much less than 10% of the original loading is lost, meaning that the catalysts stability regarding this aspect is good. If the solution of the rhodium complex in the ionic liquid was homogeneous, and assuming that the solubility of the Rh complex in the IL and in the IL/water mixture is similar, Rh leaching should have to be proportional to IL leaching. Considering the mentioned assumptions, a theoretical Rh leaching has been calculated from IL leaching data. Data are shown in Table 7, last column. A comparison between calculated and actual Rh leaching indicates that the Rh complex is not homogeneously dissolved in the supported ionic liquid, and it can be accepted that the complex is mainly located close to the support surface with some interaction with it. A similar result has been previously reported for analogous SILP catalysts prepared with the RhCOD complex and used in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene [19]. 3.5 XPS and TEM characterization As previously reported [55,56], in many cases the anchored complex is partially reduced under reaction conditions. To study if such a transformation also occurs in this work, some of the used catalysts (1.5 h tests) have been analysed by XPS and TEM. Fresh catalysts have also been analysed in order to have a proper reference. Rh 3d5/2 binding energy in both fresh and used catalysts (shown in Table ST1 of the ESI) corresponds to Rh (I) [57,58], meaning that the electronic state of Rh is not modified upon use (even after three consecutive reaction runs). It should be mentioned that neither the type of support, nor the amount of loaded ionic liquid have a significant effect in this aspect. Fig. 5 shows, as an example, TEM images of catalyst T-40-RhDuphos fresh and used in 3 h and 21 h reaction tests. The fresh catalyst (Fig. 5a) does not show any characteristics different from those of the original support, indicating that it contains the complex well dissolved in the supported ionic liquid. In the used catalyst (Fig. 5b and c), however, some aggregates can be observed. They are surely related with the presence of the Rh complex, but their precise composition has not been determined and they do not present the typical morphology of metallic particles. It seems that they are some particular structures formed due to the interaction between the Rh complex and the ionic liquid. As indicated in the literature, they could be either domains originated by the immobilization of the rhodium complex in the ionic liquid [13,59–61], or IL clusters formed under pressure by the reorganization of hydrogen bonds as indicated by Chang et al. [62]. 3.6 Comment on the support effects The results presented and discussed above show that the carbon materials based SILP catalysts are quite active in the hydrogenation of 2-methyl-acetamidoacrylate. It has been found that the properties of the carbon materials used as support and the original IL loading play a very important role for the enantioselectivity of the SILP catalysts. Catalysts prepared with carbons KA GeA and SA, in spite of their differences in textural properties, surface chemistry and morphology, show all of them a high conversion but a low enantioselectivity. It is quite low in catalysts with 20 wt% IL and increases noticeably, when the IL loading is 40 wt%. On the other hand, catalysts prepared with the carbon black T, show a much higher enantioselectivity. The behaviour of catalyst T-20-RhDuphos is similar to that of the biphasic system. An increase in the IL loading to 40 wt% leads to a very active catalyst with a high enantioselectivity, ee above 70%. An explanation of these results based on leaching and homogeneous phase catalysis is discarded as the Rh leaching is quite low and the catalyst has shown to be reusable. The better performance of catalysts prepared with support T could be related to the structure of its porosity, very different in carbon blacks respect to activated carbons. Considering the estimated dimensions of the RhDuphos complex, approximately 1.1 × 1.0 × 0.7 nm (Fig. S3), it can be expected that it would be too constricted in the slit shaped or cylindrical micropores, typical of carbons KA, GeA and SA (average size 1.2–2.1 nm, see Table 1), and it would lose its effective chiral configuration. The porosity of the carbon black T, with a significant amount of large pores with the irregular shape left by particles aggregation, seems to preserve better the molecular configuration of the Rh complex. On the other hand, although it retains the IL less effectively than the activated carbons, the complex seems to have some interaction with the support surface that hinders the Rh leaching. These results show that effective heterogenised chiral catalysts can be prepared by the SILP methodology using carbon materials as support. The porosity and the IL loading are very relevant parameters. A further study should include the use of supports with an important contribution of mesoporosity, but also the screening of different ionic liquids to determine how the nature of the IL affects to the interaction with the Rh complex and the carbon surface. 4 Conclusions Chiral hybrid catalysts have been prepared by the SILP methodology with the complex RhDuphos (1,2-bis[(2R,5R)-2,5-dimethylphospholane] benzene-(cyclooctadiene)rhodium(I) tetrafluoroborate) and the ionic liquid [C4C1Im][PF6] (1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium hexafluorophosphate), and using different carbon materials as support. The catalysts have been tested in the hydrogenation of 2-methyl acetoamidoacrylate, giving a high substrate conversion, which is almost independent of the support properties and of the IL loading. However, these two parameters have a strong influence in the catalysts enantioselectivity. The highest ee is obtained with the catalysts prepared with support T, and in this case it has been observed that enantioselectivity noticeably increases when the amount of ionic liquid increases from 20 to 40 wt%. Values of enantiomeric excess higher than 70% have been achieved with catalyst T-40-RhDuphos. This catalyst has shown to be reusable, keeping good values of activity and enantioselectivity. XPS and TEM data reveal that the Rh complex is not reduced upon reaction. Thus, it can be concluded that using the appropriate carbon support, hybrid SILP chiral catalysts of acceptable enantioselectivity and reusable character can be prepared.

        "dc:description": "The immobilization of the chiral complex RhDuphos onto different carbon materials using the SILP methodology (Supported Ionic Liquid Phase) has been investigated with the double purpose of preserving the steric configuration of the Rh complex and of increasing, respect to conventional biphasic systems, the interphase between the ionic liquid and the substrates. The prepared SILP catalysts have been tested in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of methyl 2-acetamidoacrylate (MAA) at room temperature and 5.5 bar H2, using water as solvent. All catalysts showed high activity, although low enantioselectivity was observed for the SILP catalysts with the smaller amount of ionic liquid loaded. Upon increased IL loading, higher ee values were obtained. Ionic liquid leaching from the SILP catalyst was observed while the Rh loss was low in all cases. The textural properties of the carbon materials used as support have shown a very significant influence in the catalytic properties of the SILP catalysts, being more interesting supports with mesoporosity.",
