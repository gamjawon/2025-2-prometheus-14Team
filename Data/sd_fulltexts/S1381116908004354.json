The PLA produced using silica-supported alkoxide catalysts had a higher molecular weight and T m than those produced with the homogeneous catalyst. TiCl(O-i-Pr)3/SiO2 and Ti(O-i-Pr)4/SiO2 were prepared by immobilizing titanium(IV) chloride triisopropoxide (TiCl(O-i-Pr)3) and titanium(IV) tetraisopropoxide (Ti(O-i-Pr)4), respectively, over pretreated silica. A series of solution polymerizations of l-lactide were conducted with homogeneous alkoxide catalysts and silica-supported titanium alkoxide catalysts to compare their catalytic activity and the characteristics of the polylactide (PLA) produced. The conversion of l-lactide with the silica-supported alkoxide catalysts was higher than that with homogeneous catalysts even though the catalyst activity was low. In addition, the PLA produced using silica-supported alkoxide catalysts had a higher molecular weight and T m than those produced with the homogeneous catalyst. Keywords Titanium alkoxide catalyst Silica support Polylactide Ring-opening polymerization 1 Introduction Polylactide (PLA) is biodegradable aliphatic polyester which is synthesized from lactic acid derived from renewable sources such as starch and molasses [1,2]. PLA has excellent mechanical properties comparable to conventional polymers such as PS and PE and has been used for medical devices and industrial packaging materials [3–5]. Over the last two decades, many types of metal alkoxide catalysts such as tin, aluminum, zinc, and magnesium alkoxides have been studied for the ring-opening polymerization of lactide to produce PLA [6–9]. Recently, titanium alkoxides have been investigated as potential catalysts for the ring-opening polymerization of lactide [10–12,15]. Homogeneous titanium alkoxide catalysts for lactide polymerization have been the focus to date. However, from a practical point of view, it would be desirable for these catalysts to be heterogeneous for better control of the polymerization process and easier separation of the catalysts from the polymer product [13,14]. In this work, silica-supported catalysts were prepared by reacting TiCl(O-i-Pr)3 and Ti(O-i-Pr)4 with pretreated silica. A series of solution polymerizations of l-lactide were performed with both the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts to compare the catalyst activities and polymer characteristics. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials l-Lactide (PURASORB L, PURAC) was recrystallized with toluene three times prior to use. Toluene was purified by distillation over sodium metal in a pure nitrogen atmosphere to remove residual traces of moisture and oxygen and was stored over a 4Å molecular sieve. Silica (sylopol 948, Grace Davison) was used as a support to immobilize the catalysts. Titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti(O-i-Pr)4, Sigma, 97%) and titanium chloride triisopropoxide (TiCl(O-i-Pr)3, Sigma, 95%) were used as received without further purification. All processes for monomer purification and catalyst preparation were performed under a dry nitrogen atmosphere. 2.2 Characterization Inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy was used to determine the titanium content of the supported catalysts using ICP-AES (JY Horiva, JY Activa). Specific surface area measurements were performed using the BET method (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020) at 78K using nitrogen as the adsorption gas. Before the measurement, the samples were outgassed at 423K for 4h to reach a final pressure of 10−4 Torr. A scanning electron microscope (JEOL, JSM-6500F) was used to observe the morphologies of the supported catalysts and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was used to measure the titanium content on the surface of the supported catalysts. The number-average and weight-average molecular weights (M n and M w, respectively) and the polydispersity index (PDI, M w/M n) of the produced PLA were determined by gel permeation chromatography (Polymer Laboratory, PL-GPC 120) using CHCl3 as a solvent. The melting temperature of the PLA was determined using differential scanning calorimetry (TA instrument, Q20) from the second heating cycle at a heating rate of 10°C/min. 2.3 Preparation of the supported catalysts A silica support was calcined at 400°C under a 100cc/min stream of N2 for 10h before reacting with catalysts to remove residual traces of moisture and hydroxyl groups on the silica surface. Four grams of calcined silica was suspended in 100ml of dry toluene and the predetermined amount of titanium alkoxide was added. The mixture was stirred for 3h at 50°C and the resulting catalyst was filtered and washed three times with 100ml of toluene. Finally, the slurry was dried for 12h under vacuum and stored in a glove box. 2.4 l-Lactide polymerization Solution polymerization of l-lactide was carried out using a flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Predetermined amounts of purified l-lactide, dried toluene, and homogeneous or supported catalyst were charged, in that order, into a flask under an argon atmosphere. The polymerization was carried out at 70°C for 2, 6, 12, and 24h. The reaction was terminated by addition of 5ml of methanol and the polymer was precipitated in an excess amount of methanol. The obtained polymer was washed with methanol and dried at 50°C under vacuum for 12h. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Solution polymerization of l-lactide with homogeneous catalysts Solution polymerization of l-lactide was carried out at 70°C with TiCl(O-i-Pr)3 or Ti(O-i-Pr)4 catalyst at a l-lactide/catalyst molar ratio of 100. A white and thin plat-shaped polymer was obtained after vacuum drying. The results of lactide polymerization with homogeneous titanium alkoxide catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . The conversion of both TiCl(O-i-Pr)3 and Ti(O-i-Pr)4 catalyst increased with increasing reaction time reaching saturation at around 70% after 6h with TiCl(O-i-Pr)3 catalyst and after 12h with Ti(O-i-Pr)4. Both the homogeneous catalysts showed similar activity profiles, as the catalytic activity was high in the initial stage and then steadily decreased with time on stream. The maximum catalytic activity of TiCl(O-i-Pr)3 was 3897gPLA/(molTi–h), which was 1.5 times higher than that of Ti(O-i-Pr)4. The molecular weights and molecular weight distributions of the PLAs were measured by GPC for the 12h reaction time polymer samples. From the GPC results, the M n and M w of the PLA produced by TiCl(O-i-Pr)3 catalyst were 9590 and 15,100g/mol, respectively and the PDI was 1.41 (Run 3), while the M n and M w of the PLA produced by Ti(O-i-Pr)4 catalyst were 9650 and 13,600g/mol, respectively, and the PDI was 1.57 (Run 4). The T m of the polymer produced with TiCl(O-i-Pr)3 was observed to be around 160°C, which was 5°C higher than that of the polymer produced with Ti(O-i-Pr)4. Based on the fact that the molecular weights were similar to each other, the difference of the T m between the two homogeneous catalysts was not related to the molecular weight. 3.2 Characteristics of silica-supported catalysts Silica-supported catalysts were prepared by reacting TiCl(O-i-Pr)3 or Ti(O-i-Pr)4 with silica which was calcined at 400°C for 10h. Table 2 shows the Ti contents and BET surface areas of the silica-supported titanium catalysts. The silica support has a specific surface area of 260m2/g, while the specific surface areas of TiCl(O-i-Pr)3/SiO2 and Ti(O-i-Pr)4/SiO2 were 246.1 and 229.6m2/g, respectively. It was found that the specific surface areas of the catalysts were slightly decreased by immobilizing the titanium alkoxide on the silica surface. ICP-AES was used to determine the titanium content of the catalyst. When we prepared the supported catalysts, we added an excess amount of catalyst equivalent to 5wt.% titanium based on the support material. As shown in Table 2, the amount of titanium remaining in the catalyst was analyzed. It was found that 60–65% of the titanium was immobilized based on the total titanium added and as a result, the titanium contents of both catalysts were ca. 3wt.%. In addition, EDS analysis was performed to examine the distribution of titanium on the silica surface. The total Ti/Si molar ratio of the TiCl(O-i-Pr)3/SiO2 catalyst was 0.202 as determined by ICP, whereas the Ti/Si molar ratio of the TiCl(O-i-Pr)3/SiO2 catalyst surface was 0.0302 as determined by EDS. Therefore, it is likely that most of the catalyst components existed in the silica pores. The morphologies of silica, TiCl(O-i-Pr)3/SiO2, and Ti(O-i-Pr)4/SiO2 are shown in Fig. 1 . Although the smooth surface of silica became rough after the supporting process, the morphologies of TiCl(O-i-Pr)3/SiO2 and Ti(O-i-Pr)4/SiO2 were comparatively regular and spherical. It is thought that the immobilization of titanium alkoxides did not affect the morphology of the support. 3.3 Characteristics of polymerization with homogeneous and supported catalysts A plot of the conversion to PLA versus time in the solution polymerization of l-lactide with homogeneous TiCl(O-i-Pr)3 and TiCl(O-i-Pr)3/SiO2 catalysts is shown in Fig. 2 . The conversion with homogeneous TiCl(O-i-Pr)3 catalyst remained at around 70% after 6h of reaction, while that with TiCl(O-i-Pr)3/SiO2 increased gradually and the final yield was 30% higher than that with the homogeneous TiCl(O-i-Pr)3 catalyst. If the rate of the polymerization was fast in the beginning of the reaction, the monomer would have difficulty accessing the active center of the catalyst due to mass transfer limitations. The rate of polymerization with TiCl(O-i-Pr)3/SiO2 was slower than that of the homogeneous catalyst but its final conversion was much higher than that with TiCl(O-i-Pr)3 catalyst. It is interesting to note that the catalyst activity of TiCl(O-i-Pr)3 was much higher than that of TiCl(O-i-Pr)3/SiO2 at the beginning of the reaction, but it rapidly decreased with time on stream (Fig. 3 ). In contrast, the maximum catalytic activity of TiCl(O-i-Pr)3/SiO2 was 1830gPLA/(molTi–h), which was much lower than that of the TiCl(O-i-Pr)3 catalyst which decreased slowly with increasing time on stream. Table 3 shows the characteristics of the produced PLA with both the homogeneous and heterogeneous titanium alkoxide catalysts. The molecular weight of PLA produced with TiCl(O-i-Pr)3/SiO2 was 2.5 times higher than the PLA made with TiCl(O-i-Pr)3. The molecular weight of PLA produced with TiCl(O-i-Pr)3 at 70°C for 12h was 13,600g/mol, while that of the PLA made with TiCl(O-i-Pr)3/SiO2 under the same conditions was 36,200g/mol. The molecular weights of the PLAs produced with Ti(O-i-Pr)4 and Ti(O-i-Pr)4/SiO2 under the same conditions were 15,100 and 36,300g/mol, respectively. It is thought that the higher l-lactide/Ti ratio is responsible for the higher molecular weights. The total amount of titanium of the catalyst was not used as only a partial amount of titanium on the silica surface was used for the polymerization in the case of the supported catalysts. The molecular weight increase of the polymers made using the supported catalyst is valuable from a commercial point of view. The molecular weight distributions of the produced PLA with both TiCl(O-i-Pr)3/SiO2 and Ti(O-i-Pr)4/SiO2 were narrower than those with the homogeneous catalyst (Runs 2 and 4). It is currently unclear why the transesterification reaction might be restrained, but it may be due to changes of the environment of the active sites during the immobilization. Table 3 shows the melting temperatures of the PLAs produced with the homogeneous and heterogeneous titanium alkoxide catalysts. The T m values of the polymers produced by the supported catalysts were around 165°C, which are 5–10°C higher than those produced by the homogeneous catalyst. It is thought that the higher molecular weight of the polymer produced by supported catalyst resulted in these differences in the melting temperatures. 4 Conclusions Silica-supported catalysts were prepared by reacting TiCl(O-i-Pr)3 and Ti(O-i-Pr)4 with pretreated silica. Lactide polymerization was conducted with silica-supported titanium alkoxide catalysts in a different catalyst system. It was observed that the immobilization of titanium alkoxides did not affect the morphology of the support. The morphologies of TiCl(O-i-Pr)3/SiO2 and Ti(O-i-Pr)4/SiO2 catalysts were comparatively regular and spherical. The activity of the supported catalysts was lower than that of the homogeneous catalysts. However, the final conversion using the supported catalysts was higher than that of the homogeneous catalysts. The mass transfer limitation of the monomer may be responsible for the discrepancy between the catalytic activity and the conversion. Both TiCl(O-i-Pr)3/SiO2 and Ti(O-i-Pr)4/SiO2 catalysts produced similar PLA molecular weights and PDIs. The silica-supported titanium alkoxide catalysts produced superior molecular weight, melting point, and final conversion to PLA. The molecular weights of PLA produced with the silica-supported catalysts were 2.5 times higher than those produced with the homogeneous catalysts.

A series of solution polymerizations of l-lactide were conducted with homogeneous alkoxide catalysts and silica-supported titanium alkoxide catalysts to compare their catalytic activity and the characteristics of the polylactide (PLA) produced. The conversion of l-lactide with the silica-supported alkoxide catalysts was higher than that with homogeneous catalysts even though the catalyst activity was low. In addition, the PLA produced using silica-supported alkoxide catalysts had a higher molecular weight and T m than those produced with the homogeneous catalyst.",
