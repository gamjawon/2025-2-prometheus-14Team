The NH3 over-activation would be effectively inhibited when NH3 was activated on support, thus it can significantly suppress the formation of N2O. The problems of easily inactivated by SO2 poisoning and high N2O formation for MnOx based catalysts hinder its application in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with NH3. The SO2 poisoning mechanism has been well demonstrated, but the N2O formation mechanism was still controversial due to previous limited study. Herein, MnO2 supported on MOx (Mn/M, M = Al, Si and Ti) were prepared by wet impregnation method to investigate the carrier effect on the formation of N2O. Although all of selected supports had a large amount of surface acid sites, only forming strong active-support interaction can separate the activation sites of NH3 and NO + O2. Accordingly, the activation of NH3 and NO + O2 on MnTi was respectively occurred on TiO2 and MnO2, but both NH3 and NO + O2 was activated on MnO2 over MnAl and MnSi samples. The over-activation (NH2 dissociated into NH) of NH3 would be effectively inhibited when NH3 activation was occurred on TiO2, thus it can significantly suppress the formation of N2O. In contrast, the NH3 species would sharply decompose into NH on MnO2 and then lead to the high amount of N2O. Finally, we proposed some methods that might effectively improve the selectivity of MnOx-based catalysts. Keywords N2O Support Active-support interaction MnOx NH3-SCR 1 Introduction NOₓ produced from utilization of coal, diesel and gasoline can cause a series of environmental issues, such as acid rains, photochemical smog and ozone depletion [1]. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOₓ by NH3 over commercial V2O5-WO3(MoO3)/TiO2 catalysts is a widely used technology in removing NOₓ from large coal-fired boilers [2]. However, the problems of high toxicity of V2O5 and high activity temperature window (320–400 °C) still exist in their practical application [3,4]. The temperature of fuel gas from small and medium coal-fired boilers is always below 300 °C, thus a preheater should be added before NH3-SCR denitrification system based on V2O5-WO3(MoO3)/TiO2 catalysts, which will lead to a high energy consumption. Therefore, researchers have been working hard to develop highly active catalysts at low temperature. Nowadays, the transition metal oxides (FeOx [5–7], CuO [8], NiO [9], CrOx [10,11], CoOx [12–14] and MnOx [15–17]) and rare earth metal oxides (CeO2 [18–20]) based catalysts have been studied. Among them, MnOx based catalysts have obtained much attention due to their features of high activity at low temperature, low cost and environment friendly [15–17]. Although MnOx-based catalysts exhibits excellent low temperature activity, the problems of easily inactivated by SO2 poisoning and high N2O formation hinder its industrial application. The widely accepted SO2 poisoning mechanism of MnOx-based catalysts is resulted from two aspects. One is the formation of ammonium salt ((NH4)2SO4 and/or NH4HSO4) that cover the active sites of catalyst. The another one might be ascribed to the manganese salt (MnSO4, Mn2(SO4)2, Mn(SO4)2, etc.) resulted from the reaction between SO2 and Mn species, which completely not worked in low temperature NH3-SCR. N2O, as an byproduct of NH3-SCR, is a strong greenhouse gas. The formation mechanism of N2O during NH3-SCR of NOx is complex and controversial. From the previous study, N2O may be resulted from the reaction of SNCR (1) and NH3 oxidation (2) [21–23]. (1) 4NO+3O2+4NH3→4N2O+6H2O (2) 2NH3+2O2→N2O+3H2O Both two above formation route, the N element in N2O is derived from NH3. Yang [22] et al. and Wang [24] et al. proposed that NO can significantly increase the formation of N2O during NH3-SCR, which inferred that the N2O mainly generate due to NH3-SNCR (1). From the studies of Hao’s [25] and Li’s [21,22,26] group, the over-activated NH3 species are resulted to the high content of N2O. Accordingly, how to control the degree of NH3 activation is a feasible way to improve the N2 selectivity of MnOx based catalysts. Xin et al. prepared bifunctional Vα-MnOx catalyst and proposed that NH3 was activated to NH2 on Mn2O3 species and then transferred to the surface of Mn2V2O7, thus can effectively convert NOx to N2 [27]. Tang et al. compared the catalytic performance of β-MnO2 and α-Mn2O3 and pointed out that β-MnO2 possesses much higher active oxygen species, thus NH3 can be over-activated on β-MnO2 then lead to the formation of high content N2O [25]. Furthermore, it is widely reported that metal (such as Ti [28], Sm [29], Ga [30] and Fe [31]) modification can improve the catalytic activity and N2 selectivity of MnOx catalysts. For MnOx supported catalysts, they always exhibit higher catalytic performance than MnOx because supports can improve the MnOx dispersion and surface acidity [32–34]. Nevertheless, they still show high N2O selectivity, especially when the reaction temperature is higher than 200 °C. Supported catalysts are typical catalysts applied in for industry because of their large scale and mature craftsmanship. Thus, targeted solving the problem of low N2 selectivity for MnOx supported catalysts can accelerate their industrial application. Up to now, many methods have been employed to inhibit the formation of N2O on MnOx supported catalysts. Yang et al. studied the promotion of Mo addition on MnOx/γ-Al2O3 and concluded that Mo can promote the formation of Mn3+ in catalyst and then improve NH3 adsorption capacity, so the N2 selectivity of MnOx/γ-Al2O3 was enhanced [35]. Moreover, Fe and W modification is reported as effective way to increase the catalytic activity and N2 selectivity of MnOx/TiO2 catalysts [36,37]. Although so much research has been reported, none of them have conducted in-depth analysis of N2O generation. In this study, MnOx was supported on MOx (Mn/M, M = Al, Si and Ti) by wet impregnation method to investigate the carrier effect on the formation of N2O. Combined characterizations and catalytic activity test results, we try to demonstrate the key of N2O formation mechanism from a perspective of carrier effect. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Materials Titanium oxide (TiO2, Aladdin, 99.8 % metal basis, anatase, 2–25 nm, hydrophilic), Aluminum oxide (Al2O3, Aladdin, 99.99 % metal basis, γ phase 10 nm), Silica fumed (SiO2, Aladdin, hydrophilic), Manganese nitrate solution (Mn(NO3)2, Aladdin, AR, 50 wt% in H2O), deionized water (self-made). All chemicals were used without pretreated. 2.1.2 Catalyst preparation MnOx supported on MOx (MnM, M = Al, Si and Ti) catalysts were prepared by a traditional wet impregnation method. Generally, a certain of 50 wt% Mn(NO3)2 solution (calculated by the mass content of MnO2 /(MnO2+MOx) = 20 %) and 2 g MOx were added into 100 mL deionized water. Then, the solvent was evaporated by heating under vigorous stirring. The remaining solid was dried at 120 °C and calcined at 400 °C for 4 h. Finally, MnM catalysts were obtained. 2.2 Characterization The structure and composition of samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction measurements (XRD Purkinje General Instrument Cu, Ltd, China, XD–3), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET Quadrasorb-S1, Quantachrome, USA), Field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Quanta 250 F) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI–5000C, ESCA). Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) experiment was performed at chemisorption analyzer (Quantachrome, thermal conductivity detector (TCD)). 100 mg sample (pre-purged with He at 300 °C for 30 min), 60 mL·min–1 gas flow rate and 10 °C min–1 heating rate was adopted during each experiment. In the NH3-TDP experiment, the sample was pre-treated with 2 vol%NH3/N2 for 60 min and then purged with He for 30 min at 50 °C. Subsequently, TPD was carried by raising the temperature to 600 °C. For H2-TPR experiment, it performed by heating the pre-treated sample to 800 °C at 10 vol%H2/N2 flow. 2.3 Catalytic activity test The NH3-SCR de-NO x performance at 120–300 °C of samples (300 mg, 40–80 mesh) were evaluated in a quartz fixed-bed reactor (i,d, 5 mm) under atmospheric pressure. 200 mL·min–1 (space velocity of 60,000 h–1) typical reactant gas composed of 500 ppm NO, 500 ppm NH3 and 6 % O2 (N2 as the balance gas) was utilized. The concentration of NO, NO2, N2O, NH3 and O2 in the inlet and outlet gas was measured by an infrared gas analyzer (Sensonic IR–1). The related calculation equations as followed: NO x (x = 1 and 2) conversion (%) = ([NO x ] in–[NO x ] out)/ [NO x ] in× 100 % NO conversion (%) = (NO in–NO out)/ NO in× 100 % NH3 conversion (%) = (NH3 in–NH3 out)/ NH3 in× 100 % N2O from NH3 oxidation (ppm) = (NH3 conversion- NO x conversion)/100×NH3 in/2 3 Results and discussion 3.1 structure analysis Fig. 1 shows the diffraction patterns of samples. TiO2 displayed typical diffraction peaks of anatase phase (PDF#21–1272). Only a broad peak at 15–30○ could be observed in the spectrum of SiO2, proposing that it possessed amorphous structure. The peaks of Al2O3 were well agreed with the γ phase Al2O3 (PDF#79–1558). After impregnating MnOx, the diffraction peak of supports decreased obviously and some new peaks at 28.7○, 37.5○ and 56.8○ due to MnO2 (PDF#72–1984) were emerged. These phenomena might be ascribed to that the high loading content of MnOx lead to the formation of MnO2 crystal and decrease the peak intensity of supports. The MnO2 content in MnO2/MOx catalysts was measured by ICP-AES and their value were 19.6 %, 20.1 % and 20.3 % for MnTi, MnAl and MnSi, respectively. These values were similar with the added stoichiometry, suggesting that MnO2/MOx catalysts prepared as expected. The BET data are summarized in Table 1 . The specific surface area of supports decreased in the order of SiO2>Al2O3>TiO2. Compared to supports, MnO2/MOx catalysts showed a lower specific surface area but still displayed a same subsequence. The specific surface area of supports had an important influence on the dispersion of impregnated MnO2, so the MnO2 dispersion was analysis by EDS mapping. As shown in Fig S1, the Mn species on MnSi (purple dots) and MnAl (red dots) samples was highly dispersed on the supports than that on MnTi samples, indicating that the degree of MnO2 dispersion was positive related with the specific surface area of supports. In other words, the higher surface area of supports could contribute to the dispersion of MnO2. 3.2 surface properties analysis The surface component and their valence was analysis by XPS and the results are presented in Fig. 2 , Table 2 and Fig S2. As displayed in Fig. 2a, the XPS peak of Mn species was composited with Mn2p1/2 and Mn2p3/2. After fitting with Lorentzian-Gaussian sum function, Mn2p3/2 peak could be divided into three peaks of Mn4+, Mn3+ and satellite [38]. As listed in Table 2, Mn species existed mainly in the form of Mn4+, which was corresponding to the XRD results that observing MnO2 phase. Additionally, the MnO2 ratio on the MnAl was twice time more than on MnSi but far less than that on MnTi, inferring that the degree of MnO2 dispersion in an order of MnSi > MnAl > MnTi. This result further confirmed the EDS-mapping results. From Fig S2a-c, Ti2p peak had a shift to lower binding energy and no peak shift could be found in the peak position of Al2p and Si2p. These indicated the strong active-support interaction only form between loaded MnO2 and TiO2 in MnTi. Fig. 2b presents the O1s XPS spectra of MnO2/MOx samples. The peak of Oα and Oβ were assigned to the surface chemisorbed oxygen species (surface hydroxyl and chemisorbed oxygen molecule) and lattice oxygen over samples, respectively. SiO2 supports have big specific surface area of 344 m2 g–1 and rich surface hydroxyl group, thus MnSi displayed small Oβ peak (MnO2 was highly dispersed) but strong Oα peak. Fig. 3 shows the H2-TPR patterns of the samples. No reduction peak could be found in the spectra of SiO2 and Al2O3 because of their high stability. TiO2 exhibited a small broad peak located at 550–700 °C, which was assigned to the reduction of Ti4+. Obviously, two peaks could be observed in MnO2/MOx samples. The first peak (peak 1) could be ascribed to the reduction of Mn4+ to Mn3+ and the second peak was due to the reduction of Mn3+ to Mn2+ [39,40]. From the peak position, we knew that the oxidative ability of Mn4+ species over MnTi was much stronger than that on MnSi and MnAl because it displayed the lowest reduction temperature. As discussed in EDS-mapping and XPS, the dispersion degree of MnO2 species on samples followed an order of MnSi > MnAl > MnTi. The MnO2 with higher dispersion might exhibit stronger oxidative ability, which could explain that MnSi displayed a low temperature reduced Mn4+ species than MnAl [41]. For the reason that the Mn4+ species on MnTi possess strongest oxidative ability, it might be ascribed to the formation of strong active-support interaction (as discussed in XPS). Fig. 4 displays the NH3-TPD patterns of samples. SiO2 displayed a broad NH3 desorption peak at 120–300 °C, which was assigned to the desorption of weak adsorbed NH3 species. As motioned in materials and O1s XPS, a large amount of Si−OH species (Bronsted acid site) existed on SiO2, thus the weak adsorbed NH3 species might be NH4 + species adsorbed on Si−OH species [42,43]. For Al2O3 sample, a broad peak located at 250–450 °C attributed to strong adsorbed NH3 species was observed. As to TiO2, both peaks due to weak and strong adsorbed NH3 species could be found. As loaded MnO2 species, the NH3 adsorption capacity was significantly increased. As reported in previous study, Mn4+ species and Mn−OH on the MnO2 are the acid sites for NH3 adsorption [30,44,45]. Hence, the improved NH3 adsorption capacity could be attributed to new acid sites due to MnO2 loading. Based on above analysis, NH3 species could absorb both on the supports and MnO2. 3.3 Catalytic performance evaluation Fig. 5 shows the catalytic activity test results of samples. As shown in Fig. 5a, all supports displayed no catalytic activity in NH3-SCR of NOx at the temperature range of 120–300 °C. MnOx/MOx catalysts displayed high NOx conversion and MnTi always presented the highest NOx conversion. Notably, the NOx conversion of MnO2/MOx catalysts was decreased with the ramping the temperature when reaction temperature was higher than 180 °C. As shown in Fig. 5b and Fig. 5e, however, no obvious change could be found in the NO conversion and outlet NO concentration on MnO2/MOx catalysts above 180 °C, thus the decreased NOx conversion might be resulted from the formation of NO2 (As shown in Fig. 5f). By comparing the Fig. 5a and Fig. 5c, we could find that the NH3 conversion was always higher than NOx conversion, indicating that some of NH3 was converted into N2O or NOx. When the reaction temperature was lower than 180 °C, the NO conversion was less than NOx conversion and no obvious NO2 concentration change could be seen in outlet. Accordingly, the higher NH3 conversion might be due to the conversion of NH3 into N2O via the route of 2NH3+2O2→N2O+3H2O. In order to investigate the resource of N2O, we recorded the outlet N2O concentration and calculated the N2O concentration from NH3 oxidation. As displayed in Fig. 5d, the N2O was mainly resulted from SNCR when reaction temperature below 240 °C, but NH3 oxidation was mainly contributed to the formation of N2O when reaction temperature above 240 °C. It was worth noting that the N2O concentration decreased when reaction temperature was higher than 240 °C, which could be assigned to the decomposition of N2O into N2 [46]. Although we cannot calculate the N balance in the appeal results due to the lack of product data (such as N2O5 and N2), the analysis based on the existing results are of great reference value. 3.4 Support effect analysis on N2O formation From the EDS-mapping and XPS results, we can find the dispersion degree of MnO2 species on MnO2/MOx catalysts followed the order of MnSi > MnAl > MnTi, which was strongly related to the specific surface area of support. Generally, the higher dispersed MnO2 species possess better oxidation ability [41]. However, the oxidation ability of MnO2 on MnTi was stronger than that on MnSi and MnAl (as discussed in H2-TPR) because strong active-support interaction was form between MnO2 and TiO2. The stronger oxidation ability of MnO2 species was benefited to the NO oxidation into NO2, which could promote NH3-SCR reaction via “fast SCR” route. Thus, MnTi exhibited a much higher catalytic activity than MnSi and MnAl (shown in Fig. 5a). For the N2 selectivity, it was worth noting that the formation of N2O during NH3-SCR over MnTi was far less than that over the other two catalysts. As reported in previous study [21–23] and discussed in our catalytic performance analysis, the formation of N2O was resulted from NH3 oxidation and SNCR. If the NH3 was activated on MnO2 species, the higher oxidizing MnO2 would lead to the over-activation of NH3 and N2O formation. This can well explain the reason that MnSi presented a much higher N2O selectivity than MnAl. However, the lowest amounts of N2O were detected during NH3-SCR reaction on MnTi in spite of the fact that it possessed the highest oxidizing MnO2. Therefore, the NH3 activation on MnTi might occur on the TiO2. Based on above discussion, we devoted MnO2/MOx into two types and proposed the possible reaction routes on MnO2/MOx. As shown in Fig. 6 , MnO2 can form interaction with Support-I (such as TiO2) but just dispersed on Support-II (such as Al2O3 and SiO2). During NH3-SCR reaction, the activation of NH3 and NO + O2 was respectively occurred on support and MnO2 of MnO2/Support-I. Although the strong active-support interaction can promote the activation of NH3 into NH2 on Support-I, the over-activation (NH2 dissociated into NH) might be inhibited because its activation energy was much higher than the dissociation of NH3 into NH2 [47,48]. At that time, NO + O2 was sharply activated on MnO2 species. Therefore, the NH3-SCR reaction on MnO2/Support-I was very fast. For MnO2/Support-II catalysts, both NH3 and NO + O2 activation was occurred on MnO2, so their activation would be inhibited due to competitive adsorption effect. Furthermore, the over-activation of NH3 could occur easily because the high oxidation ability of well dispersed MnO2 species. These would lead to the formation of N2O via SNCR and NH3 oxidation by O2 route. In order to suppress the formation of N2O during NH3-SCR reaction over MnOx based catalysts, therefore, we should separate the activation sites of NH3 and NO + O2 by selecting the support-I type as supports and/or modifying them by some species with strong surface acid sites (such as WO3, MoO3, SnO2 and solid acid species). 4 Conclusions Based on above study, we can draw that the support of MnOx based catalysts had a significant effect on their catalytic performance. The high specific surface area of supports was benefited to dispersing the impregnated MnO2, so the dispersion of MnO2 over MnO2/MOx followed the subsequence of MnSi > MnAl > MnTi. However, TiO2 support can form strong active-support interaction with impregnated MnO2, thus the reducibility of MnO2 of MnTi was stronger than that of MnSi and MnAl. Furthermore, strong active-support interaction induced the shift of NH3 activation sites from the Mn site to the Ti site. This change effectively inhibited the over-activation of NH3, so the amount of N2O formation on MnTi was much less than that on MnSi and MnAl. Through this study, we could concluded that separating NH3 and NO + O2 activation sites might be an effective method to improve the selectivity of MnOx based catalysts.

        "dc:description": "The problems of easily inactivated by SO2 poisoning and high N2O formation for MnOx based catalysts hinder its application in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with NH3. The SO2 poisoning mechanism has been well demonstrated, but the N2O formation mechanism was still controversial due to previous limited study. Herein, MnO2 supported on MOx (Mn/M, M = Al, Si and Ti) were prepared by wet impregnation method to investigate the carrier effect on the formation of N2O. Although all of selected supports had a large amount of surface acid sites, only forming strong active-support interaction can separate the activation sites of NH3 and NO + O2. Accordingly, the activation of NH3 and NO + O2 on MnTi was respectively occurred on TiO2 and MnO2, but both NH3 and NO + O2 was activated on MnO2 over MnAl and MnSi samples. The over-activation (NH2 dissociated into NH) of NH3 would be effectively inhibited when NH3 activation was occurred on TiO2, thus it can significantly suppress the formation of N2O. In contrast, the NH3 species would sharply decompose into NH on MnO2 and then lead to the high amount of N2O. Finally, we proposed some methods that might effectively improve the selectivity of MnOx-based catalysts.",
