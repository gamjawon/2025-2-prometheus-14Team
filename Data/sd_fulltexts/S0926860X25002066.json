Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University Nagoya 464-8603 Japan Platinum group metal (PGM)-free and Cr-free automotive three-way catalyst (TWC) was examined using two types of base-metal oxides for hydrocarbon preferential oxidation (HC-PROX) and NO reduction by CO in tandem configuration. MnOx-based binary mixed metal oxides (X1Mn2, X = Ba, Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Ni, Zn, Zr) were investigated for the design of HC-PROX catalysts. Mg1Mn2 achieved both high propene oxidation activity and low CO oxidation activity, and the catalyst phase was determined as MgMn2O4 having the spinel structure. A tandem TWC composed of MgMn2O4 for HC-PROX and CuCo2O4 for NO-CO reaction showed comparable NO reduction activity and higher oxidation activity of propene and CO compared to Rh/ZrO2 as a benchmark. In-situ FTIR study clarified that the suppression of CO oxidation over MgMn2O4 is caused by strongly adsorbed acetate and formate on the catalyst surface.

TWCs are composed of platinum group metals (PGMs, Pt, Pd, and Rh) as essential active components for the catalytic activity [1–5], and of supports and promoters which strongly enhance the catalytic activity and durability [6–10]. Due to the limited resources and high and unstable prices of PGM, the development of PGM-free or PGM-saved TWCs is strongly desired [11–32]. Several papers about the development of PGM-free TWC have reported that very poor activity for NO reduction is one of the serious problems. Although NiFe2O4 shows the highest NO reduction activity among base metal oxide TWC catalysts [21], the rate of NO reduction is only 1/8 of that of Rh/ZrO2. In the previous paper, we clarified that the reason for the low NO reduction activity of base metal oxides is surface poisoning with oxygenated hydrocarbons derived from partial oxidation of HC, such as acetate [33]. The lower concentration of HC results in a higher NO reduction activity, which suggests the strongly adsorbed hydrocarbon-derived species suppress the reduction of NO by inhibiting the adsorption of NO and CO [34]. Based on the above findings, we have proposed the following breakthrough. The system is called a \"tandem TWC\", which is composed of an upstream HC-preferential oxidation (HC-PROX) catalyst and a downstream NO-CO reaction catalyst [34]. The most serious problem in metal oxide catalysts is the suppression of the NO-CO reaction in the presence of hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are partially oxidized with O2 to form oxygenated species, such as acetate or formate [33]. Therefore, the NOx reduction activity depends on the competitive adsorption of CO and oxygenated hydrocarbons on the catalyst surface. As for precious metal catalysts, CO is strongly adsorbed on metal surfaces and NO reduction by CO successfully proceeds. As for metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, oxygenated hydrocarbons are strongly absorbed on metal oxides due to acid-base interaction, hence NO reduction by CO is suppressed. To avoid the suppression of the NO-CO reaction by oxygenates, two reactions of HC-O2 and NO-CO should be separated. In the tandem TWC, the upstream HC-PROX catalyst selectively oxidizes HC with O2, then NO and CO pass through the upstream catalyst, and the reduction of NO by CO effectively proceeds on the downstream catalyst without the negative effect of hydrocarbons. The reaction schemes in a \"tandem TWC\" can be written as follows: NO, CO, HC, O 2 → Upstream HC-PROX Catalyst → NO, CO, CO 2 , H 2 O NO, CO, CO2, H2O → Downstream NO-CO reaction catalyst → N 2 , CO 2 , CO2, H2O Although several base metal oxides are known to be active for the NO-CO reaction, a high-performance HC-PROX (Hydrocarbon preferential oxidation) catalyst is strongly required as an upstream catalyst for a tandem TWC. We presented that the tandem TWC composed of ZnCr2O4 for HC-PROX and CuCo2O4 for NO-CO reaction showed comparable NO reduction activity to Rh/ZrO2, which is a typical component of TWC for NO reduction [34]. The high TWC performance of the proposed tandem TWC is owing to the high propene oxidation activity and the low CO oxidation activity of ZnCr2O4 [35,36], however, the use of Cr is a serious drawback. Since TWCs are sometimes exposed to oxidized atmospheres at high temperatures, ZnCr2O4 cannot be applied because of the possible diffusion of highly toxic hexavalent chromium (Cr6 +). A PGM-free and Cr-free TWC is strongly desired. So far, we have investigated the highly efficient HC-PROX catalysts using the 4th-period transient metal oxide catalysts and reported that V2O5/TiO2 and MnFe2O4 are the candidates for HC-PROX catalysts [37,38]. However, V2O5/TiO2 and MnFe2O4 showed lower activity for HC combustion than ZnCr2O4 and Rh-based catalysts, especially around 300 ºC. More effective HC-PROX catalysts are desired to promote the NO reduction activity of a tandem TWC at lower temperatures. Through preliminary-performed screening for competitive oxidation of propene and CO, manganese oxides (MnO2 and Mn2O3) preferentially oxidized propene in the presence of CO, though the oxidation activity was low. Since the mixed metal oxides having the spinel structure, such as ZnCr2O4 and MnFe2O4, showed high activity for propane oxidation, suppressing CO oxidation, it can be expected to enhance the hydrocarbon oxidation activity by adding the second elements to manganese oxides (MnOx). This study aims to design highly active HC-PROX catalysts using MnOx-based catalysts. MgMn2O4 showed the best HC-PROX activity among MnOx-based catalysts. When a tandem TWC composed of MgMn2O4 as an upstream HC-PROX catalyst and CuCo2O4 as a downstream NO-CO reaction catalyst showed comparable NO reduction activity and higher HC and CO oxidation activity compared to Rh/ZrO2. Furthermore, the mechanistic study was also performed to clarify the reason why hydrocarbon is more selectively oxidized than CO on MgMn2O4. 2 Experimental MnOx-based binary mixed oxide catalysts (abbreviated to X1Mn2, X = Ba, Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Ni, Zn, Zr) were prepared by the reverse strike coprecipitation method. Metal nitrate salts, Ba(NO3)2, Ca(NO3)2∙4 H2O, Co(NO3)2∙6 H2O, Cu(NO3)2∙3 H2O, Fe(NO3)3∙9 H2O, Mg(NO3)2∙6 H2O, Ni(NO3)2∙6 H2O, Zn(NO3)2∙6 H2O, and ZrO(NO3)2∙2 H2O were used as precursors. Mn(NO3)2∙6 H2O and a second metal (X) nitrate were dissolved in 100 mL distilled water in an atomic ratio of X/Mn = 1/2, and the solution was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The obtained aqueous nitrate solution was added dropwise to a 1 M NaOH aqueous solution (pH = 13), and a brown precipitate was obtained. After 1 h of stirring, the precipitate was filtered and washed with hot water at 60 °C several times until the pH of the filtrate became neutral to completely remove NaOH in the precipitate. The obtained precursor was dried overnight at 80 °C and calcined at 500 °C for 3 h in air. The catalyst without the second metal X (abbreviated to Mn) was prepared similarly without the addition of the second metal nitrate. A series of Mg-Mn mixed oxide catalysts having the Mg/Mn ratios of 1/5, 1/2, 2/1, and 5/1 were also prepared. CuOx-based catalysts are known to be effective for NO-CO reactions [39–49], and CuCo2O4 was selected as the downstream catalyst of the tandem TWC. CuCo2O4 was prepared by a reverse strike co-precipitation method, as previously reported [34]. The obtained precursor was dried overnight at 80 °C and calcined at 500 °C for 3 h in air. Rh/ZrO2 was prepared using a conventional impregnation method with aqueous solutions of rhodium (III) nitrate, n-hydrate (35.36 %, Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd). The aqueous nitrate solutions (Rh 1 wt%) were impregnated with ZrO2 (JRC-ZRO-3, 94.4 m2 g-1, supplied by the reference catalyst committee, Catalyst Society of Japan) followed by evaporation of excess water at 60 °C, drying at 80 °C, and finally calcination at 500 °C for 3 h in air. The structure of the catalysts was evaluated by using a laboratory-scale XRD (Rigaku MiniFlex diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at 30 kV and 15 mA). BET surface area was measured using Microtrac MRB BELSORP mini II after the pretreatment of 0.1 g of a sample at 400 ºC. In-situ FTIR spectra were measured using JASCO FT/IR-6100, connecting with a vacuum heating diffuse reflectance measurement unit DR-650A. For a fair comparison of the spectra, the sample powder was ground as evenly as possible. The sample was at first pretreated at 400 ºC in a flow of 0.6 % O2/Ar for 15 min. After cooling the temperature to 200 ºC, the background spectrum was measured. In-situ FTIR spectra were measured in a flow of a mixture of gas (1000 ppm NO, 1000 ppC C3H6, 4000 ppm CO, 6000 ppm O2, and balance Ar), raising the reaction temperature stepwise from 196 to 266 ºC. The real temperature of the catalyst bed was determined by sticking a thermocouple under a flow of the reaction mixture gas in a separate experiment. NH3-TPD (Temperature Programmed Desorption) profiles were measured using Microtracbel BELCAT 2. A 50 mg sample was pretreated in a flow of pure O2 (50 L min−1) at 400 ºC for 15 min, cooled down to 100 ºC, exposed in a flow of 1 % NH3/He (50 mL min−1) for 15 min, purged in a flow of He for 30 min, then a TPD profile was taken in a flow of pure He (35 mL min−1) with the heating rate of 10 ºC min−1. The HC-PROX and TWC performances were evaluated by a conventional fixed bed flow reactor under a flow of 1000 ppm NO, 1000 ppm propene, 4000 ppm CO, 6000 ppm O2, and Ar as a balance. For the HC-PROX, a catalyst (17.5 mg) was placed into a U-shaped quartz tube with a 4 mm inner diameter and 150 mm length. A model exhaust gas at stoichiometric composition (1000 ppm of NO, 1000 ppm of propene, 4000 ppm of CO, 6000 ppm of O2, and balance Ar) was fed to the catalysts with a total flow rate of 60 mL min–1 (gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) ≈ 200,000 mL g–1 h–1). The gas cylinders were supplied by Taiyo Nippon Sanso JFP Corporation, as 1.02 % NO/Ar, 1.01 % propene/Ar, 4.99 % CO/Ar, 2.99 % O2/Ar, and pure Ar (99.995％). The catalysts were pretreated in a flow of 6000 ppm O2/Ar at 400 ºC for 15 min. The activity test was carried out from 200 to 400 ºC in 50 ºC increments. For the TWC reaction, an HC-PROX catalyst (17.5 mg) was placed upstream of the U-shaped quartz tube, and a NO-CO reaction catalyst (17.5 mg) was placed downstream of the U-shaped quartz tube. The steady-state activity was measured using a multi-gas analyzer (HORIBA VA-3003 and VS-3004) for NO/CO/CO2 and a gas chromatograph (Agilent Model 490 Micro GC, equipped with MS-5A and PoraPLOT Q columns, and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD)) for propene and N2O. The propene conversion, the CO conversion, and the O2 selectivity were calculated according to the following Eqs. (1), (2), and (3) [50–52]. The O2 selectivity means the fraction of O2 contribution to propene oxidation per the oxidation of both propene and CO. When only propene is selectively oxidized, the O2 selectivity becomes 100 %. (1) Propene conversion % = ( Propene in − Propene out ) × 100 Propene in (2) CO conversion % = ( CO in − CO out ) × 100 CO in (3) O 2 selectivity % = 9 × 1000 × ( Propene conversion ) × 100 9 × 1000 × ( Propene conversion ) + 1 × 4000 × ( CO conversion ) 3 Results and discussion 3.1 HC-PROX over MnOx-based binary mixed oxide catalysts BET surface area and XRD patterns of the obtained catalysts are shown in Table S1 and Fig. S1, respectively. The surface areas range from 15.9 m2 g-1 (Ba1Mn2) to 141.9 m2 g-1 (Zr1Mn2). The XRD pattern of pure Mn oxide was a mixture of Mn2O3 (Pbca) and Mn3O4 (I41/amd). Ba1Mn2, Co1Mn2, Cu1Mn2, Ni1Mn2, and Zn1Mn2 indicated patterns of Mn3O4 (I41/amd) having spinel structure. Ba1Mn2 and Mg1Mn2 also showed weak patterns of the spinel structure. The competitive oxidation of propene and CO in a flow of NO-propene-CO-O2 mixture was performed using the prepared X1Mn2 catalysts. The conversions of propene, CO, and NO as a function of temperature are presented in Fig. S2. It should be noted that X1Mn2 catalysts exhibit negligible activity for NO reduction below 300 ºC. An HC-PROX catalyst requires high propene oxidation activity but low CO oxidation activity because it is necessary to supply CO to the downstream catalyst as a reductant of NO. Fig. 1 compares the propene conversion, the CO conversion, and the O2 selectivity to propene at 250 ºC. Ca1Mn2, Ni1Mn2, and Cu1Mn2 showed very high activity for propene oxidation, but these catalysts also showed high CO oxidation activity, indicating these catalysts are not appropriate for HC-PROX. On Zr1Mn2, Ba1Mn2, and Cu1Mn2, the conversion of CO oxidation was higher than that of propene. On Co1Mn2, Zn1Mn2, Mg1Mn2, and Fe1Mn2, the propene conversion was higher than that of CO. While the O2 selectivity of Co1Mn2, Zn1Mn2 was below 90 %, that of Mg1Mn2 and Fe1Mn2 exceeded 90 %, which was comparable to ZnCr2O4 [34]. One of the controlling factors for the oxygen selectivity to propene can be speculated to acid-base property of MnOx-based catalysts. As shown in Fig. S3, NH3-TPD profiles of MnOx-based catalysts showed NH3 desorption at lower temperatures below 300 ºC and at higher temperatures above 450 ºC, which can be assigned to weak Bronsted acid sites and strong Lewis acid sites, respectively [53]. Especially, the desorption peak at higher temperature is characteristic of Mg1Mn2 and Fe1Mn2, which showed higher oxygen selectivity to propene. Furthermore, the desorbed amount of NH3 was roughly correlated to the oxygen selectivity to propene (Fig. S4). The results suggest that the stronger adsorption of propene on Lewis acid sites is one of the controlling factors for the hydrocarbon preferential oxidation over MnOx-based binary mixed metal oxides. Among MnOx-based catalysts, Mg1Mn2 and Fe1Mn2 showed sufficient oxygen selectivity to propene as an upstream HC-PROX catalyst for a tandem TWC, i.e., these catalysts can selectively consume HC and O2, passing CO to a downstream NO-CO reaction catalyst as a reductant of NO. Since Mg1Mn2 showed higher propene oxidation activity than Fe1Mn2, further studies are performed using Mg-Mn mixed oxide catalysts as a candidate for an HC-PROX catalyst. The effect of the Mg/Mn ratio on the HC-PROX performance of Mg-Mn-mixed oxide catalysts was examined. Although the propene conversion of Mg1Mn2 was below 60 % at 250ºC, nearly full conversion of HC is required for HC-PROX because the role of HC-PROX is to avoid poisoning of the downstream catalyst by hydrocarbon-derived species. Therefore, the catalytic performances of Mg-Mn-mixed oxide catalysts were evaluated at a higher temperature (300 ºC). Fig. 2 shows the conversion of propene and CO at 300ºC on Mg-Mn-mixed oxide catalysts having a Mg/Mn ratio from 5/1–1/5. Clearly, the catalyst having a Mg/Mn ratio of 1/2 showed the best propene oxidation activity and the oxygen selectivity to propene. As shown in Fig. S4, Mg1Mn2 showed a slight decrease in oxidation activity in the presence of water vapor. The improvement of hydrothermal stability is a future challenge for Mg-Mn-mixed oxide catalysts. The XRD patterns of Mg-Mn-mixed oxide catalysts are shown in Fig. 3. Pure Mn-oxide was a mixture of Mn2O3 and Mn3O4. After the addition of Mg, Mg1Mn5 and Mg1Mn2 showed the patterns of MgMn2O4 having the spinel structure [54–59]. The chemical composition of Mg1Mn2 also agrees with MgMn2O4. Mg-rich samples (Mg2Mn1, Mg5Mn1) indicated broad diffraction lines of MgO. Since the crystal phase of Mg1Mn2, having the best HC-PROX activity, was assigned to the spinel type MgMn2O4, the catalyst Mg1Mn2 is renamed MgMn2O4, hereafter. In the next section, the TWC performance of a tandem TWC combined MgMn2O4 for HC-PROX and CuCo2O4 for NO-CO reaction was tested. 3.2 Tandem TWC composed of MgMn2O4 and CuCo2O4 Using MgMn2O4 for HC-PROX and CuCo2O4 for NO-CO reaction, a TWC reaction was performed. In the U-shaped glass tube reactor, MgMn2O4 was mounted upstream and CuCo2O4 was mounted downstream in a tandem layout. Fig. 4 shows the conversions of NO, propene, and CO over the tandem base metal oxide catalyst (MgMn2O4 + CuCo2O4). The catalytic performance of Rh/ZrO2 as a reference of PGM catalyst, and the previously reported tandem TWC (ZnCr2O4 + CuCo2O4) are also shown [34]. Compared with Rh/ZrO2 as a typical NO reduction component of PGM-based TWC, the tandem MgMn2O4 + CuCo2O4 catalyst showed comparable NO reduction activity. Below 250 ºC, the conversion of NO on the tandem TWC was slightly higher than Rh/ZrO2 and the tandem ZnCr2O4 + CuCo2O4. In the higher temperature region, the NO conversion reached 100 % at 350 ºC for Rh/ZrO2, 400 ºC for MgMn2O4 + CuCo2O4, and 500 ºC for ZnCr2O4 + CuCo2O4. The tandem MgMn2O4 + CuCo2O4 showed higher NO reduction activity than the previously reported CrOx-based tandem TWC, though it showed slightly lower NO reduction activity than Rh/ZrO2 at higher temperatures. As for the oxidation of CO and propene, the tandem MgMn2O4 + CuCo2O4 catalyst exceeded the performance of Rh/ZrO2. The N2 yield on the tandem MgMn2O4 + CuCo2O4 was also comparable to Rh/ZrO2 (Fig. S6). The tandem MgMn2O4 + CuCo2O4 showed good durability in the modulated A/F conditions (Fig. S7). It can be concluded that using MgMn2O4 as an HC-PROX catalyst, the possible design of PGM-free and Cr-free TWC was demonstrated. 3.3 Reason for the preferential propene oxidation in the presence of CO Why did MgMn2O4 preferentially oxidize propene while suppressing CO oxidation? The reason for the hydrocarbon preferential oxidation was investigated by comparing MgMn2O4 as an HC-PROX catalyst and CuMn2O4 (Cu1Mn2) as a typical CO preferential oxidation catalyst. Fig. 5 shows the effect of the presence of propene during CO oxidation. In the case of CuMn2O4, CO oxidation activity was not affected by the presence of propene. On the other hand, over MgMn2O4 as an HC-PROX catalyst, the introduction of propene into CO oxidation conditions strongly suppressed the CO oxidation activity, i.e., the CO conversion decreased from 60 % to 40 % under the competitive oxidation of propene and CO. It should be noted that the CO conversion steeply recovered when propane was removed in the feed gas. The results suggest the preferential oxidation of propene over MgMn2O4 is caused by the suppression of CO oxidation by reversible surface poisoning with propene or its derivatives. The suppression of CO oxidation by propene is also suggested from the kinetic experiment. Fig. S8 shows the dependence of the reaction rates of propene and CO on the propene concentration. On CuMn2O4, the reaction rates of propene and CO are almost independent of the propene concentration, and the reaction orders with respect to propene are nearly zero. In the case of MgMn2O4, on the other hand, the rate of CO oxidation was strongly suppressed as the propene concentration increased. The negative reaction order of CO oxidation with respect to the propene concentration indicates the inhibition of CO oxidation by strong adsorption of propene or its derivatives. Then the surface adsorption species were investigated by using in-situ FTIR. Fig. 6 shows the in-situ FTIR spectra of surface-adsorbed species during the competitive oxidation of propene and CO. The spectra were taken in the absence of NO to avoid surface nitrate contribution. On both the catalysts below 200ºC, the absorption bands were observed at 1565–1615 and 1440 cm−1, assignable to νas (COO) and νs (COO) of acetate [60–63], and at 1380–1390 cm−1 , assignable to formate (1360 cm-1) [64,65], respectively. These bands remained on MgMn2O4 at 260 ºC, while these bands were not observed on CuMn2O4 above 234 ºC. Considering the adsorption temperature of these species, it can be rationalized that the suppression of CO oxidation was caused by the strongly adsorbed acetate and formate. The strong adsorption of acidic acetate and formate on MgMn2O4 is reasonable because of the basic property of Mg [38]. Acetate is known to be an intermediate of both NO reduction by HC and propene oxidation by O2 on metal oxide catalysts [33,37,61,64–67]. Since MgMn2O4 showed poor activity for NO reduction, the observed oxygenated species are intermediates of propene oxidation by O2. Therefore, it can be concluded that the strong adsorption of acetate and formate enhances propene oxidation to CO2, blocking the adsorption and conversion of CO, and thus hydrocarbon preferential oxidation can be successfully proceeded on MgMn2O4. 4 Conclusion For the design of PGM-free and Cr-free TWC, a series of MnOx-based binary mixed oxides were examined as catalysts for hydrocarbon preferential oxidation (HC-PROX). MgMn2O4 selectively oxidized propene in the presence of CO. The comparable TWC activity to Rh/ZrO2 was obtained over the tandem TWC using MgMn2O4 as an upstream HC-PROX catalyst and CuCo2O4 as a downstream NO-CO reaction catalyst. A PGM-free and Cr-free tandem TWC was proposed. In-situ FTIR study revealed that the preferential oxidation of propene in the presence of CO was achieved by strong adsorption of acetate and formate, which suppress the adsorption of CO on the catalyst surface.

        "dc:description": "Platinum group metal (PGM)-free and Cr-free automotive three-way catalyst (TWC) was examined using two types of base-metal oxides for hydrocarbon preferential oxidation (HC-PROX) and NO reduction by CO in tandem configuration. MnOx-based binary mixed metal oxides (X1Mn2, X = Ba, Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Ni, Zn, Zr) were investigated for the design of HC-PROX catalysts. Mg1Mn2 achieved both high propene oxidation activity and low CO oxidation activity, and the catalyst phase was determined as MgMn2O4 having the spinel structure. A tandem TWC composed of MgMn2O4 for HC-PROX and CuCo2O4 for NO-CO reaction showed comparable NO reduction activity and higher oxidation activity of propene and CO compared to Rh/ZrO2 as a benchmark. In-situ FTIR study clarified that the suppression of CO oxidation over MgMn2O4 is caused by strongly adsorbed acetate and formate on the catalyst surface.",
