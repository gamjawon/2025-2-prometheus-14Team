Formylation of aryl and alkenyl iodides by palladium-ruthenium bimetallic catalysts Yoshihiko Misumi, Youichi Ishii and Masanobu Hidai** Department of Synthetic Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113 (Japan) (Received February 20, 1992; accepted May 26, 1992) Abstract The PdClz(PPh3)2-Ru3(CO),z bimetallic system exhibited higher catalytic activity for the formylation of aryl and alkenyl iodides than PdC12(PPh3)2 Or Ru3(CO),2 alone. Thus, in the formylation of iodobenzene (at 70 C for 1.5 h under 50:50 atm of CO:HZ), the yield of benzaldehyde by PdC12(PPh3)2-RU3(CO) 12 catalyst (Pd:Ru=1:2) was about four times as high as that by PdClz(PPh3)2 alone. Carbonyl complexes of other metals, such as MnACO),o, Co2(CO)$, Cr(CO)s, Fe(CO)6, Mo(CO)e and W(CO)e were ineffective as the second component of the catalyst. To clarify the mechanism of the synergistic effects, the reaction of Pdl(CO-p-Tol)(PPh3)Z with [HRu3(CO) ]- or [HRu(CO)j-, ruthenium hydride species known to be generated under the catalytic formylation conditions, was performed. The reaction rapidly proceeded at 40 C by dinuclear reductive elimination to form p-tolualdehyde, although the reaction with molecular hydrogen was very slow. These results strongly suggest that the improved catalytic activity of the Pd-Ru system is attributable to the high hydrogenolysis activity of in-situ-generated ruthenium hydride species. Introduction Homogeneous multimetallic catalysis has recently been recognized as a potential synthetic tool, since enhanced reaction rates and selectivities and hopefully new types of reactions are expected to arise from cooperative or successive participation of two or more metal atoms [ 1, 2 ]. Previously we reported the synergistic effects of cobalt and ruthenium on homologation of methanol [3] and hydroformylation of olefins such as cyclohexene [4, 5] and norbornene [6]. These findings were rationalized by assuming that a ruthenium hydride species behaves as an effective hydrogenolysis reagent toward an intermediate acylcobalt complex [ 7, 8 ]. Although such dinuclear reductive elimination reactions have attracted much attention in connection with the product-forming steps in catalytic processes [9-18], only a few *For Part 9, see [6]. \"Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved 2 reports have demonstrated that the dinuclear reductive elimination plays an important role in actual catalytic reactions [5, 18]. In order to obtain further information on the role of dinuclear reductive elimination reactions in catalysis and to develop a novel multimetallic catalyst, we turned our attention to a Pd-Ru catalyst system and found that this system exhibits a high catalytic activity in the formylation of aryl and alkenyl iodides. Here we wish to report the results of the catalytic reactions and related stoichiometric reactions between an acylpalladium complex and ruthenium hydride species. Results and discussion Catalytic fonnylation It is well known that palladium complexes such as PdC12(PPh3)2 are effective catalysts for the formylation of aryl and alkenyl halides [ 19 ]. This formylation was reported to require a reaction temperature of 80-150 C, and the reactions at 80 C were rather slow even though reactive alkenyl iodides were used as the substrates. Taking into consideration the fact that the rate-determining step of the palladium-catalyzed fonnylation of iodides seems to be the hydrogenolysis of acylpalladium intermediates (v iO infra), and that metal carbonyl hydrides effectively work as hydrogen donors in the dinuclear reductive elimination reactions to form aldehydes [ 7-14 [7-141, we expected that an improved bimetallic catalyst system for the fonnylation of iodides could be developed by combining a palladium complex with a metal carbonyl complex. From this viewpoint, we have examined the fonnylation of iodobenzene using various PdC12(PPh3)2-metal carbonyl catalysts (eqn. (1)): PdC1 (PPt3)2-metal carbonyl PhI + HZ + CO + NEt3 PhCHO + HNEt3I (1) The results are summarized in Table 1. The catalytic activity of PdC12(PPh3)2 alone at 70 C is low, and the yield of benzaldehyde after 1.5 h was only 17%. The metal carbonyls of Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Fe, Co and Ru have essentially no catalytic activity under these reaction conditions. Interestingly, when PdC12(PPh3)2 and Ru3(CO)12 were used in combination at a metal atomic ratio of 1:2, the yield of benzaldehyde became almost four times as high as that for PdC12(PPh3)2 only. Obviously the Pd-Ru bimetallic system showed a synergistic effect for the formylation of iodobenzene. However, other metal carbonyls did not work effectively as the second component of the bimetallic catalyst for this reaction. As shown in Fig. 1, the Ru/Pd ratio has a great effect on the activity of the Pd-Ru catalyst. The highest activity was achieved when the Ru/Pd ratio was 2 (atomic ratio). In the reactions where more Ru3(CO)12 was used, precipitation of Pd metal (identified by EPMA) was observed, and probably this lowered the yield of benzaldehyde. Addition of PPh3 to the catalyst system prevented the precipitation of Pd, but the yield was not improved. The Pd-Ru catalyst was effective for the formylation of various aryl and alkenyl iodides. As shown in Table 2, when aryl iodides were used, the yields 3 TABLE 1 Effects of various metal carbonyls on the palladium-catalyzed formylatione Run no. Mb Yield (%) (Conv.

However, no positive effect was observed in the formylation of bromobenzene. This is probably because the rate-determining step in the formylation of bromobenzene is the oxidative addition of bromobenzene to a palladium(0) complex, where there is no participation by any ruthenium species (vide infra). In the formylation of (Z)-3-iodohex-3-ene, the Pd-Ru catalyst showed not only higher catalytic activity but also a higher tendency to retain the stereochemistry around the C=C bond (Table 3). This tendency was more marked when the reaction was performed at lower temperatures. 4 TABLE 2 Formylation of various haloarenes by Pd or Pd-Ru catalysis' Run no.

Stoichiometric reactions between a palladium acyl complex and metal hyds It is known that under basic and hydrogen pressurized conditions Ru3(CO)12 is transformed into anionic hydride complexes such as [HRu(CO)4 [8, 20] and [HRu3(CO)1,]- [21], the latter being formed under much milder conditions (in THF at 65 C). In fact, when a benzene-triethylamine (6:1) solution of Ru3(CO)12 was kept in contact with HZ under conditions similar to those of the catalytic reactions (70 C, 40 atm CO, 40 atm H2, 1 h), the IR spectrum of the solution (2079.5 (w), 2060.2 (m), 2029.4 (s), 1998.5 (s), 1959.9 (m) cm-1) clearly showed the presence of [HRu3(CO)11]- as the major ruthenium species, in addition to a minor amount of Ru3(CO)12 [22]. On the other hand, in the catalytic formylation of aryl iodides with palladium complexes, acylpalladium complexes are assumed to be an intermediate that gives the corresponding aldehydes by hydrogenolysis with H2. Therefore, in the reaction catalyzed by the Pd-Ru bimetallic system, the ruthenium hydride [HRu3(CO)111- and an acylpalladium complex are supposed to coexist in 5 the reaction mixture under the catalytic reaction conditions. Yoshida et al. reported previously that the rate-determining step of the formylation of iodobenzene by PdC12 in pyridine is the hydrogenolysis of a benzoylpalladium complex [ 23 ] . Considering that the reaction of Pd(CO) (PPh3)3 and iodobenzene readily gives a benzoylpalladium complex PdI(COPh)(PPh3)2 at room temperature [24], it is reasonable to presume that the rate-determining step of the formylation of iodides by a Pd-phosphine catalyst is also the hydrogenolysis of intermediary acylpalladium complexes. On the basis of these considerations, we examined reactions of PdI(CO-p-Tol)(PPh3)2 with several anionic metal hydrides or H2 to clarify the role of ruthenium in the catalytic formylation. The results are summarized in Table 4. As expected, ruthenium hydrides, especially [HRu3(CO)11]-, were found to react smoothly with PdI(COpTol)(PPh3)2 to give tolualdehyde under mild conditions. It should be pointed out that the reactions in benzene even at 40 C are slow, owing to the low solubility of both PdI(CO p-Tol)(PPh3)2 and ruthenium hydrides, but the complexes dissolved gradually and the yield of the aldehyde increased up to 68% after ca. 1 h (Fig. 2). As the reaction proceeded, formation of a black precipitate was observed, which is assumed to be Pd metal. In contrast, PdI(CO-p-Tol)(PPh3)2 did not react with H2 at 40 C even under 40 atm, and no tolualdehyde was detected by GLC analysis. The results of these stoichiometric reactions strongly suggest that, in the catalytic formylation by the Pd-Ru catalyst, the hydrogenolysis of the acylpalladium intermediate PdI(COR)(PPh3)2 with a ruthenium hydride (probably [HRu3(CO)11]-) proceeds more rapidly than the hydrogenolysis with 112- Palladium(0) and ruthenium(0) species formed concurrently with an aldehyde are again transformed into PdI(COR)(PPh3)2 and [HRu3(CO)111 , respectively, under the catalytic reaction conditions, and this completes the bimetallic catalytic cycle (Scheme 1, the right-hand cycle). Since the ratedetermining step seems to be the hydrogenolysis of PdI(COR)(PPh3)2 (vO supra), the above mechanism probably accounts for the rate enhancement TABLE 4 Reactions between a palladium acyl complex and metal hydrides' Run no.

Proposed mechanism of formylation of aryl iodides by the Pd-Ru bimetallic catalyst. by the Pd-Ru bimetallic catalyst, although other possibilities such as participation of mixed-metal clusters cannot be completely excluded. Interestingly, PdI(CO p-Tol)(PPh3)2 also reacted with [NEt4 ][HCr2(CO)lol and [NEt4][HMo2(CO)to] to give p-tolualdehyde in good yields even at 0 C (Fig. 2), although neither [NEt4] [HCr2(CO)lo] nor chromium and molybdenum carbonyl exhibited any appreciable synergistic effects. This is probably explained by nonregeneration of the anionic carbonyl hydrides of chromium and molybdenum under the catalytic reaction conditions. In conclusion, the novel bimetallic catalytic system PdClz(PPh3)2Ru3(CO)12 is found to be effective for the formylation of aryl and alkenyl 7 iodides under mild conditions. This catalyst provides a rare example of dinuclear reductive elimination actually working in the catalytic cycle. Further study to develop novel multimetallic catalysts is now in progress. Experimental General procedure Triethylamine, iodobenzene and all the solvents were dried, distilled and stored under nitrogen. (Z)-3-Iodohex-3-ene was prepared according to the literature method [ 19 ]. Pentacarbonyliron was distilled and stored under CO. Other iodides and metal carbonyls were used as received. Complexes PdC12(PPh3)2 [25], PdI(CO-p-Tol)(PPh3)z [24], [Et4N][HRu3(CO)11] [22], [PPN][HRu(CO)4] [26], [Et4N][HCr2(CO),o] [27] and [Et4N][HMo2(CO)lol [ 27 ] were prepared by literature procedures. All the aldehydes produced by the catalytic formylation were fully identified by 400 MHz 'H NMR and IR after purification by silica-gel column chromatography and bulb-to-bulb distillation. Quantitative GLC analyses were carried out on a Shimadzu GC-14A instrument equipped with a flame ionization detector using 25 m x 0.25 mm fused silica capillary column CBP1 or CBP10. Catalytic formylation of iodides In a typical run, PdC12(PPh3)2 (0.10 mmol), Ru3(CO)1z (0.067 mmol), iodobenzene (2.04 g, 10 mmol), triethylamine (1.65 ml, 12 mmol) and benzene (10 ml) as solvent were charged in a 100 ml stainless-steel autoclave under nitrogen atmosphere. The autoclave was pressurized to 100 atm with CO-H2 (1:1) at room temperature, and heated to 70 C. The reaction was allowed to proceed at that temperature for 1.5 h with magnetic stirring. After the reaction, the autoclave was rapidly cooled to room temperature, and the pressure was slowly released. Naphthalene (ca. 1 g) was added to the reaction mixture as an internal standard, and the liquid phase was analyzed by GLC. The conversion of iodobenzene was 66%, and benzaldehyde was formed in 65% yield, based on the iodobenzene initially charged. Hydrogenolysis of PdI(CO-p-Tol)(PPhj)2 with metal hydrides In a typical run, PdI(CO p-Tol)(PPh3)2 (0.05 mmol), a ruthenium hydride (0.05 mmol) and naphthalene (5 mg) as an internal standard were warmed to 40 C in a Schlenk tube under CO atmosphere. Benzene (2 ml) and NEt3 (0.06 mmol) warmed to 40 C were then transferred to the Schlenk tube and the reaction mixture was stirred at that temperature. GLC analyses were performed about every 6 min until the yield of p-tolualdehyde stopped increasing. After 40 min, the yield of p-tolualdehyde reached 65%. Hydrogenolysis of Pdl(CO-p-TOL)(PPh3)2 with H2 PdI(CO p-Tol)(PPh3)2 (0.05 mmol), naphthalene (5 mg), triethylamine (0.06 mmol) and benzene (2 ml) were charged in a 50 ml stainless-steel 8 autoclave under CO atmosphere. The autoclave was warmed to 40 C, then pressurized to 40 atm with H2. After stirring for 2h, hydrogen was released, and the autoclave was opened under nitrogen atmosphere. GLC analysis of the reaction mixture revealed that no p-tolualdehyde had been formed. References 1 P. Braunstein and J. Rose, in I.

Homogeneous multimetallic catalysts Part 10. Formylation of aryl and alkenyl iodides by palladium—ruthenium bimetallic catalysts Yoshihiko Misumi Youichi Ishii Masanobu Hidai ∗∗ Department of Synthetic Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113 Japan ** Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. The PdCl2(PPh3)2—Ru3(CO)12 bimetallic system exhibited higher catalytic activity for the formylation of aryl and alkenyl iodides than PdCl2(PPh3)2 or Ru3(CO)12 alone. Thus, in the formylation of iodobenzene (at 70 °C for 1.5 h under 50:50 atm of CO:H2), the yield of benzaldehyde by PdCl2(PPh3)2—Ru3(CO)12 catalyst (Pd:Ru = 1:2) was about four times as high as that by PdCl2(PPh3)2 alone. Carbonyl complexes of other metals, such as Mn2(CO)10, Co2(CO)8, Cr(CO)6, Fe(CO)5, Mo(CO)6 and W(CO)6 were ineffective as the second component of the catalyst. To clarify the mechanism of the synergistic effects, the reaction of PdI(CO-p-Tol)(PPh3)2 with [HRu3(CO)11]− or [HRu(CO)4]−, ruthenium hydride species known to be generated under the catalytic formylation conditions, was performed. The reaction rapidly proceeded at 40 °C by dinuclear reductive elimination to form p-tolualdehyde, although the reaction with molecular hydrogen was very slow. These results strongly suggest that the improved catalytic activity of the Pd—Ru system is attributable to the high hydrogenolysis activity of in-situ-generated ruthenium hydride species.
