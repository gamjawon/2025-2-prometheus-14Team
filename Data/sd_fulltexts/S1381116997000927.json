It was found that dechlorination of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene to benzene effectively occurred in a 2-propmlol solution of a base compound such as NaOH or KOH in the presence of Rh/C or Pd/C at temperatures below 65. When deuti;rium-labeled 2-propanol, CD3CD(OD)CD3, was used as a solvent, 1,2,4-trichloro- benzene was dechlorinated to give ben,~ene containing D atoms with high yield, indicating that the hydrodechlorination reaction includes hydrogen-transfer from 2-propanol to chlorobenzenes. Iodo-, bromo- and fluoro-benzenes were also readily dehalogenated in the catalytic system. ~ 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction The development of effective procedures for dehalogenation of organic halides is a current issue in protecting ourselves from pollution by industrial halogen-containing organic wastes. There has been reported a number of catalytic dehalogenation methods for organic halides. In conventional procedures, molecular hydrogen has been widely employed for the catalytic hy- drodehalogenation of organic ~alides [1], in which high hydrogen pressure (about 50 atm) is * Corresponding author.

In recent years, facile methods have been developed including transfer hydrogenation by using hydrogen donors such as metal hydrides [4,5], formic acid and its salts [6-9] and alcohols [10-13]. The hydrogen- transfer usually proceeds under relatively mild conditions in the presence of noble metal or transition metal catalysts. We have found that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) can be completely dechlofinated to biphenyl and phenylcyclohexane using a 2-pro- panol solution of sodium hydroxide in the pres- ence of carbon-supported noble metal catalysts at temperatures below 82 [14]. The following reaction scheme has been postulated including hydrogen-transfer from 2-propanol to organic chlorides, where aryl chloride (At-C1) is era- 1381-1169/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this study, we wish to demonstrate that 2-propanol functions as a hydrogen-donor in the present system with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as a substrate, and discuss the hydrogen-transfer scheme. Systematic experiments were done to examine the advantages of the proposed system by using four carbon-supported noble metal cat- alysts (Rh/C, Pd/C, Ru/C and Pt/C), five base compounds (NaOH, KOH, Ca(OH)z, NazCO3 and (CzHs)3N) and four solvents (2- propanol, 1-propanol, ethanol and 2-butanol). Finally, the present system was applied to de- halogenation of iodobenzene, bromobenzene and fluorobenzene as well as chlorobenzene. (1) (2) (3) 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials CD3CD(OD)CD3 (99 atom % D) and CH3CH(OD)CH3 (98 atom % D) were obtained from Aldrich. Other chemicals employed here were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals. 2.2. General procedure In a typical example, a solution of 1,2,4-tri- chlorobenzene and NaOH in alcohol (60 ml) was added to a 200 ml three-necked flask joined to a thermometer, a condenser and a nitrogen cylinder. After the air in the flask was com- pletely replaced by nitrogen, a catalytic amount of carbon-supported noble catalyst was added. The reaction mixture was stirred vigorously with a magnetic stirrer and was kept at a desired temperature (40-82) using a thermostated water bath. During the reaction, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was taken and diluted by a suitable solvent for analysis. The dechlorination reaction using deuterium-labeled 2-propanol was carried out with 5 ml of solution in a test tube. 2.3. Analysis The concentration of aromatic halides, ben- zene and acetone was determined using capil- lary GC (HP 6890) equipped with an FID and a column of HP-5 (25 m 0.32 mm, 0.52 /.tm film thickness) or DB-Wax (30 m 0.32 mm, 0.5 /zm film thickness), n-dodecane was used as the internal standard. The products in the reaction with deuterium-labeled 2-propanol were analyzed by GC/MS (GC: HP 5890, MS: HP 5971A) with a column of HP-5MS (30 m 0.25 mm, 0.25 /.tin film thickness). Four carbon-supported noble metal catalysts (Pd/C, Rh/C, Ru/C and Pt/C) used in this study were purchased from N.E. Chemcat (powder; mean particle size, ca. 30 /xm). The concentration of noble metal was 5 wt% in all catalysts. The catalysts were pre-dried in a vac- uum for 30 min at 200 and kept in a desicca- tor. Deuterium-labeled 2-propanol, 3. Results 3.1.

The re- action was carried out using 2;-propanol as a solvent and NaOH as a base compound in the presence of Pd/C at 64. The initial concen- tration of the substrate was 20 mM and that of NaOH was 90 mM, i.e., the 1.5 molar equiva- lent to the C1 atoms contained in the initial amount of trichlorobenzene. As the concentra- tion of trichlorobenzene decreased, the concen- tration of di- and mono-chlorobenzene gradually increased to the maximum value, followed by a decrease in the concentration down to disap- pearance. The concentration o[ benzene in- creased without loss of material balance. These results indicate that trichlorobenzene was dechlorinated stepwise to yield tLe chlorine-free product. The catalytic activities of foar carbon-sup- ported noble metal catalysts (Rh/C, Pd/C, Pt/C and Ru/C) were examined in the hydro- dechlorination reaction of 1,2,4-trichlorobe- nzene at 42.

The reaction time could be readily reduced by increasing the amount of catalyst and elevating the reaction temperature to 82 (boiling and reflux condition). Indeed, the hy- drodechlorination reaction was completed within 0.5 h using Rh/C (300 mg) at 82. Of the two active catalysts (Pd/C and Rh/C), Pd/C was adopted for the following experi- ments, since it is moderately active to follow the reaction process and is more economical for practical use than Rh catalysts. 3.2. Dependence of the initial concentration of base compound on the dechlorination level of 1, 2, 4-trichlorobenzene In order to elucidate the influence of base compound on the hydrodechlorination reaction, the reaction was performed at different initial amounts of sodium hydroxide.

In compar- ison, Na2CO3, Ca(OH)2 and (CzHs)3N were less active for the reaction, where NazCO3 and Ca(OH)2 are insoluble to 2-propanol. When primary alcohols such as 1-propanol and ethanol were used as a solvent, the conver- sion of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene and the yield of benzene were very low. On the other hand, secondary alcohols such as 2-butanol and 2-pro- panol led to a high yield of benzene, although the yield with 2-propanol was incomparably high. This indicates that the secondary alcohol, 2-propanol, is undoubtedly a suitable solvent for the hydrodechlorination reaction. the concentration of chlorobenzenes, and total C1 atoms initially contained in 1,2,4-trichlorobe- nzene. In the absence of sodium hydroxide, the hydrodechlorination reaction of 1,2,4-trichloro- benzene hardly occurred (curve a). When an excess molar amount of sodium hydroxide to C1 atoms contained in the initial amount of sub- strate was added, dechlorination was completed within 3 h (curve b). The addition of a smaller amount of sodium hydroxide led to incomplete dechlorination (curve c), in which the level of dechlorination (0.75) was in good agreement with molar ratio of NaOH to C1 atoms contained in the initial amount of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (0.69). This is because sodium hydroxide was consumed to neutralize HC1 formed during the reaction (Eq. (3)). Thus, an excess molar amount of base compound (base/C1 > 1) is required to achieve complete hydrodechlorination. 3.3.

Experimental evidence of hydrogen-transfer during hydrodechlorination reaction of 1,2,4- trichlorobenzene The hydrodechlorination reaction of 1,2,4-tri- chlorobenzene was carried out using deuterium-labeled 2-propanol as a solvent, which could be distinguished from other sources of hydrogen such as trace amounts of water contained in the solvent and OH- from sodium hydroxide. It was expected that benzene con- taining D atoms would be produced, if hydro- gen-transfer from 2-propanol to chlorobenzenes took place in the reaction.

The peaks with mass numbers (m/z) of 81, 80, 79, 78 correspond to the parent peaks of C6H3D3, C6H4D2, C6HsD and C6H6, re- spectively. As seen in Fig. 4A, an intense parent peak of C6H3D3 (m/z= 81) was observed, indicating that D-containing benzene was pref- erentially produced with high yield. Taking ac- count of mass fragmentation, the actual content of D atoms in benzene could be roughly esti- mated to be > 90% of the theoretical content. In contrast, almost no D-containing products were observed in the reaction with CH3CH(OD)CH3 just like the non-labeled ex- periment (see Fig. 4B and C). Therefore, it was concluded that 2-propanol functions as a hydro- gen-donor and c~-hydrogen of 2-propanol is likely to be transferred to the substrate in the hydrodechlorination reaction. 3.5. Efficiency of hydrogen-transfer during hy- drodechIorination reaction of 1,2, 4-trichlorobe- nzene During the hydrodechlorination of 1,2,4-tri- chlorobenzene, the amount of acetone increases as a result of hydrogen transfer (see Eq. (4)) and the concurrent dehydrogenation of 2-propanol with formation of H2. Since the dechlorination of one C1 atom leads to the formation of one acetone molecule, the efficiency of hydrogen- transfer can be estimated from the following equation: (molar amount of released chlorine)/(molar amount of produced acetone). Table 2 indicates the amount of released chlorine estimated from change in concentration Table 2 Efficiency of hydrogen-transfer during catalyti[: dechlorination of 1,2,4-trchlorobenzene in 2-propanol solution a Catalyst Reaction time (h) Released C1 (mmol) Produced acetone (rnmol) H-transfer b (%) 5% Rh/C 0.2 3.5 5.6 63 5% Pd/C 3.0 2.8 9.5 29 5% Pt/C 3.0 1.8 9.7 19 5% Ru/C 3.0 0 2.7 0 a Reaction conditions: 2-propanol, 60 ml; 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, 1.2 mmol; NaOH, 5.4 mmol; Temperature, 55; catalyst, 150 mg. b 100 (released Cl)/(produced acetone). 140 Y.

The difficulty of reductive dehalogenation may arise from its large bond dissociation energy [1]: C-F (453.6 kJ/mol), C-C1 (340.2 kJ/mol), C-Br (281.4 kJ/mol) and C-I (222.6 kJ/mol). It can be seen that the dehalogenation rate of C6HsF accelerated after other aryl halides were dehalogenated (t = 120 in Fig. 5). This implies that the adsorption of aryl halides is rather selective and the adsorbed molecule is activated on the catalyst surface. In fact, the affinity of aryl halides to the catalyst (Pd/C) has been determined to be in the decreasing order: C6HsI > C6HsBr > C6H5C1 > C6HsF [7]. of chlorobenzenes, the amount of produced ace- tone and the efficiency of hydrogen-transfer with four noble metal catalysts. A large amount of acetone was produced in all catalytic sys- tems, exceeding the amount of released chlo- rine. From the estimated efficiency of hydro- gen-transfer, it was found that Rh/C was the most efficient for hydrogen-transfer reaction, followed by Pd/C, Pt/C and Ru/C. This order is in agreement with that of the catalytic activity of dechlorination (see Fig. 2). Therefore, it can be concluded that the higher dechlorination ac- tivities of Rh/C and Pd/C arise from their high efficiency of hydrogen-transfer. 3.6. Application to dehalogenation of various aromatic halides Fig. 5 shows the time course of a catalytic dehalogenation reaction of a mixture containing equivalent molar amounts of C6HsF, C6H5C1, C6HsBr and C6HsI. It can be seen that C6HsI was preferentially dehalogenated within 5 min, and then dehalogenation of C6HsBr and C6H5C1 was completed, followed by dehalo- genation of C6H5F after prolonged reaction (5 h). In previous papers, it has been reported that the dehalogenation rate of aryl halides follows 4. Discussion On the basis of the above experimental re- suits, it was concluded that 2-propanol functions as a hydrogen-donor as well as a solvent in the catalytic hydrodehalogenation of aromatic halides. It has been reported that 2-propanol is widely used as hydrogen donors in homoge- neous and heterogeneous catalytic transfer hy- drogenation of organic compounds such as alkenes, ketones and aldehydes [17]. A reaction mechanism including hydride species as hydro- gen transfer species has been proposed in the homogeneous system catalyzed by metal com- plexes [17]. The presence of hydride species has also been suggested in the dehydrogenation of 2-propanol with rhodium chloride, in which molecular hydrogen is formed by the reaction of a rhodium hydride intermediate with protons from the solvent [20]. Assuming that hydrogen of alcohols is likely to be transferred as a hydride species, it is reasonable to conclude that secondary alcohols are the best hydrogen donors among alcohols; an a-hydrogen of a primary alcohol is less likely to react as a hydride species because of the smaller electron-releasing inductive effect of the alkyl group and tertiary E Ukisu, T. Miyadera/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 125 (1997) 135-142 141 alcohols have no a-hydrogen, indeed, the D- labeled experiment in the present study has revealed that o~-hydrogen of 2-propanol is ex- clusively transferred to the substrate. Further- more, the presence of hydride ~pecies on the solid catalysts was assumed in the gas-phase hydrodechlorination of chlorobenzene with H2 [18,19]. On the basis of these results, it is probable that the hydrogen-tran~ffer species in our system consisting of 2-propanol, base com- pound and noble metal catalyst was a hydride species, although there is less information on the heterogeneous catalytic transfer hydrogena- tion than on the homogeneous system. The key step in the overall reaction should be the hydrogen-transfer process cn the catalyst surface, since high efficiency of lc:ydrogen trans- fer leads to high dechlorination activity. In het- erogeneous transfer hydrogenation with solid catalysts, the hydrogen donors can often be decomposed to evolve molecular hydrogen even in the absence of hydrogen acceptors. There- fore, it is likely that the acceptor adsorbs on the contiguous site of the donor to Iransfer hydro- gen. In the homogeneous transter hydrogena- tion, on the other hand, a single site mechanism including simultaneous coordiration of the donor and the acceptor on the central metal of the catalyst has been often propo!;ed [17]. It is interesting to note that selected base compounds such as NaOH and KOH are effec- tive for the hydrodechlorination reaction. This implies that the role of base compounds is not limited to neutralization of HC1 (Eq. (3)). It has been suggested that base compounds facilitate the catalytic dehalogenation of organic halides in some way [21,22]. Indeed, we found that NaOH promotes dehydrogenation of 2-propanol (Eq. (1)) with noble metal catalysts [23]. Finally, it should be noted that fluoroben- zene, which is too stable to decompose in most catalytic systems with a hydrogen,-donor, can be readily dehalogenated in our system. In a previ- ous paper [14], we reported that our system is effective for dechlorination of p?lychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Thus, the present system is so powerful that it can be expected to decom- pose other toxic organic halides under mild conditions. 5. Conclusions In the catalytic hydrodehalogenation system for aromatic halides consisting of a noble metal catalyst (Pd/C or Rh/C), a base compound (NaOH or KOH) and 2-propanol, the catalyst catalyzes dehydrogenation of 2-propanol and consecutive hydrogen-transfer to aromatic halides. High efficiency of hydrogen-transfer catalyzed by Rh/C and Pd/C leads to rapid hydrodehalogenation of aromatic halides. The addition of base compound is indispensable to remove the released halogen as its salt and is likely to promote dehydrogenation of 2-pro- panol. Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to Dr. S.

Tel.: +81-298-588219; fax: +81-298588208 Catalytic hydrodehalogenation of aromatic halides was carried out in an alcohol solution containing base compounds in the presence of carbon-supported noble metal catalysts. It was found that dechlorination of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene to benzene effectively occurred in a 2-propanol solution of a base compound such as NaOH or KOH in the presence of Rh/C or Pd/C at temperatures below 65°C. When deuorium-labeled 2-propanol, CD3CD(OD)CD3, was used as a solvent, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene was dechlorinated to give benzene containing D atoms with high yield, indicating that the hydrodechlorination reaction includes hydrogen-transfer from 2-propanol to chlorobenzenes. Iodo-, bromo- and fluoro-benzenes were also readily dehalogenated in the catalytic system.
