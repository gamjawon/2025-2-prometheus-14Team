Relative initial reaction rates for both double bond isomerization and direct esterification with heptanoic acid were determined for the series of linear 1-alkenes from 1-octene to 1-octadecene. In competitive reactions between two 1-alkenes on Amberlyst®15 catalyst at 90 °C, rates for both double bond isomerization and esterification decreased with increasing carbon chain length. Data suggested each 1-alkene had two different adsorption coefficients on the catalyst, one for an isomerization site and one for a site for the addition reaction. Results were consistent with previous data suggesting that Amberlyst®15 catalyst has two different types of active sites.

Amberlyst®15 catalyst is a sulfonated copolymer of styrene and divinyl benzene [12,13]. Its active sites are sulfonic acid groups attached to aromatic rings, and its structure and properties have been studied extensively [13–19]. Much experimental data indicate that its surface sites are all equally acidic and strongly suggest site homogeneity. Recent kinetic data, however, have provided substantial evidence that Amberlyst®15 catalyst must have two different types of active sites. The two sites have become apparent, only when two different reactions were studied at the same time. To our knowledge, the first hint that Amberlyst®15 catalyst might have two different types of active sites came during a study of concurrent reactions of 2-octanol [20]. During the esterification reaction between 2-octanol and heptanoic acid to make 2-octyl heptanoate, dehydration of 2-octanol to 2-octenes was also observed. Dehydration occurred via a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, while esterification occurred via an Eley-Rideal mechanism. Kinetic data for these two concurrent reactions could not be reconciled using models that assumed both reactions occurred on the same site. A subsequent study of the alkylation of p-xylene by 1-dodecene again suggested that Amberlyst®15 catalyst must have two different types of sites [1]. Double bond isomerization of 1-dodecene occurred alongside its addition reaction with p-xylene. Kinetic data suggested weak adsorption by 1-dodecene for the isomerization reaction but strong adsorption by 1-dodecene for the alkylation reaction. The linear 1-alkene appeared to adsorb onto two different types of sites. An investigation of the direct esterification of 1-tetradecene by heptanoic acid on Amberlyst®15 catalyst provided additional evidence for two distinct types of acid sites [2]. Kinetic data for concurrent double bond isomerization of tetradecene and direct esterification could be reconciled only if the two reactions were occurring on separate sites. Most recently, the double bond isomerization of a number of linear 1-alkenes was investigated alongside their concurrent dimerization reactions on Amberlyst®15 catalyst [3]. Kinetic data showed conclusively that double bond isomerization occurred on a site where alkene adsorption coefficients were small (i.e., < 0.01), while dimerization occurred on a site where alkene adsorption coefficients were large (i.e., > ∼10). For alkenes, there appeared to be two distinct types of adsorption sites on Amberlyst®15 catalyst. Based on a wealth of longstanding data [13–19], the sites must all be equally acidic, but there must be two different steric environments for the sites, one that is more easily accessed by alkenes than the other. Adsorption strongly affects rates of alkene reactions on Amberlyst®15 catalyst. Rates of alkene dimerization make this point clear. In side-by-side reactions, all the linear 1-alkenes in the series 1-decene to 1-octadecene dimerize with themselves at the same rate. However, in competitive reactions between two different linear 1-alkenes of equal concentration, the short alkene reacts faster than the long one in this homologous series. A kinetic model attributing all the rate differences solely to differences in adsorption coefficients fit all available data [6]. We expect that relative isomerization rates of competing alkenes depend upon relative adsorption coefficients, too, but we are unaware of published reports of relative isomerization rates across a homologous series of alkene chain lengths. In this current study, we aimed to acquire new data to either support or challenge the hypothesis that Amberlyst®15 catalyst has two distinct types of acid sites. To that end, we have investigated the relative rates of double bond isomerization and relative rates of addition (esterification) for the series of linear 1-alkenes from C8 to C18 on dry Amberlyst®15 catalyst at 90 °C. The addition reaction that occurred alongside double bond isomerization was the direct esterification reaction with heptanoic acid to make secondary alkyl heptanoates. Our goal was to determine how chain length affected reaction rates and adsorption coefficients for linear 1-alkenes and to determine how observed trends for double bond isomerization compared with analogous trends for direct esterification. We reasoned that rates of isomerization and esterification would respond identically to changes in alkene chain length, if both reactions occurred on the same active sites, but that rates of isomerization and esterification could respond differently to changes in alkene chain length, if the two reactions occurred on separate sites. 2 Experimental 2.1 Initial rate experiments All linear 1-alkenes and a mixture of linear internal hexadecene isomers were products of Chevron Phillips Chemical (The Woodlands, TX). Heptanoic acid (>99 %) and n-tridecane (>99 %) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Amberlyst®15 catalyst (Dupont) was dried to constant mass in a vacuum oven at 80–90 °C for at least 24 h before use. All catalyst spheres were 0.4–0.8 mm in diameter, and grinding them to smaller particles had no effect on observed rates in this study. A typical experiment utilized five different reaction mixtures that each contained two different linear 1-alkenes and a fixed concentration of heptanoic acid. The initial total alkene concentration was the same in all five mixtures, but the relative concentrations of the two alkenes were different in each mixture. Molar concentration ratios of alkene 1 to alkene 2 were 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0. The total alkene concentration was 1.4 M in each solution, and the concentration of heptanoic acid was 1.4 M in each solution. These concentrations gave reasonable reaction rates and product yields that were compatible with our analytical technique. The solvent was n-tridecane. Table 1 shows the initial compositions of five example solutions for an experiment comparing 1-dodecene and 1-hexadecene. Each solution was placed in a separate glass vial with a stir bar, and each solution heated (90 °C) and stirred (300 rpm) for 30 min in a Chemglass Aluminum Reaction Block Model 1991–03 heater/stirrer. The stirring rate was at least twice the minimum rate previously determined to overcome mass transport effects for both esterification and isomerization on this catalyst in our equipment at 90 °C [2]. Five other vials each contained 2.0 g dry Amberlyst®15 catalyst and were also heated for 30 min in the same heating block. At two-minute intervals, each solution was added to a sample of catalyst and set back in the heating block to stir. Solutions were sampled at reaction times of 10 min or 20 min and analyzed by gas chromatography. Average relative initial reaction rates were calculated for both double bond isomerization (1-alkene to 2-alkenes) and direct esterification. Alkene conversion was tailored by using sometimes 1.0 g, sometimes 2.0 g of catalyst and either 10 or 20 min of reaction. Because rates of isomerization were much faster than esterification, we sometimes used multiple experiments for the same pair of alkenes to get reliable data for initial relative rates of both isomerization and esterification. Target alkene conversions were about 1–5 % to obtain data reliable for calculating initial rates. Rates were calculated as mmol/(ml min) and were reproducible to within ± 4 %. No observable isomerization or esterification occurred in the absence of catalyst. 2.2 Gas chromatographic method Analyses were performed using an Agilent 8890 gas chromatograph using a split injector (50:1 split ratio) and a flame ionization detector (FID). The column was an HP-5 capillary column, 50 m x 0.2 mm × 0.5 µm. Injector temperature was 275 °C; initial oven temperature was 80 °C; temperature increased 10 °C/minute to 300 °C and remained there for 20 min. An example chromatogram is shown in Fig. 1. Small, unlabeled peaks are for traces of other alkenes present with the main alkenes. Peak areas are proportional to the mass detected of the eluting compounds. Peaks for esters and alkenes were integrated to calculate the fraction of alkenes converted to ester in each sample. Similarly, peaks for cis and trans-2-alkenes were resolved and were used to calculate the fraction of 1-alkene that isomerized to 2-alkene. For each alkene, the peak for cis-2-alkene was completely resolved from all other peaks, while the trans-2-alkene typically coeluted with a small amount of trace branched isomers. At low conversions, the cis-2-alkene was used alone to determine relative rates of isomerization for two competing linear 1-alkenes. 3 Results and discussion Direct esterification of linear 1-alkenes on solid protic acids follows the general route shown in Scheme 1. Protonation of the alkene gives a secondary carbenium ion intermediate that reacts with carboxylic acid to form secondary esters. The reaction on dry Amberlyst®15 catalyst has been studied in detail [2,7,21]. It occurs by an Eley-Rideal mechanism in which adsorbed alkene reacts with carboxylic acid that is in the bulk phase. Adsorption and desorption are rapid; all reactants and products compete for active sites; and the surface reaction is the rate-limiting step. The hydrophobic reaction medium does not swell the resin, and all reactions occur on accessible sites on the exterior of the catalyst particles. The rate of the esterification reaction at a specific point in time therefore follows: (1) esterification rate = kest[adsorbed alkene][carboxylic acid in bulk phase] Similarly, isomerization rates of 1-alkene to 2-alkenes depend upon the concentration of alkene adsorbed on the isomerization site and follow: (2) isomerization rate = kisom[adsorbed alkene] On Amberlyst®15 catalyst, double bond isomerization likely does not involve an intermediate carbenium ion [2]. . Adsorption of alkene A onto an active site is described by the simple equilibrium shown below: A + cat ⟶ ⟵ k 2 k 1 A ads The adsorption coefficient K = k1/k2 and is given by: (3) K = [ A ads ] A [ cat ] Rearranging, (4) [Aads] = K[A][cat] For two alkenes A1 and A2 competing for adsorption sites in the same mixture, we can write: (5) [ A 1 , ads ] [ A 2 , ads ] = K 1 A 1 [ cat ] K 2 A 2 [ cat ] For rapid adsorption and desorption, when reaction rate of A is directly proportional to [Aads] (i.e., rate = kobs[Aads]), we have: (6) Rate 1 Rate 2 = K 1 A 1 K 2 A 2 A plot of y = Rate 1 Rate 2 versus x = [ A ] 1 [ A ] 2 has slope = K 1 K 2 . For two competing alkenes A1 and A2, we can therefore determine their relative adsorption coefficients by comparing their initial reaction rates for a number of different relative starting concentrations. We assume here that A1,ads and A2,ads have equal reactivities with heptanoic acid. This assumption is reasonable, if A1,ads and A2,ads are both intermediates formed from linear 1-alkenes. (For alkene dimerization on Amberlyst®15 catalyst, all adsorbed linear alkenes showed equal reactivities with alkenes in the bulk phase [6]) For isomerization, we also assume that isomerization rates of adsorbed 1-alkenes are independent of alkene chain length. We determined relative initial rates of isomerization and relative initial rates of esterification for a number of pairs of linear 1-alkenes. Rates of isomerization of 1-alkene to 2-alkenes were typically 3–5 times faster than the corresponding rates of alkene conversion to esters in the same solutions. Figs. 2 and 3 show example data for competing reactions involving 1-dodecene and 1-hexadecene. The slope of the Fig. 2 plot gives the ratio of the adsorption coefficients for 1-dodecene and 1-hexadecene for double bond isomerization. The slope of the Fig. 3 plot gives the ratio of the adsorption coefficients for 1-dodecene and 1-hexadecene for direct esterification. Typical R2 values for all such plots from our work were > 0.99. Consider that the adsorption coefficient for a linear 1-alkene on the isomerization site may be different than its adsorption coefficient on the esterification site. Table 2 summarizes relative adsorption coefficients determined in this manner for eight pairs of linear 1-alkenes for both double bond isomerization and for direct esterification. We used these pairs of relative adsorption coefficients to calculate relative adsorption coefficients for all the linear 1-alkenes from C8 to C18, using the C18 value as the reference for each reaction (relative KC18 = 1). We make no assumptions about the actual adsorption coefficients and are determining only relative adsorption coefficients. For purposes of the investigation here, the adsorption coefficient for 1-octadecene is unknown and may be large or small on either active site. Best fit values for the relative adsorption coefficients in the alkene series are shown in Fig. 4, when the relative adsorption coefficient for 1-octadecene is assigned a value of 1 for each reaction site. The Y-values in Fig. 4 are the optimum values for minimizing errors calculated using the Fig. 4 Y-values and the experimentally determined values listed in Table 2. This error across the j (i.e., 8) pairs of linear 1-alkenes in Table 2 was calculated by: Error = ∑ n = 1 j K a K b − observed K a K b 2 where observed K a K b is the experimentally determined ratio of adsorption coefficients for 1-alkenes a and b listed in Table 2, and Ka and Kb are the relative adsorption coefficients for 1-alkenes a and b, when KC18 = 1 for reference. Ka and Kb are adjusted to minimize the error for relative adsorption coefficients observed for the 1-alkenes in each reaction (isomerization and esterification). Fig. 4 shows that adsorption coefficients decrease markedly, as 1-alkene chain length increases from 8 carbons to 18 carbons. The uncertainty for the C8 relative value is ± 0.13; for the other 1-alkenes, the uncertainty is within ± 0.08. This trend of decreasing 1-alkene adsorption coefficients as chain length increases is consistent with previous reports [6,22–26]. The curves are similar but not identical for isomerization and esterification. The existence of two different trends for double bond isomerization versus direct esterification suggests that these two reactions are occurring on separate sites: Each alkene appears to have an adsorption coefficient for an isomerization site and a separate adsorption coefficient for a site that catalyzes direct esterification. Fig. 4 also provides clues to the actual adsorption coefficients for the linear 1-alkenes on the esterification sites. Reference [21] reports that the adsorption coefficient of 1-tetradecene on the esterification sites of Amberlyst®15 catalyst at 90 °C is 8 ± 0.8. Using this value as a reference, we can estimate Kads ∼ 25 for 1-octene and Kads ∼ 4 for 1-octadecene on the esterification sites, providing a range for the adsorption coefficients for the 1-alkenes between 1-octene and 1-octadecene. The relative adsorption coefficients we calculated for 1-alkenes on the esterification sites are slightly different than relative adsorption coefficients previously reported [6] for linear alkenes on Amberlyst®15 dimerization sites. The reason for the differences likely stems from the methods used to calculate the relative adsorption coefficients. The relative adsorption coefficients reported for alkenes on the dimerization sites were calculated by fitting data across several hours of reaction, during which the 1-alkenes were rapidly isomerizing to internal alkenes. Those adsorption coefficients likely represent average values for several alkenes that have the same number of carbons but different double bond positions. By contrast, the relative adsorption coefficients reported here for alkenes on the esterification sites were calculated using initial rates for 1-alkenes only and are not affected by concurrent double bond isomerization. (For alkenes, direct esterification and dimerization are both addition reactions that proceed through carbenium ion intermediates, and both reactions are expected to occur on the same sites on Amberlyst®15 catalyst.). Fig. 5 illustrates a previously proposed explanation for the existence of two different types of acidic sites on the surface of dry Amberlyst®15 catalyst [3,20]. The catalyst is a cross-linked copolymer of styrene and divinyl benzene that is sulfonated to yield sulfonic acid units on the aromatic rings. The stereochemistry of asymmetric carbons along the polymer chain is randomly R or S. Sites with at least one closest neighboring aromatic ring on the same side of the polymer backbone are more sterically hindered than those with no neighboring rings on the same side of the polymer backbone. The crowded sites are presumably the isomerization sites, and alkenes have much smaller adsorption coefficients on these sites than they do on the less crowded sites where addition reactions occur. For random stereochemistry of the asymmetric carbons, 75 % of the sites would have at least one neighboring site on the same side of the polymer backbone, while 25 % would not. All the sulfonic acid groups in Fig. 5 could be equally acidic and equally accessible to small molecules like NH3 that are used for adsorption studies of catalysts, but some may be more sterically hindered than others for approach by molecules as large as 1-octene or 1-octadecene. 3.1 Effect of double bond position on esterification rates Reference [2] reports that 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7-tetradecenes react with heptanoic acid on Amberlyst®15 catalyst at about half the rate of 1 or 2-tetradecene. The adsorption coefficients for 1&2-tetradecenes appeared to be about twice those of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7-tetradecenes. One might also postulate that all linear tetradecenes have the same adsorption coefficient but that carbenium ions derived from 1&2-tetradecenes are more reactive with heptanoic acid than are carbenium ions derived from 3 + -tetradecenes. A set of competitive reactions was therefore used to clarify whether differences in adsorption coefficients for different alkene isomers (i.e., different double bond positions for linear alkenes of the same carbon chain length) completely explained differences in alkene reaction rates with heptanoic acid. Consider the equimolar mixture of 1-hexadecene and 1-octadecene. In a competitive reaction with heptanoic acid on dry Amberlyst®15 catalyst, the relative rates of reaction for the two 1-alkenes depend upon their relative adsorption coefficients. If we replace the 1-hexadecene with equal moles of a mixture of internal hexadecenes, based on reference [2], we would expect the initial rate of esterification for hexadecene to decrease. If that drop in rate stems only from a drop in adsorption coefficient for internal hexadecences versus 1-hexadecene, we would expect that the rate of 1-octadecene reaction with heptanoic acid would increase in the same mixture, because 1-octadecene would be more competitive for adsorption sites versus internal hexadecenes than versus 1-hexadecene. However, the rate of 1-octadecene reaction with heptanoic acid would be unchanged, if adsorption coefficients for the internal hexadecenes are the same as the adsorption coefficient for 1-hexadecene. No change in the 1-octadecene rate when the hexadecene rate were decreasing would suggest that carbenium ions derived from highly internal alkenes are inherently less reactive toward bulk phase carboxylic acid than are carbenium ions at C2 or C3. Our experiment compared initial rates of esterification for five different equimolar mixtures of hexadecene and 1-octadecene. The hexadecene fraction in the mixtures consisted of mixtures of 1-hexadecene and internal hexadecenes. Hexadecene fractions in the solutions included mixtures that were 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 % 1-hexadecene, with the balance of the hexadecene fraction consisting of a mixture of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8-hexadecenes. Fig. 6 shows how initial C16 and C18 esterification rates changed in the equimolar mixtures of hexadecenes and octadecenes, as 1-hexadecene was gradually replaced with internal hexadecenes. The hexadecene reaction rate decreased linearly with increasing internal hexadecene content and showed that the rate for internal hexadecenes was less than half the rate of 1-hexadecene. In the same mixtures, the octadecene rate trended upwards. These observations support the proposal that adsorption is the main property affecting relative esterification rates between two different alkenes and that highly internal alkenes have smaller adsorption coefficients than 1-alkenes of the same carbon chain length. All secondary carbenium ions likely react with heptanoic acid at nearly the same rates. The double bond isomerization rates of 1-octadecene were also instructive. The isomerization rate of 1-octadecene to 2-octadecenes was the same in all five mixtures used for Fig. 6. Replacing 1-hexadecene with internal hexadecenes led to a ∼20 % increase in the C18 esterification rate but had no effect on the C18 isomerization rate. That observation again suggests that C18 isomerization occurs on a different site than C18 esterification. 4 Conclusions Short linear 1-alkenes adsorb more strongly to Amberlyst®15 catalyst than do long ones in the series from 1-octene to 1-octadecene. The downward trends in adsorption coefficients from 1-octene to 1-octadecene are slightly different for the two concurrent reactions double bond isomerization and direct esterification. This observation is consistent with the existence of two different types of acidic sites on the surface of Amberlyst®15 catalyst. One site appears to catalyze double bond isomerization, while a different site appears to catalyze the direct addition of heptanoic acid to make secondary esters. For two linear alkenes of the same carbon chain length, 1-alkenes adsorb about twice as strongly to the addition sites and react with heptanoic acid about twice as fast as highly internal alkenes.
