When adding Group V metals to Group I/Group III binary catalysts, a noticeable increase in the conversions of methane and oxygen was observed without any change in C2+ selectivity. Of the ternary metal oxide catalysts, a Na/La/ 0.3Nb metal oxide showed the highest performance, viz. a methane conversion of 16.0% and a C2+ selectivity of 74.1% at 1023 K under atmospheric pressure with a total gas flow-rate of 100 ml NTP/ rain ( CH4/O2 molar ratio = 9). The stability test using a Na/La/0.2Nb catalyst, which was performed under the same conditions as above, showed that the catalyst was very stable with no decrease in methane conversion and C2 ~ selectivity for more than 100 h. The crystalline structure, the surface composition and properties of base sites of Na/La/Nb oxide catalysts were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of carbon dioxide. The catalytic performance of the Na/La/Nb mixed oxides depended on the ratio of the two crystalline phases of La203 and La3NbO7. When sodium was added to La:O3 with a La/Na ratio of 1, new base sites were produced, resulting in an increase in the C2 + selectivity with a significant decrease in methane conversion. The methane conversion was increased by adding a small amount of niobium to the Na/La catalyst, resulting in a change of part of the La203 to La3NbO7. However, when all of the La203 was changed to La3NbO7, the C2+ selectivity decreased due to the lack of new base sites. A good balance of both crystals (La203 and La3NbOv) may be obtained at a Nb/Na atomic ratio of 0.15-0.3, which optimizes the catalytic performance of the mixed oxides. * Corresponding author. Tel.

Introduction Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is one of the promising reactions for conversion of natural gas to liquid fuels. The reaction can be carried out either by using redox type metal oxides with a feed of methane only, where lattice oxygen is used as an oxidant [ 1 ], or by using nonreducible metal oxides with a co-feed of methane and oxygen. Both methods have been investigated from the standpoint of process engineering for commercialization of the process [2-4]. A large number of catalysts have been reported for the co-feed reaction system, compared with the redox type catalysts. Almost all the metals listed in the Periodic Table have been tested as catalysts for the OCM reaction, among which alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, transition metals and lanthanide metals have been found to be effective catalysts [5-7]. These are used as a single oxide or a mixture in combination of two, three or more metal oxides. Of these metals, Group III metals, including lanthanide metals, show relatively good catalytic performance for the OCM reaction. For example, it has been reported that yttrium [8], lanthanum [9-11 ], and samarium [8] have high catalytic activity when used as a single oxide. There are also many papers dealing with catalytic systems in which alkali or alkaline earth metals are added to Group III metal oxides to improve the catalytic performance for the OCM reaction. For instance, selectivity to ethane and ethylene was increased by adding sodium [12] or barium [13] to cerium oxide, or strontium to lanthanum oxide [14]. However, the addition of alkali or alkaline earth metals may sometimes result in a decrease in activity for the OCM reaction. In the case of the Sr/La catalyst, it appears that the addition of strontium decreases the concentration of active lanthanum compounds on the sur- face [ 14]. Therefore, the addition of metals that are effective to enhance the activity is desirable in order to prevent the decrease in the activity of catalysts including alkali or alkaline earth metals. On the other hand, Amenomiya et al. [5] described in their review that Group V metals of the Periodic Table, viz. vanadium, niobium and tantalum, were used less as catalysts for the OCM reaction, as compared with the above mentioned metals; not only in a single oxide but also as promoter. However, after the publi- cation of the review some reports on the promoting effect of Group V metals for the OCM reaction have been published. For example, Aika et al. [ 15 ] reported on the effect of addition of vanadium oxide (5-20 tool-%) to SrCO3 on the OCM reaction. Yuan et al. [ 16] studied the catalytic activity for a series of Li/La/Me mixed oxides (Me = Ti, V, Cr, etc.) prepared by conventional impregnation or coprecipitation methods. Gervasini et al. [ 17] investigated the catalytic perform-. ance of alkali/alkaline earth (CaO or MgO)/vanadium catalyst. The catalyst M. Yamamura et al. /Applied Catal)'sis A: General 122 (1995) 135 149 137 included an inert oxide (A1203, SiO2, TiO2, or ZrO~) as a support to stabilize the active phases. The catalysts were examined by electron spin resonance (ESR) and UV-visible spectroscopy to determine the role of vanadium in the catalyst. With respect to niobium, Ross et al. [ 18] have investigated in detail the use of niobia as oxidation catalysts for hydrocarbons. They found that the catalytic activity of a niobia-promoted Li/MgO or Li/Na/MgO catalyst for the OCM reaction increased slightly, probably due to the formation of a LiNbO3 phase, whereas the C2 selectivity remained almost constant. It was also reported that the addition of Nb205 to both Li/MgO and Li/Na/MgO improved the C2 selectivity and C2 yield at lower temperatures compared with the unpromoted materials [ 19]. Swaan et al. [20] studied the promoting effect of niobium in a Li/MgO catalyst for the OCM reaction in detail. They found that a Li/Nb/MgO catalyst with 16 wt.-% niobium showed the highest activity for C2 production in the OCM reaction and the activity at 873 K was ten times higher than that of the Li/MgO catalyst at the same temperature. They have indicated that two niobium-containing phases, LiNbO3 and Li3NbO4, are formed; the first of these probably causes the increased activity. Aging experiments showed that the activity of the catalyst was lost if the catalyst was used at > 993 K (the melting point of the lithium carbonate phase). In addition, as examples of catalysts containing niobium or tantalum, CaO/ Nb205 catalyst [ 21 ], La203 containing Nb205 [ 22] and a TiO2 catalyst doped with Nb205 or Ta205 [ 23 ] have been reported. We have also systematically investigated the catalytic performance for the OCM reaction of binary and ternary metal oxide catalysts, including Group V metals, viz. vanadium, niobium and tantalum. When these metals are added to Group I metals, Group I/Group II or Group I/Group III catalysts which are already known to have catalytic activity for the OCM reaction, a remarkable increase in catalytic perform- ance is observed [24]. The catalytic performance of Group I/Group V binary catalysts and their physicochemical properties were reported elsewhere [25], in which we obtained the following conclusions; (a) the C2+ selectivity of catalysts with a Group I/Group V atomic ratio of 1:0.3 was higher than that for a 1:1 ratio, (b) different complex metal oxides were produced according to the change in the atomic ratio under the calcination or reaction conditions and the catalytic perform- ance was related to their crystalline structure. The catalytic performance and the role of Group V metals in the ternary metal oxide catalysts of Groups I, III and V metal oxides, however, have not been reported yet. Therefore, the present report will provide the results on using ternary catalysts for the OCM reaction. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts are also investigated and are discussed in relation with the catalytic performance. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of catalysts Group I metals (Li, Na and K, sometimes denoted by alkali metal), Group III metals (Sc, Y, La, Ce and Sm) and Group V metals (V, Nb, Ta) were used to 138 M. Yamamura et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 122 (1995) 135-149 prepare ternary mixed metal oxide catalysts. The ternary mixed oxides will be denoted as Na/xLa/yNb, where x and y are atomic ratios of La/Na and Nb/Na, respectively. The catalysts were prepared in the following manner using commercially avail- able reagents (guaranteed grade) of alkali carbonates or oxides of Group III or V metals. The appropriate amounts of Group III and V metal oxides were put into an alumina crucible. Then an aqueous alkali carbonate solution was added and well mixed. After evaporation at 373-433 K, the compound was heated at 673 K for 1 h, followed by calcination at 1173 K for 10 h in air. 2.2. Oxidative coupling reaction Oxidative coupling of methane was carried out using a conventional fixed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. Catalyst powder ( 1 g) was plugged in the center of the alumina reactor (I.D. = 9 mm, length -- 550 mm) with quartz wool. A reaction gas mixture of methane and oxygen (CH4/O2 molar ratio -- 9) was introduced into the reactor at a flow-rate of 100 mlNTP/min. The reactor was heated to a reaction temperature of 1023 K or 1073 K within 30 min using an electric furnace. After a reaction time of about 1 h, part of the effluent gas was introduced into an on-line gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-8AT) for analysis. The products with carbon number of more than two (ethane, ethylene and C3 hydrocarbons) are defined as C2 + hydrocarbons hereafter. A stability test using the Na/La/0.2Nb catalyst was performed at 1023 K for a total of 250 h under the same conditions as above. The test was operated continu- ously for the first 100 h. However, for the next 150 h it was operated intermittently; that is, the OCM reaction was performed only during daytime for 8-10 h and at night the reactor was cooled down to room temperature under a flow of nitrogen; the next day the OCM reaction was continued; this was repeated until a cumulative OCM reaction time of 150 h was obtained. 2.3. Characterization of catalysts X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured with a Rint 1200 type diffrac- tometer (Rigaku) using monochromatic Cu Kc~ radiation (40 kV and 36 mA). The structure of catalyst was identified by the JCPDS Powder Diffraction File [ 26]. Specific surface areas were determined by the BET method with krypton at 77 K using an automatic gas adsorption apparatus, Belsorp type 36 (Bel Japan, Inc.). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were measured by means of an ESCA Lab MK 5 (VG Scientific) using Mg Kc~ radiation ( 10 kV and 20 mA). Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) profiles were obtained with a TPD spectrum analyzer (Ohkura Riken) using carbon dioxide as a probe. An amount of 0.5 g of sample was put into a quartz test tube and air was replaced by helium at a temperature of 373 K. Then the sample was heated to 1273 K at a rate of 10 K/ M. Yamamura et al. /Applied Catalysis A.\" General 122 (1995) 135-149 139 min. After cooling to 373 K, carbon dioxide was adsorbed in a flow of carbon dioxide for 30 min. Again carbon dioxide was replaced by helium and the sample was heated from 373 K to 1073 K with the same rate of temperature rise. Desorbed gas was analyzed by a mass spectrometer with a quadruple pole. The amount of desorbed carbon dioxide was calculated based on the peaks of mass number 44. 3. Results 3.1. Effect of addition of Group V metals to binary catalysts of Groups I and III metals Ternary catalysts of Group I/Group III/Group V with an atomic ratio of 1:1:0.3 were prepared and the OCM reaction was carried out at 1023 K. The catalysts of Group I/Group V with an atomic ratio of 1:0.3 showed a higher performance for the reaction than those with a ratio of 1:1, as we reported earlier [ 25], which is the reason why the atomic ratio of 1:0.3 was used. This will also be confirmed in this paper. In Fig. 1 is shown the performance of the ternary catalysts of Na/La/Group V metal. In this figure the performance of Na/La catalyst (atomic ratio = 1:1 ) in the absence of Group V metals is also shown. The methane conversion of all Group V metal-added catalysts remarkably increased compared with that of the catalyst without a Group V metal. Of the ternary catalysts, the tantalum-added catalyst gave the highest methane conversion of 18.3%, followed by vanadium- and niobium- added catalysts (16%). On the other hand, C2+ selectivity was less effected by adding Group V metals. The C2 + selectivity of the niobium-added catalyst is 74.1%, which is the highest but almost equal to that of the catalyst without a Group V metal, whereas those of vanadium- and tantalum-added catalysts are 69.4% and [] CH4 Conversion [] 02H4 Selectivity [] C2H6 Selectivity [] C3 Selectivity Methane Conversion / % 0 10 20 0 50 100 Selectivity / % Fig. 1.

The C2+ yield of Group V metal-added catalysts was in the order of Na/La/0.3 Ta (12.6%), Na/La/0.3Nb (11.9%) and Na/La/0.3 V (11.1%). The performance of Na/Group III/0.3Nb catalysts in which Sc, Y, La, Ce, Sm were used for Group III metals was examined. Niobium was used as Group V metal in this experiment because it gave the highest C2 + selectivity in the ternary catalysts of Na/La/Group V metals as described above. The results are shown in Fig. 2. A Na/0.3Nb catalyst without a Group III metal showed very low methane conversion of only 4.3 % with C2 + selectivity of 54%. The addition of Group III metals resulted in an increase in the methane conversion up to > 14%. The highest conversion was obtained by the addition of yttrium (17.0%), followed by lanthanum (16.0%). The addition of the metals to the Na/0.3Nb catalyst is favorable for enhancement of C2 + selectivity. All Group III metals enhanced the C2 + selectivity above 70% and the highest value was obtained with lanthanum (74.1%). Fig. 3 shows the performance of Group I metals (Li, Na, K)/La/0.3Nb catalysts. The methane conversions of sodium- and potassium-added catalysts were almost equal, 16.0% and 15.9%, respectively, whereas that of lithium was lower (14.4%). On the other hand, the order of C2+ selectivity was Na(74.1%)= Li(74.1%) > K(69.3%). Both methane conversion and C2 + selectivity were found to be higher than those of La/0.3Nb catalyst without a Group I metal. Summarizing the above results, the highest performance was obtained with the catalyst consisting of sodium, lanthanum and niobium, which is also stable, as will be described later. Therefore, further investigation was concentrated on this ternary catalytic system. M.

Effect of the composition of Na/xLa/yNb catalysts on the OCM reaction The effect of the composition of each metal for the Na/xLa/yNb catalytic system on the activity and C2+ selectivity for the OCM reaction was investigated. Fig. 4 shows the relationship between the activity (methane and oxygen conversions) and C2+ selectivity with the catalysts of La/Na atomic ratio(x) = 1 and Nb/Na ratio(y) =0-1, in which y=0 and 1 denote the Na/La and Na/La/Nb catalysts, respectively. The methane and oxygen conversion both increased with the increase in Nb/Na ratio in the range of y = 0-0.15, but reached a plateau at y > 0.15. Whereas C2 + selectivity showed a constant value of 75% at y = 0--0.3, it decreased at y > 0.3. It is found that the optimal addition of niobium to the Na/La catalyst gives a remarkable increase in the activity for the OCM reaction while the C2 + selectivity too ,,,,~ .~ ~ It 8O .>__ '~ 60 o3 ~ , ~ 40 P, o 20 0 0 , I , i , J , i , i ~ 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 Nb/Na Atomic Ratio(y) Fig. 4.

Conditions: catalyst= 1 g, temperature= 1023 K, CH4/O2=9, flow-rate = 100 mlNTP/min. remains constant. However, the C2+ selectivity decreases when niobium is added excessively. In Fig. 5 is shown the catalytic performance for the catalysts of x= 0-5 and y = 0.3, in which x = 0 denotes the Na/0.3Nb catalyst, as well as that for the La/ 0.3Nb catalyst. The conversions of methane and oxygen increased with the increase in La/Na ratio up to x = 0.67, but at x > 0.67 they remained constant. This indicates that the addition of lanthanum to the Na/0.3Nb catalyst increases the activity for the reaction. The C2 + selectivity passes through a maximum at x = 1.5. However, the excess addition of lanthanum to the Na/0.3Nb catalyst slightly decreases the C2+ selectivity. The selectivity decreases further in the absence of sodium (La/ 0.3Nb). Thus, the addition of sodium to the La/0.3Nb catalyst increases the C2+ selectivity. In order to clarify the effect of addition of niobium to the Na/La catalyst, the OCM reaction was performed with Na/xLa catalysts of x = 1-10 in the absence of niobium. The results are shown in Table 1 together with that of La203. The con- versions of methane and especially oxygen both increased with x, viz. the content of lanthanum. The conversions at x = 10 were almost equal to those of La203. By contrast, the C2+ selectivity at x = 1-10 was almost constant (about 75%). How- ever, it decreased to about 63% in the absence of sodium, indicating that the addition of sodium to La203 increases the C2+ selectivity.

Conditions: catalyst = 1 g, temperature = 1023 K, CH~/O2 = 9, flow-rate = 100 mlNTP/min. Comparing the results in Table 1 and Fig. 5, it is found that the activity of niobium-added catalyst is two times higher than that of the Na/La catalyst with almost constant C2 + selectivity. This indicates that the addition of niobium to the Na/La catalyst results in the increase in the conversions of methane and oxygen without decreasing the C2 + selectivity. It is concluded that the addition of an appropriate amount of niobium to the Na/ La catalyst increases the activity with no decrease in the C2 + selectivity, whereas excess of niobium decreases the C2+ selectivity. The preferable atomic ratio of Nb/Na is in y=0.15-0.3, especially in the range of y=0.15-0.2, in which the highest catalytic performance was obtained, viz. a methane conversion of > 15% and a C2 + selectivity of > 76%. 3.3. Life test of the Na/La/O.2Nb catalyst A life test of the Na/La/Nb ternary catalytic system was carried out using a freshly prepared Na/La/0.2Nb catalyst ( 1 g) which was chosen on the basis of the above results. The test was operated continuously for 100 h at 1023 K, followed by another 150 h intermittently at the same reaction conditions. The effect of time- on-stream on the conversions of methane and oxygen as well as on the C2 + selec- tivity are shown in Fig. 6. During the continuous operation of 100 h, both the conversions and C2+ selectivity remained almost constant, indicating that the cat- alyst was very stable. A significant decrease in the C2 + selectivity but no decrease in any of the conversions were observed during the next intermittent operation. 3.4. Crystalline structure of Na/La/yNb catalysts The XRD patterns of the Na/La/yNb catalytic system with varying content of niobium are shown in Fig. 7. The XRD patterns changed with the increase in Nb/ 144 M.

In addition to the peaks of La203, those of La3NbO7 became larger at y/> 0.2. With a further increase in niobium, the intensity of the La203 peaks decreased, and only the peaks of La3NbO7 were observed at y = 0.4. The La3NbO7 crystal was also the main component in the Na/La/Nb catalyst (y = 1 ), the XRD pattern of which is not shown in Fig. 7. Consequently, the content of La203 crystal decreased with the increase of the amount of niobium added and conversely the content of the complex lanthanum-niobium oxides increased. As clearly seen in Fig. 7, peaks assigned to any compound based on sodium were not observed. 3.5. Surface properties of Na/La/yNb catalysts The BET specific surface area of La203 was 1.45 m2/g. Adding niobium to La203 with a Nb/La ratio of 0.3 increased the area to 2.60 m2/g, but the addition of sodium to the La/0.3Nb catalyst decreased it to 1.40 m2/g. An XPS elemental analysis of the surface of the Na/La and Na/La/yNb catalysts (y = 0.05-1 ) was carried out. The spectrum of the Na/La/Nb catalyst is shown in Fig. 8. The peak of Nb 3d decreased with the decrease in the amount of niobium added. Table 2 shows the relative compositions (La atom= 1) on the surface, which are calculated based on the spectra of each catalyst. Since the spectrum of O 1 s included two peaks due to oxides and carbonates, they were divided by drawing a vertical line against the abscissa of the spectrum through the valley of the two peaks. In Table 2 only the concentration of the former is shown. The Na:La ratios on the surface of the Na/La, Na/La/0.05Nb and Na/La/Nb catalysts are higher than those of the values at the preparation of the catalysts, namely 1, whereas those of the Na/La/0.2Nb and Na/La/0.3Nb catalysts are equal to or less than those at M.

The Nb:La ratios on the surface of the Na/La/0.05Nb and Na/ La/Nb catalysts are almost equal to those during preparation, but those of the Na/ La/0.2Nb and Na/La/0.3Nb catalysts are about half of those during preparation. In Table 2 are also shown XPS analysis data of the Na/La/0.2Nb catalyst after the life test. The content of sodium after continuous operation for 100 h slightly decreased, but became about half of that of the fresh catalyst after the total 250 h, indicating that sodium on the surface was vaporized under the high-temperature conditions. The content of niobium was not changed after the life test. 3.6. TPD of carbon dioxide The TPD spectra of carbon dioxide were measured to obtain information on the properties of base sites of the Na/La/Nb catalytic system. As seen from Fig. 9, two carbon dioxide desorption peaks were observed at 473 K and 673 K in La203, which are referred hereafter as peak A and B, respectively.

On the other hand, when adding sodium to La203 (Na/La catalyst), peak A significantly decreased with a slight shift to lower temperature. Peak B seen in the spectrum of La203 disappeared. Instead, a large peak at > 923 K (peak C) was observed. In the Na/La/0.3Nb catalyst, peak A became somewhat larger and wider compared with that of the Na/La catalyst. However, the trends in carbon dioxide desorption at higher temperature were similar to those of the Na/ La catalyst. The Na/La/Nb catalyst with the highest niobium content gave only a large peak A, which is different from the other catalysts. 4. Discussion 4.1. The role of each metal in the Na/La/Nb ternao\" catalytic system In the case of the Na/La/Nb ternary catalytic system, it is confirmed that La203 shows high performance for OCM reaction as already reported [9-11]. When adding sodium to La203, the C2 + selectivity increases but the activity (conversions of methane and oxygen) decreases. On the other hand, the addition of niobium gives no effect on the catalytic performance of La203, whereas niobium increases the activity without any change of C2 + selectivity when added to the Na/La catalyst. These facts suggest that Group V metals such as niobium enhance the conversion M. Yamamura et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 122 (1995) 135 149 147 of methane and alkali metals such as sodium diminish the deep oxidation of methane to carbon oxides. 4.2. Catalytic performance and cr3,stalline structure of Na/xLa/yNb catalysts The XRD patterns in Fig. 7 indicate that lanthanum exists as La203 and La3NbO7, and niobium as La3NbO7 in the Na/xLa/yNb catalysts. The XPS spectra of La 3d and Nb 3d of the Na/xLa/yNb catalysts shown in Fig. 8 are similar to those of authentic samples of La203 and Nb2Os, respectively. This suggests that the valences of lanthanum and niobium in the catalysts are 3 + and 5 +, respectively, and supports the assignment by XRD. Although no crystalline structure including sodium was observed in the XRD patterns, the existence of sodium in the catalysts was confirmed in the XPS spectra in which peaks of Na ls and Na(Auger) were observed. This suggests that sodium is on the surface or in the bulk of catalysts in the form of compounds such as amorphous Na20. As described before, the performance of the Na/La/yNb catalysts for the OCM reaction is highest at a Nb/Na atomic ratio(y) of 0.15-0.3 and the C2 + selectivity decreases when y is outside this range. Comparing this result and the assignment of the crystalline structure, it is found that the highest activity and C2+ selectivity are obtained for the catalysts in which both La203 and La3NbO7 are observed. The activity is low in the absence of La3NbO7 as was shown for the Na/La catalyst, whereas the C2 + selectivity is low in the presence of only La3NbO7 which is the case for the Na/La/0.4Nb catalyst. It is an interesting phenomenon that a complex metal oxide is produced by adding niobium to the Na/La catalyst and the catalytic performance is changed with the change in the niobium content. This is probably due to the change of active sites, which will be discussed later. 4.3. Stabilio' of the Na/La/O.2Nb catalyst The life test of the Na/La/0.2Nb catalyst showed almost no change in the catalytic performance during the first continuous operation for 100 h. However, during the next intermittent operation for 150 h the C2+ selectivity decreased significantly with almost no change in the activity. The XPS analysis has revealed that the Na:La ratio on the surface is decreased to 0.35, about 40% of the fresh catalyst, after the total 250 h life test. However, only a slight decrease was observed after 100 h (Table 2). The C2+ selectivity decreased from 76% to 67% during the test. As described earlier, the existence of sodium on the surface is an important factor for C2 + selectivity. Therefore, the decrease in the C2 + selectivity during the life test can be ascribed to the decrease in sodium concentration on the surface of the catalyst (Table 2). As described earlier, the C2+ selectivity was increased by adding sodium to La203, but excess sodium decreased the conversions of methane and oxygen. Therefore, a small amount of sodium is desirable to keep high conversions and C2 + 148 M. gamamura et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 122 (1995) 135 149 selectivity. However, since sodium vaporizes continuously under the reaction con- ditions, the addition of a large amount of sodium is preferable in order to prolong the catalyst life. We suggest that this contradiction is resolved by adding small amounts of niobium. Our results described in this paper are in contrast with the results obtained by Swaan et al. [20] as regards the stability of Nb-containing catalysts. They reported that the Li/Nb/MgO catalyst was very unstable at >993 K (melting point of lithium carbonate phase) and lost its activity for the OCM reaction rapidly with a sharp decrease in Nb-containing phases, viz. LiNbO3 and Li3NbO4. Instead of lithium and MgO, our catalytic system contains sodium and lanthanum, which must stabilize the catalysts containing niobium. 4.4. The relationship between the surface properties and catalytic performance of Na/La/yNb catalysts As described before, the catalytic performance of Na/La/yNb for the OCM reaction relates with the presence of the two oxides, that is, catalysts with both La203 and La3NbO7 crystals show a high activity and C2+ selectivity. The two oxides coexist at a Nb/Na atomic ratio of 0.15-0.3, at which ratio the highest catalytic performance was obtained. From the TPD spectra shown in Fig. 9, the following observations were done; (a) when adding sodium to La203, the carbon dioxide desorption peak at high temperature (peak B for La203) disappeared, but a new peak at > 923 K (peak C) was observed. (b) the new peak C was not observed when niobium was added to the Na/La catalyst at the Nb/Na atomic ratio of 1. (c) the intensity of the peak at low temperature (peak A) decreased when adding sodium, but increased with addition of niobium. These observations indicate that original base sites of La203 are lost but new strong sites are generated when sodium is added to La203 (Na/La catalyst). These sites are undoubtedly produced by the interaction of sodium and La203, because they are not observed in the absence of La203 (Na/La/Nb catalyst). These strong base sites may be responsible for the increase in the C2+ selectivity, whereas the oxidation ability of La203 is decreased probably because the original active sites of La203 are covered with a large amount of sodium on the surface (Table 2). When adding niobium to the Na/La catalyst, a part of La203 is transformed to La3NbOv. This leads to an increase in the activity for the OCM reaction (Fig. 4). The C2 + selectivity remains at a high level of more than 75% up to a Nb/Na ratio of 0.3 in which La203 coexists with La3NbOT, but it decreases to below 65%, when new base sites diminish with the further increase in niobium content as seen in the Na/La/0.4Nb catalyst. The highest activity and C2+ selectivity were obtained with a good balance of La203 and La3NbO7 which was observed in the range of the Nb/Na atomic ratio of 0.15-0.3. M. Yamamura et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 122 (1995) 135-149 149 5. Conclusions The following conclusions are drawn from the results of oxidative coupling of methane over ternary catalysts of Group I/Group III/Group V metals. (1) The C2+ selectivity is increased but the methane conversion is decreased when alkali metals are added to Group III metals. However, with the optimal addition of Group V metals to the Na/La catalyst, a high catalytic performance is obtained, and the activity is prolonged for more than 100 h. (2) The highest performance of the Na/ La/Nb catalytic system was obtained at atomic ratios of La/Na and Nb/Na of 1 and 0.15-0.3, respectively, giving a methane conversion of 15.1-16.0% and a C2 + selectivity of 74.1-76.3%. ( 3 ) New base sites produced by adding sodium to La203 increased the C2+ selectivity. The addition of niobium to the Na/La catalyst increased the catalytic activity as a result of the change of a part of La203 to La3NbO7. However, when all of the La203 was changed to La3NbO7, the C2+ selectivity decreased remarkably because of the disappearance of new base sites. The highest catalytic performance was observed when a good balance of La203 and La3NbO7 at the Nb/Na atomic ratio of 0.15-0.3 was established. References [ 1 ] G.E. Keller and M.M. Bhasin, J.

Ternary metal oxides consisting of Group I (alkali metals)/Group III/Group V metals with an atomic ratio of 1:1:0.3 were prepared and their catalytic performance for the oxidative coupling of methane as well as their physicochemical properties were investigated. When adding Group V metals to Group I/Group III binary catalysts, a noticeable increase in the conversions of methane and oxygen was observed without any change in C2+ selectivity. Of the ternary metal oxide catalysts, a Na/La/0.3Nb metal oxide showed the highest performance, viz. a methane conversion of 16.0% and a C2+ selectivity of 74.1% at 1023 K under atmospheric pressure with a total gas flow-rate of 100 ml NTP/min (CH4/O2molar ratio= 9). The stability test using a Na/La/0.2Nb catalyst, which was performed under the same conditions as above, showed that the catalyst was very stable with no decrease in methane conversion and C2+ selectivity for more than 100 h. The crystalline structure, the surface composition and properties of base sites of Na/La/Nb oxide catalysts were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of carbon dioxide. The catalytic performance of the Na/La/Nb mixed oxides depended on the ratio of the two crystalline phases of La2O3 and La3NbO7. When sodium was added to La2O3 with aLa/Na ratio of 1, new base sites were produced, resulting in an increase in the C2+ selectivity with a significant decrease in methane conversion. The methane conversion was increased by adding a small amount of niobium to theNa/La catalyst, resulting in a change of part of the La2O3 to La3NbO7. However, when all of the La2O3 was changed to La3NbO7, the C2+ selectivity decreased due to the lack of new base sites. A good balance of both crystals (La2O3 and La3NbO7) may be obtained at aNb/Na atomic ratio of 0.15–0.3, which optimizes the catalytic performance of the mixed oxides.
