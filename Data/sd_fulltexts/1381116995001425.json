Darensbourg *, Nicole White Stafford, Takumi Katsurao Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, USA Received 6 April 1994 Abstract Supercritical carbon dioxide was found to be a suitable substitute for halogenated organic solvents in its copolymerization with propylene oxide. The system was studied utilizing a heterogenous catalyst, zinc glutarate. The polymers were analyzed for selectivity in polycarbonate linkages by 'H NMR spectroscopy and for molecular weight by gel permeation chromatography. Keywords: Supercritical CO2; Carbon dioxide; Propylene oxide; Zinc carboxylate catalyst 1. Introduction Supercritical fluids (SCF's) exhibit unique physicochemical properties, such as density, diffusivity, dielectric constant, solvating strength, an viscosity that can be adjusted by varying temperature and pressure, and are, thus, potentially very useful solvents for chemical reactions [ 1 ] . Supercritical carbon dioxide is particularly advantageous because it has a relatively low critical temperature and pressure (Tc = 304.2 K and P,=1056 psi) and is non-flammable, inexpensive, and less of a health hazard than most organic solvents. Since the region around the critical point is one of rapid changes of properties, a supercritical fluid provides greater flexibility as a reaction medium than more conventional organic solvents for * Corresponding author. 1381-1169/95/$09.50 995 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDI1381-1169(95)00142-5 polymerization reactions, e.g. increasing pressure can result in an increase in polymerization rate and molar mass, and polymer processing [ 2 ] . In polymer processing SCF's allow for the extraction of low molecular weight contaminants and the fractionation of polymers by molecular weight and composition [ 3 ] . The interest in exploiting SCF's as a reaction medium for polymerization reactions has focused on using the tunability of their solvent power to control the precipitation threshold for polymer chains, swelling in the precipitate phase, molecular weight, and molecular weight distribution [ 2 ] . Most of the work reported in the literature concerns free radical polymerizations with the high-pressure, high-temperature polymerization of ethylene being the most well-known example [4]. However, polymers formed in inert SCF's have often been characterized by low yields and heterogeneous conditions at low conversions [ 2 ] . L2 D.J. Darensbourg et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalvcis A: Chemical l(1995) Ll-L4 Inoue et al. first reported the alternating copolymerization of carbon dioxide and epoxides using Zn (CH2CH3) 2 and H20 in 1969 [ 5 ] . Previously, Stevens had reported the co-polymerization of ethylene oxide and carbon dioxide in the presence of polyhydric phenols initially under supercritical conditions. However, the polymers formed were viscous liquids or waxes characterized by large sections of polyether linkages with three to ten carbonate units per molecule [6] . Since then various other catalysts [ 7 ] have been found for this polymerization with the most active being those prepared by the reaction of zinc oxide with dicarboxylic acids [ 8 ] . These reactions are very sensitive to proton donors due to a chain transfer mechanism [ 9 ] . The accepted mechanism for this reaction involves epoxide addition to a metal carbonate (or carboxylate for initiation) with subsequent C02 addition to a metal alkoxide. This paper reports on the co-polymerization of propylene oxide and carbon dioxide to form pol- Table 1 Copolymerization of propylene oxide (P.O.) and carbon dioxide' ycarbonates in supercritical carbon dioxide utilizing zinc glutarate as a heterogeneous catalyst. 2.

The reactor is charged with the appropriate amount of distilled propylene oxide and co-solvent, heated to 40, 60, or 85, and raised to the appropriate pressure with bone dry carbon dioxide (Eq. 2) 2. The results are shown in Table 1. The presence of propylene carbonate, a cyclic monomer, was detected by the presence of a peak at 1800 cm-' in the infrared spectrum and by NMR spectroscopy. Increasing the temperature increases the production of this byproduct, as well as the relative percentage of polyether linkages. catalyst C02 + O O II -(O-C-OCH(CF~)CH2),~-(OCH(CH3)CH2)m + c(~ Supercritical C02 is a suitable substitute for organic solvents in polymerization reactions in which C02 is also a reactant. The presence of an organic solvent under supercritical carbon dioxide, such as hexane or acetonitrile, significantly decreases the yield of polymer isolated but increases the fraction of carbonate linkages relative to ether linkages while the use of methylene chloride as co-solvent increases the selectivity for forming polycarbonates without this adverse impact on the yield. The use of C02 (at pressures greater than 700 psi) as solvent also resulted in high selectivity for polycarbonate versus polyether formation. Furthermore, the advantage of using supercritical carbon dioxide is that it is as effective a solvent as methylene chloride for the copolymerization process, yet it is environmentally benign. 2 The supercritical pressures were reached utilizing bone dry carbon dioxide equipped with a full length diptube and helium headspace and a Milton Roy Simplex minipump Solvent Delivery System from LDC Analytical. The head of the pump was equipped with a cooling jacket which was cooled to - 15.
