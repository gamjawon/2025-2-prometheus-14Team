Graphical abstract Magnetic nanocrystalline spinel-type cobalt ferrite complex oxides were prepared at different molar ratios of CoII to FeIII and well characterized. These samples show high catalytic activities for heterogeneous oxidation of cyclohexane with molecular oxygen without any solvents or reductants. When pure CoFe2O4 was used as catalyst, 16.2% of cyclohexane conversion and 92.4% of selectivity for cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol were obtained. The catalyst could be easily separated by an external magnet and no obvious loss of activity was observed when it was reused in five consecutive runs. Magnetic nanocrystalline spinel-type cobalt ferrite complex oxides were prepared by a simple sol–gel auto-combustion method at five different molar ratios of CoII to FeIII (1:4.0, 1:2.8, 1:2.0, 1:1.5, and 1:1.1) and characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry (FT-IR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Their catalytic performance was evaluated in the oxidation of cyclohexane with oxygen as oxidant in the presence of neither solvents nor reducing agents. It has been revealed that the catalysts had high catalytic activities for heterogeneous oxidation of cyclohexane. Especially, when pure CoFe2O4 was used as catalyst; excellent results with turnover number of 288 and 92.4% selectivity for cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol was obtained under 1.6MPa of initial oxygen pressure at 418K after 6.0h of reaction. The influences of initial oxygen pressure, reaction temperature, reaction time, and free-radical initiator on the oxidation of cyclohexane over CoFe2O4 were investigated. The catalyst can be easily separated by an external magnet and no obvious loss of activity was observed when reused in five consecutive runs. CoFe2O4 was proved to be also efficient for oxidation of linear alkanes. Keywords Magnetic nanocrystals CoFe2O4 spinel Oxygen Cyclohexane oxidation 1 Introduction Although there have been major advances in the oxidation of hydrocarbons with molecular oxygen, the development of effective and selective methods for the catalytic functionalization of inactive carbon–hydrogen bonds in saturated hydrocarbons still remains a major challenge in oxidation chemistry [1,2]. Of particular importance is the oxidation of cyclohexane due to the large demand for cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol (K/A oil), which are important raw materials for the production of adipic acid and caprolactam finally used in the manufacture of nylon-6 and nylon-66 polymers [3,4]. However, the oxidation of cyclohexane turns out to be the least efficient of all major industrial processes [5]. The present industrial process for cyclohexane oxidation is carried out around 423K and 1–2MPa pressure employing metal cobalt salt or metal-boric acid as homogeneous catalyst worldwide. The drawback of this process is that the oxidation must be operated in 3–6% conversion of cyclohexane to maintain high selectivity (75–80%) for the K/A oil [6]. Great efforts have been devoted to the oxidation of cyclohexane in the past years [4,7–16]. However, owing to the employment of large amounts of solvents and/or reducing agents as well as harsh reaction conditions, it is still difficult to apply these technologies to industrial processes [7–10,17,18]. So the great demand for these oxidation products and the high-energy intensity of the present process warrant a replacement with a more effective catalytic process. Oxidation of cyclohexane heterogeneously with molecular oxygen without any solvents or reducing agents is particularly desirable from both economical and environmental aspects. Transition metal oxides are known for their redox properties and capacity to catalyze the oxidation of hydrocarbons [19–21]. In the last two decades, considerable applied as well as fundamental research efforts have been spent on the activation and the functionalization of hydrocarbons catalyzed by transition metal oxides [22–25]. In particular, nanosized materials have attracted great interests in recent years due to their well-known specific physical and chemical properties [12,21]. Nanoparticles of complex metal oxides such as spinel ferrites are thermally and chemically stable. The nanoparticles possess great potentials for application in catalysis, gas sensors, high quality ceramics and super paramagnetic materials [26–31]. The properties of these materials mainly depend on their shape, size, and structure, which are strongly determined by the synthetic processes. Among the many synthetic methods proposed, the sol–gel auto-combustion route, as a unique combination of the combustion and the chemical gelation process, is preferred in general because of its main advantages of inexpensive precursors, short preparation time, modest heating and relatively simple manipulations [30,32,33]. Cobalt ferrite, CoFe2O4, as a well-known spinel ferrite and hard magnetic material, has attracted much attention on its very high cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy, high coercivity, and moderate saturation magnetization in recent years [28–31,34]. However, only a few efforts have been devoted to its catalytic activity [35–37]. In this work, nanocrystalline cobalt ferrite samples were prepared by a modified sol–gel auto-combustion method at different Co:Fe ratios, and their catalytic abilities in the oxidation of cyclohexane with oxygen as oxidant in a solvent-free system without any additives were investigated. High conversion and selectivity were obtained. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and equipments Cyclohexane and toluene were purified before use. Other reagents were of analytical grade and were used as received. FT-IR spectra were measured on a Nexus 870 FT-IR spectrophotometer. XRD patterns of the samples were collected using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. TEM micrographs were obtained using a Hitachi H-600 microscope. The oxidation products were determined by an HP 6890/5973 GC/MS instrument and quantified by an Agilent 6820 gas chromatograph using toluene as internal standard. 2.2 Preparation of cobalt ferrite nanocrystals The nanocrystalline cobalt ferrite complex oxides were prepared according to a modified procedure in the literature [30]. In a typical procedure, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and citric acid were completely dissolved in distilled water with a 1:1 ratio of metal (CoII +FeIII) to citric acid. The solution was allowed to evaporate in an oil bath under continuous stirring at 80–90°C until a brown gel formed. After the reaction, the formed gel was dried at 110°C for 1h and a spumous xerogel was obtained. When the produced xerogel was ignited at 650°C, a self-propagating combustion process occurred and a dark grey fluey product was obtained after it combusted completely. Five samples with different ratios of Co to Fe: 1:4.0, 1:2.8, 1:2.0, 1:1.5, and 1:1.1 were prepared as described above and designated as cats. 1–5, respectively. The samples were ground finely and then used to catalyze the oxidation of cyclohexane with molecular oxygen. 2.3 Characterization of the catalysts The XRD patterns of the samples is in agreement with the standard XRD pattern for cobalt ferrite (JCPDS NO. 22-1086), showing the presence of spinel ferrite phase (Fig. 1 ). It also shows clearly that pure spinel ferrite was obtained only when the stoichiometric molar ratio of Co to Fe was used (cat. 3), and a small amount of Fe2O3 or Co2O3 coexists with the spinel ferrite in other nonstoichiometric samples (cats. 1, 2 and 4, 5). The mean particle sizes of the samples calculated by applying the Sherrer equation to [311] reflections are 34, 29, 27, 25, and 21nm for cats. 1–5, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the FT-IR spectra of the five samples. A strong band associated with the Fe–O stretching vibration at 581, 574, 585, 583 and 577cm−1 for cats. 1–5 is presented. It confirms the presence of the cobalt ferrite phase [32]. No characteristic bands corresponding to citric acid or NO3 − appeared, and this indicates that no citric acid or NO3 − is residual in the samples. The purpose of using nonstoichiometric molar ratios of Co to Fe is to prepare corresponding nonstoichiometric spinel ferrite. Unexpectedly, there is no shift in the spinel peak positions or IR; furthermore, the XRD peaks for the Fe2O3 or Co2O3 that form from a nonstoichiometric reaction mixture are on the same order of intensity as that for the spinel, so it seems likely that only the stoichiometric CoFe2O4 is formed, and any excess of either Co or Fe just goes to make the corresponding oxide. The TEM micrographs of cat. 3 and cat. 1 are shown in Fig. 3 as representations. The samples of cats. 3–5 are very similar (Fig. 3A): they show nanoparticles with an irregular morphology and a broad particle size distribution ranging from around 15–20 to 50–60nm, with a high percentage of small particles (25–35nm). More regular spherical shape and particle size (in the range of 35–40nm) distribution were observed for the samples of cats. 1 and 2 (Fig. 3B). It is clear that the samples have particle agglomeration forms. 2.4 Oxidation of cyclohexane The oxidation of cyclohexane was performed in a 30mL stainless steel autoclave equipped with a magnetic stirrer and an automatic temperature controller. In a typical reaction, 5.0mg catalyst and 4.0mL (37.3mmol) cyclohexane were added to the autoclave. The autoclave was flushed three times with O2 and pressurized to the desired pressure, and then heated to the desired temperature with stirring. After the reaction, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature and slowly depressurized. The samples were identified by GC–MS and quantified by GC using toluene as internal standard. The main by-products of the reaction are hexanedioic acid, hexanoic acid, dicyclohexyl adipate and cyclohexyl caproate (Scheme 1 ). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalysis tests The results of cyclohexane oxidation over the as-prepared samples are listed in Table 1 , and those over other catalysts are also listed for comparative purpose. As can be seen, the samples have high catalytic activities for oxidation of cyclohexane and high turnover numbers have been obtained. Obviously, the pure CoFe2O4 spinel (entry 3) shows better catalyst activity rather than other samples (entries 1, 2 and 4, 5), probably due to the presence of minor impurities in the latter. It also gave much higher conversion and turnover numbers than homogeneous cobalt acetate (entry 6), industrial cobalt salt and boric acid (entries 7 and 8), nanosized cobalt and iron oxides as well as their mechanical mixture (entries 9–14) while a comparable high selectivity for K/A oil was obtained. Cyclohexane can also be converted in the absence of catalyst under our experimental conditions; however, only a low conversion of 6.1% was obtained (entry 15). In order to investigate the catalytic activity of the nanocrystalline CoFe2O4 spinels, a series of experiments was carried out by choosing pure CoFe2O4 (cat. 3) as catalyst with initial oxygen pressure, reaction temperature, reaction time and free-radical initiator changed. 3.2 Effect of initial oxygen pressure Effect of initial oxygen pressure on the conversion as well as the products distribution of cyclohexane oxidation was investigated in the range of 1.2–2.0MPa. The results are shown in Fig. 4 . As can be seen, with an increase in the initial oxygen pressure, the conversion of cyclohexane increased expectedly. When the initial oxygen pressure was increased from 1.2 to 1.6MPa, the selectivity for cyclohexanol decreased from 23.8 to 16.1%, and that for cyclohexanone increased from 70.5% to its maximum 77.3%. That is cyclohexanol is apt to be further oxidized to cyclohexanone at higher oxygen pressure. A possible reason for the decrease in selectivity for cyclohexanone when oxygen pressure is above 1.6MPa is that cyclohexanone was oxidized deeply to acids and other by-products. The selectivity for K/A oil decreased all along with an increase in the initial oxygen pressure in the investigated range because of more deep oxidation products formed under higher oxygen pressure. 3.3 Effect of reaction temperature Fig. 5 shows the results of cyclohexane oxidation at different temperatures. When the reaction temperature was raised from 140 to 145°C, the conversion of cyclohexane increased sharply from 5.2 to 16.2%, but only a slight increase was shown above 145°C. With increasing temperature, the selectivity for cyclohexanol decreased, and the molar ratio of K/A oil increased, probably due to cyclohexanol being further oxidized to cyclohexanone. As a result, in the range of 140–160°C, the selectivity for cyclohexanol decreased from 37.3% to zero, but that for cyclohexanone increased from 62.7 to 90.6%. In addition, the selectivity for K/A oil decreased from 100 to 90.6% because of more by-products formed at higher temperature. It is also clear that, when the reaction temperature increased from 145 to 150°C, the selectivity for cyclohexanol hardly changed, whereas that for K/A oil decreased by more than 4%. This is due to more cyclohexanone being converted to deep oxidation products; its selectivity also decreased from 77.3 to 72.9%. 3.4 Effect of reaction time Fig. 6 presents the effect of reaction time on cyclohexane oxidation. Obviously, the reaction hardly occurred during the first 2h, which might be the initiation period according to the generally accepted free radical mechanism [38]. After this period, the conversion of cyclohexane exhibited an almost linear increase from 1.2 to 16.2% in an additional 3h and reached 18.3% after 9h of the reaction. When the reaction time was prolonged from 3 to 9h, the selectivity for cyclohexanone increased rapidly from 50.1 to 93.0%, but that for cyclohexanol decreased sharply from 49.8% to zero because cyclohexanol is apt to be oxidized to cyclohexanone and other deep oxidation products. It is also clear that longer reaction time was unfavorable to the selective production of K/A oil because of more by-products formed. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the selectivity for K/A oil decreased from 100 to 93% when the reaction time was prolonged from 2 to 9h. 3.5 Effect of tert-butyl hydroperoxide and acetone Since the reaction had an induction period, the effect of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) and acetone as free-radical initiators was investigated and the results are shown in Table 2 . Obviously, the addition of TBHP greatly enhanced the rate of cyclohexane conversion while a high selectivity for the two desired products cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol was retained. After 2h of reaction, the conversion of cyclohexane with the addition of TBHP reached the level of that with no initiator after 5h of reaction. The reaction can also be initiated by acetone; 7.1% of cyclohexane conversion and 98.8% of selectivity for K/A oil were obtained with the addition of acetone after 2h of reaction, while this was the initiation period for the system without additives (Fig. 6). These facts can afford the evidence that the oxidation of cyclohexane proceeds by a free-radical mechanism. 3.6 Reuse of the catalyst After the reaction, the mixture was poured into a flask and the catalyst can be seen being adsorbed on a magnet. The catalyst together with the magnet can be easily separated by simple decantation after applying a magnetic field on the surface of the flask, and then subjected to the second run under the same conditions. The data obtained are listed in Fig. 7 . The total selectivity changed only slightly after six runs, but the conversion of cyclohexane dropped from 15.5 to 12.7%. The decrease in the activity could be mainly attributed to unavoidable loss of the catalyst during the process of collection. The results confirm that the nanocrystalline CoFe2O4 spinel has good stability and recyclable applicability for the oxidation of cyclohexane with O2 in a solvent-free system. 4 Extension to other substrates The optimal reaction conditions were applied to the oxidation of linear alkanes. The results are listed in Table 3 . Unfortunately, the as-prepared nanocrystalline CoFe2O4 spinel is less effective for the oxidation of linear alkanes under the same conditions. The conversions and selectivities listed in Table 3 are based on the area normalization method, and hence there are probably substantial amounts of by-products not accounted for in the analysis (CO2 very probably is one of the more important ones). So the apparent conversions are possibly artificially low and the selectivities are probably high. 5 Conclusions Spinel cobalt ferrite nanocrystals were prepared by a modified sol–gel auto-combustion route without calcination. The precursor is cheap, and the method is simple and effective. The samples prove to be highly active and easily reusable catalysts for cyclohexane oxidation in a green catalytic system; high turnover numbers and selectivity can be obtained. The pure stoichiometric CoFe2O4 nanocrystal showed optimum catalytic activity; 16.2% of cyclohexane conversion and 92.4% of selectivity for cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol were obtained after 6h of reaction. The catalyst exhibited excellent reusability; when it was reused five times, only a slight loss of the activity was observed and the selectivity was practically unchanged.
