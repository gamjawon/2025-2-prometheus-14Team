(+341)3986697 (Received August 10, 1993 ) Abstract Anionic alkylation of imidazole with alkyl halides to produce intermediates in the synthesis of pharmaceutically important antiviral products, such as famciclovir and acyclovir, have been carried out using alkaline carbons as base catalysts. Previously to the alkylation of imidazole, the condensation of benzaldehyde with malonic esters has been used as test reaction of basicity on a series of lithium, sodium, potassium and cesium exchanged Norit RX 1 Extra activated carbon. The importance of active sites and the measurement of surface basicity have been emphasized. Under reaction conditions, it has been found that most of the basic sites in alkaline carbons have 10.7 < pK.S 13.3, but there is a considerable number of sites able to abstract protons of 13.3 < pK. < 16.5. Norit RX 1 Extra which was not subject to alkaline exchange retains most of its basic sites capable of abstracting protons of 9 < pK. < 10.7. Taking into account that the pK. of the NH group of imidazole is 14.5, the alkaline carbons present the required basic strength to catalyze the alkylation of this N-heterocycle with alkyl halides. Key words: alkaline carbon; alkylation, basicity; imidazole; Knoevenagel condensation Introduction Activated carbons are porous materials which are generally used as adsorbents, catalysts or catalysts supports [ 1 ] . It is well known that activated carbons have acid-base properties, and their acid or base character depends on the history of their formation and the temperature and conditions under which they were oxidized. Attempts have -been made to identify and estimate the surface acidity of acid carbons using several physicochemical techniques [25 ] ; however, these methods have not been employed successfully in the case of basic carbons. Even though the basic properties of many carbon surfaces in solution have been studied [6, 7] and several theories have been proposed [8- *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 0 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved. 254 R.M. Martin-Aranda et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 253-264 12 ] to explain their basic character, the measure of the basic strength distribution and the type of active sites present are still under study. Recently, basic solids able to catalyze reactions selectively have been studied in fine chemistry, especially in the field of anionic activation [ 13-15 ] . Catalysts can be prepared in a wide range of basic strengths; therefore, depending on the basic strength required, the appropriate catalyst can be selected to catalyze the desired reaction more selectively. In this sense, the textural and chemical properties of active carbons, such as their porous structure, high degree of surface reactivity and extended surface area, mean that this type of material is a suitable catalyst for use in organic synthesis. Anionic alkylation of N-heterocycles, such as imidazole, is the primary route to obtain important intermediate pharmaceutical products such as acyclovir, ganciclovir, famciclovir and penciclovir [ 16,17 ] . Following the method recently proposed by Corma and Martin-Aranda [ 18 ] , which has been used successfully on several types of microporous base solid catalysts [ 19 ], in the present work we have used the condensation of benzaldehyde with malonic esters of different pKe values to measure the total amount of basic sites and basic strength distribution of alkaline carbons which have been used in the alkylation of imidazole to produce intermediates in the synthesis of anti-viral compounds of type A. ~J HZN N N OAc OAc Type A: famciclovir Materials Catalysts An activated carbon, RX-1 Extra Norit, has been used as carbon substrate. A series of alkaline carbons was prepared by ionic exchange using the corresponding Li, Na, K, and Cs carbonates over about 60 h at 353 K. In all cases the liquid to solid ratio was 10 by weight, and the metal content was 5%. Samples were filtered and washed to give carbonate-free material. After drying for 16 h at 383 K, the carbons were crushed and sieved to different particle sizes (0.074, 0.140 and 0.250 mm). Reactants Lithium, sodium, potassium and cesium carbonates, benzaldehyde, ethyl cyanoacetate, ethyl acetoacetate, diethyl malonate, ethyl bromoacetate, imida- R.M. Martin-Aranda et al. / J. Mol.

Equipment and methods Characterization Norit is a well characterized, steam-activated peat-char, which has a wide range of pores (V1=0.455 cm' g-1, VZ=0.108 cm' g-1 and V3=0.491 cm' g-1; '\" Vl -pore volume of O < 7.5 nm; VZ -pore volume of 7.5 < O < 50 nm and V3 =pore volume of O > 50 nm) [ 20 ] . Apparent surface areas of the carbon samples were calculated from N2 adsorption data at 77 K by the BET method (SNZ ). The molecular cross-sectional area of NZ used was 0.162 nm2, and the N2 adsorption isotherms were obtained using Micromeritics ASAP 2000 equipment (Table 1). The ash contents of samples studied were obtained by thermogravimetric analysis (Perkin-Elmer System 4). The calculated metal contents (Table 1) indicate that the exchange capacity of Norit is a maximum for the sodium, having similar values for lithium and potassium and the lowest capacity for cesium. Finally, the pH of the samples studied were measured following the method described by Rivera et al. [21 ] using an Omega pH-meter, model PHB-62. The pH results are also given in Table 1. All samples exhibit a basic pH from 8.59.5, which increases with the radius of the exchangeable cation. Reaction procedure Knoeaenagel condensation The reactions were carried out in a Pyrex glass reactor. Equimolar mixtures of the two reactants (benzaldehyde and the malonic ester) without any solvent were heated up to the reaction temperatures with stirring. Then, depending on the malonic ester employed, 1, 2 or 10 wt.-% of the carbon catalysts was added and the reaction time started. The reactions were followed by GC TABLE 1 Some characteristics of Norit alkaline carbons Carbon SHET (M2/g) pH Ash (%) M20 (%) Metal (at-g/100 g cat) Norit 1332 7.07 3.39 - - Li-Norit 974 8.43 3.49 0.10 0.007 Na-Norit 1215 9.28 3.61 0.22 0.007 K-Norit 1219 9.31 3.69 0.30 0.006 Cs-Norit 1220 9.43 3.92 0.53 0.004 256 R.M.

The condensation of benzaldehyde with the malonic esters was carried out on Li, Na, K and Cs exchanged samples and on a Norit sample which had not been subject to exchange (particle size within 0.074 and 0.140 mm) at three reaction temperatures (Tables 2-4). To calculate the kinetic rate constants of the catalysts, we have assumed the following mechanisms Step 1. The proton of the malonic ester is abstracted by the basic carbon forming a stabilized carbanion, Z-CHZ-COOEt+carbon-.Z-CH-COOEt+carbon H+ (1) Step 2.

Fig. 1 shows the results obtained at 413 K. From these results it can be stated that the order of activity is Li < Na < K < Cs, and the same order was observed at all the temperatures studied. Thua it can be concluded that the 260 R.M. Martin-Aranda et al. ,/ J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 253-264 activity increases with the radius of the cation; that is, the larger the cation size, the higher is the basicity of the catalyst. Effect of the pK. of the reactants The basic strength of these alkaline carbons has been studied using the condensation of benzaldehyde with four malonic esters of different pK. values; ethyl cyanoacetate, pKg=9; ethyl acetoacetate, pKa=10.7; diethyl malonate, pK. =13.3; and ethyl bromoacetate, pKe -16.5. These molecules have active methylenic groups with different acid strength and so their reactivities can be used to estimate the number and nature of basic sites present in the carbons. For these type of experiments, Cs-exchanged carbon has been selected as catalyst, and the reactions between benzaldehyde and the different malonic esters were carried out at 413 K. Fig. 2 displays the conversion values. Tables 5-7 show the calculated rate constant from the fitting of the experimental results to eqn. (5 ). From these results it can be stated that ethyl cyanoacetate is approximately five times more reactive than ethyl acetoacetate, and 500 times more active than diethyl malonate. The conversion obtained in the condensation of benzaldehyde with ethyl bromoacetate is very low. From these data it can be concluded that most of the active sites in alkaline carbon are able to abstract protons of 10.7 < pKg < 13.3, and there are also a few basic sites capable of abstracting protons of pK816.5.

The nature of the products depends upon the choice of the alkylating conditions and the catalyst employed. As we have seen, alkaline carbons are appropriate materials to catalyze basic organic reactions, showing, under our reactions conditions, basic sites up to pKa=16.5. Taking into account the fact that the NH group of imidazole presents a pKa -14.5 [ 23 ] , these carbons could be adequate catalysts to perform the alkylation. Alkylations of imidazole with 1-bromobutane and 2-bromobutane were carried out on Li, Na, K and Cs exchanged samples at 358 K (Scheme 1) and high conversions with practically 100% selectivity were obtained with these carbon catalysts (Figs. 3 and 4). The order of activity of the carbon samples was the same as that obtained previously: Li < Na < K < Cs. From these results it can be stated that 1-bromobutane presents a higher activity than 2-bromobutane, indicating that the nature of the alkyl halide affects the evolution of the reaction. Some members of the family of N-alkylated imidazoles have already passed through clinical trials and are now employed for therapeutic uses [24] and in this work we have developed a method for preparing intermediate products of N-alkylated imidazole using alkaline carbons.

Catal. 85 (1993) 253-264 the synthesis of N-alkylated heterocycles with antiviral properties and clinical applications. From the kinetic studies during the condensation of benzaldehyde with malonic esters as test reaction, it has been possible to deduce that Norit RX 1 Extra carbon exhibits an appreciable basicity, most of its basic sites lying in the range 9 < pK8 < 10.7. The introduction of alkaline cations by using the corresponding carbonates increases the activity of this type of materials. The basicity of the samples increases with the radius of the cation (Li < Na < K < Cs). In alkaline carbons, most of the active sites are able to abstract protons of 10.7 ,< pKe ,< 13.3, but basic sites capable of abstracting protons of 13.3 < pKg < 16.5 also exist. So, taking into account the fact that imidazole NH presents a pKg of 14.5, these basic carbons are appropriate catalysts for performing the alkylation of imidazole with alkyl halides.

Anionic alkylation of imidazole with alkyl halides to produce intermediates in the synthesis of pharmaceutically important antiviral products, such as famciclovir and acyclovir, have been carried out using alkaline carbons as base catalysts. Previously to the alkylation of imidazole, the condensation of benzaldehyde with malonic esters has been used as test reaction of basicity on a series of lithium, sodium, potassium and cesium exchanged Norit RX 1 Extra activated carbon. The importance of active sites and the measurement of surface basicity have been emphasized. Under reaction conditions, it has been found that most of the basic sites in alkaline carbons have 10.7⩽pK a⩽13.3, but there is a considerable number of sites able to abstract protons of 13.3 ⩽pK a⩽16.5. Norit RX 1 Extra which was not subject to alkaline exchange retains most of its basic sites capable of abstracting protons of 9 ⩽pK a⩽10.7. Taking into account that the pK a. of the NH group of imidazole is 14.5, the alkaline carbons present the required basic strength to catalyze the alkylation of this N-heterocycle with alkyl halides.
