Especially, capacitive Deionization (CDI) is promising as a future technology for water treatment. Graphene (rGO) has been intensively studied for CDI electrode because of its advantages such as excellent electrical conductivity and high specific surface area. However, its 2D dimensional structure with small specific capacitance, high resistance between layers and hydrophobicity degrades ion adsorption efficiency. In this work, we successfully prepared uniformly dispersed Fe3O4/rGO nanocomposite by simple thermal reactions and applied it as effective electrodes for CDI. Iron oxides play a role in uniting graphene sheets, and specific capacitance and wettability of electrodes are improved significantly; hence CDI performances are enhanced. The hardness removal of Fe3O4/rGO nanocomposite electrodes can reach 4.3mg/g at applied voltage of 1.5V, which is 3 times higher than that of separate rGO electrodes. Thus this material is a promising candidate for water softening technology.

Metallic cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe3+ and Mn2+, etc.) causing water hardness in tap, ground, and river water can be treated by popular methods such as chemical precipitation, ion exchange process, nanofilteration, reverse osmosis, and electro-membrane systems [1]. However, these processes still bear shortcomings such as the addition of chemicals into water, especially, high energy consumption and operation cost [2–4]. Therefore, it is necessary to find an effective method to overcome these problems [5,6]. Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a novel technology developed for the removal of charged ionic species from salty water, such as salt ions [7]. The basic concept of CDI is to force charged ions toward oppositely polarized electrodes by imposing a direct electric field to form a strong electrical double layer and hold the ions. Once the electric field disappears, the ions are instantly released back to the bulk solution. In a configuration of CDI cells, the feed stream flows between each pair of high capacity electrodes, i.e., porous carbon electrodes. By polarizing both electrodes, the charged ions are adsorbed on each electrode surface; positively charged ions are attracted on a surface of the negatively charged electrode and vice versa [8]. CDI is an alternative low-energy consumption desalination technology. Although numerous researches have been reported applying CDI technique to desalination [9], heavy metal [4] and biomass removal [10], few studies have focused on applying CDI to water softening. Therefore, the investigation of water softening performance using CDI process is needed. As typical porous electrode materials of CDI cell, carbon based materials including activated carbon [11,12], carbon aerogels [13], and carbon nanotubes [14,15] are always attractive with researchers to be employed as electrosorptive electrodes due to their good conductivity, high surface area, and suitable pore size distribution. Graphene (rGO), a two-dimensional sp 2 bonded carbon material, has attracted considerable attention over the past few years due to its amazing electrical, thermal, and electrochemical properties arising from its unique structure [4]. With large theoretical surface area and excellent conductivity [16,17], graphene is a remarkable candidate for application in energy storage device as well as CDI. Even though graphene exhibits good electrochemical performance in terms of energy storage, its hydrophobic property and small specific capacitance could lower the wettability and electrolyte accessibility, resulting in the decrease in ion transfer rates in CDI process. So far, to improve and develop the potential electrochemical properties of graphene, several methods were proposed such as: mixing graphene with other materials [18,19], modifying graphene fabrication [20,21], and compositing with transition metal oxides (MnO2 [22], NiO [23], SnO2 [24], Co3O4 [25]) for batteries, super-capacitors, and fuel cell. Yet limited studies have mentioned the idea of applying them to CDI. Recently, only MnO2, TiO2, Fe3O4, and SnO2/rGO compositions were studied as electrodes for desalination purpose. Ahmed G. El-Deen prepared nanostructured-MnO2@graphene sandwich [26] with controlled morphology. The prepared electrode showed the CDI performance improvement of 26% comparing to pristine graphene electrode. In his other research [27], TiO2 nanoparticles were loaded into graphene by hydrothermal treatment method. This unique morphological structure exhibited impressive features, high wettability, prevented the release of TiO2 and hence improved ion adsorption. Gu et al. [28] fabricated mesoporous graphene electrode using etching method of Fe3O4 nanoparticle on rGO in acidic media. The prepared rGO/Fe3O4 electrode showed electrosorptive capacity which is 1.5 times higher than that of pristine rGO. In this work, we prepare uniformly-dispersed Fe3O4/rGO nanocomposites by simple thermal reactions. The main focuses are to improve hydrophilicity and specific capacitance of electrodes. It is explained that the Fe3O4 composited on rGO forms anchors to increase interfacial contact surface and decrease ion mass transfer resistance in electrodes and between electrodes and electrolytes. This introduced material with cost effectiveness is expected to significantly enhance ion adsorption ability of CDI system. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials All chemicals including commercial graphite powder, potassium permanganate, phosphoric acid (85%), sulphuric acid (95%–97%), hydrogen peroxide (30%), hydrochloric acid (37%) and iron (III) chloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without any further purification. 2.2 Graphite oxide preparation Graphite oxide was fabricated by modified traditional Hummer method. Three grams of graphite powder were put into a concentrated sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid with ratio 9:1 in volume. This solution was placed into a cooling bath, added with 18g KMnO4 and kept at 80°C for 24h. Then, after being diluted with DI water, 40mL of 30% H2O2 and 30mL of 10% HCl were added and the solution was stirred slowly to remove the residual KMnO4 and metal ions. The mixture was washed by centrifuge and dialysis processes until a pH of 7 and conductivity of less than 20µS/cm were reached. Finally, the solution was washed again and dried to remove humidity. 2.3 Graphene preparation Dried graphene oxide was added into DI water to re-disperse, the ratio of GO and DI water is 1g per 200mL. Then the solution was sonicated to obtain a homogeneous dispersion. 98% hydrazine solution was added into GO solution (the ratio being 0.1mL hydrazine per 100mL GO) and kept at 80°C for 1h. During the reduction process, the color of dispersed GO solution turned from dark brown to black. Subsequently, this solution was washed with DI water until a pH of 7 was reached and dried to totally remove humidity. 2.4 Fe3O4/rGO nanocomposite preparation In a typical procedure, Fe3O4/rGO composites were prepared by a simple thermal hydrolysis process. The amount of FeCl3•6H2O powder was varied (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5g) in order to control the ratio of Fe3O4 and rGO. The amounts of rGO and KOH were fixed at 1 and 3.75g, respectively. FeCl3•6H2O and rGO powder were mixed and sonicated in alkaline condition (KOH) until a homogeneous solution was obtained. Fe(OH)3 will be formed by the following reaction: (1) rGO+3KOH+FeCl3 =rGO+Fe(OH)3 +3KCl The products of this reaction were heated at 850°C for 1h in nitrogen condition. At high temperature and lack of oxygen, a small amount of rGO was partly reduced and CO was formed. Then CO and Fe(OH)3 reacted to form Fe3O4, CO2, and H2O vapor. (2) 6Fe(OH)3 +CO=2Fe3O4 +CO2 +9H2O Formed Fe3O4/rGO samples were washed by 10% HCl and DI water until pH =7, and then dried in an oven to remove humidity. The samples notated as FG-0.125, FG-0.25, and FG-0.5, in accordance with the amounts of FeCl3•H2O mentioned above, were compared to separate rGO to investigate water softening efficiency. 2.5 Electrode preparation for CDI test Fe3O4/rGO nanocomposites and PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) as binder (ratio 9:1) were used to fabricate the electrode. Each graphite sheet electrode was 100mm wide×100mm long×0.21mm thick. To achieve secured adhesion between the carbon mixture and graphite layer, the raw mixture of powders (Fe3O4/rGO and PVDF powder) and N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent was sonicated and mixed by a ball milling machine for about 24h then coated on graphite sheet by doctor blade equipment. The ball milling method was used instead of simple stirring process to finely grind Fe3O4/rGO powder more smoothly and helped the mixture, binder as well as solvent gain more homogeneous slurry. The rotational speed was set at 300rpm in 10min and repetition was approximately 35 times. The mixture was checked for sticky state every 5 times of repetition. The electrodes were dried in oven at 60°C for 12h to remove entirely humidity, and then put into a vacuum furnace at 70°C for 24h to evaporate residual organic materials. Finally, the electrodes were assembled into a CDI device for testing. Hardness water solution was pumped into the CDI system, where the voltage had been applied. The dilute solution flowing from CDI cell was measured every 10s by a conductivity meter. Regeneration process was conducted simply by turning off the power supply. Ions adsorbed on the electrode surface were desorbed back into the stream flow. 2.6 Experimental analysis The artificial feed solution was prepared by dissolving 28.8mg/L of CaCl2, 22.0mg/L of MgSO4•7H2O, and 39.0mg/L of NaHCO3 in DI water. The feed solution was used for all the experiments in this research and its total hardness and conductivity were 35ppm (as CaCO3) and about 110µS/cm, respectively. Surface analysis of rGO and Fe3O4/rGO were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In order to measure the hydrophilicity of each electrode depending on the feed solution and DI water, the sessile drop method of a standard goniometer with drop image was used. For a determination of the contact angle, the captured images were analyzed using drop image standard software. The Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) surface area and pore size distribution (PSD) were examined using nitrogen as adsorbate at 77K. Electrochemical performances of as-obtained electrodes were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at room temperature. The electrical conductivity of electrodes was measured using the four-point probe method. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 rGO and Fe3O4/rGO characterization The morphology and crystal structure images of the rGO and Fe3O4/ rGO composite surfaces are displayed in Fig. 1. It is clearly observed from SEM that graphene surface changes with the uniform presence of small particles. The numerous layers similar to smooth wave veils are observed on pristine graphene surfaces. After the preparation of Fe3O4/rGO, these layers become rougher and are attached by iron oxide nanoparticles. Valuably, the iron oxide-graphene bond is sufficiently strong due to the negative charge and rough surface of graphene sheets combined with the positive charge of iron oxide, which prevents stacking and enlarges the space between graphene sheets effectively. Thus, it induces the electrode to be more stable with electrochemical reaction and CDI process. Besides, the difference among the surface structure of each Fe3O4/rGO composite is affected considerably by the mass ratio of Fe3O4 and rGO. From FG-0.125 to FG-0.5 images, the amounts of Fe3O4 nanoparticles decorated on the rGO sheets surfaces increase in accordance with the increase in amount of FeCl3 powders in thermal hydrolysis reactions. The intercalation of these nanoscale particles between graphene sheets is expected to enhance the electrical conductivity of electrodes and significantly improve salt ion adsorption in CDI process. Fig. 1 also displays the TEM images of the pristine rGO and Fe3O4/rGO composites. As shown, Fe3O4 nanoparticles are observed on all samples with mean size of 25, 8, and 20nm for FG-0.125, FG-0.25, and FG-0.5, respectively. It is easily seen that Fe3O4 particles are homogeneously and uniformly distributed on the surface of the rGO surface. The particle size changes according to the different ratios of Fe3O4 and rGO. Apparently, the loading density of iron oxide particles increases from FG-0.125 to FG-0.5 and it is in good agreement with the results from SEM images. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles act as anchors on the surface of rGO sheets preventing the agglomeration of rGO sheets, hence increasing their electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity. To investigate the component changes in samples, EDX element analysis is applied. As shown in Table 1, the main elements of rGO are C and O, which confirm the entire reduction of GO by hydrazine. Besides, the existence of Fe element in FG-0.125, FG-0.25, and FG-0.5 also demonstrates the successful process of attaching iron oxide on graphene sheets. The Fe3O4 weight increase (0%, 25%, 40%, and 43%) is directly proportional to the increase of FeCl3•6H2O/rGO ratio in the fabrication step of Fe3O4/rGO composite (presented at Section 2.4). The XRD patterns of the precipitates formed on rGO surface through hydrolysis reaction processes are shown in Fig. 2. The broad diffraction peaks around 24.5o and 43.0o are assigned to the diffraction of graphene, indicating that GO sheets have been reduced into rGO after reduction reaction. The diffraction peaks around 30.1o (220), 35.5o (311), 43.2o (400), 53.3o (420), 57.2o (511) and 62.6o (440) are assigned to the diffraction of Fe3O4 (JCPDS No. 75-0033). Higher peak intensities are always associated with the larger amounts of FeCl3 added into rGO. No obvious other peak is found in these XRD images suggesting the ultra-purity of the as-prepared products and the experiment's success. To investigate the difference in specific surface area and pore size distribution of the new materials, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurement is conducted. As shown in Fig. 3, the specific surface areas of rGO, FG-0.125, FG-0.25 and FG-0.5 are 182.8, 208.4, 275.8 and 63.6m2/g, respectively. Obviously, the formation and interaction of Fe3O4 on rGO sheets at high temperature increase the specific surface area of materials with specific iron oxide/graphene ratio (FG-0.125 and FG-0.25). It can be explained by the increase of pore formation around the metal oxide particles. The enhancement of surface area also is found in other studies when compositing TiO2 on rGO [27] or FeNi on carbon nanofiber [29]. The larger surface area of FG-0.25 will shorten the ion diffusion paths and enhance the utilization of active materials, which improves significantly ion adsorption capacity in CDI. However, the Fe3O4/rGO ratio should be controlled to maintain a higher surface area for the electrode. Higher amount of Fe3O4 in the composite (FG-0.5) results in lower surface area. This originates from the small specific surface area of the separate iron oxide. The pore size distribution analysis based on the desorption branch (Fig. 3) shows that all samples have mesoporous surface structure suitable for CDI performance. To examine the wettability of each electrode, contact angle measurements are performed using DI water. As shown in Fig. 4, the presence of Fe3O4 particles considerably improves the hydrophilicity of material. The contact angles of rGO, FG-0.125, FG-0.25, and FG-0.5 are 51.7o, 49.5o, 26.1o, and 34.8o, respectively. Clearly, contact angle gradually decreases when increasing Fe3O4/rGO ratio from 0:4 (pristine rGO) and 0.5:4 (FG-0.125) to 1:4 (FG-0.25). When the ratio of Fe3O4/rGO increases to 2:4 (FG-0.5), contact angle slightly recovers from 26.1o to 34.8o. It is understood that increasing the thickness of the Fe3O4 layer reduces the permeability of water on the electrode. The three-electrode system at ambient temperature is used to measure electrochemical properties of materials. The prepared electrodes, platinum plates, and saturated calomel electrodes are used as the working electrode, the counter electrode, and the reference electrode, respectively. The potential sweep cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements are carried out in 0.1mol/L KOH solutions at a various scan rates from 10, 50, and 100mV/s. The specific capacitance is proportional to the average areas of CV curves and higher capacitance means that more electrolyte ions are able to reach the pores of the electrode. As clearly seen from Fig. 5(a–c), the CV curve of rGO is substantially narrower than that of Fe3O4/rGO composites, which indicates smaller specific capacitances. When Fe3O4/rGO ratio increases from 0.5:4 (FG-0.125) to 1:4 (FG-0.25), specific capacitance is enhanced due to the positively interaction and support between iron oxide and graphene. However, the numerous amounts of Fe3O4 on rGO sheets (FG-0.5) suppress electrochemical activity of the electrode due to the poor specific capacitance of separate Fe3O4 and small surface area of FG-0.5 material. The specific capacitance is known to be a powerful indicator to evaluate the CDI performance. On the basis of the above CV results, FG-0.25 shows the best capacitance at each scan rate; hence it is expected to have the most efficiency CDI performance. Besides, the CV curves of the three iron oxide and graphene composites show a pair of peaks at –0.99V and –0.56V, which is due to Faradic process contributed from Fe3O4 redox reaction (Fe(II) and Fe(III)). This is the result of the combination of both electric double-layer capacitances from rGO and Faradic pseudo-capacitive behavior from Fe3O4. The peak intensity is directly proportional to the amounts of iron oxide embedded in graphene sheets. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis is effectively used to determine the electric conductivity of the electrode materials [26]. Fig. 5(d) shows the Nyquist images of the electrodes. Clearly, all rGO/Fe3O4 composite electrodes have semicircle smaller than pristine rGO with lower intercept at high frequency region (frequency above 10kHz) that reflects lower resistances of electrode/electrolyte interface. For example, the resistance of rGO in the high frequency of 0.86MHz is 3.22 Ω; whereas corresponding resistance data of FG-0.125, FG-0.25, and FG-0.5 are 2.68, 2.46, and 2.96 Ω, respectively. At both very high (frequency above 10kHz) and low frequency (frequency below 0.3kHz), FG-0.25 has the lowest semicircle as seen from EIS curve; this confirms a low ionic resistance between electrode and electrolyte. For example, the resistance of FG-0.25 in low frequency of 3.55Hz is 12.02 Ω, compared to corresponding resistance data of rGO, FG-0.125, and FG-0.5 are 16.62, 20.61, and 13.95 Ω, respectively. Thus, FG-0.25 is expected to exhibit the best electrical conductivity and capacitive behavior for CDI units. The effects of embedded iron oxide on conductivity are studied using four-point probe method. As shown in Fig. 5(e), pristine rGO has strikingly high resistivity of 26.5kΩ/sq (15 times higher than that of FG-0.125). However, the positive effect for the improvement of conductivity is observed after including the iron oxide among rGO layers and the highest electrical conductivity is detected in FG-0.25. The enhancement might result from original high electrical conductivity of iron oxide and the anchor formation of iron oxide nanoparticles uniting graphene sheets. The slightly higher resistance of FG-0.5 compared with FG-0.25 can be explained by lower wettability which negatively affects to conductivity of electrode (as seen from Fig. 4 with contact angle image). 3.2 CDI unit cell performance The electrosorption capacity (mg/g) is defined as the adsorbed ion amounts per gram of the electrode and can be examined by the concentration or conductivity variation of solutions during the charging process. The CDI unit cell performance is conducted to evaluate the ion removal ability of the electrode. The conductivity of feed solution is about 110µS/cm. As shown in Fig. 6, rGO displays low ion electrosorption at every applied voltage. Since Fe3O4 nano particle is composited on rGO, the CDI performance of the new material is significantly improved. At 1.5V, CDI efficiency increases from 22% (rGO) to 34% with FG-0.125, 43% with FG-0.5 and 48% with FG-0.25. At lower applied voltages (1.0V and 1.2V), rGO indicates slow kinetic of ion adsorption process: adsorption time are up to 60min at 1.0V and 120min at 1.2V. After loading rGO with iron oxide, adsorption times are considerably reduced to below 30min at 1.0V and 50min at 1.2V. Undoubtedly, the presence of Fe3O4 improves significantly the CDI efficiency and shorten rapidly ion adsorption period. Based on the adsorption/desorption curves in Fig. 6, FG-0.25 shows the best CDI performance with every applied voltage; this result absolutely agrees with its other great properties presented in this work. The maximum ion removal efficiency of FG-0.25 at 1.5V is 4.3mg/g; three times higher than that of rGO (1.3mg/g). This result is higher than Gu's report [28] in which the CDI efficiency using iron oxide etching on graphene is 1.5 times higher than that of pristine graphene. Clearly, Fe3O4/rGO composite appears to be an ideal material capable of replacing rGO in water softening technology. Cyclic test is performed to evaluate the stability of FG-0.25 electrode in CDI unit. This factor plays a decisive role with respect to the practical feasibility of this material. In this case, the concentration of feed solution is increased to 180ppm (conductivity of 540µS/cm) which is similar to the hard water feature in natural condition. Each 5min of adsorption followed by 40min of desorption is implemented at 1.5V with a flow rate of 10mL/min (Fig. 7a). The experiment is repeated 20 times in continuous operation mode for a total time of over 20h (Fig. 7b). As shown in Fig. 7(a), the adsorption process occurs rapidly in the first 5min in which conductivity decreases promptly from 540µS/cm to 170µS/cm. Whereas, desorption prolongs until 40min because FG-0.25 has meso-porous structure with the complicated combination of mirco- and meso-pores affecting the removal pathway of ions. The CDI efficiency can reach 68.4% with a total ion removal of 3.7mg/g. As expected in Fig. 7(b), a significant degradation of CDI performance is not observed during 20 cycles. At the 20th cycle, the water softening efficiency remains at 60%, just only 8.4% lower than that of the first cycle. Clearly, this result shows excellent stability of the material in CDI process. 4 Conclusions In this report, we successfully fabricated Fe3O4/rGO nanocomposites to enhance CDI performance. This method improves the hydrophilicity, ion transfer resistance, surface area, and specific capacitance of electrodes. Fe3O4/rGO composite was firstly used as electrodes for CDI cell with attractive features, such as high performance and faster ion electrosorption. The maximum ion removal achieved with FG-0.25 electrode at 1.5V is 4.3mg/g; three times higher than the corresponding value of rGO. In addition, the material shows remarkable stability in cyclic test with over 20h of continuous operation. In summary, the new fabricated material exhibits an excellent potential as a promising electrode for CDI application in water softening technology.

Especially, capacitive Deionization (CDI) is promising as a future technology for water treatment. Graphene (rGO) has been intensively studied for CDI electrode because of its advantages such as excellent electrical conductivity and high specific surface area. However, its 2D dimensional structure with small specific capacitance, high resistance between layers and hydrophobicity degrades ion adsorption efficiency. In this work, we successfully prepared uniformly dispersed Fe3O4/rGO nanocomposite by simple thermal reactions and applied it as effective electrodes for CDI. Iron oxides play a role in uniting graphene sheets, and specific capacitance and wettability of electrodes are improved significantly; hence CDI performances are enhanced. The hardness removal of Fe3O4/rGO nanocomposite electrodes can reach 4.3mg/g at applied voltage of 1.5V, which is 3 times higher than that of separate rGO electrodes. Thus this material is a promising candidate for water softening technology.",
