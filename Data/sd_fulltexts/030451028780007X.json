69 65 Letter (l75 C5H5)NlRu3(^l-H)3(CO)9 as a Heterogeneous Catalyst Precursor: Hydrogenation, Dealkylation and Cracking Reactions of Cyclic Dienes and Aromatic Hydrocarbons MARIO CASTIGLIONI, ROBERTO GIORDANO and ENRICO SAPPA* Istituto di Chimica Generate ed Inorganica, Umversita di Torino, Corso Massimo d'Azeglw 48, 10125 Turin (Italy) (Received June 23, 1986, accepted October 13, 1986) Metal carbonyl clusters have met with limited success in homogeneous catalysis because of their low stability in the severe reaction conditions sometimes required for processes such as hydroformylation and syn-gas reactions Attempts to heterogenize clusters by impregnation or anchoring on supports have been performed with the goal of improving technological aspects of the catalytic processes, e g the separation of the catalyst from the products However, in many examples, partial or total decarbonylation occurs under catalytic conditions, to give sub-carbonyl species or cluster- derived metal particles (CDMPs) [1,2] The latter frequently behave as heterogeneous catalysts showing remarkable activities and selectivities, indeed, the carbonyl clusters offer two major advantages as catalyst precursors, with respect to the metallic salts (i) no reduction steps are required and (n) the extremely small metal particles formed display activities and selectivities different from those associated with larger crystallites Moreover, a high degree of dispersion is generally obtained, the heterometallic clusters may give particles of uniform stoichiometry, not easily obtainable by conventional methods [3] Finally, different metals are expected to exert synergistic effects [4-6] We wish to report here on the reactivity in hydrogenation, dealkylation and cracking of cyclic dienes and aromatic hydrocarbons displayed by a heterogeneous catalyst obtained from the heterometallic cluster (T75-C5H5)- NiRu3(jU-H)3(CO)9 (1) [7,8] supported and thermally treated on Chromosorb Complex 1 is active in the homogeneous hydrogenation of linear and cyclic dienes [9], its osmium homologue (complex 2) [8] was previously studied as a catalyst both in homogeneous conditions [10] and when supported on A^O^ [11,12] or on gas-chromatographic materials [13, 14] The structure of complex 1 has been hypothesized on the basis of spectroscopic results and by analogy with the known structure of 2 It is shown in Fig 1. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed 0304-5102/87/$3 50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 66 0. 0 NI C' '^y^o / ^fr^o 0- \\ b Fig 1 Hypothesized structure of complex 1 (based on spectroscopic results and on analogy with the known structure of 2) Complex 1, obtained by estabhshed procedures [9, 15], was used to prepare a catalytic column analogous to that described in the case of complex 2, to be operated in a gas-chromatographic catalytic-analytic system developed in our laboratory and previously described [13,14]. The column was prepared by dissolving in hght pretroleum 35 mg of 1 and adding to the solution 12 g of silanized Chromosorb P (Johns-Manville), drying under reduced pressure and then treating the solid material, packed into the column, in a current ofdihydrogen (25 ml mm\"1) for 7 h at 230 C. The substrates examined were commercial products (Fluka, Aldnch, Carlo Erba) and were used as received, after GLC purity tests; all were injected as vapours The liquid products were introduced into glass gas containers equipped with a rubber septum, accurately evacuated and freed from moisture, variable amounts of the saturated vapour phases (in equilibrium with the liquid) were transferred with gas syringes, while accurately checking the temperature*. The reaction products were analyzed as follows, cyclic monoenes and dienes, n-octane/Porasy! C (100/120 mesh) column**, 60 C for 6 mm, then 3 C mm\"1 up to 135 C, Ha 25 ml mm\"1!. Aromatic hydrocarbons, Bentonite 34/1,1-didecylphthalate column, 65 C for 6 mm, then 5 C mm\"1 up to 130 C, H2 25 ml mm\"1. The results obtained are shown in Table 1, where a comparison with the behaviour of cluster 2 towards some substrates is also made The hetero- geneous system containing CDMPs derived from lit shows considerable activity, at only 80 C, cyclohexene, 1,3- and 1,4-cyclohexadiene are completely hydrogenated to cyclohexane The catalyst formed by 1 is also considerably more active in the hydro- genation of benzene, when compared to those formed by 2 on different supports; indeed, benzene is completely hydrogenated in the temperature *0 1 ml (benzene and toluene) and 0 2 ml (xylene and mesitylene) of vapour were injected at 25 C, these represented about lO\"7 mol substrate on 2 X 10~4 g-atoms of metal (N1 + Ru) **Always 2 m X 0 6 mm i d +The hydrogen was used as both reactant and carrier gas t+Extraction of the column material after treatment under dihydrogen at 230 C for 7 h showed the absence of any soluble material 67 TABLE 1 Reactions of cyclic dienes and aromatic hydrocarbons on heterogeneous catalysts derived from clusters 1 and 2 Substrate Reaction Composition of the effluent gases (%) /opx cracking n-hexane cycio- methyl- productsa hexane c-hexane unreacted substrate cyclohexene cluster 1 1.3-cyclohexadiene cluster 1 1.4-cyclohexadiene cluster 1 benzene cluster 1 cluster 2^ cluster 2\" toluene cluster 1 cluster 2\" 80 80 80 80 150 230 102 150 200 80 150 230 200 1000 1000 1000 - 83 91 7 20 97 883 81 9 57 124 1000 - 08 981 100 - 900 26 974 - tr 39 49 91 2 - 90 8 tr tr 92 - 10 990 cracking t-1,4- c-1,4- heavier unreacted products dimethyl- dimethyl- products substrate cycio- cyclo- hexane hexane p-xylene cluster 1 mesitylene cluster 1 150 190 230 230 1 2 40 1 58 7 - 27 1 44 5 28 0 85 4 10 0 4 6 77 5 221 tr tr tr cracking n-hexane cycio- methyl- ethyl-c- unreacted products hexane c-hexane hexane substrate phenylacetylene cluster 1 130 0 9 2 5 04 5 1 85 8 53 180 14 7 4 7 3 1 31 3 43 6 26 230 83 2 9 1 1 1 4 7 tr 1 8 'Ci + Ci products, not separable in the conditions of analysis adopted b Activated at 180 C for 7 h on Al^, see [7] \"See [8] range 80-150 C, giving mainly cyclohexane and some n-hexane. By contrast, in the presence of 2 supported on A^Oa [11,12] only cyclohexane was formed, at temperatures above 100 C, finally, the catalytic column 68 containing 2 supported on Chromosorb [13, 14] hydrogenated to cyclo- hexane only 10% of the benzene injected at 200 C. In the temperature range 80-150 C, toluene is hydrogenated mainly to methylcyclohexane; at 200 C, in the same conditions, complex 2 gave only 1% of this product [14] An interesting demethylation to cyclohexane is also observed The intermediation of methylcyclohexane in the demethyl- ation process has been established, in the same reaction conditions, methylcyclohexane is demethylated to cyclohexane, and ring opening of this latter also occurs to give small amounts of n-hexane. At 230 C, as observed for benzene, the cracking to Ci and Cz products becomes the main process The behaviour of p-xylene and mesitylene was also examined, the former, at 150 -190 C, gives mainly products tentatively identified as trans- and cis-l,4-dimethylcyclohexane The latter also gives some isomenc dimethylcyclohexanes and heavier products, probably tnmethylcyclo- hexanes* The observed dealkylating ability of the system is confirmed by the behaviour of phenylacetylene, which gives mainly ethyl- and methylcyclo- hexane, but also smaller amounts of cyclohexane and n-hexane. By contrast, ethylbenzene, in the presence of CDMPs derived from Ru3(CO) 12 supported on silica, gives mainly toluene and methane [16] It is very rare, indeed, to observe the cleavage of a C C bond in which a carbon atom is part of a phenyl ring and, in general, unless strained rings are present [17-19], unactivated C C single bonds seldom are broken by catalytic hydrogenation. Methyl and ethyl groups have been cleaved from polyalkyladamantanes by hydrogenation at atmospheric pressure at about 250 C with a Ni-A^O^ catalyst [20], a 'structure-sensitive' test reaction for the activity of Co^Rhy (CO)i2/Si02 consisted in the selective conversion of methylcyclopentane to non-cyclic Cg molecules This reaction was accompanied by very little ring expansion to higher cyclic molecules and cracking, it was performed, however, at 260 C after activation of the catalyst at 380 C [2], that is, in conditions considerably more drastic than those adopted in this work Hence, in our opinion, the catalyst here reported provides an easy method for the hydrogenation of aromatic rings and, at the same time, their indirect dealkylation to unsubstituted cyclic saturated hydrocarbons through the intermediate formation of methylated cycloalkanes. Further studies are in progress, aimed at establishing the effect of the metal stoichiometry [12] and of the support [21] on the hydrogenation reactions of linear and cyclic dienes and of aromatic hydrocarbons. \"These were tentatively identified on the basis of their boiling points and retention volumes Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometnc analyses confirmed the identifications Further experiments on authentic samples are in progress 69 Acknowledgements Financial support for this work was obtained from the Ministero della Pubblica Istruzione, and from C N.R (Rome) Johnson Matthey is acknowledged for a loan of ruthenium tnchlonde References 1 J Zwart and R Snel, 3 Mol Catal, 30 (1985) 305 2 R Whyman, in B P G Johnson (ed ), Transition Metal Clusters, Wiley, New York, 1980,p 545 3 J M Basset and R Ugo, in R Ugo (ed ), Aspects of Homogeneous Catalysis, Vol 3, Reidel, Dordrecht, 1977, p 137 4 C Ungermann, V Landis, S A Moya, H Cohen, H Walker, R G.
