Graphical abstract Main-chain diphosphine-Pd Polymer was synthesized and used as an efficient heterogeneous palladium catalyst for Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction. Two diphosphines 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)benzene (M1) and 4,4′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1′-biphenyl (M2) were synthesized by employing Grignard reaction. They were subsequently employed to coordinate with palladium chloride to construct main-chain diphosphine-Pd organometallic polymers P1 and P2, respectively. Both polymers were used as self-supported heterogeneous catalysts for Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions of various aryl halides and arylboronic acids at room temperature. A higher catalytic activity for P1 and P2 than their homogeneous counterpart were observed, and the activity of P2 is slightly higher than that of P1. Moreover, polymer P2 can be readily recovered and reused for further transformations at least six times without decrease in catalytic activity, while an obvious decline of activity for P1 was observed after the fourth run. Keywords Phosphine Palladium Coordination Organometallic polymer Suzuki-Miyaura coupling 1 Introduction Palladium catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction of aryl halides with arylboronic acids are among the most useful synthetic transformations to construct fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals [1]. In general, the coupling reaction can efficiently proceed in the presence of homogeneous palladium complexes. Despite significant progress for Suzuki-Miyaura reaction has been achieved in recent years [2–4], there are some drawbacks of homogeneous palladium catalysis including the difficulty in recovery and reuse of the usually expensive catalysts, as well as product contamination by incomplete separation of metal catalysts [5]. The typical way to solve these problems is anchoring palladium catalysts on suitable support [6–8], such as carbon [9–11], polymers [12–14], silica [15–17], magnetic particals [18–20], biomaterials [21–23], dendrimers [24–26] and porous polymers [27–29]. However, some of these heterogeneos palladium catalysts show lower catalytic activity in comparison with the homogeneous counterparts. Progress for heterogeneous palladium catalysts with enhanced activity are still highly desirable. In the field of heterogeneous metal catalysis, a self-supporting strategy for catalyst immobilization has been developed based on coordination bonds between active metal centers and organic ligands [30]. The resulting organometallic polymers usually have high stability against hydrolysis and thermal decomposition. The metal-ligand units are equally distributed in the polymer backbone which promote easy access of substrates to catalytic sites, leading to enhanced mass transfer and good reaction efficiency. Due to the metal and ligand diversity, catalytic property of the organometallic polymer could be finely tuned to meet specific requirement. Therefore, a variety of these organic-inorganic hybrid materials have been facilely obtained and successfully used as heterogeneous catalysts [31–37]. Phosphines are a class of versatile ligands owing to their strong σ-donating ability and easy preparation. It’s not surprising that they have been widely employed as functional groups in heterogeneous transition metal catalysis [38–41]. Recently, Sijbesma et al. reported a new kind of main-chain phosphine-based organometallic polymers which were prepared through reaction of diphosphine compounds with Pd(II), Pt(II) salts [42–44]. The good solublility which results from long alkyl chain in the diphosphine unit, as well as the potential reversible coordination of phosphines make these polymers cannot be directly used in heterogeneous metal catalysis. However, this type of self-assemblies have the typical features of organometallic polymers. If properly designed, the diphosphine-metal polymer should have the ability to act as efficient heterogeneous catalyst. In this study, two diphosphines M1 and M2 were synthesized and subsequently used as palladium ligands to construct organometallic polymers. These two polymers were employed as heterogeneous palladium catalyst for the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of a variety of aryl halides and arylboronic acids. Their catalytic efficiency and recyclability were presented. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to report the study of heterogeneous catalysis with diphosphine-Pd polymer. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and methods 1,4-Dibromobenzene, 4,4′-dibromo-1,1′-biphenyl, chlorodiphenylphosphine and iodine were purchased from Adamas. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was refluxed with sodium prior to use. Magnesium turnings was pretreated in dilute hydrochloric acid. NMR spectra were recorded on Varian Unity Inova 600 spectrometer (1H at 600MHz, 13C at 150MHzand 31P at 240MHz). Solid-state 13C and 31P cross-polarization magic-angle spinning (CP/MAS) NMR spectroscopy were recorded on Varian Infinity-plus 300 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out in a N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 20°C/min on a Diamond TG/DTA thermal analyzer (Perkin Elmer). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were conducted on a JEOL JSM-6510 electron microscope. ICP-AES analysis was performed on a Perkin Elmer Optima 8000 instrument. Elemental analyses (EA) was performed on a Vario Micro cube Elemental Analyzer (Elementar, Germany). 2.2 Synthesis (a) Synthesis of diphosphines. M1 was synthesized by modified procedure of previous report [45]. A three-necked flask charged with Mg turnings (2.88g, 120mmol) and a grain of I2 (about 35mg) was degassed and purged with N2, and then 60mL of THF was added. After slowly adding a solution of 1,4-dibromobenzene (4.68g, 20mmol) in THF (30mL), the reaction mixture was stirred at 60°C for 10h. Next, Ph2PCl (8.80g, 40mmol) was slowly added to the resulting solution at room temperature followed by stirring at the same temperature for 8h. The reaction was quenched with aqueous NH4Cl solution and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water, dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum) to obtain 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphanyl)benzene. Yield: 6.19g, white powder, 69%; M.p. 166–167°C; 1H NMR (600MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ =7.22–7.24 (m, 4H), 7.31–7.33 (m, 20H)；13C NMR (150MHz,CDCl3,ppm): δ =128.5, 128.8, 133.3, 133.8, 136.7, 137.9; 31P NMR (240MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ =−6.6. M2 was synthesized under the same conditions except that the dibromo compound used was 4,4′-dibromo-1,1′-biphenyl instead of 1,4-dibromobenzene. Yield: 6.41g, white powder, 61%; M.p. 193–194°C; 1H NMR (600MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ =7.34-7.38 (m, 24H), 7.55–7.57 (m, 4H)；13C NMR (150MHz,CDCl3,ppm): δ =127.3, 128.8, 129.0, 134.0, 134.4, 136.7 137.2, 140.9; 31P NMR (240MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ =−7.0. (b) Synthesis of diphosphine-Pd polymers. Both polymers were prepared by modified procedure for the synthesis of bis(triphenylphosphi​ne)​palladium chloride [46]. Palladium chloride (0.45g, 2.5mmol) was dissolved in 4mL of acidified ethanol (concentrated HCl-EtOH, v:v=1:2) and this mixture was added dropwise to a solution of diphosphine (2.5mmol) in a 1:4 mixture of 1,2-dichloroethane/ethanol (100mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at 60°C for 2days and filtered. The resulting solid catalyst was washed successively with ethanol, toluene and dichloromethane, and finally dried under reduced pressure at 60°C for 12h to give the diphosphine-Pd polymer. Polymer catalyst P1. Yield: 1.40g, yellow powder, 89%; Polymer catalyst P2. Yield: 1.49g, brown powder, 85%; Elemental analysis for P1 (C30H24P2PdCl2)n and P2 (C36H28P2PdCl2)n: C: P1, 0.61%; calcd 57.78, found 58.39. P2, 0.63%; calcd 61.80, found 61.17.

P2, 0.23%; calcd 8.87, found 8.64. 2.3 Catalytical testing A mixture of aryl halide (1.0mmol), phenylboronic acid (1.5mmol),K2CO3 (277mg, 2.0mmol) and polymer catalyst (0.3 mol%) in EtOH-H2O (3mL, v:v=1:1) was stirred in a Schlenk tube at room temperature in air. After completion of the reaction, the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase was dried, evaporated and purified by silica gel column chromatography to afford the coupling product. The aqueous phase was filtered and the solid was washed with dichloromethane and reused in further reactions as the recovered catalyst. 3 Results and discussion As shown in Scheme 1 , two diphosphines were prepared through Grignard reaction. The reaction of diphosphine with stoichiometric amount of Palladium chloride at 60°C gave rise to organometallic polymers P1 and P2 in high yield. Both polymers were almost insoluble in water or any common organic solvent. The Pd contents in P1 and P2 were 16.80wt% and 14.36wt%, respectively, as determined by an ICP-AES analysis. Elemental analysis showed that the contents of carbon, hydrogen, phosphorus matched well with the calculated values for the polymers with proposed structures, which were further confirmed by solid-state NMR spectra (Fig. 1 ). The peaks in 13C NMR spectra at about 138ppm was attributed to the P-CAr sites for the two polymers [47]. The signals at around 127–135ppm can be assigned to the other phenyl carbon atoms. In the solid-state 31P NMR spectra for polymer P1, the signal at 23.8 and 17.2ppm can be ascribed to the Pd-P site, which resulted from the different coordination mode (tans and cis) of phosphorus [48]. While for polymer P2, the 31P signal of Pd-P site was almost centered at 23.4ppm. Both polymers exhibit phosphorus signals around −4.5ppm, which were ascribed to uncoordinated end-group P atoms. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. 2 ) showed that P1 and P2 is stable up to about 280 and 310°C, respectively. SEM images display that both polymers consist of micrometer particles and the average particle size of P2 is bigger than that of P1 (Fig. 3 a, b). The catalytic performances of P1 and P2 were then studied in the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of aryl halides and arylboronic acids. Initially, the reaction of 4-bromoanisole with phenylboronic acid was selected as the model reaction and was carried out in H2O/EtOH (1:1v/v) with 0.3mol% Pd catalyst at room temperature in air. As shown in Fig. 4 , the catalytic activity of P2 is slightly higher than that of P1. Solid P1 and P2 gave the 4-methoxy-1,1′-biphenyl in 91 and 98% yields within 3h, respectively. The lower catalytic activity of P1 probably due to its high density of palladium, leading to relatively crowded catalytic environment, which means that the active sites cannot be fully utilized at one moment by substrates. The remarkable advantages of the self-supported heterogeneous catalysts over their homogeneous counterparts are stability and reusability. Inspired by the impressive catalytic activities of P1 and P2, we continued our study by exploring their recyclability in the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling. After each run of the coupling, the catalysts were almost quantitatively recovered. The results showed that P2 still remained good catalytic activity after being used at least six times, while an obvious decline of conversion was observed after the fourth run for P1 (Fig. 5 ). Moreover, the ICP-AES analyses showed that undetectable level of Palladium was leached out into the solution during the reaction. As reported, ultrasound induced obvious scission and reformation of diphosphine-based rganometallic polymers, producing lower-molecular weight materials and may even cause metal leaching [42–44]. This study clearly proved that there were no or undetectable reversible coordination of phosphine happened on our diphosphine-Pd polymers under the reaction conditions. SEM (Fig. 3c, d) images of the recycled catalyst indicated that the morphology was still kept after the coupling reaction. In an effort to confirm that the reaction was catalyzed by heterogeneous Pd instead of free Pd species, the control experiments were performed. Solid catalyst P1 (or P2) and potassium carbonate were added to H2O/EtOH (1:1v/v), and the mixture was ultrasound for 1h and filtered. Then the filtrate was employed for the catalysis of the coupling reaction of 4-bromoanisole with phenylboronic acid under the same experimental conditions. In this case, no product appeared at all after 18h. This phenomenon undoubtedly demonstrated the heterogeneous nature of the catalytic systems. The ICP-AES analyses of the filtrate indicated that no detectable palladium was leached into the solution, which again supported the heterogeneous nature of the catalyst system and highly stability of P1 and P2. Encouraged by these preliminary results, the heterogeneous catalysis of Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of a variety of aryl halides and benzoboric acids was then investigated by using catalyst P2. Excellent results were obtained in the coupling reactions of benzeneboronic acid with a wide range of bromobenzene derivatives. Using both electron-rich and electron-deficient aryl bromides, affording the desired coupling products in >96% yields (entries 1–5, Table 1 ). The coupling reactions of benzoboric acids with ortho-, meta- and para-substituted aryl bromides were performed, giving the corresponding biaryl products in 93–98% yields (entries 6–8, Table 1). Bromobenzenes that contain OH and NH2 groups were also explored and the coupling reactions proceeded very well, giving the desired products in good yields (entries 9 and 10, Table 1). The coupling reactions of bromobenzenes with substituted aryl boronic acids were also performed, and the corresponding biaryl products were obtained in >94% yields, regardless of the electronic and steric nature of these aryl boronic acids (entries 11–16). In the case of iodobenzenes, high yields of 95% were obtained within 1.8h (entry 17). The less active chlorobenzenes only gave a moderate yield (entry 18), elevating temperature or prolonging reaction time did not significantly improve the conversion. As comparisons, the coupling reaction between 4-bromoanisole and phenylboronic acid were carried out with commercial Pd(dppf)Cl2, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 or Pd/C (10wt%) under the same conditions, only 56, 89 and 72% yields were obtained, respectively (entries 19–21, Table 1), any of which was lower than the result of entry 6. In addition, the catalytic efficiency of P2 was higher than that of reported self-supported NHC-Pd catalyst MOMP [49] in the reaction of phenylboronic acid and p-methoxybromobenzene, and somewhat lower than that of NHC-Pd-MCOP [37]. The good catalytic activities of P2 for Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions probably due to its highly dispersed Pd species within the backbone, allowing for more active sites available for the substrates to contact. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, two main-chain diphosphine-Pd organometallic polymers have been successfully prepared by coordination reaction of diphosphines with palladium chloride through a self-supporting strategy. Using as heterogeneous catalysts in Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction, the catalytic activity of P2 is slightly higher than that of P1. The lower activity of P1 probably due to its high density of palladium. In addition, both polymers were highly stable and showed no detectable metal leaching in the reaction process. P2 can be readily recovered and reused for further transformations at least six times without decrease in catalytic activity, while an obvious decline of activity for P1 was observed after the fourth run, indicating that P2 should be a more applicable catalyst. The highly dispersed Pd species within the backbone was supposed to have significant impact on the activities of the self-supported catalysts, which allows for more active sites available for the substrates to contact. This study may open a new door in developing heterogeneous palladium catalysts with high activity and good recyclability in the future.
