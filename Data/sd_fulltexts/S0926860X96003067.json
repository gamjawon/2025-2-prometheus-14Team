Box 1, Sasolburg 9570, South Africa Received 16 March 1996; revised 24 June 1996; accepted 24 June 1996 Abstract Alumina-supported cobalt catalysts have been prepared from different cobalt precursors to study the influence of the precursor on the ultimate metal particle size. Furthermore, the effect of the particle size on the catalytic performance (activity and selectivity) during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis has been investigated. The preparation of low-loaded cobalt catalysts (2.5 wt%) by incipient wetness impregnation using cobalt EDTA and ammonium cobalt citrate precursors resulted initially in very small cobalt oxide particles, as determined by XPS. The small oxide particles reacted during the thermal treatment in a reducing gas flow with the alumina support to cobalt aluminate, which was neither active nor selective during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The catalysts prepared with cobalt nitrate had larger particles that could be easily reduced to metallic cobalt. These catalysts were active under reaction conditions. High-loaded cobalt catalysts (5.0 wt%) prepared using ammonium cobalt citrate showed a larger particle size than the low-loaded catalyst prepared from the citrate precursor. The extent of reduction to metallic cobalt that could be achieved with the high-loaded catalyst was significantly higher than that with the low-loaded catalyst, as shown by magnetic measurements. Accordingly, the high-loaded catalyst exhibited a reasonable activity and, in addition, an interesting and remarkably high selectivity toward higher hydrocarbons, and also a very high Schultz-Flory parameter.

Introduction For the production of higher hydrocarbons from H2/CO mixtures, supported cobalt catalysts are often used. Iglesia et al. [1] reported that the turnover frequency of supported cobalt catalysts does not depend on the nature of the support or on the cobalt dispersion. The CO conversion would only depend on the amount of active sites present in the catalyst [1,2]. Johnson et al. [3] also showed that the dispersion did not affect the activity per active site, but these authors found that the extent of reduction had a large influence on the CO conversion. However, Bessell [4] pointed out that for highly active cobalt catalysts a high dispersion, which implies a large specific active surface, and a low interaction between the support and cobalt are necessary. So, the amount of active sites, which is determined by the dispersion and the extent of reduction, will be important for the catalytic behavior of supported cobalt catalysts. It is usual to prepare supported cobalt catalysts by incipient wetness impreg- nation of cobalt nitrate precursor solutions into pre-shaped support bodies [2,4]. However, as it is also known that nitrate precursors often result in catalysts with relatively large active particles and consequently a small active cobalt surface [5,6], in this study the influence of different cobalt precursors on the particle size of alumina-supported cobalt catalysts is described. Ter/Srde [5] and Van den Brink [6] have obtained small iron particles in silica-supported iron catalysts by using iron EDTA and ammonium iron citrate precursor solutions instead of iron nitrate solutions. Therefore, these precursors are applied in this study to prepare alumina-supported cobalt catalysts. This preparation method can most probably also be applied to other supports such as silica and titania. Subsequently, the effect of the particle size on the catalytic performance during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is investigated. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation All catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous cobalt precursor solutions in pre-shaped alumina support bodies (Engelhard A1-3984 3/-alumina, pore volume 0.48 ml/g, specific surface 110 m2/g) (Table 1). Three different cobalt precursors were used, viz. cobalt nitrate, cobalt EDTA and ammonium cobalt citrate, to obtain the desired active cobalt phase. Cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Fluka Chemika) was commercially available, whereas cobalt EDTA and ammonium cobalt citrate were prepared in our laboratories. To prepare the cobalt EDTA impregnation solution cobalt(II) nitrate and EDTA (titriplex II) were dissolved in a diluted ammonia solution, and subsequently 25% ammonia was added to install the pH at 9. To get the ammonium cobalt J. uan de Loosdrecht et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 365-376 Table 1 Survey of prepared catalysts 367 Catalyst code Loading Support Cobalt precursor Number of (wt%) impregnations 2.5Co/A1203/nitrate 2.5 A1203 nitrate 1 2.5Co/A1203/citrate 2.5 A1203 2 citrate 1 2.5Co/A1203/EDTA 2.5 A1203 EDTA 1 5Co/A1203/nitrate 5.0 A1203 nitrate 1 5Co/A1203/citrate 5.0 A1203 2 citrate 2 10Co/CeO/TiO~ 10 Tit2 nitrate 1 citrate precursor, cobalt(II) nitrate was dissolved in demineralized water and subsequently a KOH solution was slowly added to obtain Co(OH)2. The Co(OH)2 precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed twice with dem- ineralized water and dissolved in citric acid to obtain a cobalt citrate solution with a Co(OH)2 to citric acid ratio of 2. Ammonia (25%) was added to get an ammonium cobalt citrate solution with a pH of 7.5. After impregnation the samples were dried at room temperature in a flow of air for 1 h, subsequently at 333 K for 2 h, and finally at 393 K for another 2 h. All precursors were obtained by one impregnation step, except 5Co/A1203citrate (for catalyst codes see Table 1). To achieve this relatively high loading the support had to be impregnated twice. Bulk ammonium cobalt citrate was prepared by evaporation of the ammonium cobalt citrate solution. To enable us to compare the performance of our catalysts with a cobalt catalyst which is commercially proposed, we prepared also a cerium oxide-pro- moted titania-supported cobalt catalyst, as described in a patent of Exxon [7]. 2.2. Characterization techniques 2.2.1. Temperature-Programmed Reduction (TPR) To study the reduction behavior of the calcined catalysts, TPR experiments were performed. Calcined samples of 50 mg were placed in a quartz reactor of which the temperature was linearly raised from 300 to 1123 K at a rate of 5 K/min, while a flow of 50 ml/min of 10% hydrogen in argon was passed through the sample. Water formed during the reduction was removed from the gas flow using a carbon dioxide/acetone cold trap. The hydrogen concentration was measured with a hot wire detector beyond the trap. 2.2.2. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) To study the distribution of the active phase over the support surface, TEM images were taken. The catalyst samples were ground, ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol and drops of this dispersion were applied onto a holey carbon film supported by a copper grid. The samples were investigated in a Philips EM420 transmission electron microscope operated at 120 kV. 368 J. van de Loosdrecht et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 365-376 2.2.3. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) XPS measurements were executed with a standard Vacuum Generators MT 500/clam-2 spectrometer using Mg K~ radiation produced by a Mg/A1 anode. To calculate the particle sizes from the XPS data, a dispersion analysis program based on a publication of Kuipers [8] and modified by Gijzeman [9] was used. 2.2.4. Magnetic measurements High-field magnetic measurements were performed to study the magnetic properties of the catalysts during reduction. The experiments were executed using a modification of the Weiss-extraction technique as described by Selwood [10]. The apparatus, which has been de- scribed in detail elsewhere [11], enabled us to perform in situ magnetization measurements in the temperature range of 295 to 850 K. Samples could be measured at magnetic field strengths up to 0.85 MAm-1 (1 MAm-~ = 1.26 • 104 Oe). The TPR experiments were done in a 50 ml/min 10%, H2 in helium gas flow at a heating rate of 2 K/min. 2.2.5. Fischer- Tropsch synthesis Fischer-Tropsch synthesis experiments were done in a fully automated micro-flow apparatus with a quartz reactor, i.d. 10 mm, operated at atmospheric pressure. The reaction products were analyzed by means of a Perkin Elmer 8700 gas chromatograph equipped with a FID containing a methanizer. A Poropack Q column was used, which was operated between 353 and 473 K. Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons from methane up to heptane were measured. About 350 mg of catalyst was reduced in situ in a 10% hydrogen in helium gas flow of a flow rate of 100 ml/min. During the reduction, the temperature was linearly raised from 313 to 673 K at a rate of 1 K/min and subsequently kept constant for 9 h at 673 K. Then, the reactor was cooled down to 523 K and a synthesis gas mixture, with H2/CO = 2 and a flow rate of 30 ml/min, was passed through the reactor for 6 h. The syngas concentration in helium was slowly increased up to 100% in 30 min to prevent a large temperature increase in the catalyst bed due to the exothermic reaction. Schultz- Flory parameters were determined from propane to hexane. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Preparation and calcination For all cobalt precursors, a homogeneous distribution of the precursor onto the alumina support is observed with light microscopy immediately after im- pregnation as well as after the drying procedure. No eggshells were observed, J. van de Loosdrecht et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 365-376 369 9 8 6 ~o 5 3 2 200 i I i I i 400 6(10 800 Temperature (K) 1000 Fig. 1. Thermogravic analysis of the oxidation of bulk ammonium cobalt citrate. which means that the macroscopic distribution of the precursors throughout the support bodies was homogeneous. This was also observed with the 5Co/Al203/citrate sample after two impregnation steps. To obtain an active catalyst, the dried catalyst precursors were first calcined to remove nitrate, citrate or EDTA ligands. Then, the oxidic catalyst precursors were reduced to obtain a metallic cobalt phase. To determine a suitable temperature for calcination of the catalyst citrate precursors, a Thermogravic Analysis experiment (TGA) was performed with bulk ammonium cobalt citrate (Fig. 1). Between 298 and 485 K, a very small weight decrease was observed due to the desorption of residual water. Between 485 and 580 K, a large amount of water and ammonia is produced and at 580 K the oxidation of the citrate ligands starts, which is finished at 610 K. After calcination all citrate ligands appeared to be removed and a cobalt oxide phase remains. After calcination the purple color of the dried catalysts had changed into grey/green which points to the presence of CO304. This could not be confirmed by XRD measurements, probably due to the presence of small or amorphous cobalt oxide particles. From the TGA results, it was decided that the supported cobalt precursors were to be calcined at 600 K for 3 h in the reactor. The mean particle size of the cobalt oxide particles was determined by XPS (Table 2). The mean particle size of the alumina-supported catalysts prepared from the nitrate precursor turned out to be much larger than that of the catalysts prepared from the citrate and EDTA precursors. This result was confirmed by TEM observations: small particles in the catalysts prepared with the cobalt Table 2 Particle size of calcined catalysts as determined with XPS Catalyst code Particle size (A) XPS 2.5Co/A1203/nitrate 73 2.5Co/A1203/citrate 17 2.5Co/A1203/EDTA 7 5Co/A1203/nitrate 155 5Co/A1203/citrate 39 370 J. van de Loosdrecht et al. // Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 365-376 citrate and cobalt EDTA precursors, whereas in the catalyst prepared from the nitrate precursor large platelets and clusters were found. Important parameters in catalyst preparation using impregnation techniques are the viscosity of the precursor solution during the drying process and the interaction between the drying precursor solution and the surface of the support [5]. The precursor-support interaction can be raised by increasing the amount of OH groups at the surface of the support as shown by Ter~krde for iron containing catalysts. The effect of the hydroxyl groups was observed for both nitrate and citrate precursors and, therefore, cannot explain the differences in the particle size of our cobalt catalysts. TerSrde reported that the higher viscosity of his ammonium iron citrate precursor solution causes a smaller iron oxide particle size, as compared to the catalysts prepared using the iron nitrate precursor. Therefore, the larger mean particle size of our cobalt catalyst prepared with cobalt nitrate is most likely due to a lower viscosity of this precursor solution. Accordingly, the higher viscosity of the ammonium cobalt citrate and cobalt EDTA precursor solutions will most likely be responsible for the smaller particle size of the final cobalt oxide particles. 3.2. Reduction experiments As mentioned above, the calcined catalyst precursors had to be reduced before use in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The reduction of these oxidic catalyst precursors was studied by means of TPR and magnetic measurements. In Fig. 2 TPR profiles of the calcined catalysts 2.5Co/A1203 ex nitrate, ex citrate and ex EDTA are represented as well as the TPR pattern of bulk Co304, which was obtained by calcination of ammonium cobalt citrate at 600 K for 3 h. The reduction of bulk Co304 starts at 475 K and exhibits a maximum at 625 K. E Fig. 2.

The small shoulder at low temperatures may be due to the reduction of a small amount of Co203. The TPR profiles of the alumina-supported catalysts also exhibit reduction between 450 and 625 K. However, the TPR profiles of these catalysts also show hydrogen consumption between 650 and 1000 K, while above 1050 K an additional hydrogen consumption is observed. The low-temperature reduction step may be the reduction of CO304 to metallic cobalt or the reduction of CO304 to CoO. In this last case, CoO can subsequently react with the support to a cobalt aluminate (CoAI204) of which the reduction proceeds only at high temperatures, explaining the hydrogen consumption above 1050 K [12]. The formation of cobalt aluminate is also indicated by the different colors of the samples after reduction up to 1100 K. The low-loaded catalysts prepared with EDTA and citrate have become blue after reduction due to the formation of cobalt aluminate, whereas the catalyst prepared with nitrate has become grey/black due to the presence of metallic cobalt. The reduction behavior of the supported catalysts could not be explained completely by the results obtained with the TPR experiments. Therefore, the reduction of the oxidic cobalt samples is additionally studied by means of magnetic measurements. In Fig. 3 magnetic measurements of bulk CO304 (ex ammonium cobalt citrate), 2.5/A1203/nitrate and 2.5Co/AleO3/citrate are presented. The mag- netization is measured during temperature-programmed reduction in a hydrogen in helium gas flow. The increase in the magnetization of the CO304 sample starts at 450 K and reaches its maximum magnetization already at 520 K. The increase in the magnetization can be explained by the reduction of paramagnetic Co304 to ferromagnetic metallic cobalt [13]. The reduction starts at almost the same temperature as observed in the TPR profiles.

This difference is presumably due to a different heating rate, viz. 1 K/min during the magnetic measurements and 5 K/min during the TPR experiments. The increase in the magnetization of 2.5Co/A12OB/nitrate catalyst starts at 500 K, whereas the hydrogen consumption during TPR already initiates at 450 K. The different onset temperatures can be attributed to an initial reduction of CO304 to CoO, which does consume hydrogen but does not lead to an increase in the magnetization of the sample, because both cobalt oxides are paramagnetic [13]. Between 500 and 800 K, the magnetization gradually increases most probably due to the formation of ferromagnetic metallic cobalt. After cooling down the magnetization at room temperature of the reduced 2.5Co/A1203/nitrate catalyst remains at a high level as expected. From the magnetization the degree of reduction of the ex nitrate catalyst is calculated to be about 75%. For 2.5Co/AlzO3/citrate the magnetization starts to increase only at about 700 K, while after cooling down the magnetization remains remarkably low. Obviously, the reduction step between 450 and 625 K as observed in TPR hardly causes any increase in the magnetization and has to be due to the reduction of CO304 tO CoO, which subsequently leads to the formation of CoA1204. As this CoA1204 is very difficult to reduce the very low magnetization after cooling down is indicative for the presence of CoA1204. The final amount of metallic cobalt in 2.5Co/A1203/citrate turned out to be about 15% of the total amount of cobalt present in the catalyst, as has been calculated from the magnetization. Apparently, the hydrogen consumption at temperatures lower than about 600 K measured with the TPR profiles of Fig. 2 is only due to reduction to cobalt(II). Even the formation of tiny metallic cobalt particles, which are superparamagnetic, should cause an increase in magnetization. In Fig. 4 magnetic measurements with 5Co/A1203/nitrate and the 5Co/A1203/citrate are shown. The reduction profile of 5Co/A12Oa/nitrate is almost identical to that of 2.5Co/A1203/nitrate, which is included in Fig. 4 for comparison purposes. The main difference is in the degree of reduction, viz. 300O 2500 2000 \"2\", =. 500 o 250 350 450 550 650 750 850 T (K) Fig. 4.

The magneti- zation of 5Co/AlzO3/citrate starts to increase at 550 K, which is about 100 K lower than with the 2.5Co/AlzO3/citrate sample (see Fig. 3). This is most likely due to the difference in particle size causing a change in the ratio of the rate of reaction to CoA1204 and the rate of reduction to metallic cobalt. It turned out that the 5Co/AlzO3/citrate catalyst did not exhibit the blue CoAI204 color after reduction, whereas the 2.5Co/AlzO3/citrate catalyst did. The amount of metallic cobalt in 5Co/AlzO3/citrate formed after reduction is calculated to be 65% of the total amount of cobalt. Obviously, increasing the cobalt loading from 2.5 wt% to 5,0 wt% brings about a considerable increase in the amount of metallic cobalt from 15% to 65%. 3.3. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis In Fig. 5 the CO conversion during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis at 525 K is represented for the low-loaded alumina-supported catalysts. The CO conversion, which remains almost constant, is much higher with the reduced 2.5Co/A1203/nitrate sample than with the reduced 2.5Co/AleO3/EDTA and 2.5Co/A1203/citrate samples. In Table 3 the selectivities of the catalysts, which are constant with time on stream, are represented. The 2.5Co/A1203/nitrate catalyst also produces more higher hydrocarbons (31%) Table 3 Selectivities of the various catalysts during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis Catalyst CO2 CH 4 C 2 C 3 + ot 2.5Co/A1203/nitrate 6 54 9 31 0.46 2.5Co/A1203/citrate 25 56 10 9 0.49 2.5Co/A1203/EDTA 21 57 10 12 0.49 5Co/A1203/nitrate 4 56 9 31 0.47 5Co/A1203/citrate 12 36 8 44 0.69 10Co ICeO/TiO2 2 64 8 26 0.45 374 J. van de Loosdrecht et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 365-376 14 12 8 © 4 r,..) 2 10Co ICeO/TiO2 2.5Co/Al203/nitrate 5Co/Al20~/cilrate I I ~ I l I 1 2 3 4 5 6 Time (hours) Fig. 6.

These differences can be explained by the degree of reduction of the catalysts which is higher for the 2.5Co/A1203/nitrate catalyst, viz. 75%, than for the 2.5Co/A1203/citrate catalyst, viz. 15%, as established by the magnetic mea- surements. Obviously, the 2.5Co/A1203/nitrate catalyst shows the behavior of a metallic cobalt catalyst, whereas the other two catalysts show a deviating behavior due to the presence of CoAI204. In Fig. 6 the activities of the 5Co/A1203/nitrate and the 5Co/AlzO3/citrate catalysts are represented, while those of 2.5Co/A1203/nitrate and 10ColCeO/TiO2 are also included for comparison. The activity of the 5Co/AlzO3/nitrate catalyst is almost twice as high as the activity of the 2.5Co/A1203/nitrate catalyst. This is caused by the higher metal loading, which leads to more metallic cobalt since the degree of reduction is almost the same for both catalysts. The 5Co/AlzO3/citrate catalyst shows a much higher CO conversion than the low-loaded citrate catalyst, which again must be attributed to a higher degree of reduction as was apparent from the magnetic measurements. The selectivities of these catalysts are also presented in Table 3. Both nitrate catalysts show the same selectivity toward higher hydrocarbons (C3+ = 31%) and have the same value for the Schultz-Flory parameter (a---0.46). Remark- able is the high C3+ selectivity (44%) and the high Schultz-Flory parameter (0.69) of the 5Co/A1203/citrate catalyst. Whereas the activity of the catalysts merely reflects the amounts of surface metallic cobalt, the selectivity may depend upon the size of the supported cobalt particles. Apparently, the hydro- genation process proceeds relatively less rapidly on smaller particles, which may be due to a more easy formation of (surface) carbides. With small particles, the penetration of foreign atoms between the metal surface atoms proceeds more easily. J. van de Loosdrecht et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 365-376 375 The initial CO conversion of the commercially proposed 10ColCeO/TiO2 catalyst [7], reduced at 673 K like the other catalysts, is about 11% and declines with time on stream to about 8%. This catalyst shows a C3+ selectivity (26%) and a Schultz-Flory parameter (0.45), which are slightly lower than those found with the nitrate catalysts, but much lower than those observed with the 5Co/Al203/citrate catalyst. The 10ColCeO/TiO2 catalyst was also measured at high pressure (26 bar) and 493 K for 135 h in syngas with H2CO = 2. The selectivity toward higher hydrocarbons (C5÷) in this experiment was 87%, whereas the methane selectivity was only 7%. This measurement shows that the hydrocarbon yield can be increased significantly by increasing the pressure during the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The hydrocarbon selectivity of the 5Co/A1203/citrate catalyst measured at low-pressure Fischer-Tropsch synthe- sis, which is higher than for the 10ColCeO/TiO2 catalyst, is very promising for use at high-pressures. 4. Conclusions The preparation of low-loaded cobalt catalysts (2.5 wt%) by incipient wetness impregnation using cobalt EDTA and ammonium cobalt citrate precursors results initially in very small cobalt oxide particles. The small oxide particles react during the thermal treatment in a reducing gas flow with the alumina support to cobalt aluminate, which is neither active nor selective during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Catalysts prepared with cobalt nitrate have larger particles which can easily be reduced to metallic cobalt. These catalysts are active under reaction conditions. High-loaded cobalt catalysts (5.0 wt%) prepared using ammonium cobalt citrate show a larger particle size than the low-loaded catalyst prepared from this citrate precursor. The extent of reduction to metallic cobalt that can be achieved with the high-loaded catalyst is significantly higher than that with the low-loaded catalyst. Accordingly, the high-loaded catalyst exhibits a reasonable activity. Most interesting, however, is the remarkably high selectivity toward higher hydrocarbons and the very high Schultz-Flory parameter. Hence, it turned out that the optimum catalyst precursor has to contain cobalt oxide particles sufficiently large to avoid complete reaction with the support to cobalt aluminate, but sufficiently small to exhibit favorable selectivity toward higher hydrocarbons.

Alumina-supported cobalt catalysts have been prepared from different cobalt precursors to study the influence of the precursor on the ultimate metal particle size. Furthermore, the effect of the particle size on the catalytic performance (activity and selectivity) during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis has been investigated. The preparation of low-loaded cobalt catalysts (2.5 wt%) by incipient wetness impregnation using cobalt EDTA and ammonium cobalt citrate precursors resulted initially in very small cobalt oxide particles, as determined by XPS. The small oxide particles reacted during the thermal treatment in a reducing gas flow with the alumina support to cobalt aluminate, which was neither active nor selective during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.

The extent of reduction to metallic cobalt that could be achieved with the high-loaded catalyst was significantly higher than that with the low-loaded catalyst, as shown by magnetic measurements. Accordingly, the high-loaded catalyst exhibited a reasonable activity and, in addition, an interesting and remarkably high selectivity toward higher hydrocarbons, and also a very high Schultz-Flory parameter.
