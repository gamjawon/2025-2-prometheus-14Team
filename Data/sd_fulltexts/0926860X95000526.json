It was based on oxidation of the prereduced catalyst in a liquid suspension with chromate and with potentiometric indication. It was shown that, as compared with a standard BET measurement of metal blacks, such a technique gave excellent results, especially for ruthenium black and SiO2- and AlzO3-supported catalysts. These supports did not follow redox surface changes. On the other hand the method was less accurate for active carbon-supported ruthenium, since a considerable volume of the titrating agent was consumed by support surface composition changes.

Introduction As compared to the other the Group VIII metals, ruthenium shows an increased selectivity to partial hydrogenation of benzene and its derivatives to cyclohexene and the corresponding cycloalkenes [ 1-5]. Ruthenium catalysts have also been widely used for selective hydrogenation of a carbonyl group conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring [6-8]. In view of these noteworthy properties, a detailed physical and chemical characterization is of fundamental importance.

Paseka et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 33~40 tion (TPR/TPD) and titration methods have usually been applied in the surface area determination of supported and unsupported ruthenium catalysts. Such meth- ods are almost exclusively based on the surface adsorption/desorption of oxygen, hydrogen or carbon monoxide [9-20]. It has been shown that the chemisorption stoichiometry results from certain presumptions of the experimentalist, and accord- ingly it varies from author to author [ 19-25]. Working with ruthenium black, it is useful if chemisorption results might be compared with independent BET meas- urements of the surface area [20,26] and consequently the chemisorption stoichi- ometry should be corrected. Currently the number of chemisorbed hydrogen atom species in a monolayer per square meter of surface area of unsupported ruthenium is determined, which is essential in calculating the free-metal surface area of sup- ported catalysts from chemisorption isotherms. The usefulness of titration as a characterization tool for the catalyst can be enhanced by applying it to the oxidation of surface sorbed hydrogen in the liquid phase, using potentiometric indication of the suspension potential. The method involves oxidation of adsorbed hydrogen by a suitable oxidizing agent. This pro- vides us with an accurate measure of the volume of titrating agent consumed for a certain potential of the suspension vs. time during the titration. This method has already been applied for the determination of adsorbed hydrogen on platinum- and palladium-supported catalysts [ 27,28 ]. Utilization of the method for the evaluation of the amount of adsorbed hydrogen on the ruthenium surface is, however, some- what limited. It was shown by many authors reporting on surface sorption of hydrogen either from the gas phase [ 19-25] or from the liquid phase of an electro- lyte in electrochemical adsorption [29-32], that a reliable evaluation of a stoichi- ometric ratio H/Ru is questionable. In experiments with adsorption from the gas phase the ratio usually approached a value ofH/Ru = 1 [20,25]. On the other hand in electrochemical adsorption in the liquid phase the ratio was much lower (H/ Ru~0.50-0.66) [29,30]. The determination of the true H/Ru stoichiometry is also influenced by the solubility of hydrogen in the crystallite lattice of ruthenium [ 31 ]. Furthermore, the use of this method is questionable as it is not possible to establish reliably the volume of the titrating agent that is consumed for the oxidation of adsorbed hydrogen from the beginning of the oxidation of the ruthenium surface [ 29,33,34]. Modified methods, using surface adsorption of carbon monoxide [30] and underpotentially deposited copper [35,36], are also reported. A quantitative electrochemical oxidation of these compounds adsorbed in a monolayer is possible. Consequently, the surface area of ruthenium is evaluated from the charge used for the oxidation of carbon monoxide or copper. The main drawback of these processes comes from their limitation to only unsupported ruthenium catalysts (e.g., ruthe- nium black). In this paper we report on the determination of the ruthenium surface area by means of the oxidation of the prereduced surface using a suitable oxidizing agent. The second method tested is based on the reverse process, e.g. reduction of surface oxide by using a suitable titrating agent in an acidic liquid phase. The considerations L Paseka et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 33~t0 35 of potential stabilities of individual ruthenium oxides (RuO, Ru203, RuO2, RuO4) showed that for the purposes mentioned above the oxidation of ruthenium to RuO2 is the best acceptable process. Since this reaction proceeds in the range of the potentials 0.8-1.2 V [ 33,34], the selection of the titrating agent is also determined by this potential. The standard redox potential of the oxidizing agent must be in the range of E= 1.2-1.3 to avoid a possible further oxidation of ruthenium [34,37] to unstable RuO4. Bearing these facts in mind, a solution of Cr207- was chosen (E= 1.23 V, [38] ). For the reverse process -- reduction of RuO2 -- strong reducing agents are inevitable, because of the difficult reduction of ruthenium oxides [30]. Experimental conditions have to be found in order to eliminate pos- sible decomposition of water and consumption of an agent in this process. With this in mind a chromium(II) salt-based reducing agent was selected (E~ = - 0.407 V, [38]). In this study we seek to evaluate effectiveness, reliability and reproducibility of the two suggested titration methods (reduction, oxidation) with potentiometric indication for ruthenium surface area determination. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials The unsupported ruthenium catalyst Ru-1 was prepared by means of hydrogen reduction of RuO2 (Fluka). Conditions were given elsewhere [39,40]. Catalysts Ru-2 and Ru-3 came from chemically reduced RuC13. nH20 (Fluka) making use of NaBH4 as reducing agent [41,42]. Alumina (Pural SB, Condea, SBET = 150 m2/ g) and active charcoal (Degussa, Supersorbon, SBET= 1200 m2/g) supported cat- alysts were prepared by means of a conventional impregnation technique in excess water as the impregnation solvent [ 5 ]. Oxidizing ( KzCr20v ) and reducing (CrC12) agents were standard products of Lachema and Aldrich, respectively. 2.2. Characterization of the catalysts The BET surface areas of the Ru- 1 to Ru-3 catalysts and of the supports ( alumina, charcoal) were measured on a BET apparatus Digisorb 2600 (Micrometrics, USA). The SBET areas were calculated from nitrogen physisorption isotherms at 78 K, taking the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule to be 0.162 nm2. The surface area measurements were carried out in a glass titration vessel (30 cm3) equipped with standard calomel and platinum electrodes. A catalyst sample (0.01 - 0.15 g) dispersed in sulphuric acid (0.01 M) was introduced and the magnetically stirred mixture was heated to 355 K in flowing hydrogen. During the reduction the electrochemical potential of the mixture was continuously recorded. Upon reaching the equilibrium potential (usually after 5-20 min) of the hydrogen electrode (En~ -0.260 V/SCE), the reduction was completed in one to three 36 1.

Before the titration, the glass container was thoroughly purged with oxygen- free nitrogen for 10 rain. The reduced metal was oxidized with 0.02 N K2Cr207, dosed by a dosing pump with a titration velocity v ~ 0.001 cm3/s. A plotted record (E versus time) showed the amount of titrating agent consumed (Fig. 1). Generally in an analogous way the reduction of the surface RuO2 was performed making use of Cr2+ salt (0.01 M) as a reducing agent. In both cases the following reaction scheme was assumed.

Ox indicates the oxidiz- ing agent and HOx its reduced form. The experimental results reported in this paper were based on the value of 1.22.1019 atoms per mz as the mean surface density for ruthenium metal [ 19,22]. 3. Results and discussion In order to obtain the equivalent point of titration and consequently the specific surface area of ruthenium active sites, the potentiometric oxidation potential E~ vs. time curve (Fig. 1) was treated as indicated. Fig. 2 shows the a and b reduction courses corresponding to the Ru/C catalyst and to the support, respectively. The 1.

From results gathered in Table 1 some points emerge. The problems usually encountered in surface chemisorption measurements of sup- ported catalysts might be, to a certain extent, avoided using metal black first, to assess the reliability of the chosen method. As is clearly seen, the BET surface areas (SBET) of samples Ru-1 to Ru-3 correspond well with the values determined by means of the potentiometric oxidation with chromate. It is of considerable importance that in both, independent, methods the mean difference between the results does not exceed 3.7%. The above facts suggest that the proposed oxidation- O0 02 04 06 t larb. units Fig. 3. Titration of the ruthenium-free charcoal support oxidation (1) and of the Ru-5 catalyst (2).

Above all, looking at the experimental data in columns A and B (Table 1, Ru-1 to Ru-3), it is seen that the total volume of the oxidizing agent consumed might be separated into two portions. The former pertains to the volume consumed on oxidation of the surface-adsorbed hydrogen, the latter on oxidation of metallic ruthenium to the surface oxides. It also appears that the stoichiometry of the oxidation process complies with the generally accepted value for hydrogen surface coverage 0H=0.5 (at 355 K). As shown above, this technique seems to be able to give us an accurate measure of the ruthenium specific surface area. Alumina and active charcoal supports were employed in this study and the corresponding catalysts were marked Ru-4 and Ru- 5, respectively. Owing to the presence of the support and because of the nature of physisorption, the BET surface measurements were of no use in comparison with the oxidation-titration method. Nevertheless, on the basis of the ruthenium black results, and considering the similar E vs. time curves, it is reasonable to assume that the application of the method might be extended to either supported ruthenium catalytic systems. Due to the chemistry and high stability of A1203, the alumina support remains almost intact during the whole course of the oxidation-reduction procedure, and the surface area evaluation of the Ru-4 catalyst is straightforward. It is shown that the chromate consumed in the oxidation of the prereduced support does not exceed 10% of the total titration volume necessary for oxidation of the catalyst. Dealing with alumina- and active charcoal-supported ruthenium catalysts partic- ular interest lays in the latter because of the presence of variable redox surface groups. The variations in redox state occurring during the titration process are accompanied by a change of the redox potential of the support and apparently such variations are responsible for a substantial volume of the titrating agent consumed 1. Paseka et al./ Applied Catalysis A.\" General 128 (1995) 33~40 39 exclusively on the support. It should be pointed out that the oxidation of the active charcoal surface groups requires approx. 75% of the total volume of the titrating agent used. It also appears that the ruthenium-free charcoal support cannot simply be reduced as can the Ru-5 catalyst ( Fig. 2). The explanation is not straightforward; however, it might be sought in terms of the selective action of hydrogen molecules and atoms. The former are responsible of the free support reduction, and partici- pation of the latter cannot be expected. On the other hand, hydrogen atoms, mainly due to spillover and increased surface migration, may participate in the reduction of the catalyst simultaneously with hydrogen. Both the catalyst and the support were reduced for an hour after reaching the suspension electrochemical potential equal to EH (EH ~-- --0.260 V/SCE). Such a period was sufficient to obtain repro- ducible data, and further prolongation had almost no effect. As is seen in Table 1, the reverse process -- reduction of the surface oxygen -- cannot easily be used to provide quantitative information of the ruthenium surface area. On the basis of the experimental data a preliminary conclusion is drawn that the surface oxygen chemisorption proceeds as a multilayer adsorption. This tenta- tive interpretation complies with the significantly higher ruthenium surface areas observed than when using the BET method and the oxidation-titration approach (Ru-1 to Ru-3). In view of the above facts, the usefulness of TPR (Mdndzo et al. [19] ) as a suitable characterization tool for Ru/C dispersion evaluation is not entirely acceptable, especially when bearing in mind that the method assumes monolayer oxygen coverage. Apart from the effect of the surface coverage, the TPR profile, particularly on active charcoal-supported catalysts, certainly reflects surface support changes (reduction) within the experimental temperature range reported (298-500 K) [19]. In this case special attention should be paid to a relevant interpretation of the TPR profile, since due to the low reduction rate of the ruthenium-free charcoal, the changes in the support could easily be neglected. 4. Conclusion Although the surface area characterization of ruthenium catalysts is usually performed by chemisorption and TPR/TPD methods, the availability of an inex- pensive and experimentally simple method has been a subject of permanent interest. The oxidation of the metal with an aqueous chromate solution and potentiometric indication seems to be such a technique. The method has the potential to supply us with reliable surface area data both of supported and unsupported ruthenium cata- lysts. Some limitations have been observed when using charcoal-supported catalysts with reducible surface groups. The reverse process, reduction of the sorbed oxygen, is not entirely adequate, because of the nonspecific multilayer oxygen adsorption.

A method for the surface area determination of metallic ruthenium was tested. It was based on oxidation of the prereduced catalyst in a liquid suspension with chromate and with potentiometric indication. It was shown that, as compared with a standard BET measurement of metal blacks, such a technique gave excellent results, especially for ruthenium black and SiO2- and Al2O3-supported catalysts. These supports did not follow redox surface changes. On the other hand the method was less accurate for active carbon-supported ruthenium, since a considerable volume of the titrating agent was consumed by support surface composition changes.
