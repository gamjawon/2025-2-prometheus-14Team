As one of its applications related to WGSR, reduction of aromatic nitro compounds using CO and water has drawn considerable attention [ 2 ] , and many studies have already been published [3]. ArN02 +3CO+H20--- ArNH2+3C02 Recently, we discovered new catalyst systems which exhibit remarkably high catalytic activities as well as extremely high nitro-group selectivities for the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds, affording the corresponding amines under the mild reaction conditions of room temperature and atmospheric pressure of carbon monoxide**. Here, we report that RhB(CO)16 catalysts added with small amounts of amines or diamines in 2-methoxyethanol/5 N NaOH aq. solution also exhibit remarkably high catalytic activities for this reduction, even under the mild reaction conditions of room temperature (25 C) and 1 atm CO! These reductions were typically carried out as follows: a solution of Rhss(CO)16 (0.041 mmol) in 2-methoxyethanol (15 lnl) under nitrogen atmosphere was stirred and added to a prescribed amount of amine. Then, addition of aqueous 5 N NaOH solution (5 ml) and aromatic nitro compounds (5 mmol) into the reaction mixture was followed by the introduction of carbon monoxide. The mixture, equipped with a CO gas bag, was allowed *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. **We recently found other new catalyst systems for the selective reduction of aromatic nitro compounds under the mild reaction conditions of room temperature and CO atmosphere. These papers will be published elsewhere. tSome reports have already been made using these reaction conditions, however, their catalytic activities are low (for example, 6 g-atom Ru h-' from [3(a)]). 0304-5102/91/$ 3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands L12 TABLE 1 Catalytic reduction of aromatic nitro compounds affording corresponding amines using amineadded Rhe(CO)18 catalysts under CO/1120 conditions Amine Molar Compounds Turnover ratio' (mol-cat-1 h-') (g-atom Rh-' h_i) Me2N(CHz)9NMe2 1 p-nitrotoluene 1050 (175) o-phenanthroline 1 p-nitrotoluene 738 (123) PhCH2NMe2 3 p-nitrotoluene 1218 (203) N\"Bu3 3 p-nitrotoluene 1008 (168) 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)- 1.5 p-nitroanisole 1776 (296) naphthalene 2-hydroxypyridine 3 p-nitroanisole 1764 (294) PhCH2NMe2 3 p-nitroanisole 1350 (225) N Bu3 3 p-nitroanisole 1416 (236) none - nitrobenzene 486 (81) 'Amount of amine or diamine (mmol)/amount of catalyst metal (mmol). bRhs(CO),e 0.001 mmol, 5 h. to react at room temperature (25 C) for 1 h. The reaction product was then determined by GLC using an internal standard, and was identified by the co-injection method in GLC with an authentic sample (column OV-225) and GC-MS (QP-1000 Shimazu Co. Ltd.). The only reaction product was the corresponding amine, and no other products were observed. Results for the reduction of p-nitroanisole and p-nitrotoluene with various amine-added Rhs(CO)16 catalysts are summarized in Table 1. It should be noted that the reduction rate remarkably increased with the addition of amines, especially N, N-dimethylbenzylamine, N, N, N', N'tetramethyl-1,4-butanediamine and tri-n-butylamine for the reduction of pnitrotoluene, affording p-toluidine, and 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene, 2-hydroxypyridine, and tri-n-butylamine for the reduction of p-nitroanisole to yield p-anisidine. It is also considered important that the turnover frequencies (TOF) for p-nitroanisole were higher than those for p-nitrotoluene (cf. 1416 mol-cat-1 h-1 for p-nitroanisole and 1008 mol-cat-1 h-1 for p-nitrotoluene in the case of tri-n-butylamine additive) and it was revealed that the most effective amine was different from that for p-nitrotoluene. A catalytic activity (TOF) of 1776 mol-cat-1 h-1 (296 g-atom Rh-1 h-1) was obtained for the reduction of p-nitroanisole even under these extremely mild reaction conditions. The catalytic activities shown in Table 1 are, as far as we know, much higher than those previously reported.* *Some reports have already been made using these reaction conditions, however, their catalytic activities are low (for example, 6 g-atom Ru h-' from [3(a)J). L13 Factors affecting these reduction rates and their reduction mechanism are now under investigation.* Acknowledgts The authors would like to express grateful thanks to Dr. Gohfu Suzukamo (Organic Synthesis Research Laboratory Sumitomo Chem.
