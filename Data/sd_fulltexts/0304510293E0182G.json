Mokrinski Boreskov Institute of Catalysis, 630090, Novosibirsk (Russian Federation) (Received April 3, 1993; accepted June 21, 1993 ) Abstract The 61V and 1H solid-state NMR data show the formation in V205-TiO2-SiO2 catalysts of a number of surface tetrahedral and octahedral V complexes, with their types depending upon the sequence of titanium deposition. Among them triple complexes containing V, Ti and Si together have been found. Key words: high-resolution solid-state NMR spectroscopy; silica; surface complexes; titania; vanadia Introduction Recently, much attention has been paid to the mixed V205/Ti02/Si02 catalysts which were shown to possess higher activity and selectivity in the reduction of nitrogen oxides with ammonia in comparison to V205/Si02 catalysts [ 1-5 ] . Application of Si02 as a support for V205/Ti02 catalysts significantly increases the surface area and their resistance to sintering [ 1-5 ] . Nevertheless, no intensive studies on the mixed oxide systems have been provided. Recently [ 5 ] , the Raman spectroscopy data on the structure of a series Of V205/TiO2/SiO2 catalysts and their activity in methanol oxidation were presented. At Ti02 concentrations of less than 3%, only surface TiOx particles were present in Ti02/SiO2 samples. An increase of the Ti02 concentration up to 40% resulted in the formation of the bulk Ti02 particles (anatase). At vanadium concentrations of 3% in 3% Ti02/SiO2 and 4% in 40% Ti02/SiO2 only the surface oxide phase of vanadium was formed, vanadium interacts predominantly with Ti02. The activity of such a catalyst was two times higher than that Of VZO5/Si02. In the presence of bulk Ti02 particles a further increase of the activity up to the values typical for the surface forms of vanadium on mas- *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 - Elsevier Science B.V.

This indicates the higher activity of the surface forms of vanadium in the presence of the massive Ti02. It has been found recently that 'IV and'H high-resolution solid state NMR can be effectively used for characterization of supported vanadium catalysts [ 6-12 ] . 'IV NMR provides information on the local environment of vanadium atoms in supported species while'H MAS NMR can be used for the monitoring of the interaction between supported species and surface OH groups [6-12 ] . Here we present the data on the studies with the use of both 5'V and 'H NMR Of V205-TiO2-SiO2 catalysts (named below as V/Ti/Si catalysts) prepared under various sequences of deposition of V and Ti. Experimental The samples under study were prepared by the standard incipient-wetness method described elsewhere [ 5 ] . The V/Ti/Si and Ti/V/Si samples were prepared by consecutive impregnations Of Si02 with an ethanol solution of TiC14 and a water solution Of VOC204 (V/Ti/Si samples) or with a water solution Of VOC204 and then with an ethanol solution of TiC14 (Ti/V/Si) samples. The (V-Ti) /Si samples were obtained via simultaneous impregnation of Si02 with a water+ ethanol solution Of VOC204 and TiC14. The samples were treated in a quartz flow reactor at 250 C for 3 h in OZ flow (50 ml/min). Then the samples were cooled at room temperature, placed in ampoules for NMR measurements and sealed off. The treatment in the reaction mixture (2% H2S,1% 02 in He) was performed under the same conditions. Hydration of the samples was performed by their exposure to the atmosphere moisture during 10 h at room temperature. The 5'V NMR spectra were measured using a Bruker MSL-400 spectrometer (magnetic field 9.39 T) at 105.2 MHz in the frequency range 250 kHz, 2 ps radiofrequency pulses were used to excite -1/2 to 1/2 transition in solid samples. The pulse repetition rate was 1 to 0.1 Hz. Spectra were measured in sealed quartz ampoules. Magic angle spinning was performed at a rotation frequency of 4 kHz. Chemical shifts were measured with respect to external VOC13. The 'H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker CXP-300 spectrometer (field 7.04 T, frequency 300.066 MHz) at room temperature. The duration of the pulse was 5 .ts, spectra range was 50 kHz, number of scans was 500. Chemical shifts were measured relative to tetramethylsilane as an external reference. The samples were placed in glass tubes of 7 mm outer diameter and 12 mm long, equipped with a capillary for the connection with vacuum system, and were evacuated for 26 h at 250 C. Then, the samples were unsealed and introduced into a glass mushroom rotor. The rotation frequency was 3 kHz. The quantities of hydroxyl groups in the samples were determined by compar- O.B. Oina et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 87 (1994) 57-66 59 ison of signal intensities of OH groups with those of the reference (Si02 dehydrogylated at 300 C) . Results The 61V NMR spectra of V/Si, V/Ti/Si (5,15% Ti02), (V-Ti)/Si (10% Ti02), Ti/V/Si (10% Ti02) samples (10% of V205 in all samples) are presented in Fig. 1, spectra 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. The spectrum of V/Si02 (spectrum 1) contains the lines of two types: a line with 81= -510 ppm, d8~. 500 ppm was assigned in accord with the data of refs. 7-9, to vanadium in a tetrahedral coordination and a line with o1= - 290 ppm, d8 ~ 1000 ppm was assigned to vanadium in a distorted octahedral coordination (spectrum 1, Fig. 1). A line of small intensity from octahedral vanadium with 81 ,:t~ - 230 ppm is also superimposed on the line with 81= - 290 ppm (spectrum 1, Fig. 1). The deposition of Ti onV/Si02results in (i) disappearance of the line of vanadium in distorted octahedral coordination (81= - 290 ppm), (ii) subsequent decrease of the line of vanadium in tetrahedral coordination (81= - 500 ppm) and (iii) simultaneous appearance of the line with full anisotropy of the chemical shift tensor with 81= -270 ppm, 82= - 500 ppm, 83= -820 ppm and d8= 550 ppm typical for vanadium in the distorted tetrahedral coordination (spectra 2 and 3, Fig. 1) . At the joint deposition of V and Ti on Si02 three lines are observed belonging to (i) vanadium in tetrahedral coordination with 8 t~ - 485 ppm, (ii) to octahedral vanadium with 81= - 220 ppm typical for V /Si02 and a new line with a maximum at - 770 ppm (spectrum 4, Fig. 1) . The change of the sequence of Ti and V deposition (sample V/Ti/Si) provides the spectrum containing two lines (similar to V/Si02): (i) an intense line with 8 ,t~ - 460 ppm arising from tetrahedral particles and (ii) a weak line with 81 - 280 ppm belonging to octahedral particles. Note, that the contribution of tetrahedral particles is significantly higher in this sample, than in the case of V/Si02 (spectrum 5, Fig. 1). The 61V NMR MAS spectra of V/Si, Ti/V/Si (15% Ti02), (V-Ti)/Si, V/Ti/Si do not possess highly resolved spinning side bands. Thus, it is not possible to determine the isotropic shifts of the separate peaks. However, a small narrowing of the lines and their shifts allows the precise determination of the anisotropy parameters of the lines mentioned above. Actually these parameters are close to the ones given above. Several precise determinations can be provided for the line with a full anisotropy of the chemical shift tensor typical for Ti/V/Si samples (81= -280 ppm, 82= -560 ppm, a3= =850 ppm) and for the high field line in (V-Ti) /Si sample (its shift is - 800 to - 850 ppm ). 60 O.B.

Then samples were cooled and sealed off. The hydration of the V/Si, Ti/V/Si, (V-Ti)/Si, V/Ti/Si samples changes the spectra (Fig. 2). For V/Si02 the intensity of tetrahedral vanadium line decreases and a broader (in comparison to non-hydrated samples) line from octahedral vanadium with 81= - 305 ppm ( spectrum 1, Fig. 2 ) appears. Similar changes are observed in the case of Ti/V/Si. However, the line with full anisotropy of the chemical shift tensor remains unchanged (spectra 2 and 3, Fig. 2). The spectrum of the V/Ti/Si sample is similar to that of V/Si, only the contribution of the tetrahedral forms is somewhat higher. Treating V/Si, Ti/V/Si, (V-Ti)/Si with the reaction mixture (2% H2S, 1 % 02 ) significantly reduces the vanadium, providing the paramagnetic species which are unobservable by 61V NMR. The total intensity of the spectrum decreases, the majority of the lines disappear, and only a line of low intensity O.B. Lapina et al. / J Mol.

The 1H NMR spectra of the samples are presented in Fig. 4. The data on the OH group content in various samples are collected in Table 1. The Si02 spectrum (spectrum 1) has a narrow intense line at 1.6 ppm with a small shoulder at 3 ppm, attributed to the isolated Si-OH groups of Si02 [ 12 J (OH group concentration is (4.5 0.5) X 10-2 per g). The deposition of vanadium is accompanied by a significant decrease of the signal intensity (spectrum 4, Fig. 4 ). The line at 1.6 ppm decreases to a greater extent, than the signal at 3 ppm, which is clearly seen in the side bands region. At Ti02 deposition the total concentration of the protons practically does not change (spectrum 3). At simultaneous and layer deposition of V205 and Ti02 the concentration of protons decreases as indicated in Table 1 and in Fig. 4 (spectra 2, 5, 6). 62 -500 -1100 -500 -290 1040 0 -500 -1000 -1500 PPM O.B.

The types of the complexes forming and their characteristics are presented in Table 2 and in Fig. 5.

Catal. 87 (1994) 57-66 V species on the surfaces of the V/Si, Ti/V/Si and (Ti-V)/Si samples since the concentration of surface Si-OH groups decreases in these catalysts as compared with Si02 itself. In contrast, for Ti/Si samples the formation of large TiOx particles on Si02 surface takes place since the concentration of Si-OH groups only slightly decreases in this case. The \"V NMR data show that in V/Si system two types of surface complexes are formed: tetrahedral (able to bind H20 into the first coordination sphere with a subsequent formation of octahedral vanadium complexes) and octahedral precursors of V205 (Fig. 5 ).These data agree with the earlier results presented in refs. 6 and 10. Deposition of Ti on V/Si samples actually does not change the concentration of hydroxyl groups due to formation of large TiOx particles (Fig. 5) but creates the new tetrahedral vanadium complexes possessing 61V NMR spectrum with full anisotropy of the chemical shift tensor. This spectrum does not change upon water adsorption. The formation of new tetrahedral vanadium complexes on the layer titanium deposition on V/Si is likely to be accompanied by the formation of the triple V-Ti-Si complexes (triplets), since neither in V/Si nor in V/Ti samples have such complexes been observed. At the simultaneous deposition of vanadium and titanium on the surface of Si02 three types of complexes are formed: two tetrahedral complexes and one octahedral. All three types of complexes differ from those formed in the V/Si and V/Ti systems. The tetrahedral states with 8~ -485 ppm and octahedral ones with 8~zi -220 ppm are quite similar to those of the V/Si system. The tetrahedral state with 8-800 ppm is not typical for either the V/Si or the V/Ti systems and is likely to correspond to V-Ti-Si complexes with vanadium bonded through oxygen to Si and Ti (triplet complexes) (Fig. 5 ). The formation of triplets was also observed at the layer deposition of vanadium and titanium in Ti/V/Si samples (Fig. 5). However, both types of triple V-Ti-Si complexes possess different spectral characteristics and reveal different behavior in respect to hydration. The V-Ti-Si complexes obtained under the layer deposition have the distorted tetrahedral environment similar to that in metavanadates [6] and are not available for water molecules. At the simultaneous deposition the V-Ti-Si complexes become available for water and easily change their coordination to that of octahedral. The observed effects can be explained in the following way. At the layer deposition some part of vanadium in Ti/V/Si samples (V-Ti-Si) complexes is screened in the second layer, while at the simultaneous deposition, the VTi-Si complexes are formed on the Si02 surface. The samples obtained via the layer deposition of V and Ti in the reverse order (V/Ti/Si) actually do not differ from V/Si system. This is possible when Ti is not uniformly distributed over the surface of Si02, but forms sufficiently large Ti02 associates. This does not change considerably the support surface and vanadium is deposited on Si02 as in the V/Si bi-system. On the other hand, the Ti02 complexes seem to be weakly bonded to the support (Si02) and O.B. Lapina et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 87 (1994) 57-66 65 can readily rearrange to give rather large Ti02 particles clearing the support surface. This interpretation is in accord with 1H NMR data. The significant decrease of OH-groups concentration at vanadium deposition on silica corresponds to the formation of surface complexes of the VOx/Si02 type. The small change of the OH-group concentration at Ti deposition on silica is likely to be the result of the formation of massive Ti02 particles on the surface of the support, when the larger surface area remains free. The subsequent V deposition results in the predominant anchoring of vanadium on the free surface of the support. When titanium is deposited after vanadium (Ti/V/Si ), it appears to be anchored on vanadium (as confirmed by 51V NMR data). This provides a significantly larger Ti-containing surface. The treatment of the samples under the reaction conditions results in the reduction of associated octahedral complexes as well as of triplet V-Ti-Si complexes. Tetrahedral complexes typical for V/Si system appear to be more stable and less active in redox reactions. Conclusion The results presented above demonstrate that the simultaneous studies of s1V and 1H MAS NMR provide important information on the interaction and the types of complexes formed in the triple V205-TiO2-SiO2 system. From the 1H NMR MAS data it follows that V205 interacts both with Si02 and Ti02, while in the Si02-TiO2 system, the formation of large Ti02-line species takes place. The latter interact with V species supported either before or after Ti02 deposition. It was found from b1V NMR data that the structure of surface V complexes depends on the sequence of V and Ti deposition. The formation of several surface tetrahedral and octahedral complexes as well as two types of the mixed triple V-Ti-Si complexes on the Si02 surface has been found. The latter are of two types. The first one is formed after Ti deposition on Si02 surface which already contains supported V species and can be attributed to V atoms in highly distorted tetrahedral environment. The second type of complexes belongs to the V in nearly regular tetrahedral environment and is formed after simultaneous deposition of V and Ti on Si02 surface. The treatment of catalysts under the conditions of the H2S+O2 reaction results in the reduction of both tetrahedral and octahedral V species, with tetrahedral V being more stable in this reaction, but comparison with catalytic data is necessary to reveal which types of complexes are responsible for catalytic activity.
