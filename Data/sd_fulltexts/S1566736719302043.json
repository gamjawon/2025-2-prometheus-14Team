TiO2-modified boron self-doped carbon/nano B4C (TiO2/B-C/B4C) was used as a non-noble metal electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.1 M KOH. Titanium oxide-modified boron carbide (TiO2/B4C) was prepared by microwave treatment of the mixture of titanyl sulfate and B4C. TiO2/B-C/B4C was obtained after heating the TiO2/B4C at 700 °C in vacuum for 3 h. The TiO2/B-C/B4C exhibited a good ORR activity with an average electron transfer number of 3.9, which was close to that obtained with 20 wt% Pt electrocatalyst. The resultant TiO2/B-C/B4C electrocatalyst showed satisfying OER performance with an overpotential of 0.31 V at 10 mA cm−2. Thus, the TiO2/B-C/B4C electrocatalyst with good ORR/OER activity can be potentially used for unitized regenerative fuel cells in new generation energy-storage systems. Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Keywords Nano boron carbide Titanium oxide Boron self-doped carbon Oxygen reduction reaction Oxygen evolution reaction 1 Introduction With the aggravation of environmental pollution and climate change, people have realized that the energy supply system needs to be developed in the direction of renewable and non-contaminant alternatives. Metal-air batteries and unitized regenerative fuel cells are considered highly important due to their high energy density and lack of pollution [ 1,2 ]. One key issue in the development of fuel cells and metal-air batteries is the exploitation of high activity and stability bifunctional materials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As the most effective ORR electrocatalyst, platinum (Pt) catalysts have poor catalytic activity toward OER [ 3 ], while ruthenium (Ru), iridium (Ir) and their oxides as ones of the best OER catalysts are not so active for ORR [ 4,5 ]. Although, their alloys are now often used as efficient bifunctional catalysts. The factors limiting their further development include: the high cost, low stability and their harmful effects to the environment [ 6,7 ]. In recent years, the development of low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for the ORR and OER with both high catalytic activity and durability to replace traditional commercial catalysts has been considered as a feasible way. Among all inexpensive electrocatalysts, the most widely used are doped carbon materials, such as single, binary or ternary doping. Nitrogen (N), boron (B) and phosphorus (P) heteroatoms-doped carbon materials have attracted much attention due to their low price and excellent catalytic activity [8–10]. At present, most doped carbon materials are sp2-bonded carbon, such as graphene and carbon black, while their cyclical stability is unsatisfactory due to oxidation in high potentials and in the presence of moisture. However, the core/shell structure electrocatalysts of sp2-bonded carbon coating of sp3-bonded carbon types (nano-diamond or nano-SiC, etc.) exhibited better durability than sp2-bonded carbon materials as shown in previous studies [ 11,12 ]. This was attributed to the fact that the sp3-bonded carbon types are highly resistant to electrochemical corrosion. The graphitization of sp3-bonded carbon types is an effective way to synthesize the core/shell structure electrocatalysts [ 13,14 ]. For example, nano-SiC heated in inert gas atmosphere will lead to the sublimation of Si atoms and the formation of graphitic carbon by the remaining C atoms [ 15 ]. Likewise, Wataru et al. [ 16 ] extended the study from SiC to nano-B4C, which also have high thermal and chemical stability. The most important is that the decomposition of B4C makes the sublimation of atomic B to form the B-doped carbon layer on the surface of B4C (B-C/B4C) [ 16 ]. However, it is difficult to control the decomposition of B4C, while the process requires a very high decomposition temperature [ 17 ]. Then, the transition metal oxides have been put forward to solve the problem, which can reduce the decomposition temperature and promote the graphitization of sp3-bonded carbon types [ 18,19 ]. Herein, TiO2 was deposited on the surface of nano-B4C, denoted as TiO2/B4C. The TiO2 nanoparticles promoted then the graphitization of B4C during the pyrolysis process. Finally, TiO2-modified boron self-doped carbon/nano-B4C (TiO2/B-C/B4C) was created as an efficient bifunctional catalyst for the ORR and OER. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of the electrocatalysts Nano-B4C particles with a size of ~ 50 nm were purchased from Hefei Kaier Nanometer Energy & Technology Co. (China) and which were fabricated by plasma arc in air. Titanyl sulfate (19.6 mg) was weighed and added to sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solution (100 ml, 0.5 mM) in a 200 ml beaker. After obtaining the clarification of solution, the nano-B4C powder (100 mg) was put into the beaker and subjected to ultrasound stirring for 20 min to obtain a homogeneous suspension, then put into a 250 ml beaker. Next, the mixture was placed into a microwave oven and heated for 30 s at 100 W repeating 6 times. Finally, the sample was dried in an oven and the powder obtained consisted of TiO2 loaded on the B4C (TiO2/B4C). The sample above, which has been obtained by the microwave method, was heat treated at 700 °C in a vacuum for 3 h. The TiO2/B-C/B4C was finally obtained as the bifunctional electrocatalyst. In addition, a microwave-assisted reduction method was used to obtain 20 wt% Pt/C electrocatalyst. First, 20 mg carbon black (Vulcan XC- 72, Cabot Co.) was mixed with 0.5 ml hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6·6H2O, 50 mM) solution and 30 ml ethylene glycol in a 100 ml beaker and ultrasonicated for 30 min. Then, the beaker was irradiated in the microwave oven for 60 s at 800 W. The obtained powder was washed with acetone and deionized water two times, respectively. And the as-prepared solid product was dried at 100 °C for 24 h in a vacuum oven. The synthesis process of RuO2 was as follows: 5 ml of ruthenium precursor (RuCl3 ·nH2O, [Ru] = 37.0 wt%, 50 mM) and 100 ml deionized water was stirred and heated in water bath at 100 °C for 10 min. Then, 1 ml potassium hydroxide (KOH, 1 M) was added into the above solution and stirred for another 45 min. The suspension was centrifuged and washed by deionized water for three times and dried at 80 °C for 5 h, leading to the precipitation of Ru(OH)2. Finally, Ru(OH)2 was heated under air at 300 °C for 3 h to obtain the RuO2 electrocatalyst. 2.2 Electrochemical measurements All the electrochemical measurements were conducted using a CHI660A electrochemistry analyzer and performed on a rotating disk electrode (RDE) with a typical three-electrode cell system. These electrochemical measurements include cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The carbon rod and Hg/HgO electrode were used as a counter and reference electrode, respectively. The relationship: E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Hg/HgO) + 0.098 V + (0.0591 V) pH, was used to express all the experimental results of the voltage. The working electrode was obtained as follows: 5 mg electrocatalyst was mixed with 0.2 ml N,N-dimethylformamide solution. The suspension (15 μl) was applied to the surface of the RDE (0.19625 cm2), resulting in a catalyst loading of 1.91 mg cm−2. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characteristics of the TiO2/B-C/B4C electrocatalyst In order to characterize the crystalline structure of the electrocatalysts, the powder XRD patterns of pristine B4C, TiO2/B4C and TiO2/B-C/B4C are illustrated in Fig. S1. The peaks at ~ 35.0° and 37.8° can be indexed to the crystalline facets (104) and (021) of B4C, respectively. The diffraction peak at 27.8° is due to the (310) crystal face of B2O3 [ 20 ]. After microwave process treatment, the amorphous TiO2 should be formed on the surface of B4C and a large amount of B2O3 was removed (reaction equations as shown in Electronic Supporting Information, ESI). Thus, the diffraction peaks of B2O3 in TiO2/B4C had disappeared. Nevertheless, TiO2 phase in TiO2/B-C/B4C was formed after heated at 700 °C for 3 h. The typical diffraction peaks at ~ 27.4, 36.1, 39.2, 41.2, 43.9, 54.2, 56.5, 62.7, 64.0, 69.0 and 69.8° of TiO2 represent the (110), (101), (200), (111), (210), (211), (220), (002), (310), (301) and (112) planes of TiO2 (rutile). The morphology of the samples is shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S2. In Fig. S2a, pristine nano-B4C average particle size was ~ 50 nm. As can be seen from Fig. S2b, the HRTEM image of nano-B4C showed that pristine nano-B4C particles were coated with a layer of graphite carbon, which may come from the production process of original nano-B4C powders. For electrocatalysts, the existence of nanostructured carbon layers can effectively improve the electron conduction of the sample. Following the heat treatment, substantial strips of carbon were observed in Fig. 1a, which can be attributed to the pyrolysis of B4C. During the process of pyrolysis, B atoms escaped and the residual C atoms have been rearranged to form carbon layers. Part of carbon layers were formed on the surface of B4C, and part of thickened carbon layers cracked into strips, which can be denoted as carbon strips and have been carefully discussed in our previous work [ 21 ]. Generally, the pyrolysis of B4C would require a very high temperature, but it can be achieved at 550 °C because of the synergistic effect between B4C and TiO2 [ 22 ]. The particle size distribution of TiO2 (Fig. 1a) showed that the size of the TiO2 nanoparticles is 7–21 nm, which is the largest in the 13–15 nm range. In addition, the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern indicated the existence of rutile TiO2. In line with the diffraction ring radius, crystal lattice spacing was 0.324 nm corresponding to TiO2 (110) plane. The HRTEM images of TiO2/B-C/B4C shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. S2c indicate the relationship between the TiO2 and carbon layers, in which TiO2 nanoparticles were loaded on the B4C@carbon layers (core@shell) and carbon strips. In order to further investigate the surface chemical state of TiO2/B-C/B4C, we have conducted an XPS analysis. Typical photoelectron peaks of B 1 s, C 1 s, Ti 2p and O 1 s appeared at the corresponding binding energies 194.7, 284.8, 460.1 and 534.0 eV as shown in Fig. S3a. As shown in Fig. 2a, the B 1 s XPS spectrum exhibits four typical asymmetrical broad peaks, including the BB chemical bonding in B4C (188.2 eV), and BC chemical bond in BC3 moieties (189.4 eV), indicating B-doping in carbon layers [ 23 ]. In the range of 191.0–196.0 eV, the former peak at 193.8 eV could be due to the B2O3 structure on the TiO2 surface, and the later peak at 195.5 eV should be attributed to substitute B, which might replace oxygen or titanium. The B 1 s XPS spectrum could be used to prove the presence of boron-doped TiO2 [ 24 ]. However, the catalytic reaction mechanism for the substitute B is still controversial. In Fig. S3b, 283.1, 284.8 and 286.6 eV of the C 1 s XPS spectrum expressed the CB, CC and CO, respectively. Among them, the CB bonding possibly came from B substitutionally incorporated in carbon, while the 284.8 eV for CC was used to normalize the absolute binding energies, which was the amorphous carbon. The XPS spectrum of Ti 2p (Fig. 3b) exist in two characteristic peaks at 460.1 and 465.7 eV, expressing Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 for the pure TiO2, respectively [ 25 ]. XPS signals of O 1 s (Fig. S3c) were observed at binding energies at around 532.8, 534.1 and 535.7 eV. Among the three, the binding energy of 532.8 eV corresponds to the OB of B2O3 [ 26 ]. The OC binding energies at 534.1 and 535.7 eV are due to adsorbed water molecules on the surface of carbon [ 27 ]. Furthermore, elemental content of TiO2/B-C/B4C electrocatalyst was also characterized by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and atomic and mass ratios are shown in Fig. S3d. 3.2 Electrochemical activity performance Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were obtained on TiO2/B-C/B4C in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH from 100 to 2500 rpm (Fig. S4a). The electron transfer number per oxygen molecule (n) for ORR was determined from the LSV curves, according to the Koutechy-Levich (K-L) equation as shown in the ESI. The K-L plots (inset of Fig. S4a) show linear relationships from the slope of which n can be determined. The latter parameter was estimated to be 3.9 for the TiO2/B-C/B4C electrocatalyst, suggesting a four-electron pathway for ORR, like the Pt/C electrodes. The LSV curves (Fig. 3a) of B4C, TiO2/B4C, TiO2/B-C/B4C and Pt/C (20 wt%) were evaluated at 1600 rpm in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. It can be clearly seen that the positive onset potential (Eonset) and half-wave potential (E1/2) of TiO2/B-C/B4C was 0.92 V and 0.77 V, respectively, which is close to Pt/C (Eonset = 0.92 V and E1/2 = 0.78 V). Furthermore, the limiting current of TiO2/B-C/B4C was much larger than that of TiO2/B4C and B4C, which should be contributed to the B-doped carbon layer and TiO2. Meanwhile, the TiO2/B-C/B4C have better ORR catalytic activity than B-doped carbon materials [ 17,28,29 ]. Therefore, not only BC can perform ORR catalysis, but B-doped TiO2 also plays an important role. The non-impurity-doped B atoms may change the electronic structure of TiO2 and improve the ORR catalytic activity of TiO2. The Tafel plots of TiO2/B-C/B4C and Pt/C electrocatalysts are given in Fig. S4b, which were derived from Fig. 3a. The mass transfer-corrected jk is given by the following Eq. (1) [ 30 ]: (1) j k = j ⋅ j d j d − j where j is the actual current density (mA cm−2) measured and j d is the kinetic current density (mA cm−2). Results showed that the Tafel slopes were − 65 mV·dec−1 at low overpotential and − 115 mV dec−1 at high overpotential for the Pt/C, whereas the Tafel slopes of TiO2/B-C/B4C were − 65 and − 128 mV·dec−1, respectively. These results indicate a similar reaction mechanism between Pt/C and TiO2/B-C/B4C electrocatalysts. To further study the bifunctional catalytic performance of TiO2/B-C/B4C electrocatalyst, we have tested TiO2/B-C/B4C, RuO2 and Pt/C in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. As revealed in Fig. 3b, TiO2/B-C/B4C exhibits a negative Eonset and larger current density compared to RuO2 and Pt/C electrocatalysts. The E10,OER (potential being taken at a current density of 10 mA cm−2) was found to be 1.54 V with a low overpotential of 0.31 V [ 31 ]. Moreover, the OER kinetics of TiO2/B-C/B4C, RuO2 and Pt/C was further evaluated using the Tafel slope. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3b, the obtained Tafel slopes were approximately 61, 83 and 219 mV dec−1 for TiO2/B-C/B4C, RuO2 and Pt/C, respectively. Notably, the Tafel slope of TiO2/B-C/B4C is comparable to that of RuO2 [ 32 ]. In addition, the ORR/OER performance of TiO2/B-C/B4C was compared with similar catalysts and results are listed in Table 1 . It is shown that higher ORR and OER performances are exhibited by the present electrocatalyst. Thus, the TiO2/B-C/B4C catalyst with good ORR/OER activity can be potentially used in unitized regenerative fuel cells in new generation energy-storage systems. 4 Conclusions We have developed a TiO2/B-C/B4C bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR and OER by a microwave method, in which doped boron atoms were provided via the pyrolysis of B4C itself at 700 °C. The prepared TiO2/B-C/B4C catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity toward ORR and OER, which was comparable with that of Pt/C and RuO2 catalyst, respectively. Most importantly, the present work provided a simple and easy method for synthesizing a B-doped electrocatalyst.
