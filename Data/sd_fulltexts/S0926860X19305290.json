Graphical abstract The catalytic toluene hydrogenation over Ni/SiO2 was carried out using H2 or a H2/H2O mixture. The toluene conversion and MCH selectivity were evaluated under partial steam pressures 0−10 kPa, at H2/toluene molar ratios 1–5, and at temperatures 393−453 K. In the absence of steam, toluene conversion increased with increasing H2 partial pressure, and the MCH selectivity decreased with increasing temperature. In the presence of steam, the toluene conversion showed near-constant activities over the entire range of steam partial pressures, and the MCH selectivity increased with increasing steam partial pressure. This result indicated that the addition of steam inhibited byproduct formation. To clarify the effects of steam on the side-reaction, the byproducts composition was analyzed using a gas chromatograph. The results showed that the addition of steam inhibited demethylation, the ring-opening reaction of MCH, the disproportionation of toluene, and isomerization to convert six-membered ring compounds into five-membered ring compounds. Keywords Toluene hydrogenation Nickel catalyst Low-grade hydrogen Methylcyclohexane Hydrogen carrier 1 Introduction Hydrogen (H2) storage using liquid organic hydride is important to the utilization of renewable electricity generated from wind, solar, and hydropower [1–4]. Methylcyclohexane (C7H14, MCH) is one of the candidates for chemical H2 storage materials [1–4]. MCH can store H2 via toluene (C7H8) hydrogenation: (1) C7H8 + 3H2 → C7H14 – 205 kJ mol−1. This reaction has been studied extensively in the petrochemical industry, and the infrastructure for MCH synthesis and transportation has been established [2]. MCH also has relatively high volumetric and gravimetric H2 densities (47 kg-H2 m−3 and 6.1 wt% respectively), good transportability, and relatively low toxicity [2,4]. The Fukushima Renewable Energy Institute, AIST (FREA) has demonstrated a pilot-scale toluene hydrogenation system in which a 150-kW-class alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) system has been installed to generate renewable H2 [5]. The demonstration system can utilize a power input that fluctuates with time to generate H2, which simulates the surplus energy of renewable energy sources [5]. Kojima et al. [5] reported that the H2 production rate was highly synchronized with power input fluctuations and relatively short time delay. Although it has been reported that AWE efficiency decreases with increased input current frequency [8,10,11], AWE shows second-order response fluctuation in input power [8,9]. To achieve steady operation of the hydrogenation reactor, the toluene hydrogenation system needs a buffer tank (and a H2 compressor) or batteries to absorb the fluctuation of H2 or surplus energy, yet this can increase the capital cost of the system. Therefore, we believe that directly providing fluctuating H2 from AWE to the reactor is important to utilize renewable H2 effectively. Although the purity of H2 produced by AWE is generally lower than that produced using polymer-electrode electrolysis cells (PEECs) and solid-oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) due to its diaphragm, AWE is cost-effective and well-established compared to PEFCs and SOECs [6,7]. Hence it is important to evaluate the effects of trace impurities from AWE on toluene hydrogenation. Hydrogen generated on the cathode contains trace oxygen and is saturated with steam at the AWE operating temperature (generally 323–353 K) [6,7,34,35]. Hydrogen from AWE contains alkaline mist, e.g., KOH and NaOH, and a water scrubber removes the alkaline mist. If the water scrubber works at ambient temperature (298 K), the alkaline-free H2 contains steam with a partial pressure of 3 kPa. The trace oxygen can be removed by a metal-loaded catalyst packed in a toluene hydrogenation reactor. Steam has been reported to cause the oxidative demethylation of toluene over a Ni catalyst [36,37], as described by the following equations: (2) C6H5−CH3 + H2O → C6H6 + 2H2 +CO, (3) C6H5−CH3 + 2H2O → C6H6 + 3H2 +CO2. Moreover, steam can also cause oxidation of the Ni surface, which leads to catalytic deactivation. However, there are only a few reports of toluene hydrogenation in the presence of trace steam and the effects of the partial pressure of steam on catalytic activity. Practical AWE systems include a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) or temperature swing adsorption (TSA) process to remove the trace steam from H2 [6,7]. However, when the energy input of the AWE fluctuates, the dew-point of the purified hydrogen can fluctuate due to the steam flow rate exceeding the PSA or TSA capacity. To generate pure H2 using a fluctuating power input, it is necessary to load a great deal of adsorbent, or extend the AWE cycle time (the period from adsorption to desorption). This overloading seems to lead to higher capital expenditure for the AWE system. Therefore, it is important to estimate the effects of steam on the toluene hydrogenation process and determine an acceptable partial pressure of steam. The toluene hydrogenation reaction can be catalyzed by using Pt [2,12–20,30], Ru [21], Ir [22], and Ni [23–31]. Pt-loaded catalysts exhibit the highest activity [2], while Ni catalysts are the most cost-effective. As reported by Lindfors et al. [23], Ni catalysts exhibit high activity for excess H2 conditions with H2/toluene ratios greater than 3. In contrast, the activity drastically declines at H2/toluene ratios below 3. The result suggests that a H2/toluene ratio below 3 is not favorable for toluene hydrogenation. On the other hand, when the supply of surplus renewable energy fluctuates on a time scale of seconds, the toluene evaporator is not expected to exhibit an equivalent time-response. In other words, for the usage of renewable hydrogen, we should consider the situation in which the H2/toluene ratio will drop below 3. Therefore, it is important to estimate the catalytic activity of Ni catalysts against a wide range of H2 partial pressures, including H2/toluene ratios below 3. Nickel catalysts are active for CC bond cleavage. Grenoble [32] reported the catalytic activities of group VIIB and VIII metals for toluene hydrodealkylation via the reaction shown in the following equation: (4) C6H5−CH3 + H2 → C6H6 + CH4. They reported that the catalytic activity of the evaluated metals follows the order Ni > Rh > Ir > Os > Ru > Pt > Pd > Re [32]. The side reactions in toluene hydrogenation using Ni-loaded catalysts have also been studied [25,30,33]. Cui et al. [33] investigated the iterative utilization of MCH (up to 10 cycles) with bench-scale toluene hydrogenation and MCH dehydrogenation reactors to demonstrate their practical use. The resulting data showed the byproduct formation and accumulation behavior for each processing cycle. To our knowledge, there is no information on the effects of fluctuating H2 input on toluene hydrogenation. In the present study, we aimed to acquire the fundamental knowledge needed for the continued development of catalysts with applications to fluctuating H2 feed systems. The toluene hydrogenation activity of a commercial Ni catalyst in a wide range of H2/toluene molar ratios was measured to understand the behavior of not only main product formation, but also byproduct formation under operation of the fluctuating H2 supply. The formation of byproducts during hydrogenation was analyzed in detail. Furthermore, toluene hydrogenation was conducted using H2O-containing H2 (hereafter referred to as wet-H2) to evaluate the effects of steam on the catalytic activity. 2 Experimental The toluene hydrogenation activity of a stabilized Ni catalyst (BASF SE, Ni5256) with or without the addition of H2O vapor was measured in a packed-bed reactor system at ambient pressure, and 3 g of catalyst was set in the reactor. Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the packed-bed reactor. A 12.7 mm (1/8 inch) diameter cylinder-shaped industrial catalyst containing 57 wt% Ni was used. The specifications of the catalyst are summarized in Table 1 . The catalyst pellets were packed in a 1/2-inch-diameter stainless steel tube. A K-type thermocouple was inserted into the bed to monitor the bed temperature. The reactor was heated by using an electric furnace. The flow rates of the reactants (H2 and toluene) and the inert gas (N2) were controlled using pre-calibrated mass flow controllers. The flow rate of deionized water was controlled using a syringe pump. Liquid toluene and water were fed into an evaporator before the reactor to provide the feed of the toluene-steam mixture to the catalyst bed. The evaporator consisted of a 1/2-inch-diameter stainless steel tube, in which ∼1-mm-diameter stainless steel spheres were packed. The temperature of the stainless sphere bed was monitored using a K-type thermocouple and was maintained at 423 K using an electric heater. The exhaust gases from the catalyst bed were chilled at 293 K to recover liquid toluene, MCH, and byproducts. The samples were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent Technology Inc., GC system 7890A) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a DB-1 (dimethylpolysiloxane) column. The catalyst packed in the reactor was pre-reduced in H2 flow at 473 K for an hour [31]. A 0.15 g min−1 flow of toluene (JUNSEI Chemical co. ltd., Guaranteed Reagent, 99.5 %) was supplied to the catalyst bed. Hydrogen of grade 99.999995 vol% (Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation, G1-H2) was supplied at 40.4–201.8 mL min−1, which corresponded to a H2/toluene molar ratio from 1 to 5 (the stoichiometric ratio was 3, as described in Eq. 1). In order to evaluate the effects of steam on the catalytic activity, deionized water was supplied at a rate ranging from 0.4 to 18.6 mg min−1, corresponding to steam partial pressures of 1–10 kPa. The toluene conversion was calculated using the following equation: (5) (Toluene conversion %) = (1 - XToluene) × 100 where XToluene is the molar ratio of toluene in the recovered products. Equilibrium toluene conversion was also calculated by HSC chemistry 7 (Calculation of Equilibrium Composition ver. 7.10). The MCH selectivity was calculated using the following equation: (6) (MCH selectivity %) = [XMCH / (1 - XToluene)] × 100. The byproducts were categorized into five groups: demethylated compounds, ring-opened compounds, six-membered ring compounds (excluding benzene and cyclohexane), five-membered ring compounds, and dimerized compounds. The respective selectivity for these byproducts was calculated using the following equation: (7) (Byproducts selectivity %) = XByproducts / [ξ(1 - XToluene)] × 100 where ξ is the number of toluene molecules consumed to produce the product molecule. For the dimerized compounds, ξ = 2, while for the other compounds, ξ = 1. To ensure accuracy, byproduct selectivity was calculated for compounds with concentration of more than 0.01 mol%. Further, we distinguished these byproduct groups by the kind of hydrogen carrier: six-membered ring compounds, unusable byproducts; ring-opened compounds and five-membered ring compounds, toxic or inhibitor byproducts; demethylated and dimerized compounds. In order to estimate the surface acidic properties of the Ni catalyst with and without steam, temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) was performed. A total of 0.1 g of the as-prepared catalyst was packed in a quartz tube with an inner diameter of 6 mm and pre-reduced using 50 mL min−1 of pure H2 at 473 K for an hour. Then, 200 mL min−1 of dry or humidified argon (Ar, 99.9999 % purity, Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation, G1-Ar) gas was flowed into the quartz tube at 298 K, followed by 100 mL min−1 of an Ar/NH3 mixture (argon-balanced NH3 standard gas). The partial pressures of H2O and NH3 in Ar were 1 vol%, and the Ar was humidified with deionized water using a bubbler. After the quartz tube was purged with 100 mL min−1 of Ar for 10 min, the sample with adsorbed NH3 and H2O was heated from 298 to 873 K using an electric heater with an Ar flow rate of 100 mL min-1 and a heating rate of 3 K min−1. The effluent gas was analyzed by using a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FT-IR) equipped with a multi-reflection gas cell. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Toluene hydrogenation at various H2/toluene ratios To determine the activity of the catalyst under a fluctuating supply of H2, the toluene conversion and MCH selectivity at different H2/toluene ratios were evaluated at temperatures from 393 to 453 K. Fig. 2 shows the observed and equilibrium toluene conversion at H2/toluene ratios of 1–5. The catalyst exhibited higher activity at lower temperatures and higher H2/toluene ratios. Equilibrium toluene conversion also decrease as temperature increased. At 393 K and H2/toluene ratios > 3.5, ∼100 % toluene conversion was achieved. The MCH selectivity calculated using Eq. 6 is shown as a function of the H2/toluene ratio and temperature in Fig. 3 . MCH selectivity at 393 K seems to decrease. The composition of the byproducts is summarized in Fig. 4 , in which the vertical axis represents the selectivity for each byproduct group, as calculated using Eq. 7. Table 2 lists the compounds detected by GC-FID. Although the MCH selectivity was relatively stable at different H2/toluene ratios (see Fig. 3), the selectivity for five-membered ring compounds increased with increasing H2/toluene ratio; in contrast, the selectivity for the six-membered ring compounds decreased with increasing H2/toluene ratio (see Fig. 4). The ratio of ring-opened and dimerized products remained nearly constant. From Fig. 4(a) and (b), it can be seen that the demethylation of toluene and ring-opening selectivities were almost independent of the H2/toluene ratio; however, these reactions increased probably due to an increase in the CC bond cleavage rate over the Ni surface with increasing temperature [32]. This result agrees with the data reported by Masalska [25]. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 4(c), the selectivity toward the six-membered ring compounds decreased with increasing H2/toluene ratio. Possible pathways to six-membered ring compounds, such as xylenes, are the disproportionation reaction (Eq. 8) and the methylation of toluene, in which the methyl group is derived from the cracking of aromatic compounds [25]. (8) 2C7H8 → C6H6 + C8H10. If disproportionation is dominant, the trend in the graph of six-membered ring compounds will be similar to that of the demethylated compounds. Since their trend lines were different (Fig. 4 (a) and (c)), this means the disproportionation reaction to form benzene and six membered ring compounds was only a minor pathway. For the formation of five-membered ring compounds, Upare et al. [38] reported the mechanism of MCH isomerization over the Ni/SiO2 catalyst, and suggested that MCH was converted to dimethyl cyclopentane and ethyl cyclopentane at the acid sites on SiO2, followed by the ring-opening of these products to form methylhexane or heptane. In this study, dimethyl cyclopentane (a C7 compound) was detected; thus, MCH was likely a precursor of dimethyl cyclopentane. As listed in Table 2, methyl cyclopentane (a C6 compound) and ethyl methylcyclopentane (a C8 compound) were also detected. These byproducts might be formed from a similar reaction mechanism as for dimethyl cyclopentane formation [25]. To find appropriate operation conditions regarding the temperature and the H2/toluene ratio, the results of the activity tests were compared again. In the range 393–453 K, a favorable temperature was 393 K, because the highest toluene conversion and MCH selectivity and lowest byproducts formation were obtained. For discussion of the appropriate H2/toluene ratio, we compared conversion and selectivity at 393 K. When the H2/toluene ratio was lower than 3, a higher MCH selectivity was obtained. Also, there were fewer unusable and toxic byproducts, and more hydrogen carrier byproducts, than for a H2/toluene ratio above 3. On the other hand, these conditions can lead to the remainder of unreacted toluene. Therefore, the favorable H2/toluene ratios were stoichiometric or below stoichiometry. 3.2 Effect of steam on the catalytic activity Toluene hydrogenation was carried out using wet-hydrogen to determine the effect of steam on the catalytic activity of Ni. Figs. 5 and 6 show the toluene conversion and MCH selectivity as a function of the steam partial pressure for H2/toluene ratios of 1–5 at temperatures from 393 to 453 K. The conversion was relatively constant at the different steam partial pressures at all of the H2/toluene ratios and temperature conditions (Fig. 5). On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 6, the MCH selectivity increased with increasing steam partial pressure. This positive effect of steam was observed most clearly at higher temperatures and lower H2/toluene ratios. Even in the presence of H2O, toluene conversion and MCH selectivity at 393 K were higher than those at other temperatures. To clarify the details of the side-reaction inhibition effect of steam, the selectivity for each byproduct group under different steam partial pressures was evaluated using a H2/toluene ratio of 3 (Fig. 7 ). The decrease in the selectivity for demethylated compounds was a major cause of the increase in MCH selectivity. Although steam addition can potentially lead to oxidative demethylation, as described in Eq. 3 and 4 [36,37], this reaction was not dominant in this work. It was believed that this was due to the relatively low temperature and steam partial pressure used in this study. Masalska [25] reported the effect of the metal/Brønsted-acid site ratio on MCH selectivity in toluene hydrogenation over Ni-loaded ZSM-5 catalysts, and Brønsted acid sites and higher temperature were suggested to enhance activity for side-reactions such as dehydrogenation, cracking, and disproportionation of toluene. Upare et al. [38] also reported the reaction pathway of the MCH ring-opening reaction and isomerization over Ni, as well as on the acid sites of SiO2, which were suggested to be involved in the isomerization of MCH and ring-opening of the isomers. To confirm the suppression effect of steam addition on byproducts formation, NH3-TPD measurements were conducted to assess the contribution of the acid sites. Fig. 8 shows the NH3-TPD profile with or without steam during pretreatment. Both profiles exhibited a peak at around 350 K. The desorption amounts of NH3 with and without wet-Ar pretreatment were 4.9 and 5.4 mol gcat −1, respectively. From these results, steam addition appears to have little influence on the acidic property of the surface of Ni/SiO2. Considering these results, in the presence of water vapor, the competitive adsorption of H2O and toluene might decrease toluene coverage, resulting in a decrease in the surface residence time of toluene. If toluene molecules reside on the catalyst surface for a shorter time, a greater number of molecules desorb before the side-reactions are initiated. According to past research on the photocatalytic decomposition of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), aromatic compounds and water vapor are competitively adsorbed on the solid surface, thereby decreasing the VOCs adsorption amount at higher steam partial pressures. The present study clarified the robustness of the Ni catalyst against H2O at temperatures below 453 K and the positive effect of steam addition on MCH selectivity. Although current AWE systems utilize H2 purification, such as PSA and TSA to remove trace H2O [6,7], our data suggests that wet-H2 can be positive for toluene hydrogenation, which would decrease the exergy loss during the gas-liquid separation process. When MCH is synthesized using a H2/H2O mixture, the H2O must be collected in an MCH recovery tank. The water phase is expected to form under an oil (MCH) phase, which would allow the water phase to be removed from the tank by an extraction operation. 4 Conclusion Toluene hydrogenation was carried out using dry- and wet-H2 in a packed reactor with an industrial Ni/SiO2 catalyst. When MCH was synthesized from toluene using dry-H2, a higher H2/toluene ratio inhibited the disproportionation of toluene, while higher temperatures accelerated the demethylation reaction, disproportionation reaction, isomerization reaction, and ring-opening reaction (or cracking) of MCH. The dimerization selectivity showed only weak correlation with the H2/toluene ratio and temperature under the conditions tested. The toluene conversion remained near-constant at steam partial pressures ranging from 0 to 10 kPa in the temperature range from 393 to 453 K, while the MCH selectivity increased with increasing steam partial pressure. The selectivity for demethylated compounds notably decreased with increasing steam partial pressure. It was hypothesized that Brønsted acid sites on the surface of the support were occupied by H2O or hydroxyl groups generated from dissociative H2O adsorption. NH3-TPD measurements were conducted to investigate the acid sites on the Ni/SiO2; prior to TPD, the catalyst was exposed to wet- or dry-Ar at 298 K. The NH3-TPD profiles indicated that the wet-gas treatment decreased the number of acid sites, while the acid strength was not affected. These results might suggest that the occupation of the acid sites on Ni/SiO2 by steam resulted in lesser number of reaction sites available for catalyzing side-reactions. References [1] M.
