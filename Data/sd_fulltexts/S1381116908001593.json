Keywords Scandium Olefin polymerization Constrained geometry catalysts Non-cyclopentadienyl catalysts 1 Introduction Group 4 metal complexes such as titanocenes and zirconocenes are highly active catalysts in homogeneous olefin polymerization [1]. However, it has been observed that the use of ansa-dicyclopentadienyl ligands can sometimes lead to a reduction of the electrophilicity of the metal centers and to create steric hindrance in the polymerization of higher α-olefins. In the last few years, to reduce both steric and electronic problems, research has been directed also toward the synthesis of new mono-cyclopentadienyl (CGC) and cyclopentadienyl-free derivatives. Phenoxyimine Group 4 metal complexes, developed by Fujita et al., have shown ethylene polymerization activities comparable or higher than those of metallocenes and in some cases α-olefin stereospecific polymerization [2]. Polyolefins can be also obtained in the presence of a number of neutral and cationic alkyl complexes of the rare-earth metals, stabilized by both cyclopentadienyl- and non-cyclopentadienyl ancillary ligands [3] and the expected electrophilicity of Group 3 metals makes them attractive as homogeneous catalysts for Ziegler–Natta polymerization. Our recent research interest in the field of olefin polymerization has mainly been devoted to Group 3 and Lanthanides Constrained Geometry Catalysts [4] and Group 4 complexes with tridentate [N,N,O]-donor-set ancillary ligands [5]. In this paper we report the synthesis of three new Sc(III) chloro-complexes with anionic ansa-monocyclopentadienyl-imino-pyridine (1), quinolinephenoxyimine (2) and quinolinephenoxyamine (3) ancillary ligands, together with the results of a comparative catalytic behavior of these new species towards olefin polymerization. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and methods All inorganic manipulations were carried out under oxygen- and moisture-free atmosphere in a Braun MB 200 G-II glove-box. All reaction solvents were thoroughly deoxygenated and dehydrated under argon by refluxing over suitable drying agents, while NMR solvents were kept in the dark over molecular sieves. The salt ScCl3 (Strem) was used as received, like 2,6-dihydroxymethyl-pyridine, 8-aminoquinoline and 3-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (Aldrich). Cyclopentadiene was obtained by cracking of dicyclopentadiene (Aldrich). Potassium cyclopentadienide was obtained by reacting freshly distilled cyclopentadiene with a stoichiometric amount of potassium tert-butoxide (Aldrich) in hexane. 2,6-Diisopropylaniline (Aldrich) was purified by reaction with a stoichiometic amount of methanesulphonic acid (Aldrich) in n-hexane. The white precipitate formed was collected, washed with n-hexane and dried in vacuo. Subsequently, the methanesulphonate salt was allowed to react with NaHCO3 in water. 2,6-Diisopropylaniline was recovered by extraction with diethylether and, once dried the organic solution over anhydrous MgSO4, the solvent was eliminated under reduced pressure to afford the pure aniline, which was stored in the dark. The neutral ligand NNCpH, which is a tautomeric mixture of (6-cyclopenta-1,3-dienylmethyl-pyridin-2-ylmethylene)-(2,6-diisopropyl-phenyl)-amine and (6-ciclopenta-1,4-dienylmethyl-pyridin-2-ylmethylene)-(2,6-diisopropyl-phenyl)-amine, was prepared following a reported procedure [4]. Also the synthesis of the ligand NNOH, 2-tert-butyl-6-[(quinolin-8-ylimino)methyl]phenol, has been recently published [5]. These ligands are depicted in Scheme 1 . The organometallic precursor Sc(CH2SiMe3)3·2THF was synthesized following the literature method [6]. All the polymerization operations were performed under nitrogen atmosphere by using conventional Schlenk-line techniques. Methylaluminoxane (10% in toluene, Witco) was used as a solid after distillation of solvent. Ethylene (>98%), 1,3-butadiene (>99%), Mg(Bu)2 were purchased from Aldrich, B(C6F5)3 was purchased from Boulder. 2.2 Ligands and complexes characterization Microanalyses were performed at the Istituto di Chimica Inorganica e delle Superfici, CNR, Padova. 1H NMR, 13C {1H} NMR, COSY, NOESY and 13C APT were recorded at 298K on a Bruker Avance 300 spectrometer operating at 300MHz (1H) and 75MHz (13C) and referred to internal tetramethylsilane. NMR deuterated solvents (CDCl3, CD2Cl2, THF-d 8) were purchased from Euriso-Top. Mass spectra (E.I., 70eV) were recorded on a Finnigan Trace GC–MS equipped with a probe controller for the sample direct inlet. 2.3 Polymers analysis The samples of polyethylenes for 13C NMR analysis were prepared by dissolving 40mg of polymer into tetrachloro-dideutero-ethane (0.5mL). The spectra were recorded at 100°C using hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS) as internal chemical shift reference. Samples of polybutadienes for 13C NMR spectra were prepared by dissolving polymer (20mg) into CDCl3 (0.5mL). The spectra were recorded at room temperature using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal chemical shift reference. The gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analyses of the samples were performed at 135°C by Waters instrument GPCV 2000 equipped with refractive index and viscosimeter detectors, using four PSS columns set consisting of 105, 104, 103, 102 Å (pore size)−10μm (particle size). o-Dichlorobenzene was the carrier solvent used with a flow rate of 1.0mL/min. The calibration curve was established with polystyrene standards. Differential scanning calorimetry analyses have been carried out on a DSC 2920 apparatus manufactured by TA Instruments, calibrated against an indium standard (T m =156.6°C), with heating scans from −10 to 200°C, at a 10°C/min heating rate, under a flowing nitrogen atmosphere. Specimens were sealed in aluminum pans. 2.4 Synthesis of 2-tert-butyl-6-[(quinolin-8-ylamino)methyl]phenol (NNHOH) A solution of NNOH (2.1g, 6.9mmol) in anhydrous THF (50mL) was cooled to −70°C, then a 1M solution of LiAlH4 in THF (6.9mL) was added drop-by-drop, keeping the temperature as constant as possible. The resulting solution was allowed to slowly reach room temperature (about 2h) and then maintained under stirring for further 4h. The reaction mixture was quenched with cold water (40mL) and THF was quite completely removed by evaporation under reduced pressure. The crude product was extracted with diethylether (3× 50mL) and the resulting organic fraction was dried over MgSO4. The solvent was then removed under reduced pressure and the resulting white solid was dissolved under stirring in a small amount of pentane (5mL). A white powder slowly started to separate and, after cooling overnight at −25°C, the white product was collected by filtration and washed with cold pentane (1.86g, 88% yield).

The reaction mixture was allowed to react 15min at −20°C, and used in the polymerization reactions. The reaction product is not stable at room temperature. 2.9 Polymerization Run 1–8. Polymerizations of ethylene were performed in a 250mL glass-autoclave introducing the amount of catalyst and cocatalyst dissolved in 125mL of toluene, as reported in Table 1 . The mixtures were fed with the monomer and kept under magnetic stirring over the runs. The polymerization mixtures were poured in acidified ethanol after venting the autoclave, then the polymers were recovered by filtration, washed with fresh ethanol and dried in vacuo at 60°C. Run 9. Polymerization of ethylene was performed in a 250mL glass-autoclave thermostatted at −20°C, introducing, in 25mL of cold toluene, the solution of 1 R . The mixture was fed with ethylene and kept under magnetic stirring over the run. The autoclave was vented and the polymerization mixture was poured in acidified ethanol. We did not obtain polymer. Run 10. Polymerization of ethylene was performed in a 250mL glass-autoclave thermostatted at −20°C, introducing the solution of 1 R and then 2.0×10−2 mol of MAO dissolved in 25mL of cold toluene. The mixture was fed with ethylene and kept under magnetic stirring over the run. The autoclave was vented and the polymer was recovered as usual. Runs 11–14. Polymerizations of 1,3-butadiene were performed by introducing 19mL of dry toluene and the cocatalysts into 100mL glass flasks equipped with magnetic stirrer. The flasks were cooled with liquid nitrogen and the inert gas was evacuated. 1.5g of 1,3-butadiene were condensed into the flasks, then the reactors were quickly thermostatted at the reaction temperature and polymerizations were started by injecting 1mL of toluene solution of scandium compounds. Introduction of a few amount of ethanol stopped the polymerizations, then the polymers were coagulated in an excess of acidified ethanol, washed several times with fresh ethanol and dried in vacuo at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis of NNHOH The compound NNOH has been also used as starting material for the synthesis of the new ligand NNHOH, 2-tert-butyl-6-((quinolin-8-ylamino)methyl)phenol, in order to compare catalytic behavior of scandium complexes having two isoelectronic ligands with different basicity, the scandium derivatives with the ligand NNOH and the corresponding form without the imine double bond. The neutral ligand was obtained in good yield by reducing at low temperature in THF the imine group of NNOH, as depicted in Scheme 2 . Elemental analysis (C, H, N) agrees with the proposed formulation. 1H COSY and NOESY experiments allowed the assignment of all the proton resonances of the 1H NMR spectrum. The 13C APT (attached-proton-test) NMR allowed to separate CH and quaternary aromatic carbons and to assign the CH2 and t Bu groups. Finally, the most meaningful signals of the mass spectrum corresponded to the molecular ion and the molecular ion after the loss of a methyl fragment from the tert-butyl group. 3.2 Synthesis of the complexes Scandium complexes 1, 2 and 3 were prepared following the same synthetic strategy, i.e. the deprotonation of the neutral ligands NNCpH, NNOH or NNHOH with a stoichiometric amount of potassium tert-butoxide, followed by the reaction of the anionic ancillary ligand obtained with ScCl3, as depicted in Scheme 3 . The 1H NMR of [ScCl2(NNCp)(THF)] (1) shows, downfield, the signals of the imine, the pyridine and the phenyl protons. The Cp protons appear as a pseudo-A2B2 spin system. The aliphatic region shows the coordinated THF molecule, the methylene and isopropyl protons: these last ones are non-equivalent, since the coordination to the metal fragment does not allow the free rotation of the phenyl ring around the C(phenyl)-N(imine) bond. The MS spectrum of the complex shows the presence of a signal at 458 m/z assignable to the molecular ion after the loss of the coordinated THF molecule and a signal at 423 m/z assignable to the fragment formed by the loss of a chlorine atom from the previous ion. COSY and NOESY experiments allowed the complete assignment of all the protons of compound [ScCl2(NNO)(THF)] (2). Besides the aromatic protons (in the region 9.53−6.80), the multiplets due to the coordinated THF (δ =3.56 and 1.86ppm) and the tert-butyl singlet (δ =1.51ppm), a characteristic signal for this type of compounds is the downfield singlet at δ =9.01ppm, corresponding to the imine proton –CH=N– [5]. The MS spectrum of complex 2 shows, besides the molecular fragment after the loss of the coordinated THF molecule at 418 m/z, two additional signals at 403 m/z and 383 m/z assignable to the ions formed after the loss of a methyl fragment or a chlorine atom from the [M +−THF] + ion, respectively. A complete assignment of all 1H NMR signals was obtained also for compound 3, [ScCl2(NNHO)(THF)]. Besides the aromatic protons in the region 9.64–6.22, an interesting downfield signal is the slightly broad singlet at 6.49ppm, assignable to the NH proton. The 1H NMR shows also the THF signals (δ =3.72 and 1.87ppm) and the tert-butyl singlet at δ =1.42ppm. The –CH2– group appears as an AB spin system at δ =5.05ppm and δ =4.31ppm, with a 2 J HH coupling constant of 12.0Hz which is typical of geminal coupling. The non-equivalence of the two methylene protons is diagnostic of the coordination of the amine nitrogen atom to the metal center, which makes the sp3 N-atom of ancillary ligand chiral. The MS spectrum of complex 3 shows the molecular fragment after the loss of the coordinated THF molecule at 418 m/z. Moreover, a signal attributable to the loss of a –CH3 and a –H fragment from [M +−THF] + is present at 404 m/z; these two fragments probably derive from the t Bu and the –NH– groups of the NNHO ligand respectively. The reaction of a stoichiometric amount of Sc(CH2SiMe3)3·2THF and NNCpH at low temperature should afford the alkylated analogous of chloro-compound 1, [Sc(CH2SiMe3)2(NNCp)] (1 R ), by protonolysis of a Sc–C bond of the scandium precursor and coordination of the deprotonated ancillary ligand. Since the reaction product is unstable at room temperature, the reaction mixture was freshly prepared before the polymerization runs and kept at −20°C. The synthesis of this compound offers, however, the possibility to verify the eventual catalytic activity of a neutral scandium alkyl complex towards olefin polymerization. 3.3 Polymerization Cationic alkyl complex of Group 4 metals are the most common single-site olefin polymerization catalysts. Isoelectronic neutral alkyl complexes of Group 3 metals generally show much lower polymerization activity. One approach to increase the polymerization activity involves the generation of cationic alkyl species obtained by alkyl abstraction from neutral dialkyl or chloride complex by suitable activator. Thus, all synthesized compounds were tested in the polymerization of ethylene with methylaluminoxane (MAO) or Mg(Bu)2/B(C6F5)3 as cocatalysts. Scandium complexes 1, 1 R , 2 and 3 activated by MAO give linear polyethylene having high melting point (135°C), high molecular weight and narrow polydispersity, whereas activation of complexes by Mg(Bu)2/B(C6F5)3 do not produce a catalytically active species. Observing Tables 1–3 , polyethylenes obtained by scandium complex 1 and 1 R have M w >1×106, whereas complexes 2 and 3 produce polymers having M w >6×105. Probably, the high steric hindrance of NNCp, as well as NNO and NNHO anionic ligands could prevent the β hydrogen elimination, which represents, generally, the most relevant chain termination process. The narrow polydispersity is indicative of single site catalytic species. It is worth noting that high M w were frequently obtained performing ethylene polymerization by scandium complexes having bulky ligands [7]. Examining the polymerization results reported in Tables 1–3, it is possible to note that the catalyst based on scandium complex 1 is the most active. In fact, polymer yields are two hundred times higher than 3 and two thousand times higher than 2, in spite of the really longer reaction times used for 2- and 3-based catalytic systems, necessary to obtain easily analyzable quantities of polyethylene. This fact could be explained on considering the different electronic environments of the metal center due to different ligands. In fact, the electronic contribution of NNCp ligand is 10 electrons, whereas NNO and NNHO ligands contribute to stabilize the catalytic species only by six electrons. It is worth recalling that the polymerization reactions consist in the coordination of olefin to the metal followed by its insertion in the metal-polymeril σ-bond. The electronic remarkable unsaturation of scandium complexes with ligands NNO and NNHO, with respect to NNCp ligand, could on the one hand support the olefin coordination to the metal, whereas, on the other hand, generate a strong metal olefin π-bond and consequently a less reactive species in the insertion step. This hypothesis is able also to rationalize the different reactivity of catalysts based on complexes 2 and 3, respectively. In fact, the metal is bonded, in both cases, to pyridine nitrogen and alkoxide oxygen, and it is further bonded to imine nitrogen in the complex 2 and to amine nitrogen in the complex 3. Evidently lower basicity of imine group, with respect to amine group, produces a catalytic species having higher electrophilicity and consequently, a stronger metal olefin π-bond. Therefore, accordingly, kinetic of insertion step for a 2-based catalytic system could be less favored. Moreover, catalyst based on scandium complex 1 is much more active than analogous catalysts based on yttrium, samarium and neodymium [4]. This suggests that the catalytic activity of the cationic alkyl species in ethylene polymerization is strongly depended on the metal ion size. In Table 1 the polymerization results in the presence of 1 activated by different MAO/Sc mole ratios are reported. It is possible to observe that the amount of cocatalyst is a crucial factor for the catalyst activity. In fact, it increases with the increase of Al/Sc mole ratio. In Fig. 1 the data of runs performed in the presence of 1/MAO catalytic system are plotted and as one can see, the yield reaches a maximum for a mole ratio Al/Sc≈500 and subsequently it is almost constant. Table 3 reports the results obtained using [Sc(CH2SiMe3)2(NNCp)] (1 R ) as catalyst, that represents the alkylated form of complex 1. Run 9 and 10 were carried out at −20°C, because the alkyl derivative is instable at room temperature. Run 9 was performed without MAO, in order to estimate the catalytic activity of the neutral species. In these conditions scandium complex 1 R does not give polymer. In the same condition, but after activation with MAO (run 10), it instead yields linear polyethylene. This fact prove that the cationization of scandium complexes LScX2 effected by MAO to form [LSc-CH3]+[MAOX2]− ion pairs is necessary in order to obtain an active catalytic species (see Scheme 4 ). Scandium compounds 1–3 were also tested in the polymerization of butadiene (see Table 4 ). They produce polybutadiene prevailingly with 1,4–cis microstructure, but with low activity. Activation of complexes 1–3 was also carried out in the presence of Mg(Bu)2 and B(C6F5)3 but polymerizations of butadiene, as well as of ethylene, did not produce polymers. The different behavior of scandium complexes, in the presence of MAO or Mg(Bu)2 and B(C6F5)3 cocatalysts, depend on species generated by the activation reactions. In particular, the anion [MAOX2]− generated could be less coordinating than [B(Bu)(C6F5)3]− produced when the cocatalyst is the system Mg(Bu)2/B(C6F5)3 (see Scheme 4). A non-coordinating anion makes easier the coordination of the monomer on the cationic active species, thus allowing the polymerization reaction. 4 Conclusion In this paper the synthesis of three new scandium chloro-complexes with different donor sets has been reported and, on the basis of catalytic tests towards ethylene polymerization, the correlation between electron-donor ability of the ancillary ligands and catalytic activity of the corresponding complexes has been highlighted. It was concluded that the active catalytic species should be cationic alkyl derivatives formed by in situ reaction between precursors and cocatalysts and that the final activity in the experimental conditions described is strongly dependent upon the coordinating ability of the counter-anion formed. Finally, it was observed a low activity of the considered systems towards butadiene polymerization, even if in some cases a relatively good selectivity towards 1,4-cis-polybutadiene was achieved.
