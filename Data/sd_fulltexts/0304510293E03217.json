Slaa Department of Chemistry, Brunel University, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, UK (Received October 6, 1993; accepted December 7, 1993) Abstract Turnover frequencies (TOF) for hydrogenolysis of n-butane on Ru/A1203 catalysts, measured with a 10-fold excess of H2, depend on dispersion and on pretreatment. After a first high-temperature reduction at 753 K (HTR1), 1% Ru/A1203 showed high dispersion and moderate activity; oxidation at 623 K followed by reduction at 433 K caused dispersion to decrease, and rates and TOFs to increase. However, the magnitude and even the sign of the effects depended on the HZ pressure used, because the form of the rate dependence on HZ pressure changed significantly. Many of the discrepancies in the literature concerning particle size effects may originate in the use of different conditions for measuring rates and of different pretreatments. Alterations in the form of the dependence of rates and of product selectivities on HZ pressure suggest that \"structure sensitivity\" in these systems may in fact be due to variations in the strength of HZ chemisorption.

Introduction The basis for the dependence of catalytic activity upon the size of metallic particles in supported metal catalysts continues to excite interest. There is now ample evidence to show that reactions of alkanes with HZ exhibit \"structure-sensitivity\" with respect to both rates [ 1,2] and product selectivities [2] , but the interpretation of the observations is complicated by the tendency of alkanes to form unreactive \"carbonaceous residues\" [ 3 ] . This tendency * Corresponding author. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSD10304-5102(93)E0321-7 222 G.C. Bond, J.C. Slaa /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 221-228 is itself particle-size dependent, increasing with the size of the particle; it also increases with the number of carbon atoms in the alkane, and as the HZ/alkane ratio decreases. These factors are at least partly responsible for the wide variations in the responses of rate to change in particle size that have been reported [ 1,3 ] . In addition, there have been reports [4-6] that activity for hydrogenolysis of alkanes is enhanced, sometimes markedly, by an oxidative treatment followed by mild reduction; the phenomenon still awaits a convincing explanation. We have recently [7] exploited a technique, originally developed by Galvagno and his associates [ 8 ] , for minimising deactivation due to carbonaceous residues by operating with very short reaction pulses in the continuous-flow mode. The procedure allows us to obtain accurate kinetic information as the Hz/alkane ratio is altered, since unlike the conventional pulse-flow method the reaction is conducted with a specified and constant reactant ratio. Continuing the flow of H2 between reaction periods assists in maintaining the catalyst in a cleaner state than would otherwise be possible. We can thereby study rates and product selectivities in a range of HZ/alkane ratios that would normally be inaccessible because of deactivation. We now report our first results for the dependence of rates and product selectivities on HZ pressure in the reaction of n-butane with HZ on Ru/A120, catalysts having different dispersions. The high activity and relatively low tendency to deactivation makes this system particularly amenable to study. 2. Experimental Ru/A'Z03 catalysts were prepared by adsorption of Ru(acac)3 from toluene solution onto y-alumina (Rhone-Poulenc GFC-200), followed by decomposition in NZ (523 K, 1 h) and reduction in 10% H2/N2 (623 K, 1 h). After reduction, the catalysts contained either 1.0 wt.% (EC 1) or 4.0 (EC3) wt.% Ru. Hydrogenolysis was conducted at atmospheric pressure in a semi-automatic, continuousfiow apparatus [ 9 ] . The catalyst (ca. 0.200 g) was reduced in HZ (heating rate 10 K min-', 13 h at 753 K; pretreatment code HTR1). The composition of the standard reactant mixture was: n-butane, 0.071 atm; H2, 0.714 atm; N2, 0.215 atm; and the total flow-rate was 140 cm 3 min-'. Although Ru is known to be an ammonia synthesis catalyst, the presence of NZ in the reaction mixture had no effect on the rates and selectivities found at the relatively low temperatures and pressure used in our experiments. After a first series of kinetic measurements, the catalyst was oxidised (air, 623 K, 1 h) and reduced (Hz, 433 K, 1 h; pretreatment code O/LTR). After a second series of kinetic measurements, the high temperature reduction was repeated (HTR2), and the kinetics re-determined. Hydrogenolysis of n-butane can be treated as the successive reaction of adsorbed inter mediates (C * ) containing j carbon atoms (j = 2-4) together with a short-circuit from C4* to allow for fission of the central C-C bond [9,10]. Selectivity to the product having j carbon atoms, Sl, is defined in terms of the number of moles of that product formed divided by the number of moles of n-butane converted: G.C. Bond, JC. Slaa /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 221-228 223 S - Ci ' (c, + 2C2 + 3C3) /4 The splitting factor F gives the fraction of n-butane converted to ethane, and the fraction of product j desorbed rather than further cracked is given by Tj -kj'l (kj' +kj) where kj' is the apparent rate constant for desorption, and kj' that for cracking. Steady-state analysis of the reaction network leads to equations which at low conversion take the form (SZ/TZ) +S3 =1+F T3 =S3/(1 -F) These cannot be solved unless a value for TZ is assumed: we take it to be the same as the value of SZ in the reaction of propane under corresponding conditions. To study the dependence of the rates and selectivities on the partial pressure of H2, we have used a pulse method [ 1,8] by which a \"pulse\" of the reaction mixture (H2, alkane, and Nz) flowed through the catalyst bed for 1 min, at the end of which time a sample was taken for analysis. Between two pulses, the catalyst was cleansed by a gas mixture consisting of a high concentration of Hz in NZ, which flowed over the catalyst for 15 min. Then, 4 min before the next pulse, the flows of HZ and NZ were adjusted to the desired rates, and then the alkane flow was added to this mixture to start a new pulse. The partial pressure of nbutane was always 0.071 atm. HZ pressures were varied randomly. Reference measurements were carried out before and after those at the lowest H2 pressures, where the chance of deactivation is greatest; this gave a check on the degree of deactivation and a chance to correct for it by normalising rates to the second reference measurement. Such corrections were needed after HTR1 and HTR2, but not after O/LTR. 3. Results In our earlier extensive work with the Ru/Ti02 system [6], we adopted a schedule of pretreatments closely similar to those defined above as HTR1, O/LTR and HTR2, and found that these produced marked changes in activity, dispersion, TOF and in product selectivities. The results obtained on applying those pretreatments to the Ru/A1203 catalysts EC 1 and EC3 are summarised in Table 1. After HTR1, EC 1 is very highly dispersed, the mean particle size by TEM being 1.2 nm: with both catalysts, the O/LTR treatment gives a four- to five-fold decrease in dispersion, which is not changed further by HTR2. TEM after O/LTR showed that many Ru particles had even grown by a factor 10. The thermal cycling experiments show that under the conditions used the TOF values following the three pretreatments fall in the order O/LTR > HTR2 > HTR I with both catalysts. However, TOFs are not simply determined by dispersion, as comparison of the results obtained after O/LTR and HTR2 will show (Table 1), but, considering only the values found after an HTR, the trend is in the same sense as that observed previously [ 2] , namely, higher TOFs 224 G.C.

Dependence of the rate of n-butane hydrogenolysis on the H2 pressure for catalyst EC 1 at 398 K after pretreatments HTR1 and O/LTR. are found at lower dispersion. The effects of pretreatment are also qualitatively similar to those found on numerous occasions with Ru/Ti02 catalysts [6], although the differences in rate and in TOF are smaller. The O/LTR treatment of EC1 produces marked and reproducible changes in product selectivities, of a kind not found with EC3. We then determined the response of the rate and of the product selectivities to HZ pressure variation at 398 2 K: the results, which are shown in Figs. 1 to 4 are of considerable interest, and their main features are these. (1) After HTR1, the rate with EC 1 passes through a very sharp maximum at low HZ pressure (ca. 0.03 atm) and is strongly inhibited by higher Hz pressures (order in H2, -1.9, Fig. 1). (2) At HZ pressures above the rate maximum, the product selectivities are almost independent of Hz pressure, and are characterised by ( i ) a very high ethane selectivity SZ and a comparatively small formation of excess methane, i.e. St is only slightly greater than S3 (Fig. 2a). (3) The O/LTR treatment of ECl leads to dramatic differences: the rate maximum is now much broader and occurs at a higher H2 G.C. Bond, J.C.

(4) An equally startling change in product selectivity dependence on HZ pressure is brought about by the O/LTR treatment (Fig. 3a). Selectivities respond much more sensitively to change in HZ pressure, especially below the point of the rate maximum, the directions of the changes being (except for S3) the same as found after HTR1 at very low HZ pressures (Fig. 2a). It is helpful to express the product selectivities and their dependence on H2 pressure in terms of the Kempling-Anderson parameters F and T3: these are derived from the observed values of SZ and S3, and from the value of SZ found in the reaction of propane with HZ performed under identical conditions, as described above. The results are also shown in Figs. 2 and 3. With catalyst EC1 after HTR1, T3 is very close to unity (ca. 0.98) and the splitting parameter F is ca. 0.72; central C-C bond fission is clearly favoured, and intermediate species have a very high probability of reactive desorption. At HZ pressures above about 0.35 atm the rates are too low for the selectivities to give accurate values of these parameters (note the scatter of points in Fig. 2b). After the O/LTR treatment, the value of F falls to ca. 0.22 while T3 is a steep function of HZ pressure (Fig. 3). By plotting the function T3/(1-T3) against HZ pressure, we find that the ratio k3/k3 is quite accurately proportional to HZ pressure, signifying that reactive desorption of the Cj intermediate 226 G.

This provides good evidence for the dehydrogenated state of the intermediate. We note too that in both cases F is virtually independent of HZ pressure, while the Hz G.C. Bond, J.C. Slaa /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 221-228 227 pressure-dependence where it exists (Fig. 3b) operates as expected through the T3 parameter. These results provide excellent confirmation of the validity of the rate mechanism and the applicability of the Kempling-Anderson formalism. Although the O/LTR treatment of EC1 appears to result in considerable increase in particle size, we felt it desirable to confirm the effect by examining the less-well dispersed EC3 after HTR1, so that a comparison of dispersion could be made using identical pretreatments. As the results in Fig. 4 show, the maximum in the rate curve is indeed somewhat broader, but the order in HZ above the maximum ( -1.9) was about the same as for EC I. However the product selectivity dependence much more closely resembles that shown by EC1 after O/LTR than after HTRI. Finally we subjected EC1 after the O/LTR treatment to a second HTR (i.e. HTR2) and redetermined the rate dependence on HZ pressure (Fig. 4) ; the maximum has become somewhat sharper and the order more negative (-1.1) (compare Fig. 1), but the product selectivity dependence was almost unchanged. 4. Discussion The purpose of this note is to show that, at least in the case of reactions as mechanistically complex as those of alkanes with HZ on metal surfaces, conclusions drawn from observed dependence of rates measured under a single set of experimental conditions on some variable of the catalyst (dispersion, composition, pretreatment etc.) are at best of limited validity, and at worst may be completely misleading. Fig. I shows in a dramatic fashion how the conclusion reached concerning the effect of the O/LTR treatment on catalyst EC I depends critically on the HZ pressure at which the comparison is made. Furthermore, although the rates shown by this catalyst after HTRI and HTR2 are about the same both at 398 K (Figs. I and 4) and at 433 K (Table 1), the maximum rate is about 10 times faster after HTRl than HTR2. Thus the choice of experimental conditions may well determine the kind of effect reported, and this factor is likely to be partly responsible for the discrepancies in the literature mentioned above [ 1,3 ] . Under these or similar circumstances, how should comparisons be drawn? We suppose that the measured rate is the product of a rate constant for the rate-limiting surface reaction and the concentrations of the relevant adsorbed species, and that those are related to the gas-phase reactant pressures through equilibrium constants. We are at present engaged in seeking a suitable kinetic equation to describe our results, and we hope then to be able to separate the effects of catalyst structure on intrinsic activity and on adsorption strengths. It would appear from the results shown in Figs. 1 and 4 that the latter vary considerably with pretreatment and dispersion. It is therefore premature to attempt any detailed interpretation of our results thus far, although certain trends are clear. It seems for example that product selectivities are chiefly dependent on particle size and very little on pretreatment (Table 1). Very small particles of Ru (EC1/HTRI, Fig. 2) show a characteristic lack of dependence of selectivities on HZ pressure, suggesting that the composition of the reactive layer (i.e. the H/chemisorbed alkane ratio) may also be invariant and that it is simply the number of functioning active centres, or perhaps vacant surface sites, which determines how the rate changes with HZ pressure (Fig. I). This might betoken very strong H2 chemisorption on such particles. The 228 G.C. Bond, J.C. Slaa /Journal of Molecular Catalvsis 89 (1994) 221-228 results in Fig. 2 contrast with the behaviour of 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane, where the selectivities to 2,2,3-trimethylbutane and to isobutane are influenced by the H, pressure, perhaps because the intermediates differ in their degrees of dehydrogenation [ 11 ] . The effect of the O/LTR treatment on rate and on TOF (Table 1) is difficult to account for, and the results of our kinetic analysis are needed before an explanation is attempted. The maximum rates for EC 1 after HTR 1 and O/LTR are about the same (Fig. 1) but the TOF after HTR1 is lower by a factor of 5. It is possible that the LTR leaves a number of very active low-coordination-number Ru atoms on the surface, or there may be residual Rux+ ions which render the particles electron deficient. In this state the catalyst is far less prone to suffer loss of activity at low HZ/alkane ratios. The effect of HTR2 is to cancel this highly active state, but there is no great change in product selectivities. The phenomenon appears to be related to that observed by Kalakkad et al. [4] and by Gao and Schmidt [5] with a number of different metals. 5.

        "dc:description": "Turnover frequencies (TOF) for hydrogenolysis of n-butane on Ru/Al2O3 catalysts, measured with a 10-fold excess of H2, depend on dispersion and on pretreatment. After a first high-temperature reduction at 753 K (HTR1), 1% Ru/Al2O3 showed high dispersion and moderate activity; oxidation at 623 K followed by reduction at 433 K caused dispersion to decrease, and rates and TOFs to increase. However, the magnitude and even the sign of the effects depended on the H2 pressure used, because the form of the rate dependence on H2 pressure changed significantly. Many of the discrepancies in the literature concerning particle size effects may originate in the use of different conditions for measuring rates and of different pretreatments. Alterations in the form of the dependence of rates and of product selectivities on H2 pressure suggest that “structure sensitivity” in these systems may in fact be due to variations in the strength of H2 chemisorption.",
