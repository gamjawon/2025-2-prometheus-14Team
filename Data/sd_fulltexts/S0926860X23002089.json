The diatomic catalyst synthesized by high-temperature thermal cracking usually undergoes structural reorganization of raw materials, increasing the difficulty in studying the structure-activity relationship of the catalysts. Herein, starting from the synthesis methodology, we adjust the atomic spacing of dual-Pd-site catalysts to 0.4 and 0.8 nm by regulating the monomer structure of graphyne. The model experiment of nitrobenzene reduction shows that graphyne catalyst (TEGY-Pd) with closer palladium atom spacing (0.4 nm) show a faster reaction rate (1.57 min−1), good universality and cyclic stability in catalytic process than that of graphdiyne catalyst (TEGDY-Pd) which has longer palladium atom spacing. Moreover, the theoretical calculation shows that the excellent catalytic performance of TEGY-Pd is original from the synergetic catalysis of the closer diatomic palladium to the nitro group in adsorption and electron transport process. This work provided a new idea to precisely control the metal atomic spacing and revealed the structure activity relationship of binuclear catalysts. Graphical Abstract The atomic spacing of diatomic palladium catalysts was adjusted. TEGY-Pd with closer palladium atom spacing shows the synergistic dipole effect in nitrobenzene reduction reaction. ga1 Keywords Graphyne Atomic catalyst Nitroaromatic reduction Data Availability Data will be made available on request. 1 Introduction Single-metal site catalysts (SMCs), as one of the most innovative and active research frontiers in the field of catalysis, have attracted a lot of attention since it was proposed in 2011 [1]. Due to their ultrahigh atom utilization, relatively uniform local atomic structure and easy exploration of the reaction mechanisms, they have shown excellent potential in the energy conversion [1–3], environmental governance [4,5] and industrial catalysis [6–8]. In addition, for some advanced SMC systems, their structure-activity relationships have been studied in detail, such as metal-nitrogen-carbon catalysts [9,10]. Despite these achievements, some general problems about SMC still need to be solved. For instance, does the isolated active site represents the highest intrinsic catalytic activity, and how to improve its intrinsic activity? Adjusting the coordination geometry and electronic structure is usually employed to elevate the activity of atomic catalysts [11–15]. Great efforts have been made to enhance the intrinsic activity of SMC by adjusting the coordination geometry and electronic structure [16,17]. Recently, a feasible strategy for the synthesis of dual-metal-site catalysts (DMSCs) provides another approach to improve the intrinsic activity of atomically dispersed catalysts [18,19]. The definition of DMSCs is that the catalyst containing two adjacent active sites or two nonadjacent but different active sites, which directly or indirectly change the activation energies of raw materials during the reaction process [20]. In comparison with SMC, the diversity of dual-metal-site structures, their interactions of electronic structures, and the potential synergies between central atoms provide a more optimized structure for multi-step successive reactions [21,22]. So far, DMSC has been successfully applied to electric/photocatalytic energy conversion [23,24]. For example, compared with SMC, DMSC shows excellent catalytic performance in CO2 reduction [19,25], oxygen reduction [26,27] and methane dry reforming reactions [28]. Therefore, it has become very important to fundamentally understand the cooperative structure of dual-metal sites to improve their intrinsic activities, but the related research is still unclear. Additionally, there are few reports focus on the conversion of organic compounds in the study of DMSC [29]. Graphdiyne, as a novel carbon allotrope [30], has attracted wide attention due to its unique two-dimensional plane structure, high electrical conductivity, unique porous structure and varied synthetic structures [31]. Especially, due to the strong coordination between the acetylene bond in graphdiyne and metal atoms/ions [32–34], it has acted as an excellent supporting material in the preparation of SMCs [35,36]. However, although the graphdiyne-based SMCs had shown considerable potential in hydrogen production [32,34], CO2 reduction [37], N2 reduction [38,39] and other catalytic reactions [40,41], the graphdiyne-based DMSCs have only a small amount of theoretical research [42], and is rarely realized in experiments. Herein, using non-thermal cracking method, we designed and synthesized two kinds of graphyne like dual-palladium (Pd)-site catalysts with different Pd atom spacing by regulating the monomer structure of graphynes ( Scheme 1). The experimental and theoretical results show that the spacing of Pd atoms in the graphyne-Pd (TEGY-Pd) and graphdiyne-Pd (TEGDY-Pd) catalysts are around 0.4 nm and 0.8 nm, respectively. Finally, the two catalysts showed superior but different catalytic activities for the model reaction of nitrobenzene reduction to aminobenzene, which has been widely used in environmental governance and chemical production. [43–51] As nitroaromatic hydrocarbons are an environmental endocrine disruptor, while the aromatic amines are significant raw materials for preparing fine chemical products, such as agricultural chemicals, dyes, cosmetics, etc. Compared with TEGDY-Pd which possessing longer Pd atom spacing, TEGY-Pd shows higher catalytic rate constants (1.57 min−1 vs 0.74 min−1) due to the synergistic dipole effect of two Pd atoms to -NO2 group. This work provides a new idea for understanding the structure-activity relationship of heterogeneous catalysts at the atomic level, and expands the application of diatomic catalysts in organic catalysis. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis and characterization of TEGY and TEGDY TEGY and TEGDY were synthesized using mechanochemistry and organic chemistry methods [52] respectively (scheme S1). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements in Fig. S1 and S2 show that TEGDY and TEGY present two-dimensional nanosheets structure. The Raman spectra (Fig. S3) showed four obvious peaks for TEGY (TEGDY). Specifically, the peaks at 1330.5 cm−1 (1345.5 cm−1) and 1568.3 cm−1 (1580.2 cm−1) are attributed to the breathing vibration and the in-plane stretching vibration of the benzene ring sp2 hybrid carbon atom. In addition, the peaks at 1922.7 cm−1 and 2108.7 cm−1 (1929.7 cm−1 and 2111.2 cm−1) are attributed to the acetylene bond related peak of TEGY (TEGDY) [53,54]. Additionally, the solid-state 13C NMR spectrum (Fig. S4) of TEGY shows that there are three different types of C in TEGY material, corresponding to the sp2 hybrid carbon on the benzene ring (position 1), sp2 hybrid carbon at the junction of benzene ring and alkyne bond (position 2) and sp hybrid carbon at the alkyne bond (position 3). Furthermore, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted to analyse the electronic structure of TEGDY and TEGY (Fig. S5 and S6). Notably, the signal of oxygen in Fig. S5 might originate from the absorption of oxygen from air, or from partial oxidation of the alkynyl group [30,55]. The results in Fig. S6 show that the C 1s orbital of these two materials can be divided into four subpeaks at 284.6 eV (CC), 285.1 eV (CC), 286.7 eV (C−O) and 288.8 eV (CO) respectively [30]. Among them, the area ratio of sp2 and sp hybrid carbon in TEGDY and TEGY is close to 3:4 and 3:2 (Table S1), respectively. These results are consistent with the theoretical structures of TEGY and TEGDY in Scheme 1. Above results together indicate that two kinds of graphyne-like materials have been successfully synthesized. 2.2 Synthesis and characterization of TEGY-Pd and TEGDY-Pd TEGY-Pd and TEGDY-Pd were synthesized through a wet chemical method (see supporting information for details). The TEM images in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. S7(a) show that the morphology of TEGY-Pd and TEGDY-Pd were consistent with that of TEGY and TEGDY, indicating that the nano morphology of these two materials were maintained in the metal loading process. Significantly, there are no visible metal particles or clusters in the TEM images, which are consistent with the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) results in Fig. S8-S9, suggesting that TEGY and TEGDY substrates have excellent dispersion performance for metal palladium salts. Furthermore, the elemental mapping images demonstrate that C and Pd elements disperse homogeneously on TEGY-Pd (Fig. 1(b–d)) and TEGDY-Pd (Fig. S7(b–d)). To investigate the fine microstructure of the loaded Pd element, the high angle ring dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) characterization was conducted on spherical aberration electron microscope. The results in Fig. 1(e) and Fig. S7(e) show that the metal palladium was monodispersed on TEGY or TEGY substrate. Through statistical calculation, the distances between Pd sites in TEGY-Pd and TEGDY-Pd are about 0.4 nm (Fig. 1(e, inset)) and 0.8 nm (Fig. S7(e, inset)), respectively, which is consistent with the DFT calculations. Furthermore, XPS measurements were conducted to identify the chemical state of the Pd element in TEGY-Pd (Fig. 1(f)) and TEGDY-Pd (Fig. S7(f)). The signals at 338.1 (338.0) eV and 343.3 (343.2) eV for Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 clearly show that Pd in TEGY-Pd (TEGDY-Pd) is positively charged, with valence between 0 and +2 [56,57]. Since Pd element in the raw material is + 2 valence, the reduced valence state in the composite was ascribed to the interaction between Pd ion and TEGY/TEGDY substrate [53,54]. It is noteworthy that the binding energy of Pd in TEGY-Pd is higher than that in TEGDY-Pd, indicating that the electron donating ability of TEGDY is stronger than that of TEGY. The comparison Raman spectra of TEGY-Pd and TEGY (Fig. 1(g)) show that the characteristic peaks of the alkyne bond at 2108.7 cm−1 had a blue shift, so is TEGDY-Pd (Fig. S7(g)), which further indicates that chelation exists between Pd ion and alkyne bond of TEGY/TEGDY. On the basis of above results, Pd ions were loaded as dual-site type onto two-dimensional TEGY and TEGDY nanosheets with different pore sizes by simple wet chemical method. The inductively coupled plasma (ICP) tests (Fig. S10, Table S2) illustrate that the contents of palladium in TEGY-Pd and TEGDY-Pd are 0.37 % and 0.34 %, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalytic reduction of nitroaromatics Inspired by the highly dispersed nature of Pd ions and the different Pd ions spacing of TEGDY-Pd and TEGY-Pd, the nitrobenzene reduction was chosen as a model reaction to value the intrinsic relations between Pd ion spacing and their catalytic activity. Specifically, the reduction process was monitored by ultraviolet visible absorption spectrum (UV–vis) measurement. As shown in Fig. S11, the NaBH4 itself cannot reduce 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) in the absence of catalyst. Upon addition of TEGDY-Pd or TEGY-Pd to the mixture solution of 4-NP and NaBH4 ( Fig. 2), the signal around 400 nm decreases rapidly with time, while a new peak around 300 nm, which was ascribed to the characteristic signal of 4-aminophenol (4-AN) [58], appeared. According to the pseudo-first-order formula ln (C t /C 0) = kt, where C t and C 0 represent the concentrations of 4-NP at time t and 0, respectively. Consequently, the reaction rate constant k can be obtained by monitoring the concentration changes of 4-NP through UV–vis spectra. As shown in Fig. 2(c) and Table S3, the reaction rate constants of TEGDY-Pd and TEGY-Pd composites were calculated to be 0.74 min−1 and 1.57 min−1 respectively, in which the rate constant of TEGY-Pd was 2.1 times that of TEGDY-Pd. Actually, the influence of Pd content in TEGY-Pd on the reduction of 4-NP has also been explored. The results in Table S5 show that when the contents of Pd in TEGY-Pd are controlled at 0.15 %, 0.37 %, 0.53 %, and 0.65 %, the reaction rate constants for 4-NP reduction were measured as 1.45 min−1, 1.57 min−1, 1.00 min−1, and 0.68 min−1, respectively. Such results demonstrate that with the content of Pd increase, the catalytic performance of TEGY-Pd shows a volcanic trend. The optimal content of Pd is 0.37 %. Thus, we controlled similar Pd content (0.34 %) to explore the catalytic performance of TEGDY-Pd. Moreover, the catalytic performance of these two dual-Pd-site catalysts exceed that of most of the reported catalysts (Table S6). These results demonstrate that both TEGDY-Pd and TEGY-Pd have excellent ability to reduce 4-NP to 4-AN. While TEGY-Pd shows higher catalytic activity for 4-NP reduction than TEGDY-Pd. The universal applicability of TEGY-Pd were also investigated with other nitroarenes such as 2-nitrophenol, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol, 4-nitroaniline, 3-nitroaniline and 2-nitroaniline. As shown in Fig. S12, TEGY-Pd can catalyse the reduction of all the above nitroarenes and shows high catalytic activity with the rate constant ranging from 0.90 min−1 to 20.68 min−1 (Table S4). These results suggest that TEGY-Pd is widely applicable to the reduction of nitroaromatics. Additionally, the cycle test for the reduction of 4-NP reaction by TEGY-Pd complex in Fig. 2(d) show that, after eight cycles, the conversion rate of 4-NP remained at a constant value (>99 %). Additionally, the XRD, TEM, and ICP measurements in Fig. S13-S15 demonstrate that the morphology, the nanostructure and the content of Pd in TEGY-Pd are basically remain unchanged after the recycling, indicating that TEGY-Pd has excellent cycle stability. 3.2 DFT calculation To better understand the intrinsic mechanism of TEGDY-Pd and TEGY-Pd on 4-nitrophenol reduction, DFT calculations on the reaction process were carried out ( Fig. 3). Firstly, 4-nitrophenol molecule is adsorbed on the surface of TEGDY-Pd (red line)/TEGY-Pd (black line), in which one of the O atoms in -NO2 group combines with one Pd atom of TEGDY-Pd/TEGY-Pd. In this process, the adsorption energies of TEGDY-Pd and TEGY-Pd to 4-NP are −0.47 eV and −0.98 eV, respectively, indicating the binding capacity of TEGY-Pd to 4-NP is stronger than TEGDY-Pd. Furthermore, the adsorption rate constants of TEGDY-Pd and TEGY-Pd to 4-NP were valued by IR (Fig. S16) and UV–vis spectroscopy (Fig. S17) measurements as 2.07 g/(g∙min) and 5.37 g/(g∙min), respectively. The adsorption rate of TEGY-Pd is 2.59 times that of TEGDY-Pd, further indicating the stronger binding capacity of TEGY-Pd to 4-NP than that of TEGDY-Pd. In addition, the charge difference density analysis (Fig. 3(c)) shows that when one Pd atom of TEGY-Pd anchors 4-nitrophenol, the electron cloud density of the other Pd atom changes more obviously than that of TEGDY-Pd. Meanwhile, as the two Pd atoms in TEGY-Pd is closer, the second O atom in the -NO2 group is more likely to have dipole interaction with the second Pd atom than TEGDY-Pd. Further, differential density charge analysis shows that for TEGY-Pd structure, the hydrogen atom in the hydroxyl group has an obvious charge transfer interaction with another Pd atom. While for TEGDY-Pd structure, there is no such interaction, indicating that TEGY-Pd has a stronger stabilizing effect on the intermediate of 4-NP reduction. In this reaction process (1→2), the free energy of TEGY-Pd and TEGDY-Pd are 0.001 eV and 0.30 eV respectively, suggesting that TEGDY-Pd needs to overcome greater energy barrier in this process. The possible reason is that the adjacent Pd ions in TEGY-Pd have a strong stabilizing effect on the intermediate of 4-NP reduction. Subsequently, after successive protonation and electron transfer, structure 2 is transformed into structure 6, and 4-AN (structure 7) is generated after hydrogenation. Finally, the desorption energy of 4-AN from TEGY-Pd and TEGDY-Pd are 0.22 eV and 0.60 eV, respectively, indicating that 4-AN is much easier to desorb from TEGY-Pd than TEGDY-Pd. To sum up, for TEGY-Pd and TEGDY-Pd, the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP is an energy decreasing process. Only the two processes 1→2 and 3→4 need to absorb energy. While TEGY-Pd requires less energy than TEGDY-Pd in these two transformations and so is the final desorption process. Collectively, experiments and theoretical calculations show that TEGY-Pd with closer Pd atoms has higher catalytic activity for the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP than that of TEGDY-Pd dual-metal site catalyst. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have designed and synthesized two kinds of graphyne-like materials with different pore sizes as substrates. Drawing support from the strong anchoring effect of TEGY and TEGDY to metal atoms, dual-site Pd atoms were successfully loaded on these two substrates with Pd distances of 0.4 nm and 0.8 nm. Consequently, TEGY-Pd composite showed much higher catalytic activity to the reduction of nitroaromatics than TEGDY-Pd. DFT calculations revealed that the high catalytic activity of TEGY-Pd was original from the reasonable distance between Pd atoms which could realize synergistic dipole effect to the reactant. Therefore, the unique atom structure of TEGY will make it expected to become a promising graphyne carbon material, which can be used to stabilize different dual metal sites and developed more potentials in various catalytic reactions.

        "dc:description": "The diatomic catalyst synthesized by high-temperature thermal cracking usually undergoes structural reorganization of raw materials, increasing the difficulty in studying the structure-activity relationship of the catalysts. Herein, starting from the synthesis methodology, we adjust the atomic spacing of dual-Pd-site catalysts to 0.4 and 0.8 nm by regulating the monomer structure of graphyne. The model experiment of nitrobenzene reduction shows that graphyne catalyst (TEGY-Pd) with closer palladium atom spacing (0.4 nm) show a faster reaction rate (1.57 min−1), good universality and cyclic stability in catalytic process than that of graphdiyne catalyst (TEGDY-Pd) which has longer palladium atom spacing. Moreover, the theoretical calculation shows that the excellent catalytic performance of TEGY-Pd is original from the synergetic catalysis of the closer diatomic palladium to the nitro group in adsorption and electron transport process. This work provided a new idea to precisely control the metal atomic spacing and revealed the structure activity relationship of binuclear catalysts.",
