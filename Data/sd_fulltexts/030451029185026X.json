Price* Department of Chemical Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 (USA.) and Vladislav Kanazirev Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Organic Chemistry, 1040 Sofia (Bulgaria) (Received July 24, 1990; accepted September 14, 1990) Abstract Gallium nitrate-impregnated NaZSM-5 and HZSM-5 light paraffin aromatization catalysts have been reduced via hydrogen in a microbalance, and a disparity in the degree of reduction of gallium was determined. This result suggests that catalytic activity differences in the two materials may be associated with the degree of gallium reduction. Introduction Recent reports in the open literature on gallium-containing ZSM-5 light paraffin aromatization catalysts have focused on a bifunctional mechanism for the catalytic conversion process [ 1-5 ]. Our recent reports on mechanical mixtures of Ga203/HZSM-5 [6, 7], however, have shown that these galliumcontaining catalysts undergo chemical transformation upon treatment with hydrogen or via treatment with a propane feedstock. The question which then arises is whether or not the bifunctional acid/gallium mechanism actually exists or whether there is a chemical transformation of acid/gallium sites to produce a new site. To address this question, some observations on the reduction potential of Ga203 ball-milled with HZSM-5 and differences between Ga(N03)3/HZSM-5 and Ga(N03)3/NaZSM-5 are reported. Experimental MFI zeolite (Si02/A1203 = 40), which is equivalent to ZSM-5 in the protonated form, was obtained from UOP. We have determined that it contains 10.0% water off-the-shelf. NaZSM-5 was prepared by two successive exchanges of the HZSM-5 with 5 equivalents of NaN03. The NaZSM-5 was washed once between exchanges and thrice after the second exchange.

The first type, involving impregnation of both the HZSM-5 and NaZSM-5, was accomplished by adding an aqueous solution of 1.834 g Ga(N03)3 - 9H20 to 5 g of the zeolite by incipient wetness techniques. On a wet basis, this represents - 5.2 wt.% Ga or - 5.8 wt.% Ga on a dry basis. These catalysts are designated 5g'o Ga(N03)3/HZSM-5 and 5% Ga(N03)3/ NaZSM-5. Both impregnated materials were dried overnight at 85 C following Ga impregnation. The second type of Ga loading was accomplished by ball-milling 13-Ga203 with HZSM-5. Both the degree of loading and the length of the ball-milling time were varied. Loadings of 2 and 10 wt.% Ga as Ga203 were prepared at ball-milling times of 0.5, 1.5, 3 and 6. These are referred to as XX-Ga,303/ HZSM-5 /YY, where XX is the loading in wt.% (2 or 10) and YY is the ballmilling time in hours (0.5, 1.5, 3 or 6). Table 1 lists the 10 catalysts which were studied. A microbalance (Perldn Elmer TGA7) was used to detect the hydrogen reduction capacity of each material. Prior to reduction, the materials were treated in 125 cm' min-' of He (passed through a liquid nitrogen trap to remove traces of H20) while the temperature was raised from 40 to 607 C at 10 C min-' followed by isothermal treatment for 3 h at 607 C. A few minutes before the reduction experiment, the sample was cooled to 575 C, and after equilibration at 575 C for 1 min, a step change of 25 cm' min-' of HZ was substituted for 25 cm3 mind of the He purge, so that the overall purge rate remained 125 cm' min-'. An isothermal reduction curve is thus obtained. Results and Discussion Figure 1 shows the reduction curves obtained for the set of 8 ball-milled catalyst samples. The initial increase in weight which can be observed for times less than 10 min in some of the curves is apparently primarily due 117 100.00. d 99.50 G. x m 99.00- 98.50 (A) (H) (C) (D) (E) (F) 60 80 100 120 140 160 Time (min) Flg. 1.

A sample of quartz placed in the microbalance pan yields a buoyancy-induced increase of about 0.02 wt.%, which is negligible and no corrections for buoyancy have been made. Comparing curves A, B, C, and D in Fig. 1, which correspond to 2% Ga loading, we note that increasing the ball-milling time generally improves the initial rate of reduction (corresponding to the slope shortly after the initial weight increase) and also increases the ultimate degree of reduction which can be obtained in 150 min. Curve D for 2% Gaz03/HZSM5/6 h depicts the largest degree of reduction for the 2% Ga samples and the overall weight decline is 0.653 wtX Complete reduction of Ga203 according to: (1) would result in a theoretical weight decline of 0.686 wt.%. However, if it is assumed that the stoichiometric reaction proceeds according to: Ga203 + 3H2 -~ 2Ga+ 3H20 Ga203+2H+Z- + 2Hz ~ 2Ga+Z- + 3H20 (2) (where Z- is the anionic zeolite framework) which is the proposed stoichiometry given in [7], it is seen that Ga.203 is the limiting reactant and that the theoretical weight decline is 0.714%. Via either proposed stoichiometric pathway, the correlation is good and the reaction is nearly complete. It is also noted in Curves E, F, G, and H (Fig. 1) for the 10% Ga loading that increasing ball-milling time generally results in an improved initial rate of reduction. Curves G and H are almost identical, suggesting that very little is gained by ball-milling times in excess of 3 h for the 1096 Ga materials. its According to the reduction stoichiometry in eqn. (1), an ultimate weight decline of 3.43 wt.% is expected, whereas only 1.48 wt.% is observed for curve H. According to the stoichiometry in eqn. (2), the zeolite is the limiting reactant in this case; based upon Si02/AI203 = 40 a theoretical weight decline of 1.63ss'o is computed. Thus, the present results are entirely consistent with the results given in [ 7 ] and the stoichiometry which involves the zeolite (eqn. (2)) is the preferred pathway. The novel result, that increases in the ball-milling time (and thus the degree of intimacy of Ga203 with HZSM-5) cause an increase in the rate of reduction without improving the ultimate degree of reduction beyond the stoichiometric amount given by eqn. (2), further suggests that the reduction process involves both the zeolite and Ga203. The nature of the reduction of Ga203 ball-milled with HZSM-5 apparently is based upon the degree to which areas of direct contact of Ga203 with zeolite can be created. For the 2ss'o Ga-loaded materials in which Ga203 is the limiting reactant, longer ball-milling times improve the ultimate degree of reduction, even up to 6 h. Increasing the ball-milling time also increases the initial rate, which is expected to be roughly proportional to the contact area between Ga203 and HZSM-5. Unreacted Ga203 is simply indicative of Ga203 which has not been forced into contact with the zeolite. However, when Ga203 is in excess, as in the 10% Ga-loaded samples, contact areas apparently can be achieved equivalent to the stoichiometric limit with relativity short ball-milling times (< 3 h). Though further ball-milling may improve the contact area, the zeolite does not have the capacity to accept all of the gallium. Equation (2) can be broken down into two steps (though these are unproven and shown for convenience only), which helps visualize the ramifications of the reduction process: Ga203 + 2112 -- Ga20 + 21120 (2a) Ga20+211+Z- -) 1120+2Ga+Z- (2b) Evidence we have accumulated to date suggests that (2a) will not proceed without (2b) since the zeolite is in many cases the limiting reactant. Equation (2b) is, in essence, an ion-exchange process. 1120 which is formed in this reaction is volatile and leaves the system, creating anion sites in the zeolite which accommodate the Ga+ counter-ions. It is possible to construct systems where the product of the ion-exchange process (eqn. (2b)) is not volatile and will not leave the system, as shown below. Are these systems still capable of accepting the Ga+ counter-ion and undergoing reduction? Turning our attention now to the Ga(N03)3-loaded catalysts, upon drying at 607 C, we expect (as others have [ 1 ]) that Ga(N03)3 is converted to Ga2O3. Figure 2 gives the results of the hydrogen reduction of 5% Ga(N03)3/ HZSM-5 and 5% Ga(N03)3/NaZSM-5 which have already been dried. Focusing first on the Ga(N03)3/HZSM-5 material, the final weight decline is 1.59%. According to eqn. (2) the zeolite is the limiting reactant and a weight decline of 1.73% is expected which, within experimental error, compares favorably 119 Hydrogen added i00.0o- C (B) 57 Ga(N03)3/NaZSM-5 y 99.50 0. 99.00 A) 5% Ga(N03)3/HZSM-5 98.50 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Time (min) Fig. 2.

On the other hand, the 5% Ga/NaZSM-5 undergoes considerably less reduction, 0.5990. The equivalent stoichiometry: Ga203 +2Na+Z-+2H2) 2Ga+Z-+Na20+2H20 (3) can be written and a theoretical weight decline of 1.25% calculated, but a weight decline of only about half this value has been observed. Using eqn. (1), the correlation is even worse since 1.99% reduction is expected. Therefore, reduction of Ga is not complete when the NaZSM-5 base is used. This is an example of a system, mentioned before, in which the expected product of the ion-exchange reaction is non-volatile, and can be rewritten: Ga203 + 2H2 Ga20 + 2H20 (3a) Ga20 + 2Na+Z- -) Na20 + Ga+Z- (3b) The Na20 product of (3b) is not volatile and will not leave the system. There will be no anionic vacancies created and there is no propensity for Ga+ to move into the zeolite. Therefore, reduction of Ga is not complete, as is observed. The small level of reduction which is seen is probably due to two effects, (1) residual protons which can leave the system via eqn. (2b), and (2) a competition between Na+ and Ga+ for anionic zeolite sites. In studying similar Ga(N03)3/HZSM-5 and Ga(N03)3/NaZSM-5 catalysts, Meriaudeau and Naccache [ 1 ] found a striking difference in the rate of propane conversion to propene and aromatics for catalysts of composition nearly identical to the Ga(N03)3 catalysts studied here. They have assumed that Ga203 exists as an active species on both materials and, developing a bifunctional mechanism involving acid/Ga203 sites, have attributed the differences in catalytic activity to the lack of acidity of the NaZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5. Our postulate is different: the reduction of Ga203 is linked to improved catalytic performance of Ga203/HZSM-5 mechanically mixed catalysts, and 120 it is shown that these materials may be reduced via exposure to a propane feedstock [6, 7]. Furthermore, results presented in Fig. 1 show that the more intimate the physical mixture of Ga203/HZSM-5, the faster the reduction proceeds, while the ultimate degree of reduction is still limited by the zeolite. Ga203/HZSM-5 formed from the impregnation of Ga(N03)3 on HZSM-5 is expected to be of essentially the highest possible `intimate mixing' and therefore it should undergo reduction via propane feedstock very quickly. Indeed, the maximum observed rate of reduction in H2 for 10% Gaz03/HZSM5/6 h is about 4%/h, whereas the maximum observed rate for the 5% Ga(N03)3/HZSM-5 is 309o/h. It is clear that the Ga(N03),9/HZSM-5 undergoes reduction with stoichiometry similar to the Ga203/HZSM-5 ball-milled catalysts, but Ga(N03)3/NaZSM-5 cannot undergo the same degree of reduction. Thus, we postulate that a major difference in catalytic activity of Ga/HZSM-5 versus Ga/NaZSM-5 is the more highly reduced state of gallium in the Ga/HZSM5 material compared to Ga/NaZSM-5. The catalytic effect due to the disparity in acidity of the two materials may be obscured by the difference in the gallium oxidation state. Conclusions Given the observations that gallium loaded on acidic forms of ZSM-5 undergoes hydrogen reduction and that reduced materials yield catalysts with improved performance capabilities, theories directed at the relationship between catalyst composition and catalytic activity need to be re-evaluated to include the possibility of a reduced gallium oxidation state.
