Introduction The structure and catalytic activity of transition metal-graphite compounds (graphimets) have been the subject of many previous studies [1-9]. Graphimets are formed via the intercalation of transition metal chlorides into graphite, a layered host material, and their subsequent reduction [10]. Very often, the result of intercalation is the appearance of small metal clusters on the graphite surface in addition to the presence of interlayer metal atoms [7,11-13]. In terms of catalytic transformations, the surface metal content is considered to be more important than the intercalate [11-13]. The present paper deals with a structural investigation of Pd-graphimet, an extremely active hydrogenation catalyst [14]. TEM and SAXS measurements provided information on the location of the catalytically active metal and the surface heterogeneity of the sample. Moreover, the active sites were distinguished and characterized by 1-butene titration, performed by Augustine's method, developed for supported metal catalysts [15-18]. Since the interlayer metal is reported to be fairly mobile and may therefore undergo migration upon heating [19], the effects of thermal treatment on the structure and activity of Pd-graphimet were also investigated. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials Pd-graphimet (1% Pd in graphite) was a product of Alfa Chemical Company. Thermal treatment of the sample (medium-temperature reduction, MTR) was carried out in flowing H2 (flow rate: 40 cm3/min) at 573 K for 1 h. The pretreated sample was then stored under He until use. Graphite powder (Aldrich) was used for comparative experiments. 2.2. Methods 2.2.1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Measurements were performed with an OPTON 902 electron microscope at 80 kV. Each sample was ultrasonically dispersed in toluene and mounted on a plastic film supported by a Formvar grid, where the suspension was air-dried. Electron micrographs were taken at a magnification of 85 000 times. The mean particle sizes were determined as number average diameters (Znidi/Gni) from the magnified TEM images, for 200 particles on average. 2.2.2. Specific surface area (BET) Experiments were carried out with a Micromeritics Gemini Type 2735 automatic apparatus. Prior to measurement, the samples were evacuated at I(. Mastalir et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 237-248 239 1.3 l0 2 Pa and 373 K for 24 h. The measurements were performed at 77.4 K in liquid N2. The specific surface areas a~ were calculated via the BET equation. 2.2.3. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) Measurements were made by using a compact Kratky camera (Anton Paar, model KCEC/3 1129) with an 80 ~m entrance slit and a 100 ~m detector slit. Measurements were effected for 3 h under a He atmosphere. The scattered X-ray intensities Is were determined with a PW 1710 control unit and control software. For the normalized scattering intensity I, the scattering of the back- ground was corrected for. Since the scattering curve in the Guinier region was not suitable for evaluation, the middle part and the tail end of the scattering curve (Porod region) were taken into account [20]. The representation log I=f (log h) allowed determination of the surface fractal dimensions of the samples from the slopes p, as Ds = p + 5 [21-23]. On the basis of the earlier results of Porod [24], the intensity of scattered radiation was described by J~nosi as follows [25]: l(h) '/\" =lo'/\" q--l(~l/nb2h2 (1) where Io is the zero-angle intensity, b is half the intersection length l~, a parameter of the statistical distribution of inhomogeneities within the system, and h = (4~sin0)/h is the scattering vector [26]. The value of n for a smeared beam is 3/2. According to Jfinosi [25], the constant of Porod, Kp, which is correlated with the relative internal surface of the system, can be expressed by Eq. 2: = z,,/b (2) The relative specific surface area of the system can be given by Eq. (3): S/V = 4wlw2 Kp/M1 (3) where wl and w2 are the volume fractions of the phases, and MI denotes the first moment of the correlation function [25]. 2.2.4. H2 titration The number of exposed Pd atoms was determined in a flow reactor by using 99.9995% pure argon as carrier gas. Titration was performed by preadsorbing 02 on the sample at room temperature for different periods of time. In order to prevent the transformation of Pd into the [3-hydride, the sample was heated to 348 K before the introduction of He pulses [27]. The ratio of the exposed Pd atoms was calculated for a stoichiometry Pd:H = 1:3 derived from the titration reaction Pd(O) + 1.5 H2 ---) Pd(H) + H20 [28]. 240 A~ Mastalir et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 237-248 2.2.5. 1-Butene titration Measurements were carried out at 298 K or 323 K in a flow reactor system connected to a Hewlett-Packard 5890 Series II gas chromatograph. The mass of catalyst was 20 mg and the carrier gas used was 99.996% pure He. The reactant 1-butene (99.3% pure, a Linde product) was introduced via a 25 ixl sampling valve. The products formed (butane, and cis- and trans-2-butenes) were sepa- rated on a Chrompack fused silica gel column with a stationary phase of A1203/KC1. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was pretreated either at 298 K or at 323 K as follows: at 298 K, the sample was flushed with He for 30 min, H2 for 1 h and He again for 30 min. Alternatively, the sample was purged at 298 K in He for 30 min and then heated to 323 K. The gas stream was next switched to H2 and the sample was exposed for 1 h. Finally, a He purge for 30 min was applied and the sample was cooled to 298 K. After the removal of excess H2 by successive 1-butene pulses, the sample was used in the single turnover (STO) reaction sequence. The catalyst was first treated with a large pulse of H2, which made every Pd atom saturated. After a 15 min sweep-off by He, another pulse of 1-butene was introduced. Product analysis was followed by a second H2 pulse, applied to remove unreacted 1-butene from the catalyst surface. The active sites of the catalyst were related to those reported for homoge- neous complexes by Siegel et al. [16,29]. Accordingly, the formation of butane is attributed to the presence of 3M sites (corner or kink atoms), capable of adsorbing three species at a time. lsomerization is assigned to 2M centres (edge or step atoms), on which two species can be adsorbed. 1M sites (plane, face or terrace atoms) may adsorb a single atom such as H, but do not participate in any of the above reactions. More recently, Augustine suggested that 3M sites might be surface adatoms and that 3MH sites might be corner atoms [30]. The results were evaluated on the assumption that, under the above experimental conditions, hydrogen migration on the surface may be ignored and thus each active site reacts only once in the STO reaction sequence [15,31]. 3. Results and discussion Figs. 1 and 2 display electron micrographs of Pd-graphimet before and after MTR. The particle size distributions of the two samples are illustrated in Fig. 3. The Pd crystallites of the pristine sample appear to be rather inhomogeneous, ranging in size from 1 to 48 rim. Fig. 3 indicates the predominance of small (1-2 nm) particles. Whereas the aggregates are randomly distributed on the surface of Pd-graphimet, the small particles are situated in groups, next to each other. More Pd crystallites were observed on the MTR sample than on the original one. This is attributed to the migration of interlayer Pd to the surface. MTR also made the TEM image look more homogeneous as it decreased the number of 1-2 nm particles and slightly increased that of large, 20-60 nm /(.

The particle size range was nearly the same as before and no change in particle morphology was apparent. On MTR, the 2-4 nm crystallites became predominant, which suggests a moderate sintering effect. The mean particle diameter was found to be 4.51 nm and 5.84 nm for the pristine and the MTR sample, respectively. For the above samples, the BET surface areas, together with the parameters of SAXS measurements, are collected in Table 1. In accordance with the TEM data, MTR increased the specific surface area of Pd-graphimet.

Kp calculated from Fig. 4 indicate a marked increase following the intercalation of Pd into graphite. The difference in Kp between the support and Pd-graphimet was much more significant than that between the latter and the MTR sample. This is also indicated by the values of the correlation length, that suggest no appreciable change in the distribution of interlayer inhomogeneities after MTR. It is important to stress that J~nosi's approximation (although basically developed for particles of spherical symmetry) gave a good fit for our layered-structure samples. The values of S/V also reveal that the effect of Pd insertion was far more pronounced than that of MTR. The enhancement of the relative internal surface is attributed to a loosening of the graphite layers upon Pd intercalation and may be regarded as a further confirmation of the presence of interlayer metal. The difference between as obtained by means of BET measurements and the S/V values determined from SAXS is not very surprising, as the former method is related to the surface, whereas the latter provides information on the internal structure. The surface fractal dimensions Ds were determined from Fig. 5. A. Mastalir et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 237-248 243 -25 -20 0-\" I Pd-graphimet Fig. 3.

Logarithmic representation of scattering curves obtained for graphite, Pd-graphimet and MTR Pd-graphimet. As reported previously [32,33], the surface fractal dimension of a sample is a measure of the surface irregularity; and its value may be 2 < Ds < 3. For the graphite support, the value of Ds only slightly exceeded 2 which corresponds to a perfectly regular, smooth surface. Intercalation of Pd created an intrinsically irregular surface with Ds = 2.847 which resembles the values for 'space-filling' 2O lO 30 , , ' , 25 / / 5 0 I J 10 Pd-graphimet IOO 75 ~ so 25 [ , 2O time (days) i , i , I 1o 2o 30 time (h) I 3O 40 Fig. 6.

As the surface heterogeneity of Pd-graphimet was already very high, there was no reason to expect any dramatic change in Ds due to MTR. In fact, the fractal dimension of the MTR sample was very close to that of the pristine one, and the difference may well be in the range of the experimental error. The evidence that Pd-graphimet and the MTR sample have equally high fractal dimensions indicates that both samples tend to form a three-dimensional condensed reactant phase on their surface [36]. Hence, reactant mobility can not be held responsible for differences in catalytic activities. The dispersion of Pd-graphimet is not interpreted in the same way as that of conventional supported Pd catalysts. Since interlayer Pd atoms are present, the use of 'exposed Pd' would be more appropriate. What is actually detected by H2 titration may involve some of the inserted metal besides the active surface Pd. Fig. 6 depicts the change in the proportion of exposed Pd atoms with the oxidation time. For the pristine sample, a maximum value of 25% was attained within 5 weeks. Experiments on supported Pd samples revealed that oxidation of the surface Pd occurred much more rapidly. The experimental evidence that the complete oxidation of the exposed metal of Pd-graphimet takes such a long time confirms that Oa (and subsequently H2) may enter between the graphite layers and undergo adsorption there. The effect of MTR on the sample resulted in a striking 100% value, which means that all of the Pd atoms become exposed within 30 h of oxidation. This is contradictory to what is generally expected for the sintering of supported metal catalysts [37], but graphimets are different. Since their interlayer metal content is fairly mobile, thermal treatment may give rise to metal migration on the surface, even at temperatures so mild that supported samples are still unaffected [19,38]. The complete exposure of Pd atoms after MTR is therefore attributed to atomic migration of interlayer Pd from the graphite layers, which makes all the Pd content active for 02 and H2 chemisorption. It is still open to question, however, whether such Pd is entirely situated on the surface or not. The method of l-butene titration permitted us to establish if the active Pd sites thus formed are available for reactant molecules of considerably larger size. Furthermore, the stoichiometric reaction of 1-butene distinguished between hydrogenation and isomerization sites. Table 2 presents the experimental data, calculated as mol product per mol Pd. The reaction products were the same for both samples: butane and cis-2- butene. Sample reduction and/or reaction at 323 K were performed to investi- gate the influence of mild heating on the number of active sites without damaging the initial structure. Previous experiments on Pd-graphimet revealed that no dramatic structural change took place below 373 K. In neither case was secondary butane formation detected, which indicated the lack of 3MH centres. As Pd is well known to be an effective isomerization catalyst in general, the absence of secondary butane is related to the fast desorption of the half-hydro- genated species from the active centres. 246 A.

The evidence that the number of isomerization (2M) centres on the original sample was considerably higher than that of hydrogenation (3M) sites also confirms that Pd is efficient in isomerization. Reduction at 323 K slightly increased the number of 3M sites, which is attributed to deintercalation of the inserted Pd atoms, leading to the formation of more adatom-type centres. Meanwhile, the isomerization activity decreased. When both the pretreatment and the reaction were carded out at 323 K, a significant drop in hydrogenation activity was obtained, whereas the number of 2M sites was less affected. Experimental data on the MTR sample clearly indicate decreased numbers of both 3M and 2M sites. Consequently, the above dispersion of 100% would not hold for 1-butene, which is transformed on even less active Pd than previously. Hence, 1-butene is claimed to be unable to enter between the graphite layers; it contacts exclusively the surface centres. Table 2 also suggests that mild heating has no appreciable effect on any of the active sites after MTR. Whereas the number of 2M centres hardly changes, the fall in hydrogenation activity is somewhat more pronounced. Via recrystallization of the active surface Pd atoms, MTR apparently results in an irreversible change in structure which is quite insensitive to any further treatment at lower temperature. It might be of interest to know the ratio of surface active sites available for the transformation of 1-butene. The values in Table 2 were calculated by considering the modified Horiuti-Polfinyi mechanism based on the adsorption of one alkene molecule per active site [39,40]. It is seen that for pristine Pd-graphimet at 298 K, 9.7% of the total Pd content is involved in the reaction of 1-butene, i.e. at least this amount must be situated on the surface as a fine metal dispersion (1-2 nm particles, see Fig. 3). The remainder of the Pd is inaccessible for 1-butene, either as interlamellar metal or as surface aggregates. The decreased active Pd content observed for the sample pretreated at 323 K suggested that even gentle heating may result in a moderate sintering of surface Pd clusters. Such a slight effect, though, is unlikely to be detected by TEM and SAXS measurements. When the reaction was performed ,4. Mastalir et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 237-248 247 at 323 K, the ratio of active Pd increased to some extent. This may be due to surface H 2 migration from 1M sites to catalytically active Z M or -~M centres and may occur on the MTR sample as well. The decreased amount of active Pd found after MTR (3-4%) is mainly attributed to the sintering of surface Pd crystallites, also indicated by the TEM and SAXS data. Aggregation of the surface Pd is likely to occur by crystal migration leading to the formation of more regular crystallites involving considerably less adatoms than before. The effect of coke formation is unlikely under the present experimental conditions [36]. It is also concluded that most of the 'active' Pd of the MTR sample detected by H2 titration remains between the graphite layers after migration, where it is accessible for 02 and H2, but not for l-butene. Therefore, as concerns the reaction of l-butene, Pd-graphimet may be regarded as a supported Pd catalyst. 4. Conclusions It was confirmed that Pd-graphimet contains a considerable amount of metal between the graphite layers. The surface Pd content of the sample was found to be consist of small (1-2 nm) particles and aggregates of different sizes. The surface of Pd-graphimet was highly irregular. The hydrogenation and isomeriza- tion activities of the pristine sample are attributed solely to the presence of the 1-2 nm Pd crystallites. Mild heating to 323 K gave rise to slight deintercalation and recrystallization of the surface Pd clusters. On MTR, all the interlayer Pd atoms underwent migration and subsequently became fully accessible for 02 and H2 chemisorption. MTR induced a moderate sintering of the active surface Pd particles, which substantially decreased the numbers of 3M and 2M sites involved in 1-butene titration. As not more than 9% of the total Pd represented the catalytically active component of Pd-graphimet, and this was further dimin- ished by MTR, the sample is regarded as a supported catalyst with respect to the transformation of 1-butene.

A comparative study of pristine and thermally treated (medium-temperature reduction, MTR, 573 K, 1h) Pd-graphimet was carried out to establish the changes arising in structure and catalytic activity. The structural investigation was performed by means of BET surface area analysis, transmission electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering and H2 titration. In order to distinguish between the hydrogenation and isomerization sites of the samples, the single turnover reaction of 1-butene was applied. For pristine Pd-graphimet, the experimental evidence confirmed the presence of interlayer metal and surface metal particles of different sizes. Although the catalytic activity was clearly attributable to the 1–2 nm surface Pd crystallites, the interlayer metal content also had an influence on the reaction through deintercalation which first started at 323 K. Nevertheless, the effect of MTR was found to be far more pronounced: all the inserted Pd atoms underwent migration and a moderate sintering of the surface Pd crystallites took place. Data on the transformation of 1-butene indicated that Pd-graphimet was similar in effect to supported Pd catalysts.
