Anatase supported catalyst has exhibited higher ammoxidation activities than rutile supported one and pure ceria. Turnover frequencies calculated from ammoxidation rates and irreversible 02 uptakes in respect to a particular picoline isomer were almost equal for pure supports on one hand and for supported ceria catalysts on the other.

Introduction Research activity is on the increase on the use of ceria in different areas of heterogeneous catalysis [1-6] because of its ability to release and store oxygen, to exist in the redox states of Ce4+ and Ce3+, to form nonstoichiometric oxides under various treatments [7,8] and to be reoxidized to CeO2 upon exposure to oxidizing environment even at ambient temperature. However, ceria has not so far been studied as a selective ammoxidation catalyst for picolines. *Corresponding author. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 .(5~ 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. Pll S0926-860X(97)00 1 28-2 Vanadia-based catalysts are commonly used for partial oxidation and ammoxidation reactions [9]. In the present preliminary investigation ammoxidation of /3- and 7-picolines to nicotinonitrile and isonicotino- nitrile, respectively has been studied on CeO> the two polymorphs of TiO2, rutile and anatase, 20% CeO2/ anatase and 20% CeOz/rutile catalysts. The supported catalysts have exhibited high ammoxidation activities. Low temperature oxygen chemisorption (LTOC) tech- nique developed by Parekh and Weller [10] has been extended for the characterization of the supported ceria catalysts. The ammoxidation products of /3- and 7-picolines are industrially important intermedi- ates for the preparation of drugs and pesticides. Equa- tion of the reaction is shown below:. 124 N~ CH3 + or picoline NH3 + 312 02 P.K. Rao et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 123 127 ~ C N + 3H20 nicotinonitril/ isonicotinonitril 2. Experimental Pure CeO2 was obtained by decomposing ammo- nium ceric nitrate [(NH4)2Ce(NO3)6] at 500 in a furnace for 6 h. Two 20% CeO2/TiO2 catalysts with anatase and rutile (Tioxide, UK) as supports were prepared by impregnation method. First the supports were calcined at 500 in a furnace for 4 h. Exactly l0 g of each dry support was impregnated in 20 ml of ammonium ceric nitrate solution in 9N HNO3 contain- ing 7.96 g of the salt, for l h. The excess water was evaporated on a water bath and the catalyst precursors were dried at 110 in an oven and finally calcined at 500 for 4 h. Activities of these catalysts for ammoxidation of fl- and 7-picolines were determined in a vertical boro- silicate glass reactor (20 mm i.d. and 350 mm length) enclosed in an electrically heated metal block furnace maintained at 410. About 2 g of the catalyst (- 18 to +25 BSS mesh) was packed in the middle of the reactor in between two beds of glass beads. The temperature of the catalyst bed was measured by a thermocouple inserted into thermowell in the catalyst bed and connected to a temperature controller- indicator. The catalyst was prereduced in H2 at 450 for 2 h and then the temperature of the catalyst bed was lowered to 410. A mixture of NH3 and air (mole ratio 11 : 44 was metered from cylinders and passed through the catalyst bed. Picoline solution in water (mole ratio 1 : 13) was then fed to the reactor at a rate of 2 ml/h with the help of a syringe pump. The products collected in a cold trap at the bottom of the reactor were analysed at intervals of 30 min by gas chromatography using OV-17 column (3 mmx3 m). The deviation in estimating the products by GC analysis is <+2%. The BET surface areas and low temperature oxygen chemisorption (LTOC at 195 K) [10] were measured in a conventional glass adsorption apparatus after reducing the catalysts in hydrogen (50 ml rain J) at 450 for 2 h. Oxygen uptakes of CeOz/anatase cata- lysts with different CeO2 loadings were determined to see the applicability of LTOC to characterize the catalysts. 3. Results and discussion The BET surface areas, irreversible 02 uptakes and 02 adsorption site densities, and the picoline conver- sion turnover frequencies (TOFs) of the catalysts are presented in Table 1. Oxygen uptakes are plotted as a function of CeO2 loading on TiO2 (anatase) in Fig. 1. Steady state conversions of picolines and selectivities of their respective nitriles obtained on these catalysts are depicted in Fig. 2.

It is evident from Table 1 that 02 uptakes deter- mined by the double isotherm method increase in the order, rutile<anatase<20% CeO2/rutile<CeO2<20% CeO2/anatase and the 02 adsorption site densities are in the order, anatase<rutile<20% CeO2/ana- tase<20% CeOz/rutile<CeO2. Pure supports, anatase and rutile have shown lower conversions and selectivities than ceria in the ammox- idation of the two picolines. Anatase supported cata- lysts have exhibited the highest activity for ammoxidation of picolines (Fig. 2). The fact that two parallel isotherms are generated on these catalysts by the LTOC technique [10] suggests that Ce4+ ions have been reduced to Ce3+ ions and oxygen is irreversibly adsorbed on oxygen 126 P.K. Rao et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 123-127 vacancies [1,11-13] which are usually referred to as coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) on cations created by the reduction process. On pure supports the CUS may be located on Ti3+ ions obtained by the reduction of Ti4+ ions. It may be assumed that all the CUS are equally active in catalyzing the reaction [14,15]. EPR [12] and FTIR [11,13] studies have shown that adsorbed oxygen exists as 02 and as O2 species on CeO2 catalysts partially reduced in H2 at higher temperatures. Fig. 1 shows that 02 uptakes correlate with CeO2 loading on TiO2 (anatase) in the range 5- 20 wt% studied suggesting that there is a possible interaction between CeO2 and TiO2 (anatase). The 02 uptake on the supports is low, but on pure CeO2 it is quite significant. However, the interacted CeO2 spe- cies have shown higher reducibility as is evident from the LTOC data plotted in Fig. 1 (the 02 uptake is 4-5 times on CeO2FFiO2 (anatase) catalysts if one calcu- lates the uptake per 1 g of CeO2 in the catalysts). From quantitative TPR study [3] it was shown that the first (around 450) of the two peaks is associated with easily reducible surface CeTM to CeIn. Thus the number of irreversibly adsorbed oxygen atoms measured after reduction at 450 may be reasonably assumed to be equal to the number of active sites on the catalysts and the active site densities are calculated from BET surface areas and 02 uptakes. Pure supports have exhibited the highest TOF and the TOF decreases in the order, pure supports>supported ceria cata- lysts>pure ceria. However, pure supports show lower activities on weight basis because of their lower active site densities (Table 1). Deo et al. [ 16] have observed that the higher TOF of V205 catalysts supported on ZrO2, TiO2, and Nb205 for methanol oxidation is not related to the terminal V=O bond strength determined by Laser Raman spectroscopy. They concluded that the higher activity of V2Os/TiO2 and V2Os/Nb205 catalysts should be related to vanadium-oxygen-sup- port (V-O-S) bond strength. Hence the higher TOF of ammoxidation of picolines over CeO2FFiO2 catalysts when compared to pure ceria may also be attributed to a similar facile type of interaction between CeO2 and TiO2 surface as in V2Os/TiO2 catalysts. For all the catalysts, the -y-picoline TOFs are more than twice the -picoline TOFs (Table 1). It is inter- esting to note that the intrinsic activities in respect of a particular isomer are almost equal for pure supports on one hand and for the supported ceria catalysts on the other. From these results it should be inferred that the two structural isomers with methyl group at different positions from nitrogen atom show marked steric effect in catalysis on these materials. ~,-picoline with methyl group farther away from nitrogen is perhaps more favorably activated than /3-picoline on the cat- alyst surface for participation in the reaction. Inter- acted CeO2 species of supported catalysts have shown increased 02 uptakes as well as increased conversions and selectivities in the ammoxidation of fl- and 7-picolines to their corresponding nitriles. Hitherto, it is suggested that irreversible oxygen chemisorption obtained by applying LTOC technique to hydrotreating catalysts [17] and supported V205 catalysts [18] can be related to the general state of dispersion of active phase on the support. The present study (Fig. 1) has shown that LTOC technique can be applied for measuring the CUS on supported ceria which catalyzes ammoxidation reaction. The present investigation has revealed that highly active ammox- idation catalysts can be synthesized by dispersing ceria on suitable supports.
