DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(08)60116-3 Chiral Diamine/Brønsted Acid Conjugates Confined in Mesoporous Silica as Catalyst for the Asymmetric Aldol Reaction LI Hua, LÜ Xiaobing* State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116012, China Abstract: Chiral primary-tertiary diamine/Brønsted acid conjugates were selectively immobilized on the inner surface of mesoporous silica and used as catalyst for the asymmetric aldol reaction of acetone with various aldehydes. The catalyst showed modest reactivity and enan- tioselectivity and can be reused 6 times without loss of activity and enantioselectivity. As compared with silica gel as the support, an in- crease in ee value of the reaction product was observed with the SBA-15-immobilized organic catalyst. This was believed to be due to the confinement effect of the nanopores. Key words: asymmetric catalysis; immobilization; confinement effect; bifunctional catalyst; aldol reaction � The catalytic asymmetric aldol reaction is a highly versatile and powerful C–C bond forming reaction. It is widely used in constructing natural and non-natural products. Some bifunc- tional catalysts that mimic enzymes for the aldol reaction have attracted extensive research activities and development [1–4]. As compared with the well-explored enamine catalysis with secondary amines, Luo et al. [4] reported that a simple chiral primary-tertiary diamine in combination with a Brønsted acid can act as an efficient enamine-based primary amine catalyst. From a practical point of view, it would be desirable to have the catalyst immobilized so that its recovery, reuse, and product purification can be facilitated, especially when the catalyst is obtained by several synthetic steps [5–7]. However, activity and enantioselectivity are often worse when a homogeneous catalyst is heterogenized, which is due to the complex structure of the support, slow diffusion, and other reasons [8]. In the pores of mesoporous materials, the confinement effect may increase or decrease enantioselectivity depending on how the interaction changes the transition states of the chiral products [9]. Here, we report the synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts containing simple chiral primary-tertiary diamine/Brønsted acid conjugates confined in pores by post-grafting chiral trans-N,N-dialkylated diaminocyclohexanes onto mesopor- ous materials. The bifunctional catalysts can effectively catalyze the asymmetric aldol reaction of acetone with vari- ous aldehydes. A confinement effect originating from the mesopores was observed in the SBA-15-immobilized catalyst system. The preparation of catalyst series 11 is shown in Scheme 1. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/Max 3400 powder diffractometer using Cu K . ra- diation (40 kV and 30 mA). Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured at –196 o C on a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 system in the static measurement mode. Solid-state 13 C and 29 Si NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian INOVA-400 spec- trometer. The XRD patterns of all the samples (not shown) showed peaks that can be assigned to the (100), (110), and (200) reflections of ordered SBA-15 structures. This indicates that the support materials remained intact during post-grafting. The N 2 adsorption isotherm of 11d (not shown) was of type . The measurement of the N 2 adsorption isotherm of 11d showed that the anchoring of the organic units on SBA-15 resulted in decreases in the average pore size from 9.25 to 7.56 nm, pore LI Hua et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(7): 587–589 volume from 0.96 to 0.79 ml/g, and BET surface area from 580 to 455 m 2 /g. These results suggest that the immobilization predominantly occurred on the inner surface of the mesoporous materials. The 13 C NMR spectrum of 11d (not shown) exhib- ited a chemical shift at 0, which is characteristic of the carbon that is attached to the silicon atom. The chemical shifts of the carbons of the alkyl carbon and the cyclic CH were observed in the range of 20–24, whereas the carbons of NHCH 2 exhibited chemical shifts in the range of 45–56 [10]. These results show that the organic functional groups were intact after immobili- zation. The 29 Si NMR spectrum of 11d (not shown) exhibited chemical shifts at –70 to –60 characteristic of the silicon that is attached to the carbon atom, which indicates the incorporation of the organic functional groups [11]. These chiral immobilized catalysts were evaluated for the asymmetric aldol reaction of acetone with various aldehydes (Table 1). The N-dialkylated groups in the chiral pri- mary-tertiary diamine/Brønsted acid conjugates had a strong influence on the rate and product enantioselectivity. A low yield of 45% and product ee value less than 5% were observed in the reaction of acetone and p-nitrobenzaldehyde with the use of 11a as catalyst. The long N-dialkylated group seemed to enhance the asymmetric induction and thereby significantly increase the enantioselectivity of the product (Table 1, entries 1–5). The highest enantioselectivity was observed with the system of 11d as the catalyst. These results further show that the appropriate steric hindrance in the chiral primary-tertiary diamine/Brønsted acid conjugate catalyst is crucial to the asymmetric induction in the aldol reaction. For comparison, a heterogeneous catalyst (11f), namely, the chiral primary-tertiary diamine/Brønsted acid conjugates im- mobilized on silica gel, was synthesized and also used for this reaction under the same conditions. The yield and the enanti- oselectivity were clearly lower than those obtained with 11d as the catalyst (Table 1, entries 4 and 6). From the catalytic re- Scheme 1.

LI Hua et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(7): 587–589 sults, the enhancement of the product enantioselectivity for the reaction of acetone and p-nitrobenzaldehyde catalyzed by 11d was attributed to the confinement effect of the nanopores of SBA-15. Unfortunately, compared with the corresponding homogeneous catalyst (Table 1, entry 7), the catalytic per- formance of catalyst 11d decreased after immobilization. Catalyst 11d was shown to be effective in the asymmetric aldol reaction of acetone and various substituted benzaldehydes, and similar enantioselectivities of the corresponding products were achieved under the same conditions (Table 1, entries 8–11). It can be noted that the bifunctional heterogeneous catalyst 11d was easily recovered by simple filtration and was subjected to reuse 6 times without any loss in activity and product enanti- oselectivity (Fig. 1). Based on the concept of dual activation, a proposed transi- tion state model of the aldol reaction catalyzed by the bifunc- tional catalyst is shown in Scheme. 2. In the aldol reaction, the primary amine group is responsible for enamine formation with acetone through hydrogen bonding. The protonated tertiary amine group can activate the carbonyl group of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde by hydrogen bonding [4,7,12]. The Re face of the activated aldehyde is attacked by the enamine, which results in a stable transition state. The structure of the acid site and the confinement effect of the nanopores determine that the Re face of the activated aldehyde is attacked more easily. Therefore, the chiral induction in the aldol reaction was critically influenced by the steric hindrance of acid site. The hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance of the base site can influence the rate of the catalytic reaction. In summary, we have prepared heterogeneous organocata- lysts by covalent grafting of chiral primary-tertiary dia- mine/Brønsted acid conjugates on the inner surface of SBA-15 mesoporous silica whose outer surface was first modified by treating the parent material with PhSi(OMe) 3 . The synthesized catalysts were active in the asymmetric aldol reaction and gave modest yield and enantioselectivity. The aldol reaction cata- lyzed by the chiral primary-tertiary diamine/Brønsted acid conjugates immobilized on SBA-15 gave a higher ee value than that catalyzed by the same organic groups anchored on silica gel. The enhanced enantioselectivity for this reaction was attributed to the confinement effect of the nanopores of SBA-15. However, the activity and enantioselectivity of im- mobilized catalyst were lower than those of the corresponding homogeneous catalyst.
