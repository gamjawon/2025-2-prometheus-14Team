The decreased reaction rate is due to the formation of solid carbamate in the presence of CO 2 . The yield of benzylamine was increased to >94.4% in the presence of CO 2 . The presence of CO 2 could prohibit the formation of dibenzylamine in organic solvents. The acidic nature of H 2 Oâ€“CO 2 benefi ted the elimination of NH 3 .

Fundamental natures and CO oxidation activity were examined. Charges were highly localized in Ag/SiO 2 spheres evidenced by depth-profi ling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Particle size, thermal treat- ment and perimeter play signifi cant roles in the occurrence of catalytic activity. Ag particle size and thermal pretreat- ment determine the CO oxidation performance after 2nd test runs, but not in the 1st test run. Metallic Pd nanoparticles prepared in cross-linked ionic liquid polymer gel. Particle size dependence on styrene hydrogenation activity.

Arbuzov-type metal complexes: on the origin of this promoting effect. Alkyl and aromatic phosphines (PR 3 ) are inhibitors and I 2 act as an antidote. Different coordination chemistry for PPh 3 , P(OPh) 3 and P(OEt) 3 with PtBr 2 . New X-ray structure of trans- [PtBr 2 (PPh 3 )] 2 dimer. A co-polymer of styrene and a bidentate ligand (hydroxy- phenylimidazole) was synthesized. Nanofi bers of the copolymer were fabricated. Oxovanadium(IV) was then incorporated into the nanofi bers through coordination. The catalytic fi bers were successfully applied to the oxidation of thioanisole. The level of vanadium leaching less severe with the bidentate ligand as a vanadyl anchor. Kinetic process for cyclotrimerization of propanal catalyzed by BAILs was investigated. We examined the relationships between catalytic activity and acidity of BAILs. Interactions between propanal molecule and ion pairs of BAILs had been studied by DFT. The stronger of the interaction, the easier for propanal to be activated. CO formed on Pd surface retards the adsorption of phenol. Cyclohexanone is preferentially adsorbed on Pd than CO and water. The leaching of Pd occurs and the potential of Pd surface gradually changes in hot water. The catalyst deactivation occurs rapidly in the presence of both dense phase CO 2 and water.

Cu + oxidation by O 2 and Cu 2+ reduction by benzene represent a catalytic redox cycle. Both, BrÃ¸nsted acid sites and Cu ions are essential, proving bifunctional phenol formation catalysis. The superox- ide ion is the likely intermediate in a radical ionic reac- tion mechanism. ODP reaction on four VO x /TiO 2 catalysts has been studied by DFT methods. Key factors affecting activity: support surface, vanadia loading and active sites. Activity is con- trolled by the oxidizability and bonding ability of active sites. The coexistence of O V= and O Vâ€“Ti sites enhances the catalytic activity. Heterogeneous enantioselective hydrogenation of -dehydroamino acids was achieved. The enantioselectivity approached 46% for alky substituted -dehydroamino acids. The -dehydroamino acids interacted effi ciently with the chiral modifi er. This result offered a new approach to synthesize optical -amino acids. Bi 2 CuO 4 nanoparticles have been synthesized using ultra- sound technique.

I/Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 /TiO 2 exhibits higher activity on photodegradati on of phenol. I 2 /I âˆ’ redox mediator can promote the separation of photogenerated carriers. Formic acid dehydrogenation on M(2 1 1) M = Ni, Pd, Pt was computed. Formate route plays the dominating role. CO 2 has strong chemisorbed adsorption on M(2 1 1). The activity of M(2 1 1) and M(1 1 1) has been compared. A class of simple chiral diamines (4) were designed and synthesized. The copper(II) complexes were efficient catalysts in the asymmetric Henry reaction. Our results show that 4g- Cu(OAc) 2 could be readily recovered and reused.

Inexpensive and enviro-friendly hydrotalcites used for Ullmann homocoupling reaction. The developed protocol does not require any additional base or reducing agent. High yields of biphenyl were obtained in short reaction time under microwave heating. Isolated and easily re- ducible Cu 2+ species were responsible for catalytic activity. Catalysts can be reused at least three cycles without loss activity.

Suzuki-Miyaura reaction was conducted using different heterogeneous catalysts. Differential selectivity changed when different catalysts were used. Correlation between selectivity and pore diameter was found for mesoporous catalysts. The changes of selectivity points to heteroge- neous catalysis mechanism.

Photo-assisted Fe 0 /OA/DO is effective in de- colorization of OII. OII and Cr(VI) can be simultaneously removed in photo-assisted Fe 0 /EDTA/DO. Salen-like and salan-like yttrium silylamido com- plexes have been explored. All complexes were highly active in the ring- opening polymerization of -caprolactone. Good control of macromolecu- lar parameters in the ROP of lactides was shown.
