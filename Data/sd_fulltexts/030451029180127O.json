1 Journal of Molecular Catalysis, 70 (1991) 277-333 277 Review Oxidation of hydrocarbons on transition metal oxide catalysts quantum chemical studies Maigorzata Witko Institute of Catalysis and Surface Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, ul. Niezapominckjek, Cracow 30 239 (Poland) Abstract This review points out the role of quantum chemistry in understanding the mechanism of catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons on transition metal oxides and presents an overview of fundamental experimental information necessary to explain the elementary steps of these reactions. The problem of modelling heterogeneous catalysis is divided into three aspects: nature of the surface, interaction of atoms or molecules with the surface and the nature of the reactions occurring in the absence of catalyst. Each aspect is examined on the basis of the results obtained from quantum chemical calculations. Heterogeneous oxidation of both aliphatic (propene, butene-1) and aromatic (benzene, toluene, o-xylene) hydrocarbons is discussed as an example. Introduction Oxidation of hydrocarbons may be viewed as a reaction which consists in the abstraction of hydrogen atom(s) and addition of one or several oxygen atoms, resulting in several products which differ in the ratios C/H and C/O. Based upon various factors, oxidation reactions can be divided into different classes. One possible classification method is to separate them into selective (partial, soft) oxidation and total oxidation (combustion). Thermodynamically the most favourable are reactions of total oxidation, characterized by the largest changes in free enthalpy, AGO, and the highest O/C ratio in products. Thus, to obtain selective oxidation processes (less oxygen in products), the reaction must be kinetically controlled. This can be achieved either by modifying the reaction conditions or by the use of catalysts. Selective oxidation comprises reactions which proceed with conservation of the number of carbon atoms in the oxidized molecule and reactions which lead to partial degradation of the carbon skeleton. They can be classified into two types: those involving only the dehydrogenation process and those involving both dehydrogenation and oxygen insertion into the hydrocarbon molecule. The dehydrogenation process, which consists of cleavage of a 0304-5102/91/$3.50 0 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 278 C-H bond and formation of a C=C bond, converts the hydrocarbon molecule into a more unsaturated hydrocarbon. It can proceed either as a simple process without oxygen or as a process involving oxygen. In the latter case, formation of water as a byproduct provides the thermodynamic driving force for the dehydrogenation. The main features of the selective oxidation involving both dehydrogenation and oxygen insertion are cleavage of a C-H bond and formation of a C-O bond. Oxygen is required for both steps, viz. in the dehydrogenation step to form water as a byproduct and in the insertion stage to form oxygenates. From the point of view of industrial application, the most important process is selective oxidation by heterogeneous catalysis, which accounts for 21% of the total production of major organic chemicals. The main processes in this category are allylic oxidation to aldehydes, nitriles (in the presence of NH3) and acids, aromatic oxidation to acids and anhydrides, epoxidation of olefins, methanol oxidative dehydrogenation to formaldehyde and, recently of increasing importance, functionalization of paraffins. Among these processes the most significant is allylic oxidation (oxidation at the allylic position) which includes oxidation, ammoxidation, dimerization, oxydehydrogenation and acetoxylation reactions [ 1-3 ]. These processes proceed through formation of the allylic species or its homologues. Further transformations, consisting in the abstraction of the second H atom and/or addition of oxygen or an NH group, lead to formation of dienes, aldehydes, acids or nitriles, respectively. The organic molecule can react with oxygen along many possible reaction pathways, giving a number of different products. The role of the catalyst is to accelerate only one of them, very often not the thermodynamically most favourable one. This selectivity of action is the most important and characteristic feature of the catalyst and makes possible the formation of products, which in the absence of the catalyst would have never been formed because of the more rapidly proceeding competitive processes. Often a small modification of the catalyst composition or variation in the method of its preparation can modify its catalytic properties to such an extent that the direction of the reaction is changed and a new product is formed, usually with high selectivity. Catalysts used in selective oxidation processes are mixed metal oxides which are combination of transition metal oxides of Groups VA and VIA (V20o, Mo03, U03, W03) with oxides of Groups B (Bi, As, Sb, Sn, Te, P) or Group VIII (Fe, Co, Ni). The mixed oxides can form chemical compounds of the type of oxysalts (COMo04, Bi2MO06), solid solutions (Mo03 in V205) or bi-dimensional layers of one oxide deposited on another oxide as support (V205-Ti02). In the total oxidation the simple transition metal oxides (Co304, Mn02) having low valence cations are active. Catalytic properties of a given catalyst, irrespective of whether it is heterogeneous, homogeneous or enzymatic catalysis, are related to the properties of an intermediate complex composed of the reacting molecule and a group of atoms of the catalyst, constituting the active center. Un- 279 derstanding the mechanism of the catalytic process requires answering the following basic questions: - how does bonding of the molecule in the intermediate complex modify the electronic structure of this molecule, in other words what is the structure of the intermediate complex and how does it depend on the properties of the active center? - how does formation of the intermediate complex influence the reactivity of different bonds in the molecule and thus, determine the type of product formed in the course of the catalytic reaction? - where at the surface of the catalyst is the discussed intermediate complex located and to what extent do its properties relate to the localization and to the properties of the solid? - what is the role of the steric factor, i.e. how does the mutual orientation of the reacting molecules affect the type of products? - how do the electronic factors, i.e. type of frontier orbitals of the reacting molecules, determine the reaction pathway and hence the type of products formed? - do there exist any other active centers which can create other routes for parallel or consecutive transformation of the reacting molecule, leading to other unwanted products? Recent developments in modern surface techniques provide access to a wide spectrum of information on both atomic and electronic structures of a surface, its geometry and topography, as well as on the structure of adsorbed species, i.e. their chemical composition, coordination and type of bonds. However, only a limited number of isolated data about catalytic processes have been accumulated, in many cases with only slight interrelations among them. Understanding of the mechanisms of catalytic reactions is still far from satisfactory. Rapid advances in methodology and computational power allow computational chemistry to provide information which is difficult to obtain experimentally and to assist in the interpretation and understanding of experimental results. Developments in computers and their increasingly widespread availability have resulted in the emergence of quantum chemistry as a new tool in the studies of catalytic processes. Since quantum chemistry can provide fundamental insight into the elementary steps of a reaction, its methods become a strategy which is parallel and complementary to experimental techniques. The synergy between experiment and quantum chemistry may lead to better understanding of the nature of catalytic processes. The application of quantum chemistry to the problems of catalysis has been the subject of several review articles. Beran and Zahradnik [41 summarize all applications of different quantum chemical methods to catalytic problems up to 1977. Sauer [5j gives a short review of relevant approximations and techniques, as well as their use in the description of molecular and ionic crystals, semiconductors and insulators, zeolites, silica, and related materials. A general treatment of the modern theory of catalysis by solid surfaces is given in [61, whereas use of the molecular cluster approach to investigate 280 a number of solid state problems and the interaction of these surfaces with adsorbates is presented in [ 7 ]. Baetzold [ 8 ] concentrates on application of MO (Molecular Orbital) theory to the description of the properties of metal clusters and chemisorption of simple species on them. The theoretical aspects of metal clusters are discussed in detail by Koutecky and Fantucci [9], who consider alkali metal and alkaline-earth metal as well as transition metal clusters, attention being paid to the electronic structure and geometry of clusters of different sizes. Discussion of HF (Hartree Fock) and CI (Configuration Interaction) methods, density functional theories and effective potential methods is also presented. The phenomenon of chemisorption is discussed by Shustorovich [10] in terms of the PT-BOC (Perturbation Theory-Bond Order Conservation) method, which is based on analysis of some fundamental aspects of chemisorption such as periodic trends in heat of chemisorption and acceptor behavior of adsorbates. Quantum chemical aspects of chemical bonding to metal surfaces by means of Frontier Orbital Theory are investigated by van Santen in [ 111. More general in the sense of dealing not only with the metal catalysts are the papers of Colbourn [ 12 ] and van Hove et al. [131. The former concentrates on adsorption and reaction on clusters of metals, ionic and covalent materials as well as on their surface structure and stability. Problems of poisoning and promotion are also discussed and a review of theoretical studies on zeolites is given. Van Hove et al. [ 13 ] describe several methods of theoretical surface chemistry, stressing their significant contribution to the understanding of surface structural chemistry. Additionally they provide information on the various experimental techniques that are used and the types of structural information obtained. Hoffmann [ 14 ], in an excellent and very illustrative manner demonstrates how to link chemistry and physics by giving an interpretation of delocalized band structure from a chemical point of view. This paper can serve as one of the few common bases between chemists and physicists and between their specific languages. Theoretical studies on zeolites, including structural simulation, cation localization, zeolite acidity, the influence of electrostatic effect upon the structure and properties as well as on adsorption on zeolites, are presented in [ 15 ]. The impact of quantum chemistry on studies of the mechanism of chemical reactions is summarized by Jug [ 16 ] and by Friedrich et al. [ 17 ], who give a brief survey of existing MO theories applied to the question of chemical reaction [ 16 ] and the outline of dynamic and static approaches to the theoretical studies of reaction mechanisms. The aim of the article, addressed to both theoreticians and experimentalists, is to give an overview of fundamental experimental information required to understand the mechanism of catalytic heterogeneous oxidation of hydrocarbons on transition metal oxide catalysts and to present the role of quantum chemical methods in the explanation of elementary steps of these reactions. Since in modelling heterogeneous catalysis it is convenient to subdivide the problem into three aspects, viz. the nature of the surface, interaction of atoms or molecules with the surface and nature of the reactions 281 occurring in the absence of catalyst, this paper includes discussion of the activation step of both reacting molecules, a description of the catalysts and studies of the direct reaction between different oxygen species and various forms of the molecule to be oxidized. The paper is based upon studies carried out by the author using quantum chemistry methods and upon selected information from the literature. Interaction of reactants with the surface of the catalyst Chemisorption, the chemical binding of an atom or molecule (adsorbate) to a solid surface (adsorbent or substrate), is one of the steps in the process of heterogeneous catalysis. Theory of chemisorption can provide energy hypersurfaces E(R) as well as a description of the electronic structure of the bond between the adsorbate and adsorption site on the surface, and therefore stands between solid state theory and the theory of molecules. The solid provides a surface with many adsorption sites, an infinite reservoir of electrons with constant chemical potential, and continuum of excited states. Chemisorption of molecules leads to the appearance of a discrete resonance structure of the excitation spectrum. During chemisorption the discrete states of the isolated molecule are coupled to the continuum of the solid leading usually to a shift and broadening of the molecular states. Theoretical approaches to the description of chemisorption are reviewed in the monograph [ 18 ], in which chemisorption on oxides, semiconductors and both simple and transition metals is discussed and solid surfaces as well as clusters are considered. The existing theoretical approaches are briefly reviewed also by Muscat and Newns [19] (examples of chemisorption of hydrogen, oxygen, alkalies on transition metals) and by Schonhammer [20] (chemisorption of hydrogen on metals). The general features of the LCAO MO, Green's function formalism, multiple-scattering Xa methods, their applications to chemisorption with emphasis on the localization of bonding in surface complexes are given by Danese and Schrieffer [21 ]. Activation of oxygen In oxidation reactions two reactants take part: oxygen species and the molecule to be oxidized. FYom the point of view of thermodynamics practically all organic compounds are not stable with respect to oxygen. The fact that at normal temperature only few chemical . compounds react spontaneously with oxygen is due to the high bond energy in the oxygen molecule, which is responsible for the significant activation energy of uncatalyzed oxidation reaction. One of the most important functions of a catalyst in the oxidation process is the activation of oxygen by its adsorption and/or incorporation into the 282 oxide crystal lattice. One should not forget that the surface oxygen atoms of the oxide may also participate in the catalytic reaction. In order to understand catalytic oxidation it is essential to study the behaviour and properties of oxygen adsorbed on the catalyst as well as the nature of the surface oxygen atoms. The nature and properties of adsorbed and surface oxygen atoms are usually characterized by one of the following features: - bond energy M-O or related parameters (heat of adsorption or desorption, heat of decomposition of oxide) as well as kinetic properties (for example isotope exchange energy); - charge of oxygen species; - structure of M-O complexes (both those forming on the surface and those constituting the structure of oxide). Results of the experimental studies indicate that catalysts for selective and total oxidation processes differ in the bond energy of the oxygen. Catalysts active in total oxidation are characterized by weakly bonded oxygen on the surface or in the bulk, whereas in the case of catalysts for selective oxidation the bond energy of oxygen is much higher. At the catalyst surface oxygen can be present in a continuous range of species, from electron-deficient to electron-rich, from mono- to poly-oxygen species depending on the sample history. These oxygen atoms and ions may have charges and binding energies different from those of the lattice oxygen and may be desorbed at different temperatures. Adsorbed oxygen is identifiable only on the stoichiometric surface of a fully oxidized oxide. On the partially reduced surface reoxidation of the surface cations proceeds, the degree of reoxidation depending on the extent of charge transfer between the reduced center and the adsorbed oxygen. If an adsorbed oxygen species acquires, due to charge transfer, the same electron density as the surface lattice oxygen ion and if it occupies a lattice site - the adsorbed oxygen becomes a lattice oxygen and the surface is reoxidized. Thus, one can consider oxygen as adsorbed only if the charge transfer is less extensive and/or the oxygen species does not occupy the site of lattice oxygen. The occurrence and identification of oxygen species adsorbed at oxide surfaces is reviewed in two papers by Che and Tench [22, 23] and also in the book by Bielanski and Haber [24]. Here, only the main features of the surface oxygen species will be summarized. Two types of monooxygen species may be distinguished: O- ions formed either by adsorption or from surface oxide ions of the lattice and OZ- ions of the lattice in low coordination (LC) and/or double bonded to transition metal ions, M=O. Occurrence of very reactive O- ion even at low temperatures is well established. The formation of its aggregates, such as dimers or trimers, is also suggested. The OZ- ion which in the gas phase is not stable (positive enthalpy of formation), can be stabilized at the surface by interaction with neighbouring ions. The stabilizing Madelung potential depends on the coordination number of the discussed ion, and at surfaces, edges, corners or any defects, is weaker than in the bulk. The consequences are manifested by lowering the energy of such ions and their tendency either to undergo 283 transformation into an O- ion by release of an electron or to become the donor of the electron pair in the presence of an electrophilic moiety. The existence of these low coordination ions at the surface is postulated but not yet proven. Another type of 02- ion exists, where ions are double bonded to metal centers, M=O. In contrast to oxygen ions common to at least two M-O polyhedra, i.e. to oxygen bonded to metal atoms in a chain, M-O-M, double bonded oxygens occupy terminal positions in polyhedra, being bonded exclusively to one metal ion. The difference with previously discussed oxygen ions follows from the weakly polarized M=O bond. Evidence for the existence of M=O species on the surface is very strong. The 02- ions, although having no oxidizing properties, play a crucial role in the oxidation reaction. They can act either as nucleophilic ligands entering into the reagent molecule or can accept protons abstracted during the adsorption of hydrocarbons. When discussing dioxygen species on the surface, superoxide 02- and peroxide 022- ions as well as reversibly bonded oxygen molecules [25] are to be taken into consideration. So far there is no evidence for the presence of the 023- and 02+ species on the surface; however these ions are postulated in the literature. For example compounds containing 02+ ions are known but the formation of such adsorbed species is very unlikely because the oxidation of neutral dioxygen proceeds only in presence of the strongest oxidation reactants. The presence of triplet molecular oxygen adsorbed reversibly is generally accepted. The formation of more reactive, activated singlet molecular oxygen is suggested but the evidence for its existence is indirect. The superoxide ion 02- is the most stable oxygen moiety in the gas phase and it is also present in superoxides of alkali metals. Its occurrence at the surface is well established. Unstable in the gas phase, 022- ion can exist in the solid due to the crystal field stabilizing effect. The 02- and 022ions are unstable at higher temperature and decompose, most probably forming O-. One can also discuss polyoxygen species like 03- and 04- ions. The existence of ozonide ion 03-, containing three equivalent oxygens, which decomposes at room temperature to form 02- ion is documented. There is also supposition about another 03- species with different characteristics (two equivalent nuclei). The data for 04- ion indicate that it is likely to exist on surfaces under special conditions. In summary, oxygen is always chemisorbed in the form of negatively charged species linked to a surface by a bond of a high degree of ionicity. There are no available thermodynamic data concerning the energy of formation of surface oxygen species. With the exception of 022- and 02-, all other negative mono- and poly-nuclear oxygen species are paramagnetic and may be investigated by the EPR method, which in fact is the most important tool for studying the properties of oxygen species. The properties of surface oxygen species depend strongly on the nature of the oxide and on the reaction conditions; they cannot therefore be discussed as entities separate 284 from the environment. Many oxides generate at their surfaces a wide spectrum of various oxygen moieties depending on the reaction conditions. In the oxidation reaction, oxygen can be involved in the following elementary processes: abstraction of hydrogen or proton from an adsorbed organic molecule to give a radical or carboanion; attack on an organic molecule; and the reoxidation process, i.e. replenishment of a lattice oxygen ion. For example, in the case of oxide catalysts hydrogen abstraction, particularly fast with O- ion, takes place also with OLc2-, 02- and 03ions. The O- ion may appear as an intermediate in the reduction as well as in the reoxidation of the surface of the oxide catalyst and may also take part in a direct reaction with other reagents [26]. The essential role of the double-bonded M=O ions in the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons was postulated by Trifiro et al. [27, 28] for the oxidation of propylene and by Akimoto et al. [29-31 ] in the case of butadiene oxidation. The form of the particular oxygen species taking part in a specific oxidation reaction is still far from being established. In various oxidation processes, different oxygen species can participate depending on the type of process (i.e. type of organic molecule and type of catalyst). The various types of oxygen species can be also classified into electrophilic (neutral singlet 02, 02-, O-) and nucleophilic (02-, 022-) agents [32]. Consequently, the oxidation processes may be divided into electrophilic oxidation starting with preliminary activation of the oxygen species, and nucleophilic oxidation beginning with preliminary activation of the hydrocarbon molecule. - Electrophilic oxygen species attack organic molecules in the region of highest electron density, the ar bonds. The reaction results either in the formation of peroxy- and epoxy-complexes which can play the role of precursors of organic oxides (the case of reaction in liquid phase) or in the formation of an intermediate which, under conditions of heterogeneous catalytic reaction, undergoes degradation of the carbon skeleton. Results of experiments [33] indicate that whenever electrophilic species exist at the surface of the catalyst, hydrocarbons undergo total oxidation. This is due to the fact that the attack of electrophilic oxygen is much faster than the insertion of nucleophilic oxygen. - The nucleophilic oxygen species, 02- or 022-, have no oxidizing properties but can be inserted into activated hydrocarbon molecules in the course of nucleophilic addition. Such reactions lead to the formation of oxygenated products which desorb leaving oxygen vacancies at the surface of the catalyst. In the case of nucleophilic oxidation it is the cation of the catalyst which acts as oxidizing agent and forms the activated hydrocarbon species (via abstraction of hydrogen), which undergoes nucleophilic attack by oxygen ions. Hydrogen abstraction and nucleophilic addition of oxygen require different active centers. Incorporation of oxygen from the gas phase to fill oxygen vacancies and to reoxidize the reduced cations may not take place at the same site from which surface oxygen is inserted into the hydrocarbon, oxygen then being transported through the lattice. 285 Both types of oxidation reactions may be further systematized according to the number of elementary structural transformations introduced into the reacting molecule [34]. Along the electrophilic route the smallest structural changes consist in the destruction of double bonds via addition of oxygen (oxidation of olefins into oxides, oxyhydration of olefins to saturated ketones). More significant structural change is the fission of the double bond resulting in formation of saturated aldehydes (in the case of olefin oxidation) or anhydrides (in the case of aromatics where the ring structure undergoes fission). The most severe structural transformation introduced into the reacting molecule by electrophilic oxygen is complete destruction of the carbon skeleton, i.e. combustion into COZ and H20. Along the nucleophilic route the mildest structural change consists in the abstraction of hydrogen atoms (oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkenes into dienes, oxidative dehydrodimerization or dehydrocyclization). More pronounced structural changes are involved when oxygen is incorporated via nucleophilic addition into the organic molecule, either into the hydrocarbon chain (oxidation of alkenes into unsaturated aldehydes or ketones) or into the acyl group (oxidation of aldehydes or ketones). The addition of an oxygen atom into the acyl group is equivalent to the incorporation of the second oxygen into the organic molecule and results in the formation of acids (oxidation of aldehydes) or anhydrides (oxidation of alkyl aromatics). It should be remembered that nitrogen can also play a role of heteroatom and can be introduced into organic molecule in the ammoxidation reaction. In the literature there is no theoretical study devoted explicitly to the problem of chemisorption of dioxygen or oxygen species on the surface of transition metal oxides, although a few papers deal indirectly with this subject. There is a group of papers studying the electronic structure of the metal-dioxygen units in order to understand the nature of Me-02 bonding. The majority of articles, however, summarize the investigation of Me-O interactions and postulate that they can serve as a first approximation of oxygen chemisorption. In order to study the Me-Oz interaction usually two types of models for the bonding of dioxygen to catalytic system are considered: O Me- 0~ end-on Me/ I side-on 0 superoxo \\0 peroxo The electronic structure of such metal-dioxygen species is a subject of interest for several reasons: biological significance of oxygen-carrying species (proteins, hemoglobin, etc.), importance in homo- and heterogeneously catalyzed oxidation reactions, and in technological and industrial processes (corrosion, semiconductors, etc). Investigations on the interactions in the systems Fe-02 [35], Ni-Oz [36], Ti-02 [37], Ag-OZ [381, CO-02 [391 as well as the paper of Lever 286 and Gray [40] concerning the electronic spectra of this type of complex can be listed as examples of studies on Me-OZ bonding properties. Results of the calculations on Me-Oz interactions lead to the following conclusions: binding of one dioxygen molecule to a single atom or ion yields a ground state in which either one or two electrons are transferred into the -rr* orbital of the OZ unit; back donation of charge from the Me atom into the a orbitals on oxygen weakens the O-O bond in coordinated 02; the structure of the Me-OZ complex depends on the charge on the Me atom; the dissociation of OZ on a single atom is a rather unlikely process. There are also studies concerning the nature of Me-02 bonds in presence of other ligands, namely, molecular orbital calculations carried out for metaldioxygen complexes such as Me(CN)50z or Me(NH3)b02 where Me= Mn, Fe, Co, Cu (see for example [41-43]). The results of these calculations can be summarized as follows: - the coordinated dioxygen plays the role of -rr acceptor and due to coordination it is activated by increasing the O-O bond distance; - the activation depends on the electronic and geometrical factors, e.g. on the type of central atom, its formal oxidation number and multiplicity, on the traps effect of the axial ligand and the cis influence of the equatorial plane of ligands. Most theoretical investigations regard the nature of the bond in the diatomic Me-O molecule as a preliminary step for the study of chemisorption of oxygen on metal. Papers covering this subject are reviewed in a section below devoted to transition metal oxides. Numerous articles discuss on-top or hollow-site chemisorption of oxygen on metal surfaces using a cluster model composed of several metal atoms and oxygen as adatom (see for example a series of papers by Tsukada et al. [44, 45]. These calculations stress the important role of metal d-orbitals in the formation of chemisorption bonds with iron-group transition metal surfaces. Due to the directional character of the d wavefunctions the geometry of the chemisorption site significantly influences bond strength and charge distribution. With increase of atomic number the d states are shifted to deeper energy positions and the contribution of the d states to the chemisorption bond decreases. Concerning chemisorption of oxygen on transition metal oxides, the papers by Tsukada and coworkers [44, 46] are the only examples. It was found that oxygen is strongly chemisorbed only onto the cation adjacent to an oxygen vacancy and on surfaces of polar character. Activation of hydrocarbon The adsorption and activation of hydrocarbon molecules on the surface of the oxidation catalyst is at least as important as the adsorption and activation of oxygen. Due to the various types of hydrocarbons and their individual characteristics, a general picture of these processes is difficult to obtain. 287 The extent of metal-hydrocarbon bonding derives from two interdependent components: o, interaction resulting from the overlapping between the HOMO orbital of the hydrocarbon and metal d orbitals of the acceptor type, and 7r interaction from the donation of electrons from filled metal d orbitals of 7r symmetry into LUMO of the hydrocarbon. There are a number of papers devoted to the general mechanism of oxidative conversion of hydrocarbons. Among them the review by Dabyburjor et al. [471, dealing with the `localized' view of the selective oxidation process and the review by Dixon et al. [48] concerning mainly the `delocalized' aspects of this process may serve as examples. The reaction path leading to partial oxidation consists of a series of separate elementary transformations of the reacting molecule and formation of different intermediate complexes [49-51 ]. In the case of the oxidation of olefins, the following steps are postulated: - activation of the olefin molecule, consisting of the abstraction of hydrogen from an a position with respect to the C=C double bond and formation of 7r-bonded allylic species. With catalysts such as molybdates, tungstates etc., the activation step is believed to proceed on cationic active centers which involve oxygen polyhedra of cations such as Bi3+, C02 ', Ni2+ etc. When no other centers are available at the surface, the 7r-allyl species recombine into diene dimers or form polyenes by repetition of the first step on cationic active centers. The process is favoured when the terminal carbon atoms of the activated species are neutral. - the nucleophilic attack of oxygen on the allylic species which is facilitated when positive charge is concentrated on the terminal carbon atoms of allylic species. Oxygen polyhedra of molybdenum, tungsten etc., are assumed to be responsible for the generation of centers on which the 7r-allylic species are transformed into species o- bonded to lattice oxygen ions. The oxygenated intermediate may desorb in the form of aldehyde leaving an oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface. - the insertion of the second oxygen atom into the organic molecule leading to carboxylate intermediates which desorb in the form of acids or anhydrides. The reaction network for the allylic oxidation of propylene following from the investigations of the mechanism of this process on oxide catalyst (see for example [52-54]) is shown in Mg. 1. The first step of the oxidation process, e.g. the abstraction of Ha and formation of a symmetric (but not a cyclic) allylic species with both terminal carbon atoms of equal probability of conversion into the carbonyl group of acrolein, was confirmed by several authors using labelled propylene (e.g. the results of Adams and Sachtler [55-571. Direct evidence of the generation of allylic species as intermediate was also provided by IR spectra of propylene adsorbed on catalysts for partial and total oxidation [58-60]. The allylic intermediate reacts further with lattice oxygen of the catalyst to form acrolein (or in the presence of ammonia to form acrylonitrile). The results of the experiments based upon the idea of by-passing the first determining step of the reaction by generating the allyl radical in situ in a catalytic route proposed by Grzybowska et al. 288 CH 2=CHCH3 - Ha first hydrogen abstraction on transition metal cation dimerization CH 2-CH-CH2 + CH 2-CH-CH2 _ _> CH 2=CH-CH2-CH2_CH=CH 2 02_ Men+02_ 02_ Men+02_ + 02 first nucleophilic addition - Ha second hydrogen abstraction O 022Mo6+~- 022-Mo4+ + 02 second nucleophilic insertion on acid-base centers O CH 2-pl_ _p ____________________________> CH 2=CH-C\\ OH 22 02 Mob+ 02MO 4+ CH 2=CH-CH3.

The reaction network for allylic oxidation of propylene and products of propylene oxidation on various catalysts. [61 ] and further by Burrington and Grasselli [62], pointed out the possibility of the partition of the centers of the catalyst into two classes: that responsible for the activation of propylene, and that involved in the insertion of oxygen. In order to gain further information concerning the properties of the active centers of oxide catalysts which are required for the activation of the olefin molecule, SINDO [63-65] calculations of the interaction of propylene with the surface of the catalyst were carried out [66]. A Madelung correction of the lattice was taken into account. As a model of intermediate surface species, a complex consisting of metal ion (Co or Mg) surrounded by five 289 oxygen ions and the propylene molecule as the sixth ligand was assumed. Figure 2 summarizes four different possibilities of the propylene adsorption which were taken into consideration. The results of the calculations performed for Coo are presented in Fig. 3.

As the propylene approaches the cobalt oxide surface the total energy of the system decreases (an attractive interaction takes place) and reaches a minimum associated with the formation of a stable intermediate complex. The removal of allylic species is energetically more favourable than the removal of a propylene molecule. In Fig. 3b the semiquantitative measure of the energies of C-H and O-H bonds as well as the difference 0=EOH-ECH (the measure of the reaction energy) as functions of the distance propylene-cobalt ion are plotted. When a propylene molecule approaches the cobalt oxide surface, the C-H bond is continuously destabilized, whereas the strength of the O-H bond increases and reaches a maximum at a distance of ca. 2.1 A, i.e. before the most stable adsorptive complex is formed at distance of 1.95 A. On removing the allyl species, the O-H bond is further stabilized up to the energy value characteristic for the O-H bond in (H30)+. In Fig. 4 the results of similar calculations performed for the case of magnesium oxide are shown. When a propylene molecule approaches the surface of MgO the total energy of the system increases, indicating that no intermediate complex is being formed (Fig. 4a). There is a slight stabilization of the O-H bond, but since the C-H bond remains practically unchanged, the curve representing the effect of the reaction (curve III) is not the lowest and the stabilizing effect is compensated by the significant loss of energy by the system. - ETOT [eV ] 2554 2562 25,0 EOH~ [eV] 6 -B -10 ECH 1.65 1.85 2.05 2.25 1.65 1.85 2.05 2.25 (a) R 141 (b) R [ssl Fig. 4.

[@VI 0 -1 F -2 -3 291 It may be thus concluded that on contacting the propylene with the surface of COO the propylene molecule is activated by Ha abstraction, dissociative adsorption takes place and a 7r-allyl intermediate is formed. Contrary to COO, magnesium oxide is not a catalyst for the activation of propylene. It is noteworthy that in the case of COO, during approach of propylene to the surface and removal of allyl from the surface, the charge on the moving hydrogen atom remains almost constant and positive. This suggests that the movement of hydrogen is composed of two steps: transfer of proton from the olefin to the surface oxygen ion: CH2=CH-CH2-H +O(3)2--) [CHz=CH=CHZ]-+OH- (an acid-base reaction) and the transfer of electron from the adsorbed allyl to the metal cation of the catalyst: [CH2=CH=CHZ]-+2M\"+-> [CHZ-CH-CH2]++2M(\"-1)+ (a redox reaction) in order to render the allylic species positive and susceptible to the nucleophilic attack of oxygen. Therefore, the catalyst, in order to activate the hydrocarbon molecule for further oxidation, should perform both functions: acid-base and redox. The stated two stages proceed as one concerted reaction of mixed redox and acid-base character. The second step of the selective oxidation of propylene consists of a nucleophilic attack of lattice oxygen ion on the allylic species. Results of pulse reactor measurements employing a series of isostructural compounds, i.e. a-COMo04, NiM004, MnMo04, MgM004 [67], show that COM004 and NiM004 have a high activity and good selectivity, MnMOM4 is selective but less active whereas MgMOO4 is almost completely inactive, its activity being comparable to that of M003. Since the arrangement of Mo-O polyhedra in all these compounds is identical, the observed differences in the catalytic properties can be attributed only to the different abilities of the metal ions to activate propylene and to bond 7r-allyl as ligand. In order to ascertain the relevant properties of various cations associated with their ability not only to activate the olefin molecule but also to stabilize 7r-allyl complexes, quantum chemical calculations were carried out [68] for 7r-allyl complexes of Co, Ni, Mn, Mg, Fe, and Mo formed as initial intermediates in the selective oxidation. The calculations were performed by means of the SCCC MO method [69-72]. Figure 5 presents the arrangement of atoms at the (001) surface of a COM004 which was used as an example [73]. The crystal structure is built of infinite blocks of two edge-linked Co octahedra linked together by Mo tetrahedra. The 7r-allyl radical bonded to the Co ion is shown schematically. For the calculations complexes of Ch symmetry were assumed, five of the ligands being lattice oxygen ions, the sixth one a 7r-allyl radical. The results of the calculations, which axe summarized in Table 1, indicate that at the surface low spin complexes are formed (lower orbital energies in all studied 292 ~O n O Fig. 5.

In the case of the complexes with Co2+ and Ni2+ bonding and stabilization of the 7r-allyl ligand takes place, 1 - 1.6 of the allyl -rr electrons are shifted to the metal atom. The positive charge is mainly concentrated on the terminal atoms of the allyl ligand, which may facilitate the nucleophilic attack of the lattice oxygen ion, resulting in the formation of an oxygenated complex as a precursor of acrolein. In the case of the Mg2+ complex the allyl remains practically neutral, indicating a very weak bonding effect. Such a situation is more conductive to dimerization. The results of the calculations lead to the conclusion that a fundamental feature on the catalyst cation to perform a role of active center in the first step of the oxidation process is its ability to bond -rr allyl. The subsequent step of the reaction which is nucleophilic attack of lattice oxygen on the allyl species results in the formation of a new intermediate complex of alkoxide character [61, 741: 293 ------------ CH2- CH- CHz ---0 CI-12= CH- CH2 02- Me, O2- 02- Met O- Such complexes were detected by IR measurements [ 751 for the oxidation of propylene on molybdate catalyst. In order to continue the reaction, this complex must dissociate, with the desorption of an oxygenated organic molecule which is connected with the removal of an oxygen atom from the lattice [ 761. Nucleophilic addition of oxygen into the allylic intermediate proceeds via the formation of a o, bond between lattice oxygen and allyl 7r-bonded to the metal cation. In order to desorb in the form of aldehyde, such oxygenated species must abstract a hydrogen atom bonded to the carbon atom of the C=O group. Two mechanisms may operate: (i) abstraction of the second H atom followed by addition of oxygen (ii) addition of oxygen into the allylic species and the subsequent abstraction of hydrogen: _____________ CH -CH=CH2 +0 0 O=CH-CH=CH2 CH2-CH-CHZ +o O2--CH2-CH=CH2 --H 11 O=CH-CH=CHZ Studies of '$O and 'D-labelled allyl alcohols [771 provide information concerning the mechanism. The results indicate that the first step involving dissociative chemisorption with abstraction of HQ and formation of 7r-allyl species bonded to Me, is followed by nucleophilic attack of the bridging oxygen ion. The oxygenated intermediate is bonded via a o, bond to oxygen as an allyl alkoxide. Next, the concerted process takes place resulting in the splitting of allylic hydrogen of allyl alkoxide by another oxygen, desorption of aldehyde and generation of an oxygen vacancy and an OH group. Dehydroxylation re-establishes one of the Me,-O-Met bridges, generating another vacancy which reacts with gaseous oxygen. The third step of the partial oxidation reaction is equivalent to the insertion of the second oxygen atom into the organic molecule. Desorption of such oxygenated species leads to the formation of an acid or anhydride molecule, depending on whether aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon is oxidized. From the experimental data it is evident that the transformation of an aldehyde group into a carboxylic group requires a special type of active center to be present at the surface of the catalyst. The oxidation of propylene on catalysts such as bismuth molybdate or tin antimonate leads to the formation of acrolein, whereas on nickel or cobalt molybdates acrolein and acrylic acid are formed, in different proportions depending on the condition of experiment. The same is true in the case of the oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons. For example, the same catalysts are responsible for the oxidation of o-xylene into tolualdehyde as for the oxidation of propylene into acrolein [ 781. Thus, the further transformation of aldehyde group, i.e. formation of acrylic acid 294 in the oxidation of propylene or phthalic anhydride in the oxidation of oxylene, proceeds on the same catalysts irrespective of the type of organic molecule. Among the catalysts responsible for the oxidation of aldehyde group, cobalt complexes are known as very effective catalysts in homo- and heterogeneous processes. In the homogeneous reaction the role of Co\" complexes (in which Co ion is linked to oxygen atoms via octahedral coordination) consists of the generation of radicals according to the scheme [79J: CHZ=CH-CHO+Co3+--> CH2=CH-CO'+2Co2++H+ The interaction of these radicals with oxygen results in the formation of peracid which transform into peracid molecules. Acceleration of the decomposition of peracid molecules is the second function of Co complexes. In catalysts involved in the heterogeneous reaction, the cobalt ion is also surrounded by oxygen ions in an octahedral arrangement and the experimental data. indicate the surface cobalt ions to be the active centers. This analogy between homo- and heterogeneous reactions suggests that the molecular mechanism of this step of the oxidation process should account for the activity of the isolated cobalt complex (the case of homogeneous reaction) as well as for the cluster comprising the elements of the crystal lattice (the heterogeneous process). In order to explain the mechanism of catalytic action of cobalt ions octahedrally coordinated to oxygen in the transformation of acrolein into acrylic acid, quantum chemical calculations by means of the SINDO method were carried out [80]. The calculations were performed for a series of complexes composed of di- and trivalent cobalt ions linked to five water molecules. Acrolein coordinated to cobalt in four different manners was considered as the sixth ligand (Fig. 6). The results of the calculations point to the complexes with acrolein coordinated perpendicularly to the basal plane c i ,c o x C~'c-o 1. b _o 'C _c C-o _r\"CI./~ -r' 1:0V 3. 4. Fig. 6. Models for acrolein adsorption. 295 of the octahedron (model 1) as the most stable. From among the three structures with acrolein bonded parallel to that plane, the most stable is model 2 in which acrolein is bonded to the cobalt ion via a C=C double bond. Generally, the low spin complexes are more stable than the high spin complexes. In addition to the diatomic contributions to the total energy which can serve as a measure of the bond energy, the interaction of a given atom A in acrolein with all other atoms B within the molecule: IA= E EAB s was also calculated in order to obtain more representative conclusions concerning the possible transformation of bonds within the coordination sphere of the complex. Table 2 summarizes appropriate diatomic energy contributions as well as the interaction energy of selected H atoms. The data indicate that Ha, which is involved in the catalytic transformation of acrolein into the acid, is strongly destabilized on coordination of acrolein to the Co3+. In all lowspin complexes of Co\" the C-H bond is rather stabilized. This indicates that Co\" ions perform the role of active centers in the catalytic oxidation of acrolein into acrylic acid. Both hydrogen and carbon atoms from the aldehyde group interact strongly with the planar oxygen atom situated as the nearest neighbour to the aldehyde group leading to the destabilization of the Co-O bond. Taking into account the destabilizing effect on Ha after coordination of acrolein, as well as the strong interaction between this hydrogen and the oxygen ligand, one may expect the cleavage of the C-H bond, formation of an O-H bond and then bonding of OH group to the Co ion. These interactions will result in the weakening of the Co-O bond.

Such a concerted reaction is equivalent to the insertion of oxygen into C-H bond of the aldehyde group. In the literature most theoretical studies concentrate on investigation of the electronic structure of the catalyst surface. Only a few papers are devoted to the interaction of hydrocarbon molecules with the surface of metal oxide catalysts. The knowledge of the nature of the bond between surface and adsorbed hydrocarbon molecule, and of the consequences of such bond formation on the electronic structure of both adsorbed molecule and active center is rather limited. The possible role of metal alkyl, metal alkylidene and metal alkylidene intermediates in the mechanism of catalytic reactions draws attention to the metal-carbon bond as being of particular interest in both homo- and heterogeneous catalysis. The precise character of the Me-C bond is a subject of several papers regarding the following systems: NiCH2 and NiCH3 (Generalized Valence Bond+ CI treatment) [81], MnCH2+ and CrCH2+ (ab initio [82] and GVB technique [83]), RuCH2+ (GVB) [84], CrCHz+ and RuCH2+ (GVB) [85], CuCHz+ (CIPSI) [86]. All these papers concern the electronic structure and bonding characteristics, e.g. equilibrium geometry (bond length, bond angle) and bond dissociation energy. There are a number of papers devoted to the interaction of metallic centers with the hydrocarbon molecule. Johnson and Messmer [871 discuss by means of the SCF Xa SW method the Me -C2H4 complexes as prototypes of reaction intermediates formed in both homo- and heterogeneous catalysis. They point to a profound effect of the surrounding environment (addition of more metal atoms or addition of nonmetal atoms to the studied complex) on the Me-C2H4 bonding which, in turn, influences catalytic activity and selectivity. The ethylene-metal bond in complexes between Cu+, Ag+, Au' and CZH4 were also investigated in [88] (HFS technique based on transition state method) and in [89] (SCF Xa). The contribution from o' donation to the bonding energy was found to be equally important for all complexes, whereas the contribution from 7r back donation only for the Cu complex. Discussion of the factors which decide the geometrical coordination of ethylene in PtCl3C2H4 (steric factors) and Pt(PH3)ZCZH4 (electronic factors 7r-donation) is also included. Calculations concerning the electronic structure and bond properties of metal-ethylene complexes were also carried out by CAS SCF CI (Complete Active Space) for FeC2H4 [90] and Ni2C2H4 [91], by GVB CI treatment for NiC2H4 and Ni2C2H4 [92] and by ab initio method for AgC2H4+ [93]. The formation of new bonds occurring via reductive elimination reactions and breaking of bonds via oxidative addition reactions was studied in the example of the elimination and addition reactions of methane and ethane with nickel by ab initio+ contracted CI treatment [94]. Upton and Goddard [95] discussed the degree to which the ligand is distorted after coordination 297 to metal, taking the examples of complexes of nickel with ethylene and acetylene (GVB CI). The complexes M-olefin, where olefin= ethylene, traps - 2-butene, cis - 2 - butene, propylene, 2,3 - dimethyl - 2 - butene and 2-methyl-2-butene were also investigated by the semiempirical CNDO method [96]. In the quest to understand fundamental aspects of alkyne catalytic reactions, structure and reactive properties of acetylene chemisorbed on metals are topics of several theoretical studies. Anderson and Hubbard [97] performed ASED MO calculations for chemisorption of acetylene on Pt, and Pty clusters. Adsorption of acetylene and adsorption of its different fragments on Pt(111) was also studied by the empirical EHT method [98]. Another approach to study chemisorption phenomenon is the solid state approach. Tight-binding type calculations for the interaction of saturated hydrocarbons (in order to discuss the activation of C-H bonds in CH4 and CZH4) with transition metal films (consisting of 2 to 5 layers of metal atoms each with valences, p and d orbital components) may serve as examples of such studies [99]. In order to obtain more information concerning the mechanism of catalytic partial oxidation of propene, -rr complexes MeC3H5+ between transition metals Co(II), Fe(II), Mn(II), Cr(II), Cu(II), Ni(II) and allyl anion [ 100-102 ] were discussed. The results can be summarized as follows: large transfer from allyl anion bonding orbital to s metal and/or important back bonding leads to complete oxidation (complexes with Co(II), Fe(II), Mn(II), Cr(II)), selectivity is achieved in complexes with Cu(II) and Ni(II). -rr complex followed by o complex was found to be formed first, the relative stabilities of these complexes depending on the intrinsic nature of the metal. Calculations support Sokolovskii's mechanism of propene oxidation [ 103 ] . The mechanism for propylene oxidation to acrolein on a bismuth molybdate was also subject of quantum chemical study done by Anderson et al. [ 104 ] by means of the ASED MO technique. As a model of the surface2 the BiZMo302- cluster was used. Results of calculations suggest the following mechanism: propylene at first coordinates to surface Mos+ through a rr donation bond, followed by Ha abstraction to a bismuth oxygen anion with a low barrier yielding an allyl-MoS+ complex. The transition state involves CH-Oz- o, donation stabilization and activation is a result of the filled CH-Oz- a* antibonding counterpart orbital being stabilized through mixing with the ir* orbital on the olefinic end. The allyl then forms a a bond to a neighboring surface oxygen atom bonded to molybdenum, and the active site is reduced by the second electron. Silvestre [ 105 ] investigated the prereduction effect on the catalytic properties Of M003 toward olefin oxidation. Band structure calculations were carried out for a naked (100) surface of M003 and for this surface covered by propene. The reduction process was simulated by injecting one or two electrons into the unit cell. It was found that prereduction plays a crucial role in the rate-determining step, the first C-H scission toward acrolein formation. The fact that computational chemistry can provide a good deal of information regarding the interaction between reacting molecules and the 298 surface of the catalyst is supported in the literature by appearance of a large number of papers devoted to the subject of different catalytic reactions. All papers try to answer a fundamental question concerning specific molecular interactions operating at the surface which are responsible for the transformation of organic molecule along one selected reaction pathway. A few examples of different catalytic problems investigated by means of various computational methods are listed below: - oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde on (010) surface of M003 (GVB method) [106]; - interaction of methanol with heteropolyacids (INDO) [107]; - insertion of ethylene into Cr-H bond (CNDO/2, INDO) [108]; - oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde in presence of PdC14 2 - (CNDO) [109]; - nucleophilic addition of organocopper reagents to acrolein (ab initio + full geometry optimization) [ 110 ]; - oxidation of toluene on CO -02 complexes (CNDO UH) [ 111 ]; - photoactivity of CUM004 toward H abstraction from methanol (ASED MO) [112]; - C-H activation in methane and in methyl group of propylene by a Bi203 surface (ASED MO) [ 113 ]; - activation of methane C-H bond on several transition metal surfaces [ 114 ] and on MOS2 [ 115 ], both studies by ASED MO; - reaction of methane with O- hole centers on the surface of M003 [116]; - methyl radical formation over Li-doped MgO surface [117]; - adsorption (bonding through C or O) of simple molecules (CO, HCO, HOC, HZCO, HCOH, CHZOH, CH30) on (001) surface of Mg and on an impurity Cu' ion (ab initio MO + lattice defect method) [ 118 ]; - indirect interaction (via solid surface) between adsorbate molecules (NH3, H20) on y A1203 catalyst (CNDO/2) [119]. It is worth mentioning a paper by Miyamoto et al. [ 120 ] concerning the reduction of nitric oxide by ammonia on a vanadium oxide catalyst. In fact, it is the only example of a complete theoretical study of the heterogeneous catalytic reaction. It includes investigations on adsorption of both reactants on the model of the catalyst and a discussion of the reaction between the reagents. In order to determine the course of the reaction between NO and NH3, CNDO/2 calculations were performed for the system composed of the catalyst, NH3 and NO with various coordinates of the system (to mimic the catalyst V-O clusters of different sizes were applied). It was found that transfer of an electron from adsorbed NH3 to NO plays an essential role in the reduction of NO by NH3. The transfer of electrons from the surface weakens the N-O bond provoking its dissociation, followed by the formation of new bonds: N (from NO) combines with N (from NH3) to form N2, O (from NO) links with 2H (from NH3) to produce H20, the residual H atom of NH3 bonds to V=O to form a V-OH species. Initial, final and some intermediate states were selected on the basis of `trial and error' calculations, i.e. by assuming different possible arrangements in complexes. 299 The interaction between the surface of the catalyst and the adsorbed molecule resulting in bond formation plays an essential role in surface chemistry and catalysis. The process of bond formation demands the fulfillment of steric requirements (e.g. a physical possibility of approaching the adsorption site), as well as energy and symmetry requirements (e.g. the accessibility of surface orbitals of appropriate energy and symmetry). All available data (both experimental and theoretical) allow classification of the interaction between molecule and oxide surface into one of the following types: - nondissociative adsorption (molecular adsorption), which can take place on a single coordinatively unsaturated surface ion; the interaction follows here from o donation and/or 7r back-donation, - dissociative adsorption, in which a molecule dissociates upon adsorption; the dissociation can proceed as either heterolytic breaking of a bond (the molecule is then dissociated into charged species) which usually requires a pair of coordinatively unsaturated anion-cation sites, or homolytic bond cleavage in which neutral species are formed, - abstractive adsorption, when the adsorbate abstracts from the surface a species (usually a proton); the resulting adsorbed cationic species interact with the surface by electrostatic force; the coordinatively unsaturated surface ions are not involved in this type of adsorption, - reductive adsorption, whereby two simultaneous processes occur: the oxidation of an adsorbed molecule and the reduction of the surface; reductive adsorption may also be abstractive (e.g. oxidation of hydrocarbon to carboxylate utilizing the lattice oxygen while reducing the cation). Reductive adsorption is typical for transition metal oxides which have cations characterized by multiple oxidation states. When a reagent molecule contacts the surface of an oxide catalyst, it may become adsorbed in different forms depending on its structure and on the properties of active centers present at the surface. Different intermediate surface complexes resulting from various forms of adsorption and corresponding to different types of activation of adsorbed species may transform into different products. This chemical approach to the problem of studying the interaction of adsorbates with surfaces focuses on the local aspects of the problem. One should however keep in mind other, dynamic aspects of catalytic phenomena. The reactants of a catalytic reaction are in dynamic interaction with the solid catalyst. Continuous exchange of matter and energy between the catalyst and the reactants leads to many phenomena, such as the change of composition of the gas phase (reacting catalytic mixture) or the change of surface composition (structure and properties) which modify the catalyst activity and selectivity. Selected properties of transition metal oOdes Understanding the mechanism of a catalytic reaction proceeding at the surface of metal oxides requires a detailed knowledge of the electronic 300 properties of the surface which are responsible for the interaction and bonding with an adsorbate, for the resulting bond changes and what follows, the reaction between adsorbed reactants and the desorption process. Metal oxides are capable of participation in the exchange of electrons, protons or oxide ions. The use of oxides in catalysis is discussed in [ 121 ]. Among oxides, by far the most important are transition metal oxides as being basic materials for the chemical, electronics and electrochemical industries. These compounds have partially filled d orbitals which are responsible for a wide variety of electronic, magnetic and catalytic properties. One of the vast field of applications of transition metal oxides is catalysis and in particular, processes of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons [ 122 ]. The surface of the catalyst for selective oxidation has to perform a complex multistep operation on the reacting molecules, hindering simultaneously such interactions which could result in unwanted by-products. Experimental evidence collected in recent years indicates that the most efficient catalysts for selective oxidation of hydrocarbons are based on Group V, VI and VII transition metal oxides. The `special' chemistry of these oxides (especially of V and Mo) results from a number of interrelated factors. The considerable extension of their d wavefunctions (which are not involved in the Me-O o- bond) with respect to the equilibrium distance between neighbouring atoms allows overlap with oxygen p orbitals of -rr symmetry. Additionally, their redox potentials relative to the anion valence band edge are favorable for bond formation [ 1231. As a result 7r bonds with oxygen are formed, the cations being shifted from the centers of octahedra towards terminal oxygen atoms. Large displacement polarizabilities give rise to high relaxation energies which decrease the cation-cation repulsions opposing formation of a structure with shorter metal-metal distances. Removal of oxygen ions from the lattice of these oxides generates ordered arrays of vacancies and is followed by facile rearrangement of coordination polyhedra resulting in the formation of shear planes. Such easy passage of one oxygen ion in the transformation from a corner-linked into an edge-linked arrangement of metal-oxygen octahedra is believed to be a factor allowing these structures to insert oxygen into organic species during the process of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons [ 76 ]. Many transition metal ions (in particular Ti, V, Mo, W) possess multiple stable oxidation states, which results in the easy conversion between oxides of different stoichiometry by oxidation or reduction. This is believed to be another important factor for these oxides to function as catalysts in selective oxidation. The formal oxidation states of transition metals in oxides vary in a wide range from one (Cu20) to eight (Os04). The true ionic charge is less than predicted from the formal oxidation number and is determined by experiment or may be estimated theoretically. Crystallites of transition metal oxides may exhibit two types of crystal faces [ 1241: - the face of chemically saturated atoms exposing either metal cations with empty d orbitals which may function as LUMOs of the oxide and behave 301 like electron acceptor sites, or oxygen ions bridging the Me-Ox polyhedra, with free electron pairs, which may act as HOMOs and play a role of electrondonor sites. Such a hydrophobic face may be responsible for activation of the hydrocarbon and preparation of a nucleophilic addition of oxygen into the organic species. When a hydrocarbon approaches such a face, the C-H bond reacts with empty d orbitals, the proton being shifted to bridging oxygen and the allyl species attaches to the cation. The empty antibonding (LUMO) C-H orbital of a methylene group of such a surface species may now interact with the lone electron pair of the surface bridging oxygen (oxide HOMO), leading to the nucleophilic addition and formation of the precursor of aldehyde; - the face built of coordinatively unsaturated cations and anions, where excess charges accumulate, generating significant variations of the potential along the surface. Such hydrophilic faces show a tendency to adsorb water molecules in a dissociative manner. The interaction of an acidic OH group with hydrocarbon results in the formation of a carbonium ion. Dehydration of the surface (on heating at higher temperature) results in the generation of coordinatively unsaturated cations (Lewis acids) and 02- ions (Lewis bases). Such pairs of sites may induce heterolytic bond scission in the adsorbed reactant. The reducing atmosphere of the reaction leads to the generation of lower valent metal cations which may activate an oxygen molecule to its electrophilically active forms. The different behaviors of various crystal faces indicates that the preparation of an active and selective catalyst requires a compromise among several opposing tendencies. Additional difficulties follow from the fact that the surfaces of crystallites are never perfect and contain steps, kinks, etc. which may act as active sites. The electronic structure of the surface of transition metal oxides is determined by its atomic structure but also reflects the bulk properties. The electronic states characteristic for the surface and interesting from the catalytic point of view lie near the Fermi energy (or valence state). Such states are either partially occupied by electrons (where they can donate and accept electrons from the molecule interacting with the surface) or close enough to the filled valence band (or empty conduction band) providing a pair of states to simultaneously accept or donate electrons to the interacting molecules. The nature of surface state depends on the type and position of the ions. A comprehensive overview, summarizing existing information on the structure, electronic properties, chemistry and catalytic properties of transition metal oxides has been published recently by Kung [1251. Tsukada et al. [126] in a review article devoted to the theoretical studies on transition metal oxides, gives a brief description of the results of theoretical calculations performed by means of the DV Xa method on the electronic structure of transition metal oxides. The nature of transition metal oxides is also discussed by Henrich [127]. Information concerning the characterization of heterogeneous catalysts by experimental techniques can be found in [ 128]. 302 Quantum chemical study of vanadium oxides Vanadium oxides are widely used as catalysts in the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons (aliphatic as well as aromatic) proceeding according to both electrophilic and nucleophilic mechanisms (see [129, 130] and references therein). One of the largest industrial processes of heterogeneous oxidation, namely the production of phthalic anhydride from naphthalene or o-xylene, is catalyzed by vanadium oxide. The building unit of V205 is a distorted octahedron [ 131, 132 ], with V-O bond distances varying from a very short 1.58 A (vanadyl group) up to a very long 2.79 A (van der Waals' type bond) (see leg. 7a). Because of this significant difference in V-O distances the coordination of V5+ ion may be regarded as tetragonal, square pyranudal or octahedral, depending on the assumption concerning the extension of the first coordination sphere. If the supposed symmetry is a deformed octahedron, each of the oxygens of the vanadyl group (the shortest V-O bond) is connected via the longest V-O bond to the neighbouring underlying vanadium. Each layer has 50% `short' and 50% `long' oxygen. Since the longest V-O bond has van der Waals' character, V205 has a layer structure with an easy cleavage plane perpendicular to the b axis. The structure of vanadium pentoxide may be described as containing zig-zag chains of edge-sharing octahedra running iso A 188 A 188 ~ozss (a) CS 278 a O y~i .,.viiy~ . i ` i ` ` W \\O (c) Fig. 7.

Therefore, the (010) plane can be discussed in terms of distorted edge and corner-linked square pyramids. Understanding the mechanism of the processes occurring at the surface of the catalyst requires an adequate description of the surface. The surface of the catalyst must be modelled. At this moment, one faces the problem of the specificity of the surface in comparison to the bulk, due to breaking of the bulk symmetry and its consequences (geometrical irregularities or changes in chemical composition due to the interaction with the gas phase). The only possible approach to elucidate the properties of such complicated systems as real surfaces is to start the study from the ideal surface. Then it is possible to extend the scope and discuss the effects of irregularities of both geometrical and chemical origin. One of the ways to approach the problem of synthesis of a surface with controlled properties is to deposite the active oxide phase on a support to obtain a monolayer catalyst [ 134-1381. The great advantage of the formation of a monolayer is related to several factors: - in the monolayer collective properties of the crystal are believed not to dominate over the atomic properties of the component atoms; - only one crystal phase is exposed; - transfer of electrons between support and monolayer may influence the type of chemically active molecular orbitals. Among monolayer systems, the most studied system is vanadia monolayer supported on titania (see for example [ 139, 140 ]). The structure of this dynamic system depends upon several factors such as surface loading, oxygen pressure, etc. At low coverage mainly V04 tetrahedra are formed (with two oxygen atoms sticking out of the surface and the other two oxygens bridging to the surface [ 141 ]). While increasing the coverage, a polymerization process takes place resulting in the formation of a two-dimensional V205-like phase exposing the (010) crystal surface. The structure of this monolayer may be described as built of ribbons of edge-sharing distorted square pyramids, with terminal double-bonded oxygen atoms pointing outwards in one row of ribbons and the ribbons linked together through apices. The interesting feature of this surface is the existence of three structurally different oxygen atoms: terminal oxygen, 0(1), (vanadyl oxygen), coordinated to one vanadium atom via a double bond, and bridge-like oxygen atoms, 0(2) and 0(3), being coordinated to two or three vanadium atoms, respectively (Fig. 7b). In order to study the behavior of the monolayer catalyst, quantum chemical calculations of molecular properties of clusters of various sizes, modelling the (010) surface of V205, were performed by means of the SINDO method [142-143]. The problem of appropriate selection of the clusters and closing of the broken bonds is discussed in [ 143 j. The clusters chosen for calculations are marked on Fig. 7c by dotted lines. All calculations were carried out without optimization of the geometry for the experimental value 304 of V=O distance equal to 1.58 A. The other V-O bonds were assumed to be equivalent and equal to 1.83 A, i.e. the average value of V-O distances in the crystal structure of V205. In order to investigate the properties of the cluster as a function of the Fermi level, whose absolute position cannot be determined, the calculations were repeated for different numbers of electrons in the system, corresponding to various formal oxidation states of the atoms composing the cluster. From the results of the calculations the following conclusions can be drawn: - independent of their size, the most stable clusters are neutral or almost neutral systems - the catalytic activity properties of an atom depend exclusively on its nearest neighbours. The increase in the size of the model or the different manner of ending of the unsaturated bonds in the cluster does not change the properties of the studied atom, providing that the nearest coordination sphere in the model mimics correctly the closest environment of this atom in the real structure. This conclusion is in agreement with the results of calculations done by Miyamoto et at. [ 120] who found that the charge densities and bond energies for the clusters mimicking surfaces containing two or three vanadium atoms are almost the same as those for a single V-O polyhedron; - the most negatively charged is terminal oxygen. The charge on structurally different oxygens changes in the order Q(O(1)) > Q(0(2)) > Q(0(3)), but the population on the px orbital (perpendicular to the square plane of the pyramid and responsible mainly for chemisorption) decreases in the order pz(0(z)) >pz(0(3)) >px(O(,?). This population can be taken as a measure of the basic character of the oxygen atoms (in the Bronsted sense) - the V-O bonds are of localized character - the study of the molecular properties of the cluster as a function of the number of electrons in the system circumvents the very complex problem concerning the closure of broken bonds when the cluster is cut from the surface, and allows study of the problem of the interaction with the support, and to discuss the properties of the cluster as a function of the position of the Fermi level. One of the commonly used interpretations of catalytic activity of transition metal oxides is based upon the concept of the acid-base properties of their surfaces. This is due to the fact that the results of many studies done by various physicochemical methods show the dominant role of local factors and reveal the nature of active sites in heterogeneous catalysis. The acidbase properties of the surface may be discussed in terms of Lewis (transfer of electrons pair) or Bronsted (transfer of proton) definitions (see for example [125, 144] and references therein). The Lewis definition is more general than the Bronsted definition. The Lewis acidic centers are acceptors of electron pairs; Lewis basic centers donate electron pairs. Acceptance or donation of electrons pairs by Lewis-type sites on the surface occur in order to form coordination bonds with the molecules of donor or acceptor properties, 305 respectively. All cations are acidic centers whereas all anions form basic sites. Bronsted centers may dissociate with liberation of protons; basic Br6nsted sites can accept protons. According to such a definition neutral as well as positive or negative ions may act as acidic and basic Bronsted sites. The terms `acidity' or 'basicity' is ambiguous. To describe acido-basic properties of a solid one should determine the nature of centers, their number per unit surface area and their strength [ 1281. The acido-basic features of solids substantially overlap with the acceptor and donor surface states [145]; both approaches are parallel and complementary. Lewis acidic sites as well as acceptor surface states are associated with a strong affinity towards electrons whereas the opposite is true for basic sites or donor surface states. The role of acid-base properties of oxide catalysts through modification of the adsorption of the reactants is well established [ 146-1481. The acid-base sites act in many steps of the complex parallel-consecutive mechanism of selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. The adsorption and activation of hydrocarbon may be discussed in terms of an acid-base process assuming that the adsorption of hydrocarbons takes place on exposed metal cation (lewis acid) whereas the abstraction of hydrogen proceeds on an oxygen ion (Lewis base). Each of the oxygen ions exposed on a (010) surface of vanadium oxide has different basic properties. The difference in basic properties of these structurally different atoms has been discussed by Anderson [ 149, 150 ] using a model which is an extension of the Pauling bond strength concept to the vanadium oxide surface. In this method the bond strength of the metal-oxygen bond was estimated using an empirical formula dependent on the V-O bond length. It was found that the O 2- ion in the form of V=O surface groups is responsible for the catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas the Oion is hindered by the formation of the stable OH- group. The fact that the bond strength values are proportional to the bond energy of the metal-oxygen bond was also considered by Ziolkowski [151, 152]. In order to study the basic properties of structurally different oxygen centers, the adsorption of proton on O(l), 0(2) and 0(3) oxygens as well as the desorption of different hydroxyl groups was investigated using the quantum chemical SINDO method [ 1531. Two model clusters were taken into consideration: the cluster built of two corner-linked square pyramids (model 2 in reported calculations [142], which can distinguish only 0(1) and 0(2)) and the cluster formed of six square pyramids (model 6 which has all symmetry elements of (010) crystal plane of V205 and can differentiate 0(,), 0(2) and 0(3)). The calculations were carried out for different numbers of electrons in the system in order to discuss the dependence of the electronic structure of the monolayer on the properties of the support. Results of the calculations (Table 3) obtained by applying both model clusters are very similar. The strength of the adsorption of proton on various types of oxygen centers (measured as a decrease in total energy of the system in respect to the sum of energies of isolated cluster and proton) changes in the order 0(2) > 0(3) > 0(1). Thus, when the proton approaches the 306 TABLE 3 Results of SINDO calculations for adsorption of proton on structurally different oxygen atoms on V205 monolayer and for desorption of various OH groups Adsorp- R On terminal oxygen O(,) On bridge oxygen O(2) tion (A) Etot Qo(j) QH Etot QO(2) QH NEL=72 0.7 -3928.97 -1.02 +0.71 -3934.70 -0.93 +0.76 V5+02- 0.9 -3929.05 -0.97 +0.70 -3935.58 -0.90 +0.76 1.2 -3924.77 -0.97 +0.70 -3939.44 -0.89 +0.78 1.5 -3919.07 -0.99 +0.74 -3928.89 -0.90 +0.80 NEL=76 0.7 -3772.80 -1.06 -0.97 -3777.07 -1.05 +0.78 V3+02- 0.9 -3776.55 -1.09 -0.99 -3777.73 -1.01 +0.77 1.2 -3778.44 -1.12 -1.00 -3774.20 -1.01 +0.78 1.5 -3780.22 -1.14 -1.00 -3770.15 -1.02 +0.80 Desorp- R O(,)H group O(2)H group tion (A) Etot QOO) QH Etot QO(2) QH NEL=72 0.0 -3929.05 -0.97 +0.70 -3935.58 -0.90 +0.76 v5+02- 0.3 -3933.42 -1.25 +0.68 -3933.47 -0.85 +0.76 0.6 -3934.33 -1.35 +0.67 -3931.23 -0.86 +0.76 0.9 -3935.83 -1.46 +0.67 -3928.89 -0.91 +0.75 1.2 -3937.54 -1.54 +0.67 -3926.27 -0.98 +0.73 1.5 -3939.31 -1.59 +0.67 -3923.44 -1.08 +0.71 1.8 - 3941.02 -1.63 + 0.67 - 3921.58 -1.20 + 0.69 2.1 -3941.78 -1.67 +0.68 -3921.77 -1.27 +0.68 2.4 - 3944.08 -1.66 + 0.68 - 3925.98 -1.40 + 0.66 3.0 -3946.57 -1.67 +0.68 -3936.93 -1.53 +0.65 4.0 -3946.68 -1.68 +0.68 -3952.34 -1.63 +0.66 5.0 - 3951.89 -1.69 + 0.69 - 3960.35 -1.66 + 0.67 NEL=76 0.0 -3776.55 -1.09 -0.99 -3777.73 -1.01 +0.77 V3+02- 0.6 -3782.17 -1.61 -0.99 -3772.95 -0.95 +0.74 0.9 -3785.37 -1.75 -0.99 -3771.04 -0.98 +0.72 1.2 -3788.95 -1.84 -0.99 -3768.88 -1.03 +0.69 1.5 -3792.63 -1.90 -0.99 -3766.44 -1.11 +0.66 1.8 -3796.25 -1.94 -0.99 -3765.00 -1.21 +0.63 2.1 -3798.67 -2.00 -1.00 -3766.15 -1.30 +0.60 2.4 -3802.98 -1.98 -1.00 -3770.20 -1.37 +0.58 3.0 -3808.78 -1.99 -1.00 -3782.97 -1.49 +0.57 4.0 -3816.62 -2.00 -1.00 -3801.56 -1.59 +0.60 5.0 -3822.73 -2.00 -1.00 -3812.13 -1.63 +0.63 surface oxygens the total energy of system as a function of a distance R(O.,-H) decreases and reaches a minimum, which suggests a formation of OxH groups (where x=1, 2, 3); the adsorption proceeds without an energy barrier. This is true for numbers of electrons in systems smaller or equivalent 307 to the assumption of formal oxidation states V5+02-. The reduction of vanadium from V5+02- to V3+02- results in a completely different picture of adsorption. The adsorption of a proton on bridge-like oxygen ions 0(2) and 0(3) proceeds with the energy barrier whereas adsorption on the terminal oxygen center does not occur. The desorption of O(1)H hydroxyl group proceeds in all cases without an energy barrier and can be discussed as a process generating the naked vanadium center. Desorption of other hydroxyls 0(2)H or 0(3)H requires an activation energy. Results of calculations suggest the following mechanism: on approaching the surface of V205 a proton `sees' different types of oxygen centers: terminal oxygen 0(1) protruding from the surface, and surface bridge-like oxygens 0(2) and 0(3) being in-plane. Although the terminal oxygen atoms are the most accessible centers for adsorption of proton (no steric hindrance), the proton becomes preferentially adsorbed on the most basic oxygen atoms, i.e. on bridge-like oxygens. Thus, one can postulate that it is a bridging oxygen which is involved in the abstraction of a-hydrogen from the hydrocarbon molecule in course of catalytic reaction. In the literature one can find a great number of papers concerning the electronic structure of transition metal oxides. The simplest model used in calculations is a diatomic molecule M-O. This model was applied in order to study the electronic and bonding properties of (Fe0) , 1 + 1- (modified MINDO) [35], Coo (modified CNDO UHF) [39], Cu0 [154] and Ti0 [155] both by ab initio SCF+CI method. It was also used in the calculations carried out for the whole series of diatomic first row transition metal oxide molecules [156, 157] to obtain information concerning the nature of bond, bond length, harmonic stretching constants and dissociation energy. The more elaborate model M02 was already discussed in the chapter devoted to the chemisorption of oxygen on transition metal oxide surfaces [35-39]. The majority of calculations regarding the electronic properties of metal oxides are performed by means of Xa type methods and by applying the cluster models of M04 q or M06P types. The isoelectronic series of tetraoxoanions V043-, Cr04 2- and Mn04_ was investigated by the SINDO method [65] and by the MS Xa (Multiple Scattering) method [158] in order to explain photoelectron spectra and electronic adsorption spectra. Similar studies were done for OS04 (MS Xa) [159] and for CU04 6- and Zn046- (SCF Xa) [160] oxoanions. For all discussed oxides the results of calculations are in relatively good agreement with experimental spectra. The multiple scattering method with local exchange and muffin tin potential was applied also to tetrahedral clusters with Cue+, Nit +, Co2+ and Fe 2+ as central ions and oxygen as ligand [ 161 ]. The calculated orbital energy gap At was found to be similar to that deduced from optical spectra. Octahedral clusters were used in studying the electronic structure of NiOslo- (O initio + CI) [ 162, 163 ], CoOgl - (ab initio + Cl) [ 164], WOB6[165], TiOgl - and VOgI - (MS Xa) [166], Mo06 (ASED MO) [167]. Bagus and Wahlgren [ 162 ] stabilized the highly negative cluster by an electrostatic 308 potential included in the calculations in the form of point charges at appropriate positions. Values of the point charges were obtained by a least square fit to the Madelung field of the crystal, the latter being calculated by the Ewald technique (for more information regarding Madelung potential see [ 168 ]). Cobalt and nickel oxides are found to be of ionic character. Metal d electrons are well localized on the metal ion and do not participate to any appreciable extent in covalent bonding. The influence of the surrounding lattice simulated by point charges was also included in calculations performed for the W06 6cluster [ 1651, mimicking a part of the perovskite structure A2BW06 in order to study the role of ions A and B on the position of emission and excitation bands, Gubanov et al. [ 166 ] discussed the problem of stabilization of energy levels Of V06 10- and Ti061 - clusters in the crystal lattice of oxide with higher oxidation number. A bulk polarization effect was also included in calculations carried out to estimate the Mott-Hubbard gap and the charge transfer gap of solid Ni0 [ 163 ]. A number of calculations reported in the literature concern clusters composed of several M-O polyhedra. Anderson et al. [1671 studied the bonding and electronic structure Of Mo03, oxygen deficient Mo03 as well as a, /3, and y phases of Bi203 using not only small MO6 clusters but also the large MOg024 cluster. The increase in cluster size allowed study of the splitting of crystal field levels into bands. Different molybdate clusters M0042-, Mo066-, Mo80204- mimicking oxide catalyst were applied as models for a discussion of the electronic structure of polyoxometallates; in particular, polyoxomolybdates (EHMO) [ 169, 170 ]. It was found that the main factor which influences the electronic energy levels of polyoxomolybdates is not always the local symmetry, and that the condensation of several MOO units in polyoxomolybdates involves a delocalization of molecular orbitals over the whole compound, resulting in a loss in individuality of each tetrahedron or octahedron. Clusters of large sizes were also used to investigate the electronic properties of dodecamolybdophosphates by the combined use of the model potential and Slater Xa potential methods [ 171 ]. Special attention was paid to estimate the difference in activity among various types of oxygen atoms in the reduction process. Another example of application of large clusters (twelve metal ions+oxygens) is the calculations performed by Xa model potential method for XM01204 heteropolyanions (where X=P, As, Si, Ge) [ 172 ]. It was found that general features of the valence energy bands are almost unaffected by changing the central atom. Thus the authors postulated that the catalytic oxidation reactions in these systems operate by a redox cycle of the heteropolyanion which is accompanied by the transfer of electron between a reactant molecule and the heteropolyanion. The central atom caused a subtle difference in the catalytic reduction and oxidation behavior. The structure of the Keggin unit was also studied by the EHT [ 173 ] method. The results suggest that Bronsted acidity increases as the magnitude of the negative charge on the outer oxygen atoms of the heteropoly fragment decreases. The activity in the oxidation reaction can be correlated with the 309 energy associated with the bond between the outer oxygen atom and the peripheral metal atom. The electronic properties of transition metal oxides are also discussed with the use of band-structure type methods including the effect of correlation. For example, RHF calculations were performed for FeO, CoO, Ni0 [ 174 ]. Neckel [ 175 ] and Calais [ 176 ] reviewed the band structure calculations performed for the groups IV and V transition metal monooxides, monocarbides and mononitriles. The narrow metal 3b band was found to lie inside the broad oxygen 2p band. Band-structure type calculations were also carried out in order to probe the electronic implications of the prereduction step for naked M003 and the whole surface /olefin system [ 105 ] . Mayer in his statistical study [ 177 ] explored the factors that influence M-O multiple distances by examining the structure of more than 600 complexes basing upon the data derived primarily from X-ray crystallography. The interest in studying metal oxo and related complexes is that such compounds perform a role not only as reagents or catalysts for organic reactions but they also act as models for active sites in heterogeneous processes. The mean M-O distances for mono-oxocomplexes for eleven transition metals (from Ti to Os) were determined and the following conclusions were drawn: - the mean values of M-O bond decrease on moving from left to right across the periodic table with the exception of unusually long bonds observed for d4 octahedral complexes of Fe and Os; - the bond lengths in di- and trioxo species are on average longer than those in monooxo species; - the M-O distance is generally not a sensitive function of the coordination number or the oxidation state of the metal; - the only ligand that strongly influences the M-O distance is the second oxo group; - the M-O bond length depends primarily on the M-O bond order as determined using a simple ligand field description. This paper, although not directly dealing with the properties of transition metal oxides, provides input data for many quantum chemical calculations based upon the cluster model. Another general and interesting paper by Che and Bonneviot [ 178 ] is devoted to the role of the oxide surface in the coordination chemistry of transition metal ions in catalytic systems and contributes to the concept of the interrelation between homo- and heterogeneous catalysis. The application of modern surface techniques to study transition metal compound surfaces (including oxide surfaces) are reviewed in [179]. Although transition metal oxides are used in a great number of heterogeneously catalysed processes, the properties of their surface (the nature of the active site) and of their bulk (electronic band structure) are features which are still not fully understood. In order to derive a comprehensive and complete picture of the oxide (bulk and surface) a wide range of topics have to be studied by the common use of different experimental techniques and theoretical approaches. Solid oxide catalysts expose a large variety of 310 active centers. The type and density of these centers are determined by the reaction conditions (state of oxidation-reduction, hydration, temperature etc.) At the surface of metal oxides with only one stable oxidation state the role of active centers is performed by coordinatively unsaturated surface cations or anions which act as acidic or basic sites. In the case of oxides of multivalent metals which form a series of oxides corresponding to different oxidation states, active sites include surface cations in different oxidation states. The nature of the active sites present at the surface and the ability of transition metal oxides to form different types of bonding between coordination polyhedra are the most important factors in determining their catalytic properties. Direct reaction between hydrocarbon and oxygen molecules The reaction between hydrocarbon and oxygen molecules which starts either by an activation of oxygen or by an activation of hydrocarbon, may follow various reaction pathways giving a number of different products. A catalyst, by interacting with the reacting molecule, modifies some selected bonds within the molecule (without activating all others), facilitates the rearrangement of bonds and, directs the reaction along a certain selected pathway which permits formation of one chosen product with very high selectivity. A fundamental question may be raised: which parameters determine that the reacting system selects a given reaction pathway out of many possible alternatives? This subject has a direct bearing upon the fundamental problem of catalysis and involves the role of steric and electronic factors imposed upon the reacting molecules by their interactions with the surface of the catalyst, in determining the selectivity of the catalytic reaction. It seemed therefore of interest to study a model system composed of various oxygen species approaching the organic molecules from different directions. Such investigations of the direct reactions between the reactants performed parallel to the studies concerned with adsorption may provide complementary information and play a fundamental role in understanding the mechanism of oxidation reactions. One of the theoretical descriptions which may be used to discuss the problem of selection of the reaction pathways which lead to the desired products is based upon the concept of the potential energy surface (PES) [ 180-188 ]. A detailed knowledge of PES, permits description of a process of converting reactants into products involving one or more elementary reactions (i.e. concerted processes in which one or more bonds disappear and/or are formed or are regrouped [ 189 ]). Chemical reactions and conformational changes correspond to paths of minimal energy of PESs. The pathway for reactions with a barrier is a curve on a multidimensional potential energy surface which connects minima and passes through saddle points. In any point the reaction pathway is perpendicular to the isoenergetic curves i.e. the reaction pathway is the steepest descent path when going from the saddle point to the minima. The minima on the PES (characterized 311 by all positive eigenvalues of the corresponding second derivatives matrix called the force constant matrix, or Hessian) represent reactants, products and intermediates, whereas first order saddle points (points with one negative eigenvalue of the respective Hessian matrix) are associated with active complexes (transition states). The reaction coordinate, which is usually considered as a synonym of the reaction path, is a one-dimensional representation, i.e. a measurable curve along the reaction pathway. An advantage of the quantum chemical approach over experimental methods is that it is possible to study all parts of the PES, whereas with experimental techniques only those parts of the PES are accessible which are close to stable structures. Detailed understanding of the mechanism of a chemical reaction requires a knowledge of PES, which must be determined point by point by quantum chemical methods because in general it is not available analytically. The construction of PES is a difficult and time-consuming procedure, especially when a system of large size is under consideration (as is usually the case with catalysis). This is due to the need to determine an energy grid containing n\" points, where v is the number of variables on which the energy depends and n is the number of values of each variable required to characterize the PES [ 190, 1911. There are several methods to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. One consists in the selection of one or two degrees of freedom as independent variables keeping the remaining ones constant, or better, optimizing them for each value of the independent variables [ 192 ]. One can also apply functionfitting techniques to generate an analytic function representing the reduced PES [ 193 ], or to locate only certain, chemically interesting, points on PES (minima, saddle points) by considering all degrees of freedom [194]. There are also approaches which follow curved reaction paths with comparatively large step sizes and which do not require the calculation of the Hessian at all points along the path [183]. Another possibility is to limit the discussion to `intuitive reaction paths'. This class of reaction pathways has one common feature: a geometric parameter such as bond distance (which is to be broken) or bond angle is intuitively chosen as a reaction coordinate. The energy is calculated in each step along this coordinate by minimalization with respect to all or several other internal coordinates. An alternative and very promising method is to limit the calculations to only those reaction pathways characterized by the lowest energy barriers and what follows, which are assumed to be the most probable pathways [195]. The choice of such a reaction pathway may rely upon the form of the potential energy surface at large distances between the reactants. This assumption is based on experimental data which suggest that the form of the transition state is determined already in the preliminary stage of the reaction. The energy gradient evaluated from the difference of the total energies at two arbitrarily chosen points on the reaction coordinate at relatively long distances between the reacting molecules may serve as the indication of the potential energy barrier encountered on approach from the given 312 direction. This concept of looking for the most favorable rea Aion pathways was selected when discussing the oxidation of butene-1 [1961, benzene [197, 198], o-xylene [199] and toluene [200] molecules. In all calculations presented in this paragraph, interactions with the catalyst were not explicitly included but the catalyst presence was accounted for by repeating the calculations for several numbers of electrons in the system, as during the catalytic process transfer of electrons from or to the surface of the catalyst may occur. The operation of the catalyst was also implicitly included by performing calculations for the system composed of various forms of reactant species (i.e. various types of oxygen moieties or activated forms of the organic molecule), which are generated at the catalyst surface in the first step of the oxidation process. The reported calculations were carried out by means of the MNDO quantum chemical method; the program contained a procedure for locating minima on MNDO potential surfaces by applying the DFl algorithm [201-204]. Oxidation of olefins Starting from propene all olefin molecules contain a hydrogen atom in an a position with respect to the C=C double bond (Hj. Such an atom is more reactive than the other hydrogen atoms and is more easily abstracted (under catalytic reaction conditions) generating an allyl-like species. The abstraction of Ha and formation of an allyl moiety is the first step in the allylic oxidation of hydrocarbons. Activation of the propene molecule and its oxidation to acrolein was already discussed. Here the reaction between butene-1 and oxygen molecules will be described. The allyl species obtained by the activation of the butene molecule may react along several different reaction pathways. Oxidation of butO-1 Figure 8 shows the reaction network of butene oxidation at the surface of an oxide catalyst. When a Bronsted acid site is present on the surface, the interaction of butene-1 with the surface results in the formation of a carbocation which starts an easy route of double bond shift and ends on cis-trans isomerization ([2051 and references therein). When butene interacts with a Lewis acid site (empty d orbitals of the transition metal) it becomes bonded to the surface through its it electrons. When the basicity of surface oxide ions OZ- is high enough, the proton in the position a to the C=C double bond is abstracted and an allyl-like species is generated [124]. Repetition of this step with the proton at C4, now in the a position to the allylic group, results in the formation of butadiene. The transfer of the electrons between the surface and the allyl species depends on the electronic properties of the oxide. If the allyl species gets a positive charge, nucleophilic attack of the 02- surface ion may occur resulting in the formation of crotonaldehyde (attack on C1) or methyl vinyl ketone (attack on C3). Both routes represent nucleophilic oxidation [34]. In the case when electrophilic oxygen species are generated at the surface, oxidation proceeds according 313 attack on C=C leading to oxygenolysis~ formation of acetaldehyde and acetic acid electrophilic oxygen + t+ CH 3-CH-CH2-CH3 r-~ CH.-CH=CH-CH 3 CH 2=CH-CH2-CH3 -Ha on surface basic oxide ions CH 2-CH-CH-CH3 + OH ------------- CH2=CH-CH=CH2 CH 2-CH-CH-CH3 1 + electrophilic ~ 02 nucleophilic oxygen addition furan O HOC-CH=CH-CH3 CH 2=CH-g-CH3 maleic anhydride croton aldehyde methyl vinyl ketone CH 2=CH-CH2-CH3 CH 2=CH-CH=CH2 BiP04 + '~' CH 2=CH-CO-CH3 Ni0-Te02 02 CH 3-CH=CH-CH=O Cu 20-Mo03 CH 3-CH2-CO-CH3 Sn02-Mo03 C~ -C/O H3PMo12040 _C%O -Cj0 V205-Ti02 \\~'O O 2 C-C~ V205-Ti02 O 4 C02 + 4 H20 Co 304 Wig. 8. The reaction network for butene oxidation and products of oxidation on different catalysts. to the electrophilic mechanism [25] leading either to oxygenolysis or to the formation of acids and anhydrides. On studying the oxidation of the butene molecule by a quantum chemical approach, the most probable reaction pathways were selected based on calculations of simple energy maps constructed in such a way that the total 314 energies of the system built of an oxygen species and butene-1 or its allylic form for two distances between reactants were calculated, with the geometry of the subsystems frozen. Calculations of the energy of the system along reaction pathways proceeding with full geometry optimization were performed only for those directions of the attack of oxygen moieties on hydrocarbon species where the attack was expected to proceed with a relatively low energy barrier. In order to study the oxidation of butene, three different systems were taken into consideration: - the reaction between non-activated butene-1 and dioxygen molecule; - the interaction between butene, activated by abstraction of Ha and molecular oxygen; - the attack of atomic oxygen on allyl species. Let us first discuss the reaction between dioxygen and the non-activated butene molecule. The results of the calculations of the energy maps indicate only one direction of attack which is expected to proceed with a relatively low energy barrier: attack from above the plane of butene-1 onto the double C=C bond (the axis Of OZ species parallel to the double bond). Figure 9 summarizes the reaction pathways obtained for the attack of OZ, (Fig. 9a), and Oz- (Fig. 9b), moieties. The attack of both species onto the double bond, C1=C2, results in the scission of this bond and formation of methanal and propanal molecules as products, although the shape of the reaction paths for these two cases is quite different. The high energy barrier encountered for the attack of the OZ molecule arises from the necessity of simultaneous elongation and cleavage of two double bonds, O=O and C1=C2.

The local minimum corresponds to the end-on addition of the oxygen species onto the C2 atom. Such an intermediate easily rearranges and forms a bridgelike transition state in which the oxygen molecule is bonded to two carbons, C1 and C2, forming a dioxirane ring. In the final step of the reaction cleavage of two bonds takes place: first the O-O bond is broken, then the C-C bond is split. These two scissions result in the formation of two aldehyde molecules. Electrophilic attack in the case of butene-2 is directed to the double bond C2=C3. Two molecules of ethanal are formed as a result of the cleavage of the dioxirane ring. Let us now consider attack of molecular oxygen on the butene molecule activated by the abstraction of a hydrogen. The calculated energy maps limit the discussion to the -1 charged system and indicate the attack on terminal carbon atom C1 as the only one which is expected to proceed with relatively low energy barrier. The following routes of approach of the oxygen molecule to the allylic species are possible (Pig. 10): - in-plane attack along the C1-C2 bond direction, the oxygen axis perpendicular to the allyl plane (relatively low energy barrier, Pig. 10a, full line); - attack from above the plane onto C1 (no energy barrier, Fig. 10a, dotted line); - in-plane attack onto C1 along the direction perpendicular to the C1-C2 bond, oxygen axis perpendicular to the plane (also relatively low energy barrier, Pig. l0b); - attack from above the plane on the C2-C3 bond (Pig. l0c). Figure 10 summarizes the reaction pathways for the different attacks of molecular oxygen on the allylic species. The two attacks on C1 from above the plane and in-plane along the axis of the C1-C2 bond, result in the formation of the same type of oxidized species (Fig. l0a). The reaction path goes via a local minimum associated with the formation of superoxotype species (end-on addition of oxygen molecule to the C1 atom). This step encounters no energy barrier for the attack from above the plane (dotted line); the energy barrier for the in-plane attack on C1 (full line); follows from the steric hindrance caused by hydrogen atoms bonded to this atom. Starting from the local minimum both routes of attack are described by the same reaction pathway. The rearrangement of the system in the next step requires about 3 eV and leads to the transition state which is a peroxo-type species (side-on addition of oxygen molecule to C1 atom). The final reorganization of the system consisting of the transfer of one hydrogen atom and formation of the OH group proceeds without the energy barrier. The oxygenated species formed may be the precursor of either crotonaldehyde or crotonic acid. The results of additional calculations performed for the process of the removal of OH group (formation of an aldehyde) and for the process of abstraction of H atom (formation of an acid), indicate that the formation of crotonaldehyde is the energetically more favourable process. 316 -1245 x.1250 a W a o -12 55 (a) -1240 a -0 0-0 0 H-R~H H-C~F , H'p!C 0.5 1.5 REACTION COORDINATE, 1p9pially1- 125( li H 0'D~ C H CiCx H H 0,0 H H.

The reaction pathway for the in-plane attack of molecular oxygen on C1, along the direction perpendicular to the C1-C2 bond, is shown in Fig. lOb. The shape of the pathway as well as the types of species associated with the local minimum and with the transition state are similar to those previously discussed. The difference in product, which is an anion of crotoruc acid, arises from the fact that in this case both hydrogen atoms bonded to the C1 atom are close to each other and may be abstracted in the form of a hydrogen molecule. The attack of molecular oxygen on the C2-C3 bond from above the plane is presented in Fig. lOc. The first local minimum is connected with the end-on addition of oxygen molecule to C3. Or rearrangement, which requires only - 1.5 eV, the bridge-like oxygenated species 317 is formed with an oxygen molecule bonded to the C3 and C2 atoms. In the last step of the reaction simultaneous cleavage of the C2-C3 and O-O bonds takes place and two molecules of ethanal are formed as products (one deficient in one hydrogen atom). In all cases discussed the distance between the middle of the O-O bond and the C1 atom or the middle of the appropriate C-C bond was taken as the reaction coordinate. One should mention that the extra electron for large distances was found to reside on the allyl-like species so, in fact, the attack of molecular oxygen on allylic anions was studied. As the last case let us discuss the reaction between the activated butene molecule and atomic oxygen species (Fig. 11). Results of the calculations of energy maps indicate two directions of the attack of oxygen onto allyl for which the energy gradients have negative values and therefore, along which the reaction can proceed without the energy barrier. Such situations occur for attacks from above the plane of allyl onto the C1 and C3 atoms in the case of -1 charged system. Indeed, when atomic oxygen approaches the C1 or C3 atoms from such a direction the total energy of the system decreases continuously (Fig. Ila and llb, dotted lines), oxygen is added to the appropriate carbon atom and after final rearrangement the crotonaldehyde or methyl vinyl ketone-like species are formed, respectively. In-plane attacks on both carbon atoms (Fig. Ila and llb, full lines) also proceed without the energy barrier but lead to the formation of alcohollike species.

It is interesting that the oxidation of C 1 or C3 in the case of - 2 charged systems proceeds directly to the desired products, e.g. to crotonaldehyde or methyl vinyl ketone, respectively. In these processes the negatively charged hydrogen is abstracted. The process may be split into two steps: formation of the precursors (the case of -1 charged system) and addition of an extra electron to each of the precursors. Such two-step reactions are energetically more favorable than the concerted process of oxidation (the case of - 2 charged system). The oxidation of C1 and C3, in the case of a neutral system, leads to appropriate alcohols with the energy barrier equal to 2.8 and 2.3 eV, respectively. Oxidation of aromatics Oxidation reactions of aromatics may be classified into two categories: - side-chain oxidation of alkyl aromatics without affecting the ar electron system of the aromatic ring. Such an oxidation proceeds according to the nucleophilic mechanism and yields aldehydes and acids or anhydrides; - oxidation of the,rr electron system involving the destruction of the aromatic ring. Such a process proceeds along the electrophilic route and results in the formation of acid anhydrides. Otion of benzene molecule The mechanism of the selective oxidation of benzene is fairly complicated. The main products are maleic anhydride and carbon oxides [206] although the formation of some amounts of quinone, hydroquinone and other intermediates is also reported [207-210]. The main question regarding the molecular mechanism of this process concerns the nature of the first step of the reaction: is it hydrogen abstraction or oxygen addition. The mechanism consisting of hydrogen abstraction as the first stage followed by the identical second process in the para position and addition of oxygen to such radicals was proposed by Germain [2111. Another mechanism proceeding through attack of the oxygen molecule onto the fully symmetrical benzene ring was suggested by Dmuchovsky [212] and strongly supported by Waugh [213, 214]. The reaction network with all possible intermediates is shown in Fig. 12. The goal of the calculations performed was to answer the general question: whether the role of the catalyst consists in the appropriate deformation of the benzene molecule and its transformation into asymmetric species which will allow the more facile incorporation of oxygen, or is it activation of oxygen which makes attack possible? On studying the oxidation of the benzene molecule the intuitive reaction pathways were considered and three reaction pathways were assumed as most favorable for the reaction (Fig. 13): 319 C6H6(8)`______> C6 H6(a)__ z(a)> 0 O _____> HG (a) -~`~///(a) ~O 2(g) 2a) O HO~H O= C:>-__-o O Z 0 (a) H20(g) + C2 H2 (a) + O=C \\ ~C-0 02 ~l C02(g) + CO(g) + H(g) C4H203(g) Fig. 12.

Both the reaction between non-activated substrates and the preliminary activation of dioxygen via elongation of its bond were taken into consideration. Let us start from the discussion of the reaction pathway I. If a nonactivated dioxygen (Fig. 13.I.a) approaches the benzene molecule along this path the total energy of the system rises continuously, indicating that no attractive chemical interactions develop. Activation of the oxygen molecule by stretching the initial O-O bond to the value of 1.49 A which is characteristic for the 022- ion results in an attractive interaction (minimum energy). The species with geometry close to the experimental geometry of o-dihydroxybenzene is formed (Fig. 13.I.o). In the case of reaction pathway II, independent of the preliminary activation of oxygen, the system behaves in the same manner. The reaction path is complex and consists of three distinct parts, apparently corresponding to three different states. From additional calculations in which the geometry of the reacting system corresponding to the selected points on the appropriate part of the potential energy curve was taken as the input, and the value of the reaction coordinate increased, the following conclusions can be drawn: - the interaction between oxygen and benzene in the mutual arrangement discussed proceeds with the energy barrier; 320 -E[eVl~ 1480 -1 -0 1485 S-P- - I 1490 14951 E[ VI 1480 148!

Reaction pathways for the attack of oxygen species on benzene. (i) In-plane attack, oxygen axis parallel to the side of ring: a. nonactivated oxygen Ro_o=1.27 A; b. activated oxygen Ro_o=1.49 A. (II) in-plane attack, oxygen axis perpendicular to the side of ring: 1. Ro_o=1.27 A; 2. Ro_o=1.49 A; 3. Ro_o=3.9 A. (III) reaction pathway directed perpendicular to the center of benzene ring, oxygen axis parallel to the ring in diagonal position: a. Ro_o=1.27 A; b. Ro_o=1.49 .A; c. Ro_o=3.9 A. 321 - in the transition state two carbon atoms onto which the attack of oxygen is directed are pulled strongly apart and the oxygen molecule has a considerably elongated O-O bond; - the energy barrier follows from the opening of the C-C bond of the benzene ring and the elongation of the O-O bond; - further evolution of the system resulting in the extraction of two carbon atoms of the benzene ring together with their hydrogens towards the oxygen molecule proceeds without the energy barrier. The minimum on the reaction pathway corresponds to two interacting neutral parts: a four-carbon residual fragment of the benzene ring and a nearly cyclic C2H202 moiety of composition equivalent to glyoxal. Both species are of the weak radical character; therefore it may be expected that further splitting of the intermediates, although energetically costly, will occur under conditions of heterogeneous catalytic reaction leading to products of total oxidation. The results of additional calculations of the dependence of the total energy of the system on the angle between the axis of oxygen and the plane of the benzene molecule, carried out for two high values of reaction coordinate, indicate that route II is favorable for nonactivated oxygen and route I for activated oxygen. In other words, in the presence of gaseous oxygen the benzene molecule may undergo total oxidation. Let us switch to the third route of oxygen approach to the benzene ring. When non-activated oxygen attacks a benzene ring along this direction (Fig. 13.III.a), no reaction takes place, the total energy of the system as a function of the reaction coordinate increases continuously. The activation of dioxygen by the elongation of the O-O bond up to the value 1.49 A (022- ion), (Fig. 13.III.b), entails the appearance of a shallow minimum on the reaction path, associated with the formation of the metastable intermediate complex quinone-like species, in which the oxygen molecule is bonded in a bridge-like manner to the opposing 1, 4 carbon atoms of the benzene ring. Activation of oxygen molecules to such an extent that in fact, two separate oxygen atoms approach the benzene ring (Ro_o = 3.9 A), (Fig. 13.IIIc), leads to different phenomenon. The total energy of the system decreases monotonously along the reaction path and reaches a minimum corresponding to a hydroquinone-like complex. Oxygen atoms displace the hydrogen atoms at the opposing 1,4 carbon atoms and assume positions between carbon and hydrogen, with C-O and O-H distances typical for organic compounds. In order to obtain more information regarding the studied reaction, the influence of an additional charge on the oxygen molecule was also considered. The results of calculations indicate that the extra electrons activated the oxygen in a manner similar to the preliminary stretching of the O-O bond. The reaction pathway is of the same character as in the case of the attack of neutral oxygen with Ro_o=1.49 A and as the product a quinone-like species is formed. Results of the calculations carried out for the reaction between isolated reactants may be transferred to the situation on the surface of transition metal oxides (for example V206). A benzene molecule may be adsorbed in 322 planar or vertical position with respect to the surface. From the ESR spectra it was found that the axis of the adsorbed molecular oxygen ion is perpendicular to the surface. Thus the situation existing at the surface favors the mutual orientation between the reacting molecules as described by the last discussed route. Based upon these facts the mechanism of the oxidation of benzene to maleic anhydride may be proposed consisting of the formation of a bridgelike intermediate as the first step of the reaction, and its further facile rearrangement into hydroquinone. This sequence of elementary operations may be then repeated with the second oxygen molecule, i.e. a bridge-like intermediate with hydroquinone may be formed giving an adsorbed molecule of maleic anhydride after final rearrangement. Oxidation of o-xyO The reaction network of the oxidation of o-xylene can be represented by the scheme illustrated in Fig. 14 [129, 215]. In addition to the usual network, the formation of o-toluic acid and o-methyl benzyl alcohol suggested by Bernardini [216] may also be also taken into account. In the first step one of the methyl groups is oxidized to form tolualdehyde which is then oxidized further to phthalic anhydride. Maleic anhydride is the byproduct obtained from direct oxidation of o-xylene, whereas phthalide is a byproduct formed from tolualdehyde.

Directions of the attack of oxygen on o-xylene and the geometries of formed species. 324 I. the axis of OZ parallel to the double C=C bond of the ring II. the axis of OZ perpendicular to C=C bond of the ring III. the axis of OZ perpendicular to C=C with one oxygen atom located in plane 2. - in-plane attack of oxygen molecule on activated o-xylene, activation assumed via abstraction of hydrogen atom from one of the methyl groups (Fig. 15.2): I. attack along the axis passing through the -CH2 group diagonally to the benzene ring II. attack along the axis passing through the -CH2 group diagonally to the ring, its orientation being perpendicular to the ring; 3. - attack of atomic oxygen on -CH2 group of activated o-xylene (Fig. 15.3): 1. 02- ion approaching o-xylene along the in-plane axis passing through the -CH2 group diagonally to the benzene ring II. 02- ion approaching o-xylene along the axis passing through the -CH2 group perpendicularly to the ring, the attack from below the plane. The other possible attacks, along the axis perpendicular to the benzene ring, or along the in-plane axis passing through other sites of the benzene ring, were assumed to be equivalent to the situations considered in the analysis of the reaction between oxygen and the benzene molecule as described earlier. Let us start with the analysis of the reaction between non-activated reagents (Fig. 15.1). When an oxygen molecule in its ground state approaches a non-activated o-xylene molecule along the in-plane axis between two methyl groups, the total energy of the system rises continuously, irrespective of the orientation of the axis of the oxygen molecule, indicating no attractive chemical interactions. Preliminary activation of oxygen by stretching its bond to the value of 1.49 A results in cleavage of the O-O bond along the reaction path and formation of the intermediate o-xylene-oxide-like product with the abstracted oxygen moving away to react further. This is true only for such mutual orientation in which the oxygen molecule with stretched O-O bond approaches the o-xylene molecule non-symmetrically with one oxygen atom out of plane (1.III). In the case of the reaction between activated o-xylene and oxygen molecule in the case of attack of oxygen oriented in plane of the ring on the -CH2 group, no interaction takes place (Fig. 15.2.1). The total energy of the system as a function of the reaction coordinate increases continuously. When oxygen attacks hydrocarbon with the 02 axis perpendicular to the ring plane, along the axis passing through the -CH2 group diagonally to the ring plane, the potential energy curve passes through a minimum at which oxygen is added side on to a carbon atom and a peroxide-type complex is formed (Fig. 15.2.11). The additional optimization of the angle between the 02 axis and the benzene ring favors the latter reaction pathway. 325 Let us finally pass to the case when atomic oxygen reacts with an activated o-xylene molecule (Fig. 15.3). When the oxygen ion approaches the -CHZ group in-plane, a methylbenzyl alcohol-like species is formed with the C-O and C-H bond lengths characteristic of the alcohol group (Fig. 15.3.1). For the case in which the oxygen ion interacts with the -CHZ group from below (above) the plane, a tolualdehyde-like product is obtained with a C-O bond distance typical of aldehydes or ketones (Fig. 15.3.II). It is worthy to note that no attractive interactions develop when the atomic oxygen ion approaches the non-activated o-xylene molecule. Oxidation of toL When the toluene molecule is oxidized, both benzene ring and aliphatic group may undergo this process. The following interesting questions arise: - to what extent does the presence of the methyl group on the benzene ring influence the reaction pathways concerning the oxidation of the ring which were found in the reaction between benzene and oxygen - what is the role of molecular oxygen in favoring the total oxidation of toluene in contrast to the oxidation of benzene in which maleic anhydride may be obtained with high selectivity. To analyse the oxidation of the toluene molecule the following reacting systems were taken into consideration: - non-activated toluene and oxygen molecule - activated toluene (abstraction of H atom from CH3 group) and dioxygen - non-activated toluene and atomic oxygen ion - activated toluene and atomic oxygen ion. Since both molecular and atomic oxygen may carry different charges, and moreover, in the course of the catalytic reaction the interaction with the surface of the catalyst entails the transfer of electrons between reactants and the catalyst, calculations were carried out for different numbers of electrons in the system, similar to the previously discussed oxidation processes. The most probable reaction pathways were selected on the basis of the simple potential energy maps. In-plane attack of the dioxygen molecule onto the toluene ring proceeds with low energy barrier and leads to the degradation of the molecule. The attack from above the plane, parallel to the diagonal is associated with a relatively high energy barrier corresponding to the stretching of the O-O bond and evolves further towards the transition state with bridging oxygen, which may undergo rearrangement to maleic anhydride. The attack of dioxygen onto the methylene group (activated toluene) is equivalent to the oxidation of activated o-xylene molecule. For example the attack of perpendicularly oriented OZ molecule onto the -CH2 group which in the case of o-xylene leads to o-xylene peroxide proceeds even easier in the case of toluene. When atomic oxygen approaches the non-activated toluene molecule the most probable direction of an attack is that perpendicular to the ring and pointing towards the ring C-H bond. The minima on the potential energy 326 maps, corresponding to the in-plane attack on the C=C bond of the ring as well as on the methyl group, are less pronounced. In the case where the reaction between activated toluene and atomic oxygen is studied, the most susceptible point of attack is the carbon atom of the -CHZ group. The results of the calculations obtained when discussing the oxidation of toluene confirm the conclusions drawn from the analysis of the oxidation of benzene and o-xylene molecules. The oxidation of both the aromatic ring and of the methyl group proceeds along similar pathways for benzene and for its alkyl substituted derivatives. In the literature one can find several articles concerning theoretical studies on the reactions between hydrocarbons and oxygen. Some are listed below in order to assist a search for other examples. Different aspects of the selective oxidation of propene to acrolein studied by performing ab initio calculations for all possible intermediates (propene, allyl cation, allyl anion) are discussed in [2171; the type of complex formed as the result of interaction between ethylene and ozone (O initio) was studied in [218], whereas the mechanism of oxygenation via electron transfer was proposed in [219]. Shaik [220] discusses the problem of barrier height for nucleophilic attack on cation radicals and cations. Reaction path calculations for the interaction of ethylene radical cation with triplet molecular oxygen are reported in [221] (MNDO). Reaction between singlet molecular oxygen and propylene is one of the subjects investigated by Yamaguchi et al. [222, 2231 and reviewed by Frimer [224]. The goal of the present calculations concerning the direct reaction between reactants was to answer the following fundamental questions: - what is the reactivity of the given molecule towards other molecules of the system, and which products may be formed as the result of such an interaction - how does the reactivity of the reactants towards each other vary by altering their electronic state (for example by activating one of the reactants) - what is the relation between the spatial arrangement of the reactants and the type of products formed in the course of the reaction - what is the molecular description of the reaction in terms of breaking and/or forming chemical bonds and in terms of the transfer of electrons among reactants and catalyst. Quantum chemical analysis of the reaction between different hydrocarbons and oxygen species leads to following general conclusions concerning the oxidation reactions: - the course of the oxidation process depends on the preliminary activation of reactants (hydrocarbon and/or oxygen) and on the mutual orientation of the reacting molecules; the systems react along different pathways depending on these factors, which are imposed by the properties of the active centers at the surface of the catalyst; - the type of product is determined by the site of oxygen attack; the attack onto the C=C double bond results in the splitting of the carbon skeleton 327 and leads to products of selective oxidation which have a smaller number of carbon atoms in comparison to reagents; attack on the carbon atom results in addition of oxygen and gives the products of allylic oxidation, i.e. the oxygenated species with the same number of carbons as the oxidized molecule; the degree of oxygenation (alcohol, aldehyde or ketone, acid) depends on the direction of the attack of oxygen species, in particular on the mutual arrangement of hydrogen atoms and attacking oxygen - in the presence of an electrophilic oxygen species the oxidation reaction always proceeds according to the electrophilic mechanism independent of the preliminary activation of the hydrocarbon molecule; the attack of electrophilic oxygen is faster than the activation of hydrocarbon; the abstraction of H atom from hydrocarbon molecule (activation of the molecule) opens new sites (atoms) for the electrophilic addition reactions; - oxidation reaction proceeds along the nucleophilic mechanism only under condition that no electrophilic oxygen species are available; - the role of the catalyst is to facilitate the transfer of electrons between reactants, which is a prerequisite for the reaction which cannot be effected directly. An adequate theoretical description of the catalytic reaction requires reasonable models for the bulk, the surface, the adsorbate-surface bond, chemical reaction and an appropriate theoretical treatments. One of the examples of the unifield approach to chemisorption and heterogeneous catalysis is the method proposed by Shustorovich and Baetzold [225]. The current theory is reliable and efficient enough to explain many experimental results, and provide data which are difficult to obtain experimentally. It can also suggest new ideas but only under the condition that it is used in a `smart' way. It is obvious that quantum chemical calculations cannot replace experiment and that in order to understand the mechanism of a catalytic reaction it is necessary to combine experience gained in experiments and theoretical treatments. The full solution of the problem concerning the mechanism of chemical reactions on the basis of first principles of quantum mechanics is still a distant objective because it requires a dynamic description. Such dynamic studies although quite extensive in the area of chemical reactions are still limited to simple reactions. Complete analysis of chemically important reactions, even by means of static approaches, usually demands sophisticated quantum chemical techniques like ab initio followed by CI calculations which are difficult to apply to catalytic processes because of the size of the systems discussed. Another problem is connected with the models used to mimic the surface of catalyst and the chemisorption process. It should be remembered that by definition the model is incomplete with respect to the real object. The goal of the model is the interpretation of the chemical reaction and the prediction of the behavior of the chemical system under conditions imposed by the surrounding environment. Different models referring to the same system usually select different features of the object and this is a reason why it is 328 valuable to compare various models. The criteria which the model should fulfill, as well as aspects of model design and of utilization of the model, are discussed in [226]. In order to understand the mechanism of catalytic reactions it is very convenient to look separately at different aspects of the problem, but finally it is necessary to combine the information obtained. A good example of such an approach is provided in the paper by Blyholder and Lawles [227], which analyses the similarities and differences among homogeneous catalysis, heterogeneous catalysis and uncatalyzed reaction. The aim of the present studies was to show that simple, semi-empirical quantum chemical methods are sometimes sufficient for this purpose and can offer a great deal of information regarding the mechanism of chemical reactions. The only limitation when using semi-empirical methods is to know their advantages and limitations, and to discuss the results within the limits of applicability of the methods used. References 1 R.

X244 9180127O 0304-5102(91)80127-O 10.1016/0304-5102(91)80127-O Review Oxidation of hydrocarbons on transition metal oxide catalysts — quantum chemical studies Małgorzata Witko Institute of Catalysis and Surface Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, ul, Niezapominajek, Cracow 30 239 Poland This review points out the role of quantum chemistry in understanding the mechanism of catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons on transition metal oxides and presents an overview of fundamental experimental information necessary to explain the elementary steps of these reactions. The problem of modelling heterogeneous catalysis is divided into three aspects: nature of the surface, interaction of atoms or molecules with the surface and the nature of the reactions occurring in the absence of catalyst. Each aspect is examined on the basis of the results obtained from quantum chemical calculations. Heterogeneous oxidation of both aliphatic (propene, butene-1) and aromatic (benzene, toluene, o-xylene) hydrocarbons is discussed as an example. References 1 R.K. Grasselli J.D. Burrington Adv.

        "dc:description": "This review points out the role of quantum chemistry in understanding the mechanism of catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons on transition metal oxides and presents an overview of fundamental experimental information necessary to explain the elementary steps of these reactions. The problem of modelling heterogeneous catalysis is divided into three aspects: nature of the surface, interaction of atoms or molecules with the surface and the nature of the reactions occurring in the absence of catalyst. Each aspect is examined on the basis of the results obtained from quantum chemical calculations. Heterogeneous oxidation of both aliphatic (propene, butene-1) and aromatic (benzene, toluene, o-xylene) hydrocarbons is discussed as an example.",
