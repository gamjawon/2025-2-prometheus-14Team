FeS/WS2 nanocomposites were synthesized by sulfurizing Fe2O3/WO3 powders obtained by a hydrothermal method. Many WS2 nanosheets with a thickness of less than 5 nm are scattered from a same center to form a flower-like microsphere while these FeS nanoparticles are attached to these WS2 nanosheets. When used as the photocatalyst, these FeS/WS2 nanocomposites have excellent activity under UV irradiation, which can be attributed to the large specific surface area and the charge separation effect in these two materials. So this paper shows a simple method to synthesize two-dimensional sulfide heterojunction for effective photocatalysis.

In particular, transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) [1] can form nanosheets with a thickness from a single layer to several nanometers due to their unique layered structure. Due to their smaller thickness, these TMD nanosheets have a larger surface area, which then increases the active sites on the surface and improves their activities [2]. As a result, these materials have been widely used in solar cells [3], lithium-ion batteries [4], photocatalysis [5,6] and other fields. For example, in the field of photocatalysis, the photocatalytic reaction mainly occurs at the interface between photocatalyst and solution, and a larger surface area is conducive to the photocatalytic reaction. Therefore, TMD nanosheets such as MoS2 [7], TiS2 [8], TaS2 [9] etc., are ideal materials for photocatalytic degradation which provide an effective approach to solving the environmental pollution. Among them, WS2 has drawn particular attention [10,11] and has been reported with high photocatalytic activity in the degradation of water pollution [12]. However, a photocatalyst with a single material has the shortage of low charge separation efficiency. Most of the photogenerated holes and electrons are recombined inside the photocatalyst so that these photogenerated carriers cannot migrate to the surface of photocatalyst. In order to enhance the charge separation, it is an effective approach to use heterostructures composed of two different materials. Due to the matching of energy band positions, the electrons in the conduction band of the first semiconductor will be transferred to the second semiconductor while the holes flow in the opposite direction [13–15]. This charge separation effect will greatly reduce the carrier recombination and improve the photocatalystic activity. Therefore, it is desired to synthesize a heterojunction photocatalyst composed of WS2 nanosheets and matched semiconductor to achieve a photocatalyst with super activity. In this paper, a FeS/WS2 heterojunction photocatalyst was prepared by a chemical vapor deposition method. These nanocomposites were characterized by various techniques. It is found that these WS2 nanosheets have a small thickness of less than 5 nm, which are scattered from a same center to form a flower-like microsphere. These FeS nanoparticles are embedded within these WS2 nanosheets. As photocatalysts, these FeS/WS2 nanocomposites show high photocatalytic activity in the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB). The separation of electrons and holes in this heterojunction makes the photocatalyst have superior activity. So this paper reports an efficient and simple method for preparing composites of ultra-thin WS2 nanosheets and other functional nanoparticles for effective photocatalysis. 2 Experimental Ferric chloride (FeCl3), ammonium tungstate ((NH4)10H2(W2O7)6) and sulfur powder (S) are used as the raw materials. At first, FeCl3 solution (0.12 mol/L) was drop-wise added to ammonium tungstate solution (0.005 mol/L) under magnetic stirring and heated in a water bath at 80 °C for 40 min. The amount of solution was set according to the molar ratio of Fe: W = 1:1. Then the precipitate was washed with deionized water several times and dried at 90 °C to obtain Fe2O3/WO3 powder. This powder was grounded before being used. The FeS/WS2 powder was prepared by sulfurizing the Fe2O3/WO3 powder (120 mg) in a traditional horizontal tube furnace with sulfur powder (2 g) placed upstream as the sulfur source. The pressure of the quartz tube was maintained at 30 mbar under an argon (99.999%) flow of 30 sccm (cubic centimetres per minute at STP). The center temperature was 550 °C and the temperature of sulfur powder was 200 °C, respectively. This temperature was maintained for 15 min under the presence of oxygen flow (0.50 sccm). Then the oxygen was shut off and the heating continued for another 15 min. Finally, the furnace was naturally cooled to room temperature. For comparison, a pure WS2 sample was synthesized by sulfurizing nanosized pure WO3 powder under the same conditions. The samples were characterized by scanning electron microscope (FESEM, FEI inspect F50), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Smartlab, Rigaku). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20) was used to analyze the morphology and crystal structure. To evaluate the photocatalytic activity, 15 mg of the photocatalyst was added to 30 mL of 6 × 10−5 M RhB solution. A 250 W high-pressure Hg lamp was used as the light source. The absorption was measured by using UV–visible spectrophotometer (shimadzu uv-2450) to determine the solution concentration. 3 Results and discussion The XRD patterns of FeS/WS2, Fe2O3/WO3 as well as pure WS2 are shown in Fig. 1 . In the sample of pure WS2, except the weak peaks at 22–24° come from WO3 for the incomplete sulfurization, the other peaks all originate from 2H-WS2. Through the comparison of the spectra of FeS/WS2 with pure WS2, it can be clearly noted that all the diffraction peaks marked as “*” correspond to 2H-WS2. Other peaks marked as “#” in FeS/WS2 can be indexed to orthorhombic FeS (JCPDS card No. 76–0965). All the peaks in the sample of FeS/WS2 can be ascribed to diffraction of FeS and WS2, which indicates the pure phase of the sample. These patterns indicate that the prepared FeS/WS2 heterojunction photocatalyst has good crystallinity. The XRD pattern of the oxide is also consistent with Fe2O3 and WO3. The SEM image shows of Fe2O3/WO3 nanoparticles. These particle distribution is relatively uniform with a size of about 30–100 nm. Fig. 2 (a) show the SEM images of FeS/WS2 while the inset is the SEM image with low magnification and large range. In inset of Fig. 2(a), it shows there are lots of quasi-spherical aggregates with a rough surface whose size is 1–4 μm. In the enlarged image (Fig. 2(a)), these aggregates consist of many nanosheets and nanoparticles. It can be clearly seen that the FeS/WS2 sample has a flower-like structure which is composed of WS2 nanosheets and FeS nanoparticles. The thickness of the WS2 nanosheets is about 5 nm. Obviously, the flower-like unfolding structure provides more surface area which is beneficial to improve the photocatalystic activity. Fig. 2(b) is the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image which is taken from the low resolution TEM images of the sample (rectangular area in the inset of Fig. 2(b)). The layered structure with the featured plane spacing of ∼0.62 nm is consistent with the reported value of WS2. The thickness of these WS2 nanostructure is about 3–6 layers. Additional to these WS2, there is a nanoparticle can be attributed to FeS nanoparticles. The lattice spacing of 0.26 nm is corresponding to the (211) or (121) crystal planes of FeS. This indicates these nanocomposites are composed of WS2 nanosheets and FeS nanoparticles. The EDX pattern of FeS/WS2 indicates that the W, S, and Fe are the dominant energy peaks. The ratio of W, Fe and S is W: Fe: S = 1: 0.92: 2.96. Therefore, it can be inferred that the composition of the FeS/WS2 heterojunction material is WS2 and FeS1.04. The W: Fe ration is close to 1:1 in the raw material. In the EDX mapping images (Fig. 3 ), the relative distribution of W, Fe, and S elements is the same as the corresponding SEM image (Fig. 3 ). Especially the distribution of Fe and W is uniform even at the flower edge. This once again confirms the material composition of FeS/WS2. These FeS/WS2 nanosheets show high photocatalystic activity in the degradation of RhB. Fig. 4 (a) shows the concentration of RhB solution as a function of time under UV light when using FeS/WS2, WS2 and Fe2O3/WO3 as the photocatalyst. It can be seen that the concentration of the RhB decreases a very little after 20 min of dark treatment, while it decreases quickly when turning on the light source. The decolour speed using FeS/WS2 as the photocatalyst is the fastest, which means this sample has the best photocatalystic activity. According to the pseudo first-order kinetic model, the dynamic curve in photocatalysis can be written as ln (C/C0) = −t/τ, in which τ is the time constant (Fig. 4(b)). By fitting the curves in Fig. 4 (b). The time constants of FeS/WS2, WS2, and Fe2O3/WO3 are 3.1, 8.0, and 33.7 min, respectively. This reflects that the catalytic performance of the FeS/WS2 heterojunction photocatalyst is 2.6 times higher than that of WS2 and more than 10.7 times higher than that of Fe2O3/WO3. This shows that FeS/WS2 has excellent photocatalytic properties for RhB, and the heterojunction structure of FeS/WS2 has more significant photocatalytic performance than a pure WS2 photocatalyst. Besides, these FeS/WS2 nanosheets maintain good photocatalytic performance even after seven times recycling (inset of Fig. 4(b)), which indicates the stability of the sample is good. The excellent photocatalytic performance of the FeS/WS2 heterojunction photocatalyst can be attributed to the following reasons. Firstly, this FeS/WS2 heterojunction has a unique expanded flower-like structure that can facilitate the diffusion of the solution. Especially the ultra-thin nanosheets synthesized by chemical vapor deposition have a larger surface area. Second, due to the energy band arrangement of FeS/WS2 heterojunction promoting the charge separation efficiency, the catalytic activity of photocatalytic degradation of organic molecules is greatly improved. Fig. 5 shows the schematic diagram of the photocatalystic mechanism and the energy band structure of FeS/WS2. The positions of the conduction band and valence band of FeS [16–18] are both higher than those of WS2 (Fig. 5) to form a type II heterostructure. The potential difference in the energy band level makes it easier for electrons in FeS transferring to WS2 while holes in WS2 diffussing to FeS. Thus, under the excitation of ultraviolet light, the photo-generated electrons and holes are separated and concentrated in WS2 and FeS, respectively. The photogenerated electrons react with dissolved oxygen molecules to form superoxide radical anion (O 2 ∙−) while holes interact with OH− to form hydroxyl radicals (•OH) with high reactivity, which has the ability to directly oxidize the pollution molecules. The charge separation effect makes more electrons and holes participating in the photocatalystic reaction. So the activity of FeS/WS2 is dramatically higher than that of pure WS2. 4 Conclusions In this paper, FeS/WS2 heterojunction photocatalyst materials were prepared by chemical vapor deposition. These heterojunction composites are composed of WS2 nanosheets and FeS nanoparticles with a flower-like morphology. As a photocatalyst, the results show that the FeS/WS2 heterojunction promotes the charge separation, which improves the photocatalytic activity so that they have better photocatalytic performance than pure WS2 catalyst. Therefore, these FeS/WS2 are ideal photocatalysts with great potential for the material in water purification.

        "dc:description": "FeS/WS2 nanocomposites were synthesized by sulfurizing Fe2O3/WO3 powders obtained by a hydrothermal method. Many WS2 nanosheets with a thickness of less than 5 nm are scattered from a same center to form a flower-like microsphere while these FeS nanoparticles are attached to these WS2 nanosheets. When used as the photocatalyst, these FeS/WS2 nanocomposites have excellent activity under UV irradiation, which can be attributed to the large specific surface area and the charge separation effect in these two materials. So this paper shows a simple method to synthesize two-dimensional sulfide heterojunction for effective photocatalysis.",
