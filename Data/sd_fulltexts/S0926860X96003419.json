As the test reactions, the reactions of decomposition of 2-propanol and diacetone alcohol as well as of ethylbenzene were employed. The obtained catalysts were also tested in hydrofining of coal liquid. It was observed that modification of the support with fluoride and chloride ions in the studied range of concentrations increases the acidity of the catalyst. A distinctly higher increase in acidity was obtained for the modification with F-ions than with C1- ions. The applied modifiers, on the one hand, lead to the increase in the activity of the catalysts in the reactions of decomposition of 2-propanol to propene, ethylbenzene to styrene, but on the other hand, reduce their activity in the decomposition of diacetone alcohol to acetone. Modification with C1- and F- ions only insignificantly affects the activity of catalysts in hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of coal liquid. Introduction of fluoride ions on the support of NiMo catalyst leads to a quite large increase of the activity in hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) of coal liquid, whereas, when modified with chloride ions, these catalysts bring about a decrease in the activity of the discussed reaction. The properties of catalysts generated by ions of the modifiers, in particular the type and strength of acid centers, play a significant role in the HDN of coal liquid.

Lewandowski, Z Sarbak/Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 181-192 toms from heavy petroleum fractions or coal liquids, reveal a low activity. One of the methods to increase their activity consists in increasing the temperature and hydrogen pressure in the process of hydrofining. There are however two flaws in such a method. First, the temperature increase leads to a rise in the amount of the forming carbonaceous deposit on the surface of catalyst, which contributes to its fast deactivation. Second, increase in the hydrogen pressure brings about a higher consumption of hydrogen, as a result of which the cost of hydrofining process rises. A very reliable method of improving the process of removing heteroatoms is development of a new preparation technique of a catalyst or application of a number of addtives increasing the activity of the catalysts of hydrofining. One of the most frequently applied modifiers increasing the activity of this kind of catalyst are fluoride ions [1-20]. Less frequently applied in these systems are chloride ions which, however, increase acidity and hydrodesulfurization activity (HDS) of catalysts [2,5]. The studies on modifications of fluoride ions of the catalyst of the NiMo/A1203 and CoMo/A1203 type proved that fluoride ions contribute to increasing both the acidity of support and hydrofining catalysts, and their activity in reactions taking place on acid centers [ 14,16,21-23]. Most attention was devoted to the influence of fluoride ions on the activity of hydrofining catalysts in the reactions of cracking and hydrocraking [16-18], hydrodesulfurization [1-10,19,24] and in the process of hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) [9-20]. The influence of fluoride ions on the activity of catalysts depends on many parameters, i.e. concentration of fluoride ions, reaction type, reaction temperature, the order of incorporation of F- ions upon the catalyst preparation. Boorman et al. [18] found out that modification with F- ions leads to the increase in the hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene and inhibits its isomerization. Jiratova and Kraus [5] observed an increase in both the hydrogenation and isomerization activity of cyclohexene. On the other hand, the HDS activity of thiophene of CoMo/A1203 catalyst, containing 3 wt.% of E also rises [5]. The amount of fluoride does not affect the type of molybdenum and nickel compounds which occur on the surface of catalysts. The presence of fluoride ions has an effect on the reduction or/and sulfiding of molybdenum and nickel ions in the deactivation process, and it increases the HDS activity of thiophene and of hydrodeoxygena- tion (HDO) of tetrahydrofurane [3,7,24]. It was found that small amounts of fluoride (0.3 and 0. 8 wt.% of F) increase in the number of active centers and in the dispersion the active phase of molybdenum and cobalt, which leads to a rise of the HDS activity of a catalyst. Bigger amounts of fluoride (2 wt.% F), on the other hand, reduce the number of active centers and the dispersion of molybdenum and cobalt [4]. Fluoride ions incorporated before molybdenum and cobalt ions increase HDS activity, and when incorporated in the last stage of impregna- tion decrease the HDS activity of the catalyst [4]. Chloride ions lead to the increase in the acidity, hydrogenation activity and the HDS activity of thiophene of the catalyst [2]. M. Lewandowski, Z. Sarbak/Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 181-192 183 Application of fluoride ions in catalyst preparation involves much work, while its substitution with chloride ions would be much more convenient. This is why in the present paper, the influence of modification of chloride and fluoride ions on the physicochemical properties and hydrofining activity of coal liquid, and in parti- cular the hydrodenitrogenation activity, was studied. The studies permitted comparison of the influence of both ions on the activity of NiMo/A1203. 2. Experimental The T-A1203 support, chloride and flouride containg NiMo/A1203 and their preparation have been described in detail elsewhere [25]. Briefly, alumina was prepared from aluminum isopropanolate (ALICO, Great Britain) which was hydrolyzed in distilled water at 60. Thus formed aluminum hydroxide was left for one week, and then subjected to filtering, drying and calcinating at 550 for 24 h. The support (256m2 g-l) were subject to modification with chloride and fluoride ions by incipient wetness impregnation using solutions of NH4C1 and NH4F respectively. The impregnated samples were dried at 120 for 4 h and calcined in air at 550 for 6 h. Preparation of 4% Nit and 11% MoO3 (by weight) sample supported on anion modified aluminas was carried out by two steps incipient wetness impregnations on the modified aluminas with (NH4)6Mo7024.4H20 at pH 6.5 and then with Ni(NO3)2 followed by drying in air for 4 h at 120 and calcination in air for 550 after each step. These catalysts have been characterized by BET method for surface area and porous structure determination. Thermogravimetry and infrared spectroscopy were also applied to characterize structural changes of sample after final preparation [25]. 2.1. Denotation of the catalysts The catalyst incorporated on an unmodified alumina was marked as NiMo. Anion modifications were noted with an appropriate letter or digit symbol. Digits from 1-4 correspond to concentrations of a modifier expressed by an atomic ratio of the number of atoms of the modifier to 20 alumina atoms of the support 1 - 1 : 20, 2 - 2 : 20, 3 - 3 : 20, 4 - 4 : 20. The fluoride modifications were denoted as F1, F2, F3, F4 (1.6, 3.1, 4.5, 5.9 wt.% F respectively), while the chloride ones as Cll, Cl2, Cl3, C14 F4 (2.9, 5.6, 8.1, 10.4 wt.% C1 respectively). 2.2. Decomposition of 2-propanol The activity studies of the catalysts obtained were conducted in a microreactor (of the length 100 mm, diameter 8 mm) at the temperature of 350+1. In the 184 M. Lewandowski, Z. Sarbak/Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 181-192 reactor 0.250 g of the catalyst with the grain size of 0.8-1.0 mm were placed. The carrier gas, purified and dried nitrogen, was made to flow at the rate of 30 cm3 min-1 through a thermostated evaporator at 15 containing 2-propanol. Then, a mixture of nitrogen and isopropyl alcohol vapor was made to flow through a layer of catalyst covered with a 1 cm layer of quartz of the same grain size. The calculated contact time for these conditions expressed by a ratio W/F was equal to 109 g h mo1-1 (W - weight of the catalyst, F - molar flow rate). The formed reaction products and the unreacted alcohol were separated in a gas chromatograph Chrom 4 (Czechoslovakia) with a flame-ionization detector at 70. The separa- tion process was carried on a column of the length of 2 m filled with a Chromosorb WAW with a 10% Carbowax 20M. Samples for chromatographic analysis were taken periodically, using the dosing valve. The first sample was taken after 5 min of the reaction, and then for 4 h at 15 min intervals. The products were identified on the basis of measurements of the retention time, and for quantitative analysis calibration curves were used. 2.3. Ethylbenzene decomposition The study on the catalytic decomposition of ethylbenzene was carried out according to a procedure described for isopropyl alcohol under the following conditions: reaction temperature catalyst weight rate of the nitrogen flow chromatographic column OV-17 separation temperature 460 0.150 g 30 cm3 min-J 2m IO0 In the applied conditions, contact time characterized by a W/F ratio, was equal to 123 g h mol-l. 2.4. Decomposition of diacteone alchol Catalytic decomposition of diacetone alcohol was carried out according to the above described procedure under the following conditions: reaction temperature catalyst weight rate of the nitrogen flow chromatographic column OV-17 separation temperature 70 0.250 g 30 cm3 min-1 2m 70 M.

Hydrofining (hydrodesuifurizatzon, hydrodenitrogenation) coal liquid The study of the obtained catalysts in the hydrofining reaction of coal liquid was carded out using a high-pressure laboratory flow installation microreactor type OL-105/109 (Hungary), equipped with a thermostated system of the material dosing and the products collection, and a hydrogen drying and deoxidizing system. The main element of the installation is a reactor of the length 100 mm) of a 186 M. Lewandowski, Z Sarbak/Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 181-192 qP Fig. 1.

The diagram of the installation is presented in Fig. 1. Hydrofining was carded out at 400 under hydrogen pressure of 9.0 MPa (90 atm) and at the volume rate of the material 1 h-1. The size of the samples of the studied catalysts was 0.8-1.0 mm. Coal liquid - a hydrogenation product from an uncatalytic process liquidation of coal from the Mine \"Janina\" in Libiaz near Chrzanowo (Poland), from an installation applied in the Main Mining Institute in Tychy-Wyry, was used as the material. The boiling point of the hydrogenation product ranged from 195 to 430, and up to 350 43.1% of the fraction was distilled. The content of nitrogen in the hydrogenation product was equal to 5600 ppm (0.56%), while that of sulphur 25000 ppm (2.5%). The samples for analyzing the content of nitrogen and sulphur were taken after 12 h of the process. The content of sulfur and nitrogen was determined in the analyzer of nitrogen and sulfur made by \"Antek Instruments\", model 707C (USA), using the chemi- luminescence detection. The degree of denitrogenization (SN) and desulfurization (SO) was calculated from the formulas: SN (Ns - Np) (Ss - Sp) - x 100%; SO- x 100% Ns Ss where: Ns - content of nitrogen in the material Np - content of nitrogen in the product Ss - content of sulfur in the material Sp - content of sulfur in the product. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was submitted to the process of sulfiding, using dimethyldisulfide (DMDS) according to the following procedure: 1. dosing of the material containing 1.5% of DMDS, under the pressure of 3.0 MPa of hydrogen, at 200 for 2 h M. Lewandowski, Z. Sarbak/Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 181-192 187 2. dosing of the material containing 1.5% of DMDS, under the pressure of 3.0 MPa of hydrogen, at 310, for 4 h. 3. dosing of the material containing 1.5% of DMDS, under the pressure of 9.0 MPa of hydrogen, at 400, for 4 h. The volume rate of the material in the sulfiding process was 2 h-1. 3. Results and discussion The results of studies of catalytic activity in model reactions of 2-propanol diacetone alcohol and ethylbenzene decomposition were presented in Tables 1 and 2. 3.1. Catalysts modified with flouride ions Both fluoride modifications and unmodified NiMo/A1203 catalysts, catalyzed 2- propanol decomposition mainly to propene, and only to a slight degree to acetone. However, fluoride modifications were more active in decomposition of 2-propanol to propene compared to unmodified NiMo catalyst. Since the Bronsted and Lewis acid centers are responsible for 2-propanol dehydration [26], increase in the yield of propene is related to the increase of the acidity of the catalysts. In our case, the yield of propene rose with increasing concentration of fluoride ions. The exception was catalyst F3 for which propene yield was slightly lower than that for F2 and F4 catalysts. Based on the above results, we can conclude that, increase of acidity of fluoride modified A1203, caused an increase of the acidity of NiMo catalysts. In explanation to this phenomenon, we can assume that, fluoride ions exchange hydroxyl groups on A1203 surface and rise also the acid strength of non-protonic centers [23,27]. Morever, increase in the floride contents up to 10 wt%, results in an increase in the amount of Brtinsted centers, and a decrease in the number of Lewis centers [22,28,29]. Formation of Brtinsted acid centers and increase of strength of Lewis ones is due to the inductive effect of strong electronegativity of fluoride ions [3O]. It should be stressed that modification of the support with fluoride ions did not practically have any effect on the yield of acetone in 2-propanol decomposition (except the F2 catalyst). This proves that the surface of the catalyst carries basic centers, while the low yields of acetone in the decomposition of diacetone alcohol suggest that only a small portion of basic centers possess sufficient strength to take part in this reacton. F1-F4 catalysts revealed higher activity in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation to styrene (Table 2). The highest dehydrogenation activity was obtained for F2 188 M. Lewandowski, Z Sarbak/Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 181-192 Table 3 Catalytic hydrodenitrogenation and hydrodesulfurization activity on NiMo/A1203catalysts contained fluoride and chloride ions.

Simultaneously, decrease in the yield of benzene for F l-F4 catalysts was observed. These results provide grounds for a conclusion that addition of fluoride ions leads to a considerable decrease in the number of strong acid centers, since dealkylation requires the strong acid centers [26]. Hydrofining activity (HDS, HDN) of coal liquid are presented in Table 3. The obtained results showed that catalysts containing fluoride ions reveal higher HDN activity than the NiMo catalyst. On the other hand, addition of fluoride ions did not practically affect the HDS activity of the catalysts. In fact, the influence of fluoride ions on the HDS activity has not been univocally identified. Jiratova and Kraus [5] reported an increase in the HDS activity of thiophene as a model compound on catalysts containing 3% of fluoride, which they explained by the inductive effect increasing the acidity of the Lewis acid centers of Mo, which improves the ability of the catalyst to hydrogenolize the C-S bond. Muralidhar et al. [2] found that for the cobalt-molybdenum catalyst the HDS activity rises when the content of fluoride ions is low (0.5 wt.%) and falls for higher fluoride concentrations (5 wt.%). The authors [6,24] studied the HDS activity of thiophene for the CoMo/A1203 and NiMo2/A1203 catalysts modified with fluoride ions and they reported an increase in the HDS activity for a sample containing 0.2 wt% of F-. Further rise of the content of F- (to 2 wt.%) caused an increase in HDS activity only in the case of catalyst NiMo. Kordulis et al. [7] also reported an increase in the HDO and HDS activity, which they explained by a growing number of active centers and increasing strength of these centers. Different conclusions can be drawn from the papers of Lewis et al. [8] and Veen et al.[9] as they did not observe any influence of fluoride ions on the HDS activity of NiMo/A1203 catalysts. M. Lewandowski, Z Sarbak/Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 181-192 189 As we can see from the details mentioned above, several explanations are given which try to explain HDS of thiophene, however, no explanation is simple. Comparison of thiophene hydrodesulfurization as test reaction with hydrode- sulfurization of coal liquid leads to conclusion that neither acidic nor basic centres are responsible for this reaction. The effect of fluoride ions on HDN activity of catalysts is different. Addition of fluoride ions brought about an increase in HDN activity of the F1-F4 catalysts. On the basis of the comparison of the HDN and HDS processes it can be claimed that a change in the acidity of catalyst significantly affects the HDN process. The obtained results permit a conclusion that a rise of the HDN activity of catalysts containing fluoride ions is caused by increase in their acidity as well as by structural changes of the active phase on the surface of the support. This conclusion is confirmed by other reports proving that fluoride ions increase dispersion of molybdenum on a support [7,31] as well as decrease the amount of inactive spinel phase NiA1204 [31,32], in consequence leading to a rise of the active phase NiMoS, particularly of the second type which is a more acidic phase [9]. The rise in catalytic activity may also be related to the possibility of fluoride ions to directly react with active centers of the catalyst [11,33] and to a diminishing ability for coking catalysts containing fluoride ions [3,34]. 3.2. Catalysts modified with chloride ions Modification with chloride ions has a different effect on the activity of the nickel-molybdenum catalyst. In the decomposition reaction of 2-propanol, for catalyst Cll (Table 1) the yield of propene was lower than for catalyst NiMo. Further increase in the content of chloride ions of catalyst C13 resulted in a further increase in propene to 39.9%. Catalyst C14 of the highest concentration of chloride ions showed the same dehydratation activity as catalyst C13. For catalysts Cll and C12, increase in acetone yield was observed, respectively to 3.2 and 3.3%. Catalysts C13 and C14, on the other hand, only slightly lowered acetone yield relative to catalyst NiMo. In the reaction of decomposition of diacetone alcohol to acetone (Table 1), for these catalysts, and for the catalysts modified with fluoride ions, the yield of acetone was very low. In the reaction of ethylbenzene decomposition to styrene (Table 2), in the case of Cll-C14 catalysts the yield of styrene was lower than in the case of fluoride catalysts, but higher than for NiMo catalyst. Of all the above catalysts, the maximum yield of styrene was noticed for catalyst Cll. On the other hand, modification with chloride ions only insignificantly lowered the HDS activity of the catalysts (Table 3), but caused a large decrease in the HDN activity. Cll catalyst with the lowest concentration of chloride ions revealed only slightly lower HDN activity than the unmodified NiMo catalyst, while a lower activity in this reaction was observed for catalyst C12. The literature data do not 190 M. Lewandowski, Z Sarbak/Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 181-192 provide enough grounds for a claim what centers are generated as a result of modification with C1- ions, and ultimately, the centers responsible for the activity. Ayama and Sawara [35] reported a lack of Brtinsted acidity and strong basic centers on alumina as well as a presence of only Lewis acid centers after modification with chloride ions. Marczewski et al. [36] claimed that chloride ions lead to a total elimination of surface OH groups and rise the acidity of Lewis centers. Ayama and Imanishi [37] discovered the maximum activity in the reaction of alkylation of benzene with chloropropane for alumina contained chloride ions and calcined within the temperature range 700-800. On the other hand, Curtin et al. [38], using the method of programmed desorption of ammonia, showed that the number of acid centers does not change after modification with chloride ions. Our studies have shown that a change in the acidity of the support induces a change in the acidity of the catalyst which is reflected in the rise of propene yield in the reaction of 2-propanol decomposition (Table 1). In the case of samples modified with chloride ions, increase in the acidity of catalysts does not increase the HDN activity (Table 3), on the contrary, it lowers it. Such a behavior is probably related to the increase in the coking abilities of the catalyst and to a decrease in dispersion of active phase on the support. Garbowski and Primet [39] found a strong adsorption of benzene on A1203 containing chloride ions, and a formation of a hexadiene cation as a precursor of coke deposition. It follows from the performed studies that modification with both chloride and fluoride ions similarly affects the activity of modified catalysts. Both ions cause an increase in the acidity, dehydrogenating activity and they reveal a similar HDS activity. The basic difference between the two modifications is observed in the process of hydrodenitrogenation (HDN). In spite of the fact that modifications with chloride ions did not significantly lower the specific surface area of the catalyst [25] and at the same time caused an increase in its acidity, the HDN activity was considerably reduced. As it is implied by the previous data [40], the hydrodenitrogenation reaction proceeds through the stage of hydrogenation of aromatic ring with nitrogen, and then through hydrogenolysis of the C-N bond. Hydrogenation takes place on anion vacancies of Mo-S, while the breaking of the C-N bond is related to Br6nsted acid centers. In the process of hydrofining, high hydrogen pressure was applied, and therefore the step of hydrogenation of heterocyclic ring is not the step limiting the HDN process. This suggests that in the process the major role is played by C-N bond hydrogenolysis. As it follows from the literature data, modification with fluoride ions increases mainly Brtinsted acidity [22,28,29] and this is the reason why it causes an increase of the activity of hydrogenolysis of the C-N bond. Under the same conditions, chloride ions cause an increase in Lewis-type acidity [29,36] and a decrease in the activity of the C-N bond hydrogenolysis. In the light of the above mention results indicating that Lewis acid centers catalyze the reaction of M. Lewandowski, Z. Sarbak/Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 181-192 191 dehydrogenation and condensation, and not the reaction of denitrogenation it becomes clear why a decrease in HDN activity takes place. Another factor lowering th HDN activity of chloride catalysts is their lower resistance to coking. This factor is so important because raw materials submitted to hydrofining are characterized by a high degree of aromaticity. Unlike chloride catalysts, the fluoride catalysts reveal a high resistance to coke deposition [3,34]. Decrease in the resistance of catalysts to coking is related to the increase of the number of Lewis acid centers, because these acid centers are known to cause coking [12]. Comparing the yield of propene in decomposition of 2-propanol (Table 1) with the hydrodenitrogenation (Table 3) activity of chloride catalysts it can be noticed that C11 catalyst with the lowest yield of propene showed the highest HDN activity. In spite of the fact, that the acidity of the other chloride catalysts was higher, their HDN activity was lower. It can be supposed then that in the case of chloride modifications the decrease in HDN activity was mainly due to their lower resistance to coking. There is also another factor which may be responsible for the increase in the activity of catalysts modified with fluoride ions. In many papers [41,42] it was claimed that the maximum activity in the HDS reaction was revealed by catalysts with a 2-4% content of fluoride. Our study has shown, however, that in the HDN process the highest activity was observed for catalyst F4 (Table 3) with the highest content of fluoride which considerably exceeded 3.6 wt.%. It was proved that for the higher fluoride content 13-A1F3 phase and A1F2OH are formed [41,42] on the surface of the catalyst. It can be supposed therefore that the formed phase of alumina fluoride may be also the phase active in HDN process as well as in other processes occurring parallely during hydrofining. Hess et al. [42] found that on ~- A1F3 the adsorption of ammonia is greater than on the samples without alumina fluoride. Introduction of fluoride ions on the support of catalyst NiMo leads to a quite significant increase of HDN activity of coal liquid, whereas modifications with chloride ions cause a decrease in the activity in the reaction under study. 4. Conclusions On the basis of the obtained data it can be claimed that modification of the support with fluoride and chloride ions increases the acidity of the catalyst within their concentration. Acidity appeared to rise more for modifications with fluoride than with chloride ions. The applied modifiers affect the activity of nickel- molybdenum catalysts in a different way. On one hand, both types of ions cause an increase of the activity of catalysts in the reaction of decomposition of 2- propanol, ethylbenzene to styrene, and on the other hand, decrease their activity in decomposition of diacetone alcohol to acetone. Modification with C1- and F- ions only slightly affects the activity of catalysts in HDS of coal liquid. Properties of the 192 M. Lewandowski. Z. Sarbak/Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 181-192 support, generated by the modifying ions, in particular the type and strength of its acid centers, play an important role in the HDN process of coal liquid.

A series of studies on NiMo catalysts incorporated on to Al2O3 modified with chloride and fluoride ions was carried out. As the test reactions, the reactions of decomposition of 2-propanol and diacetone alcohol as well as of ethylbenzene were employed. The obtained catalysts were also tested in hydrofining of coal liquid. It was observed that modification of the support with fluoride and chloride ions in the studied range of concentrations increases the acidity of the catalyst. A distinctly higher increase in acidity was obtained for the modification with F− ions than with Cl− ions. The applied modifiers, on the one hand, lead to the increase in the activity of the catalysts in the reactions of decomposition of 2-propanol to propene, ethylbenzene to styrene, but on the other hand, reduce their activity in the decomposition of diacetone alcohol to acetone. Modification with Cl− and F− ions only insignificantly affects the activity of catalysts in hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of coal liquid. Introduction of fluoride ions on the support of NiMo catalyst leads to a quite large increase of the activity in hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) of coal liquid, whereas, when modified with chloride ions, these catalysts bring about a decrease in the activity of the discussed reaction. The properties of catalysts generated by ions of the modifiers, in particular the type and strength of acid centers, play a significant role in the HDN of coal liquid.
