Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology Kunming China Due to the expensive cost of precious metals, there is an urgent need to develop cheap and efficient catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a novel catalyst, high-entropy alloy (HEA) has found widespread application in the field of hydrogen production through water electrolysis. However, a significant portion of HEA catalysts prepared by traditional solvothermal methods are challenging due to their high cost, extended compound cycle, and relatively difficult electronic structure adjustment in the catalytic center. In this study, a heterostructure catalyst composed of MoC and FeCoNiMo HEA alloy (denoted as FeCoNiMo-M) was synthesized by the microwave method. Catalysts produced via the microwave method typically exhibit MoC encloses the spherical heterostructure of the internal high entropy alloy, MoC not only protects the true active center NiOOH, but even further regulates the electronic structure of the catalyst. Notably, the FeCoNiMo-M sample synthesized using microwave demonstrates an overpotential of merely 232 mV (@10 mA cm−2) in 1 M KOH, nearly 20 mV lower compared to the traditional hydrothermally-synthesized FeCoNiMo-H HEA catalyst. Furthermore, the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst demonstrates impressive durability in OER with a significant current density of 100 mA cm−2 for a duration of 240 hours. The in-situ Raman results indicate that the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst undergoes the conversion of the actual reaction intermediate NiOOH and accelerates the OER with only a very low overpotential. These findings suggest that our approach could open up possibilities for the advancement of OER catalysts that are both more convenient and efficient. Graphical Abstract This work demonstrates the first preparation of highly efficient and stable FeCoNiMo-MoC (FeCoNiMo-M) heterostructure catalysts through microwave method for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The FeCoNiMo-M catalyst displays an overpotential of 232 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and impressive durability in OER with a significant current density of 100 mA cm−2 for a duration of 240 hours. The operando Raman analyses indicate that the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst undergoes the conversion of the actual reaction intermediate NiOOH and accelerates the OER with only a very low overpotential.

The utilization of water electrolysis as an environmentally friendly and sustainable approach for hydrogen production has garnered considerable attention [4,5]. The huge overpotential resulting from the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction is the main problem faced by water electrolysis for hydrogen production [6]. At present, precious metal catalysts are considered the standard catalysts for OER reactions and have been used commercially. However, these catalysts exhibit poor stability and are prohibitively expensive [7–9]. High-entropy alloys (HEAs) consisting of four or more metals are considered ideal for substituting precious metal OER catalysts due to their advantages. High-entropy alloys adjust the ratio of different components to reduce the precious metal content [10–12]. For instance, Jing et al. synthesized an AlNiCoIrMo HEA, exhibiting superior OER performance compared to commercial IrO2 [13]. By changing the composition of the HEA, more reactive sites can be provided, and its electronic structure can be changed, so that it has excellent OER activity and stability. Li et al. [14] by means of one-step molten salt electrolysis of solid oxides prepared FeCoNiMnMo HEA, which shows as low as 279 mV overpotential (at 10 mA cm−2) as well as exbibits an outstanding stability in an alkaline environment. HEA have demonstrated significant potential as OER catalysts, but a significant portion of HEA catalysts prepared by traditional solvothermal methods are challenging due to their high cost, extended compound cycle, and relatively difficult electronic structure adjustment in the catalytic center. In practical applications, the performance of catalysts depends on many factors, so it is necessary to adjust the electronic density of HEA through interface engineering. The direct contact between the two phases of heterogeneous structures can change the electron distribution of the interface active centers, increase the adsorption strength of intermediates, and significantly improve the kinetics of the OER reaction [15–17]. Zheng et al. [18] used the rapid Joule heating shock strategy to synthesize FeCo/(FeCo)S heterogeneous catalysts, resulting in an overpotential of 287 mV (@10 mA cm−2). Xu et al. [19] constructed a multi-dimensional nano-porous interpenetrating phase FeNi3 and FeNiZn alloy heterostructure (FeNiZn/FeNi3@NiFe) in situ on FeNi alloy, which exhibited a low overpotential of 267 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm−2 and excellent stability of 400 h. It is noteworthy that in our prior research, we found that introducing Mo into FeCoNi can regulate the electronic structure between high-entropy alloys, causing changes in the adsorption of intermediates in the OER process. Molybdenum carbide (MoC) has also been widely used in OER due to its excellent conductivity and stability. Liu et al. [20] prepared the MoC-FeNi heterostructure catalyst using the high-temperature annealing method. Such examples demonstrate that alloy heterostructures can effectively accelerate the reaction kinetics of OER and improve the stability of catalysts. In addition, the efficient preparation of heterostructures and the role of interface engineering in enhancing OER activity are challenging. Herein, the FeCoNiMo-MoC heterogeneous catalyst (FeCoNiMo-M) was prepared efficiently by the microwave method. Microwave heating creates a superhot spot, leading to rapid nucleation and growth, and the rapid nucleation growth occurs at the superhot spot as well as strengthening the coupling between the interfaces. Meanwhile, MoC is reduced and formed at a transiently high temperature, which wraps and attaches to the surface of the high-entropy alloy, ultimately forming a heterogeneous structure. Expressly, compared to the FeCoNiMo-H HEA catalyst, the OER activity has been significantly improved, and the preparation period is significantly shortened. The FeCoNiMo-M catalyst demonstrates an overpotential as low as 232 mV (@10 mA cm−2) below FeCoNiMo-H HEA, approximately 20 mV in alkaline medium. Simultaneously, the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst demonstrated remarkable OER stability for 240 hours (@100 mA cm−2) with almost no change in overpotential. In addition, in-situ Raman results demonstrate that MoC accelerates the transformation into intermediate O (II-δ) -, thereby speeding up the conversion into actual intermediate Ni-OOH and also protecting Ni as the actual active site from oxidation. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Preparation of FeCoNiMo-M catalyst Initially, 0.082 g of Ni(NO₃)₂·6 H₂O, 0.053 g of Fe(CO₂CH₃)₂·4 H₂O, 0.081 g of Co(NO₃)₂·6 H₂O, and 0.067 g of H₂₄Mo₇N₆O₂₄·4 H₂O were dissolved in 10 ml of deionized (DI) water and subjected to ultrasound for 30 minutes. Simultaneously, 0.02 g of graphene oxide (GO) and 0.03 g of carbon nanotubes (CNT) were dissolved in 30 ml of deionized (DI) water and sonicated for half an hour. The two solutions were then combined and stirred for 12 hours. Subsequently, the resulting solution underwent freezing and drying in a vacuum freeze dryer. Following this step, the dried sample was placed in a quartz bottle, ventilated for 15 minutes, and the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst was obtained by irradiating it in the microwave for 5 minutes (The microwave equipment used is a Galanz microwave oven, with a rated power of 700 W and an electromagnetic wave frequency of 2.45 GHz. The highest instantaneous temperature that can be reached during the reaction process is 1500°C.). 2.2 Preparation of FeCoNiMo-H HEA The process continued with the dissolution of 0.082 g of Ni(NO₃)₂·6 H₂O, 0.053 g of Fe(CO₂CH₃)₂·4 H₂O, 0.081 g of Co(NO₃)₂·6 H₂O, and 0.067 g of H₂₄Mo₇N₆O₂₄·4 H₂O in 10 ml of deionized (DI) water, followed by ultrasound for 30 minutes. Subsequently, 0.02 g of graphene oxide (GO) and 0.03 g of carbon nanotubes (CNT) were dissolved in 30 ml of deionized (DI) water and sonicated for half an hour. The two solutions were mixed and stirred for 12 hours. Afterward, the mixed solution underwent hydrothermal heating at 120 °C for 24 hours after being transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-lined autoclave. After being obtained hydrothermally, the sample was cleaned using DI water and anhydrous ethanol (EtOH), and subsequently dried in an electric oven at 70 °C for 12 hours. The FeCoNiMo (hydrothermal) HEA (denoted as FeCoNiMo-H) underwent pre-treatment at 350 °C remain 1 hour before being subjected to calcination in the tube furnace. The tube furnace was filled with a mixed gas of H₂/Ar (5% H₂). The temperature was then gradually increased to 450 °C at a rate of 5 °C per minute and held steady for 2 hours. 2.3 Characterization and electrochemical test The structure of the sample was investigated by XRD. The morphology and internal structure of the two synthesized samples were investigated using SEM and HAADF-STEM. EDS and ICP-OES were aimed at exploring the distribution of elements as well as the content of metals. Using EPR to verify the amount of oxygen vacancy (OV). In the meantime, the surface reconstruction and reaction mechanisms in the process of OER were investigated using in situ Raman spectroscopy. Additional electrochemical test details are presented in SI. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Materials characterization FeCoNiMo-M and FeCoNiMo-H high-entropy alloy (HEA) catalysts were synthesized using the microwave method and the solvothermal method. The preparation process of the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst is illustrated in Fig. 1a. The FeCoNiMo-M catalyst's XRD patterns showed no observable metal oxide peaks, as shown in Fig. 1b. The FeCoNiMo-M catalyst showed more intensity in its diffraction peaks with discernible variations as compared to the FeCoNiMo-H HEA catalyst. These findings confirm that the HEA/MoC heterostructure catalysts were successfully produced, with improved crystallinity obtained using the microwave technique [21]. The FeCoNiMo-M HEA catalyst's XRD pattern showed peaks close to 43.7°, 50.8°, and 74.7°. These peaks matched the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) planes of the face-centered cubic structure that is typical of high-entropy alloys. The FeCoNiMo-M catalyst's XRD pattern showed notable MoC peaks, which were related to the reduction of Mo cations brought on by the microwave treatment's brief high temperature. The peaks close to 35.1°, 39.3°, and 42.6° belong to the (1 0 1), (1 0 3), and (1 0 4) planes of the MoC (Fig. 1b). It validates that the high-entropy alloy/MoC heterostructure catalyst (FeCoNiMo-M) was successfully synthesized. FeMo oxide is responsible for a few other peaks that were found at different locations for the FeCoNiMo-H HEA catalyst (Fig. 1c). This further proves that microwave-assisted synthesis of catalysts is superior to conventional methods. Moreover, a comparison with the standard alloy cards of Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo revealed the successful formation of the HEA structure, and the resultant lattice distortion is indicated by a specific degree of shift in the position of diffraction peaks [22,23]. Concurrently, the two samples underwent chemical constitution analysis using ICP-OES. The consequences reveal that the metal content of the FeCoNiMo-M sample was 59.37%, significantly higher than that of FeCoNiMo-H at 34.42% (Table S1). Based on this data, the entropy of FeCoNiMo-M was calculated as 1.38 R, providing further evidence for the successful synthesis of the quaternary high-entropy alloy FeCoNiMo-M. The morphology of the FeCoNiMo-M heterostructure catalyst revealed nanospheres enveloped by sheets ( Fig. 2a, b). The outer layer of the catalyst distinctly exhibited a flake-like MoC, attributed to the transient high temperature induced by microwaves and the mutual coupling between interfaces. Conversely, the FeCoNiMo-H HEA catalyst showcased distinct nanoparticle clusters (Fig. 2d, e). Through EDS mappings of the two HEA catalysts, the added metal elements were observed to be evenly distributed within the HEA nanostructure (Fig. 2c, f). FeCoNiMo-M catalyst exhibited varying nanoparticle sizes, with a minimum size of 36.1 nm shown in Fig. 2g (labeled as A) and Figs. S1 and S2. Additionally, three nanoparticles with different lattices were identified to obtain more reliable information, as indicated in Fig. 2g and j (marked as A, B, and C). Fig. 2h displayed lattice spacings of 1.76 and 2.14 Å, which were assigned to the HEA face-centered cubic fcc (2 0 0) and MoC (1 0 4) lattice planes, respectively. Simultaneously, lattice spacings of 1.79 and 2.51 Å were attributed to HEA fcc (2 0 0) and MoC (1 0 1) (Fig. 2i), as well as 2.05 and 2.25 Å were pertained to HEA fcc (1 1 1) and MoC (1 0 3) (Fig. 2k). The FeCoNiMo-H HEA displayed lattice spacings of 2.04 and 2.74 Å and were assigned to the HEA face-centered cubic fcc (1 1 1) and FeMoO (1 0 3) lattice planes (Fig. S2h). This further corroborates the experimental results from XRD and SEM, where the transient high temperature generated by microwaves first forms a high-entropy alloy in a reducing atmosphere, then reduces Mon+ to MoC at higher temperatures, and the strong interfacial coupling between the generated superhot spots further encapsulates it around the HEA and gives rise to the FeCoNiMo-M heterostructure catalyst. The FFT pattern of the three marked areas exhibited clear crystal plane reflections (as shown in Fig. 2n, p, and S3). Compared with the FeCoNiMo-H HEA catalyst, these results further confirm that we have prepared MoC-HEA heterogeneous catalysts quickly and efficiently through the microwave method. The XPS spectra of FeCoNiMo-M and FeCoNiMo-H catalysts are depicted in Fig. 3 and Figs. S4 and S5. In the FeCoNiMo-H Fe 2p spectra, the peaks at 709.9 eV correspond to Fe0 2p3/2 and 723.2 eV belong to Fe0 2p1/2, respectively [24]. The Fe0 peaks of FeCoNiMo-M exhibit a positive displacement relative to FeCoNiMo-H (Fig. 3a). The peaks at 778.6 belong to Co0 2p3/2, and 794 eV vest in Co0 2p1/2 (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, there is a peak at 853.4 eV corresponding to Ni0 2p3/2 and another peak at 871.4 eV corresponding to Ni0 2p1/2 [25–28]. Conspicuously, the Ni0 and Co0 peaks of FeCoNiMo-M also show slight movement compared to FeCoNiMo-H (Fig. 3b, c). This displacement may be attributed to the rapid heating and formation of local hot spots during the synthesis process using the microwave method. Such conditions can affect the crystal structure and morphology of the material, leading to changes in the material's band and electronic structure [29]. It is also observed that the characteristic rapid high-temperature reduction of the microwave method enhances the synergistic electron coupling between Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo atoms [30–32]. In the FeCoNiMo-M Mo 3d spectra, there are two spin doublets at 228.6 eV (Mo0 3d5/2) and 231 eV (Mo0 3d3/2), indicating the existence of metallic Mo in FeCoNiMo-M, and the peaks at 230.3 and 233.9 eV corresponded to Mo4+ 3d5/2 and Mo4+ 3d3/2 in MoC (Fig. 3d) [33,34]. Besides, the peaks at 231 and 234.4 eV can be attributed to Mo5+ 3d5/2 and Mo5+ 3d3/2, while 232.7 and 235.7 eV belong to Mo6+ 3d5/2 and Mo6+ 3d3/2.The binding energy at 283.9 eV can be attributed to C-Mo of MoC; 286.41 and 289.3 eV are in accordance with the C─O and O─CO. As shown in Fig. 3e, it is obvious that the O1s spectrum in FeCoNiMo-M can be fitted with three peaks corresponding to M─OOH (≈533.3 eV), M─OH (≈531.58 eV), and M─O (≈530.1 eV). Compared to FeCoNiMo-H, the binding energy has increased by 0.3 eV, which may be attributed to the interaction of MoC with electrons. The presence of M-O also indicates the existence of a small amount of metal oxides in both samples, which is consistent with the XRD results. As shown in Fig. 3f, the EPR spectra of both samples show a g value of 2.003, attributed to OV, indicating the presence of OV defects in both catalysts. The microwave-assisted rapid high-temperature process will increase the ratio of Mo5+/Mo6+, and as the content of Mo5+ increases, the concentration of oxygen vacancies (OV) also increases [35]. The peak of the EPR characteristic is positively correlated with the number of oxygen vacancies (OV), indicating that the oxygen vacancy (OV) amount is significantly higher in the heterostructure catalyst prepared by the microwave method [36]. The increased oxygen vacancies (OV) produce more reactive sites as well as alter the electronic structure of Mo atoms (Mo5+/Mo6+), thereby enhancing the intrinsic OER activity [37,38]. 3.2 Electrochemical performances of FeCoNiMo-M catalyst for OER The electrocatalytic OER activity of FeCoNiMo-M and FeCoNiMo-H catalysts was investigated by an oxygen-saturated 1 M KOH solution using three electrode equipment at ambient temperature. As shown in the polarization curve in Fig. 4a, compared with the FeCoNiMo-H (250 mV), the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst exhibits a lower overpotential of 232 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Particularly, the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst has achieved an extraordinary overpotential of 290 mV with a current density of 100 mA cm−2, outperforming most HEA catalysts. The polarization curve without IR correction is shown in Fig. S7. Fig. 4b shows that the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst tafel slope (61.47 mV dec−1) is less than the FeCoNiMo-H (86.25 mV dec−1)., which indicates faster kinetics for the OER of the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst. And simultaneously, Fig. 4c and S8 demonstrate that there is a positive correlation between the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the electrocatalysts and their electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl). The calculated Cdl size of the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst is approximately 3.86 mF cm−2, twice that of the FeCoNiMo-H catalyst (1.72 mF cm−2). Surprisingly, at an overpotential of 300 mV, the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst exhibits a higher turnover frequency (TOF) value of approximately 0.031 s−1, higher than that of the FeCoNiMo-H catalyst (0.021 s−1) in Fig. 4e. During the catalytic OER process, further elucidation of the reaction kinetics of the two HEA catalysts will be based on the data obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The Nyquist plots fitted by equivalent circuit diagrams show that under a high overpotential of 300 mV in 1.0 M KOH, Fig. 4d demonstrates that the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst has the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct) of approximately 0.93 Ω. This value is significantly smaller than that of the FeCoNiMo-H catalyst (1.63 Ω). The kinetic barriers for OER of FeCoNiMo-M, FeCoNiMo-H, and NF were established using the Arrhenius equation. Based on temperature-dependent polarization curves and derived Arrhenius plots (Fig. S9), the barrier for FeCoNiMo-M can be calculated as 21.33 kJ·mol−1, significantly lower than the barriers for FeCoNiMo-H (26.16 kJ·mol−1), indicating that FeCoNiMo-M has more favorable OER kinetics (Fig. S9). These results indicate that the FeCoNiMo-M heterogeneous catalyst prepared by the microwave method has a faster OER response, which may be attributed to the dual-phase interface between MoC and high-entropy alloy improving its electronic structure. Moreover, the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst outperformed numerous OER HEA catalysts under similar circumstances (Fig. 4f, Table S2). 3.3 Catalytic stability of FeCoNiMo-M catalyst during OER In order to assess the electrocatalytic stability of the FeCoNiMo-M and FeCoNiMo-H catalysts, three-electrode equipment was used to conduct the stability tests in an oxygen-saturated 1 M KOH solution at ambient temperature. The electrocatalytic stability of FeCoNiMo-M and FeCoNiMo-H catalysts was assessed in an oxygen -saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte using three-electrode equipment at ambient temperature. After a 240-hour OER stability test at 100 mA cm−2, the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst demonstrated remarkable durability with minimal activity decay. In contrast, the potential of the FeCoNiMo-H HEA increased by 22 mV after the same test period (Fig. 4g). Furthermore, it shows no discernible distinction in OER performance of the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst before and after the 240-hour stability test with a high current density of 100 mA cm−2 from Fig. S10a and b. In contrast, the FeCoNiMo-H sample exhibits a significant decrease in OER performance after stability testing, as shown in Fig. S10c and d. These findings suggest that the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst demonstrates significantly superior OER catalytic stability. In addition, we conducted stability tests on the synthesized FeCoNiMo-M catalyst under industrial conditions, and it showed a low potential of about 2.2 V at a current density of 500 mA cm−2 and stability for up to 84 hours (Fig. S11). SEM and XPS were used to analyze the morphology and elemental electronic structure of FeCoNiMo-M and FeCoNiMo-H catalysts after stability testing. Both samples underwent some changes after stability testing. These changes in morphology and surface chemical state are crucial factors that largely control the excellent stability of the electrocatalysts, particularly the structural reconstruction occurring on the catalyst surface, which may be the main factor affecting their performance and stability. Fig. S12 reveals that, after the stability test, the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst retains its nanoparticle morphology, unlike the FeCoNiMo-H catalyst. It is evident that there is obvious oxide formation on the surface edge of the FeCoNiMo-M sample after 240 h of stability testing, while the rest of the sample maintains the original catalyst morphology well. This further demonstrates that the MoC on the surface of the FeCoNiMo-M heterogeneous catalyst may protect its internal active centers. Compared to the FeCoNiMo-H sample, the FeCoNiMo-M sample still has a higher amount of catalyst attached to the substrate surface after 240 h of stability testing. The XPS spectra of Fe 2p, Co 2p, Ni 2p, and Mo 3d of the two samples are placed in Fig. 5 and Fig. S13. The peak at 709.72 eV corresponds to Fe0 2p3/2, while the peak at 723.7 eV is attributed to Fe0 2p1/2. Similarly, the peak observed at 712.47 eV belongs to Fe2+ 2p3/2, and the peak at 725.35 eV belongs to Fe0 2p1/2. The Fe, Co, and Ni elements of FeCoNiMo-M also show that the original zero valence state of the alloy was retained. In particular, after 240 h of OER testing, no Mo0 species were detected. The peaks at 233.4 and 234.1 eV can be attributed to Mo4+ in MoC, and there is a significant positive shift in the binding energies of Mo5+and Mo6+ (Fig. 5e), which indicates a significant oxidation occurred in Mo species. This is also consistent with SEM results, showing a clear distribution of C and Mo elements at the edge oxide of the catalyst (Fig. S13). After durability testing, XPS O 1 s spectra of the two catalysts showed three peaks (Fig. 5e). The peak at 530.1 eV corresponds to M-O, while the peaks at 531.55 eV and 533.25 eV represent M─OH and M─OOH, respectively. After 240 h of stability testing, the proportion of M─O increased in both samples, indicating the formation of oxide species on their surfaces. The superior performance and stability of the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst can be attributed to the abundance of oxygen vacancies, as our previous analysis has shown. The presence of MoC phase on the surface of the FeCoNiMo-M hetero-catalyst may be crucial for maintaining its abundant oxygen vacancies. It was found that after 240 h of stability testing, the surface of the FeCoNiMo-M sample formed some oxide, but at the same time, the original structure and morphology of the catalyst were also well protected. These oxides may belong to surface-oxidized carbon nanotubes and the oxidation of MoC. The outer wall of carbon nanotubes is responsible for the OER reaction, while the inner wall enhances the electron transfer rate (Tunneling effect). The activity and stability of the OER reaction can be enhanced by these carbon nanotubes that have undergone surface oxidation [39]. And the oxidation of MoC also protects the active center of the metal. Fig. 6a and d illustrate the results of a methanol probe experiment conducted to measure the adsorption capacity of the OER midbody OH*. Compared to the FeCoNiMo-H sample, the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst exhibits a high MOR current, indicating a high surface coverage of OH*, which indicates that the MoC in the FeCoNiMo-M heterogeneous catalyst enhances the adsorption capability of the OH* midbody [40]. Additionally, the high concentration of OH* species on the surface of the FeCoNiMo-M sample can expedite OER as a forebody for the conversion of O(II-δ) - active species [41]. To further support the results and clarify the different performance between the catalysts prepared by the two methods, in situ Raman analysis was performed during OER analysis. The Raman spectra of FeCoNiMo-M are considerably different from those of the FeCoNiMo-H sample. Neither of the original samples showed significant Raman signature peaks, demonstrating the successful synthesis of high-entropy alloy/MoC heterostructure and HEA structure. Importantly, when a voltage of 1.1 V is applied, the FeCoNiMo-M sample shows two well-defined peaks at 470 and 542 cm−1. The bending vibration mode and stretching vibration mode of NiIII-O in NiOOH (Fig. 6b) are attributed to the Eg and A1 g modes [42]. However, the FeCoNiMo-H sample only exhibits these two characteristic peaks when a voltage of 1.4 V is applied (Fig. 6e). This indicates that the conversion of the FeCoNiMo-M sample to MOOH, the real intermediate active substance of the OER reaction, will occur at a low overpotential to accelerate the subsequent reaction, which is the main reason for its superior OER performance. The structural transformation under low overpotential may be due to the unique heterostructure structure caused by the microwave method. This is mainly because the MoC in the FeCoNiMo-M heterostructure not only accelerates the conversion to intermediate O (II-δ) -, thereby speeding up the transformation to the actual intermediate NiOOH, but also protects Ni as the actual active site from oxidation[43,44]. The results of the methanol probe experiment are consistent with this finding: the MoC in the FeCoNiMo-M heterostructure catalyst enhances the adsorption of OH* and accelerates its conversion to O (II-δ) - active sites, thereby speeding up the subsequent transformation to NiOOH intermediates. This is also the main reason for the superior performance of the FeCoNiMo-M. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have presented a high-efficiency high-entropy alloy/MoC (FeCoNiMo-M) heterostructure electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The prepared catalyst requires only 232 mV of overpotential (at 10 mA cm−2), exhibiting excellent durability surpassing that of FeCoNiMo-H and the most reported high-entropy alloy catalysts. XPS analysis shows that, compared to the FeCoNiMo-H catalyst, the high entropy alloy/MoC heterogeneous catalyst prepared by the microwave method significantly increases the amount of oxygen vacancies (OV). These increased oxygen vacancies (OV) generate more reaction sites and alter the electronic structure of Mo atoms (Mo5+/Mo6+), thereby enhancing the OER activity. Methanol probe experiments and in-situ Raman analysis provide further insights. They demonstrate that the MoC in the FeCoNiMo-M heterostructure catalyst enhances the adsorption of OH* and accelerates its conversion to O (II-δ) - active sites, thereby speeding up the subsequent transformation into NiOOH intermediates. Additionally, MoC protects the active sites (Ni) of the metal center from oxidation. CRediT authorship contribution statement Qianglong Qi: Validation. Yue Zhang: Software.

        "dc:description": "Due to the expensive cost of precious metals, there is an urgent need to develop cheap and efficient catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a novel catalyst, high-entropy alloy (HEA) has found widespread application in the field of hydrogen production through water electrolysis. However, a significant portion of HEA catalysts prepared by traditional solvothermal methods are challenging due to their high cost, extended compound cycle, and relatively difficult electronic structure adjustment in the catalytic center. In this study, a heterostructure catalyst composed of MoC and FeCoNiMo HEA alloy (denoted as FeCoNiMo-M) was synthesized by the microwave method. Catalysts produced via the microwave method typically exhibit MoC encloses the spherical heterostructure of the internal high entropy alloy, MoC not only protects the true active center NiOOH, but even further regulates the electronic structure of the catalyst. Notably, the FeCoNiMo-M sample synthesized using microwave demonstrates an overpotential of merely 232 mV (@10 mA cm−2) in 1 M KOH, nearly 20 mV lower compared to the traditional hydrothermally-synthesized FeCoNiMo-H HEA catalyst. Furthermore, the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst demonstrates impressive durability in OER with a significant current density of 100 mA cm−2 for a duration of 240 hours. The in-situ Raman results indicate that the FeCoNiMo-M catalyst undergoes the conversion of the actual reaction intermediate NiOOH and accelerates the OER with only a very low overpotential. These findings suggest that our approach could open up possibilities for the advancement of OER catalysts that are both more convenient and efficient.",
