Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted attention in the research of CO₂RR due to their distinct atomic structure and performance features. However, their inherent shortcomings, such as limited stability and low charge transfer efficiency, also limit their further progress. In this study, a novel Fe-Ni diatomic catalyst (Fe2/Ni1-N-C) anchored on a three-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon framework was successfully synthesized, demonstrating remarkable electrochemical activity and selectivity for converting CO2 to CO. The Fe2/Ni1-N-C catalyst achieved a high Faraday efficiency (FECO) of 96 % when operated at -0.76 V (vs. RHE) and it maintained stable performance over 20 h of continuous operation. The experimental results show that maintaining the stability of the coordination environment at the atomic level of the catalyst plays an important role in its activity, selectivity and stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the successful construction of adjacent Fe-Ni active sites, with atomic dispersion of NiN4 and FeN4. The synergistic effect between the bimetals was found to play a critical role in promoting the formation of *COOH intermediates and facilitating the desorption of *CO, thereby enhancing both CO selectivity and catalytic activity. This study provides valuable insights into the design of efficient diatomic catalysts for CO2 electroreduction.

In response to this urgent environmental challenge, there is a growing interest in developing sustainable and efficient methods of CO2 utilization and conversion [4–6]. Among the various strategies, electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) has emerged as a promising approach because of its potential to convert CO2 into value-added chemicals such as methanol [7], formic acid[8], and ethylene[9], and fuels like methane [10], using renewable electricity. However, it is crucial to note that reacting at lower overpotentials and with high selectivity is required to achieve high energy efficiency and scalability [11]. Electrochemically converting CO2 into CO offers significant benefits over alternative routes, such as its simpler reaction mechanism and the possibility of obtaining high selectivity [12]. These enhancements can be credited to the minimal overpotential and the decreased energy barrier required for the process [13,14]. Furthermore, CO plays an essential role as a raw material in the production of other chemical compounds [15]. The potential of several electrocatalysts has been explored to promote the process of electrochemically reducing carbon dioxide to CO [16]. For instance, the Faraday efficiency of CO generation has been shown to exceed 90 % when using Au and Ag catalysts [17,18]. Owing to the rarity and high cost of precious metals, there is a vital need to uncover economical catalysts that can be produced in significant amounts. Consequently, the rational design of non-precious metal catalysts has become the primary objective in order to enhance the high selectivity, high chemical activity and high stability of CO. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are materials that are characterized by a porous structure which is mainly composed of metal ions or clusters that are connected by organic non-metallic ligands [19]. Recently, MOF-derived nitrogen-doped carbon materials have attracted considerable interest, principally due to their high surface area and adjustable pore structure, rendering them highly suitable for diverse energy conversion and storage applications like fuel cells [20] and supercapacitors [21]. The effectiveness of single-atom catalysts (SACs) in the electroreduction of CO₂ has been confirmed when these catalysts are supported by a MOF [22,23]. The effectiveness of these catalysts can be attributed to maximized atomic utilization efficiency, distinct electronic structure and highly homogeneous active site [24–26]. However, the utilization of SACs is limited by low charge transfer efficiency and limited stability, which greatly affects the catalytic efficiency and practical application. The utilization of diatomic central catalysts (DASCs) constitutes a novel approach to achieving the effective transformation of CO2RR, a phenomenon attributable to the synergistic effect between diatoms [27–29]. The synergistic effect between two-centre atoms introduces a novel regulatory dimension to CO2RR. The ability of two atoms to adsorb and activate CO2 molecules and reaction intermediates in different forms, optimize the reaction energy barrier and significantly improve catalytic activity, is of particular significance [30,31]. However, it is still challenging to ensure the stable positioning of two atoms on a carrier with precise spacing and coordination conditions, and to showcase their effectiveness as a selective diatomic structure in CO₂ reduction reactions. In this study, a novel Fe-Ni diatomic catalyst (Fe2/Ni1-N-C) was constructed, which was anchored on a three-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon framework. This catalyst exhibited electrochemical activity and selectivity for converting CO₂ to CO. The Fe₂/Ni₁-N-C catalyst demonstrated a Faraday efficiency for CO production (FECO) of 96 % when operated at -0.76 V (relative to RHE), and it remained stable during 20 h of uninterrupted use. This catalyst benefited from its innovative synthesis technique, which provided it with exceptional catalytic active sites and enhanced interaction between Fe and Ni metals. Research shows that a stable coordination environment is beneficial for sustaining the overall stability of the catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation provided strong confirmation that the atomic dispersion of NiN₄ and FeN₄ effectively created neighboring Fe-Ni active sites. The synergistic relationship between the metals has been shown to boost the formation of *COOH and the desorption process of *CO, thus achieving superior CO selectivity and activity. These results suggest great potential for the application of such catalysts in more efficient and sustainable CO2 conversion processes in the future. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Structural and morphological analysis The synthesis of the Fe2/Ni1-N-C dual-site atomic catalyst involved the use of ion-exchange and subsequent pyrolysis processes, detailed in Fig. 1 a (for additional experimental information, see Supporting Information). The preparation of ZIF-8 commenced with a co-precipitation process, which subsequently functioned as the carrier for the dual atomic species. The transmission electron microscopy image (TEM, Fig. 1b) is shown as a hexagonal shape with the side size controlled around 200 nm. The specific shape and size of the ZIF-8 carrier could potentially affect its surface area and reactivity. As shown in the TEM image (Fig. S1), the Ni-Fe doped ZnO quantum dots were successfully produced through the co-precipitation process, highlighting a uniform incorporation of Ni and Fe into the ZnO lattice. The Ni-Fe doped ZnO quantum dots were then grown on ZIF-8 carriers by ion-exchange method, with the TEM image (Fig. 1c) showing the successful growth on ZIF-8 carriers. In addition, a lattice stripe approximately of about 0.253 nm was observed, corresponding to the (102) face of ZnO (Fig. 1d). HRTEM images confirmed the presence of Ni-Fe doped ZnO quantum dots. The final Fe2/Ni1-N-C was obtained following carbonization under nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. 1e and Fig. 1f). The SEM images (Fig. S2) taken after the carbonization step indicated that the Fe2/Ni1-N-C sample had a limited amount of wrinkling. Such textural features are believed to be the result of localized stress induced by lattice imperfections (attributable to nitrogen and iron doping) as well as the expansion effects from multiple gases [32]. The overall ZIF-8 carrier framework did not collapse after carbonization. The larger volume and specific surface area of the carrier are more favorable for providing abundant catalytic active sites. Direct observation of atomically dispersed Fe-Ni atoms was achieved through the use of spherical aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 1g), with the presence of multiple paired bright spots indicating Fe-Ni-Nx arrangements. Furthermore, elemental distribution maps showed a uniform distribution of Fe, Ni, N and C in Fe2/Ni1-N-C (Fig. 1h and 1i). Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-OES) was utilized to ascertain the precise metal composition of Fe2/Ni1-N-C, where in Fe and Ni were found to be 0.55 wt. % and 0.2 wt. %, respectively. The observed Fe and Ni ratios were found to be congruent with the actual feed ratios, with the actual feed ratios, with both being 2. Therefore, it was established that atomically dispersed Fe/Ni-Nx sites existed within Fe2/Ni1-N-C. For the characterization of the crystalline phases in all samples, XRD was used (Fig. 2 a and b). The XRD spectra of Fe-ZnO, Ni-ZnO, and Fe2/Ni1-ZnO were loaded onto ZIF-8 remained unchanged when compared to the ZIF-8 carrier (Fig. 2a), thereby indicating that the loading of M-ZnO quantum dots did not result in any alteration to the crystalline phase of ZIF-8. The peak height decreased at 7.5° and 13°, indicating a reduction in the degree of crystallization decreases with the incorporation of Fe2/Ni1-ZnO. This points towards either the lack of formation of large metal nanoparticles during synthesis or an extremely small particle size, both contributing to improved CO2RR activity. The indeterminate carbon materials were obtained after calcination at 900°C in a nitrogen atmosphere. Fig. 2b shows that the XRD patterns of all catalysts displayed two significant peaks at 24° and 44°, relating to the (002) and (004) crystal planes of graphitic carbon, respectively. No additional characteristic peaks detected, suggesting that the metal nanoparticles in the three prepared catalysts became dispersed in an atomic state with the carbon skeleton. As shown in Fig. S3, the zeta potentials of ZIF-8, Fe-ZnO, Ni-ZnO, and Fe2/Ni1-ZnO are all positive, with the zeta potential of Fe/Ni-ZnO intermediate between that of Fe-ZnO and Ni-ZnO, and it is not a simple additive sum to take the mean value, indicating that there is an interaction between Fe and Ni on ZnO. The degree of graphitization of Fe2/Ni1-N-C, Fe-N-C, Ni-N-C and N-C was obtained by Raman spectral fitting analysis as shown in Fig. 2c. The disordered carbon with lattice defects (D-band) and ordered carbon with graphitic phase (G-band) of the carbon materials correspond to the positions at 1330 cm-1 and 1590 cm-1 in the Raman spectra, respectively. The extent of graphitization in carbon materials can be indicated by the directly proportional ID/IG ratio, which compares the intensities of the D-band and G-band. Compared to Ni-N-C (1.53), Fe-N-C (1.57), and N-C (1.71), the ID/IG value for Fe2/Ni1-N-C is notably lower at 1.45. This indicates that Fe2/Ni1-N-C exhibits a higher degree of graphitization or fewer defects compared to the other materials mentioned. Graphitic carbon facilitates the acceleration of the electron transfer, thereby improving improves the electrocatalytic activity and protecting the electrode from corrosion at the same time. Recent research has demonstrated that transition metal ions are capable of binding with nitrogen atoms, especially pyridinic nitrogen, during the thermal carbonization process involving transition metals, nitrogen, and carbon sources, resulting in M-N complexes [33,34]. These complexes have been suggested to determine the catalytic species in CO2RR [33]. Furthermore, the bond formed between metal and nitrogen atoms leads to the establishment of M-N species, affecting the electronic surroundings of nitrogen atoms differently from those in materials doped with nitrogen but devoid of metals. Such variations are directly observable by examining the N1s peak using XPS, serving as a benchmark to validate the creation of M-N complexes [35,36]. Consequently, a high-resolution N1s XPS analysis of M-N-C was conducted to confirm the formation of M-N complexes (Fig. 2d). The data in Table S1 reveals that the relative quantities of five nitrogen configurations in diverse metal-doped catalysts were derived from the analysis of integrated peak areas. Notably, the proportions of pyridine nitrogen, M-N, and pyrrole nitrogen were much greater compared to nitrogen oxide, suggesting that these species favor CO2RR, especially with a balanced presence of M-N being particularly beneficial. It is also notable that the M-N content of Fe2/Ni1-N-C was significantly higher than that of Fe-N-C and Ni-N-C. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Fe 2p showed peaks attributed to the Fe-N conformation at about 710.2 eV, while the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni 2p showed peaks belonging to the Ni-N conformation at about 853.8 eV (Fig. 2e), which suggests that all Fe and Ni species are present in a homogeneous state in the Fe2/Ni1-N-C catalyst all Fe and Ni species exist in a homogeneous state. Notably, the Fe 2p binding energy of Fe2/Ni1-N-C exhibits a negative shift, whereas the Ni 2p binding energy shows a positive shift, when compared to their respective single-metal counterparts (Fe-N-C and Ni-N-C). This indicates electron transfer from Ni to Fe in Fe2/Ni1-N-C, leading to stronger electronic interactions between adjacent Ni and Fe atoms [37,38]. The specific surface area and pore size of Fe-N-C, Ni-N-C, and Fe2/Ni1-N-C catalysts were further analyzed through BET analysis. To calculate the pore size distribution, non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) models were utilized. The Fig. 3 a shows three catalysts displaying type IV isothermal curves. Fig. 3b shows the pore size distribution of the series of materials mainly around 20 nm, indicating a predominantly mesoporous nature. Fig. 3c and 3d show that Fe-N-C has a specific surface area of 395.4 m²/g and an average pore diameter of 12.7 nm. Ni-N-C exhibits a higher specific surface area of 484.5 m²/g and a smaller average pore size of 8.8 nm. Fe2/Ni1-N-C has a specific surface area of 406.1 m²/g and an average pore size of 11.3 nm. These results suggest that Fe promotes larger pore sizes, while Ni enhances the specific surface area. With a higher specific surface area and an optimal pore size, Fe2/Ni1-N-C offers superior reaction sites and enhanced CO2 diffusion over Fe-N-C and Ni-N-C. The interaction of Fe and Ni in Fe2/Ni1-N-C will enhance CO2 adsorption and electrochemical CO2RR. 2.2 Electrochemical performance evaluation All catalysts were tested at room temperature in a three-electrode H-type electrolytic cell with an electrolyte of 0.5 M KHCO3. GC was used to detect the gas-phase products, FID to detect CO, and TCD to detect H2. CO2 was continuously passed to the cathode of the H-type electrolytic cell during the reaction. As shown in Fig. 4 a and Fig. 4b, the current densities observed for Fe2/Ni1-N-C are greater compared to Fe-N-C and markedly higher compared to Ni-N-C, suggesting that the presence of bimetallic metals enhances CO2 activation capabilities and that Fe2/Ni1-N-C exhibits a better onset potential. As shown in Fig. 4c, Fe2/Ni1-N-C has the highest CO selectivity, and the Faraday efficiency of carbon monoxide (FECO) can reach 96 % at -0.77 V (vs. RHE). Moreover, the Fe2/Ni1-N-C shown in Fig. 4d has the lowest H2 selectivity with a Faraday efficiency (FEH2) of 4 % for hydrogen at -0.77 V (vs. RHE). The CO2RR activity and selectivity of Fe2/Ni1-N-C is superior to that of Ni-N-C and Fe-N-C, which suggests that Fe2/Ni1-N-C has a great advantage. The synergistic effect between neighbouring Ni and Fe atoms, which helps to accelerate the CO2RR reaction, was further highlighted. Additionally, the CV curves and their respective electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl) values are shown in Fig. S4, demonstrating a direct relationship between Cdl and the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). The higher Cdl value of 41.9 mF/cm² observed for Fe2/Ni1-N-C, compared to other electrodes, suggests that this material exposes a larger number of active sites, contributing to its enhanced electrocatalytic activity. While investigating the role of various metals in CO2RR electrochemical activity and selectivity, we also looked into how different metal ratios influence these properties. As shown in Fig. S5a and Fig. S5b, the other proportions of catalysts exhibited similar current densities while Fe2/Ni1-N-C exhibited the highest current density. As shown in Fig. S5c and Fig. S5d, Fe2/Ni1-N-C not only shows superior CO selectivity but also the minimal H2 selectivity among the tested materials. Fig. S6 shows that other proportions of catalysts exhibited similar ECSA while Fe2/Ni1-N-C had much higher Cdl values than other proportions of metal electrodes. It indicates that Fe2/Ni1-N-C has the most catalytically active sites, which are conducive to enhancing CO2 adsorption and providing the catalytic activity of CO2RR. For a better understanding of the Fe2/Ni1-N-C catalyst's superior performance, we benchmarked it against formerly reported effective electrocatalysts (Table S2), revealing its excellent CO selectivity. Finally, we evaluated the stability of Fe2/Ni1-N-C by i-t test. Fig. 4e shows that the performance stability of Fe2/Ni1-N-C can be maintained for 20 h during continuous catalysis with little fluctuation in FECO. The TEM image in Fig. S7 shows that the carrier structure was not damaged during the prolonged testing and still maintains this better structure. The HAADF-STEM image in Fig. S8 confirms that the diatomic pair of Fe2/Ni1-N-C is well retained after the stability test and that the diatomic sites do not undergo large-scale agglomeration. To further investigate the correlation between properties and structure, we performed structural characterization post-stability testing. Fig. S9 shows that the XRD patterns of the catalysts were unaltered after long cycling tests. Moreover, Fig. S10 indicates that the metal center retained its original valence state during extended reduction, ensuring its electronic structure remained intact and maintained effective CO₂ activation. 2.3 Analyzing catalytic mechanisms by DFT calculations Research findings highlight that the structure of bimetallic-nitrogen sites is essential for enhancing both the activity and the selectivity of catalysts used in CO2RR [39,40]. In this study, we explored the possible synergistic effects of bimetallic-nitrogen site configurations on CO2RR through first-principles DFT calculations, providing deeper insights into the exceptional catalytic performance observed experimentally with the optimal Fe-Ni bimetallic site catalysts (Fig. 5 ). We investigated three Fe-Ni atomic site configurations with different nitrogen coordination environments and structures (Fig. 5). Theoretical calculations show that there is a significant difference in the spacing of the Fe-Ni atoms for the three configurations: 2.42 Å for the 2N-bridged structure (Fig. 5a), 2.47 Å for the non-bridged structure (Fig. 5b), and 3.55 Å for the 1N-bridged structure (Fig. 5c). By comparing the experimental observations with the AC-STEM results (Fig. 1g), we find that the 1N-bridged N7 site configuration (Model III) is more consistent with the measured intermetallic distances. features are more compatible. This configuration with larger interatomic spacing may result from the site-blocking effect of the single-bridged structure on the metal centre, and also provides a unique geometrical environment for the construction of catalytically active sites. In general, two electrons participate in the reduction of CO2 to CO, where the CO2 to *COOH process plays a decisive role [41,42]. As shown in the Gibbs free energy spectrum in Fig. 5d, the free - energy change for the formation of *COOH at Fe sites in Fe2/Ni1-N-C is approximately 0.5 eV lower than that at metal sites in other catalysts. The above results clearly demonstrate that the adjacent Ni-N₄ sites greatly enhance the CO₂RR performance of the Fe sites. The DFT calculations further elucidated that the enhanced catalyst performance stems from the synergistic interaction between these two metal sites, which is able to kinetically promote *COOH adsorption and *CO desorption while inhibiting HER. Comparative studies reveal that bimetallic Ni-Fe systems demonstrate superior catalytic performance over their single-metal counterparts (Ni or Fe). These Ni-Fe dual-metal catalysts achieve optimal reaction activity, exceptional CO production efficiency, and enhanced long-term stability, positioning them as highly promising candidates for advanced catalytic applications. 3 Conclusions In this work, we propose a secondary dispersion metal loading method for preparing bimetallic site catalysts (Fe2/Ni1-N-C) for use in the CO₂ electroreduction reaction (CO₂RR) to produce CO. Compared to monometallic catalysts, Fe₂/Ni₁-N-C shows enhanced catalytic performance and selectivity in the CO₂ reduction reaction. Furthermore, The Fe₂/Ni₁-N-C catalyst shows outstanding selectivity and stability during CO₂RR in the voltage window of -1.2 to -0.4 V (vs. RHE), reaching a peak FECO of 96 % at -0.76 V (vs. RHE) with continuous operation for 20 hours. According to experimental result and DFT computations, the atomic dispersion of NiN₄ and FeN₄ facilitates the formation of adjacent Fe-Ni active sites, where the cooperative interaction between Fe and Ni modifies the surface charge and optimizes the binding energies of intermediates. Consequently, the atomic-level coordination environment is vital in retarding degradation, which is essential for advancing efficient and long-lasting CO₂ conversion technologies.

        "dc:description": "Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted attention in the research of CO₂RR due to their distinct atomic structure and performance features. However, their inherent shortcomings, such as limited stability and low charge transfer efficiency, also limit their further progress. In this study, a novel Fe-Ni diatomic catalyst (Fe2/Ni1-N-C) anchored on a three-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon framework was successfully synthesized, demonstrating remarkable electrochemical activity and selectivity for converting CO2 to CO. The Fe2/Ni1-N-C catalyst achieved a high Faraday efficiency (FECO) of 96 % when operated at -0.76 V (vs. RHE) and it maintained stable performance over 20 h of continuous operation. The experimental results show that maintaining the stability of the coordination environment at the atomic level of the catalyst plays an important role in its activity, selectivity and stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the successful construction of adjacent Fe-Ni active sites, with atomic dispersion of NiN4 and FeN4. The synergistic effect between the bimetals was found to play a critical role in promoting the formation of *COOH intermediates and facilitating the desorption of *CO, thereby enhancing both CO selectivity and catalytic activity. This study provides valuable insights into the design of efficient diatomic catalysts for CO2 electroreduction.",
