Fig. 1 STEM images of the 1 %Pd/CeO2 10 nm, 1 %Pd/CeO2 25 nm and 1 %Pd/CeO2 100 nm samples. Fig. 2 CO-DRIFTS obtained using (a) the 1 % Pd/CeO2 catalysts characterized by 10 nm (purple), 25 nm (light blue) and 100 nm (blue) ceria nanoparticles and (b) bare ceria supports characterized by 10 nm (black) and 100 nm (red) nanoparticles. The catalysts and the supports were treated in 1 % O2 at 400 °C for 30 min, followed by an Ar purge at 300 °C and 5 % H2 for 30 min at 300 °C. The catalysts and the supports were then exposed to 5000 ppm CO/Ar at 35 °C. The spectra correspond to the last spectrum obtained during CO exposure, after reaching saturation for each sample. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Fig. 3 DRIFTS spectra obtained during the CO2-CO adsorption experiment using the 1 % Pd/CeO2 25 nm sample. The catalyst was treated in 1 % O2 for 30 min at 400 °C, purged in Ar and reduced in 5 % H2 for 30 min at 300 °C. The temperature was reduced to 35 °C in Ar and an initial background of the reduced catalyst was taken. The catalyst was exposed to 1 % CO2 at 35 °C until saturation. This was followed by purging in Ar until carbonate decomposition/desorption stopped, then a new background of the catalyst containing the remaining carbonates was taken. Finally a new background of the sample containing carbonates was obtained and the sample was then exposed to 5000 ppm CO at 35 °C. The legend indicates the gas environment in which the catalyst was exposed during spectrum acquisition. Fig. 4 Comparison between the dispersion measurements obtained via CO and CO2-CO chemisorption on 1 % Pd/CeO2-10, 25 and 100 nm, 0.2 % Pd/CeO2-1 µm, 0.8 % Pd/CeO2-1 µm, 1.2 % Pd/CeO2-1 µm and fresh 1.2 % Pd/Al2O3. Fig. 5 CO oxidation (a) conversion profiles and (b) Arrhenius plot on 1 %Pd/CeO2 − 10, 25 and 100 nm. The catalysts were pre-reduced at 300 °C in 5 % H2 for 30 min. The catalysts were exposed to 5000 ppm CO and 2500 ppm O2, balanced in N2. The rates were taken at steady-state. The rates were normalized by Pd perimeter sites. Fig. 6 CO oxidation Arrhenius plot on 1.2 %Pd/Al2O3 aged at 650, 750 and 850 °C. The catalysts were pre-reduced in 5 % H2 for 30 min at 400 °C. The catalysts were exposed to CO = 5000 ppm, O2 = 2500 ppm, H2O = 6 % balanced in N2. The rates were taken at steady-state. The rates were normalized by Pd surface sites measured via CO2-CO chemisorption. Table 1 Ceria particle sizes obtained using the Scherrer equation.

Graphical abstract Characterizing ceria-containing catalysts via common characterization techniques can be challenging. CO chemisorption is usually used to measure catalyst dispersion. However, the reaction between CO and ceria lattice oxygen leads to significant carbonate formation, resulting in an overestimation of the CO uptake and metal dispersion. Here, we propose a modified method to characterize ceria-containing catalysts which involves exposing the catalyst to CO2 prior CO adsorption to prevent further carbonate formation during CO chemisorption. We tested this method on Pd/CeO2 catalysts characterized by different ceria particle sizes and validated it via DRIFTS and CO oxidation kinetics. Validation conducted using CO oxidation kinetics showed that the TOFs derived by normalizing the reaction rates by the interfacial sites, which are the active sites, are similar for all the catalysts under investigation. Our results show that CO2-CO chemisorption can be a reliable technique for estimating metal dispersion of ceria-supported catalysts.

By definition, TOF is defined as the moles of product formed per active site per unit time. For metal supported catalysts, TOF is determined as the reaction rate normalized by the number of active sites, which are assumed to be the number of exposed metal atoms [1–3]. Therefore, determination of the active metal surface area is key to quantifying a reaction rate via TOF and studying fundamental catalytic properties of metal supported catalysts. Several methods are often used to calculate the number of active sites and common techniques include chemisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). However, for some catalysts, these traditional techniques present challenges. For example, in the case of Pd/CeO2 catalysts, the use of TEM can be difficult because of the poor Z contrast between ceria and Pd [4]. Cerium is a heavier element than Pd; therefore, Pd particles are indistinguishable in images because they are obscured by the support. X-ray diffraction (XRD) can be used to estimate the metal crystallite size characterized by particles on average larger than 3 nm [5,6]. However, with smaller metal particle size, there is less crystallinity leading to weak, or no, diffraction patterns and metal peak changes could be difficult to discern in the ceria scattering pattern [5]. Another commonly employed method for determining metal catalyst active surface area is chemisorption of probe molecules such as CO or H2 [7]. However, again, the accuracy of such measurements performed on Pd/CeO2 catalysts is compromised. H2 is known to be soluble in Pd nanoparticles at room temperature, leading to the formation of beta-phase palladium hydride [8,9]. The ability of H2 to diffuse into Pd bulk affects the H2 uptake during H2 chemisorption, leading to a higher than actual dispersion measurement. This phenomenon does depend on Pd particle size, with increasing H2 solubility with increasing Pd nanoparticle size [9,10]. The formation of beta-phase PdH can be overcome by performing the analysis at 100 °C, which is above PdH decomposition temperature. Yet, on ceria supported Pd catalysts, exposure to H2 at higher temperature leads to a reaction between H2 and the mobile lattice oxygen of ceria, again leading to a dispersion measurement higher than the actual value [11–13]. CO chemisorption also results in an overestimation of the active surface area, often exceeding unity. This is attributed to the interaction between CO and the support via the formation of carbonates [14–16]. This phenomenon primarily involves the catalyst support; therefore, it remains consistent even when metals other than Pd are deposited onto the ceria. Challenges in measuring metal dispersion are not limited to Pd/CeO2 catalysts. Similar difficulties are encountered with other metals and supports. For example, structural changes occurring during probe molecule adsorption on metals can lead to inaccurate dispersion measurements. This has been reported for Rh- and Ir-supported catalysts. Upon CO adsorption at room temperature, Rh and Ir nanoparticles are redispersed into single atoms via the formation of gem-dicarbonyl species, which is characterized by two CO molecules per isolated metal single atom [17–22]. These structural changes lead to a change in the stoichiometric factor used to quantify dispersion, and of course the measurement itself changes the dispersion of the metal in comparison to that under reaction conditions. Since this process is size dependent, with smaller nanoparticles being more susceptible to particle disintegration into single atoms, the use of CO as a probe molecule for these metals introduces uncertainty in dispersion measurements. Also, phenomena such as H2 spillover have been observed with other catalysts characterized by oxygen storage material supports and can alter dispersion measurements [23–25]. Considering these complexities, the use of conventional techniques to measure exposed metal sites can become challenging. Identifying a technique able to measure ceria-supported catalyst dispersion is important given ceria’s widespread use in catalysis [26–29]. Ceria is well-known for its ability to store and release oxygen, which can play a role in enhancing reaction rates [15]. When combined with a noble metal, ceria can provide oxygen vacancy and defect sites that facilitate the activation of reactants and promote catalytic reactions [30]. Furthermore, strong-metal support interactions between the active metal and a reducible support can lead to higher catalytic activity [31]. This interaction also can promote metal nanoparticle dispersion, improve stability and enhance resistance to sintering [32]. Due to these properties, ceria is an excellent support material for various catalytic applications, such as gasoline engine aftertreatment systems [28,33,34], catalysts for H2 production [35–37], oxidation reactions [36,37],and CO2 hydrogenation [38] as just a few examples. Several metal dispersion characterization methods have been proposed for ceria supported catalysts that circumvent the challenges noted above; nonetheless, these are often less accessible or may still lead to complexities in correlating to reaction conditions. For example, colloidal synthesis offers the possibility of gaining deeper understanding of the catalytic properties of a material by precisely controlling the shape and size of catalyst nanoparticles. However, this advantage is counterbalanced by the use of surfactants that might negatively affect the catalytic activity unless carefully and fully removed [39]. And changes in particle size and morphology often occur during reaction, or during simulated or real aging protocols that lead to heterogeneous particle size distribution or morphology [22,40]. H2 or CO chemisorption at −78/81 °C has been proposed as a viable technique to count active sites [41,42]. At such low temperature, H (or CO) spillover, which normally occurs at ambient temperature and contributes to unrealistically high CO/H2 uptake, is hindered. However, the longer time required to attain this low temperature allows impurities, such as oxygen, to contaminate the sample and alter the oxidation state of the catalyst that exists in a reduced state [43]. Additionally, the use of structure insensitive reactions kinetics, such as alkene hydrogenation, is an option, even though in some cases it could require a longer time for an accurate analysis, or catalyst deactivation through coke formation occurs influencing available site measurements [44]. Also, the turnover frequency of a structure insensitive reaction at a specific temperature is needed to obtain the total number of exposed metal atoms. This requires the availability of a catalyst with a well-defined dispersion which allows that measure of TOF. Takeguchi at al. [14] previously proposed a CO pulse chemisorption method that allowed the determination of Pt dispersion on a Pt/CeO2 catalyst after a sequential pretreatment involving exposure to H2, O2, CO2 then H2 again. Through IR spectroscopy, the authors showed that the CO2 pre-adsorption step led to carbonate formation on ceria and during the subsequent CO pulse no further carbonate formation occurred. Without carbonate formation during the CO exposure, or bound CO formation on Pt during the prior CO2 exposure, only the metal sites were available for CO adsorption, leading to a reliable CO uptake. However, in the case of Pd-supported catalysts, the last H2 pretreatment step can be detrimental due to the formation of Pd hydrides, as previously mentioned. Here, we present a modified method proposed by Takeguchi for quantifying surface Pd at room temperature through static chemisorption, a technique that is more readily available. The modified method involves the exposure of the catalyst to CO2 before performing CO chemisorption, removing the intermediate H2 reduction. As previously shown, CO2 exposure causes the formation of carbonates on the support, leaving the metal site accessible for CO adsorption. This prevents the CO uptake from being influenced by carbonate formation. We evaluated the effectiveness of this technique across different ceria particle sizes as well as Pd/Al2O3 catalysts and confirmed its reliability through spectroscopic studies and CO oxidation kinetics. 2 Material and methods 2.1 Catalysts synthesis 1 wt% Pd/CeO2 catalysts with different CeO2 support particle sizes were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation. Pd(NO3)2 (10 wt% in 10 % HNO3 solution) purchased from Sigma Aldrich was used as a precursor. Different ceria supports were used in the synthesis process. CeO2 nanoparticles with advertised sizes of 10 and 100 nm were purchased from US Research Nanomaterials. A material with advertised 25 nm CeO2 nanoparticles was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. After Pd deposition, the catalysts were dried using a Thermo Scientific Lindberg muffle furnace at 120 °C for 4 h in static air. The temperature was then increased to 550 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min and held for 4 h. Separately, CeO2 with a nominal particle size of 1 µm was impregnated with Pd(NO3)2*2H2O, purchased from Sigma Aldrich to obtain 0.2, 0.8 and 1.2 wt% Pd loadings. The catalysts were dried at 120 °C for 10 h and calcined at 550 °C for 4 h. A Pd/Al2O3 reference catalyst with nominal 1.2 % Pd weight loading was synthesized via wetness impregnation. Al2O3 was provided by BASF and contained 10 % La to stabilize the Al2O3 in the gamma phase. The catalysts were dried at 120 °C for 10 h and calcined at 550 °C for 4 h. Following the calcination, the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst underwent an aging treatment to increase the Pd particle size. The aging treatment was performed by exposing the catalyst for 50 h to a gas mixture that cycled through neutral, reducing and oxidizing conditions. In each cycle, there was a sequence of 40 s of 10 % CO2 and 10 % H2O, followed by 10 s of 3 % CO, 1 % H2, 10 % CO2 and 10 % H2O, and another 10 s of 3 % O2, 10 % CO2 and 10 % H2O, all diluted in N2 [45,46]. The ageing treatment was carried out at 550, 650, 750 and 850 °C. This diverse set of samples was used to validate the technique and when it should be used. 2.2 Physical characterization Ceria particle sizes were verified via scanning transmission electron micrographs (STEM), collected on a Themis 60–300 kV transmission electron microscope in HAADF mode. Ceria was also characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), using an Empyrean Multipurpose X-ray diffractometer with a Cu anode (λ = 0.1542 nm). Ceria particle sizes from the XRD patterns were estimated using the Scherrer equation. Catalysts and support surface areas were measured with N2 physisorption isotherms obtained at −196 °C. The analysis was performed on a Micromeritics ASAP2020 Plus using the BET method. H2 chemisorption was performed on a Micromeritics ASAP2020 Plus. The catalysts were reduced with H2 at 300 °C for 1 h and then the system was evacuated for 2 h. The temperature was then decreased to 35 °C, and the system was evacuated for another hour before H2 exposure. H2 adsorption isotherms were obtained at 35 °C. The dispersion was measured from the total adsorption isotherm, assuming a H:Pd ratio 1:1. 2.3 CO and CO2-CO chemisorption Dispersion measurements were performed using a Micromeritics ASAP2020 Plus, using CO as a probe molecule. Two experimental procedures were used to validate the effectiveness of the modified CO chemisorption method. Method 1 – conventional CO chemisorption: Prior to CO adsorption, the catalysts were reduced in H2 at 300 °C for 1 h then evacuated at 300 °C for 2 h. The temperature was then decreased to 35 °C, where the system remained under evacuation for 1 h. Method 2 – CO2-CO chemisorption: The catalysts underwent a reduction treatment in H2 at 300° for 1 h, followed by evacuation for 2 h at 300 °C. The temperature was then decreased to 35 °C and the system remained under evacuation for 1 h. Afterwards, the catalysts were exposed to CO2 for 1 h and evacuated for 1 h to remove any residual CO2 from the system. CO adsorption isotherms were collected at 35 °C. The dispersion, obtained from the total chemisorption, was calculated by assuming a CO:Pd ratio of 1:1. The particle sizes were calculated using the inverse of the dispersion, assuming hemispherical shaped nanoparticles. 2.4 Diffuse reflectance infra-red Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) DRIFTS experiments were performed using a Nicolet iS50 FT-IR spectrometer. The catalyst was loaded in a custom-made Harrick Scientific split-cell design with low dead volume that minimizes gas phase interference. A more detailed description on the DRIFTS cell is described elsewhere [22]. CO was used as a probe molecule to assess the extent of carbonate formation on the support and the metal speciation. All the inlet gases first flowed through an isopropanol-dry ice cold trap to remove any residual moisture. The catalysts were pretreated in 1 % O2/Ar at 400 °C for 30 min to clean the catalyst surface. The temperature was then decreased to 300 °C, the cell purged with Ar and then a reduction was performed with 5 % H2/Ar at 300 °C for 30 min. After cooling in Ar to 35 °C and taking a background of the pre-treated catalyst, the sample was exposed to 5000 ppm CO at 35 °C until saturation. To evaluate the efficacy of the CO2-CO chemisorption, following the treatment described above, the catalysts were exposed to 1 % CO2/Ar. The system was then purged with inert gas until no changes in the spectra were detected. A new background spectrum from the CO2-passivated catalyst was recorded before exposing the catalysts to 5000 ppm CO, diluted in Ar, until saturation. This step was necessary to facilitate the detection of any eventual further carbonate formation during CO adsorption. 2.5 CO oxidation kinetics The catalyst was placed in a 4 mm quartz tube, which was placed in a Thermo Scientific Lindberg Blue M tube furnace. Inlet and outlet temperatures were measured using K-type thermocouples purchased from Omega. The amount of catalyst used was between 4 and 8 mg and was diluted with SiO2 to achieve a catalyst:SiO2 ratio of 1:20–40, to help prevent heat transfer limitations. To avoid internal mass transfer limitations, the catalyst was pelletized and sieved to an 80–170 mesh size. The total flowrate was 500 sccm. The catalysts were pre-treated in 5 % H2 diluted in N2 at 300 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixture included 5000 ppm CO and 2500 ppm O2, diluted in N2. The gases were metered using MKS mass flow controllers. Wet experiments were performed with the Pd/Al2O3 catalysts and included 6 % H2O, which was introduced using a Bronkhorst controlled evaporator mixer (CEM). The CO, CO2 and H2O concentrations were measured using a MKS MG2030 FT-IR analyzer. CO oxidation rates were measured at steady-state and obtained from high to low temperature. The absence of internal mass transfer limitations was verified by ensuring that the Weisz-Prater number was lower than 1 – the largest value calculated under all conditions for all catalysts was 0.19. The turnover frequency (TOF) was ultimately calculated by normalizing the reaction rates to the metal perimeter sites, as follows: TOF = reaction rate [ mol s ] mo l Pd perimeter sites The number of perimeter sites was calculated as 0.25d-1.9 as previously reported [47,48], where d is the average diameter measured via CO2-CO chemisorption. The TOF was also obtained by normalizing the reaction by the fraction of surface and corner sites (SI section 3), calculated according to the same geometric model reported in the literature [47,48]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Physical characterization STEM images were used to verify the ceria particle size. Fig. 1 shows STEM images captured from 1 % Pd/CeO2 with nominal 10, 25 and 100 nm ceria support particle sizes. The ceria particle size on 1 % Pd/CeO2 10 nm was found to range from 8 to 10 nm. A wider range of ceria particle sizes was observed with 1 %Pd/CeO2 25 nm, spanning from 5 to 30 nm. Similarly, 1 % Pd/CeO2 100 nm showed a broad particle distribution, ranging from 20 to 100 nm. Additional images captured at various sample locations are provided in the SI (Figures S1-S6). The dimensions acquired from the STEM images were compared with the average crystallite size derived from the XRD pattern, shown in Figure S7, using the Scherrer equation and they were consistent for the 10 and 25 nm samples, listed in Table 1 . However, discrepancies between the two techniques were found for the 100 nm sample. This might be attributed to the fact that STEM images capture only a limited portion of the catalysts, while the XRD provides bulk analysis. In fact, as shown by the STEM images in Figure S4, ceria nanoparticles smaller than 100 nm are observed. We note that due to the low contrast between Pd and CeO2, it was not possible to visualize any Pd particles. There was one exception, for the 1 % Pd/CeO2 25 nm sample, as shown in Figure S3, where one 1–1.5 nm particle was detected and confirmed by EDS analysis. The dark spots observed on the 1 % Pd/CeO2 10 nm and 1 % Pd/CeO2 100 nm supports do not correspond to Pd nanoparticles, as confirmed by EDS in Figure S5. These dark spots might be voids inherent of the ceria structure [49]. Surface areas measured via BET analysis on the 1 %Pd/CeO2 samples, and the corresponding bare supports are listed in Table 2 . Overall, the surface area increases as the ceria particle size decreases, for both bare ceria and Pd/CeO2 catalysts. 4 CO DRIFTS CO chemisorption has been found unreliable in measuring the number of active metal surface sites on ceria-supported catalysts, due to the interactions between CO and the ceria support. CO adsorbs on the metal site as intended, but carbonates form on the support through reaction between CO and ceria lattice oxygen, as shown in the equation R1, and increase the CO uptake [15]. Pd-CO + CeO2 → Pd-CO2 + CeO2-x → Pd + CeO2-x(COO−)(R1) To characterize and confirm the interaction between CO and ceria-supported catalysts, we spectroscopically evaluated CO adsorption on 1 % Pd/CeO2 catalysts using DRIFTS. The results shown in Fig. 1 (a) were obtained from the 3 catalysts with ceria particle sizes ranging from 10 to 100 nm. The peaks at 2080 cm−1 correspond to CO linearly adsorbed on Pd, while the broad features spanning from 2000 to 1800 cm−1 are assigned to bridge bound CO on Pd [50,51]. The features below 1700 cm−1 correspond to carbonates on the support [52]. By comparing Fig. 2 (a) and (b), where bare ceria was exposed to CO, carbonate formation on ceria is promoted by the presence of Pd [14,53]. In comparing the carbonate bands in Fig. 2, and noting the similarities in the intensities of the linear Pd-CO bands between the 3 samples, the relative intensity of the carbonate bands increases with a decrease in ceria nanoparticle size. Among all the catalysts studied, the Pd/CeO2 10 nm sample results in the most carbonate formed, and Pd/CeO2 100 nm led to the smallest. This trend could be related to the increase in oxygen mobility and the facile formation of oxygen vacancies with decreasing ceria size [54–56]. Theoretical studies showed that oxygen mobility has a high energy cost on extended surfaces [54]. However, this cost decreases on undercoordinated sites, such as edges and corners, and the fractions of these sites increase with decreasing particle size [56–63]. During CO exposure, ceria lattice oxygen reacts with CO adsorbed on the metal site, leading to carbonate formation on the support [55,59,64,65]. A similar process was proposed to occur during H2 reduction on a Pt/CeO2 catalyst, where lattice oxygen migrates onto the metal and it continuously reacts with H2, reducing the metal and forming water which desorbs [66]. The enhanced oxygen mobility with decreasing ceria particle size has also been confirmed experimentally via CO-TPR and Raman spectroscopy [51]. In addition, the higher surface area that characterizes the 10 nm and 25 nm particles might contribute to the more intense carbonate bands observed. This is consistent with CO2 adsorption DRIFTS spectra shown in Figure S9, performed on CeO2 of 10 and 100 nm nominal particle sizes. Even in the absence of the metal site, more carbonate formation on the 10 nm ceria was observed. Therefore, this might be attributed not only to the higher lattice oxygen mobility, as mentioned above, but also to its higher surface area compared to the 100 nm sample, as shown in Table S1. As previously suggested, carbonate formation on ceria-supported catalysts can undermine the reliability of both static and dynamic CO chemisorption, leading to an overestimation of the CO uptake [15]. During a typical chemisorption analysis, the catalyst is exposed to a probe molecule, in this case CO, until an adsorbed monolayer on the metal is achieved. At this point, the metal is saturated and is not able to adsorb additional gas. In the case of ceria-supported catalysts, when CO interacts with ceria’s lattice oxygen, carbonate can form directly on the support and also at the metal-support interface. The latter can then move to the support, and as this CO migrates to the support, the metal site is available for more CO adsorption. This is consistent with the CO DRIFTS spectra in Fig. 2 (a) and (b). Overall, this results in a higher CO uptake, which often leads to an erroneous CO:Pd ratio higher than 1. However, as shown in the DRIFTS spectra in Fig. 2 (a), we can hypothesize that the CO uptake is affected to different extents depending on ceria particle size. The CO uptake on Pd supported on small ceria nanoparticles is larger than the Pd supported on larger ceria nanoparticles, as a result of a higher oxygen mobility and therefore more carbonate formation. This hypothesis is further supported when comparing the varying carbonate band intensities on ceria catalysts with different ceria sizes and the features observed during CO adsorption on the reference Pd/Al2O3 fresh catalyst. Figure S10 shows the CO adsorption spectra from the Pd/Al2O3 catalysts. The spectrum has a feature at 2088 cm−1, assigned to linear Pd-CO, and a broader feature between 2000 and 1800 cm−1, corresponding to bridge Pdx-CO. The features below 1700 cm−1 correspond to carbonates formed on the support, and for the fresh catalyst their intensity is comparable to the CO-Pd features intensity. It is known that carbonate formation on irreducible supported catalysts, such as Al2O3, is usually minimal. In this case, the presence of 10 % La could lead to some enhancement in carbonate formation, as reported for Al2O3 supports doped with alkali earth metals [67–69]. However, these carbonates formed on the alumina support are not expected to influence the measured dispersion from CO uptake during CO chemisorption, in the case of the fresh catalyst. This is attributed to the fact that Al2O3, unlike ceria, does not easily lose oxygen atoms that can react with CO [55]. Therefore, since carbonate features observed on the alumina-supported catalyst exhibit comparable intensities to Pd-CO bands, we can further hypothesize that if the carbonate intensity on some other sample is similar to that of the Pd-CO features, the CO chemisorption measurement likely will not be overestimated. This is confirmed below. 5 CO2-CO DRIFTS CO2 pre-adsorption was previously proposed as a step prior to CO adsorption, to saturate the ceria surface via carbonate formation and leave the metal sites available for CO adsorption [14]. The previous method included a H2 treatment at room temperature between the CO2 and CO exposure to reduce the metal site. Since exposing Pd/CeO2 catalysts to H2 at room temperature could cause beta Pd hydride formation, here, we propose a modified method without the intermediate reduction and verify it via DRIFTS CO2-CO exposure. Fig. 3 shows the spectra taken after CO2 adsorption, an Ar purge and subsequent CO adsorption on 1 % Pd/CeO2 25 nm. We reiterate that at the end of the purge after CO2 adsorption and before CO adsorption, a new background spectrum was taken. This was done to better observe any changes in the portion of the spectrum between 1700 and 750 cm−1. The first spectrum was obtained after saturating the catalyst with CO2. CO2 exposure caused carbonate and bicarbonate species formation, represented by the features below 1700 cm−1 [52]. The lack of features between 2100 and 1700 cm−1, associated with CO adsorbed on Pd, confirms that there was no CO2 dissociation and subsequent CO adsorption on the Pd sites. After purging the catalyst with Ar, carbonate species bands decreased in intensity, suggesting a partial decomposition/desorption of weakly adsorbed species on/from the ceria surface. The time evolution of the carbonate species is shown in detail in Figure S11. Despite the partial loss, the remaining carbonate species are stable on the ceria surface, suggesting that the ceria surface is at least partially covered by C-containing species. CO adsorption performed after CO2 pre-adsorption shows that exclusively Pd metal sites are available for CO adsorption. Only features between 2100 and 1800 cm−1 are observed. The feature at 2078 cm−1 is assigned to CO linearly adsorbed to Pd, while the broad peak in the 2000–1700 cm−1 range is assigned to bridge bound CO on Pd, characterized by different coordination environments [50,51]. No peaks above 2100 cm−1 were observed, confirming that the catalyst retained its metallic state and the CO2 did not dissociate and partially oxidize the metal. No peaks below 1800 cm−1 were detected, showing that no further carbonates are formed upon CO exposure. The spectra shown in Fig. 3 indicate that CO2 pre-adsorption is able to passivate the ceria surface, leaving Pd sites available for CO adsorption. As previously suggested, CO2 reacts with lattice oxygen at the metal-support interface to form carbonates [70], inhibiting any further reaction upon CO adsorption. This experiment was also performed on 1 % Pd/CeO2 with 10 and 100 nm ceria as the support (Figure S12), along with Pd/CeO2 with 1 µm ceria characterized by different Pd loadings (Figure S13). Additionally, CO2-CO adsorption was validated using a 1.2 % Pd/Al2O3 catalyst (Figure S14 (a)), which was selected as a reference catalyst due to the lack of oxygen storage capacity associated with the support and therefore its inability to form a large amount of carbonates. As shown in the DRIFTS spectra in Figure S12, during CO exposure after CO2 saturation none of the catalysts showed new carbonate formation, except for 1 % Pd/CeO2 10 nm. In the case of the 1 % Pd/CeO2 with 10 nm ceria particles, we hypothesize that the small amount formed will not significantly affect the CO-uptake following CO2 pre-adsorption. This is based on the intensity relative to the carbonates formed on the support being comparable to the intensity of Pd-CO features, similar to the carbonates observed on the fresh Pd/Al2O3 catalyst in Figure S10 as discussed above. Despite not knowing the extinction coefficient to quantify the amount of carbonates on the support, we assume that carbonates on Al2O3 and ceria supports with similar intensities to Pd-CO features do not significantly affect the CO uptake during CO chemisorption. These results suggest that CO2 pre-adsorption successfully hinders carbonate formation upon CO adsorption, while also not modifying the metal sites. This step should allow CO-uptake measurements without carbonate interference. The DRIFTS spectra collected on the catalysts under investigation consistently show that the modified CO2-CO adsorption method is effective across the sizes of ceria spanning from 10 nm to 1 µm. For ceria with particle sizes smaller than 10 nm, the proposed method might still be limited and CO2-CO adsorption analysis using DRIFTS is suggested to ensure that carbonate formation during CO adsorption does not interfere with CO-uptake. Similar to the observations from the CO-DRIFTS spectra, the intensity of carbonates formed on the ceria surface during CO2 adsorption depends on the ceria particle size, with the intensity increasing with decreasing ceria size. Ceria size influences the mobility and accessibility of lattice oxygen at the metal-support interface. However, CO2 saturation effectively hinders any further reaction between CO and ceria lattice oxygen for all the ceria sizes under study (Figure S12). The effect of metal loading was also investigated. Using the same ceria support, as the Pd loading increases, carbonate formation on ceria decreases, as shown in Figure S13. Also in this case, varying the Pd loading does not negatively impact the efficacy of the CO2-CO adsorption method. In conclusion, the modified CO2 pre-adsorption followed by CO adsorption method represents a viable method to reduce carbonate formation during CO adsorption and reduce interference on CO uptake. This method can be used on catalysts characterized by different CeO2 particle sizes and different Pd loadings. Additionally, as shown by the DRIFTS spectra in Fig. 2 (a), carbonate formation more significantly affects the CO uptake on smaller ceria particles, because of the higher oxygen mobility and reactivity with CO. As a consequence, CO2 pre-adsorption should have a more pronounced effect on smaller ceria particles compared to larger ones. 5.1 CO and CO2-CO chemisorption Dispersion measurements were performed on Pd/CeO2 catalysts with different ceria particle sizes, along with a Pd/Al2O3 sample, used as a reference catalyst. Fig. 4 displays the comparison between the dispersion measurements obtained by performing CO2-CO and CO chemisorption. A detailed list of the dispersions and the corresponding particle sizes is provided in Table S1 in the SI. The modified CO2-CO chemisorption method was initially validated on the Pd/Al2O3 reference catalyst. As expected, the dispersions measured on the fresh 1.2 % Pd/Al2O3 catalyst using both CO2-CO and CO chemisorption exhibit similar values, with differences falling within what we consider an acceptable 5 % experimental error. These results confirm our previous assumption, based on the analysis of DRIFTS spectra in Figure S10(a) and previous literature reports, that carbonate formation on Pd/Al2O3 does not have an effect on dispersion measurements. In addition, the similar dispersions obtained from both methods confirm that CO2 is not affecting the metal site and causing any structural changes. As further support to this statement, DRIFTS spectra in Figure S14 also show that CO-Pd features obtained with and without CO2 pre-adsorption are similar. For ceria-containing catalysts, the dispersion obtained via CO chemisorption increases with decreasing ceria particle size, with the 10 nm sample resulting in a physically unrealistic 147 % value. Typically, the CO uptake obtained from CO chemisorption on metals dispersed on non-reducible supports, such as Al2O3 or SiO2, is indicative of metal dispersion, however, as previously discussed, CO chemisorption on reducible support catalysts is susceptible to errors due to carbonate formation, which leads to an overestimation of the CO uptake and consequently to an overestimation of dispersion measurements. Therefore, the observed increase in dispersion with decreasing ceria nanoparticle size measured by CO chemisorption is attributed to two factors: (i) a higher dispersion of Pd metal nanoparticles and (ii) carbonate formation on ceria enhanced by the high mobility of lattice oxygen. These reasons lead to unphysical values such as those measured on 1 % Pd/CeO2-10 nm, where the dispersion exceeded 100 %. CO2 adsorption prior to CO chemisorption should limit the influence of carbonate formation on CO uptake. This is achieved by hindering the reaction between CO and lattice oxygen, as shown by the CO2-CO adsorption DRIFTS spectra in Figure 3, S12 and S13. The dispersions measured using CO2-CO adsorption are lower than those determined via CO chemisorption, with the exception of Pd/CeO2 catalysts with ceria nanoparticles larger than 100 nm. While with CO2-CO chemisorption, the 1 % Pd/CeO2 on 10 and 25 nm ceria particles show similar dispersion, the CO chemisorption shows higher dispersion for the smallest ceria NP under study, consistent with the CO DRIFTS results that showed the highest carbonate formation. This suggests that carbonate formation is not only related to the metal-support interface [71], which, in this case is similar between the two catalysts, but also to the oxygen mobility of ceria. However, in the case of Pd/CeO2 with ceria nanoparticles larger than 100 nm, the dispersions measured with the two methods are similar. This implies that the amount of carbonates formed on larger ceria nanoparticles is insufficient to significantly impact the CO uptake during CO chemisorption, similar to what was observed in the fresh Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. Overall, the dispersions obtained via CO2-CO chemisorption show higher Pd dispersion as the ceria particle size decreases. This trend aligns with previous literature reporting that smaller ceria nanoparticles exhibit stronger metal support interactions, resulting in higher metal dispersion. Smaller nanoparticles are indeed characterized by a higher fraction of defect sites where the metal clusters bind more strongly [72]. In addition, the dispersion measurements are consistent with CO-DRIFTS spectra in Fig. 2 (a). From the comparison of the linear CO-Pd peak position of the Pd/CeO2 10 and 100 nm samples, with ceria purchased from the same supplier, it is located at a higher wavenumber for the Pd/CeO2 100 nm compared to the Pd/CeO2 10 nm sample, characterized by smaller Pd particle size. This is consistent with the Blyholder model which states that the stretching frequency depends on the π-back donation, which is also related to the particle size [73]. As the particle size decreases, the back-bonding donation from the metal to CO increases, resulting in a red shift in the metal-CO stretching frequency. The catalyst with ceria purchased from a different supplier (Pd/CeO2 25 nm) exhibits broader linear and bridged Pd-CO features, potentially caused by a different coordination environment [74], a broader distribution of particle sizes and facets, having a very distinct cubic shape, and/or the lack of darker spots, as hinted from the observed particle heterogeneity in STEM images (Fig. 1 and Figure S3). CO2-CO chemisorption results show that the CO2 pre-adsorption step results in a lower count of exposed metal sites supported on ceria supports characterized by smaller ceria particle size. Fig. 4 shows that CO chemisorption values obtained with the 25 nm ceria particle catalyst has a dispersion around 30 % higher than that from the CO2-CO chemisorption, while for the 10 nm ceria particle sample, the traditional CO chemisorption results in a value two-times higher than that of the modified method. However, the measurement difference decreased with the larger ceria nanoparticles as the amount of carbonate formed is not large enough to significantly affect CO uptake. H2 chemisorption at 35 °C was also performed to compare to the results obtained from the CO2-CO chemisorption analysis. Due to the small Pd particle size measured via CO2-CO chemisorption, the formation of palladium hydrides would be impeded because of the low H2 solubility in small particles [9]. In addition, previous literature reported that a H2 pretreatment at temperatures lower than 400 °C could suppress hydrogen spillover on a ceria-zirconia supported catalyst [75]. Given our reducing temperature of 300 °C, it might therefore be possible that H spillover could be eliminated. However, as shown in Table S2, the measured dispersion measurements exceeded the H:Pd of 1, giving unphysical results. The 136 % dispersion obtained via H2 chemisorption on the 1.2 % Pd/CeO2 1 um catalyst can at least be partially explained by Pd hydride formation, as evidenced by the adsorption isotherm shown in Figure S15. This catalyst, characterized by an average Pd particle size of 10 nm, measured via CO2-CO and CO chemisorption (Table S1), would have H2 solubility, as suggested by literature [9]. However, we attribute the high dispersion measured on the Pd/CeO2 10 and 25 nm samples to hydrogen spillover from the metal particles to the support. This is supported by the absence of the typical isotherm shape indicative of Pd hydride formation, instead displaying the typical Langmuirian isotherm, as shown in Figure S16. Typically, for particles smaller than 2.8 nm, hydrogen will “simply” adsorb on the catalyst surface and not participate in the formation of the hydride. This is because with decreasing particle size, there is a decrease in the number of interstitial sites relative to the surface sites and therefore a lower number of sites where hydrogen can diffuse [10]. Finally, in the case of Pd/CeO2-100 nm, which exhibited the highest dispersion value, we speculate that the high H uptake could be a result of both Pd hydride formation and hydrogen spillover processes occurring at the same time. CO2-CO chemisorption was also performed on the Pd/Al2O3 catalysts exposed to high temperature. The comparison between the results obtained via CO2-CO and CO chemisorption is listed in Table S3. From the CO DRIFTS spectra (Figure S10), we observed that carbonate band intensities increase relative to the Pd-CO intensity as the ageing temperature increases. This is consistent with a decrease in Pd surface area due to the sintering induced by the ageing treatment. However, as the particle size exceeds 10 nm, and there is only a small amount of CO uptake on the large metal particle, the dispersions obtained via CO chemisorption may become unreliable due to increasing relative interference caused by the CO associated with formation of carbonates on the support, similar to what was observed on ceria-supported catalysts. To overcome this issue, we employed the CO2-CO chemisorption method. From the comparison of the two methods, the dispersions obtained via CO chemisorption show a higher CO uptake, which correlates again with more carbonates observed, relative to CO bound to the metal site. For the 1.2 % Pd/Al2O3 catalyst aged at 650 °C, we compared the result from the CO2-CO chemisorption and the result of the average Pd crystallite size calculated with the Scherrer equation (Figure S17). The results show similar values, implying that the CO2-CO chemisorption could be used on catalysts with non-reducible supports which are characterized by larger metal particle sizes, such as those that underwent an ageing treatment. The 1.2 % Pd/Al2O3 catalysts aged at 750 and 850 °C resulted in a lower dispersion when using the CO2-CO chemisorption in comparison to the measurement obtained via CO chemisorption, however, the values approach the 5 % error measurement. The modified CO2-CO chemisorption technique is able to measure the metal site surface area, avoiding carbonate interference which particularly affects ceria containing catalysts. However, this method can also be expanded and employed with catalysts with irreducible supports but characterized by large particle size, since CO chemisorption might become affected by a relatively increasing carbonate interference. 5.2 CO oxidation kinetics To validate the accuracy of the particle size measurements obtained via CO2-CO chemisorption we used CO oxidation kinetics. CO oxidation on ceria-supported catalysts has been extensively studied and a consensus on the mechanism and the active site has been established. On Pd/CeO2 catalysts, CO oxidation reaction rates exhibit a particle size dependence, with the reaction rates increasing with decreasing metal nanoparticle size. Previous studies indeed demonstrate that the reaction occurs at the interface between the metal nanoparticle and the support, where CO adsorbed on the nanoparticle reacts with oxygen from the support [76–78]. A decrease in particle size correlates with an increase in the fraction of perimeter sites, as shown in Figure S19, and an increase in activity. The fraction of perimeter sites, along with the surface and corner sites, was obtained using reported correlations based on a geometric model which was developed from HRTEM images assuming a truncated cubooctahedral shape for metal nanoparticles [47,48]. Based on these findings, we expect that the CO oxidation turnover frequencies (TOF), obtained by normalizing the reaction rates by the perimeter sites, are the same for all the Pd/CeO2 catalysts studied. Fig. 5 shows the CO oxidation Arrhenius plot obtained from the 1 % Pd/CeO2 catalysts. The measured apparent activation energy for all the catalysts was ∼ 50 kJ/mol, consistent with previously reported activation energies ranging between 40 and 70 kJ/mol. CO oxidation on reducible oxide-supported catalysts often follows a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [55]. In this case, the support is directly involved in the reaction by providing reactive oxygen atoms. Here, CO reacts with a lattice oxygen from the ceria, forming CO2 [79–82]. The process leads to formation of an oxygen vacancy, resulting in a change in the ceria stoichiometry from CeO2 to CeO2-x and a change in the formal oxidation state from Ce4+ to Ce3+. The catalytic cycle concludes with ceria reoxidation from 3+ to 4+ using molecular oxygen, which is able to refill the oxygen vacancy and restore the initial state of the support [83,84]. According to the proposed mechanism, the reaction rate was found to follow a 0th order dependency on CO partial pressure, and 1st order dependence on O2 [48]. This indicates that CO is not able to suppress the reaction by hindering O2 adsorption and dissociation, which is the prevalent mechanism occurring on irreducible oxide-supported catalysts [85]. Due to the presence of the metal, the reducibility of the support is enhanced through the contact between the metal and the oxide. Therefore, it is easier to extract an oxygen. This is why, as mentioned above, CO oxidation occurs at the metal-support interface, where it is easier to remove the oxygen [48]. Although there is evidence that very small ceria particle sizes can lead to changes in the reaction mechanism [51], for the range of particle sizes we evaluated, there appears to be no change in the CO oxidation mechanism, with evidence stemming from the same apparent activation energy measured on all the catalysts with varying ceria nanoparticles. The TOFs derived by the normalization of the reaction rate by the total number of Pd surface sites, estimated from chemisorption, are shown in Figure S20 and exhibits decreasing TOF with increasing Pd particle size. Note that CO oxidation rates obtained on Pd/CeO2-10, and 25 nm are overlapping, due to their similar dispersion, confirming the validity of CO2-CO chemisorption method and the hypothesis that the carbonates formed on the support do not affect dispersion measurements if the intensity is comparable with that of the Pd-CO feature, as shown in Figure S12. However, if we normalize the reaction rates by the fraction of perimeter sites, and derive the Arrhenius plot, shown in Fig. 5, the turnover frequencies for all the catalysts under study overlap. In addition, we normalized the reaction rates by the fraction of corner sites, as shown in Figure S21. The TOFs overlap suggesting that corner sites could also be assigned as the active sites. This is consistent with a previous study, where it appears that rate measurements for metal nanoparticles smaller than 3 nm show that corner sites could be the most active [48]. This suggests that both corner and perimeter sites play a role, and their relative fractions change with particle size as shown in Figure S19. Corner sites activity appear to be predominant on smaller nanoparticles, while perimeter sites become predominant as the metal size increases [47,48]. The CO2-CO chemisorption validity on aged Pd/Al2O3 catalysts was also verified using CO oxidation. In the case of metals dispersed on irreducible oxides, CO oxidation follows a different mechanism from the one previously described for ceria-supported catalysts. CO oxidation on Pd/Al2O3 follows the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, and the mechanism includes CO initially adsorbing on the metal site, hindering adsorption and dissociation of O2. CO has to desorb to allow O2 dissociation and the surface reaction between CO and O [85,86]. For this reason, it is widely reported that the CO oxidation apparent activation energy corresponds to the CO desorption energy, falling within the range of 70–210 kJ/mol, [87]. Fig. 6 shows the CO oxidation Arrhenius plot on Pd/Al2O3 aged catalysts. The TOF was obtained by normalizing the reaction rate by the number of surface active sites, measured via CO2-CO chemisorption. The apparent activation energy derived was similar to the CO desorption energy from Pd metal [85]. In addition, the TOFs are similar across all the catalysts, suggesting that the CO2-CO chemisorption provided a good particle size estimate, including for metal supported catalysts with metal nanoparticles larger than 10 nm. 6 Conclusions Characterizing ceria-supported catalysts via CO chemisorption is challenging due to the interactions between CO and the support. In fact, CO reacts with ceria lattice oxygen leading to carbonate formation, which contributes to an overestimation of the CO uptake and, consequently, metal dispersion. The extent of carbonate formation depends on the ceria particle size with smaller ceria nanoparticles showing the most carbonate formation, while larger particle sizes less. This trend is consistent with the higher oxygen mobility as the ceria size decreases [55,56,63]. We show that ceria nanoparticles larger than 100 nm exhibit minimal carbonate formation, similar to the case of irreducible oxide-supported catalysts. This leads to a negligible effect on the CO uptake and a reliable dispersion measurement. However, as the ceria particle size decreases, the dispersion measurement becomes impacted by the growing carbonate formation, often providing unphysical results with CO:Pd ratios exceeding 1. To reduce carbonate formation during CO adsorption, CO2 pre-adsorption was added as an additional step in the static CO chemisorption procedure. DRIFTS experiments confirmed that CO2 interacts with lattice oxygen forming carbonates and prevents any further reaction between CO and ceria lattice oxygen during CO exposure. We validated the dispersion measurements obtained through CO2-CO chemisorption by performing CO oxidation kinetics. The turnover frequencies obtained by the normalization of the reaction rate by the number of perimeter sites – the active site for CO oxidation – were similar, confirming that CO2-CO chemisorption can provide a good particle size estimate. Despite this work being mainly focused on Pd/CeO2 catalysts, this CO2-CO chemisorption also proved useful when measuring CO uptake on Pd/Al2O3 samples characterized by larger Pd particles, as the relative amount of CO on the metal vs the amounts of carbonates formed shifted to the latter, ultimately being enough to alter the dispersion measurement.

        "dc:description": "Characterizing ceria-containing catalysts via common characterization techniques can be challenging. CO chemisorption is usually used to measure catalyst dispersion. However, the reaction between CO and ceria lattice oxygen leads to significant carbonate formation, resulting in an overestimation of the CO uptake and metal dispersion. Here, we propose a modified method to characterize ceria-containing catalysts which involves exposing the catalyst to CO2 prior CO adsorption to prevent further carbonate formation during CO chemisorption. We tested this method on Pd/CeO2 catalysts characterized by different ceria particle sizes and validated it via DRIFTS and CO oxidation kinetics. Validation conducted using CO oxidation kinetics showed that the TOFs derived by normalizing the reaction rates by the interfacial sites, which are the active sites, are similar for all the catalysts under investigation. Our results show that CO2-CO chemisorption can be a reliable technique for estimating metal dispersion of ceria-supported catalysts.",
