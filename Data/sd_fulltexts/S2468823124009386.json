The constraining relationships between Cu-based catalyst ligands and catalytic performance need to be elucidated. Herein, activated carbon (AC) supported Cu-based catalyst stabilized by tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) ligands are constructed and evaluated in acetylene hydrochlorination. The developed 0.5 wt.% CuTPP/AC catalyst exhibits outstanding performance comparable to highly loaded copper-based catalysts. Detailed characterisations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the addition of TPP ligands controlled the dispersion of Cu species and induced the generation of highly active CuN4 single-atom sites, and thereby governs the aforementioned activity gap. Diversified reaction pathways of Eley-Rideal (E-R) and Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) are coexisted owing to the minimal activation energy difference of 0.2 eV, which ensures the durability of CuTPP/AC catalyst. The developed extremely low loading Cu-based catalyst provides necessary potential for industrial applications.

PVC is primarily manufactured from vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) by either ethylene oxychlorination or acetylene hydrochlorination [3–7]. Acetylene hydrochlorination presents the potential benefits of a single reaction step and comparatively low running costs than vinyl oxychlorination, but demands activated carbons supported mercuric chloride (HgCl2/AC) catalysts [8–10]. Thus, designing an efficient, long-lasting, and economical catalyst to substitute the toxic HgCl2/AC catalyst remains a significant challenge in VCM production [11]. Most recently, carbon-based material supported gold (Au) [12–14], palladium (Pd) [10,15], platinum (Pt) [16], and ruthenium (Ru)-based [17–19] catalysts have been considered to be the most promising alternatives due to their exceptional catalytic activity and durability, which to certain extent depends on the precise conformation of active sites at the atomic dimension. Despite positive first pilot assessments, no commercial applications have been reported to far [20–24]. The integration of such catalysts into existing industrial systems presents a significant impediment, namely the considerable operating costs that will be accrued over the entire life cycle. Currently, the urgent imperative is to synthesise catalysts utilising inexpensive, non-toxic and abundant transition metals that can achieve the level of catalytic performance exhibited by noble metal-based catalysts [25–27]. The researchers proceeded to boost the catalytic performance by precisely regulating the local coordination environment of metal sites through different ligands incorporation, thereby optimising the electronic structure and geometrical configuration [28–31]. Furthermore, the dispersion and stability of the metal atoms on the supports were effectively controlled by regulating the interaction strength between ligands and metals [32–34]. In general, the high loading copper-based catalysts have made predominant advancements in enhancing catalytic activity on the basis of the aforementioned demands. However, one non-negligible problem is that the generation of low-activity, large-particle copper species, which considerably impede the maintenance of high activity. This highlights the necessity to develop low loading, high activity, and durable copper-based catalysts for acetylene hydrochlorination. Enlightened by this, we report a facile and controlled synthesis strategy for activated carbon supported Copper(II) Tetraphenylporphyrin (CuTPP/AC) catalysts. The TPP ligands were used to lower the loading of copper-based catalysts and boost their activity and stability. The single atom Cu sites are isolated from each other due to the spatial site resistance effect, avoiding aggregation during the subsequent pyrolysis process, which was evidenced by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and high-angle annular darkfield scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). The 0.5CuTPP/AC catalyst exhibited superior catalytic performance competitive with high loading copper-based catalysts, narrowing the gap between Cu- and noble-metal single-atom catalysts (SACs). Furthermore, the differences in energy barriers between Eley-Rideal (E-R) and Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) reaction pathways were also determined. This work not only elucidates the intrinsic activity of extremely low loading single-atom Cu sites, but also provides a promising approach for the synthesis of Cu-based catalysts with atomic dispersion. 2 Result and discussion The pore structure of CuTPP/AC catalysts were analysed using N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. As shown in Fig. 1a and Table S2, the isotherms belonged to I-type, indicating that the catalysts possessed numerous microporous pore structures [27,35]. As the loading increased, the pore structure of the support demonstrated a transformation, which in turn precipitated the reduction in both the specific surface area and microporous volume. The alterations in pore structure were also reflected in the persistent decrease in hysteresis loop. These results together confirmed the presence of microporous supported CuTPP. Besides, the X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns of CuTPP/AC catalysts were shown in Fig. 1b. Two wide peaks at about 23° and 44°, which are ascribed on the (002) and (101) crystalline planes of the AC support, respectively [36,37]. No significant peaks correlating with Cu and TPP ligand were identified, indicating a rather small particle size and/or an amorphous form [38]. To further explore the morphology and strucuture of CuTPP/AC catalysts, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were illustrated in Fig. 2 . As shown in Fig. 2a-c, no copper species were observed, demonstrating that CuTPP were highly dispersed on the support surface. The black areas in 0.5CuTPP/AC catalyst are attributed to the build-up or aggregation of carbon layers shown in Fig. 2b. As shown in Fig. 2e-F, elemental mapping analysis revealed that Cu, N and C elements of 0.5CuTPP/AC catalyst exhibited consistent signals, which intuitively certified the uniform distribution on the support surface. The successful coordination of metal ions with the TPP ligand was preliminarily verified [27,39]. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. S1, the characteristic structure of CuTPP was further demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) [40,41]. Notably, irregularly shaped copper nanoparticles were detected and revealed no signs of crystallinity, indicating the amorphous nature of the material, which was consistent with the XRD results (Fig. 2d) [42]. For the Cu mass loadings of 0.1 0.5 and 1.0 wt.%, the dispersed copper sites may facilitate the activity and stability, and reduce the risk of agglomeration by decreasing the interactions between the metal particles. However, the formation of nanoparticles was possiblr at the Cu mass loading of 2 wt.%, albeit in limited quantities, which may potentially compromise performance. This would be elaborated upon in depth later. The activity and durability are crucial indexes of catalytic performance. The reaction rates of CuTPP/AC and 10CuCl2/AC catalysts were shown in Fig. 3a-b. 0.5CuTPP/AC, 1.0CuTPP/AC and 2.0CuTPP/AC catalysts exhibited superior catalytic activity and excellent stability without apparent deactivation during the 100 h test. 10CuCl2/AC catalyst was rapidly deactivated, which was consistent with the deactivation characteristics for conventional Cu-based catalysts [43,44]. The reaction rate increased from 0.98 to 1.14 kgVCM/kgCat.*h with the temperature from 433 K to 443 K. A further increase of reaction temperature (453 K) showed little positive effect on the catalytic activity (Fig. 3c). The experimental results indicated that elevating the reaction temperature could potentially enhance the catalytic activity of 0.5CuTPP/AC. However, increasing the Cu mass loading failed to deliver the equivalent results. The 0.5CuTPP/AC catalyst was evaluated at different GHSV(C2H2) considering its good economy and durability. The VCM yield of 0.5CuTPP/AC reached 93.08 %, 87.79 %, and 79.52 % at 25, 90, and 180 h −1, respectively, which were comparable to highly loaded copper-based catalysts shown in Table S3. No deactivation was observed in the long-term stability test, demonstrating its potential for industrial applications. In general, a high specific surface area is favourable for the excitation of activity [45]. However, as Fig. 3e illustrated, there was no clear positive correlation between the activity and the specific surface area. This suggested that the specific surface area was not the dominant factor influencing activity. It was conceivable that the intrinsic electronic state of copper in the process involving the adsorption and activation of substrate molecules may exert a more pronounced influence. To further highlight the merits of copper-based catalysts under the same loading condition, the 0.5CuCl2/AC catalyst was evaluated and showed significant deactivation at 10 h (Fig. S2). The 0.5CuTPP/AC exhibited its ability to ensure efficient conversion on the Cu sites surface, representing a breakthrough in the catalytic activity of extremely low loading Cu-based catalysts. Aided by HAADF-STEM, the dense distribution of single atoms on the support surface could be intuitively seen in Fig. 4a, which was explained by the synergy of steric and geometrical effects. On the one hand, the incorporation of phenyl substituents on the porphyrin ring increased the spatial volume of the molecule, thus conferring a large spatial reluctance, which contributed to the prevention of close intermolecular contacts and aggregation [46,47]. On the other hand, the macrocyclic structure of CuTPP and its specific size and shape exhibited excellent dispersion on the support surface [48]. X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) was used to deeply investigate the inherent electronic and coordination structure of 0.5CuTPP/AC catalyst. By comparing the white line intensity values to the reference sample, as shown in Fig. 4b, the normalized white line intensity values of the Cu foil and copper acetate are 0.98 and 1.31, respectively. The typical normalized white line intensity of CuTPP was 1.28, which tentatively suggests that the copper is predominantly at +2 valence. Additionally, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the chemical state of 0.5CuTPP/AC (Fig. S3). Distinct CuTPP characteristic peaks can be observed, further confirms the existence of Cu2+ [40]. This coincideed with the fact that the metal ions in metalloporphyrins are usually divalent [49]. In more detail, the 2p3/2 component can be divided into the well-screened peal at 934.8 eV, corresponding to a 2p3d10 L final state (characterized by a 2p core hole and a hole in the ligand band), and two satellites at 942.1 eV and 944.8 eV, both related to a 2p3d9 final state [50]. The local coordination environment was analysed by EXAFS (Fig. 4c-d). The Fourier-transformed k 2-weighted EXAFS spectra of sample where no Cu-Cu characteristic distances were detected [38]. The peak at 1.7 Å was assigned to the Cu-N coordination and the bond distance was 1.92 Å shown in Table S4, consistent with the literature results [51,52]. The average coordination number of Cu-N was 3.8 ± 0.3, reconfirming the successful coordination of CuTPP and retained the original structure of TPP. In view of this, the Cu-N tetra-coordinate structure (CuN4) will be discussed as active sites in the subsequent mechanistic analyses. Based on experimental data and characterization results, CuN4 sites were identified as the active sites (Fig. S4). To gain further insight into the catalytic activity and selectivity at these sites, comprehensive DFT calculations were conducted. The electronic structure of the monatomic CuN4 site was calculated as shown in Fig. S5, where the yellow region represents the direction of electron density transfer. There is significant electron transfer between Cu and N atoms, resulting in the formation of strong Cu-N coordination bond. The Bader charge of the Cu atom is 1.02 |e|, which is much higher than that of 0.3 |e| for the conventional CuCl2, indicating a higher oxidation state, which is usually favourable for acetylene hydrochlorination. Additionally, projection of density of states (PDOS) calculations were performed on the CuN4 sites (Fig. S6). CuTPP is a common transition metal complex characterised by high-energy d orbitals and a specific electron arrangement. When acetylene molecules are adsorbed onto the surface of CuTPP, the p orbitals of acetylene molecules overlap with the d orbitals of CuTPP, facilitating the sharing and transfer of electron density. This enhanced the activation of acetylene and hydrochlorination reaction, improving the reactivity and selectivity. Consequently, further calculations were carried out to determine the catalytic mechanism of molecular-level, with the findings displayed in Fig. 5 . Firstly, the acetylene molecule is firmly adsorbed directly above the CuTPP (Fig. 5, step b), with an adsorption energy of −0.42 eV The two carbon atoms of acetylene bind to the Cu and neighbouring N atoms, respectively, and the CC bond is broken, resulting in the formation of the HCCH* intermediate. Typically, the ease of formation of HCCH* intermediate might reflect the catalytic performance of the catalyst to some extent. Here the HCCH* intermediate formed spontaneously after the combination of the acetylene molecule and the CuTPP active sites, which predicts the excellent catalytic performance of the catalyst. Based on the classical E-R reaction mechanism, after the formation of the HCCH* intermediate, the HCl molecules in the gas phase approached to attack the HCCH* intermediate (Fig. 5, step c), and the most stable conformation of the adsorption energy for HCl molecules' contact with the HCCH* intermediate was −0.78 eV Subsequently, the activated HCl molecules reacted with the HCCH* intermediate in a one-step addition reaction to generate the vinyl chloride molecule VCM* with a reaction energy barrier of 0.64 eV, which is close to or even better than the other reported Cu-based catalysts [4,27,53–55]. Besides, the reaction path based on the L-H reaction mechanism was also taken in account. Acetylene molecules and hydrogen chloride molecules co-adsorb onto exposed CuTPP sites. Subsequently, a further addition reaction was carried out to produce the vinyl chloride molecule with a reaction barrier of 0.84 eV The reaction energy barrier of the active site in the L-H mechanism is similar to that of the E-R mechanism, which again demonstrates the great potential of the CuTPP active sites in acetylene hydrochlorination. It can be concluded that the activity sites are mainly determined by the intrinsic electronic state distribution effect on the adsorption and activation of substrate molecules. This similarity could be attributed to the inherent influence of the electronic state distribution of the CuN4 active sites on the adsorption and activation of substrate molecules, thus affecting the energy barrier of the reaction. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) was enlisted to further elucidate the substrate activation degree by active sites. Specifically speaking, the desorption temperature provides insight into the binding strength of the adsorbed substance to the catalyst surface, while the desorption area is closely correlated with the number of active sites. Fig. 6a illustrated that the C2H2 desorption temperatures of 0.5CuTPP/AC and 0.5CuCl2/AC were 493 K and 450 K, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6b, the HCl desorption temperatures of 0.5CuTPP/AC and 0.5CuCl2/AC were 490 K and 473 K, respectively [56]. The analysis of C2H2-TPD and HCl-TPD revealed that 0.5CuTPP/AC exhibited superior performance to 0.5CuCl2/AC with regard to both substrate desorption temperature and desorption area. The enhanced activation ability of C2H2 and HCl was primarily attributed to the intrinsic electronic state of copper, which corroborated with the theoretical calculations. 3 Conclusion In conclusion, low loading CuTPP/AC catalysts were synthesized controllably and evaluated in acetylene hydrochlorination. Detailed analysis of the 0.5CuTPP/AC catalyst as the model catalyst demonstrated that CuTPP was highly dispersed while ensuring efficient conversion of C2H2 and HCl on the copper sites surface. Experiments and DFT calculations demonstrated that the pivotal factor was the adsorption and activation of substrate molecules by the intrinsic electronic state distribution of copper. The stable operation under industrial test conditions for a longer period of time without significant deactivation makes it comparable to non-precious metal Cu-based catalysts with high loadings. This strategy presents a potential avenue for the advancement of acetylene hydrochlorination in vinyl chloride production, with considerable promise for industrial implementation.

        "dc:description": "The constraining relationships between Cu-based catalyst ligands and catalytic performance need to be elucidated. Herein, activated carbon (AC) supported Cu-based catalyst stabilized by tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) ligands are constructed and evaluated in acetylene hydrochlorination. The developed 0.5 wt.% CuTPP/AC catalyst exhibits outstanding performance comparable to highly loaded copper-based catalysts. Detailed characterisations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the addition of TPP ligands controlled the dispersion of Cu species and induced the generation of highly active CuN4 single-atom sites, and thereby governs the aforementioned activity gap. Diversified reaction pathways of Eley-Rideal (E-R) and Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) are coexisted owing to the minimal activation energy difference of 0.2 eV, which ensures the durability of CuTPP/AC catalyst. The developed extremely low loading Cu-based catalyst provides necessary potential for industrial applications.",
