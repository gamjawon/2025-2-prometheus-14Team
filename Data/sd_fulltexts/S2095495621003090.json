Graphical abstract A12C4 and manganese (II) ions form a stable complex in the electrolyte, which inhibits the ability of Mn2+ to degrade SEI on graphite surface and improves the cycling performance of lithium batteries. A once overlooked source of electrolyte degradation incurred by dissolved manganese (II) species in lithium-ion batteries has been identified recently. In order to deactivate the catalytic activity of such manganese (II) ion, 1-aza-12-crown-4-ether (A12C4) with cavity size well matched manganese (II) ion is used in this work as electrolyte additive. Theoretical and experimental results show that stable complex forms between A12C4 and manganese (II) ions in the electrolyte, which does not affect the solvation of Li ions. The strong binding effect of A12C4 additive reduces the charge density of manganese (II) ion and inhibits its destruction of the PF6 − structure in the electrolyte, leading to greatly improved thermal stability of manganese (II) ions-containing electrolyte. In addition to bulk electrolyte, A12C4 additive also shows capability in preventing Mn2+ from degrading SEI on graphite surface. Such bulk and interphasial stability introduced by A12C4 leads to significantly improved cycling performance of LIBs. Keywords Manganese (II) ions Electrolyte decomposition 1-Aza-12-crown-4-ether Thermal stability 1 Introduction To meet the requirements of large-scale energy storage application, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) must meet the criteria of low cost, high safety and long cycle life [1–8]. Manganese-rich (Mn-rich) cathode chemistries have been attracting intensive attention due to their lower cost and higher safety than Co-rich chemistries [9,10]. However, these cathode materials encounter persistent issue of poor cycle life. During charging/discharging, especially under the conditions of high voltage and elevated temperature, Mn4+ in the cathode materials would undergo disproportionation reaction and dissolve into the electrolyte as Mn2+ [4,11]. Driven by the electric field, such dissolved transition metal ions then migrate to and deposit upon the graphite anode surface, destroying the structure of the existing solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI) [12–19]. It has been reported that when appropriate film-forming additives were introduced into the electrolyte, the corresponding reduction and decomposition products would stabilize the transition metal ions embedded in the SEI film, thus effectively inhibiting the destructive effect of the transition metal ions on the SEI [20–23]. However, our recent work showed that, besides the destabilization of SEI by Mn2+, the residual Mn2+ in bulk electrolyte would also catalyze the decomposition of PF6 − into PF5, causing severe thermal decomposition of the electrolyte and further degrading the battery performance [24]. Therefore, inhibiting Mn2+ from catalyzing the thermal decomposition of bulk electrolyte is as important to the cycling performance and safety of the battery as the stabilization on interphase. Crown ethers are a class of organic compounds known for their strong capability of forming complexes with cations of varying sizes, which have been used to inhibit the migration of dissolved transition metal ions in the electrolyte and deposit to the graphite anode [25–32]. In this work, we demonstrated that 1-aza-12-crown-4-ether (A12C4) as an electrolyte additive suppresses the destruction of PF6 − by forming a stable complex with Mn2+, thus effectively improving the thermal stability of bulk electrolyte. The mechanisms of A12C4 in deactivating Mn2+ in electrolyte were systematically investigated by spectroscopic, density functional theory calculation, molecular dynamic simulation and electrochemical characterizations. Together with its effect on preventing Mn2+ species to destruct the SEI layer, the addition of A12C4 significantly improves the performances of LIB. The understanding could inspire the efforts of designing new electrolytes base ether structures. 2 Experimental 2.1 Density functional theory calculation Density functional theory (DFT) had been performed with the Gaussian 09 package [33]. Molecules and complexes structure were optimized with the B3LYP functional and 6-311 + + G (d) basis set [24,34]. Through frequency analysis, the optimized structure is determined to be at the lowest energy point. The solvent effect was considered by using polarized continuum model with a dielectric constant of 20.5. 3d5 was selected as the outermost electron for the calculation of Mn2+. The natural population analysis method was used to analyze the charge distribution of the systems. The possible interaction structures of ion (Li+, PF6 −, Mn2+) with solvent molecular (EC, A12C4) were considered from both solvent-ion and solvent–solvent electrostatic interactions, as well as steric hindrance. Only the most stable and optimized structures are presented in this work. 2.2 Molecular dynamic simulations The LAMMPS [35] general purpose open-source code was used for molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The electrolyte was modeled utilizing the force-field from references for Li+, PF6 − and EC [36,37]. The Mn2+ force-field parameters were token from reference [38]. The starting force-field parameters for the crown compound were extracted from amber-force field utilizing the amber’s utility tleap. The fit of crown-Mn force-field parameters were performed with the amber-sander classical MD-code suite. The amber2lammps. py python script utility was utilized to convert the configurations from amber input to lammps input. Several initial configurations were also prepared utilizing fftool and packmol [39]. The simulated system was equilibrated for several ns in NPT ensemble at 393 K and 1 atm. Then production run trajectories of about 40 ns were generated in NVT ensemble 393 K. The Nose Hoover thermostat [40] with a coupling constant of 200 fs was utilized to control the temperature. The short-range interactions (van der Waals and real space Ewald) were calculated within a 11 Å spherical cut off. The electrostatic interactions were calculated utilizing Ewald method [41] and particle mesh scheme [42] for the reciprocal part. 2.3 Sample preparation Ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) were supplied by Guangzhou Tianci Material Technology Co., Ltd., China. Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide Manganese (II) (Mn(TFSI)2) (>98%) and 1-Aza-12-crown-4-ether (A12C4)(98%) additive were purchased from Aladdin and Tokyo Chemical Industry company, respectively. The above electrolyte components/additive were used without further purification. A series of electrolyte formulations shown in Table 1 were prepared in an argon-filled glove box (MBraun, Germany) with O2 and H2O contents of less than 10 and 0.1 ppm, respectively. Graphite anode for half-cell consists of artificial graphite (80 wt.%, supplied by Dongguan Kaijin New Energy Technology Co., Ltd.), acetylene black (10 wt.%) and poly(vinylidene fluoride; 10 wt.%), which were coating on Cu foil. The average mass loading of graphite anode for half-cell is 2.6–3.0 mg cm−2. Assembly of CR2025 graphite/Li half-cell was done in a glove box using Celgard 2400 membrane separator. The lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC523)/graphite pouch cells were provided by Guangzhou Tianci Material Technology Co., Ltd., China. The NMC523 cathode consists of 97.3 wt.% active substance (NMC523: lithium manganate = 7:3), 1.2 wt.% PVDF and 0.5 wt.% conductive agent (CNT), while the graphite anode contains 95.0 wt.% graphite, 1.5 wt.% CNT, 2.0 wt.% PVDF and 1.5 wt.% carboxymethyl cellulose. 8.0 g electrolyte was injected into each NMC523/graphite pouch cell with a nominal capacity of 1000 mAh. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements The NMC523/graphite pouch cell is initially activated by charging/discharging at 0.1C and 0.5C for one cycle, respectively, followed by a long cycle at 0.1C between a voltage range of 2.75–4.20 V. All the tests were performed at room temperature. The chronoamperometric and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests were performed on Solartron-1470 instrument (England). The graphite/Li half-cell is charged/discharged at 0.1C (1C = 372.0 mA g−1) between 0.05–2.50 V for 3.5 cycles. After that, the cell is holding at 0.05 V for 20 h to obtain the chronoamperometric curve. The LSV test was performed on Pt electrode with a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 from 3.0 to 0.0 V, using lithium metal sheet as the reference electrode and counter electrode. 2.5 Physical characterization Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) before and after electrolyte storage was tested using TSQ Quantum Ultra. While the ESI-MS characterization of the white sediment of sample 6 (Fig. 3B) was performed after separating the precipitate and dissolving in acetone. The scan range is from m/e = 50–300. Methanol is used as cosolvent. The spray voltage is + 3 kv and the capillary temperature is 300 °C. The sheath gas and auxiliary gas flow rates were 30 and 5 arb, respectively. Thermal stability of the electrolyte was tested using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, PerkinElmer DSC 4000, Netherlands) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and temperature range of 25–225 °C. The surface morphology of the electrode was studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM, JM-6510, Japan) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JM-2100HR). The manganese content of the lithium sheets immersed in the electrolytes were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry with atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 A12C4 ether captures Mn2+ As shown in Fig. 1 A, while lithium foil spontaneously stabilizes itself in based electrolyte (sample 1), Mn2+ pre-dissolved in the electrolyte (sample 2) is immediately and almost completely deposits on the surface of lithium plate as a layer of black coating (pre-add amount of Mn: deposition amount of Mn = 26.4: 21.7, see Fig. 1B). With increasing content of A12C4 additive, Mn2+ deposition on lithium surface constantly decreases (Fig. 1B), indicating that A12C4 additive captures the Mn2+ in electrolyte and prevents it from depositing. When the molar ratio of A12C4 additive and Mn2+ in the electrolyte reached 2:1 (sample 6), the discoloration of lithium disappeared, and almost no Mn deposition can be detected. The light yellowish color of electrolyte after adding A12C4 mainly come from the crown itself (Fig. 1A and S1). Meanwhile, white sediment occurs with the addition of A12C4 additive into the Mn2+-containing electrolyte, which increases with the increasing of additive content. The contents of Mn in the white sediment and the remaining electrolyte were analyzed, respectively (Fig. 1C). Obviously, the changing trend of Mn content in the liquid electrolyte is consistent with Fig. 1B, that is, it decreases with the increase of additive. On the contrary, the content of Mn in the white sediment showed an upward trend and was almost equal to the initial amount of manganese addition (25.9 mg vs. 26.4 mg), indicating that the A12C4-complex with Mn2+ ions is insoluble. DFT and MD simulations and ESI-MS were used to study how A12C4 interacts with Mn2+ and the possible interaction structures (Fig. 2 ). The interaction structure and energy of Li+ and Mn2+ with EC and A12C4 molecular obtained from DFT calculation are given in Fig. 2A. It can be easily found that due to the larger charge density, the interaction energy of Mn2+ with EC and A12C4 molecular is obviously higher (more negative) than that of Li+, indicating that Mn2+ is more likely to form complex with A12C4 in the electrolyte, while Li+ solvation sheath is essentially unaffected. The energy difference between A12C4-Mn2+ and EC-Mn2+ (83.6 kJ/mol) is bigger than that of Li+ (34.6 kJ/mol), which should be ascribed to the tetrahedrally coordinated structure of A12C4-Mn2+ and the bidentate coordinated structure of A12C4-Li+. The tetrahedrally coordinated structure of A12C4-Mn2+ indicates that the cavity of A12C4 matches very well with the radius of Mn2+. While the ionic radius of Li+ (0.76 Å) is obviously smaller than that of Mn2+ (0.83 Å) [28,43], indicating that the cavity of A12C4 is too big for Li+. In good agreement with the DFT calculation, tetrahedrally coordinated A12C4-Mn2+ can be found from the MD simulation, see Fig. 2B (left). Moreover, the stronger Coulombic field of divalent cation requires that Mn2+ combines with EC solvent and PF6 − in its solvation shell at the same time. The bond length of P-F in PF6 − interacted with Mn2+ becomes shorter because of the presence of A12C4 additive (Fig. 2C), indicating that the chelation of Mn2+ by A12C4 would deactivate the polarization effect of Mn2+ on PF6 −. This should be ascribed to the decreased of charge density of Mn2+ partially neutralized by A12C4 additive (Fig. S2). Such reduced charge density of cation is much less likely to induce the structural breakdown of PF6 −. No solvation of A12C4-Li+ (m/e = 182.2) can be observed from the ESI-MS of electrolyte sample E6 (Fig. 2D, Table 1), confirming that, dynamically, it is difficult for A12C4 to form complexes with Li+. In agreement with this ESI-MS result, the MD simulations also confirmed preference of the crown to be outside the inner solvation shell of Li+ (Fig. 2B, right), likely due to the mismatch between the radius of Li+ and the cavity of A12C4. The peak at mass-charge ratios (m/e) of 176 corresponds to [H(A12C4)]+, where the H+ should mainly come from the inevitable hydrolysis reaction of LiPF6 in the electrolyte. 3.2 A12C4 ether improves electrolyte thermal stability According to Fig. 1, when the molar ratio of A12C4 to Mn2+ reaches 2:1, the dissolved Mn2+ in the electrolyte is almost completely precipitated and does not react with lithium metal. Therefore, the thermal stability of electrolyte sample 6 was chosen for further investigation and compared with electrolytes 1 and 2 (Fig. 3 ). Consistent with our previous work, in comparison with base electrolyte without Mn2+ (sample 1), the co-existence of Mn2+ and PF6 − leads to severe discoloration (electrolyte sample 2, Fig. 3B) and decomposition of electrolyte after storage at 55 °C for 8 days [24]. Differently, no visible discoloration of electrolyte occurs in presence of A12C4 additive after storage (electrolyte sample 6), which should be attributed to the scavenging of Mn2+ ions by A12C4 that inhibited the catalytic activity of Mn2+ toward PF6 − (Fig. 2C). ESI-MS also confirms the improved thermal stability of bulk electrolyte containing Mn2+ and A12C4 additive (Fig. 3C). No obvious electrolyte decomposition can be detected for electrolyte 1 after storage at 55 °C for 8 days, indicating that the commercial electrolyte is fairly stable under this temperature. While in the presence of Mn2+, a small amount of decomposition products appeared before storage. Such electrolyte decomposition was accelerated at elevated temperature, and ESI-MS become quite messy [24]. In good agreement with the results obtained from Fig. 1, no m/e peaks corresponding to Mn2+-containing complexes can be observed from Fig. 3C (electrolyte 6 before and after storage), confirming that almost no Mn2+ remains in the liquid electrolyte after treatment with A12C4 additive. The peak corresponding to [H(A12C4)]+ (m/e = 176.1) can be seen from electrolyte 6, which should be ascribed to the larger amount of A12C4 additive than that of Mn2+. Since the solvation structure of A12C4 with Mn2+ is 1:1 (Fig. 2B), free A12C4 molecules should remain in the electrolyte. Importantly, according to Fig. 3C, no obvious decomposition can be observed of electrolyte 6 before and after storage, which confirms that Mn2+, chelated by A12C4 additives, indeed lost its activity in catalyzing the thermal decomposition of PF6 −-containing electrolyte. Next, the white sediment of sample 6 (Fig. 3B, after thermal storage) was separated and dissolved in acetone for ESI-MS investigation, with the result presents in Fig. S2(B). The A12C4-Mn2+ complexes, mainly as [Mn(A12C4)(MeOH) (Acetone)]2+ (m/e = 176.0), can be clearly observed from the ESI-MS results (Fig. S2B), confirming that Mn2+ was bound to A12C4 and they were present in the white sediment. In addition, it is worth mentioning that the existence of A12C4-Mn2+-PF6 − (m/e = 497.1) in Fig. S2(B) reveals the great capability of A12C4 on preventing the destruction effect of Mn2+ toward PF6 −. While in the Mn2+-containing electrolyte without A12C4 (Fig. 3C), PF6 − interacting with Mn2+ is decomposed into Mn-F structure, such as [MnF(DMC)(MeOH)]+ (m/e = 196.0). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. 3D) further confirms the great capability of A12C4 additive on hindering the destructive effect of Mn2+ on catalyzing the thermal stability of the electrolyte. 3.3 Effect of A12C4 on LIBs cycling stability Influence of A12C4 additive and A12C4-Mn2+ complex on the cycling performance of LIBs was then investigated. To closely simulate the actual battery environment, the content of Mn2+ in electrolyte 2 and 6 was reduced from 0.3 M to 0.05 M (mark as 2S and 6S, see Table 1), and the content of A12C4 additive in electrolyte 6 was decreased accordingly to 0.1 M. Cycling performances of NMC523/graphite cells with electrolytes 1, 2S and 6S at 25 °C are shown in Fig. 4 . Capacity retention of cell with electrolyte 2S after 450 cycles drops to 12%, while the one without Mn2+ addition (electrolyte 1) matins at 87%, indicating that the presence of Mn2+ in electrolyte incurred significant damage to the cycling stability. Moreover, volume expansion can be also observed in the NMC523/graphite cell after cycling with electrolyte 2S (embedding graph in Fig. 4A), which should be mainly ascribed to the large amount of gaseous products from electrolyte decomposition caused by Mn2+ [24]. Highly acidic decomposition product of Mn2+-containing electrolyte is known to destroy the interphasial structure of electrode [24], leading to polarization increase and cycle life reduction (Fig. 4B). Severe electrolyte decomposition of electrolyte 2S in NMC523/graphite cell can also be identified from the discolored membrane after cycling (Fig. S3). The cyclic stability of NMC523/graphite cell in electrolyte 6S is comparable to that of the battery without Mn2+ addition (electrolyte 1), which indicates that A12C4 additive can effectively inhibit the damage of Mn2+ to battery performance, and that the complex formed by A12C4 and Mn2+ has no negative effect on battery performance. The interfacial morphologies of NMC523 and graphite electrodes are examined before and after cycling (Fig. 5 ). Comparing with a thin and uniform SEI layer covering on graphite electrode formed by electrolytes 1 and 6S, a thicker and nonuniform electrolyte decomposition products can be observed on the graphite after cycling with electrolyte 2S, verifying that the sever destructive effect of Mn2+ on the SEI and the capability of A12C4 on suppressing such damage. While for the morphologies of NMC523 cathode, there is no obvious difference after cycling, suggesting that both Mn2+ and A12C4 has negligible influence on the oxidation stability of electrolytes. The variation of electrode surface morphology shows that the improvement of NMC523/graphite cell cycle performance is mainly attributed to A12C4 inhibiting the thermocatalytic decomposition of Mn2+ on electrolytes and the destruction of the stability of the graphite anode interphase. LSV and Chronoamperometry characterizations are used to investigate the interphasial stability of graphite anode with electrolytes 2S and 6S. As shown in Fig. 6 A, an obvious reduction current at around 1.0 V can be seen from the LSV curve of Pt with electrolyte 2S, which should be attributed to Mn2+ catalytic electrolyte reduction decomposition. In addition, smaller reduction current of graphite anode with electrolyte 6S then that of electrolyte 2S during holding at 0.05 V (Fig. 6B), again confirms the capability of A12C4 additive on hindering the destructive effect of Mn2+ on the interphasial stability of graphite anode. It is worth mentioning that although the A12C4-Mn2+ compound has very low solubility in the electrolyte, it is necessary to study its reduction stability because it still exists in the battery system. The calculated electron affinity energy of ions solvation complexes is given in Fig. 6C, which shows that the reduction stability of A12C4 additive is higher than that of EC solvent, therefore the residual A12C4 in electrolyte will not participate in the reduction reaction. However, complexes consisting of Mn2+ shows higher reduction activity than that of Li+, suggesting that Mn2+-containing complexes would participate in the reduction reaction during the charging process of LIBs. The corresponding optimized structures of EC-Mn2+-PF6 − and A12C4-Mn2+-PF6 − after reduction are presented in Fig. 6D, where the electron is mainly distributed to PF6 −, instead of Mn2+, leading to the generation of manganese fluoride products. Due to the strong charge absorption of A12C4 additive on Mn2+, the charge distribution on manganese ions with A12C4 additive (1.64) is obviously lower than that of with EC (1.94) (Fig. 2A). This may reduce the reduction catalysis of Mn2+ on the electrolyte, and therefore, hindering its destructive effective on the interphasial stability of graphite anode. 4 Conclusions Dissolution of transition metal ions into the electrolyte would not only decrease the interphasial stability of the anode, but also catalyze the decomposition of the bulk electrolyte, leading to a sharp decline in the cycle life of the LIBs. In this work, we proposed the A12C4 crown ether, whose cavity size well matches the ionic radius of Mn2+, as electrolyte additive to form a stable complex with Mn2+ in the electrolyte to inhibit the damage of Mn2+ to the battery performance. Theoretical and experimental results show that A12C4 ether captures and stabilizes Mn2+ in the electrolyte and inhibits its thermocatalytic decomposition to the PF6 −-based electrolyte, leading to significantly improved thermal stability of bulk electrolyte. Moreover, the A12C4 would stabilize the Mn2+ in the induced SEI on graphite surface and significantly improve the cyclic stability of NMC523/graphite pouch cell.

        "dc:description": "A once overlooked source of electrolyte degradation incurred by dissolved manganese (II) species in lithium-ion batteries has been identified recently. In order to deactivate the catalytic activity of such manganese (II) ion, 1-aza-12-crown-4-ether (A12C4) with cavity size well matched manganese (II) ion is used in this work as electrolyte additive. Theoretical and experimental results show that stable complex forms between A12C4 and manganese (II) ions in the electrolyte, which does not affect the solvation of Li ions. The strong binding effect of A12C4 additive reduces the charge density of manganese (II) ion and inhibits its destruction of the PF6 − structure in the electrolyte, leading to greatly improved thermal stability of manganese (II) ions-containing electrolyte. In addition to bulk electrolyte, A12C4 additive also shows capability in preventing Mn2+ from degrading SEI on graphite surface. Such bulk and interphasial stability introduced by A12C4 leads to significantly improved cycling performance of LIBs.",
