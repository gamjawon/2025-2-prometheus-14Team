Graphical abstract The creation of more sustainable and high efficient desulfurization system, capable to operate under cost-effective conditions, led to the application of peroxopolyoxometalates as active oxidative catalysts. These compounds present active peroxo groups in their structure that promote easily the oxidation of sulfur compounds in the presence of low amounts of oxidant (H2O2/S = 4). The sustainability of the desulfurization of a multicomponent model diesel (2000 ppm S) was increased by the optimization of various parameters, such as nature and volume of extraction solvent, oxidant and catalyst. The Venturello peroxotungstate ((Bu4N)3PW4) showed to be a catalyst able to complete desulfurize a model diesel (after only 40 min), under lower amounts of solvent, oxidant and catalyst, than the analogues peroxomolybdate ((Bu4N)3PMo4) compound. Furthermore, the (Bu4N)3PW4/[BMIM]PF6 system was able to be reused for six consecutive desulfurization cycles maintaining its efficiency. The oxidized sulfur compounds were removed from [BMIM]PF6 phase in the end of each catalytic cycle. This simple procedure guarantees the cost-efficiency of the process, promoting the reuse of the catalyst and the solvent for various consecutive cycles, without the need of heterogenization techniques.

This raises a series of environmental and industrial problems, mostly related with the sulfur content in fuels [1]. The sulfur oxides (SOx) liberated during the combustion of transportation fuels are the main contributor to the acid rain, negatively affecting ecosystems and the human health [2,3]. The search for the production of ultra-clean fuels is an important research topic for academia and industry and appropriate methodologies must be applied in order to correspond to the strict legislations imposed in Europe or USA, limiting the amount of sulfur in fuel for 10 ppm [4]. The current desulfurization method applied in petroleum refining industry is the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) [5]. This technology to follow the strict sulfur limitations, harsh and high cost production conditions (350–400 ℃, 30–100 bar H2 pressure) are needed, increasing the cost of this process [6]. Also, HDS has low affinity for refractory sulfur compounds, such as benzothiophene and derivatives [7]. The high efficiency and the mild conditions presented by the oxidative desulfurization (ODS) process makes it a viable and sustainable option to complement or substitute the HDS [8,9]. Its employment involves the conciliation of an extraction and an oxidative step (ECODS) [10–15].The refractory sulfur compounds are oxidized to the corresponding sulfones and or/sulfoxides and consequently removed by application of suitable polar solvents. The efficiency and eco-sustainability of the ECODS process is highly dependent of the type of oxidant and catalyst used [16–18]. The most usual oxidants are the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), organic peroxide and molecular oxygen (O2). The “green” characteristics and the powerful oxidative ability of H2O2, as well its easily activation by several catalysts, have played an important role in the growth use of this oxidant over the past few years [19]. Polyoxometalates have shown to be active catalysts for ECODS process using model and real fuels [11,12,15,18,20–28]. Most of these reported works have describing various immobilization strategies to immobilize these active centers in support materials to prepare novel heterogeneous catalysts. However, some of these composites based in polyoxometalates have suffering of leaching [25] and others need to use acids as co-catalysts to ensure high catalytic efficiency [20–23]. Phosphorous-containing tetranuclear peroxotungstate or peroxomolybdate [PO4{MO(O2)2}4]3-, MW or Mo (hereafter abbreviated as PW4 and PMo4, respectively), also known as Venturello compound, have been successfully applied as catalysts in several oxidative reactions [29–35]. Although in an active catalytic form (resulted from the precursor Keggin polyanion [PM12O40]3−, MW, Mo) the presence of H2O2 have played a fundamental role to improve the catalytic performance of the Venturello catalysts during the ECODS process. Previously, some few work was reported using Venturello catalysts for oxidative desulfurization. [28,36–38] Most of these studies were performed using the most easily oxidized sulfur compounds (dibenzothiophene) or were extended to other sulfur compound but using single model fuels. Balula research group recently reported the use of PMo4/H2O2 combination for desulfurization of a multicomponent model and untreated real fuels presenting excellent reusability and stability for ten consecutive cycles. [34] The complex composition of real fuels showed to benefit with the presence of an extractive phase containing polar solvents, such as acetonitrile (MeCN) and ionic liquids (IL) [34,35,39–41]. ILs have been extensively studied and used as suitable reaction media and extraction solvents for desulfurization process, as a result of their negligible vapor pressure, thermal stability and recycling capacity [26,27,39,41–47]. Nowadays, a new class of solvents called as deep eutectic solvents (DES) have emerged and have been recently used in desulfurization process [48–52]. These solvents present most of the advantageous of ILs but are obtained by simpler methods and biodegradable components. In the present work, two Venturello-based compounds, denominated as PW4 and PMo4 were prepared as tetrabutylammonium salts ((Bu4N)3PMo4 and (Bu4N)3PW4) and applied as homogeneous catalysts for ECODS of a multicomponent model diesel. The catalytic performance of both catalysts was compared for the first time using a multicomponent model fuel containing simultaneously the most refractory sulfur compounds. An optimization of their catalytic performance was done using the multicomponent model fuel and H2O2 as oxidant and different extraction solvents, including an IL, DES, MeCN and also under a solvent-free system. The most efficient and cost-effective system was reused for six consecutive cycles using the most active homogeneous catalyst. The absence of activity loss was ensured by an innovative cleaning process between cycles. The Venturello catalyst stability was further analyzed. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Chemicals and methods The following chemicals and reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used as received: phosphotungstic acid hydrate (H3PW12O40·nH2O, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9 %), phosphomolybdic acid hydrate (H3PMo12O40·nH2O, Fluka, ≥99.9 %), tetrabutylammonium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, 98 %) and 30 % aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, Sigma-Aldrich), acetonitrile (Fischer Chemical, 99.99 %), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (Aldrich, 97 %), benzothiophene (Fluka, 95 %), dibenzothiophene (Aldrich, 98 %), 4-methyldibenzothiophene (Sigma-Aldrich, 98 %), 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (Alfa Aesar, 97 %), decane (Aldrich, 98 %) and tetradecane (Aldrich, 99 %). The preparation of deep eutectic solvent (DES) (TBA/PEG) was described previously [53]. Elemental analysis for C, H, and N was performed at the University of Santiago with a Leco SHNS-932. 31P NMR spectra were recorded in 5 mm tubes at room temperature on a Bruker Avance III 400 spectrometer operating at 161.9 MHz. FT-IR analysis were recorded on a Jasco 460 Plus spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out in the atmosphere of nitrogen on STA7200RV with the heating rate of 5 ℃/min. The catalytic reactions were followed using a Bruker 430-GC-FID. Hydrogen was the carrier gas (55 cm3 s−1) and fused silica SPB-5 Supelco capillary columns (30 m x0.25 mm i.d.; 25 μm film thickness) were used. 2.2 Synthesis of venturello compounds The preparation of both Venturello-based complexes followed a similar methodology, based on published procedures [54,55]. Firstly, 30 % aq. H2O2 (10 mL) was added to an aqueous solution of H3PM12O40·nH2O (M = W, Mo, 0.50 mmol, 1.44 g) and left under stirring for 60 min at room temperature. Secondly, an aqueous solution of tetrabutylammonium chloride (1.6 mmol, 0.45 g in 3 ml H2O) was added to the mixture and vigorously stirred. The resultant precipitate was filtered off and washed with water. (Bu4N)3PW4, yield: 0.9640 g (85.3 %), elemental analysis calcd.

In a typical ECODS experiment, 5 μmol of catalyst, 0.75 ml of multicomponent model diesel and 0.75 ml of extraction solvent were added into a 5 ml borosilicate reaction vessel. The mixture was left under stir and immersed in a thermostated oil bath at 70 ℃. After 10 min, the catalytic step was initiated by adding 0.26 mmol of H2O2. Three different type of extraction solvents were used, i.e. acetonitrile (MeCN), an IL ([BMIM]PF6) and a DES (TBA/PEG). During the reaction, the upper model diesel phase was constantly sampled and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) to quantify the change of sulfur concentration over time. Tetradecane was used as standard. The desulfurization efficiency was calculated according to X %=(C0-Ct)/C0 × 100 %, where X stands for the desulfurization efficiency. C0 and Ct represent the sulfur concentration at t min and initial sulfur concentration, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Venturello-based catalysts efficiency The oxidative catalytic desulfurization performance of both Venturello-based catalysts ((Bu4N)3PW4 and (Bu4N)3PMo4) (5 μmol) was studied and compared using a multicomponent model diesel (0.75 mL) containing BT, DBT, 4-MDBT and 4,6-DMDBT, using H2O2 (0.26 mmol) as oxidant and a temperature of 70 °C. Initially, the influence of different reaction media based on a variety of solvents with different extraction capacities, such as acetonitrile (MeCN), an ionic liquid ([BMIM]PF6) and a deep eutectic solvent (TBA/PEG) were investigated (Fig. 1 ). It is important to note that when an extraction solvent was present, the Venturello-based catalysts were dissolved in this medium; however, in case of absence of extraction solvent, catalysts behaved as heterogeneous catalysts, without any dissolution in the model diesel medium. The initial extraction performance followed the order MeCN > TBA/PEG > [BMIM]PF6 (Fig. 1). The highest extraction capacity verified for MeCN and for TBA/PEG solvents may be related with their low viscosity and high solubility of the sulfur compounds in these solvents, when compared with the ionic liquid [BMIM]PF6. After the addition of H2O2 oxidant, the oxidative catalytic stage of ECODS process is initiated and the oxidation of the sulfur compounds occurred probably only in the extraction phase, since no oxidized products were detected in the model diesel phase. In this catalytic stage, a different desulfurization efficiency was observed using the peroxo catalysts. Using (Bu4N)3PW4, the model diesel/[BMIM]PF6 system revealed to promote the highest desulfurization efficiency (100 % after 40 min). Using the same extraction solvent, only 62 % of desulfurization was achieved after 40 min, using (Bu4N)3PMo4 catalyst. Also using this catalyst, similar desulfurization was found with TBA/PEG solvent and lower efficiency using MeCN. For longer reaction time, the desulfurization efficiency catalyzed by (Bu4N)3PMo4 only increased from 62 %, obtained after 40 min, to 74 %, after 2 h, using TBA/PEG solvent. With MeCN and [BMIM]PF6 the desulfurization efficiency did not increase (Fig. 1). This peroxomolybdenum compound has been studied previously under a solvent-free system. In this case, complete desulfurization of model diesel was achieved after 3 h, but using twice more catalyst than used in this work. [56] Comparing the catalytic efficiency between peroxomolybdate and peroxotungstate compounds, the most efficient ECODS system was using (Bu4N)3PW4 catalyst and [BMIM]PF6 as extraction solvent. Regarding both catalysts, the best performance observed for the tungsten-containing catalyst can be related with a stronger acidic site and tunable acidity when compared with its homologous (Bu4N)3PMo4. [56] The high efficiency of the ionic liquid [BMIM]PF6 for ECODS process was already refereed in previous works as a result of the water-immiscibility property of [BMIM]PF6 that promotes the formation of a triphasic system (model diesel/H2O2/[BMIM]PF6) that probably avoids catalyst deactivation and non-effective oxidant decomposition [41,57–59]. Fig. 1 also presents the results obtained when no extraction solvent was used and under this condition, lower sulfur conversion than 26 % in the presence of both Venturello catalysts were obtained after 40 min of reaction. Using the system (Bu4N)3PW4/[BMIM]PF6, the reactivity of the sulfur compounds present in model diesel was analyzed, and the sequence of activity in sulfur oxidation showed to be similar for DBT, 4-MDBT and BT, and slightly less effective for 4,6-DMDBT (Fig. 2 ). In fact, the electron density of sulfur atom and steric hindrance effects of 4,6-DMDBT is higher than the other sulfur compounds. [35,40,54] It is acceptable that sulfur compounds with high electron density on S atom should be easily coordinated to the oxygen transferred from the active specie, also the steric hindrance of the two alkyl groups has a larger negative effect on sulfur oxidation, and therefore, interfering on the desulfurization performance. 3.2 Optimization studies The system that revealed highest desulfurization efficiency, i.e. ((Bu4N)3PW4/[BMIM]PF6, was selected to study the optimization of some parameters from ECODS system. This study intends to conciliate efficiency and sustainability of the process. The parameters studied were: the catalyst amount (0.3–5 μmol), the oxidant amount (0.06–0.5 mmol) and the volume ratio between model diesel and extraction solvent (1:1, 1:0.5, 1:0.25 and 1:0.15). Industrially, the achievement of high desulfurization efficiency using low amounts of catalyst is an important parameter, allowing to minimize the costs associated to the catalyst production. Therefore, different amounts of (Bu4N)3PW4 were tested in the presence of 0.26 mmol of H2O2 and equal volumes of model diesel and the solvent [BMIM]PF6. The desulfurization results are summarized in Fig. 3 . In general, the increase of (Bu4N)3PW4 amount promoted an increase on desulfurization efficiency, obtaining practically complete desulfurization after 40 min using 2.5 μmol (99.4 %) and 5 μmol (99.7 %) amounts. In fact, the desulfurization profile obtained with these two last amounts of catalyst resulted in a similar efficiency. Therefore, increasing the catalyst amount higher than 2.5 μmol did not improve desulfurization efficiency. Other parameter that can have a remarkable influence in ECODS performance is the H2O2 amount, since this can have a key impact during the evolution of the oxidative catalytic stage. although the catalyst is a peroxo containing in its structure active oxygen atoms capable to the transferred to the sulfur compounds, this need to be regenerated after oxidative reaction by the H2O2 oxidant and its concentration present in reaction can has an important influence in catalyst efficiency. Therefore, different amounts of oxidant were used, i.e. 0.063, 0.13, 0.26 and 0.52 mmol, maintaining the other reactional parameters. Results are presented in Fig. 4 and it is possible to observe that desulfurization efficiency increased when oxidant amount was increased. Using amounts from 0.063 mmol to 0.16 mmol of H2O2, no complete desulfurization was achieved, even after 3 h of reaction. In fact, under these last conditions, the desulfurization efficiency was not improved after the first hour, what indicate that the amount of oxidant presented was not enough to regenerate and reactivate the catalyst. On the other hand, using 0.26 and 0.52 mmol of oxidant, similar desulfurization conditions were obtained with practically complete desulfurization (99.4 %) obtained after 40 min. For last, it was also analyzed the volume ratio between model diesel/extraction solvent ([BMIM]PF6). Ionic liquids cannot be considered cost-effective solvents, therefore, the use of smallest amounts turn the ECODS process more sustainable and with higher economic viability. Thus, to optimize this parameter, the desulfurization of the model diesel was performed using different volumes of [BMIM]PF6 (0.75, 0.37, 0.18 and 0.11 mL). Results are presented in Fig. 5 and it is possible to observe that the main differences of desulfurization efficiency are observed during the first 30 min of the process, i.e. the initial extraction process and the first 20 min of oxidative catalytic stage. Higher ratio volume of extraction solvent has a positive impact in the initial extraction, since more sulfur compounds were transferred from the model diesel to [BMIM]PF6 phase when its volume is increased. Using volume ratio of 1:0.15, complete desulfurization was not achieved even after 2 h. This was probably due to the lower volume of the extraction solvent present in the ECODS system. However, when this last was increased to 1: 0.25, complete desulfurization was obtained after 40 min and the efficiency of the ECODS system was not improved by increasing the [BMIM]PF6 phase. 3.3 Reusability of ECODS system The reusability of the homogeneous (Bu4N)3PW4 dissolved in [BMIM]PF6 was tested for several ECODS cycles using the optimized conditions: T =70 °C, n((Bu4N)3PW4) =2.5 μmol, n(H2O2) =0.26 mmol, ratio model diesel/IL 1:1, 1:0.5 and 1:0.25. After each cycle, the treated model diesel phase was removed from the reactor vessel, and fresh portions of sulfurized model diesel (0.75 mL) and H2O2 (0.26 mmol) were added to initiate a new ECODS cycle. Consecutive ECODS cycles were carried out using different ratio model diesel/[BMIM]PF6 and the desulfurization results are present in Fig. 6 . Observing the three consecutive ECODS cycles, it is clear the occurrence of an inverse behavior between the efficiency of the (Bu4N)3PW4/[BMIM]PF6 catalytic system and the volume of the extraction solvent. Under the highest volume of [BMIM]PF6 (1:1), the catalytic desulfurization efficiency decreased from 98 % to 86 % (2nd cycle) and 61 % (3rd cycle). Interestingly, different profiles were observed for 1:0.25 and 1:0.5 ratio of model diesel/[BMIM]PF6, from which no substantial loss of catalytic efficiency was detected in consecutive ECODS cycles. However, under these conditions a precipitation of white sulfones could be observed in the [BMIM]PF6 phase, as a result of the faster saturation of the extraction phase. Analyzing Fig. 7 , the vital role of H2O2 is highlighted, since the oxidant allows the continuous catalytic cycles, through the re-activation of the active catalytic specie (PW4) responsible for the oxidative process from sulfide to sulfoxide and from this to sulfone (the sulfoxide perform a second nucleophilic attack over one peroxo ligand). The lower volume of ionic liquid contains a higher concentration of the homogeneous catalyst and this seems to have a positive impact on desulfurization reaction progress, suggesting that the re-activation of the catalyst by its interaction with the H2O2 appears to be faster and easy, contributing at the same time for the economic-viability of the ECODS process. In Fig. 8 was analyzed the impact of the volume ratio 1:0.5 (model diesel/[BMIM]PF6) for six consecutive cycles. After the 3rd reused cycle was clear a decrease on desulfurization efficiency as a possible result of the saturation of the [BMIM]PF6 phase with white solid sulfones or deactivation of the peroxotungstate catalyst (Bu4N)3PW4 dissolved in the ionic liquid phase. To understand the reason of this decrease of efficiency, the white solid present in the IL phase was removed by centrifugation after the 2nd desulfurization reusing cycle. Fig. 8 compares the desulfurization efficiency of six consecutive reusing cycles, removing or not removing the white solid formed after each cycle. The decrease of desulfurization efficiency of the ECODS system is eliminated by removing the white solid sulfones between cycles (desulfurization efficiency of the first cycle was 87 % and the sixth was 89 % after 40 min). Furthermore, the loss of [BMIM]PF6 phase caused by the cleaning treatment between cycles was evaluated and after six reused cycles only 4% of volume was loss. Therefore, these results indicated that the catalyst did not suffer a deactivation and also this is well dissolved and entrapped in the [BMIM]PF6 phase. 3.4 Stability of (Bu4N)3PW4 catalyst The stability of the (Bu4N)3PW4 catalyst was analyzed after the sixth cycle by 31P NMR (Fig. 9 ). The 31P NMR spectrum of CD3CN solution of (Bu4N)3PW4 presents a single peak at 4.57 ppm, which is in agreement with the literature [13]. After the sixth ECODS cycle, this peak is shifted to 3.1 ppm, which indicates a slight structural modification of the Venturello compound caused by its reactivation (Fig. 7). Furthermore, two new resonance peaks can be observed at -1.7 and -7.3 ppm, that may result from a Venturello structural modification in other peroxophosphotungstate species [13]. 3.5 Comparison with reported data The Venturello compound ((Bu4N)3PW4 have been immobilized previously in a functionalized SBA-15 and also incorporated into MIL-101(Cr) framework. Using the first catalyst, acetonitrile was used instead of the [BMIM]PF6 ionic liquid with a ratio of model diesel/acetonitrile of 1:1. Similar catalytic efficiency was found using Venturello compound ((Bu4N)3PW4 and when immobilized into functionalized SBA-15 support, i.e. practically complete desulfurization was achieved after 2 h. [35] More recently, the ((Bu4N)3PW4 immobilized into MIL-101(Cr) support was already studied using [BMIM]PF6 recyclable solvent and in this case similar results were found with practically complete desulfurization of model diesel after 40 min. [25] The present manuscript compromises an optimization study that resulted in a more sustainable and cost-effective process, since half or a quarter of the amount of the ionic liquid was needed and used continuously for six ECODS cycles without losing apparent desulfurization efficiency. 4 Conclusions Venturello-based complexes ((Bu4N)3PW4 and (Bu4N)3PMo4 were used as catalysts for the desulfurization of a multicomponent model diesel (BT, DBT, 4,6-DMDBT). The peroxotungstate presented to be more active catalyst than the peroxomolybdate, achieving practically complete desulfurization after less reaction time and using less amount of [BMIM]PF6. An optimization study was performed and the parameters as oxidant, catalyst and solvent amounts and solvent nature were analyzed. Conciliating efficiency and sustainability resulted in an eco-sustainable system, that uses 2.5 μmol of catalyst, 0.26 mmol of H2O2 and a ratio of 1:0.25 to model diesel/[BMIM]PF6. Under these conditions near complete desulfurization (99.4 %) of the multicomponent model diesel was achieved after only 40 min of reaction. The stability study performed to the peroxotungstate compound after catalytic use indicate some structural modification. This result suggests that Venturello peroxocompound may not be the active catalytic center when dissolved in the ionic liquid phase. However, its reusability for six ECODS cycles was achieved without loss of efficiency when the precipitated white sulfones were removed from the system, allowing the reusability of the catalyst and the IL solvent. Therefore, a compromise between efficiency, sustainability and cost-effectivity was enhanced in this work and in the near future the optimized system will be tested using real fuels as diesel and jet fuel.

        "dc:description": "The creation of more sustainable and high efficient desulfurization system, capable to operate under cost-effective conditions, led to the application of peroxopolyoxometalates as active oxidative catalysts. These compounds present active peroxo groups in their structure that promote easily the oxidation of sulfur compounds in the presence of low amounts of oxidant (H2O2/S = 4). The sustainability of the desulfurization of a multicomponent model diesel (2000 ppm S) was increased by the optimization of various parameters, such as nature and volume of extraction solvent, oxidant and catalyst. The Venturello peroxotungstate ((Bu4N)3PW4) showed to be a catalyst able to complete desulfurize a model diesel (after only 40 min), under lower amounts of solvent, oxidant and catalyst, than the analogues peroxomolybdate ((Bu4N)3PMo4) compound. Furthermore, the (Bu4N)3PW4/[BMIM]PF6 system was able to be reused for six consecutive desulfurization cycles maintaining its efficiency. The oxidized sulfur compounds were removed from [BMIM]PF6 phase in the end of each catalytic cycle. This simple procedure guarantees the cost-efficiency of the process, promoting the reuse of the catalyst and the solvent for various consecutive cycles, without the need of heterogenization techniques.",
