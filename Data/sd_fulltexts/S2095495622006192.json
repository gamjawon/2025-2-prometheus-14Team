Graphical abstract The electrons redistribution at the homogenous interface of a/c-MoO2 can enable high Na adsorbability and low Na diffusion energy barrier to enhance the electron/charge transfer kinetics for boosted Na+ storage. High-efficiency sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are in great demand for energy storage applications, which are dominated by the Na+ storage performance of electrode materials. Here, a one-pot solvothermal method is developed to construct amorphous/crystalline MoO2 (a/c-MoO2) homojunction for boosting Na+ storage. Theoretical simulations signify that electrons redistribute at the homogenous interface of a/c-MoO2, resulting in an inbuilt driving force to easily adsorb charge carriers and promote the electron/ion transfer ability. Relying on its crystallographic superiorities, the a/c-MoO2 homojunction with high Na adsorbability (−1.61 eV) and low Na diffusion energy barrier (0.519 eV) achieves higher capacity (307 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A/g), better rate capability and cycling stability than either a-MoO2 or c-MoO2 counterpart. Combining in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques, the ‘adsorption–insertion–conversion’ mechanism is well established for Na+ storage of MoO2. Our work opens new opportunities to optimize electrode materials via crystallographic engineering for efficient Na+ storage, and helps to better understand the effects of homojunction structure in enhanced electrochemical performance. Keywords MoO2 homojunction Crystallographic engineering Theoretical calculations In-situ XRD Na+ storage mechanism 1 Introduction Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely commercialized due to their high capacity and long cycling life [1,2]. Nevertheless, the limited lithium and cobalt resources result in the high cost of LIBs and hinder their further large-scale applications [3,4]. As a promising alternative, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are highly desirable to meet the ever-growing demand of grid-scale energy storage systems, owing to the natural abundance of Na resource and its analogous physicochemical nature with Li [5–7]. However, the SIBs always deliver lower energy density than LIBs, due to the larger atomic weight and radius of Na+ than Li+. Such intrinsic characteristics cause the sluggish sodiation/desodiation of electrode materials. Therefore, it is essential and urgent to seek appropriate electrode materials for advancing SIBs technology. Recently, great efforts have been devoted to developing various anode materials for SIBs. In particular, transition metal oxides have been considered as ideal candidates because of their promising theoretical specific capacity [8]. Among them, molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) with metallic nature exhibits intrinsic advantages for Na+ storage, such as high theoretical capacity, low cost, and relatively high electronic conductivity (200 S cm−1) [9,10]. On the other hand, MoO2 still suffers from sluggish kinetics and large volume change during (de)sodiation processes, which is detrimental to its reversible capacity and cycling durability [11]. Encouragingly, several effective strategies have been explored to optimize the anode materials with improved electrochemical performance, such as nanoarchitecture design [12], morphology optimization [13], defect/interface engineering [14–20], and buffer coating [21–26]. Among the above strategies, hetero-phase construction has emerged as a powerful pathway to regulate the local structure and surface chemistry of nanomaterials, endowing them with desired electrochemical performance [27–33]. Nevertheless, the current interfacial engineering strategies to construct heterostructures usually contain multi-steps and long-time high-temperature annealing processes, which are over tedious and time/energy-consuming. In view of that, it is significant to explore simple one-pot and low-cost routes for the precise synthesis of heterostructures. Moreover, there are rare reports addressing the intrinsic effects of homojunction structure in Na+ storage characteristics of electrode materials. Therefore, further efforts are still needed for a more comprehensive understanding. Herein, a facile one-pot solvothermal method was proposed to prepare MoO2 nanoclusters via the decomposition of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O under ethanol-induced reduction. The crystallinity modulation was achieved by readily varying the volume ratio of reaction medium, without any post-treatments or high temperature processing. It was evident that the homogenous interface and structural defects were in-situ introduced in the a/c-MoO2 homojunction, which can regulate its electronic structure and induce an unbalanced charge distribution, providing an inbuilt driving force to facilitate the electron/charge transport. Theoretical calculations indicated that the a/c-MoO2 takes the respective advantages of high Na adsorbability from amorphous counterpart and high Na diffusivity from crystalline counterpart. Such intriguing feature would be energetically favorable to bind and transfer Na+ ions simultaneously, enabling fast Na+ storage. Additionally, the structural defects can provide voids for extra Na+ uptake and alleviate volume variation as buffer zone in the (de)sodiation processes. Relying on these crystallographic merits, the a/c-MoO2 homojunction achieved a higher Na+ storage capacity (307 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1) with superior rate capability (132 mA h g−1 at 2.5 A g−1) and cycling stability than either a-MoO2 or c-MoO2. Moreover, the combined in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical analyses revealed the ‘adsorption–insertion–conversion’ mechanism for the Na+ storage of MoO2 with good structural reversibility. Our findings help to better understand the effects of homojunction structure in enhanced electrochemical performance, and provide a promising crystallographic engineering strategy to optimize electrode materials for efficient Na+ storage. 2 Experimental 2.1 One-pot solvothermal synthesis of a-MoO2, a/c-MoO2, and c-MoO2 Firstly, 100 mg of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) was dispersed into the mixed solution of deionized water and ethanol under stirring for 10 min. Next, 1 mL HNO3 also was dropped into the above mixed solution under stirring for 10 min at room temperature. Then, the mixture was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 12 h. Finally, the products were collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water and ethanol for several times, and dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. The volume ratio of deionized water and ethanol was varied from 1:1, 2:1, to 5:1, and the obtained samples were denoted as a-MoO2, a/c-MoO2, and c-MoO2, respectively. 2.2 In-situ XRD measurements The operando electrochemical cell with a Be foil window to transmit X-rays was provided by the Beijing Scistar Technology Co., ltd. The electrode fabrication process was the same as that in the Supplementary Material and the mass loading of active material was around 5.0 mg cm−2. The current collector was Al foil. The in situ cell was charged/discharged in 0.01–3.0 V (vs Na/Na+) at a constant current density of 0.1 A g−1, meanwhile, in situ XRD patterns were collected in real time during the discharge–charge processes on a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer. The scanning rate was 5° min−1. 2.3 Ex-situ XPS measurements Firstly, the MoO2-based half-cells were discharged/charged at 0.1 A g−1 and stopped at specific potentials for 15 min. Then, the cells were disassembled in a high-purity Ar-filled glovebox. The electrodes were washed with glycol dimethyl ether (DME) for several times and dried in vacuum. Finally, the electrodes at different discharged/charged states were tested on a ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). 2.4 Theoretical calculations The geometrical optimization process for obtaining the equilibrium structure of a/c-MoO2 was performed by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation, mainly consisting of the following steps: (i) the original structure MoO2 was first constructed based on the its monoclinic type with space group P21/c (JCPDS No. 78–1071). Initial structure is the 2 × 2 × 5 supercells including 160 O and 80 Mo atoms. (ii) AIMD simulation was then adopted to increase the temperature to obtain the a/c-MoO2. A 7650-step AIMD simulation with a time step of 1 fs was performed in NVT ensemble at 1800 K, which is higher than the melting point of the MoO2 crystal. Half of the atoms along the x-axis were fixed while the rest were fully relaxed. (iii) Annealing was lastly conducted at 0 K for the a/c homojunction structure obtained from previous step. This yields the final equilibrium structure of a/c-MoO2, which is subjected to further DFT relaxation. Details of characterizations, electrochemical measurements, and computational methods, were given in the Electronic Supplementary Material. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural and morphological features The crystallinity of the MoO2 samples can be readily modulated by varying the volume ratio of deionized water to anhydrous ethanol, and experimental details are presented in Electronic Supplementary Material. In general, the increase of water content can continuously reinforce the polarity degree of the reaction medium and the hydrolysis of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, which would favor the crystallographic growth of MoO2. As a consequence, the amorphous MoO2 (a-MoO2), amorphous/crystalline MoO2 (a/c-MoO2), and crystalline MoO2 (c-MoO2) were successfully generated in the mixed water/ethanol medium with low (1:1), moderate (2:1), and high (5:1) volume ratio, respectively. As evidenced by the XRD patterns (Fig. 1 a), the sharp and strong diffraction peaks of c-MoO2 indicate its high crystallinity, and meanwhile, the broadened and weakened peaks confirm the less-crystalline feature of a/c-MoO2 containing the crystalline and amorphous hetero-phase. All the characteristic diffraction peaks of the c-MoO2 and a/c-MoO2 can be well assigned to monoclinic MoO2 with a space group of P21/c (JCPDS No. 78–1071). By comparison, there is no obvious diffraction peak for a-MoO2, indicating its amorphous phase. The composition and purity of the a-MoO2 sample were further evaluated by the XPS. The XPS survey spectrum (Fig. S1) indicates the existence of only Mo and O elements with the atomic ratio of 1:2.1, which is in accordance with the stoichiometric ratio of MoO2. The Mo 3d core-level spectrum (Fig. 1b) consists of a spin–orbit doublet at 233.9 and 230.8 eV, attributing to Mo 3d 3/2 and Mo 3d 5/2 of Mo (IV). The O 1s core-level spectrum (Fig. 1c) can be deconvoluted into two peaks, where the main peak at 530.8 eV belongs to O-Mo bonds and the satellite peak at 532.7 eV is evidence of defective sites [15]. The morphology of the MoO2 samples is visualized by electron microscopy. As observed in Fig. S2, the MoO2 samples are nanoclusters composed of much smaller nanoparticles (about 5 nm). The corresponding HRTEM (high-resolution transmission electron microscope) images further identify their crystallinity and microstructure. Compared with the a-MoO2 with typical amorphous feature (Fig. 1d) and c-MoO2 with highly crystalline feature (Fig. 1f), it is apparent that the a/c-MoO2 nanoclusters show a homogenous interface with the co-existence of amorphous (circled by yellow dashed line in Fig. 1e) and crystalline (distinct lattice fringes in Fig. 1e) domains, along with numerous structural defects. The HRTEM results hold good consistence with the XRD results, demonstrating the successful crystallinity modulation of the MoO2 samples. The well-constructed a/c-MoO2 homojunction is expected to synergize the benefits from different phases for boosting Na+ storage. 3.2 Theoretical calculations and kinetics analyses Theoretical calculations were first performed to illustrate the influence of homojunction structure on the electronic states of MoO2 and further affecting its Na+ storage characteristics at the atomic level. The geometrical optimization was conducted by ab initio molecular dynamic simulation (AIMD). After a 7650-step AIMD simulation at 1800 K (Fig. S3) with subsequent annealing at 0 K, the structure of amorphous counterpart tends to be thermodynamically stable. The optimized structural model is shown in Fig. 2 (a), signifying that the amorphous structure presents atomic rearrangements and becomes disordered. Compared to its initial structure, both the Mo–O bond lengths and corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles have changes after the geometrical optimization. The deformed structure of MoO2 may induce lattice defects and distort its local electron distribution to a certain extent, which was computationally examined by density function theory (DFT) calculations. As visualized by the electron localization function (Fig. 2b), it is apparent that electrons redistribute at the homogenous interface of a/c-MoO2, resulting in an inbuilt driving force to easily adsorb charge carriers and promote the electron/ion transfer ability [34,35]. The enhanced Na ions adsorbability originating from the disproportionate electron distribution is then identified. Fig. 2(c) shows the most favorable Na adsorption positions on the (020) surface of c-MoO2 (left), a/c-MoO2 (middle), and a-MoO2 (right), and their corresponding adsorption energies (E ads) are calculated to be −1.59, −1.61, and −1.63 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the Na diffusion pathways and energy barriers along the (020) surface of MoO2 are depicted in Fig. S4 and Fig. 2(d–f). The Na diffusion energy barriers (E d) are 0.504 eV for c-MoO2, 0.519 eV for a/c-MoO2, and 0.553 eV for a-MoO2. The higher E ads may result in a faster Na+ transfer kinetics from electrolyte to electrode, while the lower E d benefits better Na+ diffusivity in the electrode. Our theoretical findings suggest that the a/c-MoO2 homojunction takes the respective advantages of high Na adsorbability from amorphous counterpart and high Na diffusivity from crystalline counterpart. Such intriguing feature would be energetically favorable to bind and transfer Na+ ions simultaneously, enabling fast Na+ storage. The enhanced electron/ion transfer kinetics of the a/c-MoO2 homojunction is further validated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). Fig. 3 (a) presents the Nyquist plots with the fitted impedance data (solid lines) of the MoO2 electrodes, while the equivalent electrical circuit models are provided in Fig. S5. Interestingly, either a-MoO2 or c-MoO2 has only one depressed semicircle at the high frequency, whereas the a/c-MoO2 possesses two depressed semicircles, arising from the Na+ migration resistance through the hetero-phase boundaries (R 1) and charge transfer resistance (R ct) between the electrode–electrolyte, respectively [20,36]. By deriving from the fitted data (Table S1), the a/c-MoO2 exhibits lower R ct (372.1 Ω) than the a-MoO2 (405.9 Ω) and c-MoO2 (526.3 Ω). Moreover, the sloping line at the low frequency represents the Warburg impedance (Z W) of Na+ ions diffusion into the active materials. From the potting of Z′ versus ω −1/2 (Fig. 3b), the Warburg factor (σ) is estimated to be 78.9, 184.0 and 215.6 ohm s−1/2 for the a/c-MoO2, a-MoO2, and c-MoO2, respectively. The smaller σ, the higher Na+ diffusion coefficient (D Na+). Fig. S6 shows the GITT results of the electrodes, in which the potential change during each relaxation period represents overpotential at the corresponding sodiation stage. It is obvious that the a/c-MoO2 possesses smaller overpotentials than a-MoO2 and c-MoO2 during the whole potential range, implying its better kinetic behavior [37]. The calculated D Na+ (Fig. 3c) from GITT results also suggest that the a/c-MoO2 exhibits higher D Na+ than a-MoO2 and c-MoO2. The theoretical and kinetics results reveal that the homojunction structure is favorable for rapid electron/charge transfer, enabling the a/c-MoO2 to achieve superior Na+ storage performance. 3.3 Electrochemical Na+ storage behavior and mechanism The electrochemical Na+ storage behavior of the MoO2 electrodes was systematically evaluated by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic discharge–charge (GCD) tests. Fig. S7 displays the initial three CV cycles at 0.1 mV s−1 and GCD profiles at 0.1 A g−1 of the MoO2 with different crystallinities, suggesting all of them exhibit similar Na+ storage behavior. It is noted that the irreversible reduction peak at 1.2 V in the first cathodic scan is associated with the irreversible platform in the first discharge profile, originating from the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) [24]. In the anodic scans, two reversible oxidation peaks at 0.45 and 0.70 V are ascribed to the oxidation reactions from Mo to Na x MoO2 and further to MoO2 during the desodiation process [13,14]. Fig. 4 (a) shows the integrated CV plots at 0.25 mV s−1 of all the MoO2 electrodes, which can provide direct information on their different amounts of charge transferred during the electrochemical reaction. It is obvious that the a/c-MoO2 homojunction exhibits better electrochemical activity and higher Na+ storage capacity than either a-MoO2 or c-MoO2, which is further quantified in Fig. 4(b and c). The reversible discharge profiles at 0.25 A g−1 (Fig. 4b) intuitively prove that a/c-MoO2 exhibits higher Na+ storage capacity (252.9 mA h g−1) than a-MoO2 (191.2 mA h g−1) and c-MoO2 (156.9 mA h g−1). More notably, in view of the gradient changes of the CV plots and discharge profiles in different potential regions, the sodiation process can be divided into three different stages. The flat CV curves associated with the dramatically declined discharge profiles (black segments in the magnified diagram, inset of Fig. 4b, Stage I) at high potential arise from the electrostatic adsorption of Na+ ions on the surface of MoO2. Stage II refers to the Na+ ions insertion into MoO2 lattice and structural defects (MoO2 + xNa+ + xe− ↔Na x MoO2) [33], giving rise to the broad CV humps and the sloping discharge profiles (red segments in Fig. 4b) in the middle potential region. The strong current response in the low potential region (Fig. 4a) along with the slight plateaus (blue segments in Fig. 4b) are probably caused by partial conversion reaction of Na x MoO2 + (4–x)Na+ + (4–x)e− ↔ Mo + 2Na2O (Stage III) [13,14]. Notably, the calculated D Na+ as a function of (de)sodiation states (Fig. 3c) also well support such hypothesis of three different Na+ storage stages. It is evident that the D Na+ is high in the initial stage, then decreases gradually in the middle potential region (associated with the sloping region of potentiogram), and drops steeply (labeled by green square in Fig. 3c) in the low potential region (associated with the plateau region of potentiogram). The gradual decrease of D Na+ is reasonable as the surface sites are easily accessible to bind with Na+ ions and the Na+ ions have to overcome a repulsive charge gradient from the previously bound Na+ ions during the progressive sodiation [38]. The conversion reaction (stage III) is responsible for the steep drop, due to its much slower kinetics than the adsorption (stage I) and insertion (stage II). The respective potential ranges and capacity contributions of three different Na+ storage stages are summarized in Table S2. Conspicuously, there are three distinctive phenomena worth highlighting. First, the MoO2 with different crystallinities possess different cutoff potentials for electrostatic Na+ adsorption, that is, 2.5 V for a/c-MoO2 in comparison to 2.3 V for a-MoO2 and 2.1 V for c-MoO2. Second, the a/c-MoO2 has a higher cutoff potential (0.3 V) for Na+ insertion than the a-MoO2 and c-MoO2 (0.2 V). It is reasonable as the a/c-MoO2 takes the advantages of high Na adsorbability from amorphous counterpart and high Na diffusivity from crystalline counterpart, which would be more energetically favorable to bind and transfer Na+ ions simultaneously, thus allowing the sodiation to occur at higher potentials versus Na/Na+. Third, the a/c-MoO2 exhibits higher Na+ insertion capacity (179.2 mA h g−1, the dominant contribution of 70.8 % to total capacity) than either a-MoO2 (130.8 mA h g−1) or c-MoO2 (112.6 mA h g−1). It is mainly due to that the electrons redistribution at the homogenous interface of a/c-MoO2 can provide an inbuilt driving force to enable more Na+ ions insertion, meanwhile, its structural defects can accommodate more Na+ ions uptake [32–34]. Besides, the structural defects can serve as buffer zone to effectively alleviate volume change during the (de)sodiation processes. On account of its crystallographic merits, the a/c-MoO2 homojunction exhibits much better Na+ storage properties than a-MoO2 and c-MoO2. As presented in Fig. 4(c), the a/c-MoO2 electrode achieves high specific capacities of 307, 253, 214, 177, and 132 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 A g−1, respectively. By contrast, either a-MoO2 or c-MoO2 shows a much lower capacity and poorer rate capability with 43 or 38 mA h g−1 at 2.5 A g−1. Moreover, the long-term cycling tests at 1.0 A g−1 indicate that the a/c-MoO2 still maintains 86 % reversible capacity over 3000 cycles, which is much higher than the a-MoO2 (68 %) and c-MoO2 (42 %). In addition, the EIS measurements at different cycles for a/c-MoO2 electrode were conducted. As displayed in Fig. S8, the impedance curves obtained at 1st, 50th and 100th cycles were almost constant, indicating the stability of the electrode–electrolyte interface during cycling. In-situ XRD technique is performed to probe the real-time structural evolution and Na+ storage mechanism of the MoO2. From the full-scale in situ XRD patterns (Fig. S9), only the (020) peak of the MoO2 shows an obvious shift, revealing the Na+ insertion into MoO2 mainly through its (020) plane. The contour plot of (020) peak evolution (Fig. 5 a) and the specific d (020)-spacing change (Fig. 5b) provide much clearer observation on the structural evolution of the MoO2 electrode during the discharge–charge processes. Upon discharging, the (020) peak gradually shifts towards lower angles with the d (020)-spacing expansion from 2.453 to 2.514 Å, due to the continuous Na+ ions insertion. In reverse, the (020) peak returns back to its initial position upon charging (Na+ ions extraction), suggesting the high structural reversibility of MoO2. Interestingly, one feature in Fig. 5(a) should be highlighted that the (020) peak has no observable shift when the potential is lower than 0.3 V, but there is still a capacity contribution below 0.3 V from the GCD profile view. It is probably contributed by the partial conversion reaction of MoO2. However, neither Mo metal nor Na2O related to the conversion reaction of MoO2 is detected by in-situ XRD, even after full sodiation (discharged to 0.01 V). The possible reasons are that (i) the intensity of interfering peaks (such as Be and Al) is too high to conceal the distinct signal of Mo and Na2O, and (ii) the sizes of metallic Mo and Na2O nanoparticles are presumably smaller than the X-ray coherence length [39]. In order to verify the abovementioned hypothesis, ex-situ XPS is further adopted for a more specific view. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the Mo 3d core level spectrum of the fully sodiated MoO2 (discharged to 0.01 V) consists of two spin–orbit doublets. One doublet at 229.5/232.6 eV (3d 5/2/3d 3/2) is associated with Mo − O of the Na x MoO2. Notably, this Mo 3d binding energy is lower than that emitted from the pristine MoO2 (230.8/233.9 eV), which is the result of the decreased Mo valence upon reduction via Na+ insertion reaction (MoO2 + xNa+ + xe− ↔ Na x MoO2, Stage II). The other doublet at 227.8/230.9 eV is convincing evidence of the Mo metal formation via the conversion reaction (Stage III). Besides, the simultaneously generated Na2O is also identified by the Na–O peak at 1072.6 eV in the Na 1s core level spectrum acquired after full sodiation (0.01 V, Fig. 5d). The main peak at 1071.1 eV belongs to the Na2CO3 species formed by electrolyte decomposition. Upon full desodiation (charged to 3.0 V, Fig. 5(c and d)), the Mo–O peak is restored back to that of Mo(IV) oxide, meanwhile, the peaks corresponding to metallic Mo and Na–O are absent, manifesting the good insertion/conversion reaction reversibility of the MoO2. In brief, the ‘adsorption–insertion–conversion’ mechanism is well established for the Na+ storage of MoO2 by the combination of in-situ XRD, ex-situ XPS, and electrochemical analyses, as schematically illustrated in the inset of Fig. 4(b). 4 Conclusions To summarize, the crystallinity modulation on MoO2 nanoclusters has been realized by readily varying the volume ratio of reaction medium. Theoretical study helps to better understand the effects of homojunction structure in boosted Na+ storage of MoO2. The electrons redistribution at the homogenous interface of a/c-MoO2 homojunction can induce an inbuilt driving force to enable high Na adsorbability and low Na diffusion energy barrier, thus signaficantly facilitating the electron/ion transfer kinetics. Moreover, the structural defects can provide extra Na+ uptake sites and also accommodate volume expansion as buffer zone during the (de)sodiation processes. Benefiting from these superiorities, the a/c-MoO2 homojunction achieved higher Na+ storage capacity, better rate capability and cycling stability than either a-MoO2 or c-MoO2 counterpart. The combination of electrochemical kinetic analyses with in-situ and ex-situ techniques collectively demonstrates the ‘adsorption–insertion–conversion’ Na+ storage mechanism of MoO2. Our work provides new opportunities to optimize electrode materials via crystallographic engineering for efficient Na+ storage. This feasible approach can be applicable to prepare other homojunctions for promising catalysis, energy conversion and storage applications.

        "dc:description": "High-efficiency sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are in great demand for energy storage applications, which are dominated by the Na+ storage performance of electrode materials. Here, a one-pot solvothermal method is developed to construct amorphous/crystalline MoO2 (a/c-MoO2) homojunction for boosting Na+ storage. Theoretical simulations signify that electrons redistribute at the homogenous interface of a/c-MoO2, resulting in an inbuilt driving force to easily adsorb charge carriers and promote the electron/ion transfer ability. Relying on its crystallographic superiorities, the a/c-MoO2 homojunction with high Na adsorbability (−1.61 eV) and low Na diffusion energy barrier (0.519 eV) achieves higher capacity (307 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A/g), better rate capability and cycling stability than either a-MoO2 or c-MoO2 counterpart. Combining in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques, the ‘adsorption–insertion–conversion’ mechanism is well established for Na+ storage of MoO2. Our work opens new opportunities to optimize electrode materials via crystallographic engineering for efficient Na+ storage, and helps to better understand the effects of homojunction structure in enhanced electrochemical performance.",
