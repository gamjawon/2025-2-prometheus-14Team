Some of the sample were modified with 0.5 M HZS04 and used as modified catalysts. The addition of Ti02 to Si02 caused the increase of acidity and acid strength, and the shifts of O-H and Si-O stretching bands of silanol group to lower frequencies in proportion to the Ti02 content. Catalytic activities for 2-propanol dehydration and cumene dealkylation increased in relation to the increase of acidity and the band shifts to lower frequencies. The catalytic activities of modified catalysts were higher than those of unmodified catalysts, and the effect of modification on catalytic activity was higher for 2-propanol dehydration than for cumene dealkylation. The effect of modification on catalytic activity increased with increasing Ti02 content of the catalysts. Actually, 92-Ti02-SiOz/SOQ- had the highest increment in catalytic activity and 10-Ti02Si02/SO;- had the lowest increment for the 2-propanol dehydration.

Introduction Recently, many kinds of mixed oxides have been reported to show surface acidity. Metal oxide which is inactive or slightly active by itself induces a high catalytic activity by the addition of other oxide. Silica-alumina and silica-zirconia catalysts may be cited as an example of this phenomenon [ 1-7 ] . The activity of 2102-Si02 * Corresponding author. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

Sohn et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994)149-167 catalyst was directly proportional to the number of acid centers on the surface [ 8 ] . The combination of Ti02 and Si02 generates strong acid sites and a theory for the creation of acidic sites in Ti02-Si02 has been presented [ 9 ] . The properties of these coprecipitated Ti02-Si02 gels have also been reported [ 11-13 ] . Acid catalyzed reaction is correlated with acidity and acid strength. In cumene dealkylation the more acidic the catalysts, the higher catalytic activity they show [ 14,15 ] . On the other hand, tert-butanol dehydration takes place on relatively weaker acid sites, while skeletal isomerization of isobutylene requires exceedingly strong acid sites [ 16 ] . Thus to incorporate more acidity and stronger acid strength, single or binary oxide catalysts are modified with sulfuric acid [ 17-23 ] . The high catalytic activity of catalyst modified with sulfuric acid is attributed to the enhanced acidic property by the inductive effect of S=O bonds of the complex formed by the interaction of oxides with sulfate ion [ 22,24 ] . In this work, the physicochemical properties of a series Ti02-SiO2 catalysts prepared by coprecipitation method was investigated using X-ray diffraction, IR and XPS. The acidic properties of a series of Ti02-Si02 having various molar ratios of Ti02/SiO2 and their relationship to the activities for acid catalysis have been studied. Also the catalytic activities of Ti02-SiO2 modified with HZS04 are compared in detail with those of unmodified catalysts. For this purpose, the 2propanol dehydration and cumene dealkylation were used as test reactions. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst The coprecipitate of Ti (OH) 4-Si (OH) 4 was obtained by adding aqueous ammonia slowly into a mixed aqueous solution of titanium tetrachloride and sodium silicate solution at room temperature with stirring until the pH of the mother liquor reached 8. The ratio of titanium tetrachloride to sodium silicate was varied. The coprecipitate thus obtained was washed thoroughly with distilled water until chloride ions were not detected, and dried at 100 C. The dried coprecipitate was again washed with successive portions of a 5% ammonium nitrate solution and then with hot distilled water to remove sodium ion in the coprecipitate. The sample was powdered below 100 mesh and was used as catalyst after calcination at 350 C for 1.5 h. To obtain the modified catalysts 2 g of each dried precipitate was treated with each 30 ml of 0.5 M sulfuric acid followed by drying the sample in air as described elsewhere [ 22-25 ] . The dried solid powders were used as modified catalysts after calcination at 400 C for 1.5 h. All the catalysts prepared are tabulated in Table 1 together with their surface area. The catalysts are denoted by following a mole percentage of Ti02- That is, 92-Ti02-Si02 represents the catalysts having 92 mol% of Ti02 and 92-TiO2-SiO2/504- represents 92-Ti02-Si02 catalyst modified with 0.5 M H2S04. JA Sohn et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994)149-167 151 2.2. Procedure 2-Propanol dehydration was carried out at 180 C in a pulse microreactor connected to a gas chromatograph. Fresh catalyst in the reactor made of 1 /4 in. stainless steel was pretreated at 400 C for 1 h in the nitrogen atmosphere. Diethylene glycol succinate on Simalite was used as packing material for the gas chromatography and the column temperature was 150 C for analyzing the product. Catalytic activity for 2-propanol dehydration was represented as Amol of propylene converted from 2-propanol per surface area. Cumene dealkylation was carried out at 400 C in the same reactor as above. Packing material for the gas chromatography was Bentone 34 on Chromosorb W and column temperature was 130 C. Catalytic activity for cumene dealkylation was represented as jamol of benzene converted per surface area. Conversions for both reactions were taken as the average of the first to sixth pulse values. The acidity and acid strength of catalyst were measured quantitatively and qualitatively, respectively, using a series of the Hammett indicators. The catalyst in a glass tube was pretreated at 400 C for 1 h and the tube filled with dry nitrogen. For the determination of acid strength of the catalyst the color changes of the indicators were observed by spot test. Acidity was determined by the amount of n-butylamine which was dropped into the catalyst steeped in dry benzene until the color of indicator adsorbed on the catalyst disappeared. The sulfur content remaining on the catalyst after the calcination at 400 C for 1.5 h was determined by a thermal analyzer model PL-STA 1500 HF. The S03 content in the catalysts was estimated to be about 3-5 wt%. The specific surface area was determined by applying the BET method to the adsorption of nitrogen at -196 C. FTIR spectra were recorded using a Mattson model GL 6030E spectrometer. Usually 10 mg of catalyst was mixed with 100 mg of KBr and pressed into a disk (600 kg /cm2). For IR studies of OH stretching region (4000-3500 cm-'), self-supported disks of about 10 mg cm-2 were used. X-ray diffractograms of catalysts were taken by Rigaku model 2125D2 using copper target and nickel filter at 30 kV and 1000 cps. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed on Hitachi 507 photoelectron spectrometer equipped with cylindrical mirror analyzer using A1 anode (9 kV, 50 mA). Binding energy values were calculated in reference to the C1S level at 285.0 eV. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Surface area The surface areas of Ti02-SiO2 catalysts were checked by the BET method using nitrogen at -196 C. The results are listed in Table 1. The surface area increases gradually upon the addition of Si02 to Ti02. That is, the more silica content the 152 J.P.

This suggests that Si02 has more effect on the surface area than Ti02. However, the modified catalysts had a smaller surface area than the unmodified catalysts except for the catalyst having low content of Si02 such as 92-Ti02-Si02 and Ti02. Ti02/504- modified with H2S04 had about twice as large a surface area as pure Ti02, suggesting more difficult sintering (400 C, 1 h 30 min) of Ti02/504- in comparison with pure Ti02 as the case of Zr02[25]. 3.2. Infrared spectra of the catalysts A series of Ti02-Si02 calcined at 400 C was examined by IR absorption in the mid-infrared region, using the KBr disk technique. The spectra of bands around 1200-1100 cm-' due to Si-O skeletal stretching vibrations were sharper with increasing Ti02 content because of the higher degree of order [ 26] , indicating a different structure. The band of Si02 at 974 cm-' is assigned to the Si-O stretching vibration of the silanol group [ 27,28 ] . As shown in Fig. 1, however, the vibration band was affected by Ti4+, consequently shifted to a lower frequency and became broader with increasing Ti02content. This suggests the presence of some interaction between Ti02 and Si02 particles in the Ti02-Si02. This interaction may originate in the formation of Si-O-Ti bond as the following model: H O O -O-Si -0-Ti-0- I A I 0 O The formation of Si-O-Ti bond is also confirmed by XPS data, as will be described below. This band has already been observed in the IR spectra of crystalline titanium J.R.

Infrared band shift of Si-0 stretching vibration of silanol group in the Ti02-S'02 series catalysts. silicalite [ 29,30 ] . It seems likely that the shifts of the Si-0 stretching band for the silanol group are responsible for the weakness of the Si-0 bond by withdrawing electrons in the Si-O bond through the interaction between them. Tanabe et al. suggested a similar model in regard to the acidity generation of binary oxides [ 10] . For 87-Ti02-Si02 and pure Ti02. the weak and broad band around 920 cm-' is assigned to the stretching vibration of the Ti-O-Ti bonds [ 31 ] . We also examined the IR spectra of some physically mixed Ti02-Si02 samples, but the shifts of the Si-O stretching band for silanol groups was not observed. Therefore, it is clear that the shift of 974 cm'band mentioned above is not due to overlapping of the Ti-0 band. It is expected that the O-H bond of the silanol group is weakened by adding the Ti02component toSi02and by withdrawing electrons in the O-H bond due to the interaction between them as the above model. This is supported by the shift of OH stretching band of silanol group in the Ti02-Si02 samples. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the IR spectra of the pure samples without any binding material evacuated at 500 C for 2 h show some bands in the region 3800-3500 cm-' which could be assigned 153 154 J.R. Sohn et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994)149-167 3900 3800 3700 3600 3500 Fig. 2. Infrared spectra in the O-H stretching region (a) Si02, (b) 10-Si02-T'02.

The higher-frequency band at 3745 cm-' has been assigned to the v(OH) of free silanol groups, while the lower-frequency absorption at 3640 cm-' is due to that of hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups. The addition of Ti02 seems not only to decrease the intensity of free silanol groups but also to shift the position of free silanol groups toward a lower frequency. As shown in Fig. 2, the positions are 3745 cm-' for pure Si02, 3744 cm-' for 10-Ti02-Si02, 3742 cm-' for 37Ti02-Si02, 3741 cm-'for 53-Ti02-Si02, 3740 cm-'for 73-Ti02-SiOz, and 3739 cm-' for 87-Ti02-Si02. It seems relevant that the band of surface silanol shifts down considerably in the Ti02 content samples. These results can be explained by the weakness of the O-H bond of the silanol group as described above. It is clear that the shift of silanol frequency by the addition of Ti02 is correlated with that of Si-O stretching frequency of the silanol group described above. It is also expected JA Sohn et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994)149-167 155 that the weakness of the O-H bond does influence both acidity and acid strength, and acid catalytic activity of the catalyst as will be described below. On the other hand, on the low-frequency side of the silanol band, several components due to Ti02 are resolved (3681, 3670, 3645, 3624, and 3592 cm') . The spectrum of the pure Ti02 sample shows again bands at 3730, 3684, 3670, and 3641 cm-' together with a weak band at 3620 cm-' and the most intense band at 3710 cm-'. The hydroxyl band at 3730 cm-' is probably assigned to Si-OH impurities [ 33 ] . The OH groups responsible for the band at 3710 cm-'is presumed to be isolated Ti-OH, while the other peaks are assigned to hydrogen-bonded species located in an adjacent unit cell [ 34 ] . In general, the OH stretching vibrations situated above 3700 cm-' are assigned to free hydroxyl groups on almost any metal oxide [ 35 ] . The spectrum looks very similar to that of other anatase samples [36]. Fig. 3 gives the infrared spectra of Ti02 and 92-Ti02-Si02 modified with H2SO4- TS02- S02- i021 4 and 92-Ti02_Si02/ 4 (KBr disk) showed infrared absorption bands at 1200-1225, 1140-1130, 1060-1040 and 990-980 cm-' which are assigned to bidentate sulfate ion coordinated to the metal such as Ti\" or Si4+ as follows [ 37 ] M- o~ s /o M- 0~ \\0 In general, for the metal oxides modified with sulfate ion followed by evacuating above 400 C, a strong band assigned to S=O stretching frequency is observed at 1380-1370 cm-' [38,39]. In this work (Fig. 3b and d), the corresponding band for samples exposed to air was not found because water molecules in air were adsorbed on the surfaces of catalysts. These results are very similar to those reported by other authors [ 38,39 ] . However, in a separate experiment IR spectrum of selfsupported 92-TiOZ__Si02/504- after evacuation at 500 C for 2 h was examined, so that there was an intense band at 1369 cm-' (Fig. 3e) accompanied by broad and intense bands below 1250 cm-' due to the overlapping of the Si-0 skeletal vibration, indicating the presence of different adsorbed species depending on the treatment conditions of the sulfated sample [ 39 ] . However, the modification of the catalysts with HZS04 did not influence the shift of the Si-O stretching band of the silanol group. Strong absorption bands of sulfate ion still remained, even after evacuation at 400 C, indicating a very strong interaction between the sulfate ion and metal. 3.3. X-ray photoelectron spectra The IR data for the skeletal and silanol vibrations indicated the formation of SiO-Ti bond, that is, titanium silicate phase. To obtain further confirmation on the new phase, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic investigation was performed. Fig. 4 156 J.R.

For pure Si02 a binding energy of 533.1 eV is obtained for 015. For TiOZ-Si02 samples, a second 015 component is appearing at 530.2 eV, which is characteristic of Ols in Ti02 [40] . At compositions of 53 and 87 mol lo Ti02, however, the high binding energy Ols component shifts to a lower value of 532.5 eV. This lower Ols binding energy also identifies the formation of silicates [ 40] . From IR and XPS data, it was concluded that an amorphous Ti02_SiO2 phase was formed. For the samples modified with HZS04 followed by calcination at 400 C, based on infrared spectra results, the sulfur is considered to reach the highest oxidation state, S + 6 of 504- . However, the oxidation state of sulfur varies with the reductionoxidation process [ 24] . To confirm this conclusion X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic investigation was performed. Fig. 5 shows the X-ray photoelectron spectra J.R. Sohn et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994)149-167 0 37 --100 538 535 532 529 526 Binding Energy, aV Fig. 4.

As expected, both samples give the 2 signal attributed to S+6 [24], suggesting the oxidation state of sulfur as S0- as the main species. The SZp binding energy of S +6 was 168.8 eV [ 24,41 ] , calculated in reference to the C1S binding energy of 285.0 eV. 157 3.4. X-ray diffraction The crystalline structures of catalysts calcined in air at different temperatures for 1.5 h were checked by X-ray diffraction. In the case of a single Ti02, most of Ti02 calcined at 300 C was present as amorphous form to X-ray diffraction together with tiny amount of anatase. However, as shown in Fig. 6, the amount of anatase Ti02 increased remarkably at the calcination temperature of 350 C, indicating that amorphous Ti02 was transformed into anatase form, and then Ti02 was present as anatase form up to 700 C. There was a two phase mixture of the anatase and rutile forms at 800 C and just only rutile format 900 C. For Ti02/S04- similar results were obtained except that the transition temperature from amorphous to anatase was 100 C higher, as compared with pure Ti02- It is assumed that strong bond formation between sulfate ion and Ti02 hinders the transition from amorphous to anatase [ 24,25 ] . The addition of Si02 to Ti02 changed the crystalline structure of samples differently from that of a single Ti02- 10-Ti02-Si02 and 10-Ti02-Si02/504- calcined 158 J.R.

Sulfur XPS of (a) TiOz/504- and (b) 92-Ti02-SiOz/S04-. at 400-900 C produced materials which had only one broad structure in the X-ray diffraction patterns, suggesting largely amorphous silica. For 53-Ti02-Si02, X-ray diffraction data indicated poor crystallinity of the anatase Ti02 at 400 C and a two-phase mixture of anatase and rutile forms at 500 C. However, crystallinity of both forms became gradually better with increasing calcination temperature as shown in Fig. 7. For 53-Ti02-Si02/S04- (not shown here) similar results were obtained. At a composition of 92 mol% Ti02 the material became more crystalline. Fig. 8 represents the X-ray diffraction patterns of 92-Ti02-Si02 catalyst calcined in air at different temperature for 1.5 h. At 400 C of calcination temperature, anatase form of Ti02 was observed with a tiny amount of the rutile form of Ti02. However, the amount of both anatase and ruble increased with increasing calcination temperature up to 900 C. On the other hand, in the case of 92-Ti02-Si02/S04- (not shown here), there was only anatase at 400 C, but small amount of ruble began to be observed at 500 C. However, the increase of amount of anatase and ruble with the calcination temperature was similar to that of 92-Ti02-Si02. For Ti02 (Fig. 4) and Ti02/S04- , catalysts changed completely from anatase to rutile at 900 C unlike binary oxide catalysts of 92-Ti02-Si02. It seems likely that the presence of amorphous silica retards the transition from anatase to ruble. 3.5.

X-ray diffraction patterns of Ti02 calcined at different temperatures for 1.5 h: (O), tetragonal phase; ( ) monoclinic phase. at 400 C for 1 h was determined by the amine titration method at Ho = - 3.0, where Ho is Hammett acidity function. Fig. 9 shows the acidity of both series catalysts. The used indicator was dicinnamalacetone of Ho = - 3.0 and acidity was expressed as Ouiv/m2 of used catalyst. Although single component, Si02 showed little acidity, mixing of the two component, Ti02 and Si02 resulted in remarkable increase in acidity. This increase was not caused only by increase in surface area. As shown in Fig. 9, the acidity increases gradually upon the addition of Ti02 to Si02 reaching a maximum at 73-Ti02-Si02. These results are correlated with those of O-H and Si-O band stretching shifts of silanol group to lower frequencies upon the addition of Ti02 to Si02 described above. That is, the more the band shift, the more acidity has the catalyst. Many kinds of combinations of two oxides were reported to generate acid sites on the surface [ 8-10] . The combination of Ti02 and Si02 generated the stronger acid sites and the more acidity as compared with the single components. The mechanism for the generation of acid sites by mixing of two oxides has been proposed by Tanabe et al. [ 9,10] . They explained that the acidity generation is caused by an excess of a negative or positive charge in a model structure of a binary oxide related to the coordination number of a positive element. 160 J.R.

X-ray diffraction patterns of 53-TiO-S'02 calcined at different temperatures for 1.5 h: (O), tetragonal phase; ( ) monoclinic phase. Moreover, the modified catalysts had much more acidity than the unmodified catalysts. These results mean that the weak acid sites of unmodified catalysts are converted into strong acid sites by means of modifying the sample with H2S04. The acid strength of the catalysts was examined by color change method, using Hammett indicator [ 42 ] , when a powdered sample was added to an indicator dissolved in dried benzene. In Table 2, + indicates that the color of base form of an indicator was changed to that of the conjugated acid form. Ti02 prepared by evacuating titanium hydroxide at 400 C had acid strength of Ho -< - 3.0, while Si02 had very weak acid strength of Ho <- 3.3 [ 43 ] . However, as shown in Table 2, 73 Ti02-Si02 prepared by coprecipitation was estimated to be Ho _<< - 8.2, indicating the formation of new acid sites stronger than those of single oxide components. The other. binary oxides with various molar ratio of Ti021 Si02 also had the same acid strength of H.< _ - 8.2 as 73-Ti02-Si02. The acid strength of Si02/S04- was estimated to be Ho<_ -5.6, and that of Ti02/S04- and 73-TiO2-SiO2 was Ho s -14.5. Acids stronger than Ho = -11.93, which corresponds to the acid strength of 100% H 2S04, are superacids [44] . Consequently, Ti02/504- and 73 Ti02-Si02/504- would be solid superacids. The increase of acid strength in the modified catalysts is attributed to the double bond nature of S=O which strengthen the acid sites by the inductive effect [ 22] .

Infrared spectroscopic studies of pyridine adsorbed on solid surfaces have made it possible to distinguish between Bronsted and Lewis acid sites [45]. Fig. 10 shows the infrared spectra of pyridine adsorbed on Ti02 and Ti02/504- evacuated at 400 C for 1.5 h. The coordinated pyridine band at 1445 cm-' is found with Ti02. while both the pyridinium ion band at 1541 cm-' and the coordinated pyridine band at 1447 cm-1 are found with Ti02/S04-. It is clear that the new Bronsted acid site which is not present on pure Ti02 is formed by modifying Ti02 with HZS04. Fig. 11 shows the infrared spectra of pyridine adsorbed on 92-Ti02-Si02 and 92-Ti02-Si02/S04- evacuated at 400 C for 1.5 h. Both the absorption band at 1543 cm-t due to Bronsted acid and the band at 1445 cm-' by Lewis acid are found with them, indicating the presence of both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites. These results show that the addition of Ti02 to Si02 produces the new Bronsted acid sites through the interaction between Ti02 and Si02, although pure Ti02 has only Lewis acid sites as described above. Fig. 11 also shows the changes which 162 J.R. Sohn et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994)149-167 20 16 12 4.0 8 4 3.0 0 2.0 1.0 01100 0 Sioz 20 40 60 80'r=o2 Mole 91- Fig. 9.

The increases of intensities in both bands at 1543 and 1445 cm-' bands indicate that a considerable amount of Bronsted and Lewis acid sites has been formed newly by modifying the catalyst with H2S04. For other catalysts modified with H2S04 similar results were obtained. 3.6. Correlation between catalytic activity and acidic property It is interesting to examine how the catalytic activity of acid catalyst depends on the acidic property. The catalytic activities for the 2-propanol dehydration are Table 2 Acid strength of catalysts Hammett indicator pKa of Si02 Si02/ Ti02 Ti02/ 73-Ti02- 73-Ti02 indicator SO;- S04' Si02 Si02/S04- dimethyl yellow + 3.3 + + + + + + dicinnamal acetone -3.0 - + + + + + benzalaceto phenone -5.6 - + - + + + antraquinone - 8.2 - - - + + + nitrobenzene -12.4 - - - + - + 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene - 14.5 - - - + - + JA Sohn et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994)149-167 is b LI I i LI 1700 1600 1500 1400 163 Fig. 10.

In view of Figs. 9 and 12, the variations in catalytic activities of unmodified Ti02Si02 catalysts are roughly correlated with the changes of their acidity. As shown in Fig. 12, the catalysts modified with H2S04 exhibit higher catalytic activity than unmodified catalysts. The modification effect on the catalytic activity was much greater in the catalysts having high Ti02 content. Actually, the catalytic activity of 92-Ti02-Si02/S04- was 20 times as high as 92-Ti02-Si02, while 10-Ti02 Si02/ S04- exhibited only 1.5 times activity. We could make an estimate from these results that Ti02 has more of an effect on the modification than Si02. These results are in agreement with the report that sulfate species formed on silica are much less thermally stable than those formed on A1203, Ti02 or Zr02 [ 39 ] . However, in the case of modified catalysts, the correlation between catalytic activity and acidity does not hold good. Although the acidity of Ti02/SO4- is highest, its catalytic activity is relatively low. It has been known that 2-propanol dehydration takes place very readily on weak acid sites [ 25,46 ] . Therefore, it seems that in the case of TS02- i021 4 the number of weak acid sites decreased due to the conversion of weak acid sites into strong acid sites by the modification with HZS04. Another possibility is to consider not the acidity alone but acid-base pair sites [47] . The modification with 112S04 increases the acidity but decreases the basicity because sulfate adsorp- 164 JA Sohn et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994)149-167 1445 1700 1600 1500 1400 Fig. 11.

As seen in Fig. 12 and 13, the catalytic activity for cumene dealkylation, in spite of higher reaction temperature, is much lower than that for 2-propanol dehydration. 4. Conclusions A series of catalysts, Ti02-Si02 with different compositions and modified with H2S04 were prepared by a coprecipitation method, and the following facts are demonstrated in this work. (1) Modifying Ti02 with H2S04 shifted the transition of Ti02 from amorphous to anatase form to high temperature. (2) The addition Of Si02 to Ti02 delayed the transition from anatase to rutile form. (3) The addition of Ti02 to Si02 resulted in the formation of Si-0-Ti bond, and caused shifts in the O-H and Si-O stretching bands of silanol group to lower frequencies in proportion to the Ti02 content. These band shifts were correlated with both acidity and acid catalytic activity of the Ti02-Si02 catalysts. (4) Modification with H2S04 enhanced the activities of the catalysts remarkably, thus being responsible for the superacidic properties of the modified catalysts. The modification effect on catalytic activity increased with increasing the Ti02 content of catalysts.

A series of TiO2SiO2 catalysts were prepared by coprecipitation from the mixed solution of titanium tetrachloride and sodium silicate. Some of the sample were modified with 0.5 M H2SO4 and used as modified catalysts. The addition of TiO2 to SiO2 caused the increase of acidity and acid strength, and the shifts of OH and SiO stretching bands of silanol group to lower frequencies in proportion to the TiO2 content. Catalytic activities for 2-propanol dehydration and cumene dealkylation increased in relation to the increase of acidity and the band shifts to lower frequencies. The catalytic activities of modified catalysts were higher than those of unmodified catalysts, and the effect of modification on catalytic activity was higher for 2-propanol dehydration than for cumene dealkylation. The effect of modification on catalytic activity increased with increasing TiO2 content of the catalysts. Actually, 92-TiO2SiO2/SO2− 4 had the highest increment in catalytic activity and 10-TiO2SiO2/SO2− 4 had the lowest increment for the 2-propanol dehydration.

        "dc:description": "A series of TiO2SiO2 catalysts were prepared by coprecipitation from the mixed solution of titanium tetrachloride and sodium silicate. Some of the sample were modified with 0.5 M H2SO4 and used as modified catalysts. The addition of TiO2 to SiO2 caused the increase of acidity and acid strength, and the shifts of OH and SiO stretching bands of silanol group to lower frequencies in proportion to the TiO2 content. Catalytic activities for 2-propanol dehydration and cumene dealkylation increased in relation to the increase of acidity and the band shifts to lower frequencies. The catalytic activities of modified catalysts were higher than those of unmodified catalysts, and the effect of modification on catalytic activity was higher for 2-propanol dehydration than for cumene dealkylation. The effect of modification on catalytic activity increased with increasing TiO2 content of the catalysts. Actually, 92-TiO2SiO2/SO2− 4 had the highest increment in catalytic activity and 10-TiO2SiO2/SO2− 4 had the lowest increment for the 2-propanol dehydration.",
