Graphical abstract Five novel binuclear titanocenes (CpTiCl2)2[(C5H4)CH2(p-C6H4)O(CH2) n O(C6H4-p)–CH2(C5H4)] (n =2–6) (16–20) with the bridge combination of rigid and flexible segment were synthesized. In the presence of methylaluminoxane, the behaviors of these complexes toward ethylene polymerization were investigated. The results show that their catalytic behaviors are highly dependent on the length of flexible segment and polymerization conditions. Five novel binuclear titanocenes (CpTiCl2)2[(C5H4)CH2(p-C6H4)O(CH2) n O(C6H4-p)CH2(C5H4)] (n =2–6) (16–20) with the bridge combination of rigid and flexible segment were synthesized and characterized. In the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO), the behaviors of these complexes toward ethylene polymerization were investigated. The results show that their catalytic behaviors are highly dependent on the length of flexible segment and polymerization conditions. With the length of flexible segment becoming longer, the catalytic activity increases, whereas the molecular weight (M W) of the produced polyethylene (PE) decreases. In addition, the longer flexible segment is favorable to produce PE with broader molecular weight distribution (MWD). Keywords Binuclear Titanocene Metallocene catalyst Polyethylene 1 Introduction Binuclear metallocenes used as catalysts for olefin polymerization can be divided roughly into two kinds in terms of the bridge [1], flexible bridge such as polymethylene [2–5], polysiloxane or silane [2,6–11] and rigid bridge such as phenylene [1,12,13], biphenylene [14,15], double bridges [16–18]. In general, binuclear metallocenes with a rigid bridge show higher activity and thermal stability [15]. In continuation of our previous investigation on binuclear metallocenes with rigid [1,12,14,19] or flexible bridge [3–5,20], here we report the synthesis of novel binuclear titanocenes (C5H5TiCl2)2[(C5H4)CH2(p-C6H4)O(CH2) n O(C6H4-p)CH2(C5H4)] (n =2–6) (16–20) with the bridge combination of rigid and flexible segment. The behaviors of these complexes toward ethylene polymerization were investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 General procedures All manipulations involving air- or moisture-sensitive compounds were performed under an atmosphere of argon using standard Schlenk techniques. Elemental analyses were conducted on a Perkin-Elmer 240 elemental analyzer. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance 400 instrument at ambient temperature using CDCl3 as solvent and tetramethylsilane as internal standard. The intrinsic viscosity [η] of PE in decahydronaphthalene was measured with a modified Ubbelohde viscometer at 135°C. The viscosity-averaged molecular weight (M η ) was calculated according to the equation [ η ] = 6.67 × 10 − 4 M η 0.67 ( ml / g ) [21]. The molecular weight distributions (MWD) of PE were determined by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC, Waters 150, 135°C) with standard polystyrene as a calibration reference. The melting point temperatures (T m) of PE were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer DSC-7 differential scanning calorimeter. All chemical reagents used were of analytical grade and were further purified as given in the literature. Toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), diethyl ether, and hexane were freshly distilled under argon from purple sodium/benzophenone ketyl solutions. CH2Cl2 was distilled under argon from CaH2. Cyclopentadiene was freshly distilled from its dimer. Methylaluminoxane (MAO) (10% in toluene) was purchased from Witco. Ethylene (polymer grade) was purified via bubbling through triisobutylaluminum in toluene. Cyclopentadienyltitaniumtrichloride (CpTiCl3) [22] was prepared according to the literature. 2.2 Synthesis of compounds 2.2.1 p-CH3C6H4O(CH2) n OC6H4CH3-p (n =2–6) (1–5) p-Cresol (21.60g, 0.20mol) was added to a stirred solution of sodium hydroxide (8.80g, 0.22mol) in 150ml of ethanol at room temperature. After stirring for 0.5h, 0.10mol of Br(CH2) n Br (n =2–6) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for another 8h under refluxing and then poured into water (500ml). The resulting mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered. The remaining solid was washed with water (2× 30ml) and ethanol (2× 20ml), and then dried in vacuo to give the products as white solids. 1: yield: 8.18g (33.8%); m.p. 137–138°C; 1H NMR: δ =2.30 (s, 6H, 2× CH3), 4.29 (s, 4H, 2× CH2), 6.86 (d, J =8.4Hz, 4H, 2× C6H4), 7.09 (d, J =8.4Hz, 4H, 2× C6H4). 2: yield: 14.4g (56.3%); m.p. 98–100°C; 1H NMR: δ =2.24 (m, 2H, CH2), 2.28 (s, 6H 2× CH3), 4.12 (t, J =6.4Hz, 4H, 2× CH2), 6.78 (d, J =8.4Hz, 4H, 2× C6H4), 7.07 (d, J =8.4Hz, 4H, 2× C6H4). 3: yield: 17.2g (63.8%); m.p. 109–111°C; 1H NMR: δ =1.95 (m, 4H, 2× CH2), 2.28 (s, 6H 2× CH3), 3.99 (t, J =5.2Hz, 4H, 2× CH2), 6.78 (d, J =8.4Hz, 4H, 2× C6H4), 7.06 (d, J =8.4Hz, 4H, 2× C6H4). 4: yield: 24.6g (86.6%); m.p. 68–70°C; 1H NMR: δ =1.65 (m, 2H, CH2), 1.84 (m, 4H, 2× CH2), 2.28 (s, 6H 2× CH3), 3.95 (t, J =6.4Hz, 4H, 2× CH2), 6.80 (d, J =8.4Hz, 4H, 2× C6H4), 7.06 (d, J =8.4Hz, 4H, 2× C6H4). 5: yield: 27.2g (91.3%); m.p. 88–91°C; 1H NMR: δ =1.52 (m, 4H, 2× CH2), 1.79 (m, 4H, 2× CH2), 2.28 (s, 6H 2× CH3), 3.93 (t, J =6.4Hz, 4H, 2× CH2), 6.78 (d, J =8.4Hz, 4H, 2× C6H4), 7.05 (d, J =8.4Hz, 4H, 2× C6H4). 2.2.2 p-BrCH2C6H4O(CH2) n OC6H4CH2Br-p (n =2–6) (6–10) A mixture of 1 (6.05g, 25mmol), N-bromosuccinimide (9.10g, 51mmol), dibenzoyl peroxide (0.50g, 2mmol) and CCl4 (80ml) was refluxed 5h under stirring.

The temperature of the reaction mixture was allowed to rise gradually to room temperature and the mixture was stirred for 2h. The solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue was extracted with diethyl ether (3× 25ml). The combined extracts were added to a stirred solution of n-BuLi (6.3ml, 1.6M, 10mmol) in hexane at 0°C. The mixture was stirred for additional 8h and filtered.

The reactor was filled with a proper amount of toluene and MAO solution and saturated with a continuous flow of ethylene under atmospheric pressure. The polymerization was initiated by injection of the catalyst solution. The reaction mixture was stirred for an appropriate period at the desired temperature. A mixture of ethanol (150ml) and hydrochloric acid (10ml) was added to quench the reaction. The precipitated PE was filtered, washed repeatedly with water and ethanol, and then dried in vacuo at 60°C. In analogous procedure, the ethylene polymerizations were carried out in a 100ml autoclave under high ethylene pressure. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Synthesis and characterizations of complex 16–20 The α,ω-bis (4-bromomethylphenoxy)alkanes 6–10 [23] were prepared according to Scheme 1 starting with p-cresole via the α,ω-bis (4-methylphenoxy)alkanes 1–4 [24–26] and 5. They react with cyclopentadienyl sodium and butyl lithium with formation of the air- and moisture-sensitive dilithium salts 11–15 (Scheme 2 ), which were isolated as pale yellow powders. Reaction with C5H4TiCl3 affords the dinuclear titanium complexes 16–20. Their 1H NMR spectra show two sets of triplets at 6.34–6.44ppm similar to analogous bridged binuclear titanocenes [1,12,14,19]. 3.2 Polymerization results of ethylene with complex 16–20 Complexes 16–20 have been studied as catalysts in combination with MAO for ethylene polymerization. Table 1 demonstrates that the catalytic behaviors of these complexes 16–20 are highly depended on the length of flexible segment in the bridge. The catalytic activity increases with lengthening of the flexible segment (16 < 17 < 18 < 19 < 20). That is in accordance with the activity tendency of polysiloxane or polymethylene bridged binuclear zirconocenes [2,7] and can be attributed to the stronger steric hindrance of binuclear metallocenes caused by the shorter bridge, which prevents the monomer accessing to the coordination sites. In addition, an intramolecular deactivation of the active species in the same molecules may be restricted by long bridge. The M η of the produced PE decreases in the order 16 > 17 > 18 > 19 > 20, which can be interpreted by the steric hindrance of the shorter bridge which suppresses the β-H transfer to the active species, favorable for producing PE with higher molecular weight [7]. As expected, the MWD of PE produced by 16–20 (MWD=3.99–5.35) are obviously broader than that of PE produced by (C5H5)2TiCl2 (MWD=1.92) [1], moreover, it increase with the length of flexible segment in the bridge of these complexes becoming longer (16 < 17 < 18 < 19 < 20). The reason may be that the interaction between two metals creates more than one kind of active species during the polymerization [27]. The melting points of the PE produced by the novel complexes 16–20 were all higher than 130°C, which indicates that the PE are highly linear and highly crystalline PE [14,27]. Table 2 shows, that the catalytic activity of complex 19 decreases faster than that of the 4,4-bis (methylene)biphenylene bridged dinuclear titanocene (CpTiCl2)2[C5H4CH2C6H4-p-C6H4CH2C5H4] (21) [14] with rising of polymerization temperature. The reason may be that the introduction of a flexible segment [–O(CH2) n O–] into the bridge lowers the thermal stability of the active species formed in the process of ethylene polymerization. Compared with ethylene polymerization catalyzed by complex 21, a lower catalyst concentration is more favorable to reach a high activity for complex 19. 3.3 Effects of polymerization conditions on ethylene polymerization with complex 19 Complex 19 was used to test the effect of the polymerization conditions such as catalyst concentration, mole ratio of MAO/Ti, polymerization temperature, polymerization time and ethylene pressure. The preliminary results show that a proper catalyst concentration and mole ratio of MAO/Ti are favorable for reaching high catalytic activity and producing PE with high molecular weight (Figs. 1 and 2 ). Fig. 3 illustrates the effect of the temperature on ethylene polymerization. Both the catalytic activity and M η of PE decrease rapidly with rising temperature, which demonstrates that higher temperature leads to faster deactivation of active species [28]. Fig. 4 demonstrates that the catalytic activity decreases with the prolongation of time, however M η of PE is still increasing, which is in agreement with the common sense of homogeneous polymerization by metallocene/MAO. Fig. 5 illustrates the effect of the ethylene pressure on polymerization. High ethylene pressure is effective for both increasing of catalytic activity and M η of the produced PE. 4 Conclusion The novel binuclear titanocenes (CpTiCl2)2[(C5H4)CH2(p-C6H4)O(CH2) n O(C6H4-p)CH2(C5H4)] (n =2–6) (16–20) have been synthesized and successfully used as homogeneous catalysts with MAO as cocatalyst for ethylene polymerization. The results show that the bridge including flexible and rigid segment effectively improved the catalytic behaviors of metallocene catalyst. The increase of the length of flexible segment is obviously favorable to rise the catalytic activities and broaden the MWD of PE (16 < 17 < 18 < 19 < 20). Both catalytic activities and MW of PE obtained from these complexes are remarkable higher than those of Cp2TiCl2, especially, the MWD (3.99–5.35) of PE obtained from all these complexes are much more broader than that of PE produced by Cp2TiCl2.

In the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO), the behaviors of these complexes toward ethylene polymerization were investigated. The results show that their catalytic behaviors are highly dependent on the length of flexible segment and polymerization conditions. With the length of flexible segment becoming longer, the catalytic activity increases, whereas the molecular weight (M W) of the produced polyethylene (PE) decreases. In addition, the longer flexible segment is favorable to produce PE with broader molecular weight distribution (MWD).",
