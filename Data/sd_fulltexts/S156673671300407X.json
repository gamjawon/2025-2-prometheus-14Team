Short Communication Promotional effect of graphite oxide on surface properties and catalytic performance of La1−xSrxMnO3 (x=0,0.1) for methane combustion Saifei Wang Gang Xue ⁎ Jinsheng Liang Yankun Yuan Xueliang Zhang Institute of Power Source and Ecomaterials Science, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin 300130, China Institute of Power Source and Ecomaterials Science School of Materials Science and Engineering Hebei University of Technology Tianjin 300130 China ⁎ Corresponding author. Tel.: +86 22 60202973. The effect of graphite oxide (i.e. GO)/La1−xSrxMnO3 (x=0,0.1) catalysts on methane combustion in CNG's (compressed natural gas) exhaust was investigated in current work. GO layer was employed to realize a surface modification. The light-off temperature of methane decreased, and reached the full conversion at 540°C. The prepared catalysts were also characterized by TEM, surface energy, XPS and H2-TPR techniques. SEM indicated that the La1−xSrxMnO3 particles grew dispersedly on GO layer, and surface analysis suggested that the introducing of GO can enhance the adsorption of oxygen groups on the surface of the catalysts. Graphical abstract In the study, we coated graphite oxide on traditional perovskite catalysts to improve the surface properties. The oxygen groups in GO introduced more oxygen species to the catalyst surface, thus speed up the methane catalytic reaction — the light-off temperature of methane dropped at 70°C, and reached the full conversion at 540°C. Keywords Graphite oxide Perovskite Methane Catalyst 1 Introduction As an alternative fuel for internal combustion engines (ICE), compressed natural gas (CNG) has been considered to be more environment friendly, and has been widely used since the last decade [1–3]. With the more stringent environmental protection laws and regulations, the technology of methane catalytic flameless combustion is arousing more interest due to its low emission. The catalysts for the treatment of the unburnt methane after engines can be divided into noble metal catalysts and metal oxide catalysts according to the active component. In 1970 Voorhoeve [4] used rare earth to synthesize perovskite-type oxides (ABO3) and proposed that it may take place of noble metal catalysts. Since then, perovskites have been extensively investigated as catalysts for methane combustion for fossil fuel burners and automobile exhausts [5–8]. Among various perovskites LaMnO3 has received much attention due to its high catalytic activity [9,10]. Substituted perovskites derived from LaMnO3, e.g. partial substitution of La3+ by alkali or alkaline earth ions such as K+, Sr2+ and Ce2+ have been also extensively studied [5,11–14]. However, the catalytic activity of perovskite catalysts is generally much lower than that of noble metals, which considered as a major impediment for its application. The structure and surface characteristics of perovskites, which are correlated with the surface oxygen species and redox properties, play decisive roles in catalytic activity [15–17]. Graphite oxide (i.e. GO) has many oxygen groups on the laminated surface — carboxyl and alcohol in its edge, while epoxy and alcohol in sp2 hybrid orbital plane [18]. These oxygen functional groups make GO hydrophilic, thus easily forming stable thin layer in a polar solvent [19], which can be used to prepare excellent composite material with most metal or metal oxide. Furthermore, GO has high specific surface area and ion exchange ability. All of these make GO widely researched in composite materials [18,20,21], catalyst [22], battery [23,24], super capacitor [24] and other areas. So far, we found no reports of the effect of GO on perovskites for surface modification and catalytic performance. In current work, we prepared a series of La1−xSrxMnO3/GO by a simple method and tested their catalytic performance in methane combustion. It has also been studied how the large surface area and active oxygen groups of GO modified the perovskite surface and improve the surface reduction ability. 2 Experiment 2.1 Catalysts preparation La1−xSrxMnO3 (x=0,0.1) perovskite catalysts were synthesized by the citric acid gel–sol method [25]. In detail, aqueous solutions of starting nitrates with the stoichiometric ratio in the catalysts were mixed with an aqueous solution of citric acid. The molar ratio of the total metal ion and citric acid was 1:1.2. The mixed solution was evaporated at 80°C till it formed wet gel, then dried overnight and crushed, calcinated for 5h in the muffle furnace at 800°C. The GO was prepared according to the Hummers method reported before [18]. The obtained La1−xSrxMnO3 and GO with a mass ratio of 10:1 were further dispersed in 60mL of mixed solution of ethanol (30mL) and deionized (DI) water (30mL). Then the mixture was put in the round bottomed flask, heated up to boiling and refluxed for 2h. The specific experiment parameters applied in the synthesis of various catalysts were collected in Table 1 . 2.2 Characterization The samples were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (BRUKER D8 FOCUS, Germany) using a Cu Kα source (λ=0.154056nm) at a scanning speed of 3°min−1 over a 2θ range of 10–90°. The morphologies and structures were observed by using transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM 2100 system operating at 200kV). N2 adsorption/desorption was determined by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurement by using an ASAP-2010 surface area analyzer. The Raman analysis of the sample was recorded by Laser Raman (Renishaw Invia Reflex laser micro Raman spectrometer, wavelength 532nm). The electronic conductivity of the synthesized sample was evaluated by a four-point probe meter (SDY, Guangzhou, China). Surface energy was carried out by Automatic surface tensiometer (DCAT21 Dataphysics Company, Germany) to further confirm the surface adsorption performance. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was recorded on a K-Alpha spectrometer equipped with Al Kα radiation. H2-TPR also applied to detect the catalyst redox properties (Micromeritics Company AutoChem II 2920, USA, temperature from room temperature to 1000°C, heating rate 10°C/min, TCD detector). 2.3 Catalytic activity measurement The catalytic combustion of methane at 200°C–600°C was carried out using the WFS-3015 catalyst evaluation device (XianQuan Industry, Tianjin). The quartz reactor was loaded with ~500mg of catalyst. Mixtures of methane and air were fed to the reactor (9vol.% CH4) with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 4000mLg−1 h−1. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD analysis Fig. 1 shows the typical XRD patterns of the as-fabricated catalysts. Notably, the strong diffraction peak at 2θ=32.5° is observed, indicating a well-crystallized ABO3 perovskite structure [26], and the main phase is LaMnO3 for all the catalysts. Of particular note, the diffraction peaks of the LSM show a weak peak of La2O3, which may caused by the low-valence alkaline earth element Sr replacing La and controlling Mn ions valence state. But this peak disappeared in the LSM/GO catalysts, indicates that GO adding could inhibit the generation of mixed phase. 3.2 Raman spectra Fig. 2 is the Raman spectra of as-prepared catalysts. As presented in Fig. 2a and b, two prominent bands, i.e., the “D-band” and “G-band” centered at the wave number of 1355 and 1605cm−1, respectively, are observed for the LM/GO and LSM/GO samples, which is in agreement with the Raman data of the GO reported before [27], while barely any features are obtained from LM and LSM. Fig. 2 illustrates that the GO maintains the original structure in the composite. 3.3 TEM micrographs Fig. 3a presented the typical translucent fold morphology of GO. As shown in Fig. 3b and c, both the LM and LSM samples present typical nanoparticle (NP) structure. And as for the LM/GO and LSM/GO catalysts, obviously, these rare earth catalyst NPs, like stars in the sky, embedded in GO layer with good dispersion (Fig. 3d–f). This structural feature, including small size and good dispersion, ensures much more exposure active sites on the surface. 3.4 Surface analysis In order to study the influence of GO upon the surface properties of the as-prepared catalysts, we managed the surface free energy (SE) tests (see Table 2 ). The collected data clearly demonstrates that the polarity component (Polar) greatly increased after adding GO, while the dispersion component (Disp) basically remains unchanged, and the overall results are the enhancement of SE. The increasement of Polar can be owed to the oxygen groups on GO layer. The N2-adsorption data of the four catalysts are also collected in Table 2. Obviously, the BET surface area of the LM and LSM NPs all increased after well-dispersed upon the GO, reached 13.5403m2/g and 15.7215m2/g, respectively, while the aperture size reduced, down to 17.8879nm and 18.0845nm, respectively. This indicates the LM and LSM have more tightly pore distribution. Higher SE and larger BET surface area would benefit for the adsorption of methyl groups i.e. CH3, CH2 and CHO etc., as well as exposed more active sites on the surface of catalysts, thus speed up the methane catalytic combustion effectively. XPS analysis (see Fig. 4 ) revealed that the spectra of O 1s consist of a doublet, implying that at least two kinds of oxygen are present on the catalyst surface: a low binding energy at 529.5–529.7eV, corresponds to lattice oxygen (Olat) and a peak at 531.3–531.6eV, corresponds to surface adsorbed oxygen (Oads), which mainly in the form of carbonate and hydroxyl species as well as weakly bound oxygen on the surface [16,28]. Compared with LM and LSM, the content of oxygen on the LM/GO and LSM/GO surface increased significantly, and the [Oads]/[Olat] ratio illustrates that the increasement mainly attribute to the surface adsorbed oxygen. Combine with the SE analysis, GO introduced much absorbed oxygen species on the catalyst surface and formed covering structure. 3.5 Redox ability Fig. 5 shows the H2-TPR (H2-temperature programmed reduction) spectrogram of prepared catalysts. Two major peaks of H2 reduction are detected on each sample. The first one appears around 300°C, and the other centers at 800°C. As previously reported [29], the first peak, i.e., low temperature peak (LTP), caused by the reduction of the high-valence Mn4+ to Mn3+ and/or the surficial Mn3+ to Mn2+, corresponding the removal of surface oxygen. The second peak, i.e., high temperature peak (HTP), related to the Mn3+ in the structure to low-valence Mn2+, representing the removal of bulk oxygen. The LTP is consistent with the light-off temperature of methane catalytic combustion, which illustrates that the surface oxygen participates and determines the catalytic reaction. The consumed surface oxygen can be further supplemented by the bulk oxygen. Compared the H2-TPR curve of prepared samples, GO-coated catalysts all possess sharp and stronger LTP than the single LM or LSM catalyst. The hydrogen consumption in the LTP peak has also been determined in order to ensure if more oxygen species are introduced. The hydrogen consumption of the as-fabricated catalysts are the following: 2.1774mmol/g for LM, 2.4980mmol/g for LM/GO, 2.0061mmol/g for LSM and 2.4892mmol/g for LSM/GO. It shows that oxygen groups in GO introduce more oxygen species (mainly are surface oxygen species, according to XPS results) to the catalyst surface, and lamellar GO can absorb more hydrogen molecules. For the extraction of surface oxygen that plays a decisive role, it is crucial to enhance the content of surface oxygen. The redox ability has linear relationship with catalytic activity, which can be confirmed in the catalytic activity data. The weak peak appeared around 600°C has a left shift in GO-added samples, which can attribute to the change of structural feature. 3.6 Activity on methane catalytic combustion Catalytic activity data for methane combustion are presented in Fig. 6 . By expressing the activity through the light-off temperature (T 50) at which 50% of methane conversion is reached, and complete transform temperature (T 90) at which 90% of methane conversion is reached, GO added samples all have lower T 50 and T 90 than single LM or LSM. The T 50 of LM and LSM are in accordance with previous data [12,30]. The T 50 of LM/GO and LSM/GO are 435°C and 440°C, each dropped 30°C and 70°C in contrast to that of LM and LSM. The T 90 of LM/GO and LSM/GO are 535°C and 525°C respectively. The combustion process is significantly shortened and finished before 540°C — the lowest complete temperature is 535°C. It is also noteworthy that the reactive curves for LM/GO and LSM/GO are almost coincident, this might attribute to the existence of GO. The content of oxygen species increases, the redox ability tends to be uniform (according to the H2-TPR results), and the difference of the two reactive curves in methane combustion is indistinct. We also test the blank sample B to explore the catalytic properties of GO, the results show that there's no catalytic effect. 3.7 Reaction mechanism Based on the above study, it can be assumed that GO-coated samples have higher specific surface and more easily absorb reactants such as oxygen and methyl groups. The catalytic mechanism may act like this: the oxygen groups on the GO decomposed or attract free oxygen species, the migration rate of bulk to surface oxygen speeds up, leads to high concentration of surface oxygen, thus enhances the oxygen extraction, and improves the whole catalytic reaction. CH4 absorbed on the catalyst surface and dissociated into hydrogen and methyl groups, the hydrogen reacts with gaseous oxygen to generate water vapor under high temperature and desorbed from the catalyst surface. The methyl groups, according to Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, continue to decompose under the oxidation of surface oxygen until it forms the final product — CO2. In the process, bulk oxygen migrates to complement surface oxygen, while gaseous oxygen continues to supplement the bulk oxygen. 4 Conclusions In summary, graphite oxide (i.e. GO)/La1−xSrxMnO3 (x=0,0.1) catalysts were successfully fabricated from the approach. The SE, BET, H2-TPR and XPS characterizations revealed that GO covering can enlarge the surface area of the catalyst particles, and bring more absorbed oxygen species on the catalyst surface to form covering structure. The comparatively higher surface oxygen species enabled better catalytic activity for methane combustion. The light-off temperature of GO/La1−xSrxMnO3 (x=0,0.1) catalysts decrease 15% compared to that of La1−xSrxMnO3 (x=0,0.1), among the prepared samples LM/GO performs the best — light off at 435°C and finish catalytic process at 535°C. The stability of the catalysts will be taking into account in our further research.
