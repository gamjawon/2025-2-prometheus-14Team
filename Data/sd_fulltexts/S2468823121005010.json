N-alkyl-5-methyl-2-pyrrolidones are an attractive alternative to the common solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and can be used as starting materials for synthesis of various valuable chemicals. Reductive amination of alkyl levulinates derived from biomass feedstock is a promising method for production of these compounds. In the present work, N-alkyl-5-methyl-2-pyrrolidones were obtained in excellent yields by reductive amination of ethyl levulinate with alkylamines over SiO2-supported nickel phosphide in a flow reactor using molecular hydrogen as a reducing agent. At the same time, aromatic amines and 1-nitropropane give a lower yield of the corresponding pyrrolidones. The influence of the solvent nature, temperature, pressure, hydrogen and liquid flow rates on the catalyst performance was studied.

Levulinic acid (LA) and its esters, known as platform molecules derived from biomass feedstock, can be converted into different valuable chemicals. One of the important classes of such compounds is N-alkyl-5-methyl-2-pyrrolidones which can be applied as a more environmentally benign alternative to common solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) or as the starting material for the synthesis of agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals [1-6]. Reductive amination of LA or alkyl levulinates (e.g., ethyl levulinate) with primary amines over heterogeneous catalysts using H2 as hydrogen source is an attractive approach for production of N-substituted 5-methyl-2-pyrrolidones [7-24]. This reaction has been realized in the presence of noble metal-based catalysts, such as Pt/TiO2 [7-10], Pt-MoOX/TiO2 [11], Pt/C [12], Pt immobilized on the solid acid Aquivion [13], Au-Pd/C [14], Pd/ZrO2 [15], Ru/C [16], polymeric ruthenium porphyrin-functionalized carbon nanotubes [17], polyvinylpyrrolidone stabilized Ir nanoparticles [18], g-C3N4/Pt composite [19] and Ru/TiO2 [20]. However, the high price and limited availability of precious metals are stimulated interest in the development of the catalysts based on earth-abundant elements [4]. There are only few works [21–24] dealing with the performance of non-noble metal based catalysts in reductive amination of levulinic acid. G. Gao et al. [21] investigated the reaction of LA with benzylamine over porous-carbon-coated nickel catalysts, which were obtained by sequential deposition of NiO nanoparticles and polyimide films on carbon nanotubes using atomic layer deposition technique (ALD). The pyrrolidone yield of 99% was achieved in a batch reactor at 130 °C and H2 pressure of 30 bar using γ-valerolactone (GVL) as a solvent. However, the expensive multi-stage procedure for the catalyst preparation hinders the practical application of these systems. Supported Cu-based catalysts were also used for the conversion of LA with primary amines to N-substituted 5-methyl-2-pyrrolidones [22]. The doping of praseodymium into Cu/Al2O3 sample highly enhanced the catalytic performance due to better dispersion of metallic copper. In spite of the fact that a wide range of N-substituted pyrrolidones were obtained in good to excellent yields, there are some drawbacks of this method. The reaction should be carried out with a 50% excess of amine under harsh conditions (20 h, 175 °C, 50 bar of H2) in 1,4-dioxane, which is not a suitable solvent from a safety point of view [25]. Chieffi et al. studied the reductive amination of LA over carbonized filter paper-supported Fe-Ni alloy under flow conditions [23]. Advantages of continuous flow synthesis over traditional batch protocols include higher productivity, suppression of by-product formation through a better control over reaction parameters, simplified scaling, lower operational costs and limiting employee contact with toxic chemicals, which makes such processes safer and more attractive to implement [26-28]. However, only phenethylamine was used as a substrate, and good yield of pyrrolidone was achieved only with a two-fold excess of LA at a high hydrogen pressure (85 bar). In another work, N-ethyl-5-methyl-2-pyrrolidone was obtained with good selectivity by hydroconversion of LA in a flow reactor over Ni3N and Ni nanoparticles using acetonitrile as both solvent and reactant [24]. Thus, the development of an efficient catalyst based on transition metals (such as, Ni and Cu) for reductive amination of LA (or its esters) to pyrrolidones remains an actual task. To synthesize pyrrolidinones from LA (or its esters), three steps are generally required, involving (1) imine formation through the condensation of LA with primary amine, (2) metal-catalyzed hydrogenation of imine to γ-amino-pentanoic acid, and (3) subsequent intramolecular amidation to target pyrrolidinone [1-5]. Beneficial impact of catalyst's acidity on the pyrrolidone yield was observed [7-13,15,22] that is explained by the acceleration of the steps (1) and (3) in the presence of acid sites [1,2]. In recent years, nickel phosphides have attracted increased attention of researchers as catalysts for hydrotreating reactions (HDS, HDN) and hydrodeoxygenation of biomass (or model biofuel compounds) to transportation fuels due to the presence of both metallic and acidic centers. It is generally accepted that nickel phosphides contain weak Bronsted and Lewis acid sites, which is attributed to the unreduced POx groups and nickel metal sites with small positive charge, induced by a slight charge transfer from Ni to P in nickel phosphide particles [29-31]. In present study, we investigated the reductive amination of ethyl levulinate with primary amines to pyrrolidones over SiO2-supported nickel phosphide in a flow reactor. 2 Experimental part 2.1 Chemicals Ethyl levulinate (98%, Acros Organics), n-hexylamine (99%, Acros Organics), butylamine (>99%, Acros Organics), aniline (99.8%, Acros Organics), p-toluidine (99%, Acros Organics), 1-nitropropane (98%, Acros Organics), and n-decane (99%, Acros Organics) were used without additional purification. Toluene (99.5%, “ECOS” Russia), methanol (99.8%, J.T. Baker), isopropanol (99.8%, “Reakhim” Russia), and γ-valerolactone (98%, Acros Organics) were employed as solvents. Ni(CH3COO)2•4H2O (≥98%, Reachim, Russia), (NH4)2HPO4 (Alfa Aesar, technical grade) and HNO3 («Reachim», ∼70%) were used for the catalyst preparation. The silica (“KSKG”, BET surface area – 300 m2 g − 1, pore volume – 0.80 cm3 g − 1, average pore diameter – 10.6 nm) was supplied from “ChromAnalit” Ltd. (Russia). Prior to use for catalyst preparation, granules of support were crushed, sieved to a fraction of 0.25–0.50 mm and dried at 110 °C for 4 h. 2.2 Catalyst preparation The Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst was prepared by impregnation of SiO2 with aqueous solutions of Ni(CH3COO)2 and (NH4)2HPO4 followed by drying in air at room temperature overnight, at 110 °C for 3 h and calcination at 500 °C for 3 h (initial Ni/P molar ratio of 1/2) [32]. Ni/SiO2 reference sample was prepared by the impregnation of the SiO2 support with an aqueous solution of Ni(CH3COO)2 followed by the subsequent drying and calcination at 500 °C to obtain oxide precursor [32]. 2.3 Catalyst characterization The Ni and P content was determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) on an Optima 4300 DV instrument (Perkin Elmer). Powder XRD patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using CuKa radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Textural characteristics were determined from low-temperature nitrogen adsorption isotherms on a Micromeritics ASAP® 2400 analyzer. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were carried out using a JEM-2010 electron microscope (JEOL). The temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was carried out using a Chemosorb apparatus (Neosib). The sample (100 mg) was pre-heated at 200 °C under argon flow for 30 min; thereafter, it was heated at a rate of 10 °C min–1 in a flow containing 9.7 vol% H2 in Ar. H2 consumption was detected by TCD detector. The acidic properties of the samples were analyzed by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) using an Autosorb-1 apparatus (Quantachrome Instruments) in the temperature range from 100 to 500 °C. 2.4 General procedure for reductive amination of EL The catalytic experiments were carried out using fixed-bed continuous flow reactor (inner diameter 9 mm and total length 265 mm). The catalyst precursor (750 mg) was diluted with silicon carbide (fraction of 0.2–0.3 mm) in a ratio of 1:3 and placed in the reactor between two layers of SiC. Before the experiments, the precursor was reduced in situ in H2 flow (100 mL min−1) at the ambient pressure. The samples were heated to 600 °C (for Ni2P/SiO2) or to 400 °C (for Ni/SiO2) at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 and kept at the reduction temperature for 1 h or 2 h, respectively [32–34]. After pre-reduction of the catalyst, the reactor was cooled to the reaction temperature and solvent was supplied into the reactor by a high-pressure pump (Gilson 305). The solvent was then changed to the reaction mixture containing ethyl levulinate (0.04 M) and primary amine (0.041 M). This point in time was chosen as the starting point of the experiment. The reaction was usually performed at temperature of 170 °C, total pressure of 10–20 bar, liquid flow rate (V) of 20–30 mL h − 1 and hydrogen flow rate (V H2) of 30 mL min−1 using n-decane as an internal standard. The first sample of liquid products was collected 2 h after feeding of the substrate; the following samples were taken every 30 min for 2 h. The performance of the catalysts was evaluated by averaging three samples taken in the interval 3–4 h after the start of the experiment. The composition of the reaction products was determined by gas chromatography (Agilent 6890 N instrument with a HP 1-MS capillary column 30 m × 0.32 mm × 1.00 μm). The conversion, selectivity and yield were calculated based on ethyl levulinate. The identification of the products was performed by GC–MS (Agilent 7000B Triple Quad System). Evaluation of the response factors for the reaction products (Supplementary Material) made it possible to conclude that the material balance between the inlet and outlet streams exceeds 97% during all tests using toluene as a solvent. 3 Results and discussion The Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst containing 6.3 wt% Ni and 5.8 wt% P was prepared in accordance with the previously developed procedure: SiO2 grains were impregnated with aqueous solutions of Ni(CH3COO)2 and (NH4)2HPO4 followed by drying, calcination and reduction in hydrogen flow at 600 °C [32,33]. BET surface area of the catalyst (199 m2 g–1) is lower than SBET of the SiO2 support due to partial blockage of the pores by active component. XRD patterns of Ni2P/SiO2 (Fig. 1 ) show characteristic signals of Ni2P phase (2θ = 40.7°, 44.5°, 47.3°, and 54.1°, JCPDS #03–0953). Fig. S1 shows the H2-TPR profile of Ni2P/SiO2. H2 consumption starts only at temperatures ∼600 °C that corresponds to reduction of Ni phosphates to phosphides. According to TEM data, the Ni2P/SiO2 sample contained mainly nickel phosphide particles with a diameter of 1.5–5 nm (Fig. S2). In addition, a small fraction of larger particles (5–25 nm) is detected. NH3-TPD data showed that Ni2P/SiO2 sample has a larger number of acid sites as compared to the initial silica. NH3-TPD curves of SiO2 support and Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst have a maximum at 231–250 °C (Fig. S3). This signal corresponds to the weak acid sites. There is also a broad overlapping signal at 250–400 °C which is attributed to the middle strength acid sites [34]. The catalytic properties of Ni2P/SiO2 were studied in the reductive amination of EL with n-hexylamine (HA) under continuous-flow conditions. A fresh portion of the catalyst was used in each test and the reduction of catalyst was performed immediately before the experiment, as the in-situ reduced Ni2P/SiO2 sample was shown to provide higher activity in comparison with the catalyst prepared in accordance with the widespread method, including ex-situ reduction in the separate vessel, passivation, transfer to the reactor and re-activation in hydrogen flow [35]. It was shown that Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst provides the formation of N-hexyl-5-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (HMP) with selectivity of 94% at the 96% conversion of EL in toluene at 170 °C, 20 bar, 30 mL h − 1 liquid flow rate and 30 mL min−1 hydrogen flow rate (Table 1 , entry 1). In addition to HMP, ethyl 4-(hexylimino)pentanoate (EHP), γ-valerolactone (GVL), unsaturated N-hexyl-5-methyl-2-pyrrolidones (UHPs), and ethanol were observed among the reaction products. This allows us to conclude that the conversion of intermediate imine (EHP) to HMP can proceed via two routes: 1) through EHP hydrogenation to ethyl 4-(hexylamino)pentanoate followed by cyclization to HMP or 2) through the imine-enamine equilibrium with the subsequent elimination of EtOH to UHPs, which are then hydrogenated to target product [7,16,36]. Simultaneously, hydrogenation of EL to ethyl 4-hydroxypentanoate followed by cyclization gives GVL in a side reaction. The proposed mechanism for reductive amination of EL is shown in Scheme 1 . The solvent effect on the performance of Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst was studied. The use of methanol and isopropanol instead of toluene led to a drastic decrease in HMP yield due to alkylation of HA with alcohols (Table 1, entries 2 and 3). Simultaneously, high conversion of EL to GVL was observed. In addition, reductive amination of EL using GVL as a solvent occurred with much lower EL conversion and the target product yield did not exceed 52% (Table 1, entries 4). Therefore, subsequent catalytic tests were carried out in toluene. Increasing the hydrogen flow rate to 60 mL min−1 at a constant liquid flow rate, temperature and total pressure does not affect the HMP yield (Table 1, entries 1 and 5). At the same time, a decrease in the H2 flow from 30 to 15 mL min−1 results in a decline in the yield to 87% (Table 1, entries 1 and 6). Meanwhile, the pressure change in the interval from 10 to 30 bar shows no significant effect on the HMP yield (Table 1, entries 1, 7 and 8). An increase of the contact time by reducing the liquid flow rate from 30 to 20 mL h − 1 increases the yield of HMP from 92 to 94% (Table 1, entries 8 and 9), while the opposite trend is observed with a decrease of the catalyst loading (Table 1, entries 1 and 10). In addition, raising the temperature to 180 °C reduces the selectivity towards HMP (Table 1, entries 10 and 11) due to an increase in the rate of GVL formation. It is important to note that preliminary condensation of EL with HA at room temperature under solvent-free conditions, leading to the formation of imine in a yield of ∼67% [13], has no effect on the HMP yield (Table 1, entries 10 and 12). The time-dependent analysis of EHP, EL and HA concentration after dilution of the preliminary mixed EL and HA with toluene showed that EHP decomposes with the formation of EL and HA at room temperature (Fig. S4). SiO2-supported nickel catalyst containing 6.8 wt% Ni provides the similar EL conversion as compared with Ni2P/SiO2, but the selectivity is lower due to the formation of a larger amount of GVL (Table 1, entries 13 and 14). Under optimized reaction conditions, reductive amination of EL with HA over 6.8% Ni/SiO2 catalyst occurs with the HMP yield of 83%. In addition, the reduction of C = O, C = N and C = C double bonds in the absence of catalyst was not observed (Table 1, entry 15). The scope of the reaction was explored with structurally different primary amines in toluene under optimized reaction conditions (170 °C, 10 bar, H2 flow rate of 30 mL min−1, liquid flow rate of 20 mL h − 1). n-Butylamine reacts with EL to form N‑butyl‑5-methyl-2-pyrrolidone in a yield of 83% (Table 2 , entries 1 and 2). The lower selectivity to pyrrolidone is probably explained by the evaporation of low-boiling butylamine (boiling point of 78 °C) from the initial reaction mixture. In this regard, an increase in the concentration of butylamine to 0.05 M enhances the yield of the target product to 91% (Table 2, entry 3). In contrast to aliphatic amines, aniline and p-toluidine give a moderate yield of corresponding pyrrolidone (67% and 70%) over Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst (Table 2, entries 4 and 5) that is explained by the much weaker nucleophilic properties of an aromatic amine. Nitro compounds were proposed as substitutes for primary amines in reductive amination of LA (EL) [9,18,23]. For this reason, we investigated the reaction between EL and 1-nitropropane over the Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst in presence of H2. 1-Nitropropane quantitatively hydrogenated into n-propylamine, which subsequently reacts with EL affording N-propyl-5-methyl-2-pyrrolidone with the yield of 41% at EL conversion of 92% (Table 2, entry 6). An increase in the reaction temperature has no significant effect on the yield of the target product (Table 2, entry 7). Thus, the observed yield of pyrrolidone is much lower than the results obtained with primary aliphatic amines. The time-dependent study of the reductive amination of EL with HA over Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst showed that the EL conversion and HMP yield remained unchanged for 6 h (Fig. S5). The spent catalyst was investigated by AAS and XRD. It was found that the Ni content did not change noticeably after the reaction. The XRD pattern of the spent catalyst contains peaks associated with Ni2P phase (Fig. 1). These results allow us to conclude that the destruction of the catalyst structure does not occur during the reaction. After completion of the reaction, the spent catalyst can be reused without loss of HMP yield. For this, the catalytic reactor was washed with toluene flow (60 mL h − 1) for an hour, cooled to room temperature and the catalyst was stored under hydrogen for further use. Conclusions In summary, inexpensive and easily prepared SiO2-supported nickel phosphide is the efficient catalyst for reductive amination of ethyl levulinate with alkylamines to N-alkyl-5-methyl-2-pyrrolidones in a flow reactor. The 6.3% Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst provides the formation of N-alkyl-5-methyl-2-pyrrolidone with the yield up to 94% in toluene at 170 °С using molecular hydrogen as a reducing agent. At the same time, aromatic amines and 1-nitropropane give a lower yield of the corresponding pyrrolidones. The use of alcohols or γ-valerolactone instead of toluene leads to a sharp decrease in the target product yield. Author statement Alexey L. Nuzhdin: Conceptualization, Writing - Review & Editing.

Reductive amination of alkyl levulinates derived from biomass feedstock is a promising method for production of these compounds. In the present work, N-alkyl-5-methyl-2-pyrrolidones were obtained in excellent yields by reductive amination of ethyl levulinate with alkylamines over SiO2-supported nickel phosphide in a flow reactor using molecular hydrogen as a reducing agent. At the same time, aromatic amines and 1-nitropropane give a lower yield of the corresponding pyrrolidones. The influence of the solvent nature, temperature, pressure, hydrogen and liquid flow rates on the catalyst performance was studied.",
