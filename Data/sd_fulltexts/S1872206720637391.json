Herein, an etching-assisted synthesis approach was developed to integrate highly active NiFe2O4 nanoparticles with a robust and active NiOOH scaffold directly on commercial stainless steel. A precise selenization strategy was then introduced to achieve selective Se doping of NiFe2O4 to further enhance its intrinsic OER activity while maintaining a three-dimensional NiOOH nanosheet array as a robust scaffold for prompt mass transfer and gas evolution. The resulting NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH electrode exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity with low overpotentials of 153 and 259 mV to deliver benchmark current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm−2, respectively. More importantly, the catalyst exhibited remarkable durability at a stable current output of 100 mA cm−2 for hundreds of hours. These findings may open up opportunities for exploring efficient and robust electrocatalysts for scalable hydrogen production with practical materials. Graphical Abstract The rational fabrication of selectively Se-doped NiFe2O4 nanoparticles on active NiOOH nanosheet arrays enables efficient and robust OER electrocatalysts for scalable hydrogen production with commercial stainless steel. Keywords Water oxidation Selective selenization NiFe2O4 NiOOH Heterostructure 1 Introduction Hydrogen has attracted increasing attention because of its essential role in several important industrial processes, particularly as a new-style energy carrier in energy conversion [1–3]. Compared with reforming fossil fuels, water splitting using renewable energy resources such as solar and hydropower is a promising alternative method for hydrogen production without CO2 emissions [4]. Because of the sluggish kinetics involving a four-electron process, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the efficiency-limiting step for water splitting and other energy devices such as fuel cells and metal-air batteries [5,6]. Although noble metal-based catalysts such as iridium and ruthenium oxides (IrO2 and RuO2) have shown high activity for OER [7,8], their high cost and scarcity impede their practical application, which calls for the development of efficient, nonprecious-metal electrocatalysts. Although enormous efforts have been made to explore cost-effective electrocatalysts, including oxides, oxyhydroxides, and chalcogenides, it is still challenging to develop highly active catalysts while meeting durability requirements [9–18]. Recently, metal sulfides or selenides have been reported as efficient catalysts for OER because they can evolve into S- or Se-doped oxides and oxyhydroxides as highly active sites under the strong oxidative conditions of OER [19,20]. Unfortunately, such evolution and conversion processes usually lead to severe structural distortion and collapse, causing inevitable stability issues. Therefore, the rational design of one unit with a robust scaffold decorated with highly efficient active sites may be an effective way to create high-performance OER catalysts. In general, oxyhydroxides exhibit remarkable stability during OER owing to their “self-healing” process [21,22]. For example, NiOOH has been considered the true catalytic active site for Ni(OH)2, NiSe, and NiS electrocatalysts, although its OER activity needs to be further improved [18,23]. NiFe2O4 with an inverse-spinel-structure is regarded as a more active electrocatalyst for OER because of its good conductivity and appropriate adsorption/desorption of intermediate species of OER [24–26]. In particular, the vulcanization or selenization of NiFe2O4 would further enhance its electrocatalytic activity for OER [19]. Therefore, the combination of active NiOOH as a robust scaffold and NiFe2O4 as the active site, followed by the precise selenization of NiFe2O4, would be a good option to create the abovementioned heterostructures as highly efficient OER catalysts. However, the energy difference between the two phases, which is mainly determined by temperature and ligand molecules, makes it challenging to fabricate heterostructures of NiOOH and NiFe2O4 and, needless to say, to carry out the subsequent selective selenization. Herein, we developed a one-step KOH etching-assisted method for the direct fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) NiFe2O4/NiOOH heterostructures on a commercial stainless-steel mesh consisting of NiOOH nanosheet arrays decorated by NiFe2O4 nanocrystals. The precise selenization of NiFe2O4 into NiFe2O4−x Se x was further achieved to create highly active Se-doped catalytic sites while keeping the 3D NiOOH nanosheet array intact as a robust scaffold, endowing the heterostructure electrode with remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability for OER. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals and materials A stainless-steel mesh was purchased from Wuxi Xinmeihui Metal Technology Co., Ltd. Sodium borohydride, potassium hydroxide, ethanol, and acetone were obtained from the National Reagent Company. Se powder, commercial RuO2, and Nafion™ (5 wt%) were provided by Sigma-Aldrich. Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm at 25 °C) was used for all the experiments. All reagents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. 2.2 Preparation of NiFe2O4/NiOOH heterostructures A stainless-steel mesh containing several inherent transition metal elements (Fe, Ni, Mn), which are potentially catalytically active, was selected as the back electrode and the metal source for the growth of NiFe2O4/NiOOH heterostructures owing to its excellent conductivity and 3D structure, allowing the electrolyte to fully contact the surface of the catalyst and enable fast mass transfer. A piece of stainless-steel mesh (1 × 3 cm, 600 mesh) was ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, HCl, distilled water, and ethanol successively for 30 min and then kept in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 24 h. Typically, the pretreated stainless steel was transferred to a 50 mL autoclave containing 6 M KOH solution and maintained at 160 °C for 16 h. The KOH concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction duration were varied to control the morphology and composition of the products. Bare NiOOH nanosheets were obtained at 150 °C in 6 M KOH, and bare NiFe2O4 nanoparticles were formed at 200 °C in 12 M KOH. 2.3 Selenization of NiFe2O4/NiOOH heterostructures The NaHSe solution was prepared by adding Se powder (65 mg) to deionized water (30 mL) containing NaBH4 (65 mg) under N2 flow while stirring. In a typical process, the solution was transferred to a 50-mL autoclave with a piece of NiFe2O4/NiOOH on stainless steel and maintained at 180 °C for 24 h in an oven. For different degrees of selenization, samples were prepared using different hydrothermal times (16 h, 24 h). For comparison, samples of bare NiFe2O4 were selenized under the same selenization conditions. The final product was defined as NiFe2O4−x Se x . 2.4 Materials characterization The crystal structure was studied by X-ray power diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker D8 Advance Power X-ray diffractometer at 40 kV and 40 mA for monochromatized Cu Kα (λ = 0.15406 nm). The morphology, composition, and structure were studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI S-4800) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) with a JEOL JEM 2100 microscope operating at 200 kV. Raman spectroscopy was performed on a confocal microscopic Raman spectrometer (HORIBA LabRAM HR Evolution) with an excitation laser at 532 nm and a low laser power of 1 mW. The contact angles were measured under ambient conditions on a JC2000D optical contact angle measuring device. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250 instrument using 200 W monochromatic Al Kα radiation. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis was carried out using a Thermo iCAP 7200 ICP-OES instrument. The composition of the stainless-steel mesh was measured using an electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA-1720). 2.5 Electrochemical measurements All electrochemical measurements were performed using a standard three-electrode cell on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Shanghai Chen Hua Instruments Co., China), with a platinum plate as the counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl (3.3 M KCl) electrode as the reference electrode. The active area of the prepared electrodes for electrochemical tests was 1 × 1 cm. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves for all the electrocatalysts were recorded after 20 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) until a stable CV curve was obtained. To exclude the effect of the reference electrode in the alkali solution, the performance of NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH was evaluated with a Hg/HgO electrode as the reference electrode, and nearly identical LSV curves were obtained (Fig. S1), confirming its outstanding electrocatalytic activity. LSV curves were recorded in a 1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 without iR-correction. Because NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH exhibited a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 1.41 V vs. RHE, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests of all catalysts were carried out at the same potential (1.41 V vs. RHE) over a frequency range of 0.01–105 Hz and an AC amplitude of 5 mV in 1 M KOH to study the charge transfer resistance and solution resistance. The electrochemical active surface areas (ECSAs) were obtained via a series of CV measurements at various scan rates (20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 mV s−1) in a potential window of 0.8–0.9 V vs. RHE. The 6000-cycle stability test was carried out at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The Faraday efficiency test of NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH was carried out at an overpotential of 330 mV vs. RHE. To exclude the influence of ECSA on performance comparisons, the OER curves were normalized by the ECSAs. The ECSA-normalized current density for the as-prepared catalysts was calculated as follows: ECSA-normalized current density = current density × C s/C dl where C s is the specific capacitance. Here, 0.04 mF cm−2 was adopted as the value of C s based on previously reported OER catalysts in alkaline solution [27], and C dl is the electrochemical double-layer capacitance value of different electrocatalysts. For comparison, ~5 mg of commercial RuO2 was ultrasonically dispersed in a mixture of 550 μL ethanol, 450 μL water, and 50 μL of 5% Nafion™. The dispersion (40 μL) was transferred onto a stainless-steel substrate for electrochemical measurements. The RuO2 loading was ~0.2 mg cm−2. 2.6 Density functional theory calculation Geometry optimization and frequency analysis of the constructed systems were carried out using density functional theory (DFT) implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP). The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was employed to model the electronic exchange-correlation energy. Projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudo-potentials were adopted to describe the ionic cores. The energy cutoff and Gaussian smearing were set to 600 and 0.05 eV, respectively. The convergence criteria for self-consistent field and geometry optimization were set to 10−7 eV and 0.01 eV/Å, respectively. The DFT+U method was used to describe the 3d orbitals of Fe and Ni. The k-point sampling of the Brillouin zone was obtained using a 4 × 4 × 1 grid. The mechanisms employed for OER are listed below: (1) OH− + * → OH* + e− (2) OH* + OH− → O* + H2O (l) + e− (3) O* + OH− → OOH* + e− (4) OOH* + OH− → O2 (g) + H2O (l) + e− + * The Gibbs free-energy change of the elementary steps was calculated as follows: (5) ΔG = ΔE + ΔZPE − TΔS + ∫CpdT where ΔE, ΔZPE, ΔS, and ∫CpdT are the reaction energies obtained in the geometry optimization, the zero-point energy correction, the entropy change, and the free-energy correction obtained in the frequency analysis, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Preparation and characterization of NiFe2O4−xSex/NiOOH hybrid catalyst In a typical experiment, a commercial 304 stainless-steel (SS) mesh with the morphology and composition shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1, respectively, were treated in a KOH solution at 160 °C to grow NiFe2O4/NiOOH heterostructures. NiFe2O4 was then partially selenized while keeping NiOOH unchanged via a hydrothermal process to obtain NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH. The details are presented in the experimental section. A possible formation mechanism is proposed in Fig. 1(a) . In general, Fe2+ and Ni2+ were formed from the stainless-steel substrate during alkali etching and then oxidized. Initially, NiOOH nucleated and grew gradually to form nanosheets because of the low critical concentration of Ni3+. With extended reaction time, the level of Fe3+ approached the critical concentration and Fe3+ reacted with Ni2+ to form NiFe2O4 nanoparticles, thus generating NiOOH/NiFe2O4 heterostructures. Therefore, the ratio of the two phases can be readily controlled by tuning the leaching rates of Fe and Ni ions via the temperature and concentration of OH−. In two extreme cases, pure NiOOH nanosheets were obtained at 150 °C in 6 M KOH, and pure NiFe2O4 nanocrystals were formed at 200 °C in 12 M KOH (Fig. S3). The well-defined heterostructures can be obtained in a narrow temperature window of approximately 160 °C. The XRD results (Fig. S4) suggested that the higher temperature and concentration of KOH were favorable for the formation of NiFe2O4, with a color change from pale yellow to black (140 to 180 °C, Fig. S5). ICP analysis (Table S2) of the etching solution after the reaction revealed that the mass fraction of Fe was much higher than that in stainless steel. The pale yellow color of the reaction solution was due to the high concentration of Fe3+ (Fig. S6). The mass fractions of Ni, Cr, and Mn were much lower, supporting the suggested formation mechanism. The etching and recrystallization regulated by the temperature and concentration of KOH were likely responsible for the formation of the NiOOH/NiFe2O4 heterostructures. Typical samples were characterized first by XRD. As depicted in Fig. 1(b), a set of peaks at 30.3°, 35.7°, 57.4°, 63.0°, and 74.5° were observed for the NiFe2O4/NiOOH sample, which corresponded to the (220), (311), (511), (440), and (533) crystallographic planes of cubic NiFe2O4 (JCPDS No. 54-0964), respectively [28]. The diffraction peaks at 43.5°, 50.8°, and 74.7° are attributed to the steel substrate (JCPDS No. 33-0397). This result indicates the formation of NiFe2O4 on stainless steel. No clear peak from NiOOH was observed, probably owing to its low crystallinity. To probe NiOOH species, Raman spectroscopy was performed (Fig. 1(c)). The two main peaks at ~482 and 554 cm−1 can be ascribed to the eg bending vibration and the A1g stretching vibration of Ni–O of NiOOH [29–31], which remained clear after the sample was kept for more than 14 d, suggesting the good stability of NiOOH under ambient conditions (Fig. S7). Two other weak peaks at ~335 and 669 cm−1 can be indexed to the classic Raman vibration of NiFe2O4 [24,32]. The Raman results thus indicated the presence of NiOOH and NiFe2O4. It is noted that two weak peaks at 725 and 786 cm−1 appeared, which can be attributed to Cr–O bonding from the oxidation of Cr impurities in the steel substrate [33,34]. After selenization, all the XRD peaks remained at a slightly reduced intensity, indicating that no crystalline impurities were introduced (Fig. 1(b)). The Raman spectra remained nearly unchanged (Fig. 1(c)), implying that NiOOH did not change during the selenization process. The composition and elemental chemical states of the NiFe2O4/NiOOH heterostructures were further studied by XPS (Figs. 1(d–g) and Fig. S8). The Fe 2p spectrum were fitted with two doublet peaks and two satellite peaks, which shifted to slightly higher energies as compared to those of the steel substrate (Fig. S9). The doublet peaks at 706.7 and 719.8 eV are assigned to metallic Fe from the stainless steel, and the other doublet peaks at higher energies (711.5 and 725.0 eV) are attributed to Fe3+ from NiFe2O4 [24,25]. In contrast, prominent peaks at 855.7 and 856.8 eV corresponding to Ni2+ and Ni3+ correspond well to Ni in NiFe2O4 and NiOOH [14,33]. In the O 1s spectrum, the peak at 531.4 eV corresponds to hydroxides, indicating the formation of NiOOH [14,24]. After selenization, a clear Se signal was observed in the Se 3d XPS spectrum, with peaks at 58.1 and 54.3 eV assigned to Se–O and Se–metal (Se–M), respectively (Fig. 1(g)) [35]. The binding energies of Ni 2p and Fe 2p shifted slightly to lower energies owing to the modulation of Se doping (Figs. 1(d,e)), as N or P-doping has been previously reported [36,37]. The formation of heterostructures is also owing to morphological evolution. After etching, the smooth surface of the stainless steel was covered by 3D heterostructures consisting of nanoparticles with diameters of 200–400 nm and vertical nanosheets with a lateral size of 1–3 μm and a thickness of ~15 nm (Figs. 2(a,b) and Fig. S10). The STEM-EDS elemental mapping results (Fig. S11) corroborated that the nanosheets and nanoparticles were NiOOH and NiFe2O4, respectively. The selective selenization process did not change the product morphology (Fig. 2(c) and Fig. S12). The TEM image confirmed the presence of nanoparticles with diameters of 200–400 nm with darker contrast decorated on the nanosheet (Fig. 2(d)). The lattice fringes of the nanoparticles with a d-spacing of 0.29 nm (Fig. 2(e)) are well indexed to the (220) planes of cubic NiFe2O4, confirming that the nanoparticles were NiFe2O4. No ordered lattice fringe (Fig. 2(f)) was observed from the nanosheet, indicating the amorphous nature of NiOOH. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2(g)) showed no discernible diffraction spots or rings, consistent with the above observations. In the STEM-EDS elemental mapping images, an additional Se signal appeared only in the nanoparticles (Fig. 2(h) and Fig. S13). This result, together with the XRD and Raman results, suggests that NiFe2O4 nanoparticles were partially selenized into NiFe2O4−x Se x , whereas the NiOOH scaffold did not change, probably owing to the different strengths of the Ni–O bond in NiOOH and NiFe2O4, allowing us to achieve selective selenization by controlling the hydrothermal conditions. 3.2 Electrochemical performance of electrocatalysts The OER electrocatalytic activity of the heterostructure electrodes was evaluated using a standard three-electrode system in O2-saturated 1 M KOH. The LSV polarization curves without iR-correction for all samples are presented in Fig. 3(a) to evaluate the performance for the practical application of water splitting for hydrogen production. The undoped NiFe2O4/NiOOH exhibits excellent OER activity with low overpotentials (η) of 259 and 346 mV at current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively, significantly outperforming commercial RuO2 on stainless steel (RuO2/SS, Figs. S14(a,b)). Pure NiFe2O4 and NiOOH samples on SS were prepared in parallel for comparison (Fig. S3). As shown in Fig. 3(a), both NiFe2O4 and NiOOH showed reasonable OER activity, and the former was more active. However, the NiFe2O4/NiOOH heterostructure delivered appreciably enhanced OER activity, as shown by the 49 and 75 mV lower overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 than NiFe2O4 and NiOOH, respectively. This suggests that the present strategy for combining them is effective for improving the OER activity. After selective selenization, the NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH exhibited remarkably enhanced OER activity, with overpotentials of 182 and 267 mV to drive current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively. These values are 77 and 79 mV less than those of undoped NiFe2O4/NiOOH. Slowing the scanning rate from 5 to 1 mV s−1, the OER activity did not change (Fig. S14(c)), indicating its good electrocatalytic kinetics [38]. This improvement can be ascribed to the electronic modulation of Se doping on the catalytic sites to modulate the adsorption/desorption of intermediates [19,20]. This doping effect can be corroborated by control experiments. (1) The pure NiFe2O4 sample was also selenized in parallel under the same conditions. Similarly, the doped NiFe2O4−x Se x exhibited enhanced OER activity after Se doping (Fig. S15). (2) With the present doping strategy, the Se dopant content can be easily tuned by varying the reaction time. As shown in Fig. S16, the OER activity increased appreciably as the amount of Se doping increased. Therefore, it is clear that the significantly improved OER activity is owing to the selective Se doping of NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH. It should be noted that if both NiFe2O4 and NiOOH are selenized via a gas-phase method, the NiOOH scaffold becomes unstable and starts to peel off during OER. This suggests the necessity of precise selenization of NiFe2O4 while keeping NiOOH intact. To assess the electrocatalytic kinetics, Tafel analyses of various catalysts were derived from their LSV polarization curves. NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH exhibited the smallest Tafel slope (42.5 mV dec−1), substantially smaller than those of NiFe2O4/NiOOH (82.4 mV dec−1) and RuO2/SS (106.2 mV dec−1) (Fig. 3(b) and Fig. S14(b)), indicating that it had the fastest kinetics. To compare the OER activity of the NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH heterostructure with those of reported electrocatalysts, iR-correction was applied to evaluate the present NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH electrode. As shown in Fig. 3(a), a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm−2 was achieved at an ultralow overpotential of 153 mV. Of more interest, it delivered an industrial-level current density of 500 mA cm−2 at an extremely low overpotential of 259 mV. The Tafel slope after iR-correction was reduced to 22.2 mV dec−1. These results outperformed those of most state-of-the-art analogs (Fig. 3(c) and Table S3) [35,39–44]. Interestingly, the NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH electrode exhibited pH-dependent OER activity (Fig. S17), suggesting that lattice oxygens may also have taken part in the OER process [45,46]. To determine whether the recorded current was truly from the OER process, the Faraday efficiency was evaluated by measuring the evolved oxygen gas volumes and comparing them with theoretical values. As shown in Fig. 3(d), the experimental results for NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH agreed well with the theoretical analysis, giving a Faraday efficiency of over 98%. This suggests that the observed current and gas originated from the OER rather than from other processes. Chronoamperometric experiments were then performed at applied potentials of 1.41 and 1.56 V (vs. RHE) to evaluate the electrocatalytic stability of NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH. Fig. 3(e) shows that NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH delivered steady current densities of approximately 10 and 100 mA cm−2 for hundreds of hours, indicating its impressive durability. Furthermore, multi-step chronoamperometric measurements suggested that NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH can steadily deliver current densities up to hundreds of mA cm−2 (Fig. 3(f)). LSV measurements indicated that no detectable degradation was observed after 6000 cycles (Fig. S18). After the stability test, the catalyst was systematically characterized. SEM images showed that the morphology and structure of NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH were well preserved after the test (Fig. S19). The XRD pattern (Fig. S20) still displayed clear diffraction signals from the cubic NiFe2O4. These results corroborate the superior stability of NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH during OER. XPS analyses indicated that the Fe3+, Ni2+, and Ni3+ signals showed negligible changes before and after the test (Fig. S21). It is noted that the Cr signal, which was the main impurity in the stainless-steel substrate, completely disappeared after the test (Fig. S21(c) and Table S4). To identify the effect of chromium content on the OER activity of NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH, the chromium content was measured during the stability test. The chromium content decreased from 6.65% to 0.76% within 24 h and approached 0.13% after 96 h (Table S5 and Fig. S22) while the performance of NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH remained unchanged (Fig. S23), suggesting that chromium doping or leaching had a negligible effect on its electrocatalytic activity for OER [38]. However, the effect of Cr may be traded off by the formation of more (oxy)hydroxide species to some extent. In the Se 3d spectra (Fig. S21(d)), the peak at 54.3 eV assigned to the Cr–Se bond completely disappeared after long-term testing, and thus the Se content decreased from 8.3% to ~2%, consistent with previous reports [35,47]. In addition, the peak ascribed to Se–Fe or Se–Ni shifted from 55.1 to 55.7 eV after long-term testing, likely owing to partial oxidation, which is consistent with the minor broad peak at 58.1 eV attributed to Se–O [35]. Similar to Cr, the portion of Se bonded with Cr may have had a negligible contribution to the OER activity, and only the portion of Se bonded with Ni or Fe in NiFe2O4 had a positive effect on the electrocatalytic process by affecting the adsorption/desorption of intermediates and the interaction between Ni and Fe, which is generally favorable for OER. In contrast, the Mn content remained nearly unchanged. 3.3 Mechanism analysis To further understand the enhanced OER activity by selective Se doping, the charge transfer process, the ECSA, and the surface wettability were studied for samples with and without Se doping. EIS analyses (Fig. 4(a) and Table S6) indicated that the solution resistance (R s) did not change significantly by Se doping (1.59 vs. 1.69 Ω). However, the charge transfer resistance (R ct) for NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH (4.29 Ω) was reduced five and nine times compared with NiFe2O4/NiOOH (22.90 Ω) and RuO2/SS (38.40 Ω), respectively. This suggests that Se doping significantly enhanced the charge transport ability and thus accelerated the catalytic process. The double-layer capacitance (C dl, Fig. S24) analyses via CV at different scan rates (Fig. S25) illustrated that NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH had a larger ECSA (37.50 mF cm−2) than NiFe2O4/NiOOH (32.75 mF cm−2) and RuO2/SS (23.60 mF cm−2). In view of their similar morphologies, this difference means that selective Se doping created new active sites such as defects and/or remarkably enhanced the intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites [48,49]. To compare the intrinsic activity before and after Se doping, the LSV curves were normalized by the ECSAs. As shown in Fig. 4(b), NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH still showed much better OER activity than NiFe2O4/NiOOH and RuO2/SS, even after ECSA normalization, indicating that Se doping enhanced the intrinsic OER activity. The surface wettability was then investigated by measuring the contact angle between the electrolyte and the electrocatalyst in view of its important role in mass transfer [50]. As shown in Figs. 4(c,d), both NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH and NiFe2O4/ NiOOH showed superhydrophilic surfaces. However, the droplet completely spread out on the former within 20 ms, whereas it could be detected for as long as 50 ms on the latter. This reveals that selective selenization delivered a more hydrophilic surface, which is beneficial for mass transfer. Moreover, a comparison with the steel substrate, which had a contact angle of 116.34° (Fig. S26), suggests the importance of 3D heterostructures in improving surface wettability. To obtain deeper insight into the effect of Se doping on the OER activity, DFT simulations were performed to analyze the modulation of Se doping on the electronic structure and local coordination environment of NiFe2O4. Two possible Se-doped crystalline structural models were constructed, as shown in Fig. 5(a) . The intermediates, including OH*, O*, and OOH*, were constructed on the basis of the optimized structures (Fig. S27). The simulation results are presented in Table S7. As shown in Fig. 5(b) and Table S8, the rate-limiting step for undoped NiFe2O4 is the step *OOH to O2 in terms of the largest energy barrier (3.64 eV). In contrast, the rate-limiting step is the formation of OOH* from O* after Se doping, as is commonly observed [6,49]. Such a difference may be caused by structural distortion on the NiFe2O4 surface owing to Se doping. As shown in Fig. S28, the *OOH species was bound strongly with Fe and Ni on the surface of NiFe2O4, whereas this interaction was significantly reduced because of the evident steric hindrance introduced by Se doping. More importantly, the energy barriers were substantially reduced to 2.11 eV for NiFe2O4−x Se x −1 and 2.05 eV for NiFe2O4−x Se x −2, leading to a significant reduction in overpotentials from 2.28 V for undoped NiFe2O4 to 0.76 and 0.68 V, respectively. This observation is in good agreement with the experimental results, rationalizing the significant enhancement of Se doping on OER. 4 Conclusions In summary, NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH on stainless steel with a unique 3D heterostructure of Se-doped NiFe2O4 nanocrystals decorated on a vertically aligned NiOOH nanosheet scaffold was rationally developed via direct alkaline etching of the substrate followed by facile precise solution selenization. Systematic experiments indicated that integrating NiFe2O4 nanocrystals with the NiOOH nanosheet scaffold appreciably enhanced the OER electrocatalytic activity. The selective selenization of NiFe2O4 further significantly promoted the OER activity by electronic modulation of the active centers. Together with improved surface wettability and mass transfer from 3D heterostructures, these features enabled NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH to achieve an industrial-level OER current density of 500 mA cm−2 at an ultralow overpotential of 259 mV with a small Tafel slope of 22.2 mV dec−1. This performance was better than those of state-of-the-art OER catalysts. More importantly, the NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH catalyst showed outstanding durability in terms of steady current output at various current densities up to hundreds of mA cm−2. These results suggest that the present strategy provides a new avenue to advance the development of high-efficiency and scalable electrocatalysts for cost-effective hydrogen production from water splitting.

        "dc:description": "There remains a challenge in designing electrocatalysts for water oxidation to create highly efficient catalytic sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) while maintaining their robustness at large outputs. Herein, an etching-assisted synthesis approach was developed to integrate highly active NiFe2O4 nanoparticles with a robust and active NiOOH scaffold directly on commercial stainless steel. A precise selenization strategy was then introduced to achieve selective Se doping of NiFe2O4 to further enhance its intrinsic OER activity while maintaining a three-dimensional NiOOH nanosheet array as a robust scaffold for prompt mass transfer and gas evolution. The resulting NiFe2O4−x Se x /NiOOH electrode exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity with low overpotentials of 153 and 259 mV to deliver benchmark current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm−2, respectively. More importantly, the catalyst exhibited remarkable durability at a stable current output of 100 mA cm−2 for hundreds of hours. These findings may open up opportunities for exploring efficient and robust electrocatalysts for scalable hydrogen production with practical materials.",
