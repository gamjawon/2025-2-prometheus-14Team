Graphical abstract Cyclotrimerization of acetylene catalyzed by Grubbs ruthenium catalysts can proceed through two pathways. Pathway 1 is the metathesis pathway and involves a four membered metallacycle intermediate and pathway 2 is non-metathesis pathway and has a five membered metallacycle intermediate. Cyclotrimerization of acetylene by Grubbs first and second generation CC bond metathesis catalysts has been attempted by experimentalists with limited success and lack of reliable information about the mechanism of the reaction hinders further progress in the development of efficient catalysts. Herein, we describe a systematic density functional theory study on the probable mechanisms of this reaction and show that it proceeds through either a fully metathesis pathway (pathway 1) or through an alternate non-metathesis pathway (pathway 2). Pathway 1 consists of four metathesis steps characterized by the formation of metallacyclobutene-like intermediate in each step while pathway 2 passes through a metallacyclopentadiene intermediate. In metathesis pathway, the final ring closing metathesis step for benzene formation competes with another cross metathesis propagation step towards polyene chain expansion. Pathways 1 and 2 show a highly exothermic ∼120kcal/mol reaction profile due to the tremendous energy gain in converting acetylene triple bonds to aromatic bonds. The reaction is highly influenced by the choice of ligands in the catalyst design, particularly, by reducing the steric influence of ligands, cyclotrimerization of acetylene to benzene appears as a feasible process by Grubbs-type catalysts. Keywords Cyclotrimerization reaction Density functional theory Enyne metathesis Grubbs catalyst 1 Introduction Transition metal mediated cyclotrimerization of alkynes is a direct and atom economic way for the synthesis of carbocycles. Reppe et al. were the first to show such a reaction using Ni catalyst [1]. Later many transition metal atoms and complexes have been reported for catalytic activity [2–11], and among them, Co and Rh complexes are found to be the most efficient catalysts [12–16]. Yamamoto and co-workers tried ruthenium-based catalysts such as i, [CpRuCl(cod)] (cp=cyclopentadiene, cod=1,5-cyclooctadiene) in the cyclotrimerization reaction of 1,6-diyne with alkenes, alkynes and nitriles for the synthesis of benzenoid and heterocycle compounds [17–27]. The ‘cod’ ligand in the catalyst is easily replaceable by the alkynes, and the bulky Cp is used as a control ligand for the chemo and regioselectivity. The intermolecular alkyne cyclotrimerization in an aqueous medium is also recently achieved by Sorkau et al. [28] with a Ru(IV) dimer catalyst ii, [{Ru(η3:η3-C10H16)(μ-Cl)Cl}2] (Fig. 1 ). Grubbs ruthenium catalysts, widely used in olefin metathesis reaction [29–33], have been found to catalyze other non- metathesis reactions such as olefin isomerization [34,35]. Peters and Blechert reported that the Grubbs first generation catalyst iii, [X2Cl2RuCHPh] (X=tricyclohexylphosphine) promotes intra-molecular cyclotrimerization of triynes to benzene derivatives. They proposed a mechanism consisting four metathesis steps viz. three cross metathesis (CM) followed by a ring closing metathesis (RCM) for the reaction (Scheme 1 ) [36]. Later Das and Roy used Grubbs first generation catalysts for the intermolecular cyclotrimerization of alkynes for the synthesis of carbohydrate derivatives [37]. Hoven et al. used iii in the synthesis of amino acid derivatives from appropriately substituted triynes [38]. Witulski et al. reported that iii could also catalyze the alkyne cyclotrimerization to synthesize indoline derivatives and suggested that the reaction may proceed through a cascade of metathesis steps [39]. Later Grubbs second generation and Grubbs-Hoveyda catalysts also found to be useful in the cyclotrimerization reaction of alkynes with various substrates such as alkynes, nitriles and alkenes [36,37,40,41]. Mechanism described in Scheme 1 (first three CM steps) can be compared with that of enyne metathesis which involves the bond reorganization between an alkene and an alkyne, resulting in a conjugated 1,3-diene system [42–47]. Experimental and theoretical studies discussing enyne metathesis mechanism reported a η3-vinyl carbene complex intermediate in the course of the reaction [43,48,49]. The mechanism proposed by Peters and Blechert is fundamentally very different from the typically used and widely accepted trimerization pathway given in Scheme 2 . Theoretical studies on the mechanism of cyclotrimerization catalyzed by Co, Ru, Ir complexes have shown that a bis-alkyne complex formed in the reaction undergoes CC bond coupling to yield the key metallacyclopentadiene intermediate [8,50–54]. Coordination of a third alkyne to this intermediate and subsequent CC bond coupling leads to the formation of a bicyclic ring composed of five and four membered rings. The bicyclic system changes to a seven memberd metallacycle by the cleavage of the central metal-carbon bond. Further rearrangement involving a CC coupling reaction results in the formation of the benzene complex. Cyclotrimerization of acetylene to benzene is an attractive reaction path for the synthesis of benzene and its derivatives. Grubbs ruthenium complex offers a good catalyst choice for cyclotrimerization as it is well-known for the stability and functional group tolerance. It is known that under strong reaction condition, the Grubbs catalyst undergoes catalyst modification and the modified system is active for non-metathesis reaction [55]. Mol and co-workers attempted to decompose ruthenium carbene based complexes using primary alcohols to get a highly active ruthenium hydride system [56,57]. Van Rensburg et al. using DFT techniques suggested a substrate induced decomposition mechanism for Grubbs ruthenium carbene catalysts [58]. They proposed a β hydride transfer from the ruthenacyclobutane intermediate. Grubbs group reported the thermal decomposition of phosponium based Grubbs catalyst to a dinuclear ruthenium hydride complex [59]. They proposed that the dissociated phosphine ligand can attack the nucleophilic methylidene center of the catalyst to form a ruthenium hydride complex [59]. Grubbs group proposed yet another decomposition path involving a double CH bond activation for second generation catalyst with benzylidene ligand [60] which was later theoretically supported by Mathew et al., using DFT techniques [61]. Vehlow et al. reported deactivation pathway for Grubbs-Hoveyda type complexes with alkoxy benzylidene ligands. Their report suggested that Grubbs-Hoveyda type complexes with N-aryl substituted NHC ligands, lacking steric hindrance at the ortho position of the arene ligand, can give rise to intra-molecular CH insertion. This insertion leads to metathesis-inactive ruthenium complexes [62]. Recently Castells et al. suggested the formation of a non-carbenic species from Hoveyda–Grubbs catalyst under strong reaction condition which catalyzes the cyclotrimerization of alkynes and nitriles to pyridine [55,63–65]. Same group also studied the reaction between a diyne and an alkene leading to cyclohexadiene derivatives in presence of Grubbs-Hoveyda catalyst and proposed that a metathesis pathway similar to Scheme 1 can be in competition with a non-metathesis pathway similar to that in Scheme 2 and the preference of any of these pathways could depend on the substrates and reaction conditions [66]. In the present study, we investigate the possibility of acetylene cyclotrimerization using Grubbs first and second generation catalysts. The reaction may follow a fully metathesis pathway as shown in Scheme 1 by the carbenic catalyst or it may proceed through a non-metathesis pathway as shown in Scheme 2 with the intervention of a non-carbenic species generated by the decomposition of the catalyst. This study reveals intriguing aspects of the mechanism and suggests decisive modification on the catalyst for the viable cyclo trimerization of acetylene. 2 Computational section All the calculations are done with Gaussian09 program [67]. Optimization of the geometries and frequency calculations are done at BP86/BS1 level of theory [68,69]. Further single point calculations in solvent (dichloromethane) is done at the BP86-D2/BS2 level of theory [70] using the SMD salvation model [71] implemented in Gaussian09. In BS1, ruthenium center is defined with LANL2DZ basis set and effective core potential while 6-31G* basis set is used to define other atoms. In BS2, ruthenium center is described with LANL2DZ basis set augmented with f polarization function and effective core potential while lighter elements are described using 6-31+G** basis set. All transition states are characterized by a single imaginary frequency along the reaction coordinate whereas all intermediates are confirmed to be a minimum by locating zero imaginary frequency in the vibrational analysis. Further IRC technique is used to confirm the reactant to product connectivity of some important transition states [72]. Further, to validate the BP86-D2/BS2/SMD results, we also modeled the energetics of a representative set of reactions using M06/BS2/SMD (Supplementary material) [73]. 3 Results and discussion Mechanistic studies on the metathesis (pathway 1) and non-metathesis (pathway 2) pathways of acetylene cyclotrimerization are examined using Grubbs first generation catalysts 1 and 1′ catalyst 1 is a real catalyst model of formula (PCy3)2Cl2RuCHMe while 1′ is a smaller version of 1 ((PMe3)2Cl2RuCHMe). Further Grubbs second generation catalysts are tested to understand how ligand environment is affecting the reaction path (Supplementary material). 3.1 Pathway 1: metathesis pathway Fig. 2 describes the intermediates and transition states located in the metathesis pathway for the reaction of three units of acetylene to yield benzene catalyzed by 1. Metathesis reaction pathway begins with the dissociation of the labile ligand from 1 to generate the catalytically active carbene complex 1a: (':' indicates the carbene character). One of the acetylenes coordinates to the metal center in 1a: to yield 1a:C2H2 . The CC bond coupling (2+2 cycloaddition) in 1a:C2H2 via the transition state 1ts1 gives the ruthenacyclobutene-like complex 1a4cyc and is confirmed by doing IRC. The metallacycle 1a4cyc opens up with almost no barrier to cross and generates the second ruthenium carbene complex 1b: which becomes the active complex in the next metathesis step [42]. Subsequent addition of alkyne to the metal center in 1b: proceeds through transformations similar to that in the first metathesis step. For instance, 1b:C2H2 passes through 1ts2 to yield 1b4cyc and the subsequent ring opening gives the third carbene complex 1c:. Similarly further propagation in the reaction can be described from 1c: by 1c:C2H2 , 1ts3, 1c4 cyc and 1d:. Since in 1d:, the carbene carbon is conjugated with a chain of six unsaturated carbon centers, a six-membered ring closing metathesis (RCM) process could be envisaged. Formation of 1e from 1d: is considered by allowing the terminal double bond of the carbon chain to coordinate with the metal center. The 1ts4 describes the CC bond coupling in 1e and the resulting system is the benzene complex 1a:C6H6 . Dissociation of benzene from this complex regenerates 1a:. Considering the structural features, a shortening in the RuP (∼2.25Å) and RuCl (∼2.36Å) bonds are observed in the monophosphine carbene complexes 1a:, 1b:, 1c: and 1d: compared to the catalyst 1. A gradual, but minor lengthening of the RuC: bond distance with increase in the alkene chain length is also observed, as the RuC: distances are 1.83, 1.85, 1.86 and 1.87Å respectively for 1a:, 1b:, 1c: and 1d:. In the transition state corresponding to the CC bond coupling steps, the CC interaction distance is found to be in the range 2.12–2.28Å. The metathesis reaction pathway using the smaller catalyst 1′ is very similar to that of 1. The intermediates and transition states formed in the course of the reaction are very similar to that given in Fig. 2 (Supplementary material). The free energy reaction profile of 1′ is compared with that of 1 in Fig. 3 . Both 1 and 1′ show a highly exergonic reaction profile as the triple bonds are converted to aromatic CC bonds. Dissociation of PR3 ligand is essential for the reaction to get initiated and the free energy change is highly in favor for this process for 1 and 1′. The activation barrier (ΔG#) located for the first, second and third metathesis steps are 9.5, 3.9, and 13.2, kcal/mol, respectively for catalyst 1. With the small catalyst 1′ though the reaction energy profile shows a more exothermic character, ΔG# for each metathesis step is comparatively high viz. 12.6kcal/mol for first, 18.9kcal/mol for second and 18.6kcal/mol for third metathesis step. The last RCM step for 1 passing through 1e and 1ts4 has ΔG# of 16.6kcal/mol (Fig. 3b) while 1′ passing through 1′e and 1′ts4 shows a small value 10.7kcal/mol (Fig. 3c). The high activation barrier for final RCM for 1 may be attributed to the energy required for folding up of the long alkyl chain and to the steric hindrance by bulky ligands. On the basis of energetics of the final RCM step, smaller catalyst 1′ can be considered as catalytically more active than the bulky catalyst 1 for acetylene trimerization reaction via metathesis pathway. The metallacycle intermediates located in metathesis pathway of trimerization reaction viz. 1a4cy c, 1b4cyc , 1c4cyc are different from the normal metallacyclobutanes of alkene metathesis or metallacyclobutadienes of alkyne metathesis. The metallacycle intermediates of alkene and alkyne metathesis are characterized by short RuCβ distance and long CC bonds. But metallacycles observed herein do not possess any such characteristic bonding features. Instead the metal center has an η3 type interaction with the carbon fragment. Such η3 vinyl carbene complex is reported by Grubbs et al. [74] and is further confirmed by mechanistic studies on the enyne metathesis [75,76]. Recently Solans-Monfort reported molybdacylobutene as a short lived intermediate in the ring closing enyne metathesis catalyzed by molybdenum alkylidene complexes [77]. Here also the ruthenacyclobutene-like ring structures observed in the metathesis reaction pathway immediately opens up to a carbene structure. We are able to locate a transition state to define the ring opening of a4cyc (Supplementary material). The activation barrier recorded for the a4cyc cleavage for 1 is 2.7kcal/mol while the barrier for 1′ is 1.3kcal/mol. Though these transition states are almost barrier-less, their identification confirms the presence of ruthenacyclobutene-like structures in the metathesis pathway. Also the metal chlorine distance increases gradually along the series 1a4cyc , 1b4cyc and 1c4cyc while a Cα-Cl distance decreases. In fact, in 1b4cyc and 1c4cyc the Cα-Cl distance is 1.87Å and it suggests a bond between the two. This again confirms that the metallacycle is not the regular metallacycles observed in the course of the metathesis and can be treated as η3 vinyl complexes. On ring opening, the chlorine atom bonded to Cα in 1b4cyc and 1c4cyc migrates back to the metal center to form the new carbene complex (Fig. 2). The highly exothermic nature of the reaction and the moderate reaction barriers depicted in Fig. 3 propose a theoretical suggestion that Grubbs olefin metathesis catalysts has the ability to perform as an efficient trimerization catalysts for acetylenes. However, a remarkable catalytic activity of Grubbs catalysts with bulky ligands for trimerization reactions is never reported. From the reaction profile, it is clear that the efficiency of the RCM step (1d: to 1e or 1′d: to 1′e) determines the success of such a reaction. But it is very likely that the fourth carbene intermediate 1d: or 1′d: may undergo yet another cross metathesis step and subsequent propagation of similar reaction may lead to the expansion of the alkylidene chain in presence of excess acetylene [76,78]. In Fig. 3b, the reaction profile for the cross metathesis step of 1d: and in Fig. 3c the same for 1′d: is represented using dotted line. Also Fig. 4 gives the reaction intermediates and transition states for 1d: to 1f: conversion. The formation of the metallacycle intermediate 1d4cyc or 1′d4cyc is more facile than RCM and leads to a more exothermic product than the benzene complex in the case of bulky catalyst 1. The reaction may continue with more metathesis steps leading to further propagation of the alkene chain especially with acetylenes. In the case of 1′ the activation barrier reported for RCM (10.7kcal/mol) is lesser than that required for the propagation step (17.3kcal/mol). Thus in the case of 1 it is clear that benzene formation can occur only as a minor pathway through a RCM step and most likely, the reaction is highly biased towards the open chain metathesis transformation. But for 1′, the smaller catalyst system, the cyclotrimerization reaction can lead to the benzene formation. So far most of the trimerization reaction of alkynes via a cascade of metathesis step is reported only for first generation catalysts [36–38]. To understand how N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) of Grubbs second generation catalysts affect the reaction pathway we took two catalysts 2 and 2′. 2 is a realistic model of Grubbs second generation catalyst with bulky mesityl group in the nitrogen of NHC and PCy3 ligand as the labile ligand. 2′ is the smaller version of 2 with methyl group on NHC and PMe3 group as labile ligand. The reaction via metathesis pathway using 2 and 2′ are similar to that of first generation catalysts given in Figs. 2 and 3. The reaction intermediates and transition states formed in the reaction are given in the Supplementary material. The key to trimerization reaction is the formation of the intermediate e wherein the terminal double bond of the alkene chain coordinates to the metal center. Reaction energy profile for this crucial step using 2 and 2′ are given in Fig. 5 . It is clear from Fig. 5 that the probability for a ring closing metathesis is less, and a cross metathesis leading to the polyene chain is favoured for both 2 and 2′. 3.2 Pathway 2: non-metathesis pathway The non-metathesis reactions exhibited by ruthenium carbene complexes broaden the applicability the catalyst. Though the mechanism through which such reactions proceed is not known, the non-metathesis active species are reported as decomposition products of the catalysts generated under strong reaction conditions. The modified catalyst in the decomposition pathway is found to be devoid of carbene center. Here with the help of computational techniques we are proposing a catalyst transformation involving the chloro ligand migration to carbene center leading to the formation of complex g (Fig. 6 ), a possible catalyst for cyclotrimerization of acetylene via a non-metathesis pathway. This complex has the potential to undergo further reaction as a vacant space is created on the metal center for the acetylene coordination. In the case of 1, acetylene coordinates to the metal center in the space generated by the chlorine migration (1g-C2H2 ). The process is energy demanding as the coordination increases the steric crowding around the metal center. Phosphine dissociation from the sterically crowded system 1g-C2H2 is quite easy and one of the RuP bonds cleaves spontaneously to give 1 h. Next step is the formation of the bis-alkyne complex 1h-C2H2 . Subsequent steps of the reaction are very similar to the pathway shown in Scheme 2, viz. CC bond coupling between the coordinated alkynes via 1ts7, formation of ruthenacyclopentadiene (1i5cyc ), coordination of the third alkyne to ruthenium (1i5cyc-C2H2 ), CC bond coupling between alkyne and metallacycle (1ts8), formation of bicyclic intermediate complex (1j), formation of ruthenacycloheptatriene (1k7cyc ) via transition state 1ts9 and CC bond coupling within the metallacycle via 1ts10 to form the benzene complex 1a:C6H6 . Activation barrier for the transition states 1ts7, 1ts8, and 1ts9 are small, viz. 8.9, 16.9, and 12.2kcal/mol, respectively while the activation barrier for 1ts10 is significantly high (28.3kcal/mol). Acetylene trimerization via non-metathesis pathway catalyzed by smaller catalyst 1′ shows intermediates and transition states similar to that discussed for 1 (Supplementary material). The reaction free energy profile for 1′ is compared with that of 1 in Fig. 7 . The smaller catalyst 1′ shows a more exothermic profile and the activation barrier for ts7, ts8, ts9, and ts10 are 8.5, 9.3, 9.6 and 16.7kcal/mol respectively. Catalytic transformation involving chlorine migration is the rate determining step of the reaction. The activation barrier required for this transformation in 1 (36.6kcal/mol) is higher than that located for 1′ (23.3kcal/mol). The remaining portions of the reaction profile of 1 and 1′ are very similar. The rate determining step of the non-metathesis step (chlorine ligand migration) is attempted with second generation catalyst of catalysts 2 and 2′ (Supplementary material). The activation barrier for the chlorine migration in 2 and 2′ is 40.2 and 24.1kcal/mol, respectively. These results indicate that with smaller ligands the catalyst transformation will be easier. Also the coordination of acetylene slightly stabilizes the system as the steric crowding is less around the metal center. In contrary to the big catalysts systems dissociation of the labile ligand requires ∼30kcal/mol of energy for smaller version. Therefore, chloro migration appears feasible than phosphine dissociation. Once the phosphine ligand dissociates, the second acetylene coordination and CC bond coupling occur easily to form a stable ruthenacyclopentadiene. The remaining rearrangements are very similar to that shown for first generation catalyst and are given in Supplementary material. These observations indicate that metathesis pathway may dominate over non-metathesis pathway for benzene formation using Grubbs catalyst with smaller ligands. Recently Cavallo et al. reported that the chloro ligand of Grubbs catalyst has a tendency to undergo dissociation in polar solvents and the reaction may even compete with the phosphine ligand dissociation [79]. Here the energetics reported in Table S2 show that the chloro ligand migration is more facile than chloro ligand dissociation for all the catalysts except 2. Decomposition of Grubbs catalysts involving the coordination of dissociated phosphine ligand to the carbene carbon is well known. We also attempted this decomposition using all the four catalysts models. The phosphine migrated complex is slightly more stable than chlorine migrated complex by ∼2.0kcal/mol for 1, 1′ and 2′ whereas catalyst 2 with bulky mesityl group on the NHC nitrogen has more stable phosphine migrated product (13.3kcal/mol) and it may follow the decomposition pathway suggested by Grubbs [59]. 4 Conclusions Mechanistic study on the cyclotrimerization of acetylene using Grubbs first and second generation catalysts shows two probable pathways. Both pathways are highly exergonic, and the final product is stabilized by ∼120kcal/mol. Metathesis pathway is defined by three successive cross metathesis (CM) followed by a ring closing metathesis (RCM). The metathesis reaction pathway is found to be a feasible path for cyclotrimerization as the activation barrier for the reaction is moderate in all the steps. Chance of acetylene coordination to complex d:, leading to a fourth CM instead of the RCM is high with all the catalysts except 1′. This suggests that the Grubbs first generation catalyst could be modified by reducing the steric influence to prefer the RCM over CM to get a new efficient reaction for benzene synthesis. Catalytic transformation of Grubbs catalyst is also explored in the non-metathesis pathway. Though, the chloro ligand migration from the metal center to the carbene is an energy demanding process, it may compete with phosphine dissociation step in the case of catalysts made with less bulky and strongly coordinating phosphine ligands. The smaller version of the first generation catalyst 1′ show significant reduction in the activation barrier for the chlorine migration compared to their original catalysts. Again a proper tuning of the steric influence of the coordinating ligands is evident in the non-metathesis reaction profile of 1′ to achieve cyclotrimerization via non metathesis pathway. In summary, by reducing the steric influence and improving the coordination strength of phosphine ligands in Grubbs catalysts, efficient catalysts could be developed for cyclotrimerization of acetylene.

        "dc:description": "Cyclotrimerization of acetylene by Grubbs first and second generation CC bond metathesis catalysts has been attempted by experimentalists with limited success and lack of reliable information about the mechanism of the reaction hinders further progress in the development of efficient catalysts. Herein, we describe a systematic density functional theory study on the probable mechanisms of this reaction and show that it proceeds through either a fully metathesis pathway (pathway 1) or through an alternate non-metathesis pathway (pathway 2). Pathway 1 consists of four metathesis steps characterized by the formation of metallacyclobutene-like intermediate in each step while pathway 2 passes through a metallacyclopentadiene intermediate. In metathesis pathway, the final ring closing metathesis step for benzene formation competes with another cross metathesis propagation step towards polyene chain expansion. Pathways 1 and 2 show a highly exothermic ∼120kcal/mol reaction profile due to the tremendous energy gain in converting acetylene triple bonds to aromatic bonds. The reaction is highly influenced by the choice of ligands in the catalyst design, particularly, by reducing the steric influence of ligands, cyclotrimerization of acetylene to benzene appears as a feasible process by Grubbs-type catalysts.",
