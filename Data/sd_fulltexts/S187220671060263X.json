DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60263-X Fe 3 O 4 Nanoparticles as an Efficient and Magnetically Recoverable Catalyst for the Synthesis of 3,4-Dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-ones under Solvent-Free Conditions Masoud NASR-ESFAHANI*, S. Jafar HOSEINI, Fatemeh MOHAMMADI Department of Chemistry, Yasouj University, Yasouj 75918-74831, Iran Abstract: The catalytic activity of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles (NPs) in a one-pot three component condensation reaction consisting of an aromatic aldehyde, urea or thiourea, and a È•-dicarbonyl under solvent-free conditions was investigated. This reaction affords the corresponding di- hydropyrimidinones (thiones) in high to excellent yields. Compared with the classical Biginelli reactions this method consistently gives a high yield, easy magnetic separation, a short reaction time, and catalyst reusability. Key words: dihydropyrimidinones; dihydropyrimidinthiones; ferroferric oxide nanoparticle; one-pot condensation; solvent-free As green chemistry is currently a major concern for organic chemists, reactions under solvent-free conditions with a solid catalyst have received much attention [1]. Green chemistry approaches hold significant potential for the reduction of by- products, a reduction in the amount of waste produced, lower energy costs, and enhanced selectivity. Additionally, the de- velopment of new methodologies toward the synthesis of pre- viously unobtainable materials using existing technologies is of interest [2]. Dihydropyrimidinones and dihydropyrimidinthiones are important classes of heterocycles that have attracted much synthetic interest and their derivatives have pharmacological and biological properties such as antihypertensive activity, calcium channel blocking, alpha-1a-antagonism, neuropeptide Y (NPY) antagonism, antitumor, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activity [3â€“6]. Notably, monastrol (1) is the only cell-permeable molecule that blocks normal bipolar spindle assembly in mammalian cells causing cell cycle arrest [7] and is considered a lead for the development of new anti- cancer drugs [8] while appropriately functionalized DHPM analogs have emerged as orally active antihypertensive agents (2, 3) [6] (Scheme 1). Because of the importance of these compounds as synthons in organic synthesis, many synthetic methods for the prepara- tion of these compounds have been developed based on the Biginelli reaction [9]. The simple and direct method originally reported by Biginelli in 1893 involved a three-component condensation reaction between an aldehyde, urea, and a * N N S EtO 2 C H H OH N N O H CONH 2 NO 2 N N S H F 3 C N O F Me Me pr i O 2 C 1 2 Me pr i O 2 C 3 Scheme 1. Dihydropyrimidine antagonists. Nasr-Esfahani MASOUD et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1484â€“1489 È•-ketoester under acidic conditions [10]. One major drawback of this reaction, however, is the low to moderate yields that are frequently obtained when using substituted aromatic or ali- phatic aldehydes [11]. This has led to the development of more complex multistep strategies that produce somewhat higher overall yields but lack the simplicity of the one-pot Biginelli protocol [11,12]. Thus, Biginelliâ€™s reaction for the synthesis of dihydropyrimidinone has received renewed interest and several improved procedures have recently been reported [13â€“16] although some of these methods involve the use of strong Lewis acids such as BF 3 [14], Bi(NO 3 ) 3 [15], and Ln(OTf) 3 [16], protic acids such as AcOH [14], and additives [14]. However, there are several disadvantages associated with the reported methodologies including unsatisfactory yields, long conversion times, difficult handling of reagents, toxic and inflammable organic solvents, and incompatibility with other functional groups in the molecules that limit these methods to small-scale synthesis. Thus, the development of facile and environmentally friendly synthetic methods for the preparation of dihydropyrimidinones and dihydropyrimidinthiones are in demand. Recently, the application of nanoparticles (NPs) as catalysts has attracted worldwide attention because of their high cata- lytic activity and improved selectivity [17]. Although the nanocatalysts have several advantages over conventional catalyst systems the isolation and recovery of these nanocata- lysts is difficult. To overcome this problem the use of mag- netically recoverable nanocatalysts is of interest [18]. This type of nanocatalyst can be easily separated from the reaction mixture using an external magnetic field. Fe 3 O 4 NPs have been used as an efficient and magnetically recoverable nanocatalyst in the three-component coupling of an aldehyde, an alkyne, and an amine [19]. Also, the application of Fe 3 O 4 NPs as nano- catalysts in a C-C coupling reaction by the Sonoga- shira-Hagihara reaction has been investigated [20]. Because of their inherent properties like environmental friendliness, greater selectivity, operational simplicity, non-corrosive nature, moisture insensitivity, and ease of isola- tion, it is of interest to determine the behavior of this catalytic system for the synthesis of 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-ones (thiones). Following our interest in producing 3,4-dihydropyrimidine- 2(1H)-ones [21,22], a study to revisit this reaction in a parallel combinatorial fashion using the Fe 3 O 4 NPs solvent-free syn- thesis approach was initiated (Scheme 2). 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation of the Fe 3 O 4 NPs The Fe 3 O 4 NPs were prepared as reported in the literature [23]. Typically, to prepare Fe 3 O 4 NPs 5.2 g of FeCl 3 and 2.0 g of FeCl 2 were successively dissolved in 25 ml of distilled water containing 0.85 ml of 12.1 mol/L HCl. The resulting solution was added dropwise into 250 ml of a 1.5 mol/L NaOH solution under vigorous stirring. The last step generated an instant black precipitate. The precipitate was isolated in a magnetic field and the supernatant was removed from the precipitate by decanta- tion. 1.2 Synthesis of 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-ones All the chemicals were purchased from Merck, Fluka and Sigma-Aldrich. The reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The products were isolated and iden- tified by comparing their physical and spectral data with au- thentic samples. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on FT-IR JASCO-680, 1 H-NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker DPX-300 MHz and melting points were determined on a Barnstead Electrothermal (BI 9300) apparatus. In a typical procedure for the preparation of 5-(ethoxycarbonyl)-6-methyl-4-phenyl-3,4-dihydropyrimidin- 2(1H)-one (7a), a mixture of benzaldehyde (1 mmol), ethy- lacetoacetate (1 mmol), urea (1.5 mmol), and Fe 3 O 4 NPs (0.046 g) was stirred at 80 Â°C for 16 min. After the completion of the reaction as determined by TLC, 5 ml of ethanol was added to the reaction mixture, stirred and heated for 5 min. The reaction mixture was filtered and washed with hot ethanol. The hot filtrate was poured onto crushed ice and the solid product collected by filtration and washed with cold ethanol and a mixture of ethanol-water. The solid product was recrystallized from ethanol. The products were characterized by IR, 1 H NMR, and by a comparison of their melting points with the reported melting points. 5-Ethoxycarbonyl-6-methyl-4-(2-chloro-6-flourophenyl)-3, 4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-one (7g). mp: 246â€“248 Â°C; R f = 0.33 (n-hexane:ethyl acetate = 2:1); IR (KBr, cm â€“1 ): 3349, 3122, 2983, 1698, 1636, 1520, 1454, 1230; 1 H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3 ): G 0.95 (t, 3H, J = 7.0 Hz), 2.19 (s, 3H), 3.88 (q, 2H, J = 6.8 Hz), 5.86 (s, 1H), 7.16 (dd, J = 8.2 and J = 21.6 Hz, 1H), 7.3 (m, 2H), 7.63 (s, 1H), 9.3 (s, 1H); Anal.

A number of prominent Bragg reflections reveal that the resultant NPs are Fe 3 O 4 with a spinel structure [24]. The size of the Fe 3 O 4 NPs was also determined from X-ray line broadening using the Debye-Scherrer formula (D = 0.9Èœ/È•cosÈ™, where D is the average crystalline size, Èœ is the X-ray wavelength used, È• is the angular line width at half maximum intensity, and È™ is the Braggâ€™s angle). For the (311) reflection the average size of the Fe 3 O 4 NPs was estimated to be around 13 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were used for charac- terization (Fig. 1(b)). The TEM image reveals spherical Fe 3 O 4 NPs with an average size of 20â€“30 nm. 2.2 Effect of catalyst concentration The catalyst concentration was varied over a range of 5â€“25 mol% iron oxide nanoparticles on the basis of the total volume of the reaction mixture. Table 1 shows the effect of catalyst concentration on the reaction of benzaldehyde, ethylacetoace- tate, and urea or thiourea. The yield of the corresponding di- hydropyrimidinone or dihydropyrimidinthione increased with an increase in the catalyst concentration from 5 to 20 mol%. A further addition of catalyst had no noticeable effect on the yield. This was due to the fact that beyond a certain concentration more catalyst sites exist than that required by the reactant molecules and, hence, the additional amount of catalyst does 20 30 40 50 60 70 I n t e n s i t y 2T/( o ) (a) (220) (311) (400) (422) (511) (400) (b) 20 nm Fig. 1.

Therefore, in all further reactions 20 mol% of the catalyst was used. 2.3 Synthesis of 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-ones (thiones) upon catalysis by Fe 3 O 4 NPs The results from the reaction of È•-dicarbonyl, urea (or thio- urea), and various aldehydes in the presence of optimized Fe 3 O 4 NPs are shown in Table 2. We extended these reaction conditions to a series of aryl aldehydes under solvent-free conditions. Both aromatic aldehydes bearing either activating or deactivating groups reacted well with È•-dicarbonyl to yield the corresponding dihydropyrimidinones (thiones) in high to excellent yields (entries 1â€“29). All the reactions were complete within 15â€“40 min. As for the efficiency of the catalyst, it can be separated from the reaction mixture using a normal magnet. To use Fe 3 O 4 NPs in large scale synthesis, especially in a chemical laboratory, a typical reaction was performed for the synthesis of 7a with tenfold amount of reactants and the cata- lyst with respect to the experiment given in the experimental section. The obtained yield of 90% under these conditions is comparable with that in Table 2. The reactions of acid-sensitive substrates such as cinna- maldehyde also proceeded well to give the dihydropyrimidi- none without any side products (entry 10). However, aliphatic aldehydes such as butanal, as observed previously, reacted over longer times with a reduced yield (entry 8, 70 min time, 43% yield) compared with the aromatic compounds under our re- action conditions [33]. A plausible mechanism for the formation of dihydro- pyrimidinone is shown in Scheme 3. The reaction may proceed through the acid-catalyzed formation of an acyl imine inter- mediate or N-alkylidene urea formed by a reaction between the aldehyde and urea (A). The interception of the iminium ion by È•-dicarbonyl produces an open chain ureide (B), which sub- sequently cyclizes to the dihydropyrimidinones. Because of the Lewis acidity property of the ferrous or ferric ion, complex (A) can be formed through a coordinative bond and stabilized by a metal cation.

Nasr-Esfahani MASOUD et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1484â€“1489 2.4 Comparison of Fe 3 O 4 NPs with bulk Fe 3 O 4 during the synthesis of 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-ones To show the ability of the Fe 3 O 4 NPs with respect to bulk Fe 3 O 4 , some comparative results are summarized in Table 3. The yields and reaction times in the presence of Fe 3 O 4 NPs are better than using bulk Fe 3 O 4 . 2.5 Catalyst reusability The reusability of the catalyst is important for large scale operations and an industrial point of view. Therefore, the re- usability of the catalysts was examined in the reaction between ethylacetoacetate, urea, and benzaldehyde. Since the catalyst can be separated from the reaction mixture using an external magnetic field it was recovered with a simple magnet after the dilution of the reaction mixture with EtOH. The recovered catalysts were dried and weighed. Afterwards, according to the amount of catalyst the required amount of fresh ethylaceto- acetate, urea, and benzaldehyde were added. The results showed that the catalyst can be reused four consecutive times without a noticeable loss in activity (Table 4) 3 Conclusions We found an efficient, inexpensive and straightforward procedure for the one-pot synthesis of dihydropyrimidinones (thiones) using Fe 3 O 4 NPs as a catalyst. We also found that the performance of the catalytic system is greatly facilitated when used without solvents, which is important from the view point of green chemistry. Moreover, the catalysts are nonhygroscopic and inexpensive, which are advantages of this transformation. Acknowledgment We thank Yasouj University for partial support of this work.
