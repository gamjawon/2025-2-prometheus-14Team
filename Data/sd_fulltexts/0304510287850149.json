GALVAGNO, A. DONATO, G. NERI, R. PIETROPAOLO Universitd di Reggio Calabria, Facoltd di Ingegneria, Via Cuzzocrea 48, 1-89100 Reggio Calabria (Italy) and Z. POLTARZEWSKI Istituto CNR-TAE, Via S. Lucia 39, 1-98013 Pistunina (Me) (Italy) (Received January 6, 1987; accepted April 2, 1987) Summary Hydrogenation of nitrobenzene has been carried out over Pt and Pt Sn catalysts at 273 K using ethanol as solvent. In the first stage of the reaction the intermediate phenylhydroxylamine is formed, together with aniline. After almost all nitrobenzene is converted, phenylhydroxylamine is hydro- genated further to aniline. Selectivity to phenylhydroxylamine is scarcely influenced by the level of conversion and by the Pt/Sn ratio. Upon addition of tin, catalytic activity increases at low tin content, and then decreases at higher Sn/Pt ratios. It is suggested that at low concen- tration tin ions act as promoters by activating the oxygen-containing group. At higher tin content, platinum is poisoned and availability of activated hydrogen becomes rate-determining. Introduction In recent years noble metals supported on polyamides have been the subject of several investigations due to their peculiar behaviour in selective hydrogenations [1 - 4]. Moreover, recent studies on the liquid phase hydro- genation of aldehydes over Pt Sn/nylon catalysts have shown that addition of tin chloride to Pt/nylon increases the rate of reduction of the C=0 group. The reaction rate showed a maximum at a Pt/Sn atomic ratio of ~ 3/2, with a subsequent decrease at higher Sn content [5, 6]. In the case of unsaturated aldehydes, high selectivities (>75%) to unsaturated alcohols have been obtained [5]. The same catalytic system behaved differently in the hydrogenation of unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds (propene, phenylacetylene), namely a monotonic decrease in the catalytic activity was observed upon addition of tin [6, 7]. On the basis of a detailed physicochemical characterization [8,9], it has been suggested that tin plays different roles in modifying the catalyst 0304-5102/87/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 380 performance. One is to reduce the platinum sites which activate the hydro- gen molecules; another effect is to activate the oxygen-containing molecule by increasing the polarization charge on the carbonyl group. In order to find a more general validity for the above hypothesis, it was decided to extend our study to other molecules containing polar groups. Nitrobenzene was chosen as probe molecule. Hydrogenation of nitrobenzene has been studied over a large number of catalysts in either the vapor phase [10 -12] or the liquid phase [13 - 23]. However, very few papers have been published so far on nitrobenzene reduction over platinum catalysts [22, 23]. Notwithstanding the large amount of data reported in the literature, the mechanism of the reaction is still debated. Therefore, another goal of the present paper is to contribute to the understanding of the pathways involved in the reduction of the nitrogroup. Experimental Materials Nitrobenzene (Riedel-de Haen AG, purity > 99.5%), ethanol (Carlo Erba RPE-ACS 95%, analytical grade) were used without further purifica- tion. Ultra-high purity B.^ was used after purification by passage through Pt/AlzOa at 673 K, followed by a molecular sieve trap. Catalysts were prepared by impregnation of nylon powder (nylon 66, 50 -100 mesh) with a CzHgOH solution of HzPtCl^ or H^PtClg and SnCI; having the desired concentration of the metals. After impregnation, the cata- lysts were dried at 343 K and reduced in situ at 343 K by bubbling H2 through a slurry of the catalyst in ethanol. Details of the preparative proce- dure and physicochemical characterization are reported elsewhere [6, 8, 9]. Pt and Sn contents were determined by spectrophotometry and atomic absorption spectroscopy, respectively. The chemical composition of the Pt Sn samples is reported in Table 1. Procedure Hydrogenation of nitrobenzene was carried out in a 100 ml four- necked flask fitted with a hydrogen reservoir, dropping funnel, thermo- couple and a stirrer head. The catalyst (0.1 - 0.5 g) was added to the solvent (25 ml ethanol), then reduced at 343 K for 1 h under H2 flow. After cooling at reaction temperature (T^ = 273 K, unless otherwise specified) nitro- benzene (4.84 mmol) was injected through one arm of the flask. The reac- tion mixture was stirred at 400 rpm and the reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure under H; flow. Chemical analysis of the products was performed by gas chromato- graphy (Carlo Erba, Model 4200). Product separation was carried out on a stainless steel column (10 ft X 1/8 in o.d.) filled with 10% SP2100 on 100/120 mesh Supelcoport (purchased from Supeico).

Column temperature was varied according to the following program: 7 min at 363 K, 40 K mm\"1 up to 403 K, 6 min at 403 K, 40 K min\"1 up to 473 K. Reagents and products were identified by comparison with authentic samples. Quantitative analyses were performed using xylene as internal standard. This allowed us to follow the disappearance of nitrobenzene regardless of the products formed, Results Figure 1 shows a typical gas-chromatographic analysis of the reaction mixture during nitrobenzene hydrogenation. Five main peaks can be identi- fied: the first (having a retention time, RT, of about 48 s) is assigned to ethanol used as solvent, the second (RT = 318 s) is xylene used as internal standard, the third (RT= 348 s) is nitrosobenzene, the fourth (RT = 508 s) is aniline and the fifth (JRT = 680 s) is nitrobenzene. Small amounts (gener- ally <3 - 5%) of azoxybenzene were also detected. A parallel check carried out by analyzing the reaction mixture spectrophotometrically showed, however, the absence of nitrosobenzene, which should give an adsorption band at about 780 nm. This apparent disagreement between gas-chromato- graphic and spectrophotometric analyses is due to the fact that while nitrobenzene, aniline, nitrosobenzene, azo- and azoxyderivatives are stable during gas chromatographic analysis, phenylhydroxylamine decomposes to nitrosobenzene and aniline [13]. Owing to the absence of nitrosobenzene in the reaction mixture, it was however possible (after determining the area ratio between nitroso- benzene and aniline formed during decomposition of phenylhydroxylamine) to calculate the real amount of aniline and phenylhydroxylamine in the reac- tion products. 382 0 1000 2000 Time(sec^ Fig. 1. Typical gas-chromatographic analysis (see text). Product distribution (obtained using the above procedure) during nitrobenzene hydrogenation was similar on the monometallic Pt/nylon and on the bimetallic Pt Sn/nylon catalysts. The reaction rate was instead strongly dependent on the Pt/Sn ratio of the catalyst sample used. Figure 2 shows typical results obtained on a Pt Sn catalyst. 150 Time(min) Fig. 2.

A similar order of reaction has been previously reported with other catalytic systems [14,15, 20, 24]. A reaction temperature of 273 K was chosen to minimize diffusional limitations. Under these conditions, a series of runs were carried out in order to determine the effect of catalyst concentration on the hydrogenation rate. Figure 3 shows that the specific rate constants (expressed per gram of platinum) remain unchanged at different catalyst loading. This, together with experiments carried out at different stirring conditions, indicates that the reaction occurs under kinetic control. -30 20 0.2 0.3 04 weight (a) Fig. 3. Influence of catalyst loading on the reaction rate constant. Figure 4 shows the pseudo-zero order rate constants as a function of tin content. Addition of small amounts of tin first increases the rate of hydrogenation of nitrobenzene, which reaches a maximum and then de- creases at higher tin content. Similar trends have been previously reported for the hydrogenation of other oxygen-containing molecules [5, 6, 25]. Selectivities to phenylhydroxylamine in the range 65 - 80% were observed over a large range of conversion, regardless of the tin content. Discussion Results reported in Fig. 2 show that hydrogenation of nitrobenzene with our catalytic system occurs through the intermediate phenylhydroxyl- amine, which is formed together with aniline in the first stage of the reaction. After almost all nitrobenzene has been converted, phenylhydroxylamine is hydrogenated with formation of aniline as final product. Over Pt/nylon, 384 30 40 50 100Sn/(Sn+Pt) Fig. 4. Influence of the Sn/Pt ratio on the rate constant of nitrobenzene hydrogenation. selectivity to phenylhydroxylamine was ~ 75% at 20% conversion, and decreased with reaction time up to a value of ~ 65% at 80% conversion. Reduction of nitrobenzene in the liquid phase has been studied over a large number of catalysts. Palladium, platinum, nickel and rhodium have been reported to be the most effective catalysts [16]. On ruthenium, hydro- genation of nitroaromatic compounds leads also to the saturation of the benzene ring [17]. Literature data show that over palladium [14, 16, 18], rhodium [18] and nickel boride [15], nitrobenzene is selectively hydrogenated to aniline without formation of any intermediate product. Similar results have been obtained over palladium catalysts using cyclohexene as the hydrogen source [19]. On Raney nickel, formation of azo- and azoxyderivatives has been reported by different authors [18, 20]. However, with this catalytic system phenylhydroxylamine was instead found by Debus and Jungers [21]. The mechanism of reduction of nitrobenzene has been reported to be much more complicated than that which would be expected from the reaction products formed. A general scheme, proposed by Wisniak and Klein [18], which is an extension of those previously proposed by Debus and Jungers [21] and Haber [26] is the following: 385 On the basis of our results, it can be suggested that over Pt/nylon the main route which leads to the formation of aniline is: CfiHg-NOa > CfiHs-NO > C<,Hs-NHOH ^ CeHs-NHa with k^> k^, ky. The peculiar behaviour of platinum in the hydrogenation of nitro- benzene with the preferential formation of phenylhydroxylamine has been previously reported by Rylander et al. [22, 23]. It should be noted, how- ever, that in order to obtain high selectivities on a Pt/C catalyst, Rylander et al. added a small amount of DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) to the reaction mixture. No additive was necessary in our case. The observed high selectivity to phenylhydroxylamine has been related to the tendency of platinum to adsorb nitro-aromatics preferentially. In competitive hydrogenations of a mixture of nitrobenzene and phenylhydroxylamine, nitrobenzene was preferentially reduced over platinum, whereas phenylhydroxylamine was preferentially hydrogenated over palladium [22, 23]. This is in agreement with our experiments carried out at different temperatures. An increase in the reaction temperature caused in fact a de- crease in the selectivity to phenylhydroxylamine, from about 70% at 273 K to 60% at 283 K up to 20% at 333 K. It is likely that the decreased selec- tivity is related to a decreased ratio of the adsorption equilibrium constant of nitrobenzene and of phenylhydroxylamine related to different enthalpies of adsorption. Before discussing the effect of tin on the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene over platinum, let us review briefly the results of the chemico- physical characterization carried out on the Pt Sn/nylon samples. More details can be found in the original literature [5-9]. The X-ray analysis performed using WAXS (wide-angle X-ray scattering) and SAXS (small- angle X-ray scattering) techniques has shown that, after H; pretreatment, platinum is in the metallic state whereas no crystalline tin was detected. It has also been found that addition of tin decreases the platinum particle size from about 100 A on the monometallic Pt/nylon sample to 30 A on the catalyst having a Sn/Pt ratio equal to 2/3. TEM (transmission electron microscopy) analysis confirmed the above results [27]. Formation of smaller metal particles by addition of tin has been previously reported [28, 29]. 386 The X-ray investigation also showed a systematic expansion of the platinum lattice parameters upon addition of tin, suggesting the formation of a solid solution of Sn in Pt [8]. Formation of metallic platinum and the absence of isolated metallic tin was confirmed by ESCA [9]. Moreover, this latter technique did not show any preferential surface enrichment. Taking into account the above results, the effect of tin on the catalytic activity of platinum towards nitrobenzene hydrogenation (Fig. 4) cannot be simply attributed to a different fraction of active platinum sites present on the catalyst surface. In fact, addition of tin leads to a monotonic decrease in the metal particle size and therefore to an increase in the metal surface area. The higher surface area could possibly explain the increase in the catalytic activity found at low tin content, but not the decrease observed at higher Sn/Pt ratios. Moreover, it should be noted that also at low tin content no quantitative correlation exists between the increase in the platinum surface area and the increase in the catalytic activity. The curve shape reported in Fig. 4 is qualitatively similar to that previously reported for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde and hydro- cinnamaldehyde [5, 6]. This suggests that tin plays a similar role both in the hydrogenation of the C=0 group and in the reduction of the NO 2 group. At low concentrations, tin ions act as promoters by activating the oxygen- containing group. This is related to their electrophilic nature which leads to a higher polarization of the N 0 (or C=0) bond which becomes more reactive towards the attack of a weak nucleophilic agent, as the chemisorbed hydrogen can be considered. At higher tin content, platinum is poisoned and the availability of activated hydrogen becomes rate-determining. The poisoning effect of tin on the hydrogenation activity of platinum has been previously reported (using the same catalysts) for the reduction of propene [7] and phenylacetylene [6]. In these latter cases, addition of tin caused a decrease in the catalytic activity over the entire range of Sn compo- sition. Similar results have been reported for the hydrogenation of benzene and for the hydrogenolysis of butane and cyclopentane over Pt Sn Al203 catalysts [30]. A comparison between the results on the hydrogenation of the NOa group and those previously reported for the C=0 group [5, 6] show that the maximum value of catalytic activity is obtained at different Sn/Pt ratio. This is not surprising, considering the different electronic structures of the func- tional groups, which would probably require different degrees of activation to reach maximum reactivity.

        "dc:description": "Hydrogenation of nitrobenzene has been carried out over Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts at 273 K using ethanol as solvent. In the first stage of the reaction the intermediate phenylhydroxylamine is formed, together with aniline. After almost all nitrobenzene is converted, phenylhydroxylamine is hydrogenated further to aniline. Selectivity to phenylhydroxylamine is scarcely influenced by the level of conversion and by the Pt/Sn ratio. Upon addition of tin, catalytic activity increases at low tin content, and then decreases at higher Sn/Pt ratios. It is suggested that at low concentration tin ions act as promoters by activating the oxygen-containing group. At higher tin content, platinum is poisoned and availability of activated hydrogen becomes rate-determining.",
