For vanadium content less than 10 wt.- % Vz05 (4.9 Amol(V205) m-Z), the vanadium cations were found to be well spread as vanadate compounds over alumina. Such vanadate species developed Bronsted and Lewis-type acidity as shown by a DRIFT spectroscopy study of pyridine adsorption, but did not exhibit a basic character. Sulphur dioxide adsorption allowed to differentiate a vanadate layer from free alumina. Ammonia and sulphur dioxide adsorptions also showed that at low vanadium coverage, a large part of the vanadate layer was bound to acid-base pairs of alumina. Vanadium pentoxide crystallites were detected at less than complete monolayer coverage with vanadate compounds, but did not contribute to the development of the acidic surface character. At low vanadium coverage, ( < 3 wt.-% Vz05, 1.2 Amol(V205) m-2), the acidic character of the V205/ y-A1203 catalysts is ascribed to vanadium-free alumina, whereas it is largely attributed to vanadate compounds at higher vanadium coverage.

Introduction The characterization of supported vanadium oxide systems is a difficult task due to the intrinsic properties of the carrier. Selective probe molecules are required to determine the experimental coverage of the carrier by the vanadium oxide layer. * Corresponding author. E-mail: auroux@catalyse.univ-lyonl.fr, tel.

Le Bars et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 119 (1994) 341-354 Then, it becomes possible to separate the intrinsic catalytic properties due to the vanadium oxide layer from those due to the carrier, as long as the properties of the carrier are not modified by the covering oxide species. Alumina is known to permit a good dispersion [ 1 ] . The structure of vanadium oxide on alumina gave rise to numerous studies by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) [ 2 ] , radial electronic distribution (RED) [ 3 ] , X-ray diffraction (XRD) [ 4 ] , low-temperature oxygen chemisorption (LTOC) [ 5 ] , Raman [ 1,6,7 ] , UV-Vis [8], extended X-ray absorption fine structure-X-ray absorption near edge structure (EXAFS-XANES) [ 9,10] , X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS ) [ 11-13 ] , electron spin resonance (ESR) [ 14,15 ] , 5' V nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) [16,17], infrared spectroscopy and microcalorimetry of adsorbed probe molecules [ 18-21 ] . It is admitted that vanadates (V04- ) can be formed by the spreading of vanadium oxide over alumina [2,3,9]. These species should be arranged in tetrahedral V04 units [3,9], sharing corners [9] forming a two-dimensional polymeric layer, or sharing one oxygen atom [3] thus building isolated dimeric pyrovanadate-type species. In this work we describe the acid base character of V205 / y-A120g catalysts using probe adsorption methods, namely microcalorimetry and infrared spectros copy. Adsorptions of ammonia, pyridine and sulphur dioxide were performed on the V205/y-A1203 catalysts. Additional characterizations of the catalysts were performed by XPS, ESR and XRD analyses. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts preparation V205/y-A120g catalysts were prepared by conventional wet aqueous impregnation. Defined amounts of ammonium metavanadate NH4V03 corresponding to vanadium pentoxide loadings from 1 to 20 wt.-% were added to an aqueous suspension of y-alumina (Degussa, Oxid C 138 m2 g-' ). Each suspension was stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The water was then slowly removed by a Rotovapor apparatus at 373 K. The catalyst powders were further dried overnight at 393 K. All the samples were finally heated under air flow at 833 K for 15 h. The vanadium content of the catalysts was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (flame N20/CZH2, J1=318 nm). The samples were first dissolved in an acid solution (HF + HZS04 + HN03), then transferred in a dilute HCl solution (0.6 M). Specific areas were measured by the BET method using nitrogen adsorption at 77 K. Before the BET measurements, the samples were outgassed under vacuum at 673 K for 3 h. 2.2. Adsorption microcalorimetry measurements Adsorption microcalorimetry measurements were performed with a Tian-Calvet microcalorimeter C-80 from Setaram. The microcalorimeter was connected to a J. Le Bars et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 119 (1994) 341-354 343 vacuum and volumetric line equipped with a Barocel gauge [ 22 ] . The probes were previously outgassed by freeze-pump-thaw cycles. As standard activation procedure, the samples were heated overnight at 673 K under oxygen, then outgassed at the same temperature for 2 h down to 1.33 mPa pressure. Successive known amounts of the adsorbate were admitted to contact the catalysts placed in the microcalorimeter cell. For each pulse, the adsorption heat and the pressure of the adsorbate were regularly recorded by a microcomputer. The adsorption was carried out until the final equilibrium pressure of 133 mPa was reached. We considered the end of the chemisorption to be reached at an equilibrium partial pressure of 66 Pa. Above this pressure, the probe uptake increased very slowly as indicated by the adsorption isotherm and physisorption mainly occurred. The 66 Pa pressure value is far from the saturated vapour pressure of the probe molecules at 298 K (1242 kPa, 498 kPa and 2.37 kPa for ammonia, sulphur dioxide and pyridine, respectively). Thus capillary condensation was negligible. Adsorption temperatures (353 K for ammonia, sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide, 423 K for pyridine), were chosen so as to avoid physisorption as much as possible. Adsorption microcalorimetry results can be presented in various ways: - the differential enthalpy of adsorption (kJ mol-' of adsorbed probe) versus the probe uptake (,u,mol m-2 of catalyst), - the integral enthalpy of adsorption (J m-2 of catalyst) against the probe uptake, - the adsorption isotherm can be obtained from the volumetry data. 2.3. Adsorption infrared measurements Pyridine adsorptions were also followed using a FT-IR spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer 1710) equipped with a diffuse reflectance cell (DRIFT mode). The resolution of the spectrophotometer was 4 cm-'. The DRIFT cell was connected to a continuous flow gas line equipment. Rate flows were regulated with Brooks mass flow controllers. The temperature of the cell could be monitored from 298 up to 773 K. The background of the cell was recorded at 423 K under nitrogen flow using potassium bromide as reference in the cell. Pyridine was distilled and purged over calcium hydride. Before pyridine adsorption, the catalysts were heated in-situ under air flow at 773 K for 2 h. Then the samples were cooled under nitrogen flow to room temperature for pyridine adsorption. Pyridine pulses were admitted on the DRIFT cell with nitrogen as carrier gas. The spectra are transformed by the Kubelka-Munk function. The scans which were recorded after probe adsorption were subtracted from those recorded before adsorption. Thus, the obtained spectra represent only chemisorbed species. 2.4. XPS measurements The surface composition of the Vz05/y-A1203 catalysts was determined by XRay photoelectron spectroscopy using an A1 anticathode (Leybold Heraeus, LH 10 344 J Le Bars et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 119 (1994) 341-354 spectrometer). The samples were outgassed in the spectrometer chamber without any other treatment. Sample charging effect was corrected for with the Al 2p signal at 73.7 eV. Peak areas were smoothed with Gaussian convolution curves. The peak area of the V 2P3/2, Al 2p, O Is and C is signals were used to determine the relative surface concentrations of vanadium, aluminium, oxygen and carbon, applying the sensitivity factors of 1.3 (V) , 1.24 (Al), 0.66 (O) and 0.25 (C) . 2.5. X-ray diffraction analyses X-ray diffraction analyses were carried out by means of a Philips PW 1710 goniometer with the Cu Ka radiation under standard conditions. 2.6. Electron spin resonance measurements ESR spectra of selected catalysts were recorded at 77 K in air with a Varian E9 101 line spectrometer equipped with the X band. The spectra were calibrated with DPPH using a dual cell. 3. Results 3.1. Physicochemical characterizations The physicochemical characteristics of the V205/y-A1203 catalysts are given in Table 1. Surface areas are not widely affected by increasing vanadium contents, indicating that the impregnation procedure did not appreciably affect the morphol- Table 1 Physicochemical characteristics of the V205/y-A1203 catalysts Vz05/y-A]203 BET Theoretical V:AI atomic ratio V 2P3/2 (M 2g-J) polyvanadate monolayer coverage' (%) (wt.-%) (lc mol Chem.

V/Al atomic ratio analyses by XPS show that this ratio is superior by a factor 2 to 3 to that of the chemical analyses while one should expect more since XPS is sensitive to the first atomic layers. This indicates that some vanadium pentoxide aggregates are probably formed at the y-alumina support. V 2P3/2 signals are broadened on the supported samples compared to the corresponding signal on bulk vanadium pentoxide. This broadening can be explained by the ill-organized structure of vanadium cations over the carrier or by the presence of very small crystallites. Only vanadium (5 + ) cations are detected by XPS spectroscopy on our catalysts while ESR measurements confirm the lack of vanadium (4 + ) cations in the bulk. Theoretical coverages of y-alumina with a monolayer of vanadate species V04- were calculated assuming that units composed of three oxygen atoms and one vanadium atom are covering the carrier. With such an analysis, a vanadate unit occupies 0.10 nm2 [2] and the complete coverage of yalumina, (SBET=138 m2 g-' ), by vanadate species should correspond to 20.9 wt.% vanadium oxide expressed as vanadium pentoxide V205. Above this loading, bulk-like vanadium pentoxide crystallites should begin to grow. X-ray diffraction peaks to be ascribed to vanadium pentoxide crystallites were not detected on the 5.2 wt.-% V205/y-A120g catalyst, but appeared for the 9.8 and 20.8 wt.-% VZOS/ y-A1203 samples. No aluminium vanadate phase was detected by XRD measurements. These results confirm that even below a monolayer coverage with vanadate compounds, some vanadium pentoxide crystallites are formed on y-alumina [ 2 ] . Fig. 1 reports the DRIFT spectra of the 1.1, 2.9 and 9.8 wt.-% V20g/y-A1203 catalysts, recorded at 773 K. The decrease in intensity of the vibration at 3700 cm-' due to hydroxyl groups with vanadium loading shows that the surface vanadate species are formed by reaction of the vanadium salt with surface hydroxyl groups of y-alumina. Note also that the vibration at 3700 cm-' still exists on the 9.8 wt.-% V205 / y-Al203 sample i.e. that free hydroxyl groups of the support remain on the 9.8 wt.-% V205/y-A1203 catalyst, indicating that the total coverage of the 346 J. Le Bars et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 119 (1994) 341-354 carrier by vanadate compounds was not yet reached. An absorption peak is also observed near 2000 cm'. This peak is broad and small for the 1.1 wt.-% V205/ y-A1203 sample and its intensity increased with vanadium content with two peaks at 2027 and 1947 cm` for the 9.8 wt.-% V205/ y-A1203 sample. These vibrations are harmonics of the v(V=O) near 1030 cm- ` observed for vanadium pentoxide. 3.2. Acidic character of the V205/y-A120j catalysts Ammonia microcalorimetry measurements Fig. 2 shows the differential enthalpy of ammonia adsorption at 353 K on pure y-alumina, and on the 1.0 and 2.9 wt.-% V20g/y-A1203 catalysts. The acidic character of the V205/y-A1203 catalysts diminished in amount and strength with vanadium content down to 2.9 wt.-% V205 loading. For higher vanadium contents (see Fig. 3), the acidic features increased again in amount and strength while new weak acid sites appeared for the 9.8 and 20.8 Wt-- /0 V205/ -t-A1203 catalysts. An alternative way to show how the number and strength of acid sites are influenced by the vanadium loading is shown in Fig. 4. This figure shows the integral enthalpy of ammonia adsorption at 353 K under 66 Pa and the corresponding probe uptake as a function of the vanadium content of the V205/y-A1203 catalysts expressed as V205 wt.-%. The increase of the acidic character that is observed for the 2.9-9.8 wt.-% V205/y-A1203 catalysts can be attributed to the development of a vanadate layer. This vanadium oxide layer is not a vanadium pentoxide network because vanadium pentoxide is known to be much less acidic than the blank alumina carrier [ 23 ] . Finally, a plateau is reached for the 9.8 wt.-% V205/y-A1203 catalyst which shows a more pronounced acidic character than pure alumina. The existence of such a plateau may indicate that excess vanadium cations 2 Y 100 i i I t- VNH3 / Pmol.m2 Fig. 2.

Such a conclusion is supported by XPS analyses given in Table 1. Thus, the ammonia adsorptions study shows that the overall acidic features of the V205/ y-A1203 catalysts are provided by the uncovered part of alumina and by the growth of a layer of a vanadate compound over the carrier.

Pyridine microcalorimetry measurements Pyridine adsorptions were carried out at 423 K. At this temperature only strong acid site populations are expected to chemisorb pyridine. Fig. 5 shows the differential enthalpies of pyridine adsorption as a function of the probe uptake, on different VZOg/y-A1203 catalysts. The evolution of the acidic features outlined from previous ammonia adsorptions are confirmed in this diagram. Microcalorimetry data of ammonia and pyridine are compared in Table 2. On a given sample, the initial enthalpy of pyridine adsorption is in the same range as that of ammonia adsorption. The pyridine uptake is less important than the ammonia uptake which may be due to a lower pKa value and a lower temperature of adsorption.

DRIFT measurements Pyridine adsorptions were also followed by infrared spectroscopy using the DRIFT mode, in order to identify the acid sites of the V205 / y-A1203 catalysts as a complementary method to the microcalorimetry measurements. Fig. 6 displays the DRIFT spectra of chemisorbed pyridine on various V205/y-A1203 catalysts (1.1, 2.9 and 9.8 wt.-% V205). Before adsorption, the solids were heated in-situ at 773 K under air flow for 2 h. Adsorption was performed at 298 K and the solids were further flushed under nitrogen at 353 K (see Section 2). Only Lewis-type acidity ( v PyN=1450, 1578 cm-') was detected on the 1 wt. 0/0 sample [ 24] . This sample behaves as pure y-alumina [ 25 ] . The other vibrations at 1492, 1596 and 1615 cm-' are not specific of a given population of acid sites. They correspond to molecularly adsorbed pyridine (1596 cm-'), with hydrogen bond formation with surface hydroxyl groups. They can also result from a combination between different modes of adsorption, namely Bronsted and hydrogen bond types (1615 cm'), or Lewis, Bronsted and hydrogen bond types (1492 cm-'). Bronsted type acidity was detected for the 2.9 wt.-% V20g/y-A1203 catalyst ( v PyNH+=1540 cm-') and more importantly for the 9.8 Wt-- /0 V205/y-A1203 sample. Indeed, a vibration mode at 1638 cm-' has risen on that catalyst and can correspond to Bronsted acid sites. The intensity of the vibration at 1450 cm-', ascribed to Lewis sites decreased with vanadium loading, which is probably due to the covering of y-alumina by the vanadate layer.

This shows that the V205 / y-A1203 samples exhibit a more pronounced acid strength than alumina as the Bronsted and Lewis-type adsorbed species were still observed at 573 K. 3.3. Basic character of the V205/y-AL203 catalysts Sulphur dioxide microcalorimetry measurements The basic features of the V205 / y-A1203catalysts were studied by sulphur dioxide adsorption. The catalysts were subjected to the activation procedure already described for ammonia adsorption. We report in Fig. 8 the differential enthalpies of sulphur dioxide adsorption at 353 K versus the probe uptakes on the V205/yA1203 catalysts and on pure y-alumina. The sulphur dioxide adsorption of the catalysts rapidly decreased with the vanadium content of the samples., Sulphur dioxide can chemisorb on basic oxygen anions OZ- and on basic hydroxyl groups. Such adsorption modes lead to the formation of sulphites and hydrogenosulphites, respectively [ 26] . As sulphur dioxide is not chemisorbed on bulk vanadium pent- Table 3 Experimental coverage of the basic sites of y-alumina by vanadium, as determined by chemisorption of sulphur dioxide at 353 K Vz05 (wt. -%) V d, SOZ (66 Pa) (Amol m-2) BB (%) 0 1.58 0 1.0 0.79 50 2.9 0.35 78 5.2 0.30 81 9.8 0.09 94 20.8 0 100 352 J.

Fig. 9 displays the sulphur dioxide uptake and the corresponding integral enthalpy of adsorption at 66 Pa and 353 K, as a function of the vanadium content of the catalysts. Such sulphur dioxide adsorption appears to decrease in an exponential way with the alumina coverage by vanadium compound, i.e. much more rapidly than one may expect from simple (theoretical) geometrical coverage by vanadate species. It is a measure of basic sites concentration on y-alumina versus vanadium content (see Table 3) . 4. Discussion Physicochemical characterizations obtained by XRD and XPS analyses agree with the covering of y-alumina, up to 10 wt.-% V205 loading, by a dispersed vanadate layer. This vanadate layer exhibits a strong Bronsted-type acidity for vanadium contents higher than 3 Wt-- /0 V205, as revealed by pyridine adsorptions followed by DRIFT spectroscopy. From the sulphur dioxide uptakes on the V205/ y-A1203 catalysts, it is suggested that the vanadate layer does not show a basic character. The surface of y-alumina and of the V205/y A1203 catalysts is partly described by ammonia, pyridine and sulphur dioxide adsorptions measurements. For example, from Figs. 4 and 9, assuming that the adsorptions are not dissociative at 353 K, one can calculate the uptakes of ammonia and sulphur dioxide on y-alumina which correspond to 2.16 and 1.58 tamol m - 2 i.e. 26 and 19%, respectively, of the number of hydroxyl groups of pure amphoteric alumina, assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry between ammonia or sulphur dioxide and hydroxyl groups and taking the value of 8.3 Amol (OH) M-2 for a 773 K-dehydroxylated y-alumina [ 27 ] . We have shown by DRIFT measurements (see Fig. 1) that the hydroxyl groups of y-alumina are neutralized by the vanadium salt. For low vanadium concentration in the preparation medium, strong acid groups of y-alumina are preferentially involved in the reaction with the vanadium salt. For higher vanadium concentration (corresponding to 2-10 wt.-% V205/y-A1203), medium or weak acid sites of yalumina reacted with the vanadium salt while new acidity was generated due to the vanadate compounds attached to the y alumina surface. Finally, for high vanadium content in the preparation medium, vanadium pentoxide crystallites are formed and hardly exhibit acidity. In summary, one can conclude that for low vanadium content, ( < 2 wt.-%V205), the acidity of the V205/y-A1203 catalysts is essentially ascribed to vanadium-free alumina surface since the 2 wt.-%V205 loading represents only about 10% of the full (theoretical) geometrical coverage of the carrier by vanadate units (see Table 1) . Above the 2 wt.-%V205 loading, the acidic character of the vanadate layer that J. Le Bars et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 119 (1994) 341-354 353 is being built on y-alumina grows at the expense of the acidic features due to yalumina. On the other hand, sulphur dioxide adsorptions demonstrate that the attachment of vanadium salt on -t-alumina also concerns the basic sites of the support, particularly in the 0-10 wt.-%V205 content range. Thus the attachment of vanadium atoms on y-alumina in the 0-10 wt.-%V205 content range should involve both basic and acidic hydroxyl groups of the carrier, and in the first place strong acidbase pairs of y-alumina. One may formulate the (paired) reaction of vanadium salt with hydroxyl groups of y-alumina (in particular one basic hydroxyl group and one acidic present on the amphoteric y-alumina) as follows: NH4VOg - NH3 + V02(OH) (1) V02(OH) + 2A10(OH) - (Al0)2V04H + H20 (2) while (Al0)2V04H species would be formed [20]. Eq. (2) is valid at low and medium vanadium coverage ( < 11.0 Wt-- /0 V205, 5.45 jamol (V205) m-2 taking the value of 21.6 gmol(OH) m-2 for a 373 Kdehydroxylated y-alumina [ 27 ] ) . Following the stoichiometry of reaction (2) , the number of the acid-base pairs of y-alumina as titrated by ammonia and sulphur dioxide should correspond to the number of basic sites of the starting free-alumina, i.e. to 1.58 gmol m - 2 (see Table 3) or 2 wt.-% V205 content. However one should note that the experimental coverage of the basic sites of y-alumina for the 2 wt.-% V205 loading, as titrated by sulphur dioxide adsorption, is 67% and only reached 94% for the 9.8 wt.-%o V205 content. It is quite probable that other populations of hydroxyl groups of y-alumina are competing with acid-base pairs of the carrier for the reaction with vanadium salt to form surface vanadate species, in addition to the condensation of vanadium cations as particles of vanadium pentoxide. However above 2 wt.-% V205, most of the strongest acid-base sites of yalumina were neutralized by the deposition of vanadate compounds and the acidic character of the V205/y-A1203 catalysts can be largely ascribed to the vanadate species. 5. Conclusion This work allows us to draw some conclusions concerning the deposition of vanadium species on the y-alumina surface. A vanadate layer that is formed by deposition of vanadium salt on y-alumina exhibits a strong Bronsted acidity as shown by DOS of pyridine adsorption. The dispersion of vanadium cations in a vanadate layer is, however, limited by the impregnation preparation method. The microcalorimetric study of sulphur dioxide adsorption at 353 K permitted to determine the number and strength of the basic sites remaining on the vanadium-free 354 J. Le Bars et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 119 (1994) 341-354 alumina surface, while the vanadate species and bulk vanadium pentoxide were observed not to have basic sites. The drop in both basic and acid sites at low vanadium coverage ( <3.0 wt.-% V205, 1.22 ,amol (V205) m-2) is interpreted by the reaction of vanadium salt with acid-base hydroxyl group pairs of y-alumina during the preparation of the catalysts. At low vanadium coverage, ( < 3.0 wt.-% V205, 1.22 Eimol (V205) m-2), the acidic character of the catalysts is attributed to the vanadium-free alumina surface, i.e. the monomeric vanadate species formed first at low vanadium loading, are not strongly acid. By contrast the surface vanadate layer at higher vanadium coverage exhibits acidic properties of Bronsted and Lewis types. References [ 1 ] J.M. Lopez-Nieto, G. Kremenic and J.L.G. Fierro, Appl.

The acid-base properties of V2O5 /γ-Al2O3 catalysts were characterized by ammonia, pyridine and sulphur dioxide adsorptions using microcalorimetry and diffuse reflectance Fourier transform Ir spectroscopy (DRIFT). For vanadium content less than 10 wt.-% V2O3 (4.9 μmol(V2O5) m−2), the vanadium cations were found to be well spread as vanadate compounds over alumina. Such vanadate species developed Brønsted and Lewis-type acidity as shown by a DRIFT spectroscopy study of pyridine adsorption, but did not exhibit a basic character. Sulphur dioxide adsorption allowed to differentiate a vanadate layer from free alumina. Ammonia and sulphur dioxide adsorptions also showed that at low vanadium coverage, a large part of the vanadate layer was bound to acid-base pairs of alumina. Vanadium pentoxide crystallites were detected at less than complete monolayer coverage with vanadate compounds, but did not contribute to the development of the acidic surface character. At low vanadium coverage, ( <3 wt.-%V2O5, 1.2 μmol(V2O5) m−2), the acidic character of the V2O5/γ-Al2O3 catalysts is ascribed to vanadium-free alumina, whereas it is largely attributed to vanadate compounds at higher vanadium coverage.
