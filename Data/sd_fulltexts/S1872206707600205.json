RESEARCH PAPER Pt Catalyst Supported on Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes for Hydrogenation-Dearomatization of Toluene ZHOU Min, LIN Guodong, ZHANG Hongbin* State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, China Abstract: Using homemade multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the support, the Pt/CNTs catalyst was prepared by an incipient wetness method. Performance of the catalyst for hydrogenation-dearomatization (HDA) of toluene was evaluated and compared with the reference catalysts supported on γ -Al 2 O 3 and activated carbon (AC). Over the 1.0%Pt/CNTs catalyst under the reaction conditions of 0.4 MPa, 373 K, PhCH 3 /H 2 = 6/94 (mol/mol), and GHSV = 120 L/(h·g), the observed conversion of toluene HDA reached 100%, and the cor- responding specific reaction rate was 0.0523 mmol/(s·m 2 ). This value was 1.17 and 1.18 times that of the 1.4%Pt/γ -Al 2 O 3 and 2.4%Pt/AC catalysts with the respective optimal Pt loading, respectively. It was experimentally found that using CNTs in place of γ -Al 2 O 3 or AC as the support of the catalyst did not cause a significant change in the apparent activation energy for the toluene HDA reaction but led to a slight increase in concentration of catalytically active Pt species (Pt 0 ) at the surface of the functioning catalyst. In addition, the Pt/CNTs catalyst could reversibly adsorb a greater amount of hydrogen under atmospheric pressure at temperatures from room temperature to 573 K. This unique feature would help to generate a microenvironment with higher stationary state concentration of active hydrogen adspecies at the surface of the functioning catalyst. These effects favored the toluene HDA reaction. Key Words: multiwalled carbon nanotube; platinum; supported catalyst; toluene; hydrogenation–dearomatization Hydrogenation–dearomatization (HDA), together with hy- drodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN), is one of the important hydroprocessing processes of petroleum refining [1,2]. The existing sulfided CoMo, NiMo, and NiW catalysts for the HDA reaction are active only at relatively high temperatures (e.g. > 573 K), and hence complete hydro- genation of aromatics is not possible owing to equilibrium limitations [3]. Noble metals are active for hydrogenation at low temperatures, yet their use is limited because of their sen- sitivity to sulfur poisoning. In current processing schemes involving noble metal catalysts, two or more stages with mul- tiple catalyst beds are used to achieve deep HDS and deep HDA. HDS occurs in the first stage over a CoMo or NiMo catalyst, followed by the removal of the intermediate byprod- uct gas. HDA over the noble metal catalyst operates in the last stage, where concentrations of catalyst poisons (organosulfur and H 2 S) are extremely low [2,4]. Commercial noble metal-based catalysts for deep hydro- genation of fuels are mostly supported on alumina. Looking for new types of catalyst supports and/or promoters so as to improve low-temperature activity of the catalysts has been one of the ongoing efforts drawing research and development attention [5]. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as a novel nano-carbon material, have been drawing increasing attention recently [6,7]. This new form of carbon is structurally close to a hollow graphite fiber, except that it has a much higher de- gree of structural perfection. This type of carbon nanotube possesses a series of unique features, such as high mechanical strength, graphite-like tube-wall structure, sp 2 -C-constructed surface, and nanometer-sized channels. They display high thermal/electrical conductivity and excellent performance for adsorption and spillover of hydrogen, all of which render this kind of nanostructured carbon material to be promising as a ZHOU Min et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2007, 28(3): 210–216 novel catalyst support and/or promoter. In the present study, using homemade CNTs as the support, a highly active Pt catalyst supported on CNTs was prepared. Its catalytic performance for toluene HDA was evaluated and compared with reference Pt catalysts supported on alumina (γ -Al 2 O 3 ) and activated carbon (AC). These catalyst systems were characterized using a series of physico-chemical meth- ods and techniques. The results shed some light on under- standing the nature of promoter action by the CNTs. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation CNTs were synthesized by the catalytic method reported previously [8]. The freshly prepared CNTs were treated twice with boiling nitric acid (about 8 mol/L) at 363 K for 8 h fol- lowed by rinsing with deionized water and then drying at 383 K under a N 2 atmosphere. Open-end CNTs with somewhat hydrophilic surface were then obtained. Prior to use, the γ -Al 2 O 3 support (Shanghai Chem. Reagent Co.) was dried at 383 K, and the AC support (Xiamen Chem. Reagent Co.) was pretreated first with 10% NaOH aqueous solution and then with 50% HNO 3 solution followed by rinsing with deionized water and drying at 383 K. A series of Pt catalysts supported on CNTs, denoted as x%Pt/CNTs (where x% represented mass percentage of Pt), were prepared by an incipient wetness method. An aqueous solution containing a desired amount of platinum was pre- pared by dissolving H 2 PtCl 6 ·6H 2 O (AR grade, Shanghai Insti- tute of Chem. Reagent) into a desired amount of HCl aqueous solution (0.2 mol/L). This platinum solution was added drop- wise to the HNO 3 -treated CNT support followed by holding overnight, drying at 353 K for 6 h, and cooling to room tem- perature, thus yielding the CNT-supported Pt catalyst precur- sor in an oxidation state. The reference catalysts supported on γ -Al 2 O 3 and AC (with the N 2 -BET specific surface area of 217 and 830 m 2 /g, respectively), denoted as x%Pt/γ -Al 2 O 3 and x%Pt/AC, respectively, were prepared in a similar way. All samples of the catalyst precursor were pressed, crushed, and sieved to a size of 40–80 mesh for the activity evaluation. 1.2 Catalyst evaluation The catalyst was tested for toluene HDA in a continu- ous-flow reactor–gas chromatograph (GC) combination sys- tem. The catalyst sample (50 mg) was used for each test. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst precursor in an oxidation state was prereduced in situ in a 5%H 2 /N 2 (volume percentage) gaseous mixture stream at 0.1 MPa and 2400 ml/h. The reduction temperature was raised from room temperature to 523 K at a rate of 10 K/min, kept at 523 K for 8 h, and then lowered to the desired temperature for the catalyst test. The toluene HDA reaction was conducted at a stationary state under reaction conditions of 0.4 MPa, 343–413 K, and GHSV = 120 L/(h·g). Feed toluene was introduced into the feed stream by flowing H 2 through a bubbler containing redistilled and purified liquid toluene, and its concentration was regulated by controlling the temperature of the bubbler. Reactants and products were ana- lyzed by an online GC (Model GC-950, Shanghai Haixin GC Instrument Co.) equipped with a hydrogen flame ionization detector and a 1.0 m-long DNP column using N 2 as the carrier gas. All data were taken after 2 h of stationary state operation unless otherwise noted. Conversion of toluene was calculated by an internal normalization method. 1.3 Catalyst characterization Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM)/energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) observations were performed using Technai F30 and LEO-1530 electron microscopes, respectively. Specific sur- face area was determined by N 2 adsorption using a Micromer- itics Tristar-3000 (Carlo Erba) system. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were done on a VG Multi-Lab 2000 instrument with Mg K α radiation (300 W, hν = 1253.6 eV) under ultrahigh vacuum (1×10 –7 Pa). Spectra were calibrated internally by the carbon deposit C 1s peak at E b = 284.6 eV. Tests of H 2 -temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) of the catalyst were conducted on a fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor–GC (Shimadzu GC-8A) combined system. Fifty mil- ligrams of the catalyst precursor in an oxidation state was used for each test. The sample was first flushed by an Ar (99.999% purity) stream at 393 K for 30 min to clean its sur- face and then cooled to room temperature followed by switching to a N 2 -carried 5% H 2 gaseous mixture stream as the reducing gas (30 ml/min) to start the TPR measurement from 298 to 773 K. The temperature ramp rate was 10 K/min. Changes of the hydrogen signal were monitored using an online GC (Shimadzu GC-8A) with a thermal conductivity detector. A KOH column (φ 5 mm × 100 mm) was installed at the reactor exit to remove gaseous HCl and H 2 O produced by reduction of the catalyst precursor. Tests of H 2 -temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of the catalyst were conducted on an adsorption/desorption sys- tem. Two hundred milligrams of the catalyst sample was used in each test. Prior to the test, the sample of the catalyst pre- cursor was prereduced in situ in a N 2 -carried 5% H 2 gaseous mixture stream at 0.1 MPa and 2400 ml/h for 8 h. After cool- ing to 373 K and switching to a H 2 (99.999% purity) stream (40 ml/min), the sample was held at 373 K for 1 h, cooled to room temperature, and then maintained at this temperature for 4 h. Subsequently, the catalyst was flushed by an Ar stream at room temperature till a stable baseline of GC appeared. Then, the TPD measurement was started from 298 to 873 K at a ZHOU Min et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2007, 28(3): 210–216 temperature increase rate of 10 K/min. The desorbed exit gases were analyzed by an online GC (Shimadzu GC-8A) with a thermal conductivity detector. Measurements of CO chemisorption on the catalysts were performed on a Micromeritics ASAP-2010 micropore ana- lyzer. From the determined amount of chemisorbed CO, the dispersion and surface area of metallic platinum were calcu- lated [9]. One gram of the catalyst sample was used for each test. The sample was first flushed with a He (99.999% purity) stream and then evacuated for 10 min. A N 2 -carried 5% H 2 gaseous mixture stream as the reducing gas (30 ml/min) was introduced to conduct an in situ H 2 -TPR treatment of the catalyst sample. Subsequently, the sample was evacuated for 1 h at the reduction temperature and for 1 h more after cooling to room temperature. The stream was then switched to gase- ous CO (99.99% purity) to conduct the measurement of CO chemisorption following the specified procedure of the aforementioned analyzer. The results of the blank test showed that under the above-mentioned experimental conditions, the determined amounts of CO chemisorption on the three sup- ports (CNTs, γ -Al 2 O 3 , and AC) were all zero, indicating that the determined amounts of CO chemisorption on the corre- sponding supported Pt catalysts were contributed solely by CO chemisorption on the metal Pt surface. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Composition optimization and performance of cata- lysts Figure 1 shows the assay results of reactivity of toluene HDA over the CNT-supported Pt catalyst with different Pt loadings. In the range of 353–403 K, little activity of toluene HDA was detected over the sole support of CNTs. Toluene conversion increased with increasing Pt loading and reached a maximum 100% at the Pt loading of 1.0% (mass percentage), indicating that the optimal Pt loading was 1.0%. Methyl cyclohexane was the only product of toluene hydrogenation, and no other possible products such as methane, methylcy- clohexene, and methylcyclohexadiene were observed. To investigate the effect of the CNT support on the per- formance of the catalyst, reactivity of toluene HDA over the Pt catalysts supported on γ -Al 2 O 3 and AC was evaluated and compared with that over the Pt catalyst supported on CNTs. The results (Fig. 2) showed that the support could signifi- cantly affect the reactivity of toluene HDA. Under the reac- tion conditions of 373 K, conversion of toluene reached 100% over 1.0%Pt/CNTs, whereas merely 56% and 79% were ob- tained over the counterparts supported on γ -Al 2 O 3 and AC, respectively. Fig. 2 Reactivity of toluene HDA over Pt catalysts supported on CNTs, γ -Al 2 O 3 , or AC (Reaction conditions are the same as in Fig 1 except the reaction temperature.) In view of the difference in the specific surface area for different supports, optimization of the Pt loading on γ -Al 2 O 3 and AC supports was done. The results (Fig. 2) showed that the optimal Pt loading was 1.4% and 2.4% for the γ -Al 2 O 3 and AC, respectively. Over the 1.4%Pt/γ -Al 2 O 3 and 2.4%Pt/AC catalysts, the toluene conversion reached 94% and 100%, respectively, under the same reaction conditions. Note that to make the Pt catalysts attain the same level of activity (i.e. 100% of toluene converted at 373 K), the Pt loading needed on AC was 2.4 times that on CNTs. To compare the catalytic efficiency produced by unit area of metal Pt surface of the catalysts supported by the different supports, the specific reaction rate, that is, the reaction rate of toluene HDA on metallic Pt surface of unit area, was used as reference. From the results shown in Table 1, it can be seen that under the aforementioned reaction conditions at 373 K, the specific reaction rate of toluene HDA over the 1.0%Pt/CNTs catalyst reached 0.0523 mmol/(s·m 2 ), which was 1.17 and 1.18 times that over 1.4%Pt/γ -Al 2 O 3 and 2.4%Pt/AC. Because the observed specific reaction rates (0.0446 and 0.0444 mmol/(s·m 2 )) on the two catalysts sup- Fig. 1 Reactivity of toluene hydrogenation–dearomatization (HDA) over the Pt/CNTs catalyst as a function of Pt loading (Reaction conditions: 0.4 MPa, 373 K, PhCH 3 /H 2 = 6/94 (mol/mol), GHSV = 120 L/(h·g).) ZHOU Min et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2007, 28(3): 210–216 ported on the conventional supports (γ -Al 2 O 3 and AC) were very close to each other, it seems that γ -Al 2 O 3 and AC played the main role as a support, whereas CNTs played dual roles as a supporter and a promoter. Textural properties such as spe- cific surface area A, Pt dispersion, metal Pt surface area A(Pt), and specific reaction rate of the Pt catalysts supported on dif- ferent supports are listed in Table 1.

Reaction conditions are the same as in Fig. 1. The apparent activation energy (E a ) of the HDA reaction of toluene over the Pt catalysts supported on the different sup- ports was measured, and the results are illustrated in the Ar- rhenius plots of Fig. 3. The E a observed on the 1.0%Pt/CNTs catalyst was 40.4 kJ/mol. This value was quite close to 45.4 and 47.0 kJ/mol observed on the 1.4%Pt/γ -Al 2 O 3 and 2.4%Pt/AC catalysts, respectively, which indicated that using CNTs in place of γ -Al 2 O 3 or AC as the support of the sup- ported Pt catalyst did not cause an obvious change in E a for the HDA reaction of toluene.

CNTs used in the present study were a “herringbone type” of multi- walled carbon nanotubes [8]. Previous characterization studies demonstrated that these nanotubes are constructed by a su- perposition of many graphene layer facets, which are tilted at a certain angle with respect to the axis of the central hollow nanofiber, as if a number of cones are placed one on top of the other [10]. Their outer diameters are in the range of 15–45 nm, the inner diameters in 3–5 nm, and the N 2 -BET surface area at about 135 m 2 /g. The contents of element carbon and graphitized carbon are ≥ 99% and > 90%, respectively, in the purified CNTs. A test of H 2 -temperature-programmed hydrogenation (TPH) showed that the temperature needed for initiating the hydrogenation reaction of CNTs with H 2 is ≥ 773 K [11], indicating that these types of CNTs are stable in a H 2 atmosphere at the reaction temperature of HDA. Figure 4 shows TEM and SEM images and EDS spectrum of the 1.0%Pt/CNTs catalyst. It can be seen from Fig. 4(a) that Pt nanoparticles were dispersed well and scattered on the outer and inner surface of CNTs. The Pt particle diameters were below 4 nm as estimated. The SEM/EDS analysis further demonstrated that carbon and oxygen were the two dominant elements at the surface of the catalyst with atomic concentra- tions of 90.64% and 9.29% (the corresponding mass fractions being 87.08% and 11.89%), respectively. The surface oxygen originated most probably from the preoxidation/carboxylation treatment of CNTs with concentrated nitric acid. The content of metal Pt made up of merely 0.07% in atomic percentage (the corresponding mass percentage being 1.03%) in line with the formula for preparation of the catalyst. 2.2.2 H 2 -TPR H 2 -TPR studies of an oxide precursor of a catalyst can pro- vide useful information about its reducibility. Figure 5 shows H 2 -TPR profiles of the Pt catalyst precursors supported on the three supports. For the 1.0%Pt/CNTs catalyst, H 2 reduction was initiated at 415 K and the peak appeared at 498 K. This TPR peak may be ascribed to the continual multi-step sin- gle-electron reduction of Pt n+ species. For the AC-supported Pt catalyst, the position of the H 2 reduction peak went up to 506 K, but the total area intensity of the TPR profile (corre- sponding to a certain amount of H 2 consumed) was estimated to be merely 78% of the value of the CNT-supported catalyst. For the γ -Al 2 O 3 -supported Pt catalyst, H 2 reduction did not initiate until 448 K, and the main H 2 reduction peak appeared at 531 K, 33 K higher than that of the CNT-supported cata- lyst. The area intensity of this peak was 62% of the value of the CNT-supported system. The high specific amount of H 2 consumed (i.e., the amount of hydrogen consumed because of reduction of unit mass of Pt) meant the high percentage of the ZHOU Min et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2007, 28(3): 210–216 Pt n+ species reducible to lower valence in the total Pt amount. On the basis of the difference in the specific amount of H 2 consumed and referring to the temperature of the main H 2 reduction peak, it could be inferred that the order of reducibil- ity of these supported Pt catalysts was 1.0%Pt/CNTs ＞ 1.0%Pt/AC ＞ 1.0%Pt/γ -Al 2 O 3 , in line with the order of ac- tivity of these catalysts for toluene HDA (see Fig. 2). 2.2.3 XPS Figure 6 shows Pt 4f XPS spectra of the tested catalysts 1.0%Pt/CNTs and 1.0%Pt/AC. Certain differences existed between the two catalysts in the position and shape as well as relative intensity of their Pt 4f XPS peaks. With reference to Refs. [12–14] and using the computer software, analysis and fitting of the Pt 4f XPS spectra of these catalysts were done. The results (Fig. 6 and Table 2) showed that Pt n+ species co-existed with mixed valence states at the functioning sur- face of both catalysts, with the major amount in Pt 0 , minor in Pt 2+ , and few in Pt 4+ . In comparison, the atomic percentage of Pt 0 species in the total Pt amount at the surface of the tested 1.0%Pt/CNTs catalyst reached 97.3%. This value was 1.12 times that of the AC-supported counterpart (86.8%). This suggested that using CNTs in place of AC as the support of the catalyst led to a certain increase in relative content of catalytically active Pt species (Pt 0 ) at the surface of the func- tioning catalyst. This result was in line with the aforemen- tioned results of H 2 -TPR measurements. It was also one of the important reasons that led to the significant difference be- Fig. 4 TEM (a) and SEM (b) images and energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) (c) of the 1.0%Pt/CNTs catalyst Fig. 5 H 2 -TPR profiles of catalysts 1.0%Pt/CNTs (1), 1.0%Pt/AC (2), and 1.0%Pt/γ -Al 2 O 3 (3) Fig. 6 Pt 4f XPS spectra of the tested catalysts 1.0%Pt/CNTs (a) and 1.0%Pt/AC (b) ZHOU Min et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2007, 28(3): 210–216 tween the specific activities of the toluene HDA reaction (i.e., toluene conversion on the Pt of unit mass) over the Pt catalysts supported on the two carbon supports, CNTs and AC. This result provides a new evidence for the generally accepted viewpoint that Pt 0 is the catalytically active Pt species for HDA of toluene. For the Pt catalyst supported on γ -Al 2 O 3 , differentiation and analysis of its Pt 4f XPS spectrum would be quite difficult because of low content of Pt and mutual overlapping of the observed Pt 4f XPS peak and the Al 2p XPS peak, and thus this catalyst is not considered in the present discussion.

[15] that graphitized carbon black surfaces are capable of rapidly equilibrating hydrogen/deuterium mixture. The H 2 -TPD investigation by Zhou et al. [16] revealed that hydrogen adsorption on CNTs can occur at ambient temperature and pressure, and the ad- sorption of most (99%) of the H 2 is reversible. The desorbed product is almost exclusively gaseous hydrogen at tempera- tures lower than 723 K and involves CH 4 , C 2 H 4 , and C 2 H 2 in addition to H 2 at temperatures of 773 K and above. This im- plies that H 2 adsorption on CNTs may be in two forms: asso- ciative (molecular state) and dissociative (atomic state). This has also been evidenced by laser Raman spectroscopy charac- terization of the H 2 /CNTs adsorption system [17]. Figure 7 shows the H 2 -TPD profiles of the prereduced Pt catalysts supported on different supports. The H 2 -TPD profile taken on the CNT-supported Pt catalyst involved a low-temperature peak (peak I) and a high-temperature peak (peak II). The low-temperature peak resulted from desorption of weakly adsorbed H species, most probably molecularly adsorbed hydrogen, and the high-temperature peak might be attributed to desorption of strongly adsorbed H species, per- haps dissociatively chemisorbed hydrogen. The area intensity of peaks I and II taken on the catalyst supported on CNTs was much higher than those of the catalysts supported on AC and γ -Al 2 O 3 . Considering that the hydrogenation of some surface carbon by H adspecies (which would lead to consumption of part of H adspecies and formation of C 1–2 hydrocarbons) can occur at temperatures of 773 K and above [16], the tempera- ture region of 323–723 K was used for estimation and com- parison of the area intensities of these H 2 -TPD profiles. The results showed that the ratio of relative area intensities of these H 2 -TPD profiles was in the order 1.0%Pt/CNTs: 2.4%Pt/AC : 1.0%Pt/AC : 1.4%Pt/γ -Al 2 O 3 : 1.0%Pt/γ -Al 2 O 3 = 100:46:31:25:15.

Yet, the result of measurement of the apparent acti- vation energy (E a ) indicated that using CNTs in place of γ -Al 2 O 3 or AC as the support of the Pt catalyst did not cause an obvious change in the E a for the toluene HDA reaction, most likely implying that using CNTs in place of γ -Al 2 O 3 or AC as the support of the Pt catalyst did not alter the major reaction pathway of toluene HDA. On the other hand, the H 2 -TPR and XPS results showed that the CNT-supported Pt catalyst was more easily reduced by H 2 at relatively low temperature, and the relative content of catalytically active Pt species (Pt 0 ) at the surface of the func- tioning catalyst was relatively high, compared to the Pt cata- lysts supported on γ -Al 2 O 3 and AC. This was undoubtedly in favor of enhancing the specific activity of the toluene HDA reaction (i.e., toluene conversion on the Pt of unit mass). Nevertheless, it would be difficult to believe that the 26% increase of toluene conversion over 1.0%Pt/CNTs versus the 1.0%Pt/AC (i.e., 100% versus 79% at 373 K, see Fig. 2) was solely caused by the difference in the atomic percentage of Pt 0 species (i.e., 97.3% versus 86.8%, see Table 2) at the func- tioning surface of the corresponding catalysts. Besides, the difference in the atomic percentage of the Pt 0 species could hardly justify the 17% or 18% increase in the specific reaction rate of toluene HDA (i.e., from 0.0446 or 0.0444 mmol/(s·m 2 ) for 1.4%Pt/γ -Al 2 O 3 or 2.4%Pt/AC to 0.0523 mmol/(s·m 2 ) for 1.0%Pt/CNTs). ZHOU Min et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2007, 28(3): 210–216 Therefore, it seems that the high reactivity, especially the high specific reaction rate, for toluene HDA over the CNT-supported catalyst is closely related to the peculiar structure and properties of the CNT support. From a chemical catalysis point of view, the excellent performance of CNTs for electron transport, hydrogen adsorption/activation, and pro- moting hydrogen spillover is very attractive in addition to its high mechanical strength, nanosize channels, sp 2 -C con- structed surface, and graphite-like tubewalls. On the basis of the above H 2 -TPD results, it could be in- ferred that there would exist a considerably large amount of reversibly adsorbed hydrogen species on the CNT-supported Pt catalyst under the reaction conditions for toluene HDA. This would be beneficial for generating a microenvironment with a high stationary state concentration of active hydrogen adspecies on the surface of the functioning catalyst, especially at Pt x 0 active sites since the highly conductive CNTs might promote hydrogen spillover from the CNTs to the Pt x 0 active sites and thus be favorable to increasing the rate of the toluene HDA reaction. This is very similar to the cases in synthesis of methanol and higher alcohols from syngas over the CNT-promoted Cu–ZnO–Al 2 O 3 [18,19] and Co–Cu [11] catalysts, respectively. 3 Conclusions Multiwalled carbon nanotubes can serve as an excellent support and promoter for the supported Pt catalyst. The sur- face of the “herringbone-type” multiwalled carbon nanotubes, on the one hand, was favorable to high dispersion of the Pt component and reduction/activation of the supported Pt n+ spe- cies at relatively low temperature. On the other hand, CNTs could generate a surface microenvironment with higher sta- tionary state concentration of active hydrogen adspecies through its adsorbing/activating H 2 and promoting hydrogen spillover. Both factors mentioned above were favorable for increasing the rate of the hydrogenation–dearomatization re- action of toluene. References [1] Cooper B H, Donnis B B L.

RESEARCH PAPER Pt Catalyst Supported on Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes for Hydrogenation-Dearomatization of Toluene Min ZHOU Guodong LIN Hongbin ZHANG * State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, China * Corresponding author. Tel/Fax: +86-592-2184591 Using homemade multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the support, the Pt/CNTs catalyst was prepared by an incipient wetness method. Performance of the catalyst for hydrogenation-dearomatization (HDA) of toluene was evaluated and compared with the reference catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 and activated carbon (AC). Over the 1.0%Pt/CNTs catalyst under the reaction conditions of 0.4 MPa, 373 K, PhCH3/H2 = 6/94 (mol/mol), and GHSV = 120 L/(h·g), the observed conversion of toluene HDA reached 100%, and the corresponding specific reaction rate was 0.0523 mmol/(s·m2). This value was 1.17 and 1.18 times that of the 1.4%Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 2.4%Pt/AC catalysts with the respective optimal Pt loading, respectively. It was experimentally found that using CNTs in place of γ-Al2O3 or AC as the support of the catalyst did not cause a significant change in the apparent activation energy for the toluene HDA reaction but led to a slight increase in concentration of catalytically active Pt species (Pt0) at the surface of the functioning catalyst. In addition, the Pt/CNTs catalyst could reversibly adsorb a greater amount of hydrogen under atmospheric pressure at temperatures from room temperature to 573 K. This unique feature would help to generate a microenvironment with higher stationary state concentration of active hydrogen adspecies at the surface of the functioning catalyst. These effects favored the toluene HDA reaction.
