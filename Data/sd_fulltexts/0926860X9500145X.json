Box 252C, Hobart, Tas., 7005, Australia Received 17 January 1995; revised 25 May 1995; accepted 30 May 1995 Abstract A recently developed, highly selective, CuSiO2 catalyst for the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbon contaminants in C2 and C3 alkene streams has been employed to remove alkynes from an industrial C4 cracker stream. At a temperature of 320 and with approximately equal concentra- tions of H2 and C4 feed effectively all the contaminating alkynes and all the butadienes were hydro- genated selectively to butenes. No further hydrogenation of butenes to butanes was detected. The purified C4-stream was successfully employed in a butene dimerization reaction catalyzed by a homogeneous, Ziegler-type nickel catalyst system [Ni(dithioacetylacetonato) (WBu3)C1 + diethy- laluminiumchloride]. Prior to selective hydrogenation, alkynes present in the C4 stream had poisoned the nickel catalyst. After removing the contaminants dimerization proceeded with an activity ( 1480 turnovers/h) and product distribution in line with that observed using pure 1-butene feeds.

They are pro- duced almost exclusively by cracking naphtha, gas oils, ethane, propane and butanes [ 1,2]. Cracking processes, unfortunately, are limited in their selectivity and highly unsaturated alkynes (and dienes) are also produced in small quantities. The presence of highly reactive alkynes in alkene streams is generally undesirable because not only do alkynes give rise to undesirable side reactions and by-products, * Corresponding author.

Depending on the use of the alkene stream, dienes may also be regarded as contaminants. For example, a high purity (polymer grade) alkene stream for Ziegler-Natta catalyzed polyalkene formation must be essentially free from dienes and alkynes; typically, for a 1-butene stream; maximum desirable concentration for 1,3 butadiene (plus propadiene) is 10-100 ppm by volume and for methylacetylene (plus other acetylenes) 10 ppm by volume. [ 3,4 ] In previous studies we have developed extremely active Ziegler type, homoge- neous nickel-complex based catalyst systems for the dimerization/oligomerization of lower alkenes [ 5-7] The product obtained from the dimerization of 1-butene with these:catalysts has potential value in plasticizer manufacture or as possible octane enhancing additives for lead-free gasoline. In common with other Ziegler catalyst Systems these catalysts are sensitive to moisture, oxygen and various other nucleophilic reagents. Testing with a predried, deoxygenated industrial C4 stream also demonstrated the sensitivity of the catalyst systems to highly unsaturated hydrocarbons. Whereas, with pure 1-butene feed rapid and efficient dimerization occurred, the industrial stream gave no product. Alkynes in the C4 stream led to complete poisoning of the catalysts. In separate experiments it was shown that butadiene led to polymer formation [ 8 ]. Removal of these contaminants from the C4 hydrocarbon mix was therefore necessary before the oligomerisation catalysts could be used. A common method for the removal of unsaturated contaminants from hydrocar- bon streams is by catalytic hydrogenation. In this process the alkynes (and dienes) are selectively hydrogenated to alkenes, although for less selective catalysts some further hydrogenation to alkanes may occur. Therefore an effective hydrogenation catalyst not only removes contaminants but also increases the alkene content of the stream. Recently, a highly effective Cu/SiO2 catalyst system, prepared by an ion- exchange method has been developed by Trimm and co-workers [9,10]. This method of preparation gives ion-exchanged copper and small copper crystallites on the catalyst surface [9]. The ion-exchanged Cu/SiO2 catalyst system has shown promising results for the gas phase hydrogenation of C2-Ca alkynes [11-13]. However, the selective hydrogenation of an industrial Ca-stream and subsequent application of the stream in an alkyne sensitive reaction has not previously been reported. Accordingly, we report here the selective hydrogenation of alkynes and butadiene in a typical industrial Ca cracker stream using the ion-exchanged Cu/SiO2 catalyst system of Lee et al. [9]. Utilisation of the purified stream as feedstock in a butene dimerization reaction is also described. Dimerization was carried out with the homogeneous Ziegler type catalyst system; Ni(dithioacetylacetonato) [P(n- C4H9)3]C1 activated with (CH3CHz)2A1C1 as cocatalyst (Scheme 1 ). 1. Setiawan, K.J.

Hydrogenation catalysts Preparation and characterisation The method described by Kohler et al. [ 10] was followed for the preparation of Cu/SiO2 catalysts. The catalyst obtained was dried at 110 overnight and then calcined at 500 for 5 h. The calcined material was then ground and sieved (212- 250 /zm). Three types of silica supports were used: Aerosil-200, Aerosil-380 (DEGUSA) and Kieselgel-40 (MERCK). The catalysts prepared from these sup- ports are designated as Cu-200, Cu-380 and Cu-40 respectively. The surface areas were measured by nitrogen adsorption at - 195 using the standard BET method. Each sample was degassed at 160 under dynamic vacuum for 2 h before each measurement. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the catalysts were recorded with a modified AEI ES- 100 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with A1 Ka radiation and a Multi Channel Electron Multiplier Plate. The system was capable of gener- ating a vacuum of 10-la Torr ( 1 Torr= 133.3 Pa) and of measuring spectra with 1.5 eV resolution. Reduction and re-oxidation were carried out in situ at 250 with high purity hydrogen or oxygen. Binding energies were calibrated with ref- erence to the ls peak (284.6 eV) of carbon which originated from the diffusion of pump oil that inevitably contaminated the samples [ 14]. 2.2. Hydrogenation Hydrogenation was carried out in a tubular brass reactor measuring 55 mm long, 6 mm inner diameter and 25 mm outside diameter. The reactor was fitted with an external thermocouple well and was placed in a tubular heater (Helios No. 58768) which in turn was mounted vertically in an aluminium holder lined with insulating material. The temperature of the reactor was maintained ( _+ I) by a Fuji PYZ-4 temperature controller. Nitrogen and hydrogen flow-rates were controlled by flow controllers (Nupro). The flow-rate of the Ca-feed was controlled by a needle valve. Catalyst (0.5 g) was uniformly packed in the reactor between two plugs of glasswool and then reduced in a flowing mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen (25 ml/ min of each) at 250, typically for 12 h. After catalyst reduction the temperature was then set to that desired for the hydrogenation run. A steady flow of reactants (hydrogen and Ca-fraction without diluent) was obtained by by-passing the reactor for 15 min before switching the mixture through the reactor. (A typical gas chro- 228 1.

The support showed no activity except in the first few minutes when slight hydrogenation activity was observed (probably due to a small amount of hydrogen adsorbed on the support during the reduction stage). Gas sampling flasks were connected to the reactor's exit and exchanged at regular intervals. Gas samples were analyzed by a Hewlett Packard 5890 gas chromatograph fitted with a series-combination of a CP-Sil-5C column (0.53/zm X 25 m) and a 50-MXO column (0.32/zm X 50 m) and connected to a Hewlett Packard 3390A electronic integrator. Each product sample was diluted five-fold with high purity nitrogen before being injected into the columns via a 125 ~1 sample loop. Regeneration of used catalysts was undertaken by heating to 350 under a flowing mixture of 1:1 N2 and O2 (total flow = 50 ml/min) for 4 h immediately after the hydrogenation runs. The temperature was then reduced to 250 for the normal reduction process. After reduction the temperature was then set to the desired temperature for a hydrogenation run. 2.3. Testing purified C4-stream The nickel complex, [ Ni (dithioacetylacetonato) { P (n-C4H9) 3 } C1 ], was pre- pared by the method described previously [6]. The C4 stream used for the dimer- ization reaction was purified by hydrogenation at 320 over the Cu-380 catalyst using a 70 mls/min mixture of Ca and H2 in 4:3 molar ratio. The purified Ca stream was collected by condensing it in a collection tube (using an ethanol slush bath) which was one of an ensemble of two Fischer-Porter tubes (Fig. 1 ). For a typical dimerization test the following procedure was used: 5.4 g of the liquefied C4 product was condensed into the reaction tube and then 20 mg of the catalyst precursor [ Ni (dithioacetylacetonato) { P (n-C4H9) 3 } CI ], dissolved in 15 ml of chlorobenzene was then injected into the reaction tube, followed by the injection of ca. 0.3 ml (C2Hs)zA1C1 co-catalyst. The reaction tube was then withdrawn from the ethanol 1. Setiawan, K.J.

The decrease in the surface areas of Cu-380 and Cu-40 compared with those found for the original support materials (Aerosil-380 and Kieselgel-40) may be attributed to blocking of pores in the supports by the copper species. Because of the much larger surface areas of these supports the pores are likely to be much smaller than those in Aerosil-200. There- fore, the deposition of copper on the former supports is more likely to block the pores. The decrease in surface area of used catalyst (Cu-200) (Table 2), may be due to sintering of the copper species and/or surface coverage by green oil, an oligo- meric by-product of the hydrogenation [ 10]. After heating/degassing most of the green oil appeared to be removed, therefore the decrease in the surface area after this treatment, may be attributed primarily to sintering of the copper species. A further decrease in surface area was observed after the catalyst was regenerated and then re-used for the second time. The XPS spectra of unreduced (calcined) and reduced Cu-380 catalyst are typical of the spectra of all three catalysts studied; values of the binding energies are shown in Table 3. The spectrum for the calcined sample was collected over a much longer time to obtain signals comparable to those of the reduced sample, indicating that the concentration of copper on the surface of the reduced catalyst was much higher than that of calcined sample, probably due to surface aggregation of the copper species. For the unreduced catalysts, additional peaks at higher binding energies than the Cu (2p) peaks are observed. These are satellites of the 2p3/2 and 2pl/2 lines and are characteristic of Cu2 + species. The absence of these satellites in the reduced catalysts indicates that no Cu2+ is present. The disappearance of the satellites on reduction of the copper species is accompanied by a decrease in the width of each of the 2p lines and a shift of the binding energy of each line towards a slightly lower value. Kohler et al. [ 10] suggested that the ion-exchanged Cu2+ I. Setiawan, K.J. Cavell / Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 225-241 231 is not fully reduced to its metallic state, therefore it is most likely that the Cu (2p) peaks in the reduced catalysts originate from both Cut and Cuthe binding energies of which are usually very close together [ 15 ]. There is an indication that the higher the surface area of the silica from which the catalyst was prepared the more difficult it is to reduce the catalyst. This may be due to the higher concentration of ion- exchanged Cu2 + on the supports of higher surface area. The deposition of green oil on the surface of the catalysts was indicated by a considerable increase in the intensity of the C (ls) peak together with a decrease in the intensities ofCu (2p) peaks and the O (ls) peak. 3.2. Hydrogenation of the C4-stream Fig. 2 shows typical variations in product distributions with time on line. High hydrogenation activity and slightly lower selectivity with respect to butane for- mation was observed at the commencement of each run. This initial higher activity is clearly illustrated by an increase in the concentration of butenes and butanes with a concomitant decrease in the concentration of butadienes. Apart from this initial period, the concentration of butanes was constant throughout the rest of the run and was equal to the concentration of butanes in the feed, indicating the high selectivity of the catalyst towards the formation of butenes. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that under the hydrogenation conditions employed, initial effectiveness in removing the alkynes was high, it then decreased quite significantly after a few minutes on line. A possible explanation is that, after initial high activity, sites on the catalyst are gradually covered by green oil. The slow decrease in activity and the levelling off in selectivity may correspond to a situation in which the hydrogenation is governed by the rates of diffusion of the reactants from the gaseous stream onto the surface of the catalyst through a slowly increasing 6oj A ~ 40 o ota ,enes _~ 30' butenes ~u_ butanes ~>, 20 m 0 o 5'0 loo 1 200 Time on line (minutes) Fig. 2.

Similar behaviour observed for other hydrogenation catalysts has been explained by a combination of initial high accumulation of adsorbed hydrogen on the support and build up of carbonaceous foulant on the surface of the catalyst [12]. For a constant hydrogen flow-rate the extent of over-hydrogenation in the initial period of the reaction tended to increase with temperature. This may be attributed to an increase in the reaction rate as the temperature was increased. 3.3. Effectiveness in alkyne removal Fig. 4 shows clearly that the effectiveness of the catalysts (as measured by the removal of alkynes) increased dramatically as the temperature was increased from 100 to 120. A further increase in effectiveness was observed at higher tem- peratures although less marked. It can also be seen that catalysts prepared from the three different supports showed similar reactivity patterns. The similarity in catalyst performance may be explained in terms of the relative concentrations of bulk copper compared with the total copper concentration in the catalysts. Kohler et al. [ 10] have reported that ion-exchanged copper does not seem to be the active species and that the likely active species for hydrogenation comes predominantly from the bulk copper. Since the ion-exchanged copper does not appear to be fully reduced to copper metal on hydrogenation it is possible that the surface areas of bulk copper in each of the catalysts is very similar and therefore the three catalysts showed similar performance. Initially, the amount of butadiene hydrogenated increased with temperature, after about 200, however, the concentrations of butadiene in the product stream tended to increase with temperature. This behaviour may be a consequence of different 1. Setiawan, K.J.

Kummerow et al. [16] have reported that in the selective hydrogenation of a similar Ca-stream over a Cu/ alumina catalyst, deactivation by polymerization (green oil) is important at low temperatures whereas at high temperatures deactivation by coking was significant. 3.4. The effects of hydrogen concentration The surface concentration of hydrogen has an important effect on hydrogenation. Takeuchi et al. [ 17] has suggested that the activity of a catalyst in promoting hydrogenation depends on its ability to adsorb hydrogen in competition with other reactants. The significance of hydrogen physisorption for its chemisorption on copper is even more important since copper has a low hydrogen adsorption capacity. It was assumed that an increase in adsorbed hydrogen could be obtained by increas- ing the partial pressure of hydrogen in the reacting mixture. Fig. 5 shows that the concentration of butenes in the product increased with hydrogen concentration and it is evident from Fig. 6 that more butadiene was hydrogenated with higher con- centrations of hydrogen and more importantly all the butadiene was selectively hydrogenated to butenes without further hydrogenation to butanes even with flows containing 43 mol% of hydrogen. The butene concentration of 90% obtained with 43 mol% of hydrogen is the maximum possible concentration and corresponds to complete hydrogenation of the butadienes and the alkynes. The constant high selectivity of this catalyst regardless of hydrogen concentration is in agreement with the observations of Mann and Khulbe [ 18] regarding the hydrogenation of propyne over an unsupported copper catalyst. For hydrogen concentrations up to 22 mol-% the plot of butene concentration followed the same pattern displayed in 234 1. Setiawan, K.J.

As the flow of hydrogen was increased above this value the butenes con- centration hump (point A, Fig. 2), however, disappeared. Explanations for the high selectivity of these Cu/SiO2 catalysts include the following. Based on the argument proposed by Bond et al. [ 19], it is possible that the activity of the Cu/SiO2 catalyst system for the hydrogenation of butenes is low relative to the rate of butene desorption. Thus, as soon as butenes are formed from the hydrogenation of alkyne/butadiene they are desorbed from the surface of the catalyst providing no chance for further hydrogenation of the butenes to occur. This rapid desorption of butenes could only be possible if alkynes and/or butadienes are more strongly adsorbed onto the surface of the catalyst than butenes.

Relative amounts of butene isomers as products from the hydrogenation of the C4 stream with varying hydrogen concentrations (Cu-380; C4- 40 ml/min; T= 320; samples were taken after 120 min). catalysts, however, the heats of adsorption of butadiene and butenes are of the same order of magnitude, as has been suggested for their adsorption on a Pt/SiO2 catalyst. If this were the case for the Cu/SiO2 catalysts, the high selectivity could be explained by the mechanism of Boitiaux et al. [20]. In this proposal the pathway leading to butane production, via syn-adsorbed butadiene, also generates cis-2- butene. Consequently, hydrogenation of butadiene on this catalyst must follow a path in which the syn-adsorbed conformation and the interconversion of trans-2- butene to cis-2-butene is so low that almost no butanes are produced. A plot of butene isomers obtained from hydrogenation versus hydrogen concentration is shown in Fig. 7. It is apparent that the main (and steadily increasing) products formed in the hydrogenation process are l-butene and/or trans-2-butene. However, there is also a steady but more gradual increase in cis-2-butene concentration. It has been suggested [21 ] that 2-butenes are generally produced via the prelim- inary formation of 1-butene followed by its subsequent isomerisation before desorp- tion. Metals which are poor alkene isomerisation catalysts such as copper should give 1-butene as the major product from butadiene hydrogenation [ 21 ]. However, small but significant quantities of cis-2-butene are produced in the reaction ( Fig. 7). All runs with hydrogen concentrations higher than 6.5 mol-%, showed that the catalysts approach 100% efficiency for alkyne removal even after 3 h on line, and with 38 mol-%, of hydrogen no alkynes could be detected in the product stream even after 7 h on line. It has been suggested for the hydrogenation of ethyne over a similar catalyst system [ 12] that the formation of polymeric foulant (green oil) is proportional to the extent of hydrogenation. That is, both green oil formation and ethyne hydro- genation show first order kinetics with respect to hydrogen. This would have the consequence that the amount of green oil would increase with increased hydrogen 236 L Setiawan, K.J.

On the other hand, the formation of green oil was found to be independent of hydrogen concentration for the hydrogenation of propyne over the Cu/SiO2 catalyst system [ 10]. In both cases the amount of green oil formed was significant, in the latter case however, its formation was markedly reduced with increased temperature and added propene. In the present study, because of the scale of the operation it was not possible to quantify the amount of green oil formed during catalysis However, it was estimated that the green oil produced during a three hour run would not exceed 0.5 g which is approximately 3% of the total weight of the Ca-fraction. The notable absence of significant amounts of green oil in the trap attached to the bottom of the reactor, during hydrogenation runs with high hydrogen concentrations, indicated that less green oil was produced under these conditions. This is consistent with the high efficiency of the Cu/SiO2 catalyst system for alkyne removal observed under the reaction conditions. Thus, in contrast to the formation of green oil in the hydrogen- ation of ethyne and propyne which tend in one case to increase and in the second case to stay constant with increased hydrogen concentrations, the formation of green oil in the hydrogenation of the Ca-stream appeared to decrease with increased hydrogen concentrations. The decreased deactivation of the catalyst at high hydrogen concentrations could be understood if the hydrogenation of alkynes and their polymerisation are consid- ered to be in competition. The following order for ease of polymerisation may be proposed [21-25]: vinylacetylene > methylacetylene > ethylacetylene. Vinyla- cetylene tends to polymerise upon heating even in the absence of a catalyst [22]. Moreover, since vinylacetylene is present in the highest concentration in the Ca- stream under study (85% of total alkynes) Scheme 2, depicting vinylacetylene hydrogenation and polymerisation, could be considered as being representative of the whole deactivation mechanism. From Scheme 2 it can be seen that an increase in hydrogen surface concentration, as a consequence of increased hydrogen con- centrations, would favour the hydrogenation reaction and inhibit the polymerisation and hence the deactivation of the catalyst. Similar schemes for both methylacetylene and ethylacetylene may be described. Investigating the hydrogenation of ethyne over the same catalyst system, Sta- mmbach et al. [12] analyzed the green oil formed and detected the presence of benzene, ethylbenzene and even numbered alkenes and aromatic compounds. Sar- kany et al. [26] also found -COOH functional groups in the green oil produced from the hydrogenation of a Ca-stream over Pd/alumina catalyst. The mass spec- trum of the green oil produced in our studies indicated the presence of both cyclic I. Setiawan, K.J.

The presence of unsaturated polymeric hydrocarbons was also apparent. The infrared spectrum of the green oil also indicates the presence of an -OH functional group as found by Sarkany et al. [26]. Green oil was presumably produced from the cyclisation and polymerization of the alkynes and perhaps 1,3- butadiene. To investigate the efficiency of catalyst regeneration several runs were done with regenerated catalysts. The used catalyst was reoxidized at 350 with a 50 ml/min mixture of nitrogen and oxygen (in 1 : 1 molar ratio). The reoxidation was normally carried out for 4 h. To ensure reproducibility this procedure was strictly followed for each regeneration undertaken. Fig. 8 compares the performance of fresh and regenerated catalysts. In all cases the performance of the regenerated catalysts was not as good as the fresh ones. Support micropores and copper surfaces of the regenerated catalysts may retain some deposited foulant which was not completely burnt off by the regeneration procedure, or some sintering of copper may have occurred during regeneration. Subsequent regenerations led to small decreases in hydrogenation performance. No attempt was made to optimise regeneration procedures, and hence more extensive studies were not undertaken. Catalysts were operated up to eight hours -- longer life-time studies were not carried out. 3.5. Catalytic dimerization of the purified C4-stream The oligomerisation/polymerisation of alkenes can be regarded as one of the most important reaction classes in the petrochemical industry. The discovery of 238 L Setiawan, K.J. Cavell/Applied Catalysis A: General 131 fl995)225 241 Ziegler-Natta polymerisation catalysts was the cornerstone of the polymer industry. Ziegler-type catalysts are in general prepared by the reaction of a transition metal complex with a main group organometallic compound (mostly alkylaluminium compounds) [27]. The generally accepted mechanism for the action of this type of catalyst is chain growth through alkene insertion and chain termination via/3- hydrogen abstraction/elimination. [28] The extent of polymerisation is determined by the relative rates of alkene insertion and/3-hydrogen abstraction. With the correct choice of catalyst type and reaction conditions it is possible to tailor catalysts to give dimers as the main products. The stabilities of adsorbed hydrocarbons on the surface of a metal are related to the stabilities of their organometallic complexes. Alkynes are normally very strongly adsorbed and can displace alkenes on a metal surface. This idea can be extended to an intermediate which is involved in a homogeneously catalyzed reac- tion. The presence of alkynes in an alkene feedstock may inhibit a reaction employ- ing a Ziegler-type catalyst by forming a relatively stable complex with the metal centre, thus occupying the vacant coordination site and preventing alkene coordi- nation and insertion. We have found in earlier studies that catalyst systems of the type [Ni(dithioacetylacetonato) (phosphine) Cl or Ni(monothioacetylacetonato) (phosphine)C1 + alkylaluminiumhalide cocata- lyst] have moderate activities for the dimerization of pure butene feed [5,8]. Reaction with pure 1,3-butadiene gave polybutadiene [8]. When a predried, deox- ygenated industrial Ca cracker stream was used as feed no activity was observed. Furthermore, addition of small amounts of an alkyne to pure 1-butene, prior to adding the nickel-Ziegler catalyst system, prevented effective catalysis and addition of an alkyne to an operating catalyst system led to catalyst deactivation within seconds. It was apparent from these studies that alkyne (and butadiene) removal was essential if butene dimerization of the cracker stream was to be carried out. Hydrogenation of the cracker stream in the manner described resulted in a mixture of butenes (ca. 90%) and butanes with no butadienes or alkynes and was therefore suitable for use with the Ziegler-type, dimerization catalyst system. Reaction of the purified C4 mixture with the nickel catalyst system is illustrated in Fig. 9. Very rapid reaction occurred during the first 30 min, the activity then decreased. (This behaviour is consistent with that observed when pure 1-butene feed was used.) The average activity of the catalyst system over the first 30 min was 1480 moles butenes consumed/mole of catalyst/hour. The main components of the Cs-dimer product were branched dimers, as analyzed by GC-mass spectrometry, which is in agree- ment with previous studies on propene dimerization [28,6,7]. Cavell and Masters [ 6 ] noted that alkene isomerisation occurs concurrently with oligomerisation for these Ziegler type catalyst systems. As can be seen from Fig. 9 the initial dimerization was accompanied by isomerisation. The concentration of 1-butene decreased very rapidly since it is 1 -butene which is more readily dimerized 1.

The proposed reaction sequence is shown; 2 - butenes ~ ! - butene -~ C8 - dimers Fig. 9 also shows the presence ofC7 co-dimers probably formed from the coreac- tion of propene generated by the hydrogenation of propyne present in the original C4-fraction. The formation of these CT-co-dimers was complete in the first few minutes of the reaction. A very small amount, which remained essentially constant throughout the reaction, of C6-dimers was also detected. This indicates that the activities for C3 dimerization and for C3-C4 co-dimerization are higher than that for C4 dimerization as may be expected [6,7]. 4. Conclusions This study has shown that the activity and efficiency of the Cu/SiO2 catalyst system towards removal of alkynes (and dienes) in the C4-stream increases with temperature, a dramatic increase in activity was noted from 100 to 120, and with increasing hydrogen concentration. The catalyst system shows high selectivity, no butanes were formed even at high hydrogen concentrations. Although regener- ated catalysts did not perform as well as fresh ones, a significant increase in catalyst life was observed with high hydrogen concentrations. The extent of hydrogenation of butadiene showed a maximum value at about 200 (with H2:alkyne ratio = 4:1 ). At higher temperatures less hydrogenation of 240 1. Setiawan, K.J. Cavell/Applied CatalysisA: General 131 (1995) 225 241 butadienes was observed, presumably due to different deactivation mechanisms operating at low ( < 200) and at high ( > 200) temperatures. It has also been clearly demonstrated that alkynes present in the industrial C4 cracker stream poison Ziegler-type dimerization catalysts. Efficient removal of the contaminants using the Cu/SiO2 hydrogenation catalyst of Trimm et al. allows the Ziegler-type systems to be operated with normal effectiveness.

A recently developed, highly selective, CuSiO2 catalyst for the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbon contaminants in C2 and C3 alkene streams has been employed to remove alkynes from an industrial C4 cracker stream. At a temperature of 320°C and with approximately equal concentrations of H2 and C4 feed effectively all the contaminating alkynes and all the butadienes were hydrogenated selectively to butenes. No further hydrogenation of butenes to butanes was detected. The purified C4-stream was successfully employed in a butene dimerization reaction catalyzed by a homogeneous, Ziegler-type nickel catalyst system [Ni (dithioacetylacetonato) (PnBu3) Cl + diethylaluminiumchloride]. Prior to selective hydrogenation, alkynes present in the C4 stream had poisoned the nickel catalyst. After removing the contaminants dimerization proceeded with an activity (1480 turnovers/h) and product distribution in line with that observed using pure 1-butene feeds.
