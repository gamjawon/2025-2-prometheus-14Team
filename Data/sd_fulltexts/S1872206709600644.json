This method provides an efficient and much improved modification over the reported methods in terms of yield, reaction time, and work-up procedure. A wide variety of substituents is tolerated, which is not the case for existing procedures. Key words: N-formylation; Amberlite IR-120; formic acid; amine; microwave Since the first report by Fieser et al. [1] on the N-formylation of amines, a number of strategies have been developed for their synthesis because of their importance as intermediates in the preparation of several fine chemicals [1] and pharmaceutically important compounds such as substituted aryl imidazoles [2], 1,2-dihydroquinolines [3], fluoroquinolines [4], nitrogen- bridged heterocycles [5], etc. Formamides act as catalysts in the allylation [6] and hydrosilylation [7] reaction of carbonyl compounds. The asymmetric allylation of aldehydes using chiral formamides has also been reported recently [8]. For- mamides serve as very useful reagents in Vilsmeier formyla- tion [9] and in the synthesis of formamidines and isocyanides [10]. In addition, a formyl group is used for the protection of the amino group during peptide synthesis [11,12]. Generally, the N-formylation of amines can be carried out using the esters of formic acid such as pentafluorophenyl formate and phenyl formate for direct N-formylation in the absence of a catalyst [13,14]. Apart from this, aryl formates and ethyl formate are useful for N-formylation in the presence of catalysts like TiCl 3 (OTf) [15] and silica-bonded N-propylsulfamic acid [16]. Chandra Shekhar et al. [17] have recently reported the N-formylation of amines using ZnCl 2 as a catalyst, where the reaction requires a longer time for comple- tion. In addition to the above-mentioned reports, a number of other methods have been documented on the N-formylation of amines [18–20]. Many of the N-formylation methods have disadvantages such as the use of expensive reagents, the for- mation of side products, thermal instability, and difficult to access reagents. Therefore, the pursuit of more convenient and practical synthetic methods for these compounds still remains an active research area. On the other hand, a “green” reaction should ideally be conducted under solvent-free conditions with minimal or no side products and with the utmost atom economy [21]. One way to achieve this is by microwave heating. It is also well known that microwave heating dramatically accelerates the rate of many organic reactions and improves yields, and the reactions are highly selective [22–27]. Because of these ad- vantages there is great interest in the use of environmentally benign reagents and procedures [28]. Recently, the use of solid acidic catalysts has gained im- portance in organic synthesis because of several advantages such as operational simplicity, non-toxicity, reusability, low cost, and ease of separation after completion of the reaction [29–32]. Amberlite IR-120[H + ] resin has emerged as an effi- cient heterogeneous catalyst for various organic reactions [33]. Because of the numerous advantages associated with this in- expensive and non-hazardous recyclable catalyst we herein report a protocol for a solvent-free reaction using microwave activation for the synthesis of N-formamides using Amberlite IR-120 as a catalyst. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the N-formylation of amines with formic acid where the reaction is catalyzed by a reusable resin. The method Madhusudana Reddy MUTHUKUR BHOJEGOWD et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 518–520 is very simple as the resin can be filtered from the reaction mixture and simple evaporation of the solvent (used for washing the product) gives the desired product. The chemicals used are commercially available. All the re- actions were carried out in an LG domestic unmodified mi- crowave oven (Model MS-1947C/01 230V/320W/2450 MHz). Melting points were determined using a Büchi apparatus. Nu- clear magnetic resonance spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz Bruker AMX spectrometer in CDCl 3 using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. GC-mass spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu GC-MS QP 5050A instrument equipped with a 30 m length and 0.32 mm diameter BP-5 column and the column temperature was 80–15–250 °C. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu FT-IR-8400s spectropho- tometer with KBr pellets for solids and thin films between NaCl plates for liquids. Amine (2 mmol) and Amberlite IR-120 (100 mg) were placed in a 10 ml Pyrex glass tube and formic acid (0.22 ml, 6 mmol) was then added with constant mixing for 1 min. The reaction was subjected to microwave irradiation for an appro- priate time at 320 W with 20 s intervals. The progress of the reaction was monitored with thin layer chromatography using 80% hexane-20% ethyl acetate as the mobile phase and the reaction was allowed to continue until the amine was fully consumed. When the reaction was complete, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and 5 ml ethyl acetate was added. The catalyst was then filtered, washed with an additional 5 ml of ethyl acetate, and dried at 150 °C for 3 h before further use. The filtrate was washed with a saturated solution of NaHCO 3 (5 ml) and then with water (5 ml) and was dried over anhydrous MgSO 4 . The filtrate was then concentrated under vacuum. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica gel 100–200 mesh, ethyl acetate:hexane of 1:10) to obtain the corresponding N-formyl derivatives in pure form.

To further investigate the synthesis of biologically important compounds using simple, efficient, non-toxic, and readily available catalysts [34,35], we report on a simple and efficient procedure for the N-formylation of amines with formic acid using non-toxic, environmentally friendly, and reusable Am- berlite IR-120 as a catalyst under solvent-free microwave irradiation conditions. To optimize the reaction conditions and the catalytic activity of Amberlite IR-120, the reaction of 4-chloroaniline was se- lected as a model reaction. In our study, no reaction was ob- served when a mixture of 4-chloroaniline and formic acid was heated at 480 W in a microwave oven, even after 180 s. However, the addition of a catalytic amount of Amberlite IR-120 (100 mg) to this mixture rapidly induced the N-formylation and formanilide was produced in 95% yield at 320 W in 60 s. Based on these results and to investigate the scope and limitations of the reaction, various amines were subjected to this novel formylation reaction. The results are presented in Table 1. From this table it is clear that the reactions proceeded well irrespective of the substituents and the conversions were complete within 60–120 s. It is also clear that anilines con- taining electron donating substituents such as –CH 3 , –OCH 3 , –OH, and –N,N(CH 3 ) 2 (entries 2–4, 13, 14, and 19) and elec- tron withdrawing groups such as –NO 2 and halides (entries 6–11) afforded the corresponding N-formamides in excellent yields. It is noteworthy that anilines having the keto and car- boxyl substituents (entries 15 and 16) and secondary amines (entry 17) were also good substrates for the reaction.

All the compounds are known and their physical properties are the same as the reported values. 1 H NMR, IR, and mass spectral data of all the products match the reported data. Madhusudana Reddy MUTHUKUR BHOJEGOWD et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 518–520 protocol was successfully applied to aliphatic amines such as n-butylamine (entry 18). The structures of all the synthesized compounds were confirmed spectroscopically and found to be comparable in all respects with pure samples. Finally, we checked the reusability of the Amberlite IR-120 catalyst in the reaction of 4-chloroaniline with formic acid under the optimized conditions. After the completion of the reaction, ethylacetate was added and the insoluble catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by filtration. The catalyst was washed with ethylacetate several times and dried for fur- ther use. The results of five runs showed that the recovered catalyst retains its activity in terms of yields of 95%, 92%, 93%, 89%, and 90%, respectively. In conclusion, we developed a mild and selective method for the N-formylation of a variety of amines. This method has a number of advantages including low cost, reagent availability, easy handling, reusability of the catalyst, and ease of operation and workup. This novel N-formylation process can potentially be applied widely for the N-formylation of amines in organic synthesis. References 1 Fieser L F, Jones J E.
