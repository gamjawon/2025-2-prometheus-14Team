Corma *, A. Martfnez, C. Martinez lnstituto de Tecnologfa Qufmica, UPV-CSIC, Universidad Polit~cnica de Valencia. At,da. de los Naranjos s / n, 46022 Valencia, Spain Received 18 December 1995; revised 10 March 1996, accepted 10 March 1996 Abstract The activity, selectivity, and deactivation behavior of sulfated ZrO2, TiO2, and SnO2 catalysts during the liquid phase alkylation of isobutane with 2-butene at 32 have been studied as a function of the sulfate source, i.e., sulfuric acid and ammonium sulfate, sulfate concentration, and calcination temperature. It has been shown that, for each metal oxide, the optimum calcination temperature giving maximum activity depends on both the source of sulfur and the sulfur concentration used during the impregnation step. Moreover, when the most active preparations of each sulfated oxide are compared, it is shown that the initial activity decreases in the order: O)- ~- . S ~ /ZrO2 >~ SO2 /TIO2 > SO42-/SNO2, which is the expected trend of acid strength. However, owing to the higher strength of the acid sites, the former two catalysts present a very high initial cracking activity, thus affording low selectivities to the desired trimethylpentanes (TMP). It has also been shown that a certain loss of sulfates (between 0 and 30% of the initial sulfates for most of the preparations) takes place during the alkylation reaction on the three sulfated metal oxides. Sulfate decomposition is suggested to occur by chemical interaction of the butene molecules present in the feed with some surface sulfates.

Corma et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 249-268 sulfated zirconia showing the highest acid strength (H0 ~< -16.04) is able to isomerize n-butane at low reaction temperatures [6-15] allowing to obtain high yields of isoparaffins, while minimizing unwanted reactions, such as the crack- ing of butanes into less valuable products. The extremely high activity of sulfated zirconia is thought to be due to the formation of very strong acid sites upon introduction of sulfate into the amorphous hydroxide and calcination at temperatures between 400 and 700. Recently it has been shown [16] that catalytically active sulfated zirconia can also be prepared by sulfation of a YeO3-stabilized tetragonal ZrO2 phase. The acidity of these materials, as measured by Hammett indicators, was seen to be higher than that of 100% sulfuric acid, and in this sense they have been considered as 'superacids'. Nevertheless, the nature of the acidity and structure of the acid sites have not been clearly established, and is still a matter of discussion in the literature [3,4,6,8-10,12,17-25]. Moreover, it has been recently proposed [26] that sul- fated zirconia can be visualized as sulfuric acid adsorbed onto the surface of zirconia, with different sulfate species being formed in a reversible way depending on the water content. In accordance with this, it was proposed [26] that the acidity of sulfated zirconia is similar to that of sulfuric acid, and consequently, it cannot be considered as a superacid solid. A similar conclusion was drawn by Umansky et al. [27] who measured the acid strength of sulfated zirconia by using a modified spectrophotometric technique instead of the usual observation of color change of Hammett indicators. The physicochemical and catalytic properties of sulfated zirconia were shown to be strongly influenced by the method of preparation of the catalyst [3,4,8,9,16,19,28-34]. Thus, the conditions (starting salt, final pH of precipita- tion, and the rate of addition of the base) for obtaining the hydroxide, thermal treatment of the hydroxide before sulfation, concentration of sulfate during the impregnation step, and the final calcination temperature are all important parameters determining the final catalytic properties of sulfated zirconia. Besides sulfated zirconia, other sulfated metal oxides, such as SO42-/TIO2, SO~-/SnO2, SO42-/Fe203, and SO2-/A1203, were also prepared and proved to be active for acid demanding reactions [3-5,35], although the acid strength of the latter catalysts, measured by Hammett indicators [3,4] or by TPD of adsorbed pyridine [36], was seen to be lower than that of sulfated zirconia. These differences in acid strength have been related to differences in the electronegativity of the metal present in the sulfated metal oxide. Moreover, the influence of preparation conditions on the catalytic properties of these sulfated metal oxides have been much less studied as compared to sulfated zirconia. Owing to the high catalytic activity of sulfated zirconia, it has also been examined as catalyst for isobutane alkylation in order to replace the harmful hydrofluoric and sulfuric acids used in the commercial alkylation plants [37]. Development of environmental friendly solid alkylation catalysts could help to increase alkylation capacity to meet the new specifications of reformulated A. Corma et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 249-268 251 gasoline. We have previously shown [38,39] that at the usual alkylation tempera- tures (30-80) sulfated zirconia produced a very large amount of cracking products, C5-C7, during the initial reaction stages, resulting in a loss of alkylation selectivity and a fast catalyst decay. This was related to the presence of very strong acid sites on the surface of sulfated zirconia, and lower reaction temperatures were required to decrease the undesired cracking reactions. On the other hand, the influence of preparation conditions and the nature of the metal cation in the activity and selectivity of sulfated metal oxides for isobutane/butene alkylation have been little investigated. Guo et al. [40] studied the influence of calcination temperature on SO4~-/ZrO~ and SOS~-/T102\" cata- lysts prepared by immersing zirconium hydroxide and titanic acid into 0.5 M H2SO4 solution for isobutane/butene alkylation under gas phase conditions and unusually high (50-200) reaction temperatures. These authors found a corre- lation between the acid strength, given by the Ho value, of catalysts calcined at different temperatures and their alkylation ability, which was measured by the oil yield. However, the product distribution was not given and consequently, it was not possible to know how much of the oil product was formed via aikylation and butene dimerization. We have recently presented [41] that under usual alkylation conditions the nature of the metal cation has a clear influence on the activity and product distribution of sulfated metal oxides for isobutane/2-butene alkylation. Thus, the order of activity found was: SO4-/ZrO2 > SO2 /TiO2 > SO4-/SnO2 > S04-/Fe203 > SO4-/AleO3. The latter two catalysts were seen to give a low alkylation activity, being mostly active for olefin dimerization. However, all these catalysts were prepared from H2SO4 (0.5 M) and calcined at 550, which are probably not the optimum preparation conditions for each sulfated oxide. In this paper we report a detailed study on the influence of sulfation conditions (source and concentration of SO4-) and calcination temperature (450-650 range) used during the preparation of the most active SO42--/ZRO2, SOj /TiO~, and SO2-/SNO2 catalysts, on the initial activity, product selectiv- ity, and catalyst decay of these sulfated metal oxides for the liquid phase alkylation of isobutane with 2-butene at a reaction temperature of 32. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of catalysts Sulfated oxides were obtained from the corresponding hydroxides, by hydrol- ysis of a 0.4 M aqueous solution of the metal precursor with NH4OH (25 wt.-% in water) at room temperature and vigorous stirring, at a given final pH. The precursors and final pH of precipitation used for the different metals were the following: ZrOC1e8H20 and pH 8.3 for Zr(OH)4, (i-C3HTO)4Ti and pH 7.0 252 A. Corma et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 249-268 for Ti(OH)4, and SnC14.5H20 and pH 9.3 for Sn(OH)4. The precipitates were extensively washed with deionized water, and dried at 160 for 16 h. Then, sulfation of the amorphous hydroxides was carried out by two different procedures: (i) treatment with sulfuric acid (0.5 M) (5 cm3 of acid solution per 1 g of solid) at room temperature for 1 h with agitation, followed by filtration and drying at 160 for 16 h (samples denoted as 1S-Me, Me = Zr, Ti, or Sn); (ii) impregnation (incipient wetness technique) with an aqueous solution of ammonium sulfate (AS) with two different sulfate concentrations, i.e., 6 and 9 wt.-% SO2- on a dry basis (samples denoted as 6AS-Me and 9AS-Me, respectively). Finally, all the samples were calcined in air flow (20 cm3/min) at tempera- tures in the 450-650 range for 3 h. 2.2. Characterization of catalysts X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected in a Phillips PW 1830 diffractometer using nickel-filtered CuK,~ radiation (h = 0.1542 nm). The BET surface area was obtained in an ASAP 2000 apparatus from the nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 K, and a value of 0.164 nm2 was taken for the cross-section of nitrogen. The sulfur content of the sulfated hydroxides and the calcined sulfated oxides were measured in an elemental analyzer EAII08 (Fisons) coupled with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 2.3. Reaction system and procedure The alkylation experiments were carried out in an automated fixed-bed stainless-steel reactor at a reaction temperature of 32 and total pressure of 2.5 MPa, so both reactants and products were maintained in the liquid phase. Liquid isobutane ( > 99% pure) and liquid trans-2-butene ( > 99% pure) were fed at the desired flow rate by means of two independent piston-type pumps. An isobu- tane/2-butene molar ratio of 15 was used for these experiments. The feed mixture was first by-passed and analyzed in a GC until a constant composition was achieved while the reactor was kept under nitrogen at the reaction pressure. Then, the isobutane/butene mixture was passed through the catalyst bed, and the product stream was depressurized at the reactor outlet by means of a valve, and heated at 200 before going to the sampling system. This is formed by a multiloop valve (8 loops, 1 ml volume each), which allows to collect samples from very short (1 rain) to larger times on stream (TOS). A more detailed description of the reaction system and procedure can be found elsewhere [38]. After the reaction, all the loops were automatically analyzed in a GC, where the different compounds are separated in a capillary column (fused silica, 100 m A. Corma et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 249-268 253 length, Supelco), and identified by GS-MS and reference standards. Catalyst particles of 0.59-0.84 mm diameter were diluted with inert silica (50/50 by weight) before being loaded into the reactor. The olefin space velocity, WHSV, was kept to 2 h-~ in the experiments. The sulfated hydroxides were calcined 'ex-situ' at the desired temperature, and transferred to the reactor for the catalytic measurements. Then, they were activated 'in situ' at 450 for 1 h in nitrogen flow before the catalytic measurements. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Characterization The sulfur content of the sulfated hydroxides and the calcined samples and the BET surface area of the final sulfated metal oxides are presented in Tables 1-3. Impregnation with ammonium sulfate leads to similar sulfur contents in the sulfated Zr, Ti, and Sn hydroxides, whereas the amount of sulfate incorporated by treatment with 0.5 M sulfuric acid strongly depends on the characteristics of the metal hydroxide. This is much higher for the Zr(OH)4 sample than for Ti(OH)4 and Sn(OH)4, which can be related with a higher concentration of OH groups on the surface of the former hydroxide. In all the cases, both the sulfur content and surface area decrease when increasing the temperature of calcination of the sulfated hydroxides, irrespective of the method of preparation and sulfate concentration. In general, the relative amount of sulfur retained in the sulfated oxides after calcination increases as the amount of sulfur incorporated in the amorphous hydroxides decreases. Thus, the relative loss of sulfur species after calcination at a given temperature is lowest for the 6AS samples in the case of Table 1 Sulfur content and BET surface area of SO2 /ZrO2 catalysts as a incorporation and calcination temperature function of the method of sulfate Sulfated hydroxides Sulfated oxides Method of SO42- incorporation wt.- % Sulfur Calcination wt.-% BET surface temperature Sulfur area (m2/g) () 0.5 M H2SO4 3.0 (NH4)2SO4 (6 wt.-% sulfate) 1.6 (NH4)2SO4 (9 wt.-% sulfate) 3.1 500 3.4 142 550 2.5 132 600 1.8 103 650 1.4 98 500 2.0 140 550 1.9 127 600 1.7 115 500 3.4 154 550 3.2 122 600 2.4 118 254 A.

These results are in agreement with previous observa- tions showing that the thermal stability of sulfates in sulfated zirconia decreases as the sulfur content increases [9], probably because at high sulfur loadings different types of sulfate species with a different degree of interaction with the oxide are formed. The XRD patterns of the calcined SO42-/ZRO2 catalysts showed the presence of a nearly pure tetragonal phase, with the exception of sample 9AS-Zr(500), for Table 3 Sulfur content and BET surface area of SO42 /SnO2 catalysts as a incorporation and calcination temperature function of the method of sulfate Sulfated hydroxides Sulfated oxides Method of SO42- incorporation wt.-% Sulfur Calcination wt.-% BET surface temperature Sulfur area (m2/g) () 0.5 M H2SO4 1.2 (NH a)2 SOa (6 wt.-% sulfate) 2.1 (NH4)2SO4 (9 wt.-% sulfate) 2.4 500 1.4 124 550 1.3 120 600 1.3 100 500 1.7 134 550 1.6 126 600 1.4 103 500 2.3 144 550 1.8 115 600 1.2 93 A.

Moreover, the elemental analysis of this sample revealed the presence of 0.125 wt.-% N, indicating incomplete decomposition of the ammonium sulfate after calcining at 500. For the other samples, the crystallinity of the zirconium oxide increased with calcination temperature, irrespective of the method of preparation. This effect is also related with an increase of the crystal size, leading to the decrease of surface area observed as the calcination temperature increases. In the case of SO2-/TiO2, all the samples show the anatase structure, except the sample prepared from 0.5 M sulfuric acid and calcined at 650, which shows a diffraction pattern corre- sponding to rutile. Since the presence of sulfate on the surface of the oxide is known to stabilize the anatase phase at higher temperatures [4], the almost complete loss of sulfur species experienced by this sample during calcination (Table 2) may explain the phase transformation observed by XRD. The crys- tallinity of SOj-/TiO2 also increases with calcination temperature, and is higher for the catalysts prepared from 0.5 M HzSO4, which can explain the lower surface areas obtained for this series of samples. With respect to the SO4-/SnO2 catalysts, the only crystalline phase observed was cassiterite. Moreover, the increase of crystallinity with calcination temperature, as well as the differences in crystallinity between the different preparations, were much lower for this oxide than for zirconia and titania. 3.2. Catalytic measurements 3.2.1. lnitial activity and selectivity The initial (1 rain TOS) 2-butene conversion obtained on the different sulfated metal oxides is shown in Figs. 1-3 as a function of calcination temperature.

For instance, with samples 1S-Zr and 6AS-Zr having similar final sulfur contents, not only the former gives a much larger catalytic activity, but the maximum is shifted towards a higher activation temperature. Meanwhile, series 6AS-Zr and 9AS-Zr, both obtained from ammonium sulfate but with different sulfur contents, give a maximum in activity for calcination temperatures between 500 and 600, but the 9AS-Zr series show a higher activity than 6AS-Zr.

Corma et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 249-268 257 compounds and calcined at the same conditions, as it is frequently done, can be quite misleading, since as it has been presented here for SO42-/ZrO2, SO42-/TiO2 and SO42-/SnO2 samples prepared by sulfation with ammonium sulfate and sulfuric acid require different calcination temperatures to obtain maximum activity (Figs. 1-3). In a similar way, and from the results presented in Figs. 1-3, it does not make sense to compare the catalytic activity of different sulfated oxides calcined at the same conditions as it is usually done. It is clear that each one of them requires a different calcination temperature for maximiz- ing activity, which in turn depends on the method of sulfate incorporation and sulfur content. Thus, the optimum calcination temperature of SO42-/ZrO2 and SO~ /TiO2 catalysts is in the range of 500-600, while it is shifted towards lower calcination temperatures (450-550) in the case of SO4-/SnO2. If the most active catalysts of each sulfated metal oxide are compared, it can be said that the initial activity decreases in the order: SO42-/ZrO2> SO~-/TiO2 > SO2-/SNO2, which is the expected order taking into account the acid strength measured by means of Hammett indicators [3,4]. However, it should be considered that not all the butene converted yields alkylation products, i.e., TMP, but other products coming from competing reactions, such as butene dimerization/oligomerization, consecutive alkylation of Cs products leading to heavier compounds (C9+), and cracking of these heavier products into light ends, C5-C7, are also occurring during isobutane/2-butene alkylation [37]. In order to discuss this, the initial product distribution obtained on the different sulfated metal oxides is given in Tables 4-6 for SO42-/ZrO2, SO4-/TiO2, and SO4-/SnO2 catalysts, respectively. It can be seen in these tables that on the most active sulfated zirconia and titania samples, and independently of the preparation conditions used, light isoparaffins (Cs-C7) formed by cracking of heavier products are the predominant compounds formed in the initial reaction Table 4 Initial (1 min TOS) product distribution obtained on the SO4 /ZrO2 catalysts as a function of method of preparation and calcination temperature Preparation I S-Zr 6AS-Zr 9AS-Zr 500 550 600 650 500 550 600 500 550 600 2-C4 = cony.

This implies that while these catalysts are highly active for converting n-butene, they result in a low concentration of the desired TMP in the final product. On the contrary, TMP are the major products on the less active catalysts of these sulfated metal oxides, owing to their lower activity for cracking C8 and C9+ compounds. For instance, TMP amount for ca. 70 wt.-% of the Cs+ product obtained with the 6AS-Zr(500) catalyst. Results in Table 6 clearly show that SO4z-/SnO2 catalysts produce a significant lower amount of cracking products, even on the most active samples, when compared to the other two sulfated metal oxides at similar conversion levels. Moreover, it can be seen that, in general, at similar conversions Table 6 Initial (1 min TOS) product distribution obtained on the SO~-/SnO2 catalysts as a function of method of preparation and calcination temperature Preparation 1S-Sn 6AS-Sn 9AS-Sn 500 550 600 500 550 600 500 550 600 2-C4 = cony.(%) 47 73 65 55 60 C5+ dist.(wt.-%) C5-C7 5 23 15 14 19 TMP 13 45 37 40 43 DMH 8 11 11 12 8 Octenes 47 11 15 9 15 C9+ 27 10 22 25 15 TMPs dist.(%) 2,2,4- 20 48 43 43 41 2,2,3- 7 8 10 13 10 2,3,4- 47 23 25 22 27 2,3,3- 26 21 22 22 22 0 76 52 44 18 12 8 48 33 34 11 10 13 7 33 26 16 12 19 42 27 28 12 7 7 23 41 39 23 25 26 A. Corma et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 249-268 259 SO42-/SnO2 catalysts give a higher proportion of octenes and C9+ than sulfated zirconia and titania samples. Taking into account that the acid strength required to perform the different processes occurring during isobutane/butene alkylation decreases in the order: cracking > alkylation > olefin dimerization (oligomeriza- tion), these results strongly suggest that the acid sites in SO4-/SnO2 are of a lower acid strength than those present in sulfated zirconia and sulfated titania. The very high cracking activity observed on the most active samples of the latter two sulfated oxides suggest that very strong acid sites are formed at the optimum calcination conditions. Besides the possible influence of the nature of the metal cation discussed above, results in Tables 4-6 also show that, for a given metal oxide, the sulfate source and sulfate concentration have an influence on the initial product distribution. For instance, sample 6AS-Zr(550) gives a much higher concentra- tion of cracking products than samples 1S-Zr(500) and 1S-Zr(650), whereas the butene conversion is almost the same for these three sulfated zirconia samples. Moreover, sample 9AS-Zr(500), which was seen by XRD to be mostly amor- phous, gives a much higher amount of dimerization products (DMH and octenes) than sample 6AS-Zr(500) at similar conversions, indicating a lower acid strength of the acid sites in the former catalyst. In the case of sulfated titania catalysts, samples prepared from 0.5 M sulfuric acid and ammonium sulfate with the 6 wt.-% SO4z- solution are more active for cracking than the catalysts prepared from ammonium sulfate with 9 wt.-% SO4- and therefore, the former samples should have acid sites of higher acid strength. The very low activity obtained with the 1S-Ti(650) and 9AS-Ti(600) samples of sulfated titania, as well as the lack of activity observed for the 6AS-Sn(600) preparation of sulfated stannium oxide should be noticed. In the case of the I S-Ti(650) sample, the very low activity may be related with its very low sulfur content (0.1%) and low surface area (35 m2/g) after calcination at 650 (Table 2). Impregnation of titanium hydroxide with 0.5 M H2SO4 was seen to produce low thermally stable sulfates as compared to impregnation with (NH4)2SO4. However, samples 9AS-Ti(600) and 6AS-Sn(600) have sulfur contents and surface areas comparable to other active preparations (Tables 2 and 3), and consequently, this cannot be the reason for the observed inactivity for isobutane alkylation. Lee et al. [42] showed by means of temperature-programmed desorption/re- action (TPDR) and IR spectroscopy that 1-butene adsorbed on SO42-/Fe203 reacted with the surface sulfates promoting their decomposition, even at ambient temperature. Other authors [33,43] also observed a certain loss of sulfur species in sulfated zirconia samples during the n-butane isomerization reaction, but in this case the decomposition of sulfates was much less pronounced and occurred at temperatures above 250. Then, the chemical stability of the sulfates during a given chemical reaction on sulfated promoted oxides, and especially when olefins are involved in the process (as is the case of isobutane/butene alkyla- 260 Table 7 Sulfur and A.

In this way, we measured the sulfur and carbon contents of the spent catalysts after 20 rain on stream, and the results are given in Tables 7-9. It can be seen there that the sulfur content remaining in samples 9AS-Ti(600) and 6AS-Sn(600) after reaction is very low (0.1 and 0.2 wt.-%, respectively). The almost complete loss of sulfate species in these samples during the reaction could thus explain the lack of activity observed for isobu- tane/butene alkylation. According to Lee et al. [42] it may be speculated that this loss of sulfur is due to chemical interaction of the butene feed with the sulfates promoting their decomposition under the reaction conditions. Compar- ing the sulfur content of the spent catalysts (Tables 7-9) with that of the 'fresh' samples (Tables 1-3) it can be observed that some sulfate degradation also occurs for the other sulfated oxide preparations, but in a much lower extent. In general, the loss of sulfur during the reaction is lower for the most active catalysts. However, the exact mechanism by which sulfate species decompose during the reaction, and the reason for which in some cases this leads to almost Table 8 Sulfur and carbon contents in the spent SO2-/TiO2 catalysts after 20 min TOS Sample wt.-% Sulfur wt.-% Carbon 1S-Ti(500) 1.0 3.1 1S-Ti(550) 1. l 2.1 1S-Ti(600) 0.6 0.6 1S-Ti(650) 0 0.2 6AS-Ti(450) 1.6 4.0 6AS-Ti(500) 1.6 3.9 6AS-Ti(550) 1.1 2.5 6AS-Ti(600) 0.8 2.2 9AS-Ti(500) 1.3 3.0 9AS-Ti(550) 1.3 2.7 9AS-Ti(600) 0.1 0.4 A.

Nevertheless, it may be concluded that the chemical stability of the sulfate species in sulfate promoted metal oxides during isobutane/butene alkylation may play an important role in the activity and stability of the catalysts. Results of Tables 7-9 also show that the carbon content in the spent catalysts decreases, for a given metal oxide and a given method of preparation, when increasing the calcination temperature, that is, when decreasing the sulfur content in the 'fresh' samples. No correlation is found between the amount of carbon deposited in the catalyst and the initial alkylation activity, and neither with the deactivation rate of the catalysts, as it will be seen later. However, it can be clearly seen that, in general, SO42-/SnO2 samples produce a higher 100 80 \"~ 60 u 40 ~ 20 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 TOS (min) Fig. 4.

This could be in agreement with the higher dimerization-oligomerization activity of the former catalysts, as is already discussed. 3.2.2. Evolution with time on stream (TOS) Under the reaction conditions used all the sulfated oxides undergo a rapid deactivation with time. In most of the cases, and despite the strong differences in activity observed at 1 rain TOS, the 2-butene conversion reaches a stable level in the 20-40 wt.-% conversion range after 5-10 min TOS.

Corma et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 249-268 263 SO4-/ZrO2 catalysts, the 2-butene conversion in the steady state period is very similar (about 20 wt.-% conversion) for the samples prepared from ammonium sulfate, independently of the SOJ concentration and calcination temperature. On the contrary, the activation temperature has a much higher influence in the sulfated zirconia prepared from sulfuric acid, and the sample calcined at 550, 1S-Zr(550), gives the highest olefin conversion (ca. 40 wt.-%) in the steady state. A similar situation is found for the SO42-/SnO2 catalysts. There are not significant differences in the steady conversion (ca. 20 wt.-%) between the samples prepared from ammonium sulfate and calcined at different tempera- tures, whereas the sulfuric acid preparation gives rise to higher differences when varying the activation temperature. In this case, the 1S-Sn(600) catalyst (pre- pared from sulfuric acid and calcined at 600) is the most stable among the 100 ( a) 80~ + 60 .~ 40 ~J4 20 0 ~~ 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 TOS (min) 100~ 80 60 .=. 40 20 ~J b) TOS (min) Fig. 7.

However, the higher differences in steady activity of sulfated titania catalysts are found for the samples obtained by impregnation with ammonium sulfate, although in all cases the conversion is maintained below 40 wt.-% in the stationary state. For the sake of clarity, the evolution of 2-butene conversion with TOS for the most represen- tative sample of each preparation of the three sulfated oxides is given in Figs. 4-6. The evolution of the different reaction products with TOS shows similar general features for all the sulfated metal oxides, irrespective of the method by which the sulfate was incorporated and irrespective of the calcination tempera- ture. In all cases, the evolution is characterized by a strong decrease in the C5-C7 products formed by cracking, and an increase of the C8 products as the 1I 80~ .4- 60 40 20 100 0 0 v 4 8 12 16 20 TOS (min) a) b) 24 8O 60 .=. 40 211 0 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 TOS (rain) Fig. 8.

These general trends are common for other solid acids, such as zeolites [37] and heteropolyacids [44], during isobutane alkylation, and are ascribed to a faster poisoning of the very strong acid sites responsible for cracking reactions. Thus, after a few minutes on stream under the reaction conditions used here, C ss become the predominant compounds in the reaction product. However, the composition of this fraction also experiences a dramatic change with catalyst ageing. The primary alkylation products, TMP, which are predominant at the beginning of the reaction, rapidly decrease with TOS at the expense of isooctenes, mainly dimethylhexenes, which become the main products during the period of low activity, whereas DMH remain at the initial levels or slightly decrease at higher TOS.

These trends can be observed in Figs. 7-9 for one representative sample of each sulfated metal oxide. Nevertheless, and despite the common features described above, some differ- ences between the three sulfated metal oxides can be appreciated from these figures. The SO42-/SNO2 sample shows the highest concentration of C8 in the C5+ product, and also the higher proportion of octenes in C8, in the period of steady activity. Moreover, there are also clear differences in the time at which the strong decrease of the primary TMP occurs, that is, the period in which the true alkylation is the predominant process. Thus, this period is the highest for the sulfated ZrO2 sample, then for the sulfated TiO2, and finally for the sulfated SnO2 catalyst. This would indicate that the concentration of active sites respon- sible for isobutane/butene alkylation decreases in the order: SO42-/ZrO2 > S042-/Ti02 > S04-/SnO2. 4. Conclusions The initial activity, product selectivity, and deactivation rate of sulfated ZrO2, TiO2 and SnO2 catalysts during isobutane/2-butene alkylation has been shown to strongly depend on the activation temperature of the sulfated amorphous hydroxides. Moreover, for a given sulfated metal oxide, the optimum calcination temperature giving maximum activity was seen to depend on the source of sulfur (sulfuric acid or ammonium sulfate) and sulfur concentration. Furthermore, the optimum calcination temperature also depends, for a given method of prepara- tion and sulfate concentration, on the nature of the metal cation (Zr, Ti, Sn). The initial activity, given by the initial 2-butene conversion, of sulfated oxides calcined at the optimum conditions decreases in the order: SO42-/ZrO2 > SO2-/TiO2 > SO2-/SNO2, which is the same trend reported for acidic strength measured by Hammett indicators. Owing to the presence of very strong acid sites, the most active sulfated zirconia and sulfated titania samples produce, at the usual alkylation temperatures, a very high initial concentration of cracking products, C5-C7, thus decreasing the concentration of the desired trimethylpen- tanes (TMP). On the contrary, SO42-/SnOz catalysts produce a lower amount of cracking products, but give a higher concentration of octenes and heavier C9+ compounds than SO2-/ZrO2 and SO42-/TiO2, indicating a higher activity for olefin dimerization/oligomerization on the weaker acid sites of the former catalysts. Under the reaction conditions used, all the samples suffer a rapid deactivation with time on stream (TOS). However, the deactivation rate also depended, for each sulfated metal oxide, on the preparation conditions and calcination temper- A. Corma et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 249-268 267 ature. In all cases, the concentration of cracked compounds rapidly decreases with TOS, indicating a faster poisoning of the stronger acid sites, while the C5 + product becomes richer in octenes formed by dimerization of the olefin on the remaining weaker acid sites. By measuring the sulfur content in the spent catalysts it has been observed that some sulfate decomposition takes place during the alkylation reaction on the three sulfated metal oxides. This is suggested to occur by chemical interaction of the butene feed with surface sulfates, thus promoting their decomposition from the very early reaction stages. For some sulfated oxide samples, i.e., 9AS-Ti(600) and 6AS-Sn(600), the sulfur lost during the reaction was ca. 90 wt.-% of the initial sulfur, and this caused the complete loss of catalytic activity. Then, it can be concluded that the chemical stability of sulfates during a given chemical reaction, and especially when olefins are involved in the process as is the case of isobutane/butene alkylation, has to be considered in order to explain the activity and deactivation of sulfate-promoted metal oxides.

All rights reserved The effect of sulfation conditions and activation temperature of sulfate-doped ZrO2, TiO2 and SnO2 catalysts during isobutane/2-butene alkylation A. Corma * A. Martínez C.

Tel.: (+34-6) 3877800; fax: (+34-6) 3877809. The activity, selectivity, and deactivation behavior of sulfated ZrO2, TiO2 and SnO2 catalysts during the liquid phase alkylation of isobutane with 2-butene at 32°C have been studied as a function of the sulfate source, i.e., sulfuric acid and ammonium sulfate, sulfate concentration, and calcination temperature. It has been shown that, for each metal oxide, the optimum calcination temperature giving maximum activity depends on both the source of sulfur and the sulfur concentration used during the impregnation step. Moreover, when the most active preparations of each sulfated oxide are compared, it is shown that the initial activity decreases in the order: SO4 2−/ZrO2⩾ SO4 2−/TiO2SO4 2−/SnO2, which is the expected trend of acid strength. However, owing to the higher strength of the acid sites, the former two catalysts present a very high initial cracking activity, thus affording low selectivities to the desired trimethylpentanes (TMP). It has also been shown that a certain loss of sulfates (between 0 and 30% of the initial sulfates for most of the preparations) takes place during the alkylation reaction on the three sulfated metal oxides. Sulfate decomposition is suggested to occur by chemical interaction of the butene molecules present in the feed with some surface sulfates.
