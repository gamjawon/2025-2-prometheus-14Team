DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60274-4 Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Ethyl Pyruvate on Chirally Modified Pt Catalysts Supported on Al 2 O 3 @FDU-14 Mesoporous Composites WANG Haihong, WANG Hongna, LI Xiaohong*, WANG Yimeng, WU Peng Shanghai Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry and Chemical Processes, Department of Chemistry, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200062, China Abstract: A series of Al 2 O 3 @FDU-14 composites with different alumina loadings were prepared using a solid state grinding method. The 4% Pt catalysts supported on Al 2 O 3 @FDU-14 were prepared by impregnation using H 2 PtCl 6 . X-ray diffraction, transmission electron mi- croscopy, and nitrogen adsorption characterization of the Pt/Al 2 O 3 @FDU-14 catalysts indicated that the mesoporous features of the FDU-14 mesopolymer were retained. The Pt/Al 2 O 3 @FDU-14 catalysts were used in the asymmetric hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate after they were chirally modified with cinchonidine. For Al 2 O 3 loading from 5% to 15%, Al 2 O 3 was uniformly dispersed inside the mesoporous channels of FDU-14 host. Ethyl pyruvate conversion and their ee values increased with increasing alumina loading, with a highest ee value of 80%. It was suggested that the alumina coating inside the mesoporous channels of FDU-14 decreased the surface electronic density of the FDU-14 mesopolymer so that cinchonidine can be easily adsorbed on the surface of Pt/Al 2 O 3 @FDU-14 catalysts. As compared with chirally modified Pt/FDU-14 catalysts, chirally modified Pt/Al 2 O 3 @FDU-14 catalysts gave higher ee values. Key words: platinum; cinchonidine; ethyl pyruvate; asymmetric hydrogenation; periodic mesoporous resol; mesoporous alumina com- posite Heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis is one of the most promising methods for the industrial preparation of chiral drugs because of its high optical yield, easy industrialization, and other advantages. Chiral compounds are used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, perfumes, food additivies, and other functional materials. Among the methods for the synthesis of chiral compounds, the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral compounds is popular. Chiral modifiers, such as tartaric acid and cinchona alkaloids, are used to modify noble metal catalysts such as Ni, Pt, and Pd to give some typical successful examples of heterogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation systems [1]. Cinchona alkaloid modified platinum for the asymmetric hydrogenation of Ä®-functionalized prochiral carbonyl compounds is an important milestone of this field. It can be used for the synthesis of many high value-added fine chemicals, and many researchers have worked on it [1â€“26]. Traditional inorganic materials such as Al 2 O 3 [1,2,4,5,7â€“9,11â€“14,25], SiO 2 [16,17], and Al 2 O 3 @SiO 2 [18,19] were originally used to support the Pt nanoparticles. Recently, organic polymers [20,21], carbon nanotubes [22,23], and mesoporous carbon materials [24] have been investigated as the support for the entrapment of Pt nanoparticles. The commercial Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is recognized as a standard catalyst in this area owing to its excellent catalytic property [7]. FDU-14 periodic mesoporous resols with the Ia3d symmetry was first reported by Zhang et al. [27,28]. It is synthesized from the organic-organic self-assembly of triblock copolymers with resols (phenol and formaldehyde) via a simple dilute aqueous strategy under basic conditions. Because the framework is composed of phenolic resins, it has strong hydrophobicity and good stability even under acidic and basic conditions, a high affinity for the substrates, and a high surface electronic density. In addition to their features of a mesoporous material, such as a large surface area and uniform mesopores, FDU-type WANG Haihong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1677â€“1684 mesoporous resols also contain a number of organic functional groups that have different characteristics from the traditional inorganic materials. In our previous work, we found that Pt nanoparticles entrapped in the FDU-15 periodic mesopolymer by a simple impregnation method were active in the catalysis of the asymmetric hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate after they were chirally modified with cinchonidine, and they showed moderate enantioselectivity. In addition, the Pt/FDU-15 catalyst could be reused in acetic acid for over 20 times without any loss of activity or enantioselectivity. This is because the benzene rings of the mesoporous FDU-15 resols can stabilize the Pt nanoparticles through a ÊŒ donation interaction [21]. In this work, a series of Al 2 O 3 @FDU-14 composites with different loadings of alumina were prepared using a solid-state grinding method to take advantage of both the FDU-14 periodic mesoporous resols and Al 2 O 3 . This composite as the support for Pt nanoparticles in the heterogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate has been rarely reported. The Pt/Al 2 O 3 @FDU-14 catalysts were expected to give a better higher catalytic performance than the Pt/FDU-14 catalyst in the asymmetric hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate after chiral modification with cinchonidine. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization The FDU-14 periodic mesoporous resols were synthesized using a procedure in the literature [27,28]. A series of Al 2 O 3 @FDU-14 composites with different alumina loadings (denoted as xAF, where x represents the alumina mass loading) were prepared using a solid-state grinding method [29]. The FDU-14 powder and Al(NO 3 ) 3 Â·9H 2 O were then mixed and ground in an agate mortar, followed by calcination under vacuum at 350 Â°C for 3 h, and finally the Al 2 O 3 @FDU-14 composites were prepared. The Pt/xAF catalysts were prepared by an impregnation method [19]. The Al 2 O 3 @FDU-14 composites were impregnated with H 2 PtCl 6 (Pt wt% Â• 37%) dissolved in ethanol or in a 1:1 V/V mixture of water and ethanol, and stirred for 4â€“6 h. Then the mixture was evaporated to remove excess solvent, which was followed by drying at 80â€“120 Â°C overnight. Subsequently, the catalyst precursor was reduced in an aqueous solution of sodium formate at 90 Â°C to obtain the 4 wt% Pt/xAF catalyst. To distinguish the different medium used for the Pt precursor, the 4 wt% Pt/xAF catalysts were designated as Pt/xAF-E or Pt/xAF-W+E, where E or W+E stands for the ethanol solution of H 2 PtCl 6 or the 1:1 V/V mixture solution of water and ethanol containing H 2 PtCl 6 . The Pt/xAF ctalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer, Cu K Ä® radiation), N 2 adsorption (Quantachrome Autosorb-3B system), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Jeol JEM-2100 electromicroscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV). 1.2 Asymmetric hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate 4 wt% Pt/xAF catalyst (0.1 g) was pretreated in a hydrogen flow at 300 Â°C for 2 h before use. The catalyst was then mixed with 20 ml acetic acid, 10 mg cinchonidine (99%, purchased from TCI) and 2 ml ethyl pyruvate (98%, purchased from Alfa Aesar). The mixture was transferred to a 100 ml autoclave. The hydrogenation reaction was performed with magnetic stirring (1000â€“1200 r/min) at room temperature and it began when 4.0 MPa of hydrogen was introduced. The reaction was stopped after 30 min and the products were analyzed by GC-FID (GC-2014, Shimadzu Co.) equipped with a chiral capillary column (HP19091G-B213, 30 m Ã— 0.32 mm Ã— 0.25 Pm, Agilent Co.). The optical yield was expressed as the enantiomeric excess (ee) of (R)-(+)-ethyl lactate. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalyst characterization results Figure 1 shows the low-angle and wide-angle XRD patterns 12345 30 40 50 60 70 80 I n t e n s i t y 2T/( o ) (1) (2) (3) (4) (211) (220) (a) (2) (1) Al 2 O 3 Pt(220) I n t e n s i t y Pt(111) Pt(200) 2T /( o ) Al 2 O 3 (b) (3) (4) Fig. 1.

WANG Haihong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1677â€“1684 of the Pt/xAF-W+E catalysts. All the Pt/xAF-W+E catalysts gave diffraction peaks that were indexed as the (211) and (220) planes of the FDU-14 host. This demonstrated that all the Pt/xAF-W+E catalysts retained the similar three-dimensional cubic meso-structure as the FDU-14 host even after the support was soaked in H 2 PtCl 6 solution and sodium formate aqueous solution for several hours. This also implied that the Al 2 O 3 @FDU-14 mesoporous composites had good hydrothermal stability. The wide-angle XRD patterns showed weak diffraction peaks at 2È™ = 39.7 o , 46.2 o , and 67.3 o that were indexed as the Pt(111), Pt (200), and Pt (220) planes, respectively. In the diffraction patterns of the Pt/5AF-W+E and Pt/10AF-W+E catalysts, we did not observe the diffraction peaks of the Al 2 O 3 crystalline phase, indicating that the Al 2 O 3 in 5AF and 10AF was uniformly dispersed inside the FDU-14 mesoporous channels without the formation of an Al 2 O 3 crystalline phase. When the Al 2 O 3 loading reached 15 wt%, weak diffraction peaks of the Al 2 O 3 crystalline phase could be observed at 2È™ = 37 o and 49 o , suggesting that Al 2 O 3 had began to aggregate at this loading. Figure 2 shows the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions of FDU-14 and xAF mesoporous composites. These samples exhibited typical Type IV isotherms and showed clear H1-type hysteresis loops in the p/p 0 = 0.4â€“0.6 region, indicating that the samples had a uniform mesoporous structure. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of FDU-14 and xAF samples in the low pressure region were not completely closed, which is consistent with the mesopolymer materials reported in the literature [27,28]. The pore structure parameters of the samples are shown in Table 1. With the increasing of the Al 2 O 3 loading, the BET surface area of the xAF composite materials decreased. The pore diameters of 5AF and 10AF were 3.6 nm, which was slightly larger than that of FDU-14 (3.4 nm). The introduction of Al 2 O 3 into the FDU-14 mesopores can inhibit FDU-14 framework shrinkage when it was calcined at a high temperature to remove the template agent, thus the 2È™ diffraction angle of the (211) crystal plane for 5AF and 10 AF was slightly smaller, and the corresponding d value was slightly larger than that of FDU-14. With the further increase of the Al 2 O 3 loading, the alumina amount exceeded the dispersion threshold of FDU-14, thus the Al 2 O 3 crystalline phase was gradually formed inside and outside the FDU-14 mesopores, which reduced the pore volume of the FDU-14 resols and the pore diameter of 15AF and 25AF decreased to 3.3 nm. When the Al 2 O 3 loading was increased to 35%, the hysteresis loop in the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms disappeared, demonstrating that the mesopores of FDU-14 had been blocked by the excessive Al 2 O 3 , and the BET surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter of 35AF were much decreased. Figure 3 shows the TEM images of some Pt/xAF-W+E catalysts. When the alumina loading was relatively low (Pt/5AF-W+E and Pt/10AF-W+E catalysts), the features of the three-dimensional mesoporous structure were quite distinct and the Pt nanoparticles were highly dispersed with the average Pt particle size of 3â€“4 nm. No alumina crystallite was observed, indicating that the alumina was uniformly and highly dispersed inside the mesopores of FDU-14 resols. When the alumina content reached 15%, needle-like alumina crystallites appeared that occupied part of the FDU-14 mesopores. This is consistent with the XRD and nitrogen adsorption characterization of the xAF composites.

The Pt/FDU-14-W+E catalyst gave 100% conversion of ethly pyruvate and 62% ee of (R)-(+)-ethyl lactate after it was chirally modified with cinchonidine. The coating of alumina inside the FDU-14 mesopores improved the chiral activity of the chirally modified Pt/xAF catalysts. With the increase of the alumina loading from zero to 15%, the chiral activity of the chirally modified Pt/xAF catalysts was gradually enhanced. As a result, the cinchonidine modified Pt/15AF-W+E catalyst gave an 80% ee value for (R)-(+)-ethyl lactate. When the alumina loading was increased to 25%, the conversion and enantioselectivity both decreased to give only 82.9% conversion and 62.7% ee value. The catalytic performance of the chirally modified Pt/35AF-W+E catalyst was further decreased to give 12.1% conversion and 33% ee value. The chiral reaction of the cinchonidine modified Pt catalyst is through the ÊŒ donation of the quinoline ring or by adsorption through the N atom lone pair electrons of quinoline on the Pt surface [8]. The polyaromatic rings with a high electronic density in the FDU-14 resol framework will hinder the adsorption of cinchonidine on the Pt surface by a repulsion interaction. Therefore, the chiral activity of he Pt/FDU-14-W+E catalyst was relatively low. The introduction of alumina inside the FDU-14 mesopores will produce a highly dispersed film that block the ÊŒ electrons of FDU-14. Therefore, a strong interaction between the Pt nanoparticles and the highly dispersed alumina would benefit the adsorption of cinchonidine to result in high enantioselectivity. Although PtCl 6 2â€“ species can be uniformly dispersed on the xAF composties surface when the composites were impreganated with the mixture solution of H 2 PtCl 6 , after the alumina loading reached above 25 wt%, alumina crystallites formed will occupy and block the mesopores of xAF. Thus, the specific surface areas of these xAF composites were strongly decreased (see the relevant paramters in Table 1). Therefore, the mass transport of reactant and product will be slow in the asymmetric hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate catalyzed by Fig. 3.

In order to investigate the effect of the dispersion medium on the reaction results, we also changed the medium used to dis- solve H 2 PtCl 6 . Compared with the Pt/xAF-W+E catalysts, the Pt/xAF-E catalysts with the same alumina loading prepared using the ethanol solution of H 2 PtCl 6 showed slightly higher activities for the asymmetric hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate. The chirally modified Pt/35AF-E catalyst gave 79.5% conver- sion and 66.5% ee value. The PtCl 6 2â€“ species were mostly dispersed on the outer surface of the xAF composites when the xAF composites were impregnated with the ethanol solution of H 2 PtCl 6 due to the strong hydrophobicity of the xAF compos- ites [19]. It appeared that the reactant could still be adsorbed and hydrogenated on the surface of Pt nanoparticles dispersed on the outer surface of xAF composites to give fairly high activity and enantioselectivity, even when alumina crystallites in 25AF and 35AF had already occupied the mesopores of the FDU-14 resols. 3 Conclusions Al 2 O 3 @FDU-14 mesoporous composites were prepared by coating alumina inside the mesopores of FDU-14 resols using a solid-state grinding method. The composites had the structural features of a periodic mesoporous material such as ordered mesopores, high surface area, and tunable pore size, and also had the high catalytic activity of alumina. The introduction of alumina inside the mesopores of FDU-14 resols decreased the electronic density of the walls of the FDU-14 resols so that the chiral modifier was easily adsorbed on the catalyst surface. Thus, the chiral reaction activity of the chirally modified Pt catalyst supported on the composites was improved. The solid-state grinding method can also be used to prepare other solid composites.

Adv Mater, 2005, 17: 323 rder to investigate the effect of the dispersion medium on the reaction results, we also changed the medium used to dis- solve H 2 PtCl 6 . Compared with the Pt/xAF-W+E catalysts, the Pt/xAF-E catalysts with the same alumina loading prepared using the ethanol solution of H 2 PtCl 6 showed slightly higher activities for the asymmetric hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate. The chirally modified Pt/35AF-E catalyst gave 79.5% conver- sion and 66.5% ee value. The PtCl 6 2â€“ species were mostly dispersed on the outer surface of the xAF composites when the xAF composites were impregnated with the ethanol solution of H 2 PtCl 6 due to the strong hydrophobicity of the xAF compos- ites [19]. It appeared that the reactant could still be adsorbed and hydrogenated on the surface of Pt nanoparticles dispersed on the outer surface of xAF composites to give fairly high activity and enantioselectivity, even when alumina crystallites in 25AF and 35AF had already occupied the mesopores of the FDU-14 resols. 3 Conclusions Al 2 O 3 @FDU-14 mesoporous composites were prepared by coating alumina inside the mesopores of FDU-14 resols using a solid-state grinding method. The composites had the structural features of a periodic mesoporous material such as ordered mesopores, high surface area, and tunable pore size, and also had the high catalytic activity of alumina. The introduction of alumina inside the mesopores of FDU-14 resols decreased the electronic density of the walls of the FDU-14 resols so that the chiral modifier was easily adsorbed on the catalyst surface. Thus, the chiral reaction activity of the chirally modified Pt catalyst supported on the composites was improved. The solid-state grinding method can also be used to prepare other solid composites. The composite-supported Pt catalysts after modification with a chiral modifier are expected to show high enantioselectivity in water. References 1 Mallat T, Orglmeister E, Baiker A.

Tel/Fax: +86-21-62238590 A series of Al2O3@FDU-14 composites with different alumina loadings were prepared using a solid state grinding method. The 4% Pt catalysts supported on Al2O3@FDU-14 were prepared by impregnation using H2PtCl6. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and nitrogen adsorption characterization of the Pt/Al2O3@FDU-14 catalysts indicated that the mesoporous features of the FDU-14 mesopolymer were retained. The Pt/Al2O3@FDU-14 catalysts were used in the asymmetric hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate after they were chirally modified with cinchonidine. For Al2O3 loading from 5% to 15%, Al2O3 was uniformly dispersed inside the mesoporous channels of FDU-14 host. Ethyl pyruvate conversion and their ee values increased with increasing alumina loading, with a highest ee value of 80%. It was suggested that the alumina coating inside the mesoporous channels of FDU-14 decreased the surface electronic density of the FDU-14 mesopolymer so that cinchonidine can be easily adsorbed on the surface of Pt/Al2O3@FDU-14 catalysts. As compared with chirally modified Pt/FDU-14 catalysts, chirally modified Pt/Al2O3@FDU-14 catalysts gave higher ee values. 摘要 以碳包铁纳米晶 (Fe@C) 为载体, 采用浸渍法制备了一种磁可分离的 Pd/Fe@C 催化剂, 并运用 X 射线荧光光谱、透射电镜、X 射线衍射和 X 射线光电子能谱对催化剂进行了表征. 结果表明, 纳米 Pd 颗粒的粒径分布在 4∼10 nm, 平均粒径约为 7 nm, Pd 物种以 Pd0 为主, 其 Pd 3d 5/2 结合能为 335.6 eV. 将该催化剂应用于苯甲醇选择性氧化反应, 考察了催化剂用量、溶剂、温度对反应的影响以及催化剂的循环使用性能. 结果表明, 催化剂可使苯甲醇高选择性生成苯甲醛, 在催化剂用量 (摩尔分数) 为 0.5%、乙腈为溶剂、80 oC 常压 O2 条件下, 苯甲醇的氧化反应效果最佳 (苯甲醇转化率为 96%, 苯甲醛选择性为 95%). 催化剂易于磁分离和回收, 循环使用 4 次仍保持较佳的催化性能.
