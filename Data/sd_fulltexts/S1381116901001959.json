Tel.: +49-228-732-261; fax: +49-228-739-424 It is known that some colloidal catalysts show “homogeneous”-like behavior, but it is unclear which parameters define the borderline between heterogeneous, i.e. surface reactions, and homogeneous-type catalysis of colloidal systems. The reaction of ethynylbenzene (phenylacetylene) with parahydrogen using the colloidal palladium catalyst Pd x [(N(octyl)4Cl] y leads to nuclear spin polarization in the hydrogenation products. Accordingly, the in situ NMR method parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) is an appropriate tool to investigate hydrogenation mediated by colloidal catalysts. Keywords PHIP Colloid Catalysis Hydrogenation Parahydrogen Ethynylbenzene Styrene 1 Introduction Parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) [1–4] is a well known in situ NMR method, which has been used extensively [5,6] as an effective tool for the investigation of homogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation. Using parahydrogen (p-H2), in situ recorded 1 H NMR spectra show spin polarization due to the breakdown of the high symmetry of the p-H2 molecule. These characteristic PHIP patterns are observed only if the transfer of the two parahydrogen atoms occurs in a pair-wise manner, i.e. simultaneously, whereby the transferred protons have to experience some sort of mutual magnetic coupling at any time. The spin polarization of the hydrogenated molecules leads to signal enhancements of up to 104 [1,2]. Therefore, it is not only possible to detect final hydrogenation products at very low concentrations, but also catalytic intermediates like transition metal dihydrides or catalyst–substrate complexes can be observed. The polarization patterns reveal information about the mechanism and the kinetics of the reaction and the structure and the mode of formation of the polarized products. Heterogeneous catalysts are not expected to give rise to the PHIP effect, since the spin correlation in the adsorbed p-H2 is considered to be lost once the dihydrogen molecules interact with a catalytically active surface. Therefore, the most likely hydrogen atoms transferred in such a fashion would stem from different p-H2 molecules. However, we have shown that the colloidal transition metal catalyst used gives rise to the PHIP phenomenon, thereby implying a homogeneous reaction pathway and proving that the two transferred hydrogen atoms stem from the same dihydrogen molecule. 2 Experimental Five millimeter NMR tubes were charged with 100μl ethynylbenzene, 6mg of the catalyst Pd x [(N(octyl)4Cl] y , and 0.7ml of acetone-d6 and placed into a 200MHz spectrometer. Fifty percent-enriched p-H2 was prepared via catalytic equilibration over charcoal at 77K [5] and injected repeatedly in synchronization with the pulsed NMR experiment via an electromechanically lowered glass capillary mechanism. Higher levels of p-H2 enrichment, namely >97% have also been achieved using a closed cycle cooler cryostat [7]. Fig. 1 shows PHIP-NMR spectra obtained during the hydrogenation of ethynylbenzene with p-H2. In order to eliminate interfering signals originating from spins in thermal equilibrium, i.e. ‘non-PHIP signals’, the NMR spectra were acquired after a hydrogenation time of 10s accumulating the responses to different pulse angles [8]. The maximum signal intensity for PHIP signals occurs at a flip angle of 45°, in contrast to the usual “90° pulse” used for substrates in thermal equilibrium. Therefore, by alternately adding and subtracting scans acquired using pulse angles of −45° and 135°, respectively, it is possible to minimize or even suppress the signal intensity of the unpolarized, the so-called ‘thermal’ proton spins, whereas the signals of the proton spins in polarization then display the maximum of their signal intensity [8]. Less than perfect elimination of the thermal signals may occur, nevertheless, in part because of a slight drift of the external magnetic field (B 0), or because of changes of the homogeneity. Each spectrum shown in Fig. 1 is the result of four accumulated scans and 40s of hydrogenation time each. 3 Results and discussion Hydrogenation of ethynylbenzene to the Z-product leads to polarization signals in the respective positions H1 and H2 of styrene, as is detected. Furthermore, polarization also occurs in position H3. This signal shows an anti-phase coupling of 1Hz with its geminal hydrogen. Whether this is a result of geminal transfer of p-H2 parahydrogen to the positions H2 and H3, or the consequence of a nuclear Overhauser effect, will soon be discriminated using deuterated ethynylbenzene. With proceeding hydrogenation the concentration of ethynylbenzene decreases; therefore, the positions H1 and H2 show less and less polarization. Subsequently, the polarization signals H4 and H5 of ethylbenzene, the hydrogenation product of styrene, appear. Accordingly, ethylbenzene is formed via homogeneous catalysis as well, i.e. two more p-H2 protons are transferred simultaneously. 4 Conclusions The hydrogenation of ethynylbenzene to styrene as well as that of styrene to ethylbenzene mediated by the colloidal catalyst Pd x [(N(octyl)4Cl] y occurs in a “pair-wise” fashion, i.e. the two hydrogen atoms of dihydrogen are transferred simultaneously, which is characteristic of a homogeneous hydrogenation. This in situ NMR experiment convincingly demonstrates the unique power of PHIP for the investigation of hydrogenation mediated by colloidal systems. Additional in situ NMR experiments will be conducted to investigate if more features of homogeneous catalysts apply to colloidal systems as well. References [1] C.R. Bowers D.P. Weitekamp Phys. Rev.
