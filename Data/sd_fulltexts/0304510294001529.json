Using Pb(OAc)2 - Pb(OH) z as a catalyst, 97% of aniline present is converted into MPC with 95% selectivity at 453 K in I h. In the case of PbO catalyst, an induction period was observed and it disappeared when the catalyst was pretreated with dimethyl carbonate or methanol. The effects of the reaction variables are examined in the reaction using Pb(OAc)2 -Pb(OH)z as the catalyst and the reaction mechanism is discussed. Key words: aniline; lead; methoxycarbonylation; carbamate derivatives 1. Introduction Carbamates, of which methyl N-phenyl carbamate (MPC) is the simplest aromatic member, are widely used as intermediates in the synthesis of pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, and plastics. Moreover, they can be transformed into isocyanates by thermal cracking. There are various methods for synthesizing carbamates [ 1 ] . The most common method for preparing MPC with a high yield is the reaction of methanol with phenyl isocyanate, which is produced from aniline and phosgene [2].

All rights reserved SSDI0304-5102(94)00038-W 400 Z.-H. Fu, Y. Ono /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 9l (1994) 399-105 This method has the following drawbacks. The first drawback is the use of highly toxic phosgene. The second drawback is the stoichiometric formation of HCl as a by-product. Several methods for preparing carbamates without using phosgene have been reported: the oxidative carbonylation of aniline in the presence of alcohol catalyzed by transition metal complexes [ 3-9 ] , the carbonylation of organic azides catalyzed by RhCI (CO) (PPh2) 2 heterogenized on a polymeric phosphine [ 10,11 ] , and the reductive carbonylation of aromatic nitrocompounds with methanol [ 12-16] or a formate ester [ 17] and carbon monoxide in the presence of transition metal catalysts. The carbamates can also be synthesized from amines and alkyl carbonates such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC). PhNH2 + (CH3 O) z CO -') PhNHCOOCH3 + CH3 OH This method of synthesis has been little studied since DMC has long been synthesized from methanol and phosgene. Because a process for preparing DMC from CO, OZ, and methanol has been recently industrialized [ 18 ] , the use of alkyl carbonates is becoming an attractive route for the synthesis of carbamates without using dangerous and corrosive reagents. Porta et al. reported the reaction of diethyl carbonate with 1-propylamine gave the corresponding carbamates in the presence of metal compounds such as AIC13 [ 19] . They also reported that FeC13 and AIC13 were inactive when the reaction was carried out with aniline instead of 1-propylamine under the same reaction conditions. Lissel et al. reported that aniline can be methoxycarbonylated with dimethyl carbonate in the presence of K2C03 and 18crown-6 [20] . Several patents have been disclosed for the synthesis of carbamates from dialkyl carbonates and amines including aniline [ 21-25 ] . The various catalysts including Ti, Sn and Zn compounds are known to be active for the carbamate synthesis. In this paper, we will report that various lead compounds are highly effective catalysts for the synthesis of methyl N-phenyl carbamate from aniline and dimethyl carbonate. The effects of the reaction variables are examined and the reaction mechanism will be discussed. 2. Experimental Lead compounds such as Pb (OAc) 2 - Pb (OH) 2 were commercial products and used as received. Pb (OAc) Z was obtained by heating Pb (OAc) 2 . 3H20 at 303 K for 2 h under vacuum. The structure was confirmed by the X-ray powder diffraction pattern. The reactions were carried out as follows: aniline, DMC and a catalyst were charged into a 50 cm3 autoclave. Air in the autoclave was replaced by nitrogen. After cooling, the catalyst was separated by centrifuge. The analyses of the products Z.-H Fu, Y. Ono /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 399-405 401 were carried out by a gas-liquid chromatography (GC) with a flame-ionization detector (FID). The conversion and selectivity are expressed on the basis of aniline charged, if not otherwise mentioned. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Catalysis by various lead compounds The results of the reaction of aniline with DMC in the presence of lead compounds are shown in Table 1. The reactions were carried out at 433 K for 1 h. Without a catalyst, the reaction proceeded only slightly. The lead compounds studied showed very high activities together with high selectivities. For example, using red PbO as the catalyst, the aniline conversion of 98% with the MPC selectivity of 99% were obtained. The by-products were N-methylaniline and NN-dimethylaniline. The lead compounds, i.e., Pb(OAc)2 - Pb(OH)z are more active than zinc compounds, such as Zn (OAc) 2 - 2H20 and Zn (OAc) 2, which have already been reported as highly active catalysts [ 23,24 ] . 3.2. Reaction with Pb(OAc)2 - Pb(OH)2 as catalyst Fig. 1 shows the effect of the DMC/aniline ratio on the conversion and MPC yield in the reaction using Pb (OAc) 2 - Pb (OH) 2 as the catalyst.

Fig. 3 shows the effect of the reaction temperature on the MPC yield in the reaction with use of Pb (OAc) 2 - Ph (OH) 2 as the catalyst and at the DMC / aniline molar ratio of 2.0. MPC was not obtained at all at 403 K, and above 413 K, the MPC yield increased with the reaction temperature. It reached 92% at 453 K. Under these reaction conditions, the selectivity for MPC based on aniline was 94.8% and DMC conversion was 55%, the selectivity for MPC based on DMC being 84%. Z.-H. Fu, Y.

Reaction with Pb0 as catalyst In Fig. 3 is also shown the effect of the reaction temperature when the reaction was carried out for 1 h with use of orthorhombic (yellow) Pb0 as a catalyst at a DMC/aniline ratio of 5.4. A very peculiar phenomenon was observed: MPC was not obtained at all even at 428 K, but the MPC yield reached 95% (aniline conversion of 97%) at 433 K. The MPC yield increased sharply in the very narrow temperature range of 5 K. In Fig. 4 the change in the MPC yield with reaction time at 423 K using Pb0 (yellow) as a catalyst. MPC was not formed for the first 1 h. But the MPC yield suddenly reached 94% in a reaction time of 2 h. The presence of the induction period suggests that the catalyst Pb0 is transformed into the active form in the first stage of the reaction. 404 Z.-H. Fu, Y.

In order to determine the chemistry in the induction period, PbO was treated with 10 cm' of DMC for 1 h at 433 K. The solid thus obtained was separated and then used as the catalyst for the reaction of DMC and aniline. The time course of the MPC yield is also shown in Fig. 4. The induction time disappeared. In another experiment, PbO was treated with methanol for 1 h at 433 K, separated and used as the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 4, the induction time was eliminated. On the other hand, the pretreatment of PbO with aniline showed no effects. These results indicate that PbO is not a real catalyst, but merely a precursor of the catalytically active species. Upon pretreatment of PbO with DMC, no peak due to PbO was observed by XRD and the only species observed was 3Pb0 - HZO. It means that the reaction does not occur on the surface of PbO and that the bulk of the PbO is transformed into a new phase. Similarly, upon pretreatment with PbO, with methanol, the intensities of the diffraction peaks due to PbO decreased to 20% of the original one, and new phases due to Pb(OMe)2 and 3Pb0 - HZO were observed. 3.4. Reaction mechanism The disappearance of the induction period by treating PbO with DMC or methanol and the formation of 3Pb0 - H20 and Pb (OMe) z by the treatment indicate that the hydroxyl groups or methoxy groups attached to Ph ions may play a key role in the catalysis. This may also be supported by a high activity of Pb (OAc) 2 - Pb (OH) 2. We propose the reaction scheme shown in Scheme 1. The surface PbOH groups interact with dimethyl carbonate to form PbOCOOMegroups, which, in turn, react with aniline to form MPC and regenerate the surface PbOH groups. 4. Conclusion Lead compounds such as Pb (OAc) 2 ' Pb (OH) 2 catalyze the methoxycarbonylation of aniline with dimethyl carbonate to give methyl N-phenyl carbamate in Z.-H. Fu, Y. Ono/Journal ofMolecularCatalysts 91 (1994) 399fi05 405 high yields. In the presence of Pb (OAc) 2 - Pb (OH) 2 as a catalyst, a 92% yield of MPC was attained with a selectivity of 95% in 1 h at 453 K.

Valencia Ave., Brea, CA 92621, USA. The hydrodesulfurization of thiophene on a commercial CoMo/alumina catalyst was studied in a Berty type CSTR reactor at 350°C, with partial pressures of hydrogen sulfide in the range of 0.2 to 5.5 bar. A kinetic model with interconversion of active sites is superior to models based on a fixed number of active sites. The proposed mechanism for the interconversion of active sites predicts that the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis activities of a HDS catalyst can be substantially varied by hydrogen sulfide.
