The addition of the alkanes C2H6, C3H8, or n-C4H10 in the CH4–O2–SO2 reaction feed resulted in an improvement of pre-sulfated 1% Pt/γ-Al2O3 activity on CH4 oxidation in lean conditions. These results are explained assuming that (i) the energy generated during the oxidation of the alkanes may be transferred to activate the rate determining step of CH4 oxidation, over the catalyst surface, increasing the reaction rate at lower temperatures and (ii) alkanes oxidation may lower the coverage of oxygen on the Pt surface, leaving surface active sites free for CH4 adsorption, thus increasing its oxidation rate, since, oxygen species act as an inhibitor for the reaction at full coverage. n-C4H10 addition in the reaction feed generated the highest promotion on CH4 complete oxidation. This promotional effect was further increased on pre-sulfated 2% Pt/γ-Al2O3. Results presented in this investigation suggest that small amounts of n-butane in the gas feed during CH4–O2 reaction over a pre-sulfated Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst may eliminate completely very low concentrations of methane emissions at low temperatures from lean-burn NGV exhausts. Graphical abstract A very strong promotional effect of the presence of C2H6, C3H8, or n-C4H10 in the reaction feed on complete oxidation of low concentrations of methane (2000ppmV) under lean-burn conditions and in the presence of SO2 was found over sulfated 1% Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. This promotional effect was further increased on 2% Pt/γ-Al2O3. Results are explained on basis of the probability of methane adsorption on the free Pt surface active sites. This probability increases (i) as the oxygen coverage over platinum surface is lowered by C2H6, C3H8, or n-C4H10 oxidation and (ii) as the number of initial surface Pt sites increases. Keywords Methane oxidation NGVs emissions Sulfated Pt catalysts Sulfur deactivation resistance 1 Introduction Natural gas represents one promising alternative energy source for the future in automotive and heavy-duty vehicles. In comparison with traditional fuelled vehicles, lean-burn natural gas vehicles (NGV) generate a lower impact on environment, due to smokeless exhausts and reduced nitrogen oxide emissions due to the lower combustion temperatures associated with the high air to fuel mass ratios (20 or greater) at which the lean engine operates. Also tailpipe CO2 emissions in NGV light-duty vehicles can be lower than in conventional fuelled vehicles due to the higher hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of natural gas. Natural gas engines can operate under lean conditions so that the fuel efficiency can be increased compared to stoichiometric conditions. Under these conditions, unburned methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is emitted in the exhaust gases. Accordingly, severe limitations on CH4 emissions have been enforced [1]. In order to meet these severe regulations, a catalytic exhaust converter has to be installed on lean-burn heavy-duty NGVs. This device is designed to achieve methane emission abatement by catalytic combustion. However, difficulties arise due to the high stability of the CH4 molecule and from the reaction conditions specific to lean-burn engines. Typical exhaust gases are characterized by low temperatures (less than 500–550°C), low concentrations of CH4, large amounts of water vapor, large excess of oxygen and presence of SO2 and NO x . The complete oxidation of methane can be performed over either noble metals or transition metal oxides [2–5]. Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are widely recognized as the most active in combustion of methane [1,6–14], but are deactivated by water and sulfur containing compounds present in the exhaust. Platinum catalysts properties in the complete oxidation of methane at low temperature have been less studied. It has been shown that Pt has a very poor activity for methane oxidation, but would be more resistant to sulfur poisoning [6,10]. By adding small amounts of platinum into the palladium catalyst, relative improved activity was obtained in comparison with the monometallic palladium catalyst for complete oxidation of methane [15,16]. Now, in recent investigations, we found a strong promotional effect of the presence of 1000ppmV C3H8 in the reaction feed on CH4–SO2–O2 reaction over pre-sulfated Pt/γ-Al2O3 [17] and pre-sulfated Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 [18] catalysts. Moreover, the catalysts showed no deactivation due to the SO2 present in the gas feed. These results were obtained using a reaction feed containing a concentration of 2vol% CH4, which is higher relative to the concentration of methane in a real NGV exhaust (as low as 1000ppmV) [9,19]. This promotional effect of propane was explained in terms of (i) the propane combustion heat which may be transferred, to activate the abstraction, of the first hydrogen of the adsorbed methane molecule and (ii) to propane oxidation that may lower the high coverage of oxygen on the Pt surface, leaving surface active sites free for CH4 adsorption. In order to confirm these explanations, in this study, we investigated the effect of the presence of other alkanes with different combustion heats [20] and different number of carbon atoms. Therefore, we studied the effect of the presence of ethane, propane or n-butane on the activity of pre-sulfated Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts on CH4–O2–SO2 reaction using a reaction feed containing a low concentration of methane (2000ppmV) in excess oxygen and in the presence of SO2. 2 Experimental The support used was γ-Al2O3 Merck with a grain size of 0.063–0.200mm (70–230 mesh ASTM). Before use, the support was calcined for 6h at 600°C in air. Pt catalysts supported on alumina were prepared by impregnation using acidic aqueous solution (0.1M HCl) of H2PtCl6·6H2O (Merck, minimum 98% purity). After impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 120°C overnight, and then, calcined in flowing air for 6h at 500°C. Finally, the catalysts were reduced in pure hydrogen flow for 8h at 500°C. A reference alumina support was prepared in the same way using only diluted hydrochloric acid. A sample of the reduced catalyst was then sulfated. Sulfation was performed on samples heating to 500°C in flowing air (100cm3 min−1). The feed was then changed at 500°C for a nitrogen flow containing 50ppm SO2, 5% O2 (100cm3 min−1) for 10h. The sample was then cooled to 25°C. Platinum accessibility measurements on the reduced catalysts were obtained by the H2–O2 titration method at room temperature in a static volumetric apparatus and using the stoichiometric (H/Pt)surf =1. The chemical microanalysis of the catalyst was determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), (NORAN) performed in conjunction with a scanning electron microscope (JEOL, model JSM-6300). Catalysts metal contents are reported in Table 1 . Photoelectron spectra were recorded over pre-sulfated fresh sample using a VG Escalab 200R electron spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical analyzer, operating in a constant pass energy mode, and a non-monochromatic Mg Kα (hν =1253.6eV, 1eV=1.603×10−19 J) X-ray source operated at 10mA and 12kV. The energy regions of the photoelectrons of interest were scanned a number of times in order to get good signal-to-noise ratios. The intensities of the peaks were estimated by determining the integral of each peak after subtracting an S-shaped background and fitting the experimental peak to Lorentzian/Gaussian lines (80% L/20% G). The binding energies (BE) were referenced to the Al 2p peak, the BE of which was fixed at 74.5eV. Using this reference, BE values of C 1s peak coming from adventitious carbon appeared at 284.9±0.2eV. The catalysts tests were performed in a continuous flow tubular quartz reactor (inner diameter 7mm) placed in a programmable furnace. The catalyst temperature was controlled by a thermocouple mounted internally in direct contact with the sample in order to read the true catalyst temperature. Measurements over the catalysts were performed using a feed volume flow rate of 100cm3 min−1 consisting of 2000ppmV CH4, 20vol% of O2, 50ppmV SO2, without or with C2H6 or C3H8, or n-C4H10 (2000ppmV, 1333ppmV, 666ppmV, or 333ppmV) and balance N2. The catalyst loading was of 200mg. The reactor out flow was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC-17 Shimadzu) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. Two consecutive heating and cooling cycles at temperatures from 25 to 600°C were conducted; the results from the second cycle were used in this study. The conversions of CH4, C2H6, C3H8, or n-C4H10 to all products were calculated based on the following equation: conversion ( % ) = X in − X out X in × 100 X in is the concentration of X introduced in the experiment and X out is the concentration of X at the reactor outlet. 3 Results 3.1 Catalysts characterization The catalyst characterization data are summarized in Table 1. Pt dispersion values of 0.35 and 0.30 were obtained for unsulfated 1% Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 2% Pt/γ-Al2O3, respectively. Pt dispersion values for the catalysts after reaction or after sulfation were not determined because the samples needed to be reduced again under a H2 atmosphere at 100°C to reduce the Pt. This reduction might have led to the reduction of sulfate to H2S which poisons Pt sites. 3.2 Methane oxidation Pre-sulfated γ-Al2O3 was not active for methane oxidation at the temperatures studied in this work, in the presence and in the absence of C2H6, C3H8, or n-C4H10. Table 2 reports the temperatures at which 50% CH4 conversion (light-off50) for methane oxidation in CH4–O2–SO2 reaction are reached in the presence of different concentrations of the alkanes in the feed for pre-sulfated 1% Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The evolution of methane conversion in CH4–O2–SO2 reaction over pre-sulfated 1% Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in the presence and in the absence of 2000ppmV C2H6, C3H8, or n-C4H10 is shown in Fig. 1 . In this figure and in Table 2 it can be observed that the presence of C2H6, C3H8, or n-C4H10, results in a lowering of the CH4 light-off50 values on pre-sulfated 1% Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. This decrease is stronger as the alkane concentration in the feed increases and as the number of carbon atoms in the alkane molecule increases. In Table 2, CH4 light-off50 values obtained for methane oxidation in CH4–O2–SO2 reaction in the presence of 2000ppmV n-C4H10 are also reported for 2% Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. A further strong enhancement on CH4–O2 reaction resulted from increasing Pt content in the catalyst. In Fig. 2 the evolution of CH4 conversion in CH4–n–C4H10–O2–SO2 reactions over pre-sulfated 1% Pt/γ-Al2O3 and pre-sulfated 2% Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is shown. It is evident that the increase in platinum content in the catalyst resulted in an increase of the catalyst activity on methane oxidation. 3.3 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy Binding energies of core electrons of pre-sulfated 1% Pt/γ-Al2O3 and pre-sulfated 2% Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst are reported in Table 3 . Two components were observed; one at the lower binding energies (315.4eV) associated with metallic platinum. The binding energy of the Pt 4d5/2, revealed a higher binding energy component (318.5eV) that can be associated to a more oxidized species of Pt (Pt4+) [21–24]. The binding energies of Pt species were constant for both catalysts. The binding energy of the S 2p3/2 (168.9eV) revealed that S is only present as S6+, thus only sulfate species are present in the catalyst [25]. In Table 4 the atomic surface ratios of the pre-sulfated catalysts determined by XPS are indicated. In this table, it can be seen that the Pt/Al XPS signal ratio increases with Pt content in the catalyst. 4 Discussion Figs. 1 and 2 and Table 2 indicate the effect of C2H6, C3H8, or n-C4H10 on CH4–O2 reaction over pre-sulfated 1% Pt/γ-Al2O3 and pre-sulfated 2% Pt/γ-Al2O3. The increase of methane oxidation rate due to the presence of C2H6, C3H8, or n-C4H10 is explained considering two facts: • The exothermic combustions of C2H6, C3H8, or n-C4H10 [20], which initiate at lower temperatures, relative to methane combustion generate large amounts of energy according to the following reactions: (1) C2H6 +3.5O2 →2CO2 +3H2O (2) C3H8 +5O2 →3CO2 +4H2O (3) n-C4H10 +6.5O2 →4CO2 +5H2O The energy generated during the combustion of C2H6, C3H8, or n-C4H10 may be transferred to activate the rate determining step of CH4 oxidation, over the catalyst surface, increasing the reaction rate at lower temperatures, according to the mechanism proposed by Burch et al. [26] and Garetto and Apesteguia [27]. These authors interpreted the methane oxidation mechanism in terms of Mars–van Kravelen reduction–oxidation pathways, where the rate determining step is the abstraction of the first hydrogen on the adsorbed methane molecule: (4) C H 4 ⋅ L + O ⋅ L ⟶ k C H 3 ⋅ L + OH ⋅ L L is an active site. Thus, C2H6, C3H8, or n-C4H10 combustion heat may be largely transferred to reach the activation energy needed to abstract this first hydrogen. This assumption is in agreement with the results presented in Table 2. In this table it can be observed that the promotional effect of the alkane added on CH4 oxidation increases as a function of the alkane combustion heat values [20]. Moreover, Table 2 also shows that this promotional effect increased as a function of the alkane concentration. The energy generated during alkane combustion increased as a function of the alkane molecules concentration. • On the other hand, C2H6, C3H8, or n-C4H10 oxidation may lower the coverage of oxygen on the Pt surface, leaving surface active sites L free for CH4 adsorption, thus increasing its oxidation rate, since, oxygen species inhibit the reaction at full coverage [26]. It is worth noting that the promotional effect of the presence of the alkane added on CH4 oxidation increases as a function of the number of moles of oxygen necessary for the oxidation per-mole of the alkane (according to reactions 1, 2, and 3). It is well known that the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 is catalyzed by Pt at temperatures greater than 200°C [28–30] according to the following reaction: (5) SO2 +O·L→SO3 This reaction over oxygen-covered Pt may cause the removal of surface oxygen, thus may also facilitate adsorption of CH4, resulting in a further increase in the CH4 conversion. The promoting effect of the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 on methane oxidation may be the same in the presence or in the absence of alkanes. Now, results presented in Fig. 2 and Table 2 reveal that increasing Pt content in the catalyst resulted in a further strong increase of the catalytic activity for methane combustion in the presence of 2000ppmV n-butane in the reaction feed. This enhancement cannot be due to a change in platinum dispersion, since both catalysts have similar dispersion values. This enhancement cannot be due to a change of the oxidation state of Pt surface atoms, since both catalysts revealed the same binding energy values of Pt species (Table 3). This enhancement cannot be due to a change in sulfates concentration, since both catalysts have similar amounts of sulfates (Table 1). However, in Table 1 it can be seen that the number of Pt surface sites is higher in 2% Pt/γ-Al2O3 relative to 1% Pt/γ-Al2O3. This result is in agreement with the values of the atomic surface ratios determined by XPS of the catalysts (Table 4), showing an increase in Pt surface atoms as the Pt content increased. The increase in Pt surface sites results in a higher number of Pt surface active sites L for CH4 adsorption according to reaction (4). Thus the probability of CH4 adsorption increases and may result in an increase in the oxidation rate for CH4–O2 reaction. 5 Conclusions Results obtained in this investigation demonstrated the promoting effect of the presence of C2H6, C3H8, or n-C4H10 in the activation of methane oxidation over pre-sulfated Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts in CH4–O2–SO2 reactions. This promoting effect is explained on basis of the following facts: (i) C2H6, C3H8, or n-C4H10 combustion heat may be transferred to activate the CH4 dissociative adsorption over the catalyst surface increasing methane oxidation rate at lower temperatures; (ii) C2H6, C3H8, or n-C4H10 oxidation may lower the coverage of oxygen on the Pt surface, leaving surface active sites free for CH4 adsorption; (iii) the increase in Pt content in the catalyst results in an increase in Pt surface active sites for CH4 adsorption, thus the probability of CH4 adsorption increases and may result in an increase in surface Pt sites oxidation rate for CH4–O2 reaction. The results presented in this investigation suggest that the combination of both promoting effects described (i) addition of C2H6, C3H8, or n-C4H10 in the gas feed and (ii) increase of the Pt content (thus increase in the number of Pt surface active sites) may lead to a catalytic system having a very high activity for complete methane oxidation at low temperature. Such new catalytic process may eliminate low concentrations of methane emissions from lean-burn NGV exhausts.

These results are explained assuming that (i) the energy generated during the oxidation of the alkanes may be transferred to activate the rate determining step of CH4 oxidation, over the catalyst surface, increasing the reaction rate at lower temperatures and (ii) alkanes oxidation may lower the coverage of oxygen on the Pt surface, leaving surface active sites free for CH4 adsorption, thus increasing its oxidation rate, since, oxygen species act as an inhibitor for the reaction at full coverage. n-C4H10 addition in the reaction feed generated the highest promotion on CH4 complete oxidation.
