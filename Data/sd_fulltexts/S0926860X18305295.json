Clean Energy Research Center Korea Institute of Science and Technology Seoul 02792 Republic of Korea Graphical abstract The selective condensation of 2-methylfuran and furfural to C15 compounds is performed using supported phosphotungstic acid catalysts in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor. The formation of unwanted viscous tetramers (C20) is suppressed when the continuous-flow reaction system is used. Stronger acids, as measured by pKa, improved the condensation of furans, but the number of acid sites was rather weakly correlated with the catalytic activity. Suppressed catalytic activity in tiny pores smaller than 2.8–6.3 nm was also observed. Based on the observations of the acidity and pore structures, a strategy with which to design optimum catalysts for the condensation of furan compounds is suggested. Keywords 2-Methylfuran Furfural Condensation Phosphotungstic acid Continuous-flow reaction Supported catalyst 1 Introduction The production of fuels and chemicals from biomass has been suggested to replace petroleum and other fossil fuels with sustainable sources [1,2]. While lignocellulose, composed mainly of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, is a popular feedstock for biofuels [3,4], major products including fermented alcohols [2], solid fuels [5,6], and thermally degraded oils [7–11] are developed using lignocellulosic feedstocks. While glucose, as a major component of lignocellulose-derived monomeric sugars, can be widely suggested as a feedstock for producing bioalcohols and other chemicals [3,12], the valorization of unused sugars and lignin has also been investigated [4,10,13,14]. Pentoses, including xylose, are among the major sugar components prepared from lignocellulose and are not easily fermented compared to glucose. Thus, the valorization of pentose has been one of the major issues hindering the development of economically feasible lignocellulosic bioalcohols [13,15]. Furan compounds can be obtained by the dehydration of sugars, which can be converted into several useful compounds, including γ-valerolactone, levulinic acid, and aromatic compounds, for numerous applications. Furfural (FUR) prepared by the dehydration of xylose can be further hydrogenated to 2-methylfuran (2-MF) whose selective condensation to higher-carbon-number hydrocarbons (i.e., the Sylvan process) has been suggested to produce diesel-like fuels [14–20], based on the well-known selective condensation of unsaturated furans [21,22]. By avoiding the uncontrollable production of furan-based resins, high-carbon-number oligomers selectively prepared from furans can be converted to high-carbon-number hydrocarbon fuels. The catalytic condensation of 2-methylfuran (2-MF) and furfural (FUR) has been reported using resin catalysts such as Amberlyst-15 and Nafion [14]. Although the condensation of furan compounds using these resin catalysts appeared to be successful, avoiding the issues associated with mineral acids as homogeneous catalysts [14], the deactivation of these catalysts was clearly observed (Fig. 1 ) and the significant formation of cokes blocked the reactant flow and suppressed the continuous operation of the reaction. The goal of this study is to prepare the optimum heterogeneous catalysts for the selective continuous-flow condensation of furan compounds [23], which has not been reported in the literature (Table 1 ) [16–20,24]. Compared to batch reactors [16–20,24], continuous-flow reactions, including fixed-bed catalysis, are preferred for industrial applications. The catalysts are screened for the best condensation activity and the selected phosphotungstic acid was further optimized using silica supports. The effects of the properties and structures of the catalysts are investigated, and a strategy for designing the optimum catalysts is suggested. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials All chemicals were used as purchased without further purification. Phosphotungstic acid hydrate (H3PW12O4·xH2O) was purchased from Kanto Chemical (Tokyo, Japan). Silica gel (SiO2 gel, 0.060–0.2 mm or 70–230 mesh), and alumina (γ-Al2O3) were purchased from Alfa Aesar (Haverhill, Massachusetts, USA). Titanium(Ⅳ) oxide (TiO2, P25), 2-methylfuran (2-MF), furfural (FUR), and activated carbon (DARCO, 100 mesh particle size) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri, USA). Ethanol (anhydrous, 99%) was purchased from Daejung (Seoul, Korea). 2.2 Catalyst preparation A series of supported phosphotungstic acid (HPW, H3PW12O40) catalysts were prepared using an impregnation method. Phosphotungstic acid hydrate (H3PW12O4·xH2O, 1.24–1.78 g) was dissolved in anhydrous ethanol (50 mL), and a support powder (7–10 g) was added to the mixture. The resulting mixture was stirred for 24 h under ambient conditions. Using a rotary evaporator, the resulting mixture was dried at 60 °C and then further dried in air at 105 °C for 12 h. The prepared powder was calcined in air at 400 °C for 5 h. A catalyst calcined at 650 °C was also prepared for comparison. When activated carbon was used as a support, the prepared catalyst was calcined in N2 at 600 °C. Unsupported bulk HPW was dried in a vacuum at 50 °C for 16 h. The support materials used in this study were SiO2 gel with pore width of 6.3 nm, SiO2 gel with pore width of 16 nm, fumed silica, silica aerogel, MCM-41, TiO2, γ-Al2O3, and activated carbon, which were designated as Si6, Si16, SiF, SiA, MCM-41, Ti, Al, and AC, respectively. 2.3 Catalyst characterization The acidity of catalysts was measured using a NH3-temperature program desorption (NH3-TPD) method which was performed using a BELCAT-B catalyst analyzer (BEL Japan, Osaka, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a mass spectrometer (MS). Each sample was pretreated under a He flow at 250 °C for 3 h to remove physically absorbed water. After the catalyst powder was stabilized at 100 °C, 4.96% (v/v) NH3/He mixture was added to the catalyst powder in a flow rate of 10 cm3/min for 30 min. TCD signals were measured while the NH3-adosorbed catalyst powder was heated from 100 to 650 °C to determine the amount of desorbed NH3. TCD signals obtained at 100–550 °C was obtained by desorbed NH3, which was confirmed by an MS. The acidity of catalysts was measured using a potentiometric titration with Automatic Potentiometric Titrator (AT-700). n-Butylamine dissolved in acetonitrile (0.005–0.3 M) was used to measure the acidity. X-ray diffraction was performed to observe the crystal structures of the catalysts using Shimadzu XRD-6000 device equipped with a CuK α1 (λ = 0.15406 nm) source. N2-physisorption was performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument to measure BET surface areas, pore volumes, and BJH pore size distributions of catalysts. Micropore areas were measured using a t-plot analysis. Raman spectroscopy was performed using a Renishaw InVia Raman microscope with a laser beam emitting at 532 nm. Transmission electron micrographs (TEM images) were obtained using a Talos F200X device (FEI, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA) at 200 kV. Raman and TEM results were obtained at the KIST Advanced Analysis Center (Seoul, Korea). 2.4 Condensation of 2-methylfuran and furfural A mixture of 2-methylfuran (2-MF) and furfural (FUR) ((2-MF)/(FUR) = 3 (mol/mol)) was fed into a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor (1 cm I.D. and 4.5 cm in length) made of stainless steel. The catalyst powder was packed onto quartz wool. The temperature of the furnace used to heat the catalyst bed was fixed at 90 °C. The pressure of the reaction system was fixed at 30 bar using a pressurized N2 flow. The product was collected at 1–8 h of time-on-stream (TOS) and further analyzed. The prepared products were quantified using a YL HPLC equipped with a YL9170 refractive index (RI) detector and an Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm). Identification of the products was also confirmed using an Agilent 7890 A/5975C inert MS XLD gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC/MS) equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm × 250 μm). The catalysis results were calculated using the HPLC results, as follows: Conversion of reactant, i (%) = (mol of reactant, i, consumed)/(mol of reactant, i, entering the reactor) × 100 Yield of product, j (%) = 3 × (mol of trimer product, j)/(mol of all C5 reactants entering the reactor) × 100 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Condensation of furans using supported phosphotungstic acid catalysts While the heteropoly acids were predicted to be highly active catalysts for the acid-initiated condensation of furan compounds, the use of heteropoly acids, phosphotungstic acid (HPW, H3PW12O40) in this study, for the continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor did not allow the stable operation of the reaction system because of significant plugging which arose during the reaction (Fig. 1). Thus, supported heteropoly acids were prepared using several widely used supports, and their catalytic activity in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor was observed (Fig. 2 (a) and Table S1). Among Si6, Ti, and Al used as supports, HPW supported on Si6 exhibited the highest yields of trimers. The formation of furan tetramers, previously observed when the reaction occurred without water [14], and furan dimers was not observed for any reaction in this study. The formation of trimer 1 was highly preferred with (2-MF)/(FUR) = 3 (mol/mol). The preferred formation of trimer 1 does not require the acid-driven ring opening of 2-MF, which is required for the trimerization of 2-MF to trimer 2 [14]. With a longer contact time or lower LHSV = 1 h−1, the formation of trimer 2 was observed (Table S1). The suggested reaction pathways indicated that water formed during the preparation of trimer 1, which must be used for the ring opening of furans for the production of trimer 2 (Fig. 3 ) [14]. Based on the observations in Fig. 2(a), Si6 is selected as the optimum support in this study. Based on the observations presented in Fig. 2(a), the adjusted catalytic activity of HPW on different supports was examined more closely. The acidity and pore structures of the catalysts were observed (Table 2 ). HPW/Si6 with a high BET surface area and a large quantity of acid sites exhibited the larger yields of trimers. When the HPW structure was degraded by calcination at 650 °C, as depicted by the XRD and Raman results (Fig. S1), the catalytic activity worsened and the acid sites were significantly decreased in number. These observations indicate that the Keggin structure of HPW is required to achieve acid-driven higher catalytic activity. The n-butylamine titration of the catalysts indicated that the stronger acids of the catalysts significantly improved the condensation activity (Fig. 4 (a)), while larger quantities of the acid sites did not correspondingly increase the condensation activity of the catalysts (Fig. 2(a) and Table 2). Based on pKa as measured by n-butylamine titration, the HPW/Si6 exhibited the lowest pKa or the strongest acidity producing the largest yield of trimers. Although HPW/Ti and HPW/Al exhibited more acid sites according to n-butylamine titration and NH3-TPD measurements, respectively, they exhibited more positive pKa values or weaker acidity, producing lower yields of trimers. The supported HPW catalysts were stable up to 400 °C and degraded when heated to 650 °C in air, as observed in the XRD and Raman results (Fig. S1). Highly dispersed HPW catalysts did not exhibit any characteristic peaks in the XRD and Raman results, but the peaks of tungsten oxide (WO3) were observed when the catalysts were heated to 650 °C. The calcination temperature (400 °C) used in this study (see Section 2.2) was determined based on these results. Bulk crystalline HPW exhibited the Keggin structure [25], but it was degraded to form WO3 particles when calcined at 650 °C [26]. The Raman spectra of bulk HPW also exhibited a thermal transition of the Keggin structure, with peaks at ∼1000 cm−1, to WO3, with peaks at ∼800 cm−1 [27]. For the 15 wt% HPW/Si6, the transition of highly dispersed HPW on the Si6, as confirmed by the absence of peaks in the Raman and XRD results, to WO3 particles, a finding confirmed by the presence of WO3 crystals in the XRD results and from the mixture of WO3 and HPW in the Raman results, was also observed after calcination at 650 °C. The 15 wt% HPW/Al also exhibited a transition of the highly dispersed Keggin structure (no peak in the XRD result) to WO3 particles (weak peaks in the XRD result) during calcination at 650 °C. 15 wt% HPW/Ti did not exhibit appreciable peaks of HPW, instead exhibiting peaks of a highly crystalline mixture of anatase and rutile TiO2 in the Raman and XRD results. The highly dispersed HPW particles on Si6 and AC, when calcined at 400 °C, were also observed in the EDS-equipped HAADF-STEM images (Fig. S2). The significant agglomeration of HPW particles was not observed for spent catalysts of HPW/Si6 and HPW/AC, which indicates the mild reaction conditions of 90 °C and 30 bar did not degrade the catalysts. When HPW was deposited on Ti and Al supports, the agglomeration of HPW particles were observed at the edge of support particles even for the fresh catalysts calcined at 400 °C. 3.2 Effects of the catalyst loading on the condensation With the selection of Si6 as an optimum support, the loadings of HPW were manipulated and the catalytic activity of these Si6-supported HPW catalysts was measured (Fig. 2(b) and Table S2). Increasing the HPW loading increased the yield of the trimers, with the maximum yield of 43.0% reached with 15 wt% HPW/Si6. Greater loadings decreased the yields of the trimers. Note that the increased HPW loading did not significantly manipulate the pore structures of HPW/Si6, as noted by observing the BJH pore size distribution, suppressing the possible manipulation of the mass transfer limitation by the deposition of HPW (Fig. S3). The quantity of acid sites was assessed to understand the role of acidity on the yield of the trimers (Table 3 ). An increased amount of HPW loading proportionally increased the number of acid sites regardless of the measurement method, which indicated that the yield of the trimers did not solely depend on the quantity of acid sites and that other descriptors must be investigated. For the production of trimers from a mixture of 2-MF and FUR ((2-MF)/(FUR) = 3 (mol/mol)), the conversions of 2-MF and FUR must have occurred at a ratio of 1.5 (%/%) when trimer 1 formed with 100% selectivity. The highest condensation activity observed for the 15 wt% HPW/Si6 can be attributed to the optimum deposition of HPW with less agglomeration of HPW molecules on the silica support; greater loading of HPW did not increase the active acid sites because of the agglomeration of HPW. While EDS-equipped HAADF-STEM images of the 5–15 wt% HPW/Si6 catalysts exhibited the agglomeration of tungsten-containing catalyst particles along with highly dispersed particles, the agglomeration became more significant with the 20–35 wt% HPW/Si6 (Fig. S4). Even when more acid sites are loaded initially, a large fraction of the acid sites cannot be used during the short contact time because of the poor dispersion of HPW. The optimum acidity of the 15 wt% HPW/Si6 can be confirmed by assessing the pKa measured via n-butylamine titration (Fig. 4(b)). Although the quantity of acid sites was not closely correlated with the yield of the trimers (Fig. 2(b) and Table 3), the pKa of the catalysts, representing the strength of the acids, was well correlated with the yield of the trimers; larger yields were observed with stronger acids with more negative values of pKa. The most negative pKa was observed with the 15 wt% HPW/Si6, although the quantity of acid sites was not the largest in this case, as described in Table 3. 3.3 Effects of the pore structures on the condensation In addition to the mesoporous Si6 support used in Fig. 2(a) and (b), other porous silica supports were investigated to understand the effects of the pore structures and to determine the optimum pore diameters to obtain the best condensation activity (Figs. 2(c), S5, Table S3, and 4). Among the Si6, Si16 (SiO2 gel with 16.0 nm pores), SiF, SiA, and MCM-41, Si6-supported catalysts exhibited the highest trimer yields (Fig. 2(c)). Note that the Si6 and Si16 supports exhibited different BJH-measured pore widths of 6.3 and 16.0 nm. Based on their acidity as measured by the titration of n-butylamine, the 15 wt% HPW/Si6 exhibited the highest number of acid sites per volume of catalyst because of its large apparent density, indicating that the catalyst bed of the 15 wt% HPW/Si6 must contain the largest number of acid sites when the LHSV was fixed during the continuous-flow reaction (Table 4 ). More acid sites in the catalyst bed increased the yield of the trimers, as observed in Tables 3 and 4. Although the catalytic activity was nearly proportional to the number of acid sites present in the catalyst bed, MCM-41-supported HPW exhibited the lowest yield of trimers compared to the activity predicted based on the number of acid sites (Fig. 5 ). MCM-41 does not contain micropores, but it does have very small mesopores with a peak width of 2.8 nm. These small mesopores could absorb the HPW catalyst during the preparation of the supported catalysts, but the mass transfer of reactants and products must be significantly suppressed and the HPW inside the small mesopores was less active. Compared to MCM-41, the Si6, whose BJH peak pore width was 6.3 nm, and the SiA, whose BJH peak pore width was 16.0 nm, did not exhibit suppressed catalytic activity by their mesopores, indicating that mesopores larger than 2.8–6.3 nm did not suppress the mass transfer of reactants and products here. The fumed silica (SiF) and silica aerogel (SiA), which did not contain micropores, did not exhibit catalytic activity adjusted by micropores (Fig. 5). Thus, micropores do not manipulate the catalysis by adjusting the mass transfer. Because of a mild reaction temperature and despite the reaction pressure of 30 bar, the pore structures did not change significantly during the reaction (Fig. S6). Although the pore volume was decreased or increased, the collapse of the pore structure did not occur exhibiting almost identical pore width for fresh and spent catalysts. The less agglomeration of HPW particles during the reaction at 90 °C and 30 bar was also confirmed with EDS-equipped HAADF-STEM images (Fig. S7) as observed in Figs. S2 and S4, which demonstrates that the high dispersion of HPW particles cannot significantly degrade during the condensation reaction in this study. 3.4 Design of acid catalysts for the condensation Based on the above results of the acidities and the pore structures of catalysts correlated with the condensation activity, the strategy to design the optimum catalysts for the condensation of furans can be suggested. First, the continuous-flow reaction can suppress the formation of viscous tetramers including 3 in Scheme 1 . The manipulation of contact time can further suppress the formation of trimer 2 to achieve the selective condensation of furans. Second, the larger quantity of acid sites (Fig. 5) or the stronger acidity (Fig. 4) can improve the condensation. Third, the mesopores at 2.8–6.3 nm may suppress the formation of furans but the micropores may not improve the catalytic activity. Based on these observations, the improved catalyst design can be possible while HPW/Si6 was the optimum catalyst in this study. The design of tailor-made catalysts based on these observations is currently on its way based on these observations. 4 Conclusion The selective condensation of furan compounds to C15 products was performed as a precursor to produce high-carbon-number hydrocarbon fuels. Compared to a batch reaction of furan condensation, a continuous-flow fixed-bed reaction system exhibits the benefit of more selective condensation to desired products. While the use of unsupported heteropoly acid catalysts significantly oligomerized furan compounds to deactivate the reaction, the supported heteropoly acid catalysts moderately manipulated the catalysis. The catalytic condensation activity based on the acidity and pore structures of the catalysts was observed, and it was found that more acid sites with moderate mesopores exceeding the range of 2.8–6.3 nm are required to improve the condensation activity. The stronger acidity exhibiting more negative pKa, slightly rather than the quantity of acid sites, also improves the condensation activity. Based on the observations in this study, a strategy to design optimum catalysts is suggested.
