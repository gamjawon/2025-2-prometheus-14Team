Greece Received 10 December 1995; revised 13 February 1996; accepted 13 February 1996 Abstract A spent Pt-NiO/A1203 industrial catalyst was examined with respect to Pt recovery. Aluminum chloride solutions, with low concentrations of nitric acid as an oxidant, were used instead of \"aqua regia\". The effect of aluminum chloride and nitric acid concentrations on the yield of platinum dissolution was studied. The substitution of hydrochloric acid by aluminum chloride, with low nitric acid concentration, does not affect the platinum dissolution yield, but minimizes excess reagents consumption.

Introduction Platinum is refractory, chemically inert at elevated temperatures to a wide variety of materials and displays excellent catalytic activity. These properties are the basis of the principal uses, as a catalyst in the automotive, chemical and petroleum refining industries, and a corrosion resistant material in the chemical, electrical, glass, and dental medical industries [1]. EC's demand for platinum and its uses are shown in Fig. 1 [2]. The demand for catalytic applications and especially for autocatalysts, predominates and increases continuously from 1985 to 1990. Since platinum is a rare and valuable metal and all demand in Europe is covered by imports (mainly from South Africa and the ex-USSR), the signifi- cance of platinum recovery from used catalysts is obvious [1-4]. Catalysts, after a certain period of active life and regeneration cycles, are deactivated. Spent catalysts are an excellent source of secondary platinum since * Corresponding author. Fax.

Platinum demand in EC countries per year and use [2]. they contain the metal in considerably higher concentrations than the ores from which it is extracted [1]. Regarding reclamation economics, it has been proved how critical it is to reclaim the full amount of a precious metal in a spent catalyst [5,6]. Thus, the reclaiming procedure should ensure that the metals are recovered by the most efficient means. A critical stage in the whole recovery procedure is the separation of the platinum from the other materials, which the catalyst structure is consisted of (mainly the substrate, in most cases \"y-alumina). Platinum is separated from the catalyst substrate with a variety of techniques, which may be classified in two major groups: hydrometallurgical and pyrometal- lurgical. Hydrometallurgical processes are classified in [7-9]: 1. Substrate dissolution. The substrate is dissolved with a non-oxidizing acid or base. The noble metals are not dissolved, remaining in an insoluble sludge. 2. Solution extraction. The noble metals are extracted from the substrate by an acidic solution of an oxidant, leaving the bulk of the substrate unaffected. In each of these cases, after the removal from the substrate is completed, platinum is recovered by conventional chemical procedures [8]. In general, the substrate dissolution processes require large amounts of reagents and pose severe waste disposal problems if the solution is not recycled to alumina. While such a process may be economically practical for highly loaded catalysts, it seems unlikely that it could be economically applied to low-loaded catalysts as the one used in this study. As far as aluminum substrate is concerned, 3~-alumina is readily dissolved while e~-alumina is not; thus, catalysts used in high temperature applications which promote a \",/ to eL phase transition, are not easily processed by these methods. Solution extraction processes are based mainly on the dissolution of platinum in the form of chloride complexes. The stabilities of the platinum cations and the respective chloride complex in aqueous solutions are compared in Figs. 2 and 3. The platinum chloride complexes are quite stable at pH values below 1 to T.N. Angelidis, E.

Hydrochloric acid is normally used as the source of chlorides and the required acidity. Oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, chlorates, bromine or chlorine may be used but nitric acid is preferred due to the higher dissolution yield achieved, mainly through the production of elemental active chlorine. The simplified chemical reaction is the following: 3Pt + 4HNO3 + 18HCI ~ 3HzPtC16 + 4NO + 8H20 (1) (many other products of nitric acid decomposition may also be present). Such conditions are assured by leaching at 70-95 with \"aqua regia\" [14-16]. Leaching with \"aqua regia\" at temperatures above 70 is extremely difficult in industrial practice because of the highly aggressive nature of both the solution and the gaseous products of its decomposition.

Angelidis, E. Skouraki / Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 387-395 is marked by a high partial pressure of gaseous hydrogen chloride, a substantial nitric acid decomposition with evolution of nitrogen oxides and an excess chloride consumption due to their oxidation to gaseous chlorine [17]. Such loss of oxidizing agent (nitric acid) and complexing agent (chlorides) retards the rate of dissolution and increases the leaching time. This, in turn, promotes undesir- able dissolution of the alumina substrate, with additional consumption of acids. The replacement of a part of hydrochloric acid with another complexing agent source such as a non-volatile chloride salt was proved to overcome the above drawbacks [14,15]. Aluminum chloride is preferred, since it provides three chloride ions per molecule of A1C13 used, compared to other common chloride salts (NaC1, KC1, CaC12 or MgC12) and the presence of aluminum ions reduces the rate of the substrate dissolution. The main effort of the present research work was to examine in what extent the substitution of hydrochloric acid by aluminum chloride influences the platinum dissolution yield and the gaseous product evolution from a spent industrial catalyst. The nitric acid and the aluminum chloride concentration effect on platinum dissolution was also studied. 2. Experimental The spent Pt-NiO/~-A1203 catalyst (C53-1, Catalysts and Chemicals Eu- rope S.A.) was obtained from the nitrogen production unit of the EKO petro- chemical plant in Thessaloniki, Greece. The unit and the catalyst descriptions are presented elsewhere [18]. The spent catalyst was in the form of cylindrical pellets (6.5 6.5 mm). A sample of pellets (about 1 kg) was selected from the spent catalyst discharge pile. The pellets were ground to 200 mesh powder by a porcelain ball mill. The powder was dried (by heating at 120 for 24 h) and samples of this powder were used for the chemical analysis and the dissolution experiments (2 g each time). Chemical analysis of the specific powder gave the following results [18]: 0.125% Pt, 2.5% Ni, 0.28% Zn, 0.05% Fe, 0.02% Cu, 2.8% carbonaceous material and 5% humidity (all quantities in w/w wet base). The platinum concentration of the dried powder (0.131% w/w dry base) was used for dissolution yield calculations. Analytical grade hydrochloric acid, nitric acid and hydrated aluminum chlo- ride were used as dissolution reagents. The leaching solution was produced after proper dilution to a final volume of 100 ml. The leaching tests were carried out in a two-neck spherical glass vessel (250 ml) equipped with a thermometer. The vessel was heated by a controlled temperature heater. A glass water cooler was placed on the central neck to prevent water vapors and soluble gases from escaping. Insoluble gases produced during the dissolution procedure were passed through the cooler and were selected in an inverted volumetric cylinder placed in a water bath. T.N. Angelidis, E.

Platinum recovery yield as a function of time at extreme boiling point conditions: (a) 103 (AICI3 2 M, HNO3 I M), (b) 109 (HC1 6 M, HNO3 1 M). Separate batch experiments for each time period. In all cases the reactants were heated up to the boiling point which, depending on the solution composition, was between 103 and 109. Heating up to boiling point prevents soluble gases (especially hydrogen chloride) from escaping, since they return to the reaction vessel with the condensed water vapors. The maximum boiling point was observed when only hydrochloric acid was used as a source of chlorides, since hydrochloric acid is a maximum boiling azeotrope [19]. The minimum boiling point temperature was observed when only aluminum chloride was used as a source of chlorides. Separate preliminary tests carried out at the extreme conditions of the boiling point for various reaction time periods (Fig. 4), show that in both cases platinum dissolution reaches its maximum yield after 30 min. So, the reaction time was fixed to 1 h in all batch experiments, to ensure complete platinum dissolution. After the completion of the reaction the reactants mixture was hot-filtered and the remaining solids were thoroughly washed with hydrochloric acid (1/1) to remove any platinum complex traces adsorbed. The filtrate was diluted to the proper volume and was analyzed for platinum by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS, Perkin Elmer 2380). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Hydrochloric acid substitution effect A series of experiments was carried out with constant nitric concentration (1 M) and stepwise substitution of hydrochloric acid by an equivalent in chlorides quantity of aluminum chloride. At the initial experiment the hydrochloric acid 392 T.N. Angelidis, E.

The results of these experiments are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. In Fig. 5 the platinum recovery % is presented as a function of hydrochloric acid substitution. It is obvious that hydrochloric substitution by aluminum chloride does not affect the yield of platinum dissolution.

Angelidis, E. Skouraki / Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 387-395 393 (mean value 98.4%, mean absolute error (MAE) 1.03%, n = 5). This fluctuation is attributed to possible analytical errors originated from the low sensitivity of AAS for platinum measurements (MAE for chemical analysis represents a 2.25% MAE on platinum recovery yield). In Fig. 6 the influence of the hydrochloric acid substitution on gaseous material production is shown. The volumes quoted in Fig. 6 are net volumes derived after the subtraction of the initial void volume of the experimental apparatus (about 200 ml) from the total gas volume measured at the end of each experiment. The volume of released gases is reduced by 60% as aluminum chloride substitutes hydrochloric acid. Since gases are mainly produced, by side reactions (nitric acid decomposition, gaseous hydrochloric acid vapors and chlorine gas production), the reduction of the total gases volume is connected with reduction of reactant losses, as hydrochloric acid is substituted by non- volatile aluminum chloride. With respect to the composition of the collected gas products, it is expected to consist of insoluble in water chlorine, insoluble at high temperatures nitrogen oxides (e.g. NO) and initially trapped atmospheric air, since hydrogen chloride and soluble nitrogen oxides (e.g. N20, N203, N20s) return back to the reaction vessel following the reflux of the cooler [19]. 3.2. Aluminum chloride and nitric acid concentrations effect Furthermore, experiments were carried out in order to study the influence of aluminum chloride concentration on platinum recovery. The nitric acid concen- tration was kept constant (1 M) and no hydrochloric acid was added at all. The 100 % Pt RECOVERY 80 60 40 20 0 o o,5 1 1,5 2 AICI3, M Fig. 7.

Platinum recovery yield as a function of nitric acid concentration (aluminum chloride concentration 2 M, hydrochloric acid concentration 0 M). results are shown in Fig. 7. Aluminum chloride concentration has a considerable effect on the platinum recovery yield. The platinum recovery yield increases as aluminum chloride concentration increases. This effect is expected, since in- creased chlorides concentrations are strongly connected with the stability of the soluble platinum complexes. Only at high aluminum chloride concentrations (near 2 M), the platinum recovery yield reaches its maximum value. A second series of experiments was performed in order to study the nitric acid concentration effect on the platinum recovery yield. The aluminum chloride concentration was kept constant (2 M). The results are shown in Fig. 8. The platinum recovery yield increases as nitric acid concentration increases. The low recovery yield observed at low nitric acid concentrations is possibly connected with nitric acid losses through decomposition and side reactions with the other catalyst constituents (alumina and metals). It must be pointed out that in this case the pH of the solution depends only on nitric acid concentration, since hydrochloric acid is absent. 4. Conclusion A series of batch experiments show that the substitution of hydrochloric acid by aluminum chloride and the use of low nitric acid concentrations instead of \"aqua regia\" do not affect considerably the platinum recovery from a powdered industrial platinum based catalyst. Further investigation is in progress with respect to the dissolution of the other catalyst constituents and the selection of the proper separation technique for platinum recovery from the leachant.
