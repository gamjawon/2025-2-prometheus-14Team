Graphical abstract 1,4-Butanediol was selectively dehydrated into 3-buten-1-ol with producing a small amount of THF and γ-butyrolactone over sodium-modified ZrO2 at temperatures of 325–375°C, where 3-buten-1-ol is possibly formed by acid–base bifunctional catalysis of monoclinic ZrO2. Dehydration of 1,4-butanediol was investigated over ZrO2 at temperatures of 325–375°C. Modification of ZrO2 with a small amount of sodium hydroxide greatly enhanced the selectivity to 3-buten-1-ol. Temperature-programmed desorption of adsorbed NH3 and CO2 elucidated acidity and basicity of the catalysts, respectively. The number of acidic sites on the ZrO2 decreased with increasing Na content, and disappeared at Na content of 1.0mol%, whereas the number of basic sites increased with increasing Na content. In the relationship between Na content and the selectivity to products, selectivities to tetrahydrofuran and γ-butyrolactone simply increased with the number of acidic and basic sites, respectively. However, the selectivity to 3-buten-1-ol was maximized at an appropriate Na content. 3-Butan-1-ol is possibly formed by acid–base-concerted catalysis of monoclinic ZrO2 in the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol. Keywords Zirconia Dehydration 1,4-Butanediol 3-Buten-1-ol 1 Introduction Recently, we have reported that homoallyl alcohol such as 3-buten-1-ol is produced in the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol over pure CeO2 at temperatures of 400–425°C [1]. 3-Buten-1-ol is synthesized with the maximum selectivity of 68mol% and the yield of 60% at 400°C. In the reaction, however, consecutive reactions such as isomerization of 3-buten-1-ol, dehydrogenation and hydrogenation proceed. CeO2 also catalyzes the formation of allylic alcohols from 1,3-diols at 325°C [2–4]: 3-buten-2-ol and 2-buten-1-ol are produced with the sum of the selectivity >99mol% from 1,3-butanediol. 1,4-Butanediol, however, is rarely dehydrated to 3-buten-1-ol over CeO2 at such low temperature of 325°C [1]. In the latest paper, we have reported that ZrO2 with monoclinic crystal phase also catalyzes the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol into 3-buten-1-ol at 325–375°C [5]. In the dehydration, tetrahydrofuran (THF) is competitively produced, while other by-products such as 2-buten-1-ol, 2-butenal, and 1-butanol, which are observed over CeO2, are suppressed over ZrO2 at 325°C. The selectivity to 3-buten-1-ol over the ZrO2, however, is lower than that over CeO2 because of a moderate amount of THF produced. 1,4-Butanediol is readily dehydrocyclized into THF over solid acids such as SiO2–Al2O3, Al2O3 [1], cation exchange resin [6], and heteropoly acids [7]. Thus, we speculated that acid–base property of ZrO2 influences the selectivity to products in the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol. ZrO2 shows attractive catalyses for various reactions such as isosynthesis from synthesis gas [8–10], dehydration of secondary alcohols [11,12], hydrogenation of conjugated dienes [13], isomerization of 1-butene [14], ketonization of alcohols, aldehydes [15] and carboxylic acids [16–18], dehydrogenation of alkylamines into nitriles [19]. ZrO2 is also known as a bifunctional catalyst with acidic and basic sites [20]. ZrO2 catalysts modified with Al2O3 and KOH have acidic and basic sites, respectively, and are effective for the isosynthesis from synthesis gas [9]: a ratio of basic to acidic sites on the catalysts determines the percentage of iso-C4 in the total C4 hydrocarbons. In this paper, we investigated catalytic activity of sodium-modified ZrO2 in the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol, to improve the selectivity to 3-buten-1-ol. We also examined acid–base properties of the catalysts using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of adsorbed NH3 and CO2. Then, we discussed the catalysis of ZrO2 in the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol in connection with the acid–base properties. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation A monoclinic ZrO2 with the average particle size of 5μm was supplied by Daiichi Kigenso Chemical Industry, Japan. Sodium-modified ZrO2 samples were prepared by impregnation, incipient wetness. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution with the concentration of 3–40mmoldm−3 was impregnated to the monoclinic ZrO2 to obtain precursors. Other modified ZrO2 were prepared by the impregnation using either LiOH, KOH, or H3PO4 solution with the concentration of 8mmoldm−3 instead of using NaOH. Finally, the precursors were dried at 100°C for 24h and calcined at 400°C for 3h in air. The ZrO2 catalysts, which are modified with NaOH, LiOH, KOH, and H3PO4, are abbreviated as Na-ZrO2, Li-ZrO2, K-ZrO2, and P-ZrO2, respectively. A tetragonal ZrO2 was prepared by adding a 0.5moldm−3 NaOH solution into a solution of zirconyl nitrate (ZrO(NO3)2·2H2O) with the concentration of 5mass% under stirring at room temperature. The mixture was further stirred at room temperature for 1h and allowed to stand at room temperature for 24h. The resulting precipitate was filtered and washed with distilled water until the pH of the solution became ca. 9.5. The precipitate was dried at 110°C for 24h to obtain a precursor. Finally, a tetragonal ZrO2 was obtained by calcinating the precursor at 500°C for 3h in air. CeO2 was a commercially available reagent and was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industry Ltd., Japan. Al2O3 was supplied by Dia Catalyst, DC-2282. 2.2 Catalytic reaction The dehydration of 1,4-butanediol was carried out in a fixed-bed flow reactor, which was made of glass with inside diameter of 20mm, under atmospheric pressure of He at temperatures of 325–375°C. Prior to the reaction, a catalyst sample, 0.3–1.0g, was preheated in the He flow at 500°C for 1h. After the catalyst bed had been set at a prescribed temperatures between 325 and 375°C, 1,4-butanediol was fed into the reactor at a liquid flow rate of 1.77cm3 h−1 together with a He gas flow of 73mmolh−1. An effluent collected periodically was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-8A, Shimadzu, Japan) with a 30-m capillary column (TC-WAX, GL Science, Japan) and GC-MS (GCMS-QP5050A, Shimadzu, Japan) with a 30-m capillary column (DB-WAX, Agilent Technologies, USA). Gaseous products such as 1,3-butadiene were analyzed by on-line gas chromatography (GC-8A) with a 1-m packed column (Porapak Q). As has been shown in Fig. 2 of Ref. [5], ZrO2 catalysts have stable conversion of 1,4-butanediol at 325°C with time on stream after the initial 3h. Then, we evaluated the catalytic activity using the average conversion and selectivity in the initial 5h. 2.3 Characterization The TPD of adsorbed NH3 was measured by neutralization titration using an electric conductivity cell immersed in an aqueous solution of H2SO4 to estimate acidity of the catalysts, as has been described in the TPD experiment of adsorbed NH3 [21–26]. A sample (ca. 50mg) was preheated in a quartz tube at 500°C for 1h under a reduced pressure of 1.3Pa. NH3 vapor with 13kPa was introduced to the sample at 100°C for 30min, and then evacuated at 100°C for 1h to remove the physisorbed NH3 on the catalyst. After no NH3 had been observed in N2 flow, the sample was heated from 100 to 600°C at a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 under N2 flow of 15mlmin−1. The desorbed NH3, together with N2 gas, was bubbled into an electric conductivity cell containing a 0.5mmoldm−3 H2SO4 solution (50cm3). The amount of desorbed NH3 was monitored by the change in the conductivity of the solution. A cumulative amount of desorbed NH3 was obtained as a function of the desorbed temperature and then differentiated to give a TPD profile as an acid strength distribution. In this paper, the number of the acidic sites is calculated in the temperature range from 100 to 600°C by an assumption in which one NH3 molecule adsorbs to one acidic site on the catalyst surface. The TPD of adsorbed CO2 was also examined by neutralization titration in 2.0mmoldm−3 of an NaOH solution to estimate basicity of the catalyst, as has been described elsewhere [26]. The catalyst loaded in a quartz tube was preheated at 500°C for 1h under a reduced pressure in the same way as the NH3 adsorption described above. After the pretreatment, the quartz tube was filled with CO2 gas at room temperature for 72h. The following procedures for TPD experiment of adsorbed CO2 were performed according to the TPD of adsorbed NH3, except for using an NaOH solution to titrate the desorbed CO2. The number of the basic sites is defined as the number of desorbed CO2 in the temperature range from 25 to 600°C. The specific surface areas of samples were calculated with BET method using nitrogen adsorption isotherm at −196°C. XRD patterns were recorded with M18XHF (Mac Science). 3 Results 3.1 Dehydration of 1,4-butanediol over modified ZrO2 Table 1 lists distribution of products in the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol over various catalysts. Over phosphorous-modified ZrO2 (P-ZrO2) and tetragonal ZrO2, THF is mainly produced together with a small amount of 3-buten-1-ol at 325°C, while γ-butyrolactone is hardly produced. Over CeO2 at 425°C, 3-buten-1-ol is produced with a small amount of THF and γ-butyrolactone. Al2O3 selectively catalyzes the dehydrative cyclization of 1,4-butanediol into THF at 275°C. 3-Buten-1-ol and THF are produced from 1,4-butanediol at a ratio of ca. 1:1 over monoclinic ZrO2 at 325°C. In the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol over sodium-modified ZrO2 (Na-ZrO2) at 325°C, the conversion of 1,4-butanediol gradually decreases with increasing Na content (Table 1). Fig. 1 shows the relationship between Na content and the selectivity in the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol over sodium-modified ZrO2 at 325°C. The selectivity to 3-buten-1-ol increases with increasing the Na content, and exceeds 70% at Na contents of 1.0–1.5mol%. The selectivity to THF steeply decreases, and that to γ-butyrolactone (GBL) gradually increases with increasing the Na content. At high Na contents above 1.5mol%, the selectivity to 3-buten-1-ol gradually decreases as the Na content increases because of increase in the selectivity to γ-butyrolactone, which results from the dehydrogenative cyclization of 1,4-butanediol. In addition, Na-ZrO2 shows the highest selectivity to 3-buten-1-ol among the three alkali-modified ZrO2. Fig. 2 shows temperature dependence of catalytic activity of Na-ZrO2 at Na content of 1.5mol%, together with pure monoclinic ZrO2. The average conversion for initial 5h increases as reaction temperature increases (Fig. 2A). The addition of sodium decreases the conversion of 1,4-butanediol at the same reaction temperature. At temperatures of 325–375°C, the selectivity to 3-buten-1-ol over the Na-ZrO2 is higher than that over pure monoclinic ZrO2, and exceeds 62mol% (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the selectivity to THF over Na-ZrO2 decreases to below 28mol%. Fig. 3 depicts change in the composition of reactant and products with contact time in the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol over Na-ZrO2 at Na content of 1.5mol%, at 350°C. The contact time, W/F, is defined as a time factor in a flow reactor, where W and F are a catalyst weight and a flow rate of 1,4-butanediol, respectively. The composition of 1,4-butanediol decreases as the contact time increases. The composition of 3-buten-1-ol, i.e. the space-time yield, increases with increasing the contact time. The total yield of by-products including 1,3-butadiene, 2-buten-1-ol, 2-butenal and 1-butanol, which are converted from 3-buten-1-ol, is less than 1.0mol% at W/F below 0.339ghcm−3 at 350°C. 3.2 Characterization of sodium-modified ZrO2 catalyst Fig. 4 illustrates TPD profiles of NH3 and CO2 adsorbed on the catalysts. In the TPD experiments of adsorbed NH3 (Fig. 4A), both monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 have desorption peaks at around 300°C. In the ZrO2 modified with NaOH, the desorption peak at 300°C declines gradually with increasing Na content, and disappears at Na content of 1.0mol%. In addition, no new desorption peaks are observed in the Na-ZrO2. The ZrO2 modified with H3PO4 (P-ZrO2) also has desorption peak at around 300°C without new desorption peak. These results indicate that modification of ZrO2 with acidic and basic solutions does not vary the original acid strength of ZrO2. Al2O3 has desorption peak at ca. 430°C [25], which is higher than those of the ZrO2 samples. CeO2 has no desorption peak in the temperature range. In the TPD of CO2 adsorbed on the modified ZrO2 (Fig. 4B), the CO2 desorption peaks are obtained at around 120°C in the catalysts used in this study, and no new desorption peaks are observed. On the other hand, desorption peak is obtained at around 150°C for CeO2 catalyst. The results indicate that these catalysts have weak basic sites on the surface, and that CeO2 has stronger basic sites on its surface than the other catalysts used in this work. Table 2 summarizes the physical properties of the catalysts used in this work. The monoclinic ZrO2 without modification has both acidic and basic sites, as shown in Fig. 4. Moreover, the basic sites are present ca. three times as much as the acidic sites on the monoclinic ZrO2. As the Na content increases, the number of acidic sites steeply decreases and disappears at Na content of 1.0mol%, while number of basic sites gradually increases (Table 2). Modification of ZrO2 with H3PO4 causes the decrease in the number of basic sites. In addition, modification with NaOH and H3PO4 results in a slight change in the original specific surface area of monoclinic ZrO2. The tetragonal ZrO2 also has both acidic and basic sites, where the basic sites are present ca. three times as much as the acidic sites. Al2O3 also has much basic sites than acidic sites. Table 2 also lists densities of acidic and basic sites of the samples calculated by dividing the number of sites by specific surface area. The densities of acidic and basic sites on the unmodified monoclinic ZrO2 are roughly twice as large as those on the tetragonal one. Fig. 5 shows the relation between selectivities to the major products and number of acidic and basic sites. The selectivity to THF increases with increasing the number of acidic sites (Fig. 5A). However, the selectivity to 3-buten-1-ol seems to be independent of the acidity. In contrast, the selectivity to γ-butyrolactone increases with increasing the number of basic sites (Fig. 5B), while the selectivity to 3-buten-1-ol shows a maximum. Fig. 6 illustrates XRD profiles of the ZrO2 catalysts used in this study. The diffraction peaks of the monoclinic ZrO2 are observed at 2θ =24.3°, 28.4°, 31.6°, 34.5°, 41.0°, 45.3°, 50.1° and 55.5°, and those of the tetragonal one are at 2θ =30.2°, 35.1°, 50.4°, and 60.1°. The sodium- and phosphorous-modified ZrO2 catalysts have the monoclinic structures. The monoclinic structure of ZrO2 is maintained even after the modification. In addition, no new peaks, which are ascribed to Na2O, Na2CO3, phosphates etc., are observed in the modified ZrO2 catalysts. 4 Discussion 4.1 Surface properties of ZrO2 ZrO2 has been known as a bifunctional catalyst with acidic and basic sites [20,27]. Xu et al. reported that monoclinic ZrO2 had both acidic and basic sites on its surface in the TPD experiments of adsorbed NH3 and CO2 [20]. They found that preadsorbed NH3 enhanced the adsorption of post-adsorbing CO2 in the case that acidic and basic sites were located closely. On the other hand, this type of interaction was not found on solid acid such as SiO2–Al2O3 or solid base such as MgO. In the present study, both weak acidic and basic sites are present on the monoclinic ZrO2. This is consistent with their results. It has also been reported that monoclinic ZrO2 has larger adsorption capacity of CO2 than tetragonal ZrO2 does in the TPD experiment of adsorbed CO2 [28]. This is also consistent with the present results that monoclinic ZrO2 is more basic than tetragonal one. Thus, it is obvious that the crystalline structures of ZrO2 influence the acid–base property. Cerrato et al. reported that several OH groups were present on the surface of monoclinic ZrO2 calcined in air even at 600°C in FTIR spectroscopy [29]. We speculate that the ZrO2 surface is covered with OH groups, and that the surface OH groups of ZrO2 are ion-exchanged with Na+ to form ONa species by neutralization with NaOH. If a proton of OH groups of ZrO2 surface is exchanged with sodium cations, all the acidic OH groups would be converted into ONa species at Na content of 0.70mol%, which is calculated from the number of total acidic sites of monoclinic ZrO2 (Table 2). Thus, it is reasonable that the acidic sites disappear at Na content of 1.0mol% in the present work. In contrast, the number of basic sites increases with the increase in Na content (Table 2). The results indicate that ONa groups, which are formed by ion exchange of the surface OH groups on ZrO2 with NaOH, adsorb CO2, namely an ONa group functions as a basic site. Excess sodium cations are agglomerated to form sodium hydroxides or carbonates, which act as basic sites. They would be present as microparticles on the catalyst due to not being detected by XRD. In the P-ZrO2, the H3PO4 loading (1.5mol%) is calculated to be 123μmolg−1, which corresponds to the difference in the basic sites between pure monoclinic and P-ZrO2. This indicates that the loaded H3PO4 neutralizes the surface basic site as a monovalent acid. Therefore, residual basic sites are still present on the P-ZrO2, which is clarified in the TPD experiment of adsorbed CO2 (Table 2). Parida and Pattnayak studied on the effect of H3PO4 on textural and acidic properties of ZrO2 [30]. The addition of H3PO4 caused a phase transition from monoclinic into tetragonal even at 2.24wt.% of PO4 3− (2.8mol%). In our study, however, the phase transition was not observed at 1.5mol% loading. The addition of PO4 3− with a concentration up to 15.7wt.% increased the number of acidic sites and the specific surface area [30]. Second components caused the enhancement of specific surface area of ZrO2 and they strongly influence the crystal structure [31]. 4.2 Formation of THF and γ-butyrolactone It is well known that 1,4-butanediol is selectively dehydrated into THF over strong acid catalysts [1,6,7]. THF is selectively produced in the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol over Al2O3 [1], which has strong acidic sites on the surface together with basic sites (Fig. 4). Baba and Ono reported that the formation rate of THF was proportional to the concentration of proton in the liquid-phase dehydrative cyclization of 1,4-butanediol with heteropoly acid [7]. Generally, acidity of protonic acids is weakened by solvation with water: the formation rate of THF decreased by hydration of the protons with water [7], and water inhibited the reaction because of strong adsorption of water on active acidic sites of acidic resin [6]. THF is predominantly produced over P-ZrO2 (Table 1). Large amount of acidic sites with the strength equivalent to the unmodified monoclinic ZrO2 contributes the selective production of THF. Although weak acidic sites of ZrO2 are related to the formation of THF from 1,4-butanediol (Fig. 5A), THF is produced even over Na-ZrO2 without acidic sites, on which NH3 gas can be adsorbed at 100°C. In addition, CeO2 has only weak basic sites on its surface without acidic sites (Fig. 4), which is consistent with the previous study [26]. The density of weak basic sites on CeO2, 2.54μmolm−2, which is calculated by dividing the number of basic sites (50.7μmolg−1) by its specific surface area (20.0m2 g−1), is in good agreement with 2.1–2.6μmolm−2 of CeO2 reported in the previous study. A small amount of THF is produced in the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol over the non-acidic CeO2 [1]. In this sense, THF is readily formed even over very weak acidic surface. Basic sites have an ability to dehydrogenate alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds. It was reported that alkali earth catalysts, such as Rb/Al2O3 and Sr/Al2O3, catalyzed the dehydrogenation of 2-propanol into propanone, which was well adopted to evaluate the basicity of catalysts [32,33]. 1-Propanol and 2-propanol were dehydrogenated into propanal and propanone, respectively, over Zn–Mica due to a preference for its basicity more than acidity [34]. In the dehydrogenative cyclization of 1,4-butanediol over copper-based catalyst at 240°C, γ-butyrolactone was selectively produced via two-step dehydrogenation [35]: one is the dehydrogenation of 1,4-butanediol to 4-hydroxybutanal and the other is the dehydrogenation of 2-hydroxytetrahydrofuran, which is the hemiacetal of 4-hydroxybutanal, to γ-butyrolactone. Since the selectivity to γ-butyrolactone increases with increasing the number of basic sites (Fig. 5B), γ-butyrolactone is probably formed through the dehydrogenative cyclization of 1,4-butanediol on basic sites of ZrO2. 4.3 Relationship between acid–base property and the selectivity to 3-buten-1-ol We have already reported that 3-buten-1-ol can be formed from 1,4-butanediol over pure CeO2 at high temperatures of 400–425°C [1]. CeO2 shows specific catalytic activity in some reactions, such as dehydration of 1,3-diols into allylic alcohols [2–4], ortho-selective alkylation of phenol with alcohols [26,36,37], and ketonization of alcohol [37,38], aldehyde, ester [39], and carboxylic acid [40]. We explained the catalyses of CeO2 through redox mechanism [3,4,26,37]. We speculate that 3-buten-1-ol is also formed over pure CeO2 via redox mechanism, not through acid–base catalysis. In the review of Tanabe and Yamaguchi [27], acid–base bifunctional catalyses over ZrO2 are introduced: orientation of acid–base pair sites is vitally important for the bifunctional catalysis. In the dehydration of 2-butanol, ZrO2 dominantly catalyzes the formation of 1-butene [11]. Over the ZrO2, both H+ of terminal methyl group and OH− are simultaneously abstracted from 2-butanol to form 1-butene. Both acidic and basic sites on ZrO2 concertedly play a role of catalysis, which is confirmed by poisoning tests with n-butylamine. It is proposed that acidic and basic sites on the catalyst interacted with OH group and β-hydrogen, respectively, to form alkenes [27]. Analogously, we speculate that simultaneous abstraction of β-hydrogen and OH group is necessary for the formation of 3-buten-1-ol in the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol over ZrO2 without cyclization into THF. In the present study, the selectivity to 3-buten-1-ol is maximized at the Na content of 1.5mol% (Fig. 1). The change in the selectivity to 3-buten-1-ol cannot be explained by either monotonical increase in the basic sites or decrease in the acidic sites (Fig. 5). Since the acidic sites disappeared at Na content of 1.0mol%, the acidic sites did not seem to be concerned with the dehydration. However, much weaker acidic sites, of which strength can be estimated by adsorption of NH3 at temperatures below 100°C, could contribute the dehydration as an adsorption site for OH group. The densities of acidic and basic sites of unmodified monoclinic ZrO2 are larger than those of tetragonal one (Table 2). This indicates that acidic and basic sites are located closely on the monoclinic ZrO2, whereas they are separated on the tetragonal one. The high densities present much more acid–base pair sites on the monoclinic ZrO2. Tetragonal ZrO2 with less acid–base pair sites catalyzes the cyclization of 1,4-butanediol into THF, while monoclinic one with more acid–base pair sites catalyzes the dehydration into 3-buten-1-ol. It is probable that the selectivity in the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol is reflected by the difference in the number of acid–base pair sites. 5 Conclusions Catalytic activities of sodium-modified monoclinic ZrO2 for the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol into 3-buten-1-ol were investigated at 325–375°C. The selectivity to 3-buten-1-ol of the original monoclinic ZrO2 was enhanced by the modification with sodium hydroxide, whereas the formation of THF was suppressed. The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments of adsorbed NH3 and CO2 were performed to evaluate the acidity and basicity of catalysts, respectively. It was confirmed that both acidic and basic sites were present on monoclinic ZrO2. Modification with sodium hydroxide onto ZrO2 led to decrease in the acidic sites, whereas led to increase in the basic sites. In the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol over sodium-modified ZrO2 at 325°C, the selectivity to products varied with the amount of sodium hydroxide modified. The selectivity to THF steeply decreased with decreasing acidic sites, whereas that to γ-butyrolactone increased as basic sites increase. In contrast, both acidic and basic sites cooperatively catalyze the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol into 3-buten-1-ol over monoclinic ZrO2.

        "dc:description": "Dehydration of 1,4-butanediol was investigated over ZrO2 at temperatures of 325–375°C. Modification of ZrO2 with a small amount of sodium hydroxide greatly enhanced the selectivity to 3-buten-1-ol. Temperature-programmed desorption of adsorbed NH3 and CO2 elucidated acidity and basicity of the catalysts, respectively. The number of acidic sites on the ZrO2 decreased with increasing Na content, and disappeared at Na content of 1.0mol%, whereas the number of basic sites increased with increasing Na content. In the relationship between Na content and the selectivity to products, selectivities to tetrahydrofuran and γ-butyrolactone simply increased with the number of acidic and basic sites, respectively. However, the selectivity to 3-buten-1-ol was maximized at an appropriate Na content. 3-Butan-1-ol is possibly formed by acid–base-concerted catalysis of monoclinic ZrO2 in the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol.",
