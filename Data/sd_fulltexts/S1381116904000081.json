Graphic Linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) with different branching contents were prepared from ethylene, without the addition of α-olefin comonomer, using a combination of catalyst precursors {TpMs}NiCl (1) (TpMs = hydridotris(3-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)) and Cp2ZrCl2 (2) activated with MAO/TMA (1:1) in toluene at 0°C and by varying the nickel loading mole fraction (x Ni). The polymerization results showed that the turnover frequencies are strongly dependent on the x Ni varying from 6.6×103 to 32.1×103 mol[C2H4]/mol[Zr]h. The 13 C NMR spectra of the copolymers showed that the branch contents of the polymers increase as the x Ni increase in the medium promoting the production of polymers with a wide range of melting point (T m). Keywords LLDPE Ethylene copolymerization Nickel and zirconocenes catalysts Tandem catalyst system 1 Introduction The synthesis of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) is a matter of both technical and academic interest [1]. Typically, LLDPE is produced when ethylene is copolymerized with an α-olefin such as 1-butene or 1-hexene utilizing conventional heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta and metallocene catalysts [2]. One of the most important limitations of the current processes for LLDPE production is the cost of the α-olefin used as comonomer. However, an alternative method that has recently received attention consists in the use of a binary system where one catalyst produces 1-alkenes in situ and the another one polymerizes ethylene and incorporates the 1-alkene into the growing chain [3]. This process has the main advantage of requiring only ethylene as a monomer. Early studies in this field developed by Komon and Bazan [4] involves the use of homogeneous binary catalyst system comprising {[(η5-C5Me4)SiMe2(η1-NCMe3)]TiMe}{MeB(C6F5)3}/[(C6H5)2-PC6H4C(OB(C6F5)3)O-κ2-P,O]Ni(η3-CH2C6H5). More recently, Marks and co-workers introduced a novel binary catalyst system comprising [(η5-3-ethylindenyl)Me2Si(η1-NCMe3)]ZrMe2 and [(η5-C5Me4)Me2Si(η1-NCMe3)]TiMe2 activated by a binuclear activator [5]. In the recent years, we have been interested in the development of the homogeneous binary catalyst systems aiming at produce polymeric materials with interesting properties [6]. Our initial studies have revealed that the turnover frequency (TOF) as well as the properties of the polymer are strongly influenced by the polymerization parameters such as metal mole fraction, solvent, cocatalyst, and temperature of polymerization. Herein, we report the combination of TpMsNiCl [TpMs = HB(3-mesityl-pyrazolyl)3 −], which is highly selective ethylene oligomerization catalyst [7], with standard metallocene Cp2ZrCl2, that copolymerizes ethylene with an α-olefin, in order to produce linear polyethylene with short chain branches. The branching content on the copolymer varies with the mole fraction of nickel (x Ni) 1 x Ni is defined as the nickel mole fraction calculated from [Ni]/([Ni] + [Zr]). 1 in the catalyst mixture. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials TpMsNiCl (1) was synthesized following procedures described in the literature [7]. Cp2ZrCl2 (2) was purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Ethylene, provided by White Martins Company, and argon were deoxygenated and dried through columns of BTS (BASF) and activated molecular sieves (3Å) prior to use. Methylaluminoxane (MAO) (Witco, 5.21wt.% Al, in toluene, average molar mass 900gmol−1) and trimethyl aluminum (TMA) (Aldrich, solution 10wt.% in hexane) were used as received. Toluene was refluxed and distilled over sodium diphenylketyl complex prior to use. 2.2 Polymerization procedures All polymerization reactions were performed in a double-walled glass reactor (120ml) equipped with magnetic stirring, thermocouple temperature control, and a continuous ethylene feed (1.1atm). Under an argon atmosphere the proper amounts of toluene and MAO/TMA solution were introduced sequentially, and then the system was saturated with ethylene. After complete saturation with ethylene at atmospheric pressure and thermal equilibration of the system, the polymerization reactions were started by adding solutions of 1 and/or 2 to the reactor. The total volume of the reaction mixtures was 60ml for all polymerizations. The polymerizations are quenched with acetone, filtered and the polymer washed with acidic ethanol, then water and ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven at 40°C for 12h. On the basis of the results of multiple runs, we estimate the accuracy of the productivities to ±8%. 2.3 Polymer characterization Melting temperatures were determined by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with a thermal analysis instruments DSC-2010 using a heating rate of 10°C/min after twice previous heating to 190°C and cooling to 40°C at 10°C/min. The molecular weight (M w) was evaluated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with the waters 150CV system equipped with three columns Styragel HT3, HT4, and HT6 (103,104, and 106 Å, respectively) and a refractive index detector. Analyses were undertaken using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as solvent (with 0.5g/l of Irganox 10/10 as antioxidant) at 140°C and the M w were calculated using a universal calibration curve built with polystyrene standards (American Polymer Standard Corporation) and checked with polyethylene and polypropylene known samples. The ethyl and butyl branch content in the LLDPE samples were determined by NMR spectroscopy. The 13 C NMR spectra were obtained with a Varian Inova 300 spectrometer operating at 75MHz and at 90°C, with a 71.7° flip angle, an acquisition time of 1.5s and delay of 4.0s. Samples solutions of the polymer were prepared in o-dichlorobenzene and benzene-d6 (20vol.%) in a 5mm NMR tube. 3 Results and discussion The ethylene polymerization (or oligomerization) reactions were carried out using TpMsNiCl (1) and Cp2ZrCl2 (2) (Plate 1 ) in toluene at 0°C using a mixture of MAO/TMA (1:1) as cocatalyst. Table 1 shows the results of polymerization runs by varying the nickel loading mole fraction (x Ni). Previously studies have demonstrated that 1 shows high selectivity in 1-butene (dimers: 86%; 1-butene: 78%) with turnover frequency of 5.4×103 h−1 for ethylene oligomerization reactions performed in toluene at 0°C in the presence of a mixture of MAO/TMA (1:1). Under identical polymerization conditions 2 showed turnover frequency of 7.9×103 mol[C2H4]/mol[Zr]h, and produced linear high density polyethylene. In order to produce branched polyethylene, we carried out the polymerization of ethylene using the combination of 1 and 2 under identical polymerization conditions studied for the systems employing the catalysts separately. Table 1 shows the data concerning to the performance of this catalytic system. Polymerization runs carried out varying x Ni showed that the turnover frequencies are strongly dependent on this parameter, varying from 6.6×103 to 32.1×103 mol[C2H4]/mol[Zr]h. Scheme 1 shows a plausible tandem catalytic mechanism using a combination of 1 and 2. The mechanism is composed by two complementary catalytic cycles characterized by ethylene dimerization, and the copolymerization process. In the first cycle, we assumed that the active species is a neutral TpMsNiH complex that promotes the production of 1-butene via β-hydrogen elimination in a similar way described by the nickel oligomerization catalysts [8]. Once the 1-alkene has been generated the copolymerization reaction takes place by insertion of 1-butene into the growing polyethylene chain (P) at the Cp2Zr(P)+ catalytic specie. The influence of x Ni and temperature on copolymer properties have been evaluated by means of differential scanning calorimetry, gel permeation chromatography, and 13 C NMR spectroscopy. The results are summarized in Table 1. The GPC results show that the molecular weight (M w) of the polymers is dependent on x Ni. In all cases the GPC curves displayed monomodal molecular weight distributions with polydispersities varying from 2.2 to 5.5. The homopolymer made by 2 showed molecular weight of 570×103 gmol−1. On the other hand, as the x Ni increases in the medium, the M w is reduced gradually reaching a lowest value for x Ni=0.80 (entry 4, 226×103 gmol−1). Furthermore, no significant changes on M w were observed for higher nickel mole fraction (x Ni≥0.90) as can be seen comparing entrys 4–6. The polyethylene produced using exclusively 2 showed melting temperature (T m) of 138°C and crystallinity of 37%. Conversely, the use of x Ni as high as 0.98 (entry 6) produced copolymer with T m of 98°C. It should be pointed out that the presence of x Ni up to 0.20 yielded copolymers with broad melting transitions suggesting the formation of copolymers with different fractions of comonomer/short chain branches (Fig. 1 ). In the specific case of x Ni=0.98, it was observed the formation of copolymer with three melting peaks. The melting temperatures of the copolymers obtained with increasing the nickel content decrease almost linearly as the 1-butene and 1-hexene incorporation increases as displayed in Fig. 2 . It is well-known that due to short chain branches, copolymers have a lower melting point than the ethylene homopolymer [9]. When the amount of short chain branches increases, the melting point decreases due to the decrease of CH2 crystallizable segments. Crystallization of such a polymer is determined to a major extent, if not completely, by the comonomer distribution along and among the chains. The 13 C NMR spectra of the copolymers (Fig. 3 ) show the presence of branches due to the 1-butene and 1-hexene incorporation in the polymer chain [4a,10]. In these samples, it was observed one peak at 30.0ppm, which is characteristic for the linear chain (CH2) n , and peaks at 11.1, 26.5, 30.5, 33.8, and 39.4ppm, attributed to the presence of ethyl branches, besides the incidence of much smaller signals corresponding to the butyl branches. The simplicity of polymer structure allows for the percentage of ethyl and butyl branches in the polymer to be determined and as shown in Fig. 2, the percent of 1-butene/1-hexene in the polymer correlates well against the x Ni. For instance, the number of branches per thousand backbone carbon atoms increases from 12.5 to 26.8 as the nickel mole fraction increases from 0.50 to 0.98. In summary, we have development a novel homogeneous binary catalyst system able to produce linear low density polyethylene using only ethylene as feedstock. The turnover frequencies as well as the polymer properties are depend on x Ni. Higher activities were reached using high nickel mole fraction. The melting points of the copolymers and the branching contents show a linear correlation with respect to x Ni. Further investigations into the reactivity of this catalytic system will be the subject of a future report.
