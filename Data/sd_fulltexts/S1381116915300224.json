Graphical abstract A template-free method was employed to synthesize cobalt catalysts embedded in N-doped carbon (Co–N–C) through heating cobalt(II) meso-tetraphenyl porphyrin (CoTPP) precursor at different temperature (600°C, 700°C, 800°C). These catalysts were characterized by techniques such as BET, TG-DTA, TEM, STEM, XRD, Raman and XPS. The selective oxidation of ethylbenzene under solvent-free condition with molecular oxygen was carried out to explore the catalytic performance of Co–N–C. 13.4% conversion of ethylbenzene with 73.3% selectivity to acetophenone was achieved over Co–N–C and the catalytic performance of the catalyst was similar to the fresh even after six runs (i.e., 12.5% of ethylbenzene conversion and 72.2% of selectivity to acetophenone). The results show that the stable catalytic performance of the catalysts may be attributed to the stable N-doped graphitic carbon, the stability of carbon-encapsulated Co nanoparticles and the synergistic effect between N–C structure and cobalt oxide. Keywords N-doped carbon One-pot method Cobalt porphyrin Synergistic effect Selective oxidation of ethylbenzene 1 Introduction Traditional carbon materials, such as activated carbon, carbon black, and many nano-carbon materials like carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, and graphene are not only employed as supports in heterogeneous catalysis [1,2] but also utilized as catalysts in many catalytic reactions, including the selective oxidation of benzene [3] and the reduction of nitrobenzene [4]. In these catalytic systems, it was observed that doping with heteroatoms such as N [5,6], B [7,8], P [8], S [9] could improve the catalytic activity of the carbon materials. Among these, N-doped carbon materials have attracted much interest due to their unexpected catalytic performances. There are three common bonding configurations of N when a nitrogen atom is framed within a carbon lattice, i.e., quaternary (or graphitic), pyridinic and pyrrolic [10]. The spin density and the charge distribution of the carbon atoms in a given N-doped carbon framework are influenced by the neighbor nitrogen dopants, which induce activated regions on the surface [11]. Besides, Yu et al. [12] reported that N-doping could increase the zigzag edges/defects of carbon materials which may act as catalytic active sites to the reaction. Xu et al. [6] prepared microporous graphitic carbon nitride material for Knoevenagel reactions which can be used readily without any assisted reaction condition or catalyst pretreatment. Ma et al. [13] synthesized N-doped partially graphitic mesoporous carbon for nitrobenzene reduction which shows excellent catalytic performance for nitrobenzene reduction reaction with 88.6% yield to aniline. Transition metal (Co, Fe, Mn)–nitrogen–carbon hybrids, which are regarded as low-cost, efficient and durable alternatives for the replacement of Pt-based electrocatalysts, have attracted intensive research interests in last decades. However, most of the applications of M–N–C catalysts are focused on the oxygen reduction reaction [14,15] or oxygen evolution reaction [16] in which M–N–C catalysts show almost no catalytic effect on methanol. Metalloporphyrins are well known for their high performance in many biological functions because they can be employed to mimic natural enzymes as active reaction sites [17]. However, the direct application of metalloporphyrin has encountered great challenge due to the difficult recovery and easy degradation caused by self-destruction [18]. Heat treatment of metalloporphyrins has been proved to be an effective approach to enhance the catalytic performance as well as improve the recyclability [19]. Therefore, with unique carbon-rich macrocycle and inherent metal-nitrogen coordination, metalloporphyrins, especially cobalt porphyrin, iron porphyrin, and manganese porphyrin, are attractive precursors for one-step synthesis of M–N–C catalysts. What's more, catalytic performance of M–N–C catalysts in selective oxidation of arylalkanes has been explored. In our previous work, Liu et al. [19] reported that Co–N–C/SiO2, which was prepared through heating of supported cobalt(II) 5-(4-carboxyphenyl)-10,15,20-triphenyl porphyrin, exhibited high catalytic performance for ethylbenzene oxidation. Moreover, the influence of heat treatment on catalytic performance of Co–N–C/SiO2 has been explored. However, the catalytic activity decreased sharply after the first run of use which may be attributed to the easy decomposition of active sites such as Co–N4–C at oxidation atmosphere [20]. In order to improve the stability of the Co–N–C catalysts, herein, we synthesized cobalt catalysts embedded in N-doped carbon through the pyrolysis of cobalt(II) meso-tetraphenyl porphyrin. Herein, N–C is designed to not only prevent the growth of Co particles but also stabilize Co valence via the ability of N–C in donating and accepting electrons. Techniques such as BET, TG-DTA, TEM, STEM, XRD, Raman and XPS are employed to investigate their physicochemical properties. Furthermore, the selective oxidation of ethylbenzene under solvent-free condition with molecular oxygen as oxidant is carried out to investigate the catalytic performance of Co–N–C catalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of catalysts The compound cobalt(II) meso-tetraphenyl porphyrin (CoTPP) was synthesized according to the literature [21]. Typically, distilled pyrrole (4.69g, 70.0mmol) was added dropwise into a three-neck flask containing a mixture of propanoic acid (250mL), benzaldehyde (5.56g, 52.5mmol) and 4-carboxy benzaldehyde (2.62g, 17.5mmol), and then heated to reflux for 1h. The obtained product was cooled overnight, then filtered and purified. meso-Tetraphenyl porphyrin was obtained. 1.0g (1.6mmol) of the as-synthesized sample was dissolved in 100mL N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). After loading 2.5g (10.5mmol) of CoCl2·6H2O in batches, the mixture was heated to reflux under stirring until meso-triphenyl porphyrin was exhausted. Cooling overnight, the achieved mixture was filtered and washed repeatedly with deionized water, and the product cobalt(II) meso-tetraphenyl porphyrin, denoted as CoTPP, was yielded. CoTPP was loaded in a quartz boat and pyrolyzed at different temperatures (namely, 600°C, 700°C and 800°C) in nitrogen atmosphere with the heating rate of 10°C/min. The resulting cobalt-nitrogen doped carbons were denoted as Co–N–C-600, Co–N–C-700 and Co–N–C-800. N–C-800 and CoO x -800, derived from meso-tetraphenyl porphyrin and CoCl2·6H2O, respectively, were prepared for comparison. Co/N–C-800, prepared by impreganation method and Co–N–C/SiO2-800, with silica as support, were synthesized for comparison as well. 2.2 Catalysts characterizations Surface area was measured by nitrogen adsorption/desorption at 77K on a NOVA 1000e apparatus from Quantachrome Instruments. The samples were degassed at 300°C for 3h prior to the adsorption experiments. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) models were used to determine the specific surface areas, pore volume, and pore sizes of the samples, respectively. TG-DTA of the sample was carried out on a Shimadzu DTG-60(H) thermogravimetric analyzer, and the sample was heated from 20°C to 850°C at 10°C/min in N2 atmosphere with flowing rate of 30mL/min. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were obtained on a JEM-3010 high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 200kV. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images were recorded on Titan G2 60-300 with image corrector operating at 300kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with a powder X-ray diffractometer D8-Advance (Bruker AXS, Germany). Raman measurements were performed under ambient conditions using a 532nm (2.33eV) laser in the back-scattering configuration on a Mono Vista 2560 spectrometer from Princeton Instruments. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were evaluated on a RBD upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (Perkin Elmer) with Mg Kα radiation (hν=1253.6eV) or Al Kα radiation (hν=1486.6eV). The obtained binding energies were calibrated using the C 1s peak at 284.6eV as reference. 2.3 Catalytic performance test The selective oxidation of ethylbenzene with molecular oxygen as oxidant was conducted in a 50mL autoclave. 10mL of ethylbenzene and 30mg catalyst were loaded in the reactor and then sealed and raised pressure to 0.8MPa with O2. Following that, temperature was elevated to 120°C and kept for 5h. The products were analyzed by gas chromatography gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014 equipped with a capillary column (RTX-5)) using a flame ionization detector with internal standard method using bromobenzene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene as reference. The recovered catalyst was obtained by centrifugation, then washed with ethanol and dried at 80°C in air. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 BET N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution curves of Co–N–C-800 are shown in Fig. 1 . As shown in Fig. 1, the amount of absorbed N2 increases/decreases monotonically at a high P/P 0 (P/P 0 >0.9) without an adsorption limit for Co–N–C-800. According to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry classification, the N2 sorption isotherms of Co–N–C-800 belong to type IV shape which indicates the presence of mesopores. There is a relatively large adsorption–desorption hysteresis loop of H3 type at a relative pressure above 0.4, which is because of the capillary condensation of N2 in the slit-shaped nanopores [22]. The BJH pore size distribution illustrates that mesopores are non-uniform and the content is low when the pyrolysis temperature is 600°C. However, when the temperature rises to 700°C and 800°C, pore diameters are uniform and mainly distributed around 3.7nm (Table 1 ). It is worth noting that the specific surface area and total volume tend to increase with the elevated temperature. 3.1.2 TG-DTA TG-DTA analysis is conducted to further investigate the structure evolution of Co–N–C with increasing temperature (Fig. 2 ). Despite decades of work in this field, there is still not fully understood about this process. Initially, CoTPP losses crystal water at around 95°C and shows mass loss up to 8% as shown by broad endothermic peak given in Fig. 2. Further, it presents total mass loss up to 68% as measured according to the TG curve. The DTA curve shows four decomposition temperatures at 445, 482, 545 and 738°C, respectively, which indicates that CoTPP decomposes in four stages [23] and the different stages are associated to the sequential thermal degradation of the porphyrin macrocycles [24]. These exothermic peaks may be because of detachment of phenyl rings from pyrole rings, rupture and detachment of cobalt from pyrole rings, cleavage of phenyl rings and the decomposition of remaining organic fragments. Finally, Co–N–C structure, i.e., N-doped carbon with Co embedded in, comes into formation. 3.1.3 TEM The morphology and structure of the Co–N–C composites pyrolyzed under different temperatures (600°C, 700°C and 800°C) are examined by transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images as presented in Fig. 3 . As shown in Fig. 3a, the TEM image of Co–N–C-600 shows that Co nanoparticles (6nm) are embedded in a flat sheet-like structure which is composed of amorphous carbon (Fig. 3d). As for Co–N–C-700, the structure is twisted and spiral, which features ringed graphitic layers is formed (Fig. 3b and e). As the temperature increases to 800°C (Fig. 3c and f), little change in the overall structure of Co–N–C-800 is observed compared to Co–N–C-700. Evidently, graphite carbon and amorphous carbon are coexisted in Co–N–C-700 and Co–N–C-800. It can be clearly seen that the graphitic spiral structures are not found at 600°C but appear at 700°C and 800°C. This phenomenon reveals that the generation of graphitic structures is heavily dependent on pyrolysis temperature. In addition, cobalt nanoparticles can be seen obviously in TEM images of 600°C, 700°C and 800°C. Their particle sizes follow the order: 6nm (600°C)<20nm (700°C)<43nm (800°C), which shows that the particle sizes of cobalt nanoparticles become larger with the increasing of treating temperatures. It can be concluded that high temperature may cause the aggregation of cobalt nanoparticles. It is worth noting that cobalt nanoparticle is embedded in N-doped carbon architecture and surrounded by a few graphitic carbon layers (Fig. 3g), which is favorable to the stability of catalysts [25]. STEM is carried out to further demonstrate the element distribution in Co–N–C structures with Co–N–C-800 as the example (Fig. 3h and i). The elemental mapping analysis of Co–N–C-800 (Fig. 3i) suggests the presence of Co, C, N, and O components in the product and the cobalt signal along with oxygen which indicates the existence of cobalt oxides. It has been reported that when exposed to air under ambient conditions, the top surface layers of Co can be easily oxidized by oxygen [26]. Therefore, we argue that the metallic Co first forms during the pyrolysis process and then is oxidized when exposed to air. 3.1.4 XRD Fig. 4 presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Co–N–C-600, Co–N–C-700 and Co–N–C-800. The wide and weak diffraction peaks at 26° and 43° are ascribed to the (002) and (100) plane of carbon. Relatively higher peak intensity of Co–N–C-700 and Co–N–C-800 indicates a higher graphitization degree [27]. The Co–N–C-700 and Co–N–C-800 display well defined peaks corresponding to JCPDS card 43-1003, which suggests the existing of Co3O4. The XRD patterns of Co–N–C-700 and Co–N–C-800 include three characteristic peaks at approximately 44.3°, 51.6°, and 75.8°, which are attributed to metallic cobalt. However, peaks of Co3O4 and metallic cobalt have not been detected in XRD patterns of Co–N–C-600 which is probably due to the small size of cobalt nanoparticles and high dispersion in nitrogen-doped carbon [27]. As temperature increases, small nanoparticles tend to sinter to grow up and exposed to be more detectable. 3.1.5 Raman Raman spectroscopy is used to illustrate the graphitization process and chemical bonding state of pyrolyzed CoTPP. All these Co–N–C materials have an obvious D band at 1338cm−1 which is associated with defects, and a G band at 1567cm−1 which is corresponding to graphitic carbon (Fig. 5 ) [5]. All of the spectra exhibit very weak peaks at about 452cm−1, 499cm−1, 595cm−1, and 662cm−1, corresponding respectively to the Eg, F2 2g, F3 2g, and A1g modes of surface dispersed cobalt oxide [28]. In particular, the broad Raman band near 600cm−1 is characteristic of dispersed cobalt oxide species (i.e., CoO), as reported in literature [29,30]. Increasing of I(D) and I(G) with rising temperature reveals the enhanced graphitization degree of Co–N–C. The increased I(D)/I(G) with the rising temperature (Table 2 ) indicates that the graphitization degree of carbon in the Co–N–C samples increases with the elevated pyrolysis temperature. Among all these Co–N–C materials, Co–N–C-800 possesses the highest I(D)/I(G) indicating that this sample has the highest graphitization degree which may simultaneously produce more defects than the other samples [31]. Because of rupture of N-doped carbon skeleton of CoTPP, the N-doped mesoporous graphitic structure shows a gradual overlap of the D and G bands [32]. The overlap is most obvious for the sample Co–N–C-800 due to the further decomposition degree. The changing trends of the Raman spectra agreed with the conclusion of the TEM images and XRD analysis. 3.1.6 XPS The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis is performed to gain further information on surface compositions and surface chemical states of the catalysts (Fig. 6 ). The full XPS spectrum of Co–N–C catalysts is presented in Fig. 6a. Co, C, N, and O elements can be found in the products, in consistent with the elemental mapping results (Fig. 3i). Among the surface composition in Co–N–C as depicted in Table 3 , the content of C is the largest part. Moreover, with the heat temperature increases, the content of C in Co–N–C increases. Apparently, heat is beneficial to produce more carbon [20]. The content of N follows the same trend with C while O follows the opposite one. In the meantime, the content of Co increases slightly from 0.74% (600°C) to 0.86% (700°C) and remains similar with 800°C (0.84%). The C 1s spectrum is fitted according to the following carbon bonding environments: 284.6eV (CC), 285.7eV (CN), and 286.6eV (CN) (Fig. 6b), which suggests the successfully doping of N atoms in Co–N–C catalysts [33]. The high-resolution N1s peaks in Co–N–C catalysts are shown in Fig. 6c. The N 1s XPS spectrum can be deconvoluted into three peaks: pyridinic N (398.6eV), pyrrolic N (399.8eV) and graphitic N (401.3eV), respectively [34]. In the cobalt region (Fig. 6d), the band around 778.5eV is attributed to CoO [25]. Besides, peaks characteristic for oxidic Co with the typical binding energy of 780.2eV of the Co 2p3/2 and 796.2eV of the Co 2p1/2 electrons are also found. Generally, most cobalt oxides and hydroxides (e.g., CoO, Co2O3, Co3O4 and CoOOH) have similar values. It is difficult to determine the oxidation states of cobalt cations merely through Co 2p main lines. Therefore, satellite peak information should be considered [35–39]. The weak shake-up satellite peaks at 784.9eV and 802.0eV suggest that the oxidic Co is mainly composed of Co3O4 [39], agreeing with the XRD and Raman results. The low energy bands can be deconvoluted into two peaks with the binding energies of 781.2eV and 779.6eV which represent Co2+ and Co3+, respectively [40]. This agrees very well with TEM results, which means that the very small particles are oxidic and the bigger particles contain a Co core and a cobalt oxide shell. In the literature [41], it is discussed that CoO on the surface is not stable and therefore oxidized to Co3O4. Thus, it can be concluded that the surface of all Co-containing particles in the catalyst consists of Co3O4 while CoO and Co (reflected by XRD) might be enriched in the bulk. All of these above observations manifest that Co–N–C catalysts with cobalt nanoparticles embedded in high specific surface area N-C structure have been prepared successfully through annealing of cobalt(II) meso-tetraphenyl porphyrin (CoTPP). 3.2 Activity measurement The selective oxidation of ethylbenzene is chosen as the probe reaction to measure the catalytic performance of as prepared Co–N–C. The catalytic performances of catalysts estimated by TON of cobalt are listed in Table 4 . From Table 4 (Entries 1–3), we can see that Co–N–C-800 show slightly higher conversions of ethylbenzene and selectivity to acetophenone for ethylbenzene oxidation compared with Co–N–C-600 and Co–N–C-700. The TON exhibits the same order with conversion of ethylbenzene which illustrates that Co–N–C-800 possesses better catalytic activity. In the reported literature, probably attributed to the fact that the redox potential of Co3+/Co2+ (1.808V) is more positive than that of the other metals, the amount of Co3+ on the surface of cobalt oxides has a positive influence in catalytic activity [42,43]. Therefore we conclude that the similar oxidation results may be attributed to the similar content of Co and ratio of Co3+/Co2+ in these Co–N–C catalysts. The ratio of Co3+/Co2+ of Co–N–C catalysts is shown in Table 5 . What's more, the ethylbenzene conversion of Co–N–C-800 is a little higher than the others which may be ascribed to the larger specific surface area and more defects caused by graphitization from the analysis of BET and Raman results. In order to demonstrate the synergistic effect between N-C structure and cobalt oxide, taken Co–N–C-800 as representative, we compare the catalytic activity of Co–N–C-800, N–C–800, CoO x -800 and Co/N–C-800 (Table 4, Entries 3–6). Obviously, the ethylbenzene conversion of Co–N–C-800 (13.4%) is higher than that of N–C-800 (9.0%), CoO x -800 (9.6%), and Co/N–C-800 (9.8%) which means there is synergistic effect between N–C structure and cobalt oxide in Co–N–C-800 to some extent. Compared with SN mentioned in literature, N–C displayed higher ethylbenzene conversion (9.0%) and selectivity to acetophenone (73.0%) than SN (solid silica nanoparticles) [19], ethylbenzene conversion (3.5%) and selectivity to acetophenone (63.9%). And Co–N–C-800 showed higher catalytic activity than Co/SN as well which illustrates that the hydrophobic nature of supports may facilitate the reaction. In the reported literature [44], the hydrophobic carrier is beneficial to the adsorption of nonpolar substrate, ethylbenzene, and desorption of polar products of the reaction. However, the catalytic performance of Co–N–C-800 was not as good as catalysts Co–N–C with silica as support, i.e., Co–N–C/SN, Co–N–C/SiO2-800 (Table 4, Entry 9 and 10). This result was consistent with the phenomenon in literature [19]. That may be owing to the entrapped role of N–C structure on cobalt nanoparticles in Co–N–C as can be seen in TEM and HRTEM images listed above (Fig. 3c and g), which may hinder the contact between the substrate and cobalt nanoparticles while preventing the loss of cobalt nanoparticles. But catalysts Co–N–C with silica as support possess better exposure of cobalt nanoparticles [19]. The catalytic performances of Co–N–C-800 and Co–N–C/SiO2-800 under milder conditions, mainly at low temperature, were tested. As can be seen in Table 4 (Entry 11 and 12), the low conversion of ethylbenzene and selectivity of acetophenone reveal that the selective oxidation of ethylbenzene is difficult to react under relative low temperature even with the existence of Co–N–C catalysts. This suggests that the catalytic activities of Co–N–C catalysts under milder conditions remain to be improved. Additionally, in order to demonstrate the stability and reusability of the catalyst material, six consecutive oxidation experiments are performed (Fig. 7 ). After being reused up to 6 times, the catalytic performance of Co–N–C-800 has only slightly changed, which presents the Co–N–C structure is stable in the heterogeneous selective oxidation of ethylbenzene. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, we have demonstrated the synthesis of a novel mesoporous graphitic Co–N–C materials with high specific surface area and large pore volume derived from cobalt(II) meso-tetraphenyl porphyrin (CoTPP) via template-free approach, which can be expanded to produce metal or metal oxide nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon materials in one-step. The Co–N–C catalysts exhibit remarkable catalytic activity and in the solvent-free selective oxidation of ethylbenzene which may be ascribed to the stable N-doped graphitic carbon, the synergistic effect of N–C structure and cobalt oxide and the stability of carbon-encapsulated Co nanoparticles.

        "dc:description": "A template-free method was employed to synthesize cobalt catalysts embedded in N-doped carbon (Co–N–C) through heating cobalt(II) meso-tetraphenyl porphyrin (CoTPP) precursor at different temperature (600°C, 700°C, 800°C). These catalysts were characterized by techniques such as BET, TG-DTA, TEM, STEM, XRD, Raman and XPS. The selective oxidation of ethylbenzene under solvent-free condition with molecular oxygen was carried out to explore the catalytic performance of Co–N–C. 13.4% conversion of ethylbenzene with 73.3% selectivity to acetophenone was achieved over Co–N–C and the catalytic performance of the catalyst was similar to the fresh even after six runs (i.e., 12.5% of ethylbenzene conversion and 72.2% of selectivity to acetophenone). The results show that the stable catalytic performance of the catalysts may be attributed to the stable N-doped graphitic carbon, the stability of carbon-encapsulated Co nanoparticles and the synergistic effect between N–C structure and cobalt oxide.",
