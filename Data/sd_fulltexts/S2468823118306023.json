Graphical abstract Lithium doped TiO2 were prepared by simple impregnation, which was used as heterogeneous catalysts for the transesterification of DMC with BPA. The characterized results of FTIR, XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM and temperature programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD) showed that the structure and performance of the catalysts were obviously influenced by the doping amount of Li+ and calcining temperature. The optimum catalytic activity was obtained when the molar ratio of Ti/Li reached 6 and the calcination temperature came up to 400 ℃, which was due to Li+ reaction with TiO2 to form surface Ti-O-Li at 400 ℃ (Ti/Li-6-400). When the transesterification of DMC with BPA was carried out at 160–180 ℃ over Ti/Li-6-400, BPA conversion reached 46.67%, and the yields of one-methylcarbonate-ended-BPA (MmC(1)) and two-methylcarbonate-ended-BPA (DmC(1)) achieved 36.36% and 5.97%, respectively, and only 9.3% methylation selectivity was detected. In addition, the possible transesterification mechanism was provided. Keywords Bisphenol a Dimethyl carbonate Transesterification Li doped TiO2 1 Introduction Poly (bisphenol A carbonate) (PC) is usually prepared through interfacial polycondensation of phosgene and bisphenol A (BPA) [1], however, a large amount of dichloromethane is used as solvent and highly toxic phosgene acted as reaction reagent in this process, which results in serious environmental pollution. In order to avoid using this toxic reagent in PC synthesis, diphenyl carbonate (DPC) [1–7], CO [8–13], and DMC [14–17] are used as carbonylation agents to replace phosgene. As for DPC method, the byproduct phenol of the reaction DPC and BPA can only be removed in high temperature (higher than 300 ℃) and low vacuum (less than 13 Pa) [18]. PC also can be obtained by oxidative carbonylation of BPA and CO [9,19], generally the relative lower molecular mass of PC was synthesized by this method, which limits its commercialization process. It has been reported that BPA can react with DMC to form PC precursors (one-methylcarbonate-ended-BPA (MmC (1)) and two-methylcarbonate-ended-BPA (DmC (1)), and they subsequently polymerized to form high molecular weight PC [4,16,20]. DMC is completely qualified for a green reagent, and the by-product methanol after reaction can be easily removed at low temperature [21] ( Scheme 1 ). Therefore, the selective synthesis of DmC (1) (or MmC (1)) from BPA and DMC has become an interesting topic. The homogeneous catalysts such as Ph2SnO [22], (Bu2SnCl)2O [16], Bu2SnO and titanium alkoxides exhibited an outstanding catalytic activity in the transesterification of DMC with BPA, but it is difficult to separate and regenerate from the products. Therefore, the development of effective heterogeneous catalysts is of great significance for the synthesis of PC precursors by transesterification of DMC with BPA. Kim [23] prepared TiO2/SiO2 catalysts with small surface area by impregnation method, and the transesterification of DMC with BPA was carried out over them. The conversion of BPA was only 11% for 55 h at 160 ℃, and the yield of MmC(1) and DmC(1) was less than 11%. Su [24] grafted TiO2 on SBA-15 template to prepare heterogeneous catalyst with high specific surface area. The conversion of BPA reached 30.33% for 10 h at 160 ℃, and the yield of MmC(1) and DmC(1) were 25.3% and 3.6%, respectively. Although these heterogeneous catalysts could increase the conversion of BPA and the yield of MmC(1) or DmC(1). However, the conversion of BPA and the yield of MmC(1) or DmC(1) are still not satisfactory. Therefore, it is really necessary to develop some new catalysts to achieve higher activity and stability under mild operating conditions. It has been reported that lithium doped metal oxides such as Li/MgO [25], Li/ZnO [26–28], Li/CaO [29], Li/ZrO [30], Li/Al2O3 [31] show the excellent catalytic performance in the catalytic synthesis of biodiesel by transesterification. Most importantly, lithium doping TiO2 has been applied in many fields, such as perovskite solar cells [32], Lithium-Ion Battery [33], Nanosensors [34], photocatalytic [35,36]. However, the transesterification of DMC with BPA over Li/TiO2 have not been studied. In this work, lithium doped TiO2 was prepared by simple impregnation method, and the catalysts were used for the transesterification of DMC with BPA. The results showed that Li+ reacted with TiO2 to form surface Ti-O-Li species at 400 ℃, and the synthesized catalysts displayed the high catalytic activity in transesterification of BPA with DMC. In addition, the effects of lithium doping amount, calcination temperature and reusability of catalysts were investigated, and the possible reaction mechanism was provided. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemical reagents TiO2 powder was provided by Tianjin Chemical Reagent Co. Lithium nitrate (LiNO3) was obtained from Aladdin Corp. Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (99.9 wt%) was purchased from Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China. Analytical BPA was provided by Tianjin Chemical Reagent Company. Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, K90) was obtained from Tianjin Guangfu Chemical Co., Ltd. 2.2 Sample preparation Li-doped TiO2 catalysts were prepared by a simple wet impregnation method. To prepare Li doped TiO2 catalysts, 2 g Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) was dissolved in 100 mL water, after that 4.8 g ordinary grade TiO2 was added to the above solution by ultrasonic treatment for 60 min to obtain uniformly distributed suspension A. Then, 0.69 g lithium nitrate was loaded into suspension A, and it was aged for 24 h at room temperature to obtain suspension B. Then suspension B was transferred into a reactor with polytetrafluorine at 160 ℃ for 3 h. After cooling, lithium doped TiO2 was obtained. The lithium doped TiO2 catalyst was then calcined at different temperatures in muffle furnace for 4 h. The obtained catalyst was named as Ti/Li-n-T, where n and T were the molar ratio and calcination temperature, respectively. Such as, Ti/Li-6-400 indicated that Ti/Li molar ratio was 6 and calcined at 600 ℃. 2.3 Characterization X-ray diffraction Spectra of Catalysts measured by Cu K α radiation to Bruker AXS (Germany) with a scan range of 20-70° (2θ). FT-IR spectrum was obtained from the range of 4000–400 cm−1 wave numbers with resolution of 4 cm−1 a BRUKER FT-IR Analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis was measured by Setaram TGA-92 thermogravimetric analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and N2 flow of 90 mL/min. Gemini SEM500 high resolution scanning selection microscope working under 10 kV was obtained from ZEISS Inc. Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) were provided by a Hitachi instrument H-7650 with an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. The surface chemical information and elemental analysis of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with Mg kα (1253.6 e V) X-ray source from Thermo Fisher Company, USA. The basicity active site of the catalysts was characterized by CO2 Temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) using Micromeritics TPD/TPR 2900 apparatus. Typically, 200 mg of sample was pretreated by ﬂowing 35 mL/min He at 250 ℃ for 60 min to dry the catalysts, then, pretreated catalyst cooled to 100 ℃ and exposed to pure CO2 for 90 min. Subsequently, He (35 ml/min) was passed for 40 min at 100 ℃ to remove physically adsorbed CO2. The CO2-TPD measurement was performed from100 to 800 ℃ at a rate of 10 ℃/min. A thermal conductivity cell was used for recording the desorbed amount of CO2. 2.4 Reaction procedure Reactions were carried out in a three neck ﬂask, equipped with a thermometer, a controlled volume pump and fractionating column connected to a liquid dividing head. BPA and catalysts were charged into ﬂask under nitrogen atmosphere. When mixture was heated to 170 ℃ under rigorous stirring, DMC was added drop-wise by a controlled volume pump and the reaction temperature was kept at 160–180 °C under refluxing condition. During the reaction, the mixture of DMC and methanol was collected slowly in a receiver ﬂask. After reaction, mixture was cooled and analyzed by GC–MS. The products were mainly one-methylcarbonate-ended-BPA (MmC(1)) and two-methylcarbonate-ended-BPA (DmC(1)), O-methylation of BPA (A), fromortho-methylation of BPA with DMC (B and C). The selectivity of products to MmC(1) and DmC(1) were defined as the moles of MmC(1) and DmC(1) produced per 100 mol of consumed BPA, and the yields of MmC(1) and DmC(1) were obtained from multiplication of BPA conversion by the selectivity of products to MmC(1) and DmC(1) (Scheme 1).

A peak at 1640 cm−1 and a strong broad at 3400 cm−1 were ascribed to the H − O binding vibration. The intensity of these peaks became weaken with the increase of calcination temperature (Fig. 1b). The strong peaks at 500-800 cm−1 were attributed to Ti-O-Ti and Ti-O bonds. The absorption peaks at 1390 cm−1 was found in sample with calcination temperature at 300 ℃, which could be attributed to the stretching vibration peak of NO bond in LiNO3. However, the stretching vibration peak of NO bond disappeared while a new peak at 1512 cm−1 appeared together with the calcination temperature increase. Because the atomic mass of lithium was lower than titanium, peak at 1512 cm−1 may be assigned to framework Ti-O-Li vibration [37–39]. The XRD patterns of Li doped TiO2 with different Li contents calcined at 400 ℃ were showed in Fig. 2 a. It was found that all the catalysts exhibited anatase TiO2 (JCPDS Card NO. 21-1272). In order to prove that lithium was embedded in the lattice of TiO2, the XRD patterns of 2θ region at 24–27 ° were showed in Fig. 2b. Compared with pure TiO2, the (101) peak of Li doped TiO2 shifted to the lower 2θ degree with the increase of Li+ content. When the molar ratio of Ti/Li was lower than 4, the (101) peak position did not change with Li content increase. Based on these experimental results, we assume that lithium atoms can be embedded into TiO2 lattice which substitutes partial Ti atom to form Ti-O-Li structure. It was reported that TiO2 exhibited anatase and rutile crystalline phases at the calcination temperature of 400 and 600 ℃, respectively [40]. However, it could be observed that all the catalysts exhibited anatase TiO2 at different calcination temperatures as shown in Fig. 2c. In order to further study the effects of different temperatures on (101) crystal plane, the 24–27° XRD patterns were showed in Fig. 2d. Compared with pure TiO2, all (101) peak positions of Li doped TiO2 shifted to lower 2θ degree, which could be attributed to the reaction of Li+ with TiO2 to form Ti-O-Li. Although, there was no enough activated Li+ to reacted with surface TiO2 to form surface Ti-O-Li at low temperature, the activated Li+ could replace the Ti4+ inside of TiO2 to form the internal Ti-O-Li at high temperature. The surface Ti-O-Li was more likely to cause the 2θ shift of (101) than that of internal Ti-O-Li. Thus, the less obvious 2θ shift of these peaks could be observed at the higher calcination temperature. The XPS spectra for TiO2 and Ti/Li-6-400 sample were presented in Fig. 3 . XPS survey indicated the presence of O, Ti, N, Li, and a certain amount of C in all samples. For pure TiO2, the O 1S peaks at binding energies of 529.6 eV were assigned to Ti-O (Fig. 4 a). For Ti/Li-6-400 catalyst, the peak at 529.5 eV was also attributed to the Ti − O- band existence [41], and the peak at 531.6 eV was assigned to the oxygen interaction with the lithium (Li-O) [25,42,43]. However, the O 1 s peaks of Ti/Li-6-600 at 529.3 eV (Ti-O) and 531.3 eV (O-Li) were different from those of Ti/Li-6-400, implying the change of O chemical environment. As shown in Fig. 4b, two primary peaks at 458.3 eV and 464.1 eV were attributed to the characteristic Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks of TiO2. The ﬁtting peaks of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 in Ti/Li-6-400 at 458.2 eV, 458.6 eV and 463.6 eV, 464.5 eV could be ascribed to the change of Ti chemical environment and the occurrence of Ti and Li interaction. However, Ti 2p3/2 peaks of Ti/Li-6-600 declined to 458.1 eV and 458.5 eV, and Ti 2p1/2 increased to 463.7 eV and 464.7 eV. The Li 1 s peak could be observed in Fig. 4c. As the Li doping amount increase, the peak intensity of Li 1S raised. In according to the XPS spectra of O 1 s, Ti 2p and Li 1 s, it can be concluded that a large amount of Li+ was doped onto the surface of TiO2 to form the bond of Ti-O-Li at 400 ℃. However, as the calcination temperature increase to 600 ℃, the peak intensity of Li+ 1 s declined obviously, which indicated that some Li+ was embedded in the lattice of TiO2. The presence of C peaks could be attributed to the decomposition residue of PVP, resulting from the high temperature carbonation of PVP (Figs. 3 and 4d). When the calcination temperature was set at 300 ℃, the N 1 s peak at 399 eV was attributed to the NO3 −, but the peak of N 1 s disappeared with the increase of calcination temperature, which was agreement with the FTIR results. Fig. 5 a and b showed the SEM images of anatase TiO2 and Ti/Li-6-400 catalysts. The smooth cube or spherical morphology could be observed from the SEM and TEM image of anatase TiO2. However, the SEM and TEM image of Ti/Li-6-400 mainly showed the spherical shape (Fig. 5b and d), and the surface of Ti/Li-6-400 was coarser than that of pure TiO2. The average size of anatase TiO2 and Ti/Li-6-400 was about 100 nm. The surface of Ti/Li-6-400 greatly changed from smooth structure to coarse surface with much protuberance due to the reaction between Li+ and TiO2 [44], which was well agree with the result of XPS. The thermal stability of catalysts was characterized by TG in N2 atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 6 a, there was almost no weight loss of TiO2-400. It indicated that pure TiO2 showed good thermal stability in the whole temperature range. The modified material showed two stages of weight loss at 100–200 ℃ and 440–550 ℃, respectively (Fig. 6b). The weight loss from 100 to 200 °C was attributed to the elimination of absorbed water [45], and the weight loss above 400 ℃ may be attributed to the decomposition of N and C residue. After four cycles, the TG of Ti/Li-6-400 showed two loss range, included 40–90 ℃ and 440–550 ℃. Weight loss at 40–90 ℃ was attributed to absorption of DMC on the catalyst, and the weight loss of 440–550 ℃ was due to the decomposition of residual N and C in the catalyst. The total basicity and basic strength distributions of prepared materials were measured by TPD of CO2. The CO2-TPD profiles were presented in Fig. 7 . Fig. 7a showed the CO2 adsorption curves of the samples with different Li+ doping amounts calcinated at 400 ℃. The desorption peak observed at 200–300 ℃ was attributed to the weak basic site. The desorption peak appeared at 350–500 ℃ was associated with CO2 desorption from the medium basicity sites. The total basicity of samples became stronger with the increase of the amount of Li+ (Table 1 ), and it suggested that the total basicity of the catalyst was related to the content of Li+. The introduction of Li+ increased the negative charge of oxygen ion vacancy in TiO2 due to the lower ionization potential of Li compared with Ti, which leaded to the presence of weak and moderate basic sites on TiO2 surfaces. The profiles of CO2 desorption at different calcination temperatures were shown in Fig. 7b. The weak basic sites of Ti/Li-300 in the range of 200–300 ℃ were attributed to the incompletely decomposition of LiNO3, which could be observed in the FTIR of Fig. 1b. However, as the increase of calcination temperature, the weak basic active sites (LiNO3) became gradually weakened and even disappeared, which indicated the weak basic sites converted to moderate basic sties through the substitution of Ti4+ by Li+. After the calcining temperature was higher than 400 ℃, the decrease of medium basic sites indicated that the moderate basic sites were destroyed at high temperature. These results were agreement with the characterization of FT-IR, XPS and XRD. The effects of different Li+ doping molar ratio on reaction were shown in Table 2 . When the transesterification of DMC with BPA was carried out over anatase TiO2, the conversion of BPA only achieved 2.56%, and no DmC(1) was detected, but MmC(1) yield achieved 2.47%. However, when reaction was carried out over LiNO3, BPA conversion came up to 90.96%, and MmC(1) and DmC(1) yield reached 5.31% and 1%, respectively, but methylated product selectivity achieved 93.26%. When the molar ratio of Ti/Li was 2, BPA conversion reached 41.95%. At the same times, the yield of MmC(1) and DmC(1) significantly increased to 30.95% and 4.97%, respectively. When Ti/Li molar ratio increased to 8, BPA conversion declined to 29.86%, and MmC(1) and DmC(1) yield also decreased to 25.05% and 2.18%, respectively. From the above results, it could be seen that when the molar ratio of Ti/Li was 6, the catalyst displayed the excellent catalytic activity in transesterification, and the selectivity of methylation was the minimum. Fig. 8 . showed the effects of different calcination temperature on the transesterification of DMC with BPA. When the calcination temperature of catalysts was 300 ℃, the conversion of BPA reached the maximum of 48.62%, while methylated product selectivity achieved 16.87%. This may be due to the fact that LiNO3 was not fully decomposed at calcination temperature of 300 ℃ (FTIR and CO2-TPD). As the calcination temperature increased to 400 ℃, the yield of MmC(1) and DmC(1) came up to 36.36% and 5.97%, respectively. At the same times, the methylated product selectivity only achieved 9.3%. However, the activity of catalysts gradually decreased with increasing calcination temperature. In according to the results of XRD and CO2-TPD, the (101) peaks of Li+ doped TiO2 was more inclined to the 101 peaks of the anatase TiO2, and the medium basicity active sites reduced when catalysts were calcinated at 500 ℃ and 600 ℃, which indicated that some surface Ti-O-Li species disappeared. According to the above description, the catalyst had the best catalytic activity at 400 ℃ calcination temperature. In order to improve the yield of MmC(1) and DmC(1), the effects of catalyst usage amount on reaction were investigated, and results were shown in Fig. 9 . When the amount of Li/Ti-6-400 was 0.025 g, the conversion of BPA was 38.5%, the yield of MmC(1) and DmC(1) achieved 31.83% and 4.78%, respectively. As the amount of catalyst increased to 0.05 g, the conversion of BPA obtained the maximum 46.67%, and MmC(1) and DmC(1) yields increased to 36.36% and 5.97%, respectively. When the amount of catalyst further increased to 0.1 g, the conversion of BPA nearly remained unchanged, but DmC(1) yield declined to 2.31% and the methylated product selectivity came up to 12.35%. The excessive catalyst usage could lead to the decarboxylation of MmC(1) and DmC(1) [46]. The reusability of Ti/Li-6-400 was tested and the results were presented in Fig. 10 . The used catalysts after each reaction run could be collected though centrifugation. Afterwards, they were washed with DMC at least four times and then dried overnight at 120 ℃ in vacuum oven before using for next reaction. After four cycles, the catalyst was characterized by TG, XRD, FTIR. Compared with the fresh catalyst, the structure of the recovered catalyst was almost unchanged. At the four runs, the conversion of BPA reached 46.31%, the yield of MmC(1) and DmC(1) obtained 36.25% and 5.78%, respectively. The activity of the catalyst almost remains unchanged compared with the previous ones. Based on the above results of XRD, FTIR, CO2-TPD, XPS, Ti-O-Li species from Li+ being embedded in TiO2 lattice should be responsible for the good reusability in the reaction. The hypothetical reaction mechanism was listed in Scheme 2 . The positive electrical properties of carbonyl carbon atoms increased due to the coordination of methyl oxygen interact with the titanium atom of Ti-O-Li [24,47,48]. Moreover, the hydroxyl of BPA could be coordinated with lithium of Ti-O-Li to increase the nucleophilic property of hydroxyl and oxygen. Therefore, carbonyl carbon was easily attacked by hydroxyl oxygen to form MmC(1) or DmC(1). 4 Conclusions Li+ doped TiO2 were prepared by simple impregnation, and the transesterification of DMC with BPA were carried out over them. The structure and properties of the catalysts were obviously influenced by lithium doping amount and calcination temperature. The Ti/Li-6-400 catalyst showed that Li+ reacted with TiO2 to form surface Ti-O-Li, which was evidenced by FT-IR, XRD, XPS and CO2-TPD. When the catalysts were calcined at higher temperature, the titanium atom of internal TiO2 was replaced by lithium atom to form internal Ti-O-Li, which resulted in the decrease of catalyst activity. when the calcination temperature was 400 ℃ and the molar ratio of Ti/Li was 6, the catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity in the transesterification of BPA and DMC. The conversion of BPA reached 46.67%, and the yields of MmC(1) and DmC(1) reached to 36.36% and 5.97%, respectively. Moreover, Ti/Li-6-400 displayed the outstanding reusability. Therefore, Li doped TiO2 could be regarded as a potential catalyst for the transesterification of DMC with BPA.

        "dc:description": "Lithium doped TiO2 were prepared by simple impregnation, which was used as heterogeneous catalysts for the transesterification of DMC with BPA. The characterized results of FTIR, XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM and temperature programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD) showed that the structure and performance of the catalysts were obviously influenced by the doping amount of Li+ and calcining temperature. The optimum catalytic activity was obtained when the molar ratio of Ti/Li reached 6 and the calcination temperature came up to 400 ℃, which was due to Li+ reaction with TiO2 to form surface Ti-O-Li at 400 ℃ (Ti/Li-6-400). When the transesterification of DMC with BPA was carried out at 160–180 ℃ over Ti/Li-6-400, BPA conversion reached 46.67%, and the yields of one-methylcarbonate-ended-BPA (MmC(1)) and two-methylcarbonate-ended-BPA (DmC(1)) achieved 36.36% and 5.97%, respectively, and only 9.3% methylation selectivity was detected. In addition, the possible transesterification mechanism was provided.",
