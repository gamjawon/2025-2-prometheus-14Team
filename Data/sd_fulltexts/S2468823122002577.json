Institute of Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Graz University of Technology Petersgasse 12 Graz A-8010 Austria Carbohydrate fatty acid esters are important bio-based, non-ionic surfactants. Their synthesis confronts the challenge of reacting substrates of vastly different polarity. Here, we show imidazolium-based ionic liquids with basic anions (dicyanamide, acetate) as dual-function catalysts and solvents for an efficient C4-C18 fatty acid esterification of sucrose. The conversion proceeds from the anhydride, the vinyl ester, and the free fatty acid in that order of reactivity. It benefits ≥ 3-fold from a moderately polar, protic co-solvent (2-methyl-2-butanol, tert‑butanol) in ∼1:1 vol ratio with the ionic liquid. Optimized synthesis from vinyl palmitate (C16; ≤ 3-fold excess over 50 mM sucrose; 60 °C) was unexpectedly selective, giving the 6-O-mono-acyl product (∼70%) in quantitative yield. The ionic liquid-promoted conversion gains efficiency from the imidazolium cation aiding in sucrose solubilization and the basic anion providing catalytic facilitation to the esterification. By virtue of high reactivity at mild conditions and useful product selectivity, it advances the current repertoire of synthetic methods, including biocatalytic transformations, for sucrose palmitate ester production. Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract Keywords Sucrose esters [Bmim][dca] Basic-anion ionic liquids Selectivity (Trans)esterification 1 Introduction Esters of carbohydrates and fatty acids are important non-ionic surfactants with broad applicability and excellent eco-credentials as detergents and emulsifiers [1]. From this compound class, table sugar (sucrose) derived esters are widely used in food, personal care, and pharmaceutical products [2,3]. Their application-related functions are versatile, depending on the hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance of the molecular structure [3]. In particular, sucrose esters with palmitic acid (C16) are approved as inactive ingredients by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Their market is rapidly expanding [4]. Sucrose esters are synthesized by transesterification or reversed hydrolysis, typically under assistance from chemical or enzyme catalysis [2,3]. A fundamental challenge in all routes is to react substrates of vastly different polarity, hence solubility. Chemical acylation processes use non-benign and high-boiling polar solvents (e.g., pyridine, DMSO, and, DMF) to enhance the in solution availability of the carbohydrate substrate [5–9]. Considerable effort is required to remove these solvents from the product [8,10,11]. Note the requirement for tailored solvent conditions when sucrose is used instead of the considerably better organic solvent-soluble glucose. Solvent-free reactions necessitate elaborate strategies at emulsification but encounter issues of low yield, poor mixing, and decomposition of sugar at high temperature nonetheless [12,13]. Both approaches (transesterification, reversed hydrolysis) raise concern from the harsh conditions used (strong acid or base; high temperature) and the low product selectivity (position; degree of substitution) thus resulting [13,14]. The use of bio-catalysis (e.g., lipase/esterase, protease) gives better selectivity at milder conditions but appears limited by the available solvents able to dissolve sucrose while being compatible with enzyme activity [15]. Enzyme reactions in solvent-free systems usually show low performance [16,17]. New synthetic approaches that combine selectivity and mild conditions with flexible solvent use would be highly desirable. Ionic liquids are organic salts in the liquid state at ambient conditions of temperature and pressure. They typically consist of a large organic cation and a relatively small inorganic anion. Ionic liquids offer a number of characteristics that make them a promising class of alternative solvents. They generally show high thermostability, are non-volatile and can be recycled well. Ionic liquids are increasingly being applied as solvents in industrial processes [3,18]. They also have attracted considerable attention for use in the processing of cellulosic biomass [19]. However, besides serving as a solvent, ionic liquids can provide a catalytic function (e.g., that of a general acid-base) additionally [18]. Their use as catalysts is demonstrated in numerous examples, including the large-scale industrial production of bulk chemicals [18,20–22]. Ionic liquids based on imidazolium or tetraalkylammonium cations provide an effective solubilization of carbohydrates [23–25]. They are therefore promising for sugar ester production. In particular, the [Bmim][dca] (1‑butyl‑3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide) dissolves sucrose to a remarkable 282 g⋅L−1 at 60 °C [26]. Esterification from fatty acids and vinyl esters were shown for different carbohydrates, including cellulose, in imidazolium ionic liquids [27–30]. Chloride, acetate, and dicyanamide were frequently used anions. Lauric ester of glucose was synthesized in ionic liquid co-solvent (tetraalkylammonium acetate) [31]. Short-chain (C4) esters of sucrose were prepared in [Bmim][dca] [32]. Lipases were studied extensively in ionic liquids [33–36], but their use in these fluid environments for the synthesis of sucrose palmitate and related sucrose fatty acid esters is not well investigated. The aggregate evidence from several studies, including works on non-carbohydrate substrates [37–40], implicates the ionic liquid in a dual function, that is, solvent and acid-base catalyst, to promote the formation of the ester product [28,32]. The current inquiry was performed to explore imidazolium-based ionic liquids in just that dual function for the synthesis of fatty acid esters of sucrose, focusing on the palmitic acid ester in particular. We identified [Bmim] in combination with [OAc] or [dca] to enable reaction with useful synthetic efficiency. We present evidence suggesting a functional subdivision between the ionic liquid cation (solubilization) and the corresponding anion of moderate basicity (catalysis) in facilitating the conversion, by transesterification but also reverse hydrolysis (Scheme 1). 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals and reagents Sucrose was from Carl Roth. Fatty acids (butyric, palmitic, and oleic acid) and their corresponding anhydrides were from Sigma Aldrich. Vinyl palmitate was from TCI chemicals. Molecular sieve (UOP Type 3 Å, 8–12 mesh) and ionic liquids, [Bmim][Cl] and [Bmim][OAc], were from Sigma Aldrich. [Bmim][dca], [Bmim][TfO], [Bmim][Tf2N], and [Emim][OAc] were from abcr GmbH. Sucrose palmitate was from Carbosynth Ltd. According to the product datasheet, 80% of the compound is the mono-ester of sucrose (6-O- and 6′-O-sucrose palmitate monoesters). Novozyme 435 was from Strem Chemicals. Deuterated DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide-d6) was from Eurisotop. Activated carbon was from Merck. Anhydrous 2-methyl-2-butanol (2M2B) was from Sigma. Other organic solvents were from Carl Roth, Chem lab, Sigma Aldrich, and Fisher Scientific. All chemicals were of analytical grade. 2.2 Sucrose ester synthesis General procedure: All reactions were performed in 2 mL microtubes with temperature control (60 °C) and agitation (1200 rpm) on a thermomixer (ThermoMixer C; Eppendorf). Ionic liquid (600 µL) was used to dissolve sucrose (50 mM). The acyl donor (i.e., fatty acid, vinyl ester, anhydride) was added in the concentration shown, typically 150 mM. The acyl donor was usually only partially dissolved at this point. Organic co-solvent was added in a suitable volume ratio with ionic liquid. The total volume was fixed to 1 mL. Molecular sieves activated by drying at 300 °C were added (0.1 g, 10% w/v total volume). Samples (20 µL liquid) were taken every 24 h over 5 days of total reaction time. Varied parameters: Using the general procedure shown above, the varied parameters were as follows. Different ionic liquids (600 µL) were used with 2M2B (400 µL): [Bmim][dca], [Bmim][OAc], [Emim][OAc], [Bmim][Cl], [Bmim][TfO], and [Bmim][Tf2N]. The co-solvents used instead of 2M2B were t-butanol, ethanol, DMSO, DMF, pyridine, and ethyl acetate. They were used in combination with [Bmim][dca]. The ionic liquid:co-solvent volume ratio was fixed at 3:2. Using 2M2B, the volume ratio with ionic liquid ([Bmim][dca]) was varied from 0 to 80%. The acyl donors (150 mM) used were vinyl palmitate, butyric acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, butyric anhydride, decanoic anhydride, and palmitic anhydride, suspended in a solvent mixture of [Bmim][dca]:2M2B (3:2, v/v). The vinyl palmitate concentration was varied between 50 and 500 mM. 2.3 Sample preparation for analytics Isolation of the sucrose ester product(s) was done on activated carbon using a reported protocol with some modifications [41]. The reaction was stopped by adding 3 mL of water and activated carbon (0.3 g) to the mixture. It was confirmed that the product was not altered or degraded (e.g., through hydrolysis) in the procedure. The slurry was incubated for 1 h in a shaking incubator (Certomat BS-1, Sartorius Stedim Biotech) at 200 rpm and 20 °C. The solid was centrifuged off (Eppendorf 5810R; 4000 rpm, 15 min) and the supernatant was analyzed by carbohydrate HPLC. The activated carbon was washed with 4 mL water for 1 h with shaking incubation (200 rpm, 20 °C). TLC analysis showed that the wash solution contained only trace amounts of sucrose. Effectively all of sucrose was recovered in the supernatant. The sucrose esters were absorbed on the activated carbon. They were extracted from the solid using 4 mL chloroform/methanol (5:1, v/v) 3 times. The organic solvents were evaporated on a rotary evaporator (Laborota 4000, Heidolph) and the solid residue re-dissolved in acetonitrile/DMSO (6:4, v/v) mixture for the reversed-phase HPLC analysis. 2.4 Determination of residual sucrose and sucrose palmitate ester by HPLC analysis The residual sucrose in the water mixture was analyzed by carbohydrate HPLC. The supernatant was filtered with a syringe filter (Carl Roth, PTFE, 0.45 µm) and injected to Shimadzu Prominence liquid chromatograph (LC-20AD) equipped with a RI detector (RID-20A) and an autosampler (SIL-20AC HT). A YMC-Pack polyamine II column (250 × 4.6 mm) was utilized. Sucrose was eluted with acetonitrile:water (75:25, v/v) at 40 °C and a flow rate of 1 mL⋅min−1. The retention time of sucrose was 14.9 min under these conditions. The conversion was cacluated from the amount of consumed sucrose that was measured by HPLC analysis. The sucrose palmitate ester was measured by HPLC (Merck-Hitachi L-7100 Lachrom system) equipped with a RI detector (LaChrom RI detector L-7490), an autosampler (Lachrom L-7250), and a Nucleosil 100-C18 column (Sigma, 250 × 4.6 mm). The sucrose palmitate ester was eluted in a 30-min long isocratic run using acetonitrile/DMSO 9:1 (v/v). The flow rate was 0.5 mL⋅min−1 and the temperature was 40 °C. Sucrose palmitate esters were detected at retention times of 7.9 and 8.9 min. The authentic standards prepared in the current study were used to identify the 7.9-min peak as 6-O-palmityl sucrose. 2.5 Analysis A description of the preparative synthesis and the associated analytics, including TLC and NMR, can be found in the Materials and Methods section of the Supporting Information. 2.6 Biocatalytic assay Details of the enzymatic transesterification and the activity measurement using lipase are described in the Materials and Methods section of the Supporting Information. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis of sucrose ester in mixture of ionic liquid and organic solvents Considering sucrose solubility in ionic liquids, we first used pure [Bmim][dca] as the solvent and examined transesterification reaction at 60 °C with vinyl palmitate (150 mM) in 3-fold excess over sucrose. Vinyl palmitate has a solubility of 13.2 g⋅L−1 (47 mM; 60 °C) and was therefore not fully dissolved in the reaction mixture. The two-phase liquid mixture was agitated strongly (1200 rpm) for interfacial mass transfer. Sucrose ester formation was confirmed by TLC and reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. S1). To determine the residual sucrose, reaction samples were mixed with 3-fold volume of water and analyzed by carbohydrate HPLC. Results showed that the ester product increased at a slow rate to reach ∼20% yield (10 mM) after 120 h (Fig. 1 ). 2M2B (logP = 0.9) was then used as co-solvent in variable mixture (20–80%, v/v) with [Bmim][dca] (Fig. 1A). The product yield was dependent on the 2M2B content, with the best results (65%) obtained at 40% after 120 h. Sucrose and vinyl palmitate was dissolved completely in 40–60% [Bmim][dca] (Fig. S2). Interestingly, the experiments revealed that 2M2B and [Bmim][dca] were required in suitable combinations to achieve full dissolution of both vinyl palmitate and sucrose. When one of the two compounds was present at too low a content, the sucrose ester yield decreased (Figs. 1A and S1). A time course of sucrose ester synthesis is shown in Fig. 1B. The maximum conversion was reached after ∼120 h. Fatty acid formation by hydrolysis was below detection, suggesting that soluble vinyl palmitate was still present in excess at this point. We further showed the effect of the vinyl palmitate concentration. Using [Bmim][dca] and 2M2B in 3:2 vol ratio, the sucrose conversion was boosted to completion (≥ 95%; 120 h) when the vinyl palmitate was used in larger excess (≥ 5-fold). The full consumption of sucrose was confirmed by TLC and HPLC. We then analyzed other, moderately polar co-solvents of protic and aprotic type (Fig. 2 ). The co-solvents were used in constant 2:3 vol ratio with [Bmim][dca]. Vinyl palmitate was first dissolved in the co-solvent and the solution then added to the mixture of sucrose in [Bmim][dca]. The reaction yield (120 h) was 42% and 43% using t-BuOH (logP = 0.5) and EtOH (logP = −0.25), respectively. The other solvents showed low performance: DMF (27%; logP = −1), DMSO (7%; logP = −1.35), EtOAc (10%; logP = 0.7), and pyridine (22%; logP = 0.65). Changes in the yield were apparently unrelated to variation in the co-solvent polarity in the logP range studied. We, therefore, considered the miscibility of the organic co-solvent (with vinyl palmitate dissolved in it) and the [Bmim][dca] as a possible factor of reaction efficiency. Of note, the solubility of vinyl palmitate exceeded 1.0 M in each co-solvent at 60 °C, with DMSO as an exception (∼0.2 M). The polar protic co-solvents were well miscible with 60% [Bmim][dca] to give a single liquid phase. The aprotic co-solvents, by contrast, caused phase separation. The importance of the protic nature of the co-solvent was emphasized from a comparison of 2M2B and t-BuOH (both protic) with EtOAc (aprotic) at a similar logP. The 2M2B and the t-BuOH were well miscible with the [Bmim][dca] while the EtOAc gave a two-phase mixture with the ionic liquid. These results can have general relevance in suggesting that both substrates must be dissolved in the ionic liquid phase to promote efficient reaction for sucrose ester formation. A previous study has found a role of polar aprotic co-solvent (e.g., DMSO) in enhancing the catalytic function of ionic liquid in transesterification [42]. The co-solvent was suggested to promote ion separation by solvating the cation preferentially. This would benefit the reactivity by enhancing the concentration of anion effectively available for catalysis. In the case of sucrose ester synthesis from vinyl palmitate, however, the solubility of both substrates in the [Bmim][dca] phase appeared to be the more decisive criterion of reactivity than solvent separation of the ionic liquid components. 3.2 Influence of ionic liquid type on sucrose ester synthesis Next, we examined the effect from a variation of the anion (trifluoromethanesulfonate, TfO−; bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, Tf2N−; OAc−; Cl−) in [Bmim] ionic liquid, using the established single-phase solvent mixture with 2M2B (40%). The sucrose solubility was strongly affected by the anion used. Ionic liquids based on Cl− and OAc− dissolved the sucrose (50 mM) completely. Ionic liquids based on TfO− and Tf2N− showed considerably decreased (≥ 50%) dissolution capacity for sucrose and also gave low product formation (≤ 10 mM). However, the solubility of sucrose was not a sufficient criterion of reactivity. [Bmim] ionic liquid with Cl− showed excellent solubility but gave poor yield (4.5 mM). Remarkably, only the OAc− anion supported good reactivity, with almost full conversion (94%) of the sucrose in 24 h. Encouraged by the result, we lowered the vinyl palmitate concentration to just 2-fold or no excess over the sucrose concentration used and still obtained, respectively, 84% and 65% yield after 24 h. Normalized on the vinyl palmitate concentration used, we can compare the ester formation rates in [Bmim][OAc] (2.7 × 10−2 h−1) and [Bmim][dca] (1.8 × 10−3 h−1) at effectively identical sucrose conversion (65%): reactivity in the two ionic liquids differed ∼15-fold. Parameter accountable for the difference in reactivity might be the pK a of the ionic liquid anion. The pK a is ∼4.8 for OAc− and ∼0.73 for dca−. Dependence on pK a is arguably explainable by the ionic liquid anion providing base catalytic assistance to the reaction (Scheme 2). From the relationship, β = log R/ΔpK a where β is Brønsted coefficient, R is reactivity difference expressed as a ratio of reaction rates, and ΔpK a is a difference in pK a between OAc− and dca−, one calculates that β = +0.29. Uncertainty of analysis from a limited set of data notwithstanding, this β value would be consistent with partial proton transfer from the reactive OH of sucrose to the catalytic base in the transition state of transesterification, as proposed in Scheme 2. This explanation is consistent with a previous study of cellulose dissolution in ionic liquid that showed OAc− to surpass dca− in functioning as hydrogen bond acceptor and anions having higher pK a to facilitate acylation more efficiently [43–45]. The ionic liquid cation might provide additional stabilization to negative charge development on the carbonyl oxygen in the transition state, as suggested in an earlier paper [31], but there was no immediate evidence from the current study to clarify the point. As a catalytic factor to providing rate acceleration to the reaction, however, the protonic assistance from a general base seems to be of considerably higher importance. From the results shown emerges an interpretation of the promoting role of [Bmim] ionic liquids in the formation of sucrose palmitate esters. A functional subdivision between cation and anion is suggested. The role of imidazolium cations in the solubilization of carbohydrates is well explained from aromatic interaction with the hydrogen bond-stabilized complex of the carbohydrate and the ionic liquid anion [46]. On the other hand, the corresponding anion (e.g., OAc− compared with Cl−) has a significant role in promoting the desired transesterification. The anion controls the reactivity of the solubilized sucrose toward ester product formation. It may achieve this through base catalytic facilitation dependent on its pK a. Our mechanistic interpretation appears to be well in line with a substantial body of evidence on the esterification of non-carbohydrates substrates in ionic liquids [37–40]. More specifically with carbohydrates, the acetylation of starch in [Bmim] ionic liquids proceeded to a 20-fold larger degree of polysaccharide substitution (DS) when the anion was OAc− or dca− compared to Cl− (DS = 0.008) [27]. Study showing that [Bmim][Cl] was unable to promote the esterification of starch suggested catalytic reactivity of the anion dependent on the pK a [28]. Syntheses of fatty acid esters of cellulose in [Bmim] ionic liquids with variable anions revealed that basic anions exhibited the largest acylation power [27]. The here proposed interpretation furthermore receives support from additional experiments in which the [Bmim] was replaced by 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium [Emim] cation in ionic liquid with [OAc]. Reactivity of sucrose ester formation under standard conditions (40% 2M2B; 3-fold donor over 50 mM sucrose; ≥ 95% yield in 24 h) was well comparable in the two ionic liquids. An important insight from the study of glucose laurate synthesis in tetraalkylammonium acetate ionic liquid was that enzyme (Novozyme 435 lipase) did not accelerate the transesterification of glucose with vinyl laurate over the basic reactivity already provided by the “catalytic” solvent. Using [Bmim][dca] in 3:2 vol ratio with 2M2B, we showed that Novozyme 435 only modestly (+8%; 65% → 73% after 120 h) enhanced the conversion into the sucrose ester (see the Supporting Information for the methods used). Enzyme stability was a relevant factor under the solvent conditions used: the Novozyme 435 lost 35% of its activity within 20 h whereas it was stable in that time when just 2M2B was used as the solvent (for the enzyme activity assay, see the Supporting Information). However, the enzyme activity was sufficient to have made a clear difference in the case that it had been additional to the catalytic effect of the ionic liquid. By way of comparison, the enzyme-catalyzed conversion in 2M2B containing 20% DMSO was 33% after 120 h. 3.3 Effect of acyl donors on sucrose ester synthesis To explore the versatility of the sucrose ester formation promoted in ionic liquid, we analysed the reaction via reversed hydrolysis from free fatty acid as well as transfer reaction from fatty acid anhydride. [Bmim][dca] in 40% mixture with 2M2B was used and the fatty acid chain length varied between C4 and C18 in donor substrate used in 3-fold excess over sucrose. The reaction was continued for 120 h at 60 °C with shaking incubation (1200 rpm). Results are shown in Fig. 3 and more fully in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Reactivity in reversed hydrolysis of palmitic acid was lower (30% conversion) than in transesterification of vinyl palmitate, as expected, but sucrose ester was still formed in substantial amounts (Fig. 3). The yield increased with decreasing chain length of both anhydrides and fatty acids. The anhydrides showed good reactivity. Acylation of glucose from anhydride donors was previously shown in ionic liquid [32], but a reaction involving anhydrides of longer chain fatty acids was not demonstrated. 3.4 Structural analysis of sucrose ester synthesized in ionic liquid We used adsorption on activated carbon for the isolation of the sucrose ester product(s). Product identification is shown below. As shown in Fig. S1, the product recovery from the reaction mixture was complete. Solvent elution gave the purified product (≥ 99% recovery from the reaction mixture) in useful yield (∼70%). Earlier studies [41] show that treatment with activated carbon can separate carbohydrates efficiently (up to 90%) from [Bmim][dca]. Thus, besides isolation of the sucrose ester product, recycling of the ionic liquid is facilitated additionally. Technologies for ionic liquid recovery from carbohydrate product mixtures involve simple evaporation, filtration, fractionated distillation or combinations thereof [47,48]. Recovery rates are typically good (e.g., 90% for [Emim][OAc] recovered from pre-treated lignocellulosic biomass [48]). Given the difficulty of separating water and ionic liquid, as shown in several studies [49,50], a possible advantage of the current non-aqueous reaction system should be noted. The specific heat capacity of 2M2B is ∼1.5-fold lower than that of water [51,52]. Examples of industrial recovery of ionic liquids are shown in literature [53,54]. At this stage, therefore, the requirement to recycle the ionic liquid does not detract from the interest in its use as solvent-catalyst for sucrose ester synthesis. We also note that enzymes will have to be recycled and their limited stability may prevent this. The sucrose ester produced from the transesterification with vinyl palmitate (150 mM; 3-fold excess over sucrose) in [Bmim][dca] was isolated and analysed by NMR (Fig. S3). Only mono-acylated sucrose was obtained. The main component (70%) was 6-O-palmityl sucrose. The remaining 30% was comprised of mainly 6′-O-palmityl sucrose. The product selectivity of the [Bmim][dca]-promoted conversion of sucrose was comparable to that of reaction of Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (Lipozyme TLIM; enzyme immobilized on silica gel) in a solvent mixture of ionic liquid ([1-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl)−5,6,7,8-tetrahydroimidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-1-ium][NTf2]) and 2M2B, as shown in Table 1 . Using vinyl laurate (180 mM; 4-fold excess) as the donor, the sucrose was converted into 6-O-lauryl sucrose (94% selectivity) in 68% yield within 24 h [55]. Interestingly, the same Lipozyme reaction in just 2M2B gave only 37% conversion in 36 h [55]. To the extent that reaction conditions can be compared, the 6-O-mono-acylated sucrose was also obtained as the main product (70%) from base-catalysed transesterification reactions in DMSO (Table 1) [56]. However, the monoester product selectivity is generally much lower in these reactions, especially under conditions of acyl donor used in excess over sucrose [9,56,57]. The sucrose diester was formed in substantial amounts (30–40% of the total product) [9,56] and even multiple esterifications of sucrose were observed [57]. Strategies aimed at increasing the monoester content in total product require multistep procedures of reaction and purification, as shown in Table 1 (see the entry for reference [58]). The particular characteristics of selectivity of the ionic liquid-promoted reaction (site selectivity, control of degree of esterification) could present a distinct advantage for the synthesis. They become important especially when a high conversion of sucrose is demanded in the process, so that excess of acyl donor must be used to achieve the effect. Selectivity control is challenging to gain under these conditions in common solvents applied to industrial production of sucrose esters [9,11,56,57]. There is considerable interest in the 6-O-monoester of sucrose with long-chain fatty acid [59,60]. Besides versatile use as detergent and emulsifier [60,61], the products can show interesting antimicrobial properties [16,55]. Compared to reaction in [Bmim][dca], the reaction in [Bmim][OAc] showed lower selectivity in sucrose palmitate synthesis. From TLC analysis (Fig. S4), we estimated the content of sucrose mono-ester to be ∼60%. The remaining 40% of the product were multiply esterified forms of sucrose. An earlier study of acetylation of sucrose with acetic anhydride in [Bmim][dca] showed complete esterification of the sugar hydroxy groups [32]. Therefore, while not as pronounced as in the reaction with [Bmim][dca], the reaction in [Bmim][OAc] might involve selectivity still in an extent to make it useful for the synthesis of sucrose palmitate esters of low acylation degree. 4 Conclusion In summary, [Bmim]-based ionic liquid in combination with basic anions such as [dca] and [OAc] was identified as a synthetically useful dual solvent-catalyst for the (trans)esterification of sucrose with palmitate. Solvent mixture of ionic liquid and 2M2B achieved optimum synthetic efficiency due to efficient interplay of solubilization of both substrates and catalytic assistance to (trans)esterification. The reaction in [Bmim][dca] was remarkably selective with acyl donor in excess, better so than chemical acylation of sucrose reported to date (Table 1), to give the mono-acylated product, with palmitate attached mainly (70%) at the 6-O position of the sucrose. The regioselectivity was comparable to that of enzymatic conversions in organic solvent, like that of Candida antarctica lipase B in t-BuOH with vinyl palmitate [62] or that of T. lanuginosus lipase with vinyl laurate in solvent mixture of 2M2B and DMF [63]. Besides the general interest in sustainable methods of synthesis of carbohydrate esters, the mono-acylated sucrose palmitate has important applications as emulsifying flavor, color, and nutraceutical ingredients to produce clear beverage products. Our results support the idea of ionic liquid-promoted ester synthesis in the absence of enzyme, consistent with realizations made in earlier work on glucose lauric acid ester prepared in tetraalkylammonium acetate [31].

        "dc:description": "Carbohydrate fatty acid esters are important bio-based, non-ionic surfactants. Their synthesis confronts the challenge of reacting substrates of vastly different polarity. Here, we show imidazolium-based ionic liquids with basic anions (dicyanamide, acetate) as dual-function catalysts and solvents for an efficient C4-C18 fatty acid esterification of sucrose. The conversion proceeds from the anhydride, the vinyl ester, and the free fatty acid in that order of reactivity. It benefits ≥ 3-fold from a moderately polar, protic co-solvent (2-methyl-2-butanol, tert‑butanol) in ∼1:1 vol ratio with the ionic liquid. Optimized synthesis from vinyl palmitate (C16; ≤ 3-fold excess over 50 mM sucrose; 60 °C) was unexpectedly selective, giving the 6-O-mono-acyl product (∼70%) in quantitative yield. The ionic liquid-promoted conversion gains efficiency from the imidazolium cation aiding in sucrose solubilization and the basic anion providing catalytic facilitation to the esterification. By virtue of high reactivity at mild conditions and useful product selectivity, it advances the current repertoire of synthetic methods, including biocatalytic transformations, for sucrose palmitate ester production.",
