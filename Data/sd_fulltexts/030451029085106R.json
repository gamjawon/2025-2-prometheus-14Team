The TPR spectra of Ni/SiOg exhibits a single peak with the characteristic shape of first-order kinetics. In contrast, two distinct peaks are observed for Ni/TiOg, which indicates that there are two different reaction sites. The high temperature peak shows behavior similar to that of Ni/SiOg, and it is believed that the corresponding sites are composed of nickel atoms. The low temperature peak is attributed to the hydrogenation of CO adsorbed on Ni TiO^ sites. Some interrupted experiments indicate the formation of a common intermediate species from both reaction sites. Thus, a mechanistic model is proposed on the basis of experimental observation. Computer simulation of the TPR spectra shows that the model fits the system well. By comparison with carbon hydrogenation experiments, the intermediate is believed to be the active surface carbon. This mechanism satisfactorily explains the high activity of CO hydrogenation on Ni/TiOa catalyst. Introduction The report of strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) in titania- supported metal catalysts by Tauster et al. [1] in 1978 stimulated numerous research projects to clarify the roles played by the supporting material in catalysis. The occurrence of SMSI is usually accompanied by the suppression of CO and/or hydrogen adsorption [1,2]. Moreover, it was found [3,4] that titania-supported nickel has high activity and amazingly high selectivity toward long chain hydrocarbons in CO hydrogenation. Recently, a number of studies on the titanium-supported Pt, Rh, Fe, Ni catalysts carried out by Dumesic [6-9,12,14,20,22,23] and others [5,10,11,13,15-19,21, 24,25] have overwhelmingly shown that the active Group VIII metal and titania *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 334 interdiffuse rapidly in the hydrogen atmosphere during reduction. The partially reduced Ti0 species migrate to the metal surface and interact with the surface metal atoms. Consequently the chemisorptive properties of the metal are greatly altered [10,11,14,22,24,25]. But thus far no definite conclusions about the particular kinetic behavior of Ni/TiOg have been made. In conventional steady-state kinetic studies, overall catalytic behavior is observed without giving detailed insight into the mechanistic steps. The use of temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) overcomes this shortcoming, since it measures the specific reaction rate and has the advantage of resolving individual reaction pathways by their different sensitivities to- wards temperature variations. The related theories, techniques and applica- tions of TPR have been reviewed by Falconer and Schwarz [26]. By the use of TPR for CO hydrogenation, Falconer and Zagli found that the hydrogenation of pre-adsorbed CO on Ni/SiOg follows first order kinetics [27], Kester et al. discovered two distinct reaction sites and their interactions on Ni/Ala03 [28,29]. The two TPR peaks on Ni/AlgOa, Pt/AlgOa and Ru/AlgOg have been attributed by Falconer et al. [30 32] and Robbins and Marucchi-Soos [33] to the hydrogenation of CO on nickel atoms and the CHsO complex on alumina support. The TPR of CO hydrogenation on Ni/TiOg has been conducted by Ozdogan et al. [34], two distinct reaction sites were also found and a more detailed study has been conducted very recently by Sen and Falconer. In the present work, a systematic study by TPR of pre-adsorbed CO with hydrogen on Ni/TiOg was conducted. For comparison, some work on Ni/SiOz was reviewed. A reaction model is proposed to interpret the experimental results. Computer simulation of the model was used to analyze the TPR spectra, and the kinetic parameters were evaluated by fitting with the experimental data. Experimental Catalysts Supported catalysts with nickel loadings of 5 wt.% were prepared by impregnation of silica (Degussa Aerosil 200, 200 25m2g-l) and titania (Degussa P-25, 50 15m2g-l) with an aqueous solution of nickel nitrate (Merck, GR) to incipient wetness. The impregnated catalysts were dried overnight at 400 K. Prior to CO chemisorption and temperature-programmed reaction, the catalysts were reduced in situ in flowing hydrogen (60 cm3 mm\"1) at 723 K for 15 h. Apparatus CO chemisorption and temperature-programmed reaction were carried out in a flow system. The main part of the apparatus is schematically shown in Fig. 1. About 0.25 g Ni/SiOz or 0.75 g Ni/TiOa was placed in a 8-mm i.d. U-shaped Pyrex glass reactor for each test. One thermocouple fixed to the outer wall of the reactor was used for feedback control of the temperature 335 He or H; | | V T V t He CO Fig. 1.

Another thermocouple was inserted into the catalyst bed for monitoring the temperature. Two four-way valves Fl and F2 were provided to change the inlet gas stream. The three-way valve T and six-way valves Sl and S2 were used to admit the effluent gas from the reactor to a Porapak Q column (4 m, 423 K) or directly to the FID detector for analysis. Procedure Before chemisorption, the catalyst was purged in helium at 723 K for 1 h to desorb any hydrogen remaining after in situ reduction, then it was cooled to 300 K in helium. At 300 K, a number of 1-ml CO pulses were repeatedly injected to the catalyst bed until saturated adsorption was obtained. The CO uptake was calculated by subtracting the effluent amount of each pulse from the total amount pulsed. Following chemisorption, the TPR of adsorbed CO was conducted by heating the catalyst in hydrogen from 300 K to 723 K. The product of the TPR was periodically sampled by valve Sl and analyzed by the Porapak Q column. A complete TPR spectrum similar to that observed by Ozdogan et al. [34] was obtained. Some CO desorbed at low temperature and a small amount of ethane was formed just before the main methane peak. Water begins to appear at about 450 K due to readsorption on the TiOz support. Since the hydrocarbon produced is mainly methane (over 95%) and the FID detector is insensitive to CO and water, the effluent gas from the reactor can be directly monitored by the FID to obtain the TPR spectra. The FID output was calibrated to methane-producing rate by standard pure methane gas (Methanson). The procedure described above can be modified for other purposes, such as the interrupted TPR or carbon hydrogenation experiments, which will be described below. 336 300 700 400 500 600 TEMPERATURE (K) Fig. 2.

Results Temperature-programmed hydrogenation of'pre -adsorbed CO The respective TPR spectra of the hydrogenation of CO pre-adsorbed on Ni/TiOa and Ni/SiOg are shown in Fig. 2 and the related data are listed in Table 1. For Ni/SiOa, a single peak at 467 K is observed. The peak is asymmetric in shape, which is typical of a first-order desorption process. For Ni/TiOg, two distinct peaks appear, showing carbon monoxide is absorbed and reacted on two distinct reaction sites. The low-temperature peak (peak A) centered at 409 K is very sharp and exhibits significant tailing. The high-temperature peak (peak B) is much broader with Tp at 518 K.

For Ni/SiOg, the activation energy of 76 kJ mol\"1 estimated by the peak-width method using first order kinetics parameters [26], is in good agreement with the value of 80 kJ mol~1 obtained via heating rate variation. But on Ni/TiOg, drastically different values of activation energy are obtained when these two methods are applied. Since activation energies can be obtained by heating rate variations only if (1) it is a single-path irreversible reaction, and (2) the reaction rate can be expressed as a single variable function of the amount adsorbed and the temperature [26]. This implies that on Ni/TiOa the hydrogenation of absorbed carbon monoxide cannot be explained by simple kinetics. Furthermore, peak A of Ni/TiOg exhibits significant tailing, which is unusual in a normal temperature-programmed process. One reason for this tailing might be the readsorption of the reaction product. But on increasing the flow rate of hydrogen, the tailing does not diminish. The reaction product of the TPR being methane, it is also not very likely that methane is re-adsorbed on nickel in the temperature range used in our TPR test. Because of the unusual shape of the tailing, it cannot be explained simply by adding another parallel reaction site at that temperature either. These factors indicate that some complex mechanism may exist on Ni/TiOg for CO hydrogenation. In order to gain further insight, a series of interrupted experiments were conducted. Interrupted experiments In the series of TPR with interruption in hydrogen, the catalyst with pre-adsorbed CO was first heated in hydrogen to the interruption temperature, followed by rapid cooling to 300 K in hydrogen, and then a second heating program for TPR was conducted. Figure 3 presents the interrupted TPR spectra for Ni/SiOg. The peak temperatures of the second TPR are all identical, and exactly equal to the peak temperatures of the original TPR of Ni/SiOg. As the pre-absorbed carbon monoxide is partially consumed during the first TPR, the second TPR spectra just correspond to the different initial amounts of adsorbed carbon monoxide. In the temperature-programmed process, only for first-order desorption processes are the peak temperatures 338 300 '.00 500 600 TEMPERATURE (K) 700 400 500 600 TEMPERATURE (K) Fig. 3.

Therefore, the results in Fig. 3 clearly proves that the hydrogenation of adsorbed carbon monoxide on Ni/SiOa is first order in the adsorbed carbon monoxide. Similar results have been obtained by Falconer and Zagli from the TPR of activated adsorption of COa on Ni/SiOa [27]; we reviewed the work here by the interrupted technique. Figure 4 shows the interrupted TPR on Ni/TiOg. It can be seen that the main peak A decreases in intensity with increasing interruption tempera- tures and its tail becomes more pronounced. For the TPR interrupted at 403 K (Fig. 4c), the tail itself appears as a broad peak centered at 415 K. As the interruption temperature is further increased, this broad peak shifts to higher temperatures and decreases in size. Finally when the interruption is terminated at 473 K (Fig. 4f), only peak B remains in the spectrum. The fact that the tail of peak A eventually becomes a peak demonstrates that the tailing part may correspond to the hydrogenation of another surface species, possibly an intermediate in CO hydrogenation on Ni/TiOg. In another series of interrupted experiments, the first heating program and the subsequent cooling were carried out in helium, then a second TPR was conducted in hydrogen. Figure 5 presents the second TPR of Ni/TiOg. As can be seen, the sizes of peaks A and B decrease while the broad peak corresponding to the tail (centered at 415 K) becomes larger with increasing interruption temperatures. Both peaks A and B gradually shift to the tailing part in helium atmosphere. Eventually, peak A becomes a rear shoulder of the original tail species and peak B vanishes (Fig. 5e). Obviously, the tailing species can be formed from both sites. When the initial heating program was 339 300 '.00 500 600 700 300 400 500 600 700 TEMPERATURE (K) TEMPERATURE (K) Fig. 5.

The TPR spectra ofNi/TiOz after CO exposure at 573 K in helium; (a) 1 (b) 2 (c) 3 (d) 5 pulses of CO. interrupted at 523 K or above (Fig.5d and 5e), a small amount of very reactive species appears, leading to methane formation immediately on contact with hydrogen at 300 K. From this experimental evidence, it is suspected that the tail of peak A in the CO hydrogenation TPR may result from the hydrogenation of an intermediate surface species. This species is stable in helium and can be formed from carbon monoxide adsorbed on both sites on Ni/TiOg. TPR of carbon hydrogenation In these experiments, Ni/TiOa was initially subjected to a varying number of CO pulses at 573 K carried by helium. The amount of CO in each pulse corresponded to 430% of the full CO uptake of Ni/TiOg. When CO was pulsed through at 573 K, COa was produced via the disproportionation of carbon monoxide; hence carbon was deposited on the catalyst along with the molecularily adsorbed CO. After pulsing CO at high temperature, the catalyst was cooled to 300 K in helium and a TPR was conducted in hydrogen. The TPR spectra thus obtained are shown in Fig. 6. Their main characteristic is a big broad peak centered at about 415 K, which represents the hydrogenation of the deposited carbon. Moreover, a very reactive species appears which results in methane formation at room temperature. Peak A in the CO hydrogenation TPR can still be observed as a front shoulder at 375 K after 1-2 pulses of CO, and peak B also appears at about 500 K. The total methane formed during these experiments increases from 18.9 Jumol g~1 after 1 pulse of CO to 41.9 jiimol g~1 after 5 pulses of CO. 340 These data are all much higher than the CO uptakes of Ni/TiOg (12.6/nnolg~1), indicating that there are more available sites than the amount measured by chemisorption for surface carbon to occupy. It is interesting to note that the peak temperature and the peak shape of these carbon hydrogenations are almost identical to those of the tailing species observed in the TPR after interruption in helium. This suggests that the tailing part of peak A in the original TPR of Ni/TiOg may result from the hydrogenation of surface carbon. To confirm these findings on nickel catalysts without support interactions, similar experiments were done on Ni/SiOg. Figure 7 presents the results of the parallel experiments on Ni/SiOg. The resulting TPR spectra are similar to those found on Ni/TiOg. After one pulse of CO, a very active species appears and a broad peak is generated at about 390 K. Another peak corresponding to the hydrogenation of molecu- larly adsorbed CO is also observed. The total amount of methane formed during TPR increases from 29.1 to 48.1jumolg~1 with CO pulse numbers increased from 1 to 3. These amounts are less than the CO uptakes measured by chemisorption (59.9jumolg~1), but are all higher than the amount of methane evolved in the TPR of CO hydrogenation on Ni/SiOa (Table 2). From the above description, it can be seen that the carbon pre-deposited on Ni/SiOg is hydrogenated at about the same temperature as that on Ni/TiOa. Moreover, the intermediate species corresponding to the tail of peak A on Ni/TiOz also hydrogenates at that temperature with about the same peak shape. These indicate that the intermediate species discovered on Ni/TiOa is just the surface carbon from CO dissociation. Furthermore, it was found that, on Ni/SiOg, the metal surface area measured by CO chemisorp- tion is reasonable, for the amount of the deposited carbon never exceeds the CO uptake. But on Ni/TiOz, CO chemisorption is decreased by the support interaction, therefore there are more available sites for carbon to occupy than 400 500 600 700 TEMPERATURE (K) Fig. 7. The TPR spectra ofNi/SiOg after CO exposure at 573 K with (a) 1 (b) 2 (c) 3 (d) 5 pulses of CO. 300 341 that measured by CO uptake. Moreover, it can be seen from Figs. 6 and 7 that the amount of molecular CO adsorbed on Ni/TiOg is much less than that on Ni/SiOa as CO is pulsed through'at 573 K. The CO adsorbed on Ni/TiOa is much easier to dissociate than that on Ni/SiOa. Falconer et al. [34] and Bartholomew and Vance [21] have studied the support effect on the hydrogenation of pre-deposited carbon on nickel catalysts, and similar TPR peaks of carbon hydrogenation have been observed by Falconer. Both of them found that for carbon hydrogenation, nickel catalysts on different supports exhibit the same behavior. Since carbon hydrogenation has no support effects, hydrogenation of the pre-deposited carbon on nickel catalysts should take place on nickel atoms which have no interaction with the support. To summarize the above evidence and to interpret the results, we propose the mechanistic model described below. Presentation of the reaction model From the above experimental evidence, it is shown that on Ni/TiOg, carbon monoxide can be hydrogenated on two distinct reaction sites. It seems that there exist reaction paths through which carbon monoxide adsorbed on both sites will be converted to a common intermediate before hydrogenation to methane occurs. Hydrogenation of this intermediate appears to be the tailing part of peak A in the TPR spectra. If we denote the low temperature site on Ni/TiOz as site (A), the high temperature site as site (B) and the intermediate as I, a reaction model can be proposed to account for the mechanistic steps for the hydrogenation of adsorbed CO on Ni/TiOg. The model is schematically shown as follows: CO (A) H2 >CH4 a,*. /^-CH, |d,*d CO(B) where path a forms the low temperature peak (peak A), the tail of peak A is formed by path b-c and peak B corresponds to path d-c. To prove the existence of path d on Ni/TiOg, further experiments have been conducted. These experiments involved a TPR on only adsorbed CO (B) with vacant site A and I. The Ni/TiOa catalyst was first subjected to TPR in hydrogen up to 473 K, the temperature at which CO (A) and intermediate I formed from CO (A) has been consumed; the gas stream was then changed to helium and the temperature held at 473 K for a period of time. Finally the catalyst bed was cooled to 300 K in helium and the second TPR was performed in hydrogen. The second TPR spectra of these experiments are presented in Fig. 8. It can be seen that if the catalyst is directly cooled in hydrogen without the holding period in helium, the second TPR consists of 342 400 500 600 700 TEMPERATURE (K) Fig. 8.

But if the catalyst is held in helium for a period of time (Fig. 8b-d), A broad peak centered at the temperature range corresponding to the hydrogenation of intermediate I appears. The longer the holding time, the larger the peak I grows at the expense of peak B. Carbon monoxide adsorbed on site B is converted to the intermediate I before it is hydro- genated to methane. This proves the existence of path d in our model. Computer simulation of the TPR Spectra If our model can describe catalytic behavior on Ni/TiOg, it should be able to predict the TPR spectra. We calculated the theoretical TPR from our model by computer simulation. The governing differential equations were proposed on the basis of free re-adsorption [26]. On the observation that there are more available sites than that measured by chemisorption, the total amount of surface species should not be limited and it can be assumed that there are three kinds of species on Ni/TiOz: CO on site A, CO on site B, and intermediate I. Since the hydrogenation of CO absorbed on Ni/SiOa is a first-order process, it is also reasonable to assume that each path in our model is first order in reactants. Following these assumptions, the TPR spectra can be calculated from the equations formulated according to the reaction model: ^---(A.COA+AbCOA) (1) -^ (AbCOA+^COB-AJ) dl p dCOB_ 1 -d7 -^dCOB (2) (3) 343 where f) is the heating rate, k , k^, kc, and k^ denote the rate constants for the corresponding path and are functions of temperature only: k,=Aexp(-EJRT) (4) ^b=Bexp(-Eb/J?T) (5) k^Cexp(-E^RT) (6) Ad=Dexp(-Ed/.RT) (7) where A, B, C, D are pre-exponential factors and E^, E^, Ec, E^ are activation energies. at T = To, COA=COAO (8) I=Io (9) COs = COeo (10) where To is the temperature at which TPR starts, COAo, COBo and Io are initial coverages of sites A, B and I respectively. The function of the methane production rate versus temperature which consists the TPR spectra, can be calculated from the solution ofCOA and I as: (11) Equations (1) (10) consist a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. It was solved and fitted with the experimental data by a computer program obtained by combining an O.D.E. solver subroutines (STIFFS [35]) and a parameter searching package. The nonlinear data regression package is called GRG2, and applies a reduced gradient searching method [36]. Fourteen sets of experimental TPR data of Ni/TiOg, including heating rate variations and interrupted experiments, were synthesized by computer simulation. The activation energies obtained from computer fitting are listed in Table 3 and a few cases of the simulated TPR spectra are shown in Figs. 9 12 to compare with the experimental data. During the fitting, the initial kinetic parameters were estimated from the half-width method. Since the interrupted experiments change only the initial coverages and should not alter the rate constants, the activation energies were limited to be about the same and the pre-exponential factors were constrained within a factor of three for all cases studied. Only the two initial coverages (the third is not unknown, and can be obtained by subtracting the other two from the total methane evolved) were allowed to vary for each individual case. Therefore the degree of freedom is not large and the results obtained should have actual physical meanings and should not be taken as empirical correlations. The fitted results show that path a has a very high activation energy of ~210 kJ mol~1. But the pre-exponential factor for path a is also high, causing peak A to be produced at relatively low temperatures.

The activation energy {or path b is about 45 kJ mol~1 and path b can take place within a very broad temperature range, starting at temperatures where path a is not yet activated. Therefore part of the CO (A) is converted to intermediate I before it reacts with hydrogen through path a. This part of intermediate I is hydrogenated to methane through path c, and appears as the tailing part of peak A. The temperature range for path c is even broader than for path b. In the TPR of only molecularly adsorbed COA and COB, no methane is formed from path c until some COA has been converted to I, but path b occurs at a higher temperature range than path c, and therefore the front half of the peak generated from path c disappears and the rear half of it appears as the tail of peak A. As for the carbon monoxide adsorbed on site (B), since path d has a high activation energy (80 kJ mol~1), it must be converted to intermediate I at relatively high temperatures, but it is readily hydrogenated to methane as soon as it is converted to intermediate 346 JU-t I f I i I l 1 i i 200 300 400 500 600 700 Temperature (K) 6-00-i 300 400 500 600 Temperature (K) , 0.80 - 0.60 | 0.40- S a20- S i 0.00 200 300 400 500 600 700 Temperature (K) 5000. 8 40.00.

Path d appears as a rate-determining step, and this step in the series of reaction paths d~c makes peak B characteristic of only path d. As may be seen from Table 3 and Figs. 9-12, excellent simulations of all the TPR spectra can be obtained by calculations based on our reaction model and all the TPR characteristics, including peak positions, peak shapes and the peak size, can be well predicted. This gives the theoretical basis to our reaction model and proves it works well on the Ni/TiOg system. It is interesting to note that reaction path d has an activation energy very similar to that on Ni/SiOg. In carbon hydrogenation experiments performed on Ni/SiOg, the TPR spectra or pre-deposited carbon also show broad peaks centered at about the same temperature range as the in- termediate I on Ni/TiOz. Consequently, it is suspected that on Ni/SiOg, reaction paths similar to path d-c on Ni/TiOg may also exist. The first step is rate determining and has a high activation energy; the second step is very 347 fast and its activation energy is low. The TPR spectra of the molecularly adsorbed CO takes the both steps into account, therefore revealing only the kinetics of the RDS step, which is first order in the adsorbed CO. But if the first step has been carried out in helium, such as was done in carbon hydrogenation experiments, the resultant TPR exhibits two peaks which should correspond to the two steps in a series reaction mechanism. To prove that the hydrogenation of adsorbed CO on Ni/SiOg proceeds via reaction paths similar to path d-c on Ni/TiOg, the mechanistic steps on Ni/SiOa are proposed as: 00(8) -^ I -*1^ CH4 d' c' where CO(S) denotes the carbon monoxide adsorbed on Ni/SiOg; the rate equations may be written as: ^-^.co. ^;=-(A<rCOs-M) (15) k^=D'exp(-Ea./RT) (16) k^=C'exp(-E,./RT) at T = To COs = COso I=Io the methane producing rate is: dCH4_,, dT (17) (18) (19) (20) If Io = 0, it is the hydrogenation TPR of pre-adsorbed CO on Ni/SiOg. If ID is not zero, it should represent cases where carbon has been pre-deposited on the catalyst. Equations (14)-(19) were also solved by computer integration and the results were fitted with experimental data. The data of the original TPR and the carbon hydrogenation experiments on Ni/SiOg were analyzed. As can be seen in Table 3, the fitted activation energies for paths d' and c' are approximately 78 kJ mol\"1 and 37 kJ mol~1, respectively. These values match well with the activation energies of paths d and c on Ni/TiOg. They also match the apparent activation energy for the hydrogenation of molecularly adsorbed CO on Ni/SiOa. From these results, it is clearly seen that the high temperature peak of Ni/TiOa exhibits the same behavior as the hydrogena- tion of CO on Ni/SiOg. Since on Ni/SiOa, no support interaction exists and the only reaction site is the nickel atom site, it occurs to us that peak B of 348 Ni/TiOz should be attributed to the site which is composed of pure nickel atoms. As for peak A, it should be the reaction site subjected to interactions with the TiOg support. Discussion Fujimoto et al. [37] have studied the TPR of pre-adsorbed CO on platinum group metal catalysts, and found that the peak temperature of TPR correlates well with the specific activities observed in steady-state kinetic studies. The specific activities of CO hydrogenation on nickel catalysts supported on different supports was reported to be in the sequence: Ni/Ti02> Ni/AlgOa > Ni/SiOa [21]. If we apply Fujimoto's correlation to compare the TPR spectra of Ni/TiOg and Ni/SiOg, the peak temperature of Ni/TiOg should be lower than that of Ni/SiOz. But obviously only peak A of Ni/TiOg is centered at a temperature lower than the peak of Ni/SiOg. Therefore the particular kinetic behavior, the high activity for CO hydroge- nation on Ni/TiOg should all be related to this reaction site. We shall try to explain the catalytic behavior of CO hydrogenation on Ni/TiOg from the viewpoint of this particular reaction site. For the SMSI effect of titania-supported nickel, Dumesic et al. [6-9, 12,14, 20, 22, 23] and other researchers [10,11,13,15-19,24,25] have found that nickel and titania interdiffuse in hydrogen atmosphere during reduction of the catalyst. This interdiffusion leads to migration of the partially reduced Ti0 species to the nickel surface and alters part of the nickel atoms [14,15,17,23-25]. We suspect that during reduction, a chemical bond may be created between the TiO^ species and the nickel atoms, thus forming a Ni TiO, site. Peak A found in the TPR of Ni/TiOg should be attributed to the hydrogenation of CO adsorbed on these TiO,:-altered nickel atoms, i.e. peak A is formed from the Ni Ti0 site. In the description presented above, it has been clearly shown that the intermediate I is the active carbon formed from CO dissociation. If peak A represents the hydrogenation of CO on the Ni TiO,. site, then path b in our model should correspond to the CO dissociation on this site. Computer simulation of our reaction model reveals that path b has an activation energy of about 45 kJ mol~1, much less than the activation energy of path d or d' (80kJmol~1), which is the dissociation of CO adsorbed on nickel sites on Ni/TiOg and Ni/SiOg respectively. During carbon hydrogenation experi- ments, it was also observed that when CO is pulsed through Ni/TiOg at high temperature, it is much easier to dissociate than on Ni/SiOg. Therefore it is suspected that this Ni TiO, site has the ability to easily dissociate the CO adsorbed on it. For CO hydrogenation on nickel catalysts, it has been suggested that the rate-determining step is the dissociation of carbon monoxide [27]. Therefore the catalyst which can break the carbon-oxygen bond most easily should give the highest CO hydrogenation rate. Since CO adsorbed on the 349 Ni TiO,. site is much easier to dissociate, the very possible reason for the high activity of CO hydrogenation on Ni/TiOg should be the existence of this reaction site. In recent adsorption studies on Ni/TiOz by high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy [24] and IR spectroscopy [25], it was found that a special tilted form of CO adsorption exists, characterized by an absorption frequency of 1850 cm\"1. This tilted form of CO adsorption was first proposed by Sachtler et al. [38,39] from the organometallic chemistry point of view, and later supported by a number of authors [10,24,25]. For this tilted bonded CO, it was suggested that both ends of the CO molecule are simultaneously activated when adsorbed, the carbon atom being attached to nickel while the oxygen is bonded to partially reduced TiOr. For this kind of adsorption to occur, nickel and titanium must be in close proximity to fulfill the geometric requirements. On Ni/TiOg, the only possible place for this kind of adsorption to occur is the Ni TiO^ sites. Since both carbon and oxygen are activated in this tilted form of adsorption, cleavage of the C 0 bond should be much easier than other forms of adsorption. From the ease of dissociation of CO on Ni TiQc, we suspect that CO on this site is adsorbed in this special form. One problem concerning this interpretation of high CO hydrogenation activity on Ni/TiOg is that the apparent activation energy obtained from steady state kinetics is about HOkJmol\"1, much higher than the 45kJmol~1 we observed from our model. But in our model, the reaction mechanism is in a parallel scheme: path b runs in parallel with the hydrogenation route d c on nickel site. Path b supplies additional carbon to the nearby nickel atoms, and therefore activity and possibly selectivity to the high-carbon hydrocarbons in CO hydrogenation is increased. For a parallel reaction scheme, the reaction path that is more sensitive to temperature variations, i.e. with higher activation energies, should be altered to a greater extent when temperature is changed and it contributes most to the apparent activation energy. But reaction paths with smaller E^, such as path b, would not be detected by the steady state kinetic study. The apparent activation energy of about HOkJ mol~1 for CO hydrogenation on nickel catalysts lies between the 2?a values of path a and path d. In other words, the main differences between TPR and the steady-state kinetic study is the unsteady surface coverage. Therefore the activation energies obtained from TPR all differ from the apparent E^ from the CO hydrogenation kinetic study. For the same reason, the apparent CO hydrogenation activation energy on Ni/SiOa, Ni/TiOg, and Ni/AlgOa are all nearly identical, which does not reveal the support effect. Conclusions (a) The temperature-programmed reaction of pre-adsorbed CO with hydrogen shows that two kinds of reaction sites on Ni/TiOg catalyst exist. 350 Comparison with the TPR on Ni/SiOg shows that one of these sites is composed of nickel atoms while the other corresponds to hydrogenation of CO on the reaction sites subjected to support interactions, which might be the Ni TiO^ site created from the migration of the partially reduced TiO,, species to the nickel surface during reduction. (b) Interaction between these two reaction sites occurs during hydro- genation. Experiments using interrupted techniques indicate the formation of a common intermediate. There are reaction pathways for CO on both reaction sites to be converted to this intermediate before hydrogenation to methane. (c) Comparison between carbon hydrogenation and interrupted experi- ments shows this intermediate exhibits the same behavior as the deposited surface carbons. Computer simulation of the TPR spectra indicates that the CO adsorbed on the TiO^ altered reaction sites is very easy to dissociate. This ease of dissociation could be the reason for high CO hydrogenation activity observed on Ni/TiOg. Acknowledgement The authors wish to thank Mr. H. K. Tsao for many helpful discussions and Mr. L.

The catalytic behaviors of Ni/TiO2 and Ni/SiO2 for CO hydrogenation were investigated using the temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) of pre-adsorbed carbon monoxide with hydrogen. The TPR spectra of Ni/SiO2 exhibits a single peak with the characteristic shape of first-order kinetics. In contrast, two distinct peaks are observed for Ni/TiO2, which indicates that there are two different reaction sites. The high temperature peak shows behavior similar to that of Ni/SiO2, and it is believed that the corresponding sites are composed of nickel atoms. The low temperature peak is attributed to the hydrogenation of CO adsorbed on Ni-TiO x sites. Some interrupted experiments indicate the formation of a common intermediate species from both reaction sites. Thus, a mechanistic model is proposed on the basis of experimental observation. Computer simulation of the TPR spectra shows that the model fits the system well. By comparison with carbon hydrogenation experiments, the intermediate is believed to be the active surface carbon. This mechanism satisfactorily explains the high activity of CO hydrogenation on Ni/TiO2 catalyst. References 1 S.J. Tauster S.C. Fung R.L. Garten J. Am. Chem. Soc. 100 1978 170 2 J.S. Smith P.A.

        "dc:description": "The catalytic behaviors of Ni/TiO2 and Ni/SiO2 for CO hydrogenation were investigated using the temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) of pre-adsorbed carbon monoxide with hydrogen. The TPR spectra of Ni/SiO2 exhibits a single peak with the characteristic shape of first-order kinetics. In contrast, two distinct peaks are observed for Ni/TiO2, which indicates that there are two different reaction sites. The high temperature peak shows behavior similar to that of Ni/SiO2, and it is believed that the corresponding sites are composed of nickel atoms. The low temperature peak is attributed to the hydrogenation of CO adsorbed on Ni-TiO x sites. Some interrupted experiments indicate the formation of a common intermediate species from both reaction sites. Thus, a mechanistic model is proposed on the basis of experimental observation. Computer simulation of the TPR spectra shows that the model fits the system well. By comparison with carbon hydrogenation experiments, the intermediate is believed to be the active surface carbon. This mechanism satisfactorily explains the high activity of CO hydrogenation on Ni/TiO2 catalyst.",
