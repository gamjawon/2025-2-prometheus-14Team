GROVE, GERARD VAN KOTEN* and AUGUSTINUS H. M. VERSCHUUREN Department of Metal Mediated Synthesis, Laboratory of Organic Chemistry, University of Utrecht, Padualaan 8, 3584 CH Utrecht (The Netherlands) (Received November 19,1987; accepted December 9,1987) The Karasch addition reaction of polyhalogenoalkanes to an alkene double bond, eqn. 1, is an important reaction of wide applicability that CX3Y + ^C=C^ > YXzC-C-C-X ., . X = halogen; Y = H, halogen, CPa or other electronegative group generates a new carbon-carbon bond and introduces synthetically useful halide substituents. This addition can be promoted by free radical-forming precursors, and is also amenable to catalysis by various metal complexes including CuX [I], mono- and dinuclear carbonyl species (e.g. [Cr(CO)3- (^-CloHs] [2], [Fe(CO)s] [3, 4] and [Fe^Hs^CC^L [5]), [RuCl^- (PPh3)3] [6, 7] and [IVDL^PPI^] (M = Ni, Pd) [6] as well as by the [Pd(OAc)2]/PPh3 system [8]. In contrast to the free radical-initiated reac- tion, which is liable to give telomers and polymers especially with activated alkenes, metal complex catalysis has the advantage of usually producing specifically a 1:1 alkene :halocarbon adduct. There are many applications of this reaction that are of industrial importance in the preparation of fine chemicals [I], and active research continues into the elucidation of the mechanisms operating in the various homogeneous metal-complex catalysed systems [9-13]. We now report that the square planar organonickel(II) amine species [Ni{C(,H3(CH2NMe2)2-o.o'}X] (la-c; X = Cl, Br, I) [14], Fig. 1, are very active homogeneous catalysts for the Karasch addition under remarkably mild conditions.

The addition of tetrachloromethane to methyl methacrylate in aceto- nitrile catalysed by less than 0.1 mol% of la (relative to alkene) affords the 1:1 adduet CCl3CH2CCl(Me)C02Me (eqn. 2a) in high yield with 100% regio- specificity. A plot of percentage alkene conversion against time for a typical experiment employing 50 vol.% CHaCN and 0.075 mol% of la at 30 C (Fig, 2) provides a turnover number of more than 500 h~1 for the first hour of reaction, with a total turnover number of 950 being achieved within 4 h. With 0.052 mol% of la, total turnover numbers in excess of 1700 have been obtained after 72 h at 25 C. The excellent activity of this organometallic species is further demonstrated by the fact that even at 0 C (using an alkene:la molar ratio of 120:1) catalytic conversion to the 1:1 adduet, though slow, was still found. The good catalytic reactivity and specificity of la also applies to the 1:1 addition of CBr4 and CF3CC13 to methyl metha- crylate, eqns. 2b and 2c. Furthermore, complexes 1 are effective catalysts for the 1:1 addition of CCl4, CBr4 and CFaCCIa to the non-activated terminal double bond of hept-1-ene, eqns. 3a-c.

The percentage conversion of methyl methacrylate to 1:1 adduct with CCl4 at 30 C as a function of time for two different CH3CN/CC14 ratios. Reaction conditions: 5 ml (46.8 mmol) methyl methacrylate, 10 mg (3.5 X 10~2 mmol) la, 25 ml CHaCN + CCl4. 100% conversion corresponds to a total turnover number of 1337 per molecule la. turnover numbers of 50 or more are readily obtained within a few hours under mild conditions and 1:1 adduct formation occurs with good regio- specificity (see Table 1). 172 The above results show that la has a catalytic reactivity that is superior to that of [RuCl2(PPh3)3] [7], which is reported to be inactive below 40 C [8], and more than comparable to that of [Pd(OAc)2]/PPh3 the catalyst system reported to be the most active for the addition of CC4 to alkenes [8]. To determine the principle factors influencing the catalytic reactivity of our new system, various experiments have been carried out. For the CCl4/methyl methacrylate/C^CN/la case, the effect of the CHaCN/CC^ ratio on the percentage alkene conversion has been studied at 30 C. Figure 3, which presents results after 105 min and 22 h reaction time, shows that optimal conversion rates are obtained with ca. 55 - 70 vol.% C^CN. A plot with a similar form was reported by Gandolfi and Cats on studying the effect of THF on the addition of CC4 to norbornadiene with naphthalene- chromiumtricarbonyl as catalyst [2]. 0 20 1.0 60 80 100 vol% CH3CN Fig. 3. The percentage conversion of methyl methacrylate to 1:1 adduct with CCl4 at 30 C as a function of vol.% CH3CN monitored at two different times. Reaction condi- tions as for Fig. 2. In our system, although the initial rate of 1:1 adduct formation is dependent on the percentage of CH3CN present, see Fig. 2, the final conver- sion of alkene to adduct (t > 22 h) is independent of this in the range 0 - 70 vol.% CH3CN. Above 70 vol.% CH3CN, where the CCL^alkene ratio falls below 2:1 the final yield of adduct begins to drop rapidly. Note that CH3CN is not essential for catalysis; in its absence, although the initial rate of adduct formation is somewhat lower (Fig. 2), the final percentage conversion is 173 appreciable. Under these latter conditions there is a noticeable induction period of several minutes, and it is possible that the role of the CH3CN donor solvent in the initiation process is taken over by traces of moisture. Apart from CH3CN, other polar (donor) compounds such as diethyl ether, THF and pyridine are also satisfactory solvents for the catalysed 1:1 addition of CC4 to methyl methacrylate. It is not surprising, therefore, that the presence in the system of added water (in which species 1 are soluble without decomposition [14]) does not prevent catalysis. The order of activity of the new Ni(II) catalysts in the addition of CC4 to methyl methacrylate is la > Ib > Ic. The important role being played by the halide (X) of the catalyst is emphasised by the fact that the ionic species [Ni{C6H3(CH2NMe2)2-o,o1} (CH3CN)] BF4 does not exhibit catalytic activity. When catalysis using la appears to be finished, solvated organonickel(III) species [15] (identified by UV/visible and ESR spectro- scopic measurements) are present in the reaction medium. However, sepa- rate experiments have shown that the neutral Ni(III) complexes [Ni{C6H3- (CH2NMe2)2-o,o'}Br2] [15, 16] does not exhibit catalytic activity for the addition reaction of eqn. 1 under the conditions used for la in Table 1. Several aspects of the catalysis using complexes 1 point to the absence of free radicals in the bulk solution; there is no telomer formation, added galvinoxyl does not inhibit catalysis, and no cross-products are formed if a mixture of CCl4 and CBr4 is used. The operative mechanism is therefore likely to be one primarily based on intimate metal-centered reactions, as proposed for systems containing Cu(I) species [1, 13, 17] and [RuCl2- (PPh3)3] [II], that can cycle the metal center between Ni(II) and Ni(III) oxidation states. Although details of this type of catalytic cycle require clarification, the involvement of carbon-centered radicals is almost certain. It is remarkable, therefore, that the organonickel species 1 can promote this type of addition reaction and at the same time still retain the potentially reactive Ni^-C o-bond. Since the phosphine complexes [NiX2(PPh3)2] (X = Cl, Br) have only limited activity in promoting the Karasch addition [7], we propose that the most important factor determining the electronic, chemical and catalytic properties of the Ni(II) centers in la-c is the trans N-donor arrangement of the terdentate mono-anionic C6H3(CH2NMe2)2-o,o' ligand. In particular this leads to the remarkably low Ni(II)/Ni(III) redox couple of +0.14 V (us. SCE) for aqueous 1 (cf. Cu(I)/Cu(II), 0.08 V). It is worth mentioning here that a nickel(II) species with a different terdentate ligand providing a trans N-donor arrangement is reported to be an effective homogeneous catalyst in the water-gas shift reaction [18]. Our discovery that species 1 (with N-donor rather than carbonyl or phosphine ligands) are efficient homogeneous catalysts is a significant development which should lead to more interest being paid to the properties and applications of similar organometallic amine complexes. Moreover, in la-c the specific, fairly rigid, N,C,N-tridentate chelation of the ligand to the metal and the consequent geometric restriction(s) imposed on the active 174 catalytic site(s) make these complexes well suited for future mechanistic investigations. Work in this and other areas of catalysis using derivatives and analogues of 1 is in progress. References 1 D. Bellus, Pure Appl. Chem., (1986) 1827 and references therein. 2 0. Gandolfi and M.
