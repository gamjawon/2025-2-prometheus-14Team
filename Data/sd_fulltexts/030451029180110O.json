B. McGarvey and J. B. Moffat* Department of Chemistry and Guelph-Waterloo Centre for Graduate Work in Chemistry, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ont. N2L 3G1 (Canada) (Received January 28, 1991; accepted May 14, 1991) Abstract Solutions containing heteropoly acids possessing the catalytically active Keggin anion and solutions of heteropoly acid precursors have been studied over the pH range 0-12 using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (1R) spectroscopy. 3'P NMR spectra have been recorded for vanadate-phosphate, chromate-phosphate, molybdate-phosphate and tungstate-phosphate solutions. The tungstate-phosphate system was further characterized using '8W NMR. The formation and decomposition of the 12-molybdophosphate and 12-tungstophosphate anions proceed through several species as the pH of the solution is changed. Similar behaviour was not observed for vanadate-phosphate or chromate-phosphate system. No evidence was observed for the formation of the Keggin anion when solutions containing molybdate and either pyrophosphate or phosphite ions were studied. Introduction In recent years there has been a great deal of interest in the application of heteropoly oxometalates as homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts [1-6]. The compounds which have attracted the greatest interest are those which possess the Keggin-type anion. The structure of the anion consists of a metal atom (usually P, Si or As) at the centre of a tetrahedron of oxygen atoms. This tetrahedron is surrounded by twelve octahedra of oxygen atoms which have a peripheral metal atom at their centres (usually W, Mo, V). Keggin-type anions possess three different types of oxygen atoms; those bridging the central metal atom to the peripheral metal, those connecting two peripheral metal atoms, and terminal oxygen atoms which bond to only one peripheral metal atom. It has been proposed that the oxygen atoms in 12-tungstophosphoric acid (H3PW1204o, hereafter referred to as HPW) are involved in the methanol dehydration and subsequent carbon chain growth mechanism [7]. The oxidation of acrolein over various 12-molybdophosphates has been proposed to follow a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism that involves the external bridging oxygen atoms of the anion [lc]. Evidently the structure of the Keggin anion plays an important role in the aforementioned processes. `Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/91/$3.50 0 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 138 The catalytic activity of 12-heteropoly compounds depends to a large degree upon the elements which comprise the anion. Compounds containing tungsten peripheral metal atoms and either phosphorus or silicon central metal atoms ~Lre effective catalysts for the methanol to hydrocarbon process [6, 8-111. Those catalysts with molybdenum peripheral metal atoms are active and selective both in oxidations of aldehydes [1, 2, 121 and in the partial oxidation of methane [4, 131. Dimeric heteropoly acids (the 9-series) did not exhibit the same catalytic activity towards the conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons, indicating that for the reactions considered to date the Keggin anion is unique among heteropoly oxometalates [81. The formation of Keggin atoms is accomplished by the acidification of a solution of the central metal atom and peripheral metal atom as tetrahedral species (for example the acidification of one equivalent of HP04 2- and twelve equivalents of Mo042- to generate 12-molybdophosphoric acid (H3PMo12040, hereafter referred to as HPMo). There are, however, heteropoly and isopoly species formed that do not possess the Keggin anion as the solution is acidified [ 141. Since there is usually an overlap in the region of stability for the various species, one must be concerned with the homogeneity of the solution from which a particular species is extracted. One of the most powerful tools for studying heteropoly and isopoly oxometalates in solution is multinuclear, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The study of such nuclei as l'O [ 151, 51V [ 16, 171, '5As [ 181, 183W [ 19-21 ] and 31P [ 16, 22-271 has yielded extensive information with regard to both the identification and the structure of species containing such nuclei. The differences in chemical shifts for heteropoly species are a function of the shielding of. the nucleus in a particular environment. In general these differences are sufficiently large to distinguish between species quite readily when mixtures of these are present. Most recently 3'P NMR has been employed in a novel method for the examination of the stability of the heteropoly anions of Keggin structure [281. Using this technique it was possible to study the exchange of tungsten and molybdenum peripheral atoms between discrete Keggin anions in aqueous solution. The present work was undertaken to examine the nature of the formation and destruction process of the Keggin anion, particularly as a function of pH. The products formed as the HPMo and HPW were mixed with sodium hydroxide were also investigated. In order to observe the applicability of the technique and compare the aforementioned systems with those, that have not been reported to form the 12-Keggin type anion, four other systems were also studied by 31P NMR spectroscopy. Mixtures of HP04 2 _-Cr04 2 ,HPO42 -VOq3 , P2074 -Mo042 and HP03 2 -Mo042 were studied at different pHs. Reports of a bicapped Keggin structure containing vanadium species have been made [22, 241 but not for the `uncapped' species. Since, in addition, no heteropoly compound with twelve chromium peripheral metal atoms and one phosphorus central metal atom has been reported, these systems were also investigated for comparison with the tungstophosphate and molybdophosphate systems. The pyrophosphate-molybdate and phos- 139 phite-molybdate systems were investigated to observe the species generated when phosphorus species other than simple orthophosphates were present. '83W NMR spectroscopy was used to obtain additional information concerning the tungstate-phosphate system. The present work should complement the recent contributions of Schwegler et al. [28] to the study of the heteropoly oxometalates with solution NMR. Infrared spectroscopy is another important technique in the study of heteropoly oxometalates. The 12-Keggin anion has been studied extensively for compounds that possess a variety of central and peripheral metal atoms [29-31 ]. In addition, there have been compilations of data for the 11-`defect' Keggin anions in which one peripheral metal octahedron has been removed [32, 33] and the P2Mo50238- species [34]. It was hoped that these complementary techniques would lead to more definitive identification of the species present. Experimental Materials 12-Tungstophosphoric acid (BDH, AnalaR) and 12-molybdophosphoric acid (BDH, AnalaR) were recrystallized prior to use. All inorganic salts and acids were used without further purification. Methods The tungstate-orthophosphate and molybdate-orthophosphate systems were prepared using two different methods. The first method involved preparing a series of solutions which contained the orthophosphate and tungstate (molybdate) anions in 1:12 molar ratios at a concentration of 0.05 M. The pH of the various solutions was adjusted with HCl and measured using a pH meter with a glass electrode. The second method involved the preparation of solutions which initially contained H3PW12040 Or H3PM012040 (0.04 M) and the subsequent adjustment of the pH by addition of 4 M NaOH. No attempts were made to maintain constant ionic strength for the solutions. Sample pH was monitored until no apparent changes were observable. Samples were generally prepared on the day prior to NMR analysis and were usually analyzed within 24-36 h of preparation. The vanadate-phosphate, chromate-phosphate, molybdate-phosphite and molybdate- pyrophosphate systems were prepared with metal:phosphorus molar ratios of 12:1 and a concentration of 0.05 M. Solution pH was again adjusted using the addition of HCl. NMR spectroscopy All NMR spectra were obtained using pulsed Fourier transform methods. Deuterium lock signals were provided by the D20 (Merck, Sharp and Dohme) solvent. All measurements were made in 10 mm spinning tubes (Wilmad512-1 PP) at ambient probe temperature (- 300 K). Spectra were obtained 140 on either a Bruker AM-250 or a Bruker AC-200 spectrometer. Chemical shifts were measured relative to external standards. 31P NMR At 101.25 MHz the spectra were obtained on the Bruker AM 250 NMR spectrometer using an 18 us pulse. At 81.02 MHz the spectra were obtained on the Bruker AC 200 NMR spectrometer using a 14 its pulse. All chemical shifts were measured relative .to external 85ss'o H3P09. 183W NMR At 10.42 MHz the spectra were obtained on the Bruker AM 250 NMR spectrometer equipped with the broadband probe from the AC 200 spectrometer. This was necessary to attain the required carrier frequency. A 90 pulse of 65 As (measured for 0.8 M H4S'WIZ040) was used for all samples. Chemical shifts were measured relative to 2 M Na2W04. A secondary standard of 0.8 M H4SiW12040 was run immediately following each sample to account for any magnetic field drift. Infrared spectroscopy Infrared spectra were recorded for solid samples which were obtained after evaporation of the water from samples of different pH. No attempts were made to selectively crystallize specific species out of solution, as it was believed that the heterogeneous nature of the solutions for the NMR studies would be more accurately represented if all species present were also observed by IR spectroscopy. All spectra were obtained on a Perkin Elmer model 983 using KBr disks. Results Molybdate phosphate system 3IP NMR spectra were recorded for acidified phosphate-molybdate, P:Mo=1:12,, solutions and for HPMo and the species that were generated following the addition of sodium hydroxide to the solutions. The chemical shift data., for these systems are given in Table 1. Mgure 1 shows a series of spectra that were recorded for HPMo and species produced following sodium hydroxide addition. The spectra recorded in the intermediate pH range display several peaks, indicative of the presence of several different solution species. The peak at approximately - 3.1 ppm has been attributed to the PM012040 3 species [24, 261. The chemical shift of this species shows a small dependence upon the solution pH. HPMo exists as the major solution species in solutions of pH < 1.5, but the existence of other species can also be seen. The peak at -1.2 ppm at pH = 2 has previously been assigned to PMo110397 [26]. The chen-deal shift has a fairly strong pH dependence between pH 2 and 5, as was previously observed [26, 271. A recent Raman 141 TABLE i 3'P chemical shifts for molybdate-phosphate solutions pH Chemical shift (PP-) 0.9 1.5 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.1 7.0 8.0 10.0 - 3.05 -1.14 -1.17 -1.06 0.53 1.93 2.1 2.71 3.26 3.46 - 0.78 0.48 -0.69 4 os,Ana 1.2 ~.s 1.9 i ~w.~,.w w, 3.4 \"WMN~Mr,MApP 4.3 4.7 5E 11.4 pH 6 4 2 0 -2 -4 o/ppm Fig. 1. \"P NMR spectra recorded for molybdophosphate solutions of various pH. spectroscopic study of the formation of the PM012040 3 anion suggests that PM011037 3- is generated as an intermediate [35]. Conceivably, this resonance peak could also be assigned to this species. There was no evidence for resonance peaks at - 0.85 or - 2.4 ppm which correspond to PMo903i(OH)3sand the PZMo18062g- dieter respectively. These species are readily observed in solutions with P:Mo ratios of 1:9, the former existing over the pH range 4 to - 0.5 [ 26, 27 ]. The dieter peak was observed for solutions of pH < 2.2. 142 This is to be expected, as PMo9031(OH)36- dimerizes in acidic media. The peak at - 2 ppm in solutions of pH between 5 and 7 has been assigned to P2M060236- [26, 271. This peak shifts upfield as the pH decreases and is not observed below pH 5. The peak at - 0.5 ppm in solutions of pH 4 and 5 has not been positively identified. It has been proposed that it could be due to a PM060269- species [261, but no previous characterization data are presently available. Of the solution species observed in the study of the molybdophosphate system, the PM0120403 and P2MO50236- anions have been characterized crystallographically [36, 37]. Complementary IR spectra were also recorded for samples of the solutions that had been taken to dryness. Figure 2 shows a series of IR spectra for acidified molybdate-phosphate mixtures and Table 2 lists the major stretching and bending frequencies. The spectra recorded for samples at low pH possess the vibrational bands that characterize the Keggin anion. Specifically, those bands at approximately 1065, 960, 870 and 785 cm ''are used as fingerprints 1 D c d e f 2000 1500 1000 500 (cm 1) Fig. 2.

These bands are observed up to pH 2, after which the 1065 cm-' band splits into two bands at approximately 1063 and 1035 cm-1. The bands present in this spectrum are consistent with those of the PM011039 '- anion reported previously [32, 33]. At pH 5 the IR spectrum undergoes further change and bands at - 1120 and 1055 cm- 1 appear. These bands, as well as those at ~ 985, 895 and 565 cm-1, have been observed previously for the PZMO50236- anion using IR spectroscopy [34]. A vibrational spectroscopic study using Raman spectroscopy reports the formation Of Mo70248- from PMO11039'- at pH 5.6 [381. A definite assignment of this species could not be made in this particular study, possibly due to the fact that the IR spectra were recorded for mixtures of species. If the absorptions for the heptamolybdate vibrations are weak they may be masked by other stronger bands. Tungstate phosphate system 31P NMR spectra were recorded for tungstate-phosphate solutions over the pH range 0.4 to 11.2 for 1:12 mixtures of phosphate:tungstate and for solutions containing HPW and sodium hydroxide. The chemical shift data are shown in Table 3. A series of spectra collected from solutions of HPW and the species generated following the addition of base are shown in Fig. 3. It is evident from Table 3 and Fig. 3 that the most complex spectra are obtained at 1.0 < pH <_ 4.0. At pH > 8, a single peak at - 3.5 ppm attributed to the free phosphate ion in the solution can be observed. Solutions with pH < 8 exhibit a single peak at -10.1 ppm. This upfield shift of - 13 ppm indicates a large perturbation in the local phosphorus environment associated with the condensation of a heteropoly species. This peak has been assigned to PWI10397[241 which 144 TABLE 3 3'P chemical shifts for tungstate-phosphate solutions pH Chemical shift (PPm) 0.9 0.6 -14.5 1.1 -14.5 -13.2 -12.9 -12.3 -11.8 1.5 -14.5 -12.9 -12.4 -11.7 -11.5 2.0 -13.5 -13.0 -12.3 -11.5 -11.0 -10.7 2.5 - 10.5 3.1 - 10.2 4.0 -10.1 5.2 -10.1 6.0 -10.1 7.0 -10.1 8.0 3.2 9.2 3.5 10.2 3.5 is a known decomposition product of the PW12040 3- anion and precursor to its formation that possesses a wide pH stability range [39]. The PW110397 anion exists as the major species down to pH - 2.0. Its chemical shift displays a pH dependence between pH 3.5 and 2 probably associated with its susceptibility to conversion to PW120403-. Pope reports that further acidification of PW11039'- can lead to PW12040 3 and/or PZWz10716 formation [39]. The peak at -14.4 ppm is assigned to the former and that at -12.8 ppm to the latter [241. The peak assigned to PZW210716- finally disappears below pH 1. In the pH range less than 1.5 the PW120403- resonance becomes the major peak. This is in agreement with the proposed mechanism for the reversible decomposition of the PW12040 anion at pH 1.5-2 [39]. Both the PW12040 - and PW110397- anions have been characterized crystallographically [40, 41 ]. In the pH range 1.5-3.0 there are species present other than those previously mentioned. These species have not been positively identified but may be part of the P2W1$ or PZWl9 series, as these species have been observed in acidic media [39]. 183W NMR spectra were recorded for 12-tungstophosphoric acid and solutions for which the pH had been raised to 4.0, 5.4 and 7.1 (Mg. 4). Spectra were also recorded for sodium tungstate-sodium phosphate mixtures of pH 7.0 and 5.0. The chemical shifts and 2J(P-O-W) coupling constants axe given in Table 4. The spectra recorded at pH 4, 5.4 and 7.1 are consistent with those previously published for the PWl1039' anion [421. In addition, the spectrum recorded at pH 4 displays resonance peaks at -121.2, -126.0, -146.0 and -182.6 ppm. The two peaks further up-field were narrow doublets, indicating that the tungsten atoms are part of a tungstophosphate complex. These upfield peaks are not observed in the spectra recorded at pH 5.4 or 7.1. The two downfield peaks are observed but their intensities are greatly reduced. 145 OA 0.8 1.5 rl~1'MIW~f 2.0 `~2.5 3.0 .M 3.6 'r'~4.3 ..ww,.~..~ rnivw 5.7 6.7 75 pH 0 -4 -8 -12 -16 8/PPM Fig. 3. 3'P NO spectra obtained for 12-tungstophosphoric acid and the species generated as a result of addition of sodium hydroxide. The 18'7V NMR spectra recorded for the sodium tungstate-sodium phosphate mixture are also consistent with the sodium salt of the PWI1039 7 anion. There is no evidence in these spectra of the presence of any unexpected resonance peaks. IR spectroscopy also confirms the transition between the PW120403 and PWI1039 3 (Table 5). The bands associated with the Keggin anion [29-31 at 1080 and 980 cm-1 undergo modification as the pH is raised. The 1080 cm-1 band splits into two bands and the 980 cm-1 disappears as a band at - 950 cm-1 appears. This pattern, consistent with the PW11039' anion [31, 32], exists up to pH 7 but at higher pH the IR spectra undergo an additional change. The pH at which the species undergo structural changes agrees quite well with NMR data concerning the major solution species. 146 c) b) a) ILL -100 8/ ppm -150 leg. 4. 183W NMR spectra for tungstophosphate solutions at pH (a) 4.0, (b) 5.4 and (c) 7.1: T= 304 K, concentration - 0.6 M. Chromate phosphate and vanadate phosphate systems NMR spectra were recorded for solutions containing sodium phosphate and either sodium chromate or sodium (ortho) vanadate. The 31P chemical shifts are collected in Table 6. For reasons of either size and/or electron configuration, no examples of 12-heteropoly anions with the Keggin structure have been reported which contain Crg+ as the peripheral metal. Spectra were however recorded for 1:12 mixtures of phosphate: chromate. At pH 7.4 there was a single peak, probably due to free phosphate. Following acidification, the spectra showed two peaks over the pH range 6-2.8. At a pH of 2 a broad series of four peaks was observed, indicating that some sort of complexation is occurring. Between pH 1 and 0.5 only a single peak (full width at half maximum - 250 Hz) was observed. At pH = 0 a single narrow peak was observed that indicates that any complexes that had been formed have possibly decomposed because of some hydrolysis process. IR spectra were recorded for chromate-phosphate mixtures at various pH values. The frequencies for the transitions are shown in Table 7. At pH = 7.4 the spectrum is dominated by a broad absorption at 1086 cm-1 pH 147 TABLE 4 '83W NMR chemical shifts for tungstophosphate solutions S (2J(P-0-W) (Hz) 4.0' -100.3 (d, 0.5) -105.4 (d, 1.7) -112.3 (d, 2.0) -119.9 (d, 2.0) -125.0 -135.2 (d, 1.2) -146.2 (d, 0.7) -156.0 (d, 1.1) -182.6 (1.5) 5.4` -100.0 (d, 0.7) -105.2 (d, 2.0) - 112.0 (d, 2.1) -119.6 (d, 2.0) -135.1 (d, 1.0) - 155.0 (d, 1.0) 7.1' -100.4 (d, 0.7) -103.6 -105.4 (d, 1.7) -112.4 (- 2.0) -119.9 (d, 1.7) -135.4 (d, 1.2) -156.2 (d, 1.2) 7.Ob -100.0 (d, 1.0) -104.9 (d, 1.5) -112.0 (d, 2.0) -119.4 (d, 1.5) -135.0 (d, 1.5) -155.8 (d, 1.0) 5.Ob -100.4 (d, 1.0) -105.3 (d, 1.4) -112.2 (d, 2.4) -119.9 (d, 2.0 -135.5 (d, 1.0) -156.1 (d, 1.0) H3F \"12040 (0.8 M) - 99.4 (d, 1.0) H481~V12Oap (0.8 M) -104.1 'Sodium hydroxide added to H3PW,204o (0.5 M). bConc.

For samples between pH 6.3 and 2.1, the IR. spectra remained essentially unchanged. Once again the 1086 cm-1 absorption is present but the 947 and 886 cm-1 transitions have changed. The 947 cm-1 band has become more intense and has split into two sharp bands of decreased intensity. Two bands at 776 and 800 cm- I appear in this pH range which were not present at the more basic pH. Although positive assignments to species present cannot be made there is reasonably good agreement between the IR and the NMR spectra. The vanadate-phosphate system was also investigated by NMR spec- troscopy and the chemical shifts are recorded in Table 6. The NMR spectra agree quite well with the type of pH dependence observed previously [22]. 148 TABLE 6 3'P chemical shifts for chromate-phosphate and vanadate-phosphate solutions pH Chemical shift (pp-) (a) chromatephosphate 7.4 3.70 6.0 4.26 2.53 4.8 4.03 1.64 4.0 3.75 1.36 2.8 3.73 1.46 2.0 6.41 4.97 3.43 1.58 1.0 2.73 0.5 2.73 0 0.24 (b) vanaOte phosphate 12.5 6.34 8.0 2.84 6.8 2.75 6.1 2.45 0.07 5.1 1.83 0.18 4.0 1.20 0.52 3.0 1.17 0.68 2.0 1.10 0.82 1.0 3.76 1.54 0.89 0.5 0.85 The chemical shifts are shifted upfield slightly from those previously recorded. This may be the result of the P:V ratio difference, overall concentration difference or the fact that `ortho'vanadate was used in this study and `meta'vanadate in the previous study. It does appear however, that the PV14042 7 species was generated although the existence of two resonance peaks indicates that some free phosphate remains in the solution. IR spectra were recorded for phosphate-vanadate solutions over the pH range studied using 31P NMR spectroscopy. Bands at approximately 1055, 980 and 950 cm-' were observed over the pH range 5.1-2.4 which is the range in which the 3'P NMR peaks attributed to the PV14042 ' anion were observed (Table 7). The band at - 1055 cm-' has been assigned to the asymmetric stretch of the central phosphate unit [24]. This anion has been isolated as the guanidinium salt and its structure determined by X-ray crystallography [ 22) . Molybdate phosphite and molybdate-pyrophosphate systems For comparative purposes, solutions containing sodium molybdate and potassium pyrophosphate at different pH values were also studied using 31P NMR to investigate the ability of the Keggin structure to be formed from the diphosphate anion on which the formal charge is + 5.

The positions of the resonance peaks do not resemble the patterns of peaks that were obtained for the orthophosphate-molybdate system (Table 1). The chemical shift of the system at pH 9.6 is in fairly good agreement with Crutchfield's values for free P207'- [43]. This indicates that there is no interaction or complexation between the pyrophosphate and molybdate. A study of the interaction of Mo(V) with pyrophosphate, (P:Mo=1:1) showed 3'P NMR spectra with several resonance peaks [441. These peaks were assigned to paramagnetic species with unestablished structures. Even at high pH values there are species that possess chemical shifts upfield from that of HPMo, indicating that the phosphorus is more shielded than that in the Keggin anion. At low pH values the shift is even more dramatic. Solutions containing sodium molybdate and sodium phosphite were also studied. Phosphorus has a formal charge of + 3 in the phosphite ion and it was of interest to determine whether the Keggin unit could form from a non-phosphate type of phosphorus. A 1:12 (P:Mo) mixture of sodium phosphite and sodium molybdate has a pH of 8.7 and the NMR spectrum shows two peaks (Table 9). The peak at 3.5 ppm can be assigned to free phosphite ion [451, while that at approximately 9 ppm may be the result of some complex formation. Following acidification to pH 6 the spectrum had ten peaks, most of which were downfield from the original resonance peaks. Once again, no correspondence was observed between this system and the HPMo system.

Discussion NMR spectroscopy has long been known as a powerful method for investigating polyanion structure. This study has investigated the formation and decomposition of the t2-molybdophosphate and 12-tungstophosphate anions. In both cases there was a very strong dependence on pH with regard to the major species present in solution. Figure 5 and 6 show the pH dependence of the major species present in the solutions for the tungstate-phosphate and molybdate-phosphate systems respectively. In both systems there axe three `plateau' regions, indicating that the formation or decomposition proceeds through three major steps.

Plot of the 3'P NO chemical shifts of the major species present in molybdophosphate solutions as a function of pH. system appears to undergo a labile reaction to form PWIIO3s' from free W042- and HP042- between pH 8 and 7.5. This single species exists in solutions down to pH-2.5. Between pH 2.5 and 1.0, several NMR peaks are observed in addition to those associated with PWI10397 and PW120403-. The peak at - -12.8 ppm is assigned to the P2W210716 anion that is known to be stable in acidic solution [39]. This species exists until pH 1 at which time it disappears. The direct conversion to the PW12040 3 anion seems unlikely, a more probable explanation being decomposition to the PW11039 ' anion which could then form PWIZ04 3-. The use of I83'W NMR confirms the existence of the PWI10397 anion over the pH range 7.5-2.5. Its labile formation indicates that it can be prepared either from the parent 12-tungstophosphate or the phosphate and tungstate precursors with equal ease with apparently no chance of contamination from other heteropoly and isopoly species. This aspect of the solution chemistry of heteropoly oxometalates may have important ramifications in modifications of the catalytic properties of the Keggin anion by substitution of a single peripheral metal atom. It also becomes apparent that there is added flexibility available in such reactions, since the starting material can be either the parent acid or the.simple inorganic salt. The minor peaks that were present but not unambiguously identified serve to show the complicated formation and decomposition mechanisms that occur, especially at low pH. Solutions containing sodium molybdate and sodium phosphite were studied using 31P NMR to investigate whether the Keggin anion could be formed from a phosphorus-containing species where the formal charge on phosphorus is -1- 3. This system was first studied by Rosenheim and Shapiro [46]; more recent investigations indicate that the family of compounds of formula (RP)ZMo50214 - are structurally related to the PZMo50236- anion [47-50]. These heteropoly compounds have the phosphonate groups spanning both sides of a five-membered ring of MOO6 units. The downfield shifts of the molybdate-phosphite complexes are consistent with the previously observed structures [51 ]. The phosphorus atom can be considered as bare in this type of structure, as the phosphite group is not surrounded by molybdate units. A recent investigation of the H+-MO092--C6H5P032- system has proposed the existence of PM07 and PM06 complexes from 31P NMR measurements and potentiometry [49]. Conceivably, in the present system such species could also exist in which the phenyl ring is replaced by H. The sodium molybdate-potassium pyrophosphate system was studied to investigate the ability of the Keggin structure to be formed from the diphosphate anion in which the formal charge on phosphorus is + 5. The formation of heteropoly complexes resulting from the interaction of molybdate with phosphate esters and nucleotides has been reported [51 ]. This work reported a pyrophosphate-molybdate complex that is believed to possess the same P2M05 type of structure as the phosphonate complexes, based on similarities between the IR spectra of the two families of compounds. The 31P chemical 153 shifts for the molybdate-pyrophosphate complexes differ greatly from the corresponding phosphite complexes (Tables 8 and 9). In addition, the general appearance of the two sets of spectra are very distinct. This could be a result of the fact that pyrophosphate can undergo molybdenum-catalyzed hydrolysis [52], which would yield another solution species capable of interacting with isomolybdate ions. It also seems plausible that larger molybdopyrophosphate structures could be formed if two Mo05 ring units were to interact with a single pyrophosphate anion. This could possibly explain the significant upfield shifts in the a1P resonances which indicate that the phosphorus is more highly shielded than in the Keggin anion. The formation and degradation of the PM012040 anion also appears to proceed through three major species as shown in Fig. 6. In solutions of pH > 5 the PZMo50236- species is present as indicated by the NMR peak at - 2 ppm. This species disappears below pH = 5 and PMo1103s' becomes the predominant species (8^- -2 ppm). PMo11039' is known [26] to be the precursor to PM012040 3 formation and the two species coexist until the pH is lowered to 1.5. The III spectra of the species at different pH values confirm the presence of the major components of the solution, but the minor species could not be observed, partly as a consequence of the strong overlap of absorption bands. Despite their relative proximity in the Periodic Table, the chromate and vanadate behave much differently than molybdate and tungstate with regard to heteropoly oxometalate formation. The vanadate-phosphate system apparently forms only a single condensed species, which appears to be much less hydrolytically stable in strongly acidic media than the molybdophosphate and tungstophosphate species. Likewise, the chromate-phosphate system shows evidence for complex formation that does not resemble the stepwise formation mechanism followed by the tungstophosphate and molybdophosphate systems. The presence of plateaus in the chemical shift versus pH plots is not observed for the vanadate or chromate systems, suggesting that the number of heteropoly oxometalates that can be generated with these peripheral metals is small.

Solutions containing heteropoly acids possessing the catalytically active Keggin anion and solutions of heteropoly acid precursors have been studied over the pH range 0–12 using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. 31P NMR spectra have been recorded for vanadate-phosphate, chromate-phosphate, molybdate-phosphate and tungstate-phosphate solutions. The tungstate-phosphate system was further characterized using 183W NMR. The formation and decomposition of the 12-molybdophosphate and 12-tungstophosphate anions proceed through several species as the pH of the solution is changed. Similar behaviour was not observed for vanadate-phosphate or chromate-phosphate system. No evidence was observed for the formation of the Keggin anion when solutions containing molybdate and either pyrophosphate or phosphite ions were studied. References 1 (a) J.B. Black N.J.

        "dc:description": "Solutions containing heteropoly acids possessing the catalytically active Keggin anion and solutions of heteropoly acid precursors have been studied over the pH range 0–12 using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. 31P NMR spectra have been recorded for vanadate-phosphate, chromate-phosphate, molybdate-phosphate and tungstate-phosphate solutions. The tungstate-phosphate system was further characterized using 183W NMR. The formation and decomposition of the 12-molybdophosphate and 12-tungstophosphate anions proceed through several species as the pH of the solution is changed. Similar behaviour was not observed for vanadate-phosphate or chromate-phosphate system. No evidence was observed for the formation of the Keggin anion when solutions containing molybdate and either pyrophosphate or phosphite ions were studied.",
