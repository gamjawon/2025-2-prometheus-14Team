Of these one-component catalysts, tungsten derivatives are generally superior to those of molybdenum. Phosphine complexes are poor catalysts, but W(CO)3X2(AsPh3)2 compounds exhibit fair catalytic activity at 353 K. The catalytic activity is retained in the presence of air and moisture. The polymers produced from norbornene are moderately high-ci's structure and somewhat blocky with respect to cis/trans distribution. The solvent generally has little effect on the polymer yield. However there was no polymerization in nitrobenzene, a large quantity of ethyl acrylate quenched the reaction and in CCl4 solutions saturated chlorinated telomers were formed exclusively. Steric crowding at the metal centre caused by coordinating molecules, such as CO, alcohol, or even olefins, generally results in increased blockiness for the polymer. A non-cage-like 'three-ligand sequence', i.e. the simultaneous involv- ment of at least three coordination sites in the coordination sphere of the propagating species, is proposed to explain the experimental results. The catalysts are surprisingly tolerant towards alcohol and water. Both additives increase the cis/trans selectivity of the catalysts and the blockiness of the polymer. However, the addition of EtOH results in high-ci's polymer with the main effect in r,,, while water results in high-traras polymer with the main effect in r^. Introduction The complexes M(CO)3X2L2 (M = Mo or W, X = Cl or Br, L = PPh3, AsPh3) have been used as precursors for olefin metathesis catalysts in com- bination with aluminium alkyls since 1971 [1]. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 370 It has recently been reported that these complexes initiate the meta- thesis of linear olefins, when supported on alumina or when in solution with- out the use of organometallic co-catalysts [2]. Besides the theoretical interest, these observations may also have some practical importance: (a) the catalysts can be conveniently handled, being insensitive to air and moisture; (b) side reactions such as alkylation, isomerization and oligomerization, usually caused by the acidic co-catalysts, can be avoided. The applicability of these catalysts has already been demonstrated by the preparation of some polymer samples for \"C NMR model studies [3]. In this paper we report the results of our preliminary investigations on the effect of solvents, water, air, alcohol, impurities of the reactants and the composition of the catalysts on the yield and structure for ring-opened poly- mers of norbornene made by these catalysts. Results Bulk polymerization The bulk polymerization of norbornene (NBE) and norbornadiene (NBDE) may be initiated by W(CO)3Cl2(AsPh3)2 (I) at room temperature. The swollen polymer covering the surface of the catalyst crystals soon slows down the polymerization. On addition of alcohol, the solid polymer precip- itates while the excess monomer and catalyst residues remain dissolved in the liquid phase. The yield is mainly determined by gelation, and after a reasonable reaction time (0.1 - 8 h) does not generally exceed 2 - 5%. The \"C NMR spectra of norbornene polymers in DCCIa exhibit the characteristic features of a poly(cyclopentylene vinylene) [4] composed of ring-opened norbornene units (Fig. 1(A)). The cis configuration of the double bonds is in slight excess in the polymer (Op = 0.57 - 0.6). The distribution of the ct's and trans double-bond-containing units along the chain is somewhat blocky, i.e. the cis units are followed by cis units more frequently than anticipated for the case of random distribution. In general, the same is true for the trans double-bond-containing units. Polymers obtained from NBDE at 293 K or 353 K swelled in DCC13 but did not dissolve, possibly indicating crosslinking. Although their spectra are of poor quality, cyclopentenylene vinylene units [5] (Fig. 1(B)) may easily be detected from them. CH-CH CH-CH (A) (B) Fig. 1. Ring-opened units of norbornene (A) and norbornadiene (B). 371 Solution polymerization Polymerization of NBE in benzene at 353 K initiated with I proceeds at an acceptable rate. The rate of polymerization (-Rp = 1.2 0.1 X 1CT4 mol dm'3 s~1) is essentially independent of the monomer concentration in the range [NBE] = 0.25 - 3.0 mol dm 3. There is a slight tendency for increasing cis content (Oc = 0.52 - 0.58) with increasing monomer concentration, while the increase in blockiness [5] is much more definite (r^ = 1.1 - 3.6 0.1). The (Jc and Rp values are surprisingly close to those published by Rooney et al. [6] for the polymerization of 5,5-dimethylnorbornene initiated by the Fischer carbene Ph(MeO)C=W(CO)5. The rate of polymerization becomes diffusion controlled above a 2 - 5% polymer content for the reaction mix- ture, and gelation sets a practical limit to the conversion (Fig. 2).

Reaction time, 20 - 60 min. The molecular weight of the polymers is not very high (Mn = 5000 - 10 000) suggesting that the rate of chain transfer plus chain termination is comparable to that of propagation (1/50 -1/100). When linear chain olefins are used as chain-transfer agents gelation can be avoided and near-quantita- tive conversion of norbornene attained [7]. Benzene is an acceptable solvent for this polymerization: it dissolves the catalyst and the polymer, and is easy to remove from the product (Table 1). The yield in toluene is somewhat smaller. The solubility of the polymer in chlorobenzene is relatively small with the swollen polymer beads separating from the liquid phase at an early stage in the reaction. There was no polymerization at all in nitrobenzene. Aliphatic hydrocarbons such as octane do not dissolve the catalyst. Polymerization occurs, however, and at higher temperatures the yield is quite good. 372 TABLE 1 Effect of solvents on yield of norbornene polymers\" Solvent Yield (%) Product benzene 42 poly(cyclopentylene vinylene) toluene 29 poly(cyclopentylene vinylene) chlorobenzene 24 poly(cyclopentylene vinylene) n-octane 19 poly(cyclopentylene vinylene) n-octane b 53 poly(cyclopentylene vinylene) carbon tetrachloride saturated telomers nitrobenzene 0 ethyl acrylate 0 a [NBE] = 0.46 mol dm\"3; [W(CO)3d2(AsPh3)2] = 0.25 X lO\"3 mol dm\"3; reaction time, 20 min;temp., 353 K. b Reaction temp., 398 K. Of the various solvents tested, carbon tetrachloride appeared as one of the extremes. The conversion of the monomer in CCL} is very high, but the yield of solid polymer is not more than 10%. The polymer is soluble in DCC13 but its double-bond content is practically zero. The majority of the products in this case are soluble in benzene/alcohol and consist mainly of 2-chloro-3-trichloromethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptane and its analogues. Composition of the catalysts In binary homogeneous catalyst systems the activity of tungsten com- pounds is generally high, while that of molybdenum compounds is just about acceptable. This is true in the cases studied here as well. The activity of molybdenum carbonyl halide complexes was at least an order of magnitude lower than that of the analogous tungsten derivatives (Table 2). The effect of the ligands L was also very significant. During the initial stages of our studies, complex I was chosen as the catalyst simply because it is not suscep- tible to easy decarbonylation as are phosphine derivatives [8, 9], i.e. W(CO)3Cl2(PPh3)2 ^ W(CO)2Cl2(PPh3)2 + CO (1) and for this reason a stable catalyst composition could be maintained. As can be seen from Table 2, this choice was fortunate since the activity of the triphenylarsine complex is more than an order of magnitude higher than that of the triphenylphosphine derivative. Such a great and significant difference had not been observed in heterogeneous catalytic studies [2]. Of ligands associated with transition metals, CO seems to play a vital role. While the exchange of other ligands makes a greater or less signif- icant alteration in the activity, the removal of carbonyl ligands destroys it entirely. Although the isoelectronic M(NO)2Cl:iL2 [10, 11] or MCL,!^ [1] complexes are excellent precursors of two-component metathesis catalysts in combination with EtAlC^, they are inactive as one-component catalysts for the polymerization of norbornene under the conditions employed in this 373 TABLE 2 Effect of catalyst composition on yield of ring-opened norbornene polymers a Catalyst Reaction time (min) Yield ( :%) Mo(CO)3Cl2(PPh3)2Mo(CO)3Br2(PPh3)2Mo(CO)3d2(AsPh3)2 W(CO)3Cl2(PPh3)2 W(CO)3d2(AsPh3)2W(CO)3Br2(AsPh3)2Mo(NO)2Cl2(PPh3)2 W(NO)2Cl2(AsPh3)2 Mod4(PPh3)2 WCl4[C2H4(PPh2)2]W(CO)<, 20 20 20 23 20 9 120 120 120 120 120 0.5 0 2 4 51 19 0 0 0 0 0 \"[NBE] = 0.26 mol dm 3; [catalyst] = 0.25 X 10~3 mol dm~3; reaction temperature, 353 K; solvent, benzene. study. However, though the presence of CO in the coordination sphere is a necessary condition for catalytic activity, it is not sufficient by itself to guarantee such behaviour: thus W(CO)e does not initiate the ring-opening polymerization of norbornene. Common catalyst 'poisons' Besides their activity, the other important characteristic of catalysts from the application point of view is their sensitivity towards the usual impurities present in the feed and permanent or accidental poisoning by air and/or moisture. Thus small quantities of water and oxygen are known to behave as activators in multicomponent catalyst systems, but in large quanti- ties they usually quench the reaction. The reaction mixture I/NBE/benzene is not particularly sensitive to such poisons. Under the conditions studied the solution becomes saturated with water at a W/H20 molar ratio of ca. 1:15 which brings about a 20 - 25% fall in the polymer yield (Table 3). On addition of further portions of water the reproducibility of the experiments and the yield of polymer decrease, but the effect on the yield is not proportional to the amount of water added. It should be added that in these experiments the excess water was present as a separate phase and that under these conditions the influence of many un- controlled variables, e.g. the rate of stirring, becomes significant. While the yield did not vary very much, there was a considerable change in the properties of the polymer (Table 4). Thus M^ dropped to one third of the value of the control and the polymeric product was a soft, plastic material even under solvent-free conditions. It was freely soluble in benzene, toluene and chloroform, and the presence of water also caused a decrease in the cis content to Oc = 0.39 although the blockiness of the polymer in- creased, the latter being effected entirely through r^. 374 TABLE 3 Effect of water and air on the yield of polynorbornene Run Water added (jUl) Reaction time (min) Yield (%) NBE/W/HaO mole ratio 3-1 0 25 55 2 100:1:0 3-2 0 20 53+2 100:1:0 3-3 0 15 48 2 100:1:0 3-4 2 20 39 2 100:1:4.3 3-5 8 20 39 2 100:1:17 3-6 16 20 39 2 100:1:34 3-7 40 20 34 5 100:1:85.5 3-8 50 20 34 5 100:1:107 3-9 60 20 25 10 100:1:128 3-10 80 20 25 + 10 100:1:171 3-11 100 20 25 10 100:1:214 3-12 110 20 16 100:1:235 3-13 140 20 0 100:1:299 3-14 160 20 0 100:1:342 3-15 Oh 20 57 100:1: 3-16 Oh 15 55 100:1:- 3-17 O\" 15 50 100:1:- 3-18 O'1 25 33 100:1: 3-19 O6 20 29 100:1:- a Reactions were carried out using 250 mg NBE and 25 mg W(CO)3d2(AsPh3)2 in 10 ml benzene at 353 K. bAir(2m\\)3idded. c At 1.1 bar air pressure. dln air; benzene used as supplied. e [NBE] distilled from Na/K alloy and stored under argon for weeks.

While the effect of air on the polymer yield and on Oc is small, that on the blockiness is significant. Polymerizations may be carried out in air and in unpurified benzene, but in this case the yield drops by 40% compared to the control. Storage of norbomene in a closed glass vessel under dry argon for 375 several days after distillation from Na/K alloy sometimes caused a drop of ca. 40 - 50% in the polymer yield but the reason for this is not clear. It would be anticipitated that alcohol would exhibit a smaller poisoning effect compared to water because of its lower acidity. The addition of small quantities of alcohol does not have much influence either on the yield or on the structure of the polymer (Table 5). The decrease in the yield was not greater than 50% even at a W/EtOH mole ratio of 1:400, but the cis content (Oc) and the blockiness of the polymer are greatly increased. The latter was mainly effected through an increase in r^. In contrast to the effect of water and air, the effect of alcohol on the polymer properties is remarkable.

The yield of the polymer was not influenced to any great extent by the presence of gaseous carbon monoxide. Polymerization under 20 bar pressure of CO at 353 K with an initial concentration of NBE equal to 1 mol dm~3 in benzene initiated by I in a glass autoclave resulted in a 40% yield of poly- norbornene. The value of Oc at 0.50 is somewhat lower, while that of r^, at 3.14 is higher, than that expected for this initial monomer concentration. Discussion M(CO)3X2L2 complexes initiate the metathesis of norbornene and norbornadiene. Of these one-component catalysts, tungsten derivatives are generally superior to those of molybdenum. The compounds W(CO)3X2- (AsPh3)2 (X = Cl or Br) demonstrated fair catalytic activity, the polymers produced from norbornene being moderately high-cis in content. The catalytic activity of the systems is retained in the presence of air and moisture. The mechanism of initiation is not discussed here. However, the relationship between W(CO)4Cl2 (II) [12] and W(CO)3Cl2L2 as catalysts appears to be obvious, since the link between their coordination character- istics and their chemistry has been known for a long time. The heat- and moisture-sensitive dimeric tetracarbonyl halide complexes are easily transformed in solution into a monomeric form and on addition of donor molecules (L) air-stable complexes are formed [8] (eqn. (2)): 376 acetone L [W(CO)4Cl2L ^ W(CO)4Cl2 ?=^ W(CO)3Cl2L2 + CO (2) (II) (I) (L = PPh3, AsPh3, py, . . . etc.) The similarity in catalytic properties between I and II is well demon- strated by their intriguing behaviour in CCl4 solution. Thus Agapiou and McNelis [12] noted that the thermal activation of II in the presence of ole- fins gave only chlorinated products in CCL as a solvent. Our results are similar. When NBE was reacted with a catalytic amount of I in CC4 solution at 353 K, the olefin was converted to saturated products which were composed mostly of 2-chloro-3-trichloromethylbicyclo- [2.2.1]heptane and its analogues (eqn. (3)): W(CO)3d2(AsPh3)2 CCl4 (3) (n = 1, 2, 3 . . . etc.) This is a typical product of the peroxide-catalyzed free-radical telomerization. Whether or not this transition metal catalyzed telomeriza- tion of NBE is a genuine free-radical process has yet to be clarified. The higher activity of II in comparison to I in the metathesis of linear chain olefins might be attributed to the smaller electron density on the central atom in II and its higher susceptibility to substitution reactions. The importance of the tendency towards ligand exchange is very definitely demonstrated in the relative activity of phosphine- and arsine-substituted complexes. We know from other observations [13] that equilibrium (4) exists in solution: W(CO)3X2L2 ?==\" W(CO)3X2L + L (4) The equilibrium constant (K^) in case of L = AsPh3 is much greater than for the triphenylphosphine analogue (Kp): K^/Kp = 20 [13]. The rate-determining step in the initiation is assumed to be reaction (4) followed by coordination of the monomer (eqn. (5)): W(CO)3Cl2L + NBE ^=^ W(CO)3Cl2L(NBE) (5) Coordination of the olefin could also be readily envisaged in complexes of type I following their decarbonylation in reaction (1). This reaction may occur, but cannot be a rate-determining step because (a) molybdenum com- plexes and triphenylphosphine derivatives are more active in reaction (1) than tungsten and triphenylarsine analogues, and (b) the presence of excess CO does not retard the rate of polymerization. However, there is another kind of CO influence on propagation; thus the blockiness of the polymer increases under CO pressure. This is not a unique effect associated with CO, since higher olefin concentration or the 377 presence of alcohol result in increased Oc and r^r^ values as well. This phenomenon may be explained by the so-called 'three-ligand sequence' [14] (Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Reaction scheme for the 'quasi-three-ligand' sequence. In the absence of donor molecules (D) and at low olefin concentrations the polymerization occurs through a 'quasi-three-ligand' propagating species (1) in which the stereochemical relaxation of the chain-carrying carbenes, effected through the mobility of the 'permanent' ligands CO, Cl, etc. (but not through the rotation of the carbenes around the W=C axis) is relatively fast. For this reason the cis/trans distribution of the polymer is near to random. At increasing monomer concentration the available coordination sites become gradually more saturated (structure 4 in Fig. 4); relaxation of the propagating species is now more hindered, and the cis/trans blockiness of the polymer increases. The third coordination site may also be blocked by CO, EtOH, or even other olefins [7], resulting in smaller relaxation opportunities and higher cis/trans blockiness (structure 5 in Fig. 4). In Figs. 3 and 4 the symbol D depicts a real or practical 'vacancy', meaning a structure corresponding to 5-/4-coordinated geometry for the active species, or a coordination site occupied by a weakly bonded solvent molecule in an octahedral structure. Structures 1 - 5 in this discussion are by no means exhaustive as far as the symmetry possibilities in which the inter- mediate metallacycle may form are involved. When the relative orientations of the carbene and the monomer(s) are considered in addition to the three permanent ligands (X, L, CO), such possibilities are numerous. 378 H H H N,/ \\/ \\/ NBE W D -^ NBE W D ^^ NBE W NBE /| / / (5(5')) (2(2')) <4) (3') Fig. 4. Reaction scheme for the non-cage-like 'three-ligand' sequence (D denotes non- olefinic coordinating molecules). What we propose here is closely related to Calderon's 'three-ligand sequence' theory involving the simultaneous coordination of the carbene, monomer and the double bond(s) of the polymer to the transition metal centre [14]. These 'cage-like' complexes are most probably the active species of c;'s-directing catalysts. The simultaneous involvement of at least three coordination sites in the metathesis reaction is also supported by our experimental facts. As proposed by Ivin et at. [15], steric crowding at the metal centre by the ligands alters the polymer structure. However, we have found that within the conditions studied steric crowding may be caused by olefins as well as by other ligands. This effect is mainly demonstrated by the r^c values and more modestly by the c;s selectivity as might be expected at the reaction temperature (353 K). The effect of alcohol on Og is surprisingly large in comparison to non- protic ligands such as CO. The increased blockiness is effected entirely through re, suggesting the presence of an additional driving force towards the formation of c;'s double-bond units. The coordination of the alcohol to the metal also creates a new function in the system. The coordinated alcohol is not liable to deprotonation in the non-polar medium [16] but the formation of hydrogen bonds is possible. The double bond of the polymer chain which is ultimately formed may be coordinated to the metal centre through an ---H 0 W bridge (Fig. 5). In this way the growing chain becomes a bidentate ligand which is assumed to be responsible for the increased ci's selectivity of the catalyst. The influence of the acidity of the OH group and the bulkiness of the alkyi group in the alcohol on the cis-directing activity has yet to be tested. A seemingly slight modification of the catalyst, where water is em- ployed in place of ethanol, leads to a dramatic change in the stereoselec- tivity. The resulting polymer mainly possesses a trans structure and has an in- creased r^t value with the main effect in r^. The formation of HC1 and H W derivatives may now be expected in the system. The predominantly trans structure of the polymer may be attributed to a fast hydrogen transfer be- tween the metal and the a-carbon atom resulting in ready rotation around 379 R / Fig 5 Possible 7T H interactions responsible for the increasing r^, r^r^ and (T(. values for norbornene polymers the W C o-bond axis or to some secondary reaction Further experiments are in progress to test these ideas Experimental The hydrocarbons employed in this study were dried and deoxygenated by refluxing over Na/K alloy-benzophenone and were distilled immediately before use Chlorinated solvents and other polar reactants were distilled from CaH2 and stored over 4 A molecular sieves under dry argon All manipula- tions were carried out in a dry argon atmosphere unless otherwise stated The transition metal complexes were prepared as previously described [8, 17, 18] The reactions were initiated by commencing the circulation of preheated water or paraffin oil in the heating mantle of the all-glass reaction vessel The reactions were quenched thorough the addition of a large amount of cool ethanol The polymers were washed with ethanol and dried in vacuo Telomers were identified by GC-MS analysis \"C NMR spectra were obtained as described in ref 4 but with a reduced spectral window (4000 Hz) The calculation of Oc, r^ and F( values was by the method of Ivm et al [5], based on C2 (Fig 1) values Correction for possible overlap of peaks was not attempted, because the errors were likely to be systematic References 1 L Bencze and L Marko,J Organometall Chem 28(1971)271 2 L Bencze and J Engelhardt, J Mot Catal 25(1982)123 3 K J Ivin, J J Rooney, L Bencze, J G Hamilton, Luk Mm Lam, G Lapiems, B S R Reddy and Ho Huu Thoi, Pure Appi Chem 54 (1982) 447 4 K J Ivin, D T Laverty and J J Rooney, Makromol Chem , 178 (1977) 1545 5 K J Ivm, D T Laverty and J J Rooney, Makromol Chem 279(1978)253 6 Ho Huu Thoi, B S R Reddy and J J Rooney,,/ Chem Soc , Faraday Trans 1, 78 (1982)3307 7 L Bencze and A Kraut Vass, J Organometall Chem , 270 (1984) 211 8 R Coltonandl B Tomkins, Aust J Chem 22(1966)1143 9 B MohaiandL Bencze, Thermochim Acta, 11 (1975)323 10 E A Zuech, W B Hughes, D H Kubik and E T Kittelman, J Am Chem Soc , 92 (1970)528 380 11 W B Hughes,^ Am Chem Soc , 92(1970)532 12 A AgapiouandE McNelis, J Organometall Chem , 99 (1975) C47 13 Z T6th, F Joo, A.

M(CO)3X2L2 complexes, (where M = Mo or W, X = Cl or Br, L = PPh3 or AsPh3) initiate the ring-opening polymerization of norbornene and norbornadiene. Of these one-component catalysts, tungsten derivatives are generally superior to those of molybdenum. Phosphine complexes are poor catalysts, but W(CO)3X2(AsPh3)2 compounds exhibit fair catalytic activity at 353 K. The catalytic activity is retained in the presence of air and moisture. The polymers produced from norbornene are moderately high-cis structure and somewhat blocky with respect to cis/trans distribution. The solvent generally has little effect on the polymer yield. However there was no polymerization in nitrobenzene, a large quantity of ethyl acrylate quenched the reaction and in CCl4 solutions saturated chlorinated telomers were formed exclusively. Steric crowding at the metal centre caused by coordinating molecules, such as CO, alcohol, or even olefins, generally results in increased blockiness for the polymer. A non-cage-like ‘three-ligand sequence’, i.e. the simultaneous involvment of at least three coordination sites in the coordination sphere of the propagating species, is proposed to explain the experimental results. The catalysts are surprisingly tolerant towards alcohol and water. Both additives increase the cis/trans selectivity of the catalysts and the blockiness of the polymer. However, the addition of EtOH results in high-cis polymer with the main effect in r c , while water results in high-traras polymer with the main effect in r t . References 1 L. Bencze L. Markó J.
