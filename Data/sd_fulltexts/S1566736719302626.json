Designing efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is crucial for practical applications in water splitting and metal-air battery devices. Special structures of materials often bring in unprecedented catalytic activity. Herein, we first report the synthesis of CoMoO4 nanotube by using MoO3@ZIF-67 nanorod. The CoMoO4 nanotube shows high OER activity with a low overpotential of 315 mV delivering a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The electro-catalytic activity surpasses that of many Co and Mo-based catalysts. Furthermore, the strategy presented here is facile, and can be extended to the synthesis of other Mo-based nanotube materials for energy storage and conversion. Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Keywords Electrocatalysis Oxygen evolution reaction Non-precious metal catalysts CoMoO4 Nanotubes 1 Introduction Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the most important reactions taken place in various energy storage and conversion devices such as water splitting and metal-air batteries devices [1]. Nevertheless, the sluggish OER kinetics greatly restricts the efficiency of these devices, and catalysts are required to reduce the OER overpotentials [2]. Some precious metal-based compounds such as RuO2 and IrO2 are excellent OER catalysts. However, the scarcity and high cost of the precious metals significantly hindered their large-scale application [3]. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop non-noble metal catalysts with high catalytic activity. Earth-abundant transition metals and their compounds have been intensively investigated and many of them show enhanced OER activity, namely: transition-metal oxides [4], chalcogenides [5], phosphides [6] and borides [7]. Especially for Co-based compounds, such as Co3O4 [8], CoPx [9] and CoNx [10] have been reported as high active OER catalysts due to the high intrinsic activity of Co. By designing multi-composite M-Co compounds, their catalytic activity can be further improved due to the synergistic effect of different metals [11]. Recently, it was shown that Mo can cooperate with Co effectively and great progress has been made in this area [12]. For example, Li et al. [13] found that by modifying MoO2 structure with cobalt oxide nanoparticles, the MoO2-CoO composites exhibit high OER performance due to the synergistic interactions of the different metal elements. Meng et al. [14] reported CoMoO4 nanosheets grown on the conductive carbon cloth with excellent OER activity. On the other hand, catalytic reactions take place on the surface and interface of various active catalytic solid phases. Therefore, it is expected that further improvement of their catalytic activity is to be made by optimizing the structure of catalytic phases in terms of exposing more active catalytic sites. For this purpose, hierarchical microsphere composed MoNi nanosheets [15], porous CoMoO4 nanorod [16] and MoO2-Co2Mo3O8@C [17] nanorods have been developed. However, to promote mass transport, the materials with nanotube structure seem more attractive. To the best of our knowledge, CoMoO4 nanotube with a high surface area has not been reported yet for its OER electrocatalytic activity behavior. Herein, we report the synthesis of porous CoMoO4 nanotube by using MoO3@metal organic framework (ZIF-67) as a precursor. The prepared CoMoO4 solid shows a high specific surface area of 157 m2 g−1 and nanotube structure. When used as OER catalyst, it only requires a low overpotential of 315 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Given to the facile synthesis procedure applied, and the diversity of MOFs, this work can be extended for the synthesis of other Mo-based nanotube materials for a broad energy storage and conversion applications. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of CoMoO4 nanotubes 50 mg of MoO3 nanorods were dispersed in 40 mL of CH3OH solution and sonicated for 10 min. Subsequently, 1.2 g of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), 0.6403 g of Co(NO3)·6H2O and 0.7225 g of 2-methylimidazole were added and stirred at room temperature for 3 h. Then, the obtained solid product (MoO3@ZIF-67) was collected by centrifugation and calcined at 450 °C for 2 h. The thus obtained sample was denoted as MoO3@CoMoO4. The latter solid was then washed with 2 M ammonium hydroxide to remove MoO3, and CoMoO4 nanotubes were thus obtained. 2.2 Electrocatalyst characterization Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM, Nova NanoSEM 450, FEI) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20, FEI) techniques were used to examine the microscopic structure and morphology of the electrocatalysts investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD, Riguku D/MAX2550) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi, ThermoFisher) techniques were used to investigate the bulk structural and surface chemical properties of the catalysts. The BET specific surface area and the pore-size distribution of each of the samples was evaluated by N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (Autosorb-iQ 2ST/MP) at 77 K. 2.3 Electrochemical measurements The electrocatalytic tests were conducted on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode cell. The electrolyte used was O2– saturated KOH solution (1.0 M). A platinum wire was used as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. To prepare the working electrode, 4 mg of the as-prepared carbon was dispersed into a mixture of isopropanol (480 μL), water (480 μL) and 20 μL of Nafion solution, followed by ultrasonication for 20 min to form a uniform catalyst ink. Then, 12 μL of the catalyst ink was dipped onto the glass carbon electrode to get a loading amount of 0.24 mg cm−2. The potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) reference scale by using the following relationship: (1) E RHE = E Ag / AgCl + 0.05 9pH + 0.197 3 Results and discussion To synthesize the CoMoO4 nanotube, MoO3 nanorod was firstly prepared according to a published method (see Fig. S1, ESI) [18]. After adding cobalt nitrate and 2-methylimidazole into MoO3 solution, ZIF-67 can be successfully assembled on the surface of MoO3 with the help of PVP. The SEM images clearly show this reaction, where ZIF-67 polyhedron can be clearly observed on the MoO3 nanobelt (Fig. 1A). XRD analysis also demonstrated this process, where the XRD pattern of MoO3@ZIF-67 contains diffraction peaks of both MoO3 and ZIF-67 solids (Fig. S2, ESI). After thermal annealing at 450 °C for 2 h, the polyhedron becomes smoother due to the pyrolysis of ZIF-67, and the nanobelt becomes shorter, indicating that the MoO3 may react with ZIF-67 during the thermal annealing process (Fig. S3, ESI). The XRD pattern shows that the product (MoO3@CoMoO4) is mainly composed of CoMoO4 and MoO3, though diffraction peaks of MoO3 are not very obvious (Fig. S4, ESI). In order to remove the MoO3 phase and obtain CoMoO4 nanotubes, the MoO3@CoMoO4 was washed with 2 M ammonium hydroxide at room temperature. It can be seen that after ammonium hydroxide washing, the product becomes shorter again. Meanwhile, the MoO3 nanorods disappeared completely and CoMoO4 nanotubes were obtained (Fig. 1B). Another result observed after ammonium hydroxide washing is that the crystallinity of CoMoO4 become weaker, indicating that the post-washing process may lead to defects in the CoMoO4. This is believed to be very beneficial for catalytic applications (Fig. S4, ESI) [19,20]. TEM analysis of CoMoO4 show that the nanotubes are porous, and the high-resolution TEM image clearly reveals the defective polycrystalline structure of the CoMoO4 nanotube, where the lattice fringes with interplanar crystal spacing of 0.335 nm can be ascribed to the (002) crystalline plane of CoMoO4 (Fig. S5, ESI). Moreover, the elemental mapping images clearly show that Co, Mo and O elements are uniformly distributed in the CoMoO4 structure (Fig. S6, ESI). The porous structure of CoMoO4 is also demonstrated by the surface texture measurements (Fig. S7, ESI). The BET specific surface area of CoMoO4 was found to be 157 m2 g−1, which is much higher than that of similar catalysts such as Co3O4/CoMoO4 (93 m2 g−1) [12], CoMoO4 nanorods (39 m2 g−1) [16] and MoO2-Co2Mo3O8@C (39 m2 g−1) [17]. The pore size distribution curve shows a relatively wide size distribution range, from 5 to 50 nm, which can enhance mass transport rates during OER (Fig. 2A). XPS measurements revealed the surface composition of CoMoO4 nanotubes. The survey spectrum shown in Fig. S8 (ESI) indicates the presence of Co, Mo and O elements in the composite. The high-resolution Co 2p spectrum of CoMoO4 can be divided into two peaks, namely 781.0 and 797.0 eV, and two satellite peaks at 785.8 and 803.5 eV, which are characteristic peaks of Co2+ (Fig. 2B) [21]. The Mo 3d spectrum shows two peaks at 232.2 and 235.4 eV, which are related to the Mo d5/2 and Mo d3/2 of Mo6+ in agreement with the presence of MoO4 2− (Fig. 2C) [22]. Thus, Co and Mo in CoMoO4 are present in the form of Co2+ and Mo6+. Moreover, it is proposed that the octahedrally coordinated Co2+ in CoMoO4 is likely to benefit the OER based on experimental and theoretical calculations [11]. Therefore, the OER activity of the CoMoO4 nanotube is believed to be very attractive. In addition, as already reported [23], the price of Mo is much lower than that of Co, and comparable to that of Ni, thus, the price of CoMoO4 should be lower than that of Co3O4 and NiCo2O4 catalysts. Moreover, MoO3 nanorods can be easily synthesized with gram-scale and MoO3@ZF-67 is even synthesized at room temperature after only 3 h. Thus, the synthesis method of CoMoO4 nanotubes seems to be very attractive. The OER catalytic activity of the CoMoO4 nanotubes was investigated in a three-electrode electrochemical cell. MoO3, MoO3@CoMoO4 and commercial RuO2 were also measured for comparison. The anodic polarization curves are shown in Fig. 3A. As expected, the CoMoO4 exhibits a much earlier onset potential and faster increase of current density than MoO3 and MoO3@CoMoO4. Remarkably, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is a measure related to solar fuel synthesis, MoO3 needs a potential of 1.863 V, whereas MoO3@CoMoO4 needs a potential of 1.592 V, indicating that CoMoO4 is more efficient than MoO3. It is suggested that this could be attributed to the synergistic effect of Co and Mo species. It is generally believed that during the OER process, surface Co2+ ions will be transferred to CoO and further to CoOOH. It has been demonstrated that the oxidation of the octahedrally coordinated Co2+ to Co3+ in the CoMoO4 crystal structure is more easily to occur in the presence of MoO4 2−, which can greatly improve the OER activity of CoMoO4 [24]. Especially for the case of CoMoO4 nanotube, the potential further decreases to 1.545 V, corresponding to an overpotential of 315 mV, which is comparable with that of the benchmark RuO2 (315 mV). The catalytic activity of the CoMoO4 nanotube is also comparable with recently reported high-performance OER catalysts (see Tables S1 and S2, ESI). It is seen that the activity of the CoMoO4 nanotube is comparable to similar catalysts. Though some catalysts surpass the values reported here, however, we do provide a facile synthesis method for materials with nanotube structure, which can enable larger specific surface area and more exposed active sites. In addition, the proposed facile synthesis method can be extended to synthesize other Mo-based materials with nanotube-like structure for a broad energy storage and conversion applications. To examine the reason of this improved performance of the CoMoO4 nanotube, the specific surface area of MoO3 and MoO3@CoMoO4 are also measured. As show in Fig. S9 (ESI), the specific surface area of MoO3 and MoO3@CoMoO4 are 9.7 and 22 m2 g−1, respectively, which are much smaller than that of CoMoO4 nanotube. Thus, the improved performance of CoMoO4 can be attributed to its high specific surface area. To gain deep insights into the OER reaction kinetics, the corresponding Tafel plots are fitted and results are shown in Fig. 3B. Obviously, CoMoO4 nanotube exhibits the smaller Tafel slope (89 mV dec−1) with respect to MoO3 (129 mV dec−1) and MoO3@CoMoO4 (108 mV dec−1), suggesting the favourable OER kinetics. To further compare the number of exposed active sites, the double layer capacitance (Cdl), which is proportional to the electrochemically active surface areas of the catalysts, were obtained by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in the non-faradaic region and at different scan rates (Fig. S10, ESI). CoMoO4 nanotube shows a Cdl of 9.0 mF cm−2, which is much higher than that of MoO3 (0.14 mF cm−2) and MoO3@CoMoO4 (4.8 mF cm−2). Moreover, Nyquist plots obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements show that the charge transfer resistance of CoMoO4 nanotube is obviously smaller than that of MoO3 and MoO3@CoMoO4, which further reveals the favourable OER kinetics of CoMoO4 nanotube (Fig. S11, ESI). In addition to its high OER activity, the CoMoO4 nanotube also exhibits good durability as demonstrated by the stable overpotential shown in Fig. S11 (ESI). 4 Conclusions In summary, we reported a new strategy for the synthesis of CoMoO4 nanotubes by using MoO3@ZIF-67 as a template. This is the first example of CoMoO4 nanotube synthesis to the best of our knowledge. The sample shows very high specific surface area and good OER activity. It only needs an overpotential of 315 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2, as well as good long-time stability for at least 20 h. We believe that this work can be further extended to synthesize other Mo-based materials with hollow structure and practical applications for energy storage and conversion.
