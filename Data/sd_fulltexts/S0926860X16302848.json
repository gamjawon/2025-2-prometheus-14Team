Applied Catalysis A: General, 521 (2016) 190 Intrinsic kinetics of plasmon-enhanced reverse water gas shift on Au and Auâ€“Mo interfacial sites supported on silica Insoo Ro, Ronald Carrasquillo-Flores, James A. Dumesic, George W. Huber Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1415 Engineering Drive, Madison, WI 53706, United States Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) causes the same rate enhancement on both Au and AuMox catalytic sites in RWGS reaction. The intrinsic activity of AuMox interfacial site is approximately 14 times greater than the rate per Au site under both dark and light conditions. LSPR causes a decrease in the apparent activation energy suggesting surface plasmons change the intrinsic reaction kinetics of the RWGS reaction.

Applied Catalysis A: General, 521 (2016) 174 Photochemistry of hematite photoanodes under zero applied bias Timothy L. Shelton, Nicholas Harvey, Jiarui Wang, Frank E. Osterloh Department of Chemistry, University of CA, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616, United States Surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) observes photochemical oxidation reactions on Fe2 O3 nanorod ï¬� lms without applied bias. Photovoltages of up to âˆ’130 mV are generated when photoholes are trapped in surface states and react with water. Reactions with sacriï¬� cial electron donors increase the voltage up to âˆ’400 mV. Oxygen increases the photovoltage, suggesting it can promote water oxidation by increasing the concentrationof surface holes.

Added Na+ dispersed homogeneously in SrTiO3 without changing the morphology. Improvement of the photocatalytic activity was originated with the nature of SrTiO3. Addition of alkali, Al, Ga, In, and Mg ions to SrTiO3 was effective for the improvement. Applied Catalysis A: General, 521 (2016) 227 Photocatalytic activity of one step ï¬‚ ame-made ï¬‚ uorine doped TiO2 Maria Vittoria Dozzia, Alessio Zuliania, Ivan Grigionia, Gian Luca Chiarelloa, Laura Medab, Elena Sellia aDipartimento di Chimica, UniversitÃ degli Studi di Milano, via Golgi 19, I-20133 Milano, Italy bDipartimento di Chimica Fisica, Istituto ENI Donegani, via G. Fauser 4, I-28100 Novara, Italy Fluorine doped TiO2 nanopowders are produced by Flame Spray Pyrolysis (FSP). Residual surface ï¬‚ uorine on TiO2 surface inhibits formic acid oxidation at pH 3.7. F-doping of TiO2 produces a beneï¬� cial effects in OH radicals formation at basic pH. Photocurrent performance of slightly F-doped TiO2 exceeds that of pure TiO2. Best photocurrent response is attained in KOH aqueous solution containing methanol.

SiO2/Al2O3 ratio controls the adsorption ability independently of the textural properties. The incorporation of WO3â€“Pt on the zeolite results in Vis light responsive materials. All WO3â€“Pt hybridized zeolites showed photoactivity for the degradation of the studied pollutants under Vis light. WO3â€“Pt hybridized zeolites improve the performance of bare WO3â€“Pt. The SiO2/ Al2O3 ratio and surface area play an important role in the correlation between the results obtained under static and dynamic conditions.

Photocatalytic oxidative performances of Mn+/TiO2 designed by combinations of metal ions and TiO2 powders can be controlled. A photocatalyst composed of an appropriate metal ion (Ru3+) and TiO2 (Ishihara ST-01) exhibited excellent performance.

Due to nanoporosity distributed within the bulk and over the surface of the synthesized photocatalyst, the surface area of the synthesized photocatalyst is increased signiï¬� cantly, as compared to a solid solution prepared through the traditional method. Due to low synthesis time, Zn evaporation at a high temperature was avoided, and a Zn-rich solid solution (up to x = 0.66) was synthesized. A hydrogen evolution rate of 84 Î¼mol hâˆ’1 (AQY = 2.5%) was achieved; this is among the high- est rates reported in open literature for visible light water-splitting. The effectiveness of Zn2+ and Ga3+ layered double hydroxides (LDHs) precursors for a GaZnON solid solution preparation was conï¬� rmed experimentally through measuring the H2 and O2 gas evolutions.
