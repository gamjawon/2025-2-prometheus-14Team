Subrahmanyam Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad 500 007, India (Received 16 March 1993, revised manuscript received 10 November 1993) Abstract In the reaction of acetone, formaldehyde and methanol with ammonia over modified ZSM-5 catalysts, 2-picoline and 2,6-lutidine are synthesized selectively. The catalysts studied were H-ZSM5 with Si/Al ratios, 30, 150 and 280, Pb-ZSM-5, W-ZSM-5 and modified silica-alumina. The yields of 2-picoline obtained were 30-47 wt.-% at 50-60 wt.-% conversions of acetone. The unconverted acetone and methanol can be recycled to increase the over-all yield. Pb-ZSM-5 was identified as the best catalyst. Key words: acetone; Pb-ZSM-5; picoline; W-ZSM-5; zeolites; ZSM-5 1. Introduction Pyridine and substituted pyridines are useful intermediates in pharmaceuticals, herbicides and surface-active agents [ 1 ] . The reaction of acetaldehyde, formaldehyde and ammonia over acidic catalysts leads to pyridine and 3-picoline [ 1,2]. On the other hand, the reaction of acetaldehyde and ammonia gives 2-picoline and 4-picoline. The catalysts used in the preparation of substituted pyridines are Pd-A1203 promoted by PbO, CuO or SiOz-AIZ03 promoted by Th02, ZnO and CdO with 40-60% yield. We have reported [2] the reactions of propylene oxide, propylene glycol; ethylene glycol or acetaldehyde with ammonia over H-ZSM-5 catalyst leading to substituted pyridines and aliphatic amines. Pyridine was also synthesized from ethanol and ammonia over ZSM-5 catalyst in the presence of oxygen with low yields [ 3] . 2-Picoline was observed as a major side-product in the amination of phenol *Corresponding author. * *IICT Communication No. 3151. 0926-860X/94/$07.00 994 Elsevier Science B.V.

Picolines were synthesized over various modified Si02-A1203 and pentasil catalysts [ 5-11 ] . In this paper, we report the selective synthesis of 2-picoline from acetone, formaldehyde, methanol and ammonia over modified ZSM-5 catalysts, with 2,6-lutidine as a major side product. 2. Experimental H-ZSM-5 catalysts used in this study were supplied by Conteka, Sweden. The catalyst was modified with a known weight of lead nitrate (20% Pb0) and ammonium metatungstate (12 wt.-% W). Silica-alumina used in this study was supplied by Akzo Chemie, Netherlands with 84:16 wt.-% of silica-alumina. Modification of the catalysts was carried out by the impregnation technique. The ice-cooled mixture of acetone and 40 wt.-% aqueous formaldehyde was used in the feed. Ammonia gas was introduced separately. The reactions were carried out using a tubular, down-flow pyrex reactor with 20 mm internal diameter. The reaction mixture was fed from the top using a Sage syringe pump. The product was cooled using ice-cooled water and collected at the bottom. A sufficient number of ice-cooled traps were used at the outlet end to collect the total amount of products. The products were analyzed by SE-30 (5%) and [ chromosorb (5%) ] columns. The analysis was confirmed by mass spectra and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). 3. Results and discussion The reaction of acetone, formaldehyde and methanol with ammonia was carried out over various ZSM-5 catalysts. The results are tabulated in Table 1.

Three H-ZSM5 catalysts with (Si/Al) =30, 150 and 280 were tested. H-ZSM-5 (30), H-ZSM-5 (150) and H-ZSM-5 (280) showed 40.8, 58.7 and 41.1% conversion of acetone, respectively. The yields of 2-picoline for H-ZSM-5 (30), H-ZSM-5 (150) and H-ZSM-5 (280) were 27.0, 33.5 and 28.0 wt.-% based on acetone and (2-/4-picoline) ratios were 9.0, 8.4% and `very high', respectively. H-ZSM-5 (150) showed the highest activity for the formation of 2-picoline. 4-Picoline was not observed in the case of H-ZSM-5 (280) . To get a high activity in the dehydrocyclization reaction, an optimum number of active centres are required. With the increase of the (Si/Al) ratio there was an increase in the (2-/4-picoline) ratio. The yield of total lutidines obtained was 10--40 wt.-% and 2,6-lutidine was > 90% among the lutidines. Bipyridine ( < 10%) compound was also obtained at lower (350) temperature confirmed by GC-MS. In the case of Pb-ZSM-5 and W-ZSM-5, the conversions of acetone were 69.0 and 51.2 wt.-% while the yields of 2-picoline were 35.0 and 29.0 wt.-%, respectively. The yield of 4-picoline observed was low (2 wt.-%). Thus lead and tungsten have a promoting effect in increasing the yield of 2-picoline. The lead promoted silica-alumina PbSA (1) and PbSA(2) showed 16.0 and 6.8 wt.-% 2-picoline formation. In the case of Pb-ZSM-5 and W-ZSM-5, the yield of lutidines was 18-25 wt.-%. To understand the stoichiometry, the following different reactions were carried out over Pb-ZSM-5 (150) at 420 and 0.5 h-' WHSV, (1) acetone, formaldehyde, methanol and ammonia, (2) acetone, formaldehyde (1:1.05 molar) and ammonia, (3) acetone, formaldehyde (4: 1) and ammonia, (4) acetone, methanol and ammonia and (5) acetone and ammonia. The experimental data are given in Table 2. The selectivity among the picolines and yield of 2-picoline were enhanced predominantly after addition of formaldehyde to the feed. The molar ratios of acetone to formaldehyde were varied widely, including a ratio of 1: 3, but formaldehyde polymerized, forming a solid and coke in the pre-heater zone; so the addition of methanol is essential to enhance the yield. The stoichiometry may be suggested as follows for the formation of picoline. acetone + 3 formaldehyde + ammonia - picoline +4 water (1) As lutidines are also observed in the products, the mechanism and stoichiometry may also be represented as given in Scheme 1. The influence of the WHSV is depicted in Table 3. The WHSV .was varied from 0.25 to 1 h-'. The reaction of acetone, formaldehyde, methanol with ammonia was carried out over Pb-ZSM-5 at 420. The conversions of acetone for 1, 0.75, 0.50, 0.37 and 0.25 h -' WHSV were 59.3, 72.6, 69.0, 68.2 and 69.4 wt.-% and yields for 2-picoline were 15.6, 31.5, 35, 47.5 and 45 wt.-%, respectively. With the increase of WHSV, the yield increased upto 0.37 h-'. The ratio of 2-picoline/4-picoline increased with the decrease of WHSV. The experimental data in Table 4 indicate that 2-picoline in the product increases, as the amount of lutidines decreases. The reaction of lutidine and water (1:2.5 mol) over Pb-ZSM-5 at 420 and 0.5 h-' WHSV leads to > 5.6 wt.-% 2-picoline and 3.6% pyridine at > 90% conversion of lutidine. The reaction of 2,6-lutidine, water and ammonia also leads to the formation of > 10% 2-picoline and pyridine.

The experiments in which polymerized formaldehyde was not observed in the pre-heater zone are reported. The experimental data in Table 2 indicate that the increase of formaldehyde in the feed increases the amount of 2-picoline in the product. This may be explained by the stoichiometric Eq. (1) .

        "dc:description": "In the reaction of acetone, formaldehyde and methanol with ammonia over modified ZSM-5 catalysts, 2-picoline and 2,6-lutidine are synthesized selectively. The catalysts studied were H-ZSM-5 with Si/Al ratios, 30, 150 and 280, Pb-ZSM-5, W-ZSM-5 and modified silica-alumina. The yields of 2-picoline obtained were 30–47 wt.-% at 50–60 wt.-% conversions of acetone. The unconverted acetone and methanol can be recycled to increase the over-all yield. Pb-ZSM-5 was identified as the best catalyst.",
