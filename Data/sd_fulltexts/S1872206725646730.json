Unfortunately, as the loading increases, the agglomeration and growth of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) occur, causing unsatisfactory performance. Here, we present an efficient method for preparing of highly dispersed and small-sized Pt/C catalysts with Pt loadings varying from 39.01 wt% to 66.48 wt% through the high-temperature shock technique. The high density and ultrafine (~2.5 nm) Pt NPs are successfully anchored onto Vulcan XC-72R carbon black without the use of additional capping agents or surfactants. The modified carbon supports enhance the affinity for Pt precursors, contributing to loading efficiencies of 95% or more, while also providing abundant sites for the nucleation and fixation of Pt NPs, thus preventing agglomeration. In the context of the hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic media, the as-synthesized high-loading Pt/C catalysts show remarkable activity and stability, outperforming the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C. This is mainly because the combined effects of ultrasmall and uniform Pt NPs, optimized electronic structure of Pt site, superhydrophilicity and effective anchoring of Pt NPs. The polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer integrated with Pt60/OX72R and commercial IrO2 reaches 1 A cm–2 at 1.77 V and operates stably for 120 hours with a negligible voltage decay. This new strategy is fast, scalable and cost-effective for large-scale production of metal-supported catalysts, especially for the high-loading ones. Graphical Abstract This study resolves the contradiction between high loading and nanoparticle dispersion in traditional Pt/C catalyst preparation. The resulting Pt/C exhibits superior PEMWE performance than commercial Pt/C. Keywords Pt/C catalyst Ultrahigh loading Ultrasmall size High-temperature shock Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis 1 Introduction Hydrogen (H2) is well acknowledged as the most promising substitute for fossil fuels [ 1,2 ]. Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), distinguished by high efficiency, immediate response and high hydrogen purity, is a promising way to produce hydrogen on large scale [ 3–5 ]. During PEMWE, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a key reaction for hydrogen production, which requires a catalyst to accelerate the sluggish kinetics [ 6 ]. To date, carbon black-supported platinum (Pt/C) is the most efficient commercial HER catalyst in PEMWE [ 7 ]. However, the Pt loadings of Pt-based supported catalysts in most published studies are below the benchmark of 20 wt% [ 8 ]. When these catalysts are employed as the cathode in membrane electrode assembly (MEA), a thicker catalyst layer can form which increases the mass transfer resistance and deteriorates the performance of PEMWE [ 9–12 ]. Consequently, the development of high metal loading Pt/C catalysts (≥ 40 wt%) is essential for improving platinum utilization efficiency and enhancing the performance of PEMWE. Although commercial high-loading Pt/C catalysts are available, the controllability on the size and dispersion of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) remains a key challenge result in insufficient catalytic activity and durability [ 13,14 ]. In the synthesis of Pt/C catalysts, high loading can easily cause agglomeration of Pt NPs, which gets more severe with increasing metal loading [ 15–17 ]. Meanwhile, smaller size and better dispersion of the NPs are beneficial for better catalytic performance [ 18–21 ]. Therefore, the challenge of preparing high-loading Pt/C catalysts lies in preventing the growth of Pt NPs while maintaining their dispersion. Till now, various synthetic strategies including impregnation reduction [ 14 ], polyol method [ 22 ], high temperature pyrolysis [ 23 ], and chemical vapor deposition [ 24 ] have been developed to synthesis small and concentrated Pt NPs on the carbon supports. However, to the best of our knowledge, the production of Pt/C catalysts with Pt loadings above 40 wt% remains challenging [ 25–28 ]. This is critical for ensuring the catalytic activity, stability and overall performance of PEMWE, where simple and economical strategies for preparing high-performance high-loading Pt/C catalysts are in urgent need. Recently, Joule-heating-based high-temperature shock (HTS) technology has been successfully developed for the ultrafast synthesis of metal NPs with uniform dispersion on carbon supports (e.g., CNFs, RGO films) [ 29–32 ]. HTS allows precise control of the heating and cooling process during synthesis, which can effectively minimize the migration and aggregation of Pt NPs. However, HTS production of supported Pt catalysts with the Pt loading of over the threshold of 20 wt% still suffers from the agglomeration of Pt NPs, especially when Pt NPs are directly grown on carbon black in the absence of any ligands or surfactants [ 29,33 ]. Herein, we propose an effective and general HTS pyrolysis strategy for producing a series of high-loading Pt/C electrocatalysts (≥ 40 wt%) with small particle size (sub-2.5 nm) and uniform dispersion on functionalized Vulcan XC-72R carbon black. This processing enables large-scale production of high-loading Pt/C catalysts without reductant or capping agents, where Pt(acac)2 is used as a precursor and modified carbon black is used as a support material. The abundant surface-bound oxygenic functional groups can simultaneously enhance the affinity between metal precursors and carbon supports accelerating the nucleation rate, and provide abundant sites for anchoring and dispersion Pt NPs strengthening the metal-support interactions [ 34–36 ]. Benefiting from the ultrafast heating and cooling of HTS, the pre-adsorbed Pt(acac)2 precursors undergo rapid pyrolysis, resulting in small-sized and uniformly dispersed Pt NPs. More importantly, the surface-bound oxygenic functional groups have optimized the electronic structure of Pt site and significantly improved the hydrophilicity of catalysts. The HER electrocatalytic properties of as-synthesized high-loading Pt/C catalysts are significantly higher than commercial Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, a single PEMWE has been fabricated using as-synthesized Pt40/OX72R and Pt60/OX72R samples as cathode catalysts, which also demonstrates excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability comparing with the commercial Pt/C-based ones. These results confirm that the high-loading Pt/C catalysts synthesized by this method have good application prospects in water electrolysis. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals Platinum acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2, 97%) and iridium acetylacetonate (Ir(acac)3, 99.95%) were purchased from Aladdin Co., Ltd., China. Nitric acid (HNO3, 68%), acetone (C3COCH3, 99.5%), and isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99%) were purchased from Fengchuan Chemical Reagent (Tianjin, China) Co., Ltd. Vulcan XC-72R carbon black (72R) was purchased from Cabot Corporation (USA). Commercial Pt/C catalysts (40 or 60 wt%) were manufactured by Johnson Matthey and used as references. Commercial IrO2 was purchased from Shanghai July Chemical Co., Ltd. Deionized water (DI, 18.2 MΩ cm at 25 °C) was provided by the ultrapure water system (Milli-Q). All the chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received. 2.2 Preparation of high-loading Pt/C catalysts The pre-oxidation treatment of Vulcan XC-72R carbon powder was conducted by condensation reflux method. In brief, 1 g of the carbon black was mixed with 100 mL HNO3 solution and heated in an oil bath under refluxing conditions for at least 10 hours with continuously magnetic stirring. Subsequently, the suspension was centrifugated and washed with DI water for three times. Then, the functionalized carbon black, denoted as OX-72R, was obtained after drying at 80 °C under vacuum overnight. The synthesis of Pt/C catalysts with different Pt loading were carried out using a HTS pyrolysis process. For a typical synthesis of 60 wt% Pt/C, 160 mg of Pt(acac)2 was introduced to acetone and stirred until forming a completely transparent solution. Afterwards, 50 mg of as-prepared OX-72R was added into the solution and ultrasonicated for 10 min to make a uniform dispersion. To remove the acetone, the suspension was heated and continually stirred until a solid mixture was obtained. Subsequently, the precursor-loaded powders were pyrolyzed in argon (Ar) condition using the HTS equipment (Shenzhen Zhongkejingyan Company) for output current up to 15 A. Finally, the product was collected from the carbon paper and referred to as Pt60/OX72R. The other Pt/C catalysts synthesized in the same way were referred as Pt40/OX72R, Pt50/OX72R, and Pt70/OX72R when the Pt mass loadings were controlled as 40 wt%, 50 wt%, and 70 wt%, respectively. For comparison, Pt40/72R, Pt50/72R, Pt60/72R, and Pt70/72R were prepared through the same process using pristine 72R carbon black as support. The TF-Pt40/OX72R with a Pt mass loading of 40 wt% was synthesized using the same method in a tube furnace. The furnace was heated to 400 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 for 0.5 h under a flowing Ar atmosphere, followed by natural cooling to room temperature. Similar to the synthesis of Pt40/OX72R, the Ir/OX72R sample was also prepared using Ir(acac)3 as precursors. 2.3 Material characterizations The crystal structure was analyzed by a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with Cu-K α radiation. The morphology and microstructure were investigated by a thermal field scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JSM-7800F) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEM-2100F). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained with a ThermoFisher Scientific ESCALAB 250XI. Raman spectra were measured using Edinburgh RM5 with the excitation laser line at 532 nm. The metal loading of Pt on carbon black was quantified by Thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) (NETZSCH STA 449F3) under air atmosphere. The surface area and porosity were determined by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms obtained from Micromeritics ASAP 2010. Zeta potential was measured using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS90 and the samples were dispersed in ethanol medium without addition of other substances. The contact angle was measured by a contact angle measurement instrument (Dataphysics OCA20). XAS spectra were obtained on BL14W1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). The raw data was analyzed based on the ATHENA, ARTEMIS software package [ 37 ]. Pair distribution function (PDF) patterns were collected from the Powder Diffraction beamline at SSRF. The total diffraction data were converted to G(r) using the PDFgetX3 program [ 38 ] and the refinements were performed using PDFgui [ 39 ]. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements The HER performance of Pt/C catalysts was evaluated using a three-electrode system within an H-type electrolysis cell on an electrochemical station (CHI 660E) at room temperature. The Hg/Hg2SO4 electrode (saturated potassium sulfate solution) and Pt foil were used as reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing 2 mg catalysts and 10 μL 5 wt% Nafion solution in a mixed solution (450 μL IPA and 50 μL DI water). The working electrode (WE) was fabricated by loading 20 μL of uniformly dispersed ink onto glassy-carbon (GC) electrode. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were conducted in 0.5 mol L–1 H2SO4 solution in the potential range of –0.35 to 0 V versus RHE with scan rates of 50 mV s–1 for 10 cycles. Subsequently, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) polarization curves were recorded in the same potential range with a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 with iR compensation (90%). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at open circuit potential. The double-layer capacitances (C dl) were calculated and fitted according to CV curves from the non-Faradaic potentials at varied scan rates. To estimate the long-term stability of catalysts, the chronopotentiometric curves were obtained with different current densities of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm–2. The durability of the catalysts was tested by comparing the LSV curves before and after 2000 CV cycles. All measured potentials were calibrated to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the Nernst equation: E (RHE) = E (Hg/Hg2SO4) + 0.652 + 0.059 pH. 2.5 PEMWE measurements The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was fabricated using the catalyst-coated-membrane (CCM) method with a spray equipment. The proton exchange membrane was a Nafion 115, while commercial IrO2 (Shanghai Jiuling Chemical Co. Ltd) and Pt/C sample were used as the anode catalyst and cathode catalyst, respectively. To prepare the catalyst ink, catalysts were dispersed to a mixture of IPA and DI water with a ratio of 4:1. Then, 5 wt% Nafion solution was added in to obtain an ionomer amount of 30 wt% for anode and 40 wt% for cathode with sonication for 1 h. The mass loadings of Pt and IrO2 were controlled to be 0.5 and 2 mg cm–2. The membrane with electrocatalysts coated and two Ti-fiber felts (Suzhou Sinero Technology Co., Ltd) were hot pressed together to establish the MEA under 130 °C with a pressure of 2 MPa for 5 min. The PEMWE cell was integrated via pressing two Ti bipolar plates and MEA. A flow of water preheated to 60 °C at 50 mL min–1 was supplied to the anode side through peristaltic pump circulation. The polarization curves were collected at step of 50 mV between 1.3 and 2 V. The stability of the PEMWE cell were evaluated by measuring chronopotentiometry at 1 A cm–2 for over 100 h. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Carbon black oxidation and structure A pre-oxidation treatment of the pristine Vulcan XC-72R was conducted before depositing Pt NPs. Two different carbon supports (untreated 72R and treated OX-72R) were characterized by various analytical methods to comprehensively reveal the effect of oxidation on their structure and surface properties. The surface area and pore size distributions of the samples were characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods from the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (Fig. S1). The specific surface area (310.83 m2 g–1) and pore volume (0.424 cm3 g–1) of OX-72R are ~1.53 and ~1.65 times larger than those (202.65 m2 g–1 and 0.257 cm3 g–1) of 72R, respectively. These increases can be attributed to the formation of abundant micropores following the oxidation treatment. As illustrated in Fig. S1(b), the untreated 72R exhibits a minimal porosity. Whereas the treated OX-72R demonstrates a distinct peak at 4 nm, signifying the presence of a substantial number of micropores. Furthermore, XPS survey spectra of the samples, as shown in Fig. S2(a), all samples exhibit the presence of C and O elements. The atomic abundance of elements on or near the surface are tabulated in Table S1. The significantly higher atomic percentage of oxygen in OX-72R compared to 72R indicates the successful incorporation of oxygenic functional groups on the surface of carbon black. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a) , the high-resolution C 1s spectra of 72R and OX-72R can be deconvoluted into two peaks and four peaks, respectively [ 40 ]. For OX-72R, in addition to the emergence of two peaks corresponding to C=O and O=C–O bonding, the peaks corresponding to C–C and C–OH bonding exhibit reduced and increased peak intensity, respectively. Fig. S2(b) reveals a distinct N 1s peak for OX-72R, which is absent in 72R. This demonstrates that nitrogen groups were successfully doped into the carbon support. These surface-bound oxygenic functional groups on the OX-72R support play a crucial role in the nucleation and growth of Pt NPs by serving as anchoring sites [ 41,42 ]. Raman spectra for the two samples are shown in Fig. 1(b), where two broad peaks located at 1340 and 1580 cm–1 correspond to the D band (structural defects) and G band (graphitic carbon), respectively [ 35 ]. The intensity ratio between D band to G band (I D/I G) of the OX-72R is calculated as 0.97, which is higher than 0.78 of 72R. This result indicates that the OX-72R support has more structural defects, which can provide more anchoring sites for Pt NPs nucleation and growth. Morphologies of the samples are depicted by SEM as shown in Fig. S3, demonstrating near-spherical particles of carbon blacks (30–60 nm in size) in both samples. Additionally, the particles of oxidized OX-72R are smaller and less spherical. To clarify the structural change after oxidation treatment intuitively, TEM analysis was performed, as shown in Figs. 1(c) and (d). Comparing with the intact carbon nanoparticles of 72R, the interior of OX-72R carbon nanoparticles is severely eroded, forming a large number of pores, which is consistent with the BET and pore size distribution analyses. As shown in Fig. S4, two representative peaks are observed at 25° and 43°, corresponding to the (002) and (100) planes of carbon, respectively. In general, the intensity of (002) diffraction peak is associated to the amorphous carbonaceous interlayers [ 42,43 ]. The (002) peak intensity of OX-72R is significantly higher than that of 72R, indicating that the amorphous carbon inside the carbon black has been eroded away together with the formation of porous structure. Consequently, the OX-72R supports has more abundant functional groups and more porous structures, which is conducive to the high loading of small-sized and well-dispersed Pt NPs. 3.2 Pt/C catalyst synthesis The synthetic procedure of Pt/C catalysts with different metal loading levels is schematically shown in Fig. 1(e). In a typical synthesis process, the OX-72R carbon black was used as support to absorb platinum acetylacetonate, which was then subjected to rapid HTS pyrolysis under the protection of the Ar atmosphere to yield Pt NPs. Temporal evolution of temperature in the HTS process is presented in Fig. 1(f), where the sample is rapidly heated to ~400 °C and then cooled within ~1 s. As shown in Fig. S5, disappearance of the diffraction peak for Pt(acac)2 and broadening of diffraction peak for Pt NPs, indicate the successful synthesis of Pt/C catalysts (Pt40/OX72R) during this superfast HTS process. The pristine carbon black (72R) with Pt(acac)2 were treated with the same HTS process to support Pt NPs for comparison. Taking the OX-72R and 72R with Pt loading of 40 wt% as examples, denoted as Pt40/OX72R and Pt40/72R, the morphology and dispersion of Pt NPs were investigated by TEM. The fine Pt NPs with the average size of 2.36 nm and a narrow size distribution in Pt40/OX72R are homogeneously distributed on the carbon black (Figs. 1(g) and S6). In contrast, when untreated 72R was used as the support, larger Pt NPs (average size of 3.54 nm) with less uniformity were observed under the same synthesis conditions (Figs. 1(h) and S7). This indicates strong anchoring effect of surface-bound oxygenic functional groups and defect sites in inhibiting overgrowth and agglomeration of Pt NPs. The rapid HTS process is also important for the formation of small and well-dispersed Pt NPs. Figs. 1(i) and S8 present the TEM images and the corresponding Pt NPs size distribution of TF-Pt40/OX72R prepared by a tube furnace, where a significant increase in Pt NPs size (average size of 3.79 nm) has been observed. For comparison, the TEM images of commercial 40 wt% Pt/C is shown in Fig. S9 illustrating a wider distribution range and a larger size of Pt NPs (3.82 ± 3 nm) with inhomogeneous dispersion. Smaller size and better dispersion of Pt NPs can increase active surface area and therefore enhance the performance. Moreover, denser visible Pt NPs can be observed in the TEM image of Pt40/OX72R compared with that of Pt40/72R. TGA measurements under air were used to characterize actual Pt loadings of the samples (Fig. 1(j)). A significant weight loss is observed below 500 °C in the two curves referring to the combustion of carbon support. The prior weight loss of Pt40/OX72R before this temperature can be attributed to rich oxygenic functional groups on the carbon surface. When the temperature reaches 600 °C, the weight loss begins to stabilize, and the residuals are confirmed as metallic Pt by XRD (Fig. S10). Consequently, the actual Pt loading in the sample can be accurately determined, which are 25.02 wt% for Pt40/72R and 39.01 wt% for Pt40/OX72R. Pt loadings of both samples are smaller than the theoretical value of 40%. Theoretical loading refers to the mass percentage of Pt that is completely decomposed from the Pt(acac)2 and subsequently loaded onto the carbon black. This discrepancy indicates varying Pt loading efficiencies. It is well known that the sublimation of Pt(acac)2 occurs when the temperature exceeds 200 °C [ 44 ], resulting in a Pt loading efficiency of only 62.5% for 72R support. In contrast, OX-72R support achieves a much higher Pt loading efficiency of 97.53%, due to significantly enhance the affinity of Pt(acac)2 to carbon black through electrostatic interactions induced by additional surface-bound oxygenic functional groups [ 41 ]. The zeta potential changes of 72R and OX-72R carbon blacks, both before and after the addition of Pt(acac)2, were measured in an ethanol medium. As shown in Fig. S11, the surface of OX-72R is rich in oxygenic functional groups, such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, which can dissociate into H+ ions in solution, resulting in a more negative zeta potential compared to 72R [ 45 ]. Upon the introduction of Pt(acac)2 to the surfaces of both carbon blacks, their zeta potentials noticeably shifted towards positive values. This observation suggests that the electrostatic interaction between OX72R and Pt(acac)2 is stronger than that between 72R and Pt(acac)2, indicating that OX72R has an enhanced affinity to the precursor Pt(acac)2. Achieving high Pt loading efficiency can benefit cost reduction, considering that Pt is a noble metal. The synthesis of the Pt40/OX72R catalyst involves the mixing of Pt(acac)2 with oxidized carbon black, followed by rapid drying and pyrolysis steps (Fig. 1(e)). This process is characterized by its simplicity, ease of operation, high reproducibility, and scalability. As a proof-of-concept, a synthesis at the scale of 250 mg was successfully conducted in the lab (Fig. S12), demonstrating the scalability of the method. Larger production scale on gram and kilogram level can be easily realized by increasing the initial amount of Pt(acac)2 and carbon black proportionally. The method also eliminates the need for additional capping agents or surfactants, allowing nearly 100% Pt utilization, which effectively reduces the cost of catalyst preparation. More importantly, this method is not only applicable to Pt/C but can also be extended to the synthesis of other carbon supported metal nanoparticles. Taking Ir as an example, the morphology of the synthesized Ir/OX72R was first investigated by TEM, as shown in Fig. S13. As anticipated, a significant number of ultrafine Ir nanoclusters, with average size of ~1.13 nm, were uniformly dispersed on the surface of carbon black without any aggregation. This successful extension highlights the versatility and substantial potential of this method for the preparation of homogeneously dispersed ultrafine metal NPs with high loadings on carbon supports. Generally, increasing loading of Pt NPs leads to denser dispersion and aggregation. However, in this study, the Pt NPs maintain small size and uniform dispersion even when the Pt loading is increased from 40 wt% to 70 wt%. The as-synthesized Pt/C sample with a theoretical Pt loading of 50 wt%, denoted as Pt50/OX72R, was characterized by SEM as shown in Fig. 2(a) , demonstrating similar spherical particles of the carbon black support. However, the discernible Pt NPs unobserved in the enlargement image (Fig. 2(b)) indicating that the exceptionally small size and uniform dispersion of Pt NPs. TEM was employed to further investigate the microstructure and dispersion of Pt NPs in Pt50/OX72R, as well as in the samples with theoretical Pt loadings of 60 wt% (Pt60/OX72R) and 70 wt% (Pt70/OX72R). As shown in Figs. 2(c), S14(a), and S15(a), typical low-magnification TEM images demonstrate the successful loading of Pt NPs with a uniform dispersion, high concentration, and small particle size on the carbon black substrate. The high magnification TEM images (Figs. 2(d), S14(b), and S15(b)) further reveal the spherical Pt NPs with average sizes of 2.39 nm for Pt50/OX72R (Fig. 2(e)), 2.52 nm for Pt60/OX72R (Fig. S14(c)), and 2.62 nm for Pt70/OX72R (Fig. S15(c)) uniformly dispersed on the carbon support. Apparently, increasing the Pt loading results in a slight increase in particle size and deterioration of the dispersion of Pt NPs. In comparison, the Pt50/72R, Pt60/72R, and Pt70/72R samples exhibit larger sizes of Pt NPs of 3.74, 4.01, and 4.46 nm, respectively, along with wider distribution ranges (Figs. S16–S18). Compared to Pt60/OX72R, the Pt NPs in Pt60/72R exhibit both increased size and a significant emergence of Pt nanowires, confirming the anchoring effect of OX-72R on Pt NPs. Additionally, the high-resolution TEM image in Fig. 2(f) clearly shows the high crystallinity characteristic of Pt NP with lattice fringes measured about 0.22 nm, corresponding to the lattice space of (111) plane of Pt. Furthermore, STEM was used to further reveal the structural features of Pt50/OX72R, demonstrating the small size and homogeneous dispersion of Pt NPs (small bright spots shown in Fig. 2(g)). The STEM energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping also show that Pt atoms are well-dispersed throughout the carbon support (Fig. 2(h)). According to the TGA analysis results presented in Figs 2(i) and S19, the actual Pt loadings for Pt50/OX72R, Pt60/OX72R, and Pt70/OX72R are 48.69 wt%, 58.05 wt%, and 66.48 wt%, respectively. In comparison, the loadings for Pt50/72R, Pt60/72R, and Pt70/72R are 31.22 wt%, 37.04 wt%, and 49.62 wt%, respectively (Fig. S20). Table S2 presents a summary of the particle sizes and Pt mass loadings for the Pt/C catalysts (Pt40/OX72R, Pt50/OX72R, etc.) synthesized in this study. The small sizes (~2.5 nm) and high loading efficiencies (wt% 95%) of Pt50/OX72R, Pt60/OX72R, and Pt70/OX72R indicate that the anchoring effect and the enhanced affinity of oxidized carbon black remains effective even at elevated loading levels. 3.3 Pt/C catalyst structure characterization The structural characteristics of Pt50/OX72R were further analyzed and compared with Pt50/72R. XRD patterns of both samples (Fig. 3(a) ) demonstrate one broad peak at ~25° correlating to carbon black, and three peaks corresponding to the (111), (200) and (220) crystalline planes of metal Pt. Notably, the Pt peaks of Pt50/OX72R are much broader than those of Pt50/72R indicating smaller size of Pt NPs for Pt50/OX72R. Utilizing the Scherrer formula [ 15 ], the particle sizes of Pt50/72R and Pt50/OX72R are calculated as 4.41 and 2.67 nm, respectively, which aligns well with the TEM analyses. In addition, the particle sizes calculated from XRD results for the other seven samples (Figs. S5, S7(d), S8(d), S14(d), S15(d), S17(d), and S18(d)), including Pt60/72R and Pt60/OX72R, are summarized in Table S2 and also demonstrate consistency with the TEM analysis results. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the specific surface area and pore volume of both samples were characterized by the BET and BJH methods. The two samples exhibit similar N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm shapes and pore size distribution curves. Mesopores ranging from 2 to 10 nm are dominating in both distribution curves. Meanwhile, the pore volume of Pt50/OX72R is much smaller than that of Pt50/72R, indicating that many Pt NPs are deposited in the pores of OX72R support (inset of Fig. 3(b)). Fig. 3(c) provides a detailed summary on the changes in specific surface areas and pore volumes of the 72R and OX-72R carbon blacks before and after the deposition of Pt NPs, further demonstrating the effective Pt loading on OX-72R carbon black. The surface element compositions and elemental chemical states of Pt50/72R and Pt50/OX72R were further analyzed using XPS. The Pt content on the surface of Pt50/OX72R is almost 2 times of that on the surface of Pt50/72R (Fig. S21), which is consistent with the analysis results of TGA and BET. The high-resolution Pt 4f spectra and O 1s spectra of two Pt/C catalysts were deconvoluted into the corresponding element entities. As shown in Fig. 3(d), Pt50/OX72R shows the typical doublet peaks located at 71.9 eV (Pt 4f 7/2) and 75.1 eV (Pt 4f 5/2) corresponding to the metallic Pt, respectively, along with a positive shift in binding energy compared to Pt50/72R (71.6 eV for Pt 4f 7/2 and 74.8 eV for Pt 4f 5/2). This shift can be attributed to the presence of oxygenic functional groups that result in a more extensive withdrawal of electrons from the Pt NPs by the carbon support due to the higher electronegativity of oxygen atoms [ 35 ]. Apart from two peaks representing C–O groups and absorbed oxygen, the deconvolution of the O 1s spectrum in Pt50/OX72R reveals a new peak attributed to the Pt–O bond, which is not present in Pt50/72R. When considered alongside the Pt 4f spectrum of Pt50/OX72R, it is evident that the Pt–O bond does not arise from the surface oxidation of Pt NPs. This finding further underscores the strong interaction between the Pt NPs and the OX72R carbon supports. This robust electronic interaction facilitates the anchoring effect on Pt NP, enhances their dispersion and catalytic stability, modulates the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms, and improves the catalytic activity. To further understand the coordination structures of Pt atoms in the Pt50/OX72R, XAS measurement was performed at the Pt L3 edge (Fig. S22). As shown in Fig. 3(f), the Fourier transform extended X-ray adsorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum of Pt50/OX72R shows a main peak at 2.5 Å attributed to the first Pt–Pt coordination shell. Different from the referential Pt foil, a distinct peak at 1.5 Å corresponding to Pt–O coordination exists for Pt50/OX72R [ 46 ]. Further EXAFS curve fitting reveals that the coordination number and interatomic distance of Pt–Pt in Pt50/OX72R are 5.21 and 2.73 Å, respectively. Both these values of Pt50/OX72R are smaller than the standard values of Pt foil (Figs. S23 and S24, Table S3). These findings are consistent with the XPS results, indicating that the Pt NPs are anchored by oxygenic functional groups through Pt-O bonds. The PDF method has been widely used to study the local structure of nanomaterials and has proven to be very successful. In comparison with EXAFS method, PDF method could summarize the interatomic correlations at much greater distances [ 47 ]. Fig. 3(g) shows the PDF G(r) data with multiple oscillations defined solely in the low-r region, suggesting the confined size of Pt NPs across the entire range of catalysts. Notably, the G(r) oscillation peaks for Pt50/OX72R display a faster decay in the range of wt% 10 Å, indicating characteristics of ultrasmall size. The first four peaks located at ~2.75, ~3.9, ~4.77, and ~5.51 Å represent the Pt–Pt bonds from various scattering paths (inset of Fig. 3(g)). The comparison of these peak positions reveals a smaller Pt–Pt atom-pair distance in Pt50/OX72R. For instance, taking path 1 in the right part of Fig. 3(g) as an example, the Pt-Pt bond distance is determined being 2.73 Å for Pt50/OX72R, which is highly consistent with the results of EXAFS fitting. This slight contraction in bond length relative to Pt50/72R can be attributed to the strong electronic interactions between Pt NPs and oxygenic functional groups. More detailed structural information is summarized in Table S4, derived from fitting the G(r) data using PDFgui with a Pt Fm3m space group model. The green lines in Fig. 3(g) illustrate the differences between the calculated and experimental functions, indicating that they are in good agreement. The sizes of Pt NPs for Pt50/72R and Pt50/OX72R, as determined by fitting, are in strong agreement with those calculated using Scherer's formula. Additionally, contact angle measurements were conducted to evaluate the surface wetting properties of the samples. The water contact angle images taken at different time for Pt50/72R and Pt50/OX72R are shown in Fig. 3(i). While Pt50/72R is typically hydrophilic, Pt50/OX72R demonstrates superhydrophilicity as indicated by rapidly soaking of water droplets into its surface and correspondingly a nearly zero contact angle. Although pore volume shrinkage occurs in Pt50/OX72R, the improved surface hydrophilicity is indispensable for oxygenic functional groups, which have strong interaction with water molecules [ 48 ]. The superhydrophilic nature of Pt50/OX72R comparing with Pt50/72R can facilitate faster bubble detachment, improve the contact between the electrolyte and the catalyst surface, and thereby enhances catalytic performance [ 49,50 ]. 3.4 HER catalytic performance The HER electrocatalytic performance of the as-synthesized high-loading Pt/C catalysts (Pt40/OX72R, Pt50/OX72R, Pt60/OX72R and Pt70/OX72R) and the commercial Pt/C catalysts (40 wt%, Com-40Pt/C and 60 wt%, Com-60Pt/C) as references was evaluated in an H-type cell with a fixed catalyst loading. Fig. 4(a) illustrates the LSV polarization curves at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 with 90% iR compensation. The sequence of HER activity from high to low is Pt70/OX72R wt% Pt60/OX72R wt% Pt50/OX72R wt% Com-60Pt/C wt% Pt40/OX72R wt% Com-40Pt/C. Apparently, the performance of the as-synthesized Pt60/OX72R and Pt40/OX72R catalysts is significantly superior to that of the commercial Com-60Pt/C and Com-40Pt/C catalysts, respectively. Even when the Pt loading of as-synthesized Pt50/OX72R is lower than that of Com-60Pt/C, the Pt50/OX72R catalyst still demonstrates better catalytic activity, which is closely associated with its smaller particle size and higher dispersion. For a more comprehensive comparison, the precise overpotentials of all Pt/C catalysts at varying current densities are summarized in Fig. 4(b). Notably, Pt70/OX72R exhibits an exceptionally low overpotential of 39 mV at a high current density of 100 mA cm–2, positioning it as a promising candidate for industrial electrolytic water catalysis. The Tafel slopes of all catalysts are derived from the corresponding polarization curves to investigate the HER kinetics of the as-prepared Pt/C catalysts (Fig. 4(c)). The Pt60/OX72R and Pt70/OX72R exhibit comparable Tafel slopes of only 11.02, and 11.64 mV dec–1, which are smaller than the Com-60Pt/C (12.89 mV dec–1). This implies that the as-synthesized high-loading Pt/C catalysts exhibit faster HER reaction rate through the typical Volmer-Tafel mechanism. As shown in Fig. S25, the C dl was calculated from relevant CV curves in the non-Faradaic potential region at different scan rates to evaluate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). In comparison to Com-40Pt/C and Com-60Pt/C, the Pt40/OX72R and Pt60/OX72R samples exhibit significantly higher C dl values, indicating a larger ECSA and enhanced electrocatalytic performance (Fig. 4(d)). This improvement can be attributed to the higher dispersion and smaller size of the Pt NPs in Pt40/OX72R and Pt60/OX72R, which provide more accessible active sites. EIS was conducted to investigate the interfacial electron transfer kinetics. As shown in Fig. 4(e), the charge transfer resistance (R ct) of these catalysts exhibits a trend consistent with the LSV results. The as-synthesized high-loading Pt/C catalysts demonstrate faster electron transfer rates due to the stronger interactions between the Pt NPs and the carbon support comparing with the commercial ones. In addition to activity, the stability is a crucial parameter to evaluate catalyst performance. The long-term stability of all as-synthesized high-loading Pt/C catalysts and the Com-40Pt/C catalyst was evaluated by applying continuous cathodic current densities of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm–2, while recording the potential changes over time. As clearly illustrated in Fig. 4(f), the potential profiles of Pt40/OX72R, Pt50/OX72R, Pt60/OX72R, and Pt70/OX72R remain stable during the 30 h continuous test with negligible potential decay, demonstrating remarkable durability. It is worth noting that although the potential profile of Com-40Pt/C remains stable, a slight decline is observed at a current density of 100 mA cm–2, a phenomenon not seen in Pt40/OX72R. The calculated voltage decay rates are 2 mV h–1 for the Com-40Pt/C and 0.1 mV h–1 for the as-synthesized Pt40/OX72R. These results clearly demonstrate that the durability of Pt40/OX72R. This observation indicates that the durability of Pt40/OX72R surpasses that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, highlighting its excellent potential for industrial applications. Moreover, Fig. S26 compares the LSV curves of Pt40/OX72R and Pt40/72R before and after the accelerated durability test (ADT). After 10000 CV cycles from –0.2 to 0 V (versus RHE) at a sweep rate of 100 mV s–1, the HER polarization curve of Pt40/OX72R shows minimal degradation with only 3 mV potential drop at 50 mA cm–2, confirming the excellent durability of this catalyst. In contrast, the Pt40/72R exhibits an obvious overpotential shift in polarization curves, and 15 mV potential drop at 50 mA cm–2 is observed. The samples collected after ADT were characterized using TEM to further investigate their structural and mechanical stability. As depicted in Fig. S27, the Pt NPs in the reacted Pt40/72R have migrated, leading to increased particle size from 3.54 to 5.25 nm and agglomeration level. This phenomenon can be attributed to the weak metal-support interaction between the Pt NPs and the carbon support in the Pt40/72R catalyst, which is insufficient to prevent particle migration. Furthermore, the size distribution of the Pt NPs in the Pt40/72R is inhomogeneous, making Ostwald ripening more likely to occur during the ADT process, resulting in larger particle sizes. In stark contrast, Pt40/OX72R can well maintain its initial morphology after the test. Post-reaction TEM images (Fig. S28) confirm that the Pt NPs are evenly dispersed without obvious agglomeration, with the negligible average particle size increasing. These results further substantiate the strong interaction between the Pt NPs and the oxidized carbon support, which is essential for ensuring both high activity and excellent stability in Pt/C electrocatalysts. 3.5 PEM electrolyser performance Given the superior HER performance of the as-synthesized high-loading Pt/C catalysts in a three-electrode system, we further assembled a PEMWE single cell to evaluate their performance for industrial applications. The membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were constructed by applying Pt40/OX72R and Pt60/OX72R as cathode catalysts, and commercial IrO2 as the anode catalysts on both sides of the proton exchange membranes. For comparative purposes, MEAs utilizing commercial Pt/C (Com-40Pt/C and Com-60Pt/C) as cathode catalysts were prepared under identical conditions. Fig. 5(a) presents an image of a PEMWE cell that pumps in deionized water and operates at the temperature of 60 °C. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the polarization curves indicate that the Pt40/OX72R and Pt60/OX72R cathode-coated PEMWEs exhibit enhanced water electrolysis activity in comparison to Com-40Pt/C and Com-60Pt/C cathode-coated PEMWEs, respectively. Specifically, the device based on Pt40/OX72R catalyst generates a current density of 1 A cm–2 at a cell voltage of 1.83 V, which is lower than the 1.88 V required by the Com-40Pt/C based device. In the case of the Pt60/OX72R based device, a low cell voltage of 1.77 V is required to produce a current density of 1 A cm–2, representing a reduction of 45 mV compared to the Com-60Pt/C based device. Moreover, the stability of PEM electrolyzers utilizing Pt60/OX72R and Com-60Pt/C as cathode catalysts was assessed through galvanostatic electrolysis. The stability of the PEM cell is influenced by various factors, particularly the anode catalyst, which operates in a harsher environment. Consequently, our stability tests were conducted over a shorter duration to ensure an accurate assessment of the Pt/C catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5(c), both devices exhibit stable operational voltage profiles at the high current density of 1 A cm–2 for over 100 hours. Notably, the cell voltage degradation rate of the Pt60/OX72R electrolyzer was 50 μV h–1, which is only one-quarter of the Com-60Pt/C electrolyzer (200 μV h–1). This indicates that the as-synthesized high-loading Pt/C catalysts demonstrate outstanding durability in the practical application of PEMWE. These results fully highlight the significant application potential in PEMWE of the as-synthesized high-loading Pt/C catalysts for green hydrogen production. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, we have developed a facile and effective HTS pyrolysis method to synthesize highly dispersed and small sized Pt/C electrocatalysts with high metal loadings from 39.01 wt% to 66.48 wt%. Benefiting from the ultrafast heating and cooling of HTS, sub-2.5 nm Pt NPs without aggregation has been successfully grown directly on functionalized Vulcan 72R carbon supports with a high loading efficiency exceeding 95%. Comprehensive characterization reveals that oxidation treatment increases the specific surface area and pore volume of 72R carbon black, introduces abundant structural defects and oxygenic functional groups, and facilitates the efficient load of ultrasmall Pt NPs. When supplied for acidic HER, the as-synthesized high-loading Pt/C catalysts demonstrate superior activity and stability comparing with the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalysts. Taking 60 wt% loading Pt/C as an example, the Pt60/OX72R catalyst reaches a high current density of 100 mA cm–2 at the overpotential of 44 mV, which is 8 mV lower than that of Com-60Pt/C. The PEMWE cell employing Pt60/OX72R as the cathodic catalyst and commercial IrO2 as the anode catalyst delivers both a cell voltage of 1.77 V at 1 A cm–2 and high stability indicated by the operation for over 100 h with a voltage decay rate of 50 μV h–1. The superior performance of the as-synthesized high-loading Pt/C catalysts can be ascribed to the ultrasmall size and uniform dispersion of Pt NPs, optimized electronic structure of Pt site by oxygenic functional groups, superhydrophilicity facilitating contact between the electrolyte and the catalyst surface, and strengthened metal-support interaction to prevent particle migration and growth. This work provides a rapid, general and cost-effective approach for large-scale production of a broad range of high-loading carbon supported metal nanoparticles.

        "dc:description": "High-loading Pt/C catalysts play an important role in the fabrication of membrane electrode assemblies with thin catalytic layer, which enhance mass transport and maintain the balance of water and heat. Unfortunately, as the loading increases, the agglomeration and growth of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) occur, causing unsatisfactory performance. Here, we present an efficient method for preparing of highly dispersed and small-sized Pt/C catalysts with Pt loadings varying from 39.01 wt% to 66.48 wt% through the high-temperature shock technique. The high density and ultrafine (~2.5 nm) Pt NPs are successfully anchored onto Vulcan XC-72R carbon black without the use of additional capping agents or surfactants. The modified carbon supports enhance the affinity for Pt precursors, contributing to loading efficiencies of 95% or more, while also providing abundant sites for the nucleation and fixation of Pt NPs, thus preventing agglomeration. In the context of the hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic media, the as-synthesized high-loading Pt/C catalysts show remarkable activity and stability, outperforming the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C. This is mainly because the combined effects of ultrasmall and uniform Pt NPs, optimized electronic structure of Pt site, superhydrophilicity and effective anchoring of Pt NPs. The polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer integrated with Pt60/OX72R and commercial IrO2 reaches 1 A cm–2 at 1.77 V and operates stably for 120 hours with a negligible voltage decay. This new strategy is fast, scalable and cost-effective for large-scale production of metal-supported catalysts, especially for the high-loading ones.",
