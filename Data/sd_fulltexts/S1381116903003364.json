Graphic The nature of the cobalt centers in oxidized and reduced CoO x /Al2O3 catalysts and in oxidized Co-H-mordenite (Co-H-MOR) have been characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy and by IR spectroscopy. The UV-Vis spectroscopy of CoO x /Al2O3 catalysts is dominated by the features of divalent cobalt in tetrahedral coordination. These sites can be reduced by hydrogen to cobalt metal centers that have been characterized by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed carbon monoxide. The surface of CoO x /Al2O3 when it is in contact with CO/H2 mixtures and works as the catalyst for hydrocarbon synthesis has also been characterized by IR. Surface formate species were detected that could act as reaction intermediates. The active sites of Co-H-MOR are also constituted by tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ that act as medium strong Lewis sites. The presence of Co species seems to cause a slight increase of the average Brønsted acidity of the residual hydroxy groups in Co-H-MOR samples. Keywords Cobalt-alumina Co-H-MOR CO adsorption Spectroscopic characterization 1 Introduction Cobalt is a very active element in different fields of catalysis. Organometallic cobalt complexes are known since many years as excellent homogeneous catalysts [1] for hydroformilation and different carbonylation, hydrogenation and isomerization reactions [2]. Like for other organometallic complexes, these materials can be supported on solid carriers giving rise to heterogenized homogeneous catalysts [3] or precursors for supported metal catalysts [4]. Alternatively, cobalt-based catalysts can be prepared by more conventional impregnation, coprecipitation and ion exchange techniques. In any case, supported complexes can be used as models for the surface species observed, in different conditions, over solid catalysts. Heterogeneous cobalt-based catalysts have several applications in the chemical industry and have been investigated for several different reactions. In fact, due to the redox properties of cobalt species, they can be applied in the reduced state for hydrogenation reactions, but also in the oxidized state for oxidation. In particular, reduced Co catalysts are active for CO hydrogenation to methanol and higher alcohols [5] and to hydrocarbons, in the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis process [6]. In the former case, good selectivities to linear higher alcohols can be obtained, while in the latter case, good activity/selectivity properties in hydrocarbons synthesis and, at the same time, higher resistance to oxidation and low water-gas shift activity are observed. Deactivation processes, however, are reported, mainly attributed to re-oxidation of metal centers by water [7,8], one of the FT process products. Bartholomew indicated in his review on catalyst deactivation [9] a need for further investigation on partial oxidation on complex oxides for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. Various studies, applying several analytic techniques, have also been performed over the nature of the interaction between Co ions and the support [10], the reducibility of Co species [11], their dispersion, the influence of calcination temperature [12]. Oxidized cobalt species are active for several oxidation reactions, such as total oxidation of hydrocarbons [13] and of ammonia to NO [14]. Co containing zeolites are active in hydrocarbon ammoxidation [15] and for reducing NO with methane in oxidizing atmosphere [16,17] so allowing the denitrification (DeNOxing) of waste gases. Co2+ ions exchanging the protons of the protonic zeolites are considered to be the active sites [13,18]. Recently, it has been proposed that a cooperation between the transition metal cations and Brønsted acid sites can occur upon CH4-SCR. According to Yan et al. [19] Co cations act in the oxidation of NO to NO2 while Brønsted sites act in the true reduction step by methane. On the contrary, Kauchy et al. [17] suggest that Brønsted sites enhance the activity in oxidizing NO to NO2. Strong drawbacks are the hydrothermal instability of these catalysts [20], their poisoning by SO x [21] and just their strong activity in oxidizing NO to NO2 [22]. In the present paper, we report some results of spectroscopic studies carried on two Co-containing catalytic systems: an alumina supported system, 15.5wt.% Co on Al2O3, which is active for hydrocarbon synthesis from CO and hydrogen, and a partially exchanged mordenite (Co-H-MOR) which is active in hydrocarbons oxidation and in the SCR of NO by methane. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of catalysts The sample CoO x /Al2O3 (15.5wt.% Co) has been prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of γ-Al2O3 support with (CH3COO)2Co·4H2O aqueous solution followed by calcination at 673K for 3h. The catalyst has a mean pore diameter of 40Å and a surface area of 150m2/g. The sample Co-H-MOR was synthesized through an ion exchange process. NH4-MOR (SiO2/Al2O3=20; S BET=480m2/g), supplied by Zeolyst was contacted with a 0.02M (CH3COO)2Co·4H2O aqueous solution (10g powder for 1l solution) under stirring at a constant temperature of 353K for 24h. The resulting mixture was filtered and washed for three times with bi-distilled water. After centrifugation, the powder was dried at 353K for 10h and calcined at 823K for 4h (resulting surface area=430m2/g). 2.2 Characterization Diffuse reflectance spectra (DR-UV-Vis-NIR) of pure self-supported sample powder disks have been recorded in the wavenumber range 50,000–4000cm−1 by a Jasco V-570 at room temperature in air, and after dehydration at 773K for 5h by outgassing through a conventional gas manipulation/outgassing ramp connected to a quartz cell. The IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Protégé 460 and on a Nicolet Magna 750 Fourier transform instruments. The surface characterization has been performed using pressed disks of pure powders (15mg), activated by outgassing at 773 or 673K (cobalt-alumina catalyst) into the IR cell. A conventional manipulation/outgassing ramp connected to the IR cell was used. The adsorption/desorption process of different probe molecules on the catalyst surfaces has been studied through FT-IR spectroscopy. CO was chosen to characterize Co/Al2O3. Before CO adsorption the cobalt-alumina sample has been submitted to an “in situ” reduction pretreatment, i.e. heating in vacuum (10−2 Pa) at 673K followed by reducing cycles in pure hydrogen at the same temperature. The reducing treatment (critical for the experiment) will be specified in the result section. For Co-H-MOR spectra were collected after activation procedure and after adsorption of acetonitrile (AN), supplied by Aldrich and distilled under vacuum prior to use. The adsorption procedure involves contact of the activated samples disk with vapors at room temperature at a pressure of 2kPa and outgassing in steps at room temperature and increasing temperatures. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 UV-Vis spectroscopic characterization: CoOx/Al2O3 The UV-Vis spectrum of the CoO x /Al2O3 fresh sample in air shows a very broad absorption centered near 25,000cm−1, a sharper one centered near 15,000cm−1 and a multiple one centered near 7500cm−1 (Fig. 1a ). For comparison we reported in the same figure the UV spectra recorded in air of cobalt aluminate CoAl2O4 (Fig. 1d) and of the oxide Co3O4 (Fig. 1c) powder. Note that both CoAl2O4 and Co3O4 are essentially normal spinels, so with Co2+ mainly if not exclusively in tetrahedral coordination and Al3+ or Co3+ in octahedral coordination. The absorption of the support γ-Al2O3 (which is also a defective spinel structure) is negligible in the same region. The spectra are quite close in all cases, however the peaks differ significantly in shape and relative intensity. In particular, Co3O4 shows the maximum of the broad band at higher energies (28,000cm−1) and the band itself is stronger than for CoAl2O4 and fresh CoO x /Al2O3. Experimental studies and crystal field calculations [23–25] allow to assign the absorptions near 25,000, 15,000 and 7500cm−1 to different d–d transitions of tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+.The absorption near 28,000cm−1 which is evident in the spectrum of Co3O4 could be due to octahedral Co3+. This comparison suggests that the spectrum of fresh CoO x /Al2O3 is dominated too by the absorptions of tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ similar to those of cobalt aluminate, while upon further calcinations (Fig. 1b) trivalent cobalt or Co3O4 are formed. 3.2 UV-Vis spectroscopic characterization: Co-H-MOR The UV-Vis spectrum of the Co-H-MOR sample, recorded in air, is shown in Fig. 1e. Absorptions due to Co n+ can be clearly seen also in the spectra of cobalt-containing MOR, as a very strong broad band centered near 23,000cm−1 and two shoulders near 28,000 and 16,000cm−1. The spectrum does not give evidence for the presence of massive Co3O4, due to the absence of the absorption centered near 7500cm−1, present only in traces if any. The main absorption can be associated to octahedrally coordinated Co2+ aquo or hydroxo ions [23], while the shoulder at higher frequencies could be due to Co3+ ions. After evacuation at 773K for 5h the spectrum does not show anymore the very strong and broad adsorption observed in the ambient conditions spectrum. On the contrary, weaker absorptions are found which can be interpreted as a triplet near 19,000, 17,000 and 15,000cm−1. The spectrum we observe in this region is closely similar to those reported and deeply discussed by Dedechek and Wichterlová [26] and Drozdova et al. [27] for Co-H-MOR and are also similar to those already observed by Kauchy et al. [28], Dedechek et al. [29] and us [22] for both Co-H-MFI and Co-H-FER. These authors assigned the spectra to bare Co2+ in three different exchanged positions in the zeolites cavities. 3.3 IR characterization: CoOx/Al2O3 pure powder spectra In Fig. 2 , the IR spectra of pressed disks of the pure CoO x /Al2O3 sample after activation by outgassing (a) and after reduction with hydrogen 400Torr at 673K for 2h (b and c) are reported. Activation by outgassing and by reduction causes the disappearance of bands at 1552 and 1309cm−1 due to residual carbonates. Reduction with hydrogen causes a strong increase of the transmittance of the sample. This has already been observed for cobalt oxide [30] and it can be due to the reduction of the semiconductivity behavior of this material. Both activation procedures cause the appearance of sharp bands at 3767, 3728 and 3670cm−1 (Fig. 2, inset) typically observed also on activated γ-Al2O3 [31] due to free surface hydroxy groups bonded to Al ions. No evidence is found of bands due to OH coordinated over Co ions. 3.4 IR study of CO adsorption over oxidized CoOx/Al2O3 catalyst The spectra of the surface species arising from CO adsorption at room temperature over the fresh CoO x /Al2O3 catalyst are reported in Fig. 3a . Immediately after CO adsorption two main bands are detected at 2190 and at 2130cm−1, the latter being broad and complex, with a shoulder at 2170cm−1. If contact with CO gas is carried out longer at room temperature (Fig. 3b), the band at higher wavenumbers decreases in intensity until it disappears while the complex band at lower wavenumbers is better defined into three components, the last one being shifted towards lower frequencies. The band at 2190cm−1, decreasing with time, is likely due to CO coordinated over surface Co3+ [30]. The simultaneous growth of bands at 2350cm−1, due to adsorbed CO2, and at 1620, 1437 and 1227cm−1 due to bicarbonate species is certainly associated to CO oxidation over Co3+ ions which are partially reduced. The complex band around 2130cm−1 can also be assigned to CO coordinated over ionic Co (likely Co2+) [30,32]. The evidence of different components in the IR absorption bands can be due to the presence of cobalt ions in different environment. 3.5 IR study of CO adsorption over reduced Co/Al2O3 catalyst CO adsorption has also been performed over the “mildly” reduced catalyst with 400Torr of hydrogen at 473K and at increasing contact time (Fig. 3c and d). A quite strong doublet due to CO stretching modes are detected at 2168 and 2157cm−1, associated to terminal carbonyls formed over cobalt ions [33]. Other weak features are detectable at lower frequencies, immediately after CO adsorption, around 2080 and 1995cm−1, together with a component around 1790cm−1. Increasing contact time leads to the progressive decrease of the higher frequency bands, and to the broadening of the band around 1800cm−1. Following literature data [34–37], the two bands at 2080 and 1995cm−1 are ascribed to terminal carbonyls on reduced Co centers like Co δ+–CO and Co0–CO, while the band at 1800cm−1 is assigned to bridging CO species over metallic Co. The sample has also been submitted to a eight cycles of reduction and outgassing at 673K in order to limit the contact between water (formed by reduction with hydrogen) and cobalt at the surface. After this treatment the surface is almost completely dehydroxylated. The spectrum we obtained after contact with CO (Fig. 3e and f) clearly shows the presence of reduced metal centers according to the presence of terminal carbonyls absorbing at 2037 and 2004cm−1. Bands due to hydrogenocarbonate species are also detected. 3.6 Study of the surface species and gas phase product under CO/H2 mixture After reduction in hydrogen, the sample has been put in contact with 86kPa of a CO/H2 (1:2) mixture. The catalyst has been heated at increasing temperature and the spectra of both the catalyst surface (Fig. 4 , bottom) and the gas phase (Fig. 4, top) have been recorded at each temperature. In the gas phase, reaction products can be detected starting from 473K: at this temperature, it is possible to detect weak and sharp bands at 3016 and 1305cm−1 due to CH stretching and deformation of methane gas. Their intensity increases at increasing temperatures reaching a “plateau” at 673K, where these bands are predominant in the spectrum. The careful study of the low frequency region of the gas phase spectra also reveals the presence of new sharp bands (see the enlargement in the inset of Fig. 4, top). At 473K bands at 989cm−1 (very weak, CH2 twisting mode of propene), 949cm−1 (CH2 wagging mode of ethylene) and 912cm−1 (CH2 wagging mode of propene) are detected. At increasing temperature (523K) the band of ethylene at 949cm−1 becomes predominant while new bands at 890cm−1 (CH2 wagging mode of isobutene) and at 923cm−1 (CH2 wagging mode of 1-butene) are present, whose intensity is constant even following a further increase of temperature. The high frequency region of the spectra shows complex but weak bands around 2800 and 2900cm−1, partially masked by the strong absorption of methane, associated to several hydrocarbons. Carbon dioxide and water are also observed. This shows that the material is now working as a catalyst for the synthesis of hydrocarbons. Looking at the catalyst (Fig. 4, bottom), at room temperature weak bands due to hydrogenocarbonate species are the only features after the contact of CO+H2. At 473K bands at 1630, 1593, 1394 and 1376cm−1 have been detected, indicating the presence of adsorbed water (broad band at 1630cm−1) and, in agreement with Khassin et al. [38], formate species (asymmetric and symmetric COO stretchings at 1593 and 1376cm−1, CH deformation at 1394cm−1) likely interacting with reduced cobalt. Formate adsorbed over Co3O4 [13] or on the alumina [39] support have been reported at slightly different wavenumbers. The band intensity increases reaching a maximum at 523K, then these bands disappear between 523 and 573K. The weak and sharp band at 1305cm−1 is due to physisorbed methane, still evident in the spectra recorded in the presence of methane in the gas phase even after the subtraction of the corresponding gas phase spectra. The negative band centered below 1000cm−1 is a common feature in the case of reactants adsorption over alumina surface and is due to AlO bands perturbation with respect to the same bands in the activated surface spectrum. In the 2500–1700cm−1 region, a complex band with a maximum at 2030cm−1 appears at 523K, together with a weak broad absorption near 1800cm−1. The position of these band is typical of linear and bridging carbonyls over Co metal species, as discussed in previous paragraph. It is worth to note that these reduced Co surface sites become detectable at this temperature, i.e. higher than the temperature at which methane starts to be observed in the gas (473K) and their appearance parallels the formation of ethylene and propene in gas phase and the detection of maximum of formate species at the surface. At increasing temperature (i.e. between 523 and 573K) a component seems to grow at 2015cm−1, simultaneously to the decrease of the component at 2030cm−1. This could be the result of the evolution of the morphology of the Co metal particles. 3.7 IR study of the residual Brønsted sites on Co-H-mordenite The IR spectrum of the OH stretching bands of hydroxyl groups of the activated Co-containing zeolite is compared to that of the corresponding H-zeolite in Fig. 5 . As discussed elsewhere [40], the spectrum of H-MOR shows a very sharp band at 3745cm−1 which is due to the terminal silanol groups located on the external surface and weakly acidic; at least another broad component is present roughly centered at 3730cm−1. The very strong band at 3605cm−1, is due to the bridging SiOHAl groups that are exclusively on the inner surface and possess a strong Brønsted acidity. Such band is characterized by a tail towards lower frequencies, due to the bridging OHs located in the so-called side-pockets [40]. The component near 3650cm−1 is due to extraframework species. The Co-exchanged MOR sample shows the same bands but with a loss of intensity, apart from the extraframework species bands that seems not to be affected by the ion exchange process. The absolute intensity of the band of the external silanol groups is near 89% with respect to that of the unexchanged material, while concerning the band of the internal bridging the residual OHs band is just 33% of the original one. This suggests that Co exchange has been only partial although nearly 66% of the internal OHs has been actually exchanged. 3.8 IR study of CO adsorption over oxidized Co-H-MOR CO adsorption at room temperature over the oxidized catalysts provide evidence for the existence of Co2+ ions (band centered at 2205cm−1 in the IR spectrum), thus confirming UV data. Moreover, following recent literature results [41], we have been able to detect bands due to polycarbonyl species over Co+, possibly Co+(CO)3. The contemporary presence of a band due to adsorbed CO2 points out the CO oxidation over cobalt ions, which are partially reduced. 3.9 IR study of the adsorption of acetonitrile on Co-H-MOR To test whether the partial exchange with cobalt modified the acidity of the residual OHs and if Co sites are actually accessible, we investigated the adsorption of AN on them (Fig. 6 ). This is a weak base which cannot, in contrast to CO, reduce cobalt centers. Fig. 6 shows the subtraction spectra of H-MOR (spectrum a) and Co-H-MOR (spectrum b) after the adsorption of AN, and evacuation at room temperature for 10min in order to eliminate the excess vapor (the spectra of the activated samples have been subtracted). After the interaction with AN, both the band at 3745cm−1 and the one at 3605cm−1 have disappeared. As previously reported [36], the adsorption of AN on the surface of H-MOR and of many other protonic zeolites [42] perturbs entirely the OH groups; the perturbation of the bridging hydroxyl groups, in particular, gives rise to the so-called ABC pattern: two intense and broad bands at around 2800 and 2400cm−1, a less intense one at around 1600cm−1 and a window with a minimum at around 2600cm−1, corresponding to ∼2δOH. Such pattern has been assigned to very strong quasi-symmetrical hydrogen bonding where the proton is partially but not completely transferred to the base. It arises from the Fermi resonance between νOH, and the δOH and γOH overtones when the acidic bridging OH groups strongly interact with bases. It is evident that the ABC spectrum is very strong in the case of H-MOR and corresponds to the strong negative band at 3605cm−1. Both these features are by far weaker for Co-H-MOR in the subtraction spectra just because most of the internal OHs have been exchanged. Additionally, the exchange with Co in the zeolite seems to have caused a small (5–10cm−1) but significant shift down of the overall ABC spectrum. This should correspond to an increased average acidity of the residual hydroxyl groups, either due to a direct effect of Co2+ species on the acidity of the residual OHs or to a easier exchange of the weaker acidic OHs. In the inset of Fig. 6, the spectra of adsorbed species arising from AN adsorption on the catalysts are shown in the 2600–2000cm−1 region: the spectra of activated samples have been subtracted. The spectra have been collected after evacuation step at 473K, to reveal quite strongly adsorbed species; the analyses of the exchanged and not exchanged mordenite are compared also with the spectrum of liquid AN. At 473K, the presence of water eventually adsorbed should be negligible and not interfering with the analysis. In the 2600–2000cm−1 range of wavenumbers, liquid acetonitrile shows a strong doublet at 2294 and 2254cm−1; the latter band is definitely stronger than the former. They are due to Fermi resonance between the CN stretching and a δCH3+νCC combination. This characteristic pattern changes when the CN group adsorbs on an acidic surface: the stronger the electron-withdrawal effect of either Brønsted or Lewis site to which the N lone pair interacts the larger the shift upwards of the components and their relative intensity inversion, as previously reported [43]. AN adsorbed on H-zeolite gives rise to a quite complex and weak group of bands in these conditions. The doublet at 2335 and 2306cm−1 has been assigned to the AN interacting with extraframework Al Lewis sites, which are very strong Lewis acids. Actually, part of the component at 2306cm−1 and the further band at 2290cm−1 arise from the doublet due to AN strongly H-bonded with surface OHs, and still present in part after outgassing at 473K. The spectrum relative to Co-H-MOR appears significantly different from that of the H-precursor. It shows a single very strong doublet at 2319 and 2290cm−1, which resists outgassing at 473K, characterized by a comparable intensity of the two components. This doublet is certainly due to AN interacting with the naked Co sites typical of the Co-exchanged zeolites as already reported by our group for Co-H-FER and Co-H-MFI [22]. This spectrum characterizes the Co2+ of Co-H-MOR as medium strong Lewis acid sites. 4 Conclusions The results reported in this paper allow to draw some conclusions on the chemistry of cobalt at the surface of two different supports of catalytic interest, i.e. alumina and the mordenite zeolite. Our data show that surface of oxidized CoO x /Al2O3 presents Co in both divalent and trivalent states. However, the UV-Vis spectra are dominated by the absorptions of tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ similar to that of CoAl2O4. By calcination the amount of Co3+ seems to increase. On the contrary, treatment in hydrogen shows the progressive reduction of Co centers, up to Co0 that can produce both linear and bridging carbonyls by adsorption of CO. Data obtained under CO/H2 mixtures suggest that extended Co metal is necessary for the formation of the olefins ethylene, propene, n-butene and isobutene, while methane, which is formed in big amounts, is possibly formed also on only partially reduced surfaces. The detection of formate species under reaction conditions can suggest that these species are intermediates in the reaction. In fact, these species are per se thermally labile at the temperature at which they are detected in the presence of CO and hydrogen. UV-Vis spectra show that octahedrally coordinated Co2+ aquo or hydroxo ions are likely predominant on Co-H-MOR under ambient conditions. These species convert into tetrahedrally coordinated Lewis acidic Co2+ species by outgassing. These species are characterized by a typical UV-Vis spectrum (probably due to three different spectra related to three different exchange positions) but also by the formation, after adsorption of acetonitrile, of a strongly bonded and well characterized acetonitrile–Co2+ complex. The presence of cobalt is also likely to cause an increase of the average Brønsted strength of the residual hydroxy groups. The coupling of UV-Vis and FT-IR spectroscopy techniques allows a detailed characterization of the active sites of these catalysts and also the study of the catalyst in working conditions.

The surface of CoO x /Al2O3 when it is in contact with CO/H2 mixtures and works as the catalyst for hydrocarbon synthesis has also been characterized by IR.
