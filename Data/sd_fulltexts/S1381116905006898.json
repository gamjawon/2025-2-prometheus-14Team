Graphical abstract The 5wt% Na2WO4–2wt%Mn/SiO2 catalysts prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method, mixture slurry method and sol–gel method have been comparatively studied for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). The structural properties of the catalysts have been characterised using XRD, XPS, O2-TPD and BET methods. The catalyst prepared by the mixture slurry method has an excellent stability and can alleviate the loss of active components during a 500h run. The 5wt% Na2WO4–2wt% Mn/SiO2 catalysts have been prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method, mixture slurry method and sol–gel method, and their catalytic performances for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) are evaluated in a continuous micro-reactor. 30% of CH4 conversion and 70% of C2 selectivity have been obtained in methane-oxygen co-feed without any dilutes over these catalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies indicate that the main crystallite phases of catalysts are Mn2O3, Na2WO4 and α-cristobalite, and different precursors of silica are transformed ultimately into highly crystallite α-cristobalite. XPS results show that Na, W and Mn are mainly distributed on the surface of catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method, but more uniform between the surface and bulk on the catalysts prepared by other two methods. Comparing with the catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method, that of prepared by the mixture slurry method has an excellent stability and can alleviate the loss of active components during a 500h run. Structure changes indicate that α-cristobalite is not indispensable for effective Na2WO4–Mn/SiO2 catalysts. Keywords Na2WO4–Mn/SiO2 catalyst Oxidative coupling of methane Prepared method 1 Introduction The Na2WO4–Mn/SiO2 catalyst, firstly reported by Li and his co-workers [1–3], has been known to be one of the most effective catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). In a single-pass operation, 66.9% C2 selectivity at 37.7% CH4 conversion with 2.6 C2H4/C2H6 ratio was obtained [1]. 81% C2 selectivity at 20% CH4 conversion and 80% C2 selectivity at 33% CH4 conversion over this catalyst had been reproduced by Lunsford [4] and Lambert [5], respectively. At an elevated pressure, the catalyst exhibited not only the same catalytic activity and C2 selectivity, but also a higher ratio of C2H4 to C2H6 when the space velocity was increased [6]. More recently, CeO2 and SnO2 promoted Na–W–Mn/SiO2 catalysts for the oxidative conversion of methane have been studied in a micro-stainless-steel reactor under elevated pressure [7–9]. A CH4 conversion of 47.2% with a C2 C4 selectivity of 47.3% (C2:C3:C4 =1:1:3.3) was obtained at 710°C with 1.0×105 mlg−1 h−1 GHSV, CH4 /O2 =2.5, and P =0.6MPa. The reaction mechanism of OCM is very complicated and considerable controversies concerning the nature of the active centre in the catalyst exist. In the case of Na–W–Mn/SiO2 catalyst Li [10] proposed a two metal active site model for OCM reaction. In this model it was believed that the active oxygen species was surface lattice oxygen Os 2−, and the redox mechanism involving two metal sites, W6+/5+ and Mn3+/2+, could be used to explain CH4 and O2 activation. CH4 was activated by Os 2− to generate CH3 radical on W6+/5+ site, and the electron transferred from W6+/5+ site to Mn3+/2+ site, which was responsible for molecular oxygen activation to form surface lattice oxygen Os 2− as an active oxygen species for CH4 activation. By comparison with catalytic behaviours of Na2WO4–Mn/SiO2, Na2WO4–Mn/MgO, and NaMnO4/MgO catalysts, Lunsford and co-workers [4,11] suggested that Na–O–Mn species were the most probable active sites, in which Mn was an active component, Na provides selectivity, and W was required to stabilize the catalyst. Lambert and co-workers [5,12] emphasized that the phase transition from amorphous silica to α-cristobalite was a crucially important requirement for the production of effective catalyst, and they proposed that Na played a dual role as both structural and chemical promoter. Recently, Ji et al. [13,14] proposed that both Na–O–Mn and Na–O–W acted as the active centres of Na2WO4–Mn/SiO2 catalysts, in which there was a synergic effect of sodium, tungsten, and manganese components, and the WO4 tetrahedron on the catalyst surface appeared to play an essential role in achieving high CH4 conversion and high C2 hydrocarbon selectivity in the OCM reaction. Nevertheless, in the previous studies, Na2WO4–Mn/SiO2 catalyst was usually prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method, which made the active components were enriched on the catalyst surface and tend to loss during extended times on stream. In this paper, the effect of Na2WO4–Mn/SiO2 catalysts prepared by different methods for OCM reaction was studied in detail. The essential aims were to explore appropriate method to prepare active and stable Na2WO4–Mn/SiO2 catalyst, and on the other hand, to further complement the understanding of Na2WO4–Mn/SiO2 catalyst from the point of preparation methods. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The 5wt% Na2WO4–2wt% Mn/SiO2 catalysts for OCM reaction were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method, mixture slurry method and sol–gel method, and the three catalysts were denoted by W–Mn/SiO2 (A), W–Mn/SiO2 (B) and W–Mn/SiO2 (C), respectively. All chemicals involved during preparation of catalysts included: silica particles (Qindao Ocean Chemical Plant, China), Mn(NO3)2 (50% Mn(NO3)2, A.R., Beijing Chemical Plant, China), Na2WO4·2H2O (A.R., Beijing Jinghua Chemical Plant, China), and (C2H5)4SiO4 (A.R., Shanghai Chemical Plant, China). 2.1.1 W–Mn/SiO2 (A): the incipient wetness impregnation method The silica particles (40–60 mesh) were impregnated with the aqueous solutions of Mn(NO3)2 and Na2WO4·2H2O in appropriate concentration at 80°C, respectively. The impregnated silica particles were evaporated to dryness, and then dried overnight at 100°C. Finally, the resultant was calcined in air for 8h at 850°C. 2.1.2 W–Mn/SiO2 (B): the mixture slurry method The aqueous solutions of Mn(NO3)2 and Na2WO4·2H2O in appropriate concentration were added dropwise into a stirred silica sol at room temperature, respectively. The resultant were mixed well in the rotatory evaporator at 80°C for 5h to be homogeneous. The mixture slurry was then dried overnight at 100°C, followed by calcined in air for 8h at 850°C. The catalyst sample was crushed and sieved to a size of 40–60 mesh. 2.1.3 W–Mn/SiO2 (C): the sol–gel method The Mn(NO3)2 and Na2WO4·2H2O were added to a vessel containing a certain amount (C2H5)4SiO4 at a desired ratio, which was stirred vigorously for 30min before the addition of appropriate amounts of ethanol and HNO3, and with vigorously stirring to complete the gelation at 60°C. The dryness and calcination of the gel were in the same way of other two methods above. After calcination, the catalyst sample was then crushed and sieved to a size of 40–60 mesh. 2.2 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction patterns of fresh catalysts were obtained with a Panalytical X’pert Pro. diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at room temperature. Diffractograms were recorded from 2θ =10–80° with the detector moving in Δ2θ =0.017° steps to achieve good angular resolution. The specific surface areas of the catalysts were measured by BET method on an ASAP 2010 apparatus at liquid nitrogen temperature with N2 as the absorbate. XPS analyses of the catalysts were performed on a VG ESCALAB 210 spectrometer. The fresh catalyst was placed on sample holder pressed into a self-supported wafer. A Mg target was used as the anode of the X-ray source with a power of 200W. The pass energy of the analyzer was 30eV in a step increment of 0.05eV. The binding energies were calibrated using the Si(2p) line at 103.4eV as the reference. Near-surface compositions were calculated from peak areas using the sensitivity factors, which were provided in the software of the instrument. Temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD) was carried out on an AMI-100 catalytic microreactor, and the products were detected with an on-line Dycor system 1000 quadrupole mass spectrometer. The heating rate was 30°C/min and the temperature range was from room temperature to 1000°C. Before performing an O2-TPD experiment, the sample (0.1g) was pretreated in a helium stream at 950°C for 20min to remove adsorbates, followed by cooling to room temperature in O2 and then purging with helium for 20min. The quantification of O2 desorbed from the catalysts was calibrated by the peak areas against a standard pulse of O2. 2.3 Catalytic activity test Activity testing was carried out in a quartz fixed-bed microreactor (i.d. 8mm) at ambient atmospheric pressure. 0.2g catalyst (40–60 mesh) was loaded in the reactor and the length of the catalyst bed was approximately 10mm. Quartz chips was filled in the remaining space of reactor so as to reduce the contribution from gas-phase reactions. The reactants, CH4 (99.9%) and O2 (99.9%) without any diluents, were co-fed into the reactor. At the reactor outlet a cold trap was used to remove water from the exit gas stream. Blank runs with quartz chips showed negligible conversion at the reaction conditions. The reaction products were then analyzed with an on-line gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD, using a Poropak Q column for the separation of CH4, CO2, C2H4, and C2H6, and a 5A molecular sieve column for the separation of O2, CH4, and CO. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalysts characterization analysis In order to obtain information about the principle components of these catalysts, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was used to identify bulk phases composition and crystal size in different catalysts. The XRD patterns of W–Mn/SiO2 (A)–(C) are shown in Fig. 1 . It can be seen that the main crystallite phases of catalysts were Mn2O3, Na2WO4 and α-cristobalite. Although the precursors of silica support in these catalysts were different for one another, most of them were transformed into highly crystallite α-cristobalite during calcination except that a little of quartz were detected in W–Mn/SiO2 (B). Table 1 shows that the crystal size of Mn2O3 and Na2WO4 in W–Mn/SiO2 (A)–(C) catalysts were in the range of 61.4–82.1 and 50.7–53.5nm, respectively. Table 2 shows the observed binding energy and near-surface elemental concentrations of the fresh catalysts by XPS characterization. As the stoichiometric calculation, the 5wt% Na2WO4–2wt% Mn/SiO2 had an average bulk atomic composition of 0.7% Na, 0.35% W, 0.75% Mn and 32.2% Si. By comparison with the bulk compositions, for the W–Mn/SiO2 (A) catalysts prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method, surface atomic concentration of Na, W and Mn were 10.0%, 0.5% and 4.6%, respectively, which indicated that Na, W and Mn were enriched on catalyst surface. For the W–Mn/SiO2 (B) sample, the surface atomic concentration of W and Mn were nearly identical with the bulk composition, while for W–Mn/SiO2 (C) sample, the W and Mn somewhat migrated to the catalyst surface. On the other hand, it could be seen that the binding energy of Na(1s), W(4f), Mn(2p), Si(2p) and O(1s) did not change with the different catalyst preparations. The oxygen species with O(1s) binding energy of 532.0 was assigned to surface SiO2, and the oxygen species with O(1s) binding energy of 530.0 was assigned to surface MO x . The O2-TPD profiles of fresh catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . For W–Mn/SiO2 (A), W–Mn/SiO2 (B) and W–Mn/SiO2 (C), there was only one O2 desorption peak centered, respectively, at ca 935, 920, and 945°C; the corresponding amounts were 37.6, 30.6, and 59.0μmolg−1. Many of references [1,3,4,15–17] reported that the active oxygen species of Na–W–Mn/SiO2 catalysts were surface lattice oxygen, which desorption began at ca 620°C and mass-produced at ca 820°C. In Fig. 5, one can observed that desorption of O2 began at ca 600°C for three of W–Mn/SiO2 samples. Before 800°C no desorption peak was observed for all samples, indicating no physical and chemical adsorptions of O2 on W–Mn/SiO2 catalysts. Because there was one only O2 desorption peak for each of three samples at higher than 900°C, the desorbed oxygen should include not only surface lattice oxygen, but also bulk lattice oxygen. 3.2 Oxidative coupling of methane The results of reactant conversions and product selectivities of 5wt% Na2WO4–2wt% Mn/SiO2 catalysts prepared by different methods for OCM are listed in Table 3 . The C2 selectivities of W–Mn/SiO2 (A), W–Mn/SiO2 (B) and W–Mn/SiO2 (C) were comparable under the same reaction conditions, while CH4 conversion and O2 conversion of W–Mn/SiO2 (C) catalyst were evident lower than those of other two catalysts. In addition, over the W–Mn/SiO2 (C) catalyst, a higher CO2 selectivity and lower C2H4 and CO selectivities were observed. Fig. 3 shows the influence of temperature for OCM reaction over the W–Mn/SiO2 catalysts. It should be noted that, the OCM reaction, and more so far the deep oxidation reactions, is very exothermic. The reactor temperature will increase with the accumulation of reaction heat and hot spots will be present in the catalyst bed [11,18–20]. In the present experiments, the increase of temperature in catalyst bed was indeed observed at the beginning of the reaction, but after steady state was reached the temperature of catalyst was 20°C higher in average than the operation temperature. To be consistent with our previous reports, all the temperature present here referred to the operation temperature. With the increase of temperature from 800 to 820°C, the conversion of methane and oxygen simultaneously dramatically increased over W–Mn/SiO2 (A) and W–Mn/SiO2 (B) catalysts. For W–Mn/SiO2 (C) catalyst, CH4 and O2 conversion increased constantly with the temperature increasing in the range of 780–860°C, and no leaping increase of those like other two catalysts was observed. The best selectivity of C2 was occurred at 800°C for both W–Mn/SiO2 (A) and W–Mn/SiO2 (B) catalysts, and at 820°C for W–Mn/SiO2 (C) catalyst. It was expected, when oxygen consumption was close to 100%, that there would be a drop in deep oxidation and an increase in C2 selectivity. However, for Na2WO4–Mn/SiO2 catalysts, a decrease of C2 selectivity was observed with the temperature increase at the nearly 100% oxygen conversion condition. It suggested that the self of gas oxygen did not participate directly in OCM reaction over Na2WO4–Mn/SiO2 catalysts. Our previous studies [10,17] have been clarified that the active oxygen species was surface lattice oxygen Os 2− for Na2WO4–Mn/SiO2 catalyst, and transport of gas-phase oxygen molecules to lattice oxygen ions over surface catalytic sites is the key step toward the formation of active oxygen species. Compared catalytic performances with the results of O2-TPD, W–Mn/SiO2 (C) catalyst was modest in the capability to activate gas oxygen, which in turn debased the conversion of methane. Because of more desorbed oxygen, W–Mn/SiO2 (C) catalyst was not so good as an oxygen-catcher. With the increase of temperatures from 820°C or 840°C, C2 selectivities decreasing and CO selectivities increasing due to the bulk lattice oxygen more likely began to release, which facilitated the deep oxidation process of hydrocarbon. These observations were in agreement with the report in reference [2] that CO was mainly produced by the deep oxidation of C2 hydrocarbon in OCM reaction. 3.3 Catalyst stability Based on the data of catalytic performance, one can observe that there were comparable catalytic activities for OCM reaction over 5wt% Na2WO4–2wt% Mn/SiO2 catalysts prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method and mixture slurry method. In addition, the results of XPS indicated, for the catalysts prepared by mixture slurry method and sol–gel method, that the elemental concentrations on surface and in bulk of catalysts were relatively uniform, which was expected to alleviate the loss of active components in long-term reaction. Considering the stability test of Na2WO4–Mn/SiO2 catalysts prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method have been carried out in our previous works [17,21], only the stability of 5wt% Na2WO4–2wt% Mn/SiO2 catalysts prepared by mixture slurry method was investigated in this study. Fig. 4 shows that W–Mn/SiO2 (B) catalyst was stable throughout a 500h run at 800°C, 3.0×104 mlg−1 h−1 GHSV and CH4/O2 =2. CH4 conversion maintained at 27–31%, C2 selectivity was 68–71% and C2H4 selectivity was 40–46%. With the time on stream, CO selectivity increased from 10% to 20% and CO2 selectivity decreased from 20% to 10% approximately. Structure changes in the catalyst used for 500h reaction were characterized using XRD and XPS methods. In Fig. 5 the XRD patterns show that the crystal state of support SiO2 changed from α-cristobalite into α-tridymite and SiO2 quartz; Na, W and Mn could still be detected as the crystallite phases of Na2WO4 and Mn2O3. Literatures [5,12] reported that the phase transition from amorphous silica to α-cristobalite was a crucially important requirement to generated active and highly selective catalysts, especially with respect to formation of ethylene. However, in our study, the change from α-cristobalite into α-tridymite and SiO2 quartz did not significantly influence the activity and selectivity of catalyst. This result suggested that the α-cristobalite in Na2WO4–Mn/SiO2 catalyst can provided high activity and selectivity, but it is not always indispensable. The surface areas of the fresh and used catalysts are given in Table 4 , from which it is evident that reaction after 500h decreased the surface areas from 3.0 to 1.2m2 g−1. This attributed to the phase transition of α-cristobalite. XPS results obtained on the fresh W–Mn/SiO2 (B) catalyst and after 500h on stream are shown in Table 4. There was an increase in Na, W and Mn concentrations on catalyst surface after an extended time on stream. The fact that these elements concentrations increased with the time on stream was consistent with the sustained activity and selectivity of this catalyst. However, studies on the 450h catalyst prepared by he incipient wetness impregnation method revealed that 97% of the tungsten species observed on the fresh catalyst by XPS disappeared [17]. In comparison with the catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method, it was the uniform elemental concentrations between surface and bulk of W–Mn/SiO2 (B) catalyst that made elements migrate from bulk to surface and counteracted the loss of active components during the reaction. What the elements migrated from bulk to surface could be explained as follows: firstly, with time on stream, under OCM reaction conditions, Na, W and Mn doped in the bulk of W–Mn/SiO2 (B) catalyst inclined to move towards the surface of catalyst accompanying with the crystal perfection of SiO2; secondly, the relatively poor oxygen atmosphere induced the metals to shift from the bulk to the surface of catalyst. Hence, the Na2WO4–Mn/SiO2 catalyst prepared by the mixture slurry method exhibited excellent stability. 4 Conclusion The incipient wetness impregnation method was most extensively applied to prepare W–Mn/SiO2 catalysts as tradition, and provided excellent catalytic activity for OCM reaction. By controlling the preparation conditions, the 5wt% Na2WO4–2wt% Mn/SiO2 catalysts prepared by the mixture slurry method could obtain similar activity comparing with the incipient wetness impregnation method. The catalyst prepared by sol–gel method exhibited a modest capability to activate oxygen and methane. For all samples prepared by different methods, the main crystallite phases were Mn2O3, Na2WO4 and α-cristobalite, and the different precursors of silica were transformed ultimately into highly crystallite α-cristobalite. For the catalyst prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method, Na, W and Mn were mainly distributed on the surface of catalyst. While those catalysts prepared by latter methods, the elements distribution were more uniform between the surface and bulk. 500h stability test showed that the mixture slurry method could alleviate the loss of active components and provided an excellent stability. Although the α-cristobalite was considered as an important requirement for the production of effective catalyst, the structure change of support SiO2 after 500h run indicated that it was not always indispensable for high active and selective.
