We present a machine learning-driven framework for the discovery and optimization of catalysts in gas adsorption mechanism, focusing on layered heterogeneous catalysts. This approach integrates electronic-structure descriptors with predictive and generative models to explore and evaluate catalyst compositions. By analyzing the adsorption energies of C, O, N, and H, we identify key electronic features that influence chemisorption and govern catalytic performance. Feature attribution methods and permutation importance analyses provide both local and global insights into feature significance, pinpointing critical descriptors that drive material behavior. The generative workflow uncovers novel catalyst candidates and outliers. These outliers — materials situated in low-density regions of the electronic feature space — were analyzed using statistical methods, principal component analysis (PCA), and feature importance techniques to uncover their unique electronic signatures and the potential influence of d-band width and d-band upper edge on catalytic behavior. This strategy accelerates the identification of high-performing catalytic materials, offering a scalable, data-driven pathway for innovation in catalysis and energy storage applications, while ensuring that the discovered materials meet specified adsorption energy ranges for targeted reactions.

In these applications, the design of highly active and durable electrocatalysts is critical for enabling reversible reactions and enhancing overall performance. Although electrocatalytic principles are not central to all battery types, their role becomes particularly important in batteries involving gas-phase reactants or redox-active interfaces. Traditionally, the development of such electrocatalysts has relied on extensive trial-and-error experimentation, often limited by reproducibility and narrow material exploration [4,5]. To overcome these challenges, theoretical calculations and simulations have emerged as powerful tools to accelerate catalyst development by identifying activity descriptors that correlate structure with catalytic performance [6,7]. While the traditional methods have been instrumental in understanding catalytic activity, they often operate within a narrow material space, typically limited to well-studied elements and binary compounds [8]. This constrained exploration makes it difficult to identify unconventional materials with superior catalytic properties, and to consider broader factors that influence catalyst design [9]. One key avenue for addressing these broader factors is the exploration of heterogenous catalysts, including bimetallic and multimetallic materials [10]. Heterogenous catalysts, including bimetallic and multimetallic materials, present distinct advantages in catalysis by leveraging the synergistic interactions between different metallic elements [11]. These interactions create surface sites with superior physicochemical properties, enabling high performance in various chemical and electrochemical reactions [12]. However, identifying optimal alloy compositions to improve key electrochemical properties such as reaction overpotentials, charge-transfer kinetics, and stability under cycling conditions remains both costly and time-consuming [13]. The band theory of chemisorption has been instrumental in alloy design, linking the electronic characteristics of active sites to the adsorption energies of key reaction intermediates [14]. Nevertheless, its reliance on the tight-binding approximation has limited its applicability to alloys with only minor modifications to host metals [15]. This highlights the need for advancements that expand the capability to explore and design heterogeneous catalysts with more complex and diverse compositions to enhance metal-air battery performance [16,17]. While traditional band theory has guided early alloy design, its limitations in capturing the full complexity of heterogeneous catalysts have prompted deeper investigations into the electronic origins of chemisorption behavior [18–20]. Identifying reliable descriptors of adsorption energy is a long-standing pursuit in surface science [21]. The d-band center theory, which postulates that the position of the metal d-band relative to the Fermi level governs adsorption strength, has been foundational in catalytic design [22–26]. Yet, its applicability diminishes in systems involving alloys, strained lattices, and nanoclusters, where electronic structure deviates from idealized metallic behavior [27]. To overcome these limitations, additional descriptors, such as d-band width, charge transfer, and orbital hybridization, have been incorporated [20,28,29]. Modern machine learning approaches have capitalized on these extended feature sets to better capture complex trends in adsorption energy, moving beyond simple linear scaling relations [20,28]. These advancements complement and extend existing d-band-derived approaches, strengthening the link between electronic structure features and experimentally validated adsorption-energy trends in catalytic design. In heterogeneous catalysis, electronic-structure descriptors derived from the d-band states play a crucial role in connecting catalyst geometry to their chemisorption properties [30,31]. The d-band model, introduced by Nørskov and Hammer, establishes a relationship between the average energy of the d-electronic states at a catalyst surface (d-band center) and the strength of adsorbate binding [32]. A higher d-band center is associated with stronger adsorbate interactions, while a lower d-band center correlates with weaker binding [33]. Beyond the d-band center, additional descriptors, such as the d-band width and the position of the upper d-band edge relative to the Fermi level, enhance the predictive understanding of catalytic behavior [34]. These advanced descriptors capture subtle variations in the electronic structure, enabling a more detailed assessment of catalyst performance in metal-air batteries [35,36]. Integrating these descriptors into catalyst screening methodologies can systematically identify materials with optimal properties, advancing sustainable catalytic technologies [37]. Predictive models have transformed assessment of catalyst performance by addressing the complex, high-dimensional challenges of optimizing heterogeneous catalysts in metal-air batteries [38]. Traditional approaches often fit power-law rate expressions to extensive experimental datasets to model catalytic behavior [39]. While these methods offer valuable, interpretable insights for reactor design, they are resource-intensive and limit the scope of exploration [40,41]. In contrast, predictive modeling, driven by machine learning (ML), allows catalytic activity to be estimated prior to experimentation, significantly accelerating the advancements of air battery technologies [42]. ML models extract critical insights from kinetic and synthetic datasets, providing valuable predictions about catalyst performance [43]. However, inconsistencies and a lack of standardization in available catalytic data pose challenges to reverse catalyst design [44]. Addressing these issues through robust, standardized frameworks that incorporate predictive capabilities will streamline catalyst optimization and drive advancements in the field of electrocatalysis in batteries [45]. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have become pivotal in revolutionizing catalysis research by introducing innovative methods for descriptor optimization and predictive modeling [46]. ML techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs), excel at capturing complex, nonlinear relationships between the geometric and electronic structures of catalysts and their chemisorption properties [47,48]. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) extend these capabilities by synthesizing data to explore unexplored material spaces and model intricate adsorbate-substrate interactions [49]. However, as the complexity of catalytic systems grows, key questions arise: How can we efficiently navigate the vast landscape of possible material compositions for various catalytic processes in batteries? What hidden patterns or relationships can be uncovered to drive catalyst innovation? How can generative models contribute to discovering new catalyst materials? To address these challenges, tools like knowledge graphs and natural language processing (NLP) extract valuable insights from scientific literature, enabling a deeper understanding of the relationships between catalytic properties [50]. These AI-driven approaches not only enhance the ability to predict catalytic performance but also reveal fundamental insights that support reverse catalyst design for the electrochemical applications [51]. Several studies have demonstrated how integrating ML with high-throughput experimentation frameworks can automate catalyst screening, optimize reaction conditions, and even extrapolate beyond known chemical spaces [52,53]. For instance, a classification of AI applications in catalysis illustrated how supervised and unsupervised algorithms can enhance each stage of the catalyst development [54]. Earlier efforts have also focused on building predictive models using artificial neural networks and decision trees to analyze catalyst properties based on synthesis and structural features [53,55]. In a comparative study, artificial neural network models incorporating dimensionality-reduced XRD data achieved prediction accuracies up to 94 %, while decision trees reached full classification performance, underscoring the potential of ML to exploit structural information for catalyst evaluation [56]. Complementary approaches leveraging ensemble models, such as random forests, have further enabled interpretability and feature attribution, aiding in the design of transition metal phosphides and other electrocatalysts with enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction activity [57]. In parallel, AI workflows integrating natural language processing, Bayesian optimization, and active learning have been proposed to leverage literature knowledge for catalyst synthesis and scale-up, including applications in ammonia production [52,58,59]. These developments highlight the growing versatility of ML tools not only in predicting activity from first-principles or empirical data but also in guiding experimental campaigns and hypothesis generation [60,61]. The present study builds upon these efforts to predict and characterize the chemisorption properties of catalysts, focusing on the adsorption energies of key species in electrochemical catalysis such as C, O, N, and H. Machine learning models are employed to establish accurate links between electronic and geometric features and catalytic activity, enabling precise property predictions. Generative AI techniques identify, classify, and optimize potential catalysts by analyzing electronic structures and uncovering trends in chemisorption behavior. To refine these predictions, outliers in the generated datasets are examined using statistical feature importance methods, including Random Forest (RF) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis, to identify critical electronic descriptors. By embedding these findings into a generative AI framework, we systematically identify and categorize promising catalysts for electrochemical applications. This approach facilitates targeted optimization of chemisorption properties and advances the fundamental understanding of catalytic design for a wide range of electrochemical processes. 2 Experimental methods 2.1 Data description This study involves compiling a comprehensive dataset focused on heterogeneous catalysts. The dataset consists of 235 unique heterogeneous catalysts [62]. For each alloy, the adsorption energies of carbon (C), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), and hydrogen (H) are recorded. Additionally, detailed d-band characteristics are included, such as the d-band center, d-band filling, d-band width, and the d-band upper edge. All d-band descriptors values are relative to the Fermi level. These parameters are critical in understanding the electronic properties of the catalysts and their reactivity. The chemisorption model is computed using Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional [63,64]. All calculations were performed in Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) using a 450 eV plane-wave cutoff and a 4 × 4 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid [65–69]. The layered-alloy slab model used in this study consists of five atomic layers [62]. The topmost (surface) layer and the bottom three layers are composed entirely of the base metal. The second layer, located just beneath the surface, is substituted with a different ligand metal. The bottom three layers are fixed at the bulk lattice constant of the base metal and uniformly strained. Surface metals include Rhodium (Rh), Palladium (Pd), Iridium (Ir), and Platinum (Pt), while the ligand metals span a broader range: Iron (Fe), Cobalt (Co), Nickel (Ni), Copper (Cu), Molybdenum (Mo), Ruthenium (Ru), Rhodium (Rh), Palladium (Pd), Silver (Ag), Tungsten (W), Rhenium (Re), Osmium (Os), Iridium (Ir), Platinum (Pt), and Gold (Au). Adsorbates were placed on high-symmetry sites depending on the surface metal, and the d-band descriptors calculated relative to the Fermi level from the projected density of state [62]. To ensure consistency and enhance the robustness of the analysis, all data were preprocessed to standardize formats and scales. The features were standardized using zero-mean, unit-variance scaling prior to performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to ensure comparability and eliminate bias due to differing feature magnitudes. This preprocessing step provided a uniform foundation for subsequent computational modeling. 2.2 Predictive modeling and data generation for materials This study integrates predictive and generative modeling to analyze material properties. A hybrid model architecture was employed, comprising a regression model and a Generative Adversarial Network. The regression model predicts material properties based on electronic and geometric features. The feed-forward network consists of two hidden layers with ReLU activation, which allows it to capture nonlinear relationships between input features and output properties [70]. The final layer produces continuous variable predictions, trained using Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss with the Adam optimizer ensuring efficient convergence [71]. Complementing the regression model, a GAN generates synthetic data to explore new material compositions. The GAN consists of a generator that transforms random vectors into realistic feature vectors, and a discriminator that distinguishes between real and generated data. The networks are trained in an adversarial manner using Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss [71]. The generator refines its ability to mimic the dataset, while the discriminator improves its capacity to differentiate synthetic data from real examples. 2.3 Feature importance via permutation importance Permutation importance was used to quantify the global significance of each feature by measuring how the performance of the model changes when the values of a feature are randomly shuffled [72]. A substantial performance drop indicates that the feature is critical to the predictive capabilities. This method provides a ranking of features based on their overall importance, offering a global perspective on how features contribute to the model's success. 2.4 Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis SHAP values were employed to analyze the influence of individual features on specific model predictions. This model-agnostic method assigns a contribution score to each feature for a given instance, indicating how much a feature has shifted the prediction compared to a baseline [73]. Positive SHAP values signify that a feature increased the prediction, while negative values indicate a decreasing effect [74]. SHAP summary plots visualize the global importance of features by showing their impact across multiple data points, revealing feature interactions and their influence on the behavior of the model. 2.5 Connection between SHAP and permutation importance SHAP and permutation importance were both applied to assess feature importance, but they offer different perspectives. SHAP focuses on local explanations, detailing the contribution of individual features to specific predictions and providing instance-level insights into the predictive model [74]. In contrast, permutation importance evaluates the global significance of features by analyzing their effect on overall model performance when their relationship with the target variable is disrupted. Therefore, these methods provide complementary insights. Permutation importance offers a broad, global view of how features influence the overall performance of the model, while SHAP provides instance-specific explanations of feature impacts. 2.6 Latent space exploration and material generation with GANs Outliers generated by the Generative Adversarial Network are created by exploring the latent space boundaries, producing feature vectors different from typical data distributions. To clarify, the term “outlier” in our work refers specifically to materials that appear in low-density regions of the PCA-projected feature space constructed using the standardized d-band electronic descriptors. These materials were not defined as outliers based on any external property or application but solely based on their location in the descriptor space resulting from principal component analysis. Figure S1 illustrates the workflow for material generation and validation using GANs, detailing the steps of latent space exploration, descriptor generation, validation, and statistical analysis of outliers. Figure S2 shows that the process begins with the generation of random noise vectors, which are scaled using a boundary factor to explore a wider latent space [75]. These vectors are passed through a trained GAN generator to produce latent feature representations, which are then mapped to material candidates and evaluated by a property predictor. Bayesian optimization is applied to iteratively refine the latent vectors toward materials that meet predefined adsorption energy targets. These adjusted noise vectors are passed through the trained generator, producing feature sets that exhibit extreme or unusual characteristics relative to the normal data distribution. The generated feature configurations are then converted into material descriptors following a predefined format, \"element_strain@element.\" The features are mapped to valid chemical elements from a predefined list, with numerical values assigned from an allowed set. To ensure these descriptors conform to domain-specific rules, a validation step filters out invalid configurations. The valid descriptors are compared against existing dataset to assess the generated heterogeneous catalysts or metal alloys. Matches and mismatches are identified to evaluate whether the generated materials present in the original dataset or represent new combinations. Statistical analyses, such as descriptive statistics and PCA, are conducted to characterize the outliers properties and visualize their position relative to the dataset [76]. Hypothesis testing, like t-tests, is used to detect significant differences between the outliers and typical data [77]. Additionally, feature importance analysis using RF regression identifies the key features distinguishing outliers, revealing the unique attributes that define these materials [78]. 2.7 Optimized catalyst discovery using Bayesian optimization and GANs Optimized catalyst discovery combines the generative power of GANs with the efficiency of Bayesian optimization to identify latent vectors that yield catalyst configurations with desirable properties [79]. This method explores the latent space to generate catalysts tailored to meet predefined objectives, such as specified adsorption energy ranges for each atom. Bayesian optimization drives the search for optimal latent vectors [80]. The optimization algorithm evaluates latent vectors by generating corresponding catalysts and assessing their properties against an objective function [81]. This approach leverages the exploratory capability of GANs to generate diverse configurations and directs the search toward specific goals through Bayesian optimization. It enables the discovery of catalysts with targeted properties, significantly advancing material discovery and optimization. 3 Results and discussion Analyzing data through PCA provides a robust framework for uncovering the underlying structure and dominant patterns in the dataset. The PCA results offer critical insights into the electronic structure features, including d-band center, d-band filling, d-band width, and d-band upper edge, which are key descriptors for understanding material properties. The analysis is summarized in four visualizations of Fig. 1a-d. The bar plot of Fig. 1a illustrates the percentage of variance explained by each principal component (PC). The first two PCs collectively explain approximately 90 % of the variance, with PC1 alone contributing nearly 60 %. This indicates that most of the variability is captured by the first two PCs, making them highly informative for dimensionality reduction and feature interpretation. The scree plot of Fig. 1b provides a view of the variance explained by each PC. The sharp decline in variance after the first two PCs reaffirms their dominance in capturing the variability. The flattening of the curve beyond PC2 suggests diminishing returns in including additional components. The cumulative variance plot of Fig. 1c demonstrates that the first two PCs capture over 90 % of the variance, reinforcing their importance for data representation. PCA Loadings Heatmap (Fig. 1d) reveals the contributions of the original features to each PC. PC1 is dominated by d-band filling and d-band upper edge, indicating their significant roles in explaining the primary variance. PC2, in contrast, is heavily influenced by d-band center and d-band filling, reflecting a shift in the dominant features as the focus moves to secondary variance. These loadings highlight the interplay between different features and their relative importance in defining the dataset's structure. The PCA results underscore the central role of electronic structure properties in shaping the variance. The dominance of d-band filling and d-band upper edge in PC1, followed by d-band center in PC2, aligns with their established significance in influencing adsorption energies and other material properties. The scatter plot (Figure S4) illustrates the PCA projection of the dataset, with blue dots representing the entire dataset and red triangles indicating the detected outliers. Most of the data points are clustered closely along the PCA1 and PCA2 axes, while the outliers are distinctly separated. This separation underscores the effectiveness of PCA in distinguishing anomalous material configurations. We first assessed the accuracy of the trained model. The model demonstrated high predictive performance on the test set, with R2 values reaching up to 98.2 % and root mean squared errors as low as 0.05 eV for the property predictions. These confirm the reliability of the model and provide a foundation for subsequent feature attribution and generative analyses. The feature importance analysis for the four targets ( Fig. 2a-d) reveals distinct contributions of electronic structure features in predicting adsorption energies. For the adsorption energy of carbon (Fig. 2a), d-band filling emerges as the most dominant feature, but d-band upper edge also plays a notable role. This indicates that carbon adsorption is influenced not only by electron occupancy within the d-band but also by the energy levels at the upper edge of the d-band. The combination of these two factors suggests a slightly more complex interaction between carbon adsorbates and the catalyst surface compared to other elements. However, d-band filling remains the primary driver, making predictive modeling relatively straightforward, with additional refinements possible by considering the d-band upper edge. For the adsorption energies of nitrogen and oxygen (Fig. 2b-c), d-band filling is the overwhelmingly dominant feature, with d-band upper edge contributing only minimally. The d-band width and d-band center have negligible influence in both cases. This suggests that nitrogen and oxygen adsorption behaviors are largely governed by a single key parameter (d-band filling) highlighting the simplicity of their interactions with the catalyst surface. The minimal contributions from other features imply that straightforward predictive models focused on d-band filling are sufficient for optimizing materials for nitrogen and oxygen adsorption. In contrast, for the adsorption energy of hydrogen (Fig. 2d), the d-band center becomes the most critical feature, with d-band upper edge also playing a significant role. d-band filling and d-band width contribute minimally to hydrogen adsorption. This shift indicates that hydrogen adsorption is more sensitive to the specific energy levels of electronic states, particularly the position of the d-band center relative to the Fermi level. The dependency on these energy-specific features suggests that hydrogen adsorption behavior requires a more detailed understanding of electronic structure compared to carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, reflecting a more complex relationship that demands a comprehensive modeling approach. Across all targets (Fig. 2a-d), the sharp decline in importance beyond the top-ranked features reinforces the sparsity in the predictive power of the models, indicating that a small subset of features is sufficient to capture most of the variance in adsorption behavior. These findings have practical implications for material optimization and design. Fig. 3a-d presents a comparative SHAP analysis across the four adsorption targets (C, O, N, and H), revealing both shared and distinct behaviors among the four electronic descriptors. The SHAP summary plots reveal distinct patterns in how each d-band electronic descriptor influences the predicted adsorption energies. The d-band center exhibits a strong, monotonic effect across all adsorbates (C, O, N, and H), with higher values (less negative) consistently associated with positive SHAP values, while lower values (more negative) shift SHAP values negatively. This directional relationship is clearly reflected in the well-separated red and blue coloring along the SHAP axis. Similarly, the d-band filling displays a structured and smooth color gradient, particularly for oxygen and nitrogen, where higher filling values (red) increase the predicted energy and lower values (blue) decrease it. Despite its narrow range, the consistent SHAP patterns highlight its significant influence. In contrast, the d-band width shows a more scattered distribution of SHAP values with no clear color separation, indicating a weak or non-monotonic effect for most adsorbates, apart from hydrogen, where some directional behavior becomes evident. The d-band upper edge presents a moderate and context-dependent influence, with partial color separation and wider SHAP spreads notably in the case of hydrogen, suggesting a more nuanced role depending on the adsorbate. Overall, these results highlight the complex, adsorbate-specific roles of electronic structure descriptors. Although d-band center and filling emerge as broadly influential, d-band width exhibits high target-dependence, and d-band upper edge plays only a minor role. While SHAP values provide useful insights into the contribution of each feature to the predictions, it is important to note that our SHAP analysis does not explicitly account for correlations among descriptors. Since features such as d-band center, width, and upper edge are physically and statistically correlated, the individual SHAP attributions should be interpreted with caution. To address this, a correlation matrix of the d-band descriptors was constructed (Figure S3) to clarify the degree of interdependence among the features. While some degree of correlation exists among the features, the descriptors remain sufficiently distinct to support their individual use in adsorption energy prediction. Box plots in Fig. 4a-d provide additional insights by comparing feature distributions between outliers and the entire dataset. The boxplots reveal that d-band width and d-band upper edge are the primary contributors to outlier formation in the dataset, while d-band center and d-band filling show stable distributions without any outliers. For d-band center (Fig. 4a), the values are within the expected range, with no data points falling outside the whiskers. This indicates that variations in the average energy position of the d-states relative to the Fermi level do not lead to significant deviations in material behavior. Similarly, d-band filling (Fig. 4b), which reflects the electron occupancy within the d-band, also shows no outliers. This suggests that electron filling remains consistent across both typical materials and those identified as outliers, indicating a uniform influence on adsorption properties. In contrast, d-band width and d-band upper edge (Fig. 4c-d) displays clear outliers outside of the whiskers. The materials with unusually wide d-band widths, corresponding to more delocalized electronic states, exhibit unexpected adsorption behaviors. Additionally, the increased delocalization can weaken localized interactions with adsorbates, leading to deviations from typical adsorption trends. This variability makes the d-band upper edge a critical factor in generating outlier behaviors, particularly in systems sensitive to high-energy electronic interactions. Therefore, d-band width and d-band upper edge create outliers due to their influence on the spread and availability of electronic states, which can destabilize or enhance adsorption in unexpected ways. On the other hand, the consistent behavior of d-band center and d-band filling suggests that these features contribute to adsorption in a more predictable manner, without leading to significant anomalies in material performance. Our results highlight the limitations of relying solely on the d-band center as a universal descriptor of adsorption strength. While the d-band center has historically served as a first-order approximation for simple systems [22,27], we observe that its predictive power is notably reduced in alloyed surfaces. In our models, the d-band center was often not among the most influential features, and additional d-band-related descriptors offered a more comprehensive representation of adsorption behavior across diverse systems. This divergence is even more pronounced for outlier systems, where the most influential features are not directly related to average band positions but include other characteristics such as edge position, asymmetry, and hybridization behavior [62,82,83]. This outcome aligns with recent studies that advocate for expanded, high-dimensional descriptor spaces to enable generalizable and interpretable catalyst discovery pipelines [24,28,82,83]. Building on these insights into feature importance and outliers, the focus now shifts to the generated materials. The generated materials are categorized into four groups: matched (present in the original dataset) materials, unmatched materials (absent from the original dataset), matched outliers, and unmatched outliers ( Table 1). These classifications provide valuable insights into the relationships between elemental features and their combinations, highlighting both conventional and unconventional material configurations. Outliers in this study were defined as materials located in low-density regions of the descriptor space, as identified through PCA projection (Figure S4) and supported by boxplot distributions (Fig. 4c-d). They were categorized based on whether they matched known materials in the dataset or represented novel, previously unseen compositions. These materials were subjected to statistical tests and feature importance analyses to identify which descriptors contributed most to their outlier status. Compositional outliers may involve uncommon combinations of primary and secondary elements or strain effects that are not present in the original data, suggesting potential material structures. On the other hand, electronic property outliers might exhibit distinct characteristics such as atypical d-band features (center, width, filling, or upper edge) or exceptional adsorption energies for elements like O, H, N, and C. Identifying such outliers is crucial, as they may represent materials with unexplored functionalities. The combination of high d-band width and elevated d-band upper edge was especially associated with outlier behavior. This refined understanding of outlier characteristics aids in prioritizing candidates for experimental validation and identifying materials with novel catalytic behavior. In future work, incorporating additional descriptors and applying generative models to target these low-density regions could further enhance the discovery of unconventional catalysts. Generated materials present in the original dataset, such as Rh@Ru, Pd@Rh, Pd@Ru, Pd@Os, Ir@Rh, Ir@Os, Pd@Fe, Pt@W, Pd@Co, and Rh@Fe, highlight the strategic inclusion of noble and transition metals, known for their exceptional catalytic properties and stability in extreme environments [84–88]. Generated materials absent from the original dataset, including Fe@Rh, Co@Rh, Ni@Rh, Cu@R, Rh@Mo, Fe@Ru, Fe@Mo, Co@Ru, Ru@Rh, and Ni@Ru, extend the scope of material exploration beyond the used dataset. Their appearance underscores the capacity of the model to interpolate and extrapolate chemically reasonable materials that are absent in the dataset. Top-ranked generated candidates that lie in statistically distinct regions of the PCA-projected feature space include Pd@Au, Pd@Cu, Ag@Pt, Ag@Cu, Ag@Pd, Pd@Ni, Cu@Au, Ag@Au, Au@Ag, and Au@Ni. Their separation from the bulk of the training data is reflected in descriptor shifts, particularly for d-band width and upper edge, as shown in Fig. 4. Additional materials that are not present in the dataset but identified as distinct in the feature space include Mo@Sn, Bi@Mn, Mo@Ti, Y@Cr, Y@Bi, V@La, Ta@Co, Sn@Y, Mn@Re, and Ta@Cr. These candidates illustrate the generative model's reach into less conventional chemical spaces, suggesting potential for novel alloy combinations. This framework highlights both the recurring significance of transition and noble metals and the prospective nature of combinations involving uncommon elements. Transition metals like nickel, copper, and cobalt consistently appear probably due to their structural, electronic, and catalytic properties [89–91]. Noble metals such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium remain central to catalytic systems, probably owing to their stability and ability to facilitate chemical reactions under extreme conditions [86,92]. By categorizing materials into these distinct groups, the analysis emphasizes both the continuity of established material science and the innovation of unexplored combinations. Transition metals provide structural and electronic stability, noble metals enhance catalytic efficiency, and less common elements contribute unique properties like mechanical strength or electronic functionality. Together, these insights offer a platform for targeted material exploration, optimizing configurations for energy storage, catalysis, and advanced functional materials. The analysis of feature importance and P-value rankings ( Table 2 and Figure S5) highlights the critical role of specific features in distinguishing outliers from the rest of the dataset. The RF feature importance analysis identifies d-band width as the most influential feature in determining outliers, followed by d-band upper edge, d-band filling, and d-band center. These features encapsulate essential aspects of the materials' electronic structure, providing insights into the factors driving the unique behavior of outliers. The bar plot in Figure S5 visually reinforces these findings by illustrating the feature importance rankings. The dominance of d-band width is particularly evident, underscoring its pivotal role in identifying outliers, especially those related to energy-related targets. Meanwhile, d-band upper edge and d-band filling also demonstrate significant contributions, indicating their relevance in complementing the predictions. To evaluate whether the distributions of features differed significantly between outliers and the rest of the dataset, we conducted independent t-tests. The resulting P-values were not intended to indicate feature importance, but rather to test for statistically significant differences in mean values between the groups. In parallel, feature importance scores were computed using a Random Forest model using d-band descriptors. These scores reflect how much each feature contributes to the prediction performance of the model. The P-value analysis ranks features based on the frequency of P-values occurring below 0.05. D-band width and d-band upper edge appear most frequently with low P-values, highlighting their critical role in distinguishing outliers. D-band filling also shows fewer occurrences of low P-values. Although d-band center ranks lower in the feature importance hierarchy, it still presents some occurrences of P-values, indicating its subtle contribution to differentiating outliers. These results collectively demonstrate the ability of the model to identify key features that distinguish outliers, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying properties that make certain materials deviate from the norm of dataset. This insight can be instrumental in exploring novel material configurations and identifying unique properties in electrochemistry applications. The study also employs advanced optimization techniques to actively generate new candidates with desirable characteristics. Optimization using Bayesian techniques and generative adversarial networks proved effective in discovering materials with target adsorption energy ranges. Bayesian optimization refined latent vectors to explore regions with favorable adsorption properties, while GANs generated novel material configurations by expanding the search space. Setting appropriate adsorption energy ranges is critical in catalyst design, as the adsorption should neither be too weak nor too strong [93]. Weak adsorption may result in poor catalytic activity, as reactants fail to adhere sufficiently to the catalyst surface [94]. On the other hand, strong adsorption can hinder the desorption of products or intermediates, effectively blocking active sites [94]. Therefore, defining optimal energy ranges ensures a balance where reactants are adequately adsorbed to facilitate reactions but can also desorb easily, maintaining continuous catalytic cycles. This balance is essential for achieving high catalytic efficiency and stability in various chemical processes. If the adsorption energy of carbon is set between −8.0 eV and −7.0 eV, oxygen between −6.0 eV and −5.0 eV, nitrogen between −6.0 eV and −5.0 eV, and hydrogen between −3.0 eV and −2.0 eV, the generator iteratively collaborates with the property predictor to identify materials that satisfy these criteria. The generator proposes candidate materials by producing latent vectors, which are then refined through Bayesian optimization. These vectors are transformed into material features, and the property predictor evaluates their adsorption energies. This iterative process continues until materials within the desired energy ranges are identified. Specifically, Bayesian optimization navigates the 10-dimensional latent space of the generator network. The acquisition function was implemented via a Gaussian process surrogate model, with a default expected improvement criterion. Each optimization trial was allowed up to 30 calls, and we initialized the search from a random latent vector uniformly sampled for each dimension. The optimization objective penalized deviations from predefined adsorption energy targets, with a sum of violations over carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen targets. On average, promising candidates satisfying most criteria were discovered within 20 iterations per trial. One such material identified is molybdenum-silver alloy, which showed predicted adsorption energies of −7.1 eV (C), −5.4 eV (O), −5.6 eV (N), and −2.2 eV (H). All values fall within our design targets, highlighting the effectiveness of the combined optimization approach. The literature has also reported different forms of this alloy as an effective electrocatalyst [95–98]. To provide additional information about this Mo@Ag alloy structure, which exhibits the adsorption energies described above, electronic properties closely associated with catalytic behavior were calculated using Density Functional Theory. These calculations employed Grid-based Projector-Augmented Wave interfaced with Atomic Simulation Environment, utilizing the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation, a plane-wave cutoff of 500 eV, and a Gamma-centered 4 × 4 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid. The structural model was a five-layer slab with the second subsurface layer substituted by Ag atoms to form the Mo@Ag alloy. Calculated electronic descriptors for Mo@Ag included a d-band center of approximately −2.102 eV, a d-band width of 3.379 eV, a d-band upper edge around 0.267 eV, and a d-band filling of 0.762. These d-band descriptors were then used as input to our trained property prediction model, which yielded predicted adsorption energy values that fall within the desired target range previously defined during the optimization process. This provides further support for the promise of this alloy composition, although it should be noted that strain effects were not explicitly considered and lattice constants were fixed at bulk values. As such, actual catalytic performance and experimental d-band characteristics may differ, and further validation through strain-optimized calculations or experiments is necessary.The adsorption energy ranges used in this study were selected as representative examples based on established volcano curve analyses and kinetic models [93,94]. These ranges are not assumed to be universally optimal but serve as test cases to evaluate the ability of the model to identify candidate materials within a targeted chemisorption window. Alternative energy intervals may be equally appropriate depending on the reaction environment, surface structure, and specific application. By exploring different adsorption energy thresholds, one can assess the robustness and generalizability of the model across various catalytic regimes. Therefore, the combined use of predictive modeling, GANs, and Bayesian optimization offers a robust platform for future advancements in heterogeneous catalysis and energy technologies, enabling the discovery of catalytic materials with specific properties. 4 Conclusion This study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning frameworks in accelerating catalyst discovery by integrating predictive modeling, generative adversarial networks, and Bayesian optimization. The results emphasize the pivotal role of electronic-structure descriptors, d-band descriptors, in determining adsorption energies and catalytic performance. Specifically, d-band filling was critical for adsorption energies of carbon (C), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N), while d-band center and d-band width were significant for hydrogen (H) adsorption. Statistical analyses, including SHAP values and permutation importance, provided insights into feature contributions. Notably, d-band width and d-band upper edge significantly contributed to outlier formation, as confirmed by their importance scores and P-values, both of which were visualized using box plots. The study identified materials within a specified energy range that displayed optimal adsorption characteristics, further validating the robustness of the model. This understanding was instrumental in refining the generative and optimization processes, guiding the model to explore underrepresented regions of the material space. Our goal was to build an interpretable and reproducible framework that can serve as a foundation for future improvements, and to ensure that researchers in catalysis and materials science, especially those less familiar with advanced machine learning, can adopt, modify, and extend the approach in their own studies.

        "dc:description": "We present a machine learning-driven framework for the discovery and optimization of catalysts in gas adsorption mechanism, focusing on layered heterogeneous catalysts. This approach integrates electronic-structure descriptors with predictive and generative models to explore and evaluate catalyst compositions. By analyzing the adsorption energies of C, O, N, and H, we identify key electronic features that influence chemisorption and govern catalytic performance. Feature attribution methods and permutation importance analyses provide both local and global insights into feature significance, pinpointing critical descriptors that drive material behavior. The generative workflow uncovers novel catalyst candidates and outliers. These outliers — materials situated in low-density regions of the electronic feature space — were analyzed using statistical methods, principal component analysis (PCA), and feature importance techniques to uncover their unique electronic signatures and the potential influence of d-band width and d-band upper edge on catalytic behavior. This strategy accelerates the identification of high-performing catalytic materials, offering a scalable, data-driven pathway for innovation in catalysis and energy storage applications, while ensuring that the discovered materials meet specified adsorption energy ranges for targeted reactions.",
