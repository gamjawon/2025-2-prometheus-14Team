B. DAKE and R. V. CHAUDHARI* Chemical Engineering Division, National Chemical Laboratory, Pune 411008 (India) (Received May 30, 1985;accepted October 16,1985) Summary The kinetics of carbonylation of n-propanol and n-butanol using homo- geneous Rh complex catalyst is reported here. The effects of RhCIa- 3H20, hydroiodic acid and alcohol concentrations, CO pressure and temperature on the overall carbonylation rate have been investigated. In n-propanol carbonylation, n-butyric acid and isobutyric acid were formed with n/iso ratio of 3.5:1. In n-butanol carbonylation, n- and iso-valeric acids were formed. The n/iso ratio in both cases was found to be independent of conversion levels and temperature. The carbonylation reactions were found to be first order with respect to RhC^'SHzO and hydroiodic acid concen- trations, zero order with CO and negative order with respect to alcohol concentrations in both cases. Rate equations have been proposed and activa- tion energies of 23.3 and 24.49 kcal mol~1 were observed for n-propanol and n-butanol carbonylatioris respectively. Finally, the specific rates and kinetic features of carbonylation of n-alcohols have been compared. Introduction Carbonylation of alcohols to carboxylic acids by homogeneous catalysis has gained considerable importance in recent years. The commercial viability of this route has been already established by success of the Monsanto process for acetic acid manufacture [1]. Higher carboxylic acids can also be pro- duced by a similar process via carbonylation of n-alcohols. It is well known that Co and Rh complexes catalyze these reactions, and extensive reports on the role of various catalyst promoters and solvents in methanol carbonylation have been published or patented [2 -10]. The kinetics of ethanol and isopropanoJ carbonylation has also been reported NCL Communication No. 3831. ' 'Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/86/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 120 recently [11 -14], however there is no published literature on n-propanol and n-butanol carbonylations. It was therefore the aim of this work to study product distribution, selectivity and kinetics of carbonylation of n-propanol and n-butanol using homogeneous Rh complex catalyst. The kinetics of carbonylation of the homologus series of n-alcohols has also been compared. Experimental Materials Solvent acetic acid was freshly distilled before use, while n-propanol and n-butanol of A.R. grade (supplied by M/s. BDH Laboratories) were used. Hydroiodic acid (aq. 57%) and RhCla-SH^O supplied by M/s. Fluka and M/s. Johnson-Mathey, respectively, were used. Carbon monoxide of a purity greater than 99.6% was used directly from a cylinder. Apparatus and procedure All the kinetic experiments were carried out in a 300 ml batch pressure reactor supplied by M/s. Parr Instrument Co. USA. The details of this reactor and the procedure followed are described in our earlier work [14]. The analysis of liquid reactants and products was carried out using a HP 5840-A gas chromatograph with a 2 m long glass column packed with Chromosorb impregnated with 1% H3PO>4. The other conditions of GC analysis were: carrier (N;) gas rate 20 ml min~1, column temperature 35 - 160 C (programmed), injection temperature 350 C and detector (FID) temperature 350 C. The products of both the reactions, n-propyi iodide, n-propyi acetate, n-butyric acid, isobutyric acid, n-butyl iodide, n-butyl acetate, n-valeric acid and isovaleric acid were identified and characterized by GC and GC-MS techniques. Results and discussion Product distribution and selectivity The product distribution in carbonylation of n-propanol and n-butanol was studied in a batch reactor at 200 C and a CO pressure of 35 atm. The results are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. In the case of n-propanol carbonylation, the reaction was found to proceed via the intermediates n-propyi iodide and n-propyi acetate, leading to n- and isobutyric acids, respectively. In acetic acid as a reaction medimum, n-propanol was found to be quantitative- ly converted to n-propyi acetate under reaction conditions. The material balance of all the liquid components was found to agree within 95%, while the amount of CO consumed corresponded to the total amount of car- boxylic acids formed. The concentration of n-propyi iodide was constant over the entire conversion range, while that of n-propyi acetate decreased progressively with time. 121 CMZ 0-16 0-20 CO CONSUMED mol Fig. 1.

At all conversion levels, the ratio of n- to iso butyric acid was found to be constant at 3.5:1. In most cases, n-butyric acid was predominantly formed and the selectivity of n- and isobutyric acids was independent of temperature and conversion levels (see Fig. 3). 122 85 > l= 80 <-) TEMPERATURES 463 K - 0 473 K -A 488 K - 75 0 Fig. 3 90 85 50 100 CONVERSION 7.

Selectivity of n-valeric acid as a function of conversion at different temperatures. From Fig. 2, it can be seen that the trend of products formed in n- butanol carbonylation was similar to that of n-propanol. In this case, three products n-, iso- and t-valeric acids are expected, however, t-valeric acid was not found under the conditions studied. Interestingly, the selectivity behaviour of n- and isovaleric acids was also identical (see Fig. 4) to that observed in n-propanol carbonylation. The formation of n- and isobutyric acids in carbonylation of isopro- panol was reported earlier [II], and has been explained on the basis of possible isomerization of isopropyi iodide to n-propyi iodide. This mech- anism also explains the formation of isobutyric acid in carbonylation of n- propanol. Similarly, the formation of isovaleric acid from n-butanol can be explained. 123 Kinetic studies Carbonylation of n-propanol The effect of catalyst (RhCIs- 3H^O) concentration, HI concentration, n-propanol concentration, CO partial pressure, agitation speed and temper- ature on the initial rate of total carbonylation was investigated. For each case, the initial rates were calculated from plots of the quantity of CO absorbed us. time. Since the reaction under consideration is a gas-liquid reaction, it is important to ensure that the rate data is obtained under con- ditions such that diffusional resistance is negligible. For this purpose, rates at different agitation speeds were observed. It was found that at the highest catalyst concentration (7.64 X 10\"\"6 mol cm\"3) and temperature (488 K) used, the rates were found to be independent of agitation speed. This sug- gests that in the range of conditions used in this work, mass transfer resis- tance is negligible and kinetic regime operates. The effect of various param- eters is discussed below. Effect of catalyst concentration: The effect of catalyst (RhCla-SHzO) concentration on the reaction rate has been studied at HI concentration of 0.72 X 10~3 mol cm\"3, n-propanol concentration of 2.66 X 10~3 mol cm\"3 and at 463 and 473 K. The results are shown in Fig. 5, which indicate that the reaction is first order with respect to catalyst concentration. Effect of HI concentration: The effect of HI concentration on the rate of carbonylation has been studied at a catalyst concentration of 3.82 X 10~6 mol cm\"3, n-propanol concentration of 2.66 X 10~3 mol cm\"3 and at 463 1-91 3-82 4-73 CATALYST CONCENTRATION X 10' mol cm-' Fig. 5.

A plot of the rate of carbonylation as a function of HI con- centration is presented in Fig. 6, which indicates a first-order dependency. Effect of n-propanol concentration: The reaction rate as a function of n-propanol concentration has been studied at a catalyst concentration of 3.82 X 10~6 mol cm-3, HI concentration of 0.72 X 10~3 mol cm\"3, and at 463 and 473 K. A plot of the rate us. n-propanol concentration is shown in Fig. 7. In this case, the rate was found to decrease with increasing n-propanol concentration. Similar observations have been reported earlier for carbonyla- tion of methanol, ethanol and isopropanol [2,11,12]. The substrate inhibi- tion is believed to be due to changes in the dielectric constant of the solvent system [2]. Effect of CO pressure: The influence of partial pressure of CO on the rate of carbonylation is shown in Fig. 8 for different temperatures. A zero order with respect to CO has been clearly observed at all temperatures. Rate model: The rate data were fitted to a power law rate equation of the following type: r^feoexp^.EV.R'rHAnBncnDp...

(2) 126 The magnitude of activation energy (23.3 kcal mol~1) further supports that the rate data were in a kinetically controlled regime. The rates predicted by eqn. (2) agreed within an average error of 4.5% with the \"experimental results. Carbonylotion of n-butanol The effect of catalyst (RhC^-H^O), HI, n-butanol concentrations, partial pressure of CO, temperature and agitation speed on total carbonyla- tion of n-butanol in acetic acid medium was studied following a procedure similar to that for n-propanol. In this case too, the initial results showed that effect of agitation speed on the initial rates is negligible and hence the data were in the kinetic regime. The results showing the influence of the various parameters are pre- sented in Figs. 9 to 12. The rates under identical conditions for n-butanol were found to be comparable to those observed for n-propanol (within 10%). Interestingly, the dependency of the rates on different parameters was also similar. The rate was found to be first order with respect to catalyst and HI concentrations, zero order with CO and negative order with respect to n-butanol concentration. The rate data were fitted using eqn. (1) and the values of rate constant, activation energy and reaction orders were evaluated by linear regression analysis. The following rate equation was found to represent the data satis- factorily. 0-00 1-91 3-82 4-73 7-64 CATALYST CONCENTRATION X 10 mol cm-' 9-55 Fig. 9.

Comparison of kinetics for different alcohols It is important to compare the kinetic features of carbonylation of n- alcohols using Rh complex catalyst. Earlier studies on carbonylation of methanol [2] and ethanol [12] were compared with the present results. While in methanol and ethanol reactions the corresponding acids were selectively formed, in the case of n-propanol and n-butanol isomeric car- boxylic acids were formed, with n-carboxylic acids as the predominant products. The kinetic features of the homologous series were found to be identical, in that the reaction was found to be zero order with CO, first order with catalyst and HI for all alcohols. The effect of alcohol concentra- tion showed typical substrate-inhibited kinetics again in all cases, but the influence was not very strong. For example, with a four-fold change in alcohol concentration, the rates varied between 30 - 50%. The average order of reaction for all alcohols was, however, not the same. On comparison of the rates of n-alcohols under identical conditions, it was observed that the rates varied in the following order: methanol > ethanol > n-propanol > n-butanol The similarity in the kinetics of n-alcohol carbonylations suggests that oxidative addition of alkyi iodide is the rate-controlling step in all cases. Conclusions Carbonylation of n-propanol and n-butanol using a homogeneous Rh complex catalyst was studied. The major products formed were n- and 129 isobutyric acids from n-propanol, and n- and isovaleric acids from n-butanol. The selectivity and n/iso ratios were found to be independent of the reaction conditions and conversion levels. The kinetics of carbonylation of n-propanol and n-butanol was studied and the following rate equations were found to represent the data satisfactorily. For n-propanol: r = 2.445 X 10-<23 300/ar)^0.936[B]0.381^-0.477 For n-butanol: r = 1.862 X lo-^44''0/^^]0-933^]0-968?]-0-441 The kinetics of carbonylation of homologous series of n-alcohols was com- pared, and showed a remarkable similarity in the kinetics with a difference in the rates and activation energies.
