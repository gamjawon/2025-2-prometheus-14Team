S. Fang, M. J. Kelley and B. C. Gates* Center for Catalytic Science and Technology, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716 (USA) (Received March 25, 1991; accepted October 11, 1991) Abstract Magnesia-supported catalysts were prepared from [Os3(CO)12], [H3Re3(CO),Z], a combination of the two, and [H3ReOs3(CO)13]. The catalysts were tested for hydrogenation of CO in a flow reactor, the surface structures were characterized by infrared spectroscopy and wet chemical extraction (cation metathesis), and the used catalysts were investigated with transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The catalysts all lost activity during operation; the catalyst made from the triosmium cluster lost activity as a result of being converted into the inactive [Os1oC(CO)24]2-, as observed previously. The catalyst made from the bimetallic cluster lost activity less rapidly than the others, and the IR spectra indicate that formation of the decaosmium cluster had been prevented by Re, which was present near the Os particles in the used catalyst. In contrast, when IOs3(CO)12] and [H3Re3(CO),Z] were used in combination, the formation of [Os,oC(CO)24]2- took place, the deactivation was relatively rapid, and there was negligible Re in the immediate neighborhood of the Os particles. Evidently, Re remote from the Os exerted no stabilizing effect. These results indicate an advantage of having the two metals initially bonded to each other in the catalyst precursor. Introduction A rich literature of supported catalysts prepared from bimetallic clusters has emerged in recent years [ 1, 2 ], but there are still few examples of such catalysts that have properties distinct from those of conventionally prepared bimetallic catalysts. In most of the supported catalysts prepared from bimetallic clusters, the two metals become segregated, often with one metal in a cationic form and the other in a metallic form. There are a few examples in which the metal ratio of the precursor metal cluster carbonyl is retained in metallic aggregates formed by decarbonylation and aggregation of the precursor [3]. The goal of this research was to investigate the roles of a pair of metals in catalysts in which the metals have a tendency to exist in discrete ionic or molecular structures on the support. Osmium was chosen as one of the metals because osmium carbonyls on basic MgO surfaces are converted into [H30S4(CO)121-, which appears to be a catalyst precursor for CO hydrogenation *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 0 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved 216 [4], and/or into [OSIOC(CO)24]2- [4, 5], which is catalytically inactive; the predominant cluster anion on the surface depends on the HZ/CO ratio in the gas phase. A strongly basic surface is required to stabilize the anionic clusters; when y-A1203 is used instead of MgO, metallic osmium particles are formed [6]. Rhenium, an oxophilic metal that is a common promoter in supported metal catalysts, was used in combination with osmium on a basic MgO support; the catalysts were prepared from [Os3(CO)12], [H3Re3(CO)12], from a combination of the two, and from [H3ReOs3(CO)13]. The catalysts were tested for CO hydrogenation since CO and H2 tend to stabilize anionic Os and Re structures on the basic support surface [4, 5]. The catalysts were also characterized by IR spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in attempts to understand the structures and roles of the two metals. Experimental Preparation of precursors and catalysts All syntheses and sample transfers were carried out with exclusion of air and moisture on a double-manifold Schlenk line, in a Vacuum Atmospheres glove box, or in flow systems described below. Hexanes were freshly distilled from sodium/benzophenone ketyl. Acetone (reagent grade) was dried over activated 4A molecular sieve particles, degassed, and stored under nitrogen. [Os3(CO)12], [Re2(CO)lo] and [PPN][Cl] were purchased from Strem and used as received. [H3ReOs3(CO)13] [7] and [H3Re3(CO)12] [8] were synthesized according to the literature methods. MgO powder (MX-65-1) was obtained from MCB. The MgO support was calcined by heating to 400 C in flowing oxygen for 2 h followed by evacuation (10-'-10-3 torr) for 12 h. The surface area of the treated powder was found to be 75 m2 g-1 by N2 adsorption. Each of the precursors, [H3ReOs3(CO)13], [Os3(CO)12] and [H3Re3(CO)12b was brought in contact with MgO from freshly distilled hexanes and allowed to adsorb at room temperature. Typically, 2 g of MgO was used with enough of the metal carbonyl precursor to give a total metal loading of approximately 1 wt.% on the MgO. Another sample was prepared from coadsorption of [Os3(CO)12] and [H3Re3(CO)12] on MgO in the presence of hexanes. After stirring the slurry for 4 h at 25 C, the solvent was removed by evacuation and the solid dried under vacuum for 12 h. Catalytic hydrogenation of CO A catalyst sample (ca. 0.5 g) was loaded into a copper-lined stainlesssteel tubular flow reactor (i.d. -1/4 in) inside a drybox without exposure to air. The catalyst temperature was increased at a rate of 2.5 C min-1 to 275 C with the sample in flowing hydrogen (flow rate=10 n-l min-1, NTP) and the temperature held at 275 C for 2 h at 1 atm. The reactor was then bypassed and the feed composition changed to H2 + CO (equimolar) at 1 atm. Then, at zero time on stream, the flow was switched back to the reactor. The total reactant flow rate was 10 ml min-', NTP. 217 The product stream flowed from the reactor to a gas chromatograph (GC) in a heat-traced line (temperature ca. 140 C) and was intercepted periodically for analysis. The GC was an Antek 300 equipped with a flame ionization detector. The products were separated in a Porapak Q column (i.d. -1/8 in, length= 10 ft) operated in a temperature-programmed mode with the column heated at a rate of 8 C min -' from 90 to 200 C and held at 200 C for 11 min. The C1-Cg hydrocarbons and oxygenated products (methanol, ethanol and dimethyl ether) were identified by their retention times; known gas mixtures were used to calibrate the GC. Before flowing to the reactor, CO (Matheson, UHP grade) and HZ (Matheson UHP grade), passed through activated 4A molecular sieve traps. HZ also flowed through a trap of CU20 to remove residual oxygen. CO also flowed through an activated carbon trap at 300 C to remove residual metal carbonyls. After an experiment, the catalyst was cooled to room temperature in flowing HZ + CO (equimolar). The used catalyst was removed from the reactor in the- glove box without exposure to air in preparation for further characterization. Catalyst characterization Fresh and used catalysts were characterized by IR spectroscopy with a Nicolet 7199 Fourier transform spectrometer; the procedures have been described [9]. Each catalyst sample was pressed into a thin self-supporting wafer and mounted in a controlled-atmosphere quartz cell equipped with NaCl windows. Fresh samples were treated in the cell in flowing hydrogen at 275 C and then in flowing HZ+CO (equimolar) at 275 C at 1 atm. The spectrum in the carbonyl stretching region was recorded for each sample. The resulting samples were brought in contact with solutions of [PPN][Cl] in acetone in attempts to extract surface anions by ion exchange (cation metathesis). Wafers of the used catalyst were also characterized and were brought in contact with excess [PPN][Cl] in acetone under nitrogen. The soluble products of the cation exchange were identified by IR spectroscopy of the extract solution. X-ray fluorescence measurements to determine the metal contents of the solid samples before and after use as catalysts were carried out with a Philips PW 1410/80 automated X-ray spectrometer. Standard calibration mixtures with various Re to Os ratios having Re and Os metal loadings in the range of 0.1-0.5 wt.% Re and 0.5-1.0 wt.% Os were prepared from [Os3(CO)1z], [Re2(CO),o], Y-A120s and boric acid (Alfa); no interference was observed between Re Lai and Os Lal emission lines. Metal particles on the support were examined with a Philips EM400T transmission electron microscope operated at 100 keV and equipped with an X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy accessory. Each sample was ground with an agate mortar and pestle, and the powder was dry-dispersed by rubbing between two microscope slides. The fine powder was brought in contact with and adhered to a holey carbon film coated on a Ti grid, which was mounted on a sample holder. This procedure was carried out under dry 218 nitrogen, but the sample was momentarily exposed to air when the sample holder was transferred from the dry nitrogen atmosphere and inserted into the side entry port of the microscope. Selected imaging areas (ca. 0.03-0.06 p,m2) were also examined with X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to determine the local relative composition of Re and Os (qualitatively) by using the Os and Re La emission lines. The Cu Ka emission line, which arises from the background (probably from the sample holder), was used as the internal energy reference for the ED spectra. Results and discussion Adsorption of metal carbonyls me Mg0 Each of the metal carbonyl precursors, [Os3(CO)12], [H3Re3(CO)12] and [H3ReOs3(CO)13], was adsorbed from hexane onto MgO powder, as demonstrated by the color changes of the white MgO powder. The uptake of the metals by the MgO was confirmed by X-ray fluorescence analysis of the solids; the quantitative results are summarized in Table 1. The Os:Re ratios differed significantly in the two bimetallic catalysts. Adsorption of [H3ReOs3 (CO),3J on basic Mg0 Deprotonation of some hydridocarbonyl clusters is facile on basic Mg0 and hydrated 'Y-A1203 [ 10 ]. The surface chemistry is analogous to that occurring in basic solutions and provides the means for anchoring metal clusters to surfaces. [H3Re3(CO)12] is deprotonated on magnesia to give [H2Re3(CO)12l [11]. Mixed-metal clusters [H2FeM3(CO)13] (M=Ru, Os), [HFeC03(CO)121 and [H2RuOs3(CO)13] react similarly with partially dehydroxylated Mg0 [121 and hydrated y-A1203 [ 13, 14 ] to form supported clusters. In this work, [H3ReOs3(CO)13] was brought in contact with partially dehydroxylated MgO. The carbonyl clusters are only sparingly soluble in hexanes, but after stirring for 4 h, the white MgO attained a uniform yellow TABLE 1 Rhenium and osmium contents of catalysts determined by X-ray fluorescence before and after use for CO hydrogenation a, b Catalyst precursor Fresh catalyst Used catalyst wt.% Os wt.% Re wt.% Os wt.% Re [H3ReOs3(CO),31 0.72 0.24 0.78 0.27 [Os3(CO)121 0.88 - 0.86 - [H3Re3(CO)121 - 0.84 _ 0.69 [Os3(CO)321+[H~,Re3(CO)IZ1 0.74 0.04 0.78 0.05 'Error: t 54'0.

The IR spectrum of the cluster-derived surface species is compared with the spectrum of a physical mixture of [HaRe083(CO)131 and KBr and that of the species formed from [ H3RUOs3(CO)13 ] adsorbed on partially dehydroxylated y -A1203 (Table 1). The red shift of the envelope of the carbonyl absorptions of the Mg0-supported cluster suggests that it reacted with Mg0 upon adsorption. A similar red shift in the carbonyl absorptions was observed when [H2RUOs3(CO)13] was deprotonated to form a monoanion on basic y A1203 [ 14 ] (Table 2). Cation metathesis with [PPN][Cl] in acetone was used in an attempt to identify surface anionic species formed from [H3ReOs3(CO)13] on MgO, and an orange-red extract solution was formed. The IR. spectrum of the supernatant solution was compared with the spectrum obtained when [PPN][Cl] was added to a yellow THF solution of [H3ReOs3(CO)13] (forming uncharacterized anions). After the addition of [PPN][CI] to the neutral cluster in THF, the red shift of the IR absorption envelope gave evidence that there was an increase in the -rr back-bonding from Os to the CO ligands. The known ability of [ PPN I [ Cl ] to deprotonate hydrido carbonyl clusters [ 15 ] , together with the close agreement of the IR spectrum of [Et4N][HRuOs3(CO)13] in CH2C12 and that of the species formed from [H3Re083(CO)13]+[PPN][CI] in THF (Table 2), strongly implies that [H3ReOs3(CO)13] was transformed into an anion in the presence of [PPN][CI].

The products were hydrocarbons, predominantly methane. The activities are low in comparison with those of conventional supported metal catalysts exemplified by Os/y-A1203 [ 6 ]. Blank experiments carried out with only the MgO support in the reactor showed no conversion of CO + H2. The supported Re, Os and Re-Os catalysts all lost activity during operation. The deactivation of Mg0-supported osmium catalysts prepared from osmium carbonyls has been observed before [4, 5] and associated with the formation of [OSIOC(CO)z4]2- under catalytic CO hydrogenation conditions. Similar results were observed in this work. All the catalysts were characterized by low conversions (< 13%) (Table 3), which were assumed to be differential. Rates were calculated from the conversion data; typical results are shown in Fig. 1, demonstrating that the TABLE 3 Activities of Mg0-supported osmium and rhenium CO hydrogenation catalysts Catalyst precursor Percentage conversion of CO to hydrocarbon' [H3Reos3(CO),3] 12.6 [Os3(CO),2] 3.3 [HaRe3(CO),z] 4.9 [Os3(CO)121 + [H3Re3(CO),zj 5.4 'Reaction conditions: 275 C, 1 atm, and Hz:CO =1.0 (molar), 19 t 2 h on stream time. 10 2 Samples derived from p [H3Re0S3(CO),31 0 10s3(CO)121 H 7a [H3Re3(CO)121 O p + [Os3(CO)121+ IH.Re3(CO)1Z] c I-J_, 1 07 3 + M'-L.I~i~l A&+++ o o + 000 AAA a n + +++o o+ 0 ++ o .4 10 0 500 1000 1500 On Stream Time, min Fig. 1.

Products heavier than C4 were not observed, except for traces of Cb. Methane was the major product of the reaction for each catalyst (Table 4). There were differences between the catalysts in the olefin to paraffin ratio. This ratio was greater for the catalysts containing Re. Similar product distributions were observed for the catalyst derived from the mixed-metal cluster and the catalyst prepared from the coadsorption of monometallic carbonyl clusters (Table 4). The rate of methane formation declined less rapidly for the catalyst prepared from [H3Re0S3(CO)13] than for the catalyst prepared from [Os3(CO)121 and [H3Re3(CO)121 in the first 5 h on stream (Pig. 1). The rate of CO conversion (based on hydrocarbon formed per g of metal per h) observed for the catalyst prepared from [H3ReOs3(CO)131 was twice that observed for the catalysts prepared from [Os3(CO)121 and from [H3Re3(CO)12] after approximately 20 h on stream. The stability of a sample prepared from the coadsorption of [Os3(CO)121 and [H3Re3(CO),2] was similar to that of a sample derived from [Os3(CO)121 but different from that of the sample prepared from the mixed-metal cluster. Characterization of used catalysts by IR spectroscopy and extraction The used catalysts were examined by IR spectroscopy. The spectrum in the carbonyl region of the catalyst prepared from [H3Re3(CO)121 on Mg0 has bands at 2019(s), 1998(m,sh), 1900(vs), 1876(s,sh) and 1862(s,sh) cm-1. Attempts to identify surface anions on the used catalyst by extraction with [PPN][Cl] revealed no carbonyl species in the extract, as indicated by IR spectroscopy. In the spectrum of the used catalyst derived from [Os3(CO)121 on MgO, carbonyl bands were observed at 2080(w,sh), 2038(s,br), and 1990(s,br) cm-1 [5, 161 (Mg. 2).

Catalyst prepared from (A) [H3ReOs3(CO),3] adsorbed on MgO; (B) [Os3(CO)12] adsorbed on MgO; (C) [H3Re3(CO)12] and [Os3(CO),2] adsorbed on MgO; (D) [H3Re3(CO)1z] absorbed on MgO. [PPN1[CII formed a reddish-pink solution with absorptions at 2035(s) and 1990(s) cm-1, confirming [171 the presence of [Os1oC(CO)2412- as the adsorbed surface anion. The catalyst prepared from the coadsorption Of [OSg(CO)121 and [H3Re3(CO)121 on MgO exhibited this same IR pattern, both in the spectra of the solid sample and the extract solution. In contrast, the spectrum of the used catalyst prepared from [H3ReOs3(CO)131 showed abroad absorption envelope with bands at 2021(s,br) and 1912(m,sh) cm-1. Attempts to extract anions from the surface of the used catalyst derived from the bimetallic cluster with [PPN1[Cl] showed no carbonyl absorptions in the extract solution. This result suggests that the predominant surface species that existed in the mixed-metal cluster-derived catalyst was neither [OSIOC(CO)2412- nor the surface species derived from Mg0-supported [H3Re3(CO)121 after catalytic CO hydrogenation. The surface species in the used catalyst derived from the mixed-metal cluster remain to be identified. Genesis of the supported catalyst: characterization by IR spectroscopy To gain an understanding of the transformation of the catalyst precursors under CO hydrogenation conditions, IR spectroscopy was carried out with samples in the presence of CO + H2. Each fresh catalyst sample was pressed into a thin self-supporting wafer and treated in H2 at 275 C for 2 h and 223 then in CO + HZ (equimolar) at 275 C for 2 h. Spectra were measured intermittently to monitor the evolution of the surface species. After 0.5 h at 150 C, the surface species derived from [Os3(CO)12] on MgO in flowing hydrogen was characterized by IR bands at 2101(w), 2070(m), 1999(s) and 1948(m,sh) cm-1. This pattern is similar to that of the sample made from [Os3(CO)12] adsorbed on Mg0 (measured under nitrogen at room temperature) (Fig. 213, Table 5), suggesting that the initial surface species remained nearly intact. Subsequent treatment at 275 C in hydrogen for 2 h resulted in a spectrum with a two-band pattern [2019(s) and 1911(s,br) cm-11 similar to that of the surface species proposed [ 18 ] to be [Os(CO)2{HO-Mg}4] (FIg. 3C). Here the braces represent groups at the Mg0 surface. The formation of the mononuclear subcarbonyl species implies that the original cluster framework had been disrupted. After treatment of hydrogen-treated sample prepared from [Os3(CO)12] with an equimolar mixture of H2 + CO at 275 C for 2 h, bands became evident at 2033(s,br) and 1987(s,br) cm-', characterizing surface-bound [Os1OC(CO)24]2-. Extraction of the IR wafer with excess [PPN][Cl] in acetone resulted in a reddish-pink solution with absorptions at 2035(vs) and 1990(vs) cm-1, confirming the presence of surface-bound [Os1OC(CO)24]2-. This result agrees with the IR spectrum obtained with the used [Os3(CO)12]-derived catalyst and explains the relatively rapid deactivation of the catalyst, at least TABLE 5 IR stretching frequencies of molecular complexes Metal carbonyls v(CO) Ref.

[22, 23] observed a similar pattern with a CO hydrogenation catalyst containing 1 wt.% Re on Ti02 [2030(s), 1995(m), 1920(m,br) and 1885(sh) cm-']. On the basis of the close agreement in the intensity and position of the bands observed at 2020(s) and 1906(vs) cm-' in our sample with those of the Re subcarbonyl species reported by Kirlin et al. [191, we suggest that they be assigned to the Re subcarbonyl species with the formulation [Re(CO)3{O-Mg}{HO-Mg}2]. The remaining absorptions at 1996(m,sh) and 1875(m,sh) cm-' are now tentatively assigned to surface species with the formulation of [Re(CO)3{HO-Mg}3]. This assignment is based on the close agreement between the IR spectrum of the surface species and that of the complex [NEt4][(CO)3Re(OMe)3Re(CO)3] (1990(s) and 1875(vs) cm-' [20]) since the local symmetry coordinates for the carbonyl stretching modes of the [Re(CO)3L] moiety [L=(OMe)3 or fH0-Mg}3] in the rhenium-methoxy complex and the Re subcarbonyl can be described by a C3 point group. This tentative formulation reconciles the observed red shift in the IR frequencies relative to that of [Re(CO)3{O-Mg}{HO-Mg}Z]. The MgO surface used in this experiment was highly populated with Bronsted basic sites that can act as o- donors for the Re subcarbonyl species, leading to an increase in Tr backbonding to the CO ligands. Efforts were made to determine the presence of surface-bound anions by cation exchange with [ PPN ] [ Cl ]. No observable carbonyl absorptions were found in the extract solution, from which it is inferred that no extractable anions were formed on the MgO surface under the CO hydrogenation conditions. IR spectra show that the surface species derived from [H3ReOs3(CO),3] on MgO began to be decarbonylated in flowing hydrogen at 150 C; bands appeared at 2086(m), 2051(s), 2022(vs), 1995(m,sh), 1932(m,br) and 1888(m,sh) cm-' (Fig. 5B). At 275 C, bands appeared at 2021(s,br), 1906(s,br) and 1874(s,br) cm-'. The bands at 2021 and 1906 cm-' are assigned to [Os(CO)2{HO-Mg}4] (Mg. 5C). Similar IR bands were observed when the Mg0-supported sample prepared from [Os3(CO)12] was treated in Hz at 275 C. The remaining band at 1874 cm-' is assigned to Re(CO)3fH0-Mg}3]2- (1996 and 1874 cm-'); the band characteristic of this species at 1996 cm-' is overlapped by the intense absorption at 2021 cm-' of the Os subcarbonyl. The formation of both Re and Os subcarbonyls indicates that the metal frame of the carbonyl cluster had been disrupted, probably as a result of reaction with surface hydroxo or A,-oxo groups upon heating in hydrogen [11, 24]. The redox reactions observed between the surface hydroxo and p,-oxo groups and the supported mixed-metal cluster upon heating in flowing hydrogen are similar to the reactions of the monometallic counterparts that result in the formation of the subcarbonyl species. In contrast, after treatment for 2 h at 275 C in equimolar CO + H2, the spectrum of the sample prepared from [H3ReOs3(CO)13] adsorbed on Mg0 showed broad peaks, with absorptions at 2000(s,br) and 1920(s,sh) cm-' (Mg. 5D). No resemblance was observed between this spectrum and the 226 D C U B A 2200 2000 1800 Wavenumbers, cm -1 Fig. 5.

After the IR experiment, the wafer was treated with [PPN][Cl] in an attempt to identify any exchangeable surface-bound anions. No products having carbonyl bands were found in the extract solution. This result supports the findings of the catalytic experiment, showing that surface-bound [OsIOC(CO)2412 anions did not form after catalytic CO hydrogenation. Therefore, the organo-osmium surface chemistry on basic MgO characteristic of the [H3ReOs3(CO),3]-derived sample is different from that characteristic of the [Os3(CO)12]-derived sample. Although Os(II) subcarbonyl species were observed in Mg0-supported samples derived from [H3ReOs3(CO)13] and from [Os3(CO)12] after treatment in hydrogen at 275 C, [OsIOC(CO)2412- was formed after HZ+CO treatment of the latter sample, but not the former, as indicated by the IR spectra. The condensation of the mononuclear surface species to form decanuclear clusters indicates the mobility of the mononuclear surface species (probably anionic species) on the basic MgO surface under CO+H2. The lack of formation of [OSIOC(CO)24]2- in HZ+CO from the OS(II) subcarbonyl species formed by treatment in hydrogen of the Mg0-supported [H3ReOs3(CO)13]-derived catalyst suggests that there was a close interaction between Re and Os surface species hindering the condensation reaction of the osmium carbonyls on the Mg0 surface. 227 Characterization of used catalysts by electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis Used catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy to provide information about metal particles on the surface, and selected regions were characterized with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to determine local compositions. From each used catalyst sample, 30 to 40 MgO crystallites were examined on three different Ti grids to provide statistically reliable data.. A typical electron micrograph of the sample derived from [Os3(CO)121 after catalytic CO hydrogenation is shown in Fig. 6. Small scattering centers (with dimensions of ca. 15 A or less) with a narrow size distribution are evident. The ED spectrum indicates the presence of Os (Mg. 7A), and the scattering centers are identified as Os. The small size and narrow size Fig. 6. Typical transmission electron micrograph of a used catalyst prepared from [Os3(CO)32]. 228 distribution (in agreement with the results of the cation metathesis and III experiments) are consistent with the inference that decaosmium carbonyl clusters had formed on the MgO surface. In contrast, no observable aggregates were found in the used sample prepared from [H3Re3(CO)12) at the same magnification, but the presence of Re was confirmed by EDS (Erg. 713). This evidence is in agreement with the IR results indicating that Re subcarbonyls were the predominant surface species on the MgO surface after the CO hydrogenation catalysis. A representative electron micrograph of the sample formed from [H3ReOs3(CO)131 is shown in F1g. 8. The average aggregate size is ca. 15 A; there is a narrow distribution of sizes. The ED spectrum (Mg. 7C) indicates the presence of both Re and Os in the selected image area. The result demonstrates that the mixed-metal carbonyl cluster leads to a catalyst with Re located in the proximity of Os on the support. In contrast, the ED spectrum characterizing a region near a metal particle in a used catalyst prepared from the coadsorption of [Os3(CO)1Zj and [H3Re3(CO)121 (Mg. 7D) shows Os but not Re, suggesting a lack of Re in the immediate neighborhood of Os. Several crystallites of the latter sample were examined, but the Re signal in the ED spectrum was always either very weak or absent. The lack of significant concentrations of Re in the immediate neighborhood of Os can be explained by the postulate that Re and Os were predominantly located in different regions on the support.

Typical transmission electron nticrograph of used catalyst prepared from [H3ReOs3(CO),31. The metal particles in the sample prepared from [Os3(CO)121 and [H3Re3(CO)12] have dimensions of ca. 15 A or less, and some lie on stepped surfaces of the MgO, indicated by the arrow in Fig. 9. Similar results were obtained by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy with samples prepared by depositing [OS1pC(CO)2412- directly on Mg0 [25]. The Os clusters were located preferentially along MgO surface steps and were nearly uniform in size. These results are consistent with the ER and extraction data, indicating the formation of inactive decanuclear osmium clusters under the catalytic CO hydrogenation reaction conditions in the sample prepared from [Os3(CO)121 and [H3Re3(CO)121. In summary, osmium particles with dimensions of - 15 A or less and narrow size distributions formed, and Re was in the proximity of Os in the [H3ReOs3(CO)13]-derived catalyst but not in the catalyst derived from [Os3(CO)121 + [H3Re3(CO)121. The relatively high stability of the catalyst derived Fig. 9. Typical transmission electron micrograph of used catalyst prepared from [Os3(CO),21 and [H3Re3(CO),z1. from the mixed-metal cluster is inferred to be a consequence of the Re in the vicinity of the Os particles on the support. Nature of the catalytic species Both rhenium and osmium alone on MgO form catalytically active species. [H3O34(CO)12]- has been suggested to be a precursor of the active species formed from osmium carbonyls on Mg0 [4], but the active species formed from [H3Re3(CO)12] and those formed from the combination of Re and Os are unknown. The results show an advantage in catalyst activity maintenance resulting from the use of [H3ReOs3(CO)13] rather than the combination of [Os3(CO)12] and [H3Re3(CO)12]. The EDS data for the used bimetallic catalysts give evidence that Re was present near the osmium particles in the former but not the latter. The catalytic and EDS data therefore point to a role of 231 Re initially present in the bimetallic clusters in stabilizing the Os catalyst, and the IR and microscopy results indicate the role of this Re in hindering the formation of the catalytically inactive [OSIOC(CO)24]2-. We infer that the initial proximity of the Re and Os in the bimetallic cluster leads to a proximity of the two metals in the working catalyst and that this is the essential characteristic that distinguishes the bimetallic cluster-derived catalyst from the catalyst formed from the two monometallic clusters. The IR spectra indicate that Re was present in the form of mononuclear carbonyls. The evidence suggests, therefore, that low-valent Re cations in the proximity of Os affect the organo-osmium surface chemistry on basic MgO. A strong Re-Os interaction may inhibit the condensation reaction of osmium carbonyls on MgO, possibly by hindering the transport of the osmium carbonyls on the surface. The results illustrate a delicate balance between Os-Re and Os-MgO interactions. Since a strong Re-Os interaction was not observed in the catalyst formed by the coadsorption~of monometallic Re and Os carbonyl clusters on MgO, it is concluded that the mixed-metal cluster is an appealing catalyst precursor for preparation of supported Re-Os catalysts with some degree of control of the structure and composition; similar results are anticipated for other bimetallic clusters when one of the metals is oxophilic (like Re) and the other tends to form clusters. The results of the characterization of the Re-Os mixed-metal clusterderived catalyst support the postulate of the presence of low-valent Re cations in the Mg0-supported catalysts. A role of Re may be to provide dehydrogenation sites. This hypothesis is supported by the result that the supported Re catalyst gives a higher olefin to paraffin ratio in the CO hydrogenation products that the supported Os catalyst. [Re(CO)3fH0-Mg}3] is a potential precursor for the dehydrogenation sites. Reductive elimination as the chain-terminating step in the FSscher-Tropsch reaction is favored by a /3-hydride elimination, resulting in the formation of a-olefins as the primary products [26]. [Re(CO)3{HO-Mg}3] may act as a nucleophile and enhance the hydride elimination from the adsorbed hydrocarbon on Os. The postulated role of the Re species is supported by the infrared spectra characterizing the Mg0supported Re catalyst under flowing CO + Hz. The deactivation of the support Re catalyst parallels the increasing intensity of the III bands corresponding to [Re(CO)3{O-Mg}{HO-Mg}2] and the decreasing intensity of the bands corresponding to [Re(CO)3fH0-Mg}3] (Figs. 4C and D). Furthermore, the close proximity of Re to Os in the mixed-metal cluster-derived catalyst might influence the local hydrogen concentration on Os, leading to the observation of different organo-osmium surface chemistry on basic MgO. Conclusions A Mg0-supported catalyst prepared from [H3ReOs3(CO)13] has greater stability for CO hydrogenation at 1 atm and 275 C than a Mg0-supported catalyst prepared from [Os3(CO)12] or one prepared from [Os3(CO)12] and [H3Re3(CO)12 ]. The improvement in activity maintenance is correlated with 232 the lack of surface-bound [OSIOC(CO)24]2- anions, which are inactive. The presence of Re in proximity to Os is suggested to modify the surface organo-osmium chemistry. The olefin to paraffin ratio in the products of CO hydrogenation suggests that Re influences the chain-termination step; Re is postulated to provide dehydrogenation sites.

Magnesia-supported catalysts were prepared from [Os3(CO)12], [H3Re3(CO)12], a combination of the two, and [H3ReOs3(CO)13]. The catalysts were tested for hydrogenation of CO in a flow reactor, the surface structures were characterized by infrared spectroscopy and wet chemical extraction (cation metathesis), and the used catalysts were investigated with transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The catalysts all lost activity during operation; the catalyst made from the triosmium cluster lost activity as a result of being converted into the inactive [OS10C(CO)24]2−, as observed previously. The catalyst made from the bimetallic cluster lost activity less rapidly than the others, and the IR spectra indicate that formation of the decaosmium cluster had been prevented by Re, which was present near the Os particles in the used catalyst. In contrast, when [Os3(CO)12] and [H3Re3(CO)12] were used in combination, the formation Of [Os10C(CO)24]2− took place, the deactivation was relatively rapid, and there was negligible Re in the immediate neighborhood of the Os particles. Evidently, Re remote from the Os exerted no stabilizing effect. These results indicate an advantage of having the two metals initially bonded to each other in the catalyst precursor. References 1 P.

The catalyst made from the bimetallic cluster lost activity less rapidly than the others, and the IR spectra indicate that formation of the decaosmium cluster had been prevented by Re, which was present near the Os particles in the used catalyst. In contrast, when [Os3(CO)12] and [H3Re3(CO)12] were used in combination, the formation Of [Os10C(CO)24]2− took place, the deactivation was relatively rapid, and there was negligible Re in the immediate neighborhood of the Os particles. Evidently, Re remote from the Os exerted no stabilizing effect. These results indicate an advantage of having the two metals initially bonded to each other in the catalyst precursor.",
