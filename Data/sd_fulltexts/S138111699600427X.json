Box 110, Dalian 116023, China h State Key Laboratory of MR and AMP, Wuhan Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China Received 15 August 1996; accepted 18 October 1996 Abstract By using a high-resolution solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer with 27AI and Z9Si probes, the interaction between Mo species and HZSM-5 of Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied. The results show that there is a strong interaction between Mo species and HZSM-5 zeolite. The framework aluminum in the zeolite can be easily extracted by the introduction of Mo species. The extractability of framework aluminum by Mo species increases with increasing Mo loading and the calcination temperature. The extraction process leads to the formation of non-framework A1 at first and then a new crystalline phase of A12(Mo04)3. The dealumination of the catalyst having a Mo loading of 15% and had been calcined at 973 K is so severe that all the aluminum in the framework are extracted and no framework A1 could be detected by 27AI MAS NMR. The catalyst, therefore, lost its catalytic activity for methane dehydrogenation and aromatization in the absence of oxygen. The Si/Al ratio measured from Z9Si MAS NMR further confirms the dealumination process observed by Z7AI MAS NMR. The MAS NMR results give us an evidence that A12(M004)3 crystallites are much less active for the reaction. Keywords: 27A1 and 29Si MAS lumination; Mo/HZSM-5; AIZ(MOO4)3; Methane activation 1. Introduction Recently Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts have been reported to be active for methane conversion without adding OZ for the formation of aromatics [1-4]. The outstanding catalytic property of the catalyst has been attributed to its acidity and channel structure and the location and state of Mo species on/in HZSM-5 zeolite [2,5]. Our Corresponding author. 1381-1169/97/$17.00 Copyright 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. P11 S1381-1169(96)00427-X previous studies have shown that, after impregnation of HZSM-5 with ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM) solution and calcination, some kinds of interaction may happen between Mo species and HZSM-5 which lead to an obvious decrease in BET surface area and strong acidity of HZSM-5 [6,7]. At the same time, the location and coordination of Mo species and their reducibilities change a lot. Moreover, insitu XPS examination revealed obviously that the valence state of Mo species also changes because CH4 is a quite strong reducing agent, 258 W. Liu et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 120 (1997) 257-265 particularly at a reaction temperature as high as 973 K [8]. XRD and FT-IR observations also show that M003 and A12(Mo04)3 crystallites have been formed depending on Mo loading and calcination temperature [6,7]. It seems that the interaction between Mo species and HZSM-5 is complicated. The situation can be even more complicated, since as far as the interaction between Mo species and HZSM-5 is concerned, the other important aspect is that the extraction of framework Al will be more severe by introduction of Mo species on/in the zeolite such as HY [9]. Therefore, the knowledge of the coordination and quantification of the different Al species is also essential in understanding the reactivity of Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst for methane dehydrogenation and aromatization in the absence of oxygen. It is well known that zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates composed of silicon-oxygen and aluminum-oxygen tetrahedra. The aluminum atom has a nuclear spin of 5/2 and therefore a nuclear quadrupole moment which can interact with the electric field gradient at the site of the nucleus caused by surrounding ions. For a perfect tetrahedral surrounding of aluminum by four oxygens, the electric field gradient is zero. Any distortion of this tetrahedron, however, should cause a field gradient at the aluminum site and consequently, a quadrupole interaction of the aluminum nuclear spin. So 27AI MAS-NMR is a powerful technique to provide direct information pertaining to the local environment of these Al nuclei in zeolite structures [10-13]. Meanwhile, 2951 MAS-NMR is a very important method that offers us a direct measurement of the various ways which aluminum atoms are coordinated to Si atoms in the framework of zeolites [14-16]. In principle, from 29Si MAS-NMR spectra, the ratio of silicon to aluminum in the framework (Si/Al) can be determined. In this paper, we report the results obtained from 2' Al and 29SMAS-NMR measurements of Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts with different Mo load ing and calcining at different temperatures. The effects on the structure of HZSM-5 zeolite after introducing Mo species were evaluated in order to shed more light on the nature of the interaction between Mo species and HZSM-5 zeolite. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation HZSM-5 zeolite with a S2/A1203 ratio of 50 was supplied by the NanKai University and was used without further treatment. Catalysts with Mo loading of 3% and 15% were prepared by impregnating HZSM-5 with aqueous solutions of ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM). The samples were then dried at 383 K overnight and calcined in air at the desired temperatures for 6 h. They were coded as xMo/HZ-y hereafter, where x is the nominal content of Mo in the sample, and y is the calcination temperature of the sample. 2.2. NMR measurements The NMR measurements were performed using a Bruker 400-MSL spectrometer with a magnetic field of 9.4 T. 27A1 and 2951 MAS-NMR were performed at 104.2 and 79.46 MHz, respectively. Magic angle spinning speeds of 4 kHz were used for both. The recycle time was 0.5 s for 27A1 and 10 s for 29Si. The sweep width was 41.67 kHz for 2'A1 and 31.25 kHz for 29Si, and chemical shifts are referred to TMS and dilute Al(N03)3 solution. Short 7r/9 radio frequency (rf) pulses were employed for 2'Al spectra and 7r/3 rf pulses were used for 29Si spectra. The different profiles in the 29Si spectra were deconvoluted using Jandel Scientific Peakfit program. The best fits of the 29Si spectra were obtained with Gaussian and Lorentzian line forms. 2.3. XRD measurement X-ray powder diffraction patterns were obtained on a Rigaku diffractometer using Cu K a W. Liu et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 120 (1997) 257-265 radiation at room temperature. Powder diffractograms of samples were recorded over a range of 20 values from 5-50under the conditions of 40 kV and 100 mA at a scanning rate of 8 deg/min. All the XRD patterns recorded can be processed with a computer system attached to the instrument. 2.4. Methane dehydrogenation and aromatization A catalytic test was performed with a fixed bed continuous flow quartz reactor as mentioned in a previous paper [2]. Briefly, the catalyst charge was 0.2 g with particle size ranging from 40 to 60 mesh. The tail gas was sampled after 40 min running and analyzed by Shimadzu GC-9AM chromatography. The conversion of methane and selectivity of products were calculated on the basis of carbon number balance. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. The thermal stability of Mo / HZSM-5 catalysts revealed from 27AI MAS NMR spectra 27AI MAS-NMR offers a strong and effective instrument for characterizing the structure of zeolites. It can discriminate between framework aluminum atoms in tetrahedral coordination and non-framework aluminum atoms in octahedral coordination or penta-coordination [10-13]. The samples must be hydrated enough in order to reduce the 27AI NMR line width which is mainly caused by the quadrupolar interaction of the aluminum nuclear spin. 27AI MAS-NMR spectra of 3Mo and 15Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts together with HZSM5 zeolite calcined at different temperatures are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. There are two main peaks as expected. One at 53 ppm, which is typical for tetrahedrally coordinated framework aluminum in ZSM-5 zeolite, and the other at 0 ppm, which can be attributed to octahedral non-framework aluminum. 259 A 8o 6o 4o 2o o -20 PPM Fig. 1. 27AI MAS-NMR spectra of HZSM-5 zeolite calcined at 773 K (A) and 973 K (B) and 3Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts calcined at 773 K (C); 873 K (D); 923 K (E) and 973 K (F). The 27AI MAS-NMR spectra of HZSM-5 calcined at 773 K and 973 K are similar and this shows the high thermal stability of HZSM-5 framework. The thermal stability of the HZSM-5 framework seems to change with Mo loading and calcination temperature. For the So 6o 4o 2o o -2o PPM Fig. 2. 27AI MAS-NMR spectra of HZSM-5 zeolite calcined at 773 K (A) and 973 K (B) and 15Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts calcined at 773 K (C); 873 K (D) and 973 K (E). 260 W. Liu et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 120 (1997) 257-265 3Mo/HZSM-5 sample, only little change could be detected on the NMR spectra if the sample was calcined at 773 K. This means that the original framework of HZSM-5 zeolite is remained if Mo loading is as low as 3% and calcined at 773 K. However, with increasing calcination temperature, the amount of nonframework aluminum increases. At the same time, the corresponding peak width also increases as shown in Fig. 1. The increase in the amount of non-framework aluminum for 3Mo/HZSM-5 samples with calcination temperatures shows that Mo species interact with framework aluminum. The interaction is so strong with increasing calcination temperature that aluminum is extracted by Mo species from the framework of zeolite. The increase in the line width of 27AI MAS NMR spectra implies an increase in the quadrupolar interaction between the octahedral coordinated aluminum and water molecules, since the magic angle spinning cannot eliminate the quadrupolar interaction. On the one hand, there may be an overlapping resonance with chemical shift at 30 ppm which may be assigned to penta-coordinated non-framework aluminum [12,13]. Because of the relative low spinning frequency in our experiments (about 4 kHz), the spectrum is not well resolved. Although the intensity of the peak at 0 ppm increased obviously when 3Mo/HZSM-5 was calcined at 973 K, a large portion of the framework aluminum of HZSM-5 remained. For the high Mo loaded sample, 15Mo/HZSM-5, the effect of calcination temperature on dealumination is even more severe. Only a small difference between 15Mo/HZSM5 and HZSM-5 could be detected, if they were both calcined at 773 K for 6 h. The interaction between Mo species and HZSM-5 is not strong AI:(~,), Moo, D .h.n, 20 2 6 B A 40 5o Fig. 3. XRD patterns for different samples.

With increasing calcination temperatures, the interaction becomes severe as shown in Fig. 2d. A new peak with a chemical shift at - 15 ppm appeared. The peak is attributed to octahedral aluminum ion in crystalline Al2(Mo04)3 [17]. If 15Mo/HZSM-5 was calcined at 973 K for 6 h, the 2'A, MAS-NMR spectrum has only one peak at -15 ppm. The peaks at 53 ppm and 0 ppm reflecting the existence of framework and non-framework aluminum, respectively, cannot be detected. The formation of new A12(Mo04)3 crystalline phase has also been confirmed by XRD (Fig. 3). The above results show that Mo species interact with the framework aluminum of HZSM-5 zeolite, and the interaction increases with increasing Mo loading and calcination temperature. The strong interaction finally leads to the extraction of framework aluminum and the formation of new Alz(Mo04)3 crystalline phase. 3.2. The changes in the ratios of Si/Al of Mo / HZSM-5 catalysts revealed from 29Si MAS-NMR spectra The framework Si/Al ratio can be deter- mined according to the equation given by Kli nowski [18]: ~ 4 4 1 SI/AI- ~, ISi(nAl) Y, 4nISi(nAl) n=0 n=0 where Isi(nAi) is the intensity of the individual Si(nAl) peaks (% area) obtained from the deconvoluted spectra. The 29Si MAS-NMR spectra are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, for 3Mo/HZSM-5 and 15Mo/HZSM-5 calcined at different temperatures, respectively. The corresponding deconvoluted spectra showing the separate peaks are shown in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. The chemical shifts and the peak areas of Si(nAl) resonance calculated by curve fitting with Gaussian and Lorentzian line shapes are shown in Table 1.

For ZSM-5 zeolite, only SOO and Si(lAl) configurations exist because its Si02/A1203 ratio is larger than 12 [19,20]. From Figs. 6 and 7, we can see that there are three peaks in 29Si MAS-NMR spectra with chemical shifts at -106 ppm, -112 ppm, and -115 ppm. The first one can be attributed to Si(1 Al), and the other two can be attributed to Si(OAl) [21]. Table 1 list the results in more detail. For the samples of HZ-773 zeolite, 3Mo/HZ-773 and 15Mo/HZ-773, the Si/Al ratios calculated from the spectra are 22.51, 22.73, and 22.96, respectively. These data clearly show that the dealumination is negligible at this stage, no matter with or without Mo species. With increasing calcination temperature, the ratios of Si/Al in the framework are increasing sharply. For example, the Si/Al ratio of 3Mo/HZ-873 and 15Mo/HZ-873 is 52.02 and 132.0, respectively. The intensity of Si(lAl) in this 15Mo/HZ-873 sample decreases seri ously. As we can see from Table 1, the Si/Al ratio for 15Mo/HZ-973 is nearly infinite. Only a weak peak is seen with chemical shift at -110 ppm, as shown by amorphous Si, which indicates the framework structure of ZSM-5 zeolite is no longer existed. The result is in agreement with that obtained from 27 Al MAS NMR. The framework of HZSM-5 is stable in Mo/HZSM-5 with low Mo loading and calcination temperature. The Si/Al ratio of the framework in the samples is hardly changed. With increasing Mo loading and calcination temperature, the interaction between Mo species and HZSM-5 zeolite intensifies which at last leads to severe dealumination of the framework of HZSM-5.

The extraction of aluminum from the framework of HY zeolite by Mo species has been reported by Ezzamarty [9]. Mo species prefer to attack the Si sites with more A1 atoms attached to it and extract aluminum from the framework. Although the number of Al atom coordinated Si atom in HZSM-5 is not as high as that in HY zeolite in one unit cell, the interaction leading to dealumination of the framework is still very strong in 15Mo/HZ973 sample. 3.3.

The conversion of methane over HZSM-5 is 0.1 %. It is very low compared with the methane conversion on Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts. The best activity for methane dehydrogenation and aromatization is obtained on 3Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts calcined at 773 K and 873 K where the methane conversion reaches 6.3% and the selectivity to aromatics is about 90%. For 15Mo/HZ-773, although the conversion is lower, the selectivity to aromatics is still higher than 90%. With increasing calcination temperature, for 15Mo/HZ-973, the conversion of methane and the selectivity to aromatics decrease dramatically. Methane is hardly activated on this catalyst. After running for 2 h, the methane conversion is 0.2% and the selectivity to aromatics is 43.4%. By combining the cat- (B) -110 -120 PPM Fig. 7.

Conclusion Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts for methane dehydrogenation and aromatization have been studied by using 27AI and 29Si MAS-NMR. It was found that there is a strong interaction between Mo species and the framework aluminum in HZSM5. With increasing Mo loading and calcination temperatures, the interaction develops so strong that all the aluminum in the framework can be extracted by Mo species, and at last forms a new A12(Mo04)3 crystalline phase. The framework of ZSM-5 zeolite collapses at the end, and the catalytic activity for methane dehydrogenation and aromatization drops dramatically. On the basis of these results, it is confirmed that the formation of A12(Mo04)3 crystallite is a main detrimental factor for methane dehydrogenation and aromatization on Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts in the absence of oxygen.

By using a high-resolution solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer with 27Al and 29Si probes, the interaction between Mo species and HZSM-5 of frsol|Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied. The results show that there is a strong interaction between Mo species and HZSM-5 zeolite. The framework aluminum in the zeolite can be easily extracted by the introduction of Mo species. The extractability of framework aluminum by Mo species increases with increasing Mo loading and the calcination temperature. The extraction process leads to the formation of non-framework Al at first and then a new crystalline phase of Al2(MoO4)3. The dealumination of the catalyst having a Mo loading of 15% and had been calcined at 973 K is so severe that all the aluminum in the framework are extracted and no framework Al could be detected by 27Al MAS NMR. The catalyst, therefore, lost its catalytic activity for methane dehydrogenation and aromatization in the absence of oxygen. The Si Al ratio measured from 29Si MAS NMR further confirms the dealumination process observed by 27Al MAS NMR. The MAS NMR results give us an evidence that Al2(MoO4)3 crystallites are much less active for the reaction.
