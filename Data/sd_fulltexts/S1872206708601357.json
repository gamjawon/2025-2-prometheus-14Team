DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(08)60135-7 Preparation of MoO 3 -CeO 2 -SiO 2 Oxidative Desulfurization Catalysts by a Sol-Gel Procedure ZHANG Jian 1 , BAI Xiumei 1 , LI Xiang 1,2 , WANG Anjie 1,2,* , MA Xuehu 2 1 State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116012, Liaoning, China 2 Liaoning Key Laboratory of Petrochemical Technology and Equipments, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116012, Liaoning, China Abstract: MoO 3 -CeO 2 -SiO 2 mixed oxides were prepared by the sol-gel method. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The catalyst activity for the oxidative desulfurization of dibenzothiophene (DBT) with cumene hydroperoxide as the oxidant in toluene was investigated at 40 o C and atmospheric pressure. The optimum Mo/Si and Ce/Si molar ratios were 0.1 and 0.02, respectively. Crystalline MoO 3 was observed in the MoO 3 -CeO 2 -SiO 2 catalysts. The introduction of CeO 2 promoted the high dispersion of MoO 3 over SiO 2 . Mo 6+ was the predominant species in MoO 3 /SiO 2 , and Mo 5+ species appeared after the introduction of CeO 2 . The presence of Mo 5+ may be responsible for the good performance of MoO 3 -CeO 2 -SiO 2 in the oxidative desulfurization of DBT. Key words: molybdenum oxide; cerium oxide; silica; sol-gel method; dibenzothiophene; oxidative desulfurization In recent years, regulations on the sulfur levels in liquid fuels have become stricter due to environmental concerns. The most common method employed by the refinery industry for the removal of sulfur from fuels is hydrodesulfurization (HDS). The HDS reactivity of sulfur-containing compounds in liquid fuels varies over a wide range, and the compounds present in diesel fuels after HDS are mainly dibenzothiophene (DBT) and its alkylated derivatives (DBTs). To remove these refractory sulfur-containing compounds, HDS must be carried out under severe conditions, which require high hydrogen and energy consumption. Thus, several non-hydrodesulfurization tech- nologies such as selective adsorption [1,2], extraction [3], oxidation [4–6], and bioprocesses [7] have received much attention because of their mild reaction conditions and high efficiency to remove DBT and DBTs. Oxidative desulfurization (ODS) is chemically comple- mentary to HDS. DBT and DBTs, the most refractory sul- fur-containing compounds in HDS, are easily converted by oxidation because they all possess high electron densities [8]. Therefore, a combination of HDS-ODS can be a cost-effective way to achieve an ultra-low level of sulfur. Two types of oxi- dants are widely used in the ODS process: water-soluble oxi- dants, e.g., hydrogen peroxide [9–12], and oil-soluble oxidants, e.g., tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) [8,13]. Because a wa- ter-soluble oxidant is immiscible with hydrophobic petroleum feedstocks, the interphase mass transfer will be the rate-controlling step when it is used [14]. In addition, the con- tamination of the oil and water is not avoidable because the water-soluble organic compounds (e.g., the oxygen-containing compounds) in petroleum feedstocks can dissolve in water and trace amounts of water are present in the oil phase. On the other hand, the use of oil-soluble oxidants would improve the reac- tion efficiency and make it possible to carry out the reaction in a continuous flow reactor due to their miscibility with oil. Wang et al. [8,13] reported that supported MoO 3 catalysts exhibited high ODS activity with TBHP as the oxidant. How- ever, our previous work indicated that supported MoO 3 cata- lysts deactivated rapidly because of the loss of the active MoO 3 phase. In the present work, a MoO 3 -SiO 2 mixed oxide was prepared by the sol-gel method, and CeO 2 was introduced as the promoter. Both the ODS activity and catalyst stability were significantly improved. ZHANG Jian et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(10): 1017–1021 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst Preparation Tetraethylorthosilicate (8 ml, Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., AR grade) was mixed with 8 ml ethanol under stirring, and the pH was adjusted to 1.0 by dropwise adding 3 ml HNO 3 (16 mol/L) to form solution A. Solution B was prepared by dissolving (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 ·4H 2 O (0.0681– 1.356 g, Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., AR grade) in 15 ml deionized water. Solution B was then added dropwise into solution A under stirring at 40 o C, followed by aging at 25 o C for 24 h, drying at 100 o C for 4 h, and calcination at 500 o C for 5 h. The yellow solids obtained were denoted Mo x Si, where x represented the Mo/Si molar ratio. The CeO 2 -promoted MoO 3 -SiO 2 mixed oxides were prepared by the same proce- dure except that 0.333–1.675 g Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O (Tianjin Ker- mel Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., AR grade) was dissolved together with 0.678 g (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 ·4H 2 O to give solution B. The catalysts were denoted Mo 0.1 Ce y Si, where y represented the Ce/Si molar ratio. For comparison, a SiO 2 -supported MoO 3 was prepared by impregnating 1 g SiO 2 with an aqueous solution of (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 ·4H 2 O for 8 h at room temperature, followed by drying at 100 qC for 4 h and calcination in air at 500 o C for 5 h. The catalyst was denoted MoO 3 /SiO 2 . The loading of MoO 3 was 20%. 1.2 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared catalysts were recorded on a Rigaku D/max-2400 diffractometer with nickel-filtered Cu K . radiation ( = 0.154 nm) at 40 kV and 20 mA. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements were per- formed using a Micromeritics-2010 adsorption analyzer. The BET surface areas of the samples were determined from their N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) of the samples were recorded using a FT-IR 800 spectrometer. The valencies of the surface Mo species were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Thermo ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectrometer, Mg K . source). A pass energy of 20 eV was used. All binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. The MoO 3 con- tents of MoO 3 /SiO 2 and Mo 0.1 Si before and after the ODS reaction were measured with an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer (ICP, Optima 2000DV). 1.3 DBT oxidation The oxidation of DBT was performed in a fixed-bed glass reactor (8 mm i.d.). Catalyst samples were pelleted and then crushed and screened to 180 �200 mesh. A 0.2 g catalyst was charged for each run. The ODS activity of the prepared cata- lysts was evaluated with 0.1% DBT in toluene (sulfur content = 154 g/ml) as the model fuel and an oil-soluble oxidant, cu- mene hydroperoxide (CHP). The model fuel and CHP solution was fed into the reactor at the reaction temperature by a high pressure metering pump. The oxidation conditions were: at- mospheric pressure, WHSV = 32 h –1 , O/S molar ratio = 3, reaction temperature = 40 o C. Both feed and product were analyzed by an Agilent 6890 + Plus gas chromatograph equipped with an FID using a HP-5 capillary column and N 2 as the carrier gas. The heating program was as follow: holding at 120 o C for 5 min, then heating from 120 to 260 o C at 10 o C/min, and finally holding at 260 o C for 3 min. The product was quantified by the internal standard method using biphenyl as the internal standard. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Characterization results The XRD patterns of the Mo x Si samples with different Mo/Si molar ratios (x = 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) are shown in Fig. 1. Strong reflections at 2 T = 23 o , 25 o , 27 o , 33 o , 38 o , 46 o , and 49 o assigned to MoO 3 were observed for Mo 0.1 Si and Mo 0.2 Si [15]. However, these peaks were not found in the XRD patterns of Mo 0.01 Si and Mo 0.05 Si. This result suggested that MoO 3 was well dispersed in the catalyst with a low MoO 3 loading, whereas crystalline MoO 3 species appeared at Mo/Si molar ratios higher than 0.1. Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of the Mo 0.1 Si and Mo 0.1 Ce y Si samples with different Ce/Si molar ratios (y = 0.01, 0.02, 0.1). The strong diffraction peaks at 2 = 28 o , 33 o , 48 o , and 56 o observed in the XRD pattern of Mo 0.1 Ce 0.1 Si were assigned to CeO 2 . On the other hand, peaks assigned to MoO 3 were found in the patterns of the Mo 0.1 Si, Mo 0.1 Ce 0.01 Si, and Mo 0.1 Ce 0.02 Si samples, and their intensities decreased with increasing Ce/Si molar ratio. No peak due to CeO 2 was de- 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 2 T ( o ) MoO 3 In te n s ity (2) (3) (4) (1) Fig. 1. XRD patterns of the Mo x Si catalysts.

ZHANG Jian et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(10): 1017–1021 tected for the samples with Ce/Si molar ratios less than 0.02. For Mo 0.1 Ce 0.1 Si, the peaks from MoO 3 were too weak to be detected, whereas the peaks assigned to CeO 2 appeared, sug- gesting that crystalline CeO 2 species were formed at the high Ce/Si molar ratio. In summary, it can be concluded from Fig. 2 that at Mo/Si = 0.1 and Ce/Si � 0.02, the dispersion of MoO 3 was enhanced by the addition of CeO 2 , whereas in the cases of Mo/Si = 0.1 and Ce/Si > 0.02, crystalline CeO 2 was formed. Figure 3 illustrates the FT-IR spectra of Mo 0.1 Si, Mo 0.1 Ce 0.02 Si and SiO 2 . Both Mo 0.1 Si and Mo 0.1 Ce 0.02 Si showed peaks at 1 231, 1 083, 950, 800, and 455 cm –1 . The peaks at 1 231, 1 083, 800, and 455 cm –1 were the same as those of the SiO 2 sample. In the FT-IR spectrum of SiO 2 , the strong broad absorption peak at 1 083 cm –1 was due to the dissymmetry stretching vibration of Si–O–Si, whereas the band at 970 cm –1 was assigned to the vibration of Si–OH, and the bands at 800 and 455 cm 1 were due to the symmetry stretching vibration of Si–O–Si. In the spectra of Mo 0.1 Si and Mo 0.1 Ce 0.02 Si, the peak at 915 cm –1 can be attributed to the vibration of Mo–O–Si, and the vibration of Si–OH at 970 cm –1 was shifted to 950 cm 1 due to the influence of Mo–O–Si groups [17], which suggested that a strong interaction exists between MoO 3 and SiO 2 in the Mo 0.1 Si and Mo 0.1 Ce 0.02 Si catalysts. The XPS spectra of the Mo 0.1 Si and Mo 0.1 Ce 0.02 Si samples are shown in Fig. 4. The two bands at 236 and 233 eV in the spectrum of Mo 0.1 Si were assigned to the binding energies of Mo 3d 3/2 and Mo 3d 5/2 [18,19]. Compared with the Mo 0.1 Si catalyst, an overlap of the two bands was observed for Mo 0.1 Ce 0.02 Si. This can be the result of a strong electronic interaction between the CeO 2 and MoO 3 species, leading to the formation of a small amount of low valence Mo 5+ species [20]. 2.2 ODS activity 2.2.1 Effect of catalyst preparation methods Figure 5 shows the DBT conversion as a function of reaction time over the Mo 0.1 Si and MoO 3 /SiO 2 samples. The loading of MoO 3 in Mo 0.1 Si was 19.4%. As shown in Fig. 5, the catalyst prepared by the sol-gel method showed a higher ODS activity than that obtained by the impregnation method. The conversion of DBT over Mo 0.1 Si reached 91% and was constant over 8 h. However, the DBT conversion over MoO 3 /SiO 2 decreased from 86% to 62% in 8 h, which indicated that the ODS activity of MoO 3 /SiO 2 decreased rapidly with increasing reaction time. The surface areas of Mo 0.1 Si and MoO 3 /SiO 2 were 141 and 345 m 2 /g, respectively. Although Mo 0.1 Si had a lower surface area, it showed a much higher activity and stability in DBT oxidation than MoO 3 /SiO 2 , which indicated that the surface area was not the key parameter that determined the catalytic performance of the catalysts. On the other hand, the ICP results revealed that a 60.5% loss of MoO 3 for MoO 3 /SiO 2 occurred after 8 h reaction. In contrast, the value was only 31.9% for Mo 0.1 Si. The severe loss of the active component from MoO 3 /SiO 2 can be the result 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 In te n s ity (4) (3) (2) 2 T /( o ) (1) MoO 3 CeO 2 Fig. 2.

ZHANG Jian et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(10): 1017–1021 of the weak interactions between MoO 3 and SiO 2 in the catalyst prepared by the impregnation method. This significantly af- fected the stability of MoO 3 /SiO 2 . 2.2.2 Effect of Mo/Si molar ratio Figure 6 shows the changes of DBT conversion with reac- tion time over the Mo x Si catalysts. The ODS activity of Mo x Si first increased with the Mo/Si molar ratio and reached the maximum at x = 0.1. Upon further increasing the Mo/Si molar ratio, both the ODS activity and stability of Mo x Si decreased. Combined with the XRD results (Fig. 1), this suggested that at x < 0.1, the number of active sites in Mo x Si increased with the Mo/Si molar ratio, which gave the increase in DBT conversion. At x > 0.1, there may be segregation of MoO 3 , which would result in decreased dispersion of MoO 3 and/or the activity of the individual active site, and thus the lower overall ODS activity of Mo x Si. 2.2.3 Effect of Ce/Si molar ratio DBT conversion with reaction time over Mo 0.1 Ce y Si and Mo 0.1 Si is shown in Fig. 7. The results indicated that the ODS activity of Mo 0.1 Si was enhanced by the addition of a proper amount of CeO 2 , and the optimum Ce/Si molar ratio was 0.02. Compared with Mo 0.1 Si, the DBT conversion over Mo 0.1 Ce 0.02 - Si was increased from 92% to 97%. As suggested by the XRD and XPS data (Figs. 2 and 4), the addition of CeO 2 promoted the dispersion of MoO 3 and the formation of Mo 5+ species by electronic interactions with Mo species, and hence the en- hanced ODS activity of Mo 0.1 Ce 0.01 Si and Mo 0.1 Ce 0.02 Si. Nev- ertheless, at high Ce/Si molar ratios, both the activity and stability of the CeO 2 -containing catalyst decreased (Mo 0.1 Ce 0.1 - Si in Fig. 7). On the basis of the XRD results (Fig. 2), the formation of crystalline CeO 2 and consequently the coverage of the surface active sites would account for the low ODS per- formance of the catalysts with a high CeO 2 content. 3 Conclusions MoO 3 -CeO 2 -SiO 2 mixed oxides with high ODS activity and stability were prepared by a sol-gel method. The MoO 3 inter- acted strongly with SiO 2 in MoO 3 -SiO 2 , which significantly inhibited the loss of the active catalytic component and en- hanced the stability of MoO 3 -SiO 2 . The ODS activity of MoO 3 -SiO 2 was further improved by the introduction of a proper amount of CeO 2 . The addition of CeO 2 promoted the dispersion of MoO 3 , and small amounts of Mo 5+ may have been formed due to electronic interactions between Ce and Mo species. For the MoO 3 -CeO 2 -SiO 2 mixed oxide catalyst, the optimum Mo/Si and Ce/Si molar ratios were 0.1 and 0.02, respectively. The formation of crystalline CeO 2 and conse- quently the coverage of the surface active sits can account for the low ODS performance of the catalysts with a high CeO 2 content. 12345678 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 D B T c onver s i on ( % ) Time (h) (1) (2) Fig. 5.

Tel: +86-411-39893693; Fax: +86-411-39893693 MoO3-CeO2-SiO2 mixed oxides were prepared by the sol-gel method. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The catalyst activity for the oxidative desulfurization of dibenzothiophene (DBT) with cumene hydroperoxide as the oxidant in toluene was investigated at 40 °C and atmospheric pressure. The optimum Mo/Si and Ce/Si molar ratios were 0.1 and 0.02, respectively. Crystalline MoO3 was observed in the MoO3-CeO2-SiO2 catalysts. The introduction of CeO2 promoted the high dispersion of MoO3 over SiO2. Mo6+ was the predominant species in MoO3/SiO2, and Mo5+ species appeared after the introduction of CeO2. The presence of Mo5+ may be responsible for the good performance of MoO3-CeO2-SiO2 in the oxidative desulfurization of DBT.
