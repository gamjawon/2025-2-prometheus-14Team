Introduction Silica-supported copper catalysts show good activ- ity in several catalytic reactions such as steam reform- ing, water-gas shift, ester hydrogenolysis, liquid phase hydrolysis, and oxidation of CO and hydrocar- bons, so these catalysts have been studied extensively. Chromium oxide and molybdenum oxide are widely used in catalysts as promoters, either as electronic promoters or structural promoters in different catalytic systems. Aniline is an important raw material and intermedi- ate for the production of dye, medicine, agriculture pesticides and rubber chemicals. In chemical industry, *Corresponding author. Tel.: +86 791 8305436; fax: +86 791 8333708; e-mail: xmfang@ncu.edu.cn we can synthesize more than 300 kinds of very important chemicals with aniline. There are four main methods in industry for the manufacture of aniline, such as, the reduction of nitrobenzene by iron powder, chlorobenzene catalytic ammoniation, nitrobenzene catalytic hydrogenation and phenol catalytic ammo- niation. Due to the high cost and high corrosiveness, the technology of phenol catalytic ammoniation has no longer been applied. Gas-phase catalytic hydro- genation of nitrobenzene is a principal industrial method for preparation of aniline. There are various kinds of catalysts used in aniline manufacture, where copper catalysts supported on kieselguhr was most commonly applied. In a number of cases, they are promoted by various additives, such as magnesium, calcium, zirconium, thorium, vanadium or chromium [1,2]. At present, Cu/SiO2 catalyst is in widely use in 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII $0926-860X(97)0003 8-0 130 X. Fang et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 129-135 nitrobenzene hydrogenation. Under the conditions of industry, the process proceeds over Cu/SiO2 catalyst which is exposed to a comparatively fast deactivation. In view of this, an increase of activity and stability of catalyst to improve the catalytic performance is vital. Experimental data indicates that the catalyst deactiva- tion in the catalytic system of gas-phase hydrogena- tion of nitrobenzene is caused by surface blocking by coke, the sintering of active Cu particles and the poisoning of organic sulfide to Cu. In commercial process, when the content of nitrobenzene in produc- tion is higher than 1 wt%, the catalyst has to be regenerated. So far, studies on the deactivation and regeneration of copper catalysts for nitrobenzene hydrogenation to aniline have been published [3,4]. However, this pro- blem is of certain practical interest because the com- mon industrial catalysts work for 10-15 days to 3-4 months, after that they must be regenerated. In this paper Cu-Cr-Mo/SiO2 nitrobenzene catalyst is pre- sented and it is found that its properties are much better than those of the industrial Cu/SiO2 catalyst. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The large pore silica-gel sphere (LUMP TS-1, ~b0.5-0.125 mm particle size, SBET=280 mZ/g) was subsidized by Tsingtao Haiyang Chemical Group, China; the cupric nitrate (AR, HG3-391-75) was supplied by the Fourth Shanghai Chemical Reagent Factory, China; the ammonium molybdate (AR, GB657-79) was supplied by Shanghai Gel Chemical Factory, China; and the ammonium dichromate (AR, GB656-77) and the nitrobenzene (CP, HG3-963-76) were supplied by the First Shanghai Chemical Reagent Factory, China. A series of Cu-Cr-Mo/ SiO2 catalysts with different contents of Cr and Mo were prepared by impregnating the silica-gel with an aqueous solution of (NH4)2Cr207 and an aqueous solution of (NH4)6MoTO24.4H20 in one step with Cr 1~5 wt% and the content of Mo 1~5 wt%. The water was removed by evaporation and the dry pre- cursor was calcined at 773 K, then the Cr-Mo/SiO2 was impregnated with saturated cuprammonium solu- tion. The procedures were as follows: 10 g of silica was put in quantitative 0.5 M (NH4)2Cr207 aqueous solution and 0.5 M (NH4)2MoO4 aqueous solution; the suspension was dried at 363 K in water bath, then the obtained catalyst was further dried at 383 K for 4 h and then calcinated in an oven at 773 K for 4 h. The Cr-Mo/SiO2 was added to cuprammonium nitrate saturated solution. The surplus amount of Cu in solu- tion is determined by estimating volume of solution and analysis by titrimetry to let the contents of Cu on catalysts be among 12~18 wt%. After filtration, the product was washed by dilute ammonia solution (0.5 wt%), and dried at 383 K for 4 h. The dry pre- cursor was then calcined in air at 573 K for 4 h. As the same procedures mentioned above, we obtained Cu-Cr/SiO2 and Cu-Mo/SiO2 catalysts. 2.2. Reduction and catalytic reaction Commercial hydrogen (99 vol%) was employed as reductant and reaction gas with a heating rate of 5 K/rain controlled by a temperature programmer. All reactions were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor (stainless steel U-shaped tube, 4 mm inner diameter) under a flow of hydrogen and vapor-phase nitroben- zene was obtained by a vaporizer installed in front of reactor. The liquid nitrobenzene was admitted to the vaporizer by a cylinder pump, the error of the set flow- rate not exceeding 1%. The catalyst was held in the middle of the second arm, and the leading arm served as a preheater. 530 mg of catalyst sample was reduced in situ at 553 K for 4 h and then at 573 K for 2 h under a flow of 30 ml/min of hydrogen. The temperature lbr the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene (CP) was at 533 K. The molar ratio of H2/nitrobenzene was 4 (the WHSV of nitrobenzene was 4.0 h 1) and the total pressure was 0.1 MPa in the reactor. The reaction products were analyzed with a TCD gas chromatography (packed column, OV-101). The gas chromatography setting was as following: oven, T=343 K, injection, T=383 K; TCD detector, T=343 K. The reaction was stopped, when the content of nitrobenzene was higher than 1 wt%. 2.3. Catalyst characterization Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experi- ments were performed in TPR and TPD multifunc- tional apparatus. The samples (100 mg in a quartz X. Fang et al./Applied Catah'sis A.\" General 161 (1997) 129-135 131 reactor) were heated in a flow of nitrogen (99.99 vol%) (40 ml min-I) up to 573 K in order to remove the adsorbed water and other surface con- taminants, and then cooled to room temperature in nitrogen. Mixture of 10 vol% hydrogen (99.99 vol%) in nitrogen (40 ml min- 1 ) was then led into the reactor heated at a rate of 5 K min- i up to 593 K. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurements were performed by a VG ESCALAB MARk-II spec- trometer fitted with a hemispherical electron analyzer and a Mg anode X-ray exciting source (MgK(r=1253 eV, 1 eV=l.602x 10-19 J). The pow- der samples were mounted on a sample rod placed in a pretreatment chamber and reduced in situ by hydrogen at 573 K. The residual pressure in the analysts cham- ber was below 1 10 ~ Pa. The spectra were collected for 20-90 rain, depending on the peak intensities, at a pass energy of 20 eV, which is typical of high resolu- tion conditions. All binding energies (BEs) were referred to the adventitious C~ line at 284.9 eV. This reference gave BE values within an accuracy of =:0.2 eV. Species on Cu was recorded by the Auger spectra. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the reduced catalysts were recorded by using Rigaku Rotaflex-D/ max-C diffractometer and nickel-filtered CuKc~ radia- tion IA=0,1538nm), under constant instrumental parameters. For each sample, Bragg angles between 30 and 60~ were scanned at a rate of 2rain. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. The effects qf O; Mo on the catalytic stability of Cu-Cr-Mo/Sio2 far less than that used in industry (from 20:1 to 50 : 1 ). Table 1 shows that the hydrogenation property of Cu-Cr-Mo/SiO2 is remarkably better than that of commercial Cu/SiO2 catalyst. The aniline production capacity of catalyst Cu-Cr203/SiO2 and Cu-MoO3 is better than commercial Cu/SiO2 catalyst. Though the content of Cr and Mo-oxide is high in catalysts C and D, the aniline production capacity of catalysts C and D is only 50% higher than that of Cu/SiO2 and the aniline production capacity of catalysts E and F is 170% higher than that of Cu/SiO2. Table 1 indicates that suitable content of Cr, Mo-oxide in Cu/SiO2 can increase the aniline production capacity of catalysts. Comparison the aniline production capacity between catalysts A, B and C, in Table I also shows that the effect between Cr and Cu is stronger than that between Mo and Cu. As what has been established [5], it is reasonable to assume that it is a precursor of coking of nitrobenzene that strongly decreases the stability of catalysts. The deactivation of catalyst applied in industries is mainly caused by carbon deposits and sintering of Cu. Dvorak et al. [61 have found that 1,3- dinitrobenzene, concomitant with the starting nitro- benzene, deactivates the catalyst notably higher than nitrobenzene. In our experiment, the feed of nitroben- zene content 1,3-nitrobenzene was 3 ppm and thio- phene was 5 ppm. The contribution of catalytic poisons by sulfur cannot be neglected. Stefanescu et al. [71 have found that the Cr203 in CuO-Cr203 systems for propene hydrogenation to propane can increase CuO content-hydrogenation activity and H2 dissociative adsorption on Cu. The promoter of Cr- oxide in Cu-Cr-Mo/SiOe catalysts can increase He dissociative adsorption on Cu and decrease the carbon deposition, the stability of catalysts can bc improved. The catalysts Cu-Cr/SiO2, Cu-Mo/SiO2 and a series of Cu-Cr-Mo]SiO2 catalysts were studied in a fixed-bad reactor. The results of a few typical Cu-Cr-Mo/SiO2 catalysts and the commercial Cu/SiO2 catalyst (supplied by Jiujiang Chemical Factory, Jiangxi, China) are listed in Table 1. In order to obtain the results of catalytic stability of catalysts in short time, the experiments were con- ducted at nitrobenzene WHSV values was 4.0 h-~. These values are 10 times higher than those used with the best industrial catalysts. The feed molar ratio between hydrogen and nitrobenzene was 4 which is 3.2. The su,rface species on catah'sts The Auger spectra of Cu and the XPS of Cr, Mo on catalysts reduced at 573 K are displayed in Figs. I, 2 and Fig. 3, respectively. From the Auger spectra of Cu in Fig. 1, we can find that there is a little amount of Cu20 and CuO, and the binding energy of Cu is decreased by 0.74 eV after adding promoter of Cr and Mo. From the XPS of Cr and Mo in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, it can be seen that the electron binding energies of Cr and Mo supported on catalysts are higher than those on SiO2, increased by 132 X.

XPS curves of Mo on catalysts. 1.5 eV for Cr 2p3/2 and 0.60 eV for Mo 3d5/2, respec- tively. This indicates that Cr and Mo have the tendency to give electrons to Cu. In industrial process for vapor- phase hydrogenation of PhNO2, a little amount of CuO always exists in Cu catalysts [8]. Due to the formation of CuO-Cr203 in calcination at 773 K [9], the electron binding energy of Cr3/2 on Cu--Cr/SiO2 or Cu-Cr-Mo/ SiO2 is increased. From the figure it can also be noted that there are two kinds of species of molybdenum oxide: MoO3 and MoO2. Comparison of the electron BEs of Mo 3d5/2 in MoO3/SiO2 and Cu-MoO3/SiO2, in Fig. 3 also indicates that the influence of MoO3 on catalytic properties of Cu/SiO2 catalysts is less than that of Cr203. At low Mo loading and under dehy- drated conditions, the dispersed surface molybdenum oxide species have either the hexacoordinated mono- oxo structures concluded from Raman spectroscopy [10] or the tetracoordinated dioxo structure concluded from luminescence [11,12]. Fu [13] thought that MoO3 supported on SiO2 is difficult to disperse, and its pattem relevant to its content. When the content of MoO3 in catalysts is below 2 wt%, it is easy to disperse on SiO2 and there is a little amount of tetrahedral Mo and octahedral Mo. Most of the MoO3 exists as highly dispersed bata- MoO3 crystal. When the content of MoO3 in catalysts is higher than 4 wt%, the dispersion of Mo will be quite low. Mo exists in undecomposed ammonium molybdate on catalysts, and there is no crystal-line MOO3. Our experiment (Fig. 3) shows that except for crystal-line MOO3, there is MoO2 species on catalysts. The hydrogenation activities may be correlated with the active sites [14]. Both the crystal-lines MoO3 and MoO2 are easy to combine with S to form stable MoS2 crystal [15], so the stability of catalysts can be increased. The stability test (Table 1 ) also reveals that the stability of catalysts containing low content of Mo is higher than that of catalysts having a higher content of Mo. This is due to the formation of species MoO2 and crystal MoO3 when a low content of Mo is added to the catalyst. 3.3. He-TPR studies The H2-TPR profiles are used to study the influ- ences of Cr and Mo on the active Cu particles. Under the conditions of experiments, Cr203 and MoO3 are not reduced by hydrogen. The TPR curves are given in Fig. 4. The H2-TPR curve of the Cu/SiO2 catalysts has two peaks: one caused by the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ at about 476 K, and the other by the reduction of CuO to Cuat about 532 K. The first peak is smaller compared with the second, which reveals that the concentration of Cue+ on catalysts is low. The second peak is wider, which implies that there are different forms of CuO species on the catalysts. The reduction peak of Cu+ to Cunormally appears at around 673 K [16], because the reduced temperature in our experiments is below 673 K, the reduction peak of Cu+ to Cudoes not appear in TPR profiles. The H2-TPR curve of Cu-Cr- Mo/SiO2 catalyst has two similar peaks, but they have shifted to lower temperatures (dropping about 11 K). This reveals that promoters Cr203 and MoO~ have effects of electron donor and promote dispersion of CuO particles. It has been observed that the nature of the surface copper species depends on the copper loading and 134 X. Fang et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 129-135 532 \"~I 473 523 5?3 Fig. 4. The temperature programmed reduction profiles of catalysts. I: cutsgh II: Calaly~t F calcination temperature [ 17,18]. Kohler et al. [ 19,20] have reported that with the increasing copper loading on silica, larger copper crystallites are found in load- ing above 6 wt%. In comparison with alumina, the dispersion of copper on silica is much lower [21]. We also find that the procedure and methods for the preparation of catalysts can influence the uniformity of CuO dispersion on SiO2. In the preparation of catalysts, there are two different mechanisms of cop- per deposition: (i) ion exchange of [Cu(NH3)4]2+ ions with pairs of silanol groups on the silica surface to form a well-dispersed network of single CuZ+-diamine ions attached to the silica surface, and (ii) precipitation of Cu2+ as copper hydroxide from the solution. When catalysts are prepared by impregnation of copper on silica in an amount exceeding saturation by the ion- exchange method, a large amount of CuO would form in the calcination of catalysts at 773 K. Kobayashi and his co-workers [22] pointed out that there are isolated CuO particle and accumulated CuO cluster according to the UVR spectra of Cu/SiO2, so it is reasonable to assign the second reduction peak to two dispersion state CuO. We assign that the first reduction peak to accumulated Cu2+ cluster, and the second reduction peak to accumulated CuO and isolated CuO clusters. Geoffery [23] and Yang [24] found that Cu2+ is reduced by hydrogen in two steps from TPR profiles of CuC12 and CuO supported on SiO2. From the Auger spectra of catalyst reduced at 573 K (Fig. 1), we can see that the existence of Cu20 phase, which illustrates that there is one step in catalyst hydrogenation: from Cue+ to Cu+. Since the promoters Cr203 and MoO3 have electron donor effect, the addition of Cr203 and MoO3 in the catalysts can promote the formation of Cu+ and the reduction of CuO into Cu The Cu particle on catalysts is not easy to combine with electronegative S2- ion, therefore the promoters added in catalyst can improve the stability to sulfur poisoning. 3.4. The influences of Cre03 and MoO3 on the dispersity of Cu XRD experiments show that all of the unreduced catalysts are amorphous and the reduced catalysts gives poorly crystalline copper-containing phase on catalysts. The XRD patterns of reduced samples are displayed in Fig. 5. It can be observed that the Cu diffraction peak of Cu-Cr-Mo/SiO2 is much wider than that of Cu/SiO2, which then indicates that the promoters Cr and Mo added in catalysts can improve the dispersion of Cu particles, and retard sintering of active Cu particles, therefore the stability of catalysts can be improved greatly. Due to calcination at 773 K, a little amount of CuO.Cr203 is formed on catalysts, Cu chromite also can improve the stability of CuO, Cu and preclude sintering of active particles. In studying the Cu-Cr/ SiO2 catalyst, Xiu [25] showed that the addition of Cr in catalyst can restrain the sintering effectively, result- X.

Our result supports the general belief that chromiun oxide is a structural promoter which retards sintering of copper by thermal effects. 4. Conclusions Cr203 and MoO3 have electron donor effect on Cu particles, and thus can promote the reduction of Cu species. A proper content of Cr203 and MoO3 added in catalysts can increase the dispersion of Cu, and restrain the sintering of active Cu particles and the carbon deposits on catalysts. Therefore, adding of Cr20~ and MoO~ in the Cu/SiO3 catalyst can increase the stability of catalyst remarkably.

Tel.: +86 791 8305436; fax: +86 791 8333708 The effect on the life time behavior of nitrobenzene hydrogenation of the addition of Cr and Mo-oxide to a Cu/SiO2 catalysts was studied in a fixed-bed flow reactor and the results were analyzed in terms of change of the surface species studied by Auger and XPS spectroscopes, change of reducibility behavior was studied by H2-TPR and change in the crystalline phases was studied by XRD. The results indicate that the stability of catalysts modified by Cr- and Mo-oxide is improved remarkably; the Cr2O3 as well as the MoO3 in catalysts has the effect of electron donor to Cu; and proper contents of Cr, Mo in catalysts can increase the dispersity of Cu particles.
