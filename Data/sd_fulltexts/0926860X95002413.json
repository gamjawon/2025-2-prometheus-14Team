I-Iillerovfi, M. Zdra~il * Institute of Chemical Process Fundamentals, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Rozvojovd 135, 165 02 Prague 6 - Suchdol, Czech Republic Received 28 November 1994; revised 22 September 1995; accepted 25 September 1995 Abstract The MoO3/alumina and Mo/active carbon catalysts of various loadings were prepared by the new slurry impregnation method (SIM). The slurry of MoO3 in water was added to the support. The pH of the slurry was 2.6 and this was favourable for the adsorption of molybdate anions on alumina and active carbon with the point of zero charge 7.0 and 7.5, respectively. The low solubility of MoO3 was sufficient to transport molybdenum species from solid MoO3 to the adsorbed phase. The equilibrium was achieved after 5 weeks at 30-50. The calcination was not necessary and was left out. This was especially advantageous for active carbon support which is susceptible to oxidative damage. The maximum loading achieved was 18 and 31 wt.-% MoO3 for Al203 (195 m2 g-~) and active carbon (1100 m2 g-~), respectively. The activity was tested in the hydrodesulfurization of thiophene at 1.6 MPa and 250-400. The activity of the SIM samples was similar to the activity of the catalysts prepared by the conventional impregnation method (CIM) with ammonium heptamolybdate. The dependence of the activity on loading for the SIM samples was the same as reported in the literature for CIM catalysts. On alumina the activity per unit of molybdena was constant in the whole range of the loading 0-18 wt.-% MoO3. On active carbon it gradually decreased in the Whole range of the loading from 0 to 31 wt.-% MoO3. It is concluded that the nature of the SIM catalysts is the same as of the CIM catalysts but the SIM possesses several advantages.

Zdra~il /Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 13-26 l. Introduction Molybdenum based supported catalysts in oxidic, reduced, or sulfidic forms possess activity for many reactions. The common precursor of these catalysts is supported MoO3. The hydrotreating over sulfide catalysts belongs to the most important applications of molybdenum catalysts. The usual support of the industrial catalysts is alumina. However, carbon supported sulfide catalysts are also intensively studied recently because they exhibit interesting catalytic properties [1,2]. The most widely used preparation of the molybdenum catalysts is aqueous impregnation of the support with ammonium heptamolybdate [3-5]. However, a number of alternative methods have been described: adsorbing MoO2(OH)2 from the gas phase [6], gas phase adsorption of Mo(CO)6 [7], thermal spreading of MoO3 [4,8], adsorption of metal complexes [9], thermal spreading of MoS2 [10], impregnation with molybdenum sulfur cluster compounds [11], homoge- neous precipitation of MoS2 on alumina [12], etc. We have recently described a new procedure named slurry impregnation method with the acronym SIM [13,14]. Alumina or active carbon support is mixed with a slurry of required amount of MoO3 in water. After some time (depending on the temperature and the size of the support particles) all powder of the solid MoO3 disappears. The low solubility of MoO3 is sufficient to transport molybdenum species from solid MoO3 via the solution to the sup- ported phase. All deposited species are adsorbed. The precipitation of molyb- dena species in pores during drying is negligible because the concentration of the solution is very low at the end of the impregnation. Another advantage of the SIM method over the conventional impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate concerns calcination. Calcination is applied in conventional impregnation to decompose ammonium heptamolybdate and to remove ammonia from the catalyst. In the slurry impregnation method the calcination is not necessary because no other chemicals beside MoO3 and water are used. Evolution of nitrogenous gases formed from ammonium heptamolyb- date is thus avoided. Carbon supported molybdenum catalysts cannot be calcined in air because the carrier is susceptible to oxidative damage. That is the reason why the carbon supported ammonium heptamolybdate is often decomposed during in situ sulfi- dation in the catalytic reactor (e.g. [15-20]). The disadvantage is that ammo- nium sulfide is released which can cause plugging problems in downstream parts of the apparatus. With the SIM samples, calcination is left out and only water is produced during in situ sulfidation. The previous papers described the SIM preparation of MoO3/A1203 [13] and MoO3/C [14] catalysts with usual loadings of about 15 wt.-% MoO3. The deposition of MoO3 was achieved by refluxing the mixture for several hours and E. Hillerov6, M. Zdra~il / Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 13-26 15 the pH of the slurry was not measured. The purpose of the present paper was to test milder conditions (five weeks at 30-50), to determine the maximum achievable loading of alumina and active carbon, and to investigate pH changes of the slurry during impregnation. The activity was tested in the hydrodesulfur- ization of thiophene. The dependence of the activity on loading of the catalysts prepared by SIM using MoO3 was compared with the dependence reported in literature for the catalysts prepared by the conventional impregnation using (NH4)6MOTO24. 2. Experimental 2.1. Supports Alumina (A1) T-A1203 Norton 6173 (Norton Chemical Process Products, UK) had BET area of 195 m2 g-t and pore volume 0.59 cm3 g-l (mercury porosimetry). The extrudates were crushed to the particle size of 0.16-0.32 mm. Active carbon (C) GA-1 (Slovensk6 lu~obn6 z~vody, Slovak Republic) had BET surface area of 1100 m2 g- 1, volume of micropores 0.35 m3 g- 1 (nitrogen adsorption) and pore volume 0.73 cm3 g-l (mercury porosimetry). The extru- dates were crushed to the particle size of 0.16-0.32 mm. They were intensively washed with hot distilled water (50 1 of water per 100 g of carbon) and dried before use. 2.2.

The cata- lysts are named accordingly: SIM-15MoO3/AI is the catalyst with the nominal content 15 wt.-% MoO3 and 85 wt.-% A1203, and prepared by the slurry impregnation method. The nominal content of MoO3 corresponds to the amount of MoO3 or MoO3 in the form of (NHn)6Mo7024 used in the preparation of the catalyst. In the preparation of CIM catalysts and low- and medium-loaded SIM catalysts, all (NHa)6MOTO24 or MoO3 used in the preparation was in fact deposited. In the preparation of SIM catalysts with the highest loading, part of the MoO3 was not deposited and remained in the form of slurry; the achieved loading was lower than the nominal loading. The procedure used to determine the deposited amount of MoO3 is described henceforward and the actually achieved loadings are shown in Tables 1 and 2. 2.2.1. CIM-IO.3MoO3/Al The solution of (NH4)6MOTO24 \" 4H20 (1.41 g) in water (10 ml) was mixed with alumina support (10 g) and it was left standing overnight at room temperature. It was dried in a rotary vacuum evaporator and calcined in a flow of air. The temperature was linearly increased to 400 during 1 h and then kept at 400 for 1 h. 2.2.2. CIM-12.4MoO3 / C The solution of (NH4)6Mo7024 \" 4H20 (1.73 g) in water (10 ml) was mixed with the active carbon (10 g). After standing at 95 for 1 h it was dried in a rotary vacuum evaporator. The catalyst was not calcined. 2.2.3. SIM catalysts MoO3 (Fluka, p.a.) was ground in an agate mortar. The mixture of the appropriate amount of MoO3, 20 ml of water and 1 g of support were prepared E. Hillerov6, M. Zdra[il/Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 13-26 17 in a set of flasks. For instance, the flask of the SIM-24MoO3/C sample contained 0.316 g MoO3, 1 g of carbon and 20 ml of water. The closed flasks were left standing for 5 weeks at 30-50 (on the grate above the central heating radiators) with occasional shaking about five times per day. The pH was measured with a combined glass electrode at room temperature. The fine powder of MoO3 disappeared after five weeks; the originally turbid liquid surrounding support particles became almost clear. However, with the samples of the highest nominal content of MoO3, saturation of the support was reached, a part of MoO3 was not deposited and remained as fine powder in the turbid liquid. The support was separated from the clear or turbid liquid by decantation. It was dried in a rotary vacuum evaporator and was not calcined. The amount of MoO3 in the remaining clear or turbid liquid in each flask was determined. Concentrated NH 4OH (1 ml) was added and it was slowly heated to 100 and left standing for 30 min to dissolve MoO3. The solution was filtered and molybdenum was determined by atomic absorption. The commercial catalyst MoO3/A1203, BASF M 8-30 containing 15% MoO3 was also included for the comparison of activity. It was ground to particles of 0.16-0.32 mm. 2.3. Catalytic activity The model reaction was hydrodesulfurization of thiophene (TH). Integral conversions were obtained in a fixed bed flow reactor (I.D. 2.5 mm). The pressure was 1.6 MPa, the initial partial pressure of TH 40 kPa, the feed rate F(TH) 0.6 mmol h-l, and the hydrogen flow 1.5 mol h- 1. The catalyst charge W was 0.01 g and it was diluted with 0.03 g of inert low surface area a-alumina (8 m2 g-1). The catalyst was in situ presulfided with H2S/H2 mixture (1:10) at atmospheric pressure. The temperature was linearly increased in 1 h to 400 and kept at this value for 2 h. The feed was introduced at the pressure of 1.6 MPa and the conversion of TH, x(TH), was determined at several temperatures from 400 to 240, changing the temperature in steps of 20. The conversion was defined as x(TH)= (nTH)- n(TH))/nTH), where no and n are the initial and final number of moles, respectively. The conversions were in the range 0-0.85, depending on the catalyst and temperature. The test lasted about 9 h and no deactivation of the catalysts was observed. The reproducibility of the activity in terms of relative rate constants (see below) was better than + 10%. 3. Results and discussion 3.1.

Various impregnation methods (incipient wetness, with excess of the solution, etc.) lead to different ratio adsorbed/precipitated species. The highest portion of adsorbed species is achieved by equilibrium adsorption with filtration of the excess solution [4,21 ]. At a solution pH below the point of zero charge (PZC) of the support, the surface is positively charged and attracts molybdate anions from the impregna- tion solution of ammonium heptamolybdate (adsorption on alumina [6,22-26], adsorption on active carbon [17,27]). The PZC of aluminas and active carbons usually falls into the range 4-9. The natural pH of the ammonium molybdate solution is about 5.5 [28]. The solution has to be acidified (usually with nitric acid) to adjust the pH to the range 2-3 favourable for the adsorption. However, the concentrated ammonium heptamolybdate solutions precipitate when acidified [28], and precipitation can also be initiated by the addition of alumina [24]. The diluted solutions only have to be used for the equilibrium adsorption impregna- tion from solutions of ammonium heptamolybdate at low pH. This is illustrated in Table 3 showing low concentrations chosen by previous authors. High loadings were reported in Table 3 even when the solution concentrations were low. This demonstrates the high affinity of molybdenum anions to the surface at low pH. Molybdenum(VI) oxide is dissolved to molybdic acid with pKl 3.6 and pK2 4.1 at 25 [30]. The solubility of MoO3 is 0.21 g per 100 ml of water at 25 [31]. The pH of the slurry at 25 calculated from the saturated concentration and pK values is 2.6. This value has also been found experimentally (see below). The important advantage of the SIM over CIM is that the low natural pH of the molybdic acid saturated solution falls into the pH range 2-3 favourable for the adsorption of molybdate anions. The SIM mixture does not contain ammo- nium cations and no additive is necessary to adjust the low pH. E. Hillerov6, M. Zdra~il / Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 13-26 19 Molybdenum(VI) oxide has not been considered to be a suitable impregnation compound in the literature because of its low solubility. Its solubility is 0.13 and 1.08 g MoO3 per 100 ml of water at 20 and 60, respectively [31], while the values for ammonium heptamolybdate (expressed as MoO3) are 40 and 125 g, respectively [28]. However, the low solubility of MoO3 is only an illusory disadvantage. The concentrations of ammonium heptamolybdate solutions used in papers in Table 3 are similar to the solubility of MoO3. It is shown in the present work that high loadings of MoO3, comparable or even higher than those in Table 3, are achieved in SIM in the absence of ammonia (introduced in CIM as component of ammonium heptamolybdate) and added acid (introduced in CIM to adjust pH). 3.2. Molybdenum uptake Table 1 shows that the highest actual loading of alumina achieved with SIM was 18.1% MoO3. This corresponds to one molecule MoO3 occupying 0.21 nm2 of the surface. The area of one molecule of MoO3 at the surface of solid MoO3 calculated from its density by the method of Emmet and Teller is 0.154 nm2 [32]; this value defines the 'geometrical monolayer'. Previous authors concluded from various types of experiments that alumina is saturated with molybdena, or covered with 'saturation monolayer' (or with 'uppermost dispersion capacity monolayer'), at somewhat higher ratio of 0.17-0.25 nm2/MoO3 [6,33-37]. The above SIM value 0.21 nm2/MoO3 falls into this range and this suggests that the 'saturation monolayer' is achieved with SIM. It is seen in Table 2 that the highest actual loading of active carbon achieved with SIM was 31.2% MoO3. Using the ratio 0.21 nm2/MoO3, observed in the present work with alumina, the surface of the active carbon available to adsorption of MoO3 was calculated to be 380 m2 g- ~. It is almost twice higher than the area of typical industrial aluminas with an area of 200-250 m2 g-1. Other parts of the active carbon surface do not adsorb MoO3 for either geometrical (microporosity) of chemical reasons (chemical heterogeneity of the surface). However, the saturated SIM loading observed in the present work was higher than the highest loading reported in the literature for the conventional adsorption from ammonium heptamolybdate solution which was 27.3 and 24.3% MoO3 for active carbons of 1100 and 800 m2 g-~, respectively [27]. 3.3. pH of the slurry The pH of the slurries for the nominal contents 2, 4, 8, 15, 24, and 35% MoO3 were measured in blank experiments in the absence of the support, and the results are shown in Fig. 1. The values obtained after 48 h were 2.5-2.6 in good agreement with the value 2.6 calculated from pK1, pK2, and the solubility of molybdic acid. These values also correspond to the PZC 2.9 reported for 20 E. Hillerov~, M. Zdra~il / Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 13-26 pH 1 I '\"1 I .,~ I I i I I 0 0.2 0,4 0,6 w (Mo0s)' g Fig. I.

MoO3 in literature [37]. The slightly higher pH observed for the lowest nominal loading of 2% MoO3 was caused by too small an amount of MoO3 which was lower than required for the saturated solution. The data for blank experiments in Fig. 1 also illustrate that the dissolution of MoO3 is slow at the temperature used, 30-50. 1 h after the preparation of the MoO3-water slurries, the pH was higher than the equilibrium value observed after 48 h. The rate of the dissolution is proportional to the surface area of solid MoO3 present in the flask. This is the reason why the non-equilibrium values of pH measured after 1 h increased with decreasing amount of MoO3 in the flask. The pH of the MoO3-water-support slurries was measured 48 h and 5 weeks after their preparation and they are shown in Fig. 1. The equilibrium values after 5 weeks are determined by a combination of three factors. (i) The concentration of molybdic acid solution: the pH decreases from 7.0 to 2.6 as the concentration increases from zero to saturation. (ii) The ratio of solid MoO3 to A1203 or C in the slurry: the pH of the slurry of MoO3 alone is 2.6 and that of the present alumina and carbon 7.0 and 7.5, respectively; the pH of the mixtures is intermediate. (iii) The surface coverage of alumina or carbon with MOO3: the PZC of the supported MoO3/A1203 samples prepared by thermal spreading decreased from PZC of alumina at zero loading to PZC of MoO3 at 'saturation monolayer' loading [37]; the same trend was observed for MoO3/A1203 prepared by wet impregnation from ammonium heptamolybdate solution [38]. The data on MoO3//C are not available in the literature but a similar behaviour should be expected. E. Hillerov6, M. Zdra~il /Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 13-26 21 In the mixtures with the lowest nominal loading of 2% MoOa/A1203 and 2% MoO3//C, all MoO3 was dissolved and adsorbed, and the molybdic acid concentration in the solution was negligible. The surface loading was much lower than the 'saturation monolayer'. The pH was high and close to that of the slurry water-support alone, which was 7.0 and 7.5 for the present alumina and active carbon, respectively. In the mixtures with the highest nominal loading of 35% MoO3//A1203 and 35% MoO3//C, the support surface was covered by the 'saturation monolayer' and the solution was saturated with molybdic acid. The pH was low and close to that of the water-MoO3 slurry alone, which was 2.6. In the mixtures with the medium nominal loadings 4, 8, 15, and 24% MoOa/A1203 and /C, the situation was intermediate between the two above extremes. As the nominal loading increased, the support was more covered with molybdena and not all molybdic acid was adsorbed; the equilibrium pH de- creased. Fig. 1 also shows the pH values after 48 h when the slurries were far from equilibrium. These pH were similar to equilibrium values for MoO3//C samples but higher than the equilibrium values for MoO3/A1203 catalysts. The interpre- tation is difficult because of the complexity of the system. One possible reason might be the different kinetic situation. The rate determining step for A1203 seems to be the adsorption of anions; the molybdic acid solution is more concentrated (and acidic) after 48 h than in the equilibrium after five weeks. The rate determining step for carbon seems to be the dissolution of MOO3; the molybdic acid solution is far from saturation after 48 h and does not lower the pH of the slurry. 3.4. Hydrodesulfurization activity The catalysts were tested under fixed pressure of hydrogen, initial concentra- tion of thiophene and space time W/F(TH). The obtained dependencies of the conversion of thiophene on temperature are illustrated by examples shown in Fig. 2. The relative activities of the catalysts were evaluated by the procedure used already in our previous papers dealing with other catalysts [20,39]. It was checked previously that under fixed conditions of our test the dependence x(TH) =f[W/F(TH)] follows in the range of x(TH) from 0 to 0.90 a pseudo-first order rate equation with the apparent rate constant k. All catalysts were tested at the same fixed space time W/F(TH) and at several temperatures. Eq. (1) can be written for each temperature k(j) In[1 - x(TH,r)] (1) ln[1 -x(TH,j)] -- k(r) where j and r denote the j-th and the reference catalyst, respectively. The 22 E. Hillerov&, M.

Straight lines were obtained by plotting the conversions x(TH) at various temperatures according to Eq. (1). These linear correlations indicated that the apparent activation energies of the samples tested were the same. The ratios k(j)/k(r) were obtained from the slopes of the lines. They are independent of temperature and characterize the relative activity of catalysts in the whole range of tempera- tures measured. The values of them are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 and they are plotted against the catalyst loading in Fig. 3. The carbon supported samples were more active than alumina supported catalysts which is in agreement with the well known behaviour of Mo, Co-Mo and Ni-Mo sulfides prepared by the CIM using ammonium heptamolybdate [1,2,39,40]. The dependence of activity on MoO3 loading of SIM catalysts was compared with literature data on hydrodesulfurization of thiophene over catalysts prepared by other methods. For this purpose each set of data for the catalysts prepared and tested by the same method was normalized in the following way. The data were plotted in coordinates of activity against loading. The smooth curve was drawn by hand through the experimental points and the activity at the loading of 10% MoO3 was read out from the curve. The experimental activities at various loadings were then normalized to this activity: relative activity at a given loading was defined as experimentally observed activity divided by activity at the loading of 10% MoO3. The comparison of alumina supported catalysts is shown in Fig. 4. Thomas et al. [41] prepared catalysts by the incipient wetness method or by drying the suspension of the support with volumetric excess of ammonium heptamolybdate E. Hillerov~, M.

A slight deviation from linearity is observed for this set of catalysts in Fig. 4. A similarly small deviation from linearity was also observed in data of the present work. However, a different behaviour was observed in plotting the data by Pratt et al. [42]. A strong deviation from linearity is seen in Fig. 4 already at relatively low loading of about 10-15%, with the support surface area of 240 m2 g-l. This indicates poor dispersion of the active phase which was probably caused by the unusual preparation method: the ammonium heptamolybdate was deposited in three portions by repeated pore filling impregnation with intermediate drying. The comparison of carbon supported catalysts is shown in Fig. 5. Duchet et al. [16] prepared the catalysts by pore filling impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate of the active carbon with a BET area of 1000 m2 g- t. It is seen in Fig. 5 that the dependence obtained in the present work with SIM catalysts was exactly the same as observed by Duchet et al. with conventional catalysts. Observations in Figs. 4 and 5 suggest that the character and dispersion of the active phase obtained in SIM is the same as obtained by impregnation from ammonium heptamolybdate solution. With alumina of a surface area of about 200-250 m2 g- l, effective utilization of MoO3 can be achieved up to a loading of about 20%: the activity per unit of MoO3 is almost constant up to this loading. With active carbon of surface area of about 1000 m2 g-1, the activity per unit of MoO3 is slightly decreasing already from low loadings below 10% but the degree of the molybdenum utilization is still reasonable up to high loading of about 30%.

Conclusions Molybdena catalysts supported on alumina or active carbon were prepared by the new version of the equilibrium adsorption impregnation denominated slurry impregnation method: slurry of molybdenum(VI) oxide in water was used instead of commonly used solution of ammonium heptamolybdate. The highest loading achieved with alumina was 18 wt.-% MoO3 which corresponded to monolayer formation. Active carbon was saturated at the loading of 31 wt.-% MoO3. The hydrodesulfurization activity of the catalysts increased with loading in the same way as reported in the literature for catalysts prepared with the conventional impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate. The activity per unit of molybdena was almost constant up to the highest achieved loading of alumina. In the case of active carbon the activity per unit of molybdena slowly decreased in the whole range of the loading from zero to maximum. With the same support and molybdena loading the activity of the slurry impregnation and the conventional impregnation catalysts was the same. However, the slurry impregnation is advantageous: it is clean because no foreign ions are added, calcination can be left out which is especially important for active carbon support, all deposited species are adsorbed, precipitation of molybdena species does not occur during drying, and molybdenum waste solutions are not pro- duced.

(+42-2) 342073 The MoO3/alumina and Mo/active carbon catalysts of various loadings were prepared by the new slurry impregnation method (SIM). The slurry of MoO3 in water was added to the support. The pH of the slurry was 2.6 and this was favourable for the adsorption of molybdate anions on alumina and active carbon with the point of zero charge 7.0 and 7.5, respectively. The low solubility of MoO3 was sufficient to transport molybdenum species from solid MoO3 to the adsorbed phase. The equilibrium was achieved after 5 weeks at 30–50°C. The calcination was not necessary and was left out. This was especially advantageous for active carbon support which is susceptible to oxidative damage. The maximum loading achieved was 18 and 31 wt.-% MoO3 for Al2O3 (195 m2 g−1) and active carbon (1100 m2 g−1), respectively. The activity was tested in the hydrodesulfurization of thiophene at 1.6 MPa and 250–400°C. The activity of the SIM samples was similar to the activity of the catalysts prepared by the conventional impregnation method (CIM) with ammonium heptamolybdate. The dependence of the activity on loading for the SIM samples was the same as reported in the literature for CIM catalysts. On alumina the activity per unit of molybdena was constant in the whole range of the loading 0–18 wt.-% MoO3. On active carbon it gradually decreased in the whole range of the loading from 0 to 31 wt.-% MoO3. It is concluded that the nature of the SIM catalysts is the same as of the CIM catalysts but the SIM possesses several advantages.
