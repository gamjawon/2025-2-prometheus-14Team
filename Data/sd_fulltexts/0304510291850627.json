R. Patterson School of Chemistry, The Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast BT9 5AG (U.K.) (Received December 19, 1990; accepted January 16, 1991) The use of ^0 in mechanistic studies in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions on metal oxide catalysts has yielded much invaluable information over the past two decades or so. The heteromolecular and homomolecular exchange of gaseous oxygen and oxygen-containing species [1] has revealed the existence of many possible reaction pathways. More directly, the use of labelling techniques has done much to illuminate the reactivity of lattice oxygen in oxide-catalysed reactions [2-4]. Such studies have helped to clarify not only the distinction between the activities of adsorbed and lattice oxygens but also, in the case of mixed oxide catalysts, differences in the reactivity of lattice oxygen due to changes in ionic environment. In a series of recent publications Ruiz, Delmon and coworkers have described the catalytic activities of mechanical mixtures of metal oxides particularly with regard to the selective oxidation of simple olefins. They have proposed that a cooperative or synergistic effect can exist wherein a donor oxide may provide oxygen to an acceptor oxide by a spillover mechanism across a solid interphase boundary. Much attention has been given to the role of a-Sb2C>4 (as a donor) when mixed with oxides such as MoC>3 [5, 6], SnOa [6] and BigMoOg [7]. Direct evidence for the migration of an adsorbed oxygen species by such a mechanism has been claimed in a very recent paper through the use of 1SO labelling [8]. a-SbgC^, containing ca. 25% ^O, was mixed with pure light MoOa and reacted with propene in the absence of gaseous oxygen at 400 C. The products, acrolein, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, were all found to contain \"O, despite the fact that Sb2C>4 was shown, in contrast to MoOa, to be catalytically inactive for propene oxidation. These results were taken as conclusive evidence for the direct transfer of a mobile oxygen species from o;-Sb204 to MoOss in agreement with the spillover hypothesis previously advanced by the authors. Unfortunately, the results reported by Weng et al. relating to the appearance of ^O in the products are open to ambiguous interpretation. In addition to the spillover mechanism proposed by the authors to account for 0304-5102/91/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed m The Netherlands L42 the occurrence of \"0 in propene oxidation products, another explanation is provided by an exchange mechanism following the oxidation of propene on Moos, whereby \"0 originally present in a-Sb^O^ is transferred to MoOs using product-HgO and product-COa as carrier or transfer agents. Oxidation of propene by so-labelled MoOs would clearly lead to the observed accumulation of labelled products. Rates of exchange of oxygen between water and metal oxides can be extremely rapid. Whalley and Winter reported results at 120 C for ThOg and TiOa and at 200 C forAlgOa [9]. Novakova and Jiru found such exchange to proceed at room temperature on bismuth molybdate and to be very rapid at 200 C [10] while Wragg et al. agreed that HgO could remove oxygen from the surface by an exchange mechanism [11]. In more recent studies by Patterson and coworkers [3, 4] on the relative reactivity of lattice and adsorbed oxygen on tin-antimony oxide catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation at 400 C, great experimental care was taken to avoid ambiguities of interpretation due to the scrambling of oxygen isotopes by such exchange reactions. Nevertheless, a suspicion remained that exchange involving water had not been completely eliminated, so rapid was this reaction believed to be. Rates of exchange between COg and metal oxides are slower but never- theless are sufficiently rapid to be of concern with regard to the scrambling of oxygen. Exchange of oxygen between carbon dioxide and tin antimony oxide catalysts occurred at temperatures greater than 150-170 C and was immeasurably fast at 440 C [4]. A similar exchange reaction led to the appearance of ''O in acrolein during the oxidation of propene on bismuth molybdate at 200-400 C [12]. Weng et al. [8] report that mixtures of MoOs and a-SbaO^ were heated at 400 C under a recirculating stream of propene at 60 mbar, quoting isotopic product analyses obtained after 1 hour of such treatment, when conversions were ca. 5% at 50% selectivity to acrolein. Thus the catalysts were exposed to pressures of water vapour and carbon dioxide for a period of time and at a temperature which indicate the strong likelihood that equilibration of ^O between the exchangeable pools of surface oxygen on MoOs and SbgC^ could have been closely approached. The literature does not report anything on the ease of exchange of oxygen in acrolein with oxides. In the apparent absence of a facile mechanism for such a reaction, it is reasonable to assume that the level of ^O observed in product acrolein is due solely or largely to the oxidation of propene with a source of \"O. In the case of Weng et al. 's results, it is clear that a MoOa surface, isotopically enriched by an exchange mechanism, could be such a source. Whether this explanation would account for the total ^O content of acrolein product as measured by Weng et ai. cannot be assessed from the results provided [8]. A more detailed analysis would require some knowledge of (i) the number of oxygen anions in SbgO^ and MoOg capable of exchanging with HgO and COa and (ii) the closeness of approach to isotopic equilibrium between the two pools over the period of reaction. L43 In conclusion, there is reason to doubt that the appearance of \"O in propene oxidation products in the reactions described by Weng et al. [8] can be taken as conclusive evidence for the migration of an active oxygen species from a-SbgC^ to MoOy, since this is not the exclusive route by which their results could be Obtained.
