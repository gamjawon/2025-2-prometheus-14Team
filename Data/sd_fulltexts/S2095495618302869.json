Severe capacity fading and poor high rate performance of lithium sulfur (Li–S) battery caused by “shuttle effect” and low conductivity of sulfur hampers its further developments and applications. Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) possesses high lithium ion conductivity, and it is also can be used as an active adsorbent for polysulfide. Herein, fine LTO particle coated carbon nanofibers (CNF) were prepared and a conductive network both for electron and lithium ion was built, which can greatly promote the electrochemical conversion of polysulfide and improve the rate performance of Li–S batteries. Meanwhile, a quantity of adsorption sites is constructed by defects of the surface of LTO-CNF membrane to effectively immobilize polysulfide. The multifunctional LTO-CNF interlayer could impede the shuttle effect and enhance comprehensive electrochemical performance of Li–S batteries, especially high rate performance. With such LTO-CNF interlayer, the Li–S battery presents a specific capacity of 641.9 mAh/g at 5 C rate. After 400 cycles at 1 C, a capacity of 618.0 mAh/g is retained. This work provides a feasible strategy to achieve high performance of Li–S battery for practical utilization.

However, traditional electrochemical systems using LiCoO2 and LiFePO4 as cathode could not meet the demand of applications like electric vehicles because of their low specific capacity and energy density [1,2]. Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) battery with a high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh/g for sulfur cathode) and a high energy density (∼2600 Wh/kg and ∼2800 Wh/L) has attracted wide attentions [3–6]. Besides, sulfur is much cheaper and more environmentally friendly than the toxic element cobalt. Thus, Li–S battery is considered as one of the most promising next generation energy-storage devices [4,7]. However, Li–S system has some drawbacks which need to be solved before commercialization. First drawback is the low conductivity of pure sulfur (∼10−30 S cm−1) at room temperature and the large volume change about 76%. It is hard to achieve complete conversion of active substances without a good conductive network [8,9]. Second severe problem is the shuttle effect of polysulfides (Li2S x , 2 ≤ x ≤ 8) as intermediate products of Li–S battery during discharge. The polysulfides except Li2S and Li2S2 are all soluble in the organic electrolyte, which would move through the separator then migrate to the surface of lithium anode, causing side reactions and loss of active cathode material. In addition, lithium metal anode becomes passivated due to formation of the insoluble reduction products of Li2S and Li2S2 by polysulfides. All those lead to severe capacity fading and poor cycle performance [9–11]. A great deal of efforts have been put in improving the electrochemical performance of Li–S batteries. One of typical methods is to construct a confined structure that can limit the transfer of polysulfide. Many structured carbon materials are used to hold sulfur and intermediate, such as porous carbon [12,13], hollow carbon sphere [14,15], and ordered mesoporous materials [16,17]. These carbon materials have considerable specific surface area and rich porous structure. But they can only achieve physical adsorption without any assistance on further conversion of polysulfide. Many other compounds were also prepared in the similar design such as transition metal oxides cages [18,19]. Whereas, a complicated process and strict control of reaction conditions are always needed for removal of template during their preparation process. Although these materials realize high mass loading of S and large energy storage, there are still many issues in continuous and consistent production for industrial applications [20]. In addition, the design of cathode structure is difficult to achieve the purpose of accommodating the large volume change of the cathode and accelerating the transfer of polysulfides through physical adsorption and chemical catalysis. Another strategy to address the issues mentioned above is applying an interlayer between the cathode and separator such as a multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) layer to impede the transfer of polysulfide [21]. Carbon-based interlayer has been studied widely for Li–S batteries in recent years [22–24]. This carbon-based layer could improve the conductivity of cathode and utilization of sulfur. Another advantage of this carbon interlayer is to improve the performance of Li–S batteries by chemical adsorption derived from the diverse nanostructured decorations [25,26]. Oxides like Al2O3 [27], TiO2 [28,29], V2O5 [30] and MnO2 [31] have been embedded in the interlayers, which provide large surface area and plentiful adsorption sites. Metal sulfides [32,33], carbides [34], nitrides [35] and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) [36,37] such as FeS2 and Ti3C2 are chosen to be the host materials as well. Some of them can accelerate the lithium polysulfide electrochemical reactions like CoS2 [38] and VN [39]. However, their poor lithium ion conductivity limits mass loading of these sorbent. Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) was studied extensively as an anode material for lithium ion batteries because of its high lithium ion conductivity and structural stability, which were also applied in Li–S system [40–42]. For instance, a S/graphite/LTO multilayer hybrid Li–S battery was fabricated [43]. The adsorption effect of LTO was confirmed and the LTO can suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfide by chemical adsorption [41,44]. However, due to low electric conductivity of LTO, a carbon network is necessary when applying the LTO as the interlayer in the Li–S system. There are some methods to synthesize LTO, such as solid state sintering, sol-gel method and hydrothermal processing [45,46]. Sol-gel method is an effective method to grow the LTO on carbon film tightly because of the solid-liquid contact when dipping in the precursor. Due to the homogeneous precursor made by liquid state, small particle and pure LTO can be obtained by controlling sintering conditions [47,48]. Here, we propose a uniform and ultrathin LTO layer coated carbon nanofiber composite film (LTO-CNF) as an interlayer to prevent the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides and facilitate their conversion for high rate Li–S batteries. Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the proposed structure. The surface of the carbon nanofiber film is covered by a thin and continuous LTO nanolayer. The high ion conductivity LTO shell can help to transport the lithium ions, and the carbon nanofibers synthesized by electrospinning acting as a fine electric conductor (Fig. 1a). The LTO-CNF composite interlayer between cathode and separator can effectively adsorb polysulfides and ultrathin LTO layer is beneficial to the conversion of polysulfides. As a result, the sulfur can be highly utilized and shuttle effect would be impeded (Fig. 1b). The Li–S battery with a LTO-CNF interlayer has a significant rate performance of 641.9 mAh/g at 5 C. 1 C long cycle performance (618.0 mAh/g after 400 cycles) is also much better than traditional Li–S battery (318.5 mAh/g). 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of LTO-CNF The carbon nanofibers (CNF) was synthesized by electrospinning method. First, 1 g polyacrylonitrile (PAN) (average Mw = 150,000, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in the solvent of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with a mass ratio of 1:9 and stirred at 70 °C for 3 h. Then the solution was transferred into an injector of the electrospinning machine (TONG LI TECH, TL-Pro-BM). A roller covered by Al foil was used as the collector. The distance between the needle tip and collector was fixed at 15 cm and the voltage applied was set at 18 kV. The injection speed controlled by the pump was fixed at 1.2 mL/h. After 6 h electrospinning process, the PAN nanofiber membrane was heated in air at 280 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min for 2 h for pre-oxidation. After that the stabilized membrane was calcined at 1000 °C with the same heating rate for 2 h in Ar atmosphere to be carbonized. Afterwards, the CNF film was stamped into round pieces with a diameter of 16 mm. LTO was prepared by a sol-gel method. Firstly, 6.8 mL tetra-n-butyl titanate (TBT) was added dropwise into a saturated cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) solution with a volume of 12 mL and stirred for 2 h. Then, 0.621 g Li2CO3 and 11.492 g citric acid (CA) were added into the solution and stirred for another 2 h. After that, as prepared solution was followed by water bath at 80 °C for 3 h to form a homogeneous sol precursor. Next, the precursor was dropped onto the prepared CNF membrane, see Fig 1(d). The volume of precursor was controlled at 10 µL, 15 µL and 20 µL respectively in order to realize different mass loadings of LTO. The final sol is transparent and light yellow with a density of 1.235 g/mL. And the mass loadings of LTO containing in 10, 15, and 20 µL are 0.519, 1.038, and 1.557 mg/cm2. Afterwards, the precursor containing CNF membrane was dried at 80 °C in air for 3 h to form gelation and then calcined in Ar atmosphere at 700 °C for 10 h with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. LTO-CNF film interlayers with a thickness of about 60 µm were finally obtained. 2.2 Physical characterization The morphology of LTO-CNF films with different LTO mass loadings and separators was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, HITACHI SU8010). More details of structure were analyzed by a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F30). Energy dispersive spectrometers (EDS) equipped with SEM and TEM were used to get element mapping information. An X-Ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 100 mA, λ = 0.154 nm) was operated to analyze phase and crystal structure of as prepared LTO-CNF. Raman spectra was performed on a Raman spectroscope (HORIBA Lab RAM HR800) and a 532 nm Ar-ion laser was chosen. X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, PHI 5000 VersaProbe II) was applied to analyze the state of Ti element and confirm components of synthesized material. 2.3 Electrochemical measurements The cathode was prepared as follows. Nano S powder (Dk Nano technology, Beijing), Super P and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were mixed uniformly with a weight ratio of S:SP:PVDF = 6:3:1. N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP) as dispersant was added into the solid mixture to form cathode slurry. Carbon-coated Al foil served as current collector was coated with the slurry. The size of round cathode is 12 mm in diameter and the mass loading of S cathode is around 1 mg/cm2. CR2032 coin cells were assembled in a glove box for electrochemical measurements. Celgard 2400 polypropylene (PP) film was used as separator. And electrolyte was consisted of 1, 3-dioxolane (DOL) and dimethoxyethane (DME) with a volume ratio of 1:1, 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI), and 1% LiNO3 by weight. 60 µL electrolyte was added in each cell. Cyclic performances of coin cells were tested on a LAND 2001A system at room temperature with 0.3 C and 1 C rate. Rate performances were measured in the same condition with a series of rates (0.2 C, 0.3 C, 0.5 C, 1 C, 3 C, and 5 C). Measurement of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out via a VMP3 electrochemical workstation (Bio Logic Science Instruments). Symmetrical cells were assembled as CR2032 as well with carbon paper and LTO powder serving as both working and counter electrodes. Electrolyte for symmetrical cells consisted of 40 µL 0.5 mol/L Li2S6 and normal electrolyte that used in Li–S cells as mentioned above. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Morphology and structure of LTO-CNF films The morphology of CNF and different mass loadings LTO-CNF films is shown in Fig. 2 . Pure carbon nanofibers have a relative smooth surface (Fig. 2a), and the diameter of carbon nanofiber is about 250 nm. This CNF network can build up an excellent electric conductive network. Moreover, it is beneficial to buffering the volume expansion of sulfur cathode during cycles [28]. By contrast, fibers with LTO have a rougher surface and larger average diameter which is around 300 nm. The LTO nanoparticles and carbon fibers have a strong-bonded interface due to intimate solid-liquid contact by in-situ growth of LTO on the surface of fibers. This structure possesses following benefits. Firstly, the mechanical properties of network are enhanced and structure of LTO-CNF is difficult to be fractured. Secondly, the electric conductive skeleton can promote the electrochemical conversion of polysulfides, meanwhile the transfer of lithium ion can be promoted with the help of continuous LTO shell ascribed to its high ionic diffusion coefficient. Moreover, plentiful small particles enlarge the specific surface area, providing numerous adsorption sites to immobilize polysulfides. When LTO loading is relatively lower, such as 0.519 mg/cm2, uniform LTO particle layer may be covered on the carbon matrix (Fig. 2b). Whereas, when the LTO loading increases to 1.557 mg/cm2, it is seen that the LTO particles become enlarged and more dissociative LTO particles are found (Fig. 2d). Excessive LTO appears between fibers and fills in the hole. These isolated LTO particles do not have sufficient contact with conductive fiber and may hinder lithium ion migration in electrolyte. Fig. 3 (a) shows the XRD patterns of LTO-CNF composite membranes with different mass loadings. Four strongest peaks can be seen clearly at the angle of 18.3°, 35.6°, 43.2° and 62.8°, which are corresponding to the standard spinel LTO diffraction spectrum (JCPDS NO. 49-0207), suggesting that the LTO was formed on the CNF. Since there is no significant variation in the structure of LTO-CNF membrane, the one with 10 µL precursor was taken as an example to be analyzed. Fig. 3(b) shows Raman spectrum of LTO-CNF composite, pure LTO and CNF. The D and G peak (1357 cm−1 and 1577 cm−1 respectively) of composite are well matched with that of CNF. The peak at 175 cm−1 is corresponding to one of peaks from LTO pattern (175 cm−1, 402 cm−1, and 643 cm−1). In order to further confirm the existence of LTO, higher laser power and longer integration time were applied during Raman spectrum of LTO-CNF composite examination. It is seen that the peak at 175 cm−1 becomes sharper (Fig. 3b), suggesting the existence of LTO on CNF. In the XPS spectra shown in Fig. 3(c), two peaks at 464.5 eV and 458.8 eV corresponding to Ti 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2, can be seen clearly, which is assigned to Ti4+ [49]. All these evidences prove that a composite film based on carbon fibers is successfully prepared with a LTO particle shell. TEM image clearly shows that typical diameter of composite fibers is about 300 nm (Fig. 3d). Quantities of fine LTO grains are covered on fiber, which can build up a high lithium ion conductivity network, allowing Li+ pass through with less resistance. Fine structure of LTO-CNF was further studied by TEM. In Fig. 4 (a), it can be seen that LTO particles tightly adhere on the surface of carbon fibers, which show an average diameter of less than 10 nm and nearly every LTO particle is a tiny single crystal (Fig. 4b). High resolution TEM image of LTO particles present that they have a well-defined crystalline structure and lattice plane spacing of 0.209 nm and 0.252 nm, matching with (400) and (311) interplanar spacing of LTO (Fig. 4c). Besides, many defects can be found in the crystal, such as point defects and dislocations. Generally, atoms at defects and boundaries have higher energy and they are easier to bond with other atoms to generate chemical adsorption. The EDS elemental mapping of a fiber with fractured LTO shell shows uniform distributions of oxygen and titanium (Fig. 4d), indicating uniform coating of LTO on carbon fiber. The carbon presents almost everywhere on composite fiber, suggesting that LTO shell is not completely electrical insulated. LTO particles have a great contact with conductive carbon, which may be beneficial to the conversion of polysulfides. Rate performances of Li–S cells with different mass loadings of LTO-CNF interlayers are shown in Fig. 5 (a). Cells were tested at rates of 0.2 C, 0.3 C, 0.5 C, 1 C, 3 C, 5 C, and back to 0.2 C (1 C = 1675 mAh/g). It is obvious that the LTO-CNF interlayer can improve the capacity of Li–S batteries, especially at a high rate. As a contrast, the capacity of bare S batteries decreases greatly from 443.2 to 213.6 mAh/g when the rate turns from 1 to 3 C. When the rate switches to 5 C, there is only 139.5 mAh/g. Cells with CNF interlayer have similar behaviors although the capacity has a little increase in every rate step. Notable polarization occurs at high rates, which leads to very short second discharge platform that even disappear in voltage range from 1.7 to 2.8 V. While serious polarization does not exist when using LTO-CNF interlayers, indicating enhancement of the ability of lithium ion transportation. Different LTO mass loadings slightly affect rate performance, and interlayer with 10 µL precursor present the highest rate capacity and a value of 641.9 mAh/g was achieved at 5 C. Charging and discharging curves of 10 µL LTO-CNF interlayer are plotted in Fig. 5(b). The two discharge platforms can be clearly observed at all rates. The cycle performance at 1 C is shown in Fig. 5(c). The initial specific capacity of 10 µL LTO-CNF interlayer cell is 1237.1 mAh/g. After 400 cycles, a capacity of 618.0 mAh/g is retained, which is much larger than that of cell with CNF interlayer and bare S cell. Fig. 5(d) shows the cycling performance at 0.3 C. Interlayer with loading of 10 µL precursor also exhibits the best performance. Actually, the performance difference of cells with series of LTO-CNF interlayers is slight. All the cells using LTO-CNF films give a specific capacity over 660 mAh/g after 50 cycles at 0.3 C, and the cell using interlayer with loading 10 µL retained the capacity of 722.7 mAh/g. Fig. 5(e) shows the CV profile of Li–S cell using 10 µL LTO-CNF interlayer. One anodic split doublet (2.3–2.4 V) and two cathodic peaks (2.05 V and 2.3–2.35 V) can be seen. An apparent shift of cathodic peak from 2.295 to 2.324 V is observed after first scan cycle, which is attributed to activation process. Then anodic and cathodic peak current almost do not change in following CV cycles which means that the system has a good electrochemical stability. Besides, the CV of 10 µL LTO-CNF interlayer cell without S cathode was tested for 3 cycles with the same condition. There is no redox peak current as shown in Fig. 5(e), indicating that LTO is electrochemically stable at 1.7–2.8 V and has no obvious capacity contribution. EIS was tested after 2 cycles and 50 cycles at 1 C (Fig. 5f, g). All the curves consist of two semicircles and an inclined line. The diameter of semicircle in high frequency represents interfacial resistance (R f), and the other one is corresponding to charge transfer resistance (R ct). It is seen that the R f decreases by an order after 50 cycles and the R ct decreases from 5.333 to 1.975 Ω as cycle number increases from 2 to 50 in LTO-CNF cell, while pure S cell just decreases from 12.829 to 5.690 Ω. This result proves that the conversion of polysulfides is much easier via a LTO-CNF interlayer with a conductive network both for electron and lithium ion. In order to investigate the influence of LTO on lithium ion diffusion, a CV measurement with a series of scan rate was carried out. At 25 °C, the diffusion coefficient of lithium ion could be estimated by simplified Randles–Sevcik equation [50,51]: i p = 2.69 × 10 5 × n 3 / 2 · A · D 1 / 2 · C · v 1 / 2 where i p is the peak current, n is number of electrons that participate the reaction, A is effective area of electrode, D is diffusion coefficient of lithium ion, C is the variation of lithium ion concentration, v is scan rate and the lower voltage cathodic peak would be used. A is the area of cathode, which is 1.131 cm2 and n is 2 in Li–S system. The concentration of lithium ion C is 10−3 mol/cm3. The square root of D has positive correlation with the slope of i p ∼ v 1/2 curve. Fig. 6 (a, b) shows CV results of LTO-CNF interlayer cell and pure S cell. It is seen that the shape of anodic split doublet has a little difference, and LTO-CNF cell delivers larger current at the same scan rate. The slope of i p ∼ v 1/2 curves for LTO-CNF cell is 0.1145, which is slightly larger than the slope of pure S curve (0.1071, Fig. 6c). It can be obtained that the diffusion coefficient of lithium ion in LTO-CNF interlayer battery is 1.78 × 10−8 cm2/s, a little larger than that in the pure S system, 1.56 × 10−8 cm2/s. The D value in CNT interlayer Li–S cell was also measured and it was 1.30 × 10−8 cm2/s, which is the least because of hindering of lithium ion by carbon fibers and hard-wetting interfaces. Symmetrical batteries were assembled to investigate the effect of LTO in Li–S system. The dispersion liquid with LTO was dropped on carbon papers and the mass loading of LTO powder is controlled to 0.5 mg followed by drying to obtain the electrode (LTO-C) of symmetric cells. An electrolyte containing Li2S6 was applied. As contrast, carbon paper (annotated as C) without LTO cell and LTO-C with common electrolyte cell were assembled and tested. The scan rate was 50 mV/s and scan range was −0.8 –0.8 V. Polarization curves are shown in Fig. 6(d). It is found that the current is nearly zero for the system without Li2S6, suggesting that the current comes from electrochemical conversion of Li2S6 for the system with Li2S6. The current density increases when LTO exits in electrodes. Thus, LTO could facilitate electrochemical reaction of polysulfide, resulting in significant high rate performance and high utilization ratio of sulfur. To confirm the adsorbing effect of LTO-CNF interlayer, the morphology and sulfur mapping of separators were characterized by SEM. Separators of lithium metal side from 10 µL LTO-CNF interlayer cell and bare sulfur cell after 50 cycles at 1 C were observed (Fig. 6e, f). It is seen that the separator of LTO-CNF cell is cleaner and smoother than the other one, while some insoluble particles is loaded on the separator of bare sulfur cell, mainly Li2S and Li2S2. Insets show the distribution of sulfur element and its corresponding content with a LTO-CNF interlayer is 1.01% by atom, much less than 4.45% in the cell without interlayer. Therefore, the amount of polysulfides that transfers to the surface of lithium anode decreased obviously. LTO performs a significant adsorption ability for polysulfide, and it can effectively suppress the shuttle effect in Li–S system. 4 Conclusions An efficient Li–S battery multifunctional interlayer was synthesized via in-situ synthesis of LTO on electrospun carbon nanofibers. The ultrafine LTO grains construct a high lithium ion conductivity shell, which is also an active adsorbent of polysulfide. LTO shell and carbon nanofibers build up lithium ion and electron pathways to form a conductive network. Defects, grain boundaries, and non-crystal carbon provide adsorption sites for polysulfide. Well synergistic effect of multifunctional LTO-CNF interlayer accelerates the electrochemical conversion of polysulfide and weakens its shuttle effect, which greatly improves the cyclic and rate performances of Li–S batteries. In addition, its interfacial resistance and charge transfer resistance of the Li–S batteries with LTO-CNF interlayer after cycles decrease greatly compared with no-interlayer cells. Furthermore, the lithium ion diffusion coefficients increase by a LTO-CNF interlayer. As a result, the Li–S battery with such LTO-CNF interlayer presents a specific capacity of 641.9 mAh/g at 5 C rate and a capacity of 618.0 mAh/g is retained after 400 cycles at 1 C. This work gives a convenient method to control the morphology of LTO-CNF interlayer to improve Li–S battery performance.

Herein, fine LTO particle coated carbon nanofibers (CNF) were prepared and a conductive network both for electron and lithium ion was built, which can greatly promote the electrochemical conversion of polysulfide and improve the rate performance of Li–S batteries. Meanwhile, a quantity of adsorption sites is constructed by defects of the surface of LTO-CNF membrane to effectively immobilize polysulfide. The multifunctional LTO-CNF interlayer could impede the shuttle effect and enhance comprehensive electrochemical performance of Li–S batteries, especially high rate performance. With such LTO-CNF interlayer, the Li–S battery presents a specific capacity of 641.9 mAh/g at 5 C rate. After 400 cycles at 1 C, a capacity of 618.0 mAh/g is retained. This work provides a feasible strategy to achieve high performance of Li–S battery for practical utilization.",
