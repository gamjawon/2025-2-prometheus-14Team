Research and Development Center. 912 Appleton Road, Elkton, MD 21921, USA Received 20 July 1994; accepted 23 January 1995 Abstract The microstructure in terms of molecular mass distribution (MMD) and chemical comonomer distribution (CCD) of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) is greatly influenced by the catalytic system and process conditions. Furthermore, the l- olefin insertion in the polymer chain can be distinguished between intramolecular and intermolecular distribution. To investigate the intermolecular CCD and the MMD, four LLDPEs (ethylene-1-butene copolymers) from different catalytic systems based on Ti/MgCl, catalysts, a zirconocene complex and a vanadium compound, are studied. The microstructure of the whole polymers and of their fractions are examined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and 13C NMR analysis. Further information about CCD is also obtained by DSC analysis on the whole samples by applying a particular thermal treatment, named thermal fractionated crystallization (TFC), based on isothermal crystallization of the polymers from the melt at fixed temperatures. The results obtained with the different analytical techniques show that the examined polymers have a very distinct microstructure depending on the catalyst type.

Introduction Linear low density polyethylenes (LLDPE) are linear polyethylenes containing a small amount of short chain branching (SCB) along the chains due to the insertion of 1 -olefin units during the polym- erization reaction [ 11. The polymer microstructure in terms of molec- ular mass distribution (MMD) and chemical com- onomer distribution (CCD) greatly depends on the catalytic system and polymerization condi- tions [2-l 11. It is reported that a great extent of * Corresponding author. 1381-l 169/95/$09.50 0 1995 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDI1381-1169(95)00025-9 polymerization active sites are present in hetero- geneous catalytic systems [2-4,12] in compari- son to homogeneous zirconocene-based catalysts [ 13 ] . This difference is responsible for the differ- ent MMDs [ 131 of the polymers, while only few works investigating the CCD of polymers from zirconocenes are published [ 14,151. The 1-olefin insertion modes in polyethylene result both in intermolecular and intramolecular distribution heterogeneity. In the former case the 1-olefin can be homogeneously distributed along the single macromolecular chain, but each chain differs in composition from the other. In the latter case the 1-olefin is non-randomly distributed 124 Table 1 G.

Another interesting topic is whether or not the CCD is related to the MMD. The analysis on cross-fractionated commercial LLDPEs [ 161 shows an inverse relationship between short chain branching content and molecular mass. In order to investigate the microstructure of the polymers obtained from different catalytic sys- tems, four samples of LLDPE (ethylene-l- butene) of similar chemical composition are prepared and their main characteristics are reported in Table 1. The polymers are fractionated by olution fractional crystallizationand ana- lyzed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and 13C NMR. Further information about CCD are also obtained by DSC analysis on the raw samples by applying a particular thermal treatment (thermal fractionated crystallization, TFC) [ 171. This method is based on several steps of isothermal crystallization of the polymer on decreasing the temperature from the melt. This process favours the separation of the crystalline material in groups of lamellae having different thicknesses depend- ing on the amount and distribution of the 1-olefin units in the macromolecular chains. In fact, according to the exclusion model [ 181, which describes the crystallite formation from copoly- mer chains comprised of units that can crystallize and units that cannot, the thickening of the poly- ethylene lamellae can be hindered by the presence of a 1-olefin unit at the chain folding. The fold period will thus depend on the frequency of not crystallizing units along the copolymer chains. The subsequent melting endotherm is made up of the same number of peaks as the isothermal crys- tallization steps. The area of the thermogram is proportional to the total amount of the crystalline part of the polymer, and the partial area between two fixed temperatures is proportional to the amount of crystalline material comprising lamel- lae of a specific size (the Thomson and Gibbs equation relates the lamella thickness to the melt- ing temperature). Thus, by dividing the melting thermogram into 5 zones, it is possible to assign to each one an average SCB content (Table 2). These concepts are, in summary, depicted in Fig. Table 2 Correlation between melting range and LLDPE composition a Zone A B C D E Melting range () > 120 100-120 80-100 50-80 <50 SCB(CH,/lOOC) <1.2 1.2-3.6 3.6-6.0 6.0-9.6 >9.6 a Determined by DSC analysis (standard method) of narrow TREF fractions ( SCB vs. T,,,) . bByFI-IRat 1375cm- G.

The distribution of the endotherm in zones per- mits the calculation of the areas (see Experimental and Table 5). and provides a semi- quantitative evaluation of the CCD. 2. Experimental The polymers are synthesized on laboratory scale by using catalytic systems of different fam- ilies, as reported in Table 1, in the best polymer- ization conditions. 2. I. Polymerization Polymers l-3 are obtained with the following procedure; propane ( 1.6 I), 1-butene, ethylene and hydrogen, in suitable amounts, are introduced into a thermostatically controlled 2.6 1 stainless steel autoclave purified with an ethylene stream at 80. The polymerization temperatures are 50- 75. Catalyst and aluminum alkyl are mixed in 10 ml of solvent (hexane or toluene) , aged 5 min and added to the autoclave through a stainless steel vial with an ethylene overpressure. The total polymerization pressure is maintained constant by continuous feeding of ethylene/ 1 -butene mixture. After degassing the monomers and propane, the polymer is isolated and dried in vacuum at 60. The same procedure is applied to polymer 4 except that hexane is used instead of propane. 2.2. Fractionation Preparative fractionation (solution fractionated crystallization) is performed by dissolving the polymers in xylene at 120 in presence of 0.1 wt.-% of 2,6-di-t-butyl-p-cresol (BHT) and then cooling the solution to the collecting temperature of 55. After 1 h aging, the first soluble portion is collected. The same procedure is repeated for all the fractions at the temperatures 70,80,90 and 110. 2.3.

Monodisperse fractions are used as stan- dard. The universal calibration is performed by using the Mark-Houwink constants calculated from those of polyethylene following the Scholte method [ 191. 2 4 NMR . . The 13C NMR spectra are recorded at 130 on a Varian Unity-300 spectrometer operating at 75.4 MHz in the Fourier transform mode. About 6000 transients are accumulated for each spectrum with a 90pulse and 12 s delay period between pulses. The sample solutions in 10 mm o.d. glass tubes are prepared by dissolving the polymer in 1,1,2,2- tetrachloro- 1 ,Zdideuteroethane to give an 8% (wt./vol.) concentration. The assignments are made according to Randall and Hsieh [ 201. In our experimental conditions, the calculation according to their method gives an imprecise estimation of [ BBB] and [ BBE] triads because of the low 1-butene content. With the exception of fraction 1 of sample 2, which has a detectable amount of [BBB] triads, dyad distri- butions are determined by measuring the peak areas as individual peaks or small ranges. The ethylene and 1-butene average sequence lengths 12, and $,, are calculated according to the equations: n,=(2.[EE]/[EB])+l (2) nb=(2.[BB]/[EB])+l (3) The monomer reactivity ratio product, rl - r,, is determined from the dyad distribution according to the equation: r,.r*= (4. [EE] - [BB])/( [EB] . [EB]) (4) if: rl . r2 > 1, the polymer tends to a blocky struc- ture; rl - r2 = 1, the structure is random; rl * r2 = 0, the comonomer units are isolated. 2.5. Standard DSC analysis Calorimetric measurements are performed by using a differential scanning calorimeter Perkin Elmer DSC-7. The instrument is calibrated with indium and tin standards. Weighed samples ( 10 mg) are sealed into aluminum pans, heated to 180 and kept at that temperature for long enough (4 min) to allow complete melting of all the crystallites; in this way any influence of the previous thermal history is removed. Then, after slow cooling at lO/min to O, the samples are heated to 180 at a rate of lO/min. 2.6. Thermal fractionated crystallization (TFC) In order to achieve a fractionation of the poly- mer in terms of lamella size, the melted sample G. Balbontin et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 98 (1995) 123-133 127 ( 180) is cooled at nominal rate of 2OO/min to fixed crystallization temperatures of T,, = 12O, Tc2 = lOO, T,, = 80 Tc4 = 50 and T,, = 0. An isothermal crystallization time of 120 min is chosen in order to achieve complete crystallization of the polymer fractions at the fixed temperature. Finally the sample is heated at lO/ min to 180 and the corresponding DSC curve is recorded. The thermogram curve, characterized by the same number of peaks as the isothermal crystallization temperatures, is then divided into five parts: area between 120 and the end of the curve; area B, in the range 100-l 20; area in the range 80-100; area in the range 50-80; area below 50. Finally, by using the calculating program of DSC-7, the partial areas of the thermogram are calculated. 3. Results and discussion 3. I. Fractionation Detailed information about the microstructure of polymers can be obtained only by analysing their fractions. Our method is substantially based on fractionation by crystallite size. In other words, polymer chains with increasing ethylene sequence length will be dissolved at higher temperature as is for TREF analysis [ 221. In Fig. 2a-d and Table 3 are shown the fraction distributions of the four LLDPEs, and Fig. 3a and 3b display the SCB content and intrinsic viscosity (I.V.) as a function of the elution temperature, respectively.

Polymer 1 is separated into only three fractions; fraction 2, eluted at 7O, is more than 50 wt.-% of the whole polymer. The SCB content slightly decreases (Fig. 3a) from fraction 1 to 3 while the molecular mass (as I.V.) (Fig. 3b) is almost con- stant, suggesting a separation by crystallite size. From these data it is possible to deduce that pol- ymer 1 is homogeneous in composition. Polymer 2 is distributed over all the five frac- tions (Fig. 2b). A remarkable amount of polymer soluble at a temperature higher than 90 (frac- tion 4 and 5) is obtained, meaning that a low l- butene insertion degree in the macromolecular chain occurs (Fig. 3a). Furthermore the SCB con- tent greatly decreases from fraction 1 to 5, evi- dencing the heterogeneity of the comonomer distribution. Polymer 3 shows a fractionation behaviour sim- ilar to polymer 1 with only a small amount of material soluble at a temperature higher than 90 (Fig. 3c), but with a SCB distribution very similar to that of polymer 2 (Table 2). Again, as for polymer 2, fraction 1 displays the highest SCB content. Polymer 4, which contains the highest 1-butene percentage and has the highest molecular mass (MM) (Table 1) , shows a distribution of its frac- tions in the whole temperature range but with about the 80% of the polymer in the first two fractions. The SCB content slowly decreases on increasing the extraction temperature (fraction 1 to 3, Fig. 3a), while an increase of the MM is observed (Fig. 3b). This particular behaviour sug- gests that the separation occurred by MM instead of by crystallinity. al , ,A, , 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5 6 6.5 7 A A b) / H-1 / \\ / \\ \\ 2.5 3 3.6 4 4.6 5 5.5 6 6.5 7 cl 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5 6 6.5 7 n d) 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 6 6.5 6 6.5 7 Log Molecular Weight Fig. 4.

Shaded peaks are due to the presence of 1 -butene sequences. In conclusion, from these data, it is possible to draw the following homogeneity order: LLDPE 1 > LLDPE 4 > LLDPE 3 > LLDPE 2. 3.2. Analysis on the fractions It is recognized from literature that a narrow MMD can be obtained only if the catalytic system comprises a limited (better if it is a single) type of catalytic sites [ 231. According to this hypoth- esis, it is also reasonable to expect a similar behav- iour versus the comonomer reactivity, i.e. each catalytic site produces a polymeric chain with a particular composition. In order to throw some light on these concepts, SEC and 13C NMR anal- ysis on the fractions are performed. 3.3. SEC The MM data are collected in Table 3 and rep- resented in Fig. 4. A great difference between the polymers is observed. Polymer 1, from homogeneous catalyst, shows the narrowest molecular mass distribution (MMD) typical of these systems [ 131. Moreover, its fractions have the same molecular mass and MMD as the whole polymer. Polymer 2 has the broadest MMD, higher than the typical polydispersity shown by Ti based sys- tems ($,J& =: 3-6). Its fractions are narrower than the whole polymer and their MM increases in the order: fraction 1 < 2 < 3 = 4 G 5 (see also Fig. 3b and Table 3). Conversely, the SCB content decreases as already reported for commercial polymers [ 161. Polymer 3 and its fractions have a symmetric MMD. From the analysis of the fractions, it is observed a decrease of SCB as for polymer 2 while the &,, remains practically constant. Polymer 4, which has the highest I-butene con- tent as well as MM, displays an asymmetric MMD, characterized by a high MM tail. The frac- tions show different MM and MMD and, as for polymer 2, the SCB decreases as the MM increases. It is interesting to note that fractions 1 and 2, with similar SCB content, have very dif- ferent MM ( 192000 and 579000 g/mol respec- tively) and MMD (Fig. 4d). 3.4. 13C NA4R The spectra of the polymers together with the most interesting expanded region of all the frac- tions, are shown in Fig. 5.

Not calculated due to the undetectability of the [BB] dyad. The results obtained show that polymer 1 is highly homogeneous. Its fractions have similar comonomer content and tie values, while the l- butene units are mainly isolated ( [ BB] = 0 and r,*r,=O). Polymer 2 shows a broad chemical comonomer distribution. The fractions have a 1-butene content ranging from 13.5 mol% in fraction 1 to less than 1 mol% in fraction 4. Furthermore, fractions 1 and 2 show an appreciable content of [ BB ] sequences (see $, value) and their rl . r, (higher than 1) emphasize the blocky structure. As a consequence these fractions need more I-olefin amount to be eluted at a fixed temperature (see Fig. 2a). The 6e values increase from fraction 1 to 4, becoming higher than 100, and approaching those of HDPE (ne=w) [21]. Polymer 3 has a 1-butene distribution and an ethylene sequence length distribution similar to polymer 2. However the rl . r2 value in fraction 1 is close to 1 as in nearly random copolymers. Though 1 -butene monomer inversions have been detected in LLDPE [ 81 made with vana- dium-based catalysts, no inversions are detected in polymer 4, probably due to the low I-butene content and low [BB] dyad sequence level. The &, and Ze values of the first two fractions are com- parable within the experimental error. A precise evaluation of these parameters for the remaining fractions is difficult to obtain because of the low 1-butene content. Considering that about the 80 wt.-% of the whole polymer is composed of the fractions 1 and 2, it is reasonable to consider pol- ymer 4 homogeneous in CCD. Table 5 G.

DSC - thermal fractionated crystallization VW The use of the DSC after the TFC treatment provides qualitative information about the ethyl- ene sequence length and their distribution in the macromolecular chains [ 171. In Table 5 and Fig. 6 are shown the data and the endotherms, after TFC treatment, of the four polymers and their fractions. The fractions of polymer 1 melt almost in the same range of the whole sample and show melting curves with similar shape. Furthermore, about 50% of the polymer and of the fractions melt in the range of temperature defining the zone to which corresponds a SCB content (Table 2) between 1.2-3.6 CHJ 1OOC. The same results are also found by IR analysis (Table 3). Moreover, 13C NMR data agree with the fact that the 1-butene is equally distributed in all the fractions. Polymer 2 shows the broadest melting curve covering the range between the zones A-E; its fractions melt in different ranges of temperatures with different SCB content and have narrower endotherms. This reflects the efficiency of the fractionation according to crystallite size (Fig. 5b). The whole polymer has about 50% of the 132 G.

For polymer 3, area is higher than area in spite of a lower 1-butene content than polymer 2 (Table 5 ) . Again, the thermograms of the frac- tions evidenced a distribution intermediate between polymers 1 and 2 but closer to polymer 2. Polymer 4 has a considerable melting-heat in the range of temperature defining zones and D, like polymer 1. Fractions 4 and 5, com- posed of poorly modified PE chains, do not con- tribute significantly to the endotherm of the whole polymer because of their small amount. 4. Conclusion The evaluation of the chemical composition distribution from DSC data (after TFC) on the whole polymers are in good agreement with data from 13C NMR and IR analysis on the polymer fractions. The four catalytic systems produce polymers with different microstructure regarding MM and 1-butene insertion. Homogeneous catalysts give a good distribu- tion of the comonomer in all the fractions: both polymer 1 and 4 show a constant value of the average ethylene sequence length in all the frac- tions and the rl * r2 value is close to 0 or much less than 1. Furthermore, the narrow MMD of polymer 1 may suggest that a single family of catalytic sites or more than one, but with the same k,/k, (where kp and k,, are the kinetic polymerization and trans- fer constants, respectively) are effective. The same consideration applies to polymer 4 taking into account that a great extent of the whole polymer is in fraction 1. Fraction 2 differs only in MM and MMD. Thus it should be stressed that polymer 4 has a narrow CCD independent of the fact that MMD of the fractions is not homogene- ous. Polymers with different characteristics are obtained from heterogeneous catalysts, in fact the broad MMD and CCD observed could be explained by hypothesizing more families of active sites [ 31 having different reactivity toward comonomer and different sensitivity to hydrogen as MM regulator. The 13C NMR analysis on frac- tion of polymer 2 shows in addition to the different comonomer content a tendency to a blocky struc- ture as deduced from the rI . r2 value (Table 4). It is worth noting that the MMD and CCD are two distinct characteristics of the polymer, inde- pendent from each other and related only to the G. Balbontin et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 98 (1995) 123-133 133 particular catalytic system. For example, poly- mers 1 and 4 show similar CCD but different MMD and polymers 2 and 3, both from hetero- geneous MgC12 supported titanium catalysts, show different CCD and MMD. References [I] D.E.

The microstructure in terms of molecular mass distribution (MMD) and chemical comonomer distribution (CCD) of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) is greatly influenced by the catalytic system and process conditions. Furthermore, the 1-olefin insertion in the polymer chain can be distinguished between intramolecular and intermolecular distribution. To investigate the intermolecular CCD and the MMD, four LLDPEs (ethylene—1-butene copolymers) from different catalytic systems based on Ti MgCl2 catalysts, a zirconocene complex and a vanadium compound, are studied. The microstructure of the whole polymers and of their fractions are examined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and 13C NMR analysis. Further information about CCD is also obtained by DSC analysis on the whole samples by applying a particular thermal treatment, named thermal fractionated crystallization (TFC), based on isothermal crystallization of the polymers from the melt at fixed temperatures. The results obtained with the different analytical techniques show that the examined polymers have a very distinct microstructure depending on the catalyst type.
