Both the total reaction rate and the selectivity for ethane formation are strongly influenced by the two parameters as well as by the reduction temperature. Rather unexpectedly, an addition of small quantities of nickel to Rh/y-AI203 catalysts increases their ability for central C-C bond rupture, in spite of the tendency of this metal to split terminal bonds in hydrocarbons.

Introduction The aim of this work was to study the transformations of C4 hydrocarbons which are produced by the petrochemical industry in rather large amounts, into econom- ically more interesting products. From this point of view, the hydrogenolysis of butane to propane or to ethane could be interesting provided the hydrogenolysis is selective enough. In an earlier paper [ 1 ] we have described a supported nickel catalyst which splits the terminal C-C bonds in butane with a good selectivity, since 1 mol of butane produces 0.93 mol of propane.

Leclercq et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 161 172 finding catalysts that selectively break butane to ethane, and we have tried to associate nickel with rhodium which, when deposited on a support, has been reported to split preferentially internal C-C bonds in saturated hydrocarbons [2]. In the first paper [3] of this series we have reported an attempt to study the surface composition of these catalysts and have shown that, for catalysts reduced at 450, while rhodium is completely reduced to metal, nickel is only partly reduced. Reduction at 700 and 900 resulted in a higher degree of reduction of nickel. As far as the surface composition is concerned, no nickel surface enrichment -- which might occur as indicated by thermodynamic calculations -- was evidenced after reduction at 450, probably because of the high metal dispersion. After reduction at 700 and 900 chemisorption measurements and X-ray photoelec- tron spectroscopy (XPS) have clearly shown that such a nickel surface enrichment Occurs. In this paper we report the variations of the activity and of the selectivities of Ni-Rh/y-A1203 catalysts in the hydrogenolysis of butane as a function of the composition. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials The details of the preparation of the catalysts have been given in Part I [ 3 ]. The support was y-alumina GBS (Rh6ne-Poulenc, France) with a surface area of ca. 200 m2/g and a pore volume of 0.60 cm3/g. It was impregnated with precursor solutions (RhC13 and Ni(NO3)2) in excess water. The water was evaporated and the resulting powders were dried in an oven at about 120 for 12 h. The catalysts were reduced in situ in flowing hydrogen (5-6 l/h); the temperature was raised at a rate of 160 K/h and the final reduction temperature: 450, 700 or 900 was maintained for about 15 h. The catalyst notations and their compositions are given in Table 1. 2.2. Hydrogenolysis experiments Butane hydrogenolysis was studied in a continuous flow system with a fixed catalyst bed at atmospheric pressure, with hydrogen and hydrocarbon partial pres- sures equal to 0.9 and 0.1 atm, respectively ( 1 atm= 1.01325 105 Pa). Hydrogen (Air Liquide, France; quality R) was purified through a Deoxo cata- lytic purifier (from Comptoir Lyon-Alemand Louyot, France) and two traps ( silica gel, zeolite 13X). Butane was of the N35 quality ( > 99.95%) from Air Liquide; it was passed through a trap with zeolite 4A. The product mixture was analyzed with a gas chromatograph equipped with a 50 m capillary column (squalane) and a FID detector. The reaction rates were G.

Results and discussion 3.1. Activities The activities of all catalysts were fairly stable, with some deactivation occurring at temperatures higher than 150. At 220, the rate of deactivation was approx- imately 10% of initial activity per hour. The rates of butane hydrogenolysis at 220 on the catalysts reduced at 450 are reported in Table 1 together with the compositions of the catalysts and the amounts of hydrogen chemisorbed by one gram of catalyst from ref. [3]. First of all, as already known [4-6], nickel is far less active than rhodium in hydrogenolysis [ about 400 times less active in n-butane hydrogenolysis at 220 with Pbutane = 0.1 atm and Phydrogen = 0.9 atm (see Table 1 ) ]. The activities of bimetallic catalysts reduced at 450 do not vary linearly as 164 G.

This could be explained by a surface enrichment in nickel. However, for the two bimetallic catalysts which have been studied by chemisorption, NR 2-80 and NR 0.5-40, such a surface enrichment has not been confirmed after reduction at 450. Moreover, for the catalyst NR 2-80 a H/metal ratio of 0.68 has been found, with 157/xmol Rh/g and 44/~mol Ni/g in the unreduced catalyst [ 3 ], and even if all the nickel atoms were segregated at the surface, 93 /xmol Rh/g would still be present on the surface, corresponding to a H/Rhs stoichiometry of 1. Now if, in a first approximation, the activities of bime- tallic catalysts are assumed to be essentially that of rhodium, since nickel is much less active, the turnover number of rhodium should be 4.35 s ~, for NR 2-100, and 3.1 s - ~ for NR 2-80. Hence even if nickel was segregated at the surface, this cannot by itself account for the variations of activities of the bimetallic catalysts. It must be pointed out that similar curves for the activities of bimetallic catalysts in hydrogenolysis of alkanes have already been obtained, for example for Ni-Cu [7] and Rh-Ir [8] systems. This can easily be explained. It has been shown that hydrogenolysis of alkanes is a structure and ensemble size sensitive reaction [7,9,10 ]. In this case where very active rhodium atoms are diluted by far less active nickel atoms, the probability of finding ensembles of highly active rhodium atoms decreases strongly by the addition of nickel, hence the rate of alkane hydrogenolysis is decreased on bimetallic catalysts compared to rhodium alone. The influence of the reduction temperature has also been studied. The values of the activities and selectivities in the hydrogenolysis of butane on Ni-Rh catalysts after reduction at 700 and 900 are reported in Table 2, from which it can be seen that the rates of hydrogenolysis decrease when the reduction temperature increases. However, these rates decrease to different extent, depending on the composition of the catalysts. The pure metals -- rhodium and nickel -- are the most strongly affected by reduction at 700. Then, when the percentage of nickel in the catalyst is increased, the activity of the catalyst appears to be less and less lowered by reduction at 700. G.

It must be pointed out that an increase of the reduction temperature has a greater effect on the activity of the catalyst in butane hydrogenolysis than on its ability of chemisorbing hydrogen. For the only three catalysts which have been characterized by chemisorption, the H/metal ratios decreased only by a factor of 2, 1.5 and 0.83 for NR 2-100, 2-80 and 2-0 respectively, whereas their activities decreased by a factor of 23.4, 7.5 and 12, respectively. Hence, the decrease in activity does not seem to be due only to the sintering of the metals. However the H/metal ratio is only related to the total dispersion of nickel and rhodium and it does not give an indication as regards the individual dispersions of nickel on the one hand and of rhodium on the other hand. An attempt to calculate these individual dispersions was done for NR 2-80 reduced at 450 and 700, assuming that H/Nis -- 1 and H/ Rh~ = 1, by using the surface mole fraction of rhodium XRh which has been calculated in ref. [3] and was equal to 0.82 and 0.53 for NR 2-80 after reduction at 450 and 700, respectively: DNi = NiJNi and DRh = RhJRh, where Nk and Rh~ are the amounts of nickel and rhodium surface atoms in one gram of catalyst. The results are shown in Table 3. Hence, if the assumptions on which our calculations are based are correct, it seems that, after reduction at 700 of NR 2-80, all (or almost all) nickel atoms are on the surface, while the dispersion of rhodium is decreased by a factor 2 compared to the same catalyst reduced at 450. Table 3 NR 2-80 reduced at 450 and 700 C Nickel and rhodium dispersions of Dispersion Reduction temperature 450 700 DNi 0.57 0.97 Dl~ 0.71 0.31 166 G. Leclercq et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 101-172 This decrease in rhodium dispersion could account lbr the lower activity. How- ever the rhodium dispersion is only decreased by a factor of 2 whereas the activity is decreased by a factor of 7.5. Moreover, it must be mentioned that there does not seem to be a direct relation between the decrease in rhodium dispersion and that of the catalyst activities since a reduction at 700, compared to a reduction at 450, reduced the H/Rh ratios by a factor of about 2 and 1.5 for NR 2-100 and 2-80, respectively, whereas their activities are reduced by factors of 23 and 7.5, respec- tively. The fact that the activity of NR 2-80 is sensitive to the reduction temperature could be related to a higher dilution of active rhodium metal atoms by less active nickel atoms on the surface. However, in no case this could explain the considerable decrease in the activity of the pure rhodium catalyst NR 2-100, and this decrease is the most important one observed for the whole series of catalysts. Yates and Sinfeit [ 11 ] also reported variations of the activity of rhodium catalysts in the hydrogeno|ysis of ethane when the metal dispersion was varied. However, for 1, 5 and 10 weight-% Rh (with H/Rh of 0.94, 0.53 and 0.48, respectively) the activities expressed in moles of ethane hydrogenolyzed per m: of rhodium and per hour were 16, 12.2 and 13.5, respectively. This shows that for this range of disper- sions, which is the same as the one studied here (see Tables 1 and 2), the activity is not strongly affected by changes in metal dispersion. Hence this explanation does not seem to be very likely. There remains the possibility that poisoning occurs during reduction at higher temperature, caused by impurities from the support. Such a poisoning by sulphur coming from the support has already been mentioned [ 12]. If nickel is preferably poisoned by such impurities, then the lower sensitivity of bimetallic catalysts compared to monometallic nickel or rhodium catalysts can be explained, since in Ni-Rh catalysts the activity essentially comes from rhodium. Here it must be pointed out that no sulphur has been detected by XPS [3]. However the lower limit of detection of sulphur on our spectrometer is about 0.1 wt.-%; this would correspond to a coverage of about 10% of the rhodium atoms by sulphur for the rhodium catalyst NR 2-100. Hence, if less than one tenth of the rhodium were covered by sulphur, this would not be detectable by XPS, and such a low coverage of the metal surface by poison atoms could have a large influence on the activity of the catalyst in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes, which is a structure sensitive reaction. As a matter of fact, it has been shown that sulphur could have a very high toxicity for the hydrogenolysis of ethane on platinum [12]. Similarly, Cogen and Maier [ 13] have found that an amount of carbon equivalent to 0.17 monolayer was sufficient to lower by 82% the activity of a Rh/A1203 catalyst for H/D exchange. Of course, an impurity other than sulphur could also act as a poison, or, as often mentioned, although rarely with alumina as a support [ 14], a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect [ 15,16] could occur after reduction at 700. This effect is known for lowering the activity [ 15,16]. If this SMSI acts more on nickel than on rhodium, this could explain the smaller effect of a higher reduction temperature on bimetallic catalysts. Similar phenomena have been observed after reduction of the catalysts at 900. G. Leclercq et al./Applied Catalysis A: General I23 (1995) 161-172 3.2. Selectivities 167 Catalysts reduced at 450 Only hydrogenolysis has been observed on all catalysts under our experimental conditions ( T= 220, PHc = 0.1 atm, P~ = 0.9 atm). The molar methane/propane ratios produced in the reaction (Table 1 and 2) are all higher than 1 (between 1.1 and 1.6), indicating that multiple hydrogenolysis occurs but to a rather low extent. This ratio does not vary much with the catalyst composition. On the contrary, the Set values, representing the proportion of butane which reacted to give ethane (Table 1 ), vary strongly. First, it increases when the first percents of rhodium are added. Then it seems to level for about 40 to 50 atom percent of rhodium. At a first glance this does not seem surprising since rhodium gives a very high proportion of ethane, and since it is the most active of the two metals. The activity of the catalysts is essentially due to rhodium for the catalysts containing more than 40 atom-% of rhodium. Therefore these catalysts should exhibit selectivities very close to that of rhodium. However, Fig. 2 indicates for the two series of catalysts, NR 0.5-x and NR 2-x, the presence of maxima for Se, at about 70 to 80% rhodium. It is very surprising to note that when a metal giving a very selective hydrogenolysis of terminal bonds in alkanes (nickel) is added to another metal which leads prefer- entially to the splitting of internal bonds (rhodium), the proportion of ethane formed in the hydrogenolysis of butane is still increased, slightly but significantly. On the other hand, the comparison of curves (a) and (b) in Fig. 2 indicates that Se~ improves with increasing metal content. This is even true for rhodium alone (see Table 1 ). In order to analyze more precisely the influence of these two parameters we have computed the curves of isoselectivities as a function of two independent variables: the rhodium content in the catalyst (r, in weight percents) and the rhodium atomic percent (y = nRh/( nRh nt- nNi) ; Fig. 3 ) according to a method described in the Appen- dix. Obviously, the hydrogenolysis of butane is both structure (particle size) and Set 2 0,6, 0,4 q2 Y 0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 Fig. 2.

The agreement between experimental values and the computed isoselectivity curves is quite fair. Of course, extrapolation of these diagrams must be done with caution. However, this indicates that, for a constant rhodium content, the best selectivity to ethane for bimetallic catalysts will be obtained for nickel mole frac- tions of 0.25 to 0.30. The reasons for the influence of those two parameters on Set are not obvious. Yao et al. [2,17] have reported an influence of the rhodium content in Rh/A1203 catalysts on the selectivity in n-pentane hydrogenolysis. For rhodium contents between 0.34 and 3.66 wt.-% the selectivity remained almost constant, with ethane and propane as the main products, but from 5.51 to 12.4 wt.-% the proportion of internal bond splitting decreased notablyThese results were explained on the basis of the formation of two phases for rhodium: ( 1 ) a two-dimensional dispersed phase splitting pentane predominantly to ethane and propane, and (2) three-dimensional particles upon which the rate of the hydrogenolysis of internal bonds decreased. First, our results seem to contradict those of Yao et al. [ 2,17 ], since we have found that Se, is improved by high rhodium loadings up to 5 wt.-% of rhodium. However, it must be pointed out that Yao et al. used a support with a specific surface area of 150 m2/g. This corresponds to a rhodium saturated concentration corresponding to a monolayer of rhodium on the support of 3.86 wt.-%. With our support (BET surface area 200 m2/g) this saturation concentration would be 5.15 wt.-%. There- G. Leclercq et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 161-172 169 fore there is no contradiction between our results and those of Yao et al., and Set should go through a maximum for about 5 wt.-% of rhodium. However the expla- nation proposed by Yao et al. cannot account for the increased selectivity for the formation of ethane when the rhodium content is increased. Coq and co-workers [ 18,19] explain the variations of the activities and selectiv- ities of supported rhodium-containing catalysts in the hydrogenolysis of hydrocar- bons by the existence of two types of active sites. The first type contains low-coordination rhodium atoms ('kink atoms'), the other one is composed of high-coordination rhodium atoms, like in the planes ( 111 ) or (100). Normally, an increase of rhodium dispersion, e.g. by a decrease of the metal content, tends to favour the first type of sites, while in the low-dispersion catalysts, and particularly on rhodium blacks and foils, the second type is dominating. In the experiments of Coq et al. [ 19] made with bimetallic Rh-Cu silica sup- ported catalysts, the metal particle sizes did not vary much whatever the rhodium and copper contents. To explain the selectivity variation, a 'topological segregation' of copper was postulated, i.e. a substitution of the low-coordinated rhodium atoms on the surface by copper atoms, in addition to the theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed segregation of copper on the surface. In the case of the Ni-Rh catalysts studied here, the same mechanism could operate. First, as already said, in the catalysts with low nickel content, almost all catalytic activity can be attributed to rhodium active sites, while the nickel atoms mostly act as diluent, like the copper atoms in ref. [ 19]. Secondly, the addition of nickel to rhodium provokes a decrease of the total metal dispersion, as can be seen by comparing the H/metal ratios for the catalysts NR 2-100 (0.97), NR 2-80 (0.68) and NR 2-0 (0.1 i ) reduced at 450. This decrease in dispersion should be associated with an increase of the size of the metal crystallites and a decrease of the number of kinks and steps on their surfaces. At least, we have shown that nickel, like copper, has a tendency to segregate from its alloys with rhodium [3] -- therefore, even if the quantitative nickel surface enrichment seems absent in the catalysts NR 2-80 and NR 0.5-40 reduced at 450, because of the high dispersion of the active phases, the 'topological' nickel segregation may still be possible, leading to a further decrease of the number of the low-coordinated rhodium atoms. Adding nickel to rhodium would have two consequences: a decrease of the number of active sites due to the dilution of very active rhodium atoms by nickel atoms (decrease of activity), and a decrease of the number of low-coordinated rhodium atoms in the active sites themselves; therefore an influence on the selec- tivity opposite to that corresponding to an increase of the dispersion. The hydrocarbons studied by Coq and co-workers [ 18,19] did not include n- butane. Therefore it is not a priori evident that the differences in the product distribution observed by these authors can be extended to this alkane. Some argu- ments may be found in a work by Cogan and Maier [ 13]. In that study the H/D exchange in n-hexane and some other hydrocarbons was studied on a series of rhodium catalysts with varying dispersions. The distribution of deuterium atoms in 170 G. Leclercq et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 161-172 exchanged molecules and the determination of the relative positions of these atoms in dz hexane molecules have shown that on the highly dispersed catalysts, only one C-H bond in the molecule is activated, while on the low-dispersion catalysts a simultaneous activation of two adjacent C-H bonds occurs. Moreover, in the second case the activation seemed most probable for pairs of methylene groups (and not for methyl-methylene pairs). It seems plausible to see in the first process, a single C-H bond activation, the first step of a terminal bond splitting, while the second process could lead to splitting of the central bond in a butane molecule. Catalysts reduced at 700 and 900 For most of the bimetallic Ni-Rh catalysts, Set is lowered by an increase in the reduction temperature, and the promotional effect of adding nickel to rhodium seems to be attenuated or suppressed for catalysts reduced at 700 and 900. These effects could be attributed to an enhanced nickel segregation (in the experiments of Coq et al., at high contents, the diluting metal had an effect on the selectivity opposite to that obtained at low contents), to a decrease of rhodium dispersion as proposed by Yao et al. [2,17] or to SMSI. Here we want to point out that NR 2-80 reduced at 700 has almost the same selectivity in the hydrogenolysis of butane as NR 2-40 reduced at 450. It has also a similar activity. These observations could be related to the fact that, in the first paper of this series [3], the surface composition of NR 2-80 reduced at 700 has been estimated, from chemisorption measurements, to be about 47% of nickel and 53% of rhodium, or 60% of nickel and 40% of rhodium (using two different hypotheses for the stoichiometry of oxygen and hydrogen chemisorption), which is close to the bulk composition of NR 2-40. However this is too peculiar a result to be generalized, but it shows that the influence of the reduction temperature on bimetallic Ni-Rh catalysts could also -- at least partially-- be attributed to changes in the surface composition by nickel enrichment. 4. Conclusion This study has shown that the incorporation of nickel into rhodium catalysts strongly lowers the activity of these catalysts for butane hydrogenolysis, but addi- tion of small amounts of nickel (up to about 30%), a metal which, taken alone, leads to almost only hydrogenolysis of terminal bonds in alkanes, definitely improves the selectivity for ethane formation of rhodium. This was an unexpected result, important also for practical reasons, since it can be interesting to selectively transform butane to ethane. The selectivity for ethane formation can also be increased by increasing the metal content of Ni-Rh catalysts. G. Leclercq et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 161-172 Appendix 1 171 Isoselectivity curves The curves in Fig. 3 correspond to constant values of the selectivity for ethane formation, Sot. They have been obtained from experimental data Set (composition) given here by a linear least squares procedure [ 20]. First of all, a number of equations with differently expressed composition were tried; the best independent variables were found to be the rhodium content r (in ktmol/g of catalyst), and the rhodium mole fraction in the total metal, y. The obvious mathematical property of Set, viz. 0~Set~ 1 (A1) was imposed by using In( 1 - Set) rather than Set itself. This expression was repre- sented as a linear combination of terms containing r and y, the highest degree being set equal to 3. The final equation is of the form In( 1 - Set) = ao + air+ a2y + a3r2 q- a4ry q- asy2 + a6ry2 q- a7y3 (A2) The coefficients ao, al ..... a7 have been obtained in the usual way by minimizing the function: F(ao,a~ ..... av)=S{[1/(l-S~e[))2][ln(1-S~))-f(?i),y~i)]2} (A3) where r{i), y~i) and Se~) are ith experimental values of r, y and Set respectively, and fir,y) is the expression on the right-hand side of Eq. (A2). The weight factor 1/ (1- Set)2 was introduced to obtain the values of ao, al ..... a7 that minimize the sum of squared errors of Set rather than that of ln( 1 - Set). It is evident that the Eq. (A2) is an empirical one, not based on any model and should be used cautiously. Nevertheless, it represents fairly well the behaviour of Set within the domain where the experimental points are situated. References [ 1 ] G. Leclercq, L. Leclercq, L.M. Bouleau, S. Pietrzyk and R.

Bimetallic NiRhγ-Al2O3 catalysts with various total metal contents and nickel mole fractions have been used in n-butane hydrogenolysis. Both the total reaction rate and the selectivity for ethane formation are strongly influenced by the two parameters as well as by the reduction temperature. Rather unexpectedly, an addition of small quantities of nickel to Rh/γ-Al2O3 catalysts increases their ability for central CC bond rupture, in spite of the tendency of this metal to split terminal bonds in hydrocarbons.
