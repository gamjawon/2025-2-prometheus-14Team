Box 1033 Blindern, N-0315 Oslo, Norway Received 19 June 1995; revised 28 August 1995; accepted 8 November 1995 Abstract The isobutane/2-butene alkylation has been catalysed by acidic cubic faujasites (H-FAU and CeY-98) and a hexagonal faujasite (H-EMT) in a semibatch slurry reactor. H-EMT exhibited the best results during the reaction with respect to an improved deactivation profile and moderate loss of alkylate selectivity compared to both CeY-98 and H-FAU. Additionally, H-EMT proved to be regenerable. The different catalytic behaviour between H-EMT and H-FAU has been discussed in terms of differences in their crystal structure. Furthermore, we have focused on the influence of isobutane:2-butene molar ratio and temperature (simultaneously varied) on the catalytic behaviour at constant butene WHSV fed to the slurry reactor at optimum stirring conditions. CeY-98 was used as a model catalyst and the results were treated statistically by principal component and partial least square analyses. The dependence of alkylate selectivity as well as yield related to temperature (T) and isobutane:2-butene molar ratio (M) were found to be: Selectivity = 0.53 + 0.017 [M- 12.5] + 0.0003 IT- 90] + 0.0004 [T- 90] [M- 12.5]; Yield = 0.55 + 0.016 [M- 12.5] + 0.001 [T- 90] + 0.0004 [T- 90] [M- 12.5], within the employed parameters (T~ 80-100, M ~ 5-20). Both equations showed optima at low butene concentrations, while the temperature was of minor importance. A high stirring speed was essential to achieve optimal reaction conditions enlarging the alkylate yield and selectivity.

Introduction Alkylation of isobutane with an olefin giving branched, high octane paraffins is an important refinery process for production of reformulated gasoline. In 1994, about 925 000 barrels (15000 m3) of alkylate were produced per day in the US. This represents 90% of today's total capacity, which is expected to expand by 10%-35% to meet the estimated demand in 1998 [1]. The develop- ment of new processes is stimulated by large inventories of the environmental hazardous sulphuric or hydrofluoric acid and the high catalyst costs [2,3]. Comprehensive research has focused on new potential heterogeneous catalyst systems like zeolites [4-15], sulphate-promoted metal oxides [ 16-18], sulphated acid resins [16,19] and solid superacids supported on inorganic carriers [16]. Most of these alternatives undergo rapid deactivation and loss of alkylate selectivity, demanding frequent regeneration. There has been some progress in the field towards commercialisation resulting in pilot-plant studies employing antimony pentafluoride, aluminium/zirconium halides and trichloromethane sulphuric acid on silica catalysts [1]. However, these systems still contain environmentally hazardous components. Presently, no unpromoted zeolites are ready for industrial alkylation. The zeolites commonly studied for isobutane/butene alkylation include cubic faujasites [5-9,20], zeolite /3 [10,21,22] MCM-36 [12], MCM-22 [10,11,23], ZSM-4 [13] and pentasil type zeolites [4]. Rapid loss of selectivity led to formation of octenes instead of octanes under the given experimental conditions. Recently, we investigated the alkylation activity of the hexagonal faujasite, H-EMT, together with the cubic faujasites FAU and CeY-98 [14]. Screening results after 3 h in a slurry reactor showed EMT as the better alkylation catalyst, the activity being high and the formation of isooctenes being surprisingly low. Therefore, it is now important to investigate the development during the time of reaction in order to understand the differences in the catalytic behaviour of these zeolites. Additionally, the regenerability of EMT is essential if the catalyst should be of any commercial interest. The experimental reaction conditions are vital to achieve an optimum catalyst performance. This is exemplified in a patent by Shell [22], where the switching between recycling reactor systems determined the activity of zeolite /3. Many papers deal with the effect of isobutane:butene molar ratio by changing the WHSV (weight hourly space velocity, g butene charged/g catalyst per h) and/or temperature [4,6,20,23] mostly using integral plug flow reactors. In this work, we would like to focus on the effect of isobutane:2-butene molar ratio and temperature at constant WHSV in a slurry reactor at optimum stirring condi- tions. The scope is to study the dependence of the different results on simultane- ous variation of molar ratio and temperature and covariance in the product distribution by using simple statistics. T. Rcrvik et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 235-253 237 2. Experimental 2.1. Reactor set-up Isobutane/2-butene alkylation experiments were carried out in a semibatch reactor system to achieve a realistic measure of the catalysts alkylation ability and deactivation (see Fig. 1). A 300 ml stainless steel stirred autoclave was equipped with three valves (one inlet valve and two outlet valves for both gas and liquid). The temperature was monitored by a PID temperature controller and the data were recorded on a connected PC together with pressure ratings during the reaction. A four-blade, downward-thrust impeller provided positive agitation with speeds ranging from 0 to 1200 rpm. TGA (thermogravimetric analyses) measurements were performed before weighing and drying of the zeolites in a calcination oven (2 h, 400 in air) in order to determine the moisture content. The dried catalyst was placed inside the reactor for two h at 200 in nitrogen. The reactor was filled with isobutane (99.95% purity) under nitrogen pressure and the mixture heated to the reaction temperature. 2-Butene was charged at constant WHSV for two h. Reactants were fed at 2 by a cooled ISCO positive displacement syringe pump operated under pressure at constant flow rate, with an accuracy of _+ 0.5%. 2.2.

Samples were collected from the bottom of the reactor through a dip tube equipped with a filter (0.5 p~m). The dip tube was flushed in advance with nitrogen to ensure representative sampling. A 0.1 /zm filter was placed in the reactor outlet (see Fig. 1) to separate finely dispersed catalyst particles from the liquid (particles with a size around 1 /zm). Samples were thoroughly sucked to fill the transparent tubes keeping the desired high pressure. The method made it possible to trap 100% liquid phase inside the transparent tubes and the injection GC valve. 0.2 /zl could be injected directly to an on-line GC for light component analyses (~< C6). The on-line GC was equipped with a back flushing valve shortening the time required to detect the light components down to 20 min. Excess liquid was collected in ice-cooled traps filled with carbondisulphide for solution of the hydrocarbons. The solutions were kept on septum vials and injected to an off-line GC for analysis of heavy components (>/C6). 2,3-di- methyl-butane was used to standardise the product distribution from both GC runs. The off-line GC was equipped with a split after the column, one line leading through an olefin adsorbent (trap with mercuric perchlorate packing) with a separate detector to differentiate between olefin and paraffin peaks and, thereby, detecting any overlap. Both GCs were equipped with capillary columns from Hewlett Packard (HP PNA 50 m 0.22 mm, i.d. 0.5 /zm, methyl silicone gum fused silica), flame ionisation detectors, helium carrier gas and adjustable injector splits towards ventilation to prevent saturation of peaks. T. ROrvik et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 235-253 239 For complete identification of all chromatographic peaks, a sample was analysed by SI-PIONA (paraffins, isoparaffins, olefins, naphthenes, aromatics) [24]. The SI-PIONA is especially developed for detailed analyses of the hydrocarbon contents of gasoline and is performed on a Finnigan SSQ 700 mass spectrometer connected to a Varian 3400 GC (100 m Petrocol DH column, 0.50 /xm film, 0.25 mm id), The sample (an evaporated sample from a CeY-98 run) contained all together 170 compounds and gave a proper identification of the lighter components including isooctanes. Isooctenes and heavier products were grouped in C8 mono-olefins, C9 mono-olefins, C9 isoparaffins, etc. These results, together with the off-line GC olefin splitting facility, made it possible to carefully identify the products in all sample analyses. No attempt was made to separate between olefins and paraffins and differentiate the isomers above C8. About 2 wt.-% of isobutane and butenes were estimated to be in the gas phase when the reactor was filled and the amount of product in gas phase was negligible (based on calculations). This was confirmed by pressure measure- ments during the experiments. When sampling, the liquid loss was evaluated to 0.5 g per sample. Both the amount of gas phase reactants and the weight loss, when sampling, were considered determining the total mass balance. Theoretical error estimations of the experimental results were based on the propagation of errors in the entire alkylation equipment. The results of these calculations are consistent with results from a reproduced experiment, showing that the total amount of liquid in the reactor (g), the butene charged (g), alkylate yield (g C5-C8 isoparaffins) and butene analysed in liquid phase (g) had an error of + 2%. The uncertainties considering the amount of butene converted (g) and the yield (g alkylate/g butene charged) were _+6% and +8% for the selectivity (g alkylate/g butene converted). 2.3. Catalyst preparation and characterisation A commercial Y zeolite (Aldrich) was 98% ion exchanged with Ce (named CeY-98), applying a procedure reported by Weitkamp [25]. The zeolite was used both as a reference and a model catalyst. H-EMT and H-FAU were synthesised according to modified procedures given by Delprato et al. [26], using 18-crown-6 and 15-crown-5 as templates, respectively. The pure crystals of EMT and FAU were ion exchanged with ammonium (2 M solution of NH4NO3, 70, 3 3 h) and calcined in air (540, 5 h) to achieve the acidic forms. The catalysts were characterised by XRD, microprobe, e9si MAS NMR, BET, SEM and pore volume measurements [14]. TPD measurements were carried out on an AMI-1 instrument (Altamira Instruments Inc.) which was controlled by a Hyundai PC-AT. TPD of ammonia was performed according to the following procedure with 200 mg catalyst of particle size 35-70 mesh: Pre-treatment with 30 ml/min He flow up to 600 and saturation of the catalyst surface with 30 ml/min 10% ammonia in a He 240 1\". ROrvik et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 235-253 flow at 200. TPD was carried out with 30 ml/min He flow using the following temperature profile: 200 in 30 min, increasing the temperature from 200 to 600 with 20/min and then standby for 15 min at 600, cooling to 100 and calibration of the TCD by sending 7 pulses of 5 ml ammonia. 2.4. Regeneration Deactivated H-EMT from two similar runs were mixed together and regener- ated in air by carefully increasing the temperature to avoid a collapse of the structure. The temperature program was set to : 5/rain from room tempera- ture to 300, 2/min further to 400, kept at 400 for 60 min, 2/min up to 450, kept at 450 for 30 min, 2/min up to 600 and kept at 600 for 10 h. XRD was used to confirm the crystallinity after the regeneration. 2.5. Screening experiments at standard conditions Screening experiments on CeY, H-FAU, H-EMT and the regenerated H-EMT were carried out at 80 with a WHSV between 1.2 and 1.3 h-1 (charging of butene was stopped after two h) and the pressure ranging from 1.97 to 2.26 MPa. About 5 g of dry catalyst was used and the reactor stirred at 360 rpm. Liquid samples were withdrawn every 30 min and analysed. 2.6. Effects of operating conditions A series of experiments were performed with CeY-98 as a model catalyst to evaluate the effects of operating conditions on the test results. First, the influence of increasing the stirring speed from 250 to 1200 rpm was investi- gated. Second, a simple 22-statistical design with simultaneous variation of the overall isobutane:butene ratio from 5:1 ( - 1) to 20:1 ( + 1) and temperature from 80 ( - 1) to 100 ( + 1) was carried out (see Table 2). The WHSV and the stirring speed were at a constant level of 1.3 and 1200 rpm, respectively. The WHSV was kept constant by varying the amount of catalyst used together with the applied charging velocity of butene. 2.7. Statistical treatment of the data A software for multivariate data analyses was used to evaluate the effects of operating conditions [27]. The experimental data can be divided into two data blocks, one X- and one Y-matrix. The X-matrix represents the design matrix with the different applied temperatures (T) and molar ratios (M) applied arranged in a 22-factorial design (illustrated by Table 2) [28]. Obtained results (or responses) like selectivity, yield, isooctane distribution span the Y-matrix. PCA (principal component analyses) is used to extract the systematic varia- T. Rcrvik et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 235-253 241 tion in only one set of data, whereas PLS (partial least squares regression) decompose one data matrix to achieve the best explanation of another matrix [29]. The methods treat variables through projection of the information down to a low-dimensional subspace of a few latent variables. These latent variables, so called principal components (PC), span the new coordinate axes pointing in the direction of the largest variations. Therefore, the subspace contains the most relevant information in the set of data. The coordinates of the different experi- ments on the principal components are called scores and can be represented as score plots, whereas the loading plot shows the corresponding relationship between the original variables and the PCs [27]. PLS can be used to evaluate the relationship between the applied operating conditions and the results, giving a calibration model of the form: Y= boT + blM + b2(Tm) where b's are regression coefficients and 1y is the estimated response [28]. A validation of the model can be performed with leverage correction when dealing with a factorial design. Leverage correction is an internal validation method in the sense that it uses all objects (experiments) for both modelling and validation. It is not as rigorous as other validation methods like cross validation. However, the latter method can not be used in an orthogonal design like this. The predicted errors of the models in this work are given as percent explained variance (mean square error). 3. Results 3.1. Screening of catalyst systems at standard conditions The overall screening results after 3 h of reaction are summarised in Table 1. H-EMT converted the highest amount of 2-butene (wt.-%) compared to both CeY-98 and H-FAU, CeY-98 resulting in only 33.6% conversion. At this stage of reaction, the total turnover numbers (mol of 2-butene converted per tool active sites) were found to be 15, 16 and 19 for CeY-98, H-FAU and H-EMT, respectively. However, the corresponding turnover numbers after only 1 h of reaction were 12 (CeY-98), 11 (H-FAU) and 10 (H-EMT), showing that H-EMT exhibited the highest activity the next two h. The calculations of the number of acid sites on the catalysts were based on the NH3 TPD measurements and the figures were 2.0 on H-EMT, 1.8 on H-FAU and 1.0 mmol/g on CeY-98, respectively. The estimates were based on ideal conditions, i.e., all acidic sites were active and accessible for reaction. H-EMT seemed to contain a slightly larger total amount of stronger acidic sites than H-FAU comparing the acid strength distribution given by the NH3 TPD curves. However, such measure- ments should be used with care because the results could be affected by factors 242 T.

Fig. 5 shows that the relative distribution of TMPs (normalised) formed on the different catalysts after 3 h were quite similar. The selectivity in the competitive reactions alkylation/oligomerization, was found to be particularly favourable on H-EMT with only 4 wt.-% isooctenes in the C8 product after 3 h of reaction (Table 1). The normalised amount (wt.-%) of heavier products, i.e., isooctanes, isooctenes and larger molecules (C9+ isoparaffins and olefins) formed by H-EMT, CeY-98 and H-FAU are given in Fig. 6a, Fig. 6b and Fig. 6c. Fig. 6a shows that H-EMT produces very little isooctenes, even up to 5 h time of reaction. The deactivation was very slow, with only a slight selectivity change producing more C9+. CeY-98 (Fig. 6b) produced initially much isooctanes, but this fraction decreased rapidly with the reaction time in favour of isooctenes together with a gradual formation of C9+. H-FAU (Fig. 6c) formed a substantial amount of heavy products in the first stage of reaction. However, the selectivity loss towards isooctenes was much lower compared to CeY-98. 3.2. Effect of the operation conditions 3.2.1. Stirring speed Enhancing the stirring speed from 250 to 360 rpm greatly affected the product distribution towards less 2,2,4-TMP and demonstrated the importance of screen- ing catalysts at the same stirring speed. An additional increase of the speed to 1200 rpm (real maximum limited by design) gave similar isooctane distribution, but enlarged the yield and the selectivity towards alkylation. 3.2.2. Effect of temperature and molar ratio In Table 2, the results after 3 h reaction operated at various temperatures (80-100) and isobutane:butene molar ratios (5:1-20:1) are summarised. Increasing the temperature resulted in more 2-butene converted (wt.-%), while the alkylate selectivity (g alkylate/g 2-butene converted) and yield (g alkylate/g catalyst) showed an optimum at an isobutane:butene molar ratio of 20:1, quite independently of the temperature. Both the TMP:DMHx ratio and the total fraction of 2,3,4- and 2,3,3-TMP were increased by higher molar ratios contra- dictory to 3,4-DMHx. 2,4- and 2,3-DMHx exhibited a dependency on tempera- ture, having optima in the higher temperature region. Additionally, the ratio (2,2,3-+ 2,2,4-TMP):(2,3,4-+ 2,3,3-TMP) was generally higher at 100. This expression describes the ratio of the slowest and the fastest diffusing TMPs [6]. Fig. 6.

The data in Table 2 were treated statistically by PLS to achieve a model for each of the result parameters as a function of the variables. Before calibration, the data were standardised (weighted) by the inverse of the absolute noise standard deviation (1/o'). The alkylate yield and selectivity were the only responses giving a satisfactory explained variance above 60%. It was found that an increase in the isobutane:2-butene molar ratio (M) greatly enlarged the alkylate selectivity, while the changes in temperature had hardly no influence. The relation found using one optimal principal component (PC) is given by Eq.

Rervik et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 235-253 247 ters. The yield was to a larger extent dependent on the temperature (T, ) and the model using one PC (optimal) can be described by Eq. (2), Yield = 0.55 + 0.016[ M- 12.5] + 0.001[T- 90] + 0.0004IT- 901[ M- 12.5] (2) having an explained variance of 75%.

Choosing a confidence interval of 95%, the correlation had to be at a minimum of +_ 0.83 to be significant [30]. The most interesting results from this computa- tion was the high positive correlation between the alkylate selectivity and yield (0.95).

A PCA modelling of the internal isooctane distribution gave score and loading plots represented by Fig. 7a and Fig. 7b, respectively. The two principal components explained 87% of the variation in the set of data in total. Fig. 7b shows that 3,4-DMHx was dependent on different parameters than 2,4- and 2,3-DMHx, lying in another part of the diagram. It can be seen from Fig. 7a that 3,4-DMHx has coordinates in the area of experiment hr. 2 with temperature of 80 and a molar ratio of 5:1. 2,4- and 2,3-DMHx obviously lye in the high temperature area, but at mixed molar ratios. Considering the TMPs, 2,3,3-TMP corresponds to the low temperature and high molar ratio operating conditions. 2,3,4-, 2,2,3- and 2,2,4-TMP correlates closely and are not significantly separa- ble. They probably depend on higher temperatures than 2,3,3-TMP. The fraction of 2-methyl-3-ethylpentane (2M3EP) was not considered due to small peaks on the GC chromatograms and, therefore, being too uncertain with respect to integrations (see Table 2). 3.3. Regeneration of catalyst H-EMT lost some crystallinity during regeneration indicated by a decrease in relative peak height and broadening in the XRD. The general screening results in Table 1 demonstrate a lowering of selectivity and activity and a slightly lower conversion of 2-butene. However, the TMP:DMHx ratio, isooctene formation and the alkylate distribution are quite similar. The development of TMP:DMHx ratio and the catalyst deactivation profile was about the same as for the fresh catalyst. 4. Discussion A slurry reactor provides good control of mixing conditions and eliminates intrareactor gradients like temperature and concentration compared to fixed bed reactors. Ideally, the streaming surroundings result in an uniform deactivation of the catalyst crystals, unlike the coke profile associated with deactivation in a fixed bed reactor causing activity variations in the catalyst bed. Further develop- ment of the reactor set-up towards a CSTR operation would, however, give more detailed knowledge on alkylation and ease the sampling compared to the simplified semibatch operation. 4.1. Optimisation of test conditions The optimisation experiments were performed with a fixed WHSV, eliminat- ing concentration effects other than the changes in the total isobutane:butene 250 7\". Rorvik et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 235-253 molar ratio. The PLS models for alkylate selectivity and yield were the only ones explaining more than 60% of the variance in the data (Eqs. (1) and (2)). However, it is possible to observe trends in the remaining results. Eq. (2) describes the catalyst alkylation activity (expressed in yield per g catalyst) depending on the applied molar ratio (5:1-20:1) and temperature (80-100). The temperature raise had little effect on the yield compared to an increase in molar ratio, even though a slightly higher conversion of 2-butene was obtained (Table 2). Together with a high isobutane:butene molar ratio, an increase in the stirring speed enhanced the alkylate yield. These findings indicate that a high dispersion of low butene concentrations under perfect mixing was most important to suppress butene oligomerization and to maintain a high activity towards alkylation. However, the catalyst total activity expressed as butene converted per g of catalyst was not influenced by the molar ratio. This can be deduced from the similar values of alkylate yield (g alkylate/g catalyst) and selectivity (g alkylate/g butene converted) given in Table 2 and their high correlation. As given in Eq. (1), the alkylate selectivity depended mostly on the molar ratio of isobutane:2-butene. Similar trends (although not as significant) were observed with the TMP:DMHx molar ratio, TMP being preferred at lower butene concentrations. Additionally, the fraction of olefins and heavier products (C9+) decreased with increased molar ratio (20:1) compared with the standard testing conditions at 10:1. Cardona et al. [15] deduced from material balance that C9+ products (and C5-C7 product) result mainly from the transformation of butene alone. Thus, when a lower level of butene is available, less C9+ product are formed which is in accordance with our data. The variation of reaction temperature had little effect on catalyst selectivity in general, but led to small changes in the TMP distribution. The work of Ghrdos et al. [20] shows total altering of the TMP distribution raising the temperatures slightly at an extemal molar ratio of 8 in a batch reactor with a RE exchanged Y catalyst. This was not observed in our experiments with a CeY-98 catalyst, the stirring speed being the only factor significantly affecting the distribution of TMPs by decreasing the fraction of 2,2,4-TMP. Cardona et al. [15] proposed that self alkylation of isobutane plays a significant role in the transformation of the isobutane-alkene mixtures. This was demonstrated by the rapid formation of octane products (mainly 2,2,4-TMP) from the isobutane-propene mixture and by the hydrogen balance for the transformation of the isobutane-butene mixture [15]. Thus, the improved dispersion of butene in isobutane, caused by an increase in stirring speed, may reduce the degree of 2,2,4-TMP formed by self-alkylation of isobutane. 3,4-DMHx seemed to be a key isomer in the zeolite catalysed isobutane/2- butene alkylation. 3,4-DMHx differed significantly from all other isooctanes, both TMPs and DMHxs (Fig. 7b) and correlated strongly with the distribution of C~, C9+ and C8 (Table 3). These findings suggest that an increase in the T. Rorvik et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 235-253 251 3,4-DMHx level in the reactor together with an increasing amount of oletins and heavier products is an indication of the stage of catalyst deactivation. A low isobutane:2-butene molar ratio gave the highest fraction of 3,4-DMHx, suggest- ing that 3,4-DMHx is a product formed by dimerization of butene. From the fact that the hydride shift is faster than the methyl shift, 3,4-DMHx is favoured compared to thermodynamic equilibrium of the DMHxs [15]. In an active catalyst, the 3,4-DMHxe carbenium ion is expected to isomerise to 2,4- and 2,3-DMHx. However, after catalyst deactivation, further isomerisation is limited resulting in an increasing amount of the 3,4-DMHx in the liquid product and a total decrease in the TMP:DMHx ratio (Fig. 4). This is also found by the work of Chu and Chester [6]. The amount of 3,4-DMHx increased with time in the alkylation over the polymeric Nation-H, but the polymer still showed an overall higher ability to isomerise the 3,4-DMHx carbenium ion, after severe deactiva- tion [ 19]. 4.2. Differences in the faujasites tested CeY-98 rapidly lost its alkylation selectivity in the semibatch reactor system similar to the observations done by Weitkamp [5] in a plug flow reactor. However, H-EMT showed a superior deactivation profile with a high lifetime compared to the other catalysts screened, producing least heavy products and olefins. Although H-EMT and H-FAU have quite similar geometrical pore sizes, low Si:A1 ratios and almost similar acid sites strength, the hexagonal faujasite has a second type of slightly larger supercage compared to the uniform size of supercages in the cubic FAU system [14]. Additionally, the structure of EMT is more accessible from the fact that the slightly larger supercage can be entered through five 12-membered oxygen windows compared to the four entrances of the FAU supercage and even more important, the entrance to the EMT su- percage goes through a straight channel. In fixed bed reactor systems, the faujasites resulted in high selectivities and conversions (up to 100%), but the product quality changed rapidly the first minutes [5,7]. Consequently, the differences in catalytic behaviour of H-FAU and H-EMT depends mostly on the rate of alkylate selectivity loss. The results showed that the zeolite with the highest pore volume and slightly lager and more accessible supercage (H-EMT) produced the largest amount of alkylate and was by far the most active. H-EMT favoured the alkylation reaction over the dimerization of butene for a longer period of time compared to H-FAU, illustrated by the high TMP:DMHx ratio profile (Fig. 4). H-EMT also demon- strated a high alkylation to oligomerization ratio controlled by a large hydride transfer capacity deduced from the low formation of olefinic compounds and cracked C5-C7 product. The differences in catalyst structure between H-FAU and the more open H-EMT may cause altering of the adsorption and desorption abilities of the catalysts, which influence on the alkylation activity. Stach et al. 252 T. Rorvik et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 235-253 [31] claimed that the pore structure and the intensity of the electrostatic field were the most important properties of the zeolite during adsorption. Overlapping of van der Waals and electrostatic forces in such small cavities was found to strengthen the energetic interaction of the adsorbed molecules with the solid phase. In addition, an open structure can better expose the acidic sites accessible for alkylation (those surrounding the supercages) and ease the diffusion of products out of the catalyst. EMT lost some activity and selectivity upon regeneration. This can be deduced from the slight decrease in relative XRD peak intensity observed after regeneration, and might be avoided by regeneration under milder conditions with lower maximum temperature. 5. Conclusions H-EMT demonstrated the best catalyst performance during alkylation of isobutane with 2-butene in a slurry reactor compared to both CeY-98 and H-FAU. The catalyst was regenerable and had high selectivity towards alkyla- tion with an improved deactivation profile. The differences between the hexago- nal and cubic faujasites were related to structural differences which resulted in a high hydride transfer capacity on H-EMT and, by this, avoiding the oligomeriza- tion reaction. The dependence of alkylate selectivity and yield on temperature (T) and isobutane:2-butene molar ratio (M), were found to be for CeY-98: Selectivity = 0.53 + 0.017[M- 12.5] + 0.0003[T- 90] + 0.0004[T-90] [ M- 12.5] Yield = 0.55 + 0.016[M - 12.5] + 0.001 [T- 90] + 0.0004[T - 901[M - 12.51 where T ~ [80-100], M ~ [5-20]. Additionally, a high stirring speed was essential to achieve optimal reaction conditions. The 3,4-DMHx level in the reactor was an indication of the stage of selectivity loss.

The isobutane/2-butene alkylation has been catalysed by acidic cubic faujasites (H-FAU and CeY-98) and a hexagonal faujasite (H-EMT) in a semibatch slurry reactor. H-EMT exhibited the best results during the reaction with respect to an improved deactivation profile and moderate loss of alkylate selectivity compared to both CeY-98 and H-FAU. Additionally, H-EMT proved to be regenerable. The different catalytic behaviour between H-EMT and H-FAU has been discussed in terms of differences in their crystal structure. Furthermore, we have focused on the influence of isobutane:2-butene molar ratio and temperature (simultaneously varied) on the catalytic behaviour at constant butene WHSV fed to the slurry reactor at optimum stirring conditions. CeY-98 was used as a model catalyst and the results were treated statistically by principal component and partial least square analyses. The dependence of alkylate selectivity as well as yield related to temperature (T) and isobutane:2-butene molar ratio (M) were found to be: Selectivity = 0.53 + 0.017 [M − 12.5] + 0.0003 [T − 90] + 0.0004 [T − 90] [M − 12.5]; Yield = 0.55 + 0.016 [M − 12.5] + 0.001 [T − 90] + 0.0004 [T − 90] [M − 12.5], within the employed parameters (T∈80–100°C, M∈5–20). Both equations showed optima at low butene concentrations, while the temperature was of minor importance. A high stirring speed was essential to achieve optimal reaction conditions enlarging the alkylate yield and selectivity.

        "dc:description": "The isobutane/2-butene alkylation has been catalysed by acidic cubic faujasites (H-FAU and CeY-98) and a hexagonal faujasite (H-EMT) in a semibatch slurry reactor. H-EMT exhibited the best results during the reaction with respect to an improved deactivation profile and moderate loss of alkylate selectivity compared to both CeY-98 and H-FAU. Additionally, H-EMT proved to be regenerable. The different catalytic behaviour between H-EMT and H-FAU has been discussed in terms of differences in their crystal structure. Furthermore, we have focused on the influence of isobutane:2-butene molar ratio and temperature (simultaneously varied) on the catalytic behaviour at constant butene WHSV fed to the slurry reactor at optimum stirring conditions. CeY-98 was used as a model catalyst and the results were treated statistically by principal component and partial least square analyses. The dependence of alkylate selectivity as well as yield related to temperature (T) and isobutane:2-butene molar ratio (M) were found to be: Selectivity = 0.53 + 0.017 [M − 12.5] + 0.0003 [T − 90] + 0.0004 [T − 90] [M − 12.5]; Yield = 0.55 + 0.016 [M − 12.5] + 0.001 [T − 90] + 0.0004 [T − 90] [M − 12.5], within the employed parameters (T∈80–100°C, M∈5–20). Both equations showed optima at low butene concentrations, while the temperature was of minor importance. A high stirring speed was essential to achieve optimal reaction conditions enlarging the alkylate yield and selectivity.",
