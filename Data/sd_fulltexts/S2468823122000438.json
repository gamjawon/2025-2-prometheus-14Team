Two cobalt-based ZSM-5 catalysts CoZ-IE and CoZ-IM were prepared by ion-exchange and incipient wetness impregnation method, respectively, and characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption, TEM, XPS, UV–vis, H2-TPR and Py-IR. The catalytic performance towards ethane conversion over the two catalysts in the presence of CO2 was compared. Despite of their similar textual properties and Co contents, the product distributions over the two catalysts were quite different. Ethylene with high selectivity of 95% formed over CoZ-IE while syngas was produced as the main product on CoZ-IM, indicating dry reforming becomes the dominant reaction pathway instead of dehydrogenation. The difference pathway can be ascribed to the different nature of Co species in two catalysts. The isolated Co2+ anchored at zeolitic framework in CoZ-IE is quite stable and can only act as Lewis acid sites for ethane dehydrogenation. In contrast, the cobalt oxides on the zeolitic surface in CoZ-IM can proceed oxidation-reduction cycles in the CO2-C2H6 system, facilitating the activation of CO2 and the scission of C−C bonds, leading to the dry reforming of ethane. Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract Keywords Dehydrogenation Dry reforming Ethane ZSM-5 Cobalt species 1 Introduction It is of great significance to convert light alkanes into high value-added chemicals, including isomerization, dehydrogenation, dehydroaromatization and reforming [1–4]. With the increasing demand for light alkenes, catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes has attracted an extensive attention [5,6]. Ethylene is one of the most important and versatile intermediates for chemical industry, from which a great number of high-value chemicals such as polyethylene, ethylene glycol, ethylene oxide, vinyl chloride and styrene can be manufactured. Numerous studies have been dedicated to the ethane dehydrogenation [7,8]. A rapid increase of anthropogenic CO2 in an atmosphere has been considered as the main cause of global warming. Developing an effective utilization method of CO2 is largely encouraged. A feasible approach is to transform the abundant CO2 into CO in partial oxidation reactions as a soft oxidant [9]. The tandem CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene is a potential way, since the reaction equilibrium can be shifted as a result of H2 consumption via reverse water-gas shift reaction (H2 + CO2 → H2O + CO), along with an enhanced catalyst stability due to the Boudouard reaction (C + CO2 → 2CO) [10–12]. Nonetheless, the dry reforming of ethane is supposed to take place simultaneously due to more thermodynamically favorable for C–C bond scission (377 kJ/mol) as compared with C–H bond cleavage (423 kJ/mol) [13]. The dehydrogenation process only concerns the activation of C-H bonds rather than C-C bonds in alkane while dry reforming is a distinct transformation pathway involved simultaneously the scission of C−C and C−H bonds [14]. Thus, it is critical to differentiate the two reaction pathways by selectively activation of C–H and C–C bonds in the conversion of ethane into high value-added chemicals. Cobalt based catalysts are cost-effective and environmentally friendly, which have been widely employed in the N2O decomposition, carbon monoxide oxidation, methane aromatization and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [15–18]. They have also exhibited promising activities for light alkane dehydrogenation [19,20]. C−H bonds are thought to be activated on isolated Co(II)−O bonds through the mechanism of 1,2-addition [21]. High selectivity to alkene can be obtained via dehydrogenation either in the absence or in the presence of CO2. Meanwhile, cobalt-based catalysts can also be used in dry reforming to produce syngas [22]. Cobalt-Al2O3 catalyst prepared by controlled adsorption method shows excellent activity for dry reforming of methane [23]. Highly dispersed Co deposits on aluminum along with the high support basicity are key to delivering an active and stable catalyst for the dry reforming. Isolated cobalt species anchored on the ceria surface are also an effective catalyst for dry reforming because of the redox properties of CeO2, to convert methane to syngas with less coke formation [14,24]. It can be inferred that predilection of the reaction pathway for cobalt-based catalyst are greatly influenced by the interaction between the support and CoO x species. However, details are still lacking on the nature difference between the active species for the two pathways. Cobalt-based ZSM-5 zeolites have been reported to be capable of C−H activation, indicating their promising catalytic applications in alkane dehydrogenation [25]. Various cobalt species can be generated in ZSM-5, including isolated cationic Co2+, CoO x clusters and Co3O4 nano particles, which mainly depend on the cobalt loading and the preparation methods [15,16,26]. Due to the lack of investigations over cobalt-based zeolites in ethane conversion in the presence of CO2, there is little understanding about the role of each Co species in breaking C−H bond to produce ethylene or making C−C bond cleavage to manufacture syngas. The existence of multiple cobalt species complicates matters even more. Therefore, it would be desirable to explore the connection of preparation methods as well as the nature of cobalt active sites for the dehydrogenation performance on zeolitic catalysts. In our present work, two cobalt based ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by different methods and employed in ethane conversion in the presence of CO2. Their Co species were characterized by UV-vis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy as well as temperature-programmed reduction. The effects of the Co species on the reaction pathways were discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation ZSM-5 zeolite was prepared according to the procedures reported before [7]. NaAlO2 (CP, Sinopharm Chemical) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, AR, Shanghai Lingfeng) were dissolved in an aqueous TPAOH solution with vigorously stirring for 4 h at room temperature. The obtained gel was then crystallized in a Teflon-lined autoclave at 170 °C for 72 h. The molar composition of the gel was 120SiO2: 4Al2O3: 48TPAOH: 3600H2O. The product was filtered, washed with deionized water, dried at 110 °C overnight and then calcined in air at 550 °C for 6 h to remove the template. The obtained zeolites were turned into NH4 + form by three consecutive ion exchanges with 1 M NH4NO3 aqueous solution at 80 °C for a total of 12 h (labeled as NH4-ZSM-5), and then calcined at 450 °C for 4 h to obtain HZSM-5. The Si/Al of the synthesized zeolite is 14, determined by ICP. Co-containing ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by two methods as described below. CoZ-IE samples were obtained with wet ion exchange method. Typically, 2.0 g NH4-ZSM-5 zeolites were exchanged with 60 mL 0.1 M Co(NO3)2 solution by three times at 80 °C for a total of 24 h. The obtained catalysts were filtered, washed, dried and finally calcined in air at 650 °C for 6 h. CoZ-IM sample was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method. Specifically, 1.0 g NH4-ZSM-5 support was impregnated with 4 mL aqueous Co(NO3)2 solution containing 0.087 g Co(NO3)2⋅6H2O. The loading of cobaltous nitrate is close to wet ion exchange capacity (ca. 1.72 wt % based on Co atoms). The obtained sample was dried at 100 °C overnight, and then calcined in air at 650 °C for 6 h. 2.2 Catalyst characterizations The crystal structure was determined by an X-ray diffractometer (Brucker, Madison, WI, USA), operated at 40 kV and 40 mA, using Cu K radiation with a scanning speed of 5 o/min. The surface areas and pore volumes were measured by N2 adsorption at –196 °C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument. The samples were outgassed at 150 °C for 10 h prior to test to ensure complete removal of the adsorbed impurities. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and 2-D atomic mappings were taken on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20, S-TWIN microscope operating. The bulk Si/Al ratios and cobalt contents were quantified by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) on a Thermo iCAP 6300 ICP-OES with a CID detector. H2-TPR profiles of the catalysts were obtained on a Micromeritics AutoChem II apparatus. About 100 mg samples were first held in Helium flow at 300 °C for 2 h, and then tested in a 30 mL/min flow of 10% H2/Ar, raising the temperature from 50 °C to 900 °C with a ramp rate of 10 °C/min. XPS data were acquired using a Perkin–Elmer PHI 5000C spectrometer with Mg Kα radiation as the excitation source. All binding energy values were referenced to the C1s peak at 284.8 eV. DRS UV-vis spectra were recorded from 300 to 800 nm on a Lambda 650S spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) attached with a polytetrafluoroethylene integrating sphere. The samples were dehydrated at 373 K for 5 h prior to the measurement. DRIFT spectroscopy were conducted on an FTIR (Nicolet 6700) equipped with an MCT detector cooled by liquid N2. Spectra were collected at 300 °C under 50 mL/min Helium flowing after activated at 450 °C for 4 h. The parameters included a resolution of 4 cm−1 and an accumulation of 32 scans. Pyridine-adsorbed FT-IR (Py-IR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer furnished with an in-situ cell. The sample was pretreated at 573 K for 4 h under a vacuum of 10−3 Pa before saturating with pyridine vapor and then evacuated at 100 °C. 2.3 Activity evaluation Catalytic tests for ethane conversion carried out in a fixed-bed flow microreactor under atmospheric pressure at 650 °C. 200 mg catalyst (40–60 mesh) was loaded and pretreated in the flow of N2 at 650 °C for 1 h prior to the reaction. The gaseous reactant contained 3% ethane and 6% CO2 in nitrogen at a total flow rate of 30 mL/min unless mentioned otherwise. The products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (GC), containing a flame ionization detector (FID) equipped with a 6 m Porapak Q packed column as well as a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) equipped with a carbon molecular sieve TDX-01 column. The conversion and selectivity were calculated using the standard normalization method. The reaction data in this work were reproducible, with a variation of less than 5%. The reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction was run in the same microreactor at atmospheric pressure with the catalyst loading of 200 mg. The total flow rate of the gas reactant is 30 mL/min with the molar ratio of H2/CO2/N2 is 1/1/1. The reaction temperature is in the range of 500–650 °C. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural characterization Fig. 1 depicts the XRD patterns of cobalt-containing ZSM-5 catalysts along with the ZSM-5 support. All demonstrate the typical MFI structures with characteristic reflections at 2θ = 8.0°, 8.9°, 23.1°, 23.4° and 24.0° [27]. The peak intensities are almost the same, showing their similar crystallinity. No diffraction patterns corresponding to cobalt oxide were observed on cobalt-containing catalysts, indicating that the cobalt species were highly dispersed on the support or existing in the form of tiny cobalt oxide particles beyond X-ray diffraction detection limitation. TEM images and 2-D mapping of the two catalysts prepared by impregnation and ion-exchange method are shown in Fig. 2 . They are both well crystallized and display a bulk-like morphology with submicron crystallite size about 400 nm. The cobalt species are well-dispersed on CoZ-IM catalysts with a diameter of less than 2 nm (Fig. 2b), while they are not discernible on the CoZ-IE catalysts (Fig. 2e). 2-D mappings depict that the cobalt atoms are evenly distributed in two catalysts regardless of how the cobalt species are introduced into ZSM support. The textural properties of two cobalt-containing ZSM-5 catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption. The detailed results are illustrated in Fig. S1 and summarized in Table 1 . Two cobalt-containing catalysts, regardless of preparation methods, exhibit similar surface areas and micropore volumes as compared with pristine ZSM-5, showing that these catalysts have similar crystallinities and the micropore channels of cobalt-containing catalysts are not blocked by the introduced cobalt species. Furthermore, the Co/Al ratios of samples are also close to each other, as confirmed by ICP data, owing to the fact that the similar amount of cobalt species have been introduced into the above two catalysts during the preparation. 3.2 Catalytic activity The catalytic performance of two cobalt-containing catalysts towards the ethane conversion in the presence of CO2 was evaluated, and the results are listed in Table 2 . The conversion and selectivity with time on stream are illustrated in Fig. 3 . Quite different catalytic behaviors are observed over the two catalysts. The major product formed over the CoZ-IE is ethylene (>94%). Corresponding to its high carbon balance (>96%), the above result indicates that ethane dehydrogenation has been proceeded on the cobalt-exchanged catalyst. Unlike CoZ-IE, CoZ-IM catalyst prepared by wet impregnation show a much higher conversion of ethane but extremely lower ethylene selectivity (<4%). The product is found to contain a large amount of CO and H2. Coupled with a high CO2 conversion, it can be concluded that dry reforming rather than dehydrogenation occurs on CoZ-IM. Meanwhile, CoZ-IM catalyst exhibits a low initial carbon balance ca. 76%, implying the serious coke deposition on the surface of the catalyst initially. CO2 conversion over CoZ-IE is very low (<5%), indicating that direct dehydrogenation is the main pathway with hardly any oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) or reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) co-existing on the cobalt-exchanged catalyst. This can be proved by the fact that its molar ratio of C2H4 to H2 in the product keeps stable during the reaction (∼x223C1.06) and very close to 1 (the expected value of direct ethane dehydrogenation only), as indicated in Fig. 3D. On the contrary, the molar ratio of C2H4 to H2 over CoZ-IM catalyst is much lower (< 0.02), indicating that reforming instead of dehydrogenation becomes the dominant pathway. The molar ratio of H2 to CO in the product is around 0.95, higher than the theoretical value of 0.75 in the dry reforming of ethane (C2H6 + 2CO2 → 4CO + 3H2), indicating that the part of produced H2 may come from deep cracking of ethane. This is consistent with its low carbon balance. It is worth noting that the CoZ-IE catalyst is quite stable, whose initial activity decreased only less than 6% after 6 h reaction with a small rise in ethylene selectivity. On the contrary, CoZ-IM catalyst showed a higher deactivation rate. 15% of initial C2H6 conversion and 17% of initial CO2 conversion were dropped during the same period. Meanwhile, the C2H4 selectivity increases gradually, indicating the proportion of dehydrogenation increases with time on stream, though it is still not the dominant pathway over CoZ-IM catalyst as indicated by its extremely low molar ratio of C2H4 to H2 in the product (Fig. 3D). 3.3 State of Co species UV-vis diffuse reflectance was carried out to characterize the nature of cobalt species. As illustrated in Fig. 4 , two catalysts show quite different UV-vis spectra, implying their different cobalt states. Adsorption bands located at around 520, 590 and 660 nm assigned to v3 (4A2-4T1(P)) charge transfer transition of Co(II) species in tetrahedral coordination appear on the spectra of CoZ-IE catalyst [28]. On the contrary, two broad bands at ca. 410 and 720 nm are observed over CoZ-IM catalyst, which can be ascribed to the electron transition adsorption (1T1g(F)→1T1(P)) of CoO x species dispersed on T-defect sites for ZSM-5 framework and ligand-metal charge-transfer (1A1g→1T1g) in spinel Co3O4, respectively [29,30], implying that the predominant cobalt species in CoZ-IM were Co3O4 and CoO x species instead of the Co(II) species. The different cobalt species over two catalysts may be caused by the different preparation method. Similar results were obtained by XANES spectra in Co-based SAPO-34 catalysts prepared ion-exchange and impregnation method [31]. The mechanism of interaction between cobalt species and ZSM-5 support was discussed by comparing the infrared spectra of the catalysts in the hydroxyl stretching region (3800–3200 cm−1), as shown in Fig. 5 . Isolated silanol groups (∼x223C 3740 cm−1), vicinal silanol groups (∼x223C 3720 cm−1), bridging hydroxyl groups (∼x223C 3610 cm−1) and nest silanol groups (∼x223C 3500 cm−1) can be identified for all the samples [32,33]. However, the intensities for these characteristic hydroxyl groups are quite different among the samples. For CoZ-IE catalyst, bands at 3740, 3720 and 3500 cm−1 keep intact on while the band at 3610 cm−1 decreased obviously as compared to those of HZSM-5 support, revealing the cobalt species mainly replace the protons in hydroxyl group (Si-OH-Al) during the ion exchange preparation [34]. In contrast, the hydroxyls at 3500 and 3720 cm−1 decrease significantly on CoZ-IM catalyst while those at 3740 and 3610 cm−1 shrank slightly, suggesting the cobalt species were mainly interacted with the surface silanol nests or some adjacent silanol groups by the impregnation method [35]. The different mechanism of interaction may account for the different cobalt species existing in the two catalysts, resulting in completely different catalytic behaviors in ethane conversion as shown above. The catalysts were also investigated by XPS to examine the chemical states of cobalt species on surface, and the deconvoluted spectra in the Co (2p) region are shown in Fig. S2. Two peaks at 782 eV and 796 eV assigned to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 bands appear on the profiles of samples [36]. Satellite peaks at higher binding energies are also observed (∼x223C787 eV and ∼x223C803 eV). For two fresh catalysts, no peak at 778.1 eV corresponding to the metallic Co0 state was detected (Table 3 ). The relative amounts of surface Co(II) and Co(III) species for fresh CoZ-IM were 54.8% and 45.2%, respectively. The existence of Co(II) species can be ascribed to their interaction with hydroxyl groups on the surface of zeolite, such as Si-OH-Al and silanol nests, etc. Similar phenomenon has been observed in previous work [37]. It is noteworthy that only Co(II) species appeared on fresh CoZ-IE, which is consistent with the UV–vis results. 3.4 H2-TPR H2-TPR was carried out to investigate the redox ability of cobalt species of the catalysts, the results are presented in Fig. 6 . Broad profiles containing two reduction peaks were observed under temperature interval around 250–500 °C (Region I) for CoZ-IM catalyst, which can be ascribed to the reduction of Co3O4 and CoO x species to Co(II) [38]. In contrast, CoZ-IE exhibited a very weak reduction peak in Region I, indicating little Co(III) species on the surface of catalyst, which is consistent with UV-vis and XPS results. Meanwhile, both catalysts exhibit an intensity reduction peak in the high temperature above 600 °C (Region II), corresponding to the reduction of cobaltous species to metallic Co [39]. However, their reduction temperatures are not the same. The peak temperature of CoZ-IE catalyst is 830 °C, higher than that of CoZ-IM (770 °C), implying that the Co2+ species introduced by ion exchange are more difficult to be reduced owing to their stronger interaction with zeolitic framework. 3.5 Acidity The acidity of the cobalt-containing catalysts were investigated by Py-IR analysis, and the recorded infrared spectra are illustrated in Fig S3. Characteristic band at ca. 1450 cm−1 assigned to pyridine coordinately bonded to Lewis acid sites, as well as that at 1540 cm−1 ascribed to protonation of pyridine by Bronsted acid sites, are observed on both catalysts [40]. Quantitative determination of acid sites was derived from the integrated area of each characteristic band. As shown in Table 4 , the Bronsted acid sites of CoZ-IE are significantly less than that of CoZ-IM, due to the more complete substitution of proton in Si-OH-Al by cobaltous ions exchange. Meanwhile, the amount of Lewis acid sites in the CoZ-IE is slightly higher than that in the CoZ15-IM catalyst. This may be due to the better dispersion of Co2+ with electron-withdrawing properties in CoZ-IE [26]. 4 Discussion Two distinct reaction pathways for ethane conversion in the presence of CO2 are found over CoZ-IE and CoZ-IM catalysts, which may be associated with the different nature of the cobalt species in two catalysts as revealed by the above characterizations. For CoZ-IE catalyst, the cobalt species are tetrahedrally coordinated Co(II) ones located at the ion sites of the zeolites. These Co(II) species are very stable and cannot be reduced or oxidized under the reaction condition, which have been proved by H2-TPR and XPS results. Tetrahedrally coordinated Co(II) species are electron-deficient and can act as Lewis acid sites along with the neighboring O atoms as Lewis base, resulting in activation of ethane via dissociative adsorption [41,42]. Thus, ethylene is the main product over CoZ-IE catalyst. Similar results were obtained over Ni-based HY catalysts during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, showing that C2H6 adsorbed and activated on isolated cationic Ni2+ Lewis acid sites rather than NiO clusters by breaking C−H bonding of the methyl group, followed by the β-hydrogen elimination to form C2H4 [43]. The non-redox ability of these Co(II) species also account for the low conversion of CO2 which may come from Boudouard reaction. The above conclusion can further be proved by the results of ethane conversion in the absence of CO2 listed in Table 2. The dehydrogenation activity increased slightly without the addition of CO2, resulting from the disappearance of competitive adsorption of CO2 with ethane [44]. Meanwhile, the catalytic stability decreased due to the more serious coke deposition as indicated by TGA data listed in Table 4 (2.3% vs 1.9%), confirming the coke elimination by Boudouard reaction after the addition of CO2. While for CoZ-IM catalyst, a completely different pattern has been observed on cobalt species, which appeared in form of cobalt oxides on the surface of zeolites. In addition, nearly half of the cobalt species are Co(III) ones which can be reduced during the reaction. This can be confirmed by H2-TPR and XPS measurements. As indicated in Table 3, the percentage of Co(III) species decreases from 45.2 to 18.6% after 6 h reaction, indicating the loss of lattice oxygen atom which usually plays a dominant role in redox reaction system [45]. Meanwhile, the metallic Co0 was not detected, owing to the fact that the surface Co(II) species are difficult to reduce to metallic state under the reaction condition, resulting from the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), which agrees with H2-TPR results. The percentage of Co(III) species of spent catalyst increases after regeneration with CO2 at 650 °C for 2 h, implying that a part of cobaltous species on the surface have been re-oxidized to Co(III) ones, revealing the lattice oxygen can be supplemented by CO2 oxidant. This can further be proved by UV-vis results shown in Fig. 4. Unlike CoZ-IE catalyst which has no significant difference after reaction for 6 h, a triplet band corresponding to divalent cobalt accompanying the weak absorption bands for cobaltic oxide were observed on CoZ-IM catalyst after reaction. After the regeneration with CO2, the spectral peaks corresponding to cobalt oxides are more obvious while maintaining the triplet bands ascribed to divalent cobalt species. This redox ability along with the Lewis acidity may account for much higher CO2 conversion over CoZ-IM catalyst stemmed from the dry reforming reaction. As indicated by previous calculation about ethane reforming by CO2 [46], syngas is obtained through C–C bond cleavage of *C2HyO intermediates which are produced via the C–H bond scission of ethane followed by reactive oxygen *O insertion reaction. As indicated in CoZ-IE, Co(II) species can break the C–H bond of ethane. Meanwhile, the Co(III) species can be reduced to supply *O species, facilitating the formation of *C2HyO intermediates for syngas production. The oxidation is quite similar with zeolite-supported NiO catalyst which can selectively oxidize CH4 to CO through the reduction of NiO to Ni0 [45]. This is the reason why no syngas is obtained over CoZ-IE catalyst since no *O species can be produced on its stable Co(II) species. The above explanation can also be proved by the fact that the ethylene selectivity over CoZ-IM catalyst increases gradually with the reaction time due to the decrease of the percentage of Co(III) species, confirming the crucial role of these redox Co(III) species in syngas production via reforming. To obtain a deep understanding of the role of CO2, the effect of CO2 partial pressure on ethane conversion over Co-IM was investigated. The content of ethane in reactant remains unchanged at 3%. The results are shown in Table 2 and Fig.S4. It can be seen clearly that CoZ-IM is an excellent ethane dehydrogenation catalyst in the absence of CO2 whose selectivity to ethylene maintains over 90% during the reaction, just as reported before [47]. So that should make sense, because no *O species can be produced without CO2, which would result in a hindered formation of *C2HyO intermediates for syngas production. However, the situation is quite different after the addition of CO2. The selectivity to ethylene decreases with the increase of CO2 partial pressure. When the CO2/C2H6 ratio increase to 1, the ethylene formation is greatly suppressed and syngas becomes the main products, indicating dry reforming becomes the dominant pathway instead of dehydrogenation since sufficient *O species can be produced by Co(III) catalyzed reduction of the introduced CO2. The different roles of the Co species indicated above in ethane conversion in the presence of CO2 can further be proved by the different catalytic performance of RWGS reaction over two Co catalysts, whose results are illustrated in Fig. S5. It can be seen clearly that the activity of Co-IE catalyst is extremely low, confirming that its non-redox Co(II) species are unable to activate CO2, even under the high H2 pressure, leading to non-oxidative dehydrogenation only. In contrary, Co-IM is active for RWGS reaction, showing that CO2 can be reduced to CO over this catalyst. Thus, the reactive oxygen *O species can be produced over this catalysts, which can facilitate the syngas production according to the previous calculation [46]. Deactivation was found over both catalysts. However, the dropping rate was quite different. For CoZ-IE, only less than 6% of its initial conversion of ethane was lost after 6 h reaction, which is much lower as compared to CoZ-IM (the corresponding data was ca. 15%). TG analysis shows that the coke amount deposited on the spent catalysts after 6 h reaction has the sequence of CoZ-IM (8.7 wt%) > CoZ-IE (1.9 wt%), exactly the same as that of deactivation. The higher amount of coke on the catalyst may be due to the larger number of Bronsted acid sites, since the pyrolysis of C–C bond and olefin oligomerization can be accelerated by Bronsted acid sites [48]. Ultimately, a large number of breakage for C–C bond of ethane molecule in the dry reforming over CoZ-IM catalyst inevitably leads to more carbon deposition. 5 Conclusion In the present paper, two cobalt-containing ZSM-5 catalysts have been prepared using wet ion exchange and impregnation method and evaluated in the ethane conversion in the presence of CO2. They are all active for ethane conversion despite of different reaction pathway. The cobalt-exchanged ZSM-5 catalyst shows good dehydrogenation activity, stemming from the isolated Co2+ stabilized by the strong interaction with the zeolitic support. These Co(II) species are quite stable during the reactions and can act as Lewis acid sites for ethane activation via dissociative adsorption. In contrast, a mixture of Co(II) and Co(III) oxide species are observed on the cobalt-impregnated catalyst, proceeding an oxidation-reduction cycle beside its Lewis acidity, leading to dry reforming of ethane to produce syngas. These results provide a basis for selective regulation of reaction products in CO2-C2H6 system. A promising controlling pathway for ethane conversion can be designed based on the above findings.

        "dc:description": "Two cobalt-based ZSM-5 catalysts CoZ-IE and CoZ-IM were prepared by ion-exchange and incipient wetness impregnation method, respectively, and characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption, TEM, XPS, UV–vis, H2-TPR and Py-IR. The catalytic performance towards ethane conversion over the two catalysts in the presence of CO2 was compared. Despite of their similar textual properties and Co contents, the product distributions over the two catalysts were quite different. Ethylene with high selectivity of 95% formed over CoZ-IE while syngas was produced as the main product on CoZ-IM, indicating dry reforming becomes the dominant reaction pathway instead of dehydrogenation. The difference pathway can be ascribed to the different nature of Co species in two catalysts. The isolated Co2+ anchored at zeolitic framework in CoZ-IE is quite stable and can only act as Lewis acid sites for ethane dehydrogenation. In contrast, the cobalt oxides on the zeolitic surface in CoZ-IM can proceed oxidation-reduction cycles in the CO2-C2H6 system, facilitating the activation of CO2 and the scission of C−C bonds, leading to the dry reforming of ethane.",
