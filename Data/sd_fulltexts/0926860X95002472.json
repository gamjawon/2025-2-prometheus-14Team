The influence of catalyst load and reaction temperature upon rate development of the ozonation process has also been examined. The observed dependence of system reactivity on pH and the results obtained by ozonation experiments with MnO2 catalysts of different pHzm values agree with a reaction mechanism involving the formation of a surface Mn - oxalic acid complex. Keywords: Heterogeneous catalysis; Ozonation; Oxalic acid; Manganese dioxide 1. Introduction Ozonation is an attractive tool for the abatement of different classes of organic pollutants in aqueous solution [1], because many organic compounds can be easily degraded to lower molecular weight substances through reaction with ozone [2]. Unfortunately, some oxidation products are refractory to further oxidative conversion by means of ozone, thus preventing a complete abatement of TOC. This is the case for species like oxalic, glyoxalic and acetic acids which, at least at neutral or acidic pH, cannot be completely mineralized by the * Corresponding author. Tel.

Andreozzi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 75-81 action of ozone alone [3]. Similar restrictions are generally found with also other abatement techniques such as wet oxidation [4]. This fact has stimulated the research for catalysts which enhance the ozone capability to oxidize these species up to a complete mineralization. Our previous investigations [5] have shown that the catalytic action of Mn\" ions can be profitably exploited for promoting the oxalic acid oxidation by ozone. Results also strongly suggested the key role exerted in the catalytic mechanism by higher oxidation states of manganese, likely Mnw, which sustain the formation of MnIll ions. Thus, oxidizing and reducing properties respectively of ozone and of organic substrates make exploitable Mn catalysis in homoge- neous reacting systems whatever the initial Mn oxidation state is. In this investigation the role exerted by MnO2 as a heterogeneous catalyst for the ozonation of oxalic acid in aqueous solution is explored with special attention given to the influence of pH upon reaction kinetics. The study aims at providing chemical information on the reaction mechanisms which regulate the develop- ment of catalytic ozonation. This information is expected to give a sound basis for the mathematical modeling of the reaction process. At the best of the authors' knowledge no information is available from the literature on MnO2 capability to act as a heterogenous catalyst for the ozonation of organic pollutants. Previous studies on homogeneous manganese catalysis suggested the opportunity of extending the experimental investigation to the new research argument of heterogeneous catalysis. 2. Experimental All the ozonation experiments were performed in a semibatch apparatus reported in detail elsewhere [6]. For each run 245 mg of dihydrate oxalic acid (99.8%) were dissolved and a proper amount (0-200 mg) of solid MnO2 was added in 800 ml of an aqueous buffered solution. KH2PO4, Na2HPO4 and H3PO4 aqueous solutions were used as buffer mixtures to keep the pH constant during the whole ozonation experiments. The solution was submitted to ozona- tion by bubbling a 36 1/h ozonized oxygen stream whose ozone content was 3 vol.-%. Samples withdrawn from the reactor at different ozonation times were analyzed by means of a Hewlett-Packard 1090L HPLC equipped with a spherisorb $5C6 reverse-phase column flowed with 1.0 ml/min aqueous buffered acidic solution. Manganese dioxide (99.99% purity), purchased from Aldrich, was separated by sieving it into two granulometric fractions and was directly used without any treatment. The catalyst pH of zero point of charge (prize) was determined according to literature [7]. BET N2 adsorption was performed on several samples characterized by a different diameter d in the range 90-300 /xm, for which, a surface area of 6.9 ___ 0.2 m2/g was obtained. R.

For each ozonation experiment, the catalytic effect exerted at the investigated pH by dissolved manganese ions was separately evaluated by submitting to ozonation oxalic acid added to aqueous solutions previously kept into contact with solid MnO2 and then filtered. 3. Results and discussion The MnO2 efficiency as a heterogeneous catalyst for oxalic acid ozonation in aqueous solution is clearly evidenced by the experimental data shown in Fig. 1. At pH = 4.1 and T= 25, a slight reactivity is shown by oxalic acid in the presence of 200 mg of suspended MnO2 and in the absence of ozone. The reactivity is strongly enhanced by the addition of ozone, in spite of the reduced amount of MnO2 (75 mg). An intermediate reactivity is observed in the case of homogeneous catalysis, which is ascribed to Mn ions delivered from MnO2 into solution [5]. Slight competition of oxalic acid oxidation through MnO2 reduction and homogeneous catalysis is similarly observed at the other investigated pH's. The results of ozonation experiments involving heterogeneous catalysis by MnO2, performed in the range 3.2 < pH < 7.0, are shown in Fig. 2. A remarkable increase of the initial ozonation rate of oxalic acid is observed when decreasing pH, the major enhancement of the system reactivity occurring in the range 4.1 < pH < 6.0. The dependence of the system reactivity upon catalyst load is examined by means of ozonation experiments at pH = 4.1 (Fig. 3), whereas the effect of temperature upon catalytic ozonation of oxalic acid is illustrated in Fig. 4. 78 R.

In both cases, a first simplified analysis based on the evaluation of initial rates suggests a non regular behavior, which can be tentatively ascribed to non linear kinetics and/or to mass transfer limitations occurring at the largest catalyst load and at the highest temperature. A more detailed analysis, based on a quantitative mathematical model, is required to clarify this point. -~-2 E o ~b 2;~ 3'o 4b TIME(rain) Fig. 3.

Taken as a whole, the results of the present investigation allow to recognize the marked role exerted by MnO2 as a heterogeneous catalyst in the ozonation of oxalic acid and to assess the influence of pH upon reaction kinetics. A reaction mechanism can be tentatively proposed on the basis of these results and of literature information on the reductive dissolution of MnO2 by oxalic acid [8,9]. According to these studies, manganese dioxide behaves as an n-type semiconductor so that Mnm surface metal centers undergo reactions similar to those reported for the homogeneous Mnm-oxalic acid reacting systems [9]. Thus, the oxidation of oxalic acid can be ascribed to the formation of a surface complex followed by a 'one electron' exchange step and by the detachment of the reduced surface metal center. /\\Mnlllon~\" +C2O2- ~ ~MnIllc204 + H20 (1) _II / /\\Mnlnc20~- ~ /Mn -1- CO2 + CO2 (2) ~Mnn ~ Mnnaq. (3) In order to explain the effect of ozone, several reaction routes can be put forward. Although no evidence of ozone adsorption on the solid surface is derived from the experimental results or from literature, the presence of nucleophilic active centers suggests a possible interaction with the electrophilic ozone molecule: /~MO-+ 03 \"---9./ \\MO- ... +O-O-O- (4) which could result into the formation of a chemically bonded superficial species.

In effect, two different active sites, MOH~- and MO-, are present on the solid surface. The equilibrium: MO- + 2H+ ~ MOH~- (8) is characterized by the so-called 'pH of zero point of charge', that is by the pH value at which a(MO-) = a(MOH~-). For the catalyst here considered, the value pH zp~ -- 5.6 has been experimentally evaluated. Thus, the observed decrease of the system reactivity, especially marked in the range 4.1 < pH < 6.0 (Fig. 2) is consistent with the decrease of the concentration of the surface sites MnOH~- which can support the adsorption of oxalic acid. It must also be remarked that in the same pH range changes of system reactivity could be caused by the changes occurring in the dissociation degree of oxalic acid whose second dissociation constant is 10-4.27 M [10].

Andreozzi et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 75-81 81 explanation of the MnO2 surface activity is also given by ozonation experiments performed with a different MnO2 catalyst, which presents a pHzpvalue of 4.74. In this case a rather complete quenching of system reactivity is observed at pH = 6.0 in contrast with the results obtained when using the previous MnO2 catalyst (Fig. 5). 4. Conclusions On the basis of the previous discussion, the following conclusions can be drawn: Solid manganese dioxide catalyzes the ozonation of oxalic acid at moderately acidic pH; The reaction mechanism is likely to involve the adsorption of the substrate on the solid; Different mechanisms can be put forward for the oxidative action of ozone which should be tested in subsequent work; The formation of a surface manganese-oxalic acid complex and its depen- dence on the pH are consistent with the effect of this parameter on the system reactivity; The present chemical information could be exploited to develop a mathemati- cal model of the reacting system. The assessment of the 'best' reaction mechanism, the quantitative evaluation of the rate constants and the descrip- tion of the mass-transfer limitations eventually present are the main results expected from this model.
