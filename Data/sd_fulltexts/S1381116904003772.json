The catalyst produced appreciable propene yields by combining the alkane activation properties of Ga2O3 and the partial oxidation behaviour MoO3 in a synergistic manner. Catalysts based on a physical mixture of Ga2O3 and MoO3 have been prepared and evaluated for propane partial oxidation to propene. The Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts produced appreciable propene yields and it has been demonstrated that the catalyst synergistically combined the alkane activation properties of Ga2O3 with the selective oxidation function of MoO3. Studies have probed the influence of varying the Ga/Mo ratio. Catalysts with a 1/1 and 1/3 ratio showed similar catalytic activity, whilst reducing the ratio to 1/10 significantly reduced the propene yield. Comparison of the 1/1 Ga2O3/MoO3 catalyst with a 6wt.% V2O5/TiO2 catalyst, which is known to be active for selective propane oxidation, showed that the propene yields were greater for Ga2O3/MoO3. Keywords Propane Propene Partial oxidation Oxidative dehydrogenation Gallium oxide Molybdenum oxide 1 Introduction The catalytic partial oxidation of propene is commercially important and oxidation to higher value oxygenates has been a major research aim for many years. Given the increasing industrial demand for propene, for the production of acrolein, acrylic acid acrylonitrile and iso-propanol, it has been desirable to develop catalysts capable of producing propene by dehydrogenation of the more abundant alkane. Studies have probed the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes as a potential route for alkene production. Unlike non-oxidative dehydrogenation, oxidative propene dehydrogenation is exothermic and avoids the thermodynamic constraints that limit propene yield from non-oxidative dehydrogenation. However, the introduction of an oxidant may also lead to lower than maximum predicted propene yields as deep oxidation to carbon oxides are more thermodynamically favoured. A number of catalysts have been reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, including supported chromium oxide [1], molybdenum containing catalysts [2–4] and more recently, complex multi-component metal oxide catalysts containing both molybdenum and vanadium. These multi-component catalysts, such as V–Mo–Te–Nb mixed oxides [5], are complex, and the formation of the active phase is critical to maximise performance. The most extensively studied catalysts are those based on supported vanadium oxide. The acidic/basic properties of the supported catalysts are found to be a strong determining factor in the catalytic performance, additionally the vanadia loading and its interaction with the support are also important. In general, reports detailing the use of vanadia on amphoteric supports are most common, although basic supports have also been used. It is accepted that the basic supports give more selective catalysts due to the easier desorption of propene from the surface. To date, a number of catalysts supports have been tested and characterised, these include Al2O3 [6–8], TiO2, SiO2 and MgO [7,8]. In particular, vanadia supported on MgO has demonstrated promising activity and selectivity to propene although there still seems to be general disagreements in the literature about the active site and V–Mg–O phase responsible for the higher selectivity [9–11]. V2O5/TiO2 catalysts have also proved to be successful, demonstrating relatively high activity and a low temperature of activation, which has led to further studies focusing on the addition of various promoters [12,13]. Although it is often the case that promoted catalysts showed an increase of propane conversion they also showed a simultaneous decrease of propene selectivity. In previous studies, catalysts based on a mixture of Ga2O3 and MoO3 have been developed for the partial oxidation of methane [14]. The Ga2O3/MoO3 catalyst showed an increased yield of partial oxidation products by combining the alkane activation properties of Ga2O3 and the partial oxidation behaviour of MoO3 in a synergistic manner. It is apparent that similar catalytic properties are also required for the partial oxidation of propane to propene. It is against this background that the current study has been undertaken to probe the efficacy of Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts for the partial oxidation of propane. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Catalysts comprising physical mixtures of Ga2O3 (Aldrich 99.9+%) and MoO3 (Aldrich 99.9+%) were prepared by grinding the oxides (1:1 molar ratio) in a pestle and mortar. The physical mixture was divided, half was calcined at 650°C for 3h in static air, whilst the other half was used uncalcined. The catalysts were denoted Ga2O3/MoO3 calcined and Ga2O3/MoO3 uncalcined. The single oxides tested were used as supplied without further treatment. A series of vanadium catalysts with various V2O5 loadings were prepared by impregnation of a TiO2 support (Degussa P25, 50m2 g−1) with an aqueous solution of ammonium metavanadate. The resulting paste was dried for 16h at 120°C and calcined in static air at 450°C for 5h. The V2O5 loading was varied from 3 to 10wt.%. All catalysts were pelleted to a uniform particle size range of 250–600μm. 2.2 Catalyst characterisation Catalysts were characterised by powder X-ray diffraction using an Enraf Nonius PSD120 diffractometer with a monochromatic Cu Kα1 source operated at 40keV and 30mA. Phases were identified by matching experimental patterns to the JCPDS powder diffraction file. Surface areas were determined by multi-point N2 adsorption at 77K, and data were treated in accordance with the BET method. Raman spectra were recorded using a Renishaw system 1000 dispersive laser Raman microscope. An argon ion laser (514.5nm) was used for excitation, and was typically operated at 20mW. Samples were investigated in powdered form, they were placed on a microscope slide and the laser focused onto the sample to produce a spot size of ca. 3μm in diameter. Spectra were collected using a back scattering geometry with a 180° angle between the illuminating and the collected light. 2.3 Catalyst activity Catalytic performance was measured at atmospheric pressure in a fixed bed micro-reactor using a quartz reactor tube (i.d. 9mm). Catalyst activity was determined over the temperature range ca. 200–550°C with constant propane/oxygen/helium ratio of 2/1/8.5. A constant catalyst volume of 0.25ml was used with a total flow rate of 40mlmin−1 giving a gas hourly space velocity of 9600h−1. The products were analysed online with a Varian 3800 chromatograph, using Porapak Q and Molsieve columns, equipped with thermal conductivity and flame ionisation detectors. Propane conversion was calculated on the basis of products detected and in all experiments the carbon balances were 100 ± 2%. 3 Results and discussion Propane conversion over the Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts and comparison with Ga2O3 and MoO3 are shown in Fig. 1 . The data were obtained at steady state conversion and there was no measurable deactivation for any of the catalysts. The Ga2O3 catalyst showed initial propane conversion at 375°C increasing to ca. 8% at 500°C. On the contrary, the rate of propane oxidation over MoO3 was considerably lower. Initial activity was detected at 425°C and only increased to ca. 3% at 500°C. Both of the Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts showed considerably higher rates of propane oxidation. The profile of propane conversion with temperature was broadly similar for the calcined and uncalcined catalysts. However, above 425°C the propane conversion over the uncalcined catalyst was marginally greater than the calcined material. No appreciable activity was observed below 550°C in an empty quartz reactor. Propene, CO2 and CO were the only reaction products over the calcined Ga2O3/MoO3, Ga2O3 and MoO3 catalysts. The same products were observed with the uncalcined Ga2O3/MoO3 catalyst, but it also showed <2% selectivity to acrolein above 440°C. Propene was a major partial oxidation product and the selectivity as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 2 . Propene selectivity was lowest for the Ga2O3 catalyst, gradually decreasing from ca. 35% at 375°C to ca. 20% at 520°C. MoO3 was most selective for the partial oxidation of propane to propene. Selectivities in excess of 95% were observed even at 540°C, but it must be noted that these high selectivities were obtained at low propane conversion. The propene selectivity over the calcined and uncalcined Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts demonstrated the same trends with temperature. The calcined catalyst showed initially 100% selectivity to propene, this decreased gradually to 61% at 470°C. The propene selectivity was lower over the uncalcined catalyst across the entire temperature range, but still remained greater than the Ga2O3 catalyst. Studies have been performed replacing either the Ga2O3 or MoO3 components of the catalysts with SiC. The aim of these studies was to probe the effect of possible dilution for the two component catalysts. Representative data for comparison are presented in Table 1 . The replacement of the Ga2O3 component with SiC suppressed the propane conversion relative to MoO3 alone. The propane conversion was also significantly lower than with the Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts. The selectivity to propene was also very similar to MoO3. Replacement of MoO3 with SiC showed that propane conversion was increased slightly when compared to Ga2O3 alone. This increase was minor, however, the propene selectivity was not affected by the addition of SiC. In conclusion, the effect of diluting the Ga2O3 and MoO3 catalysts did not significantly alter their activity and selectivity. The results from studies using SiC to dilute Ga2O3 and MoO3 showed that the enhanced performance of the Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts was not a simple consequence of diluting either component. The per pass yields of propene for the 1/1 Ga2O3/MoO3, Ga2O3 and MoO3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . The MoO3 catalyst gave the lowest propene yields. The propene yields over Ga2O3 were higher than MoO3 and this was due to the higher propane conversion. It must also be noted that considerably higher temperatures where required with the MoO3 catalyst. The propene yields over both Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts where markedly similar. Both exhibited a 5.7% per pass yield at 470°C for the calcined catalyst and, at 460°C for the uncalcined catalyst. For comparison with the catalytic data in this study a series of V2O5/TiO2 catalysts were also prepared and tested. The V2O5/TiO2 catalyst system is one of the most widely studied for this reaction and it is generally accepted to be one of the most efficient catalysts. The best performance of the V2O5/TiO2 catalysts was shown with a 6wt.% V2O5 loading. A comparison of propane partial oxidation, at approximately constant conversion, ca. 10% where possible, is presented in Table 2 . Although the reaction conditions differ, the performance of the 6wt.% V2O5/TiO2 catalyst was in agreement with the published data in the literature. The V2O5/TiO2 catalysts were active at lower temperatures than the Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts, and such a decrease in temperature could be expected to produce higher propene selectivity by reducing over oxidation. However, this was not the case and the propene yield from the 6wt.% V2O5/TiO2 catalyst was lower than that for the Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts. Despite the higher temperatures, the propene selectivities and yields for the Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts were superior. These data clearly demonstrate that the Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts showed promising activity for propane oxidative dehydrogenation. Furthermore, at this stage no attempt has been made to maximise the performance of the Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts and it is envisaged that further improvements in catalyst performance are possible. The influence of changing the Ga2O3 to MoO3 ratio has been investigated and the effect on propane conversion is shown in Fig. 4 . The catalyst with Ga/Mo = 1/1 was most active showing the greatest propane conversion across the temperature range. Decreasing the ratio to 1/3 resulted in a marginal decrease of propane conversion, but it remained close to the 1/1 catalyst. Decreasing the Ga2O3 content further to 1/10 resulted in a marked decrease of propane conversion when compared to the 1/1 catalyst. However, the rate of propane oxidation remained significantly greater than MoO3 alone and indicated that even the addition of a relatively low concentration of Ga2O3 improved propane conversion. Selectivity to propene for the Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts with varying Ga/Mo ratios are presented in Fig. 5 . The propene selectivity for Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts with ratios 1/1 and 1/3 were similar over the investigated temperature range. Propene selectivity decreased from 100% at 340°C to approximately 40% at 470°C and above. Decreasing the Ga/Mo ratio to 1/10 resulted in an increased selectivity to propene. This was evident across the whole temperature range, although it must be noted that propane conversion was generally lower over the 1/10 Ga2O3/MoO3 catalyst. Catalyst surface areas determined by the BET method are summarised in Table 2. The MoO3 surface area was low whilst Ga2O3 was considerably greater at 25m2 g−1. The surface areas for the calcined and uncalcined Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts were 13m2 g−1, the expected value for a 1:1 physical mixture. It was also apparent that the surface area was not decreased by calcination. The catalysts were characterised using powder X-ray diffraction and laser Raman spectroscopy. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns for MoO3 and the 1/1 Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 6 . The powder pattern from Ga2O3 showed that diffraction peaks were broad and relatively low in intensity demonstrating that the structure was relatively disordered. On the other hand, diffraction data from MoO3 showed that the phase was highly crystalline. The Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts showed largely diffraction peaks from MoO3. Careful inspection of the diffraction data revealed that diffraction from Ga2O3 was observed, but due to the low intensity of the peaks they were barely discernable. This is not surprising considering the differences of diffraction intensity between the diffraction patterns from MoO3 and Ga2O3. However, it is important to note that no new mixed Ga/Mo phases were produced, neither was there any recordable distortion of the MoO3 unit cell. Furthermore, after use there were no significant changes to the powder XRD patterns. An additional diffraction peak at ca. 22° was observed in the uncalcined 1/1 Ga2O3/MoO3 catalyst. The peak was attributed to the presence of GaO(OH) and it is interesting that this catalyst alone also demonstrated low selectivity to acrolein. It was evident that the MoO3 diffraction intensities from the Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts were altered when compared to the MoO3 starting material. These differences were not observed between the Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts and they are not due to modification of the MoO3 during calcination. Therefore, it is more likely that the grinding process effects the change in morphology during the catalyst preparation. The Raman spectra for representative catalysts are presented in Fig. 7 . It was not possible to obtain Raman data for Ga2O3 as no structure was observed in the spectra. The Raman data for MoO3 and the Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts confirms the conclusions obtained from the powder X-ray diffraction data. The Raman spectra for MoO3 was the same as both of the Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts, reiterating the conclusion that MoO3 is not significantly altered on production of the two component catalysts. The characterisation studies indicate that the Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts were comprised from a mixture of Ga2O3 and MoO3 and there was no evidence for the formation of any new mixed phases. It was also apparent that calcined and uncalcined catalysts were not significantly different. The Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts produced a propene yield comparable with known active propane oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts. It is therefore interesting to consider the origin of this activity. In earlier studies investigating CH4/D2 exchange it has been shown that the rate of reaction for Ga2O3 was at least two orders of magnitude greater than any other metal oxide [15]. The exchange reaction is used as a probe for CH bond activation and the data from the earlier study demonstrate that Ga2O3 is a very effective catalyst for alkane activation. It is also noteworthy that Ga2O3 is used in combination with H-ZSM5 for the Cyclar process to convert propane to aromatics. In the Cyclar process, Ga2O3 is implicated in alkane activation through a dehydrogenation step [16]. Comparison of the propane oxidation over Ga2O3 and MoO3 showed that the conversion over Ga2O3 was considerably higher than that for MoO3. This is consistent with the ability of Ga2O3 to activate alkanes. On the contrary MoO3 alone was very selective for propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene. The combination of the oxides into the Ga2O3/MoO3 catalyst combines the beneficial properties of increased oxidation rate of Ga2O3 with the selective oxidation function of MoO3 in a beneficial manner. The data from catalysts with varying Ga/Mo emphasize the importance of the synergy between Ga2O3 and MoO3. As the Ga/Mo ratio was decreased from 1/3 to 1/10 the behaviour of the dual component catalyst tended towards the behaviour exhibited by MoO3. These data reiterate that the Ga2O3 component is important for increasing the rate of propane conversion, whilst the MoO3 imparts selectivity to propene. Furthermore, the combination of the two oxides demonstrated a synergistic effect to produce a marked increase in propene yield. The Ga2O3/MoO3 catalyst has been used successfully for methane partial oxidation to methanol [17]. It is interesting that the addition of Ga2O3 to MoO3 resulted in an increased methanol yield by promoting methane conversion, whilst maintaining the higher methanol selectivity of MoO3. The same type of synergy was observed for selective propane oxidation in the present study and it is apparent that both reactions have similarities, as the alkanes must be activated before undergoing partial oxidation. The characterisation data indicates that the Ga2O3/MoO3 catalysts were comprised from a physical mixture of Ga2O3 and MoO3. This being the case the synergy developed between the two oxides is associated with the boundary where the oxides are in contact with each other. This type of contact synergy is known for Ga2O3 in other reactions [18], and it appears that the effect is also important for propane partial oxidation. 4 Conclusions Catalysts based on a physical mixture of Ga2O3 and MoO3 have been prepared and evaluated for propane dehydrogenation by partial oxidation. Characterisation studies indicated that the catalyst was comprised of a mixture of the component Ga2O3 and MoO3 oxides. The Ga2O3/MoO3 catalyst synergistically combined the alkane activation properties of Ga2O3 with the selective oxidation function of MoO3. The yield of propene of the non-optimised Ga2O3/MoO3 catalyst was comparable with a V2O5/TiO2 catalyst, which is known to show high activity. Reducing the Ga/Mo ratio from 1/1 resulted in a slight decrease of propene yield whilst reducing the ratio to 1/10 resulted in a significantly reduced yield.
