CAS Key Laboratory of Low-carbon Conversion Science & Engineering Shanghai Advanced Research Institute Chinese Academy of Sciences Shanghai 201210 PR China Graphical abstract Na-promoted CoMn catalyst is able to produce higher alcohols via syngas with C2+ and C6+ fractions account for >90wt% and ∼50wt%, respectively. CoMn model catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation and evaluated for higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) via syngas. The selectivity to oxygenates (mainly alcohols and aldehydes) was found to be higher than 20C% for the Na-promoted CoMn catalyst. Among the oxygenates, C2+ and C6+ fractions accounted for >90wt% and ∼50wt%, respectively. Metallic Co0 particles and MnCO3 were found in both Na-promoted and unpromoted CoMn catalysts after the reaction, whereas Co2C nanoparticles could only be observed in the spent Na-promoted catalyst. The addition of Na benefited the carbonization of cobalt and increased the selectivity to oxygenates and CO2. Our studies thus suggested that Co/Co2C were the bifunctional dual-sites for the oxygenates formation over the Na-promoted CoMn catalyst, where Co catalyzed CO dissociation and chain propagation, while Co2C was responsible for CO non-dissociative activation and subsequent insertion. In addition, the sole Co2C nanoparticles with certain exposed facets may also act as another kind of active dual-sites for oxygenates formation. Keywords Fischer-Tropsch Higher alcohol synthesis Syngas Co2C Active dual-sites 1 Introduction Higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) via syngas derived from coal, biomass or natural gas has attracted much attention due to the wide potential applications of higher alcohols [1–3]. When higher alcohols are used as fuels, less NOx and SOx are released compared with traditional fuels from petroleum [4,5]. When used as fuel additives, an enhanced octane value can be obtained. In addition, long-chain alcohols (C6+OH) are of even higher value and can be used as feedstocks for producing detergents, plasticizers and lubricants [6–8]. At present, there were four types of HAS catalysts, namely, modified methanol catalysts, Mo-based catalysts, Rh-based catalysts and modified Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalysts [9]. Modified methanol catalysts include alkali modified Cu-Zn-Al2O3 and Zn-Cr2O3 mainly for the formation of methanol and isobutanol. Mo-based catalysts include Mo2S and Mo2C promoted by alkali metals, which are generally used to produce C1 ∼C5 alcohols with low activity. Rh-based catalysts afford high selectivity to C2+ oxygenates (mainly ethanol). However, the high cost and scarcity of the Rh metal hinder its industrial application. Modified FT catalysts for HAS, including modified Co, Fe and Ni catalysts [10], have gained special attention due to the relatively high selectivity to higher alcohols, low cost and wide availability of the precursors. For the modified FT catalysts, the CO insertion mechanism proposed by Xu et al. [11] is widely accepted. Bifunctional dual-sites play an important role in higher alcohol formation. Two types of active sites are needed, where one type dissociates CO to form alkyl species while the other activates non-dissociatively adsorbed CO for its insertion. Among modified FT catalysts, Cu-modified Co catalysts for HAS have been widely investigated since the first report in the late 1970s [12] and some significant progress has been achieved [10,13–21]. It is generally accepted that Cu and Co metallic species in intimate contact as active dual-sites are responsible for alcohol formation. Metallic Co0 is suggested to be the active site for CO dissociation and chain growth for C2+ alkyl chain while Cu for CO insertion to generate C2+ oxygenates including alcohols and aldehydes. However, Cu-modified Co catalysts for HAS exhibit low activity and low stability due to the accumulation of Cu over Co on the catalyst surface during the reaction [22,23]. In addition, the carbon chain growth for the CuCo catalysts is rather weak and little C6+OH can be obtained. Therefore, it is highly desirable to find a substitute to Cu as an effective active site for CO insertion and to improve the stability and the C6+OH selectivity. Recently, several studies disclosed that the formation of cobalt carbide during syngas exposure would improve the oxygenates selectivity [24–30]. Pei et al. [26] and Wang et al. [27] claimed that the Co2C was capable of catalyzing CO non-dissociative adsorption and subsequent insertion to the adjacent CxHy species to form oxygenates. Xiang et al. [24] prepared potassium-promoted CoMn catalysts by co-precipitation using oxalate as the precipitant, and they found that the sum selectivity to aldehydes and alcohols was usually up to 50wt%. The synergic interaction between Mn5O8 and bulk Co2C, promoted by potassium, was considered to be responsible for the high selectivity towards oxygenates. The presence of Mn was found to be helpful in promoting the formation of weak acid sites and to enhance the adsorption of linear- and bridge-type CO significantly, which contributed to the formation of alcohol and growth of carbon chain [31]. Very recently, a Na-promoted CoMn catalyst for Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO) was reported by our group [32]. A strong facet effect of Co2C was illustrated and Co2C nanoprisms with specifically exposed facets of (101) and (020) exhibited extremely high olefins selectivity (80C%) with incredibly low methane selectivity, indicating that Co2C was also capable of dissociative CO adsorption. The addition of alkalis has been proved to promote the carbonization rate of Co and the stabilization of the Co2C specie [33]. Further studies found that the increase in the reaction pressure would result in increasing oxygenates selectivity. Thus, it was presumed that this Na-promoted CoMn catalyst may be suitable for higher alcohol synthesis under higher reaction pressure. In this paper, CoMn catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation using Na2CO3 or (NH4)2CO3 as the precipitant and evaluated for higher alcohol synthesis from syngas. The influence of the Na content and the reaction conditions were investigated. The structure of the bifunctional dual-sites and catalytic mechanism for oxygenates formation were also discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Two CoMn catalysts with the same Co/Mn atomic ratio of 1/1 were prepared by co-precipitation using sodium carbonate anhydrous (Na2CO3) or ammonium carbonate anhydrous ((NH4)2CO3) as the precipitant, which were denoted as CoMn-SC (Na-promoted CoMn) and CoMn-AC (unpromoted CoMn), respectively. Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 50% Mn(NO3)2 aqueous solutions were used as metal precursors. All reagents were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd and used without further processing. During the co-precipitation process, the 2M metal ion (including Co2+ and Mn2+) solution and 2M Na2CO3 or (NH4)2CO3 solution were added simultaneously into a beaker containing 200mL deionized water under continuous stirring. All solutions were prepared using deionized water. A constant pH of 8±0.1 was used during the precipitation process, and the temperature was kept at 65°C and 30°C for Na2CO3 and (NH4)2CO3 as the precipitant, respectively. The as-prepared suspension solution was aged for 2h, and then centrifuged with deionized water for 6 times. After drying at 100°C for 5h, the samples were calcined in a muffle furnace at 330°C for 3h under static air. CoMn catalysts with different Na loadings were prepared by wet impregnation of CoMn-AC using sodium carbonate anhydrous followed by similar procedures and denoted as CoMn-xNa, in which x stands for the weight percentage of Na in the sample. The calcined catalysts were reduced by 10 vol% of H2/N2 (200mL/min) at 300°C for 300min in a tube furnace. The reactor was then cooled to the room temperature (ca. 19°C), followed by passivation in 1 vol% O2/Ar for 60min. The as-prepared samples were then characterized to reveal the structural properties of the fresh reduced catalyst. 2.2 Characterization An inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Optima 8000, Perkin Elmer) was used to determine the bulk compositions of the CoMn catalysts. Nitrogen adsorption measurements were performed on a Micromerictics TriStar 3020 instrument at −196°C. All samples were degassed at 200°C in vacuum overnight. The specific area was calculated using the adsorption isotherm in relative pressure (P/P 0) ranging from 0.04 to 0.3 by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation. The total pore volume was calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method and the average pore size was determined using the BJH desorption isotherm. XRD patterns for the CoMn catalysts were recorded on a Rigaku diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with the wavelength of 1.54056Å at 40kV and 40mA. All the measurements were performed at ambient temperature. The samples were loaded into a shallow glass holder and levelled on the surface before measurements. The data was collected with a rate of 1°/min in a continuous scanning mode. H2-TPR experiments were carried out on a Micromerictics AutoChem 2920 instrument. About 30mg of sample was purged with 30mL (STP) min−1 He at 120°C for 100min. After cooling to 50°C, the catalyst was exposed to 30mL (STP) min−1 of 5% H2/Ar flow as the temperature ramped to 800°C. The exhaust was analyzed by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed on a JEOL JEM 2011 electron microscope with 200kV accelerating voltage. Samples for TEM were prepared by dispersing the nanoparticles in ethanol followed by ultrasonication. One droplet of dispersion was placed on carbon-coated molybdenum or nickel grids for measurement. 2.3 Catalytic evaluation Higher alcohol synthesis reaction was carried out in a stainless steel continuous flow fixed-bed reactor with an inner diameter of 10mm. 1.5g of the catalyst (40–60 meshes) was mixed with 3.0g of silica (blank experiment proved that silica had no catalytic activity for HAS under current conditions), and then loaded into the reactor. The catalyst was reduced in-situ in 10vol% H2/N2 with GHSV (gas hourly space velocity) of 8000mL (gcat. −1 h−1) at the atmosphere pressure at 300°C for 300min. The gas flow was controlled by a Brooks mass flow meter. After the reactor was cooled to 200°C, the system was pressurized to 2.0MPa with 10 vol% syngas/N2. Then the feed gas was changed into syngas (H2/CO/N2 =65/32/3) with GHSV of 6000mL (gcat. −1 h−1). 3 v% of nitrogen was included in the feed gas as an internal standard. The outlet gas was analyzed on-line by GC after passing through a hot trap (120°C) and a cold trap (0°C) and the liquid and wax products were collected and analyzed off-line by GC. The details of GC analysis were shown in our previous study [10]. All the data were collected after 48h of time-on-stream. 3 Results 3.1 ICP and textural structures The ICP results of the various CoMn samples are shown in Table 1 . The Co/Mn atomic ratios in calcined CoMn catalysts were close to 1, suggesting the complete precipitation of the Co2+ and Mn2+ species during the preparation process. The Na content in CoMn-SC was 0.79wt%, much higher than that in CoMn-AC (no detection of sodium). As shown in Table 1, the specific surface area (S BET) and pore volume were similar after the calcination for all samples. The specific surface area decreased and pore size increased after the reduction, while no obvious changes were found in the pore volume among all samples. Both the pore volume and the diameter of CoMn-AC were higher than those of CoMn-SC. After addition of Na, the pore volume and diameter decreased for the CoMn catalysts. 3.2 XRD Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of the CoMn catalysts at different stages. As shown in Fig. 1A, the main crystalline phases in all calcined samples were Co3O4 and CoMn2O4, and there was also undecomposed MnCO3 in CoMn-AC. After reduction at 300°C (Fig. 1B), CoMn-SC showed diffraction peaks ascribed to CoMn2O4 and CoO, while CoMn-AC and Na-impregnated CoMn catalysts showed diffraction peaks assigned to CoxMn1-xO. For the spent catalysts (Fig. 1C), all catalysts showed diffraction peaks of MnCO3 (JCPDS # 44–1472), cubic Co (JCPDS # 15-0806) and hexagonal Co (JCPDS # 05-0727). The diffraction peaks attributed to Co2C (JCPDS # 65–1457) at 2θ of 41.3, 42.6 and 45.7° were clearly observed in the Na-promoted catalysts, including CoMn-SC, CoMn-0.1Na, CoMn-0.6Na and CoMn-1.2Na, but were absent in CoMn-AC. The XRD patterns of reduced and spent CoMn-SC samples under different reduction temperatures (300°C and 400°C) were also investigated, as shown in Fig. S1 and Fig. S2, respectively. Be different from the diffraction peaks of the CoMn-SC sample reduced at 300 o, the sample reduced at 400°C corresponded to the mixtures of metallic cobalt and MnO (Fig. S1). Co2C, metallic cobalt and MnCO3, however, were found for both spent samples reduced at different temperatures (300°C and 400°C). 3.3 H2-TPR The H2-TPR profiles of various calcined samples are shown in Fig. 2 . Due to the various bulk species as indicated by XRD (Fig. 1B), CoMn catalysts showed somewhat different reduction profiles from each other. There are four strong peaks at 212, 356, 379 and 520°C, respectively, for CoMn-SC. The peak at 212°C for CoMn-SC might stem from the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ and that of Mn3+/Mn4+ to Mn2+, whereas the peak at 356°C might be due to the reduction from Co2+ to Co0 [34]. The peaks at 379 and 520°C might be due to the reduction of Co2+ to Co0 in CoxMn1-xO, since it has been reported that Mn could hinder the reduction of cobalt oxides by forming CoMn composite oxides [34,35]. CoMn-AC showed three main reduction peaks. The two low reduction peaks located at 180°C and 262°C for CoMn-AC might be caused by the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ and Mn3+/Mn4+ to Mn2+ in the absence of Na2CO3 [36]. The impregnation of CoMn-AC with a lower Na loading did not change its reduction profiles significantly except for the two lower reduction peaks, which moved towards higher temperatures, in agreement with a previous report [21]. The reduction peaks at high temperatures for CoMn-AC and Na-promoted CoMn-AC can be attributed to the reduction of Co2+ to Co0. Note that the sample with 1.2wt% Na loading showed some differences in the peak location, as the first two peaks shifted towards lower temperatures and the third peak shifted towards higher temperature with peak width broadening. Obviously, cobalt or manganese oxides in all the CoMn catalysts could not be completely reduced at 300°C in this study, in line with the XRD results of the reduced CoMn samples as shown in Fig. 1B. 3.4 (HR)TEM The (HR)TEM images of CoMn catalysts after the reaction are presented in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that there were large amounts of nanoparticles in sizes ranging from less than 10nm to more than 20nm for CoMn-SC (Fig. 3a). The magnified images of randomly selected area indicated by the red circles in Fig. 3a are shown in Figs. 3b and 3c. The nanoparticles with a lattice spacing of 2.43Å and 2.12Å corresponding to the (101) plane and the (111) plane of Co2C, respectively, were detected. Nearby, there were nanoparticles with a lattice parameter of about 2.15Å, which matches well with the lattice spacing of the (100) plane of HCP Co0. Fig. 3c shows a Co2C nanocrystal particle with the exposed facet of (101). Metallic cobalt (FCC Co0 and HCP Co0) instead of Co2C was observed for the spent CoMn-AC, whereas only Co2C was found to be present after the addition of Na. Some of the Co2C nanoparticles formed were in intimate contact with the metallic Co nanoparticles. We also paid attention to the occurrence of the exposed facets of the Co2C nanoparticles. Except for the (101) and (020) facets, other exposed facets were also observed. For example, the (301) facet was found to coexist in close proximity with the (101) facet in Fig. 3i and the (111) exposed facet was observed in Fig. 3l. Fig. S3 and Fig. S4 show the (HR)TEM images of the reduced and spent CoMn-SC under reduction temperatures, respectively. The particle size of the CoMn-SC sample reduced at 300°C was about 10nm, while that of the CoMn-SC sample reduced at 400°C was as high as 20nm. After reaction, the size of the spent sample reduced at 400°C remained about 20nm and was obviously larger than that of the spent sample reduced at 300°C (10nm). 3.5 Catalytic performances The evolution of activity of CoMn-SC as a function of time on stream was shown in Fig. S5. It can be found that the activity was very low at the initial stage, and it gradually increased with the increase of reaction time. The activity tended to be stable after 12h (100∼110×10−4 molCOgcat −1 h−1). To compare the catalytic performance of various CoMn catalysts at steady stage, the results at 48h were also presented as shown in Table 2 . The CoMn-SC in this study showed a higher oxygenates selectivity (23.5C%), a lower hydrocarbons selectivity and a higher CO2 selectivity (30.5C%). The CoMn-AC, however, showed a much lower selectivity to both oxygenates and CO2, and a higher hydrocarbons selectivity at the same reaction temperature, in agreement with the previous reports on the CoMn catalysts that generated mainly hydrocarbons [37,38]. In order to exclude the effect of the conversion rate on the product distribution, we performed another experiment over CoMn-AC at a lower temperature. As shown in Table 2, with the decline in the reaction temperature from 240°C to 225°C, CO conversion decreased from 22.6% to 12.4% over CoMn-AC, which was close to that over CoMn-SC at 240°C. However, there was no obvious change in the oxygenates selectivity. Therefore, we believed that CoMn-SC was more favorable for oxygenates formation than CoMn-AC. It was remarkable to find that the oxygenates selectivity increased after the addition of Na into CoMn-AC. With the increase of the Na content, the activity of the CoMn catalyst decreased, and the oxygenates selectivity reached a maximum for CoMn-0.6Na. In addition, CO2 selectivity increased gradually with the increase of the Na content while hydrocarbons selectivity exhibited an opposite trend. As far as the oxygenates distribution was concerned, the C2+ and C6+ concentrations in oxygenates were as high as 97.5 and 47.3wt% for CoMn-SC, respectively, effectively suppressing the formation of undesired methanol and increasing the selectivity to more value-added long-chain oxygenates, which was rarely reported for traditional CuCo-based HAS catalysts [17,20]. The oxygenates formed over the CoMn catalysts were mainly n-alcohols and n-aldehydes. The aldehydes/alcohols ratio was much lower in CoMn-AC than in CoMn-SC, the same as the olefins/paraffins ratio, suggesting the higher hydrogenation ability of CoMn-AC than CoMn-SC. With the addition of Na into CoMn-AC, the aldehydes/alcohols ratio increased. The concentration of the C1 ∼C5 slate increased while that of the C6+ slate decreased with the increasing Na content. For the hydrocarbons distribution, CoMn-AC showed a higher methane concentration and a lower olefins/paraffins ratio than CoMn-SC at the same reaction temperature. With the decrease of the reaction temperature, the methane concentration decreased and the olefins/paraffins ratio increased for CoMn-AC probably due to less secondary reactions of olefins, such as re-adsorption and hydrogenation.The olefins/paraffins ratio increased after the addition of Na to CoMn-AC. The methane concentration for the CoMn catalysts increased and the combined selectivity to oxygenates and olefins decreased with the further increase in the Na content. In addition, both the product distributions of oxygenates and hydrocarbons versus the carbon number in all the CoMn catalysts obeyed the classical Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) model as shown in Fig. 4 . The chain growth probability (α) for oxygenates over the studied CoMn catalysts was between 0.50 and 0.72, much higher than that of CuCo catalysts [8,10]. The high chain growth probability made the CoMn catalysts favorable for the formation of C6+ oxygenates. Moreover, CoMn-0.1Na catalysts showed an oxygenate chain growth probability close to that of the hydrocarbons, suggesting the same active sites for the carbon chain growth of both oxygenates and hydrocarbons. The similar phenomenon had been reported for the CuFe catalyst [39]. The catalytic results of CoMn catalysts at different time on streams were also presented as shown in Table S1 and Table S2. There was no significant difference between TOS of 24 and 48h except for the CoMn-1.2Na. It seemed that the catalysts with high sodium loading possessed lower activity, and the activity increased firstly with time on steam and then kept stable. In addition, the catalytic performance of Na-promoted CoMn catalysts was quite stable as shown in Table S2. As CoMn-SC exhibited promising catalytic performance for higher alcohols synthesis, we also studied the effect of the reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of this catalyst. As shown in Table 3 , the activity increased with the temperature due to the increasing rate constant according to the Arrhenius equation. The CO2 selectivity increased with the reaction temperature possibly due to the higher water-gas shift activity at higher temperature. Although the selectivity to hydrocarbons remained constant from 240°C to 250°C, the selectivity to oxygenates decreased due to the increasing CO2 selectivity. Therefore, lower reaction temperature was favorable for oxygenates formation. In addition, the ratios of both aldehydes/alcohols and olefins/paraffins decreased with the reaction temperature, showing that low reaction temperature was favorable for olefins and aldehydes formation. Moreover, the influence of the reaction pressure on the catalytic performance of CoMn-SC was also investigated. It was generally believed that high reaction pressure was favorable for oxygenates formation, but the oxygenates selectivity in this study did not increase significantly from 4 to 6MPa. Instead, the oxygenates selectivity was the highest at 4MPa. With the increase in the reaction pressure, the ratios of both aldehydes/alcohols and olefins/paraffins decreased as shown in Table 3, which might be caused by the higher hydrogenation ability at higher pressure resulting in higher H* concentration over the cobalt particle surface. Furthermore, the effect of reduction temperature on catalytic performance was studied. As presented in Table S3, the sample reduced at 300°C showed higher activity and higher selectivity to oxygenates than that reduced at 400°C. In addition, higher C2+ selectivity in oxygenate distribution was obtained for the sample reduced at 300°C, suggesting that the reduction temperature of 300°C was more suitable for higher alcohol synthesis than higher reduction temperature of 400°C. 4 Discussion The CoMn catalyst was prepared by co-precipitation using sodium carbonate anhydrous (Na2CO3) as the precipitant and evaluated for higher alcohols synthesis via syngas in this study. The catalytic performances of the as-prepared CoMn-SC catalyst under typical HAS conditions showed that they produced a considerable amount of oxygenates with more than 90% of the C2+ fraction and about 50% of the C6+ fraction among the oxygenates. Such product distribution was completely different from traditional Cu-modified Co-based catalysts [40,41], which produced mainly C1 ∼C5 alcohols. For traditional modified FT catalysts for HAS, Cu is always seen as the site for CO non-dissociative activation and insertion. Previous studies tried to prepare CuCo alloy or CuCo core-shell structures to improve the proximity of Cu and Co in order to increase oxygenate formation [3,10,17–19,21]. However, Cu-modified Co catalysts for HAS possess low activity and low stability [22]. In addition, the carbon chain growth probability for Cu-modified Co catalysts was low and few C6+ long chain oxygenates were produced due to the enrichment of Cu on the catalyst surface. In contrast, the present CoMn catalyst was found to be highly effective for the HAS reaction, indicating that it may not necessary to use copper as the non-dissociative active site over modified cobalt catalysts for HAS. In addition, we prepared another CoMn catalyst with the same Co/Mn ratio using (NH4)2CO3 as the precipitant and found that the prepared CoMn-AC catalyst showed a much higher activity and lower oxygenate as well as CO2 selectivity than CoMn-SC, suggesting that the precipitant might play a significant role in the catalytic performance of CoMn catalysts. Keyser et al. [42] prepared CoMn catalysts using ammonia hydroxide as the precipitant and found a low oxygenate selectivity similar to that for the CoMn catalyst prepared using (NH4)2CO3 as the precipitant in this study. However, they did not investigate the structure evolution of the catalyst during the reaction. In this study, although the activity of CoMn-AC was tuned to the value similar to the CoMn-SC, the product selectivity and distribution still showed tremendous differences, indicating significant structural difference between these two catalysts. In order to elucidate the active sites for higher alcohol synthesis, we characterized the spent catalysts and correlated the catalyst structure with the catalytic performance. The XRD patterns and HRTEM images of the spent CoMn-SC showed that the dominant phases are the Co metal, Co2C and MnCO3. MnOx or MnCO3 has been proved to be inactive for CO hydrogenation to FTO and HAS in our blank experiments [32]. In fact, the observation of Co2C and its influence on higher alcohol synthesis has been reported and discussed by other researchers [25–30,43–45]. Density functional theory calculations [26] proved that Co2C was able to activate CO without dissociation. We thus propose that Co and Co2C constitute the active dual-sites over the CoMn catalyst, where Co serves for CO dissociative adsorption and subsequent carbon-chain growth, while Co2C functions for CO non-dissociative adsorption. Although it was generally believed that Co2C was not active for CO dissociation, our previous work [32] did show that Co2C with preferentially exposed (101) and (020) facets could dissociate CO to generate olefins with high selectivity. In this study, the Co2C nanoparticles were found to expose the facets including (101), (111), (020), and (301) (Fig. 3). DFT calculations performed by Pei et al. [26] found that the activation energies for H-assisted dissociation of CO to CH* and O* on Co-terminated Co2C(110) and Co2C(111) were 1.86eV and 2.12eV, respectively, and those on C-terminated Co2C(110) and Co2C(111) were 2.00eV and 2.77eV, respectively, indicating that the activation energies for CO dissociation over the various Co2C facets were quite different. In our previous study [29], the sole Co2C derived from 1%Na-Co/SiO2 catalyst was found to catalyze the formation of higher alcohols. However, no metallic Co was detected by XRD and TEM characterization. Therefore, it was suggested that the Co2C nanoparticles with certain exposed facets might also act as another kind of active dual-sites for oxygenates formation. The Co2C facets with lower activation energy for CO dissociation might act as active site to form the alkyl species, while other facets with higher activation energy for CO dissociation were responsible for CO insertion. Long chain oxygenates were generated at the interface between two adjacent Co2C facets with distinct CO dissociation energies. In addition, Co2C was not observed in the spent CoMn-AC. We therefore concluded that the difference between CoMn-AC and CoMn-SC in the catalytic performance was mainly due to the Co2C particles. The characterization of the catalyst composition by ICP-OES and that of the textural structure by N2 physical adsorption (Table 1) showed that the Co/Mn atomic ratio, surface area and pore volume of CoMn-SC were similar to CoMn-AC. However, there was a small amount of Na (0.79wt%) remained in CoMn-SC, and there was no Na in CoMn-AC. The selectivity to oxygenates was reported to increase by doping Co-based catalysts with alkali metal compounds [46,47]. Anton et al. [21] studied the effects of Na on the structure and performance of cobalt-modified Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts and found that high Na loadings (≥0.8wt%) led to increased carbonization of metallic Co0, resulting in bulk Co2C formation, which generated additional active sites for HAS. During the investigation of oxalate-precipitated CoMn catalysts for straight- and long-chain aldehydes/alcohols and olefins/paraffins, Xiang et al. [24] noted that the formation of bulk Co2C was associated with alkali metals. Our previous work demonstrated that both Na and K had a similar effect on the formation of Co2C, whereas other alkalis such as Li or Rb, was not beneficial for the carbonization of Co and the oxygenates formation, although the basicity of catalysts was improved [33]. Also, Na has been reported to lead to a higher extent of iron carbonization in iron-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [48]. Therefore, we attributed the presence of Co2C in the spent CoMn-SC catalyst to Na remaining in the catalyst during the catalyst preparation, which could promote the carbonization of the cobalt particles. With some metallic cobalt species transformed into Co2C, the catalytic activity of the CoMn catalyst decreased at the same reaction conditions as shown in Table 2, since Co2C showed a lower activity than Co0 [32,49,50]. As a result, Co/Co2C and the sole Co2C particles as discussed above constituted the dual active site for higher alcohol synthesis, which resulted in the enhanced oxygenate selectivity of CoMn-SC than CoMn-AC. To further investigate the significant influence of Na on the catalytic structure of the CoMn catalysts, we prepared the CoMn catalyst by impregnation of CoMn-AC with various amount of sodium carbonate anhydrous. The oxygenate selectivity over the CoMn catalyst (Table 2) was found to increase significantly after impregnation with sodium ions, and to reach the maximum at 0.76wt% loading of Na, suggesting that the basic properties over the catalyst surface by Na modification was one of the main reasons for the increased selectivity to higher alcohols. The XRD and TEM characterizations indicated that Co2C particles only appeared in these spent Na-promoted catalysts, suggesting alkali ions could promote the carbonization of cobalt particles and lead to bulk Co2C particles. In addition, the peak intensity of Co2C at 41.28°, 42.57° and 45.75° seemed to increase first and then decreased slightly. The maximum peak intensity of Co2C was obtained at the sodium concentration of 0.15∼0.76wt%, which was constant with our previous study [33]. Consequently, the increase in the oxygenate selectivity over the Na-promoted CoMn catalyst was suggested to be related to the occurrence of the Co2C particles, which was formed in the presence of Na during the reaction. We also noted that Na-promoted CoMn catalysts led to much higher concentration of CO2 than CoMn-AC. Considering that there were Co2C particles in Na-promoted CoMn catalysts, we ascribed the high concentration of CO2 to the high water-gas-shift (WGS) reactivity of Co2C particles. Gnanamani et al. [51] reported that Co2C was active for the low temperature WGS reaction, and our previous work [32] also showed high CO2 selectivity when Co2C nanoprisms were formed over the CoMn catalysts for FTO. Therefore, Na definitely had an important influence on the structure evolution of the CoMn catalysts during the reaction, and the high selectivity to CO2 was expected when high loading of Na was added, resulting in the enhanced formation of Co2C particles. Based on the results of influence of reduction temperatures, Co2C, metallic cobalt and MnCO3 were found for both spent samples reduced at different temperatures (300°C and 400°C). However, the particles size for the spent sample reduced at 300°C was smaller than that at 400°C. It was reasonable to infer that the smaller particles would lead to more intimate contact for different components and enhanced synergistic effect for oxygenates formation. In our further work, DFT calculations on CO non-dissociative/dissociative adsorption on certain exposed facets of Co2C will be carried out to further investigate the inter-crystalline plane effects. The structural evolution at the initial stage during the reaction and the deactivation mechanism of this Na-promoted CoMn catalyst will also be investigated. 5 Conclusion A series of Cu-free CoMn catalysts with different Na loadings were prepared and applied to higher alcohol synthesis via syngas. High selectivity towards total oxygenates (alcohols and aldehydes) of more than 20C% was obtained with high C2+ and C6+ fractions, which were >90wt% and ∼50wt% among the oxygenates, respectively, over the Na-promoted CoMn catalysts. However, the unpromoted CoMn catalyst displayed a much higher activity with the suppression of oxygenates and CO2 formations. XRD and HRTEM results revealed that the metallic Co0 particles and MnCO3 existed in all the spent catalysts, both Na-promoted and unpromoted. The exclusive occurrence of bulk Co2C nanoparticles in the spent Na-promoted catalysts indicated that Na played an important role in the carbonization of cobalt in CoMn catalysts, which led to the enhanced selectivity to oxygenates and CO2. The structure-performance relationship was investigated, and the bifunctional dual-sites for the oxygenates formation were found to be Co/Co2C and sole Co2C nanoparticles. Both metallic Co0 particles and certain Co2C facets with relative low activation energies for CO dissociation were capable of CO dissociation, resulting in alkyl chain formation, while other Co2C facets with higher activation energies for CO dissociation were responsible for CO non-dissociative adsorption and insertion, resulting in oxygenates formation. Further investigation of the reaction pressure and temperature showed that low temperature and proper pressure were favorable for the formation of oxygenates.

        "dc:description": "CoMn model catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation and evaluated for higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) via syngas. The selectivity to oxygenates (mainly alcohols and aldehydes) was found to be higher than 20C% for the Na-promoted CoMn catalyst. Among the oxygenates, C2+ and C6+ fractions accounted for >90wt% and ∼50wt%, respectively. Metallic Co0 particles and MnCO3 were found in both Na-promoted and unpromoted CoMn catalysts after the reaction, whereas Co2C nanoparticles could only be observed in the spent Na-promoted catalyst. The addition of Na benefited the carbonization of cobalt and increased the selectivity to oxygenates and CO2. Our studies thus suggested that Co/Co2C were the bifunctional dual-sites for the oxygenates formation over the Na-promoted CoMn catalyst, where Co catalyzed CO dissociation and chain propagation, while Co2C was responsible for CO non-dissociative activation and subsequent insertion. In addition, the sole Co2C nanoparticles with certain exposed facets may also act as another kind of active dual-sites for oxygenates formation.",
