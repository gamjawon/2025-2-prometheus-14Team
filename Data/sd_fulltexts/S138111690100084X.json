Tel.: +1-203-432-3925; fax: +1-203-432-6144 New syntheses of PEG-(OCH2C5H4N)2 and PEG-(OC6H4PPh2)2 (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) conjugates are reported. An iridium hydrogenation catalyst 1, is shown to catalyze hydrogenation in a water/substrate two-phase system. Attachment of 1 to PEG to make 2 and 3 succeeds in making the complex water-soluble and allows it to retain some of its catalytic ability, but leads to micelle formation that inhibits the separation of organic and aqueous phases. Keywords PEG–iridium conjugates Conjugates Catalyst Two-phase catalysis 1 Introduction With the rise of ‘green chemistry’ there is increased emphasis both on homogeneous catalysis and on ways to avoid organic solvents in catalytic reactions [1]. In water/organic two-phase systems, water soluble catalysts do work, but can give low turnover frequencies (TOF). Dror considers cosolvents necessary for acceptable hydrogenation rates [2]. Slow diffusion of substrate into the water phase is considered to be the main problem. Rhône Poulenc have reported a successful substrate/water two-phase hydrogenation without cosolvents, using ruthenium and rhodium Tris(m-sulfonatophenyl)phosphine complexes [3,4]. Our cationic iridium hydrogenation catalysts of type [(cod)Ir(PR3)py]PF6 may have advantages for this application. They are water-stable and have high activity. Although the precursors have no significant water solubility, they can form aqua complexes as intermediates and, thus, become somewhat water soluble during turnover. Some stable aqua complexes of this type have been isolated (e.g. [(H2O)2IrH2(PR3)2]PF6) and even structurally characterized. These aqua species not only have enhanced water-solubility, but can undergo deprotonation to give neutral, potentially organic-soluble species. For simplicity and comparability, we used [(cod)Ir(PPh3)py]PF6 (1) or its PEG-bound equivalents throughout. Water-solubilization of a metal complex can often be achieved by attachment to a water-soluble polymer [5–7]. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is commonly used because of its solubility properties; it is soluble in water and some organic solvents, e.g. CH2Cl2 and DMF, but can be precipitated with other organic solvents, e.g. Et2O and hexane [8,9]. These solubility properties potentially allow PEG-based catalysts to undergo phase transfer, which is in turn expected to give improved catalytic activity in two-phase systems. 2 Experimental Unless otherwise noted, all manipulations were conducted under an atmosphere of nitrogen using standard Schlenk techniques. The solvents were dried by common procedures. Water was deoxygenated by purging with nitrogen for 30min. (cod)IrCl(PPh3) and [(cod)Ir(py)2]PF6 were prepared according to literature procedures [10,11]. All other reagents were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. NaH was a 60% weight dispersion in mineral oil. All PEG-derived polymers were stored under nitrogen in the dark. NMR spectra were recorded in CD2Cl2 on a GE Omega 300MHz spectrometer. 31 P -NMR chemical shifts were referenced to an external standard (85% H3PO4). GC/MS analyses were made on a HP-5971A MSD interfaced to a HP-5890 Series II GC with a fused silica capillary column. 2.1 Preparation of PEG-(OC6H4PPh2)2 We have prepared this material by three different routes. The term PEG-X2 implies that the X group is present at both ends of the linear PEG polymer. 2.1.1 Mitsunobu procedure via PEG-(OC6H4I)2 The first Mitsunobu step is based on a procedure described by Bittner and Assaf [12]. A mixture of PEG-3400 (5.0g, ca. 1.5mmol), p-iodophenol (1.0g, 4.5mmol), PPh3 (1.4g, 5.4mmol), and diethyl azodicarboxylate (0.85ml, 5.4mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (40ml) was stirred at room temperature for 12h. The yellow solution was concentrated to ca. 15ml and added dropwise to Et2O (ca. 200ml). The white precipitate (PEG-(OC6H4I)2) that formed was filtered (medium frit), washed with Et2O (3×20ml), and dried. Yield=95%. 1 H -NMR: 7.54 (d, C6H4), 6.70 (d, C6H4), 3.58 (m, PEG CH2). The second step follows a coupling strategy by Stelzer [13]. To a solution of PEG-(OC6H4I)2 (2.5g, ca. 0.66mmol) in acetonitrile (35ml) was added NEt3 (0.25ml, 1.8mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (2mg, 8.9μmol), and HPPh2 (0.31ml, 1.8mmol). The mixture was heated to 45°C for 12h and then at 80°C for another 12h. After cooling, the resulting red solution was added dropwise to degassed Et2O. The white precipitate was filtered, washed three times with degassed Et2O, three times with degassed iPrOH, and dried in vacuo. Yield=95%. 1 H -NMR: 7.30 (m, Ar), 6.93 (d, Ar), 4.13 (α CH2 PEG), 3.58 (m, PEG CH2). 31 P -NMR: −6.7 (Ph2PC6H4). No starting material was present (NMR). 2.1.2 Mitsunobu procedure via 4-iodophenol p-Hydroxyphenyldiphenyl phosphine (prepared according to [13]) was attached to PEG-3400 by the Mitsunobu procedure described above. Yield=95%. The 1 H and 31 P -NMR data were identical to those reported above. 2.1.3 Substitution procedure via PEG-(OTs)2 To a cooled (ice bath) solution of PEG-3400 (50g, ca. 15mmol) in CH2Cl2 (100ml), was added p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (11.5g, 60mmol) and pyridine (10ml, 120mmol) with stirring. The solution was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirring was continued for 24h. The solution was then concentrated to ca. 60ml and added dropwise to Et2O (ca. 600ml). The white precipitate was filtered and washed three times with Et2O (3×50ml). The dried solid was suspended in toluene (500ml). The mixture was filtered and the filtrate evaporated. The residue was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (50ml) and the solution was added dropwise to Et2O. The PEG-(OTs)2 that precipitated was filtered, washed with Et2O, and dried in vacuo. Yield=85%. 1 H -NMR: 7.76 (d, C6H4), 7.35 (d, C6H4), 3.58 (m, PEG CH2), 2.43 (s, CH3). To a solution of p-hydroxyphenyldiphenyl phosphine [13] (0.6g, 2.2mmol) in CH2Cl2 (10ml) was added NaH (0.1g, 2.4mmol). After stirring for 10min, the suspension was filtered and the filtrate was added to a solution of PEG-(OTs)2 (3.7g, ca. 1.0mmol) in CH2Cl2 (30ml). After stirring for 12h, the solvent was evaporated. Toluene (100ml) was added to the residue and the mixture was stirred for 30min. The mixture was filtered and the filtrate evaporated to leave a residue that was then dissolved in CH2Cl2. This solution was added dropwise to Et2O. The precipitated solid was filtered, washed with Et2O, and dried in vacuo. Yield=95%. The 1 H and 31 P -NMR data were identical to that reported above. Seventy six percent conversion to PEG-(OC6H4PPh2)2 as determined by comparison of PEG-(OTs)2 C6H4 doublet at 7.8ppm to PEG-(OC6H4PPh2)2 C6H4 doublet at 6.93ppm. 2.2 Preparation of PEG-(OCH2C5H4N)2 To a solution of 4-pyridylcarbinol (0.55g, 5.0mmol) in DMF (30ml), was added NaH (0.16g, 4.1mmol). After stirring for 1h, the resulting red solution was added slowly to a solution of PEG-(OTs)2 (3.40g, ca. 1.0mmol) in DMF (30ml). After stirring for 12h at room temperature, water (20ml) was added while the reaction mixture was cooled with an ice bath. The mixture was first extracted with Et2O and then with CH2Cl2. Only the CH2Cl2 extracts were collected. The CH2Cl2 extracts were concentrated to ca. 15ml and added dropwise to Et2O. The white solid was filtered, washed with Et2O, and dried. Yield=95%. 1 H -NMR: 8.52 (d, py), 7.26 (d, py), 4.56 (s, CH2), 3.59 (m, PEG CH2). No impurities observable by NMR. 2.3 Preparation of PEG-(OC6H4PPh2)2–iridium conjugate 2 To a solution of [(cod)Ir(py)2]PF6 (0.10g, 0.18mmol) in CH2Cl2 (2ml) was added a solution of PEG-(OC6H4PPh2)2 (0.31g, ca. 0.08mmol) in CH2Cl2 (5ml). The orange solution was stirred for 30min and then concentrated to 2ml. The solution was filtered and the filtrate was added dropwise to Et2O (20ml). The orange solid was filtered and dried in vacuo. Yield=95%. 1 H -NMR: 8.22 (py), 7.43 (Ar), 7.21 (py), 7.08 (C6H4O), 4.44 (m, vinyl cod), 3.60 (m, PEG CH2), 2.5–1.9 (allyl cod). 31 P -NMR: 16.6 (s, Ph2PC6H4), −143.9 (septet, PF6 −). No impurities observable by NMR except doublet at 8.64ppm from [(cod)Ir(py)2]PF6 py. Eighty-five percent conversion determined by comparison of product doublet at 8.22ppm to [(cod)Ir(py)2]PF6 doublet at 8.64ppm. 2.4 Preparation of PEG-(OCH2C5H4N)2–iridium conjugate 3 To a solution of AgPF6 (0.09g, 0.36mmol) in acetone (3ml) was added slowly a solution of (cod)IrCl(PPh3) (0.22g, 0.37mmol) in acetone (15ml). After stirring for 5min, the mixture was filtered and the filtrate was added to a solution of PEG-(OCH2C5H4N)2 (0.5g, ca. 0.15mmol) in CH2Cl2. This mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1h. The solvent was evaporated and CH2Cl2 (20ml) was added. The solution was filtered through celite and the filtrate was concentrated to 5ml. The red solution was added dropwise to Et2O. The orange red solid was filtered and dried in vacuo. Yield=95%. 1 H -NMR: 8.14 (d, py), 7.48 (m, Ph), 7.14 (d, py), 4.47 (m, vinyl cod), 4.40 (s, CH2), 3.60 (m, PEG CH2), 2.4–1.7 (allyl cod). 31 P -NMR: 17.5 (s, Ph3P), −144.0 (septet, PF6 −). No impurities observable by NMR. 2.5 Typical hydrogenation procedure The PEG–iridium conjugate (0.092g, 18μmol, 0.5mol.%) was dissolved in water (5ml) under N2 in a 50ml Schlenk flask equipped with a septum. Allylbenzene (1ml, 7.5mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred vigorously, while H2 (1atm) was bubbled via a septum. The H2 outlet needle was removed after the flask had filled with H2. The progress of the reaction was followed by removing 0.1ml of the organic layer after fixed times with a syringe, extracting with Et2O, and analyzing by GC/MS. 3 Results and discussion PEG-(OC6H4PPh2)2 has previously been synthesized by Wentworth and Janda [14] and by Kim [15]. The Wentworth–Janda procedure requires protection and deprotection steps for the synthesis of p-hydroxyphenyldiphenylphosphine. PEG-3400 is converted to its methanesulfonyl derivative and then coupled to p-hydroxyphenyldiphenylphosphine. Five steps are needed in total. Kim reports a one-pot method of synthesizing PEG-(OC6H4PPh2)2 from PEG-3400 via deprotonation of PEG with K/naphthalene and addition of (4-bromophenyl)diphenylphosphine, but significant phosphine oxidation occurs during isolation. Soluble, polymer-bound phosphines have been synthesized recently for use in fluorous [16], two-phase organic [17], and aqueous [18] systems. The phosphines of all of these polymers, however, are alkyldiphenylphosphines; their electronics differ appreciably from triphenylphosphine. We have developed three high-yield procedures for the synthesis of high-purity PEG-(OC6H4PPh2)2 which require only two or three steps. Method 1, shown in Eq. (1), begins with a Mitsunobu reaction between PEG-3400 and p-iodophenol, followed by a Pd-catalyzed coupling between the resulting PEG-(OC6H4I)2 and diphenylphosphine. When, the coupling reaction was stopped after only 5h of heating at 80°C, C6H4 protons from the p-iodophenol starting material were still present ( 1 H -NMR resonances at 7.54 and 6.70ppm). Heating at 80°C for an additional 7h gives a product having a spectrum with PEG-(OC6H4PPh2)2 aromatic protons only (7.30 and 6.93ppm). The α-methylene PEG protons (PEG-(OCH2CH2OC6H4PPh2)2) are also seen (4.13ppm) along with the intense PEG methylene resonance (3.58ppm). The 31 P -NMR spectrum shows no evidence of phosphine oxide. The second method is identical except for the order of the Mitsunobu and P -aryl coupling steps (Eq. (2)). Both methods require only two steps. (1) PEG-(OH)2 → CH 2 Cl 2 PPh 3/DEAD IC 6 H 4 OH PEG-(OC 6 H 4 I)2 → NEt 3 MeCN Pd(OAc)2 HPPh 2 PEG-(OC 6 H 4 PPh 2)2 (2) IC 6 H 4 OH → NEt 3 MeCN Pd(OAc)2 HPPh 2 HOC 6 H 4 PPh 2 → CH 2 Cl 2 PPh 3/DEAD PEG-(OH)2 PEG-(OC 6 H 4 PPh 2)2 The third method (Eq. (3)) requires two steps from HOC6H4PPh2, which must be synthesized via Eq. (2). The product shows evidence of PEG-(OTs)2 starting material in the PEG-(OC6H4PPh2)2 1 H -NMR at 7.8ppm, but gives the 1 H -NMR with the fewest spectroscopically apparent impurities. PEG-(OTs)2 is formed from the reaction between PEG-3400, p-toluenesulfonyl chloride, and pyridine. PEG-(OC6H4PPh2)2 is then made by the reaction of PEG-(OTs)2 with the sodium salt of p-hydroxyphenyldiphenylphosphine. The product NMR data from all three of our methods are consistent with those reported in [14]. (3) PEG-(OH)2 → CH 2 Cl 2 p-TsCl/py PEG-(OTs)2 → CH 2 Cl 2 NaH HOC 6 H 4 PPh 2 PEG-(OC 6 H 4 PPh 2)2 The reaction between [(cod)Ir(py)2]PF6 and PR3 has been studied extensively. In the presence of one equivalent of PR3, [(cod)Ir(py)2]PF6 undergoes substitution to give [(cod)Ir(PR3)py]PF6 (Eq. (4)) [10]. The cod allyl and vinyl protons are no longer equivalent causing extra resonances to appear in the 1 H -NMR. A color change from yellow to red–orange is observed. (4) [(cod)Ir(py)2]PF 6 → acetone/EtOH PR 3 [(cod)Ir(PR 3)py]PF 6 By analogy with the chemistry of Eq. (4), PEG-(OC6H4PPh2)2 can be combined with [(cod)Ir(py)2]PF6 to give 2. The 1 H -NMR spectrum of the product does indeed show the same aromatic and cod peaks found for [(cod)Ir(PPh3)py]PF6, but it also shows free [(cod)Ir(py)2]PF6 (the extra 12.5% that was in excess of stoichiometric ratio plus 15% that did not react) is precipitated along with 2 ([(cod)Ir(py)2]PF6 py resonance at 8.64ppm). This should not affect catalysis, though, because it has been shown that [(cod)Ir(py)2]PF6 is ineffective as a hydrogenation catalyst [19]. The 31 P -NMR spectrum shows only peaks at 16.6ppm for the phosphine bound to iridium and −143.9ppm for the PF6 − anion; no phosphine oxide resonance is observed. PEG-(OCH2C5H4N)2 was prepared from a substitution reaction between PEG-(OTs)2 and the sodium salt of 4-pyridylcarbinol (Eq. (5)). This is the same approach used in the third method of the synthesis of PEG-(OC6H4PPh2)2 (Eq. (3)). (5) PEG-(OH)2 → CH 2 Cl 2 p-TsCl/py PEG-(OTs)2 → DMF NaH HOCH 2 C 5 H 4 N PEG-(OCH 2 C 5 H 4 N)2 It is known that in the presence of an excess of pyridine and a PF6 − salt, (cod)IrCl(PR3) will undergo substitution and counterion exchange to give [(cod)Ir(PR3)py]PF6 (Eq. (6)) [10]. Use of AgPF6 facilitates the reaction because Ag precipitates the chloride. (6) [(cod)IrCl(PR 3)] → MeOH AgPF 6 excesspy [(cod)Ir(PR 3)py]PF 6 To prepare 3, (cod)IrCl(PPh3) is treated with AgPF6 in acetone which serves to activate it by conversion to [(cod)Ir(acetone)(PPh3)]PF6 in which the acetone is a much better leaving group than the original chloride. The acetone could then be replaced by the pyridine of PEG-(OCH2C5H4N)2. The PEG bound pyridine is not in excess as Eq. (6); this is probably, why conversion to the intermediate acetone complex is needed in the PEG case. The py peaks in the 1 H -NMR shift upfield indicating coordination of Ir and no py peaks from uncoordinated PEG-(OCH2C5H4N)2 remain. Complexes of type [(cod)Ir(PR3)py]PF6 are known to be excellent hydrogenation catalysts in CH2Cl2, especially, where R=cyclohexyl or isopropyl [19,20]. Upon addition of H2, cod is hydrogenated and lost leaving active sites for hydrogen to oxidatively add and for substrate to bind. Turnover frequencies of 6400 (mol reduced product/mol catalyst×h) can be achieved with 1-hexene. 1–3 were tested for hydrogenation activity in a water/allylbenzene two-phase system. Use of allylbenzene as a substrate allowed hydrogenation and isomerization to be monitored. Aliquots of the organic layer were removed every 30min for 2.5h, extracted with ether, and analyzed by GC/MS to determine product ratios. As shown in Table 1 (b), 1 hydrogenates allylbenzene in a water/substrate two-phase medium with a maximum TOF of 62h−1. This can be compared with a conventional hydrogenation in CH2Cl2 which gives a TOF of 187h−1 (Table 1(a)). The fact that 1 does not dissolve appreciably in water does not inhibit catalysis and only increases the amount of time needed for at least 92% hydrogenation/isomerization by 90min. Considering the possible presence of protonation/deprotonation equilibria, we looked at the effect of running the catalysis in the presence of either p-TsOH or N(CH2CH2OH)3. The presence of acid or base did not seem to affect catalysis rates, implying that protonation/deprotonation is not critical. Addition of PEG-3400 to the two-phase system causes the maximum TOF to drop to 50h−1 (Table 1(c)). The water layer takes on a cloudy appearance. Although PEG is soluble in water, salt trapped in the PEG can cause PEG precipitation and micelle formation. 2 and 3 were less active still than the noncovalently linked 1/PEG mixed system with maximum TOFs of 23 and 21h−1 respectively (Table 1(d) and (e)). The micelle formation problem is worsened with 2 and 3 because the iridium complexes themselves are salts. The extent of micelle formation in the reaction mixture when 2 or 3 were used made separation of organic and aqueous layers impossible. Conjugate 2 was more active than 3, and also appeared to be more stable with time, even though the two are essentially identical except for the point of attachment of the PEG. Presumably, the PEG-(OC6H4PPh2)2 ligand binds best and retains the metal in the conjugate, while the IrN bond can dissociate. 4 Conclusion We have described an improved synthesis of PEG-(OC6H4PPh2)2 and syntheses of PEG-(OCH2C5H4N)2 and PEG–Ir conjugates of types 2 and 3. We have also shown that catalyst 1 is suitable for two-phase operation in a water/substrate mixture and that 2 and 3 possess limited hydrogenation activity.
