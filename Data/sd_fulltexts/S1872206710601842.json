The structure of the catalysts was characterized us- ing X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction. Toluene was chosen as a model compound to evaluate the catalytic activity in a conventional fixed-bed quartz reactor. The results indicate that Cu-Co-O was present when the Cu content was low. CuO diffraction peaks were observed when the Cu content was high. Both Co 2+ and Co 3+ exist on the surface of the obtained monolithic catalysts while Cu 2+ is the main Cu species. The addition of a certain amount of copper oxide improved the reducibility of the cobalt oxide, which enhanced the catalytic activity of the catalysts. All the obtained catalysts showed good activity for the catalytic combustion of toluene. The Cu 0.5 Co 0.5 /Al 2 O 3 /cordierite catalyst showed the best catalytic activity. Toluene was completely oxidized at 315 Â°C. Key words: copper; cobalt; cordierite; monolithic catalyst; toluene; catalytic combustion Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted from nu- merous industrial sources and they have long been a typical source of air pollution [1]. Their release into the atmosphere causes serious environmental problems [2]. Therefore, the removal of these pollutants has been an important research topic over the last 30 years [3]. Catalytic combustion is one of the most promising technologies for the removal of VOCs because of the low temperature required for combustion igni- tion, high selectivity, and high energy efficiency [4,5]. Sup- ported noble metals and metal oxides are two types of cata- lysts used widely for the catalytic combustion of VOCs. Vari- ous reports have shown that supported Pt and Au have excel- lent activity for the complete oxidation of VOCs [6]. However, the high cost of noble metals has led to the development of base metal catalysts for this application. Recently, many reports have been published on cop- per-containing catalysts for the catalytic oxidation of VOCs. Karthik et al. [7] reported the catalytic oxidation of VOCs over a Cu-Al-MCM-41 catalyst and found that Cu-Al- MCM-41 was an efficient catalyst because of the presence of well dispersed and isolated Cu 2+ ions on the catalyst. Chen et al. [8] synthesized a series of CuO catalysts supported on ce- rium-modified and zirconium-pillared montmorillonite (CuO/CZM) and studied their performance for the total oxida- tion of toluene. Their results showed that the CuO/CZM cata- lyst is a promising candidate for industrial-scale VOC elimi- nation. Lu et al. [9] prepared a series of transition-metal cata- lysts using activated carbon (AC) as the support material and copper, cobalt, iron, nickel as the catalytic active phases. Monolithic catalysts have increasingly attracted the attention of researchers. They are used in many new reactor applica- tions such as chemical processing, refining industries, and in catalytic combustion [10]. Compared with conventional cata- lysts, the monolithic catalysts have distinct advantages such as better mechanical strength, lower mass and heat transfer ca- pacity, and lower thermal expansion coefficients [11]. There- ZHAO Fuzhen et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 821â€“826 fore, monolithic catalysts are promising for reactions with a high space velocity and a large amount of heat exchange such as the toluene combustion reaction. In this work, a series of copper-cobalt mixed oxide catalysts with different Cu/Co ratios and washcoated on cordierite monoliths were investigated. The performance of the obtained catalysts for toluene catalytic combustion was evaluated and the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR). 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation Commercial cordierite with a cell density of 400 cpsi (62 cells/cm 2 ) was cut to obtain samples with a diameter of 8 mm and a length of 50 mm. The obtained cordierite samples were then pre-treated with a 20% oxalic acid solution and boiling for 3 h. The samples were washed with deionized water and finally calcined at 300 Â°C for 3 h. The Cu x Co 1-x /Al 2 O 3 /cordierite (x = 0â€“1) catalysts were prepared as follows: solutions of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 Â·3H 2 O and Co(NO 3 ) 2 Â·6H 2 O were mixed in appropri- ate ratios. The mixture was added to the boehmite primer sol to obtain a total 40 wt% metal content in the slurry. The cordierite was then inserted into the above slurry and held for 10 min. It was then dried at room temperature in air and thereafter at 120 Â°C for 3 h and then calcined at 500 Â°C for 4 h. The coating procedure was repeated to achieve the desired amount of coating. Finally, the Cu x Co 1-x /Al 2 O 3 /cordierite monolithic catalysts were obtained. 1.2 Catalyst characterization The phase structure of the samples was characterized by XRD using a Rigaku D/Max 2500 VB2+/PC diffractometer with Cu K Ä® radiation operating at 200 mA and 40 kV. XPS experiments were carried out on a Thermo Electron ES- CALAB 250 instrument using Mg K Ä® as the excitation radia- tion at a constant pass energy of 30 eV. Binding energies were calibrated using the carbon that was present as a contaminant (C 1s = 285.0 eV). The surface atomic compositions of all the samples were calculated from the photoelectron peak areas for each element after a correction for instrument parameters. The morphology of the samples was observed using a Japan HI- TACHI S-4700 scanning electron microscope. H 2 -TPR meas- urements were carried out using a Thermo Electron TPD/R/O 1100 series catalytic surfaces analyzer equipped with a TCD detector. The sample (0.08 g) was loaded and preheated with a 10% O 2 -90% He mixture at 500 Â°C for 1.5 h. After cooling to room temperature, a 5% H 2 -95% N 2 mixture was introduced into the instrument and the temperature was increased to 800 Â°C at a heating rate of 5 Â°C/min. The water produced by the sample reduction was condensed in a cold trap before reach- ing the detectors. Only H 2 was detected in the outlet gas con- firming the effectiveness of the cold trap. 1.3 Catalytic activity measurements Catalytic combustion experiments were performed in a conventional fixed-bed quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure. The reactant gas mixture was prepared by passing air through a conical flask filled with liquid toluene, which was kept at 0 Â°C. The reaction feed consisted of 0.1% toluene in dry air and the space velocity was 5.6 Ã— 10 4 ml/(gÂ·h). The reaction was stabi- lized for 20 min at the required temperature and the outlet products were measured using on-line gas chromatography (Beijing East & West Electronics Institute, GC-4000A) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The tem- perature was controlled with a K-type thermocouple placed in the vicinity of the catalyst bed. Carbon dioxide and water were always the only reaction products detected during these experiments. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 XRD The XRD patterns of the pretreated cordierite and Cu x Co 1-x /Al 2 O 3 /cordierite monolithic catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. For the pretreated cordierite support, the characteristic peaks at 2È™ = 10.4Âº, 18.0Âº, 19.0Âº, 21.6Âº, 26.3Âº, 28.4Âº, 29.4Âº, 33.9Âº, 36.8Âº, and 54.2Âº were present and these correspond to the ce- ramic structure [12]. The Co 3 O 4 phase cannot be detected by XRD because of the congruence of the Co 3 O 4 and cordierite diffraction peaks. To further confirm the phase of the Cu x Co 1-x /Al 2 O 3 /cordierite catalysts, the Cu x Co 1-x /Al 2 O 3 sol was characterized by XRD 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 2T/( o ) Cordierite Cordierite I n t e n s i t y CuO x = 0.1 x = 0 x = 0.25 x = 0.5 x = 0.75 x = 0.9 x = 1 Fig. 1. XRD patterns of the Cu x Co 1-x /Al 2 O 3 /cordierite samples. ZHAO Fuzhen et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 821â€“826 and the result is shown in Fig. 2. The position of the main diffraction peaks at 2È™ = 31.20Âº, 36.84Âº, 44.63Âº, 59.46Âº, and 65.35Âº correspond to Co 3 O 4 (JCPDS 42-1467) for x = 0. With the addition of Cu the main diffraction peaks showed a small shift. Using the intensity 2È™ peak at 36.84 o as an example: the d value for the (311) plane is 0.24428 nm for x = 0 (Table 1); for x = 0.5 the d value for the (311) plane is 0.24519 nm; for x = 0.75 the d value for the (311) plane is 0.24534 nm. This is because the radius of Cu 2+ (0.062 nm) is bigger than that of Co 3+ (0.052 nm), which leads to an expansion of the Co 3 O 4 lattice when Cu 2+ migrates partially into the cubic structure. Therefore, changes in the d 311 value around 0.001 nm for the samples indicate that the missing CuO phase at low Cu loading is in- corporated into the Co 3 O 4 lattice to form a Cu-Co-O solid solution [13]. The formation of the Cu-Co-O solid solution has been frequently reported in the literature [14,15]. When x > 0.5, the most intense peaks of bulk CuO at 2È™ = 35.5Â°, 38.7Â°, and 48.6Â° [16] were detected. 2.2 XPS The XPS spectra of Cu 2p for the catalysts with x = 1, 0.25, and 0.1 are shown in Fig. 3(a). The peak centered at about 933.1 eV represents Cu 2p 3/2 . The presence of a higher Cu 2p 3/2 binding energy (933.0â€“933.8 eV) and the pronounced shake-up peak (940.0â€“945.0 eV) are two major characteristics of CuO while a lower Cu 2p 3/2 binding energy (932.2â€“933.1 eV) and the absence of the shake-up peak are characteristic of Cu 2 O [17,18]. After the Gauss model fitting of our catalysts, we noticed that the given catalysts had a Cu 2p 3/2 main peak at about 933.2 eV with a characteristic shake-up peak, which indicates the existence of a Cu 2+ species in the catalysts. The Co 2p spectra of the catalysts with x = 0.1, 0.5, and 0 are shown in Fig. 3(b). All the Co species in these samples are characterized by two main peaks (2p 3/2 at about 780.5 eV and 2p 1/2 at about 796.2 eV) with a spin-orbit splitting of about 15.0 eV. Since the Co 2p binding energies of Co 2+ are similar to that of Co 3+ , satellite peak information must be considered to distinguish the two oxidation states of cobalt. It is generally accepted that energy gaps between the Co 2p main lines and the satellite peaks are highly related to the oxidation states of the Co cation. According to previous reports, the high spin Co 2+ compounds have strong satellite peaks and the binding energies are located at about 5â€“6 eV above the Co 2p 3/2 main line. Low spin Co 3+ compounds have very weak satellite peaks and these shift to higher binding energies by about 10â€“11 eV from the main peak [19,20]. Based on the binding energies of the Co 2p main lines and the energy gaps between the main lines and the satellite peaks, we conclude that both Co 2+ and Co 3+ exist on the surface of the obtained monolithic catalysts. Table 1 lists the binding energies of Cu, Co, Al, O and the surface atomic percentages of all the samples. Mg and Si ele- ments are not present in the cordierite support according to the XPS results, which means that the cordierite surface was fully covered by the active coating. For the Cu/Al 2 O 3 /cordierite catalyst, the surface atomic content of Cu was found to be 3.24% and it shows a small decrease with an increase in Co. For x = 0.5, the surface atomic content of Cu was found to be the highest among the prepared catalysts.

ZHAO Fuzhen et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 821â€“826 surface atomic content of Co was also the highest. No signifi- cant differences among the binding energies of the different samples were observed for Al and O but the surface composi- tion varied among the different samples. 2.3 Surface morphology of the samples Figure 4 shows the morphology of the Cu x Co 1-x /Al 2 O 3 /cor- dierite monolithic catalysts. The surface morphology changed significantly with the x value. For the catalyst with x = 1, namely Cu/Al 2 O 3 /cordierite, the surface was quite homoge- nous. The particle sizes were almost equivalent. However, the surface morphology of the catalysts changed greatly with a decrease in Cu content. For x = 0.9, the surface was smoother and the particles were smaller. For x = 0.75, the catalyst also had a smooth surface but several cracks were found. For x from 0.5 to 0.1, the surface was very smooth and no cracks were found. For an x of 0, the surface was found to differ from the other catalysts and the dispersion was inhomogeneous while the particle heap was loose. 2.4 Catalytic activity Figure 5 shows the catalytic activities of toluene oxidation with reaction temperature for the Cu x Co 1-x /Al 2 O 3 /cordierite catalysts. The Cu/Co ratio has a significant influence on the catalytic activity of the catalysts. The catalytic activity of toluene oxidation over either Cu/Al 2 O 3 /cordierite (x = 1) or Co/Al 2 O 3 /cordierite (x = 0) was quite low. For x = 1, T 10 (the temperature for 10% conversion of toluene) and T 90 (the tem- perature for 90% conversion of toluene) was 242 Â°C and 339 Â°C, respectively, while for x = 0, T 10 and T 90 were 265 Â°C and 353 Â°C, respectively. Wang [21] reported on the catalytic combustion of toluene over CuO/È–-Al 2 O 3 catalysts. They found that 5%CuO/È–-Al 2 O 3 showed the highest catalytic activity and its T 90 was 320 Â°C at a space velocity of 3600 ml/(gÂ·h). Con- sidering that the space velocity in our experiment was 5.6 Ã— 10 4 ml/(gÂ·h), the Cu/Al 2 O 3 /cordierite monolithic catalyst gave much better catalytic performance. The Cu x Co 1-x /Al 2 O 3 /cordierite (x = 0.1â€“0.9) catalysts gave higher catalytic activities than the x = 1 or x = 0 catalysts. This indicates a synergistic effect between CuO and Co 3 O 4 , which Table 1 XPS and XRD results of the Cu x Co 1-x /Al 2 O 3 /cordierite catalysts Banding energy a (eV) Atomic concentration (%) Sample Cu 2p 3/2 Co 2p 3/2 Al 2p O 1s Cu 2p 3/2 Co 2p 3/2 Al 2p O 1s d 311 b /nm x = 1 932.9 â€” 74.2 531.0 3.24 â€” 42.70 54.06 â€” x = 0.9 933.1 780.5 74.2 530.9 3.06 1.52 43.52 51.90 â€” x = 0.75 932.8 780.2 74.3 531.0 2.72 1.03 40.40 55.85 0.24534 x = 0.5 932.8 780.3 74.2 531.0 3.53 2.51 44.89 49.07 0.24519 x = 0.25 933.0 780.4 74.4 531.1 2.13 1.71 40.42 55.74 0.24467 x = 0.1 933.1 780.5 74.5 531.1 0.71 1.71 42.64 54.94 0.24441 x = 0 â€” 781.8 74.3 531.3 â€” 1.98 40.80 57.22 0.24428 a Corrected using the C 1s peak at 285.0 eV. b The d 311 values of Co 3 O 4 were obtained from XRD.

ZHAO Fuzhen et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 821â€“826 implies that the Cu-Co-O solid solution is the active phase for toluene oxidation. Li et al. [22] also suggested that Cu-Mn-O was responsible for the toluene combustion reaction in Cu-Mn/MCM-41 catalysts. For x = 0.5, the catalyst gave the best catalytic activity with a toluene conversion of 10% at 234 Â°C. The toluene was completely oxidized at 315 Â°C. However, a further increase in the Cu content (x > 0.5) resulted in a de- crease in catalytic activity. XRD showed that CuO peaks were present at x > 0.5, which suggests that the presence of bulk CuO depressed the catalytic activity. 2.5 H 2 -TPR Figure 6 shows the H 2 -TPR profiles of the Cu x Co 1-x /Al 2 O 3 / cordierite monolithic catalysts. Three reduction peaks are present at about 206, 260, and 318 Â°C for the Cu/Al 2 O 3 /cordierite catalyst (x = 1). The reduction temperature is markedly lower than that of pure CuO, which has a reduction peak at about 420 Â°C, suggesting that the redox properties of CuO are significantly affected by the interaction with the support. Based on a previous report, the two lower reduction peaks represent the reduction of small CuO clusters and the peak at 286 Â°C is attributed to the reduction of bulk CuO par- ticles [23]. It is obvious that a different reduction profile is observed with an increase in cobalt oxide loading suggesting that the strong interaction between surface cobalt oxide and surface copper oxide improves the reducibility of the copper oxide. For the sample with x = 0.9, the two reduction peaks at lower temperature may be attributed to the stepwise reduction of Cu 2+ , and the two higher temperature peaks are assigned to the stepwise reduction of Co 3+ [24]. For the samples with x = 0.75â€“0.1, the low-temperature peaks resulted because of sur- face copper oxide reduction and the high-temperature peaks are assigned to surface cobalt oxide reduction. Three reduction peaks were present for the Co/Al 2 O 3 /cordierite catalyst (x = 0). The peak at 372 Â°C should correspond to the reduction of highly dispersed or small crystallite Co 3 O 4 to CoO, and the peak at 477 Â°C is due to the reduction of CoO to metallic Co. The peak at 608 Â°C represents the reduction of well-defined bulk Co 3 O 4 to metallic Co [25]. 3 Conclusions Cu x Co 1-x /Al 2 O 3 /cordierite monolithic catalysts were pre- pared using cordierite as a support and with Al 2 O 3 as a wash- coat. In the Cu x Co 1-x /Al 2 O 3 /cordierite monolithic catalysts, the catalytic activities of the catalysts were strongly influenced by the Cu/Co ratios. Cu 0.5 Co 0.5 /Al 2 O 3 /cordierite showed the highest catalytic activity. Toluene was completely oxidized at 315 Â°C with a GHSV of 5.6 Ã— 10 4 ml/(gÂ·h). Using cordierite as a support benefited the dispersion of Cu. A CuO phase was ob- served at a higher Cu content. When x < 0.5, the Cu-Co-O solid solution formed on the monolithic catalysts and was responsible for the catalytic combustion of toluene. The XPS results showed that both Co 2+ and Co 3+ existed in the obtained monolithic catalysts and Cu existed mainly as the Cu 2+ species. Since no Mg or Si was found in the cordierite support using XPS, the cordierite surface was fully covered by the active coating. The introduction of copper oxide changed the reduc- tion profile of cobalt substantially suggesting that the strong interaction between surface cobalt oxide and copper oxide improved the reducibility of the cobalt oxide.

Tel: +86-10-64419619; Fax: +86-10-64419619 A series of Cu x Co1-x /Al2O3/cordierite (x = 0–1) catalysts were prepared using cordierite as a support, a boehmite primer sol as the first washcoat layer and copper as well as cobalt oxides as the activity washcoat layer. The structure of the catalysts was characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction. Toluene was chosen as a model compound to evaluate the catalytic activity in a conventional fixed-bed quartz reactor. The results indicate that Cu-Co-O was present when the Cu content was low. CuO diffraction peaks were observed when the Cu content was high. Both Co2+ and Co3+ exist on the surface of the obtained monolithic catalysts while Cu2+ is the main Cu species. The addition of a certain amount of copper oxide improved the reducibility of the cobalt oxide, which enhanced the catalytic activity of the catalysts. All the obtained catalysts showed good activity for the catalytic combustion of toluene. The Cu0.5Co0.5/Al2O3/cordierite catalyst showed the best catalytic activity. Toluene was completely oxidized at 315 °C. 摘要 摘要：以堇青石蜂窝陶瓷为基底, Al2O3 浆料为过渡胶体, Cu 和 Co 为催化活性组分, 制备了一系列 Cu x Co1-x /Al2O3/堇青石 (x = 0−1) 整体式催化剂. 采用 X 射线衍射、X 射线光电子能谱、扫描电镜和程序升温还原等手段对催化剂进行了表征. 以甲苯为模型化合物, 在微型固定床反应器上评价了催化剂的催化性能. 结果表明, 当 Cu 含量较低时, 在整体式催化剂上形成了Cu-Co-O 固溶体; 当 Cu 含量较高时, 可以检测到 CuO. 在催化剂表面, Co 以 Co2+ 和 Co3+ 形式存在, 而 Cu 主要以 Cu2+ 形式存在. 适量 Cu 的加入可以改善催化剂中 Co 的氧化还原性能, 有利于催化剂活性的提高. 在所制备的催化剂中, Cu0.5Co0.5/Al2O3/堇青石整体式催化剂活性最高, 在315 oC 可以完全催化燃烧消除甲苯.
