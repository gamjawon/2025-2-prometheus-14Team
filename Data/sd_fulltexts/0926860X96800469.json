II. Effects of sul- phur. Sulphur is a significant poison for com- mercial bimetallic catalysts, while the most frequently used HDS catalysts consist of a supported mixture of MoS2 with Co or Ni. These systems are complex, containing several interacting phases, and so it is of interest to examine much simpler anal- ogues consisting of thin films of one metal, X, on a transition metal substrate, M (see Part I). In this way it is found that transfer of electron density between X and M sta- bilises the X-M bond, regardless of the direction in which the charge moves. With Zn on the close-packed Mo(110) plane, for instance, the stabilisation amounts to about 40 kJ mo1-1 relative to the Zn-Zn bond. The general effect of sulphur is to weaken bimetallic bonding, one S atom producing long-range perturbations and diminishing the bonding capacity of sev- eral substrate atoms. With X = Cu, Ag, or Zn on the close-packed Ru(0001) surface, the X-Ru bond is weaker than the S-Ru bond and, on heating, the admetal desorb- s while at higher temperatures S both desorbs and diffuses into the bulk. On the other hand, in the S/Au/Ru(0001) system the Ru bonds to Au and S are similar in strength and Au compresses S into islands of high local coverage. This produces a reduction in the S-Ru bond strength so that on heating there is complete desorp- tion of S with no diffusion into the bulk. In more extreme cases, the strength of the bimetallic bond is reduced to such an ex- tent ( 30 kJ mo1-1) that it falls below that of the X-X bond and, instead of wetting the substrate, the admetal X collects into iso- lated three dimensional globules on the surface. This behaviour is observed with S and Cu, Ag orZn on Mo(110) [M. Kuhn and J.A. Rodriguez, Surf. Sci., 336 (1995) 1]. The mechanism of the S-X-M interac- tion is unclear but it seems that the stronger the S-M bond the weaker the admetal- substrate bond. A movement of charge would be expected in the direction of sul- phur because of its very high electronega- tivity and this is confirmed in the case of Zn on Mo(110) by XPS binding energy shifts and quantum mechanical calculations. The result is a reduction in electron transfer from Mo towards the region around the bimetallic bond that makes an important contribution to the Zn-Mo bond energy. A second feature of sulphur interaction with certain X/M combinations, including Cu and Ag on Pt(111) and Cu, Ag, and Zn on Mo(110), is promotion of bulk sulphida- tion of the substrate by the admetal [J.A. Rodriguez and M. Kuhn, J. Phys. Chem., 99 (1995) 9567; M. Kuhn and J.A. Rodri- guez, Catal. Lett., 32 (1995) 345 and J. Catal., 154 (1995) 355]. For example, des- pite the high stability of bulk molybdenum sulphides, the interaction of S2(g) with Mo(110) at 300-700 K produces only a monolayer of S which desorbs again above 1200 K. Thus, penetration of S into the solid must involve a large kinetic bar- rier, due in part to the very low surface free energy of S compared with Mo. When zinc is present on the Mo(110) surface, how- ever, S2(g) at 300 K produces zinc sul- phides and chemisorbed sulphur and ex- posure of either Zn/Mo(110) or Zn.S/Mo(110) to S2(g) at 600-700 K leads to sulphidation of the molybdenum sub- strate. It is suggested that the admetal, X, pro- vides sites where S2(g) can dissociate. Once S(ad) is formed, sulphidation of M applied catalysis A: General Volume 136 No. 2 -- 14 March 1996 Nll will be favoured when the sulphides of M are more stable than those of X and when the surface free energy of X is less than that of M. In addition, penetration of S into the bulk will be facilitated when the cohesive energy of the substrate is low. In bimetallic catalysts containing Pt, it appears that the relative stabilities of the sulphides is the dominant factor determining whether or not the second metal promotes Pt sulphi- dation. C.S. McKee Catalysis -- How Big is Too Big? The size of a recent issue (11/12/95) of CA Selects Plus Catalysis (Applied & PhysicalAspects) caused the above ques- tion to be considered. This issue contained 127 pages of abstracts that will appear in Chemical Abstracts that are related to ap- plied and physical aspects of catalysis. During a year 26 issues of CA Selects Plus are published. Counting the number of ab- stracts contained on several pages indi- cated that about 10 abstracts are con- tained per page. Taking an average of 100 pages per issue and 10 abstracts per page means that 26,000 abstracts on catalysis will ap- pear in 1995. For those of us who are not super speed readers, even allowing for ten seconds to absorb what is in an abstract will require morethan 70 hours, almost two weeks, of our time. When one looks at the list of topics in the CA Selects~CA Selects Plus series one becomes overwhelmed at the potential for scanning abstracts on catalysis. Included in the listing are the following topics that emphasize catalysis: Metallo Enzymes & Metallo Coenzymes; Oxidation Catalysis, Phase Transfer Catalysis; Photocatalysis; Surface Analysis; Surface Chemistry (Physicochemical Aspects), Synfuels; Ze- olites; Alkylation & Catalysis; Batteries & Fuel Cells; Catalysis (Applied & Physical Aspects); Catalysis (Organic Reactions); Catalyst Regeneration; Catalytic & Kinetic Analysis; Coal Science & Process Chem- istry; Enzyme Applications; and Enzyme Analysis. The management of Chemical Abstracts strives to provide complete coverage of catalysis in two of CA Se- lects/CA Selects Plus: Catalysis (Applied & Physical Aspects) and Catalysis (Or- ganic Reactions). The latter also provides coverage of biocatalysis. Thus, one should obtain a reasonable coverage of catalysis literature by reading these two CA Selects. For the slow readers we are now up to about one month per year reading abstracts on catalysis. We would all be 'lost' without Chemical Abstracts to assist us in keeping up with the literature. Some may therefore see any comment that is even remotely critical of Chemical Abstracts and its continuing rapid expansion as being akin to attacking 'motherhood and apple pie'. However, one is impressed at the duplication in some entries. As an example, we find on page 121 of the 11/12/95 issue, abstract 1995:925113 entitled \"Applications of NMR techniques for studying coking of FCC catalysts\" by J.L. Bonardst, M.C. Barrage and J. Fraissard. This abstract includes the abstract that was submitted by the authors to be included in the Book of Abstracts for the 210th ACS National Meeting. Six and one-half lines of the abstract were utilized to identify the title, authors, their organiza- tion and the place the abstracted material appeared. The technical aspects of the abstract take another 10 lines, and is applied catalysis A: General Volume 136 No. 2 -- 14 March 1996 APCATA 96800469 0926-860X(96)80046-9 10.1016/0926-860X(96)80046-9 News brief The bimetallic bond.
