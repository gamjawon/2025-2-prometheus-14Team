Tin(IV) phosphate showed higher catalytic activity than the corresponding zirconium and titanium phosphates for the ketalization of cyclohexanone with 1,2-ethanediol. Among the various forms of the phosphates of tin, zirconium and titanium, the catalytic activities decreased in the following order: amorphous > calcined > crystalline. The reaction was extended to other ketones and diols to obtain their ketals in high yields. Metal(IV) phosphates of tin, zirconium and titanium in different morphological forms, viz. amorphous, calcined and crystalline, have been used as catalysts for selective ketalization of ketones. A comparative study of the catalysts for the aforementioned reaction has been carried out to understand the effect of the composition and morphology on their catalytic activity. Keywords Solid acid catalysts Tetravalent metal acid salts Metal phosphates Ketals 1 Introduction The protection of carbonyl group is sometimes necessary in the manipulation of organic molecules with multiple functional groups. Cyclic acetals and ketals are the most useful protective groups for the carbonyl functionality [1]. Acetals and ketals are generally prepared from carbonyl compounds and alcohols in the presence of acid catalysts. The commonly used catalysts are sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid [1,2]. These catalysts cause corrosion and are not environment-friendly. Therefore, it is desirable to use solid acid catalysts which are free from the previous disadvantages. Recently, diethoxyethane (acetal), which can be used as a diesel additive for the improvement of cetane number, has been prepared from acetaldehyde and ethanol using a variety of heterogeneous catalysts e.g. montmorillonite, mordenite, sulfonic ion exchange resin and zeolitic and amorphous FCC catalysts [3]. We have applied metal(IV) phosphates as solid acid catalysts for selective ketalization of carbonyl compounds. Metal phosphates have the general formula MIV(HXO4)2·nH2O where MIV=Sn, Ti, Zr, Ce, Th and X=P, As, W, Mo and possess both, Broensted and Lewis acid sites. These compounds have been reported as solid acid catalysts for dehydration of alcohols [4], double bond isomerization in alkenes [5] and Friedel Crafts reaction [6]. Earlier, we have applied tetravalent metal phosphates of tin, zirconium and titanium as catalysts for selective cyclodehydration of diols to cyclic ethers [7,8] and hydration of nitriles to amides [9]. Herein, we report, for the first time, application of these catalysts in different morphological forms viz. amorphous, calcined and crystalline for selective ketal formation from the carbonyl compounds and, 1,2- and 1,3-diols. 2 Experimental 1 H NMR spectra were recorded as CDCl3 solutions on a Varian FT 200 spectrometer using TMS as an internal standard. Gas chromatographic analysis was performed on Datalab GC 900 series instrument with a flame ionization detector. A 15m long capillary column, AT-wax (Alltech, USA) and nitrogen as a carrier gas were used. The amorphous (SnPamp, ZrPamp and TiPamp) and crystalline (SnPcry, ZrPcry and TiPcry) catalysts were prepared by the procedure reported earlier [7,8]. The calcined catalysts (SnPcal, ZrPcal and TiPcal) were prepared by thermal treatment of the corresponding amorphous samples in a muffle furnace at 400°C for 6h. The catalysts were characterized by elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, XRD, surface area and pore volume determination, and acidity measurement by temperature programmed ammonia desorption as reported in our earlier work [7,8]. A typical procedure for ketalization reaction is as follows: a mixture of cyclohexanone (100mmol), 1,2-ethanediol (100mmol), SnPamp catalyst (1.54mmol, based on tin) and toluene (45cm3) were taken in a round bottom flask fitted with a Dean–Stark apparatus to remove the water continuously from the reaction mixture. The contents were refluxed for the specified periods as shown in the tables. The progress of the reaction was monitored by GC analysis of the small aliquots withdrawn at half an hour intervals. The ketals were isolated by the following procedure. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and the catalyst filtered off. The filtrate was extracted with water (3×20cm3) in a separatory funnel to remove the unchanged diol. The organic layer was dried (MgSO4) and the solvent removed on a rotary evaporator. The residue was subjected to vacuum distillation to remove the unchanged ketone. The residue after distillation gave nearly pure ketal as shown by thin layer chromatography over silica gel plates. Their structures were confirmed by 1 H NMR spectra. 3 Results and discussion Ketalization of cyclohexanone with 1,2-ethanediol was studied in order to optimize the reaction conditions and to compare the activity of the catalysts. The results are shown in Table 1 . Use of cyclohexanone to SnPamp catalyst mole ratio of 65:1 gave high yield of the corresponding ketal (entry 1). Lowering the amount of catalyst to half resulted in decrease in the yield of the ketal (entry 2). However, doubling the amount of catalyst has practically no effect on the yield (entry 3). Therefore, ketone to catalyst mole ratio of 65:1 was used in all other reactions. Increase in the mole ratio of cyclohexanone to 1,2-ethanediol from 1:1 to 1:1.3 led to high yield (90%) of the ketal (entry 4). Reactions were complete in 3h; there was no further increase in the yield on continuing the reaction up to 6h. These conditions were used for reactions with all the catalysts to compare their catalytic activities. Amongst the three forms, the activity decreased in the following order: SnP>ZrP>TiP (entries 4–12). This is shown graphically in Fig. 1 for the amorphous catalysts. The reason for the higher activity of SnP is its high surface area and higher number of acid sites as compared to ZrP and TiP catalysts. Moreover, SnPamp has more number of stronger acid sites as compared to ZrPamp and TiPamp [7]. Similar trends were observed in the reaction of cyclodehydration of 1,4-butanediol [8]. For a given metal, the amorphous form has the highest activity while the crystalline ones showed the lowest. The calcined samples exhibited activity, which was intermediate between the two (Table 1). This variation of activity among the three forms can be explained on the basis of their surface area and number of acid sites. Crystalline samples have lower surface area and less number of acid sites as compared to the amorphous form [4,8] and therefore show lower catalytic activity. Calcination of the amorphous catalysts reduces its surface area and also there is a small decrease in the total acidity of the catalyst, which is responsible for relatively lower activity of the calcined catalysts [8]. This comparison is shown in Fig. 2 for SnP catalysts in different forms. Clearly, amorphous catalyst shows higher activity than the corresponding calcined and crystalline catalysts. Similar trends were observed for the corresponding ZrP and TiP catalysts which are not shown graphically. Since SnPamp showed the highest activity, it was applied as catalyst for the reactions with other substrates (Table 2 ). To see the effect of the diol variation, 1,2-ethanediol, 2,3-butanediol and 1,3-butanediol were used for the ketalization of cyclohexanone. 1,2-Ethanediol and 2,3-butanediol gave high yield of the corresponding ketals (entries 1 and 2). 1,3-Butanediol which affords six membered ring ketal, gave slightly lower yield (entry 3). Under these conditions, the reaction of acetophenone and 1,2-ethanediol gave moderate yield of the ketal (entry 4). An increases in the reaction time to 6h has no significant effect on the yield (entry 4). However, increase in the amount of diol led to significant enhancement in the yields of the ketal (entry 5). Propiophenone, afforded the corresponding ketal in high yield (entry 6). The reaction was extended to benzaldehyde, which gave its acetal in good yield (entry 7). In all the reactions, ketals were obtained as the only products attesting to the high selectivity of the reaction. 4 Conclusion The tetravalent metal acid salts described herein are novel and selective heterogeneous catalysts for the preparation of ketals from ketones. Amorphous tin(IV) phosphates, which exhibited the highest activity, shows potential for future development as a practical catalyst for ketalization. References [1] T.W.
