The presence of Cu(II) salt was required for the catalytic cycle at atmospheric pressure. Presumably, Cu(II) salt plays an important role for the stabilization of the palladium intermediate. On the other hand, the 2,3,3',4'-isomer (1) was mainly formed with the Pd(II)/Cu(II)/2,4-pentanedione system. The coupling reaction of benzene-dg was carried out with bis(2,4-pentanedio- nato)palladium. The deuterium atom abstracted from benzene-d^ migrated to the chelated 2,4-pentanedionato ligand, giving 3-deuterated 2,4- pentanedione. Introduction The Pd-catalyzed coupling reaction of aromatic compounds has been shown to be a useful method for the synthesis of biaryls [1, 2]. The dimeri- zation of dimethyl phthalate (DMP) was carried out under oxygen pressure to give 2,3,3',4'-tetramethyl biphenyltetracarboxylate (1) and the 3,4,3',4'- isomer (2) in a 1:1 ratio. During the course of screening the catalyst for 2, we have found that the l,10-phenanthroline(phen)/palladium system [3] effectively produced coupling products under much lower oxygen partial pressure than that previously reported [4]. However, partial decomposition of the Pd chelate complex was observed during the reaction. We have now explored a new approach to develop the reaction in combination with Cu(II) salt at atmospheric pressure. On the other hand, the formation of 1 *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/86/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 58 can be achieved using the Pd(II)/Cu(II)/2,4-pentanedione (acacH) catalyst system. The coupling of DMP gives, in principle, three isomers, 1, 2, and the 2,3,2',3'-isomer (3), but 3 was formed only in traces [4], for steric reasons.

A 500 ml turbine-stirred autoclave (sus 316) was used for the pressurized experiments. Palladium acetate [5], Pd(OAc)2, and bis(2,4-pentanedionato)- palladium [6], Pd(acac)2, were prepared following the literature. Bis(2,4- pentanedionato)copper [7], Cu(acac)2, was prepared from cupric acetate and acacH. Preparations of phenPd(NC>3)2 [8] and phenPdCl2 [9] were made by the modified procedures described below. phenPd(NO^h 2.128 g (20 mmol) of Pd black was dissolved in 10 ml of concentrated nitric acid, and diluted with 80 ml of water. To this aqueous solution, filtered, was added a solution of 3.964 g (20 mmol) ofphen'HzO in ethanol (40 ml).

To this filtered aqueous solution was added a solution of 0.991 g (5 mmol) ofphen-H^O in ethanol (20 ml).

To this solution, filtered, was added a solution of 3.964 g (20 mmol) of phen-H20 in ethanol (80 ml). The color of the solution turned blue. After stirring for 1 h, the ethanol was evaporated to dryness and the residue was washed with benzene (150 ml) and dried in vacuo. Yield 7.061 g (98%).

The coupling reaction was conducted in a 300 ml (or 500 ml for Figs. 1 and 2) four-necked round flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, a thermometer and a gas inlet tube which had a G 2 sintered glass filter at the end. In a typical experiment (No. 3 in Table 1), a mixture of 90 mg (0.4 mmol) of Pd(OAc)2, 79 mg (0.4 mmol) of phen-HzO, 24 mg (0.12 mmol) of Cu(OAc)2-H20, and 100 ml (119 g) of DMP was stirred (500 rpm) and an air stream (300 ml (min)\"1) was continually bubbled through the solution. After heating at 200 C for 6 h in an oil bath, GC analysis showed the presence of 0.70 g (0.59%) of 1 and 10.40 g (8.74%) of 2 in the reaction mixture. No black precipitates were observed. A mixture of 20 ml benzene-dg (Merck, 99% ^) and 2 g of Pd(acac)2 was shaken at 150 C for 5 h under an initial air pressure of 50 atm [3]. The GC analysis indicated the presence of C^De (W =84, r = 2.33), CoDsOCOCHs (M-^141, r = 0.02), CeDsCgDs (M-^ = 164, r = 1.00), C6DsC6D40COCH3 (M4' = 221, r = 0.02), three isomers of CfpsCifi^C^Ds (M\"1\" = 244, r = 0.44) and unknown products (M\"1' = molecular ion at 70 eV; r = relative ratio of the peak area). 2,4-Pentanedione-di and biphenyl-dio were detected in the reaction mixture by GC-MS measurement (Hitachi GC 663 - Hitachi M 80 B instru- ment operating at 10 eV ionizing voltage). No fragmentation took place in the case of biphenyl; however, 2,4-pentanedione exhibited fragment ions. Deuterated 2,4-pentanedione: m/e (relative intensity), 102 (28.8), 101 (68.3), 100 (80.5), 86 (67.4), 85 (100.0), 44 (37.7), 43 (91.9). Deuterated biphenyl: 165 (24.7), 164 (100.0), 163 (88.7), 162 (30.6), 161 (7.5), 160 (2.3). In the control experiment using 1 ml of 2,4-pentanedione and 10 ml benzene-de without Pd(acac)2 under the same conditions, biphenyl was not formed and deuterated 2,4-pentanedione was not observed. 2,4-Pentanedione: 101 (9.8), 100 (81.7), 86 (5.3), 85 (84.9), 44 (2.2), 43 (100.0). Deuterated 2,4-pentanedione formed was distilled out from the reac- tion mixture and characterized by its ^ NMR spectrum (JEOL FX-200 spectrometer, ca. 1% solution in C^Dg, TMS as internal standard). The ratio of the integrated intensity of the CH (enol, 5 = 4.92) to that of the CHa (enol, 5 = 1.59) proton was 0.08, while the ratio was 0.17 for the 2,4-pentanedione obtained from the control experiment. The ratio of the integrated intensity of the CHa (keto, 5 = 1.63) to that of the CHa (enol, 5 = 1.59) proton was 0.18. The corresponding ratio for the control experiment was 0.19. 60 Results Reactions at atmospheric pressure We reported a facile coupling procedure of DMP using Pd(OAc)2 in combination with phen under mild partial oxygen pressure to give 2 selec- tively [3]. The quantities of trimers and byproducts were increased, as the conversion of DMP was elevated more than 25%. Thus, our experiments were carried out in the range of 10 -15% yield of dimers. Cu(II) salts have been utilized as an effective oxidant for the Pd-catalyzed reaction [10 - 12]. We developed the coupling reaction in the presence of cupric acetate under various partial oxygen pressures (pO^), using a 5/95 ((^N2) gaseous mixture. The maximum yield of 2 was found at pO; = 0.2 atm, in the range of 0.05 - 1.2 atm of partial oxygen pressure. Clearly, the reaction proceeds smoothly at atmospheric pressure of air. The absence of Cu(II) salt causes precipitation of metallic Pd during the reaction. However, addition of appropriate amounts of Cu(OAc)2-H20 to the solution of the phen/Pd system promotes the catalytic reaction, in which no black precipitates were observed. The phen ligand migrates between Pd and Cu atoms, and thus almost the same yield of 2 was obtained in the catalyst system composed of Pd(OAc)2 and phenCu(OAc)2 (No. 9 in Table 1) as compared to the catalyst system com- posed of phenPd(OAc)2 and Cu(OAc)2-H20. Addition of large amounts of Cu(II) salt did not enhance the reaction and deactivated an active species of the Pd complex, probably due to the exchange of phen between Pd and Cu coordination spheres. Previously, the phen/Pd 1:1 complex was desig- nated as the active species in the formation of 2, and the presence of excess phen afforded the induction period in the formation of 2.

As shown in Table 2, the higher concen- tration of the catalyst increased the apparent yields of 2, however, decreasing the turnover number (moles of 2 per mol of Pd used). On the other hand, enhanced turnovers were obtained when the reaction was conducted by stepwise addition of the catalyst during the reaction (Table 3). In the course of the investigation of Pd compounds other than Pd(OAc)2 for this coupling reaction, complexes of both phenPd(N03)2 and phenPdCl^ gave comparable yields of the products. Sodium acetate was added to the latter complex 62 because a prolonged induction period was observed, indicating that Cl atom was strongly bound to Pd atom. Kinetics To investigate the role of Cu(II) salt in the coupling reaction, we have measured the initial turnover per min of 2 (k^) as a function of molar ratios of Cu/Pd and reaction temperatures. In the kinetic measurements, Cu(acac)2 was used in place of Cu(OAc)2'H20, because of its higher solubility in DMP. Both Cu(II) salts showed comparable effects (Table 1). A plot of turnovers of 2 vs. time yields a straight line at the initial stage (~90 min), and k^ was determined from the slope. When the concentration of Cu(II) salt was varied from 4 X 10~5 M to 2 X 10~3 M, with all other parameters kept constant, k-i remained approximately constant in the range of 0.01 - 0.5 for the molar ratios of Cu/Pd (Fig. 1), indicating that the Cu(II) concentration is independent of the rate of the formation of 2 at the initial stage. The Arrhenius plot yields a straight line in the range 180 - 220 C (Fig. 2) and free energy of activation (AE*) for the formation of 2 was calculated to be 17.9kcalmor1. 100 50 20 10 05 , 0 01 02 03 04 05 molar ratio of Cu/Pd 04 -02 20 21 22 I X 103(K\"') Fig. 1.

A high yield of 1 was obtained when the molar ratio of Cu/Pd was 5:1. Higher ratios of Cu/Pd retarded the reaction, although no black precipitates were observed during the reaction. 2,4-Pentanedione (acacH) was a good ligand for the synthesis of 1 under the conditions used and turnovers were increased by stepwise addition of appropriate amounts of acacH during the reaction (Table 4), probably due to the stabilization of the palladium intermediate by the coordination of acacH. Discussion In the oxidative coupling of DMP using palladium acetate as catalyst, oxygen pressure was an indispensable factor, otherwise metallic Pd precipi- tated during the reaction [4]. In this paper, we dealt with the reaction at atmospheric pressure in conjunction with Cu(II) salt. The isomer distribu- tions of the coupling products of DMP were dependent on the reaction temperature: the content of 1 increased as the temperature was elevated [4]. However, the reaction in the phen/Pd/Cu catalyst system yielded 2 selec- tively. We have already discussed that the steric effect predominant in this reaction was accounted for by the influence of the phen ligand. It is well established that biaryl is formed stereospecifically in the intramolecular reductive elimination from the diarylplatinum species, LPtR;. The formation of the C C linkage between two phenyl rings occurs exclusively at the carbon atoms bound directly to Pt atom [13,14]. On the other hand, the 64 reaction in the Pd/Cu/acacH catalyst system yielded mainly 1. In this case, more Cu(II) salt cocatalyst was required as compared to the phen/Pd/Cu catalyst system, in order to prevent precipitation of metallic Pd. It is likely that the 2,4-pentanedionato palladium complex is less stable than the 1,10-phenanthroline palladium complex at elevated temperature. Under the conditions used, the formation of 1 may be explained in terms of the co- ordination of DMP to the Pd atom prior to a hydrogen abstraction at the first stage. It is known that DMP acts as a bidentate neutral ligand, via the carbonyl group, towards various divalent cations [15]. Pd tends to abstract a hydrogen on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbon having a methoxy- carbonyl group in the DMP molecule (Scheme 1). ftKQAc)^ + 2 acacH - s ^ - 2 HOAc HC W CH \\ / \\ C=0 0- HgC +DMP ,/OMe -acacH COOMe COOMe Scheme 1. We have suggested that the hydrogen atom abstracted by Pd atom migrates to the chelated 2,4-pentanedionato ligand in Scheme 1. Now, we have carried out the coupling reaction of benzene-dg with Pd(acac)2, in which 2,4-pentanedione-di and biphenyl-dio were formed. We postulate that this reaction proceeds according to Scheme 2. In the phen/Pd/Cu catalyst system, k^ (Fig. 1) was independent of the Cu(II) salt concentration, and AE* (Fig. 2) was almost the same value as that of the phen/Pd catalyst system [3]. These results appear to indicate that copper salt does not participate in the intramolecular reductive elimination via the diarylpalladium species. However, Cu(II) salts play an important role in the catalytic cycle of the Pd species to elevate product yields and the life- time of the catalyst. It is noted that a small quantity of Cu(II) salt was 65 acac-FU-acac acac-Rj-acac ^6 -acacD C-0. ? < ^~^ H3C^ N30, C=<\\ DHC ,Pd /c=0 H3C Scheme 2 enough to perform the coupling reaction, differing from the Wacker process [10-12]. We postulate that LPd(O) is oxidized with molecular oxygen during the reaction and Cu(II) salt stabilizes the dioxygen adduct, LPdOz, which is thus activated. The 1:1 dioxygen-transition metal adducts are well known to exist as isolable complexes or transient species [16,17] and the activation of molecular oxygen by Cu(I) has been reported [18]. A plausible mechanism for the catalytic cycle is given in Scheme 3. LPd2\"*\" + 2RH > LPdR2 + 2H-*- (1) LPdR; ^ LPd(O) + R-R (2) LPd(O) + 62 + Cu(II) > [LPdOz- Cu(II)] (3) [ LPdO; Cu(II)] + 2RH > LPdRz + HOOH + Cu(II) (4) LPdR2 ^ LPd(O) + R-R (5) (HOOH formed is decomposed to water and oxygen under the conditions used.) Scheme 3 It is of interest that isomer distributions of the coupling products can be varied by using the appropriate catalyst system at atmospheric pressure. Acknowledgement We are indebted to Mr. M. Fujimoto for experimental assistance. References 1 R. van Helden and G. Verberg, Reel. Trav. Chim., 84 (1965) 1263. 2 M. Sainsburg, Tetrahedron, 36 (1980) 3327. 3 A. Shiotani, M. Yoshikiyo and H.

Dimethyl phthalate was dimerized catalytically in the presence of the 1,10-phenanthroline palladium complex and Cu(II) salt, to give exclusively 3,4,3',4'-tetramethyl biphenyltetracarboxylate (2). The presence of Cu(II) salt was required for the catalytic cycle at atmospheric pressure. Presumably, Cu(II) salt plays an important role for the stabilization of the palladium intermediate. On the other hand, the 2,3,3',4'-isomer (1) was mainly formed with the Pd(II)/Cu(II)/2,4-pentanedione system. The coupling reaction of benzene-d6 was carried out with bis(2,4-pentanedionato)palladium. The deuterium atom abstracted from benzene-d6 migrated to the chelated 2,4-pentanedionato ligand, giving 3-deuterated 2,4-pentanedione. References 1 R. van Helden G. Verberg Recl. Trav.
