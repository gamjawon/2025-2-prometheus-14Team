Santacesaria a'*, M. Di Serio a, R. Velotti b, U. Leone a a Dipartimento di Chimica dell'Universitii, Via Mezzocannone 4 (80134) Napoli, Italy CERIOSAusimontBussi (Pescara), Italy Received 9 March 1994; accepted 1 June 1994 Abstract Hydrogenation of anthraquinones at the oxygen is a key step in the industrial production of hydrogen peroxide. The reaction is very fast in the presence of palladium supported catalysts. However, these catalysts also promote the hydrogenation of the aromatic rings of the anthraquinone molecules giving place to substances not participating in the formation of hydrogen peroxide and causing a loss of active quinone. 2-ethylanthraquinone can also give tautomerization to oxanthrone and derivatives with a further loss of active quinone. The kinetics of the hydrogenation of the aromatic rings of 2-ethylanthraquinone are studied. A dual site reaction mechanism well explains the experimental findings. On the basis of this mechanism, kinetic expressions have been developed and the kinetic parameters determined. The contribution of tautomerization to the kinetic pattern has also been ascertained. Keywords: Anthraquinone derivatives; Aromatics; Hydrogenation; Palladium 1. Introduction In the industrial production of hydrogen peroxide via anthraquinone the hydrogenation at the oxygen is a key step of the process named all-TETRA and occurs according to the following reaction scheme [ 1-3 ] * Corresponding author. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

EAQ can easily be hydrogenated at the oxygen, as described by Santacesaria et al. [ 4 ] , but quickly exchanges hydrogen as a consequence of the following equilibrium reaction [ 5 ] EAQHZ + H4 -- H4Hz + EAQ strongly shifted to the right. Therefore, if the conversion is kept lower than 70% H4, only, is involved in the hydrogen peroxide production cycle. However, together with the useful hydrogenation at the oxygen which is a very fast reaction, a slow hydrogenation of the aromatic rings occurs [ 2 ] , as in the scheme: OH OH OH I 000 00 O (3) I H off off (EAQ H2) (H4H2) (H8H2) These reactions modify the optimal ratio EQA/H4 and determine the accumulation of the inactive quinone H8. Other secondary reactions occur as, for example, the EAQHZ tautomerization to oxanthrone followed by the formation of anthrone and dianthrone [ 2] . a, 0 0 +H2 Q Q Q Q I I Q ` - Q I I Q -- others H OH H H OH (4) Oxanthrone is not oxidized by oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide and leads to a loss of active quinone and to an accumulation in the working solution. Therefore, E. Santacesaria et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994) 37-46 39 it is important for a given catalyst to define activities and selectivities in the formation of the inactive by-products. In the present work the kinetics of hydrogenation of EAQ aromatic rings has been studied in the presence of a palladium supported catalyst. The results obtained for hydrogenation are in agreement with a dual site mechanism. The kinetic expressions for each reaction appearing in Eq. 3 have been derived from the reaction mechanism and tested by simulating experimental runs. The tautomerization contribution to the loss of EAQ has also been determined. A discussion on the kinetic parameters obtained and on the reaction mechanisms proposed concludes the paper. 2. Experimental 2.1. Apparatus, methods and reagents Kinetic runs were performed in a thermostatted stainless steel reactor of about 500 cm3, equipped with a Magnedrive stirrer, as that depicted in Fig. 1. The liquid volume was taken 300-350 cm3. Runs were performed in semibatch conditions by keeping the hydrogen pressure in the reactor constant. 100-110 g/1 of EAQ were dissolved in a solvent, and heated at the reaction temperature. Samples of the reaction mixture were withdrawn at different reaction times and analyzed by gas-chromatography. A capillary column i F A Fig. 1. Scheme of the slurry semibatch reactor.

EAQ, H4 and H8 were determined quantitatively, while other reaction products such as, oxanthrone, anthrone and dianthrone, produced in small quantities (as a whole less than 5-6%) , were not determined because of the lack of standards. However, a cumulative determination of these compounds have been made from mass balance. The characteristics of the palladium-supported catalyst employed are summarized in Table 1. Reagents were supplied by Ausimont SpA. 3. Results and discussion Kinetic runs of EAQ hydrogenation in the presence of palladium-supported catalyst were performed at different catalyst concentrations, hydrogen pressures and temperatures. g/L 120 100 H4 0 80 0 o 0 0 60 0 40 EAQ H8 20 - 0 0 O O O 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 time (h) Fig. 2.

Data reported in some runs are moderately scattered as a consequence of the difficulties in the gas chromatographic analysis of anthraquinones. The figures show the evolution with time of EAQ, H4 and H8, respectively. The operative conditions adopted are reported in the legend of the figures. As it can be seen, hydrogenation rates are strongly affected from all the variables considered, that is, catalyst concentration, hydrogen pressure and temperature. Then, it must be noted that H4 hydrogenation usually occurs only when EAQ has g/L 120 r- 100 H4 60 0 0 0 0 60 0 40 EAQ 20 I He I 0 12 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 time (h) Fig. 4.

Another observation is that the H8 formation rate strongly increases at the decrease of H4. These facts clearly indicate that both EAQ and H4 have a strong inhibitory effect on the formation of H8. Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics is not able to reproduce the described effects, neither the initial very small formation of H8 nor the exponential increase of this product observed in the runs reported in Figs. 2-5. In order to describe these types of behaviour, a dual site mechanism is more suitable. Kinetic runs have been interpreted by adopting the following reaction scheme: (r1) (r2) EAQ > H4 > H8 +2H2 +2H2 (r3) > others Therefore, to simulate the kinetic runs of Figs. 2-5 the following differential equations must be integrated numerically: dEAQ '= =ri -r3 dt dCHc _ _ dt r' r2 dCHg -r (g) dt dComer = (9) dt r3 E. Santacesaria et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994) 37-46 43 On the basis of the experimental observations we propose the following kinetic equations for respectively rl, r2 and r3: r - mk, b, CEAQPH2 (10) ' (1 + b, CEAQ + b2 CH4) 2 mk2 b2 CH4 pH2 r2 (1 + b, CEAQ + b2 CH4) 2 (1 1 ) r3 -mk3CEAQ (12) From Eqs. 10 and 11 it can be seen that both reaction rates depend as expected on catalyst concentration, hydrogen pressure and organic substrate concentration. EAQ disappears also as a consequence of tautomerization reactions. The small contribution of these reactions can be determined only from the mass balance, the kinetic analysis was, therefore, not detailed and we assumed a power law for the interpretation of the kinetic data. The kinetic expressions (10) and (11) can be derived from a dual site mechanism as the one reported in Fig. 6 where the hydrogenolysis reactions of the palladiumcarbon bonds are assumed as rate determining step. At this purpose we can write the following reaction steps: HPd + EAQ ;i~ PdEAQ (13 ) HPd + PdEAQ ;i~ Pd2 EAQ (14 ) Pd2 EAQ + HZ -- HZ PdZ EAQ (15 ) H2 Pd2 EAQ -- HPdEAQ + Pd slow (16 ) HPdEAQ #t H4 + Pd (17 ) HPd + H4 -- PdH4 (18 ) HPd + PdH4 -- Pd2 H4 (19 ) Pd2H4+H2 ~HZPd2H4 (20) HZ Pdz H4 -- HPdH4 + Pd slow (21) HPdH4 ;F--- H8 + Pd (22 ) 2Pd + HZ ;i~ 2HPd (23 ) By assuming that all the adsorbed species are present on the palladium surface in negligible amounts with the exclusion of: HPd, PdEAQ and PdH4 we can write that the overall concentration of sites is: O'T - 07HPd + O'PdEAQ + O'PdH4 (24) That is, by dividing all the terms by o-T we obtain: O E.

The remarkable effect of EAQ in preventing the formation of H8 has been further demonstrated by adding 30 g/1 of EAQ to an EAQ solution hydrogenated for about 35 h, at 3 atm and 70 C with 13 g/1 of catalyst concentration. The effect obtained E.

It can be seen that the formation of H8 is nearly stopped. Also this run has been simulated and the EAQ effect is well reproduced. To conclude, in this work, we have shown that palladium catalysts are able to hydrogenate the aromatic rings of anthraquinone molecules also at low temperature and pressure with a dual site mechanism. Reaction rates are strongly affected by catalyst concentration, hydrogen pressure and temperature and increase by increasing these variables. Degradation products obtained via tautomerization are formed only from EAQ, these compounds completely disappear giving place to products not well defined or not detectable by gas chromatography, as for example dianthrone. Tautomerization determines the loss of about 5% of EAQ and occurs during the hydrogenation of this compound. g/L 120 0 100 H O g 80 O __ 60 H8 40 EAO o 20 8 % % 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 time (h) Fig. 7.
