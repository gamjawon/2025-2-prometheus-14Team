MARGITFALVI, MIHALY HEGEDUS and EMILIA TALAS Central Research Institute for Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, 1525 Budapest P.O.B. 17 (Hungary) Summary Reaction of methylcyclopentane has been studied on different Sn-Pt/ A1203 catalysts at 520 C. Catalysts were prepared by using controlled sur- face reactions creating either tin-platinum or tin-alumina interactions exclusively. Based on the analysis of the yield-conversion dependences it was established that in addition to the consecutive routes for the formation of methylcyclopentadiene and benzene, direct routes should also exist. Formation of benzene can be strongly hindered by simultaneous introduc- tion of metallic tin into platinum and ionic tin into alumina. Introduction Reactions of alkylcyclopentanes (ACPs) play an important role in naphtha reforming. These reactions have been widely studied on different types of supported and unsupported platinum-containing catalysts [1-3]. ACPs undergo ring opening, hydrogenolysis to light hydrocarbons, dehydro- genation and ring expansion to aromatics. In the conversion of alkylcyclo- pentanes on supported metals, both metallic and acidic sites of the catalyst can be involved. In this context it should be mentioned that on Pt/Al203 catalysts, especially at high temperatures, the formation of aromatic hydro- carbons from ACPs is attributed to the bifunctional reaction route [4]. The classical bifunctional reaction route [5] for conversion of Cg hydrocarbons is given in Scheme 1, although more complex schemes are also known [6]. Recently we have shown that by using different types of Controlled Surface Reactions (CSRs) it is possible either to introduce the second metal into the first, with formation of alloy type bimetallic surface entities, or to stabilize the second metal in its ionic form on the support [7, 8]. In this way both the metallic and the acidic functions of a given supported metal catalyst can be modified. This approach has been used to prepare different types of Sn Pt/Al203 catalysts with the exclusive formation of Pt Sn and Sn alumina interactions [7, 8]. We have also demonstrated that preparation 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 280 E ^ ^ c\"s= [\"'- ^ - I- ; ^ c7 gi -(s): -i i i i ! O !O=Q -(&i| metal catalysed reactions Scheme 1. of catalysts by CSRs can be used as a powerful tool to study the mechanism of hydrocarbon reactions catalysed by bifunctional catalysts [9]. In this case, reactions catalysed by metals can be strongly influenced by creation of bi- metallic surface entities, while acid-catalysed reactions can be affected by suppression of the acidity of the support by ionic forms of the second metal [8,9]. In this work, as an extension of our earlier studies on n-hexane conver- sion [7-9], we report preliminary data on the reactions of methylcyclopen- tane (MCP) carried out on different types of Sn Pt/A^Os catalysts. The aim of this work is to elucidate how the selective blocking of either the metallic or the acidic sites of a Pt/A^O^ catalyst by different forms of tin will in- fluence the routes of formation of benzene and unsaturated derivatives of MCP. Experimental The base Pt/Al^O^ catalyst with 0.5 wt.% Pt was prepared by impregna- tion of Ketjen CK-300 type alumina (particle size: 0.35 - 0.63 mm) with H^PtClg in hydrochloric acid solution, followed by drying at 100 C for 2 h and reducing at 400 C for 3 h with H2. Three different types of tin- platinum catalysts were prepared from the base Pt/Al^O^ catalyst. Details on the preparation of Sn Pt/A^O^ catalysts can be found elsewhere [8, 9]. Suggested surface species are shown in Scheme 2. The designation of catalysts prepared is as follows: Catalysts Type A with tin-platinum inter- actions; Catalysts Type B with tin-alumina interaction; Catalysts Type C with both types of interactions. In order to maintain the form of the primary surface entities, Pt/A^O^ and Sn Pt/Al^O^ catalysts prepared in this study were used without calcination. Characteristic features of the catalysts are given in Table 1. The reaction of methylcyclopentane (MCP) was carried out in a periodically operated continuous flow microreactor in the presence of hydrogen at 520 C and 1 bar pressure.

All catalysts used in this study were re-reduced prior to the reaction at 550 C for 1.5 h. The partial pressure of MCP was 1.33 kPa. The reaction was carried out at different contact times by varying either the amount of catalysts or the flow rate of the reactant. The main reaction products were: methylcyclopentenes (MCP~), methyl- cyclopentadienes (MCP\"^), and benzene. Under our experimental condi- tions the selectivity of formation of the above-mentioned products was nearly 90%. The selectivity towards the formation of ring-opening products (2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane and hexane) was less than 5%. For this reason, this communication will focus on the formation of MCP~, MOP\"121 and benzene. Results and discussion On all catalysts, the conversion us. contact time type dependences are linear. Benzene yields us. contact time dependences have strong S-like character. This fact indicates that in the formation of benzene, especially on bifunctional catalysts, even at relatively low conversion values (below 10%), mainly consecutive reactions are involved. 282 Initial rates of MCP conversion and rates of benzene formation measured at 0, 5 and 10% of conversion are given in Table 1. Introduction of tin in different forms resulted in a considerable decrease in the rates of MCP conversion and significant changes in the product selectivities. On all catalysts, except type C, the rate of benzene formation strongly depended on the conversion (or on the contact time) as can be seen from data given in Table 1. Measurable initial rates and initial selectivity values of the benzene formation indicate that a direct route for the formation of benzene should exist; however, the contribution of this route to the total conversion of MCP is not high. The contribution of this direct route strongly depended on the type of catalyst used. The highest initial benzene selectivity value was obtained on type B catalyst. From these results, it is suggested that metallic sites should be involved in the direct route for benzene formation. In order to obtain additional information about the role of primary and secondary reactions in the formation and/or comsumption of MCP13, MCP33^ and benzene, the conversion us. yield dependences were obtained as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Analysis of these dependencies can be found else- where [11]. Initial product selectivities obtained from these dependences (i.e. by measuring the slope of the dependences at zero conversion) were in good agreement with the values calculated from initial rates (see Table 1). On catalyst types A and B, the yield of benzene formation was slightly less than on the base Pt/Al203 catalysts (see Fig. l(a) and l(b)). The yield us. conversion dependence for the benzene formation indicates that both types of active sites are involved in the consecutive routes for benzene formation. It also means that on Pt/Al203 and type A catalyst, acidic sites of the alumina are involved, while on type B catalyst the metallic function is involved in the ring enlargement reaction. However, simultaneous blocking of both types of active sites in catalyst type C resulted in very pronounced suppression of the formation of benzene. On catalyst type C, only two main reaction products were obtained: methylcyclopentenes and methylcyclo- pentadienes. On this catalyst, both metal- and acid-catalysed ring enlarge- ment reactions were strongly hindered. The strong suppression of benzene \" % Conv. Pig. 1.

The conversion us. yield dependences of the dehydrogenation products (MCP= and MCP^3) obtained on the PtIAl-fiy and type C catalyst are shown in Fig. 2. Both MCP\" and MCP\"'\" are unstable products on the Pt/Al;;03 catalyst. However, the character of these dependences is completely dif- ferent on type C catalyst. On type C catalyst, the form of the MCP\" depen- dence indicates that the contribution of its consumption to the overall product balance is smaller than that of the base Pt/A^Oa catalyst. The dif- ference between these two catalysts is even more significant with respect to the formation of MCP^\". On type C catalyst, MCP\"'\" is considered as a stable primary and stable secondary product. This means that at low conver- sion, MCP^\" can form directly from MCP without the appearance of its precursor in the gas phase. It was the only catalyst on which, upon increasing the conversion, the yield of MCP= = increased due to the dehydrogenation of MCP\" and the suppression of reactions responsible for the consumption of MCP\"'\". The yield us. conversion dependence for the formation MCP='= on catalyst types A and B had the same character as the formation of MCP\" on catalyst type C. This fact indicates that on these catalysts MCP= = can be an unstable, but primary, product. On these catalysts, due to partial blocking, either the metallic or the acidic sites of the catalyst secondary reactions responsible for the consumption of MCP= = are hindered. The results discussed above indicate that additional reactions should be included in Scheme 1. These reactions are as follows: direct routes for the formation of methylcyclopentadiene and ben- zene from MCP catalyzed by platinum; consecutive route for benzene formation via MCP=, MCP\"'\"; metal-catalysed ring enlargement of MCP^\" into benzene. Conclusions Upon applying different types of CSRs to introduce tin onto a Pt/A^O^ catalyst, its active sites (metallic and acidic) can be selectively 284 blocked by different forms of tin. By using different types of Sn Pt/AlzOa catalysts, it was evidenced that at 520 C and above 5% conversion both types of active sites (metallic and acidic) can be involved in the ring enlarge- ment reactions leading to the formation of benzene from MCP. Suppression of the benzene formation from methylcyclopentane requires simultaneous blocking of both types of active sites. Kinetic evidence was obtained that multiply-dehydrogenated reaction products, such as methylcyclopentadiene and benzene, can be formed directly from methylcyclopentane without desorption of their intermediates. It was suggested that a direct route for the formation of MCP^3 and benzene should exist. However, further exper- iments carried out at low conversion will be required to elucidate the role and pecularities of the above-suggested direct routes. Metal-catalysed ring enlargement should be a structure-sensitive reaction. Acknowledgement This research was financially supported by Research Contract OTKA 1003. References 1 F. G. Gault, Adv.
