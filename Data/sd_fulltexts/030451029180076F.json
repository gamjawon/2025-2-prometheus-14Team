(Received November 5, 1990; accepted February 15, 1991) Abstract The effect of several organic acids and bases used as solvents and additives for the enantioselective hydrogenation of a-ketoesters with cinchona-modified platinum catalysts is described. Carboxylic acids have a positive influence on the enantioselectivity of the reaction, both as solvents and as additives. The best results are observed in acetic acid where the optical yields increase between 8 and 1296 compared to toluene or ethanol as solvents. In addition, extremely low modifier concentrations are necessary. For the hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate, using a special wide pore Pt/A1203 catalyst and 10,11dihydro-O-methylcinchonidine as modifier, we obtained 9596 enantaoselectivity, the highest value ever reported for any chiral heterogeneous catalyst. Bases are not suitable as solvents but in some cases they have a beneficial effect as additives at low concentration. Introduction Platinum catalysts modified by cinchona alkaloids catalyze the enantioselective hydrogenation of a-ketoesters to the corresponding a-hydroxyesters with quite high optical yields [ 1-5 ]. The influence of the solvent type has been investigated for the enantioselective hydrogenation of ethyl benzoylformate and methyl pyruvate with PVC [ 1, 2 ] and Pt/A1203 catalysts [ 3, 61. o s% Pt/A1203 H O-H RjO\"\"Et + H2 R, H R~>4O~Et O O H N .,.

In a few cases it was demonstrated that addition of triethylamine to the reaction mixture has an effect (usually positive, but in a few cases negative) on the enantioselectivity of the reaction [2, 3[. In the course of a catalyst screening, several catalysts were tested for the hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate in different solvents. Surprisingly, the best results were obtained in acetic acid! This finding was unexpected because the cinchona alkaloids used for modification are strong bases prone to protonation by acids, thus preventing their interaction with the substrate and the platinum surface. We therefore decided to investigate the effect of acidic and basic solvents and additives on several substrate-modifier-catalyst combinations in more detail. Experimental Materials Catalysts 1-4 are commercial 5ss'u Pt/A1203 and 5% Pt/graphite catalysts from Heraeus. 5 R 94 is a commercial 5ss'o Pt/A1203 type from Johnson Matthey Inc. (dispersion 0.22) [7j. Before use, all catalysts were pre-treated for 2 h in hydrogen at 400 C [2, 5]. Ethyl pyruvate and ethyl 4-phenyl-2-oxobutyrate were distilled before use. Cinchonidine (F7uka, purum) was used as received, 10,11-dihydrocinchonidine was obtained by hydrogenation of cinchonidine (5% Pd/C in 1 N HZS04, RT, 1 bar) which was methylated (CH31, NaH in THF) to give 10,11dihydro-O-methylcinchonidine. Solvents (Fluka; pururn and puriss.) were used as received. Hydrogtion experiments The thermostatted 50 ml autoclave was equipped with baffles, thermocouple and magnetic stirrer. A reservoir and pressure regulator allowed experiments to be carried out under isobaric conditions. In a standard experiment, 50 mg 5ss'o Pt/A1203 catalyst, 20 ml solvent, 5 ml freshly distilled substrate (45 mmol ethyl pyruvate and 26 mmol ethyl 4-phenyl-2-oxobutyrate, respectively) and 10 mg modifier were introduced into the 50 ml autoclave. The reaction was stopped after 30 min, the initial rates of hydrogenation were calculated from the pressure drop recorded from the reservoir (rflb., = =dH2/dt) and evaluated from data collected in the first 1-5 min. The catalyst screening was carried out in a 250 ml autoclave at 20 C and 70 bar using 10 g ethyl pyruvate in 20 ml solvent, 200 mg of catalyst and 40 mg of cinchonidine [$J. Conversions were determined by the pressure drop in the reservoir and by GLC. The e.e.s were determined by GLC after derivatization with isopropyl isocyanate (Chirasil-L-Val; 140 C) [5[. 217 Results and discussion Screening results Four different catalysts were investigated in several solvents for the hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate, using cinchonidine as modifier. As illustrated in Table 1, the effect of the solvent polarity is different for the different catalysts tested. Acetic acid, which was used with catalysts 3 and 4, leads to very high optical yields. Comparison of various acidic and basic solvents with toluene and ethanol In order to demonstrate the effect of acidic and basic solvents on the enantioselective hydrogenation of a-ketoesters more systematically, we chose substrate---modifier combinations and a special wide pore Pt/A1203 catalyst forwhich we had already obtained very good optical yields in more conventional solvents [5, 7]. These results are summarized in Table 2. Compared to the enantioselectivities obtained in ethanol or toluene, the use of acetic acid leads to a remarkable increase in optical yields of 8 to 12%. The hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate with 10,11-dihydro-O-methylcinchonidine (MeOHCd) as modifier has been reproduced with e.e.s between 93 and 95%. These are the highest values ever reported for an enantioselective heterogeneous catalyst and they are close to the enantioselectivity obtained with very good homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts [9]. In some cases the observed activity was also higher in acetic acid than in ethanol or toluene. Because the modifier concentration can affect the optical yield [5, 10], a few experiments were carried out with different amounts of MeOHCd added to the acetic acid solution. Even with very low modifier concentrations, the enantioselectivities and rates are comparable to those obtained under standard conditions (10 mg MeOHCd). These preliminary results suggest that there is a similar influence of the modifier concentration on rate and e.e. as observed in toluene and ethanol and, therefore, the same ligand-accelerated reaction mechanism might be operative [10]. In order to see whether the high enantioselectivity observed for acetic acid is unique, various other carboxylic acids were tested as solvents. With the exception of formic, pivalic and trifluoroacetic acid (where no reaction TABLE 1 Hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate.

The basic solvents investigated lead to very slow reactions and, with the exception of quinoline and acetonitrile, also to almost racemic product. Primary amines such as butylamine and ethylenediamine cannot be used as solvents because they react with ethyl pyruvate. Solvent effects for the enantioselective hydrogenation of a-ketoesters using cinchona-modified platinum catalyst have been reviewed [ 111. Generally, the highest enantioselectivities have been obtained in aprotic solvents with a dielectric constant between 4 and 8, but the sensitivity of the correlation was highly dependent on the type of substrate and catalyst. The results 219 reported above and depicted in Figs. 1(a) and (b) confirm these findings, but it is also clear that there are exceptions (e.g. catalyst 2 in Fig. 1(a)) and that the DE is not a sufficient parameter to describe all the observed effects. We tried to correlate our results to some other solvent parameters (p., ET, DN or AN) but without success. At the moment all we can say is that carboxylic acid solvents (but not phenol) lead to better enantioselectivities than expected for their polarity, while basic solvents are not suitable. The results observed with acetonitrile suggest that it might be the presence of a free electron pair and not the basicity of the solvent which is responsible for the low enantioselectivity.

These screening experiments were carried out with ethyl pyruvate using the same Pt/A1203 catalyst. The results (see Table 3) generally confirm the positive influence of carboxylic acids. Interestingly, phenol enhances, the reaction rate but lowers the e.e. The effect of the addition of bases to these systems is less pronounced than for some of the cases described by Orito et al., in which e.e. changes of up to + 13 and -35O were observed when NEt3 was added to the reaction mixture [2, 3 1. For selected additives with a positive effect on the enantioselectivity the influence of their concentration on e.e. and rate was investigated in more detail. The results are depicted in Figs. 2 and 3. Somewhat surprisingly, at low concentration the addition of acetic and formic acid as well as of quinoline leads to a reproducible increase in e.e. The effect on the catalyst activity is less uniform but generally, with the exception of formic acid, these additives enhance the reaction rate as well The results obtained upon addition of acidic modifiers agree well with the solvent effects described above. For reasons we do not understand at the moment, the presence of moderate amounts of acid has in most cases a beneficial effect on the e.e. and the rate of the hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate. The size of the effect and the amount of acid necessary to observe it vary with the type of acid. It seems that strong acids can be used only TABLE 3 Effect of various acidic and basic additives on the hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate; solvent toluene, conditions see Table 2 Additive Amount Modifier e.e.

Conditions see Table 2. at low concentration. The fact that formic acid decreases the reaction rate could be explained by its decomposition to CO, which is known to deactivate hydrogenation catalysts. There is an interesting parallel to the Ni/tartrate system, in which the addition of acetic acid has been reported to enhance the enantioselectivity for the hydrogenation of ss-ketoesters while the addition of pivalic acid is beneficial for methyl alkyl ketones [ 12 ]. Bases have a small but reproducible positive effect on the reaction as long as they are added in low concentration. Quinoline is an interesting additive because the quinoline part of the cinchona molecule is thought to be responsible for the interaction with the platinum surface [ 6 ]. At high concentrations, competition between adsorbed cinchona modifier and quinoline could explain the observed decrease in both rate and enantioselectivity. The rate enhancement obtained with very low amounts of the base (see Fig. 3a) might be due to the same some sort of base effect that we have observed 222 for the hydrogenation of a-ketoesters with an unmodified Pt/alumina catalyst [5]. Conclusions The enantioselective hydrogenation of a-ketoesters by platinum catalysts is strongly affected by the nature of the solvent and also by the presence of several additives. Generally, the best optical yields are obtained using solvents with a dielectric constant between 2 and 10, but exceptions have been observed. Acidic solvents give higher e.e.s than expected for their DE, while basic solvents lead to very low e.e.s. The use of acetic acid as a solvent results in the highest optical yields ever observed for a heterogeneous hydrogenation catalyst. In many cases, the rate of the reaction is increased as well. The effect of acidic and basic additives to toluene reaction mixtures roughly reflects their influence as solvents. At the present time we cannot explain these empirical findings.
