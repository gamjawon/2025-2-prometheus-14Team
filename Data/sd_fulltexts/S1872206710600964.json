Co-Mo/CMC and Ni-Mo/CMC catalysts were prepared by impregnation in the presence of a chelating agent and they exhibited much better porous properties than their AC supported counterparts. Accordingly, the CMC supported Co-Mo and Ni-Mo catalysts showed higher activities than the AC supported catalysts for the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of organic sul- fides. More importantly, Co-Mo/CMC was much more active than commercial Co-Mo/γ-Al 2 O 3 for the HDS of thiophene in a model gasoline. Ni-Mo/CMC was significantly more active than commercial FH-98 for the HDS of dibenzothiophene in a model diesel. Key words: mesoporous carbon; porous property; hydrodesulfurization; cobalt; molybdenum; nickel; thiophene; dibenzothiophene dibenzothiophene Alumina is a frequently used support for hydrodesulfuriza- tion (HDS) catalysts [1,2]. It has been established that two types of Co-Mo-S HDS active sites might exist on alumina. Type I consists of the Mo species that strongly interacts with alumina and it is not completely converted to the sulfides and hence is not active. In contrast, type II is the Co-Mo-S species that does not strongly interact with alumina and, therefore, it is the active species in HDS [3,4]. By comparison to alumina, carbon supports have weaker interactions with molybdenum and supported Co-Mo-S catalysts, therefore, have higher HDS activities [2]. However, traditional activated carbons (AC) have small pores that are easily blocked by the supported spe- cies. In contrast, mesoporous carbons have larger pores and have been used as catalyst supports [5]. Recently, we devel- oped a cost-effective method for the preparation of mesoporous carbons and designated them CMC [6]. These carbon materials possess high surface areas (1 400–2 000 m 2 /g), large pore volumes (1.44–2.72 cm 3 /g) and 100% mesopores with average diameters of 3–7 nm. In this work, two CMCs were used to support Co-Mo-S and Ni-Mo-S for HDS reactions. In HDS catalysts, Mo and W are active metals while Co and Ni are promoters. Co and Ni undergo sulfidation faster than the active metals and form stable sulfides with low HDS ac- tivities. When a chelating agent is used, the sulfidation of promoters is retarded and the active metals undergo sulfida- tion first leading to catalysts with higher HDS activities [7–10]. In this work, Co-Mo/CMC and Ni-Mo/CMC were prepared by impregnation with a chelating agent. The Co-Mo/CMC was tested for the HDS of a model gasoline containing thiophene and compared with a commercial Co-Mo/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst (DSO catalyst) [11]. The Ni-Mo/ CMC was examined for the HDS of a model diesel containing dibenzothiophene (DBT) and compared with a commercial FH-98 catalyst. Two different CMCs were used in this work. The textural properties of the supports are shown in Table 1. During the preparation of the HDS catalysts, we used different chelating agents, which included citric acid, ethylenediamine, ethyl- enediamine tetraacetic acid, and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA). NTA was found to be a good chelating agent for the preparation of Co-Mo and Ni-Mo supported on a CMC [12]. The catalyst Co-Mo/CMC was prepared by the incipient wetness impreg- nation method. NTA was dissolved in a 25% ammonia solu- tion, followed by addition of the required amount of cobalt nitrate (NTA/Co molar ratio = 1.2). After the complete disso- lution of cobalt nitrate, the required amount of ammonium SHI Guojun et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 961–964 heptamolybdate (AHM) was added (Co/(Co + Mo) atomic ratio = 0.25). The resulting solution was used to impregnate the dry CMC support. The other catalysts studied in this work were prepared in a similar way. The catalysts underwent direct sul- fidation at 673 K for 3 h and they were investigated for the HDS reaction under the conditions reported elsewhere [11–14]. Table 1 shows the textural properties of the supports and supported catalysts. The data in Table 1 shows that the pore volumes of the CMC supports were much higher than that of AC. Accordingly, the pore volumes remain high for the CMC supported catalysts while that of AC almost disappeared. Ap- parently, the textural properties of the CMCs were much bet- ter than those of AC for the supported HDS catalysts. Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of CMC-1 and Co-Mo/ CMC-1 before and after sulfidation. The XRD patterns only show signals from the Co-Mo/CMC-1 catalyst supports before and after sulfidation indicating a high dispersion of supported Co-Mo species on CMC-1. Figure 2 compares Co-Mo/CMC-1 with Co-Mo/AC and commercial Co-Mo/γ-Al 2 O 3 for the HDS of thiophene in a model gasoline. Apparently, Co-Mo/CMC-1 is much more active than Co-Mo/AC and Co-Mo/γ-Al 2 O 3 . More impor- tantly, the conversion of thiophene on Co-Mo/CMC-1 at 493 K was higher than that on Co-Mo/γ-Al 2 O 3 at 553 K, indicating that Co-Mo/CMC-1 works at a temperature 60 K lower than Co-Mo/γ-Al 2 O 3 . At 493 K, more than 95% thiophene was converted on Co-Mo/CMC-1, while the decrease in thiophene was less than 5% on the CMC-1 support under the same con- ditions (not shown). Therefore the continuous removal of thiophene by its adsorption on the support only is unlikely. Diesel fuels may contain sulfur in the form of DBT or 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT), and these are much more difficult to remove than thiophene. In addition, diesel fuels contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) that should be hydrogenated to increase the cetane number and to decrease the emission of particular materials [15]. Therefore, supports with large pores are desired to hydrotreat the above-mentioned organic sulfurs and large molecular weight PAHs in diesel streams (which also contain hydrocar- Table 1 Textural properties of the supports and supported catalysts Sample* BET surface area (m 2 /g) Pore volume (ml/g) Pore size (nm) AC 936 0.34 3.8 CMC-1 1837 2.05 3.9 CMC-2 1480 2.45 6.3 Co-Mo/AC 537 0.08 3.2 Co-Mo/CMC-1 1049 1.05 3.7 Ni-Mo/CMC-2 608 0.82 5.5 *The nominal loading is 0.04 metal atoms per carbon atom with an atomic ratio of 0.25 for Co/(Co+Mo) and Ni/(Ni+Mo). 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Co-Mo/CMC-1 after sulfidation Co-Mo/CMC-1 before sulfidation 2θ/( o ) CMC-1 In te n s ity Fig. 1.

In this work, a mesoporous carbon (CMC-2, see Table 1) with a larger average pore diameter was used to sup- port Ni-Mo. Figure 3 shows that Ni-Mo/CMC-2 was significantly more active than the commercial catalyst FH-98 for the HDS of DBT. For example, while the conversion of DBT was about 97.8% over FH-98 at 593 K, it was almost 100% over Ni-Mo/ CMC-2 at the same temperature. In addition, the conversion of DBT was 98.8% over Ni-Mo/CMC-2 at 553 K, which is higher than the 92.4% over FH-98 at 593 K indicating that Ni-Mo/CMC-2 works at a temperature 40 K lower than FH-98. In conclusion, CMC were used to support Co-Mo-S and Ni-Mo-S for HDS reactions. Co-Mo-S/CMC and Ni-Mo-S/ CMC were found to be highly active for the HDS of thiophene and DBT in model gasoline and diesel fuels, respectively. References 1 Breysse M, Portefaix J L, Vrinat M.
