Donato Milanese, Milan (Italy) ANGELINA ALTOMARE and FRANCESCO CIARDELLI Dipartimento di Chimica e Chimica Industrials, Universita' di Pisa, Pisa (Italy) Summary Hafnium polymerization catalysts supported on spray-dried magnesium chloride have been prepared by precipitation with alkylaluminium chlorides from paraffin solutions of hafnium(tetra-n-butanolate). These catalysts have been used for ethylene polymerization after activation with different alu- minium alkyi derivatives such as tri(isobutyl) aluminium, triethylaluminium and diethylaluminium chloride. The influence of the polymerization condi- tions, i.e. hydrogen pressure, 1-butene content, temperature, cocatalyst and ethyl benzoate, on the specific activity, polymerization rate and molecular weight has been investigated. The behaviour of the Hf catalyst has been compared to that of similar systems based on titanium or zirconium. The results obtained suggest that the selection of appropriate transition metal derivatives provides the further possibility of tailoring the characteristics of polyethylene. Introduction Novel catalysts based on titanium and hafnium derivatives co-supported on magnesium chloride have a substantial industrial interest, in particular with regard to the preparation of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) [1]. The main concern in such systems is the role of different metal species and the occurrence of possible synergistic effects. In a previous paper [2], an attempt was made to understand the role of hafnium on the basis of the behaviour of various Ti/Hf catalysts compared with similar catalysts where titanium was the sole transition metal present. The catalyst performance, as measured by the specific activity (SA) and the characteristics of the polymer as expressed by its average molecular weight (M^), melt flow index (MFI) and shear sensitivity (SS) were related to the content of hafnium and of Lewis base [ethyl benzoate (EB)] added to the system. In particular, it was shown that while the presence of hafnium reduces the specific activity, the resulting polymer is characterized by a wider molecular weight distribution with 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 144 respect to that obtained in the presence of the titanium-based catalyst. This last result was associated with the capability of Hf-containing sites to produce high molecular weight polymer under hydrogen atmosphere condi- tions. Furthermore, the higher sensitivity of the Hf-containing sites to the addition of EB offered an additional means of modulating the characteristics of the polymer obtained [2, 3]. In order to further investigate the hypotheses put forward to explain the above results, MgClg-supported hafnium catalysts have been prepared using the same procedure [4] and their behaviour tested by studying the polymer- ization of ethylene both in the presence and absence of Lewis bases, hydrogen and 1-butene. The results obtained have been compared to those for polymer- izations carried out under similar conditions in the presence of titanium and zirconium catalysts also supported on MgClg and prepared using the same procedure. Interesting observations have also been derived from catalysts with a definite structure, either in a soluble [2, 5] or insoluble [2] form. The latter catalysts have been employed in the present work, since the literature data on ethylene polymerization in the presence of hafnium catalysts are not sufficiently precise. Indeed, the only information available to date concerns systems such as tetra-allyl-hafnium [6], CpaHf( 115)2 [7] or CpzHfXz with alumoxane [8, 9], and hafnium hydrides supported on silica [10]. The results obtained relating to specific activity and polymer molecu- lar weight are discussed in the present paper with the aim of characterizing hafnium as a polymerization catalyst, particularly with reference to those factors which influence the lifetime of the growing chain and the polymer yield. In addition, the nature and homogeneity of the active catalyst sites has been investigated from the basis of data concerning ethylene co- polymerization with 1-butene and the effect of ethyl benzoate on catalyst performance. Experimental Preparation of magnesium-supported hafnium (142R and 142RR) [4], titanium (146) [4, 11] and zirconium (155) [4] catalysts Titanium- and zirconium-(tetra-n-butanolate) were commercial products (Dynamit) having a high chemical purity (99.5%); hafnium (tetra-n- butanolate) was prepared from HfC^ (Pechiney, 99.3% purity) according to literature methods [12]. The various metal tetrabutoxides were solubilized in anhydrous paraffin, and then magnesium chloride (spray-dried by means of a laboratory apparatus) was added and the resulting slurry heated at 80 C for 4 h. On cooling to room temperature, a paraffin solution of an aluminium alkylchlo- ride was then added dropwise and the mixtures heated at 80 C for 2 h. The resulting solid was washed with anhydrous paraffin and dried in vacuo. The catalysts used in this work had a magnesium/transition metal mole ratio of ca 1.0 in all cases. 145 Ethylene polymerization Polymerization experiments with ethylene were performed as described for the following example where catalyst 142R was employed (run BL29, Table 1). Anhydrous n-hexane (1820ml), 1.2gAlBu^ and 117 mg of catalyst 142R were added with stirring to a 5 1 reactor, the temperature of the latter raised to 85 C and hydrogen gas at a pressure of 3.7 bar passed through the stirred solution. 1-Butene (3 g) and ethylene were then added successively up to a total pressure of 12 bar which was then maintained constant over a reaction time of 4 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 ml of a solution of 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol (10% w/w) in ethanol. The resulting polymer was separated by filtration and dried. Intrinsic viscosity measurements Determinations were carried out in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) at 135 C using a polymer concentration of 0.01-0.05 g in 100ml TCB and employing an Ubbeholde viscometer. Average molecular weights were calcu- lated according to the equation [vj\\^s, = 4.06 x lO^M,)0-725 as reported in the literature [13]. Results and discussion Ca(aZys(s All transition metal catalysts used in this work were prepared in the Research Laboratories of Enichem Anic. Transition metal derivatives of titanium, zirconium and hafnium were supported on spray-dried magnesium dichloride by precipitation from paraffin solution of the respective tetra-ra-butanolate in the form of chloro-alkoxy derivatives obtained by chlorination with aluminum alkyi chlorides. Prepara- tion details and analyses for the zirconium, hafnium and titanium catalyst are reported in [4] and [11]. Hafnium(tetra-ra-butanolate) was prepared from hafnium tetrachloride (Pechiney) containing 99.3% HfCL^ and 0.7% zirco- nium tetrachloride. As a result of the preparation method the catalysts contained, in addition to the respective transition metal, magnesium, aluminium, chlorine, alkoxy and alkyi groups. The relative ratios of these components are similar in the different systems used [2,4,11] with a magnesium/transition metal molar ratio of about 1 in all samples. Effect of different parameters on ethylene polymerization The influence of different parameters such as the hydrogen/ethylene ratio, the 1-butene content in the polymerization mixture, the tri(iso- butyl) aluminium (TIBA)/hafnium molar ratio, polymerization temperature, type of cocatalyst and the amount of Lewis base (ethyl benzoate) on the 146 behaviour of the hafnium-supported catalyst (142R or 142RR) has been evaluated by measuring the specific activity [SA: expressed as kg poly- ethylene (g at. transition metal)\"1 (duration)\"1 (ethylene pressure)-1], the overall intrinsic viscosity and the corresponding average molecular weight (K?y) of the polymer. An increase in hydrogen pressure from 0 to ca. 8 bar was accompanied by a substantial decrease in the intrinsic viscosity, with the corresponding average viscometric molecular weight dropping from 2.78 x 106 to 0.33 x 106 (Table 1). This result is well in keeping with known methods of controlling the chain length by hydrogenolysis described for several Ziegler-Natta cata- lysts based on titanium [14 -16]. The variation in the C2H4 partial pressure had no dramatic influence on hydrogenolysis, as demonstrated by the monotonic decrease of My obtained in runs BL132 to BL28. A more accurate evaluation is obtained in runs BL132 and BL19, carried out at the same partial pressure of C2H4, where the value of My fell by two-thirds in going from a hydrogen partial pressure of 0 to 5.5 bar. The observed decrease in specific activity in these latter two runs undertaken at a constant C^H^ partial pressure (SA reduced to one-half when H2/C2H4 ratio changed from 0 to 1.15) is also in keeping with previous observations regarding titanium catalysts [14]. Hence, in the case of polymer chains growing on hafnium carbon bonds, hydrogen also affects the chain length and activity probably via the same mechanism as originally proposed for titanium. This assumes the generation of metal hydrides by hydrogenoly- sis of the transition metal carbon bond (Scheme 1, step a) followed by re-activation via olefin addition (Scheme 1, step b).

''AS determined by gas chromatographic analysis. 147 Addition of variable amounts of 1-butene to the reaction mixture was accompanied by a substantial decrease in the specific activity accompanied by a very modest reduction in My (Table 2). This decrease in activity can be correlated with the much lower polymerization rate of 1-butene with respect to ethylene in insertion polymerization [17]. An increase in the tri(iso- butyl) aluminium (TIBA)/Hf molar ratio from 16 to 128 has a marked effect on SA, which as a result is reduced to one-quarter of its initial value, whereas the effect, on the molecular weight is quite modest with a decrease of only ca. 20% (runs BL122 and BL124 in Table 3). It is of interest to note that a higher concentration of Hf leads to a better yield but a lower molecular weight (BL118) (Table 3). These data suggest that the tendency of active sites to favour the transfer reaction with TIBA (Scheme 2) is very low.

However, the effect seems to be substantially larger for hafnium than for titanium catalysts. The Hf-based catalytic system studied in this work is appreciably sensitive to temperature; in particular, in the absence of hydrogen increasing the temperature from 65 C (run BL130) to 90 C (run BL131) led to a 40% reduction in SA and ca. 30% reduction in My for the resulting polymer. These effects are enhanced by the presence of Hg (runs BL125, 126, 127 and 129) where both the SA and My values are lower than in runs carried out in the absence of Hg at the corresponding temperatures. The combination of increas- ing temperature and presence of hydrogen allows a substantial reduction of M, to be obtained without too large a decrease in SA (cf. runs BL129 and BL130) (Table 4). Replacement of TIBA with triethylaluminium (TEA) or diethylalu- minium chloride (DEAC) indicates that SA increases in the order DEAC < TEA < TIBA, with My increasing in the same order at the same time. The extremely low activity of the system when DEAC is used as a cocatalyst is quite remarkable. The results obtained in the presence of TIBA/DEAC mixtures (runs BL90 and BL88) suggest that DEAC is not capable of activat- ing Hf-containing sites; indeed, in run BL90, the same activity was observed when TIBA was present in the system in a 5:1 ratio with respect to Hf and a 1:5 ratio with respect to DEAC (Table 5) as in the absence of DEAC (run BL85 carried out with TIBA alone). The addition of ethyl benzoate (EB) also depresses both SA and i0v, but the effect on SA is quite substantial. Indeed an increase in the EB/Hf ratio from 0 to 1.0 leads to a drop in SA from 47 to 11 kg mol\"1 h~1 bar\"1 while My only diminishes from 1.70 x 106 to 1.35 x 106 (Table 6).

In this context, EB must be considered as acting somewhere between an internal and an external Lewis base, leading to its association with more acidic sites at the start of the reaction followed by its slow removal from the same during competition between the sites and TIBA [19]. However, the fact that the activity did not recover completely relative to that observed with the same catalyst in the absence of EB indicates that some irreversible reaction occurred during EB addition to the preformed catalyst and that the effect of this reaction was not reversed even by the addition of a large excess of TIBA. Hence the catalyst obtained by addition of EB is substantially different from the EB-free system even in the presence of a large amount of TIBA. 150 Effect of transition metal on catalytic performance The catalyst prepared from titanium [11] using the same procedure as that for the hafnium (i.e. catalyst 146) exhibits similar dependencies on the TIBA/transition metal and Hg/ethylene ratios, with an increase in both producing a decrease in SA and My; however, overall the activity is much larger while the molecular weight is comparable in magnitude to that for Hf (Table 7). It is interesting that while both SA and My show a parallel dependence on various parameters with the Hf-based catalyst, substitution of hafnium with titanium causes a remarkable increase of specific activity without a corresponding influence on the molecular weight. However, the dependence of polymer yield on time is similar for both catalysts, being virtually linear over the first 4 h. The corresponding intrinsic viscosities also increase over the first 30min and then attain an asymptotic value, again being very similar for both systems (Fig. 1). The kinetic curves obtained in the presence of the two catalysts are compared in Fig. 2 where SA has been plotted versus time for the Hf (Fig. 2(a)] and Ti catalysts [Fig. 2(b)]. From these curves it will be seen that the maximum initial activity (after a few minutes) is 2550 kg mol~1 h~1 bar\"1 for Ti but only QSkgmol\"1 h~1 bar\"1 for Hf, with this difference being quite substantially reduced after polymerization for 240 min, where the above figures are 388 and Sikgmol^h'^bar\"1, respectively. This result suggests that the active sites on the Hf-based catalyst exhibit a much better stability during the progress of the polymerization reaction. To improve understanding of the influence of the transition metal on the polymerization process and polymer properties, some comparative experi- ments have also been undertaken with catalytic system 155, prepared as previously but starting from zirconium derivatives [4]. In the absence of hydrogen (run BL66), this latter system displayed an TABLE 7 Influence of hydrogen/ethylene ratio on the specific activity (SA) and polyethylene intrinsic viscosity [if] in presence of Mg-Ti catalyst* Run Concn.

As far as viscosity is concerned, titanium again shows considerable Hg sensitivity while hafnium appears to be the least affected (Fig. 4). Conclusions The primary aim of this work was to provide further evidence of the role of Hf in hafnium-titanium bimetallic catalysts by studying the behaviour of similar monometallic catalysts based on hafnium. Better characterization of Hf derivatives as polymerization catalysts has been obtained and a compari- son with systems involving further investigated Ti and Zr catalysts has enabled a better understanding of the behaviour of Group IV transition metals as MgClg-supported polymerization catalysts. In this connection, it is certainly possible to conclude that in general, Hf catalysts exhibit only a limited tendency towards transfer reactions, and are much less sensitive towards hydrogen than Ti catalysts which display a much higher activity. Thus the polymer product obtained in the presence of Hf/Ti bimetallic systems under a hydrogen atmosphere as described in our previous paper [2] must be assumed to consist of a small number of long chains formed on Hf sites together with a much larger number of chains with 154 a low molecular weight formed on the Ti sites. The substantial effect of the addition of EB on both the specific activity of Hf catalysts and the molecular weight of the derived polymer is consistent with previous results concerning bimetallic catalysts which behaved as systems based solely on Ti in the presence of EB [2]. Such results suggest that EB preferentially deactivates Hf sites capable of polymerizing ethylene which exhibit little sensitivity towards hydrogenolysis. The bimetallic catalysts described previously [2] appear quite versatile for preparing polyethylenes possessing a wide spectrum of properties. Indeed, the results reported in this paper indicate the possibility of selectively modifying active Ti and Hf sites by changing the polymerization conditions and by the addition of specific reagents. In this connection, the combined use of two transition metals may be regarded as an additional tool for controlling the behaviour of catalytic systems to allow the characteristics of the derived polyethylene to be tailored in a more specific manner.
