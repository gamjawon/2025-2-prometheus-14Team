Graphical abstract Since H2O2 decomposition can result in selectivity/yield loss in the direct H2O2 synthesis process from H2 and O2 over supported Pd catalysts, it is important to have an enhanced understanding about the factors affecting the H2O2 decomposition reaction. Herein, detailed studies have been undertaken to investigate the influence of different factors, such as (a) nature and concentration of acid in reaction medium, (b) nature and concentration of halide in presence and absence of acid in reaction medium, (c) pretreatment procedures and (d) catalyst modification by incorporation of different halides, on the H2O2 decomposition reaction over a 5% Pd/C catalyst in aqueous medium at 25°C. This study has shown that the H2O2 decomposition activity is profoundly influenced by all the above factors. The effectiveness of the acids in suppressing the H2O2 decomposition activity decreased in the following order: hydroiodic acid>hydrobromic acid>hydrochloric acid≫acetic acid>phosphoric acid>sulfuric acid>perchloric acid. The ability of the acid to decrease the H2O2 decomposition activity was found to very strongly depend on the nature of its associated anion. Halides, such as iodide, bromide and chloride were particularly effective in suppressing the H2O2 decomposition activity. Oxidation pretreatment of the catalyst was found to strongly suppress its H2O2 decomposition activity, while a reduction treatment was found to promote its activity. A gradual decrease in the H2O2 decomposition activity of the catalyst was observed with each successive usage due to in situ sub-surface oxidation of Pd by H2O2. Halide incorporation either via the reaction medium or prior catalyst modification had a similar qualitative effect on the H2O2 decomposition activity. Keywords H2O2 decomposition H2O2 synthesis Pd catalysts Acid Halides Pretreatment 1 Introduction Direct synthesis of H2O2 (versatile and environmentally benign oxidizing agent) from H2 and O2 over supported precious metal catalysts is a commercially important environment-friendly process [1]. While other precious metals have also been investigated as catalysts for this process, the main focus has been on Pd-based catalysts [2–14]. H2O2, being thermodynamically less stable that water, is an intermediate product in the H2-to-H2O2 oxidation process. Its decomposition to water (H2O2 →H2O+0.5O2) is also catalyzed by Pd catalysts, which results in decreased H2O2 selectivity/yield in the H2-to-H2O2 oxidation process. In order to obtain high H2O2 selectivity in the process it is necessary to drastically reduce the H2O2 decomposition activity of the catalyst. It is therefore essential to obtain an enhanced understanding about the factors that influence the H2O2 decomposition activity of Pd catalysts. Our previous studies have suggested that factors, such as concentration of acid [15], oxidation state of Pd [7] and catalyst modification by halides [14] can have a significant influence on the H2O2 decomposition reaction over Pd catalysts. The current study was undertaken to obtain detailed systematic information on the various factors affecting the H2O2 decomposition reaction. The influence of the following factors has been investigated in this paper: (1) nature of the acid medium (acetic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, perchloric acid hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid and hydroiodic acid); (2) concentration of the acid (0.1–1.0M); (3) nature of halides (pottasium iodide, pottasium bromide, potassium chloride and pottasium fluoride) in presence and absence of acidic medium; (4) concentration of halides (2.7 and 24.3mmoldm−3); (5) oxidation (ex situ and in situ) and reduction treatments in presence and absence of acidic medium; (6) nature of halide promoters (I−, Br−, Cl−, F−) incorporated in Pd catalyst. 2 Experimental The Pd (5%)/C catalyst in its reduced form was obtained from Lancaster (UK). The PdO and/or Pd0 phases were confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction, using a Holland Phillips, PW/1730 X-ray generator with Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5406Å; 40kV, 25Ma). Also for studying the influence of different halides incorporated in the Pd/C catalyst on its H2O2 decomposition activity, 5wt% halogen (F, Cl, Br or I) was incorporated in the Pd/C catalyst by impregnating on it the respective ammonium halide from its aqueous solution using incipient wetness technique, drying and calcining in a flow of O2-free N2 (30cm3 min−1) at 400°C for 1h. Some of the catalysts were also characterized by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), using a VG-scientific ESCA-3 MK II electron spectrometer to confirm the presence of adsorbed halides. The H2O2 decomposition reaction over the catalysts was carried out using a magnetically stirred glass reactor (capacity: 250cm3) containing 0.2g catalyst in 150cm3 aqueous reaction medium, with or without containing acid and/or halide anions, by injecting 1ml of 30w/v% H2O2 solution in the reactor under vigorous stirring and measuring the gas (O2) evolved in the H2O2 decomposition at 25°C and atmospheric pressure, as a function of time, using a constant pressure gas collector [16]. The percent H2O2 decomposition data was estimated as follows: H 2 O 2 decomposition ( % ) = V t V T × 100 where, V t is the volume of O2 evolved in time t and V T is the volume of O2 evolved in the complete decomposition of H2O2 in the reactor. The H2O2 decomposition activity of the supported Pd catalysts was evaluated in term of a first order rate constant (k) according to the first order rate expression: ln[V T/(VT − V t )]= kC A t; where, V T is the volume of O2 evolved in the complete H2O2 decomposition, V t the volume of O2 evolved in time t and C A is the catalyst concentration/loading. Thermal decomposition (in absence of catalyst) was found to be insignificant for the duration of the reaction. Independent analysis of un-reacted H2O2 (via iodometric titration) was undertaken for selected experiments, which confirmed that the O2 evolved provided a true measure of H2O2 decomposition. Some of the experiments were repeated and an excellent reproducibility (within 5%) was observed for these experiments. As the reaction involved decomposition of small amounts of diluted H2O2 leading to the formation of H2O and O2 there were no significant safety issues related to these experiments. In order to study the influence of surface/sub-surface oxidation or reduction of Pd catalyst on its H2O2 decomposition activity, the Pd/C catalyst was pretreated by O2 and H2 before using the catalyst, as follows. The H2 or O2 gas pretreatment was carried out in the glass reactor containing the Pd/C catalyst in pure water or aqueous 0.1M H3PO4, first by flushing the reactor with O2-free N2 (30cm3 min−1) and then passing pure H2 or O2 through the reactor under vigorous stirring for 1h at room temperature. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Nature and concentration of acid medium Fig. 1 shows the effect of the nature of the acid on the H2O2 decomposition activity. While the catalyst showed very high activity for H2O2 decomposition in the aqueous medium, its activity was markedly reduced in the presence of the acids. The effectiveness of the acids in decreasing the H2O2 decomposition activity decreased in the following order: hydroiodic acid>hydrobromic acid>hydrochloric acid≫acetic acid>phosphoric acid>sulfuric acid>perchloric acid. The acids based on their ability to suppress the H2O2 decomposition activity, could be broadly classified into two groups: the oxyacids (acetic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid) which moderately decreased the H2O2 decomposition activity and the strongly suppressing halide acids (hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid and hydroiodic acid). Addition of the halide acids decreased the H2O2 decomposition activity by more than an order of magnitude (Fig. 2 ) as compared to a reaction medium without any acid. The effect of the acid concentration on the H2O2 decomposition activity is shown in Fig. 3 . In both the cases (sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid) there was a clear suppression of the H2O2 decomposition activity with increasing acid concentration (0.01–1.0M). This indicates that the H2O2 decomposition activity decreases with increasing proton concentration in the reaction medium. This may be attributed to the increased stability of H2O2 in presence of protons probably due to decreased interaction of the protonated H2O2 molecules with the catalyst surface. However, if the ability of the acid to donate protons to the reaction medium was the only criterion for determining the effectiveness of the acid, perchloric acid (which is a much stronger acid than acetic acid) would be expected to have a much larger effect on the H2O2 decomposition activity. Since this was not observed, it is apparent that the associated anions of the acid present in the reaction medium play an important role in determining the H2O2 decomposition activity. 3.2 Nature and concentration of halides in presence and absence of acidic reaction medium Since the halide acids were particularly efficient in decreasing the H2O2 decomposition activity, the effect of the halide ions was investigated in presence and absence of an acidic reaction medium. Results showing the influence of different halides (potassium salts) and their concentrations in the aqueous medium on the H2O2 decomposition over the reduced Pd/C catalyst are presented in Fig. 4 . The H2O2 decomposition activity of the catalyst was strongly suppressed in the presence of chloride, iodide and bromide anions in the reaction medium. In contrast the presence of fluoride ions had a negligible effect. The nature of the anion was thus found to be critical in determining the H2O2 decomposition activity. At a halide concentration of 2.7mmoldm−3, the effect of the anions in reducing the H2O2 decomposition activity decreased in the following order: Br− >I− >Cl− ≫F− Halide anions are known to adsorb on the catalyst surface [17]. Depending on their properties, it appears that the adsorbed anions block/modify the active catalytic sites and thereby influence the H2O2 decomposition activity. On increasing the concentration of the halide from 2.7 to 24.3mmoldm−3 the H2O2 decomposition activity further decreased in case of the Cl− and Br− ions, while there was no corresponding effect in case of F− ions. Interestingly, in case of the I− ions the H2O2 decomposition activity actually increased on increasing its concentration in the aqueous medium. This may be attributed to the homogeneous iodide (present in large excess) catalyzed decomposition of H2O2. Results showing the influence of different halide anions and their concentrations in the aqueous acidic reaction medium (0.1M H3PO4) on the decomposition of H2O2 over the reduced Pd/C catalyst are presented in Fig. 5 . The rate of H2O2 decomposition over the catalyst was drastically reduced in the presence of chloride, bromide or iodide anions in the acidic reaction medium. The H2O2 decomposition rate was further reduced with increasing halide (viz. Cl, Br− or I−) concentration in the acidic reaction medium. The observed decrease in the H2O2 decomposition activity may be attributed to combined presence of protons and halide anions (site poisoning) in the reaction medium. Interestingly, the H2O2 decomposition activity of the catalyst was increased in the presence of fluoride anions in the reaction medium. The catalytic activity for H2O2 decomposition was further increased with increasing the fluoride concentration in the reaction medium. Further studies need to be undertaken to understand this complex effect exhibited by F− ions in the acidic reaction medium. Based on these studies described in the previous two sections, it is apparent that the effectiveness of the acid for suppressing the H2O2 decomposition activity depends on the nature of its associated anions and its ability to donate protons to the reaction medium. 3.3 Catalyst pretreatment Results illustrating the influence of H2 and O2 pretreatments to the Pd/C catalyst on its H2O2 decomposition activity in non-acidic aqueous and acidic aqueous (0.1M H3PO4) reaction mediums are presented in Fig. 6 . While the H2 pretreated catalyst showed a very high H2O2 decomposition activity, the O2 pretreated catalyst showed much lower H2O2 decomposition activity. The observed much higher H2O2 decomposition activity of the H2 pretreated catalyst may be attributed to the surface/sub-surface reduction of Pd in the catalyst. Whereas, the lower H2O2 decomposition activity of the O2 pretreated catalyst may be related to the surface/sub-surface oxidation of Pd to PdO in the catalyst. The ability of Pd0 to from stable intermediate Pd–H species is expected to assist the H2O2 decomposition reaction. In line with the study described in the previous section, the H2O2 decomposition activity of the pretreated catalysts in the presence of acid was found to be considerably lower than that in the absence of the acid. Results showing the successive in situ pretreatment of the catalyst during the decomposition of H2O2 over the catalyst in aqueous medium on its H2O2 decomposition activity are presented in Fig. 7 . The H2O2 decomposition activity of the catalyst decreased after its use in the H2O2 decomposition. The observed gradual decrease in the H2O2 decomposition activity (Fig. 7) of the catalyst with each successive use may be attributed to the sub-surface oxidation of Pd by H2O2, which is a strong oxidizing agent. These results suggest that in the H2-to-H2O2 oxidation over reduced Pd catalyst, the activity and selectivity of the catalyst is expected to vary with the reaction time and usage pattern. 3.4 Halide-modified catalyst Results depicting the influence of different halide-modified Pd/C catalysts on its H2O2 decomposition activity in an aqueous acidic (0.05M H2SO4) reaction medium are presented in Fig. 8 . XRD analysis of the halide-modified catalyst showed that metallic Pd phase remained intact in the catalyst even after the halide incorporation procedure. The H2O2 decomposition activity of the catalyst increased markedly after its fluorination. However, incorporation of the chloride, bromide or iodide in the catalyst caused a reduction in the H2O2 decomposition activity of the catalyst. The influence of the incorporated halides in reducing the H2O decomposition decreased in the following order: I− >Br− >Cl− ≫F− It is noteworthy that presence of halide ions in form of potassium salts in the acidic reaction medium exhibited a similar influence on the H2O2 decomposition activity (Fig. 5). This may be related to the fact that even when the halides are introduced in the reaction medium, they are eventually adsorbed on the catalyst surface. 4 Concluding remarks 1. The effectiveness of the acids in decreasing the H2O2 decomposition activity decreased in the following order: hydroiodic acid>hydrobromic acid>hydrochloric acid≫acetic acid>phosphoric acid>sulfuric acid>perchloric acid. Presence of acid (proton donor) in the reaction medium decreased the decomposition activity by decreasing H2O2 adsorption on decomposition sites. 2. The H2O2 decomposition activity of the Pd/C catalyst was strongly suppressed in the presence of chloride, iodide and bromide anions in the reaction medium. In contrast the presence of fluoride ions had a promotional effect on the decomposition. The nature of the anion was thus found to be critical in determining the H2O2 decomposition activity. 3. While the H2 pretreated catalyst showed a very high H2O2 decomposition activity, the O2 pretreated catalyst showed much lower H2O2 decomposition activity. The observed much higher H2O2 decomposition activity of the H2 pretreated catalyst may be attributed to the surface/sub-surface reduction of Pd in the catalyst. Whereas, the lower H2O2 decomposition activity of the O2 pretreated catalyst may be related to the surface/sub-surface oxidation of Pd to PdO in the catalyst. 4. Halides whether present in the reaction medium or incorporated in the catalyst (via catalyst modification) had a similar qualitative effect on the H2O2 decomposition activity. References [1] A.
