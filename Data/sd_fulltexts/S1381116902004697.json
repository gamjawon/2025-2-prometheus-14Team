The double carbonylation of benzyl chloride to phenylpyruvic acid catalyzed by cobalt pyridine-2-carboxylate formed in one pot reaction has been studied. The effects of ligands, concentration of catalyst, solvent, temperature, CO pressure and the molar ratio of Ca(OH)2/PhCH2Cl on the conversion and selectivity have been discussed in detail. The double carbonylation of benzyl chloride to phenylpyruvic acid (PPA) catalyzed by CoCl2·6H2O and potassium pyridine-2-carboxylate (KPyca) in Ca(OH)2/dioxane/H2O system has been studied. The effects of ligands, concentration of catalysts, solvents, temperature, CO pressure and the molar ratio of Ca(OH)2/PhCH2Cl on the conversion and selectivity have been investigated. The conversion of benzyl chloride was 71.3%, and the yield of PPA was 70.1% with selectivity 98.3% when the reaction was carried out for 10h at 353K and 2.8MPa of CO in the Ca(OH)2/dioxane/H2O system, with CoCl2 0.035mol/l, KPyca 0.13mol/l, and the ratio of Ca(OH)2/PhCH2Cl 2.0. The product PPA was characterized by IR, 1H NMR, MS and UV. The mechanism of this catalytic reaction has also been discussed. Keywords Catalysis Double carbonylation Phenylpyruvic acid Cobalt pyridine-2-carboxylate 1 Introduction The catalytic double carbonylation of aryl halides to α-keto acids has been recently investigated by several research groups, both from industry and university [1,2]. In order to find a new and useful catalyst, a number of compounds such as cobalt and palladium complexes, Co2(CO)8 and PdCl2Ln, have been studied in the reaction [3,4]. Despite the good yield of α-keto acid, these catalysts often exhibit some disadvantages such as sensitivity to O2 and H2O in the reaction, and they are difficult to prepare because of harsh conditions. It is reported that cobalt complexes with Schiff-base ligands show very good catalytic activity in the oxidative carbonylation for the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate and the catalyst has also some advantages such as ease of preparation and handling [5]. It was considered interesting to test the catalytic activity of cobalt bis(2-pyridinecarboxylate)-tetrahydrate (Co(Pyca)2·4H2O) in the double carbonylation of benzyl chloride to α-keto acid. Recently a novel synthesis of PPA by double carbonylation of benzyl chloride catalyzed by Co(Pyca)2·4H2O in mild conditions has been reported by our group [6]. On the basis of preliminary studies we explored a convenient method of putting CoCl2 and KPyca into the autoclave to carry out the preparation of catalyst and double carbonylation simultaneously, as shown in Scheme 1 . This “one pot” method avoids the preparation of either Co2(CO)8 or Co(Pyca)2·4H2O, so it simplifies the process of synthesis. Here we report the details of our study on one pot formation of catalyst and double carbonylation of benzyl chloride. 2 Experimental All carbonylation reactions were conducted under CO in a 250ml autoclave. The experiments were carried out according to literature methods [6]. All reagents were used as received without further purification and CO purity is over 99.8%. IR spectra were recorded with an EQUINOX55 (BRUKER) spectrometer by using KBr pellers. 1H NMR were obtained on a Varian MERCURY-VX300 spectrometer in deuterodimethyl sulfoxide with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Mass spectra were recorded with a VG ZAB-3F. UV-Vis spectra were recorded on an UV-240 spectrometer. The basic data of PPA were characterized by IR, MS, 1H NMR and UV, and listed as following: Melting point: 156–157°C. MS (m/e): 164 (M+), 119, 91 (100%), 65, 45, 39. 1H NMR (300MHz, DMSO, δ, ppm/TMS): 4.124 (s, 1H), 6.381 (s, 1H), 7.184–7.748 (m,5H), 9.268 (s,1OH). IR (cm−1): 3473.42, 3220.50, 3112.56, 1697.25, 1624.38, 1492.06, 1456.49, 1382.32, 1294.70. UV(nm): 240, 365. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Screening of Schiff-base ligands N,N-donating and O,N-donating chelates are good bi-dentate ligands for metals. They have broad use in the field of wet analysis and homogeneous catalysis. Some Schiff-bases used as ligands in the catalytic system have been investigated, and shown in the Table 1 . It is found that KPyca has the highest catalysis activity among these species. Nicotinic acid and i-nicotinic acid whose structures are similar to KPyca have been found to have no activity. It is known that Co(II) coordinated with KPyca could form the active catalyst of five-membered ring structure (see the Scheme 2 ), but nicotinic acid and i-nicotinic acid are not beneficial to coordinate with Co(II) in that structure. 1,10-Phenanthroline and 2,2′-bipyridine are ligands of having expanded conjugated ring system. When they coordinate with Co(II), it is not advantageous to the insertion of CO molecular because of their larger steric demand compared with KPyca. This kind of structure leads to rather low yield of PPA in carbonylation. Imidazole has no catalysis function because it cannot coordinate with Co(II) to yield the active species. 3.2 Effects of the concentration of catalysts The effects of the concentration of catalysts on the yield are presented in Table 2 . When the concentration of KPyca keep 0.13mol/l, the yield of PPA increases at first and then decreases with the change of the concentration of CoCl2 from 0.07 to 0.0035mol/l, but no significant increase in the yield of PAA is observed under the reported experimental conditions. When the concentration of CoCl2 is too high with KPyca only 0.13mol/l, CoCl2 cannot convert into the catalyst rapidly and completely. The excess CoCl2 tends to produce Co(OH)2 in the basic environment, which reduces the activity of catalyst. While the concentration of CoCl2 is too low, it cannot produce enough active intermediates to catalyze the double carbonylation. In the reaction process, KPyca is a Schiff-base ligand to coordinate with cobalt. When the concentration of KPyca is too high with the concentration of CoCl2 only 0.007mol/l, the activity of catalyst in the double carbonylation will not increase very rapidly and the excess KPyca will be brought into the product, which is difficult to separate. When the concentration of KPyca is too low, it cannot produce enough intermediate. Taking into account of the yield of PPA and TON, the optimum concentration of CoCl2 is about 0.007mol/l with KPyca 0.054mol/l. 3.3 Effect of solvents Table 3 shows that the selectivity of products in reaction is critically influenced by the solvents. Miura reported that in the cobalt-catalyzed carbonylation of aryl halides using calcium hydroxide as the base in aqueous organic solvents, both the identity of the solvents and the content of water were the main factors determining the product composition [7]. In liquid reaction system, the solvent molecule tends to complex the central ion with the ligand. The stronger is the capability of donating electron pair of the solvent, the stronger is the capability of complexing the central ion from the original complex. Compared with other solvents, DO’s ability to donate electron pair is lower [8], so its capability of competing for the Co is lower, which results in the better stability of cobalt complex in DO. DO is a proton inactive solvent, which is different from the proton donor solvent that can lead to the disassociation of the cobalt complex to a certain extent because the ligand of Co can form hydrogen bond with the solvent molecule. In this way DO has the function of stabilizing and promoting for the form of intermediate in double carbonylation. On the other hand, the polar of solvent is an important factor. The lower polar solvent is favorable to the form of olefinic alcohol structure, and then is useful to the double carbonylation, which is consistent with the results of Foa and Francalanci [9]. 3.4 Effect of ratio of Ca(OH)2/PhCH2Cl The effect of the molar ratio of Ca(OH)2/PhCH2Cl is shown in Table 4 . The highest yield of PPA is obtained when the ratio of Ca(OH)2/PhCH2Cl is about 2.0. These facts suggest that Ca(OH)2 might be not strong enough to attack the carbon atom of the acyl intermediate, seeing Scheme 2, to give the product when the molar ratio of Ca(OH)2/PhCH2Cl is less than 2.0. However, when the ratio is greater than 2.0, the hydroxide in the liquid solvent may react with CoCl2 to produce Co(OH)2 and decreases the activity of the catalyst. 3.5 Effect of temperature Temperature strongly affects the yield of PPA in the reaction. The yield of PPA will increase with the elevation of temperature below 353K and will decrease above 353K as shown in Fig. 1 . In the carbonylation of organic halides by Co2(CO)8 or organic palladium catalyst system, the optimum temperature is 323K [10], which is different from the temperature range in our reaction system. The reason is that the catalyst in our reaction system is not Co(CO)4 − but Co(Pyca)2. When the temperature is above 353K, it is not favorable to the synthesis of catalyst and the form of olefinic alcohol intermediate. Moreover the carbonyl is easy to fall off from PPA when the temperature is increased. 3.6 Effect of CO pressure The effect of carbon monoxide pressure on the yield of PPA and PAA is shown in Fig. 2 . As expected, for the reaction of benzyl chloride, higher CO pressure enhances both the yield of PPA and PAA, but the increase of the yield of PPA is much greater than that of PAA. The increase of the yield of double carbonylation by means of increasing the CO pressure is usually common in catalytic carbonylation of organic chlorides [11]. A second insertion of carbon monoxide into intermediate is favored by increasing CO pressure. 3.7 Proposed catalytic mechanism The mechanism of carbonylation of halides to α-keto acids in our new catalytic system is accounted by the pathway outlined in Scheme 2. The elementary processes inferred on the mechanism are: (a) coordination of CoCl2 and KPyca to give the intermediate 1, which is coordinated with CO rapidly to form the saturated complex 2; (b) oxidative addition of PhCH2Cl to 2 to give arylcoblat halide 3; (c) a molecule of carbon monoxide inserts into the CoC bond in intermediate 3 to produce 4; (d) nucleophilic attack of hydroxyl ion on the carbon atom of the acyl intermediate 4 to give mono-carbonylation product PAA; (e) there is a tautometric equilibrium of ketone and olefinic alcohol structure in 4. Some conditions such as lower polar solvent or high CO pressure can promote the equilibrium moving to the side of olefinic alcohol; (f) in the weak alkali condition such as Ca(OH)2, a second carbon monoxide is absorbed by 5 to produce 6, perhaps because the nucleophilic ability of Ca(OH)2 is so poor that intermediate 5 is less susceptible to attack by hydroxide ion; (g) the attack of hydroxyl ion on species 6 to give double carbonylation product PPA. 4 Conclusions The work reported here has demonstrated the possibility of CoCl2 and potassium pyridine-2-carboxylate as a novel catalyst system in double carbonylation of benzyl chloride to phenylpyruvic acid. This one pot reaction could take place under mild condition and the catalyst is very easy to prepare and handle. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the yield of PPA is reasonable high. The mechanism of mono- and double carbonylation has been proposed. References [1] J. Collin J. Bull. Soc. Chim. Fran. 6 1988 976 981 [2] W.P. Fan P.K. Ouyang Q. Feng J. Nanjing Univ. Chem. Tech.

The effects of ligands, concentration of catalysts, solvents, temperature, CO pressure and the molar ratio of Ca(OH)2/PhCH2Cl on the conversion and selectivity have been investigated. The conversion of benzyl chloride was 71.3%, and the yield of PPA was 70.1% with selectivity 98.3% when the reaction was carried out for 10h at 353K and 2.8MPa of CO in the Ca(OH)2/dioxane/H2O system, with CoCl2 0.035mol/l, KPyca 0.13mol/l, and the ratio of Ca(OH)2/PhCH2Cl 2.0. The product PPA was characterized by IR, 1H NMR, MS and UV. The mechanism of this catalytic reaction has also been discussed.",
