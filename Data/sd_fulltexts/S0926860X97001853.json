Lavrent'ev St., 5, Novosibirsk, 630090, Russian Federation Received 21 March 1997; accepted 13 May 1997 Abstract It has been found that the rate of ammonia synthesis over the K2[Ru4(COh3]-based catalysts on carbonized magnesium oxide and the original graphite-like active carbon 'Sibunit' can be considerably enhanced by the introduction of cesium nitrate into the samples followed by reduction of the supported CsNO3 to cesium oxide or hydroxide with dihydrogen. In the case of the catalysts on carbonized magnesium oxide the greatest accelerating effect of cesium is manifested at Cs+ : Ru molar ratio of 1.51 : 1. Both an increase and a decrease in this ratio diminishes the activity of the system in ammonia synthesis. Analogous dependence on the amount of the cesium promoter is observed for the catalysts on 'Sibunit' carbon but in this case the position of the maximum activity is shifted towards larger cesium contents in the samples. The cesium-promoted catalyst on carbonized MgO is noticeably more active in ammonia synthesis than that on 'Sibunit' carbon. Keywords: Ammonia synthesis; Supported catalysts; Anionic ruthenium carbonyl clusters; Cesium nitrate Previously, we had reported the first catalysts on carbon support exhibiting activity in ammonia synthesis in the absence of a specially added electron promoter [ 1 ]. The catalysts were prepared by depositing K2[Ru4(CO) 13], K2[Os3(CO) 11] and K2[Fe2(CO)8] from THF solutions on the original graphite-like active carbon 'Sibunit' [2] followed by drying of the supported sample at 20 in vacuum. The best results were obtained for ruthenium catalyst which turned out to be active in * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

It has been shown that the replacement of 'Sibunit' by conventional commercial active carbons result in a sharp decrease in activity and stability of the catalysts. At the same time, the use of such supports as carbonized magnesium oxide and pure magnesium oxide instead of 'Sibunit' increased significantly the efficiency of the K2[Ru4(CO) 13] catalyst in ammonia synthesis [3]. Apparently, the role of electron promoter in all these catalysts is played by potassium originated from the initial anionic cluster. Here we report that the rate of ammonia synthesis on the K2[Ru4(CO) 13]-based catalysts can be still further increased when one more promoter, viz. cesium nitrate, is introduced into the system. The promoting effect of cesium nitrate on supported ruthenium ammonia synthesis catalysts has been demonstrated earlier (see, e.g. Refs. [4,5]). It is suggested that cesium oxide or cesium hydroxide plays a role of the actual promoter in such types of systems. For the promoting effect of potassium metal on ammonia synthesis catalysts based on supported K2[Ru4(CO)13], K2[Os3(CO)ll] and K2[Fe2(CO)8] see, e.g. Refs. [6-10]. The initial K2[Ru4(CO)13] was prepared by the interaction of Ru3(CO)12 with potassium-benzophenone in THF under Ar [11 ]. The above-mentioned carbonized magnesium oxide (71 m2/g, 19.5 wt.% C) and graphite-like active carbon 'Sibunit' (500 m2/g, 99.5 wt.% C) were used as supports. Characteristic features of 'Sibunit' carbon are an increased amount of mesopores as well as very low content of sulphur, mineral admixtures and other impurities. Before impregnation, 'Sibunit' carbon was dried at 130 in vacuum for 6-8 h, while carbonized MgO was dried at 400 in a dihydrogen stream for 11 h. The catalysts not containing cesium (the Ru loading=9 wt.%) were obtained by the method mentioned earlier. Preparation of the cesium-promoted catalysts was conducted in the following manner. At first, the support was impregnated with small amount of K2[Ru4(CO)13] in THF (the Ru loading=l.5 wt.%), after which the supported cluster was decomposed by heating at 3000C in H2 stream (7.5 l/h) for 6 h. Then the sample obtained was impregnated with aqueous CsNO3 solution and, after removal of water, was heated in a dihydrogen flow (7.5 l/h) for 11-12 h at 400. During the course of heating, cesium nitrate was reduced with dihydrogen to cesium oxide or hydroxide under the action of supported ruthenium as catalyst. The reduction of cesium nitrate was evidenced by the appearance (in the gas flow) of considerable amounts of ammonia which gradually disappeared with time. After completion of the CsNO3 reduction, the sample was impregnated with the main portion of K2[Ru4(CO)13] in THF (the Ru loading=9 wt.%) and dried at 20 in vacuum. Experiments on ammonia synthesis were carried out in a flow-type glass reactor at 250-400 and atmospheric pressure with use of stoichiometric N2-H2 mixture (flow rate=101/h). Testing the catalysts was started from 250, then the temperature was successively raised to 300, 350 and 400. The ammonia concentration in the gas flow was determined by the method described in Ref. [6]. All manipulations with K2[Ru4(CO)13] and the corresponding catalysts were S.M.

The amount of Ru in the catalysts not containing the cesium promoter is 2.2-2.3 mmol. The weight of the catalysts was determined after their testing in ammonia synthesis at 250--400. conducted under Ar or in vacuum with careful exclusion of air oxygen and moisture. The results obtained are given in Table 1 from which it is seen that an introduction of cesium nitrate into the catalysts exerts a considerable influence on their efficiency in ammonia synthesis. In the case of the catalysts on 'Sibunit' carbon, the presence of small amounts of cesium in the sample (Cs: Ru molar ratio is 0.8 : 1) leads to some decrease in activity of the system in ammonia formation (at 250-350) but at higher cesium contents the ammonia synthesis rate significantly increases reaching a maximum, the position of which is depen- dent upon the reaction temperature. At 300 the highest activity in dinitrogen hydrogenation is observed for the catalyst with Cs+ : Ru molar ratio of 3.1 : 1. The steady ammonia concentration in the gas flow at this temperature on the catalyst of such composition amounts to 0.42 vol.% which is 2.5 times as high as that on using the catalyst not containing the cesium promoter. At 350 the greatest accelerating effect of cesium is manifested at Cs+ : Ru molar ratio of 2.1 : 1 but at this temperature the difference in activities of the cesium-promoted and unpromoted samples is smaller because the steady ammonia concentration in the gas on the catalyst containing cesium is already close to the corresponding equilibrium value. A rise in the Cs+ Ru molar ratio to 4.2 1 decreases activity of the catalyst at 300 and 350. At 400 the process of ammonia synthesis at Cs+ : Ru molar ratios of 2.1-4.2 : 1 attains the equilibrium. Still more efficient system for ammonia synthesis is obtained when cesium nitrate is introduced into the catalyst on carbonized magnesium oxide (Table 1). L38 S.M. Yunusov et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) L35-L39 Here the activity of the system in ammonia synthesis also passes through a maximum with an increase in the amount of cesium promoter however this maximum is reached at a noticeably less cesium quantity in the sample (Cs+ : Ru--1.51 : 1) than in the case of the above-mentioned catalysts on 'Sibunit' carbon. On using the optimum Cs+ : Ru molar ratio, the ammonia content in the gas stream at 300 over the catalyst on carbonized magnesium oxide amounts to 0.52 vol.% which corresponds to 24% of an equilibrium value. The catalyst not containing the cesium promoter gives two times lower ammonia concentration in the gas under the same conditions. At 350 and 400 the reaction of ammonia synthesis over the cesium-promoted catalyst on carbonized MgO fully reaches the equilibrium. A greater activity of the catalysts on carbonized magnesium oxide as compared to that on 'Sibunit' carbon is apparently due to the electron-donating effect of highly basic MgO (cf. Refs. [ 12,3]). As a result of this effect the electron density on ruthenium atoms increases which must favour the efficient dinitrogen activation. Similar functions of electron donors are fulfilled by the cesium and potassium promoters arising from CsNO3 and the initial anionic cluster K2[Ru4(CO)13], respectively. Therefore, one may suggest that magnesium oxide is not only the part of the support in the K2[Rua(CO)13]-based catalysts on carbonized MgO but, simultaneously, it plays a role of a peculiar electron promoter. At present we are studying the nature of particles responsible for the activity of the catalysts found in ammonia synthesis.
