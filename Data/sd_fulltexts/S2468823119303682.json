Catalysis and Inorganic Chemistry Division CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory Dr. Homi Bhabha Road Pune 411008 India Graphical abstract Up-gradation of lignin derived monomers to value-added and fuel grade products is important to make overall bio-refinery process economical. Although, few studies are devoted on this work yet, systematic study on commercially viable (low loading of metal, recyclable catalyst, mild conditions, high selectivities etc.) is scarce and typically done under harsh conditions. Herein, we report, the methodical effect of support (SiO2, Al2O3 (acidic, basic and neutral), SiO2-Al2O3) on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignin derived various monomers, guaiacol, veretrol, eugenol, phenol using very low loading (0.5 wt%) Ru catalyst. Very high yield (82%) of cyclohexanol from guaiacol could be achieved in presence of cyclohexane as a solvent and Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst at 225 °C and under 1 MPa H2 pressure. The detailed study on the effect of solvent, stability and adsorption of reactant & products etc. is done and it was observed that products are more prone to adsorb and undergo further reactions. The complete characterization of fresh and spent catalysts revealed that lower catalyst reduction temperature and presence of Ru in partially higher oxidation state proved by XPS, helps in enhancing the cyclohexanol formation. Subsequently, role of Ru particle size and support on the activity was also investigated. Keywords Lignin Hydrodeoxygenation Supported metal catalyst Cyclohexanol Reaction pathway 1 Introduction Lignocellulosic biomass, made up of cellulose (40–50%), hemicellulose (20–30%) and lignin (15–30 wt%) is considered as an alternative resource to fossil feedstock due to its renewability and abundant cost effective availability. Lignin, an aromatic biopolymer is mainly composed of substituted oxygenated aromatic monomers such as, p-coumaryl, coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols. [1,2] The lignin fraction of biomass is more attractive to produce alternative fuels because it has a lower oxygen-to-carbon ratio (O/C = 0.3-0.5) compared to carbohydrate part (O/C = 1, for e.g. glucose, C6H12O6) of lignocellulose. [3] It is reported that via thermal (pyrolysis) and thermochemical (gasification, cracking etc.) routes, biomass (lignin) can be converted into crude bio-oil [4,5]. This crude bio-oil is a mixture of various oxygen containing compounds like carboxylic acids, ketones, aldehydes, carbohydrates, furans, phenolic compounds, and many other sugar based compounds [6,7]. However, due to higher oxygen content in these compounds, their application as fuel is restricted. Hence, bio-oil is typically subjected to catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction to lower the oxygen content and improve its energy value [8,9]. Thus, in order to produce fuels from lignocellulosic biomass two prong strategy needs to be developed in which first step is the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to crude bio-oil and in a second step, up-gradation of bio-oil through HDO process to decrease the oxygen content is required [10]. Further, cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone (KA oil) are the intermediates in the synthesis of adipic acid however, currently KA oil is obtained either by hydrogenation of phenol or oxidation of cyclohexane/cyclohexene which are obtained from fossil feedstock [11]. It can be suggested that if the KA oil is obtained from lignin instead of fossil feedstock, it would be beneficial for the bio-refinery concept. The expected market for adipic acid is approximately USD7000 million in 2019 which makes it one of the most interesting molecule to synthesize. In view of this, research is devoted on the KA oil synthesis from lignin via depolymerisation and HDO-ring hydrogenation of depolymerized aromatic monomers. In a typical HDO process, oxygenates are reacted with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst to remove oxygen via C–O bond cleavage [3,7,12]. Precious metals like Ru, Pt, Pd with high loading decorated over various supports are required for the HDO of bio-oil at elevated temperatures (>300 °C) and pressures (˜7 MPa H2) to cleave C–O bonds due to i) higher bond dissociation energy (414 kJ/mol) and ii) partial double bond character to C–O bond in phenolic compounds due to resonance. [13,14] Guaiacol is one of the depolymerized product of lignin and it has different types of oxygen-carbon bonds similar to those found in lignin: Ar(C)-O−CH3 [C(sp3)–OAr (methoxy group), C(sp2)–OMe] and C(sp2)−OH (hydroxyl) having bond energies of 247, 356 and 414 kJ/mol, respectively. [4] Considering this, much of the research is devoted on the use of guaiacol as a representative compound of lignin derived chemicals for HDO reactions. In our earlier works, we have shown that the solid acids [15,16], solid bases [17] and acidic ionic liquids [18,19] can depolymerise lignin under milder conditions (<250 °C, N2) to yield low molecular weight aromatic compounds including guaiacol. It is reported that Ru/C could catalyse HDO reaction of bio-oil at 340 °C under 8 MPa H2 pressure in aqueous medium to yield mixture of upgraded monomers. [13] Ru/ZrO2-WOx catalyst is too reported for the formation of mixture of products (cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone, cyclopentanone) at 270 °C and 4 MPa H2 pressure. [20] Pd-WOx/Al2O3 catalyst at 300 °C and 7 MPa H2 in n-decane solvent is shown to give 88% cyclohexane yield. [21] Comparative study of Pd, Ru (240–330 °C) and Mo2C (330–375 °C) supported on carbon is done at 3.4 MPa of H2 in decaline solvent and it was observed that at lower temperatures (240 °C) predominantly ring hydrogenation occurs and at elevated temperature of 300 °C, C–O bond cleavage is possible. [22] Earlier we have exemplified that with a change of support from basic (HT) to neutral (AC) to acidic (Al2O3), product selectivity (ring hydrogenation to partial HDO) alters and with highly acidic support (SiO2-Al2O3), complete HDO activity is possible to achieve. Incidentally, change in selectivity of the products was devoid of metal used (Pt, Ru, Pd with 3.5 wt% loading). [23] Recently, in a comparative study of Pt/HY and Pt/HZSM5 catalysts on the basis of strength and amount of acidic sites, HDO of guaiacol at 250 °C and under 4 MPa H2 in decane solvent is reported. It has been shown that due to optimal acidic properties in Pt/HY catalyst compared with Pt/HZSM5 catalyst, it showed better HDO activity. [24] Ru/SiO2 catalyst has shown complete conversion of guaiacol with 55% yield of cyclohexane in n-dodecane at 300 °C and 5 MPa H2 [25]. The HDO activities of bimetallic catalysts like, 4 wt%-1 wt%RuRe/C and RuRe/MWCNT are also evaluated at 200 °C and 2 MPa H2 in n-heptane medium and with guaiacol as a substrate, approximately 60% cyclohexanol formation was seen. [26] A careful look at the literature suggests that with precious metals, high activity is obtained at high temperatures (typically >250 °C) and high hydrogen pressures (2 MPa – 8 MPa). It is also suggested that since precious metals are highly active, those may catalyse further reactions and coke formation and gaseous products formation becomes predominant at the expense of desired compounds, cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone. Though precious metals demonstrate good HDO activity, but due to high loadings (>3 wt%) required to achieve respectable activity, researchers have extensively focused their works on the use of non-precious transition metal based catalysts. In view of this, CoMoS, NiMoS or Mo2N catalysts are evaluated for HDO at 300 °C and 4 MPa H2 [27–33]. However, these catalysts have exhibited lower activity and contamination of products with sulfur was also seen [27–34]. Besides sulfur containing catalysts, Ni and Fe based catalysts are also used for the HDO of lignin model compounds but those showed respectable activities at very high temperatures (>350 °C) resulting in undesired by-product formation like CH4 and CO. [35–37] NiCo/Al2O3 catalyst is also reported for the HDO of guaiacol to yield cyclohexanol as a major product (70%) at 200 °C and 5 MPa H2 pressure in aqueous medium. [38] Recently, CuNi/Ti-MCM-41 catalyst is demonstrated for HDO of guaiacol at 260 °C and 10 MPa H2 in heptane solvent to achieve 74% conversion of guaiacol with 48% selectivity to cyclohexane. [39] Typically, it is seen that the catalysts with higher acid sites show better activity for HDO. Additionally, different studies have shown that the activation of hydroxyl group is possible in presence of the transition metal along with acid sites. In a bifunctional supported metal catalyst, metal splits H2 and acidic sites are responsible for the cleavage of C–O bond(s). [2,40–42] A careful study of the published research reveals that with aqueous and high boiling solvents like decane (174.1 °C), dodecane (216.3 °C) and hexadecane (286.9 °C), HDO reactions typically occur ≥250 °C and >3 MPa H2 pressure. However in low boiling solvents such as heptane (98.4 °C), HDO activity can be achieved at lower temperatures and lower H2 pressures (<250 °C and <2 MPa H2). This indicates that for a HDO reaction to occur, minimum threshold pressure is required which can be achieved with high boiling solvents at higher temperatures but with low boiling solvents is achieved at lower temperatures. Nevertheless, possibility of solubility of hydrogen in these solvents at given temperatures is required to be examined. Thus, it becomes essential to understand this underlying chemistry and develop a catalytic system which would use lower precious metal loading and operate under lower temperature and pressures. It is anticipated that in the presence of low boiler solvent, and bifunctional catalyst having noble metal in combination with acidic support, could be the better alternative to achieve HDO activity under moderate temperature (175–225 °C) and lower H2 pressure (<2 MPa). Moreover, in most of the earlier studies, higher loading (> 3 wt%) of precious metals is reported which might not be economically viable. Hence the objective of this work was to use very low loading of noble metal and study the effect of support in presence of low boiler as well as thermally stable solvents like hexane (B.P =68 °C) and cyclohexane (80.7 °C). Earlier it is shown by experimental and theoretical evidence that cyclohexane is stable at higher temperature. [43,44] Additionally, effect of catalytic system on various other lignin derived aromatic monomers was also checked. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials n-hexane (99%), cyclohexane (99.9%), phenol (99.5%), eugenol (99%), RuCl3 (45–55%), Ru/Al2O3-Acidic (commercial) catalyst, and various supports (SiO2-Al2O3, γ-Al2O3 acidic, basic, and neutral) used in the catalyst synthesis were procured from Aldrich Chemicals, USA. Guaiacol (99%), anisole (99%), veratrol (98%), and 4-propyl cylohexanol (>98%) were purchased from Loba Chemie, India. trans-2methoxy cyclohexanol (99%) was procured from Alfa Aesar, India. 4-propyl phenol (99%) was purchased from TCI Chemicals, India. Besides supports, all the other chemicals were used as received. 2.2 Catalyst synthesis Supported Ru metal catalysts (Ru/Al2O3, Ru/SiO2, Ru/SiO2-Al2O3) were prepared by wet-impregnation method. Before the synthesis of a catalyst, supports (Al2O3, SiO2, SiO2-Al2O3) were activated at 150 °C under vacuum for 6 h to remove any moisture adsorbed. In a catalyst synthesis procedure, 2 g of activated Al2O3-Acidic was immersed in 10 mL of water and was kept under vigorous stirring for 30 min. To this, 2 mL aqueous solution of RuCl3 containing 0.098 mmol of Ru (0.5 wt% Ru/Support) was added drop wise and the resultant mixture was stirred for 16 h at 35 °C. This is followed by evaporation of water at 60 °C using rotary evaporator. The powder obtained was dried at 60 °C in oven for 16 h followed by vacuum drying at 150 °C for 6 h. Further this dry powder was reduced under the flow of hydrogen (H2, 10 mL•min−1) for 2 h at 150 °C. The obtained catalyst was named as Ru/Al2O3-Acidic. Similar procedure was used to prepare all the other catalysts (Ru/Al2O3-Basic, Ru/Al2O3-Neutral, Ru/SiO2 and Ru/SiO2-Al2O3). 2.3 Catalytic runs Hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol was performed in a 100 mL hastelloy high pressure high temperature Parr make reactor. In a typical reaction, 2.15 wt% guaiacol solution (23 g) in cyclohexane with guaiacol/Ru molar ratio of 165 was charged in the reactor. The reactor was flushed with H2 for 3–4 times to remove any air. Then, the reactor was pressurised with H2 up to desired pressure (0.3–1 MPa at R.T) and was heated under slow stirring (100 rpm) until desired reaction temperature (175–250 °C) was reached. After attaining the reaction temperature, stirring was increased to 1000 rpm and this time was considered as a starting time of the reaction. Reactions with other substrates (eugenol, veretrol, anisole, phenol) were carried out using similar charge. With 1 MPa pressure charged at R.T, under reaction temperature of 225 °C, 3.1 MPa pressure was observed. 2.4 Recycle experiments After completion of a reaction, the catalyst (solid) was recovered by centrifugation of the reaction mixture. The recovered wet catalyst was used in the next reaction without any pre-treatment. In addition, to check the catalyst activity by maintaining S/C ratio (substrate to catalyst molar ratio) constant, the residual solvent of recovered wet spent catalyst from third run was removed by heat treatment of catalyst at 60 °C for 12 h. The dried catalyst was used to carry out the fourth run without further treatment. 2.5 Analysis of reaction mixture After completion of reaction, reactor was allowed to cool to room temperature under air flow. The reaction mixture was collected and centrifuged to separate solid and liquid. The liquid was then filtered through a 0.22 μm syringe filter and used for gas chromatography (Agilent GC) analysis. GC was equipped with HP-5 capillary column (0.25 μm ×0.32 mm ×50 m), flame ionization (FID) detector (30 mL•min−1 N2 flow as carrier gas) and the oven temperature programme was as follows: 100 °C (hold time, 1 min) to 270 °C (hold time, 10 min) at 10 °C min−1 ramp rate. The injector temperature used was 270 °C. Detector was kept at 275 °C. The GC–MS (Agilent-7890 GC and Agilent MS-5977A MSD) equipped with DB-5 MS column (0.25 μm ×0.25 mm ×30 m) was used for the analysis. Temperature program used was similar to that for GC-FID. The NIST library was used for product identification. Following formulae are used for the calculation of conversion and yields.

The Ru/SiO2 (305 m2 g−1) and Ru/SiO2-Al2O3 (376 m2 g−1) catalysts showed higher surface area than Ru/Al2O3-Neutral (143 m2 g−1), Ru/Al2O3-Basic (147 m2 g−1), Ru/Al2O3-Acidic (142 m2 g−1) and Ru/Al2O3-Acidic (commercial) (144 m2 g−1) catalysts owing the difference in the surface area of respective supports. Inductive Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis was performed for the synthesized catalysts to quantify the metal loadings on the supports. The results suggest that except in case of SiO2 support, experimental loadings are almost similar to that of theoretical loadings (Table S2, ESI). In x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all Ru catalysts (Figure S1, ESI) besides characteristic peaks for support, no peak for Ru and RuOx were observed suggesting that Ru is well dispersed on the supports. The same observation is also confirmed by TEM analysis. In the XRD patterns of the Ru/SiO2 and Ru/SiO2-Al2O3 catalysts broad peak for amorphous nature of support was observed between 12–32 °. From the Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images of Ru/Al2O3-Acidic (Figure S2a, ESI), it is seen that Ru particles with average size of 3–5 nm are well dispersed on the support. Similar trend was found with other Al2O3 supported (Basic and Neutral) catalysts as seen from (Figure S2b, ESI). With a change of support to SiO2, average particle size of metal was 10–14 nm and with SiO2-Al2O3 support it was 7–11 nm (Figure S3, ESI). CO chemisorption studies (Table S3, ESI) were performed to determine the particle size of Ru and dispersion of Ru on the supports. For Ru/SiO2 catalyst, the volume of chemisorbed CO was 5.6 μmol•g−1 which indicates 11.4% dispersion of Ru with 11.8 nm of crystalline size of Ru. In case of Al2O3 supported Ru catalysts, dispersion of Ru was 59 to 72% with an average crystallite size of 1.84 to 2.27 nm, that essentially reflects the fact that dispersion is almost similar and we can compare the activity of these catalysts with each other. This is important considering the structure sensitive dependence of this reaction. The Ru/SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst showed 44% dispersion with 3.05 nm of crystallite size. The crystallite size determined from CO chemisorption data is in line with the particle size calculated from TEM images. 3.1.2 Determination of reducibility of metal Temperature Programme Reduction (TPR) study reveals that Ru was reduced at very low temperature of 85 °C (Figure S4, ESI), possibly due to very low loading of metal (0.5 wt%) on the support and very high dispersion (72%, Table S3, ESI) observed. Further to understand the oxidation state of Ru on the support, XPS analysis of synthesized catalysts was performed. When XPS measurements for Ru 3d3/2 were done, the broad peak at B.E. of 284 eV was observed to be overlapping with C1s (B.E. = 284.8 eV) (Figure S5, ESI) and hence no conclusion could be drawn regarding oxidation state of Ru. A small peak observed at B.E. of 279.9 eV is attributed to the 3d5/2 level of Ru for Ru metal (0). Since, for RuO2 species, peak is typically observed at higher B.E. related to Ru(0), again due to overlapping of broad peak for C1s, no conclusions could be drawn. Subsequently, XPS measurements for Ru were done at 3P3/2 level. Peak observed at B.E. of 461.2 eV indicated presence of Ru(0) and peak seen at B.E. of 463.7 eV implied presence of RuO2 species. [45] 3.1.3 Acidity and basicity study For the measurement of acidity of the catalysts, TPD analysis with probe molecule, NH3 was performed (Figure S6; Table S4, ESI). As seen, bare support Al2O3-Acidic showed NH3 desorption peak at 200 °C and when Ru was loaded on the support, additional sharp peak for NH3 desorption was observed at 335 °C. Similarly, additional peak in Ru/Al2O3-Neutral catalyst and Ru/SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst was also observed at 335 °C. The broad peak with peak maxima observed at around 200 °C in all the catalysts along with bare supports was suggested to be due to the desorption of NH3 from the surface of the sample. However, an additional sharp peak observed after Ru loading can be assigned for the desorption of NH3 from the different site on catalyst, which is indicated to be a Ru species. While electron rich Ru in metallic state may not interact with NH3, it is possible that Ru in electron deficient state such as Ru present in higher oxidation states (II, IV) may have interaction with NH3. While this interaction would be stronger than interaction of NH3 with Al2O3 support, higher desorption temperature of 335 °C was seen. Nevertheless, to prove that Ru is present in higher oxidation state, XPS analysis was performed and data suggests that Ru is indeed present in higher oxidation state along with in metallic state. Nonetheless, with SiO2 as a support, no peak for NH3 desorption was seen, which was obvious because SiO2 is considered as neutral support but, even after loading of Ru on SiO2, no peak at around 335 °C was seen. These observations clearly suggest that metal-support interaction plays very crucial role in stabilizing Ru in different oxidation states. Later, TPD with CO2 as a probe molecule was carried out for Ru/Al2O3-Basic catalyst however, no peak for the CO2 desorption was observed. From the catalysts characterization study, it is revealed that Ru is highly dispersed on the Al2O3 support with small crystallite size and mainly it is present in higher oxidation state. 3.2 Catalyst activity Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reactions were carried out in high pressure high temperature batch mode reactors and the analysis of the reaction mixture was done on GC (for details please refer experimental section). 3.2.1 Effect of support on the HDO of guaiacol As can be seen from the Fig. 1 , with constant Ru (0.5 wt%) loading but with the change in the support; activity of the catalyst with selectivity for the product formation has changed when reactions were carried out at 225 °C, under 1 MPa H2 pressure for 4 h in cyclohexane as a solvent. With neutral SiO2 as a support, formation of 47% cyclohexanol was observed with 72% conversion of guaiacol. However, when instead of SiO2, Al2O3-Neutral was used to support Ru, increase in the conversion (100%) was seen along with increase in cyclohexanol formation (55%). Additionally, formation of an intermediate product, trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol with 25% yield was also seen. This result was surprising considering that both SiO2 and Al2O3-Neutral were considered as neutral supports. However, as shown above, in case of Al2O3-Neutral support very weak acidity (0.16 mmol•g−1) was seen. Moreover, CO chemisorption data indicated that crystallite size of Ru on Al2O3-Neutral was too small (2.18 nm) compared to on SiO2 support (11.8 nm). These two factors might have played important role in increasing the overall activity of the catalyst. Considering this, acidic Al2O3 was used to support Ru and the activity was evaluated under similar conditions. As observed, with Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst, improvement in the yield for cyclohexanol (77%) was achieved compared to neutral Al2O3 (55%). Besides cyclohexanol as a product, formation of trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol (12%) was seen, which was lower than Al2O3-Neutral supported catalyst (25%). In view of this result, crystallite size of Ru was checked for both the catalysts (Al2O3-Neutral, Al2O3-Acidic) and it was seen that over both the supports, Ru crystallite size is almost similar (1.86 nm, 2.18 nm; Table S3, ESI). Hence, it can be effectively said that the acidity of the support is playing important role in the cleavage of C–O bond and thus acidic Al2O3 supported Ru catalyst showed higher cyclohexanol yield than neutral Al2O3 supported Ru catalyst. These results suggest that the adsorption of oxygenated compound (s) on the acidic supports might be higher which results in the formation of cyclohexanol as a product. In regard to this, activity of basic Al2O3 supported Ru catalyst was evaluated and it was seen that the catalyst gave 64% cyclohexanol yield with 31% yield for trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol. As expected on the basic support, C–O cleavage activity was lower however, higher GC based carbon balance (considering GC based conversions and yields of products) was observed (95%) compared to acidic Al2O3 (89%) and neutral Al2O3 (80%) supported Ru catalysts. This can be explained on the basis of coke formation on the catalyst during the reaction. In order to substantiate this suggestion, CHNS elemental analysis of spent Ru/SiO2-Al2O3 and spent Ru/Al2O3-Basic catalysts was carried out and it proved the adsorption of coke on the catalyst surfaces was more on acidic support [Ru/SiO2-Al2O3 (9.50% C and 1.12% H) and Ru/Al2O3-Basic (4.15% C and 0.54% H)]. This is due to a well-known fact that on basic supports formation of coke is always lower compared to acidic supports over which cracking reactions are predominant. Since, best cyclohexanol formation activity was seen on Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst, commercially procured Ru/Al2O3-Acidic (commercial) catalyst, which is known to have mild acidity was also checked for its activity and almost similar activity was observed with the catalyst synthesized in the laboratory. Later, Ru/SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst was also evaluated for its activity for HDO of guaiacol nevertheless even if 68% conversion of guaiacol was observed, no cyclohexanol formation was seen. This can be explained on the fact that SiO2-Al2O3 has higher acidity (0.54 mmol•g−1) with Ru crystallite size of 3.05 nm and thus catalyst might be highly active to yield cyclohexane as a product, which incidentally we could not quantify as reaction media is same. To compare the activity of different catalysts and the role of support on the reaction, TOF calculations were done while reactions were performed for shorter time of 1 h at 225 °C under 1 MPa H2 pressure. Following order of TOF was observed: Ru/SiO2 (Conv.:36%, TOF: 26,855 h−1) > Ru/SiO2-Al2O3 (Conv.: 34%; TOF: 6555 h−1) > Ru/Al2O3-Neutral (Conv.: 42%; TOF: 6063 h−1) > Ru/Al2O3-Basic (Conv.: 40%; TOF: 5740 h−1) > Ru/Al2O3-Acidic (commercial) (Conv.: 39%; TOF: 3477 h−1) ≥ Ru/Al2O3-Acidic (Conv.: 37%; TOF: 3450 h−1) Even if highest TOF was seen with Ru/SiO2 catalyst in shorter reaction time, obviously due to bigger particle size of Ru compared to other catalysts, but inferior conversions (72%, 4 h) and lower yield of cyclohexanol (47%, 4 h) with poor carbon balance/atom efficiency (65%, 4 h) is detrimental for the reaction. Nonetheless, TOF values needs to be explained based on the structure sensitive/insensitive aspect of HDO reaction. To check whether during the reactions methane is obtained as methanol would form after the cleavage of C–O bond (Ar−OCH3), vent gas was analysed by GC equipped with TCD. However, formation of methane or any other gas was not detected. Moreover, based on the GC equipped with FID analysis of reaction mixture, formation of methanol with almost 92% equivalent to HDO of guaiacol was seen, which confirmed that methanol does not undergo any further conversions. 3.2.2 Effect of temperature Since, Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst showed the best cyclohexanol yield (77%) in the reaction amongst all the catalysts when reaction was carried out at 225 °C, to improve the yield of cyclohexanol further, effect of reaction temperature (175, 200, 225 and 250 °C) on the HDO activity of this catalyst was studied and the results are shown in Fig. 2 . Catalyst could even at 175 °C exhibit 100% conversion of guaiacol however, at this temperature, C–O bond cleavage activity was lower as is evident from the higher yield of ring hydrogenation product, trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol (40%). With an increase in temperature to 200 °C, enhancement in the yield of cyclohexanol (82%) along with 17% yield of trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol was observed (99% carbon balance). However, with further increase in temperature to 225 °C, catalyst showed slight decrease in cyclohexanol yield (77%) and also trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol yield (12%) (89% carbon balance). In order to check whether at higher temperature, cyclohexanol yield remains constant, reaction was done at 250 °C but lower yields were seen. Based on these results, it can be suggested that at lower temperature (175 °C) the activity of catalyst for the formation of HDO product is low and at 250 °C since the significant decrease in the yield of cyclohexanol (37%) was observed with only 15% trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol formation, side reactions such as coke formation or gaseous products formation are predominant. Moreover, this is implied due to observance of lower carbon balance (52%) with an increase in temperature to 250 °C. To check whether gaseous products are formed at higher reaction temperatures, after the reaction, gas analysis was done on GC equipped with TCD but no gaseous product formation was seen. As one of the possibility, the decrease in the yield of cyclohexanol at 250 °C could be due to its complete HDO to form cyclohexane, which incidentally we could not analyse as same is used as a reaction media. In order to check this possibility, the stability study of cyclohexanol was carried out at 225 °C under N2 and H2 atmospheres under similar reaction conditions. The result showed that under N2 atmosphere cyclohexanol was more stable with 20% conversion compared to under H2 atmosphere wherein 50% conversion of cyclohexanol was seen (Figure S7, ESI). Incidentally, as mentioned above, quantification of cyclohexane as product was not possible since reactions were carried out in the same solvent. However, stability study results imply that under the reaction conditions employed in this study, cyclohexanol is unstable and converted into deoxygenated product cyclohexane or coke. Further, to investigate the loss in carbon balance at higher reaction temperature, spent Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst was subjected to the elemental analysis and TGA analysis (Table S5, ESI and Figure S8, ESI). The calculated weight loss at 225 °C was 9.4% (TGA, difference in weight loss between spent and fresh catalyst at 800 °C) which reflects into loss of 0.046 g of substrate or product. Further, based on the mass balance (89% GC based), loss of substrate was calculated to be 0.055 g. Thus it is suggested that lower mass balance is due to strongly adsorbed substrate or product on the catalyst surface or coke formation. However, the first possibility is negligible because it can happen at lower temperature too like at 200 °C but where higher mass balance was achieved (99%). Surprisingly, at higher reaction temperature of 250 °C, calculated weight loss was 6.3% based on TGA study. The similar trend was also observed from CHNS elemental analysis. As summarized in Table S5 (ESI), in fresh Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst, no carbon was present. But, over Ru/Al2O3-Acidic @200 spent catalyst, 1.20% carbon and on Ru/Al2O3-Acidic @225 spent catalyst, the content of carbon was 5.35%. This shows that with an increase in reaction temperature, either coke formation or adsorption of reactant/products on the catalyst surface is possible. Moreover, with an increase in reaction temperature to 250 °C, decrease in carbon content (3.67%) was observed. From this it is concluded that in the temperature range of 200–225 °C, the formation of partial oxygenated products was predominant and those were adsorbed on the acidic support and can further be converted into carbonaceous deposits. There is a possibility that once carbon (either in coke or intermediate oxygenated products form) is deposited on the catalyst, active sites are buried under it and thus adsorption of reactant and/or intermediate products is prohibited on these active sites. This may result in the lower yield of desired products. The TGA and elemental analysis data are complimentary with each other and this proves that with an increase in temperature from 175 to 225 °C, adsorption of oxygenated products or coke on the catalyst surface increases. Now to investigate further on whether coke is deposited on the catalyst surface or oxygenated intermediate products, it is essential to delve deeper into the elemental and TGA results. A simple calculation of elemental analysis suggests that if cyclohexanol (C6H12O) is considered as a product adsorbed on the catalyst surface then with the consideration of carbon content (5.35%, spent catalyst @225 °C from elemental analysis), 1.18% of oxygen (5.35 × 16/72) is present on the catalyst. Additionally, 0.89% of H will be present (5.35 × 12/72). However, from elemental analysis we understand that only 0.62% H is calculated. The total for cyclohexanol adsorption should give 7.44% weight loss (5.35 + 1.18 + 0.89 = 7.42%). Yet, TGA analysis of spent catalyst @225 °C, showed 9.4% weight loss. Along with this, there is a mismatch between hydrogen present on catalyst, experimentally (0.62%, elemental analysis) and theoretically should be present from cyclohexanol adsorption (0.89%). Considering this, it is expected that partially, oxygenates and coke are deposited on the catalyst. 3.2.3 Effect of S/C (substrate to Ru catalyst) molar ratio To achieve the best results with lower Ru content, molar ratio of substrate to Ru was varied from 165 to 500 and the results are summarized in Fig. 3 . With highest S/C molar ratio of 500, 72% conversion with 42% yield of cyclohexanol and 23% yield of trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol was achieved. Reaction with S/C molar ratio of 325 showed 100% conversion of guaiacol with 54% yield of cyclohexanol and 24% yield of trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol. Subsequently, ratio of 220 was used and 100% conversion with 72% yield of cyclohexanol and 21% yield of trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol was observed. Further, decrease in the S/C molar ratio to 165, 78% yield of cyclohexanol with 12% yield of trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol was achieved. This shows that with a deficiency of the catalyst or active sites (Ru), side reactions are predominant. Interesting observation is that reaction carried out without catalyst showed no conversion, which means that guaiacol is thermally stable compound at 225 °C. But it eventually suggests that in the absence of Ru, Al2O3 itself can catalyse guaiacol conversion however, to undesired products (which could not be detected on GC/GCMS). With decrease in ratio, improvement in overall mass balance was seen which means that with presence of Ru active sites, mass balance improves and also conversion of guaiacol and intermediate, trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol to cyclohexanol enhances. Later with lower ratio of 220 reaction was carried out for 8 h and slightly lower yield of cyclohexanol (65%) and trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol (19%) was observed as compare to 4 h reaction with similar ratio. This might be because of two reasons, 1) due to conversion of cyclohexanol to cyclohexane over Ru or 2) contribution of Al2O3 to yield side products from intermediate or cyclohexanol due to lack of Ru active sites. To ascertain this fact, reaction with only Al2O3 was carried (225 °C, 4 h, 1 MPa H2) out and found that cyclohexanol is stable under reaction condition. TGA (Figure S10, ESI) and elemental analysis (C, 3.99%; H, 0.57%) of Al2O3 suggested very low adsorption of cyclohexanol on the surface. 3.2.4 Effect of time on hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol As shown above with S/C molar ratio of 165, within 4 h, it was possible to achieve 77% yield for cyclohexanol with complete conversion of guaiacol at 225 °C. As complete conversion of guaiacol was possible within 4 h and as per our earlier observation that cyclohexanol is unstable at 225 °C, reactions with shorter time was carried out (Fig. 4 ). It was observed that within 2 h of reaction, mass balance was improved but cyclohexanol formation was decreased to 65% compared to 77% observed within 4 h. Additionally, as expected, intermediate formation was increased to 30% from 12%. The improvement in the mass balance reflects the fact that shorter reaction times are better to supress side reactions of cyclohexanol. Later, to check whether cyclohexanol yield can improve with further conversion of intermediate, reaction was carried out for 6 h. It was expected that with longer reaction time, trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol will convert into cyclohexanol and on the same line decrease in the yield of intermediate was seen (9%) compared to 4 h (12%). However, this decrease in the intermediate concentration did not reflect in the formation of cyclohexanol as lower yield of it was observed (73%) compared to 4 h reaction (77%). From the time study, it was observed that the first step in this reaction is formation of cis and trans-2-methoxycyclohexanols which further gets converted in to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone by the cleavage of C–O bond. Hence it is believed that reaction proceeds via cyclohexanone species which further undergoes hydrogenation to yield cyclohexanol. From this, it is proposed that on the catalyst surface ring hydrogenation of guaiacol occurs to form cis and trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol, however the trans form is more stable than cis form hence the trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol was observed in reaction and cis-methoxycyclohexanol immediately gets converted to cyclohexanol due to its low stability. To prove this, we have carried out reactions with either guaiacol or trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol as substrate under similar conditions (1 h). It was seen that guaiacol conversion was 39% with 22% of cyclohexanol formation. On the other hand, when reaction was done with trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol, 26% conversion was seen with the 11% formation of cyclohexanol. In the later reaction, formation of cis isomer was also seen (Figure S11, ESI). This shows that conversion of guaiacol to cyclohexanol was faster, which may happen through cis isomer formation, which is less stable than trans isomer. When trans-2-methoxy cyclohexanol was used as a substrate, from GC and GCMS profiles it was observed that trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol was converted to a compound for which peak appears at RT = 3.74, which is in a very close proximity to the trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol peak (RT = 3.87). The mass fragmentation pattern of both the peaks is very similar. In view of this, we are assuming that these peaks are for cis and trans isomers. It is natural that trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol will be more stable than cis-2-methoxycyclohexanol due to increased steric interaction of groups in cis isomer compared to trans isomer of same, which has less exothermic heat of combustion.Thermodynamically trans form of disubstituted cyclic hydrocarbon is more stable than cis form. Hence we believe that cis-2-methoxycyclohexanol is an intermediate for final product cyclohexanol. 3.2.5 Effect of H2 pressure Typically, literature reports HDO reactions under high H2 pressure (>3 MPa) [13,20,23] however, in this work it is shown that HDO can be achieved even at 1 MPa pressure with high yield of cyclohexanol (82%). In order to check whether Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst could show consistent HDO activity further under lower H2 pressures, reactions were carried out using 0.5 MPa H2 pressure and the results are summarized in Fig. 5 . However, at lower pressure, conversion of guaiacol was decreased to 40% with only 10% cyclohexanol and 20% trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol formation. This result is very poor compared with 1 MPa pressure reaction (guaiacol conversion, 100%; cyclohexanol yield, 77% and trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol yield, 12%). The better activity observed at 1 MPa may be attributed to two factors, 1) increased solubility of H2 in cyclohexane, which in turn gives more concentration of H2 on the catalyst and 2) Better interaction between substrate (solubilized) and catalyst (solid). To check these possibilities, reaction was carried out with 0.3 MPa partial pressure of H2 + 0.7 MPa partial pressure of N2 (total 1 MPa pressure). Under this reaction condition, the conversion of guaiacol was only 15% with 7% cyclohexanol and 2% trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol formation. This suggests that even if total pressure of 1 MPa is applied with lower partial pressure of hydrogen, reaction does not proceed and in turn it leads to the conclusion that availability of hydrogen on the catalyst is more important than increase in interaction between catalyst and substrate due to higher pressures. Further, in order to study the effect of higher H2 pressure, reaction was carried out at 1.5 MPa H2 and 100% conversion of guaiacol was obtained but the yields of both, cyclohexanol (67%) and trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol (7%) were decreased. The possible reason behind this could be the excess availability of H2 resulted in the formation of the complete deoxygenated product i.e cyclohexane, which as mentioned earlier we could not detect due to same is used as a reaction media. The hydrogen solubility study [46] reveals that in all the organic solvents like methylstyrene, cumene, cyclohexene, and cyclohexane; solubility of hydrogen increases with increase in temperature (30 °C–100 °C) and pressure (0.68 MPa to 6.89 MPa). Interestingly, maximum hydrogen solubility was observed in cyclohexane as a solvent. In yet another study, solubility of hydrogen in organic solvents such benzene, cyclohexane, decaline, phenol, and cyclohexanol was checked and it was found that cyclohexanol had the second highest hydrogen solubility after decaline at atmospheric pressure between 25–150 °C [47]. 3.2.6 Effect of solvent Since, lignin depolymerization reactions are typically carried out in alcohol-water mixture, [14–17] it was decided to carry out HDO reactions in the presence of MeOH:H2O (5:1 v/v). Although, this solvent system is good for depolymerization reaction but it unfortunately did not yield good HDO activity (Fig. 6 ). This might be because of competition between guaiacol, methanol and water to interact with catalyst surface. Water (29.27 Å2) and guaiacol (29.46 Å2), have almost similar Molecular Polar Surface Area (PSA), i.e., surface belonging to polar atoms, which is higher compared to methanol (20.23 Å2) and this might play role in the interaction with catalyst surface. Al2O3 is predominantly considered as polar material with some ionic character to Al-O bond due to Al being electropositive and O being electronegative. Even though, water and guaiacol can interact with Al2O3 almost with a similar extent however, difference in concentration of those in the reaction system reduces the extent of interaction of guaiacol (4 mmol) with Al2O3 surface in comparison to water (227 mmol). This less interaction with catalyst surface of guaiacol in turn can lower its interaction with active sites and thus, reaction did not progress. Moreover, oxygenated solvents (polar solvents) may interact with catalyst surface and thus devoid any interaction of guaiacol with catalyst surface. When reaction was carried out in presence of hexane (PSA, 0.00 Å2 due to absence of surface ‘O’ atoms), conversion of guaiacol reached to 85% with the formation of 17% cyclohexane along with 34% cyclohexanol and 8% trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol (69% carbon balance). However, when the reaction was carried out in the presence of cyclohexane (PSA, 0.00 Å2 due to absence of surface ‘O’ atoms), complete conversion of guaiacol was achieved along with 77% yield of cyclohexanol and 12% yield of trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol. As seen, non-oxygenated (non-polar) solvents may not interfere with the interaction of guaiacol with catalyst surface and thus can enhance the activity of a catalyst. The decrease in the activity of a catalyst in presence of hexane could be due to deactivation of catalyst by the adsorption of coke on the catalyst surface as in this solvent, either cyclohexanol was further converted into cyclohexane and then into coke or hexane itself is converted to coke. To check this, reaction was carried out under similar reaction condition (225 °C, 4 h) in absence of substrate (guaiacol) in both, cyclohexane and hexane solvents and the spent catalysts were subjected to elemental analysis (Table S6, ESI). As seen, almost double the quantity of carbon was deposited on the catalyst used in hexane solvent compared to cyclohexane. Moreover, lower carbon balance observed using hexane as a solvent, implies that it might not be a good solvent to carry out reactions. Another interesting fact was seen about the extent of adsorption of guaiacol on the catalyst surface in different solvents. With polar solvent such as water + methanol mixture, guaiacol adsorption on catalytic surface was negligible but with nonpolar solvent such as cyclohexane and hexane, it was 52% and 46%, respectively (Figure S12, ESI). This is obvious because as discussed above, due to difference in PSA of water and non-polar solvents, interaction of guaiacol with catalyst surface is lower. 3.2.7 Effect of reduction temperature of catalyst on the catalytic activity Typically, metal catalysts are reduced at higher temperatures (>300 °C) in order to achieve complete reduction of metal. In view of this, initially Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst was reduced at 400 °C and the activity of the catalyst was evaluated at 225 °C for 4 h under 1 MPa H2 in hexane solvent (Fig. 7 ). Although, 50% conversion of guaiacol was observed but no formation of cyclohexanol or trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol was seen. But in this reaction, 11% yield of cyclohexane was obtained (hexane was used as a solvent). To understand whether at lower reduction temperatures, activity increases, catalyst was reduced at 250 °C and 150 °C and with decrease in reduction temperature, higher activity of the catalyst was seen (Fig. 7). The same trend of dependence of catalytic activity as a function of reduction temperature was observed with cyclohexane as a reaction solvent (Fig. 8 ). With cyclohexane as solvent complete conversion of guaiacol was achieved with all the catalysts. In presence of Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst, the yield of cyclohexanol reached up to 77% with 12% yield of trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol. The catalyst reduced at 150 °C showed almost similar activity (76% cyclohexanol and 9% trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol yield) as that with non-reduced catalyst. However, the activity of catalyst drastically reduced with increase in the reduction temperature to 250 °C (48% cyclohexanol yield and 8% trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol yield) and 400 °C (cyclohexanol yield, 25%). This proves that with an increase in reduction temperature, interaction of substrate with active catalyst site is either reduced. [48,49] The other plausible explanation is want of higher oxidation state metal in this reaction. However, this aspect needs further probe to be done. To understand whether with an increase in reduction temperature crystallite size of Ru has increased which in turn has reduced the concentration of active sites for the reaction, CO chemisorption analysis was performed and the results are summarized in Table S7 (ESI). However, almost similar crystallite size was seen for all the catalysts, which then emphasize the fact that besides particle size, some other factor is playing a role in deciding the catalyst activity. To study this further, elemental analysis of catalysts was done and the results are summarized in Table S8 (ESI). As seen, with an increase in the catalyst reduction temperature, higher amount of carbon was deposited on the catalyst surface which suggests that in the initial time, activity of the catalyst may actually increase for the catalysts reduced at higher temperatures however, later coke formation may happen, that would bury the active sites and thus lower the conversion and yields for desired products. Similarly, all the catalyst with different reduction temperature were used in the presence of cyclohexane solvent and the results are shown in Fig. 8. 3.2.8 HDO of different substrate Since Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst was active in guaiacol conversion into cyclohexanol, it was worth evaluating catalysts HDO performance with other lignin derived substrates like phenol, veratrole, anisole, and eugenol. Reactions with these substrates were carried out under similar reaction condition that was used for guaiacol. In all the reactions, complete conversion of substrate was achieved. With phenol as a substrate, (Figures S13, ESI) yield of cyclohexanol was 20% with the formation of pentane, cyclopentane as other products. There is a possibility of formation of cyclohexane in reaction mixture which could not be quantified due to similar reaction medium. Reaction with veratrole (Figures S14, ESI) showed 20% cyclohexanol and 9% trans-2-methoxycyclohexanol formation along with observance of dimethoxy cyclohexanol. HDO of anisole (Figures S15, ESI) gave 22% cyclohexanol and 15% methoxycyclohexane formation and in HDO of eugenol (Figures S16, ESI), 27% propyl cyclohexanol (2-propylcyclohexan-1-ol) yield was obtained. As can be seen from the GC and GCMS profiles of all these reactions various ring hydrogenated and partial hydrogenated products could be identified however, few of those could not be quantified due to lack of commercial samples. 3.2.9 Recycle study of catalyst The reusability of Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst was done by carrying out multiple catalytic runs with spent catalyst. During the recycle study the recovery of spent catalyst was done by centrifugation. The recovered wet catalyst was used in the next catalytic run without any pre-treatment. In addition, to check the catalyst activity by maintaining S/C ratio constant, the recovered wet catalyst obtained after 3rd catalytic run was dried at 60 °C for 12 h and used for 4th run. Recycle study shown in Fig. 9 represents drop in the catalyst activity till 3rd run this was due to increase in substrate to catalyst ratio due to loss of catalyst during recovery of spent catalyst. Hence in fourth run S/C ratio was maintained which showed improvement in the activity of catalyst correlating with the result of 1st catalytic run. This shows that catalyst is stable under reaction condition and reusable till 4th run. 4 Characterization of spent catalyst The N2 sorption data of spent Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst shows slight decrease in the surface area of spent catalyst (114 m2 g−1). This is due to adsorption of coke on the catalyst surface as is proven above. ICP-OES analysis shows no leaching of Ru metal as the Ru content in fresh and spent was same. CO chemisorption data also showed similar crystallite size of fresh and spent catalyst (1.8 nm) with 72% dispersion. The TPR profile of fresh and spent catalyst were exactly matching with each other as shown in (Figure S17, ESI). TEM profile shows similar morphology of spent catalyst (Figure S18, ESI). Due to the stability of the catalyst, it showed similar activity in recycle runs. 5 Conclusion Hydrodeoxygenation reactions of guaiacol and various other lignin derived monomers were carried out in presence of different Ru based supported metal catalyst. Effect of support study shows that acidic support plays an important role in the improvement of catalyst activity towards HDO reaction. A unique study on the effect of reduction temperature of catalyst shows that with decrease in reduction temperature activity of catalyst increases due to metal is partially present in higher oxidation state that helps in suppressing coke formation. In cyclohexane medium in presence of Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst, 82% yield of cyclohexanol was achieved with 100% conversion of guaiacol, which is one of the highest reported until now. The recycle study of catalyst shows that catalyst is stable under reaction condition.

        "dc:description": "Up-gradation of lignin derived monomers to value-added and fuel grade products is important to make overall bio-refinery process economical. Although, few studies are devoted on this work yet, systematic study on commercially viable (low loading of metal, recyclable catalyst, mild conditions, high selectivities etc.) is scarce and typically done under harsh conditions. Herein, we report, the methodical effect of support (SiO2, Al2O3 (acidic, basic and neutral), SiO2-Al2O3) on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignin derived various monomers, guaiacol, veretrol, eugenol, phenol using very low loading (0.5 wt%) Ru catalyst. Very high yield (82%) of cyclohexanol from guaiacol could be achieved in presence of cyclohexane as a solvent and Ru/Al2O3-Acidic catalyst at 225 °C and under 1 MPa H2 pressure. The detailed study on the effect of solvent, stability and adsorption of reactant & products etc. is done and it was observed that products are more prone to adsorb and undergo further reactions. The complete characterization of fresh and spent catalysts revealed that lower catalyst reduction temperature and presence of Ru in partially higher oxidation state proved by XPS, helps in enhancing the cyclohexanol formation. Subsequently, role of Ru particle size and support on the activity was also investigated.",
