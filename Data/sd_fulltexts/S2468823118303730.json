Graphical abstract The high catalytic activity of CO2 conversion to carbonate on a Cu-MOF observed experimentally is elucidated from DFT calculations. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as unique catalysts for CO2 conversion, but the catalytic mechanism remains elusive. In this study, a density functional theory (DFT) study is reported on CO2 cycloaddition with propylene oxide (PO) to produce propylene carbonate (PC), catalyzed by a Cu-MOF (NTU-180) in the presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB). This reaction was experimentally observed to have a remarkably high efficiency. We compute the electronic and Gibbs energies of the reactants, intermediates, transition states and products for two alternative reaction pathways. On NTU-180/TBAB, the three-member ring opening of PO is revealed to possess a higher activation barrier than the five-member ring closure of PC, and thus it is the rate-determining step. Pathway I is kinetically more favorable as its ring opening has a lower barrier than in Pathway II. Moreover, the activation barriers of ring opening and ring closure steps on NTU-180/TBAB are substantially lower than those in the gas phase, and also lower than those on TBAB alone and on a Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB complex. At a molecular level, these results unambiguously highlight the important roles of the Cu sites and the confinement effect of NTU-180 in enhancing the stabilities of reaction intermediates and transition states, and promoting the catalytic cycloaddition of CO2 with PO. In addition, the sensitivities of the DFT calculation results to the choice of functional and basis set are critically analyzed. While the electronic and Gibbs energies vary substantially with functional, the activation barriers in the rate-determining step are affected only slightly by the functional and marginally by the basis set. This theoretical study provides microscopic and quantitative insights into the high catalytic activity observed experimentally for CO2 cycloaddition on NTU-180/TBAB, and might facilitate the development of new catalysts for efficient CO2 conversion. Keywords CO2 cycloaddition Metal-organic framework Density functional theory Catalytic activity 1 Introduction CO2 is an abundant and nontoxic source of the C1 building block, but it is also considered to be largely responsible for increasingly severe global warming. As a consequence, there is considerable interest in CO2 conversion into high value-added chemicals for sustainable development and environmental protection [1]. For example, CO2 cycloaddition with epoxides to cyclic carbonates (Scheme 1 ) has nearly 100% efficiency and represents an intriguing route for CO2 conversion [2]. Cyclic carbonates are commonly used as raw materials for producing plastics, aprotic polar solvents and electrolytes in lithium batteries, as well as intermediates for pharmaceuticals [3]. This conversion can be catalyzed by various homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts such as alkali metal halides [4], ionic liquids [5], polymers [6], zeolites [7,8] and transition-metal complexes [9,10]. However, these catalysts suffer from several drawbacks, such as low reactivity/stability, requiring high pressure and/or temperature, using toxic polar solvents, etc [11,12]. Therefore, the development of efficient and green catalysts is highly desirable. Over the last two decades, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a special class of nanoporous materials [13]. With their large surface areas, tunable pore sizes, high capacities for CO2 adsorption, and high densities of metal sites, MOFs are envisioned as promising catalysts or catalyst supports for CO2 conversion under mild conditions [14–16]. A variety of MOFs such as Zn-MOF-5 [17], MIL-101(Cr) [18], Co-MOF-74 [19], Cu-MOF-505 [20], Co-PCN-224 [21] and Cr-MOF [22] have been examined for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides. In particular, a Cu-MOF (named as NTU-180) consisting of Cu2 paddle-wheel units and nitrogen-rich triazole groups was found to be remarkably efficient [23]. With the presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) as a co-catalyst on NTU-180, a 96% yield of propylene carbonate was obtained from the cycloaddition of CO2 with propylene oxide (PO) at ambient temperature. The high catalytic activity was ascribed, without theoretical evidence, as being due to the exposed Lewis-acid Cu sites and the confinement effect in NTU-180 [23]. The generally accepted mechanism for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides on TBAB is illustrated in Scheme S1 (Supporting Information). First, the ring of the epoxide is opened through a nucleophilic attack by a bromide ion (Br−), then an oxy-anion species is formed, and finally a cyclic carbonate is produced after a ring closure step [24]. Although a plausible mechanism for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides catalyzed by MOFs was proposed in experimental studies, [18,20] the detailed underlying mechanism is still ambiguous and under debate. In the present work, we report a density functional theory (DFT) study of the cycloaddition of CO2 with PO on NTU-180 with TBAB as a co-catalyst [23]. In order to unravel the roles of the Cu sites and any confinement effects of the NTU-180 framework, we also systematically examine the cycloaddition in the gas phase, on TBAB, and on a Cu2 paddle-wheel with TBAB, respectively. We show that the high catalytic activity experimentally observed on NTU-180/TBAB can be quantitatively elucidated at the molecular level. It should be noted that DFT has been used to explore catalytic mechanisms for different reactions on MOFs. For instance, Van Speybroeck and coworkers adopted the PBE functional and parodic models to examine the effect of Lewis acid sites on Knoevenagel condensation and Michael addition on MOF-74 [25]. With the M06-L functional, Limtrakul and coworkers studied a Mukaiyama aldol reaction on Cu-MOF-505 and Cu-ZSM-5 [26]. They further conducted a mechanistic study of ethylene epoxidation on Fe-BTC using the M06-L functional with various basis sets [27]. Gagliardi and coworkers screened possible transition metals supported on NU-1000 and UiO-66 for alcohol dehydrogenation, and excellent results were obtained from the M06-L functional with medium-range electron correlation effect [28,29]. Snurr and coworkers examined the hydrolysis of a chemical warfare agent (methylparaoxon) on Zr-based NU-1000 by using the B3LYP functional for geometry optimizations and the DFT-D3 for single-point energy calculations; additionally, they also tested the performance of the M06 functional, the second-order MøllerPlesset theory (MP2), and the Hartree-Fock method (HF) [30]. For aldehyde cyanosilylation on MIL-101(Cr), De Abreu and coworkers examined the electronic energy variation by the PBE functional and various basis sets, and the difference in electronic energy among the basis sets was found to be around 2 kcal/mol [31]. Following this introduction, the models and methods used in the current study are briefly described in Section 2. In Section 3, we first present the theoretical results for the cycloaddition mechanism in the gas phase. Then, two competitive reaction pathways are discussed separately on TBAB, NTU-180/TBAB and Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB. By comparing the activation barriers as well as the relative Gibbs energies of the intermediates and transition states, the respective roles of the Cu sites and the confinement effect of Cu-MOF are quantitatively evaluated. Finally, the sensitivities to the choices of functional and basis set are examined. Section 4 contains a summary and some concluding remarks. 2 Models and methods First, it is important to determine the multiplicity and spin state of the Cu dimer in NTU-180. A Cu2 paddle-wheel (Fig. S1) was used to calculate the electronic energies for different possible multiplicities. The B3LYP functional was used along with 6–31 G(d) basis set for the main-group atoms and LanL2DZ for Cu atoms. As listed in Table S1, the electronic energy is the lowest with a multiplicity of 3. This suggests that the Cu2 dimer in the paddle-wheel has a triplet spin state, in line with the result reported by Yadnum et al [26]. In its crystal structure, NTU-180 consists of two types of channels with diameters of 7.9 and 12.6 Å, respectively [23]. For the cycloaddition of CO2 with PO on NTU-180/TBAB, the large channels can accommodate CO2, PO, TBAB, as well as carbonate. Thus, these channels play an important role in catalytic performance and it is important to incorporate their confinement effect into calculations. To do so, a cluster model with six Cu2 paddle-wheel units and twenty-four ligands (in total 802 atoms) was cut from the experimental crystal structure. The dangling bonds in the cluster were saturated by H atoms. In order to reduce computational cost, a two-layer ONIOM (our own n-layered integrated molecular orbital and molecular mechanics) method was adopted [32]. The inner layer included a Cu2 paddle-wheel unit and four benzene rings (52 atoms), and the remainder was the outer layer fixed at the crystal positions (Fig. 1 a). The co-catalyst TBAB, intermediates and transition states were in the inner layer and treated quantum mechanically (Fig. 1b). To compare with the performance on NTU-180/TBAB, the cycloaddition was also examined in the gas phase, on TBAB alone and on the Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB, respectively. For all these four systems (gas phase, on TBAB, NTU-180/TBAB and Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB), geometry optimizations were performed with the B3LYP functional [33]. It should be noted that the B3LYP functional is a widely used exchange–correlation functional, well-suited for geometry optimization [34,35]. The main-group atoms were described by the 6–31 G(d) basis set [36] with the LanL2DZ basis set [37] for the Cu atoms. For the outer layer on NTU-180/TBAB, the atoms were fixed and treated by the Universal force field (UFF) [38], and the atomic charges were estimated by the charge equilibration method [39]. The energy minima and transition states were verified by frequency calculations at the same level as the geometry optimizations. As listed in Table S2, only one imaginary frequency was found for each optimized transition state. Furthermore, the transition states were confirmed to connect with the reactants and products by the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) approach [40]. The electronic energies (E ele) of the reactants, intermediates, transition states and products were computed with ONIOM(M06-L/6-311++G(2df,2p):UFF). It is important to note that the M06-L functional [41] has been commonly adopted for theoretically investigations of catalytic reactions on MOFs [26–29]. Taking the isolated reactants and catalysts as a reference, the relative Gibbs energies of the intermediates, transition states and products were estimated at 298 K (1) ΔG = ΔE ele + ΔG therm where ΔE ele is the difference in electronic energies, while ΔG therm is the thermal correction at 298 K and 1 bar estimated with the same method and basis set used for optimization. To examine how the theoretical results depend on the functional and basis set used, the electronic energies of the intermediates and transition states on NTU-180/TBAB were further computed. The inner layer was treated with the functionals M06-L, PBE [42] and B3LYP-D3 [43], respectively, using the 6-311++G (2df,2p) basis set [44], while the outer layer was mimicked by the UFF force field. Moreover, the computations were conducted for two rate-determining steps with the M06-L functional and three different basis sets for the inner layer: (1) 6-311++G(2df,2p) for all the atoms; (2) 6-311++G(2df,2p) for the main-group atoms and LanL2DZ for the Cu atoms, and (3) 6-311++G(2df,2p) for the main-group atoms and Def2TZVPP [45] for the Cu atoms. All the computations were performed using the Gaussian 09 software [46]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 In the gas phase It is known that the non-substituted carbon in PO is prone to nucleophilic attack [47]. Thus, the cycloaddition of the Lewis acid CO2 with the Lewis base PO in the gas phase is considered to be a single step. Fig. 2 shows the relative Gibbs energies of intermediate (Int), transition state (TS) and product (Pro), as well as their optimized geometries. The relevant electronic energies and thermal corrections are listed in Table S3. Initially, a co-adsorption complex (Int) is formed between CO2 and PO with a C···O distance of 2.83 Å. The complex has a relative electronic energy of ‒3.5 kcal/mol (Fig. S2), but by adding the thermal correction, its relative Gibbs energy becomes 3.6 kcal/mol. This underlines the importance of incorporating the thermal correction. After rearrangement, the complex transforms to a transition state (TS) with a shorter C···O distance of 1.67 Å. The imaginary frequency associated with the TS is ‒508.05i cm−1 (Table S2) and can be attributed to the breaking of the C–O bond in PO and the forming of two new C–O bonds. Eventually, a cyclic carbonate is produced. As listed in Table 1 , this reaction is endothermic by 2.5 kcal/mol and needs to overcome an activation barrier of 62.6 kcal/mol. The barrier is close to the values reported in the literature (55.3 and 63 kcal/mol depending on the calculation method) [48]. The high barrier suggests that the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 with PO in the gas phase is likely to occur at a high temperature. 3.2 On TBAB TBAB provides a nucleophilic reagent, Br−, for the cycloaddition of CO2 with PO. In this case, two competitive pathways are illustrated in Scheme 2 . Pathway I includes three steps: the opening of the three-member ring in PO, the insertion of CO2, and the closure of the five-member ring to form a cyclic carbonate. Pathway II involves only two steps: the ring opening after the formation of a trimolecular complex by PO, CO2 and TBAB, then the ring closure as in Pathway I. In each pathway, the rate-determining step and the role of TBAB are examined. Figs. 3 and 4 show the relative Gibbs energies and optimized geometries of intermediates and transition states, respectively. The electronic energies and thermal corrections are listed in Table S4. In Pathway I, PO initially interacts with TBAB to form a co-adsorption complex (A), which has a relative Gibbs energy of 1.9 kcal/mol and H···O distances of 2.48 and 2.50 Å. As a nucleophilic reagent, the Br− ion attacks the non-substituted carbon atom in PO, and the three-member ring is opened leading to an oxy-anion intermediate (B). B is absorbed on the TBAB cation with a short H···O distance of 1.90 Å and a relative Gibbs energy of 17.7 kcal/mol. There is a transition state, TS-AB, from A to B with C–O, C–Br and H⋯O distances of 1.81, 2.60 and 2.02 Å, respectively. The imaginary frequency of TS–AB is –406.78i cm−1 (Table S2), which corresponds to the breaking of the C–O bond and the formation of the C–Br bond. The activation barrier for the ring opening is 28.2 kcal/mol. In the literature, the barrier ranges from 27.7 to 39 kcal/mol, depending on the catalyst and calculation method [49,50]. Subsequently, CO2 is inserted into B to form a carbonate anion intermediate (C) with a relative Gibbs energy of 13.1 kcal/mol and short H···O distances of 1.97 and 2.10 Å. No transition state exists during CO2 insertion from B to C, as evidenced by Fig. S3 in which the system energy changes monotonically by scanning the C–O bond of C. Finally, C is transformed to carbonate (D) through the five-member ring closure via transition state TS-CD. The TS-CD has C–O and Br–C bond distances of 1.88 Å and 2.54 Å, respectively. The imaginary frequency of TS-CD is ‒410.06i cm-1 (Table S2), referring to the movement along the reaction coordinate by which a new O–C bond is formed. The product D has a low relative Gibbs energy of –3.4 kcal/mol, and it interacts with TBAB with H⋯O distances of 2.49 Å and 2.53 Å. The activation barrier for the five-member ring closure is 15.1 kcal/mol, which is nearly half of the barrier for the three-member ring opening (28.2 kcal/mol). Moreover, the ring closure is exothermic (–16.5 kcal/mol). Clearly, the ring opening has a higher barrier than ring closure, thus it is the rate-determining step in Pathway I. In Pathway II, a trimolecular complex (A + CO2) is firstly formed from PO, CO2 and TBAB with a C···O distance of 2.75 Å (Fig. 4). This complex has a slightly higher relative Gibbs energy of 3.9 kcal/mol than that in A. Thereafter, PO is attacked by Br− ion and simultaneously activated by CO2, leading to the concerted ring opening (C). The transition state TS-AC has C–O, Br–C and H⋯O distances of 1.75 Å, 2.77 Å and 2.32 Å, respectively (Fig. 4). The imaginary frequency of TS-AC is ‒437.81i cm−1 (Table S2), due to the breaking of a C–O bond and the formation of a new O–C bond. The ring-opening step is endothermic by 9.2 kcal/mol and possesses an activation barrier of 34.4 kcal/mol. The final step is the five-member ring closure, which is the same as in Pathway I, with a barrier of 15.1 kcal/mol. Obviously, the concerted ring opening is also the rate-determining step in Pathway II. For the two ring-opening steps, however, the barrier in Pathway I (28.2 kcal/mol) is lower than that in Pathway II (34.4 kcal/mol). Thus, the ring-opening step in Pathway I is kinetically more favored. As discussed earlier, the activation barrier in the gas phase is 62.6 kcal/mol. On TBAB, the barrier of the rate-determining step is reduced by nearly a half. Furthermore, all the intermediates and transition states are stabilized on TBAB through their short H···O distances. Therefore, TBAB reduces the activation barrier, stabilizes the intermediates and transition states, thus promoting CO2 cycloaddition with PO. 3.3 On NTU-180/TBAB The mechanisms of CO2 cycloaddition with PO catalyzed on NTU-180/TBAB are shown in Scheme 3 , which is similar to the competitive pathway on TBAB. However, the Cu atoms act as Lewis acid sites, in addition to the confinement effect of the NTU-180. Figs. 5 and 6 shows the relative Gibbs energies and optimized geometries of the intermediates and transition states, respectively. The electronic energies and thermal corrections are listed in Table S5. In Pathway I, PO is initially bound to a Cu atom to form an intermediate (A) with a O⋯Cu distance of 2.21 Å (Fig. 6). The relative Gibbs energy of A is –28.4 kcal/mol and much more negative than A in Fig. 3 (1.9 kcal/mol). This suggests that A is substantially stabilized in NTU-180 due to the confinement effect, as further discussed below. Under the electrophilic attack of Br−, the three-member ring of A is opened via a transition state, TS-AB, which has C–O, Br–C and O⋯Cu distances of 1.72, 2.80 and 2.15 Å, respectively. The imaginary frequency of TS-AB is ‒241.82i cm−1 (Table S2), as evidence for C–O bond breaking. The ring-opening step is endothermic by 20.4 kcal/mol and needs to overcome a barrier of 21.9 kcal/mol. After the ring opening, B is absorbed on the Cu atom with a O⋯Cu distance of 1.93 Å (Fig. 6) and a relative Gibbs energy of ‒8.0 kcal/mol. Subsequently, CO2 is inserted into B to form C. Similarly to the case on TBAB (Fig. 3), there is no transition state for this insertion, as evidenced in Fig. S4. Finally, the five-member ring is closed from C to product (D) with a transition state, TS-CD, which has C–O, Br–C and O⋯Cu distances of 2.28, 2.05 and 2.00 Å (Fig. 6), respectively. TS-CD is associated with an imaginary frequency at ‒399.45i cm-1, due to the formation of a new O–C bond. The O⋯Cu distance in D is 2.19 Å and the relative Gibbs energy is –21.7 kcal/mol. For the ring closure, the activation barrier is 14.6 kcal/mol, which is much lower than that for the ring opening (21.9 kcal/mol). It reveals that the ring opening is the rate-determining step in Pathway I on NTU-180/TBAB. In Pathway II, PO, CO2 and TBAB form a co-adsorption complex (A + CO2), which is coordinated onto a Cu atom with a O⋯Cu distance of 2.41 Å (Fig. 6). The complex has a relative Gibbs energy of –16.8 kcal/mol, which is lower than the similar complex on TBAB (Fig. 3); again, this is attributed to the confinement of NTU-180. Subsequently, PO undergoes an electrophilic attack by Br− and is meanwhile activated by CO2, resulting in the concerted ring opening (C) via the transition state TS-AC. The barrier is 31.4 kcal/mol and higher than 21.9 kcal/mol for the ring opening in Pathway I; thus, Pathway I is a kinetically more favorable process. The TS-AC has an imaginary frequency of ‒416.71i cm−1, and the C–O, Br–C bonds and O⋯Cu distances are 1.66, 2.74 and 2.20 Å (Fig. 6), respectively. It transforms into a carbonate anion intermediate (C). The final step is the ring closure to produce D with a barrier of 14.6 kcal/mol. 3.4 On Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB To evaluate the confinement effect of the copper-containing MOF, Figs. 7 and 8 show the relative Gibbs energies and optimized geometries of the intermediates and transition states on a Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB complex. The electronic energies and thermal corrections are listed in Table S6. From Figs. 3, 5 and 7, most of the intermediates and transition states on the Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB complex possess lower relative Gibbs energies than on TBAB, but higher than on NTU-180/TBAB. Therefore, from TBAB to Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB then to NTU-180/TBAB, the stabilities of the intermediates and transition states are enhanced by the Cu sites on paddle wheel and further enhanced by the confinement effect of the NTU-180 framework. The optimized geometries of most of the intermediates and transition states on the Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB are similar to those on NTU-180/TBAB. However, intermediate B has a slightly lower relative Gibbs energy on the Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB (‒10.0 kcal/mol) than on NTU-180 (‒8.0 kcal/mol). This is attributed to the structural deformation of intermediate B on the Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB. Specifically, the Cu–O bond length on the Cu2 paddle-wheel is 2.88 Å, which is longer than on NTU-180 (2.26 Å in Fig. 6). Similar deformation also occurs on the transition state TS-AB with a Cu–O bond distance of 2.33 Å. By contrast, the structural deformation is not obvious on NTU-180/TBAB also containing the Cu2 paddle-wheel, which is treated as the inner layer in the ONIOM model. Because the outer layer in the ONIOM model is fixed during optimization, thus the deformation of the inner layer (i.e., the Cu2 paddle-wheel on NTU-180/TBA) is insignificant. Due to such structural relaxation, as listed in Table 1, the ring opening in Pathway I via transition state TS-AB on the Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB has a much lower barrier (10.0 kcal/mol) than on NTU-180/TBAB (21.9 kcal/mol). Nevertheless, this ring opening is not the rate-determining step on the Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB; instead, the ring closure in Pathway I and the concerted ring opening in Pathway II are the rate-determining steps. For these two steps, their reaction barriers (22.6 and 36.5 kcal/mol) are higher than the corresponding steps on NTU-180/TBAB (14.6 and 31.4 kcal/mol). Therefore, the overall reaction barriers on NTU-180/TBAB are lower than on the Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB. In other words, the reaction is more favorable on NTU-180/TBAB due to the confinement effect. Table 1 summarizes the reaction barriers and energies for CO2 cycloaddition with PO in the gas phase, on TBAB alone, on NTU-180/TBAB and on Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB, respectively. In the gas phase, the barrier is 62.6 kcal/mol and the cycloaddition is likely to occur at high temperatures. On TBAB alone, the barrier is 28.2 kcal/mol in the rate-determining step of Pathway I and 34.4 kcal/mol in Pathway II. The barriers on TBAB are apparently reduced from that in the gas phase. On the Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB, the ring closure in Pathway I and the concerted ring opening in Pathway II are the rate-determining steps with barriers of 22.6 and 36.5 kcal/mol, respectively. The intermediates and transition states on Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB have higher stability than on TBAB alone. On NTU-180/TBAB, the barriers are 21.9 kcal/mol in Pathway I and 31.4 kcal/mol in Pathway II; these barriers are substantially lower than in the gas phase, and also lower than on TBAB and Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB. The reasons are attributed to (1) the Cu atoms in NTU-18 act as Lewis acid sites and facilitate the nucleophilic attack for ring opening; (2) the stabilities of intermediates and transition states are enhanced by the Cu atoms and the confinement of the framework. Consequently, NTU-180/TBAB has a higher catalytic activity than TBAB alone and Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB. On NTU-180/TBAB, the cycloaddition is like to occur at ambient temperature, as experimentally observed with high efficiency [23]. 3.5 Sensitivities of functional and basis set For the calculated results presented above, the electronic energies were calculated from the M06-L functional at 6-311++G(2df,2p) basis set. It is instructive to examine the sensitivities of the calculations to the choice of functional and basis set. Table S5 lists the electronic energies of the intermediates and transition states on NTU-180/TBAB from three functionals (M06-L, PBE and B3LYP-D3). The corresponding relative Gibbs enegies for both Pathway I and II are shown in Fig. S5 and found to be sensitive to functional. The M06-L predicts the relative Gibbs energies close to those from the PBE. Compared with the M06-L and PBE, the B3LYP-D3 overestimates the relative Gibbs energies. The reason for the Gibbs energy sensitive to the functional is that different sets of parameters and mathematics algorithms are used in various functionals. However, as the difference in the Gibbs energies between transition state and reactant, the activation barrier is relatively insensitive to the functional. As shown in Fig. 9 a, the barrier for the ring-opening step (i.e. the rate-determining step) ranges from 21.9 to 23.5 kcal/mol for Pathway I and from 24.9 to 31.4 kcal/mol for Pathway II. All three functionals consistently predict that Pathway I has a lower barrier than Pathway II and is kinetically more favorable. Based on the M06-L, the activitation barriers for the ring-opening step in the two pathways were further examined with three different basis sets (1) 6-311++G(2df,2p) for all the atoms (2) 6-311++G(2df,2p) for the main-group atoms and LanL2DZ for the Cu atoms; (3) 6-311++G(2df,2p) for the main-group atoms and Def2TZVPP for the Cu atoms. The electronic energies of the intermediates and transition states are listed in Table S7. Option (2) gives substantially different electronic energies from options (1) and (3). Nevertheless, the activation barriers are very close among the three options in both pathways. As shown in Fig. 9b, the difference is only 0.1 kcal/mol in Pathway I and 0.2 kcal/mol in Pathway II. This reveals that the activation barrier is insensitive to basis set. Furthermore, for all the three basis sets, Pathway I has a lower barrier than Pathway II and is more favorable. 4 Conclusions DFT calculations have been conducted to investigate the cycloaddition of CO2 with PO in the gas phase, on TBAB, on NTU-180/TBAB and on Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB. The results show that the activation barrier in the gas phase is high, thus the cycloaddition is likely to occur at a high temperature. On TBAB, the ring opening of PO is the rate-determining step in two alternative reaction pathways. The Br− ion acts as a nucleophilic reagent to reduce the activation barrier; meanwhile, the intermediates and transition states are stabilized by interacting with the cation. Consequently, the cycloaddition is promoted by TBAB. On the Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB, the ring closure in Pathway I and the concerted ring opening in Pathway II are the rate-determining steps. On NTU-180/TBAB, the cycloaddition has the lowest activation barrier, especially through Pathway I. The high catalytic activity on NTU-180/TBAB is attributed to two factors: firstly, the Cu sites facilitate ring opening in Pathway I and reduce the activation barrier; secondly, the confinement effect of the NTU-180 framework stabilizes the intermediates and transition states. The cycloaddition on NTU-180/TBAB is predicted to be the least energetically demanding and may occur at room temperature. These theoretical results confirm the hypothesis in experiment [23]. On the other hand, we should note the nitrogen-rich triazole groups may also play a role in the reaction and it would be interest to investigate their effect. Furthermore, the activation barriers are found to be only slightly affected by the choice of functional and insensitive to basis set. The molecular level insights from this theoretical study have enabled us to elucidate the underlying mechanism for CO2 cycloaddition with PO when catalyzed by NTU-180 in the presence of TBAB, and are useful for the rational design of new catalysts with high activity for CO2 conversion.

        "dc:description": "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as unique catalysts for CO2 conversion, but the catalytic mechanism remains elusive. In this study, a density functional theory (DFT) study is reported on CO2 cycloaddition with propylene oxide (PO) to produce propylene carbonate (PC), catalyzed by a Cu-MOF (NTU-180) in the presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB). This reaction was experimentally observed to have a remarkably high efficiency. We compute the electronic and Gibbs energies of the reactants, intermediates, transition states and products for two alternative reaction pathways. On NTU-180/TBAB, the three-member ring opening of PO is revealed to possess a higher activation barrier than the five-member ring closure of PC, and thus it is the rate-determining step. Pathway I is kinetically more favorable as its ring opening has a lower barrier than in Pathway II. Moreover, the activation barriers of ring opening and ring closure steps on NTU-180/TBAB are substantially lower than those in the gas phase, and also lower than those on TBAB alone and on a Cu2 paddle-wheel/TBAB complex. At a molecular level, these results unambiguously highlight the important roles of the Cu sites and the confinement effect of NTU-180 in enhancing the stabilities of reaction intermediates and transition states, and promoting the catalytic cycloaddition of CO2 with PO. In addition, the sensitivities of the DFT calculation results to the choice of functional and basis set are critically analyzed. While the electronic and Gibbs energies vary substantially with functional, the activation barriers in the rate-determining step are affected only slightly by the functional and marginally by the basis set. This theoretical study provides microscopic and quantitative insights into the high catalytic activity observed experimentally for CO2 cycloaddition on NTU-180/TBAB, and might facilitate the development of new catalysts for efficient CO2 conversion.",
