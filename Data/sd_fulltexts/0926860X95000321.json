Curie-Sklodowska Square, 20-031 Lublin, Poland Received 31 October 1994; revised 21 January 1995; accepted 26 January 1995 Abstract Nickel catalysts were prepared by double impregnation employing several organic reagents. The activity of the prepared catalysts was investigated in n-butane hydrogenolysis. The obtained results suggest that n-butane hydrogenolysis depends on the crystallite size of nickel. In the crystallite size range of 1.5-4.5 nm the reaction might proceed mainly through the parallel-consecutive mechanism. Keywords: Nickel/alumina catalysts; Impregnation (double); n-Butane; Hydrogenolysis 1. Introduction Supported metal catalysts have found wide application in many important industrial processes. Alumina supported nickel catalysts provide an example for various problems encountered when dealing with an active component dispersed on a support [ 1 ] . A number of studies reported supported contact preparations which allow the formation of small metal crystallites [ 1-5 ] . Most of these techniques, however, are quite complicated and seem to have few chances to be eventually employed on an industrial scale. It is possible to obtain small nickel crystallites by precipitation but such contacts, in turn, are hardly reducible [ 3,6 ] . The classical methods of impregnation of the carrier with solutions of the appropriate salts also yield small nickel crystallites but only at very low metal contents in the catalysts (below 2 wt.-%) [ 5 ] . * Corresponding author.

Our previous studies [ 7-17 ] concerned mainly the application of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in the preparation of alumina-supported nickel catalysts. These studies allowed us to conclude that this chelating agent was an appropriate reagent in the preparation of highly dispersed nickel catalysts. The aim of this work was to study the influence of organic impregnants on the physicochemical and catalytic properties of the catalysts obtained. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts Nickel catalysts were obtained by double impregnation [ 7,13 ] . The 0.8-1.02 mm fraction of y-A1203 from Pechiney St. Gobain (previously calcined at high temperatures; BET area=82.4 m2/g) was used as catalyst support. The preparation steps are given in Fig. 1.

Methods Total surface areas of the catalysts examined were determined from argon adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature by the BET method in a volumetric apparatus ensuring a vacuum of at least 10-5 mm Hg. The same apparatus was used for the determination of active surface areas of the reduced catalysts. The hydrogen adsorption was measured at room temperature, assuming the hydrogen binding stoichiometry to be 1:1 with a hydrogen atom taking an area of 6.5 A2. The amount of irreversibly adsorbed hydrogen was determined by the method described earlier [9]. The mean size of nickel crystallites was calculated from the equation: dNj=(5'103)/(SN,-8.9) [nm] (1) where SN; is the surface area of one gram of nickel in the catalyst (taking into account the degree of metal reduction) and 8.9 is the specific density of nickel, assuming that a nickel crystallite touches the carrier with one plane of the cubooctahedron. The reduction degree of the nickel catalysts studied was determined by the gravimetric method [ 18 ] . The measurement of the rate of n-butane hydrogenolysis was carried out in a gradientless reactor of our design [ 19] . All kinetic experiments were carried out in an atmosphere of hydrogen and n-butane in a molar ratio 6:1, determining isothermally the relationship between the reaction rate of n-butane and the degree of conversion of n-butane (iso-X). This way, the functions obtained r=f(X) at T= const. for several temperatures could serve as a basis for plotting the temperature dependence of the reaction rate at a constant degree of n-butane conversion X = const. [ 9,10 ] . The reaction rate measurements were taken for the temperature range 550-723 K. Reaction products were analyzed chromatographically on a `CHROM 5' gas chromatograph. The reaction rate was calculated from Eq. (2) , valid for gradientless reactors [20] r= (C2-F2- C, - Fj) /Gcat[mol/gca, h] (2) where r is the reaction rate, C, the initial concentration of products in mol dm-3, F, the initial volumetric rate in dm3 h-', CZ the final concentration of products in mol dm-3, F2 the final volumetric rate in dm3 h-' and Gca, the catalyst weight in g. The degree of n-butane conversion was calculated from the formulae: XCaHlo [(LC4Hio CC4Hio)/LC4Hio] X 100%[%O] (3) where CH,o is the initial concentration in mol dm-3 of n-butane and CC4H,o the outlet concentration in mol dm-3 of n-butane. 344 J. Ryczkowski et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 341-349 The yield of the reaction products (CH4, C2H6, C3Hg) was calculated from the following equation: S = ( (rCH4 or rcZHb or rC3H$) / (rcH4 + rc2H6 + rC3H8) ) X 100% [ % ] (4 ) where rCH4, rcZHb, rc3H$ are the reaction rates, respectively, for CH4, CZH6 and C3Hg. 3. Results Table 2 sets out the results obtained form adsorption measurements and other physicochemical properties of the catalysts examined. Changes in the impregnation parameters of the catalysts examined made it possible to obtain samples which differed greatly with respect to degree of nickel dispersion. Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the active surface area development of 1 g of Ni in the catalysts against the impregnation time in the nickel nitrate solution. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between the reaction rate of n-butane hydrogenolysis and mean nickel crystallites size in the catalysts. The reaction rate was calculated per 1 g of Ni and the active surface of nickel catalysts. This figure shows the changes in the reaction rate of n-butane hydrogenolysis at 650 K (degree of n-butane conversion Xc4H,o =10%) . It has been found that the reaction rate of n-butane hydrogenolysis depends on the degree of nickel dispersion passing trough a maximum at a nickel crystallite size of 1.5-4.5 nm [9,12]. The dependence of the n-butane hydrogenolysis distribution, in relation to all products obtained from this reaction, on the size of the nickel crystallites is presented in Fig. 4. This figure shows changes in the distribution of reaction products at 650 K (degree of n-butane conversion XCQH,o =10%) . 4. Discussion and conclusions 4.1. Preparation of the catalysts There is information that the features of the coordination chemistry for supported transition metal ions (TIMs) are very similar to those of their solution analogues and the same concepts can thus be applied [21,22]. During impregnation the total amount of solute will be fixed by the support in two ways, adsorption on the surface and from the solution in the liquid filling the pore volume. In the first case the supports behaves as a solid solvent by solvating TIM's by means of hydrogen bonding, in the same way as water does [ 21 ] . In the other case the support can act as a mere physical surface [ 22 ] . J.

Support-impregnant interactions are determined by three factors: isoelectric point of the support surface (IEPS), pH of the aqueous solution, and nature of the impregnant [ 23 ] . The adsorption of different organics onto hydrous oxide has often been referred to hydrogen bond formation. A hydrogen bond may form between two functional groups, one acting as a proton donor or Brsted acid group and another group acting as an electron donor or Lewis basic group [ 24 ] . The results obtained for four series of catalysts that were different with respect to the impregnating agent and its concentration, show that resorcinol, citric acid and tartaric acid are not as good as EDTA is when used in double impregnation. 346 J.

Influence of impregnation time in nickel nitrate solution on the active surface area of the catalysts examined. For all series of contacts, an extension of the impregnation time caused an increase in nickel content and mean size of the metal crystallites. It may be seen that the active surface area develops the best in the case when EDTA and resorcinol solution were used in the first impregnation step. The presence of citric or tartaric acids does not influenced the above mentioned value noticeably. Taking into account the structure of the organic reagents used [ 25 ] ( Table 3 ) , it can be noticed that only in the case of EDTA there exist functional groups and coordination sites. In other organic impregnants there are only functional groups (-COO-, -OH or both) . 0 480 L ~E Z \"E- 38G a C 1- 0 2 4 6 8 10 Mean Ni crystallite size (nm) Fig. 3.

Influence of the mean nickel crystallite size on the products distribution in n-butane hydrogenolysis reaction In `double impregnation' y-alumina surface hydroxyl groups are blocked due to support-organic reagent interaction [ 15,26-28 ] . Spectroscopic results suggest that EDTA adsorption on the y-alumina surface hampers the interaction between two carboxyl groups of the chelating compound and two protonated surface hydroxyl groups [ 15,26-28 ] . Adsorbed species can react as a local distributor for nickel ions introduced in the second impregnation step (there are still two carboxyl groups and two coordination sites remaining on the nitrogen atoms) [ 15,26-28] . Hydroxycarboxylic acids, i.e. citric and tartaric acid, are found to be the most effective in neutral or weakly alkaline solutions [ 29 ] . Compared with complexes of aminopolycarboxylic acids (e.g. EDTA) those of hydroxycarboxylic acids have a low stability. However, in acidic solution, citric and tartaric acid can interact with alumina protonated hydroxyl groups to form a surface complex but this species could be treated as a `protection screen' [30] and in the following impregnation by nickel ions the process should mainly proceed by the liquid filling the pore volume of the support surface. This results in large metal crystallite sizes and low degree of reduction (Table 2).

RycJcowski et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 341-349 In the aqueous solution resorcinol behaves as a weak acid. As other organic impregnants used, it can react with the y-alumina surface hydroxyl groups to form weak hydrogen bonds [ 31 ] . After adsorption, the surface species formed has a larger spherical effect than in the case of adsorbed hydroxycarboxylic acids and this can be the reason of the lower metal crystallite size in the final catalysts. Comparing the obtained data (Table 2 and Fig. 2) , it can be noticed that utilizing EDTA in the first impregnation step causes the resulting catalysts to have a more advantageous expansion of the active nickel surface area. The mean size of the nickel crystallites in this case is about two to three times smaller than in reference contacts. It can be concluded that the organic impregnant used in the first impregnation step ought to have both functional groups and coordination centres, and after being adsorbed it could react as a `protection screen' as well as a local distributor for metal ions introduced in the following impregnation step. This can result in high metal loading [ 16] , low metal crystallite size [ 13,19 ] and high degree of metal reduction (Table 2) . 4.2. Hydrogenolysis of n-butane The results obtained for the influence of nickel dispersion on the course of nbutane hydrogenolysis agree well with those presented earlier [9,10]. The maximum rate of n-butane hydrogenolysis obtained lies in the same range of nickel crystallite size as described earlier [9-12]. The methane yield passed trough a maximum in the Ni crystallite size range 1.5-4.5 nm. In the same range of metal crystallite size, the propane yield decreased strongly. The ethane yield decreased in the same range of nickel crystallite size. The increased methane yield is caused by the influence of the increased rate of demethylation of C3 species, so a direct consequence of the above ought to be an increase in the distribution for ethane. The results obtained do not indicate such a trend, but suggest that the increase in methane selectivity and the decrease in propane selectivity are induced by the change in the mechanism of n-butane hydrogenolysis in the range of the mean nickel crystallite size of 1.5-4.5 nm. The results obtained suggest that the predominant effect of the given reaction mechanism of n-butane hydrogenolysis depends on the crystallite size, and thereby probably on the number of B5 centres [9-12]. Van Hardeveld and Hartog [32] have published the results of many calculations describing the arrangements of the atoms in small metal particles. At the edges of added layers, a particularly interesting ensemble of five atoms is formed, called a BS site [32,33]. The concentration of BS sites as a popular explanation for structure sensitivity [9,10,34]. In the crystallite size range 1.5-4.5 nm the reaction might proceed mainly through the parallel-consecutive mechanism. In addition to the presented range of nickel dispersion, the predominant role might be played by the consecutive-parallel mechanism in n-butane hydrogenolysis on nickel. J.

The obtained results suggest that n-butane hydrogenolysis depends on the crystallite size of nickel. In the crystallite size range of 1.5–4.5 nm the reaction might proceed mainly through the parallel-consecutive mechanism.
