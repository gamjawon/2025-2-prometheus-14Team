Graphical abstract We demonstrate the catalytic performance of perovskite-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst based on LaMnO3+δ nanoparticles (LMO NPs) prepared using the laser ablation synthesis in solution method. The ORR catalytic activity of the post-annealed LMO NPs was similar to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts due to the increased surface area as well as the perovskite crystalline structure of the LMO NPs. The mass and specific activities of the LMO NP catalyst annealed at 800°C were 20 and 2.2 times higher than those of the bulk LMO, respectively. In a chronoamperometric stability test, our LMO NP catalyst (annealed at 800°C) outperformed the Pt/C catalyst. Keywords Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst Perovskite oxide LaMnO3+δ Electrochemical activity 1 Introduction The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the electrochemical energy conversion process requires highly efficient and cost-effective catalysts that are directly linked to the efficiency of fuel cells and metal-air batteries [1–4]. The ORR catalysts must possess a sufficiently high chemical activity (mass and specific) to activate O2 and release the oxygen from the surface in the form of H2O, even under extremely corrosive conditions [5]. The ORR mechanism at the surface of the catalyst in an alkaline media can be expressed as, (1) O 2 + 2 H 2 O + 4 e - → 4 OH - ( Four electron process ) , (2) O 2 + H 2 O + 2 e - → HO 2 - + OH - ( Two electron process ) , (3) HO 2 - + H 2 O + 2 e - → + 3 OH - . The catalyst is required to stabilize the adsorbed OH before breaking the O-O bond and to desorb OH that are formed after the dissociation [5]. Noble metal catalysts such as Pt nanoparticles dispersed on a carbon black (CB) support are the most widely used ORR catalysts; however, their scarcity and high cost have triggered the development of various non-metal catalysts such as perovskite oxides (chemical formula: ABO3) as an alternative to noble-metal catalysts [4–7]. One advantage of perovskite catalysts is the ability to manipulate the catalytic performances by simply choosing appropriate A and B cations in the ABO3 structure [5–10]. Due to the octahedral coordination (BO6), the valence d-band of the B cation splits into σ bonding-antibonding (eg) levels and π bonding-antibonding (t2g) levels. Any transition metal oxide-based perovskite, that has the σ∗-orbital (eg) occupation of nearly 1 (Sabatier’s principle), would exhibit the maximum ORR [5,6]. When an eg filling ≪1, strong oxygen binding occurs and causes a poor desorption; an eg filling ≫1 causes poor oxygen activation. An ideal eg filling of nearly one is required for enhanced ORR catalytic activity [5]. Among the various perovskite oxides, LaMnO3+δ (LMO) satisfies the Sabatier’s principle with a remarkable catalytic performance compared to other perovskites [5]. However, the kinetics of the ORR mass activity of the bulk LMO catalyst at the cathode is still slow (∼2mA/mgoxide) compared to that of the noble catalysts (e.g., Pt), which results in the poor efficiency of the devices. The mass activity of the catalysts is affected by particle size, shape, electric conductivity, and porosity of the particles. Along with a high crystallinity, the effective surface area of the ORR catalysts should be increased to enhance the mass activity as well as to lower the accompanying overpotential—an additional voltage to operate the devices. Various methods have been employed to increase the effective surface area of the ORR catalysts. One feasible way is the synthesis of nanoparticles through which effective surface area can be enhanced. Even though the synthesized nanoparticles have high surface area, calcination/annealing of these nanoparticles at high temperatures (>600°C) is required to form crystalline perovskite phase. This calcination usually results in significant agglomeration leading to the formation of low surface area particles (particle size >200nm). It is challenging to synthesize phase pure nanoparticles with a high surface area and controlled perovskite phase crystallinity to obtain efficient and stable ORR catalysts. Here, we present a new strategy, by utilizing the benefits of higher surface area of the nanoparticles (NPs) along with a controlled crystallinity for the enhancement of the electrochemical properties through the synthesis of LMO NPs followed by crystallization process during an annealing step. The nano-sized particles were synthesized using the laser ablation synthesis in solution (LASiS) technique, which is a simple, fast, cheap, and clean process compared to conventional chemical methods [11]. LASiS is an eco-friendly way to synthesize pure nanomaterials because no chemical additions are required and no chemical by-products are formed during the process [11]. After the synthesis, LMO NPs were mixed with graphitized carbon black followed by annealing at 600 and 800°C to enhance the crystalline quality, while controlling the agglomeration/coalescence of the particles. Our LMO NPs annealed at 800°C, exhibited perovskite phase crystallinity with an average particle size of 24nm. Our LMO NPs, that were annealed at 800°C, outperformed the commercial carbon-supported Pt catalyst in a stability test and exhibited comparable ORR activity. 2 Materials and methods The LMO powder was prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction of the constituent oxides: La2O3 (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) and MnO2 (99.997%, Alfa Aesar). La2O3 (10.1g) and MnO2 (5.39g) powders were placed in a zirconia jar (in a 1:2M ratio) with isopropyl alcohol and zirconia balls, and then mixed using a planetary ball mill (Planetary Mono Mill PULVERISETTE 6, FRITSCH) at 300rpm for 2h. The mixed powder was dried at 100°C in an oven followed by calcination at 900°C for 12h in air to form LMO. The LMO powder (3g) was pressed in a disk-shaped mold with a 24mm diameter and then made into pellets using the cold isostatic pressing method at a pressure of 1500kg/cm2 for 15min. Finally, the pellets were sintered at 1200°C for 24h in air. The LASiS experiments were performed at room temperature using the 4th harmonic (266nm) of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (Nanosecond laser: Quanta-Ray LAB-150-, Spectra-Physics) with a pulse duration of 4ns. The laser repetition rate was set to 10Hz. A laser beam was focused on a LMO target immersed in ethanol. The laser energy and spot size were approximately 65mJ/pulse and 1.5mm respectively, which corresponded to a laser fluence of 3.67J/cm2. Finally, the obtained colloidal solution containing the LMO NPs was mixed with graphitized carbon black (GCB, >99.95%, Sigma Aldrich) treated with 6M HCl (Duksan Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd.) by sonication, followed by drying at 80°C in an oven. The as-synthesized LMO NPs-GCB mixture was furnace-annealed at 600°C or 800°C for 30min in air to crystallize the LMO powder. A schematic illustration of the synthesis is shown in Fig. 1 . All electrochemical measurements were conducted using a rotating disk electrode (RDE, Pine Instrument Company). A catalyst ink was prepared by sonicating the LMO powder, carbon black (CB, Vulcan XC 72), and Nafion (5wt%, Ion Power) at a 5:1:1 mass ratio with 1mL of ethanol for 20min. This yielded inks with final concentrations of 5mgoxide/mLink, 1mgCB/mLink, and 1mgNafion/mLink. Next, 40μL of the catalyst ink was loaded onto a glassy carbon electrode (0.196cm2 area, Pine Instrument Company). The final composition of LMO on an electrode was 1mg/cm2. The 0.1M KOH electrolyte was prepared from Milli-Q water (18MΩcm) and a KOH solution. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as a reference electrode, which was calibrated with respect to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE); the counter electrode was a Pt wire. All measurements were performed at 10mV/s in a N2 or O2 saturated environment. Polarization curves were measured from −0.7V to 0.3V vs. SCE. The chronoamperometric responses were conducted at −0.3123V vs. SCE for 20,000s. An X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 ADVANCE) was used at a voltage of 40kV and a current of 40mA to confirm the crystalline quality and structural phase of the samples. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using Perkin Elmer TGA 4000. The samples were heated from room temperature to 900°C in air at a scan rate of 10°C/min. The surface morphology of the synthesized NPs was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-7400F) operated at a voltage of 10kV and a current of 20μA. We used transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin) to analyze the particle size and the crystalline quality of the synthesized LMO NPs. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) coupled to energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed at a voltage of 200kV to analyze the fine structure of the NPs. All samples were dispersed in ethanol by sonication for 10min and loaded onto a silicon substrate or a carbon-coated copper grid for the SEM and TEM measurements, respectively. 3 Results and discussion The microstructure and morphology of the bulk LMO, as-grown LMO synthesized via LASiS (LASiS LMO), 600°C-annealed LMO synthesized via LASiS (LASiS LMO 600), and 800°C-annealed LMO synthesized via LASiS (LASiS LMO 800) were observed using SEM and TEM. The SEM images of the bulk LMO and the TEM and HRTEM images of the LASiS LMO are shown in the supplementary information (Fig. S1). The bulk LMO target contained aggregated particles with a particle size above 200nm, due to the long duration of the solid-state reaction. However, the average LMO particle size was reduced down to 12nm after the LASiS process. The LASiS LMO samples annealed at 600 and 800°C were visualized using TEM and HRTEM, as shown in Fig. 2 . The TEM and HRTEM images of the LASiS LMO 600 sample show that the LMO NPs were supported on the residual GCB. However, no traces of GCB were found in the LASiS LMO 800 sample, indicating that annealing at 800°C resulted in the complete evaporation of GCB. This was also confirmed using TG analysis as shown in supplementary Fig. S2. From the Fig. S2 it is apparent that bulk LMO does not show any weight loss until 900°C while GCB completely evaporates at 820°C. The bulk LMO/GCB composite mixed at 1:1 ratio exhibits 50% weight loss at 730°C which confirms that all the GCB is evaporated at 730°C in the composite. It should be noted that at 600°C only 5% weight loss was observed and almost 95% of GCB remains in the bulk LMO/GCB composite. Additional TEM/HRTEM images of LaSiS LMO 600 and LaSiS LMO 800 samples are shown in supplementary Fig. S3. From the HRTEM of both LASiS LMO 600 and 800 catalysts (Fig. 2b, d, and e), a d-spacing value of 0.27nm is observed which is indexed to either (110) or (104) plane of LaMnO3+δ. The average particle size (with standard deviation) of the LASiS LMO 600 (inset of Fig. S3b) and LASiS LMO 800 (inset of Fig. S3d) particles was 19.14±5.29nm and 24.88±4.71nm, respectively. HAADF-STEM-EDS was used to analyze the component distribution of La, Mn, and O in the LMO NPs (Fig. 2(f–i)). The elemental mapping of the particles indicated a homogenous distribution of La, Mn, and O. The XRD patterns of the bulk LMO, LASiS LMO, LASiS LMO 600, and LASiS LMO 800 samples are shown in supplementary Fig. S4. The LASiS LMO sample did not show any crystalline reflection peaks, which indicates an amorphous structure. However, the LASiS LMO 600, and LASiS LMO 800 showed the characteristic reflections of the perovskite LMO (standard perovskite phase with a rhombohedral structure) with a formulae LaMnO3.15. According to the Scherrer analysis, the crystallite size D were calculated using Eq. (4). (4) D = K λ β cos θ where D is the crystallite size, K is a dimensionless shape factor (typical value of about 0.9), λ is the X-ray wavelength (Cu Kα, 0.154nm), θ is the Bragg angle and β is the full width half maximum value at θ. The crystallite size of LASiS LMO 600 and LASiS LMO 800 was 19.6 and 24.2nm, respectively, which were in well agreement with the size obtained using TEM analysis. The ORR catalytic activity was measured by loading the samples on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and using a RDE with an O2-saturated 0.1M KOH electrolyte. Commercial Pt/C (20wt% Pt) was also tested under the same conditions for comparison. The measurements were performed in a cathodic sweep with 10mV/s at various rotation speeds (100, 400, 900, and 1600rpm). The disk currents obtained from the ORR activities (with RDE at 1600rpm) on bulk LMO, LASiS LMO, LASiS LMO 600, LASiS LMO 800, and Pt/C are plotted as a function of voltage in Fig. 3 (a). For the bulk LMO and LASiS LMO catalysts, the disk current decreased at a higher rate when the potential increased. The LASiS LMO exhibited a poor catalytic activity with a lower onset potential and a disk current, apparently due to its amorphous nature. This clearly indicates that not only the higher surface area of the nanoparticles but also the perovskite phase-crystalline structure is a critical factor that controls the catalytic performance of the LMO NPs. However, the bulk LMO catalyst showed a poor catalytic activity even with the perovskite crystalline structure owing to its low surface area/large particle size (>200nm). Compared to the bulk LMO and LASiS LMO catalysts, the LASiS LMO 600 and LASiS LMO 800 catalysts showed a much higher current density at 0.9V, which indicates that the higher surface area/reduced particle size (<55nm) along with a higher crystalline quality (perovskite phase) of the particles dramatically promoted the kinetic current. The kinetic current at 0.9V was similar to that of the Pt/C catalyst. The ORR mechanism of a perovskite catalyst occurs by a competition between the OH− displacement and OH− regeneration on the surface of the octahedral coordinated transition-metal ion in an alkaline solution [12]. Our studies indicate that the higher surface area along with a controlled perovskite phase crystallinity of the LASiS LMO 600 and LASiS LMO 800 catalysts has accelerated the oxygen reduction rate. As observed from the TEM images, the bulk LMO had a large particle size/low surface area, which led to a poor ORR activity. The ORR activity increased as follows: LASiS LMO<bulk LMO<LASiS LMO 600/LASiS LMO 800/Pt/C. The ORR half-wave potentials of all catalysts are summarized in Table S1. We also measured the polarization curves of the LASiS LMO 800 catalyst at 1600, 900, 400, and 100rpm (Fig. 3(b)). We obtained the Koutecky-Levich plots from the potentials of the mass transfer limit region (Fig. 3(c)). The electron transfer number of ORR was estimated to be approximately 4.02 from 0.6 to 0.7V from the slope of the Koutecky-Levich plots, suggesting that the LASiS LMO 800 catalyst favored highly desired four electron ORR process [13–16]. This also confirms that LASiS LMO 800 possessed a similar ORR catalytic activity to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. For the LASiS LMO 800 sample, the ORR activity performance in a small over-potential region was evaluated using the Tafel plot in comparison with the bulk LMO catalyst. The Tafel plots also show that our LASiS LMO 800 catalyst possessed a similar ORR activity to that of the Pt/C catalyst. Additionally, the LASiS LMO 800 catalyst exhibited a smaller Tafel slope of 64mV/decade, while that of the bulk LMO was 162mV/decade in the charge transfer region (Fig. 3(d)) indicating a faster kinetics in LASiS LMO 800 catalyst. It is worth mentioning that our LASiS LMO 800 catalyst showed an ORR mass activity of 22μA/μgoxide, which was about 20 times higher than that of the bulk LMO (1.09μA/μgoxide, Fig. 3e). The mass ORR activity of Pt/C catalyst shows a value around 1176μA/μgPt. The specific activity of the bulk LMO and LASiS LMO 800 catalysts shown in Fig. 3e, was also calculated using the specific surface area of the catalyst particles. (The details of the calculation of specific surface area of the catalysts are described in supplementary information.) The LASiS LMO 800 catalyst exhibits an ORR specific activity of 100μA/cm2, which is about 2.2 times higher than that of the bulk LMO (45μA/cm2). The LASiS LMO 800 catalyst exhibited a better stability than the Pt/C 20wt% catalyst in the O2-saturated 0.1M KOH electrolyte (Fig. 3f). In the chronoamperometric test, the LASiS LMO 800 catalyst showed a decrease of approximately 4% for 20,000s operation at 0.7V vs. RHE; Fig. 3f, blue line. Meanwhile, the Pt/C 20wt% catalyst exhibited a decrease corresponding to 10% over 10,000s (Fig. 3f, brown line). Our LASiS LMO 800 catalyst exhibited a higher durability than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst at similar common operating potentials. A relatively higher percentage of perovskite phase crystals along with low particle size/higher surface area in the LASiS LMO 800 catalyst provided enough active sites for oxygen diffusion through the LMO NPs, thereby accelerating and sustaining the reduction rate. This suggests that, by manipulating the crystalline quality and the surface area of the NPs (through controlling the particle size), the mass/specific activity as well as stability of the perovskite catalyst for oxygen reduction could be enhanced. 4 Conclusions In summary, we demonstrated a simple top-down method to synthesize LaMnO3+δ NPs catalysts with high surface area and perovskite crystalline structure for ORR. Without any significant increase in the particle size, the crystalline quality of the amorphous as-synthesized LMO NPs was enhanced by post-annealing at 600 and 800°C. Various electrochemical analyses revealed that the 800°C-annealed LMO NPs catalyst exhibited a comparable catalytic activity to the commercial Pt/C catalyst and a higher stability than the Pt/C catalyst. Our top-down synthesis combined with the post-annealing of the NPs formed a stable LMO catalyst with an enhanced catalytic mass ORR activity (up to 20 times) and specific ORR activity (up to 2.2 times) than the mass/specific ORR activity of the bulk LMO catalyst. Our approach of enhancing perovskite phase in LMO crystals, without any significant increase in particle size, could be extended to other perovskite catalysts where designs of highly active as well as stable catalysts for oxygen reduction are in high demand.
