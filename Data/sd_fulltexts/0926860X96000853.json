Box 168, Szeged, Hungary Received 16 November 1995; revised 7 February 1996; accepted 8 February 1996 Abstract The conversion of methane into higher hydrocarbons and benzene on K2MoO4/ZSM-5 catalyst has been investigated under non-oxidizing conditions in a fixed bed, continuous flow reactor. The effects of different parameters (space velocity, reduction and calcination tempera- tures, methane concentration) on the conversion of methane were also examined. The reaction of methane was observed above 923 K. In the initial period, the complete oxidation of methane was the dominant process. After a partial reduction of the catalyst the formation of several hydrocar- bons was observed. The main products were benzene, ethylene and ethane. The selectivity to benzene was in the range of 60-70% at 1.2-6.3% methane conversion, The catalyst was found to be active in the dehydrogenation of ethane and in the aromatization of ethylene. Examination of the used catalyst by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggested the formation of MozC. The active surface species and the possible mechanism of the reaction are discussed.

Introduction After an extensive study of the oxidative coupling of methane on various oxide systems [1,2], there is an increasing interest towards the methane conver- sion under non-oxidative conditions. On supported Pt metals the decomposition of methane was observed at as low as 473-523 K [3-10]. From the comparison of the specific rates (turnover frequency), the silica supported Ru and Rh proved to be the most effective Pt metals [5,6]. The main products of the methane * Corresponding author. Tel./fax: (+ 36-62) 322-378. 0926-860X/96/$15.00 Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PI1 S0926- 860X(96)00085-3 362 A. Szgke, F. Solvmosi / Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996)361-374 decomposition were hydrogen and carbon, with a small amount of ethane. Higher hydrocarbons were produced only in the hydrogenation of the carbona- ceous species formed in the methane decomposition [3-10]. More attractive results were obtained on MoO3/ZSM-5. Wang et al. [11], reported that the dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane proceed on this catalyst at 973 K. At a 7.2% methane conversion, the selectivity to benzene was given as 100%. The ability of MoO3/ZSM-5 to convert methane into benzene was confirmed by our subsequent study, the selectivity to benzene (based on the C-containing gaseous products) was calculated to be lower, 61.0% at the steady state at 973 K [12]. We reported the following new findings: (i) the reaction is preceded by an induction period, (ii) the reduction of Mo6+ to Mo4+ and the deposition of carbon occur during the reaction, (iii) MoO3/SiO2 also exhibits a good catalytic performance; the highest selectivity to benzene was 56% on this catalyst at a methane conversion of 3.2% [12]. These features have been also observed recently by Lunsford et al. [13]. As an extension of this work, in the present paper we examine the conversion of CH4 on supported K2MoO4, with properties different from those of the supported MoO3 catalysts. This catalyst was already tested in the selective oxidation of ethane with N20. It proved to be more stable and selective (towards acetaldehyde formation) than the MoO3/SiO2 catalyst [14]. The active surface species involved and the mechanism of the aromatization of CH4 are consid- ered, with catalyst characterization at different stages of the reaction by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Reactions of the primary products of methane conversion (C2H6 and C2H4) on this catalyst are also investigated. 2. Experimental The reactor and the product analysis have been described previously [12]. Briefly, reactions were carried out in a fixed-bed, continuous flow reactor consisting of a quartz tube (20 mm i.d.) connected to a capillary tube. Undiluted gases (CH4, C2H6 and CzH4) were used. The flow rate was 12 ml/min. Analysis of the exit gases was performed with a HP 5890 gas chromatograph on Porapak Q column. The methane conversion was calculated from the H2 and H20 balance. The selectivity values of product formation represent the fraction of methane that has been converted to the specific products taking into account of the number of carbon atoms in the molecules. A pulse reactor was also employed (8 m o.d. quartz tube), which was incorporated between the sample inlet and the column of the gas chromatograph. In this case 0.3 g of the sample was used. The XPS measurements were performed in a Kratos XSAM 800 instrument at a base pressure of 10-8 Torr using Mg Ks primary radiation (14 kV, 15 mA). Binding energies for K2MoO4/ZSM-5 were referenced to the zeolitic Si(2p) at A. Szgke, F. Solymosi / Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 361-374 363 103.4 eV. Binding energies for Mo2C were normalized to the Fermi level of Mo. The pass energy was set at 40 eV; and an energy step width of 50 meV, and dwell time of 300 ms, were used. Typically 10 scans were accumulated for each spectrum. Fitting and deconvolution of the spectra were made using the VISION software (Kratos). The pretreatment of the samples was performed in the catalytic reactor. In order to prevent oxidation, the catalyst was kept in N2 during its transfer to the sample holder of XPS system. The catalysts were prepared by impregnating H-ZSM-5 (Si/AI = 55.0) or SiO2 (Cab-O-Sil) with an aqueous solution of KzMOO4 to yield a nominal 2 wt.-% KzMoO4. The K-A1 ratio of the KzMoO4/ZSM-5 catalyst was 0.55. The suspensions were dried at 373 K and calcined at 873 K for 5 h. Mo2C was prepared by the method of Lee et al. [15]. The amount of catalyst used was in general 0.5 g. The reactants CH4 (99.995%), CzH6 (99.99%) and CzH4 (99.9%) were used as received. 3. Results 3.1. Reactions of methane Reaction of methane on K2MoO4/ZSM-5 was observed at and above 923 K (Fig. 1). At the very beginning of the reaction, partial reduction of the catalyst predominated, as indicated by the formation of CO, CO2 and H20. This was followed by a short acceleration period, when the conversion of CH4 increased, ~4 => 8 2 0 o 20 40 60 80 lOO 12o 14o 160 180 200 220 ~ne [n~n] Fig. 1.

Rate and selectivity of the formation of various products in the reaction of methane on K 2 M4/ZSM-5 at 973 K. attained a maximum and then decreased. At 1073 K, the highest methane conversion reached was about 6.5%, which decayed to 1.8% after 3 h. After attaining the maximum conversion, the evolution of H20 and CO2 ceased, and only CO and hydrocarbons were produced. The main hydrocarbons formed were C2H6, CzH4 and C6H6, with minor amounts of C3H8 and CvH8 (Fig. 2A). After the maximum conversion, the rates of the formation of all products decreased, except for that of ethylene, which increased in time. In harmony with this the selectivity of the formation of ethylene (taking into account only the carbon-containing gaseous products) gradually increased from almost zero to about 40% in 3 h, depending on the temperature. The selectivity of ethane formation was low (5-8%) throughout the measurements independently of the temperature. The selectivity of benzene production was the highest (60-70%) at around the maximum conversion of CH4; it subsequently slowly diminished (Fig. 2B). This behavior of the catalyst can be well regenerated with an oxygen treatment at 973 K. For comparison we show the results obtained on 2% MoO3/ZSM-5 catalyst (Fig. 3). On this sample the highest initial conversion at 973 K was 5.7%, which decreased to about 2% in 4 h. The selectivity to benzene was 75-65% during this time. Whereas the selectivity to ethane, 5%, remained constant in 4 h; the selectivity to ethylene increased in the time on stream. This latter value is considerably lower (below 20%) than that measured for K2MOO4/ZSM-5. The same is valid for the selectivity of CO formation (Fig. 3B). A. Sz6ke, F.

Conversion of methane, rate and selectivity of the formation of various products on MoO3/ZSM-5 catalyst at 973 K. Following the pretreatment of the K2MoO4/ZSM-5 catalyst with methane at 973 K for 3 h, the temperature dependence of the product formation was determined by descending and increasing the temperature. Lowering the temper- ature caused a decay in the selectivity of benzene formation and an increase in that of CO production. The selectivities for other products remained practically unaltered. In the subsequent studies we examined the effects of various factors and experimental conditions on the reaction of methane and on the product distribu- tion. The conversion of methane and the selectivity to benzene decreased, while the selectivity to ethylene and the ratio of ethylene to ethane increased with increasing space velocity of methane. As regards the effect of the calcination temperature we found no significant differences in the catalytic performance of the samples calcined between 673-973 K. This is very likely due to the high reaction temperature. When the sample was sintered at 1073 K before the experiment, the initial conversion decreased by a factor of 2, but the selectivities to various hydrocarbon products remained practically unaltered. Detailed measurements were performed concerning the effect of prereduction (with H2) on the catalytic performance of KzMoO4/ZSM-5. As shown in Fig. 4A, the reaction of methane started with a maximum rate on the prereduced catalysts. Highest initial conversion was obtained for the sample prereduced at 873 K for 1 h. Increasing the reduction temperature or the time of the reduction caused a decay in the initial conversion. The effect of prereduction was 366 A. Sziike, F.

Effects of the prereduction of K 2 MoO4/ZSM-5 on the reaction of methane at 973 K. exhibited in the steady state values, too. Another important influence of the prereduction is an appreciable increase in the selectivity to benzene (Fig. 4B). It is important to mention that no reaction of methane occurred on Mo-free ZSM-5 under the same conditions. When K2MoO4 was deposited on SiO2, the conversion of methane at 973 K was only 0.4-01%. The main hydrocarbon product was ethane. 3.2. Reaction of ethane Ethane interacted readily with K2MOO4/ZSM-5 at 973 K, as indicated by the high initial conversion (ca. 32%), which decayed to ca. 15% after 20 min. At the beginning of the reaction, a significant amount of methane was produced in addition to H2 and C2H4 (Fig. 5A). CO, CO2 and H20 were also detected. The H2/C2H4 ratio in the steady state approached the value of 1.2-1.3, indicating that the main process in this stage is the dehydrogenation of ethane. Minor products were benzene, propane and butene. The initial selectivity of benzene formation was 14%, which gradually decreased to 3-4% in the steady state (Fig. 5B). The selectivities of the formation of various products were practically the same in the temperature range of 923-973 K. The rate of dehydrogenation of ethane was also high (14% conversion) on Mo-free ZSM-5. A significant amount of methane (S= 16-18%) was also A. Sz6ke, F.

When SiO2 was used as a support, the conversion of ethane was less (ca. 11%), but was constant up to 3 h. The main products were C2H4 and H2 with almost 1:1 ratio. In addition, CH4 (S = 2.5-3%), butane (S ca. 2%) and propane (S ca. 2%) were identified. Benzene was detected only in trace amount. 3.3. Reaction of ethylene It is known that ethylene is readily transformed on the acidic sites of zeolites into higher hydrocarbons and aromatics, with high conversion and selectivity at and far below 973 K [16]. This was confirmed on the H-ZSM-5 used in the present study. At 973 K the selectivity to benzene was about 30% at a conversion of 75-78%. Deposition of KzMoO4 on this zeolite destroyed some of the acidic sites and somewhat reduced both the conversion to benzene and its selectivity. At 973 K the coke deposition was very fast, as a result the conversion of ethylene decreased from 32% to 22% in 60 min. The main hydrocarbons were ethane (S = 27-40%), propane (S = 18-22%) and butane (S = 7-16%). The selectiv- ity for benzene formation was 10-13%. When the reaction temperature was lowered to 873 K the initial conversion was 18%, which decayed to 4% in 3 h. Besides H2, all the hydrocarbons 368 A. SzOke, F.

The rates of the formation of the products followed the decay pattern of the conversion. Highest values were obtained for propane and butane (Fig. 6A). The selectivity of the formation of propane and butane increased in time, whereas that for other products decreased or remained unchanged (Fig. 6B). The selectivity of benzene forma- tion fell in the range 12-7%. 3.4. Examination of the catalysts Following the reaction of methane on MoO3/SiO2 we measured a significant amount of carbon deposit on the catalysts [2]. This was observed on the K2MoO4 samples, too. In order to determine the time-dependence of carbon deposition, the reaction was interrupted at several stages and the catalyst bed was flushed with pure nitrogen until no hydrocarbons were detected. Afterwards the catalyst was exposed to hydrogen at 973 K and the amount of hydrocarbons were determined. The main product of the hydrogenation was methane with a trace amount of ethane. The formation of methane did not cease even after 120 min. As Fig. 7A shows the carbon was gradually built up on the catalyst up to 40-60 min: its amount after 120 min of methane conversion at 973 K was 403 I~mol/g. Fig. 7B shows that the hydrogenation of carbon deposited starts at 773 K and became more intensive above this temperature. A somewhat different A. SzOke, F.

In this case CO2 evolution was observed even at 573 K and the oxidation was complete at 873 K. The total amount of carbon measured by oxidation and reduction was 540 and 590 ~mol/g, respectively. Detailed XPS study was carried out with the fresh and used KzMoO4/ZSM-5 catalysts. Some characteristic XPS spectra are presented in Fig. 8. In the analysis of XP spectra of the catalyst we followed the approach of previous works [17]. In the oxidized catalyst the Mo peaks appeared at 235.5 and 232.3 eV. In an accord with previous TPR measurements [14], the initial reduction of K2MoO4 with H2 was faster, but the overall reduction was slower than with MoO3/SiOz. Treatment of KzMoO4/ZSM-5 with CH4 at 973 K for 20 rain caused no significant changes in the XPS spectra for Mo. After CH4 reaction for 120 min, however, a new Mo(3d) peak appeared at 227.8 eV. In the C(ls) region a broad peak was observed. Treatment of this sample with H2 at 873 K removed a fraction of the carbon deposited on the sample. The remaining carbon gave a peak at 283.8 eV. For comparison, we measured the XPS spectrum of Mo2C (its excess carbon was also removed by hydrogenation at 873 K). The binding energy for Mo(3d) was 228.2 eV and that for C(ls) 283.8 eV. These values suggest that CH4 treatment transforms a significant amount of MoO3 into MozC. Note that the amount of carbon formed in 120 min of CH4 reaction is about one order of magnitude larger than that corresponding to MozC. 370 A. SzSke, F.

As observed for supported MoO3 [11-13], the catalytic performance and selectivity of Kz MoO4 are strongly influenced by the extent of K 2Mo04 reduction and the nature of the support. Nevertheless, the behavior of KeMoO4 differs in many respects from that of MoO3. The main differences are as follows: (i) there is only a very short induction period on KzMoO4/ZSM-5: maximum CH4 conversion was measured after an accelera- tion period of 10-15 min; (ii) in this case silica was an almost completely inactive support; (iii) the highest selectivity of benzene formation was measured at the beginning of the reaction, whereas on the MoO3-based catalysts it gradually increased with increasing contact time, i.e. with the progress of the reduction of Mo6+. In both cases, a significant deactivation of the catalysts was experienced which is very likely due to the carbon deposition on the molybde- num surface and on the channels of ZSM-5. The obvious first step in the conversion of methane is its activation which could be an oxidative dehydrogenation process CH4(g) q- O(s) ~ CH3 -4- OH(~) (1) 2OH ~ H20 (2) The fact that we did not find the evolution of H20 after the initial reduction of the catalyst does not support the importance of the reaction (1) in the conversion of methane into higher hydrocarbons. However, the dissociation of methane to give CH3 species may occur on the reduced centers, as was observed on supported metals [3-10] CH4 ~ CH3 + H (3) This step is followed by the decomposition of CH3 to carbon CH 3 ~ CH 2 + H (4) CH2 ~ CH + H (5) CH ~ C + H (6) through the transient formation of CH2 and CH species. Parallel, the recombina- tion of CH3 may also proceed, yielding ethane. It is known that the recombina- tion of CH3 occurs readily in the gas phase [ 18], and also on some solid surfaces [19-21]. 2CH3 ~ C2H6 (7) Exploratory studies revealed that the coupling of CH3 species (generated by the pyrolysis of azomethane) is facile on partially reduced Mo catalysts, too [22,23]. 372 A. Sz6ke, F. Solymosi / Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 361-374 There are two routes for the formation of ethylene: the dehydrogenation of ethane, C2H6 ~ CzH4 + H2 and/or the coupling of CH2 species 2CH2 ~ C2H4 (also observed on solid surfaces [24,25]). Although the KzMoO4/ZSM-5 catalyzed the dehydrogenation of ethane, and the formation of benzene was also observed during the reaction (Fig. 5), the selectivity to benzene was much lower than in the case of methane conversion. This suggests that the coupling of CH2 species is the main reaction pathway in the ethylene production. The reactivity and reaction pathways of ethylene on KzMoO4/ZSM-5 and on ZSM-5 itself strongly suggest that the oligomerization and aromatization of ethylene proceed on the acidic sites of the ZSM-5 support. The nature of the active sites involved in the activation of methane leading to the production of ethane and ethylene remains an open question. These surface sites should satisfy the following basic requirements: (i) activation of one of the C-H bonds in the methane molecule to yield CH3 (ii) lower activity towards the decomposition of CHfragments to carbon, and (iii) the selective dehydrogena- tion of ethane to ethylene. The fact that the main products of the initial interaction of methane with MoO3 deposited on various supports are CO, COe and H20 clearly shows that this active species is not Mo6+. However, hydrocar- bons and benzene appeared in the products following the reduction of Mo6+ to Mo4+ [12], which suggests that Mo4+ is required for the production of the above compounds. We also measured the deposition of a significant amount of carbon on both the MoO3 [12] and the KzMoO4 catalysts, thus it can be assumed that the high-temperature methane conversion is accompanied by the formation of Mo~C, which functions as active sites. Wang et al. [13] identified the formation of Mo2C from MoO3/ZSM-5, as we did from MoO3/SiO2 [22,23]. XPS results on methane-treated KzMoOa/ZSM-5 also suggest the formation of Mo2C (Fig. 8). However, the experiments carried out so far with MozC in the conversion of methane did not lead to positive results [22,23]. Although MozC, similarly to Pt metals [3-10] can activate methane, its effect was much less than observed on MoO3/ZSM-5 and KzMoO4/ZSM-5 catalysts. In addition, neither ethane and ethylene, nor higher aliphatic hydrocarbons and benzene were produced in more than trace amounts [22,23]. The situation was similar when MoaC was deposited on ZSM-5. This suggests that, besides Mo2C, the presence of some other Mo compounds, perhaps the oxygen-deficient MoO2, is also necessary for the activation of methane, and for the promotion of the formation of ethylene from CHx fragments. This consideration is different from that proposed by Wang et al. [11] who assumed that the activation of CH4 proceeds via the polarization of CH4 molecule on the MoO3, and the reaction of polarized molecule, H--CH~, on the Br~Snsted acid sites of H-ZSM-5 zeolite. A. Sz6ke, F. Solymosi / Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 361-374 373 We have also performed a comparative study of the catalytic effects of other alkali metal molybdates (M2MoO4) on ZSM-5 in the conversion of CH4. The general behavior was the same as that established for K2MoO4/ZSM-5. The initial conversion decreased in the sequence M -- Cs > Rb > K > Na > Li. The selectivity for benzene production (maximum values: 40-60%) followed practi- cally the same sequence, whereas that for the formation of ethylene was the opposite. 5. Conclusions (i) The reaction of methane with K2MoO4/ZSM-5 was observed above 923 K. After an initial reduction of the catalyst the formation of benzene, ethylene and ethane was observed. (ii) K2MoO4/ZSM exhibited good catalytic activity in the oligomerization and aromatization of ethane. (iii) The deposition of carbon was observed during the methane conversion and the formation of Mo2C was indicated by XPS study.

The conversion of methane into higher hydrocarbons and benzene on K2MoO4/ZSM-5 catalyst has been investigated under non-oxidizing conditions in a fixed bed, continuous flow reactor. The effects of different parameters (space velocity, reduction and calcination temperatures, methane concentration) on the conversion of methane were also examined. The reaction of methane was observed above 923 K. In the initial period, the complete oxidation of methane was the dominant process. After a partial reduction of the catalyst the formation of several hydrocarbons was observed. The main products were benzene, ethylene and ethane. The selectivity to benzene was in the range of 60–70% at 1.2–6.3% methane conversion. The catalyst was found to be active in the dehydrogenation of ethane and in the aromatization of ethylene. Examination of the used catalyst by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggested the formation of Mo2C. The active surface species and the possible mechanism of the reaction are discussed.
