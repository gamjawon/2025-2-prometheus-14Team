We suggest that the catalytically active substances are most likely to be NaCl-promoted sodium zirconium phosphates and NaC1 plays a key role in activity and selectivity of the catalyst system, The highest C2+ selectivity was 79% at the methane conversion of 28% (C2+ yield 22%) and the highest C2+ yield was about 30% with the C2+ selectivity of 66-70% at the methane conversion of 41--44%. The ethene/ethane ratio higher than 10 and the C3+ selectivity of about 10-20% were obtained. Over the catalysts with the Na/Zr ratio greater than about 2, the C2+ selectivity did not decrease much with time on-stream in spite of the significant decrease of the activity. The main reason for the catalyst deactivation is probably the disappearance of NaC1. @J 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction Direct catalytic conversion of methane to C2 and higher hydrocarbons (C2+) by oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is a potential route for the production of useful chemicals and fuels from abundant natural gas. A large number of materials have so far been found to be effective in catalyzing the OCM, but more effective catalysts are still being sought [1-4]. Many of the good catalysts for the OCM contain at least one *Corresponding author.

Zirconium-based catalysts have attracted relatively little attention, but recently it has been shown that sodium-chloride-promoted ZrO2, similarly to the oxi- des of titanium, manganese and bismuth, exhibits noticeable C2selectivities [5-7]. It has been sug- gested that the high performance of the promoted ZrO2 catalysts and other chlorine-containing catalysts could be obtained if the precursors of active compo- nents undergo drastic physical and chemical changes during the preparation processes [5-81. In the previous work [7], we found that a Na+-ZrO2-C1- catalyst 0926-860X/97/$17.00 '.~, 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. Pll S0926-860X(97)00 1 04-X L6 K.J. Yoon, S.W. Seo/Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) L5-LIO prepared from a mixed solution of zirconyl chloride and sodium carbonate, which were transformed to ZrO2 and NaC1 during preparation, showed a good catalytic performance for the OCM and suggested that a basic sodium salt might be a more effective pre- cursor of the promoter than a neutral salt. In this work, sodium pyrophosphate was used as another basic sodium salt. The catalysts thus prepared were found to be much more active and selective than the previous catalyst prepared by employing sodium carbonate. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis results indicate that the effective zirconium compounds are not pre- sent as zirconium oxides, but as sodium zirconium phosphates. tion (P/Zr ratio is half of the Na/Zr ratio). The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The oxidative coupling reaction and the product analysis were performed by the same procedure as described in the previous paper [7]. The reaction was carried out under atmospheric pressure at the reaction temperature of 1023 K with the methane partial pres- sure (Pcn4) of 16.5 kPa and the oxygen partial pres- sure (Po~.) of 8.3 kPa (CH4/O2=2); the total gas flow rate was 100 cm3 (NTP)/min and the catalyst loading was 2.0 g, 3. Results 2. Experimental 3.1. Catalytic performance The catalysts were prepared by the following procedure. A 10 wt% aqueous solution of sodium pyrophosphate (Na4P207-10H20, Shinyo Pure Che- micals, 99+%) having a pH of ca. 10 was added dropwise under stirring to a 10 wt% aqueous solution of zirconyl chloride (ZrOCI2.8H20, Junsei Chemical, Chemical Pure Grade) having a pH of 0.5. A pre- cipitate was formed in the resulting mixture; the amount of the precipitate became larger as the ratio of sodium pyrophosphate/zirconyl chloride increased. Without filtering out the precipitate from the liquid, the water in the mixture was evaporated by heating under stirring until a thick paste was formed. This mixture was dried at 393 K, calcined in air at 1073 K for 2 h, and then crushed to 40-80 mesh particle sizes. Each catalyst was designated as P-,, being the Na/Zr mole ratio employed in the prepara- Table 1 Results of the reaction over the catalysts with varying composition The results of the reaction performed over the catalysts with different composition at an initial time-on-stream of 70 min are presented in Table 1. Noticeable features for the catalytic performance of the catalysts as a whole are high C2+ yields with high methane conversions, high ethene/ethane ratios and high C34 selectivities. It has been reported that even for the highly active and selective catalysts the C2+ yield rarely exceeds 25% [3], and it has also been suggested that for a good catalyst the sum of methane conversion and C2+ selectivity (in %) is equal to or greater than 80 [4]; therefore, most of the catalysts in this work can be said to be highly active and selective. The ethene/ethane ratio greater than 10 and the C3+C4 selectivity in Table 1 are also quite high compared with those of the catalysts which appear in review articles and other studies [3-7].

K.J. Yoon, S.W. Seo/Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) L5-LIO L7 In most cases, two or three kinds of C3 compounds were observed, but they were not always unambigu- ously identified by the GC. When three kinds were detected, it was certain that they were propene, propane and a third kind of C3 compound, respectively, and the amount of propene or the third compound was usually larger than that of propane. From an analysis of the products by using a GC column packed with 23% SP-1700 on 80/100 Chromosorb PAW (Supelco Inc.), the third C3 com- pound is considered to be propadiene tentatively; it does not seem to be propyne or cyclopropane. When two kinds were detected, one was propene or propane and the other was the third compound, but it is considered that the former would more probably be propene. When only one compound was detected, it was the third compound or considered to be propene. A similar situation occurred for the C4 compounds with more ambiguity than for C3, and the C4 compounds were considered to be butene(s) and butane(s). Due to this ambiguity, the amounts of C3 and C4 were calculated by using the TCD response factors for propene and n-butane as representing C3 and C4, respectively, when the identification was uncertain. The catalytic performance depended on the ratio of sodium pyrophosphate/zirconyl chloride used in the preparation, as shown in Table 1. P-0.6 appeared to be the most active, but this activity lasted only about 2 h, as shown in Fig. 1. The C2+ selectivity over P-0.6 also dropped rapidly after about 4 h on-stream. P-2.4 and P-9.2 catalysts were more stable than P-0.6, and their C2+ selectivity slightly decreased in the course of the time period investigated. P-2.4 showed higher activity and C2+ yield but lower C2+ selectivity than P-9.2. The activities and selectivities of P-I.1 and P-5.4 with time on-stream (not shown in Fig. 1 for briefness) were in-between those of P-0.6 and P-2.4 and of P-2.4 and P-9.2, respectively. Overall, P-9.2 showed the highest C2~ selectivity and P-2.4 showed the highest methane conversion and C2+ yield. The change of C2+ product distribution for P-2.4 with time on-stream is shown in Fig. 2. The selectivities for ethene, C3 and C4 gradually decreased with time on-stream, while only the selectivity of ethane increased. Similar changes of the product distribution were observed for P-5.4 and P-9.2. 100 80 / (5.9) (2.3) (1.2) 6o o \"- \"~0.16) 8 4o 2O 0 2 4 6 8 10 Time on-stream (h) Fig. 1.

For the flesh samples, the catalysts prepared with low NaJZr ratios showed the presence of well-developed tetragonal zirconia and a smaller amount of mono- clinic zirconia, while the ones with high Na/Zr ratios showed the presence of sodium zirconium phosphates and unidentified phases but no or small amounts of the crystalline zirconia. Zirconia can be formed by decomposition of zirconyl chloride upon calcination [7]. As it has been reported that zirconium phosphate gel is readily formed from zirconyl chloride and phosphoric acid [9-12], the precipitate formed in the mixture would mostly be zirconium phosphates or zirconium pyrophosphate, and a part of it may be zirconium hydroxide formed from zirconyl chloride in contact with the basic solution [7,13].

Hexagonal (or rhombohedral) NaZr2(PO4)3 was observed in P-0.6, P-1.1 and P-2.4, and Na2Zr(PO4)2 was observed in the fresh P-5.4; they were considered to be formed from the zirconium phosphate gel and sodium during cal- cination. In P-5.4 and P-9.2, NaZr2(PO4)3 was not observed, but unidentified phases were observed. Although the unidentified phases did not match satis- factorily with any compounds in the JDPDS powder diffraction files, some of the peaks appeared close, with some deviations in the d values and intensity ratios, to such compounds as Na2Zr(PO4)2 in the used P-I.1, in the used P-2.4, in the used P-5.4 and in the fresh P-9.2; such as Na5Zr(PO4)3 in the used P-5.4 and Na4P206 in the fresh P-9.2 (these are parenthesized in Table 2). The other unidentified peaks may be con- sidered to come from various sodium phosphate com- pounds or poorly crystallized phases. As the Na/Zr (or P/Zr) ratio increases, it appears that the formation of Na2Zr(PO4)2 becomes preferred to the formation of NaZr2(PO4)3. For some of the used samples, the amount of the monoclinic zirconia was larger than that of tetragonal zirconia. This is due to the phase transformation as has been observed by Sohn et al. [13], who have reported that the tetragonal phase is preferentially formed in the presence of the phosphate group but is gradually transformed to the more stable monoclinic phase at sufficiently high temperatures. It was also noted that NaZr2(PO4)3 seemed to be gradually transformed to Na2Zr(PO4)2 and then to NasZr(PO4)3 during reaction [141. The amount of NaC1 appeared to become larger with the Na/Zr ratio and then nearly constant above the Na/Zr ratio of 2.4. This indicates that sodium ions and chlorine ions in the mixture form NaC1 stoichiome- trically. By comparing the fresh catalysts with the used ones, we note that NaC1 disappears during the reaction.

Discussion The XRD results indicate that the catalytically active substances are NaCl-promoted sodium zirco- nium phosphates and zirconia. However, the results of the reaction experiments, when combined with the XRD results, suggest that NaZr2(PO4)3 and Na2Zr(PO4)2 are very likely to be the most effective components among those zirconium compounds. It is certain that NaC1 is the key promoter in the catalyst system because the activity and selectivity decreased with the decrease of NaCI (Table 2 and Fig. 1); similar observation has been reported in earlier works [5-7]. Since the catalysts in this work showed much higher activity and selectivity than the NaCl-promoted zir- conia in the earlier works, the contribution of the NaCl-promoted zirconia to the performance of the catalysts in this work is considered minor. It may be speculated that the initial high activities and selectiv- ities exhibited by the catalysts having low Na/Zr ratios are mainly owing to the presence of small amounts of the NaCl-promoted sodium zirconium phosphates, even though their presence was not observed by the XRD analysis; the rapid deactivation of these catalysts may be rapid disappearance or transformation of the active substances. The decrease of activity with the Na/Zr ratio for the fresh catalysts having high Na/Zr ratios (Table 1) would be due to masking of the sur- face with the excess sodium pyrophosphate. Although the transformations of the crystalline zirconias and sodium zirconium phosphates were observed, it is at present hard to tell whether these are directly related to the changes of the catalytic performance. It is generally accepted in the OCM that ethane is the primary product formed by dimerization of methyl radicals and ethene is formed from ethane by catalytic and/or gas phase dehydrogenation [1--4]. If the ethene formation occurs only in the gas phase, the ethene/ ethane ratio will remain constant as long as the activity is constant. In this catalyst system, however, the decrease of the ethene/ethane ratio with time on- stream in spite of' the relatively constant activity, as observed in Figs. 1 and 2 for P-2.4 and P-9.2 for some hours, suggests that the ethene is formed mainly on the catalyst surface, The high ethene/ethane ratio is con- sidered due to the presence of chlorine, as has been observed from chloride-promoted transition metal oxides [15-18]. The role of chlorine may lie in suitably modifying the catalyst surface and in promot- ing gas phase reactions to give high ethene/ethane ratios [4]. The decrease of the ethene/ethane ratio under the constant activity also suggests that there are at least two kinds of active sites; one is only capable of activating ethane and the other is capable of activating both methane and ethane [ 19,20]. The previous study on the NaCI-promoted ZrO2 catalyst has suggested that the former kind of site is related to the chlorine bound to zirconium and the latter to the chlorine bound to sodium [7]. The former kind of chlorine disappears more rapidly than the latter, and this could explain the relatively rapid decrease of the ethene/ethane ratio, compared to the activity decrease. As the catalysts in this work also contain NaC1 and zirconium compounds, the same explanation could be applied for the kinds of active sites. The catalysts in this work showed high yields of C3 and C4 compounds. This is considered to be a salient feature of the NaCl-promoted sodium zirconium phos- phate catalyst. At the moment, however, there is not much to say about the main reaction paths for the formation of these compounds; diverse paths may be proposed. For example, propene could be formed by rapid dehydrogenation of propane which has been formed from the methyl and ethyl radicals, or be formed from the methyl radical and ethene which is more abundant than ethane in this reaction system. Further work will be needed for the elucidation of the reaction paths of C~ and Ca compounds. 5. Conclusions The catalysts prepared from zirconyl chloride and sodium pyrophosphate exhibited high activity and selectivity for the oxidative coupling of methane. The activity and selectivity depended on the ratio of sodium pyrophosphate/zirconyl chloride employed. The highest C2+ selectivity was 79% at the methane conversion of 28% (C2+ yield 22%), and the highest C2+ yield was about 30% with the C2+ selectivity of 66-70%. The ethene/ethane ratio higher than 10 and the C3+ selectivity of about 10-20% were obtained during early time on-stream. Over the catalysts with the Na/Zr ratio greater than about 2, the C2+ selectiv- ity did not decrease much, in spite of the significant decrease of the activity. The catalytically active L10 K.J. Yoon, S.I,V Seo/Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997)L5-LIO substances are most likely to be NaCl-promoted sodium zirconium phosphates (NaZr2(PO4)3 and Na2Zr(PO4)2), and NaC1 plays a key role in activity and selectivity of the catalyst system. The catalyst deactivation is most probably due to the disappearance of NaC1.

The highest C2+ selectivity was 79% at the methane conversion of 28% (C2+ yield 22%) and the highest C2+ yield was about 30% with the C2+ selectivity of 66–70% at the methane conversion of 41–44%. The ethene/ethane ratio higher than 10 and the C3+ selectivity of about 10–20% were obtained. Over the catalysts with the Na/Zr ratio greater than about 2, the C2+ selectivity did not decrease much with time on-stream in spite of the significant decrease of the activity. The main reason for the catalyst deactivation is probably the disappearance of NaCl.
