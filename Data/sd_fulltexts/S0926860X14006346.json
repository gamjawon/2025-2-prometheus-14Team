Graphical abstract This short review concerns the efficient catalysts for HC-SCR discovered more than 20 years ago. In 1990, Iwamoto proposed Cu ion-exchanged ZSM-5, and it was the first powerful catalyst for HC-SCR. This paper presents first metal ion-exchanged zeolites and the influence of various parameters on the catalysts activities (acidity, O2 content, etc.). In the second part, this paper reviews supported metal catalysts, base metal oxides, hybrid catalysts and the possible reducing agents to remove NO x . It can be inferred that the most active catalysts for HC-SCR should have acidic sites, an active phase like copper or cobalt, or for a wider activity, elements such as silver or a mixture of metals. For low deactivation, they should contain noble metals such as platinum, rhodium or tin. Keywords HC-SCR NO x Reduction by hydrocarbons Minireview. 1 Introduction Large quantities of pollutants are released to the environment from the combustion of biomass and fossil fuels. Among these contaminants are nitrogen oxides (NO x ) which are the source of severe environmental problems. Research in the field of NO x abatement has grown significantly in the last two decades [1]. The general approach has focused on developing new catalysts with complex materials in order to meet the stringent environmental regulations. Nowadays, two main methods for the removal of NO x from emission gases are employed: the selective catalytic reduction of NO x with NH3 (ammonia-SCR) which is applied for stationary sources such as power plants, and the three-way catalysts (TWC) used for mobile sources, such as automobiles [2]. In spite of the intense research in this former, the outcomes present partial solutions and include serious drawbacks for ammonia-SCR. Alternatively, selective catalytic reduction of NO x using hydrocarbons as a reductant (HC-SCR) is currently attracting a great deal of interest because of the main advantage of the use of a gas mixture very similar to that found in exhausts. The aim of this review is to gain knowledge on the selective catalytic reduction of NO x with hydrocarbons in order to contribute to the development of suitable catalysts for NO x abatement. This review discusses briefly the sources, the emission levels of NO x , their influence on the environment and on public health, and their regulation and above all, it focuses on the efficient catalytic materials for selective reduction of NO x using hydrocarbons. 2 Effects, sources, legislation of NO x and the advantages of HC-SCR The abbreviation NO x usually relates to nitrogen monoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which are produced during combustion at high temperatures. NO is the most important nitrogen–oxygen product of combustion, but it is further oxidized to NO2. NO x from engine exhaust typically consists of a mixture of about 95% NO and 5% NO2 [1]. The toxicity of NO on human health would be four times lower than the toxicity of NO2. However, in the presence of oxygen, NO is quickly oxidized into NO2 which is a potent pulmonary irritant that can cause severe burns when in contact with the skin or the eyes. Gaseous NO2 is associated with adverse effects on health, and its presence of it in high concentrations causes inflammation of the airways and reduced lung function [2]. Moreover, NO x contribute to acid deposition, eutrophication as well as the formation of secondary inorganic particulate matter and tropospheric O3 [2]. Anthropogenic activity is the main source of NO x emissions, while biogenic sources constitute only a small fraction [1]. NO x are emitted during fuel combustion, of industrial facilities and road transport sector. The major source of NO x is the combustion of fossil fuels [1]. The origin of NO x is generally categorized into mobile and stationary sources as described in Fig. 1 [3]. Among the countries of the European Union [4,5], the three largest countries emitting NO x in 2010 with more than 1000kT/year were Germany, France and the UK (Table 1 ). NO x emissions continue to pose the greatest challenge, with 11 Member States (two of the three largest emitters) exceeding their respective NO x ceilings for 2010. Regulations have been proposed by the European Parliament to control NO x emissions from stationary plants; National Emission Ceilings “NEC” Directive (Directive 2001/81/EC) sets upper limits for each Member State for the total emissions in 2010 of four pollutants among them nitrogen oxides (Table 1) to reduce acidiﬁcation, eutrophication and the effect of ozone. Updated information related to pollutant emissions could be obtained by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and in the European Pollutant Emission Register (EPER) which is the first Europe-wide register of emissions into air and water from large- and medium-sized industrial facilities [4]. Other directives concerning industrial and agricultural activities include limits for NO x emissions (such as Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control “IPPC” (Directive 2008/1/EC) and Large Combustion Plants (Directive 01/80/EC)). With regard to emissions from mobile sources, the Euro V and Euro VI standards limit the reduction of NO x from light vehicles. The first standard limits the NO x emission to less than 180mg/km for diesel and 60mg/km for petrol-driven engines. In Euro VI, an additional reduction of more than 50% compared to Euro V standard will be applied. Other programs have been designed in the United States to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides from power plants, notably the Acid Rain Program (ARP) and the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) which contributed to significant NO x reductions (Table 2 ). From 1990 to 2012, annual NO x emissions in CAIR and ARP units together dropped by about 4700–1700kT, a decrease of 73% [6]. Moreover, in Japan, NO x emissions in Fiscal Year 2010 (FY2010) were 1744kT. They decreased by 14.6% since FY1990 and decreased by 1.9% compared to the year 2009 [7]. From a thermodynamic point of view, the NO molecule is unstable even at 298K and 1atm. Even though NO formation is an endothermic phenomenon, no decomposition is observed at 825K. This is due to the electronic structure of the bond in NO. However, the reaction is spin-forbidden, and NO is therefore kinetically stable. Thus, the high thermal stability of nitric oxide is due to its high energy of dissociation (364kJmol−1) and to corresponding extremely low decomposition rates. Therefore, a catalyst is needed to lower the activation energy in order to facilitate the decomposition. Research in this domain is extensive and can be divided into two major paths of deNO x activities based on automobile and stationary sources, either in the presence or absence of a reducing agent. There are advantages of NO x reduction by a reducing agent. In the presence of a reductant, reactions induce a strong decrease in the Gibbs free energy values. Furthermore, the introduction of oxygen involves an additional reduction in the free energy. This explains that such reactions are used in practical applications. As ammonia reductant has a lot of drawbacks, and the SCR of NO x by hydrocarbons (HC) seems to be the most promising way to eliminate NO x . Moreover, the main advantage is the use of a gas mixture very similar to that found in exhausts. In fact, combustion processes lead to NO x and HC exhausts which are both controlled pollutants. Some researchers studied the mechanism of NO x reduction by hydrocarbons [8]. In this process, the selective reaction of NO to N2 initially proceeds by the simultaneous oxidation of NO to surface nitrates as strong oxidants and oxidation of hydrocarbons to surface oxygenates, followed by the reaction between these surface intermediates that leads to the formation of NCO and CN species, and finally induce the formation of N2 and CO2 via the oxidation or the hydrolysis of these nitrogen-containing species. Powerful catalysts for selective catalytic reduction of NO x by HC are important to discover. In 1990, Iwamoto [10] proposed the first powerful catalyst for HC-SCR, Cu ion-exchanged ZSM-5, since metal ion-exchanged zeolites have been the most investigated class of catalysts. 3 Powerful catalysts for selective catalytic reduction of NO x by HC 3.1 Metal ion-exchanged zeolites Table 3 presents various zeolite catalysts cited in the literature. The table is divided into catalyst, conditions (composition of gas mixture) and NO reduction efficiency. More specific information can be found in the literature. 3.1.1 Influence of the zeolite structure and its acidity The three main zeolite types studied for more than 20 years are FER, MFI and MOR [9]. Indeed, Iwamoto et al. [10] studied the activity for SCR with C2H4 and observed the activity order as follow: Cu-MFI>Cu-MOR=Cu-FER>Cu-Y. The authors explained the best activity of Cu-MFI by the MFI structure that is more favorable for the reduction of NO in the presence of C2 hydrocarbons. Halasz et al. [11] indicated that the bridging of the hydroxyl groups of the MFI structure probably constitute active sites for the oxidation of NO by O2 to surface nitrates. Similar trends for Ce-exchanged zeolites are also found by Yokoyama and Misono [12]. However, Corma et al. [13] proved that Cu-exchanged beta zeolites exhibited similar activities compared to Cu-exchanged MFI zeolites for SCR with C3H8. In addition, the same team [14] proposed that the adequate zeolitic catalyst for SCR of NO with propane should (i) have a medium pore with 10- or 12-member ring channels, (ii) have no cavities and (iii) contain exchanged metal ions. They proposed a new zeolite structure: ITQ 27 with 12-ring pore dimension, 6.94Å×6.20Å that showed a high activity for SCR with propane of this Co-exchanged zeolite. However, the best zeolite structure also seems to depend on the hydrocarbon reductant (especially its acido-basicity and dimension). The catalytic behaviors often depend on the Si/Al ratios and for this “adequate zeolitic catalyst”: Si/Al ratio=8–35 [14]. Nevertheless, Al atoms are not always needed because dealuminated Cu-exchanged SiBEA prepared by Dzwigaj et al. were active for SCR by EtOH [15]. Moreover, the related acid sites of the zeolites have an important role in the reaction. Many papers are directly based on the acido-basicity behaviors of HC-SCR [16,17]. Szanyi and Paffett [18] explained the role of the acid sites by the use of an in situ FT-IR investigation of the NO with O2 reaction. Acid sites would nucleate NO by the formation of N x O y species (not strongly bonded) leading to surface nitrates. All studies showed that the activity and the selectivity depend on the presence of acidic sites in the zeolites; both Brønsted and/or Lewis sites are important. Their amount and strength depend on the Si/Al atomic ratio. Bartolomeu et al. [19] showed that, on the one hand, the ability of the HY zeolites to oxidize the HC and, on the other hand, the amounts of NO x converted into N2, depend on the availability and strength of acid sites (Brønsted and Lewis) on the different zeolites through their Si/Al range. Zeolites with the most acidic sites have the best oxidizing properties. Moreover, acid sites participate in the dissociation of NO to N2 and are also expected to be involved in some crucial steps of the DeNO x mechanism, such as the NO oxidation to NO2, and/or the secondary reactions of the trapped HC with the NO2 formed. However, the H-zeolites studied are always not active enough and too water-sensitive. 3.1.2 Influence of the preparation procedures Charjar et al. [20] prepared Cu-ZSM-5 according to three different procedures: exchange (ex), impregnation (imp) and precipitation (prec); the samples were then tested for their activity to SCR by propane. They obtained the following activity order: Cu-ZSM-5(ex)>Cu-ZSM-5 (imp)>Cu-ZSM-5 (prec) and concluded that the ion exchange is the best technique to prepare metal zeolites for this reaction. However, Wang et al. [21] prepared Co/MFI catalysts with Co/Al=1 by sublimation of CoCl2 and CoBr2 onto H/MFI. The preparation of Co/MFI catalysts by sublimation of CoBr2 produces an equally active but more stable catalyst than sublimation of CoCl2. The higher vapor pressure of CoBr2 resulted in a lower temperature requirement (600°C instead of 700°C) during catalyst preparation. As a consequence, the zeolite structure remains intact. They showed that those solids are more active for SCR with CH4 in a dry feed for a temperature below 450°C than wet-ion exchange. They also used other preparation methods such as solid-state ion exchange and impregnation but they obtained less powerful catalysts. The procedure through which the metal is implanted in the zeolite lattice is then an important factor because the metal is not always totally directly bonded on the exchangeable positions. The higher activity below 450°C for the Co/MFI catalysts prepared by sublimation would be due to multinuclear Co oxo-ions. The chemisorption of NO x species would be faster on the multinuclear Co oxo-ions than on Co3O4 particles and isolated Co cations and then the rate could be correlated with the catalyst performance in NO x reduction. Moreover, a recent study by Boutros et al. [22] showed the influence of synthesis parameters on the simultaneous reduction of NO x and combustion of CH4. A highest DeNO x activity was obtained with catalysts synthesized by means of incipient wetness impregnation using an ammine palladium precursor, while the catalyst prepared by means of ion-exchange showed a higher activity in methane combustion [22]. The higher activity of Pd-SBA-Imp is due to a better dispersion of PdO active phase located inside the pores of the silica support and to a relative stronger interaction between the active phase and the support. 3.1.3 Influence of the metal nature and its loading The nature of the cations in these catalysts is prominent because cations are the active species in the reduction by HC. Cu and Co exchanged zeolites are widely studied due to their activity and selectivity for SCR even though conditions such as the reductant chosen and the presence of oxygen in the feed affect their catalytic activity. Fig. 2 presents the NO x conversion over Cu or Co-ZSM-5 with CH4 (1000ppm) and/or C3H6 (550ppm) and/or O2 (2.5%) [23]. The presence of O2 is essential to the reaction. Under oxidizing conditions, Co-ZSM-5 zeolite is an active catalyst for reduction with methane, whereas Cu-ZSM-5 zeolite is almost inactive. However, both catalysts are very active in the presence of O2 and C3H6. Therefore, under oxidizing conditions, Cu but also Ce-exchanged zeolites [10] are active catalysts in the presence of HC with more than two carbons, whereas other metals like Co, Mn, Fe, Ni, Ga or In exhibit also activity in the reduction with methane and ethane. Among those metals, Mn and Ni exchanged zeolites do not offer advantages over Co, since N2O is a main product [24]. A special attention is devoted to Fe-zeolite catalysts in SCR for their good activity (Table 3), although CO production is high [25,26]. Ga and especially In-exchanged zeolites [27] are very selective and active in the presence of water for SCR but the maximum of NO conversion is reached at high temperatures (500°C). Kikuchi and Yogo [28] showed the importance of In-exchanged zeolites in HC-SCR, presenting especially in wet feed, high activity with NO2 reduction. Among the platinum group metals, Pt and Pd were widely studied for SCR but they are found to be not very efficient. In fact, Pt is efficient only at low temperatures and N2O is its main product [29], Pd is often less active than Cu- or Co-exchanged zeolites and Rh is limited to reducing atmosphere as in the case of three-way catalysts. However, as these exchanged zeolites are more stable by adding H2O and SO2 in the feed than other metals, they are widely studied. Ag zeolites are promising catalysts with high performances for NO x reduction, especially with NO2 [30] and with addition of small amounts of H2 in the flow. This can be observed (Fig. 3 ) with the conversions over Ag-zeolites for C3H8-SCR in the presence of O2 and in the absence or presence of 0.5% H2 at 300°C [31]. 3.1.4 Effect of the degree of exchange The degree of exchange is a significant parameter for activity. For Cu, Ce and Co ions [32], the activity for SCR of NO reaches a maximum of 80–100% but a small decrease occurs for higher levels of those metals. Stakheev et al. [33] found that the optimal metal loading for Co-ZSM5 should be correlated with the Al content. They showed that the activity increases with Co content for Co/Al<0.5 and decreases for a ratio of Co/Al>0.5. This result was also confirmed by Shibata et al. [31] who observed that the amount of Ag n δ+ clusters increases with Ag/Al ratio till 0.5 and that the Ag n δ+ clusters in Ag-MFI catalysts should be responsible of the SCR of NO by C3H8. The effect of the degree of exchange on catalysts activity was then discussed for Ag-MFI from the viewpoint of active Ag species (Ag+ ion, Ag n δ+ clusters (2≤ n ≤4), metallic Ag m clusters (3≤ m ≤5), and Ag metal), whereas the difference of activity for ferrierite containing Co2+ exchanged was interpreted as a consequence of the preference of the cations for 8-ring channel sites first and for 10-ring channel sites later. 3.1.5 Supported zeolites containing two different elements For zeolites containing Cu or Co as their main components, a high number of other metals were tested and among them, only Ce and La [34] added to Cu, earth-alkaline metals to Co [33] and Pd to Co [35,36] seem to exhibit some interesting effect. The addition of earth-alkaline metals was found to be effective for Co-MFI zeolites in the SCR of NO with propane. However, no clear evidence has been given about the elements facilitating the second element, particularly what is the contribution in the redox process, in the activation of the reactants or in the scavenging of the products. Nevertheless, the Co–Pd combination supported on zeolite leads to very active and selective catalysts for the SCR of nitrogen oxides with methane or methanol in the presence of oxygen and water. In this case, the activity would be correlated to well-dispersed Pd (ions) inside the zeolite pores that activate the reductant and to the presence of cobalt (Co3O4, Co-oxo ions) that enhances the SCR activity by oxidizing NO to NO2. 3.1.6 Influence of the nature of the reductant The N2 yields of NO x reduction depend on the nature of the reductant, for example, Co/MFI catalysts [21] present selectivities of 100% with iso-butane and only of 30% with methane. Moreover, since natural gas (containing more than 90% of CH4) is widely used as a fuel source, many researches use CH4 as a reductant even if its activation is difficult [22,37,38]. Matsumoto et al. [39] indicated that, irrespective of the C number, olefins are much more effective than paraffins. Witzel et al. [40] studied the effect of the nature of the HC on the NO conversion on Co/Na-ZSM-5 by the use of saturated HC with lesser reactivity i-C4H10 >n-C5H12 >2,2,4-tri-methylpentane>neo-C5H12 >3,3-dimethylpentane>methane>C3H8 >3,3-diethylpentane (neononane). They showed the existence of a strong molecular sieve effect for the SCR reaction with hydrocarbons too bulky to enter the zeolite pores (like neononane) but not for their oxidation. However, in another study, the inverse case [9] is observed because on Fe-MFI, NO should be into the pores with Fe to be transformed to NO2 whereas the hydrocarbon had to stay outside the porous structure, otherwise it would directly be oxidized. The activity of oxygenated VOC like alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and ethers is found to be close to that of propene [41]. Therefore, many new works mention the use of ethanol as a reductant [15,42]. Moreover, Iliopoulou et al. [43] showed on Ag catalysts that the use of higher and less saturated hydrocarbons results in an enhanced deNO x performance. They explained that NO x is reduced by reacting with intermediates generated from partial oxidation of hydrocarbons used as reductants and that increased availability of these species either by more C atoms in higher hydrocarbons, their easier formation from less saturated hydrocarbons explains the improvement of NO x reduction. 3.1.7 Influence of oxygen content The SCR of NO by propene with an oxygen excess over Cu-ZSM-5 produces hydrogen cyanide at T <400°C [44]. IR data by Lombardo et al. [37] showed, in the same conditions, the presence of HCN, NH3 and HNCO. Moreover, a maximum selectivity is generally obtained for O2/HC ratio sufficient for total combustion of the hydrocarbon. d’Itri and Sachtler [45] studied the combined effects of O2 and C3H8 on N2 yield (773K, 4000ppm NO, 4000ppm C3H8) and showed that after a maximum of about 2% of oxygen, the N2 yield decreases. 3.1.8 Stability of metal-exchanged zeolites All zeolite-based catalysts are very sensitive to water and quickly deactivate. This is mainly due to two effects [46]: • the modification of the geometry of the metallic active sites namely of their coordination and of their position on the zeolite; • the dealumination of the structure with a modification of the Brønsted acidity. Therefore, even though the activity is about three times lower compared to Cu-ZSM-5, Pt-ZSM-5 is less affected by H2O and SO2 [47] and then is often studied. The very low sintering of the Pt particles could explain the stability of the catalyst. A high stability to steam [27] is also observed for In-ZSM-5. In fact, a low effect on the indium sites is found by the poisoning of In-ZSM-5 zeolites by water because the phenomenon is reversible. The initial activity can be restored when water is put out of the feed. This can be explained by the fact that H2O is very likely to be preferentially adsorbed on acid aluminum sites and separate In2O3 particles can promote NO2 formation particularly in wet conditions. The implanting of cobalt in the beta zeolite structure was reported by Armor and Farris [48] to be also less sensitive to water than the classical exchanged one. Moreover, a deactivation study of Co–Pd-zeolites [35] showed that MOR zeolite topology is the most appropriate for Pd and Co. 3.1.9 Other molecular sieves used in the SCR of NO In order to increase the stability in the presence of water, Inui et al. [49] investigated the activity of MFI and beta-metallosilicate catalysts (H-Fe, H-Co, etc.) and they showed that: the metal loading, the nature of the reductant, the acidity and the oxygen content have the same influence as in metal-exchanged zeolites; the best activities are obtained with both average acidity and activity in the oxidation of HC; the beta and MFI type structures exhibit a high thermal and SO2 resistance, but carbonaceous deposits are found [50] and these deposits increase with water content. Transition metals supported on mesoporous silica molecular sieves for HC-SCR have been first studied with MCM-41 due to their low acidity and hydrothermal stability. Indeed, platinum supported on mesoporous silica and metal-substituted silicates exhibited high NO conversions below 200°C [51]. The activity is related to support acidity, which is affected by metal substitution of the silicates. The increase in Brønsted acidity of the supports resulted in the low-temperature activity of the catalyst. Nevertheless, new results on more stable SBA15 with Co for CH4-SCR of NO2 [52] are showed to be interesting but especially with Ag/Al-SBA15 system [53] which exhibits interesting activity for EtOH-SCR of NO. 3.2 Base oxides and supported metal catalysts The activity of various base oxides and supported metal catalysts for HC-SCR is shown in Table 4 . 4 Influence of the support The base oxides (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, CoO, ZrO2, etc.) have a very low or even have no activity for SCR of NO in the presence of the most active reductants (C2H4 or C3H6) [54,55]; only Al2O3 and superacid SO4 2−/TiO2 SO4 2−/ZrO2 present some activity due to their acid sites. However, as Al2O3 has mainly Lewis acid sites, while SO4 2−/TiO2 has mainly Brønsted sites, the activity for SCR of NO x of these oxides does not simply depend on the type of acidity. Kourieh et al. studied the correlation between the catalytic behavior and the samples surface acidity for the SCR of NO x by n-decane over different catalytic systems consisting of zirconia mixed oxides with Me2O3 (Me: B, Al, Ga, In, W) and showed that the samples with moderate acidity are the most active and selective towards N2, because too strong acid sites favor the oxidation of the hydrocarbons that cannot react anymore as a reducing agent [56]. 4.1.1 Influence of metal oxides deposition Only Cu, Co, Fe and Sn on Al2O3 exhibit an increasing of the activity and similar influence of the metal loading is obtained for metal exchanged zeolites [55,57]. Indeed, a comparison of the catalytic behavior for SCR of NO by C2H4 of transition metal ions in ZSM-5 and in Al2O3 showed that the catalytic properties are dictated more by the chemical nature of the metal ions and less by the nature of the support [55]. Tabata et al. [57], using methanol as a reductant, reported also that the addition of Sn led to an important enhancement of the activity of alumina, especially in the low-temperature range (T <625K) and led to a certain durability of the catalyst in the presence of water and SO2. The authors suggested that the effect of the addition of Sn was related to the promotion of a reaction step leading to the formation of N2 and CO x . 4.1.2 Influence of platinum group metals deposition Noble metals investigation is due to the low stability of other metals. Among them, Pt and Rh seem to be better than other metals, especially against deactivation. However, they must also be preferentially deposited on Al2O3 for the same reason as metal oxides. Indeed, Hamada et al. [58] reported a cooperative effect between platinum and alumina in the reaction of NO with propane. Other studies by Obuchi et al. [59] reported that, for the same reductant, there is a relationship between the activity and the nature of the platinum metal. At low temperatures (about 525K), platinum catalysts present higher activities than other platinum group metals, while at 625K their activity is inferior to that of Rh-Al2O3. In all temperature ranges, the activity of Ir or Pd on the same support is lower than Pt or Rh catalysts. However, N2O is mainly formed on Pt (only one-third of the NO is converted into nitrogen) [60], whereas more than 90% of the NO consumed is converted into N2 on Rh-supported catalysts. Moreover, Kim et al. investigated the effect of impregnating Pt on different Al2O3 phases (α-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3) for the SCR of NO x by CH4 and showed that also a good activity is obtained while mixing by mortar the two catalysts [61]. 4.1.3 Influence of the deposition of other noble metals Nano-sized Au/Al2O3 catalyst was found to have some interesting activity for HC-SCR [62] but Ag/Al2O3 was found to be one of the most active and selective catalysts with a wide operating window for the SCR of NO x [63–65]. Moreover, Kim et al. [66] studied Ag/Al2O3 in hard conditions (400ppm NO, simulated diesel, 800ppm EtOH, 6% O2, 2.5% H2O), even though high performances are still obtained for NO x reduction. Therefore, the catalyst of choice has to perform well over a wide range of temperatures, under different reactant mixtures and has low sensitivity toward deactivation. Therefore, a combination of different metals and/or of different catalysts seems to be the better choice. That is why a great interest is increasingly given to hybrid catalysts. 4.2 Hybrid catalysts Activities of various hybrid catalysts for the selective catalytic reduction of NO are shown in Table 5 . The combination of different metals is found, for example, in the reduction of NO x by CH4 on Pd-sulfated CeZrO2 [67] and those materials present interesting catalytic behavior. However, the combination of different catalysts seems to be more powerful since the mixture of Mn2O3, SnO2 and H-BEA for SCR of NO x by propane [68], or the mixture of MO x (M=Ce, Mn) and Au/TiO2 for SCR of NO x by propene [69] present almost ideal performances. For instance, a shift of 100°C towards lower temperatures and a wider window of activity are obtained when Mn2O3 is added to Au/TiO2 in comparison with Au/TiO2 alone. Other interesting combination catalysts can be observed through “dual bed configuration” with Ag/Al2O3 and Cu-ZSM-5 catalysts [70] used one after the other. Another study [71] have shown the interest of mixing Ag/Al2O3 with M-ZSM-5 (M: W, In, Ba, Ga) for NO x reduction with decane, the highest NO x conversion was obtained with Ag/Al2O3 mixed with Ba-ZSM-5. NO x storage reduction by the use of mixture or dual bed configuration [72] over hybrid Pt–Ba/Al2O3 and Fe-ZSM-5 systems is particularly efficient for NO x removal. 5 Conclusion HC-SCR is an interesting way for NO x reduction and during this last two decades many efficient catalysts were investigated, especially metal ion-exchanged zeolites. The catalyst of choice for HC-SCR would be rather a combination of different metals (with Co, Ag, Pd, etc.) and/or of different mixed catalysts to perform well over a wide range of temperatures and reactant mixtures and without any significant deactivation. In conclusion, an active and selective catalyst for HC-SCR needs some acidity from the support, an adequate active phase (like Cu or Co), silver (or a mixture of metals) for a wide range of efficiency and, for low sensitivity toward deactivation, Sn or some noble metals could be useful. Furthermore, articles are trying increasingly to explain how to remove simultaneously the NO x and the HC (VOC) [60,72–76], whereas single catalyst should be able to destroy directly both NO x and VOCs.

        "dc:description": "This short review concerns the efficient catalysts for HC-SCR discovered more than 20 years ago. In 1990, Iwamoto proposed Cu ion-exchanged ZSM-5, and it was the first powerful catalyst for HC-SCR. This paper presents first metal ion-exchanged zeolites and the influence of various parameters on the catalysts activities (acidity, O2 content, etc.). In the second part, this paper reviews supported metal catalysts, base metal oxides, hybrid catalysts and the possible reducing agents to remove NO x . It can be inferred that the most active catalysts for HC-SCR should have acidic sites, an active phase like copper or cobalt, or for a wider activity, elements such as silver or a mixture of metals. For low deactivation, they should contain noble metals such as platinum, rhodium or tin.",
