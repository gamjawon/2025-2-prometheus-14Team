Constructing heterojunction is a good method to improve electrocatalytic activity because the heterojunctions can modulate the Fermi level and redistribute charges of the catalysts to accelerate electron transfer. In this study, Ni3S2 nanocones were prepared on nickel foam (NF) by hydrothermal synthesis, and FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 Schottky heterojunctions were constructed by electrodeposition of FeCoNi LDH nanosheets onto Ni3S2 nanocones. Electrochemical results demonstrate that FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF is an efficient alkaline OER catalyst, the overpotential is 216 mV at 100 mA cm-2, and it can maintain stable operation for 110 h. The battery voltage of the dual-electrode structure composed of FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF and NF at 1 M KOH is 1.61 V at 10 mA cm-2. The results of XPS show that the FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 Schottky heterojunction optimizes the electronic structure of the interface, accelerating electron transfer. Additionally, the enhanced electric field effect at the tip of Ni3S2 further promotes electron transfer in the heterojunction structure. FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 Schottky heterojunction exhibits significant OER activity, which provides a method for synthesizing transition metal heterojunction catalysts with low cost and high activity in the future.

Therefore, the widespread adoption of sustainable energy production technologies represents a pivotal advancement. Electrocatalytic water decomposition is a clean and pollution-free hydrogen production technology [6–13]. Electrolysis of water includes hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The OER involves the transfer of 4 electrons [14–18], resulting in slow dynamic process, which requiring significant overpotentials [19–23], limiting the efficiency of electrocatalytic water splitting. Researching OER catalysts with outstanding performance to enhance overall electrocatalytic water decomposition efficiency is indispensable [24–28]. Currently, the most well-known efficient OER catalysts are RuO2 and IrO2. However, their limited reserves, high costs, and price instability constrain their wide application in electrolytic water [29–34]. Transition metal laminated double hydroxides (LDHs) represent a specific type of ionic layered crystal that includes hydroxyl groups, interlayer anions, metal cations, and water molecules. LDHs belong to the class of transition metal compounds [35]. Due to its abundant catalytic activity, large surface-to-volume ratio, tunable chemical composition, layered and controllable lamellar structure, strong electrostatic interactions between layers and interlayer anions, and excellent stability, it has garnered significant attention [36–38]. NiFe LDH is considered as a catalyst for OER [39–41]. However, the lamellae of LDHs can easily stack together, limiting contact with reactants and making the regulation of the crystalline surface and number of layers to become the difficulty. This results in low conductivity, insufficient active edge positions, fluctuating catalytic activity, and difficulty in achieving better catalytic performance [42]. To improve activity of LDHs, scientists have proposed various schemes, including controlling interlayer spacing [43], surface modification [44], and element doping [45]. In this case, when LDHs form heterojunctions with other electrocatalysts [46,47], the exchange capability of anions is enhanced, exposing more active sites, and accelerating charge transfer [48]. Heterojunctions are of three types: p-n heterojunctions, Schottky heterojunctions, and semiconductor-semiconductor heterojunctions. For example, Wen et al. [49] developed a Schottky heterojunction consisting of NiS and NiFe LDH. The coupling of NiFe LDH/NiS can modulation of the adsorption strength of oxygen intermediates to improve OER performance. Gao et al. [50] synthesized a heterogeneous structure of peony-like CuxS@NiMn LDH on NF. The porous structure of CuxS, along with the heterojunction and synergetic effects between the NiMn LDH and the CuxS, electrolyte diffusion to the active site was enhanced during the OER process, accelerating electron transfer. Chai et al. [51] constructs bifunctional Mott-Schottky heterojunction electrocatalyst of Ni(OH)2 and Ni3S4. The Ni(OH)2 inhibiting the decomposition of internal Ni3S4 during the catalytic process, accelerated water decomposition and adsorption of hydrogen intermediates. The Mott-Schottky heterojunction can accelerate electron transfer. The research results show that it is possible to construct heterojunctions in LDHs to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts. In general, when metals contact semiconductor materials, Schottky heterojunctions can be induced, and the different Fermi energy levels (Ef) for two materials cause Ef to arrange and bend band edges under a strong interface effect. An internal electric field is created by the presence of oppositely charged regions at the interface, and the space charge effect can promote electron transfer, optimize the electron structure during the catalytic reaction. Meanwhile, the charge at the tip of the electrode becomes more concentrated, further promoting electron transfer in the heterojunction structure. Inspired by the above analysis, this study utilized a hydrothermal preparation method to in situ generate Ni3S2 nanocones on NF, followed by the preparation of FeCoNi LDH nanospheres on its surface to form a Mott-Schottky heterojunction catalyst with excellent OER active in KOH solutions. The electron enrichment at the top of the nanocone enhances the local electric field, facilitating charge transfer from Ni3S2 to FeCoNi LDH and adjusting surface charge distribution. This study presents a new approach for designing the Mott-Schottky catalysts with excellent electrocatalytic properties for further practical applications. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Chemicals In this experiment, all chemical materials employed were utilized in their as-received state, without any prior processing. All experiments were conducted using deionization water obtained through an Aquapro Nanopure water system. Hexahydrated nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), cobalt dinitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), sodium sulphide hydrate (Na2S·9H2O), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), ruthenium oxide (RuO2) were sourced from Macklin. NF was acquired from Kunshan Jiayisheng Electronic Company. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was sourced from Yongfei Chemical Reagent Company. Ethanol (C2H5OH) was sourced from Tianjin Jindong Tianzheng Fine Chemical Reagent Factory. Nafion (5 wt%) was sourced from Shanghai Hesen Electric Company. Thiourea ((NH2)2CO) was sourced from Shanghai Aladdin Company. 2.2 Synthesis of Ni3S2 NF (1 × 1 cm2) was treated by an ultrasonic method in 2 M HCl, C2H5OH, and deionization water, respectively, dried at 60 °C. A solution of 4.5 mmol thiourea in 30 mL deionized water was prepared by ultrasonic dissolution. The resulting solution was shifted to a PTFE-lined autoclave with 50 ml, and the nickel foam was putted in. The autoclave was then sealed and subjected to a heating cycle of 150 °C for the duration of five hours. Wait for the reaction to finish and cool to room temperature. The Ni3S2 containing NF is then cleaned with deionization water and C2H5OH, and dried at a temperure of 60 °C. The corresponding electrode is labeled as Ni3S2/NF. 2.3 Synthesis of FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 heterostructures were obtained by electrodeposition of FeCoNi LDH nanosheets on the surface of Ni3S2. Electrodeposition is typically carried out by a three-electrode device. The working electrode is a Ni3S2, the carbon rod is used as opposite electrode, and Ag/AgCl is an electrode for reference. The electrolyte was configured by adding 0.0072 mol of FeSO4·7H2O, 0.0072 mol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.0086 mol of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.1 M NaNO3 to 100 mL of deionized water. Then, during the deposition process, the potential was fixed at 2.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 300 s. Subsequently, the catalyst was cleaned with deionization water, ethanol, and then dried. 2.4 Synthesis of RuO2/NF First, 10 mg of RuO2 was put into 475 μL of ethanol and 475 μL of deionization water, add 50 μL of 5 wt.% Nafion solution and sonicate until a uniform ink is formed. Then, 100 μL was slowly added to the NF (1 × 1 cm2) surface and the electrode was dried. 2.5 Materials characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) diagrams of the catalysts were obtained by XRD (Rigaku, D/MAX2500) scanning speed of 8 degrees per minute with a range of 10–80 degrees. At a working voltage of 5 kV, the micromorphology of the catalyst was recorded by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Phenom ProX) and the element distribution of the catalyst was recorded by X-ray energy spectrometry. The surface analysis of the catalyst was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, ESCALAB250Xi) with energy resolution of 0.45 eV. The XPS spectra are calibrated by moving the detected c1s peak to 284.8 eV. 2.6 Electrochemical test Electrochemical measurements are carried out with the standard three-electrode system of the electrochemical work station (CH760E) with an iR-correction of 95 %. The prepared catalysts were employed as a working electrode, and their electrochemical performance were evaluated by a cyclic voltammetry (CV). The electrode for reference was a standard Hg/HgO electrode in a 1 M KOH, while the opposite electrode was a Pt wire. Multiple CV was performed until the CV curve stabilized, and then linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) was recorded at a scan rate of 1 mV s-1 within the range of 0.2 V to 1.2 V relative to the Hg/HgO. The relationship between the potentials for all measurements and the Hg/HgO is transformed by the formula: Evs. RHE = E vs. Hg/ HgO + 0.059 × pH + 0.098 V. By plotting the relationship between overpotential and log (current density) in the linear region of the LSV curve, the Tafel slope can be obtained. The corresponding value was calculated in accordance with the Tafel equation: ŋ = b × log j + a, where ŋ refers to overpotential, b refers to Tafel slope, and j refers to current density. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were carried out over a frequency range of 100 kHz–10–2 Hz. The stability of the catalyst was estimated through chronopotentiometry test. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was characterized using the electrochemical double layer capacitors (Cdl). CV scanning is performed at the scanning rates of 20 mV s-1, 40 mV s-1, 60 mV s-1, 80 mV s-1, and 100 mV s-1 within the scope of 0.1 V to 0.2 V relative to the Hg/HgO. 3 Result and discussion The synthesis diagrams for FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF were illustrated in Fig. 1 a. In Fig. 1b, the NF surface appears almost smooth. Ni3S2 nanocones were fabricated through in situ growth on NF substrates via hydrothermal vulcanization, as depicted in Fig. 1c, where the Ni3S2 nanocones are closely aligned on the NF surface. The vertically grown Ni3S2 in situ enables efficient electrical contact at active sites and superior mass transfer performance. In Fig. 1d, FeCoNi LDH was densely deposited onto Ni3S2 nanocones using electrodeposition. For a clearer view of the FeCoNi LDH morphology, a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image is provided in Fig. S1 of the supplementary information, revealing a nanosheet structure. As illustrated in Fig. 1d, the nanosheets aggregate into microspheres that uniformly cover the Ni3S2 nanocones. This microsphere structure facilitates exposure of active sites and accelerating OER reaction, thereby improved catalytic activity. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) images in Fig. 1e show that Co, Fe, Ni, O, and S elements are evenly distributed on the surface of FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2, and the corresponding elemental composition ratio is shown in Fig. S2 of the supplementary information. Additionally, the XRD pattern in Fig. S3 shows only the diffraction peaks of Ni3S2, with FeCoNi LDH showing no distinct characteristic peaks. This suggests that the material synthesized via electrodeposition exhibits low crystallinity. For optimal deposition time, the impact deposition time on the catalytic activity was investigated. The LSV curves of the FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 prepared under the electrodeposition times of 200 s, 300 s, and 400 s are presented in Fig. S4a. The LSV curve shows that OER performance first improves and then deteriorates with the increase of deposition time. The optimal catalytic activity of FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF for OER is achieved when the electrodeposition time is 300 s. In Fig. S4b, the Tafel slopes of FeCoNi LDH deposited for 200 s, 300 s, and 400 s are 85.32 mV dec‑1, 38.88 mV dec‑1, and 63.78 mV dec‑1, respectively. In contrast, FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF-300 s shows the lowest Tafel slope, indicating better kinetic performance. The value of Cdl can reflect the active area of catalyst in Fig. S4c. The Cdl of FeCoNi LDH deposited for 200 s, 300 s, and 400 s are 14.81 mF cm-2, 18.62 mF cm-2, and 17.94 mF cm-2. It is found that the Cdl of FeCoNi LDH deposited for 300 s is the highest, which indicates that the catalyst has more active sites. SEM images in Fig. S5 reveal the morphologies of FeCoNi LDH obtained by electrodeposition for 200 s, 300 s, and 400 s. When the deposition time is 200 s, FeCoNi LDH unevenly dispersed on the surface of Ni3S2. When the deposition time increases to 300 s, FeCoNi LDH shows uniform microspheres. As the deposition time increases to 400 s, FeCoNi LDH shows serious agglomeration, which masks more active sites and affects the function of Schottky interfaces. So, FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF-300 s has the best OER performance. For comparison, FeCoN LDHs prepared on different substrates are electrodeposited for 300 s. To illustrate the formation of Mott-Schottky heterojunction, the following analysis of synthetic samples was performed. It is widely acknowledged that Ni3S2 is a metal-type material that has been reported [52]. The electrical properties of FeCoNi LDH are analyzed by the Mott-Schottky curve in Fig. S6. The curve exhibits a positive slope, which indicates that FeCoNi LDH is a semiconducting catalyst of the n-type. Meanwhile, the UV visible spectroscopy in Fig. S7 exhibits that FeCoNi LDH has an estimated band gap (Eg) of 1.94 eV. It is confirmed that FeCoNi LDH is a broad-band n-type semiconductor. When FeCoNi LDH and Ni3S2 are in contact, the electrons are transferred from the Ni3S2 to the FeCoNi LDH. Accordingly, the FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 Mott-Schottky heterojunction is constructed. The polarization curves for FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF, FeCoNi LDH/NF, Ni3S2/NF, and NF are exhibited in Fig. 2 a. The peak at the 1.37 V potential on the LSV curve is caused by oxidizing of the metallic elements in FeCoNi LDH to a high valence state [53]. At 100 mA cm-2, for the NF electrode, the OER overpotential is 429 mV, and the Ni3S2/NF electrode obtained after hydrothermal vulcanization has OER overpotential of 344 mV. In addition, the FeCoNi LDH/NF catalyst needs the overpotential of 248 mV to reach 100 mA cm-2. Notably, the FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 heterostructure is much more active, and the corresponding overpotential is 216 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm-2. To further elucidate the OER dynamics of catalysts, the Tafel slope is obtained by the Tafel equation. The Tafel slopes for NF, FeCoNi LDH/NF, Ni3S2/NF, and FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF are 113.42 mV dec‑1, 99.64 mV dec‑1, 61.11 mV dec‑1, 38.88 mV dec‑1, respectively, in Fig. 2c. It can be observed from these results that the lowest Tafel slope for FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF shows that it has good oxygen evolution kinetics. Fig. S8 of the supporting information exhibits the curves of CV with various scanning rates for the catalysts. The double-layer capacitor derived from the CV curve can account for the number of active sites exposed. The Cdl values of 18.62 mF cm-2 for FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF, 11.42 mF cm-2 for Ni3S2/NF, 3.66 mF cm-2 for FeCoNi LDH/NF, and 2.33 mF cm-2 for NF are exhibited in Fig. 2d. FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF shows the largest Cdl value, indicating that it has more active sites. In Fig. 2e, the EIS exhibits that FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF provide the lowest charge transfer resistance in the OER, suggesting that the heterojunction catalyst has low charge transfer resistance and fast reaction dynamics. As shown in Table S1 of the supplementary information, the OER performance of FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 heterojunction is better than that of most reported transition metal-based electrocatalysts. At the same time, the stable operation of the catalyst is very important. After 110 h continuous testing at a steady current density of 100 mA cm-2, FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF showed good stability in Fig. 2f, indicating its excellent durability. As shown in Fig. S9 of the supplementary information, the LSV curve of FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF after stable operation for 110 h shows no obvious degradation compared with the initial LSV curve, further indicating the catalyst with good stability. The OER performance of FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF was furtherly evaluated by assembling the battery. An electrolyzer was configured with FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF as the anode and NF as the cathode to test its water decomposition performance in an electrolyte with 1.0 M KOH in Fig. S10 of the supporting information. NF||NF, Ni3S2/NF||NF, FeCoNi LDH/NF||NF, and FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF||NF batteries require the voltages of 1.75 V, 1.71 V, 1.68 V, and 1.61 V, respectively, at 10 mA cm-2. In these electrolyzers, FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF||NF has the lowest voltage required at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, further indicating that FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF has good activity in the OER. The fabricated catalysts were further analyzed by XPS to understand the electronic interactions of the FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 heterostructure. The wide-scan XPS spectra in Fig. 3 a exhibit the coexistence of Ni, Co, Fe, O, and S elements on the surface of FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF. The Ni, O, and S elements are detected on the Ni3S2/NF surface, and the Fe, Co, Ni, and O elements are detected on the FeCoNi LDH/NF surface. The high-resolution XPS spectra for different elements are exhibited in Fig. 3b-f. The Fe and Ni peaks remain essentially unchanged during the heterojunction formation process in Fig. 3b, which indicates that there no change in the Fe and Ni valence states. The Fe 2p spectra are at 711.5 eV and 724.4 eV, corresponding to peaks of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively, which indicates that the element of Fe is Fe(III) [54]. The high-resolution Ni 2p spectra of different materials differ slightly in Fig. 3c. The peaks of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 for FeCoNi LDH/NF, Ni3S2/NF, and FeCoNi LDH/NF are located at 855.7 and 873.2 eV, which indicates that the Ni element is Ni(II) [55]. The peaks at 781.2 eV and 796.9 eV for the FeCoNi LDH/NF correspond to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively. The peak of Co 2p3/2 in the heterojunction is situated at 781.85 eV, and the corresponding bond energy is 0.66 eV higher than that of FeCoNi LDH in Fig. 3d, indicates that Co valence state in FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 is above Co(II). As shown in Fig. 3e, two peaks were observed in the Ni3S2/NF sample at 162.6 and 163.9 eV, which are corresponding to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of Ni-S bond, respectively. Two peaks for FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 have a significant positive shift compared to Ni3S2 in Fig. 3e. This shows that electrons are transferred from Ni3S2 to FeCoNi LDH. The O 1 s core level spectrum for FeCoNi LDH shows three different peaks in Fig. 3f. The peak at 529.48 eV belongs to M-O, the peak at 531.21 eV belongs to M-OH, and the peak at 532.64 eV belongs to the adsorption of H2O. However, the peak of lattice oxygen in the O 1 s spectrum of FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 also shifts to higher bond energy. In particular, the binding energy of M-O in FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 is 0.1 eV higher than that of FeCoNi LDH. The slight increase in M-O binding energy indicates that the interaction in the FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 heterojunction is mediated by the O atom, which serves as a bridge between Co in FeCoNi LDH and Ni in Ni3S2 at the Ni-O-Co interface. This results in a shorter M-O bond length, which produces a higher binding energy. This redistribution of interfacial charge plays a key role in surface chemisorption properties and catalytic kinetics. Meanwhile, in the FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 heterojunction, Ni3S2 transfers electrons to FeCoNi LDH. Due to the tip effect of the Ni3S2 nanocones, it is more conducive to electron transport, and the OER activity of the FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 catalyst is enhanced by modifying the interfacial electronic structure. Since the contact between the surface of the catalyst and the reactant is important in OER catalytic process, the wettability of catalyst was characterized by a high-speed digital camera system. As depicted in Fig. 4 a, even after 0.75 s on the surface of NF, the water droplets did not infiltrate, indicating its hydrophobic nature. Conversely, for Ni3S2/NF and FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF shown in Fig. 4b and c, water droplets quickly penetrated the surface. To further confirm the hydrophilicity of FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF, the entry time of droplets into the catalyst was observed by gently contacting its surface with the droplet. FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF exhibited a rapid and complete wetting time of 34 ms, as illustrated in Fig. S11 of the supporting information. This observation indicates that FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF is more hydrophilic, which is beneficial for electrolyte diffusion in catalyst. The enhanced hydrophilicity of FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF may be attributed to its nanosheet structure. These findings suggest that electrolytes can be quickly replenished to withstand fast depletion during OER. The accelerated transfer of OH- and the release of O2 contribute to the efficient catalytic performance of FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF. 4 Conclusion In summary, Ni3S2 nanocones were prepared on the NF surface by hydrothermal synthesis, followed by electrodeposition to produce FeCoNi LDH nanosheets. This process led to the creation of a FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 Schottky heterojunction, which significantly improved the catalytic activity for the OER. The FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF composite demonstrated higher OER activity and stability, the overpotential of only 216 mV is required to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm-2 with a Tafel slope of 38.88 mV dec‑1, simultaneous stable operation for 110 h. XPS revealed the Schottky heterojunction formed between FeCoNi LDH and Ni3S2 promoted efficient electron transfer. Additionally, the unique nanocone structure of Ni3S2, with its tip effect, further facilitated electron movement, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity. This innovative approach offers a promising avenue for the preparation of efficient non-precious metal-based heterojunction catalysts for water electrolysis.

        "dc:description": "Constructing heterojunction is a good method to improve electrocatalytic activity because the heterojunctions can modulate the Fermi level and redistribute charges of the catalysts to accelerate electron transfer. In this study, Ni3S2 nanocones were prepared on nickel foam (NF) by hydrothermal synthesis, and FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 Schottky heterojunctions were constructed by electrodeposition of FeCoNi LDH nanosheets onto Ni3S2 nanocones. Electrochemical results demonstrate that FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF is an efficient alkaline OER catalyst, the overpotential is 216 mV at 100 mA cm-2, and it can maintain stable operation for 110 h. The battery voltage of the dual-electrode structure composed of FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2/NF and NF at 1 M KOH is 1.61 V at 10 mA cm-2. The results of XPS show that the FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 Schottky heterojunction optimizes the electronic structure of the interface, accelerating electron transfer. Additionally, the enhanced electric field effect at the tip of Ni3S2 further promotes electron transfer in the heterojunction structure. FeCoNi LDH/Ni3S2 Schottky heterojunction exhibits significant OER activity, which provides a method for synthesizing transition metal heterojunction catalysts with low cost and high activity in the future.",
