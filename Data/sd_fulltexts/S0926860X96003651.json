Characterizations of catalysts were carried out by X-ray diffraction, temperature- programmed desorption of ammonia and infrared spectroscopy. The rutile-type of VSbO4 is found to be highly selective for the formation of acrylonitrile due to its enhancing effect of reoxidation. Correlation of the XRD patterns and NH3-TPD profiles indicates that the ammonia desorption peak appearing at about 90 is caused by the ammonia adsorption on the VSbO4 rutile-type surface. Ammonia inhibits the formation of carbon oxides and acrylonitrile, and therefore the competition between ammonia and oxygen takes place on the same kind of active site. Propane is found to be adsorbed on another site. With regards to the reaction mechanism, it is proposed that the adsorption of propane on the surface occurs first through a formation of propylene-like adsorption intermediate, which appears to react with oxygen to form an oxidized site. The further reaction with ammonia forms a second oxidized site and finally, acrylonitrile is produced from the second oxidized site. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood model fits fairly the experimental data.

Lee~Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 55-74 of propane, therefore, a much more economical process is feasible if the activity of propane ammoxidation can be made comparable to that of propylene [1]. In fact, the ammoxidation of propane to acrylonitrile has been recently announced to be a commercial process [2]. Propane ammoxidations with rutile-type catalysts, such as V-Sb-O systems, have been widely investigated [3-6]. It was found that the VSbO4 rutile-type, a key component in the ammoxidation of propane, is formed from equimolar mixture of vanadium and antimony oxides [7]. In addition, Andersson et al. reported that the vanadium site can improve the propane activation and that the antimony site can help the inclusion of nitrogen in propane ammoxidation [6]. The XPS study revealed that the suprasurface antimony site is formed on VSbO4 phase [4]. Kinetic study of propane ammoxidation on V-Sb-Al-based mixed oxide catalyst has been performed by Catani et al. [5] using the Langmuir-Hinshel- wood approach. The feed source with higher propane to (O2+NH3) ratio, propane recycle, and oxygen (instead of air) is used in this study. The deacti- vation of propane conversion is thought as being due to the competitive adsorption of ammonia and propane on the same sites, the consequence is that ammonia affects both the formation of acrylonitrile and the reduction of active site [3]. Other types of catalysts are also utilized in propane ammoxidation. Among these, Bi-V-Mo-O scheelite catalysts were found to be more effective for acrylonitrile formation under the reaction conditions of high space time, high reaction temperature (>500) and high feed concentration of propane (>40%) [3,8,9]. As for the study of V-P-O system [3,10,11], it was reported that the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst is the active phase for the commercial process of butane conversion to maleic anhydride [12], but its catalytic performance is not adequate to propane ammoxidation. Besides, the propane ammoxidation was also carried out with multicomponent mixed oxides catalysts, such as Ca-Bi-Mo systems [13,14]. The best perfor- mance is obtained with Ca6Bi6MOl2 type oxides whose maximum selectivity to acrylonitrile and conversion of propane are found to be 63% and 15%, respectively. Although V-Sb-O catalyst systems may form different crystalline structures, only the VSbO4 rutile-type and Sb204 were found to have high activity for the propane ammoxidation. Nevertheless, very few studies were focused on the mechanism and kinetics of propane ammoxidation. In this work, crystal phase and surface structure of a series of V/Sb catalysts were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and temperature-programmed deso- rption of ammonia. The catalytic behaviors in propane ammoxidation were investigated to gain insight the relationships existing between active phase and activity of such catalysts. Furthermore, the mechanism and kinetic model of the propane ammoxidation were also studied. H.-B. Chiang, M.-D. Lee~Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 55-74 57 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of catalyst The vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts with various atomic ratios of V to Sb were prepared by the coprecipitation method [6]. The appropriate amounts of ammonia vanadium and antimony oxide were mixed in an aqueous solution of oxalic acid under vigorous stirring at 80 for 12 h. After evaporating water by heating and agitating, the viscous slurry obtained was dried at 120 for 48 h and then calcined at 530 for 8 h in an air stream. 2.2. Characterization of catalyst The X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on M03XHF diffractometer using CuKot radiation with a scanning range (20) from 5to 75 The ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) experiment was performed to understand the effect of ammonia on vanadium-antimony catalyst. Prior to adsorption of ammonia, the catalyst sample was pretreated in a helium stream at 550 for 1 h to remove moisture, and then cooled to room temperature. The preadsorption of ammonia was conducted in a flowing ammonia (30 ml min-1) with 0.5 g of catalyst at room temperature for 30 min, and then the gas stream was switched to helium to remove the physically adsorbed ammonia from the catalyst surface. The ammonia desorption profile was detected by thermal conductivity detector (TCD) at a heating rate of 10 min-1 from 30 to 550. The desorption of ammonia was recorded as a function of temperature in a helium stream with flowing rate of 30 ml min-1. BET specific surface areas of the catalysts were measured by N2 adsorption using a Micrometric ASAP 2000 in a liquid nitrogen at 77 K. The FT-IR spectra were recorded on a BIO-RAD FTS40 spectrometer with a total numbers of 64 scans for each sample at room temperature in an atmosphere of dry air. 2.3. Catalytic test The catalytic tests of propane ammoxidation were carried out in a conventional fixed-bed flow reaction apparatus as described in our previous paper [15]. The reactor was a quartz tube with 50 cm length by 1.60 cm I.D. which was surrounded by a cylindrical copper block to provide efficient heat exchange and uniform temperature profile. The flow rate of feed mixture containing propane, oxygen, ammonia and argon was controlled by mass flow controller. Prior to catalytic reaction, the catalysts were pretreated in situ to reaction temperature for 8 h under an argon stream. The reactants were introduced into the catalyst bed from the top of the reactor. Effluent products were kept at 250 to avoid condensation and 58 H.-B. Chiang, M.-D. Lee~Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 55-74 periodically injected by a six port sampling valve into GC(Shimadzu R1-A) equipped with a Porapak R column. A thermal conductivity detector (for argon, ammonia, and carbon oxides) and a flame ionization detector (for hydrocarbons) were used in series to analyze the composition of products. All the reaction data are reported on the basis of carbon balance [8]. 3. Results 3.1. Characteristics of catalyst Table 1 represents the vanadium ratio and specific surface area for vanadium- antimony catalysts. The vanadium atomic ratio in five different catalysts, V/Sb(5/ 1), V/Sb(2/1), V/Sb(1/1), V/Sb(1/2), and V/Sb(1/5), are 83, 67, 50, 32, and 17%, respectively. As the difference in specific surface areas for different catalysts are not distinct, the catalytic behavior would be only related to the weight of catalyst. Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the fresh catalysts. The fresh vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts with excess vanadia are found to consist of V205 and VSbO4 rntile phase. The XRD pattern of V/Sb(5/I) catalyst contains both V205 and a weak line of VSbO4 phases. Nevertheless, with increasing antimony composition, the V205 phase decreases and a trace of crystalline Sb204 starts to appear at vanadium ratio of 67% (V/Sb(2/1)). The V205 phase appears to exist only in vanadium-rich catalysts and disappears in fresh V/Sb(1/1) and antimony-rich catalysts. With the increase in antimony component, the peak of crystalline Sb204 phase becomes stronger than that of VSbO4 phase (Fig. ld). Apparently, the Sb204 is the principal phase in V/Sb(1/5). The XRD patterns of used catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. The used V/Sb(5/I) catalyst contains strong V204 and weak crystalline VSbO4 phases. The V205 phase in fresh V/Sb(5/1) is significantly reduced to V204 phase but the VSbO4 phase remains unchanged after the used of propane ammoxidation. The used V/Sb(2/1) catalyst includes three distinct phases: VSbO4, V204 weak line of Sb204. In contrast, the used V/Sb(1/1) catalyst includes only VSbO4 and Sb204 phases. No obvious difference in XRD data is observed between fresh and used V/Sb(1/1) catalysts.

These experimental evidences indicate that the VSbO4 and Sb204 phases are not reduced after the use. Fig. 3 depicts the infrared spectra of both fresh and used V/Sb(1/1) catalysts. The result of fresh V/Sb(1/1) catalyst exhibits the bands of V205, VSbO4 and Sb204. The band at 1018 cm-] is due to the symmetric stretching vibrations of vanadyl groups, while weak band at 985 cm- 1 is assigned to pure V205 phase [ 16- 18]. The bands at 743 and 688 cm-1 are attributed to Sb204 [4]. The typical adsorption bands of V0.92Sb0.9204 are found at 1016, 880, 671 and 554 cm- 1 [ 19], whereas the bands appearing on spectrum of fresh V/Sb(1/1) at 1008 and 880 cm-l (broad) are assigned to VSbO4. In addition, the band at 1008 cm-] can be ascribed to the stretching mode of Sb--O-V and the other band at 880 cm-] to the Sb-O-Sb stretching mode [4]. On the spectrum of used V/Sb(1/1) catalyst, V205 bands disappear, instead, new bands at 982 and 670 cm-~ appear, which could be ascribed to V409 [16] and V204 [20], respectively. Furthermore, the weak bands at 1008 cm-1 (VSbO4) and 743 and 675 cm-] (5b204) remain 90 H.-B. Chiang, M.-D.

For fresh V/Sb(1/5) catalyst, the broad bands at 748, 640 and 600 cm-1 for Sb204 are observed. However, the infrared spectra of fresh and used V/Sb(1/5) catalyst are similar, indicating that no reduction occurs on the surface of catalyst. Ammonia is one of the reactants of the propane ammoxidation. NH3-TPD investigation is indicative of a unique behavior of ammonia on the catalyst surface. In order to estimate the amount of ammonia desorbed, each of the maximum desorption peak is separated using peak separation method [21]. The typical ammonia desorption profile and the result of peak separation are shown in Fig. 5. Table 2 depicts the maximum ammonia desorption temperatures and the amount of desorbed ammonia on each peak for V205 and the sample with various V:Sb atomic ratios. The desorption profile of V205 shows four discernible peaks with maximum temperature at 227, 239, 323 and 402. After incorporating with antimony, the maximum desorption temperature decreases. For V/Sb(5/1), the maximum desorption peaks occur at 82, 225, 257, 318 and 398. The desorption peak at 82 is not observed for V205. The NH3-TPD profile of V/Sb(1/1) catalyst H.-B. Chiang, M.-D.

As shown in Table 2, the total amount of ammonia desorption decreases with increasing the antimony component. The V/Sb(1/5) catalyst does not show any 40\" H.-B. Chiang, M.-D.

These indicate that the antimony inhibits ammonia adsorption on the vanadium-antimony oxides catalysts. 3.2. Catalytic test Fig. 6 shows the conversion of propane and selectivities to propylene, acryloni- trile, and carbon oxides as a function of the atomic ratio of vanadium. Other products, such as C2 and acetonitrile, are not given in the figure. The minimum selectivity to propylene occurs on V/Sb(1/1) catalyst, while the propane conversion and selectivities of carbon oxides and acrylonitrile are observed to go through a maximum. The high selectivity toward propylene is obtained only at low propane conversion. Since V/Sb( 1/1) catalyst shows better performance than the others, it is selected for the detail kinetic study. 3.3. Kinetic study Prior to the kinetic studies, the mass transfer limitation must be discussed to inquire whether it will affect the kinetic parameters or not under the experimental conditions used. The test for external diffusion resistance was carried out by using constant space time (w//) with different amounts of catalyst and gas flow rate [22]. The external diffusion resistance is negligible in the range of experimental conditions employed. A test for the effect of pore diffusion resistance was conducted with varying particle sizes (40-80 mesh) of catalyst. No obvious variations in propane conversion are found, indicating that the role of pore diffusion is also negligible in the range of experimental conditions. Reaction H.-B. Chiang, M.-D.

Lee~Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 55-74 was conducted at propane conversion below 10%, so that the reactor is assumed as a differential reactor [5]. 3.3.1. The influence of partial pressure of reactants Fig. 7a shows the selectivities for the formation of carbon oxides, propylene, and acrylonitrile as a function of propane partial pressure at 500. Similar studies were also made by varying the partial pressures of oxygen and ammonia at the same reaction temperature (Fig. 7b and c). Fig. 7a reveals that the selectivity to propylene increases with increasing the partial pressure of propane, whereas the selectivity to acrylonitrile decreases with increasing propane partial pressure. The selectivity of propylene reduces with an increase in oxygen partial pressure, in contrast, the selectivity to carbon oxides increases with increasing partial pressure of oxygen and the selectivity to acrylonitrile is observed to go through a maximum at oxygen partial pressure of 10.13 kPa. The carbon oxides selectivity decreases drastically with an increase in the partial pressure of ammonia. The selectivity of acrylonitrile also reaches a maximum at ammonia partial pressure near 10.13 kPa. The selectivity to propylene is found to increase at higher partial pressure of ammonia. Fig. 8 represents the dependence of productivities of acrylonitrile, propylene, and carbon oxides as a function of propane (a), oxygen (b), and ammonia (c) partial pressure at 500. In brief, different reaction temperatures, such as 470 and 530, are not given in Fig. 8. Variation of the rates of formation of acrylonitrile and propylene with reactant partial pressure reveals the similar aspect. On the contrary, the effect on the formation of carbon oxides is quite different. 3.3.2. Reaction model Fig. 8 demonstrates that the rate of product formation increases with increasing propane partial pressure. The more catalyst surface occupied by more propane, the more products are formed. The result of Fig. 8b shows that the rate of carbon oxide formation increases significantly with an increase in oxygen partial pressure. In contrast, Fig. 8c reveals that the productivity of carbon oxide decreases drastically with increasing partial pressure of ammonia. These results imply that two different sites, propane adsorption site and ammonia or oxygen adsorption site, exist on the catalyst surface. On the basis of experimental evidences, the reaction order of carbon oxides is negative with respect to ammonia partial pressure and positive with respect to oxygen partial pressure -- a competition between ammonia and oxygen for the same site is assumed. The competitive sites between ammonia and oxygen are also observed in toluene ammoxidation to benzonitrile [23] and propane ammoxidation on V-Sb--O/y-A1203 catalyst [5]. The true reaction mechanism cannot be determined by the kinetic study, but the experimental evidence obeys the Langmuir-Hinshelwood [24] type which is a better description than power law. Therefore, the following reaction rate can be derived. H.-B. Chiang, M.-D.

Lee~Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 55-74 For acrylonitrile and propylene, the overall reaction rate can be given by: krKpKoKAPOA r = (1) (1 + kpP)(1 + KoO + KAA)2 For carbon oxides, the overall reaction rate can be derived as: krKpKoPO r = (2) (1 + KpP)(1 +KoO+KAA) where P, O, and A denote the partial pressures of propane, oxygen, and ammonia, respectively, kr is a kinetic rate constant, and K~ Ko, KA are the adsorption equilibrium constants for propane, oxygen, and ammonia, respectively. 3.3.3. Parameter estimation The residual sum of squares for the rate values is defined as: = Z(riexp -- ricalc)2 (3) where riexp and ricalc are the experimental and calculated reaction rates (productivity of products), respectively. The parameters of Eqs. (1) and (2) are evaluated by non-linear regression technique using Marquardt method [22]. The new estimated parameters are then utilized as a new starting point and the process is repeated until a minimum value of d~ is obtained. The rate constants and adsorption equilibrium constants should be represented by Arrhenius equations such as [22], kr = Ar exp(-E/RT) (4) Kp = ~p exp(-Hp / RT) (5) Ko = so exp(-Ho/RT) (6) KA = C~A exp(-HA/RT) (7) where Ar and ot are frequency factor, and E and H the activation energy and adsorption heat, respectively. The estimated parameters for the kinetic model and Arrhenius equation are shown in Table 3. 4. Discussion Fig. 6 shows that the best catalyst for the reaction of propane ammoxidation has a V:Sb atomic ratio of 1:1. This is consistent with the result reported by Centi et al. [3]. On the contrary, Nillson et al. [4] and Andersson et al. [6] indicated that the V:Sb ratios of 1:2 and 1:5 exhibit best performance for propane ammoxidation. In comparison with the results of activity test (Fig. 6) and XRD pattems (Fig. 1), it is H.-B.

The infrared spectra of V/Sb(1/1) catalyst (Fig. 3) indicate that there are some adsorption bands of V205, the band at 1018 cm-~ may be the amorphous V205 which is available for converting ammonia to nitrogen and depositing on the surface of catalyst [3,6]. It is clearly observed from the XRD patterns of used catalysts (Fig. 2), on vanadium-rich catalysts, V205 is reduced to V204 in propane ammoxidation. A similar result is also observed in the ammoxidation of toluene on V205 catalyst [25]. The amorphous V205 appeared on the surface of V/Sb(1/1) catalyst can also be reduced to V204 after the catalytic reaction (Fig. 3). Meanwhile, it is seen from XRD patterns (Fig. 2) and infrared spectrum (Fig. 3b) that VSbO4 and Sb204 phases exist simultaneously in both fresh and used V/Sb(1/1). The fact that VSbO4 and Sb204 would not be reduced after the catalytic reaction has been postulated due to the rapid reoxidation of VSbO4 rutile-type [26]. Centi et al. [27] reviewed the oxidation reaction over antimony base mixed oxides with the rutile-structure, and summarized that the antimony in rutile-type mixed oxides is active in allylic oxidation only in the higher oxidation state (SbS+), which is quickly reduced during oxidation reaction, but reoxidized by gaseous oxygen with great difficulty when it is not in the rutile-type matrix. 70 H.-B. Chiang, M.-D. Lee~Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 55-74 The VSbO4 phase is reported to have the rutile structure with valences V3and Sb5+ [28]. Berry et al. [29,30] indicate the VSbO4 rutile-type has the oxidation state to be Sb5+ and V3+/V5+. Rapid reoxidation favors the VSbO4 rutile-phase to be stable and Sb in the VSbO4 always to maintain its high oxidation state. Therefore, the conclusion can be drawn that the VSbO4 rutile-type is an active phase for propane ammoxidation, and the Sb204 phase acts as a promoting component. The results of NH3-TPD (Table 2) show that a maximum ammonia desorption peak appears at about 82 with the formation of VSbO4 phase in V-Sb-O catalyst. In contrast, there is no ammonia desorption peak to be observed in V! Sb(1/5) catalyst which is mainly composed of 5b204 phase. The results of NH3- TPD also infer that all the ammonia desorption peaks appeared in WSb(1/1) and V/ Sb(1/2) result from the VSbO4 phase. The four desorption peaks on WSb(1/1) can also be observed in NH3-TPD profile of V205 (Table 2) except the desorption peak at 90, indicating that the ammonia adsorption site on VSbO4 is obviously different from that on V205. On the basis of the above discussion, it appears that higher ammonia adsorption on VSbO4 rutile-type surface is favorable for the conversion of propane and selectivity to acrylonitrile. 4.1. Mechanism and kinetics It has been widely investigated that the first step of the propane ammoxidation is the formation of propylene-like intermediate [1,3-5,10,24]. Fig. 6 shows that the selectivity to propylene is high at lower propane conversion, but the yield of propylene decreases significantly with propane conversion. Centi et al. [3,5] reported that the adsorbed ammonias on catalyst surface react themselves to form nitrogen oxides and then convert to N2 during propane ammoxidation. The formation of N2 is only proceeded on the vanadium-based catalyst [31-33]. The catalyst surface may be reduced when ammonia is converted to N2. The consequence is that ammonia plays an essential role in the inhibition of partial oxidation (formation of acrylonitrile) and total oxidation (formation of carbon oxides). Inspection of the experimental results suggests the following possible reaction scheme of propane ammoxidation (Scheme 1). As shown, the intermediate, propylene(ad.), is considered as the product of propane dehydrogenation. The intermediate reacts with oxygen to form oxidized site, Sox, and a further reaction with ammonia results in second oxidized site, Sox(Ni~). However, Sox(NH) will be reduced to S(red.) reduction site when it reacts with ammonia to form nitrogen. The model can explain the effects of partial pressure of reactants. The increase in propane partial pressure leads the intermediate concentration to increase, and at the meantime, oxygen and ammonia become the limiting reactants. Therefore, the selectivity to propylene (Fig. 7) gradually increases and all of the productivity of products (Fig. 8a) increase with increasing propane partial pressure. In addition, H.-B.

Schematic diagram of propane ammoxidation. 71 with decreasing oxygen partial pressure, both selectivities of acrylonitrile and carbon oxides (Fig. 7b) fall in accordance with the concentration of Sox oxidized site, and therefore high selectivity to propylene is obtained. When the oxygen partial pressure increases continuously, more Sox will react with ammonia to form considerable Sox(Ni-i) second oxidized sites. This situation is in favor of the formation of acrylonitrile but the Sox site can also convert to carbon oxides. Since the Sox site cannot completely react with ammonia to form the Sox(NH) site at low ammonia partial pressure, the high concentration of carbon oxides is formed from Sox oxidized site. The increase in Sox(NH) site with increasing ammonia partial pressure favors the selectivity of acrylonitrile (Fig. 7c). The inhibition effect of ammonia on the formation of carbon oxides tends to increase the selectivity to propylene. High partial pressure of ammonia produces more remarked effect upon the reduction of catalyst by Sox(NH) site, both of the concentrations of Sox and SoNI-I) sites decrease as well as the formation of acrylonitrile and carbon oxides. Hence, the proposed scheme can describe completely the effects of partial pressure of reactants on the product distribution in the propane ammoxidation. The experimental data seems to fit the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model. The model is proposed on the assumption that ammonia competes with oxygen for the same site on the catalyst surface. The comparison of experi- mental data and calculated data is demonstrated in Fig. 9. The results show that the experimental data agree with the calculated data in the range of reaction conditions. 5. Conclusions The catalytic test shows that the highest propane conversion and selectivity of acrylonitrile are obtained on the catalyst V/Sb(1/1). According to the results of 16 H.-B. Chiang, M.-D.

Lee~Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 55-74 73 XRD and IR spectra, VSbO4 rutile-type phase is thought to be an active phase under the promotion of Sb204. During the catalytic reaction, the VSbO4 rutile-type reoxidized rapidly, so there are no significant difference to be observed between the fresh and used V/Sb(I/1) catalyst which consists of VSbO4 rutile-type and Sb204 phases. The NH3-TPD shows that the desorption peak appeared at the maximum desorption temperature (90) is ascribed to the adsorption of ammonia on the VSbO4 surface. The kinetic studies indicate that there are two different active sites, propane adsorption site and oxygen or ammonia adsorption site, on the surface of catalyst. The ammonia competes with oxygen for the same site on surface. The effects of partial pressure of reactants on the product distribution can be well explained by reaction scheme proposed. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood approach also fits the experimental data in the experimental conditions. Acknowledgements Financial support of this work by the National Science Council, R.O.C.

Characterizations and catalytic behaviors of vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts in propane ammoxidation Heng-Bo Chiang Min-Dar Lee * Department of Chemical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan 106 * Corresponding author. Fax: +886 2 3623040. The ammoxidation of propane to acrylonitrile was investigated over a series of V/Sb mixed oxide catalysts. Characterizations of catalysts were carried out by X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia and infrared spectroscopy. The rutile-type of VSbO4 is found to be highly selective for the formation of acrylonitrile due to its enhancing effect of reoxidation. Correlation of the XRD patterns and NH3-TPD profiles indicates that the ammonia desorption peak appearing at about 90°C is caused by the ammonia adsorption on the VSbO4 rutile-type surface. Ammonia inhibits the formation of carbon oxides and acrylonitrile, and therefore the competition between ammonia and oxygen takes place on the same kind of active site. Propane is found to be adsorbed on another site. With regards to the reaction mechanism, it is proposed that the adsorption of propane on the surface occurs first through a formation of propylene-like adsorption intermediate, which appears to react with oxygen to form an oxidized site. The further reaction with ammonia forms a second oxidized site and finally, acrylonitrile is produced from the second oxidized site. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood model fits fairly the experimental data.
