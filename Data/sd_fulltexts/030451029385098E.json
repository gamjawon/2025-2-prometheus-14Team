Hansen, G.J. Hoogers and W. Drenth* Debije Institute, Department of Physical Organic Chemistry, Utrecht Uniuersity, Padualaan 8, 3584 CH Utrecht (Netherlands) (Received October 1, 1992; accepted October 26, 1992 ) Abstract Manganese and ruthenium porphyrins were anchored on to polystyrene beads and silica powder and tested as catalysts in the decomposition of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide. With Mn and Ru porphyrins anchored on to polystyrene approximately 30% of the peroxide was decomposed in 2 h, whereas with the porphyrins anchored on to silica, 55 and 66% of the peroxide, respectively, was decomposed. With ruthenium porphyrins anchored on to silica, better results were obtained than with non-anchored ruthenium porphyrins. Experiments with catalysts supported on polystyrene beads showed that in order to obtain a well-defined anchored catalyst, insertion of the metal must be carried out before the catalyst is anchored on to the support. Furthermore, silica powder is preferred to polystyrene beads as supporting material Key words: cyclohexyl hydroperoxide; decomposition; manganese; polystyrene; porphyrins; ruthenium; silica; supported catalysts Introduction Oxidation of cyclohexane by molecular oxygen to give cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone is an important industrial process. This reaction is used to produce approximately 106 tons of cyclohexanol annually [ 1 ] . An intermediate in this reaction is cyclohexyl hydroperoxide. As catalyst for the decomposition of this peroxide, a homogeneous cobalt complex is often used. One problem associated with this catalyst is its subsequent separation from the reaction mixture for reuse. Separation is facilitated by anchoring the catalyst to a solid support. For reviews on anchored homogeneous catalysts see ref. 2. We have prepared several metalloporphyrins anchored on to polystyrene beads and on to silica powder and examined their catalytic activity in the decomposition of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

Catal. 79 (1993) 153-163 Results and discussion Synthesis of porphyrins anchored on to polystyrene In the literature, to anchor porphyrins on to polystyrene, several functional groups have been introduced into polystyrene. Chloromethylated polystyrene has been applied in reactions with porphyrins containing a carboxyl, amino or chlorocarbonyl group [3], and aminopolystyrene in reactions with porphyrins containing a chlorosulfonyl or a chlorocarbonyl group [4 ] . In the present research, porphyrins containing four carboxyl groups were synthesized. These porphyrins were treated with thionyl chloride and, then, by Friedel-Crafts acylation, anchored on to polystyrene (Fig. 1) [3 ] . This route was used to couple three different porphyrins with polystyrene: 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (H2(tCPP)) (to give H2 (1)), Mn (tCPP) Cl to give Mn (1) and Ru (tCPP) (CO) (to give Ru (1)) . After the metal free porphyrin had been anchored, Hz (1) , manganese was inserted into the porphyrin moiety by treating the beads with Mn (OAc) 2 4 H20 in boiling N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) [ 5 ] . In this way catalyst Mn (2) was obtained.

Some properties of the catalysts are listed in Table 1. Synthesis of porphyrins anchored on to silica powder Silica powder was treated with 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane to provide a spacer [6] and, then, {5-(4-carboxyphenyl)-10,15,20-triphenylporphyrinato}manganese or ruthenium was coupled with the spacer via the carbonyl chloride, yielding catalysts Mn (3) and Ru (3) , respectively (Fig. 2) .

Coupling of porphyrins with silica powder. 156 C.B. Hansen et al./J. Mol. Catal. 79 (1993)153-163 Results obtained with catalysts anchored on to polystyrene The catalytic activities obtained with the catalysts, Mn (1), Ru (1) and Mn (2) are summarized in Table 2. Remarkable in this table is the enormous difference between the results obtained with the catalysts Mn (1) and Mn (2 ), which may be related to the different ways in which they have been synthesized. Catalyst Mn (2) was synthesized by first anchoring the porphyrin and then inserting the metal, whereas catalyst Mn (1) was prepared by just the reverse sequence. The much higher activity of catalyst Mn (2) is at least partly caused by adsorption of manganese to the beads as is evident from the following experiments. To test the influence on the catalytic activity of refluxing the catalyst in TABLE 2 Results of the decomposition of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide into cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone catalysed by polystyrene anchored porphyrins' Catalyst Catalyst concentration/ Peroxide Ketone Alcohol mmol dm-3b decomposed/% formed/% formed/% Mn(1)` 0.1 26 3.6 21 Mn (1) 0.3 29 8.7 20 Mn(1) 0.5 32 13 15 Ru(1) 0.1 28 2.3 24 Mn(2)' 0.5 98 76 15 'The reactions were performed for 2 h at 25 C.

This treatment led to darkening of the polystyrene beads and to catalytic activity. Both findings will be due to adsorption of manganese on the beads. This adsorption has to be the reason why these beads, in contrast to untreated polystyrene beads, exhibit catalytic activity. Adsorption of Mn (OAc) 2 on polystyrene will also occur when the beads contain anchored porphyrins (compare entries 1 and 3 ). This adsorption will be a reason why the activity of catalyst Mn (2) is much higher than that of catalyst Mn (1) . For catalysts containing porphyrins with carboxyl groups, in addition to adsorption of manganese on to the beads, formation of manganese carboxylates is possible. Both facts give rise to an increase in catalytic activity. The assumption that the adsorption of manganese on to polystyrene beads leads to an increase in catalytic activity was supported by experiments in which the catalyst was reused. When catalyst Mn (2) was applied for a second time, only 60% of the catalytic activity remained, and after a third application only 25% was left. This decrease is probably due to leaching of the manganese adsorbed on to the polystyrene; UV-Vis spectroscopy has shown the loss of manganese porphyrin by breaking the covalent bond between polystyrene and porphyrin to be less than 3%. Leaching of the manganese from the porphyrin ring is unlikely, since manganese is bonded very strongly in the porphyrin moiety. From the results described above the conclusion can be drawn that anchoring of the free-base porphyrin, followed by insertion of the metal, leads to undefined catalysts. Fundamental research on catalysts prepared in this way, is therefore not advisable. Results obtained with catalysts anchored on to silica powder The metalloporphyrin catalysts anchored on to silica powder, Mn (3) and Ru (3 ), showed relatively high catalytic activity; see Table 4.

Hansen et al./J. Mol. Catal. 79 (1993) 153-163 ruthenium catalyst Ru (3) exhibited even higher activity than the homogeneous Ru(TPP) (CO) (TPP=5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin). Furthermore, the finely dispersed powder showed good mechanical properties. In order to obtain more information about the stability of the catalysts anchored on to silica powder, catalyst Ru (3) was reused. Noteworthy is the fact that the catalytic activity, when reusing the catalyst, appeared to be dependent on the method used to separate the catalyst from the reaction mixture. The loss in catalytic activity varied from 23 to 75% depending on whether the catalyst was separated by filtration, washing with cyclohexane and CH2Cl2 and drying (23% loss) or whether it was recovered by removing all the volatile components from the reaction mixture at the oil pump (75% loss). Conclusions The experiments with polystyrene beads showed that in order to obtain a well-defined anchored catalyst, insertion of the metal always has to be carried out before the catalyst is anchored on to the support. The anchored manganese porphyrins showed lower catalytic activity and lower selectivity for the ketone than their homogeneous counterparts, except for the catalyst that was prepared by anchoring followed by metallation, Mn (2 ); it showed a higher selectivity. Ruthenium porphyrin anchored on polystyrene, Ru (1), had lower selectivity and lower activity than the homogeneous ruthenium catalyst whereas the catalyst anchored on to silica, Ru(3 ), exhibited higher activity as well as selectivity. It can be concluded that silica powder is a good supporting material for the anchoring of homogeneous catalysts. It exhibits several advantages such as a large surface area and good mechanical properties. Furthermore, silica powder can easily be functionalized and an almost homogeneous distribution of the very small particles in the reaction mixture is obtained. The polystyrene beads used in this research were partly pulverized during the reaction. From the experiments with catalyst Ru (3) in which its stability was tested, it can be concluded that it is easily separated from the reaction mixture and that it can be reused several times. The stability of the anchored ruthenium porphyrins appeared to be much larger than the stability of homogeneous ruthenium porphyrins; the latter are almost completely destroyed within half an hour. The increase in stability by anchoring is probably due to prevention of dimerization of the porphyrin; dimerization leads to destruction of the catalyst [ 7 ] . Experimental Instrumentation The 'H NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker WP 200 or Bruker WP 300 instruments, with the deuterated solvent as internal standard. The UV-Vis CA Hansen et al./J. Mol.

The IR spectra were recorded on Perkin Elmer 283 or Perkin Elmer 1800 FTIR spectrophotometers. The FAB mass spectra were obtained using a VG ZAB 2F instrument. Gas chromatography was performed on a Varian 3700 instrument, equipped with a flame ionization detector, using a Chrompack 25% Carbowax 20M on Chromosorb WAW 60-80 mesh (2 m X 2 mm i.d.) column. Peak areas were measured using a Shimadzu C-3RA electronic integrator. Materials Unless otherwise stated, commercial chemicals were used as received from Aldrich, Janssen or Merck except BaC12 - 2 H20 which was obtained from UCB Bruxelles and tetrabutylammonium perchlorate which was obtained from Fluka. Some properties of the supporting materials, polystyrene from Aldrich and Silica 239 from Grace, are listed in Table 5. Cyclohexane was distilled from molecular sieves (4 A) under N2. CH2C12 (kinetic experiments) was dried for 1 week over CaCl2, distilled from CaC12 and stored under N2. HOAc, CHC13, EtOH, MeOH and water were freed from 02 by means of vigorous stirring under reduced pressure (15 mmHg) at room temperature for 1 h, meanwhile repeatedly filling the vessel with N2 and reapplying the reduced pressure. Toluene was dried over KOH for 1 week, and distilled from sodium sand under N2. Silica gel (column chromatography, Merck, art. 9385, 0.040-0.0063 mm, 230-400 mesh ASTM) was kept under N2. Cyclohexyl hydroperoxide dissolved in cyclohexane was donated by DSM. The concentration was determined by iodometric titration. Every day a fresh Fe (SCN) 2 solution was prepared by mixing equal volumes of an FeCl2 solution and an NH4SCN solution (30 g NH4SCN in 100 cm3 water). The FeC12 solution was obtained by adding an acidified BaCl2 solution (0.8 g BaC12, 50 cm3 water and 2.0 cm3 HCl) to an FeS04-7H2O solution (1.0 g FeS04-7H2Oin 50 cm3 water) resulting in a white precipitate. After filtration, the FeCl2 solution could be used for 10 days [8 ] . Decomposition reactions The decomposition reactions were carried out in a Schlenk tube thermostated at 25.0 0.2 C. The tube was filled with 10.5 cm3 of a 0.150 mol dm-3 cyclohexyl hydroperoxide solution in cyclohexane/CH2C12 (20:1). Catalyst 160 C.B. Hansen et al./J. Mol. Catal. 79 (1993)153-163 was added until the metal concentration was 0.1 mmol dm-3. The reaction was stirred magnetically (stirring rod 0.5 X 0.7 cm at 1000 rpm). Two samples were taken, the first one, 10.0 mm', was required for the determination of the cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone concentrations, and the second, 1.0 mm', was necessary for the determination of the cyclohexyl hydroperoxide concentration. Spectroscopic determination of the cyclohexyl hydroperoxide This procedure is a modification of the procedure of Kolthoff [ 8 ] . A Schlenk tube was filled with 10.0 cm' of toluene/MeOH (7 : 3 v/v), followed by 1.0 mm3 sample, and the tube was shaken. 100 mm3 of the Fe (SCN) 2 solution was added, the tube was shaken and placed for exactly 5 min in a water bath at 50.0 0.5 C and subsequently for 10 min in a water bath at room temperature. The adsorption at 510 nm was measured and compared with a blank. The exact concentration was determined from a calibration curve. In the blank no cyclohexyl hydroperoxide was added. The determination was performed under N2. Gas chromatographic analysis of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone To 10.0 cm3 of a triphenylphosphine solution in EtOH (12 g dm-3) 5.0 mm 3 of 1,1'-bicyclohexyl (internal standard) was added. To 500 mm3 of the thus prepared solution was added 10.0 mm' sample. The solution was shaken for a few seconds. Approximately 1 mm3 of this solution was immediately analysed by GLC (temperature programme 115 C, 0 min., 5 C/min., 160 C, 0 min.). The measured cyclohexanol concentration had to be corrected for the cyclohexyl hydroperoxide concentration in the sample. Reaction products were identified by comparison with authentic samples and GC-MS. The determination was carried out under a N2 atmosphere. 5,10,15,20-Tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (H2(tCPP)) This porphyrin was synthesized according to the procedure described by Adler et al. [ 9 ] . Because of the hydrophilic character of this porphyrin the purification method was modified. After filtration over a G3 glass frit, the residue was extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus with MeOH during approximately 10 days. The MeOH fraction was cooled and filtered. Since the porphyrin still appeared to be impure, the residue was extracted once more with MeOH in a Soxhlet apparatus. After removal of the MeOH a dark-purple powder was collected. UV-Vis data are in accord with those reported [ 10 ] .

After refluxing for 18 h, the mixture was cooled to 4 C. After two days it was filtered over a G4 glass frit; the purple residue, H2TPP, was dis- CA Hansen et al./J. Mol. Catal. 79 (1993) 153-163 161 carded. The solvent was removed from the filtrate and the purple-black residue extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus with CH,Cl2. The extract was concentrated and placed on a column (450 g silica, Ocolumn-5 cm) and eluted with CHC13/MeOH (95:5 v/v). After passage of approximately 180 cm3 of eluent, besides H,TPP, some of the desired porphyrin was present in the fractions (TLC, silica, CHC13/MeOH (95:5 v/v), RF (product) =0.32 ). These fractions were again submitted to wet column chromatography (500 g silica, Ocolumn=5 cm, CHC13). After passage of approximately 560 cm3 of eluent the fractions contained no more H2TPP. These fractions were collected, concentrated in CHC13, and again submitted to wet column chromatography (450 g silica, Oc .olumn=5 cm). Elution occurred with 2100 cm3 THF/diethyl ether (1:1 v/ v), followed by 2000 cm' MeOH and 1800 cm' CHC13/MeOH (95:5 v/v). Finally, water/THF (1: 2 v/v) was used as eluent and all the water/THF fractions were collected. The THF was removed by rotary evaporation and some HCl added to prevent dissolution of the porphyrin. The porphyrin was extracted from the water with CHC13. The CHC13 was removed by rotary evaporation and, after drying, 1.5 g (5.7%) of a dark purple powder was collected. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, 8/ppm): 8.89 (s, 8H, /3-pyrrole ), 8.42 (m, 3H, 4-phenyl), 8.28 (m, 8H, 2,6-phenyl), 7.91 (m, 9H, 3,5-phenyl +COZH).

FAB-MS (m/z): 659 (M+ ). Mn(tCPP)Cl The manganese insertion was performed with Mn (OAc) 2 in DMF as described in the literature [5 ] . Because of the hydrophilic character of this porphyrin the purification method was slightly modified. After removal of DMF the remaining powder was dissolved in a solution of NaOH and NaCl in water (1.0 g NaOH and 3.0 g NaCI/100 cm3). After stirring for 15 min concentrated HCl was added until the porphyrin had precipitated. Filtration over a G2 glass frit and drying yielded the desired product.

Subsequently, 1.021 g (1.6 mmol) Ru3 (CO) 12 was added. After refluxing for 2 days the solvent was removed. The black residue was extracted 162 C.B. Hansen et al./J. Mol.

FAB/MS (m/z): 870880 (M+H- C02 ), 800 (M+H- PhC02), 373, 401, 429, 480 (Ru clusters). Ru(mCtPP)CO After heating a solution of 0.36 g (0.55 mmol) H2 (mCtPP) in 80 cm' decahydronaphthalene to 60 C, 0.670 g (1.05 mmol) of Ru3 (CO )12 was added. After 2 h the reaction was complete (TLC, silica, acetone and UV-Vis spectroscopy) and the reaction mixture was cooled for 1 day. After filtration over a G3 glass frit, the product was extracted from the glass frit with acetone. The acetone was removed and the porphyrin was dissolved in toluene. The porphyrin was submitted to column chromatography (150 g silica, Ocol mn - 3 cm) with toluene to remove the ruthenium salt. Thereafter, acetone, 10 cm' of 0.1 mol dm-3 HCl and MeOH were used successively as eluent to collect the porphyrin. The combined acetone, HCl and MeOH fractions were acidified and, after removal of the solvents, dried. Yield: 0.39 g of a purple powder. UV-Vis (CH2Cl2,A/nm (log (E/dm' mol-1 cm-1)) ):413 (5.14), 533 (3.99), 567 (3.55). IR (KBr, v/cm-1: 2061 (s), 2000 (s),1898 (s, CO), 1689 (m, C=O),1600 (m), 1005 (s, RON,). FAB-MS (m/z): 786 (M+), 758 (M-CO+). 5,10,15,20-Tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrins on to polystyrene A procedure slightly modified from those described in the literature and elsewhere [11 ] was used. In 8 cm' of thionyl chloride 0.31 mmol of 5,10,15,20tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin was refluxed for 75 min. After addition of 10 cm' of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, the excess of thionyl chloride was distilled from the reaction mixture. Then, the mixture was cooled and 1.66 g of polystyrene, 0.66 g of AIC13 and 5 cm3 of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane were added. The mixture was refluxed for 2 days. Filtration over a G2 glass frit yielded dark green beads, which were washed with 200 cm3 of CHC13, 250 cm3 of MeOH, 200 cm 3 of aqueous NaOH solution (50 g dm-3 ) and 100 cm31.0 mol dm-3 of HCl. Subsequently, they were dried at 100 C under vacuum, which yielded 2.21 g of green balls. Functionalisation of silica powder This reaction was carried out by the procedure described in ref. 6. Dried silica (24.95 g) was refluxed in 140 cm 3 of MeOH under N2 atmosphere for 1 h. After addition of 5.40 cm 3 (30.9 mmol) of 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane the mixture was refluxed for 2 h, and then stirred for 36 h at room temperature. The silica was filtered off and washed with 120 cm3 of MeOH. After drying at 120 C under vacuum 22.92 g modified silica was obtained. C.B. Hansen et al./J. Mol. Catal. 79 (1993) 153-163 163 5-(4-Carboxylphenyl)-10,15,20-triphenylporphyrins on to silica powder In 16 cm' of thionyl chloride 0.45 mmol of metallated 5-(4-carboxyphenyl)-10,15,20-triphenylporphyrins were refluxed under N2 during 2.5 h. After addition of 15 cm' of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane the thionyl chloride was distilled off. The solution was cooled to room temperature, then 15 cm' of pyridine and 4.40 g of functionalized silica were added. After stirring for 1 night, the reaction mixture was filtered and the silica was successively washed with 0.1 mol dm-3 of HCl, CHC13 and water until the washings were colourless. After drying at 110 C 4.2 g of the silica was obtained. Acknowledgements We are particularly grateful to Mr. U.F. Kragten, dr. O.E. Sielcken and prof. dr. G. van Koten for the useful discussions.

Drenth ∗ Debije Institute, Department of Physical Organic Chemistry, Utrecht University, Padualaan 8, 3584 CH Utrecht Netherlands * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. Manganese and ruthenium porphyrins were anchored on to polystyrene beads and silica powder and tested as catalysts in the decomposition of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide. With Mn and Ru porphyrins anchored on to polystyrene approximately 30% of the peroxide was decomposed in 2 h, whereas with the porphyrins anchored on to silica, 55 and 66% of the peroxide, respectively, was decomposed. With ruthenium porphyrins anchored on to silica, better results were obtained than with non-anchored ruthenium porphyrins. Experiments with catalysts supported on polystyrene beads showed that in order to obtain a well-defined anchored catalyst, insertion of the metal must be carried out before the catalyst is anchored on to the support. Furthermore, silica powder is preferred to polystyrene beads as supporting material Keywords cyclohexyl hydroperoxide decomposition manganese polystyrene porphyrins ruthenium silica supported catalysts References 1 K.U.
