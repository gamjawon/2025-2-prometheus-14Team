MIESSNER, D. GUTSCHICK, H. EWALD and H. MtJLLER Central Institute of Physical Chemistry, Academy of Sciences of the GDR, 1199 Berlin (G.D.R.) (Received September 4,1985; accepted November 25,1985) Summary Rh catalysts prepared using NaX, NaY, Al-fly, TiO; and some modified oxides as supports have been characterized by PT-IR spectroscopy of CO adsorbed on the reduced samples. It has been found that the IR spectros- copic parameters k(CO) and ft(CO CO') obtained from the twin band due to the geminal dicarbonyl species are dependent on the support. The stretching parameter fe(CO) increases in the order NaX < Ala03 < NaY < TiO;, indicating a decreasing back-bonding ability of supported Rh in the same order. This is in agreement with the desorption behaviour of CO on these catalysts. The intensity ratio of the symmetric and asymmet- ric stretching bands of CO indicates a bond angle of the carbonyl groups in Rh^CO)^ higher than 90 on zeolites and lower than 90 on TiOy. The results are discussed in the context of the catalytic behaviour of the catalysts in the CO + Ha reaction. Introduction The interaction of CO with supported Rh catalysts is one of the most studied of chemisorption reactions on metal catalysts. There are several reasons for the great interest in this particular system. One reason is its use in many catalytic reactions, especially in reactions converting synthesis gas in hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds [1]. Moreover, it seems that well-dispersed Rh catalysts exhibit an unusual behaviour concerning the CO chemisorption. Usually, following the chemisorption of CO on supported metal catalysts, two forms of CO bonded to the metal are ob- served by IR spectroscopy [2]: (i) linear-bonded CO absorbing at wavenumbers of 2130 - 2000 cm\"1 andi(ii) bridge-bonded CO with absorption bands at 2000 -1650 cm\"1. The absorption bands of both these species depend on the surface coverage due to dipole-dipole or/and chemical interactions. 0804-8102/86/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 360 On highly dispersed Rh catalysts there is an additional form of chemi- sorbed CO, namely the geminal dicarbonyl structure Rh(CO)2. On the basis of IR spectroscopic results, this was first proposed by Yang and Garland [3] and then confirmed by several other groups [4-47]. Especially on highly dispersed Rh/Al203 where the dicarbonyl structure is dominating, the nature of these surface species was carefully investigated. Yates et al. [9] proposed the formation of Rh(CO)2 on Rh sites on edges of small Rh 'rafts' on the support. The bonding of CO to Rh was supported by Katzer et al. [21] on the basis of XPS experiments. On the other hand, there has recently been increasing evidence that the Rh is in the Rh1 state, as has already been proposed by Yang and Garland [3]. According to TPR experiments [36, 39], Rh on A1203 is completely reduced during the usual pretreatment of the catalysts in hydrogen. The formation of Rh1 sites in the presence of CO and the subsequent formation of the dicarbonyl structure was explained by Primet [5, 6] as the dissocia- tion of CO and the formation of oxidized Rh sites. Recently, it has been shown by Van't Blik et al. [39] that the chemisorption of CO on small Rh clusters results in a disruption of Rh Rh bonds followed by an oxida- tion of the isolated Rh atoms. Detailed experiments of Yates et al. showed that the dicarbonyl species indeed consist of isolated species on the surface, and that the IR absorption bands on AljO^ at ~ 2100 and 2030 cm\"1 are independent of the CO cover- age [43]. Therefore, the ^em-dicarbonyl RhI(CO)2 structure seems to be suited to the study of the influence of support on the CO stretching modes. Most of the works employed alumina as support, but there are also some papers in which other supports were reported used. Thus, Erdohelyi and Solymosi [34] used A1203, Ti02, Si02 and MgO as supports and found that there are no significant differences in the position of the bands due to the dicarbonyl species. Similar results were obtained by Meriaudeau et al. [28]. Tanaka et al. [30] investigated Rh supported on A1203 and Zr02, and found a shift of the dicarbonyl bands to lower wavenumbers on Zr02. A dependence on the support was also noted by Worley et al. [26] on com- paring Ti02, Al203,aluminosilicates and Si02. Katzer et al. [21] reported a shift to higher wavenumbers in the case of Rh/Ti02 compared with Rh/ A403. A similar, but not so significant shift was obtained by Evans and McNulty [45], who prepared Rh/Al203 and Rh/Ti02 by interaction of rhodium carbonyls with the supports. The most obvious differences in the IR bands of adsorbed CO can be seen on comparison of Rh on simple oxides and on zeolites. On Rh exchanged in NaX zeolite, the doublet due to the dicarbonyl species occurs at about 2000 and 2100 cm\"1 [19, 35], whereas on reduced Rh/NaY the main doublet at 2022 and 2101 cm\"1 is accompanied by a second doublet at 2048 and 2116 cm\"1 [5, 6,16, 41, 42]. In the present work, results are reported which were obtained with Rh supported on A1203, Ti02, NaX, NaY and certain modified supports. Our main purpose was the systematic study of the gem-dicarbonyl structure 361 on supported Rh after a comparable pretreatment. From the position and the relative intensity of the twin bands, we draw some conclusions concern- ing the bonding of CO molecules, and finally, we attempt to relate our results with the catalytic activity of these catalysts. Experimental Catalyst preparation Rh/A^Oa was prepared by adsorption from a solution of RhC^- SH^O in water on ^-Al^O^. Rh Mg/SiOa was prepared by impregnation of the modified silica support with RhC^-SHaO in water. Mg/SiOz with 2.2 wt.% Mg was prepared by impregnation of SiO; with a MgCl; solution and sub- sequent drying and calcination at 900 C. Rh/TiO; catalysts were prepared by impregnation of TiO; with a corresponding solution of RliC^-SH^O in water. For Rh Na/TiO^, a solution of Na3RhC4 in water was used to impregnate the TiOa support. Rh/NaY was prepared by ion exchange of NaY with [Rh(NH3)sCl]Cl2, Rh/NaX and Rh/NaX-2 by ion exchange of NaX with [Rh(NH3)sCl](OH)2. In the case of Rh/NaX, the zeolite was treated with HC1 before ion exchange. The Rh content was ~1 wt.% in all catalysts, with the exception of lower-loaded Rh/TiO^ catalysts for which the Rh content is indicated in the text. After loading with Rh, all samples were dried at 120 C in air. As preliminary experiments have shown that calcination yields reproducible results, all catalysts were calcined at 400 C in air before use. Some characteristic properties of the catalysts are shown in Table 1. The H/Rh ratio was obtained by a dynamic impulse method with catharo- metric detection of hydrogen [48].

Pretreatment and CO adsorption were performed in situ in a glass cell connected with a vacuum and gas dosing line. The samples were reduced with hydrogen (99.999%, TEGA) at temperatures between 200 and 400 C. During reduc- tion, water was collected in a liquid nitrogen trap. After reduction, the samples were evacuated at the reduction temperature. The adsorption of CO (99.997%, FERAK.) was performed at room temperature at a pressure of ca. 5 torr. Before spectroscopic measurements, the adsorption cell was briefly evacuated at room temperature. The spectra were recorded with a Fourier Transform spectrometer IRF 180 (ZWG, Academy of Sciences of the G.D.R.) at a resolution of 2 cm\"1. Independent measurements of five reference bands of a standard at conditions of different transparencies (similar to those of the catalyst measurements) and over the duration of the experimental work yielded a standard deviation <0.5 cm\"1 for the accuracy of the wavenumbers. Results In Fig. 1, the typical spectra of some of the samples after the adsorp- tion of CO are shown. The twin bands due to the dicarbonyl structure 2100 1900 Wmenumber km'!) Fig. 1. IR spectra of CO adsorbed on Rh/NaX, Rh/AlaOa, and Rh^TiOi. 363 Rh^CC^ dominate in all cases. These structures are supposedly formed only on small Rh particles [39] and we can, therefore, assume that there are such small particles on all supports despite the different H/Rh ratios (Table 1). The different dispersions calculated from H; uptake are mean integral values, which include the existence of particles of different sizes on the surface. The amount and the distribution of these particles depend on the nature of the support and on the conditions of catalyst preparation [36, 66]. The wavenumbers of the twin bands are collected in Table 2. The spectrum of CO on Rh/NaX is quite similar to those obtained earlier by Scurrell et al. [19, 35] and by us [49] for the same system. For CO ad- sorbed on Rh/Al203, there have been many investigations. The spectrum reported in this work is in excellent agreement with that obtained by Katzer et al. [21] who used a similar preparation and pretreatment. On Rh/Al203, it seems that in addition to the dicarbonyl structure a small amount of bridge-bonded CO is also formed, which shows a broad band around 1800 cm\"1. A band due to linear-bonded CO on Rh/Ala03 may be masked by the strong dicarbonyl bands. The spectrum of CO on Rh/TiO; shows the twin band at 2102 and 2038 cm\"1 due to the dicarbonyl structure, a shoulder at about 2070 cm\"1 formed by a linear adsorbed CO and a broad band at 1900 cm\"1 due to the bridge-bonded CO. There is an additional band at 2000 cm\"1, which was assigned by Erdohelyi and Solymosi [34] to CO adsorbed on the TiO^ support. In Fig. 2, the spectra of CO on different zeolite-supported samples are shown. The spectra of the NaX-supported catalysts prepared by different methods are very similar, indicating that both preparation methods yield similar results for CO adsorption, despite the difference in the dispersion TABLE 2 Wavemimbers, stretching and interaction parameters of the gem-dicarbonyl structure Rh^CC^a on different supports Support Wavenura ibers (cm *) Parameters i (N m-1) (s) (as) fc(CO) fe(CO~CO') NaX 2109 2000 1706 90 NaX-2 2108 1999 1706 90 NaY 2100 2022 1717 66 Al,0s 2093 2021 1710 60 Mg/SiO, 2099 2031 1723 57 TiOa, 1 wt.% Rh 2102 2038 1731 54 TiOa, 0.2 wt.% Rh 2099 2037 1728 52 TiOa, 0.1 wt.% Rh 2097 2035 1725 52 Na/TiO, 2091 2022 1709 57 aAssuming a deviation of 1 cm l for the wavenumbers (see Experimental), a maximum deviation of 2 N m\"\"\"1 results for the IR parameters. 364 NaX NaX2 NaY 2100 1900 Wavenumber (cm~1) Fig. 2. IR spectra of CO adsorbed on zeolite-supported Rh. (Table 1). The treatment with [Rh(NH3)sCl](OH)2 obviously results in both cases in an exchange with the NaX zeolite. Attempts to obtain ex- changed zeolites with a solution of RhC^'SH^O resulted, after reduction and CO absorption, in a spectrum with much smaller intensity of the twin band at 2000 and 2100 cm\"1 with a marked shoulder at 2030 cm\"1. Treat- ment of Ca2\"1\"- and Mg^-exchanged NaX with a solution of RhCla-SHaO yielded a CO spectrum with bands at 2100 and 2030(br) cm~1. According to the results of Anderson and Scurrell [14,19], the bands at 2100 and 2030 cm\"1 were assigned to Rh on the outer surface of the zeolite. These species could also be the origin of the shoulders in the spectra of Rh/NaX and Rh/NaX-2 (Fig. 2). The spectrum of CO on Rh/NaY is rather different from the NaX- supported samples. The spectrum is in very good agreement with those obtained at comparable conditions by Primet et al. [5, 6], Gelin etal. [16], Shannon et al. [41] and Lefebvre and Ben Taarit [42]. In the last two works, the origin of the two doublets of CO adsorbed on Rh/NaY was analysed and the authors proposed that the doublet at 2100 and 2022 cm\"1 is due to a Rh dicarbonyl bonded to two framework oxygen ions, and that the doublet at 2115 and 2040 cm~1 is formed by a similar structure where one framework oxygen is substituted by a water molecule. The excellent agreement of our results on zeolite-supported catalysts with those reported in the literature shows that the uniform structure of zeolites guarantees identical results at comparable conditions. On the other hand, supports such as A1203 and TiO;, which have a broad spectrum of surface structures and properties, yield results which may differ slightly. 365 ai ro, 2100 1900 Wavenumber(cm~^) 2100 1900 Wavenufnber km'1) Fig. 3. IR spectra of CO adsorbed on Rh/TiOi and Rh- -Na/TiO;. Fig. 4. IR spectra of CO adsorbed on TiOa-supported Rh with various Rh content. In Fig. 3, the results of CO adsorbed on Rh/TiOz and Rh-Na/TiO; are compared. The addition of sodium to the catalyst results in a significant shift of the doublet due to the dicarbonyl structure to lower wavenumbers, and at the same time causes a change in the intensity ratio between the two bands. To compare the CO adsorption on Rh/TiO^ with different Rh contents, catalysts with 0.8, 0.5, 0.2 and 0.1 wt.% Rh on TiO; were prepared. Rep- resentative results of some of them are shown in Fig. 4. On the samples with lower Rh contents, there are no distinct bands from linear and bridge- bonded CO. The band at 2000 cm\"1 can hardly be seen on the 0.2 wt.% Rh/TiOa. Therefore, this band may be also due to a linear or bridge-bonded CO form. This assignment is supported by the behaviour of this band in the presence of oxygen. Like the other linear and bridge-bonded forms, it disappears immediately with oxygen. There is a small shift of the bands due to the dicarbonyl structure to lower wavenumbers when going to 0.1 wt.% Rh/TiOz, but the ratio between the peak absorbances of the symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes remains nearly the same. On the basis of the wavenumbers of the twin bands (Table 2), the stretching and interaction parameters fe(CO) and fe(CO CO') were estimated in an approximate force field [50, 51]. The separation of the high frequency 366 components in the IR spectrum of the Rh^CO)! species reduces the problem to solving the secular equation: k(CO)(^c + ^o) - 4^ &(CO-CO')(/ic + Ho) =0, k(CO-CO')(nc + ^o) k(CO)(fic + Mo) - 4A2 where ft is the reciprocal mass of C or 0 and v is the vibrational frequency. A similar treatment was applied by Knozinger et al. [13], Yates and Kolasinski [32], Lefebvre and Ben Taarit [42] and Evans and McNulty [45] to analyse the spectra of Rh^CC^. Discussion It is evident from Figs. 1 and 2 and from Table 2 that the support significantly influences the properties of the gem-dicarbonyl species on the surface of catalysts. Generally we should expect such an influence, according to the now widely accepted idea that the Rh^CO); species are isolated from Rh bulk particles and directly bonded to the support oxygen atoms [32, 39, 42, 43]. It has been found by analysis of the IR spectra of isotope-substituted species [13, 32, 42, 45] that the structure of the gem- dicarbonyl may be similar to that in [RhCl(CO)2]2, i.e. a Cay-symmetry around each Rh(I) cation, as could be expected for the d^Rl^I) cation. Like [RhCl(CO)2]2, the structure may by dimeric with two planes con- nected by the two common support-oxygen atoms as proposed by Whymann [52]. The results of the present work indicate the influence of the support in two directions. First, the stretching parameter fe(CO) varies from 1705 N m~1 on zeolites to 1731 N m~1 in the case of TiOa as support (Table 2). Second, the relative intensities of the symmetric and the asymmetric stretch- ing bands differ qualitatively on going from NaX to TiO; as support (Fig. 1). The stretching parameter fe(CO) can be regarded as a measure of the electron-donating ability of the rhodium atom. The back donation from the metal atom to the carbonyl ligand results in a population of the antibonding CO-2W* MO and therefore, in a weakening of the CO bond. For the related compounds [RhX(CO);i]2, Johnson et al. found a decreasing stretching parameter k(CO) in the order X = Cl > Br > I > SPh > SEt [53]. This clearly indicates the dependence of the CO stretching parameter on the electron- 367 donating properties of the ligand X. It is well known for metal carbonyls that the lower the fe(CO) stretching parameter (the weaker the CO bond), the stronger is the M C bond. From the results in Table 2, it can be con- cluded, therefore, that the carbonyl groups in zeolite-supported catalysts are more strongly bound than on Rh/TiO;. This was confirmed qualitatively by desorption experiments. Evacuation (10~4 torr) at 150 C results in complete disappearance of the Rh^CO); bands on Rh/TiO; in the IR spectrum, whereas on zeolite-supported samples these bands are still stable at 200 C. In order to verify this relation, an additional independent adsorption- desorption experiment was carried out on some of the catalysts. In a closed circulating system, the catalysts were reduced and evacuated as described for IR experiments. CO was then adsorbed at room temperature and, after removing the gas phase, the system was closed and the temperature of the catalyst was raised at a rate of 5 C min~1. The amount of desorbed CO was determined by mass spectrometry. The temperature at which the CO molecules were desorbed completely (T^) is compared with the stretching parameter fe(CO) in Fig. 5. It is evident that the stretching parameter is indeed a measure not only for the CO bond but also for the Rh C bond. For Rh/Al203, it has been found [10,11] that the isotopic exchange of \"CO^) with Rh^CO); is a rapid process. From our results we would expect that this process is also dependent on the support: we would predict a faster exchange on Rh/TiOa and a slower process on zeolite-supported rhodium. The results of IR spectroscopy and of desorption experiments point to a lower ability of the Rh atoms on TiO; compared with other supports to donate electron density to the 2ir* MO of the carbonyl groups. This could be the result of the competition of the vacant Ti-3d orbitals in TiO; for the d-electron density of Rh. An increase in the electron density by promotion with alkali in Rh Na/TiQi results in a lower stretching param- o 300 NaX 0 AI^Oy 0 TiO^ WO 1700 1710 1720 1730 k(COl(Nm-'l Fig. 5.

The differences between the two zeolite-supported samples Rh/NaY and Rh/NaX may be also explained by the different electron-donating ability of the support. From acidity measurements it is known that the Bronsted acidity of X-zeolites is weaker than that of Y-zeolites. This was explained by the higher electron-donating ability of the framework in X-zeolites compared with Y-zeolites [54, 55]. This would result in a higher electron density on the hydrogen atoms and, therefore, in a weaker Bronsted acidity. Concerning the Rh-exchanged zeolites used in this work, the higher electron density on Rh in the case of Rh/NaX results in increased back-bonding to the carbonyl ligands and in a lower stretching parameter k(CO) than on Rh/NaY. In a similar way, Blackmond and Goodwin ex- plained the shift in the CO stretching frequency of CO adsorbed on Ru/ zeolites with different Al/Si ratios [56]. To confirm the idea of the dependence of the stretching parameter fe(CO) in Rh(CO)2 on the electron-donating ability of the zeolite framework, a series of experiments is in progress using faujasite zeolites with different Al/Si ratios. The second IR parameter fe(CO-CO') is regarded as a measure of the interaction between the two carbonyl groups including the interaction of the M C bonds. It is usually found that these interaction parameters in- crease with decreasing stretching parameters [50, 51]. It seems reasonable that a stronger M C bond (a lower CO stretching parameter) enhances the interaction between two adjacent CO groups on the same metal atom. On the other hand, interaction parameters are greatly influenced by the bond angle between the two M C bonds, and direct comparisons, there- fore, must be made with caution. Thus, the interaction parameters in the compounds [RhX^O),], with X = Cl, Br, I, SEt and SPh decrease with decreasing stretching parameter [53]. In Fig. 6, the stretching parameters fe(CO) are correlated with the interaction parameters fe(CO-CO'). The correlation is not very good, ^ 70 8 0^ 8 60 ^>Al2 3 \" ou 0 Ma/SiO, o ^ 00 5o\\ 0.1 o.2 i no, 1700 1710 1720 1730 K(CO)(Nm~') Fig. 6. Stretching parameters, fe(CO), and interaction parameters, fe(CO-CO'), of CO in Rh^CO).; on various supports. 369 although it seems that there is a general trend to higher interaction param- eters with decreasing stretching parameters. The intensity ratios of symmetric and asymmetric stretching bands are the second apparent difference in the spectra presented in this work (Fig. 1). It is evident that this ratio is qualitatively different for Rh/NaX and Rh/TiOz. On Rh/NaX the intensity of the asymmetric stretching band is higher than that of the symmetric one, and on Rh/TiOa the situation is just the opposite. A higher intensity of the symmetric stretching band of Rh^CO); on TiOa was also found by Woriey et al. [26] and by Erdohelyi and Soly- mosi[34]. On the basis of the intensity ratio, it is generally possible to estimate the bond angle a between the two Rh CO bonds [51]: Js. = cot^ffl cotg , -as V\" / where Jg and Jag are the integrated intensities of the symmetric and the asymmetric stretching bands, respectively. For Rh/Al203, Yates et al. [10] have found that the intensities are comparable and the bond angle is, there- fore, about 90 . In a similar manner, Lefebvre and Ben Taarit estimated a value of 112 for the main component of the spectrum of Rh^CO)^ on NaY [42]. The evaluation of the integrated intensities is in our case not very accurate because of band overlapping, band shape etc. For Rh/NaX, a bond angle of about 114 and for Rh/TiOa of 76 was estimated. As mentioned, these are only approximate values. Nevertheless, it seems evident that the bond angle in the dicarbonyl species on zeolites is >90 , whereas on TiO; this bond angle is <90 . The origin of different bond angles on different supports may be of electronic and/or steric nature, and needs further investigation. In this connection, it is interesting to note that the mean oxygen-oxygen distance in TiOy (anatase) is greater than in 7 A1203. Therefore, we could expect a greater angle Og Rh Og and, conse quently, a smaller angle C Rh C (a). Finally, it was very interesting to compare the results described in this work with the catalytic behaviour of the catalysts in the CO + H^ reaction. The catalytic experiments are described in detail elsewhere [57]. The catalytic activity expressed as CO consumption per hour and per gram rhodium is shown in Fig. 7 as a function of the stretching parameter fe(CO). In agreement with other authors [21,27,28,34,38,58], a significantly higher activity of TiOz-supported Rh catalysts as compared with other supports was found. This is usually explained by a specific interaction of the supported metal with the TiO; support and/or by providing additional active sites by the TiO;. As shown in Fig. 7, the activity of TiOa-supported Rh catalysts is accompanied by a higher stretching parameter k(CO) of the Rh dicarbonyl species on the surface of such catalysts. It has been shown, however, that the dicarbonyl species disappear under reaction conditions and the rhodium 370 5 BOO ? 600 0 U o 400 0\"o?,02 0 \"0?'' ;700 1710 1720 1730 l<(CO)(Nm~'l Fig. 7. Stretching parameter, fe(CO), of CO in Rh^CO)^ and activity of Rh in the hydro- genation of CO on various supports; conditions: flow reactor, 3 - 5 ml catalyst, 101 kPa, Hi :CO = 2, T = 523 K, space velocity: 4000 h-1. surface is covered only by linear and bridge-bonded CO molecules [27, 38]. As mentioned above, a higher stretching parameter fe(CO) is accompanied by a weaker Rh C bond and a lower desorption temperature. It is inter- esting to note that Rh Mg/SiO; does not follow both correlations shown in Figs. 5 and 7. In both cases, the stretching parameter A-(CO) appears at values higher than expected from the Figures. But also in this case, a cor- relation between a high desorption temperature of molecular CO (ca. 340 C) and a low catalytic activity (ca. 50 mmol CO (g Rh)~1 h~1) is found. The reason for the deviation from the general trend of fe(CO) for CO on Rh Mg/SiO; is not yet clear, and needs further investigation. The results suggest that the CO + H; reaction on Rh/TiO; is enhanced because the dicarbonyl species, which at high coverage may block the active sites for hydrogenation and act as a kind of poison, are easier to remove from the surface. On the other hand, the participation of the dicarbonyl species in the reaction could be possible, but with a concentration on the surface which is too low to be detected by IR spectroscopy. In that case, we would expect from the high stretching parameter fe(CO) on Rh/TlOi a high tendency toward nucleophilic attack at the carbon atom [59,60], which could account for the higher selectivity of CO hydrogenation on Rh/TiO; to oxygen-containing compounds. The CO insertion reaction, which is proposed to be an important step for the formation of oxygenates [1, 23, 61 - 63] may be also regarded as a nucleophilic addition of alkyi groups to the carbon atom of the carbonyl group [64]. On the other hand, a nucleophilic attack on adsorbed CO by hydride or other nucleophiles was proposed by Hackenbruch et al. as the initiating step for oxygenate formation [65]. In our catalytic experiments, we could not find a clear correlation between the IR parameters and the selectivity towards oxygen-containing compounds. But generally, on TiOy-supported catalysts, the selectivity towards oxygenates was higher than 10% (1% Rh: 18, 0.2% Rh: 11, 0.1% 371 Rh: 15 mol.%), whereas on the other catalysts this selectivity was lower than 10% [57]. In their work on the influence of promoters on Rh/SiO; catalysts, van den Berg et al. [67] also discussed a connection between a lower strength of the Rh CO bond and a higher activity on promoted catalysts, and the possibility of formation of oxygenates by a nucleophilic attack at CO coordinated on Rh'4\". Conclusions The ^em-dicarbonyl species on supported Rh catalysts have been shown to be a sensitive measure of the metal-support interaction in that: The stretching parameter fe(CO) obtained from the twin band due to Rh^CO), increases in the order NaX < A^Oa < NaY < TiO;, indicating a decreasing back-bonding ability of supported rhodium in the same order. The increase of the stretching parameter is accompanied by a weaker Rh C bond and, therefore, by a desorption of CO from the dicarbonyl species at lower temperatures. The interaction parameter fe(CO-CO') also varies from support to support, with a general trend to higher interaction parameters with decreas- ing stretching parameters. The ratio of the intensities of the symmetric and asymmetric CO stretching bands of the Rh dicarbonyl differs markedly depending on the support, indicating an influence of the support on the structure of the dicarbonyl species. On zeolites, the bond angle between the two carbonyl groups seems to be higher than 90 , and on TiO.; lower than 90 .

Miessner D. Gutschick H. Ewald H. Müller Central Institute of Physical Chemistry, Academy of Sciences of the GDR, 1199 BerlinG.D.R. Rh catalysts prepared using NaX, NaY, Al2O3, TiO2, and some modified oxides as supports have been characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy of CO adsorbed on the reduced samples. It has been found that the IR spectroscopie parameters k(CO) and kfe(CO—CO') obtained from the twin band due to the geminal dicarbonyl species are dependent on the support. The stretching parameter k(CO) increases in the order NaX < Al2O3 < NaY < TiO2, indicating a decreasing back-bonding ability of supported Rh in the same order. This is in agreement with the desorption behaviour of CO on these catalysts. The intensity ratio of the symmetric and asymmetric stretching bands of CO indicates a bond angle of the carbonyl groups in RhI(CO)2 higher than 90° on zeolites and lower than 90° on TiO2. The results are discussed in the context of the catalytic behaviour of the catalysts in the CO + H2 reaction. References 1 M. Ichikawa Chemtech 1982 674 2 N. Sheppard T.T. Nguyen Adv.

        "dc:description": "Rh catalysts prepared using NaX, NaY, Al2O3, TiO2, and some modified oxides as supports have been characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy of CO adsorbed on the reduced samples. It has been found that the IR spectroscopie parameters k(CO) and kfe(CO—CO') obtained from the twin band due to the geminal dicarbonyl species are dependent on the support. The stretching parameter k(CO) increases in the order NaX < Al2O3 < NaY < TiO2, indicating a decreasing back-bonding ability of supported Rh in the same order. This is in agreement with the desorption behaviour of CO on these catalysts. The intensity ratio of the symmetric and asymmetric stretching bands of CO indicates a bond angle of the carbonyl groups in RhI(CO)2 higher than 90° on zeolites and lower than 90° on TiO2. The results are discussed in the context of the catalytic behaviour of the catalysts in the CO + H2 reaction.",
