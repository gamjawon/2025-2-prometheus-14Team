James The Department of Chemistry, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C. V6T 1Zl (Canada) (Received August 12, 1991; accepted November 27, 1991) Abstract Mononuclear Pd(II), and dinuclear Pd(0) and Pd(I) complexes containing bis(diphenylphosphino)methane catalyze the addition of trichlorosilane to the olefinic bond of hexene-1, styrene and vinyltrichlorosilane. Activity relationships for limited data at 80 and 120 C suggest that in each case mononuclear Pd(0) species might act as a catalyst precursor. Introduction It is now well documented that monomeric Pd(0) and Pd(H) complexes containing triphenylphosphine act as homogeneous catalysts for the hydrosilylation of olefins [ 1-4 ], although a review [5 ] had stated that palladium catalysts were practically ineffective for such catalysis. The palladium systems tend to form a-adducts in high selectivity with some substrates, which appear generally with platinum and rhodium catalysts to give more, and sometimes exclusively, /3-adduct formation [3] (cf. Table 1). For example, with palladium systems the addition of trichlorosilane to styrene, acrylonitrile or vinylchlorosilane, gives respectively PhCH(CH3)SiC13 [11, CH3CH(CN)SiC13 [11 and 1,1-bis(trichlorosilyl)ethane, CH3CH(SiC13)2 [2-4]. Studies from one of our laboratories on the vinylchlorosilane hydrosilylation supported standard mechanisms [5] operating via [Pd (PPh3)2] intermediates, although kinetic data in certain systems implied the presence of active dinuclear species [3, 4]. In the hope of obtaining a better understanding of these catalytic systems, some Pd complexes containing bis(diphenylphosphino)methane, dpm, have been tested and found active for addition of trichlorosilane to olefins, as reported here. It should be noted that despite the considerable literature on the reactions of Pd2X2(p,-dpm)2 (X=anion) with small molecules, especially to give A- *On leave at the University of British Columbia, 1985-1987. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 0 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia.

Equally effective is an in. situ PdCl2+PPh3 (1:2) catalyst [3]. frame derivatives [6-8], remarkably little catalysis via such systems has been reported: Pd2X2(p,-dpm)2 (X=halide) complexes catalyze (a) the cyclotrimerization of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate to hexamethyl mellitate (while Pd2(dpm)3 is a much poorer catalyst for this process) [9], and (b) the conversion of H2S jdpm mixtures to H2 and the monosulfide of dpm via the Pd2X2(p,-S)(A-dpm)2 intermediate [10]. The complexes Pd2(dpm)3 and PdC12(dpm) effect catalytic hydrogenation and deuteration, sometimes coupled with isomerization, of mono- and dienes [ 11 ]. Results and discussion - The data summarized in Table 1 show that Pd complexes containing dpm are effective catalysts at 120 C for the addition of trichlorosilane to hexene-1, styrene and vinyltrichlorosilane. Thus, we have established a further catalytic process that is effected by the Pd2X2(A-dpm)2-type complexes, possibly the first catalytic hydrosilylation using dinuclear complexes containing ditertiaryphosphine ligands. However, the Pd2C12(/,-dpm)2 activity is identical to that of PdC12(dpm), and is not too different from that of the related triphenylphosphine complexes! All the catalysts exclusively give high yields of the a-adduct for addition of SiHC13 to CH2=CHSiC13, mainly the a-adduct with some 3-adduct for addition to PhCH=CH2, and lower conversions to only the ss-adduct for addition to hexene-1. We have been unable to isolate characterizable complexes from reactions of Pd2C12(p,-dpm)2 With SiHC13 or CH2=CHSiCl3 under conditions varying 169 from room temperature in CH2C12 to those used in the catalysis; no evidence was found for formation of Pd-H species or A-frame insertion type products. A pale-brown solid 1 was reproducibly isolated from a reaction of Pd2C12(p,dpm)2 (or PdC12(dpm)) with neat SiHC13 at 120 C under Ar (6 h reaction in glass ampoule, [silane]:[Pd]=50). The air-stable 1 was soluble in CH2Cl2 and NMR data (CD2CI2, 20 C) revealed a CH2 triplet at &(H) 4.19 (J(PH) 10.2 Hz), associated with a singlet in the 31P {1H} NMR at &-40, data typical of a PduX2(dpm) moiety with chelated dpm and monoanionic X ligands [12]; a 1H NMR singlet at & 4.60, together with an IR band (KBr) at 2258 em-1, are assigned to the presence of an Si-H bond [4]. The solid, however, also shows a broad IR band at 1050-1200 cm-1, indicative of the presence of a siloxane Si-O-Si functionality [4]; whether siloxane formation (presumably via condensation of silanol units formed by hydrolysis of Si-Cl) occurs during the work-up procedure or during reaction conditions is unclear, although the latter is indicated (see below). A satisfactory formulation to fit the elemental analysis (C, 48.25; H, 3.60; Cl, 10.64%) cannot be presented at this stage, although the C/H and C/Cl ratios are consistent with the presence of one dpm molecule and two Cl atoms per Pd atom. Similar problems in characterizing corresponding derivatives from PdC12(PPh3)2 and Pd(PPh3)4 were attributed to the intrinsic high reactivity of Pd/H/SiCl units [4], possibly involving three-centred bond formulations [13]. Isolated or in situ formed 1 is as active at 120 C as Pd2C12(u-dpm)2 and PdC12(dpm) for the catalyzed addition of SiHC13 to CH2=CHSiC13, as shown in Table 2 which also lists data for other Pd-dpm systems, including the A-frame bridged sulfide complex. It seems clear from the data. of Tables 1 and 2, that at 120 C all the systems exhibit remarkably similar activity, with a single dpm ligand behaving no differently from two traps-PPh3 ligands. The limited data are consistent with initial formation of an intermediate, unstable Pd(H)(SiCl3)L2 species (L2=dpm or 2 PPh3). This can be effected via: (i) oxidative addition of SiHC13 to Pd , (ii) redistribution reactions at Pdl via a series of oxidative addition/reductive elimination steps [14], and (iii) the disproportionation reaction (1), presumably promoted by interaction of SiHC13 with the product PO and Pd species (see (i) and (ii)). The `constant' activity implies that all the added palladium of each system is at least available as some common intermediate (not necessarily the active species) within the catalytic cycle(s). More detailed rate and kinetic dependence data are needed to support this speculation regarding the mechanism. Pd2C12(p,-dpm)2 _- PdC12(dpm)+'Pd(dpm)' (1) Of interest, the cyclotrimerization of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate catalyzed by the dinuclear Pd2' species is considered unlikely to proceed via reaction (1), because the Pdn and Pd (as Pd2(dpm)3) species were of lower activity [9]. Of importance, the data at 80 C (Table 2) show moderate hydrosilylation activity for the Pd2I complexes, and zero activity for the Pd and PdE species, perhaps implying catalysis via the dinuclear species. Pretreatment of the Pd and PdB complexes with SiHC13 at 120 C generates, 170 TABLE 2 Yields of CH3CH(SiC13)z from catalyzed addition of SiHC13 to CH2=CHSiCl3' Catalyst Yield (9b) 80 C 120 C Pd2(dpm)3 0 79 Pd2(dpm)3 23 83 Pd2clz(dpm)Z 40 88 PdZCIz(dpm)zb, ` 32-46 90-92 Pd2Clz(Ec-S)(dpm)z 23 87 PdClz(dpm) 0 89 PdC12(dpm) 0 79 PdC12+dpm (1:1) 0 89 KZPdCl4+dpm (1:1) traces 89 1 0 92 'Except for noted temperatures, conditions are described in footnote a of Table 1. bComplex treated with 50 molar excess of SiHC13 at 120 C for 6 h under Ar prior to catalysis reaction. `Complex treated with 10 molar excess of SiHC13 at 20 C for 48 h under Ar prior to catalysis reaction. however, some activity with the former system but not the latter (Table 2). One rationalization is that process (i) above occurs more readily than (ii), which is certainly likely, and then the activity of Pd2C12(p,-dpm)2 at 80 C could still occur via the Pd' product of the disproportionation reaction (1). Further studies are on-going in efforts to establish the nature of catalysis generally via, the dinuclear Pd2' complexes. Experimental The silanes, olefins and solvents employed were commercial products and were distilled prior to use. The Pd2C12(p,-dpm)2 [15], Pd2CI2(A-S)(p,dpm)2 [101, Pd2(dpm)3 [11] and PdC12(dpm) [16] complexes, as well as Pd(PPh3)4 [171 and traps-PdCl2CPPh3)2 [18] were prepared according to known procedures. The general procedures for carrying out the hydrosilylation reactions (sealed glass ampoules containing appropriate reagents and catalysts), identifying and quantifying silicon-containing products (GLC and NMR), and investigating the nature of Pd-containing species (elemental analyses, NMR and IR), have been described previously [2-4]. Attempts to synthesize Pd complexes using trichlorosilane or vinyltrichlorosilane as reagents were carried out using standard Schlenk techniques.
