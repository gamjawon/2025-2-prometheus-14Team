Venezian 21, 20133 Milano, Italy Abstract Specific studies carried in Milan laboratory in the application of metal carbonyl clusters to preparation of supported catalysts are reviewed. Examples are reported of catalysis by heterogeneous organometallic surface species, such as 1-butene isomerisation catalysed by silica-anchored osmium carbonyl species, or of catalysis by very small metal particles produced under catalytic conditions, such as ethylene hydroformylation using silica supported [ Rh~2(CO)30] 2- as precursor. Highly active bimetallic Felr/MgO catalysts for methanol synthesis, have been prepared by controlled reductive decomposition of physisorbed [EtaN]2 [ Fe2Ir4(CO)16] and [Et4N] 2[Fe2Ir2(CO)~2] clusters. In these examples, evidence of the nature of the catalytic entities is reached by in situ DRIFTS characterisation under catalytic conditions or using EXAFS measurements. Metal particles deposited inside the zeolitic cavities have been obtained by mild reduction conditions of entrapped organometallic compounds introduced by chemical vapour deposition (CVD). In this way, non-acidic Pt/KL, Pd/NaY catalysts for hydrocarbon reforming have been prepared. Bimetallic Pt/Re and Rh/Mn particles, entrapped inside a NaY zeolite, have been easily obtained by CVD of M~ (CO) .~ carbonyls (M = Re, Mn) on pre-reduced metal particles.

Introduction In the last 15 years the original idea of studying supported molecular clusters as 'heterogenized homogeneous catalytic systems' [ 1 ] has evolved into the concept of supported clusters as precur- sors of metallic catalysts [2].

This new preparative approach has been extended, although less extensively, to the surface of carbon [4] or to the cavities of zeolites [5]. Highly dispersed metal crystallites, as well as surface bound molec- ular species of specific nuclearity, can be obtained by reaction of metal carbonyl clusters with differ- ent surfaces or inside the cages and cavities of zeolites [6]. With zeolites, the problem of the 14 R. Ugo et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 13-22 penetration inside the cavities of rather large sol- vated molecular species such as metal carbonyl clusters can be avoided by chemical vapour dep- osition (CVD) of volatile organometallic species, which can be a metal carbonyl or a traditional organometallic compound. The process of prepa- ration of a heterogeneous metal catalyst by this technique [7] requires two steps: (a) volatilisa- tion and deposition inside the cavities of the zeo- lite of a metal carbonyl or of an organometallic compound, which must fulfil the requirements of small size, well defined shape and a certain ther- mal stability; (b) thermal decomposition of the organometallic species entrapped inside the zeo- lite by controlled heating in hydrogen atmosphere. In this way metal particles are produced by mild removal of ligands such as CO or hydrocarbon moieties or other volatile ligands. This process is quite simple when compared to the traditional cal- cination/reduction cycles for the decomposition of supported metal salts or of metal ions exchanged inside a zeolite. The catalysts so obtained are characterised by the total absence inside the cavities of residues of halides or other anions and of protonic acidity. In addition, it is possible to obtain unusual alloys or cherry crystallites by CVD of an organometallic species on the top of particles of another metal [8]. This article will summarize and describe some investigations carded out in our laboratories on the properties of heterogeneous mono and bime- tallic catalysts obtained either by decomposition of metal carbonyl clusters supported on inorganic oxides or of volatile organometallic compounds deposited inside zeolites. 2. Catalytic reactions with heterogeneous metal catalysts obtained from supported metal carbonyl clusters We first studied the catalytic behaviour of the silica-anchored hydrido cluster Os3 (CO) lO (/z- H) (/x-OSi~) which, under inert atmosphere or under vacuum, is stable up to about 438 K [9]. This surface species interacts reversibly with ole- fins which can be hydrogenated [ 10] or isomeri- sed [ 11,12] under very mild conditions. This interaction has been first studied by trans- mission IR spectroscopy on pressed disc. How- ever, diffuse reflectance FT-IR spectroscopy (DRIFTS) allows observation directly on the cat- alyst in granular form, working under real cata- lytic conditions (gas composition, temperature, gas pressure). In this way, many of the problems associated with studies in situ with the pressed disc approach can be avoided [ 13]. We have carried out in situ DRIFTS studies on the interaction at 343 K of 1-butene with the sur- face anchored osmium cluster, using a porous sil- ica as support. A slow formation of an adduct with 1-butene occurs after 30 min of contact, charac- terised by the replacement of the weak band at 2112 cm-1 with a new one at 2104 cm-1. In addition, a modification of the intensity ratio of the bands at 2077 and 2065 cm-l takes place (Fig. l-a). Both the original anchored cluster and _Q 2200 1900 2100 2000 Wavenumbers e- l C] Fig. 1.

After 3 h at 343 K the concen- tration of the olefin adduct is the highest (Fig. l- b). Spectral changes are completely reversed at 343 K by purging in nitrogen (Fig. l-c), with quantitative regeneration of the original anchored cluster, suggesting that the adduct does not involve any CO replacement. C4HIo Os3(CO) lO( I-L-H) (~-OSi-~) ~ Os3(CO)lo N2 (b-H) (OSi~)(C4H1o) A subsequent treatment in l-butene at 343 K quantitatively regenerates the olefin adduct (Fig. 1 -d, 1-e). Our spectroscopic results strongly support the mechanism of the reversible opening of an Os-O-Os bond, proposed by Basset et al. [10]. The isomerisation of 1-butene was also inves- tigated working at higher reaction temperature, viz. 388 K. At the beginning of the catalytic reac- tion, the anchored cluster being still intact, a rather low initial conversion is observed. After a long induction period ( 14 h) a final steady state con- version value of about 36% was reached, with parallel change of the cis/trans ratio from 0.9 to 0.7. Both FT-IR and XPS studies identified the oxidised surface species [Os(CO)x(OSi@2]~ (x= 2,3) as the real catalytic entity under steady state conditions and that the oxidative fragmen- tation process of the anchored cluster was favou- red by the presence of the olefin [ 12]. In situ DRIFTS studies in flow of N2 at 388 K indicate that this surface fragmentation is com- plete after only 8 h (Fig. 2). On the contrary pre- vious studies in transmission mode on pressed disc indicated that after 58 h bands characteristic of the anchored cluster were still present in the infrared spectrum [ 12 ]. DRIFTS spectra reported in Fig. 2 clearly establish that the surface oxidative frag- mentation process occurs without involvement of intermediates as evidenced by the presence of few isosbestic points. .2 C I [D ._M q) h~ 20,0 17.5 15.0 12.5 10.0 7.5 0.0 , t , 2200 2100 2000 1900 WGvenumbers Fig. 2, Sequential DRIFT spectra in the v(CO) region of Os3(CO)lo(p,-H)(/z-OSi.~) in flow of N2 at 383 K: (a) after 30 min; (b) after 1 h; (c) after 2 h; (d) after 3 h; (e) after 5 h\" (f) after 8 h. By this investigation it is confirmed that, in the presence of 1-butene, cluster degradation pro- ceeds faster, with the involvement of olefin inter- mediates as shown by the absence of isosbestic points (Fig. 3). DRIFTS spectra recorded for over 100 h at 388 K under catalytic atmosphere confirm the good stability of the oxidised species. These molecular surface metal catalysts can be poisoned by CO and activated by hydrogen. On the contrary, silica- supported metallic catalyst, prepared by reducing the osmium surface oxidised species in H2 at 573 K, are characterised by a very different activity and selectivity, which are not influenced by addi- tion either of CO or H2 [ 12]. Therefore we have strong spectroscopic and catalytic evidence of a surface catalysis at molec- ular level, involving carbonyl osmium species grafted to the silica surface, as the anchored cluster at lower temperature or as oxidised species. The observed inhibition effect of CO on the catalytic activity on both kind of catalysts is not simply due to preferential saturation of the free 16 R.

Significant struc- tural modifications of the osmium surface molec- ular species are already observed at 388 K: in situ IR studies gave evidence of a partial reconstruc- tion of the original cluster moiety via reductive carbonylation of the oxidised species. At higher reaction temperatures the formation of volatile Os3(CO) 12 was observed [ 14]. This is likely to constitute a severe limitation in using this kind of molecular heterogeneous catalysts in reactions involving CO as reagent. We confirmed such a statement by studying vapour phase ethylene hydroformylation at 453 K, using as catalyst either the anchored osmium cluster or the oxidised surface osmium carbonyl fragments. Formation of oxygenated products is not observed but only a very moderate hydrogen- ation to ethane. Complete deactivation occurs after only 2 h, due to the quantitative transfor- mation of the surface-grafted osmium carbonyls into the volatile Os3(CO)12 and H4Os4(CO)12 clusters. The metal leaching from the support into the gas phase, as volatile carbonyl species, is pre- vented on basic surfaces, such as MgO [ 15 ]. For instance, anionic Os carbonyl clusters generated in situ at 548 K during catalytic CO hydrogenation are stabilised by strong ionic interactions with the support. With this point in mind we studied the [Rh~2(CO)3o]2- cluster anion supported on sil- ica as a potential molecular heterogeneous catalyst for vapour phase ethylene hydroformylation [ 16]. In addition to the expected low volatility under catalytic conditions of this anionic species, the presence of metal cations associated with the Rh12 framework was likely to offer a further advantage at molecular level. In fact it was known the pro- motion effect for CO insertion by addition ofZn2 [17] and Na[18] to conventional oxide-sup- ported metallic rhodium catalysts. A selectivity of about 32% to propanal was observed with silica supported Naz[ Rh t2 (CO) 30 ] working at 453 K, without any induction period [ 19]. The parallel reaction was ethylene hydro- genation to ethane. The absence of any induction period, together with the constant activity to hydrofonnylation for over 100 h suggested that the cluster framework could be stable under reac- tion conditions as the catalytically active species. This stability under reaction conditions is likely to be explained with the presence of CO + HE atmosphere, preventing any oxidative fragmen- tation processes at 453 K. This first hypothesis has been supported by in situ infrared studies, carried out on a pressed disc of the freshly prepared cat- alyst, immediately exposed to hydroformylation mixture under catalytic conditions [ 16]. There is no evidence of sintering to large rho- dium crystallites during the catalytic process, because XRD studies on used catalysts did not detect the presence of metallic particles larger than 20 ,~ [19]. The unpromoted catalyst, prepared from [Rh4(CO)12], was still active but the selec- tivity to propanal was 25% only. The very low activity of supported metallic rhodium, conven- tionally prepared from RhC13, could be explained in terms of metal dispersion, because XRD studies R. Ugo et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 13-22 17 on used catalyst indicate the presence of particles of at least 40 ,~ [ 19]. The selectivity to propanal can be increased, as expected, to 50% working at lower temperature, 393 K instead of 453 K. At this temperature, how- ever, a long induction period (20 h) was observed to reach a steady state conversion suggesting a slow transformation of the starting anionic cluster into more active species. In agreement with this hypothesis, when the fresh catalyst was pre- treated in Ar flow at 393 K for 3 h before the admission of the hydroformylation mixture, a sig- nificant increase of the catalytic activity, was observed without any induction period [20]. In agreement with the well-known chemistry of supported rhodium cluster carbonyls [21], DRIFT investigations indicate that during the pre- treatment at 393 K a disruption of the Rh12 cluster framework into the isolated RhI gem-dicarbonyl species takes place. A DRIFT investigation under real catalytic conditions showed only a broad band around 2035 cm- ~ characteristic for CO linearly bonded on metallic particles suggesting that a fast surface restructuring by reductive carbonylation of the isolated Rh~(CO)2 sites has thus occurred [20]. Our findings seem to indicate an important role of small metallic particles as active species for olefin hydroformylation. As already pointed out by other authors [22] for the Rh-Y zeolite sys- tems, we confirm that Rh~(CO)2 species itself would not be considered to be the active species. We extended our investigations to the hydro- genation of carbon monoxide. Recent studies have shown that uniformly dispersed alloys having a predetermined composition can be obtained by controlled thermal decomposition of supported mixed metal carbonyl clusters [23]. Therefore we studied the catalytic properties of bimetallic Fe- Ir particles supported on MgO in methanol syn- thesis from syn-gas, using the mixed Fe-Ir clusters [Et4N] 2[F%Ir4(CO)16] or [ Et4N ] 2 [ Fedr2 (CO) ~2 ] as precursors. Both clus- ters are only weakly physisorbed on MgO, as sug- gested by both their infrared spectra as adsorbed species and their easy extraction from the surface with the solvent used for the impregnation. Treatment of the physisorbed species with a flow of H2 from 298 K to 623 K is needed for the removal of the tetraethyl ammonium cations and of carbonyl ligands with formation of a catalyti- cally active bimetallic phase [ 24]. These cluster-derived catalysts were tested in methanol synthesis from CO + H2 (2:1 ) working at 3.1 MPa and 503 K, and compared to mono- metallic MgO-supported Ir and Fe catalysts pre- pared starting from physisorbed Ir6(CO)16 and Fe(CO)5 carbonyls, respectively. The selectivi- ties after 20 h on stream are showed in Fig. 4. Monometallic iron and iridium catalysts are characterised only by Fischer-Tropsch and water- gas shift activities; on Ir/MgO the selectivity to oxygenates below 27%. On bimetallic cluster- derived catalysts the rate of methanol production is increased by two orders of magnitude when respect to monometallic catalysts, whereas meth- ane is produced to a limited extent. Upon raising the Fe to Ir ratio in the cluster precursor from 2:4 to 2:2, the rates of carbon monoxide conversion and methanol formation almost doubled, the selectivity to oxygenates remaining around 80%. It follows that bimetallic clusters seem to be unique precursors for bimetallic Fe-Ir catalysts characterised by high activity and selectivity to methanol. In fact, by optimising the process con- ditions (temperatures between 488-523 K and HC 100 ~ 8(1 6O 40 ~ 2o II OXY ~ C02 0 Fe Ir Fe21r4 Fe2lr2 Fig. 4.

Carbon mon- oxide conversion ranges from 6 to 15% according to temperatures with methanol productivity of more than 100 mol/moleir, h [24]. In order to explain these observations, the nature of the active sites were investigated by dif- ferent surface techniques [ 24]. H2 chemisorption data on catalysts obtained from bimetallic clusters by hydrogen reduction at 673 K suggest that irid- ium is highly dispersed, without any significant coverage by iron species. Accordingly, prelimi- nary EXAFS investigations on in situ pre-reduced Fe2Ir2-MgO give coordination numbers of around 7.5 for Ir-Ir and 1.4 for Ir-Fe. No evidence for Ir- O contributions is observed. The Ir-Ir coordina- tion number is significantly lower than the corresponding bulk value, which is 12, confirming a high dispersion of iridium particles of dimension around 7-8 .~. The presence of Ir-Fe contributions indicates the presence of bimetallic clusters; the difference between Ir-Ir and Ir-Fe coordination numbers suggests that only a small fraction of the iridium atoms is interacting with iron atoms; the absence of Ir--O contributions is consistent with a structural hypothesis of very small iridium parti- cles stabilised on the MgO surface by interfacial iron atoms. The role of the basic MgO surface is likely to stabilise the anionic cluster precursor, preventing an initial disruption of cluster framework with segregation of iron during the thermal pre- treatment. In agreement with this hypothesis, the [EtaN]2[Fe2Ir4(CO)16] anionic cluster was found to have very low stability when supported on silica. Upon HE pre-treatment, the final cluster- derived catalysts shows only classical Fischer- Tropsch activity and a very low selectivity to methanol (Fig. 5). This remarkable difference from MgO-supported catalyst is probably due to the quick fragmentation on silica of the bimetallic clusters, before the metal particles are formed, with parallel oxidation of the iron fragments by oxidative addition of the surface hydroxyl groups. co 200 ] 'E 160 I \"6 CH4 I CHaOH ~ 40 n- o SiOa MgO Fig. 5.

Chemical vapour deposition in the preparation of mono and bimetallic particles inside zeolite cages The chemical vapour deposition (CVD) has long been used in material science and electronics, but is only slowly gaining acceptance in the catal- ysis community [ 25 ]. Clean and relatively fiat surfaces of monocrys- talline electronic materials have to be replaced by a complex network of small channels in porous, high surface area supports or by the very reactive surfaces of highly basic or highly acidic materials. In addition, the deposition and decomposition steps need to be separated because a proper choice of the decomposition process is required for the optimisation of the topological and electronic properties of the supported metal particles. It fol- lows that chemical vapour deposition as a tech- nique for catalyst preparation is a much more demanding and less controlled task than the clean formation of a thin metallic film on a silicon sur- face. With this in mind we have been able to find few volatile organometallic compounds of the right size and shape which are chemically and thermally stable enough to be deposited from the vapour phase inside the porous structure of zeolites. Many features appear to be particularly prom- ising in the catalysis field. First is the complete absence of protonic sites formed during the reduc- R.

In ion exchanged catalysts, zeolite protons are generated upon hydrogen reduction of the exchanged cations; according to the reaction: M\"+ +n/2H2~MnH+ (M=Pt, Pd etc.) leading to a bifunctional catalyst, with acidic properties. Post neutralatn with aqueous NaOH or by reaction with NaN3 is usually required [ 26], how- ever it is rarely complete and a strict control of experimental conditions is needed for preventing modification of the topology and electronic prop- erties of metallic particles. The second key feature is the absence of any contamination from the impregnation solvents or from undesired dopants - R.O. -O R.E. --i--Conversion 100 o~ 80 E 60 >- 40 20 -\" . _, ,_ ,, , ,lw , 40 80 120 160 200 2O o~ 15 \"~ E C 10 o Time on stream (min) - R.O. -0 R.E --.t--Conversion 100 [ --~o BO I --.--.-__.___._-.---.

Activity and selectivity to ring opening (R.O.) and ring enlargement (R.E.) in MCP reforming at 623 K and 0.1 MPa of Pd/ NaY catalysts obtained: (a) from chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of [Pd(C3Hs)(CsHs)]; (b) from ion-exchange (I.E.) of [Pd(NH3)4] (NO:02. coming from the counter-anions of the added salt (e.g. chlorine or sulphur). The third issue is that the conventionally used steps in supported metal catalyst preparation such as drying, calcination and finally reduction, can be avoided, being sub- stituted by a rather mild reduction process, which can be carried out in situ in the catalytic reactor. This should help to reduce the migration of metal atoms or small metal particles outside the channel, favouring the formation inside the zeolite struc- ture of metal particles with clean surfaces and well controlled size and topology. For instance [Pd(T/3-C3H5) (~75-C5H5) ] (where ~/3-C3H5 is a 7r-allyl ligand and ~75-C5H5 is a 7r-cyclopentadienyl ligand) is a well suited organometallic precursor for CVD inside large- pore zeolites (NAY, KL, NaMor and their acidic counterparts) [ 27 ]. Once deposited inside the zeolite structure it can be decomposed to metallic palladium by mild reduction in flowing hydrogen according to the reaction: H2 [Pd(xl3-C3Hs) ('qS-CsHs) ] ~ pd+ C3H8 + CsHlo which can be followed by temperature pro- grammed decomposition technique (TPRD) [ 7 ]. The highly dispersed, highly active palladium par- ticles produced during the decomposition are effi- cient catalysts for hydrocarbon reforming reactions. In particular, methylcyclopentane (MCP) conversion at 623 K and atmospheric pressure was chosen as model reaction, since it can differentiate monofunctional (metal-only) catalysts from bifunctional ones, where both acidic and metal functions are present [28]. CVD-derived Pd/NaY, which have no acidic sites, shows a quite constant activity and 100% selectivity to ring opening of MCP to n-hexane, 2-methylpentane and 3-methylpentane. Pd/ NaHY obtained by ion-exchange has instead higher initial activity, followed by a faster deac- tivation rate, whilst ring enlargement is the pre- dominant reaction as expected for a true bifunctional catalyst (Fig. 6). 20 R. Ugo et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 13-22 With a neutralised Pd/NaY catalyst obtained by ion-exchange, and subsequent post neutralisa- tion of the protonic acidity, the initial activity is slightly higher with respect to the CVD-based Pd/ NaY catalyst, but a fast deactivation is observed. Selectivity for ring opening is always higher than 96%. In fact, the deactivation process must be ascribed to coke deposition only in the case of bifunctional Pd/NaHY catalyst as shown by a TPO investigation, but another process must be involved in the case of Pd/NaY catalyst obtained by ion exchange followed by neutralisation [ 27 ]. It must be recalled that small Pd clusters are formed and stabilised in the presence of surface protons, which should act as chemical anchors for the growing particles [29]. The neutralisation process removes such anchors; therefore sintering of the original small Pd clusters can become appreciable during actual catalysis at elevated temperatures explaining the decrease in activity for the neutralised Pd catalysts. The same CVD methodology has been applied for the preparation of truly non-acidic Pt/KL cat- alyst for hydrocarbon aromatization. The complex [Pt(hfa)2] (where hfa is the hexafiuoroacetyla- cetonate ligand) has size and shape, volatility and thermal stability good enough to be an excellent molecular precursor for Pt particles. The TPRD investigation in a flow of H2/He shows the evolution of hexafluoroacetylacetone as a single peak at around 538 K according to the reaction: H2 [Pt(hfa) 2]/KL ~ PtKL + 2hfaH(gas~ The removal of ligands and the formation of entrapped metal particles is complete only at around 623 K. This temperature is higher than that needed in the previous case involving Pd, but it is low enough to prevent fast aggregation to large metal particles and to avoid formation of carbon on metal surfaces [ 30]. EXAFS investigations suggest a coordination number of Pt between 5 and 6, which remains constant even after a catalytic test at 773 K, cor- responding to particles of about 7-8 A in diameter [ 31 ]. The structure of entrapped Pt particles was investigated by DRIPTS using chemisorption of CO as a probe. The infrared spectrum is charac- terised by a fine structure and by location of car- bonyl bands at relatively low frequencies, suggesting the formation of carbonyl cluster ani- ons, similar to those of general formula [Pt3(fO)6]n2- (n = 1--4) obtained in basic solu- tions [32]. Therefore it was proposed that very small and electron-rich particles of platinum are formed by the CVD technique in KL zeolites, which are characterised by rather basic sites, which can behave as electron donors. The catalytic activity of Pt/KL in MCP reform- ing is that expected for a platinum catalyst, with total absence of acidic sites. At 623 K the only reaction is the ring opening; while at 773 K ben- zene formation is the major reaction, with an activ- ity rather constant with time on stream. No coke deposition, in agreement with a monofunctional metallic catalyst, is observed by TPO investiga- tion on a used catalyst. This catalyst shows a very high stability, even after two sequential regener- ation cycles of oxidation at 673 K and reduction at 773 K [ 31 ]. Recent EXAFS investigations [ 31 ] show a striking similarity of the structure of the metallic particles before and after the regen- eration cycle, confirming the high stability of entrapped Pt particles. In the oxidised sample it appears that metal particles are still located inside the zeolite cavities, but they are only partially oxi- dised to PtO2. The oxidised part seems to be anchored to the zeolite structure thus inhibiting diffusion of PtOz and large clustering phenomena. The CVD technique can be used also for the preparation of unusual mono or bimetallic phases inside zeolites. Intrazeolite redox chemistry of Mn2 + cation is practically absent in the case of conventional ion-exchanged materials, because of the very high stability of the Mn2 ion. On the contrary the neutral and volatile Mn2(CO)~o car- bonyl species can be deposited by CVD inside NaY cavities and then decomposed via mild ther- mal removal of CO under inert or hydrogen atmos- phere [ 33 ]. TPD experiments show that a metallic R. Ugo et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 13-22 21 zerovalent manganese phase cannot be obtained, since the decarbonylation process is immediately followed by oxidation to MnO with parallel H2 evolution in the presence of traces of water. Mn2(CO) ~o ~ 2Mn+ 10CO 2Mn+ 2H20 --* 2MnO + H2 A redox chemistry takes place inside the zeo- lite: MnO can be reduced by CO to generate rather stable intrazeolitic manganese carbonyls (proba- bly Mnor Mn~), while oxidation of MnO to Mn203 is a facile process, which can be easily reversed by monoelectronic hydrogen reduction below 723 K. With this approach a bimetallic Rh/ Mn phase, with the surface presumably enriched in Mn, can be obtained by CVD deposition of Mn2(CO)m on Rh particles entrapped inside a NaY zeolite followed by reduction with H2. Con- ventional H2 reduction of the ions Rh3 + and Mn2 + exchanged inside the same zeolite leads instead to the formation of rhodium carbonyl species inter- acting with Mn2+ ions [34]. It follows that CVD can be a technique to pre- pare bimetallic particles, which can not be easily obtained by traditional techniques. For instance CVD proved to be the most convenient way for preparing zeolite-entrapped rhenium particles from Re2 (CO) m, since exchange of the bulky cat- ion [ReOz(en)] + (en=ethylendiamine) is a slow process and carbide species are formed upon drastic reduction poisoning the metal surface [351. Bimetallic Pt/Re particles, entrapped inside the supercages of a NaY zeolite, are easily obtained by CVD deposition of Re2 (CO) m on prereduced Pt particles acting as nucleation sites for the decomposition of the metal carbonyl [ 8]. These alloy particles are characterised by a high selectivity for deep hydrogenolysis of n-heptane to methane, much higher than that of the single Re and Pt metal catalyst. Interestingly the bime- tallic PtRe2(CO)12 cluster carbonyl can not be used as precursor of alloy particles. It is too big to easily enter the windows interconnecting the supercages and most is left at the external surface of the zeolite crystals, where phase separation and Re segregation occur as on an A1203 surface [ 36]. 4. Conclusions Organometallic compounds, either large molecular metal clusters or volatile mononuclear species, are demonstrated to be suitable and flex- ible precursors for preparing highly dispersed metal particles supported on metal oxides and zeo- lites. This approach is leading to new mono and bimetallic catalysts that have potential technolog- ical advantages over conventionally prepared systems. The metal phase is usually obtained by simple ligand removal under mild conditions, preventing, at a large extent, sintering to large crystallites or carbide formation. CVD-based catalysts showed the additional advantage of a very clean metal phase, due to the absence of any contamination from solvents or anions containing halogens or sulphur. These molecular organometallic-based cata- lysts are often structurally well-defined and there- fore amenable to detailed spectroscopic characterization. These model materials are also offering good opportunities for understanding structure and reactivity in industrial supported metal catalysts.

Fax: (+39-2)2362748 Specific studies carried in Milan laboratory in the application of metal carbonyl clusters to preparation of supported catalysts are reviewed. Examples are reported of catalysis by heterogeneous organometallic surface species, such as 1-butene isomerisation catalysed by silica-anchored osmium carbonyl species, or of catalysis by very small metal particles produced under catalytic conditions, such as ethylene hydroformylation using silica supported [Rh12(CO)30]2− as precursor. Highly active bimetallic FeIr MgO catalysts for methanol synthesis, have been pr prepared by controlled reductive decomposition of physisorbed [Et4N]2[Fe2Ir4(CO)16] and [Et4N]2[Fe2Ir2(CO)12] clusters. In these examples, evidence of the nature of the catalytic entities is reached by in situ DRIFTS characterisation under catalytic conditions or using EXAFS measurements. Metal particles deposited inside the zeolitic cavities have been obtained by mild reduction conditions of entrapped organometallic compounds introduced by chemical vapour deposition (CVD). In this way, non-acidic Pt KL , Pd NaY catalysts for hydrocarbon reforming have been prepared. Bimetallic Pt Re and Rh Mn particles, entrapped inside a NaY zeolite, have been easily obtained by CVD of M2(CO)10 carbonyls (M  Re, Mn) on pre-reduced metal particles.

        "dc:description": "Specific studies carried in Milan laboratory in the application of metal carbonyl clusters to preparation of supported catalysts are reviewed. Examples are reported of catalysis by heterogeneous organometallic surface species, such as 1-butene isomerisation catalysed by silica-anchored osmium carbonyl species, or of catalysis by very small metal particles produced under catalytic conditions, such as ethylene hydroformylation using silica supported [Rh12(CO)30]2− as precursor. Highly active bimetallic FeIr MgO catalysts for methanol synthesis, have been pr prepared by controlled reductive decomposition of physisorbed [Et4N]2[Fe2Ir4(CO)16] and [Et4N]2[Fe2Ir2(CO)12] clusters. In these examples, evidence of the nature of the catalytic entities is reached by in situ DRIFTS characterisation under catalytic conditions or using EXAFS measurements. Metal particles deposited inside the zeolitic cavities have been obtained by mild reduction conditions of entrapped organometallic compounds introduced by chemical vapour deposition (CVD). In this way, non-acidic Pt KL , Pd NaY catalysts for hydrocarbon reforming have been prepared. Bimetallic Pt Re and Rh Mn particles, entrapped inside a NaY zeolite, have been easily obtained by CVD of M2(CO)10 carbonyls (M  Re, Mn) on pre-reduced metal particles.",
