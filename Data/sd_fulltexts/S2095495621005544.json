Graphical abstract In situ investigations of lithium batteries show that solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and ion intercalation are highly dependent on the concentration and composition of electrolyte, and provide strategies for the modulation of battery performance The formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and ion intercalation are two key processes in rechargeable batteries, which need to be explored under dynamic operating conditions. In this work, both planar and sandwich model lithium batteries consisting of Li metal | ionic liquid electrolyte | graphite electrode have been constructed and investigated by a series of in situ surface analysis platforms including atomic force microscopy, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It is found that the choice of electrolyte, including the concentration and contents, has a profound effect on the SEI formation and evolution, and the subsequent ion intercalation. A smooth and compact SEI is preferably produced in high-concentration electrolytes, with FSI− salt superior to TFSI− salt, facilitating the lithiation/delithiation to achieve high capacity and excellent cycle stability, while suppressing the co-intercalation of electrolyte solvent ions. The innovative research scenario of well-defined model batteries in combination with multiple genuinely in situ surface analysis methods presented herein leads to insightful results, which provide valuable strategies for the rational design and optimization of practical batteries, and energy storage devices in general. Keywords Lithium ion batteries Solid electrolyte interphase Ion intercalation In situ surface characterization Ionic liquid electrolyte Introduction The excessive consumption of fossil fuels and the resulting environmental deterioration have led to the urgent need of developing the next generation of sustainable energy storage and conversion systems [1–5]. Among the existing rechargeable devices, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have an unrivalled combination of high energy density and reasonably good power density, and become indispensable in a diversity of applications from consumer electronics to electric vehicles [6–9]. Many surface/interface reactions occur during the operation of LIBs, such as the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces and (de)intercalation of ions in the electrodes. They play crucial roles in the device performance, thereby attracting considerable research interest [10–12]. Although traditional surface characterization techniques, such as ex situ scanning probe microscopy and electron spectroscopy, have been widely used to probe the interfaces, they are unable to provide real time structural and compositional changes under operational conditions. In contrast, in situ/operando surface-sensitive techniques allow to correlate the applied reaction conditions with surface changes, unveiling the structure-composition-activity relationships. For example, in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) can capture the dynamic morphology evolution in a qualitative and quantitative manner and even the molecular arrangement in electric double layers, and in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) can continuously visualize the intercalation and deintercalation of ions in electrodes [13–15]. These correlative measurements can provide a holistic understanding of reaction processes and further guide the device design and optimization. The active electrode materials in real batteries are usually dispersed by other ingredients such as conductive agents and binders, and meanwhile, the whole electrodes are buried by abundant electrolytes. Therefore, the electrodes in practical batteries are hardly accessible by surface probes. In this regard, model batteries need to be constructed to expose open and well-defined electrode surfaces for in situ/operando surface science measurements, while still maintaining the capability of mimicking the performance of real batteries. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have large and flat surfaces, and most importantly, their layered structures render them suitable for use as intercalation hosts in batteries. Many 2D structures have been extensively studied in the field of LIBs, such as graphene [16–18], MXene [19–21] and MoS2 [22–24]. Ionic liquids (ILs) are composed entirely of cations and anions, in which cations can be imidazolium, piperidinium and pyrrolidinium, and anions include bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI−), bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI−), etc. They are a class of commonly-used electrolytes for electrochemical devices due to their unique properties, such as nonflammability, high thermal stability and wide electrochemical windows [25–27]. In addition, the low vapor pressure of ILs makes them ideal to be used in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV)-compatible model batteries for in situ characterizations by electron microscopy [28,29]. To this end, model batteries consisting of 2D graphite electrodes and IL electrolytes should provide an ideal platform for in situ characterizations by UHV-based surface science techniques. These approaches can address the key reaction processes dynamically occurring at electrode/electrolyte interfaces, as represented by the formation of SEI and ion intercalation. It has been reported that by varying the type of solvent, anion, additives and concentration of the electrolyte, the SEI structure can be manipulated to affect the desolvation and intercalation of Li ions, and consequently the overall performance of LIBs [30–32]. In particular, extensive effort has been devoted to creating the highly stable interphases by increasing electrolyte concentrations [31,33]. In this work, correlative characterizations including in situ AFM, Raman and XPS measurements were carried out on a couple of model batteries during the operation to elucidate the electrolyte effect on the device performance. It is found that in high-concentration electrolytes (HCE), a flat and dense SEI film can be readily produced, leading to good reversibility and cycle stability. The battery performance is further enhanced by the use of FSI−-containing salt, superior to that with TFSI−-based salt. Moreover, the composition analysis indicates that this SEI derived from the high-concentration electrolyte contains more inorganic components including Li2S, LiF and Li3N, which are generated mainly from the reduction process of FSI−. This tailored production can promote lithium ion diffusion to increase the amount of intercalated lithium ions, while inhibiting the subsequent solvent intercalation. Experimental Materials and chemicals The as-received lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI, Aldrich, purity > 99.95%) and lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI, Suzhou Fluolyte Co., Ltd, China, purity > 99.5%) were used as the electrolyte salts without further purification. 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (EMImFSI, Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, CAS) was utilized as the electrolyte solvent. After the heat treatment at 130 °C for 12 h under a pressure of 10−5 Pa, EMImFSI was then mixed with LiTFSI and LiFSI, respectively, to prepare electrolytes of 0.32 mol kg−1 (0.48 M) LiTFSI/EMImFSI, 0.32 mol kg−1 (0.48 M) LiFSI/EMImFSI, and 1.60 mol kg−1 (2.40 M) LiFSI/EMImFSI. Hereafter, the two concentrations were referred to as LCE (low-concentration electrolyte) and HCE (high-concentration electrolyte), respectively, to examine the concentration effect. Cationic and anionic structures of the investigated electrolytes are illustrated in Fig. S1, and the corresponding XPS spectra for C 1s, F 1s, N 1s, O 1s, S 2p and Li 1s of the above electrolytes are shown in Figs. S2–S4. In LiTFSI/EMImFSI, C–N, C–C bonds for EMIm+, C-F bond for TFSI−, F-S bond for FSI−, OS bond and N− species for TFSI− and FSI− are detected. When the LiTFSI salt is replaced with LiFSI, the signal for C-F bond is almost negligible. Note that the presence of LiF in Figs. S3 and S4 can be due to minor electrolyte decomposition introduced by elongated X-ray exposure. Assembly of model batteries and coin cells Two types of model batteries were fabricated for in situ characterizations in this work: the planar and sandwich batteries. For both cases, lithium metal (China Energy Lithium Co., Ltd, purity >99.9%) acted as the anode after being gently polished. In the planar battery, a graphite flake with a thickness of ∼50 μm, which was exfoliated from highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG; ZYB grade, Bruker) using the Scotch tape method, was adopted as the cathode. This substrate can provide a flat and well-defined surface (consisting of basal plane and step edges) for AFM characterization. In the sandwich battery, a sample of 500 nm graphite grown on nickel (XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd, China) was etched in 1 M FeCl3 solution to provide pristine graphite layers, serving as the cathode. The sample is clean and ultrathin, allowing for sufficient intercalation and subsequent evaluation by the penetrating laser or X-ray. An anodic aluminum oxide membrane (AAO, Whatman), with an average thickness and an aperture size of 60 μm and 200 nm, respectively, was laser-cut into an appropriate size and then impregnated with the electrolyte of interest before being used as the separator. The porous AAO has the capacity to hold the electrolyte, acting as the reservoir, which is positioned below the graphite layers. The scenario can minimize the possible interference of electrolyte with the surface characterizations concurrently carried out during battery operation, such as in situ Raman and in situ XPS measurements. Coin-type cells comprising graphite powders (particle size ∼150 μm, Qingdao Huatai Lubricant Sealing S&T Co. Ltd., Qingdao, China) and electrolytes of interest were assembled. The mass ratio of the active graphitic material, acetylene black and the binder (PVDF, poly(vinylidene fluoride)) was 8:1:1. They were mixed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and then pasted onto the surface of a Cu foil current collector. The coated electrode was dried at 100 °C for 24 h in vacuum. A Li metal foil was used as the anode. The coin-type cell fabrication was done inside an Ar-filled glove box. Characterization techniques A CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai, China) was utilized on model batteries to perform cyclic voltammograms (CVs) in the range of 3.00 to 0 V at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1, chronoamperometry measurements at 0.80, 0.50 and 0 V (each for 4 h to reach a steady state) and galvanostatic charge and discharge (GCD) measurements under 0.01 C at a voltage interval from 3.00 to 0 V. GCD profiles of coin-type cells were performed on a LAND CT2001A analyzer under 0.1 C at a voltage interval from 3.00 to 0.001 V. In situ AFM measurements were carried out in the region of the HOPG flake immersed in the electrolyte, using the planar battery configuration. The characterization was conducted in tapping mode (the set point amplitude is about 60% of the free amplitude) on a Cypher ES AFM (Asylum Research, Oxford Instruments, USA), situated in an Ar-filled glove box (H2O, O2 < 0.5 ppm). In situ Raman characterization was performed on the 500 nm ultrathin graphite electrode in the sandwich battery format, using a custom-made cell with a quartz window. The cell was assembled in the Ar-filled glove box and two copper wires were used to connect the working electrode (WE) and the counter/reference electrode (CE/RE) contact pins, respectively, while avoiding the contact with the electrolyte-impregnated separator. Raman spectra were recorded with a LabRAM HR 800 Raman spectrometer using 532 nm laser (0.25 mW) and a 50× objective. The typical acquisition rate was 24 s per spectrum. The regime of Raman data obtained in this work was 1100–1800 cm−1. All the spectra were calibrated with a Si single crystal at 520.7 cm−1. In situ XPS measurements were performed on the sandwich battery, using a SPECS XPS spectrometer equipped with an Mg Kα X-ray source (1253.6 eV at 200 W) and a PHOIBOS 100 hemispherical energy analyzer. Survey and core level spectra were recorded under UHV condition (P < 10−8 mbar) with pass energies of 10 and 30 eV, respectively. Data analysis was performed using the Casa-XPS software with a Shirley background and 70/30 Gaussian-Lorentzian fits. Some complementary quasi in situ and ex situ characterizations were also done, while a graphite flake exfoliated from HOPG as described above served as the cathode in the sandwich battery. The morphologies and elemental distribution of the formed SEI were characterized by AFM and high-resolution SEM (JSM-7900F, Japan). After the application of constant potentials of 0.80, 0.50 and 0 V (each for four hours), the HOPG flake was dismantled from the battery and rinsed with dimethyl carbonate (DMC, Dodochem, battery grade, 99.99%) to remove the residual ionic liquid. Subsequently, the top layers were peeled off to remove the SEI and thus expose the bulk part for elemental analysis by XPS, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) (Shimadzu ICPS-8100, Horiba, Japan) and O/N/H elemental analyzer (EMGA-930, Horiba, Japan). The pristine HOPG sample free from electrochemical treatments was used as the control. Regarding the quasi in situ XPS, the electrochemically-treated HOPG was also rinsed with DMC and then characterized on the surface or at various depths, subject to different Ar+ plasma etching time. Results and discussion Model batteries of Li | IL electrolyte | graphite Two kinds of model batteries, the planar and sandwich types, were constructed using IL species for different characterization purposes. For the planar LIB model device used for in situ AFM characterization (Fig. 1 a and Fig. S5a, c), a freshly exfoliated HOPG flake and a lithium foil (∼10 × 10 mm2, 0.5 mm thick) were placed in the same plane on a flat substrate. Subsequently, a droplet of the UHV-compatible IL electrolyte was placed onto the gap between them, while partially covering both of the electrodes. Alternatively, a 500 nm ultrathin graphite (multilayer graphene) electrode, a separator filled with IL electrolyte, and a lithium foil were stacked together to create a sandwich-like LIB model device (Fig. 1b and Fig. S5b, d), which was adopted for in situ Raman and XPS characterizations. Note that there is almost no electrolyte contact on the outer surface of the 500 nm ultrathin graphite electrode in this sandwich model battery, allowing the continuous XPS and Raman measurements to be performed without the interference of electrolyte and formed SEI layers. Fig. 1(c and d) displays the CVs obtained from the planar and sandwich model batteries using the electrolyte of 0.32 mol kg−1 LiTFSI/EMImFSI, respectively. In order to provide a straightforward comparison, the results are presented in normalized currents (i.e., the actual currents are divided by the maxima for the 1st CV scans). It can be seen that the two model batteries show slightly different electrochemical behaviors. In the first CV scans of the two devices, a pronounced reduction peak is observed, which can be ascribed to the reduction/decomposition of electrolyte and intercalation of the electrolyte solvent cations (i.e., EMIm+ in this case) [34,35], leading to the formation of SEI [36]. During the reverse scan, there is a broad oxidation peak, possibly associated with the deintercalation of the IL solvent cations [37]. The areas of the oxidation peaks are much smaller than those of the reduction peaks, further highlighting the hypothesis that the sharp reduction peak is dominated by electrolyte decomposition and even due to the irreversible deintercalation of IL ions. It should be noted that in comparison to the sandwich battery using 500 nm ultrathin graphite, the HOPG arranged in the planar battery manner demonstrates a more negative reduction peak, and subsequently a more positive oxidation peak on the CV. This distinct behavior is possibly due to the slow motion of ions in thick stack samples [38–43], where defect concentration, morphology and surface groups can play a significant role [37,38,44,45]. The reduction and oxidation peaks decrease dramatically in the successive cycles, which indicates that the presence of SEI layer suppresses the further consumption of electrolyte. Moreover, in the two cases herein, the peaks of lithium intercalation (below 0.20 V) [41,46,47] and deintercalation are much less notable in the LCE of 0.32 mol kg−1 LiTFSI/EMImFSI. In the following sections, the two model batteries were adopted for in situ surface/interface characterizations to simultaneously investigate the interfacial properties during battery charge and discharge. Formation, evolution and compositions of SEI at the interface Dynamic surface morphology changes of the HOPG electrode under electrochemical conditions can be evaluated by in situ AFM using the planar battery configuration, with the tip positioned in the region of electrolyte-wetted graphite surface. Fig. 2 a illustrates a pristine HOPG surface at the open circuit voltage (OCV; ca. 2.81 V), comprising basal plane and step edge (∼0.35 nm) structures. Upon the introduction of polarization, tiny nanoparticles begin to appear at ∼1.11 V during the discharge (Fig. 2b), indicative of the formation of SEI. Of note, with the discharge from 1.01 to 0.85 V, the nanoparticles-like motif grows rapidly, mainly along the steps, while the aggregates cover part of the basal plane terraces. With the continuous polarization to more negative potentials, as shown in Fig. 2(c and d), the SEI layer gradually spreads to the entire electrode surface, leading to a relatively rough and porous layer (as evident by the high-resolution image shown in Fig. 2e). Note that the brightly broad blister (pointed out by the arrow) is a result of the intercalation and decomposition of electrolyte cations, implying the curling and exfoliation of HOPG electrode [11,34,35,48]. In the subsequent charge process shown in Fig. 2(f and g), some of the product species on the surface slowly disappear compared with Fig. 2d, which means that the SEI may be partially re-dissolved during the reverse scan. The thickness of a representative SEI formed after 3 CV cycles is measured to be about 20 nm (Fig. 2h). To probe the composition of the SEI generated on the HOPG flake, post-mortem XPS was carried out. Three CV cycles were recorded in the planar battery to ensure an effective formation of SEI film at the interface. Thereafter, the flake was disassembled from the battery and extensively cleaned by DMC, before being transferred to the XPS chamber without exposure to air. The wide-scan XPS spectrum shows the presence of F, O, N, C, S and Li elements in the SEI investigated herein (Fig. S6), in which the existence of F, O and S implied the breakdown of TFSI− or FSI− in the electrolyte [49]. The individual elements were further studied with narrow scan spectra. As shown in Fig. 2i, the S 2p peaks appearing at 170.2, 167.8, 164.1 and 161.8 eV indicate the existence of -SO2F, -SOx-, Li2S and S-S species, respectively [31,50]. Peaks located at 689.8, 688.1 and 685.7 eV in the F 1s spectrum show the existence of C-F, -SO2F and LiF [50]. In the N 1s spectrum, there are three peaks at 402.3, 400.3 and 398.4 eV representing C-N, N-SO2F and Li3N, respectively [50]. The Li 1s peak located at 56.6 eV reveals the presence of LiF and other lithium-containing compounds [31]. Overall, inorganic substances such as Li2S, LiF, Li3N and organic substances containing C-F, C-N bonds are found in the SEI layer. Co-intercalation behavior of electrolyte solvent inside the electrode Next, the sandwich battery was utilized for evaluating the ion intercalation behavior under operating conditions. The combination of ultrathin graphite sample and clean (free from electrolyte immersion and possible SEI formation) electrode surface allows in situ Raman spectroscopy to be performed. When the battery is discharged from 3.00 V to ca. 0.85 V (Fig. 3 a), the characteristic G band of pristine graphite (denoted as Guc, uncharged state) at ∼1583 cm−1, corresponding to the in-plane vibration of carbon atoms in the interior graphite layers, gradually decreases and shifts to a higher position (at ∼1605 cm−1, denoted as Gc) [37]. This new band is assigned to the bounding graphite layers in close vicinity to the layers of intercalated ions [34,35,37]. Meanwhile, the signals attributed to the IL at 1423 and 1219 cm−1 (marked by the arrows in Fig. 3a; cf. Fig. S7) also start to appear along with the Gc peak, which unambiguously confirms the occurrence of EMIm+ and FSI− intercalation [51–53]. This is consistent with the reduction peaks observed in Fig. 1(c and d), indicating that the reduction current here is caused not only by the decomposition of electrolyte, but also by the intercalation of IL species. With the continuous decrease of the applied potential (typically < 0.20 V) in the discharge process, the Gc band gradually shrinks, at which stage it is increasingly dominated by the intercalation of Li+ [41,46,47]. To further assess the intercalating species, Li | IL electrolyte | HOPG batteries were held at 0.80 and 0 V, each for 4 h. Thereafter, the topmost layers of HOPG electrodes were peeled off to remove the SEI film, and the bulk of the sample was then taken for elemental analysis of N and Li. As shown in Fig. 3b, compared with the fresh sample (pristine HOPG electrode), the N content from the treated HOPG increases from 0.04 wt% to 0.19 wt% at 0.80 V, whereas the Li amount is still negligible (0.005 wt%). The enrichment of N element is due to the decomposition/intercalation of electrolyte. At 0 V, the Li content is further increased by almost one order of magnitude, which indicates that a large number of lithium ions intercalate into the electrode at this potential accompanied by the two-fold enhancement for N. The chemical compositions of the intercalants can be more clearly elucidated by employing in situ XPS on the outer side of the graphite electrode, since this sandwich model battery can prevent the characterization from the interference of the formed SEI and bulk electrolyte, which are enclosed in the battery. During the discharge, the S 2p and F 1s spectra in Fig. 3(c and d) illustrate the presence of FSI−, which is consistent with the Raman result (the intercalation of TFSI− is excluded since there is no C-F bond in the C 1s spectra shown in Fig. S8). N 1s spectrum in Fig. 3e shows the coexistence of N+ and N−, which means the co-intercalation of solvent containing both EMIm+ and FSI− [54,55]. Therefore, the intercalation of EMIm+ and FSI− together with Li+ is unambiguously confirmed by the increment of S, F, N and Li elements at 0.80 V. With the progress of the discharge, the areas of intercalation species are gradually increasing, as demonstrated in Fig. 3(c–f), which also agrees with the above-mentioned in situ Raman results. The co-adsorption of EMIm+ and FSI− onto the graphite electrode surface is reasonable considering the combination of electrostatic force, chemical force and global electroneutrality, which can be a prerequisite to further intercalation of the cations and anions into the electrodes [14,34,56,57]. In summary, the SEI formed in the LCE of LiTFSI/EMImFSI is unable to prevent the intercalation of solvent ions, possibly resulting in the exfoliation of the HOPG structure (Fig. 2 and Fig. S9). The effect of electrolyte salt concentration and anion Previous studies have demonstrated that the concentration of electrolyte salt has a significant impact on the formation of SEI layer [31,33,58–62] and concentrated electrolytes also help to alleviate the corrosion issue of metal current collectors (e.g., stainless steel and Al) [63–66]. Indeed, in our experiments, when the concentration of electrolyte salt is increased, dramatically distinct CV curves are acquired (Fig. S10). More reversible intercalation and deintercalation of Li+ with enhanced currents are observed after the first scan, at the expense of the sharp decrease of the reduction peak in the following cycles. In the HCE of LiTFSI/EMImFSI, this peak should be mainly accounted for by the one-time decomposition of electrolyte solvent accompanied by minimal intercalation of the electrolyte solvent cations (as indicated by the negligible oxidation peak). This is further validated by the in situ optical microscopic observation that almost negligible exfoliation of HOPG is introduced (Fig. S11). Moreover, it has been reported that FSI− can improve the Li+ transport and inhibit the intercalation of electrolyte solvent cations [48]. In this regard, LiFSI was also adopted as an alternative electrolyte salt in EMImFSI for evaluating the performance of model batteries. Similarly, 0.32 mol kg−1 LiFSI/EMImFSI was used as LCE, while 1.60 mol kg−1 LiFSI/EMImFSI was used as HCE. Fig. 4 a displays three successive CV curves of the HOPG electrode in the HCE of 1.60 mol kg−1 LiFSI/EMImFSI. The striking reduction peak only exists in the first cycle and very reversible intercalation/deintercalation of Li+ is seen in the following scans (Fig. S12), while no deintercalation peaks for EMIm+ are observed, in sharp contrast to the LCE condition. These results are analogous to the behaviors observed for LiTFSI salt (Fig. S10), but the lithiation/delithiation is more vigorous with the use of LiFSI. Next, the HOPG electrodes were polarized at 0.50 and 0 V (each for 4 h) under the LCE and HCE conditions, respectively, and then exfoliated to remove the SEI and expose the underlying layers for post-mortem XPS measurements. Li 1s spectra of the exfoliated HOPG electrodes verify that more lithium ions intercalate into HOPG electrodes under the HCE condition, with the decrease of potential, as shown in Fig. 4(b and c). Moreover, the Li element concentrations of the exfoliated HOPG electrodes measured by ICP-AES after the treatments of 0.50 and 0 V respectively under the HCE condition are much higher than those for LCE (Fig. S13). These results suggest the stable passivation layer of SEI formed on the electrode in HCE can facilitate the insertion of Li+ ions, while impeding further intercalation of IL ions, thereby leading to a reversible consumption of charges between the cathodic and anodic scans [37]. It should be highlighted that due to the favored reversible Li+ intercalation/deintercalation under the HCE condition, an improved cycle stability and a higher capacity for the model battery are evident from the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves (Fig. S14). To further investigate the enhanced electrochemical performance of batteries using HCE, AFM and SEM measurements were performed on the electrode scanned 3 times respectively under the LCE and HCE conditions to ensure the complete formation of an SEI layer. Fig. 4(d-g) shows that tiny particle-like features corresponding to the SEI appear in both LCE and HCE cases (enlarged images of Fig. 4d-e shown in Fig. S15). However, a coarse and loose SEI is derived from LCE, incapable of stopping the co-intercalation of electrolyte solvent, resulting in possible exfoliation of the HOPG electrode as described above. As a comparison, the HCE of LiFSI/EMImFSI facilitates the production of a smooth and compact SEI film, which would be more conductive for the intercalation of lithium ions, distinct from the LCE condition and the situation using TFSI− salt (cf. Fig. S10 and S12) [48]. In order to distinguish the compositions of the SEI films formed under the LCE and HCE conditions using LiFSI/EMImFSI, the cycled HOPG electrodes were characterized by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). As shown in Fig. 4(h and i) and Fig. S16, the SEI formed under the HCE condition contains more F, S and O elements than that from LCE condition. Since these elements are only present in FSI− of the electrolyte, it can be concluded that FSI− promotes the SEI formation [67–69]. The elemental depth profiles of the SEI were further examined by XPS measurements, in combination with time-varying Ar+ sputtering treatments. Similar to the case utilizing LiTFSI (Fig. 2i), inorganic (such as Li2S, LiF and Li3N) and organic substances (e.g., C-F and C-N) are also found in the SEI grown under both LCE and HCE conditions containing LiFSI salt (Fig. 5 ). It can be clearly seen that the contents of Li2S, LiF and Li3N increase within the first two minutes of Ar+ sputtering while the contents of C-F and C-N decrease. These results imply that the SEI layer towards the electrolyte side possesses more organic substances, while the other side in contact with the graphite electrode has more inorganic species. It is worth noting that for the whole range of sputtering time investigated here, the produced SEI containing more Li2S, LiF and Li3N in percentages under HCE condition than in LCE (Fig. 5c-e), which is dominated by the reduction of FSI− [54,67–69]. This can be accounted for by the enhanced coordination between FSI− and Li+ and the change of EMIm+ solvation induced by the enriched Li+ in HCE, as evident by Fig. S17 [59]. These inorganic components tend to generate thin and compact SEI layers [70,71], associated with excellent mechanical properties and thermal endurability [53]. Overall, our characterization results highlight the crucial role of electrolyte salt in the formation of SEI layers. The smooth and compact SEI formed in HCE condition is more beneficial to battery devices by allowing for the diffusion of lithium ions and simultaneously inhibiting the co-intercalation of electrolyte solvents, thereby resulting in more reversible electrochemical charge and discharge processes [53,58,68,72–77]. As a further exploration of the insight obtained from model batteries, coin-type devices comprising graphite powders were also assembled and examined using LCE and HCE of LiFSI/EMImFSI as the electrolytes, respectively. The galvanostatic charge–discharge experiment performed at 0.1 C shows a high discharge capacity with a low coulombic efficiency in the first cycle, almost independent of the LiFSI concentration (Fig. S18). In the subsequent cycles, the cell under HCE conditions demonstrates outstanding coulombic efficiency and cyclability compared to that with LCE conditions. Moreover, the HCE exhibits a higher capacity of 324 mAh g−1 recorded after 30 scans, in comparison to 257 mAh g−1 seen for the LCE system. Conclusion A comprehensive investigation of the influence of electrolyte salt concentration and anion on the formation of SEI layers and ion intercalation behaviors in batteries has been carried out. By fabricating model batteries compatible with a myriad of surface science techniques, a combination of various in situ characterization measurements can be readily done to provide valuable information about the structure-composition-performance relationship of the electrochemical devices. In terms of the LCE and HCE conditions, a coarse and loose SEI is formed in LCE, enabling irreversible Li intercalation/deintercalation, accompanied by co-intercalation of electrolyte solvent and subsequent serious exfoliation of HOPG electrode. In contrast, a smooth and compact SEI film can be created under the HCE condition, which facilitates lithium ion motion but hinders the occurrence of solvent intercalation. This effect is further enhanced by replacing TFSI−-containing salt with FSI−-based species to manipulate the formation of a stable SEI layer to ultimately improve device capacity and cycle stability, while maintaining the integrity of the electrode structure, without the electrode exfoliation by electrolyte solvent. The study presented herein provides powerful surface characterization tools for capturing the real picture of electrochemical processes during battery operation, thereby generating deep insights into the surface/interface processes of the SEI formation and ion intercalation behaviors under different electrolyte conditions.

        "dc:description": "The formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and ion intercalation are two key processes in rechargeable batteries, which need to be explored under dynamic operating conditions. In this work, both planar and sandwich model lithium batteries consisting of Li metal | ionic liquid electrolyte | graphite electrode have been constructed and investigated by a series of in situ surface analysis platforms including atomic force microscopy, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It is found that the choice of electrolyte, including the concentration and contents, has a profound effect on the SEI formation and evolution, and the subsequent ion intercalation. A smooth and compact SEI is preferably produced in high-concentration electrolytes, with FSI− salt superior to TFSI− salt, facilitating the lithiation/delithiation to achieve high capacity and excellent cycle stability, while suppressing the co-intercalation of electrolyte solvent ions. The innovative research scenario of well-defined model batteries in combination with multiple genuinely in situ surface analysis methods presented herein leads to insightful results, which provide valuable strategies for the rational design and optimization of practical batteries, and energy storage devices in general.",
