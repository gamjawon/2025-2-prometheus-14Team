Dominique Vanhove * Laboratoire de G~nie Chimique et d'Automalique - JE 235, Ecole Centrale de Lille et E.N.S.C.L., BP 48, 5965! Villeneuve d'Ascq Cedex, France Received 24 July 1995; accepted 20 October 1995 Abstract Recent trends in catalysis have emerged using new processes and new raw materials in order to reduce the number of steps leading from petroleum distillates to chemical intermediates. Selective activation of the strong C-H bonds present in alkanes by catalytic action of oxygen is a stimulating challenge and new efficient catalysts have appeared in some cases. Nevertheless, the selective materials exhibit very low activities and low selectivities at high hydrocarbon conver- sion. Extreme conditions (partial pressures, residence time) are, thus, chosen to improve the production rate, which can have dramatic consequences on the real working conditions of the catalytic surface, when laboratory tests are performed. Catalytic oxidation of isobutane forming methacrylic acid was chosen as an example and compared to oldest and 'classical' mild oxidations. It is shown that in micro-reactors, in apparent isothermal and differential operation, extreme thermal gradients between the catalyst surface and fluid can develop. Moreover, whatever the kinetics and thermal exchange, the search for productivity announced in patents causes runaway in all cases without external evidence. These effects could lead to an erroneous interpretation of results in terms of kinetics and mechanisms, to drastic decreases in selectivities and therefore to the rejection of the most active catalysts due to a low apparent selectivity which could be a consequence of poor testing conditions. Simulation of different reactor geometry shows that industrial-like pilot plants could be more stable and more selective than micro-reactors. The increase of catalytic bed volume appears as a major positive factor in this objective. The screening of catalysts for these new reactions must thus be carried out with extreme care in the choice of experimental parameters.

Introduction Recent trends in catalysis lead to the use of new processes and new raw materials in accordance with constraints relating to economy, energy, strategy, safety or environment. These new processes aim at reducing the number of steps leading from petroleum distillates to petrochemicals and chemical intermediates, such as monomers. In that respect, the selective activation of strong C-H bonds in alkanes is a stimulating challenge and new efficient catalysts have appeared for some transformations. These catalysts present strong acidity to obtain initial activation of the hydrocarbon but such properties can also lead to the degradation of valuable intermediates. In the case of functionalisation by catalytic oxidation, light alkanes (C~-C4) could be used for olefin synthesis or replace aromatics and olefins (i.e., benzene, propene, isobutene) in the production of unsaturated aldehydes or acids (acrolein, methacrolein, acrylic and methacrylic acids) [1-8] and maleic anhydride [9,10]. Industrial application is effective in the latter case starting from n-butane. In such reactions, the critical and limiting step is the alkane oxidative dehydrogenation. The reactivity of n-butane, which is greater than that of lighter hydrocarbons, and the great stability of the anhydride form make it possible to keep high selectivity at conversions as high as 90%. For the other syntheses, the relative ability of acid surfaces to crack and oxidize olefins, aldehydes and acids -- thus forming acetic acid and carbon oxides -- leads to a rapid decrease in selectivity when conversion is forced. Moreover, the transformation rate remains quite low in comparison with the one usually observed in the oxidation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The highest yields are, thus, obtained in the conver- sion range 10%-20% and at high residence times. Nevertheless, in spite of these unusual conditions and in a few marginal cases, industrial cost efficiency can be assured by using recirculation of unre- acted hydrocarbons, after condensation of liquid products. In this case, nitrogen (from air) and gaseous products are circulating together with the unconverted hydrocarbon fraction in the loop, diluting the feed; the lower the reactor conversion is, the lower the reagent concentration at the inlet will be, with the consequence of bringing productivity down and energy costs up. To ensure sufficient productivity per reactor volume unit, an increase in the reaction rate and a minimisation of passive components in the feed are sought by increasing the partial pressure in the limiting reagent, alkane. So, numerous patents report, for C~-C4 oxidation, partial pressures in the feed as high as 0.15-0.3 atm, that is to say above the highest explosion limit. These experimental conditions have major consequences on the physical conditions in the reactors, especially in terms of heat and mass transfer at the reactor wall on the one hand and at the catalytic surface on the other hand. Moreover, instabilities may appear. D. Vanhove /Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 215-234 217 Such phenomena cannot be detected in laboratory micro-reactors at low conversion. Therefore, the aim of this work is to evaluate their effects on the working conditions at the catalytic surface level. The contribution of the geometric characteristics of the reactor on these effects and their consequences on the screening of catalysts based on such tests will also be discussed. First, a comparison between industrial catalytic oxidations and a new emerg- ing process is made, on a literature basis, to clarify the evolution on this matter. Furthermore, simulations -- based on the patent data -- of catalytic tests in micro-reactors, for the oxidation of isobutane to produce methacrylic acid, were conducted. They make it possible to draw conclusions, irrespective of the kinetics of the reaction, on the possible conditions existing inside the reactor and on the catalyst surface. The influence of some critical factors has also been evaluated in relation with transfer phenomena. 2. Comparison of reactor operation for some catalytic oxidations One of the main industrial operations using gas-phase catalytic oxidation with air is currently phthalic anhydride synthesis from o-xylene. This reaction has been studied for a long time and still is extensively studied by numerous groups in all disciplines, with a remarkable constancy. Catalysts and solid surface studies, mechanistic approaches, kinetic modelling, reactor simulations and design, stability testing, etc. are some of the main axes of investigation. Some other oxidations are of great importance, because of the place of the product in petrochemistry and of the extent of their production, i.e. propene oxidation for making acrolein and acrylic acid, n-butane transformation -- which has progressively replaced benzene oxidation in maleic anhydride -- isobutene to methacrolein reaction. These reactions are also the subject of intensive research work aimed at increasing selectivity via new catalysts that permit a lower temperature and better control. All these processes, except n-butane oxidation, involve unsaturated and/or functionalised reagents, i.e., aromatics, olefins, aldehydes. Due to the easy adsorption and activation of the /3 C-H bond in these compounds, catalysts of low acidity exhibit a high activity at moderate temperatures, avoiding the degradation of valuable products (aldehydes and acids). Thus, industrial reactors operate at low residence times (1 s or less), middle temperatures (320-350) and very low hydrocarbon partial pressures (1%-2%0) and achieve a quasi-total conversion. In these reactors, the hot spot extent is controlled by a high turbulence that ensures high transfer rates. At these moderate temperatures, the catalyst activity for products degradation is low and very high selectivities (up to 90%-95%) are obtained [9-13]. This fact also contributes to moderate the thermal effect of the reaction. Moreover, in the case of unsaturated anhydrides production (maleic, phthalic), the great stability of the cycle plays a major role 218 D. Vanhove /Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 215-234 Table 1 Reaction conditions for some industrial or prospective industrial catalytic oxidations o-Xylene n-Butane Isobutane Catalyst V-Ti-O V-P-O HPA Contact time (s NTP) 1.1 1.5 3.6 Partial pressure (bar) 0.0085 0.018 0.26 Conversion 1 0.89 0.12 Molar yield 0.75 0.587 0.061 Selectivity 0.75 0.66 0.51 Production rate (product mol/s/m3) 0.23 0.42 0.2 Enthalpy of reaction (kcal/mol HC transf.) - 404 - 320 - 329 for low degradation. In the case of propene oxidation, the low reaction tempera- ture restricts the combustion of acrolein. Low residence time and partial pressure, weak acidity of the catalyst, low temperature and high selectivity as a whole, act for the improvement of these processes. In spite of the high productivity achieved, all these factors permit to control the thermal effect and the hot spot extent (Table 1). Currently, the goal is to produce the same petrochemicals with cheaper raw materials if possible coming directly from refining units, i.e., distillation cuts, especially low value light alkanes. In such respect, n-butane has practically replaced benzene and extensive efforts are carried out to use ethane to form ethylene or acetic acid, propane to form propene, acrolein or acrylic acid, isobutane to form isobutene, methacrolein and methacrylic acid, and so on. The activation of saturated hydrocarbons by oxygen requires high tempera- tures on classical mixed oxide catalysts. Under these conditions, the valuable products, i.e., olefins, unsaturated aldehydes and acids, are extensively degraded when residence time and conversion are forced [1-5]. Highest yields are then generally obtained at a conversion lower than 20%. This does not apply to n-butane because of its easier activation and of the stability of maleic anhydride. Heteropolyanions activate alkanes [6-8] at lower temperature than mixed oxides but the temperature has to be restricted to avoid the degradation of the catalyst structure, leading to rapid deactivation above 350. The choice of low reaction temperatures brings about a rather low reaction rate when hydrocarbon partial pressure is identical to those adopted in industrial applications, mentioned before. The partial pressures are, thus, typically forced in patents well over the explosion limit and beyond to ensure sufficient productivity. Moreover, the acidic properties of such catalysts are detrimental to the products even at middle temperatures. Molar fractions as high as 0.2 to 0.5 are also reported for the oxidative dimerization of methane, the oxidehydrogenation of ethane, propane or isobu- D. Vanhove /Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 215-234 219 tyric acid, and for the oxidation of ethane, propane or isobutane to produce acids. An example, provided by the patent literature, is the catalytic oxidation of isobutane on HPA catalysts [6-8]. The transformation of a iso-C4:O2:N2:H20 (26:13:49:12) feed is carried out at a low temperature, 320, with a 3.6 s contact time [6]. Conversions remain fairly low: 10%-12% with almost 50% selectivity for methacrylic acid formation (Table 1). Considering, respectively, o-xylene, n-butane and isobutane oxidations, data from Table 1 show that the reported operating conditions (contact time and partial pressure of hydrocarbon) increase when the obtained conversion drops. So, partial pressure is increased by up to 30 times in order to keep comparable and economical productivity in all three cases. Further analysis of these values points out some difficulties when catalyst testing or reaction studies must be carried out in a microscale reactor. In the case of fast reactions, such as the first two examples, the contact time can be greatly reduced at the laboratory scale by using a low catalyst weight and a high gas velocity. The conversion and the heat production rate per exchange surface unit (specific power) are consequently lower than in the case of an industrial reactor while hydrodynamics and thermal exchange will be similar. Under these conditions, the reactor works in differential pseudo-isothermal conditions without any considerable gradient. In the case of isobutane oxidation and other slow alkane oxidations, catalyst testing in micro-reactors is hampered by several problems due to very different conditions. (1) The high partial pressures used and the productivity described in the patents [6] lead to heat production per reactor volume unit as high as that observed in the integral industrial reactors for maleic and phthalic anhydrides production, working at total conversion (see Table 2). (2) The low reaction rate and conversion do not permit to reduce significantly the contact time and the heat production in laboratory reactors because of analytical problems. A high contact time in a low volume reactor can only be achieved at very low gas velocity (less than 1 cm/s) leading to laminar flow and, thus, bad heat and mass transfers. The comparison between some engineering characteristics of these reactions, reported in Table 2, shows that a micro-reactor, whose height-to-diameter ratio is low, must evacuate a specific power as high as 2 kW/m2 when testing isobutane oxidation as in Ref. [6]. At the same time, the particle Reynolds number is two hundred times smaller than in the oxidation of o-xylene and n-butane, revealing poor hydrodynamics. Moreover, on account of the high partial pressure, adiabatic temperature rise reaches a very high value. While high turbulence achieved in industrial reactors ensures high transfer coefficients and allows for a limitation of the hot spot extent (70 K), experi- ments at high partial pressures and low Rep in thin reactors are potentially 220 Table 2 Reactor parameters D.

Thus, there could be instability. These hypotheses may be evaluated from two approaches: stability criteria or simulation. 3. Stability criteria applied to alkane oxidation in micro-reactors Although laboratory reactors may appear to operate in a reaction-controlled regime and to be without gradient (low conversions, low flow rates and low measured temperature rise, constant reaction rates at various contact times) the true catalytic conditions may considerably differ from the assumed ones. For highly exothermic reactions, this may have drastic consequences on stability. Numerous authors have proposed criteria to determine conditions leading to reactor runaway [14-20]. In these works, the objective was related to the industrial reactor control and to post-combustion operations, but instability and light-off of micro-reactors may occur even in the case of mild oxidation reactions. Most of them use the same parameters: N/S or 1/A, ratio of heat production rate (and heat transfer rate) at the hot spot to heat production rate at the inlet of reactor and S =/33,, the product of non-dimensional adiabatic temperature rise and of non-dimensional activation energy. Barkelew [14] has determined a boundary, in a N/S vs. S graphical representation, between a stable domain and a region leading to runaway. Many D.

[20] 0.373 0.494 12.34 authors have proposed other criteria for various conditions and have found that the position of this limit depends essentially on kinetic order [15-19]. Neverthe- less, the variations in this position are low. More recently, Balakotaiah and Luss [20] have extended the procedure and have proposed a mathematical criterion including the effects of extraparticle and intraparticle resistances. The parameters used by Barkelew [14] and by Balakotaiah and Luss [20] were calculated for the three reactions -- presented above -- under the conditions previously described and reported in Table 3. In each case, the wall heat transfer coefficient was estimated from the Leva correlation [21], the fluid-to-particle heat transfer coefficient -- used in the Balakotaiah's criterion -- from the Chilton and Colbum relation [23] and, the kinetics being unknown, the mean rate in the whole reactor was taken as the rate at the entrance. Consequently, the values of N/S (and 1/A) are underestimated. The intraparticle resistances have not been taken into account, the pore characteristics of industrial catalysts for catalytic oxidations being generally adjusted to avoid such influences. The values of Barkelew's coordinates (N/S, S) are shown in Fig. 1. It is clear that there are drastic changes going from the conditions for industrial oxidation of o-xylene to those for n-butane industrial reaction and then to those for isobutane oxidation in a microreactor. The first two examples are in the stable domain or near its limit while the other appears to be well within the unstable region. Similar behaviour should be observed with the other alkane transformations that operate at high partial pressures. In the same figure, the Balakotaiah's criterion, applied to the case of free-diffusion conditions, is drawn. In this case, the N/S and 1/A parameters have identical values and instability can occur at N/S < 2.72 (A > 0.368). Including external heat transfer resistance, the values of A decrease as shown in Table 3 and the isobutane oxidation reactor appears far over this limit of instability ( A -- 0.368). The implementation of the procedure of Van Welsenaere and Froment [16] to such cases leads to the same conclusion in a different way. The basis of the 222 D.

Comparison in terms of stability for o-xylene and n-butane industrial reactors and isobutane micro-reactor operating at high partial pressure assuming free-diffusion case: (1) after Barkelew [14], (2) after Balakotaiah and Luss [20]. method is, starting from activation energy, to calculate the maximal temperature difference at hot spot to avoid reactor runaway. Then the maximum admissible partial pressure is deduced from the reaction rate, assuming a first order dependence for alkane. In the case of isobutane oxidation on HPA, the kinetic parameters are not known. The reaction rate constant can only be evaluated from a mean reaction rate in the whole catalyst bed and the activation energy postulated by analogy with similar reactions. Acting as described and using the values reported in Table 3, the calculated maximum temperature difference and partial pressure for stable operation change from 48 K and 0.031 bar to 34 K and 0.02 bar when activation energy varies from 17 to 23 kcal/mol. These results show that very high thermal effects can occur and that runaway situations are potential when partial pressures greater than a few per cent isobutane in the feed are used in reactor of small length and at high contact times. This can also be illustrated by the calculation of the wall heat transfer coefficient that will be needed to insure stability when isobutane partial pressure is taken as equal to 0.26 bar. The value obtained, 44 W m-2 K-t, corresponds, using the Leva correlation, to Rep = 50, which must be compared to the 5 W m-2 K-l value corresponding to the conditions described (Rep = 2.3). It may be noted, in addition, that these evaluations are in all cases far lower than in the simulation of a tubular reactor operation by integration of accurate kinetic equation (not known at this time) and energy balance. D. Vanhove / Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 215-234 223 In conclusion, even if thermal effects are not detected in catalytic beds of small length, the catalyst may be working under unstable conditions with potential consequences on catalyst performances and structural evolution of the catalyst. 4. Simulation of micro-reactor for catalytic oxidation of isobutane The overall conclusions, made above, must be completed by reactor simula- tion, particularly to evaluate the extent of heat and mass extraparticle resis- tances. Moreover, the effect of some design parameters could be shown in such a way as to search the means to reduce these effects as much as possible. Nevertheless, the simulation of runs with new catalysts for new reactions raises numerous problems. First, the kinetic equation and parameters are un- known and simulation stands on a unique datum, conversion at given contact time. In particular, the evolution of reaction rate versus temperature must be estimated. Second, the hydrodynamics of the catalytic bed, whose thickness does not exceed 7 particle diameters, is not ideal and can hardly be modeled. The last problem -- and not the least -- consists in the precise evaluation of the three transfer coefficients: gas-wall and particle-gas heat transfer coefficients, and also particle-gas mass transfer coefficient. Numerous correlations have ap- peared in the literature for the turbulent domain (Rep > 50); their application to conditions far from the validity range leads to discrepancies greater than one order of magnitude. Thus, the aim of this study is to detect large effects and evaluate tendencies rather than to predict temperature and concentration profiles. The kinetic model used is first order for isobutane and zero order for oxygen, but, nevertheless, the low conversion makes this assumption not critical for the results. The activation energy was chosen equal to 17 kcal/mol, which appears consistent with this type of reaction. The effect of variation of activation energy on profiles was tested and is shown below. A one-dimensional heterogeneous model was applied with the plug flow assumption. The wall heat transfer coefficient was deduced from the Leva correlation [21], as previously reported. Particle-gas coefficients stem from the application of Yoshida et al. [22] and Chilton and Colburn [23] correlations. The set of equations used will be given in the appendix. Thus, the simulation was made by integration of the model equation, the kinetic constant being adjusted so as to obtain the desired conversion at the outlet of the reactor. For the reasons given before, the conclusions drawn from these simulations must be carefully interpreted and have only a comparative meaning. Neverthe- less, they are only based on external measurable parameters, such as flow rates, inlet and outlet concentrations, geometric characteristics of catalyst and reactor. 224 D.

Heat and mass transfer estimated from correlations [21-23] (see text). Postulated activation energy: 17 kcal/mol. In this respect, they can be applied on the same bases to the other cases and then have a wide application. Fig. 2 shows calculated profiles for superficial temperature, bulk temperature and conversion in a reactor operating at the conditions given in [6]. The required conversion can only be obtained for a rate constant value (km = 4.024- 10-3 s-l) leading to an exponential acceleration and runaway occurring at the end of the catalytic bed. Moreover, a high thermal gradient of about 15 K is observed between the particles and the fluid. In contrast, mass transfer does not affect kinetics in so far as runaway has not started. The chemical rate represents less than 1% of the diffusion rate (Fig. 3). The value of the activation energy is not known but can be evaluated in the 17-20 kcal/mol range. The study on the influence of this parameter on instability was made taking various values for Ea and keeping the outlet conversion constant by adjustment of the kinetic rate constant. When the activation energy is increased, the sensitivity of the reactor for runaway in- creases, as shown on the temperature profiles by the position of the inflexion point and the slope at this point (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, general conclusions on temperature differences and on the occurrence of runaway are maintained. In the same approach, the heat transfer coefficients, issued from extrapolation of correlations out of their Re validity domain, might be underestimated. D.

Moreover, the axial effective conductivity and the axial dispersion effects are not taken into account in spite of their influence on heat transfer in micro-reac- tors. These uncertainties could question conclusions on stability. Thus, a 4-fold arbitrary increase of wall (U = 20 W m-2 K- l ) and fluid-particle (h = 52 W m-2 K-l) heat transfer coefficients was tested. The behaviour is similar to that previously observed (Fig. 5) with quite few pronounced effects. At the imposed conversion and contact time, obtained by a 3-fold increase in the catalytic activity (kinetic rate constant increases from 0.00402 to 0.01243 s-~), runaway cannot be avoided and a 10 K fluid-particle temperature difference is kept. When the wall heat transfer coefficient is increased, regardless of the fluid-particle coefficient, the fluid-particle temperature difference increases sharply and is at the origin of the exponential increase of reaction rate and temperatures. Whatever the kinetics, all simulations show that catalyst testing in micro-reac- tors cannot be achieved at a high production rate without high thermal gradients and probably partial runaway. Two intrinsic reasons explain this behaviour: on the one hand, a poor hydrodynamics is achieved under those conditions leading to low heat transfer coefficients and, on the other hand, a very high adiabatic temperature rise due to high hydrocarbon partial pressure giving a high fluid- particle temperature difference, even if mass transfer limitations are negligible. Accentuated temperature profiles and fluid-particle gradients initiate an expo- nential increase of reaction rate and consequently reactor runaway. Some of D. Vanhove / Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 215-234 227 these phenomena cannot be directly detected due to the reduced size of the reactor and to the poor validity of local temperature measurements. With apparent pseudo-isothermal, quasi-differential conditions, the observed catalytic properties could then be very different from the intrinsic ones corre- sponding to the measured operational parameters. 5. Effects of operating variables on stability and isothermal operation of catalytic micro-reactors Thermal effects, both in the reactor and at the catalytic surface, can have drastic consequences on selectivity and on catalyst structure. This is particularly the case in the catalytic oxidation of alkanes, due to the predominant adsorption of the products, unsaturated aldehydes and acids, and to their high reactivity. Thus, selectivity drops when temperature increases. In the same way, superficial firing of the catalyst (specially in the case of heteropolyanions) generally causes a detrimental decrease in activity and/or selectivity. For catalytic screening, low temperature rises could be tolerated in so far as they do not alter the main global properties of the catalyst; in contrast, perfect temperature and concentration control are essential when kinetic studies and mechanistic approaches are undertaken. Thus, the search for experimental conditions responding to these objectives was carried out by simulating changes in reactor geometry. Two operating variables, reactor diameter and catalytic volume, have then been varied, keeping the contact time constant. In this section, the kinetic parameters are kept at the values obtained in the latter application: k = 0.01243 s-t and Ea = 17 kcal/mol. 5.1. Effect of reactor diameter The decrease in reactor diameter at the same catalytic volume and contact time leads to an increase in gas velocity, reactor length and, thus, surface exchange area. The consequences of dividing into two the reactor diameter are a 2-fold increase in fluid-particle heat and mass transfer coefficients, a less pronounced effect on wall heat transfer coefficient increasing from 20 to 24 W m-2 K-1 when the volumic heat production rate is divided by a factor two. Temperature and conversion profiles calculated assuming a 8 mm internal reactor diameter and at the same external temperature (593 K) are shown in Fig. 6. In this case, runaway has disappeared and thermal gradients are greatly reduced. Meanwhile a considerably reduced conversion (2.6%) is obtained, due to the important drop in mean superficial temperature. To ensure the desired conversion (12%) and productivity in the same reactor, the external temperature can be increased. When a value as high as 635.6 K is 228 D.

The reactor diameter appears to be a tool to improve reactor thermal control. However, the extent of the effects is limited because of the decrease in wall heat transfer coefficient that occurs at small diameters and because of the practical limits due to the particle dimension. 5.2. Effect of the volume of the catalytic bed Increasing the volume of a catalytic bed, while keeping the contact time constant, leads to raised flow rates and, for a fixed productivity, to the same heat production rate per volume unit. The effects produced are limited to an increase in Reynolds number and consequently in transfer coefficients. They are notice- able for important multiplying factors. Nevertheless, contrary to reactor diame- ter, this can easily be achieved. The simulation of a reactor containing 96 ml of catalyst in place of 6 is shown on Fig. 9 which should be compared to Fig. 5, all other conditions being similar. If the external temperature is maintained at 593 K, thermal profiles are fiat and low temperature differences are obtained. However, the conversion achieved is low, 2.2%. By increasing the extemal temperature up to 669.5 K, the desired production rate can be obtained while perfect reactor stability is assured and the temperature differences are low and nearly constant along the reactor (Fig. 10). 230 D.

Thus, the problem of the determination of the true parameters remains. Enlarged catalytic reactors then appear to be the best tool to ensure relative isothermal operation when working at high partial pressures. Gas velocity is the main parameter that must be carefully mastered to avoid instability, runaway and thermal gradients. Significant effects on selectivity were and will be insured this way [24]. 6. Conclusion This contribution does not pretend to describe the precise conditions existing in a micro-reactor used in catalytic oxidations of alkanes; the values of the physical parameters that enable such calculations are unknown at this time or cannot be precisely evaluated, due to the unusual operating conditions in this case. The main objective is to prove, starting from a minimum of information on reactivity, that catalyst testing and screening in micro-reactors at high contact time and high partial pressure, under the conditions reported in the literature for slow rate alkane transformations, may lead to serious thermal problems. Conditions near reactor runaway can occur and the true catalyst temperature can be far from the measured ones. These effects cannot be easily detected by 232 D. Vanhove /Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 215-234 conventional techniques. Moreover, the low conversions lead us to assume a differential operation which, in our mind, is related to pseudo-isothermal operation. In fact, the value of the adiabatic temperature rise contradicts such assumptions. The effects, shown here, have important consequences in catalytic screening: many of the catalysts tested, if active, may appear of low selectivity, not because of their intrinsic properties but only because of the high temperature rises they cause in relation with high reaction rate. Good potential catalysts (active and selective) could, thus, be wrongly eliminated on the basis of suspicious testing conditions. The main problem lies in fluid-particle thermal gradients which are the source of instability. The reduction of this effect needs to ensure sufficient transfer coefficients that can only be achieved by assuring high gas velocity. Catalytic volume increase is, thus, a simple and efficient tool to carry out such conditions and to obtain safer and more significant results at high produc- tion rate but kinetic analysis remains problematic.

(+33) 20335438, fax. (+33) 20335499 Recent trends in catalysis have emerged using new processes and new raw materials in order to reduce the number of steps leading from petroleum distillates to chemical intermediates. Selective activation of the strong CH bonds present in alkanes by catalytic action of oxygen is a stimulating challenge and new efficient catalysts have appeared in some cases. Nevertheless, the selective materials exhibit very low activities and low selectivities at high hydrocarbon conversion. Extreme conditions (partial pressures, residence time) are, thus, chosen to improve the production rate, which can have dramatic consequences on the real working conditions of the catalytic surface, when laboratory tests are performed. Catalytic oxidation of isobutane forming methacrylic acid was chosen as an example and compared to oldest and ‘classical’ mild oxidations. It is shown that in micro-reactors, in apparent isothermal and differential operation, extreme thermal gradients between the catalyst surface and fluid can develop. Moreover, whatever the kinetics and thermal exchange, the search for productivity announced in patents causes runaway in all cases without external evidence. These effects could lead to an erroneous interpretation of results in terms of kinetics and mechanisms, to drastic decreases in selectivities and therefore to the rejection of the most active catalysts due to a low apparent selectivity which could be a consequence of poor testing conditions. Simulation of different reactor geometry shows that industrial-like pilot plants could be more stable and more selective than micro-reactors. The increase of catalytic bed volume appears as a major positive factor in this objective. The screening of catalysts for these new reactions must thus be carried out with extreme care in the choice of experimental parameters.
