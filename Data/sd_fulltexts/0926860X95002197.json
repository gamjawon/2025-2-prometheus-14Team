When NiO loading increased to 17.5 wt.-%, the syngas production over NiO/T-A1203 is found to increase consistently. In that case, the addition of La203 can improve the catalytic activity significantly, with a NiO content of more than 17.5 wt.-%, a very small extent of change in the catalytic activity and the selectivity for the methane oxidation to syngas as well as a little effect of La203 on the activity and the selectivity are observed. Under the condition of high space velocity, the CO2 and H20 reforming of CH4 occurs to a very small extent over reduced 12.5 wt.-% NiO/0.5 wt.-% La203/~/-A1203 catalyst. This fact and the results of the effect of space velocity on the methane partial oxidation to syngas suggest that both H2, CO and CO2, H20 are the primary products of the methane oxidation. The results of characterizing 12.5 wt.- % NiO/0.5 wt.-% La203/3'-A1203 catalyst reveal that the active form of catalyst is metallic Ni and the promoter La203 facilitate the reduction of the oxidative nickel. Keywords: Methane; Partial oxidation; Syngas 1. Introduction Much recent research [ 1-5 ] has been made for converting methane to products that are more valuable and more easily transported. Such products include higher hydrocarbons and the partial oxidation products which are formed by either the direct routes such as oxidation coupling reactions or the indirect methods via synthesis gas as an intermediate. Among the most important commercial methods of synthesis gas manufacturing is the steam reforming of methane: * Co~esponding author. Fax.

Chu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 67-80 CH4 + H20 ~ CO + 3H2 ( 1 ) with AH= + 49.2 kcal/mol. This process, utilizing an Ni/AlzO3 catalyst promoted with CaO and/or K20, necessitates large amount of energy and also suffers from limitations like poor selectivity for CO and high H2/CO product ratio which is unsuitable for methanol and the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Because of the energy crisis and the consider- able expenses needed for maintaining the steam reforming reaction, it is of great practical importance to develop new routes for the synthetic gas production from methane. Another approach for syngas production is the direct oxidation of cn4: CH4+ 2 ~ CO+2H2 (2) with AH= - 8.5 kcal/mol. This process is mildly exothermic and free from the limitations of the steam reforming process. It is suggested that the route for the syngas generation from partial oxidation of CH4 would be a viable alternative to steam reforming. Recently, Green and co-workers [4,5 ] studied the partial oxidation of CH4 over mixed metal oxides of ruthenium and over a range of supported transition metals. They reported that CH4/O2 feed ratios >~ 1.7 could be converted in a very high yield ( > 90%) to H2/CO product at reaction temperature >I 750. In the reaction both CH4 conversion and CO/CO2 product ratio are in agreement with the ther- modynamic equilibrium prediction. The authors postulated that the reaction path- way, in all cases, may involve the initial conversion of a fraction of the CH4 feed to CO2 and HzO, followed by the occurrence of H20 and CO2 reforming and water- gas shift reactions. Dissanayake and co-workers [ 3 ] studied the partial oxidation of CH4 over a 25 wt.-% Ni/AI203 catalyst and the chemical composition of the catalyst under reac- tion conditions. Their results revealed that CO selectivity approaches 95% and virtually complete conversion of the methane feed can be achieved under the condition of reaction temperature >~750, space velocity = 750 vol/vol/h and CH4/O2 of feed = 1.78. Under operating conditions, the catalyst bed consists of three different regions. The first of these is NiA1204 which has only moderate activity for complete oxidation of methane to CO2 and H20; The second region is NiO + AI203, over which complete oxidation of CH4 to CO2 occurs and the 02 feed is consumed completely. The third portion of the catalyst bed is a reduced Ni/ A1203 phase in which H2 and CO products are produced. Hickman and Schmidt [6] examined the effects of the catalyst geometries, the reaction temperature and the rates of mass transfer during the methane partial oxidation over Pt Monoliths catalysts. They concluded that H2 and CO are primary products. The selectivity of products is improved by operating at higher gas and catalyst temperatures, by maintaining high rates of mass transfer through the bound- ary layer at the catalyst surface and by using catalysts with high metal loadings. Y. Chu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 67--80 \" 69 In this paper, we summarize the results of the catalytic behavior of NiO/T-AIzOs and NiO/Laz03/T-A1203 catalysts for the conversion of CH4/Oz feeds to syngas. Particular emphasis was placed on characterizing the reaction activity, chemical composition and reduction property of a 12.5 wt.-% NiO/0.5 wt.-% La203/'y- AI203 catalyst. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials The catalysts employed in this study were prepared by impregnation techniques. The appropriate amount of Ni (NO3) 2 or La (NO3) 3 was dissolved in 1 ml deionized water, 1 g T-AI203 (166m2/g, 20-40 mesh) was impregnated by that solution. Having been stirred for 10 min, the catalytic precursors, Ni(NO3)2/T-AI203 or La(NO3)3/T-AI203, were dried at 110 for 10 h. The samples thus formed were calcined at 750 for 4 h to yield NiO/'y-A1203 or La203/T-AI203 catalysts. NiO/ La203/T-A1203 catalysts were prepared by step impregnating T-A1203 in the sequence 0 f La (NO3) 3 to Ni ( NO3) 2 to form the catalytic precursors, La (NO3) 3- Ni(NO3)2/AI2Os, drying at 110 for 10h and calcining in air at 750 for 4h. The amounts of NiO and/or La203 are expressed as wt.-%. High purity gases [cn4 (99.99%), 02 (99.9%), N2 (99.99%), CO2 (99.9%) and H2 (99.99%) ] were used. Their ratios are expressed as molar ratios. 2.2. Procedures The catalytic reaction experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure using a micro-fixed-bed reactor made of quartz (Fig. 1 ), which was heated by a tubular furnace. The reaction temperature was controlled by a chromel-alumel thermocou- pie. A 50 mg catalyst sample was used in all runs, except when very high space velocity was required for which a 20 mg sample was employed. Before the reaction was carried out, the catalyst was pretreated in a 1:1 mixture of either O2:N2 or H2:N2 for 30 min at 750, with a total flow rate of 80 ml/min. The water formed in the reaction was condensed from the effluent at 0. The reactant and product mixtures were analyzed by a gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detec- tor, using a carbonsieve column. The conventional temperature programmed reduction (TPR) technique has been applied to characterize the reduction behavior of the catalysts. The weight of the sample employed is 100 mg in all runs. The spectra of the TPR was obtained according to the following procedure. First, the sample was pretreated in the flow of N2 at 750 for 1 h until no desorption products from the sample were observed and then cooled down to room temperature. Second, the carrier gas was changed to be a 1:9 mixture of H2:N2 using a total flow rate of 20 ml/min. After the sample 70 E Chu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 67-80 Gas Flow r (I) 8 ........ __~: ~ -- Catalyst Bed 1 -~ \"~-- - Thcrmocouple Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the reactor. was heated to 830 with the heating rate being 15/min, the spectra recording the reduction behavior of the sample were obtained. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were performed on a PHI-550 ESCA/AES Spectrometer using Mg Ka radiation ( 1253.6 eV, 320 W) with 50 eV of CMA pass energy. The C 1 s peak of the contaminated carbon at 284.6 eV and the AI 2p peak of the alumina support of catalyst at 74.7 eV were used as internal standards. The sample probe was contained in a glove box with nitrogen atmosphere to prevent the previously treated samples from contacting atmospheric 02 and H20. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data were obtained on a D-MAX-RB diffrac- tion spectrometer, using Cu Ka radiation generated at 50 KV and 100 mA. Data were collected by step scan methods with a 20 region of 15-70which encompassed the major peaks of the compounds being investigated. 3. Results 3.1. Catalytic activity of NiO/y-Al203 catalysts The catalytic reaction behaviors for CH4 oxidation over support T-AI203 and La203/A1203, NiO/AI203 catalysts are compared in Table 1. The support T-AI203 and La203/AI203 catalyst had poor activities and selectivities for the cn4 partial oxidation reaction. When the amount of NiO in NiO/AI203 catalysts was less than 17.5%, the increase of the NiO amount improved the activity and the selectivity for methane to syngas. As the catalyst was loaded with 17.5% NiO, its catalytic behavior for methane partial oxidation to syngas reached the summit. Improving the amount of NiO from 17.5% resulted in a very small extent of change in catalytic Y.

After the reactions, the catalysts with the loading of NiO ~< 12.5% remained the original light blue color.

Chu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 67-80 of La203 in the catalysts of 10.0% NiO/La203/AI203 resulted in the evident improvement on the CH4 conversion and the selectivity to syngas. As for NiO/ La2Oa/AI203 catalysts whose loading of NiO were 12.5% or 15%, the adding of La203 enormously enhanced the catalytic activity and selectivity for methane to syngas, but the amounts of La203 caused little effect on catalytic behavior of the catalysts. The catalytic behavior of 17.5% NiO/La203/AI203 catalysts for partial oxidation of cn4, which was not affected by the amount of La203 in the catalysts, was the same as that for the 17.5% NiO/AI203 catalyst. 3.2. Effect of the temperature and the space velocity on the reaction behavior of 12.5% Ni0/0.5% La2OJAl203 catalyst The effect of a cycle of sequential changes in reaction temperature on the con- versions of CH4 and 02 and on the reaction selectivity to CO and H2 is described for a typical experiment with a 12.5% NIO/0,5% La203 catalyst sample in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. At the initial reaction temperature of 500, the conversion of CH4 and 02 was only 1.3% and 3.8% and most of the products were CO2 and H20. Raising the temperature, the conversion of cn4 and the selectivity to syngas increased gradually. At 700, the conversion of CH4 is 25.5% and approximate 50% of the converted CH4 feed was changed into CO and H2. When the reaction temperature increased to 720, the catalyst suddenly emitted red light. This phenomenon disappeared with a further increase of the temperature to 750 and reaction for 10 min at 750. Meanwhile, most of the catalyst bed below 720, which remained light blue, became black, with only the upper portion of the catalyst (less than 10%) remaining blue. Conversion of CH4 increased to virtually 92% and the feeding oxygen was completely depleted, the products were CO and H2 (1:2) mixed with //.-'\" g g 4o r,.) 20 ~'- I I I 500 600 700 800 900 Temperature(*C ) Fig. 2.

Further increase of the reaction temperature from 750 caused little change in either activity or selectivity. When the reaction temperature of the original 2:1 mixture of CH4:O2 was sub- sequently decreased from 900 to 500, the conversion of both CH4 and 02 and the selectivities to both CO and H2 did not retrace the pathways observed at the stage of the initial temperature increase. Conversion of 02 remained 100%, while the CI-I4 conversion decreased gradually with the reaction temperature decreasing, but remained i> 60%. Selectivities to CO and H2 also decreased gradually as the reaction temperature went down. The above phenomenon is similar to that seen with the 25% NiO/a-A1203 catalyst observed by Dissanayake et al. [3]. The effect of changes of space velocity on reaction behavior is depicted in Fig. 4. Increasing the space velocity slightly decreased the activity and the selectivity. It is indicated that both CO, H2 and CO2, H20 are primary products probably. 3.3. The other reactions over the reduced 12.5% Ni0/0.5% Za2OJAl203 catalyst Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5 show the respective results of the reaction of CO2+CH4, H2+CO2 and CHa+HEO over reduced 12.5% NIO/0.5% La203/ AI203 catalyst. Under the condition of a high temperature (750) and low space velocity (3.6.104 ml/g h), the CO2 reforming reaction with methane occurred to a considerable extent. Decrease of the reaction temperature and the increase of the space velocity of CH4:CO2 feed resulted in a great decrease of the reaction activity (Table 3). When the space velocity was increased to 1.44.105 ml/g h, the CH4+CO2 reaction occurred to a small extent. Under the condition of 1.44.105 ml/g h of space velocity, the methane conversion and the selectivity for CO in the 74 Y.

Catalyst characterization The XRD spectra of fresh samples and used catalysts following partial oxidation of CH4 at 750 are presented in Fig. 5. Maybe, the loading of La203 was too low, both the 12.5% NIO/0.5% La203/T-AI203 catalyst and the 0.5% La203/T-AI203 sample did not show any patterns of LaaO3 in XRD and XPS.

This fact was proved by the XPS spectra of the two samples(Fig. 5 and Fig. 6a-b). After the reaction ofCH4 + 02 at 750, the catalyst bed had two regions a lower black one and an upper light blue. The results of the XRD patterns show that the identifiable phases in black sample were y-A1203 and metallic Ni and in the blues were T-A1203, metallic Ni and traces of NiAI204. The results of the XPS measure- ments for the two samples were shown in Fig. 6c and Fig. 6d. The nickel species with a 2p3/2 peak at a binding energy of ca. 856 eV and an accompanying shake- up satellite peak at ca. 862 eV was characterized to be NiAl204 [7,8]. The spectra with a Ni 2p3/2 peak at a binding energy of ca. 852 eV and the absence of a significant satellite peak were assigned to be that of metallic Ni [ 8,9]. The XPS spectra observed for the black were consistent with the XRD patterns. However, the only response of NiAl204 was observed in the XPS spectra for the blue sample. So, for the black portion of the catalyst used at 750, the state of Ni was in the form of metallic Ni either in the bulk or on the surface and for the blue portion, the phase of Ni was in the form of NiA1204 on the surface and primarily in the form of metallic Ni with only a trace of NiAl204 being detected in the bulk. The TPR results of the catalyst and the other corresponding samples are depicted in Fig. 7. The fact that the H2-TPR spectra of the support T-AI203 were very similar to that of 0.5% La203/A1203 indicated that the La203 supported by T-AI203 was not reduced under 830, so we supposed that the reduction peak of the catalyst was only due to the reduction of the oxidative nickel in the catalyst. The TPR spectra of the ]2.5% NiO/A]203 showed that the only reduction peak began to appear at about 700 and did not reach the summit until 830. The H2-TPR of Y.

The loading of La203 obviously decreased the reduction temperature of NiA1204. The XPS results in conjunction with the H2-TPR to 750 are displayed in Fig. 8. Following the H2-TPR to 750, the nickel phase in 12.5% NIO/0.5% La203/AI203 catalyst was characterized to be a mixture of metallic Ni and NiO, assigned by a Ni 2p3/2 peak at a binding energy of ca. 855 eV and a Ni 2pl/2 peak at a binding energy of ca. 873 eV [9-11 ].

Discussion 4.1. The active form of the NiO/y-Al203 and the NiO/La2OJy-Al203 catalyst in reaction The catalytic behaviors of NiO/y-AI203 and NiO/La203/y-AI203 in the partial oxidation of CH4 is very similar to that of NiO/a-A1203 catalyst observed by Dissanayake et al. [3]. The active form of NiO/a-AI203 in methane partial oxi- dation is metallic Ni supported on a-A1203. This fact indicates that the active form of NiO/T-AI203 and NiO/La203 /T-AI203 is the metallic Ni supported on \"y-A1203, proved by the XRD and the XPS data. NiAI204 in the precalcined catalyst of NiO/ La203/'y-AI203, which shows poor activity and selectivity for partial oxidation of CH4, decomposes at ca. 720 in a 2:1 mixture of CH4:O2 and changes into metallic nickel, causing a remarkable increase in the conversions of CH4 and 02 and in the selectivities to CO and H2. The effect of high exothermity in this course results in the catalyst emitting red light that reveals the surface temperature of the catalyst possibly exceeds 750. As the phase transformation is over, the surface temper- ature of catalyst decreases and the red light diminish, while, the nickel of the upper most catalysts is reoxidized to NiAI204 and the reaction system attains a steady state condition. The NiO/'y-AI203 catalysts with the content ofNiO ~< 15% showing poor activity and selectivity for CH4 partial oxidation is due to the unreduction or small extent of reduction of the oxidative nickel (NiA1204) to metallic nickel under the condition of the reaction. With the high loading of NiO, the nickel at the surface of A1203 has two type of states, NiO and NiAI204 [ 12]. NiO is easier reduced to metallic Ni than NiAI204 [ 12,13 ]. So the NiO/A1203 catalysts with NiO content I> 17.5 % can produce the metallic Ni under the condition of reaction at 750 and show excellent activity and selectivity to syngas. 4.2. The effect of the promoter La203 For the NiO/La203/T-AI203 catalysts with the amount of NiO>_, 12.5%, the amount of La203 >~ 0.5% did not affect the catalytic behavior. This suggests that 12.5% NIO/0.5% La203/y-A1203 catalyst has already had enough active form to maintain the methane partial oxidation. The results of XRD and XPS patterns show that metallic Ni is the active form of catalyst and there is no difference between the metallic Ni in NiO/T-AI203 and that in NiO/La203/'y-AI203. In conjunction with the results of H2-TPR, it is revealed that La203 can have the NiAI204 on AI203 be reduced more easily. Due to the promoting reduction effect of La203, in NiO/ La203/AI203 catalysts with the loading of La203 >/0.5% and NiO >t 12.5%, enough active form of catalyst could have been produced to ensure the very high activity for CH4 partial oxidation. So the effect of the promoter La203 is promoting catalysts Y. Chu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 67-80 79 to produce its active form (metallic Ni supported on A1203) under the condition of reaction. 4.3. Reaction steps For the non-catalytic [ 14] and catalytic [3,4,15] methane oxidation to syngas conversion processes, operating at or close to the equilibrium, the authors postulated that the reaction path way involves the following series of steps: CH4 + 202 --~ C02 + 2H20 (3) CH4 + HEO ~ CO + 3H2 (4) CH4 + CO2 -~ 2CO + 2H2 (5) CO2+H2 \"-~ CO+HEO (6) In the present case, we find that the reaction path on NiO/LaEO3/AIEO3 catalyst is similar to this view under the condition of low space velocity but different from the above under the condition of very high space velocity. The results in Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5 indicate that the CO2 and HEO reforming of methane occur only to a small extent at high space velocity. This fact and good activity for methane to syngas at high space velocity suggest that syngas is formed directly from methane as primary products. Results of the effect of space velocity on the methane partial oxidation (Fig. 4) show that the activity for the methane oxidation to COE and HEO increased slightly with the increasing of space velocity of the CI-I4 + 02 feed. This phenomenon reveals that CO2 and HEO are also the primary products of the reaction. The primary products ratio of syngas to CO2 and HEO is probably determined by the surface structure of catalyst and the amounts of active oxygen species. Under the condition of low space velocity, the primary products, CO and HE, were probably oxidized to CO2 and HEO which were converted back to CO and H2 by the reforming reaction with methane. Based on the above discussions, the possible reactions occurring in the present process are: Under the condition of low space velocity [02] [02] CH4 --> CO+HE --* COE+H20 (7) 1021 CH4 \"-> CO2 + H20 (8) COE+H2 --> CO+HEO+CH4 (9) CH4 + CO2 \"-> CO + H2 (10) HEO+CH4 \"-~ CO+HE (11) Under the condition of high space velocity 80 Y. Chu et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 67-80 I02] CH4 ~ CO+H2 (12) [021 CH4 ~ CO2 -t- H20 (13) CO2 + H2 ~ CO + H20 (14) The exact mechanism of H2 and CO formation from methane oxidation still remains unclear and further investigation is necessary.

When NiO loading increased to 17.5 wt.-%, the syngas production over NiO γ-Al2O3 is found to increase consistently. In that case, the addition of La2O3 can improve the catalytic activity significantly, with a NiO content of more than 17.5 wt.-%, a very small extent of change in the catalytic activity and the selectivity for the methane oxidation to syngas as well as a little effect of La2O3 on the activity and the selectivity are observed. Under the condition of high space velocity, the CO2 and H2O reforming of CH4 occurs to a very small extent over reduced 12.5 wt.-% NiO/0.5 wt.-% La2O3 γ-Al2O3 catalyst. This fact and the results of the effect of space velocity on the methane partial oxidation to syngas suggest that both H2, CO and CO2, H2O are the primary products of the methane oxidation. The results of characterizing 12.5 wt.-% NiO/0.5 wt.-% La2O3 γ-Al2O3 catalyst reveal that the active form of catalyst is metallic Ni and the promoter La2O3 facilitate the reduction of the oxidative nickel.
