Nature of the active sites and their activation H. Berndt * , G. Lietz, J. Vter Institut fiir Angewandte Chemie, Berlin-Adlershof e.V., Rudower Chaussee 5, D-12484 Berlin, Germany Received 9 January 1996; revised 15 February 1996; accepted 19 February 1996 Abstract Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, prepared by ion exchange (Zne) and impregnation (Zn;) of a parent H-ZSM-5 as well as by physical mixing of ZnO with H-ZSM-5 (Znm) were characterized by TPR/H, TPSR/CO and TPDA. Their catalytic activity after thermal pretreatment in air or hydrogen was determined in the conversion of propane. Zinc species in Znj and Zne were hardly reducible. TPSR/CO revealed a generation of CO, and HZ explained as a reaction of [Zn(OH)]+ ions with CO. The corresponding TPSR/CO profiles indicated two peaks denominated as a- and peak and attributed to [Zn(OH]+ ions located in the channels (a-species) or on the external surface of the zeolite crystals (species). Residual ZnO, not reacting with CO was denominated as y-species, presenting ZnO outside the crystals. Znj and Znm samples could be activated by pretreatment in hydrogen. These samples also exhibited a self activation if they were mildly calcined before the testing. A correlation between the content of a-species and the activity has been demonstrated. TPSR/CO has proved to be a suitable new method for the determination of the active portion of zinc in Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

Berndt et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 365-379 prepared either by zinc ion exchange or impregnation with zinc salt solution. A relation was proposed between the activity and the amount of strongly acidic Lewis sites generated by ionic zinc species. Further investigation on the nature of these sites were necessary for a deepened understanding of the promoter function of zinc as well as the location and the mobility of different zinc species during activation procedures. Reduction by hydrogen was chosen as tool to characterize and activate promoter species. Studies of the temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen (TPR/HZ) in ref. [4] and the known activation of gallium promoted zeolites by hydrogen treatment [5,6] gave stimulations for corresponding investigations. Furthermore, our work was aimed to search for a method of quantitative determination of the portion of zinc species being the active sites. Thereby, temperature-programmed surface reaction with CO as probe molecule (TPSR/CO) seemed to be suitable to distinguish between Zn2+ ions and oxygen containing zinc species. A similar method was recently applied to determine the concentration of Zr-OH groups on zirconia pretreated with HZ [7]. Finally, a possible correlation between the activity and the concentration of defined zinc species should be investigated. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts Samples aimed to contain zinc species of different nature such as ions or oxidic particles were prepared by ion exchange (Zne) and/or impregnation (Zn;) of a parent H-ZSM-5 (Si:Al ratio of 23) as has been described in detail in part 1. A physical mixture of 2.0 wt.-% ZnO and 98.0 wt.-% H-ZSM-5 was included into the catalytic investigations (sample Znm). The ZnO has been obtained by calcining a basic zinc carbonate at 773 K. Two samples were additionally loaded with 2 wt.-% palladium by impregnation with an aqueous Pd(N03)2 solution. Hydrogen dissociation on metallic palladium should improve the reducibility of zinc species in the TPR experiments. A survey of the prepared samples, their composition, the used abbreviations and indices, indicating the content of Zn or Pd in wt-%, is given in Table 1. 2.2. Activation procedure Portions of samples Znm dried at 373 K and Zn;~1.5 calcined at 573 K as well as at 823 K were treated by an H 2/N2 flow (40% H2, 50 ml/min) at 723 K for 30 min. Afterwards, the flow was switched to the feed of the catalytic testing. A H.

The samples activated by hydrogen were designed as Znm/a, Zn;/a/,.5/573K (the last index reflects the calcination temperature). 2.3. TPR / TPSR studies TPR/H2 and TPSR/CO were carried out using the catalyst characterization system AMI-1 (Altamira, Inc.) connected to a quadruple mass spectrometer QMG 420 C (Balzers) by a gas inlet system GEV 010. TPRS plots were monitored using the multi-ion-detection mode. Catalyst samples of 0.25 g each were pretreated by heating up to 773 K in a helium flow containing 5 vol.-% Oz to remove adsorbed water and possible carbonaceous contaminations. Then the treatment gas was eluted by an inert gas flow at 773 K for 1 h. Afterwards the sample was cooled to room temperature (r.t.) under Ar or He in the case of subsequent TPR/H2 and TPSR/CO, respectively. Finally, the temperature-programmed runs were performed using the following parameters: TPR/H2: flow of 5% HZ/Ar (70 ml/min), heating up to 823 K (= 10 K/min) followed by an isothermal treatment at final temperature for 30 min; TPSR/CO: flow of 5% CO/He (40 ml/min), heating up to 923 K (= 20 K/min) followed by an isothermal treatment at final temperature for 60 min. Water or carbon dioxide formed during TPR/H2 and TPSR/CO, respectively, were removed by passing the flow through a trap filled with molecular sieve 5A or KOH before passing the thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Otherwise, the flow was dried by a trap filled with P205 in the case of mass spectrometric analysis. The TCD peak areas obtained by TPR/H2 were calibrated by Ar pulses into the H2/Ar flow, HZ and C02 pulses were applied to calibrate the TPSR/CO measurements. The CO consumption monitored by the TCD plot during the TPSR/CO is only slightly falsified by a liberation of H2 (see below) because the thermal conductivity of H2 and the carrier gas flow are quite similar. 368 H.

Temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (TPDA) The equipment and applied procedures to characterize the acidity of the catalyst by TPDA have been already described in part 1. This method was used to investigate possible changes of the acidity caused by the activation procedure described in section 2.2. 2.5. Catalytic testing The conversion of propane was carried out at normal pressure in a microflow reactor as has been described in detail in part 1. The samples were either tested after calcination at 823 K or after calcination at 573 K and subsequent hydrogen treatment at 723 K for activation. The catalytic measurements were carried out between 723 K and 803 K. 3. Results 3.1. TPR / HZ TPR profiles of the samples Zne/,,b and Zn;/,,5 are displayed in Fig. 1 as curve a and b.

The TPR profile of Zne/t.b shows an increased peak with a virtual maximum at the final temperature of the run. The HZ consumption raised to ca. 35 p,mol/g. However, this value is considerably lower than the equivalent HZ amount that would be necessary to reduce all the Znll species (245 [Lmol Zn/g) to Zn Obviously, only a small amount of Znll was reduced under the applied conditions. Additional loading of both the samples by palladium results in an improved zinc reduction. The corresponding TPR plots (c, d) revealed increased areas of the peaks shifted to lower temperatures (Zne/1.6Pd2: 92 p,mol HZ/g, Zni/1,SPdZ: 60 jimol H2/g). Pd\" reduction, HZ adsorption/desorption on Pd and (3-Pd-hydride decomposition are superimposed in the temperature range below 423 K. Nevertheless, the different reducibility of Znll in the different sample types was more significantly revealed by hydrogen activation on Pd.

Zne/1.6 shows a higher CO consumption than Zn ;/1.5. The amount of CO consumed by the Zne/1 .6 sample is approximately equivalent to the amount of exchanged zinc (CO:Zn = 1.02). This molecular ratio decreases with decreasing zinc content of the Zne samples but is still 0.66 for Zne/0,9. In contrast, the CO consumption of Zni/1.5 was relatively low (CO:Zn = 0.63). The mass spectrometric analysis of the interaction of CO with the catalysts surprisingly revealed not only the formation of carbon dioxide but also hydrogen (Fig. 3). Taking into account the three times higher ionization probability of CO2, the curves indicate an equivalent formation of carbon dioxide and hydrogen. This cannot be explained by a reduction of Znll but by a surface reaction discussed below. Fig. 4 shows the TPSR/CO plots of catalysts prepared in different ways, including the activated sample Zni/a/1.5. Only the C02 formation was displayed but the shape of the corresponding H 2 plot was similar. Always two distinct peaks were obtained that were denominated as a-and peak. The intensity of each peak and especially the ratio a/varies with the zinc content and depends on the mode of the pretreatment. A hydrogen pretreatment of the sample Zni/1.5 increases the a-peak at the expense of the y-peak, as can be seen in the curve of Zni/a/1.5' 300 250 200 8 d 150 d a h c 100 50 0 a) b) E 0,8 1.0 1.2 1,4 1,6 Zne / wt. -% Zni/1.5 Fig. 5.

The portion of a-species strongly increases with increasing Zn content whereas the portion of y-species decreases.

Moreover, Fig. 5b reveals a significant increase of the portion of ct-species at the expense of the y-species caused by hydrogen treatment of Zni/i.5* 3.3. TPDA results Fig. 6 reveals a widening and a shift of the high temperature peak of the ammonia desorption from Zni/a/1.5 to higher temperatures compared to Zni/i.5. These changes could be attributed to a generation of strongly acidic Lewis sites as has been demonstrated in part 1. The content of Lewis sites of Zni/a/1.5 increases in the sequence Zni/1.5 < Zni/a/1.5 < Zne/1.6* 3.4. Catalysis Results of the catalytic testing of Zne as well as of various Zni samples, the physical mixture Znm and the parent H-ZSM-5 are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 3. The highest conversion and the highest yield of aromatics was obtained with Zne/1.6 calcined at 823 K. A pretreatment with hydrogen had no influence on the activity and the selectivity. Sample Zni/1.5 calcined at the same temperature was considerably less active. A treatment in hydrogen at 723 K did not significantly influence the catalytic properties. However, a hydrogen treatment of the Zni/1.5 sample calcined at 573 K revealed a remarkable increase of Table 3 Propane conversion at 753 K over samples pretreated under air or air and hydrogen Sample Pretreatment Conversion Yields of products T/K % wt,-% air a HZ b aromatics CH4 C2H6 CZH4 Zn;/ 1.5 823 (723) ` 10.8 5.2 1.5 0.8 1.8 573 - 9.8 5.1 1.4 0.7 1.7 573 723 27.7 16.7 2.5 5.7 1.2 Znm 373 - 11.9 5.3 2.0 1.4 2.0 373 723 28.0 17.0 2.5 5.6 1.2 Zne/L6 823 (723) ` 47.2 22.1 5.3 16.2 0.8 a'b Pretreatment time 2 and 0.5 h, respectively.

Berndt et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 365-379 375 activity and selectivity (sample Zn;/a/,.5/573K)' The conversion raised from 10.8 to 27.7%. Otherwise, an analogous treatment under nitrogen did not improve the activity. A very similar activation was observed with Znm. It showed a low activity, significantly raising by a hydrogen treatment. Apart from this activation by hydrogen treatment a self activation was observed during catalytic testing of Znm as well as Zn;/,.5 calcined at 573 K. This effect is demonstrated for the Zn;/,.5 in Fig. 8. Znm behaved quite analogously. During the usual test procedure the reaction temperature was raised stepwise, starting at 723 K. The activity was low up to 753 K and there was no difference between the Zn;/1.5 samples calcined at 573 K or 823 K. However, the activity of the mildly calcined sample sharply increased at higher temperatures, reaching values obtained otherwise only by hydrogen treatment (sample Zn;/a/,.5/573K). The enhanced activity level remained, when the reaction temperature was again decreased to 723 K. In contrast, the activity of the Zn;/1,5 calcined at 823 K remained low in the whole temperature range of the testing. Fig. 9 shows the propane conversion at 778 K of various zinc promoted catalysts in dependence on their total zinc content as well as their amount of a-species, respectively. Whereas no relation between the total amount of introduced zinc was observed, an approximately straight-line correlation between the activity and the content of a-species was obtained. 4. Discussion The results of the TPR/HZ have revealed that only a very small proportion of ZnO in Zn; could be reduced. The reducibility in Zne was somewhat higher, but still remained below 15% of the total amount of ZnO. The obtained low degree of reduction is in line with TPR/HZ results of ZnO supported on silicalite reported Wan and Chu [4]. These authors concluded that the reduction of Zn0 hardly reaches completion even after a hydrogen treatment of 4 h at 823 K. The addition of palladium improved the reducibility of both samples. However, the difference between the two types of samples remained. The promoting effect of palladium is explainable by a spillover of hydrogen activated on the noble metal to the zinc oxide [8]. The reaction of CO with the samples is not directly comparable with that of H2. A different reaction proceeded. The formation of COz indicated the release of an oxygen atom which must be associated with an oxygen containing zinc species. The origin of the oxygen from ZnO can be excluded because the Zne sample contained only zinc ions, as demonstrated in part I [3]. Therefore, we propose the presence of a [Zn(OH)]+ ion located on Brsted sites. Such species was recently assumed by Shi et al. [9]. From a characterization of zinc species at cationic positions by XANES and EXAFS was concluded on a octahedral coordination in hydrated samples [10]. However, with increasing temperature the 376 H. Berndt et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 365-379 hydrate shell was removed and the coordination number was decreased. We believe that [Zn(H20)x]2+ species are finally hydrolyzed to [Zn(OH)]+ species. As mentioned above, only Zne/1.6 revealed a ratio CO:Zn = 1, whereas this ratio is lower for samples with lower zinc content than 1.6 wt.-%. This finding is explainable by an increasing amount of unreducible ZnO besides [Zn(OH)]+ ions. The reaction of CO with ZnO should be more difficult than with [Zn(OH)]+ ions because bulk ZnO is additionally thermodynamically stabilized by lattice energy. The reaction of the zinc promoted catalysts with CO produced not only CO2, but also equimolar amounts of H2. If hydrogen would be produced by a reaction of CO with residual water, remaining in the zeolite, then the amount of CO2 and H 2 should decrease with increasing temperature of the in-situ pretreatment of the sample. However, corresponding experiments with Zne/1.6 showed constant amounts of CO2 and H2, being equivalent to the zinc content. Therefore, a hydrogen formation by water gas shift reaction can be excluded. A formation of equimolar amounts of CO2 and HZ was also observed during the TPSR/CO of zirconia [7]. The authors explained the result by a reaction of CO with surface OH groups. In the case of our Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts we propose the following reaction equation (1): [Zn(OH)] ++ H++ CO - Zn2++ HZ + CO2 (1) This means, carbon monoxide reacts only with a hydroxyl group and a residual proton of adjacent Brsted sites, no reduction of Zn2+ ions occurs. The following reaction pathway is supposed: CO inserts into the OH groups of [Zn(OH)]+ ions, forming formiate species as surface intermediates. The latter react with protons and form CO2 and H2 in analogy to the well known mechanism of the catalytic decomposition of formic acid. However, the observed slightly lower formation of HZ compared to CO2 as well as the detection of a grey-white Zn/ZnO deposition on the reactor outlet indicated that probably a small portion of ZnII was reduced by HZ and transported in a subsequent process as zinc vapor. The appearance of two reaction peaks indicates two zinc hydroxy species of different reactivity. Considering the rankings of the a/ratio Zne/1.1 < Zni/1.5 < Zni/a/1.5 zne/1.6 It can be concluded on a higher reactivity of zinc hydroxy species located on Brsted sites in the channels denoted as [Zn(OH)]' or a-species compared to zinc hydroxy species on Brsted sites in the surface region of the crystals denoted as [Zn(OH)]S or (3-species. Fig. 6 demonstrates that the amount of species was nearly constant in all the samples despite different zinc loading. This means that the zeolite crystals contain a nearly constant number of sites, preferably exchanging zinc ions independent of the total number of supplied zinc ions. These sites should be located on easily accessible surface regions, e.g. the external surface or in the pore mouths. H. Berndt et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 365-379 377 A comparison of the zinc content with the amount of COZ resulted in a difference for all the samples, excluding Zne/,.6. This difference means that a part of zinc species denominated as y-species did not react with CO. These species should be ZnO located on the outer surface of the crystal. The distribution of the different zinc species depends not only on the zinc content and on the preparation method (Fig. 5a) but the proportion of cx- to y-species can also be varied by a hydrogen pretreatment (Fig. 5b). This pretreatment considerably increases the content of a-species at the expense of the y-species, i.e. hydrogen causes a severe structural transformation. This change is also reflected by the TPDA results, showing an increase of the amount of strongly acidic Lewis sites in Zn;/a/l.s/s73K compared to Zn;/1.s. In this way, the increased activity of Zn;/a/l.s can be related to the generation of additional very active Lewis sites (see part I). A quite similar activation effect was observed by hydrogen pretreatment of ZnR,. An analogous structural transformation seems to occur during the self activation at increased conversion at higher temperatures observed with Zn;/1.5/ 573K as well as with Zn,n. Considering the hydrogen formation by the propane conversion, this self activation can also be explained by the interaction of hydrogen with the y-species or with admixed ZnO. This conclusion is in accordance with recent results of Minatchev et al. [11]. They observed the appearance of a weak IR band, indicating Lewis sites in a mechanical mixture of ZnO and H-ZSM-5 precalcined in air. However, this band distinctly increased after catalytic conversion of isobutane over this sample. Nearly the same raising of the band was observed by pretreatment of the mixture under hydrogen. Our present results clearly indicate that the activity is related to the cx-species proposed to be Lewis-acidic [Zn(OH)]+ ions. Moreover, it could be shown that this species can be generated from y-species proposed to be ZnO. Therefore, the processes of activation and of self activation can be formulated as a transformation induced by interaction with H2: Zn0 + H+Z- - [Zn(OH)] +Z- (2) In detail, the action of hydrogen could consist of a reduction to zinc atoms, moving as vapour into the zeolite channels and reacting with protons of Brsted sites to zinc ions. A mobility of zinc in Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is well known [12] and a certain formation of metallic zinc is observed in the present experiments, too. In principle, it is also conceivable that ionic zinc species are generated by a solid state ion exchange [ 13]. However, it should be stressed that the presence of hydrogen was a necessary condition; no activation was obtained under nitrogen. Altogether, the hydrogen treatment causes a structural transformation of a Znl type as well as of a Znm type catalyst which is connected with a transportation 378 H. Berndt et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 365-379 of zinc from the outer surface of the zeolite crystal into the channels where additional Lewis-acidic, very active sites are generated. It should be mentioned that this process occurred only with mildly precalcined samples. The observed activation by hydrogen displays an interesting analogy to Ga203/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, being also very active in the aromatization of alkanes. An activation of this catalysts by a hydrogen pretreatment is well known. Extensive studies especially of mechanical mixtures revealed that hydrogen effects a migration of reduced gallium species, probably Ga+ ions, into the channels where an ion exchange at Brsted sites takes place [6,14,15]. This process has been named `reductive ion exchange' [ 16]. However, two differences must be stated compared with the activation of inactive ZnO species by hydrogen: (i) the temperature of the hydrogen activation of Zn/H-ZSM-5 is about 100 degrees lower than the one reported for Ga203/HZSM-5 [16]. This could be the reason for the easy self activation of Zn/H-ZSM-5, not observed [17] or hardly observed with Ga203/H-ZSM-5 [18], (ii) the valence state of the active and inactive zinc species is the same in contrast to the corresponding gallium species. It was a further objective of our studies to search a correlation between defined promoter species and the catalytic activity. A fair correlation of the amount of the a-species ([Zn(OH)]' ions) and the propane conversion was obtained. Otherwise, no relations of the activity to the total amount of zinc or the portion of species ([Zn(OH)]S) were found. Only a part of the introduced zinc is active, depending on the method of preparation and pretreatment. Moreover, the TPSR/CO method has proved to be a suitable method for determination of the portion of active zinc species in Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. 5. Conclusion ZnO is hardly reducible in Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, as shown by TPR/H2. TPRS/CO reveals a surface reaction of ionic zinc species, liberating equimolar amounts of CO 2 and HZ per zinc species. This result leads to the conclusion that a [Zn(OH)]+-ion located on a Brsted site is the reacting zinc species. The TPSR/CO profiles displayed two peaks, revealing different active a- and species. A third type of species, y-species proposed to be ZnO located outside the crystal, does not react with CO. Hydrogen treatment can cause an activation of catalysts impregnated by zinc salt solutions or obtained by mixing of Zn0 with H-ZSM-5. This treatment caused a transformation of y-species to a-species, i.e. a transportation of zinc species from outside the crystal into the channels, resulting in a generation of the active Lewis-acidic sites. A similar process occurs during the catalytic reaction as a so-called self activation observed with these samples being not activated by a hydrogen pretreatment. A correlation could be established between the content of a-species ([Zn(OH)]') and the H. Berndt et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 365-379 379 activity of catalysts prepared or pretreated in different ways. Consequently, a new method for the determination of the portion of active zinc species in Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts could be created, basing on the reaction of the probe molecule carbon monoxide with zinc-hydroxy cations located on Brsted sites in the zeolite channels.
