Laboratory of Organometallics, Catalysis and Ordered Materials State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing Wuhan University of Technology Wuhan China The catalytic activity of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) towards the transesterification of dimethyl carbonate with ethanol has been unprecedented assessed. The relation between the catalytic activity and the amount of base active sites has been proved as well as the inability of the Lewis acid sites alone to catalyze this transesterification. The synergic effect of both acid and base sites cannot be completely excluded and a plausible reaction mechanism has been proposed. MOF-808 resulted to be more efficient than every heterogeneous commercial catalyst. MOF-808 can be recycled up to 4 times with exceptional retention of both catalytic activity and crystal structure. Graphical abstract Image 2 Keywords Diethyl carbonate Dimethyl carbonate Ethyl methyl carbonate MOFs Acid/base active sites 1 Introduction Due to their low toxicity and ubiquitous applications in several industries (lithium-ion battery technology, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, etc.) di-ethyl carbonate (DEC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) have attracted considerable interest in the last decades [1,2]. It is, therefore, necessary to develop efficient and environmentally benign synthetic routes in order to replace the classical, dangerous and toxic synthesis via phosgene [3,4] and chloroformate [5–7] transformations (Supporting information (SI) Scheme 1 ). Among the alternative routes (direct synthesis [8,9], alcoholysis of urea [10], decarbonylation of dimethyl oxalate [11], carbonylation of ethanol/ethyl nitrite [12–14], transesterifications [5–7,15–17]), transesterification reactions are some of the most promising routes since the starting materials present low toxicity and high biodegradability, the processes do not require pressurized systems and the working temperature is considerably low. Transesterification can be catalyzed by both acid and basic catalysts even though the basic catalysts proved to be the most active catalysts, even in the particular case of the transesterification of carbonic acid di-alkyl esters [18]. The transesterification of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with EtOH to produce EMC and DEC consists in a two-step reaction where EMC is the intermediate and methanol a side product of both consecutive transformations (Scheme 1). Possible competitive reactions (hydrolysis of the di-alkyl esters and their thermal decomposition) can be minimized via reactants dehydration and working at reduced reaction temperatures [19–21]. The main drawbacks of this synthetic route consist in the unfavorable equilibrium and the formation of three homogeneous binary azeotropes (MeOH-DMC, EtOH-DMC, and EtOH-EMC) difficult to separate [22–24]. Reactive distillation (RD) is considered to be the most promising method to intensify this process for industrial applications [15,20]. Several homogeneous and heterogeneous, acid and base catalysts have been so far investigated. Unfortunately, a preferable heterogeneous catalysts usually exhibit slow kinetics and/or issues concerning their stability and recyclability. Mg-Al-O-t-Bu hydrotalcite [2], KF/Al2O3 [25] and dipotassium carbonate coated on polyethylene glycol [17,26] represent the most active catalysts reported till now. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of porous ordered materials that combine some of the best characteristics of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, can provide structures with different amounts of base and acid active sites. To the best of our knowledge, MOF 5 [16], ZIF 8 [5] and ZIF 67 [6] are the only MOFs that have been investigated as catalysts for the transesterification of DMC with DEC, while till now, no studies are reported about applications of MOFs in the transesterification of DMC with EtOH. Herein, the catalytic activity of various MOFs towards the transesterification of DMC with EtOH and the relationship between their catalytic activity and their acid/base and structural properties have been investigated unprecedented. 2 Experimental All MOFs were synthesized by previously reported procedures [27–31] and characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, and SEM. Screening of all catalysts was accomplished at 363K (90°C) and the best performing catalysts were also tested at 348K (75°C). The detailed procedures and analytical methods are reported in SI Appendix A and B. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Choice and characterization of MOFs MOFs with different amount of acid and basic active sites (SI, Table A1) were employed to investigate the relation between the catalytic activity and the acid and base properties. The amount of active sites is expressed by the quantity of sites per mass unit but can be expressed also as a quantity per area unit via dividing the values by the surface areas (m2/g). The obtained sequence, ranking the MOFs from the most to the less basic, remained unchanged while in the acidic sequence only Cr-MIL 101 change its position, becoming slightly less acidic. Since the complete removal of water from the reaction system is not possible [15], only water stable MOFs were selected. All MOFs were characterized in order to verify their structure and their textural properties that could influence their activity were determined. Textural properties are reported in Table 1 (see SI Appendix A for more details). 3.2 DMC transesterification with Ethanol over MOFs With the optimized reaction conditions (SI Appendix C), the catalytic performances of all MOFs were investigated at 363K. Table 2 summarizes the obtained results and hot filtration tests proved the true heterogeneity of all MOFs. Combined comparative studies of their textural properties and the amount of base and acid sites, demonstrated that the amount and typology of active sites are the main parameters to determine the efficiency of the catalyst, while the influence of textural properties seems much less important. The sequence obtained ranking the MOFs from the less active to the most active (Cr-MIL 101=Fe-MIL 100=inactive; UiO66<ZIF 8<ZIF 67<UiO66-SO3H≪UiO66-NH2<MOF 808) is similar as the ranking from the less to the most basic the MOF (except for UiO66-SO3H) (Tables 1 and 2). It has to be noticed, however, that MOF-808 presents the highest surface area (among the active MOFs), one of the smallest particle size and higher value of pore volume and pore size. These characteristics generally have beneficial effects on the efficiency of heterogeneous catalysts since they facilitate diffusion phenomena in and out the porous structure. Since MOF-808 presents a high amount of both acid and basic sites, it is not reasonable, at least in the first instance, to attribute its high catalytic activity to the number of the basic sites only. However, catalytic tests carried out with some of the most acid MOFs (Cr-MIL 101, Fe-MIL 100, UiO66-SO3H), revealed that the Lewis acid sites alone cannot effectively catalyze this transformation and that the insertion of Brönsted acid functionalities does not improve significantly the catalyst performance. Furthermore, UiO66-NH2 having the smallest amount of active acid sites demonstrated to be the second most active catalyst. The synergic effect of both types of active sites, when simultaneously present in the MOF structure, cannot be excluded completely. Previously, the possible effect of Lewis acid sites to activate the carbonyl group through coordination with the carbonyl oxygen, facilitating the insertion of the alcoholate anion, formed by deprotonation of ethanol, acting as basic active sites was reported [25]. To compare the catalytic activity of the best performing MOFs (UiO66-NH2 and MOF-808) with previously reported heterogeneous catalysts, the transesterification of DMC was evaluated at 348K. Figs. 1 and 2 display the production of EMC and DEC within 30h, along with the DMC conversion, over MOF-808 and UiO66-NH2 respectively. In Table 3 , the results are compared with the most active heterogeneous catalyst so far reported. Comparison between the results obtained at 348K with those achieved at 363K reveals a better retention of the catalytic performance for MOF 808. The DEC yield obtained with UiO66-NH2 drops from 19.8% (in 24h) to 10.2% (in 28h) while with MOF 808 the yield decreased from 35.6% to 29.9%, besides, the equilibrium was achieved within 24h. The different behavior could be due to the fact that MOF-808 benefits of the synergic effect of both acid and base sites and/or the textural properties of MOF-808 facilitate diffusion steps and promote the contact between the active sites and the reactants. The reported results demonstrate that MOF-808 provides a better performance compared with every commercially available acid and base solid catalyst. To the best of our knowledge, among all the heterogeneous catalysts reported so far, only three catalysts have been found more active than MOF-808: potassium carbonate coated with polyethylene glycol [17,26], KF supported on Al2O3 [25] and Al-Mg-O-t-Bu hydrotalcite [2]. However, the reported results for the hydrotalcite could not be compared with the other catalysts since the reaction was carried on with a reactive distillation (RD) column to remove the side-product (MeOH), shifting the equilibrium towards the desired products. KF/Al2O3 represents the most active catalyst but its catalytic activity drops drastically if re-used after filtration. Regarding the K2CO3 coated with polyethylene glycol system, instead, structural damage was reported when the catalyst was employed in an RD column [20]. In order to investigate the stability and reusability of MOF-808, recycle tests were accomplished, and the crystal structure was monitored by X-ray diffraction after each test. DMC conversion, EMC yield and DEC yield for each recycle are shown in Table 3 while, the XRD pattern of fresh and recycled MOF-808 are given in SI Fig. D1. Both conversion and selectivity were well retained. 3.3 Reaction mechanism on amphoteric MOF-808 MOF-808, Zr6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4-(BTC)2(HCO2)6, is an amphoteric MOF with a well-defined crystal structure [32]. Its amphoteric nature derived from the simultaneous presence of acid (Zr4+) and basic (O2−) sites developed from Zr-O-Zr and Zr-OH-Zr species [31]. The trans-esterification reactions can be catalyzed by both acid and basic catalyst since both the carbonyl group of esters and the hydroxyl groups of alcohols can be activated in order to facilitate the nucleophilic substitution. Bi-functional catalysts are therefore able to activate the two substrates simultaneously. In the light of this general knowledge a plausible reaction mechanism for the formation of EMC by reaction of ethanol and DMC on the metal center of MOF-808 is proposed (Fig. 3 ). The acid active sites interact with lone pair electrons of the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group of the carbonate, increasing the positive charge of the carbon atom of the carbonyl group that becomes more disposed to receive additional negative charged from the alcohol/alcoholate ion. On the other hand, the basic sites interact with the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group of the alcohol, weakening or breaking the OH bond. In the first case, the interaction creates a formal negative charge on the hydroxyl oxygen, while in the second one an alcoholate ion is formed. In both cases, the resulting species is more inclined to act as nucleophile compared to the original alcohol. During the last step of the reaction mechanism, the side-product methanol is formed re-generating the active site. 4 Conclusions The transesterification of DMC with EtOH to produce EMC and DEC have been unprecedented assessed over MOFs as catalysts. The relation between the catalytic performances and the amount of base active sites as well as the inability of the contained Lewis acid sites alone to catalyzed this transformation has been investigated. Furthermore, insertion of Brönsted base sites resulted to be much more effective compared to the insertion of the acid sites. However, a synergic effect of both Lewis acid and base sites cannot be excluded for the most active amphoteric MOF-808. The catalytic performance of MOF-808 is superior to any heterogeneous commercially available catalyst and can be recycled up to 4 times with exceptional retention of activity and crystal structure. MOF-808, therefore, demonstrated to be a useful catalyst candidate for the transesterification of DMC with EtOH.
