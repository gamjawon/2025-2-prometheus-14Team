The obtained catalyst samples were characterized using N2 adsorption, Xâ€�ray diffraction, ultraâ€� violetâ€�visible diffuse reflectance, CO chemisorption, Xâ€�ray photoelectron spectroscopy, 27 Al magâ€� icâ€�angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, and infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine. Compared to the catalyst prepared using the variable pH method, the catalyst prepared using the constant pH method had a higher surface area and Pt dispersion. More BrÃ¶nsted acid sites were generated in the presence of H2 on the latter catalyst, and this was responsible for its higher catalytâ€� ic activity in nâ€�heptane hydroisomerization. When the reaction temperature was 200 Â°C and the weight hourly space velocity of nâ€�heptane was 0.9 h â€“1 , the Pt/WO3/Al2O3â€�ZrO2 catalyst prepared using the constant pH method gave 70.0% conversion of nâ€�heptane, which was significantly greater than the conversion obtained using the corresponding catalyst prepared using the variable pH method (43.5%).

Introduction In order to improve the quality of gasoline and enable it to better meet environmental protection regulations, there has been a sharp rise in the demand for processes that can produce clean fuels with nonâ€�aromatic hydrocarbons and high octane numbers [1,2]. One potential solution is to isomerize C7+ nâ€�alkanes (C7 and higher paraffins), which are a major constitâ€� uent of some crude oil fractions, to their highâ€�octaneâ€�number branched isomers as octaneâ€�enhancing components. Unlike the case of isomerization of C4ï€­C6 light nâ€�paraffins, during the isomerization of longâ€�chain C7+ nâ€�alkanes, cracking caused by Î²â€�scission occurs easily, resulting in lower selectivity for branched isomers, especially at high conversion. Various catalysts have been investigated for the isomerizaâ€� tion of nâ€�heptane, mainly based on Pt or Pd catalysts loaded on SAPO molecular sieves [3], zeolites [4], heteropolyacids [5], SO4 2â€“ /ZrO2 [6], and WO3/ZrO2 [7ï€­9]. Among the catalysts studâ€� ied, Pt/WO3/ZrO2 displayed superior catalytic performance. Compared with traditional Pt/zeolite catalysts, Pt/WO3/ZrO2 exhibits higher activities at lower temperatures because of its stronger acidity [10ï€­12]. The Pt/WO3/ZrO2 catalyst displays much higher isomerization selectivity and longer stability than does Pt/SO4 2â€“ /ZrO2 [7,10,13]. Pt/WO3/ZrO2 has therefore reâ€� cently received more attention. Hua et al. [14] found that inâ€� corporating small amounts of Al2O3 into the Pt/WO3/ZrO2 sysâ€� tem enhanced the catalytic activity in nâ€�heptane isomerization. This promoting effect of Al2O3 in Pt/WO3/ZrO2 was later conâ€� firmed by Xu et al. [15]. Liu et al. [16] reported that the addition of an appropriate amount of ZnO to Pt/WO3/ZrO2 led to a * Corresponding author.

Catal., Vol. 34, No. 5, May 2013 SHANG Shuning et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 898â€“905 moderate increase in the selectivity and yield of C7 isomers in nâ€�heptane isomerization. In our previous work [17,18], we also observed that adding small amounts of Ga2O3 or In2O3 to Pt/WO3/ZrO2 improved the conversion and selectivity in nâ€�heptane isomerization. However, there has been no report on the influence of the preparative method on Pt/WO3/ZrO2â€�based catalysts for nâ€�heptane isomerization. In the present work, Al2O3â€�doped Pt/WO3/ZrO2 catalysts prepared by constant and variable pH methods, respectively, were tested in nâ€�heptane isomerization. The reasons for the effect of the preparative method on the catalytic activity were explored, based on characterization results. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation ZrO(NO3)2âˆ™7H2O (Zibo Rongruida Powder Material Factory, 35 g) and the required amount of Al(NO3)3âˆ™9H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.) were dissolved in water (400 ml). This solution and an ammonia aqueous solution (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. ltd., 6 mol/L) were simultaneously added dropwise to 200 ml of ammonia aqueous solution of pH = 9 under vigorous stirring. During coprecipitation, the pH was kept constant at 9. The hydroxide suspension was aged for 24 h at room temperature. The precipitate was then filtered, washed, and dried overnight. WO3/Al2O3â€“ZrO2 (denoted by WAZâ€�C) was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of Al(OH)3â€�Zr(OH)4 with an aqueous solution of ammonium metâ€� atungstate (Aldrich), followed by drying and then calcination in static air at 800 Â°C for 3 h. WO3/Al2O3â€�ZrO2 prepared by anothâ€� er method was denoted WAZâ€�V. In this case, ammonia solution (6 mol/L) was added dropwise to a mixed aqueous solution of ZrO(NO3)2âˆ™7H2O and Al(NO3)3âˆ™9H2O until the final pH was 9. The subsequent preparation steps were the same as those for WAZâ€�C. In both the WAZâ€�C and WAZâ€�V samples, the WO3 loadâ€� ing was 18% and the Al/Zr molar ratio was 0.02. Pt/WAZâ€�C and Pt/WAZâ€�V catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness imâ€� pregnation of WAZâ€�C or WAZâ€�V with an aqueous solution of [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2 (Aldrich), followed by drying and then calciâ€� nation in an air flow at 450 Â°C for 3 h. The Pt content of each catalyst was 1%. 2.2. Catalyst characterization Xâ€�ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed usâ€� ing a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (Cu K ï�¡ , tube potential 40 kV, tube current 40 mA, 2Î¸ = 20Â°ï€­70Â°, 4Â°/min). The Brunauerâ€�Emmettâ€�Teller (BET) surface areas were analyzed using N2 adsorption at â€“196 Â°C with a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument. Before measurements, each sample was degassed at 300 Â°C for 3 h. Diffuse reflectance ultravioletâ€�visible (UVâ€�Vis) spectra were collected on a Shimadzu UVâ€�2450 spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment using BaSO4 as the reference. The Pt dispersions on the WAZâ€�C and WAZâ€�V supports were determined using a pulsed CO chemisorption technique with a Micromeritics AutoChem II apparatus loaded with 0.3 g of catalyst. The catalyst was activated at 450 Â°C in an air flow for 2 h, reduced in an H2 flow at 250 Â°C for 2 h, and then swept under the He flow at 250 Â°C for 1 h. The catalyst was then cooled to room temperature and a pulse of 5%COâ€�95%He mixture was repeatedly injected into the reactor until the CO signals from the thermal conductivity detector remained conâ€� stant. He was used as the carrier gas. The volume of CO chemiâ€� sorbed was determined by summing the fractions of CO conâ€� sumed in each pulse. Toluene hydrogenation was carried out at 160 Â°C in a pulsed microreactor loaded with 50 mg of catalyst. The carrier gas was H2 at a flow rate of 40 ml/min. The amount of toluene injected for each test was 1 ï�­l. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was first activated at 450 Â°C in an air flow for 2 h, and then reduced at 250 Â°C in an H2 flow for 2 h. 27 Al magâ€� icâ€�angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) measurements were performed using a Bruker DSXâ€�300 specâ€� trometer. A resonance frequency of 78.2 MHz, a recycle delay of 0.2 s, and short 0.3 ï�­s pulses were applied. Xâ€�ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out using a Perkinâ€�Elmer PHI 5000C spectrometer with Mg K ï�¡ radiation as the excitation source. All binding energy values were referâ€� enced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. Prior to the measurements, the catalyst was first activated at 450 Â°C in an air flow for 2 h, and then reduced at 250 Â°C in an H2 flow for 2 h. Infrared (IR) spectra of adsorbed pyridine were recorded on a Nicolet Nexus 470 FTâ€�IR spectrometer, which was furnished with an inâ€�situ sample cell. A selfâ€�supporting disk of the sample was first deâ€� gassed at 300 Â°C for 4 h, and then cooled to 100 Â°C to adsorb pyridine. After evacuation at 150 Â°C, the IR spectra were recâ€� orded. Cumene cracking was carried out at 250 Â°C in a pulsed microreactor loaded with 50 mg of catalyst. The amount of cumene injected for each test was 1 ï�­l. The flow rate of the carrier gas was 40 ml/min. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was first activated at 450 Â°C in an air flow for 2 h, and then reâ€� duced at 250 Â°C in an H2 flow for 2 h when H2 was used as the carrier gas. When He was used as the carrier gas, the catalyst was activated at 450 Â°C in an air flow for 2 h. 2.3. Activity evaluation The hydroisomerization of nâ€�heptane was performed at 200 Â°C in a flow fixedâ€�bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst loading was 0.3 g. nâ€�Heptane was introduced to the reactor using H2 as a carrier gas (30 ml/min), flowing through a saturator maintained at 15 Â°C, which gave an H2/nâ€�heptane molar ratio of 27:1. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of nâ€�heptane was 0.9 h âˆ’1 . Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was first activated at 450 Â°C in an air flow for 2 h, and then reduced at 250 Â°C in an H2 flow for 2 h. The products were analyzed using an onâ€�line gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and an HPâ€�PONA capillary column (50 m Ã— 0.2 mm Ã— 0.5 ï�­m). The oven temperature was kept at 70 Â°C. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Phase structure and surface area SHANG Shuning et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 898â€“905 Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of the Pt/WAZâ€�C and Pt/WAZâ€�V catalysts prepared using different methods. Both catalysts displayed a mixture of the tetragonal and monoclinic phases of zirconia, but primarily the tetragonal phase. The Pt/WAZâ€�C catalyst exhibited stronger diffraction peaks characâ€� teristic of tetragonal ZrO2 than Pt/WAZâ€�V did, whereas the peaks attributed to monoclinic ZrO2 were weaker for the forâ€� mer catalyst. These results suggested that the constant pH method helped to stabilize the tetragonal phase of zirconia in the catalyst and inhibited the transformation from the metaâ€� stable tetragonal phase to the monoclinic phase at the high calcination temperature. This was related to the fact that a higher number of Al 3+ ions were incorporated into the ZrO2 lattice in the Pt/WAZâ€�C catalyst prepared using the constant pH method. The characteristic peaks of crystalline WO3 appeared in both catalysts, but the diffraction intensities for Pt/WAZâ€�C were weaker than those for Pt/WAZâ€�V. This indicated that WO3 was better dispersed in Pt/WAZâ€�C, and this was associated with its higher surface area. The surface areas of the Pt/WAZâ€�C and Pt/WAZâ€�V catalysts were 45 and 30 m 2 /g, respectively (Table 1). 3.2. UVâ€�Vis diffuse reflectance and Pt dispersion Figure 2 shows the diffuse reflectance UVâ€�Vis spectra of WAZâ€�C and WAZâ€�V samples. The absorption edge energies are listed in Table 1. The absorption edge energy was slightly greater for WAZâ€�C (3.32 eV) than for WAZâ€�V (3.19 eV), reflectâ€� ing a smaller WO3 domain size in the former sample [19], i.e., better dispersion of WO3. This was consistent with the XRD observations. The Pt dispersions on the Pt/WAZâ€�C and Pt/WAZâ€�V cataâ€� lysts were estimated from CO chemisorption. The results are listed in Table 1. The Pt dispersion on the Pt/WAZâ€�C catalyst was 23%, which was higher than that in Pt/WAZâ€�V (18%). This was probably related to the greater surface area of the former catalyst. The metallic properties of Pt in the catalysts were furâ€� ther investigated using toluene hydrogenation. As shown in Table 1, the Pt/WAZâ€�C catalyst gave 41.8% conversion in hyâ€� drogenation of toluene, which was greater than the conversion obtained using Pt/WAZâ€�V (34.7%). This demonstrated that Pt exhibited better metallic properties in Pt/WAZâ€�C, which was in agreement with the higher Pt dispersion on this catalyst. 3.3. 27 Al MAS NMR and XPS To investigate the coordination environments of Al in the Pt/WAZâ€�C and Pt/WAZâ€�V catalysts prepared using different methods, 27 Al MAS NMR spectroscopic measurements were carried out. The results are shown in Fig. 3. Both catalysts disâ€� played an intense peak at Î´ = 0.4, assigned to sixâ€�coordinated Al. The narrower resonance signal observed for Pt/WAZâ€�C than for Pt/WAZâ€�V implied that the chemical environment of the octahedral Al species in the former catalyst, which was preâ€� pared using the constant pH method, was more uniform. An additional weak peak that appeared at around Î´ = 25 was atâ€� tributed to Al species in a disordered state. This was probably associated with Al species incorporated into the ZrO2 lattice [20]. After peak deconvolution, the ratio of this Al species to octahedral Al species was 0.51 in Pt/WAZâ€�C and 0.40 in 20 30 40 50 60 70 WO 3 Monoclinic ZrO 2 ï�± ï‚¢ ï‚˜ ï�± ï�± ï‚˜ ï�± ï‚˜ ï‚¢ ï‚˜ ï‚˜ ï�± 2ï�±/( o ) I n t e n s i t y ï‚˜ ï‚¢ Tetragonal ZrO 2 (1) (2) Fig. 1.

SHANG Shuning et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 898â€“905 Pt/WAZâ€�V, suggesting that more Al 3+ ions were incorporated into the ZrO2 lattice in the Pt/WAZâ€�C catalyst prepared using the constant pH method. This can be understood as follows. During preparation using the variable pH method, Al 3+ and Zr 4+ were precipitated at different pH values, resulting in relatively poor dispersion of Al 3+ . In contrast, during preparation using the constant pH method, Al 3+ and Zr 4+ were simultaneously precipitated, leading to better dispersion of Al 3+ . A higher level of Al 3+ substitution in the ZrO2 lattice was therefore achieved in the calcined catalyst. Figure 4 displays the W 4f XPS spectra of the catalysts after reduction in flowing H2 at 250 Â°C for 2 h. The XPS data obtained using a peakâ€�fitting program are listed in Table 1. The W 4f transition can be deconvoluted into two doublet peaks with binding energies of ca. 35.5 and 34.5 eV (W 4f7/2), assigned to W 6+ and W 5+ , respectively [11]. As can be seen from Table 1, the ratio of W 5+ to W 6+ was higher for Pt/WAZâ€�C (0.77) than for Pt/WAZâ€�V (0.52), showing that more surface W 6+ species in the Pt/WAZâ€�C catalyst were reduced to W 5+ species. 3.4. Surface acidity The acidic properties of the WAZâ€�C and WAZâ€�V supports were investigated using IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine. After calibration of the sample weight, the relative numbers of BrÃ¶nsted (B) and Lewis (L) acid sites were expressed in terms of the integrated areas of the absorbance peaks at 1540 and 1450 cm âˆ’1 , respectively [21]. The results are given in Fig. 5. The WAZâ€�C sample had B acidity equivalent to that of WAZâ€�V, but the former sample had more L acid sites. Taking the 27 Al MAS NMR results (Fig. 3) into account, the presence of more L acid sites on the WAZâ€�C support was probably related to the fact that more Al 3+ ions were incorporated into the ZrO2 lattice in this sample. Cumene cracking is a typical reaction catalyzed only by B acid sites [22]. Figure 6 shows the catalytic activities of the Pt/WAZâ€�C and Pt/WAZâ€�V catalysts for cumene cracking in H2 and He, respectively. In an He carrier, cumene conversion deâ€� creased with increasing pulse number, indicative of catalyst deactivation. The catalysts had the same initial activities for cumene cracking (ca. 20%), suggesting that the inherent B acidity was equivalent in the catalysts. In an H2 carrier, cumene conversion was almost unchanged after four consecutive doses. The Pt/WAZâ€�C catalyst exhibited significantly higher activity in cumene cracking than Pt/WAZâ€�V did (~76% vs ~47%), indiâ€� cating that there were more B acid sites on the former catalyst than on the latter one in the presence of H2. A comparison of the activities for cumene cracking in H2 and He atmospheres revealed that more new B acid sites were generated on the Pt/WAZâ€�C catalyst in H2. Triwahyono et al. [23] proposed that the generation of B acid sites on Pt/WO3/ZrO2 in H2 involved the following steps. Hydrogen molecules were adsorbed on Pt sites to form hydrogen atoms, which underwent spillover onto the surface of the WO3/ZrO2 support, and reached L acid sites, where each hydrogen atom donated an electron to the L acid site and became a B acid site (H + ). Meanwhile, a second spiltover hydrogen atom reacted with the electron trapped by the L acid site to form a hydride (H ï€­ ). Ebitani et al. [24] directly confirmed the formation of B acid sites in a Pt/SO4 2âˆ’ /ZrO2 catâ€� alyst during H2 treatment, using IR spectra of adsorbed pyriâ€� dine. Hence, according to the mechanism of B acid site generaâ€� tion proposed by Ebitani et al., the formation of more B acid sites on Pt/WAZâ€�C than on Pt/WAZâ€�V in H2 was caused by the higher Pt dispersion on the former catalyst and the presence of more L acid sites on the WAZâ€�C support than on the WAZâ€�V support. 42 40 38 36 34 32 30 28 26 W 5+ W 6+ W 5+ * (1) * I n t e n s i t y Binding energy (eV) * W 6+ (2) Zr 2p Fig. 4.

SHANG Shuning et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 898â€“905 3.5. Catalytic activity The catalytic performances of the catalysts for nâ€�heptane hydroisomerization were investigated at 200 Â°C. The catalytic activities remained almost stable for 3 h. The reaction data after 3 h on stream are listed in Table 2. The conversion of nâ€�heptane was obviously higher on Pt/WAZâ€�C (70.0%) than on Pt/WAZâ€�V (43.5%), demonstrating that the method used to prepare the Al2O3â€�doped Pt/WO3/ZrO2 catalyst had a signifiâ€� cant influence on the activity in nâ€�heptane isomerization. The catalyst prepared using the constant pH method exhibited sigâ€� nificantly higher activity than that shown by the catalyst preâ€� pared using the variable pH method. The isomerization selecâ€� tivity was a little lower on Pt/WAZâ€�C (97.5%) than on Pt/WAZâ€�V (98.9%). In terms of isomer distribution, the Pt/WAZâ€�C catalyst gave more dibranched and tribranched C7 isomers than Pt/WAZâ€�V did (27.8% vs 17.2%). The isomerizaâ€� tion of nâ€�heptane in the presence of H2 takes place as consecuâ€� tive reactions: nâ€�heptane ï‚® monobranched products ï‚® multiâ€� branched products [25]. More dibranched and tribranched C7 isomers were therefore obtained at higher conversion. Similar results were reported by Xu et al. [15]. The results for cumene cracking (Fig. 6) revealed that the Pt/WAZâ€�C catalyst had significantly more B acid sites in H2 than Pt/WAZâ€�V did. This was responsible for the much higher cataâ€� lytic activity in nâ€�heptane hydroisomerization observed over the former catalyst than over the latter one. However, Barton et al. [26] pointed out that carbocations are stabilized by the reâ€� duced WO x domains. More surface WO x species were reduced on Pt/WAZâ€�C than on Pt/WAZâ€�V (Fig. 4 and Table 1), suggestâ€� ing that more carbocation intermediates existed on the surface of the former catalyst. This is another reason for the catalytic activity in nâ€�heptane hydroisomerization over Pt/WAZâ€�C being higher than that over Pt/WAZâ€�V. 4. Conclusions Aluminaâ€�doped Pt/WO3/ZrO2 catalysts were prepared using either a constant pH or variable pH method. The preparative method had a significant influence on the catalytic activity in nâ€�heptane hydroisomerization. The catalyst prepared using the constant pH method had higher Pt dispersion and its support had more L acid sites, leading to generation of more B acid sites on this catalyst in H2. The catalysts possessed equivalent numâ€� bers of inherent B acid sites, so the significantly higher activity in nâ€�heptane hydroisomerization observed with the Pt/WO3/ Al2O3â€�ZrO2 catalyst prepared using the constant pH method compared with that of the catalyst prepared using the variable pH method was a consequence of generation of more B acid sites on the former catalyst in H2.

Tel: +86-21-65642792; Fax: +86-21-65641740 Alumina-doped Pt/WO3/ZrO2 catalysts were prepared using either a constant or variable pH method. The obtained catalyst samples were characterized using N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance, CO chemisorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, 27Al magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, and infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine. Compared to the catalyst prepared using the variable pH method, the catalyst prepared using the constant pH method had a higher surface area and Pt dispersion. More Brönsted acid sites were generated in the presence of H2 on the latter catalyst, and this was responsible for its higher catalytic activity in n-heptane hydroisomerization. When the reaction temperature was 200 °C and the weight hourly space velocity of n-heptane was 0.9 h−1, the Pt/WO3/Al2O3-ZrO2 catalyst prepared using the constant pH method gave 70.0% conversion of n-heptane, which was significantly greater than the conversion obtained using the corresponding catalyst prepared using the variable pH method (43.5%). 摘要 采用恒pH法和非恒pH法制备了Al2O3掺杂的Pt/WO3/ZrO2催化剂, 并用N2吸附-脱附、X射线衍射、紫外-可见漫反射、CO化学吸附、X射线光电子能谱、27Al魔角旋转核磁共振和吡啶吸附红外等技术对催化剂进行了表征. 结果表明, 相比于非恒pH法制备的催化剂, 恒pH法制备的催化剂具有较高的比表面积和Pt分散度, 在H2气氛中产生更多的B酸位, 从而表现出更高的催化正庚烷临氢异构化反应活性; 在200 °C和质量空速0.9 h−1的反应条件下, 正庚烷转化率达70.0%, 明显高于非恒pH法制备的催化剂(43.5%). Graphical Abstract An Al2O3-doped Pt/WO3/ZrO2 catalyst prepared using a constant pH method exhibited significantly higher activity in n-heptane hydroisomerization than did the corresponding catalyst prepared using a variable pH method. This was because more Brnsted acid sites were generated on the former catalyst in the presence of H2.
