Graphical abstract A complete mechanism for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO by nanographene − rhenium complex (Re(gpy-bpy)(CO)3Cl, gpy = nanographene connected with pyrazine; bpy = 2,2’-bipyridyl) was investigated by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The reaction free energies, reaction barrier heights, charge decomposition analysis (CDA), spin densities and mulliken populations provide deep insight into the reaction mechanism as well as the origin of selectivity for this catalyst. Protonation and then reduction of Re(gpy-bpy)(CO)3COOH (Re-COOH) precedes Brønsted-acid-catalyzed C − OH bond cleavage and then CO release at external applied potential. It is expected that the present work would provide valuable information for designing catalyst. Keywords CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) Density functional theory (DFT) Charge decomposition analysis (CDA) Selectivity Molecular dynamics 1 Introduction There has been a significant increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) due to an increasing reliance on fossil fuel and commodity chemicals over the past few decades. Recently, CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has firstly surpassed 400 ppm in recorded history, representing an important accelerator of global climate change [1–5]. CO2 is well known as greenhouse gas and waste product, which causes global warming as well as negative environmental impacts. Minimizing adverse environmental effects of the increasing CO2 in the atmosphere is an urgent scientific and social problem. In this regard, the CO2 conversion into fuels and other useful materials is great potential, which could decrease CO2 concentration and mitigate energy shortages [6–14]. In past decades, the efforts have been made to CO2 transformations such as thermochemical, electrochemical, and photochemical methods [15–18]. The electrochemical CO2 reduction becomes more attractive as the reaction can be conducted at ambient conditions and the reaction rate is easily controlled by tuning the overpotential. The products are produced at different electrodes and can be separated naturally, which minimizes the cost associated with post-reaction separation process [19–22]. The use of molecular catalysts to aid CO2 reduction is a relatively old concept [23] which has become quite popular lately. The molecular catalysts possess high selectivity, high activity and low environmental impact, however, the stability and recyclability may be the problems for industrial development [24–25]. In recent decades, the molecular catalysts containing transition metals (TMs) for CO2 reduction have been pursued [26–28]. It is reported that cis-Re2Cl2 and trans-Re2Cl2 comprised of two rhenium active sites can electrocatalytically convert CO2 to CO with faradaic efficiency of 47 ± 3 % and 49 ± 6 %, respectively [29]. In addition, electrocatalytic study on CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) by cis-[Rh(bpy)2X2]+ (X is Cl or TFMS) show the polypyridyl ligand is regarded as “electron reservoir” due to the bpy-based reduction of cis-[Rh(bpy)2X2]+ [30]. The fac-Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl complex (bpy = 2,2’-bipyridine) and its derivatives are also effective catalysts for CO2 reduction [26,31]. Previous mechanistic studies reported that two independent pathways for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO by fac-Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl exist: one-electron pathway and two-electron pathway [26]. In one-electron pathway, fac-Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl is reduced by one electron before it binds to CO2. For two-electron pathway, fac-Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl is reduced by two electrons before it binds to CO2. The second reduction of fac-Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl is assigned to a metal-based reduction, producing the anion [Re0(bpy-R•−)(CO)3]− [31]. In addition, the CO2 reduction by two-electron-reduced species of fac-Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl is more efficient than that of one-electron-reduced species. Qiao and co-workers synthesized nanographenes as the diimine ligand to tune the reduction potentials of ReI(α-diimine)(CO)3X complex for improved energy efficiency in CO2 reduction [32]. Due to the size-dependent optical and redox properties of nanographenes, especially containing pyrazinyl, a proton-coupled two-electron reduction was carried out to electrocatalyze the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline aqueous electrolytes, which is a kinetically sluggish multielectron reaction [33–34]. It is expected that such nanographene containing pyrazinyl structure may serve as electron storage for multielectron CO2 reduction. Recently, the nanographene − rhenium complex (Scheme 1 ) was synthesized and was able to selectively catalyze CO2 to CO (Scheme 1) in THF/methanol (vol./vol. 95/5) mixture solution [32]. The details of reaction process for CO2RR catalyzed by nanographene − rhenium complex are still ambiguous, and the interpretation of high selectivity for CO2 reduction is not quite clear. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the key intermediates and transition states involved in CO2RR. To this end, we theoretically studied the catalytic cycle of CO2 reduction by nanographene − rhenium complex (Scheme 1). For computational convenience, a simplified model Re-Cl (Re(gpy-bpy)(CO)3Cl, gpy = nanographene connected with pyrazine; bpy = 2,2’-bipyridyl) was adopted, in which the R substituents of nanographene − rhenium complex are replaced by H atoms (Scheme 1). We intend to solve the following questions: (1) How does the active catalyst generate? (2) What is the specific mechanism of this reaction under the external applied potential? (3) What is the possible reason for CO2 reduction over H+ reduction? (4) Which role does the gpy-bpy ligand play in this complex? In present work, both thermodynamic and kinetic properties of catalytic cycle are analyzed and the proposed reaction mechanism for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO by Re(gpy-bpy)(CO)3Cl is shown in Scheme S1. Based on the optimal reaction pathway, the charge decomposition analysis (CDA), spin densities, structural characteristics and charge analyses of intermediates are investigated. It is expected that the present work can inspire the rational design of molecular catalysts with improved performances for CO2RR. 2 Computational methods All the calculations were performed in the Gaussian 09 package [35]. The optimizations were performed by using B3LYP-D3 [36]. For Re metal atom, the LANL2DZ [37] basis set was used, and 6−31 G(d) basis set was used for C, N, O, H and Cl atoms, respectively [38]. The solvent effect was taken into consideration using conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) approach based on tetrahydrofuran (ε = 7.43) [39]. Based on the optimized structure, the single-point energy was obtained at B3LYP-D3/6-311++G(d,p)/LANL2DZ level [40]. In addition, the entropy change is also considered (details in supporting information) [41–42]. The reduction potentials referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) were computed by E = − Δ G ° n e ∙ F − E r e f ° (4.24) [43]. For the free energy change of a general reduction: A + n e e - → A - n e , the Δ G ° can be expressed as: Δ G ° = G( A - n e ) − G( A ) − n e G( e - ), the value for G(e−) is taken as an electron referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) in water: –4.24 V [43]. The explicit solvation energy of the proton in THF (−264.2 kcal/mol, details in supporting information) for the reaction free energy calculations and a methanol molecule as an explicit proton source for the barrier calculations were used [44]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The generation process of active catalyst As mentioned above, two-electron pathway is more efficient than one-electron pathway for Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl (bpy = 2,2’- bipyridine) reduction before binding CO2. Thus, three kinds of mechanisms for catalyst activation process are evaluated in present work: (1) synergistic mechanism A (case A), (2) synergistic mechanism B (case B) and (3) stepwise mechanism (Fig. 1 ). The energy profiles of three kinds of mechanisms under the external applied potential (referenced to −0.86 V vs. SHE, which was used in experiment) are shown in Fig. 1. The case A consists of two steps: (I) the first one electron reduction and dechlorination of Re-Cl occur simultaneously to form Re(gpy-bpy)(CO)3 (Re), (II) the second one electron reduction of Re yields [Re]− . These two steps are endothermic of 20.4 and 9.7 kcal/mol, respectively. Case B also consists of two steps: (I) the first one electron reduction of Re-Cl forms [Re-Cl]− , and (II) [Re-Cl]− loses Cl − ligand upon the second one electron reduction to afford [Re]− . These two steps are endothermic of 4.0 and 26.1 kcal/mol, respectively. In stepwise mechanism process, the ΔG values of twice successive one electron reduction and Cl – dissociation from Re-Cl are 4.0, 26.3 and −0.2 kcal/mol, respectively. The energetically favorable processes can be concluded: firstly, the [Re-Cl]− is formed by one electron reduction of Re-Cl at −1.03 V vs. SHE, and then the second one electron reduction of [Re-Cl]− with losing of Cl− at −1.99 V or the second reduction at −2.00 V followed by a slightly downhill dechlorination step (ΔG =−0.20 kcal/mol) occurs. Finally, complex [Re] − is formed. The spin density analysis shows that the added electron mainly localizes on the gpy-bpy ligand upon one electron reduction of Re-Cl (Figure S1A). Thus it is better to describe [Re-Cl]− as ligand (gpy-bpy) centered species [ReI(gpy-bpy•−)(CO)3Cl]−, which is similar to [Re(bpy•−)(CO)3X]− by first reduction of Re(bpy)(CO)3X (X = Cl− or Br−) [45]. Upon the second reduction, the added electron significantly delocalizes on the gpy-bpy ligand (Figure S1B), which is different to the previous work on Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl that the second reduction occurs primarily at metal center [24]. This fact highlights the important ‘electron reservoir’ role of the gpy-bpy ligand. 3.2 The selectivity of active catalyst Experimentally, the active catalyst [Re]− exhibits a remarkable selectivity toward CO2 reduction over H+ reduction [32]. Therefore, the reaction is likely to proceed as CO2 + 2e− + 2H+ → CO + H2O. In general, protons in the formula can be generated by Hofmann degradation of the quaternary alkylammonium cation of the supporting electrolyte under anhydrous conditions [24,28,46]. However, Brønsted acid is frequently added to polar aprotic solvents to promote the proton-coupled reduction of CO2 and significantly enhance the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity [47]. Indeed, the adequately enhanced current is observed after the addition of the Brønsted acid methanol (CH3OH) relative to anhydrous THF in the experiment [32]. Thus, methanol is used as proton source in present study. In order to reveal the origin of this selectivity, the potential energy surfaces of CO2/H+ addition to [Re]− were compared and shown in Fig. 2 . Starting from [Re]− , the H+ coordination occurs via the transition state TS1 to produce Re(gpy-bpy)(CO)3H (Re-H), which requires ΔG≠ value of 34.0 kcal/mol and has ΔG value of −43.6 kcal/mol. In addition, when an additional CH3OH molecule interacting with the reacting CH3OH by hydrogen bond was considered, the barrier height decreases to 22.2 kcal/mol. For CO2 coordination, [Re-CO2]− is produced via the transition state TS2 from [Re]− , which requires ΔG≠ value of 5.8 kcal/mol and ΔG value of 3.9 kcal/mol. The energy barrier (ΔG≠) for H+ coordination is larger than that of CO2 coordination when CH3OH is used as proton source. Thus, the H+ coordination process is kinetically unfavorable. The CO2RR on fac-Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl indicated that the stronger Brønsted acid has ability to lower the reaction barrier of H+ coordination to active catalyst [48]. If the Brønsted acid is strong enough, e.g., HCl, H+ reduction to H2 is favorable over CO2 reduction. Thus, the acidicity in solution should be considered in the rational design of catalyst for CO2RR. The CO2 coordination is favored at pH range about 5-9. In slightly acidic solution, especially in slightly basic (generally pH = 7.8) solution, the CO2 coordination is more favored [49]. The electronic processes for CO2/H+ coordinating with [Re] − are investigated with fragment molecular orbitals analyses. As shown in Fig. 3 A, TS1 is divided into CH3OH and [Re] − moieties. Charge decomposition analysis (CDA) clearly indicates that 0.215e is transferred from the HOMO of [Re] − to the LUMO of CH3OH in H+ coordination [50]. The HOMO of [Re] − in TS1 mainly consists of 5dπ orbital of rhenium, and the LUMO of CH3OH in TS1 mainly consists of σ* orbital of OH bond. As the LUMO is antibonding between the CH3O and H groups, the charge transfer (CT) from HOMO to LUMO plays an important role in the CH3O–H bond breaking [51]. TS2 is divided into CO2 and [Re] − moieties in the same way (Fig. 3B). 0.159e is transferred from the HOMO of [Re] − to the LUMO of CO2 in CO2 coordination. Similar to that in TS1, the HOMO of [Re] − in TS2 mainly consists of the rhenium 5dπ orbital, and the LUMO of CO2 in TS2 mainly consists of the π*-π* conjugated orbital. Based on the CDA analysis, the molecular orbitals of reactive species involved in CO2/H+ reduction are explored to gain deep insight into the mechanism. For CO2 reduction, the LUMO of CO2 could compatibly interact with the HOMO of [Re]− to promote electrons transfer from [Re]− to CO2 and the ReCO2 bond formation. For H+ reduction, the LUMO of CH3OH interacts with the HOMO of [Re]− and the H ligand connecting with O atom in CH3OH has a significant contribution. However, the energy gap between LUMO of CH3OH and HOMO of [Re]− was calculated to be 3.00 eV, which is obviously larger than that between LUMO of CO2 and HOMO of [Re]− (E =1.08 eV). Therefore, we presume that the lower energy-demanding TS for CO2 coordination should be partly attributed to the lower energy gap. 3.3 CO release and catalyst regeneration The mechanism analysis after CO2 coordination under the external applied potential is outlined in Fig. 4 . The catalytic cycle is initiated by CO2 binding to the metal center Re of active catalyst [Re]− , subsequently, [Re-CO2]− would accept H+ to produce more stable intermediate Re-COOH. The ΔG value for protonation process ([Re-CO2]− → Re-COOH) is −43.4 kcal/mol (Fig. 4). After protonation step, it is reasonable to keep Re − COOH bond maintained because removing COOH− from Re-COOH to form [Re]+ is thermodynamically uphill by 54.1 kcal/mol, thus the dissociative mechanism of Re-COOH is unlikely (decarboxylation pathway, blue line in Fig. 4). Moreover, according to previous studies, species such as [Re(bpy-R)(CO)3(COOH)] is known to be isolable and relatively stable in solution, however, it would decompose over the course of minutes to hours to form species such as [Re(bpy-R)(CO)4]+ and further reaction products [48,52]. Thus, once Re-COOH is formed, it would be further protonated to form [Re-CO]+ and H2O with the C−O bond cleavage (protonation-first pathway, red line in Fig. 4). The protonation step occurs via the transition state TS3 to form [Re-CO]+ requiring a moderate ΔG≠ value of 23.9 kcal/mol and having a downhill ΔG value of −21.0 kcal/mol (red line in Fig. 4). The downhill ΔG is probably resulted from entropic gaining by H2O release (red line in Fig. 4) [53]. Alternatively, the analogical complex [Re(bpy-R)(CO)3(CO2H)] was considered to undergo one-electron reduction to form [Re(bpy-R)(CO)3(CO2H)]− [48,52]. Therefore, the reduction-first pathway, where [Re-COOH]− is firstly generated by one-electron reduction of Re-COOH should also be considered (black line in Fig. 4). The ΔG value of this step is 3.7 kcal/mol. As expected, removing COOH− directly from [Re-COOH]− to form Re causes high thermodynamic energy penalty (about 42.7 kcal/mol) making it unlikely to decompose [Re-COOH]− by dissociative mechanism. The DFT calculations by Nganga indicate that the CO ligand stays bound resulting in [Re(diimine)(CO)4] upon one electron reduction of [Re(diimine)(CO)4]+ [29]. Thus the formed [Re-CO]+ would be further reduced to Re-CO at −0.67 V vs. SHE with ΔG value of −4.2 kcal/mol (red line in Fig. 4). In addition, the protonated dehydroxylation of [Re-COOH]− could also occur via the transition state TS4 to produce Re-CO with ΔG≠ value of 21.6 kcal/mol and ΔG value of −28.9 kcal/mol (black line in Fig. 4). As described above, from Re-COOH to Re-CO, there are two possible pathways by reduction-first (Re-COOH → [Re-COOH]− → Re-CO) or protonation-first pathway (Re-COOH → [Re-CO]+ → Re-CO). Both pathways result in CO bond cleavage to generate neutral five-coordinated intermediate Re-CO as well as the release of one H2O [44]. In our study, the protonation-first pathway is proposed to be preferred route due to the slightly lower energy barrier (23.9 kcal/mol) than that of reduction-first pathway (25.3 kcal/mol) at −0.86 V vs. SHE. The studies on electrocatalysis of [Re(bpy-tBu)(CO)4](OTf) using cyclic voltammograms (CVs) confirmed that the reduction of tetracarbonyl complex makes the labilization of a carbonyl ligand [54]. In our calculations, removing CO ligand directly from Re-CO to form Re requires ΔG value of 15.2 kcal/mol, which is thermodynamically unfavored (blue line in Fig. 5 ). Thus, further reduction of Re-CO resulting in CO dissociation is necessary. Two cases from Re-CO to release CO and regenerate active catalyst [Re]− are investigated under the external applied potential: (1) stepwise mechanism, (2) synergetic mechanism. In case (1), the ΔG value of reduction and decarbonylation steps are 38.2 and −13.4 kcal/mol, respectively (red line in Fig. 5). In case (2), the formation of [Re] − from Re-CO by reduction and decarbonylation synergetic process is endothermic of 24.8 kcal/mol (black line in Fig. 5). Based on the calculation results, the [Re]− is more stable than [Re-CO]− . In addition, the reduction potential of the case (2) is about 0.58 V less negative than the case (1). Thus, it seems that Re-CO would decompose to active catalyst [Re]− and CO via reduction and decarbonylation synergetic mechanism. The overall process is slightly exothermal of 9.8 kcal/mol at −0.86 V vs. SHE (Figure S2). And a mechanistic summary depicting overall reaction free energy and their dependencies on applied electrode potential is shown in Figure S3 [48]. The overall process is endothermic at the applied potential of 0 V vs. SHE. Once potentials become more negative than approximately −0.93 V vs. SHE, there is a crossover point where the 5 → TS3 →7 → 8 pathway is not preferred, the 5 → 6 → TS4 → 8 pathway is energetically favored, and once potentials become more negative than approximately −1.99 V vs. SHE, the electrochemical energetics of each intermediate is sequentially downhill in energy. 3.4 Charge analysis In order to gain an insight into the role of gpy-bpy ligand in CO2 reduction, the representative adsorption step [Re] − → [Re-CO2] − and two reduction steps [Re-CO] + → Re-CO, Re-CO → [Re-CO] − are selected to study by the mulliken populations of the intermediates as a rough metric [44] and shown in Figure S4. The active catalyst [Re] − has a partly reduced gpy-bpy ligand carrying negative charge of 0.90 electrons and another partly reduced Re(CO)3 unit carrying extra 0.10 electrons. Upon CO2 coordination with [Re] − to form [Re-CO2] −, the gpy-bpy ligand loses 0.92 electrons in which 0.16 electrons are transferred to Re(CO)3 unit, 0.76 electrons are transferred to CO2 ligand. This electron transfer enables Re to form a σ bond with the carbon of the CO2 ligand [44]. For the reduction reaction [Re-CO] + → Re-CO, 0.92 electrons are transferred to gpy-bpy ligand, and a small contribution to Re(CO)3(CO) unit (0.08 electrons) (Figure S4). Therefore, it can be seen that this reduction is primarily based on gpy-bpy ligand. Moreover, the similar case can be found for one electron reduction of Re-CO, in which 0.93 electrons are transferred to gpy-bpy ligand (Figure S4). The analyses on mulliken charges suggest that the added one electron to the complexes does not directly reduce the ligand L (−CO2, or –CO) or metal Re, but rather stores in the gpy-bpy ligand. Association with initial two-electron reduction of Re-Cl mentioned above, it can be seen that the gpy-bpy ligand exhibits a redox capability in overall process. 3.5 The most favorable catalytic cycle From the previous studies, a shorter bridging C−C bond (between the two pyridine moieties of the bpy ligand) (1.40–1.42 Å) in Re(bpy-tBu)(CO)3(L) and Mn(bpy-tBu)(CO)3Br indicates that the bpy ligand is reduced by a single electron and the bpy π* orbital is occupied, whereas a longer C−C bond distance (1.46–1.48 Å) indicates that the bpy ligand is not reduced [48,55,56]. Based on the above analysis, the most favorable catalytic cycle of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction and structural parameters for corresponding reaction intermediates are presented in Fig. 6 . Originally, CO2 coordination with active catalyst [Re]− occurs via the transition state TS2 to form [Re-CO2]− , in which the C atom of CO2 ligand coordinates with the Re center. Upon CO2 binding to the active catalyst [Re]−, the C3=OA (C3=OB) bond is elongated from 1.17 Å in an isolated CO2 molecule to 1.20 Å in TS2, weakening both C=OA(OB) double bonds, suggesting that the Re−C3 bond forming is in progress. In addition, the bridging C1−C2 bond is elongated from 1.39 Å in the active catalyst [Re] − to 1.43 Å in [Re-CO2]− , indicating the electrons could be transferred from the gpy-bpy ligand. The ΔG≠ and ΔG values of this step are 5.8 and 3.9 kcal/mol, respectively. The next step is the [Re-CO2] − protonation to form Re-COOH, resulting in that C3=OA distance is shortened to 1.22 Å and the C3=OB bond is elongated to 1.39 Å in Re-COOH from 1.24 Å in [Re-CO2] −, respectively. Thus C3=OA bond is strengthened while C3=OB double bond is further weakened and changed into C3−OB single bond. Additionally, the Re − C3 bond is shortened from 2.44 Å in [Re-CO2] − to 2.21 Å in Re-COOH, indicating that the metal center Re binds more firmly to COOH ligand than the CO2 ligand. The ΔG value of this reaction step is −43.4 kcal/mol. Proceeding through the protonation-first pathway shown in Fig. 6, starting from Re-COOH, the protonated dehydroxylation step is occurred via the transition state TS3 to afford [Re-CO]+ and H2O. The OC−H and C3−OB distances in TS3 increase from 0.97 Å to 1.31 Å in CH3OH and 1.39 Å to 2.11 Å in Re-COOH, respectively, suggesting that the H − OB bond is formed and C3−OB bond is weakened. The ΔG≠ and ΔG values of this reaction step are 23.9 and −21.0 kcal/mol, respectively. Then [Re-CO]+ is reduced to Re-CO. In this step, C3=OA bond is not changed, however, the bridging C1 − C2 bond is shortened from 1.45 Å in [Re-CO]+ to 1.40 Å in Re-CO, showing that gpy-bpy ligand is primarily reduced. Finally, Re-CO is reduced to regenerate active catalyst [Re]− as well as the CO release. 4 Conclusions We have elucidated the mechanism of the proton-dependent two-electron pathway for CO2 reduction to CO by Re-Cl. The initial two electrons for reducing Re-Cl reside in the gpy-bpy ligand. The resulting active catalyst [Re]− coordinates with CO2, followed by two consecutive protonation to form [Re-CO] +, the second protonation with CH3OH promotes Brønsted-acid-catalyzed C − OH bond cleavage. The smaller energy gap between the HOMO of [Re]− moiety and the LUMO of CO2 moiety (1.08 eV) than that between the HOMO of [Re]− moiety and the LUMO of CH3OH (H+ source) moiety (3.00 eV) is presumed to be the possible reason for the low energy-demanding TS for CO2 reduction (5.8 kcal/mol) than H+ reduction (34.0 kcal/mol) by CDA, which rationalizes the catalyst selectivity towards CO2 over H+. From Re-COOH to Re-CO, the protonated dehydroxylation step is preferred to occur by protonation-first pathway. The gpy-bpy ligand can be regarded as “charging gpy-bpy ligand” as it plays a “electron reservoir” role and exhibits a redox capability in CO2RR. It is expected that the present study would provide a good understanding and guidance of the observed experiments as well as catalyst design for CO2RR.

        "dc:description": "A complete mechanism for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO by nanographene − rhenium complex (Re(gpy-bpy)(CO)3Cl, gpy = nanographene connected with pyrazine; bpy = 2,2’-bipyridyl) was investigated by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The reaction free energies, reaction barrier heights, charge decomposition analysis (CDA), spin densities and mulliken populations provide deep insight into the reaction mechanism as well as the origin of selectivity for this catalyst. Protonation and then reduction of Re(gpy-bpy)(CO)3COOH (Re-COOH) precedes Brønsted-acid-catalyzed C − OH bond cleavage and then CO release at external applied potential. It is expected that the present work would provide valuable information for designing catalyst.",
