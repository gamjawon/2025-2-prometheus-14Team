Their catalytic performance for CO hydrogenation in a fixed bed reactor was tested with the conditions of 553 K, 5.0 MPa, and H 2 :CO = 2 (molar ratio). With the FeP x /SiO 2 catalysts (x denotes the molar ratio of P to metal), the product was a mixture of oxygenates containing methanol as the major component. With the NiP x /SiO 2 samples, the liquid product was mainly methanol. The Fe 2 P, F e 3 P, Ni, Ni 2 P, N i 3 P, a nd N i 12 P 5 phases were stable during CO hydrogenation, while most of the metallic Fe phase transformed into iron carbide. Key words: carbon monoxide hydrogenation; oxygenates; metal phosphides; silica; iron phosphide; nickel phosphide Concerns about diminishing non-renewable petroleum re- sources, global climate change, and the energy crisis have increased interest in alternative fuel development, especially in biomass conversion. Biomass can be converted into bio-ethanol by an enzymatic process [1]. At present, ethanol is produced on the large scale primarily via the fermentation of sugars derived from corn or sugar cane, or via the hydration of petroleum-based ethylene. The ethylene hydration route suffers from the problem of rising crude oil prices and dependence on oil imports. The production of fuel-grade ethanol from fer- mentation is unattractive because of energy intensive distilla- tion steps. Therefore, a more flexible approach using biomass and coal gas gasification to syngas (CO, CO 2 , and H 2 ) followed by the catalytic conversion of the syngas to ethanol and other oxygenated products can be the route to solve the crisis in the near future [1]. Many catalysts reported for the conversion of syngas to oxygenated hydrocarbon products, such as Rh-based catalysts [2ï€­4], alkali-doped Cu-based catalysts [5,6], modified Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis catalysts [7ï€­9], and Mo-based catalysts [10ï€­12], are limited by poor selectivity. Rh-based catalysts have the highest ethanol selectivity among the cata- lysts investigated [2ï€­4]. However, the issues of cost and supply mean that it would be difficult to commercialize for large scale processes. Therefore, there is significant interest in developing alternative catalysts for selective ethanol synthesis from syn- gas. Recently, transition metal phosphides [13ï€­18] were tested in a series of hydrogenation reactions. Supported phosphides can be easily prepared by the temperature-programmed reduction of phosphate precursors. Some researchers [13ï€­18] have sug- gested that the phosphide catalysts possessed catalytic proper- ties similar to precious metals, and they can also resist sulphur poisoning. The ligand effect and ensemble effect after the insertion of P atoms into the lattice of the metal can change the electronic properties and adsorption properties of the metal [13,14]. These characteristics could endowed the phosphides with the properties for a potential application in syngas con- version. Zaman et al. [19ï€­21] reported syngas conversion over MoP/SiO 2 catalysts and showed that this type of catalyst gave SONG Xiangen et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1938â€“1944 reduced selectivities to hydrocarbons and increased selectivi- ties to oxygenated products. Based on the catalytic results from Mo phosphides [19ï€­21] for syngas conversion and iron group metal phosphides for hydrogenation, we have studied the catalytic properties of iron and nickel metal phosphides for syngas conversion. FeP x /SiO 2 and NiP x /SiO 2 catalysts with different molar ratios of P to metal were prepared and charac- terized using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), CO temperature-programmed de- sorption (CO-TPD), and chemisorptions techniques. 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation of catalysts The catalysts with different molar ratios of P to metal were prepared by a TPR method from supported phosphate precur- sors prepared by the incipient impregnation of the silica sup- port. The silica support was calcined at 773 K for 3 h prior to use. To avoid the formation of an insoluble precipitate of the metal phosphate on mixing the aqueous solutions of metal nitrate and ammonium phosphate, a two-step impregnation was used to prepare the supported metal phosphate precursors. First, the silica support was impregnated with an aqueous solution of (NH 4 ) 2 HPO 4 . After drying at 393 K for 8 h, the support con- taining phosphorus was impregnated with the solution of metal nitrate. The impregnated supports were then dried at 393 K for 8 h and calcined at 773 K for 4 h. Second, the precursors were reduced to phosphides by heating from room temperature to 623 K at a ramping rate of 5 K/min and from 623 to 973 K at a ramping rate of 1 K/min. The samples were held at 973 K for 2 h in flowing H 2 with a flow rate of 350 ml/min per gram of precursor. The catalysts were cooled to room temperature in a H 2 flow and then passivated in a 1% O 2 /Ar flow with a flow rate of 100 ml/min for 4 h. The catalysts with different molar ratios of P to metal were denoted as MP x /SiO 2 (x = P/M molar ratio). The metal mass loading of all catalysts was 10% while the P loading varied. 1.2 Characterization of the catalysts TPR experiments were performed on a Micromeritics Autochem 2910 apparatus. The metal phosphate precursor (80 mg) was calcined at 773 K for 4 h and then placed in a quartz reactor and reduced by a 10% H 2 /Ar gas mixture at a flow rate of 50 ml/min. The temperature increased at 10 K/min to the final temperature and hydrogen consumption was recorded by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A mass spectrometer (QMS, Balzers OmniStar 300) was used to monitor desorbed species. MS signals at m/z = 2 (H 2 ), 18 (H 2 O), and 34 (PH 3 ) were continuously recorded. The CO uptake was measured using the same apparatus as used for H 2 -TPR. The sample (100 mg) was loaded into the reactor and reduced in a H 2 flow with a flow rate of 60 ml/min at 773 K for 2 h. Then, the sample was flushed at 773 K with He at a flow rate of 80 ml/min for 2 h. Subsequently, the sample was cooled to 323 K. The gas (5% CO-He) was injected into a He carrier gas with a flow rate of 50 ml/min. CO uptake was measured using a TCD. CO pulses were repeatedly injected until the areas of consecutive effluent pulses were constant. The total CO uptake was then calculated. After CO adsorption, the sample was swept with a He flow (20 ml/min) until the TCD signal was stable. CO-TPD was performed in the He flow (20 ml/min) at a heating rate of 10 K/min with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS, Balzers OmniStar 300) as detector to monitor the desorbed species. MS signals at m/z = 2 (H 2 ), 16 (CH 4 ), 18 (H 2 O), 28 (CO), 44 (CO 2 ), and 12 (C) were con- tinuously recorded. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was used to calculate the specific surface area. Pore size distributions were determined from the desorption branch of the isotherms using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were recorded with a PANalytical Xâ€™Pert-Pro powder X-ray diffractometer using Cu K ï�¡ radiation (Î» = 0.15418 nm), operated at 40 kV and 150 mA. Both the fresh and spent catalysts used in the XRD measure- ments were first passivated. 1.3 Activity studies The catalyst was pre-treated in the fixed bed reactor as de- scribed in the TPR section. After cooling to 553 K in H 2 flow, the gas was switched to syngas (H 2 :CO = 2) and the reaction was carried out at 553 K, 5.0 MPa, and GHSV = 5000 h ï€­1 . Supported pure metal catalysts of iron and nickel were also tested for comparison. The volume of catalyst loaded was 1 ml. The reaction system consisted of a small fixed bed tubular reactor made of 316 L stainless steel with 300 mm length and 9.0 mm inner diameter with an external heating system. The catalyst particles (20ï€­40 mesh) were placed on a packed bed of quartz sand inside the reactor and the space above the catalyst was also filled with quartz sand that acted as a pre-heater for the syngas. The effluent was passed through a condenser filled with cold and de-ionized water (283 K) to collect the liquid products. The outlet gases CO, H 2 , CH 4 , CO 2 , and other C 1 ï€­C 5 hydrocarbons were analyzed online by an Agilent 3000A Mi- cro GC with four packed columns (molecule sieve, PLOT Q, Al 2 O 3 , and OV-1) and TCD detectors. The liquid organic products and the aqueous products were analyzed offline on a Varian 3800 GC with an HP-FFAP capillary column and a FID detector after they were carefully separated. CO conversion and product selectivity were calculated by the equations of conversion = (âˆ‘(n i Ã— M i )/M CO ) Ã—100% and selectivity = (n i Ã— M i /âˆ‘(n i Ã— M i )) Ã— 100%, where n i is the number of carbon atoms in product i, M i is the total mole number of product i, and M CO is the total mole number of carbon monoxide in the feed. SONG Xiangen et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1938â€“1944 2 Results and discussion 2.1 H 2 -TPR results To study the interaction between the metal component and phosphorus, H 2 -TPR was carried out from room temperature to 1100 K. The H 2 -TPR profiles of the catalyst precursors are shown in Fig. 1. The catalyst precursors of the FeP x /SiO 2 samples after calcination were mixtures of iron oxide and iron phosphate, so, the TPR curves of the sample were the over- lapped result of iron oxide and iron phosphate. Three reduction stages for silica supported iron oxide that corresponded to (1) Fe 2 O 3 to Fe 3 O 4 at 650 K, (2) Fe 3 O 4 to FeO at 750 K, and (3) FeO to Fe at 870 K were reported by many researchers [22,23]. The reported TPR profiles of the iron phosphate also showed three reduction peaks. The first peak was due to the formation of Fe 3 (P 2 O 7 ) 2 from FePO 4 . The second peak was ascribed to the formation of Fe 2 P 2 O 7 . The third peak represented the reduction of Fe and P species, probably to the elemental state [24,25]. Iron phosphate was the main component on the calcined pre- cursor of the FeP 1/2 /SiO 2 sample. The reduction of this sample should be similar to that of iron phosphate. Therefore, the three peaks in the profile of the FeP 1/2 /SiO 2 sample was attributed to the three reduction stages of iron phosphate. In the case of the FeP 1/4 /SiO 2 and FeP 1/8 /SiO 2 samples, iron oxide was the major component on the calcined precursors. The first peak of these two samples at ~660 K was the overlapped reduction from Fe 2 O 3 to Fe 3 O 4 and from FePO 4 to Fe 3 (P 2 O 7 ) 2 . The peaks at 758 and 870 K corresponded to the reduction from Fe 3 O 4 to FeO and FeO to Fe, respectively. The last peak represented the formation of phosphides. For precursors with lower P contents, the TPR profiles showed more shoulder peaks, giving a more complicated overall reduction pattern. In fact, the amount of P was not sufficient to form Fe 3 P and Fe 2 P crystal phases for all the Fe in the cases of the precursors with lower P contents. Consequently, excess iron species would be transformed into metallic Fe before the reduction of phosphorus oxide, which would in turn assist the reduction of the other components by H 2 spillover [26,27]. The final peak at about 940 K shifted a little towards lower temperatures as the P loading decreased. This suggested that the assisting effect of reduced metallic Fe on the reduction of phosphorus species was weak. The H 2 -TPR profiles of the NiP x /SiO 2 catalyst precursors are shown in Fig. 1(b). The first peak at 610 K was ascribed to the reduction of nickel species. The higher temperature peak at 850ï€­925 K was ascribed to the reduction of the Pï€­O bond [17,28,29]. This may be caused by the formation of phosphides species. It can be observed from Fig. 1(b) that the reduction of the Pï€­O bond in the precursors became easier with the decrease of the P content because its peak temperature on the NiP 1/8 /SiO 2 catalyst was decreased by 75 K compared with that of the NiP 1/2 /SiO 2 catalyst. This was attributed to the effect of the active atomic hydrogen species from the dissociation of H 2 on metallic Ni formed earlier during the reduction [26,27]. This indicated that the interaction between the Ni and phosphorus species was stronger than those of the Fe samples. During the TPR, the mass spectrometer did not detect any PH 3 signal. 2.2 XRD characterization The diffraction patterns of the fresh and spent FeP x /SiO 2 catalysts are presented in Fig. 2(a). In the case of the FeP 1/2 /SiO 2 sample, an almost pure Fe 2 P phase was obtained in the fresh catalyst. There was a small amount of the Fe 3 P phase, which may be from a small loss of P during calcination. No obvious difference was observed between the pattern of the spent FeP 1/2 /SiO 2 catalyst and the fresh one. This indicated that the Fe 2 P and Fe 3 P phases were stable under the syngas at- mosphere. Three crystal phases of metallic Fe, Fe 2 P, and Fe 3 P were present in the fresh FeP 1/4 /SiO 2 catalyst. It was interesting to find that most of the metallic Fe phase transformed into iron carbide (Fe 5 C 2 ), which is the active phase in F-T synthesis [30,31], while the Fe 2 P and Fe 3 P phases remained intact after CO hydrogenation just as in the FeP 1/2 /SiO 2 sample. It appeared that the transformation of the metallic Fe phase had no impact on the Fe 2 P and Fe 3 P phases. The changes in the XRD patterns between the fresh and the spent catalysts for FeP 1/8 /SiO 2 were similar to those of the FeP 1/4 /SiO 2 sample. The difference was that the metallic Fe peak in the fresh catalyst became more intense and the Fe 3 P phase was the main phosphide component. The diffraction patterns of the fresh and spent NiP x /SiO 2 catalysts are presented in Fig. 2(b). In the patterns of the NiP x /SiO 2 catalysts, the nickel phosphide phases became 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 685 673 FeP 1/2 /SiO 2 FeP 1/4 /SiO 2 H 2 c o n s u m p t i o n FeP 1/8 /SiO 2 940 654 816 870 758 (a) T/K H 2 c o n s u m p t i o n NiP 1/8 /SiO 2 NiP 1/4 /SiO 2 NiP 1/2 /SiO 2 610 850 925 (b) Fig. 1.

SONG Xiangen et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1938â€“1944 complicated because different nickel phosphide phases with different molar ratios of P to Ni were formed. In the case of the NiP 1/2 /SiO 2 catalyst prepared from oxidic precursors with P:Ni = 1:2, the main phases on the fresh catalyst were Ni 2 P and Ni 12 P 5 . The possible reason for this was that P was lost during calcination and reduction. This phenomenon of two nickel phosphide phases was also observed by Sawhil et al. [15] whose nickel phosphide was also prepared from a NiP x /SiO 2 precursor with a molar ratio P:Ni = 1:2. The peak at 47 o was a little broader because this peak is the result of the overlap of two peaks. One was a minor peak attributed to Ni 2 P located at 47.4 o and another was also a minor peak belonged to Ni 12 P 5 at 46.9 o . It was found that the metallic Ni phase appeared in the fresh catalyst, while the Ni 2 P and Ni 12 P 5 phases became the Ni 3 P phase when the molar ratio of P to Ni was increased to 1:4 and 1:8. The XRD patterns of the spent nickel samples were unchanged from those of the corresponding fresh samples, which implied that the metallic Ni, Ni 2 P, Ni 3 P, and Ni 12 P 5 phases were stable during the CO hydrogenation reaction. No other peaks associated with phosphorous species except for the phosphides appeared in the XRD patterns. 2.3 Textural properties and chemisorption of CO N 2 adsorption was used to measure the surface area, pore diameter, and pore volume of the catalysts. CO chemisorption capacities were also measured. The results are listed in Table 1. In comparison with the support, the fresh catalysts possessed lower specific areas and smaller average pore diameters, which was presumably due to pore blockage by the phosphides. The surface areas of the catalysts became smaller with increasing P content. CO uptake was small for pure fresh phosphide cata- lysts with a P:metal ratio of 1:2 in all cases. The enhanced CO uptake with the increase of the P:metal ratio can be attributed to adsorption on metallic active sites. The high calcination and reduction temperatures can induce a strong interaction between the support and the metal, which would weaken the CO ad- sorption capacity of the catalyst [32,33]. 2.4 CO-TPD results Figure 3(a) displays the TPD spectra of CO adsorbed on the FeP x /SiO 2 catalysts.

The mass spec- trum of the corresponding products during the CO-TPD over the FeP 1/4 /SiO 2 catalyst is also shown in Fig. 3(b). In Fig. 3(a), two desorption peaks can be observed. The peak at the low temperature of 366 K was due to weakly adsorbed CO. The other peak at 859 K was attributed to strongly adsorbed CO on reduced metal particles. Figure 3(b) showed that the signals of CO 2 and C were detected during CO desorption at high tem- perature. This showed that the reaction of CO disproportiona- tion (2CO â†’ CO 2 + C) took place during CO-TPD at 859 K. With the decrease of P to Fe molar ratio, the low and high desorption peak temperatures did not shift, and only the peak area of the high temperature peak increased. This suggested that the formation of phosphides induced the CO adsorption capacity decrease at the high temperature. XRD analysis showed that the metallic Fe was transformed into iron carbide during the reaction. Therefore, the CO-TPD profiles over the fresh catalysts may only partially reflect the interaction be- tween adsorbed CO and active sites. Figure 4(a) displays the TPD spectra of CO adsorbed on the NiP x /SiO 2 catalysts. The mass spectrum of the corresponding products during CO-TPD over the NiP 1/4 /SiO 2 catalyst is also shown in Fig. 4(b). The desorption profiles of the NiP x /SiO 2 catalysts were similar to those of the FeP x /SiO 2 catalysts. The peak at 372 K was due to weakly adsorbed CO, and the peak at 722 K cor- responded to strongly adsorbed CO. Judging from the simul- taneous appearance of CO 2 during CO desorption at about 736 K in mass spectrum of the NiP 1/4 /SiO 2 catalyst, the reaction of CO disproportionation also took place. With the decrease of the P:Ni molar ratio, the high temperature desorption peak was shifted noticeably from 722 to 756 K. This indicated that the introduction of P changed the electronic structure and weak- ened the adsorption of nickel. The weakening of the interaction between CO and nickel may enhance the selectivity for oxy- genates in the product. 2.5 Catalytic performance Table 2 presents the detailed reaction data from CO hydro- genation over the different phosphide catalysts. The supported pure iron metal catalyst produced mainly hydrocarbons. CO conversion and hydrocarbon selectivity increased with the decrease of the P:metal ratio, while the selectivity for oxygen- ates had an opposite trend. For the catalysts with the same ratio of metal to P, the CO conversion on the iron phosphide was a Table 2 CO hydrogenation over the FeP x /SiO 2 and NiP x /SiO 2 catalysts Selectivity (%) Catalyst a CO conversion (%) CH 4 C 2-5 H b C 5+ H c MeOH EtOH Other C 2+ oxy d CO 2 FeP 1/2 /SiO 2 2.0 25.1 12.5 2.0 30.1 7.4 15.1 7.8 FeP 1/4 /SiO 2 6.5 29.4 15.4 5.0 19.4 9.9 10.2 10.7 FeP 1/8 /SiO 2 11.5 33.1 15.4 10.1 10.6 9.8 5.7 15.3 Fe/SiO 2 19.2 32.4 22.6 20.2 2.7 2.0 2.0 18.1 NiP 1/2 /SiO 2 1.3 27.1 12.6 0 45.4 6.7 3.1 5.1 NiP 1/4 /SiO 2 2.5 38.5 8.6 0 44.4 4.3 1.2 3.0 NiP 1/8 /SiO 2 4.6 40.4 7.3 0 42.8 4.2 1.3 4.0 Ni/SiO 2 14.5 80.2 5.2 0 2.2 0.9 0.0 11.5 Reaction conditions: T = 553 K, p = 5.0 MPa, H 2 :CO = 2:1, GHSV = 5000 h ï€­1 . a Metal loading of all catalysts was 10 wt%, and phosphorus loadings were different. b Hydrocarbons with two to five carbons. c Hydrocarbons with more than five carbons. d Oxygenates other than ethanol with two to five carbons, such as propanal, propanol, butanol, butyraldehyde, and ethyl acetate. 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 NiP 1/8 /SiO 2 NiP 1/4 /SiO 2 NiP 1/2 /SiO 2 C O d e s o r p t i o n 372 722 756 (a) NiP 1/4 /SiO 2 H 2 ï‚´ 10 H 2 O CH 4 CO ï‚´ 100 CO 2 T/K M S s i g n a l (b) Fig. 4.

SONG Xiangen et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1938â€“1944 little higher than that on the nickel phosphides. The proportion of higher hydrocarbons in the product was also higher than that from the nickel phosphides. This was attributed to the phase transformation of metallic iron to iron carbide, which was shown by the XRD analysis. Iron carbide is very active for the synthesis of higher hydrocarbons from syngas [30,31], so a catalyst containing this phase would give some liquid phase with higher hydrocarbons. For the same ratio of metal to P, the low selectivity to higher hydrocarbons over the nickel phosphides indicated a limited chain growth ability of the nickel phosphide catalysts. On decreasing the P:Fe ratio, the selectivity for methanol decreased rapidly from 30.1% to 10.6%, while those to meth- ane and CO 2 increased slowly from from 25.1% to 33.1% and from 7.8% to 15.3%, respectively. This was because the pro- portion of metallic iron in the catalysts increased with the decrease of the P:Fe ratio, resulting in the enhancement of the CO dissociation ability of the catalysts. It is known that Fe-based catalysts catalyze the water gas shift (WGS) reaction simultaneously during the CO hydrogenation reaction [30]. Our reaction results showed that pure iron phosphide also possessed WGS activity. It is worthwhile to note that the se- lectivity for oxygenates over Fe 2 P reached as high as 50%, although the main product was methanol. This suggested that the Fe 2 P phase was more conducive to the formation of oxy- genates than metallic iron and iron carbide, although hydro- carbons were also produced on it. We have shown in the TPR characterization that the interaction between metallic Fe and reduced P was not very strong. Therefore, the coexistence of iron phosphide and metallic iron in the catalysts would give rise to two kinds of active sites that were mutually independent. The phosphide active site favored the formation of oxygenates and the active sites of metallic iron and iron carbide preferen- tially produced hydrocarbons. From the above observations, we deduced that CO hydrogenation over the FeP 1/4 /SiO 2 and FeP 1/8 /SiO 2 catalysts was an additive result of the actions of these two isolated active sites. On decreasing the P:Ni ratio, the selectivity for methane increased slowly, while the selectivity for methanol showed a small decrease. The main component in the liquid product over the NiP x /SiO 2 catalyst was methanol, which is similar to that of Cu based catalysts [5]. The selectivity for C 2 + oxygenates on this catalyst was relatively low. This was reasonable because metallic Ni possessed only very weak chain growth ability, and it is well known that Ni-based catalysts are good methanation catalysts [34]. The introduction of phosphorus changed the electronic properties of the metallic Ni particles. Thus, CO dissociation ability decreased, which was accompanied by an increase in the nondissociative CO adsorption capacity. Therefore, a large amount of liquid products, with methanol as the main component, was formed during CO hydrogenation over the NiP x /SiO 2 catalysts. 3 Conclusions CO hydrogenation over a series of iron group metal phosphide catalysts was investigated and correlated with the ratio of P to metal. The FeP x /SiO 2 catalysts gave mixed oxy- genates with methanol as the main component. The NiP x /SiO 2 catalysts gave mainly methanol. The Fe 2 P, Fe 3 P, Ni, Ni 2 P, Ni 3 P, and Ni 12 P 5 phases were stable during CO hydrogenation, while most of the metallic Fe phase was transformed into iron carbide. CO hydrogenation over the FeP x /SiO 2 catalysts was an additive result from the two isolated active sites of iron phosphide and iron carbide. The influence of P caused the CO dissociation ability of nickel to decrease, which was accompanied by an increase in the nondissociative CO adsorption capacity. References 1 Subramani V, Gangwal S K.

Tel/Fax: +86-411-84379143 A series of silica supported iron and nickel metal phosphides with different molar ratios of P to metal were synthesized by the temperature programmed reduction method. Their catalytic performance for CO hydrogenation in a fixed bed reactor was tested with the conditions of 553 K, 5.0 MPa, and H2:CO = 2 (molar ratio). With the FeP x /SiO2 catalysts (x denotes the molar ratio of P to metal), the product was a mixture of oxygenates containing methanol as the major component. With the NiP x /SiO2 samples, the liquid product was mainly methanol. The Fe2P, Fe3P, Ni, Ni2P, Ni3P, and Ni12P5 phases were stable during CO hydrogenation, while most of the metallic Fe phase transformed into iron carbide. 摘要 通过程序升温还原法制备了一系列氧化硅负载的不同 P/M (M = Fe 和 Ni) 摩尔比的金属磷化物催化剂, 在 553 K, 5.0 MPa 和 H2:CO = 2 (摩尔比) 的反应条件下用固定床反应器测试了它们催化 CO 加氢反应性能. 结果表明, 在 FeP x /SiO2 (x 为 P/M 摩尔比) 催化剂上, 液相产物是以甲醇为主的低碳含氧化物的混合物. 而在 NiP x /SiO2 催化剂上, 气态产物主要为甲烷, 液相产物绝大多数是甲醇. 表征结果表明, 磷化物催化剂上的 Fe2P, Fe3P, Ni, Ni2P, Ni3P 和 Ni12P5 晶相在反应条件下是稳定的, 没有形成磷化物的金属铁, 在反应后转变成碳化铁晶相.
