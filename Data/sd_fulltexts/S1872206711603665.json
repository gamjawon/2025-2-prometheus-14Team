V. H. D. Central Institute of Home Science, Bangalore-560 001, India Abstract: An environmentally benign method for the synthesis of octahydro-quinazolin-2,5-diones by the reaction of aromatic aldehydes, dimedone, and urea in the presence of SiO 2 -NaHSO 4 is reported. SiO 2 -NaHSO 4 acts as an efficient, mild, and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst to give excellent yields within a short reaction time in water at 6080 ? C. Key words: octahydro-quinazolin-2,5-dione; aromatic aldehyde; dimedone; urea; water Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) are very important for the construction of many heterocyclic compounds [1] and this strategy has been used effectively in the synthesis of many biologically active substances and natural products [2]. The synthesis of octahydro-quinazolin-2,5-diones has attracted the attention of chemists because of their highly potent antibacte- rial activity against many kinds of bacteria including Staphy- lococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aerugi- nosa [3]. Furthermore, they have demonstrated calcium an- tagonist activity [46]. Several methods have been reported for the synthesis of octahydro-quinazolin-2,5-diones from aro- matic aldehydes, dimedone, and urea, involving the use of catalysts such as NH 4 VO 3 [7], TMSCl [8], Nafion-H [9], conc. H 2 SO 4 [10], conc. HCl [11], heteropolyacids [1213], bakers? yeast [14], and ionic liquids [15,16]. They can also be synthe- sized via a Biginelli multicomponent reaction using cyclo- -diketones [17]. Many of the reported methods suffer from one or more disadvantages including harsh reaction con- ditions, long reaction times, poor yields, and the use of haz- ardous and expensive catalysts with limited reusability. Herein, we have attempted to develop a clean and environ- ment friendly approach to the synthesis of octahy- dro-quinazolin-2,5-diones with high yields using SiO 2 -Na- HSO 4 as a catalyst. SiO 2 -NaHSO 4 acts as highly efficient het- erogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of octahydro-quinazolin- 2,5-diones from aromatic aldehydes, dimedone, and urea, providing the product in excellent yields in a water solvent at temperature in the range of 60?80Â°C. The catalyst can be easily recovered and reused several times with good efficiency. 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation of the catalyst SiO 2 -NaHSO 4 catalyst was prepared by the reported method [18]. Silica gel (15 g, 100200 mesh) was added to a mag- netically stirred solution of NaHSO 4 .H 2 O (6.9 g, 50 mmol) in distilled water (100 ml) at 25 Â°C over a 30 min period. The mixture was stirred for a further 30 min allowing for the so- dium bisulfate to adsorb onto the surface of the silica gel. The water was removed in vacuo to give a powder which was dried in an oven at 120 Â°C for 23 h. 1.2 Synthesis of octahydro-quinazolin-2,5-diones All reactions were carried out in a 50 ml RB flask in water. During a general procedure (Scheme 1), a mixture of dimedone (1 mmol), urea (1.2 mmol), SiO 2 -NaHSO 4 (0.1 g), and water Sadeq Hamood Saleh AZZAM et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 677â€“680 (10 ml) was taken in a 50 ml round bottom flask and heated at 6080 Â°C for 30 min. An aromatic aldehyde (1 mmol) was then added and heating was continued with stirring for a period of time. Ethyl acetate (10 ml) was then added and the solid cata- lyst filtered from the mixture, washed with chloroform, and recycled. The filtrate was evaporated to give the crude product which was recrystallized from methanol-water (2:1) to afford the pure product. During the course of the reaction, the product formation was monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis and compared with the authentic samples. Melting points were determined on a RAAGA system (Chennai, India). Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu FT-IR-8400s spectro- photometer from KBr discs. The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded from DMSO-d 6 solvent on 400 and 100 MHz Bruker instruments, respectively.

A literature survey re- vealed that the use of SiO 2 -NaHSO 4 for the synthesis of xan- thenediones [19], -enaminones, and 2-methylquinolin-4(1H)- ones [20]. Furthermore, SiO 2 -NaHSO 4 has been used in the protection of aldehydes with 2-mercaptoethanol [18]. In a continuation of our work into the synthesis of biologically active heterocyclic compounds using readily available, inex- pensive, and environment friendly catalysts [2126], herein we are report the synthesis of octahydro-quinazolin-2,5-diones by the one-pot multi-component reaction of aromatic aldehydes, dimedone, and urea using SiO 2 -NaHSO 4 as an efficient catalyst in water. We have found that SiO 2 -NaHSO 4 catalyzes the reac- tion between aromatic aldehydes, dimedone, and urea in an aqueous medium efficiently to afford the desired products in excellent yield within 12 h. The catalyst can be easily pre- pared [18] and safely handled, making the method more ad- vantageous over other conventional methods and catalysts. The efficiency of SiO 2 -NaHSO 4 as a catalyst for the syn- thesis of the model compound 7,7-dimethyl-4-phenyl-4,6,7,8- tetrahydro-1H,3H-quinazoline-2,5-dione (4a), was compared with that of other catalysts reported in the literature (Table 1). It is clear from this table that SiO 2 -NaHSO 4 is an efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally benign catalyst which could be useful in the synthesis of a series of octahy- dro-quinazolin-2,5-diones. From a practical perspective, the catalyst can be easily prepared from readily available reagents and can also be recycled.

It was found that grinding of the reactants and the catalyst did not afford the product in good yield. Similarly, heating the materials neat on a hot-plate at 120 Â°C provided only a moderate increase in yield, whereas, stirring in water at 6080 Â°C was found to be ideal for the present reaction. In a typical experiment, dimedone, urea, SiO 2 -NaHSO 4 , and water were taken in a 50 ml RB flask and the mixture was heated in an oil bath at 6080 Â°C for 30 min. Benzaldehyde was then added and the heating was continued with stirring until 4a was obtained in maximum yield (typically 1.5 h for a 95% yield). In order to illustrate the versatility of the present method, a variety of aromatic aldehydes were treated with dimedone and urea. The results of the study are presented in Table 2. The products obtained were characterized by spectral and elemental analysis. The possibility of recycling the catalyst was then examined. After completion of the reaction (1.5 h), ethyl acetate (10 ml) was added to the reaction mixture and the catalyst was filtered and washed with chloroform, ready for further use. This proc- ess of recycling was completed four times (with washing every time). From Fig. 1 it can be seen that, in the first two runs, the activity remained the same. After two runs, however, the ac- tivity started decreasing, which may be due to the degradation of the catalyst under mechanical stirring and heating. The yields for the four runs were found to be 93%, 91%, 85%, and 75%, respectively. 2.2 Mechanism A plausible mechanism for the formation of 7,7-dimethyl-4- aryl-4,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1H,3H-quinazoline-2,5-dione is pre- sented in Scheme 2. The activation of dimedone may take place by the protonation of one of the oxygens by the catalyst.

Intermediate (II) may then attack the activated aldehyde forming intermediate (III), which may undergo cyclization through an internal nucleophilic attack to form 7,7-dimethyl- 4-aryl-4,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1H,3H-quinazoline-2,5-dione, as shown in the scheme (Scheme 2). 3 Conclusions SiO 2 -NaHSO 4 is a heterogeneous, easy to prepare, inexpen- sive, and efficiently catalyst for the synthesis of octahy- dro-quinazolin-2,5-diones. The advantages offered by this method include simple reaction condition, short reaction time, involvement of an environment friendly procedure, ease of product isolation, excellent yields, and reusability of the cata- lyst. To the best of our knowledge, this method is the first reported procedure for the synthesis of tetrahydro-1H,3H- quinazoline-2,5-dione molecules using a heterogeneous recy- clable catalyst.

Tel: +91-80-22961337; Fax: +91-80-22961331 An environmentally benign method for the synthesis of octahydro-quinazolin-2,5-diones by the reaction of aromatic aldehydes, dimedone, and urea in the presence of SiO2-NaHSO4 is reported. SiO2-NaHSO4 acts as an efficient, mild, and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst to give excellent yields within a short reaction time in water at 60-80 °C. Graphical abstract A rapid and environmentally benign method for the synthesis of octahydro-quinazolin-2,5-diones by the reaction of aromatic aldehydes, dimedone, and urea in the presence of SiO2-NaHSO4 is reported. SiO2-NaHSO4 acts as an efficient, mild, and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst to give excellent yield of the products within a short reaction time in water at 60-80 oC.
