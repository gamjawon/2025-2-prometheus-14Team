Keywords Propylene carbonate Propylene oxide Carbon dioxide Ruthenium complex 1 Introduction Since the petroleum resources are limited, there is a growing effort to develop new chemical processes using biorenewable resources. One such resource of particular interest is carbon dioxide that is a nontoxic, nonflammable and naturally abundant C1 feedstock. However, the thermodynamic stability of carbon dioxide has hampered its use as a reagent for chemical synthesis. To overcome this limitation, great efforts have been made in investigating reactions to activate carbon dioxide as a highly reactive reagent [1,2]. One of the effective routes is the coupling of carbon dioxide with epoxides to synthesize cyclic carbonates, such as ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate, which are valuable compounds as aprotic polar solvents, electrolytes in secondary batteries, fine chemical intermediates, and starting materials for the synthesis of polymers and engineering plastics. Various catalysts have been found effective for this coupling reaction, such as alkali metal halides, organic bases, metal oxides, zeolite, polymer supported quaternary ammonium salt, ionic liquids, and metal complexes, etc. [3–19]. Although the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from carbon dioxide and epoxides has been known for over 50 years and a great number of works in effective catalyst investigation have been reported, catalytic activity still remain to be improved in getting a higher efficiency [3–5]. Recently, Lu et al. reported the coupling reaction of CO2 with propylene oxide (PO) to produce optically active propylene carbonate (PC) under mild conditions using a chiral catalyst, SalenCo(III)/n-Bu4NCl with a turnover frequency (TOF, moles of PC produced per mole of catalyst per hour) of 316h−1 [12]. Kim et al. found that the complex [(2-methylpyridine)2ZnBr2] catalyzes the reaction of CO2 with PO to give PC in a yield of 80% with a TOF of 405h−1, while the complex [(2,2′-bipyridine)2ZnBr2] showed no catalytic activity [13,14]. Man et al. recently reported that a heterobimetallic Ru–Mn complex, [(η5-C5H5)Ru(CO)(μ-dppm)Mn(CO)4], catalyzes the reaction of PO with CO2 to give PC at 100°C and 4.0MPa of CO2 with a turnover number (TON, moles of PC produced per mole of catalyst) of 1490 and a TOF of 37h−1 [15]. Srivastava et al. found that a composition of Cu(bipy)2(NO3)2(H2O) with 4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) catalyzes the reaction of CO2 with PO at 120°C and 0.69MPa of CO2 to give PC with a TON of 772 and a TOF of 193h−1 [16]. The present paper reports our recent findings in the investigation for highly efficient catalysts for the reactions of carbon dioxide with epoxides. We found that a ruthenium bipyridine complex, [(2,2′-bipy)RuCl3(CH3OH)], exhibits very high catalytic activity together with an ammonium salt, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), for the formation of propylene carbonate from carbon dioxide and propylene oxide (Scheme 1 ). This catalyst gave propylene carbonate with nearly 100% selectivity and 100% yield at a temperature of 75°C under 3.0MPa of CO2, and the catalyst can be reused several times without appreciable loss of catalytic activity and selectivity. 2 Experiments Propylene oxide was distilled over CaH2 prior to use. Carbon dioxide of 99.99% purity was used as received. (2,2′-bipy)RuCl3(CH3OH) was prepared following a literature procedure [20]. CTAC and other reagents with chemical purity were obtained and used as received. 1H NMR spectrum was recorded on a Bruker DPX-400 spectrometer. IR spectrum was measured on a Nicolet Protégé 460 infrared spectrophotometer. The coupling reaction of carbon dioxide with propylene oxide was carried out in a 100ml stainless steel autoclave equipped with a magnetic stirrer. For a typical reaction process, the catalyst was charged into the reactor, followed by addition of a desired amount of purified propylene oxide using a syringe. Then, the reactor was pressurized to 1.0–4.0MPa with carbon dioxide and heated to a desired temperature (50–90°C) with stirring. After 2–6h of reaction, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, and the reaction mixture was transferred to a round bottom flask. The product propylene carbonate was obtained as a colorless liquid through distillation under reduced pressure. IR spectrum (neat) showed a typical carbonyl absorption at 1793cm−1, and 1H NMR (CDCl3, TMS, 400MHz) showed signals at 1.50(d, J=6.24, 3H, CH 3), 4.04(t, J=7.82, 1H, CH 2CH), 4.56(t, J=8.02, 1H, CH 2CH), and 4.82–4.92(m, CH). For the catalyst recycle process, after the propylene carbonate was removed by distillation, the remaining catalyst was reused for further reaction with a fresh charge of propylene oxide and carbon dioxide through the same procedures as those in the initial reaction described above. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Optimizing reaction conditions Since the complex of (2,2′-bipy)RuCl3(CH3OH) and CTAC are easily dissolved in a mixture of propylene oxide and propylene carbonate, the coupling reaction of carbon dioxide with propylene oxide catalyzed by [(2,2′-bipy)RuCl3(CH3OH)/CTAC] does not require an organic co-solvent, and the reaction proceeds in a homogeneous manner. The molar ratio of CTAC to (2,2′-bipy)RuCl3(CH3OH) was found to be a major factor for the catalytic activity. As shown in Table 1 , the individual ruthenium complex (2,2′-bipy)RuCl3(CH3OH) or CTAC showed no catalytic activity. However, the combination of (2,2′-bipy)RuCl3(CH3OH) with CTAC exhibited a significantly high catalytic activity. The yield of propylene carbonate increases with increasing molar ratio of CTAC to (2,2′-bipy)RuCl3(CH3OH) in the range between 0 and 1; a further increase in the molar ratio of CTAC gave almost no change in the catalytic activity. Therefore, the suitable molar ratio of CTAC to (2,2′-bipy)RuCl3(CH3OH) is 1. The selectivity, which is defined as the molar percentage of PC formed over PO converted, was found nearly 100% in each entry of experiment. 1H NMR spectroscopy showed that no polymer was formed in any entry of experiment. Other factors influencing the coupling reaction are given in Table 2 . At reaction temperature of 75°C and CO2 pressure of 3.0MPa, the reaction proceeded rapidly within the first 3h, and the PC yield increased with increasing reaction time. It is important to note that an almost quantitative yield could be achieved in 4h of reaction time. In other words, a reaction time of 4h is necessary to complete the propylene oxide conversion. Reaction temperature gave also an obvious influence on the reaction. Although a moderate PC yield of 65% was obtained even at a lower temperature of 50°C under CO2 pressure of 3.0MPa within 4h of reaction time, the PC yield increased with increasing reaction temperature and an almost quantitative yield could be achieved at 75°C. Therefore, increasing the reaction temperature is propitious for the increase in reaction rate. The reactant mixture consists of both the CO2-rich gas phase and the liquid phase. The intervention of CO2–PO complex has been deduced on the basis of appearance of a new absorption band in the UV spectrum of the saturated solution of CO2 in PO [21]. Hence, carbon dioxide should be soluble in PO, and most of the reaction occurs in the liquid phase. The density and the concentration of PO in the gas phase increase with the temperature increase and the pressure decrease, while the volume of the liquid phase rapidly decreases; the concentration of CO2 in the liquid phase would be enhanced by increasing the pressure. Probably, this would cause the increase in the PC yield observed with the increase in pressure. But the reaction does not need a higher carbon dioxide pressure; under CO2 pressure of 1.0MPa, 82% of PC yield was obtained at 75°C within 4h of reaction time. The yield increased as the pressure of CO2 increased from 1.0MPa to 3.0MPa; even higher CO2 pressure was not necessary for the present reaction studied. Therefore, we may consider that the optimal conditions for the reaction of carbon dioxide with propylene oxide yielding propylene carbonate catalyzed by [(2,2′-bipy)RuCl3(CH3OH)/CTAC] should be 75°C of reaction temperature, 3.0MPa of CO2 pressure, 4h of reaction time, and the molar ratio of (2,2′-bipy)RuCl3(CH3OH) to CTAC should be 1. As can be seen from Table 3 , the results presented above gives higher values of TON and TOF under mild conditions compared with most reported transition metal complex catalysts to date [11–19] for the reaction of CO2 with PO. Moreover, the present catalyst [(2,2′-bipy)RuCl3(CH3OH)/CTAC] has the advantages of being simple in composition, stable in air and easy to be prepared, which is beneficial for industrial application. 3.2 Catalyst recovery and reuse It is well known that the stability and reusability of a catalyst are two important factors that determine whether it finds practical application in industry. In order to test this characteristic of the present catalyst, a series of catalytic cycles for the coupling reaction of carbon dioxide with propylene oxide was carried out under the optimized reaction conditions. After each run, all volatiles including propylene carbonate and unreacted propylene oxide were distilled off from the reaction mixture, and the remaining catalyst was reused for the succeeding run directly. The results are listed in Table 4 , which showed that the catalyst did not present any appreciable loss in either the catalytic activity or the selectivity. After five catalytic recycles, the total TON reached 2.04×104 with a TOF higher than 1000h−1. 3.3 Possible mechanism It has been proposed that the coupling of carbon dioxide with epoxides to yield cyclic carbonates probably requires the activation through both a Lewis acid and a Lewis base; the former activates the epoxide, while the latter attacks the less sterically hindered carbon atom to open the epoxide ring. The generated oxy anion species then reacts with CO2 to give the corresponding cyclic carbonate [4,6,7,12]. The structure of the complex [(2,2′-bipy)RuCl3(CH3OH)] has been determined by X-ray diffraction as reported by Eskelinen, in which the ruthenium centre is surrounded by a slightly distorted octahedral coordination environment by three chloride ligands, the bidentate chelating 2,2′-bipyridine ligand and the methanol ligand. The methanol ligand is labile and can be replaced by other neutral ligands [20]. The first crystal structure of a metal epoxide complex has been reported for a ruthenium porphyrin derivative of styrene oxide [22]. The insertion of CO2 into the metal-oxygen bond to form a metal carbonate species is well established [14,23]. Based on the molecular structure of the complex [(2,2′-bipy)RuCl3(CH3OH)] and coupling reaction results, we propose here a possible mechanism for the coupling reaction of propylene oxide and carbon dioxide (Scheme 2 ). The reaction is initiated by the ligand exchange of propylene oxide with methanol to form an adduct of ruthenium–epoxide complex (1), which is readily ring-opened by the nucleophilic attack of the highly reactive anions of quaternary ammonium salt; then, a quaternary ammonium salt [CTAC, (CH3)3(C16H33)N+Cl−] attacks the less hindered carbon atom of the coordinated epoxide followed by ring opening, producing an oxy anion species (3). The insertion of CO2 into the Ru–O bond of (3) would give a ruthenium carbonate active species (4), which eventually produces propylene carbonate by way of intramolecular cyclic elimination. In the present reaction studied, the complex of (2,2′-bipy)RuCl3(CH3OH) should be able to form an adduct of Ru-PO complex (1), but its ability to open the PO ring is not high enough. The addition of a Lewis base (CTAC) is necessary, which performs an important role in facilitating the ring-opened intermediate (3). The cooperation of (2,2′-bipy)RuCl3(CH3OH) with CTAC leads to a very efficient catalysis. This point is strongly supported by the observation that in the absence of a Lewis base, the complex of (2,2′-bipy)RuCl3(CH3OH) itself is inactive for the coupling reaction of CO2 and PO. Meanwhile, the fact that an equimolar ratio of CTAC to (2,2′-bipy)RuCl3(CH3OH) is appropriate for the reaction can be well explained by the catalytic mechanism proposed above. 4 Conclusion A variety of metal-based catalysts have been found active for the coupling of carbon dioxide with epoxides; however, few have exhibited the success based on a ruthenium complex. The combination of (2,2′-bipy)RuCl3(CH3OH) with an ammonium salt CTAC exhibits a very high activity and selectivity for the formation of propylene carbonate from carbon dioxide and propylene oxide under mild conditions. TOF higher than 1000h−1 could be achieved generally and even TOF as high as 1512h−1 can be achieved at a shorter reaction time. The catalyst can be easily recovered and reused several times without appreciable loss of catalytic activity. After five catalytic recycles, the total TON reached up to 2.04×104.
