Graphical abstract Two new porphyrin@MOFs type catalysts, CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF, have been synthesized through “one-pot” self-assembly approach, which are permanently porous and exhibit catalytic activity for the oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol. Reaction of 1,1-bis-[3,5-bis(carboxy) phenoxy]methane (H4L) and CuCl2 in the presence of meso-tetrakis[4-(nicotinoyloxy)phenyl]porphyrin (TNPP) and manganese complex of TNPP (MnTNPP), respectively, under solvothermal condition afforded CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF, microporous metal-organic materials containing neutral CuTNPP or MnTNPP molecules in their frameworks. The nitrogen sorption isotherm measurement, ultraviolet visible adsorption spectroscopy (UV–vis), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) characterizations showed that CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF were permanently porous and had heterogeneous catalytic activity for the oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol. Keywords Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) Metalloporphyrins Heterogeneous catalysis Encapsulation 1 Introduction Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have received much attention as catalytic materials in addition to their applications in gas storage and separation due to their unique features, including their crystallinity, porous structure, huge specific surface area, and the high density of open metal sites in the framework [1,2]. A key to construction advanced MOF materials for catalysis applications is to integrate active sites or species into MOFs framework. There are different strategies to achieve MOF functionalization, such as the use of a functionalized ligand [3] and the encapsulation of functional species into the cavities of MOFs through non-covalently interaction [4–6], but the preparation of MOFs with predictable properties is still a challenge because the functionalization process depends on many factors, including reaction conditions and stability of the MOFs. Metalloporphyrins have proven to be efficient and selective catalysts for the oxidation of organic substrates [7–9]. Nevertheless many homogeneous metalloporphyrin-based catalysts suffer from limited lifetime activity due to the self-aggregation of active sites and oxidative self-degradation [10]. Therefore, immobilization or encapsulation of metalloporphyrins in porous solid matrices provides a promising strategy to overcome such drawbacks [11,12], where the porphyrin ring can be isolated and its catalytic site protected. MOFs that have permanent channels and cavities have been taken for unearthly catalyst supports [1]. There are several strategies to build porphyrin-containing MOF catalyst, such as using functional porphyrin molecules as organic linkers [13–18]. It has also been demonstrated that cationic porphyrins can be encapsulated into the cavities of a zeolite-like MOF [19] or HKUST-1 [20–22] using a “one-pot” self-assembly approach. Our previously published pcu-MOF has several attributes as catalyst host matrix, such as high surface area, a hierarchy of pore sizes and large cages [23]. There are three different types of open cages in the overall framework of pcu-MOF. The largest cage has a nanoscale rectangle open window (10.57Å×10.67Å) with a diameter of 27.85Å along the diagonal (centroid–centroid distance of the paddlewheels) that matches well to the calculated size of meso-tetrakis[4-(nicotinoyloxy)phenyl] porphyrin (23.7Å×27.0Å, Fig. S1), a functional neutral porphyrin molecule, denoted as TNPP [24]. Here we reported the synthesis of new porphyrin@MOFs type catalysts (Fig. 1 ), CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF, by reaction of a flexible ligand, 1,1-bis-[3,5-bis(carboxy) phenoxy]methane (H4L), and CuCl2 in the presence of TNPP and MnTNPP, respectively, under solvothermal condition. Both CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF can improve the oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol with H2O2 at ambient condition. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation CuTNPP@MOF was prepared according to the approach we reported previously in the presence of TNPP [23]. In a typical reaction a mixture of H4L (76mg, 0.2mmol), CuCl2·2H2O (68.2mg, 0.4mmol) and TNPP (6.6mg, 0.006mmol) was dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF, 20mL). The received mixture was divided into four parts (about 5mL) in Tefon-liner 25-ml Parr pressure vessels, then deionized water (1.5ml) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (45μl, 37wt%) were added to each vessel. The Teflon liners were placed in autoclaves, and heated to 358K for 120h, resulting dark red block crystals (yield: 55% based on H4L). In the process of MnTNPP@MOF preparation, only TNPP was changed to MnTNPP (6.9mg, 0.006mmol). 2.2 Catalyst characterization The images of pcu-MOF, CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF were taken by using an optical microscope (BX51, Olympus, Japan). Elemental analyses (C, H and N) were performed on a Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer. The contents of copper in pcu-MOF, CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF were determined by using an IRIS Intrepid ER/S (Thermo Elemental) inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). UV–vis spectra were recorded by using UV-2450 spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on an EXTAR6000 TG/DTA6300 instrument under nitrogen atmosphere (200mL/min). The sample was heated at a constant rate of 10K/min from 303 to 873K. Powder X-ray diffraction was performed on a Bruker D8 Advance using Cu-Kα radiation (λ =1.5406Å) at room temperature with a scan speed of 0.5s per step and a step size of 0.02°. The total surface area of the catalysts was measured by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method using nitrogen adsorption at 77K. The nitrogen sorption isotherm measurements on pcu-MOF, CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF were performed at 77K and 0–760Torr on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were performed on Hitachi S 4300 and JEOL-2010 at room temperature. 2.3 Catalytic tests The catalytic activities of CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF were evaluated by using 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol (DTBC) oxidation as a probe reaction. In a typical reaction, 2mg of CuTNPP@MOF, MnTNPP@MOF or pcu-MOF, or 0.2mg CuTNPP, MnTNPP or CuMeOTPP, was added to a solution containing 0.1mmol of DTBC and 20μl H2O2 (30wt%) in 5ml methanol. Reactions were conducted at room temperature for 10h and monitored by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Shimadzu LC-10AT) with an ultraviolet detector. The analytical column was a Shim-Pack VP-ODS chromatographic column (250mm×4.6mm, 5μL). The mobile phase was consisted of water and acetonitrile (V/V=3/7). The flow rate was 1mlmin−1, and the detection wavelength was 220nm. For the experiments under anaerobic condition and using gas oxygen as oxidant, nitrogen and oxygen were introduced into the reaction system with a flow rate of 20ml/min instead of air and H2O2, respectively, keeping the other conditions unchanged. 3 Results and discussion The images showed that the crystals of pcu-MOF, CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF were of cubic shape (Fig. 2 ). The crystal sizes of three samples were in the range of 50–300μm. The dark red color of CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF, noticeably different from that of pcu-MOF, indicated the presence of the porphyrin. Predictably, compared with the pore size (Fig. S1), the CuTNPP or MnTNPP molecule should reside in the largest cage in pcu-MOF framework, but it was difficult to verify the inclusion of the porphyrin molecules by single-crystal XRD due to the lower symmetry and disorder of the guest molecules. The contents of CuTNPP or MnTNPP in CuTNPP@MOF or MnTNPP@MOF, calculated according to the data of ICP-AES and elemental analysis, were 9.8% and 8.3%, respectively (Tables S1–S3), which was much lower than the ideal value (24.4%) when every large pore in pcu-MOF was occupied by one porphyrin molecule, indicating that more than half of the largest cages were empty. The nitrogen physisorption measurements demonstrated the porosity and stability of CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF after removing the included and coordinated solvents. As expected, the specific surface areas and pore volumes of CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF, comparing with that of the pure host material, decreased noticeably (Table 1 , Fig. S2). The surface area of CuTNPP@MOF (681m2/g) is about one-third that of the pcu-MOF (2010m2/g) before guest molecule incorporation. The total pore volume decreases by 61% with respect to pure pcu-MOF, which is more than the porphyrin weight loading of 9.8%. The surface area and pore volume of MnTNPP@MOF have not decreased so much due to the relatively low loading of porphyrin molecule (8.3%). These data clearly show that CuTNPP and MnTNPP molecules are encapsulated into the porous framework of pcu-MOF and thus reduce the pore volume by preventing the N2 from entering the cavities. Similar phenomena were also reported for metal nanoparticle and polyoxometalate functionalized MOF materials [6,25]. The changes of the pore size distributions, calculated from analysis of the N2 isotherms of CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF at 77K using Horvath–Kawazoe method, also confirm the inclusion of the porphyrin molecule in MOF cavity (Fig. S3). The adsorption spectroscopy studies reveal that the spectrum of CuTNPP@MOF in DMF exhibits a Soret band at ∼420nm, and two weak Q-bands at 540nm and a shoulder band on it at 580nm (Fig. S4). The two Q-bands, different from the four Q-bands of free porphyrin, indicate that the free TNPP was metalated synchronously during the self-assembly process. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF samples match well to the data of pcu-MOF (Fig. 3 and Fig. S6), confirming the construction of the intended crystalline framework. According to TGA curves (Figs. S7 and S8), CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF are stable up to a temperature of 573K, similar to the data of pcu-MOF [23]. As CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF contained catalytically active metalloporphyrin species and its backbone remained intact after activation, we were encouraged to evaluate the catalytic abilities of CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF. Polyphenols are routinely used to evaluate the peroxidase activity of porphyrin catalysts [26], so the oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol (DTBC) was chosen as a probe reaction (Scheme 1 ). The oxidation of DTBC using H2O2 as the oxidant (Scheme 1) was studied in methanol, which was chosen as the solvent because of the solubility of both reactants (DTBC and hydrogen peroxide) in this medium. The DTBC conversions over the pcu-MOF, CuTNPP, MnTNPP, CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF were shown in Fig. 4 . It was seen that CuTNPP@MOF exhibited a higher activity than that of CuTNPP and pure MOF. These experimental results also indicate that CuTNPP molecules and the open metal sites within the MOF are both efficient for the DTBC oxidation reaction. It was reported that the oxidation product, 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-quinone (DTBQ), could be further oxidized to lactone or dicarboxylic acid by hydrogen peroxide in acidic system [27], but no other oxidation products except DTBQ were detected in our experiments (Figs. S9 and S10). The maximum conversion of DTBC was not too high (∼60%), indicating that the catalytic activity of the catalyst decreased as the increase of reaction time. One possible reason is that partial product molecules adsorbed on the surface of catalyst particles or in the channel of MOF framework that might block the active sites and adsorption sites in the crystal lattice [28,29]. The catalytic activity of CuTNPP@MOF did not decrease obviously in reuse cycle after fully washed with methanol (Fig. 4b), implying that the adsorbed compounds could be removed by washing with solvent. A large number of dinuclear and mononuclear copper complexes have been reported as functional mimics for catechol oxidases [30–36], but the copper-based porphyrins were rarely used [37,38]. The conversions of DTBC in the presence of MnTNPP under similar condition were the same low as blank at most desired times, moreover, the catalytic activity of MnTNPP@MOF was not enhanced by the incorporation of metalloporphyrin, comparing with pcu-MOF. These results indicated that MnTNPP was catalytically inactive for the DTBC oxidation, in contrast to the reported manganese porphyrins [35,39]. At every desired time within the first 2h, the DTBC conversions over CuTNPP@MOF increased rapidly as the increase of reaction time, which were higher by 1.2–1.7-fold than the sums of that of CuTNPP and pcu-MOF (Tables S4 and S5), suggesting the existence of a weak synergistic effect between the two structural components of CuTNPP@MOF[6]. The reasonable explanation for the enhanced reaction rate was that the encapsulation of metalloporphyrin molecule in MOF cages improved the catalytic conversion efficiency of porphyrin molecule significantly, where its drawbacks of aggregation and oxidative self-degradation in homogeneous systems were overcomed [11]. After that the pcu-MOF and CuTNPP were still less efficient than CuTNPP@MOF, but the difference between the activity of CuTNPP@MOF and pcu-MOF decreased. This change in catalytic activity between CuTNPP@MOF and pcu-MOF can be attributed to the decrease of the contribution of CuTNPP for the DTBC oxidation due to the adsorption of partial product molecules on the surface or in the channel of MOF that prevent the substrate molecules access to the metalloporphyrin. Moreover, in order to exclude the co-catalytic contribution of the nicotinoyl groups in CuTNPP molecule, additional experiments were run for DTBC oxidation in the presence of copper meso-tetrakis[4-(methoxyl)phenyl]porphyrin (CuMeOTPP). The DTBC transformation under similar condition was comparable to that of CuTNPP (Fig. S11), thereby proving that the catalytic activity of CuTNPP was provided only by the center copper ion and not by any nicotinoyl group on the periphery of porphyrin ring. For determining the active oxygen species in the reaction, experiments using H2O2 as oxidant under anaerobic condition and using gas oxygen as oxidant were performed, respectively. It was found that the DTBC transformation under anaerobic condition was similar to that of the general oxidation experiment stated in Section 2.3 without the nitrogen protection, but the control experiment treating DTBC with oxygen in the presence of CuTNPP@MOF resulted in negligible conversion (Fig. S12), indicating that no activation of molecular oxygen occurred in the system. This means that CuTNPP@MOF is different from the reported binuclear copper complexes that show catecholase activity, in which the organic ligands have flexibility and two copper ions are in close proximity [40]. These experimental results implied that H2O2 played an important role in DTBC oxidation. When the oxidation reactions were performed in dimethyl sulfoxide and tert-butanol, two commonly used hydroxyl radical quenchers [41,42], respectively, remarkable decreases were found in the conversions of DTBC (Fig. 4a), indicating that hydroxyl radicals were possible reactive species responsible for the oxidation of DTBC. A possible mechanism of the formation of OH involves the interaction between H2O2 molecules and the open metal sites in the MOF framework and in the center of metalloporphyrin molecules [43]. In order to further understand the contribution of the two structural components of CuTNPP@MOF to the catalytic activity, the corresponding turn over numbers (TON) of CuTNPP and pcu-MOF based on DTBC consumed in the same catalytic experiments and copper sites present in them at every desired time were calculated (Table S6). The TONs of CuTNPP and pcu-MOF after 10h are 193 and 7, respectively, indicating that the metal center of CuTNPP molecule is much higher efficient than the open copper site within the MOF for the DTBC oxidation reaction. However it is still difficult to calculate exactly the TON of CuTNPP in CuTNPP@MOF according to the experimental data, mainly due to the complicated processes analysis involving both MOF catalyzed reaction and reactant/product diffusion. The solid porphyrin@MOF catalysts could be readily separated from the reaction solution by filtration, meanwhile its dark red color remained with no porphyrin species found in the reaction solution. The nitrogen physisorption measurement (Fig. S13) and SEM images (Fig. S14) demonstrated the porosity and stability of the CuTNPP@MOF sample after four catalysis cycles. The main diffraction peaks of the CuTNPP@MOF sample after reaction also matched to the data of fresh catalyst (Fig. 3). Few diffraction peaks becoming broaden can be attributed to the degradation of partial crystal particles induced by the stirring and the effect of reaction medium. 4 Conclusions In summary, two new porphyrin@MOFs type catalysts have been synthesized through “one-pot” self-assembly approach. The resulting CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF solids were permanently porous, and exhibited catalytic activity for the oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol to o-quinone by hydrogen peroxide. It is of interest that CuTNPP and pcu-MOF were both efficient for the DTBC oxidation reaction, nevertheless MnTNPP was catalytically inactive, resulting the discrepancy between the catalytic activities of CuTNPP@MOF and MnTNPP@MOF. The copper center of the encapsulated CuTNPP molecule and the open copper sites within the MOF are the active sites in catechol oxidation.
