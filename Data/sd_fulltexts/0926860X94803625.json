After drying and reduction these catalysts were additionally treated with carbon monoxide or CO/HZ at 250. Due to this treatment the catalyst's carbon monoxide chemisorption capacity significantly increased compared to normal reduction. At the same time the intrinsic reactivity for carbon monoxide dissociation is enhanced. These effects are attributed to the structural changes of the catalysts. A model, based on TPR, XPS, IR and TEM measurements, is proposed. The carbon monoxide treatment results in a catalyst that is better reducible and has larger metal ensembles. Keywords: Carbon monoxide chemisorption; IR; Ruthenium; TPR; TEM; XPS 1. Introduction Ruthenium catalysts posses activity for many reactions. They are well known catalysts in the Fischer-Tropsch reaction due to the high activity for carbon monoxide dissociation and carbon-carbon bond formation. Ruthenium also has a high activity for hydrogenolysis [ 1-4], isomerization [ 1,5], selective hydrogenation [ 6,7 ] , steam reforming [ 8 ] and ammonia synthesis [ 9,10 ] . Ruthenium catalysts are expensive and therefore controllable preparation of highly dispersed catalysts is of importance. Different approaches have been used to prepare ruthenium catalysts, such as ion exchange [ 11,12] and precipitation techniques. Most commonly an impregnation technique is used.

Koerts et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 315-326 precursors and solvents have been used to this end: Ru (NH3) 6C13 [ 12,13 ] , Ru (acac) 3 [ 1,12,14 ] , ruthenium carbonyls inorganic solvents [ 7,15 ] Ru3 (CO )12 in CHC13 [16,17], H4Ru(CO)12 or H2Ru(CO)1$ in hexane [18] and Ru (NO) (N03) 3 [ 3,19 ] . One of the cheapest and most commonly used precursors is an aqueous solution of RuC13 - xH20 [ 15,20-23 ] . Very important in heterogeneous catalysis is the pretreating procedure of the catalyst before using it, because it partly determines the catalytic performance. Therefore knowledge about structural changes during drying, calcination and reduction is of great interest. Ruthenium catalysts, used in reactions with reductive conditions, are often pretreated with hydrogen. In this study we will analyse the influence of an additional carbon monoxide pretreatment on the catalytic activity and structure of a Ru/Si02 catalyst. The different stages of the catalyst after drying, reduction with hydrogen reduction with carbon monoxide, have been characterized with the Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), infra-red spectroscopy (IR) and X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS). From these combined measurements a model is proposed that correlates the carbon monoxide treatment with structural changes of the catalyst system. 2. Experimental A 5 wt.-% ruthenium catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of preshaped silica (Grace 332: 300 m2/g, pore volume= 1.65 ml/g, mesh size 75-125) with an aqueous solution of ruthenium(III) chloride (Drijfhout, Amsterdam) to which a little nitric acid was added to increase the solubility (pH = 1-2). The catalyst was dried overnight at 110 (sample A). Subsequently a part of the catalyst was reduced in 1 bar of H2 at 450 raising the temperature with 5/min. After reduction the catalyst was passivated in nitrogen by pulsing oxygen at room temperature (sample B). A part of this catalyst was reduced again and treated in a synthesis gas flow of 15 ml/min (H2/CO=2) at 250 for 30-45 min. After this treatment the catalyst was reduced at 450 to remove all surface carbon species, and passivated (sample C). TPR experiments were carried out with 25 mg catalyst in a flow of 4% H2 in argon. The temperature was raised with 5/min to 450. The reactivity of adsorbed carbon monoxide was tested using temperature-programmed surface reaction spectroscopy (TPSR). This technique has been used before [ 24,25 ] and is described in detail in a previous publication [ 26 ]. Carbon monoxide adsorbed at room temperature was hydrogenated in a flow of 20 ml/ min of 8% hydrogen in helium, while the temperature was raised with 10/min. Carbon monoxide desorption as well as methane formation were measured continually with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (PGA 100 from Leybold) as a function of the hydrogenation temperature. T. Koerts et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 315-326 317 The metal particle size was studied with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a Jeol, JEM 2000 FX. The effective active surface area was determined by carbon monoxide chemisorption. The carbon monoxide chemisorption capacity was measured at room temperature on 300 mg of the reduced catalyst from a flow of 40 ml/min of 0.5% CO in helium. The amount of carbon monoxide consumed was calculated by integrating a mass spectrometer signal. See ref. [ 26] for a detailed description of this way of accurate carbon monoxide chemisorption capacity measurement (reproducibility within 5%). To obtain information about the extent of carbon monoxide activation IR measurements of adsorbed carbon monoxide were carried out on a Bruker (type 11405 ) in transition mode, using a pressed tablet of 20 mg of the catalyst. Carbon monoxide was adsorbed at room temperature at 20 mbar and subsequently evacuated. XPS spectra were obtained with a VG Escalab 200 spectrometer equipped with an A1 Ka X-ray source and a hemispherical analyzer connected to a five-channel detector. Measurements were done at 20 eV pass energy. Reduced catalysts were unloaded from the reactor in a glove box and transported to the XPS in a nitrogen filled transport vessel. Peak areas were detected with the program VGS, using a Gauss/Lorentz fit routine. 3. Results 3.1. Carbon monoxide chemisorption and TPSR The reduced catalyst (sample B) adsorbed 1.82 ml CO per gram catalyst which corresponds with a CO/Ru ratio of 0.15 mol/mol. For the catalyst that was also treated in a synthesis gas flow at 250 (sample C), these numbers are 4.24 ml and 0.35 mol/mol, respectively. Through the carbon monoxide treatment the chemisorption capacity increased by more than a factor of 2. This was measured several times for three individual prepared 5% Ru/Si02 catalyst batches. The increase in carbon monoxide chemisorption capacity varied from 100 to 200%. This was also observed for a 1% Ru/Si02 catalyst that was prepared according to the same method. The increase in carbon monoxide chemisorption capacity could be achieved both in a CO/He flow as well as in a CO/HZ flow, but not in a flow containing water, or by oxidation reduction cycles. The carbon monoxide chemisorption capacity increase is shown in Fig. 1 as a function of time-on-stream in CO/HZ and CO/He flows. After each carbon monoxide chemisorption in Fig. 1, a temperature-programmed hydrogenation of adsorbed carbon monoxide (TPSR) was carried out in which the formation of methane was measured. As supposed in the work of Takahashi et al. [ 27 ] we assume this to reflect the reactivity of carbon monoxide dissociation under 318 T.

So the rate of methane formation supplies information about the rate of carbon monoxide dissociation. Fig. 2 shows that with increasing time-on-stream in synthesis gas, the TPSR produces more methane. This is due to the fact that more carbon monoxide is adsorbed on the catalyst, as also shown in Fig. l . The fact that the methane formation curves shift to lower temperature with increasing carbon monoxide chemisorption capacity is obvious. This can be correlated with a higher intrinsic reactivity of the catalyst for methane formation. Because carbon monoxide dissociation is the rate limiting step and the hydrogen pressure was the same, we attribute this effect to an increase of the intrinsic reactivity for carbon monoxide dissociation. 3.2. Temperature programmed reduction To analyse the catalysts' reduction behaviour, TPR experiments were carried out ( see Fig. 3 ) . The hydrogen consumption was calibrated on cobalt oxide samples. .

Temperature-programmed reduction of the fresh catalyse the reduced catalyst and the synthesis gas treated catalyst. The technique on the same apparatus is described extensively in refs. [ 28,29 ] . All three samples can be reduced below 200. Only the freshly RuC13 impregnated catalyst (A) shows hydrogen consumption at higher temperature. Therefore the first reduction of the chlorine containing catalyst has to be carried out above 400. The total amount of hydrogen consumed by sample A does not correspond with a total reduction of Ru'IIC13 to Ru but is significantly less, indicating that the catalyst is not fully reduced. Also, the catalyst oxidised at 400 (sample B) does not consume enough hydrogen for a full conversion of Ru02 to Ru. Due to the treatment in synthesis gas, an enhancement of 19% in the amount of consumed hydrogen is observed. The hydrogen consumption of sample C (pretreated in synthesis gas) corresponds to a complete reduction of Ru02 to ruthenium metal within experimental error. Therefore sample B probably contains still some ruthenium ions after reduction with hydrogen. 3.3. Transmission Electron Microscopy The particle size of the catalysts was studied with transmission electron microscopy. The photographs of the impregnated, the reduced and the synthesis gas treated catalyst are shown in Fig. 4. The dried catalyst shows little contrast. There is no clear distinction between the silica and the supported ruthenium phase. After reduction, the metal particles show a much sharper contrast with the silica. The particle distribution was calculated from several pictures (100 particles). When a weighted average is calculated it appears that the metal particles have become somewhat larger due to a treatment in synthesis gas: 2.3 t 0.8 nm for the reduced catalyst and 2.7 nm for the synthesis gas treated catalyst. 320 T.

Koerts et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 11511994) 315-326 321 Icy Fig. 4. (c) Catalyst after treatment in synthesis gas. The IR spectra of carbon monoxide adsorbed on the reduced catalysts show several peaks. The main peak at 2028 cm-' is from linearly adsorbed carbon monoxide, as reported by several authors [ 30-32 ] . At the synthesis gas treated catalyst there is more linearly adsorbed carbon monoxide present (peak at 2038 cm -' ) due to the larger carbon monoxide chemisorption capacity. The position of this peak is dependent on the carbon monoxide coverage due to dipole coupling effects [ 33-35 ] . The slightly lower frequency of the linearly adsorbed carbon monoxide molecules on the reduced catalyst can be attributed to a lower carbon monoxide surface coverage. The peak at 2172 cm-' has not been reported in the literature for this catalyst system. The peak around 2141 cm-' is attributed to socalled twin adsorbed carbon monoxide: two carbon monoxide molecules adsorbed on one ruthenium atom or ion [ 30,36~38 ] . This peak is accompanied by a peak at 2080 cm-'. These peaks are observed on both the reduced and synthesis gas treated catalyst. Yokomizo et al. [39] demonstrated that the peak at 2080 cm-' can also be due to linearly adsorbed carbon monoxide on ruthenium ions (RuZ+). By analysing the intensity ratios of the peaks at 2080 and 2140 one can indicate the presence of such Ru ions. This ratio IzoBO/IZtao is 1.O for the reduced and 0.5 for the synthesis gas treated catalyst. This indicates that on the reduced catalyst this peak is mainly due to linearly adsorbed carbon monoxide on Ru2+ ions. One can not estimate the relative frequency of the Ru2+ surface species on the basis of the IR data, due to differences in extinction coefficients and carbon monoxide adsorption strength. As a result of the carbon monoxide treatment, the peak at 2080 cm-' largely disappears. We take this as evidence that the ruthenium surface ions have disap- 322 T.

Also the relative intensity of the dicarbonyls ( at 2140 cm-' ) has decreased, which also indicates the disappearance of positively charged ruthenium species. Thus, similar to the TPR experiments, IR measurements indicate that after reduction at 450, unreduced ruthenium species are present in this catalyst system. The fresh, reduced and synthesis gas treated catalysts were measured by XPS after in situ reduction, with the aim to obtain information on the ruthenium oxidation state, the ratio ruthenium/ silica and the presence of chlorine (see Table 1). A problem of measuring ruthenium catalysts with XPS is that the carbon 1 s signal interferes with the Ru 3d peak. We have not been able to separate these signals reliably. Instead we use the Ru 3p peak which, although too broad for obtaining chemical information, is suitable for studying dispersion effects.

Koerts et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 315-326 323 The XPS results show that the chlorine has fully disappeared after reduction at 450. The intensity of the ruthenium peak decreases due to the synthesis gas treatment indicating a loss of dispersion. 4. Discussion The important result from this study is that a silica-supported ruthenium catalyst increases its carbon monoxide chemisorption capacity due to pretreatment in carbon monoxide at 250 with at least 100%. At the same time the catalysts' intrinsic reactivity for methane formation from adsorbed carbon monoxide in the presence of hydrogen, is increased. Characterization by TPR, TEM, IR and XPS indicates that the increased carbon monoxide adsorption capacity is accompanied by a better reducibility and a slight increase in size of the ruthenium particles. Mizushima et al. [40] reported that carbon monoxide adsorption can induce a rupture of Ru-Ru bonds due to the formation of twin carbonyls. It is also known that at elevated temperatures ruthenium carbonyls become mobile in the gas phase [ 41 ] . Especially on silica supported catalyst this can play a role due to the relatively weak metal-support interaction. Due to this mobility a redispersed catalyst could possibly be formed. However, we do not believe that transport of ruthenium via carbonyls plays a role in our study. Mobile ruthenium species are expected to result in a loss of ruthenium, but we have not detected any ruthenium loss with PIXE measurements. Also ruthenium deposition downstream after the catalyst bed could not be observed. Therefore we conclude that ruthenium carbonyl formation is slow under the conditions applied and can not be held responsible for the structural changes observed. The information on particle size after the different catalyst pretreatments is summarized in Table 2. The TEM and XPS data show that, although the chemisorption capacity has increased by a factor of two, the particle size has decreased. This trend in the TEM and XPS data is the same but the absolute dispersion differ quit much. The dispersion calculated from the TEM measurement is remarkably high. This might be caused by the presence of a RuSiOx layer that is invisible for TEM, or to the presence of a few large ruthenium particles that are not taken into account.

Koerts et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 315-326 The slight increase of the ruthenium particle size, as shown by the TEM data, might be due to the fact that the reduced ruthenium is better visible than the ruthenium-silica interface. It is also possible that strongly adsorbed ruthenium atoms or very small particles, which can not be reduced by hydrogen, can migrate upon the carbon monoxide treatment to the larger metal particles. This results in a larger reducible ruthenium fraction with larger ruthenium metal ensembles. This gives an explanation for the enhanced intrinsic reactivity for carbon monoxide methanation. Carbon monoxide dissociation is a structure sensitive reaction, which is favourable on larger metal ensembles [ 43 ] . It is not clear whether there are silica ions present on the ruthenium metal surface after reduction. Such surface silica ions can suppress the carbon monoxide chemisorption in so called SMS1 systems. A low carbon monoxide surface coverage after carbon monoxide adsorption on catalyst system B is in agreement with the lower frequency observed with IR which can be induced by carbon monoxide dipole coupling. The presence of unreactive blocking silica species on the ruthenium particles might decrease the metal ensemble size, and can therefore explain the lower activity for carbon monoxide methanation. However, the XPS results do not support the presence of surface silica species. A 20% decrease in the Ru/Si XPS signal ratio between sample B and C is observed. The ruthenium chloride solution used for impregnation had a pH of 1-2. During slow drying of the catalyst the concentrations of ions increase. This results in deposition of the metal precursor, but also in a further decrease of the pH. At low pH the silica support is able to dissolve slowly, a process which is enhanced by chloride [44]. This can result after drying in a an undefined RuSiC130., phase, which does not show any crystallinity as indicated with R6ntgen diffraction. Also in the TEM pictures no clear ruthenium particles were visible. Upon reduction in hydrogen at 450 the ruthenium can be partly reduced to Ruand all the chloride is removed, as proven with XPS. A particular part of the ruthenium remains as ions and is not fully reduced as appeared from the TPR and IR data. The XPS data demonstrate that no chloride is present after the reduction at 450. Therefore the remaining ruthenium ions are not due to residual chloride, which disagrees with Narita et al. [45] who found residual chloride on silica supported ruthenium catalysts after reduction. Therefore the ruthenium ions are most likely due to a strong interaction between ruthenium and the silica. Such a Ru-Si02 interaction has been described by Lopez et al. [46] who proposed the existence of Ru-O-Si bonds. At the ruthenium-silica interface this may result in difficult to reduce ruthenium species, a problem also known for silica supported iron [ 47 ] and cobalt [ 48 ] catalyst systems. Apparently the carbon monoxide treatment at 250 is able to reduce this interaction and to create fully reduced ruthenium. This implies that carbon monoxide reduction at 250 is more effective than hydrogen reduction at 450. We have tried to summarize the information in a model describing the various stages of the catalyst (see Fig. 6) . It is the most simple model that is consisted with the observations. T. Koerts et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 315-326 325 RuSiOCI RUSIO pu jAI CO Si02 450 250 Fig. 6. Model for the different stages of the catalysts after drying (A), after reduction (B) and after carbon monoxide treatment (C). The main features of this interpretation are that the acid preparation resulted in a ruthenium catalyst with a silica-ruthenium interface that is difficult to reduce with hydrogen. Carbon monoxide is able to reduce this interface at a relative low temperature because of its strong reducing effect. Larger metal surface ensembles are formed enhancing the catalyst reactivity for carbon monoxide dissociation. 5. Conclusion Due to the acidic impregnation of the silica with ruthenium chloride a catalyst is created that can not be completely reduced with hydrogen at 450. Carbon monoxide pretreatment at 250 results in a fully reducible ruthenium catalyst. This carbon monoxide treated catalyst has a larger active surface area with larger metal ensembles, which posses a higher activity for carbon monoxide dissociation. References [ 1 ] J.H.

After drying and reduction these catalysts were additionally treated with carbon monoxide or CO/H2 at 250°C. Due to this treatment the catalyst's carbon monoxide chemisorption capacity significantly increased compared to normal reduction. At the same time the intrinsic reactivity for carbon monoxide dissociation is enhanced. These effects are attributed to the structural changes of the catalysts. A model, based on TPR, XPS, IR and TEM measurements, is proposed. The carbon monoxide treatment results in a catalyst that is better reducible and has larger metal ensembles.
