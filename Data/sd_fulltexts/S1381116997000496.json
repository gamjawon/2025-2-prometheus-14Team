Masai Department of Chemical Science and Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Kobe University, Rokkodai, Nada, Kobe 657, Japan Received 23 August 1995; accepted 21 February 1997 Abstract Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes, crotonaldehyde (CH3CH=CHCH=O) and cinnamaldehyde (C6HSCH=CHCH=O), has been studied over S'02 -Supported monometallic Sn and bimetallic Rh-Sn catalysts in the liquid phase. Over a silica-supported monometallic Rh catalyst, Rh/Si02, no unsaturated alcohol (crotyl alcohol or cinnamyl alcohol) was formed, whereas considerable amounts of the corresponding saturated aldehyde and saturated alcohol were obtained. The selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol was improved over the Rh-Sn bimetallic catalyst. The selectivity to the corresponding unsaturated alcohol attained ca. 65% over the Rh-Sn bimetallic catalysts. On the other hand, The supported Sn catalyst showed markedly high selectivity to the unsaturated alcohols. The selectivity of the Sn/SiO,, attained 95% to crotyl alcohol and 100% to cinnamyl alcohol, respectively. Although the conversion of each unsaturated aldehyde over Rh-Sn/Si02 catalysts was greater than that over Sn/Si02 catalysts, the selectivity of Sn/Si02 catalysts to the corresponding unsaturated alcohols was superior to that over Rh-Sn/SiOZ. The selectivity of Sn/Si02 was also compared with that of Rh-Sn/S'02 at a similar conversion of the unsaturated aldehydes. The selectivity of Sn/Si02 was significantly greater than that of the Rh-Sn bimetallic catalyst. These results indicate that the high selectivity over Sn/Si02 was ascribed not to low conversion but to intrinsic selectivity of the Sn catalyst.

Introduction Selective hydrogenation of functional groups in unsaturated compounds is important for the chemical industry as well as academic interest. Recently, a number of papers have been reported in the field of selective hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds [1-8]. Especially, a combination between group VIII hydrogenation components and cationic base metals has been Corresponding author. 1381-1169/97/$17.00 Copyright 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. P11 S1381-1169(97)00049-6 extensively studied for the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and esters. The bimetallic systems, (Pt, Rh, Ru)-(Sn, Fe, Mn), which were supported on silica, alumina, or active carbon, have been investigated for the reactions [3-12]. Metal complex catalysts fixed on polymer chains were used for selective hydrogenations of unsaturated carbonyl compounds [13]. The catalysts which were prepared by using a metal complex as a precursor were also reported [9,10,14,15]. The metal complex precursor brought about the L18 S. Nishiyama et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 120 (1997) L17-L22 high dispersion of metals on a support and a high yield of hydrogenates. The effect of surface structure and additives was also studied on single crystals [16]. Our group has been studying hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes over Rh-Sn bimetallic catalysts [17-19]. Benzaldehyde was hydrogenated to benzyl alcohol over Rh-Sn/Si02, whereas the use of Rh/Si02 led to considerable formation of toluene and benzene [17]. Furthermore, the conversion ratio of benzaldehyde and the life time of the RhSn/Si02 catalyst in flow systems was superior to that of the Rh/Si02 catalyst [17]. The selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol over heterogeneous catalysts has also been studied. Over the Rh/Si02 catalysts, only butyraldehyde (product from -C=C- bond hydrogenation) and 1-butanol (fully hydrogenated product) were formed. Addition of tin to the Rh/Si02 catalyst brought about the formation of crotyl alcohol. Ferreti et al. [ 10] have reported that Rh-Sn bimetallic catalysts were effective for hydrogenolysis of ethyl acetate. RuSn/A1203 catalysts prepared by the sol-gel method were also active for the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids as reported by Toba et al. [ 11 ]. The role of tin in the Rh-Sn bimetallic catalysts was considered to be to control the adsorption intermediate of unsaturated aldehydes [19], and the main active sites were group VIII metals. In this paper, we report on the catalytic behavior of supported tin catalysts without usual active components for hydrogenation reactions. We would like to propose Sn/Si02 as a new catalyst, not reagent, for selective hydrogenation of unsaturated organic compounds. Tin oxide catalysts are usually known to be effective for oxidation reactions. Table 1 Physical properties of Si02 (JRC-SIO-8 a) Surface area (m 2/g) Pore volume (cm3/g) 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Silica support, SIO-8 which is one of the reference catalysts supplied from the Catalysis Society of Japan, was used for Sn/Si02, RhSn/Si02, and Rh/Si02 catalysts. The physical properties of the Si02 are shown in Table 1. A starting material of Sn was hydrated tin chloride (SnC12 ~ 2H20). The Si02 support was impregnated with an ethanolic solution of tin chloride. The loading of Sn was 5 wt% (as a metal) of the support. Rhodium/S'02 and Rh-Sn/Si02 were also prepared by impregnation or co-impregnation. The Si02 support was impregnated with an aqueous solution of Rh(N03)3 or a mixed solution of Rh(N03)3 and SnCl2 ~ 2H20. The loading of Rh was 5 wt% of the support and the Sn/Rh ratio in the Rh-Sn/S'02 catalyst was unity. The obtained catalyst precursors were calcined in a flowing air at 773 K for 6 h followed by reduction in a flowing hydrogen at 573 K for 6 h. 2.2. Hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes Hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde was carried out in a 30 ml autoclave. The reagent grade of crotonaldehyde was obtained from Aldrich Chem. and cinnamaldehyde was purchased by Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan. 0.2 ml of each reactant (crotonaldehyde: 2.42 mmol or cinnamaldehyde: 1.59 mmol) was diluted with 4 ml of 2-butanol as a solvent and was charged in a glass tube with 20 mg of the catalyst. The glass tube was inserted in the autoclave.

Hydrogen was charged and discharged several times in order to substitute the air in the autoclave with hydrogen. The autoclave was heated up to 403 K in an oil bath in which the temperature was controlled by a temperature regulator. The reaction lasted for 20 h and the products were analyzed by GC for the crotonaldehyde hydrogenation and by HPLC for the cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation with an internal standard of 0.2 ml of cyclohexane and 0.2 ml of benzyl alcohol, respectively. 3. Results and discussion The reaction pathway of the selective hydrogenation is shown in Fig. 1. Expected products are the corresponding unsaturated alcohol, referred to as UOL (1), saturated aldehyde, referred to as SAL (2), and saturated alcohol, referred to as SOL (3). The path from the unsaturated alcohol (1) to the saturated aldehyde (2), UOL to SAL conversion, should be considered. The SAL is much more stable than the UOL. The hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde is shown in Table 2. No crotyl alcohol was observed on Rh/Si02, whereas a considerable amount of crotyl alcohol was formed on RhSn/SiOZ as shown in Table 2. Over Sn/SiOZ, a markedly high selectivity (94.4%) with a yield of 22% was obtained. This high selectivity was not obtained over any other conventional metallic hydrogenation catalysts like Rh or Ru cata- Table 2 Hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over Rh/S'02 Catalyst Yield (%) Butyraldehyde 1-Butanol Crotyl alcohol L19 C=O reduction R~CHO ~ R~/~OH C=C reduction inha conversir (2) C=C reduction .CHO > R'\"_\"\"\"\"_\"\"OH reduction (4) R=CH3 or Ph Fig. 1.

Especially, a, /3-unsaturated aldehyde is hardly hydrogenated to the corresponding unsaturated alcohol because the stability of the saturated aldehyde form. Figs. 2 and 3 indicate the hydrogenation reaction of crotyl alcohol over Rh/S'02 and Rh-Sn/Si02, respectively. The hydrogenation of crotyl alcohol to 1-butanol (UOL to SOL) easily proceeded over Rh/Si02, and crotyl alcohol to butyraldehyde (UOL to SAL) conversion was also remarkable. A considerable amount of butyraldehyde was formed over Rh/S'02 as shown in Fig. 2. On the other hand, the formation of butyraldehyde from crotyl alcohol over Rh-Sn/Si02 was less than over Rh/S'02 as shown in Fig. 3. The hydrogenation reaction of UOL to SOL was not so remarkable over Rh-Sn/S'02 as shown in Fig. 3. These results indicate that the UOL to SAL conversion was suppressed by the addition of Sn and that the successive hydrogenation of the Selectivity of crotyl alcohol (%) Rh/S'02 5.4 46.4 0.0 0.0 Rh-Sn/Si02 a 8.6 1.5 17.0 62.7 Rh-Sn/Si02 b 8.0 15.0 47.8 67.5 Sn/Si02 0.0 1.3 22.1 94.4 a Reaction time: 5 h. b Reaction time: 20 h.

UOL to SOL was also suppressed by the addition of Sn. The activity of the Sn/Si02 catalyst was smaller than Rh-Sn/Si02. The selectivity should be compared under a similar conversion in successive reactions, because the selectivity will be expected to depend strongly on conversion level. Table 2 also indicates the results of Rh-Sn/S'02 under low conversion (27.1%), which showed the similar value over Sn/Si02 (23.4%). Under the similar conversion level, the selectivity of crotyl alcohol formation over Sn/Si02 (94.4%) was superior to that over Rh-Sn/Si02 (67.5%).

The change of each yield of the products over Rh-Sn/Si02 during the reaction time is indicated in Fig. 4. The formation of crotyl alcohol was increased with the reaction time. On the other hand, butyraldehyde was increased during the initial period of the reaction time and a decrease of butyraldehyde and increase of 1-butanol were observed. These results suggest that the formation of 1-butanol was mainly attributed to the successive hydrogenation of butyraldehyde over Rh-Sn/Si02. The successive hydrogenation of crotyl alcohol to 1-butanol was not so important over Rh-Sn/Si02. The Sn in Rh-Sn/Si02 effectively suppressed the successive hydrogenation of crotyl alcohol. The results for cinnamaldehyde are indicated in Table 3. Over Rh/Si02, a complete hydrogenated product (3-phenyl- l-propanol) was only obtained at 100% of conversion, whereas a significant amount of cinnamyl alcohol (67.7%) was formed over the Rh-Sn/S'02 bimetallic catalyst at 99% of conversion. Only cinnamyl alcohol was observed over the Sn/Si02 catalyst under the same reaction condition over Rh/ and Rh-Sn/S'02 catalysts. The conversion of cinnamaldehyde was controlled in the range of 40-50% in order to compare the selectivity. S.

Under ca. 400 of conversion, the Rh-Sn/S'02 catalyst indicated 66.3% of selectivity, whereas Sn/Si02 showed 100% of selectivity as shown in Table 3. The selectivity of cinnamyl alcohol did not strongly depend on the conversion, whereas the selectivity of 3-phenyl-l-propanol and 3-phenylpropionaldehyde was affected by the conversion of cinnamaldehyde. Our previous results over the Rh-Sn/S'02 catalysts suggested that the active component for hydrogenation (active site for activation of hydrogen molecules) was Rh, and that Sn controlled the adsorption state of crotonaldehyde. The Rh-Sn neighboring pair sites brought about the activated adsorption of the -CH=O group preferentially. The supported Sn catalyst was not active for the H2-D2 exchange reaction and ethylene hydrogenation [20,21]. We considered that the role of Sn in the Rh-Sn bimetallic system was the suppression of -C=C- hydrogenation as well as accelerating -CH=O hydrogenation [ 18,19]. The results in this paper clearly indicate that the Sn on silica itself, is active for the hydrogenation of -CH=O groups in unsaturated aldehydes. The side reactions, -C=Chydrogenation and UOL to SAL conversion (i.e. from crotyl alcohol to butyraldehyde), were completely suppressed, because the hydrogenation of the -C=C- group proceeded on the group VIII components. The catalytic behavior of the formation of UOL was markedly different from the formation of SAL and SOL as shown in Fig. 4. The formation of SAL and SOL was considered one of the primary hydrogenation products and successive hydrogenated products, respectively. The formation of UOL indicated that the UOL is not an intermediate in the reaction but the final product. These results indicate that the reaction mechanism of the formation of UOL over Sn/Si02 should be different from the formation of SAL and SOL. The reaction mechanism is not clear now, but it can be considered that the hydrogen atoms which were participating in the reduction of -CH=O groups over Sn/Si02 catalysts did not directly come from gaseous hydrogen molecules. Although further detailed investigation is required with respect to the feature of the Sn/Si02 for the selective hydrogenation in heterogeneous catalysis, this unique catalytic behavior over the Sn/Si02 catalyst should be noted.

Nishiyama ∗ T. Kubota K. Kimura S. Tsuruya M. Masai Department of Chemical Science and Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Kobe University, Rokkodai, Nada, Kobe 657, Japan ∗ Corresponding author. Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes, crotonaldehyde (CH3CHCHCHO) and cinnamaldehyde (C6H5CHCHCHO), has been studied over SiO2-supported monometallic Sn and bimetallic RhSn catalysts in the liquid phase. Over a silica-supported monometallic Rh catalyst, Rh SiO2 , no unsaturated alcohol (crotyl alcohol or cinnamyl alcohol) was formed, whereas considerable amounts of the corresponding saturated aldehyde and saturated alcohol were obtained. The selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol was improved over the RhSn bimetallic catalyst. The selectivity to the corresponding unsaturated alcohol attained ca. 65% over the RhSn bimetallic catalysts. On the other hand, The supported Sn catalyst showed markedly high selectivity to the unsaturated alcohols. The selectivity of the Sn SiO2 , attained 95% to crotyl alcohol and 100% to cinnamyl alcohol, respectively. Although the conversion of each unsaturated aldehyde over RhSn SiO2 catalysts was greater than that over Sn SiO2 catalysts, the selectivity of Sn SiO2 catalysts to the corresponding unsaturated alcohols was superior to that over RhSn SiO2 . The selectivity of Sn SiO2 was also compared with that of RhSn SiO2 at a similar conversion of the unsaturated aldehydes. The selectivity of Sn SiO2 was significantly greater than that of the RhSn bimetallic catalyst. These results indicate that the high selectivity over Sn SiO2 was ascribed not to low conversion but to intrinsic selectivity of the Sn catalyst.
