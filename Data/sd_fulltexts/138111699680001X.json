The effect of metal panicle size on the catalytic activity and selectivity has been studied by using catalysts having a metal dispersion ranging from 0.05 to 0.88. It has been observed that the overall rate of hydrogation of both the unsaturated aldehydes is not influenced by the Ru particle size. In the hydrogation of cinnamaidehyde a higher selectivity to cinnamyi alcohol has been observed on catalysts with larger metal particle size. No variations have been found in the hydrogation ofcitral. It is suggested that steric effects do not influence significantly the product selectivity. A repulsive interaction between the aromatic ring and the catalyst surface would explain the higher selectivity to cinnamyi alcohol. On all the investigated catalysts the isolated C=C double bond ofcitral shows a low reactivity. It is suggested that the unsaturated aldehyde is adsorbed through the carbonyl group. This strong adsorption prevents the hydrogation of the Collated olefsnic bond which is located far away front the adsorption centers.

Introduction The selective hydrogation ofa,J8-unsaturated aldehydes to the corresponding unsaturated alco- hols is a reaction of great importance in the synthesis of fine chemicals. So far, the stoichio- metric reduction with NaBH4 has been the most commonly used synthetic route due the difficulty to preparing an heterogeneous catalyst able to per- form the hydrogation reaction with high selec- tivity. In the last decade much research effort has been devote 1 to improve the selectivity of heter- ogeneous supported metal catalysts and high yields to unsaturated alcohols have been obtained * Corresponding author. on Group VIII metal catalysts by addition of pro- moters [1-11]. Among the parameters influenc- ing the catalytic activity and selectivity of this reaction, the variation of the catalytic properties with the metal particle size has been widely inves- tigated [3-10]. Bo electronic and geometric effects have been invoked to explain the observed changes hi selectivity. Metal particles size is known to determine the relative proportion of atoms on the comer, edges and pnes of the crystallites. Atoms in a different crystallographic position can have different cata- lytic properties as a result of a different electronic and/or geometric structure. The structure of the reactant molecule air-id its interaction with the metal active sites are also important [2]. Cinna- 1381-1169/96/$15.00 1996 Eisevier Science B.V.

It has been suggested that the pres- ence of a large substituent on the carbon decreases, through a steric effect, the reactivity of the C==C double thus increasing the selectivity to unsaturated alcohois. In this paper we report a study carried out on well characterized Ru-A^O^ catalysts with the aim of studying the influence of the Ru particle size on the activity and selectivity of the liquid- phase hydrogation of cinnamaldehyde and cit- ral. Citral has been chosen since it is an aliphatic unsaturated aldehyde with a bulky substituent on the carbon. Moreover citral and its hydroga- tion products are important chemicals used in the perfumery industry. In a previous paper carried out on Ru/C, we have found that citral hydrog- ation can be regarded as a 'structure insensitive' reaction in the range of dispersion between 0.1- 0.4 [9]. In the present paper we have extended our study to catalysts supported on y-alumina and with a wider range of dispersion. 2. Expimentas 2. Preparation of the catalysts The catalysts were prepared by using ruthenium acetylacetonate (Ru(acac)3, Heraues) or Ru nitrosyi nitrate ( Ru( NO) ( N03 ) 3, Johnson Matthey) as precursors. Samples obtained from Ru(acac)3 were prepared by contacting a toluene solution of the precursor with the support (y- A12, Rhone Poulenc, BET 220 m2 g\"') for many hours. After this step the catalysts were fil- tered, dried at 333 K under vacuum, treated under a nitrogen stream at 523 K for 2 h and then reduced in flowing H;,. Sample RuEC2(0/HTR) was obtained by treatment of the RuEC2 sample at 623 K for l h in air, cooling to room temperature, reduction at 753 K for 4 h under flowing hydrogen. Samples obtained from Ru(NO)(N03)3 were prepared by contacting an aqueous solution of the precursor with the support. The amount of solu- tion used was slightly greater than the pore volume of the A12. After drying for 2 h at 393 K in air, the solids were reduced in FL at 623 K for 3 h. The amount of ruthenium on the catalysts was varied from 1 to 4 wt%. Table 1 reports the chem- ical composition and the main characteristics of all samples. Hydrogen chemisorption measurements were carried out using a static volumetric apparatus. The hydrogen adsorption isotherms were carried out in the pressure range 50-400 Torr at a tem- perature of 373 K. The H/Ru ratio was used to measup: the Ru dispersion ( Ru surface atoms / Ru total atoms). The average ruthenium particle size was calculated (assuming a spherical geometry) from the equation: d (nm) == 6W5, where Vis the ruthenium volume and S the ruthenium surface area. Metal surface area was measured assuming a stoichiometry H/Ru= 1 and a Ru surface den- sity of 1.63 X 1019 atoms m~2 | 12]. Analyses by TEM were performed using a JEOL 100 CX apparatus following the extractive replica technique [13]. EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine truc- ture ) analysis was performed using the beam line at the LURE (Orsay) synchrotron radiation. The samples were reduced in situ by hydrogen flow, following a programmed heating/cooling cycle. More details on the preparation of the catalysts and their characterization are reported elsewhere [13]. 2.2. Catalytic experiments The hydrogation reactions were carried out in a 100 ml four-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a thermocouple, a dropping funnel and a stirred head. Before catalytic measurements the catalysts were reduced for 2 h at 623 K. After cooling at room temperature the catalyst was transferred into the reactor and added to 25 ml of ethanol and treated at 343 K under flowing Hz, for one hour at atmospheric pressure. It has been pre- viously demonstrated [13] that, due the slow oxi- L.

After this step, the reac- tor temperature is lowered to 333 K and 0.1 ml of substrate is injected through one arm of the flask. The progress of the reaction is followed by ana- lyzing a sufficient number of microsamples. Sub- strates and solvent are commercial analytical grade products and were used without further puri- fication. Chemical analysis is performed with a gas Chromatograph HP (model 5890) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a wide-bore capillary column (Supelcowax, 30 m, 0.53 mm i.d.). Quantitative analysis is carried out calculat- ing the area of the Chromatographie peaks using an electron integrator. Catalytic activity was measured in terms of initial turnover raies and calculated from the slope of the curves conversion versus time (0 at t=0. Selectivities were calcu- lated by she expression 5,==C(/p, where C, is the concentration of product ; and Cp the total concentration of the products. Preliminary tests, with different catalyst amount, grain size and stirring rate, were earned out in order to ascertain the absence ofdiffusional limitations. 3. Results The catalytic hydrogations of citral and cin- namaldehyde have been investigated over a series of Ru/Al203 catalysts having a different metal dispersion and obtained from different metal pre- cursors. Catalyst samples have been characterized by several physico-chemical techniques and the mosi pertinent results regarding this communica- tion are reported in Table 1. More details on the characterization results and on the experimental procedures used are reported elsewhere [ 13]. Table 1 summarizes the results of N3 chemi- sorption reported either in terms of the H/Ru ratio and of the calculated average Ru particle size. Moreover the average coordination number of the Ru atoms, as determined by EXAFS, has been reported together with tlie main results of the TEM observations carried out on the examined samples. Tlie results reported in Table 1 show that the size and distribution of the Ru particles depend on 100 Q. E o 0 20- i - -- 70 140 210 350 280 Time (min) Fig. 1.

On the samples prepared from Ru(acac)3, the H/Ru ratio was found to decrease with the Ru loading. This is in agreement with the larger Ru particles observed by TEM. All the sam- ples obtained from Ru(NO)(N03)3 show instead, regardless of the Ru loading, a similar H / Ru ratio (0.23-0.26) and a less homogeneous dis- tribution of the Ru particles. The EXAFS investigation at the Ru K-edge has given results which are in agreement with TEM and chemisorp- tion results. The coordination number, N, was found to increase with decreasing the H/Ru ratio. On all but the RuEC 1 sample, only EXAFS peaks related to Ru-Ru bonds were observed. On the RuECl sample instead, the presence of Ru^-0 species was also observed. This was taken as an indication of a less efficient reduction of this cat- alyst likely due to its small particles ^vhich lead to a strong interaction with the support. The amount of Ru\"4\" species has been estimated to be below 10% of the total Ru content. A Ru/A^O, sample (RuEC2(0/HTR)) having large metal particles (27 nm) was obtained from the RuEC2 catalyst by oxidation in air at 623 K followed by reduction at 753 K. In order to avoid interference of residual chlo- ride ions on the catalytic performance, all the cat- alysts investigated were prepared by using precursors which do not contain chlorine. Fig. 1 show a typical product distribution as a function of the reaction time obtained during the hydrogation of citral. Since a mixture of the isomers E and Z of citral has been used the cor- responding isomeric a.unsaturated alcohols ( geraniol and nerol ) were obtained through the hydrogation of the carbonyl group, en the first stages, the reaction was found to proceed through two parallel routes leading to citronellal and a unsaturated alcohols. Citronellol and the fully sat- urated alcohol (3,7-dimethyl-octanol) were formed at higher reaction times according to 'OH Cinnamyi alcohoj Scheme 2.

A detailed discussion of the mecha- nism of hydrogation ofcitral over Ru supported catalysts is reported elsewhere [14]. It is inter- esting to note that the addition of Hz to the isolated C==C doubie bond occurs only after the C=0 group has been hydrogenated. Under the same experimental conditions, hydrogation of cinnamaldehyde proceeds through a reaction mechanism (Scheme 2) simi- lar to that described for the hydrogation ofcitra The effect of the Ru dispersion ( measured by the H/Ru ratio) on the initial rate of hydroga- tion of citral and cinnamaldehyde is reported in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, respectively Even ?hough it is not possible to derive a mean particle size in the case of bi modal distribution, as there is from TEM in a number of cases ( Table 1 ), all the character- ization results (TEM, EXAFS, chemisorption) '.ire consisterit with an increase of Ru particle size .vith dbcie-'-sing the H/Ru ratio. We. have therefore reported in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 the corresponding Ru particle size calculated by N3 chemisorption. Of course the derived conclusions have to be inter- preted with appropriate caution. The initial turn- over rates (Wn) are based on hydrogen chemisorption and expressed as molecules of sub strafe reactmg per ruthenium surface atom per sec- ond. For both reactions the initial turnover rate was found almost constant in all range of disper- sion investigated.

Ru(acac)3 and Ru(NO)(N03)3 gave similar results. The effect of the H/Ru ratio on the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols is reported in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 for the hydrogation of citral and cinna- maldehyde, respectively. The selectivity values reported in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 have been measured at 50% conversion. It should be however noted that the same results are found in a large range of conversion. The selectivity to unsaturated alco- hols is scarcely influenced by the level of conver- sion. The selectivity to citronellal was instead found to decrease with increasing conversion with a corresponding increase in the selectivity to citro- nellol. Results on the influence of the conversion levels on the product selectivity is reported in Fig. 6. Fig. 4 shows that in the hydrogation ofcitra the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols remains almost constant regardless of the Ru dispersion. Fig. 5 shows instead that in the hydrogation of cinnamaldehyde a larger amount of unsaturated alcohols is obtained on the catalyst samples hav- ing a lower H/Ru ratio. In Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 are also reported, for com- parison, the results previously obtained on Ru/C [5,9] which show that the effect of Ru particle size on the hydrogation of citral and cinnamal- dehyde is similar regardless of the support used. However, on the Ru/C samples a shift (20%) to a higher selectivity to unsaturated alcohols has been observed. 4. Discussion The results reported in the previous section show the following main features: 1. On RU/A03 hydrogation ol citral and cin- namaldehyde occur with a similar turnover rate. In both cases the rate of reaction is inde- pendent on the Ru dispersion. 2. Addition of hydrogen to citral takes place exclusively on the carbonyi group and on the conjugated C=C double bond. The hydrog- ation of the isolated C==C double bond starts only after the aldehydes (citral and citronel- lal) have been transformed to alcohols. 3. The Ru dispersion plays a different role in the hydrogation of the two investigated mole- cules. In the hydrogation ordtral the selec- tivity to unsaturated alcohols remains constant in all range of H/Ra ratios investi- gated. A higher selectivity cinnamyl alco- hol is instead observed in the hydrogation of cinnamaldehyde on the samples showing a lower H/Ru ratio. On all Ru samples (Fig. 2 .nd Fig. 3) the rate of hydrogation is independent on the H/Ru ratio. The same turnover rate has also been observed on the RuEC 1 sample notwith- standing that on this catalyst a fraction of the Ru atoms is not completely reduced. The EXAFS measurements have shown that on this sample a fraction of the metal atoms are in the form of Ru even after in situ treat- ment at 400. This seems to suggest that the same amount of atoms which are counted by chemisorption are responsible for the catalytic hydrogation of the aldehydes. It is likely that the 'unreduced' ruthenium does not chemisorb hydrogen and does not participate to the catalytic hydrogation. However it should be noted that the amount of Ru0^ esti- mated by EXFAS is less than 10% of the total Ru content and therefore variation of the cat- alytic activity due to the presence ofRu^ can be accounted within the experimental error. In the hydrogation of citral it has been observed that the addition of hydrogen to the L. Mercadante et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 105 (1996) 93-101 99 isolated C==C double bond does not occur until molecules containing carbonyl groups are present in the reaction mixture. In order to check the reactivity of a simple olefin and to rule out the presence of some steric effect, the hydrogation of 3,7-dimethyl-l-octene has been investigated. At 333 K the reaction was very fast and it was necessary to run the hydro- gation at lower temperature in order to avoid the influence of mass transfer limita- tions. At 283 K the turnover rate of the hydro- gation of 3,7-dimethyl-l-octene was about one order of magnitude faster than the turno- ver rates measured at 333 K on the unsaturated aldehydes. These results suggest that the alde- hydes are adsorbed on the Ru surface through the carbonyl or the conjugated C=C-C=-0 group, the strong adsorption of which pre- vents the hydrogation of the isolated C=C double bond which is located far away from the adsorption centers. Fig. 4 shows the influence of the Ru dis- persion on the selectivity to geraniol + nerol, SON. For comparison the results previously obtained on Ru/C (taken from r. [9] ) have been also reported. In all range of Ru disper- sion investigated 5cN remains constant ( about 15% on Ru/AlAand about 35% on Ru/C). Notwithstanding the limitations, evidenced in the results section, in deriving a mean particle size from the H/Ru ratio, it should be pointed out that all the characterization results obtained on the investigated samples are con- sistent with an increase in the number of metal particles having a larger size with decreasing the H/Ru ratio. A direct correlation can be in fact observed between the average particle size derived from the chemiscrption experi- ments and the average coordination number measured by EXAFS. Therefore it can be con- cluded that selectivity to geraniol, 5oN. remains constant regardless of the Ru particle size. Increasing the metal particle size the frac- tion ofRu surface atoms at the edge and comer sites decreases whereas the fraction of Ru atoms located on flat planes increases. The absence of an effect of particle size on the product selectivity suggests that the geometry and the coordination number of the Ru sites are not important factors in the hydrogation of citral to citronellal or to unsaturated alcohols. The lower selectivity obtained on Ru/ A12 compared to the values previously reported on Ru/C is likely due to the presence of impurities (mainly Fe) on the surface of the carbon support. Fe is known to act as pro- moter for selective hydrogation of unsatu- rated aldehydes [15,16]. Moreover it has been suggested that an electron transfer from the support to metal can decrease the proba- bility of the activation of the C=C bond [ 17]. The effect of particle size on the hydrog- ation of unsaturated aldehydes is a controver- sial issue. Literature data have shown that the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols may depend on the substituents R and R' present on the carbon and on the morphology of the active sites [7-9,18]. Birchem et a [19] have pointed out that in the gas-phase hydro- gation of methylcrotonaldehyde (R=CH3, R'=CH3) carried out on single crystal Pt( 111 ) the activation of the C=C bond is difficult because the accommodation of the two methyl groups is hindered by the three- fold symmetry of the flat Pt( 111 ) plane. This interpretation takes into account the higher selectivity to unsaturated alcohol observed in the hydrogation of 3-methylcrotonalde- hyde with respect to crotonaldehyde. On the highly unsaturated surface atoms of the Pt( 100) planes the accommodation of the methyl groups is instead easier because of the fourfold symmetry of the Pt( 100) [20]. This has been shown to result in a lower selectivity to unsaturated alcohols. From these model studies, a structure sensitivity is to be expected when bulky substituents are presents on the carbon of the substrate. In accord with this hypothesis. Coq et al. [ 7 ] have reported that in the gas-phase hydro- L. Mercadante el at. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical /05 (1996) 93-101 genation of acrolein (R==H, R'=H) the selectivity to allyl alcohol does not change much with Ru particle size. In a recent paper, Marinel et al. [18] have reported that in the gas phase hydrogation of u;,j8-unsaturated aldehydes the selectivity to unsaturated alco- hols increases with increasing substitution on the terminal olefinic carbon atoms. Investigations on the effect of the metal particle size on the hydrogation ofaliphatic a.unsaturated aldehydes have been carried mostly on aldehydes containing relatively small groups (~H and -CF^) as substituents on the carbon. Citral is an aldehyde with a very bulky aliphatic substituent in the car- bon position, so it is more suitable to probe any steric effect. The results of Fig. 4 show the absence of any variation in the selectivity with changing the Ru particle size. This indi- cates that in the conditions used in this work steric effects are not very important. It should be noted however that in our case the reaction was carried out in the presence of ethanol. It is known that the solvent molecules may ihter- act with the metal surface by changing the adsorption mode of substrate [21]. Nitta et al. [6,8] have reported, that when ethanol is used as solvent, in the liquid-phase reduction of acrolein and crotonaldehyde over CO/A03, the selectivity to the unsaturated alcohols increases for both substrates with the size of the Co crystallites. The higher selec- tivity observed in the hydrogation of cro- tonaldehyde with respect to acrolein has been suggested to depend largely on the steric effect of the methyl group on carbon of the substrate which inhibits the hydrogation of the C=C double bound. Such an effect is emphasized by the presence of residual chlo- rine on the surface. Due to the absence of steric effects on the acrolein, it was proposed that some electronic effect must be responsi- ble for the higher selectivity to unsaturated alcohols on the larger Co crystallites [8]. In the hydrogation of cinnamaldehyde the influence of the Ru disoersion on the selec- tivity to cinnamyi alcohol shows two regions (Fig. 5). At H/Ru values higher than 0.2 the selectivity increases only slightly with decreasing the Ru dispersion. At H/Ru values lower than 0.2 a sharp increase in the selectiv- ity is instead observed. The same behaviour is found on Ru/Al203 and on Ru/C. The observation that the largest variation is observed at low Ru dispersion rules out the possibility that the higher selectivity is due to a change in the coordination number of the Ru surface atoms. It is known that the largest variation in the fraction of metal sites located at the edges or comers with respect to those located on the flat planes is more evident for small particle {\\-5 nm which correspond to variation in the H/Ru ratio of about 1-0.3). Moreover the results of the hydrogation of citral show out that a simple steric effect can- not account for the observed changes. For the hydrogation of cinnamaldehyde the higher selectivity to cinnarnyl alcohol observed on the largest metal particles is in agreement with previous observations on other metal catalysts [6,22]. These results have been explained by Gallezot et al. [4] by considering that on the flat metal surface of a iarge particle, the unsaturated aldehyde is tilted out from the surface owing to a repulsive interaction occurring between the aromatic ring and the metal which protect the C==C double bond from hydrogation. In conclusion, the results reported in the present paper while confirming the positive effect of the metal particle size on the forma- tion of cinnamyi alcohol in the hydrogation of cinnamaldehyde have ruled out the pres- ence of a steric effect on the hydrogation of a bulky aldehyde such as citral.

The hydrogenation of citral and cinnamaldehyde has been investigated over Ru/Al2O3 catalysts. The effect of metal particle size on the catalytic activity and selectivity has been studied by using catalysts having a metal dispersion ranging from 0.05 to 0.88. It has been observed that the overall rate of hydrogenation of both the unsaturated aldehydes is not influenced by the Ru particle size. In the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde a higher selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol has been observed on catalysts with larger metal particle size. No variations have been found in the hydrogenation of citral. It is suggested that steric effects do not influence significantly the product selectivity. A repulsive interaction between the aromatic ring and the catalyst surface would explain the higher selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol. On all the investigated catalysts the isolated CC double bond of citral shows a low reactivity. It is suggested that the unsaturated aldehyde is adsorbed through the carbonyl group. This strong adsorption prevents the hydrogenation of the isolated olefinic bond which is located far away from the adsorption centers.
