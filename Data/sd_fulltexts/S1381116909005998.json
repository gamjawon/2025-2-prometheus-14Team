High conversion and selectivities were obtained with a H9252-CD bearing methyl group on the secondary face and PEO chains on the primary face.

A remarkable activity was found to be related to the catalyst ability to restore the copper surface dispersion after the reduction or the oxidation pre-treatment. Renan Tavares Figueiredo, Heloysa Martins Carvalho Andrade, José L.G. Fierro Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 318 (2010) 15 Influence of the preparation methods and redox properties of Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 catalysts for the water gas shift reaction The surface species of WO x /TiO 2 catalysts, were correlated with the abundance of relatively strong Brønsted acid sites and isopropanol dehydration activity. A direct correlation was observed between the abundance of these acid sites, the intensity of the infrared band attributed to the most condensed W species and propene formation rate. Thomas Onfroy, Vanessa Lebarbier, Guillaume Clet, Marwan Houalla Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 318 (2010) 1 Quantitative relationship between the nature of surface species and the catalytic activity of tungsten oxides supported on crystallized titania vi Contents This paper describes the synthesis of a polymer-anchored oxovanadium(IV) complex, and its catalytic activity towards the oxidation of styrene, thioanisole and ethylbenzene using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. Zenixole R. Tshentu, Chamunorwa Togo, Ryan S. Walmsley Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 318 (2010) 30 Polymer-anchored oxovanadium(IV) complex for the oxidation of thioanisole, styrene and ethylbenzene Rice husk ash was used as support to copper (Cu/RHA) and tested their feasibility for partial oxidation of methanol (POM) to produce H 2 . The Cu/RHA catalyst with 10.2 wt.% Cu loading, calcined at 673 K has higher copper dispersion, smaller Cu particle size and higher Cu surface area. This catalyst exhibits higher activity and selectivity for POM to produce H 2 . Wun-Syong Chen, Feg-Wen Chang, L. Selva Roselin, Ti-Cheng Ou, Szu-Chia Lai Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 318 (2010) 36 Partial oxidation of methanol over copper catalysts supported on rice husk ash The copper(II) complex [Cu 2 (H 2 O) 2 (µ-L) 2 ] (H 2 L = 3-(2-hydroxy-4-nitrophenylhydrazo)pentane-2,4-dione) is catalytically active in the peroxidative oxidation of cyclohexane and in the TEMPO-mediated aerobic oxidation of benzylic alcohols.

Characterization results showed the presence of oxygenated carbonaceous species left on the surface from the impregnation step. These species, that were stable through oxidation and reduction pre-treatment steps, may possibly contribute to the activity, selectivity and stability of the catalysts by keeping the Co particles segregated and by blocking the sites for side reactions. Hua Song, Umit S. Ozkan Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 318 (2010) 21 The role of impregnation medium on the activity of ceria-supported cobalt catalysts for ethanol steam reforming Contents vii The activity of iron–cerium oxide catalysts in cyclohexene oxidation using aqueous H 2 O 2 (30%, v/v) was investigated. The highest cyclohexene conversion (99 mol%) and epoxide selectivity (98 mol%) rates were observed using 5%Fe/CeO 2 at 100 °C: this greater activity and selectivity was attributed to monolayer dispersion of the Fe species and enhanced reducibility of the catalyst.

This nanocomposite was used as a green and recyclable heterogeneous photocatalyst for rapid and efficient reductive cleavage of azobenzenes into corresponding amines with 2-propanol.

The prepared catalysts have been characterized by several techniques such as XRD, FT-IR, DR-spectroscopy, BET, 51 V solid-state NMR, SEM and EDX.

Compared to a reference zeolite sample, nanocrystalline ZSM-5 presents a quite superior activity due to the improved accessibility to the active sites derived from its small crystal size. David P. Serrano, Rafael van Grieken, Juan Antonio Melero, Alicia García, Carolina Vargas Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 318 (2010) 68 Nanocrystalline ZSM-5: A catalyst with high activity and selectivity for epoxide rearrangement reactions viii Contents Cu-amine-MCM-41 samples show good activity for single step liquid phase amination of benzene to aniline. The 20Cu-amine modified sample shows highest catalytic activity having 72.2% benzene conversion and 100% aniline selectivity. Cu and amine modified samples prepared by co-condensation method show better activity than samples prepared by impregnation technique and that of without amine. K.M. Parida, Dharitri Rath, S.S. Dash Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 318 (2010) 85 Synthesis, characterization and catalytic activity of copper incorporated and immobilized mesoporous MCM-41 in the single step amination of benzene (1 0 1) plane of H9252-Bi 2 Mo 2 O 9 formed on H9253(L)-Bi 2 MoO 6 seems to be active and selective sites for partial oxidation of C 3 H 6 . The acrolein formation from C 3 H 6 takes place at H9252-phase sites and the incorporation of oxygen from gaseous O 2 at the anion vacancies of H9253(L)- phase.

The discharge energy of Li/SOCl 2 battery catalyzed by MPcs and MTAPs depending on the central metal ion of the compounds, while it catalyzed by MPTpzs almost independent of central metal ions. MTAPs are the most effective catalysts among them.
