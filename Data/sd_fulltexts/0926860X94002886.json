Introduction Polymer supported catalysts represent a class of materials that play a role of growing importance in synthetic technologies [ 1 ]. The most renown examples are the ion exchange resins based on sulphonated polystyrene, which are employed as * Corresponding author. E-mail kralik@checdek.chtf.stuba.sk, tel. ( + 42-7) 495242, fax.

Biffis et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 355-365 acid catalysts in a number of industrial applications like e.g. the synthesis of MTBE, TAME, methyl vinyl ketone, isoamylene, dianone and in phenol alkylation [ 1 ]. These resins are also employed as supports for metal crystallites, and a Pd-supported catalyst of this kind (Bayer K 6333) is currently extensively employed for the removal of oxygen, down to the ppb level, from water to be used in power plants [ 1 ]. Moreover, polymer matrices are now utilized on industrial scale as supports for enzymes in biocatalized processes such as the synthesis of aspartic and fumaric acid (Tanabe Seiyaky) [2], of lactase-free milk and 6-amino penicillanic acid (Snamprogetti) [2] and for the conversion of acrylonitrile into acrylamide (ca. 10 000 tons/year) [3] ; this new area of application is rapidly expanding [4,5]. Despite the extensive utilization of these materials, little effort appears to have been devoted to the evaluation of the influence of the morphological and physico- chemical properties of the polymer support on the final activity of the catalyst, although these have long been recognized to be a key feature [6-8]. This is particularly true when the support is partially or totally microp0rous, in that its morphology in the working state cannot be thoroughly characterized by simple means, e.g. mercury porosimetry and BET methods [6,7]. We have recently reported on the synthesis and physico-chemical characteriza- tion of novel dimethylacrylamide-based microporous ion-exchange resins, suitable for supporting palladium crystallites to yield mainly hydrophillic, molecularly accessible bifunctional catalysts [ 9,10]. In this paper, a set of catalysts based on resins of the same chemical nature will be characterized through a combination of unrelated physico-chemical techniques such as X-ray microprobe analysis (XRMA), inverse steric exclusion chromatography (ISEC) [ 11 ], X-ray diffrac- tion, electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, and selected catalytic tests utilizing as model reaction the hydrogenation of cyclohexene. Our aim is to correlate the physico-chemical properties of the polymer-supported catalysts, as they appear from the characterization, with their catalytic activity. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials Reagent-grade N,N-dimethylacrylamide ( DMAA ), methylene bis (acrylamide) (MBAA), and sodium 4-styrylsulphonate (SS) were purchased from Aldrich, as were dimethylformamide (DMF), ethanol (EtOH), tetrahydrofuran (THF), tol- uene (TOL), acetone (AC), cyclohexene and sodium borohydride. Methanol (MeOH), ethyl acetate (EAC), diethyl ether (DETE) and dichloromethane (DCM) were supplied by Carlo Erba ( RPE reagents ). Tetraaminepalladium nitrate was supplied by Strem. All products were employed as received, apart from cyclohexene which was purified by distillation prior to use. A, Biffis et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 355-365 357 Fig. 1. SEM picture of P8N particles. 2.2. Apparatus Grinding of the resins was performed with a Btihler H04 impact grinder. Ele- mental analyses (C, H, N, S) were carried out by means of a Carlo Erba 1106 Analyzer. Atomic absorption measurements (Na, Pd) were performed with a Perkin-Elmer 3030 atomic absorption spectrometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and XRMA analyses were carried out by means of a Cambridge Stereoscan 250 EDX PW 9800 apparatus. Average sizes of the metal crystallites were estimated by X- ray diffraction measurements using a DRON UM 1 diffractometer equipped with a Co Ka X-ray source [10] ESR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ER 200D X- band spectrometer. 2.3. Catalyst syntheses The synthesis of a 4% crosslinked copolymer DMAA-MBAA-SS (P4N), as well as of a Pd-supported catalyst based on it (P4NPd8) have been reported elsewhere [9]. With the same procedure, an 8% crosslinked copolymer (P8N) was prepared, utilizing 0.98 g MBAA, 5.17 g DMAA, 4.12 g SS and 6.91 g water (yield 9.55 g, 93.0%). The resulting material was ground by impact grinding in a water suspen- sion. A SEM picture of particles of P8N resin after grinding is shown in Fig. 1. Palladium incorporation was performed upon reacting P8N with an aqueous solution of tetraamine palladium nitrate, according to refs. [9,10]. Two samples were prepared, with a palladium content of 2.5% (P8NPd2) and 9% (P8NPd9). In the same manner, a sample based on P4N and containing 2.3% Pd (P4NPd2) was prepared. The catalyst precursors were then treated with 0.066 M sodium borohydride in ethanol ( 10 times excess), a procedure which in the case of P4N- based catalysts has proven to be useful for obtaining a uniform distribution of palladium crystallites throughout the particles [9,10]. The essential features of the employed catalysts are summarized in Table 2. 358 A. Biffis et al./Applied CatalysisA: General 124 (1995) 355-365 All materials were sieved to separate fractions of different particle sizes to be used in the characterization procedures. 2.4. Elemental analyses A weighted amount of resin (about 0.1 g) was digested in 1 cm3 of concentrated nitric acid, 1 cm3 of concentrated sulphuric acid and 5 cm3 of concentrated hydrogen peroxide, and the solution obtained was diluted to a concentration suitable for atomic absorption measurements. 2.5. Solvent compatibility The solvent compatibility of the resins was evaluated from their bulk expanded volume (BEV) in various solvents [8]. The measurements were performed util- izing the procedure described in ref. [9]. 2.6. ISEC measurements ISEC measurements were performed as described in ref. [ 11 ] ; for operational details, see also ref. [ 12]. 2.7. ESR measurements About 0.25 g of ground resin were swollen with a nitrogen saturated 10-4 M solution of TEMPONE (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-oxyl-piperidine) in MeOH. The samples were allowed to reach swelling equilibrium, typically after about 2 h. After removal of the solution upon filtration under nitrogen atmosphere, the swollen samples were placed inside the ESR tube and the spectra were taken. 2.8. Catalytic tests Catalytic experiments were carried out in a 50 cm3 glass-lined stainless steel reactor connected with a flexible metal capillary to an apparatus for measuring the hydrogen consumption at constant pressure [ 13 ]. Experiments were performed at room temperature and 0.5 MPa. Typically, 10 ml of a 1 M solution of cyclohexene in methanol were employed, with an amount of catalyst yielding an analytical concentration of palladium of 0.4 mmol/1. The reactor was filled with reactants, catalyst and hydrogen, immersed in an oil bath and vigorously agitated using a shaker (frequency about 3 Hz). 3. Results and discussion The elemental analysis of P8N is reported in Table 1. Like in the case of P4N [ 9,10], the determined figures for sulphur and sodium are somewhat lower than A.

Solvent compatibility of P8N is illustrated in Fig. 2, in comparison with the values for P4N. As a consequence of the increased crosslinking degree, PSN is less swellable than P4N, but the changes in BEV show the same pattern; swellability is good in water, methanol and ethanol, so these media are the most suitable ones for the chemical utilization of P8N. The effect of the lower accessibility in P8N results in the non-uniform metal distribution in the case of PSNPd9 (Fig. 3). If the metal content is lowered, the ratio of the mobility of the reducing agent to that of the metal ions is increased, and a uniform distribution can again be obtained [ 9, l0 ], as shown in the case of PSNPd2 (Fig. 4). Obtaining a uniform distribution of metal crystallites was important, since a catalyst with a non-uniform distribution does not have a constant activity in a stirred reactor, as will be illustrated below. Moreover, a uniform distribution was a necessary requirement for mathematical modelling [ 14] and comparison of P4N and P8N. The properties of the catalysts are summarized in Table 2. 3.1. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements X-ray diffraction profiles were treated in the same way as in ref. [10]. Fig. 5 shows a comparison between the swelling volume in ethanol (reduction medium), metal content and average size of metal crystallites. The metal crystallites size appears to decrease with decreasing metal content (first two columns in the figure), and with decreasing swelling volume (last two columns). 360 A.

ISEC pattern of P4NPd8 and P8NPd9 in 0.2 M aqueous sodium sulphate. polymer matrix used as chromatographic column filling, on the basis of a mathe- matical treatment of the elution data of standard solutes [ 11 ]. ISEC is probably the most powerful technique for the evaluation of the morphology of swollen micro- porous polymer supports. It describes the polymer mass in terms of volume distri- bution (cm3/g) on a set of discrete fractions with different polymer chain density (nm/nm3=nm-2). A very precise value of the swelling volume can also be obtained by subtracting the void volume of the column from the total column volume. Swelling volumes in methanol for the materials under investigation are reported in Table 2. The ISEC picture was determined using a set of five fractions characterized by a polymer chain density of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 nm-2. The characterization was done in 0.2 M aqueous sodium sulphate, on catalysts P4NPd8 and P8NPd9. The results are shown in Fig. 6. It is evident that the macromolecular structure of these materials is heterogene- ous, in that they are formed by two main fractions with different chain density. 362 A. Biffis et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 355-365 This is not surprising, since crosslinked copolymers possess an intrinsic degree of inhomogeneity, which is the consequence of kinetic implications related to the copolymerization reaction mechanism [6,7]. The effect of increasing crosslinking is also evident, in that the lower density fraction is shifted towards higher density values on going from P4NPd8 to P8NPd9. 3.3. ESR measurements ESR spectra of paramagnetic probes penetrated into a swollen polymer matrix yield information on the hindrances to the rotational motion of the probe, with respect to the motion in the 'bulk' solvent. This information is expressed by the parameter 'rotational correlation time' ~-, which is defined as the time needed by the probe to span one radiant, and can be easily calculated from spectral parameters [ 15]. The degree of rotational mobility of the probe also provides indirect infor- mation on the degree of translational mobility, hence on the diffusion phenomena within the polymer support. The ESR characterization was performed on catalysts P4NPd2 and P8NPd2, swollen with a solution of TEMPONE in MeOH. Spectra were recorded at different temperatures; the resulting correlation times are reported in Fig. 7. As expected, the ~- value for P8NPd2 is at each temperature significantly and consistently larger than the value for P4NPd2, indicating stronger hindrances to the rotational motion due to the increased crosslinking degree. The Arrhenius depend- ence of ~-on the temperature has already been observed [ 16,17], and is considered as an indication that the motional hindrances are essentially due to microviscosity phenomena [18]. The resulting activation energy is the same for both catalysts ( 14.6 kJ/mol). Fig. 8 shows the correlation between ~- and the reciprocal of the swelling volume (calculated on the basis of ISEC experiments) which is directly proportional to the average polymer chain concentration in the swollen support. It can be seen that the points for the two samples are in line with the point referring to the bulk solution ( 1/swelling volume = 0). Such behaviour has already been encountered [ 19] and 7 6.5- o 6- = 5.5- 5- 4.5 , , 3 3.5 4 4.5 I000xl/T(K) Fig. 7.

Correlation between in q- and the reciprocal of the swelling volume S. interpreted on the basis of a physico-mathematical model [ 17] centred on the assumption that the environment within the swollen polymer support can be regarded as a concentrated polymer solution [6,7]. All these findings point out that, for the description of the diffusional phenomena, the environment within this kind of supports is more conveniently depicted as a polymer solution than as a more or less rigid system of 'cavities' defined by the polymer chains. This observation can be exploited for deriving some useful rela- tionships between rotational correlation times, translational diffusional coefficients, and swelling volume of the polymer support. An example of this will be given in ref. [ 14]. 3.4. Catalytic tests In order to estimate the influence of the macromolecular structure of the support, and of the metal concentration and metal distribution on the catalytic activity, we performed catalytic tests which are summarized in Fig. 9 and 10.

Size of catalyst particles 0.1-0.3 mm. repeated at least once, and reproducibility was found satisfactory, the variance in the conversion being less than 5%. Fig. 9 summarizes the results for various catalysts under the same reaction conditions. The highest rate is achieved in the experiment with P4NPd2; the rate with P8NPd2 is lower, as qualitatively predictable on the basis of the higher crosslinking degree and consequently decreased swellability. The rate with P4NPd8 was even lower, which observation is not surprising in view of the higher metal concentration in the particles. In fact, achieving the same analytical palladium concentration in the reaction mixture implies that a lower amount of catalyst has to be utilized, so that mass transfer and diffusional hindrances become more impor- tant, as is suggested by the shape of the conversion curve. The disadvantages in utilizing in batch systems a polymer-supported metal cat- alyst with metal crystallites mainly located on the outer surface of the particles is well documented by the experiments with P8NPd9, illustrated in Fig. 10. In the first run, this catalyst appears to be even more active than P4NPdS, due to the higher accessibility of the metal crystallites. However, metal leaching during the reaction causes a significant decrease in the reaction rate, well apparent already in the second run (6.2% versus 9.0% in the starting catalyst). 4. Conclusions Microporous hydrophillic poly-(N,N-dimethyl-acrylamide)-(p-styrylsulphon- ate)-(N,N'-methylene-bis-acrylamide) anionic resin undergo thorough function- alization by ion exchange with [Pd(NH3)4]2+, and are suitable precursors for polymer-supported palladium catalysts. Palladium catalysts based on these resins has been tested in the batchwise hydro- genation of cyclohexene at room temperature and 0.5 MPa. The catalytic activity A. Biffis et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 355-365 365 is found to depend on the crosslinking degree of the support and to correlate with its macromolecular structure, evaluated on the basis of a combination of bulk expanded volume measurements, ISEC and ESR spectroscopy.

Polymer-supported palladium catalysts based on microporouspolydimethylacrylamide-p-styryl-sulphonate-methylenebis(acrylamide) with 4 and 8% m/m crosslinking degree and various metal contents were prepared. The influence of the crosslinking degree on the metal distribution and on the final activity of the catalyst was studied by a combination of diverse physico-chemical techniques like X-ray microprobe analysis, inverse steric exclusion chromatography, powder X-ray diffraction, electron spin resonance, and catalytic tests.
