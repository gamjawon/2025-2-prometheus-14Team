Interdisciplinary Research Center for Catalytic Chemistry National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) 1-1-1 Higashi Tsukuba Ibaraki 305-8565 Japan Graphical abstract In this study, we report that selective aerobic oxidation of allyl phenyl ethers is attained by a Pd catalyst/polyoxometalate hybrid system to yield corresponding methyl ketones in water-enriched acetonitrile. The Pd(OAc)2/H5PV2Mo10O40 system exhibits higher conversions and yields of corresponding methyl ketone by Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ether as compared with the conventional PdCl2/CuCl2 system. The higher yields are attributed to the efficient re-oxidation of Pd0 to Pd2+ by H5PV2Mo10O40 using O2 as an oxidant as evidenced by electrochemical measurements. A reduced species of H5PV2Mo10O40 by Pd0 during the catalytic oxidation is revealed by UV–vis spectral measurements. The use of PdCl2 in place of Pd(OAc)2 in combination with [PV2Mo10O40]5− bearing tetraalkylammonium counter cations has also exhibited comparable conversions and product yields in the Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ethers. Para-substituted allyl phenyl ether derivatives are successfully oxidized in the Pd catalyst/polyoxometalate system to yield corresponding methyl ketones. The initial rate of products of para-substituted methyl ketones depended on the electronic effect of the substituents in which allyl phenyl ethers with electron-donating groups have accelerated the initial rate in the Pd catalyst/polyoxometalate system. Keywords Allyl phenyl ether Polyoxometalate catalyst Pd catalyst Hybrid catalysis Wacker-type oxidation 1 Introduction Aerobic oxidation reactions play an important role in organic transformations. Selective aerobic oxidation of ethylene into acetaldehyde is known as the Wacker oxidation, in which PdCl2 and CuCl2 are used as a catalyst and a re-oxidation mediator of Pd0, respectively, in an HCl aqueous solution [1–7]. The PdCl2/CuCl2 system has been applied for selective oxidation of terminal alkenes with long-chain alkyl, [8–10] aromatic [11], or cyclic [12] groups into corresponding ketones. However, the use of CuCl2 yields undesired by-products of chlorides in long-chain olefins [13,14]. The corrosive condition of the PdCl2/CuCl2 system can be a bottleneck for broad applications to other alkenes with functional groups. In the Wacker-type oxidation reactions, allyl ethers bearing two reactive sites (allyl and ether groups) are regarded as difficult substrates because the oxygen atom in the vicinity of an allyl group can potentially coordinate to a Pd center, which can result in multiple side reactions such as hydrolysis that yield alcohols [15–17]. To avoid the hydrolysis of ether groups, some modifications have been developed for the Pd catalyst systems [18–20]. Alternative oxidants, solvents, and organic media were explored for the selective oxidation of allyl ethers [19,21–24]. It should be a meaningful model to use allyl phenyl ethers, that are utilized as a raw material to gain versatile useful chemicals in electronic devices, as substrates for the Wacker-type oxidation [25]. For example, Fe2(SO4)3 (1.5 equiv) as an alternative oxidant was reported to oxidize allyl phenyl ether into corresponding ketone in good yield [23]. Similarly, Dess–Martin periodinane as an oxidant was also reported to oxidize allyl phenyl ether into corresponding methyl ketone [24]. In these reactions, oxidants generate large amounts of waste that are difficult to handle and remove from a product. As a consequence, it is required to develop environmentally benign catalytic systems for the Wacker-type oxidation of allyl ethers using molecular oxygen as an ideal oxidant. Polyoxometalates (POMs) are promising candidates for catalytic oxidation reactions using molecular oxygen as an oxidant [26–31]. POMs are composed of molecular metal oxide anions that exhibit attractive features of redox properties [31]. In addition, the selection of counter cations of POMs, such as metal or organic cations, enables the control of their solubility to be used in a wide range of solvents [32]. Notably, the phosphovanadomolybdates, H3+xPVxMo12−xO40 (x = 0–2), of the Keggin structure, which contains molybdenum and vanadium as addenda atoms, are reported to be efficient catalysts for aerobic oxidation and found to oxidize Pd0 to a Pd2+ species with molecular oxygen [28,33–35]. For example, PdSO4/H3+xPVxMo12−xO40 systems are used for the oxidation of but-1-ene to butan-2-one in the presence of O2 [34]. Furthermore, the Pd(OAc)2/H3PMo12O40/tetrabutylammonium acetate system was reported to selectively oxidize alcohols to aldehydes using O2 as an oxidant [35]. In this context, the combination of Pd catalysts and POMs as re-oxidation mediators is expected to be a potential system for the Wacker-type oxidation of allyl ethers into corresponding ketones. However, Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ethers has yet to be clarified in a Pd catalyst/POM system. Herein, we report the Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ether derivatives by a catalytic system that uses Pd catalysts and [PV2Mo10O40]5− with various cations as re-oxidation mediators. The yields of the corresponding methyl ketones were achieved up to 74% in the Pd(OAc)/H5PV2Mo10O40 system for the Wacker-type oxidation of allyl ethers using O2 as an oxidant. The yields were significantly improved compared with the conventional PdCl2/CuCl2 system. In this study, we have demonstrated that Pd catalyst/H5PV2Mo10O40 can act as an efficient catalytic system for the Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ethers under mild conditions. 2 Experimental 2.1 General Allyl phenyl ether, tetraethylammonium bromide, tetrabutylammonium bromide, tetrahexylammonium bromide, and tetradecylammonium bromide were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. Allyl 4-methoxy–, 4-fluoro–, 4-chloro–, and 4-bromophenyl ethers were synthesized according to literature procedure [36]. H3+xPVxMo12−xO40 (x = 0–2) were obtained commercially from Nippon Inorganic Colour & Chemical Co., Ltd. Tetraoctylammonium bromide and all palladium(II) reagents were purchased from Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corp. All solvents for catalytic reactions were used without further purification. Gas chromatography was performed using Shimadzu GC-2014 equipped with an FID equipped with a TC-1 column (GL Science, 0.25 mm ×30 m).1H NMR spectral measurements were performed on a JEOL JNM-ECX 400 spectrometer using acetophenone as an internal standard. UV–vis spectral measurements at RT were performed using a SCINCO UV–vis spectrophotometer (S-3100). Electrochemical measurements were recorded on a potentiostat/galvanostat instrument (HZ-7000, HOKUTO DENKO). Purified water (18.2 MΩ cm) was obtained from a Milli-Q system (Direct-Q3 UV, Millipore). 2.2 Synthesis of TA5PV2Mo10O40 (n = 2–10) Protons of H5PV2Mo10O40 were exchanged to tetraalkylammonium (TA) ions (n = 2–10) by a conventional method: Tetraalkylammonium bromide in methanol was slowly added to a methanol solution containing H5PV2Mo10O40 and stirred at RT. The formed precipitate was filtered and recrystallized in acetonitrile/ethanol solution to give TA5PV2Mo10O40. The obtained samples were characterized by FT-IR to confirm the structure and presence of TA ions. 2.3 General procedure for Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ethers A Pd catalyst (10 mol%) and a POM (3.0 mol%) re-oxidation mediator were added to the CH3CN/H2O (7:1, v/v) mixed solution containing allyl phenyl ether (0.10 M) at room temperature. The mixture was heated to target temperature and stirred for 16 h under ambient air. After the reaction, the mixture with biphenyl as an internal standard was quantified by GC-FID (Shimadzu, GC-2014). The temperature of the GC-FID program was kept 120 ℃ for 2 min, raised to 280 ℃ with a ramp rate of 10 ℃/min and then kept for 2 min. The same procedure was used for 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis but with the use of CD3CN/D2O (7:1, v/v) instead of CH3CN/H2O (7:1, v/v) as a reaction solution. Acetophenone was used as an internal standard for the quantification of products in the 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis. 2.4 UV–vis spectroscopic analysis of reaction mixture Pd(OAc)2 (10 mM), H5PV2Mo10O40 (3.0 mM) were mixed in 4.0 mL of MeCN/H2O (7:1, v/v) mixed solution containing allyl phenyl ether (0.10 M) at RT under air. The reaction solution (100 μL) was pretreated with a syringe filter (pore size: 0.20 μm) to remove undissolved solid and then diluting in 2.9 mL of MeCN for UV–vis spectral measurements. UV–vis spectra of the solution were performed before reaction and after 2 h reaction at 60 ℃. The control experiments for UV–vis spectroscopic analysis were conducted without the addition of Pd(OAc)2 or allyl phenyl ether in the reaction solution under the same procedure. 2.5 Electrochemical measurements Cyclic voltammograms of POMs (6.0–10 mM) and CuCl2 (6.0 mM) were measured in MeCN under Ar atmosphere. All cyclic voltammograms were measured in three cycles. Electrolyte: 0.10 M TBAPF6, W.E.: Glassy carbon, C.E.: Pt wire, R.E.: Ag/AgNO3. Scan rate: 100 or 50 mV/s. Temperature: RT. 3 Results and discussion We used various Pd salts as Pd catalysts and POMs as re-oxidation mediators for the Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ether in a CH3CN/H2O (7:1, v/v) mixed solution at 60 ℃ under air atmosphere for 16 h. Products were quantified by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and also confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Three products, phenoxyacetone (methyl ketone), phenoxypropan-1-al (aldehyde), and phenol were obtained from all the reactions (Table 1 ). Firstly, we have examined the effect of Pd catalysts in the Wacker-type oxidation reactions using H5PV2Mo10O40 as a re-oxidation mediator (Table1, entries 1–5). The use of PdCl2 in the Wacker-type oxidation reaction showed good conversion (87%) and afforded methyl ketone and aldehyde in yield of 51% and 13%, respectively (Table 1, entry 1). This result is consistent with previous studies that methyl ketones formed by Wacker-type oxidation reactions are typically favored in accordance with Markovnikov’s rule [5,37–40]. The highest conversion (100%) and methyl ketone yield (70%) were achieved by Pd(OAc)2 (Table 1, entry 2). The use of Pd(NO3)2 and Pd(OCOCF3)2 has also exhibited high conversions as well as Pd(OAc)2 in the Wacker-type oxidation reaction; however, the amount of phenol as the by-product was larger than that of Pd(OAc)2 (Table 1, entries 3 and 4). No products were obtained by PdCl2(PPh3)2 in the Wacker-type oxidation (Table 1, entry 5). This can be ascribed to the strong coordination of the PPh3 ligand to the Pd center preventing the coordination of the allyl moiety to Pd2+. Therefore, we demonstrate that a halogen-free catalytic system composed of Pd(OAc)2 and H5PV2Mo10O40 has exhibited selective oxidation of allyl phenyl ether into corresponding methyl ketone using O2 as an oxidant. Additionally, when the re-oxidation mediator of H5PV2Mo10O40 was replaced to H4PVMo11O40 and H3PMo12O40 (Table 1, entries 6 and 7), the conversions and methyl ketone yields gradually decreased in the Wacker-type oxidation reactions. The decrease of the conversions and methyl ketone yields may be reflected in the reduction potentials of the POMs that H3PMo12O40 has a lowest oxidation power (E 1/2 = +0.20 V vs Ag/AgNO3) among those POMs (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary materials). In comparison with the higher conversion and methyl ketone yield by the combination of PdCl2 and H5PV2Mo10O40, the use of PdCl2 and CuCl2, the conventional Wacker catalysts, results in a low conversion (34%) with 19% of methyl ketone yield in the Wacker-type oxidation reactions (Table 1, entry 8). The result demonstrates that the conversion and product yields are significantly improved by the use of H5PV2Mo10O40 in the Wacker-type oxidation reactions. Additionally, the increase of CuCl2 concentrations has suppressed the conversion to 28% (Table 1, entry 9), suggesting that CuCl2 may disturb the coordination of the allyl moiety to Pd2+. This also indicates the advantage of H5PV2Mo10O40 as a re-oxidation mediator for the oxidation of Pd0 to Pd2+. The enhancement of the re-oxidation process can be explained by the difference in reduction potentials between H5PV2Mo10O40 and CuCl2. The reduction potential of H5PV2Mo10O40 (E 1/2 = +0.43 V vs Ag/AgNO3) is higher than that of CuCl2 (E 1/2 = +0.18 V vs Ag/AgNO3), which is determined by electrochemical measurements in MeCN (Fig. S2). A blank test was also examined by the combination of PdCl2 and H5PV2Mo10O40 in the absence of O2. The conversion was dramatically suppressed to 34% under argon atmosphere (Table 1, entry 10), indicating that O2 was indispensable for the Wacker-type oxidation reactions. To gain insight into the catalytic cycle of the Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ether, the effects of reaction temperature on the conversions and product yields were investigated using the Pd(OAc)2/H5PV2Mo10O40 system as shown in Fig. 1 . The results revealed that high conversions of allyl phenyl ether were attained within the range of 30–70 ℃. The highest yield for methyl ketone was obtained to be 74% when the reaction was performed at 30 ℃. The yields of methyl ketone and aldehyde decreased with increase in temperature, whereas the phenol yield increased. This result agrees with the fact that hydrolysis of ether moieties is generally facilitated with execution at high temperature [41]. When the reaction was performed at 80 ℃, black precipitates derived from Pd0 nanoparticles were observed in the solutions, resulting in a low conversion (41%). Thus, the results indicate that the Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ether by the Pd(OAc)2/H5PV2Mo10O40 system is accelerated at low temperatures and competed with phenol production derived from the hydrolysis of ether moieties at high temperatures. We have also measured the UV–vis spectral changes to monitor intermediates formed during the Wacker-type oxidation reactions in the catalytic system of Pd(OAc)2/H5PV2Mo10O40 (Fig. 2 ). The reaction solution containing Pd(OAc)2, H5PV2Mo10O40, and allyl phenyl ether exhibited a characteristic absorption band around 720 nm at initial reaction time and after 2 h at 60 ℃ (Fig. 2a), which was not observed on the reaction solution in the absence of the Pd catalyst or allyl phenyl ether. This suggests that the characteristic absorption band around 720 nm is derived from the reduced species of H5PV2Mo10O40. The characteristic absorption band was also observed in a separate experiment in which hydroquinone, a reductant, was added into H5PV2Mo10O40 in MeCN (Fig. 2b), indicating the formation of [PVVVIVMo10O40]6− (POMred). Thus, these results clearly indicate that the formed species in the reaction solution is attributed to POMred. As POMred is observed in the catalytic reactions, the rate-determining step could be involved in the oxidation of POMred by molecular oxygen in the Pd(OAc)2/H5PV2Mo10O40 system for the Wacker-type oxidation reactions. According to previously reported literature, [6,42] the catalytic cycle in the Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ether using the Pd/POMs system is displayed in Scheme 1 . The Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ether by Pd2+ results in the formation of Pd0 that is then oxidized by [PVV 2Mo10O40]5− (POMox) to regenerate Pd2+. The Reduced POM, which is assigned to [PVVVIVMo10O40]6− (POMred) by the cyclic voltammograms in Fig. S1, reacts with O2 to produce POMox. Based on the results in Table 1 and UV–vis spectra in Fig. 2, the use of H5PV2Mo10O40 of can prevent from the formation of Pd nanoparticles, resulting in the high conversions and methyl ketone yields in the Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ether. We have also investigated the influence of the counter cations of POM on the Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ether because the cation–POM interaction is known to be crucial to control their properties [19]. We have employed tetraalkylammonium (TA) cations with different alkyl chain lengths (n) as counter cations of [PV2Mo10O40]5− to examine the effect of the counter cations. TA5PV2Mo10O40 (n = 2–10) were prepared by a typical method of cation exchange and characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra (Fig. S3). Unexpectedly, Pd(OAc)2/TA5PV2Mo10O40 (n = 6) exhibited low conversions in the Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ether (Table 2 , entry 1). After the reaction, a black precipitate was observed in the solution, indicating insufficient re-oxidation of Pd0 to Pd2+ in the combination of Pd(OAc)2 and TA5PV2Mo10O40 (n = 6). On the other hand, the PdCl2/TA5PV2Mo10O40 (n = 6) system showed a relatively high conversion (93%) and afforded methyl ketone (56%) and aldehyde (15%) with a higher yield (Table 2, entry 2) compared with that of obtained from the PdCl2/H5PV2Mo10O40 system (Table 1, entry 1). In the case of PdCl2/TA5PV2Mo10O40 (n = 6) system, no black precipitate was observed after the reaction, suggesting efficient re-oxidation of Pd0 to Pd2+. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of yield and conversion in the use of PdCl2/TA5PV2Mo10O40 (n = 6) was also investigated during the Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ether, and the highest conversions and yields were obtained at 60 ℃ (Fig. S4). Meanwhile, it was found that the alkyl chain lengths (n) of TA cations has less affected the conversions and product yields in the PdCl2/TA5PV2Mo10O40 (n = 2–10) (Table 2, entries 3–7). Thus, these results demonstrate that the combination of Pd sources with POMs bearing alternative counter cations is critical for the Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ether. Substituent effects of allyl phenyl ether were investigated for the Wacker-type oxidation in the PdCl2/TA5PV2Mo10O40 (n = 6) system (Fig. 3 a). The corresponding methyl ketones quantified by1H NMR yielded in the reactions using para-substituted allyl phenyl ether derivatives (X = H, OMe, F and Cl) as substrates (Fig. S5). Fig. 3b shows the time courses of the corresponding methyl ketones obtained in the reactions. The initial rates for the production of methyl ketones were calculated from the slopes and determined to be 3.74 × 10–5 M min–1 for H, 4.53 × 10–5 M min–1 for OMe, 2.54 × 10–5 M min–1 for F and 2.46 × 10–5 M min–1 for Cl. An allyl phenyl ether derivative having an electron-donating group (OMe) exhibited the highest initial rates as compared with those having electron-withdrawing groups (F and Cl). The initial rates of the Wacker-type oxidations were dependent on the Hammett parameters [43] of the substituents of the allyl phenyl ethers (Fig. 3c). The Hammett plots obtained for the para-substituted allyl phenyl ether derivatives showed a negative slope (ρ = –1.18) as shown in Fig. 3c. The results demonstrate that the initial rates lineally depend on the σp value of the substituents. Thus, the use of allyl phenyl ether derivatives having electron-donating groups can accelerate the Wacker-type oxidation in the PdCl2/TA5PV2Mo10O40 (n = 6) system. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have found that the Pd(OAc)2/H5PV2Mo10O40 system successfully catalyzed the Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ether, which is regarded as a difficult substrate that has two reactive sites, into corresponding methyl ketone in good yield (74%) using molecular oxygen as an ideal oxidant at low temperature (30 ℃). The yield of methyl ketone obtained in the Pd(OAc)2/H5PV2Mo10O40 system is higher than that in the conventional PdCl2/CuCl2 system for the Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ether. The electrochemical measurements of H5PV2Mo10O40 and CuCl2 in MeCN revealed that efficient re-oxidation of Pd0 to Pd2+ by H5PV2Mo10O40 resulted in a high conversion and a yield for the Wacker-type oxidation. A reduced species of H5PV2Mo10O40 observed during the catalytic reaction was confirmed by UV–vis spectral measurements. Para-substituted allyl phenyl ether derivatives are also oxidized to yield corresponding methyl ketones in the PdCl2/TA5PV2Mo10O40 (n = 6) system. The Hammett plots indicate a substituent effect that substrates with electron-donating groups have enhanced the initial rates for Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ether derivatives. Finally, the use of [PV2Mo10O40]5− bearing appropriate counter anions as re-oxidation mediators and Pd catalysts are key features in the selective oxidation of allyl phenyl ethers under mild conditions. Thus, we expect that the combination of Pd catalysts with POMs can be applied to various selective oxidation reactions using O2 as a green oxidant in synthetic and catalytic chemistry.

        "dc:description": "In this study, we report that selective aerobic oxidation of allyl phenyl ethers is attained by a Pd catalyst/polyoxometalate hybrid system to yield corresponding methyl ketones in water-enriched acetonitrile. The Pd(OAc)2/H5PV2Mo10O40 system exhibits higher conversions and yields of corresponding methyl ketone by Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ether as compared with the conventional PdCl2/CuCl2 system. The higher yields are attributed to the efficient re-oxidation of Pd0 to Pd2+ by H5PV2Mo10O40 using O2 as an oxidant as evidenced by electrochemical measurements. A reduced species of H5PV2Mo10O40 by Pd0 during the catalytic oxidation is revealed by UV–vis spectral measurements. The use of PdCl2 in place of Pd(OAc)2 in combination with [PV2Mo10O40]5− bearing tetraalkylammonium counter cations has also exhibited comparable conversions and product yields in the Wacker-type oxidation of allyl phenyl ethers. Para-substituted allyl phenyl ether derivatives are successfully oxidized in the Pd catalyst/polyoxometalate system to yield corresponding methyl ketones. The initial rate of products of para-substituted methyl ketones depended on the electronic effect of the substituents in which allyl phenyl ethers with electron-donating groups have accelerated the initial rate in the Pd catalyst/polyoxometalate system.",
