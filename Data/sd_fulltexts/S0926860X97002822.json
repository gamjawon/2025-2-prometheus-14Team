Kevword.~: Sol-gel; :t-NiMoO4 stabilisation: Isobutane oxidative dehydrogenation Although the preparation of metal oxide catalysts gcnerally implies the precipitation in basic media, for the Ni-M(~O system several additional procedures have been proposed 11,2]. For both Co and Ni molyb- date two phases can be observed at normal pressure [3] but tor NiMoO4 only one phase is stable at room temperature. Specifically, both phases are monoclinic with space group C2/m. The c~.-phase, stable from room temperature up to 650' C, presents the structure of o-CoMoO4 [4] with molybdenum in a distorted octahedral site. The/4-phase, stable between 650 and 250 C, presents the structure of cr-MnMoO4 [5] with molybdenum in a distorted tetrahedral site. The inverse transition of the metastable 3-phase at above 250'C leads to an -prime phase. The observed differences between or- and c~-prime phases are attri- *Corresponding author.

The ~- and/3-phases are among the most active and selective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of light hydro, carbons. Particularly for propane activation 161, the intrinsic activity of NiMoO4 is greater lbr the high temperature .;J-phase, since better alkene yields are obtained [7,8]. On the other hand, the :J-phase is metastable at room temperature and thus it is indust- rially less viable to avoid the inverse transition it must be kept above 250C. In order to stabilise the 3-phase. some authors [%101 have proposed to use excess of nickel but in this way the combustion reaction of light alkanes becomes competitive relative to the dehydro- genation reaction.

Tempesti et al./Applied Catalysis A.\" General 166 (1998) L259-L261 and Co molybdate catalysts where the metal oxides obtained are homogeneously dispersed in the silica matrix. The following procedures are the results of several attempts carried out under various experimen- tal conditions, using different starting materials, such as, Si(OMe)4, Si(OEt)4 and Si(OEt)3(CH2)3 NH(CHz)2NH2. (a) (Mo/Ni 1: 1) Methanol (2 ml) and subse- quently Si(OMe)4 (3.3 ml) were added dropwise, under vigorous stirring, to a water solution (4 ml) containing (NH4)6Mo7024.4H20 (0.396g) and Ni(NO3)2.6H20 (0.652 g), at room temperature (10:1 : 1 Si/Mo/Ni atomic ratio). After the addi- tion of catalytic amounts of NH4F (200:1 Si/F ratio), gelation occurred in ca. 15 rain, giving a pea-green transparent gel. The gelled solid was aged under vacuum at 3OC for 16 h, becoming opaque. Finally, the gel was heated in an oven at 550 or at 675 (20 h) giving a yellowish green powder. (b) (Mo/Ni 1:1 in the presence of a bidentate nitrogen ligand): Si(OEt)3(CH2)3NH(CH:)2NH2 (3 ml) was added to a solution containing 0.652 g of Ni(NO3)2.6H20 in MeOH (2 ml), which turned violet. Then the solution was added with Si(OMe)4 (3.3 ml) and ammonium molybdate (0.396g): further addition of the solution of ammonium fluoride caused gelation in a few minutes. The product was aged and heated as in (a). (c) Mo/Co 1/1: The procedure was the same as described for Ni. The catalytic activity of both 3-NiMoO4 and c~- CoMoO4 catalysts have been tested continuously in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane which is known to be particularly reactive. Specifically for SiO~ supported NiMoO4 prior to use the stabilisation of z3-phase at room temperature has been confirmed by IR and XRD techniques (Fig. l(a) and (b) Fig. 2). Catalytic runs were performed in the range 420- 460~C using a quartz tubular reactor 50 cm long with an internal diameter of 8 mm. The catalyst (0.5 g) was diluted with silicon carbide ( 10 g) of the same size in order to prevent severe temperature gradients. The partial pressure of isobutane and oxygen in the gas feed was 15 and 7%, respectively, using helium as diluent with a total feed ranging from 3 to 10 h The catalytic results show that the isobutene formed is extremely reactive.
