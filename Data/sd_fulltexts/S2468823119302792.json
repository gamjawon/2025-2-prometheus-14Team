Graphical abstract Characteristics of polymeric- and electronic structure of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) responsible for the photocatalytic activity were analyzed with oxidation reaction of nitrogen monoxide (NO) and various kinds of spectroscopies. The photocatalytic activity per surface area was increased with increasing the preparation temperature up to 520 °C, and was decreased above 520 °C while the visible light absorbance and the relative surface area was increased with the preparation temperature up to 650 °C. Laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) showed that the content of cyano group connected with tri-s-triazine unit in g-C3N4 increases with increasing the preparation temperature and that g-C3N4 with higher activity per surface area contained smaller amount of cyano group. Additionally, the degree of polymerization and the planarity of carbon-nitride layer possibly contributed for formation of mid-gap levels that increases the number of unpaired electron. The formation of the mid-gap level was not effective for the photocatalytic activity, but rather deactivated g-C3N4. Keywords Carbon nitride Photocatalysis Mid-gap level Polymeric structure LDI-MS 1 Introduction Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a “sustainable” functional material that is composed of very common elements, C, N, and H. g-C3N4 and the related materials have been studied as a visible light responsible photocatalyst for environmental purification or water splitting [1–4]. Also, the applications for a catalyst for organic synthesis [5–8], a photoelectric converter [9–11], an electrode material of fuel cell or battery [12–14], a hydrogen storage material [15,16], a fluorescent sensor [17,18], etc. have been investigated. Especially, the application for photocatalytic water-splitting is well investigated recently. The utilization of the environmentally benign materials, g-C3N4, for the environmental protection and for the renewable-energy production seems a natural flow. g-C3N4 that is recently well-studied is synthesized by the condensation (heating) of nitrogen-rich organic compounds (e.g. melamine, cyanamide, or dicyandiamide) at 500–650 °C. The g-C3N4 is actually not the stoichiometric C3N4, and the nonstoichiometric chemical composition is represented as C3N4+xHy (0 < x < 0.6, 0 < y < 2) in most cases. The hydrogen atoms contained in g-C3N4 belong to amino groups remained in the structure. The stoichiometric g-C3N4 was very difficult to be prepared [19,20], and is hardly prepared by heating the nitrogen-rich organic compounds simply. In this paper, the series of nonstoichiometric g-C3N4 is used, and is described as g-C3N4 for simplicity. The band gap of g-C3N4 is 2.6–2.8 eV, which depends on the condensation temperature [21]. g-C3N4 absorbs blue light along with UV light by the inter-band transition and thus appears yellow. The thermal stability and the resistances to acid and alkalis of g-C3N4 are very high, considering that the material is organic. g-C3N4 is not decomposed below 500 °C in air. Most of acids and alkalis does not change the composition of g-C3N4 at room temperature. g-C3N4 is scarcely dissolved with organic and inorganic solvent. These stabilities are favorable for the practical applications, whereas they make modification of g-C3N4 difficult. Photocatalytic activities of pristine g-C3N4 for water splitting and environmental purification were much lower than those of metal-oxides based photocatalyst [22,23]. One of the causes for the low activity of pristine g-C3N4 was a small specific surface area (ca. 8 m2 g−1). Therefore, several methods to enlarge the surface area of g-C3N4 were studied [7,8,24–26]. We also succeeded in improving the photocatalytic activity for degradation of nitrogen monoxide (NO) by increasing the specific surface area (ca. 64 m2 g-1) with alkaline-hydrothermal treatment at a temperature between 90–130 °C [22]. The improvement of the activity was ascribed to the increase in the surface area; however, the activity per unit surface area was not improved. The loading of metal nano-particle and the formation of composites with metal oxides and carbon materials are investigated to offset or improve the low photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4. For example, the loading of platinum and ruthenium enhanced the photocatalytic water splitting [4]; the loading of silver nanocrystallites significantly increased the adsorption capacity and the photocatalytic degradation activity for methylmercaptan [23]; the composite with TiO2, Bi2WO6, or graphene oxide improved photocatalytic water purification activity [27–29]. While the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 has been improved by the assist of other materials, the improvement of very nature of pristine g-C3N4 was left behind since the knowledges about the relations between the activity and the structure (bulk and surface) of pristine g-C3N4 was lacked. Additionally, although g-C3N4 is composed by stacking of carbon-nitride sheet that is formed of 1-dimensional carbon nitride polymer, the polymer structure of g-C3N4 and the mechanism of photocatalysis by the polymer were not well analyzed. It is expected that the accumulation of those knowledge would help to produce novel g-C3N4 with higher activity. In this paper, we prepared g-C3N4 at different condensation temperatures, and analyzed relations among the bulk structure, the polymer structure, the spectroscopic properties and the photocatalytic activities, in order to uncover the factors for improving the activity of pristine g-C3N4. However, the evaluation of photocatalytic activity was performed only in a light irradiation condition where enough amount of light was irradiated to avoid light rate-limiting. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of g-C3N4 and HT-g-C3N4 g-C3N4 was prepared by condensation of melamine (Wako pure chemicals ind. Ltd., special grade reagent), and HT-g-C3N4 was prepared by alkaline hydrothermal (HT) treatment of g-C3N4 as written in foregoing paper [22]. The simplified procedure is shown in Fig. 1 . Melamine (30 g) was packed in an alumina crucible with a cover, and was heated for 2 h in air at the condensation temperatures between 450 and 650 °C. The heating rate was controlled to ca. 10 °C min−1. After cooling down to room temperature, the products were well ground in an agate mortar. The obtained g-C3N4 was denoted as g-C3N4(T), where T denoted the condensation temperature. The specific surface area of g-C3N4 was increased by the alkaline-hydrothermal treatment as following. A 1.0 g portion of g-C3N4, 90 cm3 of deionized water and 0.40 g of NaOH (0.11 mol L−1) were mixed in a pressure tight vessel (100 cm3) of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The vessel was covered with a stainless steel jacket, and was heated at a constant temperature between 110 °C for 18 h while the mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer. After the vessel was cooled down to room temperature, the solid products was collected by centrifugation and was washed with 40 cm3 of deionized water 3 times. The product was dried at 80 °C for 24 h, and was finally well ground. The samples after the alkaline hydrothermal treatment was denoted as HT-g-C3N4(T), where T denoted the condensation temperature of g-C3N4 used. The characterizations of g-C3N4(T) and HT-g-C3N4(T) were performed with X-ray diffractometry (XRD) with Cu-Kα radiation (Rigaku, Smartlab) and UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Shimadzu, UV-3600). The specific surface areas of the solid samples were determined by BET method with N2 adsorption at 77 K (Bel Japan, BELSORP-MAX). The chemical compositions were analyzed by elemental analysis (CE instruments, EA1110). Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were recorded at 77 K (JEOL, JES-TE300) in the presence of adsorbed water and oxygen. Laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) was applied to the structural and compositional characterization of g-C3N4 as a polymer. About 1 mg g-C3N4 powder sample was attached on a stainless steel target plate, and LDI-MS pattern was observed using a JEOL JMS-S3000 Spiral-TOFMS (JEOL). The details of the instrument’s configuration are described in the references [30,31]. Nd:YLF laser (349 nm) was applied for generating fragment ions, which were accelerated at 20 kV to be detected with MS. The spectrometer was calibrated with a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) standard (Polymer Laboratories). 2.2 Evaluation of photocatalytic NO oxidation rate Photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 was analyzed with NO oxidation in gas phase [22,32]. A 200 mg portion of the g-C3N4(T) or HT-g-C3N4 (T) was suspended in deionized water (1.5 cm3) and the suspension was dispersed on a glass plate (width 5 cm and length 10 cm), and the plate was dried in air at 50 °C for 24 h. The plate with g-C3N4 was placed in a flow reactor with a borosilicate glass window. Test gas (ca. 1.0 ppm of NO in air, relative humidity 6% at 25 °C) was passed through the reactor at a flow rate of 1.0 L min−1. Visible-light of W-type fluorescent lamps (Toshiba, FL-10W) was irradiated to the reactor at 6000 Lx. Long-pass filter (Nitto jushi kogyo Co., N-169; the cut position was 394 nm; the transmittance below 380 nm was less than 0.07%) was used for removing ultra violet light (Fig. S1). The number of photons with wavelength between 380 and 500 nm was 3.0 mmol h−1 at the plate, while the numbers below 380 nm was calculated to be less than 0.001 mmol h−1. The cut position and the irradiance were adopted in order to avoid light rate-limiting. The volume fraction of NO and NO2 were monitored with a chemiluminescence-type NOx detector (Monitor Lab., ML-8940A). The NO oxidation ratio (%) was defined as Eq. (1) during the illumination for 1 h. (1) NO oxidation ratio ( % ) = ∫ ϕ N O i − ∫ ϕ NO ∫ ϕ N O i × 100 where φNO i is the supply volume fraction of NO, and φNO is the NO volume fraction at the reactor exit. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of g-C3N4 and HT-g-C3N4 The formation of g-C3N4 was analyzed with XRD by changing the condensation temperature of melamine (Fig. 2 ). In the XRD pattern of the product obtained by condensation of melamine at 450 °C, peaks of melamine were not observed, and the diffraction pattern was different from the pattern of tri-s-triazine (melem, C6H6N10) reported by Jurgens et al. [33]. Since the chemical formula based on elemental analysis (C6N6.16N9.68) was close to that of tri-s-triazine, it is inferred that the product is an organic molecular crystal of tri-s-triazine that has different orientation from the literature because of different condensation period. The product obtained at 490 °C provided the diffraction peak at 27.4° along with the peaks of organic molecular crystal. In the pattern of the products obtained at 520 °C and more, only the peaks of g-C3N4 were observed. The strong diffraction peak at 27.4° (d = 0.326 nm) is due to the inter-layer distance of stacking of carbon nitride layers as in graphite. As shown in the inset of Fig. 2, the position of the main peak was shifted to larger 2θ and the peak became sharper by increasing the condensation temperature above 550 ℃. This indicates that the planarity of carbon nitride sheet was increased and the inter-layer distance was decreased at above 550 °C. The diffraction peak at 13.1° (d = 0.68 nm) was assigned to one of the structural periods in the carbon-nitride layer. The weak diffraction peaks between 13.1 and 25°, which are also due to the periodical structure in the inner layer, did not change significantly. This suggests that the structure of 1-dimensional polymer of tri-s-triazine unit [34] was maintained at the condensation temperatures below 650 ℃. By the alkaline hydrothermal treatment, the diffraction peak was slightly sharpened, while the peak positions of g-C3N4 were not changed. g-C3N4 absorbs visible light as well as ultraviolet light (Fig. 3 (a)), suggesting that g-C3N4 are possibly activated with visible light. Increasing with the condensation temperature, the absorption increased and the absorption edge shifted to longer wavelength. One of the reasons why the absorption was increased is the increase in the porosity of g-C3N4. The shift of absorption edge means decreasing of the band gap of g-C3N4. The band gaps calculated from Tauc plot (Fig. S2) were shown in Fig. 3(b). The band gap of g-C3N4 decreased monotonically with increasing the condensation temperature between 450 and 650 °C. The decrease of band gap was probably due to increase in the interaction of π-orbitals of tri-s-triazine units associated with the decrease in the inter-layer distance of carbon nitride layers [21]. In the spectra of g-C3N4 obtained at higher temperatures, especially for g-C3N4(650), tailing of absorption at longer wavelength was observed. This suggests that mid-gap levels were formed by the change in the polymer structure or the laminated structure of g-C3N4. The specific surface areas of g-C3N4 prepared at the different condensation temperatures were plotted in Fig. 4 . For the samples before the hydrothermal treatment, the surface areas of products prepared at the temperatures from 450 to 550 °C were not so different. However, the surface area was increased when the condensation at above 550 °C was applied. This was due to the formation of pores by the partial decomposition of carbon nitride, since the weight loss was involved. For the each condensation temperature, the surface area was significantly enlarged by the hydrothermal treatment. This increase was due to the formation of pores by the hydrolysis of less-ordered carbon nitride [22]. The collection yield in the hydrothermal treatment was analyzed to evaluate the degree of polymerization of carbon nitride qualitatively. In the hydrothermal treatment, parts of network of carbon nitride polymer were decomposed into small fragments, which were not collected by centrifugation and were washed away. The collection yield increased with increasing the condensation temperature (Fig. 5 ) from 450 to 600 °C. This suggest the polymerization of carbon nitride proceeded more effectively at 600 °C. The collection yield decreased at above 600 °C. It is inferred that the polymer network was partially decomposed. 3.2 Photocatalytic NO oxidation with HT-g-C3N4 The photocatalytic activities of g-C3N4 and HT-g-C3N4 were evaluated with oxidation of NO into NO2 and NO3 − under visible light. A typical profile of NO oxidation with HT-g-C3N4 was shown in Fig. S3. The amount of NO2 formed was smaller than that of NO oxidized, because a major part of NO oxidized was changed into NO3 −, which was adsorbed on the surface. The details about the photocatalytic NO oxidation under visible light, such as mass balance, wavelength dependence, self-oxidation, and effect of hydrothermal treatment, were discussed in the previous paper [22]. Fig. 6 (a) shows the relation between the NO oxidation ratio and the condensation temperature of g-C3N4. Here, the NO oxidation means the oxidation into both of NO2 and NO3 −. For g-C3N4 without hydrothermal treatment, the NO oxidation ratio was not so different from each other although g-C3N4(600 and 650) had higher specific surface areas than g-C3N4(450–550). For HT-g-C3N4 the NO oxidation ratio was increased with increasing condensation temperature up to 550 °C, and was decreased above 550 °C. The trend was different from the trend of the specific surface area shown in Fig. 4. Also, in many papers treating photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4, the condensation temperatures between 520 and 550 °C were selected. These suggest that g-C3N4 condensed at 520–550 °C has higher activity than g-C3N4 condensed at lower or higher temperature ranges regardless of the specific surface areas. The photocatalytic activities of g-C3N4 and HT-g-C3N4 on NO oxidation per unit surface area were shown in Fig. 6(b). Since the excess amount of photon was irradiated and the NO oxidation rates were not saturated, the activity per area were significant as an index. The activity per area of g-C3N4 without hydrothermal treatment revealed the maximum at 490 °C, and was decreased significantly above 520 °C. The activity per area of HT-g-C3N4 revealed the maximum at 520 °C. These results suggest that the condensation at around 520 °C forms some structures suitable for photocatalytic NO oxidation and that the condensation at higher temperatures deactivates the surface or the bulk of carbon nitride. The activities per area of g-C3N4 prepared at the condensation temperatures between 450 and 550 °C were higher than those of HT-g-C3N4 prepared at the corresponding condensation temperatures. This suggests that activity of newly formed surface accompanied with the increase of surface area by the hydrothermal treatment is lower than the former surface. On the other hand, the activities per area of g-C3N4 prepared at above 550 °C were slightly increased by hydrothermal treatment. It is inferred that the activity of the surface of g-C3N4 prepared at high temperatures is originally low and is removed by the hydrothermal treatment. The polymer structure of g-C3N4 was analyzed by LDI-MS to discuss the relation with the photocatalytic activity. Fig. 7 (a) is a LDI-MS pattern of g-C3N4(550). A series of tri-s-triazine based units, H+(C6H6-xN10)(CN)x, was observed at m/z = 219.1, 244.1, 269.1, and 294.1 (x = 0, 1, 2, and 3). The unit substituted with a CN group provided a strongest peak (x = 1, m/z = 244.1). Also, some kinds of series of units composed with a dimer of tri-s-triazine H+(C12H9-xN19)(CN)x, where m/z = 420.2, 445.2, 470.2, and 495.2 (x = 0, 1, 2, and 3), and a trimer of tri-s-triazine H+(C18H12N28)(CN), where m/z = 621.2, were observed. Additionally, small peaks of melamine based unit H+(C3H6-xN6)(CN)x, where m/z = 127.0, 152.0, 177.1, 202.1, and 227.1 (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4), and a unit containing a melamine molecule and a tri-s-triazine, H+(C6H5N10) (C3H4-xN5) (CN)x where m/z = 328.1, 353.1, 378.1, 403.1, and 428.1(x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), were observed. These results indicate that g-C3N4(550) is a polymer with backbone of tri-s-triazine and terminal of cyano group or melamine. Although the structure of g-C3N4 has been often introduced as “perfect g-C3N4” in which each tri-s-triazine unit is connected to three tri-s-triazine units with bridging nitrogen atoms (ternary amine), the result of LDI-MS clearly revealed that the g-C3N4 prepared by condensation of melamine is composed of 1-dimensional chains of NH-bridged tri-s-triazine units as reported by Lotsch et al. [34]. In the LDI-MS pattern of HT-g-C3N4(550) (Fig. 7(b)), a series of tri-s-triazine based units containing amino group, H+(C6H6-xN10)(CN)xNH2 (m/z = 236.1, 261.1, and 286.1), were observed along with the peaks observed for g-C3N4(550). Also a series of melamine based units containing amino group, H+(C3H6-xN6)(CN)xNH2 (m/z = 169.1, 194.1), was observed. These results suggest that tri-s-triazine unit or melamine unit in g-C3N4 was partially ammonolyzed in the hydrothermal treatment. However, the peaks of ammonolyzed tri-s-triazine and melamine units were small. This indicates that the main polymer structure of g-C3N4 was maintained in the hydrothermal treatment. The LDI-MS patterns of g-C3N4 with the different condensation temperatures were analyzed to clarify the change in the polymer structure. The content ratios of fragments were significantly different among the samples with the different condensation temperatures. Fig. 8 (a) shows the relation between the condensation temperature and the relative peak intensities of the series of tri-s-triazine based unit, H+(C6H6-xN10)(CN)x where x is the number of hydrogen atoms substituted with cyano groups. For g-C3N4(450) and (490), the contents of tri-s-triazine without CN group (x = 0) and tri-s-triazine substituted with one cyano group (x = 1) were larger than those of tri-s-triazine substituted with more than one cyano group (x = 2, 3, and 4). For the sample prepared at the temperatures above 490 °C, the content of unit with x = 0 was significantly decreased. The content of unit with x = 1 became the maximum at 550 °C. On the other hand, the contents of units with x = 2, 3, and 4 increased with increasing the temperature up to 650 °C. These results indicates that the substitution with cyano group proceeds gradually with increasing the condensation temperature. The changes in the contents of tri-s-triazine units were also confirmed in the LDI-MS patterns of HT-g-C3N4 (Fig. 8(b)), although the changes with the condensation temperature were smaller than those for g-C3N4. The relative peak intensities of tri-s-triazine (x = 0) of HT-g-C3N4(450 and 490) were significantly smaller than those of g-C3N4(450 and 490). On the other hand, the relative peak intensities of tri-s-triazine substituted with 2–4 cyano groups (x = 2, 3, and 4) of HT-g-C3N4(600 and 650) were smaller than those of g-C3N4(600 and 650). These results suggest that the hydrothermal treatment decomposes the polymer containing a smaller amount of cyano group in g-C3N4 prepared at lower temperatures and the polymer containing a larger amount of cyano group in g-C3N4 prepared at higher temperatures. Assuming that the polymer containing a smaller amount of cyano group has higher photocatalytic activity, the above changes in the hydrothermal treatment is well accorded with the changes of photocatalytic activity per unit surface area (Fig. 6(b)). Unpaired electrons formed in HT-g-C3N4 were analyzed with ESR at 77 K (Fig. 9 (a) and (b)) to evaluate the relation with the photocatalytic activity. In each of the ESR spectrum of HT-g-C3N4(450 to 650), a signal with Lorentzian-type curve (g = 2.004) was observed. The signal was originated from an unpaired electron on the carbon atom of the π-conjugated system, which was reported for polyacetylene and polyacenic semiconductive materials [35,36]. The symmetry of the signal was better than that of graphite, since g-C3N4 is fine particular and low conductive material. The g value was higher than that of free electron (2.0023), graphite (2.0026), polyacetylene (2.0026), and polyacenic materials (2.002–2.003). The higher g value could be due to the presence of N atoms in the π-conjugated system. The ESR signal was double-integrated to be converted to the ESR peak area, which was plotted in Fig. 10 against the condensation temperature. The peak area without light irradiation increased with increasing the condensation temperature between 450 and 520 °C, and only slightly decreased above 520 °C. The increase of the peak area with heating temperature had studied in the heat-treatment of polyacenic materials (<700 °C), where dangling bonds (structural defects) formed by heat-treatment increased the number of unpaired electron in the π-conjugated system [36,37]. Analogically, it is considered that the increase in the peak area for HT-g-C3N4 from 450 to 520 °C is due to increase in the amount of defects of HT-g-C3N4. The kind of defects are unclear at present. However, the cyano group substituted of tri-s-triazine is one of the candidates for the defects. The peak widths of HT-g-C3N4(490–550) were approximately constant, whereas narrowing of the peak was observed for HT-g-C3N4(650). The narrowing of the peak had also studied in the heat-treatment of polyacenic materials [37]. The exchange interaction of π-electrons narrowed the ESR peak, and the peak width depended on the length of π-conjugated system. The constant peak width of HT-g-C3N4(490–550 °C) suggests that the length of π-conjugated system was constant in the condensation at the temperature between 490 and 550 °C. The narrowing of the peak of HT-g-C3N4(650) is inferred to be due to the increase in the exchange interaction caused by the decrease of interlayer distance. The signal intensities for all HT-g-C3N4 were increased by irradiating visible light (λ=420 nm) (Fig. 9(b)). The signal increased by light was not decreased at 77 K in an hour after stopping the light irradiation, whereas the signal intensity was quickly returned to the initial intensity at room temperature. It is suggested that the reversible electron transfer from N2p band (valence band) to C2p band (conduction band) was induced by the absorption of visible light [4]. Neither peaks of active oxygen species nor nitrogen species were observed. The increment of the ESR peak area with light irradiation (△ in Fig. 10) significantly increased with increasing the condensation temperature up to 520 °C, and HT-g-C3N4(520) showed the largest increment among the sample tested. The increment degreased only slightly above 520 °C. Since the photocatalytic activity significantly decreased above 520 °C (Fig. 6(a) and (b)), the increment of ESR signal intensity seems not directly related to the photocatalytic activity. It is suggested that the unpaired electron formed by the visible light irradiation was not effective for the photocatalytic NO oxidation reaction. In the temperature range from 550 to 650 °C, where the deactivation of g-C3N4 was observed, the following changes were suggested: • The planarity of carbon-nitride sheet was increased, and the inter-layer distance was decreased. • The density of mid-gap level was increased. • The content of cyano group was increased. • The exchange interaction of π-electrons was increased. It is speculated that the layered structure of g-C3N4 with higher planarity and smaller inter-layer distance was formed in the condensation at higher temperature as the results of polymerization and the formation of cyano group. These changes possibly formed mid-gap levels that increases the number of unpaired electron, although those electron seemed not effective for the photocatalytic activity. 4 Conclusions The temperature range between 520 and 550 °C, which is often applied for the condensation of g-C3N4, is well-balanced temperature in which the relatively higher specific surface area can be obtained without the deactivation of g-C3N4 by the changes in polymeric- and in electronic-structure. It is expected that highly active g-C3N4 would be obtained if g-C3N4 with much larger surface area, lower content of cyano group, and lower degree of polymerization, is synthesized. The clarification of causality among the formation of cyano group, the planarity and the inter-layer distance of carbon-nitride sheet, the density of mid-gap level, and the photocatalytic activity is also an important future work.

Laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) showed that the content of cyano group connected with tri-s-triazine unit in g-C3N4 increases with increasing the preparation temperature and that g-C3N4 with higher activity per surface area contained smaller amount of cyano group. Additionally, the degree of polymerization and the planarity of carbon-nitride layer possibly contributed for formation of mid-gap levels that increases the number of unpaired electron. The formation of the mid-gap level was not effective for the photocatalytic activity, but rather deactivated g-C3N4.",
