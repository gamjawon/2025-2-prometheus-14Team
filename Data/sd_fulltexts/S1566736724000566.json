The modified SCO-30 catalyst from this method exhibits an optimized thickness of cobalt-rich amorphous layer enriched with oxygen vacancies. This modification enhances the trifunctional catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an alkaline electrolyte. Importantly, the perovskite's structure remains unchanged during the surface engineering process. These findings underscore cationic defect engineering as an effective strategy for the rational design of high-performance electrocatalysts, showcasing potential applications in diverse electrochemical processes.

Achievement of this goal largely relies on the successful exploration of electrocatalytic materials. The electrocatalysts containing Pt-group metal (PGM) elements, i.e., Pt/C, IrO2, and RuO2 show excellent activities in oxygen electrocatalysis and water electrolysis. However, these PGM-based electrocatalysts suffer from high costs due to their scarcity and poor stability under electrochemical environments, especially when exposed to anodic conditions, which significantly limit their widespread commercialization [9–13]. Few of the cost-effective, non-PGM electrocatalysts exhibit satisfactory electrochemical performance, requiring large overpotentials by the slow charge transfer kinetics and complex electrochemical process. Therefore, it is crucial to develop low-cost, efficient, and stable precious metal-free electrocatalytic materials for oxygen and water electrocatalysis, accompanying OER, oxygen reduction reaction ORR, and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). ABO3-type perovskite oxides have attracted significant attention as one of the most promising electrocatalytic materials because of their low cost, abundance, and flexible structure [14–16]. It is reported that the electrocatalytic activities of some perovskite catalysts have been significantly improved with suitable defect engineering [17–20]. Zhu et al. proved that the creation of surface oxygen vacancies and the small amount of Fe4+ species in the A-site of cation deficiency play a pivotal role in the enhancement of ORR and OER activity in La1-xFeO3-δ perovskites [21]. Liu et al. reported a scalable one-pot strategy to regulate the defects at the A site in perovskite LaMnO3.15 by introducing urea, effectively activating surface lattice oxygen and improving its redox performance [22]. Guo et al. reported the preparation of perovskite oxides with enhanced electrocatalytic activity by selective dissolution of A-site cations in La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 to regulate A-site cation deficiency [17]. Furthermore, it is previously established that the formation of a nano-amorphous layer on the surface of the catalyst significantly contributes to improve its electrocatalytic activity [23,24]. For example, Shao et al. reported two orders of activity enhancement in OER in amorphous Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ nanofilms [25]. According to the correlation between the binding free energy of O* and OH* on the surface of perovskite oxides and their OER activity, SrCoO3-δ (SCO) is considered to be one of the most theoretically optimal materials [26]. However, their actual OER catalytic performance is not satisfactory. Previous studies reported that segregation of Sr element was observed on the Sr-containing perovskite surface [27–29], resulting in the diminished electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) by an evolution of inactive Sr2+ on the catalytic surface. To prevent this unintentional deactivation of surfaces in SCO, elaborating surface engineering is essential to achieve its highly active, intrinsic electrocatalytic activities of SCO, especially by controlling the distribution and chemical states of Sr ions in a various range. We previously developed the method for selective dissolution of elements at the A-site of perovskites by simple etching in diluted acids. In this study, we prepared SrCoO2.52 (SCO-raw) using the sol-gel method, which is chosen as a starting material for further surface modification by surface defects engineering. By the simple immersion of SCO-raw in citric acid solution, enrichment of active Co sites and formation of oxygen vacancies was acquired by following the selective dissolution of Sr ions at the surface. Furthermore, these engineered SCO perovskites show the cobalt-rich, amorphous layer on the surface. These surface changes optimally tune the electronic structure with the reduced surface coordination number and enlarged ECSA, thus leading to significantly improved electrocatalytic performance of SCO in OER, ORR, and HER. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Reagents Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, AR, 99%), strontium nitrate (Sr(NO3)2, AR, 99.5%), citric acid(C6H8O7·H2O, AR, 99.5%), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (C10H16N2O8,AR,99.5%) and carbon black (Vulcan XC-72) were purchased from Macklin. Potassium hydroxide (KOH, metal basis, 99.99%) was purchased from Aladdin. Deionized water (DI) with a resistance of 18.25 MΩ cm−1 was used in all the experiments. All the above chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. 2.2 Synthesis of SrCoO2.52 powder SrCoO2.52 (denoted as SCO-raw) powder was synthesized by sol-gel method. Briefly, the mixture of Sr(NO3)2: Co(NO3)2 6H2O: citric acid: EDTA with a molar ratio of 1:1:3:1 was successively added into the ultrapure water and put in an oil bath at 75 °C until completely dissolved. After that the pH of the solution was adjusted with ammonia, and a quantitative amount of PEG-400 was added. Keep heating and stirring until the purple viscous colloid is formed, and then transfer to a drying oven to obtain a fluffy product. The product was then collected and fully ground into powder in a mortar. This sample was then put into an alumina crucible of the tube furnace, and calcined in air at 850 °C for 2 h to obtain SCO-raw powder. 2.3 Surface engineering of SCO-raw The surface engineering of SCO-raw powder was carried out through acid etching. In brief, SCO-raw powder was immersed in 0.1 M citric acid solution and stirred (350 rpm) at room temperature under the protective atmosphere of argon (Ar). After different reaction times, the samples were taken out and centrifuged. Then the obtained precipitates were ultrasonically purified with ultrapure water and dried in an oven at 60 °C for standby. The treated SCO samples were respectively termed SCO-15, SCO-30, SCO-60, and SCO-180, according to their processing time. 2.4 Characterization of SCO perovskite samples X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to determine the phase and crystallinity of the SCO powders on Empyrean, an X-ray diffractometer manufactured by PANalytical in the Netherlands. The diffraction patterns were recorded at a scanning angle (2θ) ranging from 5° to 80°. The surface chemical compositions and element valence states were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a K-Alpha+ spectrometer, equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source. The binding energies were calibrated with reference to the C 1 s peak at 284.6 eV and the data was analyzed using Avantage software. In order to obtain the surface morphology of the catalysts, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was tested on a JSM-7800F, and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEM-F200. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP–OES) was carried out on an Avio 200 instrument to determine the elemental composition of the samples, while the elemental distribution of the catalysts was observed using X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). 2.5 Preparation of the working electrode The working electrode was prepared through a controlled drop-casting approach on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode (0.07065 cm−2, ALS Research Instrumentation). Before the test, the GC electrode was pre-polished with alumina suspension on the suede and rinsed with ultrapure water. The catalysts were mixed with carbon black in a mass ratio of 1:1. Briefly, 5 mg of catalyst and 5 mg of carbon black were dispersed in 1 mL of absolute ethanol solution with 50 μL of 5 wt% Nafion solution. The above mixture was continually sonicated for 15 min to ensure a homogeneous solution. Next, a 5 μL aliquot of the catalyst ink was spread uniformly on the glassy carbon electrode and dried under an infrared lamp for OER and ORR tests, and a 10 μL aliquot was used for the HER test. The obtained loadings of the OER and ORR catalysts were 238.1 μg cm−2 and 476.2 μg cm−2 for the HER catalyst. In the process of preparing the ink and electrode, the SCO catalysts showed good wettability with water. No obvious change has been observed in the hydrophilic properties of the catalysts after the surface treatment. 2.6 Electrocatalytic performance test of catalysts The electrocatalytic performance of catalysts was tested using a three-electrode electrolytic cell with 1 M KOH solution at room temperature. At least three duplicate samples have been tested for the measurements to ensure good repeatability. The working electrode was a GC rotating disk electrode with a coated catalyst, whereas Hg/HgO (1 M KOH) and platinum (Pt) wire were utilized as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The potential values shown in this work were converted with reference to reversible hydrogen electrodes (RHEs), as described in eq. 1, and IR-corrected to compensate the effect of ohmic resistance. (1) E vs . RHE = E vs . Hg / HgO + 0.098 V + 0.0592 × pH Prior to the measurement, the electrolyte solution was bubbled with O2 or Ar for approximately 30 mins and maintained under an O2 or Ar atmosphere throughout the OER and ORR or HER test. The electrocatalyst was activated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at least five times, at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 until reproducible CV curves were achieved. During the HER and OER test, the rotating disk electrode was constantly rotated at 1600 rpm to get rid of the bubbles. The HER polarization curves were obtained from 0 to −0.6 V vs. RHE, and OER polarization curves were recorded from 1.2 to 1.8 V vs. RHE, using linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 5.0 mV s−1. To obtain Tafel plots, the polarization curves were replotted as the overpotential (η) to the logarithm of current density (log|J|). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz under an AC voltage of 5 mV, and at −1.3 V vs. Hg/HgO for HER and 0.7 V vs. Hg/HgO for OER. The chronopotentiometry (CP) tests were performed at a constant current density of 5 mA cm−2 to evaluate the stability of the catalysts. It was worth mentioning that the CP test of OER was carried out using the catalyst loaded on nickel foam as the working electrode. The electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl) was measured by the CV method. The CV curves were collected at different rates of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mV s−1 in the region where no faradic current was observed. The halves of the difference between the positive and negative current densities at the scanning potential center were plotted relative to the scanning rate, where the slope represented the double-layer capacitance. In the ORR measurements, the polarization curves were obtained through LSV at the speed of 900, 1200, 1600, 2000, and 2500 rpm, with a scan rate of 5.0 mV s−1. The transfer electron number (n) was calculated by the following Koutechy-Levich (K-L) eq. 2: (2) 1 J = 1 J K + 1 J L = 1 nkF C 0 + 1 0.2 nF D 0 2 / 3 v − 1 / 6 C 0 ω 1 / 2 Where J is the measured current density, Jk and JL are the kinetic and diffusion-limiting current densities respectively, n is the electron transfer number, k is the rate constant of oxygen reduction, F is the Faraday constant (96,485C mol−1), C0 is the saturation concentration of oxygen in 1 M KOH solution, ω is the rotating rate (rpm), D0 is the diffusion coefficient of oxygen, and ν is the viscosity of electrolyte solution. 3 Results and discussion The SCO-raw perovskite oxide with bulk phase was immersed in the diluted citric acid solution for 15 to 180 mins at 25 °C. During this etching process, Sr2+ was selectively dissolved in the solution. The selectivity of our defect engineering method for Sr ions is enabled by utilizing the difference in the bond strength between Sr − O and Co − O in the SCO perovskite oxides. The bond energy of Sr − O and Co − O calculated in our previous work was 102.25 and 118.92 kJ mol−1 respectively [30], resulting in the facile detachment of Sr from the surface. Due to the continuous leaching of large Sr2+, the cation defects were introduced on the surface of SCO where the crystal structure of perovskite gradually collapsed and became an amorphous structure. During the optimizing surface treatment conditions, we observed that at a higher concentration of citric acid (more than 1.0 M), the perovskite structure completely collapsed and transformed into the main phase of Co3O4, which showed reduced electrocatalytic performance (Supporting Information, Fig. S1). The XRD pattern displayed in Fig. 1 reveals that the synthesized powder was well-crystallized and had a SCO phase perovskite structure (PDF#40–1018). It should be pointed out that there may be a small amount of Co3O4 phase (PDF#78–1969) in the synthesized powder because its main peak overlaps with the diffraction peak of SCO (Fig. S1). We also used SEM to characterize the surface morphology of the SCO samples as shown in Fig. S2. In the SCO-raw image, a few tens of nanometer-sized small particles were attached to the surface of large particles (with a size of about several hundred nanometers). EDS map analysis reveals that the constituent elements of the small particles are Co and O (Fig. S3). TEM images (Fig. S4) further exhibited that the small particles are crystals with lattice fringes at a spacing of 0.29 nm, which is consistent with the (220) plane of Co3O4. The SEM and TEM analysis are consistent with the structural information, acquired from the aforementioned results of XRD analysis, confirming the Co3O4 phase originates from the smaller particles. The XRD results of the treated SCO samples are consistent with that of the pristine SCO, implying the perovskite matrix structure was well retained in the treatment process. Also, the width of diffraction peaks at 28.5° and 43.8° from treated SCO samples are prominently increased. We propose that these peaks broadening originates from the selective dissolution of Sr2+ on the surface, resulting in abundant oxygen vacancies and microscopic stress by a lattice distortion [31]. It could be observed that the amount of Co3O4 on the catalyst's surface was reduced in the treated SCO samples. More distinctive images for surface reconstruction through acid leaching were acquired using TEM analysis, as shown in Fig. 2 . In contrast to the smooth surface of SCO-raw catalysts, the surfaces of SCO-15, SCO-30, and SCO-60 catalysts were serrated and roughened. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images in Fig. 2e clearly demonstrate the good crystallinity in SCO-raw powder structure. Interestingly, the amorphous layer appears on the surface and the thickness of the treated SCO-15, SCO-30, and SCO-60 catalysts were measured as ∼2.3 nm, ∼6.9 nm, and ∼ 10.1 nm, respectively. This is proportional to the duration of acid leaching, suggesting that the acidification treatment could induce structural changes in the intrinsic SCO crystal. The composition of elements was measured by the EDS map analysis, where the results are presented in Fig. 2i, Fig. S5, and Table S1. The Sr/Co ratio on the surface of the treated SCO catalysts is significantly lower than that of the SCO-raw surface, demonstrating that the inactive Sr2+ at the A site of the SCO-raw perovskite can be selectively etched from the surface, which is responsible for the formation of a cobalt-rich amorphous shell. The OER performance of the SCO catalysts was tested in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, where the LSV curves shown in Fig. 3a reveal that the treated SCO catalysts exhibited overall better OER performance in comparison with the SCO-raw catalyst. The SCO-30 catalyst required a much lower onset potential of 1.38 V vs. RHE for the OER than SCO-raw (1.55 V vs. RHE). The overpotentials for SCO-15, SCO-30, SCO-60, SCO-180, SCO-raw catalysts, and Ir black at 10 mAcm−2 are ∼349, 336, 366, 371, 397 and 343 mV, respectively. Specifically, the SCO-30 catalyst exhibited excellent OER activity, which is superior to the Ir black (343 mV). All the corresponding Tafel plots are presented in Fig. 3b, where the Tafel slopes of the treated SCO catalysts clearly seem to be smaller than that of SCO-raw (83.8 mVdec−1), which may imply faster OER kinetics. The value of Tafel slope on the SCO-30 (70.2 mV dec−1) is very close to the lowest one on the SCO-60 (69.5 mV dec−1). The Tafel slope mainly reflects the kinetic properties of the catalytic reaction, i.e., the relationship between the reaction rate and the electric potential. A smaller Tafel slope usually corresponds to a higher reaction rate, but it does not necessarily mean that the catalyst performs better. Moreover, the treated SCO catalysts manifested a smaller polarization resistance than that of SCO-raw in EIS analysis (Fig. 3c). This indicates that the treated SCO catalysts show smaller charge transfer resistance, which is conducive to the OER reaction. For a fair comparison of the OER catalytic activity in these electrocatalysts, the current density at 1.6 V vs. RHE (with IR correction) was normalized to the oxide mass loading in order to calculate the mass activity (Fig. 3d). Remarkably, the SCO-30 catalyst delivered the mass activity of 88.40 mA mg-1 oxide, which is about 5.84 times higher than that of SCO-raw (15.14 mA mg-1 oxide) and 1.43 times than Ir black (61.67 mA mg−1). In addition, Fig. 3e shows that the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of SCO-30 (51.49 mF cm−2) is much higher than the SCO-raw (6.14 mF cm−2), which is consistent with the SEM and TEM analysis, indicating that the etching of Sr2+ increased the surface area through exposing more active sites. The ECSA is a key factor influencing the performance of OER, which is related to the number of active sites on the catalyst surface. The value of ECSA can be evaluated by the Cdl measured in the non-Faraday region of the CV scan [32,33]. The Cdl was measured through the CV method and the corresponding CV curves are shown in Fig. S6. The above data proved that the surface treatment in SCO perovskite has dramatically improved the OER activity, especially the SCO-30 catalyst. We also evaluated the OER stability of the SCO-30 catalyst by a chronopotentiometry test, which was performed at a current of 5 mA cm−2 for 43 h. Strikingly, the SCO-30 catalyst shows excellent durability with a marginal performance degradation of 2%. To further demonstrate the utilization of the treated SCO catalysts as bifunctional oxygen electrodes, the ORR activity was also evaluated in 1 M KOH solution. Fig. 4a revealed the LSV curves of the SCO and Pt/C catalysts loaded on the RDE at 1600 rpm. Among all the studied SCO samples, SCO-30 catalyst has depicted most positive onset potential of 0.987 V and the highest limiting current of 3.54 mA cm−2, proving a comparable performance to Pt/C (0.939 V, 3.50 mA cm−2). On the basis of the RDE data collected under various electrode rotating speeds, the K-L plots of SCO-raw and SCO-30 at 0.6 V (vs. RHE) are shown in Fig. 4d. The number of electrons transferred calculated from the slopes of K-L plots are 3.19 in SCO-raw and 3.85 for SCO-30, which confirm a more thorough ORR pathway toward H2O in SCO-30 catalyst. The enhanced ORR performance and faster kinetics of SCO-30 than the SCO-raw might be attributed to the surface defect. The selective etching of Sr2+ at the A-site of SCO-30 promoted the formation of oxygen vacancies, which is considered to be effective for the O2 adsorption and electron transfer process. For further application of the surface-engineered SCOs as bifunctional catalysts in the water electrolyzer, the HER performance was tested in 1 M KOH. Fig. 5a shows the overpotentials of SCO-raw, SCO-15, SCO-30, SCO-60, and SCO-180 at 10 mA cm−2 which are measured to be 469, 321, 337, 377, and 368 mV, respectively. Hence confirming the significantly improved HER catalytic activity of the treated SCO catalysts in comparison with the SCO-raw catalyst. The treated SCO catalysts deliver much lower charge transfer resistance in HER than SCO-raw, as shown in Fig. 5b. The enhancement of HER performance in the surface-engineered SCO catalysts was further investigated by calculating the mass activity (Fig. 5c). At −0.4 V (vs. RHE), the treated SCO-15 catalyst exhibited improved mass activity, which is ∼10.36 times higher than that of SCO-raw. The ECSA data shown in Fig. S7 depicts the Cdl value of SCO-raw and SCO-15 catalysts to be 6.04 and 17.25 mF cm−2, respectively, implying the increased ECSA for the HER in SCO-15 catalyst. In addition, SCO-15 has exhibited good stability as shown in Fig. 5d, where no significant performance degradation was observed during the 35-h test. After the long-term test, the SCO-15 catalyst retained its original morphology and the surface thickness almost remained the same (Fig. S8), along with no obvious deconstruction phenomenon observed after the stability test. The HER performance is comprehensively affected by factors such as overpotential, mass activity, electrochemical impedance, ECSA, and stability. Based on the above analysis, we could conclude that SCO-15 had the best HER activity among all SCO samples. To shed light on the source of the extraordinary electrocatalytic performance of the treated SCO catalysts, XPS analysis was carried out to unveil the surface elemental compositions and the electronic structure. As summarized in Table 1 , the molar ratio of Sr/Co is about 1.89, suggesting that the surface of the SCO-raw catalyst is dominated by Sr element. In the treated SCO catalysts, the Sr on the surface got selectively dissolved resulting in a reduction of Sr content to 78–87% of Co. This result is in good agreement with EDS analysis, confirming the exposure of more active sites on the surface of the SCO catalysts after acidification. Fig. 6a shows the O 1 s spectra of SCO-raw, SCO-15, SCO-30 and SCO-60 catalysts, which could be deconvoluted into four characteristic peaks of lattice oxygen species (O2−, ∼529.5 eV), highly oxidative oxygen species (O2 2−/O−, ∼530.7 eV), hydroxyl groups or the surface-adsorbed oxygen (−OH/O2, ∼531.5 eV), and adsorbed molecular water (H2O, ∼532 eV) [17,34,35]. Previous studies have reported that the highly oxidative oxygen species formed on the surface of catalysts are closely related to the oxygen vacancies which are favorable for catalytic reactions [6,36,37]. Apparently, the increased concentration of oxygen vacancies in the treated SCO catalysts is considered to be one of the important factors that can contribute to electrocatalytic performance improvement [21,30,38,39]. In addition, XPS spectra of Co 2p (Fig. 6b) demonstrated that a higher oxidation state of Co ions (more than 3+) is possibly generated on the surface of the treated catalysts, leading to the enhancement of electrophilicity of adsorbed oxygen, thereby effectively promoting the electrocatalytic reactions [34,40]. It is noteworthy that more oxygen vacancies and high oxidation states of Co ions were generated with the increasing treatment duration, which conflicts with the electrocatalytic activities. Initially, the OER, ORR, and HER activities improved with the slight acid leaching in citric acid solution, benefiting from the collective contribution of the aforementioned factors including a number of active sites and oxygen vacancy concentration. When over-treated for a longer time, catalytic activity was gradually attenuated which may be caused by engraving of the active Co species, resulting in the existence of optimal surface etching duration in acids. The ICP–OES results displayed in Table 2 depict that the molar ratio of Sr/Co in SCO-30 (0.92) has been slightly decreased than SCO-raw (1.07) due to the selective etching of Sr2+. In case of longer treatment time (more than 30 min) in diluted citric acid, the ratio of Sr/Co was almost retained. Another important reason to be considered is that the thickening of the amorphous layer in longer treated SCO catalysts (than the optimized duration) may also result in the hindered electron transport and diffusion of reactants and products, leading to the reduction of catalytic activity [41]. 4 Conclusions In this work, the surface defect engineering of perovskite materials was developed as a promising route to prepare efficient trifunctional catalysts for OER, ORR, and HER. We successfully demonstrate the selective etching of the A-site enriched Sr2+ on the surface of SCO-raw material, simultaneously maintaining the stability of the perovskite crystal structure by treating it with 0.1 M citric acid. The electrocatalytic performance of the optimized SCO-30 catalysts exhibited significant enhancement with the lower overpotential of 336 mV for OER and 377 mV for HER, the onset potential of ORR was 0.922 V and the electron transfer number was 3.84. This catalytic performance improvement originates from the increased concentration of oxygen vacancies and the exposure of higher oxidation states of Co ions (more than 3+) toward the electrolytes. Furthermore, the best electrocatalytic activity is also attributed to the optimized thickness of a Co-rich amorphous layer on the surface-treated SCO catalyst. We hope this work could provide an effective approach for designing perovskite electrocatalysts and contribute to develop the bifunctional catalyst in rechargeable metal-air batteries and water-splitting systems for future applications.

        "dc:description": "This study presents a straightforward chemical approach to induce cationic surface defects on SrCoO3-δ (SCO) perovskites by selectively etching a-site Sr elements on the surface. The modified SCO-30 catalyst from this method exhibits an optimized thickness of cobalt-rich amorphous layer enriched with oxygen vacancies. This modification enhances the trifunctional catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an alkaline electrolyte. Importantly, the perovskite's structure remains unchanged during the surface engineering process. These findings underscore cationic defect engineering as an effective strategy for the rational design of high-performance electrocatalysts, showcasing potential applications in diverse electrochemical processes.",
