Hangzhou 310027. China Received 24 October 1996; received in revised form 8 January 1997; accepted 8 January 1997 Abstract An artificial neural network (BP network) is applied to design a VSbWSn (P, K, Cr, Mo)/SIAL catalyst lbr acrylonitrile synthesis via propane. The conversion of propane and selectivity of acrylonitrile can be calculated as functions of the catalyst components by the BP network to be trained. After training, the network can simulate the catalytic system very well. If one takes the conversion of propane and selectivity of acrylonitrile as the two sub-objectives, a model for this catalytic system can be given as: Max(y1 = Xc3), Max(y2 = SACN), y = F(W, Xin), 0 <_ )'l ~< 1.0, 0 <_ Y2 < 1.0. A better catalyst could be found through optimization for propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile. The best yield of acryhmitrile is 55.0%, which is higher than those reported in the literature. ~_~: 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction Various recent changes in the petrochemical market have created two incentives to improve current Acrylonitrile (ACN) technology based on propylene ammoxidation: (1) the increase in the propylene prices provides the economic driving force to evaluate alter- native lower cost feedstocks and (2) required new production capacities or substitution of old plants provides the opportunity to utilize new technology. *Corresponding author. Present address: Institute of Catalysis, Hangzhou University, Hangzhou, China. tThis work is supported by the National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China. The cost of propane feedstock is about 5-6 times less than the cost of propylene and thus the development of a process based on propane as the main material appears to be the more direct evolution of propylene ammoxidation process [1]: C3H8 + NH3 + 202 --~ CHzCHCN + 4H20 (H = - 151.13 kcal/mol). In recent years a large number of patents, mainly from BP/Sohio, have been published. But the best yield of ACN is 40.0% [2,3]. Some improvements of the catalyst are needed to increase the yield of ACN. Catalyst design largely depends on empirical and qualitative knowledge, rather than on theoretical and 0926-860X/97/$17.00 (tS 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. Pll S0926-860X(97)00063-X 184 Z-Y Hou et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 183-190 quantitative relationships. Therefore, artificial intelligence may be used for catalyst design. Several expert systems for catalyst development has been proposed. Banares-Alcantara et al. [4] describe DECADE (Design Expert for Catalyst Design) which selects catalysts and reaction conditions using a hybrid approach for knowledge representation, methods of solving problems, and knowledge abstraction. Dumesic et al. [5] used a kinetic model- ing approach for their catalyst design advisory program CATALYST II. ESKA proposed by Speck et al. [6] selects catalytic components, reaction conditions and standard catalysts. Kito et al. [7,8] developed INCAP (INtegration of Catalyst Activity Patterns) and the advanced version INCAP- Muse (INCAP for Multicomponent catalyst selec- tion) which both select catalytic components by integration of activity patterns for favorable catalyst functions needed for required reaction steps, and unfavorable functions, responsible for catalyzed side reactions. A system by Hu et al. [9] optimizes the composition, preparation procedure, and operat- ing conditions of basically known catalysts to achieve the desired selectivity in alcohol synthesis reactions. The IACES system by Sun and Li [10] selects operating parameters in the prepara- tion of supported catalyst. Recently a new system called ESYCAD (an Expert SYstem for Catalyst Design) is developed by Erich et al. [11]. It selects catalyst components and proposes reaction condi- tions on the basis of catalyst functions which are required for assumed elementary reaction steps leading to the desired products and that excludes materials with functions which catalyze undesired side reactions. In designing multicomponent catalysts, the syner- gistically generated catalytic functions have to be taken into consideration. This is especially the case for mixed oxide catalysts, since, while single-compo- nent oxides do not provide enough activity, mixed oxides can sometimes provide strong activity by a synergistic effect in mixing. It is also the case that such experimental data are scarce mainly because of combinative problems. Therefore when designing multicomponent oxide catalysts, we encounter the task of predicting better components. Because of the synergistic effect, the knowledge base in expert system cannot be written thoroughly. The above expert systems can only be used in the simple and thoroughly studied systems. 2. Application of neural network 2.1. Introduction of the neural network Neural network (also called artificial neural net- work) is a simple form of artificial intelligence. It is a simplified model of a human brain. It consists of a large number of nodes. The weight of each connecting line (W~j) denotes the strength of the function between the two nodes. A neural network can be divided into input layer, hidden layer(s) and output layer. An artificial neural network based on the error back propagation model is used because of its strong learning capability. As the activation transfer function, a sigmoidal function, which is the most frequently used, is adopted. If one gives a training set of known pairs of input data (properties of catalyst components, for instance) and output data (observed catalytic performance), the neural network calculates a set of output data from the given set of input data, and it iteratively adjusts its own network pattern by the back propagation algo- rithm so as to make the calculated output data as close to the given output data as possible. Thus, a trained network pattern may be compared to a 'function' representing the relation between the given input and output data. In catalysis, Kito et al. have reported that the acid strength of mixed oxides can be estimated by a neural network within probable experimental errors [12-14]. The neural network also has been successfully applied to the estimation of catalytic performance, such as the activity of a series of lanthanide oxides in the oxidation of butane and the selectivity to various products in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene on a series of promoted SnO2 catalysts [15-18]. The elements of this paper are: (a) Using the neural network to establish the catalyst system (getting the relations between the catalyst components and its activity). (b) Selecting the best neural network structure which can estimate the catalytic system well and at the same time with a moderate calculation speed. (c) Using the network trained as the objective subroutine of the optimization model, better catalyst components can Z.- g Hou et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 183- 190 185 be predicted after optimization. (d) Testing the opti- mized results and modifying the model. 2.2. Modeling of the catalytic system In the system mentioned above, under the same conditions in which the catalyst was prepared and tested, the activity of the catalyst is a \"function\" of the catalytic components. A simulator of a multi-layer back-propagation neural network was developed by using software. In the back-propagation network, the activation function for each of the network nodes is a sigmoidal function. The conversion of propane (Xc3) and selectivity of ACN (SAcN) can be taken to express the activity of the catalyst, as the output of the net- work. According to the experimental data, the catalyst component (atom number fractions of E K, Cr, Mo, V and the weight ratio of A1203/SIO2) can be the input of the network. In this case, parameters to characterize the neural network, i.e,, the number of hidden layers and the number of nodes in each hidden layer, were optimized through preliminary experiments. The opti- mized structural organization of the neural network is schematically shown in Fig. l. It can be seen from the figure that the BP network consists of two hidden layers. The first layer includes 20 nodes, and the second 12 nodes. After millions of times learning, the network was checked with the program development in advance. 2.3. Training and testing Using the optimized network, we take the experi- mental results as the training set (see Table 1). For further examination of the estimation ability, a more severe test was applied to the neural network by taking, as an example, a series of catalysts which are included in Table 2 (Catalysts 203, 207, 222, 231) as dummy for target catalysts. Then, the activities of the catalyst to be obtained on the excluded catalysts were calculated by substituting the corresponding input data in the trained network. After learning the others for 1 000 000 times, the tested results of the selected network are shown in Table 2. As shown, the observed results agree with the predicted results to within reasonable experimental error. Thus, this result indi- cates that the neural network estimates the catalysts activities with an accuracy similar to that in the experimental measurement, even when one of the catalyst was not included in the training set. So it can be seen from Table 3 that the selected network (shown in Fig. 1) is able to predict the rela- tions between the catalyst components and its reaction activity. After 5 000 000 times of learning, the network can simulate the experimental results very well (see Table 3). The conversion of propane and selectivity of ACN can be represented as \"functions\" of the catalyst components: XC3i --fl (Pi, Ki, Cri, Moi, A1203/SiO2i), (1) SACNi = f2 (Pi, Ki, Cri, Moi, A1203/SiO2,), (2) where the subscript (i) denotes the different catalyst, fl, f2 are very complex functions corresponded to the structure and simulator function of the network shown in Fig. 1. 2.4.

After five million times learning, the simulation result fitted very well with the tested results. But the first optimization round contains large errors (see Table 4Table 5). Bigger errors in the first round may be caused by the unsteadiness of the trained network, because the net- work is used to simulate and predict the relations between the changed catalyst components and its reaction activity. All of them are used in Eqs. (1) and (2), so a very small unsteadiness of the network would cause errors. The back propagation neural network is said to overfit the training set, bringing a sometimes rather large error after the training with too much iterations because of its strong learning cap- ability [ 19]. The neural network learns only significant Table 6 The optimization results (second round) features of the data in the early stage of training, but it attempts to fit all the data including possible errors in a later stage. In this study it was carefully checked, but we do not find it to be a problem [20]. So the results in first round were added into the training set and we let the network learn five million more times. Using the network which was trained once more, after optimiza- tion, the results are as shown in Table 6. From Table 7 it can be seen clearly the optimized results fits well with the tested results. The yield of ACN reached 43.0%. 3.2.

A BP network which consists of two hidden layers (the fist layer include 16 nodes and the second 12 nodes) can simulate their effects on the reaction results very well. According to the optimized results we prepared several catalysts (shown in Table 8). 4. Conclusion Thus, one can conclude that the artificial neural network can be applied to optimize the catalyst com- ponent. After two times of learning, optimizing and testing, the predicted results fit well with the experi- ment. By using the neural network to model and simulate the reaction system, we can optimize the catalyst component. The highest yield of ACN is 55 %, which is higher than those reported in the literature.

Present address: Institute of Catalysis, Hangzhou University, Hangzhou, China. An artificial neural network (BP network) is applied to design a VSbWSn (P, K, Cr, Mo)/SIAL catalyst for acrylonitrile synthesis via propane. The conversion of propane and selectivity of acrylonitrile can be calculated as functions of the catalyst components by the BP network to be trained. After training, the network can simulate the catalytic system very well. If one takes the conversion of propane and selectivity of acrylonitrile as the two sub-objectives, a model for this catalytic system can be given as:Max(y1=XC3), Max(y2=SACN), y= F(W,Xin), 0≤y1≤1.0, 0≤y2≤1.0. A better catalyst could be found through optimization for propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile. The best yield of acrylonitrile is 55.0%, which is higher than those reported in the literature.
