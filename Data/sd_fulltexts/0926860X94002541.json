Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, France Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60680, USA Received 12 May 1994; revised 15 September 1994; accepted 3 November 1994 Abstract The hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane and the isomerization of 2-methylpentane were studied over IRu bimetallic catalysts prepared using either HJCl, and RuCl, (Series A) or from Pt( NH,),( N03)* and Ru( NHs)&l, (Series B). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) studies showed that the catalysts prepared using the amine precursors were 100% bimetallic. Image defocussing studies suggest that approximately 20% of the particles prepared using the chloride precursors were monometallic. At temperatures at which only ruthenium is active (413 K), the formation of C, to C5 products was depressed over Pt-Ru bimetallic clusters. Tertiary-secondary carbon-carbon bond cleavage approaches that observed for ruthenium while secondary-secondary carbon-carbon bond cleavage is closer to that observed for platinum. The isomerization of 2MP at 493 K is representative of Pt-Ru activated dual sites since platinum is inactive at this temperature and ruthenium leads to extensive degradation of the molecule. The contribution of the cyclic mech- anism was obtained using 13C labelled species. A synergistic effect was observed for the catalysts prepared using amine precursors. This is explained by considering an increase in the number of Pt- Ru dual surface sites. Keywords: Bimetallics; Methylcyclopentane hydrogenolysis; Platinum-ruthenium catalysts 1.

Diaz et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 33-46 reaction. Additives such as oxides, chlorides, sulfides or alkali metals may also either promote or inhibit the catalytic activity of a particular metal. Changes which occur at the metal surface may be reflected by changes in the selectivity and/or the catalytic reactivity of the active phase. The choice of a suitable probe reaction to obtain detailed information regarding changes which may be occurring at the surface is desirable. The hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane (MCP) is very sensitive to metal dispersion [ l-31 and to variations in the electronic structure of the metal [ 41. These properties make it useful as a reaction probe in the study of demanding reactions. In addition, the hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane has been extensively used as a probe reaction because methylcyclopentane is the inter- mediate species in the isomerization process via the cyclic mechanism. The use of carbon- 13 labelled molecules to confirm the presence of this isomerization pathway is essential. Methylcyclopentane hydrogenolysis and 2-methylpentane isomeriza- tion proceed via the same intermediate species [ 11. The hydrogenolysis of MCP and the reactions of methylpentanes have been used to probe the surface structure of alumina supported Pt-Ru bimetallic catalysts [ 5,6]. The catalytic reactivity and selectivity of platinum and ruthenium are quite different for these two reactions [ 61. Ruthenium becomes active at lower temperatures (413 K) than platinum (493 K) in the hydrogenolysis of MCP. This makes it possible to perform studies on supported Pt-Ru bimetallic catalysts under conditions for which only the ruthenium is active. At 4 13 K, ruthenium can cleave carbon<arbon bonds whereas platinum shows essentially no hydrogenolysis activity in the MCP reaction. Ruthenium is therefore a metal which has a high intrinsic hydrogenolytic activity while platinum is not. The catalytic behavior of alumina supported Pt-Ru bimetallic clusters [5,6] never shows the same hydrogenolytic activity as monometallic ruthenium under conditions for which only ruthenium is active. The deep hydrogenolysis reactions which take place on the bimetallic samples are always less active compared to those observed for monometallic ruthenium at the same temperature. Thus, the formation of lower hydrocarbons, which is the most important feature of ruthenium, is appar- ently inhibited by the presence of platinum in the bimetallic catalysts [ 5,7]. Several studies have shown the importance of metal precursor-support interac- tions in the resulting surface properties of the bimetallic particles [ 8,9]. The aim of this study is to further probe hydrocarbon reactions (MCP hydrogenolysis and 2-methylpentane isomerization) on well characterized silica supported Pt-Ru bime- tallic clusters prepared from chloride and amine precursors. The results will be compared to those obtained on alumina supported Pt-Ru catalysts. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Both sets of catalysts were prepared in the Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Illinois at Chicago. A detailed description of the preparation procedure G. Diaz et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 3346 35 for this set of samples can be found in refs. [ 8,9]. A summary of the experimental procedure is presented here. Two different sets of precursors were used to prepare the supported bimetallic catalysts. The first set was prepared using H&C& * 6H20 and RuCl, * 3H,O and is denoted as Series A. The second series of bimetallic catalysts was prepared using Pt( NH,),( N03) 2 and Ru( NH,)&. It is denoted as Series B. The silica support used was Cab-0-Sil, M-5 (Cabot, Champaign, IL). The BET surface area of the support was 200 m*/g with an average pore diameter of 14 nm. The nominal composition of the catalysts was varied from pure Pt/SiO, to pure Ru/SiO,. For the case of the pure chloride precursors, three bimetallic catalysts samples were prepared with a Pt/Ru atomic ratio of 3.0, 1.0 and 0.33. The total metal loading was 0.3 mmol of metal/g of support (3-5% by weight). They were prepared by coimpregnation using the incipient wetness technique. The catalysts were dried at room temperature prior to reduction in flowing hydrogen for two hours at 723 K. The Pt/Ru atomic ratio for the catalysts prepared using the amine precursors was 1 .O, 0.5 and 0.087 with a total metal loading of 0.15 mmol of metal/g of support. Accurate metal loadings were obtained using induced cou- pled plasma (ICP) . The catalysts were reduced in flowing hydrogen at 673 K. 2.2. Physical characterization Total dispersion measurements on both series of catalysts were performed using carbon monoxide chemisorption. The results reported in this work are reported in refs. [ 8,9]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on Series A using a Jeol 100 CX microscope in order to obtain particle size distributions. In addition to these measurements, the study of the state of alloying of supported bimetallic clusters was performed through the use of an image defocussing technique devel- oped by Yacaman et al. [ lo]. On the other hand, extensive energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) studies were performed on Series B using a VG-501 scanning transmission electron microscope. The results of these studies have been reported elsewhere [ 8,9]. 2.3. Catalytic reactions The hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane (MCP, Fluka reagent grade) was studied at 413 K, 433 K and 493 K depending on the reactivity of the sample. A differential flow reactor under atmospheric pressure of hydrogen was used. The 2- methylpentane-2-13C reaction was performed at 493 K. Details regarding the prep- aration of the labelled hydrocarbon have been reported elsewhere [ 111. Small amounts of hydrocarbon (5 ~1) were used for each run. They were injected into the reactor feed at constant pressure using a catharometer which was inserted in the flow line (before and after the reactor). The output signal closely approximated that of a square wave pulse. Samples were removed directly from the gas phase 36 G. Diai et al. /Applied Caral.ysis A: General 124 (1995) 3346 and analyzed by gas chromatography. Total conversion was kept below 10% and about the same for all samples. All catalysts were reactivated at 673 K in hydrogen prior to performing sequential catalytic runs. 3. Results 3.1. Physical characterization Metal dispersion and average particle size as determined from chemisorption [ 93 and TEM measurements for the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts prepared using the chloride precursors are summarized in Table 1 a. Total metallic dispersions (Pt + Ru) were low. The ruthenium monometallic catalyst showed the lowest dispersion with a particle size of 15.8 nm. On the other hand, there was reasonable agreement between the TEM and the chemisorption measurements. For the bime- tallic samples prepared from chloride precursors an increase in the particle size with increasing ruthenium content was observed. Fig. 1 shows an electron micro- graph of a selected area in a bimetallic sample of Series A (Pt/Ru = 1 .O) . The catalysts prepared using the amine precursor had dispersions which were considerably higher than those obtained using the chloride precursor (Table 1 b) . Particle sizes ranged from 1.0 nm for Ru/SiO, to 2.5 nm for Pt/SiO,. Contrary to observations made using chloride precursors, catalysts prepared using amine pre- cursors showed that an increase in the platinum content resulted in an overall increase in the average particle size. Particle sizes for the Pt-Ru bimetallic clusters prepared using the amine precursors ranged from 2.0 nm for Pt/Ru = 1 .O to 1.4 nm for Pt/Ru = 0.087. In order to verify the formation of supported Pt-Ru bimetallic particles on Series A, the image defocussing technique was used. It is possible to use the defocussing Table 1 Dispersion and mean particle size of Pt-Ru/SiO, catalysts Pt (at.-%) RU (at.-%,) PtlRu 70D d Chem.

Electron micrograph of a selected area in a bimetallic catalysts of Series A (Pt/Ru = 1 .O) method to determine whether or not the metallic phases are forming an alloy [ lo]. A series of defocussing experiments were performed on Pt/SiO, and Ru/SiO, (Series A) in order to measure the displacement in the dark field image for each of the metals under different defocussing conditions. Three omposition ranges were established for the purpose of classifying the supported Pt-Ru bimetallic clusters. These omposition rangesare designated as Pt-rich, Pt-Ru and Ru-rich. This qualitative designation only implies that the displacement observed in the dark field image resembles that of platinum (Pt rich), ruthenium (Ru rich), or that the displacement lies clearly in between that observed for the monometallic phases ( Pt-Ru) . The dark field image displacement observed for the bimetallic particles covered a rather broad range of displacements, suggesting that the composition of the particles was not homogeneous. It is important to note that only particles on these catalysts that have a diameter of 5.0 f 2.5 nm have been successfully analyzed using this technique. A small number of very large particles were identified as consisting solely of ruthenium using EDXS measurements [9]. These particles were not taken into account in the analysis. The results are summarized in Table 2. Table 2 Percentages of Pt.

Approximately 80% of the particles analyzed ( 150) were bimetallic. A typical dark field image showing the displacement obtained under defocussing conditions for a bimetallic Pt-Ru particle is shown in Fig. 2. These results which show the presence of Pt-Ru particles were cross checked against EDXS measurements [ 91. A particle-by-particle analysis essentially con- firmed that the image defocussing study was reliable and also established that a small number of platinum and ruthenium monometallic particles were present. On the other hand, a recent detailed EDXS study performed on supported metallic clusters which were prepared using the amine precursors showed that all metallic particles were bimetallic [ 81. Small particles were ruthenium rich while the larger particles were platinum rich. 3.2. Catalytic activity The TOF and product distribution in terms of the mole percentages of reaction products for the hydrogenolysis of MCP are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 for the bimetallic catalysts prepared using the chloride and amine precursors, respectively. Depending on the reactivity of the sample, the monometallic catalysts were reported at 413 K and 493 K. Catalytic activities and selectivities were compared at 433 K for the bimetallic samples. Methylcyclopentane hydrogenolysis yields 2-methyl- pentane (2MP), 3-methylpentane (3MP) and n-hexane (n-H) as reaction products (C,) according to a selective or a non-selective mechanism [ 11; smaller hydro- carbon molecules (C, to C,) may be formed by consecutive reactions. The follow- ing selectivity parameters were evaluated: selectivity towards deep hydrogenolysis G.

The selectivity ratios !=I i= I 2MP/3MP and 3MP/n-hexane are related to carbon-carbon scission between two sets of secondary carbon atoms and carbon-carbon cleavage between two secondary atoms and between a secondary and a tertiary carbon atom, respectively. No significant deactivation was observed in any of the samples after sequential catalytic runs at the same temperature and only small variations ( f 1.5%) in the product distribution were observed. The turnover frequency observed for the sup- ported Pt-Ru bimetallic catalysts prepared from chloride precursors (Series A, Table 3) was higher than that observed for the bimetallic catalysts prepared using amine precursors (Series B, Table 4). In the former the TOF parallels the increase in the nominal concentration of ruthenium. With regard to C-C bond cleavage selectivities, the extent of deep hydrogenolysis products (C, to C,) in the monometallic ruthenium catalyst prepared from chloride precursors is 47% at 413 K and 100% at 493 K. In the latter, 65% of the observed products were methane (Table 3). The ruthenium monometallic catalyst prepared from amine precursors (Table 4)) showed that 49% of the reaction products were small molecules.

Diaz et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 3346 RuCl, . 3H20, the ruthenium catalyst prepared using the amine precursor showed significant hydrogenolytic activity at a substantially higher temperature (493 K) . On the supported Pt-Ru bimetallic catalysts the deep hydrogenolysis behavior of ruthenium was depressed. For the catalysts prepared using chloride precursors (Table 3), the selectivity towards the formation of small hydrocarbon molecules (C, to C,) ranged from 11.7% to 34.3%, following the increase in the nominal ruthenium content of the catalyst. It is important to remember that all these exper- iments were carried out at 433 K where platinum is not an active catalyst for the hydrogenolysis reaction. For the bimetallic catalysts prepared using the amine preparation (Table 4)) deep hydrogenolysis does not take place with the possible exception of the catalyst with a nominal loading corresponding to 50 at.-% Ru which showed 14% of C, to C, products. The selectivity towards carbon-carbon bond cleavage of the MCP ring is sum- marized in Tables 5 and 6. In order to make a comparison between these results and those obtained on pure platinum catalysts, we have included values obtained at a higher reaction temperature (493 K) for which platinum is active in carbon- carbon bond cleavage reactions. Values of the ratio 2-methylpentane to 3-methylpentane (2MP/3MP) are shown in Table 5. For platinum and for the supported Pt-Ru bimetallic clusters the observed ratios were all higher than 2, the value which would be expected based solely on the statistical cleavage of the secondary carbon atoms. Results obtained at higher temperature (493 K) were not significantly different. The values for the ruthenium monometallic catalysts ranged from 1.8 to 2.4 for Series A and Series B catalysts, respectively. The results concerning the selectivity ratio 3-methylpentane to n-hexane (3MP/ n-H) are summarized in Table 6 for both series of catalysts at 433 K and 493 K. Platinum monometallic catalysts showed 3MP/n-H values of 1.1 and 0.6 for Series A and Series B, respectively. The bimetallic samples and the Ru/SiO, catalysts showed values for the 3MP/n-H ratio which ranged from 3.3 to 9.0.

On the other hand it is of interest to note that all the supported Pt-Ru bimetallic catalysts prepared from amine precursors were active at 433 K, while the mono- metallic ruthenium catalyst of the same series was quite inactive at this temperature. In order to confirm the presence of the cyclic mechanism pathway in isomeri- zation reactions, experiments using 13C labelled molecules were performed on the bimetallic catalysts (Series A) which had Pt/Ru ratios of 3 and 0.33, respectively. These studies were performed at 493 K using 2-methylpentane-2-r3C as the reactant. The percentage of the reaction occurring by the cyclic mechanism was found to be 47% for both samples. Abnormally labelled molecules were not detected in the products. 4. Discussion In order to explain the differences in reactivity and selectivity of the supported Pt-Ru/SiO, catalysts used in this study, it is worthwhile to dwell briefly on the characterization studies which have been reported on these catalysts [ 8,9]. For the catalysts prepared using the chloride precursors (Series A), the platinum metal precursor interacts weakly with the support. However, the ruthenium precursor is strongly bound. Because the adsorbed platinum precursor [ PtCl,] *- is negatively charged, it is repelled by the negatively charged support and has a high degree of surface mobility. During pretreatment it diffuses rapidly across the support and interacts with hydrogen atoms adsorbed on reduced ruthenium metal surface sites. This leads to reduction followed by nucleation atop the ruthenium surface sites to form supported Pt-Ru bimetallic clusters which are strongly enriched in platinum. Because pretreatment temperatures are considerably lower than those required to 42 G. Diaz et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 3346 reach thermodynamic phase equilibria, subsequent equilibration reactions do not occur. It is important to note that in this method of preparation, approximately 20% of the supported metal particles were found to be monometallic in addition to Pt- Ru/SiO, bimetallic particles. Additionally metal dispersions were rather small. Bimetallic particles prepared using amine precursors interact strongly with the support (Series B) and result in supported Pt-Ru bimetallic particles which are highly dispersed and are also 100% bimetallic. Monometallic particles were not observed [ 81. A word regarding the chloride content of both Series A and B should be mentioned. Both series of bimetallic catalysts were prepared using metal pre- cursors which contained chloride. However, the precursors used to prepare Series A had substantially more chloride than those used in the preparation of Series B. It is also important to note that the washing procedure used in the preparation of Series B insured that a catalyst which was virtually free of chloride was obtained [ 12-l 41. Series A catalysts on the other hand, contained significant concentrations of chloride. It is well known that hydrogenolysis reactions are structure sensitive. Dicarbyne or dicarbene species are generally regarded to be intermediates in these reactions. Actually, the strong tendency of ruthenium to give deep hydrogenolysis is explained usually by the facility of this metal to form multiply-bound species [ 15,161 which are favored on dense planes [ 171. Because the formation of these species is favored by large surface ensembles [ 181, deep hydrogenolysis reactions should be enhanced on large particles. Actually this is the case for the ruthenium monometallic catalysts, as seen before. With regard to the bimetallic samples, deep hydrogenolysis reactions occur on Series A catalysts as shown by the presence of C, products. The decrease in selectivity towards the formation of C6 products (Se,) in general parallels the increase in the nominal concentration of ruthenium and the same holds for the TOF. However, the most important feature of ruthenium as an extensive hydrogenolysis catalyst has been lost as a result of clustering with platinum atoms. This result has also been observed on alumina supported Pt-Ru catalysts [ 5,6]. The selectivity for C, products (S,,) for the catalysts prepared using the amine precursors approached 100% at 433 K (Table 4). Only the bimetallic catalyst which had a Pt/Ru ratio of 1.0 and the monometallic Ru/SiO, catalyst yielded lower carbon chain fragments. It is worthwhile to point out that the bimetallic catalyst also had the lowest dispersion (50%) and the largest average particle size of the series prepared using the amine precursors ( see Table 1) . This catalyst also had the highest hydrogenolysis activity. The high yields of C6 products observed for the catalysts which were prepared using the amine precursors was in marked contrast to results obtained using the corresponding chloride precursors on both 90, (Table 3) and A1203 [ 51. Differences in the physical characteristics of the two series of catalysts include: ( 1) particle size, ( 2) surface composition and (3) particle composition. We should reemphasize that the surface composition of the Series A catalysts was sharply G. Diaz et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 33-46 43 enriched in platinum [ 91. This results in a decrease in the total number of Ru-Ru dual surface sites. Because platinum is not active in hydrogenolysis reactions at a temperature for which ruthenium is, we conclude from our results that Pt-Ru surface sites also have a low activity in reactions involving carbon+arbon cleavage. The presence of a large number of mixed surface sites on the supported bimetallic clusters prepared from amine precursors ( 100% bimetallic) might be responsible for inhibiting the formation of small hydrocarbons. On the other hand, the presence of a small number of monometallic Ru/SiO* particles in the Series A catalysts could explain the trend in activity as shown by the TOF values and the lower selectivity to C6 products (Sc,) compared to Series B catalysts. Several reports have shown that chloride ions may affect both catalytic and chemisorptive properties. Some of them include effects on carbon monoxide and hydrogen chemisorption [ 191, surface titration measurements [ 121, cracking of carbon-carbon bonds [ 201 and reforming reactions on Pt-Re/Al,O, catalysts [ 2 11. Miura et al. [ 141 showed that the activity for the hydrogenolysis of propane decreased with increasing chloride content of Ru/SiO* catalysts. This seems not to be the case here. Series A catalysts containing significant concentrations of chloride were more active than Series B catalysts where the washing procedure insured a catalyst free of chloride. Considering the somewhat contradictory results on the role of chloride in the carbon-carbon cleavage reactions we come to the conclusion that even though the amounts of chloride remaining in the Series A catalysts may be of some importance, particle size effects and the presence of a small number of monometallic particles on these bimetallic catalysts override the effect of chloride. The ratio 2MP/3MP is related to the rate of cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds located in the /3 position to those located in the y position relative to the tertiary carbon atom. Based solely on statistical considerations this ratio should be 2. The values reported in Table 5 and on Pt-Ru/Alz03 show that this ratio is considerably greater than 2 [ 51. From these, we conclude that p carbon*arbon bond cleavage is preferred. One possible explanation for this behavior is that the cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond in the p position to the tertiary carbon atom would be favored if this tertiary carbon atom is partially positively charged. Such a possibility could be explained if a slightly acid behavior is present. Another explanation related to the presence of a concerted carbon<arbon bond cleavage mechanism may be invoked. From a a-adsorbed methylcyclopentane species, an attack of the hydrogen on the tertiary carbon atom may lead to the formation of a carbene species. The ease with which this hydrogen is removed may explain the predominance of the formation of the 2-methylpentane product. The selectivity ratio 3MP/n-H is related to the rate of non-selective hydrogen- olysis to that obtained for selective hydrogenolysis [ I]. This selectivity ratio decreases sharply with a decrease in particle size. For platinum this ratio drops from 4 to 0.5 [ 1 ] ; for ruthenium the value ranges from 6 to 2 [ 61. It is apparent from these results that the non-selective hydrogenolysis reaction which favors bond cleavage between tertiary and secondary carbon atoms (n-hexane formation) is 44 G. Diaz et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 33-M favored for platinum on small particles. Ruthenium and Pt-Ru catalysts always have a selective character denoted by the high 3MP/n-H ratios. Similar studies performed on Pt-Ru/Al,O, bimetallic catalysts [5] resulted in 3MP/n-H ratios which were considerably higher ( 12 to 9). The value of the 3MP/n-H ratio obtained for the Pt/SiO, catalyst prepared using the amine precursor was 0.6. This result is completely consistent with those observed for platinum catalysts with the same particle size and should, therefore, favor non-selective hydrogenolysis [ 11. The value obtained for this ratio on Ru/SiO* (Series A) was close to 9.0 at 413 K. For the supported bimetallic clusters this ratio was of the same order as that obtained on Ru/SiO*. Several interesting conclusions may be drawn regarding ring opening reactions which occur as a result of carbon<arbon bond cleavage. The rate at which carbon- carbon bonds are cleaved between tertiary and secondary carbon atoms, i.e. 3MP/ n-hexane, approaches the behavior of ruthenium for both series of bimetallic catalysts. On the other hand, the rate of secondary bond cleavage observed over the bimetallic clusters is closer to that observed for the monometallic platinum catalysts prepared in this work. The ratio 2MP/3MP always exceeds that expected on purely statistical grounds. Similar results were observed in the hydrogenolysis of 2-methylpentane [ 71 where primary-secondary carbon bond scission was found to be more important than primary-tertiary scission; isopentane is favored in com- parison to n-pentane. The ratio between these two products is higher than the 0.5 expected for a purely statistical carbon bond scission. Alkane isomerization reactions have been shown to proceed according to two main reaction mechanisms. These mechanisms include: ( 1) bond shift [ 221 and, (2) cyclic mechanism [ 231. The cyclic mechanism requires the formation of an adsorbed methylcyclopentane intermediate followed by subsequent carbon<arbon bond cleavage. The actual mechanism will depend on both the dispersion and identity of the active metal. The reaction of 2MP over supported ruthenium catalysts at 493 K leads to extensive fragmentation and isomerization does not take place. On the other hand, at this temperature platinum is catalytically inactive for isom- erization reactions. Over Pt-Ru catalysts, at this temperature, a modest amount of isomerization occurs. Isomerization reactions proceeding at 493 K are representa- tive of the Pt-Ru dual sites [ 71. Through the use of labelled carbon atoms, the extent of participation in the cyclic isomerization mechanism was calculated to be 63% for Pt-Ru/Al,O, catalysts [ 71. The cyclic contribution to the isomerization reaction on Series A catalysts was 47%. This result points out that 47% of the isomer product is formed via a cyclic mechanism whatever the ratio Pt/Ru is. On the other hand, the contribution of the cyclic mechanism has been shown to increase with dispersion [ 11, therefore the observed result is consistent with the fact that Series A catalysts have shown a lower dispersion than those prepared on A&O3 [71. Concerning the synergistic effect in the TOF observed on Series B catalysts, where Pt-Ru bimetallic catalysts were active at a lower temperature than the ruthe- G. Diaz et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 3346 45 nium monometallic catalyst, an effect of this kind has been observed before [ 241 for silica supported Pt-Ru bimetallic clusters. Miura et al. [ 241 observed an increase by an order of magnitude in the rate of benzene hydrogenation for bimetallic catalysts which had a surface composition of 50% Pt. These authors found that the rate was maximized when the number of Pt-Ru dual surface sites were also a maximum. The explanation was that the presence of dual Pt-Ru surface sites decreased the extent of self poisoning which occurred as a result of an increase in the concentration of deeply dehydrogenated surface intermediates. 5. Conclusions The following important conclusions can be drawn from this study. - When Pt-Ru catalysts are prepared from chloride precursors it was confirmed that in addition to bimetallic particles, a small amount of monometallic particles were also present. - Reactivity and selectivity in hydrogenolysis reactions of MCP on Pt-Ru/ Si02 prepared from chloride or amine precursors are explained by differences in particle size and bimetallic effects. - At temperatures where only ruthenium is active, the MCP hydrogenolysis reaction showed that the extensive formation of C, to C5 products was depressed over Pt-Ru bimetallic clusters. Tertiary-secondary carbon-carbon bond cleavage approaches that observed for ruthenium while secondary-secondary carbon-carbon bond cleavage is closer to that observed for platinum. The behavior of a Pt-Ru surface is never comparable to that of a pure ruthenium surface. - The 2MP isomerization reaction proceeding at 493 K is representative of Pt- Ru activated dual sites since platinum is inactive at this temperature and ruthenium leads to extensive degradation of the molecule. The contribution of the cyclic mechanism which was found to be 47% is representative of the metallic behavior of the catalyst. - A synergistic effect was observed for the catalysts prepared from amine precursors as measured by an increase in the TOF between the ruthenium catalyst and the Pt-Ru catalysts. This could be related to the presence of a maximum number of Pt-Ru dual surface sites.
