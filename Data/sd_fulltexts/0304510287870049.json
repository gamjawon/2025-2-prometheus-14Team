L. ELIZAROVA, L. G. MATVIENKO and V. N. PARMON Institute of Catalysis, Novosibirsk 630090 (U.S.S.R.) (Received March 13, 1987; accepted July 21, 1987) Summary The reaction kinetics of water oxidation by Ru(bpy)33\"1\" in the presence of Co(III) and Fe(III) colloidal hydroxides are studied as a function of pH, catalyst concentration and simple and complex salt additives. It was found that the kinetics of 0^ formation and that of oxidant consumption differ due to side oxidation reactions. A reaction mechanism taking into account the ion exchange properties of the catalyst surface hydroxo groups and suggesting dioxygen formation on two neighbouring catalytically active centres is proposed. Introduction Oxidation of water to dioxygen by strong metal-complex one-electron oxidants of the Ru(bpy)33\"1\" type (bpy = bipyridine) according to the reaction 4Ru(bpy)33\"1\" + 2H20 \" 4Ru(bpy)32+ + 0^ + 4H\"1\" (1) is known to occur only in the presence of catalysts. Various compounds of Fe, Co, Cu and Ru are most widely used and investigated as such catalysts, a common opinion being that initial forms of salts and complexes of the mentioned metals possess no catalytic activity. However, their partly hydro lyzed compounds formed during reaction (1) are known to be catalyt- ically active, as well as the corresponding hydroxides of these metals appearing as products of complete hydrolysis of the starting compounds [ 1 ]. The most specific peculiarity of reaction (1) was found to be the coexistence of side-processes consisting of oxidation by the same oxidant of coordinated bipyridine, or any other oxidizable particles present in multicomponent systems where the reaction occurs (e.g. in systems for photocleavage of water). Since the mechanisms of all the reactions mentioned are quite complex, the literature contains an abundance of dif- ferent and frequently conflicting opinions [1]. However, a detailed examina- tion of the mechanism of water oxidation by one-electron oxidants can be useful both for creating artificial systems for photocatalytic cleavage of 0304-5102/87/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 172 water and for understanding the mechanism of action of the O^-evolving centre in 'photosystem II' of green plants, which is one of the greatest mysteries of natural photosynthesis. Note that the use of Co and Fe salts and complexes as homogeneous catalysts makes it possible to study the kinetics of 0; formation (with the help of the dark electrode, for instance) as well as the oxidant consumption (spectro photo metrically). However, in this case the study of the mechanism of the processes under consideration is complicated because the initial forms of the catalytically active species are hydrolyzed and produce a set of compounds of uncertain composition. On the other hand, it is very difficult to investigate the reaction kinetics using bulk hydroxides with a definite structure as catalysts. This is due to a strong 0^ adsorption on the catalyst surface, as well as the high turbidity of the solutions under study. In this paper, in order to study the mechanism of reaction (1), colloidal hydroxides of Co(III) and Fe(III) free of the above-mentioned disadvantages were used as catalysts. Experimental Ru(bpy)3(C104)3 and (^(NHs^HsC^CK^s were synthesized as described in [2, 3]. Stabilized colloidal solutions (sols) of Co(III) and Fe(III) hydroxides were obtained by quickly adding 1-2 M NaOH solution to 5 X 10~3 M Co(NH3)2(H20)4 (0104)3 or Fe(NOs)3 solutions up to pH ~11 in the presence of polyvinyl alcohol under vigorous stirring. Additionally, sols of Fe(III) hydroxide were prepared by thermolysis (at 373 K) or peptization of Fe(III)-hydrogel; the samples of Fe-sols obtained in these different ways had nearly the same catalytic properties. Binary sols were prepared under the same conditions as individual ones by alkalization of the mixture of salt solutions of catalytically active (Co, Fe) and inactive (Bi(III), Ce(IV), Al(III), Ti(IV)) cations in a 2:1 atomic ratio. The kinetics of 0^ formation was monitored using the dark electrode, that of Ru(bpy)33\"1\" consumption was registered by a Specol (GDR) spectro- photometer (at \\ = 675 nm). All experiments were carried out at 298 K and an initial oxidant concentration of [Ru(bpy)33+]o = 1 X 10~3 M. The initial reaction rate of 0; formation, VQ, and that of the oxidant consumption, Vpu, were obtained from the initial portion of the kinetic curves. The yields of 0; (s, in %) after reaction termination were measured with respect to the stoichiometry of reaction (1). Experiments were carried out in 0.02 M pyro phosphate buffer at various pH values. According to small angle scattering measurements, the particles of the sols prepared have a slightly stretched shape, and their average diameter is ~20 - 30 A. On storing these sols, during the first two days acidation of sol 173 solutions occurs, with a concomitant change in electron absorption spectra and an increase in the average particle size. Simultaneously, the catalytic properties also change, that is, the 0; formation rate decreases while the oxidant consumption rate remains the same or even increases. As for their chemical nature, the colloidal particles obtained seem to be oxide-hydroxides similar to the corresponding bulk samples [4, 5]. Typical kinetic curves for 0; formation and Ru(bpy)33'1' consumption in the presence of Co(III) and Fe(III) sols are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. It is clearly seen that the kinetics of 02 formation do not coincide with those of oxidant consumption: (i) 1-2 min after the beginning of the reaction, the evolution of 0^ stops, whereas the oxidant concentration continues to change; (ii) an increase in the catalyst concentration is followed by an acceleration of Ru(bpy)33\"1\" consumption, while the rate of the 0^ formation as well as the yields of 0; pass through maxima; and (iii) the O^ formation rate, rather than the Ru(bpy)33+ reduction rate, is heavily dependent on pH (Table 1). Unlike the heterogeneous analogs, colloidal Co(III) hydroxide is far more active and selective than the Fe(III) sol. This fact is most clearly illustrated by the dependence of the reaction kinetics on pH (Table I): in slightly acidic solutions in the presence of the Fe sol, no 0; formation is observed although the oxidant consumption rate is higher than in the blank experiment in the absence of a catalyst. Regarding the oxidation of water in the presence of homogeneous cata- lysts the inhibitory action of Ru(bpy)32+, which is the second product of reaction (1), has been indicated by many authors [6-8]. The same effect of Ru(bpy)32\"1' additives is observed for colloidal catalysts. Moreover, as we have found, additives of some other cationic complexes such as Co(bpy)33+ and Pig. 1.

It should be emphasized that in this case the reactions of 0^ formation and Ru(bpy)33\"1' reduction also demonstrate non-identical behaviour: in the presence of any of the additives mentioned above a rather strong inhibition of the 0^ reaction is observed, whereas the oxidant consumption rate (mostly for the Fe sol) is not slowed down but may even be enhanced. Figure 3 shows the 0^ formation kinetics in the presence of the Fe sol with some simple salt additives. As the concentration of LiCI (or NaCI) increases, the inhioitory action of this additive is enhanced, the 0^ reaction being inhibited to a far greater extent than the Ru(bpy)33\"1\" reduction. In the presence of identical amounts of NH4C1 a stronger inhibition of 0^ formation is observed (Fig. 3, curve 3), while the oxidant consumption is 175 TABLE 2 Effect of addition of complex cations on the initial rates (in 10~4 M min~1) of 0; forma- tion VQ, Ru(bpy)33\"1' reduction u^y, and 02 yields s Catalyst 2.0 x lO^M Co-sol, pH 7.0 8.3 x lO^M Co-sol, pH 7.0 8.9 XlO^M Fe-sol, pH 7.5 Additives VQ \"Ru S VQ iiRu s none 1.44 10.4 56 1.68 13.4 50 0.40 3.8 42 1 X lO-^MR^bpyla2\" 0.56 5.8 39 0.94 9.8 39 0.03 3.1 4 1 X lO^MCotbpyjs3\"\" 0.56 10.4 22 1.12 14.6 31 0.06 3.6 7 5xlO-3MCo(NH3)5Cl:2+ ------ 0.18 3.5 21 Fig. 3.

On the contrary, addition of LiClC>4 (NaClC>4) gives rise to quite different changes in the reactions: 0; formation is markedly slowed, mostly at the beginning of the reaction, out the amounts of 0^ evolved in these cases are 1.5 - 2 times higher than in the absence of ClO^\" anions (Fig. 3, curve 4). Analogous kinetic curves were obtained for the reaction in the presence of Co sols. As we have shown earlier, introduction of catalytically inactive cations into the catalyst can significantly change the catalytic properties of both bulk [9, 10] and ionite-supported [11] hydroxides of both Fe and Co.

As in the case of bulk hydroxides, the cations of Bi(III) and Ce(IV) show a promoting effect, while the cations of Al(III) and Ti(IV) produce an inhibitory effect. Note that a mechanical mixture of indepen- dently prepared sols of Fe hydroxide and those of another metal has the properties of an individual Fe hydroxide sol. Introduction of the same cations into the Co hydroxide sol does not improve activity and selectivity of the latter, unlike the case of the hetero- geneous analog, probably because a mechanical rather than a chemical mixture of the hydroxides is formed. An exception is the binary Co Ce hydroxide sol; for this catalyst the reaction rate and the yields of 0; were much lower compared to the reaction with the individual Co sol. Discussion Earlier [10], we proposed a scheme for the catalytic action of Co(III) and Fe(III) hydroxides in water oxidation via reaction (1). This scheme was derived from the ion-exchange properties of Co(III) and Fe(III) hydroxides, both individual and binary. According to the scheme, the first step in water oxidation seems to be an adsorption of the oxidant cation onto the surface OH groups of the catalyst, which require definite acid-base properties to be able to participate in the cation exchange in the specific pH region: M^-OH ^= M111-^ + H^^^M111-^)-- Ru(bpy)33+,ds (2) where M111 represents the catalytically active cation of the Co(III) or Fe(III) hydroxides. As a result of this reaction, the deprotonated hydroxo-group appeared to be coordinated with the two quite strong oxidants so that the next step could be a transfer of two electrons producing an active form of oxygen 177 (possibly, an adsorbed atom of 0) together with the reduced forms of the oxidant and the catalyst: e e M^I^O<:>Ru(bpy)33+ads ^ M\" 0\\^ Ru(bpy)32+ads (3) The electron transfer yielding the same products can also follow an alternative path: e 2e Mni_o-.. Ru(bpy)33+ads > M^O- Ru(bpy)32\\ds ^ MII 0:ds Ru(bpy)32+,ds (3a) In order to create the 0^ molecule from the two adsorbed oxygen atoms, the active catalyst centres containing the mentioned M111 OH frag- ments indeed should be close to each other: MII 0:ds Ru(bpy)32+ads H,0 ^2MII(H20)+02+2Ru(bpy)32+ (4) MII 0:ds Ru(bpy)32+ads If this condition is not fulfilled, a side oxidation reaction (for example, oxidation of coordinated bipyridine) occurs, and dioxygen is not formed: H 0 M\" 0:ds Ru(bpy)32+ads ^ M\"(H20) + R^bpy^bpy')^ (4a) (where bpy' stands for an oxidized form of the bipyridine molecule). The last step of the catalytic cycle should be the reoxidation of the active catalyst centre by another molecule of the oxidant: Ru(bpy)33\"1\" M\"(H20) > Iv^-OH + H* (5) This step seems to be rate determining. The proposed scheme is similar to that suggested earlier [8] but in our case each step has a concrete chemical sense. In our opinion, the mechanism is confirmed by the kinetic results obtained in this work. The following data seem to support this conclusion. In the case of homogeneous catalysis by Fe(III), Co(II), and Cu(II) cations, the strong dependence of reaction kinetics on pH is thought to be a consequence of the necessity of prehydrolysis of these ions, because only the hydrolyzed particles become catalytically active [1]. However, the same dependence is also observed for Fe and Co hydroxides (both bulk and col- loidal) which are the final products of the hydrolysis. Hydroxides of many metal are widely used at present as perfect ion exchangers; surface hydroxide ions are known to serve the role of functional groups of such ion exchangers. Thus we believe that the ion exchange (adsorption) properties of the hydroxides we studied also determine their catalytic activity. For instance, when Ca2\"^ ions were preadsorbed on the bulk Fe or Co hydroxides by ion exchange, the catalytic properties of the 178 samples towards the water oxidation reaction were lost [10]. Thus, in fact, the adsorption centres of the hydroxides are indeed catalytically active. As in the ion exchange process, the occurrence of the catalytic reaction (1) in the presence of the Fe and Co hydroxides is determined both by the total amount of surface OH groups and by their acid properties. As we reported earlier [10], the mean pKg value of the surface OH groups of bulk Fe hydroxides is about 8 - 9, which corresponds to the maximum pH value of the region of catalytic activity of this hydroxide, and is probably due to the large number of deprotonated surface OH groups in this pH region. At pH <8 - 9, the concentration of such groups, which can serve as adsorption centres for the oxidant cations, is yery low. Moreover, at such pH these groups seem to be remote from each other, which decreases the probability of 02 molecule formation (step (4)) and correspondingly, increases that of reaction (4a). Hence, oxidant consumption in the side-processes appears to be a catalytic reaction, being consecutive to and not parallel with the main process (1), that is having with it the common stage, as we assumed earlier [6]. As follows from above, the maximum surface concentration of the adsorbed oxidant (i.e. the shift of equilibrium (2) to the right) is of great importance for 02 molecule formation. This concentration depends on the amount of both Ru(bpy)33\"1\" and the catalyst in solution, along with pH. We have already mentioned that with increasing concentration of the sols, the 0^ yields are first increased and then decreased. The latter seems to be caused by the decrease of the oxidant surface concentration when the catalyst-to-oxidant ratio in solution is increased. Extreme dependences of 0; yields on the concentration of homogeneous catalysts have already been reported by us [6] and also by other authors [7, 12]. Ion exchange properties of the hydroxide catalysts produce not only a positive effect (the adsorption of the oxidant cations) but also a negative effect, because any other cations in solution can participate in proton exchange with surface hydroxo groups. As the result, the active centres can be blocked, which inevitably leads to catalyst poisoning. This seems to explain why the catalysts studied are more effective in unbuffered than in buffered solutions [13], and also why additives of complex cations, in particular Ru(bpy)32\"1\", inhibit 0; formation (Table 2). However, if the negative effects of these additives result only in blocking the catalyst active centres, both the 0^ reaction and Ru(bpy)33\"1\" reduction would be inhibited. The observed more complicated dependence of the oxidant reduction kinetics on the nature of additives is probably due to some additional oxidant consumption to oxidize the coordinated ligands (NH3 or bpy). It should be noted that the influence of the additives on the 0; formation rate is weaker in a 8 X 10~5 M Co sol solution than in a 2 X 10~5 M solution of the same sol, this may be due to the fact that while the catalyst content in the solution increases (at a constant concentration of the additives), the concentration of the cations adsorbed on its surface decreases and hence its inhibitory effect is lost. 179 Thus it is also possible to understand the effect of the forcing salts dissolved in the homogeneous phase. The inhibitory action of even small amounts of NaCI or Lid, which increases with increasing concentrations, can be explained by Na+ or Li\"*\" adsorption on the catalyst active centres. Likewise, adsorption of NH^ ions is probably accompanied by their catalytic oxidation, which is indicated by an acceleration of oxidant con- sumption in their presence. Formation of N3 along with 0^ in the photo- catalytic system for water oxidation having Co(NH3)5C12\"1\" as an electron acceptor in the presence of ammonium salts was reported in [14]. The effect of perchlorates on the kinetics of reaction (1) appears to be the most complex. It is well known [15, 16] that of singly-charged anions perchlorates form the most stable outersphere complexes with bipyridine compounds of Fe, Co and Ru. Ru(bpy)33+ is expected to form a complex with perchlorate ions in an excess of the latter. This results in an increase in the size of the oxidant particles, a decrease in the charge of these par- ticles and, consequently, a weakening of their adsorbability on the catalyst surface. On the other hand, the C104~ ion forms a slightly soluble salt with Ru(bpy)32\"*\", which removes the inhibiting cation from the catalyst surface and thus improves the conditions for 0; formation. In the same way one can explain why the poisoning effect of adsorbed Ca24\" ions on 0^ formation is smaller in a borate buffer than in a phosphate one, where these cations form slightly soluble salts [10]. As a result of these two different effects of C104~ ions, we observe that simultaneously the 0; yield increases and the reaction rate decreases. The higher the C104\" concentration, the higher the inhibitory effect. As follows from Table 1, in the presence of Fe sol, 0; is formed only at pH >7. However, if 0.1 M NaC104 (LiC104) is also present in the solution it is possible to obtain up to 30% 0^ at pH 6.7. This seems to be direct evidence for the Fe sol-catalyzed water oxidation in this pH range as well; however the molecule of dioxygen cannot form in these conditions, because, in the absence of perchlorate, reaction (4a) is more probable than reaction (4). A similar explanation applies for the termination of the 0^ reaction with observed continuous oxidant consumption (Figs. 1 and 2), which is caused by accumulation of Ru(bpy)32+ on the catalyst surface; in the presence of NaC104 such an accumulation is prevented, and termination of the 0; reaction is not observed. We thus conclude that the formation of an active centre consisting of two (or more) catalytically active ions is not necessary for the oxidation of water to 0^ in the presence of hydroxides. The 02 molecule is likely to form even when deprotonated fragments of the active centres M111-^\" are considerably remote from each other, as happens at low pH values. In this case it is much more important for the adsorbed oxidizable cations (like NH41\" or ligand-containing cations) to be removed from the catalyst surface. If for oxidation of water to 0; the formation of active centres having more than one catalytically active ion were necessary, addition of any 180 catalytically inactive ions to the catalyst content would only make their catalytic properties worse. However, from the data obtained it follows that the introduction of metal cations of a different nature into the catalyst can result not only in weakening but also in strengthening the catalytic action of both bulk and supported Co and Fe hydroxides [9-11]. As follows from the mechanism under consideration, the M111 OH fragments of the catalytic centre should have acidic properties strong enough to facilitate both adsorption of the oxidant and oxidation of the deprotonated centre. Thus, the effect of metal additives having different electron accepta- bilities is probably caused by a change in the positive charge of the active ion and, consequently, in the acidic properties of the coordinated hydroxo group [10]. In conclusion, note that the boundary between homogeneous (Fe(III) and Co(III) salts and complexes) and heterogeneous (oxides and hydroxides of the same metals) water oxidation catalysts is as conventional as between the true and colloidal solutions. Absolutely identical kinetic behaviour in the presence of these two types of catalysts, namely the dependence of initial reaction rate and 0; yields on pH, the catalyst-to-oxidant ratio and on the presence of the side ions in the solutions, indicate that catalytically active particles have the same nature. Hydroxide compounds are supposed to be of that sort. They are polynuclear in nature, and their particle size depends on the method of synthesis, which determines quantitative, but not qualitative, kinetic characteristics. Among heterogeneous catalysts for water oxidation, those based on RuC>2 are now considered to be most effective [1]. However, the catalytic properties of these compounds are impossible to reproduce and the proposed mechanisms of their catalytic action differ to a large extent [1, 17, 18]. It is worth noting that bulk and colloidal RuO^'nH^O synthesized by us from various stock compounds in different ways (described in the literature as well) turned out to be of low activity or practically inactive in reaction (1). At the same time hydroxide compounds based on Co(III) and Fe(III) are always catalytically active, regardless of the way they were obtained. This is probably due to the fact that in any case the same active centres, containing catalytically active trivalent cations with a sufficient number of hydroxo groups with optimal acidity, are formed. We believe a unified approach to the mechanism of the catalytic action of noble and non-noble transition metal oxide-hydroxide catalysts will help to further the development of highly effective, stable and reproducible water oxidation catalysts. Acknowledgements We are grateful to V. N. Kolomijchuk, who measured the size of the colloidal particles, and to 0. V. Gerasimov for helpful discussions. 181 References 1 G. L. Elizarova and V. N.

Elizarova L.G. Matvienko V.N. Parmon Institute of Catalysis, Novosibirsk 630090 U.S.S.R. The reaction kinetics of water oxidation by Ru(bpy)3 3+ in the presence of Co(III) and Fe(III) colloidal hydroxides are studied as a function of pH, catalyst concentration and simple and complex salt additives. It was found that the kinetics of O2 formation and that of oxidant consumption differ due to side oxidation reactions. A reaction mechanism taking into account the ion exchange properties of the catalyst surface hydroxo groups and suggesting dioxygen formation on two neighbouring catalytically active centres is proposed.
