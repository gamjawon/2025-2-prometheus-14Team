By using 4Na2SO4·2H2O2·NaCl as a reductant, manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve (OMS-2) with enhanced surface area and mixed valence was prepared successfully. OMS-2 showed excellent catalytic ability towards aerobic oxidative synthesis of 1,3,5-triazines from benzyl alcohols and benzamidine. Methyl benzenes, DMF and DMSO could also be employed as substrates to react with benzamidine offering triazines under the heterogeneous conditions. The catalytic system features base-free conditions, broad substrate scope, high chemoselectivity, operational simplicity, catalyst recyclability and utilization of O2 as the green oxidant. Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Keywords Heterogeneous catalysis Oxidative cyclization OMS-2 Triazine Benzamidine 1 Introduction 1,3,5-triazines, as key skeletons of many important bioactive heterocyclic compounds, frequently present in insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, antimalarial, antitumor and antivirals [1–3]. Meanwhile, due to their chemical properties, they are used in organic dyes, chelating ligands for synthesis of organometallic materials, liquid crystals, electroluminescent materials and fluorescent brighteners [4–6]. Generally, synthesis of 1,3,5-triazines involves cyclotrimerization of nitriles, coupling of halogenated triazines over transition-metal catalysts and specific multicomponent reactions [7–9]. In recent years, amidines were found to be efficient substrates to react with alcohols, aldehydes, amines, DMF, DMSO or toluene for synthesis of 1,3,5-triazines via oxidative pathway [10–15]. However, from the perspective of clean synthesis, very limited reports have been found on the applications of non-noble metals as recyclable catalysts in 1,3,5-triazines synthesis under base- and ligand-free conditions. Manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve (OMS-2) containing 2 × 2 and 1D tunnel structure with a pore size of 0.46 nm is composed by edge- and corner-shared MnO6 octahedra [16]. Because of its excellent properties, like catalysis, adsorption and semiconductivity, OMS-2 has been applied in organic synthesis, environmental catalysis, separation and batteries [17–21]. Especially, it generally exhibits mixed-valence of Mn (Mn4+, Mn3+ and Mn2+), which makes it superior heterogeneous catalyst and support in many aerobic oxidations through tuning the ratio of mixed-valent manganese to accelerate electron transfer during redox process [22–26]. Our group recently developed methods for preparation of OMS-2 to further prepare supported catalyst or directly use it as the catalyst in N-containing heterocycles synthesis under ligand- and additive-free conditions. And, chemoselective synthesis of 1,2-dihydro-1,3,5-triazine and quinazolines from alcohols and N-arylamidines via establishment of certain catalytic systems was realized (Scheme 1 , a and b) [27,28]. Very recently, we prepared OMS-2 successfully using 4Na2SO4·2H2O2·NaCl as a reductant via reduction of KMnO4 (denoted as OMS-2-SH-A). Synthesized OMS-2-SH-A which exhibited obviously enhanced surface area and amounts of Mn2+ compared with OMS-2 prepared by conventional reflux method was found to be a highly efficient catalyst for oxidation of benzyl alcohols. As shown in Scheme S1 (see ESI), the catalytic system could tolerate various substrates and excellent conversions and yields were obtained when the reactions were carried out in toluene at 110 °C under O2. With our continuous research interest in clean synthesis of heterocycles over MnOx-based catalysts [29–31], we would like to describe a procedure for synthesis of OMS-2 material using relatively safe and stable H2O2 trapped reagent, 4Na2SO4·2H2O2·NaCl, as the reductant via reduction of KMnO4. After full characterization, obtained OMS-2 catalyst shows larger surface area and more amounts of Mn2+ than OMS-2 synthesized by conventional procedure. Importantly, as-synthesized material is an efficient recyclable catalyst for the aerobic oxidative synthesis of 1,3,5-triazines from benzamidine and alcohols via in-situ formed aldehydes. Furthermore, toluene and its derivatives were directly employed as substrates replacing alcohols to yield desired products over the synthesized catalyst (Scheme 1, c). 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation OMS-2-SH material was synthesized by the reduction of KMnO4. Firstly, a mixture of KOAc (2.5 g, 25 mmol), acetic acid (2.5 mL) and 4Na2SO4·2H2O2·NaCl was stirred at room temperature to generate a buffer solution. The solution of KMnO4 (3.25 g, 20 mmol) was added dropwisely into the buffer solution with stirring at room temperature. Subsequently, the brown mixture was kept stirring at 100 °C for 24 h under air. The reaction mixture was cooled down and filtrated followed by washing with deionized water. Lastly, the obtained solid material was dried at 120 °C for overnight to yield the OMS-2-SH catalyst. The obtained OMS-2-SH catalysts were named OMS-2-SH-A, OMS-2-SH-B, OMS-2-SH-C and OMS-2-SH-D, when 4Na2SO4·2H2O2·NaCl was added in 7, 5, 3.5 and 1.75 g respectively into the buffer solution. 2.2 Typical procedure for the synthesis of 1,3,5-triazine 3a OMS-2-SH-B (20 mg, 10 mol%), benzyl alcohol (0.3 mmol) and benzamidine (0.5 mmol) were added into a Schlenk tube. Then, air was removed and toluene (1 mL) was added by a syringe under O2 atmosphere. If substituted benzyl alcohol was liquid, it was added with toluene under O2 balloon protection. If methyl benzene was used as substrate instead of benzyl alcohol, it was added as solvent (1 mL) into the reaction tube by syringe under O2 atmosphere. The mixture was stirred for required time at certain temperature for 20 h. The resulting mixture was cooled down, filtered and washed with EtOAc, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the crude product. Finally, the product was purified by silica gel chromatography to yield the pure product. 3 Results and discussion Due to the excellent catalytic performance of OMS-2-SH-A in oxidation of benzyl alcohol (Scheme S1, in ESI), we firstly used it as the catalyst to optimize the reaction between benzyl alcohol and benzamidine in toluene under reflux conditions (Table 1 ). Initially, the reaction results prove that OMS-2-Re made by conventional method and its supported catalyst Cu/OMS-2-Re both failed the reaction by the use of air as the oxidant (Table 1, entries 1 and 2). Delightedly, 45% yield of 3a was isolated when OMS-2-SH-A was used as the catalyst (Table 1, entry 3). According to changing the oxidant, O2 was the best green oxidant and 85% yield of 3a was obtained (Table 1, entries 3–5). These results imply that the method for preparation of catalyst has significant influence. In addition, it was found that decreasing the reaction temperature was deleterious to the reaction. The precursors of OMS-2 were also tested in the reaction under the standard conditions, while the reactions did not occur at all (Table 1, entries 6 and 7). Subsequently, different solvents were used in the reaction at their reflux temperatures and only dimethyl carbonate (DMC), PhCl and MeNO2 yielded 3a more or less (Table 1, entries 8–15). Therefore, non-proton and non-polar solvents and reaction temperature were important factors for the success of the oxidative cyclization. Hence, the optimized reaction condition is as shown in Table 1, entry 4. To further optimize the catalytic reaction, the catalysts synthesized using different amounts of 4Na2SO4·2H2O2·NaCl were investigated (Fig. 1 ). It was found that OMS-2-SH-B showed the best catalytic ability (95% yield of 3a) and it exhibited the second largest surface area (114 m2/g). However, OMS-2-SH-D with the highest surface area (220 m2/g) only offered 15% yield of 1,3,5-triazine 3a under the optimal conditions. Characterization of catalysts via X-ray diffraction (XRD) demonstrates that OMS-2-SH-A, OMS-2-SH-B, and OMS-2-SH-C all possessed typical and pure cryptomelane phase (JCPDS 29-1020) while OMS-2-SH-D possessed birnessite phase (JCPDS 80–1098, Scheme S2, in ESI). So, the results from XRD imply that too less amounts of 4Na2SO4·2H2O2·NaCl was not enough to reduce KMnO4 and ordered cryptomelane phase and MnO6 units cannot form, which makes OMS-2-SH-D the largest surface area. The added loadings of 4Na2SO4·2H2O2·NaCl not only affected the surface areas, but also crystallinity of the final catalysts, such as OMS-2-SH-B has the largest surface area and relatively weaker crystallinity. Compared with OMS-2-Re (surface area is 67 m2/g), catalysts prepared involving 4Na2SO4·2H2O2·NaCl all show much larger surface area and stronger crystallinity (Table S1, in ESI). From our experimental results of 3a synthesis (Fig. 1), it is believed that large surface area usually means more exposed surface reactive sites which are critical in catalysis and different crystal phases of solid catalysts always influence the catalytic activity [32]. Characterization of as-synthesized catalysts was also performed by SEM and TEM. From the SEM images, we found that added loadings of 4Na2SO4·2H2O2·NaCl could significantly affect the morphologies of catalysts. Obviously, OMS-2-SH-B shows longer, thinner and more uniform, while OMS-2-SH-A is thicker and OMS-2-SH-C is shorter (Scheme S3, in ESI). In addition, compared with OMS-2-Re possessing short rod-like morphology, OMS-2-SH-B possesses long fiber-like morphology (Scheme S5, in ESI). Especially, OMS-2-SH-D does not have fiber-like morphology and is composed by small flakes (Scheme S3 and S12, in ESI). Similarly, difference of morphologies of as-synthesized catalysts was confirmed by TEM images (Scheme S4, in ESI). From the analysis of EDX, there are not Na ions existed in catalysts prepared by 4Na2SO4·2H2O2·NaCl and only K ions are detected clearly, which indicates that manganese oxide was formed by MnO6 unites with K ions in tunnel to stabilize the structure (Scheme S6, in ESI). These results from morphologies are in agreement with the information of XRD very well. Subsequently, the surface chemistry of obtained catalysts was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The catalysts synthesized with 4Na2SO4·2H2O2·NaCl possess very similar oxygen species from analysis of O 1 s (Scheme S8 and Table S3, in ESI). On the other hand, all catalysts synthesized with 4Na2SO4·2H2O2·NaCl show mixed-valence of Mn as the same as OMS-2-Re (Scheme S7, in ESI). It is obvious to find out that the method of catalyst preparation and the added loadings of 4Na2SO4·2H2O2·NaCl affect the ratio of mixed-valence of manganese. Specifically, OMS-2 catalysts prepared with 4Na2SO4·2H2O2·NaCl all possess lower amounts of Mn4+ than OMS-2-Re does. Among as-synthesized OMS-2 in this study, OMS-2-SH-B possesses the lowest amounts of Mn4+ and highest amounts of Mn2+ (Table S2, in ESI). Low amounts of Mn4+ in OMS-2 materials generally imply high concentration of oxygen vacancy defects which can adsorb, active and desorb the substrates in the reaction [33]. Therefore, low amounts of Mn4+ and high concentration of oxygen vacancy defects of OMS-2-SH-B might be important factors in catalytic performance. With the optimal catalyst (OMS-2-SH-B) in hand, a series of substituted benzyl alcohols were employed to react with benzamidine to examine the tolerance of the catalytic system (Table 2 ). Generally, electronic effect did not affect the reactions, while steric effect influenced the reaction significantly (Tables 2, 3 g ). Benzyl alcohols which can be oxidized to corresponding aldehydes all participated in the reaction smoothly and led to 1,2,3-triazines in good to excellent yields under the optimal conditions. Moreover, cinnamyl alcohol and the less-reactive heterocyclic alcohols could be tolerated successfully and gave corresponding functional 1,3,5-triazines in high yields (Tables 2, 3 n, o and p). Cyano-substituted benzyl alcohol that has two reactive functional groups was reported to react with benzamidine yielding 1,2,4-triazole with an aldehyde group through copper-catalyzed oxidative cyclization [34,35]. Interestingly, under our Mn-based catalytic system, desired 1,3,5-triazine with an untouchable cyano was obtained in excellent yields, which implies that the present reaction conditions have superior chemoselevtivity (Scheme 2 ). For further expanding the scope of the reaction, aliphatic alcohols were tried in the reaction. However, corresponding cyclic alkanes substituted 1,3,5-triazines were not observed at all and triphenyl-substituted 1,3,5-triazines were isolated in good yields under the optimal conditions (Scheme S9). Additionally, aliphatic alcohols, like cyclohexanemethanol and cyclohexenemethanol, did not react with OMS-2-SH-B and all alcohols were recovered after the reactions. These experimental facts indicate that toluene which was oxidized by OMS-2-SH-B proceeded into the reaction. In this way, some simple methyl benzenes were selected to directly react with benzamidine under the optimal conditions. As expected, electron-rich or electron-neutral toluenes proceeded the reactions very well and corresponding 1,3,5-triazines were obtained in good yields (Table 3, entries 1–4). However, electron-poor toluenes were difficult to oxidize over OMS-2-SH-B and very poor yields of final products were obtained (Table 3, entries 5 and 6). Finally, inspired by the results of Jiang's and Zhang's work [11,13], one‑carbon suppliers, such as DMF and DMSO, were used in the reactions to form biphenyl-substituted 1,3,5-triazines 3q (Scheme S10). The reactions using DMF or DMSO replacing alcohols proceeded smoothly and provided desired products in good yields, which offers a simple and straightforward pathway on synthesis. In order to investigate the stability of the optimal catalyst (OMS-2-SH-B), it was recycled and reused for 5 consecutive times with the reaction of benzyl alcohol and benzamidine under the optimized conditions. As shown in Fig. 2 , the catalyst shows very stable activity and could be reused for many times. After the first run, the reaction solution after removal of solid catalyst was analyzed by ICP-MS and the results imply that Mn and K were below 10 μg/L respectively. In addition, XRD patterns show that the catalyst retrieved after five recycles maintains cryptomelane phase very well (Scheme S11, in ESI). 4 Conclusion In summary, we developed a mixed-valent OMS-2 catalyst with enhanced surface area and high concentration of oxygen vacancy defects. The obtained catalyst exhibits excellent oxidative ability for oxidation of benzyl alcohols and catalytic performance in aerobic oxidative synthesis of 1,3,5-triazines. A broad array of benzyl alcohols and electron-rich toluenes were both tolerated in the reactions and offered 1,3,5-triazines in good to excellent yields. The catalytic system which is chemoselective, recyclable and base−/ligand-free provides a sustainable, simple and straightforward way to synthesize N-containing heterocycles.
