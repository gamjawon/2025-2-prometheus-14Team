Sulfination of acetanilide using liquid coordination complexes as dual catalyst and solvent Jinghua Shen Fumin Wang ⁎ Tianlei Wang Haichao Li Gang Wang Xubin Zhang ⁎ School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300072, PR China School of Chemical Engineering and Technology Tianjin University Tianjin 300072 PR China ⁎ Corresponding author. Graphical abstract The Freidel-Crafts sulfination reaction of acetanilide with sulfur dioxide was catalyzed by several AlCl3-based liquid coordination complexes (LCCs), and the results were compared with that catalyzed by traditional ILs. Influences of different catalysts, ligand/AlCl3 molar ratios, and reaction conditions on their catalytic performance were investigated. The optimal result was obtained using acetamide-AlCl3-based LCC (molar ratio of acetamide to AlCl3 was 0.65, marked as 0.65 A A/AlCl3) as the catalyst, giving nearly 100% conversion of acetanilide within 60 min and 94.07% of selectivity to 4-acetamidobenzenesulfinic acid. AA/AlBr3 was synthesized and also showed catalytic activity for the sulfination reaction. Then a plausible reaction mechanism was proposed by investigation through the raman spectra. Keywords Acetanilide Freidel-Crafts sulfination Liquid coordination complexes AlCl3-based 1 Introduction Sulfinic acids and their salts are a class of industrially important intermediates extensively used for the preparation of various organic compounds with sulfonyl motifs (-SO2-). Several methods have been described for the synthesis of sulfinates, including reduction of the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides [1,2], the oxidation of thiols [3], iron-catalyzed radical coupling reaction [4], Freidel-Crafts sulfination reaction [5,6] and so on [7–9]. Freidel-Crafts sulfination reaction-based routes are the most straightforward approaches to make sulfonates. However, the use of an over stoichiometric amounts of Lewis acids such as AlCl3 and implemented regulations to limit the use of volatile organic solvents can induce serious environmental hazards and safety problems, especially in industrial-scale processes. Lewis acidic ionic liquids (ILs), especially those chloroaluminate ILs, have been thoroughly studied [10–12] as alternatives to conventional solvents and catalysts due to their unique physicochemical properties. Some significant progress has been made in their catalytic applications such as in Friedel-Crafts chemistry [13–15], Diels-Alder reactions [16], Condensation [17], Isomerization and Oligomerization [18,19]. Despite their excellent catalytic performance, they suffer from some inherent drawbacks, such as moisture sensitivity, high toxicity and cost, and preparation complexity. Less investigated alternatives are liquid coordination complexes (LCCs) based on the mixtures of metal halides and donor molecules. As a new generation of liquid Lewis acids, LCCs not only have the potential to inherently own all the remarkable properties of ILs, but are superior to traditional ILs in terms of cost and ease of preparation. Moreover, the much wide spectrum of species in LCCs provides routes for the broad ranges of Lewis acidities and redox potentials [20], which have gained widespread attention in recent years. Abbott et al. [21–23] reported the mixtures of simple amides and AlCl3 could form ILs with mental-containing anions and cations. Coleman et al. [20] studied the speciation of the liquid systems formed by AlCl3 and donor molecules with different molar ratios, and identified the existence of equilibrated cationic, anionic and neutral coordination complexes of AlCl3. Hogg et al. [24] and Matuszek et al. [25] reported that LCCs based on AlCl3 exhibited better catalytic performance than traditional chloroaluminate ILs in the oligomerization of a-olefins and Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene. Hu et al. [26] used several amide-based LCCs to catalyze the alkylation of isobutene with 2-butene and investigated the effects of amide structure, amide/AlCl3 molar ratios, CuCl modification on their catalytic activities. However, there is very little literature about the Freidel-Crafts sulfination catalyzed by LCCs. In the present paper, several AlCl3-based LCCs were used as both solvent and catalyst in the Freidel-Crafts sulfination of acetanilide with SO2 to form the 4-Acetamidobenzenesulfinic acid, which could be used for synthesizing the important intermediate of reactive dyes. The results were compared with those catalyzed by traditional ILs. The effects of a range of variables on the sulfination procedure were studied together with the plausible reaction mechanism. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials All chemicals were used without further purification unless otherwise stated. Acetanilide (99%), acetamide (AA, 99%), N-methylacetamide (NMA, 99%), urea (Ur, 99%), thiourea (SUr, 99%), triethylamine hydrochloride (Et3NHCl, 99%), 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM]BF4, 99%) and anhydrous AlCl3 (99%) were purchased from Shanghai Molbase Biological Technology Co., Ltd. 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]Cl, 99%), anhydrous FeCl3 (>98%) and AlBr3 (>98%) were purchased from Aladin chemistry company. SO2 (99.99%) were obtained from Baoding North Special Gases Co., Ltd. 2.2 Preparation of LCCs and ILs LCCs and Et3NHCl/AlCl3 ionic liquid with different ligand/metal halide molar ratios were synthesized under a nitrogen atmosphere and typical experiments were described as below. The donor ligands were slowly added over 30 min to weighed amounts of metal halide in a 100 ml three-neck flask placed in the oil bath with mechanical stirring. Then the mixture was heated to 80 ℃ and remained constant until homogeneous liquid was obtained. [BMIM]Cl/AlCl3 and [BMIM]Cl/FeCl3 were prepared by slowly adding weighed individual AlCl3 and FeCl3, respectively to the imidazolium salt, then left overnight with stirring at room temperature to obtain the homogeneous mixture. 2.3 General sulfination reaction procedure The sulfination of acetanilide with SO2 was carried out in a 50 ml three-neck flask with magnetic stirrer under a dry nitrogen atmosphere. In a typical run, 0.27 g (2 mmol) of acetanilide was charged into the 50 ml flask containing 43 mmol solvents with constant stirring. 2 equivalents of SO2 were fed into the solvents after acetanilide was completely dissolved. The reaction was carried out at 90 ℃ and reacted for selected period of time with continuous stirring. After completion of the reaction, the liquid mixture was cooled to room temperature and immediately analyzed with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The detailed product isolation procedure and analysis were described in the Supplementary Material. 2.4 General solubility measurement procedure of SO2 Measurement of SO2 solubility in the solvents was carried out under the ambient pressure. The detailed method was described in the Supplementary Material. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Acetanilide-SO2 sulfination catalyzed by LCCs and ionic liquids For both LCCs and ionic liquids, the different ligands can greatly influence the catalytic performance of catalysts. Various ionic liquids and AlCl3-based LCCs were used to catalyze the sulfination of acetanilide with SO2 and the results obtained are presented in Table 1 . The most investigated [BMIM]- and Et3NHCl-based ILs were chosen to represent the traditional acidic ILs, and donor ligands for LCCs were selected include O-donors (AA, Ur), N-donor (NMA), S-donor (SUr). [BMIM]BF4 and [BMIM]Cl/FeCl3 were not active and none of the product was formed in these mixtures (entries 5 and 6). The [BMIM]Cl/AlCl3 with stronger Lewis acidity showed activity, indicating that the acidity plays a major role in their catalytic performance (entry 7). The SUr could directly react with sulfur dioxide, leading to the deactivation of SUr/AlCl3 in the sulfination reaction with no acetanilide conversion observed (entry 4). Whereas, all other AlCl3-based catalysts exhibited great catalytic activity and excellent SO2 absorption capacity (Fig. S5) in this reaction, giving almost 100% of acetanilide conversion and 90.03–94.07% yield to desired product (entries 1–3 and 8). Effect of different ligands on the reaction rate was then studied and the results are illustrated in Fig. 1 . It was observed that reaction rate for the sulfination reaction catalyzed by LCCs was much faster than that of Et3NHCl/AlCl3 ionic liquid. AA/AlCl3 showed the superior reactivity over other catalysts, giving 76.79% conversion of acetanilide over 10 min and nearly 100% conversion within 60 min. However, Et3NHCl/AlCl3 exhibited a relatively flat reaction rate throughout the reaction and took more than 3 h to reach the complete conversion of acetanilide. Activity differences between these catalysts might be explained on basis of their Lewis acidity. In order to better understand the reaction mechanism and correlations between the acidity and activity in sulfination reactions, we used acetonitrile as a probe molecule to determine the Lewis acidity of these catalysts by infrared spectroscopy [27]. Pure acetonitrile has two characteristic CN stretching bands at 2293 cm−1 (band 2) and 2252 cm−1 (band 1). The addition of acetonitrile to Lewis acidic ionic liquids results in the appearance of a new band (band 3) at 2300–2400 cm−1. All the three bands shift to higher wavenumbers with increasing acidity, with band 2 being more sensitive than others. FIIR spectra in Fig. 2 show the new band appearing at 2337 cm−1 when acetonitrile was mixed with the catalysts, indicating the presence of Lewis acidic sites. Moreover, the different degrees of high wavenumber offset (band 2) of these catalysts demonstrated that the Lewis acidity increases in the order Et3NHCl/AlCl3 < NMA/AlCl3 < Ur/AlCl3 < AA/AlCl3 < SUr/AlCl3. The result was in accord with the reactivity order illustrated in Fig. 1 except for SUr/AlCl3 that interacted with SO2. It also indicated that the acidity of LCCs was stronger than that of traditional Et3NHCl/AlCl3 ionic liquid, and the strong Lewis acidity was benefit for sulfination reaction. Hence AA/AlCl3 was taken up for further investigations. 3.2 Influence of AA/AlCl3 molar ratios Effect of different AA/AlCl3 molar ratios on the catalytic performance is given in Table 2 . The catalytic activity of AA/AlCl3 was increased with the AA/AlCl3 molar ratio variation from 0.95 to 0.65. Reactions could not be observed until the AA/AlCl3 molar ratio reduced to 0.75. In addition, reaction rate became faster with the 1 h acetanilide conversion increased from 84.10% to 100% when the molar ratio changed from 0.75 to 0.65. However, we could not get the homogeneous liquid catalyst in LCC synthesis procedure when the AA/AlCl3 molar ratio further dropped to 0.55, which made it unfavorable to the reaction. These results might be attributed to the different speciation in AA/AlCl3 system. Two peaks of [Al2Cl7]− (314 cm-1) and [AlCl4]− (349 cm-1) were observed in the raman spectra of AA/AlCl3 with different molar ratios, as shown in Fig. 3 . For the catalysts with AA/AlCl3 molar ratios of 0.95 and 0.85, neutral [AlCl4]− was the dominant species in the system and made the catalyst exhibited weak Lewis acidic leading to no reactivity for the sulfination reaction. When AA/AlCl3 molar ratio decreased from 0.95 to 0.65, the asymmetric splitting degree of AlCl3 increased accompanied with more molecular species transformed into ionic species and more [AlCl4]- transformed into [Al2Cl7]- (Formulas 1 and 2 [20,28]). Whereas both the cationic Al species [AlCl2Ln]+ and [Al2Cl7]− were Lewis acidic, and in turn improved activity of the catalysts. These results also suggested that the catalytic activity of catalyst increased with the increasing of Lewis acidity. Hence a suitable AA/AlCl3 molar ratio for the sulfination is suggested to be 0.65.

Reaction temperature can markedly affect both the reaction rate and selectivity of desired product. In addition, TGA curve (Fig. S3) shows the excellent thermal stability of the liquid. The conversion of acetanilide increased significantly with the reaction temperature increasing from 15 to 110 ℃. The full conversion of acetanilide could be reached within selected period of time when temperature was higher than 90 ℃. Selectivity was slightly affected at temperatures below 90 ℃, however, an obvious decrease of selectivity was observed with the temperature further raised to 110 ℃. Therefore, 90 ℃ was selected as the optimal reaction temperature. Fig. 5 shows the effect of reaction time on the sulfination reaction. The acetanilide sulfination with SO2 is a fast reaction, thus, the complete conversion of acetanilide could be reached within 60 min. In addition, the reaction rate was very high during the first 20 min of the reaction and then gradually got slower with reaction time. It was suggested that the reaction might belong to a second order reaction in kinetics (Fig. S6). Reaction time had a slight influence on the selectivity which was almost unchanged as the reaction proceeded. 3.4 Influence of AlBr3 Compared with the AlCl3-based systems, aluminum bromide has much lower bond energy that has to be broken for the symmetric or asymmetric cleavage, which may greatly improve their catalytic performance [29]. Consequently, we synthesized the AA/AlBr3 LCC and applied it in the sulfination of acetanilide with SO2, as shown in Table 3 . To our delight that AA/AlBr3 also shows activity for the sulfination reaction and temperature can markedly influence the results of the procedure. The reaction proceeded much slower at a relatively low temperature, in comparison to that catalyzed by AA/AlCl3 at the same temperature. Whereas, none of the desired product was detected in HPLC analysis when the reaction temperature was further raised up to 90 ℃. No reaction took place at high temperatures suggested that the activation of the reactants by AA/AlBr3 required a relatively low temperature. The slower reaction rate exhibited by AlBr3-based system at low temperature might be mainly attributed to its higher density and viscosity, which was not beneficial for the dispersion of SO2 in the liquid catalyst. 3.5 A mechanism of sulfination reaction catalyzed by LCCs In order to explore the sulfination mechanism catalyzed by LCCs, raman spectra of the solvents before and after SO2 absorption were analyzed, as shown in Fig. 6 . It can be seen from Fig. 6a that the spectra of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) saturated with SO2 showed the typical ν 1 (SO2) S − O symmetric stretching band at 1150 cm−1. The data is consistent with the value of 1145 cm−1 for the liquid SO2 reported before [30]. When SO2 was fed into the AA/AlCl3, the typical ν 1 (SO2) S − O band appeared but shifted to a higher wavenumber (Fig. 6b), indicating the existence of interaction between SO2 and the liquid system. Moreover, the intensity of Lewis acidic species [Al2Cl7]- decreased with the increasing intensity of [AlCl4]- after the mixture of SO2 and the liquid. On the basis of these phenomena mentioned above, a plausible sulfination mechanism of acetanilide with SO2 catalyzed by AA/AlCl3 was shown in Scheme 1 . The Friedel-Craft sulfination reaction started with the activation of SO2 by Lewis acidic species to form the AlX3 adduct of SO2 [6] (Scheme 1). The SO2 adduct could be the key intermediate of Friedel–Crafts sulfination. Then the intermediate attacked acetanilide to generate the coordinated product, which yielded the corresponding product of 4-acetamidobenzenesulfinic acid. 4 Conclusions Several AlCl3-based LCCs were applied to catalyze the Freidel-Crafts sulfination reaction of acetanilide with SO2. Compared to the traditional methods for the synthesis of sulfinates, the reaction could be carried out more quickly and efficiently without the limitations of volatile organic solvents. The influences of different catalysts, AA/AlCl3 molar ratios, and reaction conditions on their catalytic performance were investigated. Under the same ligand/AlCl3 molar ratio, AA/AlCl3 exhibited superior reactivity over other catalysts, giving nearly 100% conversion of acetanilide within 60 min and 94.07% of selectivity to 4-Acetamidobenzenesulfinic acid. AA/AlBr3 was synthesized and applied to catalyze reactions which also showed activity for the sulfination reaction. Finally, measurement of SO2 solubility indicated LCCs were excellent solvents for this reaction and a plausible reaction mechanism was proposed by investigation through the raman spectra.
