Fig. 1 Catalytic cycle for ORR on a codoped Fe SAC in acidic aqueous conditions. The catalytic cycle proceeds clockwise: from the resting state (1) in oxidation state n = II/III, SACs−OO (2) formation with O2 oxidant, followed by a SACs−OOH intermediate (3), water release to form a SACs=O intermediate (4), and proton addition to form a SACs−OH intermediate (5). Path I is the outer loop passing from (1) to (5) sequentially. Path II only involves intermediates (1), (2), and (3) and corresponds to the inner loop. The structures are shown in the ball-and-stick representation and colored as follows: Fe in orange, O in red, N in blue, C in gray, and H in white. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Fig. 2 Scaling relationships for the binding energies (in kcal/mol) on the codoped Fe(II) and Ru(II) SACs with ΔE(O) as a descriptor. Pearson's r values are shown inset. The data points are colored by metal identities (Fe in red and Ru in purple). The four panes illustrate Fe(II) ΔE(OOH) vs. ΔE(O) energetics (top left), Fe(II) ΔE(OH) vs. ΔE(O) energetics (top right), Ru(II) ΔE(OOH) vs. ΔE(O) energetics (bottom left), and Ru(II) ΔE(OH) vs. ΔE(O) energetics (bottom right). Data point shapes indicate spin state (LS as circles and IS as triangles). The solid lines are linear fits for the LS codoped SACs and the dashed lines are equivalent fits for IS systems. Zero axes are shown on all plots as solid black lines. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Fig. 3 Comparison of different ML models in predicting ΔE(O) (purple), ΔE(OH) (red), and ΔE(OOH) (green) energetics, evaluated using the mean absolute error (MAE) in kcal/mol. The RF, linear regression, GPR, and RFA GPR models utilize the RACs as the feature set. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Fig. 4 The ΔE(OOH) vs. ΔE(O) energetics (left) and ΔE(OH) vs. ΔE(O) energetics (right) for the expanded chemical space of codoped Fe/Ru SACs. The explicit data points are colored by data types (original, i.e., calculated, in blue and predicted with ML models in red) and their marginal distributions are shown as box-and-whisker plots.

The efficiency and performance required of practical devices for these processes mandates catalysts with high activity and stability to overcome the intrinsically sluggish kinetics of ORR [5]. Despite its importance, optimization of catalysts for ORR presents significant challenges [6]. Noble metal-based ORR catalysts, such as Pt/C-based electrocatalysts, [7–9] have been well-developed and show good activity [9,10]. However, the high cost, scarcity, and long-term stability issues of Pt-based catalysts means they cannot meet the increasing demand and these limitations greatly hinder large-scale commercial applications [11,12]. The importance of ORR thus calls for deeper understanding of its mechanism and development of novel catalysts, which would unlock new possibilities for energy conversion technologies. Single-atom catalysts (SACs), [13–20] featuring isolated metal atoms dispersed on solid supports, have emerged as a promising class of catalysts for a wide range of electrochemical reactions due to their unique electronic and geometric properties, [21,22] as well as their high metal atom economy [23–25]. Compared to traditional nanoparticle-based catalysts, [26–29] the unsaturated coordination environments and unique electronic structures of SACs have led to improved catalytic performance and shown promising potential for use in ORR catalysis [30–33]. Experimental studies have demonstrated the significant potential of doped graphitic SACs with various codoping configurations for ORR, including N/S and N/P codopants in the first coordination sphere, [34–37] as well as configurations with N in the first and P or S in the second coordination sphere [32,38]. However, codoped SACs in which two or more heteroatoms are incorporated into the catalyst structure require further computational investigation to improve guidance for experimental synthesis efforts. Our previous work [39] investigated the codoping effect (e.g., NO, NP, NS, OS, OP, PS) with a wide range of coordination configurations of SACs for methane-to-methanol conversion, which shares many intermediates (i.e., oxo intermediates and hydroxo intermediates) with ORR. The results indicated that engineering the coordination environment near single metal sites can modulate structural and electronic properties, altering the energetics of reactions and catalytic performance. Therefore, manipulating the coordination sphere around the metal atom through codoping is expected to be an effective approach to establish structure–property relationships and design efficient SACs for ORR applications as well. Scaling relationships [40–42] computed with density functional theory (DFT) have become a crucial tool in computational catalysis for understanding the principles governing catalytic activity and selectivity [43–48]. However, emerging catalysts such as SACs may deviate from the established scaling relationships for ORR, [49,50] which presents both an opportunity to design catalysts that are active for multiple steps without a tradeoff but also introduces a bottleneck compared to traditional single-descriptor-based catalyst screening. To overcome this limitation, the combination of virtual high-throughput screening (VHTS) [39,51–54] and machine learning (ML) [55–60] as well as iterative computational and experimental study [61] hold great promise in accelerating materials development. VHTS facilitates rapid evaluation of an extensive library of catalyst candidates and identification of promising compounds. ML models, learning from vast experimental and computational data, can predict reaction energetics with higher accuracy [40,62–65] than scaling relationships by capturing intricate patterns through incorporating a wide range of features [65–67]. Leveraging VHTS and ML can accelerate the rational design of SACs and other catalytic materials, expediting the discovery of novel catalysts with enhanced performance for ORR. In this work, we employ VHTS and ML to investigate the potential of codoped SACs with Fe and Ru centers for optimizing ORR reaction energetics. Our ML models trained on this VHTS data predict the reaction energetics and catalytic performance of codoped SACs with higher accuracy than traditional scaling relationships. Our findings highlight the potential of codoping as a powerful strategy to tune the properties of SACs and overcome the limitations of traditional SAC design approaches. 2 Reaction mechanism We calculate the reaction energetics of ORR for Fe and Ru codoped SACs in two oxidation states (i.e., M(II) and M(III)). All the catalytic intermediates were examined at both low spin (LS) and intermediate spin (IS), with the spin states selected based on those that are accessible for both the resting state M(II/III) and the oxidized M(IV/V)=O intermediate. Specifically, these spin states correspond to LS doublet/IS quartet for 3d3 Fe(V)=O or 4d3 Ru(V)=O and LS singlet/IS triplet for 3d4 Fe(IV)=O or 4d4 Ru(IV)=O. High-spin states were omitted because they are not accessible for the M(V)=O species, although they could be of interest in future work focused solely on optimizing M(II) and M(IV)=O catalysts. The preferred pathway and the overall efficiency of ORR depend on a few factors, such as the catalyst material, surface structure, electrolyte composition, and operating conditions [42,68–71]. The reaction scheme of O2 reduction in acidic aqueous conditions is believed to follow two possible pathways: the direct four-electron pathway (path I), where O2 is reduced directly to H2O, and the indirect two-electron pathway (path II), which involves the formation of H2O2 (Fig. 1 ) [72,73]. Due to the higher selectivity for oxygen reduction and efficiency of the four-electron pathway [62], we primarily focus on path I. The catalytic cycle for ORR starts from the resting state structure (1). The first step is the adsorption of O2 onto the metal center of the SAC, the energy of which can be computed as follows: (1) Δ E 1 → 2 = E ( 2 ) - E 1 - E O 2 After the formation of the SACs−OO (2) (i.e., typically called OO* in ORR studies) M(II/III) intermediate, adsorbed O2 receives the first electron from an external source along with a proton (e.g., from H2O dissociation) to form the SACs−OOH intermediate (3) in an M(III/IV) oxidation state. While the proton source can be accounted for in a number of ways, we compute the reaction energy for this step as: (2) Δ E 2 → 3 = E 3 - E 2 - 1 2 E H 2 For the path I mechanism, the SACs−OOH intermediate (3) receives a second electron and releases OH− in the form of H2O to form an oxo intermediate (4, SACs=O), with a reaction energy computed as follows: (3) Δ E 3 → 4 = E ( 4 ) - E ( 3 ) + E H 2 O - 1 2 E H 2 This species has a metal center nominally in an M(IV/V) oxidation state. In the final step of the path I reaction, the SACs=O intermediate (4) accepts the third electron and a proton to form a SACs−OH intermediate (5) in the M(III/IV) oxidation state. The reaction energy for this step is calculated as: (4) Δ E 4 → 5 = E ( 5 ) - E ( 4 ) - 1 2 E H 2 To complete the catalytic cycle, the SACs−OH intermediate (5) gains the fourth electron and a proton to desorb OH− as H2O, and the catalyst returns it to the resting state (1). We calculate the reaction energy in this step as: (5) Δ E 5 → 1 = E 1 - E 5 + E H 2 O - 1 2 E H 2 When we compute reaction energies, we conserve the nominal spin state assignments, comparing either only LS intermediates or only IS intermediates. When we add a radical to the SAC, we add its spin in a ferromagnetic (i.e., spin up) convention. In addition to the reaction energetics, a key descriptor that is often used to describe ORR is the binding energy of the reaction intermediates to the metal sites of the SACs (i.e., SACs=O, SACs-OH, SACs-OOH). The binding energies of the reactive intermediates (ΔE(OOH), ΔE(O), and ΔE(OH)) are calculated using the following equations: (6) Δ E ( O O H ) = E ( 3 ) - E ( 1 ) - 2 E H 2 O + 3 2 E H 2 (7) Δ E O = E ( 4 ) - E ( 1 ) - E H 2 O + E H 2 (8) Δ E O H = E 5 - E 1 - E H 2 O + 1 2 E H 2 In all cases throughout, the energy of H2O and H2 are computed in the gas phase, and these choices for balancing each reaction are motivated by prior observations of errors in DFT for computing oxygen energetics [42,68]. In fact, only equation (1) invokes the energetics of O2, which are notoriously difficult for DFT [74], and the focus of our analysis is primarily on relationships between Eqns 6–8, which circumvents incorporating catalyst-specific DFT errors in our analysis. 3 Computational Details All gas-phase geometry optimizations and single-point energy calculations were performed using DFT with a development version of the GPU-accelerated electronic structure code TeraChem v1.9 [75]. The range-separated hybrid functional ωPBEh [76] (default ω = 0.2 bohr−1) was employed for all calculations throughout our work. The range separation parameter tunes between 20% HF exchange in the short range and 100% in the long range. This functional was employed with the LACVP* composite basis set, which consists of a LANL2DZ effective core potential [77,78] for Fe and Ru and the 6-31G* basis for all other atoms. The choice of the ωPBEh functional was made to prevent the occurrence of the unphysical HOMO–LUMO gap closing observed in larger systems when using global hybrid functionals [79,80]. All closed-shell singlet calculations were carried out in a spin-restricted formalism and all other calculations were in a spin-unrestricted formalism that employed level shifting [81] of 0.25 Ha for both majority- and minority-spin virtual orbitals to enable the convergence of the self-consistent field (SCF). The default SCF convergence threshold of 3x10-5 hartree for the direct inversion of the iterative subspace (DIIS) error was employed. All geometry optimizations were carried out using the translation-rotation-internal coordinate (TRIC) [82] optimizer with default tolerances: a maximum gradient of 4.5 × 10−4 hartree/bohr and an energy difference between steps of 1 × 10-6 hartree. The initial 412 Fe and 497 Ru codoped SACs, each from a possible set of 512 unique configurations, were adapted from the optimized codoped SACs dataset of our prior work (Supporting Information Table S1) [39]. Any prior calculations that did not pass checks for quality in geometric or electronic structure were discarded in prior work and thus were not used here. A complete set of all initial structures is provided in the associated Zenodo repository. We first optimized the LS state oxo intermediate with the M=O bond distance initially set to 1.65 Å. The initial metal-hydroxo intermediate was generated using the optimized metal-oxo intermediate as a starting point, to which an H atom was added to the oxygen atom (Supporting Information Fig. S1). In a similar fashion, the metal-hydroperoxo intermediate was initialized by adding a hydroxyl group to the optimized metal-oxo intermediate (Supporting Information Fig. S1). After optimizing the metal-hydroxo and metal-hydroperoxo intermediate, the corresponding resting state and metal-O2 intermediate were generated by removing the hydroxyl group and hydrogen atom, respectively. All IS state SAC intermediates were optimized from the corresponding pre-optimized LS state structures (Supporting Information Table S2). All job submissions were automated through the job manager in molSimplify [83], with a 72-hour wall time per run cutoff and a maximum of five resubmissions allowed for each job [60]. If an intermediate optimization failed, subsequent downstream intermediate optimizations were not executed. The converged structures were excluded from the dataset based on established protocols [20,39,51] if: 1) the expectation value of the S 2 operator, <S 2>, deviated from the expected value of S(S + 1) by > 1; 2) the sum of the Mulliken spin density on the metal and oxygen differed from the spin multiplicity by > 1 μB; or 3) geometric deviations were caused by the oxo moiety inserting itself into bonds between the metal and the coordinating atoms or the structure differed from the corresponding initial structure by a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) > 0.6 Å. Because we only require that the spin be on either the metal or the oxygen, some of the formed M=O species could have oxyl character, as was studied more thoroughly in prior work [51] on metal-oxos in transition metal complexes. Nevertheless, the constraint on spin contamination from allowed values of <S 2> likely leads to elimination of the cases with the most extreme radical character. All machine learning models were trained with a random train/test split of 80:20. The linear model and random forest models were trained using scikit-learn, while GPy was used for the GPR models. The model featurization included a set of 67 standard revised autocorrelation (RAC) [84] functions up to a depth of 4, as generated in molSimplify [83] (Supporting Information Table S3). A binding energy descriptor was also added to some models. In all cases, features were normalized over training data to zero mean and unit variance. All hyperparameters used in the models are provided in Supporting Information Tables S4–S6. These corresponded to default hyperparameters for the linear model and random forest models, and the maximum likelihood was optimized for GPR model hyperparameter selection. The resulting trained models are provided in our Zenodo repository. Features from random forest pre-ranked feature lists were sequentially added until model performance did not improve, as in prior work [84]. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Scaling relationships of codoped Fe/Ru SACs The correlations between binding energies of reaction intermediates on a catalyst surface, which are known as scaling relationships, [40–42] have become a central concept in computational catalysis. Scaling relationships can be leveraged to discover and optimize catalysts by identifying the key descriptors that determine catalytic performance. For the rational design of catalysts for ORR, scaling relationships between the surface binding energies of OOH*, O*, and OH* intermediates (where * indicates surface adsorption) in ORR typically exhibit strong positive linear correlations for heterogeneous catalysts [45–47,85–90]. Nonetheless, emerging catalysts like SACs may diverge from established scaling relationships for ORR [49,50]. Given the widespread application of scaling relationships to simplify complex catalytic cycles into single descriptors, we aimed to determine whether a diverse chemical space of codoped transition metal SACs follows established scaling relationships [44,91] for ORR, particularly concerning the period dependence (i.e., Fe vs. Ru). Over the codoped Fe/Ru SACs dataset, we observe that the ΔE(OOH) and ΔE(OH) binding energies are positively, albeit weakly, correlated to ΔE(O) (Fig. 2 ). These linear scaling relationships are expected to originate from the fact that all the adsorbates bind to the metal active site through an oxygen atom. We assessed the impact of a 3d vs. 4d metal (i.e., Fe(II) vs. Ru(II)) on the scaling relationships of ΔE(O) vs. ΔE(OOH) and ΔE(O) vs. ΔE(OH) binding energies in codoped SACs. For ΔE(O) vs. ΔE(OOH) energetics, LS codoped Fe(II) SACs and LS codoped Ru(II) SACs show comparable scaling relationships (Supporting Information Table S7). In LS codoped Fe(II) SAC systems, ΔE(OH) exhibits a linear scaling relation with ΔE(O) with a Pearson's r of 0.70, which is similar to the equivalent linear scaling relationship in LS codoped Ru(II) SACs with a Pearson's r of 0.69 (Supporting Information Table S7). A striking difference in linear free energy relationship (LFER) slopes is observed between the LS and IS states in Fe(II), but this effect is smaller for Ru(II) (Fig. 2). To investigate the impact of spin states (i.e., LS vs. IS) on scaling relationships in codoped transition metal SACs, we focused on the ΔE(O) vs. ΔE(OOH) and ΔE(O) vs. ΔE(OH) binding energies of both LS and IS Fe(II) and Ru(II) codoped SACs. The Ru(II) codoped SACs exhibit comparable scaling relationships (i.e., similar slope) for ΔE(O) vs. ΔE(OOH) and ΔE(O) vs. ΔE(OH) binding energies in the two spin states. However, the IS systems have a steeper slope than their LS counterparts in codoped Fe(II) SACs (Fig. 2). We also compared the scaling relationships between three individual reaction energies, which correspond to steps in the catalytic cycle outlined in eqs. 2–4. We observe a higher correlation between the oxo formation reaction energy and the hydroxo formation reaction energy than we do for the hydroperoxo formation step (Supporting Information Fig. S2 and Table S8). The MAEs of these fits are mostly in line with the Pearson's r values, with MAEs generally around 3–4 kcal/mol for the hydroxo reaction energy and 5–6 kcal/mol for the hydroperoxo (Supporting Information Fig. S2 and Table S8). Focusing on specific candidates that have downhill binding energies for all three ORR intermediates, we observe that the LS Fe(II) or Ru(II) catalysts are typically better overall candidates than the IS cases (Fig. 2 and Supporting Information Fig. S2). It is not possible for us to straightforwardly calculate volcano plots in a single-descriptor picture due to the scaling relations no longer holding. Nevertheless, we focus on trends that make each binding energy step closest to a moderate binding energy, expecting that these will yield the most active catalysts. Within each spin/metal combination, the dopant choice has a large effect on energetics, especially on ΔE(O) (Fig. 2). For the SACs with the most favorable energetics for ΔE(O), we observe there are typically both oxygen and phosphorus dopants in the vicinity of the metal with IS Ru(II) or alternatively a single O or S dopant when combined with an MN4 active site (Supporting Information Table S9). The inclusion of stronger-field dopants such as phosphorus will serve to stabilize the LS state as the ground state, giving LS OP candidates (i.e., those with both oxygen and phosphorus dopant atoms) a high probability of also being in their ground state. This observation of favorable 3p dopant energetics is consistent with our observations for C–H activation [39] as well as very recent experimental observations [92] that incorporation of heavier dopants improves ORR reactivity. In the case of ΔE(OOH), we observe similar trends, with both OP and NP dopant combinations with LS, or in some cases IS, states being the most favorable (Supporting Information Table S9). Finally, for ΔE(OH), some SACs have OP dopants, but the most favorable binders are those with single dopants (i.e., only O or P) in the presence of an MN4 active site, with the majority in LS states (Supporting Information Table S9). The ΔG(OH) with respect to a final state with H2O is often used as a descriptor in heterogeneous catalysis screening [93], which after thermodynamic corrections should be close to 0.8 eV (17 kcal/mol). The ten catalysts with the closest ΔE(OH) only include M(II) centers, six of which are Ru(II) LS and four of which are Fe(II) IS (Supporting Information Table S10). All dopants are well represented, with most (9 of 10) containing at least one nitrogen dopant, typically (6 of 10) in combination with O or P (Supporting Information Table S10). Thus, overall, our analysis suggests combinations of 2p O and 3p P dopants directly coordinating the metal could be a useful strategy for optimizing ORR catalysis. For both LS codoped Fe and Ru SACs, the ΔE(O) vs. ΔE(OH) binding energy scaling relationship has a slope close to that of bulk metal heterogeneous catalysts (i.e., on their (111) surface), corresponding to a slope near 0.5, but scatter is greater in the SAC data [42]. We also make comparison to previously studied TM@C2N SACs, where we observe that our correlation in codoped SACs (R2 = 0.32) is weaker than that of previously studied TM@C2N SACs (R2 of 0.86), likely because the TM@C2N SACs were studied with closed-shell DFT [62], and we generally observe stronger scaling relations for closed-shell singlets even if they are not the ground state spin of the catalyst [51]. This relatively weak correlation across all of the data in our codoped Fe/Ru SAC systems can be attributed to a combination of treatment of different spin states as well as high variation of the coordination environment (i.e., atom identities and geometry) resulting in increased scatter relative to scaling relationships obtained for other systems. In addition, weaker linear correlations are observed for our codoped SACs in their IS state than their LS state for both metals. We have previously observed that LFERs hold much better in LS states than in IS or HS states [39,51,94] in a range of other single-site transition metal catalysts, suggesting that greater flexibility of bonding in cases with unpaired electrons leads to greater opportunity to disrupt scaling relationships. The large deviation from linear scaling relationships owing to the varied local coordination geometry and metal spin state makes codoped SACs more tunable materials for their catalytic performance across the energy landscape. This set of codoped SACs with the weakest linear correlations among different binding energy descriptors would benefit the most from independent ML model predictions that do not rely on these scaling relationships. 4.2 Machine learning models for predicting reaction energetics Given the both weak and spin-state-dependent scaling relations between binding energies in the oxygen reduction reaction, we next investigated training independent ML models to predict binding energies (i.e., ΔE(O), ΔE(OH), and ΔE(OOH)) at low cost. To maintain low computational cost, we employed as our molecular representations the graph-based RAC descriptors [84]. RACs have been successfully applied for building structure–property relationships in transition metal complexes [60,95,96] and metal–organic frameworks [97–99]. RACs are sums of products (or differences) of heuristic atomic properties (e.g., nuclear charge, Pauling electronegativity, topology, etc.) on the molecular graph. Using RACs, we trained and compared random forest (RF), linear regression, and Gaussian process regression (GPR) models as surrogates for DFT calculations (see Computational Details and Supporting Information Tables S3–S6). If successful, these models would make it possible to explore larger spaces of candidate SACs at much lower than DFT cost (see Sec. 4.3). Comparing the three models, the GPR model on the full feature vector outperforms both RF and linear models (Fig. 3 , Supporting Information Table S11). All RFA-GPR models have the lowest test set accuracies around 5.7–6.7 kcal/mol, whereas the linear and random forest model errors are higher (7.4–12.6 kcal/mol), especially for ΔE(O) (Supporting Information Table S11). These errors are comparable to the errors we had for LFER relationships that describe IS codoped Fe(II) SAC systems and LS codoped Ru(II) SAC systems but better than LFER relationships for IS codoped Ru(II) SAC systems (Supporting Information Table S7). In particular, high errors in the linear model for ΔE(O) can be attributed to the poor fit of a presumed linear relationship between features and ΔE(O). To improve the GPR model performance, we employ recursive feature addition GPR (RFA-GPR) to predict ΔE(O), ΔE(OH), and ΔE(OOH) energetics based on RACs. Using a set of features marked as important (with a threshold of 2% error introduced by omission from the RF model) by RF, we recursively add these features (i.e., RFA) to the GPR model until performance is not improved. The resulting RFA-GPR model shows reduced errors especially for O and OH (Fig. 3). Thus, eliminating uninformative features greatly improves performance of ML models for predicting catalyst energetics on datasets of modest size. Given the fact that our ML models are predicting with an accuracy comparable to that obtained from LFERs, we investigated whether using DFT binding energies as inputs (i.e., from ΔE(O)), as would be also incorporated into a standard LFER, could improve the accuracy of model predictions of other binding energies (i.e., for ΔE(OH) and ΔE(OOH)), albeit at increased computational cost of model evaluation. Alternatively, we investigated whether a predicted ΔE(O) value (i.e., from an RFA-GPR model) could also improve model accuracy. Our results show that adding DFT-computed ΔE(O) to the feature set reduced test set error further from 6.1 kcal/mol to 3.4 kcal/mol for ΔE(OH) and 5.7 kcal/mol to 4.3 kcal/mol for ΔE(OOH) RFA-GPR models (Table 1 ). Nevertheless, this comes at a much higher computational cost. To avoid this extra cost, substituting DFT-calculated ΔE(O) with RFA-GPR-predicted ΔE(O) values resulted in a worse test set error of 6.7 kcal/mol for ΔE(OH) and an intermediate performance of 4.8 kcal/mol for ΔE(OOH) (Table 1). Overall, the standard RFA-GPR and DFT-informed RFA-GPR model demonstrate superior performance (i.e., MAEs of 3.4 kcal/mol vs. 6.7 kcal/mol) compared to the LFERs obtained for some subsets of metals and oxidation states in codoped SACs (i.e., IS Fe(II) codoped SACs and IS Ru(II) codoped SACs, Supporting Information Table S7). Thus, these models show promise for more predictive screening of large spaces of candidate SACs, albeit with accuracy that could be further improved through deep learning efforts that could leverage larger datasets. 4.3 Exploring 280,000 multiple-doped SACs with machine learning The RFA-GPR model, which incorporates the predicted ΔE(O) and RACs as input features, exhibited modestly improved predictive capabilities compared to conventional linear scaling relationships. To fully exploit the potential of this RFA-GPR model for the discovery of highly active codoped SACs for ORR, we aim to explore an expanded chemical space through an extensive computational screening approach. The chemical space is constructed based on an expansion of the codoped Fe/Ru SACs that were used during model training. Specifically, we employed a random selection process to choose a single C atom within the SAC flake, subsequently substituting this selected C atom with one alternative atom (i.e., N, O, P or S), which results in a new triple-doped SAC. This doping strategy introduces additional structural and electronic modifications to the local environment of the active metal site, potentially altering the catalytic properties. Through this systematic approach, we generate a diverse set of 69,526 distinct codoped SAC geometries within our expanded chemical space for subsequent screening. Together with the metal and spin state variation (i.e., four options for M(II) metals), we assemble a new space of almost 280,000 multiple-doped SACs. Next, we applied the RFA-GPR model to make predictions across the expanded chemical space of multiply-doped SACs. Specifically, we aimed to identify promising candidates that could potentially exhibit improved catalytic performance for ORR. ORR involves a series of elementary steps, with the binding energies of reaction intermediates such as OOH and OH playing a critical role in determining the overall catalytic activity. Our results indicated that the expanded chemical space, obtained through the random multiple-doping strategy, did not significantly extend the catalytic performance beyond the original space for both the ΔE(O) vs. ΔE(OOH) and ΔE(O) vs. ΔE(OH) reaction energetics (Fig. 4 ). Specifically, using binding energies typically suggested based on heterogeneous catalysis scaling relations [93], we would expect the optimal ΔE(OH) to be around 19 kcal/mol (0.85 eV), ΔE(O) to be double that around 39 kcal/mol (1.7 eV), and ΔE(OOH) to be 70–80 kcal/mol. While scaling relations generally hold less well over our dataset, we use these values as estimates to identify optimal regions for our catalysts (Fig. 4). There are both original datapoints and predicted datapoints with more heteroatoms in these regions (Fig. 4). This suggests that the introduction of heteroatom dopants outside the first and second coordination sphere may not substantially modify the local metal environment to further tune the catalytic activity for ORR. While the multiple-doping approach provided a diverse set of structures, the electronic and geometric variation induced by the heteroatom substitutions were not substantial enough to further extend the catalytic capability of Fe/Ru SAC systems. These results show the challenges of using ML surrogate models for extrapolation. They also underscore the complexity inherent in optimizing catalytic systems and highlight the necessity for further refinement in our approach to uncovering novel catalysts with enhanced performance characteristics. 5 Conclusions In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of codoped SACs with Fe and Ru centers for optimizing ORR energetics. Through VHTS and ML techniques, we explored a large chemical space of codoped SAC structures and identified promising OP-codopant candidates exhibiting enhanced ORR catalytic performance. Our results show that codoping significantly influences the electronic and geometric properties of SACs, enabling tunable catalytic activity and stability. The ML models trained on the VHTS data outperformed conventional scaling relationships in accurately predicting reaction energetics. This highlights the efficacy of combining computational screening and machine learning approaches for rational catalyst design and discovery. The ability to precisely control the dopant type, concentration, and local coordination environment through codoping emerges as a powerful strategy for tuning the electronic structure and catalytic properties of SACs. However, the triple-doped search with surrogate models did not uncover superior leads. This knowledge can guide future efforts in designing tailored SACs for various energy conversion and storage applications beyond ORR. This study paves the way for the rational development of advanced SAC-based catalysts through computational screening and machine learning techniques.

        "dc:description": "The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential in a range of energy conversion and storage technologies, including fuel cells and metal–air batteries. Single-atom catalysts (SACs), characterized by isolated metal atoms especially in doped graphitic substrates, have emerged as promising ORR catalysts due to their unique electronic and geometric properties. We employ virtual high-throughput screening (VHTS) with density functional theory and machine learning (ML) to explore the potential of codoped SACs with Fe and Ru centers for optimizing ORR reaction energetics. We also develop ML models, trained on VHTS data, that offer increased predictive accuracy of reaction energetics, surpassing the capabilities of conventional linear free energy relationship approaches. The results underscore codoping as an effective strategy for tuning SAC properties, enabling the rational design of high-performance ORR catalysts.",
