HOENIG AND MERVIN G. UTTER Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721 Received September 22, 1976 INTRODUCTION In an earlier paper (1) we discussed the observations of exoelectron emission associ- ated with catalytic oxidation of CO, H 2, and NHs over a heated palladium wire. Other data on the NO, +N3 reaction over hot monel was reported in (2). In every case it was possible to monitor the rate of reaction and to determine activa- tion energies from a measurement of the exoelectron current versus temperature. All of the experiments discussed in (1) and (e) were performed in a vacuum sys- tem at some 10~5 Torr and the wire cata- lysts were heated by ac through an isola- tion transformer. Some readers raised the questions of: (a) Could this technique be used for observation of catalytic reactions at atmospheric pressure? (b) Were some of the observed effects due to the electrical current passing through the catalyst? EXPERIMENTS AT 1 atm To settle some of these questions we con- structed the system shown in Fig. 1. The gas mixture was sampled upstream of the catalyst and again after the reaction had occurred. The exoelectron emission was col- lected by a stainless steel screen on the downstream side of the catalyst. 1 The support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is gratefully acknowledged. We note that when electrons arc emitted into a gas containing even a trace of oxygen, the electrons are immediately attached to oxygen molecules to form negative molecu- lar ions (3). It is these ions that were col- lected in the experiment and all references to exoelectron current should be under- stood to refer to a current of negative molecular ions. For these experiments the palladium wire catalyst (0.0254 cm diam) was sup- ported on a ceramic tube into which a 100 W rod heater had been inserted. The pal- ladium wire was electrically grounded to preclude the build-up of a charge but no electrical current was passed through the catalyst itself. Catalyst temperature was monitored by a small thermocouple just below the catalyst. The reaction coefficient \"K\" was taken as the ratio of the COs partial pressures at the inlet and outlet ends of the system. The numerical values of K are arbitrary because of changes in the mass spectrom- eter electron multiplier output with time and ambient gas pressure. The multiplier sensitivity remained effectively constant for a given run but changes over a period of weeks made it impractical to obtain an absolute value for the reaction coefficient. To compare the exoelectron data to the reaction constants -we plotted the exoelec- tron data in absolute terms, then the 210 Copyright 1977 by Academic Press, Inc.

It a given reactant to oxidizer mixture ratio. FIG. 2. Reaction constant (K) and exoelectron current (Ie) during catalytic oxidation of CH<. 212 HOENIG AND UTTER This would in turn suggest that the exo- electron technique could be used for moni- toring the rate of reaction. RESULTS The first experiments involved the oxida- tion of CH4 with atmospheric air. The mixture ratio was held below 5% to pre- clude the hazard of explosion. Initial CI experiments made use of natural gas, from El Paso Gas Co., with a charcoal trap to remove the mercaptans added as a signal of leaking gas. The results were erratic and the data reported below were obtained with \"commercial\" grade natural gas ob- tained from the Matheson Co. Mass spec- trometric analysis indicated that the nat- ural gas was some 93.6% CH4. The remain- der was a mixture of ethane and propane. Typical data for this reaction arc plotted in Fig. 2 as I, and K versus temperature for various CH4 to air ratios. The 4% CH4 Ie and K curves are essentially parallel suggesting that the electron current (Ze) could be used to monitor the rate of reac- tion. For 1% CH4 there is some deviation of slope between the two curves; this may be due to the effect of adsorption on the metallic work function. In any case the difference is small at 600 where a reac- tion of this type might be monitored. Similar data for the CO oxidation reac- tion is shown in Fig. 3. Here commercial tank oxygen was used instead of air because of the lower heat of reaction. In Fig. 3 the 12% curves for Ie and K are essentially parallel. At 2% there is some deviation which we ascribe to thermally induced elec- FIG. 3. Reaction constant (K) and exoelectron current (7 during catalytic oxidation of CO. EXOELECTRON EMISSION 213 tron emission. The results of a 0% (CO) level run are shown in Fig. 3. If the nu- merical values from the 0% curve are sub- tracted from the 2% Ie curve the resultant Ie ~ ^e(O) values are essentially parallel to the 2% K curve. Once again we suggest that the electron emission current is a con- venient way to monitor to catalytic reaction. DISCUSSION The mechanism relating catalysis to exo- electron emission is by no means clear. We suggest that electron emission is triggered by the adsorption-desorption cycle. Del- char (4) has reported electron emission as- sociated with the adsorption of oxygen on nickel ; if emission is due to adsorption the continuous adsorption-desorption cycle of catalysis would generate a steady current of electrons at a rate proportionate to the rate of reaction. A somewhat similar mechanism is the \"churning\" of the surface reported by Czanderna (o). This gross surface motion was associated by the author with oxygen adsorption and would effectively decrease the metallic work function thereby increas- ing the rate of electron emission. The data of Figs. 2 and 3 permit a cal- culation of the activation energy ( of of the reactions. In the case of Fig. 2 a straight line was drawn parallel to the 4% curves and the Ie and K values were used to calculate \"E.\" In all cases the formulas used were taken from Ref. (l) in the form J.I KZ -E/l or = exp I le K R 'T The results for the CH4 reaction, Fig. 2, were 7.8 and 7.7 kcal/mole. For Fig. 3, the CO reaction, the values were 7.8 and 7.0 kcal/mole. These data can be compared with those of Anderson et a (6) taken on a palladium catalyst supported on alumina. Activation energy values of 21.8 kcal/mole were ob- served in the 300-450 temperature range. The CH4 data may be compared with those of Bonzel and Ku (7) and the work of Palmer and Smith (8), both of which were done with platinum rather than palladium catalysts. Bonzel and Ku reported an ac- tivation energy of 2.9 kcal/mole while Palmer and Smith obtained a value of 20 kcal/mole. The very large differences be- tween these two results may have been due to the difference in experimental con- ditions; they are evidence of the problem of obtaining reliable activation energy data for these reactions. CONCLUSIONS We suggest that the exoelectron emission from the catalyst may be used to monitor the rate of oxidation of CO and CH4 over palladium catalysts. Indirect heating of the catalyst and atmospheric pressure have no effect upon this monitoring system. REFERENCES 1. Hoenig, S. A., and Tamjidi, F., J. Catal. 28, 200 (1973). 2. Hoenig, S.
