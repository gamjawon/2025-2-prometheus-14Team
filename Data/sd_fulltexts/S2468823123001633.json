Rh1/CeO2 attracts much attention in single-atom catalysis due to its unique catalytic performance and maximum atomic efficiency. Since different possible structures of Rh1/CeO2 coexist in real catalysts, it is hard to discriminate their catalytic roles and reaction mechanism due to the difficulty of preparing pure modeling catalyst. To solve this difficult problem, the adsorption and reaction behaviors of CO and O2 on four modeling catalysts of Rh1/CeO2 were systematically investigated by using density functional theory calculation in this work. The catalytic role and CO oxidation mechanism on Rh1/CeO2 catalysts were elucidated. On Rh1/CeO2(111), CO reacts with adsorbed O2 via Eley-Rideal mechanism; and the rate-determined step of CO oxidation cycle is CO reaction with the rest O atom of O2 with a barrier of 0.99 eV. On Rh1/CeO2-δ(111), CO reacts with activated O2 via Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism and continue the oxidation cycle via Rh1/CeO2(111). On RhxCe1-xO2, CO directly reacts with surface oxygen without barrier to form RhxCe1-xO2-δ; while the barrier of CO oxidation cycle on RhxCe1-xO2-δ is 1.18 eV. Upon the discrimination of the catalytic roles of Rh1/CeO2 catalysts with different structures, several important insights into design and development of Rh1/CeO2 catalysts with high oxidation performance were proposed. Graphical abstract Rh single atom supported on CeO2 with different structures is theoretically explored. The calculated results showed that CO oxidation on Rh1/CeO2(111) has the lowest barrier via ER mechanism; CO oxidation on Rh1/CeO2-δ(111) via LH mechanism; CO directly reacts with surface oxygen without barrier on RhxCe1-xO2 but the barrier of CO oxidation cycle on RhxCe1-xO2-δ is 1.18 eV.

The noble metal atomically disperses on support to provide a uniform active site and achieve the maximum atomic efficiency. It immediately becomes a research hotspot and has attracted extensive attention [2–6], which has been widely applied into CO oxidation [7–12], water gas shift reaction [13–16], selective hydrogenation and oxidation [17–21], etc. Since the interaction between single-atom metal and support of SAC catalysts is quite different from the interaction of the traditional metal nanoparticles with support known as strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), SACs exhibited significantly different properties compared with NP/support catalysts [22–26]. For example, it is usually believed that Rh-based catalysts show relatively low activity in CO oxidation compared with Au, Pt and Pd nanoparticle catalysts [27–29]. However, it was surprised to find that Rh-based catalysts also show excellent performance when Rh reduced to sub-nanoclusters or even single atom on support [30,31]. For example, Rh sub-nanoclusters supported on TiO2 are very active towards CO oxidation at low temperatures [32]. Qiao et al. [33] reported that Rh1/ZnO shows very distinguished CO oxidation activity and is higher than those of Pt1/ZnO and Au1/ZnO. In addition, Rh1/CeO2 show high CO activity at low-temperature [34,35], high activity of CO2 hydrogenation and high selectivity of formate compared with the Rh nanoparticles on ceria [36], full NO conversion with a TOF of about 330 h− 1 [37], as well as the high activity and high regioselectivity of olefin isomerization-hydrosilylation. Therefore, Rh1/CeO2 is a very important potential catalyst in oxidative and hydrogenation reactions. Despite of the important application of Rh1/CeO2 catalysts, the quantitative structure-activity relationship between Rh1/CeO2 and reactions still remains unknown due to the structures of Rh1/CeO2 varied with the preparation methods. For example, Rh single atom might disperse at CeO2 surface with and without oxygen vacancy; or Rh atom might dope into ceria to substitute Ce atom to form doped-ceria solid solution. The different Rh1/CeO2 single-atom catalysts lead to the different catalytic performance. However, due to the limitation of preparation methods, it is hard to prepare the modeling catalyst with a single-type and uniform Rh1/CeO2 catalyst. The practical catalysts generally have the four structures, corresponding to the statistic results of the total contribution derived from Rh1/CeO2 with different structures. Therefore, it remains a substantial challenge to unravel the different catalytic roles of different Rh1/CeO2 catalyst catalysts. To solve this difficult problem, four modeling catalysts with different structures of Rh1/CeO2 catalyst were systematically calculated by density functional theory (DFT) method. Their catalytic active sites and reaction mechanism were discovered by calculating the electronic properties, as well as CO and O2 adsorption and reaction behaviors on modeling catalysts. The present work sheds light into the deconvolution of the catalytic role in practical catalysis, which provides important information for the rational design and development of catalysts with high performance. 2 Method and models Density functional theory calculations were performed using Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code [38–40]. The Perdew-Wang 1991 (PW91) functional was adopted to treat the electron exchange and correlation effects by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [41]. The projector augmented plane wave (PAW) method with a frozen-core approximation was used to describe electron-ion interaction [42]. The valence electrons of Rh, Ce, O and C atoms are 4d85s1, 5s25p64f15d16s2, 2s22p4 and 2s22p2, respectively. The Monkhorst-Pack (MP) method was applied into the integrations of Brillouin-zone [43]. Gaussian smearing method was used with a value of 0.1 eV in this work. The cutoff energy was set as 400 eV for the plane wave basis set based on the convergence tests [44]. The Kohn-Sham equations were solved self-consistently. The energy tolerance was set to 1.0 × 10−5 eV; the maximum Hellmann Feynman force tolerance was set to 0.03 eV/Å for the geometrical optimization. The DFT+U (U=5 eV) approach was adopted herein to correct the on-site Coulombic and exchange interactions of the strongly localized f electron [45–49]. The lattice constant of CeO2 optimized in this work is 5.487 Å, which is in good agreement with the experimental value (5.411 Å) [40,45]. A six-layer p ( 2 3 × 3 ) CeO2(111) slab with the three bottom Ce-O atoms fixed was adopted herein [50]. Rh single atom might disperse at the CeO2 surface with and without oxygen vacancy; or Rh atom might dope into ceria to substitute Ce atom to form doped-ceria solid solution. The vacuum spaces were all set as 15 Å along the z axis to minimize the interactions between vertical slabs. The corresponding structures were shown in Fig. 1 . The adsorption energy of O2 and CO on Rh/CeO2 is defined as follows: E ads= E( adsorbate/slab) – (E slab +E adsorbate), where E (adsorbate /slab), E slab and E adsorbate are the energies of the system, slab and adsorbate, respectively [51]. The negative adsorption energy means an exothermic adsorption; while the more negative of adsorption energy represents the stronger interaction between adsorbate and modeling catalyst. The transition states were calculated by a global pathway searching technique by Large-scale Atomic Simulation with neural network Potential (LASP) package based on the stochastic surface walking method [52]. The activation energies were calculated on the basis of the energy difference between the initial and transition states. Frequency analysis was performed to verify no imaginary frequency and only one imaginary frequency for the stable and TS structures, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Geometric and electronic structures of Rh1/CeO2 As shown in Fig. 1, the adsorption energy of Rh at the OO bridge site of CeO2(111) is −3.10 eV with the Rh-O bonds of 2.067 and 2.071 Å, respectively; while the adsorption energy of Rh at CeO2-δ(111) with an oxygen vacancy is −2.69 eV with three Rh-Ce bonds of 2.706∼2.794 Å. To investigate the electronic interactions between Rh modified CeO2(111), the charged density differences (CDD) of typical configurations were calculated as the follow definition: Δρ=ρRh/substrate-ρsubstrate-ρRh, where ρRh/substrate is the charge density of the system; ρsubstrate and ρRh are the charge densities of the non-interacting Rh and substrate, respectively. Therefore, CDDs measure the charge redistribution upon Rh adsorption. Yellow and blue colors in CDD indicate the gain and loss of electrons. CDD indicates that Rh loses electrons on CeO2(111) to form a Ce3+ ion and gains electrons to form two Rh-O bonds, which is well consistent with the reported result [53]; while Rh gains electron on CeO2-δ(111) to form three Rh-Ce bonds, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). If Rh doped into the stoichiometric CeO2, Rh loses electrons to form a Rh3+ ion with six Rh-O bonds of 2.137∼2.151 Å; while if it doped into CeO2 with oxygen vacancy, Rh3+ and Ce3+ coexist on RhxCe1-xO2-δ with five Rh-O bonds of 2.167∼2.718 Å, as shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d). 3.2 O2 adsorption on Rh1/CeO2 As shown in Fig. 2 (a), the adsorption energy is −2.05 eV when O2 lies at Rh atom of Rh1/CeO2(111) with the Rh-O bond of 1.971 and 2.029 Å, respectively. Fig. 2(b) shows that O2 locates at the interface of Rh and CeO2, its adsorption energy is −1.81 eV with the Rh-O and Ce-O bonds of 1.883 and 2.496 Å, respectively. When O2 stands at the top site of Rh atom, only one Rh-O bond forms with the Rh-O bond length of 1.835 Å and the adsorption energy of −1.61 eV, as shown in Fig. 2(c). Charge density differences indicate that the d orbital of Rh loses electrons and the 2π* orbital of O2 gains electrons. The OO bonds in Fig. 2(a)∼(c) are elongated to 1.356, 1.354 and 1.291 Å due to the different interactions with Rh atom on Rh1/CeO2, respectively. When an oxygen vacancy exists on CeO2(111) surface, two Ce3+ ions form and their electrons feed back to Rh atom, leading to the stronger interactions between O2 and Rh1/CeO2-δ(111). This is verified by O2 adsorption on Rh1/CeO2-δ(111), that is, O2 lies at Rh top site or the interface between Rh and CeO2-δ(111) with the adsorption energies of −2.78 and −2.19 eV, respectively, which are stronger than those on the stoichiometric surface by 0.73 and 0.38 eV, as shown in Fig. 2(d) and (e). When Rh doped into ceria, one oxygen vacancy forms and O2 fills into the vacancy to form a peroxide species at the interface between Rh and CeO2-δ(111) to form two Ce-O bonds with the bond length of 2.575 and 2.653 Å, as well as one Rh-O bond of 2.202 Å. The adsorption energy is −2.11 eV, as shown in Fig. 2(f). The OO bonds in Fig. 2(d)∼(f) are elongated to 1.352, 1.337 and 1.412 Å, respectively. 3.3 CO adsorption on Rh1/CeO2 It was reported that CO only physically adsorbs at the stoichiometric CeO2(111) surface. However, strong adsorption occurs when O2 adsorbs at Rh/CeO2. As shown in Fig. 3 , CO binds to Rh and surface O to form a bidentate carbonate with the CO (1.288 Å) and Rh-C (1.889 Å) bonds, respectively; or CO locates at the top site of Rh with a Rh-C (1.850 Å) bond. The corresponding adsorption energies are −2.92 and −2.72 eV, respectively, which is much stronger than those on clean CeO2(111) [54,55]. When CO stands at Rh atom of Rh1/CeO2-δ(111), its adsorption energy is up to −3.39 eV, which is stronger than that on Rh1/CeO2(111) by 0.47 eV, as shown in Fig. 3(c). This is also due to more electrons derived from Ce3+ ion to the 2π* orbital of CO, which enhances the interaction between CO and Rh1/CeO2-δ(111). However, when CO adsorbs at the interface of Rh and CeO2-δ(111) to form a bidentate carbonate, its adsorption energy decreases to −2.37 eV with the CO (1.344 Å) and Rh-C (1.990 Å) bonds. This is due to the long distance of C-Rh bond, leading to the relatively lower adsorption energy than that on Rh1/CeO2(111) by 0.55 eV. To investigate the effects of Rh-doped ceria on CO adsorption, CO adsorption on RhxCe1-xO2 with and without oxygen vacancy was systematically calculated. As shown in Fig. 4 (a), CO reacts with the surface oxygen to form CO2 and release −2.18 eV. If CO adsorbs at the top site of Rh atom, its adsorption energy is −1.33 eV with a Rh-C bond of 1.889 Å. If oxygen vacancy forms on RhxCe1-xO2, CO might react with the surface oxygen to form CO2 and release −3.28 eV, which is much stronger than that on RhxCe1-xO2. This is also due to more electrons derived from oxygen vacancy on RhxCe1-xO2-δ. Similar result was also observed on CO adsorbed at Rh top site of RhxCe1-xO2-δ with stronger adsorption energy (−1.71 eV) and shorter Rh-C bond length (1.852 Å). 3.4 CO oxidation on Rh1/CeO2 According to the adsorption behaviors of O2 and CO on Rh1/CeO2 catalysts, CO oxidation based on Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal mechanisms was systematically calculated and shown in Fig. 5–7 . 3.4.1 CO oxidation on Rh1/CeO2(111) As shown in Fig. 5, O2 prefer to adsorb at the top site of Rh on Rh1/CeO2(111) with an adsorption energy of −2.05 eV to form a superoxide species. For Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, CO co-adsorbs at the top site of Rh to release −1.79 eV, and then reacts with the neighbor superoxide to form CO2 via overcoming a barrier of 1.33 eV. For Eley-Rideal mechanism, CO directly reacts with adsorbed O2 to form a bidentate carbonate to release −2.94 eV, and then overcomes a barrier of 0.52 eV to form CO2. Both pathways left one surface O atom at the interface between Rh and ceria. CO might continue to react with the surface O atom and overcome a barrier of 0.99 eV to form CO2. Then Rh1/CeO2(111) recovers and continues the new oxidation cycle. 3.4.2 CO oxidation on Rh1/CeO2-δ(111) If an oxygen vacancy forms to form Rh1/CeO2-δ(111), O2 firstly fills into the vacancy to form activated oxygen species, as shown in Fig. 6. Then, CO co-adsorbs at the top site of Rh atom with an adsorption energy of −2.08 eV, then overcomes a low barrier of 0.27 eV to form CO2. Meanwhile, CO might also directly react with O2 to form a bidentate carbonate with an adsorption energy of −5.30 eV, and then desorb as CO2 by overcoming a barrier of 1.34 eV. The left O atom derived from adsorbed O2 molecule recovers the surface oxygen vacancy to form Rh1/CeO2(111), which CO and O2 might react as the reaction pathway shown in Fig. 5. If CO continues to react with the left O atom, it needs to overcome a relatively high barrier of 3.10 eV to form CO2 and produce a new oxygen vacancy, which might continue CO oxidation cycle shown in Fig. 6. 3.4.3 CO oxidation on RhxCe1-xO2-δ As shown in Fig. 7, when Rh doped into ceria, CO might directly react with surface oxygen atom to form CO2 with the reaction energy of −2.18 eV and produce an oxygen vacancy. Then O2 fills into the vacancy with an adsorption energy of −2.11 eV. CO might continue to react with the activated oxygen species to form a bidentate carbonate with reaction energy of −3.37 eV. Then it overcomes a barrier of 1.18 eV to form CO2 and recovers to the initial structure of RhxCe1-xO2, which is ready for the next oxidation cycle. 4 Discussion According to CO adsorption and reaction behaviors on the four modeling catalysts, we can systematically understand the catalytic roles of Rh1/CeO2 and CO oxidation pathway. It was reported that the stoichiometric ceria surface has relatively low CO oxidation activity due to the high barrier of CO reaction with surface oxygen atom [56]. When surface oxygen vacancy form on ceria, O2 might adsorb at the top of Ce to form surperoxide at low Ov concentration, which directly reacts with CO to form CO2; or O2 might fill into the vacancy to form peroxide at relatively high Ov concentration, which reacts with CO to form carbonate and desorb to CO2 [56]. Both cases recover the stoichiometric ceria surface, where CO needs to overcome a high barrier to react with surface oxygen atom to form CO2 and produce new oxygen vacancy. When a single Rh atom adsorbs at the stoichiometric CeO2(111), O2 can be directly activated on Rh1/CeO2(111) and react with CO via Eley-Rideal mechanism with a low barrier of 0.52 eV. Furthermore, the rate-determined step of CO oxidation cycle on Rh1/CeO2(111) is CO reaction with the rest O atom of O2 with a barrier of 0.99 eV, which is much lower than the barrier of CO reaction with surface oxygen of ceria. Then the modeling catalyst recovers its initial structure and continues the next oxidation cycle. Different from Rh1/CeO2(111), CO reacts with activated O2 Rh1/CeO2-δ(111) via Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism with a very low barrier of 0.27 eV; meanwhile the surface oxygen vacancy was recovered by the rest O atom of O2 to Rh1/CeO2(111). Then it might continue CO oxidation on Rh1/CeO2(111) rather than react with surface oxygen by overcoming a very high barrier of 3.10 eV. For CO oxidation on RhxCe1-xO2, it directly reacts with surface oxygen without barrier to form RhxCe1-xO2-δ; then O2 fills the vacancy and reacts with CO to form a bidentate carbonate. The rate-determined step of CO oxidation cycle is the desorption of carbonate to recover RhxCe1-xO2 with a barrier of 1.18 eV. According to the discussion above, the order of CO oxidation activity is RhxCe1-xO2, Rh1/CeO2-δ(111), Rh1/CeO2(111) and RhxCe1-xO2-δ in view of the oxidation barrier. However, the oxidation cycle cannot be sustained on RhxCe1-xO2 and Rh1/CeO2-δ(111) despite of their low barriers. They should undergo the RhxCe1-xO2-δ and Rh1/CeO2 to complete an oxidation cycle. The CO activity of Rh1/CeO2 is higher than that of RhxCe1-xO2-δ in view of the rate-determined step with a barrier of 0.99 and 1.18 eV, respectively. Therefore, to design and develop Rh1/CeO2 catalysts with high CO oxidation performance, it might prepare ceria with nanoparticle, which enhances the interactions between Rh atom and ceria; or introduce doped-metal to increase the stability of single-atom Rh on catalyst. These deductions were verified by the recently experimental results [35,36,57]. For RhxCe1-xO2-δ catalyst, it should uniformly disperse Rh atom into the surface of ceria nanoparticle, which enhances their catalytic efficiency. 5 Conclusion Based on the systematic investigation of the geometric and electronic structures of four modeling catalysts of Rh1/CeO2, as well as the adsorption and reaction of CO and O2, the catalytic role and CO oxidation mechanism on the four Rh1/CeO2 catalysts were elucidated. On Rh1/CeO2(111), CO reacts with adsorbed O2 via Eley-Rideal mechanism; and the rate-determined step of CO oxidation cycle on Rh1/CeO2(111) is CO reaction with the rest O atom with a barrier of 0.99 eV. On Rh1/CeO2-δ(111), CO reacts with activated O2 via Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism and continue the oxidation cycle via Rh1/CeO2(111). On RhxCe1-xO2, CO directly reacts with surface oxygen without barrier to form RhxCe1-xO2-δ; while the barrier of CO oxidation cycle on RhxCe1-xO2-δ is 1.18 eV. These results discriminate the catalytic roles of Rh1/CeO2 catalysts with different structures and shed important insight into developing the Rh single-atom catalysts with high oxidation performance.

        "dc:description": "Rh1/CeO2 attracts much attention in single-atom catalysis due to its unique catalytic performance and maximum atomic efficiency. Since different possible structures of Rh1/CeO2 coexist in real catalysts, it is hard to discriminate their catalytic roles and reaction mechanism due to the difficulty of preparing pure modeling catalyst. To solve this difficult problem, the adsorption and reaction behaviors of CO and O2 on four modeling catalysts of Rh1/CeO2 were systematically investigated by using density functional theory calculation in this work. The catalytic role and CO oxidation mechanism on Rh1/CeO2 catalysts were elucidated. On Rh1/CeO2(111), CO reacts with adsorbed O2 via Eley-Rideal mechanism; and the rate-determined step of CO oxidation cycle is CO reaction with the rest O atom of O2 with a barrier of 0.99 eV. On Rh1/CeO2-δ(111), CO reacts with activated O2 via Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism and continue the oxidation cycle via Rh1/CeO2(111). On RhxCe1-xO2, CO directly reacts with surface oxygen without barrier to form RhxCe1-xO2-δ; while the barrier of CO oxidation cycle on RhxCe1-xO2-δ is 1.18 eV. Upon the discrimination of the catalytic roles of Rh1/CeO2 catalysts with different structures, several important insights into design and development of Rh1/CeO2 catalysts with high oxidation performance were proposed.",
