Bertolini Eniricerche, 20097 S. Donato Milanese (Italy) Abstract Organometallic nickel complexes with bidentate P O chelating ligands of type Ph(PPh3)Ni(PhzPCHCOPh) were heterogenized according to a new strategy - through the =CH- group of the ylidic ligand - and their behaviour in the polymerization and/ or oligomerization of ethylene investigated. When anchored to polystyrene resins the catalytic systems showed a high and very selective activity in ethylene polymerization (1-2.5 kg of polymer (g Ni)-' h-') working in slurry or in gas-solid phase with reproduction of the morphology of the starting resins. When the matrix is a microspherical resin (0.1-0.3 mm diameter) the HDPE (high-density polyethylene) obtained is in the form of regular and very compact spheres of 3-7 mm diameter. Depending on the physical characteristics of the matrix (crosslinking, surface area, porosity, existence of spacing groups), compact spheres, hollow spheres (`eggs'), geminates, polymer powders, or liquid oligomers were obtained. Introduction P O and O O chelated nickel phosphine complexes are well-known catalysts for the oligomerization of ethylene to linear a-olefins [ 1 ]. When the coordination sphere of nickel is modified by addition of special ligands such as conjugated ylides or when a `scavenger' of the phosphine ligand is added, catalytic polymerization and copolymerization of ethylene to highmolecular-weight polymers is obtained [2, 3]. Attempts to heterogenize the homogeneous nickel catalysts by impregnation on inorganic carriers [4, 5] or by anchoring to polystyrene resins through the phenyl groups of triphenylphosphine ligands (I and II, representing the intermediate active species) were unsatisfactory, owing to the decrease in the activity and selectivity [4]. The aim of the present work was the development of a new heterogenization route for the nickel catalyst based on the anchoring of the complex through the carbon atom of the chelate ring in order to have a less sterically constrained and congested metal centre [6]. To achieve this purpose and to make the nickel unit progressively more exposed, the following strategies were followed: 0304-5102/92/$5.00 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia.

Functionalization of polystyrene matrices with alkenyl spacing groups. The ylidic ligand (triphenylphosphine-p-bromobenzoyl methylene) was prepared according to the procedure reported for the non-brominated ligand f71. The characteristics of the functionalized ST/DVB resins (Dow Chemical), with various crosslinking DVB contents, porosities and specific surface areas 424 (macroporous and gel resins), and of the functionalized linear polystyrenes, with various molecular weights, are reported in Table 1. Polymeric matrices (4 g) were lithiated according to the procedure of Grubbs and Shin-Chin [8] and then reacted with an excess of chelating ylidic ligand (2.3 g) at room temperature in THF as solvent for 48 h. The phosphinated polymer was filtered, and washed with THF and with methanol to remove LiBr. The extent of functionalization was, in the case of linear polystyrenes, in the range of 0.7-1.2 mmol of chelating group per g, corresponding to a P content of 2.2-3.5 wt.%, and in the case of crosslinked resins in the range of 0.01-0.2 mmol of chelating groups per g, corresponding to a P content of 0.03-0.6 wt.% (Table 1). To introduce a spacing alkenyl group, -(CHZ)n-, according to Scheme 2, the procedure reported here for n =10 was followed: 5 g of the lithiated matrix were reacted at room temperature for 48 h with 13.5 g of 1,10dibromodecane using 30 ml of THF as solvent, then filtered, and washed with THF and methanol. The functionalization of the matrix was 0.59 mmol of bromoalkenyl groups per g, with a Br content of 4.7 wt.%. The functionalized brominated matrix was then suspended in 120 ml of cyclohexane and reacted with 8 ml of t-BuLi, 1.7 M (13.6 mmol), at room temperature for 30 min, then filtered, washed with cyclohexane and reacted in THF solution with 1.5 g of ylidic ligand at room temperature for 24 h. The extent of functionalization was 0.03 mmol of chelating groups per g (Table 1).

The polymeric chelating matrix was then reacted with nickel precursor according to the procedure described for homogeneous complexes [ 1 ]. Catalytic batch experiments were performed in a 125 n-l stainless-steel rocking autoclave heated in an oil bath or in a 250 ml magnetically stirred glass reactor.

Molecular weights and molecular-weight distributions were determined on a Waters 150/C GPC equipped with GMHGHT columns. Results and discussion The pathways followed to prepare the functionalized matrices according to the options III A and B and IV A and B are depicted in Schemes 1 and 2, and the characteristics of the polymeric matrices are reported in Table 1. The study was initiated using a homogeneous catalytic system, model of the polystyrene anchored catalyst, i.e., the complex V obtained in situ by reacting Ni(COD)2 with PPh3 and the corresponding keto-ylide. The complex was active in the oligomerization of ethylene to linear oligomers with an activity (T.N.) and selectivity analogous to those reported for the typical P O bonded monomeric systems [ 1 ]. In an analogous run carried out under the same conditions with the nickel catalyst anchored to a ST/DVB functionalized resin (option III A), prepared in situ from Ni(COD)2, PPh3 and the matrix DC, a very rapid reaction took place, with formation of high-molecular-weight polyethylene as white compact and regular spheres of large diameter (2-7 mm) (replica of the morphology of the starting support), which occupied the entire volume of the reactor: no oligomers were produced (FIgs. 1 and 2). This unusual and surprising behaviour prompted us to investigate the reasons why the simple heterogenization operation of the nickel catalyst resulted in such a dramatic change in the activity and selectivity of the process. We observed the same polymerization reaction when the catalyst, prepared in advance, was separated from the mother liquor and accurately washed with a toluene solution of PPh3 and pure toluene to remove the unreacted Fig. 1. Polyethylene spheres. Fig. 2. Enlarged photo of a sphere of polyethylene. 427 Ni(COD)2 and avoid the possible scavenger function for the ligand in the catalytic steps [9]. Only a decrease in the rate of formation of the polymer was observed in this case. Moreover, the polymerization takes place also in the absence of the triphenylphosphine ligand and also working in the gas-solid phase without any solvent. Each microsphere of the heterogenized catalyst becomes a polymerization centre on which the polymer regularly grows in a replica of the initial morphology of the support: the number of macrospheres of polyethylene corresponds to the number of initial microspheres of the resin. If the supported catalyst (after preparation) is a powder, the polyethylene obtained is equally a powder (Table 2, run 3). After the formation of the intermediate phenyl-nickel derivative III (recognized by the orange-red colour that the polymer bed took on [41), analogously to what was observed in the oligomerization process [ 101, at a temperature of 50 C an induction period for the reaction is generally observed, necessary for the formation of the active nickel hydrido species from species III. The induction period can, however, be reduced or totally suppressed by raising the temperature to 70-80 C or by initially introducing hydrogen (0.5-0.7 MPa) together with ethylene. In this latter case the detection in solution of a stoichiometric amount of benzene indicates the formation of the active hydride by hydrogenation of the intermediate phenyl-nickel species (III). The physical nature of the functionalized resins strongly affects the activity of the anchored catalysts and the morphology of the polyethylene produced: the catalysts supported on macroporous resins with a large enough pore diameter (Table 2, runs 2, 3, 5, 6, 8) give very compact polyethylene spheres, the highest productivities being observed with the less rigid matrices with lower DVB crosslinking. On the other hand, the catalyst supported on the rigid resin with a high DVB crosslinking (63%), which can be functionalized only to a very low extent owing to its low swelling ability, shows a very low activity in spite of its large surface area and gives irregular aggregates of a solid polymer (Table 2, run 7; Fig. 3). The catalyst supported on the microporous gel resin is very active and, surprisingly, gives hollow spheres of polyethylene, small `eggs' of 2-5 mm diameter (Table 2, run 4; Fig. 4). The introduction of a spacing group of three carbon atoms between the ylidic ligand and the polystyrene rings (option IV A, n = 3) does not significantly modify the behaviour of the catalytic system (Table 2, run 9); polyethylene in spheres is once again the main product, but a small but significant amount of linear oligomer a-olefins is also produced. When the spacing group consists of ten carbon atoms the behaviour of the catalytic system completely changes, and liquid oligomers prevail on polyethylene (Table 2, run 10). In this case, however, the productivity of the catalyst is strongly reduced, probably related to the low degree of functionalization of the matrix. Using functionalized linear polystyrenes as matrices, polyethylene is practically the only product formed when the molecular weight of the support Fig. 3. Geminates of polyethylene. Fig. 4. Hollow spheres (`eggs') of polyethylene. is high (M.W. 250,000) (Table 2, run 11); however, it is accompanied by significant amounts of liquid oligomers when the molecular weight of the polystyrene is decreased (M.W. 45,000) (Table 2, run 12). Finally, when a long spacing group is introduced on a low-molecular-weight linear polystyrene (option IV B, n= 12), the supported catalyst gives mainly liquid oligomers, although with a low activity. Characteristics of the polyethyO The characterization of the polyethylene, obtained by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), IR, NMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC), is consistent with a high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The crystallinity of the polymer, evaluated from the XRD spectrum and from the density values (0.95-0.96 g ml-1), ranges from 75 to 85%. The Tm =136 C and Tc =117 C registered by DSC are typical for a HDPE. \"C and 1H NMR and IR spectra exclude the presence of branching ramifications and indicate the presence of methyl and vinyl terminal groups, according to the mechanism of an initial insertion of ethylene in the H-Ni bond followed by successive insertion in the R-CHZ-Ni bond and of termination of the chain by 3-elimination of H (11 ]. The weight-average molecular weights (M,) of the polymers are very high, and the high polydispersity indexes (MaM ) determined by GPC (Fig. 5) are practically independent of the reaction conditions (time, p(C2H4)), eventual presence of H2, type of macroporous catalyst supporting resin). The very broad distribution of the molecular weights, which does not vary when the isochronous runs are carried out at constant pressure, suggests the non-uniformity of the catalytic centres (in relation to their activity). In this respect it is worth noting the bimodal distribution curve of the molecular weights observed when a gel-type resin (Table 2, run 4) or a linear polystyrene (Table 2, run 12) are used as supports (Fig. 6). This behaviour seems to indicate the presence on the catalyst of different types of metal centres with very different activities and tendencies toward ss-elimination. 429 20 18 16 t 14 /./. \\ 12 d 10 / \\ L 8 / z 6 4 /. 2 ,% ./. / \\ 0 .: i. i 2 3 4 5 6 7 Log M w Fig. 5.

The activity in the polymerization instead of oligomerization cannot be ascribed to electronic factors - the increased conjugation by the insertion in the chelating group of a second phenyl ring (compare formulas I and II with III) - since the model low-molecular-weight homogeneous catalyst (V) is still active in the oligomerization. Nor can it be due to the possible `scavenger' effect of soluble nickel species for the triphenylphosphine ligand bound to the active catalyst, since special runs exclude this possibility. The determining factors seem to be the heterogenization of the catalyst, which discourages bimolecular reaction termination by interaction of two active centres, and the steric factors inherent in the polymeric nature of the chelate, which favour the propagation steps with respect to the ss-elimination of the hydride. When the resin is simultaneously rigid (high crosslinking) and macroporous (high surface area), the functionalization of the matrix is more extended (Fig. 7(A)) and the catalytic spherical `germ' (around which the polyethylene grows regularly in spheres) is more active. When the resin is gel-like and the polymer coil is not too rigid, the matrix can easily be swollen by the solvent (Fig. 7(B)) and the polyethylene may grow inside and outside the initial microsphere, resulting in the formation of polyethylene `eggs'. When the resin is rigid (high crosslinking) and microporous (low surface area), the distribution of the anchored nickel is probably not uniform on x x X Jr + + (q X X It- V& ~t ' X- x + It -I. + %.*, X IL WX 'L x A) Highly cross-linked B) Gellular resin C) Linear polystyrene with spacing macroporous resin groups Fig. 7.

The introduction of spacing groups in the resin, and especially in the linear polystyrenes, actually loosens the steric constraint of the polymer matrix, making the metal unit more mobile and available for the ligand, and then becoming active for the oligomerization, as occurs with the homogeneous systems (Fig. 7(C)).

Bertolini Eniricerche, 20097 S. Donato Milanese Italy Organometallic nickel complexes with bidentate P O ⌢ chelating ligands of type Ph(PPh3)Ni(Ph2PCHCOPh) were heterogenized according to a new strategy — through the =CH— group of the ylidic ligand — and their behaviour in the polymerization and/or oligomerization of ethylene investigated. When anchored to polystyrene resins the catalytic systems showed a high and very selective activity in ethylene polymerization (1–2.5 kg of polymer (g Ni)−1 h−1) working in slurry or in gas—solid phase with reproduction of the morphology of the starting resins. When the matrix is a microspherical resin (0.1–0.3 mm diameter) the HDPE (high-density polyethylene) obtained is in the form of regular and very compact spheres of 3–7 mm diameter. Depending on the physical characteristics of the matrix (crosslinking, surface area, porosity, existence of spacing groups), compact spheres, hollow spheres (‘eggs’), geminates, polymer powders, or liquid oligomers were obtained.
