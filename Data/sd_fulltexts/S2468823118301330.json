Graphical abstract To mimic biological enzyme in catalysis, metal-imidazole-salen complexes were proposed (via DFT calculation) and synthesized in situ within the cavities of Y zeolite. Among the synthesized zeozymes, the Cu-salenIIY exhibited a prominent catalytic efficiency for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Specifically, the activity and selectivity of the encapsulated catalyst were comparable to those of the free Cu-salenII complex in solution. Furthermore, the high activity and selectivity were preserved during the repeated cycles. The similarity in the initial activity implies that the Cu-salenII complex just resides in the cavity of the zeolite Y, and its intrinsic properties responsible for the catalytic activity keep intact after encapsulation. The confinement of zeolite nanocavities effectively inhibited the dimerization or aggregation of the Cu-salenII complex and prevented the active species from escaping into reaction solution, thus resulting in a remarkably improved in the catalytic reusability and durability. Keywords Benzyl alcohol Selective oxidation Y zeolite Encapsulation Metal-salen complex 1 Introduction The design and development of environmentally benign catalytic process is of perennial importance. Transition metal complexes have attracted enormous attention over the past few decades [1–3], due to their unique structural, physio-chemical properties and catalytic behaviors under mild reaction conditions. Of particular interest is metal-salen complex having unsaturated coordination sites in the axial direction, which has been employed as dioxygen activating catalysts mimicking catalase and superoxide dismutase [4–6]. However, the neat metal-salen complexes suffer from the inherent disadvantages associated with homogeneous catalysts and are prone to deactivation due to the occurrence of molecular dimerization in solution. These drawbacks hinder the large-scale industrial application despite of the high activity of metal-salen complexes [7–11]. To overcome the limitation, immobilization of the metal-salen complexes on a non-toxic and recyclable support is essential. Inspired by the structure of enzyme, worldwide efforts have been made to encapsulate the metal complexes into porous materials [12–15], mimicking the characteristics of enzyme. Y zeolites have been considered as one of the most promising host matrices for encapsulation of Metal-salen complexes since the channels and cages in Y zeolites are similar to those created by the protein structure of natural enzyme [16–18]. In recent years, a series of zeolite Y-encapsulated metal-salen complexes have been successfully synthesized and employed as catalysts for many reactions [19–23]. In most cases, these encapsulated complexes with an enzyme-like structure showed intriguing catalytic behavior that can hardly be achieved by homogeneous system or conventional heterogeneous system, which motivates the development of zeozyme catalysts and catalytic innovation [24–26]. Intensive research in the area continues in two aspects: 1) the rational design and fabrication of transition metal complexes having suitable geometry and electronic properties via tailoring ligands [27–29], and 2) the development and optimization of encapsulation technologies [30,31]. As an effort in exploring the catalytic applications of zeozymes, metal-imidazole-salen complexes were designed by the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The complexes were synthesized and encapsulated in zeolite cages by a flexible ligand method, followed by the catalytic evaluation in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The influence of the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of immobilized active metal complexes on their catalytic behaviors were also discussed. The goal of this work is to develop a novel enzyme-like catalyst with high activity, selectivity and recyclability. 2 Experiments 2.1 Density functional theory calculation The geometry optimization was carried out using density functional theory (DFT) calculation with the B3LYP functional [32–35], as implemented in the Gaussian 09 suite of programs [36,37]. The effective core potentials (ECPs) of Hay and Wadt with a double-ζ valence basis set (LanL2DZ) were used in describing Cu and Zn [38–40], whereas the 6-31G* basis set was used for all other atoms. The electron distribution and transfer mechanism are determined using the Mulliken method [41] The spin of Cu-salen is double duo to single electron of d orbital of Cu2+, while the spin of Zn-salen was single, because of the full-filled d orbital of Zn2+. 2.2 Materials NaY zeolite (Si/Al = 2.4, 200 mesh) was purchased form Nankai University (Tianjin, China), 1H-imidazole-4-carbaldehyde (98%) from Maya Reagent Co. 1,2-Diaminocyclohexane (98%) and o-phenylenediamine (98%) were supplied by Aladdin Reagent Co. Benzyl alcohol (99%), hydrogen peroxide (30%), Cu(NO3)3·3H2O (99%) and Zn(CH3COO)2 (99%) were obtained from Adamas Reagent Co. All the chemicals were used without further treatment. 2.3 Characterization IR spectra were recorded using a Thermo Nicolet Magna IR 750 Spectrometer with a 4 cm−1 resolution in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 after the samples were mixed with KBr and pressed into tablets. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) in the 2θ angles range between 4°∼40° (step size: 0.02°, step time: 1 s). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 system at liquid N2 temperature. Before measurement, the samples were outgassed at 130 °C for 6 h. BET specific surface areas were calculated using the Barrett–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Metal content was measured on a Shimazu ICPE-9000 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) after the sample was treated by concentrated hydrofluoric acid. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were obtained on a Shimazu TGA-50H analyzer in N2 atmosphere in the temperature range of 353–973 K with a heating rate of 10 K min−1. The TGA curves were normalized by gravimetric method. Elemental analysis of C, H and N was performed with a Perkin-Elmer 2400 apparatus. UV–vis spectra were recorded on a Lambda 950 spectrophotometer. The UV–vis spectra of zeolite-based samples were recorded in diffuse reflectance mode (DR). 2.4 Synthesis of metal-salen complexes Metal-imidazole-salen complexes were prepared by one pot method according to previous report [42]. In a typical procedure, 6 mmol 1,2-diaminocyclohexane or o-phenylenediamine in MeOH (30 mL) was dropwise added to a solution of 12 mmol 1H-imidazole-4-carbaldehyde in MeOH (30 mL), and the mixture was refluxed for 7 h to form a light-brown solution. Subsequently, 6 mmol metal salt (Cu(NO3)3·3H2O or Zn(CH3COO)2) dissolved in MeOH (20 mL) was added into the ligand solution with stirring, and then reacted at 60 °C under N2 atmosphere for another 7 h. The resulting dark powders was collected by filtration, washed with MeOH and dried in a vacuums oven at 60 °C for 12 h. 2.5 Zeolite Y encapsulated complexes NaY zeolite (7.5 g, 200 mesh) was ion-exchanged in an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)3·3H2O or Zn(CH3COO)2 (250 mL, 0.02 mol/L) at 95 °C for 24 h. The slurry was filtered, washed thoroughly with deionized water and dried in vacuum at 60 °C to obtain MY zeolites (M = Cu, Zn). The resulting MY (2.5 g) was added to a mixture of 1H-imidazole-4-carbaldehyde (3.0 mmol) and 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (or o-phenylenediamine) (1.5 mmol) in MeOH (80 mL), and reacted for 12 h at 60 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. To remove the excess ligand and surface species, the resultant zeolite was extracted with anhydrous methanol in a Soxhlet-extractor till the extractant became colorless. The extracted zeolite was back exchanged in NaCl solution (0.1 mol·L−1, 300 mL) for 24 h in order to remove uncoordinated metal-ions in the zeolite. The zeolite sample was collected by filtration, washed with ethanol to remove Cl− (no AgCl precipitate was observed when adding AgNO3 to the filtrate), and dried at 105 °C in a vacuums oven. The zeolite-Y encapsulated metal-salen was denoted as M-salenY. The chemical structures and synthetic routes of metal-salen-containing samples were illustrated in Scheme 1 . 2.6 Catalyst test The catalytic reactions were conducted in a round-bottom flask. 10 mL of benzyl alcohol and 0.10 g of catalyst were dispersed in toluene (30 mL), and hydrogen peroxide (15 mL, 30%) was dropwise added into the reaction vessel with stirring. The mixture was heated to a defined reaction temperature using an oil bath. The specific conditions of each test were listed in a table along with the results for each reaction. At described time, sample was taken from the reaction vessel and analyzed by gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with capillary column (HP-5, 19091J-413) and a FID detector. For the recycling experiments, the used catalyst after each run was recovered by centrifugation and washed repeatedly with ethanol, and then reused in sequential runs under the same conditions. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 DFT calculation The optimized geometric structures and the electron localization function (ELF) isosurfaces of coordination compounds were displayed in Figs. 1 and 2 , respectively. Partial DFT calculation data and corresponding catalytic activities were summarized in Table 1 . The net charges of central metal ions are 1.000 ± 0.015 e for Cu and 1.415 ± 0.090 e for Zn instead of +2 (Table 1), which illustrates the partial electron transfer from the coordinated N atoms to central metal in M-salen (M = Cu, Zn) via the d-p orbital interaction. The coordination bonding is inferred from the extension direction and delocalization of N electron cloud (Fig. 2). From Fig. 1, M-salenII exhibits a planar quadrilateral structure at the equilibrium geometry, while M-salenI adopts slightly bent conformation. The geometric features of the metal-salen complexes are also supported by the relevant bond lengths and dihedral angles (Table S2). In general, the metal complex with a square planar geometry allow reactive molecule to access and coordinate to the central metal ion easily owing to smaller steric hindrance in the axial direction. At the same time, in the view of electron energy level, the lower oxidation state of central metal would be beneficial for the d-orbital electron transfer to the anti-bonding π* orbital of coordinated species and the activation of the reaction substrates. To mimic the function of enzymes in catalysis, in situ synthesis of these metal salen complexes within super-cages of Y zeolite is essential. For Y zeolite, the α-cage has a diameter of around 1.3 nm and cage mouth opening of about 0.7–0.8 nm. From the dimensional data in Table 1 and Fig. S2, the selected building units with a small dimension and/or flexible ligand have ability to access to the α-cages through the restricting windows, and where they react with previously exchanged transition metal ions to form complex. The complex adopts a square planar configuration, which is unable to escape from the zeolite cages. 3.2 Characterization of synthesized samples 3.2.1 FT-IR and UV-vis Fig. 3 shows the FT-IR spectra of salen, MY, M-salen and M-salenY samples. In the case of salenI (see Fig. 3a), the band in the region 2800–3000 cm−1 is due to the vibration of CH in cyclohexane [43]. The absorption band in the range of 600–1460 cm−1 corresponds to the vibration of the imidazole skeleton [44]. The absorption peak at 1648 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of CN group. In the spectra of the M-salenI complexes, the band due to CN appears at 1636 cm−1 for Cu-salenI and at 1641 cm−1 for ZnsalenI. The shifting of this band towards lower frequency in M-salenI complex indicates the coordination of M through CN functional group [45,46]. In addition, the band at around 440 cm−1 is due to the characteristic deformation of coordination bond (M-N), which can be as evidence for the formation of the metal-salen complexes [45]. The characteristic of Cu-N coordination bond is more apparent than that of Zn-N, which may be due to the weak coordination between Zn and salen. For the salenII (see Fig. 3b), the band at 3000 ∼ 3100 cm−1 is attributed to the CH stretching vibration in benzene. The band at 1664 cm−1 assignable to CN group in the salenII shifts to lower frequency (1628 ∼ 1598 cm−1) in the spectra of the M-salenII complexes, indicting the coordination of copper/zinc through CN group. Although many IR bands of M-salen complexes were masked by the strong absorption of Y zeolite, the characteristic bands in the 2850–3100 cm−1 and 1380–1450 cm−1 regions belonging to the neat complexes, could be still identified for all encapsulated complexes. Additionally, the similarity of IR spectra for all zeolite-based samples reveals that the zeolite framework remained unchanged during the encapsulation process [47]. The UV–vis spectra of NaY, MY, M-salen complexes and encapsulated M-salen complexes are shown in Fig. 4 . The electronic spectra of zeolite-based samples were recorded using a diffuse reflectance mode (DR). All zeolite samples (NaY, MY) exhibits strong zeolitic UV–vis absorption at 220 nm (Fig. 4a and c). On the Cu-based samples, a broad absorption band at 660 nm due to the d–d electron transition was also observed [46]. The electronic spectrum of salenI ligand shows two bands at 250 nm and 320 nm attributable to π→π* and n → π* transition [48]. SalenII ligand represents a broadening absorption band in the region 210–330 nm and weaker absorption at 350 nm (Fig. 4b and d). Compared with the salen ligands, all M-salen complexes show UV–vis absorption in the wavelength range of 350 ∼ 500 nm while maintaining the ligand's absorption band in the low wavelength range 250–340 nm. The appearance of the absorption band at 350–500 nm attributable to ligand-metal charge transfer (LMCT) is generally considered as evidence of the formation of coordination compounds [30,49]. On the encapsulated complex catalyst, the characteristic absorption of the corresponding complex can still be identified despite the small amount of the encapsulated complex, indicating that complex does exist in zeolite Y. In addition, the void topological structure of the zeolite Y is expected to have a distorting effect on the geometric structure of the encapsulated complex and bring about some changes in the inherent properties of the complex such as electronic and magnetic properties, which can be reflected in the electronic spectrum of the encapsulated complex. As shown in Fig. 4, a shifting of the characteristic absorption bands for the complex to higher or lower wavelengths was observed upon encapsulation, resulting from either the influence of zeolite Y matrix or the distortion in the geometry of metal complex itself. 3.2.2 XRD The XRD patterns of MY and M-salenY samples are given in Fig. 5 . The variation of the relative diffraction intensity I (220)/I (311) implies the occurrence of the M-ions rearrangement in the zeolite during the encapsulation process [50]. In addition, the similarity in the XRD patterns of both the parent zeolite and its encapsulated complexes, though the intensity of the characteristic peaks changed slightly, indicates that the zeolite framework remained intact after encapsulation, which is consistent with the FT-IR analysis. 3.2.3 Nitrogen adsorption–desorption and elemental analysis The specific surface areas (SBET ) and pore volumes (Vp ) of NaY and zeolite encapsulated complexes (M-salenY) were determined by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms technique. The data in Table 2 revealed that the SBET and Vp of M-salenY samples were significantly lower than that of the pristine zeolite Y, indicating that the pores of the encapsulated zeolites were partially filled with M-salen complexes. Specifically, the unit cell may be represented by Na56(AlO2)56(SiO2)136·nH2O as calculated from the constituents of NaY. The ratio of M/ligand is about 1 in the neat M-salen complexes (calculated from the elemental analysis data of C/H/N/M in Table S3). The metal content in CuY is 1.13% and that in Cu-salenIIY is 0.31%. About 27.4% of the metal initially present in the metal exchanged zeolite (CuY) was found to remain in the zeolite after complexation, and the rest was removed during the final back ion-exchange with NaCl solution. Since only α-super cage is capable of encapsulating metal-salen complexes and a unit cell contains one α-super cage, the percentages of occupied α-super cage in MY zeolite were estimated to be 89.7% for Cu-salenIIY and 84.4% for Zn-salenIIY, respectively. 3.2.4 TGA The thermogravimetric analysis of M-salenII and encapsulated M-salenIIY samples were depicted in Fig. 6 . Prior to TGA measurement, the sample was first purged with N2 at 80 °C for 10 min and then programmed temperature ramp (10 K/min). Owing to hydrophobic nature of the metal-salen compounds, only slight weight loss was observed in low temperature region on the neat complexes, whereas the zeolite-based materials showed significant weight loss in the temperature range of 80–150 °C due to water evaporation. A dramatic weight loss aroused from the decomposition of metal-salen compounds at 206 °C was observed for the M-salenII complexes, while it was gentle for the zeolite encapsulated complexes (M-salenIIY). Moreover, the similar decomposition temperature of the M-salenII and M-salenIIY samples again confirmed the successful encapsulation of the complex. 3.3 Catalytic evaluation The catalytic performance of MY, M-salenII and encapsulated M-salenIIY samples for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol was given in Fig. 7 . The catalytic activity of all the catalysts reached approximately maximum after running for 4 h at 60 °C. The maximum conversion of benzyl alcohol depends only on the catalyst itself under the well-defined reaction conditions. For this reason, the maximum conversion was employed as a criterion for evaluating the activity of the catalysts. In this work, a comparative study of the catalytic behaviors between neat and encapsulated complex was performed using slightly excessive catalysts. The activity of catalysts followed the sequence: Cu-salenII > Cu-salenI > Zn-salenII > Zn-salenI. The catalytic activity of the salenII complexes was superior to the salenI ones with the same central metal ion. For the same ligand, Cu-salen complexes were more active than Zn-salen. These results indicate that the intrinsic properties of M-salen complexes, such as their electronic configuration and geometry, play a key role in determining their catalytic activity. In the case of this reaction system, the electronic configuration of the central ion of the complexes has a more prominent effect on their catalytic properties. In addition, the oxidation mechanism may be different for copper(II) and zinc(II) complexes, Zn(II) salen I/II catalysts containing a red-ox inactive central ion. Consequently, Cu-salenII, having lower oxidation state and a planar tetragonal structure, exhibited the best benzyl alcohol oxidation activity. Of particular interests is that, under the same amount (100 mg), the maximum conversion of benzyl alcohol on the encapsulated CusalenIIY (containing only 1.68% complex) was comparable to that on the neat CusallenII, indicating that remarkably improved catalytic performance of the complex was achieved on encapsulation. This feature with improved catalytic activity also reveals that CusalenII encapsulated in zeolites existed as monomeric molecule, whereas the complex in solution maybe present as monomers, dimers and other forms. To further understand the effect of zeolite on catalyst properties, the kinetic plots of the neat and encapsulated Cu-salenII catalysts were given in Fig. 8 . The kinetic curves of benzyl alcohol oxidation for free and encapsulated CusalenII catalysts are very similar, suggesting that the diffusion of substrate or product in zeolites did not hinder the oxidation reaction. It is well-known that the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to formaldehyde is a slow reaction involving the activation and conversion of small molecules, which takes 4 h to reach the equilibrium of the reaction. The rate-determining step of the reaction should be in the intrinsic kinetic region of catalytic reaction, and the microporous diffusion resistance has little effect on reaction rate. Thus, the kinetic plot of benzyl alcohol oxidation observed on the encapsulated complex is analogue with that on the neat complex. The durability of zeolite-Y encapsulated catalyst (Cu-salenIIY) was performed in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. As shown in Fig. 9 , Cu-salenIIY catalyst represented good reusability and stability during the cycling process. The encapsulated catalyst could maintain its high activity and selectivity after six cycles without obvious deterioration. In contrast, the Cu-salenII complex could not be recycled in the present experiment because of difficulty in separation. The remarkable improvement in catalytic stability is mainly attributed to the following two factors: 1) Cu-salenII confined within Y-zeolite cavities hardly escapes into the reaction solution, resembling ‘ship in a bottle’ and minimizing the loss of the active complex. 2) The small size of Y-type zeolite supercages allows each cage to accommodate only one Cu-salenII molecule with quasi-planar tetragonal structure. Therefore, the complex molecules were isolated from each other and the dimerization or polymerization of the complex molecules was effectively inhibited, achieving the high catalytic stability. Compared with the other immobilized catalysts [51–56], the prepared CusalenIIY exhibted high catalytic efficiency and good recyclability. After recycling six times, the yield of benzaldehyde decreased by less than 10.9% on the CusalenIIY catalyst (see Table S4). 4 Conclusions To mimic the structure and function of enzyme, metal-imidazole-salen complexes were proposed (via DFT calculation) and synthesized in situ within the cavities of Y zeolite. Zeolite-encapsulated CusalenII exhibited desirable catalytic efficiency for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Specifically, the activity and selectivity of the zeozyme were comparable to those of the free Cu-salenII complex in solution. Furthermore, the high activity and selectivity were generally preserved during the repeated cycles. Namely, the obtained zeozyme possesses simultaneously the high activity associated with homogeneous catalysts and easy recyclability adherent to heterogeneous catalysts. This work contributes positively to the rational design and development of the zeozymes as well as the heterogenization of homogeneous catalyst which may be applied to other oxidation reactions.
