Graphical abstract An uncalcined HT supported Pd-NP catalyst was synthesized via co-precipitation, i.e., PdHT_100RED_20, and benchmarked against a Pd impregnated HT catalyst, i.e., Pd@HT_500RED_20. TEM analysis pointed out that the largest NPs (6.5 nm) were found in the co-precipitated catalyst because of its weaker steric NP confinement, compared to the benchmark catalyst (3.2 nm). The PdHT_100RED_20 had a significantly higher catalytic performance (60% conversion, 1.85% leaching) than Pd@HT_500RED_20 (19%, 0.98%) due to lack of calcination resulting in an ordered, and thus, more accessible HT structure in combination with its high support basicity. Both catalysts showed low Pd leaching confirming the suitability of HTs as NP support. Focusing on PdHT_100, the effect of the reduction temperature on the NP size and catalytic performance was investigated. NP size distribution analysis showed that the smallest NPs were found in PdHT_100RED_0 (5.3 nm), resulting in a higher catalytic performance (67%, 2.28%) when compared to PdHT_100RED_20 (6.5 nm). Performing the reduction at higher temperatures, i.e., at 60 °C (5.7 nm), caused an extremely low catalytic performance (13%, 0.20%) due to the less efficient reduction reaction with NaBH4 at higher reduction temperatures. Reusing PdHT_100RED_20, a decrease in catalytic performance (45%) was observed. However, this decrease was less pronounced (50%) when a re-activation of the catalyst with Na2CO3 between consecutive runs was performed. Moreover, it was shown that the leached Pd species were able to re-deposit onto the support if high conversions were obtained, and thus, an almost quantitatively recovery from the reaction mixture can be achieved with retention of its catalytic activity (>99%). Keywords Hydrotalcites Palladium nanoparticles ‘in-situ’ preparation methodologies Heterogeneous catalysis Suzuki cross-coupling reaction 1 Introduction Carbon-carbon bond formations have a great significance in pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries [1,2]. The Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction is a metal-catalysed organic reaction resulting in the production of biaryls. In that respect, the Suzuki reaction is one of the most efficient methods to form carbon-carbon bonds [3]. The reaction between aryl halides and aryl boronic acids is preferred compared to other cross-coupling reactions because of the mild reaction conditions and high variety and commercial availability of the boronic acids. In addition, the boronic acids are environmentally safer than their organometallic counterparts [3,4]. In industry, the Suzuki reaction is often carried out with homogeneous Pd catalysts such as Pd(PPh3)4 [3]. However, an important drawback is the difficulty to separate and reuse the catalyst, from the reaction medium. As a result, the remaining amount of Pd can pollute the final products [5,6]. Therefore, supported Pd nanoparticle (Pd-NP) catalysts have been investigated. Due to their small size, nanoparticles have an increased surface to volume ratio and thus, very high surface area, compared to their corresponding bulk material, resulting in high catalytic activities. Moreover, they possess unique properties due to quantum confinement. However, nanoparticles as catalysts need to be stabilized against self-aggregation [7,8]. Various supports such as metal oxides [9–11], zeolites [12,13], carbon structures [14–17], polymers [18–22], mesoporous silicas [23–26], natural phosphates [27–29], etc. were used to immobilize the Pd-NPs. An emerging class of supports are Layered Double Hydroxides (LDHs) and derived materials due to (i) the cation-tunability of the brucite-like layers (e.g., Mg, Al, Ni, Cu, Mo, Co, Pd, Cr, Fe,...), (ii) their tunable surface basicity and (iii) the uniform dispersion of M2+ and M3+ cations in the layers allowing the formation of highly dispersed supported catalysts. The M2+:M3+ ratio can be modified between 2:1 and 4:1 [30–36]. By calcining the LDH between 400 °C and 550 °C, the interlayer water and anions are evaporated, causing the layered structure to collapse and mixed metal oxides (MMO) to be formed [37–40]. Exposing these MMO structures to air causes a reconstruction of the LDH structure (i.e., memory effect) due to adsorption of water and carbon dioxide [41–45]. In addition, hydrotalcites (HTs) are naturally occurring minerals of the layered double hydroxide (LDH) family, with the general formula [(Mg6Al2(OH)14)2+(CO3 2−)]·4H2O, in which the Mg/Al molar ratio is 3:1 and CO3 2− ions are used to compensate the charge of the hydroxide layers created by the Al3+ [46–51]. HT supported Pd catalysts for the Suzuki reaction have been less studied in literature [52–56]. In 2008, Mora and co-workers reported the synthesis and catalytic performance of anionic clay based Pd2+ catalysts in the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction. Highly active HT supported Pd2+ catalysts were synthesized via different routes such as the intercalation of PdCl4 2− anions and the impregnation of Pd(CH3COO)2Py2 or PdCl2. Also, an LDH supported Pd2+ catalyst, synthesized via co-precipitation of PdCl2, was studied. The intercalation method showed low conversions (13%) in combination with extremely high leaching (94%). The HT catalyst impregnated by Pd(CH3COO)2Py2 exhibited the highest catalytic activity (52%), although it lost 27% of its initial Pd amount during reaction. The co-precipitated Pd2+ catalyst showed almost no conversion (<1%) in combination with no leaching [57,58]. In 2014, Mora et al. reported the synthesis of a HT supported Pd-NP catalyst via impregnation of a Pd2+ salt (0.60 wt% Pd), followed by a reduction with cyclohexene. High conversion (92%) was obtained when the Suzuki reaction between iodobenzene and phenylboronic acid was carried out in an aqueous medium at 100 °C for 10 min. However, the data is determined at relatively high reaction temperatures (i.e., the energy efficiency is rather low since Suzuki reactions are mainly performed below 80 °C) and specific leaching results were not mentioned for this reaction. Considering the Suzuki reaction between chlorobenzene and phenylboronic acid (68%), a hot filtration test demonstrated that the catalytic reaction partly occurred in the homogeneous phase [59]. To our knowledge, a co-precipitated HT supported Pd-NP catalyst has never been studied in the Suzuki reaction. In this work, the effect of the HT structure on the NP size and catalytic performance of supported Pd-NP catalysts (0.01 mmol Pd) was thoroughly examined in the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between iodobenzene and phenylboronic acid, in the presence of potassium carbonate as base and under mild reaction conditions. An uncalcined, co-precipitated HT supported Pd-NP catalyst, i.e., PdHT_100RED_20, was benchmarked against a Pd impregnated HT catalyst, i.e., Pd@HT_500RED_20. Besides studying the effect of the HT structure, the effect of the NP size on the catalytic performance of the PdHT_100RED_20 catalyst was investigated by varying the reduction temperature (0 °C–20 °C–60 °C). At last, the reusability of PdHT_100RED_20 was studied in a consecutive run. In that respect, a re-activation step with Na2CO3 was performed. Also, the conversion and Pd leaching were monitored as function of time. All Pd-NP catalysts were fully characterized by XRD, N2 sorption, TPD-CO2, ICP OES and TEM. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Preparation of palladium on hydrotalcite derived oxides by impregnation For a 5 g synthesis, 116.4 mL 3:1 Mg/Al-solution (1 M) was prepared from the respective nitrate salts Mg(NO3) (>98%, Carl Roth) and Al(NO3)3 (>98%, Carl Roth), and was added dropwise to 116.4 mL basic solution of 0.15 M NaCO3 (Carl Roth) and 2.2 M NaOH (Carl Roth) while sonicating (Elmasonic S100H instrument) at room temperature. The precipitates were repeatedly centrifuged (VWR Himac CT 6el centrifuge) for 3 min at 3000 rpm and washed with distilled water. Afterwards, it was pre-calcined for 4 h at 500 °C in air. The HT material is denoted as HT_500. Subsequently, an incipient wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution of Pd(NO3)2 (min. 32 wt%, Alfa Aesar) was performed to load 1 wt% (with respect to the catalyst amount) in HT_500. 1.2 mL Pd solution was slowly added to 1g HT_500. Thereafter, the Pd@HT sample was calcined under the same conditions as the HT_500 material. The Pd2+ supported HT derived mixed oxide was chosen as benchmark catalyst and named as follows: Pd@HT_500. XRD patterns and N2 sorption measurements of the calcined pristine HT (i.e., HT_500) and the impregnated supported HT derived oxide (i.e., Pd@HT_500) can be found in the Supporting Information (Figs. S1 & S4). 2.1.2 Synthesis of PdMgAl LDHs and derived oxides The PdMgAl LDHs were prepared by co-precipitation of Pd(NO3)2 (min. 32% Pd, Alfa Aesar). For a 5 g synthesis, 65.9 mL metal solution (1 M) with a Mg/Al molar ratio of 3:1 and a (Pd)/(Pd+Mg+Al) ratio of 0.01, was prepared from the respective nitrate salts Mg(NO3)2 (>98%, Carl Roth), Al(NO3)3 (>98%, Carl Roth) and Pd(NO3)2. This solution was added dropwise to 65.9 mL basic solution of 0.15 M Na2CO3 (Carl Roth) and 2.2 M NaOH (Carl Roth) while sonicating at room temperature. The precipitates were repeatedly centrifuged for 3 min at 3000 rpm and washed with distilled water. The solids were dried for 18 h at 100 °C and are denoted as PdHT_100. In order to fully comprehend the effect of the HT structure on the catalytic performance of Pd-NP catalysts, a PdHT_100 material was calcined for 4 h at 500°C in air and is denoted as PdHT_500. To study the effect of the support basicity, also a PdHT_100 material with a Mg/Al molar ratio of 2:1, i.e., PdHT_100 (2:1) was prepared by co-precipitation. XRD patterns and N2 sorption measurements of the uncalcined pristine HT (i.e., HT_100) and the PdMgAl LDH (i.e., PdHT_100) and its derived oxide (i.e., PdHT_500) can be found in the Supporting Information (Figs. S1, S2, S4 & S5). 2.1.3 Catalyst reduction All materials were washed with distilled water. Subsequently, 0.5 g Pd2+ containing support was converted into a HT supported Pd-NP catalyst using 25 mL 0.53 M of an aqueous NaBH4 (ChemLab, >95%) solution as reducing agent due to its very strong reducing character resulting in the desired NP size for high catalytic performances, i.e., below 10 nm [5,20,39]. The reduction temperature was generally set at 20 °C and was in addition evaluated at 0 °C and 60 °C for the PdHT_100 material. The reduction time was set at 18 h since at this point no more H2 formation was observed. After reduction, the catalyst was separated by centrifugation from the solution, washed again with distilled water to remove any remaining NaBH4 and eventually dried at 100 °C under inert atmosphere for 24 h. The reduced catalysts were stored under inert atmosphere to prevent oxidation of the metallic Pd and are denoted with RED_x, e.g., PdHT_100RED_20, i.e., PdHT_100 reduced at 20 °C. 2.2 Physicochemical characterization of the catalysts The crystal structure was determined with an ARLTM X'TRA powder diffractometer of Thermo Scientific. As a primary X-ray beam Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541838 nm) was used. The patterns were recorded from 5° to 70° in steps of 0.02°, with a measuring rate of 2°/min. The lattice constants (La, Lb and Lc) were derived from the interplanar distance (HT: d003 & d110) which was calculated using Bragg’s law. The crystal domain sizes (τ) were calculated using the Scherrer equation of the most intense peak (HT: d003). The specific surface area (S) and the total pore volume (Vp) were determined using N2 sorption with a Tristar II instrument of Micromeritics and calculated with BET and BJH equations respectively. Prior to this measurement, the catalysts were dried under vacuum at 120 °C for 2 h. The Pd content of the reduced catalysts was determined by ICP-OES (IRIS Intrepid II XSP instrument). The catalysts were dissolved in a 3:1 HCl (37 wt%) / H2O -mixture and heated to 125 °C for 3 h. The surface morphology of the catalysts was investigated by High Resolution FEG-TEM (JEM-2200FS, Cs corrected, 200 kV). The sample preparation was performed by suspending a small amount of catalyst (0.36 g) ultrasonically in 10 mL acetone for only 10 min. Subsequently, a HC200-Cu grid (200 mesh, 50 μm) was loaded with 5 μL of the suspension. For each catalyst, TEM analysis was performed and the NP size was analysed by ImageJ v1.6.0 processing software. The basic sites of the HT materials were determined by CO2 adsorption at room temperature and atmospheric pressure using Autosorb iQ from Quantachrome. Pulses of 284 μl CO2 were injected till no adsorption took place anymore. Before the adsorption, the catalysts were dried under vacuum at 100 °C for 1 h. An average of the maximum intensity was used and the sum of the missing peak areas ( ∑ i = 0 n ( A max − A injection, i ) ) has been calculated. This adsorption quantity was correlated with the CO2 loop injection volume and divided by the amount of catalyst used. 2.3 Catalytic reaction: Suzuki cross-coupling reaction The HT supported Pd-NP catalyst (0.01 mmol Pd) was mixed with iodobenzene (0.5 mmol, Merck), phenylboronic acid (0.75 mmol, Acros), K2CO3 (1.5 mmol, Merck) dissolved in a 1:1 DMF/H2O mixture (10mL) and brought together in a 100 mL batch reactor and stirred at 200 rpm in a shaker (Infors HT, Multitron Standard) for 45 min at 40 °C. After finishing reaction, the suspension was centrifuged in order to remove the catalyst. 1 mL of this liquid was taken and dissolved in 3:1 HCl/H2O to analyse the Pd leaching by ICP-OES. Subsequently, the organic compounds were extracted from the reaction mixture with 10mL dichloromethane. The iodobenzene conversion was quantitatively analysed by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (Thermo Finnigan Electron S.p.A). The resulting product, i.e., biphenyl, was identified from its retention time and observed in all chromatograms. A (35% -phenyl)-methyl polysiloxane capillary column (Agilent HP-35) was used for separation. The injection was carried out with an AS/AI 3000 autosampler (Thermo Finnigan Electron S.p.A) at 1 μL. The injector was operated in split mode (100:1) and the inlet temperature was 290 °C. The temperature profile started at 150 °C (i.e., column temperature). This level was held for 6 min, and subsequently, the temperature was increased at 15 °C/min to 200 °C and kept constant for 2 min. The detector temperature was set at 300 °C. All experiments were at least performed in twofold. The standard deviation was used as a measure of the experimental error. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 Structure and porous properties of the hydrotalcite supported palladium nanoparticle catalysts The layered structure and the crystallographic phases of the supports were analysed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the co-precipitated, i.e., PdHT_100RED_20 (uncalcined) and PdHT_500RED_20 (calcined), and impregnated Pd-NP catalysts, i.e., Pd@HT_500RED_20 (calcined). The XRD pattern of the PdHT_100RED_20 (uncalcined) material clearly resembles the brucite layered structure with distinct peaks corresponding to the (003), (006), (012), (015), (018), (110), (113) and (114) planes respectively. Also, the two calcined materials resemble the brucite layered structure since the reduction of the calcined oxide material in aqueous phase promotes the partial reconstruction of the HT structure (JCPDS 14-0191) due to the introduction of hydroxyl ions as compensating ions [44,45,48,51]. Some remaining oxide peaks corresponding to the (200) and (220) plane of the periclase structure, respectively at 42.9° and 62.3° (JCPDS 45-9846), confirm this reconstruction. No additional peaks assigned to Pd were observed due to, in terms of XRD, the low Pd content and the dominant (018) peaks of the HT structure (JCPDS 46-1043). The peak intensity depends on the synthesis method, and hence, the composition of the material. The partially reconstructed materials, i.e., PdHT_500RED_20 and Pd@HT_500RED_20 catalysts, gave a lower peak intensity than the PdHT_100RED_20 catalyst due to the rehydration of the former, resulting in less crystalline materials. The impregnated catalyst showed more narrow and intense diffraction peaks because it is defined as a binary MgAl system (i.e., HT structure), while the co-precipitated catalysts are ternary MgAlPd systems (i.e., LDH materials) which causes non-uniform strains, widening of the diffraction peaks and a lower ordering of the lattice. The lattice parameters and crystallite sizes are summarized in Table 1 . All catalysts have similar lattice parameters due to similar 2θ positions of the HT peaks in the XRD patterns [46,60]. However, differences in crystallite sizes were observed. The size of the formed hydroxide crystallites in the PdHT_100RED_20 catalyst is significantly larger than the crystallite sizes of the PdHT_500RED_20 and Pd@HT_500RED_20 catalysts due to the loss of interlayer water and ions. This loss leads to fracturing the grains, resulting in smaller crystallite sizes upon calcination to form the MMO and is confirmed by the broader peaks in the XRD pattern. In addition, the XRD patterns of the PdHT_100 material reduced at different temperatures (0 °C–20 °C–60 °C) showed that the temperature treatment had no change in the main structural characteristics of the support (Supporting Information, Fig. S3). The textural properties of the reduced materials were measured by N2 sorption (Fig. 2 ). All catalysts have type IV shaped curves which confirm their mesoporosity. Note that the PdHT_100RED_20 showed a well-defined hysteresis, compared to the ink-bottle shaped curves of the PdHT_500RED_20 and Pd@HT_500RED_20 catalysts, due to calcination and pore blocking. The PdHT_100RED_20 catalyst has a significantly higher specific surface area and total pore volume, compared to the PdHT_500RED_20 and Pd@HT_500RED_20 catalysts (Table 2 ). The low specific surface area and small pore volume of the calcined catalysts are attributed to a more pronounced pore blockage which is caused by the incorporation of Pd species as well as the reduction reaction in water and is confirmed by the N2 sorption isotherms of the pristine, Pd loaded and reduced materials (Supporting Information, Figs. S4 & S5). Since the basicity plays a key role in the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction [18,61–63], the basic sites were determined using TPD-CO2 (see Supporting Information, Figs. S6–S8). The PdHT_100RED_20 adsorbed 425 μmol CO2/g, in contrast to the PdHT_500RED_20 and Pd@HT_500RED_20 catalyst, which adsorbed 29 and 45 μmol CO2/g respectively. The PdHT_100RED_20 catalyst clearly possesses a higher basicity than the calcined catalysts due to carbonate ions in the intercalated layers. 3.1.2 Palladium nanoparticle size and distribution The discussion below is focused on semi-quantitative trends deduced from the combined data analysis of average NP sizes and their corresponding distributions. As a result, an overview of TEM images for each catalyst is added to the Supporting Information (Figs. S9–S11). 3.1.2.1 The effect of the hydrotalcite structure on the palladium nanoparticle size The NP size and distribution of the PdHT_100RED_20, PdHT_500RED_20, and Pd@HT_500RED_20 catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . TEM analysis showed the presence of Pd-NPs as dark dots in the HT structure. All catalysts mainly exhibited NP sizes below 10 nm (>75%). Comparing the uncalcined, co-precipitated catalyst (Fig. 3A) to the calcined, impregnated catalyst (Fig. 3C), the smallest NPs (3.2 nm) were found in the latter since the pre-calcination of the MgAl system (which is inherent for the impregnation method, as described by Tichit et al. [48]) as well as the calcination after Pd impregnation resulted in a collapsed structure with an undefined, irregular shape and pore blockage, as confirmed by XRD, TEM and N2 sorption measurements. As a result, the calcined catalyst caused a stronger steric NP confinement, as also reflected in the narrow NP size distribution. For the PdHT_100 material an ordered, well-defined hexagonal HT structure was obtained due to lack of calcination, promoting the formation of larger NPs (6.5 nm) with a broader size distribution. The effect of calcination on the NP size was considered by comparing the TEM images of a calcined, co-precipitated catalyst, i.e., PdHT_500RED_20 (Fig. 3B, 5.7 nm) to an uncalcined, co-precipitated catalyst, i.e., PdHT_100RED_20. Calcination caused a less ordered and less defined hexagonal shape of the HT structure. This irregular shape indicates the formation of MgAlO species, as reported by Martinez-Ortiz et al. [32], which slightly limited the NP size (Fig. 4 ). Overall, these results clearly prove the importance of (pre-)calcination in the synthesis of supported NPs with a well-controlled size. 3.1.2.2 The effect of the reduction temperature on the palladium nanoparticle size PdHT_100 was selected to study the effect of the reduction temperature on the NP size because of its ordered HT structure in combination with high support basicity. NP size distribution analysis pointed out that the NP size shifted to larger values and broader distributions when increasing the reduction temperature from 0 °C (5.3 nm) to 20 °C (6.5 nm). Upon higher reduction temperatures (60 °C), a decrease in NP size is observed (5.7 nm) (Fig. 5 ). It is known that the NP size can be tuned by controlling the nucleation and growth process which is highly influenced by the temperature [64,65]. At low reduction temperatures (0 °C), high supersaturation prevailed which caused an increase of nuclei, favoring fast nucleation, and ultimately resulted in the formation of relatively small NPs (5.3 nm). Increasing the reduction temperature to 20 °C decreases the supersaturation causing a decrease in nuclei, and thus, slower nucleation which enlarged the NP size (i.e., less small particles due to nuclei growth) (6.5 nm). Surprisingly, this trend did not continue at higher reduction temperatures. NaBH4 is known as a strong reducing agent that also releases H2 from its hydrolysis in aqueous medium [66]. Since the hydrolysis reaction rate of NaBH4 exponentially increases as function of the temperature [66], at 60 °C, it is presumed that the hydrolysis reaction predominated, and hence, reduced the efficiency of the reduction reaction, resulting in a shift of the NP size distribution to smaller NPs compared to PdHT_100RED_20. It is clear that the reduction temperature influenced the NP size (i.e., controlling the nucleation and growth process). Although, at higher temperatures, also the profound impact of the temperature on the reduction behavior of NaBH4 (i.e., reduction versus hydrolysis) needs to be taken into account. 3.2 The effect of the hydrotalcite structure on the catalytic performance of supported palladium nanoparticle catalysts ICP-OES analysis pointed out a Pd loading of 0.58 ± 0.01 wt%, 1.01 ± 0.01 wt% and 1.16 ± 0.04 wt% for the PdHT_100RED_20, PdHT_500RED_20 and Pd@HT_500RED_20 catalysts respectively. Since calcination, when compared to PdHT_100RED_20, causes a loss of ca. 40 wt% of the initial weight [50], for each catalyst, 0.01 mmol Pd was added to the reaction medium by adding different catalyst masses, i.e., 0.1826 g PdHT_100RED_20, 0.1050 g PdHT_500RED_20 or 0.0913 g Pd@HT_500RED_20. A higher conversion was observed for PdHT_100RED_20 (60%) when compared to PdHT_500RED_20 (24%) and Pd@HT_500RED_20 (19%) (Table 3 ) due to differences in HT structure. The more ordered and porous hexagonal HT structure of the former resulted in a much better accessibility of the Pd-NPs, and thus, a higher catalytic activity. Considering the impregnated catalysts, the PdHT_500RED_20 catalyst (24.2%) showed, despite its larger NPs (5.7 nm versus 3.2 nm), a higher catalytic activity than the Pd@HT_500RED_20 catalyst (19%) due to, again, a more accessible HT structure, as reflected by the relatively higher specific surface area and pore volume. It is clear that the accessibility of the HT structure is a decisive parameter in the catalytic performance of HT supported Pd-NP catalysts. (Table 4 ) Besides the accessibility of the active centers, also the support basicity plays also an important role. It is known that a basic co-reagent (in this work: CO3 2−) is necessary to initialize transmetallation and reductive elimination steps. [54,62] In that respect, the relatively high catalytic activity of PdHT_100RED_20 can be attributed to its higher support basicity (see TPD-CO2 results). This hypothesis is verified in three different ways. First, the basicity before and after reaction was measured. TPD-CO2 measurements before (425 μmol CO2/g) and after (266 μmol CO2/g) reaction showed a decrease in support basicity, strongly indicating the consumption of carbonate ions from the support during the reaction. Secondly, this result was strengthened by performing the Suzuki reaction without base. Without the addition of K2CO3, a low conversion was observed (24%). Thirdly, the promoting effect of the support basicity was shown by lowering the Mg/Al molar ratio to 2:1 for PdHT_100RED_20. PdHT_100RED_20 (2:1) catalyst obtained high conversion (75%) in combination with low leaching (2.29%) due to an increase of the number of Brønsted sites and thus, its higher support basicity. The combined data analysis of these three experiments clearly pointed out the promoting effect of the carbonate ions between the intercalated layers in the Suzuki reaction. The co-precipitated as well as impregnated catalysts exhibit low Pd leaching (≤5%) which confirms the suitability of HT materials as NP support (Table 3). The highest leaching was observed for the co-precipitated catalysts (1.85% (3:1); 2.29% (2:1)) due to their open HT structure which facilitated Pd leaching. The impregnated catalyst (i.e., Pd@HT_500RED_20) was expected to have the lowest leaching due to its more collapsed HT structure (i.e., pre-calcination and calcination) with pore blocking. However, a higher leaching (0.98%) was observed due to its smaller NPs (3.2 nm versus 5.7 nm for PdHT_500RED_20) which are able to migrate easier in the support and thus, also leach easier [67]. In addition, the decorating MgAlO patches [48] of PdHT_500RED_20 attributed to a hindrance of Pd leaching. However, note that both calcined catalysts obtain very low leaching (<1%). It is clearly shown that the HT structure has a significant effect on the NP size and catalytic performance of the Pd-NP catalysts. In order to exclude these structural effects and due to its high catalytic activity in combination with low leaching, PdHT_100RED_20 was selected in order to study only the effect of the reduction temperature on the NP size and catalytic performance. 3.3 The effect of the reduction temperature on the catalytic performance of supported palladium nanoparticle catalysts It is known that smaller NPs (10–100 nm) have very large surface to volume ratios, when compared to their corresponding bulk material, which results in high catalytic performances [7]. However, below 10 nm, this trend is not always valid and needs to be verified [68,69]. Since the nucleation of NPs is highly influenced by temperature [64,65], the effect of the reduction temperature on the NP size, and thus, catalytic performance of PdHT_100 was studied. A decrease in catalytic activity (from 67% to 60%) and leaching (from 2.28% to 1.85%) was observed when increasing the reduction temperature from 0 °C to 20 °C due to the shift of the NP size distribution to larger NPs which are less active and more sterically hindered, and thus, more difficult to leach [70]. A further increase in reduction temperature to 60 °C caused a drastic decrease in catalytic performance (13%, 0.20%) most likely due to the less efficient reduction reaction with NaBH4 at higher temperatures (Supporting Information, Table S2) upon the strongly promoted hydrolysis reaction [66]. It is clear that the reduction protocol needs to be optimized for each reduction temperature with respect to the catalytic performance. 3.4 Reusability In a first reuse of PdHT_100RED_20, its catalytic performance decreased significantly (45%, 0.66%) for 45 min reaction time. Since it is shown that the catalytic activity depends on the support basicity, the decreased catalytic activity can be caused by the loss of support basicity (from 425 to 266 μmol CO2/g). In that respect, a re-activation step was performed between a consecutive run by adding a 50 mL 0.06 M aqueous Na2CO3 solution to the used catalyst and stirring the suspension for 24 h at 25 °C, 200 rpm. Thereafter, the re-activated catalyst was screened in a second run. An increase in catalytic activity (50%) was observed when compared to the second run without regeneration (45%), indicating the re-activation step with Na2CO3 could be promising in obtaining reusablecatalysts with retention of the catalytic activity. Reusing PdHT_100RED_20 (without regeneration), also a decrease in Pd leaching was observed (from 1.85% to 0.66%). Since great ambiguity still exists about the true nature of cross-coupling catalysis [71–73], the leaching behavior of PdHT_100RED_20 was studied in a first run by monitoring the iodobenzene conversion and Pd leaching as function of time (Fig. 6 ). At the beginning, the Pd leaching increased with increasing conversion, until a conversion of 88% in combination with a Pd leaching of 2.60% was obtained after 60 min. Between 60 and 90 min, the Pd leaching reached its maximum, whereafter full conversion (100% after 90 min) ensured that the decrease in Pd leaching stagnated and converged to 0.45% after 180 min and to 0.22% after 24 h. In addition, the leaching profile indicated a pseudo-homogeneous (i.e., the re-deposition of Pd species) [71–73] catalyzed Suzuki reaction. In order to reduce the loss of Pd species to a minimum in consecutive runs, it is recommended to perform the reaction till full conversion, and thus, low leaching. 4 Conclusion In this study, it is shown that (i) the HT structure as well as (ii) the reduction temperature have a significant effect on the NP size and catalytic performance of HT supported Pd-NP catalysts. (i) An uncalcined, co-precipitated HT supported Pd-NP catalyst (6.5 nm), i.e., PdHT_100RED_20 (60% conversion, 1.85% leaching), was benchmarked against a Pd impregnated HT catalyst (3.2 nm), i.e., Pd@HT_500RED_20 (19%, 0.98%). The higher catalytic performance for the former was obtained due to the lack of calcination resulting in an ordered and porous hexagonal HT structure causing a high accessibility of the active centers in combination with the high support basicity. Hence, when catalyzing basic promoted organic reactions, uncalcined, co-precipitated HT supported Pd-NP catalysts are preferred above the calcined, impregnated ones. (ii) An increased reduction temperature from 0 °C to 20 °C resulted in a slightly decreased catalytic activity (from 67% to 60%) due to the larger NPs (5.3 nm versus 6.5 nm respectively) according to the NP size distributions. At higher reduction temperatures (60 °C, 5.7 nm), the catalyst exhibited extremely low catalytic activity (13%). Therefore, it is recommended to perform the reduction at 20 °C due to the energy efficiency of this process and the high catalytic activity (60%) in combination with low leaching (1.85%) of PdHT_100RED_20. Moreover, the effect of the reduction temperature on the behavior of the reducing agent, and thus, on the size and catalytic performance of the NPs needs to be carefully considered. Since PdHT_100RED_20 is preferred for catalyzing basic promoted organic reactions, its reusability was studied. In a first reuse, a decrease in catalytic activity from 60% (and 1.85% leaching) to 45% (and 0.63% leaching) was observed. The re-activation of the support basicity with an aqueous Na2CO3 solution (50% conversion) in combination with fully re-deposition of Pd species (full conversion, 0.45% leaching after 3h) are promising steps in obtaining reusable HT supported Pd-NP catalysts for basic promoted organic reactions. Overall, HT materials are suitable supports for Pd-NP stabilization in liquid-phase catalysis, in particular in the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between iodobenzene and phenylboronic acid under mild reaction conditions, due to their enormous structural versatility with tunable surface basicity resulting in high catalytic active and low leaching Pd-NP catalysts.

TEM analysis pointed out that the largest NPs (6.5 nm) were found in the co-precipitated catalyst because of its weaker steric NP confinement, compared to the benchmark catalyst (3.2 nm). The PdHT_100RED_20 had a significantly higher catalytic performance (60% conversion, 1.85% leaching) than Pd@HT_500RED_20 (19%, 0.98%) due to lack of calcination resulting in an ordered, and thus, more accessible HT structure in combination with its high support basicity. Both catalysts showed low Pd leaching confirming the suitability of HTs as NP support. Focusing on PdHT_100, the effect of the reduction temperature on the NP size and catalytic performance was investigated. NP size distribution analysis showed that the smallest NPs were found in PdHT_100RED_0 (5.3 nm), resulting in a higher catalytic performance (67%, 2.28%) when compared to PdHT_100RED_20 (6.5 nm). Performing the reduction at higher temperatures, i.e., at 60 °C (5.7 nm), caused an extremely low catalytic performance (13%, 0.20%) due to the less efficient reduction reaction with NaBH4 at higher reduction temperatures. Reusing PdHT_100RED_20, a decrease in catalytic performance (45%) was observed. However, this decrease was less pronounced (50%) when a re-activation of the catalyst with Na2CO3 between consecutive runs was performed. Moreover, it was shown that the leached Pd species were able to re-deposit onto the support if high conversions were obtained, and thus, an almost quantitatively recovery from the reaction mixture can be achieved with retention of its catalytic activity (>99%).",
