(+44-31)6506452 (Received December 1, 1992; accepted February 1, 1993 ) Abstract 51 A critical view of the use of molecular clusters as models of metallic catalysts and as means of modelling chemistry at the surface is presented. The major problems that still exist in the identification of surface adsorbed species and the bonding modes they adopt on reaction with the variety of different metal faces available on the surface of close-packed metal arrays are identified. Limitations have been placed on any direct comparisons because of the relatively small size of clusters under examination and the non-planar characteristics. The use of molecular clusters in this way has led to a much clearer understanding of the bonding mode adopted by a variety of chemisorbed species and can provide answers to long-standing problems. Key words: metallic catalysts; molecular clusters Introduction Heterogeneous catalysis forms the fundamental basis of many important industrial processes and yet our understanding of the associated basic surface chemistry is generally poorly understood at a molecular level. The characterisation of the chemisorbed substrate presents an enormous challenge. The usual physical techniques of structure elucidation or analysis, such as X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy, used routinely by molecular chemists to define the essential stereochemical features of a molecule, are not generally applicable to these highly ordered surfaces. Even widely employed techniques such as IR or Raman spectroscopy must be exercised with caution. Selection rules for substrates bonded to macroscopic surfaces differ from those at the molecular level and on bonding, the structure and symmetry of the chemisorbed species may undergo significant change. Among the techniques employed by surface scientists are low energy electron diffraction (LEED), angle-resolved UV 'Corresponding author. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 - Elsevier Science B.V.

The experimental and theoretical details of their implementation are by no means trivial and they do not offer the precision available in molecular structural analysis [ 1 ] . From this background it has been argued that discrete, molecular metal cluster complexes may serve as good models for the chemisorbed state [ 2-7 ] . The single-crystal metallic surface may be considered as being composed of an approximately close-packed array of spherical atoms arranged infinitely in a two dimensional lattice. It is from this geometrical standpoint that clusters and the surface bear the closest similarities. However, it must be remembered that one of the consequences of this long range periodicity within the two dimensional array is that local atomic and electronic structure will be influenced by more distant atoms in the plane and, if we extend the two dimensional closepacked lattice into a three dimensional network, by atoms within the bulk of the lattice. In this case, because small clusters contain only surface atoms, similarities will exist only for the very largest clusters. Thus, any analogy between cluster species and the bulk metallic interface is limited, since any collective electronic and structural characteristics of the metallic lattice may have no counterparts amongst molecular clusters containing relatively few metal atoms. The bonding of small molecules such as CO to small clusters involves a more localised substrate-metal interaction than on a metal surface. Nevertheless, the limitations imposed by this constraint need not necessarily restrict the modelling of the adsorption process by this means. In general, it would appear that close similarities exist, at least in the structural characteristics, of substrate bonded to one, two, three or four metals in the cluster and on the surface, and frequently their spectroscopic properties are similar. Structure Even the largest discrete molecular clusters are only submicroscopic fragments of a metal surface. Nevertheless, we frequently find that the metal skeletons of high nuclearity carbonyl cluster compounds are structurally comparable to fragments of bulk metallic lattices. For example, [ Rh13 (CO) 24H3 ] 2 is a thirteen atom fragment of an hexagonal close-packed array [ 8 ] , [ Ilh14 (CO) 25 ] 2- is recognisable as a fragment of body-centred cubic packing [ 9 ] and [ OO2p (CO) 42 ] 2 - forms a segment of a cubic close-packed lattice [ 10 ] . The dianions [Os1oC(CO)24]2- and [HOslp(CO)26]- are examples of a microscopic fragment of cubic close-packing with an interstitial carbido- or hydrido-atom respectively. For smaller carbonyl clusters, the cluster units are typically deltahedra or some slightly modified form and may, in general, be regarded as microscopic fragments of a typical close-packed lattice. However, we should recognise that this is not always the case, and in 086 (CO) 18 we see BYG. Johnson et al. / J. MaL CataL 86 (1994) 51-69 53 a prototypical example of a condensed polytetrahedral structure and in [RI16C(CO)16]2- the more open trigonal prismatic arrangement. The role of the ligand sphere in stabilising these geometries is of the utmost importance and the arrangement of metal atoms is governed by the number and type of ligands present. Addition of ligands, such as CO or H, or electron-pairs can bring about a fundamental change in cluster shape. This is particularly obvious for the series of hegaosmium cluster species, Ose (CO )18 (bicapped tetrahedron) , H20ag (CO )18 (monocapped square-based pyramid) , Oae ( CO ) $ (octahedron) and Oss (CO) 21 (planar) . The observation that fivefold symmetry is commonly observed for small naked crystallites in preference to the cubic or close-packed structures for the bulk metal [ 11-13 ] should not be forgotten. For small numbers of metal atoms (several thousands) it would appear that in the absence of liganda the closest packed arrangement, viz. fused tetrahedra with fivefold symmetry, is attainable. As the number of metal atoms increases, because of the complexity of packing, a transition from fivefold to sigfold symmetry is expected and observed. It would appear that comparison between the chemisorbed state and ligated metal clusters are best made when there is correspondence in the metal, ligands and ligand coverage of the cluster or surface and in the crystallography. The problem that a flat or nearly flat surface cannot be modelled by a spherical or nearly spherical cluster must be emphasised. Metal-metal coordination numbers for surface atoms in a cluster are less than on low Miller index planes and in many clusters there are only surface atoms (see above ), clearly limiting their metal-metal connectivities. In contrast, the metal-ligand connectivity is frequently larger for the clusters and coordination numbers of 2-4 (or even more) are commonly found. The most important general conclusion that can be made regarding the structure and stereochemistry in clusters is that many ligands exhibit multicentre metal atom interactions. These interactions appear to be sOar to those found for the chemisorbed species and as we shall see, the ability to classify exactly the bonding type within the cluster and to determine its spectroscopic properties precisely has proved to be the most valuable aid in the identification of the chemisorbed state. Mobility Studies of metal clusters and of the chemisorbed molecules have revealed that the ligands and chemisorbed molecules are not stationary. Flusionality in clusters is a well established phenomenon and both the ligand shell and the metal shell can undergo motion. Clearly the energy of such interconversion processes falls below that of bond-breakage. Motion of substrates on the surface is also well established and undoubtedly is of major importance. Flusionality in metal clusters falls within the NMR timescale, although recent (albeit 54 BYG. Johnson et ad. /J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 51-69 limited) evidence has been taken to suggest that ligands may also exchange positions on the IR timescale. For mobility on the surface, detection is by field emission microscopy. There is growing evidence to confirm that the metal cluster unit undergoes rearrangement or distortion during the fluxional process and that on occasion the metal surface undergoes comparable reorganisation. The number of ligands per metal atom generally exceeds that observed for substrate on a metal surface (see above). Ligand-connectivities for metal atoms in clusters are large, 2 to 5, whereas for surface metal atoms the connectivities are small, 1 or less on average. The number of metal-ligand connections in clusters is metal dependent and cluster size dependent. Only for the late transition metals are the electronic demands satisfied by low ligand : metal ratios and in Pt18 (CO) 2 we have a rare example of the ratio < 1. In the series Os3(CO)12) Os4(CO)169 Os5(CO)169 Oa6(CO)laP [Oa10(CO)26)]2- and [ Os20 (CO) 42 ] 2 - we see the ligand : metal ratio decreasing from 1: 3 to a ratio approaching 1: 2. This effect will be reflected in the metal-metal bond strength and the degree of flusionality - the fewer the ligands the less the spatial demand and the more readily migration may occur over the cluster surface. Ligand types Studies of the organometallic clusters with hydrocarbon ligands have revealed a richly diverse chemistry; coordinated molecular species like alkenes, alkynes and aromatics, as well as radicals (alkyl groups, alkylidenes, alkylidynes, arynes) exhibit a great range of structural types with an emphasis on multicentre metal atom interactions [ 6 ] . Continued interest in the chemistry of transition metal cluster complexes is almost certainly due in part to the possibility of deriving molecular insights into such industrially important surface-catalysed processes as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, isomerisation, oligomerisation, polymerisation and hydrocarbon reforming from such organometallic cluster species. Thermodynamics Thermodynamic data for metal-metal interactions in neither clusters nor metal surfaces are easily accessible by experiment. Although the agreement between calorimetric data for average metal-metal bond energies in clusters [ 14 ] and calculated bond energies for the bulk [ 15 ] is frequently close [ 6,16 ] , the associated uncertainties preclude meaningful quantitative comparisons. More importantly, the magnitude of these energies in the two regimes accounts for the rather pervasive structural instability of cluster frameworks. The underlying bulk of a metal crystal generally acts as a rigid template for the surface atoms, although adsorbate-induced reconstructions are known [ 17 ] . BYG. Johnson et al. / J. Mod. Catal. 86 (1994) 51-69 55 Metal-ligand bond enthalpies may be determined more reliably, particularly for surfaces, where adsorption-desorption equilibria are readily probed. For CO ligands, energies are typically 30-50% smaller for the chemisorbed state [ 18 ] , but increase as the crystallography is varied from densely packed to more open planes [ 19 ] (i.e. as the metal connectivity approaches that of the cluster regime). Theoretical treatment of the chemisorption bond based on cluster models for the adsorption site has shown that the largest portion of the chemisorptive enthalpy arises from `local' bonding contributions, although better estimates are obtained when the non-nearest neighbour interactions are also considered [ 20 ] . A related aspect of chemisorptive energetics concerns the variation in adsorption energy for a species across a given surface, which determines the activiation energy, EU, for surface diffusion. The primary technique for direct atomic observation of adsorbate mobility is field emission microscopy, although indirect evidence for surface diffusion may be afforded by spectroscopic or calorimetric measurements [6 ] . Typically Elff is found to be less than 20% of the adsorption enthalpy [ 16 ] , indicating that adsorbed species will, on average, undergo many migration steps on a metal surface before thermally desorbing. If Elff is of the order of kT, the adsorbate will behave rather like a two dimensional gas, while if Elff > kT, the particles will reside mainly in localised vibrational states at the equilibrium sites and their diffusive motion will consist of transitions between negative sites. The cluster counterpart to adsorbate mobility is ligand flugionality, probed effectively to the mechanistic level by NMR spectroscopy [ 21 ] . Ligand migration between terminal, bridging and threefold sites may be low energy processes in both the molecular and heterogeneous regimes, though the transition state geometries adopted in many cluster processes may be physically unreasonable on flat, close-packed surfaces. A benzene ligand migration pathway in derivatives of cluster complexes (see below) may relate realistically to aromatic species chemisorbed on surfaces. Clearly, such migration processes are of considerable relevance with respect to heterogeneous and molecular catalysis by these systems. Electronic properties There is currently great interest in the fundamental issue of where and how the metallic state begins and ends [ 22-25 ] . That is, at what stage of cluster growth are metallic properties realised and, conversely, how finely divided must a metal become before it ceases to behave as a metal? The discrete valence electronic levels of a single metal atom split and represent delocalised wave functions when several metal atoms form the skeleton of a cluster [ 25 ] . With increasing cluster size, the HOMO-LUMO gap diminishes, converging to the work function of the bulk metal, with the discrete orbitals of molecular species evolving into the band structure of the solid state. 56 BYG. Johnson et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 51-69 The properties of small ( < 10 metal atoms) clusters are certainly far from metal-like, but as Muetterties [6] points out, it is a comparison between (i) a molecular metal cluster with a polyhedral metal core and (generally) a periphery of ligands and (ii) a metal surface with a similar set of ligands chemisorbed at the surface, that is the basis of the cluster-surface analogy. The suggestion is, therefore, that there is no basic difference between valence electronic properties of the metal-ligand bond between the two regimes. UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) provides a means of probing the relative binding energies of valence levels in clusters and surfaces and results obtained for CO [26,27] and PF3 [28] appear closely analogous for the two states. Although an essential underlying relationship is implied here, it does not necessarily follow from these measurements alone that strong similarities exist between the bonding systems [6,29] The vibrational analogy High resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) can provide vibrational information from well-defined chemisorbed surfaces [ 30,31 ] . There are two inelastic scattering mechanisms responsible for the observed electron energy loss peaks in HREELS: dipole scattering and impact scattering. Losses that are the result of dipole scattering satisfy the surface dipole selection rule and correspond to totally symmetric vibrational modes of the adsorbate perpendicular to the surface. These appear as scattering lobes strongly peaked in the apecular direction. Impact scattering produces a broad angular scattering distribution and the losses do not satisfy this selection rule. Within the approximation of a localised bonding model for the moleculesurface complex the vibrational modes of the adsorbed species should directly reflect molecular orientation on the surface and the coordination geometry with respect to the underlying metal crystal face. Thus the vibrational frequencies of ligands attached to clusters and surfaces should be quite analogous. Recent extended Mickel calculations have identified just the orbital interactions in CO chemisorption that occur in discrete molecular carbonyl complexes (viz. donation from CO 5 < to metal dZZ and back acceptance into 2n from d,,z) and we have previously noted the assignments of CO adsorption sites via this analogy. Another elegant example of this concept is the identification of ethylidene cluster complex [ Co3 (CO) g (03-CCH3) ] [ 32,33 ] (see below). Evidently the inference of surface crystallography from vibrational spectroscopic analogies potentially represents one of the most informative aspects of the cluster-surface relationship. The significance of non-local phenomena should not be overlooked, however, since absorption frequencies frequently show marked dependence on surface coverage and crystal-face index [ 29 ] . The communication between adsorbate molecules may be substantially more pro- BYG. Johnson et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 51-69 57 nounced than between ligands in cluster complexes, this enhanced interaction being mediated via conduction electrons in the bulk. Reactivity patterns The theme of the preceding discussion has been one of cautious assent for a cluster-surface analogy based on localised bonding descriptions of the cluster-ligand, surface adsorbate interactions. A comparison of reactivity patterns for clusters and surfaces represents, perhaps, the most stringent test of the analogy and it is here that the correspondence is poorest. The catalytic properties of these systems are vastly different, implying that the spatial extent of bonding is not the salient characteristic determining the chemistry of surfaces. There is a growing body of evidence [ 16,34 ] that the dissociative adsorption essential to heterogeneous catalysis occurs at \"ensembles\" of free metal atoms, readily provided by the coordinatively flexible metal surface. The requisite substrate binding sites are not available in coordinatively saturated cluster complexes (analogous to saturation coverage of a surface) and ligand dissociation is typically accompanied by structural reorganisation or cluster breakdown. Some examples 1. Molecular models for Onzene-metal surface chemistry Structure and bonding Recent advances in the dynamical theory of low energy electron diffraction (LEED) by ordered adsorbate overlayers has led to the structural characterisation of several metal surface-benzene complexes by Somorjai, Van Hove and co-workers [ 35-39 ] . The technique relies on the fitting of calculated diffraction intensities to the experimental data set and differs fundamentally from the X-ray diffraction method in that the \"correct\" structure must initially be predicted [ 40 ] . Optimised structures of the surface complexes Rh (111) (3X3)-C6H6+2C0 (a) [37], Rh(111)-c{2ss)1/ZX4} rect-C6HB+CO (b) [38], Rh(111)-{2(3)1/2X3} rect-2C6Hg (c) [38] and Pt(111)-{2(3)1/2X4} rect-2C6Hg+4C0 (d) [36] are illustrated in Fig.1. In each overlayer benzene is chemisorbed intact and lies parallel to the close-packed metal surface. In (a ) and (b) adsorption occurs at a threefold hcp-type site, with an expanded Cg ring showing in-plane Kekule distortions: C-C bond distances alternate between 1.46 (15) and 1.58 (15) A in (a) and between 1.31(15) and 1.81(15) A in (b ), the short bonds lying above single metal atoms, while the long C-C bonds form bridges linking pairs of metal atoms. Although the CO-free structure (c) has not been analysed in detail, the principal features are known; the superlattice contains two benzene molecules per unit cell occupying twofold bridging sites. Bridge site occupancy has been substantiated in the ordered 58 BYG. Johnson et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 51-69 (e) o 2.31 2.30 C. 1 30 (b) Fig. 1.

The CO site symmetry for the coadsorbate systems parallels the benzene orientation in each case. BYG. Johnson et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 51-69 59 These studies demonstrate interesting cooperative effects between chemisorbed species; viz. coadsorption can induce or modify long-range order in overlayers. Coadsorption of C6Hg and CO generates new ordering arrangements not present in the adsorption of either species alone, with the tendency being for both molecules to move towards higher coordination sites in the mixed systems. This behaviour may well arise through metal-mediated charge transfer effects from benzene to CO [ 37 ] . Work function measurements for Pt (111) [41 ] and Rh (111) [42,43 ] indicate substantial benzene X-electron donation to the surface at saturation coverage and the greater back-bonding ability of CO at triply-bonding adsorption sites over alternative twofold or on-top positions is borne out both in theory [ 44 ] and experiment [45 ] . Close analogies with carbonyl cluster chemistry should be evident here. Conflicting structural studies on the Rh (111) systems have been reported by Netzer's group using angle-resolved UV photo-emission spectroscopy (ARUPS) [ 42,43,46 ] . The photo-emission behaviour for the adsorbate complexes in the (3 X 3) and c{2 (3 )112 X 4} rect superlattices is apparently described satisfactorily by Cs symmetry and interpreted in terms of undistorted benzene coordination at on-top sites with the ring planes parallel to the surface planes. The same technique detects Kekule distortion of benzene chemisorbed on Os (001) [ 47 ] and Ir (111) [ 48 ] and this trigonal deformation probably arises from adsorption at threefold sites on these close-packed surfaces (adsorption sites symmetry appears to have no decisive influence on molecular photo-emission [47] ). Benzene adsorption on Rh (111) [ 49 ] , Ni (111) and Pt (111) [ 50 ] surfaces has been treated theoretically by the extended Huckel method. Substrates were modelled as clusters of 3 to 17 metal atoms or as periodic surfaces in the tight binding [ 49 ] . Variations in cluster size are reported to alter the absolute (but not relative) binding energies of these complexes and have little effect on the calculated adsorbate geometries. In each case, adsorption is favoured at threefold hcp hollow sites, although the C2 bridging sites also seem energetically accessible. The preferred benzene orientation mirrors that found in LEED structures (a) and (b) (Fig.1, above) and bond overlap populations suggest significant ring expansion concomitant with Kekule-type distortion (on Rh (111) a C-C bond length alternation between 1.50 and 1.64 A is predicted) [ 49 ] . These studies further predict that the C-H bonds will bend away from the metal surface (by about 20 on Rh (111) and Pt (111) resulting from rehybridisation of the n system to maximise overlap with the metal-based orbitals [ 50 ] . The synthesis and structures of the benzene-carbonyl clusters [Osa(CO)9Q11a:q2:q2:q2-C6Hs)] (1) and [RugC(CO)ii(Ns:i72:?12:tl2-CsHs)] (2) were first reported by Johnson and co-workers in 1985 [51]. Later the ruthenium analogue, [ Ru3 (CO) 9 (/A3 : r2 : r2 : rf-C6Hg) ], and a whole series of arene clusters based on M3, M4, Ru6C and RueC were prepared and characterised (see below) . 60 BYG.

Furthermore, and in line with prediction (see above), the C-H bonds bend away from the M3 triangular face. This Kekule distortion may be traced to an internal mixing of the benzene n-system that leads to increased overlap in the three C-C bonds eclipsing the metal atoms, at the expense of the alternate non-eclipsing bonds which consequently become elongated. Mixing between the highest occupied and the lowest occupied benzene 7c orbitals has also been recognised in cluster models for the C3 Rh (111)benzene surface complex [49] and is believed to account for the small but significant trigonal distortions found in ?r-arene complexes of Cr [52 ] , Mo and W [53]. Coadsorption of potassium with benzene on Pt (111) decreases the arene adsorption enthalpy, reaching a minimum at 0.2-0.3 of a monolayer and then is increased again with further potassium coverage [ 54 ] . Electron donation to the surface complex from potassium raises the Pt valence band in energy (i.e. decreases the ionisation potential) and the resulting effect on the adsorbate binding energy has been calculated by Anderson et al. [50] (see Fig. 2 ). At low potassium coverage there is very little back-bonding to the vacant benzene n\"` orbitals as the metal s-d band is low-lying in energy: there is net benzene-to-metal n donation and the ring is positively charged ( see above). On shifting the Pt band up, the binding energy decreases and then increases at high cathodic charging, when Pt donation to the benzene LUMO becomes favourable and the ring carbons acquire a negative charge [ 50 ] . Our FenakeHall calculations indicate significant n back-donation occurs to the face-capping arene ligand in the molecular complex (1), suggesting that this cluster is best regarded as a model for a cathodically charged benzene-surface complex.

Curves 1 and 3 for -1 charge Pt., clusters, Oth 1 and 3 impaired electrons, respectively. Curve 2 for uncharged Pt,. We can simulate anodic charging of (1) by protonation at the metal triangle; as expected, the metal-benzene interaction in the cationic complex [ HOs3 (CO) a (#3 : t z : r' : rP-C6Hg) ] + (3) is weakened relative to (1) (as evidenced by vibrational spectroscopy) reflecting the poorer donor properties of the positively charged metal core. Thus, within the framework of a localised description of the surface-adsorbate bonding, complex (3) would appear the better model for the Rh (111) or Pt (111)-benzene chemisorption systems. Remarkably, the analogy may be extended, in a formal sense, to a comparison of cluster and surface reactivities. Vibrational spectroscopy Characterisation of molecular counterparts to the threefold chemisorption site for benzene has enabled Anson [55 ] to investigate aspects of the cluster-surface vibrational spectroscopic analogy. HREEL spectra for benzene overlayers on low Miller index Re [56], Rh [57], Ni [58-61] and Pt [38,41,58] surfaces have been reported and are dominated by intense losses near 700-850 cm-1, attributed to the symmetric out-of-plane bending mode ycH. This seems consistent with planar benzene adsorption parallel to the metal surfaces (Noting the surface selection rule) . HREELS data for the Rh (111) surface structure (II) (in Fig. 1) is better matched by spectra of the #3-benzene complexes (1)- (3) than by spectra of conventionally q-bonded arene complexes like [ Cr (CO) 3 (r6-C6Hg) ] [ 55 ] . Not surprisingly, the vcc modes appear most sensitive to Kekule distortion of the ring and the closest agreement is obtained with cationic (3 ), as previously surmised. Somewhat disconcerting is the lack of appreciable frequency variation between the benzene-surface complexes based on twofold and threefold adsorp- 62 B.RG. Johnson et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 51-69 tion sites [ 55 ] . It should be noted that the resolution of the EEL experiment is substantially poorer than that of solution or gas-phase IR and Raman spectroscopy and more subtle details of the vibrational signatures of the adsorbates may well be obscured. Moreover, large loss contributions from impact rather than dipole scattering [57,62] contrive to hinder symmetry assignments in these HREEL spectra. Reactivity Thermal desorption and molecular displacement reactions of benzene have been studied by Muetterties and co-workers on flat and stepped Pt surfaces [ 7,63,64 ] . At 298K, benzene chemisorbs molecularly on Pt (111) and can largely (ca. 90%) be displaced by PMe3 at this temperature. The thermal desorption behaviour from this surface appears consistent with two differential desorption sites that are interconvertible only at saturation coverage. Irreversible chemisorption of benzene increases significantly on a stepped Pt 6 (111) X (111) surface at less than 0.33 of a monolayer, while reversible adsorption at two distinct sites is found at higher coverages. Deuteration studies clearly demonstrate that at elevated temperatures reversible C-H bond cleavage can occur, but only in the more strongly bound state. This H-D exchange process is not observed on the flat Pt (111) surface [ 7 ] . Evidently intrinsic topographical features of the stepped surface favour the dissociative chemisorption of benzene. It seems likely that planar coordination of the arene parallel to a terrace of the surface provides for close approach of its hydrogens to the step atoms of a second terrace, facilitating C-H bond cleavage (see Fig. 3a) . The cluster [ Ru6C (CO) 13 (14 - PPh) (Jub - C6H4) ] (4 ), an attractive model for this process, has recently been described by Knox et al. [ 65 ] ; the five metal atoms of (4) are arranged as on a step site on a (111) surface (Figs. 3a-3c) and the yfi-benzene fragment may be viewed as a result of activation of two ortho C-H bonds of benzene chemisorbed at a threefold site on an adjacent terrace. There is an interesting trend in the metal surface reactivity of benzene on moving across the transition series. At ambient temperature on atomically flat surfaces, benzene adsorbs associatively on Ni, Pt and Rh (see above), with partial dissociation on Re [66] and is completely dissociated at low coverage on W (100) [ 67 ] . Furthermore, the decrease in work function. d O for the metals, brought about by saturation coverage of C6Hs, becomes smaller from Pt (-1.52 eV) [41 ] to W (- 0.3 eV) [ 67 ] and indicates a dramatic reduction in n-donation from the ring to the earlier transition metal surface. An analogous progression between associative and dissociative chemisorption exists for CO and has been analysed by Hoffmann [44 ] in terms of increasing back donation to the CO 2n-orbital as the Fermi level of the metal rises (from Ni to Ti).

Facile cluster activation could, perhaps, be expected here. Indeed, the highly efficient 64 BYG. Johnson et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 51-69 photo-induced isomerisation of (1) to the previously characterised sst3-benzyne complex, [H20O3 (CO) 9 (.t3 : lql : rP : r7l-C6H4) ] (5) is described- H H C~> H \\,~H 1, 1 Toluene,278 H hv,13 his H~ (1) l~ / Os (5) We suggest that photolysis generates a vacant site at osmium (mimicking the inherent coordinative unsaturation of a metal surface) and that this transformation offers a compelling model for the interconversion of associatively and dissociatively chemisorbed benzene. Moreover, we can fine-tune the molecular \"work function\" (really the HOMO/LUMO energies) by protonation or by phosphine substitution for CO at the metal, stabilising and destabilising respectively the valence orbitals of the cluster. Thus the cationic complex does not undergo internal metallation, while photoisomerisation of the electronrich phosphine derivatives [ 083 (CO) e _ n (PPh3) n (u3 : r 2 : 112 : e-C6Hg) ] , n =1 or 2, proceeds more readily than for (1), becoming increasingly facile with increasing substitution. The intermediacy of surface bound ,u3-benzyne moieties in heterogeneously catalysed deuterium exchange reactions of benzene would also appear quite feasible [68,69]. King et al. [70,71] have reported that the exchange reaction of chemisorbed benzene CsHs (C6Dg) with D2 (Hz) on a reconstructed Pt (110) - (1 X 2) surface occurs readily near 330 K with a rate law that is second order in ligand CH content, and shows a large deuterium isotope effect. EELS studies infer an initially planar, parallel and non-dissociatively adsorbed benzene coordination, and propose an H2 addition-elimination mechanism for the exchange reaction. As Anson [ 55 ] points out, the Pt (110) - (1 X 2)-C6H6 EEL spectrum clearly differs from other spectra where planar, parallel coordination is better established, and we concur that adsorption at a threefold site on the side of a ridge in the reconstructed surface (Fig. 4), with partial or complete Fig. 4. Schematic view of reconstructed Pt (110) - (1 X 2) surface. BYG. Johnson et al. /J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 51-69 65 dissociation towards a benzene-type structure may more reasonably explain this exchange chemistry. The thermal decomposition of benzene follows a rather different course on the Rh (111) surface at 400-500 K than on Pt and W surfaces. Deuterium labelling studies give no evidence for C-H bond cleavage and the suggestion is that C-C bond scission initiates the decomposition, with benzene decyclotrimerisation occurring to give three acetylenes that immediately fragment at the surface, affording chemisorbed methylidene (CH) and ethynyl (CZH) as the final products [ 72 ] . Identical decomposition fragments are observed from acetylene under these conditions, and their structures inferred from spectroscopic comparisons with [ H3Ru3 (CO) a (jt3-CH) ] and [ H083 (CO) 9 (93 : r2CCH) ] . Interestingly, the strongly Kekule-distorted Rh (111)-C6Hg + CO structure (b) (Fig.1) may be viewed as a snapshot of this putative decylisation reaction. In the limit of our analogy, thermally (or ogidatively?) induced C-C bond cleavage in cationic complex (3) should not seem implausible (we have not investigated this ); it should be noted, however, that the reverse alkyne cyclotrimerisation process does appear favourable in some triosmium cluster chemistry [ 73 ] . Finally, we note that a plausible primary intermediate in the surface-catalysed hydrogenation of benzene is suggested by our observation of the first well-defined example of metal-to-arene hydrogen migration in a molecular complex. Hydrogen addition to a labile acetonitrile derivative of (1) affords the dihydride compound [ H20S3 (CO) 8 (Et3 : tP : r2 : r 2-C6Hg) ] (8 ), which undergoes either mild dissociative addition of CO to yield the triply bridging cyclohesadienyl complex [ HOs3 (CO )e (sst3 : r 2 : rf : t2-C6H7) ] (9 ), or CO addition with the loss of HZ to regenerate (1) . Complex (9) may formally be dehydrogenated in two steps to complex (1), completing the cycle as illustrated below. The intermediacy of surface-bound dienyl complexes in arene hydrogenations has previously been postulated [69,74], though to our knowledge the underlying site symmetry of such species has not been considered in detail. A further feature that emerges from studies of benzene bonded to either one or three metal atoms within a cluster, is the ease with which migration over the cluster surface may occur. In recent work we have demonstrated [ 75 ] that for the system Ru6C (CO )12 (C6Hg) all possible isomeric forms exist with the benzene Onded to the apical ruthenium atom in the Ru6C core, to the basal atom or on a face. The fact that all three forms may be isolated indicates a moderate barrier, at least, to migration [ 75 ] . In related work on the bis-benzene derivatives, based on the RuBC central unit, similar observations have been made. Here again, the arene may adopt almost all possible coordination modes. ss BYG.

Molecular models for ethylene-metal surface chemistry There continues to be much interest in the identification of the chemisorbed species from ethylene on transition-metal surfaces [ 76,77 ] . There is now general agreement that the adsorptions at 3016 and 1496 cm-1 in the room temperature IR spectrum from ethylene chemisorbed on an impregnated Pt/ Si02 catalyst arise from the presence of a n-adsorbed species of type 1 which corresponds to the Chett-Dewar-Duncanaon bonding mode established for Zeise's salt K[PtC13(C2H4)] H20. Other strong adsorptions at 2880 and 1342 cm-1 are presumed to be from surface ethylidene species (CH3-C)Pt3 type 2. This assignment followed from the pioneering work of Ibach and Lehwald, Somorjai, Demuth and finally Skinner et al. [32,34,58,78] who by comparison of the EEL spectra with the infrared spectrum of the model cluster compound [ Co3 ( CO ) 9 (#3-CCH3 ) ], very successfully reinterpreted the spectra and offspecular features in the original EEL spectra. The ethylidene species has proved to be a very stable species which has been found to occur over an appropriate temperature range on all close-packed fcc [ 111 ] plane studied. It has been suggested that the generation of the ethylidene species from di-Q or 7c-bonded ethylene occurs by the following reaction sequence: surface CHZ = CH2 -> C = CHZ + H (8d.) -+CCH3 Certainly this parallels the behaviour shown by the CH2=CHZ species bonded on trinuclear cobalt or osmium systems. However, it should be pointed BYG. Johnson et al. J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 51-69 67 out that although ethylidene species have also been found bonded to a square of metal atoms in a metal cluster compound [ 78 ], there is no evidence for such a species on fcc [ 100 ] faces. The di-Q species which is closely related to the n-bonded systems has also been characterised as a potential surface bonded entity. Support for this arrangement follows from a comparison with the infrared spectrum of such a ligand in the metal cluster compound (Cgf14) Os2 (CO) a which is known to have this type of structure. Conclusion In this review article we have attempted to present a critical view of the use of molecular clusters as models of metallic catalysts and as means of modelling chemistry at the surface. We have recognised the major problems that still exist in the identification of surface adsorbed species and, more particularly, the bonding modes they adopt on reaction with the variety of different metal faces available on the surface of close-packed metal arrays. It is important to remember the limitations placed on any direct comparisons because of the relatively small size of clusters under examination and, in general, the nonplanar characteristics. Nevertheless, we feel that the use of molecular clusters in this way has led to a much clearer understanding of the bonding mode adopted by a variety of chemisorbed species and, in several instances, has provided the answer to problems of long standing.

        "dc:description": "A critical view of the use of molecular clusters as models of metallic catalysts and as means of modelling chemistry at the surface is presented. The major problems that still exist in the identification of surface adsorbed species and the bonding modes they adopt on reaction with the variety of different metal faces available on the surface of close-packed metal arrays are identified. Limitations have been placed on any direct comparisons because of the relatively small size of clusters under examination and the non-planar characteristics. The use of molecular clusters in this way has led to a much clearer understanding of the bonding mode adopted by a variety of chemisorbed species and can provide answers to long-standing problems.",
