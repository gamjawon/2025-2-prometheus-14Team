Kevwords: Cyanoethylation; Acrylonitrile; Methanol; Solid base catalyst 1. Introduction Acrylonitrile undergoes cyanoethylation with a variety of compounds containing an active hydrogen to form nitriles of different types. The resulting nitriles can be converted to different types of carboxylic acids by hydrolysis, and amines by reduction. Therefore, cyanoethylation is one of the important reactions for the synthesis of drug intermediates and organic com- pounds of industrial interest. In general, cyanoethyla- tion proceeds in the presence of base [ 1]. The catalysts so far reported for cyanoethylation of alcohols are alkali hydroxides [1], alkali alkoxides [2], and tetra- alkylammonium hydroxides [2,3] as homogeneous catalysts, and anion exchange resins as heterogeneous catalysts [4-6]. Although there are many types of metal oxides showing basic properties on the surfaces, and the use of metal oxides has many advantages as compared with the ion exchange resins, there have been no reports of the metal oxides used for cyano- ethylation. In the present letter, we report that cyanoethylation of methanol with acrylonitrile to 3-methoxypropane- nitrile (3-methoxypropiononitrile) proceeds at 323 K by use of metal oxide type solid base catalysts such as alkaline earth oxides and hydroxides, and alumina supported potassium fluoride and hydroxide.

Alkaline earth hydroxides and carbonates used for the catalysts and starting materials for alkaline earth oxides were commercially available. Ca(OH)2, Sr(OH)2.8H2O, Ba(OH)2.8H2O, CaCO3, SrCO3, and BaCO3 were purchased from Kanto Chem., Mg(OH)z and MgCO3 were purchased from E. Merck and Wako Pure Chem., respectively. Alkaline earth oxides, MgO, CaO, SrO, and BaO, were prepared by decomposition of Mg(OH)2, Ca(OH)z, SrCO3, and BaCO3, respectively, at elevated temperatures in a vacuum. LazO3 was prepared from La(OH)3 which was pre- pared from an aqueous solution of La(NO3)3 by hydrolysis with an aqueous ammonia, followed by washing with distilled water and drying at 373 K. ZrO2 and ZnO were prepared from Zr(OH)~ and Zn(OH)2, respectively, by decomposition at elevated temperatures in a vacuum. KF/alumina was purchased from Fluka Chem., the content of KF was 5.5 mmol g 1. Alumina used for the catalyst and the support for KOH/alumina was supplied from the Catalysis Society of Japan (JRC-AL04), KOH/ alumina was prepared by impregnation of the alumina with an aqueous solution of KOH, the content of KOH was 3.6 mmol g-l. The reaction was carried out in an H-shaped glass batch reactor. The two branches of the reactor were separated by a breakable seal. A sample of the catalyst precursor was placed in one branch, outgassed at an elevated temperature for 2 h, and sealed. A mixture of purified acrylonitrile (4 mmol) and methanol (12 mmol) was stored in the other branch until it was introduced through the breakable seal by distilla- tion into the branch containing the catalyst thermo- stated at liquid nitrogen temperature. Reaction was initiated by melting the reactant mixture at a reaction temperature followed by stirring. The products were analyzed by GC with a TC-5 capillary column. 3. Results and discussion The conversions of acrylonitrile are listed in Table 1 when the reaction was carried out for 120 rain over different types of solid base catalysts at a reaction temperature of 323 K.

H. Kabashima, H. Hattori/Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) L33-L35 L35 areas of the catalysts are also included. The products consisted exclusively of 3-methoxypropanenitrile. The selectivity for cyanoetbylation was higher than 99% for all the active catalysts. All the alkaline earth oxides exhibited high con- versions, The conversions obtained with MgO, CaO, and SrO exceeded 90%. Even with BaO which has a small surface area of 2 m2 g i, a conversion of 78.2% was obtained. The alkaline earth hydroxides also exhibited high conversions. The surface areas are smaller for the hydroxides than for the oxides with all the alkaline earth elements. Considering the small surface areas of alkaline earth hydroxides, the activ- ities of the alkaline earth hydroxides appear to be comparable to those of the alkaline earth oxides on the unit surface area basis. The alkaline earth carbonates, however, were inactive except for MgCO3 which showed only a low conversion of 1.3%. Although La203, ZrOz, and ZnO show basic proper- ties and catalyze a number of base-catalyzed reactions [7], they are not so active as the alkaline earth oxides or hydroxides for cyanoethylation of methanol with acrylonitrile; La203 gave a conversion of 8.1%, and ZrO2 and ZnO were inactive. Alumina itself was inactive, but KF/alumina and KOH/alumina exhibited high conversions. The con- versions were not so high as those observed for MgO, Ca(), and SrO, but comparable to those for alkaline earth hydroxides and BaO. The catalytic behaviors of solid base catalysts examined in this study for cyanoethylation are differ- ent in the sensitivity to poisons from those for other base-catalyzed reactions [7] such as l-butene isomer- ization, CH4-D2 exchange and 1,3-butadiene hydro- genation. For these reactions, the active sites are eliminated if the pretreated catalysts are exposed to air, because water and carbon dioxide in air are strongly adsorbed on the active sites. However, for the cyanoethylation of methanol over MgO, the activ- ity was hardly decreased by exposure to air. The conversions of acrylonitrile at different reaction times over the pretreated MgO are compared with those Table 2 Effect of exposure of MgO to air on activity for cyanoethylation of methanol Time Conversion (%) (rain) MgOa MgO-airb 0 0 0 1 2.2 0.9 5 26.6 9.4 10 35.5 22.O 30 85.2 75.S 120 98.7 98.

In the initial stage of the reaction, a short induction period for the MgO exposed to air was observed. The conversion rate accelerated with the reaction time and approached those for the pretreated MgO in 10 rain, A high sensitivity of solid base catalysts to poiso- nous molecules of water and carbon dioxide has prevented the solid base catalysts from being used in a practical process. For cyanoethylation of metha- nol, however, the solid base catalysts are tolerant to water and carbon dioxide, which enables the solid base catalysts to be used in a practical process.
