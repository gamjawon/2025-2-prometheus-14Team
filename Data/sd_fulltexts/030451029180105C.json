Bond and Rosiyah Yahya* Department of Chemistry, Brunel University, Uxbridge UB8 3PH (U.K.) (Received January 2, 1991; accepted February 6, 1991) Abstract The addition of the oxides of Ca, Sc and Ti to a Ru/Si02 catalyst increases its activity for n-butane hydrogenolysis to an extent which depends on the type of pretreatment applied; product selectivities and turnover frequencies are essentially unchanged. Adding the oxides of V, Cr and Mn, which are partially reduced under reaction conditions, leads to decreases in rate which are much more marked after high-temperature reduction (HTR; 758 K) than after low-temperature reduction (LTR; 433 K), but only modest changes in product selectivities are seen; the effectiveness in deactivation decreases with increasing atomic number. Activation energies decrease progressively with increasing modifier concentration. Numerous variables in catalyst composition, preparation and pretreatment affect the extent of interaction between modifier and metal. Failure to detect an SMSI-like effect with Ti02 is attributed to the use of a low Ti:Ru ratio (0.25). The addition of V oxide can lead to either selective or non-selective deactivation, significant changes in product selectivities occurring only in the former case. The non-selective mode was the main one in the present work. Introduction Inspection of the literature of heterogeneous catalysis reveals that enormous efforts have been devoted to the promotion, modification or selective poisoning of metallic catalysts. The objectives of this work fall into three classes [ 1 ] . First, there is the desire to achieve greater strength and mechanical stability for catalyst particles by the incorporation of structural promoters; secondly, there is the wish to enhance a catalyst's activity by including one or more electronic promoters; and, thirdly, there is the need to improve a catalyst's selectivity towards the desired product(s) by adding a selective poison which will eliminate or at least minimise the unwanted side-reactions. This last category embraces a large and complex collection of phenomena, *Present address: Pusat Asasi Sains, Universiti Malaya, 59100 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 0304-5102/91/$3.50 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 76 including, for example, the use of basic additives to direct the syngas reaction on Pd towards methanol formation [2], and the incorporation of Re, Ir or Sn in a Pt/A1203 petroleum reforming catalyst to depress or change the mode of carbon deposition [3]. Modification of an active metal's behaviour is therefore achieved through either (i) alloying with a similar (usually inactive) metal with which there is limited if not complete mutual solubility, or (ii) using a basic additive from Groups IA to IIIA, where reduction to the zerovalent state is unlikely, or (iii) combining the active element with another with which no alloying in the bulk is possible (e.g. Ru-Cu), or (iv) employing an oxide of a transition series metal (e.g. Mo03, Ti02 or VZO5) where the oxidation state of the additive in the working catalyst is uncertain. In cases (ii) and (iv) the modifier may be used as the support, and in case (iv) the phenomena encountered are attributed to Strong Metal-Support Interaction (SMSI) [ 4 ]. In the large number of books, reviews and papers devoted to this general theme, it is difficult to discern any trends that apply universally. Most studies relate to a small aspect of the whole, and it is difficult to know whether an effect shown in one system will apply in another. There is certainly no general theory of modifiers or additives. What is sure is that the type and the magnitude of the effect will depend inter alia on the catalytic metal, its support and the method of its preparation, and its particle size; on the type of modifier, and whether it is the support or a third component; and on the reaction employed to examine the effect. While it seems that the chief way in which a change in behaviour arises is through an alteration of the mean size of the active ensemble, electronic modification of the active atoms has always been considered possible and totally new types of site may sometimes be created [5]. Because of the fragmentary nature of much of the previously published work, we thought it would be of interest to try to assess the importance of the chemical nature of the modifier by adding various transition series oxides to a single supported metal. In this paper we examine how adding oxides of each of the first row transition metals (Ca ... Mn) to a Ru/Si02 catalyst affects its behaviour in the hydrogenolysis of n-butane. We have chosen this approach, rather than employing the oxides themselves as supports, because we feared that if we did we would alter the size, morphology and form of attachment of the particles to the support. We are hopeful that, by retaining the active metal and support as a constant factor, we should avoid some of the uncertainties which would otherwise arise. Si02 was chosen as the support, since the evidence as far as it goes suggests that additives will interact less strongly with it than with other alternatives, and that migration of moieties of the additive over the support to the metal will therefore be facile. For a first series of catalysts, an M:Ru atomic ratio (M =modifying element) of 0.25 was chosen on the basis that we might expect the Ru/Si02 catalyst to have a dispersion of about 0.5 and that we wanted a maximum coverage of the surface of 0.5. In a second series of catalysts, prepared slightly differently, higher M:Ru ratios were used. 77 Experimental PrOaration of catalysts Two series of catalysts were prepared. For the first, 1% Ru/SiOz was made by impregnating Degussa Aerosil 200 to incipient wetness with a solution of RuC13-xH20 (O Ru, 42:07: on loan from Johnson Matthey Technology Centre) and drying (400 K overnight) An aqueous solution of each modifier was then applied to a portion of this precursor, which after vacuum drying (340 K, 16 h) was calcined in air (748 K, 16 h). For the second series, 0.5ss'o Ru/Si02 was prepared by impregnating the same Si02 with an aqueous solution of [Ru(NH3)s]C13 (also on loan from Johnson Matthey Technology Centre), and, after drying, calcining in air (673 K, 16 h). Solutions of the modifiers were then applied as before, and precursors were finally calcined at 673 K (16 h). Compounds used as sources of the modifiers were: Ca(OH)2 (BDH Chemicals); Sc(NO3)3-4H20 (Johnson Matthey); Ti(O'Pr)4 (Aldrich Chemicals Co.); (NH4)Z[VO(C204)Z]-2H20, prepared from NH4V03 and (NH4)ZC204; (NH4)ZCr207 (Fisons); and Mn(OAc)Z - 4H20 (BDH Chemicals). TGA measurements confirmed that all of these compounds decomposed to the corresponding oxides below 673 K. In the first series, the atomic ratio of the modifying element to Ru was 0.25; in the second series it was either 0.5 or 1.0. Ru/Si02 catalysts without modifiers were prepared similarly. Catalyst characterisation Temperature-programmed reductions (TPRs) were performed on all the calcined precursors, using 5% HZ in Ar as reductant (40 cm3 min-1) and a heating rate of 5 K min-1. . HZ chemisorption isotherms were obtained at room temperature for all members of the first series,, following the pretreatments used before the catalytic measurements (see below). Samples (0.5 to 1 g) were heated under vacuum at 10 K min-1 to 573 K and evacuated for 1 h before. admission of HZ doses. Catalytic measurements The apparatus used has been described before [6]. Each. sample of catalyst (~ 0.2 g) was activated by reduction in HZ at 758 K for 16 h (HTR1); after measuring activity, it was oxidised in air (623 K, 1 h) and reduced in H3 (433 K, 1 h: LTR); after further measurements of activity, there was a final reduction, as for the first (HTR2). H2 flow-rates were 30 crrc3 min-1; air flowrate was 20 cm' min-1. For reductions, temperatures were raised at 5 K min-1, and for oxidation at 10 K min-1. Hydrogenolysis of n-butane (Argo International) was carried out in a continuous-flow mode at atmospheric pressure, using Hz (100 cm3 min-1), n-butane (10 cm3 min-1.) and Nz (30 cm' min-1); the latter was purified by passage through an Mn0/SiOz trap. Products were separated on a 3ss'o squalane/ 78 A1203 column at 363 K. Measurements were made in a single rising-temperature stage, comprising 20-min isothermal steps, samples being taken for analysis 18 min after each new temperature was attained. Conversions below 0.0196 were detectable, but product analyses only became reliable above - 0.0296 conversion. Temperature ranges were selected to give conversions in the range 0.05 to 596. Arrhenius.plots based on reactant removal were linear in the ranges specified in the tables (R > 0.995). Rates are expressed as mmol gR ' h ', and a rate of 100 in these units equates to a conversion of 0.8596 for 196 Ru/Si02. Product selectivities are defined as follows. If cj is the number of moles of product containing j carbon atoms, the number of moles of n-butane reacted A is given by: A = (cl + 2c2 + 3c3) /4 and the selectivity S; for that product is: Sj = c; /A. Thus: S1+2S2+3S3=4 and it is necessary to quote S2 and S3 to define the product composition. Results Temperature-programmed reduction A major problem in using oxide-modified supported metals is to decide the state of reduction of the modifier in the working catalyst. TPR measurements should contribute to our understanding of this question, even if definitive answers cannot be obtained. With the first series of catalysts, in which the atomic M:Ru ratio (M =modifying element) is only 0.25, the additional HZ uptake due to a possible partial or complete reduction of the modifier is quite small. If H spillover operates, i.e. if after reduction of Ru02 to Ru(0) there are mobile H atoms which can reduce the oxide modifier, the peaks due to formation of RU(0) and to modifier reduction may not be distinguishable. Only if a significant part of the modifier oxide is not reduced by H spillover may a separate peak at high temperature be seen. Table 1 records the observed values of Tn,., and of the 9'o reductions of the catalysts of the first series. For those containing either no modifier, or CaO, SC203 or Ti02, the reduction based on Ru02 to Ru(0) is very close to 10096, suggesting that these three modifiers are not reduced, at least below 773 K. Values of Tm,,, are also very similar (- 415 K). Some distinct effects are however seen when the oxides of V, Cr and Mn are present. HZ uptakes are higher (Table 1): remembering that, for a lowering of oxidation number of the modifier by one, the apparent degree of reduction will be increased by - 6% (i.e. 2596/4), the results taken with chemical common 79 TABLE 1 Temperature-programmed reduction of modified Ru/Si02 catalysts 96 Ru Modifier M:RU T,' 9b reduction 4b reduction (K) of Ru3+ of M 1 - - 390(s), 417 104 - 1 Ca 0.25 412 102 - 1 Sc 0.25 413 99 - 1 Ti 0.25 415 101 - 1 V 0.25 437 110 - 1 Cr 0.25 394, 711 107 - 1 Mn 0.25 408, 441 117 - 0.5 V 0.5 431, 680, 744 95 30 0.5 V 1.0 445, 792, 744 97 29 0.5 Cr 0.5 441, 704 100 116` 0.5 Mn 0.5 435, 559 80 174d 'T , values for peaks due to reduction of modifier are italicised.

Temperature-programmed reduction of second series of catalysts, based on 0.5% Ru/ Si02- (A) no modifier; (B) Cr:Ru=0.5; (C) Mn:Ru=0.5; (D) V:Ru=0.5; (E) V:Ru=1.0. sense suggest that final oxidation states are V(III), Cr(II) and Mn(II). When V20r, is present, the value of T . is raised by t 20 K; when Cr203 is present, there is a substantial high-temperature shoulder at - 435 K and a small peak at - 710 K, and when Mn02 is present the single peak is split into two approximately equal components. The course of events is somewhat easier to discern when the M:Ru ratio is higher, as in the second series of catalysts. Here (see Table 1 and Fig. 1) the T ,., for the reduction of RuOz is almost the same (430-445 K) and a little higher than before, the degrees of reduction being close to 100% except when Mn02 is present. However, in each case where a modifier is 80 included, there is a more or less distinct reduction event at higher temperature, presumably caused by the reduction of a separate -oxide phase too far from metal particles to be subject to a hydrogen spillover effect. The sizes of these peaks suggest that only about 306 of the V(V) is reduced to V(III), that all the Cr(III) is reduced to Cr(II) and that all the Mn(IV) is reduced to at least Mn(II) and possibly to an even lower oxidation state (Table 1). TPR measurements therefore provide some indications as to the degree of reduction of the modifiers under working conditions. There have been a number of previous studies [7-9] of the reduction of dried or calcined Ru precursors, but variations in procedures and conditions, both for their preparation and their reduction, make comparisons difficult and of limited value. HZ chemisorption isothernLs Interpretation of H2 chemisorption isotherms is subject to uncertainty when reduced modifiers -are present, as these may adsorb H2 in addition to that taken up by RU(0) particles; either directly or via H spillover. Indications of trouble may be shown either by the magnitude of the volumes adsorbed or by the general shapes of the isotherms. Values of the H/Ru ratio obtained by extrapolating to zero pressure the isotherms measured on the first series of catalysts after each pretreatment are given in Tables 2-4; they are generally low ( < 8%) and so provide no positive evidence for the occurrence of spillover. It is however noticeable that uptakes after HTR1 and HTR2 are greater when the non-interacting modifiers (Ca, Sc, Ti) are present; they appear to be able to counteract the effect which otherwise operates during either the high-temperature reduction or the evacuation. Their action is also reflected in the shape of the relevant isotherms (Fig. 2), which show longer linear regions of lower slope when the modifiers are present. However in the presence of a strongly-interacting modifier such as Mn, which suppresses H2 chemisorption, the shapes of the isotherms reflect the interference (Fig. 2). No H2 uptake could be measured after HTR of the V-containing catalyst. We have found considerably higher dispersions when the precursor is first reduced without prior calcination, in agreement with our earlier work [10] and the literature [11]. Catalytic rate measurts on the first series Tables 2, 3 and 4 contain the Arrhenius parameters, and the rates, turnover frequencies (TOFs) and- product selectivities measured at 433 K, for each of the seven catalysts of the first series, after each of the three pretreatments. We expected that the first high-temperature reduction (HTR1) would encourage the interaction of the modifiers :with the RU(0) particles, by analogy with the SMSI effect. The oxidation preceding the LTR should re-oxidise the reduced modifiers, and LTR might produce Ru(0) particles .free -of modifying effects. Finally the second HTR (HTR2) should restore the original interaction.

HZ chemisorption isotherms on 196 Ru/Si02 catalysts: (A) no modifier; (B) Sc-modified; (C) Mn-modified: (O) HTRl; (O) LTR; (0) HTR2. Table 2 shows, somewhat surprisingly, that rates following HTRI are increased by the presence of Ca, Se and Ti, but these changes are largely accounted for by the higher values for the areas of active surface, since TOFs vary by less than two-fold. However, V, Cr and Mn have much larger effects, decreasing with increasing atomic number. The very low rate found when V is present may be partly due to a very small active area, i.e. the Ru(0) particles may be largely covered by VIII) species, but with Cr and Mn the TOF values are only a factor of 10 smaller than those found with the non-interacting modifiers. This may simply reflect the large size of the active centre required for hydrogenolysis. Activation energies are distinctly lower when interacting modifiers are present than in their absence. Oxidation and LTR increase the rates with all catalysts, by factors of 2 to 4.5 for those not containing the strongly-interacting modifiers (see Table 3). However, the rates and TOFs for those containing V, Cr and Mn are lower (especially for V) than for Ru/Si02, showing that there is still some interference between the metal and the modifier even after this mild reduction. Activation energies after LTR are remarkably constant (121 t6 kJ mol-I). The effect of HTR2 (Table 4) is to give rates and TOFs that are about three times smaller than after HTRl, the H/Ru ratios being not very different. The effects are even greater with V and Cr, but not with Mn, where the increase in TOF is probably more apparent than real. Activation energies are again lower where interaction is apparent. 84 Catalytic rate measurements on the second series In order to explore the foregoing effects further, a second series of catalysts was prepared as described in the Experimental section, based on 0.5% Ru/Si02 prepared from [Ru(NH3)s]C13 and having M:Ru ratios of either 0.5 or unity, i.e. higher than for the first series; only V, Cr and Mn were used as modifiers. The results obtained are shown in Table 5. After HTR1, all the modified catalysts were less active than the unmodified Ru/Si02 by at least a factor of 6, with Mn being most effective in lowering the rate. Increasing the V:Ru ratio from 0.5 to unity led to a further decrease in activity, and there was a progressive decrease in activation energy. After oxidation and LTR, the modified catalysts all showed rates between 30 and 100 mmol gR -1 h-1 at 433 K, compared to that shown by the unmodified Ru/Si02 of 450 mmol gRu-1 h-1. Activation energies were however almost constant (113 t 9 kJ mol-1). This confirms the findings with the first series, namely, that oxidation and LTR does not completely abolish the interaction which took place during HTRl, although all the rates are increased (including that for Ru/Si02 itself), with the Mn-modified catalyst being accelerated by a factor of more than 103. With these higher M:Ru ratios, the four modified catalysts failed to show any significant activity after HTR2; only the Ru/Si02 then exhibited a measurable rate. Product selectivities for the first series Although helpful information is provided by the effect of modifier and pretreatment on rates and Arrhenius parameters, more subtle influences on the structure and composition of the active centre are revealed by examining product selectivities. First we look at their values at a single fixed temperature; later we shall comment on their temperature variation. We have often interpreted the selectivities in terms of a general mechanistic scheme due originally to Kempling and Anderson [ 12 ]; this is shown below. Steady-state analysis of this scheme leads to equations relating product selectivities, defined as above, to conversion for any particular set of values of the rate constants. For convenience these are grouped as: Tj = kj' /(kj' + kj*) and at low conversion ( < 10%) the equations reduce to: S2/T2 =1 +F-S3 and T3 =S3 /(1-F'). There are insufficient known quantities to permit unambiguous solution of these equations, so, following former practice, we assume T2 to be unity, an assumption which has been shown [10] to be reasonably valid. Cases where it is not are readily apparent. The parameters based on this assumption are denoted by primes.

One very clear feature of the results shown in Tables 2-4 is that the selectivity parameters are almost unaffected by the presence of Ca, Sc or Ti, for any of the pretreatments; F' is 0.22-0.24 in all cases, while T3' is somewhat higher after the LTR (0.58-0.63) than after the HTRs (0.46-0.55). These small differences are perhaps not surprising in view of the small changes in rate, but the Mn-modified catalysts show similar values even when (as after HTRl) the rate is much depressed. By contrast, however, the parameters shown by the V- and Cr-modified catalysts are significantly different from the others, although there is no consistency in the variations. By comparison with the unmodified Ru/Si02, the presence of V increases F' after HTRl and LTR, but T3' is respectively decreased and increased. The effect of Cr is to decrease F' after HTR1 and LTR, while T3' is either decreased (after HTRl) or remains unchanged (after LTR). Less complete statements can be made about the behaviour of the second series of catalysts (Table 5), because of the often very low activities. After HTRl, V (at V:Ru=0.5) produces changes in selectivity parameters in the same sense as noted above, but after LTR there are only somewhat minor variations in F' and T3'. This is perhaps not unexpected, since although the rates are only suppressed by factors of 5 to 15, the much greater changes in the parameters found with V in the first series (Table 3) were accompanied by a rate decreased by a factor of 175. We must also note that the changes in the selectivity parameters found in this work are generally less than those we have seen with V-modified Ru/ Si02 catalysts prepared in a different way [ 131. It is quite evident that the extent of the effects produced by the modifying agent depend substantially on the manner of preparing the catalysts, and that the M:Ru ratio by itself is no sure guide to the degree of interaction between the components. This point will be considered further in the Discussion. The variation of product selectivities with temperature is similar for all catalysts, when allowance is made for the different temperature ranges that had necessarily to be used. At low temperatures ( < 400 K) the reaction is primarily that of a single bond breaking; S, increases and S3 decreases as temperature is raised, due to progressive multiple fission, and SZ either increases, decreases or passes through a maximum depending on the temperature range used. Figure 3 shows the results obtained with the V-modified catalyst after each pretreatment, to illustrate the observed changes. At low temperatures, where the assumption that TZ is unity is reasonable, values of F' are approximately constant, while those of T3' decrease with rising temperature. We have previously shown [ 141 that a plot of ln(T3-1-1) vs. 87 4 HTR1 LTR jLIR2 3 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 '` - 2 0 t , - ~,e.c-o.a,s 3 450 500 550 450 500 500 550 600 T/K T/K T/K Fig. 3.

The numbers give the number of C atoms in the products. reciprocal temperature gives AE3, the activation energy difference between desorption and further cracking of the C3* intermediate. As will be apparent from Fig. 3, AE3 is lower after LTR than after the HTRs. This was observed in all cases where measurements were possible, irrespective of which modifier was present: values of DE3 were as follows: HTR1, 81-104 (mean 96); LTR, 51-74 (mean 63); and HTR2, 99-110 (mean 105) kJ mol-1. Discussion Non-interacting modifiers It is clearly apparent from the results presented above that the oxides of Ca, Sc and Ti have much smaller effects on the dispersion and activity of the Ru/Si02 catalysts than do those of V, Cr and Mn. Their effects however are not negligible, as after the HTRs they raise the H/Ru ratios, improve the linearity of the H2 chemisorption isotherms and increase the activities, so that the TOFs then vary by less than a factor of two; their values after HTRl are however greater than those found after HTR2 by a factor of about two. These modifiers seem not to affect dispersion significantly after LTR (Table 3), although rates are generally faster when Sc is present. What is quite sure is that the non-interacting modifiers produce no changes of great important to the Kempling-Anderson parameters; at 433 K, mean values of F' are 0.22-0.24 and of T3' - 0.50 after the HTRs and ^- 0.60 after LTR. These modifiers seem to have little effect, either steric or electronic, on the active centres on the Ru particles, and the term `non-interacting modifier' is therefore applied to them. Although Si02 is incapable of reduction at the temperatures used for pretreatment of catalysts in our work, there are nevertheless changes in 88 activity as well as in dispersion to which variations in pretreatment give rise. In our earlier work with 0.5% Ru/Si02 catalysts [ 10 ], these partially compensated to give TOFs varying less than three-fold. Here with 1% Ru/Si0z the compensation is less complete (see Tables 2-4) and the values of the TOFs are generally larger. Since TOFs are sometimes themselves dependent on particle size [ 15 ], as is reasonable when the test reaction is structuresensitive, these results may not be incompatible, but at this stage it may be better to focus on how the variables of preparation and pretreatment affect dispersion and rate per gR separately. So many uncertainties surround the TOF concept [10] that it is unwise to rely on it alone as a guide to the interpretation of our results. In this connection it is informative to plot the Arrhenius parameters found for Ru/Si02 catalysts in this work and in our other publications [10, 13, 14] as a compensation effect (Fig. 4). What is noticeable is that all the LTR points lie about the upper line, corresponding to a high activity state, and all the HTR2 points about the lower line, associated with a low activity state, while those for HTRl are randomly distributed between the two. It appears that activities after HTR 1 depend quixotically on the precise conditions of preparation and activation, but, once metal particles have been formed, the subsequent transitions brought about by reductive or oxidative treatments are more limited in scope. It is facile to ascribe these different activity states 5(1 GS Q c 40 30' 90 100 110 120 130 140150 E/ W mol-' Fig. 4.

Open symbols, HTRl; hatched, hTR; half-filled, HTR2. 89 to morphological factors, but one other possible factor deserves mention: there is now evidence to show that PdSi intermetallic phases can be formed on HTR of Pd/Si02 [ 161, and this may also explain the low activity state of HTR Ru/Si02. The effects of Ca and Sc on HZ chemisorption and on catalytic activity may trace their origin to the formation of mixed oxides (e.g. CaRu03) in the calcination; compounds of RU02 and alkaline earth oxides having the perovskite structure are of course well-known [171. On performing HTR1, Ru(0) particles differing from those formed in the absence of modifiers may be formed. These oxides may also serve to neutralise the acidity of the Si02 surface and to remove Cl- from the metal, but when all is said and done, their effect is small; this may be due both to their strong interactions with the Si02 and to their difficulty of reduction (see Table 1). We cannot however tell what fractions of the modifiers interact with the metal, and therefore cannot decide which factor is the more important. The failure of Ti02 to show any greater effect is at first sight surprising. Previously [ 101 we had shown that with a very similar catalyst the inclusion of Ti02 resulted in a partially reversible SMSI; in this case however a high Ti:Ru ratio was used (-6:1 atomic). We may suppose that, at the ratio of 0.25 used in the present work, much of the Ti02 remains affixed to the Si02 surface. At the higher ratio, this may become saturated with a monolayer of Ti02 species, while still leaving some free to interact with the metal. Interacting modifiers In contrast to the oxides of Ca, Sc and Ti, those of V, Cr and Mn all produce greater or lesser effects on the 1% Ru/Si02 catalyst (Tables 2-4): the largest are upon the rates and the Arrhenius parameters observed after the HTRs, with smaller effects after LTR, and on product selectivities. First, as to the rates and Arrhenius parameters: after each pretreatment, the V, Cr and Mn modifiers all lead to decreases in rate, the size of the effect becoming smaller as the atomic number rises, and being greatest after the HTRs. What is unusual is that the slower rates are associated with lower activation energies; the decrease in the pre-exponential term is clearly the dominant factor, and this presumably reflects the smaller number of active centres, as is at least partly supported by our HZ chemisorption results. However, HTR is not a necessary precondition, since even after LTR the rates are lower (especially with V, where the rate is depressed by a factor of about 200) without there being a change in the activation energy. Analogous results, but with even lower activation ene ies, were obtained with the second series of catalysts (Table 5), although here Mn appears as the most effective modifier; no rates could however be recorded with any of the catalysts after HTR2. Presumably the RU(0) particles are then totally encapsulated by the modifying oxides, this being possible only if HTR is performed on materials where Ru is already in the metallic state. Addition of the modifiers also leads to decreased rates after LTR, which except in the case of the V-containing catalysts is more marked than in the first series. 90 Values of H/Ru are generally < 0.01 in the presence of the interacting modifiers (- 0.04 for Cr and Mn after LTR), but these low values do not account for the small rates, and TOFs are. correspondingly low. It is of interest to see whether the effect of the modifiers on activation energies conforms to a compensation effect; the Arrhenius parameters are so plotted in Fig. 5, where the two principal lines are exactly those shown in Fig. 4 for the plain Ru/Si0z catalysts. These adequately describe respectively the first series LTR data points, and many of the HTR points in both series. LTR data points for the second series occupy an intermediate position, and only those systems showing very low rates lie well clear of the lower line. Although this analysis is not entirely clear-cut, it would seem that the observed rate phenomena can be classified into two or at most three basic ranges of activity, each perhaps corresponding to a distinct configuration of active centre [ 181. Of course, the lines in Figs. 4 and 5 are far from being isoactivity lines; the rate difference between the top and bottom points in Fig. 5 is - 103. The behaviour of V oxide as a modifier of Ru/Si02 has been studied previously, using catalysts prepared in a somewhat different manner [ 131. V205 was first applied to the Si02 by impregnation with the oxalate complex, followed by calcination; this was expected to give microcrystals of V205 on the support. RuC13 was then added by impregnation, and the usual sequence of pretreatments started. Rates after HTR1 decreased progressively with increasing V:Ru ratio, and this was accompanied by marked increases in 50 40 30 a c 20 10 1 - - - __-] 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 E/kl mol-' Fig. 5.

Open symbols, HTRl; hatched, LTR; half-filled, HTR2. 91 both F' and T3' such as are not seen here. We also note that much higher activities [ 10, 13 ] and dispersions [ 10, 11 ] are found if the RuC13 is not calcined before the first reduction: the two do not however compensate, and higher values of TOF are found with calcined precursors. It is possible to imagine several different modes of deactivation by the modifier. In a selective mode, certain classes of site on all particles are eliminated through blocking by Mx+ or MO., species, as in the case of an SMSI; a change in product selectivities is then explicable, and this is what we think happened in our previous work [ 13 ]. Similar effects have been found when Group IVB elements were incorporated into Ru/A1203 catalysts [19]. Alternatively, the surface of particles of all sizes may be covered nonselectively, so that no change in product selectivities is to be expected. Finally, small particles may be coated in preference to large ones; this will cause a change in product selectivities to be seen only if a structure-sensitivity factor is at work, such as we have seen with Ru/A1203 catalysts [15]. The changes in F' and T3' seen in this work with V-modified catalysts are in the same sense as those seen before [13], but are very much smaller. From this we conclude that here the mode of deactivation is mainly, but not quite entirely, the non-selective one. It now remains to speculate on why in this work the F' and T3' parameters change so little, i.e. why the deactivation is largely non-selective and why previously [ 13 ] it was found to be selective. The reason may lie in the different catalyst pretreatments and resulting activities. As noted above, direct HTR of RuC13 gives high rates and selective modification; prior calcination to Ru02 before reduction gives smaller rates and non-selective modification. Larger particles may present a more uniform appearance if most of the surface comprises low-index planes, and the scope for selective modification is therefore limited. Smaller particles having a larger fraction of low-coordinate surface atoms will the more readily exhibit the effects of selective modification. An explanation for the marked decreases in activation energy found in the present work after HTRs has not yet been attempted; in the earlier work [ 13 ], changes were in the same sense but much smaller. There are a number of possible explanations, some of which are trivial. First of all, low activation energies may be caused by deactivation due to carbon deposition, although Ru catalysts do not normally suffer much in this respect. Secondly, since they are associated with non-selective coating of the Ru(0) particles and with a `low-activity' state (see Fig. 5), they may result from somewhat weaklyadsorbed intermediates, formed on heavily modified surfaces, desorbing easily as temperature is raised. Cr and Mn oxides are in general less effective modifiers than V oxide, although this depends upon the M:Ru ratio and the pretreatment. As the number of d-electrons increases, there may be a stronger interaction with the Si02 surface or a lower tendency to interact with the Ru(0) particles. We note however that the effect of Mn in changing the characteristics of Fe catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis has been attributed to an SMSI [20]; Cr is mentioned in the literature as an additive to Pt petroleum reforming 92 catalysts [21 ] and has been used as a modifier in basic studies [22]. It may be significant that several of the values of F' for Cr-modified catalysts are lower than those for the unmodified ones, although T3' can change in either direction. The deactivation mode for Mn appears to be almost entirely nonselective. Conclusions Under the conditions used in this work, significant inhibition of the rate of n-butane hydrogenolysis catalysed by Ru/Si02 only occurs when the oxides of V, Cr and Mn axe present; even they give rise to only small changes in product selectivities (i.e. the inhibition is non-selective), although activation energies are lowered. The inability of the oxides of Ca, Sc and Ti to exert a site-blocking effect may be chiefly due to their lack of mobility over the surface of the Si02 support. The extent and manner of interaction of modifying species with the metal is a complex function of their chemical nature, their concentration, the support, the way in which the components of the catalyst are incorporated, the size of the metal particles, and the pretreatment given to the catalyst.

The addition of the oxides of Ca, Sc and Ti to a Ru/SiO2 catalyst increases its activity for n-butane hydrogenolysis to an extent which depends on the type of pretreatment applied; product selectivities and turnover frequencies are essentially unchanged. Adding the oxides of V, Cr and Mn, which are partially reduced under reaction conditions, leads to decreases in rate which are much more marked after high-temperature reduction (HTR; 758 K) than after low-temperature reduction (LTR; 433 K), but only modest changes in product selectivities are seen; the effectiveness in deactivation decreases with increasing atomic number. Activation energies decrease progressively with increasing modifier concentration. Numerous variables in catalyst composition, preparation and pretreatment affect the extent of interaction between modifier and metal. Failure to detect an SMSI-like effect with TiO2 is attributed to the use of a low Ti:Ru ratio (0.25). The addition of V oxide can lead to either selective or non-selective deactivation, significant changes in product selectivities occurring only in the former case. The non-selective mode was the main one in the present work. References 1 G.C. Bond M.R. Gelsthorpe R.R. Rajaram R. Yahya C. Morterra A. Zecchina G.

        "dc:description": "The addition of the oxides of Ca, Sc and Ti to a Ru/SiO2 catalyst increases its activity for n-butane hydrogenolysis to an extent which depends on the type of pretreatment applied; product selectivities and turnover frequencies are essentially unchanged. Adding the oxides of V, Cr and Mn, which are partially reduced under reaction conditions, leads to decreases in rate which are much more marked after high-temperature reduction (HTR; 758 K) than after low-temperature reduction (LTR; 433 K), but only modest changes in product selectivities are seen; the effectiveness in deactivation decreases with increasing atomic number. Activation energies decrease progressively with increasing modifier concentration. Numerous variables in catalyst composition, preparation and pretreatment affect the extent of interaction between modifier and metal. Failure to detect an SMSI-like effect with TiO2 is attributed to the use of a low Ti:Ru ratio (0.25). The addition of V oxide can lead to either selective or non-selective deactivation, significant changes in product selectivities occurring only in the former case. The non-selective mode was the main one in the present work.",
