PART II. DYNAMIC ADSORPTION/DESORPTION EQUILIBRIA R.SNEL University of Twente, Faculty of Chemical Technology, P.O. Box 217, 7500 AE Enschede (The Netherlands) (Received September 7, 1988; accepted November 7,1988) Summary Results from alkene co-feeding and benzene poisoning experiments indicate that readsorption and secondary reaction of initially produced alkenes is an important pathway leading to the formation of long-chain hydrocarbons during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Synthesis sites are differen- tiated in short-chain and long-chain synthesis sites. Synthesis initiation by readsorbed alkenes on long-chain synthesis sites is favoured by increased reaction pressure and leads to the formation of predominantly long-chain hydrocarbons. When this type of synthesis becomes more pronounced, inflection points are observed in Anderson-Schulz-Flory plots of the product distribution. Secondary reactions are found to be very dependent on dynamic adsorption/desorption equilibria. An example of a mechanism which is consistent with the experimental observations is presented. Introduction In the first paper in this series, we proposed a model to account for the often observed profound influence of the conditions of catalyst pretreat- ment on the selectivity and activity in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [1]. The model is largely based on the hydrogenation strength distribution among the surface sites. In this communication, we wish to account for observed secondary reactions of olefinic primary synthesis products. Elsewhere, we have showed that co-feeding of (10 mol%) ethene results in suppression of methane formation [2] and strongly enhanced hydro- carbon synthesis [3]. In contrast, when co-fed in the same concentrations, propene [4] and butene [5] suppress synthesis activity. In agreement with findings by Dwyer and Somorjai [6], we concluded that readsorption and secondary reaction of the initially produced alkenes is an important pathway leading to the formation of large molar mass hydrocarbons during Fischer- Tropsch synthesis. Secondary reactions of olefinic primary products were 0304-5102/89/$3.60 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 144 shown to include hydrogenation, isomerization, hydrogenolysis, synthesis initiation and probably propagation and alkylation. All these reactions are controlled by dynamic adsorption/desorption equilibria. Almost invariably it is possible to describe the product distribution of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis by Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) statistics, which can be mathematically expressed as: 0n=0,P\"-' where 0n and 0, are the number of moles of a hydrocarbon with carbon number n or ;' respectively, and P is the probability of chain growth. For any given value of P, the product spectrum is fixed. Recently the concept of different sites producing different synthesis products has been introduced [7-10]. In the first paper in this series [I], we made a distinction between methanation sites and synthesis sites. Now we propose a further distinction between the latter in 'short-chain synthesis sites' and 'long-chain synthesis sites', associated with the production of short-chain hydrocarbons and long- chain hydrocarbons respectively. This concept helps explain the often observed [9-14] disparity between the values of P describing the formation of lower and higher mass products in ASF product statistics. The inflection point in ASF plots is not always found at the same carbon number, but differs with different catalysts. Since it has been established that alkenes initiate hydrocarbon synthesis on readsorption, such initiation on 'long-chain sites' will result in much higher P values than initiation on 'short-chain sites'. It stand to reason that the surface life of intermediates on 'long-chain sites' is much longer than on 'short-chain sites' and is associated with a higher heat of adsorption. We therefore suggest a preference for alkene adsorption on such sites, resulting in extra high values for P in the high mass range. In this respect the inflection point is clearly catalyst-dependent. Because short-chain alkenes are the major product in this particular type of synthesis, P refers to the growth probability of this product unless stated otherwise. The proposed concept can be easily verified by some simple experiments. Any preference of alkenes for 'long-chain sites' should be strong in benzene. Since this compound does not initiate synthesis, pulses of benzene will selec- tively poison 'long-chain sites', resulting in a reduced value for P. In preliminary experiments we have shown that this is indeed the case [15]. The mechanisms proposed to date for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis do not appear to account for our experimental observations, and speculation on a mechanism that does accommodate our findings is presented. It is the purpose of this communication to discuss the influence of dynamic adsorption/desorption equilibria on the hydrocarbon synthesis. Experimental Catalyst The catalyst used in this study was prepared by partial combustion of iron citrate complexes [16]. The oxidic catalyst precursor was crushed and 145 screened to particle sizes in the range of 0.2 to 0.6 mm and reduced at a pressure of 300 kPa hydrogen at a flow rate of 1.6 X 10~6 m3 s~1 for 3 - 5 h at 433 K and subsequently for 16 - 20 h at 573 K. An amount of typically 500 mg precursor was used per experiment. Catalyst testing The catalytic behaviour was evaluated in a fixed bed microreactor sys- tem [17] based on a concentric tube design [18]. The product was analyzed by an on-line gas chromatographic data system [19-21]. The reaction conditions employed were 2.0 MPa pressure temperature 543 K and a flow (VHSV = 1000) of synthesis gas with a mol ratio H2/CO = 0.5. Preparation of the benzene-helium mixture A mixture of benzene (1.15 mol%) in helium was prepared using the following procedure. A small stainless steel vessel (0.5 1) containing benzene was immersed in liquid nitrogen until the benzene was frozen. The immersed vessel was then connected to a manifold, linking it to a feed cylinder and a vacuum pump in a high pressure gas mixing-feeding station. Full details of the station are given elsewhere [22]. When a pressure of 1 Pa was reached, a valve in the line to the vacuum pump was closed and the temperature of the benzene was allowed to rise. A valve in the line from the benzene cylinder was then slowly opened, until the absolute pressure in the feed cylinder was 7 kPa (about 65% of the benzene pressure at 293 K), and closed again. Helium was then added, up to a pressure of 609 kPa. The mixture was allowed to stand for 48 h in order to ensure thorough mixing before use. Introduction of benzene dosage At our preselected times, the synthesis gas feed stream was replaced by a helium stream at 300 kPa of the same space velocity, until no hydro- carbons could be detected in the reactor effluent stream. The benzene- helium mixture was then introduced to the catalyst at a rate of 130 cm3 min~1 NTP. When the desired amount of benzene had been passed over the catalyst, the flow was replaced with pure helium. We resumed using synthesis gas as the feed once no trace of benzene could be observed. Results and discussion Effect of benzene treatment on low pressure synthesis Synthesis was carried out at 300 kPa. Table 1 shows the amounts of benzene fed through the catalyst, and the times at which this was done. In line with the expectations, the value of P decreased with each succes- sive benzene dosage and remained constant during synthesis (Fig. 1). In contrast, the rate of hydrocarbon synthesis, rcn, decreased with the first dosage, but no further effect was observed with subsequent dosages. This observation supports the proposed site concept. When benzene gradually 146 TABLE 1 Dosing of the catalyst with benzene Dose number 1 2 3 4 5 6 time on stream (h) 51.5 69.5 71.8 91.8 94.2 113.2 amount of benzene fed (g) 0.03 0.1 0.29 0.135 0.135 0.135 cumulative amount fed (g) 0.03 0.13 0.42 0.555 0.69 0.825 so loo Time on stream, h Fig. 1. Effect of consecutive benzene dosages on the rncand P. eliminates the long-chain synthesis sites, it is mainly secondary initiation by readsorbed alkenes which is inhibited and as such has little influence on the overall rate of hydrocarbon synthesis. The initial decrease is attributed to poisoning of the most active fraction of long-chain synthesis sites. The decrease in activity after the first treatment was less marked for the overall rate of methane formation (22% decrease) than for the overall rate of hydrocarbon synthesis (38% decrease). This observation is in line with the proposed site concept, which predicts selective poisoning of long-chain synthesis sites by benzene while methanation sites remain unaffected. That long-chain synthesis sites are selectively poisoned by benzene is illustrated by the observation that the decrease in P is related to the cumula- tive dosage of benzene. The effect was strong at first, but became less pronounced with consecutive benzene dosages to eventually level out to a value associated with synthesis on short-chain synthesis sites only (Fig. 2). Effect of benzene treatment on medium pressure synthesis Synthesis was carried out at 2.0 MPa. The increase in reaction pressure from 0.3 to 2.0 MPa resulted in an increase in the value of P from 0.50 to 0.67. The observed increase is in line with an expected increase in readsorp- 147 0.50 - p 0.40 - 0.30 - 0 0.5 1.0 Accumulated amount of benzene passed through the catalyst (g/g ) Fig. 2. Correlation between the accumulated amount of benzene fed on P. tion and hence re-initiation of olefinic primary products when the pressure is increased. In contrast to the experiments at low pressure when no inflection point in ASF plots was observed, a dual slope ASF plot is found at 2.0 MPa. We attribute this observation to a much higher synthesis activity on the long- chain synthesis sites at 2.0 MPa. Egiebor et al. [23] reported that ASF plots of the product from syn- thesis at 0.7 MPa with iron catalysts showed an inflection point for the alkanes but no inflection point for alkenes. From these observations they concluded that both alkenes and alkanes are primary products, each having a characteristic rate of termination and a common rate of propagation. Our work with alkene additions has shown that this is very unlikely [4]. We suggest that it is more likely that additional heavy hydrocarbons are formed via alkene-initiated synthesis on long-chain synthesis sites, a process which is pressure-controlled (readsorption). Since secondary hydrogenation is also pressure-dependent, it is conceivable that at 0.3 MPa we did not find any inflection points, at 0.7 MPa a break point was observed by Egiebor et al. for the alkanes only and at 2.0 MPa we found inflection points for both alkanes and alkenes. After 90 h on stream, 0.2 g of benzene was passed per g catalyst. The value of P for the light products decreased from 0.67 to 0.58 (Fig. 3). In addition, a shift of the inflection point for the alkenes is observed from carbon number 10 to 14. Clearly a large fraction of the long-chain synthesis sites is poisoned by benzene. No change in inflection point is observed for the alkanes, since they are formed by secondary hydrogenation only. 148 4>n 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 n Fig. 3.

Implications for the hydrocarbon synthesis mechanism Any mechanism proposed for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis must account for the experimental observations. It is not really apparent that all mechanisms proposed to date satisfy this requirement. An example of a mechanism (Fig. 4) which does accommodate our experimental observations is given below: Primary reactions Initiation: The gas phase components of synthesis gas are in a dynamic equilibrium with their adsorbed counterparts, which in turn react to form, inter alia, two reactive, intermediate carbidic species, denoted oCf and (3Cf. The latter is very reactive. It can react either with hydrogen to form methane (termination by hydrogenation) or with oC^ to form higher hydrocarbons (propagation by reaction with oCf to form C|). In addition, ethene (and no other alkene) can react with the surface to form a highly reactive surface intermediate capable of synthesis initiation. 149 WEAK STRONG IN TIATION TERMINATION [aC * 1 ^ ]:-= [^ \"zlaos ^CH4 .r nr1^ ^'^ - - - - -- p^i PROPAGATION *aC*j C2*^^r: ^ ^^: Cg H4 CgHe -oC*|| ^C* ^.os^ \" - - \"\"\" ^S^6 ^Hg C3-^7 +oC* '^-,03^ - \"- C4 Hg 64 H|O c, ^ \"^.OS^ ^ \"-CnHan .CnHzn+z -c;OR Cn1\"-- ^ \"^.os-^ *CniHZ(n *cC| 1\"C*- ^~~~ ~tn*in) ^ - ~~~'^' (n+m \"Ztn-mi) y^ntm^ZtntmltZ^-.os7 ^ ^ntmtl) Fig. 4. Example of a mechanism of hydrocarbon synthesis which is consistent with our experimental observations. Propagation: Chain growth may be propagated by reaction of either aC^ or j3Cf with aCf to form the highly reactive surface intermediate C^, or by further reaction of C^ with j3Cf to form the surface intermediate C^, The latter, as well as C^, can further react with aC? to form surface intermediates with a higher carbon number. Termination: Chain growth may be terminated in three different ways. Surface intermediates can either desorb as the linear alkenes, interact with another growing chain or react with an alkene or an ocC^ species to form mainly branched alkenes. Secondary reactions Methane is the only primary product which is saturated. Unsaturated primary products are formed on mild hydrogenation sites only. They can 150 move to stronger hydrogenation sites either by surface movement or by desorption and readsorption. If the hydrogenation strength of those sites is sufficient, they will be hydrogenated to alkanes. If the hydrogenation strength of the sites used for readsorption is low and the intrinsic skeleton isomerization activity is high enough, the skeleton of the alkene is isomerized to form a branched alkene. This alkene in turn may later be hydrogenated to a branched alkane. Any desorbed alkene can readsorb and either react via alkylation with a growing hydrocarbon chain to form (preferentially) a branched olefin or propagate the synthesis reaction. Many details of the proposed mechanism have been included to accom- modate results from co-feeding experiments [3-5]. We have shown [3] that ethene is rapidly incorporated into the growing chains without any poisoning effect, while the formation of methane is strongly repressed [2]. This occurs at high concentrations (10 mol%), at which other alkenes repress synthesis activity [4, 5]. If ethene would pre- ferentially react with one (or more) of the higher intermediates in partic- ular, either ASF statistics would not apply or the value of P would change. Neither of the two was observed. Large scale alkylation is unlikely, since that would also apply for the other two alkenes investigated; this was also not observed. The only explanation which is consistent with all the observations, including methane repression, is that ethene is able to form a reactive inter- mediate. Since there is no evidence to the contrary and in order not to com- plicate the scheme more than necessary, it is assumed that this intermediate is the same as C^. However, the ability to form this reactive intermediate does not explain why the formation of methane is repressed. This repression can be readily explained if the existence of more than one different reactive carbidic Ci intermediate species is assumed. That such species exist at the surface has been reported by several research groups [24-30]. For our explanation, only two different species are necessary, denoted as aC? and ^Cf. It has been suggested by Kieffer and van der Baan [27] that one species is readily formed during coadsorption, while another type is formed during the synthesis reaction. This species is reported to be very reactive towards hydrogen, producing both methane and higher hydro- carbons. It is not suggested that our two species are identical to those identified by Kieffer and van der Baan, but for our argument it is supposed that j3C? has properties similar to the second species reported by him. Introduction of a large amount of ethene into a steady-state synthesis situation has a variety of consequences if our proposed mechanism is correct. Initially a large surface coverage of ethene will occur, choking the synthesis process. This explains the initial decrease in activity. Adsorbed ethene is then rapidly converted to C^ which competes strongly with hydrogen for the available species with which both can react. This accelerates the synthesis activity again until a new steady-state is reached, in which only a small constant concentration of adsorbed ethene exists on the surface, and syn- 151 thesis gas can play its normal role. This explains increased activity and decreased methane formation on ethene addition to the feed. That an additional and more stringent mechanism for methane repres- sion than just hydrogen-scavenging was operative under ethene co-feeding conditions, was already concluded from co-feeding experiments involving higher alkenes [4, 5] where it was observed that when propene or butenes were co-fed at the same concentration as ethene, a much lower degree of methane repression occurred. If only one type of Cf species were present on the surface, the forma- tion of C3+ hydrocarbons would be repressed to an extent similar to that seen for methane. This is not the case and the presence of another C? building block is indicated. In this scheme, no change in the existing product distribution is expected or observed when ethene is co-fed. Propene and butene, added in moderate amounts, give some increase in activity since they are capable of propagation or alkylation of the growing hydrocarbon chains. This does not alter the applicability of ASF statistics, since a modeling study has shown that random alkylation follows the same kinetics as those known as ASF statistics [31]. Alkylation may therefore alter the value of the growth probability, though this may not necessarily occur. Since the rate of alkylation is much lower than that of synthesis (only a moderate increase in synthesis activity has been observed on 5 mol% addi- tion of propene or butene), only a slight change in the value of the apparent overall 'growth probability' can be expected when the value of the alkylation probability is different. In fact, small co-feeding concentration-dependent changes in the value of the apparent overall 'growth probability' were observed when propene or butenes were co-fed. When present in larger amounts in the feed, these alkenes appear to occupy so much of the catalyst surface that a marked decrease in activity is caused, without there being a noticeable change in the product distribution by carbon number, except for the decrease in hydrocarbons attributed to a repression of readsorption of ethene. Because of its lower heat of adsorption, ethene desorbs and adsorbs far more frequently than the higher alkenes, making it the most mobile of the primary products. This in turn increases the chances that it encounters a strong hydrogenation site and undergoes secondary hydrogenation, and it is generally found, in particular at higher pressures (Table 2), that C; has a much lower olefin/paraffin ratio than other hydrocarbons. As a result of its 'site-hopping' properties, ethene can readily participate in propagation, thereby decreasing its concentration in the synthesis product. This explains why a dip for C; hydrocarbons is generally observed in ASF plots, in partic- ular at higher pressures when readsorption is favoured. Figure 3 shows that the dip is caused by ethene and that the ethane concentration follows ASF statistics. At lower pressures the dip is less pronounced, and at 0.3 MPa we observed that the dip disappeared entirely from the product spectrum. When higher alkenes are co-fed in large amounts at a pressure of 2 MPa, they occupy a large fraction of the surface, thereby hampering readsorption 152 TABLE 2 Influence of pressure on the catalyst behaviour Pressure (MPa) 0.3 2.0 rHcOumols-'g-1) % m/m alkenes in C^ % m/m alkenes in % m/m alkenes in C^-Cs % m/m Ci P 0.5 88 95 92 25 0.50 11 58 88 82 7 0.67 of ethene. Again its concentration in the product is increased and the dip disappears. The increase in olefin selectivity, observed with most co-feeding exper- iments, may be attributed to competition by the co-feed for sites where hydrogenation of alkenes takes place. That all differences in catalytic behaviour, occasioned by co-feeding, were reversible, is consistent with the mechanism which allows for parallel and sequential reactions. It should be emphasized that the mechanism shown in Fig. 4 is only an example of a mechanism which is consistent with our results obtained with iron-based catalysts. Effect of pressure on the catalytic behaviour In the above discussion, we have seen that the synthesis pressure has a profound influence on the catalytic behaviour. Secondary reactions are controlled by the adsorption/desorption equilibria, which in turn are a func- tion of pressure. Several examples of the influence of pressure are given in Table 2. It is implied from Fig. 4 that all reactions involving dynamic adsorption/desorption equilibria will have their equilibria shifted towards the adsorbed state when the pressure is raised, and such an effect is consistent with the data presented in Table 2. The overall rate of reaction increases far in excess of the expected value based on the increase in partial hydrogen pressure, which indicates an increase by a factor of 3.3. The increase is to a value of 11, indicating addi- tional secondary activity by an extra factor of 3.3. A marked decrease in the various olefin selectivities indicates the increase in secondary hydrogenation, in particular of ethene. Because methanation remains relatively constant and the increase in activity is largely due to secondary activity on the long-chain synthesis sites, the percentage methane in the product decreases by dilution. Secondary activity boosted the overall activity by a factor 3.3 and the methane concen- tration decreased by a factor of 3.4. It is perhaps not immediately apparent why the growth probability is affected so greatly by pressure. At least two reasons could be given for this 153 effect. In the first place, termination by alkylation is enhanced since it involves readsorption of unsaturated primary products. This type of termina- tion enlarges the molar size of the products and hence the growth probabil- ity. In the second place the growth probability is, by its very nature, influenced by at least two different factors. The availability of building blocks is one factor, and synthesis termination is another. In our example of a possible mechanism (Fig. 4), those building blocks are Cf and C$ species, the concentration of which is increased by increased adsorption. This enhanced concentration of building blocks again increases the growth probability. The probability should not be affected by the contact time, as is some- times suggested (albeit not in the literature). To investigate the point, the space velocity was increased six-fold in an experiment, but no change in the growth probability was observed. Conclusions The results discussed in this communication have shown that readsorp- tion and secondary reaction of the initially produced alkenes is an important pathway leading to the formation of long-chain hydrocarbons during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Synthesis sites can be differentiated into short- chain and long-chain synthesis sites. Synthesis initiation by readsorbed alkenes on long-chain synthesis sites is favoured by increased reaction pres- sure and leads to the formation of predominantly long-chain hydrocarbons. When this 'long-chain synthesis' becomes more pronounced, inflection points are observed in Anderson-Schulz-Flory plots of the product distribution. In general, secondary reactions are found to be very dependent on dynamic adsorption/desorption equilibria. An example of a mechanism which is consistent with our experimental observations is presented.

Snel University of Twente, Faculty of Chemical Technology, P.O. Box 217, 7500 AE EnschedeThe Netherlands Results from alkene co-feeding and benzene poisoning experiments indicate that readsorption and secondary reaction of initially produced alkenes is an important pathway leading to the formation of long-chain hydrocarbons during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Synthesis sites are differentiated in short-chain and long-chain synthesis sites. Synthesis initiation by readsorbed alkenes on long-chain synthesis sites is favoured by increased reaction pressure and leads to the formation of predominantly long-chain hydrocarbons. When this type of synthesis becomes more pronounced, inflection points are observed in Anderson-Schulz-Flory plots of the product distribution. Secondary reactions are found to be very dependent on dynamic adsorption/desorption equilibria. An example of a mechanism which is consistent with the experimental observations is presented.
