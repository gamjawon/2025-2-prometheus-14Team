After appropriate treatment, germanium and silicon alkyl compounds are active promoters for supported rhenium oxide catalysts for the metathesis of hex-1-ene and methyl oleate. The effect of replacement of R4Sn by germanium and silicon derivatives as the promoter for the catalyst system Re2O7/SiO2-Al2O3 in the metathesis of hex-1-ene, and the system Re2O7/B2O3/SiO2-Al2O3 in the metathesis of methyl oleate, was studied. The new promoters react slowly with the rhenium oxide. An activation time of about 15min at temperatures varying from 50 to 75°C is required for obtaining a good catalytic activity. These promoters can replace the toxic tin compounds, although they give rise to lower turnover numbers in the metathesis of methyl oleate. Keywords Olefin metathesis Rhenium oxide catalysts Germanium Silicon Hexene Methyl oleate 1 Introduction Rhenium oxide supported on alumina or silica-alumina is a well-known catalyst for alkene metathesis [1,2]. The use of silica-alumina as support leads to a higher activity, but the selectivity is lower. An improvement of the catalytic activity is obtained by promotion with R4Sn or R4Pb (R = alkyl) and, moreover, it then becomes active for the metathesis of functionalised olefins such as unsaturated esters, e.g. methyl oleate (methyl cis-9-octadecenoate); Eq. (1). The latter reaction has interesting possibilities for the oleochemistry [3]. (1) 2Me(CH 2)7 CHCH(CH 2)7 COOMe⇌Me(CH 2)7 CHCH(CH 2)7 Me+MeOOC(CH 2)7 CHCH(CH 2)7 COOMe In the presence of these catalysts, the reaction takes place already at room temperature. It has been suggested that the promoter is involved in the formation of new initiating metal-alkylidene species via double alkylation of the rhenium, followed by α-H elimination [4]. The active sites generated by R4Sn or R4Pb may be intrinsically different from those present on the unpromoted catalyst [5]. However, the tin- and lead-containing promoters are toxic. Therefore, we studied the possibility to replace these promoters by germanium and silicon compounds, evaluating both their reactivity towards Re2O7-based catalysts and the catalytic performance of the resulting systems in the metathesis reaction. Silicon derivatives have been proved to be good co-catalysts for WCl6 [6] and WOCl4 [7] in the metathesis of functionalised olefins, but there are no reports of a successful application of this kind of compound as a promoter for rhenium oxide based catalysts. 2 Experimental The Re2O7/SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by wet impregnation of silica-alumina (Akzo. 24.3wt.% Al2O3, surface area 347m2/g, porosity 0.88cm3/g) with an aqueous solution of NH4ReO4, followed by drying at 110°C overnight and calcination under air at 500°C for 2h. Silica-alumina supports with 5wt.% boria were prepared in the same way using an aqueous solution of boric acid for the impregnation step. For studying the reactivity between neohexene and the system Re2O7/B2O3/SiO2-Al2O3/promoter, the catalyst (∼150mg) was calcined in flowing air for 2h at 550°C, followed by a nitrogen purge for 15min at the same temperature. After cooling to room temperature, calculated volumes of Et4Ge (Aldrich, 99%), Et4Si (Aldrich, 97%), Et4Sn (Aldrich, 97%), Bu3GeH (Aldrich, 99%), Bu3SnH (Fluka, 99%) or Et2SiH2 (Aldrich, 99%) dissolved in n-heptane (Merck, 99%, distilled over Na/benzophenone), were added to the catalyst via a syringe through a rubber septum. The catalytic system was then heated during 15min for catalyst activation. After cooling to room temperature, 1ml of 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene (neohexene, Fluka, 95%) was added to the reaction vessel, via a syringe. After 10s, the reaction products were trapped in liquid nitrogen. Analyses of the gas phase were performed using an HP 5890 gas chromatograph, equipped with an Al2O3/KCl on fused silica capillary column (50 m×0.32 mm) and a flame ionisation detector. For the catalytic experiments, the freshly calcined catalyst (∼150mg) was cooled to room temperature and transferred to a glass batch reactor under argon. The catalyst was then allowed to react with 0.5ml of an n-heptane solution containing the calculated volume of co-catalyst. After stirring at the desired temperature for the selected time, the reactor was cooled to room temperature and the substrate was added via syringe. In the metathesis of hex-1-ene (Aldrich, 97%), 4.0ml of n-heptane and 0.2ml of decane (internal standard) were also added to the reaction vessel. Conversions were determined by GC analysis of the liquid phase using an HP 5 capillary column. Cis/trans ratios of the diesters were determined using a CP-Sil 88 capillary column. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Metathesis of hex-1-ene Metathesis of hex-1-ene was used as test reaction for the catalytic activity (Eq. (2)) (2) 2CH 2CH(CH 2)3 CH 3⇌CH 3(CH 2)3 CHCH(CH 2)3 CH 3+CH 2CH 2 When R4Ge and R4Si (R=Me, Et, Bu) were allowed to react with Re2O7/SiO2-Al2O3 at room temperature, an instantaneous colour change (from white to brownish) was observed. Because germanium and silicon are less active as alkylating agents than tin and lead, it was anticipated that a higher temperature is required than room temperature as in the case of tin or lead. Heating at 50 or 75°C for R4Ge and R4Si, respectively, for 15min gave a significant increase in amount of gases evolved during the reaction of the promoter with the catalyst (Fig. 1 ). For instance, from <0.05 (at rt) to 0.12 (at 50°C) mol of butane/mol Re were released in the case of Bu4Ge. Moreover, the metathesis activity also increased with increasing temperature during the contact between the catalyst and the promoter (Fig. 2 ). Table 1 shows that the addition of a promoter improves the performance of the catalyst in the metathesis of hex-1-ene: not only the conversion is increased, but also the selectivity. Clearly, the addition of the promoter decreases side reactions such as double bond shift in the substrate followed by secondary metathesis reactions. In general, germanium compounds are a better promoter than silicon compounds. For R=Me, the activity is the lowest, whereas the release of gas was the highest for Me4Ge. The addition of Me4Si even deactivates the catalyst. For Si-containing promoters the highest activity was obtained when the reaction temperature between promoter and catalyst was 75°C. In the case of Bu4Ge, a further increase in activation temperature led to a higher amount of released butane, but the catalytic activity did not improve. This suggests that heating above 50°C promotes a reaction between unreacted Bu4Ge and remaining surface OH groups. An increase of the ratio Ge/Re gave an increase in conversion as well as in selectivity up to a value of 0.55 for the selectivity. Kawai et al. [8] tested some of these promoters in the metathesis of 4-bromobut-1-ene in the presence of a Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst. Me4Ge gave some enhancement in activity, whereas Me4Si showed no enhancement in activity at all. 3.2 Metathesis of methyl oleate Next, the activity for the metathesis of methyl oleate was studied. For this study we choose B2O3/SiO2-Al2O3 as the support, because it leads to a higher activity, at least in the metathesis of methyl undecenoate [3,9]. Table 2 shows the activities of the catalyst system Re2O7/B2O3/SiO2-Al2O3 after treatment with different promoters. We choose a loading of 2wt.% Re2O7 because that loading gives the highest specific activity [11]. It should be kept in mind that without a promoter the catalyst is not active in this reaction. For comparison, data obtained with a Bu4Sn promoter are also given in the Table. Table 2 shows that the catalytic activity is not only promoted by R4M (M=Ge, Si or Sn), but also by mono-hydride derivatives (HMBu3) (M=Ge, Si, Sn), although to a lower extent. H2SiEt2 does not induce activity. The Table also shows that with a tetraalkyl-metal promoter the obtained cis/trans ratio of the diester is ∼0.22, which is the thermodynamic equilibrium value. With the hydrides we got a higher cis/trans ratio, viz. 0.83, which means a preference for the cis isomer compared to the thermodynamic value. This result suggests a different environment for the rhenium centre in the active site. 3.3 Reactivity between promoted Re2O7/B2O3/SiO2-Al2O3 and neohexene Based on volumetric and spectroscopic studies of the interaction between R4Sn and Re2O7 supported on silica-alumina or alumina, Buffon et al. proposed the formation of surface species as depicted in Scheme 1 [4,10]. A double alkylation, followed by an α-H-abstraction would lead to a rhenium-alkylidene species C, a minor surface species. They also observed that there was no direct correlation between the amounts of gas released during the interaction catalyst—R4Sn and the catalytic activity of the resulting system. We observed the same feature with Ge and Si derivatives. In order to verify if an alkylidene ligand could be identified via a metathetical exchange reaction, the catalysts were allowed to react with neohexene in a flow reactor. Neohexene is a very bulky alkene and its self-metathesis has never been reported [1]. If the reaction of Re2O7/support with Et4Si or Et4Ge led to the formation of a rhenium-alkylidene ligand, propene (as well as 4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene) should be detected as a first formed product; Eq. (3). (3) Self-metathesis of the propene formed would lead to ethene and but-2-ene. Qualitative results obtained using Et4Si, Et4Ge and Et4Sn indeed showed the formation of such products (Table 3 ). Moreover, the ratios butene/propene are in good agreement with the increasing catalytic activity induced by these promoters (Et4Si<Et4Ge<Et4Sn). Et2SiH2 did not lead to a Re-ethylidene species. With Bu3GeH and Bu3SnH, pent-1-ene would be the first formed alkene. Its presence was not detected, nor the formation of ethene, its self-metathesis product. These results suggest that no Re-alkylidene species are formed with promoters bearing hydride ligands. The initial carbene species necessary for metathesis would arise from a reaction between surface hydride species and the olefin. 4 Conclusions After appropriate treatment, germanium and silicon alkyl compounds are active promoters for supported rhenium catalysts in the metathesis reaction. They can replace the toxic alkyltin- and -lead analogues, although they induce a lower activity.

The new promoters react slowly with the rhenium oxide. An activation time of about 15min at temperatures varying from 50 to 75°C is required for obtaining a good catalytic activity. These promoters can replace the toxic tin compounds, although they give rise to lower turnover numbers in the metathesis of methyl oleate.",
