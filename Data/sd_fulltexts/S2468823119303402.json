Graphical abstract The additive effect of amines on the supported PdO catalyzed-dihydroxylation of buta-1,3-diene is first examined. The significant enhancement of the synthetic efficiency for the diol products is achieved by the addition of less hindered strong bases, such as morpholines and N-methylimidazole. Notably, we found that the amine additive is indispensable to keep the catalytic activity during the recycling test, which is never mentioned in previous reports. Furthermore, both the fresh and spent catalysts are characterized by attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) observation and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements. Keywords Buta-1,3-diene Butane-1,4-diol Tetrahydrofuran Palladium catalysts Introduction Supported transition metal particles, which are an important class of heterogeneous catalysts, have wide applications to facilitate the industrial conversion of the petroleum-based feedstocks into the high value-added chemicals [1,2]. Enhancement of the catalytic efficiency invariably exists as a central topic in most of these processes. Additionally, due to the growing concerns over the environment and fossil fuel costs, development of the heterogeneously catalyzed synthetic reactions by using the environmentally benign reactants is also attracted much attention nowadays [3]. Butane-1,4-diol is a useful synthetic intermediate for basic chemicals such as tetrahydrofuran, γ-butyrolactone, polybutylene terephthalate, polyurethane resin, etc. [4,5], and possesses the annual demand in about one million metric tons over the world [6]. The most popular route to butane-1,4-diol is the process based on “Reppe Chemistry” started from acetylene [7]. However, the high cost for a specific instrument is required because of the safety issues, and moreover, polymerization of the acetylene is causing problems for deactivation of the catalyst [8,9]. A major alternative synthetic route starts from buta-1,3-diene, which is oxidized by O2 in the presence of acetic acid with heterogeneous Pd-Te catalysts into but-2-ene-1,4-diyl diacetate (1,4-diacetoxy-2-butene: 1,4-DABE). Then, alkene hydrogenation followed by hydrolysis of diesters affords butane-1,4-diol (Scheme 1 a) [10,11]. Although this strategy works efficiently for not only the production of butane-1,4-diol but also the synthesis of various primary alcohols [12–14], the acetoxylation-hydrolysis process brings down a low atom efficiency. In particular, for the large-scale productions, the hydrolysis of diesters consumes high energy in distillative removal of excess water from water-miscible products [15,16]. Besides, acetic acid has been used as a disposable unit in order to introduce oxygen functionality. It is more desirable that the direct transformation of buta-1,3-diene into but-2-ene-1,4-diol utilizing water as oxygen nucleophile, which affords 100% atom efficiency. The addition of water to buta-1,3-diene was examined in 1971, by Manyik et al. using homogeneous Pd catalysts under high pressure of CO2 [17]. However, the reaction produces dimerized C8 compounds exclusively via bis-π-allyl intermediate, which is so-called telomerization process (Scheme 1b). Recently, Kuznetsova and our group reported a process to give C4 diols using supported Pd catalysts [18,19]. Interestingly, no telomerization takes place when the active Pd species deposited on the oxide surfaces, but there still has room to improve the yield of diol products. More importantly, the unspecified recyclability of these catalysts may preclude their further industrial applications. In this paper, we report here an additive effect of amines, into the metal oxide-supported PdO catalyzed the direct transformation of buta-1,3-diene with water into but-2-ene-1,4-diol, resulting in the distinct enhancements of the catalytic activity and recyclability (Scheme 1c). Experimental Material Palladium nitrate (Pd(NO3)2) aqueous solution (200 g-Pd/L) was purchased from Tanaka Kikinzoku KK. CeO2 with a specific surface area of 58 m2/g was obtained from Kojundo Chemical Laboratory. ZrO2 (RC-100) and CeO2-ZrO2 (containing 40% CeO2) with specific surface areas of 91 m2/g and 54 m2/g, respectively, were supplied by Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Co., LTD. All commercial starting materials and reagents were used as received. Catalyst preparation Metal oxide supported PdO catalysts were prepared by the impregnation (IMP) method. The palladium loading was adjusted to 2 wt%. Pd(NO3)2 aqueous solution (102 μL) was diluted in a small amount of water. ZrO2, CeO2 or CeO2-ZrO2 (1.0 g) was added into the aqueous solution and stirred at RT for 30 min. After impregnation, H2O was removed by freeze-drying. The obtained catalysts were calcined at 550 °C for 4 h to obtain PdO/ZrO2 and PdO/CeO2 [20,21]. Characterization High angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) observations were performed using a JEOL JEM-ARM200 F. The palladium amounts in the catalysts were analyzed by microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (MP-AES) using an Agilent 4100 MP-AES. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of catalysts were obtained by JASCO FT-IR 6100 with an attenuated total reflection (ATR) accessory equipped with a single reflection ZnSe. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Rigaku MiniFlex600 with a high-intensity CuKα radiation source (λ =0.15418 nm). X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements were performed at the BL14B2 beamline of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) [22,23]. The XAFS samples were ground with boron nitride in an agate mortar and compacted into pellets. Pd K-edge (24.3 keV) XAFS spectra were measured using a Si (311) double–crystal monochromator in transmission mode. The spectral analysis was performed using the XAFS analysis software Athena [24]. Conversions and product yields for the transformation of buta-1,3-diene into 2-butene-1,4-diol were analyzed by GC using an Agilent GC 6850 Series II equipped with FID and a J&W HP-INNOWAX column (0.25 μm thickness, 0.32 mm I.D., 30 m) using diglyme as an internal standard. GC mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed with a Thermo Fisher Scientific Polaris Q equipped with a J&W HP-1 column (0.25 μm thickness, 0.25 mm I.D., 30 m). Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed with Merck, TLC silica gel 60 F254 plates. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (Kanto Chemicals, Silica gel 60 N, spherical, neutral, particle size 40–100 μm). General procedures for the transformation of buta-1,3-diene (Table 1) A glass tube placed in an autoclave was charged with distilled water (5 mmol), supported PdO (Pd 0.4 mol%), 1,4-dioxane (2 mL), amine ligand (0.4 mol%), and a magnetic stirring bar. The autoclave was placed in a liquid nitrogen bath to decrease the temperature to below 0 °C, and buta-1,3-diene (33–48 mmol) was introduced to the autoclave. The autoclave was purged and filled with O2 until the pressure reached 2.0 MPa, and then stirred at 60 °C for 48 h. After the reaction, the mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was analyzed by GC using diglyme as an internal standard. Recycling experiments (Fig. 2) A glass tube placed in an autoclave was charged with distilled water (5 mmol), 2 wt% PdO/CeO2-ZrO2 (Pd 0.4 mol%), 1,4-dioxane (2 mL), N-methylmorpholine (0.4 mol%), and a magnetic stirring bar. The autoclave was placed in a liquid nitrogen bath to decrease the temperature to below 0 °C, and buta-1,3-diene (33–48 mmol) was introduced to the autoclave. The autoclave was purged and filled with O2 until the pressure reached 2.0 MPa, and then stirred at 60 °C for 48 h. After the reaction, the catalyst was separated by filtration and the filtrate was analyzed by GC using diglyme as an internal standard. The catalyst was washed with MeOH (3 × 5 mL) and dried under 100 °C overnight before another run. Results and discussion In our previous report, when allylbenzene was chosen as a substrate for the Pd-catalyzed oxidative hydration, the activity varies depending on the chemical states of Pd on catalyst [19]. Among them, Pd(NO3)2 and Pd(OH)2 on ZrO2, CeO2, and CeO2-ZrO2 exhibited high activities but supported Pd0 and PdO catalysts showed poor activities. In contrast, the reaction of buta-1,3-diene into butenediols proceeded smoothly regardless of the Pd species probably owing to the strong coordination ability of the diene, which changes the rate determining step. This time we chose supported PdO catalysts for further study using batch reactor. Here, the chemical yields were calculated based on the amount of H2O (5 mmol) like as the previous report because it is difficult to introduce and weigh the constant amount of gaseous buta-1,3-diene while it is easy for liquid water. In Table 1 , PdO/CeO2 showed a moderate activity and gave but-2-en-1,4-diol (1), but-3-en-1,2-diol (2), and 4-hydroxybut-2-enal (3) in 3%, 2%, and 1%, respectively (Table 1, entry 1). When PdO/ZrO2 and PdO/CeO2-ZrO2 were used, slightly better yields were observed (Table 1, entries 2 and 3). The addition of dicyclohexylamine (4) as a ligand to PdO/ZrO2 improved the catalytic activity and the yield of 1 was 16% (Table 1, entry 5), although inorganic base (K2CO3) did not at all (Table 1, entry 4). Thus, other amines (5–11) listed in Fig. 1 were examined to see the effect of amine ligands. Diphenylamine (5), having weak basicity, did not increase the activity (Table 1, entry 6). On the other hand, the addition of less hindered strong bases, such as morpholines (7 and 8), N-methylimidazole (10), and N,N-dimethyl-4-aminopyridine (DMAP, 12), significantly enhanced the TONs of the catalyst (Table 1, entries 8, 9, 10, 13, and 15). A bulky strong base 9 gave poor results (Table 1, entries 11 and 12). The highest yield was achieved with the combination of 8 and PdO/CeO2-ZrO2 providing the product, 1, 2, and 3 in 48%, 49%, and 26%, respectively, and the corresponding TON could reach to 308 (Table 1, entry 10). Here, the total yield of 1, 2, and 3 exceeded 100%, maybe because H2O was produced as a byproduct from re-oxidation of reduced PdO catalyst and over-oxidation of 1 into 3. Furthermore, the correlation between the ligand (8) loading and the catalytic efficiency was investigated (Table 2 ). A remarkable enhancement of the catalytic performance was observed by addition of 8 even at the loading of 0.1 mol% (0.25 eq.) (Table 2, entry 1 vs. 2). The products yields and the TONs of the catalyst were gradually increased with the augment of the ligand loading to 0.4 mol%, which is an equivalent amount of Pd used in the model reaction (Table 2, entries 2–4). Additionally, although increasing the amine loading to 0.8 mol% still raised its TON, slight decreases of the activity were observed by further addition of the ligand over 0.8 mol% (Table 2, entries 5–7). These results clearly demonstrated that the addition of 8 with an appropriate loading could efficiently improve the catalytic performance of PdO/CeO2-ZrO2. Next, catalyst recycling experiments were carried out under the reaction conditions of Table 1, entry 10. The reaction mixture was filtrated and the catalyst was washed three times with methanol. As shown in Fig. 2 , the reuse of the catalyst without re-addition of 8 resulted in a decrease in activity (Fig. 2a). In contrast, the recycle with re-addition of 8 each time kept the activity at least 5 times (Fig. 2b), indicating that the amine (8) is indispensable for the high activity but does not bind strongly to the catalyst and washed out by methanol. In addition, the amount of residual Pd in the filtrate was analyzed by microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (MP-AES). The result showed that about 2% of Pd species used was leached into the solution (calculated amount of charged Pd was 2 mg), and this value is within the normal range for heterogeneous catalysts. ATR-IR spectra were measured for the recovered catalyst (PdO/CeO2-ZrO2) (Fig. 3 a) and N-methylmorpholine (Fig. 3b). The characteristic peaks in (b) appeared at 2750–3000 cm–1 which can be assigned for stretching vibration of CH next to the nitrogen atom of N-methylmorpholine. These peaks cannot be observed in the spectrum (a), which suggests a loss of the amine by washing and consistent with the result of the recycling experiment. X-ray diffraction analyses were performed for CeO2-ZrO2-supported PdO (Fig. 4 ). The major peaks of XRD patterns can be assigned to support CeO2-ZrO2. The highest peak of PdO was completely overlapped with them, which ought to be observed at 2θ = 33.7 ° from the diffraction of (101) plane. On the other hand, two peaks of PdO were recognized at 2θ = 42.0 and 54.9 degrees in PdO/CeO2-ZrO2 corresponding to crystal planes of (110) and (112) of PdO (Fig. 3 (a) and (b)). The Pd catalysts were also characterized by XAFS measurement. The Pd K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra and radial structure functions of (a) PdO/ZrO2, (b) PdO/ZrO2 after reaction, (c) PdO, and (d) Pd foil are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 . The features of the spectra are closer between the catalysts (a), (b), and authentic PdO rather than Pd foil. Two peaks centered at around 1.5 and 2.9 Å (phase-uncorrected) in PdO were correspond to the interaction of Pd–O for the first coordination shell and Pd–(O)–Pd for the second one, respectively. In the cases of (a) and (b), the peak intensity at 2.9 Å was very weak, attributable to the small particle sizes of PdO on ZrO2. The catalysts after the reaction have a slightly higher peak centered around 1.5 Å, which suggests subtle aggregation takes place under the reaction conditions. A possible reaction pathway for supported PdO-catalyzed oxidative hydration of buta-1,3-diene was speculated in Fig. 7 . Initially, according the infrared spectroscopy studies, the supported PdO species were stabilized by the coordination of the amine ligand, followed by the chelation of buta-1,3-diene to afford the intermediate B. H2O then attacked its terminal position to form a π-allyl Pd intermediate C. The but-2-en-1,4-diol (or but-3-en-1,2-diol) was subsequently generated after the addition by another molecular H2O to the terminal (or internal) position. After that, the catalyst was oxidized by O2 to re-generate the PdII species for another catalytic cycle. Conclusion In conclusion, the efficiency for supported PdO catalyzed-dihydroxylation of buta-1,3-diene is obviously enhanced by the addition of several amine ligands, especially for the less hindered strong bases. Although the amine did not bind strongly to the catalyst, the recyclability of the catalyst could be improved by re-addition of the amine, which is of great importance for industrial applications.
