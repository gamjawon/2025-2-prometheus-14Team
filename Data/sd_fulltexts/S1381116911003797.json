Graphical abstract Disproportionation of water insoluble 1,2-dihydronaphthalene derivatives takes place by either RhCl3–Aliquat® 336 entrapped in octylated sol–gel or by Pd(OAc)2 within a similar support. During the catalytic process the pre-catalysts are converted into recyclable supported nanoparticles. Highlights ► Replacement of organic solvents by aqueous microemulsions. ► Disproportionation of water insoluble substrates in aqueous media. ► Recylcing of the catalyst as supported active metallic nanoparticles. In the course of our attempts to replace the traditional, but harmful, organic solvents in synthetic processes by environmentally favored benign media, we studied the disproportionation of hydrophobic vicinal dihydroarenes in water. This reaction takes place efficiently by either sol–gel-entrapped [(C8H17)3NCH3][RhCl4] ion pair or by immobilized Pd(OAc)2, together with a suitable surfactant to give tetrahydroarenes and fully aromatic products. Since a slow dehydrogenation process accompanies this process the latter products are usually formed in excess. The reactions are also accompanied by transformation of the heterogenized catalysts into sol–gel-stabilized metallic particles, which can be recycled without loss of activity for at least five runs. The rhodium (but not the palladium) promoted disproportionations that follow the pseudo first order rate law. The reactions are influenced by both the electronic and steric structures of the dihydroarenes, as well as by the nature of the surfactant and by the hydrophobicity of the ceramic sol–gel support. Deuterio-labeling indicates slight involvement of the water in the disproportionation process. Keywords Heterogeneous catalysis Disproportionation Palladium Rhodium Sustainable chemistry 1 Introduction In the course of our attempts to replace the conventional, harmful solvents in organic synthesis by water [1,2] we have developed a three-phase emulsion/solid state (EST) system for transport and catalysis [3]. This system enables to perform hydrogenations [4], hydroformylations [5], C–C couplings [6] and double bond isomerizations in water [7] even when the reactants, catalysts and products are lipophobic water-insoluble compounds. The use of aqueous microemulsions [8], together with sol–gel entrapped organometallics [9–11], has proven especially efficient and permits facile recovery and recycling of the catalyst. In fact, the microemulsion-modified EST system was found to be superior in many respects even to other modern methods in which water is used as solvent (see e.g. Refs. [12–16]). We now find that the EST system is also applicable to transfer-hydrogenation reactions (for some leading reviews and recent articles on this subject see Refs. [16–25]). A convenient way to investigate hydrogen-transfer processes is by studying the disproportionation of dihydroarenes where the hydrogen donors and the acceptors are identical molecules. By this method one can readily find out the fate of the hydrogen abstracted from the donor [26,27]. Except for cases in which the catalyst was a phase-transfer agent, disproportionations were usually performed in organic solvents. In fact, above a certain percentage the presence of water inhibits the reactions or stalls them completely [28]. Under the EST conditions the disproportionation takes place smoothly even when the water content of the reactions is as high as 90%. 2 Experimental 2.1 Instruments NMR spectra were recorded with either a Bruker DRX-400 or a Bruker Advance II-500 in CDCl3. Infrared spectra were obtained with a Bruker Vector 2.2-FRIT instrument. Mass spectral measurements were performed with a Q-TOF-II spectrometer. ICP–MS analyses were carried out with a Perkin-Elmer model ELAN DRC II Apparatus. Gas chromatographic separations were performed on a Hewlett-Packard model Agilent 4890 D by using either a 30m long capillary column packed with Carbowax 20M-poly(ethylene glycol) in fused silica (Supelco 25301-U) or a 15m long column packed with bonded and crosslinked (5% phenyl)methyl polysiloxane (HP-5). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was done with Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope Technai G2 F20 (FEI Company, USA) operated at 200kV and equipped with EDAX-EDS for identification of the elemental composition. Initial powders were dispersed in ethanol and dropped onto a standard 400 mesh carbon coated copper TEM grid. 2.2 Chemicals Tetramethoxysilane (TMOS), n-propyl(trimethoxy)silane, n-octyl(triethoxy)silane, phenyl(triethoxy)silane and 2-chloronaphthalene were obtained from ABCR-Glest Inc. Methyl(trioctyl)ammonium chloride (Aliquat® 336), cetyl(trimethyl)ammonium bromide (CTAB), rhodium trichloride trihydrate, palladium acetate, naphthalene, 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene, 1-phenyl-3-butanone and benzylidene acetone were purchased from the Sigma–Aldrich Chemical Company. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was obtained from Riedel de Haën, and Marlipal® 24/70 (C12–C14 alcohol polyoxyethyleneglycol ethers) from the Sasol Company. The reference compounds 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-methylnaphthalene [29], 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-methylnaphthalene [30], 6-chloro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene [31], 2-(1,1-dimethyethyl)naphthalene [32], 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-(1,1-dimethylethyl)naphthalene [33], 8,9,10,11-tetrahydrobenz[a]anthracene [29] and benz[a]anthracene [29] were prepared according to the respective literature. The tetralone derivatives 3,4-dihydro-7-methyl-1(2H)-naphthalenone [34], 7-chloro-3,4-dihydro-1(2H)naphthalenone [35], 3,4-dihydro-7-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1(2H)naphthalenone [33] and 10,11-dihydro-8(9H)benz[a]anthracenone [36] were likewise prepared according to literature procedures. 2.3 General procedure for the preparation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalenes Typically, to a solution of the respective tetralone derivative (6.8mmol) in MeOH was added gradually solid sodium borohydride (10mmol). The mixture was stirred at room temperature (25°C) until the TLC and IR indicated complete consumption of the starting ketone. The MeOH was evaporated and the residue extracted with dichloromethane (100ml) and water (100ml). The organic phase was dried (MgSO4) and the solvent evaporated. Acetic acid (200ml) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (2ml) were added to the residue. The mixture was refluxed until the entire carbinol disappeared (TLC test). The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, diluted with water (ca. 100ml) and the resulting compound was extracted with dichloromethane (80ml). The organic layer was neutralized with saturated aqueous NaHCO3, washed with water, dried and concentrated. The residue was either distilled under reduced pressure or chromatographed on alumina. 1,2-Dihydronaphthalene [29], 1,2-dihydro-4-methylnaphthalene [29], 1,2-dihydro-6-methylnaphthalene [37], and 10,11-dihydrobenz[a]anthracene [36] were compared with authentic compounds prepared by literature procedures. Data for the new dihydronaphthalenes were as follows: 6-chloro-1,2-dihydronaphthalene was obtained, in 55% overall yield as a colorless liquid; bp 73°C (0.5mm): 1H NMR (400MHz, CDCl3): δ 2.31 (m, 2H), 2.76 (t, 2H, J =8Hz, 2H), 6.09 (dt, 1H, J d =10Hz, J t =8Hz), 6.41 (dt, 1H, J d =10Hz, J t =2Hz), 7.01 (s, 1H), 7.02 (d, 1H, J =8Hz), 7.09 (dd, 2H, J 1 =8Hz, J 2 =2Hz); 13C NMR (100MHz, CDCl3): δ 23.15, 26.86, 125.74, 126.54, 126.93, 128.70, 130.12, 131.90, 133.71, 135.72; GC–Ms: m/z (rel. intensity) 166, 164 (calc.) (49, M+ ), 164 (calc.) 162 [49, (M−1)+], 151, 149 (8, C9H6Cl+), 129 (100, C10H9 +), 128 (59, C10H8 + ). Analysis: found: C, 72.68; H, 5.42; Cl, 21.58%. C10H9Cl requires: C, 72.96; H, 5.50; Cl, 21.54%. 1,2-Dihydro-6-(1,1-dimethylethyl)naphthalene was obtained in 77% overall yield; bp 83°C (0.5mm); 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 1.31 (s, 9H), 2.30 (m, 2H), 2.76 (t, 2H, J =8Hz), 5.99 (dt, 1H, J d =10Hz, J t =8Hz), 6.46 (d, 1H, J =10Hz), 7.03 (d, 1H, J =8Hz), 7.04 (s, 1H), 715 (d, 1H, J =8Hz); 13C NMR (100Hz, CDCl3): δ 23.52, 27.16, 31.57, 34.49, 123.18, 123.86, 127.37, 128.41, 128.51, 130.65, 133.88, 149.43; GC–MS: m/z (rel. intensity) 186 (30, M+ ), 171 (100, C12H15 +), 154 (18, C11H11 +), 141 (12, C11H9 +), 129 (30, C10H9 +), 128 (32, C10H8 + ), 115 (15, C9H7 +). Analysis: found: C, 90.08; H, 9.56%. C14H18 requires: C, 90.26; H, 9.74%. 2.4 Entrapment of the catalysts within hydrophobic sol–gel matrices Typically, a mixture of n-octyl(triethoxy)silane (2.1ml, 6.68mmol), EtOH (5.6ml, 95.9mmol) and triply distilled water (TDW, 0.4ml, 22.2mmol) was stirred magnetically at room temperature for 24h. Separately, tetramethoxysilane (TMOS, 3.6ml, 24.2mmol) in MeOH (2.4ml, 59.3mmol) was hydrolyzed by stirring for 10min with TDW (2.0ml, 111mmol). The mixtures of the two hydrolyzed alkoxysilanes were united and RhCl3·3H2O (30mg, 0.114mmol) and Aliquat 336 (50mg, 0.124mmol) were added. Stirring was continued as long as possible (usually for several days) and the resulting gel was dried at 80°C and 0.5Torr for 24h. The dry ceramic material was sonicated with CH2Cl2 (3×10ml) for 30min and redried at 80°C and 0.5Torr to obtain constant weight of the immobilized complex. The washings, as well as the entrapped catalyst, were subjected to ICP analyses. Immobilization of Pd(OAc)2 (usually 25.6mg, 0.114mmol) by entrapment within different hydrophobic sol–gel matrices was accomplished as previously described [6]. 2.5 Preparation of the emulsions For the preparation of microemulsions (25–35ml) a mixture of the dihydroarene (calculated to fit 0.55wt% of the reaction mixture), TDW (74.92wt%), the required surfactant (2.14wt%) and the co-surfactant n-PrOH (22.39%) was stirred magnetically at 25°C. Occasionally it was necessary to add a few drops of n-PrOH in order to obtain a clear transparent microemulsion. When larger water content was desired the disproportionation reaction was conducted in regular o/w emulsions. Typically, vigorous stirring (>1000rpm) of a mixture of the 1,2-dihydronaphthalene (0.8wt%), sodium dodecylsulfate (3.3wt%), n-propanol (6.6wt%) and TDW (89.3wt%) afforded an emulsion that proved stable for at least one week. 2.6 General procedure for the disproportionation and dehydrogenation of vicinal dihydroarenes To the aforementioned emulsion or the microemulsion was added one half of the immobilized catalyst (containing 0.05–0.06mmol of the free complex). The mixture was heated with stirring at the desired temperature (usually 80°C) for the desired length of time (usually 0.5–3h for the dihydronaphthalene derivatives and 24h for the tetracyclic dihydrobenz[a]anthracene). The ceramic sol–gel material was filtered off and the filtrate treated with NaCl (2g) in TDW (25ml). This caused the reaction mixture to separate into two phases. The organic layer was extracted with hexanes (2×15ml). When the starting material was the dihydrobenz[a]anthracene, benzene was used for the extraction. The product was purified by chromatography on silica gel and analyzed by comparison with authentic samples by TLC, IR, 1H NMR and GC–MS measurements. The used immobilized catalysts were subjected to ICP analyses for determination of the residual rhodium or palladium content, as well as to TEM measurements for analysis of entrapped metallic nanoparticles. After washing the used catalyst with CH2Cl2 (2×10ml) and sonication with the same solvent for 30min, it was dried to constant weight at 80°C and 0.5mm and reused for disproportionation of a fresh portion of a dihydroarene. 2.7 Transfer hydrogenation of benzylidene acetone A stirred microemulsion prepared from 1,2-dihydronaphthalene (546mg, 4.2mmol), benzylidene acetone (200mg, 1.37mmol), SDS (740mg, 2.5mmol), n-PrOH (7.74g, 128mmol) and TDW (25.8g) was heated at 80°C together with sol–gel entrapped Pd(OAc)2 [prepared from 12.8mg of the palladium salt, 1.8ml TMOS and 1.05ml octyl(triethoxy)silane]. After 24h, when the quantity of the starting material did not change anymore, the sol–gel material was filtered off, and to the aqueous filtrate was added solid NaCl (2g). Extraction with CH2Cl2 (2×50ml), drying of the organic solution over MgSO4, removal of the organic solvent and chromatography on silica gel afforded 81mg (40%) of 1-phenyl-3-butanone that proved identical with an authentic sample. 3 Results and discussion Water insoluble 1,2-dihydronaphthalenes were shown to disproportionate into tetralins and naphthalenes in aqueous microemulsions in the presence of either [(C8H17)3NMe][RhCl4] or Pd(OAc)2 entrapped within hydrophobic silica sol–gel. (Scheme 1 ). This reaction is usually accompanied by a dehydrogenation process (Scheme 2 ) which causes the generation of an excess of the fully aromatic product. Both the disproportionation and dehydrogenation can be carried out in regular o/w emulsions that contain up to 90wt% of water or in microemulsions with 70–75wt% of H2O. For technical reasons we chose the microemulsion system for our studies. As surfactants we used the anionic SDS, the cationic CTAB or the non-ionic Marlipal 24/70 together with n-propanol as co-surfactant. (For the effect of the nature of the surfactant vide infra.) The results of some representative experiments with SDS as surfactant are summarized in Table 1 . The Table reveals some significant differences between the rhodium and palladium catalyzed reactions. Except for the disproportionation of the chlorine-containing 1d the palladium catalyst is the more efficient one. While the rhodium catalyst is clearly influenced by the electronic nature of the dihydronapthalenes, such an effect was not observed in the palladium catalyzed reactions. In the first 20min the rates were more or less of the same order of magnitude. Both catalysts are, however, strongly affected by the sterically hindered tert-butyl-substituted substrate, 1e. Since the rate of formation of the tetralins (but not of the naphthalenes) reflects on the dehydrogenation-free disproportionation, we followed its kinetic behavior. The catalytic process by the [(C8H17)3NCH3][RhCl4] ion pair in octylated sol–gel was found to obey the pseudo zero order in the rhodium and the apparent first order rate law in the substrates. From the plots of ln[c] where [c] is the concentration of the substrates, the corresponding rate constants of the disproportionation of 6-methy-6-chloro- and unsubstituted 1,2-dihydronaphthalenbe (1b, 1d and 1a, respectively) in SDS-based aqueous microemulsion were 0.0235, 0.051 and 0.0716s−1 at 80°C. Using the σ p values reported by Matsui et al. [38] these data can even be expressed as a Hammett plot with a ρ value of −1.6. The rate constant for the 6-tert-butyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene (1e) of 0.0129s−1 does not fit on this plot. We rationalize this fact by the limited ability of 1e to penetrate the sol–gel material through its small pores of ca. 21Å. (For the pore size of [(C8H17)3NCH3][RhCl4]-encaged silica sol–gel see Ref. [7]). A strong dependence of the rate on the size of the substrate has also been demonstrated by using the four-cyclic substrates 10,11-dihydrobenz[a]anthracene (4), which requires 24h for complete disproportionation into benz[a]anthracene and 9,10,11,12-tetrahydrobenz[a]anthracene. On the other hand, 1,3-cyclohexadiene is completely disproportionated under these conditions within 20min. We recall that the dependence of the disproportionation of dihydroarenes on the size of the substrate has also been observed in organic solvents [27,29]. The disproportionation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalenes by the immobilized [(C8H17)3NCH3][RhCl4] catalyst differs from the reaction by heterogenized Pd(OAc)2 also by the fact that the palladium-promoted process neither follows the first order rate law equation nor does it obey the second order rule. Similar differences have already been observed when we compared the kinetics of the disproportionation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene by the sol–gel entrapped RhCl3–Aliquat 336 catalyst and by the Dowex® 1-bound RhCl3 in organic solvents (Cf. [26] and [29]). Two further factors were found to significantly influence the reactions in aqueous microemulsion: the nature of the surfactant and the hydrophobicity of the silica sol–gel support. Replacement of the SDS surfactant in entries 1 and 4 in Table 2 by the cationic CTAB resulted in significant reduction in the formation of 2a and 3a. On the other hand, the use of the non-ionic Marlipal 24/70 increased the rate in the rhodium-catalyzed reaction, leading to quantitative conversion of 1a after 30min at 80°C (see Table 2). This order of the surfactant effect differs from the one observed in the double bond isomerization of allylarenes by immobilized [(C8H17)3NCH3][RhCl4] in water [7] as well as from that of the Heck coupling of bromoarenes with styrene in aqueous microemulsions [39]. Thus, the most efficient disproportionation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalenes takes place by the rhodium precatalyst in the presence of the non-ionic surfactant or by the heterogenized Pd(OAc)2 together with the anionic SDS. The reason for this order of the surfactant effect is still obscure. The influence of the hydrophobicity of the sol–gel support on the disproportionation and dehydrogenation by the heterogenized rhodium precatalyst could not be investigated because, unlike in the isomerization of allylbenzenes, the rhodium compound leached from the modified sol–gel matrix in the presence of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene. Only when the ceramic support was prepared from 95% TMOS and 5% octyl(triethoxy)silane, ICP analysis revealed that the leaching stopped. We were, however, able to study the influence of the hydrophobicity by phenylated, octylated and propylated sol–gel on the disproportionation by heterogenized Pd(OAc)2. Typical results are summarized in Table 3 . Because of the significant rate increase by hydrophobicitization of the sol–gel support with phenyl groups, we decreased the temperature of the comparative experiments to 72°C. As in some other catalytic reactions in aqueous microemulsion [7,39], the application of non-hydrophobicitized sol–gel (i.e. prepared from TMOS alone) gave rather unsatisfactory results (Cf., e.g. entries 1 and 4 in Table 3). However, in contrast to the double bond migration by our rhodium catalyst that reacted best in propylated sol–gel and gave low results in the phenylated matrix, the disproportionation and dehydrogenation revealed an opposite order. Thus, the best, and the worst results were in the phenylated and propylated sol–gel, respectively. Both the entrapped rhodium and palladium catalysts could be successfully recycled. In fact, their activity increases slightly after 1–2 runs owing to the enlargement of the sol–gel pores caused by hydrolysis of some Si–O bonds in the aqueous medium. The results of two representative sets of experiments in which 1a reacted in the presence of either the rhodium or the palladium catalyst in five consecutive runs are shown in Table 4 . After the sixth or seventh run the Si–O bond breaking leads to gradual collapse of the sol–gel texture which causes destruction of the supported catalyst. During the immobilization process and during the disproportionation–dehydrogenation reactions in microemulsions both the rhodium and palladium precatalysts are converted into sol–gel stabilized metallic nanoparticles of 2–5nm in size as well as a few larger aggregates. The nanoparticles were found to resemble those obtained from the same organometallic precursors in double bond migration and C–C coupling processes, and that were already characterized by TEM and XPS studies [7,40]. Although we did not notice participation of the water in our previous catalytic studies under the EST conditions [3–7], we found now some H–D exchange in the products when D2O was used instead of H2O. Using the RhCl3–Aliquat 336 in D2O, we observed that under the conditions of Table 1, 4% monodeuteriated naphthalenes and 19% of monodeuteriated tetralins were formed within 3h. (Cf., the extensive H–D exchange by the sol–gel-free rhodium catalyst in organic solvents [41]). The palladium catalyst led already, after 90min, to 4% of the monodeuteriated naphthalene as well as of the deuteriated tetralin. Finally, we wish to draw the attention to the fact that the vicinal hydrocarbons act as hydrogen donors in microemulsion not only to acceptors of identical structures (i.e. as disproportionation reagents) but also as donors to other acceptors. An example for transfer hydrogenation of benzylidene acetone is given in Section 2. 4 Conclusions Transfer-hydrogenation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalenes, in which the hydrogen donor and the acceptor are identical molecules results in disproportionation of the dihydroarenes to give tetralin and naphthalene derivatives. In the presence of either sol–gel entrapped Pd(OAc)2 or similarly heterogenized [(C8H17)3NCH3][RhCl4] the disproportionation can be carried out either in o/w emulsions or in microemulsions. The reactions are coupled with a slow dehydrogenation process. Best results are obtained when the palladium catalyst is encaged within phenylated silica sol–gel and the rhodium catalyst is entrapped within an octylated support. Unlike some other reactions that were performed in aqueous microemulsion (see Ref. [7]) the best surfactant for the rhodium catalyzed disproportionation is the non-ionic Marlipal 24/70. While the rhodium catalyzed disproportionation follows the pseudo first order rate law and is strongly influenced by the electronic nature of the substituents on the dihydroarene, the palladium promoted reactions are only slightly affected by the electronic factor. Since the micelle containing substrates have to penetrate the small pores of the sol–gel material (21–35nm) in order to reach the catalysts, the size of the reactants has a substantial effect on the rate. Since we have shown previously that within octylated silica sol–gel [(C8H17)3NCH3][RhCl4] is transformed into catalytically active recyclable nanoparticles in aqueous microemulsions, but not in dry non-polar organic solvents, and we have found in the present study that nanoparticles from the same catalyst precursor are generated equally well both in organic and aqueous media, we conclude that the formation of the metallic particles may also be associated with the nature of the reactants employed.

        "dc:description": "In the course of our attempts to replace the traditional, but harmful, organic solvents in synthetic processes by environmentally favored benign media, we studied the disproportionation of hydrophobic vicinal dihydroarenes in water. This reaction takes place efficiently by either sol–gel-entrapped [(C8H17)3NCH3][RhCl4] ion pair or by immobilized Pd(OAc)2, together with a suitable surfactant to give tetrahydroarenes and fully aromatic products. Since a slow dehydrogenation process accompanies this process the latter products are usually formed in excess. The reactions are also accompanied by transformation of the heterogenized catalysts into sol–gel-stabilized metallic particles, which can be recycled without loss of activity for at least five runs. The rhodium (but not the palladium) promoted disproportionations that follow the pseudo first order rate law. The reactions are influenced by both the electronic and steric structures of the dihydroarenes, as well as by the nature of the surfactant and by the hydrophobicity of the ceramic sol–gel support. Deuterio-labeling indicates slight involvement of the water in the disproportionation process.",
