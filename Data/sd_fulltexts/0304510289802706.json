Modifi- cation by alkaline earth metal oxides enhanced the formation of alcohols in the order: Mg ^ Ca < Sr < Ba. A maximum selectivity as high as 60% for oxygenated compounds was observed at a Ba:Co mole ratio of 1.5 - 2.2. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies of these catalysts show that Co2(CO)g supported on SiOa changes to 4(00)12 in vacuo, and then to highly dispersed cobalt metal when heated in a stream of hydrogen at 673 K. High-pressure in situ FT-IR studies show that the formation of alcohols may be related to the presence of bridged-CO species on the surface of the catalysts. Introduction Direct synthesis of alcohols from syngas has been developed as one of the most promising processes for producing fuels and raw chemicals [1,2]. Rhodium catalysts have been studied intensively, and some high-performance catalysts for the synthesis of Cg-oxygenated compounds (Cg 0) such as ethanol, acetaldehyde and acetic acid have already been developed in vapor- phase CO hydrogenation [3-5]. However, only a few reports have been presented for non-rhodium catalysts such as molybdenum [6], iron [7-9] and cobalt [10-16]. We have reported previously that cobalt catalysts doubly modified with transition metals and alkaline earth metal oxides are effective for ethanol synthesis [16 - 20]. We have shown that highly dispersed cobalt metal on these catalysts is effective in the formation of oxygenated compounds (C 0) in CO hydrogenation. 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 362 Supported transition metal carbonyl clusters are attractive from the viewpoint of catalysis chemistry both because of the high dispersion of assemblies of metal atoms on inorganic supports as well as in connection with the relationships between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis [21 - 24]. Recently, we have shown that Co/SiOg catalysts prepared from Co2(Co)g are highly active for alcohol production without the addition of transition metals [25]. Here, we report on the activities and active species on the catalysts in CO hydrogenation as well as the modifying effects induced by alkaline earth metal oxides. Experimental Catalyst preparation Silica-supported cobalt catalysts [Co(CO)/Si02] were prepared by im- pregnation of 002(00)3 from its hexane solution under a deoxygenated atmosphere. Before impregnation of 002(00)3, alkaline earth metal oxides were supported on the silica by impregnation from an aqueous solution of the alkaline earth metal acetate followed by calcination in a stream of hydrogen at 623 K. The prepared catalysts were further treated in a hydro- gen stream at 673 K prior to use. Syngas reactions The CO hydrogenation was carried out at a syngas pressure of 2.1 MPa using a CO:H2:Ar mole ratio of 3:6:1 and employing a fixed-bed type flow reactor made of 316 stainless steel with a glass insert to avoid contamina- tion of the catalyst by the steel wall under the reaction conditions. Argon was included in the syngas to provide an internal standard. After the reaction had reached a stationary state, the effluent gas was analyzed directly by gas chromatography using five columns, viz. PEG-6000, PEG- 1500, molecular sieve 5A, Porapak QS and Chromosorb 101. Product selec- tivities were determined from the carbon efficiencies based on the amount of CO reacted. Characterization of catalysts X-Ray diffraction measurement of the catalysts was carried out by using a Philips PW-1700 spectrometer employing nickel-filtered CuK radiation. The distances and the coordination numbers of the Co Co and Co 0 bondings in the catalyst were determined by analysis of the Co K-edge EXAFS data obtained using the EXAFS facilities at BL-10B of the Photon Factory in the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics. The EXAFS spectra of the catalysts were measured using a specially designed quartz cell with CAPTON windows in which the catalysts were prepared under a nitrogen atmosphere [26]. The measured EXAFS spectra of standard samples of Co2(CO)g powder and cobalt foil were obtained with samples sealed in a 363 polyethylene bag under a nitrogen atmosphere. The phase shift effect was not corrected in the Fourier transform of the EXAFS data. High-pressure in situ FT-IR spectra were recorded using a JEOL JIR- 100 FT-IR spectrometer. The recording conditions employed have been de- scribed elsewhere [27]. Results and discussion Activities and selectivities of the silica-supported cobalt catalysts in CO hydrogenation Table 1 lists the activities of the catalysts in CO hydrogenation. The silica-supported cobalt catalyst [Co(CO)/Si02] prepared from Co2(CO)g was considerably more active than catalysts prepared from cobalt(II) acetate, nitrate and chloride. This Co(CO)/Si02 catalyst gave C 0 values (including Ci to Cg alcohols) which indicated greater than 20% selectivity with 80% formation of hydrocarbons in the syngas reaction. However, silica-supported cobalt catalysts prepared from other precursors were virtually inactive with respect to the formation of C 0. This is the first example of the formation of C 0 by a cobalt catalyst in the absence of a promoter. The formation of C 0 was increased by modifying the Co(CO)/Si02 catalyst with alkaline earth metal oxides. The selectivity for C 0 increased through addition of alkaline earth metal oxides in the order: none < Mg < Ca < Sr ^ Ba, whereas the activities decreased in the reverse order. In addition, little CO^ was formed over such cobalt catalysts. This result means that the water-gas shift reaction is negligible in the presence of these catalysts. The catalytic performance was greatly influenced by the amount of alkaline earth oxide present. Figure 1 depicts the effect of barium addition on CO hydrogenation. On measuring the amount of barium present the activity of the catalyst decreased, whereas the formation of C 0 increased. A maximum selectivity as high as 60% was observed at a Ba:Co mole ratio of 1.5 - 2.2. Further addition of barium decreased the formation of C 0. Ethanol was the principal product in the C 0 obtained over such cobalt catalysts. A similar effect regarding an improvement in the selectivities for C 0 by addition of alkaline earth metal oxides was observed with cobalt catalysts modified by transition metals [15-17]. Such C 0 were considered to be formed via the corresponding aldehydes, since aldehydes were observed during the reactions. As shown in Fig. 2, the Ca fraction of C 0 deviated significantly above the line in the Schultz-Flory plot [28], whereas that for hydrocarbons lay below the line. However, the total product distribution satisfies the Schultz-Flory conditions. These results indicate that alcohols and hydrocarbons were generated via common intermediates, probably acyl-cobalt complexes. The elimination of acetaldehyde predominated over TABLE 1 Hydrogenation of carbon monoxide on silica-supported cobalt catalysts\" Catalyst1' Cobalt precursor M/Co0 Reaction CO conversion Product selectivities (%) (mole ratio) temperature (%) (K) c^-o\" c fy1 HC0 cOa Co Co Co Co Co-Mg Co-Ca Co-Sr Co-Ba Co(N03)i,-6H;,0 CoCla-eHaO Co(OAc);;-4HsiO Co2(CO)s Co2(CO)g Co2(CO)g Co2(CO)g Co2(CO) 2.4 1.6 2.5 2.2 493 623 523 493 493 623 523 523 5.9 0.5 1.7 10.0 6.8 9.9 5.7 4.2 2 0 1 5 6 17 27 27 2 0 1 20 23 35 47 48 96 74 86 78 76 63 49 46 2 26 13 2 1 2 4 6 Reaction conditions: CO:H;;:Ar= 3:6:1; pressure, 2.1 MPa; GHSV 2000h-1.

Similar deviations of Cg components in Schultz-Flory plots have been observed with cobalt catalysts prepared from cobalt acetate modified by rhenium or ruthenium [16,19]. These results support the suggestion that the active sites for CO hydrogenation over cobalt catalysts prepared from Co2(CO)g are also located on the cobalt metal as previously discussed. Oxygenated compounds are also produced by the homogeneous hydro- genation of CO catalyzed by 2(00)3 [29, 30]. It has been proposed that methanoi was formed from a hydroxymethyl complex intermediate, (00)3 ^CoCHzOH, and that higher alcohols were formed via the homologa- tion of methanoi in the homogeneous catalyst system. With the heteroge- neous cobalt catalysts described in this report, it is considered that the growth of the hydroxymethyl intermediate formed on the surface of the cobalt metal particles leads to the generation of ethanol and higher alcohols in the presence of the catalyst since the yield of methanoi is much less than that of ethanol. However, further investigations are required to clarify the mechanism of formation of oxygenated compounds. Characterization of catalysts by XRD and EXAFS Silica-supported cobalt catalysts prepared from nitrate or chloride pre- cursors are relatively stable in air. However, the cobalt catalyst prepared from Co2(CO)g is highly air-sensitive. On exposure to air, the black Co(CO)/ SiOg catalyst treated in a stream of hydrogen is immediately changed to blue by oxidation of the cobalt metal. Modification of the catalysts with alkaline earth metal oxide leads to increasing air-sensitivity. For these various rea- sons, careful deoxygenation of atmospheric gases such as hydrogen and nitrogen is required in the preparation and handling of these catalysts. No peaks were observed in the XRD patterns of the silica-supported cobalt catalysts prepared from Co2(CO)g. However, the cobalt catalyst pre- pared from cobalt(II) chloride gave sharp peaks corresponding to cobalt metal particles of ca. 20 run crystalline size as described in a previous paper [31]. These results indicate that the cobalt metal in catalysts prepared from Co2(CO)g is present as very fine particles on a silica support. In order to clarify the changes occurring in the structure of the cobalt species, we have undertaken EXAFS analyses of the cobalt catalysts. Figure 3 shows the A ^weighted Fourier transforms of EXAFS data extracted from the absorption spectra of Co2(CO)g powder, cobalt foil and cobalt catalysts prepared from Co2(CO)g. The peaks at 2.55 x 10~1 and 2.10 x 10~1 nm in the Fourier transform of Co2(CO)g may be associated with Co Co and Co C bonds, respectively. The peak at 1.42 x 10\"1 nm is associated with Co 0 bondings of the partially oxidized Co2(CO)g arising during the experiment. When Co2(CO)g was supported on Si02 or Sr/SiOg, its color changed from orange to dark brown. The similarity among the Fourier transforms for these catalysts and that for Co2(CO)g indicates the presence of 4(00)12 species on these catalysts as described by Iwasawa and Yamada [32]. 367 Distance / 10 nn Fig. 3.

Catalysts: Co(CO) (5wt.%)/SiC 2; Co(CO) (6wt.%)-Sr (7.5wt.%)/SiOsi. On activation of these catalysts at 673 K in a stream of hydrogen, their color changed to black. Peaks of 2.14 xlO-1! for Co(CO)/Si02 and at 2.12 x lO\"1 nm for Co(CO)-Sr/Si02 in the Fourier transforms may be linked with Co Co bondings in the cobalt metal. These bond distances are shorter than those in cobalt foil (2.16 x lO\"1!!]!!). Such differences in the Co Co distances in cobalt metal between the catalysts and cobalt foil are greater than experimental error, and indicate that the cobalt metal particles are highly dispersed on the catalysts in a similar manner to the situation existing in fine nickel particles [33]. The particle sizes of cobalt metal increase in the order: Co(CO)-Sr/Si02 < Co(CO)/Si02 < (cobalt foil). The peak amplitudes of the nearest Co Co bonding in these catalysts are much lower than that in cobalt foil. The coordination numbers of cobalt atom of catalysts are esti- mated from the amplitude of the peaks to be 2.6. By assuming that the structure of the cobalt metal on the catalysts is similar to that of cobalt foil, the particles sizes of the cobalt metal on the catalysts may be determined as ca. l nm [34]. Peaks corresponding to the second greater nearest-neighbour Co Co bondings were not observed in the Fourier transforms of the cata- 368 lysts, also confirming that the cobalt metal is highly dispersed on the catalysts. The Fourier transforms for these catalysts exhibit an additional peak at 1.68 xlO-1 ! for Co(CO)/Si02 and at l^xlO-inm for Co(CO)-Sr/Si02 which may be accepted as due to Co 0 bonding. Despite careful deoxygena- tion of the hydrogen gas employed, this peak was inevitably observed. Cobalt metal on Co(CO)/Si02 and Co(CO)-Sr/Si02 catalysts is readily oxidized on exposure to air as described above. The cobalt oxide thus formed on the catalysts is highly stable to 1073 K in a hydrogen atmosphere. Moreover, these oxidized cobalt materials produce no peak in the XRD spectra, suggesting that the cobalt oxide is highly dispersed on the catalysts. The Co 0 bonding distances in the Fourier transforms of the oxidized Co(CO)/Si02 and Co(CO)-Sr/Si02 catalysts are 1.59 x 10-1 and 1.57 x 10-1 nm, respectively. These distances are much shorter than the Co-0 bondings observed with cobalt catalysts treated in a stream of hydrogen. Indeed the profiles of the Fourier transforms and the Co 0 bonding distances for the oxidized cobalt catalysts are substantially different from those of standard samples of cobalt oxides such as CoO, 203 and 00304. Asakura et al. have employed EXAFS to investigate the structure of aluminum-supported cobalt oxide prepared from Co2(CO)g, and have shown that the divalent cobalt atoms in such material were supported on aluminum through Co 0 Al bondings such as Co\" (0 Al )2[35]. The Fourier transform of the alu- minum-supported cobalt oxide showed a similar profile and Co 0 bonding distance to those for the oxidized cobalt catalysts observed in this study. High-pressure in situ FT-IR study of adsorbed species on the catalysts Figure 4 depicts the FT-IR spectra of CO adsorbed on the various cobalt catalysts under the reaction conditions employed. Both linear-CO (1-CO, 2056 cm\"1) and bridged-CO (b-CO, 1946 and 1815 cm\"1) species were observed on the Co(CO)-Ba/Si02 catalyst which gave oxygenated compounds in high selectivity. The band at 1578 cm\"1 may be reasonably assigned to CO2 adsorbed on the catalyst. The band at 1726 cm\" t can be assigned either to a monodentate acetate formed during CO hydrogenation or to CO adsorbed in a bidentate fashion on both the barium and cobalt atoms in a similar manner to that proposed for rhodium catalysts by Ichikawa and Fukuoka [36]. Linear-CO species predominate on Co(CO)/Si02 and Co(CO)-Mg/Si02 catalysts which gave hydrocarbons as the principal products. These results indicate that strongly adsorbed bridged-CO species play an important role in the formation of oxygenated compounds. Similar results have been observed in CO hydrogenation catalyzed by a cobalt catalyst doubly modified with rhenium and strontium prepared from cobalt(II) acetate [37]. As described in previous papers [16-20], silica-supported cobalt cata- lysts prepared from cobalt(II) acetate and doubly modified by alkaline earth metal oxide and transition metals such as rhenium and ruthenium are highly effective for the formation of ethanol in CO hydrogenation. Highly dispersed cobalt metal provided the active site for the formation of C 0 by these 369 Wavenumber /cm Fig. 4.

Transition metals are considered to improve the dispersion of cobalt metal during reduction of the catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere. The cobalt species from Co2(CO)g supported on silica readily give highly dispersed cobalt metal in a stream of hydrogen. As described above, C 0 compounds are formed on such highly dispersed cobalt metal even in the absence of transition metal promoters. The activities of heterogeneous cobalt catalysts prepared from Co2(CO)g differ considerably in CO hydrogenation from those of the conventional catalysts prepared from cobalt(II) nitrate or chloride. These differences may be attributed mainly to the different extents of cobalt metal dispersion on these catalysts. However, the highly dispersed cobalt metal on cobalt catalysts prepared from Co2(CO)g is readily oxidized to a stable cobalt oxide on exposure to air. This cobalt oxide is virtually inactive toward CO hydrogenation. Acknowledgements Part of this work was carried out under the support of the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (KEK).

Modification by alkaline earth metal oxides enhanced the formation of alcohols in the order: Mg ⪡ Ca < Sr ⩽ Ba. A maximum selectivity as high as 60% for oxygenated compounds was observed at a Ba:Co mole ratio of 1.5 – 2.2. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies of these catalysts show that Co2(CO)2 supported on SiO2 changes to Co4(CO)12 in vacuo, and then to highly dispersed cobalt metal when heated in a stream of hydrogen at 673 K. High-pressure in situ FT-IR studies show that the formation of alcohols may be related to the presence of bridged-CO species on the surface of the catalysts. References 1 R.B.
