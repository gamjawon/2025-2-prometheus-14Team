Graphical abstract HClO4-SiO2 provides a simple, efficient, rapid and environmentally benign route for the synthesis of 14-aryl or alkyl-14-H-dibenzo[a,j]xanthenes. Silica supported perchloric acid (HClO4-SiO2) is found to be a recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for a rapid and efficient synthesis of various 14-aryl or alkyl-14-H-dibenzo[a,j]xanthenes with good to excellent yields under reflux and solvent free conditions. The catalyst is easily prepared, stable, reusable and efficient under the reaction conditions. Keywords Xanthenes Solvent-free Heterogeneous catalyst Silica supported perchloric acid 1 Introduction Xanthenes and benzoxanthenes are biologically important drug intermediates. They are cited as active oxygen heterocycles possessing antibacterial [1], anti-inflammatory [2], and antiviral properties [3]. These compounds are also utilized as antagonists for paralyzing action of zoxazolamine [4] and in photodynamic therapy [5]. The other useful applications of these heterocycles are as dyes [6], fluorescent materials for visualization of biomolecules [7] and in laser technologies [8]. Several polycyclic compounds containing xanthene skeleton are isolated from natural sources [9]. Xanthenes and benzoxanthenes are prepared by different methods including the reaction of aryloxymagnesium halides with triethylorthoformate [10], cyclodehydration [11], trapping of benzynes by phenols [12], intramolecular phenyl carbonyl coupling reactions of benzaldehydes and acetophenones [13], cyclization of polycyclic aryltriflate esters [14] and cyclocondensation between 2-hydroxy aromatic aldehydes and 2-tetralone [15], Furthermore, 14-H-dibenzo [a,j]xanthenes and its analogues are prepared by reaction of 2-naphthol with 2-naphthol-1-methanol [16], formamide [17], CO [18], and aldehydes [19–26]. Many of these methods, however, suffer from longer reaction times, unsatisfactory yields, harsh reaction conditions and excessive use of reagents and catalysts. It is therefore important to find more convenient methods for the preparation of these compounds. Heterogeneous catalysts have gained interesting attraction in recent years due to economic and environmental considerations. These catalysts are generally inexpensive and easily available. They can conveniently be handled and removed from the reaction mixture, thus making the experimental procedure simple and eco-friendly. The leading contenders for environmentally acceptable processes are supported reagents. Use of silica-supported reagents in one-pot multi-component construction of heterocycles has received considerable importance in organic synthesis [27]. In particular, perchloric acid adsorbed on silica gel (HClO4/SiO2) [28] has immerged as an extremely useful catalyst in various organic transformations, including acylation of alcohols [28], acylation of aldehydes [29], 1,3-dithiolane/dithiane formation [30], tetrahydropyranylation [31], thio-acetalization [31], Ferrier rearrangement [32], Michael addition [33], cleavage of ketals and benzylidene acetals [34], the Hantzsch condensation [35], Synthesis of bis-indolylmethanes [36], glycosylation of sugars [37] and N-tert-butoxycarbonylation of amines [38], synthesis of tetrasubstituted imidazoles [39] and synthesis of poly-substituted quinolines [40]. In view of its inherent properties like environmental compatibility, greater selectivity, operational simplicity, moisture-insensitive, less noncorrosive nature and ease of isolation, it is therefore, interest to us to find out the behavior of the reagent system, HClO4 supported on silica gel (230–400 mesh) in the synthesis of xanthene derivatives. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the use of perchloric acid adsorbed on silica gel (HClO4/SiO2), for the synthesis of 14-aryl or alkyl-14-H-dibenzo[a,j]xanthenes. In continuation of our work on the development of efficient protocols for the synthesis of xanthene [41], an intermediate for the preparation of an antibacterial drug and in view of importance of heterogeneous acid catalysts in organic synthesis, we now wish to report perchloric acid adsorbed on silica gel (HClO4/SiO2) catalyzed highly efficient synthesis of 14-aryl or alkyl-14-H-dibenzo[a,j]xanthenes using one-pot condensation of 2-naphtol with wide variety of aldehydes under solvent free and reflux conditions (Scheme 1 ). 2 Results and discussion HClO4-SiO2 was prepared according to the literature procedure [28]. In order to determine the most appropriate reaction conditions and evaluate the catalytic efficiency of HClO4-SiO2 catalyst, initially a model study was carried out on the synthesis of 3a (Scheme 1). Among the tested solvents such as methanol, ethanol, DMF, CH3CN, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane and solvent-free system, condensation of benzaldehyde and 2-naphthol was more facile and proceeded to gave highest yield, under solvent free conditions (Table 1 ). Interestingly, it was found to be HClO4 supported on silica gel with low loading (0.025mmol/50mg. 1mol%) is an efficient catalyst and gave exclusively 3a in 95% yield in 10min under solvent free conditions. In order to evaluate the generality of the process, several diversified examples illustrating the present method for the synthesis of 14-aryl or alkyl-14-H-dibenzo[a,j]xanthenes 3 was studied (Table 2 ). The reaction of 2-naphthol with various aromatic aldehydes bearing electron withdrawing groups (such as nitro, halide) or electron releasing groups (such as methyl, methoxy) and aliphatic aldehydes was carried out in the presence of HClO4-SiO2 as catalyst. The yields obtained were good to excellent without formation of any side products. The reaction worked well with aromatic (entries 1–10, Table 2) as well as aliphatic aldehydes (entries 12–14, Table 2), giving various xanthene derivatives in 86–98% yields. All the products obtained were characterized by spectroscopic methods such as IR, 1H NMR, for unknown compound (13C NMR and analytical data) and also by comparison with the reported spectral data and melting point. Concerning the reaction mechanism, we proposed that a carbocation is initially formed; aryl- or alkyl-methanebisnaphthols are then formed in the second step, which then undergo dehydration to give the final product which is similar to the literature reports [25] (Fig. 1 ). Table 3 , compares our results (time, yield, reaction conditions) with results obtained by other groups. As can be seen, our method is simpler, more efficient, and uses no toxic solvents. 2.1 Reusability of catalyst Next, we investigated the reusability and recycling of HClO4-SiO2. At first, we put p-bromobenzaldehyde, 2-naphthol and 0.01mmol HClO4-SiO2 in 1,2-dichloroethane together, and then the mixture was refluxed. When the reaction was completed, the catalyst was separated by simple filtration and recovered HClO4-SiO2 was reused in subsequent reactions without significant decrease in activity even after five runs (Table 4 ). The simplicity, together with the use of inexpensive, non-toxic and environmentally benign nature of HClO4-SiO2 catalyst under solvent free condition is other remarkable feature of the procedure. Chloroform was added to the reaction mixture, the catalyst was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated to give crude residue, which was crystallized in ethanol to give pure 14-aryl or alkyl-14-H-dibenzo[a,j]xanthenes 3 in excellent yields. 3 Conclusion We described herein perchloric acid adsorbed on silica gel (HClO4-SiO2) catalyzed highly efficient, one-pot, protocol for the synthesis of 14-aryl or alkyl-14-H-dibenzo[a,j]xanthenes by the condensation of an aldehyde and 2-naphthol under solvent free and reflux conditions in excellent yields. The remarkable catalytic activity of HClO4-SiO2 exhibited is convincingly superior to the recently reported other catalytic methods with respect to reaction time (8–20min in solvent free condition), amount of catalyst and the pure products were obtained by simple crystallization. Easy work up, inexpensive, ready availability of the catalyst makes the procedure an attractive alternative to the existing methods for the synthesis of xanthenes 3a–n. 4 Experimental The products (3a–n) were isolated and characterized by physical and spectral data. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance-300MHz spectrometers with 7–10mM solutions in CDCl3 in the presence of tetramethylsilane as internal standard. IR spectra were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer 843 spectrometer with KBr plates. Melting points were determined on Electro thermal 9100, and are not corrected. 4.1 Preparation of HClO4/SiO2 catalyst 70% aqueous perchloric acid (1.8g, 12.5mmol) was added to a suspension of SiO2 (230–400 mesh, 23.7g) in ether (70ml). The mixture was concentrated and the residue was heated at 100°C for 72h under vacuum to give HClO4-SiO2 (0.5mmol/g) as free flowing powder (50mg=0.025mmol of HClO4). 4.2 General experimental procedure (Method A) A mixture of an aldehyde (1mmol), 2-naphtol (2mmol) and HClO4-SiO2 (20mg, 0.01mmol, 1mol%) in 1,2-dichloroethane (10ml) was stirred at reflux for appropriate time according to Table 2. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was filtrated and the organic solvent was concentrated in vacuum to afford crude product. The crystalline pure product was obtained by further recrystalization from ethanol. 4.3 General experimental procedure (Method B) To a mixture of aldehyde (1mmol), 2-naphtol (2mmol) and HClO4-SiO2 (20mg, 0.01mmol, 1mol%) were heated at 125°C with stirring for appropriate time according to Table 2. After completion of reaction (monitored by TLC) the mixture was cooled to room temperature, CHCl3 (15ml) was added. The catalyst was filtered, solid was washed with CHCl3 (5ml), combined CHCl3 solution was concentrated in vacuum to afford crude product. The crystalline pure product was obtained by further recrystalization from ethanol. The spectral (IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR) and analytical data for the unknown compounds are presented below: Compound 3k.
