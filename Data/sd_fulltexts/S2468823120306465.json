Graphical abstract Due to the intermolecular charge transfer, fullerene and single-walled carbon nanotube composite exhibits excellent activity for oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution as metal-free multifunctional electrocatalyst. The fullerene and single-walled carbon nanotube composite (C60-SWCNT) is experimentally investigated to have multifunctional catalytic activities for the oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution, however the mechanisms and the origin of activities are not clear at the molecular level. In this paper, by applying the density functional theory method, a highly active site of C60-SWCNT is identified (named as site-2). The oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution on the site-2 both can be completed through the four-electron reaction pathway and the corresponding overpotentials are 0.58 V and 0.62 V for them, respectively. Furthermore, the hydrogen adsorption free energy is calculated to be a small value of 0.39 eV, also indicating the high hydrogen evolution activity of the site-2. These calculation results are consistent with the experimental determinations. The source of the excellent activities of the C60-SWCNT composite should be attributed to the intermolecular charge transfer from the SWCNT to the C60, which leads to the increased positive charges of the site-2 in the C60-SWCNT. Therefore, the activity of the C60-SWCNT is enhanced and the binding of the reaction species is further improved. Keywords Multifunctional electrocatalyst Oxygen reduction Oxygen evolution Hydrogen evolution Density functional theory 1 Introduction The energy crisis induced by the excessive use of fossil fuels has forced researchers to conduct investigate on clean energies such as nuclear energy [1], shale gas [2], hydrogen energy [3], and solar energy [4,5] extensively. For hydrogen energy, the development of sustainable energy conversion technology like fuel cells [6–9] and water splitting systems [10,11] are very important for the production or utilization of such clean energy source. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are the core reactions of fuel cells and water splitting systems [12–14]. These three reactions have the disadvantages of sluggish kinetics and high overpotential, which need effective catalysts to overcome these defects [15–17]. Noble metal-based materials (like Pt, Ru, and Ir) as efficient ORR, OER, and HER catalysts have disadvantages of high cost, low abundance, and limited durability [18–21]. Hence, it is of great significance to exploit economical and high activity catalysts to substitute noble metal-based catalysts [22–24]. Carbon-based materials are promising substitutes to noble metal-based catalysts due to their low price, abundant reserves, and long-term stability [25,26]. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as one-dimensional carbon materials, have attracted widespread attention in many fields [27–29]. CNTs are suitable for loading other active components to construct functional composites for the ORR, OER, and HER [30–32] due to their unique mesoporous skeletons. Wang et al. reported that poly (diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) functionalized/adsorbed CNTs catalysts exhibit excellent fuel selectivity and long-term durability [33]. The prominent ORR catalytic performance of the PDDA adsorbed vertically aligned CNT electrode is comparable to traditional Pt/C electrode. Furthermore, a hollow bimetallic carbide/nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (Co6Mo6C2@NCNT) was prepared by Feng et al., exhibiting trifunctional catalytic activities for the ORR, OER, and HER [34]. The abundant active sites, large surface area, and the synergy between N-doped CNT and Co6Mo6C2 lead to its excellent catalytic activity. Fullerenes, as another kind of carbon materials, have promising properties of high electron affinity and large surface area [35,36]. In recent years, investigations on doped fullerenes and endohedral metallofullerenes for the ORR, OER, and HER have also been reported [37–39]. Most recently, Gao et al. synthesized a composite material by adsorbing C60 onto single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) which possess high multifunctional catalytic activities for the ORR, OER, and HER in wide pH range [40]. The active sites of the C60-SWCNT composite catalyst are introduced by the intermolecular charge transfer, which is different from the traditional carbon-based catalysts through the intramolecular charge transfer between original structures and doping atoms [41–43]. However, the inherent catalytic mechanisms and the origin of the high activity of C60-SWCNT are unclear. In this work, a model of C60-SWCNT composite structure is constructed and the detailed mechanisms of the ORR, OER, and HER are investigated by density functional theory (DFT) method. The binding energies of the reaction intermediates (*OOH, *O, and *OH) and the Gibbs free energy of the each step are calculated. The results reveal that the carbon atom on the C60 nearest to the SWCNT is highly active for the C60-SWCNT, which can catalyze four-electron reaction path for the ORR and OER. The origin of the catalytic activity is also explored by analyzing the Mulliken charge distributions. 2 Computational details All spin unrestricted DFT calculations were implemented by utilizing the DMol3 program [44,45]. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (BLYP) was employed to describe the exchange-correlation effects [46]. The double numerical plus polarization (DNP) basis set with the effective core potentials (ECPs) were utilized for all calculations. The convergence tolerance for energy change, max force, and max displacement were 2.0 × 10−5 Ha, 0.004 Ha Å−1, and 0.005 Å, respectively. To evaluate the stability of C60-SWCNT, the formation energy (E f) is calculated and defined as E f = E C60-SWCNT − E SWCNT − E C60, where E C60-SWCNT, E SWCNT, and E C60 are the total energies of the C60-SWCNT, SWCNT, and C60, respectively. The binding energies of the adsorbed species (ΔE species) are obtained according to the following equations: (1) ΔE *OOH = E *OOH − E * − (2E H2O − 3/2E H2) (2) ΔE *O = E *O − E * − (E H2O − E H2) (3) ΔE *OH = E *OH − E * − (E H2O − 1/2E H2) Where the E *, E *OOH, E *O, and E *OH are the total energies of the isolated catalyst and the catalyst adsorbed with *OOH, *O, and *OH, respectively. E H2O and E H2 are the total energies of the free H2O molecule and H2 molecule in the gas phase, respectively. The higher the ΔE species, the weaker binding between catalyst and adsorbed species. The adsorption free energy (ΔG species) is given by the equation of ΔG species = ΔE species + ΔZPE − TΔS, where T is the temperature of 298.15 K, ΔZPE is the change of zero point energy, and ΔS is the difference of the entropy. In addition, Zhang et al. proposed that the values of zero point energies and entropic corrections of the reaction intermediates on the various catalysts are similar [47]. Therefore, the ΔG species can be expressed as ΔG *OOH = ΔE *OOH + 0.40, ΔG *O = ΔE *O + 0.05, and ΔG *OH = ΔE *OH + 0.35 [48]. Furthermore, the change of Gibbs free energy of the ORR (ΔG ORR) is defined as follows: (4) ΔG 1 (* + O2 + H+ + e− → *OOH) = ΔG *OOH − 4.92 (5) ΔG 2 (*OOH + H+ + e− → *O + H2O) = ΔG *O − ΔG *OOH (6) ΔG 3 (*O + H+ + e− → *OH) = ΔG *OH − ΔG *O (7) ΔG 4 (*OH + H+ + e− → * + H2O) = −ΔG *OH As the OER is the inverse reaction of ORR, ΔG ORR = −ΔG OER [49]. The overpotential of ORR (η ORR) is determined by the reaction step with the smallest ΔG ORR, while the overpotential of OER (η OER) is determined by the reaction step with the largest ΔG OER [50,51]. (8) η ORR = (ΔG ORR min/e) + 1.23 (9) η OER = (ΔG OER max/e) − 1.23 The hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔG *H) is calculated as follows: (10) ΔG *H = ΔE *H + ΔE ZPE − TΔS Where ΔE ZPE is the difference in zero point energy, ΔS is the entropy between adsorbed state and gas phase, and T is the temperature of 298.15 K. ΔE *H is the adsorption energy of *H on the catalyst defined as: (11) ΔE *H = E *H − E * − 1/2E H2 Where E *H, E *, and E H2 are the total energies of catalyst adsorbed with a single *H atom, isolated catalyst, and H2 molecule, respectively. At the standard condition, the ΔE ZPE − TΔS is calculated to be 0.24 eV [52,53], therefore the Eq. (10) is simplified as follows: (12) ΔG *H = ΔE *H + 0.24 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Model and possible active sites In this work, the zigzag (15, 0) SWCNT is constructed, which contains a total of 300 carbon atoms and is terminated by hydrogen atoms on the edge. The optimized tube diameter of this SWCNT is 11.84 Å, which is consistent with the corresponding value (12 Å) of the synthesized sample by Gao et al. [40]. Fig. 1 shows the optimized C60-SWCNT composite structure, where the distance between the C60 and SWCNT is about 3.70 Å. And the E f of C60-SWCNT is calculated as −0.40 eV, meaning that the C60 and the SWCNT can form the stable composite structure, which is consistent with the experiment. As is well known, carbon atoms with the positive charges are more favorable to adsorb reaction species of the ORR and OER, which could be recognized as the active sites [54–56]. For the isolated SWCNT, the edge carbon atoms are usually demonstrated as the active sites. Therefore, for the C60-SWCNT composite structure, the highlighted edge carbon atom (named as site-1) is selected as one of the possible active sites. In addition, for the composite structure, the nearest carbon atoms between the C60 and SWCNT are likely to become the active centers due to the charge transfer between the two molecules. Therefore, the site-2 and site-3 are also determined as the probable catalytic sites as clearly depicted in Fig. 1. 3.2 Adsorption of ORR and OER species Since the adsorption properties of reaction species (*OOH, *O, and *OH) mainly determine the activity of catalysts for the ORR and OER, the ΔE species of *OOH, *O, and *OH on the pure SWCNT and C60-SWCNT are investigated. The optimized binding structures of *OOH, *O, and *OH on the C60-SWCNT are displayed in Fig. 2 , the calculated ΔE species of reaction species on the pure SWCNT and C60-SWCNT are listed in Table 1 . It should be noted that the values of ΔE species on the Pt(111) [37] and C60 [57] are transformed from our previous works. Since a large ΔE species value represents the weak binding of the reaction species, the binding strength of the *OOH is decreased as follows: Pt(111) > site-2 > SWCNT > site-1 > C60 > site-3. As is well known that the binding between Pt(111) and *OOH is slightly weak [58], a catalyst better than the Pt(111) should bind the *OOH stronger. Unfortunately, no active sites bind *OOH stronger than that on the Pt(111). The ΔE *OOH values on the pure C60 and SWCNT are 4.38 eV and 4.20 eV respectively, indicating the binding strength of the *OOH is 0.72 eV and 0.54 eV weaker than that on the Pt(111). This can presumably explain that the pure C60 and SWCNT are not effective catalysts for the ORR and OER. Encouragingly, the site-2 of C60-SWCNT shows the closest ΔE *OOH to the Pt(111), which is only 0.21 eV smaller than that of the latter. Therefore, the strategy of combining the pure C60 and SWCNT successfully improve the binding strength of the *OOH species. The ΔE *O on the pure C60 and SWCNT are 1.93 eV and 1.83 eV, respectively, the ΔE *O on the three sites of C60-SWCNT are increased to varying degrees. This suggests that the binding strength of the *O atom on the C60-SWCNT is weaker than that on the respective isolated C60 and SWCNT. Moreover, the binding strength of the *O on the three sites of C60-SWCNT is weaker than the theoretical value [37] as well as the experimental value on the Pt(111) [59], and it is clear that the site-2 possesses the closest ΔE *O to the Pt(111). The binding of the *OH species is similar to that of *O. The site-1 and site-3 of C60-SWCNT exhibit extremely weak binding strength of *OH compared with site-2 and the Pt(111), indicating that the ORR (OER) activity of site-1 and site-3 will be limited by the formation of *OH. Based on analysis for the binding of *OOH, *O, and *OH, it can be concluded that the site-2 should have high ORR and OER activity for C60-SWCNT. 3.3 The ORR, OER, and HER catalytic activity To investigate the catalytic activity of C60-SWCNT towards the ORR and OER, the changes of Gibbs free energy in each reaction step are calculated, then the overpotentials as well as the rate-determining steps (RDS) are obtained as shown in Fig. 3 . For the ORR, the RDS is determined as the step with the smallest Gibbs free energy change, while the RDS is determined as the step with the biggest Gibbs free energy change for the OER. It should be noted that pH value has a significant effect on the catalytic performance [60], but it is not considered in this work. For the ORR on pure SWCNT, too weak binding strength of *OH causes the *O → *OH proceed non-spontaneously, with a high η ORR of 1.40 V. For pure C60, although each ORR step can proceed spontaneously, an excessively high η ORR of 1.19 V indicates low ORR activity. For the C60-SWCNT, site-1, site-2, and site-3 can all catalyze the four-electron reaction pathway, the RDS is O2 → *OOH. This indicates that the hydrogenation of O2 is difficult to be proceeded. The site-1 and site-3 have very high overpotentials due to the extremely weak binding to *OOH for these two sites. The site-2 can effectively catalyze the whole ORR process with a low η ORR of 0.58 V, indicating that the ORR performance of site-2 has been greatly improved after combination. Such value is close to the experimentally value of 0.40∼0.43 V at 10 mA cm−2 in the phosphate buffer solution [40] and that on Pt(111) (0.45 V) [61]. Furthermore, the η ORR on site-2 is much smaller than that of IrO2 (1.03 V) [62]. For the OER process, the free energy diagram shows that *O → *OOH is the RDS on both pure SWCNT and C60 due to the exceedingly weak binding energy of *OOH, and the corresponding η OER values are determined to be 1.24 and 1.67 V, respectively. For the C60-SWCNT, the free energy diagram displays that the RDS of all three sites is the H2O → *OH. For the site-1 and site-3, the weak binding capacity of *OH results in a very high η OER of 1.70 V. It is worth noting that the η OER for the site-2 is dramatically reduced to 0.62 V. This is consistent with the experimentally value of 0.40∼0.71 V at 10 mA cm−2 in the H2SO4 solution. Compared with some state-of-the-art catalysts such as RuO2 and IrO2, the calculated OER catalytic performance of site-2 is worse than RuO2 (η OER = 0.37 V), but very close to IrO2 (η OER = 0.56 V) [63]. In addition, its η OER is much smaller than that of Pt(111) (1.13 V) [37]. For the HER, the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔG *H) is calculated, which can be a well-established descriptor to describe the catalytic activity in acidic media [52,64]. A catalyst that gives absolute value of ΔG *H ≈ 0 is considered as an optimal candidate for the HER based on the Sabatier principle [65]. Thus the strength of the adsorption of *H is neither too weak nor too strong. As clearly shown in Fig. 4 , the very large ΔG *H of site-1, site-3, and pure SWCNT implies their low activity toward the HER due to their weak adsorption of *H. On the contrary, for pure C60 and site-2, they have lower ΔG *H values. Moreover, the site-2 possesses a ΔG *H value (0.39 eV) close to optimal state of 0 eV, suggesting higher HER activity of the site-2. The HER catalytic performance of site-2 is worse than Pt(111) (ΔG *H = −0.09 eV) [53], but much better than IrO2 (ΔG *H = −0.75 eV) [66]. Based on the analysis of Gibbs free energy, the high activity of C60-SWCNT towards the ORR, OER, and HER may originate from the site-2 active site. 3.4 Origin of the activity The Mulliken charge distributions are investigated to explore the source of the activity of the multifunctional C60-SWCNT electrocatalyst as shown in Fig. 5 . The total Mulliken charges on the C60 of the C60-SWCNT are −0.01 e, suggesting the charge transfer from the SWCNT to the C60 after the combination, which is well consistent with the experimental results [40]. Furthermore, the carbon atom at the site-2 of the isolated C60 carries the positive charges of 0.002 e, which is greatly increased to 0.01 e in the C60-SWCNT composite structure. Since the carbon atom with the positive charges is more favorable to adsorb the reaction species, the activity should therefore be improved. The above results reveal that the combination of the C60 and SWCNT indeed induces intermolecular charge transfer, which enables site-2 to be the high active center of the C60-SWCNT. This is also confirmed by binding of the *OOH. The calculated negative charges of the *OOH on the pure C60 are −0.271 e, and are increased to −0.304 e at the site-2 of the C60-SWCNT. In other words, the electrostatic interaction between the active site and the *OOH is enhanced after combination of the C60 and SWCNT, resulting in the enhanced *OOH binding strength. This may be the source of the excellent activity for the C60-SWCNT. 4 Conclusions In summary, the DFT calculations are performed to reveal the mechanisms and the origin of activities for the fullerene and single-walled carbon nanotube composite as the metal-free multifunctional electrocatalyst for the ORR, OER, and HER. The possible active sites are explored, and the results suggesting that the carbon atom on the C60 nearest to the SWCNT is highly active (site-2) due to the enhanced binding strength of the *OOH species. The ORR on the site-2 can be completed through the four-electron reaction pathway, with the rate-determining step of O2 → *OOH. The overpotential of the ORR is calculated to be 0.58 V, which is close to the experimentally value of 0.40∼0.43 V at 10 mA cm−2 determined in the phosphate buffer solution. On the other hand, the mechanism of the OER on the site-2 is also a four-electron reaction pathway, with the rate-determining step of H2O → *OH. The overpotential is calculated to be 0.62 V, which is consistent with the experimentally value of 0.40∼0.71 V at 10 mA cm−2 in the H2SO4 solution, this is only 0.06 V larger than the calculated value of IrO2 catalyst (0.56 V). Furthermore, the hydrogen adsorption free energy is calculated to be a small value of 0.39 eV, also demonstrating the higher HER activity of the site-2. The source of the excellent activity of the C60-SWCNT composite structure should be attributed to the intermolecular charge transfer, which leads to the increased positive charges of the site-2 in the C60-SWCNT. Therefore, the catalytic activity of the site-2 is enhanced and the binding of the reaction species is further promoted.

        "dc:description": "The fullerene and single-walled carbon nanotube composite (C60-SWCNT) is experimentally investigated to have multifunctional catalytic activities for the oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution, however the mechanisms and the origin of activities are not clear at the molecular level. In this paper, by applying the density functional theory method, a highly active site of C60-SWCNT is identified (named as site-2). The oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution on the site-2 both can be completed through the four-electron reaction pathway and the corresponding overpotentials are 0.58 V and 0.62 V for them, respectively. Furthermore, the hydrogen adsorption free energy is calculated to be a small value of 0.39 eV, also indicating the high hydrogen evolution activity of the site-2. These calculation results are consistent with the experimental determinations. The source of the excellent activities of the C60-SWCNT composite should be attributed to the intermolecular charge transfer from the SWCNT to the C60, which leads to the increased positive charges of the site-2 in the C60-SWCNT. Therefore, the activity of the C60-SWCNT is enhanced and the binding of the reaction species is further improved.",
