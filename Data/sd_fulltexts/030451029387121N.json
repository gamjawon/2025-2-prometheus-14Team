Weatherhead and A. Williams* University Chemical Laboratory, Canterbury (UK); tel. (+44-227)764000 ext. 3693, fax. (+44-227)475475 K.A. Stacey University Biology Laboratory, Canterbury (UK) (Received April 12, 1993; accepted July 24,1993 ) Abstract Polyethyleneimine molecules alkylated with naphthylmethyl bromide and benzyl bromide and internally cross-linked by reaction with alkyl dihalides have binding capabilities enhanced by up to twofold. The modified and cross-linked polyethyleneimines bind large numbers of methyl orange dye molecules; since no evidence is found for dye stacking the cross-linked polyethyleneimine is considered to retain the flexibility of the native material. Increasing the cross-linking percentage from 0 to 20% of the available nitrogen causes a modest twofold increase in binding strength; cross-linking of polyethyleneimine in the presence of methyl orange dye produces a polymer which has doubled binding capacity for this dye than has the polymer cross-linked in the absence of added dye. Cross-linking does not reduce the number of primary amines in the alkylated polyethyleneOine available for reaction with Cu (I) ions or with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonate anion. The reactivity of the cross-linked polymers with 4-nitrophenyl esters is not reduced below that of the native polyethyleneimine. Key words: cross-linking; dye-binding capacity; polyethyleneOine; reactivity Introduction Polyethyleneimine and its derivatives have been demonstrated to react with esters [ 1 ] . Enhanced reactivity has been observed [ 2,3 ] with suitably modified polymer and esters possessing binding groups, such as long aliphatic side chains. The native polyethyleneimine molecule and those obtained by modification by monovalent reagents possess flexible natures which would not be capable of supporting attached reactive groups with precise spatial coordinates relative to each other. Cross-linking the alkylated polyethyleneimines -Corresponding author. 34 R.H. Weatherhead et al. /J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 33-O internally with divalent reactive groups should result in a more rigid structure which would therefore be capable of acting as a matrix for precisely located reactive groups for (for example) selective catalysis; the cross-linked polymers, however, could have a reduced reactivity complexing capability by restriction of entry of reagent molecules. Cross-linking of polyethyleneimine to provide a rigid matrix has been studied previously [4,5]. The present work is aimed to test whether there is any diminished reactivity (tested against aminolysis of esters, reaction with Cu (II) ions and with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonate ions) or reduced dye binding capacity due to accessibility problems in cross-linked polyethyleneimine derivatives compared with the non-cross-linked polymer. Experimental Materials Polyethyleneimine was obtained from BDH and was dialysed against distilled water for several days to remove any low molecular weight polymer. Viscometry gave a value of [ n ] =18.6 ml./g and a value of Mw = 240 000. Most other materials were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. and were either of analytic reagent grade or were recrystallised or redistilled from bench grade materials. Naphthylmethylpolyethyleneimine was prepared by diluting polyethyleneimine, (PEI) to a 60% solution with ethanol and slowly adding, with stirring, sufficient 1-bromomethylnaphthalene to react with 10% of the total nitrogen content. Samples were withdrawn occasionally to estimate the progress of the reaction by measurement of the free halide ion. After the reaction had completed solvent was removed in vacuo at a temperature less than 50\"C. The limiting viscosity of the sample (NPEI), at the same pH as that for the PEI, was found to be [ n ] =12.5 1 ml/g indicating a slight shrinkage of the size of the molecule compared with that of the benzylated material ( [ n ] =13.4 ml/g ) [6] and a much more compact molecule than the native polymer. Cross-linked polymer was prepared from deionised, alkylated polyethyleneimine. The requisite amount of NPEI as judged from the nitrogen content was diluted to yield a.0.4% solution. A portion of the solution of NPEI (50 ml) was stirred with enough dihalide (methylene bromide, 1,2-dibromoethane,1,3dichloroacetone, 1,4-dibromobutane,.1,5-dibromopentane and 1,6-dibromohexane) to react with 3% of the total nitrogen atoms (assumed to be present as amine). Samples were withdrawn at intervals to assay for released halide ion; control experiments in the absence of NPEI indicated that spontaneous hydrolysis was negligible compared with the reaction with polymer. The resulting solutions were dialysed to remove low molecular weight materials and then diluted with trishydroxymethylaminomethane (TRIS) buffer (0.5 M) at pH R.H. Weatherhead et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 33-44 35 7.00 to give a final concentration of 5 mMer in amine. The cross-linking was also carried out with sufficient dichloroacetone to consume 3.3, 6.6, 10, 13.3 and 20% of the available nitrogen of the NPEI. Benzylpolyethyleneimine (BPEI) was prepared as described above for the NPEI by allowing 10% of the nitrogen in PEI to react with benzyl bromide. BPEI was cross-linked as described above for the NPEI material. Molecular weights of the various polymer derivatives were computed from that of the native material taking into account the number and fragment molecular weights of alkyl and cross-linking groups added. Methods Analysis All concentrations of PEI and its modified material were determined from the nitrogen content (after ensuring that other nitrogenous material was absent by dialysis) by use of the Kjeldahl technique employing the Markhammodified digestion apparatus [ 7 ] . Halide ion was assayed by use of a silver electrode: the sample was diluted by 20% with acetone and adjusted to pH 2 with dilute nitric acid. A Radiometer potentiometric titration set comprising pH-meter PHM62 and TT60 titrator was employed with an automatic burette (ABUT l) containing 25 mM AgN03 in 25 mM nitric acid solution and a silver electrode. Limiting viscosities were determined with an Ubbelohde [8] suspended level viscometer by the method of Van der Berg [ 9 ] . The Mark-Houwink equation ( [n] =K M\") was employed to deduce the weight average molecular weights from the limiting viscosities. Equilibrium dialysis The apparatus, preparation of dialysis bags and treatment of data are as described by Hughes and Klotz [ 10 ] . A pair of test-tubes were charged with buffer solution (10 ml) and methyl orange at a known concentration. A dialysis bag with a standard polymer solution (10 ml) in the same buffer was immersed in one tube and a second bag containing the same volume of buffer was immersed in the other tube. The tubes were sealed and kept for several days in a thermostatted bath to reach equilibrium. The number of molecules of dye bound to a given weight of polymer was readily calculated from the optical densities of the external solutions (measured at 464 nm). The concentration of the polymer was 0.02% (based on Kjeldahl assay) and all buffers were of TRIS at 0.1 M at 25 C. Cross-linking in the presence and absence of dye A solution of NPEI (50 ml, 0.3%) was deionised, mixed with water (49.7 ml) and a solution of dichloroacetone in methanol (0.3 ml, 0.4 M) and stirred until the reaction was complete as judged from release of chloride ion. The 36 R.H. Weatherhead et al. / J. Mot. Catal. 85 (1993) 33-44 experiment was repeated, except that a solution of methyl orange (49.7 ml, 0.1 mM) replaced the water of the same volume. Both product solutions were treated with Zerolit FF1P to remove methyl orange and assayed for nitrogen. Cupric ion complexation The cross-linked polymer was diluted to 2.3 mMer in nitrogen and added (1 ml) to cupric acetate solution (2 ml, 10 mM) and kept for a few minutes. The absorbance at 635 nm was measured with a Unicam SP 500 spectrophotometer. Reaction of polymers with 4-nitrophenyl esters Polymer solution at the appropriate pH was incubated in a silica cell in the thermostatted cell compartment of a spectrophotometer (Unicam SP 500 or Beckman DBG ). The 4-nitrophenyl ester was added on the flattened tip of a glass rod as a stock solution (10 to 50 ,ul in acetonitrile). The absorbance at 400 nm was recorded as a function of time and pseudo-first order rate constants were computed from the changes by use of a suitable programme on a microcomputer. Assay of primary amine content by use of sodium 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonate A solution of the polymer (1 ml) in veronal buffer (0.1 M) at pH 8.5 was mixed with a fresh solution of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonate (TNBS) (30 mg/50 ml water, 1 ml). The resultant solution was kept at 40\"C for 10 in and then diluted with acetic acid (2 ml); the absorbance of this solution was then measured at 340 nm with a Unicam SP 500 spectrophotometer. The absorbance reading was corrected for a blank and the primary amine content computed using the extinction coefficient (12 000) for the product picramide [ 11,12 ] . Results Binding studies Binding studies with methyl orange were carried out on the various modified polyethyleneimines as described by Klotz. Fig. 1 (Table 1) presents the binding data as a function of free methyl orange (FMO) for NPEI cross-linked to the extent of 3% of the total nitrogen atoms. In none of the studies quoted was `dye-stacking' observed as evidenced by the absence of an absorption peak at 375 nm in the bound dye even when the value of R (moles of dye bound per mole of polymer rose to 570) . The value of the wavelength maximum altered with increasing values of R. Fig. 2 (Table 2) illustrates the change in binding as a function of the percentage of cross-linking in NPEI by 1,3-dichloroacetone.

Catal. 85 (1993) 33-O the total reaction. The data for the reaction of polyethyleneimine derivatives are recorded in Tables 6 and 7; the extent of the reaction is only a very small percentage of the total available nitrogen because the ester concentrations never exceeded 0.1 mM whereas polymer concentration (in nitrogen merlarity) varied from 20 to 93 mMer. Discussion Effect on dye-binding of cross-linking at 3% total nitrogen Klotz et al. [ 13 ] have shown that the addition of an hydrophobic side chain to polyethyleneimine leads to increased binding abilities for dyes in the modified polymer. Naphthylated polyethyleneimine prepared here possesses a lower limiting viscosity than the parent polymer indicating a smaller particle size possibly due to mutual attraction of the non-polar groups in the aqueous medium. The binding ability of the NPEI toward methyl orange (on a weight basis: 50 moles/100 000 g polymer at [FMO ] =10 ,CM) is between that of the hexanoylated (10 moles) and laurylated (100 moles) derivatives at the same [ FMO ] [ 13 ] . A relatively compact polymer such as serum albumin binds relatively small quantities of dye [ 14 ] compared with the flexible, non-crosslinked polyethyleneimine [ 13 ] . At low [FMO ] concentrations there is no significant difference in the binding abilities between the polymer cross-linked to 3% of the original NPEI. At high [FMO ] cross-linking agents three and four atoms in length appear to reduce the binding of the dye marginally whereas agents spanning two, five and six atoms increase the binding relative to the non-cross-linked polymer. Methylene dibromide has no effect on the binding ability for the dye and since the bromide ion is not completely expelled in the cross-linking process it is probable that the polymer is not effectively cross-linked. It is reasonable that the ateric hindrance introduced in the first alkylation by methylene bromide is sufficient to inhibit the second step. Such a problem of steric hindrance would not arise with the longer cross-linking agents. The binding capabilities of the cross-linked polymers suggest that these species are as flexible as the native form. The cross-linked polymers are still able to bind large numbers of methyl orange molecules: R values in excess of some 340 dye molecules bound to each molecule of polymer indicating an extremely flexible macromolecule. No dye `stacking' is observed up to R values of 570 as evidenced by the absence of an absorption maximum at 375 nm; Takagishi and Klotz [4] observed dye `stacking' at an R value of 2.7 in their PEI derivative of molecular weight 1800. The wavelength of the absorption maximum changes with increasing values of R in our experiments consistent with the dye binding in an hydrophobic region. The binding ability of the NPEI-polymer rises by about twofold as the R.H. Weatherhead et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 33-44 43 percentage of cross-linking of the polymer increases; above 10% cross-linking there is no further increase in binding capability. It is difficult to say whether there is sufficient material in the polyethyleneimine polymer (molecular weight 1800) employed by Takagishi and Klotz [4] to provide architecture for more than a few active sites for binding a dye with a molecular weight of 327. Calculations from the paper [4 ] indicate that at log FMO = - 5 approximately two dye molecules are bound. The present polymer (m.w.t. 240 000) has a better chance of forming clefts by cross-linking in the presence of bound dye. The polymer, cross-linked by 1,3-dichloroacetone in the presence of dye, binds significantly better than the control polymer which is cross-linked in the absence of dye; it binds about 576 dye molecules at log FMO = - 4.5 whereas the control polymer binds 467 molecules at log FMO = - 4.5. Similar results were obtained by Klotz and Takagishi [ 4 ] for the much smaller polyethyleneimine derivative [ 4 ] . In view of the binding results for the smaller polymer it is possible that the function of the dye in the crosslinking experiments is to protect binding regions against destruction by the reagent. Fission of 4-nitrophenyl esters by cross-linked polyethyleneimines Benzyl- and naphthylmethyl-polyethyleneimines react with 4-nitrophenyl adipate some ten- and fivefold faster than does the unmodified PEI (Table 6). Cross-linking of BPEI to the extent of 3.3% with 1,3-dichloroacetone does not change the rate constant significantly. Increasing the hydrophobic nature of the side chain of the ester (Table 4) decreases the reactivity with the benzylated polymer. The results of the copper complexation experiments show that the crosslinking does not affect the availability of nitrogen able to chelate with the Cu (II) ion. This result and that for the availability of primary amines (Table 5) suggest that a substantial proportion of the primary amines remain available for reaction at cross-linking levels up to 25% of the total nitrogen. This is borne out by the absence of a substantial drop in reactivity with the 4-nitrophenyl esters (Table 6). The question of binding of methyl orange to polyethyleneimine derivatives remains an intriguing phenomenon as it is still not certain how such a small molecule as that employed by Klotz and Takagishi can complex with such large numbers of dye without dye stacking. The present cross-linked molecules are large and could support cavities. The cross-linked polymers remain very flexible after cross-linking as evidenced by the nitrogen availability to complexing, reaction with trinitrobenzenesulphonate and reaction with esters; the undiminished binding capacity and reactivity towards esters for the crosslinked polymers make them useful candidates as supports for catalytic entities in solution. 44 R.H.

Stacey University Biology Laboratory, Canterbury UK Polyethyleneimine molecules alkylated with naphthylmethyl bromide and benzyl bromide and internally cross-linked by reaction with alkyl dihalides have binding capabilities enhanced by up to twofold. The modified and cross-linked polyethyleneimines bind large numbers of methyl orange dye molecules; since no evidence is found for dye stacking the cross-linked polyethyleneimine is considered to retain the flexibility of the native material. Increasing the cross-linking percentage from 0 to 20% of the available nitrogen causes a modest twofold increase in binding strength; cross-linking of polyethyleneimine in the presence of methyl orange dye produces a polymer which has doubled binding capacity for this dye than has the polymer cross-linked in the absence of added dye. Cross-linking does not reduce the number of primary amines in the alkylated polyethyleneimine available for reaction with Cu(I) ions or with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonate anion. The reactivity of the cross-linked polymers with 4-nitrophenyl esters is not reduced below that of the native polyethyleneimine.
