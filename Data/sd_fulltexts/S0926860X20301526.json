Graphical abstract Mo/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used in many important commercial chemical processes. In this study we show that CeO2 modification of Al2O3 greatly enhances the activity and stability of Mo/Al2O3 catalyst in high temperature methanation reaction. Mo catalysts supported on Al2O3, CeO2/Al2O3 mixed oxides and CeO2 were prepared to investigate the promotion mechanism of Ce in Mo/Ce/Al catalysts. It was demonstrated that MoS2 phase supported on Al2O3 had a poor dispersion and was easy to be sintered in reaction. The interaction between Mo and CeO2 was stronger than that between Mo and Al2O3. Mo phase supported on CeO2 tended to exist as mono-layer MoS2. However, the highly dispersed MoS2 slabs were unstable and increased in length in reaction with the sintering of CeO2. When CeO2 was loaded on Al2O3, a high temperature stable Ce phase was obtained. Thus, MoS2 phase supported on CeO2/Al2O3 exhibited high dispersion and excellent high temperature stability. Keywords Mo/Al2O3 catalyst Cerium Interaction Dispersion Methanation Sintering 1 Introduction Alumina supported Mo catalysts have always attracted much attention due to their extensive applications in chemical industry. They are active for many reactions, e.g. olefin metathesis, [1,2] hydro-desulfurization [3,4], thermo-catalytic cracking (TCC) [5,6], water-gas-shift (WGS) [7,8]and methanation [9–11]. In all reactions the interaction between Mo and alumina plays an important role to determine the catalytic properties of the catalysts. It is believed that the interaction can influence the morphology, dispersion and the stability of active Mo phase. [12,13] However, pure alumina does not show strong enough interaction with Mo in some reactions [14], especially those operated at high temperature like WGS, methanation and TCC. Thus, some support modifiers like La [15],Mg [7,16],and/or Ti [17] have to be introduced into the Mo-Al catalytic system for industrial application. Ceria is a widely used catalytic promoter to modify structural or electronic properties of catalysts. It has been used in many important reactions such as CH4 reforming, [18] TCC [6], and CO oxidation [19,20], NOx reduction [21,22],etc. The main reason for ceria being a promising catalyst promoter relies on its unique role in creating Ce3+/Ce4+ redox couple and forming labile oxygen vacancies. However, a major disadvantage associated with ceria is its low specific surface area and poor thermal stability at high temperatures. In order to overcome these limitations, ceria is usually deposited on high-surface area oxides such as alumina. Many studies concerning the structure of Ce-Al mixed oxides and catalytic properties of Ce-Al supported catalysts have been reported.23-242526 It was demonstrated that ceria interacted strongly with alumina in Ce-Al system. The interaction helps to improve the thermal stability of alumina support. [23,24] Furthermore, the Ce-Al mixed oxides supported catalysts showed higher metal dispersion and thermal resistant ability than those supported on pure alumina. [25,26] However, there is limited research on Mo catalysts supported on Ce modified Al2O3 supports. In our recent studies, [10,26] Mo catalysts supported on Ce-Al mixed oxides were successfully applied for sulfur resistant methanation reaction. Jiang et al.[26] synthesized Ce-Al mixed oxide supports with impregnation, deposition precipitation (DP) and solution combustion methods. It was found that Mo catalyst loaded on the support prepared with DP method had the best catalytic activity. CeO2 layers were formed on the surface of the support when Ce was loaded on Al2O3 by DP method. These CeO2 layers could inhibit the formation of Al2(MoO4)3 and crystalline MoO3 phase in the catalyst, and help to improve the catalytic activity. However, CeO2 layers in the catalysts were not stable in high temperature reactions which led to the continual decrease of the methantion activity. In this study Al2O3 supports with and without Ce modification were prepared with mixing kneading method. Surprisingly, Mo catalysts loading on the Ce modified Al2O3 support demonstrate high activity and stability (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 ) in high temperature methanation reaction. To understand the promotion effect of Ce in the Mo/Ce/Al catalyst several model catalysts supported on Al2O3, CeO2 and CeO2/Al2O3 mixed oxides were designed. The catalysts were characterized by H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), Thermogravimetry (TG), X–ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), Laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X–ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The methanation performance of the catalysts was evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor at 550 °C. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation XCeO2/100Al2O3 (X = 0, 10 or 30, weight ratio) supports were synthesized by kneading and extrusion molding method using dilute nitric acid as the peptizing reagent. Boehmite (Sasol, Germany) and Ce(NO3)3 were used as the precursors of alumina and cerium, respectively. Ce(NO3)3 solution was added during the preparation of kneading paste of Al2O3 support. The resulting extrudates were dried at 120 °C for 12 h and calcinated at 600 °C for 4 h. CeO2 support was obtained by calcination of Ce(NO3)3· 6H2O at 450 °C for 4 h. All catalysts were prepared by the impregnation of the supports with the (NH4)6Mo7O24 solution followed by drying at 120 °C and calcination at 600 °C. The weight ratio of MoO3 to XCeO2-100Al2O3 oxide was 20%. Due to the small pore volume of CeO2 support (0.15 cm3/g) the weight ratio of MoO3 to CeO2 ratio was reduced to 10% in MoO3/CeO2 catalyst. The resulting catalysts MoO3/Al2O3, MoO3/10CeO2/Al2O3, MoO3/30CeO2/Al2O3 and MoO3/CeO2 were denoted as Mo/Al, Mo/10Ce/Al, Mo/30Ce/Al and Mo/Ce, respectively. The weight compositions of catalysts measured by XRF are illustrated in Table1 . 2.2 Catalyst characterization BET surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter measurements were determined by nitrogen isothermal physisorption at −196 °C using a Micromeritics ASAP 3020. Before the adsorption measurements, samples were degassed under vacuum at 90 °C for 1 h and 350 °C for 10 h. XRD patterns of fresh catalysts were obtained with a D/max–RA X–ray diffratometer (Rigaku, Japan), equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 40 kV and 150 mA. XRD patterns of catalysts after activation and reaction were recoded with a D/max–2600/PC X–ray diffratometer (Rigaku, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation. XRF analyses on fresh catalysts were carried out on Rigaku ZSX Primus IIX-Ray spectrometer which is equipped with an Rh target X-ray tube at 3 kW. H2-TPR studies were performed on Auto Chem. II 2920 equipment (Micromeritics, USA). 40 mg catalyst was placed in a U–type quartz tube reactor and ramped from room temperature up to 1000 °C in 10% H2/90% Ar. The heating rate was maintained at 10 °C/min and flow rate at 50 ml/min. TG analyses on uncalcined samples were carried out on Netzsch STA449F3. The rate of heating was kept at 5 °C/min and the measurements were carried out in N2 flowing at 50 ml/min. LRS were obtained using an InVia-Reflex (Renishaw, England) laser Raman spectrometer; this system is integrated with highly sensitive, research-grade microscopes. The 532-nm emission line from the Ar+-ion laser (Spectra Physics) was employed as the incident light beam. XPS were recorded using a Thermo Escalab 250Xi system at base pressure of 1 × 10−9 mbar. Samples were excited with monochromatized Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV). The analyzer was operating in a constant pass energy mode (20 eV). The C 1s peak of adventitious carbon (284.8 eV) was used as a reference for estimating the binding energy.. TEM analyses of samples after sulphurization and reaction were performed on Tecnai G2 F20 (200 kV) transmission electron microscope (TEM) (FEI, Holland), with a high resolution of 0.15 nm/200 kV. Sample specimens for TEM studies were prepared by ultrasonic dispersion of the catalysts in ethanol, and the suspensions were dropped onto a micro-mesh copper grid. 2.3 Reactor system and operation procedure The methanation performance of the catalysts was evaluated in a fixed bed reactor. For each experiment, approximately 3.0 g catalyst (20–40 mesh) was filled in the reactor. All the catalysts were sulphurized in situ with a 3 vol% H2S/H2 gas mixture at 400 °C for 4 h. Following the pretreatment, the reactor was set to reaction condition: syngas (H2/CO = 1.0) containing 1.2% H2S, 550 °C, 3.0 MPa and GHSV = 5000 h-1. At the completion of experiment, passivation was done by introducing a flow of 1% O2/99% N2 at room temperature, and then the catalysts were collected and put into a sealed glass bottle for characterization. A detailed description of reactor, analysis systems and calculating method of product selectivity were provided elsewhere. [10] 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Methanation performance Changes of CO conversion with the time-on-stream (TOS) on the catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. For Mo/Al catalyst, the CO conversion is 57% at the beginning of the reaction and continually decreases to 49% after 16 h of test. CeO2 modified catalysts Mo/10Ce/Al and Mo/30Ce/Al demonstrate stable methanation activity during the whole reaction period and the CO conversions remain around 61% and 68%, respectively. For Mo/Ce catalyst, the CO conversion starts at 64% and gradually decreases to 60% in 23 h test. Table 1 shows the apparent activities (based on CO conversion rate per unit Mo) of catalysts at 5 h and 15 h. It is evident that Mo/Al shows the lowest activity and poorest stability in all catalysts. After CeO2 modification the activity and stability of the Mo/Al catalyst are significantly enhanced. With increasing CeO2 content from 10% to 30%, the activity of the catalyst increases further. Mo catalyst supported on CeO2 displays the highest activity. The stability of Mo/Ce catalyst is poorer than those supported on Ce/Al mixed oxides, but better than that supported on Al2O3. A 100 h life test was conducted over the Mo/30Ce/Al catalyst. As shown in Fig. 2, the CO conversion and CH4 selectivity are respectively stable around 70% and 50% for the duration of the test. The activity and stability of the catalyst are much higher than the Mo/Ce/Al catalysts reported in our previous study. [10,26] Combined with the results of Jiang et al. 26] we can conclude that CeO2 addition method has a significant effect on performance of Mo/Ce/Al catalyst. CeO2 added with mixing kneading method better improves the activity and stability of the catalyst. CH4, CO2 and C2H6 are the main products detected in the tail gas during the reactions. No evident differences on products selectivity are observed over all catalysts (see supplementary Fig. S1). As shown in Table 1, CH4 selectivity of all catalysts is about 50% and does not change with the increase of reaction time. The results indicate that neither Ce promoter nor catalyst support has a significant effect on CH4 selectivity. In addition, the change in activity had no evident effect on CH4 selectivity. 3.2 Characterization of fresh catalysts 3.2.1 N2 adsorption-desorption The BET surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter of fresh catalysts are illustrated in Table 2 . It can be seen that CeO2 addition leads to a significantly decrease in the surface area of Mo/Al catalyst. With increasing CeO2 content, the surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter of the catalyst continue to decrease. The surface area variation of the catalysts with increasing of CeO2 content is similar to the observation in Au/CeO2/Al2O3 system, [27] implying that the pores of Al2O3 support were plugged after CeO2 loading. The surface area of Mo catalyst supported on pure CeO2 is 16 m2/g. It is much smaller than these supported on Al2O3 and Ce/Al mixed oxides. 3.2.2 H2-TPR and TG H2-TPR profiles of the samples are shown in Fig. 3 . In the profiles of Mo catalysts supported on Al2O3 and Ce/Al mixed oxides, two well-separated H2 consumption peaks can be observed. With the increasing of CeO2 content, the maximum temperatures of the two peaks both shift to high values. It suggests that CeO2 addition enhances the interaction between Mo and support, and the interaction increases with increasing of CeO2 content. For Mo/Al catalyst the two peaks are a characteristic of the two-step reduction from MoO3 to MoO2 and MoO2 to Mo [28]. For Mo/10Ce/Al and Mo/30Ce/Al, based on our previous study [29], the first peak can be related to MoO3 to MoO2 and surface CeO2 to non-stoichiometric Ce oxide species; the second peak corresponds to MoO2 to Mo and the reduction of certain Ce species that interacted with Al2O3. The profile of the pure CeO2 exhibits three reduction peaks. According to the literature, [30,31] the first two peaks at temperatures lower than 550 °C are due to the reduction of surface oxygen of CeO2 and the last peak at about 715 °C is associated to the bulk Ce oxide reduction. Mo/Ce catalyst presents three reduction peaks in the profile. The first peak at about 580 °C can be attributed to the reduction of surface oxygen of CeO2 and MoO3 to MoO2. [30]. The second peak at around 750 °C may be related to the reduction of bulk CeO2 referring to the H2-TPR profile of pure CeO2. The third peak at temperature above 900 °C possibly corresponds to MoO2 to metal Mo reduction. Evidently the reduction of Mo catalyst supported on CeO2 starts and finishes at higher temperatures than those supported on Al2O3 or Ce/Al mixed oxides. The result indicates that the interaction between Mo and CeO2 is much stronger than that between Mo and Al2O3 as well as Mo and Ce/Al mixed oxides. Fig. 4 shows the TG and DTG profiles of uncalcinated Mo/Al and Mo/30Ce/Al catalysts. Two main weight loss processes are shown in the TG profile of Mo/Al. The first step is between room temperature and 400 °C and corresponds to the weight loss of removal of water and the decomposition of (NH4)6Mo7O24. The second one between 800-1000 °C is the characteristic weight loss of the sublimation molybdena [32] In TG profile of Mo/30Ce/Al only the first weight loss step at low temperature present. It is evident that CeO2 addition enhanced the interaction between Mo and the support and thus hindered the sublimation of the supported molybdena. 3.2.3 XRD and LRS study of fresh catalysts XRD patterns of fresh catalysts are shown in Fig. 5 . Mo/Al catalyst displays diffraction peaks of ɣ-Al2O3 and MoO3 in the pattern. After 10% and 30% CeO2 addition, the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 [33] becomes the dominant phase in the patterns. With increasing CeO2 content, the peak intensity of CeO2 increases while that of MoO3 decreases gradually. At Ce/Al ratio of 30/100, the peaks of MoO3 vanish completely. The diminished MoO3 peaks in the patterns suggest that CeO2 addition improves the dispersion of Mo phase and the dispersion degree increases with increasing CeO2 content. For Mo/Ce catalyst, only the characteristic peaks of CeO2 appear in the pattern and no peak related to Mo species can be observed, indicating that Mo oxide species are highly dispersed on CeO2 support. Fig. 6 shows the Raman spectra of the fresh catalysts. Mo/Al catalyst clearly shows several bands at 281, 320, 355, 378, 818, 847, 874, 963, 1003 and 1024 cm-1. Referring to the literature, [14,34] the bands at 355 and 963 cm-1 are related to the amorphous octahedrally coordinated Mo6+(O) species, the bands at 320, 847 and 874 cm-1 correspond to tetrahedrally coordinated Mo6+(T) species, the bands at 1003 and 1024 cm-1 can be assigned to Al2(MoO4)3 species, and the bands at 281, 378, 818 cm-1 are due to the crystalline MoO3. After 10% and 30% CeO2 addition, all above bands disappeared except that at 963 cm-1. Meanwhile, a new band appears at 460 cm-1 which corresponds to the vibration mode of T2g for CeO2 [35]. With 10% CeO2 addition the 963 cm-1 band shifts to 953 cm-1 and further to 949 cm-1 with 30% CeO2 addition. The blue shift of the band indicates a gradual cluster size decrease of the polymolybdate species in the catalyst. [36] This result suggests that CeO2 addition improves the dispersion of Mo oxides supported on γ-Al2O3, which is in conformity with the XRD analysis. In the spectrum of Mo/Ce, CeO2 band at 460 cm-1 as well as a low and broad band around 936 cm-1 are observed. Based on the literature, the later band can be attributed to the highly dispersed CexMoyOz species. [35,37] From the LRS study it can be seen that CeO2 addition into Mo/Al catalyst not only decreases the crystalline MoO3 but also inhibits the Al2(MoO4)3 phase formation. Crystalline MoO3 and Al2(MoO4)3 species have been widely studied in Mo-Al system. In our previous study, [14,26] it has been demonstrated that these two species are detrimental to the methanation performance of Mo/Al2O3 catalyst. The formation of these two phases depended on not only the MoO3 loading but also the calcination temperature of Mo/Al2O3 catalyst. When the MoO3 loading exceeded the saturated monolayer coverage (SMC) of Al2O3, the excess poorly dispersed Mo either presented as crystalline MoO3 (instead of amorphous Mo species) or interacted with Al2O3 to form Al2(MoO4)3 phase. In this study the loading of MoO3 in Mo/Al catalyst is evidently higher than the SMC of the γ-Al2O3 support, and consequently crystalline MoO3 and Al2(MoO4)3 phase both present in the Raman spectrum. CeO2 addition evidently improves the dispersion of Mo phase and inhibits the interaction between Mo and Al2O3. Thus, the formation of MoO3 and Al2(MoO4)3 phases are prohibited after CeO2 promotion. 3.3 Analyses of catalysts before and after reaction The BET surface area and pore volume of catalysts before and after reaction are illustrated in Table 3 . It can be seen that the BET surface area of all catalysts decreases, while the pore volume increases. However, the CO conversion of Mo/30Ce/Al catalyst remained stable during the whole reaction, which confirmed that the change in catalyst pore structure within a certain range may had no significant effect on the stability of the catalyst. To clarify the electronic state of cerium on the surface of catalysts, Ce 3d XPS spectra of Mo/30Ce/Al and Mo/Ce catalyst after reaction are shown in Fig. 7 . For purpose of comparison, the spectrum of pure CeO2 support is also included in the figure. Six peaks corresponding to three pairs of spin-orbit doublets can be identified in the spectrum of CeO2. Based on the data reported in literature, [23,38], binding energies at 883.2, 889.6 and 899.2 eV correspond to v, vⅡ and vIII components, respectively. Binding energies at 901.7, 908.1 and 917.6 eV are related to u, uⅡ and uIII components, respectively. The broad vⅡ peak characterizes cerium in oxide state of Ⅳ (CeO2). The XPS spectrum of Ce 3d for Mo/30Ce/Al is substantially different from that of CeO2. It can be seen that two new components vⅠat 886.3 eV and uⅠ at 904.9 are the main phase in the spectrum. The strongest peaks v and u in CeO2 spectrum become two shoulders in the Mo/30Ce/Al spectrum and the peaks vⅡ, vIII, uⅡ and uIII all disappear. According to the literature, the peaks vⅠ and uⅠcorrespond to the 3d104f1 ground electronic states of Ce3+ [23]. All the results indicate that Ce3+ is the major surface species in Mo/30Ce/Al catalyst after reaction and a small number of Ce4+ species also exist. The Ce 3d XPS spectrum of Mo/Ce catalyst is similar to that of pure CeO2, except that two shoulder peaks vⅠ and uⅠare present. It suggests that Ce4+ is the major surface phase in Mo/Ce catalyst after reaction. The Ce 3d XPS results demonstrate that most of the surface Ce species in Mo/30Ce/Al present as Ce3+ after reaction, while in Mo/Ce most of Ce species exist as Ce4+ and only parts of Ce4+ are reduced to Ce3+. Combining the results of XRD and XPS, it can be concluded that there are two different Ce species in the Mo/30Ce/Al. In the bulk of the catalyst Ce presents as Ce4+, but on the surface Ce3+ are the main species and a small number of Ce4+ species also exist. The bulk phase situation of Mo/Ce is the same as Mo/30Ce/Al, but on the surface Ce4+ are still the main phase rather than Ce3+. [39] Mo 3d XPS spectra of catalysts after reaction are given in supplementary Fig. S3. All spectra show strong Mo 3d doublet at 229.4 and 232.5 eV corresponding to MoS2. Typical S 2 s peak (226.4 eV) and weak Mo6+ peak (236.0 eV) also appeared in all spectra [37]. The results of Mo 3d XPS indicate that MoS2 is main phase of all catalyst after reaction. To study phase and crystal size changes of Mo and Ce species during reaction, some of the samples before and after reaction are characterized by XRD and TEM. Fig. 8 displays the XRD results of the catalysts before and after reaction. In all the patterns, no Mo phase is present, indicating that Mo species in all catalysts are highly dispersed. For Mo/Al and Mo/30Ce/Al, no significant differences can be seen between the XRD patterns before and after reaction. But for Mo/Ce, the peak intensities of CeO2 increases significantly after reaction. The average particle size of CeO2 in Mo/30Ce/Al and Mo/Ce as determined by Scherrer equation (via 2θ value at 28.6°) are shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen that the particle size of CeO2 in Mo/30Ce/Al has no evident change during reaction, but in Mo/Ce it increases from 32 to 36 nm. According to the study of Damyanova et al. [23], there was a strong interaction between cerium and alumina in the mixed oxide of Ce/Al, which could prevent sintering of cerium particles. Herein, it is clear that the interaction between cerium and alumina in Mo/Ce/Al inhibits the CeO2 sintering during the high temperature methanation reaction. The sintering resistance ability of cerium in Mo/Ce/Al is also affected by the loading method of CeO2 on Al2O3. H2-TPR result in supplementary Figure S2 indicates that CeO2 loaded by the mixing kneading method has stronger interaction with Al2O3 than that loaded by impregnation or DP method. Under the same test conditions, the stability of Mo/Ce/Al catalyst in this study is significantly better than that of Jiang et al [26]. This is obviously due to the different preparation method of Ce/Al support. Possibly due to the weak interaction between CeO2 and Al2O3, CeO2 phase in Mo/Ce/Al catalysts sintered in the study of Jiang et al. and it leaded to the continual deactivation of the catalysts in methanation reaction. Fig. 9 shows the typical TEM images of catalysts before and after reaction. The statistical calculation results for the average length ( L ¯ ) and stacking number ( N ¯ ) of MoS2 slabs from the images are listed in Table 4 . For Mo/Al, the visible MoS2 particles are mostly multilayer nanosheets. The average length and stacking number increased significantly during the reaction. In contract, Mo/30Ce/Al and Mo/Ce show many monolayer and bilayer MoS2 nanosheets, and the layer number has no evident change during the reaction. For Mo/Ce, the average length of MoS2 slabs as well as CeO2 particle size increased evidently during the reaction. As shown in Fig. 9e and 9f, MoS2 phase supported on CeO2 tends to exist as monolayer nanosheets covering the CeO2 particles. Thus, the MoS2 slabs increase in length over pure CeO2 can be related to the particle size growth of CeO2 support. In TEM images of Mo/Ce/Al catalyst, a large number of crystal lattices of cerium oxide can be seen and the lattices uniformly disperse on Al2O3 surface. It suggests that cerium is highly dispersed on Al2O3 in this study. From the TEM analyses, it can be found that the dispersion of Mo phase supported on CeO2 is much higher than that supported on Al2O3. When Al2O3 is modified by CeO2, the dispersion of Mo species on the support is improved significantly. The results are consistent with the XRD and LRS studies of the fresh catalysts. During the methanation reaction the sintering of MoS2 phase happened for catalysts supported on Al2O3 and CeO2, but for catalysts supported over Ce/Al mixed oxides the MoS2 phase remained stable. The sintering of MoS2 in Mo/Al can be attributed to the weak interaction between Mo and alumina according to the H2-TPR and TG studies. While in Mo/Ce catalyst it can be attributed to the crystal size growth of CeO2 support. Combining the XRD, LRS and TEM results, the low activity of Mo/Al catalyst can be attributed the poor dispersion of Mo phase and the Al2(MoO4)3 phase formation. CeO2 addition improves the dispersion of Mo phase and inhibits the Al2(MoO4)3 phase formation, and thus greatly enhances the activity of Mo/Al catalyst. Furthermore, CeO2 addition can prevent the sintering of MoS2 species during the reaction. Therefore, the stability of Mo/Al catalyst is also improved after CeO2 addition. Although the surface area and Mo loading of Mo/Ce are much lower than Mo/Al, the methanation activity of Mo/Ce is much higher than Mo/Al. This can be attributed to the higher Mo phase dispersion of Mo/Ce catalyst. H2-TPR results indicate that Mo interacts strongly with CeO2. Possibly due to the strong interaction between Mo and CeO2, most of MoS2 species are exist as highly dispersed mono-layer MoS2 nanosheets. According to the TEM photos in Fig. 9 the dimension of the MoS2 nanosheets over CeO2 support increases during the high temperature methanation reaction and thus the activity of Mo/Ce catalyst decreases continually. It is clear that the Mo species are highly dispersed on the CeO2 support, but they are easily sintered at high temperatures. Therefore, the Mo/Ce catalyst should have a very good application prospect in a low temperature reaction system. 4 Conclusions In this work Mo catalysts supported on Al2O3, 10%CeO2/Al2O3, 30%CeO2/Al2O3 and CeO2 are synthesized. For Mo/Al2O3 catalyst, the dispersion of Mo phase is poor and the methanation activity is low. The activity of Mo/Al2O3 decreases continually with reaction time due to the MoS2 phase sintering. CeO2 addition into Mo/Al2O3 with mixing kneading method enhances the interaction between Mo and support and improves the dispersion of Mo phase. When CeO2 content increases from 10% to 30%, the interaction strength and dispersion degree increase. Furthermore, the addition of CeO2 also inhibits the sintering of MoS2 phase in the methanation reaction. Thus, CeO2 modification greatly enhances the activity and stability of Mo/Al2O3 catalyst. For CeO2 supported Mo catalyst, the interaction between Mo and CeO2 is strong and Mo phase is highly dispersed over CeO2. During the methanation reaction, Mo/Ce shows higher activity and better stability than Mo/Al2O3. But due to the MoS2 sintering which can be attributed to the crystal size growth of CeO2 support, the activity of Mo/Ce slowly decreases over time.

        "dc:description": "Mo/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used in many important commercial chemical processes. In this study we show that CeO2 modification of Al2O3 greatly enhances the activity and stability of Mo/Al2O3 catalyst in high temperature methanation reaction. Mo catalysts supported on Al2O3, CeO2/Al2O3 mixed oxides and CeO2 were prepared to investigate the promotion mechanism of Ce in Mo/Ce/Al catalysts. It was demonstrated that MoS2 phase supported on Al2O3 had a poor dispersion and was easy to be sintered in reaction. The interaction between Mo and CeO2 was stronger than that between Mo and Al2O3. Mo phase supported on CeO2 tended to exist as mono-layer MoS2. However, the highly dispersed MoS2 slabs were unstable and increased in length in reaction with the sintering of CeO2. When CeO2 was loaded on Al2O3, a high temperature stable Ce phase was obtained. Thus, MoS2 phase supported on CeO2/Al2O3 exhibited high dispersion and excellent high temperature stability.",
