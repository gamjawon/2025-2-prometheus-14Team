[1, 2], is a derivative of high-silica ZSM-5, in which titanium is thought to be incorporated at the tetrahedral site of the framework. This new zeolite has been found to be effective in the oxidation of a variety of organic compounds with aqueous hydrogen peroxide as oxidant under mild conditions: hydroxylation of aromatic compounds [3-6], epoxidation of alkenes [7] and oxygenation of alkanes [8, 9]. Oxidation of alcohols has also been claimed in a patent [ 10 ]. The incorporation of catalytic sites within zeolite channels and cages of molecular dimensions provides the basis of molecular shape-selective catalysts. We have already reported the remarkable shape selectivity observed in the epoxidation of alkenes [11-13] and oxygenation of alkanes [8]. Here we describe the oxidation of unsaturated alcohols with titanium silicalite-1 catalyst and our finding that the selectivity in oxidation is greatly dependent on the structure of the unsaturated alcohol. Titanium silicalite-1 (Si/Ti=52) was prepared from Ti(OC2H5)4, Si(OC2H5)4 and (C3H7)4NOH as described in a patent [ 1 ]. A typical oxidation run used 0.1 g of catalyst in 2.5 ml of substrate in a round-bottom flask, to which was added 2.5 ml of a 30% aqueous solution of Hz02, unless otherwise noted. The resulting mixture was stirred at 50 C for 3 h. Adsorption experiments were carried out at 30 C using 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene (which is too large to enter the pores of titanium silicalite-1) as solvent [14]. The effects of the structure of C4-C6 unsaturated alcohols on the reactivity toward oxidation was investigated; pertinent data are shown in Table 1. With unsaturated alcohols having an internal -CH=CH- double bond, epoxidation of the double bond and oxidation of the alcoholic group to the aldehyde or ketone group occurred competitively (entries 4, 8 and 9). Epoxidation of a terminal CHZ=CH- double bond in unsaturated alcohols was slow compared with that of the internal double bond. However, it is noteworthy that the 0304-5102/93/$06.00 9 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

Similar selectivities were observed in intermolecular competition. Table 2 lists the results of competitive oxidation of 2-pentanol and 1- and 2- L43 alkenes. Oxidation of 2-pentanol to 2-pentanone was significantly slowed by the addition of alkenes. Terminal alkenes were more effective than 2-alkenes in retarding the oxidation of 2-pentanol. It should also be noted that the epoxidation of terminal alkenes was unaffected - or even slightly promoted - in the presence of 2-pentanol. This is in contrast to the decrease in the epoxidation of 2-alkenes upon the addition of 2-pentanol. The retarding effect of alkenes decreased with increasing chain length, consistent with the observed large decrease in diffusivity in zeolites with increasing chain length [ 15 ]. As shown in Table 3, the adsorption of 2-pentanol on titanium silicalite1 was not affected by the presence of 1-heptene. In contrast, the amount of adsorption of 1-heptene decreased slightly upon addition of 2-pentanol. Hence the decrease in the amount of 2-pentanol oxidation upon addition of alkenes is probably not due to prevention of adsorption of 2-pentanol into the zeolite pores, but rather to preferential interaction of alkenes with the Ti active site therein. It would be reasonable to attribute the different influences on selectivity between terminal and internal double bonds to their ability to coordinate to the Ti active site. The terminal CHz=CH- double bonds, being less sterically demanding, appear to be able to interact strongly with the Ti active site, preventing the alcoholic group from approaching the active site. The interaction of internal -CH=CH- double bonds with the active site is presumed to be considerably hindered owing to a steric effect. However, it should be noted that the reactivities were reversed in the case of epoxidation; a higher turnover for epoxidation of the internal double bond than for that of the terminal double bond would result from the electrophffic nature of the attack of active oxygen species against C=C bonds [16]. As a means of estimating the selectivity imposed by the zeolite structure, control catalytic runs were made using amorphous Ti02--SiO2 (pore radius: 5-2000 nm, Si/Ti = 26), which was prepared by hydrolysis of a mixture of Ti(OC2H5)4 and Sl(OCZH5)4. Representative data are illustrated in Fig. 1. Titanium silicalite-1 was more active and selective in the epoxidation of 2buten-l-of than Ti02-SiO2, which did not exhibit a preference for epoxidation over oxidation of the alcoholic group.

Gaining access to the active site may be difficult for the trisubstituted double bond. This was also the case for other unsaturated alcohols having asymmetrically disubstituted double bonds, CH2=CRR', as shown in Table 1 (entries 5 and 10). Such steric regulation was not encountered for Ti02--SiO2; epoxidation was promoted by the electron-releasing methyl substituent. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that titanium silicalite-I exhibits enhanced selectivity in the oxidation of unsaturated alcohols. The structure of the Ti active site is not yet well defined, however. The titanyl species was recently proposed as the active site [ 17 ]. Infrared measurements are currently being taken in order to clarify the mode of interaction of alkenes with the Ti active site. References 1 M. Taramasso, G. Perego and B.
