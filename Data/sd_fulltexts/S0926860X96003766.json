Choudhary*, V.H. Rane, S.T. Chaudhari Chemical Engineering Division, National Chemical Laboratory, Pune 411 008, India Received 3 May 1996; received in revised form 10 October 1996; accepted 14 October 1996 Abstract Surface properties (viz. acidity/acid strength distribution, basicity/base strength distribution, surface area, etc.) and catalytic activity/selectivity in oxidative coupling of methane at different reaction conditions (reaction temperature, 650-850; CH4/O2 ratio, 2.0-8.0 and GHSV (at STP) 51 600 cm3 g i h-l) of rare earth (La, Ce, Nd, Eu and Yb) promoted MgO with different rare earth/ Mg ratio have been thoroughly investigated. The surface and catalytic properties are found to be strongly influenced by the rare earth promoter and also by its concentration. The La-MgO, Ce- MgO and Eu-MgO showed high activity and selectivity in the OCM process and the performance of these catalysts is found to be comparable. The promotion of MgO by rare earths resulted in a large increase in the catalytic activity and selectivity and also in the basicity (both total and strong basic sites) but caused a decrease in the acidity (both number and strength of acid sites). A comparison of the catalysts showed that, the activity/selectivity in the OCM process depends not only on the strong basicity of the catalyst but also on the number and strength of its acid sites.

Introduction The alkali metal [1-7], PbO [8-10] and metal chloride [10-12] promoted MgO catalysts show high activity and selectivity in oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). However, in these catalysts the promoters are low melting and hence are evaporated from the catalyst during the high temperature process, causing catalyst * Corresponding author.

Choudhary et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 121-136 deactivation due to a loss of the active catalyst component. In order to avoid this problem, it is necessary to use high melting promoter in the OCM catalyst. In our earlier studies [ 13,14], we have found that MgO promoted by La203 (which is very high melting and hence not lost by evaporation) shows not only high activity and selectivity, particularly at very high space velocity but also shows very high productivity in the OCM process. Since this catalyst showed high promises for the OCM process, it is interesting to study in details the promoting action of other rare earths for the performance of different rare earth promoted MgO catalysts in the OCM process and also their surface properties. The present investigation was undertaken with the objectives of comparing different rare earths (viz. La, Ce, Nd, Eu and Yb) promoted MgO catalysts for their performance in the OCM process and also for their surface properties (viz. acidity/ acid strength distribution, basicity/base strength distribution, etc.). 2. Experimental The rare earth (viz. La, Ce, Nd, Eu and Yb) promoted MgO catalysts were prepared by mixing powdered magnesium acetate and the corresponding rare earth acetate (with desired rare earth to Mg ratio) in deionized water just sufficient to form a thick paste and drying at 120 for 12 h. The resulting dried mass was pressed binder-free, crushed to 22-30 mesh size particles and then calcined at 950 for 10 h in static air. The surface area of the catalysts was determined by the single point BET method by measuring the adsorption of N2 (30 mol% balance He) at liquid nitrogen temperature, using Monosorb Surface Area Analyzer (Quantachrome, USA). The surface acidity/acid strength distribution of the catalysts was determined by the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia (chemisorbed at 100) from 50 to 950 at a linear heating rate of 20 rain- l in a flow of moisture- free helium (20 cm3 min-1) in a quartz reactor. The surface basicity/base strength distribution of the catalysts was determined by the stepwise thermal desorption (STD) of CO2 (chemisorbed at 50) from 50 to 980 in a number of successive temperature steps (50-50, 150-300, 300-500, 500-700 amd 700-980) using helium as a carrier gas and measuring the desorbed CO2 quantitatively. The detailed procedure for measuring the acidity/basicity distributions are given elsewhere [ 15,16]. The OCM reaction over the catalysts was carried out in a continuous flow quartz reactor (i.d. 10 mm) provided with a Chromel-Alumel thermocouple in the catalyst bed. The catalyst was pretreated in situ in a flow of N2 (30 cm3 min-1) at 900 for 1 h. The feed was a mixture of pure methane and oxygen. The reaction was carried out at the following reaction conditions - amount of catalyst: 0.2 g, gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), measured at 0 and 1 atm pressure: 51 600 cm3 g-1 h-l, CHJO2 ratio in feed: 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0, and reaction tern- VR.

The reactor effluent gases, after removal of water by condensation at 0, were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph using Porapak-Q and Spherocarb columns. 3. Results and discussions 3.1. Catalyst characterization The values of surface area of the catalysts are presented in Table 1. In general, the surface area is increased due to the addition of rare earth metal promoter to MgO. However, for all the catalysts (except Nd-MgO), the surface area is found to decrease with increasing the rare earth/Mg ratio in the catalyst; the decrease in the surface area for the Ce-MgO catalyst is, however, larger. The NH3 TPD curves for the catalysts are presented in Figs. 1 and 2. The data on acidity of the catalysts (measured in terms of the ammonia chemisorbed at 100) are included in Table 1. The results show that the acidity is strongly influenced by the rare earth promoter and also by the rare earth/Mg ratio. The TPD curves show that the acidity distribution for all the reare earth promoted MgO catalysts are broad. Also, the observed peaks and/or shoulder peak for the TPD curves indicate the presence of acid sites of different strengths. All Dthe catalysts show the presence of weak (TPD peak at 150-250), an intermediate (TPD peak at 250- 450) and strong (TPD peak at >450) acid sites. However, the concentration of intermediate strength acid sites for all the catalysts is much higher than that of weak and strong acid sites. It is very interesting to note from the NH3 chemisorption and TPD data (Table 1 and Figs. 1 and 2) that both the acidity and strength of acid sites are decreased due to the addition of rare earth promoters to MgO. The decrease in the acid strength is evident from the shift of the TPD peaks towards the lower temperature side due to the promotion of MgO by the rare earths. Among the catalysts, Eu-MgO (Eu/Mg=0.005) and Yb-MgO (Yb/Mg=0.11) showed highest and lowest acidity, respectively. The basicity and base strength distribution on the rare earth promoted MgO (rare earth/Mg ratio=0.005 and 0.11) catalysts have been determined by the STD of CO2 (chemisorbed at 50) from 50 to 980 in a number of temperature steps (Figs. 3 and 4). The columns in Figs. 3 and 4 show the energy distribution of the sites involved in the chemisorption of CO2 at the lowest temperature of the STD (i.e. 50). Each column represents the number of sites measured in terms of CO2 desorbed during the corresponding step. The strength of these sites is expressed in terms of the desorption temperature of CO2, Td, which lies in the range in which the CO2 chemisorbed at the lowest temperature of the step is desorbed. The sites of strength TI<Td<T2 could be obtained from the amount of CO2 which was initially Table 1 Comparison of rare earth promoted MgO catalysts for their surface acidity/basicity and catalytic activity/selectivity in OCM at 800 (CH4/O2=8.0 and GHSV=51600cm3 g 1 h-l) e~ Catalyst Surface area NH3 chemisorbed CO2 chemisorbed CH4 conversion Selectivity (%) C2H4/C2H6 CO/CO2 ~- (me g-l) at 100 ~mol g-l) at 500 0amol g-l) (%) C2 C2+ MgO 14.3 149 33 8.6 37.6 43.1 0.28 1.07 ~ Catalysts with rare earth/Mg ratio=O.O05 La-MgO 26.0 89 97 17.0 68.3 73.7 0.78 0.18 Ce-MgO 19.5 35 80 19.8 65.3 71.5 0.92 0.12 Nd-MgO 14.9 17 157 14.1 53.1 57.0 0.59 0,35 ~.

The temperature dependence of CO2 chemisorption on the catalysts is shown in Figs. 5 and 6. The chemisorption of CO2 at higher temperature points to the involvement of stronger basic sites. Hence the CO2 chemisorption vs. temperature curves present a site energy distribution in which the number of sites are expressed in terms of the amount of CO2 chemisorbed as a function of chemisorption temperature. The results (Figs. 3-6) indicate that the basicity distribution on the catalysts is quite broad and all the catalysts contain basic sites of different strengths. Both the total basicity (measured in terms of CO2 chemisorbed at 50) and strong basicity (measured in terms of CO2 chemisorbed at 500) are increased due to the addition 126 V.R.

It can also be noted that the basicity distribution on the catalysts is changed with the change in the concentration of rare earth promoter in the catalysts. This indicates that the basicity/base strength distribution is strongly dependent on the rare earth promoter used and its con- centration. Earlier studies [17] showed that the incorporation of CaO into MgO for MgO- rich catalysts also causes increase in both the basicity and activity (in OCM). In this case also the ionic radius of Ca2+ is larger than that of Mg2+ and hence the high basicity results from the modification of surface structure. For the MgO-rich catalysts (_>85% MgO or Ca/Mg<0.18), CO2 adsorbed states (measured by IR- spectroscopy) were found to be same as those observed for pure MgO but with enhanced thermal stability, indicating surface modification by the CaO incorpora- V.R.

At the CO2 desorption temperature of _> 100, the adsorbed state of CO2 on the MgO-rich catalysts was found to be unidentate carbonate [17]. In the present case also all the catalysts are MgO-fich (rare earth/Mg_<0.11) and hence the state of the CO2 chemisorbed at the higher temperatures is also expected to be unidentate carbonate. 3.2.

The results showing the influence of temperature on the catalytic activity/selectivity, C2H4]C2H6 and CO/CO2 product ratios in OCM on the catalysts are presented in Figs. 7 and 8. From the results, following general observations have been made. Depending upon the rare earth promoter and its concentration, the influence of temperature on the activity and selectivity changes from catalyst to catalyst. Its conversion is passed through a maximum for the La-MgO, Nd-MgO (Nd/Mg=0.11) and Eu-MgO (Eu/Mg-0.11) catalysts. It is increased continuously for the MgO and Yb-MgO catalysts. Whereas, for the Ce-MgO and Eu-MgO (Eu/Mg=0.005) catalysts, it is increased at the lower temperatures but leveled-off at the higher temperatures. 130 V.R.

For all the catalysts, C2-selectivity, particularly at lower temperatures, is strongly affected by the reaction temperature (Figs. 7 and 8). At the lower temperature, it is generally increased with increasing the temperature. How- ever, for the Ce-MgO (Ce/Mg-0.11) and Eu-MgO (Eu/Mg--0.005) catalysts, the selectivity is passed through a maximum with increasing the temperature. The ethylene/ethane ratio for all the catalysts is increased with increasing the temperature (Figs. 7 and 8). This is consistent with the observation made earlier [5,12,16,18-22]. The increase in the ethylene/ethane ratio indicates that the conversion of C2H6 to C2H4 is favored at higher temperatures. It is expected due to the thermal decomposition of ethyl radicals and thermal cracking of ethane at higher temperatures. It may also be due to the increase in the rate of oxidative V.R.

The decrease in CO/CO2 ratio with increasing temperature indicates the formation of CO2 is more and more favored at higher temperatures. The influence of CI-I4/O2 ratio on CH4 conversion, C2-selectivity, C2H4/C2H6 and CO/COz product ratios in the OCM over the catalysts are shown in Figs. 9 and 10.

The increase in the ethylene/ethane ratio with decreasing the CH4/O2 ratio, which is also observed in the earlier studies [16,19,20], is most probably because of the availability of O2 at higher concentration for the following gas phase reactions involved in the formation of ethyl radicals and ethylene from ethane [20], C2H6 -F 02 --+ C2H5 +HO2\" (1) C2H5 +O2 --~ C2H4 + HO2\" (2) C2H6 + HO2' ----4 C2H5 +H202 (3) VR.

The influence of CH4/O2 ratio on the CO/CO2 ratio is, however, found to vary from catalyst to catalyst. 3.3. Role of rare earth promoters The rare earth promoted MgO catalysts (rare earth/Mg ratio=0.005 and 0.11) are compared with MgO (without any promoter) for their surface acidity (measured in 134 ER. Choudhary et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 121-136 terms of the NH3 chemisorbed at 100) and strong basicity (measured in terms of the CO2 chemisorbed at 500) and catalytic activity in the OCM (at 800, CH4/ 02 ratio=8.0 and GHSV=51 600 cm3 g-1 h-l) in Table 1. A comparison of the catalysts (Table 1) leads to the following important observations. Because of the presence of all the rare earth promoters, both the activity and selectivity of MgO in the OCM are increased very appreciably. The increase in the activity is, however, larger for the Ce-MgO (Ce/Mg=0.005 and 0.11) and Eu- MgO=0.11) catalysts and smaller for the Yb-MgO catalyst. The addition of rare earth promoter to MgO causes an increase in the strong basicity of the catalyst but a decrease in the acidity (both the number and strength of acid sites). The observed large increase in the strong basicity indicates creation of additional low coordi- nated (i.e. 4 and 3 coordinated) surface 02 species, responsible for the strong basicity. The strong basic sites present on the pure La203, CeO2, Eu203 and Yb203 are 24, 14, 20 and 12/.tmol g-l, respectively [16,19]. Since, the strong basic sites present on the pure rare earth oxides are much smaller than that observed for the rare earth promoted MgO, the increase in the strong basicity due to the rare earth promotion cannot be due to the presence of a separate rare earth oxide phase (observed by XRD for the catalyst with rare earth/Mg=0.11) in the catalysts. The observed increase in the strong basicity of the MgO due to its promotion by the rare earths is expected mostly because of the formation of additional low coordinated 02 surface sites by the incorporation of rare earth cations in the MgO lattice. Since, the radius of rare earth cations (0.092-0.102 nm) is larger than that of Mg2+ (0.065 nm), the rare earth cations cannot fit into the MgO lattice without causing its structural distortion. This is expected to result in surface oxygen species of low coordination [23]. Among the catalysts, Eu-MgO (Eu/Mg=0.11) La-MgO and Ce-MgO showed better activity and selectivity. In spite of their high basicity (strong basic sites), Nd- MgO and Yb-MgO catalysts showed lower activity and selectivity. The later two catalysts have, however, smaller number of acid sites and some of their acid sites are very strong (Figs. 1 and 2). As observed earlier [16], apart from the strong basic sites (which are essential for abstracting H from CH4 in the OCM process), surface acidity also seems to play an important role; the catalysts having strong acid sites showed poor C2-selectivity. In the present case also, both the activity and C2- selectivity for pure MgO and Eu-MgO (Eu/Mg=0.005) catalysts, having higher acidity in terms of both the number of acid sites and their strength, and also for Nd- MgO and Yb-MgO catalysts (having stronger acid sites) is lower than that of the other catalysts (Figs. 1 and 2 and Table 1). We have shown earlier [ 16] a possibility /~,,n+~2- where subscript LC denotes low of an involvement of acid-base pair tzwLC,-,LC, coordination) on the surface in the abstraction of the H-atom from adsorbed CH4 by its polarization followed by heterolytic C-H bond cleavage to form CH3 (interacting with the acid sites n+ MLC), and (OH)~c and a transfer of electron from the carbanion to 02, thus resulting methyl radical and O~-. A similar mechanism V.R. Choudhary et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 121-136 135 seems to be operative in the present case. Both the acid and strong basic sites are essential for the heterolytic C-H bond rupture. However, if the acid sites are stronger than that required for the bond rupture and/or large in number, the interaction of carbanions (CH3) with the acid sites is expected to be strong, resulting in the oxidation of the strongly adsorbed CH3 to COx by surface reactions thus ultimately reducing the selectivity in the OCM. Interactions of olefins with the acid sites, which favor surface catalyzed combustion, also result in a decrease in the selectivity. The lower selectivity of Eu-MgO (Eu/Mg=0.005) is attributed mostly to its larger number of acid sites. However, the lower activity of Nd-MgO and Yb-Mgo catalysts is expected because of their smaller number of acid sites. Thus, the comparison of the catalyst shows that, the activity/selectivity in the OCM process depends not only on the strong basicity of the catalyst but also on the number and strength of its acid sites. 4. Conclusions From the studies on the acidity/basicity distributions and catalytic activity/ selectivity (in the OCM process) of the rare earth promoted MgO catalysts (viz. La-MgO, Ce-MgO, Nd-MgO, Eu-MgO and Yb-MgO with rare earth/Mg ratio of 0.005 and 0.11), following important conclusions can be drawn: 1. The surface properties (viz. surface area, acidity/acid strength distribution, basicity/base strength distribution) and the catalytic activity/selectivity of rare earth promoted MgO catalysts in the OCM process are strongly influenced by the rare earth promoter and also by its concentration. All the rare earth promoted MgO catalysts have broad acid and base strength distributions. Among these catalysts, the La-, Ce- and Eu-promoted MgO catalysts show high activity and selectivity and hence high promises for their use in the OCM process. The performance of these three catalysts is, however, comparable. 2. The promotion of MgO by the rare earths results in a large increase in its both total and strong basic sites (measured in terms of the chemisorption of CO2 at 50 and 500, respectively) but causes a decrease in both the number and strength of its acid sites. 3. Because of the promotion of MgO by the rare earths, its catalytic activity/ selectivity in the OCM is increased pronouncedly. This is mostly due to the increase in its strong basic sites and the decrease in both the number and strength of surface acid sites. The OCM activity/selectivity of the catalyst is controlled not only by its strong basic sites but also by its acid sites, their number and strength. If the acid sites are too large or too small in numbers or stronger than that required, the catalyst shows poor activity/selectivity in the OCM process. 136 V.R.
