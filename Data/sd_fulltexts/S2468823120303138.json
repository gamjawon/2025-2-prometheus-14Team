Graphical abstract Cr/Al2O3 catalysts with strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) are prepared by a controlled H2 reduction process, exhibiting enhanced catalytic stability and anti-coking capability for propane dehydrogenation. Chromium oxide supported on aluminum oxide (Cr/Al2O3) is one of the most widely used catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, a major problem of this catalyst system is fast deactivation due to the serious coke formation. Here we propose a hydrogen reduction method to adjust the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Cr species and Al2O3 support. It is found that the strength of SMSI increases with the increase of H2 pretreated temperature, and the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst with stronger metal-support interaction exhibits higher catalytic stability toward PDH. Characterizations reveal that the SMSI over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts can decrease the desorption barrier of propylene, avoiding cracking and deep dehydrogenation, and thus, increasing the catalyst stability and anti-coking ability. After 20 h time on stream, no obvious catalytic activity loss can be observed over the 700 °C-reduced Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, demonstrating a very promising PDH catalyst. Furthermore, the SMSI in Cr/Al2O3 system can be extended to other Cr-based catalysts such as Cr/ZrO2. This study might open a new way to design and develop highly stable Cr-based catalysts with controlled catalytic activity and selectivity. Keywords Propane dehydrogenation Strong metal-support interactions Chromium oxide Propylene Hydrogen reduction 1 Introduction Supported metal catalysts are one of the most widely used catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis [1,2]. The interaction between metal and supports (SMSI: strong metal-support interactions) plays an important role in determining the catalyst performance [3–6]. Specifically, SMSI was firstly reported on VIII group metals supported on TiO2 that the adsorption of CO and H2 on catalysts would be obviously suppressed after high-temperature H2 pretreatment [7]. With the development of SMSI, the supports were extended to many other reducible metal oxides, such as Ta2O5, NbO2, V2O5, CeO2 and ZnO, and the migration of supports onto the active phases could be observed over these catalysts [8–11]. Generally, the formation of SMSI can change the surface properties of supported catalysts, influencing their catalytic performance; and then, some new catalysts are exploited [12–14], and their catalytic mechanisms are identified [15,16]. While, new discoveries and understanding of SMSI may make great influence on the supported catalysts and may result in an innovation in catalyst development and application. Over the last several years, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn great attention due to the growing demand of propylene and the increasing production of propane from shale gas [17–20]. In particular, CrOx species supported on Al2O3 have been demonstrated to be very efficient catalysts for PDH [21–24]. However, a great challenge for this catalyst system is the serious coke formation during the catalytic process, which significantly shortens the catalyst life. To improve the stability and anti-coking capability of Cr-based catalysts, a number of methods have been used, such as improving the porosity, decreasing the acidity and/or doping with heteroatoms, however, no obvious improvement has been achieved [23–27]. The development of an efficient and stable Cr/Al2O3-based catalyst for PDH is still a great challenge. Alternatively, introduction of SMSI into the Cr/Al2O3 catalysts may be an efficient way to improve the catalytic stability of Cr catalysts in PDH reaction [3–11,28]. However, it has long been deemed that non-reducible supports were inert which possessed no SMSI behavior [8,9,29,30]. Until recently, it was found that SMSI could be introduced into Al2O3 and SiO2 supported catalyst system by high-temperature treatment the catalysts in a reductive atmosphere [31–36]. For instance, Zhong and co-workers reported that SMSI could be introduced into Pt/Al2O3 catalysts after pretreated in hydrogen atmosphere at a high temperature of 800 °C, i.e., forming of a Pt8Al21 alloy at the Pt-Al2O3 interface [31]. Wang et al. reported the presence of SMSI in H2-reduced Fe/Al2O3 catalysts, and the formation of SMSI can significantly influence the reduction, carburization and CO/H2 adsorption properties, and thereby influence their catalytic performance in Fischer–Tropsch synthesis [32]. Furthermore, SMSI was found in Fe/SiO2 catalysts that silicate groups would be formed on the surface of Fe particles after H2 treatment at 350 °C for 16 h [33]. Very recently, Deng et al. reported that SMSI could be introduced into Pt/SiO2 catalysts by H2 pretreatment at a high temperature (over 500 °C), and the as-prepared Pt/SiO2 catalysts with SMSI exhibited enhanced catalytic performance for PDH reaction [34]. Inspired by the above-mentioned strategies, herein, Cr/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by a wet-impregnation method, and subsequently pretreated in hydrogen atmosphere at different temperature. The nature of Cr species and the structural properties of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS, TEM, H2-TPR, C3H8/C3H6/NH3-TPD, TGA and N2 sorption techniques. It is revealed that the SMSI can be introduced into Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, which is rarely reported before. Importantly, the presence of SMSI can significantly improve the catalytic stability of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts in PDH reaction. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials and catalyst preparation Cr(NO3)3·9H2O was purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chem. Co. Al2O3 was obtained from Tianjin Shenneng Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. The Cr/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by a wet impregnation method. In a typical procedure, 2 g of Al2O3 was added into 20 ml solution containing calculated amount of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O. After vigorous stirring for 30 min, the mixture was dried at 90 °C for 12 h. The resultant solid was then calcined in a muffle furnace at 600 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1, and denoted as Cr/Al2O3-fresh. Pretreatment of the fresh catalyst: The obtained fresh Cr/Al2O3 catalyst was reduced under pure H2 (20 ml min−1) for 2 h at different temperature and named as Cr/Al2O3-x (x represents the pretreated temperature). Furthermore, the H2 reduced Cr/Al2O3 catalysts were further oxidized in a muffle furnace at 600 °C for 1 h and subsequently pretreated in H2 at 600 °C for 1 h (heating rate, 5 °C min-1). 2.2 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on a Rigaku Mini Flex II diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation), operating at 40 mA and 40 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a Jeol JEM-2800 microscope at 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were tested on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer equipped with an argon ion (Ar+) sputtering gun. For depth-profile analysis, the sample was sputtered in Ar+ for 2 min (twice) before the test. All the spectra were corrected by carbon at 284.8 eV. Hydrogen temperature-programed reduction (H2-TPR) and ammonia/propane/propylene temperature-programed desorption (NH3/C3H8/C3H6-TPD) experiments were performed on Quantachrome CHEMBET3000. For H2-TPR tests, 50 mg of sample was degassed in He flowing (20 ml min−1) at 500 °C for 1 h. Then, the sample was cooled down to room temperature. 10 % H2/Ar (20 ml min−1) passed through the sample until the baseline flat. Afterwards, the sample was heated to desired temperature with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. For NH3-TPD tests, 200 mg of sample was degassed in He flowing (20 ml min−1) at 500 °C for 1 h. Then, the sample was cooled down to 80 °C and subsequently saturated with 5%NH3/Ar (20 ml min−1) for 30 min. After that, the samples were purged by He flowing (20 ml min−1). Until the baseline flat, the sample was heated to desired temperature with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. For C3H8/C3H6-TPD tests, 200 mg of sample was degassed in He flowing (20 ml min−1) at 500 °C for 1 h. Then, the sample was cooled down to 80 °C and subsequently saturated with pure C3H8 or C3H6 (20 ml min−1) for 30 min. After that, the samples were purged by He flowing (20 ml min−1). Until the baseline flat, the sample was heated to desired temperature with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The coke contents of the spent catalysts were detected by a thermogravimetery analyzer (TGA, TA SDT Q600). The heating rate and air flowing rate of all the tested samples are 10 °C min−1 and 100 ml min−1, respectively. The porosities of the prepared catalysts were measured by nitrogen sorption analysis (Quantachrome NOVA 2000e) at 77 K. Before the tests, all the samples were degassed in vacuum at 200 °C for 6 h. The specific surface areas were calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The pore volumes were obtained at the relative pressure (P/P 0) of 0.99. 2.3 Catalytic study The propane dehydrogenation tests were carried out in a fixed-bed micro-reactor at atmospheric pressure. Typically, 0.2 g catalyst (sieve fraction 425–600 μm) was put into a quartz tube (5 mm i.d.). Then, the reactant gas (N2/C3H8 = 19:1) was fed to the catalyst. The total flow rate was 20 ml min−1, corresponding to a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 6000 mL h−1 g−1. Then, the reactor was heated to desired temperature and maintained for 10 min. The outlet products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC, SP-6890). The propane conversion and propylene selectivity were calculated as follows: (1) C 3 H 8 Conversion ( mol % ) = moles of C 3 H 8 reacted moles of C 3 H 8 fed × 100 (2) C 3 H 6 S e l e c t i v i t y ( m o l % ) = m o l e s o f p r o d u c t C 3 H 6 f o r m e d m o l e s o f C 3 H 8 r e a c t e d × 100 The deactivation rates of the PDH catalysts were calculated as follows: (3) k d = ln 100 - C e C e - ln 100 - C s C s t where k d (h−1) is the deactivation constant, Cs and Ce are propane conversions at the start and end of the experiments respectively, t (h) is the reaction time. The sample with low k d value possesses high catalytic stability. 3 Results and discussion In order to make clear the influence of H2 pretreated process on the catalytic performance of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, all the PDH tests were carried out at the same conditions (Fig. S1). Noticeably, the propane conversions of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts decrease with elevated the H2 pretreated temperature, while their propylene selectivity increases with the increase of H2 pretreated temperature. Apart from the catalytic activity and selectivity, the H2 pretreated temperature can significantly affect the catalytic stability of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. As shown in Fig. 1 a, the deactivation rates of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts progressively decrease with the increase of H2 pretreated temperature. In particular, Cr/Al2O3-700 shows almost no activity loss during the 20 h time on stream (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, the N2 sorption results (Fig. S2) show that only a slight change of the porous structure can be detected over the Cr/Al2O3-700 after 20 h time on stream (S BET = 215 m2 g−1, V total = 0.32 cm3 g−1), which is much better than Cr/Al2O3-fresh after 5 h time on stream (S BET = 138 m2 g−1, V total = 0.25 cm3 g−1). The TG results of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts after 300 min time on stream show that the coke contents on Cr/Al2O3 catalysts decrease with the increase of H2 pretreated temperature (Fig. 1c). Especially, Cr/Al2O3-700 and Cr/Al2O3-800 catalysts show a small weight loss of 1.3 %, which is much lower than that of fresh Cr/Al2O3 catalyst (5.7 %). After 20 h time on stream, only a weight loss of 2.8 % can be observed over the Cr/Al2O3-700, suggesting the high anti-coking capability of Cr/Al2O3-700 (Fig. S3). The color of the used Cr/Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. S4) is in good accordance with the TG results, i.e., Cr/Al2O3-fresh (black), Cr/Al2O3-500 (black), Cr/Al2O3-600 (black), Cr/Al2O3-700 (gray) and Cr/Al2O3-800 (gray). The black color of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts must be due to the coke formation. Fig. S5 shows the TEM images of Cr/Al2O3-fresh and Cr/Al2O3-700 after 5 h time on stream. An obvious graphite carbon layer can be observed over the Cr/Al2O3-fresh after 5 h time on stream (Fig. S5a), which can be attributed to coke deposits [37,38]. While no graphite carbon layer can be seen over the Cr/Al2O3-700 after 5 h time on stream (Fig. S5b). This indicates that the H2 pretreatment process can effectively reduce the coke formation onto the Cr/Al2O3 during PDH reaction, in good accordance with the TG results in Fig. 1c. For better understand the changes of the surface properties of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, C3H8-TPD and C3H6-TPD experiments were carried out (Figs. S6 and 1 d). As to fresh Cr/Al2O3, an obvious C3H8 desorption signal can be observed in the temperature range of 150–650 °C. After H2 pretreatment, the C3H8 desorption signal of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts decreases obviously. In particular, the Cr/Al2O3-800 possesses a very weak C3H8 desorption signal, indicating the remarkable change of its surface properties. Fig. 1d shows the C3H6-TPD curves of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. Clearly, the fresh Cr/Al2O3 shows two obvious peaks in the temperature range of 200–450 °C and 450–600 °C, respectively. As to H2 pretreated Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, their C3H6 desorption signals decrease with the increase of H2 pretreated temperature. Particularly, the C3H6 desorbed peaks of Cr/Al2O3-700 and Cr/Al2O3-800 shift to lower temperature, indicating the decrease of interactions between C3H6 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts [39–41]. In PDH reaction, strong adsorbed reaction intermediates (such as propylidyne species) are believed to be coke precursors which can be polymerized and formed graphitic sheets to cover active sites [17,42–45]. After H2 pretreatment, the adsorbed C3H6 on Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are obviously suppressed, and thus, leading to enhanced catalytic stability and anti-coking capability. The structural properties of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are characterized by N2 sorption technique (Table S1 and Fig. S7). The BET surface area and pore volume of all the H2 pretreated Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are similar to those of fresh Cr/Al2O3, and all the Cr/Al2O3 catalysts possess a high surface area over 200 m2 g−1. Fig. S8 shows the TEM and EDS elemental mapping images of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. It is shown that all the Cr/Al2O3 catalysts possess worm-like pores. The corresponding EDS elemental mapping images reveal that the Cr species are homogeneously dispersed onto the Al2O3 supports. These results illustrate that the H2 pretreatment process makes little influence on the porous structure and Cr dispersion of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. The crystallite structure and acidic properties of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are characterized by XRD (Fig. S9) and NH3-TPD (Fig. S10) techniques, respectively. All the XRD patterns and NH3-TPD curves of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are similar to those of Al2O3 support, indicating that the H2 pretreatment process makes little influence on the crystallite structure and acidic properties of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. The influences of H2 pretreatment process on the Cr states of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are investigated by H2-TPR and XPS techniques. As shown in the H2-TPR results (Fig. S11), only the fresh Cr/Al2O3 catalyst possesses an obvious H2 consumption signal in the temperature range of 300–600 °C, which can be attributed to the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) [46–48]. However, no H2 consumption peaks can be observed over the H2 pretreated Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, illustrating that the Cr species have been transformed into a stable state. The detail Cr 2p XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 2 a, it is notable that all the H2 pretreated Cr/Al2O3 samples possess two obvious peaks at the binding energies of 576.8 and 586.6 eV, corresponding to the Cr3+ 2p3/2 and Cr3+ 2p1/2, respectively [46,47]. In particular, the strengths of Cr 2p XPS spectra of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts decrease with the increase of H2-reduction temperature. It is known that the XPS technique can only detect the surface compositions of metal oxides. The decrease of Cr signal over the Cr/Al2O3 catalysts indicates the decrease of Cr species on the external surface of the as-prepared samples [34,49–51]. To better understand the structure of H2 pretreated Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, the as-synthesized Cr/Al2O3-800 was sputtered in Ar+ for 2 min (twice). Noticeably, an obvious increase of the Cr 2p XPS feature can be observed over the sputtered Cr/Al2O3-800 catalyst (Fig. 3 b), revealing that the Cr species would be encapsulated by Al2O3 layers in Cr/Al2O3-800 sample [49,52]. Furthermore, the Cr/Al2O3-800 was calcined in a muffle furnace at 600 °C for 1 h and subsequently reduced in H2 at 600 °C for 1 h. Noticeably, a strong increase of Cr 2p XPS signal can be observed, indicating the Cr species migrate onto the external surface of Al2O3 support. The corresponding C3H8-TPD curve of Cr/Al2O3-800 after oxidation is provided in Fig. S12, showing an obvious C3H8 desorption signal, which is similar to that of fresh Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. This indicates that the structure of Cr/Al2O3-800 recovers to that of fresh Cr/Al2O3 sample, which is a key feature of SMSI behavior in supported catalysts [11,50]. To make clear the changes of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts during H2 pretreatment process, we designed an experiment by grinding Cr2O3 and Al2O3 (Cr2O3-Al2O3) and subsequently pretreated the Cr2O3-Al2O3 mixture in H2 atmosphere at 600 °C for 1 h. As shown in the TEM image (Fig. 3a), some large particles can be clearly observed over the Al2O3 support. EDS mapping (Fig. 3c) and high resolution TEM images (Fig. 3d) reveal that these particles are crystallite Cr2O3 (interplanar crystal spacing of 0.362 nm, (0 1 2) crystallite plane of Cr2O3). Besides, many highly dispersed Cr species can be clearly observed in the Al2O3 support, while no obvious Al species can be observed on the Cr2O3 particles (Fig. 3b and c). This indicates that the Cr species migrate from Cr2O3 to Al2O3 rather than Al2O3 migrate upon Cr2O3. Many previous studies have reported that the supports could migrate onto the surface of metal particles during the H2 reduction process in supported catalysts with SMSI, which would dramatically change the physicochemical properties of catalysts [4–11,50,53]. Differently, Keturakis et al. found that Cr species could be incorporated (and/or dissolved) into the Fe2O3 support in CrO3/Fe2O3 catalyst during water-gas shift reaction [51]. Herein, it is found that the active Cr species migrate into the Al2O3 support during H2 pretreatment, which is similar to CrO3/Fe2O3 catalyst [51]. To better understand the structure of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, the Cr/Al2O3-700 catalyst was re-oxidized in muffle furnace at 600 °C for 1 h and subsequently reduced in H2 at 600 °C for 1 h. Then, the resultant Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are tested in PDH for several times. As shown in Fig. 3e, the catalytic activity of Cr/Al2O3-700 can recover after oxidation, in well agreement with previous reported metal supported catalysts that the catalytic activity of the catalysts can recover upon O2 treatment [4,11,50,53,54]. This further illustrates that the Cr species could migrate onto the external surface of Al2O3 support in an oxidation atmosphere, resulting in a reversible catalytic performance. The above characterizations, especially XPS and C3H6-TPD, reveal that SMSI can be introduced into Cr/Al2O3 catalysts by high-temperature H2 pretreatment, which is rarely reported before [17,18,55–57]. Importantly, the Cr/Al2O3 catalysts with SMSI exhibit enhanced catalytic selectivity and stability for PDH. Combining with the PDH results, it can be concluded that the activity change of Cr/Al2O3 can be divided into two parts. At low H2 pretreated temperature (≤600 °C), the Cr/Al2O3 catalysts possess almost no SMSI. So, no obvious change of the catalytic activity can be observed over the Cr/Al2O3-fresh, -500 and -600. When the H2 pretreatment temperature is higher than 600 °C, the activity decreases of Cr/Al2O3 must be due to the increase encapsulation of Cr species into Al2O3. In Fig. 4 , we proposed the possible catalytic mechanism of fresh and H2 pretreated Cr/Al2O3 catalysts in PDH reaction. For fresh Cr/Al2O3 catalyst without SMSI, substantial deactivation can be attributed to the serious coke formation (Fig. 4a and b). After high temperature H2 pretreatment (>600 °C), the SMSI could be formed upon Cr/Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. 4c). Typically, the active Cr species would migrate into the Al2O3 substrate during H2 pretreated process, forming a core-shell structure. The formation of SMSI can significantly decrease the interactions between C3H6 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. 1d), and thus, avoiding deep dehydrogenation, cracking and coke formation. To extend the SMSI to other metal oxides, we prepared a series of Cr/ZrO2 catalysts through a wet impregnation method and subsequently pretreated in H2 at different temperature. It is shown that the Cr/ZrO2 catalysts show similar PDH performance to that of Cr/Al2O3 catalyst system (Fig. S13), indicating that SMSI can be extended to other Cr-based catalysts. 4 Conclusions This work reports the strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) could be introduced into Cr/Al2O3 catalyst system. It possesses many classical SMSI characterizations like noble metal supported catalysts: 1) actives phase migrates into the substrate (as evidenced by XPS and Ar+ sputtering experiment; 2) reduction of reactant molecular adsorption and catalytic activity (as evidenced by C3H8/C3H6-TPD and PDH tests); 3) improved the catalytic and thermal stability; 4) reversible catalytic performance under high temperature reductive and oxidative pretreatment. More importantly, the formation of SMSI can significantly improve the catalytic stability and anti-coking capability of Cr/Al2O3 catalyst toward PDH reaction.

        "dc:description": "Chromium oxide supported on aluminum oxide (Cr/Al2O3) is one of the most widely used catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, a major problem of this catalyst system is fast deactivation due to the serious coke formation. Here we propose a hydrogen reduction method to adjust the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Cr species and Al2O3 support. It is found that the strength of SMSI increases with the increase of H2 pretreated temperature, and the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst with stronger metal-support interaction exhibits higher catalytic stability toward PDH. Characterizations reveal that the SMSI over Cr/Al2O3 catalysts can decrease the desorption barrier of propylene, avoiding cracking and deep dehydrogenation, and thus, increasing the catalyst stability and anti-coking ability. After 20 h time on stream, no obvious catalytic activity loss can be observed over the 700 °C-reduced Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, demonstrating a very promising PDH catalyst. Furthermore, the SMSI in Cr/Al2O3 system can be extended to other Cr-based catalysts such as Cr/ZrO2. This study might open a new way to design and develop highly stable Cr-based catalysts with controlled catalytic activity and selectivity.",
