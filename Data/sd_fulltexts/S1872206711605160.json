In our approach, the active phase precursor MoS3 was first prepared using thioacetamide and sodium molybdate as sources of S and Mo, respectively, and ethanol as a dispersant. The precursor was deposited onto the surface of a Î³â€�Al2O3 support and heatâ€�treated to form the catalyst. The catalyst was characterâ€� ized by N2 adsorptionâ€�desorption, Xâ€�ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and highâ€�resolution transmisâ€� sion electron microscopy. The HDS activity of the catalyst was assessed using dibenzothiophene as a model reactant. The catalyst possessed larger specific surface area and pore volume, higher disperâ€� sion and degree of sulfidation of Mo species, and shorter and more suitable stacking of MoS2 slabs, resulting in superior catalytic activity compared with a catalyst with the same metal content preâ€� pared by the conventional impregnation method. Ethanol could disperse the precursor MoS3 partiâ€� cles via â€œSâ€¦Hâ€�Oâ€� Hâ€�bonding to lessen their aggregation. Â© 2013, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Keywords: Hydrodesulfurization catalyst Hydrolysis Ethanolâ€�assisted preparation Molybdenum trisulfide Molybdenum disulfide Â Â Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is an important process in the modern petroleum refining industry that is used to produce clean transportation fuels. Developing HDS catalysts with imâ€� proved activity is the most costâ€�effective approach to increase the efficiency of HDS [1]. Mo/Al2O3 catalysts containing MoS2 as the active phase have been the main commercial HDS catalyst system for more than half a century [1,2]. It is generally acâ€� cepted that there are two types of MoS2 active phases: type I and type II [2â€“5]. The type I phase usually consists of stacked monolayers and thus is well dispersed. However, it interacts strongly with the support alumina via Moâ€�Oâ€�Al linkages, which leads to poor sulfidation of Mo species and thereby lowers the activity of the MoS2 active phase. In contrast, the type II phase is highly stacked and interacts weakly with the support alumiâ€� na, resulting in full sulfidation of Mo species and thereby higher activity of the MoS2 active phase. For this reason, increasing the dispersion of active metal sulfides to obtain sufficient active sites while weakening the metalâ€�support interaction to proâ€� mote the sulfidation of Mo species has been the main focus in preparing highâ€�efficiency HDS catalysts [6]. The commercial preparation of Moâ€�based HDS/ hydrotreatâ€� ing catalysts is usually realized by impregnating Î³â€�Al2O3 extruâ€� dates with an aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate, followed by aging, drying and calcining to produce oxidic MoO x /Al2O3 catalysts that are sulfided prior to use with sulfidaâ€� tion agents such as a mixture of H2S and H2 [2].

DOI: 10.1016/S1872â€�2067(11)60516â€�0 | http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/18722067 | Chin. J. Catal., Vol. 34, No. 4, April 2013 SHI Gang et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 659â€“666 have shown that in the conventional impregnation process [7â€“9], the heptamolybdate anions interact strongly with the surface of alumina, giving rise not only to an eggshellâ€�like uneâ€� ven distribution of the Mo species, but also strong Alâ€�Oâ€�Mo linkages after calcination, which leads to incomplete sulfidation and thereby the formation of type I phase with low activity. Importantly, during impregnation of the support, readily soluâ€� bilized aluminum species present in alumina can react with heptamolybdate anions to form Andersonâ€�type heteropolyanâ€� ions, e.g., Al(OH)6Mo6O18 3â€“ , which are transformed into bulk MoO3 crystals and Al2(MoO4)3 species during calcination [10,11]. These two species are difficult to fully sulfide, and therefore detrimental to the performance of the resulting cataâ€� lysts [10]. The combination of wellâ€�dispersed metal species with a high degree of sulfidation cannot be achieved using the conventional preparation method. In addition, the onâ€�site sulâ€� fidation of HDS catalysts in the form of oxides using sulfidation agents such as methyl disulfide also possesses some problems, such as long startâ€�up time, serious equipment corrosion, and potential hurt to human body [12]. For this reason, there has been a growing tendency to use presulfided HDS/hydrotreating catalysts in the refining industry in recent years. In general, the procedure used to prepare presulfided catalysts involves two steps: the deposition of sulfided precursors, such as soluble thiomolybdate or thiotungstate salts, into the pores of the supâ€� port, and highâ€�temperature thermal treatment of the supported sulfided precursors to obtain the active phases [13â€“15]. These methods are still being developed, and require further investiâ€� gation. Herein we report a novel strategy to directly prepare a sulâ€� fided Mo/Al2O3 HDS catalyst using MoS3 nanoparticles as the precursor of the active phase. In our approach, MoS3 particles are first synthesized by homogeneous precipitation between thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2, TAA) and MoO4 2â€“ anions in the presence of H + at about 84 Â°C, to which a given amount of ethâ€� anol is added to control the size of the MoS3 particles. These MoS3 nanoparticles are then deposited onto the surface of aluâ€� mina to obtain the precursor MoS3/Al2O3 composite. Finally, a sulfided Mo/Al2O3 catalyst with high dispersion and sulfidation degree of Mo species is successfully obtained by reduction of the MoS3/Al2O3 composite at high temperature in the presence of H2. For comparison, another sulfided MoS2/Al2O3 catalyst with identical Mo content was prepared by the conventional impregnation method. The two catalysts are characterized by N2 adsorptionâ€�desorption, Xâ€�ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and highâ€�resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and their HDS performance is evaluated using dibenzothiophene (DBT) as a model reactant. Except for Î³â€�Al2O3 pellets (20â€“40 mesh, surface area 215 m 2 /g, pore volume 0.51 ml/g, Shandong Aluminum Plant, the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China), all of the chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade. Typical ethanolâ€�assisted chemical deposition was carried out as follows. First, aqueous HCl (4.5 ml, 0.24 mol/L) was added into a stirred aqueous solution (30 ml) of sodium moâ€� lybdate (Na2MoO4, 0.006 mol/L) and TAA (0.019 mol/L). Anâ€� hydrous ethanol (30 ml) was added dropwise to the stirred solution and the resulting solution was transferred to a 100â€�ml rotary Teflonâ€�lined stainless steel autoclave containing Î³â€�Al2O3 extrudates (3.0 g) and heated at 84 Â°C for 24 h. The resulting MoS3/Al2O3 composite (denoted EAâ€�MoS3/Al2O3) was filtered, washed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol, respecâ€� tively, and then dried at 50 Â°C in N2 atmosphere for 6 h. EAâ€�MoS3/Al2O3 was then treated in H2 flow at 500 Â°C for 4 h, yielding the MoS2/Î³â€�Al2O3 catalyst (denoted EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT). The MoO3 loading in EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT determined by Xâ€�ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF, Rigaku ZSXâ€�100e) was 16 wt%. For comâ€� parison, a conventional catalyst with the same MoO3 content was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of Î³â€�Al2O3 extrudates with an aqueous solution of ammonium molybdate. The impregnated extrudates were dried at 120 Â°C for 2 h and then calcined at 500 Â°C for 4 h in air to yield an oxidic MoO3/Al2O3 composite, which was sulfided with a mixture of 3 wt% CS2 in cyclohexane at a temperature of 300 Â°C, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of 8 h â€“1 , total pressure of 4.0 MPa, and H2/hydrocarbon volumetric ratio of 400 to obtain the sulâ€� fided catalyst (denoted IMâ€�CAT). In addition, to determine the role of ethanol in the preparation process, another sulfided catalyst, EFâ€�Sulâ€�CAT, with the identical MoO3 content was also prepared by the same procedure as used for preparing EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT, except that water was used instead of anhydrous ethanol in the second step. Precursors and catalysts were characterized by HRTEM (Philips Tecnai G2 F20) using a primary electron energy of 200 keV and Cs of 0.5 mm, energyâ€�dispersive Xâ€�ray spectrometric (EDX) analysis conducted on a Linkâ€�ISISâ€�300 spectrometer, and N2 adsorptionâ€�desorption measurements (Micromeritics ASAP 2002, USA). XPS measurements were obtained on a spectromâ€� eter (VG ESCA Lab 250) using Al KÎ± radiation and were deconâ€� voluted using XPSPEAK software (Version 4.1). It is well known that under acidic conditions above 80 Â°C, TAA undergoes slow hydrolysis to release H2S, as expressed in Equation (1) [13]. The resulting H2S molecules immediately react with the surrounding MoO4 2â€“ anions and H + cations to produce MoS3 nanoparticles, as expressed in Equation (2) [16, 17]. The generated MoS3 nanoparticles continuously diffuse into the pores of alumina where they deposit on the pore surâ€� face, forming an MoS3/Al2O3 composite. MoS3 species are very unstable in H2 atmosphere at high temperature and are readily reduced into MoS2 species [16â€“18], as shown in Equation (3), which renders MoS3 species an excellent precursor of active phase MoS2. Therefore, MoS2/Al2O3 catalysts can be easily obâ€� tained by thermal treatment of MoS3/Al2O3 composites in H2 atmosphere. 322 3 42 3CH CSNH + 6H O 3CH COONH +3H Sï‚®ï‚­ (1) + 42 3 2 MoO +3H S+2H MoS +4H Oï‚®ï‚¯ - (2) o 500 C 32 22 MoS +H MoS +H Sï‚¾ï‚¾ï‚¾ï‚¾ï‚® (3) Figure 1(a) shows the HRTEM image of the precursor EAâ€�MoS3/Al2O3 composite. The surface of alumina is coated with amorphous MoS3 species, which was confirmed by EDX analysis [16â€“18]. However, once the precursor was heatâ€�treated under H2, the resulting catalyst EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT conâ€� tained numerous dispersed MoS2 nanocrystallites of uniform SHI Gang et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 659â€“666 size with suitable stacking on the surface of alumina, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Further analysis of the lamellar crystallites by HRTEM revealed that the interlamellar spacing was ca. 0.62 nm, indicating they are MoS2 species [19]. The transformation of MoS3 phases into MoS2 ones was also demonstrated in S 2p XPS spectra and their fitting results obtained for EAâ€�MoS3/Î³â€�Al2O3 and EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT, as shown in Fig. S1 in the Supporting Information. Table 1 lists the specific surface areas, pore volumes, and average pore diameters of the support and catalysts obtained by N2 adsorptionâ€�desorption measurements. While both cataâ€� lysts possess lower surface areas and pore volumes than the Î³â€�Al2O3 support, IMâ€�CAT exhibits much larger decreases in surâ€� face area, pore volume and average pore diameter than EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT because the formation of larger MoS2 particles blocked the narrower pores of the support [6]. In contrast, EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT prepared by ethanolâ€�assisted chemical deposition has smaller MoS2 particles that do not obviously affect the texâ€� tural properties of the catalyst, as shown in the HRTEM images below. Mo 3d XPS spectra of EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT and IMâ€�CAT and their deâ€� convolutions are presented in Fig. 2. It is widely accepted [20â€“22] that the degree of sulfidation of Mo species, Mo sulfidation, can be defined as the ratio of Mo 4+ to the sum of Mo 4+ and Mo 6+ , which can be calculated from deconvoluted XPS spectra; the results obtained are listed in Table 2. Mo sulfidation is 96.8% for EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT and only 67.1% for IMâ€�CAT. Because Mo sulfidation depends inversely upon the metalâ€�support interaction, the higher Mo sulfidation of EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT suggests a weaker metâ€� alâ€�support interaction than in IMâ€�CAT [6,23], further proving that ethanolâ€�assisted chemical deposition effectively avoids the formation of strong Alâ€�Oâ€�Mo linkages. For IMâ€�CAT, however, the strong interaction between Mo species and the Î³â€�Al2O3 support results in incomplete sulfidation [10,11]. The unaâ€� voidable formation of bulk MoO3 crystals and Al2(MoO4)3 speâ€� cies further reduces the sulfidation of Mo species [24]. In addition to providing information on the degree of sulfiâ€� dation, XPS has also been used to characterize the dispersion and accessibility of active sites to reactants in terms of the surâ€� (a) (b) Fig. 1.

The surface Mo/Al atomic ratios measured for EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT and IMâ€�CAT are listed in Table 2. Despite their identical metal content as deâ€� termined by XRF, EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT has a much higher surface atomic ratio than IMâ€�CAT prepared by the conventional method, showing much higher dispersion and accessibility of the active sites to reactants. Xâ€�ray powder diffraction analysis of the cataâ€� lysts (not shown) also indicated that EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT contained wellâ€�dispersed Moâ€�based particles. Figure 3 shows representative HRTEM micrographs of EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT and IMâ€�CAT, in which the black threadâ€�like fringes correspond to MoS2 slabs. Analyzing the statistical results of the length and stacking layer number distributions of MoS2 slabs (not shown) revealed that in the EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT catalyst, MoS2 nanoslabs are well dispersed on the support with a much narrower size distribution and a higher stacking degree than those in sulfided IMâ€�CAT. Moreover, Table 3 shows that the MoS2 nanoslabs in EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT have a smaller average length (3.3 nm) and a higher stacking degree (3.0 layers) compared with those in IMâ€�CAT (4.8 nm and 2.6 layers, respectively). These results indicate that EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT not only has more active sites exposed to reactants, but it also possesses higher intrinsic activity because of its more suitable stacking than that in IMâ€�CAT [4,5]. DBT is a representative sulfurâ€�containing compound found in petroleum and petroleum refining products and therefore was chosen to evaluate the performance of the HDS catalysts prepared in the present investigation. The HDS activities of the two sulfided Mo/Î³â€�Al2O3 catalysts, EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT and IMâ€�CAT, are shown in Table 3. The reaction rate constant (KHDS), turnover frequency (TOF) and HDS ratio obtained over EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT are all much higher than those over IMâ€�CAT. By considering the characterization results, the difference between the HDS activiâ€� ties of the two sulfided catalysts can be explained as follows. On one hand, as mentioned above, EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT contains better dispersed and more fully sulfided Mo species than IMâ€�CAT, providing more active sites exposed to the reactants and thereby leading to the increased values of KHDS and HDS ratio [1]. On the other hand, the strong interaction between the Mo species and alumina in IMâ€�CAT prepared by conventional imâ€� pregnation favored the formation of type I active sites with low intrinsic activity, whereas the weakened interaction between the Mo species and alumina in EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT prepared by ethaâ€� nolâ€�assisted chemical deposition resulted in almost complete sulfidation of Mo species, generating more type II active sites with intrinsically high activity and thus giving a considerably higher TOF value [5]. Overall, the ethanolâ€�assisted chemical deposition method we have developed produces catalysts with better dispersion and a higher degree of sulfidation of the acâ€� tive Mo species than those prepared by conventional methods. Both of these factors enhance the activity of catalysts prepared by ethanolâ€�assisted chemical deposition. HDS of DBT proceeds through two pathways: one is the diâ€� rect desulfurization (DDS) route to produce biphenyl (BP), and the other is through hydrogenation (HYD) to form cyclohexâ€� ylbenzene (CHB) with tetrahydrodibenzothiophene (THDBT) and hexahydrodibenzothiophene (HHDBT) as intermediates [7]. The selectivity for various products and DDS/HYD ratios are given in Table 3. For the two catalysts studied, the preferâ€� ential HDS route is DDS. The higher selectivity for BP and the much higher DDS/HYD ratio for EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT compared with those for IMâ€�CAT suggest the former has higher selectivity for DDS. The CHB selectivity over EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT is much higher than that over catalyst IMâ€�CAT, indicating the higher HDS activity of the former and revealing the potential of EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT for deep HDS [6,7].

SHI Gang et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 659â€“666 The above characterization and activity results show that the Mo species in EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT possess higher dispersion, degree of sulfidation and HDS performance than those of IMâ€�CAT. We noticed that ethanol plays an important role in tuning the size and morphology of the MoS2 nanoparticles during their forâ€� mation. Figure 4 shows a HRTEM image of EFâ€�Sulâ€�CAT preâ€� pared by chemical deposition without ethanol. Compared with EAâ€�Sulâ€�CAT prepared using ethanol, as shown in Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 3(a), the MoS2 nanoparticles in EFâ€�Sulâ€�CAT possess much larger average length (7.8 vs. 3.3 nm) and much higher stacking (5.0 vs. 3.0 layers), illustrating the ability of ethanol to reduce the size of the precursor MoS3 nanoparticles and their derived MoS2 nanoparticles. Correspondingly, the larger size of the MoS2 nanoparticles in EFâ€�Sulâ€�CAT resulted in fewer active sites, and thereby lower HDS activity, as shown in Table 3. The ethaâ€� nol molecules help to disperse the precursor MoS3 nanopartiâ€� cles [14,26] because the Sâ€�rich surface of the MoS3 nanopartiâ€� cles may allow them to interact with ethanol molecules via â€œSâ€¦Hâ€�Oâ€� hydrogen bonds. Once MoS3 particles form, ethanol molecules can be quickly adsorbed onto the surface of each particle, which may lessen their aggregation and help to control particle size. In conclusion, we successfully developed an ethaâ€� nolâ€�assisted chemical deposition method to directly prepare sulfided Mo/Al2O3 HDS catalysts. Compared with the convenâ€� tional impregnation method, our method produces catalysts with higher dispersion and degree of sulfidation of active metal species, which greatly improves their HDS activity. In the prepâ€� aration process, ethanol molecules disperse the precursor MoS3 nanoparticles, helping to control the size of the active MoS2 particles.

In our approach, the active phase precursor MoS3 was first prepared using thioacetamide and sodium molybdate as sources of S and Mo, respectively, and ethanol as a dispersant. The precursor was deposited onto the surface of a γ-Al2O3 support and heat-treated to form the catalyst. The catalyst was characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The HDS activity of the catalyst was assessed using dibenzothiophene as a model reactant. The catalyst possessed larger specific surface area and pore volume, higher dispersion and degree of sulfidation of Mo species, and shorter and more suitable stacking of MoS2 slabs, resulting in superior catalytic activity compared with a catalyst with the same metal content prepared by the conventional impregnation method. Ethanol could disperse the precursor MoS3 particles via “S…H-O” H-bonding to lessen their aggregation. 摘要 以硫代乙酰胺为硫源, 14;钼酸钠为钼源, 14;乙醇为分散剂, 14;采用化学沉积法制备了MoS3/Al2O3催化剂前驱体, 14;再用H2高温处理得到高分散硫化型MoS2/γ-Al2O3催化剂, 14;运用N2吸附-脱附、X射线光电子能谱以及高分辨透射电子显微镜等技术对MoS2/γ-Al2O3催化剂进行了表征, 14;并以二苯并噻吩作为模型化合物评价了催化剂的加氢脱硫(HDS)活性. 结果表明, 14;与浸渍法相比, 14;所制催化剂具有更大的比表面积和孔体积、更高的活性金属分散度、更佳的Mo物种硫化度以及更短的MoS2片层长度和更高的堆积度, 14;因而在二苯并噻吩HDS反应中表现出远优于浸渍法所制催化剂的活性. 乙醇可通过S…H-O氢键吸附至MoS3纳米粒子表面, 14;可有效防止其生长和团聚, 14;起到分散剂的作用. 14; Graphical abstract This communication presents a novel strategy to prepare a MoS2/Al2O3 hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalyst.
