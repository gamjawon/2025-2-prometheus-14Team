DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60358-6 ARTICLE Preparation of Nickel Phosphide/Mesoporous-TiO 2 Catalyst and Its Hydrodesulfurization Performance YANG Zhuhong*, LI Licheng, WANG Yanfang, LIU Jinlong, FENG Xin, LU Xiaohua State Key Laboratory of Materials-Oriented Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Technology, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, China Abstract: Using mesoporous TiO 2 (m-TiO 2 ) as the support, novel nickel phosphide/m-TiO 2 catalysts (Ni 2 P/m-TiO 2 ) were prepared by a temperature-programmed reduction method. The influence of the Ni/P molar ratio and the amount of active component on the catalyst structure and the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) performance was investigated. The results indicated that the reduction of precursor with Ni/P = 1.25 yielded mainly Ni 2 P, and the optimum loading of Ni was 10%. The influence of m-TiO 2 on the preparation and HDS performance of nickel phosphide catalysts was also evaluated by X-ray diffraction, N 2 physisorption, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction. The results showed that m-TiO 2 with high crystallinity could dramatically decrease the reduction temperatures of Ni and P species. When the reduction temperatures were between 450 and 600 Â°C, the textures of the Ni 2 P/m-TiO 2 catalysts were very similar and the specific surface areas were about 90 m 2 /g. The effects of the support on the dibenzothiophene HDS performance of the nickel phosphide catalysts were also investigated. The results showed that the order of dibenzothiophene conversion was Ni 2 P/m-TiO 2 > Ni 2 P/SiO 2 > Ni 2 P/P25. Key words: mesoporous; titania; nickel phosphide; hydrodesulfuriztion; dibenzothiophene Transition-metal phosphides are new types of materials. They have special physical and chemical properties and have been widely studied in a range of research fields [1â€“4]. Tran- sition-metal phosphides are effective in the hydrodesulfuriza- tion (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation of petroleum. The cata- lytic properties of Ni 2 P are better than those of noble metals [1,5]. Ni 2 P has similar properties to those of noble metals and is promising for oil-processing applications. Normally, Ni 2 P catalysts have small specific surface areas (< 10 m 2 /g) and cannot fully exert their catalytic properties [6]. One method for improving the catalytic properties of Ni 2 P is to load it onto a support with a high specific surface area. Com- monly used supports include Al 2 O 3 [7], SiO 2 [5], SBA-15 [8], ultra-stable zeolite-Y [9], absorbite [10], and MCM-41 [11]. The surface properties and structure of the support have a significant influence on the synthesis and catalytic properties of transition-metal phosphides [12]. -Al 2 O 3 is a typical hy- drogenation catalyst support, but it is not a suitable support for phosphates because -Al 2 O 3 interacts strongly with P to form phosphoaluminate[13]. SiO 2 is a traditional stable catalyst support, and shows high selectivity and catalytic activity after loading with Ni 2 P. S iO 2 has been chosen as the support for Ni 2 P in many studies [14]. A new support, TiO 2 , is better than inert supports for facilitating electron transfer [15]. Low-oxida- tion-state molybdenum is formed and HDS catalyst selectivity and activity are improved [16,17]. Wang et al. [18] found that TiO 2 improves the catalytic properties of Ni 2 P catalysts. Ni 2 P/TiO 2 composites have large numbers of active centers and low acidity [19,20]. Typically, TiO 2 has a low specific surface area, usually less than 50 m 2 /g [21,22], and rutile is formed at 550 Â°C [23]. Normally, TiO 2 cannot keep its structure, and phase transitions and structural deterioration occur when YANG Zhuhong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 508â€“517 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) methods are used to prepare Ni 2 P catalysts [24]. The low specific surface area and thermostability are therefore obstacles in catalyst preparation. He et al. [25] used ion-exchange with titanate as the pre- cursor and calcination at 500 Â°C to prepare highly crystalline mesoporous TiO 2 (m-TiO 2 ) with a specific surface area of 100 m 2 /g and uniform pores. The as-prepared TiO 2 had high ther- mostability, and after calcination at 600 Â°C the specific surface area was still 59 m 2 /g [26]. The anatase structure was fully maintained after calcination at 900 Â°C [27]. We used the as-prepared TiO 2 as a support for Ni 2 P, and the catalyst showed good properties in the hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol [28], CO oxidation [26,29], esterification [30], and reductive hydrogen production [31,32], proving that the catalyst has a wide range of applications. In this study we use the above method to prepare m-TiO 2 as the support and TPR method to prepare Ni 2 P/mesoporous TiO 2 catalyst. The support was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N 2 adsorption-desorption, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and TPR. The HDS properties were evaluated using a dibenzothiophene (DBT)/decahy- dronaphthalene system to simulate diesel. 1 Experimental 1.1 Sample preparation The preparation of the Ni 2 P catalyst consisted of two steps: preparation of the support, and reduction. In the first step, (NH 4 ) 2 HPO 4 (Xi Long Chemical Plant) solution was added dropwise to a Ni(NO 3 ) 2 Â·6H 2 O (Heng Xin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) solution in a given molar ratio, and a small amount of HNO 3 (Zhong Shi Chemical Corporation) was added dropwise to the solution until the yellow precipitate formed was dis- solved. m-TiO 2 (prepared as in Ref. [25]) was then added to the solution, and the solution was stirred. Heating at 120 Â°C and calcination at 500 Â°C for 2 h gave the support precursor. In the second step, the precursor was treated in a N 2 atmosphere (flow rate 100 ml/min) at 200 Â°C for 2 h and then in a H 2 atmosphere (flow rate 150 ml/min) at 3 Â°C/min, and kept at a given tem- perature for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the catalyst was inactivated in a N 2 atmosphere for 1 h (flow rate 60 ml/min); the as-prepared catalyst was designated by Ni 2 P/m-TiO 2 . P25 (Degussa, specific surface area 50 m 2 /g, anatase:rutile = 4:1) and SiO 2 (Degussa) loaded with Ni 2 P using the same method were used as references, and the re- duction temperature was set at 650 Â°C, based on the literature; they were designated by Ni 2 P/P25 and Ni 2 P/SiO 2 . 1.2 Characterization XRD was performed using a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker, Germany; Cu K , tube current 30 mA, tube potential 40 kV, 5Â°â€“60Â°, 0.05Â°/step, 0.2 s/step). H 2 -TPR was performed using a TP-5000 instrument (Tianjing Xianquan Co., Ltd.). The precursor was treated under a N 2 atmosphere (flow rate 20 ml/min, 200 Â°C) for 2 h and cooled to room temperature. A 10% H 2 -90% N 2 mixture was heated to a given temperature at a rate of 10 Â°C/min; the gas flow rate was 20 ml/min. A thermal conductivity cell was used to measure H 2 consumption. The specific surface area and pore distribution of the precursor were characterized using a TristarII 3020M (Micromeritics). The specific surface area and pore volume were measured using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner- Halenda (BJH) methods. The surface structure was character- ized by FESEM (Hitachi S-4800, 5 kV). 1.3 Activity evaluation The HDS properties were evaluated in a mini fixed-bed re- actor (self-made, see Ref. [33]). The length of the pipe was 500 mm, and the internal diameter was 9.4 mm. The catalyst was shaped under a pressure of 12 MPa and then shattered. After screening, 20â€“40 mesh was chosen. The catalyst (0.333 g) was diluted with quartz-sand (1.5 g) of the same mesh, loaded into the reactor, and treated under a H 2 atmosphere (flow rate 60 ml/min, 400 Â°C) for 2 h to remove the surface passivation layer; 0.5% dibenzothiophene (DBT, Acros Organ- ics)/decahydronaphthalene (Siopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) was used to simulate diesel oil. The pressure was 2.0 MPa, the H 2 flow rate was 40 ml/min, and the air speed was 12 h 1 . After pre-reaction for 4 h, the resulting product was col- lected every hour. A SP-2000A gas chromatograph (fixed phase: PEG-20MËˆ0.32 mm Ã— 30 m, flame ionization detector; Shandong Lunan Ruihong Chemical Apparatus Co., Ltd.) was used. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Nickel phosphide structure Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of Ni 2 P/m-TiO 2 obtained from various initial Ni/P molar ratios at an initial loading of 20% Ni and a reduction temperature of 650 Â°C. At 2 = 40.7Â°, 44.6Â°, and 47.3Â°, obvious diffraction peaks were found. These were Ni 2 P diffraction peaks (PDF 03-0953). This indicates that different Ni/P molar ratios in the precursor can result in dif- ferent crystal phases of the catalyst. When the molar ratios were 0.5, 1, and 1.25, the active ingredient was Ni 2 P, but when the molar ratio reached 2, the peak of the Ni 2 P phase declined and the Ni 12 P 5 phase emerged. This is the result of the reduction of P to volatile PH 3 [34]. Wang et al. [11] reported that the catalytic activity of Ni 12 P 5 is lower than that of Ni 2 P. Li et al. [35] found that the Ni 2 P XRD peaks increased with increasing initial molar ratio of Ni/P from 1/3 to 1/2. Keeping the Ni content constant and varying the amount of P favors the for- YANG Zhuhong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 508â€“517 mation of Ni 2 P crystals. In this paper, with increasing Ni/P molar ratio, the excess of P decreases, so the conditions for formation of the Ni 2 P phase become less favorable, and the intensities of the Ni 2 P diffraction peaks decrease. The follow- ing results show that the reduction temperature of Ni 2 P de- creased on the support consisting of an m-TiO 2 precursor, and the low temperature decreased P leakage. Increasing the molar ratio of Ni/P and the formation of inert Ni 12 P 5 can therefore be avoided. Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of Ni 2 P/m-TiO 2 with various Ni loadings at an initial Ni/P molar ratio of 1.25 and a reduction temperature of 650 Â°C. The figure shows that when the Ni loading reached 5%, no Ni 2 P peak was found, indicating good distribution of Ni 2 P on the support. However, when the Ni loading reached 10%, a small Ni 2 P peak emerged. With further increase in the Ni loading, the diffraction peak of Ni 2 P/m-TiO 2 became more obvious. Based on the reflex crystal face of Ni 2 P(201) (2 = 44.6Â°), using the Scherrer equation, we cal- culated that for Ni loadings of 15% and 20%, the particle di- ameters of Ni 2 P on the catalyst surface were 18.4 and 26.1 nm, respectively, indicating that as the Ni loading increased, the particle diameter of the active ingredient, Ni 2 P, increased and the dispersity decreased. Figure 3 shows the effects of catalysts prepared at different Ni/P ratios on HDS performance (reaction temperature 340 Â°C) for a Ni loading of 10% and a reduction temperature of 650 Â°C. As shown in Fig. 3, the optimum HDS activity is obtained when the Ni/P ratios are 1 and 1.25; the conversion rate reaches about 92%. When the Ni/P ratio rises to 2, the HDS perform- ance of the catalyst drops to 47%. These results show that the Ni/P ratio has a significant effect on the HDS performance. When the ratio is low, the active component is largely Ni 2 P, and the HDS performance of the corresponding catalyst improves as the ratio increases. When the ratio is further increased to 2, Ni 12 P 5 is present in the components, leading to a decrease in HDS performance. When nickel phosphide is loaded on SiO 2 [5], absorbite [10], or MCM-41 [11], the optimum HDS activ- ity is obtained because the active components largely consist of Ni 2 P. Th e TiO 2 support is not an exception. In conclusion, the Ni/P ratio should be slightly lower than 2, the theoretical value that guarantees that the main constitute of the active compo- nent is Ni 2 P. In this study, the optimum ratio of Ni/P was found to be 1.25. Figure 4 shows the influence of Ni 2 P loading on Ni 2 P/m-TiO 2 catalysts and their HDS properties at a Ni/P ratio of 1.25, a reduction temperature of 650 Â°C, and a reaction temperature of 340 Â°C. When the Ni loading was 5%, the DBT conversion was only 21%, and when the loadings reached 10% and 15%, the DBT conversions were 72%. When the Ni load- ing reached 20%, the conversion decreased to 62%. Combined with the XRD analysis, these results suggest that the loading content and dispersion both have an effect on the HDS prop- erties. The HDS properties decrease as a result of the lack of catalytic activity centers when the Ni 2 P content is low, and as a result of poor Ni 2 P dispersion on the support at high contents. The best Ni 2 P loading is 10% by Ni content. 20 30 40 50 60 Ni/P = 0.5 Ni/P = 1.25 Ni/P = 2.0 Ni/P = 1.0 m-TiO 2 Ni 2 P Ni 12 P 5 I n t e n s i t y 2 ( o ) Fig. 1.

YANG Zhuhong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 508â€“517 2.2 Reduction activity of the catalyst at low temperatures Figure 5 shows the H 2 -TPR profiles of the nickel phosphide precursor (Ni loading 10% and molar ratio of Ni/P 1.25) doped on various supports. As the figure shows, the reduction tem- peratures of the precursor loaded on m-TiO 2 are 450 and 540 Â°C. The low-temperature peak corresponds to reduction of Ni, and the second peak corresponds to the reduction of P. The reduction of Ni and P occur almost simultaneously. In the TPR process, Ni is reduced first. The generated Ni adsorbs H 2 , which is dissociated to active hydrogen, and this promotes the reduction of P, and further reaction to Ni 2 P [36]. XRD analysis supports this view, and the Ni 2 P/m-TiO 2 surface begins to ap- pear at a Ni 2 P reduction temperature of 500 Â°C. As the reduc- tion temperature increases to 650 Â°C, the intensity of the Ni 2 P diffraction is enhanced (Fig. 6). Lu et al. [37] hydrolyzed TiCl 4 to obtain amorphous TiO 2 , which acts as a precursor for the preparation of Ni 2 P. It was discovered that when the reduction temperature exceeded 300 Â°C, NiO and TiO 2 reacted to give NiTiO 3 , which is difficult to be reduced. As the TPR profiles show, the sharp and narrow reduction peaks of NiTiO 3 and NiO both emerge at around 700 Â°C. Our groupâ€™s previous research [38] indicates that amorphous TiO 2 is more reactive than crystalline TiO 2 . In this research, we chose amorphous TiO 2 of high crystallinity as the support. It can promote electron transfer and enhance HDS activity. Crystalline TiO 2 can re- strain the generation of NiTiO 3 , and this in turn significantly decreases the reduction temperatures of Ni and P. TPR testing of a precursor based on P25 indicated that, compared with inert carriers such as SiO 2 crystalline TiO 2 can promote the genera- tion of nickel-phosphorus compounds. Based on the XRD analysis of Ni 2 P/P25 preparation at a reduction temperature of 500 Â°C, we conclude that Ni 12 P 5 is first generated on the P25 surface. 2.3 Thermostability of catalyst TPR studies showed that the TiO 2 support contributed to the formation of Ni 2 P at low temperature, it is necessary to inves- tigate the structural stability and HDS properties at low tem- peratures. Table 1 shows the structure of the Ni 2 P/m-TiO 2 catalyst and TiO 2 support at reduction temperatures of 450â€“650 Â°C. The specific surface area of m-TiO 2 is 132.5 m 2 /g, and the pore volume and average pore size of the support are suitable for a catalyst support.

For a Ni/P molar ratio of 1.25 and an active ingredient loading of 10%, the specific surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter of the obtained cata- lyst decreased as a result of diffusion of the active ingredient into the mesopores of the support. When the reduction tem- perature was 450â€“600 Â°C, the specific surface area was 90 m 2 /g. When the temperature reached 650 Â°C, the structure collapsed, but the specific surface area was still more than 60 m 2 /g, which is larger than that of the Ni 2 P/P25 catalyst. XRD shows that the crystal phase is anatase, indicating that the Ni 2 P/m-TiO 2 catalyst has high thermostability. Figure 7 shows the FESEM images of the precursor treated at various reduction temperatures. The images show that the TiO 2 support has a large number of mesopores, but it is difficult to see the average mesopore distribution in the precursor. Treatment under a H 2 atmosphere at 500 or 650 Â°C increases the amount of Ni 2 P clusters, seen in the images as white balls, on the catalyst surface. These clusters are evenly distributed on the m-TiO 2 . The cluster size dose not increase with increasing treatment temperature. Figure 8 shows the effects of HDS reduction temperature on the catalytic activity of obtained Ni 2 P/m-TiO 2 compared with that of P25-supported catalyst. It can be seen that the DBT conversion is between 70% and 80% for different temperatures between 450 and 650 Â°C. For the catalysts prepared at 450 and 650 Â°C, the DBT conversion rates are slightly lower. This is because when the reduction temperature is low, less Ni 2 P is formed, reducing the number of active catalytic sites, and this contributes to the decrease in the performance of the HDS catalyst. However, for the Ni 2 P/P25 catalyst prepared at a reduction temperature of 500 Â°C, the DBT conversion rate is only 26%. This is attributed to the smaller surface area and the possibility of Ni 12 P 5 formation on the surface. 2.4 Comparison of performance of different supports loaded with Ni 2 P Figure 9 shows a comparison of the HDS performance of nickel phosphide on various supports at Ni loading of 10%, initial Ni/P molar ratio of 1.25, and reduction temperature of 650 Â°C. Although the specific surface area of Ni 2 P/m-TiO 2 is smaller than that of Ni 2 P/SiO 2 (Table 1), the HDS properties are best for the m-TiO 2 support. The order of the HDS per- formance on different supports is Ni 2 P/m-TiO 2 > Ni 2 P/SiO 2 > Ni 2 P/P25. This indicates that Ni 2 P supported on TiO 2 can en- hance the HDS ability. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies by Lu et al. [37] showed that peaks of Ni and P on the TiO 2 passivation layer shift towards lower binding energies due to the moving of electrons on Ti surface to Ni 2 P, which en- hances the HDS activity of the Ni 2 P catalyst.

YANG Zhuhong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 508â€“517 3 Conclusions A novel Ni 2 P/m-TiO 2 catalyst was prepared by the TPR method. The m-TiO 2 with high crystallinity could significantly decrease the reduction temperatures of Ni and P species and promote the formation of Ni 2 P. When the reduction tempera- ture was between 450 and 600 Â°C, the Ni 2 P/m-TiO 2 catalyst had good thermal stability and HDS performance. The effects of the supports on HDS performance showed that TiO 2 can enhance the HDS performance, and m-TiO 2 gave the best performance. References 1 Oyama S T.

Tel/Fax: +86-25-83172251 Using mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) as the support, novel nickel phosphide/m-TiO2 catalysts (Ni2P/m-TiO2) were prepared by a temperature-programmed reduction method. The influence of the Ni/P molar ratio and the amount of active component on the catalyst structure and the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) performance was investigated. The results indicated that the reduction of precursor with Ni/P = 1.25 yielded mainly Ni2P, and the optimum loading of Ni was 10%. The influence of m-TiO2 on the preparation and HDS performance of nickel phosphide catalysts was also evaluated by X-ray diffraction, N2 physisorption, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction. The results showed that m-TiO2 with high crystallinity could dramatically decrease the reduction temperatures of Ni and P species. When the reduction temperatures were between 450 and 600 °C, the textures of the Ni2P/m-TiO2 catalysts were very similar and the specific surface areas were about 90 m2/g. The effects of the support on the dibenzothiophene HDS performance of the nickel phosphide catalysts were also investigated. The results showed that the order of dibenzothiophene conversion was Ni2P/m-TiO2 > Ni2P/SiO2 > Ni2P/P25. 摘要 以介孔 TiO2 (m-TiO2) 为载体, 采用程序升温还原法制备了 Ni2P/m-TiO2 催化剂, 考察了不同起始 Ni/P 摩尔比及活性组分负载量对该催化剂结构及其催化加氢脱硫 (HDS) 性能的影响. 结果表明, 当 Ni/P 摩尔比为 1.25 时, 活性组分以 Ni2P 为主, 催化剂的最佳 Ni 负载量为 10%. 采用 X 射线衍射、低温 N2 吸附-脱附、场发射扫描电镜和程序升温还原等技术表征了 m-TiO2 及其它不同载体负载的 Ni2P 催化剂. 结果表明, 高结晶度 m-TiO2 载体使 Ni 和 P 物种的还原温度大幅度降低, 在 450–600 oC 还原制得的 Ni2P/m-TiO2 催化剂的结构参数基本一致, 比表面积均为 90 m2/g 左右, 具有很高的热稳定性和对二苯并噻吩的 HDS 催化性能. 在相同的反应条件下, m-TiO2 负载的 Ni2P 催化剂 HDS 性能最好, 各载体负载的 Ni2P 催化剂活性大小顺序为 Ni2P/m-TiO2 > Ni2P/SiO2 > Ni2P/P25.
