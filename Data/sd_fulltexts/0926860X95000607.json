Catalyst preparation and catalytic properties Jiyan Zhang *, Yanji Wang, Liu Chang Department of Chemical Engineering, Tianjin University, 300072 Tianjin, People's Republic of China Received 18 February 1995; accepted 24 February 1995 Abstract A novel sulfur-tolerant methanol synthesis catalyst M0SZ/KZC03/Mg0-Si02 has been developed and investigated. Using the information from thermodynamic analysis and the reaction path of the syngas system, a preliminary catalyst design for methanol synthesis has been put forth. A series of experiments relating to the effect of alkali and alkaline earth promoters and acid-base supports on the catalytic properties has been tested and discussed. Under the conditions of 533 K, 8.1 MPa, 3000 h-', HZ/CO= 1.42 and 1350 ppm sulfur content, the conversion of carbon monoxide is 36.1%, methanol selectivity 53.2%, space-time yield of methanol 180.3 g/l,at h, which is much higher than what is so far published in the literature. Keywords: Methanol synthesis; Promoter effect; Reaction conditions; Selectivity (methanol); Sulfide catalyst; Support effect 1. Introduction Catalytic production of methanol is an important industrial process, and Cu0Zn0-A1203 is a well known catalyst for that purpose. One of its serious setbacks, however, is its high sensitivity to sulfur. Usually an expensive desulfurization plant is, therefore, established for sulfur containing stock. In view of the short supply of low sulfur content material, it is necessary to develop new processes to handle high sulfur feedstocks, such as residual oil and coal. One way to meet this is to develop a sulfur-tolerant methanol catalyst. Some work has been done for lower alcohols on sulfide catalysts [ 1-7 ] , but very little on methanol synthesis. In this paper, the preparation of a new sulfide catalyst * Corresponding author. E-mail yhzhou@bepc2.ihep.ac.cn, fax. ( +86-22) 3358329. 0926-860X/95/$09.50 SSDI 0926-860X (95) 00060-7 L206 J. Zhang et al. /Applied Catalvsis A: General 126 (1995) L205-L218 for methanol synthesis is presented and the effects of promoters and supports as well as reaction conditions are investigated and discussed. 2. Thermodynamic analysis and catalyst design In our earlier work [ 8 ] it was shown that within the system of carbon monoxide hydrogenation there exist 9 individual reactions and these can be categorized into 3 groups: (1) formation of hydrocarbons (methane and higher hydrocarbons), (2 ) formation of alcohols (methanol and higher alcohols) and (3) water-gas shift reaction. In the equilibrium state, the methane, water and carbon dioxide content is much higher than that of other products. For methanol synthesis, methane and water formation should be suppressed. During methanation and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis carbon monoxide undergoes dissociation, while in methanol synthesis it does not; therefore it is very important to control the dissociative adsorption of carbon monoxide. Molybdenum disulfide has a good catalytic activity for hydrogenation of carbon monoxide and is sulfur tolerant. It is selected as the primary catalyst. Alkali and alkaline earth compounds are used as the promotor to improve methanol selectivity. An appropriate support, apart from providing a good configuration, could have some function in modulating the interactions between the primary catalyst and promoters, as well as the acidity and basicity of the catalyst. The supports used, M90-Si02 and Li20-y-A]203 are chosen with this in mind. 3. Experimental 3.1. Reagents Molybdenum disulfide (MOS2) The molybdenum disulfide was (1) obtained from a commercial source; (2) prepared in the laboratory. This was done by bubbling hydrogen sulfide into ammonium molybdate solution to form (NH4) ZMOS4, which was decomposed to molybdenum disulfide at 723 K under hydrogen and nitrogen atmosphere. Promoters Alkali and alkaline earth carbonates were obtained from commercial sources. Support As supports were used: (1) M90-Si02 prepared in the laboratory by mixing and grinding laboratory made silica gel and magnesium hydroxide to form a uniform mixture, which was then dried at 393 K and calcined at 823 K in an air oven.

Preparation MoSzlalkali or alkaline earth carbonate/support catalysts These catalysts were prepared under nitrogen atmosphere, by mixing and grinding the necessary ingredients, then pelleting and crushing to 20-40 mesh particles, which are calcined for 2 h at 623 K in a quartz tube reactor, in a pure nitrogen stream, then cooled down to room temperature either directly for activity evaluation or stored under inert atmosphere for characterization. Co(Ni)-Mo-S-K catalyst The solution of ammonium molybdate and cobalt (nickel) nitrate was mixed with ammonium sulfide solution, stirred for 4 h, and vacuum filtered. The precipitate was dried at 333 K, temperature-programmed to 723 K and kept at that temperature for 3 h, then cooled down to room temperature in a nitrogen stream. The cold substance was mixed with potassium carbonate, and calcined again as before. The surface area and pore size of the above prepared catalysts are listed in Table 1. 3.3. Activity evaluation Activity evaluation was carried out under high pressure in a fixed bed flow system with a stainless steel tube of 8 mm I.D. The sample of 20-40 mesh was placed in the constant-temperature zone of the reactor. The feed gas was a semi-water-gas obtained from a methanol plant with a sulfur content of 1350 ppm (Fig. 1) . 4. Results and discussion 4.1.

Alkali and alkaline earth carbonates The results are tabulated in Table 2. It can be seen that without promoters there is no alcohol formed, the only product is hydrocarbon, in which methane is the dominant species. With promoters the carbon monoxide conversion is lowered, but alcohols are formed. Such a notable change must be due to the formation of a new active phase between molybdenum disulfide and the promoters. Among these promoters potassium carbonate is an outstanding one. Effect of potassium content As shown in Fig. 2, with increasing potassium content, carbon monoxide conversion drops quickly at first, then slowly. The methanol selectivity increases steadily and reaches a maximum at about 20 wt.-% potassium carbonate.

Effect of potassium loading in molybdenum sulfide on selectivity and the activity. 1,209 tells us that potassium plays an important role in decreasing the carbon monoxide hydrogenation activity as well as methane selectivity at one side, and on the other side, in promoting the formation of methanol and raising its selectivity. Besides, it is worth while to note that the quantity of potassium carbonate added is 20 wt.-% of the molybdenum disulfide, much higher than that generally used simply as an electronic promotor. So high a quantity of potassium carbonate probably is needed for forming a composite sulfide, something like MoS~ ~ xKZS (x < 1), which offers a new carbon monoxide hydrogenation site specifically for methanol synthesis. Since molybdenum sulfide is the primary catalyst, responsible for the overall activity, too much potassium carbonate will clearly decrease the degree of conversion, and the yield of methanol as well, therefore there exists an optimum potassium content. Effect of cobalt, nickel promotor Fig. 3 shows the effect of addition of cobalt or nickel nitrate ( in wt.-% of the catalyst); either of which enhances the activity, yet lowers the alcohol selectivity. Alcohols are lower by 48.4% and 53.6%, and hydrocarbons higher by 28.0% and 30.8% respectively, as compared with potassium carbonate. The effect can also be expressed as the ratio of methanol to higher alcohols and methane to higher hydrocarbons, both of which, as shown in the figure, are decreased. This means that cobalt and nickel are beneficial to carbon chain propagation. 4.2. Effect of support Single support Table 3 gives the effect of different supports on MoSz/KZC03 as considered from various aspects. With respect to activity (in terms of carbon monoxide conversion), the sequence is Mg0 < activated carbon < y-A1203 < Si02. In relation L210 J.

These two sets of data indicate that the acidity and basicity of the support have to be considered to adjust the catalyst activity and selectivity. Of these supports, silica is good for carbon monoxide conversion and magnesium oxide for high methanol selectivity. Non of them alone can give both high activity and methanol selectivity, but a combination of the two may impart proper acid/base properties to the catalyst for high methanol yield. Combined support M90-Si02 Fig. 4a shows the change of activity versus mol-% of magnesium oxide in the Mg0-Si02 support. With increasing magnesium oxide content, carbon monoxide conversion goes rapidly up with a peak at about 60 mot-%, and a conversion up to Table 3 Reaction behavior of MoS2/KZC03 on different supports Support CO conv.

In this case magnesium oxide plays the main role and silica acts as a modifier. Because magnesium oxide provides a certain basicity to the catalyst, favoring alcohol formation, and it behaves somewhat like potassium carbonate does towards molybdenum sulfide, it can be considered that it is not merely a constituent of the support, but also an important electronic promotor in the catalyst. The combined effect of magnesium oxide and silica gives a high alcohol yield as shown in Fig. 4c. The space-time yield of total alcohols is 150 g/goat h and that of methanol is 113 g/goat h, which is quite high. Lithium modified y-alumina (LO-y-A1203) Fig. 5 shows the effect of lithium oxide content in the MOS2/K2C03/Li20-yA1203 catalyst on the product distribution. Its mode of variation differs from that of the Mg0-Si02 system. The degree of conversion is decreasing continuously as the lithium content increases, while the methane and methanol selectivities change in the same manner as for M90-Si02. However, the methane selectivity is much higher than that of methanol. That means that on an acid support such as L2-yA1203 hydrocarbon formation is favored, while Mg0-Si02, which is basic, is good for alcohols. For the sake of getting more methanol, clearly, a support like Mg0Si02 is much better. Further discussion on promoters and supports will be presented in Part II of this paper [9] . 4.3. Effect of reaction conditions Temperature Raising the temperature always increases the reaction rate, and so does the carbon monoxide hydrogenation. However, as it is an exothermic reaction, the product distribution will be controlled both by thermodynamics and kinetics. J.

Effect of reaction temperature on product distribution, carbon monoxide conversion, and space-time yield of methanol. It is already known from thermodynamic analysis that within the specified temperature range, methane formation is practically irreversible. In the present case, the composition of the existing gas phase is far below that in its equilibrium state, so its selectivity increases with temperature. While methanol formation in this case is reversible, its equilibrium constant decreases as temperature increases. The methanol selectivity decreases slowly the lower temperature range and quickly at higher temperature. The fact that its highest space-time yield point occurs somewhere in the lower temperature range is the combined result of the higher carbon 1,214 J.

Such a phenomenon must be due to the dynamic behavior of their different transition states leading to their respective final products. The formation of the active precursor for methanol is fast, and its life is short. It will quickly transform into another species if the active species stays longer on its site. Its selectivity increases with space velocity from 800 h-' to 3000 h-', its space-time yield goes up rapidly, from 17.6 to 113 9 /lcat h. J.

Along with increasing HZ/CO ratio, the carbon monoxide conversion and methane selectivity increase continuously, but methanol selectivity decreases. This result is apparently governed by the mass action law, more hydrogen is needed for methane formation than for methanol. Thus an optimal H2/CO ratio exists for methanol formation. By combining these interrelated effects, a HZ/CO ratio of 2.16 is taken as being optimal. Sulfur content in feed gas Table 4 shows that a decrease of sulfur content results in a decrease of carbon monoxide conversion and methane selectivity, but methanol selectivity increases. Referring to the above mentioned statement, when potassium promoter is incorporated into molybdenum sulfide, alcohols are produced and a new active phase is supposed to be formed through the interaction between molybdenum disulfide and potassium carbonate. As the selectivity and space-time yield of methanol increase with low sulfur content in the feed, it can be restated that the active phase responsible for methanol is formed directly by a sulfur bridge Mo-S-K and this linkage is quite stable. Hydrogen sulfide does not participate in the formation of the new phase. On the contrary, high hydrogen sulfide content may result in occupation of some active center for methanol, but not for methane. The adsorptive sulfur species does take part in the reaction path and promotes the formation of methane. 5. Conclusions (1). A new type of sulfur tolerant methanol synthesis catalyst MOS2/KZC03/ Mg0-Si02 has been prepared and investigated. Molybdenum disulfide is the primary catalyst for carbon monoxide hydrogenation, while potassium carbonate is the important promotor interacting with molybdenum sulfide to form a new active phase responsible for methanol synthesis. The composite support Mg0-SiOZ is 1,218 J. Zhang et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (7995)1,205-1,218 good for hydrogenation of carbon monoxide as well as methanol synthesis, in which magnesium oxide plays a role to adjust the acidity and basicity of the catalyst to a proper value. (2) . The reaction conditions influence carbon monoxide conversion and the methane and methanol selectivities in different ways. As the reaction leads to a decreasing volume, raising the pressure will always shift the reaction to the right side. Increasing the temperature enhances the carbon monoxide hydrogenation rate. As regards the methane and methanol selectivities, they are always in competition in every aspect, not only in the effect of pressure and temperature, but also in space velocity and HZ/CO ratio, even in sulfur content. After considering all of these factors, using reaction conditions of 533 K, 8.1 MPa, 3000 h -t, HZ/CO=1.42 and 1350 ppm sulfur content, the highest space-time yield of methanol obtained over the new catalyst is 180 g/l,at h, which is much higher than so far found in the literature.

(+86-22) 3358329. A novel sulfur-tolerant methanol synthesis catalyst MoS2/K2CO3/MgOSiO2 has been developed and investigated. Using the information from thermodynamic analysis and the reaction path of the syngas system, a preliminary catalyst design for methanol synthesis has been put forth. A series of experiments relating to the effect of alkali and alkaline earth promoters and acid-base supports on the catalytic properties has been tested and discussed. Under the conditions of 533 K, 8.1 MPa, 3000 h−1, H2/CO= 1.42 and 1350 ppm sulfur content, the conversion of carbon monoxide is 36.1%, methanol selectivity 53.2%, space-time yield of methanol 180.3 g/lcat h, which is much higher than what is so far published in the literature.
