The biomass-based materials hold promising potential to develop high-efficiency, durable, and low-cost electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, Hemin-decorated porous offcuts of Angelica sinensis-derived carbon (H-PAC) catalyst was prepared by an activation-adsorption-pyrolysis strategy. The resultant H-PAC catalyst displays a high electrocatalytic ORR performance with positive initial potential (E onset, 0.952 V) and half-wave potential (E 1/2, 0.865 V) in alkaline medium. Additionally, this H-PAC catalyst also shows good long-term stability, with only negatively shifting 13 mV of E 1/2 after 7,500 cycles. The Zn-air battery (ZAB) assembled by H-PAC as air cathode shows a great performance of ZAB, with power density of 142.9 mW cm-2, specific capacity of 840.4 mA h g-1 at 5 mA cm-2 and 818.2 mA h g-1 at 10 mA cm-2 and charge-discharge cycling of 140 h. This study would provide a good strategy for building hierarchical-porous carbon-based catalyst from renewable biomass-waste in future study.

Zn-air battery (ZAB) has been intensively studied for its high specific capability, high energy density, outstanding safety, and economic viability. Nevertheless, the development of ZAB is seriously hindered by the intrinsic sluggish oxygen reaction kinetics on air cathode [4,5]. It is necessary to use good electrocatalysts to accelerate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Presently, the effective catalysts for improving ORR activity are Pt-based catalysts, but their high costs and limited source are bottlenecks for large-scale application [6,7]. Therefore, exploring ORR electrocatalysts with good activity, high durability and low-cost to replace noble Pt-based electrocatalyst is of great significance [8,9]. Recently, biomass‐derived porous carbon material has attracted extensive attentions as a feasible alternative to the platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts because of its rich resource, low cost and environment-friendly properties [10,11]. In addition, biomass materials rich in nitrogen and oxygen functional groups, as compared to other porous carbons, can be further prepared to form porous heteroatom-doped carbons, enhancing the electrochemical performance [10,12]. Commonly, chemical activation is employed to build porous structure and increase the surface area to provide greater accessibility to the active sites, enhancing catalytic activity [11,13]. For example, Zhao et al. utilized aubergine peels to prepare a N, S dual-doped carbon catalyst [12]. Zhang et al. prepared N and S doped porous carbon derived from rapeseed meal as ORR catalyst [13]. Angelica sinensis, which contains abundant amino acids, is a traditional Chinese medicine cultivated in many regions of China. Generally, Chinese herbal medicine is typically derived from specific parts of plants or animals, with a larger number of discarded offcuts. Therefore, offcuts of Angelica sinensis contain amino acids, making it a potential source of carbon and nitrogen [14,15]. According to previous reports, transition metal/heteroatom introduced into the carbon materials can induce electron modulation for preferable electronic density and electronic structures, effectively enhancing ORR performance [16,17]. Among them, the iron-nitrogen-carbon (Fe-N-C) catalysts have garnered increasing attention due to its superior ORR performance and durability [18,19]. The catalysts containing with Fe-Nx active sites were confirmed to have good performance for ORR [20,21]. By coincidence, Hemin exhibits well-defined Fe-N4 structure attracting widespread attention, which is a natural porphyrin and easy to obtain from animal blood [22,23]. Moreover, the pyrolysis of Hemin can facilitate the construction of active Fe-Nx sites [24]. That is to say, Hemin containing Fe-N4 structure loaded on biomass carbons to prepare catalysts, it would boost the ORR catalytic activity. In this work, Hemin-decorated porous offcuts of Angelica sinensis-derived carbon (H-PAC) was obtained by carbonization of the Angelica-waste. The morphology and the physicochemical properties of as-obtained H-PAC electrocatalyst were investigated by physical characterizations. And the catalytic activity and stability of the H-PAC electrocatalysts were measured by rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE), and further used as cathode catalyst to assemble ZAB. The study would provide a low-cost insight to develop non-PGM electrocatalysts with high-performance from renewable biomass-waste. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of H-PAC The preparation process of the H-PAC catalyst is depicted in Scheme 1 , which is divided into two steps. Herein, the offcuts of Angelica sinensis were chosen as raw biomass material. [ZnCO3]2∙[Zn(OH)2]3 was introduced as an activator. Notably, the obtained porous carbon was modified with Hemin, which contains Fe-N4 structure can make more active sites. For comparison, PAC, AC and H-C were synthesized. Preparation details are described in the supporting information. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Physical characterizations The microstructure of H-PAC was characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) firstly. As shown in Fig. 1 a, abundant pores are observed in the H-PAC from the TEM image. In the magnified TEM image, as shown in Fig. 1b, the presence of nanopores can be more clearly seen in a higher resolution. Such porous structure can increase the specific surface area, expose more active sites and facilitate the electron transportation efficiency in electrolyte [8,25]. The high angle annular dark-field (HAADF) (Fig. 1c) and elemental mapping images (Fig. 1d-f) demonstrate the compositions distributions of the H-PAC. It shows that no obvious aggregation of Fe species is observed, and the Fe, N, and C elements distributed homogenously in the whole selected area, indicating Hemin molecules uniformly loaded on porous carbon to obtain high-dispersed iron sites. The specific surface area and pore size distribution of H-PAC were revealed by N2 adsorption/desorption measurement. Fig. 2 a and Fig. S1a show that both H-PAC and PAC exhibit type IV isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops, within the 0.5–1.0 relative pressure, indicating the existence of micropores and mesopores [26]. Notably, a dramatic increase in the absorbed volume at low relative pressure(P/P0<0.05) shows that micropores exist in H-PAC [27]. Simultaneous presence of microporous and mesoporous structures would expose more accessible active sites and enhance ORR performance. Notably, the H-PAC catalyst shows a specific surface area of 1234.8 m2 g-1. It may be due to use [ZnCO3]2∙[Zn(OH)2]3 as activator, which decomposed into water, carbon dioxide and zinc oxide during the pyrolysis process, forming abundant mesopores and macropores [28]. A larger surface area not only adsorbs more Hemin molecules to generate more active sites, but also contributes to expose abundant active sites, resulting in an enhanced electrocatalytic performance [29]. The pore size distribution demonstrates that the H-PAC held a hierarchical porous structure (Fig. S1b), which is beneficial to expose more three-phase interfaces, thereby accelerating the ORR kinetics [30]. The architecture hierarchically porous characteristics give the H-PAC more accessible active sites and accelerating mass/electron transportation process in ORR. Specifically, mesopores and macropores are beneficial for the adsorption of O2 molecule, creating more defective sites, and promoting mass transfer efficiency for accelerating the ORR rate [31,32]. The crystalline structure characteristics of all samples were analyzed by the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. As shown in Fig. 2b, the XRD patterns of all samples show broad diffraction peaks around 24.1°, attributing to the (002) plane of graphitic carbon [33]. Noteworthily, the XRD pattern of H-PAC catalyst detects no diffraction peak of iron composites, implying the iron species might be uniform distribution in sample or be the presence of amorphous state. Compared with the pattern of PAC, the (101) plane peak gradually becomes weaker and the (002) diffraction peak becomes wider, indicating the higher degree of defects [30,34]. While, the catalyst shows a set of peaks at 43.8°, 44.7°, and 47.7°, which are assigned to the iron carbide [33,35]. And the AC reference has a sharp peak centered at 26.5°, demonstrating that certain graphitic domains existed in amorphous carbon [32]. Raman was used to study the crystal structures of carbon in obtained samples, as show in Fig. 2c, it displays two peaks at 1320 and 1592 cm-1, ascribing to defect sites (D band) and graphitic sp2 carbon (G band) in the carbon material, respectively [36,37]. The specific value of intensity of D band and G band (I D/I G) can assess the graphite material defect density, and a higher value implies a more degree of defects [12]. The values of I D/I G for AC, PAC, and H-PAC are 1.10, 1.11 and 1.11 accordingly, indicating the defect structure increases and simultaneous forming a certain amount of graphite during the activation process [38]. Obviously, all I D/I G values of these samples are over 1.00, indicating all catalysts have high degree of defects. Generally, the high defects degree in the carbon material is favorable for exposing active sites, which can accelerate O2 adsorption in ORR [20]. Noteworthily, the level of graphitization was unchanged after incorporation of Hemin into porous carbon. [35,38]. The composition and binding energy of catalysts were further determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The full XPS spectra of the as-prepared electrocatalysts show pronounced C 1 s at 284.6 eV and O 1 s peaks at 534.4 eV, respectively, as well as weak N 1 s peaks at 400.4 eV (Fig. S2) [34]. Notably, XPS survey spectra of H-C and H-PAC show the presence of Fe element, which indicates that Hemin was successfully incorporated to the carbon frameworks. In addition, the EDS elemental-mapping images (Fig. 1d-f) of H-PAC also testify the uniform distribution of C, N, and Fe elements throughout the entire carbon structure. The XPS C 1 s spectrum of H-PAC was deconvoluted into 283.4 eV (carbide), 284.6 eV (C–C), 286.1 eV (C = N) and 286.7 eV (C = O) (Fig. 2d) [13,35]. The C = O bond confirm the presence of oxygen-containing groups on the carbon matrix, which may lead to defects in the material [27]. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 2e, the N 1 s spectrum of H-PAC exhibits four peaks at 400.1, 399.4, 398.4, and 397.5 eV, which are ascribed to graphitic N, Fe-Nx bonding, pyridinic N and CN, respectively [35,38]. Meanwhile, the C 1 s XPS spectrum of PAC is divided into carbide (283.3 eV), C–C (284.6 eV), C–O (286.4 eV) and C–N (288.5 eV) (Fig. S3a) [13,35]. And the N 1 s spectrum is classified into pyrrolic N (400.0 eV), graphitic N (400.7 eV), and oxidized N (401.5 eV), respectively (Fig. S3b) [35]. Compared to PAC, the peak of graphitic N shifted from 400.7 eV to 400.1 eV. Additionally, the type and content of nitrogen species also changed, resulting in the formation of pyridinic N and Fe-Nx, which can provide more active sites and modulate the electronic configuration of adjacent carbon atoms. Generally, pyridinic N and graphitic N are regarded as active sites. Individually, pyridine N is favorable to improve the E onset and increase the four-electron transfer process, and graphitic N increases the limited current density (j L) for ORR. Both graphitic and pyridinic N facilitate adsorbing and activating oxygen molecules by altering the electronic structure of adjacent C atom [13,39]. The high-resolution Fe 2p spectrum is shown in Fig. 2f. The peaks at 711.6 and 723.8 eV belong to the Fe2p3/2 and Fe2p1/2 species, are derived from Fe-Nx bonds [29]. And the Fe-Nx as the effective active site could enhance the surface adsorption of reaction intermediate species on carbon skeleton and optimize the binding strengths between catalyst and reactant, favorably enhancing the activity of ORR [21,22]. 3.2 Electrochemical characterizations The electrocatalytic performance of catalysts was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the H-PAC presents the highest half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.865 V, which is higher than that of the commercial Pt/C (0.847 V), H-C (0.770 V) and PAC (0.810 V). Notably, the j L of H-PAC is the lowest (j L = −4.6 mA cm-2). Obviously, the introduction of more porous and Hemin can effectively improve the ORR performance in terms of E 1/2, E onset and j L. The good result is attributed to the hierarchically porous structure, graphitic N, pyridinic N and increased Fe-Nx active sites. A high surface area of H-PAC can promote the charge-transfer process, accelerate the electron delivery rate and increase exposed accessible active sites of ORR. Additionally, the more active sites and the faster mass transfer enable to further reduce the energy barrier of ORR reaction [29,31]. Furthermore, as the Tafel slope is related to the ORR kinetics, the corresponding results of H-PAC and Pt/C are showed in Fig. 3b, where H-PAC catalyst displays the lowest slope (50.7 mV dec-1), suggesting faster ORR kinetics. The long-term operational stability is essential criterion to evaluate catalyst. Thence, the durability and stability of the catalysts were evaluated by accelerated aging tests (AAT) and current-time (i-t) chronoamperometric measurements [29]. In Fig. 3c, the E 1/2 value of H-PAC only negatively shifts 13 mV after undergoing 7500 cycles, but the E 1/2 value of Pt/C negatively shifts 26 mV (Fig. S4). The i-t chronoamperometric measurement also shows the similar results as shown in Fig. 3d. The H-PAC retains 91.1 % of current density after 50,000 s, however, the Pt/C retains 64.9 % of initial current density. The result clearly demonstrates that the H-PAC has good stability, which is due to the space confinement effect of hierarchically porous structure, preventing the aggregation of Fe species [20]. To further study the reaction kinetics of H-PAC during electrochemical process, the LSV curves of H-PAC were used to measure Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots and the electron transfer number (n) from 400 to 2500 rpm. In Fig. 3e, clearly, with the rise of rotation speeds, the j L of H-PAC gradually increased, demonstrating a kinetically controlled process on H-PAC [39]. The K-L diagrams obtained from LSV curves were plotted in Fig. 3f which exhibits good linearity and a similar parallel relationship. The calculated n is about 4 on H-PAC, demonstrating that the H-PAC favors a four-electron process on ORR. To be applied in ZAB, the OER (oxygen evolution reaction) performance was also tested (Fig. S5). Compared to Pt/C with an overpotential is 810 mV at 10 mA cm-2, the H-PAC shows the OER activity with an overpotential of 540 mV and the lowest Tafel slope (34.6 mV dec-1), indicating that its OER performance is also acceptable. 3.3 Performance of assembled ZAB To evaluate the practical applications in ZAB, homemade ZAB was assembled to evaluate the practical applicability. The performance of H-PAC was evaluated and compared with the benchmark of 20 wt% Pt/C in ZAB. In Fig. 4 a, the ZAB containing H-PAC exhibits open-circuit voltage of 1.451 V. The corresponding power density curves and polarization curves are displayed in Fig. 4b and Fig. 4c. Evidently, the power density of 20 wt% Pt/C (119.6 mW cm-2) is lower than that of H-PAC (142.9 mW cm-2). Additionally, the H-PAC exhibits a narrower charge/discharge voltage gap compared to Pt/C, demonstrating superior charge/discharge capacity [40]. The mass of Zn consumed is normalized at the discharge current densities of 5 mA cm-2 and 10 mA cm-2, as shown in Fig. 4d, the H-PAC generates a specific energy capacity of 840.4 mA h g-1 and 818.2 mA h g-1, accordingly. Additionally, when the current density recovered from 50 mA cm-2 to 5 mA cm-2, as shown in Fig. 4e, the discharge recovered also can be well recovered, indicating the good rate performance [29]. The stability of assembled ZAB was further assessed by a long-term charge-discharge cycle experiment at 5 mA cm-2, as shown in Fig. 4f, which exhibits stable performance as long as 140 h. In sum, the H-PAC exhibits effective catalytic performance for ORR and shows great potential in the application of ZAB. According to the above results, the reasons for the H-PAC has good ORR activity as air-cathode electrocatalyst for ZAB can be summarized as follows: i) H-PAC contains rich active sites of pyridinic N, graphitic N and Fe-Nx, which can enhance the chemical adsorption of *OOH and *O₂ intermediates, promoting charge exchange between the catalyst surface and the intermediates. Namely, the more active sites are introduced, the better promoting of the adsorption of oxygen intermediates for high-efficiency ORR electrocatalysis [41,42]. ii) The prepared H-PAC possesses high BET surface area (1234.8 m2 g-1) and three-dimensional hierarchically porous structure, exposing more catalytic active sites and accelerate mass/charge diffusion. iii) The incorporated N and Fe form Fe-Nx active center, which can lower the energy of the ORR reaction pathway, enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of ORR [43–45]. iv) The defects and graphitic N can optimize the local electronic redistribution of active sites, favoring a lower free-energy barrier for ORR reaction [39,46]. 4 Conclusion In summary, the H-PAC electrocatalyst was prepared by an activation-adsorption-pyrolysis strategy. It shows that the as-prepared H-PAC possesses a high BET surface area (1234.8 m2 g-1) with hierarchically porous structure under Fe/N atoms doping. Importantly, the H-PAC electrocatalyst displays an E 1/2 value of 0.865 V, which surpasses commercial Pt/C catalyst. Additionally, the assembled rechargeable H-PAC based ZAB displays high stability and durability, with higher power density than Pt/C and better cyclic charge/discharge performance at high current density. This work would propose a promising approach to design and prepare efficient ORR catalysts from renewable biomass-waste in the future.

        "dc:description": "The biomass-based materials hold promising potential to develop high-efficiency, durable, and low-cost electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, Hemin-decorated porous offcuts of Angelica sinensis-derived carbon (H-PAC) catalyst was prepared by an activation-adsorption-pyrolysis strategy. The resultant H-PAC catalyst displays a high electrocatalytic ORR performance with positive initial potential (E onset, 0.952 V) and half-wave potential (E 1/2, 0.865 V) in alkaline medium. Additionally, this H-PAC catalyst also shows good long-term stability, with only negatively shifting 13 mV of E 1/2 after 7,500 cycles. The Zn-air battery (ZAB) assembled by H-PAC as air cathode shows a great performance of ZAB, with power density of 142.9 mW cm-2, specific capacity of 840.4 mA h g-1 at 5 mA cm-2 and 818.2 mA h g-1 at 10 mA cm-2 and charge-discharge cycling of 140 h. This study would provide a good strategy for building hierarchical-porous carbon-based catalyst from renewable biomass-waste in future study.",
