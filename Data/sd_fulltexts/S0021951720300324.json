Graphical abstract Co encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanotubes (Co-NCNT) catalysts are of high interest as bifunctional electrocatalyst material for both efficient oxygen evolution and reduction (OER/ORR) in applications of rechargeable metal-air batteries. Up to now, the role played by the functional metal species in OER/ORR is still insufficiently understood. The main focus of our research is to shed light on the mechanistic role of the Co species that serve as active sites in the bi-functional Co-NCNT catalysts. It is found that S700 exhibits an outstanding OER/ORR activity. We thus hypothesize that CoII and CoIII clusters predominately function as active sites in the OER and ORR processes, respectively. Furthermore, OER/ORR activity for Co-NCNT catalyst primarily correlates to eg occupation. A near-unity occupancy of the eg orbital of S700 is revealed to be the cause for the maximum intrinsic OER/ORR activity, which provides guidelines for the design of highly active catalysts.

Development of clean and sustainable energy storage and conversion systems has gained global attention [1,2]. Metal-air batteries and fuel cells have long been recognized as the next generation energy storage device due to their unique features, including low cost, environmentally benign and high safety [3–5]. Two processes of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for charging and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for discharging play vital roles in the oxygen electrode, which may determine the final battery performance due to the sluggish kinetics. Therefore, efficient electrocatalysts are developed as “bifunctional” catalysts to low the energy barrier and expedite the reaction efficiency. The avoidance of rare chemical elements, specifically noble metals [6,7] promotes the development of non-noble metal based and even metal-free electrocatalysts highly desirable for their practical applications [8–11]. Recent efforts have been devoted to developing transition-metal-based materials as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for both ORR and OER. As reported in a series of studies, transition metal cobalt (Co) encapsulated in N-doped carbon matrix (Co-NC) as low-cost alternatives were found to exhibit appealing catalytic activity for the ORR/OER, which attracted enormous interest [12–14]. It is reported that the Co-NC electrocatalysts showing superior bifunctional catalysis in ORR/OER can be ascribed to three reasons: (I) Synergistic catalytic effects of the Co nanoparticles and the N dopants are responsible for improving the catalytic activity [15]. (II) Host-guest electronic interaction can contribute to the formation of catalytic functionalities, which further provide more active sites for the ORR and OER [16]. (III) Supported on carbon can reduce the electric resistance of catalysts and maintain a good durability by hosting the active sites. Although massive research on bi-functional Co-NC electrocatalysts has summarized the achievements in revealing mechanism of OER/ORR processes, controversy in determining the active sites for OER/ORR performance still exist. Some researchers believe that the metal functions as active part of the catalytic site electrochemically [17,18], while the others argue that Co-N/C active sites played a major role in OER/ORR catalysis, highlighting the importance of N in OER/ORR processes for Co-N-C catalysts [19]. It is revealed that carbon matrix doped with nitrogen or other non-metallic could lead to a stronger O2 binding energy at cobalt centers and improve their ORR activity [20]. Herein, we introduce three Co encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanotubes (Co-NCNT) catalysts with increasing crystallinity prepared in various temperatures (700 °C, 800 °C, 900 °C). It was found that no significant changes in N 1s spectra (Fig. S9) was detected for series Co-NCNT catalysts, but a distinguished difference can be observed in OER and ORR activity for these three samples. Therefore, apart from the role of N doped C serving as active sites, it is essential to shed light on the effect and intrinsic mechanism of Co species in influencing the bi-functional reactions. Co-NCNT samples consist of Co in three oxidation states, namely Co0, CoII and CoIII in different ratios without the formation of Co-N species, which distinguishes from the above research work. We provide new insight into the Co centers functioned in ORR&OER by combining quasi-in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and electrochemical characterization. Moreover, for oxide catalysts possessing octahedral structures, the octahedral crystal field further splits the t2g multiplet and two doubly degenerate eg orbitals. Shao-Horn and co-workers firstly propose the primary descriptor that governs the OER/ORR activity is supposed to be the eg occupancy [21,22]. Since the eg orbital is involved in the formation and filling of σ-bonding with a surface-anion adsorbate for OER and a σ* anti-bonding with a molecular orbital of surface oxygen for ORR [21,22], thus its occupancy can greatly govern the intrinsic OER/ORR activity by tuning the binding of intermediate species on transition metal ions sites. Some attempts focused on delicate regulating of spin states have been performed to boost the catalytic activities by means of adjusting the oxidation states of transition metal ions via partial substitution or oxygen deficiency [23–26]. It is noteworthy that engineering the crystallinity of transition metal ions is another effective way to modify their spin structures. The degree of the crystallinity greatly determines the extent of lattice distortion, which in turn causes the change in coordination of transition metal ions as well as the regularity of crystal fields, thus may affect the spin states and eg occupancy. We take advantage of the flexibility of the valence states changing by tuning crystallinity of Co-based catalyst to establish a simple correlation between catalytic activity of Co-NCNT catalysts and the occupancy of the eg orbital of surface Co metal ions. Additionally, we also track the change of chemical components and local structure of catalysts and the relevant redox states of the metal centers observed during catalysis by XAS measurements, further identifying the dominant active Co species that govern the intrinsic OER/ORR activity. Insights and concepts described herein for the Co-NCNT system may be of relevance for knowledge-guided improvement of other catalysts based on transition metal encapsulated in carbon structures. 2 Results and discussion The synthetic process of the heteroatom doped CNTs is illustrated in Fig. 1 . Initially, carbon nitride was synthesized by thermal condensation of urea at 550 °C. The subsequent pyrolysis of the mixture of carbon nitride and PVP in the presence of cobalt salts rendered the formation of carbon nanotubes with heteroatom doping. 2.1 Physical characterization The XRD pattern (Fig. 2 a) reveals the presence of metallic cobalt, which would be benefit to the formation of graphitic carbon nanotubes at a low temperature due to the catalytic effect of cobalt [27]. Besides, all the samples exhibit the identical peaks, corresponding to the typical X-ray reflections of graphite-2H and fcc metallic cobalt. Specifically, the peak at about 26.1° corresponds to the (0 0 2) plane of graphitic carbon. The peaks at about 44.5°, 51.8° and 76.1° are ascribed to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) planes of metallic cobalt. The degree of graphitization of S700 is higher than that of S800 and S900. The SEM images in Fig. 2(b, c, d) show the fiber-like structure of the samples S700-S900, which are distributed in different orientation. The TEM images reveal the bamboo-like nature with hollow inner channels. The morphology of the samples shows that large amounts of metal nanoparticles (located not only in the tube tips but also in the tube body) are encapsulated by CNTs, which are composed by multiple layers of carbon shells. Cobalt nanoparticles located in the CNT tips observed from HRTEM indicate the result of Co catalyzed growth of CNTs. According to the HRTEM image (Fig. 2e), S700 fails to present obvious lattice fringes, illustrating the poor crystallinity of metallic cobalt in S700. The crystallinity of metallic cobalt is higher in samples S800 and S900: the HRTEM images of S800 (Fig. 2f) and S900 (Fig. 2g) show that cobalt particles are organized in single crystals with an interplanar distance of 0.204 nm, corresponding to the (1 1 1) plane of the metallic cobalt. 2.2 Electrochemical characterization The direct electron transfer mechanism can be determined using the charge/mass balance by the RRDE technique [28,29]. The electron number (n) is quantitatively calculated to be about 3.86, 3.91 and 3.89 for S700, S800 and S900 at 0.3–0.6 V based on RRDE voltammograms in Fig. 3 a, indicating the reduction of oxygen to water via a favorable four-electron pathway, which is comparable to the 3.84 of the commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst. In addition, the hydrogen peroxide yield (% H2O2) for all samples during the ORR is found below 10% over the potential range of 0.3 V to 0.6 V (Fig. 3b), further indicating a pseudo four electron transfer reaction pathway. For comparison, electron transfer processes under complete diffusion-controlled conditions are also given in Fig. S4. The number of electrons determined from Koutecky-Levich plots are close to the values obtained by RRDE analysis except the Pt/C, which yields a value of 4.1 (this is not reliable since the Koutecky-Levich equation is not fully applicable to Pt/C because the currents in the 0 to 0.6 V vs. RHE range are not stable under different electrode rotation rates). Fig. 3a shows a set of LSV curves obtained in an RRDE configuration in O2-saturated KOH electrolyte at an electrode rotation rate of 1600 rpm, which exhibit a well-defined charge-transfer kinetic control, mixed kinetic-diffusion, and diffusion-limited currents. In order to further explore the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of these catalysts, the ik -V (ik means the kinetic current density) curves are obtained by converting the current densities (Fig. 3a) into kinetic currents (Fig. 3c) at voltage range of 0.8–1.0 V vs. RHE according to the Koutecky-Levich equation [30], In this voltage region, the system is under complete kinetic control. Associative mechanism of ORR under alkaline conditions can be expressed as the following elementary steps [31,32]: (1) M + O2 ⇌ MO2 (2) MO2 + e − ⇌ MO2 − (3) MO2 − + H2O ⇌ MO2H + OH− (4) MO2H + e − ⇌ MO + OH− The obtained Tafel slopes in the linear E-logi regions are reasonably close to the value of 60 ± 5 mV dec−1. Previous works reported some other Co-N-C based materials exhibiting comparable ORR Tafel slopes with the ones in our work (65 mV dec−1 for CoNxCy moiety [20], 66 mV dec−1 for Co-Nx/C NRA [33], 61 mV dec−1 for Co/N-C-800 [14]). The Tafel slope of 60 mV dec−1 indicates the rate determining step in ORR is Eq. (3), which is not an electron transfer reaction. Therefore, the reaction rate mainly originates from that of the coverage of the adsorbed species [34]. S700 with the lowest Tafel slope is the most active sample since it requires the lowest additional voltage to reach an operating catalytic current. In catalysis, an effective figure of merit to compare the intrinsic activities of different catalyst materials is the turn over frequency (TOF) [35]. Intrinsic activity measurements by per-site TOF (Fig. 3d) also provide the evidence that S700 presents the highest ORR activity on a per-site basis, which is consistent with the Tafel results. Based on RRDE and RDE measurements, S800 exhibits an electron number closest to 4 (pseudo four electron transfer reaction pathway) of all investigated samples in the ORR process, while S700 has the highest intrinsic activity in the kinetic-control region. This will be discussed in the last section in detail. The OER performance of the CNT-Co samples is shown in Fig. 3e and f. To eliminate the catalyst loading effect from the intrinsic OER catalytic activity, we analyze the mass-normalized kinetic current density (in the following referred to as specific activity) as a function of voltage versus RHE. The results consistently demonstrate that S700 yields the highest specific OER activity among all three catalysts, based on overpotential (at the current density of 10 mA cm−2), Tafel slope as well as per-site TOF. 3 Correlation of the electrochemical performance and the oxidation state of the sample The influence of sintering temperature on the electrochemical properties was characterized by XAS to uncover the change of oxidation states and the transformation of local atomic structure motifs at the Co K-edges when operated at 1.564 V vs. RHE and −0.236 V vs. RHE in KOH solution, as shown in Fig. 4 . XANES reference spectra of Co0 (Co metal foil), CoII and CoIII are shown in Fig. 4a. Our hypothesis based on the crystalline difference of Co-CNT at diverse temperatures is that our Co-CNT samples consist of Co in three oxidation states, namely Co0, CoII and CoIII in different ratios. This result is consist with the argument from Yeager and coworkers, who proposed that metal-N4 (e.g. Co-N4) macrocycles may be generated during pyrolysis, but start to decompose at about 400–500 °C. At higher pyrolysis temperatures, most of the metal can be spontaneously oxidized when exposed to air at room temperature, leaving a mixture of oxides and metal in Co-NCNT catalysts [36,37]. To test this presumption, we calculated linear combinations of S700, S800 and S900. The percentage of the three species in each sample is optimized by linear combination of the Co foil, CoII and CoIII reference spectra. It can be seen in Fig. 4b that the proportion of Co0 increases with the calcination temperature of the sample, while CoII and CoIII decrease with the calcination temperature. The outcome can be explained as follows: the generated reducing gas (carbon) during the pyrolysis process facilitates the transformation from metal ions/clusters into metal nanocatalysts (Co0) at higher temperature calcination. This is in line with the TEM results (Fig. 2). After the application of a negative potential, Co species with high oxidation states are reduced into a metallic structure, giving rise to the increase of Co0%. However, applying a positive potential still creates an enhancement of Co0%. Although part of Co species with low oxidation state (0 or II) get oxidized, the as-formed or original CoII or CoIII are dissolved in KOH electrolyte during operation at high voltage (evidenced by TXRF). Therefore, all the catalysts show an increase of Co0% under both −0.236 V and 1.564 V (vs. RHE) operation. It is noticed that the percentage loss of Co decreases with increasing of annealing temperature, which means that the high volume fractions of Co species with higher oxidation state (CoII or CoIII) other than metallic Co are more likely to dissolve. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that S800 loses 23.6% of Co after operation at 1.564 V (vs. RHE), a quantity being much higher than that of the other samples, thus pulling down the fraction of CoII and CoIII under 1.564 V (vs. RHE) operation. So it is understandable that the fraction of Co with high oxidation state decreases other than increases even though Co catalyst is oxidized at 1.564 V (vs. RHE). Furthermore, Co oxidation states are also calculated to understand the ability in cobalt oxidation states changing during electrochemical conditioning (Fig. 4d). We observe that the average oxidation state for the examined samples S700, S800 and S900 equates to 1.60, 0.94 and 0.54, respectively. It is concluded that the higher the annealing temperature, the closer to zero the valence. These results can be explained by the formation process of Co-NCNT catalyst. The metal ions/clusters are firstly reduced into Co nanocatalysts by reducing gas generated during the pyrolysis process, and these nanocatalysts function as catalyst to further turn the residual organic units into N-CNTs with Co nanoparticles inside of them. In brief, high calcination temperature facilitates the reduction process to form the metallic Co metal more thoroughly. After conditioning at −0.236 V (vs. RHE) in KOH, all the Co species in S700, S800 and S900 get reduced which corresponds to the decreased oxidation state to 0.91, 0.25 and 0.35, respectively. Because of the observable loss of Co during operation at 1.564 V (vs. RHE), the oxidation states of S700 and S800 are exhibiting decline other than enhancement after 1.564 V (vs. RHE) operation, and the drop of oxidation states is more pronounced in S800 due to the significant fraction of Co loss of 23.6%. In addition, only S900 shows an increase of oxidation state (0.59) after 1.564 V (vs. RHE) operation on account of the negligible loss of Co. To determine the local atomic structure of the Co ions in Co-NCNT catalysts under electrochemical reaction conditions, the Fourier transform (FT) spectra of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) Co K-edge spectra are recorded on S700, S800 and S900 along with the Co references spectra (Fig. 5 ). The corresponding EXAFS k3χ data are shown in Fig. S10. Fourier transforms of the EXAFS spectra (Fig. 5a) of S700, S800 and S900 show local structure similar to that of metallic Co in a fcc crystal lattice. There are noticeable reductions in the magnitude of EXAFS oscillation for these three samples in comparison with the theoretical EXAFS pattern for Co metal foil, revealing that the average number of Co neighbors in the consecutive coordination shells in these samples is lower than in the Co foil. In other words, the lack of a long range ordering Co-NCNT catalysts signifies sizeable non-metallic contribution with the presence of light atoms (O) in the first Co coordination sphere. Distances fitted from the Co EXAFS show that the Co catalyst could be well matched by O coordinated at 1.98 Å, mono-µ-oxo-bridged CoII ions at 3.07 Å, di-µ-O(H)-bridged CoIII octahedral at 2.85 Å (Table S2 and Fig. 5). The spectral feature centered at ~2.49 Å is assigned to backscattering from Co atoms and corresponds to the CoCo bond distances and is the same as reference Co foil. The peak intensity increases, as a result of higher order in the CoCo coordination sphere, after operation at 1.564 V and −0.236 V (vs. RHE). Fig. 5b shows the relative changes in the atomic distances as well as coordination numbers (CN) assignable to CoO bridges at selected catalyst states. For CoII, the average bond length is 1.960 Å (4-coordinated), and for octahedral CoIII compounds, the average bond length is 1.895 Å [38]. The first inter-atomic CoO peak is detectable in all as-pre Co-films. The CoO bond lengths in S800 and S900 are between 1.895 Å and 1.960 Å, which indicate the coexistence of CoII and CoIII. These two catalysts after operation at 1.564 V and −0.236 V (vs. RHE) exhibit shorter CoO bond lengths compared with the one in as-pre Co-NCNT, which corroborates the prevalence of CoIII in the operated samples. Possible explanation is that upon operation at positive potential, CoII can be oxidized into CoIII, while operation at negative potential can result in the transformation from CoIII to CoII, but the significant dissolution of CoII makes the CoIII species still be the dominant oxide in Co-CNT. The CN change in S800 and S900 also confirms the verdict above. There are two distinct CoO bond lengths in S700, in which the bond lengths of 1.916 Å and 2.140 Å can be ascribed to CoIII and CoII species. After applied positive potential (1.564 V), it can be observed an increase in CN for CoIII and a decrease for CoII due to oxidation of Co species. CoO distance in CoII is stretched about 0.05 Å longer than that of as-pre S700, indicating that some CoII species originate from the oxidation of Co0. Note that the loss of CoII which are converted into CoIII surpasses the formation of CoII (oxidized from Co0), contributing to the CN drop of CoII. The compressed CoO distance in CoIII hints the possibility of further oxidation of as-formed CoIII in as-pre S700. After applied negative potential (−0.236 V), the change of CN for CoII and CoIII is the exact opposite of that in positive condition, implying the reduction from CoIII to CoII. No distinct variation (within measuring error ranges) in CoO distance for both CoII and CoIII can be distinguished before and after −0.236 V operation. These observations are consistent with the evolution of the Co oxidation state reported in Fig. 4b. For insight into the correlation between ORR&OER activity and local atomic structure as well as oxidation state of the Co ions in Co-based catalysts, it is necessary to compare the percentage of Co species (Co0, CoII and CoIII) in these three samples. As shown in Fig. 6 a, S900 possesses the highest volume fractions of Co0 and lowest CoIII, while S700 is just the opposite. It is noted that all the Co species for S800 are at a middle level in content. This observation further confirmes that a high-temperature annealing process would facilitate the generation of lower valence Co species. In order to identify the dominating contribution from Co species in ORR and OER processes, the content changes of Co species after operation at −0.236 V and 1.564 V (vs. RHE) are summarized in Fig. 6b. It is noticed that there is no significant difference in the fractions of CoIII in these three samples after −0.236 V (vs. RHE) operation. However, 25.8%, 9.4% and 0.4% reduction in CoIII percentage can be observed in S700, S800 and S900, which indicates that S700 possesses the highest reduction capability, followed by S800 and then S900. In brief, CoIII ions may play a predominate role in ORR process. It is also true that CoII shows comparable content after operation at 1.564 V (vs. RHE), while 30.6%, 23.7% and 14.3% decrease in CoII fractions could be obtained after operation. Similar with the finding in ORR process, the oxidation capability also follow the same order in OER process: S700 > S800 > S900. It is suggested that CoII would be responsible for determining OER reaction rate. Based on the predications above, S700 should exhibit the highest ORR as well as OER performance. Interestingly, it is well consistent with the experimental results in Fig. 3. In principle, the OER/ORR intrinsic activities correlate to the eg occupancy of the 3d electron in transition metal oxide with octahedral crystal field. It is known that transitional metal ions with various valence states will exhibit different spin states and eg configuration because of their different coordination environments [23]. Therefore, the eg occupancy of Co species in S700, S800 and S900 might change with the oxide crystallinity resulted from the synthesizing temperatures. Consequently, the total effective magnetic moments (µ eff, Co) filling for Co species in all Co samples could be derived from magnetic hysteresis loop (Fig. 6c, see the Supporting Information for detailed calculations). Accordingly, eg occupancy for Co species is calculated to be 0.714 for S700, 0.516 for S800 and 0.354 for S900. According to OER/ORR activity design principle proposed by Shao-Horn [21,39], a near-unity occupancy of the eg orbital of surface transition metal ions is predicted to possess the highest intrinsic OER/ORR activity. Since the eg occupancy of S700 is the closest to unity, it can be regarded as the cause for the highest OER and ORR intrinsic activity catalyst. Co-based catalysts in practical application as the air cathode in a homemade rechargeable Zn-air battery are evaluated (Fig. S12, Supporting Information). S700 catalyst in the battery can provide the highest open-circuit voltage, exhibiting ideally suited for such primary Zn-air batteries due to the superior ORR activity and durability. It is also noted that 800 yields the highest electron transfer numbers value (3.91) among all catalysts in ORR processes by the RRDE and RDE measurement (Fig. 3, S4). ORR catalysts with four-electron pathway not only depend on the facilitating active sites, but also are determined by mass transfer efficiency. Since ORR process is kinetic-controlled in the ohmic polarization region and diffusion-controlled in the mass transport polarization region, mass transport in the electrodes plays more dominated role in ORR than OER. The supply of reactant on electrode (i. e. Dissolved Oxygen in the electrolyte) can significantly influence the electron transfer number in ORR. The uniform pore size of S800 in Fig. S3 might facilitate the mass transport in oxygen reduction, which is a possible reason explaining why S800 shows the highest electron transfer number in ORR among these three samples. These results thus shed light onto the roles of Co0, CoII and CoIII in high-activity Co-NCNT catalysts and provide further knowledge-guided basis for the optimization of catalyst performance. 4 Conclusion In this work, nitrogen-doped nanostructured carbon-based catalysts, Co-NCNT, are synthesized at various temperatures of 700 °C, 800 °C and 900 °C by annealing C3N4 and K3[Co(CN)6] as nitrogen and cobalt precursors. The as-prepared catalysts (S700, S800 and S900) exhibit outstanding ORR as well as OER activities. The S700 catalyst exhibits the largest limiting current density approaching to that of commercial Pt/C in an alkaline medium. In addition, S700 also displays a higher activity toward OER, demonstrating excellent overall bi-catalytic performance. After successful testing of the catalysts in an alkaline condition, these materials have been shown to be a promising air catalysts in rechargeable zinc-air batteries (Fig. S12). Based on the chemical components, relevant oxidation-state characteristics and structural changes of Co-NCNT catalysts, the influence of sintering temperature on the electrochemical properties is illustrated in detail. (1) All the three Co-based catalysts (S700, S800 and S900) structurally consist of three components with various mass fractions, Co0, CoII and CoIII. A higher temperature annealing process will give rise to a more completed reduction of Co precursor to evolve more metallic Co species. (2) Various Co components (Co0, CoII and CoIII) present different reduction and oxidation capability, in particular CoIII species are predominately associated with the ORR process, while CoII species are presumably responsible for the oxygen evolution. A superior electrocatalytic ORR and OER activity of S700 arises from more active sites provided by disordered CoIII and CoII clusters. (3) The calcination temperature affects the catalyst crystallinity and the percentage of the different Co components, thus contributes to tunable eg filling of Co-based catalysts. The intrinsic OER/ORR activity of Co-NCNT catalysts in present work correlates to the occupancy of the eg orbital of surface Co metal ions. S700 with eg occupation of 0.714 (close to unity) exhibits outstanding bifunctional OER/ORR activities and serves as a promising air cathode in a homemade Zn-air battery.

        "dc:description": "Co encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanotubes (Co-NCNT) catalysts are of high interest as bifunctional electrocatalyst material for both efficient oxygen evolution and reduction (OER/ORR) in applications of rechargeable metal-air batteries. Up to now, the role played by the functional metal species in OER/ORR is still insufficiently understood. The main focus of our research is to shed light on the mechanistic role of the Co species that serve as active sites in the bi-functional Co-NCNT catalysts. It is found that S700 exhibits an outstanding OER/ORR activity. We thus hypothesize that CoII and CoIII clusters predominately function as active sites in the OER and ORR processes, respectively. Furthermore, OER/ORR activity for Co-NCNT catalyst primarily correlates to eg occupation. A near-unity occupancy of the eg orbital of S700 is revealed to be the cause for the maximum intrinsic OER/ORR activity, which provides guidelines for the design of highly active catalysts.",
