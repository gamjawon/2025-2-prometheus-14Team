Introduction It is well documented that a tartaric acid-sodium bromide-modified Raney nickel (TA-NaBr-MRNi) catalyst gives high optical yields for the hydrogenation of acetoacetates and 2-alkanones [ 1 ] . Optical yields over this catalyst are controlled by a number of catalyst-preparation variables and reaction variables [ 2 ] . We reported that the addition of carboxylic acid to the reaction system drastically * Corresponding author. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDI0304-5102(94)00090-1 212 T. Haraaa et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 211-219 improved optical yields for the hydrogenation of 2-alkanones [ 3-5 ] . The resultant optical yield was dependent on the structure and the amount of acid. Monocarboxylic acids carrying a-branched alkyl groups, such as isobutyric acid and pivalic acid, gave high optical yields for the hydrogenation of 2-alkanones when they were added in excess to the substrate. Recently, we proposed the stereochemical mode of enantioface-differentiation of 2-alkanone [ 6 ] . As for the enantioface-differentiating hydrogenation of acetoacetates over TA-NaBr-MRNi, a small amount of acetic acid was contained in the reaction system under the conditions giving optical yields higher than 80% [ 7,8 ] . However, the effects of carboxylic acids in the reaction system on the optical yields have not been systematically investigated for the hydrogenation of 8-ketoesters. In this paper, the results of enantioface-differentiating hydrogenation of 2-octanone and methyl acetoacetate (MAA) over TANaBr-MRNi in the presence of various carboxylic acids are presented. Also, the adsorption species on TA-NaBr-MRNi, which differentiate the enantiofaces of the substrates to give the optically active products are proposed. 2. Experimental The GLC analyses of the products were carried out using a Shimadzu GC-15A gas chromatograph. The optical rotations of the products were measured using a Perkin Elmer 241 polarimeter. The materials in this study were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. 2.1. Raney nickel (RNi) catalyst Two kinds of RNi catalysts were used in this study. (1) The RNi alloy (Ni/Al=42/58, 3.8 g) was added in small amounts to 40 ml of a 20% aqueous solution of NaOH. The mixture was then allowed to stand at 100 C for 1 h. After the subsequent removal of the alkaline solution by decantation, the catalyst was washed 15 times with 30-ml portions of deionized water. The obtained catalyst was then used in the preparation of TA-NaBr-MRNi for the hydrogenation of 2-octanone. (2) The RNi catalyst was prepared from 1.0 g (or 3.0 g) of the alloy by the above procedure with a small modification. The amount of the aqueous NaOH solution was 10 ml (30 ml), and the catalyst was washed 15 times with 10-ml (30ml) portions of deionized water. The RNi catalyst and 20 ml (60 ml) of deionized water in a flask were subjected to ultrasonication using an ultrasound generator (Sono Cleaner 200a, Kaijodenki Co., Ltd.) at 38 kHz for 5 min [ 9 ] . The resulting supernatant was removed by decantation from the catalyst. The catalyst was then treated with ultrasounds once more. This procedure was used in the preparation of TA-NaBr-MRNi for the hydrogenation of MAA. T. HaraO et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 211-219 213 2.2. Modification of the catalyst (1) Hydrogenation of 2-octanone. The RNi catalyst was soaked in 200 ml of an aqueous solution containing (2R,3R)-tartaric acid (2.0 g) and NaBr (8.0 g) at 100 C for 1 h. The pH value of this solution had been adjusted to 3.2 with 1 mol/ dm3 NaOH. After removal of the solution by decantation, the catalyst was successively washed with a 20-ml portion of deionized water, two 100-ml portions of methanol, and two 30-ml portions of tetrahydrofuran (THF). (2) Hydrogenation of MO. The RNi catalyst was modified with 50 ml of an aqueous solution of (2R,3R)-tartaric acid (0.5 g) and NaBr (4.5 g) at pH 3.2 for 1 h at 100 C. The washing of the catalyst was carried out using deionized water ( 5 ml), methanol (25 ml X 2) , and THF (15 ml) for the hydrogenation of 2-octanone. When the RNi catalyst was prepared from 3.0 g of the alloy, all materials for the modification and washing were used in 3 times the above amounts. 2.3. Hydrogenation of MO or 2-octanone The catalyst thus obtained was employed for the hydrogenation of 2-octanone (8.2 g, 64 mmol) in THF (20 ml) or MAA (5.0 g, 43 mmol) in THF (5.0 ml). The stated amount of carboxylic acid was added to the reaction system and the hydrogenation was carried out at 100 C under an initial hydrogen pressure of 9 X 106 Pa. A 100-ml (for 2-octanone) or a 30-ml (for MAA) autoclave was used as the reaction vessel. After removal of the catalyst by filtration and THF by evaporation, the product was dissolved in ether and washed with a saturated aqueous solution of K2C03 to remove the added carboxylic acid. The ether solution was then dried over anhydrous Na2S04 and concentrated in vacuo. A simple distillation gave hydrogenated products with chemical purities of more than 98% (GLC analyses; CBP20-M25-0.25, at 120 C). 2.4. Determination of optical yield The optical purities of methyl 3-hydroxybutyrate and 2-octanol were determined by polarimetry. Optical purity (%) _ [ a] D o hydrogenated product X 100 [ a] D of pure enantiomer The specific optical rotations of (R)-methyl 3-hydroxybutyrate and (S)-2octanol are - 22.95 (neat) [ 8 ] and + 9.76 (neat) [ 10 ] , respectively. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Hydrogenation of 2-octanone The hydrogenation of 2-octanone over TA-NaBr-MRNi was carried out in the presence of a carboxylic acid. Fig. 1 shows the relationship between the amount of 214 T.

The relation between the optical yield and the amount of monocarboxylic acid in the hydrogenation of 2octanone. pivalic or acetic acid contained in the reaction system and the optical yield. It can be observed that (1) the optical yield without carboxylic acid is negligible ( 3% ), and (2) the optical yield increases steeply with increasing amount of the acid in the reaction system at low acid concentration. When the concentration becomes sufficiently high (pivalic acid/2-octanone> 1.8 (mol/mol), acetic acid/2-octanone>0.3 (mol/mol)), the optical yield tends toward a limiting value (maximal optical yield). Fig. 2 shows the relationship between the amount of succinic or malefic acid in the reaction system and the attained optical yield. The malefic acid in the reaction system was hydrogenated to succinic acid during the hydrogenation of 2-octanone. Thus, the observed effect of the malefic acid would be the sum of the effects of the malefic and succinic acids.

HaraO et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 211-219 215 for attaining the maximal optical yields (succinic or maleic acid/2-octanone = 0.05) are much less than that of pivalic acid. Moreover, their attained maximal optical yields are much lower than that attained by the addition of pivalic acid. The pKa values of the acids used as the additives are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. It appears that the amount of the acid required for attaining the maximal optical yield and the attained maximal optical yield are dependent on the pKa value of the acid. The lower the pKa, the less acid is required for attaining the maximal optical yield. The lower the pKa, the lower the attained maximal optical yield. The pKa values shown in Figs. 1 and 2 are those estimated in their aqueous solutions [ 11 ] . Those in the mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran, 2-octanone, and 2-octanol should be different from those in water. However, the structure effects on pKa values in water still largely persist in the mixed organic solvent. Thus the order of their pKa values in the mixed solvent can be assumed to be largely the same as that in water. The pKa dependence of the amount required for the maximal optical yield can be accounted for by the following hypothesis. The conjugate bases (RCOO-) or protons (H+) from the added carboxylic acids (RCOOH) play an important role in the improvement of the optical yield. When the conjugate bases take part in the improvement of the optical yield, the resultant optical yield is presumed to depend on the structure of the conjugate base, i.e., that of the carboxylic acid. When the protons from the added carboxylic acids take part in the optical yield improvement, the maximal optical yield should be independent of the structure of the added carboxylic acid. The present results show that the improvement in the optical yield during the hydrogenation of 2-alkanone results from the conjugate base. 3.2. Hydrogenation of MO The hydrogenation of MAA was carried out in the presence of 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid, using TA-NaBr-MRNi prepared from 1.0 or 3.0 g of the Raney nickel alloy (Fig. 3) . The optical yields increase gradually by increasing the amount of 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid in the reaction system until the maximal values are attained. The amounts of the carboxylic acid required for attaining the maximal optical yields are dependent on the amount of catalyst. When more TA-NaBrMRNi is used, more carboxylic acid is required. This fact suggests the interaction between the added carboxylic acid and the catalyst surface or the adsorbed tartrate results in the improvement of the optical yield. Table 1 and Fig. 4 show the relationship between the amount of added carboxylic acid and the attained optical yield, together with the pKa values of the added acids. The maximal optical yields attained by the addition of carboxylic acids are similar (84-87%) to each other, regardless of the kind of added carboxylic acid. On the other hand, the amounts required for attaining the maximal optical yields are remarkably dependent on the structure of the added acid. The results in Table 1 and Fig. 4 show the pKa depend- 216 T.

The higher the pKa, the more carboxylic acid is required. From the above findings we can assume that the protons generated from the added carboxylic acid play an important role in the improvement of the optical yield for the hydrogenation of a 8-ketoester. 3.3. Adsorption species differentiating enantiofaces of 2-alkanones and (3ketoesters In the preparation of TA-NaBr-MRNi, the RNi was modified with an aqueous solution containing tartaric acid (TAHZ) and sodium bromide. The pH value of this solution had been adjusted to 3.2 with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide [ 7-8 ] . Most of the tartaric acid in the modification solution at pH 3.2 is in the form Table 1 Effects of carboxylic acids on optical yield of hydrogenation of MAAa Carboxylic acid pK.

When the RNi catalyst is modified at a high temperature (100 C) using the above modification solution, the surface of the RNi is corroded to generate Ni2+ [ 8, 12-15 ] . In this process, the TAHNa in the solution is changed to TANaNil /2. Thus the main adsorption species of the tartaric acid on the RNi can be assumed to be TANaNit/2. When carboxylic acid is added to the reaction system, there is the following equilibrium between the adsorbed TANaNil/2 and the added carboxylic acid (RCOOH). TANaNiI /2 + RCOOH -- TAHNil /2 + RCOO- + Na+ (1) TAHNil/2 + RCOOH -- TAH2 +RCOO- + 1 /2Ni2+ (2) The equilibrium concentrations of TANaNil/2, TAHNiI/2, and TAH2 are dependent on the amounts and the pKa values of the tartaric acid and the added carboxylic acid. The amount of adsorbed tartrates on the catalyst was evaluated to be 1.0 X 10-4 mol/g MRNi [8]. The amounts of added carboxylic acids are 1.8X 10-1 mol (pivalic acid, pKa = 5.01, Fig. 1) in the hydrogenation of 2-octanone and 1.0 X 10- 3 mol (acetic acid, pKa = 4.75, Table 1) in the hydrogenation of MAA. When these facts and the pKa value of tartaric acid (pKal = 2.93, pK.2 = 4.23) are taken into account, it is reasonable to assume that a considerable amount of the TANaNil/2 changes into TAHNil/2. It is widely known that tartaric acid can form a stable salt with transition metals. Therefore, the equilibrium of Eq. 2 should lie well to the side of TAHNil/2+RCOOH. Thus under the working conditions of this catalyst, TANaNiI /2 and/or TAHNil /2 could be the major adsorption species of tartaric acid [2]. As previously mentioned, the results in Figs. 1 and 2 are explained by the idea that the improvement in the optical yield of the hydrogenation of 2-alkanone results 218 T. Haraaa et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 211-219 from the conjugate base (RCOO-) of the added acid. The conjugate base could form a surface complex with the TANaNiI/2 and/or TAHN'I/2 on the catalyst. The groups taking part in the complex formation may be COO- in the conjugate base, and OH, Na+, or COOH in TANaNiI/2 or TAHNil/2. We reported a schematic representation of the surface complex on the catalyst in a previous paper [6] . The reported model contains the added carboxylic acid itself (RCOOH) as a component instead of its conjugate base. The molecular orientation of the revised model containing a conjugate base would not be very different from that of our earlier model. Fig. 5 shows a possible molecular orientation of the surface complex. This orientation is depicted under the assumption that the conformation of tartrate anion [ 16] is not changed by the complex formation. The coordination of Ni2+ with O(1) and O(2) in TAHNil /2 is assumed in Fig. 5 [ 17] . 2-Alkanone approaching the catalyst surface is fixed to the surface complex through hydrogen bonding with the OH group including O (l) [ 6 ] . The efficiency of the enantioface-differentiation is affected by the bulkiness of the R group in the RCOO- during the hydrogenation of 2-alkanone. 13-Ketoester can form two hydrogen bonds with the complex through the two OH groups in the complex and the two C=O groups in 8-ketoester [ 18]. The combination of the two hydrogen bondings between the /3-ketoester and the complex can be assumed to be stable. Moreover, the amount of the added carboxylic acid required for attaining the maximal optical yield during the hydrogenation of MAA is much smaller than that required during the hydrogenation of 2-octanone (acetic acid/MAA=0.02 (mol/mol), pivalic acid/2-octanone=2.8 (mol/mol) ) Thus most of the conjugate base in the surface complex would be excluded by the ~O(1) TOI112 0(2), Ni , Conjugate base O C O H Fig. 5.

The ratio of TAHNi1,2/TANaNit,2 on the RNi catalyst is increased by the addition of a carboxylic acid. The change in this ratio may be a reason why the optical yield is somewhat increased by the addition of carboxylic acid. The enantioface-differentiation of O should be carried out mainly by the TAHNit,2 on the catalyst. In conclusion, we could clarify the participation of the conjugate bases and protons generated from the added carboxylic acid in the enantioface-differentiation of 2-alkanones and 6-ketoesters.

        "dc:description": "A tartaric acid—sodium bromide—modified Raney nickel (TANaBrMRNi) is a unique catalyst for the enantioface-differentiating hydrogenation of 2-alkanones and β-ketoesters. The addition of carboxylic acid to the reaction system results in improvement of the optical yield over this catalyst. In this study, the enantioface-differentiating hydrogenations of 2-octanone and methyl acetoacetate were carried out to clarify how the added carboxylic acids improve the efficiency of the enantio-differentiation of the substrates over TANaBrMRNi. The participation of the conjugate bases and protons generated from the added carboxylic acid during the hydrogenation of 2-alkanones and β-ketoesters is proposed.",
