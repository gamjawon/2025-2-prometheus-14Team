Nalewajski*,1, A.M. Koster, T. Bredow and K. Jug* Theoretische Chemie, Uniuersitat Hannover, Am Kleinen Felde 30, 3000 Hannover (Germany); tel. (+48-12)336377ext.212, fax. (+48-12)12340515 Abstract Semiempirical charge sensitivity analysis (CSA) in the atoms-in-molecules (AIM) resolution has been used to predict catalytic activity towards the water adsorption of realistic cluster representations of the Ti02 (110) and (100) surfaces. The input hardness tensors have been generated on the basis of siNDoi atomic charges of the symmetry-restricted optimized cluster geometries. The mechanism of the H20 adsorption and dissociation on the catalytically more active Ti02 (110) surface is reexamined in terms of relevant AIM Fukui function data and related charge sensitivities of the eigenvectors of the hardness tensor. The chemisorption data for the molecular adsorption of H20 on the preferred five-fold coordinated Ti site are used to predict the course of the charge transfer included dissociation of the adsorbate, in which the H is released and combined with the lattice OZ- to form another OH fragment. A small energy barrier of - 5 kcal/ mol for this process is estimated from SD.1DOi calculations. This corresponds to the transition structure of a tilted molecule and further supports the predicted course of the water dissociation. An effect is observed of the enhanced reactivity of a top Ti site due to the presence of the rutile second-layer atoms.

It has also been demonstrated [2,8,9] that a substantial concentration of the reactivity information is achieved within the hardness-decoupled, normal representation of the independent electron population modes in the system, i.e., the eigenvectors of n [4,6 ] . The most important normal modes for predicting relative site-selectivities have been identified and shown for a number of illustrative applications [ 2,4,6,8,9 ] . The previously reported applications of the normal-mode CSA include Ni and V205 catalytic clusters, as well as the chemisorption of CO and H2 on these clusters, respectively [ 8,9 ] , involving a net adsorbate (A) --+ substrate (S) CT (nucleophilic attack: dNs-=NCT > 0) . The preferred adsorption site then naturally follows from the criterion of the minimum AIM Fukui function (FF) criterion, fi -oNi/aN=minimum, (2 ) where N-=ZiNi is the global number of electrons. For such sites the A-.S CT is least inhibited by the adsorption site. The sites exhibiting a negative FF index should even strengthen this coordination bond, since they locally diminish their electron populations when the substrate as a whole receives electrons from the adsorbate. Clearly, for an electrophilic attack, leading to the A+--S coordination, NCT < 0, the maximum AIM FF criterion should be adopted to identify relative site preferences. The normal mode resolutions of the AIM FF distribution f and the CT energy ECT demonstrate that only very few modes are crucial for predicting cluster reactivity towards a nucleophilic attack. One should expect an exceptionally reactive surface when this subset of normal modes includes the softest mode of a system, which exhibits a dominating polarization component (P ), beside the CT part necessary for the mode to be active in the A-. S coordination. It should be emphasized at this point that the P modes should determine the cluster (surface) reactivity when the AE-S adsorption takes place, since the activation barrier [ 7 ] in the substrate associated with a removal of NCT electrons from S, should be relatively low when such modes participate strongly in the CT reaction coordinate f. General site-selectivity trends emerging from the criterion (2) and the normal mode analysis, respectively, were in agreement with one another [ 8,9 ] , and - in the case of the vanadium oxide catalyst [9 ] - with predictions following from earlier SCF MO studies [ 10 ] . The classical problem of the smallest adequate cluster representation of the active catalyst site and the effect of saturatirig the cluster's artificial terminal valencies, on the border with the neglected crystal remainder, have also been investigated in terms of the charge sensitivity data. However, a crucial test of the performance of the CSA would require an investigation of a detailed, experimentally conjectured molecular adsorption-dissociation mechanism, besides the usual analysis of general features, such as differences in catalytic activity of distinct crystallographic cuts. R.F Nalewajski et al./J. Mol. Catal. 82 (1993) 407-423 409 Such a mechanism has recently been formulated for the water adsorption on the rutile surfaces, on the basis of the synchrotron radiation resonant photoemission data and the information obtained from other spectroscopic studies [ 11 ] . It has been established [ 12 ] that, at room temperature, H20 is adsorbed molecularly on the (100) surface, and dissociatively on the (110) surface. The H20-Ti02 (110) adsorption-dissociation mechanism of Kurtz et al. [ 11 ] identifies an in-plane (atop) five-fold coordinated Ti site as the preferred adsorption site in the nearly-perfect surface. An interesting site-site coupling effect has also been observed: \"...the occupation of one adsorption site by dissociated OH fragments quenches the activity of neighboring sites with respect to additional H20 adsorption and dissociation...\" [ 11 ] . In the present work we have applied the CSA in the AIM resolution to study the CT-related sensitivities of the Ti02 (110) and (100) model cluster surfaces and the respective H20-Ti02 (110) chemisorption system. The primary objective was to see whether the known experimental trends in catalytic activity and the above molecular H20 adsorption-dissociation mechanism on the rutile (110) surface, are indeed supported by the topology of the CT sensitivities in model cluster representations of the surface. Summary of charge sensitivities Among many charge response sensitivities of interest in the theory of chemical reactivity [ 1-8 ] the FF indices of Eqn. (2) play a fundamental role in investigating the CT processes [5-9, 16-18]. Within the normal representation [4,6] of the q eigenvectors (principal ages reference system): UTqU=h, U~T=I, ha,6=haaa,8 (3a) one defines the collective displacements in the AIM electron populations: dva=dN Ua, a=1,2 .... (3b) where Ua is the ath column of U, and the related normal FF data: Fa=f Ua=a va/aN> 0 (3c) where the inequality of Eqn. (3c) fixes phases of the CT-active normal modes. The principal hardness, ha, of Eqn. (3a) measures the response in the ath normal mode chemical potential, #,,, =#U = 49EI49 Pa (3d) per unit displacement dva: h = aftala v (3e ) The partitioning of fi into the normal mode contributions: 410 R.F.

Catal. 82 (1993) 407-423 411 which is called the energetic probability weight [2,8], measures the relative contribution from mode a to the CT energy. It follows from the previous applications of the normal mode CSA [ 2,8,9 ] that the distribution of {oja} is strongly dominated by the non-selective hardest mode H, in which all constituent atoms undergo practically the same shift in the electron population. Since this background mode does not distinguish between local sites in the molecule, the site-selectivity trends are therefore determined by the second-highest co,, mode, E. The cases in which this mode is identical with the softest (S) mode (lowest ha, a=1) of the system, S=E, may be immediately identified as exceptionally reactive, since the reaction path then includes a relatively strong component of the most facile channel of electron redistribution in a molecule; for hl < 0 the charge distribution is unstable along the vl displacement. In symmetric systems the antisymmetric modes describe the purely internal system charge redistribution (P-active, CT-inactive); only symmetric modes include a nonzero projection onto the CT reaction coordinate, beside a varying degree of internal charge polarization. The soft modes involve charge redistributions between neighboring atoms (large number of nodes); with increasing mode hardness ha groups of neighboring atoms, of increasing size, act in the same phase. As demonstrated in the previous development [ 1-7 ] all the above quantities are simple functions of the canonical AIM hardness tensor (1) . Charge sensitivities of model cluster representations of rutile surfaces In Fig. 1(a,b) we summarize the models which we have adopted to represent fragments of the (110) and (100) Ti02 surfaces.

[ 13-15 ] , all bond lengths and selected bond angles of the cluster have been optimized within the given symmetries of the ideal surfaces. The relevant geometry data for the rutile (110) and (100) clusters are given in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. drl is the distance of the Ti ( 1 ) atom from the plane of the Surrounding oxygen atoms. Such optimized structures and the resulting atomic net charges were used as the input data in the semiempirical generation of the AIM hardness tensor of the CSA.

Clearly, the unsaturated valencies at the cluster perimeter artificially create low oxidation states of the terminal Ti atoms. However, as we have observed previously [ 9 ] , a saturation of the valenciea of peripheral atoms has only a weak effect upon the CT sensitivities of the interior atoms. It follows from Fig. 1 and Table 3 that Ti surface ions in the (110 ) -type clusters exhibit slightly higher net charges than the similarly placed Ti surface ions in the (100 ) cluster. Moreover, the absolute value of the minimum ( negative ) FF site is an order of magnitude higher on the (110 ) surface. These observations have immediate implications for the preferred H20 adsorption sites, determined - in the case of a nucleophilic ( dN> 0 ) adsorption - by the minimum fj criterion (2). It follows from this reactivity index that the Ti (1 ) site is the preferred adsorption location in the nearly-perfect (110 ) -rutile surface cluster. As we shall argue below, the subsequent H20 dissociation involves a tilt of the adsorbate toward the 0(,) bridging oxygen site, which removes one of the hydrogens. A comparison between the (110 ) and (100 ) surfaces ( see Figs. 2 and 3, R.F Nalewajski et al./J. Mol. Catal. 82 (1993) 407-423 (a) 'Y/.- \\~%r~:! (C) Fig. 3.

The mode characteristics (a.u.) are: hl=0.010, to,=0.002, F,=0.126; hs2=0.192,(1052=0.079, and F52=0.185. RS Nalewajski et al./J. Mol. Catal. 82 (1993) 407-423 415 respectively, and the corresponding entries in Table 3) clearly shows why the (110) cut is more reactive. As can be seen from a comparison of Figs. 2a and 2b, the site differentiation of the AIM FF distribution is strongly dominated by the softest mode (S=E) in the (110) case. The comparison of Figs. 3a, 3b and 3c shows that the (100) -FF distribution of Fig. 3a also carries a substantial component due to a relatively hard E mode (a= 52) , shown in Fig. 3c. This indicates that the cluster charge reorganization accompanying the H20-> Ti02 (100) adsorption is energetically more costly than that following the H20-+Ti02(110) adsorption. Finally, as can be seen in Table 3, the inclusion of the five second-layer atoms, coordinated below the line Ti ( 1 )-Ti (2 ) in the 50-atom (110) cluster, is vital for predicting the high reactivity of the Ti02 (110) surface (compare the fj columns for m=45 and m=50 clusters in Table 3). Namely, in the m=45 cluster, in which these atoms are missing, the absolute fl value is much smaller, and the identities of the S and E modes are different. It follows from this comparison that the m=50 cluster of Fig. la represents the smallest adequate description of the active site on the Ti02 (110) surface. H20-Ti02 (110) chemisorption systems and the H20 dissociation mechanism The atomic charges and charge sensitivity data for water adsorption on the Ti02 (110) surface along the reaction pathway from molecular adsorption through the transition structure (TS) to dissociative adsorption are depicted in Figs. 4-6 and listed in Table 4. Fig. 4 shows the symmetric molecular adsorption in its equilibrium state on the preferred five-fold coordinated Ti ( 1 site. Figure 5 illustrates the effect of a slight tilt of about 2 of the water molecule on the surface towards the transition structure which is seen in Fig. 6. TS corresponds to a maximum of the energy profile along the reaction coordinate (RC) (see Fig. 7) . The corresponding tilt angle in TS is about 21 . As is shown in Figs. 4b and 5b, the AIM FF patterns of the chemisorbed structures are again determined by the topologies of the softest (S=E, a=1) modes shown in Figs. 4c and 5c, respectively. We would like to stress here that hl x 0, and fl, > 0, which qualitatively agrees with the dN=0 energy profile of Fig. 7a. We have added a new degree of freedom to the geometry optimization of the cluster-adsorbate system, an out-of-plane relaxation of the central Ti ( 1 atom, by varying the distance (drl) between the atom and the surface plane. With this new degree of freedom we obtained the transition structure geometry shown in Fig. 6a. The SIND01 potential curve for the H20 dissociation process on the surface is shown in Fig. 7b. It agrees qualitatively with the experimental results [ 11 ] . The SIND01 estimated energy barrier of 5 kcal/Oo1 corresponds 416 R.F. Nalewajski et al. jJ Moi.

This should lead to a stronger H(9)-0(7) interaction, which facilitates dissociation. At the same time, Ti(1)-Ti(4) sites should decrease their electron population along - vs-E. This clearly points towards a strengthening of the Ti ( 1 )O (8) bond, which is indeed manifested by the out-of-surface movement of Ti ( 1 ) ion in TS, as shown in Fig. 7b. Also, in the RC ,,zt~ vs=E direction (see Figs. 4c and 5c) the 0(5,6) sites, coordinated to Ti(1), increase their electron population at the expense of the neighboring titanium atoms. This partly reverses the 0(5,6)-.Till coordination, thus facilitating the out-of-surface movement of Ti(1).The SIND01 calculations suggest that the H20 molecule bends towards one of the bridging oxygen atoms O (7) after this movement of Ti ( 1), and a bond between H(9) and O(7) is formed. There is no substantial energy barrier for breaking of the H(9)-O(8) bond, leading to the formation of two OH groups. In the further course of dissociation of the water molecule on the surface the O(8) atom tilts back to a position above Ti(,). Reference to Fig. 7a also shows that the FF Vector FL (FS-E, FH), representing the equilibrium, spontaneous charge displacement in the chemisorption system, exhibits a negative projection onto RC; notice, however, that this vector corresponds to dN> 0, i.e. to the net inflow of electrons to the system, due for example to the subsequent water adsorption, or the fluctuations in N, resulting from the presence of the cluster environment in a real surface. As can be seen from Table 4, there is a qualitative correspondence between the charge shifts from molecular adsorption to TS as calculated with silmol and the predicted trend from U;S=E (a= 1) depicted in Fig. 4c.

Moreover, as can be seen from Table 4 and Figs. 5b and 5c the small tilt of the H20 molecule on the surface causes a pronounced deviation from symmetry in the AIM FF and Uis=E (a =1) mode, while the charge is almost symmetric. At the transition structure the softest mode Uis=E (a =1) of the H20Ti02 (110) system is strongly localized on the adsorbed H20 and the bridging oxygen atom O (7 ) as shown in Fig. 6c. This indicates that the water dissociation on the rutile surface can be described as a local phenomenon which only involves the bridging oxygen atom from the surface. The AIM FF distributions of Figs. 4b, 5b and 6b allow one to make predictions concerning the effect of subsequent change in the global number of electrons, i.e. reduction (dN>0) or oxidation (dN<0) of the chemi-sorption cluster, resulting, eg., from the next adsorption (s) and/or the fluctuation in the cluster global number of electrons due to the surface remainder or the catalyst support [5,6]. It immediately follows from the plotted contours (see also Table 4) that all neighbouring Ti sites, around the primary adsorption site, have large and positive fi values, so that they cannot be expected to act as the preferred sites for the next adsorption; this observation is somewhat related to the hypothesis already mentioned [ 11 ] that the initial adsorption site may cause the destruction of the activity of neighboring adsorption sites. A shift dN> 0 will act in the vs-E direction (phases as shown in Figs. 4b and 6b), opposite to the dissociation RC, thus weakening 0(8)->Ti(l) bond due to the observed increase of the electron population on the Ti 1 site. The reverse effect will be observed for the dN<0 fluctuation (reverse phases of Figs. 4b and 6b): the extra 0(8)--+T(1) donation due to a marked increase of ql (strengthening the bond). Such CT-induced processes may play a vital role on real surfaces, for which no processes can be expected to proceed at constant N of a small surface fragments. To conclude this discussion of charge sensitivities of the H20-rutile (110 ) clusters, we observe (see Fig. 7a) that the already small dN= 0 barrier along RC ( - 5 kcal/mol) can be lowered yet further when the constraint of constant N is lifted, i.e. when the process qualitatively goes along the 1-> 4-> 3 path, with Fig. 7. (a) Schematic and (b) sitlnoi reaction profile for the molecular-+ dissociative adsorption rearrangement of water on the 50-atom (110) rutile surface cluster. In the schematic reaction path the dN=0 (P) rearrangement (changing external potential v due to the nuclei), to which the 1120 tilt angle coordinate refers, is dominated by the S= E (a =1) mode, which exhibits charge instability, while the dN9 0 (CT) processes are dominated by the H(a=53 ), nonselective background mode. Note that structure 4, reached along the - vs-E direction, corresponds to v2 and dN> 0. Fig. 6b shows the interpolated reaction path along the H(9)-O(e) bond. The values in the second row on the abscissa correspond to the out-of-plane relaxation of the central Ti(,) atom (drl). The sniooi barrier height, E(2)-E(1), is about 5 kcal/mol and the reaction energy E(3)-E(1) is about 70 kcal/mol. 422 R.F. Nalewajski et al./J Mol. Catal. 82 (1993) 407-423 dN> 0 at the TS structure. Clearly this influence of the cluster remainder or the catalyst support can easily be effected on real catalytic surfaces, and it has to be included in any realistic hypotheses about the mechanisms of elementary catalytic reactions. Conclusion We have demonstrated that the CSA correctly predicts the difference in catalytic activities of the rutile (110) and (100) surfaces, predicting in the former case the five-fold coordinated Ti sites of the nearly-perfect surface to be the preferred adsorption sites. A higher reactivity of the (110) -clusters is due to the S and E normal modes being identical, while the E mode of the (100) -cluster exhibits a relatively high principal hardness value. As we have demonstrated, a pattern of the AIM FF distribution of the rutile (110) and the Hz0-rutile (110) clusters is dominated by the shape of the S normal mode, i.e. strongly polarizational mode, corresponding practically to the dN=0 RC. This explains why the dN=0 barrier for the dissociation of the adsorbed water molecule is relatively low ( - 5 kcal/mol), despite a bending of the Ti(,)-O(,,) bond in the TS structure. A qualitative analysis of the E(N, v ) surface (Fig. 7a) of the chemisorption cluster reveals that this barrier can be practically eliminated when the dN= 0 constraint is lifted, so that the reaction path goes through TS corresponding to a slightly higher global number of electrons of the cluster. Clearly, such fluctuations in N take place on real catalytic surfaces, due to the influence of the cluster environment. All these reasons seem to rationalize the experimental observation that H20 is dissociatively adsorbed on the (110) surface at room temperature. It has also been demonstrated that a shape of the crucial S=E mode (or that of the FF distribution) can be used to predict gross features of the charge reorganization in a molecular reactive system along RC. Therefore, the CSA can be used as a simple diagnostic tool supplementing the SCF MO calculations [ 21 ] . The present and previous applications of the CSA to catalytic clusters already justify a cautious optimism about the method's adequacy for predicting both overall and detailed features of elementary catalytic processes. The normal analysis in the framework of the hardness tensor eigenvectors, comprises the vital reactivity information scattered in the multidimensional, electronic structure manifold of reactive systems, into a subset of 2-3 crucial modes, thus facilitating further qualitative predictions, and generalizations [ 22 ] . Clearly, the eventual realization of the full potential of such an approach still requires additional conceptual and applicative extensions. In particular, the direct charge sensitivity estimate of the reaction rates and the inclusion of the third-order effects represent the current major objectives in CSA development. Some progress along these lines has already been reported [ 7,23 ] . R.F. Nalewajski et al./J Mot.

Semiempirical charge sensitivity analysis (CSA) in the atoms-in-molecules (AIM) resolution has been used to predict catalytic activity towards the water adsorption of realistic cluster representations of the TiO2 (110) and (100) surfaces. The input hardness tensors have been generated on the basis of Sindo1 atomic charges of the symmetry-restricted optimized cluster geometries. The mechanism of the H2O adsorption and dissociation on the catalytically more active TiO2 (110) surface is reexamined in terms of relevant AIM Fukui function data and related charge sensitivities of the eigenvectors of the hardness tensor. The chemisorption data for the molecular adsorption of H2O on the preferred five-fold coordinated Ti site are used to predict the course of the charge transfer included dissociation of the adsorbate, in which the H is released and combined with the lattice O2− to form another OH fragment. A small energy barrier of ∼ 5 kcal/mol for this process is estimated from Sindo1 calculations. This corresponds to the transition structure of a tilted molecule and further supports the predicted course of the water dissociation. An effect is observed of the enhanced reactivity of a top Ti site due to the presence of the rutile second-layer atoms.
