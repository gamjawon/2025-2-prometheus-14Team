Urea electrosynthesis plays a vital role in the nitrogen cycle, promoting carbon neutrality while also being energy-efficient. However, the complexities involved in the simultaneous of carbon and nitrogen-containing species significantly hinder the selectivity and yield of urea. In this study, we report a CuZn bimetallic catalyst that is capable of converting CO2 and NO3 ⁻ into urea, with a maximum Faraday efficiency of 40% at -0.6 V vs. RHE, alongside an impressive urea yield rate of 304.8 mmol h⁻¹ gcat ⁻¹ at -0.9 V vs. RHE, surpassing the performance of both monometallic Cu and Zn catalysts. In situ spectroscopic analysis demonstrates that the Cu sites within CuZn facilitates the adsorption and activation of CO2 and NO3 ⁻, while Zn sites additionally facilitate CO2 adsorption and reduces the adsorption strength of *CO and *NH2 on the catalyst surface, collectively promoting the formation of *CONH2 as a key intermediate in urea synthesis. This study highlights the unique role of zinc in urea synthesis, offers new insights into optimizing the performance of copper-zinc catalysts, and serves as a valuable reference for future research on the role of zinc in urea synthesis.

Introduction Urea is a critical nitrogen fertilizer that significantly enhances food crop yields [1–3]. Traditional urea synthesis is primarily governed by the Bosch-Meiser process, where carbon dioxide (CO2) and ammonia (NH3) are reacted at elevated temperatures (150 °C–200 °C) and high pressures (150–250 bar) [4]. This process consumes 80% of global NH3 production and releases substantial quantities of CO2 [5,6]. Furthermore, NH3 is primarily produced via the Haber-Bosch process, which accounts for approximately 1–2% of global energy consumption and 1.5% of global CO2 emissions [7,8]. Therefore, utilizing renewable energy to power the urea production, as an alternative to conventional energy-intensive technologies, is imperative [9]. On the other hand, the utilization of N-containing fertilizer in agriculture, along with industrial emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, contributes to the accumulation of nitrate (NO3 ⁻) wastes in water, with excessive NO3 ⁻ intake potentially causing severe health issues [10]. Recently, employing nitrogen pollutants (i.e., NO3 ⁻) as the nitrogen source and greenhouse gas (i.e., CO2) as the carbon source for urea synthesis through electrochemical co-reduction under mild reaction conditions has attracted much attention, as this process can simultaneously address environmental and energy challenges, preserve carbon and nitrogen balance, and achieve a mutually beneficial outcome [11–15]. The NO3 ⁻/CO2 co-reduction process for urea synthesis is highly complex, involving 18 proton couplings and 16 electron transfers. During the co-reduction process, CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), nitrogen reduction (NO3RR), and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) take place at similar potentials, leading to poor Faradaic efficiency (FE) for urea production [16–24]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop highly selective catalysts to enhance the co-reduction process for urea production. Effective co-reduction electrocatalysts must fulfill at least three essential criteria: efficient co-adsorption and co-activation of CO2 and NO3 ⁻, active sites that promote CN couplings, and strong suppression of by-products formation [25–27]. Cu-based catalysts have attract great attentions in recent years for urea synthesis [28], as they are not only capable of reducing CO2 to various products (e.g., CO, CH4, C2H4, C2H5OH etc.) [29–34], but also excel in the reduction of NO3 ⁻ to NH3 [35,36], thereby promoting the CN coupling from different reaction intermediates. This, however, also indicates that the urea selectivity of pure Cu catalysts is strongly affected by the CO2RR and NO3RR side reactions, suggesting the need for tailoring of the adsorption energy of different key intermediates independently. To overcome the scaling relationships between the absorption energies of different intermediates on the Cu surface, researchers have attempted to design bi- or multi-metallic Cu-based catalysts, including Cu-Mo [37], CuPd1Rh1-DAA [38], Cu/Ti [39], Cu-Bi [40], BIF-29(Cu) [19], and Cu/PI-500 etc. [41]. However, the selectivity for NO2 ⁻ and NH3 is often higher than that for urea, implying that the catalytic activity of Cu for NO3 - reduction is higher than that for CO2. Interestingly, Zn has been recently considered as a good promoter for Cu to enhance the urea selectivity, despite that Zn has been well recognized as a CO-selectivity metal in CO2RR. For example, Meng et al. synthesized a Cu@Zn core–shell catalyst and obtained an improved urea yield rate (7.29 μmol cm−2 h−1 at −1.02 V vs RHE) [42]. They suggested that the electron transfer from Zn to Cu could facilitate the formation of *CO and *NH2 intermediates and promote their coupling to form urea product. Similarly, Luo et al. prepared a hybrid Zn/Cu catalyst by spray-coating an incomplete layer of Zn on top of the Cu layer and achieved significant higher urea yield rate (16 μmol cm−2 h−1 at −0.8 V vs RHE) compared to the pure Cu catalyst [43]. However, they proposed a relay catalytic mechanism between Zn and Cu sites, where Zn is active for the C–N coupling step and Cu is active the following protonation step. These results suggest that while Zn is a promising candidate for the development of urea-selective Cu-based bimetallic catalysts, its role remains a subject of debate. To better explore the potential of CuZn based bimetallic catalysts in the electrosynthesis of urea and further understanding the C–N coupling mechanism, in this work, we attempted to overcome the structural heterogeneity of the above mentioned catalytic systems by synthesizing a series of homogeneous CuZn bimetallic catalysts. Specifically, with an optimal ratio of Cu and Zn, (i.e., atomic ratio of Cu:Zn at 90:10), the Faradaic efficiency for urea (FEurea) reached 40% at −0.6 V vs. RHE with a urea yield of 304.8 mmol h⁻¹ gcat ⁻¹ at −0.9 V vs. RHE, surpassing that of Cu (30%, 214.5 mmol h⁻¹ gcat ⁻¹) and Zn (8.4%, 26 mmol h⁻¹ gcat ⁻¹). By integrating in situ Raman and infrared spectroscopic experiments, we demonstrated that both Cu and Zn exist in a metallic state under urea electrosynthesis conditions. We identified *CO and *NH2 as key intermediates adsorbed on the bimetallic CuZn surface, which combine to form *CONH2, a crucial intermediate in urea production. While the bare Cu catalyst is active for urea synthesis, the incorporation of optimized amount of Zn could absorb more CO2 and decrease the adsorption strength of both *CO and *NH2, thereby enhancing the CN coupling efficiency for urea formation. Results and discussion Five CuZn catalysts with varying content ratios were prepared using co-reduction method, with CuCl2·2H2O and ZnCl2 as raw materials and sodium borohydride as the reducing agent. For comparison, pure Cu and pure Zn were synthesized using the same method. The CuZn catalysts were designated as CuxZn1-x (x = at.%) and named as Cu25Zn75, Cu50Zn50, Cu60Zn40, Cu80Zn20, and Cu90Zn10, respectively. There final content of Cu and Zn was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) (Table S1), where the results showed that the ratios of Cu and Zn agree well with the initial ratios of the CuCl2 and ZnCl2 salts. The crystal structures of the as-synthesized CuZn catalysts were studied by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 1 a). Distinct XRD peaks were observed at 43.2°, 50.23°, and 74°, corresponding to the (111), (200), and (220) facets of metallic Cu (PDF No. 04–0836). Interestingly, diffraction peaks corresponding to Cu2O (PDF No. 77–0199) and ZnO (PDF No. 36–1451) were also observed with relatively low intensities, possibly due to the oxidation of CuZn by air exposure. As expected, the diffraction peaks corresponding to Cu and Cu2O intensify with increasing Cu content, while the peaks associated with ZnO gradually weaken and eventually disappear with decreasing Zn content. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the typical Cu90Zn10 sample revealed a highly porous structure consists of nanoparticles (Fig. 1b). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images indicate that the average size of the nanoparticles is approximately 12.8 nm (Fig. 1c, 1d). The TEM images of the control samples (Fig. S1), however, reveal that Cu exhibits a cubic nanoparticle structure with wide size distribution (c.a., 50–200 nm), while Zn exhibits a nanosheet morphology. These results indicate that the introduction of Zn during the sample preparation process disrupts the crystallization process of Cu, transforming the morphology from nanocubes of pure Cu to nanoparticles of CuZn. This is in good agreement with the XRD results, where the average crystal size of the Cu(111) facet decreased gradually from ∼28 nm to ∼7 nm with the addition of Zn from 0 to 75 at.% (Table S2). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping confirmed that the distributions of Cu, Zn, and O were highly overlapped (Figs. 1e, S2), indicating the homogeneous distribution of Cu and Zn, and further confirming the partial oxidation of the CuZn catalyst. The surface chemical composition and valence states of Cu90Zn10 were analyzed by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 1f). The high-resolution Cu 2p spectra for Cu and Cu90Zn10 show two main peaks at 932.73 eV and 952.5 eV, corresponding to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks of Cu0 or Cu1+, respectively. Interestingly, the Cu LMM auger spectra indicate that copper is in metallic state in both Cu and Cu90Zn10 catalysts (Fig. 1h), which is somehow inconsistent with the results obtained from XRD. We hypothesize that this discrepancy is possibly caused by the reduction of the copper surface under the high vacuum conditions during XPS analysis. On the other hand, Zn LMM spectra indicate that zinc in the pure Zn and Cu90Zn10 catalysts remains oxidation state, agreeing with the XRD results (Fig. 1g, i) [44]. Overall, these results confirmed the successful synthesis of CuZn bimetallic catalysts with homogeneous Cu and Zn distributions. To screen the optimal ratio of Cu and Zn in CuZn bimetallic catalysts for urea synthesis, the electrochemical co-reduction of CO2 and NO3 ⁻ was performed over Cu, Cu90Zn10, Cu80Zn20, Cu60Zn40, Cu50Zn50, Cu25Zn75 and Zn catalysts at −0.6 V vs. RHE in an H-type cell at room temperature (Fig. 2 a). The urea product was quantified using urease decomposition method (Fig. S5). For pure Cu, the FEurea reached 30%. When 10% Zn was introduced, the FEurea increased by 33.3%, peaking at 40%. However, as the Zn was further increased, a decline in FEurea was observed. In the case of pure Zn, the FEurea dropped to as low as 1.8%. This result shows that the content of Zn cannot be too much. In the case of low Zn content, Cu90Zn10 was able to promote the desorption of the key intermediate *CO from *NH2 and enhance the CN coupling. Whereas, at higher Zn content, Cu80Zn20, Cu60Zn40, Cu50Zn50 and Cu25Zn75 have poor activity due to reduced adsorption of CO2 and NO3 -, while pure Zn has the lowest performance due to the difficulty in adsorbing NO3 - and CO2. Therefore, in the following studies, we choose Cu90Zn10 for detailed analysis. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was initially conducted on the Cu90Zn10 catalyst in various electrolytic conditions, using CO2- or Ar-saturated KHCO3 and KNO3 solutions (Fig. S3). The results indicate that, in Ar saturated electrolyte, Cu90Zn10 could effectively activate and reduce NO3 ⁻. Upon addition of CO2 as a reactant, the current density decreased within the same potential range, suggesting a possible change in the reaction pathway during co-electrolysis. The urea synthesis efficiencies of Cu90Zn10, along with that of the Cu and Zn control samples, were accurately measured using the chronoamperometry (CA) method over a potential range of −0.4 to −0.9 V vs. RHE. The chronoamperometry curves demonstrated that the current densities of Cu90Zn10 at all potentials were significantly higher than those of pure Cu and Zn, suggesting that Cu90Zn10 may exhibit superior catalytic activity for urea production (Fig. S4). Fig. 2b shows that for the Cu sample, the FEurea as the function of the applied potential exhbites a volcano-type curve, peaking at 30% at −0.6 V vs. RHE. The maximum yield of 214.5 mmol h⁻¹ gcat ⁻¹ was obtained at −0.9 V vs. RHE (Fig. 2c). The FEurea for Zn peaked at 8.4% at −0.9 V vs. RHE, with a yield of 26 mmol h⁻¹ gcat ⁻¹. The FEurea profile of Cu90Zn10 resembled that of Cu, with the optimal FE of 40% achieved at −0.6 V vs. RHE and the highest yield reached 304.8 mmol h⁻¹ gcat ⁻¹ at −0.9 V vs. RHE, surpassing that of the best catalyst reported to date (Table S6). The urea yield is seven times higher than that of Cu@Zn nanowires previously reported and 3.2 times greater than that of Zn/Cu hybrid catalysts. [42,43] Consequently, the Cu90Zn10 catalyst enhanced the FE by 33.3% and 379% and the yield by 42.1% and 1072.3% compared to pure Cu and pure Zn catalysts, respectively. These results clearly indicate that the addition of Zn significantly improved the urea synthesis performance. To further understand the product distribution, by-products generated during co-electrolysis were quantified using gas chromatography (GC) and UV spectrophotometry (Fig. S6, S7). Table S3, S4 and S5 shows that for Cu90Zn10, Cu, and Zn, the FE of both H2 and CO increased with decreasing potential, while the FE of NO2 - decreased with decreasing potential, indicating the occurrence of H2O, CO2, and NO3 - reduction reactions. Notably, for Cu90Zn10 and Cu, the FEs of NH3 exhibit a volcano-like trend similar to that of urea, implying that the precursor of NH3 is pertinent to urea synthesis. We then investigated CN coupling preferences by comparing the urea FEs of Cu90Zn10 and Cu relative to other byproducts. The ratio between FEC N-coupling and FEnon-C-N-coupling indicates selectivity for CN coupling is relative to non-C-N-coupling reactions (Fig. 2d). The FENH3/FEurea values were found to be higher than other ratios for both Cu90Zn10 and Cu, demonstrating the greater selectivity of NH3 during urea synthesis. In contrast to Cu90Zn10, the primary by-products of Cu (i.e., NH3, NO2 -, CO, and H2) exhibited higher FE ratios relative to urea, indicating that Cu is more prone to engaging in the competitive NO3RR, CO2RR, and HER reactions. To compare the intrinsic activities of the three catalysts, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was evaluated using double layer capacitance (Cdl). As shown in Fig. S8, the Cdl values of the Cu, Zn and Cu90Zn10 samples are very similar. Additionally, the charge transfer resistance of the catalysts was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The Nyquist plot presented in Fig. S9 showes that the charge transfer resistance of Cu90Zn10 is comparable to that of Cu and Zn. This indicates that the improved urea performance of Cu90Zn10 is not due to an increase in active sites or an enhancement in charge transfer rate, but rather an enhancement of the intrinsic activity. To understand the origin of the enhanced urea synthesis performance of CuZn bimetallic catalysts, in situ Raman spectra of Cu90Zn10 and Cu were measured to monitor the property changes and adsorbed reaction intermediates during electrolysis (Fig. 3 a, b), with potentials ranging from open circuit potential (OCP) to –0.9 V vs. RHE. At the OCP condition, for both Cu and Cu90Zn10 samples, the peak with a Raman shift of 316 cm-1 is likely associated with Cu oxides, and peaks near 511 and 610 cm-1 are associated with Cuδ+, corresponding to the T2 g vibrational mode and T1 u mode of Cu2O [45], consistent with the XRD results. However, due to the low content of Zn, we did not observe any Raman peaks associated with ZnO. During the reduction reaction, copper oxides on the surfaces of Cu90Zn10 and Cu were fully reduced from –0.4 V vs. RHE, indicating that metallic Cu is the active species for urea synthesis. Peaks at 706 cm-1 and 1076 cm-1 can be assigned to the adsorbed species of CO2 and NO3 ⁻ [46,47], confirming that both Cu90Zn10 and Cu are active for co-electrolysis of CO2 and NO3 ⁻. With the decrease of the applied potential, Raman bands at 364 cm-1, 1350 cm-1, and 1550 cm-1 appeared on both Cu90Zn10 and Cu, which can be attributed to the restricted stretching vibrations of *CO on the Cu active site, the symmetric N–O stretches of adsorbed NO2 -, and the stretching vibrations of *NH2, respectively [48–50]. Although the weak Raman signals of urea prevent the detection of the CN stretching mode [51], the observation of these key intermediates, along with the alignment of the potential-dependent FE of NH3 and the FE profile for urea, leads us to propose that CN coupling occurs through the coupling of *CO and *NH2, with *CONH2 serving as a crucial intermediate in urea formation. To further elucidate the reaction mechanism of urea production on Cu and Cu90Zn10, in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) measurements were performed. Fig. 3c, d present the IR signals of Cu90Zn10 and Cu, respectively, obtained during the electrocatalytic co-reduction of NO3 ⁻ and CO2 at potentials ranging from OCP to −0.9 V vs. RHE. Signals corresponding to N (*NH2 at 1639 cm-1) and C (*OCO at 1377 cm-1 and *CO at 2068 cm-1) intermediates were observed for both Cu90Zn10 and Cu, indicating the co-activation of NO3 ⁻ and CO2 to produce N- and C-containing intermediates [52–54]. The peak at 1448 cm-1 is associated with the stretching vibration of the key CN bond, confirming the electrocatalytic CN coupling process [55–59]. Similar to the Raman results, the presence of the *NH2 and *CO peaks in ATR-SEIRAS again indicates that they are the primary nitrogen and carbon intermediates for the formation of urea. [60–64] In situ ATR-SEIRAS for Zn was also performed (Fig. S10), revealing peaks at 2345 cm⁻¹ and 1392 cm⁻¹ corresponding to CO2 and *OCO, respectively, indicating that CO2 is adsorbed and activated on the catalyst surface. The absence of CN peaks suggested limited selectivity for urea, aligning with the electrocatalytic findings. From in situ Raman and ATR-SEIRAS results, we also found some key differences between the Cu90Zn10 and Cu catalysts. In Raman spectra, the *CO (i.e., peaks at 364 cm-1 and 2073 cm⁻¹) and *NH2 adsorption peaks (i.e., peaks at 1550 cm⁻¹) on the Cu surface appears at relatively low overpotentials with stronger intensities. Similarly, in IR results, *NH2 and *NO2 - peaks display higher intensities on Cu than that on Cu90Zn10. As Cu was found to be more selective in producing CO and NH3 products (Fig. 2d), it is suggested that a stronger adsorption strength of *CO and *NH2 on Cu compared to Cu90Zn10 may result in difficulties in their CN coupling, thus leading to a relatively low urea production rate. This is also supported by the normalized CN peak intensities (Fig. S11), where the CN peak intensities on Cu90Zn10 are higher than that on Cu in the studied potential range. Together, as illustrated in Fig. 4 , our electrochemical analysis, along with in situ Raman and IR results, suggests that Cu surface is active for reducing CO2 and NO3 - to provide key intermediates *CO and *NH2 for CN coupling, and more importantly, the introduction of Zn facilitates the adsorption and activation of CO2 and reduces the adsorption strength of these two intermediates, thereby decreasing the formation barrier of *CONH2, and ultimately promoting the urea production. This contrasts with the findings of Meng et al. and Luo et al. [42,43], who reported that electron transfer from the Zn shell layer to the Cu core in the reaction of self-supported core-shell Cu@Zn nanowires could facilitate the formation of *CO and *NH2 intermediates, thereby enabling subsequent CN coupling. The latter prepared Zn/Cu hybrid catalysts using a spraying method to achieve a relay catalytic mechanism, in which *CO2NO2 is preferentially formed at the Zn site, while the Cu site facilitates the protonation of *CO2NH2 to *COOHNH2. Conclusion In this work, a series of homogeneous CuZn bimetallic catalysts were synthesized for electrosynthesis of urea from CO2 and nitrate. With an optimized ratio (i.e., Cu90Zn10), superior performance in urea synthesis compared to monometallic Cu and Zn catalysts was observed, showing a Faradaic efficiency of 40% at −0.6 V vs. RHE and a yield of up to 304.8 mmol h⁻¹ gcat⁻¹ at −0.9 V vs. RHE. In situ ATR-SEIRAS and Raman analysis revealed that *NH2, generated from NO3 - reduction, and *CO, from CO2 reduction, are key intermediates for CN coupling. By introducing Zn onto Cu, large amounts of CO2 are adsorbed on Zn sites, and the adsorption strength of *NH2 and *CO were weakened, thus promoting their coupling towards the formation of urea. Therefore, these findings indicate that the integration of metals capable of moderately reducing the reactivity of Cu in CO2RR and NO3RR could be a promising approach for the development of sophisticated Cu-based bimetallic catalysts aimed at the electrosynthesis of urea. Methods Materials synthesis Chemicals The reagents used in this study are as follows: analytical grade sodium citrate dihydrate (C6H5Na3O7·2H2O), analytical grade salicylic acid (C7H6O3), 99.0 % sodium nitroprusside (C5FeN6Na2O), 99.99 % potassium nitrate (KNO3), analytical grade ammonium chloride (NH4CI), analytical grade potassium nitrite (KNO2), analytical grade sulfonamide (C6H8N2O2S), analytical grade N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine hydrochloride (C12H16Cl2N2), and sodium hypochlorite solution (NaCIO), all of which were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Analytical grade copper chloride (II) dihydrate (CuCl2·2H2O), analytical grade zinc chloride (ZnCl2), isopropanol (C3H8O, ≥ 99.7%), and analytical grade phosphoric acid (H3PO4) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Urease, model U1500–20KU and Nafion (5wt.%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Synthesis of CuxZn1-x (x = 25, 51, 66, 81, 90) Initially, 0.2 g of CuCl2·2H2O and 0.04 g of ZnCl2 were dissolved in 30 ml of deionized water to obtain a mixed salt solution. Subsequently, 30 ml of 0.1 M NaBH4 was slowly added at a rate of 4.5 ml min-1 using a peristaltic pump to obtain a precipitate mixture of Cu and Zn. Following this, the mixture of Cu and Zn was washed with deionized water and centrifuged three times. Then, 5 ml of water was added to the mixture of Cu and Zn, and the mixture was rapidly frozen using liquid nitrogen until solidified, followed by freeze-drying at −45 °C for 48 h to obtain Cu90Zn10. The synthesis steps of CuxZn1-x (x = 25, 51, 66, 81) are identical to those of Cu90Zn10, except that the amounts of CuCl2·2H2O and ZnCl2 are 0.05 g and 0.16 g; 0.1 g and 0.12 g; 0.13 g and 0.1 g; and 0.15 g and 0.08 g, respectively. Synthesis of Cu and Zn Cu and Zn were synthesized using the same procedure, except that 0.26 g of CuCl2·2H2O and 0.2 g of ZnCl2 were used as the metal precursors, respectively. Materials characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA) of wavelength 0.154 nm. The morphology of the as-prepared samples was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi SU1510) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-F200, JEOL Ltd.). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were utilized to analyze the chemical compositions (XPS, Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi). The absorbance data of the spectrophotometer were acquired using a Beijing Purkinje TU-1950. Electrochemical measurements All electrochemical characterizations were conducted using a CHI 660E workstation integrated with a three-electrode configuration within a two-compartment cell, which was divided by a Nafion 117 membrane. The catalyst loading on the carbon paper served as the working electrode, while the Pt and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl solution) served as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. For the preparation of catalyst ink, 2 mg of catalyst was dispersed in a mixed solution of isopropanol (960 μL) and 5 wt% Nafion (40 μL). After ultrasonic treatment for 0.5 h, a homogeneous ink was formed, and 50 μL of the catalyst ink was drop-cast onto the carbon paper with a geometric area of 1 × 0.5 cm2, resulting in a catalyst loading of 0.2 mg cm2. For the electrocatalytic synthesis of urea, the electrolyte was initially purged with CO2 (purity: 99.999%, flow rate: 100 sccm) for 0.5 h to achieve CO2 saturation. The flow rate was then adjusted to 25 sccm, and the continuous feeding of CO2 was maintained during the electrochemical test. Potentiostatic tests were performed at potentials of −0.4, −0.5, −0.6, −0.7, −0.8, and −0.9 V vs. RHE. The cathode electrolyte was then extracted for further analysis. The constant-potential electrolysis experiments were repeated three times, and the results presented were the average values. All applied potentials in this work have been converted to the RHE scale: E ( V s . R H E ) = E ( V s . A g / A g C l ) + 0.0591 × P H + 0.197 . Determination of H2 and CO The gaseous products were determined by gas chromatography (GC) using a GC9790II. A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was employed to quantify H2, while a flame ionization detector (FID) equipped with a methanizer was used to quantify CO. Determination of NH3 Ammonia (NH3) concentration was determined using the indophenol blue method. Typically, a specific volume of electrolyte was extracted from the reaction cell and diluted to 2 mL. Then, 2 mL of 1 M NaOH solution containing sodium citrate (5 wt.%) and salicylic acid (5 wt.%) and 1 mL of freshly prepared 0.05 M NaClO were added to the electrolyte. Finally, 0.2 mL of 1 wt.% sodium nitroferricyanide solution was added, and the mixtures were stored at room temperature for 2 h. The resulting solution was analyzed using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer. The absorbance at ∼658 nm was recorded to quantify the concentration of NH3. To quantify the amount of NH3, a calibration curve was established using standard NH4Cl solution. Determination of NO2 − A specific colorimetric reagent for NO2 − quantification was prepared by combining 0.25 g of N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride, 4.0 g of sulfonamide, and 10 mL of phosphoric acid with 50 mL of deionized water. In a typical colorimetric test, the postelectrolysis electrolyte was diluted to 5 mL, and then 0.1 mL of the color reagent was added and shaken to achieve a homogeneous solution. After 20 min at room temperature, the UV–Vis absorbance at ∼536 nm was measured. The amount of NO2 − was quantified using a calibration curve of KNO2 solutions. Determination of urea The concentration of urea was determined by urease-mediated decomposition. This method is based on the production of ammonia from urea decomposition, which quantifies the change in ammonia concentration before and after the reaction. A 1.8 mL electrolyte containing urea underwent hydrolysis using 0.2 mL of urease (10 mg mL-1) for 1 hour at 37 °C. The molar concentrations of ammonia before and after the decomposition experiment were recorded as mb and ma, respectively. Since 1 mole of urea can be decomposed into 1 mole of CO2 and 2 moles of NH3, the moles of produced urea (murea) can be calculated using the equation: m u r e a = ( m a − m b ) / 2 Calculation of faradaic efficiency and yield rate The Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of urea was calculated using the following equation: F E ( % ) = ( 16 × V × c × F ) / ( 60.06 × Q ) × 100 % The yield rate of urea was determined using the following equation: Y i e l d r a t e = ( c × V ) / ( m c a t × t ) where V is the electrolyte volume, c is the concentration of urea, F is the Faraday constant, Q is the electric quantity, mcat is the mass loading of the catalyst, and t is the electrolysis time.

        "dc:description": "Urea electrosynthesis plays a vital role in the nitrogen cycle, promoting carbon neutrality while also being energy-efficient. However, the complexities involved in the simultaneous of carbon and nitrogen-containing species significantly hinder the selectivity and yield of urea. In this study, we report a CuZn bimetallic catalyst that is capable of converting CO2 and NO3 ⁻ into urea, with a maximum Faraday efficiency of 40% at -0.6 V vs. RHE, alongside an impressive urea yield rate of 304.8 mmol h⁻¹ gcat ⁻¹ at -0.9 V vs. RHE, surpassing the performance of both monometallic Cu and Zn catalysts. In situ spectroscopic analysis demonstrates that the Cu sites within CuZn facilitates the adsorption and activation of CO2 and NO3 ⁻, while Zn sites additionally facilitate CO2 adsorption and reduces the adsorption strength of *CO and *NH2 on the catalyst surface, collectively promoting the formation of *CONH2 as a key intermediate in urea synthesis. This study highlights the unique role of zinc in urea synthesis, offers new insights into optimizing the performance of copper-zinc catalysts, and serves as a valuable reference for future research on the role of zinc in urea synthesis.",
