Graphical abstract The core-shell VP-VO heterostructure, designed to balance the potentially excessive adsorption capacity of the VP core with the strong catalytic activity of the VO shell, has been successfully developed for the efficient adsorption and catalysis of polysulfides in Li-S batteries. This optimized interaction has enabled the Li-S pouch cell to achieve a high initial energy density of 468 Wh kg−1. 1 Introduction Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are broadly considered as an outstanding candidate for the future sustainable energy storage pathway due to their high theoretical capacity, high energy density, and low cost [1,2]. However, their practical deployment has been hindered by the sluggish 16-electron conversion process and shuttle of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), which result in the loss of active sulfur species [3,4]. The electrochemical conversion process involving polysulfides is multifaceted and includes several steps such as adsorption (where the polysulfides adhere to the electrode surface) and catalysis (where the polysulfides are converted to other species). Achieving efficient and stable performance in Li-S batteries requires a catalyst that can effectively perform both of these functions simultaneously. Traditional catalysts often struggle to meet these demands because they may excel at one function—either adsorbing polysulfides or catalyzing their conversion—but not both. This limitation can lead to issues such as the “shuttle effect”, where polysulfides dissolve and diffuse between the anode and cathode, causing a loss in active material and capacity fade over time. To address the shuttle effect in multi-electron sulfur conversion, it is necessary to fulfill the dual requirements of adsorption and catalysis at the sulfur cathode [5,6]. The excellent adsorption capabilities of the catalyst can effectively anchor LiPSs, while its catalytic properties facilitate the rapid conversion of these LiPSs. Polar transition metal compounds such as transition metal carbides [7], nitrides [8], oxides [9], and phosphides [10] have been investigated as polar catalysts due to their relatively strong chemical adsorption capability for polysulfides and faster sulfur catalytic conversion ability compared to traditional carbon hosts. Among these metal compounds, vanadium-based compounds with diverse oxidation states and strong interactions with LiPSs have attracted much attention [11]. Xiao et al. [12] synthesized the VO x @C yolk-shell nanospheres, which were used as a regenerative polysulfide-scavenging layer to inhibit the shuttle of LiPSs. Additionally, a defective VS2 electrocatalyst can be used as a lithium-transfer bridge to accelerate the LiPSs conversion process and improve the overall capacity [13]. It has been difficult to satisfy the adsorption and catalytic requirements at the same time for a conventional single-phase transition metal compound, while heterogeneous catalysts can simultaneously achieve dual functions in a simple way [14,15]. Chen et al. reported a WO3− x -W3N4 heterojunction based catalyst, which showed both improved adsorption and catalytic capacity for S species in Li-S battery [16]. However, how to balance the relationship between adsorption and catalysis in a bifunctional heterostructure is a challenging task. From an adsorption process perspective, stronger adsorption is associated with faster electron transfer and kinetics, leading to better electrochemical performance [17,18]. However, from a typical catalytic point of view, excessive adsorption hinders the desorption of lithium polysulfide, thus slowing down the rate of electrochemical catalytic conversion process [19,20]. Therefore, designing bifunctional electrocatalysts that can harmonize the excessive adsorption and weak catalytic processes of lithium polysulfides in Li-S batteries is essential yet challenging. Herein, a novel core-shell VP-VO heterostructure dispersed on porous carbon (VP-VO/C), which can play a harmonious role between the high catalytic activity and suitable adsorption capacity, was designed. The introduction of the metal phosphide-metal oxide catalyst with a unique core-shell structure for lithium polysulfides redox has not been reported. Theoretical calculations confirmed that the core-shell VP-VO heterostructure have a more moderate adsorption of LiPSs than VP and excellent polysulfide conversion capability. In-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and in-situ Raman further investigated the catalytic mechanism of VP-VO/C for sulfur conversion. When VP-VO/C@S was used for Li-S batteries, the assembled coin cells had an initial specific discharge capacity of 1335.2 mA h g−1 at the 0.2 C of current density. Meanwhile, the VP-VO/C@S cathode also demonstrated excellent stability at high sulfur loading of 10 mg cm−2, and the assembled pouch cell with a high energy density of 468 Wh kg−1 demonstrated its practical application potential. 2 Results and discussion VP-VO/C was obtained by chelating vanadium ions with phosphorus-containing resins and further pyrolysis under N2/O2 atmosphere. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to analyze the phase composition and crystal structure of VP-VO/C (Fig. S1), where the characteristic peaks at 32.4°, 35.6°, 43.8°, and 57.9° correspond to the (100), (101), (102), and (110) crystal planes of VP (PDF#89-1907). The characteristic peaks at 38.3°, 44.5°, and 64.8° correlate with the (111), (200), and (220) crystal faces of VO (PDF#77-2173). Fig. 1 (a and b) reveals that the VP-VO heterostructure particles with an average size of about 80 nm are heavily loaded in a porous interconnected carbon framework. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Fig. 1(c) further exemplify the results obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), with a large number of particles uniformly distributed on the carbon layer. In the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 1d), two types of lattice stripes with lattice spacings of 2.062 and 2.031 nm can be observed, which belong to the (102) crystal plane of VP and the (200) crystal plane of VO, respectively. The scanning TEM (STEM) images of VP-VO/C and the corresponding elemental distribution maps show the presence and distribution of V, O, P, and C elements in Fig. 1(e). The aggregation of V, O, and P elements at the particles verifies the successful synthesis of VP-VO heterostructure particles, while the carbon element is uniformly distributed on the framework. The carbon framework, which has been broadly adopted for hosting the cathode of Li-S batteries, can not only prevent agglomeration of VP-VO nanoparticles but also improve the electronic conductivity at the cathode. What is more, the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy results demonstrate that the core is mainly composed of V and P elements and the shell consists mainly of V and O, which confirms the core-shell structure of VP-VO/C. EDX line scanning of an individual VP-VO/C particle in TEM is presented in Fig. 1(f), which confirms the spatial distribution of the elements of V, P, and O throughout the particle. Statistical elemental ratios were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) (see Supporting Information for details). For comparison, VP/C and VO/C were also prepared (Fig. S2); VP/C and VO/C share the same carbon framework as VP-VO/C does. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of VP-VO/C further demonstrated the presence of V, O, P, and C elements (Fig. S3). The high-resolution V 2p spectra show two peaks at binding energies of 517.4 and 524.8 eV, attributed to V 2p 3/2 and V 2p 1/2 respectively [21,22]. The O 1s spectra show an image that can be delineated into three parts at the binding energies of 530.1, 531.5, and 532.7 eV, which illustrate the presence of the V–O, C–O, and H–O bonds, respectively [23]. In order to verify the adsorption capacity of VP-VO/C on polysulfides, Li2S6 visualization adsorption experiments were carried out [24]. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), the colors of the solutions of VP-VO/C, VP/C, and VO/C decreased significantly after 3 h. Furthermore, VP/C showed the strongest adsorption capacity to polysulfides. Subsequently, the supernatant of the adsorbed solutions was analyzed and the concentration of Li2S6 was detected by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy [25]. The testing result (Fig. S4) suggests that the solutions of VP-VO/C and VP/C after Li2S6 adsorption show low absorbance, indicating that only a small amount of Li2S6 remains in the solutions, which is consistent with the results of the visualization adsorption experiments. EIS measurements were also used to monitor the transformation during the galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) process, as seen in Fig. 2(b) (Fig. S5). Before discharge (2.8 V), all batteries showed similar semicircular resistance. After discharging to 2.3 V, the interphase contact resistance (R int) of all batteries decreased significantly due to the conversion reaction of solid sulfur to soluble polysulfide and the subtraction of poorly conductive sulfur, which can effectively reduce the charge transfer barrier and promote redox kinetics [26,27]. During the discharge (2.1 to 1.9 V) process, the soluble polysulfide was gradually transformed into Li2S, which was deposited onto the surface of the sulfur carrier, and the impedance increased rapidly correspondingly. After the completion of the initial cycle, the impedance of all cells increased significantly [28,29]. The changes of charge transfer resistance (R ct) of VP-VO/C@S based cells are significantly smaller than those of VP/C@S and VO/C@S based cells, because VP-VO/C catalyzes the charge transfer in the LiPSs conversion process and promotes the uniform deposition of Li2S [30,31]. The Bode plot (Fig. S6) corresponds to the Nyquist plots in different frequency regions (Fig. 2b). All plots show a rising and then falling trend in the high frequency region, which is caused by the capacitive effect of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer in contact with the lithium metal anode [32,33]. In the mid-frequency region (from 1000 to 30 Hz, labeled with an orange background), the plots of the VP-VO/C@S-based cell show a unilateral decreasing trend, while the plots of the comparison cell show an increase followed by a decrease (from 30 to 5 Hz, labeled with a green background). In the comparison cell, the slow conversion reaction results in the accumulation of polysulfides on the cathode surface. As Li+ needs to pass through the passivation layer of these LiPSs to transfer charge, this leads to an increase in the Bode curve during the capacitance conformation [34,35]. However, the VP-VO/C@S assembled cell was able to mitigate the LiPSs accumulation due to the accelerated catalytic conversion. Moreover, the corresponding Bode plots of the VP-VO/C@S (Fig. 2c) electrodes exhibit superior symmetry to that of VP/C@S and VO/C@S (Fig. S7) during the discharge/charge process, indicating that the interfacial changes of the VP-VO/C@S electrodes are reversible [36]. To further investigate the sulfur transformation, in situ Raman spectra were obtained during the charge/discharge process (Fig. 2d). The Li2S8 peaks at 151, 256, and 470 cm−1 disappeared with the cell discharging, and reappeared during the subsequent charging, indicating a highly reversible process [37]. Meanwhile the disappearance of Li2S and Li2S4 during the charging process demonstrates an excellent catalytic performance of VP-VO/C. To further confirm the substance in the Li-S batteries after cycling, HRTEM observations of five-cycle VP-VO/C were carried out (Fig. 2e) and a new phase of V5S8 was observed. The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the selected region is shown in Fig. 2(f), which is attributed to the V5S8 (110) lattice plane. With the deepening of charge-discharge reaction, V5S8 was generated on the heterostructure surface. There are more than one lattice plane of VO in Fig. 2(e), and we can see that the distance of VO corresponds to the phase of VO (111) after FFT. The following theoretical calculation also demonstrates the potential for bonding between VP and VO and polysulfides. Lithium-ion diffusion rate is an important form factor that affects the electrochemical performance [4,38]. To characterize the Li+ ion diffusion properties based on the Randles-Sevcik equation, cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at various scan rates (0.1 to 0.5 mV s−1) were also recorded (Fig. 3 a and Fig. S8) [39]. Fig. 3(b and c) gives the plots of I p versus ʋ 0.5 and the corresponding linear fits for the two reduction peaks (Peak A and B) of different batteries, respectively. Evidently, the battery with VP-VO/C exhibits the highest Li+ ion diffusion coefficient (D Li +) value for all redox peaks compared to that of VP/C and VO/C, implying that the VP-VO/C is favorable to facilitate the Li+ ion diffusion and LiPSs conversion. To further confirm the excellent catalytic performance of VP-VO/C and VP-VO-V5S8, a three-electrode system was prepared by linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) using a counter, reference, and rotating disc electrodes. An “S-shaped” curve can be observed from the tests, since the catalyst operates under a purely heterogeneous catalysis mechanism. The LSV curves indicate that VP-VO-V5S8 and VP-VO/C electrodes exhibit higher reaction peak current with the lowest Tafel slope, further demonstrating the improved kinetics of LiPSs redox reactions (Fig. 3d and e) [19,40]. At the same time, we collected the samples with V5S8 for LSV testing, and as seen, it has better catalytic performance. Fig. 3(f) shows the CV curves of the symmetric cells within a voltage window between −0.8 and 0.8 V at the scan rates of 1–5 mV s−1. The good symmetry of the CV curves indicates the high reversibility of the redox reaction. The CV curves of the symmetric cell loaded with the VP-VO/C show the largest response current in the CV curve, indicating the faster conversion rate of the redox reaction than VO/C and VP/C (Fig. S9). In addition, Li2S nucleation deposition experiments were also carried out. As shown in Fig. 3(g–i), the electrode loaded with VP-VO/C exhibits the largest lithium sulfide deposition level (277.1 mA h gs −1) than that loaded with VO/C (147.1 mA h gs −1) and VP/C (257.3 mA h gs −1). Besides, the shortest response time (2438 s) also suggests its better catalytic performance for the oxidation of Li2S. To understand the mechanism of synergistic enhancement between catalysts and LiPSs at the atomic level, a series of theoretical calculations were studied with the density function theory (DFT) method [41]. The optimized LiPSs adsorption structures and energies are summarized in Fig. 4 (a and b) and Fig. S10. Subsequently, the crystal surfaces of VP (102) and VO (200) observed by TEM were selected as the adsorption surfaces. The HS-VP represents the heterostructure of VP in the core where the LiPSs were adsorbed on the VP surface. For the core-shell structure HS-VO, the VO was in the core and the LiPSs were adsorbed on the VO surface. The V–S bond is stable which shows the potential to form V5S8. As shown in Fig. 4(b), there is an obvious decrease in adsorption energy for the HS-VO, in comparison to individual VP and HS-VP. The construction of VO-VP core-shell structure has the most suitable adsorption energy for the VO shell, which can ensure the smooth desorption of polysulfide while ensuring the good adsorption capacity, thus guaranteeing the rapid conversion of polysulfides. The density of states (DOS) displayed in Fig. 4(c) further verifies the favorable conductivity of VP-VO and the presence of abundant electrons around the Fermi level during the electrochemical redox reactions, which shows faster electron transfer ability to promote the conversion rate of polysulfide [42]. To further explore the mechanism by which VP-VO catalyzes polysulfide conversion, the Gibbs free energies of the main reaction pathways involved in the reduction of the S species were calculated (Fig. 4d) and the energy difference was compared between each elementary step [43]. During the entire discharge process, the rate-limiting step has the largest positive Gibbs free energy among all steps. HS-VO has the lowest Gibbs energy during the transformation of solid sulfur to liquid sulfur, which confirms that the VO coated VP structure can promote the transformation of Li2S6 to Li2S. Therefore, it can be seen that the core-shell VP-VO heterostructure has the best catalytic activity among the samples being analysed. To verify the advantages of VP-VO/C, Li-S coin cells were assembled using VP-VO/C@S as cathode, and VP/C@S and VO/C@S were employed as controls. The sulfur content in the VP-VO/C@S cathode was 78.7 wt%, which was determined by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S11). Besides, the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and pore-size distribution information were explored (Fig. S12). The VP-VO/C has a large specific surface area (251 m2 g−1) and abundant mesopores, which are favorable for mitigating the volume expansion of the S cathode [44]. As shown in Fig. 5 (a), the initial discharge specific capacity of the cell assembled with VP-VO/C@S cathode at 0.2 C was 1335.2 mA h g−1. After 200 cycles, the specific capacity of 1224.4 mA h g−1 was still maintained, and the average decay rate per cycle was only 0.041%, which was better than that of VP/C@S (1250.9 mA h g−1, 0.112%) and VO/C@S (1143.4 mA h g−1, 0.174%). The VP-VO/C@S cells exhibited better rate performance than VP/C@S and VO/C@S cells (Fig. 5b). The discharge capacities of the VP-VO/C@S cell at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 C were 1523, 1360, 1135, 996, 864, and 693 mA h g−1, respectively. When the cycling rate was adjusted back to 0.2 C, the discharge specific capacity was recovered to 1170 mA h g−1, indicating that the VP-VO/C@S electrodes still had good reversibility after cycling at different rates. In addition, the corresponding galvanostatic charge-discharge profiles (Fig. 5c) with clear voltage plateaus at various current rates are identified though the voltage hysteresis gradually increasing with raising rate, implying the rapid redox kinetics of LiPSs [45,46]. At the same time, the VP-VO/C@S can still maintain an initial discharge specific capacity of 741 mA h g−1 under a high current of 5 C, and can stably cycle for 1000 cycles (Fig. 5d). The potential for practical application was also validated by batteries with high sulfur loadings of 5 and 10 mg cm−2, which exhibited initial discharge capacities of up to 6.47 and 9.79 mA h cm−2 at 0.2 C (Fig. 5e). Even at a high current rate at 0.5 and 1 C, the cell can still maintain good cycling stability with a sulfur loading of 5 mg cm−2 (Fig. S13). At the same time, the average decay rate per cycle was only 0.21% after 150 cycles, which is lower than that of other cathode materials under high load conditions (Table S1 and Fig. 5f) [47–54]. More importantly, the pouch cell assembled with VP-VO/C@S in Fig. 5(g) can also light up an light-emitting diode (LED) indicator array panel and demonstrate an excellent initial energy density of 468 Wh kg−1 (Fig. S14), showing an excellent practical application potential. Further performance enhancement could be achieved via fine-adjusting the ratio between VP and VO in VP-VO/C. The moderate adsorption performance of VP-VO/C successfully inhibits the shuttle of polysulfides, while the excellent catalytic performance promotes the rapid transformation of polysulfide which inhibits the production of “dead sulfur”, ensuring the stability and high capacity of Li-S batteries. 3 Conclusions In summary, we demonstrated a core-shell VP-VO heterostructure, which can achieve a fast polysulfide catalytic process and balance the excessive polysulfide adsorption capacity of VP, maintaining a suitable adsorption capacity. The polar VO shell can facilitate the conversion process of polysulfides and the VP core provides suitable adsorption ability to anchor polysulfides, thus significantly suppressing the polysulfide shuttling effect. The synergistic effect of the VP-VO heterostructure was demonstrated via different methods. In-situ EIS confirmed fast electron and ion transport. Additionally, catalytic experiments and DFT calculations showed that VP-VO/C accelerated the catalytic conversion kinetics of LiPSs significantly and effectively suppressed their shuttling phenomenon. The sulfurization was also detected, which revealed the generation of the V5S8 on the heterostructure surface. The batteries based on VP-VO/C@S cathode demonstrated an excellent initial discharge specific capacity (1335.2 mA h g−1) and good cycling stability (200 cycles, decay rate of 0.041%) at 0.2 C. Notably, the VP-VO/C@S cathode maintained excellent discharge performance, delivering an initial discharge capacity of 9.79 mA h cm−2 at a high sulfur loading level of 10 mg cm−2, The assembled pouch cells showcased an initial energy density of 468 Wh kg−1, indicating a high degree of feasibility for commercialization. The demonstration above confirms its potential benefits for Li-S batteries, which are applicable across various domains from portable electronics to electric vehicles.
