Tetra-n-hexylammonium salts of SiRu(H20)W,1 039 and SiRh(H,,O)W1 1039 showed higher catalytic activities than the corresponding Fe- and Co-substituted catalysts for the selective oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone. Although the Ru catalyst was possibly a mixture, it consisted mainly of SiRu(Hz0)W39 and gave reproducible catalytic performance for repeated preparations. The initial rates were approximately proportional to the concentrations of cyclohexane, TBHP and the catalyst. Although the rate decreased with the consumption of TBHP, the initial rate was resumed by the addition of TBHP, indicating the absence of the deterioration of catalytic activity. Similarly alcohols and ketones were selectively formed from n-decane and ethylbenzene. Keywords: Alkane oxidation: Heteropoly catalysts; Rhodium; Ruthenium 1. Introduction Heteropoly compounds are well-known as efficient catalysts for acid and oxidation catalyses (see, e.g., Ref. [1]). It is possible to control their catalytic properties by changing their addenda atoms, heteroatoms, counter cations, and polyanion structures. Among different kinds of heteropoly compounds, those having so-called `Keggin-type Corresponding author. Catalysis by Heteropoly Compounds. 30.

P11 S1381-1169(96)00314-7 polyanions' have mostly been used for catalysts due to their thermal and chemical stability, and the high capability for the modification of the constituting elements. In this study, the Keggin-type heteropoly catalysts substituted at the addenda atoms were used for alkane oxidation in homogeneous system. When transition metals are added to the solution of lacunary Keggin compounds under appropriate conditions, the metal ions are `trapped' at the hole in the polyanion, and `substituted Keggin-type' compounds are formed (Fig. 1) [2]. There have been several reports on oxidation reactions of alkanes catalyzed by mono- or trisubstituted heteropoly compounds with tungsten as addenda atoms, [XM(H 2 o)W, 2 _ X 040 _ X ]\" - 162 Y.

Here is reported the performance and kinetic behavior of oxidation of cyclohexane, n-decane and ethylbenzene with t-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) catalyzed by tetra-n-butyl- or tetra-n-hexylammonium salts of [SiM(L)W11039](8 n)- (M= Ru3+ and Rh3+, L = Hz0) and compared with those with Co\" and Fe 3+ for M\"+. 2. Experimental 2.1. Reagents The following commercially available reagents were used for the experiments without further purification: Sodium silicate solution (Nacalai, EP grade), sodium tungstate (Nacalai, GR), cobalt acetate (Wako, GR), ferric chloride (Kanto, GR), ruthenium chloride (hydrate) (Tanaka Kikinzoku, 99.9%), rhodium chloride (Tanaka Kikinzoku, 99.9%), cyclohexane (TCI, GR), t-buty1hydroperoxide (Nacalai, 30% aqueous solution), tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TCI, EP), tetra-n-hexylammonium bromide (Nacalai, EP), and 2,4-di-t-butyl-4-methl-phenol (TCI, GR). The other reagents were also commercially obtained. 2.2. Preparation of catalysts Heteropoly catalysts were prepared as in the literature [5,6] with a slight modification. The general methods adopted are as follows: K8S'W11039 - xH20 was prepared according to the method in Ref. [7], and recrystallized twice or three times from water. The amount of water of crystallization, x, was estimated to be 13 as in the literature [8]. Aqueous solutions of a slightly excess amount of chlorides of the above transition metals were added to an aqueous KgS'W11039 - xH20 solution at 50-90. In the case of cobalt, the solution was buffered at about pH 6 by adding potassium hydrogencarbonate. After stirring the solution at the same temperature for 30-60 min and cooling to room temperature, the solution was filtrated. An excess amount of KCl and then methanol were added to it, and the solution was kept in a refrigerator. Potassium salt was collected by using a suction filter. For Ru and Rh compounds a cation (K+) exchange-resin (Amberlite IR-120B) was used (repeatedly in most cases) before the addition of methanol in order to remove the cationic Ru or Rh species. The potassium salts obtained were dissolved into water, and catalysts were extracted by benzene or 1,2-dichloroethane solution containing slightly excess amount of tetra-n-butyl- or tetran-hexylammonium. Beilstein's method of the products was negative, so that Cl- is not present [9]. L is most probably H20. Catalysts obtained were characterized by IR with KBr pellets or on silicon wafers (Fig. 2 and see also Fig. 6). Since intense IR bands due to the Keggin structure were observed, the compounds used for catalysts are mainly (R4 N)8 _SiM(L)W11039] where R is C6H11, L is HZO and M\"+ is Fe`, C02 ', Ru 3+ or \"3+. The possibility of impurity as pointed out in the literature [ 10] cannot be excluded, as the IR data for the Ru catalyst agreed with that in the literature [6]. However, the ion-exchange performed additionally in the present preparation would have improved the purity, because we Y.

IR spectra of SiMW,,039 (M\"+ =Fe3+, C02+, Rh31 and assumed that cationic Rh or Ru species are the impurities to be carefully avoided for the present study. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the Rh and Ru catalysts prepared repeatedly gave reproducible catalytic performance. These catalysts are denoted by SiMW, ,039 hereafter. The yield of the Ru compound was 20-25%. 2.3. Catalytic reaction and analysis The benzene solutions of catalysts were dried by anhydrous magnesium sulfate and used for reaction. To the catalyst solution (catalyst 1-5 Amol in 20 ml solvent), 0.4-2 mmol of TBHP (4.1 M, 0.488 ml) and then 18.5 mmol of alkanes were added. A tetra-n-butylammonium salt was used for Co(II) catalyst because no reliable tetra-n-hexylammonium salt was obtained. As the tetra-n-butylammonium salt was not soluble in benzene, 1,2-dichloroethane was 163 used for solvent. All reactions were carried out at 333 K in an Ar-purged vial with shaking. Under these conditions, the oxidation of alkyl chains in the ammonium counterion may be possible. A small amount of white precipitates due to carboxylic acids were observed in some cases, but nothing was detected by GC analysis except for those compounds described in the text. Products were analyzed by an FID gas chromatograph (capillary column; Carbowax 20-M, 30 m) with increasing temperature (333-503 K). Before the GC analysis the remaining TBHP was decomposed by triphenylphosphine. The amount of TBHP remaining after the reaction was determined by the conventional iodometry. To 20 ml of acetic acid, 1 ml of saturated KI aqueous solution and then 0.5 ml of reaction solution were added. After the solution was left in the dark at room temperature for 30 min, 20 ml of degassed water was added and the solution was titrated with 0.004 N of Na_, S ~O c solution. 3. Results and discussion Typical results obtained for the oxidation of cyclohexane catalyzed by mixed addenda 12heteropolyanions, [SiMWll039]t8-\")- (M\"+= Fe 3+' C02 ', Ru3 + and Rh3 +), at 333 K are listed in Table 1. Products were cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone, and no other products were detected by GC analysis. Among the four catalysts, Rh and Ru catalysts showed higher conversions of TBHP and turnovers for the oxidation of cyclohexane than Fe and Co catalysts. In spite of the possibility that the Ru catalyst was a mixture [10], the Ru and Rh catalysts prepared repeatedly gave satisfactorily reproducible results to enable kinetic analysis. The turnover was highest for the Ru catalyst. The yield of cyclohexanone, a product oxidized to a deeper extent, was greatest for the Ru catalyst, the yield being in the order of Ru > Rh > Co ^ Fe. The turnovers for Fe and Co catalysts after 6 h 164 Y. Matsumoto et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 114 (1996) 161-168 are similar to those reported in the literature for the same catalysts [3]. Time courses of the reaction are shown in Fig. 3 for two different concentrations of the Ru catalyst. With the consumption of TBHP, both cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone were formed, where cyclohexanone tended to appear at the later stage of the reaction. The delayed production of cyclohexanone was more clearly observed when the reaction was slower, that is, for the lower concentrations of catalyst and for less active Fe and Co catalysts. The conversion of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone was also noted in the later stage of the cyclohexane oxidation (see, for example, the reaction after 2 h in Fig. 3B). These results indicate that cyclohexanone was formed mainly as a product of secondary reaction of cyclohexanol. OH o o - - (1) 0 To confirm this, the oxidation of cyclohexanol was carried out in a separate experiment, where the reaction conditions were the same as those for the runs shown in Fig. 3, except that the cyclohexanol was used in place of cyclohexane. The oxidation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone took place rapidly by the Ru catalyst. The rate was about 10 times greater than the oxidation of cyclohexane.

The small differences observed in this range are probably due to the different concentrations of the products.

SiRuW, 1039: 5 jimol, benzene: 20 ml, and reaction temperature: 333 K. was resumed by the addition of TBHP after the reaction stopped as shown in Fig. 5. The IR spectra for the other two catalysts before and after the reactions were similar. The reaction orders of the oxidation of cyclohexane catalyzed by SiRuW1,039 with respect to cyclohexane and TBHP are shown in Fig. 7. Here, the initial slopes of the plots as in Fig. 3 are plotted in the logarithmic scale against the concentration of cyclohexane and TBHP. The orders are l.lth in cyclohexane and 0.7th in TBHP, respectively. If the possible errors in determining the initial slopes are taken into account, these results indicate that the orders are approximately first-order with respect to cyclohexane and TBHP. Thus, the rate is expressed by - d [ cyclohexanel /d t = k[cyclohexane][TBHP][SiRuW110391 (2) In Fig. 8 the amounts of products are plotted against the amounts of TBHP consumed, for the case of the oxidation of cyclohexane with several concentrations of Ru catalyst. The slopes, that is, the amount of products divided by TBHP consumed, are the selectivities of TBHP utilization for cyclohexane oxidation. The slopes increased as the reaction proceeded.

Y Matsumoto et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 114 (1996) 161-168 cates that the TBHP decomposition during oxidation exhibits a reaction order higher than first-order in TBHP. A similar trend was observed for the Rh catalyst, while the slope tended to increase slightly with the catalyst concentration. The dependency shown in Fig. 8 is probably due to the decomposition reaction of TBHP, 2Bu00H -j OZ + 2BuOH, which becomes faster at higher concentrations. Therefore, the trends that the turnovers were higher for lower catalyst concentrations (Table 2) and that the yield was greater for lower concentrations of TBHP are probably due to the difference in the extent of TBHP consumption which was higher for higher catalyst concentrations. If the decomposition of TBHP produces 02, there is a possibility that the autoxidation utilizing Oz proceeds as reported by Arends et al. [11]. So we carried out the oxidation of cyclohexane with Ru catalyst in a stream of Ar gas. The data obtained under the Ar sweep conditions gave the identical results with those in the stationary Ar atmosphere. Therefore, the possibility of the autoxidation is excluded. However, a significant effect of a radical inhibitor, 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methyl phenol, observed in the case of the oxidation of cyclohex- Table 3 Oxidation of various alkanes by TBHP catalyzed by SiRuW, X039 167 50 100 zo 100 20 40 60 80 100 time r min Fig. 9.

The catalytic decomposition of TBHP in the absence of cyclohexane was also examined. The rate of the TBHP decomposition was greater in the absence of cyclohexane than in its presence. Cyclohexane suppresses the undesirable decomposition of TBHP to some extent.

Matsumoto et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 114 (1996) 161-168 Fig. 9, the time courses for SiRhW11039 are expressed by a first-order rate equation with respect to TBHP and the rate constants obtained from the slopes in Fig. 9 are proportional to the catalyst concentration. Thus, the following rate equation is derived for the decomposition of TBHP catalyzed by SiRhWj039 in the absence of cyclohexane, where k' is the rate constant: -d[TBHP] /dt = k'[TBHP] [SiRhW11039] (3) On the other hand, in the case of the Ru catalyst the initial rate of the TBHP decomposition in the absence of cyclohexane was 1.2th with respect to the catalyst concentration, while the time courses better fitted the second-order kinetics than first-order kinetics, and the rate constants obtained by the second-order kinetics showed 1.7th order dependency on the catalyst concentration. Thus, the reaction orders of TBHP decomposition with Ru catalyst in the absence of cyclohexane are not certain, while they are probably greater than one. The reason for the higher orders in the case of the Ru catalyst is not clear, but the high orders have been reported for the hydroperoxide decomposition catalyzed by cobalt and ruthenium compounds [12]. Table 3 shows the results obtained when the SiRuW11039 catalyst was applied to the oxidations of n-decane, ethylbenzene, and diphenylmethane. This catalyst exhibited significant activity also in these cases, particularly, in the selective oxidation at the benzyl position. The turnovers are in general similar to those of Ru phosphine complexes reported in the literature [13], although the present Ru catalyst tended to be more active for less bulky substrates. There are known reagents for the oxidation of C-H bond at the benzyl position [ 14,15]. However, in these cases a large amount of acetic acid or KOH and a high temperature are often required. With Ru catalysts the oxidation at benzyl posi- tion proceeds selectively under mild conditions.

Alkane oxidation with mixed addenda heteropoly catalysts containing Ru(III) and Rh(III) Youichi Matsumoto Masayuki Asami Masato Hashimoto 2 Makoto Misono ∗ Department of Applied Chemistry, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo, Tokyo 113, Japan ∗ Corresponding author. 2 Present address: Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Umeå University, S-901 87 Umeå, Sweden. Oxidation of alkanes, mainly of cyclohexane, with t-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) catalyzed by alkylammonium salts of mixed addenda heteropoly compounds having Keggin-type polyanions were studied in benzene solutions, with regard to the relative catalytic activity, reaction orders and the stability of catalysts. Tetra-n-hexylammonium salts of SiRu(H2O)W11O5− 39 and SiRh(H2O)W11O5− 39 showed higher catalytic activities than the corresponding Fe- and Co-substituted catalysts for the selective oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone. Although the Ru catalyst was possibly a mixture, it consisted mainly of SiRu(H2O)W11O5− 39 and gave reproducible catalytic performance for repeated preparations. The initial rates were approximately proportional to the concentrations of cyclohexane, TBHP and the catalyst. Although the rate decreased with the consumption of TBHP, the initial rate was resumed by the addition of TBHP, indicating the absence of the deterioration of catalytic activity. Similarly alcohols and ketones were selectively formed from n-decane and ethylbenzene.
