Graphical abstract A “green”, simple, technically and economically feasible synthesis of valuable ethylene carbonate from 2-chloroethanol and CO2 was developed using K2CO3 as a base, silica gel as a catalyst and under mild reaction conditions. The influence of reaction temperature, CO2 pressure, base and additives on conversion of 2-chloroethanol was studied. Keywords Ethylene carbonate Silica gel 2-Chloroethanol Carbon dioxide fixation Green synthesis 1 Introduction Ethylene carbonate is used as a polar solvent for polymeric compounds [1,2], a reaction medium for a variety of chemical processes [3,4], an extractant [5], a plasticizer [6], a blowing agent [7], a stabilizer for lubricating oils [8], a high permittivity component of electrolytes in lithium batteries [9], precursor of biodegradable polyethylene carbonate [10]. Ethylene carbonate is generally produced by reaction of inflammable and carcinogenic ethylene oxide with carbon dioxide at a high temperature and high pressure [11,12]. The thus obtained ethylene carbonate contains some ethylene glycol admixtures derived from its raw materials. Ethylene carbonate also contains a trace amount of water in addition to the above impurity. Interestingly, it is reported that ethylene carbonate having low diol content is more useful in the capacity of the electrolytic solvent. Still, it is necessary that impurities contained in ethylene carbonate should be avoided [13]. With CO2 levels increasing in the atmosphere, CO2 has become an interesting building block in organic synthesis because of its low cost. Therefore, efforts to utilize CO2 as a “green” reagent, rather than to consider it waste, continue to attract considerable attention [14]. Recently, it was reported that organic carbonates were successfully prepared from 1,2-halohydrins and CO2 (20 atm) in polyethylene glycol using K2CO3 at 50 ⁰C [15]. Hirose et al. succeeded in preparation of different five-membered carbonates from 1,2-halohydrins and CO2 using K2CO3 in good-to-high yields under very mild reaction conditions (30 ⁰C, 1 atm CO2) in dry DMF [16], but this solvent has a high boiling point, forms strong hydrogen bonds with reaction products and, moreover, is highly hydroscopic. In this study, we show that a cheap silica gel for column chromatography can efficiently promote conversion of 2-chloroethanol and CO2 to valuable ethylene carbonate. 2 Experimental part 2.1 Materials Silica gel (0.06-0.2 mm, 60 Å, Acros Organics), 2-chloroethanol (99+%), Na2CO3 (99+%), K2CO3 (99+%) are commercially available reagents (Acros Organics). CO2 (99.99 % purity) was purchased from Voessen. 2.2 Typical catalytic experiments The corresponding silica gel (25 mg), tetraalkylammonium halide 5 mg (if necessary, see in the Table 1 ), 2-chloroethanol (0.4 mL, 6 mmol) and base 6.6 mmol were introduced in a high pressure autoclave (10 mL), then CO2 (10 or 56 atm) was added to the vessel at ambient temperature. The autoclave was heated up to the desired temperature (5 min). The reaction proceeded at 110, 80 or 50 °C for necessary time. The reactor was cooled to room temperature in a water bath and the CO2 pressure was released. The reaction products were analyzed by NMR after extraction by CDCl3 (1.5 mL). Spectral characteristics of 2 are in accordance with literature data [15]. 3 Results and discussion The cyclization of 2-chloroethanol (1) with CO2 (56 atm) into ethylene carbonate (2) was first tested using silica gel as a catalyst and Na2CO3 as a base (Scheme 1 ). At 110 ⁰C, the conversion to the desired carbonate 2 was 75 % (Table 1, entry 1). The use of KOH or NaOH as a base proved to be less effective (Table 1, entries 2 and 3). Moreover, the addition of 2-chloroethanol to KOH immediately causes an intensive evolution of ethylene oxide, which makes the process enough dangerous [17]. In contrast, the loading of 2-chloroethanol to inorganic carbonates is absolutely safe. Addition of tetrabutylammonium bromide which practically always is used as a co-catalyst in the reaction of CO2 to form organic carbonates [14,18,19], resulted in an increase in the catalyst activity (Table 1, entry 4). In this case conversion reached 92 %. We also checked efficiency of other phase-transfer agents, such as N(Bu)4I, N(Bu)4Cl and N(Et)4Cl, with the result that the same conversion was observed (Table 1, entries 5–7). It should be noted that the reaction with silica gel or tetrabutylammonium bromide without Na2CO3 did not proceed at all (Table 1, entries 8,9). We also checked the reaction without addition of CO2 but no product was formed. Only 2-chloroethanol was detected in the reaction mixture according to 1H NMR. Bearing in mind the possible formation of oxirane (bp 10.4 ⁰C) in the reaction we have refrigerated the evolved gases by liquid nitrogen, but no liquid oxirane phase was observed. We noticed formation of a very small amount of a solid product which immediately turned gaseous after thawing without transformation into the intermediate liquid phase, which is typical for dry ice. A 1H NMR spectra of the condensed phase (5 ⁰C) dissolved in CDCl3 showed no signals of organic compounds; only traces of water were detected. We also checked the above reaction using K2CO3 as a base and N(Bu)4Br as an additive without adding silica gel. In this case 94 % conversion of 2-chloroethanol was obtained, but 41 % of ethylene glycol was formed in addition to the desired ethylene carbonate. This fact may be attributed to uncontrolled hydrolysis of 2-chloroethanol to ethylene glycol under alkaline conditions of the rather hygroscopic K2CO3. The use of silica gel solves the problem with the hygroscopic properties of the base due to a higher reaction rate. As reported earlier, the process is expected to proceed as shown in Scheme 2 but with a few exceptions [16]. Since the reaction of 2-chloroethanol with K2CO3 is unlikely to proceed and no CO2 evolved as the reaction product, we suppose that K2CO3 can reversibly interact with acidic Si−OH groups of silica gel to form a highly alkaline potassium silicate which can promote the process. It was shown recently that inorganic silicates have the capacity to absorb CO2 to form carbonates between room temperature and 130 ⁰C, and recoverability of silica gel is the key factor of catalytic process [20,21]. From the practical perspective of the reaction process, the eﬀ ;ect of CO2 pressure was investigated. Surprisingly, upon decreasing the CO2 pressure from 56 to 10 atm, a noticeable increase in reactivity was registered (Table 1, entry 10). The use of K2CO3 as a base also showed complete conversion (Table 1, entry 11) when the same reaction condition was tested. Probably, the increased solubility of 2-chloroethanol in the bulk of hot liquid CO2 (near-critical conditions) with liquid-liquid phase behavior reduces the reaction rate [22]. To evaluate effect of temperature on conversion using K2CO3 and Na2CO3 as bases, we studied the process at a lower (50 ⁰C) reaction temperature but the same CO2 pressure (10 atm) and prolonged time. In this case, we obtained the product 2 with a good conversion using K2CO3, while Na2CO3 showed a significantly lower reaction rate (Table 1, entries 12–15). It should be noted that N(Bu)4Br actually exerted no effect on conversion at this temperature. The reaction of 2-chloroethanol with CO2 at a higher reaction temperature (80 ⁰C) showed again that Na2CO3 gave a lower conversion to 2 compared to the more basic K2CO3 (Table 1, entries 16–19). Finally, it should be stressed that K2CO3 alone gives complete conversion of 2-chloroethanol to desired ethylene carbonate without any assistance from N(Bu)4Br, the latter can only contaminate the product. So, the process requires the use of easily available 2-chloroethanol, inexpensive K2CO3, CO2 at a sufficiently low pressure (10 atm), a moderate temperature (80 ⁰C), a pinch of silica gel for column chromatography as a catalyst and lasts for reasonable time (5 h). 4 Conclusions In summary, a “green”, simple, technically and economically feasible synthesis of valuable ethylene carbonate under mild reaction conditions was developed from 2-chloroethanol and CO2 using K2CO3 as a base and silica gel as a catalyst. Moreover, reuse of insoluble silica gel and possible utilization of the reaction potassium waste as mineral fertilizer make the process very ecologically and technology promising [16,23]. Testing the industrial application of the process is in progress. Author contributions Sergey E. Lyubimov: Wrote the paper. Anastasia A. Zvinchuk: Collected the data. Marina V.
