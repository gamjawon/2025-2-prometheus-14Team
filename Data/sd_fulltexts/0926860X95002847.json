The precursors, catalysts and reduced catalysts were characterized by means of infrared spec- troscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, temperature-programmed oxidation and BET surface measurements. The catalysts were also tested for methanol synthesis activity in a synthesis gas containing a small amount of carbon dioxide. When the precipitation was conducted at pH = 7.0, the precipitates mainly consisted of the malachite-like phase and the catalysts therefrom were more active. Precipitation at pH ~< 6 favored the formation of hydroxynitrate, which led to less active catalysts. Although the composition of the precursors obtained at pH = 7.0 and tempera- tures lower than 50 was the same as those at pH = 7.0 and T = 70, the activity of the catalysts was much lower. It was also found that the aging temperature was an important factor in determining the interdispersion and activity of the final catalysts. Although the effects of both the pH value and the temperature on activity of the catalysts can be ascribed to a similar reason, i.e., the different interdispersion of copper and zinc, it seems that the pH value exerts its effect through altering the phase composition of the precursors, while the temperature functions through the precipitation kinetics of the precursors with a same composition.

Li, T. lnui //Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 105-117 I. Introduction Oxide mixtures of copper and zinc (with or without aluminum) are effective catalysts for low-pressure methanol synthesis and low-temperature shift reaction [1]. A commonly used procedure in the preparation of the catalyst precursors is co-precipitating basic salts of the metals from their mixed nitrate solutions by addition of alkali. Since the precursor structure plays a unique role in determin- ing the interdispersion and the activity of the final catalysts, intensive efforts have been devoted to the preparation and characterization of the precursors, especially the effects of the cation ratio but the conclusions are considerably diverse. Klier et al. examined the copper-zinc binary precipitates derived by adding a sodium carbonate solution to solutions of mixed metal nitrates and claimed that at a copper-to-zinc atomic ratio of 30/70, the precursor was a single phase aurichalcite, (Cu0.3Zn0.7)5(CO3)2(OH)6, and at the other ratios, mixtures of hydrozincite, Zns(CO3)2(OH)6, rosasite, (Cu,Zn)2CO3(OH)2, and copper hydroxynitrate, Cu2(OH)3NO3, were obtained [2,3]. According to their results, a precursor with a copper-to-zinc ratio of 67/33 should contain 83% copper hydroxynitrate and 17% hydrozincite and the activity of the catalyst from this precursor was less than 1/3 of that of the catalyst from aurichalcite. However, the precipitate with the same composition prepared using the same agents by HSppener et al. was found to be a single-phase rosasite and the activity of the catalyst derived from this precursor was quite high [4]. According to their results of activity measurements, the most active catalyst consisted of 58 at.-% copper, 24 at.-% zinc and 18 at.-% aluminum. More recently, Sengupta et al. reported that the precursors ex-nitrate route with ammonium bicarbonate as a precipitant contained no copper hydroxynitrate at copper-to-zinc ratios from 1/9 to 3/1 [5]. Still, another fact can not be explained based on the results of Klier et al., i.e., many successful commercial catalysts have rather high copper-to-zinc ratios. For example, ICI: 58 at.-% copper, 27 at.-% zinc, 16 at.-% aluminum, 1 at.-% carbon; TopsCe: 60-52 at.-% copper, 25-21 at.-% zinc, 15-28 at.-% aluminum, 8-6 at.-% carbon [6]. This discrepancy can not be ascribed to the effects of alumina because as a structural promoter, alumina exerts little effect on the activity. Having compared the precipitation conditions used by the three groups of authors, we noticed that the pH values they used in the precipitation were quite different. The former group used an alkali-into-acid procedure, so the pH in the precipitation was gradually increased from 3 to between 6.8 and 7.0. The latter two groups performed the precipitation co-currently and therefore managed to keep the pH constant at 7.0, but they did not prepare precursors at the other pH values. So we expected that, besides the cation ratio, pH values may have a significant influence on the composition of the precursors and the activity of the final catalysts. Hence, we prepared a series of precursors with the same agents as those used by Klier et al. and HSppener et al. by co-current precipitation at J.-L. Li, T. Inui /Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 105-117 107 different pH levels (but for each precursor, they were constant) and character- ized them and their derivatives with infrared spectroscopy (IRS), X-ray diffrac- tion (XRD), differential thermal analysis (DTA), temperature-programmed oxi- dation (TPO), BET surface measurement and activity test. To be closer to the commercial catalysts, while maintaining the copper-to-zinc ratio at 2/1, we incorporated a small amount (10 at.-% of the total) of aluminum by adding its nitrate into the solution of the mixed nitrates before the precipitation. The effect of the temperature in the precipitation was also investigated because publications on this aspect have rarely been seen. 2. Experimental 2.1. Sample preparation Catalyst precursors were prepared by simultaneously dropping a mixed aqueous solution of copper, zinc and aluminum nitrates (total concentration was 1.0 mol/1) and an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate (1.0 mol/1) into a container with a small amount of deionized water. The suspension in the container was constantly stirred and kept at the desired pH level and temperature by adjusting the relative flow rate of the two liquids and the heating power. After precipitation, the suspension was kept at a given temperature for at least 0.5 h to perform the so called 'aging'. Then the precipitates were washed and dried at 80 for 12 h. The final stage of the calcination of the precursors carried out at 350 for 5 h in an air atmosphere resulted in the catalyst samples. For convenience, the precursors prepared at pH = 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 (while the precipitating and aging temperatures were the same and kept invariable at 70) are designated as PRs, PR6, PR7 and PR8, respectively, and the corresponding catalysts and reduced catalysts as CA5, CA6, CA7 and CA8 and R5, R6, R7 and R8, respectively. These samples were used in the pH-effect experiments. In the temperature-effect experiments, the precipitation was conducted in the similar way as in the pH-effect experiments except that the pH was kept at 7.0, while the temperature was changed (but for each precursor it was constant). Four catalyst samples represented by CA3o, CAso, CA7o and CA9o were derived in the same way as in the pH-effect experiments from the precursors PR3o, PRs0, PR7o and PR9o, respectively, for which the aging temperatures were the same as in the precipitation being 30, 50, 70 and 90, respectively. One more catalyst CA309o was also prepared, the precursor of which was obtained at a precipitation temperature of 30 and an aging temperature of 90. The reduced samples of CA30, CA so, CA70, CA90 and CA309o are designated as R30, Rso, R70, R90 and R3090, respectively. 108 J.-L. Li, T. Inui /Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 105-117 Two standard samples were also prepared: one was pure malachite (M), which was obtained by the similar procedure as in the preparation of PR7 except that the nitrate solution only contained copper nitrate. Another standard sample was pure copper hydroxynitrate (CHN). The preparation method was similar to that of M except that the pH value was kept at 4.0. 2.2. Sample characterization In the IRS analysis, 1 mg of the sample were mixed with 100 mg of potassium bromide. The mixture was ground to -500 mesh and then pelleted into a thin wafer. The spectra were recorded with an IR-43S type IR spectrome- ter. The X-ray powder diffraction patterns were recorded by using an XD-D1 X-ray powder diffractometer (Cu K c~ radiation) equipped with a DP-D1 com- puter system to perform automatic operation and data processing. A DTG-40 thermal analyzer, which can perform DTA and TG (thermal gravity) measurements simultaneously, was used to record the DTA and TG patterns of the precursors in a flow of 4% oxygen in nitrogen at a heating rate of 10/min. It was also used in the TPO and TG measurements of the catalysts in the same atmosphere as in DTA experiments. But the heating rate was 5/min. Before TPO measurements, the catalysts were reduced with 4% hydrogen in nitrogen at a heating rate of 10/min up to 500 from room temperature. The catalytic activity of the catalysts for methanol synthesis was evaluated in a pressurized fixed-bed flow reactor system at 20 bar, 225 and a space velocity of 7000 ml/g cat h. The catalyst particle sizes were within 1 + 0.3 mm. The composition of the gas feed was CO/CO2/H2 = 30.2/3.1/66.7 (vol.-%). Before the gas feed was led in, the catalyst was reduced with 1 vol.-% hydrogen in nitrogen at 245 and a space velocity of 7000 ml/g cat h for 3 h under atmospheric pressure. The heating rate from room temperature to 245 was 200/h. The BET surface area of the catalysts was measured by means of nitrogen adsorption with a continuous flow method using a gas chromatograph as a detector. The adsorption was carried out at the liquid nitrogen temperature and the desorption volume of nitrogen was used in the calculation of the surface area. Helium was used as the cartier gas. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Characterization of the standard samples The XRD patterns of the samples M and CHN are presented in Figs. 1 and 2 together with the comparison between the peak positions of the measured patterns and the stored JCPDS patterns given by the DP-D1 computer system.

XRD pattern of the standard sample M (a), its peak positions (b) and the peak assignment in JCPDS 10-399 for malachite (c). can be seen that the measured peak positions of the two samples are well consistent with those designated by the JCPDS card except for the absence of some weaker peaks in the pattern of CHN because of an incomplete crys- tallinity. Although some weaker peaks in the pattern of M were not assigned by the computer, they can be observed in the XRD pattern. The DTA patterns of both M and CHN exhibited a single peak nature (at 318 and 234, respectively) and the weight loss determined by TG analysis (28.72% for M and 33.71% for CHN) agreed well with the theoretical values (28.69% and 33.74% for M and CHN, respectively) calculated based on the formulas before and after heating and supposing that all malachite or copper hydroxynitrate decomposed to cupric oxide after heating. The characterization results of M and CHN by XRD, DTA and TG obviously show that the self-made standard were pure malachite (crystallization system of monoclinic and space group of P2 ~/A) and pure copper hydroxynitrate (crystalli- zation system of monoclinic and space group of P21/M). a 121. ). i I 19'.0 26'.0 i ii ] 33~. 0 40i. 0 20/degree Fig. 2.

The IR spectra of M and CHN were recorded. The spectrum of M (it will be shown later) is in good agreement with those reported in [7], [8] and [9]. The spectrum of copper hydroxynitrate is not available in the literature. As a main feature, the spectrum of our sample CHN exhibited three sharp bands at around 1420, 1385 and 1348 cm-1 as shown in Fig. 3. For the preparation of M and CHN, the only difference in the conditions and procedures was the pH value. Precipitation at pH = 7.0 resulted in pure mala- chite, while at pH = 4.0 pure copper hydroxynitrate was obtained. This fact indicates the important role of the precipitation pH value in determining the composition of the precipitates. The effect of the pH value in the precipitation can be explained by the following reaction model based on the mechanism proposed by Wasserman et al. [10] and applied to the present system: Cu2 2OH- ~ Cu(OH)2(s) 3Cu(OH)2(s) + Cu2+ 2NO; Cu(NO3)2\" 3Cu(OH)2(s) Cu(OH)2(s) + Cu2 CO2- ~ Cu2(OH)2fO3(s) Along with the decrease of the pH value, the concentration of proton in the suspension increased, so the concentration of carbonate ion decreased due to the shift of the following reaction towards right hand direction: H CO32- ~ HCO3 Therefore, the formation of malachite was suppressed and accordingly, the formation of copper hydroxynitrate was favored.

IR spectra of PR5, PR6, PR7, PRs and M. 3.2. Effect of precipitation pH Fig. 4 shows the IR spectra of the precursors prepared at different pH levels together with the IR spectrum of the standard sample M. The major feature of the IR spectrum of M is the doublet bands at around 1505 and 1390 cm-~ and the band at about 1045 cm-1 can be ascribed to the bending vibration of Cu-O-H because the only two identical bands in the IR spectra of M and CHN, the common group of which is OH, are 3500 cm-1 (due to the stretching vibration of OH) and 1045 cm- 1. It can be seen that the spectra of PR7 and PR8 are very similar to the standard spectrum of M except the weak absorption band at 1630 cm-~ which is ascribed to the bound water in the two samples. No characteristic bands of hydrozincite and hydroxynitrate are observed in any of the two samples. So it can be concluded that the major phase in PR7 and PR8 was the malachite-like phase. In addition to malachite, a great amount of hydroxynitrate was present in PR5 designated by the bands at 1420, 1385 and 1348 cm-1, in good agreement with the spectrum of CHN in Fig. 3. The fact that the IR spectrum of PR6 showed a much weaker band at 1385 cm-~ ascribed to hydroxynitrate indicated that PR6 only contained a small amount of hydroxynitrate. The XRD patterns of PR5 and PR7 (Those of PR6 and PR8 are almost the same as PR7 and therefore they are omitted) showed in Fig. 5 have confirmed the identification of the phase composition of PR5 derived by IRS. But in PR6, 112 J.-L. Li, T. lnui / Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 105-117 o v v i J i i I 5 10 20 30 40 20/degree Fig. 5. XRD patterns of PR5 and PR7.

PR7, and PR8, besides Cu,Zn-malachite (refer to JCPDS 10-399), a small amount of hydrotalcite-like phase, (Cu,Zn)6A12COa(OH)I6.4H20 (refer to JCPDS 14-191), was also present. This is consistent with the observation of Busetto et al. [11]. However, the content of the hydrotalcite-like phase was too low to be detected by the IRS measurement. The DTA patterns of PR5 and PR7 (those of PR6 and PR8 are very similar to PR7) are drawn in Fig. 6. For PR5, the endothermic peaks at 235 and 248 can be ascribed to copper hydroxynitrate with some zinc substitution for copper and the peak at 37 I to Cu,Zn-malachite.

This is in good agreement with the pattern of pure Cu, Zn-hydrotalcite reported by HSppener et al. [4]. The results on the composition of the precursors are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that for the precursors with the same cation ratio, the phase composition varies significantly with the precipitation pH value. The fact that lower precipitation pH levels favored the formation of hydrox- ynitrate and restrained the formation of malachite can be explained by the same reason discussed in the previous part of this section but the following formation reaction of Cu, Zn-malachite should be added to the reaction model. Cu(OH)2(s) + Zn2+ + CO2- ~ (Cu,Zn)2(OH)2CO3 The results of the activity test presented in Table 1 demonstrate that the activity and the selectivity to methanol of the catalysts increased with the increase of the precipitation pH and reached a maximum at pH = 7.0. Referring to the results of phase identification of the precursors, it can be concluded that the precursors with Cu,Zn-malachite as a main component led to more active and selective catalysts than those with hydroxynitrate as a main component. This fact was explained by Klier et al. with an epitaxial mechanism. They suggested that during calcination, the thermally more stable hydroxynitrate acts as a seed for crystallization of the nascent zinc oxide to grow as active hexagonal platelets rather than prism-like networks which have a larger surface area and a higher activity. This mechanism doesn't seem to operate in our case because Cu,Zn- malachite showed a higher thermal stability than hydroxynitrate as indicated by our DTA results combined with the other analytical methods. Furthermore, the endothermic peak of the DTA pattern of M was 84 higher than those of CHN. This is contradictory with the description of Klier et al., who claimed that copper hydroxynitrate decomposed at a maximum rate at 270 while Cu,Zn- 114 J.-L. Li, T.

The higher activity of the catalyst from Cu,Zn-malachite can be explained by the synergy between CuO and ZnO. It is reasonable to suppose that the interdispersion of CuO and ZnO in CA7 was more intimate than in CA5 because the former resulted mainly from an isomorphous substance Cu,Zn-malachite in which copper and zinc were in a greater interaction state. Upon calcination, ZnO and CuO had to segregate because of their different crystal structures and limited solubilities, forming a very fine interdispersion of CuO and ZnO. Upon reduction and reaction, more active sites could form. To get some useful information about the active sites for methanol synthesis reaction, we tried to use temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) but we failed because of the ambiguous and changeable results. While by means of TPO, clear and reproducible data were obtained. Fig. 7 shows the TPO patterns of R5, R6 and R7. According to the weight increment determined by TG, transformation of Cuto Cu2 took place in the three samples during the whole heating period. In each of the patterns, the low-temperature peak corresponded to the conversion of Cuto CuI and the high-temperature peak corresponded to the conversion of Cu~ + to Cu2 because the half weight increment fell between the two peaks. In J.-L. Li, T. lnui /Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 105-117 115 the TPO pattern of R7 there was one more peak between the low-temperature peak and the high-temperature peak. This middle peak spanned the transforma- tion of Cuin a hard oxidized state to CuI and CuI in a easily oxidized state to Cu2because it covered half the weight increment. According to Okamoto et al. [13], the easily oxidized state might be amorphous copper while the hard oxidized state might be crystallized copper. Along with the rising pH value, the low-temperature peak of the TPO pattern shifted towards lower temperature because of the strengthening interaction between copper and zinc oxide. This might result in the existence of more Cu~ in the catalysts during the reaction caused by the weak oxidation ability of the CO2-containing syngas and the high activity of the catalysts. So it might be concluded that CuI is an important factor for the activity of methanol synthesis. Furthermore, the fact that more intimate interaction of CuO and ZnO resulted in a more active catalyst provides an evidence for the synergy of Cu and Zn in the methanol synthesis reaction. 3.3. Effect of precipitation temperatures The IR spectra and XRD patterns of PR30 and PRso are very similar to those of PRTo, indicating that the precipitation temperature had hardly any effect on the phase composition of the precursors. The obvious differences are seen in the DTA patterns of the precursors and the TPO patterns of the reduced catalysts (Figs. 8 and 9). Along with the rising temperature, the third endothermic peak of the DTA patterns shifted towards higher temperatures and the first peak in the TPO patterns towards lower temperatures. Both trends probably originate from the same reason. That is, a higher temperature allows the precipitation to proceed under less oversaturated conditions and therefore at a lower rate. This resulted in a more uniform precipitate in which Cu and Zn were homogeneously 1 V3,8 I I I I 100 200 300 400 500 Temperature/~ Fig. 8. DTA patterns of PR3o, PRso and PRTo. 116 J.-L.

[12] that in the low zinc content region the endothermic peak of the DTA pattern of Cu,Zn-malachite shifted towards higher temperatures with the increase of zinc content. After calcination, an intimately dispersed CuO-ZnO mixture formed which exhibited lower-tem- perature peaks in the TPO patterns than the catalysts in which CuO and ZnO were poorly dispersed as obtained at lower precipitation temperatures. The activity results showed in Table 1 demonstrates that with the increase of the precipitation temperature, the catalyst activity and selectivity increased and gained its maximum at 70. This trend agrees well with the above discussion on the DTA and TPO results and again provides evidence for the active sites and the synergy of copper and zinc. The activity of CA309o was comparable with that of CA70 and CA9o and much higher than that of CA 30 and CA 50. This means that the aging temperature also plays an important role in the preparation of the precursor. That is to say, if the aging procedure is the same, the effect of the precipitation temperature will become less obvious because of the re-arrangement of the structure during the aging. In both pH- and temperature-effect experiments, the activity and the selectiv- ity to methanol of the catalysts exhibited a rather good correlation with the BET surface area of the catalysts (Table 1). This means that adequate conditions in J.-L. Li, T. lnui /Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 105-117 117 the precipitation can result in catalysts with large surface, fine interdispersion and high activity. In summary, to obtain a catalyst with a high activity for low-pressure methanol synthesis following the nitrate route at a high copper-to-zinc ratio, the precipitation should be carried out at pH = 7.0, T = 70, with an aging period of about 0.5 h and an aging temperature higher than 70. 4. Conclusions 1. In addition to the copper-to-zinc ratio, precipitation pH values and tempera- tures (including aging temperatures) also play important roles in determining the composition of the precursors and the activity and selectivity of the catalysts for low-pressure methanol synthesis. 2. To obtain an ideal composition of the precursors and a high activity and selectivity of the catalysts, the precipitation step should be performed at a constant pH of 7.0 and a temperature of 70. An aging period at a temperature higher than 70 is also necessary. 3. Although the effects of both the pH value and the temperature on the activity of the catalyst can be ascribed to the different interdispersion of copper and zinc, it seems that the pH value exerts its effect through altering the phase composition of the precursors, while the temperature does so through the precipitation kinetics of the precursors with same compositions. 4. Cu1+ finely dispersed with ZnO is important for methanol synthesis activity and the synergy between copper and zinc is vital. References [1] G.C. Chinchen, P.J. Denny, J.R. Jermings, M.S.
