Graphical abstract α-Aminonitriles were prepared in excellent yields and very short reaction times in the presence of silica supported H3PW12O40 (a heteropoly acid) as an environmentally friendly, inexpensive and reusable catalyst. The multicomponent Strecker reaction using trimethylsilyle cyanide or potassium cyanide was performed in very short reaction times and α-aminonitriles were prepared in excellent yields in the presence of a catalytic amount of silica supported dodecatungstophosphoric acid. The simple experimental and product isolation procedure combined with easy recovery and reusability of the catalyst are expected to contribute to the development of clean and environmentally friendly strategy for the synthesis of α-aminonitriles. Keywords Heterogeneous catalysts α-Aminonitriles Supported heteropoly acids Strecker reaction Multi component reactions (MCR) 1 Introduction α-Aminonitriles, often synthesized by Strecker reaction [1], are highly useful synthons for the synthesis of α-amino acids [2], nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as imidazoles and thiadiazoles [3a,b] and other biologically useful molecules such as saframycin A, a natural product with anti-tumour activity or phthalascidi, a synthetic analogue, exhibits even greater potency [3c]. The classical procedure involves the treatment of an aldehyde or a ketone with alkaline cyanides and salts of amines, and was discovered a century and a half ago [1]. The efficiency of the reaction has been increased by the use of catalysts, and reactive cyanide ion sources such as hydrogen cyanide, sodium or potassium cyanide, Bu3SnCN, bis(dialkylamino)cyanoboranes, diethylphosphorocyanidate, and trimethylsilyle cyanide (TMSCN) [4]. TMSCN is a safer, more effective, and more easily handled anion source compared to others [5]. A variety of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts have been used for α-aminonitrile synthesis [4–6]. Although these methods are valuable, many of these methods involve one or more disadvantages including the tedious isolation of pure α-aminonitriles from the reaction mixtures, extended reaction times, loading to the generation of a large amount of toxic waste, use of stoichiometric or relatively expensive reagents. Furthermore, many of these protocols are limited to aldehydes only, and many of used catalysts are deactivated or sometimes decomposed by amines. In order to circumvent some of the problems associated with these procedures and in continuation of our ongoing work on solid acid catalysts for developing new synthetic methodologies [7,8], herein, we introduce supported heteropoly acids (HPAs) as catalysts for synthesis of α-aminonitriles (Scheme 1 ). HPAs with Keggin structure are the most studied class within polyoxometalates, because they possess relatively high thermal stability [9] and acidity [10]. Supported HPAs are important for many applications, because bulk HPAs have low specific structure area (1–10m2/g). It is important to increase the surface area or even better to increase the number of accessible acid sites of the HPA. This can be achieved by dispersing the HPA on solid support with high surface area [11,12]. For heterogeneous systems, it is possible to control solid strength by supporting HPAs on different carriers [12]. An immobilization of HPAs on a number of porous supports such as silica, active carbon, montmorillonite K-10, zeolite, etc. [8,13] was therefore extensively studied. But SiO2, which is relatively inert towards HPAs, is the most often used [14]. 2 Experimental NMR Spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 200MHz NMR instrument. All chemical reagents and solvents were analytical grade and used without further purification purchased from Fluka and Aldrich. H3PW12O40 (PW), H3PMo12O40 (PMo) hydrate from Aldrich, Merck and Aerosil 300 silica from Degussa were used. Silica-supported PW (PW/SiO2) or PMo (PMo/SiO2) catalysts were prepared and characterized by a known procedure as previously reported [8]. 2.1 Typical procedure for the synthesis of α-aminonitriles A mixture of aldehyde (1mmol), amine (1.1mmol), TMSCN (1.5mmol) and PW/SiO2 (7mol%) in acetonitrile (3mL) was stirred at room temperature for an appropriate time (Table 3). After completion of the reaction, as indicated by TLC, the reaction mixture was filtered and washed with acetonitrile (2×10mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, concentrated in vacuo and purified by column chromatography on silica gel (ethyl acetate/n-hexane, 1:9) to afford pure α-aminonitrile. All products were identified by comparing of their spectral data with those of the authentic samples [4a,5a,d,g]. 3 Results and discussion Initially, the reaction of benzaldehyde, aniline and TMSCN in the presence of PW/SiO2 and PMo/SiO2 as catalysts were carried out in a one-pot condensation reaction. Usually, tungsten HPAs are preferred over molybdenum ones as acid catalysts because of their stronger acidity, higher thermal stability and low reducibilities [11] (Table 1 , entries 1 and 4). It is known, that HPAs strongly interact with supports at low loading levels, while the bulk properties of HPAs prevail at higher loading [11]. PW/SiO2 with different weight percent of PW was examined as evidenced in Table 1, entries 2–4, 40wt.% of PW/SiO2 shows the best result. To establish the optimal conditions, a set of experiments varying solvent and the amount of the catalyst were carried out (Table 1, entries 4–9). The use of just 7mol% of 40wt.% PW/SiO2 is sufficient to promote the reaction and no additives are required for this conversion. It is remarkable to note that no improvements in the reaction rates and yields were observed by increasing the amount of the catalyst from 7 to 12mol% and lesser amount (4mol%) also worked with longer reaction times (Table 1, entries 5 and 6). Different solvents were compared and acetonitrile was chosen. The others including benzene, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran showed lower yields (Table 1, entries 7–9). In comparison with other catalysts employed for the anilinocyanation of benzaldehyde, 40wt.% of PW/SiO2 showed more catalytic reactivity than others in term of reaction time, and yield of the product (Table 2 ). The reaction was extended to other substituted aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic aldehydes under the optimum conditions (Table 3 ). The method was equally effective for aromatic, benzylic, and both primary and secondary amines to produce corresponding α-aminonitriles in high to excellent yields. It is noteworthy that, only a few reports of Strecker reaction with ketones reported in the literature [4a–d], but ketones were coupled with different amines and TMSCN in a one-pot operation in the presence of PW/SiO2 at room temperature (Table 3, entries 17–20). Moreover the reaction conditions are mild enough to perform the reactions in the presence of acid sensitive substrates, such as furfuraldehyde and cinnamaldehyde without any decomposition or polymerization (Table 3, entries 11–14). Enolizable aldehyde such as decanal afforded the corresponding α-aminonitriles with excellent yield in very short reaction time (Table 3, entry 15). In general, the reactions are very fast and no undesired side product was isolated. Finally reactivity of the catalyst was checked with potassium cyanide as a cyanating agent in the same reaction conditions. In all cases the reaction afforded the corresponding α-aminonitriles in high to excellent yields with longer reaction times, but the reaction times were still better than those from other methods. The results shown in Table 2 clearly indicate the scope and generality of the reaction with respect to various aldehydes, amines and cyanating agents. In addition, PW/SiO2 was found to be reusable several times without loss of activity. Simply the catalyst should be filtered, washed with acetone, dried and reused. After reusing the catalyst for five times, the yield of α-aminonitrile produced from the reaction of benzaldehyde and aniline with TMSCN was 92% (Table 1, entries 10–13). 4 Conclusion The present procedure represents a clean, environmentally friendly, practical, and simple method with easy work-up. It is applicable to a wide scope of structural types, even for ketones, and produced corresponding α-aminonitriles in excellent yields in very short reaction times using low mole percent of the catalyst. Also supported H3PW12O40 is non-toxic, inexpensive, and reusable catalyst.

The simple experimental and product isolation procedure combined with easy recovery and reusability of the catalyst are expected to contribute to the development of clean and environmentally friendly strategy for the synthesis of α-aminonitriles.",
