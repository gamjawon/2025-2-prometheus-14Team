Bond *, Joop C. Slaa Department of Chemistry, Brunel University, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, UK Received I June 1994; accepted 6 December 1994 Abstract The HZ pressure dependence of rates of hydrogenolysis of ethane, propane and n-butane on Ru/A1203 catalysts differing in dispersion and type of pretreatment has been measured at a number of temperatures, and the results interpreted in terms of a mechanism involving adsorbed partially dehydrogenated intermediates CX, and modelled by the derived rate expression. The rate-limiting step is taken as the reaction of C.Hx with an adsorbed H atom. We thus obtain best-fit values of the rate constant k,, the HZ adsorption equilibrium constant K,,, an equilibrium constant for the dehydrogenation of the alkane KA, and of x, for each set of results. The shapes of the kinetic curves, and the constants that describe them, change markedly with dispersion, and with pretreatment: oxidation and low-temperature reduction (O/LTR), as well as causing some loss of dispersion, gives rise to other effects, ascribed to `morphological' factors, not seen when catalysts are reduced at high temperature (753 K). What is most striking is that differences in activity seem to be determined much more by the constants KA and Kf, than by the rate constant k,, which when expressed per Ru surface atom varies at most three-fold. In particular KH is much larger after the first high-temperature reduction (HTR 1) than after O/LTR. The true activation energy derived from the temperature-dependence of k, is about the same for each alkane ( =60 kJ mol-'), the enthalpy changes for HZ chemisorption are small and for alkane dehydrogenation they lie between 50 and 130 kJ mol'. The manner in which product selectivities vary with H2 pressure also depends on dispersion and pretreatment, the dominant factor being the strength of HZ chemisorption. Thus on a very highly dispersed catalyst for which KH is large, intermediate product selectivities are high because the high concentration of H atoms facilitates desorption of adsorbed species, and for this reason also selectivities scarcely respond to changes in HZ pressure. With the same catalyst after O/LTR, however, when KH is much decreased, selectivities respond sensitively to HZ pressure because the adsorption is weaker. It is then deduced that approximately two more H atoms are required to effect desorption of intermediates as a product alkane than to cause further CC bond breaking. Our results strongly suggest that structure-sensitivity in alkane hydrogenolysis is more the result of variations in chemisorption energetics, and their consequential effects on surface coverage, than of kinetic effects; this concept also accounts for dispersiondependent differences in the temperature-dependence of product selectivities previously reported.

Bond, Joop C. Slaa /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 98 (1995) 81-99 olysis of various Ru/A1203 catalysts, the preparation and characterization of which had already been described [ 2] ; this was done in terms of the rates and product selectivities they afforded in the reactions of propane and of n-butane with H2, both under standard conditions (433 K) and as a function of temperature. A constant 10:1 alkane:H2 ratio was used throughout. The principal conclusions were the following. (1) Following a first high-temperature reduction (HTR 1) , product selectivities at 433 K were quite different with the highly dispersed RuECl catalyst from those shown by the less well dispersed RuEC2 and RuEC3, and by RuECl after oxidation and lowtemperature reduction (O/LTR) and after a second high-temperature reduction (HTR2). Specifically RuECI after HTR1 gave very high ethane selectivities S2 which did not change quickly with temperature. (2) The O/LTR treatment applied to RuECl decreased its dispersion, but with all but one (RuNII) of the catalysts examined there was, after HTRI and O/LTR, a smooth variation of TOF with dispersion as measured by H2 chemisorption, the TOF increasing as dispersion decreased. TOF values were in generally good agreement with those reported earlier [ 3 ] . (3) After HTR2, TOF's for a given dispersion were much lower, but product selectivities only little changed. (4) The O/LTR treatment even increased the rates shown by Ru powder; there are reports [4,5] of similar effects being observed with other metals. The purpose of the next phase of our work was to obtain a deeper understanding of the origin of the effects summarized above. We had been struck by the marked effects obtained by varying H2 pressure on hydrogenolysis rates obtained over Pt catalysts [ 6,7 ] , and indeed had explored the consequences of changing reactant pressures on rates given by EUROPT-3 and -4 [ 8 ] . We therefore commenced a systematic study of the kinetics of hydrogenolysis of ethane, propane and nbutane on the Ru/A1203 coded RuECI [2] following each of the three pretreatments, and also on RuEC3 after HTR1 and O/LTR. We have subjected the rate measurements to kinetic analysis by rate equations proposed in the literature, our search for plausible expressions based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood formalism being greatly helped by the paper of Shang and Kenney [ 9 ] which appeared before our work started. Our motivation for undertaking this programme was as follows. It seemed to us that to base discussions of correlations between catalytic behaviour and physical structure or chemical composition of the catalyst simply on rates measured under a single set of experimental conditions was to ignore the compound nature of the rate of a heterogeneously-catalysed process, namely, that it can through use of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood methodology be factorized into a rate constant and a term containing the adsorption coefficients of the reactants. By determining the kinetics (by which we mean chiefly the manner in which the rate responds to H2 pressure variation) at a series of different temperatures, it is in theory possible to derive a true activation energy and the enthalpies of adsorption of the reactants if a simple Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism were obeyed. Such is not the case with alkane hydrogenolysis, which makes the task of kinetics analysis somewhat harder, but we believe our procedure, notwithstanding its limitations, allows a better appreciation of the underlying causes of particle size and surface morphology effects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real attempt that has been made to analyse size effects, or indeed any other means of modifying the essential catalytic properties of an element, with a view to seeing whether their origin lies in the kinetic or the thermodynamic parameters of the system. We have also measured the variation of product selectivities with H2 pressure at various temperatures, as this gives important insights into how pretreatment affects the state of the catalyst surface, and useful correlations with the temperature effects already reported [ 1 ] are established. As before, we have interpreted changes in selectivities in terms of the Kempling-Anderson reaction scheme [ 10] which treats the mechanism as a `rake' by which formation of all products is linked, rather than as independent reactions. The values of the Geoffrey C. Bond, Joop C. Slaa /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 98 (1995) 81-99 83 parameters obtained in this way also provide In the Kempling-Anderson treatment [ 10] the extremely clear and useful information about the hydrogenolysis of n-butane is regarded as taking reaction mechanism. Preliminary accounts of certain limited aspects of this programme, which was supported by the European Union under Contracts SCI `-CT91 0681, have already been published [ 11-13 ] . 2. Experimental The preparation and physical characterization of the catalysts used have already been described [ 2 ] , as have the standard pretreatments and the general modus operandi [ 1 ] . The following is a brief rum Reactions were conducted in an atmospheric-pressure flow system under micro processor control. For studying the dependence of rates and selectivities on partial pressure of reac tants, we have employed a reaction pulse method [ 8,11 ] by which for 1 min only the desired reac tion mixture (H2, alkane and NZ) was passed through the catalyst bed, at the end of which time a sample was extracted for analysis. Between reac tion periods the alkane flow was stopped, and the catalyst was cleansed by passing a high concen tration of HZ in NZ for 15 min. The HZ and NZ flows were then adjusted to those needed for the next reaction period, which was initiated 4 min later by switching the alkane flow into this mix ture. Highly consistent results could be obtained by this technique, although it did not always suc ceed in maintaining a constant level of activity, but only with samples reduced at high temperature did some correction for deactivation, as described below, prove necessary. HZ pressures were varied randomly, and checks at standard HZ:alkane ratios ( either 10:1 or 2.24:1) were carried out before and after measurements at the lower H2 pressures, where deactivation is most marked. When the HZ pressure was varied (0.021-0.81 atm), the alkane pressure was fixed at 0.071 atm, and when the n butane pressure was varied (0.032-0.27 atm) the Hz pressure was kept at 0.64 atm. Rates are expressed as mol alkane reacted per g catalyst per h. place through a chain of adsorbed intermediates C; containing j carbon atoms (j=1-4) together with a short-circuit from C4 to CZ to allow for fission of the central C-C bond. Selectivity to product Cj (j =# 4) is Sj, defined as Sj = 4cj1( c1 + 2c2 + 3c3 ) where cj defines the mol fraction of the species Cj in the products. A splitting factor F specifies the fraction of n-butane converted directly to ethane, and the proportion of the species Ci* (j =* 1) which desorbs ( rather than reacting further to C,*, ) is given by where kj is the rate constant for the relevant step. Modification of this scheme to deal with variable HZ pressure will be described below. Steady-state analysis of the reaction network provides equations which at low conversion have the form (SZ/TZ) +Sg= 1 +F T3-S3/(1 F) Evidently there are more unknowns than knowns, so we assume the value of TZ to be that of SZ in the reaction of propane under the same conditions. To this latter reaction the same basic procedure is applied, but the ethane selectivity SZ is then the only independent variable: to avoid confusion we shall denote this SZ as T2. 3. Results 3.1. Extents of deactivation and general remarks As noted above, in the case of n-butane hydrogenolysis some loss of activity was often observed during determinations of the effect of H2 pressure variation (which we will call for brevity's sake the HZ order).

Furthermore, the nature of colloidal metal species in photocatalytic reactions has not been investigated in detail. One problem with colloidal metal when used as a catalyst [2] is that the colloidal material usually requires a polymer reagent to be stable, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone or polyethylene glycol. In the absence of a polymer, colloidal particles easily aggregate and lose catalytic activity. However, polymer stabilizers often cover active sites on the surface which reduces catalytic activity [ 5 ] . We have been investigating the preparation of colloidal noble metals, that do not require the addition of polymer stabilizers, and the possibility of their use as nobel metal photo-related catalysts. Previously, systems consisting of colloidal noble metals and triplet sensitizers were found effective for photocatalysis in dehydrogenative dimerization of alcohol and cyclic ethers [ 6 ] .

On photocatalytic transfer hydrogenations of 1,5-COD, a deaerated solution of acetone (8.0 cm 3) , 2-propanol (32.0 cm3 ) and an adequate amount of Rh4(CO)12 were placed in a cylindrical quartz cell (50 mm diameter and 40 cm3 cell volume). The cell was irradiated by a 500 W high pressure Hg lamp (Ushio Inc.) through a UV-25 (Toshiba, 40% transmittance at 250 nm) optical cut-off filter. After five minutes irradiation, the color of the solution changed from pale rose-red to dark brown, as a result of the formation of colloidal species, and HZ gas evolution was observed. Formation of colloidal rhodium was confirmed by electronic spectra of reaction solution. Characteristic absorption of Rh4(CO)12 at 350 nm disappeared rapidly through irradiation, then a broad and structureless absorption band appeared. This absorption can be assigned to a scattering band of colloidal metals. It was estimated that photodecomposition of Rh4 (CO) 12 occurred at first and was followed by growth of colloidal particles. The colloidal dispersion was stable for several days after photoreaction even in absence of a polymer stabilizer. In order to complete transformation of carbonyl complex to colloidal species, 1,5-COD (0.3 cm3 ) was added to reaction solution after one hour's irradiation. Photo-transfer hydrogenation of 1,5COD proceeded smoothly to COE and then to COA. Although addition of 1,5-COD reduced the so 60 40 20 0 120 240 360 480 600 720 Irradiation time / min Fig. 1.

The typical result of the photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation of 1,5-COD are shown in Fig. 1 as the change of products composition by irradiation. Maximum selectivity 2 of COE was over 85%. Isomerized product 1,4-cyclooctadiene (1,4COD) was observed only in the early stage and its maximum selectivity was ca. 8.5%. By contrast, another isomerized product, 1,3-cyclooctadiene (1,3-COD), was not detected during the reaction. This may be attributed to the rapid hydrogenation of conjugated dime such as 1,3-COD compared with non-conjugated dime such as 1,5COD and 1,4-COD.

Based on a pseudo 1st order estimation of hydrogenation rate before consumption of 1,5-COD. 159 products between hydroxy radical and cyclooctanemoiety were observed in low yields as byproducts. As a result of the formation of by-products, the yield of COA was reduced to ca. 65-75% The transfer hydrogenation rate of 1,5-COD was much faster than that of COE. The ratio of the reaction rates between `1,5-COD to COE (just after addition of 1,5-COD)' and `COE to COA (after consumption of 1,5-COD)' was estimated from the reaction data based on a pseudo first order reaction. The ratio of the rates was ca. 4.8 in the photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation with rhodium colloid catalyst as shown in Fig. 1. By individual experiments, photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation of COE alone, the hydrogenation rate of COE was similar to the rate in the successive hydrogenation, which is shown in Fig. 1. The differences in the rates of both steps are attributable to the degree of affinity between olefins and the surface of the colloidal rhodium. Table 1 exhibits influences of the concentration of Rh4 ( CO ) , 2 on transfer hydrogenation and H,, evolution. Both rates decreased with increasing catalyst concentration. For example, when using 0.5 mg of Rh4(CO)12 ([Rh]=1.7X10-6 mol -1-') , the Hz evolution rate was 3.4 mmol h-' before addition of 1,5-COD, and hydrogenation rate of 1,5-COD was 0.70 mmol h-'. But when 2.0 mg was used ([Rh] -6.7 X 10-5 mol ~ 1-' ), these reaction rates were decreased to 3.1 and 0.43 mmol h-', respectively. These rates were further decreased to 0.70 and 0.1 mmol ~ h-', respectively when 6.0 mg was used ( [ Rh ] = 2.0 X 10-4 mol ~ 1-' ) . The TOF value 3 of 1,5-COD to COE was also decreased with increasing concentration, 259.8 h-', 40.4 h-' and 3.1 h-', respectively. The hydrogenation rate was found to be much lower than the rate of hydrogen evolution, especially when a high concentration of catalyst was used. Hydrogen transfer to COD and/or adsorption of olefins on the colloidal surface were effective at lower concentrations of colloidal catalyst. It is known that the catalytic properties of rhodium particles are affected by the degree of dispersion [ 8 ] . Thus, the increase of catalyst activity at lower concentrations is probably due to the higher degree of dispersion of the colloidal catalyst. As the degree of aggregation is strongly related to the concentration of precursor, we see that at lower concentrations, growth of particles is slower than that at high concentrations. Moreover, at lower concentrations, aggregation of particles is inhibited by diffusion. Because a large proportion of surface atoms is found in highly dispersed colloidal particles compared to aggregated ones, it is probable that these colloidal catalysts show higher specific activity at lower concentrations. Additionally, the life of intermediate radicals seems to be affected by diffusion factors in this reaction. 3 Tumoverfrequency: numberofmolecules (of 1,5-COD) hydrogenated per rhodium atom used per unit time. 84 Geoffrey C.

Orders of reaction in HZ for hydrogenolysis of n-butane (circles: BH35), propane (squares: PH26) and ethane (triangles: EH 1 a) over RuEC 1 after HTR 1 at 418 K. deactivation was most marked following the use of very low Hz pressures: the lowest value used was only 0.021 atm, corresponding to a Hz:nbutane ratio of 0.29. This pressure was only used in the penultimate measurement, and then not always: its effect is seen in Fig. 1. Extents of deactivation found in the n-butane reaction were in a relative sense not greatly affected by temperature, but what was very noticeable was the constancy of rates found after the O/LTR treatment at all temperatures ( less than 5%; see Fig. 1 for an example). Reasonably constant rates were also obtained with RuEC 1 after HTR2. Catalysts RuEC 1 and RuEC3 lost activity to about the same extent after HTR1 (see Fig. 1), so it appears that particle size is less important than the type of pretreatment in determining catalyst stability. Similar conclusions may be drawn from the measurements made with propane and with ethane, although extent of deactivation decreased with number of carbon atoms in the reactant, so that only a few standard measurements were needed with the smaller alkanes. Where necessary, measured rates were corrected for deactivation by assuming that the intrinsic activity (i.e. that found using the standard reactant ratio) determined the true rate for the samples taken since the previous standard measurement; that is to say, deactivation caused by using a low H2 pressure was reflected in that of the following standard sample. This procedure, while clearly not exact, generally led to `corrected' rates that showed minimal scatter ( see for example Fig. 2). Rates were normalised to the value observed in the centre of the series ( sample number 7 in the case of n-butane, see Fig. 1) . It was not usually necessary to make corrections for experiments using O/LTR-pretreated catalysts. A limited number of experiments were performed to determine orders in n-butane using RuEC 1 after each pretreatment: consistent results were found after O/LTR (Fig. 3), but somewhat scattered results were found after the high-temperature treatments. 3 1A z E 0 00 O 0 0 o-1 02 oa Butane pressure / atm Fig. 3.

Experience taught however that with a given sample at least three temperatures had to be used to give reliable and quantitative estimates of the effect of temperature on the constants of the chosen rate expression: for this reason series III was undertaken. Only two temperatures were used after each pretreatment in the cases of propane and ethane; orders in n-butane were investigated with RuECl only at 393 K.

The same propane results had to be used to derive true values of F and T3 from all the n-butane series, where the same or very similar temperatures were employed. As with most research, if we had been able to start again, know- ing what we knew at the end, we should have been able to avoid some of our mistakes; however, it should be appreciated that the work summarised in Tables 1-3 represents a very considerable investment in time and effort. Considerations of space determine that we cannot exhibit all our results in the form of rate vs. reactant pressure plots. In Figs. 2 to 5, we show examples to illustrate some of the principal trends produced by the variable factors employed: they demonstrate (i) a comparison of the HZ orders for the three alkanes at 418 K, using RuECl after HTR1 as catalyst (Fig. 2), (ii) the order in nbutane at 393 K using RuECl after O/LTR (Fig. 3 ) , ( iii ) the effect of temperature on the HZ order for the n-butane reaction, using RuEC 1 after HTR1 (Fig. 4), and (iv) the effect of the three pretreatments on the HZ order for the propane reaction at 398 K, using RuEC 1 ( Fig. 5 ) . The sets of results used in constructing these figures are specified by the codes. In every case, the curves shown are calculated from a theoretical rate expression, the use of which will be described shortly. These figures illustrate, in a way which values of standard deviations cannot, the degree of success achieved by our mathematical modelling; they also reveal whether limited success, where it occurs, is due to experimental scatter or to systematic deviation of the points from the calculated curve in a certain range of the controlled variable ( see for example Fig. 3 ) . The other sets of results of necessity have to be represented by tabulated values of the constants of the chosen kinetic expressions that best describe them. We are willing to supply to interested persons any of the detailed experimental results that are not shown. Some qualitative observations on the trends produced by the variables is in the order, to set the scene for the more quantitative treatment that follows. With RuECI after HTR1, on going from ethane to propane to n-butane the rate increases of all HZ pressures ( in contrast to the behaviour of Pt/A1203 at higher temperature [ 13] ) and the maximum moves to higher HZ pressure (Fig. 2). The same happens when the temperature used for n-butane hydrogenolysis is increased (Fig. 4). By Geoffrey C. Bond, Joop C. Slaa /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 98 (1995) 81-99 far the most marked and dramatic changes are however produced when the pretreatment applied to RuEC 1 is changed (Fig. 5; see also [ 11-13 ] ) . With propane as reactant, O/LTR greatly alters the form of the HZ order curve, in the sense of broadening the sharp peak found after HTR I : in consequence, rates following O/LTR are much the faster, buL only at HZ pressures exceeding about 0.04 atm. Similar changes are observed with ethane and with n-butane [ 11 ] . The HTR2 treatment leads to a substantial decrease in rate, as reported before [ 1 ] and the maximum rate shifts to lower pressure: the general shape of the curve is intermediate between those found after HTRl and after O / LTR. 3.3. Mathematical modelling The purpose of the exercise is to identify a plausible rate expression and then to evaluate the `best fit' constants of that expression of all sets of results, with the object of using them to obtain a better understanding of the mechanism of catalytic action. Unfortunately with the present system this is no easy or straightforward task. It is desirable at the outset to agree on certain ground rules defining the criteria by which a rate expression may be judged `plausible'. We suggest the following. (1) It must be derivable from a plausible mechanism, i.e. one that makes chemical sense and which allows the participation of all reasonable and relevant surface processes. (2) The constants obtained must have the expected signs, and their values must be sensible; moreover derived quantities such as true activation energies and adsorption enthalpies must pass the same test. (3) The expression must not be overly complex or contain too many disposable constants, otherwise one cannot fail to obtain gratifying fits with the experimental points. Several helpful reviews are available that survey kinetics and mechanisms of alkane hydrogenolysis [ 9,14] , although the emphasis is generally placed on the reaction of ethane. It is unnecessary to rehearse at length the results, arguments and conclusions that have been presented, especially 87 since the paper by Shang and Kenney [9] is quite recent: a brief summary will suffice. There is a general consensus that the reactant alkane, after dissociative chemisorption, has to lose further H atoms before it becomes reactive in hydrogenolysis; this being accepted, one function of the analysis is to determine what this number is. One supposes that the formation of one or more multiple carbon-metal bonds adjacent to the bond to be broken is necessary in order to strain or activate it sufficiently, although this point is rarely discussed, and never quantitatively. An alternative hypothesis [ 15 ] supposes that the rate-limiting step is the initial reaction of gaseous alkane with a chemisorbed H atom, but although the consequential rate expression has been developed it does not appear to have found much favour, and we shall continue for the moment to employ an equation based on classical dehydrogenated intermediates. Mechanisms based on such intermediates however permit a number of variations: these derive from considerations such as whether adsorption equilibrium is set up with the alkane or not, whether HZ adsorption is competitive with the alkane or not, what form of hydrogen (atomic or molecular) is involved, whether vacant surface `sites' are needed, and how many `sites' are required to bond the dehydrogenated intermediate. The way in which the answers to these questions are built into the assumed mechanism then determines the form of the kinetic expression. The simplest form is of course the power rate law, which in spite of its obvious limitation of not showing a maximum as the HZ pressure is varied still continues to be used in theoretical analyses [16]. One of the most astonishing features that we have observed in modelling alkane hydrogenolysis is close similarity between curves calculated from seemingly quite different rate expressions: this is seen in the work of Shang and Kenney [ 9 ] and is confirmed by our own experience [ 8 ] . This even extends to the power rate law, where in the region of HZ inhibition extremely good log-log plots are obtained (Fig. 6). This means that, with the occasional exception [ 9 ] , it 88 Geoffrey C. Bond, Joop C.

Note: in the tables and text, the extent of dehydrogenation is defined by a, the number of molecules of H2 evolved in step 2, so that a = (n -x) /2. is impossible to eliminate a rate expression on the grounds that it does not and cannot fit the results over an extended range. Discrimination between alternatives then has to be performed with the aid of the ancillary criteria listed above. It is also pertinent to note that although the same constants may appear in differently formulated rate expressions, their best-fit values may vary enormously: thus in Table 3 of Shang and Kenney's paper [ 9 ] the variability of KE, the adsorption equilibrium constant for ethane, over four equations is a factor of 2 X 10' while even between the two quite closely similar equations, ES4 and ES5, it varies by 2 X 106 for KE and 7 X 104 for KH, the H2 adsorption equilibrium constant. This great variability should however assist in the process of discrimination between alternatives. One of the proposed criteria for acceptability was the number of disposable constants in the rate expression. We should however exclude kt, the rate-constant for the slow step, as this only acts as a linear scaling factor. On this basis quite the most satisfactory expression is that coded as ES2 [9], namely, r = k1KAPAPH / (KAPA + Pal) (ES2) in which only KA (the adsorption equilibrium constant for alkane) and a (the number of H2 molecules lost by the alkane) are disposable. This equation can provide good fits to experimental results [ 8,9 ] : however it fails the test of acceptability by not embracing the possibility of dissociative H2 adsorption (there is no KH in the equation). Having carefully considered all options, we have decided to use the equation ES5B of Shang and Kenney [9]; this had been earlier devised and used by Kristyan and Szamosi [ 17], and is based on the classical dehydrogenated intermediate. The formulation of the mechanism on which it is based is shown in Scheme 1, and the equation takes the form ktKAPA(KHPH) (n-x)12 [KAPA+(KHPH)(n x)/2+ (KHpH)(n+t-x)12]2 r= (ESSB) where x is the number of H atoms remaining on the hydrocarbon species and n the number in the reactant. There are thus three disposable constants. Our results have been analysed by use of this equation, and little purpose would be served by tedious recitation of the values of constants which alternative equations produce. It is worth being quite clear about the basic (often unspoken) assumptions underlying this and analogous rate equations. (i) It is implied that there is one and only one reactive intermediate, that is, a single value of x (or a) applies at all H2 pressures, although of course positional isomers Reactivity: Zero Small Large Small Zero Number of H atoms: 2n + 2 2n+ 1 2n 2n- 1 C2 species C2H6 CH3CH2 CH2CH2 CHCH2 C3 species CA CH3CH2CH2 CHjCHCH2 CH2CHCH2 CQ species n-C41110 CH3CH2CH2CH2 CH3CHCH2CH2 CH3CHCHCH2 Scheme 2.

Slaa /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 98 (1995) 81-99 are allowed. This assumption is sometimes omitted, and different species are taken as the reactive intermediate in different zones of HZ pressure [ 18], although why in this case CA and CA were chosen and CZH4 ignored is by no means clear. The assumption if valid would mean that the analysis should yield only integral values of x (O < x < 2n + 2) ; presently we will have to cope with the significance of non-integral values. (ii) It is assumed that the same area of active surface is available under all conditions. This assumption is almost certainly invalid, except possibly for O/ LTR treated catalysts, and for the others it becomes less valid as the size of the alkane is increased. The situation that one might envisage is outlined in Scheme 2. If we suppose for the sake of argument that the only reactive species are CZ 1, then their surface concentrations are more or less adequately defined by the equilibrium shown in Scheme 1. What is not however specified is how much of the adsorbed alkane is in the form of more highly dehydrogenated species, which are assumed to be unreactive. Quantitative provision for these extra equilibria would necessitate introduction of more constants into the equation, with ensuing loss of significance. To say the simpler, the better, is good advice, but it is unrealistic when the system is inherently complex: this is the essential dilemma of mathematical modelling. Qualitatively it is clear that the more carbon atoms in the alkane, the greater are the possibilities for forming single or multiple carbon-metal bonds, and hence the more firmly anchored the species can become (Scheme 2). Clearly also there are circumstances in which it is virtually impossible to avoid forming overdehydrogenated species, even during the short reaction period, if deactivation is due to their occurrence. 3.4. Results of mathematical modelling Recognising the limitations of the procedure we have adopted, we nevertheless proceed to record in Tables 1 to 3 the best-fit values of the constants of the rate expression ES5B: we do not quote 89 standard deviations, as their values depend on the range of rates that the measurements cover, but they can be provided on request. Optimisation was performed using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm [ 19] ; a more detailed account of how this was done will be submitted for publication separately. Briefly for each set of results the value of x was altered until the standard deviation was minimised; the values of all constants were then noted. One of the lessons learned at an early stage was the usefulness of having results to the left of the maximum, in addition to those on the right, where the majority lay. With some systems (e.g. CZH6/ RuECI-HTR1; C3Hg/RuEC3-HTR1; n-C4H,o/ RuECI-HTRl series 1) the HZ pressure for the maximum rate was either inaccessibly low or inadvertently not attained: constants from these sets are therefore less reliable than others, and they are either not quoted or are italicised in the Tables. They are expressed to not more than three significant figures. The most elastic of the disposable constants is undoubtedly x, the minimum in plots of standard deviation vs. x being quite shallow: changing x by 0.1 makes little difference to the quality of the fit. To aid further discussion, the temperature-dependence of the constants is illustrated in Figs. 7 to 9. We may now attempt to draw some conclusions concerning the interpretation of the apparent differences in activity [ 1 ] and in the shapes of the HZ order curves in terms of the constants of this rate expression. We begin first with the effects of pretreatment (Fig. 5) . The ensuing discussion will be (it is hoped) more comprehensible if it is understood that the pretreatments following the first have two distinct effects: one, namely O/ LTR, produces a change in surface morphology (for want of a better term) which in the case of RuECl is also accompanied by a decrease in dispersion, while the other (HTR2) changes the morphology without affecting the dispersion. These changes are shown schematically in Scheme 3. (1) The changes produced by the OILTR treatment in the reaction of both propane (Fig. 5) and n-butane [11,13] are due primarily to a decrease in KH: this is particularly 90 Geoffrey C. Bond, Joop C.

With RuECI, neither kt nor KA is much altered (Figs. 7 and 8) and with RuEC3 they are indistinguishable; nor do any significant changes occur in the values of a. (2) The HTR2 treatment produces a further decrease in KH in every case (Tables 1-3, Fig. 9), the change being somewhat less marked in ethane and propane (Table 1), and very substantial decreases in k1 (Fig. 7) and KA (Fig. 8) . Once again a is almost unaffected. (3) The same trends are observed with each alkane, so far as we can determine. We now draw attention to those respects in which the behaviours of the three alkanes differ. (1) After HTRl, both kt and KA are smaller for propane than for n-butane and this trend probably continues to ethane, but the results are not sufficiently reliable to be sure. (2) After O/LTR, values of k1 for all three alkanes are similar (Fig. 7), those for ethane 0 O ~s o LA I I i 1 I 23 2~4 2~5 2~6 2~7 10;1(7/ K) Fig. 8.

Slaa /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 98 (1995) 81-99 being perhaps slightly smaller, while somewhat surprisingly those of KA are about the same for propane and butane. (3) After HTR2, values of k, are greater for ethane and propane than for butane, but the differences are small and not highly significant; KA is about the same for propane and butane. (4) One of the tests for the validity of the methodology employed is the independence of the value of KH on the alkane used, since we are assuming the same general reaction scheme for all the alkanes, and the HZ adsorption equilibrium should be the same in all cases. This expectation is only partially fulfilled: after HTRI the values of KH for propane and butane are very similar (Fig. 9), but after the other treatments the values for ethane and propane are somewhat higher than those for butane. (Compare Tables I and 2). Comparison of the results in Tables 2 and 3, and in Figs. 7 to 9, show differences between the constants applicable to the two catalysts RuEC 1 and RuEC3 after HTR1 and O/LTR. The values of kt shown in the tables and figures are those derived from rates expressed in mmol g l cat h 1 , and for their better comparison they should be converted into specific rate constants ksp (gR ) and then into atomic rate constants kar (ns 1 where Dispersion --- (H/Ru),o, 91 Table 4 Specific and atomic rate constants for n-butane hydrogenolysis at 385 K Catalyst Pretreatment ksP (s- ' ) RuECI RUECI RuECI RuEC3 RuEC3 HTRl O/LTR HTR2 HTR1 O/LTR 0.83 0.54 0.078 0.34 0.27 ka, (s-' ) 0.095 0.29 0.098 0.14 0.27 ns represents the total number of H atoms chemisorbed per g of Ru). This latter quantity might alternatively be called the areal rate constant or the turnover rate constant, but neither term exactly conveys its significance. Rather than converting all results in this way we take interpolated values of kl for n-butane at 385 K, and obtain the results shown in Table 4. They are quite remarkable. (i) The values of ksp (excepting that for RuEC I after HTR2) vary by less than a factor of three. (ii) Those for kat are very similar for both catalysts after HTR I and HTR2, and are about three times larger after O/LTR. Thus, in contrast to all that has been written in the past concerning particle size effects on catalytic activity, it appears that the rate constant per surface atom is NOT significantly size-dependent, while the effect we attribute to `morphology' is the more important. The extent to which either rate constant varies is very much less than that of rates or turnover frequencies 0.88 RuECl h m O HTRI 0.23 -0.18 LRuEC3 HTRI j HTR2 O - ------------ -------------------- ------------------- ----------------------- O/LTR O/LTR Scheme 3.

'Values considered unreliable. Plot of 1nKH vs. 1/Tshows maximum (Fig. 8). measured at an H2:n-butane ratio of 10:1 [ 1 ] . Values of ksp and kat for the three alkanes at any selected temperature will be proportional to their kt values, since we have to assume that the same Ru contents and (H/Ru)totratios apply in each case. K,, values are similar for RuEC3 after HTR1 and O /LTR, and greater than for RuEC 1 ( Fig. 8) ; KH values are about the same for the two catalysts after HTR1, but greater for RuEC3 after O/LTR (Fig. 9). By the application of the Arrhenius equation to k, and of the Van't Hoff isochore to K,, and KH we should be able to estimate respectively the true activation energy Et and the enthalpy changes associated with the equilibria 1 and 2 in Scheme 1. This has been attempted, with the results shown in Table 5 and Figs. 7-9. Note that the values given in the table are derived from the results shown in the earlier tables, by the least squares method where possible, while the plots in Figs. 7-9 are for purposes of illustration only, so that the slopes of the lines may not correspond exactly to the values in the table. The following observations may be made. (1) True activation energies Et are considerably lower than apparent values Eapp obtained previously [ 1,11 ] using 10:1 HZ:alkane ratios. The changing shapes of the HZ order curves as the temperature is altered (Fig. 4) makes it inevitable that even the apparent activation energy will be a function of HZ pressure [13]. (2) Et appears to be about the same for all three alkanes after HTR1 and after O/LTR ( 60 5 kJ mol -1) , and possibly somewhat lower after HTR2. High precision cannot always be expected when results are obtained at only two closely similar temperatures. From the reaction scheme it appears that the rate will be maximum when the concentrations of H * and of Cx are equal: thus the maximum rates at different temperatures will correspond to equal but not necessarily constant values of their concentrations, and the activation energy derived from them may approximate to the true activation energy. From the results in Fig. 4, an activation energy based on maximum rates of about 62 kJ mol' is obtained, close to the values in Table 5. (4) Values of -dHA are higher for ethane, but comparable for propane and n-butane, irrespective of catalyst or pretreatment. However they tend to decrease in the sequence HTR1 > O/LTR > HTR2 for n-butane. We note that since Kincreases with temperature, the process defining K(Scheme 1) must be endothermic, which is compatible with its not being a simple chemisorption: thus increasing temperature favours the dehydrogenation steps leading to the reactive species, and this serves to explain why apparent activation energies for hydrogenolysis are so comparatively large, and greater than true values. ( 5 ) From Fig. 9 and Tables 1 to 3 it appears that temperature has relatively little effect on KH, especially after O/LTR and HTR2 treatments, so the values of dHH, though often small (Table 4), cannot be regarded as meaningful. We would expect 4HH to be negative if process 1 in Scheme 1 truly represents the way in which H2 becomes involved, but the expected changes in KH Geoffrey C. Bond, Joop C. Slaa /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 98 (1995) 81-99 would not necessarily be observed in the narrow temperature range used. Of greater significance is the difference between the high KH values after HTR1, and the much lower values after O/LTR and HTR2: in the former case, the onset of desorption is apparent at the higher temperatures (Fig. 9). It is also reassuring that the magnitudes and temperature coefficients of K,, and of KH are so different, in senses that correspond, at least in some degree, to physical expectations. A further word on the values of a in Tables 1 to 3 is in order (a is the number of HZ molecules released in forming the reactive species, i.e. (n - x) / 2, see Scheme 1) . They are a little greater for ethane and propane than for butane: with this last reactant, they are somewhat larger after HTR 1 than the other treatments. There is a tendency for them to decrease with increasing temperature, especially after HTR1 (see Table 2), but the effects are generally small. It is disappointing that the values obtained do not correspond more closely to the loss of integral numbers of H atoms, but the lack of great variation suggests that the numbers found have a physical significance: moreover, as noted above, values of x or a are subject to some uncertainty. We have paid little attention so far to the effects on the rate of varying the alkane pressure. In fact we have made only a few such measurements, as our previous experience [ 8 ] has shown that the results obtained are of little assistance. Orders in alkane are generally fractional and positive, and, although in principle it should be possible to analyse the results in terms of equation ES5B to provide values of all the constants, the form of the curve relating rate to alkane pressure does not provide sufficient constraints, as do the HZ order curves, to enable accurate values to be obtained. We therefore show (Fig. 3) the calculated curve obtained by using the constants derived by Hz pressure variation under equivalent conditions (set BH4). The agreement is satisfactory if not perfect, and serves to show there is no serious inconsistency between the interpretations of the two orders of reaction using this rate expression. 93 1-5 1. 13 l 07 `n 0.5 03 of 53 0 o1 o2 03 0~4 0.5 o16 o7 o8 H, pressure l atm Fig. 10. n-Butane hydrogenolysis on RuECl after HTR1: dependence of product selectivities on HZ pressure at 417 K (BH26) (circles) and at 383 K (BH31) (triangles). 3.5. Dependence of selectivity parameters on HZ pressure Thus far we have only been concerned with the dependence of rate of reactant removal on HZ pressure; we have naturally recorded product selectivities at the same time, and consideration of how they vary with HZ pressure at various temperatures adds new and important insights into reaction mechanisms and the state of the surface [ 11 ] . With RuECI following HTR1, the unusual selectivities found [ 1 ] at HZ:n-butane ratios of 10:1 (high S2, low S, and S3; T3=1, F=0.7) persist as the HZ pressure is lowered, and at the lowest temperature used (383 K) they remain essentially unchanged down to 0.1 atm. Fig. 10 shows the selectivities obtained at 417 K, and values of SZ at 383 K. We are only able to derive true values of F and T3 at 397-398 K and 418 K; these indicate that the principal factor in determining the variation in selectivities (Fig. 10) is the pressure dependence of TZ in the propane reaction, since at 417 K F is almost invariant over the whole pressure range, and T3 (for which the points are somewhat scattered due to the form of the equations used to derive it) does not fall below 0.92 ( Fig. 11) . Its pressure dependence is at most slight. The effects of temperature in the range 383-428 K on the products of both reactions are also of a minor nature: SZ decreases slightly with increasing temperature, and the HZ pressure below which S, begins to rise also increases, from = 0.1 to =z 0.2 atm.

The obvious conclusion to draw is that while the number of reactive centres ( that is, places capable of sustaining the transition state) changes dramatically with HZ pressure, the composition of these centres (that is, the number of adsorbed H atoms and vacant sites participating, and the H:C ratio in the reactive species) remains essentially constant. We must explore what circumstances might give rise to this behaviour. Reference to Scheme 1 shows that the rate of the slow step depends upon the concentrations of H atoms and of the reactive dehydrogenated intermediate CnHx : in the region of low HZ pressure, the rate is a positive function of HZ pressure because it is limited by the availability of H atoms, the concentration of which naturally rises with HZ pressure. Above the maximum, which with RuEC 1 following HTR 1 is reached at a very low H2 pressure (Fig. 2), the rate is limited by the availability of Cx , the concentration of which depends on the number of vacant sites available to receive H atoms from the reactant alkane. We therefore propose that the concentration of H atoms remains high down to HZ pressures of at most 0.05 atm, i.e. the surface is almost fully saturated with them, and the rate is in effect controlled by a small concentration of vacant sites, which becomes even smaller as the HZ pressure is raised. The number of vacant sites needed determines that the H2 order above the maximum will be strongly negative. The constancy of T3 and of TZ above about 0.15 atm HZ pressure implies that adequate numbers of H atoms are available to convert the fragments (e.g. C3 ) into gaseous alkane, and that it is only when this is not so that the alternative option of bondbreaking becomes available, as this apparently needs fewer H atoms. For this reason St rises and Sz falls with both reactions (Figs. 10 and 11) as the HZ pressure is decreased below about 0.15 atm. Our belief that HZ is strongly chemisorbed on the very small Ru particles contained in RuEC 1 after HTR1 provides a ready explanation for the absence of rapid variation of selectivities with temperature, observed previously with this catalyst [ 1,11 ] : the adsorption of HZ being strong, the coverage by H atoms does not decrease rapidly with increasing temperature. Quite different results are obtained with RuEC 1 following O/LTR and HTR2, and with RuEC3 after both HTR1 and O/LTR. Now, chiefly in consequence of changing to the use of much larger Ru particles, selectivities shown by n-butane change sensitively as the HZ pressure is altered (Fig. 12), in the sense that St increases, SZ passes through a maximum and S3 tends towards zero ( or some other low limiting value) as the HZ pressure 2.0 2, 1-5 ~ no as 0 mb S, 0 00 0-2 oa o~4 os o~6 o~7 o~e H2 pressure I atm Fig. 12.

In the case of RuECl after O/LTR, it is very clear that these changes are due entirely to T3 and not at all to F, which remains almost unaltered ( Fig. 13 ) , but at a much lower value than before. In the other cases, F decreases slightly with increasing HZ pressure, and escalates abruptly at very low HZ pressures, but this may be an artifact caused by the limitations of using TZ from the propane reaction in the calculation of F and T3. In all of these systems (RuECI, O/LTR and HTR2; RuEC3, HTR1 and O/LTR) the variation in the selectivities can be traced wholly or substantially to T3: clearly the process leading to the formation of the intermediate products propane and ethane is favoured by higher HZ pressures, which ( since none of the steps in the proposed reaction scheme, except the first, involves molecular Hz) we must assume causes an increase in the concentration of adsorbed H atoms. On these catalysts therefore HZ adsorption must be relatively weak, and full coverage by H atoms only achieved at HZ pressures approaching 1 atm. For this reason the selectivities which they show change quite quickly with increasing temperature [1], in the sense that corresponds to decreasing H coverage. The fact that the equivalent changes only occur with RuECl after HTR1 at much lower HZ pressures signifies how much stronger is HZ chemisorption on this catalyst. The concept that temperature effects on product selectivities arise mainly through changes in H atoms coverages has been previously advanced by Pa [20]. 95 Convincing independent evidence for the correctness of our interpretation of the different dependences of product selectivities on HZ pressures following the various pretreatments comes from two sources. (1) The strength of HZ chemisorption as measured by KH is seen ( Fig. 9, Tables 1-3 ) to be much greater on RuEC 1 after HTR 1 than after O/LTR or HTR2. The smaller changes found with RuEC3 reflect the lesser change in dispersion which O/LTR produces in this case (Scheme 3), and the effects of these smaller differences are observed in the product selectivities as a function of HZ at various temperatures ( sets BH 17-24, Table 3 ) . ( 2 ) Dr. B. Coq ( Montpellier) has reported [21] values for the isosteric enthalpies of HZ chemisorption by application of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to adsorption isotherms measured at various temperatures: -dHH=RTZ( 81nP18T) o The results (Fig. 14) show that enthalpies given by RuEC 1 are at least twice as large as those given by RuEC3: adsorption at high coverage is more rapid on the latter. The enthalpy values recorded in Table 5 relate to a more or less fully covered surface and for this reason, and because of their limited accuracy, they do not reveal this trend. It may still exist, however, but it is also possible that the entropy change contributes importantly to the value of KH. It may at first sight seem paradoxical that the processes requiring the greatest number of H atoms in the stoichiometric sense proceed most readily when the surface concentration of H atoms is low (Figs. 9 and 11). The problem disappears 80 'so ~` 40 a zo of ~ L IL I 04 0s o-6 0~7 0~8 0.9 1o e Fig. 14.

Circles, plot corresponding to the results in Fig. 13; squares, TZ for the reaction of propane on RuECI after O/LTR, 408 K. when it is appreciated that, because of the dehydrogenated state of the reactive intermediates (Schemes 1 and 2), more H atoms are needed to form the corresponding gaseous alkane than to effect C-C bond fission. It should be possible to quantify this difference from the dependences of T2 and T3 on HZ pressure. Recalling the definition of T3 we may write T3/(1 T3)=k3'/k3=(K3'/K3)(&H/%) a and b being the numbers of H atoms required to convert C3 into respectively gaseous propane, and into CZ and Ci fragments. An analogous expression may be written for T2. By making certain approximations (e.g. that the rate-determining step is slower than the rate of desorption of H atoms (Scheme 1), and that KHPH is less than unity) we are able to estimate (a-b) from a plot of log [ T3 / (1- T3) ] against 1ogPH. Good to excellent linear log-log plots are indeed obtained (Fig. 15) , the slope for the system RuEC 1-O / LTR at 398 K being 1.06. It would therefore appear that two more H atoms are needed to effect the desorption of C3 as propane than to convert it to fragments. This is very direct proof of the dehydrogenated state of the reactive intermediate. Estimated values of (a - b), designated t3 for the n-butane reaction and t2 for the propane reaction, are included in Tables 1-3. For n-butane with both RuECI and RuEC3 after HTR1 and O/LTR, values of t3 are 1.0-1.2, but after HTR2 they are significantly larger, as indeed are the values of t2 ( = 1.7 after O/LTR, =2.3 after HTR2). It is therefore implied that the reactive intermediate must in both cases be more dehydrogenated after HTR2, and more dehydrogenated for propane than for butane. 3.6. A synthesis of mechanistic proposals It is now time to attempt to synthesise a coherent reaction model from the available kinetic parameters, and to explore what consistencies and what shortcomings there are in the methodology that has been adopted. We first examine the interrelations between the estimated numbers of H atoms x affixed to the reactive species (listed in the Tables as a, where a = (n - x) / 2) : the number naturally depends on the number of carbon atoms n, so we distinguish the various values by applying the subscript n. We have to remember that the x parameter is probably the least accurately obtained in the modelling, so some latitude must be allowed. Now if at a given temperature the C3 species formed from butane is the same as that formed by dissociative chemisorption of propane, and if the CZ species formed from either propane or butane equate to that formed from ethane, and if the assumption made in the kinetic model (Scheme 1) that only one H atom is required to break the C-C bond in all three reactive species, there should be simple numerical connections between the values of xn, as follows. x4+ 1=x3 +xt x4+ 1= 2x2 X3+ 1=x2 +XI x2 + 1=2x1 (a) (b) (c) It is only for results obtained after the O/LTR treatment at 397-400 K that a complete set of kinetic parameters is available: taking rounded mean values from the Tables we have: X4= 7.5; x3= 5.3; x2= 2.5. It is immediately apparent that Geoffrey C. Bond, Joop C.

A possible description of the H content of intermediate species in the hydrogenolysis of the lower alkanes. there is no single value of xl which fits all three equations in which it appears; furthermore the value of x2 derived from equation a' (4.25) is not that observed. The most reasonable explanation of the discrepancies is that the C3 and CZ species formed by bond-splitting have to lose further H atoms in order to become the reactive species for further hydrogenolysis. A possible state of affairs is summarised in Scheme 4. Two further tests of the methodology may be made. (1) If our analysis above of the significance of the dependence of selectivities on HZ pressure is correct, the following relations will hold: t2=5-x2 t3=7-x3 Observed mean values (Tables 1 and 2) are: t2 = 3.3; t3 = 2.1. Values calculated from the above values of xare respectively 2.5 and 1.7: the agreement, not perfect, is at least satisfactory. (2) Some connection between values of KA and of x or a may be expected, since both pertain to the same process, namely, the dehydrogenative chemisorption of the reactant alkane. In fact, as noted above, values of a vary remarkably little: after O/LTR, about the same values are found for propane and for butane, for RuEC 1 and RuEC3 (1.2 0.1, see Tables 1-3) , independent of KA 97 and of the variables which cause KA to change. After HTRl, values of a decline slightly as KA increases, but only (with RuEC 1) from 1.6 to 1.35. These observations tend to confirm the physical significance of a and of the adsorbed species it denotes. After HTR2, values of a are again 1.2 0.1, but corresponding KA values are very small, a fact which we take to contribute to the low activity shown after this pretreatment. We are uncertain what significance should be attached to values of x that are clearly non-integral (see e.g. Scheme 4); our tentative belief is that they represent averages over several species of different reactivity (Scheme 2) . 4. Conclusions This work is an attempt to penetrate more deeply into the origins and causes of the particlesize dependence of `catalytic activity' in alkane hydrogenolysis: it is possible that our conclusions may have more general validity. Our approach has been to select a rate expression derivable from a reaction model of the kind that has found widespread support in the literature, and, by determining the H2 orders for ethane, propane and butane at several temperatures on Ru/A1203 catalysts constituted and pretreated so as to show different 98 Geoffrey C. Bond, Joop C. Slaa / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 98 (1995) 81-99 degrees of dispersion and different `surface morphologies', to seek the underlying reasons for differences in behaviour in terms of the constants of the rate expression, terms which have some degree of physical significance. The use of mathematical modelling in this context is not without its difficulties. In order to constrain the number of variables to a reasonable total, taken to be three (excluding the scaling k,), it is necessary to devise a simple model and to include assumptions which one might prefer to avoid. These assumptions include the constancy of active area and the independence of x on HZ pressure: moreover it may be naive to expect that the same basic mechanism will apply to all three alkanes. The rate expression ES5B provides satisfactory fits to all experimental results, but we have not shown, or indeed tried to show, that other expressions are less satisfactory: it was selected on the basis of the reasonableness of the mechanistic postulates. Careful inspection of the results shows however that the fit is relatively poorer at high HZ pressures, a fact not clearly revealed in Figs. 2, 4 and 5, but very noticeable when log (rate) is plotted against H2 pressure (Fig. 6). We attempted to perform optimisation using log(rate) instead of rate, but this places greater stress on the low rate measurements made at high H2 pressure, and no overall improvement seemed possible. We are certain that ES5B is not the perfect rate expression, but we are unsure whether a better exists with no more disposable constants. The extent to which the use of this expression is successful may be judged in terms of the rationality of the constants and their temperaturedependence. Although values of KH are not the same for all three alkanes, their temperature coefficients are low, as may be expected. KA varies in a manner compatible with a dehydrogenation process, and the extent of H atom loss, given by x or a, is of reasonable magnitude, being greater for ethane than for propane or butane. The near-constancy of the atomic rate constants (Table 4) and of true activation energies (Table 5) sheds a very revealing light on the origins of particle-size effects: our analysis shows that it is the thermo- dynamic parameters KH and KA, and their consequential effects on concentrations of adsorbed intermediates, that play the dominant role in deciding reaction rates. We believe that our conclusions are correct, at least in broad outline, but numerous problems remain to be addressed. We have not tried to understand why KH and KA are responsive to particle size and surface morphology, or why (in disagreement with a recent report [22] ) HZ chemisorption appears to be strong, and yet kinetically so slow, on very small Ru particles, on each of which there cannot be more than about one active centre operating at a time. Nevertheless this strength of chemisorption is clearly revealed by the lack of marked dependence of product selectivities on HZ pressure and on temperature. In previous work with other supported Ru catalysts, especially those having a very high dispersion [ 3 ] or intentionally modified [ 23 ] or accidentally poisoned [ 24 ] , we have noticed a similar behaviour in respect of temperature, but it is not yet clear whether or why the chemisorption of HZ on these unclean surfaces should be unusually strong. The origin of the effects we have attributed to `surface morphology' is also unclear. Other workers have recorded similar effects after oxidative treatments [ 4,5 ] , but their discussions are unsatisfactory in that they are based only on rate measurements. One possible candidate explanation is the continued existence of Rux+ ions in association with the Ruparticles, perhaps residing between the metal and the support: their presence is clearly indicated by EXAFS measurements on RuEC 1 [ 1 ] and they resist reduction even at 770 K. Greater concentrations after O/LTR are not impossible, and their effect in rendering metal particles somewhat electron-deficient is an alternative approach to that described vaguely as `morphology'. However differences in particle shape, or in the type of exposed crystal plane, i.e. true morphological effects, cannot be eliminated. In conclusion we believe that this work has raised a number of important questions concerning the origins of particle-size effects in catalysis, and we think that failure to attend to the additional Geoffrey C. Bond, Joop C. Slaa /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 98 (1995) 81-99 dimensions afforded by changing reactant pres sures and temperature may be largely responsible for the unsatisfactory state of the relevant litera ture [ 25 ] .

(+ 44-895)256844 The H2 pressure dependence of rates of hydrogenolysis of ethane, propane and n-butane on Ru Al2O3 catalysts differing in dispersion and type of pretreatment has been measured at a number of temperatures, and the results interpreted in terms of a mechanism involving adsorbed partially dehydrogenated intermediates C n H x , and modelled by the derived rate expression. The rate-limiting step is taken as the reaction of C n H x with an adsorbed H atom. We thus obtain best-fit values of the rate constant k 1, the H2 adsorption equilibrium constant K H, an equilibrium constant for the dehydrogenation of the alkane K A, and of x, for each set of results. The shapes of the kinetic curves, and the constants that describe them, change markedly with dispersion, and with pretreatment: oxidation and low-temperature reduction ( O LTR ), as well as causing some loss of dispersion, gives rise to other effects, ascribed to ‘morphological’ factors, not seen when catalysts are reduced at high temperature (753 K). What is most striking is that differences in activity seem to be determined much more by the constants K A and K H than by the rate constant k 1, which when expressed per Ru surface atom varies at most three-fold. In particular K H is much larger after the first high-temperature reduction (HTR1) than after O LTR . The true activation energy derived from the temperature-dependence of k 1 is about the same for each alkane (≈ 60 kJ mol−1), the enthalpy changes for H2 chemisorption are small and for alkane dehydrogenation they lie between 50 and 130 kJ mol−1. The manner in which product selectivities vary with H2 pressure also depends on dispersion and pretreatment, the dominant factor being the strength of H2 chemisorption. Thus on a very highly dispersed catalyst for which K H is large, intermediate product selectivities are high because the high concentration of H atoms facilitates desorption of adsorbed species, and for this reason also selectivities scarcely respond to changes in H2 pressure. With the same catalyst after O LTR , however, when K H is much decreased, selectivities respond sensitively to H2 pressure because the adsorption is weaker. It is then deduced that approximately two more H atoms are required to effect desorption of intermediates as a product alkane than to cause further CC bond breaking. Our results strongly suggest that structure-sensitivity in alkane hydrogenolysis is more the result of variations in chemisorption energetics, and their consequential effects on surface coverage, than of kinetic effects; this concept also accounts for dispersion-dependent differences in the temperature-dependence of product selectivities previously reported.
