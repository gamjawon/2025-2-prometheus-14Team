The active sites of dimerization and isomerization of 2-methyl- 1-alkenes over Re207 A1203 catalyst were investigated. For this purpose, a Si02 A1203/sulfuric acid Bronsted acid catalyst and a WCIb Lewis acid catalyst were also used to reveal the active sites of dimerization. These catalysts produced dimers of 2-methyl-l-alkenes selectively. The dimers and product distribution obtained from 2 methyl-1-pentene and 2-methyl-l-hexene over Re207-A'203 catalyst were the same as those over WCIb, suggesting the main active sites of dimerization are Lewis acid in character. In the reaction of 2-methyl- 1-butene over Re207-A1203 catalyst, the active sites of dimerization were found to be both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites. The dimers produced on Bronsted acid and Lewis acid sites differed from one another as judged by retention volumes determined by gas chromatography. Key words: alkenes; alumina; dimerization; isomerization; rhenium 1. Introduction It is well known that Re207 AI203 catalyst is one of the best metathesis catalysts due to its high activity and selectivity. Indeed we have shown that n-alkenes [ 1,2], a,ardienes [3,4], 1,4-alkadienes [4-6], and alkyl-substituted alkenes [7-9], excepting alkyl-substituted vinyl compounds undergo metathesis with high activity and selectivity of > 94% over CsN03-Re2O7-AI203 catalysts. *Corresponding author; fax.

Kawai et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalvsis 90 (1994) I-/0 However, the alkyl-substituted vinyl compounds have exhibited anomalous reaction behavior over Re20,-A'203 metathesis catalysts [ 8,9] . In this case, the catalyst promoted double-bond shift to the resulting isomer and co-metathesis. Homometathesis did not occur at all. Furthermore, dimers were mainly obtained over Re20,-A'203 catalysts activated at low temperature or reduced with hydrogen gas [9]. As it has been believed that Re207_ A1z03 metathesis catalysts do not have activity for double-bond shift isomerization and dimerization, these findings are of interest. The metathesis of methyl-substituted vinyl compounds has received relatively little atten tion. It has been reported that 3-methyl-2-hexene (3-Me-2-C6) over (n Bu)4N1Mo(CO)6C1-MeAlC12 [10], and 2-methyl-l-butene (2-Me-1-C4) over WO(OPh)4 AIC13 Et3A1 [ 11 ], were homometathesized. However, there is no mention of isomerization and dimerization in the papers. Although not employing metathesis catalysts, the isomerization of 2-Me-1-CQ and methylene cycloalkane on CU-Si02 [ 12], and of 2 Me-1-CS and 3-Me-1-CS with various oxide catalysts [ 13] has been reported, but again with no mention of dimerization. The dimerization reaction of isobutene to diisobutene has been carried out on sulfuric acid and solid catalysts having Bronsted acidity such as Si02 A1203 and zeolite [ 14] . Studies on the isomerization and dimerization of methyl-substituted vinyl compounds using Re20,-AI203 metathesis catalysts are absent from the literature apart from two papers originating. in this laboratory [ 8,9 ] . Our experiments have shown that 2-Me-l-alkenes undergo rapid double-bond shift isomerization and dimerization over the Re207-AI203 catalyst, which has mostly Lewis acid sites, and over the Si02 AIZ03 catalyst, which is a typical Bronsted acid catalyst system [8,9]. This work is to clarify the nature of the active sites of isomerization and dimerization for 2-methyl-l-alkenes on the Re,0, A1203 catalyst. To elucidate whether only the Re207_ A1203 catalyst has active sites for the isomerization and dimerization reaction, the reaction behavior of methyl-substituted alkenes over the WCI,- Me4Sn metathesis catalyst has also been investigated. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts Re207-AI203 catalyst (Re207; 17.4 wt.%, 40-60 mesh) was prepared using the impregnation technique as described in previous papers [ 1,3] . A Si02-A1203 obtained from Catalysts and Chemicals Industries (IS-28, A1203 29.07%, Na20 0.01%, S04 0.28%, 420 m2 g-' ) was milled and sieved, and 40-60 mesh was used. Sulfuric acid as the source Bronsted acid sites, and WClo purified by sublimation as the source Lewis acid sites were also used as catalysts. 2.2. Reagents 2-Me- 1-CQ obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, 2-Me-1-C5, 2-Me-2-C5 and 2-Me-1-C3 obtained from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo and 2-Me-1-C6 obtained from Aldrich, were used as starting materials. These reagents were dried over SA molecular sieves, and used T. Kawai et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 1-10 3 without further purification, since GC analysis confirmed a purity of > 99% for each. Monochlorobenzene used as solvent was dried over P205 and purified by rectification. 2.3. Procedure The reactions were carried out in the liquid phase at atmospheric pressure using a continuous-flow system for the Re20,-AI203 and Si02-A12O3 catalysts. The detailed exper imental procedures are essentially the same as previously described [ 8 ] . The reaction of 2 Me-1-C3 over S'OZ AI203 was carried out in a batch system at -35 C. In the reaction catalyzed by sulfuric acid, 50% sulfuric acid was used and the reaction time and temperature were 30 min and 20 C, respectively. In the reaction catalyzed by WCIb, monochlorobenzene was used as solvent and the reaction conditions were temperature: 20 C and time: 30 min. The reaction conditions over the WCI6- Me4Sn catalyst system were as follows; W/Sn/ alkene=1 /2/ 125, temperature: 60 C, time: 20 min. The reaction products were analyzed on Shimadzu 9 AM gas chromatograph equipped with a 50 m OV-1 chemically bonded capillary column and an FID. For the identification of reaction products, MS spectra were recorded using Shimadzu GCMS-QP2000A. The data obtained were analyzed using the following definitions: 2-/1-=1/R= [2-Me-2-C4/2-Me-1-C4] where 2-/1- indicates the isomer ratio, taken to be the amount of isomer remaining (I) relative to the amount of starting material remaining (R). This equation illustrates the case of the reaction of 2-Me-1-C4. ISO(%) = (I+C+H+D) X 100/A where ISO is the degree of isomerization. A is the number of moles of reactant used, C the number of moles of co-metathesis products formed, H the number of moles of homometathesis products of the isomer formed, and D the number of moles of dimers formed. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Reaction behavior of methyl-substituted alkenes over the Re207A120j and WCl6 MeQSn catalyst systems The reaction behavior of the methyl-substituted alkenes was investigated for the WClb Me4Sn catalyst system in order to make a comparison with those of the Re207-A12O3 catalyst activated at 500 C for 1.5 h under nitrogen flow; the latter catalyst shows high activity and selectivity for the metathesis of a variety of alkenes. The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Except for 2-Me-1-C6, Me- l-alkenes were homometathesized selectively over the WC16-Me4Sn catalyst similarly to the Re207-Al2O3 catalyst. The reactivity decreased in the following order; 5->4- 3-Me-1-C6. The order is the same, but the structure of alkene affects greatly the reactivity over the WCI6- Me4Sn catalyst compared 4 T Kawai et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 1-10 Table 1 Reaction a of various alkenes over Re207-A'203 Alkene Conv.

It seems that the steric hindrance encountered when the metallacyclobutane intermediates are formed plays an important role in the reactivity [ 2,9 ] . In the reaction of 2-Me-1-C6 over the WCI6- Me4Sn catalyst, the isomerization occurred with ease, but neither homometathesis nor co-metathesis products were formed, and the dimers were produced selectively. A similar reaction behavior for 2-Me-1-CS (conversion: 71.3%, ISO: 44.0%, 2-/ 1-: 2.7, dimer selectivity: - 100%) was observed over the WCIb Me4Sn catalyst at reaction temperature 40 C. Thus, it was found that 2-Me-l-alkenes underwent isomerization and dimerization even over WCIb-Me4Sn catalyst system. On the other hand, co-metathesis products were the main products over the Re20,-A'203 catalyst activated at 500 C and the dimer was formed only in small amounts. For example, in the reaction of 2-Me-1-C6 the catalyst promoted the double-bond shift isomerization to the resulting isomer (2-Me-2-C6) and subsequent co-metathesis. The major reaction products were 5-Me-4-C9 and 2-Me- I -C' by co-metathesis, but the other co-metathesis products, I 3 'and 2,3-DMe-2 5 _C7 were not detected. The homometathesis of 2-Me-1-C6 did not occur at all, and that of 2-Me-2-C6, producing 2,3-DMe-2-C4 and 4-C8, occurred to a small extent [8,9]. 3.2. Reaction behavior of 2-methyl-l-alkenes We have reported that the dimerization of 2-Me-1-C6 occurred over Re207-A'203 catalyst T.

At activation temperatures lower than 150 C, the main product was dimer with a few cometathesis products for the reaction of 2-Me-1-C6 [9]. The dimers were obtained with > 95% selectivity over Re207-A1203 catalyst reduced with hydrogen gas above 300 C. Also Si02-A1203, which is a typical Bronsted acid catalyst, showed very high activity toward isomerization and dimerization [9]. To determine whether other alkyl-substituted vinyl compounds behave similarly to 2-Me-1-C6, the reaction of 2-Me- l-alkenes was studied using both the Re207-AI203catalyst activated at 140 C, and the Si02-AI203 catalyst. The results of reaction behavior of 2-Me- l-alkenes over Re207-AI203catalyst are shown in Table 3. The main reaction products were dimers with > 70% selectivity and the rest were metathesis. products. The mass balance was > 97%. It was found that the major metathesis products were co-metathesis products and the homometathesis products of isomer were only present in small amounts. Their reaction routes are similar to that described for 2-Me-1-C6. The conversion level and the selectivity to dimers of each reactant were almost the same, suggesting that there is no relation between the molecular structure and reactivity. However, the equilibrium conversion might have been attained under the reaction conditions. An obvious difference between the selectivity to dimers and the molecular size of reactant is not observed. The 2-/ 1- ratio increased with the increase in the molecular size of reactant. When 2-Me-2-C5 was applied over the Re207-AI203catalyst activated at 150 C, the dimers were also obtained selectively. These facts suggest that all kinds of alkyl-substituted vinyl compounds undergo dimerization selectively over the Re20,-AI203catalyst. The results obtained over Si02-A1203 as a typical Bronsted acid catalyst are shown in 6 T. Kawai et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) I-10 Table 4. The only products were dimers under the reaction conditions employed. The reactivity of reactant decreased with an increase in molecular size and the 2-/ 1- values showed the same tendency. 2-Me-1-C3 was dimerized selectively over Si02 A1203 at - 35 C in a batch system under atmospheric pressure. The main reaction products were dimers consisting of 80% 2,4,4trimethyl-l-CS and 20% 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-C5, accompanied by trimer and oligomer. The Re,O, A1203 and WCI6- Me4Sn catalysts were inactive for 2-Me-1-C3 at - 35 C. 3.3. Investigations into the active sites for dimerization and dimers in the reaction of 2 methyl-1-pentene The dimers of 2-Me-1-CS were produced with high selectivity and the values of 2-/ 1were more than 4 over the ReZ07-A1203 and Si02-A1203 catalysts (Tables 3 and 4). To determine the nature of the active sites for dimerization and isomerization, sulfuric acid, a SIOz-AI308 H2SOs retention time (min) Fig. 1. Gas chromatograms of dimer region of 2-methyl- l-pentene. T. Kawai et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 1-10 7 typical source of Bronsted acid sites and WC16, a typical source of Lewis acid sites, were used as catalysts and it was found that they dimerized 2-Me- l-alkenes selectively. The gas chromatograms of dimer region produced by the reaction of 2-Me-1-CS over the various kinds of catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. Compounds with the same relative retention time were found to have the same chemical identity by comparison of their GC-MS data. The product distributions obtained from the sulfuric acid and Si02-AI203 catalysts were in good agreement in each other, suggesting that peak 1 at least was produced over Bronsted acid sites. The main products obtained by WC16 were peaks 2 and 3, which were only minor products in the SiO27 A1203 and sulfuric acid systems. The product distribution over Re207A1203 catalyst was very close to that of WC16, suggesting the most of active sites of Re207A1z03 catalyst are Lewis acid sites. The fragment patterns of Peaks 1, 2 and 3 were almost same. 3.4. Investigations into the active sites for dimerization and dimers in the reaction of 2 methyl-l -butene The gas chromatograms of dimer region produced by the reaction of 2-Me- 1-CQ over various kinds of catalysts are shown in Fig. 2.

Kawai et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalvsis 90 (1994) 1-10 time were found to have the same chemical identities by comparison of their GC-MS data. Several dimers were formed over the Si02-A'203 and sulfuric acid catalyst systems, but the product distributions were the same. On the other hand, the WCIb catalyst produced predominantly two kinds of dimers; peaks 6 and 8. Over the Re20,-A]203 catalyst, the reaction products were complicated, but it is clear from the comparison with the other reaction products that they are produced over both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites. The compounds responsible for peaks 6 and 8 were produced over Lewis acid sites and their fragment patterns were almost the same. On the other hand, the compounds of peaks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 were produced over Bronsted acid sites. These show that Re207-Al2O3 catalyst has both Lewis and Bronsted acid sites. Judging from the fragment patterns, the main dimers can be placed in three different groups; peaks 3 and 4, peaks 5, 6 and 8, and peak 7. 3.5.

T Kawai et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 1-10 9 distributions obtained from sulfuric acid and the Si02-AI203 catalyst were the same. On the other hand, WCIb produced different dimers from those produced over Bronsted acid catalysts. The product distribution obtained from Re20,-AI203 catalyst was almost the same as that from WCIb, suggesting the main active sites of dimerization over Re207-AI203 catalyst should be Lewis acid sites. The dimer responsible for peak 1 produced over ReZ07A1203 catalyst was only a minor product. The GC-MS of peaks 1-4 were almost the same. 3.6. Dimerization over reduced ReZOrAl203 catalyst It has been reported that 2-Me-1-C6 was dimerized selectively over Re20,-A]203 catalyst reduced with hydrogen at temperatures higher than 200 C [9]. It was found that not only 2-Me-1-C6 but also 2-Me-1-C4 and 2-Me-1-CS were dimerized selectively over ReZ07A1203 catalyst reduced at 500 C. The product distributions of dimers from each reactant are almost the same with those obtained over Re207-AI203 catalyst activated at 150 C. Further investigations are under the way with the aim of acquiring further data for a better characterization of active sites and the identification of dimer structure. 4. Conclusion The dimerization of 2-Me- l-alkene in the liquid phase under atmospheric pressure and mild reaction conditions occurs selectively on a variety of catalysts, e.g., Re207-AI203 activated at temperatures lower than 140 C or reduced with hydrogen gas above 300 C, WCIb, WCI6- Me4Sn, 1-12S04 and Si02-AI203. Active species for dimerization are both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites. The structures of dimers produced on Bronsted acid sites differ from those produced on Lewis acid sites. The dimers produced over Re207-AI203 were mainly produced through Lewis acid sites. References [ 1 ] T. Kawai, Y. Yamazaki and A. Tokumura, Sekiyu Gakkai Shi, 26 (1983) 332. [ 2 ] T. Kawai, H.

(+81-426) 772821. Not only 2-methyl-1-hexene but also other 2-methyl-1-alkenes were dimerized selectively over a Re2O7Al2O3 catalyst activated at temperatures lower than 140°C or reduced with hydrogen gas above 300°C and also over a WCl6Me4Sn catalyst system in the liquid phase under atmospheric pressure and mild reaction conditions. The active sites of dimerization and isomerization of 2-methyl-1-alkenes over Re2O7Al2O3 catalyst were investigated. For this purpose, a SiO2Al2O3/sulfuric acid Brønsted acid catalyst and a WCl6 Lewis acid catalyst were also used to reveal the active sites of dimerization. These catalysts produced dimers of 2-methyl-1-alkenes selectively. The dimers and product distribution obtained from 2-methyl-1-pentene and 2-methyl-1-hexene over Re2O7Al2O3 catalyst were the same as those over WCl6, suggesting the main active sites of dimerization are Lewis acid in character. In the reaction of 2-methyl-1-butene over Re2O7Al2O3 catalyst, the active sites of dimerization were found to be both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. The dimers produced on Brønsted acid and Lewis acid sites differed from one another as judged by retention volumes determined by gas chromatography.
