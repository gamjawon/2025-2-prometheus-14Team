Czech Republic b Department of Physical and Macromolecular Chemistry, Charles University. Albertor 2030, 728 40 Prague 2, Czech Republic Abstract A suspension of commercial WCI4 initiates rapid polymerization of norbomene and norbornadiene under mild conditions. If norbo_rnenyl acetate is used as a substrate, WCI4 is dissolved and homogeneous polymerization occurs. In both cases polymers (M,, = about 80000), the structure of which corresponds to the ring-opening metathesis mode of polymerization, were prepared. _ WC14 has also been found to polymerize monosubstituted acetylenes (benzene, 50). Poly(t-butylacetylene) of MW = 600000, poly(phenylacetylene) of M,, = 200000 and poly(1-hexyne) of MW = 14000 were prepared in high yields. When WC14 was dissolved in the reaction with oxygen-containing compounds (e.g. methyl acetate, acetylacetone, acetophenone) before substrate addition, catalyst activity increased significantly. WC14 in 1,4-dioxane was found to be a very active system for phenylacetylene polymerization; it polymerizes this monomer at the monomer-to-catalyst mole ratio equal to 1000 providing polymer of MW =400000. 1. Introduction In the catalyst systems based on WC16 (widely used for olefin metathesis and related reactions), reduction of tungsten to the lower oxidation states was postulated to participate in the transformation of WCIb into the catalytic active species (tungsten carbenes) [1]. This reduction is accomplished by addition of cocatalyst and/or by the substrate itself. For example, Masuda et al. [2] found an average oxidation state of W = IV in active catalyst solution formed from WC16 and Ph4Sn. Similarly, for ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbomene Corresponding author. 1381-1169/97/$17.00 Copyright 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. P11 S1381-1169(96)00094-5 (NBE) by WCIb, WC14 formed in situ was suggested to be a close precursor of active centres [3]. However, according to our experience, no attempt has been reported to use pure WC14 directly as catalyst in ROMP and acetylenes polymerization (only a mention is given in the Ref. [4] but without specification of any results). The insolubility of WC14 in aromatic solvents was probably the main discouragement. We decided to test the activity of WC14 in the polymerization of NBE and its derivatives: norbornadiene (NBDE) and 5-norbomen-2-yl acetate (NBEAc) and some monosubstituted acetylenes (Eqs. (1)-(3)). These monomers are known to transform high valent tungsten chlorides (WCI6, WOC14, WC15) into the metatheti- 102 H. Balcar, M.

Experimental 2.1. Materials (2) (3) WC14 (Aldrich), 97%, used without any purification. Methyl acetate, acetylacetone, epichlorohydrin, acetophenone and 1,4-dioxane (all purum) were purified by conventional methods (i.e. they were distilled, dried, and degassed in vacuo). Norbornene and norbornadiene (both Fluka, purum) were distilled from NaH, 5norbornen-2-yl acetate (Janssen Chimica, 98% purity, 80% of endo-isomer) was distilled in vacuo, (acidity number was 0.9). Phenylacetylene (Fluka, purum), 1-hexyne (Fluka, purum) and t-butylacetylene (Aldrich, 98%) were dried with NaH and distilled in vacuo. Benzene was purified by HZS04, dried with NaH, distilled and degassed in vacuo. Details are given elsewhere [7,8]. 2.2. Procedures All procedures were carried out under purified Ar or in vacuo using the standard vacuum break-seals technique. Polymers were isolated by precipitation in methanol and dried in vacuo at 40. The polymer yields were determined by gravimetry. 2.3. Techniques IR spectra of polymers (in KBr pellets) were recorded on Specord 75 IR. Molecular weights of polymers were measured by SEC using polystyrene calibration method (Polymer Standard Service). TSP liquid chromatograph system equipped with CM 3200 pump, SM 3200 UV detector working at 254 nm and RI detectors, two columns 300 mm packed with PL-gel (mixed B and mixed C), and THF as the mobile phase (0.7 ml/min) at room temperature were used. The SEC analysis of polyacetylenes were carried out using standard procedure [9] in order to minimize an influence of the polymer degradation on the results obtained [ 10]. NMR spectra of polymers were measured in CC14 on a Varian Unity 500 spectrometer (500 MHz, TMS as an external standard). UV-VIS spectra of the catalyst solutions were recorded on a Hewlett Packard HP 89500 spectrometer using sealed evacuated cuvette. 3. Results 3.1. Polymerization of NBE and its derivatives with WCl4 The results of the polymerization of NBE, NBEAc and NBDE are given in Table 1. Suspension of commercial WC14 initiates polymerization of all these monomers to high polymer yields. In the case of NBE and NBDE, solid phase of tungsten chloride was observed during the whole polymerization process, but if NBEAc was used as a monomer, the insoluble H. Balcar, M. PacousM/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 115 (1997) 101-105 phase disappeared (and the benzene phase turned red) before the viscosity of the polymerization mixture began to increase. It suggests that in the latter case, WC14 was dissolved due to the interaction with ester groups of NBEAc and most probably homogeneous polymerization occurred. Poly(NBDE) was formed as an insoluble, intractable polymer (probably due to the high cross-linking). Samples of poly(NBE) and poly(NBEAc) were soluble in aromatics (benzene, toluene, chlorobenzene) and THF, weight average molecular weights were about 80 000 and IR spectra of both polymers provided evidence that ROMP really occurred (the presence of the bands corresponding to the double bonds along the main chain: for poly(NBEAc) 973, 755 and 1408 cm - 1 and for poly(NBE) 966, 740 and 1408 cm-1). The spectra of poly(NBEAc) are identical with those reported for poly(NBEAc) prepared with catalyst systems WC16/Me4Sn [11]. In the case of poly(NBE), however, there is a significant difference in the relative intensities of the IR bands at 966 cm-1 (trans double bond 8CH vibration) and at 740 cm-1 (cis double bond 8CH vibration) between polymers prepared with WC14 and WC16/Me4Sn, respectively. The ratio of absorbances Ay66/A740 was found to range from 1.6 to 1.8 for poly(NBE)s prepared with WC14, whereas to be equal to 2.8 for poly(NBE) prepared using WC16,/Me4Sn catalyst (mole ratio Sn/W = 4, benzene, 50). It indicates higher content of cis units in polymers prepared with 103 WC14 in comparison with that prepared using WC16/Me4Sn system. 3.2. Polymerization of monosubstituted acetylenes with WCl4 Table 2 shows the results of experiments in which phenylacetylene (PhA), t-butylacetylene (t-BuA) and 1-hexyne were polymerized by suspension of WC14 in benzene. In polymerizations using WC14 in the presence of oxygen containing compounds, Table 2, the catalyst was dissolved prior to the addition of monomer. WC14 was allowed to react with each compound from the following series (mole ratio 1:1, benzene, 50-60): methyl acetate (MeOAc), acetylacetone (AcAc), acetophenone (AcPh) and epichlorohydrin (EPCH). These dissolution reactions proceeded relatively slowly, but after several hours the solid phase disappeared and coloured solutions (approximately OA M with respect to W) arose. Additionally, WC14 was treated with excess of MeOAc and 1,4-dioxane, resp. (without benzene) and brown solutions appeared (about O.IM with respect to W) after several days at room temperature. All the solutions prepared were stable at least for a week (their UV-VIS spectra, Fig. 1, were not exhibiting any changes within this period). It is seen from Table 2 that WC14 represents an efficient catalyst for polymerization of monosubstituted acetylenes. Its efficiency further increased as a result of WC14 reaction with oxygen containing organic compounds given Table l Polymerization of NBE, NBDE and NBEAc with WC14 dispersion in benzene, co - initial monomer concentration, t - reaction temperature, MW and Ma- weight-average and number-average molecular weight No. Monomer Mole ratio monomer/W co (mol/1) t () Time (h) Polymer yield (%) MW M~ 1 NBE 100 2.7 25 19 25 - - 2 NBE 100 2.7 50 3 23 - - 3 NBE 100 4.5 25 19 70 81 000 35000 4 NBDE 100 4.6 25 19 93 - - 5 NBEAc 75 3.4 80 2 48 89 000 34 000 WCl.j dissolved in the reaction mixture. 104 H.

In the case of PhA polymerization, the systems arising from the reaction of WC14 with AcPh (1:1) and of WC14 with the excess of MeOAc or 1,4-dioxane have been found as very effective, since they provided high polymer yields in several minutes at room temperature (No. 7, 8, 10).

Their configurational structure (on the basis of the IR and 1 H-NMR spectra) was similar to that of poly(PhA)s prepared by other tungsten catalysts (high trans double bond content and low content of units comprised in cyclohexadiene sequences [12)) with exception of poly(PhA)s prepared using WC14 in 1,4-dioxane, in which higher content of cis double bond was observed (about 80% cis junctions using Simionecsu formula [13]). Similar influence of 1,4-dioxane addition to the tungsten based catalyst (the increase of molecular weight and cis double bond content of poly(PhA) prepared) has already been observed for WOC14/Ph4Sn system [14,15]. The results presented here show that WC14 (either in benzene suspension or dissolved using appropriate compounds) is an effective catalyst for polymerization of norbornene type monomers as well as monosubstituted acetylenes. They support also the suggestion (made earlier [1-3,8]) that W(IV) chloride species, formed in situ from the catalyst systems based on high valent tungsten chlorides, are the closest precursors of catalytic centres for olefin metathesis and acetylenes polymerization.

A suspension of commercial WCl4 initiates rapid polymerization of norbornene and norbornadiene under mild conditions. If norbornenyl acetate is used as a substrate, WCl4 is dissolved and homogeneous polymerization occurs. In both cases polymers ( M ̄ w = about 80 000), the structure of which corresponds to the ring-opening metathesis mode of polymerization, were prepared. WCl4 has also been found to polymerize monosubstituted acetylenes (benzene, 50°C).

        "dc:description": "A suspension of commercial WCl4 initiates rapid polymerization of norbornene and norbornadiene under mild conditions. If norbornenyl acetate is used as a substrate, WCl4 is dissolved and homogeneous polymerization occurs. In both cases polymers ( M ̄ w = about 80 000), the structure of which corresponds to the ring-opening metathesis mode of polymerization, were prepared. WCl4 has also been found to polymerize monosubstituted acetylenes (benzene, 50°C). Poly(t-butylacetylene) of M ̄ w = 600 000, poly(phenylacetylene) of M ̄ w = 200 000 and poly(1-hexyne) of M ̄ w = 14 000 were prepared in high yields. When WCl4 was dissolved in the reaction with oxygen-containing compounds (e.g. methyl acetate, acetylacetone, acetophenone) before substrate addition, catalyst activity increased significantly. WCl4 in 1,4-dioxane was found to be a very active system for phenylacetylene polymerization; it polymerizes this monomer at the monomer-to-catalyst mole ratio equal to 1000 providing polymer of M ̄ w = 400 000.",
