DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60457-9 ARTICLE Silica-Bonded N-Propylpiperazine Sodium n-Propionate as Recyclable Basic Catalyst for Synthesis of 3,4-Dihydropyrano[c]chromene Derivatives and Biscoumarins Khodabakhsh NIKNAM*, Abbas JAMALI Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Persian Gulf University, Bushehr 75169, Iran Abstract: A simple and efficient procedure for the preparation of silica-bonded N-propylpiperazine sodium n-propionate (SBPPSP) by the hydrolysis of silica-bonded N-propylpiperazine methyl n-propionate (SBPPMP) in hydrochloric acid (0.5 mol/L) followed by treatment with saturated sodium bicarbonate is described. The SBPPMP was obtained by the reaction of 3-silica-bonded N-propylpiperazine and methyl acrylate in methanol. SBPPSP was used as a recyclable basic catalyst for the synthesis of 3,4-dihydropyrano[c]chromenes by the reaction of aromatic aldehydes, malononitrile, and 4-hydroxycoumarin in aqueous ethanol (1:1 v/v) under reflux conditions. Biscoumarins were also obtained via condensation of aldehydes and 4-hydroxycoumarin in aqueous ethanol (1:1 v/v) under reflux conditions. The catalyst could be recycled several times without any additional treatment. Key words: silica-bonded N-propylpiperazine sodium n-propionate; silica-bonded N-propylpiperazine methyl n-propionate; aromatic al- dehydes; 3,4-dihydropyrano[c]chromenes; biscoumarins Multi-component reactions have received considerable at- tention because they are powerful synthetic tools for the syn- thesis of biologically active compounds [1]. In terms of green chemistry, the development and application of mul- ti-component coupling reactions in aqueous media is desirable, as they provide simple and rapid access to a large number of organic molecules through a sustainable path [2]. The elimi- nation of solvents in chemical processes or the replacement of hazardous solvents with relatively benign, clean, cheap, non-flammable, and naturally occurring solvents with high specific heat capacities are primary objectives. Base-catalyzed reactions such as aldol and Knoevenagel condensations and Michael additions are important industrially in the production of drugs, fragrances, and chemical interme- diates [3â€“5]. Conventionally, nearly stoichiometric amounts of homogeneous bases are used for such purposes [3,6,7]. These systems have a number of disadvantages such as tedious iso- lation of products, the corrosive nature of the reaction mixtures, and the formation of large amounts of waste materials. Im- proved synthetic methods in terms of product purity, yield, and minimum waste formation are therefore highly desirable. Moreover, the replacement of liquid acids and bases with the corresponding cleaner solid alternatives with desirable char- acteristics such as being non-stoichiometric, non-corrosive, and reusable is also attractive. The use of solid basic catalysts such as hydrotalcites and basic zeolites has been studied in numerous reactions [8,9]. The potential use of microporous and mesoporous basic catalysts in fine-chemical production is enormous [4], particularly because such catalysts are known to suppress side reactions. Their use also avoids complex neu- tralization and separation steps, and the recovered catalysts can be readily regenerated for further use. Dihydropyrano[c]chromenes and their derivatives are of considerable interest as they possess a wide range of biological properties [10] such as spasmolytic, diuretic, anticoagulant, anticancer, and anti-anaphylactic activities [11,12]. In addition, Khodabakhsh NIKNAM et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1840â€“1849 they can be used as cognitive enhancers for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimerâ€™s disease, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, AIDS-associated dementia, and Downâ€™s syndrome, as well as for the treatment of schizophrenia and myoclonus [13]. Also, a number of 2-amino-4H-pyranes are useful as photoactive materials [14]. A number of methods have been reported for the synthesis of 3,4-dihydropyrano[c]chromenes, e.g., using piperidine in or- ganic solvents, ethanol and pyridine [15], K 2 CO 3 under mi- crowave irradiation [16], diammonium hydrogen phosphate [17], tetrabutylammonium bromide [18], nanostructured ZnO [1], DBU [19], and morpholine [20]. Here we report the synthesis of 3,4-dihydropyrano[c] chromenes and biscoumarins in the presence of SBPPSP as a heterogeneous and recyclable solid basic catalyst. 1 Experimental 1.1 General Chemicals were purchased from Fluka, Merck, and Aldrich Chemical Companies. All the products were characterized by comparison of their infrared (IR), 1 H nuclear magnetic reso- nance (NMR), and 13 C NMR spectra, and their melting points with the reported data [15â€“25]. 3-Piperazine-N-propylsilica (3-PNPS) was prepared according to a previously reported procedure [26]. 1.2 Catalyst preparation 1.2.1 Preparation of silica-bonded N-propylpiperazine methyl N-propionate (SBPPMP) To a magnetically stirred mixture of 3-PNPS (25 g) in MeOH (50 ml), methyl acrylate (25 ml) was added and the mixture was heated at 40â€“50 Â°C for 48 h under nitrogen. The mixture was then filtered and washed with methanol (2 Ã— 50 ml) and dried for 8 h under vacuum to afford SBPPMP as a white powder (26.6 g). Elemental analysis gave the following results: C, H, and N, 13.47%, 2.28%, and 2.18%, respectively. 1.2.2 Preparation of silica-bonded N-propylpiperazine sodium N-propionate (SBPPSP) A magnetically stirred mixture of SBPPMP (26.6 g) was treated with HCl (0.5 mol/L, 50 ml), and then the mixture was filtered and dried overnight under vacuum [26]. The mixture was then treated with a saturated solution of NaHCO 3 (50 ml) for 2 h. The mixture was then filtered and dried overnight under vacuum to afford SBPPSP as a white powder (26.7 g). Ele- mental analysis gave the following results: C, H, and N, 13.72%, 2.30%, and 2.78%, respectively. The pH of SBPPSP, determined using a pH-ISE conductivity titration controller (Denver Instrument Model 270), was 10.82 for 0.1 g of the solid base at 25 Â°C. 1.3 General procedure for synthesis of 3,4-dihydropyrano[c]chromenes To a mixture of 4-hydroxycoumarin (1 mmol) and an aro- matic aldehyde (1 mmol) in aqueous ethanol (5 ml, 1:1 v/v) the SBPPSP catalyst (0.06 g, 5.2 mol%) was added and the mixture was refluxed. After completion of the reaction, as indicated by thin-layer chromatography, the reaction mixture was filtered. The residue was washed with warm ethanol (3 Ã— 30 ml) to separate the heterogeneous catalyst. After cooling, the crude products were precipitated. The crude products were purified by recrystallization from ethanol (95%). The recovered catalyst was dried and reused for subsequent runs. 2-Amino-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-5-oxopyrano[3,2-c]chrome ne-3-carbonitrile (1a). 1 H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d 6 ): Î´ 4.46 (s, 1H), 7.23ï€­7.27 (m, 3H), 7.31ï€­7.35 (m, 2H), 7.43ï€­7.52 (m, 2H), 7.72 (dt, 1H, J 1 = 7.8 Hz, J 2 = 1.6 Hz), 7.92 (dd, 1H, J 1 = 8.0 Hz, J 2 = 0.8 Hz). 13 C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d 6 ): Î´ 58.41, 104.47, 113.42, 117.06, 119.68, 122.98, 125.18, 127.62, 128.10, 129.01, 133.45, 143.80, 152.60, 153.89, 158.36, 158.40, 160.05. 2-Amino-4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-oxopyrano[3,2- c]chromene-3-carbonitrile (1b). 1 H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d 6 ): Î´ 4.49 (s, 1H), 7.31 (d, 2H, J = 8.4 Hz), 7.38 (d, 2H, J = 8.4 Hz), 7.45ï€­7.51 (m, 2H), 7.72 (t, 1H, J = 7.8 Hz), 7.91 (d, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz). 13 C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d 6 ): Î´ 57.94, 103.94, 113.39, 117.06, 119.54, 123.01, 125.18, 128.92, 130.12, 132.18, 133.51, 142.80, 152.64, 154.02, 158.34, 158.38, 160.03. 2-Amino-4-(3-chlorophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-oxopyrano[3,2- c]chromene-3-carbonitrile (1c). 1 H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d 6 ): Î´ 4.52 (s, 1H), 7.26 (d, 1H, J = 7.2 Hz), 7.31ï€­7.38 (m, 3H), 7.47ï€­7.53 (m, 2H), 7.73 (t, 1H, J = 7.6 Hz), 7.91 (d, 1H, J = 7.6 Hz). 13 C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d 6 ): Î´ 57.81, 103.63, 113.43, 117.02, 119.55, 123.06, 125.13, 127.03, 127.66, 128.06, 130.87, 133.48, 133.54, 146.26, 152.66, 154.19, 158.37, 158.42, 160.06. 2-Amino-4-(4-bromophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-oxopyrano[3,2- c]chromene-3-carbonitrile (1d). 1 H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d 6 ): Î´ 4.48 (s, 1H), 7.25 (d, 2H, J = 8.0 Hz), 7.46ï€­7.52 (m, 4H), 7.73 (t, 1H, J = 7.4 Hz), 7.91 (d, 1H, J = 7.6 Hz). 13 C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d 6 ): Î´ 57.85, 103.88, 113.39, 117.08, 119.54, 120.71, 123.02, 125.20, 130.50, 131.85, 133.54, 143.23, 152.65, 154.03, 158.32, 160.04. 2-Amino-4-(3-nitrophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-oxopyrano[3,2-c ]chromene-3-carbonitrile (1e). 1 H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d 6 ): Î´ 4.74 (s, 1H), 7.46ï€­7.53 (m, 2H), 7.58 (s, 2H, NH 2 ), 7.64 (t, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz), 7.74 (dt, 1H, J 1 = 7.9 Hz, J 2 = 1.4 Hz), 7.82 (d, 1H, J = 7.6 Hz), 7.93 (dd, 1H, J 1 = 8.0 Hz, J 2 = 1.2 Hz), 8.12ï€­8.15 (m, 2H). 13 C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d 6 ): Î´ 57.36, Khodabakhsh NIKNAM et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1840â€“1849 103.33, 113.39, 117.07, 119.45, 122.77, 122.93, 123.10, 125.19, 130.56, 133.61, 135.26, 145.96, 148.30, 152.73, 154.35, 158.52, 158.57, 160.10. 2-Amino-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-oxopyrano[3,2-c] chromene-3-carbonitrile (1f). 1 H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d 6 ): Î´ 4.68 (s, 1H), 7.47ï€­7.54 (m, 2H), 7.58ï€­7.61 (m, 2H), 7.75 (dt, 1H, J 1 = 8.0 Hz, J 2 = 1.2 Hz), 7.93 (dd, 1H, J 1 = 8.0 Hz, J 2 = 1.2 Hz), 8.21 (d, 2H, J = 8.4 Hz). 13 C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d 6 ): Î´ 57.20, 103.27, 113.36, 117.13, 119.34, 123.09, 124.22, 125.26, 129.67, 133.69, 147.08, 151.23, 152.74, 154.42, 158.43, 158.47, 160.07. 2-Amino-4-(2-nitrophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-oxopyrano[3,2-c] chromene-3-carbonitrile (1g). 1 H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d 6 ): Î´ 5.25 (s, 1H), 7.46ï€­7.59 (m, 6H), 7.67 (t, 1H, J = 7.6 Hz), 7.73 (t, 1H, J = 7.8 Hz), 7.91 (d, 2H, J = 7.6 Hz). 13 C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d 6 ): Î´ 56.52, 103.75, 113.27, 117.09, 119.22, 123.03, 124.45, 125.21, 128.93, 131.65, 133.57, 134.16, 137.83, 149.66, 152.63, 154.06, 159.08, 160.19.

After completion of the reaction, as indicated by TLC, the reaction mixture was filtered. The remaining was washed with warm ethanol (3 Ã— 30 ml) in order to separate heteroge- neous catalyst. After cooling the crude products were precipi- tated. The crude products were purified by recrystallization from ethanol (95%). The recovered catalyst was dried and reused for subsequent runs. 3,3â€™-(phenylmethylene)-bis-(4-hydroxycoumarin) (4a). 1 H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3 ): Î´ 6.13 (s, 1H), 7.24ï€­7.50 (m, 9H), 7.64ï€­7.68 (m, 2H), 8.02ï€­8.14 (m, 2H), 11.35 (s, 1H, OH), 11.57 (s, 1H, OH). 13 C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl 3 ): Î´ 36.20, 103.90, 105.65, 116.46, 124.42, 124.92, 126.50, 126.90, 128.66, 132.90, 135.21, 152.32, 152.55, 164.62, 165.82, 166.89. 3,3â€™-(4-chlorophenylmethylene)-bis-(4-hydroxycoumarin) (4b). 1 H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3 ): Î´ 6.07 (s, 1H), 7.18 (d, 2H, J = 8.4 Hz), 7.31 (d, 2H, J = 8.8 Hz), 7.39ï€­7.45 (m, 4H), 7.64ï€­7.69 (m, 2H), 8.02 (d, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz), 8.10 (d, 1H, J = 7.8 Hz), 11.35 (s, 1H, OH), 11.57 (s, 1 H, OH). 13 C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl 3 ): Î´ 35.83, 103.71, 105.27, 116.36, 132.74, 133.07, 133.87, 152.30, 152.55, 164.67, 166.04, 166.87, 169.23. 3,3â€™-(4-bromophenylmethylene)-bis-(4-hydroxycoumarin) (4c). 1 H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3 ): Î´ 6.04 (s, 1H), 7.12 (d, 2H, J = 8.4 Hz), 7.39ï€­7.47 (m, 6H), 7.65ï€­7.69 (m, 2H), 8.01ï€­8.10 (m, 2H), 11.35 (s, 1H, OH), 11.56 (s, 1 H, OH). 13 C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl 3 ): Î´ 35.91, 103.65, 105.21, 116.37, 116.71, 116.84, 120.82, 124.44, 125.02, 128.37, 131.73, 133.07, 134.47, 152.30, 152.56, 164.65, 166.05, 166.86, 169.21. 3,3â€™-(4-fluorophenylmethylene)-bis-(4-hydroxycoumarin) (4d). 1 H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3 ): Î´ 6.07 (s, 1H), 7.03 (t, 2H, J = 8.4 Hz), 7.19ï€­7.23 (m, 2H), 7.42ï€­7.44 (m, 4H), 7.64ï€­7.68 (m, 2H), 8.01ï€­8.10 (m, 2H), 11.35 (s, 1H, OH), 11.57 (s, 1H, OH). 13 C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl 3 ): Î´ 35.68, 103.95, 105.49, 115.41, 115.63, 116.39, 116.68, 116.87, 124.41, 124.98, 128.14, 128.22, 130.84, 130.87, 133.01, 152.29, 152.54, 161.72 (d, J C-F = 244.0 Hz), 164.63, 165.93, 166.86, 169.23. 3,3â€™-(3-nitrophenylmethylene)-bis-(4-hydroxycoumarin) (4e). 1 H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3 ): Î´ 6.15 (s, 1H), 7.41-7.48 (m, 4H), 7.54 (t, 1H, J = 7.8 Hz), 7.61 (d, 1H, J = 7.6 Hz), 7.70 (t, 2H, J = 7.8 Hz), 8.02 (d, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz), 8.10ï€­8.13 (m, 2H), 8.17 (d, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz), 11.41 (s, 1H, OH), 11.60 (s, 1 H, OH). 13 C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl 3 ): Î´ 36.20, 103.24, 104.64, 116.29, 116.76, 116.87, 121.79, 122.16, 124.53, 125.17, 125.23, 129.61, 132.81, 133.37, 137.99, 148.76, 152.37, 152.63, Khodabakhsh NIKNAM et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1840â€“1849 164.88, 166.61, 167.00, 169.16. 3,3â€™-(4-nitrophenyl- methylene)-bis-(4-hydroxycoumarin) (4f). 1 H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3 ): Î´ 6.12 (s, 1H), 7.41ï€­7.46 (m, 6H), 7.68 (t, 2H, J = 7.6 Hz), 8.01 (d, 1H, J = 7.6 Hz), 8.10 (d, 1H, J = 7.6 Hz), 8.20 (d, 2H, J = 8.4 Hz), 11.39 (s, 1H, OH), 11.58 (s, 1 H, OH). 13 C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl 3 ): Î´ 36.53, 103.28, 104.77, 116.23, 116.67, 116.75, 116.82, 123.89, 124.47, 124.52, 125.17, 125.24, 127.59, 133.39, 143.38, 146.87, 152.32, 152.57, 164.84, 166.44, 167.01, 169.11. 3,3â€™-(4-cyanophenylmethylene)-bis-(4-hydroxycoumarin) (4g).

SBPPSP was prepared by the reaction of 3-silica-bonded N-propylpiperazine and methyl acrylate in methanol, followed by hydrolysis with HCl (0.5 mol/L) and treatment with saturated sodium bicarbonate (Scheme 1). Elemental analysis gave the following results: C, H, and N, 13.72%, 2.30%, and 2.78%, respectively.

Preparation of SBPPSP. Khodabakhsh NIKNAM et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1840â€“1849 The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of SBPPSP show mass loss of organic materials as they decompose upon heating (Fig. 1). The initial mass loss from the SBPPSP up to 130 Â°C is the result of the removal of physically adsorbed solvent and surface hydroxyl groups. The mass loss of about 19.27% between 150 and 600 Â°C is attributed to the thermal decomposition of organic groups. This mass loss of organic components is equal to 0.87 mmol per g of catalyst. Covalent chemical bonds give the catalyst high thermal stability, so it is possible that the catalyst could be used for high-temperature applications. Figure 2 shows the Fourier-transform IR (FT-IR) spectrum of SBPPSP. The major peaks for silica (SiO 2 ) are broad anti- symmetric Siâ€“Oâ€“Si stretching from 1300 to 1000 cm âˆ’1 and symmetric Siâ€“Oâ€“Si stretching at 820â€“780 cm âˆ’1 . For carboxylate salt functional groups, the FT-IR absorption of the stretching mode is at 1650 cm âˆ’1 . The FT-IR spectrum shows an overlap of the asymmetric and symmetric stretching bands of O=Câ€“O with the Siâ€“Oâ€“Si stretching bands in the silica-functionalized alkyl carboxylate. In the FT-IR spectrum of 3-PNPS, the stretching mode of the carboxylate ester is at 1739.7 cm âˆ’1 , and it disappeared on conversion to a carboxylate salt (not shown). To study the effect of catalyst loading on the synthesis of 2-amino-4-aryl-5-oxo-4H,5H-pyrano[3,2-c]chromene-3-carbo nitrile, the condensation reaction of malononitrile, 4-chlorobenzaldehyde, and 4-hydroxycoumarin was chosen as a model reaction (Table 1). The results clearly show that SBPPSP is an effective catalyst for this condensation, and the optimal amount of SBPPSP was 0.06 g (5.2 mol%) per mmol of aldehyde in refluxing aqueous ethanol (1:1, v/v). This con- densation was carried out with lower amounts of SBPPSP, i.e., 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 M a s s ( % ) (a) 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 M a s s p e r c e n t a g e ( % ) Temperature ( o C) (b) Fig. 1.

This three-component condensation was also accomplished in the presence of SBPPSP in ethanol and water under reflux condi- tions for a longer reaction time (Table 1, entries 1 and 2). The model reaction was also examined under solvent-free condi- tions at 80 Â°C and gave 1b in 51% yield after 60 min (Table 1, entry 8). When the amount of catalyst was increased to 0.08 g and the temperature to 100 Â°C, the yield of 1b increased to 90% (Table 1, entries 9â€“11). The model reaction was performed in the presence of silica-bonded N-propylpiperazine (PNPS) [26] in aqueous ethanol under reflux conditions, giving 80% yield (Table 1, entry 12). In addition, the same model reaction was carried out in the presence of silica-bonded N-propylmorpholine (SBPM) [35] in water and aqueous ethanol (1:1 v/v) for 60 and 90 min, giving yields of 30% and 90%, respectively (Table 1, entries 13 and 14). The synthesis of 2-amino-4-aryl-5-oxo-4H,5H-pyrano[3,2-c] chromene-3-carbonitrile was achieved by the three-component condensation of an aromatic aldehyde, malononitrile, and 4-hydroxycoumarin in the presence of SBPPSP (0.06 g, 5.2 mol%) in aqueous ethanol (1:1 v/v) under reflux conditions (Scheme 2). A series of 3,4-dihydropyrano[c]chromene derivatives were prepared successfully from different aromatic aldehydes bearing electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, 4-hydroxycoumarin, and malononitrile in refluxing aqueous ethanol (1:1 v/v). Compounds bearing electron-withdrawing groups, i.e., 3-nitro-, 4-nitro-, and 2-nitro-benzaldehyde, re- acted under the optimized conditions to give 1e, 1f, and 1g in 94%, 95%, and 91% yields, respectively after 8â€“10 min (Table 2, entries 5â€“7). Compounds bearing electron-donating groups, i.e., 4-Me and 3,4,5-(MeO) 3 -benzaldehyde, were treated with malononitrile and 4-hydroxycoumarin under the optimized conditions and gave 1h and 1i in high yields (Table 2, entries 8 and 9). These results clearly indicate that the reactions can tolerate a wide range of differently substituted aldehydes. Encouraged by these results, we tried to extend the scope of the catalytic activity of SBPPSP to condensation reactions of 4-hydroxycoumarins and aromatic aldehydes to afford bis- coumarin derivatives (Scheme 3).

The con- densation under solvent-free conditions yielded 80% of pure 4b in 40 min. A series of biscoumarins with different sub- stituents were successfully prepared from different aromatic aldehydes bearing electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups and 4-hydroxycoumarin in aqueous ethanol under re- flux conditions. The results are listed in Table 3. A plausible mechanism in the presence of a base, according to Khurana et al. [19], is shown in Scheme 4. The al- pha-cyanocinnamonitrile formed initially by Knoevenagel condensation in the presence of a solid base undergoes sub- sequent reactions with the alpha-hydroxy of 4-hydroxycoumarin in the presence of a solid base to give the desired product. The possibility of recycling the catalyst was examined using the model reaction under the optimized conditions. Upon completion, the reaction mixture was filtered and the remain- ing solid was washed with hot ethanol, dried in air, and the catalyst was reused in the next reaction. The recycled catalyst could be reused five times in the presence of SBPPSP without Table 2 (Continued) Mp ( o C) This work Reported Isolated yield (%) b Time (min) Product Ar Entry 262â€“264 266â€“267 [17] 94 10 1e OO O NH 2 CN NO 23-O 2 N-C 6 H 4 â€“ 5 258â€“260 259â€“261 [17] 95 8 1f OO O NH 2 CN NO 2 4-O 2 N-C 6 H 4 â€“ 6 58â€“260 â€” 91 10 1g OO O NH 2 CN NO 2 2-O 2 N-C 6 H 4 â€“ 7 259â€“260 253â€“255 [20] 90 12 1h OO O NH 2 CN Me 4-Me-C 6 H 4 â€“ 8 236â€“238 â€” 93 12 1i OO O NH 2 CN OMe OMe OMe 3,4,5,-(MeO) 3 -C 6 H 2 â€“ 9 260â€“263 266â€“268 [20] 92 10 1j OO O NH 2 CN OH 4-HO-C 6 H 4 â€“ 10 269â€“270 â€” 93 12 1k OO O NH 2 CN OH3-HO-C6 H 4 â€“ 11 H 2 O/EtOH (1:1, v/v), Reflux 4a-4k O OH O O O Ar 2 O OH OH O Ar-CHO+ 3 SBPPSP Scheme 3.

Tel: +98-771-4541494; Fax: +98-771-4545188 A simple and efficient procedure for the preparation of silica-bonded N-propylpiperazine sodium n-propionate (SBPPSP) by the hydrolysis of silica-bonded N-propylpiperazine methyl n-propionate (SBPPMP) in hydrochloric acid (0.5 mol/L) followed by treatment with saturated sodium bicarbonate is described. The SBPPMP was obtained by the reaction of 3-silica-bonded N-propylpiperazine and methyl acrylate in methanol. SBPPSP was used as a recyclable basic catalyst for the synthesis of 3,4-dihydropyrano[c]chromenes by the reaction of aromatic aldehydes, malononitrile, and 4-hydroxycoumarin in aqueous ethanol (1:1 v/v) under reflux conditions. Biscoumarins were also obtained via condensation of aldehydes and 4-hydroxycoumarin in aqueous ethanol (1:1 v/v) under reflux conditions. The catalyst could be recycled several times without any additional treatment.
