Graphical abstract The development of high-performance transition metal and nitrogen co-doped carbon (M−N−C) catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) hinges on identifying robust and quantitative descriptors for catalytic activity. In this study, we introduce the π-electron delocalization factor (Δπ) in the carbon basal plane as a universal and quantitative descriptor for ORR activity. By combining experimental data and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that Δπ systematically tunes the d-orbital energy levels of MN4 active sites, particularly the d z 2 orbital, which governs the adsorption of oxygen intermediates and influences the rate-determining step of the ORR. A linear correlation between Δπ and ORR kinetics across different metal centers (Fe, Mn, Co, Ni) highlights the pivotal role of π-electron delocalization in optimizing the metal–oxygen interaction. This study provides a novel framework for quantifying catalytic performance and offers an efficient strategy for the rational design and screening of next-generation M−N−C catalysts with enhanced ORR activity.

However, the widespread commercialization of PEMFCs has been hindered by the high cost and scarcity of platinum (Pt)-based catalysts, which are currently used as the benchmark for ORR [3–6]. As a promising alternative, transition metal-nitrogen-carbon (M−N−C) catalysts particularly those with atomically dispersed MN4 sites have attracted considerable attention due to their high catalytic activity, excellent atom utilization, and cost-effectiveness [7–9]. Despite their promising performance in rotating disk electrode (RDE) tests, M−N−C catalysts still fall short under realistic fuel cell conditions, as they struggle to match the activity and durability of Pt catalysts [9–11]. Understanding the origin of ORR activity in M−N−C catalysts is essential to overcoming these limitations [12–15]. Previous studies have predominantly focused on descriptors related to the metal active sites, such as the d-band center,[16,17] redox potential,[8,18–20] electrochemical hardness,[21,22] and adsorption energy of reaction intermediates [23–26]. While these descriptors provide valuable insights, they often fail to account for the critical role that the carbon support plays in modulating the electronic structure and activity of MN4 sites [26–29]. Furthermore, these traditional metal-centered descriptors often do not fully explain the observed variations in ORR performance between MN4 sites embedded in different carbon matrices [30–32]. Recent advancements have demonstrated that FeN4 catalysts can achieve ORR activity comparable to that of platinum by altering the curvature of the carbon plane or precisely tuning the electronic structure of the carbon support [33–35]. Specifically, the distortion and π-electron delocalization of the carbon basal plane plays a crucial role in modulating the d-orbital energy levels of the metal center, which directly influence its ability to adsorb oxygen intermediates during ORR [30,35–38]. These studies have revealed a strong correlation between the π-electron delocalization and the ORR activity in FeN4 systems, with higher delocalization enhancing activity by optimizing the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates [30]. However, the extent to which this phenomenon applies across different metal centers (e.g., Mn, Co, Ni) in M−N−C catalysts remains an open question. Establishing whether this relationship holds universally across various MN4 sites could offer new insights into the design of next-generation ORR catalysts. In this study, we introduce the π-electron delocalization factor (Δπ) as a universal and quantitative descriptor that governs ORR activity in MN4 catalysts. By systematically analyzing the correlation between Δπ and ORR kinetics across a range of metal centers (Fe, Mn, Co, Ni), we establish a linear relationship between Δπ and the catalytic performance of these systems. Our findings reveal that Δπ modulates the d-orbital energy levels of the MN4 sites, particularly the d z 2 orbital, which controls the adsorption strength of oxygen intermediates and alters the rate-determining step of the ORR. This study not only demonstrates that π-electron delocalization is a critical factor in tuning ORR activity, but also provides a robust, universal framework for the design and screening of next-generation M−N−C catalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals Iron(II) phthalocyanine (FePc, AR, Sigma-Aldrich), Manganese phthalocyanine (MnPc, AR, Sigma-Aldrich), Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc, AR, Sigma-Aldrich), Nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc, AR, Sigma-Aldrich), Ketjen black EC600JD carbon black (KJ600, Akzo Nobel), N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF, AR, Macklin), Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2 6H2O, AR, Aldrich), Ferrous chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2 4H2O, AR, Sinopharm), Manganese chloride tetrahydrate (MnCl2 4H2O, AR, Sinopharm), Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2 6H2O, AR, Sinopharm), Nickel chloride (NiCl2, AR, Sinopharm), 2-methylimidazole (AR, Aldrich), Methanol (AR, Sinopharm), Perchloric acid (HClO4, 70 %, Sinopharm), Isopropyl alcohol(IPA, AR, Macklin), and Nafion solution (D520, 5 wt%, Dupont) were used as received. All solutions were prepared with Ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ cm). A 20 % Pt/C catalyst from Johnson Matthey (JM Pt/C) was used as received. 2.2 Synthesis of MPc/C catalysts First, 20 mg metal phthalocyanine (MPc, M = Fe, Mn, Co, and Ni) and 80 mg KJ600 were dissolved in 20 mL DMF, respectively. After ultrasonic treatment at room temperature for 1 h, the two solutions were mixed, ultrasonic treatment for 1 h, stirring for 1 h. The mixtures were then placed in a vacuum drying oven at 100 °C for 1–2 days until the MPc/C catalyst was completely dried. The MPc/C catalysts were heat treated under 5 % H2/Ar to obtain the final products. 2.3 Synthesis of high temperature pyrolytic M−N−C catalysts Typically, 2.2 g of 2-methylimidazole was dissolved in 100 mL of methanol to form a homogeneous transparent solution (Solution A). Separately, 2 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and an appropriate amount of metal salt (with the metal element constituting 20 at% of the total Zn, where M = Fe, Mn, Co, or Ni) were dissolved in 100 mL of methanol to form a uniform Solution B. Solutions A and B were then mixed, sonicated for 10 min, and heated at 60 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the M−ZIF−8 nanocrystals were collected by centrifugation, washed, and dried. The M−ZIF−8 precursor was then heated under an argon atmosphere at 1100 °C (10 °C min−1) for 1 h to obtain the M- and N-codoped carbon (M−N−C) sample. 2.4 Catalysts characterizations Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was performed with Zeiss Merlin Compact. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were performed on a JEM-F200. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-HAADF-STEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images were recorded on a Titan 80–300 scanning/transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV, equipped with a probe spherical aberration corrector. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were characterized by X′Pert PRO X-ray Diffractometer using copper Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Raman measurements were performed on Thermo DXR 2xi. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on with an ESCA LAB 250 spectrometer using Al Kα irradiation. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) was carried out on Agilent 5110. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy was carried out using the RapidXAFS 2 M (Anhui Absorption Spectroscopy Analysis Instrument Co., Ltd.) by transmission (or fluorescence) mode at 20 kV and20 mA, and the Si (531) spherically bent crystal analyzer with a radius of curvature of 500 mm was used for Fe, the Si (551) spherically bent crystal analyzer with a radius of curvature of 500 mm was used for Ni, the Si (440) spherically bent crystal analyzer with a radius of curvature of 500 mm was used for Mn. 2.5 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical experiments were conducted using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E) employing a three-electrode configuration. In this setup, the working electrode was either a rotating disk electrode (RDE) or a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE), the counter electrode was a carbon rod, and the saturated calomel electrode was employed as the reference electrode. All evaluations of H2O2 yield were carried out with the RRDE, while all other assessments utilized the RDE. Throughout this study, all potential values were calibrated with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Prior to testing, a continuous stream of N2 was introduced for a minimum of 30 min to ensure the thorough saturation of the electrolyte with N2. Subsequently, catalyst activation was accomplished by employing cyclic voltammetry (CV) with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Following this, experiments involving the rotating disk electrode (RDE) were conducted at 1600 rpm in O2-saturated electrolytes. For the determination of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves, the data obtained in N2-saturated electrolyte needs to be subtracted from that collected in O2-saturated electrolyte. Similarly, in the case of hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction (HPRR) tests, the LSV curve necessitates subtracting the data from N2-saturated without H2O2 electrolyte from that obtained in N2-saturated electrolyte with H2O2. H2O2 yield tests using RRDE, the potential of the Pt ring was set to 1.2 V vs. RHE so that the diffused H2O2 could be oxidized instantly at the Pt ring electrode. All Square wave-voltammetry (SWV) experiments were performed in N2-saturated electrolytes with a step potential of 4 mV, amplitude of 20 mV, and scan frequency of 2 Hz. The peroxide yield (H2O2%) was calculated using the following equation: (1) H 2 O 2 %= 200 × I r ( I r +N × I d ) where I D is disk current, I R is ring current, and N is current collection efficiency of the Pt ring. N was determined to be 0.37. From the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) equation, we can get the kinetic current density j K. The slope of the linear plot of logarithmic j K to overpotential is the Tafel slope. (2) 1 j = 1 j L + 1 j K where j is the current density from practical measurements, j L and j K are the diffusion limited current density and the kinetic current density, respectively. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Structural Characterizations To gain a better understanding of the ORR process, we prepared model catalysts with explicit MN4 active sites containing various metal species using a simple physical adsorption technique followed by pyrolyzed at low temperature (Fig. 1 a) [8,39–41]. Briefly, metal phthalocyanine (MPc, M = Fe, Mn, Co, and Ni) molecules were loaded onto Ketjen Black-600 (KJ600) and then subjected to 300 °C under 5 % H2/Ar to stabilize the MN4 centers on the carbon support, resulting in the obtained MPc/C products. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of FePc/C catalyst displayed random distribution of carbon particles and rough carbon plane ( Fig. S1 a). The aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-HAADF-STEM) image (Fig. 1 b) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping (Fig. 1 c) of FePc/C catalyst reveal that the metal species are single-atomically dispersed, and C, N, and Fe atoms are evenly distributed. The red region in Fig. S2 b is the selected region, when the electron beam is concentrated in this region, the EELS peaks characteristic of Fe, N, and C could be identified (Fig. 1 d and Fig. S2 c) [42]. As expected, Fig. S3 determines the atomic dispersion of metals in other MPc catalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were used to determine that no metal particles were present (Fig. 1 e and Fig. S4 ) [43,44]. The XRD patterns of pyrolyzed MPc/C catalysts lacked the characteristic diffraction peaks associated with metal clusters. All pyrolyzed MPc/C catalysts exhibited broadened diffraction peaks at approximately 25° and 44°, which were attributed to the diffraction peaks of amorphous carbon. Therefore, the heat treatment procedure did not result in significant structural changes. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the surface composition and electronic states of the pyrolyzed MPc/C catalysts were investigated ( Fig. S6-S9 ) [30,45,46]. The relative content of the pyrrolic-N and the MNx species is depicted in Fig. 1 f-g. The pyrolyzed MPc/C catalysts have a comparable total nitrogen content (∼3.5 at%) ( Table S1 ). The deconvoluted M 2p XPS spectra of MPc/C confirmed the absence of zero-valent metals in the MPc/C catalysts, consistent with the TEM and XRD results. According to Table S2 , the metal mass fraction in each model catalysts is approximately 2.5 wt%, and the atomic ratios of Fe: Mn: Co: Ni in the MPc/C catalysts are 1.14:1.14:1.38:1. 3.2 The π-electron delocalization in the carbon plane and electronic structure of metal sites To validate the structure of the MN4 active sites and quantify the influence of the π-electron delocalization factor (Δπ) in the carbon plane, we employed X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), XPS, and other characterization techniques. These methods provide critical insights into the local electronic environment and structural features of the metal centers in FeN4, MnN4, CoN4, and NiN4 systems. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra (Fig. 2 a and Figs. S10–S13 ) confirmed that the metal centers in all MPc/C catalysts (Fe, Mn, Co, Ni) retain their MNx configuration without forming metal clusters or oxides after pyrolysis. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis further supported the atomic dispersion of MNx sites, showing clear peaks corresponding to the first coordination shell of M−N bonds and the second coordination shell of M−C bonds (Fig. 2 c). Coordination numbers for M−N bonds in all MN4 catalysts were close to 4, consistent with the expected D4h symmetry ( Figs. S10-S13 and Table S3 ) [47,48]. To accurately assess the π-electron delocalization in the carbon plane, we used the full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the C 1 s XPS spectra as a measure of disorder and delocalization in the graphitic carbon [30,35,49]. To account for instrumental discrepancies, we normalized the FWHM using graphene as a standard reference, which has a well-defined FWHM of 0.69 eV ( Fig. S5 ). This normalization enabled the calculation of the Δπ for each system, ensuring cross-sample comparability. The Δπ values for FeN4, MnN4, CoN4, and NiN4 were determined to be 41.3 ± 0.9 %, 37.0 ± 0.5 %, 31.2 ± 0.3 %, and 28.3 ± 0.1 %, respectively (Fig. 2 d). This approach provides a consistent and quantitative measure of the delocalization of π-electrons across different MN4 catalysts, establishing Δπ as a universal descriptor of the carbon matrix's electronic structure. Further, the valency of the metal center is determined by linear fitting of the absorption edge of the XANES curves (Fig. 2 b), Fig. 2 e reveals a linear relationship between Δπ and the oxidation state of the metal centers [50]. For FeN4, the increase in Δπ stabilized the Fe center in the Fe3+ state (average oxidation state of 2.87), indicating that the electron-withdrawing effect from the carbon plane intensifies as π-electron delocalization increases. This trend was consistent across all metals: Mn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ exhibited average oxidation states of 2.63, 1.80, and 1.77, respectively, as Δπ increased ( Figs. S10-S13 ). This linear relationship highlights the critical role of π-electron delocalization in controlling the electron density at the metal centers, promoting higher oxidation states through the electron-withdrawing effects of the carbon matrix. A schematic in Fig. 2 f illustrates how the Δπ modulates the d-orbital energy levels of the metal centers, particularly the eg orbitals, such as the dz 2 orbital, which are critical for bonding interactions with oxygen intermediates. As Δπ increases in the carbon plane connected to the M−N4 sites, the electron density of the dz2 orbital at the metal center decreases, favoring the formation of higher oxidation states (e.g., Fe3+, Mn3+). This change in metal valence optimizes the interaction between the metal center and the ORR intermediates, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity for the ORR. The modulation of the d-orbital energy levels through the carbon support provides a mechanistic basis for the observed linear relationship between Δπ and the oxidation states of the metal centers. Overall, the use of Δπ as a descriptor offers a quantitative framework for understanding and controlling the electronic interactions between the carbon matrix and metal centers in MN4 catalysts. Our results highlight the critical role of the carbon support’s π-electron system in tuning the metal center's oxidation state and electronic structure, providing a clear mechanism for modulating catalytic properties across different transition metal systems. 3.3 The π-electron delocalization in the carbon plane and ORR activity We then explore how the Δπ in the carbon plane influences the redox potential of the metal centers (Fe, Mn, Co, Ni) and how this modulation affects the ORR activity. This systematic investigation highlights the critical role of the carbon support's electronic structure in controlling metal reactivity and optimizing catalytic performance. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV) measurements for the MPc/C catalysts (Figs. 3 a and S14 ) reveal distinct redox potentials (E redox) for each metal system in a N2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte. The E redox values follow the order: MnN4 < FeN4 < CoN4 < NiN4, reflecting the inherent differences in the electronic structure and d-orbital configuration of the metal centers [19]. As shown in Fig. 3 b, the redox potential exhibits a volcano-shaped relationship with Δπ across the MN4 catalysts. For FeN4 and MnN4, increasing Δπ results in a positive shift in E redox, indicating that the electron-withdrawing capability of the carbon plane lowers the d-orbital electron density at the metal center, making the redox process more favorable. On the other side of the volcano, CoN4 and NiN4 show an inverse trend, where decreasing Δπ also leads to a positive shift in E redox, reflecting the different electronic requirements for these more filled d-orbital systems (e.g., Co2+, Ni2+). The π-electron delocalization in the carbon plane systematically modulates the electron density in the d-orbitals of the metal centers, particularly the d z 2 orbital, which is crucial for axial bonding and electron transfer during redox reactions [16,51]. When Δπ increases, the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbon matrix intensifies, reducing the electron density at the metal center [30]. This downshift in the d-orbital energy levels facilitates electron transfer, particularly for Fe and Mn, where the redox potential becomes more favorable for ORR as the metal center transitions more easily between oxidation states (e.g., Fe2+/Fe3+ or Mn2+/Mn3+). In contrast, for Co and Ni, which have more filled d-orbitals, a decrease in Δπ (i.e., a less electron-withdrawing carbon plane) leads to better electron transfer and a more favorable redox process, as these metals are less sensitive to electron withdrawal due to their filled d-electron configuration. Fig. 3 c presents the Tafel plots for the ORR activity of the MN4 catalysts in an O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte, with kinetic current density (j K) at 0.6 V providing a measure of ORR performance [52]. The ORR activity follows the order: FeN4 (8.47 mA cm−2) > MnN4 (1.05 mA cm−2) > CoN4 (1.02 mA cm−2) > NiN4 (0.04 mA cm−2). A volcano-shaped correlation between ORR activity and E redox is observed ( Fig. S15 ), indicating that optimal ORR performance is achieved when the metal center reaches a balance between electron donation and electron withdrawal [19]. On the left side of the volcano, FeN4 and MnN4 exhibit stronger adsorption of oxygen intermediates (O2, OH*, OOH*) due to their higher redox potentials. However, overly strong adsorption can hinder intermediate desorption and lower ORR kinetics, as observed in MnN4. On the right side, CoN4 and NiN4 exhibit weaker oxygen adsorption due to their lower redox potentials, limiting their ORR activity. However, CoN4, being closer to the peak of the volcano, strikes a balance between electron transfer and desorption, resulting in reasonable ORR activity compared to NiN4. To further investigate how Δπ modulates ORR kinetics, we performed hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction (HPRR) measurements by adding 1.3 mM H2O2 to the N2-saturated electrolyte (Fig. 3 d) [2,24,53,54]. As shown in Fig. 3 e, a linear correlation between Δπ and both ORR and HPRR activities is observed, suggesting that the π-electron delocalization factor directly governs the catalytic kinetics at MN4 sites. As Δπ increases, the electron-withdrawing capability of the carbon plane improves, weakening the over-adsorption of ORR intermediates and resulting in more efficient catalytic cycles. For FeN4 and MnN4, the increased Δπ allows for a better balance between intermediate adsorption and desorption, significantly enhancing their ORR performance. For CoN4 and NiN4, while Δπ still improves ORR kinetics, the effect is less pronounced due to the more filled d-orbital configurations of these metals, making them less responsive to changes in π-electron delocalization. Fig. 3 f schematically illustrates how Δπ modulates the d-orbital energy levels of the metal centers, particularly the d z 2 orbital, which interacts with ORR intermediates [36,43]. For FeN4 and MnN4, increasing Δπ reduces the d z 2 orbital energy, weakening the interaction with oxygen intermediates and optimizing the adsorption/desorption balance, resulting in higher ORR activity. In contrast, CoN4 and NiN4, with more filled d-orbitals, experience a smaller impact on their ORR performance as Δπ increases. This illustrates that the response of each metal center to π-electron delocalization varies depending on the d-electron configuration, with Fe and Mn showing more significant activity improvements than Co and Ni. Lastly, Fig. 3 g demonstrates the universal trend where increasing Δπ enhances ORR kinetics across different MN4 catalysts, whether the metal sites are classified as strong binding (FeN4, MnN4) or weak binding (CoN4, NiN4). For FeN4 and MnN4, increasing Δπ reduces the overbinding of oxygen intermediates, improving ORR efficiency. For CoN4 and NiN4, the increased metal–oxygen interaction due to higher Δπ enhances ORR kinetics. This linear relationship highlights the potential of Δπ as a universal descriptor for optimizing the interaction between metal centers and oxygen intermediates, offering a powerful strategy for improving catalytic performance across various metal systems. 3.4 DFT calculations To further investigate the origin of ORR activity in MN4-based catalysts, we conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations to analyze how the Δπ in the carbon plane modulates the electronic structure of the metal centers and affects the ORR kinetics. These simulations allowed us to quantify the interaction between the metal centers and the carbon support and its influence on the rate-determining step (RDS) in ORR. The initial step in our modeling involved embedding the MN4 configuration into a graphene plane to simulate the interaction between the carbon support and the metal center ( Fig. S18 ). This setup accurately reflects how the π-electron delocalization within the carbon basal plane alters the electronic environment of the MN4 active sites (Fe, Mn, Co, Ni). The charge density difference plot (Fig. 4 a) revealed significant charge transfer from the carbon plane to the MN4 center, with the metal centers receiving 2.3 e−, 2.4 e−, 2.2 e−, and 2.0 e− for Mn-N-C, Fe-N-C, Co-N-C, and Ni-N-C, respectively. This charge transfer is a direct consequence of the π-electron delocalization, which controls the electron density at the MN4 sites and enhances the electron donation from the carbon matrix. Projected density of states (pDOS) analysis (Fig. 4 b) demonstrated how this charge transfer affects the orbital interactions between the metal centers and the oxygen intermediates during ORR [16,51]. Specifically, the electron transfer primarily occurs between the metal’s d z 2 orbital and the 2p z orbital of the adsorbed O2 molecule, facilitating O2 activation. A larger d-band center gap corresponds to stronger orbital hybridization between the d z 2 orbital of the metal center and the 2p z orbital of O2, which accelerates the ORR process by enhancing the interaction between the metal center and the oxygen intermediates. The calculated d-band center gaps for Mn-N-C, Fe-N-C, Co-N-C, and Ni-N-C were 2.67, 1.81, 0.59, and 0.01 eV, respectively (Fig. 4 c). We observed a volcano-shaped relationship between the d-band center gap and the amount of electron donation from the carbon plane to the MN4 site, where larger d-band center gaps are associated with stronger orbital hybridization and more efficient O2 activation. This demonstrates that Δπ plays a critical role in tuning the d-band center, optimizing the interaction between metal centers and oxygen intermediates, and accelerating ORR kinetics. The larger the d-band center gap, the more efficient the electron transfer between the metal center and the adsorbed O2, improving the catalytic turnover rate. The free energy diagrams for ORR in acidic media (Supplementary Information, Section 2) provide additional insights into the thermodynamics of each metal center’s catalytic performance (Fig. 4 e) [52,55,56]. For Fe-N-C, Co-N-C, and Ni-N-C, the RDS occurs in the initial phase, with free energy values (ΔG) of − 0.41 eV, −0.21 eV, and − 0.05 eV, respectively. In contrast, for Mn-N-C, the RDS occurs in the third step with a ΔG of − 0.73 eV. The overpotentials for ORR at 0 V (Fig. 4 d) indicate that Fe-N-C has the lowest overpotential (0.82 V), followed by Mn-N-C (0.87 V), Co-N-C (1.02 V), and Ni-N-C (1.28 V). These results, consistent with our experimental findings, confirm that Fe-N-C exhibits the highest catalytic activity for ORR. A strong linear correlation (R2 = 0.97) was found between electron donation from the carbon support (as influenced by Δπ) and the ORR overpotential (Fig. 4 d). This correlation demonstrates that the electron-donating properties of the carbon plane, driven by π-electron delocalization, directly govern the adsorption strength of oxygen-containing species at the MN4 sites and, consequently, the overall catalytic performance. Higher levels of electron donation from the carbon support lower the overpotential for ORR, facilitating more efficient oxygen reduction. These theoretical results underscore the importance of π-electron delocalization as a universal descriptor for modulating the electronic environment of MN4 catalysts. By systematically tuning Δπ, we can control the d-orbital energy levels, the interaction with oxygen intermediates, and the overall ORR performance across different metal centers. This finding provides a clear framework for designing and optimizing next-generation M−N−C catalysts by leveraging the electron transfer properties of the carbon matrix. 3.5 The generality of Δπ as descriptor In the above discussion, we demonstrated that Δπ can serve as an experimental descriptor for ORR activity. However, the substantial performance disparity observed between FePc and Fe-N-C catalysts pyrolyzed at high temperatures raises questions about the robustness of this descriptor. To further validate Δπ, we selected Fe-N-C catalyst derived from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs)—which is known for their superior ORR performance within the Fe-N-C family. We also synthesized other M−N−C catalysts (M = Mn, Co, Ni) using a similar one-pot post-pyrolysis method, as shown in Fig. 5 a. XRD and AC-HAADF-STEM analysis confirmed that no metal particles were present in the pyrolyzed M−N−C catalysts. Additionally, Fe atoms in the Fe-N-C catalyst were found to be atomically dispersed in the carbon matrix as single atoms (Figs. 5 b and S20 ). To assess the validity of Δπ as a descriptor for ORR activity, we employed XPS and RDE techniques. The degree of delocalization of the graphite ligands in the carbon-based catalysts was analyzed via XPS, and the delocalization of the graphite ligands (Δπ) in Fe-N-C, Mn-N-C, Co-N-C, and Ni-N-C catalysts was derived from the deconvolved C1s spectra: 78.3 %, 68.1 %, 71.0 %, and 65.2 %, respectively (Figs. 5 c and S21 ). The ORR polarization curves of the M−N−C catalysts are presented in Fig. S22 . The Tafel slopes for Fe-N-C, Mn-N-C, Co-N-C, and Ni-N-C are 60.5, 80.1, 68.0, and 98.1 mV, respectively, with corresponding j K values at 0.8 V of 2.97, 0.35, 0.46, and 0.075 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5 d). The Fe-N-C catalyst demonstrates the highest ORR kinetic rate, followed by Co-N-C, Mn-N-C, and Ni-N-C. Fig. 5 e reveals an excellent linear relationship between Δπ and the ORR activity, with an R2 value greater than 0.95, further validating the universality of Δπ as an experimental descriptor for ORR activity. 4 Conclusion In this work, we have demonstrated that the Δπ plays a pivotal role in modulating the electronic structure and catalytic activity of MN4-based catalysts for the ORR. By establishing Δπ as a quantitative descriptor, we provided a unified framework to explain how the carbon plane’s electronic structure influences the redox potential, oxidation state, and ORR kinetics across a range of transition metal centers (Fe, Mn, Co, Ni). Our experimental and theoretical investigations revealed a linear correlation between Δπ and the oxidation states of the metal centers, showing that increased π-electron delocalization strengthens the electron-withdrawing capacity of the carbon plane, stabilizing higher oxidation states for metals like Fe and Mn. This electronic modulation affects the metal's redox potential and interaction with oxygen intermediates, enhancing ORR kinetics by optimizing the balance between adsorption and desorption of ORR intermediates. Furthermore, DFT calculations showed that Δπ systematically tunes the d-orbital energy levels, particularly the d z 2 orbital, which is crucial for the interaction with oxygen species. The correlation between the d-band center gap and electron donation from the carbon plane demonstrates that a higher Δπ value facilitates stronger orbital hybridization, improving O2 activation and reducing ORR overpotentials. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of how the carbon matrix’s electronic structure modulates the catalytic performance of MN4 sites. Importantly, we observed a universal trend across different metals, where increasing Δπ linearly enhances ORR activity, making it a powerful tool for catalyst design. However, the impact of Δπ is less pronounced for CoN4 and NiN4 due to their more filled d-orbital configurations, highlighting the limitations of these systems. Despite this, our work establishes Δπ as a universal and predictive descriptor for tuning the electronic environment of MN4 sites, providing a new pathway for the rational design and rapid screening of high-performance, non-precious metal ORR catalysts. In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive framework that links the π-electron delocalization in the carbon plane to the catalytic behavior of MN4-based catalysts, offering valuable insights for the future design of advanced ORR catalysts. The use of Δπ enables precise control over the electronic structure of MN4 sites, paving the way for the development of next-generation electrocatalysts with optimized performance.

        "dc:description": "The development of high-performance transition metal and nitrogen co-doped carbon (M−N−C) catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) hinges on identifying robust and quantitative descriptors for catalytic activity. In this study, we introduce the π-electron delocalization factor (Δπ) in the carbon basal plane as a universal and quantitative descriptor for ORR activity. By combining experimental data and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that Δπ systematically tunes the d-orbital energy levels of MN4 active sites, particularly the d z 2 orbital, which governs the adsorption of oxygen intermediates and influences the rate-determining step of the ORR. A linear correlation between Δπ and ORR kinetics across different metal centers (Fe, Mn, Co, Ni) highlights the pivotal role of π-electron delocalization in optimizing the metal–oxygen interaction. This study provides a novel framework for quantifying catalytic performance and offers an efficient strategy for the rational design and screening of next-generation M−N−C catalysts with enhanced ORR activity.",
