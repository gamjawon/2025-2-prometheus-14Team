DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60359-8 REVIEW Development of Ni-Based Catalysts for Steam Reforming of Tar Derived from Biomass Pyrolysis Dalin LI 1,2 , Yoshinao NAKAGAWA 1 , Keiichi TOMISHIGE 1, * 1 Department of Applied Chemistry, School of Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8579, Japan 2 National Engineering Research Center of Chemical Fertilizer Catalyst, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, China Abstract: Nickel catalysts are effective for the steam reforming of tar derived from biomass pyrolysis, but the improvement is needed in terms of activity, stability, suppression of coke deposition and aggregation, and regeneration. Our recent development of Ni-based catalysts for the steam reforming of tar is reviewed including the modification with CeO 2 (or MnO), trace Pt, and MgO. The role of additives such as CeO 2 , MnO, Pt, and MgO is also discussed. Key words: steam reforming; tar; biomass; nickel; ceria; manganese oxide; platinum; magnesia Conversion of biomass to synthesis gas and hydrogen is one of the important technologies for the energy utilization of biomass by the power generation and the production of liquid fuels by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and chemicals by methanol synthesis [14]. The gasification of biomass to synthesis gas and hydrogen has been conventionally carried out in a non-catalytic system at very high temperature (> 1073 K) in order to decrease the concentration of the residual tar [4]. In the non-catalytic gasification, air is usually used as a gasifying agent. Therefore, the product gas is diluted with nitrogen and this makes the product gas unsuitable to the chemical conver- sion. Another gasification method is the catalytic steam re- forming of tar derived from the pyrolysis of biomass at much lower temperature than the case of non-catalytic gasification with air. It has been known that rapid pyrolysis at low tem- perature such as 773 K gives high yield of the mixture of volatile organic compounds, which is called as tar or bio-oil. When steam reforming reaction of the tar can proceed at low temperature comparable to the case of the pyrolysis, the com- bination of the rapid pyrolysis and catalytic steam reforming will enable the low-temperature gasification of biomass to synthesis gas and hydrogen. In the steam reforming of tar, catalysts with high perform- ance in terms of the activity and stability are needed. More- over, it is considered that high abilities in the catalyst activa- tion and the catalyst regeneration are important properties in the process for the biomass conversion to synthesis gas and hydrogen. If the catalysts can be activated automatically by the introduction of the biomass tar at the reaction temperature, this self-activation property can contribute to the easier opera- tion of the process. On the other hand, the coke deposited on the catalysts can be reduced to some extent, but the complete suppression is difficult. The coke removal such as by the combustion is necessary. However, the procedure for the coke removal can cause the catalyst deactivation by the sintering of a support material and the aggregation of metal particles. If the catalysts are recyclable by the re-dispersion of the aggre- gated particles, the catalyst cost can be decreased. The self-activation and self-regeneration properties as well as high steam reforming activity and the suppression of coke forma- tion can contribute to the development of more feasible proc- ess. Applicability of the commercial and conventional steam reforming catalysts has been evaluated [510]. However, in fact, the performance of the conventional catalysts is not sat- isfactory, and the development of the catalysts for the steam reforming of tar derived from the biomass pyrolysis is highly needed. Table 1 lists the examples of recent reports on Ni catalysts for the tar conversion in the gasification of real biomass. A nano-NiO/ -Al 2 O 3 catalyst was reported by Li et al. [11] to Dalin LI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 583â€“594 show high activity in cracking of tar and hydrocarbons. An- other nano-Ni-La-Fe/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was also developed by Li et al. [12]. In the presence of the catalyst, the tar remove effi- ciency reached 99% at 1073 K, and the coke deposition and sintering effects were avoided, leading to a long lifetime of catalysts. Wang et al. [13] reported a NiO-MgO catalyst ex- hibiting high stable activity for the reforming of raw fuel gas from gasifier. The highly stable activity was attributed to the high dispersion of Ni particles in the NiO-MgO solid solution structure and the promotion by catalyst reducibility. Recently, Le et al. [14] developed a Ni-loaded brown coal char for the steam reforming of tar. Compared to conventional Ni/Al 2 O 3 , Ni-loaded brown coal char has a higher activity and stability with coke resistance [15]. It was also reported by Wang et al. [16] that coal char supported Ni and wool char supported Ni catalysts are effective for tar removal, converting more than 97% of tars in synthesis gas at 1073 K. Corujo et al. [17] re- ported that the use of NiO-loaded calcined dolomite catalysts led to a reduction in the formation rate of tar and char and a 30% increase in the total product gas. As listed in Table 1, the amount of catalysts was rather large in most cases. This large amount of catalysts needed for the activity tests makes it dif- ficult to optimize the catalyst composition, the preparation method, pre-treatment conditions, and so on. In fact, the number of the tested catalysts in most cases is so limited. On the other hand, in our case, the reactor size is rather small, and only 1 g catalyst is needed, then various catalysts can be eas- ily tested and this enables the development of the catalysts tuned for the catalytic gasification of biomass [1825] and the steam reforming of the biomass tar [2634]. On the other hand, addition of secondary metal or metal oxide is a promising approach for tuning or design new cata- lysts. In this approach, the optimum amount of the additives is usually present. For example, in the case of metal catalysts modified with oxides and secondary metals, the interface be- tween metal and the modifier can be a catalytically active site, and the amount of the interface has a maximum with respect to the additive amount of the modifier, such as Rh-M/MgO (M = Co, Ni, Fe) catalysts for the catalytic partial oxidation of methane [3537], Rh-MO x (M = Mo, Re) catalysts for the hydrogenolysis of biomass-derived polyols and cyclic ethers [3842], Pt-ReO x catalysts for the preferential CO oxidation in a H 2 -rich stream [43,44], and so on. It has been known that Ni is one of the suitable components for the steam reforming of various organic compounds, and the effects of supports and additive oxides and other metals have been investigated. Our group has reported that the addition of CeO 2 [27,28] and MnO [32] to Ni catalysts enhanced the catalytic performance in terms of the activity and the suppression of coke formation in the steam reforming of the biomass tar. In particular, the sup- pression of coke formation is related to the catalyst stability. We also attempted to attach the self-activation and self-regeneration properties to Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalysts by modification with a small amount of Pt and MgO [2931]. This review article shows the development process of Ni/Al 2 O 3 modified with CeO 2 , Pt, and MgO in order to make the multi-functional catalyst for the steam reforming of tar derived from the wood pyrolysis. 1 Steam reforming of tar over Ni catalysts supported on different oxides [26] Ni catalysts supported on various oxides, i.e., Ni/Al 2 O 3 , Ni/ZrO 2 , Ni/TiO 2 , Ni/CeO 2 , and Ni/MgO were prepared by the Table 1 Recent reports on Ni catalysts for biomass gasification Biomass Catalyst Ni content (wt%) Catalyst amount (g) Reactor (diameter Ã— height, mm) Ref.

The method for the preparation of the support materials were described in our previous report [26]. The cal- cination conditions for the preparation of the supports are listed in Table 2. It should be noted that all the alumina supports in this review were -Al 2 O 3 . After impregnation, the sample was dried at 383 K for 12 h followed by calcination at 773 K for 3 h under air atmosphere. The loading amount of Ni is described in parentheses as mass percent on all the catalysts. Cedar wood was used as the biomass feedstock for all experiments. Steam reforming of tar was carried out in a laboratory-scale continuous feeding dual-bed reactor [26]. In this system, tar is formed by the rapid pyrolysis of cedar wood in the presence of steam, and it is introduced to the secondary catalyst bed together with steam. Before catalytic reaction, the catalyst was pre-reduced in H 2 at 773 K for 0.5 h. Table 3 summarizes the results of various supported Ni catalysts in steam reforming of tar at 823 K together with that in the absence of catalyst. Without catalyst, the tar yield was rather high and the formation rates of CO and H 2 were quite low. On the other hand, when Ni catalysts were used, the yield of tar decreased and the formation rate of gaseous products, especially H 2 , increased drastically compared to the case of no catalyst. This result indicates that Ni catalysts are effective for the conversion of tar to useful gases such as CO and hydrogen. It should be noted that the catalytic performance was strongly dependent on support materials. Figure 1(a) compares the yields of the residual tar and coke in steam reforming of tar at 823 K over various Ni catalysts. In terms of the residual tar yield, the order of the activity at 823 K was as follows: Ni/Al 2 O 3 > Ni/ZrO 2 > Ni/TiO 2 > Ni/CeO 2 > Ni/MgO > no catalyst. The amount of H 2 adsorption listed in Table 2 explains the order of the steam reforming activity. Low activity of Ni/MgO is also affected by low reduction degree of Ni species. On the other hand, the coke yield was in the order: Ni/TiO 2 > Ni/Al 2 O 3 > Ni/MgO > Ni/ZrO 2 > Ni/CeO 2 , which cannot be explained by the amount of H 2 adsorption, and this suggests that the function of the support oxide is very impor- tant. The tar and coke yields on various Ni catalysts are plotted in Fig. 1(d). The coke deposited on the catalyst can be formed by the decomposition of tar and the disproportionation of CO as a product of steam reforming. When the coke yield increases with decreasing the tar yield, it is thought that the coke is mainly formed by the decomposition of tar. However, in fact, the relation between tar and coke yields was complex, sug- gesting that the coke is also formed by the CO disproportiona- tion. In contrast, the relation between the formation rate of CO + H 2 + 4CH 4 and the yield of tar + coke (Fig. 1(b)) is clear, and low yield of tar + coke is connected to higher formation rate of the combustible gases. It is concluded that the catalyst with high steam reforming activity and the suppression of coke formation is directly connected to the efficient production of Table 2 Properties of Ni catalysts supported on different oxides [26] Calcination conditions Particle size of Ni metal (nm) Catalyst Temperature (K) Time (h) BET surface area (m 2 /g cat ) H 2 adsorption b (10 6 mol/g cat ) Reduction degree from TPR c (%) Dispersion d (%) H 2 adsorption e XRD f Ni(12)/Al 2 O 3 1423 1 8 27 106 2.7 36 31 Ni(12)/ZrO 2 1073 3 10 30 96 3.0 31 29 Ni(12)/TiO 2 1173 3 16 28 97 2.8 34 21 Ni(12)/CeO 2 1073 3 12 17 106 1.7 56 58 Ni(12)/MgO ? a 12 3 20 1.5 64 n.d. a MgO support was used without precalcination. b H 2 adsorption is total adsorption at room temperature, and H/Ni = 1 is assumed. c Calculated by (H 2 consumption in TPR profiles)/(loading amount of Ni) Ã— 100%, assuming that Ni 2+ + H 2 Ni 0 + 2H + . d Dispersion calculated by 2 Ã— (H 2 adsorption)/(loading amount of Ni)/(reduction degree) Ã— 100% [45,46]. e Particle size of Ni metal calculated by the relation: (particle size/nm) = 9.71/(dispersion/%) Ã— 10 [45,46]. f Particle size of Ni metal calculated from the Scherrer equation, using the full width at half height of the strong intensity metal peak.

Dalin LI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 583â€“594 synthesis gas. Figure 2 shows the TPR profiles of various Ni catalysts. The reduction degree estimated from the results of H 2 consumption in TPR profiles is listed in Table 2. Except for Ni/MgO, the reduction degree of Ni was almost 100% and this indicates that all the Ni was reduced at about 800 K. On the other hand, the reduction degree of Ni/MgO was only about 20%. This can be because the strong interaction between NiO and MgO decreases catalyst reducibility [4749]. An important point is that the reduction profile of Ni is strongly influenced by the support oxides, and Ni species on CeO 2 showed high reduci- bility. The similar behavior was also observed in the case of Rh-CeO 2 catalysts [50]. To investigate the catalyst ability for coke removal, we measured the reactivity of coke with catalysts using active carbon as a model compound of coke by means of thermogra- vimetric analysis (TGA). Figure 3 shows the TGA profiles of active carbon + catalyst in 5% steam/N 2 . Compared to no catalyst, the presence of catalysts promoted steam gasification of active carbon. In particular, Ni/CeO 2 was more effective than the other catalysts. The promotion of reaction between steam and active carbon can cause low coke yield in steam reforming of tar over Ni/CeO 2 . This property is due to high redox property of Ce species, and reduction and oxidation of Ce species proceed in the presence of steam and tar [50]. 2 Steam reforming of tar over Ni/CeO2/Al2O3 catalysts [27,28] As mentioned above, the interaction of Ni and CeO 2 gave high reducibility of Ni species and the suppression of coke formation. Therefore, the additive effect of CeO 2 to Ni/Al 2 O 3 was investigated, and in particular, the relation between the Ni-CeO 2 interaction and catalytic performance in the steam reforming of tar was clarified. Two types of Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalysts were prepared by the co-impregnation (CI) and se- (a) (b) Fig. 1.

In co-impregnation, the Al 2 O 3 was impregnated with an aqueous solution of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 Â·6H 2 O and Ce(NH 4 ) 2 (NO 3 ) 6 , followed by drying and calcination at 773 K for 3 h. In sequential impregnation, the Al 2 O 3 was impregnated with Ce(NH 4 ) 2 (NO 3 ) 6 solution, fol- lowed by drying and calcination at 773 K for 3 h, and then impregnated with Ni(NO 3 ) 2 ç„’ 6H 2 O solution, followed by dry- ing and calcination at 773 K for 3 h. The loading amounts of Ni and CeO 2 are described in parentheses as mass percent on all the catalysts. Figure 4 shows the catalytic performances of Ni/CeO 2 / Al 2 O 3 catalysts in steam reforming of tar at 823 K. On 4 wt% Ni catalysts, Ni(4)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 (CI) exhibited higher ac- tivity than Ni(4)/Al 2 O 3 and Ni(4)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 (SI) cata- lysts, and at the same time, Ni(4)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 (CI) also showed higher resistance to coke formation. Similar tendency was also observed on 12 wt% Ni catalysts. These results demonstrate that the co-impregnation is an effective prepara- tion method for Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 . Figure 5 shows TPR profiles of Ni/Al 2 O 3 and Ni/CeO 2 / Al 2 O 3 catalysts. On Ni(4)/Al 2 O 3 , the H 2 consumption was observed in the temperature range between 630 and 850 K. In the presence of CeO 2 , the peak of H 2 consumption was shifted to lower temperature. The shift on Ni(4)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 (CI) was more significant than that on Ni(4)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 (SI). A similar phenomenon was also observed on the 12 wt% Ni catalysts. The lower temperature shift of H 2 consumption peak by the addition of CeO 2 can be explained by the interaction between Ni species and CeO 2 . The larger shift on Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 (CI) than that on Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 (SI) can be interpreted by the stronger interaction between Ni and CeO 2 introduced by the co-impregnation method. Another important point is that the Ni-based reduction degree on the CI catalysts is higher than that on the SI catalysts, and especially, the re- duction degree of Ni(4)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 (CI) was high (Table 4). Assuming that the CeO 2 around Ni can be reduced more easily, these results also support the stronger interaction be- tween Ni and CeO 2 on Ni(4)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 (CI). The char- acterization by TEM and EXAFS analysis showed that the particle size of Ni over Ni(4)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 (CI) was smaller than those over Ni(4)/Al 2 O 3 and Ni(4)/CeO 2 (30)/ Al 2 O 3 (SI) [28].

Dalin LI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 583â€“594 Ni(4)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 (CI) was a little smaller than those on the other two catalysts (Table 4). The inconsistence between the results of TEM and EXAFS and that of H 2 adsorption can be explained by covering Ni with CeO 2 over Ni(4)/ CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 (CI), which also supports that the strong in- teraction between Ni and CeO 2 can be realized by the co-impregnation method. According to the catalyst charac- terization, the particle size of Ni metal and CeO 2 was about 7 and 8 nm, respectively [28], and the TEM image suggests that 100 nm Ni-CeO 2 nanocomposite consisted of 78 nm Ni metal and CeO 2 particles. The formation of nanocomposite enables large interface of Ni-CeO 2 . This property can be related to the excellent performance in steam reforming of tar. It is sug- gested that CeO 2 can supply oxygen atom to the adsorbed species on Ni metal surface at the interface. The carbonaceous reaction intermediate species adsorbed on Ni metal surface can react with oxygen atom supplied from neighboring CeO 2 , resulting in high catalytic activity and low coke formation. The role of the interface between Ni and CeO 2 is illustrated in Fig. 6. 3 Steam reforming of tar over Ni/CeO2/Al2O3 modified with noble metals [29,30] It has been reported that the modification of Ni catalysts for steam reforming of hydrocarbons with a small amount of no- ble metals enhances the catalytic performance remarkably from the aspects of activity, suppression of coke formation, catalyst reducibility, catalyst activation, and so on [5162]. Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ru were loaded on Ni(4)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 (CI) using an aqueous solution of Pt(NO 2 ) 2 (NH 3 ) 2 , Pd(NO 3 ) 2 , Rh(NO 3 ) 3 , and Ru(NO)(NO 3 ) 3 , respectively [29,30]. After impregnation, the sample was dried, followed by calcination at 773 K for 3 h. The loading amount of each component is described in parentheses as mass percent on all the catalysts. Figure 7 shows the catalytic performances of noble metal-modified Ni(4)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 catalysts in steam re- forming of tar at 823 K. Here, the catalysts without H 2 reduc- tion were compared in order to evaluate the effect of noble metals on the self-activation. The modification by noble metals improved the catalytic activity. Among noble metals investi- gated, Pt was the most effective. On Pt(0.1)/Ni(4)/ CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 , the tar yield was almost zero. This perform- ance is higher than that of Ni(4)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 with reduc- tion pretreatment (Fig. 4). The promoting effect of Pt was so significant that the addition of a very small amount of Pt such as 0.01 wt% to the Ni(4)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 catalyst also en- hanced the performance drastically. We have verified that Pt(0.1)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 showed much lower performance than Ni(4)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 and Pt(0.1)/Ni(4)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 [30]. Therefore, the activity of Pt/Ni(4)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 was mainly due to Ni species and the addition of Pt enhanced the activity of Ni species. Figure 8 shows the TPR profiles of Ni(4)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 modified with noble metals. The addition of 0.1 wt% Pt in- creased hydrogen consumption at 520 K and decreased that at 620 K. On the other hand, no peaks were observed on Pt(0.1)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 around 520 K. These indicate that the peak at 520 K on Pt(0.1)/Ni(4)/CeO 2 (30)/Al 2 O 3 can be as- signed to the reduction of NiO promoted by the Pt addition. From the comparison between the TPR profiles of M/Ni/ CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 and M/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 (M = Rh and Ru), the lower temperature peaks below 500 K may be assigned to the reduc- tion of CeO 2 promoted by the presence of Rh and Ru, and these behaviors are different from the case of Pt. These results suggest that Pt tends to interact with NiO species, and other noble metals tend to interact with CeO 2 . This was supported by EXAFS results that Pt-Ni alloy was formed [30], while Rh, Ru, and Pd did not alloy with Ni. Combination of catalytic performance and characterization results suggests that high performance of Pt/Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 can be due to the strong interaction between Pt and Ni to form Pt-Ni alloy.

Dalin LI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 583â€“594 In addition, the coke was formed on Pt/Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 during the reaction as shown in Fig. 7, and this can deactivate the catalyst. The deposited coke was removed by the combus- tion with air, but one problem is the aggregation of Ni metal particles during the reaction and regeneration procedure [31]. Therefore, the re-dispersion of Ni metal particles by the cata- lyst regeneration is thought to be necessary. It has been known that the interaction of Ni and MgO is strong and NiO-MgO solid solution is easily formed. At the same time, the reduction of the NiO-MgO solid solution gives small Ni metal particles [48,62,63]. We expect that the re-dispersion of aggregated Ni metal particles can be attached by the addition of MgO to the catalyst via formation and reduction of NiO-MgO solid solu- tion. 4 Steam reforming of tar over Pt/Ni/CeO2/MgO/Al2O3 [31] Ni/CeO 2 /MgO/Al 2 O 3 (CI) was prepared by the co-impregnation method using an aqueous solution of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 ç„’ 6H 2 O, Ce(NH 4 ) 2 (NO 3 ) 6 , and Mg(NO 3 ) 2 ç„’ 6H 2 O [31] in a similar way for Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 (CI). Pt/Ni/CeO 2 /MgO/ Al 2 O 3 (CI) was prepared by the impregnation of aqueous so- lution of Pt(NO 2 ) 2 (NH 3 ) 2 on Ni/CeO 2 /MgO/Al 2 O 3 (CI) in the same way for Pt/Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 (CI). As a reference, Pt/Ni/MgO/Al 2 O 3 (CI) was prepared in a similar way. The loading amount of each component is described in parentheses as mass percent on all the catalysts. Figure 9 shows the cata- lytic performance of Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 together with those of Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/Al 2 O 3 and Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 . Judging from the tar yield, the order of the catalytic activity is as follows: Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/ CeO 2 (15)/Al 2 O 3 Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 >> Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 . It should be noted that the ad- dition of MgO to Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (2)/Al 2 O 3 suppressed the carbon formation to some extent. Although the details are not shown here, Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 showed lower activity than Ni(12)/MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 . However, it is found that the performance of Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 became comparable to that of Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/Al 2 O 3 in the presence of a small amount of added Pt. Figure 10 displays the formation rate of the gaseous prod- ucts with time on stream over Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/ ratio Fig. 9. Catalytic performance in steam reforming of tar on Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/Al 2 O 3 , Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 , and Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 [31]. Conditions: biomass, 60 mg/min (H 2 O, 9.2%; C, 2191 mol/min; H, 3543 mol/min; O, 1475 mol/min); steam, 1110 mol/min, (added H 2 O)/C = 0.5; reaction time, 15 min; catalyst, 1.0 g; H 2 reduction at 773 K for 30 min.

Loading amount: Ni, 4 wt%; Pt, 0.1 wt%; Rh, 0.1 wt%; Ru, 0.5 wt%. Dalin LI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 583â€“594 MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 without H 2 reduction pretreatment. The forma- tion rate increased with time on stream and it reached the similar value to that over the catalyst with H 2 reduction pre- treatment after 12 min. This result indicates that the tar de- rived from the pyrolysis of cedar wood can reduce the cata- lyst, although the reduction of Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/ MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 was not so rapid as described below. This be- havior indicates that the Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/MgO(2)/ Al 2 O 3 catalyst can be activated automatically by the reactants, which is regarded as the ability of the self-activation property [57,6062]. Figure 11 shows the TPR profiles of the calcined catalysts. The amount of H 2 consumption below 773 K and the Ni-based reduction degree estimated from the amount of H 2 consump- tion are listed in Table 5. On Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/Al 2 O 3 , the reduction proceeds mainly below 773 K. The profile of Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 was greatly different from that of Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/Al 2 O 3 , and this can be explained by the effect of the presence of MgO. On Pt(0.1)/ Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 , the temperature range of the H 2 consumption was much broader. The TPR profile of Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 was also obtained, and the main peak was located at about 1073 K. As shown in Fig. 2, the NiO on -Al 2 O 3 can be reduced below 873 K. Based on these results, it is interpreted that the presence of MgO decreases the reducibility of Ni species and it can be caused by the strong interaction between NiO and MgO obtained by the formation of NiO-MgO solid solution. The molar ratio of MgO to NiO is only 1/4, but the effect of MgO is rather strong. The Ni-based reduction degree on Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/ CeO 2 (15)/Al 2 O 3 below 773 K decreased significantly to about 1/3 by the addition of MgO. This tendency was more remark- able on Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 . In addition, the amount of H 2 adsorption on fresh catalysts is also listed in Table 5. The amount of H 2 adsorption on Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/ Fig. 10. Catalytic performance with time on stream over Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 (CI) without H 2 reduction [31].

Dalin LI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 583â€“594 MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 was almost the same as that on Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/ CeO 2 (15)/Al 2 O 3 , although the reduction degree was much lower. This behavior indicates that the MgO addition pro- motes the dispersion of Ni metal particles, although it de- creases the reduction degree of Ni species. The negative effect can be compensated by the promoting effect. The amount of H 2 adsorption on Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 was much smaller than those on other catalysts, and this can be con- nected to lower catalytic performance in the steam reforming of tar (Fig. 9). Furthermore, the TPR profile of Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/ CeO 2 (15)/MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 is also related to the performance of catalysts without H 2 reduction (Fig. 10). The slower activation process by the tar over Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/MgO(2)/ Al 2 O 3 is explained by the lower reducibility. Figure 12 shows the catalytic performance with time on stream at 923 K over the Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/Al 2 O 3 and Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The forma- tion rate and C-conversion on the Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/ Al 2 O 3 catalyst decreased drastically at about 120 min, and this behavior corresponded to catalyst deactivation [31]. On the other hand, the Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 cata- lyst maintained high activity even after 240 min. This indi- cated that the addition of MgO can improve the catalyst sta- bility. The dispersion of the Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/MgO(2)/ Al 2 O 3 is higher than that of Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/Al 2 O 3 (Table 5) and MgO addition enhanced the Ni dispersion caused by strong interaction between Ni and MgO. Figure 13 shows the XRD patterns of Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/Al 2 O 3 and Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 after reduction, reac- tion, and regeneration. The average particle size of Ni metal on Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/Al 2 O 3 after the reduction was esti- mated to be 18.7 nm. The reaction and the regeneration in- creased the particle size of 25.1 nm and 30.5 nm, respectively. This behavior indicates that the Ni metal particles are aggre- gated gradually in each treatment step. It is characteristic that the peak assigned to Ni metal on Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/ Fig. 12.

Dalin LI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 583â€“594 MgO(2)/Al 2 O 3 after the reduction was much smaller than that on Pt(0.1)/Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/Al 2 O 3 . This suggests that much smaller Ni metal particles are majorly present on the catalyst surface. The peak grew after the reaction, and the Ni metal particles aggregated to some extent. But the regeneration re- produced the very small, broad XRD peak, suggesting the re-dispersion of the aggregated particles. 5 Steam reforming of tar over Ni/MnO/Al2O3 [32] From the above results, it is concluded that the interaction of Ni and CeO 2 promoted the steam reforming of tar, especially by the activation of tar on Ni metal surface and the supply of oxygen atoms from the redox property of CeO 2 . Here, we attempted the replacement of CeO 2 with other redox species such as Mn oxides. Ni/MnO x /Al 2 O 3 (CI) was prepared by the co-impregnation method using the mixed aqueous solution of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 Â·6H 2 O and Mn(NO 3 ) 2 Â·6H 2 O in a similar way to that of Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 (CI) [32]. The loading amounts of Ni and MnO are described in parentheses as mass percent on the catalyst. Figure 14 compares the catalytic performance in steam re- forming of tar over Ni(12)/MnO(20)/Al 2 O 3 and Ni(12)/ CeO 2 (15)/Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The activity of Ni(12)/MnO(20)/ Al 2 O 3 was so high that the tar was almost completely converted at all reaction temperatures. On the other hand, the activity of Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/Al 2 O 3 was not so high as that of Ni(12)/MnO/ (20)/Al 2 O 3 , and the residual tar was detected at 823 K, although almost no tar was observed above 873 K. In addition, at each reaction temperature, the order of the resistance to coke for- mation was Ni(12)/MnO(20)/Al 2 O 3 > Ni(12)/CeO 2 (15)/Al 2 O 3 . These results indicate that the additive effect of MnO was more significant than that of CeO 2 . The promoting effect of MnO x addition can be explained in a similar way as that of CeO 2 addition, that is, the oxygen atoms derived from MnO x species can be supplied to the Ni species to promote the reaction be- tween carbonaceous species on Ni and oxygen species [32]. 6 Conclusions The Ni catalyst supported on CeO 2 was effective to the suppression of coke deposition in the steam reforming of tar, and this property can be related to the Ni on CeO 2 with high reducibility. The addition of CeO 2 to Ni/Al 2 O 3 by the co-impregnation method led to strong interaction between Ni metal and CeO 2 by the formation of Ni-CeO 2 nanocomposite structure. This Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst showed high activity and resistance to coke deposition in the steam reforming of tar. The addition of a small amount of Pt to Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 pro- moted the catalyst reducibility, and the catalyst was reduced with tar and steam easily. Further addition of MgO to Pt/Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 enabled the re-dispersion of the aggregated Ni particles via NiO-MgO solid solution formation and its reduction. High performance of Ni-CeO 2 by the redox property of CeO 2 suggests the potential of other oxides such as man- ganese oxides. It is found that manganese oxides are also an effective additive on the Ni catalysts for the steam reforming of tar. In the development of the catalysts for the steam reforming of tar, the optimization of the additives and their composition is important, and this can give various functions including high activity, stability, self-activation, and self-regeneration proper- ties to catalysts.

REVIEW Development of Ni-Based Catalysts for Steam Reforming of Tar Derived from Biomass Pyrolysis Dalin LI a b Yoshinao NAKAGAWA a Keiichi TOMISHIGE a * a Department of Applied Chemistry, School of Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8579, Japan b National Engineering Research Center of Chemical Fertilizer Catalyst, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, China * Corresponding author. Tel: +81-22-795-7214; Fax: +81-22-795-7214 Nickel catalysts are effective for the steam reforming of tar derived from biomass pyrolysis, but the improvement is needed in terms of activity, stability, suppression of coke deposition and aggregation, and regeneration. Our recent development of Ni-based catalysts for the steam reforming of tar is reviewed including the modification with CeO2 (or MnO), trace Pt, and MgO. The role of additives such as CeO2, MnO, Pt, and MgO is also discussed. Graphical abstract The development of multi-functional Ni catalysts for steam reforming of biomass tar was presented, and it may provide useful information toward the design of novel catalysts for the conversion of biomass to synthesis gas.
