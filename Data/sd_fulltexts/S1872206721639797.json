Integrating two different catalytic active sites into one composite is a useful 2-in-1 strategy for designing high-efficient bifunctional catalysts, which can easily tailor the activity of each reaction. Hence, we adopt the 2-in-1 strategy to design the metal oxyhydroxide supported on N-doped porous carbons (PA-CoFe@NPC) as the oxygen bifunctional catalyst, where NPC provides the activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) while the metal oxyhydroxide is responsible for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Results demonstrate that the PA-CoFe@NPC indeed exhibits both super ORR and OER activities. Impressively, using bifunctional PA-CoFe@NPC as the oxygen electrode, the resulting Zn-air battery exhibits outstanding charge and discharge performance with the peak power density of 156.3 mW cm–2, and also exhibits a long-term cycle stability with continuous cyclic charge and discharge of 170 hours that is obviously better than the 20% Pt/C+IrO2 based one. The 2-in-1 strategy in this work can be efficiently extended to design other bi- or multi-functional electrocatalysts. Graphical Abstract The simple 2-in-1 strategy to design the metal oxyhydroxide supported on N-doped porous carbons as ORR and OER bifunctional electrocatalysts for rechargeable Zn-air battery. Keywords Two-in-one strategy Bifunctional catalyst Oxygen reduction Oxygen evolution Zn-air battery 1 Introduction These devices related to new energy storage and conversion, e.g. fuel cells [1–3], water splittings [4–6] and metal-air batteries [7–9], are performing a vital role in the clean energy field. Especially, the rechargeable Zn-air batteries have been widely concerned owing to high theoretical energy density [10], environmental friendliness and relative safety [11,12]. However, the property of Zn-air batteries is limited by the sluggish dynamics of (oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction) ORR/OER occurring at the oxygen electrode [13]. At present, precious metal Pt/C, IrO2 and RuO2, are believed to be the benchmark electrocatalysts for ORR/OER. However, their high cost and rareness hinder the commercial applications [14,15]. Thus, developing non-precious metal ORR/OER catalysts is highly desirable. ORR and OER are a pair of reversible reactions and their active sites are different apparently. Currently, the carbon materials related catalysts, such as heteroatom doping [16], single atom M-N-C [17–22], nanoparticles loading [23], with high specific surface area (SSA) and rich pore structure have been reported extensively for ORR, and their alkaline ORR performance can even exceed commercial Pt/C [24,25]. In particular, nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) is one of the most effective metal-free catalysts, because the nitrogen with high electronegativity is able to optimize the electronic structure of catalysts and surface charge redistribution, which would tune O2 chemisorption and further promote ORR [26]. However, the metal-free NPCs cannot effectively catalyze the OER due to the lack of OER active sites, which means that the NPCs are not a good bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst [27–29]. Previous investigations indicate that the metal oxides or oxyhydroxides (MOOH) were regarded to be the real OER active center [30,31], but they almost have no ORR activity. Therefore, the 2-in-1 strategy of integrating highly ORR and OER active site (such as MOOH and NPCs) into one composite is significant to design efficient oxygen bifunctional catalysts, which has autologous advantages of definite active sites, structure flexibility and performance adjustability. The metal hydroxide or MOOH were prepared generally by solvothermal or electrochemical deposition methods, which is completely different from the synthesis of porous carbon by high temperature carbonization. Therefore, it is significant to adopt a simple method to assemble MOOH and NPCs into one integrated electrode. The physically adsorbed metal ion (PAMI) method reported previously [32] may be an excellent candidate to achieve the synthesis of 2-in-1 composite by the in-situ transfer of metal ion adsorbed on NPCs under high OER potential. In this work, we used the PAMI method to successfully prepare the 2-in-1 composite (PA-CoFe/NPC) for ORR and OER. The PA-CoFe/NPC shows not only prominent ORR performance (half-wave potential of 0.85 V, vs. RHE), but also super OER activity (about 384 mV overpotential to yield 10 mA cm–2). Impressively, by using the bifunctional PA-CoFe@NPC as the oxygen electrode, the resultant Zn-air battery exhibits exceptional charging and discharging curves with maximum power density of 156.3 mW cm–2 and long-term charge and discharge cycle performance with the stable operation of 170 h. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Reagent Adenine, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, ferric chloride and cobalt chloride hexahydrate were bought from MACKLIN and HCl was purchased from Beijing Chemical Works. All chemicals in the synthesis are analytical reagents without further treatment. 2.2 Materials synthesis Preparation of N-doped porous carbon (NPC). The N-doped porous carbon was fabricated by using the MgCl2·6H2O as the template that is a modification of the previous literature (Mater. Horiz., 2017, 4, 493-501). In detail, 0.5 g adenine and 5 g MgCl2·6H2O were grinded according to the mass ratio of 1:10 in the glove box. The mixture was transferred into a corundum porcelain boat in tube furnace and carbonized at 900 °C for 1 hour with the ramp rate of 2.5 °C min–1 in the argon atmosphere. Then, the carbonized sample was washed in deionized water by ultrasonicated for 1 h, and washed twice in 2 mol L–1 HCl by stirring. After the suction filtration and washed it to pH = 7, the sample was dried for overnight. The dried sample was carbonized at 1000 °C for 2 h with the ramp rate of 5 °C min–1 in the argon atmosphere, named NPC. Preparation of PA-CoFe@NPC. 27.2 mg FeCl3 and 159.6 mg CoCl2·6H2O was dissolved in 10 mL deionized water to prepare FeCo metal ions solution. Then, 30 mg of NPC was added to the metal ions solution, which was stirred at room temperature for 6 h, centrifuged, and dried overnight. After the physical adsorption FeCo metal ions process and OER electrochemical activation, the final sample was obtained, named PA-CoFe@NPC. As for the PA-Co@NPC and PA-Fe@NPC, the preparation was similar to the above process, the NPC was added to the Co metal ions solution (199.5 mg CoCl2·6H2O in 10 mL deionized water) named PA-Co@NPC, and the NPC was added to the Fe metal ions solution (136.1 mg FeCl3 in 10 mL deionized water) named PA-Fe@NPC. 2.3 Materials characterization Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were tested on Hitachi S-4800. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) was gained from JEM 2100F. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was obtained from Thermo Scientific K-Alpha+ with A1 Kα as X-ray source. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was analyzed by D/MAX 2000 X-ray with Cu Kα line. The specific surface (BET) and pore size distribution (PSD) were conducted on ASAP 2460. 2.4 H2O2 and the electron transfer number The yield of H2O2 and the electron transfer number (n) was analyzed by rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) with the basis of following equations: n = 4 × I d ( I r / N ) + I d H 2 O 2 ( % ) = 200 × I r / N ( I r / N ) + I d in which I d is the disk current, I r is the ring current and N is the current collection efficiency of RRDE (0.37). The electron transfer number (n) can also be analyzed by RDE with the basis of following equations (the Koutecky-Levich plots): 1 J = 1 J L + 1 J k = 1 B ω 1 / 2 + 1 J k B = 0.62 n F C 0 D 2 / 3 γ - 1 / 6 in which J is the measured current density, J k is the kinetic current density, J L is the limiting current density, ω is the angular velocity, n is electron transfer number, F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol–1), C 0 is the concentration of O2 (1.2 × 10–3 mol L–1), D is the diffusion coefficient of O2 in 0.1 mol L–1 KOH (1.9 × 10–5 cm2 s–1), and γ is the kinematic viscosity (0.01 cm2 s–1). 2.5 Assembly of rechargeable Zn-air batteries The rechargeable Zn-air battery was assembled in 6 mol L–1 KOH with 0.2 mol L–1 ZnO solution, in which zinc plate was used as anode, catalyst (PA-CoFe@NPC) loaded on carbon paper (with loading capacity is 1 mg cm–2 and area is 1 cm–2) was applied as cathode. As comparison, 1 mg 20% Pt/C and 1mg IrO2 were also loaded on 1 cm2 carbon paper as the cathode of Zn-air battery. 3 Result and discussion Fig. 1(a) depicts the synthesis diagram of PA-CoFe@NPC. First, the NPC with large SSA was prepared by pyrolysis of adenine and hard template MgCl2·6H2O, and it can be severed as the support and ORR reaction site. Then, the NPC was immersed in the aqueous solution of CoFe metal salt and stirred at room temperature (labeled as P-PA-CoFe@NPC). The metal salts adsorbed on NPC would be in situ transferred into CoFe-OOH active sites under OER potential. As a result, the sample (marked as PA-CoFe@NPC) rich in two active sites (MOOH and N doped carbon) can be obtained for bifunctional oxygen electrode. For comparison, these samples with pure metal adsorption (Co or Fe) were also prepared (marked as PA-Co@NPC and PA-Fe@NPC, respectively). Figs. 1(b), S1 and 1(c) show the SEM and TEM images of metal ion-adsorbed NPC (P-PA-CoFe@NPC), which exhibits a uniform interconnected porous network, basically maintaining the morphology of NPC. The SSA of P-PA-CoFe@NPC is about 1314 m2 g–1 (Fig. S2(a)) and it possesses affluent micropores, mesopores and macropores (Fig. S2(b)). The hierarchical pore characteristic of P-PA-CoFe@NPC is beneficial not only for exposing plentiful active sites, but also for gas transport. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) patterns (Figs. 1(d)–(h)) show the evenly distributed Fe, Co, C and N elements, which is also verified by full XPS spectrum of P-PA-CoFe@NPC (Fig. S3). The N 1s XPS spectra of P-PA-CoFe@NPC in Fig. S4 were separated into three peaks, attributed to pyridinic N (398.5 eV), graphitic N (401.2 eV), and oxidized-N (404.0 eV), respectively. The high content of pyridinic N and graphitic N is beneficial to efficiently accelerate ORR reaction [33,34]. The ORR activities of as-synthesized samples (including PA-CoFe@NPC, PA-Co@NPC, PA-Fe@NPC and NPC) were tested in O2-saturated 0.1 mol L–1 KOH electrolyte. PA-CoFe@NPC presents a onset potential of 0.95 V, vs. RHE and half-wave potential of 0.85 V, vs. RHE, respectively, which are basically similar with 20% Pt/C, PA-Co@NPC and PA-Fe@NPC (Fig. 2(a) ), while it is slightly inferior to NPC. The observation indicates that NPC provides the real ORR catalytic sites of pyridinic N and graphitic N, and the metal ions adsorbed on NPC do not contribution for ORR. Moreover, these samples of PA-CoFe@NPC, PA-Co@NPC, PA-Fe@NPC and NPC also exhibit similar smaller Tafel slope (~74 mV dec–1) compared to 20% Pt/C (81 mV dec–1), meaning better ORR kinetics (Fig. 2(b)). The RRDE was further measured to obtain the electron transfer number (n) and the H2O2 yield of PA-CoFe@NPC. As described in Fig. 2(c), the n is between 3.89 and 3.98 and the H2O2 yield of PA-CoFe@NPC is < 5.7% in the scope of 0.2 to 0.8 V that indicates 4-electron pathway to produce the H2O on PA-CoFe@NPC. We also calculated the n by the Koutechy-Levich equation by testing linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves under different rotation rates to authenticate above result (Figs. S5 and S6). As expected, the n is 3.95 at 0.6 V that is consistent with the result from RRDE. It confirms that PA-CoFe@NPC possesses high 4-electron selectivity. The durability and methanol resistance are also pivotal factors for large-scale application of the electrocatalysts. The stability of PA-CoFe@NPC and 20% Pt/C was evaluated via chronoamperometry at constant potential of 0.6 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 mol L–1 KOH solution. After 40000 s of continuous ORR process at rotation rate of 1600 r min–1, PA-CoFe@NPC exhibits the current retention rate of 95.7%, which is obviously better than the retention rate (81.2%) of commercial 20% Pt/C in the same case (Fig. 2(d)). In addition, the PA-CoFe@NPC also has excellent methanol resistance with a stable operation after 3 mL of methanol was put into the electrolyte (Fig. S7). Instead, a sudden decline of current happens for 20% Pt/C after adding the methanol. The experimental results illustrate that the PA-CoFe@NPC has superior stability and methanol immunity to 20% Pt/C, which makes the PA-CoFe@NPC promising in practical application. Fig. 3(a) describes the LSV of OER with iR-correction of the synthesized catalysts in 0.1 mol L–1 KOH electrolyte. Obviously, the NPC has a quite inferior OER performance to other samples. After the metal ions were adsorbed physically and in situ OER transformation, impressively, the PA-CoFe@NPC presents a spectacular performance improvement and it needs about 384 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm–2, which is apparently better than these contrast samples of IrO2 (458 mV), single metal PA-Co@NPC (431 mV) and PA-Fe@NPC (480 mV). The observation indicates that CoFe bimetallic adsorption yields efficient OER active sites. In addition, the Tafel slope of PA-CoFe@NPC is 80 mV dec–1 that is lower than PA-Co@NPC (91 mV dec–1), PA-Fe@NPC (99 mV dec–1), illustrating the outstanding OER kinetics of PA-CoFe@NPC (Fig. 3(b)). The Nyquist plots were fitted to a simplified Randles equivalent circuit model, which includes an electrolyte resistance (R s), two pairs of reaction resistances (R ct) and constant-phase element (CPE) (Fig. 3(c)). The small semicircles in the high frequency range correspond to the internal charge-transfer resistances of R ct1 for the electrode and the main semicircles in the low frequency zone is attributed to the charge-transfer resistance of R ct2 at the solid and liquid interface between electrode and electrolyte. As expected, the PA-CoFe@NPC presents an apparent smaller R ct1 of 5.9 Ω and R ct2 of 24.1 Ω compared with PA-Co@NPC, PA-Fe@NPC and NPC (the specific values were listed in Table S1), indicating that PA-CoFe@NPC has the fastest charge and ion transfer among all synthesized samples. The OER durability of PA-CoFe@NPC was performed by chronopotentiometric measurement, in which the catalyst was supported on the carbon paper (Fig. S8). PA-CoFe@NPC remains a good stability in 20-h OER process. Generally, the potential difference ΔE (E (j=10, OER)–E (1/2, ORR)) between OER (10 mA cm–2) and ORR (half-wave potential) is a significant index for the evaluation of bifunctional catalysts activity. As shown in Fig. 3(d), the ΔE of PA-CoFe@NPC is 0.76 V, obviously less than that of 20% Pt/C+IrO2 (ΔE of 0.85 V), PA-Co@NPC (ΔE of 0.82 V) and PA-Fe@NPC (ΔE of 0.86 V). The observation further confirms that PA-CoFe@NPC is an excellent bifunctional oxygen catalyst accommodating adequate ORR and OER catalytic sites. The electrochemical reactions towards ORR and OER are three phase interfacial reactions, in which the structural and surface properties can directly affect the electrochemical activity. The electrochemical test results indicate that the adsorbed metal ions in PA-CoFe@NPC offer significant contribution to OER. So, a series of characterizations of samples at 50 cycles of cyclic voltammetry scanning at the scope of 1.0–1.6 V vs. RHE, were implemented to explore the composition and morphology of the PA-CoFe@NPC catalysts after OER activation process. The TEM images of Fig. 4(a) and Fig. S9 exhibit that the NPC substrate remains the original structure. Impressively, as shown in Figs. 4(b) and 4(c), the metal nanoparticles are observed by high resolution TEM (HRTEM) and dark field scanning (several small bright clusters in the carbon substrate), in which the lattice fringe spacing is ascribed to the (200) plane of CoOOH (PDF#26-0480), illustrating the metal oxyhydroxides are in situ generated under the OER process and it is the true active centers for OER. This observation is in excellent agreement with previous literatures [32,35]. The EDS mapping displays that Co, Fe, C, N and O elements are uniformly dispersed on the whole catalyst (Figs. 4(c)–(i)). No obvious diffraction peak was discovered in X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum because the nanoparticles size is too small (Fig. S10). The XPS was performed to probe the valence state and element composition of metal in PA-CoFe@NPC catalyst. In Fig. 4(j), the high-resolution Co 2p spectra mainly appear at 781.5 and 797.3 eV for P-PA-CoFe@NPC, attributed to +2 valence Co in the precursor metal salt. After OER activation, the peak of Co 2p has a negative shift to 780.3 eV that is an oxidation process from Co(II) to Co(III), which also proves the formation of metal oxyhydroxide during OER reaction. On the contrary, the spectra of Fe 2p did not change significantly and still keep +3 oxidation state (located at 711.8 eV for Fe 2p 3/2) after OER (Fig. 4(k)). Combined with XPS, TEM and electrochemical test results, it is determined that the in-situ grown CoFe oxyhydroxide significantly promotes OER performance compared with N doped carbon sample, which also proves that the metal oxyhydroxide is the real OER active site. Meanwhile, the NPC porous carbon with large specific surface area and high conductivity not only provides abundant accessible ORR active sites and improved electron transport, but also can act as host to adsorb more metal ions for in-situ generation of more OER active sites. The features render the outstanding bifunctional property of PA-CoFe@NPC catalysts, which verifies that the 2-in-1 strategy exhibits highly efficient designability for oxygen bifunctional catalysts. Owing to the excellent ORR/OER activities, the bifunctional PA-CoFe@NPC catalyst was further used as oxygen electrode to assemble the primary and rechargeable alkaline Zn-air batteries (Fig. 5(a) ). For comparison, the commercial 20% Pt/C+IrO2 based one was also investigated. The open-circuit voltage of the PA-CoFe@NPC based battery is 1.45 V (Fig. 5(b)), and its discharging polarization curves exhibit better performance than commercial 20% Pt/C counterpart and its peak power density reaches 156.3 mW cm–2 at 285.1 mA cm–2 (Fig. 5(c)), exceeding the 20% Pt/C+IrO2 battery (145.6 mW cm–2). In addition, the charging curve of PA-CoFe@NPC based Zn-air battery also shows comparable performance to the 20% Pt/C+IrO2 counterpart (Fig. 5(d)), demonstrating that the PA-CoFe@NPC catalyst designed by the 2-in-1 strategy can achieve bifunctional application in Zn-air battery. The cyclic charging-discharging stability was tested under 5 mA cm–2 to monitor the durability of PA-CoFe@NPC (Figs. 5(e), S11, S12). As for the PA-CoFe@NPC-based battery, the initial charge and discharge potential of the battery are 1.96 and 1.18 V respectively, and the potential gap is only 0.78 V. After the stable operation of 170 h, the PA-CoFe@NPC based battery has a minor attenuation and the potential gap becomes to 0.87 V, obviously better than 20% Pt/C+IrO2 based one (the potential gap increases to 1.02 V after 20 h). These results prove the feasibility of the prepared electrocatalysts in practical Zn-air battery. Moreover, the morphology of PA-CoFe@NPC catalyst remains almost unchanged after the stability test in Zn-air batteries, confirming its high activity and stability (Figs. S13 and S14). 4 Conclusions In summary, we adopted the 2-in-1 strategy to successfully synthesize the metal oxyhydroxide supported on N-doped porous carbons (PA-CoFe@NPC) as the efficient ORR and OER electrocatalyst, in which NPC brings about excellent ORR performance in term with the half-wave potential of 0.85 V, while the OER occurs on in situ generated CoFe-OOH species with an overpotential of 384 mV to reach 10 mA cm–2. The ΔE for PA-CoFe@NPC is 0.76 V, superior to that of 20% Pt/C+IrO2 (0.85 V). Notably, the PA-CoFe@NPC based Zn-air battery exhibits both outstanding charge and discharge performance and peak power density of 156.3 mW cm–2. Meanwhile, a 170-hour of continuous cyclic charge and discharge with high retention was also realized. This work offers a fresh 2-in-1 strategy for designing bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts, and it can be efficiently extended to design other bi- or multi-functional electrocatalysts.

Hence, we adopt the 2-in-1 strategy to design the metal oxyhydroxide supported on N-doped porous carbons (PA-CoFe@NPC) as the oxygen bifunctional catalyst, where NPC provides the activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) while the metal oxyhydroxide is responsible for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Results demonstrate that the PA-CoFe@NPC indeed exhibits both super ORR and OER activities. Impressively, using bifunctional PA-CoFe@NPC as the oxygen electrode, the resulting Zn-air battery exhibits outstanding charge and discharge performance with the peak power density of 156.3 mW cm–2, and also exhibits a long-term cycle stability with continuous cyclic charge and discharge of 170 hours that is obviously better than the 20% Pt/C+IrO2 based one. The 2-in-1 strategy in this work can be efficiently extended to design other bi- or multi-functional electrocatalysts.",
