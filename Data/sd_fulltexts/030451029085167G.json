Koranyi, Valerii Rozanov*, Rita Kremo and Zoltan Paal Institute of Isotopes of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H-1525 Budapest, P.O. Box 77 (Hungary) (Received December 12, 1989; revised May 25, 1990) Abstract Thiophene hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activities and product distributions of impregnated Co/C, CoMo/C and Mo/C catalysts were studied at 673 K and atmospheric pressure. Two kinds of pretreatments (prereduction by hydrogen or presulfldation by Hz/HgS mixture) were carried out on Co and/or Mo catalysts supported on three kinds of carbon (non- activated, activated by COg for 1 h and 10 h). These catalysts were tested in thiophene HDS. Characteristic synergistic effects were not observed, either in thiophene conversions (CONV) or in hydrogenation selectivities (HYD) of butene products of the HDS reaction. The latter values were similar for Co/C and Mo/C catalysts, in contrast to alumina- supported samples. CONV and HYD values of Co/C catalysts were more stable with increasing reaction time than those of Mo-containing samples, and these values decreased in most cases in the following order: presulflded 'non-pretreated' prereduced catalysts. The above order and the gradual decrease in CONV and HYD values with increasing Co content of prereduced samples show that reduction of cobalt is not favourable to high CONV and HYD values, because this reduced Co cannot be sulflded by the hydrogen/ thiophene reaction mixture and oxidic Co (in non-pretreated samples) cannot be sulfided efficiently in the HDS reaction. High 1-butene and trans-2-butene excesses over ther- modynamic equilibrium ratios of butene isomers were found on non-activated and 1 h- activated carbon-supported catalysts, which indicate the predominance of the reaction route producing 1-butene over these supports. Higher specific surface areas of the activated support seem likely to result in higher surface areas of active phase, too, but it presumably cannot prevent the segregation of metallic Co during prereduction. Widening of micropores and the increasing number of mesopores during activation of the support also contribute to the increasing HDS activities and HYD selectivities. Introduction Carbon-supported Co Mo catalysts have recently aroused remarkable interest in the literature of hydrodesulfurization (HDS). Duchet et al. [1] first revealed unproved catalytic activity for HDS on carbon- instead of alumina-supported samples. Later Prins and coworkers [1-6] thoroughly examined the carbon-supported HDS catalysts. Vissers et al. [2] found that the initial deactivation during thiophene HDS reaction on Mo/C and Mo/AlaOs catalysts cannot be caused by sintering of the active phase or by pore blocking. Later Vissers et al. [3, 4] revealed significant dispersion decrease On leave from N: N. Semenov Institute of Chemical Physics, Moscow, U.S.S.R. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 32 during sulfidation by HaS of oxidic precursors of CoMo/C and Mo/C catalysts, but higher HDS activity was shown than on alumina-supported samples. The higher activity of carbon-supported samples was explained by their more complete sulfidation and their different active phase-support interaction as compared to alumina-supported catalysts [3 6]. A theory was proposed, based on the above results: accordingly, the cobalt atoms were the actual active sites in Co-Mo sulfide catalysts for thiophene HDS [3, 6]. The role of MoSg in this model was to serve as a support for optimally dispersed cobalt ions [3, 6-8] and to enhance the hydrogenation activity of the catalysts [7]. This theory was supported by the results of van der Kraan et al. [8], who identified the Mossbauer signal of the so-called 'CoMoS' phase which is widely accepted as most active phase in HDS catalysts [9, 10] in Co/ C samples. The presence of molybdenum thus would not be required in the most active surface species. All above-mentioned results were obtained in massively presulfided catalysts. We investigated the activation, i.e. the transition of oxidic precursors to sulfided species, of unsupported and alumina-supported catalysts in our previous studies [11-18]. We identified short-lived cobaltr-oxythiomolybdates in unsupported samples by X-ray diffraction [14] and infrared spectroscopy [16] and we proposed these phases as possible active species both in unsupported [14] and in alumina-supported [18] catalysts. Two kinds of pretreatments, namely prereduction and presulfidation, were applied in this work and thiophene HDS reaction was carried out over non-pretreated and pretreated catalysts. The aim of the present study is to cany out similar investigations also on carbon-supported catalysts. Activated carbon originating from olive stones was characterized ex- tensively [19-21] and has been used successfully as supports for platinum. The dispersion found [19] was dependent on the number of pores with diameter between 9 and 11 nm. The Pt particles underwent sintering during reduction in Hg similar to unsupported Pt black [22, 23]. We used similar activated carbon supports in this work. Experimental Supports Three kinds of carbon supports prepared from olive stones were used [19, 20]. The first (HA-1) was prepared by carbonization of olive stones at 1273 K in 300 ml per min N3 flow. The heating rate was 5 K min\"1, and the residence time was 1 h. The other two supports were activated at 1273 K by 300 ml per min COg flow (heating rate 5 K min\"1) for 1 h (HA-3) or 10 h (HA-6), respectively. The properties of the supports are shown in Table 1. Catalysts The carbon supports were impregnated by aqueous solutions of (NH4)gMo7024 4HaO and/or Co(NC>3)2 6HzO (Reanal puriss each) in nominal 33 TABLE 1 Ash contents, specific surface areas measured by NzC'S'CNg)) or CoaCSCCOz)) adsorption, and pore volumes (V.r)1' of various carbon supports Support property HA-1 HA-3 HA-6 Ash (wt.%) 0.1 0.1 0.1 S(Na) (m2 g-1) 333 424 1171 5(COz) (m2 g-1) 871 960 1205 Vr (cm3 g-1) 0.435 0.519 1.037 V, (cm3 g-') 0.292 0.304 0.602 V^ (cm3 g-1) 0.021 0.056 0.150 3 (cm3 g-1) 0.122 0.159 0.285 ''a;=T=total pore volume, x =1= pore volume of lower than 7.5 nm particles, x =2= pore volume of particles between 7.5 nm and 20 nm, a: =3= pore volume of higher than 20 nm particles.

The impregnation by the incipient wetness method was followed by drying at 390 K overnight, the nominal total loadings were 10 mass% calculated to MoOs and/or CoO active phases. The real molar r ratios and active phase contents were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) (Table 2). 20 mg dried impregnated (vmp) samples were placed in the reactor of a continuous flow system [15]. Two types of pretreatments were applied on imp samples, both were carried out at 673 K in a flow of gas mixtures (40 ml/min). Either prereduction (red) was applied for 2 h by hydrogen, or presulfidation (svl) for 1 h with 8.67 vol.% HaS-containing hydrogen/hydrogen sulfide gas mixture (Messer Gries- heim) after heating the samples in a N3 stream. Catalytic reaction Thiophene HDS reaction was carried out either on imp or on pretreated catalysts for 70 min with a 35:1 mixture of hydrogen and thiophene at 673 34 K and atmospheric pressure. The composition of the product mixture was determined by GC [15]. Thiophene conversions, hydrogenation selectivities (HYD=(isobutane+n-butane)/2C4), and butene ratios (l-butene/2-butenes and tr(ms-2-butene/cis-2-butene, respectively) of the product mixture were used to characterize the catalytic properties of the catalysts. Results and discussion Surface characteristics of the supports are shown in Table 1. The low ash contents are advantageous features, because they may mean a low resistance to metal particle sintering in the resulting catalyst [19]. The adsorption of N3 (77 K) and COg (273 K) complement each other and can provide more complete information about the microporous structure of activated carbons [21]. The much larger surface areas of HA-1 and HA-3 supports measured by COg than those determined by N3 adsorption mean that the micropores of these supports are very narrow at 77 K, therefore the entrance of the nitrogen molecule into the micropores is a restricted process [19]. Upon further activation (HA-6) the micropores are widened and become equally accessible to both adsorbates [19]. All carbons are essentially microporous because of the highest pore volumes of lower than 7.5 nm particles (Table 1), but the micropores of HA-1 and HA-3 supports are much narrower than those of the HA-6 support. The molar Co/(Co + Mo) ratios and active phase contents of impregnated catalysts measured by AAS (Table 2) do not indicate any differences among catalysts prepared with various supports. This can mean that various molybdate anions cannot penetrate into the micropores, and instead are adsorbed in meso- and/or macropores of the support. At the same time, the active phase on the support can be assumed to be present as a thin overlayer in our catalysts, because we were not able to identify any phases on carbon particles by electron microscopy analysis. Thiophene conversion (CONV) and hydrogenation selectivity (HYD) curves of HA-1 carbon-supported catalysts with increasing times-on-stream are shown in Fig. 1. The CONV values of imp Mo/C and CoMo/C samples exhibit maxima and increase, respectively, as a function of the increasing reaction time. The same was also characteristic of unsupported catalysts [11, 15]. This type of curve indicates that these samples are not ready for the HDS reaction because of their ineffective reduction and/or sulfidation degrees [11, 14, 15]. Svl Mo/C catalysts are less active than red ones, which is also characteristic of the initial transition state of unsupported samples [12]. Overall conversions at 10 min reaction time and HYD selectivities over the whole range exhibit mild synergism over sul catalysts, in contrast to the strong synergism of presulfided catalysts found in the literature [3]. HDS synergy was proposed as a temporary phenomenon in unsupported systems and also partly in alumina-supported catalysts [17]. The lack of synergism of imp and red samples and the mild initial synergism of sul catalysts again show a similarity 35 Fig. 1. Thiophene conversions C^(%)) and hydrogenation selectivities (HYD(%) = (isobutane + n- butane)/2C4) as a function of reaction time (((min)) measured over HA-1 carbon-supported Mo (r=0), CoMo (r=0.46), and Co (r=l) catalysts after various pretreatments (.0=imp, + =red, X =sul). to unsupported systems [17]. The CONV values ofCo/C samples are relatively stable and comparable to those of molybdenum-containing catalysts. This is in accordance with the literature [3], but contradicts our observation over unsupported and alumina-supported systems [17, 24]. The stable conversions over Co/C catalysts show the existence of some kind of cobalt-support interaction. The HYD values of imp and red samples with r= 1 are zero. We suppose that cobalt resists sulfidation by the reaction mixture, because unsupported metallic or oxidic Co can be sulfided with hydrogen/thiophene only in the presence of molybdenum [25]. CONV and HYD values of HA-3 carbon supported catalysts (Fig. 2) are similar to the curves of HA-1 supported systems (Fig. 1) concerning the highly similar CONV curves of imp r=l and all red samples, the lack of synergism and the stability in the course of these values of Co/C catalysts. These similarities can be connected with the similar surface characteristics (Table 1) of HA-1 and HA-3 supports. Conversion over imp CoMo/C catalyst decreases strongly with time-on-stream, resembling effectively prereduced unsupported samples [11, 15, 17]. But in the case of unsupported catalysts, prereduction led to a high specific surface area increase [12, 14]. In our case the relatively low surface area increase of support HA-3 as compared to support HA-1 (Table 1) is concomitant with the high surface area increase 36 10305070 103050 70 10 30 50 70 Fig. 2.

Symbols as in Fig. 1. of the active phase, according to the character of CONV curves. On the basis of similar low level CONV curves of HA-1 and HA-3 supported red catalysts, sintering during prereduction is possible. Our hypothesis is, that this sintering can be mainly attributed to the decrease in cobalt dispersion, as shown by the decreasing CONV and HYD values over prereduced catalysts with increasing cobalt content on both kinds of supports (Figs. 1 and 2). Presulfidation presumably does not decrease dispersion or the sulfidation of cobalt overcompensates it, because the CONV and HYD values of sul Mo/ C and Co/C HA-3 supported samples (Fig. 2) are higher than those of HA- 1 supported catalysts (Fig. 1). The relatively high HYD selectivities of imp samples (Fig. 2) are in agreement with the proposed high increase in active phase surface areas of HA-3 activated carbon-supported catalysts, as compared to HA-1 supported samples. The main effect of activation of the support by COa should be a high specific surface area of the active phase in subsequent impregnation. A marked increase in all CONV and HYD values of HA-6 carbon-supported catalysts can be seen in Fig. 3 as compared to those of HA-1 and HA-3 carbon-supported samples. This cannot be only the consequence of increased specific surface areas and pore volumes (Table 1), because not only have the values increased, but the shape of the curves has also changed: both CONV and HYD increase in the following order: red<imp<sul. There are practically no differences between the conversion values over Mo/C catalysts after various pretreatments. The HYD values of szd r=0 sample are highest 37 10 30 50 70 10 30 50 70 10 30 50 70 /min/ Fig. 3.

Symbols as in Pig. 1. compared to those of imp and red r=0 catalysts. We explain these ob- servations with the easier sulfidability of molybdenum because of the higher dispersion of the active phase over the support of higher specific surface and pore volume. We propose that sulfidation of Mo precedes that of Co and that the former is more difficult than the latter, which was originally suggested for unsupported [13] and alumina-supported [18] systems. It can be assumed on the basis of the literature [25-27], that reduction of cobalt and molybdenum oxides at 673 K leads to metallic Co and the partial reduction of MoOa to MoC>2 or other Mo\"'1' species [28]. MoOg cannot be sulfided in any other further treatments at the same temperature. The lower stability of partially sulfided molybdenum and its hindering effect on the sulfidation of cobalt leads to the more rapid deactivation of (Co)Mo catalysts than that of Co/C samples. The increasing HYD values of sill r=0 samples compared to those of imp and red r=0 catalysts with increasing carbon support surface areas originate from the absence of a difficultly sulfidable MoOg phase during sulfidation. The above-mentioned sequence of the curves of variously pretreated samples and the similar CONV levels of all svl HA-6 carbon-supported catalysts can be explained by the most complete sulfidation of both metals by HaS, and by the incomplete sulfidation of the reaction mixture. The increased specific surface areas of the active phase due to the longer activation of the support by COg can influence to CONV and HYD values more effectively because of their higher pore volumes than those of HA-1 and HA-3 supports 38 (Table 1). The pore volume increase of support H 6 is the highest in the mesopore region as compared to those of other supports, therefore the number of pores of this region similarly to platinum-on-carbon catalysts [19] seems to be the most important factor in obtaining high HDS activities and HYD selectivities. Conclusions can be drawn with respect to the reaction mechanism of thiophene HDS from the ratios of butene isomers in the product mixture. The l-butene/2-butenes (Fig. 4) and (r(ms-2-butene/cis-2-butene ratios (Fig. 5) have been plotted. They should be 0.22 and 1.57, respectively, in ther- modynamic equilibrium at 673 K [29]. Pronounced 1-butene excess can be seen in almost all cases in Fig. 4, and high trcms-2-butene excess is observed above samples supported on HA-1 and HA-3 carbon (Fig. 5). 1-Butene excess was found over unsupported catalysts, but there the ratios were closer to equilibrium [15]. Two reaction routes have been proposed on the basis of those results. Recently Dehnon and Dallons [30] proposed a concerted thiophene HDS reaction mechanism on MoSg-based catalysts. Accordingly, the carbon atoms of the flat-like adsorbed thiophene molecule in positions 2 and 3 are hydrogenated first, followed by hydrogenation in positions 1 and 4. Dehnon and Dallons do not suggest the desorption ofsemi-hydrogenated transition products, but, assuming that the breaking of C S bonds in two separate steps is very probable, the production of 1-butane and its appearance in the gas phase as the main HDS product can be expected. We explained the traws-2-butene excess over unsupported catalysts with a simple concept [15]: accordingly, the production of this isomer is favoured when fewer 'remote' active sites are available, as opposed to that of the cis isomer, which is favoured by more numerous, 'crowded'active sites at lower conver- sions. This concept seems to be valid also over carbon-supported catalysts, 1-bu/2-bu r=0 0.7- a. imp red sul A S B HA-1 V HA-3 0 + x HA-6 0.6- i-bu/2-bu r=0.46 1-bu/2-bu r=1 -s- S \" \\ 0.5 V A 0-5 k-._ A --- Fig. 4. l-butene/2-butenes (1-bu/2-bu) ratios as a function of reaction time (t(min)) measured over various carbon-supported catalysts. 39 /min/ Fig. 5. 7yans-2-butene/cis-2-butene (translcis) ratios as a function of reaction time (((min)) measured over various carbon-supported catalysts. because almost thermodynamic composition of cis-trans isomers was found over the most active HA-6 carbon-supported samples (Fig. 5). Conclusions Synergism has been found to be only a transitional phenomenon cha- racteristic of the initial stages of catalyst life under our activation procedure [17]. In the present work, sometimes CoMo catalysts showed the lowest activity while Mo samples were the most active in the series of Mo, CoMo and Co catalysts; therefore the traditional synergy is not manifested. Sulfidation of molybdenum becomes easier with increasing specific surface area of the catalyst, because differences among conversions of imp, red and sul Mo/C samples decrease, and the HYD values ofsul r=0 catalysts increase compared to imp and red ones with increasing carbon support surface areas. Conversions (CONV) and hydrogenation selectivities (HYD) of molyb- denum-containing (Mo and CoMo) catalysts are less stable with increasing reaction time than those of samples containing only cobalt. Sulfidation of Mo preceded Sulfidation of Co, and that of Mo was more difficult than that of Co, both in unsupported [13] and alumina-supported [18] systems. We propose the same for carbon-supported catalysts, and attribute the more rapid deactivation of Mo-containing samples to the incomplete Sulfidation of Mo and the absence of Sulfidation of Co in CoMo catalysts. CONV and HYD values increase, as a rule, in the following order: prereduced < impregnated < presulfided samples. Prereduction hinders sulfi- 40 dation of both metals because of the probable forming of MoOg and metallic Co. Impregnated and prereduced catalysts cannot be sulfided effectively by the hydrogen/thiophene reaction mixture. CONV and HYD values of Co/C catalysts are comparable with molybdenum- containing ones, not only in presulfided samples [3, 4] but also in impregnated and prereduced catalysts. We explain this result by the existence of some kind of cobalt carbon support interaction, in accordance with [3 6]. The main effect of activation of the support by COg should be an increased specific surface area of the active phase in the following impregnation. Widening of micropores and an increasing number of mesopores during activation of the support favour optimum distribution of the CoMo phase on the support; therefore the HDS activities and HYD selectivities of these catalysts are higher. The reaction route via 1-butene which was originally proposed for unsupported systems [15] is even more likely in carbon-supported catalysts. The composition ofbutene isomers in the reaction mixture is highly dependent on the level of conversion. Acknowledgement Thanks are due to Dr. C.

Korányi Valerii Rozanov 1 Rita Kremó Zoltán Paál Institute of Isotopes of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H-1525 Budapest, P.O. Box 77 Hungary 1 On leave from N.N. Semenov Institute of Chemical Physics, Moscow, U.S.S.R. Thiophene hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activities and product distributions of impregnated Co/C, CoMo/C and Mo/C catalysts were studied at 673 K and atmospheric pressure. Two kinds of pretreatments (prereduction by hydrogen or presulfidation by H2/H2S mixture) were carried out on Co and/or Mo catalysts supported on three kinds of carbon (non-activated, activated by CO2 for 1 h and 10 h). These catalysts were tested in thiophene HDS. Characteristic synergistic effects were not observed, either in thiophene conversions (CONV) or in hydrogenation selectivities (HYD) of butene products of the HDS reaction. The latter values were similar for Co/C and Mo/C catalysts, in contrast to alumina-supported samples. CONV and HYD values of Co/C catalysts were more stable with increasing reaction time than those of Mo-containing samples, and these values decreased in most cases in the following order: presulfided ‘non-pretreated’ prereduced catalysts. The above order and the gradual decrease in CONV and HYD values with increasing Co content of prereduced samples show that reduction of cobalt is not favourable to high CONV and HYD values, because this reduced Co cannot be sulfided by the hydrogen/thiophene reaction mixture and oxidic Co (in non-pretreated samples) cannot be sulflded efficiently in the HDS reaction. High 1-butene and trans-2-butene excesses over thermodynamic equilibrium ratios of butene isomers were found on non-activated and 1 h-activated carbon-supported catalysts, which indicate the predominance of the reaction route producing 1-butene over these supports. Higher specific surface areas of the activated support seem likely to result in higher surface areas of active phase, too, but it presumably cannot prevent the segregation of metallic Co during prereduction. Widening of micropores and the increasing number of mesopores during activation of the support also contribute to the increasing HDS activities and HYD selectivities. References 1 J.C.
