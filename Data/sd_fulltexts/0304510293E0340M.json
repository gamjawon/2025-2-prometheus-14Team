Logan Department ofApplied Physical Sciences, University of Ulster, Coleraine, N. Ireland BT52 ISA, UK (Received October 26. 1993; accepted December 15, 1993) Abstract Deuterium exchange of pyrrolidine, diethylamine and triethylamine over catalysts of Group VIII transition metals was studied by mass spectrometry. On all metals, pyrrolidine and diethylamine showed exchange of the amine hydrogen occurring the most readily. At higher temperatures both compounds showed exchange of the hydrogen atoms of the methylene groups next to the nitrogen atom, and then at yet higher temperatures, exchange of all H atoms. At elevated temperatures, hydrogenolysis of the C-N bond occurs but pyrrolidine engaged in this reaction less readily than did diethylamine. Triethylamine, lacking any amine H atoms, could exchange only alkyl H atoms but its behaviour in this respect showed no clear difference from diethylamine that might be attributed to greater difficulty in being chemisorbed on the metal surface. It is thus concluded that all three compounds initially undergo adsorption at the nitrogen atom.

On nickel, the amine hydrogen (s) reacted readily but there was also some exchange at the methyl hydrogens while on iron, deuterium exchange seemed to be limited to the methyl hydrogens. More recent studies [2] using C3 and C4 primary alkylamines have shown that, on a number of transition metals, whereas deuterium exchange of the amine hydrogens occurs quite readily at around laboratory temperature, at higher temperatures more extensive exchange takes place, involving the hydrogen atoms of the alkyl group. Recent studies with methylhydrazines [3] showed that the exchange was observed of only the hydrazyl hydrogen atoms and that this occurred on most transition metals investigated. It was decided to study the behaviour, on the surface of Group VIII transition metals, of the cyclic amine pyrrolidine. With its five-membered ring, this compound is potentially analogous to cyclopentane, whose behaviour in regard to deuterium exchange proved so interesting [4-6] in connection with the catalytic reactions of alkanes. It was important that similar studies should be carried out with diethylamine, the most comparable non-cyclic compound, but differing from pyrrolidine in that it has no inherent molecular rigidity. Also related to both molecules is triethylamine, in which every H atom is part of an alkyl group. Since for a primary amine [2] on a Group VIII transition metal, the amine hydrogen atoms are the most readily exchanged and this position must represent the site on the molecule at which adsorption on the catalyst first occurs, it would be of obvious interest to see whether the total absence of amine hydrogens means that a tertiary amine is less readily adsorbed on the surface than a secondary amine. The chief aim of the investigation is to determine in what manner the molecules are adsorbed on the transition metal surface when exchange of the alkyl hydrogen atoms takes place. It is appropriate, in this study, to use evaporated films of the relevant Group VIII transition metals, since this represents a reproducible surface of the metal, readily generated just before the experiment. 2. Experimental Amines of Aldrich 99 + % grade were used without further purification. The D, was supplied in sealed bulbs by BOC or by Masonlite, Ltd. and had an isotopic enrichment of > 99%. Samples of highly purified metal wires were supplied by Johnson Matthey, Ltd. Films of ca. 10 mg weight, evaporated from an electrically heated loop of metal wire [7] on to the reaction vessel while the latter was immersed in ice-water, were prepared in high vacuum, after the demountable reaction vessel had been pumped and baked at 350 C for two hours, with the filament outgassed for the last ; h at a current just too low to cause evaporation. The gas mixture was then admitted to the fresh film in the reaction vessel at 0 C just after the end of the film evaporation. From the reaction vessel, a fine capillary leak allowed the reaction mixture to bleed slowly into the AEI MS 10 mass spectrometer at a rate of a few percent per hour. This permitted the contents of the reaction vessel to be continually monitored mass spectrometrically, without any disruption to the reaction [8]. In order to follow the deuterium exchange reaction, it is convenient to choose an electron accelerating voltage at which fragments at S.R. Logan /Journal ofMolecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 365-370 367 m/<.= (p- 1) and (p-2) are kept small but the parent peak is not too much abbreviated. A value of 15 V was chosen for both pyrrolidine and triethylamine and 14 V for diethylamine. In a typical experiment, a standard mixture of amine vapour and D_, pre-mixed, was admitted to the catalyst at 0 C. Thereafter, the relevant parts of the mass spectrum were scanned and the temperature of the catalyst was raised step-wise. The memory effect in the mass spectrometer [9] meant that, after an experiment producing a highly deuterated amine, it was necessary to leak the unexchanged compound into the mass spectrometer before the next run, thus flushing out the weakly adsorbed deuteriumcontaining molecules. In the standard mixture of pyrrolidine and D= the ratio of the partial pressures was 1:5, so that of the \"hydrogen\" atoms present, 53% were D. It was estimated that the maximum possible amount of the molecule C4NDy would be ca. 1 % of that of the d5 isomer, so that the d9 isomer should be detectable. For the studies with diethylamine, the ratio of the partial pressures was 1:4 so that only 42% of the \"hydrogen\" atoms were D. The limit of detection was estimated as the d, isomer. The corresponding figures for triethylamine were 1:5, 40% and the d,3 isomer, C,NHZD,3. Thus the fact that the totally deuterated products were not seen with these molecules can have no mechanistic significance. 3. Results 3.1. Platinum On platinum, pyrrolidine readily yielded the d, isomer at 0 C, presumably by exchange of the amine hydrogen, but no further exchange was observed even at 100 C. At 135 C, multiple exchange occurred, leading to deuterated isomers of the parent ion as far as the d5. The fragment ion at m/z=43, due to CZNHS , also showed all isomers as far as the ds at this point. Since it has been shown [ 10] that this ion is derived from the two carbon atoms adjacent to the nitrogen atom along with the N atom and the \"hydrogens\" attached to all three atoms, clearly exchange is occurring more readily at carbon atoms 2 and 5 than at carbon atoms 3 and 4. Faster exchange occurred at 170 C, where peaks were seen up to the dy isomer of the parent ion, showing that exchange was now occurring at carbon atoms 3 and 4. The behaviour of diethylamine was quite similar. The amine hydrogen exchanged slowly at 0 C, but even at 90 C there was very little formation of the d= isomer. Multiple exchange occurred at 145 C, showing, from the parent ions, up to the dy isomer. The d7 isomer of the m/z=58 fragment, due to the ion NH(CZHs)CH' , was visible at that point, consistent with the view that in this molecule the methylene hydrogens are exchanged more readily than the methyl hydrogens. At this final temperature, decomposition products, particularly ethylamine and ethane, were detected. The reaction of triethylamine with DZ showed no exchange at low temperatures since the molecule has no labile amine hydrogen atoms. Multiple exchange was observed at 135 C and at 180 C up to the d, isomer could be seen, which shows that both methylene and methyl hydrogen atoms were exchanging at that temperature. 368 S.R. Logan l Journal of Molecular Calahsis 89 (1994) 365-370 3.2. Palladium The exchange reaction of pyrrolidine on palladium was very similar, with the d, isomer seen at 0 C, no further exchange apparent even at 95 C, and multiple exchange, giving up to the d9 parent ion, at 135 C. Diethylamine readily yielded its d, isomer, but even at 100 C, only a little of the d= and d3 isomers were to be seen. Multiple exchange occurred at 140 C, leading to up to the dy parent ion and the d, fragment ion at mlz=58, suggesting that the methylene hydrogens exchange more readily than the methyl hydrogens. At 175 C, decomposition was apparent, with triethylamine as one of the products, which is consistent with the hydrogenolysis studies on ethylamine [ 1 1 ] . Triethylamine showed no deuterium exchange up to 80 C but readily underwent multiple exchange at 1 15 C, as far at the d,3 isomer. 3.3. Rhodium On rhodium, pyrrolidine produced the d, isomer at 0 C, and at 50 C it grew more quickly with slow exchange yielding up to the d4 isomer. The m/z = 43 fragment ion also showed the presence of the d4 isomer, suggesting that this exchange was chiefly at carbon atoms 2 and 5. Faster multiple exchange was seen at 95 C, with all isomers apparent up to d9. Diethylamine also yielded the d, isomer at 0 C and up to the d3 isomer at 50 C. More extensive exchange occurred at 105 C, yielding up to the d,, isomer. At 160 C, the d, isomer was seen and decomposition was apparent, with triethylamine as a product. While triethylamine did not show any exchange at 0 C, it underwent multiple exchange at 55 C, yielding up to the d isomer. 3.4. Nickel Pyrrolidine showed no deuterium exchange at 0 C, but the d, isomer was apparent at 65 C. At 130 C, multiple exchange occurred leading to up to the d7 isomer of the parent ion and up to the ds isomer of the m/z=43 fragment ion. Once again, it would seem that the hydrogens on carbons 2 and 5 are exchanged more readily than those on carbons 3 and 4. More extensive exchange occurred at higher temperatures but even at 215 C, very little decomposition was apparent. Diethylamine showed no exchange on nickel at 0 C but the d, isomer was in evidence at 55 C. At 105 C, the d, peak rose more quickly and further exchange was seen up to the d, isomer. At 155 C, more extensive exchange was seen, up to the dy isomer, but decomposition was also occurring with the appearance of triethylamine. Triethylamine showed no exchange even at 60 C, but at 105 C up to the d5 isomer was seen and up to the d, 3 isomer at 155 C. 3.5. Cobalt At the start of the experiment with pyrrolidine, there were significant peaks from various deuterated products of a previous run, a manifestation of the memory effect [9] and it was S.R. Logan /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 365-370 369 not clear whether any exchange was occurring at 0 C. At 60 C, exchange took place leading to all isomers up to the ds, both for the parent ion and for the m/z=43 fragment. More exchange occurred at 110 C, but the highest parent ion seen was the d7 isomer, of which there was merely a hint. It thus appears that exchange was virtually limited to the carbon atoms 2 and 5, along with the N atom. Diethylamine yielded the d, isomer at 60 C, and at 120 C, extensive exchange took place leading to the d, isomer, both in the parent ion and in the fragment ion at m/z=58. At 165 C, larger amounts of these same products were formed and slow decomposition to triethylamine was observed. Triethylamine showed no exchange at 0 C yielding products up to the d , isomer. At 170 C, slow decomposition occurred to ammonia, ethylamine and ethane. 3.6. Iron At 0 C, no exchange of pyrrolidine was observed. At 75 C, exchange took place, leading to d, to d, isomers from both the parent peak and the m/z=43 fragment. At 115 C, there was further growth of these peaks but the parent peak showed no more than the d5 isomer. Thus on iron, exchange is limited to the five H atoms on the N atom and on carbon atoms 2and5. With diethylamine, there was no exchange at 55 C, but the d, isomer grew slowly at 110 C. At 150 C, up to the d4 isomer was seen on the parent and the m/z=58 fragment ions. At 200 C, faster exchange occurred, but the parent ion went only as far as the ds isomer and the 58 fragment only to the d7 isomer, suggesting that the exchange of the H atoms in the methyl groups did not occur readily. With triethylamine, there was no reaction at 55 or at 100 C. At 145 C, up to the d4 isomer was produced slowly, but at 195 C, more extensive exchange occurred going as far as the d isomer. 4. Discussion On these metals, it would seem that pyrrolidine undergoes adsorption first at the N atom, since it is the amine hydrogen which most readily undergoes exchange. Using the fragment ion at mlz=43, there is clear evidence that the exchange of the hydrogens attached to the methylene groups starts at carbons 2 and 5 and in some cases does not progress far beyond this. Where exchange is limited in this way, the most probable cause is that the adsorption to the N atom is so strong that the molecule is not allowed to roll around on the surface, and the greatest restrictions were found with iron and cobalt which, of the six metals studied here, are the two best catalysts for ammonia synthesis and decomposition [ 12] and may thus form the strongest bonds to the N atom. Little difference is apparent between the behaviour of pyrrolidine and its non-cyclic counterpart, diethylamine. The latter does not, unfortunately, yield a large fragment ion at m 1z = 43 [ 13 ] but the mlz = 58 ion, resulting from the loss of a methyl group, enables some information to be gained on which part of the alkyl groups undergoes exchange the more readily and shows that, as with pyrrolidine, this happens at the carbon atoms adjacent to the 370 S.R. Logan /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 365-370 nitrogen. Diethylamine is clearly more readily decomposed than is pyrrolidine and, on all the metals studied except platinum, triethylamine is formed as this occurs. This occurrence is quite consistent with the alkylamines being chemisorbed at the N atom and a neighbouring C atom, so that N-C bond rupture leads to an adsorbed ethyl radical which may be inserted on another N atom. The behaviour of triethylamine in regard to exchange closely resembles that of diethylamine on each metal. While the amine H atom of the latter acts as an indicator of the reversible adsorption of the molecule at the N atom, the lack of an amine hydrogen clearly has minimal effect in regard to the exchange of the H atoms in the alkyl groups. The only abundant fragment ion from triethylamine at low electron energies is at ml =86 which corresponds to the loss of one methyl group, so it is very difficult to prove which group of hydrogens, the six methylene H atoms or the nine methyl H atoms, undergo exchange the more readily. The indications are that it is the former group, consistent with the observed behaviour of pyrrolidine and diethylamine. References [ I ] C. Kemball and F.J. Wolf, Trans.
