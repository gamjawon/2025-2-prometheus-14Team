Beaudry, George W. Wagner* and J. Richard Ward Research Directorate, U.S. Army Chemical Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21010 (USA) (Received August 21, 1991; revised December 9, 1991) Abstract A powder containing sorptive and reactive resins that was developed for the removal and subsequent catalytic degradation of toxic organophosphorus esters is characterized using dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), p-nitrophenyl diphenylphosphate (PNDP), and 3'P MAS NMR. The results for DMMP confirm, spectroscopically, that the adsorbed ester is distributed between the sorptive and reactive resin components. Spectra of the DMMP surface probe adsorbed on the resin are indicative of two different adsorption sites, one possessing a much larger capacity compared with the other. The large-capacity site is identified as the sorptive macroreticular 'porous' region of the resin. The smallercapacity site seems to be associated with the reactive quaternary ammonium hydroxide functional groups of the ion-exchange resin. At each type of site, adsorbed DMMP exhibits 'liquid-like' isotropic motion; however, the molecules do not appear to be able to rapidly migrate between the sorptive and reactive regions. Variable-temperature 3'P MAS NMR results for DMMP demonstrate that any molecular exchange between these sites must be occurring at a rate of less than 300 s-', even at 50 C. PNDP hydrolyzes on the resin powder to yield diphenyl phosphate (DPP) and p-nitrophenoxide. A second 3'P MAS NMR resonance is not observed for PNDP adsorbed at the reactive sites; however, the anionic DPP product appears to be tightly bound by the quaternary amine ionexchange group, which may block further PNDP hydrolysis at the reactive site. Introduction Characterizing chemical reactions on synthetic resins is of current interest in our laboratory, since such resins may be tailored to adsorb and react with toxic organophosphorus esters, which inhibit cholinesterase activity [ 1 ]. In particular, macroreticular resins possess a porous network that should enhance adsorption and provide sites for attachment of reactive functional groups [2, 3]. The U.S. Army recently adopted a kit for skin decontamination that uses macroreticular resins [4] in lieu of natural clays such as 'Fuller's earth'. The resin employed is actually a mixture of three components: a high-surface-area, carbonaceous macroreticular styrene /divinylbenzene resin and two macroreticular styrene/divinylbenzene ion-exchange resins.

All rights reserved 78 strong-acid resin contains sulfonic acid groups, while the strong-base resin has quaternary amine groups. In solution the toxic cholinesterase inhibitors, such as sarin or soman, are rapidly hydrolyzed in strong base and also exhibit acid-catalyzed hydrolysis [5]. In order for the XE-555 resin mixture to function as a catalyst, molecular exchange must take place between the sorptive and reactive sites, and the reactive sites must be able to effect a heterogeneous reaction with the adsorbed liquid. Previous studies in our laboratory with O,O'-diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP) have suggested that a distribution occurs within the resin mixture [6]. Evidence for this distribution is the apparent low reactivity observed for DFP adsorbed on the resin, despite the apparent high reactivity with the individual reactive resin components. The nature of this distribution must be understood in order to design effective systems that both adsorb and react with liquid contaminant. This study employed 3'P Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) NMR to probe the adsorption and reaction of organophosphorus esters at the molecular level. Dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP, CHsP(O)(OCH3)2) and p-nitrophenyl diphenylphosphate (PNDP, P(O)(OCrHB)2(OCBH4NO2)) were used. DMMP was chosen as a probe for adsorption sites because the ester is stable toward hydrolysis [7]. To test the XE-555 as a reactive resin, we used PNDP, which has already been shown in solution to be susceptible to acid- and base-catalyzed hydrolysis [7]. 31P MAS NMR is perhaps uniquely suited for this purpose, since NMR can not only distinguish various molecular adsorption sites [8-10], but also determine the occurrence and rate of molecular exchange between adsorption sites [ 11-15 ]. Experimental Dimethyl methylphosphonate, purchased from Aldrich, was used without further purification (31P NMR indicated a purity of ca. 98%). Para-nitrophenyl diphenylphosphate, provided by Dr. F. R. Longo, CRDEC, was found to be greater than 99% pure by 31P NMR. Ambergard XE-555 Resin, Amberlite IRA-900 Strong Base Resin, Amberlyst XN-1010 Strong Acid Resin, and Ambersorb XE-348F Carbonaceous Synthetic Adsorbent were obtained from Rohm and Haas. The latter three materials are similar to the components in the XE-555 resin powder. The IRA-900, XN-1010, and XE-348F resins, manufactured in the form of small beads, were crushed with a ball mill to yield fine powders. The strong-base IRA-900 resin, initially in the chloride form, was exchanged with an aqueous 5% NaOH solution to yield the hydroxide form. The resin was subsequently washed. with de-ionized water to remove NaCl and excess NaOH and then filtered and dried in air at room temperature. DUMP liquid was loaded onto the resins by stirring weighed amounts of the resin with weighed amounts of DMMP in a small vial. DMMP vapor was loaded onto the resins by drawing air through a glass pipet containing a small plug of cotton impregnated with a few drops of DMMP. The vapor 79 was allowed to pass through another pipet containing the resin placed between the DMMP vapor source and the vacuum. Prior to vapor loadings, resins were pre-equilibrated with room air by drawing air through the pipet containing the resin for a few hours. The difference in the weight of the pipet containing the resin before and after the vapor loading was taken to reflect the amount of DMMP adsorbed and was used to calculate the approximate weight-percent loading. No attempt was made to measure the amount of water lost during the vapor-loading process. PNDP solid was loaded onto the resins by dissolving the compound in 95% (v/v) ethanol/water; the solution was then slurried with the resin in a Petri dish and allowed to evaporate at room temperature in a fume hood. Solution 31P NMR spectra were obtained at 82 MHz on a Varian XL200 NMR spectrometer. 31P MAS NMR spectra were obtained at 101 MHz using high-power proton decoupling on a home-built 6 T FT-NMR spectrometer equipped with a Doty Scientific variable-temperature 5 mm double-tuned MAS probe. 31P spin-lattice relaxation times (Tl) of less than 2 s were observed for adsorbed DMMP and PNDP, which are much less than their solution values. The short Tl values alleviate the need for the cross-polarization (CP) technique and favor the more quantitative conventional FT experiment. More importantly, the highly mobile, liquid-like species are not observable using CP owing to motional averaging of the 1H 31P dipolar interaction. Therefore, the conventional PT experiment was used. Spectra were typically obtained using 45 (4 gs) observe pulses with a 5 s relaxation delay between scans. All chenucal shifts were referenced to an 'external sample of 85% H3PO4. Positive chemical shifts are at higher frequency (lower field) than the reference. Various reaction products were solvent-extracted from the resins and their structures determined using 31P, 13C, 1H, and two-dimensional 1H-1H COSY NMR techniques. Results for dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) The first phase of the study involves identifying the various adsorption sites on the XE-555 resin powder. DMMP is an ideal candidate for this purpose because it is a small, simple molecule that is stable except at very high or low pH [ 7 ]. Therefore, the molecule is not expected to react with the acid or base groups on the XE-555 resin. This surface probe permits NMR spectra to be obtained that are not complicated by interfering reaction products and allows for the straightforward observation of chemically different adsorption sites. 31P NMR spectra of DMMP vapor adsorbed on the XE-555 resin powder are shown in Fig. 1. The top spectrum, (a), was obtained under normal solution NMR conditions and reveals two overlapping peaks at 38 and 29 ppm. The relative narrowness of these resonances immediately indicates that DMMP is undergoing fast isotropic `liquid-like' motions on the resin that 80 100 SO O Fig. 1. 3'P NMR spectra of DMMP vapor-loaded on the resin powder (less than b weightpercent) obtained using (a) normal solution NMR conditions and (b) MAS and high-power proton decoupling. average the broad chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) powder pattern expected for static organophosphorus esters [ 16-191. The bottom spectrum, (b), was obtained. using MAS with high-power proton decoupling. This technique greatly enhances the resolution of the twin peaks as compared with the spectrum obtained without MAS. The source of the difference in linewidth between the two spectra appears to be primarily attributable to CSA effects rather than 'H a1P dipolar interactions, since spectra obtained using MAS without proton decoupling yield linewidths identical to those in spectrum 1(b). The narrow, downfield resonance occurs at 36.2 ppm, which is the same value observed for DMMP in methanol solution. Methanol extraction of the DMMP from the resin results in only DMMP in the filtrate; thus DMMP does not react with the resin, but in fact resides in two different adsorption sites. The spectra further show that any molecular exchange occurring between the two sites is slow on the NMR time scale (1-10-8 s) by virtue of the presence of both individual resonances [201. For equally populated sites, the 1000 Hz separation of the two peaks requires an exchange rate of ca. 2200 s-' in order for coalescence to occur [201. Clearly, the actual exchange rate is much slower than this value. The exchange rate is further constrained by the linewidth of the downfield peak (ca. 100 Hz), which dictates an upper limit on the exchange rate of 300 s-' at room temperature. In order to identify the nature of the two adsorption sites, 3'P MAS NMR spectra were obtained for DMMP vapor adsorbed on the three individual 81 resins similar to the components in the XE-555 resin powder. These spectra are shown in Fig. 2. The rather broad resonance detected for DMMP adsorbed on the carbonaceous macroreticular adsorbent at 33 ppm (2(a)) is slightly shifted from the solution value of 36 ppm and indicates that the molecules are rather rigidly held, as evidenced by the CSA sidebands (spinning frequency 3300 Hz). Conversely, DMMP remains highly mobile on the macroreticular strong-base and strong-acid ion-exchange resins (2(b), (c)) yielding sharp resonances at 36.9 and 36.3 ppm, respectively. MAS is least effective at reducing linewidths when the condition v2(oT,,=1 (oir= spinning rate, 7c = correlation time) occurs [15], and slow molecular motions in this vicinity will produce broad lines in MAS spectra. However, variable-temperature experiments performed on the sample of DMMP vapor adsorbed on the macroreticular carbonaceous adsorbent demonstrate that the linewidth is temperature independent up to 50 C. Furthermore, varying the spinning speed, which should have an observable effect on the linewidth of a sample in the slow motion regime [ 151, is also ineffective at altering the linewidth of this sample. Therefore, surface heterogeneity appears to be the major factor responsible for the large residual linewidth of spectrum - __JL__ . , (b) _JL_ (c) l00 50 O -50 PPM Fig. 2. 3'P MAS NMR spectra of DMMP vapor-loaded on (a) carbonaceous macroreticular adsorbent, 15 weight-percent; (b) macroreticular strong-base resin, ca. 3 weight-percent; (c) macroreticular strong-acid resin, 44 weight-percent. 82 2(a). Surface heterogeneity is apparently overcome by the rapid motions of the highly mobile `liquid-like' species detected in spectra 2(b) and (c). Only in the spectrum of the strong-base resin, 2(b), does a second signal occur at 25.5 ppm. Therefore, the second site is associated with DMMP adsorbed at quaternary ammonium hydroxide base sites. A second signal is not detected for DMMP adsorbed on the strong-acid resin, 2(c), but this does not rule out the possibility of DMMP adsorption at sulfonic acid sites. This resonance could be coincident with the sorptive signal. A complete listing of `P MAS NMR assignments for DMMP adsorbed on the various resins is given in Table 1. 3'P MAS NMR spectra obtained from samples of various DMMP weightpercent loadings hldicate that adsorption at the base sites is favored during small-weight-percent vapor loadings. Conversely, the macroreticular region is allowed to fill at large-weight-percent liquid loadings. The relative ratio of the areas of the two resonances in all of these spectra did not change over a period of several months, indicating that the DMMP distribution achieved during the loading process is stable at room temperature. The relative capacities of the two sites are in keeping with the expected greater capacity of the macroreticular adsorption sites, yet DMMP in the smallweight-percent vapor-loaded samples does not redistribute to maintain a constant occupancy ratio between the sites. A reasonable explanation for the adsorption behavior of the XE-555 resin powder is that the reactive sites facilitate the adsorption of DMMP vapor into the macroreticular region. This can be rationalized by taking into account the fact that DMMP is very soluble in water, which is expected to be predominantly adsorbed at the ion-exchange sites. The reported water content of the strong-base and -acid resins are ca. 70% and 50ss'o, respectively. It is interesting to note that in contrast to the macroreticular acid and base ion-exchange resins, DMMP vapor adsorbed on the carbonaceous macroreticular resin (which contains only about 2% water) is rather rigidly held. Thus mobile `liquid-like' DMMP does not seem to be able to form in the pore structure of this resin during the DMMP vapor exposure times examined, TABLE 1 3'P MAS NMR assignments for organophosphorus esters adsorbed on varioNs resins Ester XE-555 XE-348F IRA-900(OH') XN-1~Q19 DMMP 36.28 33' 36.9' 36.aa 26.3b 25.5 PNDP -17.9 -17.8 -17.1 -17.9 DPP -10.1 - -9.6 - DPPA - - - -10.7 PNPPA - - - -11.7 'Macroreticular region. \"Quaternary ammonium hydroxide ion-exchange sites. 83 whereas the ion-exchange resins axe able to rapidly adsorb DMMP vapor to yield liquid-like DMMP in their pores. All three resins rapidly assimilate DMMP liquid to yield adsorbed DMMP that is highly mobile and liquid-like. The possibility of chemical exchange between the macroreticular sorptive region and the reactive base sites was further investigated by variabletemperature 31P MAS NMR. Variable-temperature spectra recorded at temperatures up to 50 C for DMMP vapor adsorbed on both the XE-555 resin powder and the strong-base ion-exchange resin (not shown) yield no features attributable to molecular exchange. On the contrary, at the higher temperatures the lines actually sharpen owing to the increased rate of motion of the molecules within their respective adsorption environments. If molecular exchange were occurring between the sites at a rate approaching the width of the resonances (ca. 100 Hz), then a significant line-broadening contribution would be evident as the temperature is raised. Therefore, molecular exchange is very slow (less than 300 s-1) even at 50 C. Site exchange might be observable by NMR above this temperature; however, the quaternary ammonium hydroxide groups begin to decompose at ca. 60 C. The variabletemperature spectra were reversible within the temperature range studied. Magnetization-transfer experiments [ 11, 13, 14 ] could be used to further characterize the exchange process, and these experiments are planned for future work. It should be noted that molecular exchange between the sites must occur at an appreciable rate in order for the resin to function as an effective catalyst. The lack of a fast exchange, as seen for DMMP, could account for the slow reaction rate found for DFP in our previous study [ 6 ] . Results for p-nitrophenyl diphenylphosphate (PNDP) Unlike the DMMP surface probe, PNDP is expected to be more unstable with respect to hydrolysis [21-31 ] and, thereby, to react with the acid and base groups in the XE-555 resin powder. In basic solution, the major hydrolysis products are diphenylphosphate (DPP) and p-nitrophenoxide (a yellow chromophore), although significant amounts of p-nitrophenyl phenylphosphate (PNPP) and phenoxide also form [21, 24]. For acid catalysis, diphenyl phosphoric acid and p-nitrophenol are the sole reported products [31 ], which differ from the analogous base-catalyzed products only in that they are protonated at the reaction pH. PNDP is a white solid at room temperature, which necessitates the use of a solvent in order to load the compound onto the resin. PNDP is insoluble in water but is soluble in 95% (v/v) ethanol/water. Solutions prepared in this solvent are fairly stable and yield no hydrolysis products even after standing for several days. 31P MAS NMR spectra of PNDP adsorbed on the XE-555 resin powder from 959'0 (v/v) ethanol/water solution are shown in Fig. 3. Two peaks are present, at -10.1 and -17.9 ppm, in the spectrum of a 1-day-old sample, 84 100 50 0 -50 -100 PPM (b) Fig. 3. g'P MAS NO spectra of PNDP adsorbed on the resin powder from ethanol solution: (a) 1-day-old sample, capped to retain solvent; (b) 23-day-old sample, capped to retain solvent; (c) same as (b) except that the sample remained exposed to ambient humidity. 3(a). The large, upfield peak at -17.9 ppm, which has the same chemical shift as that observed for PNDP in solution [211, is assigned to PNDP adsorbed on the macroreticular region of the resin. The spectrum observed for adsorbed PNDP is different from the spectrum of neat PNDP solid*, indicating that the ester does not merely precipitate as the ethanol evaporates; rather, it appears that a relatively high dispersion must be achieved. The lack of spinning sidebands for the two peaks indicates that both adsorbed PNDP *The room-temperature 9'P MAS NMR spectrum of neat PNDP solid yields two resonances, at -17.9 and -12.6 ppm, which also display completely isotropic CSAs indicative of rapid isotropic molecular tumbling within the crystal lattice of the solid. The relative intensity of the two signals varies smoothly as the temperature is raised, with the downneld resonance nearly disappearing just prior to the melting point at ca. 50 C. As the temperature is lowered, a rather abrupt onset of an observable CSA occurs at ca. -45 C, where the two resonances are of equal intensity. This implies the presence of two equally populated crystal lattice sites in the rigid phase formed at this temperature. Similar behavior has recently been observed for crystalline phosphoric acid, although only a single resonance is detected in the lowtemperature rigid phase of this solid [32]. 85 and the other adsorbed species are highly mobile and `liquid-like'. The small, downfield peak at -10.1 ppm is due to the hydrolysis product, DPP, as confirmed by extraction and analysis by solution NMR [21 ]; however, no PNPP product is detected. A sharp resonance due to neutral DPPA is not observed, indicating the absence of a substantial amount of this acid-catalyzed product (vide infra). Thus the observed DPP hydrolysis product demonstrates that the reactive sites are accessible to PNDP, although no distinct signal is observed for PNDP adsorbed at the acid/base sites. The inability to observe PNDP adsorbed at reactive sites is consistent with rapid hydrolysis of PNDP upon its arrival at the site. Solvents play a major role in polymer-supported solution-phase catalysis [2, 33], and ordinarily the XE-555 resin powder would contain only adsorbed water. Therefore, the effect of co-adsorbed ethanol/water on the reaction was investigated in the following experiment. A PNDP/ethanol loaded sample was allowed to dry in air just to the point where no visible solvent remained, at which time a portion of the sample was removed and placed in a capped 5 mm NMR tube. The rest of the sample remained exposed to air in order to allow further, unrestricted loss of ethanol and equilibration with ambient moisture. The portions were allowed to stand for 23 days before their 31P MAS NMR spectra were recorded. These spectra are shown in Figs. 3(b) and (c). For the capped sample (3(b)), the conversion of PNDP to DPP is nearly complete, with only a small signal remaining for unreacted PNDP. Also note that the signal for DPP lacks CSA spinning sidebands, indicating that the product is still very liquid-like. However, the spectrum of the airexposed portion (3(c)) reveals a reduced conversion, along with a DPP product that is being very rigidly held by the resin. These results suggest that either co-adsorbed ethanol or water facilitates the hydrolysis reaction. The relative amounts of highly mobile ethanol and water retained by the resin can be estimated using 1H MAS NMR (which is able to clearly resolve the methyl and methylene resonances of ethanol and the water signal), but the signals due to less mobile ethanol and water would be extremely broad owing to 1H-1H dipolar interactions and, therefore, undetectable. Examination of a sample at various stages during the evaporation process reveals that ethanol is lost from the resin at a much faster rate than water. Thus even though a considerable amount of mobile water is detected on the XE-555 resin at the end of the brief drying period employed in the above experiment, no highly mobile ethanol remains. In the case of the air-exposed sample, the amount of mobile adsorbed water continually declines, with concurrent broadening of the signal, until an apparent equilibrium is achieved with ambient moisture. The effectiveness of water at enhancing PNDP hydrolysis on the XE555 resin was investigated in an experiment in which a loaded/dried sample was wetted with water, allowed to evaporate to a dry appearance, and stored in a capped 5 mm NMR tube. After 4 days, 31P MAS NMR revealed that only slightly more PNDP hydrolysis had occurred, although the DPP product remained highly mobile. The sample was then wetted with ethanol, evaporated 86 to a dry appearance, and stored in a capped 5 mm tube for 3 days. This final treatment resulted in nearly complete conversion of the remaining PNDP to a highly mobile DPP product. Therefore, the presence of ethanol in the capped sample, even though it is not very mobile, as determined by 1H MAS NMR, appears to be effective at enhancing PNDP hydrolysis. At first glance, the increased mobility detected for DPP in the presence of co-adsorbed ethanol/water might suggest that migration of the product away from the active site may be responsible for enhancing PNDP hydrolysis. However, the rate of hydrolysis could also be increased by a greater PNDP mobility in the presence of co-adsorbed ethanol*. Further experimental evidence favors the latter explanation for the following reasons: (1) complete hydrolysis occurs in less than 4 days when a substoichiometric amount of PNDP loaded on the XE-555 resin is left in contact with a copious amount of ethanol in a sealed vial, (2) neither ethanol nor water extracts DPP into solution (in fact, acidification is necessary to dislodge the product from the resin), and (3) no turnover is observed when the XE-555 resin is left in contact with an ethanol solution containing excess PNDP. Therefore, these findings suggest that enhanced PNDP hydrolysis in the presence of coadsorbed ethanol is due to increased PNDP mobility, whereas the DPP product remains a stable intermediate at the reactive base sites. To determine the reactivity of PNDP with the various components of the XE-555 resin powder, \"P MAS spectra were also recorded for PNDP adsorbed on the carbonaceous macroreticular adsorbent and the strong-acid and strong-base macroreticular ion-exchange resins. These spectra are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Spectrum 4(a) of PNDP adsorbed on the carbonaceous macroreticular adsorbent yields a single peak, at -17.8 ppm, which confirms the previous assignment of this resonance to PNDP adsorbed in the macroreticular region. As expected, no reaction products are observed on this purely sorptive component. PNDP adsorbed on the strong-base resin hydrolyzes in the same manner as on the XE-555 resin powder, as indicated by the peak at - 9.6 ppm in spectrum 4(b), which is similarly assigned to the hydrolysis product DPP. In support of this assignment, the initially tan strongbase resin rapidly becomes yellow after being slurried with the PNDP/ethanol solution, consistent with the release of the p-nitrophenoxide chromophore. The strong-base resin further parallels the XE-555 resin powder behavior in that the spectrum of an air-exposed 15-day-old sample, 4(d), also shows a poor conversion along with a large CSA for the immobilized DPP product, whereas the capped control sample (spectrum 4(c)) yields a much better conversion along with a highly mobile liquid-like DPP product. 1H MAS NMR detects no residual highly mobile ethanol in either sample; but the capped sample contains a larger amount of highly mobile co-adsorbed water. Again, these findings are consistent with the DPP anion remaining bound to the quaternary amine ion-exchange sites and enhanced PNDP mobility in the presence of co-adsorbed ethanol. \"Suggested by one of the referees of this manuscript. 87 (a) (c) (d) y 100 50 ft. 4. 3'P MAS NO spectra of PNDP adsorbed on (a) carbonaceous macroreticular adsorbent, 1 day old, capped to retain solvent; (b) macroreticular strong-base resin, 1 day old, capped to retain solvent; (c) macroreticular strong-base resin, 15 days old, capped to retain solvent; (d) same as (c) except that the sample remained exposed to ambient humidity. -50 -100 PPM Spectra obtained for PNDP adsorbed on the strong-acid resin, Fig. 5, are quite different from the spectra obtained for both the XE-555 resin powder and strong-base resin. Again, the peak at -17.9 ppm in the spectrum of the 1-day-old sample, 5(a), is due to PNDP adsorbed in the macroreticular region. The peaks at -10.7 ppm and -11.7 ppm axe due to the acidcatalyzed hydrolysis products, diphenyl phosphoric acid (DPPA) and pnitrophenyl phenyl phosphoric acid (PNPPA), as determined by extraction and NMR characterization of these species in solution. The spectrum taken after the sample had been kept for 40 days in a capped 5 mm NMR tube, 5(b), shows further hydrolysis of PNDP, with DPPA apparently being the favored product. Solvent extraction of the strong-acid resin yields the same relative amounts of PNDP, DPPA, and PNPPA in the filtrate, indicating that the products are easily removed and not tightly bound to the sulfonic acid ion-exchange sites. Spectrum 5(c) was obtained from the same sample after it had been exposed to air for 6 days and shows further DPPA and PNPPA formation, along with the appearance of a third peals, at - 4.4 ppm (product not identified). Even after long-term air exposure, the neutral acid products on the strong-acid resin remain highly mobile and liquid-like under ambient humidity conditions, indicating an increased mobility of the neutral species as compared with the anionic base-catalyzed products. 88 (a) (b) ' -i- -i- ' ' ' 'i (c) 20 0 -20 -y0 PPM Fig. 5. 3'P MAS NMR spectra of PNDP adsorbed on the macroreticular strong-acid resin: (a) 1 day old, capped to retain solvent; (b) 40 days old, capped to retain solvent; (c) same as (b) except that the sample was left exposed to ambient humidity for 6 additional days. Conclusions 31P MAS NMR spectra of DMMP adsorbed on the XE-555 resin powder provide direct evidence for a distribution of adsorbed organophosphorus ester between two different adsorption sites. Comparison of spectra obtained for DMMP adsorbed on strong-acid and strong-base ion-exchange resins and a carbonaceous macroreticular adsorbent (the three components of the XE555 resin powder) allow the assignment of the two adsorption sites to the macroreticular region and the quaternary ammonium hydroxide ion-exchange sites. No resonance is detected for DMMP adsorbed at sulfonic acid ionexchange sites. Variable-temperature spectra obtained for DMMP adsorbed on both the XE-555 resin powder and the strong-base ion-exchange resin indicate that DMMP exchange between the macroreticular region and the quaternary amine sites cannot be occurring at a rate greater than 300 s-1. Magnetization-transfer experiments [11, 13, 14] would enable the calculation of more precise migration rates for organophosphorus esters adsorbed on 89 these synthetic resin catalysts. We are currently modifying our spectrometer so that we can perform these experiments in-house. The results obtained for the hydrolysis of PNDP adsorbed on the XE555 resin powder (from ethanol solution) reveal that the anionic DPP product appears to be tightly bound to the quaternary amine ion-exchange sites under ambient humidity conditions. Co-adsorbed ethanol increases the rate of PNDP hydrolysis, which is attributed to increased PNDP mobility. Product immobilization does not occur for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis on the strong-acid resin where the neutral DPPA and PNPPA products remain highly mobile, even at ambient humidity. However, detectable amounts of the acid-catalyzed products are not formed on the XE-555 resin powder. The reason for the apparent lack of reactivity of the XE-555 sulfonic acid groups remains unclear. Acknowledgements We acknowledge Dr. D.

Beaudry George W. Wagner 1 J. Richard Ward Research Directorate, U.S. Army Chemical Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21010 USA 1 National Research Council—CRDEC Research Associate A powder containing sorptive and reactive resins that was developed for the removal and subsequent catalytic degradation of toxic organophosphorus esters is characterized using dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), p-nitrophenyl diphenylphosphate (PNDP), and 31P MAS NMR. The results for DMMP confirm, spectroscopically, that the adsorbed ester is distributed between the sorptive and reactive resin components. Spectra of the DMMP surface probe adsorbed on the resin are indicative of two different adsorption sites, one possessing a much larger capacity compared with the other. The large-capacity site is identified as the sorptive macroreticular ‘porous’ region of the resin. The smaller-capacity site seems to be associated with the reactive quaternary ammonium hydroxide functional groups of the ion-exchange resin. At each type of site, adsorbed DMMP exhibits ‘liquid-like’ isotropic motion; however, the molecules do not appear to be able to rapidly migrate between the sorptive and reactive regions. Variable-temperature 31P MAS NMR results for DMMP demonstrate that any molecular exchange between these sites must be occurring at a rate of less than 300 s−1, even at 50 °C. PNDP hydrolyzes on the resin powder to yield diphenyl phosphate (DPP) and p-nitrophenoxide. A second 31P MAS NMR resonance is not observed for PNDP adsorbed at the reactive sites; however, the anionic DPP product appears to be tightly bound by the quaternary amine ion-exchange group, which may block further PNDP hydrolysis at the reactive site.
