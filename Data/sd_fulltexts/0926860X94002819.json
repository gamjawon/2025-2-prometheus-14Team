The selectivity of these catalysts towards crotyl alcohol in the gas-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde was considerably increased when the activated carbon support was slightly oxidized before the metal incorporation.

Introduction Unsaturated alcohols form a very important group of compounds for the chemical industry, especially for the synthesis of fine chemicals. The catalytic hydrogenation of c~,/3-unsaturated aldehydes to give unsaturated alcohols is not easy, given that the olefinic double bond is preferentially reduced, both by kinetic and thermody- namic considerations, and the yield of unsaturated alcohol is usually low. Mono- metallic platinum catalysts usually hydrogenate the C=C bond with a 100% selectivity and it is necessary to promote the metal to obtain a certain selectivity towards the desired unsaturated alcohol. Support effects [ 1 ] and addition of other metals such as tin [2], iron [3] and nickel [4] have been claimed to improve the selectivity of platinum catalysts towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond. This communication reports the beneficial effect of oxygen surface groups on the support in the vapor-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol on activated carbon-supported monometallic platinum catalysts. * Corresponding author.

Experimental The parent support (AC) was an activated carbon prepared from olive stones by carbonization in flowing nitrogen (2 h, 1123 K) and further activation with steam ( 100 cm3 rain i, 3 h, 1223 K) ; after hydrochloric acid washing the carbon support had a BET surface area of 960 m2 g- ~ (N2 77 K) and an ash content lower than 0.1 wt.-%. Oxygen surface complexes were introduced into the carbon AC by oxidation in aqueous 12 N H202 at room temperature, thus yielding the support ACox. A third support, ACox5, was obtained by heat treatment of ACox in flowing nitrogen at 773 K for 2 h in such a way that the less stable oxygen surface groups are decomposed and removed. Catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the supports with Pt(NH3)4CI2 in aqueous solutions (pH=9.5) of concentrations required to achieve a metal content of about 1 wt.-% Pt. The amount and thermal stability of the oxygen surface complexes on the supports were determined in the fresh catalysts by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments in flow- ing helium; carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide evolving as decomposition prod- ucts of the oxygen surface complexes were measured with a mass spectrometer. Catalysts were subjected to an 'in situ' pretreatment including the decomposition of the supported metal precursor in helium (2 h, 673 K) and the subsequent reduction in hydrogen ( 12 h, 623 K). This two-step treatment assures a better metal dispersion in catalysts prepared from Pt(NH3)4C12 than when decomposition- reduction in hydrogen is used, as reported previously [5 ]. The platinum dispersion was evaluated by hydrogen chemisorption and carbon monoxide chemisorption at 298 K, and the catalytic behavior in the gas-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde was determined in a microflow reactor at atmospheric pressure, at temperatures ranging between 313 and 380 K, and under differential conditions to avoid mass transfer limitations. The reaction mixture (50 cm3 min ~) was prepared by passing hydrogen through a saturator containing crotonaldehyde ( > 99.5% purity, Fluka) thermostated at 293 K; the reaction products were analyzed by on-line gas chro- matography. 3. Results and discussion The three supports used in this study differ mainly in the amount and type of oxygen surface groups on their surface, as evidenced by temperature-programmed desorption studies [ 6 ]. The oxidation treatment of carbon AC generated both acidic groups desorbing as carbon dioxide upon heating (which were nearly absent in the parent support, AC) and less acidic complexes decomposing as carbon monoxide at higher temperatures. On the other hand, carbon ACox5 contains mainly carbon monoxide-yielding complexes, as the more acidic ones (those decomposing as carbon dioxide) were removed during the thermal treatment at 773 K.

Effect of the reaction temperature on the catalytic activity of the Pt/activated carbon catalysts. The platinum dispersion is highly dependent on the amount of oxygen surface groups on the support and, more precisely, on the amount of acidic complexes. Dispersion values (Had/Pt) of 0.24 (Pt/AC), 0.20 (Pt/ACox5) and 0.09 (Pt/ ACox) indicate the apparently harmful effect of the above-mentioned surface groups. In order to test the possibility of erroneous estimation of the metal disper- sions due to hydrogen spillover, carbon monoxide chemisorption at 298 K was also determined, the resulting dispersions being very similar to those obtained from hydrogen chemisorption if a COad/Pt~ ratio of 1 is assumed. Furthermore, the differences in dispersion were also confirmed by the results obtained in the benzene hydrogenation reaction at 323 K [ 6], a reaction that is considered as being structure insensitive on platinum catalysts. The explanation of the influence of the oxygen surface complexes on metal dispersion could be as follows: at the high pH used during the impregnation step, the more acidic complexes (mainly carboxylic groups) readily interact with the cationic platinum precursor, becoming strong anchoring centers for the Pt(NHs)2 + ions; the removal of these centers during the heat treatment in helium at 673 K or even during the further reduction step would favor the surface mobility of the platinum precursor species and thus a lower metal dispersion. The results show that the higher dispersion values are obtained in catalysts whose support contained a smaller amount of carbon dioxide-yielding complexes. Turnover frequencies (molecules of crotonaldehyde reacted per surface platinum atom and hour) at different reaction temperatures are plotted in Arrhenius' coor- dinates in Fig. 1 for the three catalysts studied. At first is noticeable the different L4 F.

Evolution of the selectivity to crotyl alcohol with the conversion degree. slope of the Pt/AC catalyst plot with respect to its counterparts with oxidized supports, with a subsequent higher value of the apparent activation energy of the overall reaction (34 kJ/mol for Pt/AC versus 24 and 22 kJ/mol for Pt/ACo and Pt/ACox, respectively). The higher turnover numbers obtained with catalyst Pt/ ACox might be attributed to the structure-sensitive character of the reaction, in such a way that it would be favored on large platinum particles. However, the metallic dispersion in catalysts Pt/AC and Pt/ACox5 is rather similar, but the catalytic behavior of Pt/ACo approaches that of Pt/ACo~. Furthermore, the Ea values for reaction on Pt/ACo~ and Pt/ACox5 are nearly the same and lower than that obtained with Pt/AC. Thus, these results indicate that the metallic particle size is not the main origin of the enhanced activity of platinum supported on oxidized activated carbons, the enhancement being due to the amount and nature of the oxygen surface groups of the support. The products of the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde under the reaction condi- tions used were butyraldehyde, crotyl alcohol, butanol and butane, the latter two in small amounts ( < 5% molar fraction). Initially, the selectivity is governed by the preferential hydrogenation of either the C=C bond or the C=O bond, yielding butyraldehyde in the first case and crotyl alcohol in the latter. Further reactions of the primary species formed can also modify the selectivity and consequently it is necessary to compare the behavior of the catalysts as a function of the total con- version of crotonaldehyde. The variation of the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol is plotted versus the conversion degree for the different catalysts in Fig. 2. Whereas catalyst Pt/AC yields only about 4% crotyl alcohol over the whole range of con- F. Coloma et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) L1-L5 L5 versions studied, a much higher selectivity is obtained with the catalysts with oxidized supports. The selectivity towards butanol and butane is similar on the three catalysts, which means that the improved selectivity towards crotyl alcohol of Pt/ACox5 and, in a higher proportion, of Pt/ACox is obtained at the expense of a lower production of butyraldehyde. The results show that the introduction of oxygen surface groups on the carbon support greatly modifies the catalytic behavior of platinum in the gas-phase hydro- genation of crotonaldehyde, yielding more active catalysts (in terms of turnover frequencies) and enhancing the selective hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond, which results in an improved selectivity towards the a,/3-unsaturated alcohol.
