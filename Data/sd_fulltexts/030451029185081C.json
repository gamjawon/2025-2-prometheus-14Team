A. K. Du Plessis* and H. C. M. Vosloo Department of Chemistry, Potchefstroom University for CHE, Potchefstroom 2520 (South Africa) Abstract Mo(CO)e and Cp2Moa(CO)e with added phenol, 3-chlorophenol or iodine catalysed the polymerization and, to a lesser degree, the trimerization of alkynes, but if a mixture of iodine and phenol was added, an increase in trtmer yield was observed. The Iz reacted with the molybdenum carbonyl compounds, while the phenol associated with the alkynes to activate the system. With disubstituted alkynes, metathesis products were also formed. Introduction By using molybdenum carbonyl compounds as catalysts, alkynes can be cyclotrimerized, polymerized or metathesized in the presence of a phenolic compound [1]. Only disubstituted alkynes give metathesis products. The first homogeneous catalytic system found for the metathesis of alkynes involved a mixture of Mo(CO)e and phenol (!]. Devarajan and Walton [2] believed that the phenol interacted with the carbonyl compound to provide an unstable intermediate such as 'MoCCCQa' which promoted the metathesis reaction. Bencheick et al. [3] suggested that the phenol associated with the alkyne to remove some of its acetylenic character through hydrogen bonding with the acetylenic bond. This association made the scrambling of the alkyi units in the metallocyclobutadiene that formed as intermediate, possible. There are however, some molybdenum carbonyl compounds such as [Mo(CO)3(NH3)3] and [MoCCCOaCCHaCI^] that catalyze the metathesis re- action without the addition of phenols [2]. Experimental Alkynes C5X10\"3 mol) were added under a dry nitrogen atmosphere into an ampule that contained a solution of the molybdenum compound Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/91/S3.50 Elsevler Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 52 (5X10\"5 mol Mo), phenol compound (5xl0~3 mol) and/or la (5xl0~4 mol) and 2 cm3 of the solvent. The ampule was sealed and heated for 18 h at 110 C. After cooling the ampule was opened, an internal standard (chlorophenol or trans-decalin) was added as well as 0.03 cm3 water to destroy the catalyst. GC measurements were undertaken with a Carlo Erba 4100 gas chromatograph (fused silica capillary column, FS-Se-30 CB-0.25; 20 mxO.32 nun i.d.). Identification of products was done by GC-MS mea- surements. The difference between the total amount of alkynes and their products calculated to be present in the sample and that found experimentally is used as an indication of the amount of polymers formed.

The main types of products obtained are compounds formed by metathesis, cyclotrimerization and polymerization. In some cases, adducts between the alkynes and iodine and also with 3- chlorophenol were formed. Metathesis products were found only with the disubstituted alkyne, hex- 2-yne (Table 1.1). Under the conditions used, Mo(CO)e is the better catalyst, forming with hex-2-yne 10% metathesis products in the presence of phenol, while with CpgMozCCC^e as catalyst, only 2% were formed. The addition of iodine also activated the system, but less than 1% metathesis products could be observed. In the cases studied hex-2-yne gave a relatively low yield of polymers (less than 40%) and trimers could be observed in a few cases. With hex-1-yne (Table 1.2) a relatively higher yield of polymers and trimers was observed. The combination of CpaMo2(CO)g with 3-chlorophenol gave the highest yield of polymers while the mixtures of iodine and phenol with Cp2Mo2(CO)e or with Mo(CO)e favoured the formation of trimers. On using phenylacetylene (Table 1.3) the polymer yield was even higher in comparison to that obtained by hex-1-yne (Table 1.2). Here again, the combination of Ig and phenol with Cp2Mo2(CO)e or Mo(CO)g gave a high yield of trimers. In several cases products formed by the interaction between the alkyne and the iodine or the 3-chlorophenol were observed. The iodine easily reacted with Cp2Mo2(CO)e to form the monomeric CpMoI(CO)3 [4], the precursor for the catalytic reaction. When this compound was used as a catalyst, no formation of the alkyne iodine adduct was observed, but the formation of polymerization and trimerization products occurred as expected. If an excess of iodine was added to the system, formation of the alkyne-iodine adduct [5] was observed and its concentration increased with increasing iodine added. The alkyne-3-chlorophenol adduct formed was isolated and identified as H H >'< R' 0 VC6H4C1 with R=C6H5 or 04119. Conclusion It follows from these results that each of the compounds Mo(CO)e, Cp2Mo(CO)6, CpMoI(CO)3 and the cocatalysts phenol, 3-chlorophenol and iodine, influenced the reactions with the alkynes in a particular way. The iodine reacted with the metal carbonyls to form a precursor for the active 54 catalytic intermediate. If the iodine was in excess, it also reacted with the alkynes to form an adduct. The 3-chlorophenol interacted with the alkynes too, as indicated by the formation of alkyne-chlorophenol adducts in some cases. These results confirms the idea of Bencheick et al. [3] that the phenol associates with the alkynes and so activates the system for the catalytic reactions to take place.
