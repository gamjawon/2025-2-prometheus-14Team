Graphical abstract Propylene polymerization titanium-magnesium catalysts (TMCs) were synthesized from different magnesium compounds with diphenylketone (DPK) as the internal donor. The catalysts differed by an order of magnitude and more in the content of titanium and donor, activity, specific surface area and pore size. Sizes of MgCl2 crystallites with 110 or 104 lateral cuts were calculated from the Ti/Mg and DPK/Mg values. For highly active TMCs the composition, XRD and specific surface area were in agreement with the MgCl2 crystallites with 104 lateral cuts, TiCl4 adsorption on one magnesium ion and elongated in the 001 direction. For low-activity TMCs obtained by reacting Mg with BuCl, the sizes of MgCl2 crystallites in different directions were close. Activity of the catalysts was inversely proportional to the crystallite size calculated from the TMC composition. This dependence was preserved for the catalysts obtained via the substitution of ketone by phthalate. Keywords Titanium-magnesium catalysts Propylene polymerization MgCl2 crystallite size Internal donor substitution 1 Introduction Supported titanium-magnesium Ziegler-Natta catalysts are virtually the only catalysts used for the production of isotactic PP in the world [1]. They consist of titanium tetrachloride and a stereoregulating electron donor compound (internal donor, ID) on the surface of MgCl2 crystallites that serve as the support [2–4]. TiCl4 and donor supposedly form complexes with magnesium ions having chlorine vacancies on the lateral cuts of MgCl2 crystallites, where magnesium ions with one or two chlorine vacancies (104 and 110 cuts, respectively) are located [4–9]. Obviously, the smaller the size of MgCl2 crystallites, the greater the fraction of magnesium ions on the lateral cuts. This leads to increasing the content of TiCl4 and ID in TMC and its activity. To this end, TMCs were synthesized in the initial step with the use of MgCl2 milling (for example, the first commercial TMC [10]). Indeed, activation of MgCl2 by milling in the absence or presence of TiCl4 and/or donor decreases the crystallinity of MgCl2 and increases titanium content and activity of the catalysts toward ethylene and propylene polymerization [2,11,12 and references therein]. However, such data are virtually absent for unmilled propylene polymerization catalysts. Recently, we studied TMCs synthesized in the presence of ketones (K) as ID, and the catalysts obtained via the substitution of ketones by dibutylphthalate (DBP) [13]. It was shown that the composition of such catalysts (molar ratio (Ti + K)/Mg for initial catalysts and (Ti+2DBP + K)/Mg for substituted ones) may correspond to the fraction of magnesium ions on the lateral cuts of MgCl2 crystallites. Presumably, this is caused by severe conditions of the catalyst synthesis, specifically, by high ratios of TiCl4 and donor to magnesium (TiCl4/Mg = 13, K/Mg = 0.3 mol), elevated temperature (110 °C), and long-term three-step holding. Such conditions can provide the formation of TiCl4 and ketone complexes with all magnesium ions on the lateral cuts and their most dense distribution over these cuts. Thus, for the series of TMCs, molar ratios Ti/K and Ti/DBP were close to 2, indicating the distribution of TiCl4 complexes and magnesium as dimers between donor complexes and magnesium. Data on the fraction of magnesium ions on the lateral cuts calculated from TMC composition can be used to estimate the MgCl2 crystallite size and to compare it with the data on TMC structure obtained by XRD and adsorption measurements. In addition, it is possible to analyze the effect exerted by the type of 110 or 104 lateral cuts of MgCl2 crystallites. According to DFT calculations [14] and references therein], the TiCl4 and donor complexes have different strengths on these cuts, in particular, strong TiCl4 complexes on the 110 cut and weak ones on the 104 cut. It seems interesting to acquire such data for the catalysts widely differing in their crystallite size and to compare the obtained data on the composition and structure with the catalytic properties. In this work, the catalysts having different sizes of MgCl2 crystallites were synthesized from different magnesium compounds by the methods without milling, when: a) MgCl2 is formed in situ upon interaction of magnesium compounds with TiCl4 or b) first MgCl2 is synthesized, and then TiCl4 and donor are introduced. Diphenylketone was used as ID to estimate quantitatively the number of magnesium ions on MgCl2 cuts assuming that ketone forms the complex only with one magnesium ion. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Materials were mainly described in [13,15]. TMCs were synthesized using six magnesium compounds: commercial adduct MgCl2∙3EtOH; magnesium ethoxide (Aldrich), magnesium ethoxychloride Mg(OEt)1.33Cl0.67 obtained by reacting 2MgPh2*MgCl2 solution in dibutyl ether (DBE) with Si(OEt)4 according to [16]; MgCl2(PhSiCl3) obtained by reacting 2MgPh2*MgCl2 solution in DBE with PhSiCl3 according to [17]; MgCl2(BuCl) obtained by reacting Mg powder with n-butylchloride (BuCl) in heptane at 80 °C according to [18]; and MgCl2(BuCl + T) obtained by heating of MgCl2(BuCl) sample under vacuum at 235 °C for 2.5 h. 2.2 Synthesis of catalysts Catalysts with diphenylketone (DPK) were obtained by the interaction of magnesium compounds with TiCl4 in the presence of chlorobenzene (TiCl4/chlorobenzene = 1:1 vol.). The three-step synthesis was performed in an argon atmosphere. In the first step, a magnesium compound (TiCl4/Mg = 13 mol) was loaded in the reactor with a TiCl4 solution at 100 °C. After that, the temperature was raised to 110 °C, DPK (DPK/Mg = 0.3 mol) was introduced, and the reaction mixture was held at 110 °C for 1 h. After stopping the stirrer and precipitating the solid product, the mother liquor was decanted. In the second step, a mixture of TiCl4 and chlorobenzene (TiCl4/chlorobenzene = 1:1 vol., TiCl4/Mg = 13 mol) was loaded in the reactor, the reaction mixture was stirred at 110 °C for 30 min, and the mother liquor was decanted after precipitation of the solid product. The third step was similar to the second one. The resulting catalysts were washed four times with heptane at a gradual cooling from 75 °C to Troom. The substituted TMCs were synthesized in a similar way as the catalysts with ketone, but in the first step the TMC (TiCl4/Mg = 13 mol) with DPK instead of magnesium compound was loaded in the reactor with the TiCl4/chlorobenzene (1:1 vol.) mixture, and then di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP, DBP/Mg = 0.05 mol) was added at 110 °C. The second, third and washing steps were carried out similar to the synthesis of TMCs with ketone. 2.3 Chemical analysis The content of Ti and Mg was measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (Optima 4300 DV, Perkin-Elmer) from the catalyst solution in a 5 % aqueous solution of H2SO4. The content of ethoxy groups (in the form of ethanol) was estimated by gas chromatography (NetChrom v2.0) from the catalyst solution in methyl cellosolve. Decyl alcohol was used as the internal standard. The content of DPK and DBP was determined by liquid chromatography (LC-20 Prominence, Shimadzu) from the catalyst solution in acetonitrile. The internal standard was represented by dimethyl phthalate. 2.4 XRD TMCs were studied by XRD on a diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å) in a range of 2Θ = 5 – 75°. The coherent scattering region (CSR) size along the 110 direction (d110) was calculated according to the Scherrer formula from the peak at 2Θ = 50°, and along the 001 direction (d001), at 2Θ = 15°. 2.5 Pore structure The analysis of the pore structure was performed using low-temperature nitrogen adsorption (ASAP 2400 Micrоmeritics Instrument). Specific surface area (SBET, m2/g) and total pore volume (Vpore, cm3/g) were found, and average pore size (dpore, nm) was calculated by the equation dpore = 4 Vpore/SBET. Pore size distribution was calculated from the adsorption branch of the adsorption isotherm using the BJH method. 2.6 Propylene polymerization Propylene polymerization was carried out in an autoclave in heptane (300 ml) at 70 °C and a total pressure of 7 bar for 1 h in the presence of hydrogen (1 vol.% in the gas phase). Triethylaluminum (4 mmol AlEt3/L) served as a cocatalyst, and cyclohexyl methyl dimethoxysilane (Al/Si = 20 mol) was used as the external donor. A weight of the catalyst sample was ca. 10 mg. Prepolymerization was performed at 30 °C and a propylene pressure of 1 bar for 2 min. The content of atactic PP (APP) was found as the PP fraction soluble in polymerization heptane. 2.7 XS measurements The content of the xylene-soluble PP fraction with a low stereoregularity (the XS values) was estimated according to ASTM D5492. 3 Results and discussion Titanium-magnesium catalysts (TMCs) were synthesized from different magnesium compounds in the presence of diphenylketone as the internal donor. The substitution of ketone in the obtained TMCs by dibutyl phthalate as the stereoregulating donor was used to synthesize the substituted catalysts. The relations between composition, structure and catalytic properties were investigated for the TMCs synthesized with ketone and the substituted TMCs with dibutyl phthalate. 3.1 Catalysts prepared in the presence of diphenylketone 3.1.1 Composition and catalytic properties The composition and catalytic properties of TMC-1 – TMC-6 catalysts synthesized using different magnesium compounds in the presence of diphenylketone as the internal donor are reported in Table 1 . For the first three catalysts, the MgCl2 support in TMC is formed in situ during the synthesis upon interaction of magnesium compound with TiCl4 (TMC-1 – TMC-3). Other catalysts were obtained with MgCl2 synthesized by different methods (TMC-4 – TMC-6). The catalysts essentially differ in their composition. In the series from TMC-1 to TMC-6, a pronounced decrease in the content of titanium (4.8–0.5 %) and ketone (9.8–0.6 %) is observed. Catalysts in which MgCl2 is formed during the synthesis have a high content of titanium (3.8–4.8 %) and DPK (8.2–9.8 %). Catalysts synthesized using different MgCl2 samples have a much lower content of titanium (0.5–1.8 %) and donor (0.6–4.1 %). The (Ti + DPK)/Mg ratio in the indicated series of catalysts decreases from 0.251 to 0.015. Therefore, the fraction of magnesium atoms on the lateral cuts of MgCl2, where complexes with TiCl4 and donor are formed, decreases in this series. This can be interpreted as an increase in the size of magnesium chloride crystallites. Assuming that titanium and magnesium are present in the composition of TMCs as chlorides, the total content of catalyst components is 86.5–95.6 %, i.e. quite close to 100 %. The initial (A0) and average (A) activities in the series of catalysts from TMC-1 to TMC-6 decrease considerably: from 23 to 1 and from 11.6 to 0.3 kg PP/g cat h Note that activity in this series of catalysts changes in a similar way as composition. PP isotacticity is within a narrow range of 85–88 %. The content of atactic PP is mostly 9–12 % (7.8 and 13.7 % are observed too). 3.1.2 Investigation of catalysts structure TMCs with ketones were examined by XRD and low-temperature nitrogen adsorption (Table 2 , Fig. 1 ). According to XRD data, the size of the coherent scattering region (CSR) along the 110 direction (d110) for TMC-1 – TMC-6 changes from 5.2 to 17.1 nm. Note that along the 001 direction (perpendicular to the Cl-Mg-Cl layer) the CSR sizes d001 are smaller than d110 sizes along the layer. Presumably, upon formation of MgCl2 crystallites, lattice defects associated with mutual shifts of Cl-Mg-Cl layers are formed more readily than along the layer. The specific surface area (SBET) of the catalysts decreases by an order of magnitude (from 295 to 29 m2/g) in the series from TMC-1 to TMC-6 (Table 2). In this series of catalysts, a significant increase in the pore size (from 2.5 to 28 nm) is observed at weak changes in the pore volume (0.18 – 0.24 cm3/g) (Table 2). 3.1.3 Structure versus composition of the catalysts According to the data on the composition of TMC, it is possible to estimate the fraction of magnesium ions on the lateral cuts of MgCl2 and the size of its crystallites. Let us consider a model of MgCl2 crystallite in the form of a hexagonal prism of Cl-Mg-Cl layers with side a and height h (Fig. 2 a). In the case of 104 lateral cuts, the plane size of the hexagonal MgCl2 crystallite along the 110 direction (perpendicular to the 104 cut) will be dc 104 = a * 30.5 = 1.73a (a is the length of the 104 lateral cut in nm) (Fig. 2b). This size should correspond to the d110 size (the size of the CSR by XRD). The fraction of magnesium ions on the 104 lateral cuts (Mglat 104) can be calculated as Mglat 104 = 1.26 (dc 104)−1; accordingly, dc 104 = 1.26 (Mglat 104)−1 (see Supporting Information). In the case of the 110 lateral cuts, the plane size of the hexagonal MgCl2 crystallite along the 110 direction will vary from a to 2a, where a is the length of the 110 lateral cut in nm (Fig. 2c). Therefore, the average size of the planes along this direction dc 110 will be equal to 1.5а (the superscript 110 in dc 110 indicates the crystallite with 110 lateral cuts). The fraction of magnesium ions on the 110 lateral cuts (Mglat 110) can be calculated as Mglat 110 = 0.62 (dc 110)−1; accordingly, dc 110 = 0.62 (Mglat 110)−1 (see Supporting Information). Data on the content of TiCl4 and donor in TMC can be used to estimate the fraction of magnesium ions on the lateral cuts of MgCl2 and the size of its crystallites. It is reasonable to assume that complexes with TiCl4 and a donor occupy all chlorine vacancies on the lateral cuts due to severe conditions of the TMCs synthesis. According to calculations by the DFT method [14 and references therein], strong TiCl4 complexes are formed upon adsorption on two chlorine vacancies: on the 110 lateral cut – between neighboring Mg ions, and on the 104 lateral cut – between two or three neighboring Mg ions in the case of monomeric or dimeric TiCl4 complexes, respectively. The TiCl4 complex with one 5-coordinated Mg ion on the 104 cut is less strong. Complexes of stereoregulating donors (usually diesters or diethers) are also formed upon adsorption on two chlorine vacancies [4,14 and references therein]. Unlike these donors, ketone (K) with one oxygen atom will occupy one chlorine vacancy. Then, in the case of the 110 lateral cuts, where each magnesium ion has two chlorine vacancies, the molar ratio (Ti+0.5K)/Mg will correspond to the fraction of Mg ions on the lateral cuts. The size of hexagonal MgCl2 crystallites with the 110 lateral cuts will be dc 110 = 0.62 ((Ti+0.5K)/Mg)−1. In the case of the 104 lateral cuts, where each magnesium ion has one chlorine vacancy, the fraction of Mg ions on the lateral cuts will correspond to the molar ratio (2Ti + K)/Mg or (1.5Ti + K)/Mg, depending on the distribution of monomeric (Ti/K ≤ 1) or dimeric and more (Ti/K ≥ 2) complexes of TiCl4, respectively. For Ti/K values between 1 and 2, the fraction of Mg ions on the lateral cuts can be calculated taking into account the contribution of the molar ratios for monomeric and dimeric TiCl4 complexes. Then the size of hexagonal MgCl2 crystallites with the 104 lateral cuts will be equal to dc 104 = 1.26 [((1.5–2)Ti + K)/Mg]−1. In the case of a less strong TiCl4 complex on one chlorine vacancy of the Mg ion on the 104 cut, the crystallite size will be dc 104* = 1.26 [(Ti + K)/Mg]−1. Table 2 shows the dc 110, dc 104, and dc 104* dimensions calculated from the catalyst composition for the hexagonal MgCl2 crystallite model. It can be seen that for highly active catalysts TMC-1 – TMC-3, the dc 110 values (MgCl2 crystallites with 110 lateral cuts) are significantly lower and do not agree with the d110 values (3–4.2 vs. 5.2–6.4 nm). The dc 104 values (MgCl2 crystallites with 104 lateral cuts) are also lower than the d110 values (3.6–4.9 vs. 5.2–6.4 nm), but to a lesser extent. At the same time, the dc 104* values (4.9–6.8 nm) are approximately in agreement with the d110 values. Thus, the obtained data on the composition of the catalysts correspond to MgCl2 crystallites with 104 lateral cuts and the densest TiCl4 adsorption (one TiCl4 on one chlorine vacancy of the Mg ion). For less active catalysts TMC-4 – TMC-6, the crystallite sizes calculated from the composition (dc 104* values) are higher than the corresponding d110 values. This indicates that the MgCl2 crystallites in these catalysts have lattice defects, which determine the smaller CSR sizes. The values of d110 (by X-ray) and dc 104* (based on TMC composition) for catalysts TMC-1 – TMC-6 are compared in Fig. 3 . Note that the presence of TiCl4 complexes on the 104 cut (in contrast to DFT calculations) can be explained by the conditions for the synthesis of TMCs. At high concentrations of TiCl4, the most complete and dense filling of chlorine vacancies in MgCl2 occurs. Because of the high density, the neighboring donor or TiCl4 molecules stabilize the TiCl4 complex with one Mg ion on the 104 cut. In DFT calculations, the mutual influence of the neighboring donor or TiCl4 complexes is usually not taken into account. However, recent DFT calculations have shown that a neighboring donor increases the strength of the TiCl4 complex on the 104 lateral cut [19]. The sizes of microparticles (MgCl2 crystallites) in the form of a hexagonal prism with side a and height h can be calculated from the specific surface area (SBET). For the diameter of such a microparticle dm, the size dm = 1.73a was taken, as in the estimation of dc 104 from the TMC composition. The evaluation was carried out for microparticles with different h/dm ratios from 1 to 6, i.e. from the particles close to cubic to the particles in the form of rods (see Supporting Information). It can be seen (Table 2) that such a change in the shape of a microparticle at the same SBET leads to a decrease in dm. For the TMC-1 – TMC-4 catalysts obtained mainly with the participation of ethoxy groups, the dc 104* sizes calculated from the composition are noticeably lower than the corresponding dm sizes calculated from SBET, in the case of h/dm = 1 (4.9–17 vs. 8.8–24 nm), but close in the case of h/dm = 6 (6.4–17 nm) (Table 2, Fig. 3). For the TMC-5 and TMC-6 catalysts obtained by the interaction of Mg with BuCl, the dc 104* sizes are close to dm in the case of h/dm = 1 (28 and 83 vs. 27 and 90 nm), thus testifying cubic microparticles, in contrast to rods for other TMC. Overall, the catalyst consists of microparticles represented by MgCl2 crystallites, the lattice defects of which determine the CSR sizes along and perpendicular to the Cl-Mg-Cl layers. In the case of highly active catalysts, the MgCl2 crystallites have an elongated shape in the 001 direction, and sizes dc 104*, d110 and dm (as the diameter of an elongated microparticle) are relatively close. Note, the rod type substructure of macroparticles was observed for some TMCs – Spheripol type [20] and Lynx type [21]. In the latter case, Chang et al. [21] showed by a combination of SEM, TEM, XRD and X-EDS that (i) the primary catalyst particle consists of the long crystal rods of MgCl2 and (ii) the planes of the Cl – Mg – Cl layers are oriented mostly perpendicularly to the lengths of the rods. For low-activity TMC, the sizes of microparticles in different directions are approximately the same, and the CSR values are noticeably lower. 3.1.4 Activity versus structure of the catalysts Fig. 4 displays the dependence of initial and average activities of TMC-1 – TMC-6 catalysts on their dispersion as the inverse value of dc size calculated from (Ti + DPK)/Mg. It is seen that activity of the catalysts widely varies in inverse proportion to the dc size of MgCl2 crystallites. Thus, for the studied catalysts, a direct dependence exists between the size of MgCl2 crystallites and the properties (composition and catalytic activity) of TMCs with diphenylketone. 3.2 Catalysts obtained via the substitution of ketone by phthalate Our earlier work [13] demonstrated that the substitution of ketone by phthalate is accompanied by redistribution of titanium chloride and donors on the lateral cuts of MgCl2 crystallite because phthalate occupies two magnesium ions on the lateral cuts of MgCl2 crystallite instead of one magnesium ion in the case of ketone. It seems interesting to investigate such a substitution process for TMC-1 – TMC-6 catalysts having different sizes of MgCl2 crystallites. Table 3 shows the composition and properties of TMC-1s – TMC-6s catalysts synthesized via the substitution of DPK in TMC-1 – TMC-6 catalysts by DBP (DBP/Mg = 0.05 mol). The substituted catalysts contain phthalate, while the content of ketone sharply decreases (by a factor of 5–10). In the series from TMC-1s to TMC-6s, strong differences are observed in the composition, particularly, in the content of titanium (from 3.6 to 0.4 %) and phthalate (from 9.1 to 0.4 %). Substituted TMCs as compared to the initial catalysts with DPK (Table 1) have lower ratios Ti/Mg (0.11 – 0.009 vs. 0.16 – 0.011) and donor/Mg (0.064 – 0.0016 vs. 0.09 – 0.0036). This occurs because DBP is a bidentate ligand and occupies two magnesium ions on the lateral cut of MgCl2 crystallite instead of one magnesium ion in the case of ketone. As a result, a smaller amount of TiCl4 and phthalate can form complexes with the same number of magnesium ions on the lateral cut of MgCl2 crystallite. Thus, it is reasonable to use (Ti + 2DBP + DPK)/Mg when estimating the fraction of magnesium ions on the lateral cut of MgCl2 crystallite and the crystallite size from the data on composition of substituted TMCs (Table 3). We assume that the substituted TMCs have the same MgCl2 crystallites with 104 lateral cuts as the corresponding initial TMCs (Table 1) used for donor substitution [13,15]. In the series of substituted catalysts from TMC-1s to TMC-6s, the ratio (Ti + 2DBP + DPK)/Mg decreases from 0.226 to 0.0127. The crystallite size dc calculated from this molar ratio increases from 5.6 to 99 nm. It is close to changes in the crystallite size dc 104* (from 5.0 to 84 nm) calculated for the initial TMCs with ketone (Table 2). Thus, upon substitution of DPK by DBP, the dependence of TMC composition on the size of magnesium chloride crystallites corresponds to that for the initial catalysts (Tables 1 and 2). The distribution of TiCl4 and donors on the lateral cuts (Ti/ID) in substituted catalysts TMC-1s – TMC-4s is quite close to that in the initial catalysts, particularly, Ti/ID = 1.7–2.1 vs. 1.7 – 1.9. This may correspond to the distribution of TiCl4 complexes with magnesium mostly as dimers between complexes of donor with magnesium. A high Ti/ID of 4.8 in the case of TMC-6s may be related to the underestimated phthalate amount determined in the catalyst with a very low donor content. The substituted catalysts have a higher stereospecificity as compared to the initial TMCs. PP isotacticity is mostly 94–96 % against 85–88 %. The APP fraction sharply decreases (0.75–1.4 against 9–12 %). TMC-5s shows a lower stereospecificity. In the series of substituted catalysts, activity changes from ∼13 to 0.3 kg PP/g cat h Fig. 5 displays the dependence of activity of the substituted catalysts on their dispersion (1/dc) calculated from the catalyst composition (from (Ti + 2DBP + DPK)/Mg). It is seen that the catalyst activity is virtually proportional to its dispersion and consistent with a similar dependence for the initial catalysts (Fig. 4). 4 Conclusion (i) The synthesis of TMCs was carried out using different magnesium compounds in the presence of diphenylketone. TMCs differed significantly in the titanium and donor content, activity, specific surface area and pore size. According to the data on the TMC composition (using the Ti/Mg and DPK/Mg values as the fraction of magnesium ions on the lateral cuts), the sizes of MgCl2 hexagonal crystallites along the Cl-Mg-Cl layer (along the 110 direction) were calculated for the lateral cuts 110 or 104. (ii) For highly active TMCs, the composition and XRD data corresponded to MgCl2 crystallites with 104 lateral cuts and TiCl4 adsorption on one magnesium ion. The specific surface area data were used to calculate the sizes of microparticles (MgCl2 crystallites) in the form of hexagonal prisms with different ratios of height to diameter dm (from near cubic to rod-shaped microparticles). For the active catalysts prepared mainly with the participation of ethoxy groups, the crystallite sizes calculated from the composition agree with the sizes dm calculated from SBET in the case of rod-shaped microparticles, i.e. MgCl2 crystallites elongated in the 001 direction. For the catalysts obtained by the interaction of Mg with BuCl, the sizes of MgCl2 crystallites calculated from the composition agree with the sizes dm in the case of near cubic microparticles. (iii) Upon substitution of ketone by phthalate, the substituted catalysts have a higher activity and stereospecificity as compared to the initial TMCs. The dependence of TMC composition on the size of MgCl2 crystallites corresponds to that for the initial catalysts. (iv) Activity of the catalysts is inversely proportional to the size of MgCl2 crystallite. This dependence is retained also for the catalysts synthesized with the substitution of ketone by phthalate. (v) For the series of initial and substituted catalysts, the molar ratio Ti/donor is 1.7 – 2. This may correspond to the distribution of TiCl4 complexes on the lateral cuts of MgCl2 mostly as dimers between donor complexes. CRediT authorship contribution statement D.K.

        "dc:description": "Propylene polymerization titanium-magnesium catalysts (TMCs) were synthesized from different magnesium compounds with diphenylketone (DPK) as the internal donor. The catalysts differed by an order of magnitude and more in the content of titanium and donor, activity, specific surface area and pore size. Sizes of MgCl2 crystallites with 110 or 104 lateral cuts were calculated from the Ti/Mg and DPK/Mg values. For highly active TMCs the composition, XRD and specific surface area were in agreement with the MgCl2 crystallites with 104 lateral cuts, TiCl4 adsorption on one magnesium ion and elongated in the 001 direction. For low-activity TMCs obtained by reacting Mg with BuCl, the sizes of MgCl2 crystallites in different directions were close. Activity of the catalysts was inversely proportional to the crystallite size calculated from the TMC composition. This dependence was preserved for the catalysts obtained via the substitution of ketone by phthalate.",
