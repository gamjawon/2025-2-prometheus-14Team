JOTHIMONY, S. VANCHEESAN* and J. C. KURIACOSE Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras 600 036 (India) (Received June 13,1984; accepted March 7,1986) Summary Transfer hydrogenation of ketones to alcohols using iron carbonyls as catalysts in liquid-liquid phase occurs in the presence of phase transfer cata- lysts (PTC). Based on the percentage yield of the products, the efficiencies of the phase transfer agent, iron carbonyls and the donors are compared. Benzyltriethylammonium chloride and 18-crown-6 are equally effective and better than tricaprylmethylammonium chloride (Aliquat 336). Among the three iron carbonyls the order of efficiency is Fe3(CO)i2 > Fe2(CO)9 > Fe(CO)5. 1-Phenylethanol is a better donor than isopropanol. The relative ease of reducibility of various ketones increases with increasing reduction potential. The stereochemistry of reduction of 4-t-butylcyclohexanone is discussed. Introduction We have reported [1-4] the transfer hydrogenation of ketones and aldehydes using isopropanol, 1-phenylethanol and a few natural products as donors and using RuC4(PPh3)3 as catalyst. Transfer hydrogenation by polymer-anchored Ru, Rh and Ir complexes has been reported recently [5]. However transfer hydrogenation under phase transfer conditions has not been described thus far. We report here the first examples of such a reaction using benzyltriethylammonium chloride, tricaprylmethylammonium chloride and 18-crown-6 as phase transfer agents. Isopropanol and 1-phenylethanol act as donors and several ketones are used as acceptors (Table 1). Fe(CO)5, Fe2(CO)9 and Fe3(CO)i2 are compared for their efficiency as catalysts for reduction of various ketones. The reaction mixture consists of the following: 25 mg of PTC, 10 ml 1 N NaOH | [ (aq) 0.5mMofFe (CO)y ^11 (org) D:A (1:1) and benzene 15 ml D = Donor; A = Acceptor *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 12 TABLE 1 Transfer hydrogenation of various ketones to alcohols Sl.

The reaction mixture was stirred under nitrogen for 2.5 h at a tempera- ture varying between 25 and 45 C. At the end of the reaction the organic phase in which the products are found is distilled under vacuum and analysed by GLC, IR and ^ NMR spectroscopy. Results show the formation of ace- tone and acetophenone respectively when isopropanol and 1-phenylethanol were used as donors. The acceptor is converted to the corresponding alcohol. Reaction of iron carbonyls with OH\" results in the formation of the corresponding carbonylate anions, [HFea;(CO)y-1 ]~ (x = 1,2, 3; y = 5,9,12) [6]. The hydridocar bony late anions are potential reducing agents and are employed extensively in organic synthesis for the reduction of nitroarenes [7], Schiff bases [8], conjugated dienes to monoenes [9] and alkylation and arylation of amines with aldehydes [10]. Selective hydrogenation of a,^- unsaturated ketones is also reported [11, 12] using the anions. In these cases HFea.(CO)y-i and the substrate must be taken in equimolar quantities. By employing phase transfer catalysts [12,14] such as benzyltriethylammonium chloride, Aliquat 336 or 18-crown-6, the reduction occurs under mild con- ditions and the yield of the product is good. In the reduction of cyclohexa- none using isopropanol as the donor and Fe3(CO)i2 as the catalyst, the per- centage yields of cyclohexanol obtained are 60 and 20 when the reactions were carried out under conditions with and without the phase transfer agent respectively. Part of this work has been reported earlier [15]. Results and discussion Our studies indicate the following: (1) the efficiency of the metal catalysts decreases in the following order under our experimental conditions (Table 2): Fe3(CO)u > Fe2(CO)9 > Fe(CO)5; (2) among the phase transfer agents the catalytic efficiency is found to be BTEAC = 18-crown-6 > Aliquat 336; 13 TABLE 2 Transfer hydrogenation of cyclohexanone to cyclohexanol No. Substrate Donor Catalyst PTC Product (%) 1 cyclohexanone isopropanol Fe2(CO)9 A cyclohexanol (42) cyclohexanone isopropanol Fe2(CO)9 B cyclohexanol (30) cyclohexanone isopropanol Fei(CO)9 C cyclohexanol (44) 2 cyclohexanone 1-phenylethanol Fe3(CO)i2 A cyclohexanol (78) cyclohexanone 1-phenylethanol Fe2(CO)9 A cyclohexanol (64) cyclohexanone 1-phenylethanol Fe(CO)5 A no reaction 3 cyclohexanone 1-phenylethanol Fe3(CO)n A cyclohexanol (78) cyclohexanone isopropanol Fea(CO)n A cyclohexanol (60) \"PTC = (A) BzEtaNCI-; (B) Aliquat 336; (C) 18-crown-6; time = 2.6 h; T = 28 C; [cat]/ [sub]= 1:25. (3) 1-phenylethanol is a better donor than isopropanol; (4) the relative ease of reducibility of various ketones increases with increasing reduction potential. Thus 2-butanone (reduction potential ^100 mV) gives minimum yield of product, and cyclohexanone (reduction poten- tial 162 mV) gives maximum yield. In Table 1 the acceptors are given in the order of decreasing reduction potential. At temperatures up to 50 C there is a steady increase in the yield of products and above 50 C a steep decline. There is an induction period of 10 - 20 min, which is the time required for the formation of HFe^(CO)^-i, the key intermediate and the actual catalyst for the reduction. Analysis of the reactants during the induction period indicates negligible conversion to products. At temperatures above 50 C the anion either decomposes or is converted to Fe3(CO)i2. Reduction of nitro, keto and aldehyde compounds using Fe^(CO)y have been reported [7, 12, 13] with and without phase transfer agents. For the reduction of nitrobenzene in the presence of PTC using Fe3(CO)i2, Alper has suggested [13] the removal of the oxygen from NO; as COz. In this case the deoxygenation is not a catalytic process with respect to HFe3(CO)7i, since two CO groups are lost for every molecule of aniline formed. In the present procedure the ratio of iron carbonyls to the substrate is in the range 1:25 to 1:50. At the end of the reaction HFe3(CO)n is regener- ated, as shown by a peak with \\max at 540 mp. as against \\max 602 mp. for Fe3(CO)i2 and v(CO) values at 2070(vw), 1995(s), 1978(m) and 1950(w) cm\"1 typical of the anion. By an independent experiment using Me4N+HFe3(CO)Tl as catalyst we have carried out homogeneous transfer hydrogenation in benzene without any phase transfer agent. As expected, there was no induction period since HFe3(CO)u is already present; after completion of the reaction the catalyst is regenerated, as evidenced by the same intensity of the absorption peak of the catalyst before and after the reaction. 14 The present procedure has the following advantages: (i) the ratio [Fex(CO)y]/[substrate] is very low; (ii) HFe3(CO)Yi is regenerated; (iii) a variety of donors can be conveniently used to effect selective reduction; and (iv) in a reverse sense this method can be employed for selective dehy- drogenation of organic compounds using them as donors. The following observations give a clue to the probable mechanism: (1) the formation of ketone from the corresponding secondary alcohol (donor); (2) the transfer of hydrogen from the anion, HFe3(CO)u to the coor- dinated acceptor is evident from the formation of deuterated product, R^HODR4, when NaOD is used in the aqueous phase. This gives DFe3(CO)n, from which H (or D) is then transferred to the ketone (acceptor) in the first step. The product is a mixture of R^HODR4 and R^HOHR4. In the IR spectrum the v(OD) frequency appears at a value lower than that of OH (Ay = 600 cm\"1). In the absence of the donor, R'CHOHR2, at optimum conditions (45 C and maximum stirring) even Fe3(CO)i2 gives less than 10% yield and Fe(CO)5 gives none. This suggests that in the former case there is a definite contribution from OH\" to the product formed but HFe3(CO)Yi is not regenerated. When H^O was used in the place of NaOH or KOH in the presence of a donor, no product was formed. This suggests that OH~ is essen- tial for the initial formation of HFe3(CO)\"n. Further studies on the mecha- nism are in progress. Stereochemistry The reduction of cyclohexanones by complex hydrides proceeds by either of the two routes, namely (i) product development-controlled or (ii) steric approach-controlled. The predominant isomer would be formed by approach of the entering group from the least hindered side of the carbonyl complex. With an unhindered ketone the predominant product is the equa- torial (trans) isomer [16]. In the absence of steric restriction, the predomi- nant product will be the thermodynamically more stable isomer of a series. It was considered interesting to study the influence of the reducing agents, namely HFe3(CO)Yi, HFe^CO)^ and HFe(CO)4 (which are formed in situ), on the isomer ratio of the products. For this study we have chosen 1-phenylethanol as donor and benzyltriethylammonium chloride as the phase transfer agent. In 4-t-butylcyclohexanone, the t-butyl group exerts no steric influence on the reagent approaching the keto group. In the reduction of 4-methyl- and 4-t-butylcyclohexanones [17, 18] using lithium aluminium hydride, sodium borohydride, aluminium isoprop- oxide, etc. the ratio of cis to trans isomers changes with the size of the reducing agents [16]. For LiAlH4, since there is no steric influence, product development control is more important than steric approach control. Hence the more stable isomer ^roras-4-t-butylcyclohexanol is formed in larger quan- 16 tity than the cis alcohol (Irons to cis ratio is 80:20 and equilibrium ratio is 88:12). With NaBH4 as reducing agent, the amount of trans product is slightly reduced (trans to cis ratio is 75:25). With more bulky reducing agents the yield of trans product is further reduced. With HFe3(CO)n as reducing agent the ratio of trans to cis alcohol is 62:38. With HFe2(CO)g and HFe(CO)4 there is an increase in the trans-isomer and the product ratios are 68:32 and 75:25 respectively, in agreement with the results reported for the reduction of 4-methylcyclohexanone using L1A1H4 and NaBH4. The reduction involves the initial formation of a metallo-organic com- plex between the ketone and the hydride species [16,17]. It is in this com- plex that hydride transfer occurs and sp2 bonding of the carbonyl group changes to sp3 bonding of the product. In the process, the intermediate stages of the reduction are governed by the steric requirements of the prod- ucts. The relative stabilities of the products also become important in this early stage of the reduction. For the initial formation of the metal-substrate complex, steric approach control favours equatorial attack by the HFe^- (CO)y-i reagent. As the nuclearity of the hydrido iron complex changes from 3 to 1 (tri-iron to mono-iron) the yield of trans product increases. For HFe(CO)4 the probability of axial attack becomes nearly equal to that of equatorial attack, and the yield of the resulting products is governed by their stabilities. As a result, with HFe(CO)4 the more stable frans-4-t-butylcyclo- hexanol is formed in larger quantity. The products were separated on a column of alumina in which the cis- alcohol is eluted first using pentane as eluent and the trans-alcohol is eluted using 20% ether in pentane. The ^ NMR spectrum exhibits quintets for Ci H at 6 3.9 and 4.5 for cis and trans alcohols respectively. For Ci OH a broad signal is obtained at 5 1.8 and 3.4 for cis and trans alcohols respectively. For Cz H and C^ H a triplet at S 1.4 and multiplet at 5 1.6 - 2.0 were obtained for cis and trans isomers respectively.
