In this review the main catalytic, kinetic and mechanistic features of these catalysts are discussed with reference to the role of vanadium as the key component. Specific topics discussed include: (i) nature of the phases present in V-Sb-oxide catalysts, their modification during the catalytic reaction and nature of the non-stoichiometry of vanadium antimonate, (ii) catalytic and kinetic behavior as well as some specific aspects which characterize their reactivity, (iii) structure-activity and selectivity relationships, and (iv) reaction mechanism, influence on the surface reactivity of chemisorbed species (ammonia, in particular) and presence of competitive pathways of transformation.

Introduction Acrylonitrile is a widely used chemical with a production of over five million tons per year principally by catalytic heterogeneous gas phase ammoxidation of propene. The cost of the hydrocarbon feedstock has a significant effect on the overall production cost and this fact drives the search for alternative processes using less costly raw materials [1]. The use of propane in place of propene is the natural choice for an alternative process [2-4], due to the significant price difference between the two hydrocarbons: CH3-CH2-CH3 + NH3 + 202 ~ CH2=CH-CN + 4H20 (AH = - 151 kcal/mol) * Corresponding author.

Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 Although use of the alkane lowers the productivity and requires more severe reaction conditions, economic estimates based on actual data [5] indicate that the process of direct propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile is economically worth- while. Further improvement of the selectivity and activity of the catalyst, however, would increase interest in the process. The synthesis of acrylonitrile from propane requires a modification of the catalysts used for propene ammoxidation, because the latter catalysts are not active enough with the alkane feed. A survey of the patent literature [1-3] indicates that two main classes of catalysts have been proposed to be active and selective in propane ammoxidation without the need for gas phase additives as in earlier patents [3] and references therein: (i) vanadium antimonate with a rutile structure [6-10] and (ii) Bi-molybdate with a sheelite structure [2] and references therein, [11-14]. The common feature of these two classes of catalysts is the presence of (i) vanadium as the key component for the activity in propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene [15] and (ii) a mixed oxide matrix known to be selective in propene ammoxidation to acrylonitrile [16,17]. However, the catalytic behavior of these two classes of catalysts cannot be simply described as that deriving from the sum of a catalytic function for the first step of propane to propene transformation and a second catalytic function for transformation of the propene intermediate to acrylonitrile. For example, the second step usually occurs at much lower temperatures than the first step, due to the easier activation of the alkene molecule in comparison with alkane. Nevertheless, propene forms in significantly high amounts during propane ammoxidation [3] and its complete conversion to acrylonitrile is difficult to obtain. The apparent critical step is thus transformation of the propene intermediate to acrylonitrile, differently from that expected on the basis of the reactivity of the single hydrocarbons (propane and propene). A more detailed analysis of the structure-activity and selectivity relationships and in particular of the role of vanadium is thus required to understand the factors controlling the reactivity and the key features of the catalyst which make it possible to improve their behavior in propane ammoxidation. The scope of this review is to analyze the problem, provide an overview of the main kinetic and mechanistic aspects of the reaction of propane ammoxidation and discuss the nature of the active phase and active centers. The discussion is limited to undoped V-Sb-oxide catalysts for two main reasons: (i) patent data indicate V- Sb-oxide as the active components, whereas other elements present in patented compositions (Mo, W, Te, Ti, Fe, for example) play mainly a role of co-catalysts to enhance the rate of transformation of intermediate propene; furthermore, espe- cially in conditions of complete conversion of oxygen and excess propane undoped V-Sb-oxide are preferable [3] and (ii) undoped V-Sb-oxide have been investigated in more detail in the literature than other mixed oxides or multicomponent systems active in propane ammoxidation. Ga-antimonate based mixed oxides have also been reported to have an interesting selective behavior in the ammoxidation of G. Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 145 propane, but their key structural and mechanistic aspects have been reviewed recently [4]. 2. Nature of phases present in V-Sb-oxide catalysts 2.1. Samples after calcination The phase composition of V-Sb-oxide catalysts depends on four main factors: (i) method of preparation, (ii) temperature, (iii) gas phase composition during the thermal treatment, and (iv) Sb:V atomic ratio [18,19]. Various methods of preparation have been cited in the literature [19] which can be classified into two broad classes: (a) solid state reaction between the two oxides (usually V205 and Sb203) and (b) solid state reaction between vanadium and antimony in a mixed hydroxide, where V and Sb may be present in different oxidation states depending on the preparation method. Solid state reaction between vanadium and antimony occurs in the 350-500 range [19] and usually involves a two electron redox reaction between V5+ and Sb3+ to form the VSbO4 rutile phase. In the rutile phase, antimony is present as Sb5+ as shown by 121Sb-M6ssbauer analysis in calcined samples with an Sb : V ratio of 1 [20], whereas, based on the charge balance, vanadium is formally present as V3+. However, due to (i) the easy non-stoichiometry of the rutile phase [ 16,18- 24] and (ii) the possible intergrowth of the isostructural vn+-oxide, the VSbO4 may be better described as a (V3+-V4+)Sbl-gO4 mixed-valence compound [ 18]. When the Sb : V ratio is higher than 1.0 (stoichiometric value to form VSbO4), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows that the excess of antimony is present as o~-Sb204 or/%Sb204, the latter for calcination temperatures higher than about 800 [ 19]. In fact, the t~---~fl-Sb204 transition is shifted to temperatures about 150 lower than in pure Sb-oxide due to a catalytic effect of V on the phase transition, possibly due to partial incorporation of V into the/3-5b204 lattice [23,25,26]. Other minor phases such as VaOs, Sb6013 and Sb203 are sometimes detected by XRD analysis, depending on the preparation conditions [19], but usually these side bands are absent for calcination temperatures above about 600 and proper preparation. According to XRD characterization, V-Sb-oxide catalysts may thus be described as monophasic (VSbO4) or biphasic (VSbO4+Sb204) systems, depending on the Sb : V ratio. Infrared spectroscopy (IR) reveals, however, that additional phases not detected by XRD are present in V-Sb-oxide catalysts. Due to the influence of the preparation on the characteristics of V-Sb-oxide [19], discussion is restricted here for the sake of clarity to a single series of samples with variable Sb : V ratio, but prepared by the same method [24]. However, the features discussed are valid in general for V-Sb-oxides, although the relative amounts of the various phases may change depending on the specific method of preparation [19]. 146 G. Centi et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 For a Sb : V ratio below 1.0, clearly evident bands of VS+-oxide are detected at 1020 and 840 cm-1 (Vv=o and 6vov, respectively), together with bands due to VSbO modes of the antimonate group in the rutile structure (675 and 545 cm-I [27]) [ 18,19,24]. The XRD pattern of the same sample shows the presence only of rutile. At the higher Sb : V ratios, XRD indicates the formation of weak reflections of o~- Sb204 only for Sb : V>2, whereas IR spectroscopy [19,24] already indicates the presence of this phase in the sample with Sb:V=I.0 (a shoulder at about 740 cm-1). Bands due to VS+-oxide are still evident in the sample with Sb : V----3.0, showing that the reaction of antimony with vanadium to form vanadium antimonate is not complete even for a large excess of antimony. An evident shoulder at 890 cm-1 is also noted in the samples [19,24], which may be assigned to SbS+-oxide supported over VSbO4 crystallites. This shoulder increases in relative intensity as the Sb : V ratio increases. In summary, data indicate that calcined V-Sb-oxide catalysts may not be considered as only monophasic VSbO4 or biphasic VSbO4wSb204 systems, but instead an overlayer of well dispersed V5+- and SbS+-oxides covers the crystalline phases. With increasing Sb : V ratio, there is a change in the relative amounts of these overlying, XRD amorphous phases, in addition to the change from a monophasic to biphasic system. Disappearance of VS+-oxide is not complete, even for samples with a large excess of antimony. The amorphous phases of V5+- and SbS+-oxide dispersed over ruffle vanadium antimonate phase, however, are key components determining the catalytic beha- vior in propane ammoxidation as discussed later. As a matter of fact, their gently removal from the catalyst, for example by selective extraction in diluted aqueous ammonia solution for VS+-oxide or HCI solution for SbS+-oxide, causes a significant drop of catalytic performances in propane ammoxidation. Furthermore, their presence is caused from the structural non-stoichiometric characteristics itself of vanadium antimonate. These surface phases thus cannot be considered side phases derived from uncompleted reaction of starting precursor oxides, but are instead peculiar components of V-Sb-oxide system. At the higher Sb : V ratios, in addition to a change in the phase composition, a change in the structural characteristics of the vanadium antimonate rutile phase was also observed. Reported in Fig. 1 is the change in the cell parameters of the tetragonal rutile cell in V-Sb-oxide catalysts with increasing Sb : V ratio [24]. In iron antimonate, catalyst active for propylene ammoxidation and isostructural with V-Sb-oxide [ 16], an expansion of the rutile cell volume has been observed with increasing Sb : Fe ratio above 1.0 [16,28]. The effect was interpreted as due to the formation of a non-stoichiometric rutile phase by excess antimony. Berry et al. [29,30] instead have shown by electron diffraction studies the presence of cation ordering in iron antimonate with the formation of a trirutile-like superstructure. Estimated diffraction maxima in the trirutile structure were analogous to those of the monorutile structure with the absence of detectable superlattice reflections [30]. Therefore, even in diffractograms obtained by neutron diffraction on iron G.

Sb-V-oxide samples prepared by a precipitation- deposition method [24]. antimonate [31], the distinction between mono- and trirutile cation ordering is difficult. On the other hand, structural/electronic considerations on the rutile cell [24] suggest that an expansion of the rutile cell volume together with a contraction in the cla cell dimensions may be expected in the change from mono- to trirutile- like cation ordering due to the incorporation of SbS+ into antimonate. The results shown in Fig. 1 thus suggest that as the Sb : V ratio in V-Sb-oxide increase, a change from a mono- to trirutile-like cation ordering occurs. Increasing the Sb : V ratio thus not only (a) decreases the amount of V5+-oxide overlayer, (b) increases the amount of amorphous SbS+-oxide overlayer and (c) increases the presence of crystalline a-Sb204, but also (d) changes the non- stoichiometric characteristics of the rutile phase, possibly with an increased contribution of long-range trirutile-like cation ordering. 2.2. Changes after the catalytic tests After the catalytic tests a considerable modification in the phase composition is usually detected [18,19,24,32-34]. In comparison with fresh samples, a drastic decrease in the relative intensity of the band assigned to VS+-oxide is observed. The band, however, does not completely disappear, but the maximum shifts from 1020 to about 980 cm-1. The shift is analogous to that observed in VzOs-TiO2 catalysts [35] upon thermal spreading of vanadium and formation of a monolayer of hydrated VS+-oxide. It may be concluded that during catalytic reaction most of the VS+-oxide reduces, especially in samples with low Sb : V ratio, but a thin film 148 G. Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 or patches of VS+-oxide over vanadium antimonate crystallites is still present after catalytic tests. Furthermore, in some cases the reaction between reduced vanadium and antimony oxides [36], Sb204 q- V203 -q- Sb203 \"-~ 2VOSb204 was observed [18,19], even though the VOSb204 phase was always detected in small amounts. Vanadium, reduced during the catalytic reaction, reasonably forms V4+ ions, because (i) a rapid redox reaction between V3+ and V5+ to form 2V4+ was observed [ 18] and (ii) V3+ is easily reoxidized in the presence of gaseous oxygen. However, V4+ ions formed during the catalytic reaction may (a) remain spread over vanadium antimonate or Sb204 crystallites or (b) react with them to form a V204-VSbO4 solid solution. The analysis of the structural characteristics of the samples [ 19,24] indicates that the reduction of V5+ during catalytic tests leads also to a change in its dispersion/interaction with vanadium antimonate or antimony- oxide crystallites. On the other hand, the amount of crystalline VSbO4 does not change significantly before and after catalytic tests [24]. However, a modification is observed in the cell volume of the rutile phase which expands after catalytic tests in parallel with a reduction in the c/a ratio [24]. The cell volume for rutile V204 is 58.97 and thus a decrease in the cell volume is expected in the case of the formation of a solid solution between V204 and VSbO4 rutile phases. The expansion of cell volume indicates a probable change from a rutile to a trirutile structure as a consequence of the dissolution of Sb5+ into rutile and cation ordering to form the trirutile superstructure [29,30]. The results thus suggest that during catalytic reaction VS+-oxide reduces to V4+-oxide, but the dissolution of this into vanadium antimonate to form a solid solution is limited as well as the reaction of reduced vanadium with antimony oxide to form vanadium antimonate or side phases. Possibly, a surface intergrowth of va+-oxide patches over the vanadium anti- monate phase is present. SbS+-oxide instead reacts with the rutile vanadium antimonate phase leading to structural reorganization. 2.3. Non-stoichiometry of rutile-type vanadium antimonate The nature of the vanadium antimonate phase depends considerably on the preparation conditions and especially on the oxygen partial pressure during the heating treatment. Birchall and Sleight [20] indicated the formation of a Vo.92Sbo,9204 phase when equimolar V205 reacts with Sb203 at 800 in air and Vl.o5Sbo.9504 when the reaction is carried out in a closed tube. Later, Berry et al. [21] reported two different reduced phases: one prepared in a closed tube or in flowing commercial N2, with the composition VSbl_yO4_2y (0<y<0.1) and a second when prepared in flowing, oxygen-free, nitrogen, with composition VSbl-yO4-1.5y (0<y<0.1). The various phases differ in cell parameters; the phase obtained in the presence of oxygen has expanded a=b parameters and a contracted G. Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 149 c parameter. Teller et al. [23] also noted the possible formation of non-stoichio- metric vanadium antimonate, reporting that the formation of a vanadium anti- monate phase with the a and b lattice parameters (tetragonal cell) expanded and c parameter contracted probably forms when vanadium antimonate grows epitaxi- ally over fl-Sb204 crystallites. Teller et al. [23] also indicate that in epitaxially grown Vl_~Sbl_aO4 the metal-oxygen octahedron is somewhat squashed with respect to symmetric \"normal\" vanadium antimonate, possibly due to excess Sb. Therefore, the results of Teller et al. [23] show that oxygen partial pressure during thermal treatment is not the only factor determining the non-stoichiometric and structural characteristics of the vanadium antimonate phase. Hansen et al. [37], instead, pointed out that the cation-deficient rutile structure prepared in air is a mixed-valence compound with the following composition: 1..5+ xr3+ xr4+ r--'n x When the synthesis of vanadium antimonate is made in t)0.92v0.28 v0.64 t_._l 0.16u4 flowing gas with varying O2/N2 ratios, a continuous non-stoichiometric series of rutile-type Sbo.9Vo.9+x[--]o.2_xO4 (0<x<0.2) phases can be obtained [38] with a progressive increase in the V3+/V4+ ratio from the oxidized endmember 5+ 3+ 4+ Sb0.9V0.1W0.8[-]0.204 to the reduced endmember 5+ 3+ 4+ Sbo.9Vo.9Vo.2 [\"]0.004. A parallel decrease in the a=b parameter and increase in the c parameter of the tetragonal rutile cell was noted. The presence of a V3+/W4+ mixed-valence in vanadium antimonate is in agreement with the results obtained by chemical analysis of V-Sb- oxide samples [18]. Hansen et al. [37,38] suggest also a different interpretation for the bands at 880 and 1016 cm- l assigned not to surface amorphous V5+- and Sb5+- oxide phases, respectively (see previous discussion), but instead to the stretching mode of one- and two-coordinated oxygen of rutile phase, respectively. Oxygens in rutile structure are usually tri-coordinated, but when cation vacancies are created in the structure, coordinatively unsaturated oxygen species can be formed. In fact, these authors observed that the intensity of these bands parallel the creation of cation defects in rutile structure in samples prepared at high temperature (800) from equimolar mechanical mixtures of V205 and SbaO3 and variable oxygen partial pressures during heat treatment [38]. However, in their discussion the possibility of surface amorphous species is not considered and furthermore the interpretation contrast with the experimental evidence that the intensity of these bands is not correlated (change in an opposite way increasing the Sb : V ratio) and furthermore changes as a function of Sb : V ratio and preparation method, but in samples all prepared by heat treatment in air. The attribution of above bands to defective oxygen sites is thus not well supported by experimental evidences, although it is possible that the actual bands derive from the overlap of more than one component and thus that both interpretations are correct. Further studies are necessary to clarify this question. In conclusion, the results of Hansen et al. [37,38] indicate that the change in cell parameters as a function of Sb/V ratio and thermal treatment in air or during catalytic tests may not be related only to the formation of cation ordering such as in the trirutile structure, but also to change in non-stoichiometry characteristics of 150 G. Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 rutile phase. However, all the structural investigations cited above refer to samples prepared only by solid state reaction of equimolar mixtures of Sb203 and V205 at 800 or higher temperatures. These conditions are rather different from those for the preparation of V-Sb-oxide catalysts [ 19]. The problem of the exact structure of the active vanadium antimonate phase and of its dependence on the Sb/V ratio, method of preparation, thermal treatment and gas phase composition is thus still an open question which needs to be clarified. 3. Catalytic and kinetics behavior Due to the influence of the preparation method on the structural and phase composition characteristics [18,19], the catalytic behavior of V-Sb-oxide was found to depend considerably on the method of preparation. Nevertheless, some common features were observed in all samples. The main common aspects of the V-Sb-oxide catalysts during propane ammoxidation are discussed in this section, in order to outline the relevant features of the reaction network and kinetics of reaction as well as some specific aspects of the reactivity useful to discuss the reaction mechanism. The structure-activity and selectivity relationships are dis- cussed in Section 4. Compared in Fig. 2 is the selectivity to propene and acrylonitrile as a function of the conversion of propane over unsupported (case A) and alumina supported (B) V-Sb-oxide with a Sb/V ratio of 3 [32-34,39,40].

G. Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 151 selectivity-conversion trend are observed from sample to sample, the data of Fig. 2 are indicative of a general behavior observed in V-Sb-based mixed oxide catalysts. In both supported and unsupported V-Sb-oxide, propene is the primary product at low propane conversion and its selectivity decreases with increasing conversion together with a contemporaneous increase in the selectivity to acrylonitfile. The latter product passes through a maximum and then decreases for the higher propane conversions with a parallel increase in the formation of carbon oxides. This indicates that the main route to acrylonitrile passes through the formation of propene as an intermediate. It may be noted, however, that the extrapolation to zero conversion of the formation of acrylonitrile suggests that a parallel route of direct acrylonitrile formation from propane exists, especially in unsupported samples. This indication is confirmed by the kinetic analysis of the reaction of propane ammoxidation and tests at variable space-velocity [32,39,40] which indicate the presence of the two routes of acrylonitrile formation, the main route with the intermediate formation of propene and a secondary path of direct propane to acrylonitrile transformation. The second aspect of the reactivity, based on the data of Fig. 2 is that the selectivity of acrylonitrile passes through a defined maximum for relatively low propane conversions. The modification of the catalyst composition may shift and broaden the selectivity vs. conversion curve, as shown in Fig. 2 from the comparison between supported (B) and unsupported (A) samples. However, the maximum selectivity is always observed for propane conversions considerably lower than 100%. For this reason, a reasonable technological option is to operate at the maximum of selectivity and recycle unreacted propane. This would imply the use of relatively high propane concentrations and oxygen as the limiting reactant. Complete ammonia and oxygen conversion, furthermore, would be preferable when propane is recycled. Conditions of high propane concentrations and low 02 to propane ratio are those cited in several patents as optimal [1-3]. The third aspect, based on the data of Fig. 2 is that propene is usually present in significant amounts at the conditions of the maximum acrylonitrile selectivity. This indicates that the rate of propene to acrylonitrile transformation is relatively slow in comparison with the rate of propane to propene transformation. In agreement, several patented formulations are based on the use of co-catalysts to improve the rate of propene to acrylonitrile transformation [1-3]. Other products are detected in propane ammoxidation and in particular, acet- onitrile and HCN. Their selectivity is usually lower than 10% and their kinetics of formation indicate that they form both from propane and the propene intermediate, but especially from the latter. The overall reaction network is summarized in Scheme 1 [39]. The kinetic analysis [39,40] shows that the rate of propene, acrylonitrile, acetonitrile and HCN formation can be described, according to a Langmuir- Hinshelwood model, on the basis of two different sites for propane and for O2 and NH3 adsorption. Competition for chemisorption exists, as shown by the presence of 152 G. Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 ~'~ CH3CN HCN ~ / Scheme 1.

Another interesting effect of ammonia on the surface reactivity of V-Sb-oxide is shown in Fig. 3 which reports the effect of NH3 to C3H8 ratio on the product distribution at iso-conversion of propane (15%). In the absence of ammonia, the catalyst shows a low selectivity to partial oxidation products. Propylene is the main reaction product, besides carbon oxides, but small amounts of acrolein and acrylic acid are also detected. When low amounts of ammonia are added to the feed, a considerable decrease in the formation of carbon oxides is observed with a parallel increase in the selectivity to propene as well as initially also in that to acro- lein+acrylic acid (RCHO+RCOOH). The formation of nitriles is also observed, but data show that for NH3/C3H8 ratios below 0.5-1.0 the main nitrile formed is acetonitrile and not acrylonitrile (ACN). For higher NH3/C3H8 ratios, acrylonitrile becomes the main product together with propene. It should also be noted that the selectivity to acroleincrylic acid, propene and acetonitfile passes through a maximum as a function of the ammonia concentration in the feed. A change in the acetonitrile to acrylonitrile ratio has also been observed as a function of the reaction temperature [42]. The CH3CN/ACN ratio is maximum at low temperatures (below 450) and decreases continuously up to 500. In a V- G. Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 153 Sb-oxide sample with Sb : V=I.0 the CH3CN/ACN ratio passes from 0.60 at 440 to 0.18 at 500, whereas the ratio is about a third over a sample with Sb : V=3.0 (0.23 and 0.08, respectively). These results show that the product distribution is considerably affected by both reaction temperature and gas feed composition. These effects can be explained in terms of influence of chemisorbed ammonia species on the surface reactivity and presence of competitive pathways of propane conversion [41-43]. These aspects will be discussed in subsequent sections. A side reaction not indicated in Scheme 1, but which has a considerable effect on the catalytic behavior, is the direct oxidation of NH3 to N2. Due to both the more severe reaction conditions and the presence of vanadium, catalysts active in propane ammoxidation show a considerably higher rate of ammonia oxidation than catalysts active in propene ammoxidation. This side reaction of ammonia oxidation is negative both for the higher consumption of ammonia and its effect on the reduction of the ammonia species available on the surface for acrylonitrile synthesis. The latter phenomenon is clearly related to a lowering of the rate of propene to acrylonitrile transformation and thus on the selective behavior. In fact, a relationship between conversion of NH3 to N2 and selectivity to acrylonitrile in a series of V-Sb-oxide catalysts with different Sb : V ratio and preparation (Fig. 4) was observed [32,44]. Ammonia also has a negative effect on the reactivity of V-Sb-oxide towards propane conversion [41,45,46], especially at the lower reaction temperatures and ammonia concentrations. When the NH3 to C3H8 ratio is increased from 0 to 0.7, for example, the propane conversion at 480 drops from 38% to 17% [41], 6O 50 Z o30 -~ ~o 10 SelecL ACN Select. propene 0 .... I ....

Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 whereas a further increase in ammonia concentration does not further significantly depress the activity. Instead below about 450 the addition of ammonia nearly completely blocks the surface reactivity [45,46]. Ammonia thus leads to a partial inhibition of the surface reactivity, although reversible. It should be noted, however, that different observations have been reported about the effect of ammonia. Osipova et al. [47] and Sokolovskii et al. [4] indicated that over Ga- Sb-Ni-P-oxide catalysts the rate of propane depletion is proportional to ammonia concentration within the 0-0.4% NH3 range, whereas it does not affect the rate at higher NH3 concentrations, Nilsson et al. [48] observed that the rate of propane depletion is nearly independent of the ammonia concentration over V-Sb-oxide, but data on the reaction kinetics are not complete. The question of the effect of ammonia on the surface reactivity is thus unclear and probably depends on the specific characteristics of the catalyst studied. 4. Structure-activity and selectivity relationships 4.1. Effect of Sb : V ratio The Sb:V ratio has a considerable effect on the catalytic behavior of homologous V-Sb-oxide samples in acrylonitrile synthesis [48-50]. An example of this effect for unsupported V-Sb-oxide prepared by the precipitation-deposition method [24] is shown in Fig. 5.

Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 155 these feed conditions are preferable for process development as discussed in Section 3. As the Sb:V ratio increases from 0.8 to 3.0 the selectivity to acrylonitrile increases from about 15% to above 60% with a parallel decrease in the selectivity to propene. The selectivity to carbon oxides decreases only slightly from about 20% to 15%, whereas the conversion of propane is nearly constant. A drastic decrease is instead noted in the side reaction of unselective conversion of ammonia to N2 and likewise in the total conversion of ammonia; the trend with the Sb : V atomic ratio parallels closely the decrease in propene selectivity. Due to the decrease in the rate of this side reaction, the conversion of oxygen (limiting reactant) also decreases from about 100% (Sb:V<_I.0) to about 80% (Sb : V=3.0). The Sb : V ratio influences both structural aspects and phase composition in V- Sb-oxide samples, as discussed in Section 2. Therefore, it is not easy to derive a possible structure-activity and selectivity relationship. The data of Fig. 5 show that with increasing Sb : V ratio (i) the rate of the side reaction of ammonia conversion to N2 decreases considerably, in agreement with the previous discussion, and (ii) the sum of selectivities to propene and to acrylonitrile remain nearly constant, but their relative ratio changes. It also has been observed that with increasing Sb : V ratio various aspects of the phase composition in Sb-V-oxide catalysts are modified: (a) the amount of supported V5+- and SbS+-oxides decreases and (b) the amount of ol-Sb204 increases. Furthermore, the structural characteristics of the rutile phase also change due to the incorporation of Sb5+ and change in the non- stoichiometric characteristics of the rutile phase. 4.2. Role of vanadium species The role of supported VS+-oxide in catalyzing the selective oxidation of ammonia to N2 is known (for example, in V-oxide supported over TiO2 [51]). It is thus reasonable to attribute the decrease in the rate of the side reaction NH3--~N2 to the lowering in the amount of unreacted surface VS+-oxide with increasing Sb : V ratio. Such a correlation was proposed on the basis of XPS data [32,33] and found to be in agreement with the observed change in the conversion of NH3 to N2 vs. formation of acrylonitrile in a transient reactivity study on calcined V-Sb-oxide [19,52]. Nilsson et al. [48-50] suggested also that the higher selec- tivity for catalysts with a Sb : V ratio higher than 1.0 is a consequence of the poisoning of V5+ sites with supra-surface antimony oxide species. The latter species reacts with vanadium ions converting them to V4+(V3 sub-surface species and leading to a reconstruction of the vanadium antimonate surface. Nilsson et al. [48-50], however, suggested that the modification of the oxide surface during catalytic tests improves the selectivity because the formation of degradation products (acetonitrile, carbon oxides) is depressed, and not as a consequence of the effect of VS+-oxide species on the NH3---~N2 reaction.

(B) Correlation in the same samples of Fig. 6(A), but after the catalytic tests, between NH3---+N2 conversion and relative amounts of VS+-oxide or c/a ratio in the unit cell of the ruffle phase. The amount of VS+-oxide is expressed as percent with respect to the amount of VS+-oxide determined in the sample with the higher amount of this phase in the series of samples examined [24]. G. Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 157 should be noted, however, that their tests were made only at low hydrocarbon conversion (below 5-10%) and the oxidation of NH3 to nitrogen was not analyzed. VS+-oxide supported over a vanadium antimonate matrix is characterized by an infrared band in the 1000-1020 cm-1 region (Uv=o). In crystalline V205 this band falls at 1022 cm-1, but the spreading over an oxide surface leads to a shift to slightly lower frequencies. Therefore, a rough estimate of the relative amount of vS+-oxide phase in V-Sb-oxide samples can be made on the basis of the deconvolution of the IR spectra [24]. Reported in Fig. 6 is the conversion of ammonia to N2 plotted as a function of the estimated relative amount of V5+-oxide in the sample before and after catalytic tests (A and B, respectively) [24]. As discussed before, the conversion of NH3 to N2 is related to the selectivity to acrylonitrile. A good correlation between the side conversion of ammonia and the relative amount of V5+ is observed, but only in the calcined sample (Fig. 6(A)). The relationship is negligible in the catalysts after the catalytic tests (Fig. 6(B)). This indicates that not only the presence of unreacted VS+-oxide should be considered, but also the nature of the changes occurring in situ to the catalyst surface during the catalytic tests. Also shown in Fig. 6(B) is the relationship observed between NH3---~N2 conversion and c/a parameter of the tetragonal rutile cell after the catalytic tests which suggest that the structural characteristics of the rutile phase and in particular the change from a vanadium- rich to antimony-rich non-stoichiometric rutile phase probably plays an important catalytic role on the surface selectivity. This effect of non-stoichiometric char- acteristics of the rutile-type vanadium antimonate on the surface reactivity agrees well with the suggestions of Nilsson et al. [48-50] mentioned above. Although vanadium ions catalyze side reactions which affect the selectivity in propane ammoxidation, their presence is required both for activity and selectivity. This is shown, for example, from the lowering of both selectivity and activity shown by V-Sb-oxide after removal of surface amorphous vS+-oxide phase by extraction in an aqueous ammonia solution. It was observed, for example, that both conversion and selectivity to acrylonitrile approximately halves after such a type of treatment [44]. Nilsson et al. [48-50] showed that in unsupported V-Sb-oxide the rate of both propane and propene depletion per me of surface area increases nearly linearly, 1-2 orders of magnitude, in going from pure antimony oxide to stoichio- metric vanadium antimonate. These results show that vanadium ions play a role in both the step from propane to propene and the step of further conversion of the intermediate propene. However, when the Sb/(Sb+V) ratio is changed as in the Nilsson et al. [48-50] experiments, there is a contemporaneous change in both activity and selectivity as well as in the structural, textural and phase composition properties. Therefore, it is difficult to identify the exact role of vanadium on the surface reactivity properties. The effect of vanadium on the surface reactivity properties, however, is further clarified in the experiments summarized in Table 1 [32] where the behavior in propane ammoxidation of a catalyst prepared by addition of SbS+-oxide over 158 G. Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 Table 1 Comparison of the catalytic behavior in propane ammoxidation at 500 of a Sb-oxide (30% wt) on alumina and calcined at 900 with that of the same sample doped with 1% wt vanadium-oxide and calcined again at 900 [32] Sample Propane NH3 conv.

Characterization of the undoped sample [32] indicates the formation of A1SbO4 supported on alumina, with the former phase isostructural with vanadium antimonate. Doping with vanadium oxide produces the formation of a (V, A1)SbO4 solid solution or intergrown rutile phase [32]. The comparison of the catalytic behavior of these two samples (Table 1) shows that doping of the A1SbO4/A1203 matrix with vanadium leads to relatively small modifications in the activity, but a drastic change in the selectivity. The sample without vanadium is able to activate propane selectively, but mainly towards acetonitrile. On the contrary, when vanadium ions are introduced in the Al-antimonate rutile matrix, acrylonitrile (ACN) forms with relatively high selectivity, notwithstanding that the vanadium content is low (about a Sb : V ratio of 10). The data of Table 1 suggest that the propane ammoxidation pathway over Sb--Al-oxide is predominantly an acid catalyzed reaction which leads primarily to acetonitrile, HCN and COx via formation of the chemisorbed propene intermediate [32]. It is catalyzed probably by [A1-O-Sb]+ acid sites. However, there are also [Sb-O-Sb] selective oxidation sites from whence a chemisorbed propene, once formed, can yield an allylic intermediate which, in the presence of ammonia, results in desorbed acrylonitrile. On V-Sb-Al-oxide, the propane ammoxidation pathway is metalloradical initiated probably by [V=O] sites. The primary intermediate is again propene which now encounters many more oxidation than acid sites, with the concomitant result of yielding acrylonitrile as the major useful product. Vanadium ions thus not only provide the sites for alkane activation, but also help in the reoxidation mechanism of the [Sb-O-Sb] sites. The interpretation of the data in Table 1 is thus in substantial agreement with the results of Nilsson et al. [48-50], but further suggest the role of vanadium on the mechanism of activation and transformation, as well as the role of surface acid sites in catalyzing side reactions. The latter aspect will be discussed further in Section 4.3. 4.3. Role of antimony species The change in Sb : V ratio affects not only the nature and relative amount of vanadium species, but also that of antimony species, and also influences the non- G.

The amount of Sb- oxide phases is expressed as percent with respect to the maximum amount of the same in the series of samples examined. stoichiometric characteristics of vanadium antimonate. Increasing the Sb : V ratio, in particular, increases the presence of both supported SbS+-oxide and o~-Sb204. However, when the amount of supported SbS+-oxide and o~-Sb204 is estimated by IR spectra deconvolution in a homologous series of samples and plotted against the selectivity to acrylonitrile from propane for the same series of sample [24], a roughly linear relationship with the amount of supported SbS+-oxide is observed (Fig. 7), whereas correlation with the amount of o~-Sb204 is rather negligible. This suggests that the latter phase may be considered as a side phase with limited, or negligible functionality in the mechanism of propane ammoxidation to acryloni- trile. Supported SbS+-oxide instead plays a catalytic role in determining the selectivity to acrylonitrile. This confirms the data of Fig. 6(B) suggesting that the surface modification of the rutile V-antimonate phase due to the reaction with supported SbS+-oxide is a key aspect of the surface reactivity of Sb-V-oxides and determines the ratio of the rates of ammonia side conversion to N2 and of ammonia used for propene conversion to acrylonitrile. 4.4. Role of non-stoichiometry of vanadium antimonate Nilsson et al. [48-50] proposed that the selective behavior of V-Sb-oxide is associated with the creation of supra-surface antimony sites over vanadium 160 G. Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 antimonate. This suggestion agrees well with the previous discussion about the improvement of catalytic behavior in changing from a vanadium-rich to an antimony-rich non-stoichiometric rutile vanadium antimonate due to both the surface reconstruction occurring during the catalytic reaction and the Sb : V ratio. On the other hand, discussion in Section 2.3 showed that non-stoichiometric characteristics of the rutile vanadium antimonate phase depend not only on the above factors, but also on the mechanism of crystal growth. In particular, data of Teller et al. [23] indicated that Sb-rich vanadium antimonate may also form when the crystals grow over/3-Sb204 crystallites. It was observed, in agreement, that the selective behavior in propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile in a series of V-Sb- oxides prepared with different methods, but comparable physico-chemical and phase composition properties, can be correlated with the relative dimensions of vanadium antimonate and Sb204 crystallites and the mechanism of vanadium antimonate formation [53]. In particular, the preparation leading to the more selective catalysts was that corresponding to vanadium antimonate microcrystals growing over larger plate-like o~-5b204 crystallites. Present data do not allow determination of whether the improved selectivity characteristics of Sb-rich vanadium antimonate are due to the creation of distor- tions in site environment which improve the reactivity of the sites or to the improved catalytic properties of Sb-oxide supra-surface sites. In other words, whether the active sites are located on the surface of the ruffle phase, but with catalytic properties that depend on non-stoichiometric characteristics of the rutile phase, or the active sites are located at the supra-surface Sb-oxide, the steady-state reactivity of which, however, depends on the action of vanadium sites located in the rutile matrix in catalyzing the reoxidation of the reduced antimony sites. Nilsson et al. [48] suggest that the non-stoichiometric characteristics of vana- dium antimonate determine the presence of 2-coordinated oxygen sites. Teller et al. [23] pointed out the presence of distortion in the metal-oxygen octahedra. Nilsson et al. [48] noted also that supra-surface Sb-oxide reoxidizes faster. Using IR spectroscopy, Centi and Perathoner [52] observed that when supra-surface Sb- oxide is present, the extent of surface reduction during anaerobic interaction of the catalyst with ammonia or hydrocarbon at 450 is lower. This result showed the role of reoxidation of supra-surface Sb-oxide on the catalytic behavior. This is confirmed by transient reactivity studies [52] showing that the rate of acrylonitrile synthesis is controlled by the rate of catalyst reoxidation. However, transient reactivity data [52] indicated also that acrylonitrile forms only when reoxidation of the unsupported V-Sb-oxide catalyst is complete. In fact, as shown in Fig. 8, different delays in the reaching of a constant acrylonitrile formation after addition of gaseous oxygen to the propane and ammonia feed are observed as a function of the time of prereduction in a feed of propaneH3 diluted in helium. It should be noted, in particular, that in the case of the longer prereduction time, acrylonitrile starts to form only when gaseous oxygen appears in the gas phase and the reoxidation of the catalyst is nearly complete. Taking into account that probably G. Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 161 04 J..

Reasonably, both the presence of supra-surface Sb-oxide and the non-stoichiometric characteristics of vanadium antimonate are the factors determining the selective synthesis of acrylonitrile, but further studies are necessary to clarify this point. The results of Fig. 8 and of transient reactivity data [52], however, clearly indicate the role of catalyst structural oxygens in the mechanism of acrylonitrile formation and the role of surface redox properties in the rate of acrylonitrile synthesis. 5. Mechanism of propane ammoxidation 5.1. Surface properties and competitive pathways of propane conversion Kinetic [39,40,48] and transient reactivity [52] data show that propene is the main intermediate in propane ammoxidation. Furthermore, the formation of acrolein from propene [50] and acrolein and acrylic acid in small amounts in 162 G. Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 propane conversion in the presence of an ammonia deficiency (see Fig. 3) [41] over V-Sb-oxide catalysts is indicated. However, it was not possible to determine whether these products are intermediates to acrylonitrile or only products formed when ammonia is absent. Data to discuss this problem may be obtained by IR characterization of (i) chemisorbed species formed by interaction of possible precursors of adspecies, and (ii) their thermal transformation over the catalyst in the presence or not of coadsorbed ammonia [41--43]. In fact, competition always exists between oxidation and ammoxidation pathways of reaction, as shown in detail later, and thus a correct approach to the identification of the reaction mechanism in propane ammoxidation should start from the identification of the competitive reactions present in propane only transformation, analyzing then the influence of ammonia chemisorption on this surface chemistry. The IR analysis of the surface reactivity of several of the possible precursor molecules of adsorbed intermediates (acetone, isopropyl and allyl alcohols, acrylic acid, propene, propionic acid, propane, acrylonitrile) [43] gives useful indication on (i) the key reactivity characteristics of V-Sb-oxide and its multifunctional properties, and (ii) the surface reaction network in propane conversion in the absence of chemisorbed ammonia. For conciseness, the second aspect is only discussed here, whereas reference is made to the original paper about the first aspect [43, part 1] as well as about the IR evidences which allow to derive the surface reaction network. The surface reaction network in propane conversion on V-Sb-oxide in the absence of chemisorbed ammonia is shown in Scheme 2 [43]. The main route of propane conversion is through the formation of propene as the intermediate, although a side reaction of acrylate formation via propionate intermediate is possible. It is also reasonable that the relative importance of this side reaction is higher in the case of oxidation than of ammoxidation, due to the competitive chemisorption of ammonia on Lewis acid sites suggested as being responsible for the first step of hydrogen abstraction in this side route. Furthermore, the nature of the catalyst and the use of a support influences the relative rate of these two pathways, as suggested by the previous discussion regarding data shown in Fig. 2.

Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 163 A direct conversion of propane to carbon oxides is also hypothesized, because tests with propane indicate that propane may react fast with a vanadium-oxide species supported on the V-antimonate matrix to give mainly carbon oxides and water. The characterization of V-Sb-oxide catalysts after catalytic tests of propane ammox- idation [32,33,48-50] indicate that this species reduces quickly during the first minutes of catalytic reaction with a contemporaneous increase in the selectivity [52]. The importance of this direct route of propane combustion, therefore, decreases when the catalyst approaches the steady-state activity. Propene may be oxidized according to two routes, the first reversible and favored at low temperatures with the formation of an isopropylate species by reaction with Brcnsted sites, and the second with the formation of an allyl alcoholate by abstraction of allylic hydrogen and nucleophilic lattice oxygen attack. The first adspecies easily transforms to acetone which may be oxidatively cleaved to an acetate species and a C1 fragment. The second adspecies transforms instead to acrolein which easily further converts to an acrylate species. The acrylate species strongly interacts with the surface and is thermally stable up to relatively high temperatures. The strong interaction with the surface and therefore the low rate of desorption as acrylic acid is probably one of the reasons for the low selectivity to products of partial oxidation of V-Sb-oxide in propane oxidation in the absence of ammonia. Although IR data suggest a fast conversion of propene to acrylate or acetate species, the strong interaction of the latter two products limits considerably their possible desorption as acrylic and acetic acid. In the presence of gaseous oxygen, acrylate or acetate species thus are more prone to further oxidation to carbon oxides. The increase in the selectivity in partial oxidation products makes it necessary to decrease the interaction of these products with the surface by suitable doping. The effect of ammonia which significantly increases the selectivity (see Section 5.2) may thus be viewed as a double effect, one to convert these intermediates to acrylonitrile which is more weakly bound to the surface and the second related to the effect of ammonia as a base agent. Ammonia chemisorption modifies the acidity characteristics of the surface, favoring the rate of product desorption. In agreement, it can be observed in Fig. 3 that even a small addition of ammonia to the feed considerably increases the selectivity to products of partial oxidation, even without being enough to form acrylonitrile. 5.2. Influence of ammonia chemisorption on the surface reactivity 5.2.1. Ammonia adspecies and relationship with surface properties The nature of ammonia adspecies, the influence on their relative amount of the temperature of contact of ammonia with the catalyst and of evacuation, and the influence of the catalyst nature (preparation method, Sb : V ratio) were discussed by Centi et al. [41,43]. In general, the presence of the bands of ammonia coordinated on Lewis acid sites and the bands of ammonium ion were detected 164 G. Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 [41; 43, part 2]. While the first species is stable up to very high evacuation temperatures (about 400) indicating strong bonding, the latter species decreases considerably in intensity even after evacuation at 100, indicating a medium- weak acid strength of the Br~nsted sites. However, in the presence of coadsorbed water, ammonium ions were the predominant species even after thermal treatment at high temperature (about 350) [43, part 3]. Furthermore, it was observed that the nature of ammonia adspecies at r.t. may be used to monitor the nature of the surface characteristics of V-Sb-oxide [43, part 2]. The results indicate that in stoichiometric V-Sb-oxide (Sb : V=I.0) the surface BrCnsted site properties are more close to those of pure VS+-oxide, whereas at higher Sb : V atomic ratios the BrCnsted site properties resemble those of pure SbS+-oxide. Increasing the Sb : V ratio, furthermore, changes the relative amount of surface acid sites. It was observed by quantitative estimation of chemisorbed ammonia species that increasing the Sb : V ratio increases the amount of BrCnsted sites, but decreases the amount of Lewis acid sites [43]. However, the acid strength of these sites is not significantly affected by Sb : V ratio. The nature of ammonia adspecies determines also their reactivity towards the side reaction of ammonia oxidation to N2 and in turn the selectivity to acrylonitrile. Reported in Fig. 9 is the relationship observed between amount of ammonium ions and selectivity to acrylonitrile or to the NH3--~N2 reaction [43]. Instead, more random data were observed in correlating the same factors with the amount of ammonia coordinated over Lewis acid sites.

Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 165 relationship with the conversion of NH3 to N2 indicate that ammonium ions play a significant role in the propene to acrylonitrile step and in limiting the side conversion of ammonia, although not necessarily imply that ammonium ions are the active ammonia species in the mechanism of propane ammoxidation. This aspect is discussed in more detail later. A rough correlation was also observed between activity of the V-Sb-oxide catalysts in propane conversion and amount of Lewis sites, i.e. they increase in the same direction. However, ammonia forms with Lewis acid sites strongly chemi- sorbed species, stable at temperatures comparable with those of the catalytic tests of propane ammoxidation. Ammonia has thus an inhibition effect on the activation of propane, as shown by reactivity data [41]. However, the competitive chemisorp- tion of ammonia and propane over Lewis acid vanadium sites depends reasonably on ammonia concentration in the feed which, in turn, is influenced by the side reaction of ammonia conversion to N2. Furthermore, ammonia chemisorption influences probably the rates of competitive paths of propane conversion, as previously discussed. It is thus not possible to single out the specific relationship between conversion of propane and amount of Lewis acid sites, but the common trend suggests the existence of such a relationship. The analysis of the reactivity of ammonia with catalyst structural oxygens and of the change of V-Sb-oxide characteristics upon interaction with ammonia [43, part 2] gives also useful indication on the nature of reactive species. IR data show that bridging oxygens linked to vanadium ions react with ammonia in relatively mild conditions to give NEq-H20, although gaseous oxygen can reoxidize the reduced sites in nearly the same range of temperatures. The results also indicate the presence of two different vanadium species active in ammonia oxidation and characterized by different activities towards ammonia. The first species, attributed to a VS+-species spread on the surface of V-antimonate reacts with ammonia at lower temperatures with respect to a second species, attributed to surface vanadium ions, but located in vanadium antimonate. However, this second species is reoxidized by gaseous oxygen at lower temperatures indicating that probably the first species initially reacts faster, but then in steady-state conditions the second species plays a more important role. In agreement, it has been observed in transient reactivity studies [19,52] that the catalyst approaches the steady-state catalytic behavior with a decrease in the rate of the reaction of NH3--~N2 and a parallel increase in the formation of acrylonitrile. 5.2.2. Effect of ammonia on surface acid-base properties and relationship with the catalytic behavior IR coadsorption experiments of propane, propene, allyl alcohol and acrylic acid with ammonia either present only in the adsorbed form or also in the gas phase give useful indication about the effect of ammonia chemisorption on the surface properties of V-Sb-oxide and the mechanism of propane ammoxida- tion [41,42]. 166 G. Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 In particular, IR coadsorption data indicate two main roles of chemisorbed ammonia species in the modification of the surface reactivity of V-Sb-oxide: (i) ammonia chemisorbed at Lewis acid sites influences the rate and selectivity in the step of propane activation and (ii) ammonium ions formed by reaction of NH3 with BrCnsted acid sites inhibit the reactivity of the BrCnsted sites themselves in catalyzing unselective side reactions. In particular, IR data on propene+NH3 coadsorption indicate that the route leading to carbon chain breakage and acetonitrile formation is inhibited when Br0nsted sites react with ammonia. Coadsorption experiments of acrylic acid and ammonia indicate that the inhibition of BrCnsted reactivity converting them into ammonium ions also plays a role in the transformation of adsorbed acrylate species. Coordinated acrylic acid and ammo- nia react readily at low temperature to form acrylamide further transformed at higher temperatures to acrylonitrile. However, when free Br0nsted sites are present, decomposition of the amide to free acrylic acid+NH3 occurs. The free acid is unstable and is readily further converted to carbon oxides. The transforma- tion of Br0nsted sites to ammonium ions also plays a key role in this step in determining the surface selectivity and thus ammonia does not only act as coreagent. 5.3. Surface reaction network in propane ammoxidation The surface reaction network in propane ammoxidation on V-Sb-oxide which can be deduced from above IR studies [41--43] is shown in Scheme 3. With dotted lines are reported reaction pathways which cannot be ruled out, although direct evidences about their existence were not obtained in the cited papers [41-43]. The details of the surface reaction network were discussed by Centi and Perathoner [43, part 3]. C3H8 o ~ H \"'\"'-.

Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 167 Propane is primarily converted to propene, but reasonably a route of direct conversion to carbon oxides also exist. Catalytic tests, in fact, indicate that at very low propene conversion a very high selectivity to propene (above 85%) can be obtained, but in all conditions a selectivity lower than 100% due to the formation of carbon oxides was observed. The secondary pathway shown in Scheme 2 of propane conversion via propionate intermediate was also omitted, because the relative importance of this secondary route is probably further depressed in the presence of ammonia as discussed above, and thus the importance of this route in propane ammoxidation is negligible. Propene intermediate may further convert along two main routes, besides the possible direct oxidation to carbon oxides and the desorption in the gas phase which was omitted in Scheme 3 for the sake of clarity. The two pathways of conversion of chemisorbed propene are to (i) acetone via isopropoxylate inter- mediate and (ii) acrolein via allyl alcoholate intermediate. The first reaction occurs preferentially at lower temperatures and in the presence of hydroxyl groups. When their reactivity is blocked by the faster reaction with ammonia, the second pathway of reaction becomes preferential. The first pathway of reaction is responsible for a degradative pathway, because acetone further transforms to an acetate species with carbon chain breakage. In the absence of ammonia adspecies the allyl alcoholate converts to acrolein and acrylate species. The latter reacts faster with ammonium ions to give an acrylamide intermediate. At higher temperatures the amide may be transformed to acrylonitrile, but when Brcnsted sites are present, the amide may be hydrolyzed to reform ammonia and free, weakly bonded, acrylic acid. The latter easily decarboxylate forming carbon oxides. In the presence of activated ammonia adspecies, tentatively NHz species formed by heterolytic dissociation of ammonia coordinated to Lewis acid sites, the allyl alcoholate gives rise to an acrylimine intermediate which transforms faster to the acrylonitrile than to the acrylamide intermediate. The more relevant feature of the proposed reaction network is that multiple pathways of reaction to acrylonitrile exist. The main route suggested by IR experiments is the sequence propane---~propene--~allyl alcoholate--~ acrylimine--,acrylonitrile, but reasonably the relative rate of the various pathways depends on the reaction conditions and nature of the catalyst. The competition of the insertion of NH in the allyl alcoholate to form the acrylimine intermediate or of H-abstraction to form acrolein and then acrylate species depends clearly on the properties of the catalyst such as activation of ammonia, H- abstraction and O-insertion properties. It is thus reasonable that the relative rates of these competitive routes may change as a function of the temperature of reaction, propane concentration and C3Hs/NH3 or C3Hs/O2 ratios, and catalyst characteristics (preparation method and Sb:V ratio). For the same reason, although present IR data do not support the existence of a path of (i) direct nitrogen insertion on propene intermediate (more precisely, on the 7r-allyl species formed by a H-abstraction on propene) by metal-imido species or (ii) direct 168 G. Centi et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 acrolein conversion to acrylonitrile and not via acrylate intermediate, these routes were outlined in Scheme 3, because in different experimental conditions of those used for IR studies these pathways may play a significant role in determining the catalytic behavior. A second concept shown in Scheme 3 is that the different routes to acrylonitrile possess an intrinsic different selectivity for the different possibility of side reactions. This is exemplified from the comparison of the route 1 (NH insertion on allyl alcoholate to form acrylimine intermediate) and route 2 (via acrylate species). The presence of reversible steps in route 2 and in particular, of an equilibrium between acrylate, acrylamide and undissociated acrylic acid consid- erably influences the selectivity in this path. In fact, the undissociated and weakly coordinated acid is probably the precursor for decarboxylation and further oxidation to carbon oxides. When ammonia concentration is too low (for example, at the end of the reactor bed in tests at high conversion), the equilibrium shifts towards the formation of the undissociated acid further easily converted to carbon oxides. Although not the only explanation, this interpretation can explain one of the key catalytic aspects of the reaction of propane ammoxidation over V-Sb-oxide catalysts, i.e. that good selectivities to acrylonitrile can be obtained only at relatively low propane conversion and increasing conversion selectivity to acrylonitrile decreases with a parallel increase of carbon oxides formation (Fig. 2). In order to limit this side reaction to carbon oxides (i) the concentration/ stability of ammonium ions and (ii) the rate of further dehydrogenation of acrylamide intermediate, should be increased. The proposed reaction network can be thus used as a tool for the design of catalysts with improved properties. 5.4. Role of vanadium in the reaction mechanism Characterization data (Section 2) show that at least two types of vanadium species exist in V-Sb-oxide: (i) amorphous VS+-oxide spread over vanadium antimonate, and (ii) vanadium ions in the vanadium antimonate. The character- istics and reactivity of the latter species, furthermore, depend considerably on the non-stoichiometric properties of rutile-type vanadium antimonate which, in turn, depend on Sb : V ratio, method of preparation and composition of the atmosphere during heat treatments (Section 2.3). The reactivity of the two species of vanadium is different. IR studies on the surface properties and reactivity of V-Sb-oxide [41-43] show that supra-surface VS+-oxide reacts faster both with propane or other organics than vanadium antimonate which reduces at higher temperatures. However, reoxidation in vana- dium antimonate is faster. Furthermore, XPS and IR evidence [32,33] indicates that supra-surface VS+-oxide reduces nearly completely during catalytic reaction. IR data [43] indicate that reduction of supra-surface VS+-oxide by contact with ammonia or organics gives rise to oxidation of (i) ammonia to N2 and (ii) organics G. Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 169 to carbon oxides. Tests with propane, in particular, show that the alkane reacts at low temperature with supra-surface VS+-oxide, but forming carbon oxides, whereas reaction of propane with vanadium antimonate leads at higher tempera- tures to the formation of oxygen vacancies associated with vanadium (Sec- tions 5.2.1 and 5.2.2), but also with detectable intermediate species (acrylate). This suggests that the reaction of supra-surface VS+-oxide is responsible for unselective conversion of propane to carbon oxides and of ammonia to N2 (Fig. 6), whereas vanadium antimonate is responsible for the selective synthesis of acrylonitrile. This agrees with the results of (i) transient catalytic tests showing an improvement in the formation of acrylonitrile and a decrease in the oxidation of ammonia during the reaching of steady-state activity on a calcined V-Sb-oxide [52] and (ii) the above IR observations indicating a faster reduction of supra-surface VS+-oxide, but a slower reoxidation in comparison with vanadium antimonate. The catalytic role of supra-surface VS+-oxide thus decreases in relative importance during catalyst activation in the feed mixture, but reasonably continues to play a role also in steady-state conditions. The decrease in the relative amount of this supra-surface VS+-oxide species with increasing Sb : V ratio and the parallel decrease in the conversion of NH3 to N2 and increase in the propene to acrylonitrile conversion (Fig. 5) is in good agreement with the above observations. Vanadium ions play two main catalytic roles in the mechanism of synthesis of acrylonitrile on V-Sb-oxide: (i) they constitute the active sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene and (ii) catalyze the reoxidation of surface Sb-sites reduced in the propene to acrylonitrile conversion. However, taking into consideration the role of vanadium ions on the rate of ammonia oxidation to N2 (Fig. 6), a third effect of vanadium can be associated with the influence on the nature and amount of ammonia adspecies. In the first step of propane activation, IR and reactivity studies indicate a role of Lewis acid sites associated with coordinatively unsaturated vanadium ions, reason- ably located at the surface of vanadium antimonate. Although specific data are not available, it is probable that non-stoichiometric properties of vanadium antimonate influence coordination and valence of surface vanadium ions and thus their activity. It should be noted, however, that two different mechanisms of alkane activation are probably present, the first involving methylenic proton abstraction by structural basic oxygens followed by further abstraction of H- by the methyl group of propane (assisted in electron transfer by redox surface sites) and the second involving a first direct H- abstraction by strong Lewis acid sites followed by oxygen nucleophilic attack on the same carbon atom and further H-abstraction (Section 5.2.2). In both cases the active sites are associated with vanadium ions, but in the first case the reactivity probably depends on the effect of vanadium (i) on the basic properties of structural bridging oxygens linked to it and (ii) its redox action in the electron transfer. In the second case, vanadium Lewis acidity plays instead a direct role. However, the second path is probably less selective and 170 G. Centi et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 inhibited by ammonia, in agreement with the considerable enhancement of selectivity to propene even for low doses of ammonia (Fig. 3) and the inhibition of ammonia on the rate of propane conversion (Section 3). Ammonia coordination, on the other hand, probably enhances the basic nature of the surface structural oxygens by an inductive effect. The second role of vanadium is to catalyze the reoxidation of surface antimony oxide sites reduced during propene to acrylonitrile conversion. Probably, the active sites are supra-surface Sb-oxide on vanadium antimonate (Sections 4.3 and 4.4; Fig. 7), but the non-stoichiometric characteristics of vanadium antimonate and thus the state of the vanadium ions probably influences the rate of reoxidation. The third catalytic role of vanadium is on the oxidation of ammonia to N2 which depends on the redox reaction of surface vanadium species, as discussed before. The effect of excess Sb-oxide in limiting the amount of supra-surface VS+-oxide is a key aspect of the selective behavior of V-Sb-oxide, because it limits the side conversion of ammonia. However, excess antimony also modifies the non-stoi- chiometry of vanadium antimonate and thus the state of vanadium in this phase which also is an important factor for selectivity (Fig. 6(B)). Vanadium species thus play different and in part contrasting roles in the mechanism of propane ammoxidation. However, present data do not allow the role of vanadium to be outlined completely and several of the above suggestions should be further verified for a better understanding of the relationship between vanadium species and catalytic behavior. 6. Conclusions Vanadium is a key component of V-Sb-oxide for propane ammoxidation and plays a role both in the step of propane to propene transformation and in the further conversion to acrylonitrile. The analysis of the structure/composition and activity relationships suggests that the active phase for the selective synthesis of acrylonitrile from propane is a non- stoichiometric rutile-like vanadium antimonate with SbS+-oxide supported on it. Vanadium species play a catalytic role in the selective activation of propane, although the presence of two competitive routes involving different centers associated with vanadium ions has been shown. Ammonia chemisorption, how- ever, selectively inhibits one of the two routes and favors the pathway through intermediate propene formation. Supra-surface VS+-oxide catalyzes the unselective NH3---~N2 conversion with a lowering in acrylonitrile selectivity. In addition, vanadium ions catalyze the reoxidation of supra-surface SbS+-oxide, the active species for acrylonitrile synthesis from intermediate propene. The reoxidation of supra-surface antimony oxide depends probably on the non-stoichiometry of vanadium antimonate and its influence on the state of vanadium. G. Centi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 143-172 171 The role of ammonia in the modification of surface reactivity (acid-base and redox properties) has also been shown as well as the presence of a complex surface network which explain various key features observed in the catalytic behavior. The design of new improved catalysts for propane ammoxidation thus requires a better understanding of all the above factors and finding the way for their control, but the study of this reaction offers several clues for the development of new classes of selective catalysts in alkane functionalization.

        "dc:description": "V-Sb-oxide catalysts are claimed in several patents as the active components for a new process of direct acrylonitrile synthesis from propane. In this review the main catalytic, kinetic and mechanistic features of these catalysts are discussed with reference to the role of vanadium as the key component. Specific topics discussed include: (i) nature of the phases present in V-Sb-oxide catalysts, their modification during the catalytic reaction and nature of the non-stoichiometry of vanadium antimonate, (ii) catalytic and kinetic behavior as well as some specific aspects which characterize their reactivity, (iii) structure-activity and selectivity relationships, and (iv) reaction mechanism, influence on the surface reactivity of chemisorbed species (ammonia, in particular) and presence of competitive pathways of transformation.",
