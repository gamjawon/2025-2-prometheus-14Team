A facile one-pot method using molten salt medium is developed to fabricate an open structured N-doped carbon (ONC) derived from biomass. SEM and TEM show the ONC is made up of interconnected thin amorphous carbon layers. N2 isotherm shows that ONC has hierarchical porous structure with a high specific surface area of 1893.5m2 g−1. Compared to commercial Pt/C (20wt%), the ONC has comparable ORR activity and better durability. Due to its high ORR activity and durability, producing an opened N-doped carbon in this molten salt medium can provide a promising approach for synthesizing heteroatom doped carbons with electrochemical performance. Graphical abstract An open structure of N-doped carbon with a high surface area of 1893.5m2 g−1 is synthesized from soybean dregs in NaCl/ZnCl2/NaNO3 molten salt medium. The ORR activity of as-prepared carbon is comparable to commercial Pt/C due to its unique structure. Unlabelled Image Keywords Open structure N-doped carbon Hierarchical pore Oxygen reduction reaction 1 Introduction High energy density systems, such as metal-air batteries and fuel cells, are highly expected to be used in transportation and electricity generation, which are currently dominated by using fossil fuels. Unfortunately, sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode of fuel cells and metal-air batteries required high Pt-loadings, impeding their practical applications, which has stimulated the researchers to exploit low-cost alternative to Pt-based catalysts with better performance or equivalent to the Pt standard [1–3]. Recently, nitrogen-doped (N-doped) carbon materials have attracted more and more attention due to its low-cost, abundance, inert to methanol and relative high ORR activity [4]. Among them, N-doped carbons with an open structure represented by a honeycomb-like appearance have gained tremendous attention since the open structure provides highly opened three-dimensional channels for facilitating mass diffusion of the electrolyte [5–7]. A series of methods have been developed to tailor the open structure in N-doped carbon materials, for instance, using templates, such as nano-sized silica [8], nickel foam [9], MCM-48 [10] or ordered metal oxides [11]. It was also reported that the open structure in N-doped carbon network could be made using KOH etching agent at elevated temperature [12]. It is quite difficult to scale up from cost and environmental point of views because some extremely corrosive chemicals are required to etch part of the carbon or to remove the templates. Recently, opened N-doped carbons have also been prepared from the polymer in molten salt medium, which has a much less impact on the environment [13,14]. However, most of N-doped carbons prepared in molten salt medium did not present the open structure, although they have rich micropores or/and mesopores [15,16]. It indicates that the obtained open structure in N-doped carbons is still a challenging task. When applied in ORR 4e procedure, optimized porosity in heteroatom-doping carbon is favorable for mass transfer. While in the doped N species, pyridinic-N provides a pair of electrons to bond with the p-conjugated rings and graphitic-N can bring about lower overpotential for ORR [17,18]. The latter density can be improved by trace addition of transition metal salts, such as Fe ones. NaNO3 is a low-cost salt, which had been used as etching agent to mechanochemically super-polish the surface of diamond as decomposed oxygen from NaNO3 can chemisorb on the surface of diamond and react with carbon to form CO and CO2 [19]. Inspired by this work, in this study, NaNO3 was introduced into the NaCl/ZnCl2 molten salt medium as surface etching agent to prepare N-doped carbon with open structure. A biomass waste, soybean dregs (SD), was selected as the carbon and nitrogen sources, which was carbonized at elevated temperature with NaCl/ZnCl2/NaNO3. The as-prepared opened N-doped carbons (ONC) were tested as electrocatalyst for ORR, and showed a comparable ORR activity to commercial Pt/C with outstanding durability. 2 Experimental The detailed procedure of preparing ONC is as follows: SD was first dried at 80°C in oven for 4days, and then the dried SD was sifted through a 80 mesh sieve to remove the large particles. 1g of dried SD was mixed with 10.5g of NaCl/ZnCl2/NaNO3 (mass ratio 60.16%, 35.08% and 4.76% respectively) mixture and ball milled in a zircon jar at 600rpm for 6h. After that, the mixture was loaded into a ceramic crucible and then located in an inert gas tube furnace. The temperature was elevated to 900°C with a heating rate of 2.5°C min−1 under nitrogen atmosphere, and kept at this temperature for 60 mins. Subsequently, the temperature was cooled down to 50°C with a cooling rate of 5°C min−1. The obtained product was immersed into 400ml H2O and magnetically stirred for 6h, then filtered out and dried at 80°C in a vacuum oven for 12h. Afterwards, 1g of the above products with 1g of FeCl3 were dissolved in 5ml of water, dried at 60°C for 12h and then heated at 900°C for 1h. The obtained product was treated HNO3 to remove unstable Fe species. After acid-treatment, the sample was rise with water until pH of filtrate was neutral, and the dried at 60°C for 12h, at last labeled as ONC. For comparison, SD without above salt mixture was also carbonized with the same procedure of preparing ONC. The final product was labeled as NC. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were performed on Shimadzu XD–3A with CuKα radiation. The morphology of carbon samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Carl Zeiss Ultra Plus) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2000 FX). Specific surface area was determined by the nitrogen adsorption region of relative pressure from 0.05 to 0.25, and the total pore volume was measured at 0.99. The pore size distribution was obtained with density functional theory (DFT) method using the QSDFT model for slit shaped pores provided by Quantachrome data reduction software QuadraWin Version 2.02 [20]. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were generated with a PHI-5702 multifunctional X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Physical Electronics). The activities were performed using CHI650D (CH Instruments) with a glass carbon (GC) electrode of diameter 5mm as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference one. Each carbon suspension was prepared by making 2mg activated carbon dispersed in 0.4ml nafion/ethanol (0.25% Nafion) solution. After sonication for 20min, 10μl of the ink was applied onto the GC electrode, and then dried under room temperature. The geometric area of working electrode is about 0.196cm2, and the mass loading of each carbon materials as well as commercial 20wt% Pt/C is about 0.255mg cm−2. The Pt-loading on the ring electrode was 51μgPt cm−2. 3 Results and discussion SEM picture of ONC presented in Fig. 1a showed a very open morphology with very thin walls. For comparison, SEM of NC is shown in Fig. S1a, in which irregularly shaped blocks in the range of about one micron and even tens of microns with a compact structure are found. TEM was performed to investigate their detail structures (Fig. 1b and Fig. S1b). As shown in Fig. 1a and b, interconnected macroporous network with open structure are observed in ONC. Moreover, the walls of this structure were made up of thin carbon layers, especially in its TEM image, which shows thin amorphous carbon layers were found. Its high resolution in Fig. S2 reveals thicker walls (about three layers) surround pores. The thickness of ONC is less than 1.1nm. In the case of NC, a relatively compact structure was revealed in Fig. S1b. SEM and TEM images clearly display the open structure can be fabricated in ONC via this molten salt method at high temperature. Nitrogen isotherm was adopted to study the porous structures of as-prepared carbons (Fig. S1c). In the case of NC, its N2 isotherm exhibits a typical type I adsorption/desorption behavior with a small uptake at low relative pressure, indicating that there are small amount of micropores existed in NC [21]. The N2 isotherm of ONC belongs to a mixed type, namely type I at relative low pressure and type IV at relative intermediate to high pressure. An obvious uptake appeared in the initial part, which is the characteristic of micropores. At the relative intermediate and high pressure, a certain hysteresis slope was found in the isotherms, indicating there are mesoporous existed, and a rapid N2 uptake at relative high pressure implies the existence of macropores [22]. The pore size distribution of ONC and NC presented in Fig. S1b clearly shows coexistence of micropore and mesopore in the two samples, and the amount of micro and meso pores in ONC is higher than that of NC. A large amount of mesopores in the range of 2.3 to 5nm was formed in ONC which results from the etching of NaNO3 at high temperature. The BET specific surface area of ONC is 1893.5m2 g−1, which is about 21 times that of NC (89.6m2 g−1). Meanwhile, total pore volume of ONC was 1.708m3 g−1, larger than that of NC (0.096m3 g−1). The XRD patterns of ONC and NC (Fig. S3a) show two diffraction peaks at 2θ values of ca. 25° as well as 43°, which are quite similar to that of graphite [23], but the two peaks are broad, suggesting that the graphitization of the two samples is quite low. XPS was performed to study the surficial chemical state of the elements. In Fig. S3b, both NC and ONC contain C, N and O elements. Although there was little FeCl3 added in ONC preparation process, no obvious Fe signal has been detected, indicating its washing out thoroughly. Furthermore, the faint signal centered around 200.0eV for sample ONC should result from Cl 2p. While according to Table S1, there is no obvious Na auger signal. Even if there is any auger Zn signal, it will be overlapped by O signal. In Fig. S3c, there is no signal of Na or Zn. It can be concluded that ZnCl2 will be trapped in closed pore inside ONC if there is a trace amount of ZnCl2 existed. However, the effect of ZnCl2 on electrochemical performance can be neglected [24]. To investigate N elemental chemical state which play an important role in the catalytic activity of N-doped carbon, its fine spectra were also conducted. As shown in Fig. S3d, there are six types of nitrogen species on the surfaces of both samples, namely, pyridinic-N at 398.3eV, pyrrolic-N at 399.9eV, graphitic-N at 401.2eV, pyridinic N-oxide at 402.4eV, π-π* satellite at 404.8eV, and entrapped NOx at 406.3eV [25,26]. Detailed percentage of these N species in ONC and NC are illustrated in Fig. S3e. The percentage of graphitic-N and pyridinic N in ONC is much higher than that of NC. High amount of graphitic-N and pyridinic N has been proved to bring about lower over-potential for ORR [27], which could result in a better ORR performance. To investigate the electrochemical performance of as-prepared samples, cyclic voltammograms were carried out and presented in Fig. 2a. The CV curve of ONC showed a reversible, featureless and quasi-rectangular shape with wide voltammetirc response, corresponding to a behavior of electrochemical capacitors with high specific surface area, which is a typical characteristics of N-doped carbon operated in nitrogen-saturated KOH electrolyte [12]. The ORR activity of as-prepared samples was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and benchmarked against the state of the art commercial Pt/C (Fig. 2b). LSVs of ONC and Pt/C catalysts show a sharp increase and rapidly reach saturation, implying ORR on both samples involve the similar pathway. Meanwhile, the ONC electrocatalyst has bigger limiting current density for ORR than commercial Pt/C. The onset potential (E onset) and half-wave potential (E 1/2) of NC are 0.905 and 0.699V respectively. In the case of ONC, E onset is 0.976V, comparable to 0.982V of Pt/C, and the E 1/2 is 0.886V which is a little higher than Pt/C (0.850V). In terms of E onset and E 1/2 for ORR, ONC is comparable to Pt/C. In Fig. S4a of obtained Tafel-plots, ONC has a well-definded Tafel slope of 81mV dec−1, revealing comparable kinetic characteristics and mechanisms to commercial Pt/C (93mVdec−1), while NC shows a sluggish value of 193mVdec−1. It was reported that macropores can act as buffer for storing electrolyte and facilitate mass diffusion, the mesopores can facilitate the ion transportation in porous materials and improve the ion diffusion kinetics, which could be the reason why ONC presents a high electrochemical performance [14]. The origin of ORR active sites was validated by adding SCN− ions into the electrolyte, since SCN− ions can strongly poison Fe-based active sites. As shown in Fig. 3 , there isn't obvious current change on NC and ONC after SCN− ions were added into the electrolyte, implying that the ORR active sites on the ONC surface weren't directly originated from Fe or Fe-N species, and could be resulted from the high surface area and synergetic effect between N and C elements on the surface. The ORR durability of ONC was benchmarked against the commercial Pt/C by continuous cyclic voltammetry scan for 10,000cycles. After 10,000cycles, their 1st and 10000th polarization curve were compared with each other and presented in Fig. 4 . For Pt/C, the E onset and E 1/2 negatively shifted by 16 and 15mV respectively after 10,000cycles, but the E onset and E 1/2 for ONC only shifted by 3 and 4mV respectively, which clearly prove that ONC is more durable than Pt/C. 4 Conclusions Opened N-doped carbon constituted by thin amorphous carbon layers with hierarchical porous structure were successfully prepared from biomass in a molten salt medium. The obtained ONC exhibits a high specific surface area of 1893.5m2 g−1 with major pore size distribution centered in the mesoporous range. Compared to commercial Pt/C, ONC shows comparable ORR activity and much better ORR durability. The high electrocatalytic performance of ONC results from its open structure which acts as buffer for storing electrolyte and facilitating mass diffusion, and hierarchically porous structure which facilitates the ion transportation and provides more active sites for catalysis.
