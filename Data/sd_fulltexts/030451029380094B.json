In particular the rate of alcohol synthesis is greater in the presence of water. Under the conditions used the effect is first noticable at 5 vol.-% water. At high conversion the effect is still observed but is not as significant. Key words: carbonyl complexes; cobalt; hydroformylation; olefins; tributylphosphine; water Introduction As a part of our investigation into the coordination and catalytic chemistry of sulfonated phosphines [ 1-3 ] we found it of interest to explore the effect of water on phosphine modified cobalt carbonyl catalysts for the hydroformylation of olefins. The reaction of highly basic sulfonated phosphines with Cot (CO) 8 under two-phase conditions initially yields only [ Co (CO) 3L2 ] [ CO (CO) 4 ] where L is a trisulfonated tris (cv-phenylalkyl) phosphine [ lb ] . The stability of these salts may be due to solvation of the cobalt ions by water. The inability to prepare disubstituted dimers in the presence of water may preclude the application of water soluble phosphines to cobalt carbonyl catalyzed hydroformylation. With this background we postulated that the presence of small amounts of water may also stabilize the formation of ionic compounds in phosphine modified cobalt carbonyl hydroformylation catalysts which are normally run under anhydrous conditions. Phosphine modified cobalt carbonyl catalysts typically employ simple trialkylphosphines, bicyclic or ditertiary phosphines which are sterically demanding and strong electron donors [ 4, 5 ] .

A literature survey suggests that the opposite behavior occurs. Specifically, an East German Patent reports that the addition of water accelerates the formation of alcohols in P [ (CHZ )11CH3 ] 3 modified cobalt carbonyl catalysts for the hydroformylation of C,,,-C,8 olefins [7]. We have confirmed this basic observation and report here an analysis of the effect of water on P (nBu) 3 modified cobalt carbonyl catalysts for the hydroformylation of 1-octene. Phosphine modified cobalt carbonyl hydroformylation catalysts typically yield alcohols rather than aldehydes. Since the initial reaction products from olefin hydroformylation are aldehydes this suggests that the cobalt carbonyl phosphine complexes are efficient hydrogenation catalysts. The reactions in Scheme 1 show the formation of linear aldehydes and alcohols from 1-octene. Experimental All manipulations were carried out under a prepurified argon or carbon monoxide atmosphere by standard Schlenk techniques. The solvents and reagents, toluene, 1-octene, nonane, were dried and deoxygenated by distillation under argon before use. Cot (CO) 8 was received from Strem Chemical Company. The reagents, P(nBu)3, 1-octene, nonane, the detergent, dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid sodium salt, were obtained from Aldrich. The CO/H2 (50/ 50) was received from Airco and used without further purification. The high pressure catalytic reactions were carried out in stainless steel 30 ml reaction vessels equipped with appropriate high pressure gauges that were purchased from Dibert Valve & Fitting. Reaction products and starting materials were determined by gas chromatography on a Varian 3300 chromatograph equipped with a HPl column 25 m X 0.32 mm X 0.52 jm, and FID detector; He was the carrier gas; the temperature program was from 50 C (3 min) to 200 C ( 5 min), at a heating rate of 10 C/min. The products were also identified by NMR (Broker WP 200) and GC-MS (VG 7070E-HF) spectroscopy. An OMEGA CN 2000 temperature process controller was used for the temperature control of the silicon oil bath. T. Bartik et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993)121-129 123 Catalytic reactions To ensure good reproducibility in the series of catalytic reaction separate stock solutions of P(nBu)3, 0.20 M, and Co2(CO)8, 0.05 M, were prepared in toluene and stored under Ar and CO respectively. The components of the catalytic reactions were combined at room temperature in a small reactor under CO. Nonane, 0.34 ml, was added as an internal standard for the GC analysis. The reaction vessel was closed, pressurized with CO/H2, checked for leaks, then placed in a silicon oil bath preheated to the reaction temperature, 190 C. In all reactions the stirring rate was kept at the same value. The pressure at reaction temperature was 800 psig. After the appropriate reaction time the reactor was removed from the oil bath, cooled to room temperature and depressurized. The products were immediately analyzed by gas chromatography. To facilitate mixing of the aqueous and nonaqueous phases 0.5% by weight dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid sodium salt was added to each reaction mixture, including those without water for consistency. In a separate series of experiments the surfactant concentration was varied from 0.5 to 10% by weight with no effect on product yields or selectivity. For clarification of the Figures the following quantities of water and the corresponding vol.-% water were used; 10 #1, 0.55%; 30 #1,1.63%;100,ul, 5.23%; 300 #1, 14.21%; 3000 #1, 62.37%. For the reactions in neat octene-1 the stock solutions were prepared in1octene. Total 1-octene was 0.60 ml and 0.5% by weight dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid sodium salt was added. The water amounts were: 10,u1,1.64%; 30 #1, 4.76%; 100 #1, 14.78%; 300 #1, 33.33% . Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the formation of alcohol and aldehyde as a function of time in the hydroformylation of 1-octene with Cot (CO) 8/6P (nBu) 3 in the absence (Fig. lA) and presence (Fig. 1B) of water. Water is present as a bulk second phase comprising 62 vol.-% of the total liquids at the beginning of the reaction. The reaction profile clearly shows that alcohol formation occurs at a faster rate in the presence of water and total alcohol formation in the batch reaction is dramatically increased. The octene fraction shown in Fig. 1 and in the subsequent figures represents all the isomeric octenes. The exact composition of the octene fraction varies with reaction time; at longer times increasing amounts of internal olefins are observed. The relative amount of alcohol and aldehyde formed is slightly influenced by the P : Co ratio. GC traces in the C8 region after 15 h show five peaks and GC-mass spectroscopy identifies each of these as an octene (i.e. a molecular ion is observed at 112 m/e ). If octane is present it must represent less than 5% of the total C8 hydrocarbons. In Fig. 1B the effect of the P : Co ratio is shown on the right at 15 h (the plot is shown perpendicular to the x and y axes). Maximum activity for alcohols was observed at a P : Co 124 T.

At approximately 5 vol.-% water, alcohol production increases at the expense of aldehyde also the total conversion of octene increases. At water contents of greater than 14 vol.-% (log vol.- 1.14) the production of alcohol remains roughly the same. The total cobalt concentration in the organic phase is kept constant in this series.

The data from Figs. 1 and 2, along with data at other water concentrations and reaction times, allows the construction of a three-dimensional plot of time, log (vol.-% H20) and product formation. These data are shown in Figs. 3A and 3B. At 15 h alcohol production (Fig. 3A) is at a maximum with a water concentration between 5 and 14 vol.-%. Aldehyde production (Fig. 3B) continuously decreases as the vol.-% water is increased. Fig. 4 shows the 1-octene consumption as a function of time and log (vol.-% H20) for the same series of reactions. In all reactions the predominant product is aldehyde at low conversion. Water, however, affects the rate at which alcohol appears in the reaction mixture. At 20% 1-octene conversion in the absence of water the product distribution is > 19% aldehyde and < 1% alcohol. In the presence of a bulk .water phase the distribution is 16% aldehyde and 4% alcohol at 20% conversion. Alcohol continues to be formed at a faster rate in the presence of water as the reaction proceeds. Thus at 50% conversion the alcohol-to-aldehyde distribution is 35% alcohol and 15% aldehyde at less than 5 vol.-% water, while at 14.2 vol.-% water the selectivity increases to 45% alcohol and 5% aldehyde. Water significantly affects the overall reaction kinetics. This is seen in the fact that the necessary reaction time to reach 50% conversion is shortened with added water. For example, under the reaction conditions used in the absence of water > 11 h is required to reach 50% conversion, while in the presence of a bulk water phase 50% conversion is reached in < 6 h. From Figs. 3A, 3B, and 4 at 15 h reaction time there is an optimum water 126 T. Bartik et al. /J. Mol.

Thus between 5 and 14 vol.-% water 1-octene conversion is greatest and the yield of alcohols is maximized. The reactions above were performed in toluene as a solvent with nonane as an internal standard. It is likely that the effect of water on the product distribution is solvent dependent and may reflect the solubility of water in a given reaction medium. Commercial phosphine-modified cobalt carbonyl catalysts are typically run without the addition of cosolvents. Thus a series of batch reactions were carried out in neat 1-octene as a function of added water for 3.5 h. The results are shown in Fig. 5. Added water clearly increases the rate of alcohol production in neat 1-octene as well. In this case the increased T. Bartik et al. / J. Mol.

The addition of water has a minimal effect on the regioselectivity of the overall reaction. For the reactions in toluene in the presence of > 5 vol.-% water and at a P : Co ratio of 3 :1, the n/b ratios of aldehyde products were consistently in the range 2.5-3.5 while the alcohol ratios were somewhat higher, 128 T. Bartik et al. /J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993)121-129 typically in the range 4.5-5.5. In neat 1-octene as the solvent the observed n/b ratios are smaller. These are given in Fig. 5. The values are approximate due to overlap of GC peaks in the alcohol region; however, there is a clear trend toward higher n/b ratios with increasing water. Hydroformylation experiments were also performed in the presence of water without added phosphine. The experimental conditions were similar to those above with phosphine, i.e. 190 C, 800 psig at an 1-octene : cobalt ratio of 500 :1. In a typical reaction with Cot (CO) 8 and no added water 95% conversion to products was observed in 15 h. At this temperature and pressure the distribution of hydroformylation products was 50% aldehyde and 45% alcohol. Under the same conditions, but with added water as a bulk second phase, 10% conversion to aldehydes was observed and no alcohol products were detected. Water deactivates the unmodified cobalt carbonyl catalyst. Several explanations can be proposed to account for the increased rate of alcohol synthesis and the overall greater selectivity towards alcohol in the reactions with added water. (i) Different species may be responsible for alcohol and aldehyde formation and water may increase the concentration of the complex responsible for alcohol synthesis. (ii) Water is directly involved in the reaction mechanism for alcohol synthesis, perhaps through the water-gas shift reaction. (iii) Water could be responsible for the formation of a new catalytic species which has a higher activity for alcohol formation. The new species may involve direct coordination of water to cobalt. In situ infrared spectroscopy experiments are in progress to address the mechanistic questions raised by the observation of the water effect on phosphine modified cobalt carbonyl catalysts. Conclusions Water clearly has a remarkable effect on the alcohol/aldehyde distribution and the reaction rate in tributylphosphine-modified cobalt catalysis of the hydroformylation reaction. The alcohol/aldehyde selectivity, as noted elsewhere, is also dependent on the phosphine used to modify cobalt [4]. Water, in fact may have little affect on cobalt catalysts modified by more sterically demanding and basic phosphines such as bicyclic alkyl phosphines as these already give improved reaction selectivity.
