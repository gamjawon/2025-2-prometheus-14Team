The photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction has emerged as a promising technology for the effective use of solar energy and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. MIL-100(Fe), as a MOF material, is always considered an excellent catalyst due to its excellent porous structure, low toxicity, extraordinarily high chemical stability and abundant active sites. However, the relationship between morphology and photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction is still being explored and studied. Here, we prepared the MIL-100(Fe) catalysts with different morphologies of nanospheres, nanoparticles and bulk to investigate their photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction performance. The results showed that the nanospherical sample exhibited the highest activity for photothermal CO2 reduction by H2O with CO productivity of 124.04 μmol·g-1·h-1 higher than the other two samples. The characterization results and mechanism analysis indicated that the nanospherical sample had a lower band gap energy value, lower luminescence intensity and stronger transient photocurrent response, which effectively promoted the separation of photo generated electron-hole pairs. More importantly, the AQE calculation results indicated that the nanospherical sample exhibited more lower activation energy in the presence of both light and heat, which is beneficial for photothermal CO2 catalytic to CO. This interesting find will provide experimental evidence for studying the morphology effect on photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction process.

Introduction Carbon dioxide as the most abundant C1 resource in nature, and converting it into high-value chemicals has always been a research hotpot. The CO2 conversion must overcome this high-energy obstacle in order to dissociate the C=O bond [1–3] Consequently, the process of using solar energy to photocatalytic CO2 reduction is considered as one of the most promising pathways. However, the lower photocatalytic efficiency restricts its industrial application. Recently, the photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction into useful chemicals or fuels attracted a lot of attention due to its excellent combination of the advantages of photocatalysts and thermal catalysis [4–6]. The above reaction system successfully introduce heat into the photo reactor to accelerate molecular diffusion, trigger and promote electron-hole separation, and increase solar energy utilization. Ultimately, the photothermal catalytic synergistic and efficient conversion of CO2 was achieved under relatively mild conditions [7–9]. The photothermal catalysts play a very important role in this reaction process with the requirements of adequate electron-hole separation, efficient solar thermal stability and abundant exposed active sites. However, the current catalysts still suffer from low solar energy utilization, carrier separation and poor thermal stability, which limited the catalytic conversion efficiency of CO2 [10–13]. MOF materials not only have excellent properties such as large specific surface area, high porosity, and porous supercharge structure, but also exhibit strong redox activity and good visible light response, which have been successfully applied in the fields of gas adsorption, energy storage, separation, and catalysis [14–18]. Some scholars from both domestic and international have also carried out relevant research focused on the effect of morphology modulation on catalytic performance from the material's own characteristics [19–22].

[23] investigated the catalytic performance of different shaped carriers for the catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides by adjusting the hydrothermal time to modulate the morphology of 3D TiO2 carriers. Wang et al. [24] synthesized four different morphologies of graphite g-C3N4 to explore their photocatalytic degradation performance of organic dyes. M. Salimi et al. [25] prepared molybdenum disulfide samples in the form of nanoflowers and nanosheets, respectively, by using one-pot method to study their photothermal properties. Łuczak et al. [26] reviewed the studies on the factors affecting the synthesis of different forms of MOF materials and the mechanism of the synthesis methods. In particular, a porous MOF material with trivalent iron as the metal center, MIL-100(Fe), was first synthesized by Professor Ferey's group at the University of Versailles, France [27]. The diversity of its own structure and good thermodynamic stability provides opportunities and ideas to study the reduction of CO2 by morphology. At present, although different morphologies of catalysts and their catalytic performance have been systematically studied. However, the morphology effect of MIL-100(Fe) catalyst on photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction has very few reports. In this work, three different morphologies of MIL-100(Fe) catalysts in the form of nanospheres, nanoparticles and bulk were successfully prepared, as detailed in the Supporting Information. Their physical and chemical properties were characterized by using instrumental analytical techniques such as FTIR, SEM, TEM, PL, etc. The catalytic performance was evaluated through photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction by H2O without any other additives, which showed that the nanospherical sample exhibited superior catalytic properties than the other two samples. Furthermore, a possible reaction mechanism for photothermal reduction of CO2 to CO was proposed. Results and discussion The MIL-100(Fe) catalysts with three different morphologies were synthesized by using the water bath method with different solvents, as shown in Fig. 1 a. The diffraction peaks for the three samples were performed by the XRD patterns analysis, as shown in Fig. 1b. The characteristic diffraction peaks can be clearly observed at 2θ = 10.28° and 11.13° for all the samples, which were in general agreement with the trend of the standard simulated diffraction peaks and coincided with the literature [28]. The above XRD results indicated that the successfully synthesized three samples belonged to the crystal structure of MIL-100(Fe). Moreover, the spherical sample exhibits better crystallization with sharper characteristic peaks compared with that of nanoparticle and bulk samples, which may affect the catalytic performance. FTIR spectrum was performed to investigate the surface chemical structure and functional groups of the prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 1c, the characteristic peak at 473 cm-1 is attributed to the Fe-O bonds, further confirming the formation of MIL-100(Fe) between Fe-oxo cluster and the organic linker [29]. The peaks at 763 cm-1 and 713 cm-1 are ascribed to the CH stretching vibration in the benzene ring. The C=O stretching vibration at 1631 cm-1 can be also clearly identified. The peak at 1381 cm-1 corresponds to the CO, as shown in Table S2. In addition, the peak located at 1719 cm-1 is due to the stretching vibration of C=O in unreacted H3BTC, which is consistent with the result as reported in literature. Meanwhile, the intensity of the vibrational peaks of the nanospheres are significantly stronger than that of the other two shapes of catalysts, which may be due to the complete reaction of the nanospherical catalyst, and the corresponding characteristic peaks are not observed at 1719 cm-1. [30,31] The samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to analyze their morphology structures. The SEM and TEM characterization results of the MIL-100(Fe) catalyst is shown in Fig. 2 . It can be observed that the morphologies of the prepared samples include nanospheres, nanoparticles, and bulk structures, and the particle sizes were calculated separately by using Nano Measurer software. It was clearly seen from Fig. 2a, c that the sample presented a uniformly sized sphere with an average particle size of about 98 nm, regular shape and uniform size [32]. Fig. 2b, d showed that the obtained samples are unevenly sized, rough surface, irregular nanoparticles with an average particle size of about 168 nm. In Fig. 2c, d, the sample presented a bulk like structure with an average particle size of about 395 nm. The SEM and TEM figures showed that the nanospherical sample had smaller and more uniform particles, which was conducive to the exposure of active sites to further improve the catalytic reaction [33]. The specific surface area and pore structure parameters of the photocatalysts were determined by the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, as detailed in Supporting Information Figure S1 and Table S1. The nanospherical catalyst had a specific surface area of 42.13 m2 g-1, a larger pore volume than the other two catalysts, and a more smaller pore diameter. The larger specific surface area and porous structure facilitate the reactants to reach the catalytic site with less restrictions, and also increase active site density at the edge of the catalyst. The result corresponds to SEM and TEM. [34]. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were carried out to investigate the optical properties of the prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 3 a, all the samples had an optical absorption edge of about 400 nm. The nanospherical particles underwent a red shifted phenomenon compared to the other two samples. We have learned from the SEM and TEM results that the nanospherical sample had more smaller and uniform particle sizes, which was conducive to electron exciting under light irradiation, thereby exhibiting better light absorption intensity. In addition, the bandgap energy (Eg) can be obtained from the plot of (Ahv)2 versus the photon energy (hv), as shown in Fig. 3b. The band gaps of nanospheres, nanoparticles, and bulk samples are 2.76 eV, 2.78 eV, and 2.80 eV, respectively. Their band gap widths are narrower and more easily excited by visible light and hence exhibit good visible light absorption. [35,36]. Photoluminescence (PL) was used to evaluate the efficiency of interfacial photogenerated carrier and electron-hole separation. In Fig. 3c, we can see that all the samples were excited at 278 nm and produced an emission peak centered at 386 nm. The lower PL intensity reflects the higher separation efficiency of the photocarrier and the better photocatalytic activity. The above results showed that the nanospherical MIL-100(Fe) catalyst possessed lower luminescence intensity, indicating a low rate of photogenerated electron and hole recombination [37]. The photocurrent (IT) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are also considered two effective methods for verifying the efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole separation and charge transfer [38]. The electrochemical tests were conducted to study the transient photocurrent response of different samples under intermittent visible light irradiation (Fig. 3d). In general, a high photocurrent density corresponds to a high efficiency of photoelectron-hole pair separation. We find that the bulk and nanoparticle catalysts exhibited relatively weak transient photocurrent response under visible light. In contrast, the nanospherical one presented more stronger transient photocurrent response, which is consistent with PL spectra [39]. The results were further explained that different morphologies for the MIL-100(Fe) catalysts had an effect on charge separation. In addition, the electrochemical impedance, as shown in Fig. 3e, reflected the speed of electron transfer and the magnitude of resistance to electron transfer. A smaller diameter indicated lower resistance and a faster rate of electron transfer at the interface, suggesting more effective electron-hole separation efficiency [40,41]. Therefore, the nanospherical sample shows higher photocurrent density and minimal resistance, relatively high charge separation efficiency under visible light irradiation, and reduced photogenerated carrier recombination, which can improve the photocatalytic activity[42]. The electrochemical Mott-Schottky plots of three shaped catalysts with different frequencies were carried out to study the energy band structure of the catalysts, as shown in Fig. 4 a, b and c. The semiconductor is classified as an n-type, when the slope of the tangent line is positive [43]. The flat band potentials (Ef) of the three morphologies of MIL-100(Fe) catalysts were found to be −0.66 V, −0.64 V, and −0.63 V with respect to the NHE, respectively. It is usually accepted that the conduction band (CB) of n-type semiconductor is more negative (0.2 V) than the flat-band potential (Ef), which translates to a standard hydrogen level of −1.69 V. Combining the band gap energies, the electronic valence band (EVB) of the sample can be calculated by the formula EVB = ECB + Eg. The electronic conduction bands of the three catalysts were −0.59 V, −0.60 V, and −0.62 V with respect to NHE, accordingly. Consequently, the energy band structures of the VB and CB of the catalyst can be plotted as shown in Fig. 4d. The higher conduction band bottom position exhibits the stronger reduction ability of photogenerated electrons, and the lower valence band top position presents the stronger oxidation ability of photogenerated holes [44]. From the band structures, we also clearly find that the redox potentials of these samples were more negative than that of CO2 to CO (−0.53 V vs. NHE), suggesting it is feasible to convert CO2 to CO. These results demonstrate that the nanospherical sample will exhibit more excellent photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance due to more negative CB potential than that of the other two samples. The test of XPS for the nanospherical sample was carried out to investigate the chemical elemental composition. As can be seen from the full spectrum in Fig. 5 a, the prepared catalyst contains three elements, C, O and Fe. In Fig. 5b, two characteristic peaks at binding energies of 284.8 eV and 288.45 eV are shown in the C 1 s spectrum, corresponding to the CC and C=O groups in the nanospherical catalyst MIL-100(Fe), respectively [45]. The two peaks with binding energies of 531.44 eV and 533.15 eV in the O 1 s spectrum of Fig. 5c is according to the Fe-O and C=O groups, respectively. The XPS spectrum of Fe 2p is shown in Fig. 5d, from which three characteristic peaks with binding energies of 710.90 eV, 716.72 eV and 725.15 eV can be obtained, corresponding to the Fe3+ 2p3/2 and Fe3+ 2p1/2, and the satellite peak of Fe3+ 2p. This result shows that Fe is present in the form of trivalent (Fe3+) in MIL-100(Fe), being consistent with XRD and FTIR characterizations [46,47]. The photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction under the same conditions was used to investigate the catalytic performance. Meanwhile, the quantum efficiency (AQE%) of the nanospherical catalyst for the production of CO under photothermal reaction conditions at 200 °C was calculated, yielding AQE% = 0.31 % [48]. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the nanospherical sample exhibits the best photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction with a CO yield reaching 124.04 μmol·g⁻¹·h⁻¹, which is about three times higher than that of the nanoparticle and bulk catalysts. This indicates that the morphology has a significant impact on the photothermal CO2 reduction [49]. We can clearly observe that the formation of photo induced charge carriers was not sufficient to convert more CO2 into CO. On the contrary, the CO yield was more higher in the presence of both light and heat. The supplementation of heat can activate the stable CO2 molecules, promoting their activation. At the same time, the temperature on the catalyst surface increased, which was beneficial for improving the reduction efficiency of CO2 adsorbed on the catalyst surface. To study the effect of reaction temperature, the catalyst experiment was also tested at 120, 140, 160, 180, and 200 °C with keeping the same light irradiation, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6c. As the reaction temperature increased from 120 °C to 200 °C, the CO yield gradually increased from 1.60 μmol·g-1·h-1 to 124.04 μmol·g-1·h-1, which confirms that the reaction temperature has a significant effect on the catalytic activity during photothermal catalytic reduction of CO2. This result demonstrates that the reaction temperature plays a key role in the reduction of CO2 under light irradiation. At the temperatures of 120 °C or lower, little photocatalytic reduction may occur because the electrons do not have enough energy to drive the CO2 reduction. In contrast, higher heat input favors the activation of reactant molecules (CO2 and water), thereby promoting the photocatalytic reaction [50]. Furthermore, the Arrhenius equation result showed that the activation energy (Light, Ea1 = 55.03 KJ/mol) under the action of light and heat was lower than that of the only heat (Dark, Ea2 = 58.62 KJ/mol) (Fig. 6d). Therefore, the CO2 conversion efficiency of photocatalytic reduction was greatly improved under the coupling of heat and light energy. [51]. In addition, in order to investigate the source of C in the product, the CO yield with no water, CO2, catalyst and normal reaction conditions were tested, respectively. From the results in Fig. S2, it can be seen that there is a significant difference in CO yield between the introduction and absence of CO2, indicating that the C source in the product of CO is mainly derived from CO2 [52]. To evaluate the stability of the nanospherical catalyst, a long-term CO production experiment was conducted under identical reaction conditions. As depicted in Fig. 6e, the CO yield exhibited a steady increase over a 6-hour period, demonstrating the catalyst's sustained activity. Furthermore, the MIL-100(Fe) nanospherical catalyst underwent three consecutive cycling experiments, as shown in Fig. 6f, revealing remarkable stability with a consistent CO yield of approximately 120 μmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹ across all cycles. To further elucidate the structural stability of the catalyst, XRD analysis was performed on the nanospherical sample before and after the reaction. The results presented in Fig. S3 indicated that the crystal structure remained virtually unchanged, confirming the robustness of the catalyst under reaction conditions. Additionally, thermostatically (TG) analysis was also carried out to assess the thermal stability of the catalyst. As illustrated in Fig. S4, the catalyst structure remained intact after the removal of adsorbed water molecules below 200 °C. These findings collectively underscore the excellent structural and thermal stability of the nanospherical catalyst. Based on above analysis results, a possible photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction mechanism based on the nanospherical MIL-100(Fe) catalyst was proposed (Fig. 7 ). Under visible light irradiation, the spherical structure of the catalyst facilitates enhanced photon absorption, leading to the generation of electron-hole pairs on its surface. Simultaneously, thermal energy promotes the rapid dissociation of water molecules into protons (H⁺) and accelerates the thermal motion of CO₂ molecules, thereby activating the adsorbed CO₂ on the catalyst surface. This results in the formation of activated *CO₂ and H⁺ species, which subsequently interact to generate the key intermediate formate (*CO₂ + H⁺ + e⁻ → *COOH). As the reaction progresses, *COOH undergoes further reduction through the transfer of additional protons and electrons (*COOH + H⁺ + e⁻ → *CO), ultimately yielding *CO. This intermediate then desorbs from the catalyst surface, releasing CO as the final product (*CO → CO). This stepwise mechanism highlights the synergistic role of photonic and thermal energy in driving the efficient reduction of CO₂ to CO. Conclusions In summary, this work reports three MIL-100(Fe) catalysts with different morphologies as an efficient and stable catalyst to study the morphology effect on the photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction. The experimental results showed that the CO yield of the nanospherical catalyst (124.04 μmol·g-1·h-1) was higher than that of the nanoparticle and bulk catalyst, which was about three times of their yields. The morphology has an important effect on its catalytic activity, on the one hand, this reason can be attributed to the nanospherical structure sample having a more dispersed and smaller particle size distribution, which supplied more CO2 adsorption and reaction sites. On the other hand, the nanospherical sample exhibited better light absorption ability, lower bandgap energy, and reduced fluorescence intensity, which promoted charge transfer and thus improved catalytic performance. Finally, the good performance of the nanospherical catalysts in the photothermal CO2 catalytic reaction was more verified by AQE and activation energy calculations. This work provides a new photothermal catalyst design idea as well as gives a possible orientation for developing efficient and stable catalyst based on MIL-100(Fe) for photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction effectively.

        "dc:description": "The photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction has emerged as a promising technology for the effective use of solar energy and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. MIL-100(Fe), as a MOF material, is always considered an excellent catalyst due to its excellent porous structure, low toxicity, extraordinarily high chemical stability and abundant active sites. However, the relationship between morphology and photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction is still being explored and studied. Here, we prepared the MIL-100(Fe) catalysts with different morphologies of nanospheres, nanoparticles and bulk to investigate their photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction performance. The results showed that the nanospherical sample exhibited the highest activity for photothermal CO2 reduction by H2O with CO productivity of 124.04 μmol·g-1·h-1 higher than the other two samples. The characterization results and mechanism analysis indicated that the nanospherical sample had a lower band gap energy value, lower luminescence intensity and stronger transient photocurrent response, which effectively promoted the separation of photo generated electron-hole pairs. More importantly, the AQE calculation results indicated that the nanospherical sample exhibited more lower activation energy in the presence of both light and heat, which is beneficial for photothermal CO2 catalytic to CO. This interesting find will provide experimental evidence for studying the morphology effect on photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction process.",
