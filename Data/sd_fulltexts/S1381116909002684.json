Graphical abstract Cobalt complexes bearing 2-(2-benzoxazolyl)-6-(1-(arylimino)-ethyl)pyridines, LCoCl2 (Co1–Co7) activated with MAO show good reactivity towards ethylene. Whereas at room temperature oligomerization was observed giving selectively alpha-olefins, at elevated temperatures polyethylenes were produced. A series of cobalt (II) complexes ligated by 2-(2-benzoxazolyl)-6-(1-(arylimino)ethyl)pyridines was synthesized and characterized by FT-IR spectroscopic and elemental analysis. The molecular structures of Co1 (Ar=2,6-Me2C6H3), Co2 (Ar=2,6-Et2C6H3) and Co7 (Ar=2,6-Br2C6H3) were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Compounds Co1 and Co2 display a distorted trigonal-bipyramidal geometry, whereas complex Co7 is a distorted square-pyramid. Upon activation with methylaluminoxane (MAO), all cobalt complexes showed reactivity towards ethylene. There was however an unexpected temperature dependence; whereas, at room temperature oligomerization was observed, giving 1-alkenes with high selectivities, at elevated temperatures polyethylene was produced. This unusual catalytic behavior of the new complexes was investigated in detail under various reaction parameters. Keywords Cobalt complexes Temperature switch catalyst Ethylene oligomerization Ethylene polymerization 1 Introduction Iron and cobalt complexes based on bis(arylimino)pyridines are known as highly active catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene [1–3], and such systems are currently the focus of much research [4–10]. Bianchini, Erker and others [11–17] have investigated unsymmetrical systems in which one of the arylimino groups was replaced by an alkyl or aryl substituent. Complexes of this type have recently been reviewed [18–25]. Cobalt catalysts have attracted less attention than their iron counterparts because in general they show lower activities. On the other hand, cobalt complexes of 2,9-bis(1-(arylimino)ethyl)phenanthrolines [26] and 2-methyl-2,4-bis(6-iminopyridin-2-yl)-1H-1,5-benzodiazepines [27,28] showed higher activities than their iron analogues. In line with the behavior of most polymerization catalysts, the molecular weights of the polyethylenes produced with these Co and Fe catalysts decrease with increasing reaction temperatures. Since good activities were found for metal complexes bearing 2-(benzimidazolyl)-6-(1-(arylimino)ethyl)pyridines [29–32], we decided to explore related 2-(2-benzoxazolyl)-6-(1-(arylimino)ethyl)pyridine ligands. Nickel complexes of these ligands show good to high catalytic activities for ethylene oligomerization [33,34]. On activation by MAO these cobalt catalysts showed an unusual temperature dependence, whereby at room temperature ethylene oligomerization took place, whereas at elevated temperatures polyethylenes were produced. We report here the syntheses and characterization of these cobalt complexes and their catalytic behavior in ethylene oligomerization and polymerization. 2 Experimental 2.1 General considerations All manipulations of air- and moisture-sensitive compounds were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques. The 2-(2-benzoxazolyl)-6-(1-(arylimino)ethyl)pyridines (L1–L7) were prepared according to our reported procedure [34]. Toluene was refluxed over sodium-benzophenone and distilled under argon prior to use. Methylaluminoxane (MAO, a 1.46M solution in toluene) and modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO, 1.93M in heptane, 3A) were purchased from Akzo Nobel Corporation. Diethylaluminum chloride (Et2AlCl, 1.7M in toluene) was purchased from Acros Chemicals. Other reagents were purchased from Aldrich or Acros Chemicals. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DMX 300MHz instrument at ambient temperature using TMS as an internal standard. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer System 2000 FT-IR spectrometer. Elemental analyses were carried out using an HPMOD 1106 microanalyzer. GC analyses were performed with a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 30m (0.25mm i.d., 0.25μm film thickness) CP-Sil 5 CB column. The yield of oligomers was calculated by referencing to the mass of the solvent on the basis of the prerequisite that the mass of each fraction was approximately proportional to its integrated areas in the GC trace. Selectivity for linear 1-alkenes was defined as (amount of linear 1-alkenes of all fractions)/(total amount of oligomer products) in percent. 2.2 Synthesis of cobalt complexes General procedure. A solution of CoCl2 in ethanol was added dropwise to a solution of the ligand in ethanol. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12h. The resulting precipitate was collected, washed with diethyl ether and dried in vacuum. All the complexes were prepared in high yield in this manner. 2.2.1 (E)-2,6-Dimethyl-N-(1-(6-(benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)pyridin-2-yl)ethylidene)benzeneamine CoCl2 (Co1) Obtained as green powder in 90.8% yield.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies were carried out on a Rigaku RAXIS Rapid IP diffractometer using graphite monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ =0.71073Å). Cell parameters were obtained by global refinement of the positions of all collected reflections. Intensities were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects and empirical absorption. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least squares on F 2. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. All hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions. Structure solution and refinement were performed by using the SHELXL-97 package [35]. Crystal data and processing parameters for Co1, Co2 and Co7 are summarized in Table 1 . 2.4 Oligomerization or/and polymerization of ethylene General procedure. Ethylene oligomerizations at 10atm ethylene pressures were carried out in a 500mL stainless steel autoclave equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a temperature controller. Toluene, the desired amount of cocatalyst, and a toluene solution of the catalytic precursor (the total volume was 100mL) were added to the reactor in this order under an ethylene atmosphere. When the desired reaction temperature was reached, the ethylene pressure was increased to 10atm, and maintained at this level by constant feeding of ethylene. After 30min, the reaction was stopped by cooling the reactor on an ice bath before the excess pressure was released. A small amount of the reaction solution was collected, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 5% aqueous hydrogen chloride, and then this mixture was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) to determine the distribution of oligomers obtained. The remaining reaction solution was quenched with HCl-acidified ethanol (5%), and the precipitated polyethylene was filtered, washed with ethanol, and dried under vacuum at 60°C to constant weight. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterization of cobalt complexes (Co1–Co7) A series of 2-(2-benzoxazolyl)-6-(1-(arylimino)-ethyl)pyridine (L1–L7) ligands was prepared following previously reported procedures [34]. The cobalt complexes Co1–Co7 were prepared by treating CoCl2 with one equiv. of L in ethanol at room temperature (Scheme 1 ). The products were collected by filtration, washed with diethyl ether and dried under vacuum. The complexes are air-stable powders which were characterized by FT-infrared spectroscopy. The elemental analyses confirmed the composition LCoCl2. The CN stretching frequencies of Co1–Co7 are shifted to lower values (1613–1616cm−1) compared to the free ligands. Single crystals of Co1, Co2 and Co7 were grown from their methanol solutions layered with diethyl ether. The molecular structures were determined by X-ray diffraction. Selected bond lengths and angles are collected in Table 2 . Fig. 1 shows the structures of Co1 and Co7; they differ mainly in the orientation of the CoCl2 moiety. Complexes Co1 and Co2 have essentially identical structures (for the ORTEP plot of Co2 see the Supporting Information). The coordination geometry around the cobalt center is a distorted trigonal bipyramid, in which the pyridine-nitrogen (N(1)) and two chlorine atoms form the equatorial plane, while the cobalt atom lies slightly out of the equatorial plane by 0.0356Å in Co1 and 0.0203Å in Co2. The axial positions are occupied by the other two nitrogen atoms N(2) and N(3). The N(2)–Co–N(3) moiety deviates significantly from linearity (Co1: N(2)–Co(1)–N(3) 147.28(1)°; Co2: 149.66(8)°). The equatorial planes of these two complexes are nearly perpendicular to the benzoxazole rings, with dihedral angles of 88.4° in Co1 and 83.7° in Co2. The 2,6-dimethylphenyl substituent lies almost orthogonally to the plane N(3)–N(1)–N(2) (91.7° in Co1 and 95.9° in Co2). Similar geometries are also observed in cobalt (II) complexes of 2-(benzimidazolyl)-6-iminopyridines [29,32], 2-imino-1,10-phenanthrolines [36,37], and 2-(benzimidazolyl)-1,10-phenanthrolines [38]. The steric effect of substituents at ortho-positions of the phenyl ring is reflected in the adjacent C–N bond lengths, i.e. the Co(1)–N(3) bond length of Co1 (2.198(3)Å) is noticeably shorter than that of Co2 (2.259(2)Å). The structure of Co7 is best described as a distorted square pyramid. The atoms N(1), N(2), N(3) and Cl(1) are almost coplanar, deviating only by 0.01Å. The cobalt atom deviates from the N(1)–N(2)–N(3) plane by 0.1448Å. The benzoxazole is almost coplanar with the pyridine ring, with a dihedral angle of 7.8°. The two Co–Cl bond lengths are substantially different, 2.3240(1) and 2.2523(1)Å, much larger than the bond length difference in Co1 and Co2 (0.02Å). Clearly the introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents in the ortho-positions of the phenyl rings has a pronounced effect on the structure, and this is also likely to affect the catalytic activities. 3.2 Reactions with ethylene With methylaluminoxane (MAO) as activator under 10atm of ethylene pressure, all the cobalt (II) complexes displayed moderate activities for the oligomerization of ethylene, with high selectivities for 1-alkenes (Table 3 ). Although MMAO or Et2AlCl could also be used as cocatalyst, they give lower activities (entries 2, 3 in Table 3), hence further investigations were carried out using MAO as the cocatalyst. As we had found previously with cobalt complexes of 2-(benzimidazolyl)-6-iminopyridines [29,32] and other ligands [28,37,38], Co1–Co7 only produced ethylene dimers and trimers without polymeric by-products at 20°C. The N-aryl substituents significantly affected the catalytic activities, and the ethylene oligomerization activities decreased in the order Co7 ≈ Co6 > Co1 > Co5 > Co2 > Co3 ≈ Co4. In general, electron-withdrawing substituents enhance catalyst activities, as do less bulky substituents. A possible explanation is that in late-transition metal catalytic systems, both bulkier and more electron-rich ligands weaken the interactions between the metal center and the incoming monomer and thereby retard the rate of ethylene insertion. The observed activity trends appear to be a superposition of electronic and steric factors. It is difficult to rationalize the steric influence of ligands; however, the electronic effects have been simulated and explained with the aid of computational studies that suggest a relationship of catalytic activity with the net charge of late-transition metal complexes [39–42]. The reaction parameters also affect the observed catalytic activities. For example, when the Al/Co molar ratio was increased from 200 to 1500, the activities of Co7/MAO initially increased and then decreased, with the optimum activity observed at an Al/Co molar ratio of 1000 (entry 4 in Table 4 ). Rather unexpectedly, increasing the reaction temperature led to the formation of polyethylene (Table 5 ). At 40°C under 10atm of ethylene, the catalysts Co1–Co5 solely produced polyethylenes, whereas Co6 and Co7 at 40°C gave variable amounts of oligomers as well as polymers. The polyethylenes have moderate molecular weights in the order of (17–34)×104 gmol−1. In all cases the polydispersities were rather broader than expected for single-site behavior. Increasing the ethylene pressure from 10 to 30atm over the temperature range of 40–60°C led to an increase in catalytic activities (compare Table 6 with Table 5), and with Co6 and Co7 especially, the polymer molecular weight also increase significantly (Table 6, entries 9 and 10). The origin of the change in catalytic behavior, i.e. formation of oligomers below 40°C and of polymers above this threshold temperature, is as yet unknown. One possibility was the alkylation of the ligand framework. It did not prove possible to recover the ligand from the actual polymerization reactions. However, the following experiment was employed to check stabilities of the complex in the presence of MAO. A mixture of Co3 with MAO (Al/Co=1000:1) was stirred at 60°C for 30min, followed by hydrolysis. From this mixture, the ligand 2,6-diisopropyl-N-(1-(6-(benzoxazol-2-yl)pyridin-2-yl)ethylidene)benzenamine was recovered in 76%, thus confirming that the ligand did not change on treatment with MAO or AlMe3. The catalytic activity of these cobalt systems is temperature dependent. The best activities were observed at 40°C. The activities decreased with increasing reaction temperature even under 30atm of ethylene, and at 70°C precursor Co1 had little activity. The most likely reason for this is more facile ligand transfer to Al and/or complex decomposition under such conditions. 4 Conclusion The cobalt complexes bearing the unsymmetrical ligand 2-(benzoxazolyl)-6-(1-(arylimino)ethyl)pyridine give improved catalytic activities compared with the analogous 2-(benzimidazolyl)-6-iminopyridine complexes [29,32]. An ethylene oligomerization productivity of up to 7.5×105 g(mol Co)−1 h−1 was found, with good selectivity for α-olefins. The activities increased with decreasing electron-donor strength of the ligands. However, increasing the reaction temperature to 40°C led unexpectedly to the formation of polyethylene, with about the same order of productivity. This catalytic system is thus behaving as a temperature-switch catalyst for the oligomerization and polymerization of ethylene.
