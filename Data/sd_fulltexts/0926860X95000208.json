The BET surface area of the catalyst decreased markedly after pretreatments with hydrogen, carbon monoxide and synthesis gas (HJCO 0.67 and 2). Calcined catalyst was in the form of c~-Fe20~, which was converted to either metallic iron (c~-Fe) or a mixture of c~-Fe and Fe304 after hydrogen reductions. During FT synthesis the a-Fe was carburized to iron carbides (x-carbide or e'-carbide) or oxidized to Fe304. After carbon monoxide or syngas pretreatments, the x-carbide was the most dominant phase. During FT synthesis this carbide was partially or completely converted to e'-carbide, Fe30+ and/or FeCO3. Hydrogen reductions resulted in stable or increasing catalyst activity with time on stream and the reduction conditions had a strong effect on the subsequent catalyst activity. The carbon monoxide and syngas pretreated catalysts deactivated with time. The hydrogen reduced cata- lysts produced more methane and gaseous hydrocarbons than the carbon monoxide or the syngas pretreated catalysts, and favored secondary hydrogenation and isomerization reactions.

Bukur et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 85-113 tation fuels via Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis at SASOL in South Africa [ 1 ]. However, the purpose ofpretreatment for iron FT catalysts is not clearly understood. Reduction in hydrogen may lead to a zero-valent state, but upon exposure to a synthesis gas the metallic iron is rapidly converted to a carbide phase or a mixture of iron carbides [ 1-4]. At high syngas conversions, a reaction mixture becomes more oxidizing and magnetite is also formed [ 1,5-7 ]. During FT synthesis (FTS), the bulk iron may be distributed among several phases: e.g. carbides, oxides and metallic iron, which often results in a lack of correlation between the catalyst bulk composition and its activity and/or selectivity [ 1,6]. Other pretreatments have been also employed, such as carbon monoxide activation, synthesis gas pretreat- ment or induction, and/or hydrogen reduction followed by carbon monoxide treat- ment or vice versa [5,8]. Also, there has been a large number of related studies on model iron catalysts dealing with an issue of the role of iron phases in FTS. However, this issue still remains to be a controversial one [ 7,9 ]. Briefly, some workers consider the surface carbides, with an underlying iron carbide bulk structure, to be the active phase [ 2,10]. In the so-called competition model of Niemantsverdriet and van der Kraan [ 11 ] iron atoms at the surface are considered as the active sites. In the latter model both bulk carbidation and FTS (hydrocarbon formation) have a common surface carbidic precursor. In addition to these two postulates concerning the nature of the active phase, Teichner and co-workers proposed that Fe304 is the active phase in FTS [12,13]. Validity of the latter proposal was questioned [14], but some evi- dence in its support was also presented [ 15-17]. An excellent summary of the early German work and studies at the US Bureau of Mines on pretreatment effect studies with promoted iron catalysts was provided by Anderson [5,6]. In studies with alkalized precipitated catalysts at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany it was found that reductions with hydrogen at rela- tively high temperatures were not effective, and further studies focused on pretreat- ments with carbon monoxide and carbon monoxide-rich synthesis gas. In studies with a precipitated iron catalyst (100 Fe/l0 Cu/0.5 K2CO3 in parts per weight) at the US Bureau of Mines, several activations were employed with different reducing agents: hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas (H2/CO = 1 or 2). It was found that catalysts activated with syngas or carbon monoxide had higher activity and produced less lower weight hydrocarbons than the hydrogen reduced catalysts. Used catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction and chemical analysis, but no correlation could be found between the carbide content of the used catalyst and activity or selectivity. These studies were conducted in a fixed bed reactor at a constant conversion, by increasing reaction temperature with time on stream, and thus reported product selectivities should be treated with caution. During the past ten years, there has been a renewed interest in the effect of activation (pretreatment) conditions on performance of promoted precipitated iron catalysts in fixed bed and slurry reactors under reaction conditions representative of industrial practice [ 15,18-25 ]. In Mobil's work on development of a two-stage D.B. Bukur et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 85-113 87 process for synthesis gas conversion to gasoline, pretreatments in a bubble column slurry reactor with synthesis gas (H2/CO) at 280, 1.1-1.5 MPa for 2-10 h often resulted in a satisfactory performance [ 18,19]. Studies at the US Department of Energy Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center were conducted in a stirred tank slurry reactor (STSR) with iron-manganese and iron catalysts promoted with copper and potassium [20-23]. In studies with pre- cipitated iron-manganese catalysts Pennline et al. [20] found that pretreatments with H2 or H2/CO = 1 syngas at 275 resulted in completely inactive catalysts during the synthesis. Activations with carbon monoxide were more successful, and changes in activation temperature or pressure had some effect on catalyst activity and selectivity. Zarochak and McDonald [21,22] employed activations with syngas (H2/CO=0.7 or 1) and carbon monoxide in studies with two (Fe/Cu/K20) catalysts. Following activation, catalysts deactivated with time on stream. Deacti- vation rate was affected both by pretreatment and reaction conditions during FTS. Researchers from Exxon [ 15] reported results from a study in which they com- pared performance of an iron oxide catalyst in the form of the spinel of Fe304 and a catalyst derived from this precursor by carburization with syngas (H2/CO = 1 ) at 350 for 24 h. After 60 h of FTS in a STSR both the iron oxide and iron carbide catalyst retained their original bulk phase identity, as determined by X-ray diffrac- tion. They found that carbided iron surface produces a more olefinic and higher molecular weight product than an oxide surface. This was attributed to higher acidity of the oxide surface. Davis and Tungate [24] studied pretreatment effects on a commercial sample of a high surface area ultrafine iron oxide (United Technologies, surface area 270 m2/g) in a STSR. Prior to the FTS the catalyst was pretreated with hydrogen, carbon monoxide or syngas (H2/CO= 1) at 260 for 24 h. It was found that activation with carbon monoxide resulted in activity which was three times higher than that of the hydrogen or syngas pretreated catalyst. After ten hours of FTS, methane and carbon dioxide selectivities were the same, regardless of the pretreat- ment procedure employed. Magnetite was the only iron phase found in the used catalyst samples withdrawn from the reactor after 10-48 h of synthesis. A comprehensive study of the effects of pretreatment conditions was conducted in our laboratory with a precipitated iron catalyst having nominal composition 100 Fe/3 Cu/0.2 K [25]. Following activation the catalysts were tested in a fixed bed reactor at: 250, 1.48 MPa, 2 N1/g cat/h and syngas feed with H2/CO = 1. Results from this study showed that activation parameters have significant effect on catalyst activity, stability (deactivation) and selectivity during FTS. Catalysts activated with carbon monoxide or syngas produced less gaseous hydrocarbons and more high molecular weight hydrocarbons (wax), than the hydrogen reduced catalysts. However, the carbon monoxide and syngas activations usually led to faster catalyst deactivation during FTS. Hydrogen reduced catalysts had a constant or gradually increasing FT activity during 120 h of testing. Activity of the hydrogen reduced catalysts was a strong function of pretreatment conditions (temperature, duration, 88 D.B. Bukur et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995)85 113 and flow rate), and decreased with either increase in reduction temperature or duration of reduction. Results from previous pretreatment effect studies clearly show that activation parameters may have a significant effect on subsequent catalyst activity, selectivity and stability. Conclusions drawn from pretreatment effect studies show some dis- crepancies, which is largely due to the use of different pretreatment conditions, and catalysts with different amounts of promoters. Here we report results from a pre- treatment effect study with a precipitated iron catalyst with nominal composition 100 Fe/0.3 Cu/0.8 K. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the trends observed in the study with the 100 Fe/3 Cu/0.2 K catalyst, are also valid for a catalyst containing different amounts of promoters and under different reaction conditions (syngas with hydrogen to carbon monoxide molar feed ratio of 0.67), and to gain a better understanding of pretreatment conditions on the catalyst per- formance through catalyst characterization studies. This particular choice of pro- moters (high potassium content) and reaction conditions (carbon monoxide rich syngas) is expected to favor production of high molecular weight hydrocarbons, and is representative of catalysts and process conditions suitable for processing of a coal derived synthesis gas. Pretreatment parameters investigated in the present study are: reductant type (hydrogen, carbon monoxide and syngas), temperature, duration and/or flow rate. Catalyst samples, before and after the pretreatment, were characterized by: BET surface area and pore size distribution, X-ray diffraction (XRD), M6ssbauer effect spectroscopy (MES), isothermal reduction and/or trans- mission electron microscopy. Catalyst samples withdrawn from the reactor after fixed bed reactor tests were characterized by XRD and MES to determine bulk phases in the working catalyst. Results from characterization studies are used to explain some of the observed activity/selectivity trends in reaction studies. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials, equipment and procedures The catalyst preparation involved two steps: preparation of the Fe-Cu precursor followed by potassium impregnation. The constant pH precipitation technique was used to prepare the Fe-Cu catalyst precursor as described elsewhere [25]. After potassium impregnation by incipient wetness technique the catalyst was vacuum dried and then calcined in air at 300 for 5 h. The powder so obtained was crushed and sieved to diameter between 0.25 to 0.50 mm (32/60 mesh). The catalyst composition was verified by atomic absorption using a Varian SpectrAA-30 spec- trophotometer. Catalysts (1.5-2.5 g) were pretreated in a SS-316 fixed bed reactor (1.25 cm OD, 12 cm long). At the end of pretreatment, the catalyst was purged with helium, D.B. Bukur et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 8~113 89 and the reactor was removed and transferred to a glove box without exposing the catalyst to an oxidizing atmosphere. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalyst samples before pre- treatment, after pretreatment, and after FT reaction (used catalysts) were obtained on a Geigerflex (Rigaku, Dmax Series) system using Cu-Kc~ radiation (A-- 1.54 ) starting from 2 0 = 2to 85at a rate of 4rain. For the determination of particle size by an X-ray line broadening (XRLB) method the region of interest was scanned at a lower rate of 0.5min. The instrumental line broadening was determined from NBS standard SRM-640 powder sample. The particle size was determined using standard Scherrer' s formula with K = 0.9 after applying the instrumental line broad- ening correction. The BET surface area and the pore size distribution of the catalysts before and after pretreatment were determined by N2 physisorption at 77 K using a Microm- eritics Digisorb 2600 system. The samples were degassed at 150 for 12 h prior to each measurement. Transmission electron micrographs of the catalysts were obtained using a Zeiss transmission electron microscope (model no. 10C). The particle size range was obtained directly from the micrographs by simple observation. The M6ssbauer measurements were conducted using a constant acceleration spectrometer of standard design [26,27]. The radioactive source consisted of 50- 100 mCi of 57Co in a Pd matrix. The samples were in powdered form and were mounted in plexiglas compression holders presenting a thin aspect to the gamma ray beam. Calibration spectra of metallic iron were obtained simultaneously at the other end of the drive. The spectra were analyzed by least-squares regression of a sum of Lorentzian lines to the experimental data. The hyperfine parameters, i.e. the isomer shift, the quadrupole splitting and the magnetic hyperfine field were obtained from the estimated line positions. Iron phases were identified by matching the observed values of the hyperfine parameters to those from literature. Isothermal reduction experiments with hydrogen and carbon monoxide at atmos- pheric pressure were carried out in a fixed bed reactor system similar to that used for FTS. The system was equipped with an on-line mass spectrometer (Dycor, M200; Ametek, Inc.) and a gas chromatograph (Carle, AGC Series 400). The effluent gases were monitored continuously by mass spectroscopy, at one minute intervals by the use of a computerized data acquisition system. Background cor- rection was employed for all the species of interest. For reaction studies about 3.0 to 3.5 g of calcined catalyst was diluted 1:8 by volume with glass beads of the same size range (32/60 mesh) and loaded into a fixed bed reactor. The operating procedures during the pretreatment and FTS were the same as those used in our study with the 100 Fe/3 Cu/0.2 K catalyst [25]. After achieving desired process conditions of 250, 1.48 MPa, 2.0 Nl/g cat/h and HJCO = 0.67, the catalyst was tested over a period of 100 to 150 h, during which two or three mass balances were made at approximately 70, 90 and 140 h on stream (including 30 h conditioning period). Tail (exit) gas composition was determined 90 D.B. Bukur et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (I995) 85113 frequently during the entire test, whereas the composition of liquid products (aque- ous phase, organic phase and hydrocarbon wax) was measured at the end of each mass balance period. Detailed description of our fixed bed reactor apparatus, prod- uct analysis system and operating procedures was provided elsewhere [25,28,29]. Total mass and individual atomic balance closures were normally within 100 _+ 3%. 2.2. Catalyst handling and sample preparation After each pretreatment procedure, the reactor was sealed (air-tight) in an inert gas atmosphere and then transferred to a glove box. The samples for XRD analyses were removed in an inert atmosphere and then transferred to specially designed sample holders made out of plexiglas. These sample holders could be sealed in the glove box and then placed directly in the X-ray machine. The BET sample tubes were also loaded in the glove box to prevent exposure of the catalyst to air. The used catalysts were removed from the fixed bed reactor under an inert atmosphere at the conclusion of the reaction tests. The sample handling procedure was similar to that described above. Catalyst samples removed from the top and bottom portions of the reactor were analyzed separately, after magnetic separation from the glass beads in the glove box. Such a separation was found to increase the intensity of the XRD peaks significantly. The TEM and MES measurements, however, were carried out in air at room temperature. The samples for TEM analysis were dispersed on the carbon film sample holder supported by 300 to 400 mesh specimen mounts. The probe was then mounted in the microscope and micrographs at several magnifications were obtained. 3. Results and discussion The composition of the catalyst determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy was found to be 100 Fe/0.33 Cu/0.84 K which is in excellent agreement with the nominal composition of the catalyst. 3.1. BET surface area and pore size distribution The BET-N2 surface areas of as-prepared, calcined, and reduced samples are listed in Table 1. The BET surface area was found to decrease after calcination from 190 to 130 m2/g. This is caused by the collapse of pore structure due to removal of water of hydration from the highly porous FeOOH/Fe203 structure. Fig. la shows the pore size distribution (PSD) of calcined sample. The distribution is fairly narrow with a maximum at approximately 6.5 nm. The average pore diameter calculated from measured values of the surface area and the pore volume are in good agreement with the pore diameter corresponding to the maximum in D.B, Bukur et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 85-113 91 Table 1 Summary of BET results of pretreated 100 Fe/0.3 Cu/0.8 K catalyst samples Run no.

L, Indicates the phase used for particle size determination. The particle sizes could not be estimated due to overlapping signals. the PSD curve (Table 1 ). After reductions with hydrogen at 250 and 280, the BET surface area decreased significantly (from 130 to 21 m2/g). It is known that as-prepared precipitated iron catalysts have high surface areas [ 1,6,30,31 ]. A majority of the area is due to a highly porous iron network formed from small iron oxide particle agglomerates (about 15 nm; see Table 2). The interparticle pores so formed are small in size and the network remains fairly stable after calcination at a relatively low temperature (300). On reduction, however, the porous structure collapses (in the absence of a suitable binder) resulting in sintering of iron particles. This increase in particle size translates into lower surface areas upon reduction. Similar trends have been reported by other researchers [ 1,6,30,31 ]. Fig. lb shows the PSD after pretreatment with hydrogen at 280 for 8 h. Although the PSD is fairly uniform (unimodal), the pore size corresponding to the maximum is considerably higher than that for the calcined catalyst. Similar results were obtained after reduction with hydrogen at 2500C (not shown). The position of maximum in the PSD shifted to higher values with increase in the reduction temperature (from 30 nm at 250 to 46 nm at 280). Values of the average pore diameter calculated from measured pore volumes and surface areas are close to those corresponding to the maximum of the PSD curves. The surface area after pretreatment with carbon monoxide or syngas also decreased significantly (Table 1 ). This may be attributed to particle sintering and collapse of the porous iron network as mentioned earlier. The pore volume decreased after pretreatments with the carbon monoxide and the syngas at 280, however, the pore volume of the catalyst pretreated with the syngas at 310 was the same as that of the calcined sample. The examination of the pore size distri- D.B. Bukur et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 85-113 93 butions of the catalyst after the treatment provides an explanation for this obser- vation. The pore diameter corresponding to the maximum in the PSD increased from 6.5 nm for the calcined catalyst to 13 nm after the carbon monoxide pretreatment (Fig. 1 c). However, upon pretreatment with the syngas at 310 the PSD became bimodal with two distinct peaks at 4 nm and 45 nm (Fig. ld). This suggests that after the pretreatment with syngas smaller pores are also created, in addition to the formation of larger pores. The higher pore volume observed after the syngas pre- treatment is due to the formation of smaller pores. XRD and MES analysis indicate the formation of x-carbide after pretreatments with the carbon monoxide and the syngas. It is possible that the carbide particle agglomerates have smaller pores whereas the large pores originate from the agglomerates of the oxide and/or bulk Fe particles. Also, it has been reported earlier that a carbon overlayer is formed on the surface of carbided catalysts [24,32-34]. This overlayer may be porous and posses fine pore structure. These small pores are probably responsible for higher pore volume after reduction with syngas. The surface areas after the carbon mon- oxide and syngas pretreatments are higher than after the hydrogen reductions (Table 1 ), which is also consistent with the postulate that a porous carbon overlayer is formed after carbon monoxide and syngas pretreatments. The data presented in Section 3.3 (Isothermal reduction experiments) lend support to this postulate. 3.2. Catalyst characterization by X-ray diffraction and MOssbauer spectroscopy As-prepared and calcined catalyst XRD patterns of both as-prepared and calcined samples were typical of cx-Fe203 (hematite, rhombohedral). The average particle sizes for the as-prepared and the calcined catalyst estimated by an X-ray line broadening (XRLB) method were nearly the same, 16 and 14 nm respectively, and are listed in Table 2. Reduced (pretreated) catalyst The phases identified in the pretreated catalyst samples by XRD are listed in Table 2, together with estimated particle sizes by XRLB method. After hydrogen reduction at 250 metallic iron (c~-Fe) was the only phase identified by both XRD (Table 2) and MES (Table 3). The particle size increased significantly after the reduction at 250 (from 14 to 24 nm) due to the sintering/agglomeration of the particles on reduction. This is consistent with the observed decrease in the catalyst total surface area. The XRD pattern obtained after hydrogen reduction at 280 for 8 h showed the existence of Fe304 and Fe phases. Relative amounts of these two phases, determined by M6ssbauer spectroscopy, were: c~-Fe (28%) and Fe304 (72%). It is important to note that in spite of higher reduction temperature and longer duration of the reduction than in the previous case, the reduction to a zero-valent iron was incom- plete. The flow rate used, however, was much lower than during hydrogen reduction 94 D.B.

It has been suggested that the water formed during reduction plays an important role in the determination of the iron phases formed [ 1,6,25 ]. At a higher reduction temperature, the water is released more rapidly and its partial pressure is higher than that occurring during reduction at a lower temperature. This, coupled with a low hydrogen flow rate, results in high water partial pressure during reduction at 280. At these high partial pressures of water, partial reoxidation of the iron phases may occur. The particle size of a-Fe estimated by XRLB method was greater than that obtained after reduction at 250 (33 vs. 24 nm). The dominant phase in the carbon monoxide and syngas pretreated catalyst samples was x-carbide (84-95%), the remainder being a superparamagnetic iron oxide or iron carbide phase (Table 3). An upper limit to the particle size can be obtained from the occurrence of superparamagnetism. For example the critical diameter of c~-Fe203 for superparamagnetic relaxation at room temperature is about 13.5 nm [35]. In our case, some iron particles are superparamagnetic indicating that the particle size is less than 13.5 nm. Low temperature measurements are needed to determine the exact nature of iron phases in these small particles. The particle sizes after pretreatments with carbon monoxide and/or syngas could not be estimated by the XRLB method due to overlapping signals of the X-carbide. It is interesting to note that all the carbon monoxide or syngas pretreatment procedures result in formation of the X-carbide regardless of the temperature, flow rate, or composition of the reducing gas. This suggests that the carburization of the iron phases is fast and may not be a strong function of the initial phase of iron. It has been reported that the use of promoters like Cu and K enhances the rate of carbu- rization of precipitated iron catalysts [ 36]. Used catalyst samples -- hydrogen reduced catalysts The results of MES and XRD analyses of used catalyst samples from a fixed bed reactor after FTS are summarized in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.

Fe~C denotes iron carbide phase(s). hydrogen at 250 (FB-0403), from the top part of the reactor (gas feed inlet) consisted of a mixture of metallic iron and iron carbide phases. In the bottom part (reactor outlet), however, iron carbides (FexC) were the most dominant phase detected along with weak signals corresponding to Fe304 (Table 4). Here, FexC designates either a single iron carbide phase or a mixture of two iron carbide phases (X or E' ). The precise identification of these two types of carbides is rather difficult when the signal intensities are low, and other compounds with overlapping peaks are present (Fe304, wax). In this paper x-carbide (FesC2) refers to the so called Hfigg carbide [ 37 ]. Designation e'-carbide (Fez2C) is used to describe a pseudo- hexagonal iron carbide, which is also referred to as E-Fe2C carbide [38]. The particle size estimated by XRLB method for samples from the top and bottom parts of the reactor is listed in Table 4. The crystallite size of the used catalyst ( 19-23 nm) is similar to that of the reduced catalyst (24 nm). The nature of iron carbide phases was determined by MES (Table 3). The dominant iron phase in the sample from the top is x-carbide (64%), a-Fe and an iron phase exhibiting superparamagnetic properties being the remainder. The e'- carbide is the dominant phase (71%) in the bottom part of the reactor. The amount of x-carbide, however, decreased from the top part of the reactor to the bottom part of the reactor from 64 to 7%, respectively. The MES results confirmed the presence of Fe304 (14%) in the sample from the bottom part of the reactor. The catalyst used in run FB-0403 was completely reduced to metallic iron prior to FTS (Table 3), whereas in the presence of carbon monoxide under FTS condi- tions iron carbides were the dominant phase. This is consistent with the trend observed earlier when the catalyst was pretreated with syngas, and suggests that the rate of carburization of Fe and/or oxides is higher than that of reduction of oxides to metallic Fe. The presence of Fe304 in the used catalyst has been reported earlier in the literature [ 1,6,24,39]. It has been suggested that water vapor formed during FTS is responsible for the reoxidation of Fe/FexC to Fe304 [ 1,6]. 96 D.B. Bukur et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (19951 85 113 The effective H2/CO ratios are different in different parts of the reactor. In addition, due to the water and carbon dioxide formed during FTS, H20/H2 and CO2/CO ratios are higher in the bottom part than in the top part of the reactor. This results in a reducing environment in the top part of the reactor, and an oxidizing environment in the bottom part of the reactor [ 15 ]. Thus the nature of iron phases as well as their relative amounts may vary along the reactor due to the presence of redox gradients, which was observed in the present study and in the one by Soled et al. [15]. XRD analysis of the used catalyst, pretreated with hydrogen at 280, from both top and bottom parts of the reactor revealed the presence of Fe~C phase (s) ( Table 4). The particle size of the carbide(s) could not be obtained due to overlapping signals. Two carbide phases (x-carbide and E'-carbide) were dominant (93%) in the sample from the top of the reactor, the remainder being a superparamagnetic phase. The relative amount of E'-carbide increased from 57% in the top part of the reactor to 95% in the bottom part, whereas that of x-carbide decreased from 36% in the top part to 5% in the bottom part of the reactor (Table 3). The XRD and MES results for hydrogen pretreated catalyst indicate significant carbiding under FTS conditions. The relative amounts of iron carbides present vary with position along the reactor. Raupp and Delgass [3] found that the type of carbide formed was dependent on the particle size of the iron phase. Larger iron particles tend to form x-carbide, whereas smaller iron particles form a less stable d-carbide. Our results show that the gas composition in the reactor has a strong influence on the stability and/or formation of iron carbides in the reactor. Used catalyst samples -- carbon monoxide and syngas pretreated catalysts The iron phases identified by MES and XRD analysis in used catalysts pretreated with carbon monoxide or syngas are also listed in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. The phases found in the used catalyst samples were: Fe,C ( d-carbide and x-carbide), Fe304, FeCO3 (siderite) and small amounts of superparamagnetic iron phases. The particle size of the Fe~O4 phase estimated by XRLB method was 31-33 nm (runs FB-0021 and FB-0352), and that of siderite: 42 nm (run FB-0942). The presence of siderite in used precipitated iron catalysts has been rarely reported [6]. It is possible that carbon dioxide formed by the water-gas shift reaction plays a role in the formation of siderite. Small amounts of siderite were found in the used catalyst from run FB-0021 (carbon monoxide pretreated catalyst), whereas the siderite was the only phase detected in the sample from run FB-0942 (bottom part of the reactor). Fig. 2a shows the M6ssbauer spectrum of the latter sample, which is characterized by a doublet with an isomer shift of 1.21 mm/s corresponding to siderite, whereas its XRD spectra is shown in Fig. 2b together with an identification pattern of the siderite. It is interesting to note that )(-carbide was not found in any of the three samples from the bottom part of the reactor, even though it was the dominant phase after pretreatments with the carbon monoxide and syngas (84-95%).

The mechanism for a phase transformation from x-carbide to E'-carbide is not clear, but it may occur through oxidation of the former followed by carburization of an intermediate iron oxide phase to E'-carbide. The E'-carbide is stable at the reaction temperature of 250, and appears to be more resistant to an oxidizing environment than the x-carbide. On the other hand the x-carbide retains its stability in the reducing atmosphere near the reactor inlet (Table 3, the syngas pretreated catalysts from the top portion of the reactor). These observations on relative stability of the x-carbide and the e'-carbide phases in different redox environments are consistent with results obtained from two tests with the hydrogen reduced catalysts. 3.3. Isothermal reduction experiments Relative concentration profiles of reductant carbon monoxide and product carbon dioxide obtained during isothermal reduction at 280 are shown in Fig. 3a. The carbon dioxide profile shows a sharp peak at about 5 rain, followed by a broad maximum after about 40 rain of reduction. This means that the rate of reduction of the catalyst is very rapid initially (up to 10 min). This peak is probably due to the reduction of FezO3 to Fe304 and CuO to Cu. The second broad peak is due to the reduction of Fe304 to Fe and further carburization to iron carbides. The rate of reduction, as indicated by the formation of carbon dioxide, gradually decreased after 150 rain. However, a small amount of carbon dioxide was detected even after 8 h of reduction. The amount of carbon dioxide formed during reduction up to about 8 h was obtained from the carbon dioxide concentration profile shown in Fig. 3a. For this purpose, the data obtained by mass spectrometry were converted into absolute molar flow rates of carbon dioxide, after calibration of the mass spectrometer using several known concentration values obtained by gas chromatography and the total effluent flow rate. Integration of the carbon dioxide molar flow rate profile yielded the total amount of carbon dioxide formed during 8 h of reduction as 47 mmol/g of catalyst. The total amount of carbon dioxide expected from complete reduction of the catalyst is 18.7 mmol/g, whereas the total amount of carbon dioxide that can be formed during the complete carburization of the catalyst (to Fe22C) is 5.6 mmol/g. This means that the total amount of carbon dioxide formed exceeds the amount of carbon dioxide that can be accounted for by both reduction as well as carburization. The excess carbon dioxide is presumably due to carbon monoxide disproportiation and formation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst. Isothermal reduction profile obtained during hydrogen reduction of the catalyst at 280 for 8 h, as seen by the formation of water, is illustrated in Fig. 3b. A sharp peak at about 10 rain of reduction indicates rapid initial reduction. However, the rate of reduction decreases gradually after about 30 min. Similar reduction behavior was observed with the 100 Fe/3 Cu/0.2 K catalyst during reduction with hydrogen D.B.

Quantitative information that could be obtained was limited due to lack of calibration methods for H20 observed by mass spectrometry. However, the weight loss due to reduction was estimated at about 25% of the total expected weight loss for reduction of Fe203 to Fe. This is in excellent agreement with the M6ssbauer spectroscopy results (Table 3). 3.4. Catalyst acttvi~ and stabili~ Catalyst activity, measured by volumetric gas contraction, as a function of tem- perature and time during the conditioning period is shown in Fig. 4. Volumetric contraction, defined as 100 (inlet flow rate-outlet flow rate)/inlet flow rate, is a convenient measure of catalyst activity, since it changes nearly linearly with syngas conversion. The gas contraction increases with temperature and reaches different values at the end of the conditioning period. Results during the conditioning period are indicative of initial catalyst activity. During the first ten hours on stream the data are scarce and erratic due to non uniformity of reactor temperature and fluc- tuations in outlet gas flow rate. At temperatures of 230 and above ( 10-30 h on stream) the activity of hydrogen reduced catalysts was lower than that of the carbon monoxide or syngas pretreated catalysts. Hydrogen reduction at 280 resulted in the lowest gas contraction (catalyst activity). Catalyst activity and stability, at the process conditions, as a function of time on stream (TOS) is shown in Fig. 5. The activity is represented by (H2 + CO) con- version (defined as mole of syngas consumed per mole of syngas fed). The catalyst exhibited similar activity behavior after pretreatments with carbon monoxide (280 for 8 h) or syngas (both H:/CO=0.7 at 280 for 8 h and H2/CO=2.0 D.B.

However, the catalyst deactivated with TOS, following a similar time-dependent behavior in all three cases. The (H2+CO) conversion decreased to about 55% at 150 h on stream. An apparent reaction rate constant can be also used as a measure of catalyst activity. The apparent reaction rate constant, based on the assumption that the reaction rate has a first-order dependence on hydrogen pressure, was estimated using a procedure described by Zimmerman et al. [28]. Numerical values of the apparent reaction rate constant for all five tests are listed in Table 5. Catalyst activity after reductions with hydrogen was clearly dependent on the reduction conditions employed (temperature, duration and flow rate). After the reduction at 250, flow rate 4000 cm3/min (which corresponds to a linear gas velocity of 150 cm/s) for 2 h, the initial (H2 + CO) conversion was 77%; whereas after the reduction at a higher temperature of 280, flow rate 175 cm3 / min (which corresponds to a gas space velocity of 3.0 N1/g cat/h) for 8 h the (H2+CO) conversion was only about 50%. During the FTS, the (H2+CO) conversion increased steadily with time reaching 85% (run FB-0403) and 58% (run FB-3221 ), respectively. Such time-dependent behavior is in contrast to that observed following the carbon monoxide or the syngas pretreatments. Water-gas shift (WGS) activity of the catalyst is related to hydrogen to carbon monoxide usage ratio (UR), and partial pressure quotient (Kp = PcozPH2/PcoPHzo). Lower values of the usage ratio, or higher values of the Kp imply higher WGS activity. In both tests, after the hydrogen reduction, the usage ratios were similar, about 0.60-0.61, and stable with time on stream (Table 5), For the catalyst pretreated with carbon monoxide and H2/CO = 2, the usage ratio was 0.61-0.64, whereas for the catalyst pretreated with syngas H2/CO = 0.7 the usage ratio was 0.59. In the latter three cases, even though the overall catalyst activity 102 D.B.

Hydrogen reduced catalyst had higher Kp values, than either the carbon monoxide or the syngas pretreated catalyst. In general, the pretreatment procedure had a small effect on WGS activity under the conditions studied. The effects of various pretreatment procedures on the catalyst activity and its stability with TOS may be summarized as follows: ( 1 ) after the carbon monoxide or syngas pretreatments, the catalyst achieved high initial activity, which then decreased with time on stream. Initial activities of the carbon monoxide and syngas pretreated catalysts were higher than those of hydrogen reduced catalysts; (2) after hydrogen reductions, catalyst activity was stable or gradually increased with time on stream. Activity of the catalyst reduced at 250 for 2 h was significantly higher than that of the catalyst reduced at 280 for 8 h; (3) the water-gas-shift activity was high after all pretreatments. It did not vary markedly with pretreatment con- ditions, although it was somewhat higher on the hydrogen reduced catalysts. Catalyst FT activity after carbon monoxide and syngas pretreatments The first two observations listed above are in agreement with results from our study with the 100 Fe/3 Cu/0.2 K catalyst [25]. Also, several research groups have reported that the carbon monoxide pretreated iron catalysts are more active than the hydrogen reduced catalysts [6,24], although in the latter studies the use D.B. Bukur et al. / Applied Catalysis A : General 126 (1995) 85 113 103 of relatively high reduction temperatures (260-313) and long durations may be responsible for this behavior, as discussed in the next section of the paper. After the pretreatment with carbon monoxide or syngas, the dominant phase was the H~igg carbide ( 84-95% ). Surface areas and pore volumes of the catalysts after these pretreatments were similar too. During the subsequent FTS, the catalyst activity, and selectivity were also similar. This represents a strong correlation between the catalytic behavior and the structural properties of the catalyst after the pretreatment. The observed decline in catalyst activity may be attributed in part to the conversion of H~igg carbide (the most active phase) to inactive (or less active) phases such as magnetite and/or siderite. Also, the catalyst deactivation with time may be partly due to blocking of active sites by carbonaceous deposits. In the FTS, carbon monoxide undergoes dissociative adsorption (chemisorption) on the cata- lyst surface, forming a highly active species [41,42]. The reactions of this surface carbon, C*, proceed competitively with iron and hydrogen, or with itself, leading to: ( 1 ) formation of surface metal carbide, and then bulk carbide by carbon diffu- sion; or (2) hydrogenation to methyl species ( synthesis of hydrocarbons) ; and ( 3 ) formation of inactive carbon [ ! 1 ]. The competition depends on the concentration of hydrogen on the catalyst surface [43]. Initial activity over substantially carbided catalyst (carbon monoxide or syngas pretreatment) is high, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. This indicates that the concentration of the surface carbon (formed from the synthesis gas) is high initially, and the dominant reaction is hydrogenation to form hydrocarbons since the bulk of the catalyst has been already carbided. A high synthesis rate implies that consumption of the surface hydrogen species is also high, and on the surface of carbided catalyst the abundant species is carbon rather than hydrogen. As a consequence of this, the rate of removal of surface carbon by hydrogenation is lower than the rate of carbon monoxide dissociation. Then, some of the C* forms a carbonaceous deposit, which eventually converts to an inactive (graphitic) carbon. This inactive carbon can further block hydrogen chemisorption sites, lowering surface hydrogen concentra- tion and leading to a decrease in the rate of FTS, i.e. to catalyst deactivation. Formation of inactive carbon deposits on the surface of iron based FT catalysts is considered to be the major cause of catalyst deactivation by some researchers [9,44,45]. The observation that the carbon monoxide or the syngas activated catalyst has higher initial activity than hydrogen reduced catalyst is consistent with the com- petition model of Niemantsverdriet and van der Kraan [ 11 ]. During the FTS, on a hydrogen reduced catalyst, some of the active surface carbon is consumed to form bulk carbides, and thus the rate of FTS is initially lower relative to the precarbided catalyst. In terms of bulk iron phases present after different pretreatments, these results could be interpreted as to imply that the Hfigg carbide is more active for FTS than the metallic iron and/or magnetite. It is important to note, however, that surface area differences may also contribute to differences in activity. The BET 104 D.B. Bukur et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 85-113 surface area of the carbon monoxide and syngas pretreated catalysts is higher than that of the hydrogen reduced catalysts by a factor of 2. Catalyst FT activity after hydrogen reductions Two different reduction procedures with hydrogen were employed and they led to different degrees of catalyst reduction and different levels of stable catalyst activity. After the reduction at 250, 4000 cm3/min for 2 h the catalyst was completely reduced to metallic iron and was active during the FTS. After the reduction at higher temperature (280, 175 cm3/min for 8 h) the reduction was incomplete (mostly magnetite: 72%) and the catalyst activity was lower. It is known that the water vapor inhibits the reduction of iron oxides in hydrogen. High flow rate of hydrogen during reduction decreases the water vapor pressure and facilitates the reduction. Surface area of the calcined catalyst was 130 m2/g, after hydrogen reduction at 250 and 280, it drops to only 21 m2/g in both cases, which indicates that sintering of Fe203 particles to Fe or Fe304, though very severe, is similar at two temperatures. Therefore, the difference in catalyst activity may be related to differences in the initial degree of iron reduction. Results show that completely reduced catalyst is more active for FTS. Used catalyst samples contain two types of iron carbides (X and e'), and a small fraction of iron is in the form of iron oxides or iron carbides which exhibit a superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature. The more active catalyst (hydrogen reduction at 250) also has some c~-Fe, whereas the less active catalyst does not contain metallic iron. In several studies with iron based catalysts it was reported that the catalyst activity increases with the degree of reduction [ 14,46,47]. In our study with the 100 Fe/3 Cu/0.2 K catalyst [25] four different hydrogen reduction procedures were employed, and it was found that the catalyst activity decreases with both the increase in reduction temperature (250 vs. 280) and duration of the reduction (8 vs. 24 h duration at 280) at a constant flow rate of hydrogen. For example, initial (H2 +CO) conversions after reductions at 250 for 8 h, and at 280 for 24 h were 65% and 30%, respectively, which is in a qualitative agreement with results obtained in the present study. Recently, pretreat- ment effect studies were conducted at Sandia National Laboratory on a sample of the 100 Fe/3 Cu/0.2 K catalyst, synthesized in our laboratory, by Auger electron spectroscopy [48]. In this study it was found that sulfur migrates from the bulk to the surface of the catalyst, during hydrogen reductions. The sulfur arises from bulk sulfate impurities present in the metal nitrates used to prepare the catalyst. Sulfur coverage increased with an increase in both reduction time and temperature, due to an increase in the rate of sulfur diffusion with temperature. Since sulfur is known to act as a poison for FTS, a catalyst reduced at a higher temperature and/or over a longer period of time is expected to have a lower FT activity, and this was observed in our studies with the 100 Fe/3 Cu/0.2 K and 100 Fe/0.3 Cu/0.8 K catalysts. A sulfate impurity level in the Fe (NO3) 3\" 9H20 (Baker, 99.9%) used to prepare these two catalysts is less than 0.006 wt.-%, which corresponds to about 85 ppm of sulfur D.B. Bukur et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 85-113 105 in the catalyst. Then, the maximum sulfur coverage on the 100 Fe/0.3 Cu/0.8 K catalyst with the BET surface area of 21 m2/g (after both hydrogen reductions), assuming that all of the iron is completely reduced and all of the sulfur migrates to the surface, is estimated to be on the order of 0.008 monolayers (ML). In the case of incompletely reduced catalyst (hydrogen reduction at 280 for 8 h) the maxi- mum sulfur coverage may be even higher if sulfur covers the metallic sites only. The activity, measured by the apparent reaction rate constant, of the hydrogen reduced catalyst at 280 was about 60% less than that of the hydrogen reduced catalyst at 250 for 2 h (Table 5). Wachs et al. [49] did observe ca. 0.03 ML of sulfur on a hydrogen activated 100 Fe/1.6 Cu catalyst, but suggest that this sulfur coverage is too low to be significant. Sault [48] calculated the maximum sulfur coverage for the 100 Fe/3 Cu/0.2 K catalyst (BET surface area of 5-10 m2/g) to be on the order of 0.04-0.09 ML, whereas the measured sulfur coverages from the Auger spectroscopy measurements were on the order of 0.07-0.18 ML. These coverages were considered high enough to cause a decrease in the FT activity with increase in reduction temperature and duration, observed in our study with this catalyst [ 25,48 ]. It is possible that sulfur migration to the catalyst surface, and/or poisoning by sulfur impurities in hydrogen gas, had played a significant role in a number of previous studies with iron catalysts. In the early work on FTS at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany with alkalized precipitated iron catalysts, it was found that reduction with hydrogen at 360 was not effective ( pp. 176-180 in [ 5 ] ). Pennline et al. [ 20] reported that pretreatments with hydrogen or HJCO = 1 syngas at 275 for 24 h resulted in completely inactive catalysts (precipitated iron-manganese catalyst 21 Fe/79 Mn) during the subsequent FTS. In studies at the US Bureau of Mines [6] with a precipitated iron catalyst ( 100 Fe/10 Cu/0.5 K2CO3) the activity of the catalysts which were reduced with hydrogen at 313 for 17 h (Test X-245 ), or at 296 for 25 h followed by carbon monoxide pretreatment at 185-300 for 13 h (Test X-324) was lower by a factor of 3-4 than the activity of the catalysts pretreated with H2/CO=2 at 310 for 6 h (Tests X-304 and 825). In a recent study with an ultrafine iron oxide [24], it was reported that the activity of the hydrogen and syngas (H2/CO = 1 ) pretreated catalysts at 260 for 24 h was lower by a factor of 3 than that of the carbon monoxide pretreated catalyst (under the same pretreatment and reaction conditions). In all these studies, which resulted in either no FT catalyst activity or low FT activity, there are some common features, Unsupported catalysts were used in all of them, and the surface areas after the hydrogen reductions are expected to be low ca. 5-40 m2/g (e.g. Anderson [6] reported the surface area of 6.3 m2/g after the reduction at 300 for 17 h). The catalysts were reduced at relatively high temperatures (260-360), and the reduc- tion time was relatively long ( 17-24 h). Based on the results from Sault's study with the 100 Fe/3 Cu/0.2 K catalyst the above conditions are conducive to sulfur segregation, and sulfur migration from the bulk to the catalyst surface may be the cause of low FT activity in these studies. 106 D.B. Bukur et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 85-113 It is interesting to note that in two of the above studies [ 20,24] a low FT activity was also observed after the syngas pretreatments, whereas this was not observed in our studies with the 100 Fe/3 Cu/0.2 K and 100 Fe/0.3 Cu/0.8 K catalysts, even though we employed higher pretreatment temperatures (280-310) which would tend to favor the sulfur migration. However, the duration of pretreatment in these two studies (24 h) was significantly longer than that used in our studies (6-8 h), and this could more than compensate for the use of lower temperatures. Also, the sulfur impurity levels in the catalysts and in the syngas employed in these two studies are not known. On the other hand, no adverse effects on the FT activity were observed in these two studies, as well as in our studies, after the carbon monoxide pretreatments at the same temperature and duration as those used during the hydrogen reductions and syngas pretreatments. This indicates that the affinity of hydrogen towards sulfur is much greater than that of the carbon monoxide. Also, the presence of different bulk phases, formed after different pretreatments, may have an effect on diffusion of sulfur from the bulk to the surface of the catalyst. When a catalyst reduced by hydrogen is exposed to a synthesis gas, the surface carbon species is formed which diffuses into the bulk to form bulk iron carbides. However, the catalyst can maintain a stable activity over a long period of time, in contrast to the precarbided catalyst (after carbon monoxide or syngas pretreat- merits). A possible explanation for this observation is that concentration of surface hydrogen during the synthesis plays an important role in stabilizing the catalyst activity. We postulate that the hydrogen concentration on the surface is higher on an hydrogen reduced catalyst than on a fully carbided catalyst following carbon monoxide or syngas pretreatment. This could be due to a larger number of sites available for hydrogen adsorption, or due to differences in strength of sites for hydrogen adsorption. Metallic iron (hydrogen reduced catalyst) is known to pro- mote dissociative adsorption of hydrogen. When the concentration of surface hydro- gen is sufficiently high the rate of removal of surface carbon through hydrogenation is higher than or equal to the rate of carbon monoxide dissociation. Consequently, the formation of carbonaceous, or inactive carbon, deposits is prevented or limited and the catalyst does not deactivate. Its activity may increase as a result of continued creation of active sites. Water-gas shift activi~ As stated earlier the water-gas-shift reaction activity was not markedly affected by the use of different pretreatment procedures. This may be attributed to relatively high potassium content of the catalyst used in the present study. Potassium is known to promote the rate of WGS reaction [29,50,51 ]. Thus the catalyst behavior, with respect to the WGS activity, was largely determined by its potassium content rather than by differences arising from the use of different pretreatment procedures. In studies with catalysts containing smaller amounts of potassium promoter [ 6,25 ] it was found that the hydrogen reduced catalysts have higher WGS activity than the D.B.

Catalyst selectivity Hydrocarbon product distribution and the fraction of olefins in hydrocarbons obtained during two mass balances for each of the five pretreatment procedures are given in Table 5. Hydrocarbon selectivity remained relatively stable in tests in which hydrogen reductions were employed. After the carbon monoxide and syngas pretreatments, hydrocarbon selectivity usually shifted towards lower molecular weight hydrocarbons, as the catalyst deactivated with time. For example, methane selectivity gradually increased from 4.3 to 5.0 wt.-% between 70 and 150 h on stream in run FB-0352 (i.e. the increase of about 16%). However, such changes with time on stream for a given pretreatment procedure were small in comparison to more profound differences in selectivity resulting from the use of different pretreatment procedures. Therefore, the average values from two or three mass balances were used to compare the effect of pretreatment procedures on selectivity. Fig. 6 compares hydrocarbon product selectivity, lumped into four groups of products: C1 (methane), C2-C4 (light gases), Cs-C~ (gasoline fraction), and C I 2-t- (diesel fuel and hydrocarbon wax). Low methane and gaseous hydrocarbon selectivities, and high C~2 + selectivities were obtained when carbon monoxide and/or syngas pretreatments were employed. The carbon monoxide pretreated catalyst had the lowest methane selectivity, less than 4%. On the other hand, the hydrogen reduced catalyst produced more methane and other low molecular weight 108 D.B. Bukur et al, /,4pplied Catalvsi,s A.

Primary products of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis are l-olefins and, to a smaller extent, normal paraffns. The 1-olefin may be converted to the normal paraffin or the 2-olefin via secondary reactions [ 1,5,14,51-53]. The olefin content, defined as 100lefin/(olefin+paraffin), is a measure of hydrogenation activity. Weight percent olefin content in C2-C4, and Cs-C~ hydrocarbons is given in Table 5, whereas its variation with carbon number (up to C,5) is illustrated in Fig. 7. For each pretreatment the ethene content is always low. The olefin content has a max- imum at C3, and then decreases with carbon number. This shape is believed to be due to either secondary hydrogenation of 1-olefins [ 14,53] or transport enhanced 1-olefin readsorption and subsequent chain termination to paraffins [54,55]. Eth- ylene is more reactive than other low molecular weight olefins, whereas the decrease in olefin content with increase in molecular has been attributed to their (a) greater adsorptivity [5,14]; (b) higher solubility resulting in longer residence time in a slurry reactor [ 53,56 ] ; (c) lower diffusivities [ 57 ] ; and/or (d) transport enhanced 1-olefin readsorption [ 54,55 ]. The olefin contents were generally lower after hydrogen reductions than after carbon monoxide or syngas pretreatments (Fig. 7). These results are not due to differences in conversions. The two hydrogen reductions resulted in nearly the same olefin selectivities, in spite of differences in conversions (Fig. 5). Also for the carbon monoxide and syngas pretreatments, the olefin selectivity did not vary with time on stream, in spite of catalyst deactivation and changes in conversion. D.B.

Effect of pretreatment conditions on 2-olefin selectivity. Ratio of 2-olefin/( 1 + 2) olefins is indicative of olefin isomerization selectivity. This ratio usually increases with carbon number, especially for hydrocarbons in the liquid phase (C8 + ). The increase in olefin isomerization selectivity with increase in carbon number is due to the same factors which affect the 1-olefin hydrogenation and/or readsorption. The longer residence time of high molecular weight 1-alkenes either in the catalyst pores or in the reactor itself increases probability for secondary reactions (hydrogenation, isomerization and 1-olefin readsorption). The 2-olefin content is higher after hydrogen reductions, and is the lowest after the carbon monoxide pretreatment (Fig. 8). This is consistent with trends on total olefin selectivity. In general, the 2-olefin selectivity (i.e. 1-olefin isomerization activity) is low for this catalyst, which is due to its relatively high potassium content. Representative carbon number product distributions are shown in Fig. 9 in the form of Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) plots (logarithm of mole fraction vs. carbon number). It can be seen that mole fractions of high molecular weight products are significantly smaller on the catalyst reduced with hydrogen than on the syngas pretreated catalyst. A three parameter model of Huff and Satterfield [ 58] was found to adequately represent these data: x.=(1-al)a7 J+(1-/3)(1-a2)~ ' where x,, is the mole fraction of products containing n carbon number atoms (hydro- carbons and oxygenates),/3 is the fraction of type 1 sites on the catalyst, and a~ 110 D.B.

The underlying reasons for the existence of two chain growth probabilities are still a subject of debate [55,59,60], and the following postulates have been pro- posed: ( 1 ) presence of two types of sites; (2) dependence of the growth probability on carbon number; and (3) readsorption of 1-olefins. The above findings are in a qualitative agreement with previous studies with precipitated iron catalysts [ 5,6,25 ]. In the early studies at Ruhrchemie (pp. 181- 182, in [5] ), it was found that the catalyst pretreated with syngas (H2/CO = 1.3) yields less methane and more high molecular weight products than the hydrogen D.B. Bukur et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 85-113 111 reduced catalyst. The same trend was observed in studies with the 100 Fe/l0 Cu/ 0.5 K2CO3 catalyst [6]. Also, in the latter study it was found that the carbon monoxide and syngas pretreatments yield more olefinic products in comparison to the hydrogen reductions. The above trends were also observed in our study with the 100 Fe/3 Cu/0.2 K catalyst [25]. Differences in selectivity obtained after the hydrogen and the carbon monoxide or the syngas pretreatments may be due to differences in surface hydrogen concen- trations during the FTS. For example, the olefin contents in hydrocarbons were lower after the hydrogen reductions (Fig. 7). This is consistent with a previously made postulate that the surface hydrogen concentration is higher on hydrogen reduced than on carbon monoxide or syngas reduced catalysts. Higher hydrogen concentration enhances hydrogenation of olefins. Similarly, higher methane selec- tivity and shorter chain length hydrocarbons (Fig. 6) obtained with hydrogen reduced catalysts are the consequence of higher surface hydrogen concentration, since it favors methanation and chain termination reactions. 4. Summary The BET surface area of the catalyst decreased markedly after pretreatments in hydrogen, carbon monoxide or syngas. An increase in particle size was observed after hydrogen reductions both by TEM and XRD analysis. Metallic iron (c~-Fe) or a mixture of c~-Fe and Fe304 were obtained after hydrogen reductions. During the FTS the a-Fe was carburized to a mixture of iron carbides (X- and e'-carbide) or oxidized to magnetite. After the carbon monoxide or syngas pretreatments, the x-carbide was the most dominant phase (84-95%). During the FTS this carbide was partially or completely converted to e'-carbide, Fe304, and/or FeCO3. Regard- less of the pretreatment procedure employed the catalyst samples from the top part of the reactor (reducing atmosphere) contained relatively more iron carbides and/ or metallic iron, whereas magnetite and/or siderite were found preferentially in samples from the bottom part of the reactor (oxidizing atmosphere). The relative amounts of the X-carbide were greater in the top part of the reactor than in the bottom part, whereas the opposite trend was observed for the d-carbide, indicating that, under the reaction conditions used in the present study, the latter is more stable in the oxidizing atmosphere. In the reaction studies, it was found that hydrogen reductions result in stable or increasing catalyst activity with time on stream. The catalyst reduced at 280 for 8 h, had markedly lower activity than the catalyst reduced at 250 for 2 h. This is attributed to a higher degree of reduction in the case of the latter, and migration of sulfur impurities to the surface of the catalyst during the reduction at 280. The issue of sulfur segregation during the pretreatments involving hydrogen (pure or syngas) requires further examination. However, it is clear from both the present 112 D.B. Bukur et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 126 ( 19951 85-113 study and the literature that the pretreatment temperature and duration must be chosen carefully in order to avoid a severe loss in activity. The catalysts pretreated with the carbon monoxide and syngas deactivated with time on stream. This is attributed to conversion of x-carbide to less active iron oxide phases, and buildup of inactive carbonaceous species on the catalyst surface. The carbon monoxide or syngas pretreated catalysts favored production of high molecular weight hydrocarbons, and suppressed the secondary reactions relative to the hydrogen reduced catalysts. These results suggest that the surface hydrogen concentration is higher after the hydrogen reductions, resulting in higher hydro- genation activity, production of low molecular weight hydrocarbons and better stability with time on stream.

A doubly promoted precipitated iron catalyst (100 Fe/0.3 Cu/0.8 K by mass) was characterized after different pretreatment conditions and after Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis in a fixed bed reactor. The BET surface area of the catalyst decreased markedly after pretreatments with hydrogen, carbon monoxide and synthesis gas ( H CO 0.67 and 2). Calcined catalyst was in the form of α-Fe2O3, which was converted to either metallic iron (α-Fe) or a mixture of α-Fe and Fe3O4 after hydrogen reductions. During FT synthesis the α-Fe was carburized to iron carbides (χ-carbide or ϵ′-carbide) or oxidized to Fe3O4. After carbon monoxide or syngas pretreatments, the χ-carbide was the most dominant phase. During FT synthesis this carbide was partially or completely converted to ϵ′-carbide, Fe3O4, and/or FeCO3. Hydrogen reductions resulted in stable or increasing catalyst activity with time on stream and the reduction conditions had a strong effect on the subsequent catalyst activity. The carbon monoxide and syngas pretreated catalysts deactivated with time. The hydrogen reduced catalysts produced more methane and gaseous hydrocarbons than the carbon monoxide or the syngas pretreated catalysts, and favored secondary hydrogenation and isomerization reactions.
