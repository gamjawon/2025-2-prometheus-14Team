Understanding the interactions among the various components of these catalysts is an important step in exploring the nature of the catalytic reactions and provides a valuable scientific basis for the design of novel and efficient catalysts. This review summarizes a number of our recent results in this field. In this work, copper oxide was loaded on CeO2, CexZr1ï€­x O2, and MoO3â€�CeO2 supports to produce model catalysts. Investigations involving these materials demonstrated that the dispersion of copper oxide on the surface of the oxide supports, as well as some of the properties of these catalysts, can be explained on the basis of the incorporation model, which we have previously proposed. Based on spectroscopic characterization of these cataâ€� lysts and examination of their catalytic performance for the oxidation of CO or the selective catalytic reduction of NO with CO/NH3, the relationships among the compositions, structures, and properties of these catalysts are discussed.

Introduction Supported copperâ€�based catalysts offer exceptional catalytic performance at low cost and so are widely used in several inâ€� dustrial processes. Examples include CuO/ZnO/Al2O3, the main catalyst employed in steam reforming of methanol [1], CuO/CeO2, an excellent catalyst for the preferential oxidation of CO (the COâ€�PROX reaction) [2], and CuOâ€�NiO/Al2O3, used in the synthesis of Nâ€�methylpiperazine [3]. In addition to existing applications, supported copperâ€�based catalysts show promise for applications such as the oxidation of volatile organic comâ€� pounds (VOCs) [4], the waterâ€�gas shift reaction [5], ester hyâ€� drogenolysis [6], NO x removal [7], and low temperature CO oxidation [8]. It is important to improve the performance of such catalysts so as to broaden their range of applications and to realize their full potential. For this reason, there is a reâ€� quirement to research the surface compositions, structures, and properties of supported copperâ€�based catalysts at the moâ€� lecular and atomic levels. It has long been recognized that the properties of supported species will always be affected to some extent by the characâ€� teristics of the support materials [9]. There has been significant research into the nature of the interactions between supported species and their supports in the field of heterogeneous catalyâ€� sis during recent years. Since the introduction of the strong metalâ€�support interaction [10] in the late 1970s and the proâ€� posal of the strong oxideâ€�oxide support interaction [11] in the early 1980s, several research groups have studied the interacâ€� * Corresponding author.

Catal., Vol. 34, No. 5, May 2013 DONG Lin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 851â€“864 tions between supported species and supports in supported catalysts to distinguish these interactions from other phenomâ€� ena, using reaction mechanisms or models. Examples of reâ€� searchers involved in this work include Bell and Iglesia [12â€“16] and Wachs in the United States [17â€“20], KnÃ¶zinger in Germany [21], Coluccia in Italy [22], Reddy in India [23â€“25], and Xie and Tang in China [26â€“30]. The oxide supports used by the above research groups were generally polycrystalline powders simiâ€� lar to the supports used in actual catalysis, but in which various crystal planes coexist in unknown proportions, thus making quantitative analysis difficult. Taking advantage of progress in characterization techniques, Goodman et al. [31â€“34] used scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate the dispersion behavior of noble metals on the surface of a single crystal oxide support. It is evident, however, that further work correlating dispersion behavior and structures of surface species with catâ€� alytic properties is required to fully understand the catalytic mechanism, as well as to improve existing catalysts and design new catalysts. Compared with the interactions between metals and metâ€� alâ€�oxide supports, the interactions between metalâ€�oxides and metalâ€�oxide supports are expected to exhibit greater variation because of increased structural complexity based on the forâ€� mation of interacting surface species, solid solutions, and new compounds. Although it is necessary to elucidate the surface structure of the supports to study the interactions between supported species and the supports at the molecular and atomic levels, the single crystals of metalâ€�oxide supports reâ€� quired for study are difficult to obtain, meaning that direct obâ€� servation of the interactions between metal oxides and a single crystal support is also difficult. Based on this, to allow the inâ€� vestigation of the interactions between different types of metal oxides and commonly used supports, the preferentially exâ€� posed crystal planes of supports are primarily considered and other coâ€�existing planes are ignored when considering the surâ€� face structures of supports. Subsequently, based on various characteristics of the supported species (such as valence state and ionic radius), the soâ€�called incorporation model [35,36] is employed to describe the interactions. There are five fundaâ€� mental aspects of the catalyst that are taken into account in this model: (1) the existence of appropriate vacancies on the surâ€� face of the supports allows the supports to serve as the frameâ€� work for the spontaneous dispersion of metal ionic comâ€� pounds; (2) the dispersion of supported ionic compounds on the surface of the supports is based on incorporation of cations into surface vacancies, while keeping associated anions in close proximity so as to maintain electric neutrality; (3) the disperâ€� sion capacities of different types of ionic compounds, such as 1â€�1, 1â€�2, 2â€�1, 1â€�3, and 2â€�3, may vary because the shielding efâ€� fects produced by the accompanying anions differ; (4) different supports have different types of surface vacancies (tetrahedral, octahedral, and cubic), and the same support may have more than one kind of vacancy (for example, both tetrahedral and octahedral vacancies exist on the surface of ï�§â€�Al 2O3), and thus it is necessary to consider the steric or preferential effect when discussing the incorporation of cations into vacancies (that is, the relationship between cation radius and vacancy size, as well as the stability of the coordination); and (5) because of differing surface vacancy densities on different supports, the shielding effects of the same anions will vary based on the supports, and when the anionic shielding effect increases to a certain degree, a surface closeâ€�packed monolayer is formed. Experimental data show that this approximate model can quantitatively predict the dispersion capacity of different metal oxides (such as Li2O, NiO, CuO, and MoO3) on some metal oxide supports within the range of experimental error, such that these experimental results are consistent with the theoretical values. This model can also explain why the dispersion capaciâ€� ties of different metal oxides on the same support are distinct and why the same metal oxide will exhibit different dispersion capacities on different supports. In addition, it has explained why low valence metal oxides do not form surface closeâ€�packed monolayer dispersions on oxide supports. The incorporation of additives into a supported catalyst can change its catalytic performance significantly. For example, the addition of WO3 or MoO3 to V2O5/TiO2 will improve its low temperature activity in the selective catalytic reduction of NO x by NH3 (NH3â€�SCR reaction) remarkably. Although the interacâ€� tions among the components in ternary metal oxide systems are more complex than in binary metal oxide systems, they are closer to the interactions of a catalyst in actual application, and thus it is particularly important to further study this kind of catalyst. The investigation of copperâ€�based catalysts in catalytic CO elimination has been reviewed briefly in our previous publicaâ€� tion [37]. To allow future research work on this subject to proâ€� ceed in a systematic fashion, this paper offers a comprehensive review of our work to date concerning binary and ternary supported copperâ€�based catalysts with applications in CO oxiâ€� dation, as well as in CO+NO and NH3+NO+O2 reactions. Our present work is focused primarily on characterizing the physiâ€� cochemical properties and catalytic performance of copâ€� perâ€�based catalysts supported on CeO2, CexZr1â€�xO2, and MoO3â€�CeO2, exploring the interactions of the oxide components and the relationships among compositions, structures, and catalytic properties with the purpose of providing a scientific basis to assist in the design of highly efficient supported copâ€� perâ€�based catalysts. Some representative examples of our reâ€� search work are discussed in the following sections. 2. CuO/CeO2 Since the early 1980s, the use of CeO2 in threeâ€�way catalysts (TWCs) applied to automotive pollution control and in waâ€� terâ€�gas shift reaction catalysts has become so widespread beâ€� cause of its excellent oxygen storage/release capacity (OSC) and redox properties, and now represents the most important application of the rare earth oxides [38,39]. Until the late 1980s, noble metals (such as Rh and Pt) and CeO2 were used as the active components and support in TWCs with the purpose of simultaneously converting CO, hydrocarbons (HCs), and NO x to CO2, H2O, and N2. In this process, it is necessary to maintain the appropriate airâ€�toâ€�fuel ratio and to work at high temperaâ€� tures (> 327 Â°C). However, these conditions are difficult to meet DONG Lin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 851â€“864 while a vehicle is in operation, especially because incomplete combustion can emit a significant quantity of hydrocarbons on coldâ€�starting of the engine. Furthermore, because of anticipated future worldwide restrictions concerning exhaust emissions, investigations continue with the aim of further improving the performance of TWCs. A significant improvement applied by some automobile companies in the midâ€�1990s was the reâ€� placement of CeO2 by CeO2â€�ZrO2, which enhanced the catalystâ€™s thermal stability and OSC efficiency. This technique, when pubâ€� lished in 1997, prompted a great deal of interest in researching the modification of supports. In addition, there are ongoing attempts to find substitutes for precious metals in catalysts, and CuO has been identified by many research projects as a good candidate for this purpose. To investigate the existing status and redox properties of CuO supported on CeO2 as well as the interactions between CuO and CeO2, we have prepared a series of CuO/CeO2 catalysts with different copper contents using a wet impregnation method and characterized these materials by various spectroâ€� scopic methods [40]. The results of Xâ€�ray diffraction (XRD, Fig. 1) and quantitative analysis by Xâ€�ray photoelectron spectrosâ€� copy (XPS, Fig. 2) demonstrate that the dispersion capacity of CuO on CeO2 is about 1.20 mmol CuO/100 m 2 CeO2 (or 7.1 Cu 2+ /nm 2 CeO2). This value is consistent with the estimate reâ€� sulting from the incorporation model, which considers that all the cation vacancies on the (111) plane of CeO2 are occupied by Cu 2+ and thus predicts 1.22 mmol CuO/100 m 2 CeO2. CuO exists in a highly dispersed state when the copper content is below the dispersion capacity, and no diffraction lines of CuO appear in the XRD patterns of the materials, whereas crystalline CuO can be detected when the copper content exceeds the disperâ€� sion capacity. CeO2 not only acts as the support but also performs the role of promoter when CuO/CeO2 is used for CO oxidation, and this promotion effect is closely related to the ratio of Ce 4+ /Ce 3+ and their transition during the reaction. Ce salts (Ce(NO3)3Â·6H2O and (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6) with different valence states were used as precursors to prepare a series of CuO/CeO2 catalysts, and their catalytic performance for CO oxidation was measured [8]. The corresponding results are presented in Fig. 3, from which sevâ€� eral conclusions can be made. First, comparing the two series of samples prepared by different valence state precursors, we can see that the catalytic activities of Ce 3+ samples are superior to those of Ce 4+ samples at equivalent CuO loadings. This may be because the content of Ce 3+ in the former is higher, a situation conducive to the formation of Cu + â€�â–¡ â€�Ce 3+ (surface synergetic oxygen vacancy (SSOV)), which further improves the catalytic activities of these samples, as seen in Fig. 4.

DONG Lin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 851â€“864 creasing CuO loading up until the appearance of bulk CuO. More bulk CuO is generated with further increases in CuO loading, and the catalytic activity subsequently decreases dramatically. This result is in agreement with the prediction of the incorpoâ€� ration model. Initially, the highly dispersed Cu 2+ ions succesâ€� sively occupy the cation vacancies of the CeO2 surface, increasâ€� ing the probability of Cu 2+ â€�Oâ€�Ce 4+ formation. Further increases in CuO loading after its dispersion capacity has been exceeded will lead to the appearance of crystalline CuO, after which the catalytic activity per single Cu atom decreases because crystalâ€� line CuO makes no obvious contribution to the formation of bridging Cu 2+ â€�Oâ€�Ce 4+ units. Based on these results, we have proposed a catalytic reaction mechanism associated with SSOV [41]. In this mechanism, the surface oxygen in Cu 2+ â€�Oâ€�Ce 4+ is depleted by preâ€�reduction to form surface synergetic oxygen vacancies, which promote the CO oxidation reaction. 3. Bulk modification of the support: CuO/CexZr1â€�xO2 Modification of the supports is a common means of improvâ€� ing catalytic performance. The properties of the supports can be modulated by the addition of appropriate oxides so as to obtain binary or multivariate solid solutions, spinel, perovskite oxides, or mixed oxides. This is directly related to the interacâ€� tions between these oxides and the supported active species. There is a great deal of literatures concerning the screening and evaluation of causes of these interactions, and the results are complex. CeO2 has a number of advantages, but its thermal stability is not good and the highâ€�temperature sintering effect can severely affect its reactivity [39,42,43]. It is well known that a CuO/ZrO2 catalyst employing ZrO2 as a support exhibits excellent catalytic performance for CO oxidation. Moreover, the thermal stability of CuO/ZrO2 is better than that of CuO/CeO2 in the reforming reaction of methanol steam [44]. The phase diaâ€� gram of CeO2â€�ZrO2 indicates that the solid solution can be formed over a relatively large concentration range [39]. The radius of Zr 4+ (0.084 nm) is smaller than that of Ce 4+ (0.097 nm), so the incorporation of Zr 4+ into the fluorite cubic lattice can lead to a decrease in cell volume and lattice parameter in the ceriaâ€�rich CeO2â€�ZrO2 solid solution. Furthermore, the therâ€� mal stability of the support, mobility of bulk lattice oxygen, and oxygen storage/release capacity of the catalyst are also imâ€� proved. In fact, the CeO2â€�ZrO2 solid solution has already taken the place of CeO2 as a support because of its excellent thermal stability [43,45â€“47]. The results of XRD analysis show that ceriaâ€�rich Ce x Zr1â€�xO2 (x â‰¥ 0.5) solid solutions maintain the fluorite cubic structure, which is in accordance with the results of Ayastuy et al. [48]. Therefore, if the preferentially exposed surface of Ce x Zr1â€�xO2 (x â‰¥ 0.5) is also the (111) plane (Fig. 5), the same as in CeO2 [49], we can understand the dispersion of CuO and the coordination environment of Cu 2+ supported on Ce x Zr1â€�xO2 (x â‰¥ 0.5). The dispersion and reduction properties of catalysts based on CuO supported on Ce0.67Zr0.33O2 (denoted as CuO/CZ), as well as their catalytic performance for the NO+CO reaction, have been investigated [50]. As shown in Fig. 6, the dispersion capacity of CuO on a Ce0.67Zr0.33O2 support is between 0.66 and 1.23, while the theoretical value is about 1.20. In addition, bulk CuO is detected in 1.23Cuâ€�CZ. Figure 7 shows that the peak areas for 0.66Cuâ€�CZ and 0.33Cuâ€�CZ at 224 Â°C are approximately equal, indicating that this peak is related to the reduction of surface Ce 4+ to Ce 3+ . The significant increase of the peak area in 1.23Cuâ€�CZ may be related to the formation of crystalline CuO, with the continued increase in 1.65Cuâ€�CZ due to the formation of more crystalline CuO, which is in agreement with the results of XRD.

These results also indicate that it is very important to give sufficient consideration to the dispersion capacity value of acâ€� tive species, as well as the preparation of high dispersion samâ€� ples by appropriate methods to avoid the waste of active speâ€� cies in the preparation of supported catalysts. Samples with different CuO loading amounts (denoted as CuO/CZ) were prepared by an impregnation method employâ€� ing the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 support [49]. The XRD patterns of these materials (Fig. 9) show that the dividing point at which crystalâ€� line CuO appears is at 0.9 mmol CuO/100 m 2 CZ. H2â€�TPR results (Fig. 10) also confirm that there are only two peaks at 170 and 235 Â°C attributed to the reduction of highly dispersed CuO for those samples with copper content below 0.9 mmol CuO/100 m 2 CZ, while the peak at 309 Â°C due to the reduction of crystalâ€� line CuO can only be found in samples with higher loadings. The catalytic activities of these samples for low temperature CO oxidation are displayed in Fig. 11, and the sample with 1.2 mmol CuO/100 m 2 CZ exhibits the best catalytic performance. These results are consistent with the discussion of CuO/CeO2 in the preceding section, indicating that the highly dispersed CuO is the main active species, but also that an excessive loading decreases the catalytic activity estimated according to the turnover frequency (TOF). 4. Surface modification of the support: CuO/MoO3â€�CeO2 Modification of the supports by means of oxideâ€�support inâ€� teractions is widely used in industry. We have previously inâ€� vestigated the catalytic performance of copper oxide supported on MoO3â€�modified CeO2 (MoO3â€�CeO2). MoO3 was chosen beâ€� cause it is widely used in many important catalytic reactions such as olefin metathesis, oxidation, and hydrogenation proâ€� cessing. Furthermore, its low Taman temperature facilitates the dispersion of MoO3 on oxide supports. Partially MoO3â€�covered and fully MoO3â€�covered (via a closeâ€�packed monolayer) supâ€� ports can be easily prepared by adjusting the loading of MoO3, which is beneficial in terms of investigating the physicochemiâ€� cal properties of these systems. Previous research work has shown that MoO3â€�CeO2 catalysts may be applied to many cataâ€� lytic reactions, such as CO low temperature oxidation and waâ€� 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 (7) (6) (5) (4) (3) (2) o (1) I n t e n s i t y 2ï�± /( o ) o CuO o Fig. 9.

Catalytic activities of CuO/CZ catalysts [49]. DONG Lin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 851â€“864 ter electrolysis [51,52]. With regard to the latter, Hang et al. [52] reported that MoO3 did not incorporate into the CeO2 latâ€� tice in MoO3/CeO2 samples, but rather catalytic activity resultâ€� ed from the formation of Moâ€�Oâ€�Ce on the surface of the materiâ€� al, such that the best catalytic activity was obtained when MoO3 loading was at the extent of its dispersion capacity, at which point MoO3 species formed a closeâ€�packed monolayer. This result agrees with our own findings concerning CuO/CeO2. In addition, Rathod et al. [53] investigated the application of mixed oxides in organic reactions in an attempt to substitute these for conventional inorganic acid catalysts because the current catalysts are toxic, environmentally unfriendly and difficult to recycle. MoO3/CeO2â€�ZrO2 exhibited its highest activâ€� ity for the catalytic synthesis of benzimidazole derivatives when the loading of MoO3 was 20 wt%, and this catalytic sysâ€� tem was also shown to be easy to recycle and recover. We have previously examined catalysts based on CuO supâ€� ported on MoO3â€�modified CeO2 and have investigated their catalytic performance when applied to low temperature NH3â€�SCR [54,55]. These samples are denoted as CuO/0.8Moâ€�Ce and CuO/0.4Moâ€�Ce in the following discussion. The 0.8Moâ€�Ce material approaches the dispersion capacity obtained when MoO3 is supported on CeO2. According to the incorporation model, the surface of CeO2 in this material is covered by a closeâ€�packed monolayer formed by oxygen ions accompanied by Mo 6+ . As a result, the supported CuO does not directly conâ€� tact the CeO2. In the case of the 0.4Moâ€�Ce samples, the CeO2 surface is modified only by a partial layer, and consequently some of the supported CuO on the surface of the MoO3 is in direct contact with CeO2. These two cases are shown in Fig. 12(a) and (b). The XRD results obtained for CuO/0.8Moâ€�Ce and CuO/0.4Moâ€�Ce are shown in Fig. 13. It can be seen from Fig. 13(b) and (d) that the dispersion capacity of CuO is 2.06 mmol/100 m 2 on the monolayer MoO3â€�modified support (0.8Moâ€�Ce), which is significantly higher than that of unmodiâ€� fied CeO2 (1.20 mmol CuO/100 m 2 CeO2). This result shows that closeâ€�packed monolayer MoO3 modification is beneficial to the dispersion of CuO. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that CuO disperses in the tetrahedral vacancies formed by the closeâ€�packed monolayer of oxygen associated with the MoO3. The estimated theoretical dispersion capacity of this Fig. 12.

DONG Lin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 851â€“864 material, 2.44 mmol/100 m 2 , is close to the measured value, although somewhat higher, perhaps because the introduction of CuO results in changes to the closeâ€�packed monolayer strucâ€� ture of the surface MoO3. Based onthe above analysis, the dispersed Cu 2+ on 0.8Moâ€�Ce is in a fourâ€�coordination environment and is more difficult to reduce in comparison with Cu 2+ on the unmodified CeO2, which is in a fiveâ€�coordination environment. From the XRD patterns in Fig. 13(a) and (c), the CuO dispersion capacity is only 0.73mmol CuO/100 m 2 CeO2 on the partial layer MoO3â€�modified support (0.4Moâ€�Ce), which is lower than that of unmodified CeO2 (1.20 mmol CuO/100 m 2 CeO2), indicating that the random distribution of MoO3 on CeO2 does not proâ€� mote the dispersion of CuO. One possible reason is that the formation of tetrahedral vacancies on the closeâ€�packed monoâ€� layer is hindered because O 2â€“ accompanied with Mo 6+ can shield some vacancies on the CeO2. Copper species can also interact with CeO2 and MoO3 on the surface of 04Moâ€�Ce. The above discussion is consistent with the H2â€�TPR results disâ€� cussed below. In the H2â€�TPR profiles of 0.3Cu/Ce, 0.3Cu/0.4Moâ€�Ce, and 0.6Cu/0.4Moâ€�Ce samples in Fig. 14, the peaks at 170 and 196 Â°C reflect the reduction of interacting species of CuOâ€�CeO2, while the shoulder peak at 235 Â°C is due to the reduction of Cuâ€�Oâ€�Mo species. It is worth noting that among the samples modified with a closeâ€�packed oxygen monolayer (0.3Cu/0.8Moâ€�Ce and 0.6Cu/0.8Moâ€�Ce), there is no low temperature peak associated with the reduction of Cuâ€�Oâ€�Ce species, which demonstrates that the strong interaction between the closeâ€�packed monolayer of MoO3 and CeO2 obstructs contact between supported CuO and CeO2. Consequently, the interaction between CuO and CeO2 is very weak in these samples. Laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS) results indicate that the dispersion of MoO3 on the surface of CeO2 shifts the peak assoâ€� ciated with the highly dispersed Mo=O end group to higher wavenumbers with increases in the MoO3 loading, from 921 cm â€“1 for 0.2Mo/Ce to 964 cm â€“1 for 0.8Mo/Ce. The microstrucâ€� ture of the highly dispersed surface MoO3 species changes from a common single Moâ€�O tetrahedral species at low loadings (Fig. 15(a), left) to a polyoctahedral molybdenum oxide species at high loadings, as per the diagram presented in Fig. 15(b), left. As a result of coordination with CuO on these modified supports, the Mo=O peak obtained from LRS is reduced. In samples supporting CuO on 0.4Moâ€�Ce, Mo species exhibit a tetrahedral structure while in those supporting CuO on 0.8Moâ€�Ce, the original regular polyoctahedral structure is disâ€� rupted because of weakening or even breaking of some Moâ€“Oâ€“Mo bonds. This process is illustrated in Fig. 15(a) and (b), right. The M=O bond of octahedral (~965 cm â€“1 ) and tetrahedral (~900 cm â€“1 ) species in these Cu/0.8Moâ€�Ce samples changes with increasing CuO loadings, as confirmed by LRS results (Fig. 16).

DONG Lin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 851â€“864 samples, as the CuO loading increases, the proportions of octaâ€� hedral structures decrease to approximately 0.20, 0.12, and 0.05, respectively. These results indicate that the introduction of CuO gradually transitions the octahedral Mo species to the tetrahedral structure and decreases the degree of polymerizaâ€� tion of Mo species because of the strong interaction between CuO and Mo species. In situ FTIR of NH3 adsorption at different temperatures was carried out to investigate the relationship between differâ€� ent Mo species and surface acidity in these Cu/Moâ€�Ce samples (Fig. 17). The results show that Mo species in the polymeric octahedral structure form surface BrÃ¶nsted (B) acid sites, while those in isolated tetrahedral structures form weak Lewis acid sites (L1). The introduction of CuO evidently reduces the quanâ€� tity of B acid sites and produces new and stronger Lewis acid sites (L2). Table 1 lists the quantitative results; the behavior of 0.4Moâ€�Ce and 0.8Moâ€�Ce samples is similar, but the acid strength and quantity of acid sites in the latter are higher. The catalytic performance of some CuO/MoO3â€�CeO2 samples during the NH3â€�SCR reaction as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 18. Generally speaking, the series of 0.8Moâ€�Ce samples exhibit higher activity than the 0.4Moâ€�Ce catalysts. As shown in Table 1, the former has more acid sites than the latter, which indicates that surface acid sites play an important role in NH3â€�SCR. The addition of CuO improves the catalytic activity between 200 and 250 Â°C, which is related to the increase in L acid sites in these samples. At 300â€“350 Â°C, the introduction of CuO leads to a decrease in catalytic activity, perhaps because the role of B acid sites may become more important. These results demonstrate that the NO+NH3+O2 catalytic reaction may progress by different reaction mechanisms in different temperature zones. In addition, we have investigated interactions among the oxide components of multiâ€�oxide systems formed by CuO supâ€� ported on Ce x Zr1â€�xO2 and TixSn1â€�xO2 supports modified by oxides (such as CuO/MnO x â€�Ce x Zr1â€�xO2 [56], CuO/CoOxâ€�CexZr1â€�xO2 [57], CuO/WO3â€�CexZr1â€�xO2 [58,59], CuO/TixSn1â€�xO2 [60], CuO/VOxâ€� Ti x Sn1â€�xO2 [61] and others). The dispersion of active compoâ€� nents and the relationships among compositions, structures, and properties in these catalysts have also been investigated, especially with regard to the oxidation of CO and the selective catalytic reduction of NO. Research concerning interactions among catalytic oxide components is a very wide and complex field of study, and it is important that this work continues, so as to allow progress in both the theoretical understanding and the practical applicaâ€� tions of these materials, especially in heterogeneous catalysis and material preparation processes.

DONG Lin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 851â€“864 development of modern spectroscopic techniques and theoretâ€� ical methods, currently provide favorable circumstances that should allow a more thorough understanding of these catalysts. Our own work to date can be seen as only a drop in the ocean, and additional systematic investigations of the modification of both active species and supports are required to find practical applications for these catalytic systems and to provide a scienâ€� tific basis for the creation and development of improved cataâ€� lysts. 5. Summary and outlook The dispersion of CuO (the main active species) supported on the surface of CeO2, CexZr1â€�xO2, and MoO3â€�CeO2 has been investigated. Based on the incorporation model, differences in the dispersion behavior of CuO on different supports, as well as variations in the corresponding physicochemical properties of the materials, have been explained. We have attempted to esâ€� tablish a structureâ€�activity relationship by using a variety of characterization methods (including in situ and quasi situ) combined with measurements of the performance of these catalysts for CO oxidation as well as CO+NO and NH3+NO+O2 model reactions. There is still some uncertainty, however, reâ€� garding the reaction kinetics of such catalysts in terms of elecâ€� tron transfer and reaction mechanisms related to valence tranâ€� sitions of the copper species. A more comprehensive evaluation of these catalysts is required, including studies of their reâ€� sistance to water and sulfur poisoning and aging characterisâ€� tics, and we intend to pursue such research in the future. CHEN Yi notes: We previously published a paper entitled â€œThe interaction between the double metal oxides and oxide support componentsâ€� in the Journal of Fudan University (Natuâ€� ral Science) to commemorate the anniversary of the passing of Professor DENG Jingfa in March, 2002. Professor Kangnian later suggested that we also write a paper to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Professor Jingfaâ€™s birth. In the intervening ten years, additional work in this field has been performed by Professor DONG Linâ€™s research group at Nanjing University. Professor Dong therefore submits this paper to the special isâ€� sue of this journal in fond memory of Professor Deng. References [1] Jones S D, Hagelinâ€�Weaver H E.

Tel: +86-25-83592290; Fax: +86-25-83317761 Supported copper-based catalysts are widely used in many industrial processes because of their excellent catalytic performance and low cost. Understanding the interactions among the various components of these catalysts is an important step in exploring the nature of the catalytic reactions and provides a valuable scientific basis for the design of novel and efficient catalysts. This review summarizes a number of our recent results in this field. In this work, copper oxide was loaded on CeO2, Ce x Zr1−x O2, and MoO3-CeO2 supports to produce model catalysts. Investigations involving these materials demonstrated that the dispersion of copper oxide on the surface of the oxide supports, as well as some of the properties of these catalysts, can be explained on the basis of the incorporation model, which we have previously proposed. Based on spectroscopic characterization of these catalysts and examination of their catalytic performance for the oxidation of CO or the selective catalytic reduction of NO with CO/NH3, the relationships among the compositions, structures, and properties of these catalysts are discussed. 摘要 负载型铜基催化剂因其良好的催化性能和相对低廉的价格在诸多重要工业催化反应中得到广泛的应用. 探讨负载型铜基催化剂中组分间的相互作用, 有助于了解相关催化作用的本质, 为现有催化剂的改进和新催化剂的设计提供科学依据. 本文综述了近年来我们就CuO在不同载体上的分散、铜物种和载体的改性及其物理化学性质以及催化CO完全氧化、CO+NO和NH3+NO+O2反应性能等方面的研究进展. 结果表明, CuO在多种氧化物载体表面的分散和所得负载型铜基催化剂的一些物理化学性质可参考“嵌入模型”得到解释, 本文主要讨论了以CeO2, Ce x Zr1-x O2和MoO3-CeO2为载体的一些铜基催化剂的组成-结构-性质间的关系.
