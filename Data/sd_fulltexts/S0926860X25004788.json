The surface states of a Cu-Pd nanoparticles supported on SiO2 was investigated by probing the states of adsorbed CO observed by in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopic examination. Here the investigation was carried out on Pd (10 at%)-containing Cu (10 wt%)-supported SiO2, where the amount of adsorbed CO was maximum, indicating the effective activation of Cu metals by the addition of Pd. Particularly, under the atmosphere of relatively low CO pressures (below 10 Pa), the in situ IR spectra show the dynamic changes in the state of adsorbed CO originated from the rearrangement of surface atoms induced by CO adsorption over silica supported Cu-Pd bimetal nanoparticles. The details of changes in the surface states induced by CO adsorption are discussed.

The catalytic activities, however, are not sufficient for the practical application. Then, various kinds of modification have been applied to improve the catalytic performances. Direct activation of supported Cu by the addition of the different active metal, such as noble metal, was one of the effective methods. Particularly, Pd has reported to be one of the effective additives for supported Cu catalyst [4–8]. The catalytic performances were improved markedly by the addition of Pd, and the synagy effects between the supported Cu and added Pd promoted the activation of catalyst surfaces. Therefore, the surface states as well as the atomic composition of the composed metals over the supported Cu-Pd are important factors for discussing the improvement of the catalytic behavior. In order to elucidate the states of supported metal surface at an atomic level, the examinations probed by the adsorption-desorption behavior of gas molecule as well as the states of adsorbed molecules by IR spectroscopy [9] are effective methods since those directly reflect the states of the top layer of supported metal particles in atomic level. CO has been frequently employed as the probe molecule, where the IR frequency of ν(CO) reflects the states of adsorbed CO as well as the surface atom which forms the adsorption site. While the characterization of supported Cu-Pd catalysts has been studied by the examination of CO adsorption by IR spectroscopy [5,6,10,11], detailed states of the surface of supported Cu-Pd has not been characterized nor discussed so far. . On the other hand, the atomic composition of the Cu-Pd bimetallic surface is known to be controlled by the equilibrium originated from the difference of the surface energy between the composed metals [12–17]. This phenomenon is known as “surface segregation”. Since the surface segregation occurs due to the difference of surface energies between the metal components in the bimetal, the atmospheric circumstances influence the state of the bimetal surface. The adsorption of gas molecules over the surface is one of the origins to change the surface energy. As a result, the rearrangement of composition of the surface atoms is induced. CO is known as a typical adsorbate, which causes the surface reconstruction [11,12,17–19]. Therefore, when CO adsorption is applied for the characterization of bimetal surface, the elucidation of the influence of the CO adsorption on the surface states is necessary. In this study, in order to characterize the Cu-Pd bimetallic catalyst supported on SiO2 at an atomic level, the adsorption and the states of adsorbed CO over the surface were investigated by in situ IR spectroscopy. Here. the influence of CO adsorption on the surface states of the supported Cu-Pd are also examined. 2 Experimental The SiO2 supported Cu-Pd catalyst was prepared by an impregnation method. SiO2 (Aerosil 200) was suspended in the aqueous solution of Cu (NO3)2 (Wako pure chemical) and PdCl2 (Wako pure chemical), where the amount of Cu(NO3)2 was 10 wt% as Cu to SiO2 and that of PdCl2 was various molar ratio as Pd to the Cu in the solution, and evaporated to obtain the precursor. The precursor was calcined at 723 K for 5 h to prepare the catalyst. The prepared catalyst (20 mg) was pressed into a self-supporting disk and set in an in situ IR cell connected with an iso-volumetric closed gas circulation system and vacuum line. The temperature of the IR cell can be controlled from 298 K to 723 K. The catalyst was reduced under 39 kPa of H2 at 723 K for 12 h and then evacuated at 673 K for 1 h to be a Cu-Pd bimetal supported on SiO2. CO (99.9 %) used in this study and further purified through liquid N2 trap before use. The adsorption of CO was carried out at 298 K. Since the pressure of the system can be precisely measuring to 1 Pa by capacitance manometer (MKS Baratron model 127AA), the pressure of introduced CO can be controlled from 1 Pa, and the pressure change during the adsorption can be observed precisely. The amount of adsorbed CO was calculated from the pressure change before and after the adsorption. The IR transmission method was applied in this study and the details of the method are shown in a previous publication [9]. IR spectra were recorded with an FT-IR (Jasco. FT/IR 4600) equipped with liquid nitrogen cooled MCT detector. All spectra were measured with 100 scans at 4 cm−1 resolution and obtained by rationing the background spectrum of the catalyst to that with adsorbed CO. The Cu-Pd/SiO2 catalysts were also characterized by transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDS: JEOL JEM-2100, 200 kV). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Influence of Pd co-loading to Cu/SiO2 on CO adsorption Fig. 1 shows the saturation amount of adsorbed CO on Cu (10 wt%)-Pd/SiO2 as a function of the amount of added Pd. The amount of adsorbed CO in Fig. 1 was evaluated from isotherms of CO over various Cu (10 wt%)-Pd/SiO2 at 298 K (see Fig. S1 in supporting information). As shown in Fig. 1, the amount of adsorbed CO is increased by increasing the amount of added Pd with the maximum at 10 mol%-Cu of Pd, Cu (10 wt%)-Pd (10 mol%-Cu)/SiO2 catalyst. The amount of adsorbed CO on Cu (10 wt%)/SiO2 is 3 μmol g−1, while that over Cu (10 wt%)-Pd (10 mol%-Cu)/SiO2 was approximately 90 μmol g−1. On the other hand, the amount of adsorbed CO decrease when Cu(10 wt%)-Pd(30 mol%-Cu)/SiO2 is applied. From the results in Fig. 1, the supported Cu is markedly activated for the adsorption of CO by the addition of Pd. The preferable amount of co-loaded Pd is 10 mol% to loaded Cu. The isotherm of adsorbed CO on Cu (10 wt%)-Pd/SiO2 at 298 K, can be arranged in Freundlich equation, where the relation between Ln (V: amount of adsorbed CO) and Ln (P: equilibrium pressure) show linear relation (see Fig. S2 in supporting information). This means that, when Pd added to Cu, various states of adsorption sites are generated over the surface originated from the strength of the interaction between Cu and added Pd. This also expresses that the heat of adsorption of CO is high when CO adsorbs under low equilibrium pressure and that decreases with increasing the equilibrium pressure. Therefore, the adsorption sites of CO under low equilibrium pressure are formed by the strong interaction between Cu and Pd; such as the direct interaction Cu with Pd. The amount of adsorbed CO decreases at high amount of co-loaded Pd (above 10 mol% to Cu). This is probably due to the decrease of the interaction between Cu and Pd, which is caused by changing the state of co-loaded Pd, such as aggregation of Pd atoms. Therefore, the optimum amount of co-loading Pd is 10 mol% to Cu on Cu(10 wt%)/SiO2 for the activation of CO adsorption. Then, the state of Cu (10 wt%)-Pd (10 mol%-Cu) supported on SiO2 was examined further by TEM-EDS. Fig. 2 shows TEM photographs and elemental mapping images of Si, Cu and Pd simultaneously measured by EDS. As shown in Fig. 2(a), metal particles with several tens of nanometer in diameter are dispersed on SiO2. Particularly, the distribution of Pd is observed in the same place as that of Cu in the elemental mapping by EDS. These results suggest that the supported metal particles are the homogeneous mixture of Cu and Pd as Cu-Pd bimetals. Then, the examination of the states of adsorbed CO was carried out by IR spectroscopy on Cu (10 wt%)-Pd (10 mol%-Cu)/SiO2. 3.2 The states of adsorbed CO on Cu (10 wt%)-Pd (10 mol%-Cu)/SiO2 under equilibrium conditions Fig. 3 shows the IR spectra of adsorbed CO on (a) Cu (10 wt%)/SiO2, (b) Cu (10 wt%)-Pd(10 mol%-Cu)/SiO2 and Pd(10 wt%)/SiO2 under the equilibrium pressure at 27 Pa at 298 K. In Fig. 3(a), a band at 2126 cm−1 attributed to ν(CO) of adsorbed CO in on-top fashion on Cu atoms is observed when CO adsorbs on Cu (10 wt%)/SiO2, while in Fig. 3(c), a band at 2089 cm−1 attributed to ν(CO) of adsorbed CO in on-top fashion and those at 1993 and 1952 cm−1 attributed to that in bridge fashion on Pd atoms are observed when CO adsorbs on Pd(10 wt%)/SiO2. On the other hand, when CO adsorbs on Cu (10 wt%)-Pd (10 at%-Cu)/SiO2, IR bands attributed to ν(CO) of adsorbed CO in on-top fashion are observed at 2126 and 2063 cm−1 as shown Fig. 3(b). From the results in Fig. 3(a) and (c), the band at 2126 cm−1 originate from on top type adsorbed CO on Cu atoms and the band at 2063 cm−1 originates from that on Pd atoms. The results in Fig. 3(b) show that two kinds of CO adsorption sites are presence, one is Cu atom and the other is atomic Pd. Particularly, the IR intensity attributable to adsorbed CO on Cu atom is noticed to increase markedly if Cu (10 wt%)-Pd (10 at%-Cu)/SiO2 is applied. Then, the examination of the states of adsorbed CO was carried out further to make clear the surface states of Cu (10 wt%)-Pd (10 at%-Cu)/SiO2. Fig. 4 shows IR spectra of CO adsorbed over Cu (10 wt%)-Pd (10 mol%-Cu)/SiO2 at 298 K under various equilibrium pressures. The spectra in Fig. 4 were measured after confirming the constant pressure as an equilibrium pressure maintaining for more than 1 h. As shown in Fig. 4, a band at 2063 cm−1, which is attributed to ν(CO) of adsorbed CO in on-top fashion on Pd atom over the supported Cu-Pd surface, is mainly observed under the equilibrium pressure up to 10 Pa, and the intensity of the band is almost saturated at around 10 Pa. The generation of another band at 2114 cm−1, assigned to ν(CO) of on-top CO on Cu atoms over the supported Cu-Pd surface, is observed under the equilibrium pressure above 10 Pa, whose intensity increases with increasing the equilibrium pressure and almost saturates at the pressure around 260 Pa. From the results in Fig. 4, the adsorption sites of CO over the supported Cu-Pd surface are noticed to be Pd atoms under the equilibrium pressures up to 10 Pa, while Cu atoms above 10 Pa. The result clearly shows the existence of two kinds of adsorption sites over the surface; where one is the sites related to the Pd atoms that the adsorption of CO occurs at relatively low equilibrium pressure selectively and the other to the Cu atoms. Therefore, in order to know the states of the adsorption sites related with Pd atom in detail, the adsorption-desorption behavior of CO at low pressure (below 10 Pa) is examined by IR spectroscopy. 3.3 The states of adsorbed CO on Pd related sites Fig. 5 shows time-dependent IR spectra of adsorbed CO under the equilibrium pressure at 5 Pa, When CO was introduced to the system, the adsorption of CO occurred immediately and the pressure of CO became constant (5 Pa). As shown in Fig. 5, at the initial stage of the adsorption, an IR band appears at 2122 cm−1 ascribed to CO adsorbed on Cu, whose intensity decreases in the time course and almost disappears for 1 h. Alternatively, a band at 2067 cm−1 due to CO adsorbed on Pd is generated, and the band is gradually increased in intensity and almost saturated at 1 h. The results in Fig. 5 suggest that CO is selectively adsorbed on Cu sites initially and then transferred to Pd sites under constant pressure. From the previous reports on the surface states of the Cu-Pd bimetal system, the segregation of Cu was observed under vacuum condition. Particularly, the surface was reported to be covered by Cu at low Pd content in the Cu-Pd bimetal [12–17]. The present result, where the IR band of adsorbed CO on Cu was dominant initially, indicates the segregation of Cu over the bimetal surface in agreement with previous reports. In other words, Pd atoms existed in the second atomic layer or below (sub-surface). When the small amount of CO was introduced, the initial adsorption site of CO was the surface Cu atom that highly activated by interacting with Pd atom in the second layer or sub-surface directly. Therefore, the Cu site for the CO adsorption in the initial stage at low pressure (below 10 Pa) is a sort of special adsorption site activated by the direct interaction with Pd. The energetic state of the surface sites was changed by the CO adsorption, and this probably induces the changes of the surface in the distribution of atoms to generate top-layer Pd atoms. The time dependence IR spectra in Fig. 5 clearly show the conversion of adsorption sites of CO from Cu to Pd atoms. Particularly, the number of adsorbed CO on Cu sites is almost balanced to that on the generated Pd sites since the adsorption and the desorption of CO proceeded under constant pressure. This result also suggests that the adsorption site conversion would probably occur over a pair of Cu and Pd atoms. However, the details, such as the states of adsorbed CO over each adsorption sites as well as the states of the adsorption sites formed by Cu and Pd, are still unclear. In order to clarify the details, desorption and re-adsorption of CO over the Cu-Pd bimetal surface were examined. Here, the pressure of CO in the gas phase was gradually decreased and finally evacuating after the transformation of adsorbed CO from Cu site to Pd site confirmed by the saturation of the band at 2067 cm−1 by IR spectra as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 6 shows IR spectra of adsorbed CO under various pressures and evacuation time after the transformation of CO adsorption on Cu site to Pd site was completed at 5 Pa. As shown in Fig. 6, when the atmospheric pressure is decreased, the intensity of the band at 2065 cm−1, due to adsorbed CO on Pd is not changed. Under evacuation, it is decreased in the time course and disappeared completely after evacuation for 1 h. From the results in Fig. 6, CO adsorbed on Pd is stable and hardly desorb when the pressure dropped, and CO desorbed gradually under evacuation. After confirming complete desorption of CO, re-adsorption of CO was performed. Fig. 7 shows time dependence IR spectra of adsorbed CO on the Cu (10 wt%)-Pd (10 mol%-Cu)/SiO2 surface, after the experiment shown in Fig. 6: CO adsorption was conducted at 5 Pa until confirming the adsorption site conversion from Cu to Pd atom, followed by evacuation to eliminate adsorbed CO completely. As shown in Fig. 7, IR band at 2122 cm−1 attributable to ν(CO) of CO adsorbed on Cu is observed accompanied by a weak band at 2068 cm−1 attributable to ν(CO) of CO adsorbed on Pd at the initial stage of the adsorption. The intensity of the band at 2122 cm−1 is decreased gradually and the intensity of the band at 2068 cm−1 is increased in the time course. The phenomena observed in Fig. 7 is nearly the same as those in Fig. 5. This suggests that the surface state of the supported Cu-Pd (10 atom%) particles almost recovered to the initial state before the re-adsorption of CO after desorption of CO under evacuation. The results in Figs. 5 to 7 clearly show the change of the surface state of Cu (10 wt%)-Pd (10 mol%-Cu) supported on SiO2 at 298 K under relatively low equilibrium pressure where CO adsorbed selectively over the particular Cu site that directly interact with Pd atom in second layer, and the adsorption of CO induces the appearance of Pd atom over the surface as CO adsorbed Pd under the equilibrium adsorption-desorption of CO. The CO adsorbed Pd over the surface is stable under CO atmosphere to deactivate the Cu sites for the adsorption of CO. The surface recovers to almost the same state as the initial state if the adsorbed CO on Pd is removed by evacuation. Then, the surface states and reconstruction induced by the adsorption of CO are summarized and illustrated on the basis of the results in Fig. 5 to Fig. 7 in Fig. 8. 3.4 The rearrangement of top layer on Cu-Pd by CO adsorption Fig. 8 describes a schematic diagram of the surface process derived from the adsorption and desorption of CO under relatively low CO pressures (below 10 Pa) over Cu-Pd (10 atom%) supported over SiO2 originated from the results in this study. The top-layer surface of the pretreated Cu (10 wt%)-Pd (10 mol%-Cu)/SiO2 under vacuum consists of Cu, and the adsorption site is the Cu related with Pd atom in the second layer or sub-surface directly. When CO adsorbs over the Cu site, the energetic environment is varied, and rearrangement of the surface atoms proceeds. CO adsorbs on Pd when a Pd atom appears on to the top surface under the equilibrium state of CO adsorption. Adsorbed CO on the Pd atom is stable under CO atmosphere and the Cu atoms as the former adsorption sites are deactivates by the adsorption of CO on the pairing Pd site. CO adsorbed on the Pd atom desorbs under evacuation at 298 K, and after CO desorption, the surface of Cu-Pd (10 atom%) on SiO2 is recovered to the initial state. The surface segregation and the rearrangement of atom distribution on the surface of bimetal induced by CO adsorption has been studied as adsorption induced surface segregation by various methods [12,17–19]. However, few investigations have reported the dynamic phenomena. The results in this study clearly demonstrate the surface states over silica supported Cu-Pd bimetal by in situ IR spectroscopy. Particularly, the segregation of Cu over the surface under evacuation as well as dynamic variation of the surface states induced by the adsorption and desorption of CO was successfully confirmed through change in the states of adsorbed CO. This study clearly demonstrates the variation of atomic distribution of silica supported Cu-Pd bimetal surface by the variation of surface energy induced by the simple chemical phenomenon as the adsorption of CO. On the other hand, under catalytic reaction over solid metal catalyst, the surface energy also changes wildly under progressing the catalytic reaction from the adsorption of reactants to the desorption of the products. This means that the surface energy also changes under progressing the chemical reaction over the surface and the surface states of the catalyst also change with the progress of the surface reaction. Therefore, the results in this study shows that the surface states originated with the surface energy changes under the progress of catalytic reaction over solid catalyst should be discussed when the mechanism of the catalytic reaction is investigated. 4 Conclusion The characterization of a SiO2 supported Cu-Pd catalyst (Cu (10 wt%)-Pd) surface was carried out through the examination of CO adsorption over the surface by in situ IR spectroscopy. The supported Cu particles were markedly activated for the adsorption of CO by co-loading a small amount of Pd, and Cu (10 wt%)-Pd (10 atom%-Cu)/SiO2 was preferable. From the characterization of Cu (10 wt%)-Pd (10 atom%-Cu)/SiO2 by STEM-EDX, the supported Cu and Pd was confirmed to be Cu-Pd bimetal particles of several tenth nm in diameter. From the IR spectroscopic examination under the various equilibrium pressures of CO, the existences of two kinds of adsorption sites were noticed on the surface, where one is the sites related with Pd atom and the other is Cu sites increased by the formation of bimetal with Pd. Time dependence infrared spectra of adsorbed CO successfully demonstrated the segregation of Cu over the Cu-Pd bimetallic particle under vacuum. Furthermore, those clearly shows the rearrange of the top surface where the generation of Pd to the top surface to form CO adsorption sites instead of CO adsorbed on Cu. The top layer recovered by evacuating CO to Cu covered top surface.
