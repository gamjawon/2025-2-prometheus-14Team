P.O. Box 45. Linden. NJ 07036 (UT S.A.) (Received January 30, 1981) Summary Salts of the FeCo3(CO)32 anion promoted with methyl iodide have proven. to be effective catalysts foor the methanol homologation reaction. 'these catalysts are similar but superior to other Co-I homologation catalysts and it is suspected that many similar intermediates are involved. Infrared evidence has shown that the FeCo3 cluster does not remain intact during the reaction, but the nature of the active catalyst species is not known. Monitoring the product composition at short reaction times has shown that acetaldehyde, which is formed simultaneously with a small amount of methyl acetate, is the primary homologation product. By varying many of the reaction parameters, relatively high yields of acetaldehyde are obtained. Ethanol can be produced in reasonable yields under more vigorous conditions than those required for acetaldehyde, but under such conditions side reactions become increasingly important. Introduction Processes which produce clean fuels or chemicals from synthesis gas (CO and H2j O very likely become increasingly important in the near future. The methanol-homologation reaction in which ethanol is formed in two steps from CO and Hz is one such process. When first described by Mender and coworkers [Ij the cobalt catalysts which they employed were of relatively low activity and resulted in low product selectivity. Subsequently, a number of improvements and modifications of the original catalysts have been described. A major advance was the addition of iodine or iodides, which greatly improved the reaction rates [2j . Further improvements were achieved by the use of phosphine additives [3, 41 and the use of mixtures of cobalt and ruthenium catalysts [4 - 61. Although each of these additives resulted in improved performance, a catalyst system that gave both high product selectivities and high conversion was not yet available. Recently, however, a catalyst consisting of cobalt acetyiacetonate, a ruthenium compound, a phosphine and iodine has been 23 8 reported by workers at Gulf and Union Carbide which is fairly efficient and gives good selectivities to ethanol [?] . A very similar catalyst system has also been patented by British Petroleum; however, they report considerably lower yields [8] . A number of workers have postulated that methanol is first converted tc acetaldehyde which is subsequently hydrogenated to ethanol [9 - 13] Although this sequence has generally been accepted, recent work by Deluzarche et al. [ 1.4] suggests that acetaldehyde may not be a precursor. Relatively little vrork has been carried out aimed at producing acetaldehyde by this process compared to ethanol, although acetaldehyde is also a commerci.-lly attractive product. This present study was directed at the investigation of certain bimetallic catalysts for the selective production of either acetaldehyde or ethanol from methanol. Since more detailed knowledge of the effects of reaction parameters on product selectivities and methanol conversions was necessary, much of our effort was concentrated in these areas as well as in a more detailed study of the homologation reaction sequence. Of particular interest in this study were iron-cobalt complexes, especially those based on the FeCo3(CO)12 anion first prepared by Chini and co-workers [' 5] . Experimental Reagents The metal carbonyls were purchased front Strem Chemicals and were used as received. HFeCo3(CO)i, and its salts were prepared by the methods of Chini and coworkers [15] . (Cs,H9).,NCo(CO)4 was prepared by the reaction of K-Selectride * (Aldrich) with Co2(CO)g followed by the addition of (C4H9)4NCI. Reagent grade methanol and toluene were used without further purification- Analysis Gas and liquid products were analyzed by gas chromatography using a Perkin-Elmer Model 900 or a Hewlett-Packard Model 5840A instrument. Columns packed vrith Chromosorb 102 or Carbowax 20M on Gas Chrum Q were used with temperature programming. Peaks were identified by comparing to known compounds on two different columns if possible. For peaks which could not be identified in this manner, identification was made by gas-chromatography - mass spectroscopy performed by the Analytical and Information Division of Exxon Research and Engineering Co. Quantitative measurements were made using toluene as an internal standard. Respon&a factors were either determined experimentally o- were taken from the compilation-of Dietz [16] . * Wa$lCH(C:!3)CZHG13H 239 High pressure reactions The high pressure reactions (27 MPa) were carried out in a I liter stirred autoclave, which was equipped with a catalyst blowcase and was directly fed by high pressure syn-gas lines. The autoclave was charged with solvent (generally 250 O methanol with 50 ml toluene as an internal standard) and the appropriate amount of methyl iodides and the solution then preheated to the reaction temperature. The catalyst, dissolved in 1_00 ml methanol, was then introduced through the blowease, arid the pressure immediately brought to the desired level. Liquid samples were taken at desired intervals during the reaction and a gas sample taken at the conclusion of the reaction. Infrared spectra Infrared spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Model 283 IR, Spectrophotometer using a heated high pressure infrared celi of custom design. The infrared cell was used in conjunction with a 300 ml stirred autocalve equipped as the I liter reactor described above. The reactions were carried out in the standard manner and infrared spectra and/or liquid samples were taken at desired intervals during the reaction. Results Comparison of Fe(CO)5, Co2(CO)8 and FeCo3(CO)iZ A series of reactions were run in order to determine any differences in activity for FeCo3(CO)12 and Fe(CO)5 or Co2(CO)g. The results of these reactions are shown in Table I. The conditions chosen, as we shall see later, TABLE 1 Methanol homologation with Fe-Co complexes Methanol Percent selectivity to\" Catalyst Conversion Ethanol Acetaldehydeb W) Co2(CO)g 9 30 40 Fe(CO)5 2 30 60 C02(CO)g t F(CGF15)3 29 34 52 Co2(CO)g + Fe(CO)s 11 50 40 HFeCo3(CO)12 16 47 43 (C4Hg04N1FeCo3(CO)121 75 73 10 Reaction conditions: 27 Oa, 220 C, I(CO ratio 60/40, six hours reaction time. methanol/metal ratio 2200/1, metal/I ratio 1 /2. aof liquid product only b acetaldehyde plus dimethylacetal 240 were far from optimal but it can be seen that under these conditons, of the unsubstituted carbonyls only the FeCo3 salt showed any appreciable activity. The cluster hydride, HFeCo3(CO)iz did prove to be somewhat more active than either of the individual pure carbonyls, or a mixture of both, but not by far. The addition of triphenylphosphine to Co2(CO)g improved the methanol conversions considerably, as expected, but the selectivity to ethanol remained quite low. The nature of the products is similar to those reported by earlier workers although the relative amounts of each product vary considerably. In general at these high temperatures the FeCo3(CO)12 catalyst produces more ethanol with only small amounts of acetaldehyde, whereas Coz(CO)g gives a much higher percentage of acetaldehyde and consequently larger amounts of higher molecular weight condensation products derived from it. Effect of reaction time on product distrebut:on arid methanol conversion Of all the variables available, reaction time might be expected to have a large effect on product distribution, especially if the reaction products are produced sequentially or if the major products are produced L-idependently at widely different rates. If however, the products are formed independently but at similar rates, then reaction time should have only a minor effect on product distribution. Koermer and Slinkhard [13] have obtained some data for unpromoted Co catalysts under similar conditions but only at two relatively long residence times where only small changes might be expected. By repeatedly withdrawing samples during typical homologation runs we have been able O observe the variance of product distribution and methanol conversion versus time under a variety of conditions. Data for typical low temperature and high temperature runs are shown in Table 2. It can be readily seen that acetaldehyde is the dominant product at the early stages of the reaction. After quickly reaching a maximum the concentration of acetalc;ehyde then gradually diminishes. Ethanol does not appear until substantial quantities of acetaldehyde are present, and products such as 2-buten-l-al and n-butanol start to appear even later. Methyl acetate is present from the very start of the reaction. When samples are taken at very short reaction times (less than 15 min), the only products detected are acetaldehyde, mainly in the form of dimethylacetal, methyl acetate and water; the select_vity to dimethylacetal and acetaldehyde O be greater than 9990 under certtain conditions. At these short reaction times the methanol conversions are quite low. The prospect of maintaining the high selectivity to acetaldehyde raider conditions of high methanol conversions prompted a more detailed investigation. Effect of pressure and temperature on methanol conaers~on arid product selectivity As can be readily seen from Table 3, methanol conversion increases with increasing temperature up to a maximum temperature, then declines rather rapidly. The optimum temperature for highest conversions is about 241 TABLE c Methanol conversion and product selectivity With (C Hg)4NFeCo3(CO)I2 catalyst Product selectivity\" Residence Temp.

The product selectivity also varies considerably with temperature, in general acetaldehyde predominating at lower temperatures while ethanol and to some extent acetaldehyde condensation products become an important factor at high temperatures. T_ he relative amounts of methyl acetate also decrease at higher temperatures. Operating pressures for the homologation reaction play an important Yale in the rate r-f product formation and to a lesser extent in product distribution. There is a direct correlation between pressure and methanol conversion at a given time. In addition, it has been found that high partial CO pressures are necessary in order to operate at reasonably high temperatures. Thus the reaction can reasonably be carried out at up to 220 C at 27 MPa, whereas extensive catalyst decomposition (and consequently low conversions) take place at lower pressures. Catalyst concentration and composition A range of catalyst concentrations from 1 X 10-3 to 20 X 10-3 molar were studied for the homologation reaction- This range is considerably lower than that used in most previous studies [1, 10, 12] . Very little effect was found on methanol conversions and product selectivity at catalyst concentration above 5 X 10-3 molar (see Table 4). B^~low that level, however, a dramatic decrease in both conversions and selectivity to acetaldehyde are noted. The ratio of iodide promoter to metal catalyst shows a similar but TABLE 4 Effect of catalyst concentration on methanol conversion and product selectivity Product selectivitya [Bu,tNFeCo3(CO)12] CH31/metal Methanol Total Ethanol Methyl C + (mmol) ratio conversion acetaldehyde acetate 1 4 15 50 - 47 - 2 4 26 65 - 30 1 3 4 50 7;i 1 16 3 5 4 57 73 2 13 4 10 4 62 74 2 12 5 15 4 66 74 3 10 6 20 4 69 73 3 10 6 2.5 1 35 57 2 9 2 2.5 2 48 70 2 10 3 2.5 4 50 79 2 12 3 2_5 6 53 78 2 10 3 2_5 8 56 77 2 9 4 2_5 12 65 76 2 10 3 2_5 16 20 73 2 9 3 Reaction conditions: 27 Oa; CO/H2 ratio, 50/50; 180 C; I h reaction time. a Liquid products only 243 less dramatic effect on lowering the iodine-metal ratios. The form is which the iodine is added appears to be of some importance with regard to methanol conversions, although it has no effect at all in the selectivity to acetaldehyde. As can be seen in Table 5, both CH3I and Hl appear to be equivalent but iodide salts result in considerably lower conversion. A comparison of the activity of various salts of the FeCo3(CO)FZ anion was made, and the results are shown in Table 6. Also included for comparison are a mixture of Fe(CO)S and Co2(CO)g and the sane combination with (C Hs) NI added- Under the conditions chosen, all the salts are roughly equivalent and superior to the Fe(CO)5/Coz(CO)g mixture, although by a smaller factor than observed at higher temperatures. Interestingly, the addition of (C H9),.NI to the mixed carbonyls results in a catalyst that very nearly approaches the activity of the FeCo3(CO)iz salts. Discussion One of the factors affecting the potential utility of the methanol homologation reaction is its lack of selectivity to a single product. The major by-products observed can be accounted for by a series of simple reaction steps (Scheme 1)_ In the production of acetaldehyde, the by-products of greatest concern are methyl acetate, ethanol and the higher boiling C4 compounds formed by condensation reactions from acetaldehyde.

Since both acetaldehyde and methyl acetate are formed from a eoOmon intermediate some of the ester will always be present. Fn the absence of hydrogen, methyl acetate is formed in very high selectivities under typical 245 homologation reaction conditions. Secondary products such as ethanol and condensation products can virtually be eliminated, but this usually results in lower methanol conversions. Choosing the optimum conditions for product yield inevitably involves a compromise, since some process variables are interrelated and can often a=ffect conversion and selectivity in opposite ways. Nevertheless if the reaction is carried out at relatively high pressures, moderate temperatures and with sufficient catalyst for short periods, it is possible to obtain acetaldehyde in 84% selectivity at methanol conversions of '1590. Under such conditions only small amounts of ethanol and its derivatives are fo-eea and only traces of methane are detected. High ethanol yields are more difficult to achieve with these catalyst.. For optimum yields of ethanol, long reaction times at high temperatures are required, but this results in some catalyst decomposition along with relatively large amounts of methane and high boiling condensation products derived from acetaldehyde. Catalysts employing ruthenium in addition to cobalt are preferred for ethanol production, presumably due to their ability to readily hydrogenate acetaldehyde thereby eliminating any of its undesired by-product derivatives. Fn order to identify the major metal-containing species present in solution, and therefore perhaps identify important reaction intermediates, an infrared study of this reaction was made under operating conditions. We analyzed solutions in which (C4Hg) NFeCo3(CO)I2 and ado a mixture of Fe(CO)5 and Co2(CO)g were used as catalysts, to gain data which would allow us to explain the observed differences in catalytic activity. Unlike Cc2(CO)e which disproportionates in methanol to form. Co(CH30H)6 + [CO(CO) ] 2, salts of the FeCo3(CO)i2 anion show no signs of reaction with this solvent. When a methanol solution of (C4Hg)iNFeCo3(CO)12, which has characteristic infrared bands at 2008, 1371, 1923 and 1828 cnz =, is introduced into an autoclave under reaction conditions, new species are very rapidly formed which have infrared bands at 2050, 2010, 1990, 1985 and 1880 cm-f. This is similar to, but riot identical with, the spectrum observed when a mixture of Fe(CO)s and CoZ(CO)e are introduced under the same conditions (see Fig. 1). Based on these spectra it appears that in both cases the major species present arms Fe(CO)5, HCo(CO)= and some salt of the Co(CO) anion. Although metal acyl species have been observed in some Rh-catalyzed methanol carbonylation reactions, we cannot detect any acylcobalt complexes [ I 7 j . This is not entirely unexpected, since it is likely that an acyl complex would react readily with solvent or HCo(CO)4 to form methyl acetate or acetaldehyde respectively. The intensity of the inked bands decrease with time, eventually resulting in the complete disappearance of all tile bands which can be attributed to the initial. cobalt-containing species. The rate at which the bands disappear is noticeably slower for solutions derived from (C4Hg)4NFeCo3(CO)r2 than those formed from the Co2(CO)e - Fe(CO)5 mixture (see Fig.-2). Since the catalytic activity of these solutions decreases in a similar manner 2 6 1 hr at 150*C 27 MPa1/1C0/HZ FrCo31C0112 7700 7000 1900 1l00 Y, CM-1 Fig. 1.

Box 45, Linden, NJ 07036 U.S.A. Salts of the FeCo3(CO)− 12 anion promoted with methyl iodide have proven to be effective catalysts for the methanol homologation reaction. These catalysts are similar but superior to other CoI homologation catalysts and it is suspected that many similar intermediates are involved. Infrated evidence has shown that the FeCo3 cluster does not remain intact during the reaction, but the nature of the active catalyst species is not known. Monitoring the product composition at short reaction times has shown that acetaldehyde, which is formed simultaneously with a small amount of methyl acetate, is the primary homologation product. By varying many of the reaction parameters, relatively high yields of acetaldehyde are obtained. Ethanol can be produced in reasonable yields under more vigorous conditions than those required for acetaldehyde, but under such conditions side reactions become increasingly important.
