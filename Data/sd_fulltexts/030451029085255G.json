FORMATION OF 2.3-DISUBSTITUTED 1-PHENYLNAPHTHALENES BY CYCLODIMERIZATION OF PHENYLALKYNES* IBRAHIM AMER, JOCHANAN BLUM** Department of Organic Chemistry, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem 91904 (Israel) and K. PETER. C. VOLLHARDT Department of Chemistry, University of California at Berkeley, and the Materials and Chemical Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720 (U.SA.) (Received August 22,1989; accepted January 4,1990) Summary The RhCla-Aliquat 336 ion pair in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane was shown to catalyze both cyclodimerization and trimerization of internal phenyl-alkynes in a highly regioselective manner. Thus, 1-phenyl-l-propyne, 1-phenyl-l-butyne and 4-phenyl-3-butyn-2-one result in the corresponding 2,3-disubstituted 1-phenylnaphthalenes, in addition to the respective 3,5,6- trisubstituted 1,2,4-triphenylbenzenes as the only cyclotrimerization prod- ucts. Diphenylacetylene yields 1,2,3-triphenylnaphthalene and hexaphenyl- benzene. Formation of small amounts of l-chloro-2,3-dimethyl-4- phenylnaphthalene and l-(2-chlorophenyl)-2,3-dimethylnaphthalene, in the cyclo-oligomerization of 1-phenyl-l-propyne, supports a mechanism in which initial oxidative coupling of the alkyne functions produces a 2,5- diphenylrhodacyclopentadiene capable of subsequent ort/io-metallation of the phenyl substituents, followed by metal hydride transfer and reductive elimination of the resultant benzometallacycloheptatriene intermediate. Introduction In the preceding paper [1] we have revealed that various alkynes undergo catalytic cyclotrimerization in the presence of the rhodiumtri- chloride Aliquat 336 ion pair to give mixtures of two substituted benzenes. We now find that internal alkynes bearing at least one phenyl substituent are converted not only into the expected benzene derivatives under these conditions, but also to a substantial degree into 2,3-disubstituted 1- *For parti see [1]. **Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 324 phenylnaphthalenes (eqn. (1)). (1) 2 3 Such cycloaromatizations in which an aromatic hydrogen transfer takes place have been observed occasionally during the interaction of phe- nylalkynes with equimolar quantities of some transition metal complexes (e.g. [2-11]). Catalytic cyclodimerizations of this type have, however, hardly been reported. An example is the transformation of phenylacetylene into 2-phenylnaphthalene mediated by (dicarbonyl)cyclopentadienyliron- (isobutylene) tetrafluoroborate [12]. Experimental General procedure for the cyclo-oligomerization ofalkyi- and arylphenyl- alkynes A 25ml flask was charged with a solution of 40 mg (0.15 mmol) of RhCla-SHaO in 2.0ml of triply distilled water and a solution of 100 mg (0.26 mmol) ofAliquat 336, 3 mmol of dodecane (or another suitable internal standard) and 4 mmol of the alkyne in 1.5 ml of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane. The mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 10 min and then heated under reflux with the aid of an oil bath thermostatted at 120 C until the desired conversion was achieved. After cooling, the organic layer was separated, dried, concentrated, and its contents purified by either chroma- tography or by fractional crystallization. Cyclo-oligomerization of 1-phenyl-l-propyne (1, R =CHy) The progress of the reaction was monitored with the aid of a 1.5 m long GC column packed with 12% OV-17 on Chromosorb W and terminated after 21 h at a conversion of 83%. The solvent-free residue was treated with a 1:1 mixture of ether and hexane to give initial crops of l,2,4-trimethyl-3,5,6- triphenylbenzene (2, R=CH3). Upon concentration of the filtrate and retreatment of the residue with ether and hexane, another crop of the trimer was obtained. The solvent was removed and the resulting mixture was separated either by column chromatography (on neutral alumina with hexane as eluent) or by PLC (on silica gel with the same eluent). The yield provided 213.5 mg (46%) of 2, R=CH3, 55.7 mg (12%) of 2,3-dimethyl-l- phenylnaphthalene (3, R=CH3), 15.7 mg (3%) of a 7:13 mixture of l-chloro-2,3-dimethyl-4-phenylnaphthalene (4) and l-(2-chlorophenyl)-2,3- dimethylnaphthalene (5), and 52 mg of uncharacterized material. 325 Compound 2, R =CHg M.p. 225-227 C (from ether-hexane) (lit.

Results and discussion While the trimerization of terminal alkynes catalyzed by the RhCIs Aliquat 336 system furnishes mixtures of 1,2,4- and 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzenes [I], this work shows that under the same conditions internal phenylalkynes, CgHgCsCR, convert to the unsymmetrical trimers 2 exclusively. The dimerization products formed in these catalyses are solely l-phenyl-2,3-disubstituted naphthalenes free of the corresponding 2-phenyl- 1,3-disubstituted analogs. In light of these results and those presented in the preceding paper, we assume that both the cyclotrimerization and the cyclodimerization processes proceed through a common metallacyclopenta- diene intermediate, namely complex a. Complexes b and c are not likely to take part in the dimerization unless they reversibly isomerized to a. The rhodacyclopentadiene derivative c may, of course, be involved in the catalytic cydotrimerization reactions.

The phenyl moieties in a may undergo ortAo-metallation and lead to the formation of a highly strained rhodium hydride d (for similar strained metallacyclic species see e.g. [19]) that in turn, might rearrange to e. Upon reductive elimination this intermediate gives a 2,3-disubstituted 1-phenylnaphthalene (3) and the starting rhodium complex (see Scheme 1). When the latter process takes place in the presence of excess alkyne, regeneration of a completes a catalytic cycle. 328 Scheme 1. According to this mechanism, the metal-bound hydrogen (in d) becomes H4 in the final product. Indeed, when the oligomerization of 1-phenyl-l- propyne (1, R=CH3) was conducted in the presence of DgO (conditions under which metal hydrides undergo H D exchange [20]) both the NMR and the MS spectra indicate 95% incorporation of deuterium mostly at the C4 position of the resulting naphthalene derivative. The H4 singlet at 7.546 ppm in the ^ NMR spectrum of 3, R = CHg, diminished to an extent of 95%, the C4 signal at 127.16 ppm in the non-decoupled \"C NMR spectrum lost its multiplicity, and the molecular peak in the mass spectrum was shifted to mfz 233. The use of DgO caused, however, no incorporation of deuterium in the trimerization product, since the formation of 2 does not involve the intermediacy of a metal hydride. The isolation of deuterium-free 2 indicates that the transformation of a to b is not reversible. Although we have not denned the exact nature of the non-organic ligands of the intermediates a, d and e, it is obvious that at least one of them is chlorine. Thus, if instead of the hydrogen transfer d-*e the halogen ligand rearranges, complex f is generated, and upon reductive elimination a 2,3-disubstituted l-chloro-4-phenylnaphthalene is formed. (For similar rhodium-catalyzed Cl-H exchange process, see e.g. [21].) In fact, during the cyclooligomerization of 1-phenyl-l-propyne (1, R= CHg), we obtained 3% of a mixture of two chlorinated 2,3-dimethyl-l-phenylnaphthalenes. By detailed 329 ^ NMR analysis, the structures of the chlorinated compounds were shown to be l-chloro-2,3-dimethyl-4-phenylnaphthalene (4) and l-(2-chlorophenyl)- 2,3-dimethylnaphthalene (5). The formation of 5 can be explained by the reversibility of the ortAo-metallation and Cl ligand transfer in d to give the metallacyclic complex g. This intermediate then undergoes further ortho- metallation, hydrogen transfer and reductive elimination (g- h i- 5). Theoretically, g could undergo also ortAo-metallation at the chlorinated phenyl ring. However, the sequence of transformations g- j-*6 is quite improbable since the chlorine deactivates the 6' position of the ring. Thus, it is not surprising that 5-chloro-2,3-dimethyl-l-phenylnaphthalene (6) was not detected among the oligomerization products of 1, R = CHa. ^NMR analyses indicated the absence of chlorine-containing naph- thalenes in the oligomerizations of 1-phenyl-l-butyne (1, R=C2H5) and diphenylacetylene (1, R=CgH5). When, however, 4-phenyl-3-butyn-2-one (1, R = COCHa) was reacted under conditions more severe than those described in the Experimental section (i.e. under vigorous reflux), < 1% of 2,3-diacetyl- l-chloro-4-phenylnaphthalene (7) was isolated. GC-MS (70 eV): m/z (rel. intensity) 324, 322 (M\", 27, 82), 309, 307 [(M CHa)^ 13, 38], 291 (ClaHio^CKr, 5), 289 (CigH^CIO^ 14), 267 (C^H^CIO^ 33), 265 (CuHio^CIO^ 100), 201 (CleHs'1\", 23)). The NMR spectrum reveals that 7 is not accompanied by a second isomer. ^HNMR (CDCIa): 2.021 [s, 3, COCfl3(2)], 2.111 [s, 3, COCHa(3)], 7.306-7.431 (m, 5, ArH), 7.633-7.722 (m, 2, ArH), 7.790 (dd, 1, J^s^ 1.5 Hz, ^,8= 7.5 Hz, H8), 8.404 (dd, 1, <^6,6=7.5Hz, J5,7=lHz, H5)). The absence of a second chlorinated di- actylphenylnaphthalene may result from the pronounced activation of the benzylic carbon in d, R = COCHs, by the electron-attracting acetyl groups. Consequently, all the transferable chlorine becomes attached at this position. Since the ratio of dimer to trimer in the various oligomerizations is not affected significantly by the electronic and steric structures of the alkyne (it proved to vary only between 1:2 and 1:3), we assume that the relative rate of both processes is determined at one of the initial common steps. Thus, the three alkynes that trimerize slowly also undergo slow cyclodimerization, while 4-phenyl-3-butyn-2-one forms both benzene and naphthalene deriva- tives at a much higher rate. 330 Acknowledgements This research was supported by grant No. 86-00013 from the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF), Jerusalem, Israel, and by the Director, Office of Energy Research, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Science Division of the U.S.D.E. under Contract DE-AC-03- 76SF00098.

The RhCl3-Aliquat® 336 ion pair in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane was shown to catalyze both cyclodimerization and trimerization of internal phenyl-alkynes in a highly regioselective manner. Thus, 1-phenyl-1-propyne, 1-phenyl-1-butyne and 4-phenyl-3-butyn-2-one result in the corresponding 2,3-disubstituted 1-phenylnaphthalenes, in addition to the respective 3,5,6-trisubstituted 1,2,4-triphenylbenzenes as the only cyclotrimerization products. Diphenylacetylene yields 1,2,3-triphenylnaphthalene and hexaphenyl-benzene. Formation of small amounts of 1-chloro-2,3-dimethyl-4-phenylnaphthalene and 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-2,3-dimethylnaphthalene, in the cyclo-oligomerization of 1-phenyl-1-propyne, supports a mechanism in which initial oxidative coupling of the alkyne functions produces a 2,5-diphenylrhodacyclopentadiene capable of subsequent ortho-metallation of the phenyl substituents, followed by metal hydride transfer and reductive elimination of the resultant benzometallacycloheptatriene intermediate.
