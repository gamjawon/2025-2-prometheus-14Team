Introduction The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with hydrocarbon has attracted considerable attention because the traditional NH 3 SCR process has such disadvantages as ammonia slip, equipment corrosion and ammonia transportation and storage although it has been industrialized in Japan and Europe for many years [ 1 ]. Recently, indium ion-exchanged HZSM-5(InH-ZSM-5) catalysts have been reported [2-4] to be efficient for the SCR of NO with CH4 in the presence of excess OZ. However, the nature of the active centers and the interaction between indium species and the surface of the carrier have not been fully investigated. To gain full ' Corresponding author. 1381-1169/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PIIS1381-1169(97)00009-5 understanding of these points, much study is still needed. More recently we have found [5] that indium impregnated HZSM-5(In/HZSM-5) catalyst was very active and selective for the SCR of NO with CH4 in the presence of excess 02. In addition, we investigated the reduction behavior of indium species in In/HZSM-5 catalyst and the role of protonic acidity on the activity of In/HZSM-5 catalysts with TPR and NH 3-TPD methods. In this paper, the TPR and NH 3-TPD experimental results are presented. The aim of these studies was to identify the chemical nature of indium species on In/HZSM-5 catalysts prepared by wetness impregnation method and the interaction between indium oxide and surface protonic acid sites of HZSM-5 zeolite. A mechanism has been proposed for the reduction of indium species on In/HZSM-5 catalysts. 126 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The catalysts with various indium loadings (1-20 wt%) were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of the supports, HZSM-5 and NaZSM-5 (Si02/A1203 = 25, supplied by Nankai University, China), with a required amount of the solution (0.03 g In/ml) of In(N03)3. 4.5H20 (from Beijing Chemical Plant, China). Catalysts were denoted by the - wt% of indium contents on the supports. The samples were dried at 80 for 4 h and subsequently calcined in air at 700 for 4 h. All catalysts were pelletized and crushed to 30-60 mesh before use. 2.2. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were performed in a conventional apparatus with a gas chromatograph (GC) (1026, Shanghai Analytical Instrument Plant, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Typically, a sample of 20 mg (in the case of In203, a sample of 10 mg was used) was placed in a U-shaped quartz tube with 5.0 mm I.D. and purged at ambient temperature in a 20 cm3/min 5% H2/Ar flow. The temperature was then raised to 900 at a rate of I1/min. The hydrogen consumption was monitored with the TC detector. The water formed during the TPR experiments was removed with magnesium perchlorate placed just before the TC cell. 2.3. Temperature programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) TPD experiments were carried out on 40 mg of the catalysts after adsorbing NH3 with a U-shaped stainless steel reactor which was connected to a TCD. The samples were pretreated at 600 in a dried helium (Tyt Air Products Pte, Singapore) flow for 0.5 h, then cooled to X. Zhou et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 122 (1997) 125-129 150 and saturated with NH 3 gas. After short purging in He gas flow the TPD experiments were performed by raising the temperature to 700 at a rate of 25/min and in a helium flow-rate of 30 cm 3/min. 3. Results and discussion In the report [5] of our recent work, the In/HZSM-5 catalyst was an effective catalyst for the SCR of NO with CH4 in the presence of excess 02. An addition of only I wt% of indium greatly enhanced the catalytic activity of HZSM-5 and the activity increased with the indium content. However, excess indium was detrimental to the activity. The highly dispersed indium species were suggested to be the active centers for the title reaction. On the TPR curves of the indium impregnated ZSM-5 zeolites (Fig. 1), the high temperature peak (HTP) always appeared when pure In203 (Fig. ld), In/HZSM-5 catalyst with high indium content (Fig. lc), In203/HZSM-5 prepared by directly mixing ln203 and HZSM-5 (Fig. lb), or indium oxide loaded non-acidic materials like In/Na-ZSM-5 (Fig. le) were subjected to temperature-programmed H 2 reduc- z 0 a. w x x w A x 171 a' c ::; - r b 20 0 300 400 5000 600 700 Boo 900 TEMPERATURE() Fig. 1.

These peaks resulted from the reduction process of the surface crystalline In203 to indium metal. Although the indium content in In203/HZSM-5 catalyst was also 10 wt%, its HTP intensity was much greater than that of 10 wt% In/HZSM-5. The reason might be that the extent of indium dispersion in In203/HZSM-5 catalyst was much lower than that in 10 wt% In/HZSM-5 catalyst and much crystalline In203 was formed. In Fig. 2 the TPR spectra of In/HZSM-5 catalysts with different In loadings were depicted. Two peaks appeared on the TPR spectra, indicated as low (LTP) and high temperature peaks (HTP). Only the LTP of indium reduction appeared when In loadings were less than 5 wt%. The intensity of LTP increased with the indium loading until the maximum limit In loading for the dispersion capability of indium oxide on the surface of HZSM-5 zeolite was attained. By further loading with indium oxide the intensity of LTP practically did not change and a HTP appeared. Since the LTP did not appear on the TPR spectra of pure In203 and of 10 wt% In/NaZSM-5 (Fig. le), the appearance of LTP could be due to the reduction of the highly dispersed indium species formed during the preparation of In/HZSM-5 catalysts because of 127 150 the strong interaction between surface indium species and the protonic acid sites of HZSM-5 zeolite. It was suggested that only the one-dimensional network of indium species was formed on HZSM-5 zeolite surface at very low In loading, whereas at In loadings higher than 10 wt%, the formation of the surface crystalline In203 occurred. As shown in Fig. 3, two NH 3 desorption peaks appeared on every TPD profile except on that of 10 wt% In/NaZSM-5 (Fig. 3f). The intensity of both the high and low temperature TPD peaks decreased as the In loading increased and the decreasing extent of the high temperature TPD peak was much greater than that of the low temperature TPD peak. The high temperature desorption peaks were suggested to result from strong protonic acid sites which were relevant to silanol (Si-OH-AI) [6]. We believed that the acid sites interacting with surface indium species were mainly protonic acid sites and that exchanges between indium ions b y 1 , \\ d .- e \\v ~e ,11 f 250 350 450 550 650 750 TEMPERATURE(C) Fig. 3.

Zhou et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 122 (1997)125-129 and protons of HZSM-5 occurred readily during the preparation of In/HZSM-5 catalysts. It is generally accepted [7-9] that it is difficult to exchange trivalent ions into ZSM-5. Because the lattice is relatively hydrophobic and the anionic field is weak, precipitation of hydroxides and exchange of metal hydroxide ions such as [M(OH)2]+ would be possible. Similarly to the recently reported [10-14] investigation on the status of gallium in gallium containing zeolites, a mechanism for the reduction of indium species in In/HZSM-5 catalysts has been proposed. In203 + 3142 -3,21n + 31420 In203 + 214+Z-+ 2142 -* 2In+Z-+ 31420 (2) Eqs. (1) and (2) can be broken down into two and four steps, respectively, which is helpful to the understanding of these reduction processes. In203 + 2142 -3- In20 + 21420 In20+142-o2In+1420 In203 + 214+Z-+ H20 -> 2 (In(OH)2)+Z- In(OH)2 Z--j (In0)+Z-+ H20 In203 + 214+Z--> 2(In0)+Z-+ H20 (la) (lb) (2a) (2b) (2c) (In0)+Z-+ HZ -+ In+Z-+ H20 (2d) Eq. (2a), or the presence of protons in HZSM-5 zeolite, were critical for the proceeding of Eq. (2). In the case of 10 wt% In/NaZSM-5, Eq. (2a) could not proceed and so there was no LT? in its TPR spectrum (Fig. le). During the impregnation and calcination process, the solid-state ion exchange (Eq. (2c)) between the highly dispersed In203 and the protons of HZSM-5 zeolite could occur readily. After TPR experiments, the colors of the catalysts were from grey to black, which was due to In20 or In+Z-, while the color of reduced In203 was white, the same as that of indium metal. It was believed that after reduction the indium species in In/HZSM-5 catalysts at least partially existed as In20 or In+Z-. Because of the striking feature that the In 3+ ions were six coordinated in the bulk of ln203 and only three coordinated on the surface of HZSM-5 zeolite, the (In0)+ had more mobility than the In 31 ions in the bulk of In203 and so the (In0)+ was easier to be reduced than the-bulk In203. However, because of the synergism between indium species and protonic acid sites of ZSM-5 the In+Z- was very stable and more difficult to be reduced at 900. In addition, the In+ was difficult to be sublimated although the sublimating temperature of In20 is only 650-700. Thus there was no HTP in the TPR spectra of In/HZSM-5 catalysts with In loadings lower than 5 wt% (Fig. 2). When In loading exceeded the optimal indium content, a high temperature peak (HT?) appeared due to the reduction of bulk In203 itself according to Eq. (1). Infrared transmission (IR) study of chemisorbed pyridine to investigate the interaction between surface indium species and protonic acid sites of HZSM-5 and XPS measurements to further study the status of indium in In/HZSM-5 catalysts have also been initiated in our laboratory. 4. Conclusions Flow reactor TPR experiments along with TPD of ammonia indicated that indium ions exchanged with the protons of HZSM-5 zeolite when HZSM-5 was impregnated with indium nitrate solution and then calcined. These processes resulted in the great decrease of protonic acidity, the formation of highly dispersed indium species which were suggested to be the active centers for the SCR of NO with CHQ in the presence of OZ and a strong interaction between the indium species and the protonic acid sites of the zeolite framework. The presence of protons in zeolite support was a prerequisite for appearance of LT? in the TPR spectra of In/HZSM-5 catalysts and for the X. Zhou et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 122 (1997) 125-129 formation of active centers for the title reaction. The (In0) + was easier to be reduced than the bulk In203 while the In+Z` was more difficult to be reduced than In 20.
