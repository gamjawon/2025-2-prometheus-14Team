A. Vikulov, B. N. Shelimov* and V. B. Kazansky N.D. Zelinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry, USSR Academy of Sciences, Moscow 117 913 (Russia) (Received July 8, 1991; accepted September 10, 1991) Abstract The interaction of 1,3,5-cycloheptatriene (CHT) with surface Mo4+ ions produced by preliminary photoreduction of Moe+/Si02 catalyst in carbon monoxide was investigated. It was found that CHT chemisorption at room temperature followed by heating the catalyst at Tz 150 C resulted in the formation of surface carbenes Mo=CH2, which were identified by their ER and W-Vis spectra. CHT decomposition to Mo=CHz and benzene at elevated temperatures was shown to be accompanied by a variety of side reactions. The specific activities of photoreduced Mo'+/Sioz for propene metathesis increased by a factor of 4-5 as a result of CHT treatment. A general scheme for CHT interaction with surface Mo'+ ions is discussed. Mo=CHz concentration for CHT-treated catalysts was found to be approximately one order of magnitude lower than that produced by cyclopropane chemisorption on photoreduced Mo +/Si0z. Introduction Earlier we reported that photoreduced silica-molybdena catalysts (Mo4+/ Si02) treated with cyclopropane exhibited high catalytic activity for propene metathesis in the gas phase [ 1, 2 ] and 1-hexene metathesis in the liquid phase [3]. As was shown in [1, 2, 4], the cyclopropane promoting effect was due to the formation of surface carbene complexes Mo=CHZ resulting from cyclopropane interaction with Mo4+ ions produced during preliminary photoreduction of M06+/Si02 in CO [5]: O O~ //CHZ 11 0 C H2 2 Mo + Q -r Mo + Mo ~ Oi \\OCH (1) Si Si Si Si Si Si i1\\ iI\\ i1\\ i1\\ i1\\ iii *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 0 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved 118 Mo=CH2 species were identified using IR and UV-Vis spectroscopies [2, 6]. Formation of Mo=CH2 and Mo=CH-CH3 carbene complexes after methylcyclopropane chemisorption on Moo+/Si02 and their transformations were studied in our previous paper [7]. In the present work, the possibility of Mo=CH2 formation from 1,3,5cycloheptatriene (CHT) chemisorbed on photoreduced Moo+/Si02 catalyst was investigated. CHT can be regarded as a potential source of carbene species, since according to thermochemical data [8] its decomposition to benzene and free CH2: is less endothermic than that of cyclopropane to ethylene and CH2: I I -- CrH6 + CH2 : (3131) 0 H = 66 kcal mol-1 CH2 C2H4 + CHZ : (3131) 4 H 0 = 86 kcal mol'1 Consequently, one may expect that CH2: formation would be more facile in the former case. Indeed, Archibald et al. [9] have shown that CHT decomposed approximately by 809'0 to benzene and a mixture of C1-C4 alkenes over a 109'0 Re207/AI203 catalyst at 473 K. In the presence of ethylene small amounts of cyclopropane were found, thus confirming indirectly Re =CH2 formation on the catalyst surface. No data on CHT interaction with Mo/Si02 have been reported in the literature thus far. Experimental Conunercial KSK-2-5 silica-gel (S=300 m2 g-1) prewashed in boiling HCl to remove iron impurities was used in this study. Mog+/Si02 samples (1 wt.% Mo) were obtained by impregnation of silica with an aqueous solution of ammonium paramolybdate followed by drying in air and calcination in OZ flow at 400-500 C. Prior to photoreduction, the samples were heated in dry oxygen (100 torr, 1 h) at 750-800 C and then in vacuum (510-4 torr) at the same temperature using a vacuum system supplied with greaseless metallic valves. In order to avoid reduction of MoB+ ions during high temperature vacuum treatment, the samples were cooled to 300-500 C in dry oxygen (20 torr) and then repeatedly evacuated to a residual pressure of -.<~ 10-4 torr. Photoreduction of pretreated samples in CO at 10-20 torr was carried out at room temperature using full radiation of a high pressure mercury lamp in a quartz cell under gas circulation. The extent of MoO+ photoreduction to the Mo'+ state was determined by measuring the evolved CO2; for an irradiation time of 1.5-2 h it reached = 509'0. After photoreduction the samples were outgassed at 150-200 C. The carbon monoxide used in this study was purified from CO2, H20 and OZ by successive passage through a cold trap (77 K) and a column 119 filled with Cr2+/Si02 catalyst. 1,3,5-Cycloheptatriene (Fluka) was purified by vacuum distillation. According to GLC analysis the final product was of more than 97% purity. Deuterated ethylene (80% C2Dq and 20% C2D3H) was used without further purification. Cyclopropane was freed from impurities by triple freeze-pump-thaw cycles. Diffuse-reflectance spectra in the range of 200-850 nm were taken with a Specord M-40 spectrophotometer, supplied with an integrating sphere. IR diffuse-reflectance spectra in the C-H stretching region (2800-3200 cm-1) were obtained with a Perkin-Elmer 580 B instrument using optical cells supplied with calcium fluoride windows. Due to poor signal intensity the resolution was within =10 cm-1. Thermodesorption products and the mixture of deuterated ethylenes were analyzed with a UTI-100 C quadrupole mass spectrometer. Rates of propene metathesis at room temperature were measured in a gas circulating system with total reaction volume of 660 cm' at initial propene pressures of 90-110 torr. Catalyst sample weights were 0.1-0.2 g. Gas phase compositions were controlled mass spectroscopically. Reaction rates were calculated using linear transformations of kinetic curves, derived from a Langmuir-Hinshelwood model [10]. Results Unreduced Mos+/Si02 showed no appreciable CHT chemisorption at room temperature. On the contrary, pulsed adsorption experiments showed that the ratio of CHT chemisorbed on photoreduced Moo+/Si02 to initial Mo4+ concentration was close to unity. This supports the conclusion that Mo4+ ions act as the adsorption centers. No gaseous products of CHT decomposition were detected at room temperature after completion of CHT chemisorption. Upon heating a M04+/Si02 sample with adsorbed CHT, two thermodesorption maxima (at 125 and 325 C) were observed. According to mass spectroscopic analysis the major thermodesorption products at 150 C were CHT, benzene and acetylene (Fig. la). At 325 C benzene, cyclopentene, acetylene and small amounts of CHT were evolved into the gas phase (Fig. lb). Above 200 C, hydrogen evolution commenced, evidencing dehydrogenation of the surface hydrocarbon fragments. These data clearly show CHT decomposition on the surface above 100-125 C. In particular, benzene formation can be considered an indication of methylene splitting out from the CHT molecule and of Mo=CH2 complex formation. This conclusion was further confirmed by spectroscopic measurements. UV Vis spectra of photoreduced M04+/Si02 before and after CHT chem isorption vs. unreduced Moe+/Si02 as a reference are shown in Fig. 2. Three absorption bands (ABs) at 360, 640 and 790 run in Fig. 2a are due to the d-d transitions in Mo'+ ions (d2 configuration) [5]. After CHT chemisorption at 20 C, new ABs at 435 and 690 nm appeared (Fig. 2b).

Subsequent treatment in oxygen at 20 C led to full oxidation of the M04+ ions, while the intensity of the Mo=CHZ AB decreased only slightly (Fig. 2d). IR spectra of a photoreduced M04+/Si02 sample with chexnisorbed CHT in the C-H stretching vibration region are shown in Fig. 3. The spectrum in Fig. 3b is rather complicated and its unambiguous interpretation is hardly possible. However after heating the sample in vacuum at 330 C, its O spectrum was considerably simplified (Fig. 3c): two ABs at 3080 and 2945 cm-1 became predominant, which, in agreement with the assignment made in [2], could be attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric C-H vibrations in Mo=CH2, respectively. Thus, IR data also evidenced methylene complex formation. The data on specific catalytic activities in the gas phase propene metathesis over M04+/Si02 with chemisorbed CHT are summarized in Table 1. Room temperature CHT chemisorption did not lead to appreciable increase in catalytic activity (Run 2). However after heating the catalyst at 150 or at 330 C, specific activities increased by a factor of 5-7 (Runs 3 and 4), apparently due to an increase in Mo=CH2 concentration.

This feature parallels the behavior of Mo=CH2 in the presence of OZ (Mg. 2d). It should be noted however that activity of the catalysts treated with CHT was inferior to that treated with cyclopropane (Table 1), obviously due to lower initial Mo=CH2 concentration in the former case. Two methods could be employed to measure Mo=CH2 concentration. The first one is based on exchange reaction between Mo=CH2 and C2D4 (6]: Mo=CH2+C2D4 r- Mo=CD2+CH2=CD2 Exposure of the sample to C2D4 led to the appearance of CH2=CD2 in the gas phase. Taking into account that under excess C2D4 this equilibrium was shifted to the right, one could calculate the number of the surface CH2 fragments by measuring the CH2=CD2 concentration. Another method consisted of measuring the amount of C02 formed during full oxidation of a catalyst with Mo=CH2 species in 02 at 600 C [7]. For cyclopropane-treated Mo/Si02 catalysts both methods gave close values for Mo=CH2 concentration (Table 2), while for CHT-Mo/Si02, the amount of Mo=CH2 determined by the `oxidation' method was essentially higher than that obtained by the 'exchange' one. However this discrepancy can be easily understood, since during oxidation, C02 was produced from both Mo=CH2 and other carbon-containing surface species derived from chemisorbed CHT molecules. Nevertheless, Table 2 shows that Mo=CH2 concentration for cyclopropane-Mo/Si02 was approximately one order of magnitude higher than that for CHT-Mo/Si02. This confirms the lower catalytic activity of the latter system in propene metathesis (Table 1). Discussion It follows from the data obtained that interaction of CHT with Moo+/ Si02 proceeds in a rather complicated stepwise manner (see Scheme 1), 124 Mo4+ + CHT 20 C 150 C 150 C Q + C2 H2 ~-I---- --- Q Mo-CH 2 + C6Hs Mo Mo 3 00 C 300 C Mo + 0 Dehydrogenation products + H 2 Scheme 1. discussion of which we begin with the CHT chemisorption at room temperature. Taking into account that no increase in catalytic activity was observed and that no gaseous products of CHT decomposition were found at this temperature, one may suggest that CHT chemisorbs on Mo4+ ions mainly in a molecular form. Most likely the CHT molecule, having three conjugated double bonds, yielded an 77-type complex with Moo+, which is characterized by ABs at 435 and 690 nm in the W Vis spectrum (FSg. 2b). Since the ratio of CHT adsorbed to N(M04+) in the photoreduced sample was found to be close to unity, we suggest formation of an (77-1,6-C7H8)Mo complex, which is analogous to (77-1,6-C7H8)Mo(CO)2 described in the literature [11-141. Such complexes were reported to catalyze the metathesis reaction in some cases. Thus, the CHT-Mo(CO)2 complex in the presence of (Et2AIC1+Bu4NC1) as promoter catalyzed 1-butene liquid phase metathesis [151 and 4-nonyne metathesis at 110 C in toluene solutions in the presence of phenol [ 161. It was proposed [ 161 that coordination vacancies created by removal of CO from the mo lybdenum coordination sphere may play the role of precursors of catalytically active sites. However no formation of Mo-carbenes resulting from decom position of (,7-1,6-C7H8)Mo(CO)2 was reported. On the contrary, the data obtained in the present study clearly indicate Mo=CHZ formation upon heating M04+/Si02 with chen-isorbed CHT. This was evidenced by a considerable increase in catalytic activity (Table 1), benzene formation, and W-Vis and IR data (Figs. 2 and 3). However decomposition of the CHT-Mo4+ complex to CH2: and benzene is obviously not the only reaction pathway. Thus, acetylene evolution indicated contraction of the CHT C7-ring to a C6-ring and possible formation of cyclopentadiene-Mo4+ complex. At 250-300 C, dehydrogenation of the surface hydrocarbon fragments was likely accompanied by hydrogenation of the cyclopentadiene ligand to yield some cyclopentene, which was found massspectroscopically among the thermodesorption products. 125 As already mentioned (see Introduction), CHT decomposition to benzene and free CH2: in the gas phase is more facile than that of cyclopropane to ethylene and CH2:. Nevertheless, the Mo=CHZ yield was turned out to be substantially higher for the cyclopropane-Mo+/Si02 system (Table 2). Apparently, this can be explained in the following way. Unlike cyclopropane, the CHT molecule, having three conjugated double bonds, can form a very strong molecular complex with Moo + ions, which is stable at room temperature. As a result, decomposition of CHT-Mo4+ to Mo=CHZ and benzene was possible only at elevated temperatures and was accompanied by a variety of side reactions, reducing the Mo=CHZ yield. In contrast, the decomposition of cyclopropane to Mo=CHZ and CZH4 occurred smoothly even at room temperature, the selectivity being as high as 94-95ssh [2, 6]. References 1 I. V. Elev, B. N.

        "dc:description": "The interaction of 1,3,5-cycloheptatriene (CHT) with surface Mo4+ ions produced by preliminary photoreduction of Mo6+/SiO2 catalyst in carbon monoxide was investigated. It was found that CHT chemisorption at room temperature followed by heating the catalyst at T⩾ 150 °C resulted in the formation of surface carbenes MoCH2, which were identified by their IR and UVVis spectra. CHT decomposition to MoCH2 and benzene at elevated temperatures was shown to be accompanied by a variety of side reactions. The specific activities of photoreduced Mo4/SiO2 for propene metathesis increased by a factor of 4–5 as a result of CHT treatment. A general scheme for CHT interaction with surface Mo4+ ions is discussed. MoCH2 concentration for CHT-treated catalysts was found to be approximately one order of magnitude lower than that produced by cyclopropane chemisorption on photoreduced Mo4+/SiO2.",
