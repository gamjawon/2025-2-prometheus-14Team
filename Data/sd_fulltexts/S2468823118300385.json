Graphical abstract A series of H4SiW12O40-modified Fe2O3 catalysts were synthesized using the precipitation method. Over 80% NO x conversion was obtained in the temperature region of 250–450 °C for the catalysts with the H4SiW12O40 content of 5% and 10%. The relationship between the physicochemical properties and performances of the series catalysts was established. Abundant acid sites were introduced with doping H4SiW12O40, which promoted the adsorption of reductant NH3 on the catalysts at high-temperature regions. Moreover, adding H4SiW12O40 lowered the amount and reducibility of catalyst surface reactive oxygen species, which inhibited the oxidation of NH3 to NO x at higher temperatures to some extent. Thus, most ammonia species were prone to participating in the reaction with NO x instead of being directly oxidized to NO x in the higher temperature region over the H4SiW12O40-decorated catalysts. And it could be concluded that the balance of the acid and redox properties constituted the main reason for the superior activity of the high H4SiW12O40 content catalysts. Additionally, SO2 exerted a slight and reversible inhibition effect on the catalyst activity at 300 °C, suggesting that HSiW-modified Fe2O3 oxide might be a promising catalyst in practical applications. Keywords H4SiW12O40 Fe2O3 Acid properties Redox properties Activity 1 Introduction The selective catalytic reduction of NO with NH3 (SCR) is confirmed to be an effective technology for the abatement of NO x from both mobile and stationary sources [1]. WO3 or MoO3 promoted V2O5/TiO2 is the commercialized catalyst system in stationary applications. However, several actual problems come out in the applications of this catalyst system, such as the narrow operation temperature window (320–420 °C), and the toxicity of vanadium species to environment and human health. For these reasons, much attention has been focused on the development of efficient and environmentally benign catalysts, aiming to replace the present V2O5-based catalyst system. It is well-accepted that the coexistence of acid and redox functions can be detected in the SCR catalysts [1]. The enhanced redox properties are considered to promote the activation of the adsorbed ammonia species and NO x , which mainly explains the high reactivity of catalysts in the lower temperature region [2,3]. However, a decline in the deNO x efficiency is always observed at a temperature higher than 400 °C for the catalysts possessing an excellent low-temperature activity [4]. It seems that a strong catalyst oxidability exerts a negative effect on the high-temperature SCR reactions. By contrast, the addition of SO2 makes the catalyst operation temperature window shift towards higher temperatures in a certain extent; the enhanced acid properties, together with the weakened redox properties resulting from the formation of sulfated active components might explain the declined low-temperature activity of the catalysts and the promoted SCR reactions at high-temperature regions to some extent [5,6]. It seems that the balance of the acid and redox properties could make a catalyst possess an excellent activity in a wide temperature range, on which scanty research has been conducted. But knowledge of such effects might help to get insight into the correlations between the physicochemical properties and performances of the catalysts and provide a theoretical basis for the design of new catalyst systems. Fe2O3 is widely used as catalyst support, promoters and active components in the SCR reactions [7,8]; the novel reducibility and a lack of surface acid sites illustrate that Fe2O3 could mainly provide redox sites for the activation of NH3 and NO x [2]. H4SiW12O40 (HSiW for short) is well-known for its extraordinarily strong acidity, on which abundant acid sites could be available for the adsorption of NH3 [9]. Therefore, a combination of Fe2O3 which possesses an excellent redox behavior and HSiW with a unique acid property might help to investigate the effect of acidity and oxidability on the SCR activity of the catalysts. And a satisfactory activity and N2 selectivity might be obtained through tuning the loading amount of HSiW. For these reasons, a series of HSiW-modified Fe2O3 catalysts were prepared in this study. The relationship between the physicochemical properties and performances of the catalysts would be explored, which aims to discover the importance of the balance of the catalyst acid and redox properties in the SCR reactions. X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption and Raman spectra were conducted to investigate the physical structures of the series catalysts. NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) and in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) were carried out to discover the role of HSiW in the acidity of the catalysts. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were adopted to study the variations in the catalyst redox properties through adding HSiW. Finally, SO2 tolerance tests were carried out to illustrate that HSiW-modified Fe2O3 oxide might be a promising catalyst in practical applications. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals P25 (85%: anatase, 15%: rutile; SBET = 55 m2g−1) was purchased from Degussa. NH4VO3 (AR: 99.0%), H40N10O41W12·xH2O (AR, WO3 content: 85%–90%), H4SiW12O40·xH2O (AR), ammonium hydroxide (AR: 25%–28%), C2H2O4·2H2O (AR: 99.5%) and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (AR: 98.5%) were available from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. N2, O2, NO (0.5% NO + 99.5% N2), SO2 (0.5% SO2 + 99.5% N2), and NH3 (0.5% NH3 + 99.5% N2) were obtained from Hangzhou New Century Mixed Gas Co., Ltd. 2.2 Preparation of the samples Fe2O3 support (named as Fe) was prepared using the precipitation method. The calculated amount of Fe(NO3)3 was dissolved in deionized water. The obtained solution was slowly added into the excess ammonia solution under continuous stirring. After that, the precipitates were obtained by filtration, washed by deionized water for several times, dried at 110 °C for 8 h and then calcined at 500 °C in air for 5 h. As for the preparation of the HSiW-modified catalysts, the as-prepared Fe2O3 support was immersed into HSiW solution. Excess water was removed by using a rotatory evaporator. The HSiW loading amount was determined by tuning the concentration of the used solution. All the catalysts were dried at 110 °C overnight and then calcined at 500 °C for 5 h. Finally, the obtained catalysts were crushed and sieved into 40-60 meshes for the activity tests. The samples were named based on the content of HSiW. For example, 10% HSiW-Fe means that 10 wt.% HSiW was loaded on the Fe surface. V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst (donated as VW/Ti) containing 1 wt.% V2O5 and 5 wt.% WO3 was synthesized using the wet-impregnation method. Certain amounts of NH4VO3 and H40N10O41W12·xH2O were dissolved in oxalic solution. And then 4 g P25 was immersed into the obtained solution. The mixture was stirred for 2 h, dried at 110 °C in air overnight and calcined at 500 °C for 5 h. Finally, the catalyst was crushed and sieved into 40-60 meshes for the activity tests. 2.3 Reaction systems Activity tests of the series catalysts were conducted in the reaction system. 0.2 g catalyst was used for evaluation. The reactant gases contained 500 ppm NO, 500 ppm NH3, 5% O2 and N2 in balance. The total gas flow rate was 500 mL min−1, related to a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 150,000 mLg−1 h−1. The concentrations of NO, NO2, N2O and NH3 were recorded on a Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer. The NO x conversion (X), N2 selectivity (S) and NH3 conversion (N) could be calculated using the following equations: (1) X = 100 % × ( [ N O i n ] − [ N O o u t ] − [ N O 2 o u t ] ) / [ N O i n ] (2) S = 100 % × [ 1 − ( 2 × [ N 2 O o u t ] + [ N O 2 o u t ] ) / ( [ N O i n ] + [ N H 3 i n ] ) ] (3) N = 100 % × ( [ N H 3 i n ] − [ N H 3 o u t ] ) / [ N H 3 i n ] NH3 oxidation experiments were performed in the reaction system. A sample of 0.2 g was used. The reaction conditions were as follows: 500 ppm NH3, 5% O2 and N2 balanced gas. The GHSV was 150,000 mLg−1 h−1. The compositions of the tested gases were analyzed using a Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer. The NH3 conversion (N) could be calculated based on Eq. (3). Catalyst sulfur resistance tests were carried out in the reaction system. The compositions of the reactant gases were as follows: 500 pm NO, 500 ppm NH3, 500 ppm SO2, 5% O2 and balanced N2 at a flow rate of 1.2 L min−1. The GHSV was 240,000 mLg−1 h−1. The NO x conversion of the catalysts at certain time could be calculated according to Eq. (1). 2.4 Characterization of the samples XRD measurements were conducted on a Rigaku D/max 2550PC system using the CuKα radian source. Raman spectra of the series samples were recorded using a Renishaw inVia spectrometer with an Ar ion laser as the radian source under ambient conditions. N2 adsorption and desorption experiments were performed to study the textural properties of the series catalysts. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was adopted to calculate the catalyst specific surface areas. Catalyst pore size distributions were determined using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. XPS experiments were performed on an ESCALab220i-XL electron spectrometer using Al Kα radians. The binding energies of the series photoelectron peaks were calibrated using the C 1s line at 284.5 eV. NH3-TPD experiments were carried out on an automated catalyst characterization system (Micromeritics, model AutoChem II 2920). Each sample of 0.1 g was first pretreated at 300 °C in flowing Ar for 30 min. And then the tested sample was cooled to 60 °C and saturated with NH3 for 1 h. After that, the sample was flushed by Ar for 2 h to remove the physically adsorbed NH3. Finally, the sample was heated to 600 °C in Ar at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. NH3 signal was recorded using a mass spectrometer. H2-TPR profiles of the series catalysts were obtained on an automated catalyst characterization system (Micromeritics, model AutoChem II 2920). A sample of 50 mg was first pretreated under Ar atmosphere at 350 °C for 30 min. After that, the tested sample was cooled to 60 °C and then heated to 800 °C in H2 with a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1. The consumption of H2 was monitored using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In situ DRIFTS experiments were carried out on an FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet 6700). Each sample was first pretreated at 350 °C in N2 for 1 h to remove the adsorbed impurities. The background spectra were collected at certain temperatures (100 °C, 150 °C, 200 °C, 250 °C, 300 °C, 350 °C) in flowing N2. After that, 1000 ppm NH3 was purged into the cell and the sample was saturated with NH3 at 100 °C for 1 h. And then the sample was flushed by N2 to remove the physically adsorbed NH3. Finally, the sample was heated to certain temperatures in N2 to detect the variations in the surface NH3 species. All the spectra were obtained at a resolution of 4 cm−1 typically averaging 64 scans. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Catalyst performances 3.1.1 SCR activity The activity of the series catalysts in the temperature region of 150–450 °C was illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). Pure Fe support exhibits a poor activity. The NO x conversion of pure Fe support shows a slight upward tendency with increasing temperature, which reaches the highest value of ca. 40% at 250 °C. As the temperature further goes up, catalytic activity of pure Fe support begins to decrease. It should be noted that a negative NO x conversion is generated when the temperature is above 350 °C, which might be explained by the additional formation of NO x through the oxidation of NH3 over the pure Fe support. Upon the addition of HSiW, the NO x conversion value at a temperature higher than 250 °C obviously increases, suggesting that an improved high-temperature activity is obtained for the catalysts added with HSiW. Over 80% NO x conversion is observed in the temperature region between 250 °C and 450 °C when the HSiW content increases to 5% and 10%, while little change has taken place for the catalyst activity below 250 °C. Compared with the commercialized VW/Ti catalyst, a much higher low-temperature activity could be observed for 10% HSiW-Fe catalyst; the high NH3-SCR activity and the satisfactory N2 selectivity constitute the important characteristics of 10% HSiW-Fe catalyst in regards to practical utilizations (Fig. S1 in the online version at DOI: 10.1016/j.mcat.2018.01.029). Further increasing the HSiW content to 20%, a higher catalyst high-temperature activity could be in turn detected; over 90% NO x conversion is still present even at a high temperature of 450 °C. Additionally, it should be noted that a high HSiW content has a negative effect on the catalyst low-temperature activity. The NH3 conversion results are shown in Fig. 1(b), which could be used to demonstrate the behaviors of NH3 during the SCR reaction process. Given that the reaction temperature is lower than 250 °C, the NH3 conversion value of the catalysts is almost the same with the NO x conversion value, indicating that ammonia species mainly act as the reductant to react with NO at a relatively low-temperature region. As the temperature increases, the NO x conversion begins to be lower than the NH3 conversion; the NH3 conversion of the series catalysts reaches 100% above 350 °C, while the NO x conversion exhibits a downward trend in this temperature region. This finding indicates that ammonia species not only participate in the reaction with NO but also go through some side reactions such as being directly oxidized to NO x in the higher temperature region, which would be demonstrated in detail in the following sections. Fig. 1(c) illustrates the N2 selectivity of the series catalysts. In the case of pure Fe support, a relatively poor N2 selectivity could be observed, since the N2 selectivity value of pure Fe support is below 90% at a temperature higher than 300 °C. Adding HSiW leads to an obvious enhancement in the catalyst N2 selectivity. For 10% HSiW-Fe and 20% HSiW-Fe catalysts, over 93% N2 selectivity can be obtained in the whole temperature region. These results indicate that HSiW plays an important role in the catalyst activity and N2 selectivity; there exist some strong interactions between Fe support and HSiW. The relationship between the catalyst catalytic activity and structures would be investigated through the various characterizations.

The relationship between the catalyst catalytic activity and structures would be investigated through the various characterizations. Fig. S1 3.1.2 NH3 oxidation The NH3 oxidation results are presented in Fig. 2 , which might explain the declined NO x conversion of the series catalysts with the increase in the temperature. As is shown in Fig. 2(a), the NH3 conversion value of pure Fe support increases as the temperature goes up, which reaches above 90% at a temperature higher than 350 °C. Given the doping of HSiW, the oxidation of NH3 is inhibited in a certain extent; the NH3 conversion value of 10% HSiW-Fe and 20% HSiW-Fe catalysts is below 60% in the whole temperature region. Fig. 2(b)–(d) demonstrate the formation of NO, NO2 and N2O during the NH3 oxidation process. For pure Fe support, NO and NO2 constitute the main products in the NH3 oxidation cycle above 350 °C, the maximum values of which reach ca. 320 ppm and ca. 100 ppm at 450 °C respectively. This result reveals that the additional formation of NO x through the excess oxidation of NH3 could explain the negative NO x conversion of Fe support above 350 °C to some extent. After introducing HSiW, the formation amount of NO and NO2 decreases in different extent, which almost disappears as the HSiW content exceeds 5%. That might be an important reason for the excellent high-temperature activity of the HSiW-modified catalysts. Additionally, an inhibited formation behavior of N2O occurs with the increase in the HSiW content to 10% or more, which might explain the superior N2 selectivity of 10% HSiW-Fe and 20% HSiW-Fe catalysts at high-temperature regions. 3.1.3 Effect of SO2 SO2 remains one of the typical components in the flue gases, to which V2O5-free catalysts have been proved to be sensitive. Formation of sulfated active components mainly explains the poisoning behavior of V2O5-free catalysts by SO2 [3,10]. Therefore, the effect of SO2 addition on the SCR activity of the 10% HSiW-Fe catalyst should be explored, of which the results are shown in Fig. 3 . During the whole SO2-deactivation cycle, the NO x conversion slightly decreases and reaches a stable value of ca. 85%, indicating that this catalyst has an excellent SO2-tolerant ability. After the cessation of the purging of SO2 into the reaction system, the catalytic activity fully recovers, demonstrating that this inhibition effect is reversible. It seems that 10% HSiW-decorated Fe2O3 oxide might be a potential catalyst for the practical applications. 3.2 Physicochemical properties of the series catalysts 3.2.1 Physical properties The XRD patterns of the series catalysts are presented in Fig. 4 . Only Fe2O3 phase could be observed for the samples with the HSiW content lower than 20%, which suggests that HSiW is inherently amorphous in structure on the Fe support surface. Further increasing the HSiW content to 20%, pure HSiW phase begins to come out; this finding demonstrates that the loading of HSiW is beyond the theoretical monolayer coverage on the Fe support. Combined with the activity results in Fig. 1, it seems that the appearance of crystallite HSiW might explain the decreased NO x conversion of 20% HSiW-Fe catalyst below 250 °C to some extent. The specific surface areas and total pore volumes of the series catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . It could be concluded that textual properties would be not the main reason for the enhanced activity of the samples with a high HSiW content, since no obvious variations in the catalyst surface areas and total pore volumes are generated via introducing HSiW. Raman spectra of the series samples are shown in Fig. 5 . In the case of pure HSiW, the peaks at 1002 and 974 cm−1 could be attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of WO; the asymmetric stretching vibrations of W-O-W and the bending vibrations of Si-O-Si explain the appearance of the peaks at 924 and 546 cm−1, respectively [11–13]. For pure Fe support, the peaks centered at 212, 277, 390, 596 cm−1 are the characteristics of Fe2O3 phase [7]. The introduction of HSiW makes these peaks shift towards higher wavenumbers, suggesting that the Fe-O bond length of the HSiW-containing catalysts is some shorter than that of pure Fe support and some new bonds such as Fe-O-W bond might be in turn formed [14,15]. That is to say, HSiW sometimes interacts with Fe support and distortion of Fe2O3 lattice is caused through the doping of HSiW. As is previously mentioned, some changes have taken place in the physical structures of the catalysts upon the addition of HSiW, which might in turn lead to the different chemical properties, including acid and redox properties. That would be extensively explored in the following sections, through which the direct reasons for the various performances of the series catalysts would be uncovered. 3.2.2 Acid properties NH3-TPD profiles of the series catalysts are shown in Fig. 6 . For pure Fe support, no obvious NH3 desorption peaks are generated during the heat process, demonstrating that scanty acid sites on the pure Fe support surface could be available for the adsorption of NH3. By contrast, the intensity of the NH3 desorption peaks increases via introducing HSiW, suggesting that abundant acid sites are formed on the HSiW-added catalysts. Additionally, it seems that there exist two NH3 desorption peaks for the catalysts with the HSiW content of 5% or more. The first peak centered at ca. 209 °C would be related to NH3 adsorbed on the weak acid sites; the latter one at ca. 294 °C could be assigned to NH3 linked to the strong acid sites [16]. In situ DRIFTS experiments of NH3 adsorption were carried out at 100 °C to investigate the detailed acid properties of the series catalysts. Based on previous studies, characteristic IR peaks in the ranges of 1155–1220 cm−1 and 1600–1610 cm−1 could be attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric bending vibrations of ammonia species adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites [17]. The symmetric and asymmetric bending vibrations of NH4 + bonded to the Bronsted acid sites explain the presence of the IR peaks centered at 1668 and 1422 cm−1, respectively. The peaks at 3327, 3255 and 3164 cm−1 are related to the stretching vibrations of the N-H bond [6]. In the case of pure Fe support, only Lewis acid sites could be available for the adsorption of NH3. By contrast, Bronsted acid sites begin to come out as the HSiW content increases (Fig. 7 (a)). After calculating the ratio of the areas of the peaks indexed to NH4 + on the Bronsted acid sites and NH3 on the Lewis acid sites [14], it could be concluded that some variations has occurred in the distributions of the catalyst surface acid sites; Bronsted acid sites become the dominant acid sites for the catalysts with the HSiW content of 10% or more (Fig. 7(b)). In order to get insight into the thermal stability of ammonia species adsorbed on the catalyst surfaces, pure Fe support and 10% HSiW-Fe catalyst are chosen to explore the behaviors of ammonia species adsorbed on the Lewis and Bronsted acid sites during heating. As is mentioned above, characteristic IR peaks centered at 1182, 1156 and 1239 cm−1 are speculated to be NH3 coordinated on the Lewis acid sites; the band at 1419 cm−1 is the characteristics of NH4 + linked to the Bronsted acid sites [18]. As the temperature goes up, the intensity of the peaks for the adsorbed ammonia species decreases in different extent. Increasing the temperature to 300 °C or higher, no obvious peaks could be detected for pure Fe support, suggesting that ammonia species adsorbed on the Fe surface are fully consumed in this temperature region (Fig. 8 (a)). While for 10% HSiW-Fe catalyst, certain amount of ammonia species is still present on the catalyst surface even at a temperature of 350 °C (Fig. 8(b)). Combined with the calculated relative concentration values of ammonia species on the Lewis and Bronsted acid sites at different temperatures, it could be concluded that ammonia species on the Fe support surface possess a lower thermal stability than those on the 10% HSiW-Fe catalyst surface (Fig. 8(c)), which is consistent with NH3-TPD profiles in Fig. 6 that an obvious NH3 signal could be still detected at a temperature higher than 350 °C for 10% HSiW-Fe catalyst while the absence of NH3 signal occurs for Fe support in this temperature region. And compared with NH3 adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites, a larger decline scope of the relative concentration value of NH4 + on the Bronsted acid sites could be observed for 10% HSiW-Fe catalyst. This finding suggests that ammonia species on the Lewis acid sites own a higher thermal stability than those on the Bronsted acid sites, which is consistent with the results mentioned in previous studies [14]. As a consequence, the addition of HSiW leads to an obvious enhancement in the total acidity of the catalysts. The as-introduced acid sites would be responsible for the promoted adsorption behavior of reductant NH3, which would in turn have a positive effect on the SCR reactions in the higher temperature region to some extent. 3.2.3 Redox properties H2-TPR profiles of the series samples are illustrated in Fig. 9 . For pure Fe support, two reduction peaks are generated during the heat process. The reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 constitutes the first peak centered at ca. 390 °C, while the latter one at ca. 680 °C is related to the transformation of Fe3O4 to FeO [8,19]. By contrast, adding HSiW makes the reduction peak of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 shift towards higher temperatures, suggesting that there exist some synergetic interactions between HSiW and Fe support and oxygen species on the HSiW-modified catalysts exhibit a lower reducibility. XPS experiments were conducted to uncover the detailed atom environment of the series Fe-based catalysts. Fig. 10 (a) illustrates the catalyst Fe 2p XPS spectra. According to the binding energies of Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2, together with the Fe 2p3/2 satellite peak, it could be concluded that Fe atoms exist in the +3 oxidation state as in Fe2O3, which is consistent with the XRD patterns in Fig. 4 to some extent [20]. By comparison, the binding energies of the Fe 2p photoelectron peaks increase in different extent through introducing HSiW, indicating that the electron cloud density around the Fe atoms decreases by interacting with HSiW [21]. As for W atoms, the generated two intensive peaks could be assigned to W 4f5/2 and W 4f7/2, respectively, which correspond well with W6+ [22]. Combined with the XRD patterns in Fig. 4, it seems that the ratio [(W species interacting with Fe2O3)/(total W species)] increases with the decrease in the HSiW loading amount [23]. And the decline in the binding energies of the W 4f peaks for the catalysts with a low HSiW content illustrates the existence of electronic inductive effect between Fe and W atoms [24]. The O 1 s photoelectron peaks are presented in Fig. 10(c). The obtained two sub-peaks after deconvolution indicate that there exist various oxygen species on the catalyst surfaces. The peak in the range of 530.9–531.7 eV could be assigned to surface chemical adsorbed oxygen species (Oα ), which contain O2 2− and O−; the other peak ranging between 529.3 and 530.1 eV can be related to lattice oxygen (Oβ ) [25]. After calculating the relative concentration ratio of Oα , this value decreases as the HSiW loading amount increases. Additionally, the O 1 s peaks shift towards higher binding energies as the HSiW content increases. These results indicate that oxygen species on the HSiW-rich catalysts own the least electron cloud density and formation of catalyst surface vacancies is inhibited resulting from the interactions between Fe support and HSiW, which also exerts a negative effect on the activation of surface oxygen species [26,27]. That is to say, catalyst redox properties are weakened by doping HSiW, which is consistent with the H2-TPR results in Fig. 9. As a result, the oxidation behavior of reductant NH3 is impeded in a certain extent with the addition of HSiW, which explains the enhanced high-temperature SCR activity of the high HSiW content catalysts to some extent. 3.3 Discussions According to the mechanisms of the SCR reactions, it seems that acid properties play an important role in the catalyst high-temperature activity, for the first step in this reaction is the adsorption of NH3 on the catalyst surface acid sites [1]. NH3-TPD profiles in Fig. 6 and FTIR spectra of NH3 adsorption in Figs. 7 and 8 illustrate that limited acid sites could be available for the adsorption of NH3 for pure Fe support and ammonia species adsorbed on the Fe support surface is easy to be consumed with increasing temperature through desorption or oxidation by the catalyst redox sites. That constitutes the main barrier to the increase in the NO x conversion of Fe support as the temperature increases to 300 °C or higher to some extent. And it is worth noting that some side reactions including the oxidation of NH3 to NO x would be expected to occur at higher temperatures, which is closely related to the reactivity of catalyst surface oxygen species [28]. H2-TPR profiles in Fig. 9 and XPS results in Fig. 10 demonstrate that abundant reactive oxygen species are generated on the pure Fe support surface, which has a promotion effect on the oxidation of NH3 to NO x at high-temperature regions. In other words, NH3 is prone to participating in the reaction with O2 to produce NO x , instead of functioning as the reductant to react with NO x to form harmless N2 and H2O over the pure Fe support. The additional formed NO x increases the concentration of NO x in the simulated flue gases and decreases the amount of reductant NH3 to react with NO x . As a result, a negative NO x conversion is generated for pure Fe support above 300 °C. By contrast, some variations in the chemical properties of the catalysts occur with the introduction of HSiW. The lowered amount and reducibility of catalyst surface reactive oxygen species exert an inhibitory effect on the occurrence of these side reactions related to the oxidation of NH3 to NO x . Besides, the appearance of abundant acid sites would help to leave most ammonia species available to act as the reductant and react with NO x at a high-temperature region. As a result, a wide operation temperature window is obtained for the catalysts decorated by HSiW. As the HSiW content increases to 20%, the strong and excessive adsorption of NH3, together with the weakened redox properties would have a negative effect on the activation process of the adsorbed NH3 and NO x in a certain extent [10,29], hence resulting in a decreased NO x conversion below 300 °C. That is to say, the balance of the redox and acid properties plays a decisive role in the SCR activity of the catalysts [30]. 4 Conclusions In this study, a series of HSiW-modified Fe2O3 catalysts are synthesized using the precipitation method. Over 80% NO x conversion is obtained in the temperature region between 250 and 450 °C for the catalysts with the HSiW content of 5% and 10%. The relationship between the physicochemical properties and performances of the series catalysts is established. Abundant acid sites are introduced with doping HSiW, which promotes the adsorption of reductant NH3 on the catalysts at high-temperature regions. Moreover, adding HSiW lowers the amount and reducibility of catalyst surface reactive oxygen species, which has a negative effect on the oxidation of NH3 to NO x at higher temperatures to some extent. Therefore, most ammonia species are prone to participating in the reaction with NO x instead of being directly oxidized to NO x in the higher temperature region for the HSiW-decorated catalysts; and it could be concluded that the balance of the acid and redox properties constitutes the main reason for the superior activity of the catalysts with a high HSiW content. In addition, SO2 exerts a slight and reversible inhibition effect on the activity of the catalyst at 300 °C, suggesting that HSiW-modified Fe2O3 oxide might be a promising catalyst in practical applications.

        "dc:description": "A series of H4SiW12O40-modified Fe2O3 catalysts were synthesized using the precipitation method. Over 80% NO x conversion was obtained in the temperature region of 250–450 °C for the catalysts with the H4SiW12O40 content of 5% and 10%. The relationship between the physicochemical properties and performances of the series catalysts was established. Abundant acid sites were introduced with doping H4SiW12O40, which promoted the adsorption of reductant NH3 on the catalysts at high-temperature regions. Moreover, adding H4SiW12O40 lowered the amount and reducibility of catalyst surface reactive oxygen species, which inhibited the oxidation of NH3 to NO x at higher temperatures to some extent. Thus, most ammonia species were prone to participating in the reaction with NO x instead of being directly oxidized to NO x in the higher temperature region over the H4SiW12O40-decorated catalysts. And it could be concluded that the balance of the acid and redox properties constituted the main reason for the superior activity of the high H4SiW12O40 content catalysts. Additionally, SO2 exerted a slight and reversible inhibition effect on the catalyst activity at 300 °C, suggesting that HSiW-modified Fe2O3 oxide might be a promising catalyst in practical applications.",
