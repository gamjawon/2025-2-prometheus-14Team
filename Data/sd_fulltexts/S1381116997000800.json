Kita-ku, Nagoya 462, Japan b Daido Institute of Technology, Daido-cho, Minami-ku, Nagoya 457, Japan Received 17 December 1996; accepted 3 April 1997 Abstract The hydrogenation of CO, was studied on disulfides of molybdenum and tungsten by comparison with that on the group V111 metals of Fe, Co, and Ni supported on A1203. The hydrogenation activity was lower on the disulfides on a per active site of catalyst basis than on the transition metals, however, the selective reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction (COz + H 2 - CO + H z0) was observed on the disulfides. The selectivity was close to ca. 100% in the reaction conditions examined. The rate was expressed by the equation: r = kPC0=o'73PHz 6 on the disulfides, and the activation energy was ca. 18.0-19.1 kcal mol-~. The disulfides exhibited little activities for the hydrogenation of CO (viz. CO + 3H2 - CH4 + H20) and also for the disproportionation of CO (viz. 2C0 __' C + COZ). These results were in contrast to those for the transition metals where high activities were observed for both reactions, suggesting that the retardation of C-O bond cleavage in the CO molecule produced by the COZ hydrogenation must be the cause for the selective hydrogenation of COZ to CO on the disulfides. The effect of supports on the hydrogenation of COZ was also investigated for MOS2. The reaction rate on a per active site of catalyst basis was not influenced by the supports, suggesting that the COZ-HZ reaction is insensitive to the morphology of MOS2 supported on metal oxides. 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

(1), the reaction of carbon monoxide and water to produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen, is frequently used in industries in conjunction with the production of pure hydrogen via the steam reforming of hydrocarbons Eq.

PIIS1381-1169(97)00080-0 (2) On the other hand, the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) Eq. (3), the reaction of carbon dioxide and hydrogen to produce carbon monoxide and water, is also a reaction of considerable industrial importance: COZ+HZ-NCO+HZO (3) The RWGS reaction technology is recently expected in industries in the production of valuable CO from cheap COZ using hydrogen. Carbon monoxide is valuable and necessary in many T. Osaki et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 125 (1997) 63-71 chemical companies. In the partial oxidation of asphalt, coal, and heavy oil, hydrogen is also produced with CO, however, it is not always utilized commercially. The hydrogenation of C02 usually reaches the production of CH4 on transition metal catalysts at atmospheric pressure [1-4]. It is considered that the methanation of C02 is the conversion of C02 to CO via the RWGS reaction, followed by the methanation of CO, viz. C02 - CO - CH4 (4) Methane is less valuable than CO because methane is a stable molecule and its reactivity is very low, while CO is an important raw material for many chemicals such as formaldehyde, methanol, and acetic acid. The RWGS reaction may open a route for the production of valuable CO from C02 using hydrogen produced as a by-product. For such purpose, it is necessary to develop a high-performance catalyst for producing CO in the C02 hydrogenation. Aside from the industrial requirement, our interest in the RWGS reaction grew out of the study C02 reforming of methane to produce CO and HZ Eq. (5): CH4 + C02 - 2C0 + 2H2 (5) The RWGS reaction can occur whenever C02 and H 2 are present in a reacting mixture. In the C02 reforming of methane, the H2 product easily reacts with C02 feed via the RWGS reaction and as a result, the HZ/CO ratio often becomes less than unity due to a contribution of the RWGS reaction [5]. The WGS and/or RWGS reactions are readily catalyzed by both metals and metal oxides. Prichard and Hinshelwood studied the kinetics of the RWGS reaction over platinum in 1925 [6]. For both WGS and RWGS reactions, Amenomiya investigated the kinetics of the reactions by using infrared spectroscopy, and was able to identify the presence of formate ion in both reactions [7,8]. He concluded that the formate ion was an intermediate in the reaction, viz. depending on the direction of the WGS reaction, formate ion is decomposed into either C02 and H 2 or CO and H 20. Thus, many studies on the kinetics of WGS and/or RWGS reactions on metals or metal oxides were reported [9-13], however, only a few studies were focused on the WGS and/or RWGS reactions over metal sulfde catalysts [14]. The metal sulfides would be durable against sulfur atom involved in coal, heavy oil, and asphalt. In the present paper, a detailed study of specific activity, selectivity, and dependence of reaction rate on partial pressures of both reactants for the hydrogenation of C02 over MOS2 and WS2 was made by comparing with that over A1203-supported Fe, Co, and Ni catalysts. In addition to this, the effect of supports on the hydrogenation of C02 was also studied for MOS2. 2. Experimental 2.1. Characterization of molybdenum and tungsten disulfides X-ray diffraction of the disulfides was measured using Rigaku RAD-1VC (CuKa, 30 kV, 30 mA). BET surface area of the disulfides was examined with an N2 adsorption apparatus (Carlo Erba Sorptomatic 1800). Chemical analysis of the disulfides was carried out by use of a sulfur-carbon analyzer and an oxygen-nitrogen analyzer (LECO). 2.2. Catalyst preparation and reagents The disulfides of molybdenum and tungsten were respectively prepared from (NH4)2MOS4 and (NH4)2WS4 (both from Aldrich, the purity; 99.97% and 99.9%, respectively) by decomposing them in a stream of hydrogen (20 ml min') at 773 K for 2 h. Supported metal catalysts were prepared by impregnating an A1203 with an aqueous solution of Fe(N03)2 - 614201 Co(N03)2 - 6H20, and Ni(N03)2 - 6H20 (Wako chemicals, the purity 99.0%, 97%, and 98%, T. Osaki et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 125 (1997) 63-77 respectively). The alumina support, a reference catalyst (JRC-ALO-4; the purity, Fez03: 0.01%, SiO, : 0.01 %, and Na20: 0.01 %; the surface area, 177 m'- g-') supplied by The Catalyst Society of Japan, was used by crashing it to 300-500 nm fragments prior to impregnation. The impregnated samples were dried at 383 K for 24 h followed by being calcined at 773 K for 3 h. Before use, the catalysts were reduced in a hydrogen stream (20 ml min-') at 773 K for 2 h. The metal loading was 20 wt%. Supported MoS, catalysts were prepared as follows: the metal oxides (A1.03, Ti021 Si0.SIO,-A1203, MgO, HY-zeorite, and Hmordenite; supplied by The Catalyst Society of Japan) were impregnated with an aqueous solution of (NH4)6Mo70,4 - 4Hz0, followed by being dried and subsequently being calcined at 773 K for 3 h. The Mo03 loading on a metal oxide was 20 wt%. Then, a mixture of H,,S and H, diluted by N, (H-,S: Hz: Nz = 2.5: 50: 47.5, 40 ml min-') was flowed over the supported molybdenum trioxides at 673 K for 3 h. Hydrogen (99.999%) was purified by passage through a silica gel column after converting a very small amount of oxygen present (less than 1 ppm) to water. Helium (99.995%) was also purified by passing through a gas-purifier (Japan Pure Hydrogen, MCN-005) to remove oxygen, and then through a molecular sieve trap to remove water. CO,, (ca. 99.9%) was used without further purification. 2.3. Steady state H,-CO, reaction The hydrogenation of CO,, was investigated in a conventional flow apparatus operating at atmospheric pressure. The reactor, made of a 4 mm i.d. quartz tube, contained a packed bed consisting of a catalyst and quartz glass wool. Before admitting H 2-COZ gases, the catalyst was reduced with hydrogen under the conditions described above. After the reduction, a mixture of CO, and H, was introduced to the catalyst at a constant flow rate. The reactions were carried out under the conditions of a differential reac- 65 tor. After steady state, the products were analyzed by a gaschromatography (Shimadzu GC 8A) with a thermal conductivity detector using active carbon as the separation column. 2.4. CO and NO chemisorption Chemisorption behavior of CO onto the disulfides prepared from the ammonium compounds and also onto the transition metals was investigated by a pulse technique using helium as a carrier gas. After reducing the catalyst in a stream of hydrogen followed by purging with helium, a constant volume of CO (0.54 ml) was pulsed onto the catalyst in helium carrier gas (30 ml min-') at 298 K for several times. Chemisorption behavior of NO onto the supported MOS2 catalysts was also examined by a pulse method using helium as a carrier gas. After preparing the supported MoS, catalysts according to the method described- above, a constant volume of NO (1.22 ml) was pulsed onto the catalysts in helium carrier gas (40 ml min-') at 298 K for several times. 2.5. CO hydrogenation and CO disproportiona- tion Hydrogenation of CO was investigated by a pulse method. After reducing the catalyst with hydrogen, a constant volume of CO (0.54 ml) was pulsed onto the catalyst in hydrogen carrier gas (30 ml min'). The reaction was carried out in the temperature range 523-673 K, and the effluent gases were analyzed by a gaschromatography (Shimadzu, GC-3BT) with a thermal conductivity detector. Active carbon was used for the separation column. Disproportionation of CO was investigated in helium carrier gas. After the reduction of a catalyst, helium was admitted into the reactor at a constant flow rate (30 ml min'). After the steady state, a constant volume of CO (0.54 ml) was pulsed onto the catalyst via the helium carrier gas, and the effluent gases containing CO and CO, were analyzed by a gaschromatog- 66 T. Osaki et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 125 (1997) 63-71 raphy (Shimadzu, GC-3BT). Active carbon was used for the separation column. 3. Results z 3.1. Characterization of metal disulfides = The metal sulfide catalysts prepared from their ammonium precursors showed broad diffraction peaks, and their diffraction patterns could be assigned to those for MOS2 and WS2, respectively. Chemical analysis also showed that the ratio, S/M (M = Mo or W), of the sulfides was 1.94 and 1.96 for MOS2 and WS2, respectively. The BET surface area was 27.9 and 41.1 m2 g-1 for MOS2 and WS 2, respectively. 3.2. Activity and selectivity for H2-C02 The information about CO adsorption on the catalysts is shown in Table 1. As for the supported metal catalysts, the dispersion of the metals, the particle size of the metals calculated from the dispersion, and the crystallite size of the metals calculated from XRD peak-width are also shown for comparison. As appropriate for the metal catalysts, one chemisorbed CO molecular is assumed to be presented on one surface metal atom. In the same way, although precise active sites for the disulfides are not clearly identified, it is also assumed that one chemisorbed CO is presented on one surface active site of the disulfides.

As shown, (1) the disulfide catalysts exhibited lower activities than the metal catalysts, (2) among the metal catalysts, the activity order was Co/A1203 > Ni/A1203 = Fe/A1203, while (3) between the disulfides, the activity was a little higher for MoS2 than for WS2. From the slopes of the straight lines, activation energies are calculated and are presented in Table 1. The activation energies on the disulfides are almost the same as those observed on the transition metals. Fig. 2(a)-(e) show the effect of time factor (W/F) on the hydrogenation of C02.

Fig. 4 shows the rates of COZ conversion as a function of partial pressures of both COZ and HZ. The rate for COZ-H2, Nco2/s-1, is expressed by the following equation: Nco2/s 1 = kP~o2PH2 where Pco and PH, are the partial pressures of (6) T. Osaki et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 125 (1997) 63-71 CO2 and H2, respectively, and a and b are the reaction orders with respect to the partial pressures of CO2 and HZ, respectively. From the slopes of the straight lines shown in Fig. 4, the reaction orders are calculated and are presented in Table 1. On all the catalysts, the orders are positive with respect to both reactants. The order is larger for the partial pressure of HZ than for that of COZ on Ni/A1203 and Co/A1203. On the other hand, the order is larger for the partial pressure of CO2 than for that of HZ on Fe/A1203, MOS2, and WS2. On Fe/Al 03 catalyst, the order with respect to COZ partial pressure is significantly large compared with that on other catalysts. 3.4. C-O bond breaking in CO molecule Hydrogenation of CO was carried out on all the catalysts so that the activity for the subsequent hydrogenation of CO produced by the COZ hydrogenation could be revealed. The results are shown in Table 2. The activity for the CO hydrogenation was markedly lower on the disulfides than on the transition metals. The activity order on a per gram of catalyst basis was in the following: Co/A1203 > Ni/A1203 > Fe/A1203 > > WSz > MOS2. The sequence of which seemed to be much related with the selectivity to CO in the COZ hydrogenation. For comparing the ease of C-O bond breaking in CO molecular between on the transition metals and on the disulfides, the disproportiona- Table 2 Hydrogenation and disproportionation of CO Catalyst (catalyst weight) Hydrogenation Disproportionation of CO (%) of CO (%) 573 K623 K 523 K 9.0 b Ni/A1,0; (29.7 mg) 28.8 61.1 Co/A1203 (29.9 mg) 42.8 95.0 Fe/A'203 (29.1 mg) 14.3 32.4 MOS, (100 mg) 0.06 0.111 WS, (100 mg) 0.11 0.54 0.36 At 673 K. b 50 mg. 69 Table 3 NO chemisorption behavior on supported MOS2 catalysts Supports' AIZO3 (JRC-ALO-4) SiOZ (JRC-SIO-4) TiO, (JRC-TIO-3) Mg0 (JRC-MGO-I) SiO=-AlZ03 (JRC-SAL-2) H-mordenite (JRC-Z-HM 10) HY-zeorite (JRC-Z-HY 4.8) Surface NO area chemisorption (m z number g-~) (bkmol 177 347 40 55 560 187 663 107.1 55.2 28.7 59.7 31.8 159.2 14.7 a JRC supports were supplied by The Catalyst Society of Japan. tion of CO Eq.

The CO disproportionation is less marked on the disulfide than on the Ni/A1203.

As shown, the rate for H 2-C02 was not influenced by the supports. The activation energy was ca. 18.2 kcal mol-1 for all the supported MOS2 catalysts examined. 4. Discussions 4.1. Suppression of C-O bond cleavage in CO produced by COZ hydrogenation MOS2 and WS2 showed lower activities for the C02-H2 than the transition metals on a per active site of catalyst basis. However, the selective hydrogenation of C02 to CO was observed on the disulfides. The methanation of C02 was almost unobserved on the disulfides even if the contact time, W/F, increased. It is reported that the hydrogenation of both CO and C02 gives almost the same reaction rate and also the same activation energy on transition metals [2,15]. This indicates that both reactions proceed through a common intermediate species. The hydrogenation of CO to CH4 must go through at least two steps; i.e., (i) C-O bond cleavage, and then (ii) hydrogenation of the surface carbon species. In order to investigate the activity for the C-O bond cleavage in CO molecule, the hydrogenation of CO was carried out on the disulfides and was compared with that on the transition metals. The disulfides showed lower activities for the hydrogenation of CO than the transition metals. This strongly suggests that the subsequent hydrogenation of CO produced by the C02 hydrogenation is suppressed on the disulfides. The suppression of C-O bond breaking was also evidenced by the CO disproportionation, for which a significantly low activity was observed on the disulfide in contrast to on the transition metal catalyst. The apparent activation energy on the transition metals examined in this study was within the range found by other authors [4,10]. The apparent activation energies on the disulfides were very close to those obtained on these transition metals. Although it was reported that a nonlinear relation was observed between In Ncoz/s-1 and InPHz (or PC0Z) for Si02-supported Ni catalyst [2], the linear relationships were obtained for the transition metals and also for the disulfides under the present experimental conditions. From the dependence of reaction rate on the partial pressures of both reactants, the catalysts were classified for convenience into two groups; (a) Ni/A1203 and Co/A1203, (b) Fe/A1203, MOS2, and WS2. On the former catalysts, the reaction order with respect to the partial pressure of C02 was smaller than that of H2, while the reaction order with respect to the partial pressure of H 2 was smaller than that of C02 on the latter catalysts. The methanation of C02 was marked on Ni and Co catalysts, while it was suppressed on Fe, MOS2, and WS2 catalysts. Taking into account these results, it seems that moderately strong adsorption of H2 rather than C02 gives a favorable condition for the hydrogenation of C02 to CO. In other words, for designing a catalyst for the selective conversion of C02 to CO, the catalyst surface should have a relatively strong affinity for H2 rather than C02 so that the subsequent methanation of CO produced by the C02 hydrogenation would be suppressed. Further study is necessary for revealing the relation between the reaction orders and the selectivity to CO. 4.2. Insensitive to MoS2 structure The effect of supports on the hydrogenation of C02 was also investigated over the supported MOS2 catalysts on the basis of rate per active site. It is reported for the supported metal catalysts that the turnover frequency (the rate per active site) is often dependent [ 11,12] or independent [13] on the particle size of the metals. The former is so-called `structure-sensitive', T. Osaki et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 125 (1997) 63-71 while the latter is the `structure-insensitive' proposed by Boudart [14]. The structure-sensitive is caused by an increase of the collective atoms which are present on the top or the edge of the particle upon decreasing the particle size of the metal. The structure-sensitive is also observed on metal oxide or metal sulfide catalysts [1519]. The striking result of our investigation is that the specific activity of the supported MoS,, is independent on the nature of the supports as shown in Fig. 5. Since the surface active site of the supported MoS, varies by one order of magnitude, in the number range ca. 15-160 Amol g-1 for the supported MOS2 catalysts, almost the same specific activities observed for the H,,-CO., reaction suggest that the reaction is insensitive to the MOS, structure. 5. Conclusions The hydrogenation of CO2 on the disulfides of molybdenum and tungsten was investigated. The disulfides exhibited lower activities than the transition metals of Fe, Co, and Ni supported on A1203, however, the selective hydrogenation of CO, to CO via the RWGS reaction was observed. moderately strong affinity for H , rather than for COz was observed on MOS2 and WS, catalysts. The cause for the selective hydrogenation of COz to CO was found to be due to the suppression of C-O bond breaking in 71 CO molecule produced by the COZ hydrogenation. The reaction rate on a per active site of catalyst basis was not influenced by the sup- ports for MOS2. References [1] G.D. Weatherbee, C.H. Bartholomew, J. Catal. 68 (1981) 67. [2] G.D.

The hydrogenation activity was lower on the disulfides on a per active site of catalyst basis than on the transition metals, however, the selective reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O) was observed on the disulfides. The selectivity was close to ca. 100% in the reaction conditions examined. The rate was expressed by the equation: r = kP 0.61–0.73 CO2 P 0.36 H2 on the disulfides, and the activation energy was ca. 18.0–19.1 kcal mol−1. The disulfides exhibited little activities for the hydrogenation of CO (viz. CO + 3H2 → CH4 + H2O) and also for the disproportionation of CO (viz. 2CO → C + CO2). These results were in contrast to those for the transition metals where high activities were observed for both reactions, suggesting that the retardation of CO bond cleavage in the CO molecule produced by the CO2 hydrogenation must be the cause for the selective hydrogenation of CO2 to CO on the disulfides. The effect of supports on the hydrogenation of CO2 was also investigated for MoS2. The reaction rate on a per active site of catalyst basis was not influenced by the supports, suggesting that the CO2H2 reaction is insensitive to the morphology of MoS2 supported on metal oxides.
