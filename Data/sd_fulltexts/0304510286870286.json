FILIPA RIBEIRO, F. RAMOA RIBEIRO Grupo de Estudos de Catdlise Heterogenea, Institute Superior Tecnico, Av Rovisco Pais, 1096 Lisbon Codex (Portugal) P. DUFRESNE and C. MARCILLY Institut Francois du Petrole, BP 311, Rueil Malmaison (France) (Received June 3,1985, accepted September 4,1985) Summary The disproportionation of toluene was carried out on a dealummated Ni H mordenite and the influence of nickel poisoning with sulphur or lead was studied. Ni H mordenite exhibits medium or rather low selectivity in aromatics and fairly good stability. The poisoning of Ni H mordenite with sulphur or lead induces a similar increase of both the selectivity in aromatics and the stability of the catalyst. Neither sulphur nor lead modifies hydrogenating activity, although they show a high toxicity to hydrogenolysis activity. Sulphur increases the disproportionation activity of Ni H mordenite; this can be attributed to an interaction of sulphur with the acid support, converting Lewis acid sites into Bronsted acid sites. Lead has an opposite effect, which can be explained by an increase in the size of the metallic Pb/Ni particles which probably thus restricts access of toluene to the acid sites. Introduction Toluene disproportionation is a reaction of industrial interest, since its products, benzene and xylenes, are essential raw materials for the petro- chemical industry. It is an monofunctional acid reaction, in which mordenite [1-3] shows high catalytic activity; however this catalyst undergoes rapid deactivation due to coke formation. In order to improve catalytic stability, a hydrogenating function was associated with the already existing acid function. This hydrogenating func- tion is provided by a transition metal aimed at restricting coke formation and, therefore, catalyst deactivation. 0304-5102/86/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 228 One of the metals most commonly used for this purpose is nickel, which exhibits a strong hydrogenatmg activity thus decreasing the selectivity in aromatics. The purpose of this work is to study the modification of the hydro - genating function of Ni H mordenite by the introduction of a second metal (lead), or by the sulphuration of nickel, in toluene disproportionation. The acid function had been previously optimized. Experimental A Ni H mordenite catalyst was prepared by the following sequence of operations: (1) The NH4\"'\"M form was obtained from a large pore sodium mordenite (900 Na Zeolon from Norton), by ion exchange with an ammonium nitrate solution. (2) Combined thermal-acid treatment was carried out in order to ob- tain the dealuminated H-mordenite (HM) form (atomic ratio Si/Al = 12.6). (3) Nickel was introduced in the cationic form, by ion exchange. (4) Calcination at 500 C, for 2 h in a dry air stream, was then followed by reduction at 450 C for 3 h under a hydrogen pressure of 20 bar. Modification of the hydrogenating function was attempted by pre- paring the bimetallic catalyst Pb/Ni HM, and also by introducing sulphur on the Ni HM. The technique of sulphuration comprised the addition of dimethyl disulphide (0.12 wt.%) to the toluene under two different sets of conditions, to obtain two different catalysts. The first sulphuration was carried out after the reduction of the catalyst, by injection of the sulphur- ized load for 4.5 h under a pressure of 20 bar, molar ratio Hz/toluene = 4, space velocity of 5 h~1 and a temperature of 300 C; the second sulphuration was carried out simultaneously with the reduction, starting the injection of the sulphurized load at 100 C with a stepwise increase in temperature up to 300 C and maintaining all other above conditions. In both cases, the catalysts were cooled, maintaining the same hydrogen pressure and also the sulphurized load to prevent catalyst contact with hydrogen at high temperatures. Conversely, the catalysts were heated and pure toluene was introduced at low temperature. During the catalyst test, the sulphurized load was reintroduced at regular time intervals, in order to maintain a constant sulphur content in the catalysts. These two different catalysts are referred to hereafter as Ni-HM-S(l) and Ni HM-S(2). The contents in nickel and lead were determined by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. All catalysts showed a nickel content of 1.1 wt.% and in the Pb/Ni HM sample, lead content was 1.55 wt.%. Characterization of the acidic function was performed by temperature- programmed desorption of ammonia [4, 5] and the metallic function by electron probe microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The catalytic reactions were carried out in a fixed bed continuous reactor (weight of catalyst = 20 g) under a pressure of 20 bar, molar ratio 229 Hz/toluene = 4 and variable temperature, in order to obtain toluene conver- sions either lower than 10%, with space velocities of 5 h~1, or between 40 and 50%, with space velocities of 1.5 h~1. The study of the catalytic activity was performed by beginning the tests at higher temperature and decreasing it progesssively within pre-established conversion limits. To check any possible change of activity after the tests at variable temperature, the catalysts were tested again at the initial conditions of temperature. With the purpose of analysing catalytic stability, after the first set of tests the mordenites were aged for 6 h at 520 C, under 20 bar pressure, molar ratio Hz/toluene = 4 and a space velocity of 5 h~1, so that coking would occur. The coke content of the catalysts was determined by elemental microanalysis. The liquid condensates and the gaseous effluents were analysed by GLC (50 m CP SIL 5 capillary column). Results Physicochemical characterization of catalysts The existence of acid sites of high strength was confirmed by tem- perature-programmed desorption of ammonia. The macroscopic distribution of metals along the catalyst pellets (Fig. 1) was determined by electron probe microscopy, the homogeneous distribution of lead and of nickel being equally evident. Fig. 1. Distribution of nickel and lead for Pb/Ni HM, by electron probe microscopy. The catalysts were also investigated by means of transmission electron microscopy, and in the Ni HM evidence of metallic particles of different sizes (from 9 to 150 A), and also of some agglomerates (300 - 800 -1200 A), appeared after reduction. The Pb/Ni HM catalyst showed metallic particles with sizes between 24 and 700 A, whose nature was very difficult to identify. 230 These results confirm the great difficulty experienced by some authors [6, 7] in getting small nickel particles of narrow size distribution inside the zeolites. Catalytic tests Catalytic activity Figure 2 shows the total conversion of toluene (disproportionation plus secondary reactions) as a function of temperature for the different catalysts. The Pb/Ni HM catalyst is the least active, and the Ni HM-S(2) shows an activity slightly higher than Ni HM and Ni-HM-S(l) catalysts. 70 50 - 40 - 30 - ONiHM AN|HM-S(1> A NlHM-S(2) Pb/NlHM 260 420 310 300 340 Temperature ( C) Fig. 2. Toluene conversion as a function of the reaction temperature on Ni H mordenite, sulphurized Ni H mordenite and Pb/Ni H mordenite catalysts, for two space velocities (WHSV), The difference between the results of the two tests with the sulphurized nickel catalysts shows the influence of the nickel electronic state in resisting sulphur poisoning. According to the sulphuration conditions in Ni HM-S(2), sulphur adsorption was begun over ionic nickel, since the temperature at which nickel reduction begins to take place (200 - 250 C) [8, 9] is greater than that used in the test, while in the case of Ni-HM-S(l), the adsorption of sulphur was carried out over reduced nickel. Selectivity The great change in catalytic behaviour, due to the modification of the metallic function, in Ni H mordenite catalysts resulted fundamentally in an increase of selectivity in aromatics, as can be seen in Fig. 3. The catalysts with sulphurized nickel and, in particular Pb/Ni HM, showed much better selectivity than Ni HM.

Yield of non -aromatic compounds as a function of the toluene conversion on N1 H mordenite, sulphurized Ni H mordenite and Pb/Ni H mordenite catalysts: (a) before ageing (b) after ageing 232 one can conclude that, after ageing, Ni HM became less selective, while Pb/Ni HM and both sulphurized nickel catalysts retained approximately the same selectivity. This fact may indicate an irreversible adsorption of sulphur over nickel which withstands the high temperature at which ageing was performed. The stability of the bond between sulphur and nickel can be evaluated by the reproducibility of results: alongside normal tests with pure toluene, some runs with sulphurized toluene were performed and no change was noticed, which proves that the sulphur content of the catalyst remained constant. Analysis of Fig. 4 shows an important difference in the behaviour of the metallic functions of Pb/Ni HM, Ni-HM-S(l) and Ni HM-S(2) from the point of view of hydrogenolysis activity; the presence of lead and sulphur greatly decreases the formation of Ci and C; products. On the other hand, analysis of the hydrogenating activity of the metal- lic function based on conversion in ethylbenzene for all the catalysts, operating at total conversion of toluene between 40 and 50% shows that percentages of ETB in Cs aromatics were achieved ranging from 1 to 1.5%. No change in these values was noticed after ageing of the catalysts. (I 51 0 NiHM A NiHM.Sd) A NiHM-S(2l Pb/NiHM u + m Jn U 41 + u o 30 21 30 40 51 60 70 Toluane conversion (%) Fig. 4.

In Table 1 we present the values of the increases m temperature re- quired, after ageing, to attain toluene conversions similar to those obtained from the samples initially (Fig. 2). The stability order obtained confirms the positive effect of the poi- soning of nickel by sulphur and lead. Table 2 shows the values of coke contents in the catalysts after the tests; a remarkable decrease of coke content in both sulphurized Ni HM catalysts and Pb/Ni HM, compared with Ni HM, can be noted. In all cases, carbon analyses were performed after the catalysts had been treated for 1 h at 450 C, under a strong hydrogen flow.

However, promotion of second- ary reactions, namely hydrocracking and hydrogenolysis, by metallic nickel leads to intolerable losses in aromatics m the range of industrial operating 234 conditions (conversion between 40 and 50%) in which toluene dispropor- tionation is carried out. The introduction of sulphur and lead poisons metallic nickel, inhibiting these reactions (Figs. 3 and 4) and reducing the loss in aromatics, with a concomitant strong decrease in formation of the lightest compounds (Ci + Cz). From the point of view of selectivity, it was noticed that after ageing Ni HM became less selective in aromatics; this did not happen to the cata- lysts of sulphurized Ni and Pb/Ni HM, which maintained approximately the same selectivity. The behaviour of Ni HM, i.e. a decrease of selectivity on ageing, can be explained by the activation of some of the nickel which was not pre- viously reduced, and had remained in the form of Ni2\"1\" or Ni\"1\" [7, 11, 12]. Once exposed to high temperature, these forms would be reduced during the ageing test, increasing the active metallic surface area and therefore the production of non-aromatic compounds. In contrast, the metallic phase Pb/Ni and also sulphurized nickel withstood the high temperature of ageing, demonstrating the stability and ureversibility of the bonds of lead and sulphur to the nickel. The difference in the behaviour of the metallic func- tion of the poisoned nickel catalysts can be evaluated by comparing both the hydrogenating and hydrogenolysis activities of these catalysts with those of Ni HM. In fact, the formation of ETB from xylenes only takes place in the presence of an active metal, since it is a reaction with a bi- functional metal-acid mechanism [13,14]. Based on the values of selectivity in ethylbenzene (% ETB in Cg aromatics) which remain constant, we can conclude that the hydrogenating activity of the metallic function of Pb/ Ni HM, Ni-HM-S(l) and Ni HM-S(2) was not reduced relative to that of Ni-HM. Regarding hydrogenolysis activity. Fig. 4 shows the hydrogenolysis mactivation of the catalyst by lead and sulphur, whose presence greatly decreases Ci and C; formation resulting from the cleavage of alkyi aromatics and paraffin molecules. We can conclude that neither sulphur nor lead seems to modify the hydrogenating activity of the nickel, however they are extremely toxic to the hydrogenolysis activity. In the case of sulphur poisoning, the dif- ference in toxicity for these two types of reactions is already known [15, 16]. The fact that the hydrogenating function maintains its activity after poisoning may indicate the existence of different sites on nickel, specific for each of the reactions, with different poisoning resistances [17]. The high heterogeneity of nickel particles sizes may also have contributed to the non-uniformity of poisoning, since smaller metallic particles have a much better resistance to poisoning by sulphur [18], and may have been respon- sible for the hydrogenating activity. This resistance of the hydrogenating function to poisoning by sulphur may be related to the nature of the support [1]; since it is a dealuminated mordenite, it presents a greater concentration of strong acid sites than the 235 most common zeolites. Landau et al. [19] noticed that the sulphur resis- tance of a catalyst based on a metal dealuminated zeolite Y is connected with an interaction between the metal and the strongly acidic hydroxyl groups on the zeolite surface. It is interesting that lead presents selective effects identical to those of sulphur, which may mean that these elements have comparable electronic effects [16]. With respect to the stability of the different catalysts, Ni HM suffered the greatest deactivation, its acid sites being strongly affected. The coke content obtained for Ni HM was also the highest, which can be attributed to the fact that this catalyst showed a higher hydrogenolysis activity than the others (Fig. 4), and, according to Barbier etal. [20], coke formation occurs preferentially on the hydrogenolysis sites. Additionally, it must be taken into account that Ni HM operated under temperatures slightly higher than the other catalysts. Finally, it is important to note that sulphur clearly interacts with the support causing an increase of catalytic activity (Fig. 2), in comparison with the Ni HM catalyst alone. The increase m the disproportionation activity can be attributed to an increase of acidity promoted by the adsorption of sulphur over the support, converting the Lewis acid sites into Bronsted acid sites which are much more active for the disproportionation, since sulphur in the H2S form behaves similarly to water. The decrease in disproportiona- tion activity in the presence of lead cannot be explained by a poisoning of the metallic function, since the toluene disproportionation is a monofunc- tional acid reaction. The hypothesis of interaction with the acid sites cannot be excluded, but possibly the decrease m the disproportionation activity is caused by a greater difficulty in access of the toluene to the acid sites, as the metallic Pb/Ni particles have an average size greater than the N1 particles in Ni-HM.

        "dc:description": "The disproportionation of toluene was carried out on a dealuminated Ni-H mordenite and the influence of nickel poisoning with sulphur or lead was studied. Ni-H mordenite exhibits medium or rather low selectivity in aromatics and fairly good stability. The poisoning of Ni-H mordenite with sulphur or lead induces a similar increase of both the selectivity in aromatics and the stability of the catalyst. Neither sulphur nor lead modifies hydrogenating activity, although they show a high toxicity to hydrogenolysis activity. Sulphur increases the disproportionation activity of Ni-H mordenite; this can be attributed to an interaction of sulphur with the acid support, converting Lewis acid sites into Brönsted acid sites. Lead has an opposite effect, which can be explained by an increase in the size of the metallic Pb/Ni particles which probably thus restricts access of toluene to the acid sites.",
