Graphical abstract The effect of catalyst preparation method and metal precursors on the catalyst basicity were studied in Pd catalysts supported on magnetic SBA-15 for benzyl alcohol oxidation (BzOH) to benzaldehyde (BzH). The reaction was carried out in an environmentally friendly condition, i.e, in the absence of additive and solvent, at low temperature (95 °C) in the presence of oxygen. Various techniques such as ball milling and impregnation as well as different precursors such as nitrate and chloride of palladium were applied for catalyst preparation. Among them, MPM-2 catalyst which was prepared by nitrate precursor and physical hand mixing, exhibited the most optimized basicity. The intensity of 2.9 × 10−10 of total basicity was measured by CO2-TPD experiment. The catalysts showed 50 % of BzOH conversion and 95 % of selectivity towards BzH after 3.5 h. The activation energy of the reaction was significantly decreased and reached 17.6 kJ.mol-1. Keywords Benzyl alcohol Benzaldehyde Alcohol oxidation Basic catalyst 1 Introduction Benzaldehyde is a simplest aromatic aldehyde that exists in nature. It is widely used in the aroma chemicals, pharmaceutical, dyestuff, and agrochemical industries [1,2]. Industrially, BzH is produced mainly through hydrolysis of benzyl chloride in an alkaline environment or oxidation of toluene[3]. In the hydrolysis process, the product, BzH, is contaminated by traces of chlorine, and in the oxidation process, the selectivity towards BzH is very low. The vapor phase oxidation of BzOH has been extensively studied in the past to meet practical requirements of chlorine-free BzH. However, the process has limitation including carbon losing due to total oxidation of a part of BzOH into carbon dioxide at high temperature [4,5]. Hence, the liquid phase oxidation of BzOH into BzH at lower reaction temperature is of interest due to both economic and environmental reasons. Traditionally, expensive and toxic materials such as manganese and chromium salts have been applied as stoichiometric oxidants in this process [6,7] which make the process as a not-green chemical reaction. So far, several homogenous Pd [8,9], Au [10,11], Cu [12] or Ru [13,14] materials have been used as the catalysts for the selective oxidation of alcohols. However, use of complex ligands or expensive metal or high-pressure oxygen is required [7]. The present stringent ecological standards have forced investigators to develop the new efficient and ecologically benign methods. Therefore, a solvent-free process has been taken into account which could be carried out in the presence of a basic material such as NaOH and Na2CO3 [15–17] and over semiconductors materials [18]. It has been demonstrated that the presence of a basic component facilitates OH bond cleavage. A basic material such as NaOH supplies O H - to the active sites, i.e. Au, in order to form surface active sites O H a d - species where H—abstraction from alcohol takes place [19]. Zhu et al. [20] demonstrated that the activity of the carbon supported gold catalyst for selective oxidation of alcohol has been improved significantly in the presence of NaOH. Moreover, it has been reported that the suppression of the byproducts formation and the catalyst lifetime has been improved in the presence of NaOH significantly [15]. However, using an alkaline environment for alcohol oxidation also brings on drawbacks, such as catalyst dissolution, metal leaching, side reactions rate enhancement including keto-enol equilibration, Cannizzaro reaction, and oxidative decarbonylation [21], and difficulty in product purification [19]. Researchers have developed an alternative method by grafting basic sites on the surfaces of the supports to overcome the disadvantages of using a strong basic material such NaOH. The grafting basicity on the surface of the catalyst supports can enhance alcohol dehydrogenation, suppress by-products formation and accelerate the desorption of products while maintaining the pH of the solution without any significant changes [22]. For instance, a 100 % conversion in the benzyl alcohol oxidation has been reported by Hu et al.[23] using a highly dispersed Au nanoparticles on the surface of functionalized silica materials. Chen et al. [24] synthesized Pd catalysts supported on TUD-1 mesoporous silica functionalized by amino group. The Pd catalysts were highly effective for the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the absence of any inorganic base showing a turnover frequency TOF of 18,751 h−1 for Pd supported on TUD-1 [24]. Sujandi et al. [25] applied the short-channeled amino-functionalized-SBA-15 catalyst for Knoevenagel condensation of carbonyl compounds with ethyl cyanoacetate. The results showed that the reaction can proceed to olefin products and no intermediate alcohols or other side products were detected [25]. Despite the effectiveness of the functionalized supported catalysts, these basic functional groups cannot attach to the substrate firmly and may leach out under severe reaction conditions [26]. Therefore, the researchers have tried to work on an authentic basic mesoporous material which could be used as the catalyst support directly [26]. Accordingly, Meenakshisundaram et al. [27] have used the Au–Pd bimetallic catalyst supported on basic supports, such as ZnO and MgO, for benzyl alcohol oxidation at low temperature of 80 ℃ . The reaction selectivity to benzaldehyde has been enhanced significantly compared to non-basic support, e.i, TiO2 [27]. Moreover, Wang et al. [26] applied monometallic Pd and Rh catalysts supported on nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon (NMC), mesoporous carbon (MC) and acid-activated carbon (AC). Both Pd and Rh catalysts on basic NMC exhibited higher activity and selectivity toward benzaldehyde than those on other carbon supports including neutral MC and acidic AC [26]. So far, the effectiveness of Pd catalysts has been thoroughly demonstrated for benzyl alcohol oxidation [24,28–30]. In addition, cobalt oxide has been widely used for various catalytic reaction such as dehydrogenation, CO oxidation and oxidation of alkyl aromatics in the liquid phase as well as oxidation of benzyl alcohol [31–33]. In recent years, magnetically separable nanocatalysts have become attractive because they can be separated from the reaction mixture with an external magnet and without using conventional separation techniques such as filtration or centrifugation [34–36]. Moreover, it has been reported that the catalysts preparation method and even the metal precursors affect the catalysts properties such basicity and acidity which in turn bring about the remarkable effects on the catalysts performance [37–39]. These studies have inspired us to develop Pd supported on a magnetic SBA-15 catalysts and investigate how different methods such as conventional impregnation (IM), ball milling (BM), chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and physical hand mixing (MPM) as well as various precursors such as palladium chloride and nitrate can impact the catalyst performances for BzOH oxidation in a solvent-free mixture. The performances of Pd supported on magnetic SBA-15 catalysts prepared by physical hand mixing (MPM-2) was demonstrated by the effective catalytic oxidation of BzOH to BzH in the presence of oxygen at 95 °C. MPM-2 exhibited 50 % conversion of BzOH and 95 % of selectivity towards BzH. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalysts preparation 2.1.1 Magnetic SBA-15 preparation The method reported by Ojeda et al.[40] have been used for magnetic SBA-15 preparation. 0.5 g of SBA-15 which was prepared in our group [41], was grounded with 0.5 g of Co (NO3)2.6H2O in a 125 mL milling jar containing 25 stainless steel balls with the size of 10 mm. The mixture was ball milled in Retsch PM-100 planetary ball milling machine for 30 min at 350 rpm. The as-synthesized ball-milled nanocomposite was collected from the machine and was slowly heated up to 300 °C under air (1 °C.min −1) and kept at 300 °C for 6 h. The support was denoted as MagSBA-15 containing 17 wt% of Co. 2.1.2 Impregnation An adequate amount of Pd (NO3)2 solution was added dropwise into the dry powder of MagSBA-15 support and stirred for few hours. Then, the mixture was dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 12 h prior to calcination at 300 ℃ for 3 h in the hydrogen atmosphere. The catalyst was named as IM-1 containing 4 wt% of Pd 2.1.3 Ball milling A desired amount of Pd (NO3)2 and support (MagSBA-15) were ball milled for 10 min at 150 rpm using 10 stainless steel balls with the size of 10 mm. The mixture was heated at 300 ℃ under H2/N2 (50:50, v/v) for 3 h. The catalyst containing 4 wt% of Pd was denoted as BM-1. 2.1.4 Manual physical mixing The calculated Pd precursor either Pd (NH3)4Cl2 or Pd (NO3)2), and MagSBA-15 support were put in the agate mortar and grounded manually for 10 min. Then, the mixture was put in the ultrasound for 1 h and dried overnight prior to reduction in H2 /N2 (50:50, v/v) at 300 ℃ for 3 h. The catalyst synthesized from Pd (NH3)4Cl2 precursor was named as MPM-1 containing 4 wt% of Pd and the one synthesized using Pd (NO3)2 was denoted as MPM-2 with the same content of Pd. 2.1.5 Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) A total of 0.06 g Pd(acac)2 and 0.5 g as-synthesized MagSBA-15 were mixed and put in the boat and evacuated in vacuum. The furnace was then heated to 300 °C (at 10 °C. min −1) and kept at 300 °C for 2 h. The solid was finally reduced in H2:N2 = 1:1 atmosphere at 300 °C for 30 min. The catalyst is denoted as CVD-1-300. For comparison, another sample was reduced at 350 °C for 1 h, which is named as CVD-1-350. The NH3-treated catalyst, CVD-1-350-NH3, was developed as well. The procedure is explained in the following section. 2.1.6 Ammonia treated catalysts CVD-1-350 were treated with N2 under vacuum for 30 min to remove the impurities first at 300 °C (at °C.10 min−1) and kept at the temperature for 3 h (60 cm3. min−1). Then the furnace was heated to 500 °C in nitrogen atmosphere and the gas was switched to anhydrous ammonia. The sample was held under ammonia flowing at 60 cm3. min−1 for 20 min at 500 °C and then purged with nitrogen at the operating temperature for 15 min to remove unreacted ammonia gas. The as-synthesized catalysts were named as CVD-1-350-NH3. 2.2 Characterization Crystal structures of materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired on a Philips PW1830 powder X-ray diffractometer using the Cu Kα radiation whose wavelength was 1.540562 Å. The presence of different organic groups was confirmed by FTIR (Perkin-Elmer GX 2000). Samples were grinded into powder, diluted with potassium bromide (KBr, Sigma Aldrich, 99 %) at a proper ratio and compressed into a tablet with a pressure of 30 MPa for 10 s. Adsorption spectrum from 400 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1 was recorded with scan times of 16. JEOL JSX-3201Z X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) was used to determine the relative contents of sulfur and metals in the whole sample. Physical Electronics PHI 5600 XPS spectrophotometer with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source was used to investigate the elemental composition and chemical state of elements near the surface of a material. Specific surface area and pore volume of catalysts were measured using adsorption isotherm of nitrogen at 77 K by a surface analyzer (Beckman Coulter SA3100). Approximately 0.05 g of one sample was put into a sample tube and outgassed under vacuum at the proper temperature for at least 3 h. Adsorption isotherm was recorded in the relative pressure (p/p0) range from 0 to 0.99. The specific surface area was calculated in p/p0 range from 0.05 to 0.2 using BET (Brunaue-Emmett-Teller) equation. The total pore volume was calculated at p/p0 = 0.9814 using adsorption capacity and sample weight. The surface morphologies of samples were characterized by a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-6700 F). Thermal stabilities were studied on a thermogravimetric analyzer (PerkinElmer TGA 7) under a nitrogen flow of 60 mL.min-1 at a heating rate of 1 °C/min from room temperature to 900 °C. The sample weight was recorded and plotted against temperature. The samples basicity was evaluated by ammonia treatment. The prepared catalyst was treated with N2 with the flow of 60 cm3.min −1 under vacuum at 300 ℃ with heating rate of 10 °C. min −1 for 3 h. Then the furnace was heated to 500 ℃ in the N2 atmosphere and the gas was switched to anhydrous ammonia with the flow of 60 cm3.min −1 for 45 min. Then sample was purged with N2 for 15 min to remove unreacted ammonia while the temperature maintained at 500 ℃ . CO2-TPD-MS equipment was used for basicity measurement in this study. The solid was weighted and put into the quartz tube which was placed into the temperature-programmed furnace. The sample was purged by He with the flowrate of 30 ml. min −1, and pressure between 0.1-0.2 MPa, at 200 °C for 2 h. Then, the sample was exposed to CO2 with pressure and flow rate of 0.1-0.2 MPa and 60 ml. min −1, respectively, for 1 h. The residue of physically adsorbed CO2 was removed by He with pressure and flow rate of 0.2-0.3 MPa and 30 ml. min −1, respectively, for 0.5 h. The chemically adsorbed CO2 was heated to 850 °C with the heating rate of 10 °C. min −1 to let the MS measure the amount of the desorbed CO2. The basic sites were categorized as weak, medium and strong when CO2 desorbed at temperatures lower than 200 ℃, between 200 and 500 ℃ and higher than 500 ℃, respectively. 2.3 BzOH oxidation Liquid phase oxidation of BzOH utilizing molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant was conducted in a magnetically stirred three-neck flask (10 mL), which was equipped with a tubular reflux condenser. The flask was heated to a target temperature by a temperature-controlled oil bath. A 0.05 g of a catalyst was stirred with 10 mL BzOH with continuous oxygen purging by a glass rotameter at atmospheric pressure. Samples containing reaction products, as well as intermediates, were taken intermittently and solid catalysts were separated from the mixture by centrifugation. The liquid products were analyzed by gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector using Altech Aquawax capillary column. External calibration method was used for quantitative analysis. The BzH selectivity was defined as the amount of BzH produced divided by the amount of the converted BzOH. 3 Results and discussion XRD spectra of the prepared samples is shown in Fig. 1 . MagSBA-15, MPM-1 and MPM-2 exhibited a plateau-patterned signal in the range of 22–25° which was attributed to the amorphous silica phase from the SBA-15. In addition, MagSBA-15 support exhibited two peaks at 36.7° and 65.1° corresponding to the (311) and (440) cubic spinel structure of Fd3m space group confirming the formation of phase pure Co3O4 which is consistent with the standard JCPDS No: 76-1802 [42]. However, no diffraction peak was observed in the case of Pd-loaded catalysts because the as-prepared catalysts were treated in H2 for 3 h which may cause partially reduction of Co3O4 to CoO or Co species. Moreover, no diffraction peak corresponding to CoO was detected as well. This might be due to the amorphous structure of Co3O4/CoO or the small crystalline nanoparticles with the size smaller than x-ray coherence length which result in featureless XRD pattern. In addition, no diffraction peak corresponding to Pd was distinguished (Fig. 1). This phenomenon might be a consequence of the low loading of Pd (4 wt%) and uniform dispersion on the support [43]. The presence of cobalt oxide species in the structure of MPM-2 and MPM-1 was further confirmed by XPS analysis (Fig. 2 a-b). XPS spectra of Co2p showed two distinct peaks at BE of at 781 and 797 eV corresponding to Co3+ and Co2+ species, respectively. Moreover, two satellite peaks were emerged at ∼787 and ∼804 eV corresponding to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively. These satellites peaks were used as a fingerprint for the recognition of high-spin Co+2 species in CoO. Hence, XPS results confirmed the existence of CoO species in the structure of the developed catalysts [44–46]. Moreover, the catalysts exhibited a typical doublet of 3d core level bands centered at ∼340 and ∼335 eV corresponding to Pd° 3d3/2 and Pd° 3d5/2, respectively (Fig. 2c-d) [34]. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms, shown in Fig. S1a-b, indicate that all the evaluated samples (MagSBA-15 and MPM-2) exhibited the typical type IV isotherm with H1-type hysteresis loop characteristic of the mesoporous material with a highly uniform size distribution according to the IUPAC classification [47]. Pore size distribution calculated by the BJH method showed that the pore sizes were in the range of 6−8 nm. The morphology of the developed materials was characterized by TEM-EDX (Fig. 3 a-d). Fig. 3a shows that the nano-sized cobalt wires were found in the mesopores of SBA-15. They were geometrically well aligned along the pore channels. Fig. 2b is the clear cross-sectioned image of the cobalt functionalized SBA-15. The presence of black dots demonstrates that the cobalt has been functionalized into the channels and filled up the pores’ mouth regions. With the palladium deposition on the MagSBA-15 catalysts, in Fig. 2c, the palladium nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of support. Generally, they were located outside the SBA-15 crystals and acted as active sites, as illustrated in Fig. 2c. Moreover, Fig. 3a-d indicate that the morphology of SBA-15 remained intact after Co functionalization using ball-milling, Pd loading by impregnation and subsequent reduction in H2 for 3 h. The 3D morphology of MPM-2 catalyst was further studied using High Angle Annular Dark Field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) (Fig. 4 ). The SBA-15 matrix, Co parallel nanowires (bright elongated structures followed the channels direction), Co and Pd NPs of the catalyst could be seen clearly. The elemental mapping of the red area was investigated by STEM-EDS (Fig. S2a-b). Maps of Co-K and Co-L in Fig. S2a-b indicating that both particulate and linear structure of Co nanoparticles (17 wt.%) are present in the structure. The results imply that Co precursor (Co (NO3)2·6H2O) could be introduced into the channels of SBA-15 by using simple ball-milling method. The nanowires morphology was formed after calcination while some Co nanoparticles would aggregate outside the pores and form larger nanoparticles. The Pd-K and Pd-L maps in Fig. S2c-d exhibit a uniform dispersion of Pd nanoparticles in the catalyst as well. Notably, it is well-documented that the basicity is essential for an alcohol oxidation to an aldehyde [15–17]. Therefore, the basicity of the prepared catalysts using various methods were investigated by CO2-TPD-MS. Three developed catalysts including MPM-2, BM-1 and IM-1 were tested accordingly. Fig. 5 and Table 1 show the CO2 desorption profiles and the strength of the basicity, respectively. The results showed that the developed catalysts exhibited basicity even though the amount and the strength of the basic sites were different. The number of strong basic sites were in order of IM-1 > BM-1 > MPM-2. However, the number of weak basic sites were in order of MPM-2 > BM-1 > IM-1. These results confirm that preparation methods would have a significant influence on the basicity of the catalysts which is in good agreement with the literature. It has been investigated that the catalyst preparation method will affect the particle size and distribution of the active components into the support [38,39]. Use of impregnation method results in the bigger size of the active components with the low homogenous dispersion into the support [48] which was confirmed by TEM images of IM-1 catalyst (Fig. 3c and Fig. 4). The Pd particles deposited on the surface of the support could cause nonhomogeneous dispersion of Pd in the aggregated form which produced a total basicity of 1.6×10−10. Moreover, using the ball milling method can result in the smaller particles and more homogenous dispersion than impregnation method. It can be seen from Table 1 that the catalyst BM-1 possessed a uniform distribution of the basic sites with a total of 1.81 × 10−10. However, using ball milling might transfer some active components deep in the pores which might not be available during CO2 adsorption /desorption test resulting lower amount of total basic site compared to MPM-2 with the total basic sites of 2.9 × 10−10. The dispersion of Pd particles in MPM-2 might not be homogenous as BM-1 while better than that of in IM-1. This can provide more Pd particles available for basicity measurement which therefore, more basic sites in total (2.9 × 10−10) (Table 1). The catalytic performance of the prepared catalysts including MPM-2, BM-1 and IM-1 were studied in the BzOH oxidation to BzH at 95 °C. The performance is shown in Fig. 6 . BM-1 and MPM-2 exhibited higher conversion of BzOH than IM-1 at 95 °C. A 45 % and 42 % of BzOH conversion were achieved in the presence of MPM-2 and BM-1, respectively, after 3.5 h. However, the selectivity toward BzH was in the order of BM-1 > MPM-2 which is in good agreement with the literature. It has been reported that the aerobic oxidation of BzOH is highly dependent on the catalyst basicity [49]. In addition, BzOH conversion can be higher in the presence of a catalyst possessing weaker basic sites than a catalyst with strong basic sites. However, the selectivity depends on the strong basic sites significantly [17,30,50,51]. Thus, it can be concluded that the basicity of the catalyst should be optimized for a satisfactory conversion and selectivity which is in good agreement with the literature in which the pH for oxidation of BzOH to BzH has been optimized at 9.2. A further oxidation of BzH to benzoic acid as by-product occurs at pH 9.5 [52]. The control experiments using MagSBA-15, SBA-15 and Pd/SBA-15 is tabulated in Table S1. It can be inferred that SBA-15 and MagSBA-15 could not catalyze the reaction. However, Pd/SBA-15 exhibited 30 % and 80 % of conversion and selectivity, respectively, which was lower than those in the presence of MPM-2. It has been reported that benzyl alcohol could dissociate homolytically on noble metal surfaces, i.e. Pd, to produce an alkoxy intermediate (Pd−CH2-O*). In addition, the cleavage of OH bond on the noble metals is a surface-oxygen assisted reaction in which H can be abstracted from Pd−CH2-O* by empty Pd sites to form the surface benzaldehyde (Pd−CHO) species. The presence of Pd and CoO prepare an acid/base bi-functional catalyst in which Pd nanoparticles and the O2− of CoO, and Co2+ act as the Lewis base and acid sites, respectively [53–55]. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that MPM-2 has higher catalytic activity compared to that of Pd/SBA-15 which indicates that the presence of CoO can boost the conversion. Moreover, higher performance of MPM-2 compared to BM-1 was in agreement with results in the literature for BzOH oxidation [56]. Kondrat et al. prepared Au, Pd, Au-Pd supported on TiO2 catalysts using a simple and scalable manual physical mixing method. The catalysts showed better catalytic activities than those prepared through the conventional impregnation and deposition precipitation [56]. Lin et al. stated that an improved distribution of Pd particles can be achieved by the physically grinding which leads to significant improvement in the catalyst activity [57]. In addition, according to the report, it can be expected that using different metal precursors, result in a significant change in the catalyst properties [37]. In this respect, the effect of metal precursor was investigated. A different Pd precursor, Pd (NH3)4Cl2• H2O, was used for catalyst preparation, i.e. MPM-1, (Section 2.1.4). The basicity of MPM-1 was evaluated and tabulated in Table 1 and Fig. S3. The results showed that the substitution of Pd (NO3)2• H2O with Pd (NH3)4Cl2• H2O slightly decreased the weak basic sites and significantly increased the strong basic sites of the catalyst (MPM-1) which was confirmed by the catalysts activity (Fig. S4). MPM-1 showed lower conversion compared to MPM-2 even though it exhibited better selectivity. This phenomenon could be as the result of the chloride-based precursor. The presence of the chloride might reduce the dispersion of nanoparticles (NPs) on the support resulting in the bigger Pd particles than that of when the nitrate based precursor was used which in turn brings about a significant increase in the strong basic sites [58]. The aggregation of the Pd particles was confirmed by HAADF-STEM of MPM-1 (Fig. S5) and HAADF-STEM of MPM-2 (Fig. 4). In addition, it is known that the presence of chloride in a catalyst can cause particle agglomeration and some active sites blocking. These effects can lead to loss of catalyst activity, which is well documented for CO oxidation with gold monometallic catalyst [56]. In addition, the presence of Cl− in the catalyst structure might result in the formation of weak Brönsted acid sites which has been reported by Finocchio et al. [59]. Moreover, the existence of the cobalt oxide species in Co loaded SBA-15 (MagSBA-15) bring about Lewis acidity [45,59]. Lewis and Brönsted acid sites as well as weakly acidic silanol groups from SBA-15 might affect the catalysts performance in BzOH oxidation [60–62]. Therefore, the influence of acidity on the catalytic performance was investigated as well. Subsequently, a series of catalysts that could form the acidity gradient were synthesized using CVD method (Section 2.1.5.). It was assumed that acetylacetonate ligand of the Pd(acac)2 precursor, can be deposited on the catalysts during CVD and produce acidity for the CVD developed catalyst (CVD-1-300, CVD-1-350 and CVD-1-350-NH3). This hypothesis was confirmed by XPS analysis of C1 s of CVD-1-300 (Fig. S6). The C 1s spectrum in Fig. S6 reveals three different species, located at 284.9, 287, and 289.4 eV corresponding to CC sp2, CO bonds and OCO bonds, respectively [63,64]. Moreover, the catalysts acidity was further modified using higher temperature decomposition to reduce the amount of deposited ligand (CVD-1-350). The CVD-developed catalysts were used for BzOH oxidation. The results are shown in Fig. 7 . Fig. 7 revealed that BzOH conversion was in order of CVD-1-300> CVD-1-350 > CVD-1-350-NH3 which was in line with the acidity of the catalysts in the order of CVD-1-300> CVD-1-350 > CVD-1-350-NH3. It was assumed that CVD-1-300 catalyst which was synthesized by decomposition of the precursor at low temperature left behind more acetylacetonate ligands on the catalyst which in turn increased the acidity more than that of CVD-1-350 which was heated at 350 °C. In addition, attempt was done to suppress the acidity as well as to provide basic sites through the catalyst treatment using NH3. A fraction of NH3 might react with the carbon matrix or surface groups during ammonia treatment which results in the formation of the surface basic N containing groups [65]. Fig. 7 showed that the catalysts selectivity was indirectly proportional to the acidity. The results were consistent with the literature in which the influence of the catalyst acidity has been studied [60–62]. It has been reported that the catalyst acidity results in the formation of the by-products such as benzyl benzoate and dibenzyl ether which result in a significant decrease in selectivity which was observed in this study (Fig. 7). It can be seen from Fig. 7 that the catalyst with higher acidity (CVD-1-30) exhibited higher conversion (80 %) although it had lower selectivity (78 %) compared to CVD-1-350 and CVD-1-350-NH3 with the selectivity of 90 % and 95 %, respectively. Hence, it can be inferred that acidity can boost the rate of BzOH conversion even though it can decrease the selectivity and lead to more by-products formation. It can be concluded that the acidic properties of the catalysts are not favorable due to the by-product formation while the basic properties of the catalysts should be considered in catalyst development applicable in BzOH oxidation. The effect of basicity on the catalyst performance was further investigated by applying different amount of catalyst, from 0.025 g to 0.075 g, into the reaction containing 10 ml of BzOH. The result is depicted in Fig. 8 . It is clearly seen in Fig. 8 that a 50 % of conversion and 95 % of selectivity were achieved in the presence of 0.05 g of the catalyst after 3.5 h while applying 0.025 g of MPM-2 resulted in a significant decrease in BzOH oxidation. Moreover, applying 0.075 g of the catalyst decreased the conversion up to 30 % after 3.5 h while the selectivity remained 98 %. This might be caused by the amount of the basicity in the reaction system which has been confirmed in this study (Fig. 6) and elsewhere [17,30,50,51]. The system with 0.075 g of MPM-2 had higher basicity than that of 0.05 g which resulted in lower conversion and higher selectivity. The effectiveness of the catalyst in BzOH oxidation was further confirmed by activation energy calculation. Hence, the activation energy (Ea) of the BzOH oxidation reaction was calculated in presence of MPM-2 at various temperatures. The result has been illustrated in Fig. 9 a-b. Fig. 9a shows a linear fitting of the conversion versus time, indicating that the reactions were pseudo zero order at 80−100 °C. Therefore, Arrhenius equation (Eq. 1) was considered for Ea calculation. The relationship between lnk and 1/T has been illustrated in Fig. 9b. (1) K = B e - E a R . T ⇒ ln k = - E a R 1 T + B (Ea) was calculated from the slope of Arrhenius plot (Fig. 9b) as 16.7 kJ/mol. Ea of this study was better than that of reported in solvent-free and solvent-rich reactions, respectively, (Table 2 ). For instance, Ea of 43.7∼54.1 and 45.8 kJ.mol−1 have been reported by Chen et al. [24] and Enache et al. [66] in the presence of TUD-1 supported palladium and TiO2-supported noble metal catalysts, respectively. 4 Conclusion Various methods such as IM, BM, CVD and MPM, and different precursors including nitrate and chloride salts of palladium were studied for catalyst preparation applicable to aerobic oxidation of BzOH to BzH in solvent-free environment at low temperature (95 °C). Amongst, MPM-2 catalyst which was developed by physical hand mixing of the MagSBA-15 and palladium nitrate salt exhibited an optimized basicity and acidity. The developed catalyst exhibited a satisfactory conversion (50 %) of BzOH and a significant selectivity (95 %) toward BzH after 3.5 h. Ea of the reaction was calculated as 16.7 kJ.mol−1 indicating that BzOH oxidation was catalyzed significantly by MPM-2 catalyst.

        "dc:description": "The effect of catalyst preparation method and metal precursors on the catalyst basicity were studied in Pd catalysts supported on magnetic SBA-15 for benzyl alcohol oxidation (BzOH) to benzaldehyde (BzH). The reaction was carried out in an environmentally friendly condition, i.e, in the absence of additive and solvent, at low temperature (95 °C) in the presence of oxygen. Various techniques such as ball milling and impregnation as well as different precursors such as nitrate and chloride of palladium were applied for catalyst preparation. Among them, MPM-2 catalyst which was prepared by nitrate precursor and physical hand mixing, exhibited the most optimized basicity. The intensity of 2.9 × 10−10 of total basicity was measured by CO2-TPD experiment. The catalysts showed 50 % of BzOH conversion and 95 % of selectivity towards BzH after 3.5 h. The activation energy of the reaction was significantly decreased and reached 17.6 kJ.mol-1.",
