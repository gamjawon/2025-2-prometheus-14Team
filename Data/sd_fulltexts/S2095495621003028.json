College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Taiyuan University of Technology Taiyuan 030024 Shanxi China Graphical abstract A bifunctional electrocatalyst of VN/nitrogen-doped graphene can simultaneously catalyze the deposition and dissolution of insoluble Li2S for lithium-sulfur batteries, thus suppressing the shuttle effect of polysulfides. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are regarded as one of the promising candidates for the next-generation energy storage system owing to their high capacity and energy density. However, the durable operation for the batteries is blocked by the shuttle behavior of soluble lithium polysulfides and the sluggish kinetics in the redox process. Here, VN nanoparticles on nitrogen-doped graphene (VN/NG) composite is synthesized by simple calcining method to modify the separators, which can not only chemically trap polysulfides, but also catalyze the conversion reaction between the polysulfides and the insoluble Li2S during the charge/discharge process. The catalytic effects of VN/NG are verified by the calculated activation energy (E a), which is smaller than the counterpart with NG toward both directions of redox. Because of the synergistic adsorption-catalysis of VN/NG, the cells with VN/NG-modified separators deliver a superior rate performance (791 mAh g−1 at 5C) and cycling stability (863 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles with a low decaying rate of 0.068% per loop at 1C). This work provides a simple preparation strategy and fundamental understanding of the bifunctional catalyst for high-performance Li-S batteries. Keywords Li-S battery Lithium polysulfide Vanadium nitride Electrocatalyst Activation energy 1 Introduction With the development of portable electronics and electric vehicles, the demand for a reliable electricity storage system is becoming urgent [1,2]. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery, regarded as one of the most promising next-generation energy storage techniques, has drawn significant attention in recent years owing to the conspicuous advantages of high theoretical specific capacity and low-cost [3]. Based on the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) involved multiple redox reactions, the Li-S battery could deliver a theoretical gravimetric energy density as high as 2600 Wh kg−1, which is quintuple that of the conventional lithium-ion battery [4]. However, the commercial application of Li-S battery has encountered several key challenges, including poor utilization of sulfur and rapid capacity degradation, which originate from the shuttle behavior of soluble LiPSs [5]. To mitigate the shuttling of soluble LiPSs, extensive efforts have been made. One of the most effective strategies is to confine the sulfur species into myriad porous conductive scaffolds, involving sorts of carbonic materials, such as porous carbon [6,7], carbon nanotubes [8,9], graphene [10–12], and conductive polymers [13]. Meanwhile, the physical confinement and chemical barriers by transition metal compounds for the intermediate species are also explored to solve the above problem [14]. Although great progress has been achieved, the negative effect of the LiPSs shuttling cannot be entirely suppressed due to the kinetically sluggish reduction of LiPSs into the insoluble final product of Li2S, and vice versa. Besides, the sluggish redox kinetics of LiPSs will beget the accumulation of various sulfur species in the electrolyte, leading to deteriorated electrochemical performance. Therefore, the improvement of the redox kinetics of LiPSs conversion is one of the top priorities to realize high-performance Li-S battery. Recent researches have been devoted to accelerating the conversion kinetics between LiPSs and Li2S by introducing polar materials as catalyst materials, which is considered to be an effective strategy to alleviate the shuttle effect [15,16]. Many works are reported to explore the emerging candidates, such as transition metal oxides [17], sulfides/selenides [18,19], phosphides [20], carbides [21], and nitrides [22], to catalyze the redox process, and the Li-S batteries demonstrates remarkably enhanced electrochemical performance. Nonetheless, most of the previous studies mainly focused on the reduction of LiPSs during the discharge process. However, the further development of Li-S batteries is also handicapped by the sluggish activation kinetics of insoluble and insulated Li2S in the oxidation process, which would lead to impeded electron transfer and lowered the Columbic efficiency [23]. Hence, designing a catalyst for dual redox reaction in Li-S batteries is absolutely required [24–27]. Besides, the underlying basis for the dual redox catalysis needs to be addressed, and attention should also be paid to predigesting the preparation process. Herein, we present a facile strategy for fabricating the nitrogen-doped graphene decorated with vanadium nitride nanoparticles (VN/NG) via a direct calcining method as a novel dual redox catalyst for Li-S batteries. The electrochemical results demonstrated that the VN/NG could trap the LiPSs and guide the rapid deposition of insoluble Li2S in the discharge process, as well as improve the oxidation kinetics of Li2S during the charge process. The catalytic effects of VN/NG toward both directions of redox are verified by the calculated activation energy (E a), which is smaller than the counterpart with separators modified by nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) substrate. Consequently, with the convenient-prepared VN/NG as the bifunctional catalyst, the cells deliver a superior rate performance of 791 mAh g−1 at 5C and a reversible capacity of 863 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles with a low decaying rate of 0.068% per loop at 1C. More importantly, the cell with a sulfur loading of 3.2 mg cm−2 also exhibits a stable cycling life up to 200 cycles. 2 Results and discussion The VN/NG composite was obtained by a two-stage heating method, and the crystalline structure of the composite was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 1 (a), the diffraction peaks at 37.6°, 43.7°, and 63.6° are related to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of cubic VN structure (JCPDS No. 35-0768), respectively. The broad peaks indicate the minor feature of VN particle size, which was calculated to be 9 nm along the (200) direction via the Scherrer equation. The additional signal around 25° is ascribed to the (002) plane of graphite, evidencing the partially graphitic nature of the support. This is further confirmed by the XRD pattern (Fig. S1) of NG, which was prepared through the same method of VN/NG but without adding NH4VO3. The content of VN in the composite is approximately 33% according to the thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S2 and Note S1). The surface species of VN/NG were further investigated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. S3, the survey spectrum shows the coexistence of V, N, C, and O elements. The high-resolution V 2p spectrum presented in Fig. 1(b) could be well fitted into three doublets of V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 from V3+ to V5+. The peaks located at 513.8 eV and 521.3 eV are assigned to trivalent vanadium ions, corresponding to the VN [28]. The existence of tetravalent and pentavalent vanadium ions indicate that a thin oxide layer is formed on the surface of VN/NG [29,30]. This result is also verified by the high-resolution O 1 s spectra. As shown in Fig. S4(a), the peaks located at 531.5 eV for O−C and 532.8 eV for O−H are observed in both samples. However, an extra signal at 530.4 eV originated from O–V is detected in VN/NG [28], demonstrating the presence of vanadium oxide on the surface. Both NG and VN/NG present almost the same peaks of C 1s spectra (Fig. S4b). The peak at 284.8 eV belongs to graphitic C=C–C, and the peaks at 285.8, 287.6, and 290.8 eV are assigned to C–N, C=O, and O–C=O bonds [24], respectively, indicating the presence of N and O-containing groups, which can highly improve the absorbability of materials for LiPSs through their polar-polar interaction. As presented in Fig. 1(c), the high-resolution spectrum of N 1s region shows five characteristic peaks: N–V bond (397.2 eV), pyridinic N (398.6 eV), pyrrole nitrogen (399.6 eV), graphitic N (401.2 eV), and oxidized N (403.2 eV) [31–33], implying the successful doping of the N element into the graphitic carbon. All the results demonstrate that the obtained composite comprises VN nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped graphite-like carbon. The morphologies of VN/NG and NG were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SEM images (Fig. 1d and Fig. S5a) reveal that both samples displayed an ultrathin flexible sheet-like structure. But the surface of VN/NG is rough, and the surface of NG is relatively smooth. The two-dimensional structure of both samples can be confirmed through TEM observations. The close-up check on the graphene sheets brings up the difference between the samples. As can be seen in Fig. 1(e) and Fig. S5 (b), the ultrafine VN nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the graphene sheets but absent on that of NG. As estimated from the HRTEM images in Fig. 1(f), the diameter of the VN is approximately 10 nm, which coincides with the XRD results. Such a small size allows VN nanoparticles to expose more active sites, benefitting the strong interactions between VN and soluble LiPSs. The HRTEM image (Fig. 1g) exhibits clear lattice fringe for VN nanocrystals. The fringe displays a d-spacing of about 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (200) plane of cubic VN. High-angel annular dark-field scanning TEM (HADDF-STEM) images (Fig. 1h) and element mapping were employed to figure out the element distribution of the VN/NG. As illustrated, the patterns of C, V, N, and O are well overlapped, confirming the homogeneously distributing of the VN throughout the whole composite. All the results demonstrate that the ultrafine VN nanoparticles are well attached to NG, which would favor the charge transfer between NG and VN, thereby accelerating the LiPSs conversion kinetics. Furthermore, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of VN/NG measured by N2 sorption isotherm is 385.7 m2 g−1 (Fig. S6a). The large surface area and a highly porous structure with an average pore diameter of 1.2 nm (Fig. S6b) can supply more reaction active sites for LiPSs species. As the first step of an electrocatalytic reaction, the adsorption of reaction substrate on the catalyst is the premise of the subsequent conversion reactions [15,34]. To assess the LiPSs-confining capability of VN/NG and bare NG samples, a LiPSs visualized adsorption test was conducted by the addition of VN/NG and NG with the same weight into Li2S6 solution. As shown in Fig. S7(a), the solution with VN/NG turned nearly colorless after 4 hours of static adsorption, while the solution with NG was lightly decolored compared with the controlled Li2S6 solution. Accordingly, UV–vis absorption spectra show similar variation trends in absorption signals, confirming the stronger interactions between Li2S6 and VN/NG. Since the high-order Li2S8 is prone to decompose to soluble S6 2−, the stronger absorptivity of VN/NG towards Li2S6 could deplete the S6 2−, therefore accelerating the consumption of the high-order sulfur species and promoting the next-step conversion process. XPS (Fig. S7b) was conducted to further investigate the chemical interactions between Li2S6 and VN/NG. After contact with Li2S6 solution, the intensity of the V3+ component in the V 2p spectrum increases significantly, while that of the higher valent vanadium ions component decreases concomitantly. This phenomenon indicates the vanadium species on the surface are partially reduced by Li2S6, suggesting the adsorption between VN/NG and Li2S6 is the existence of chemical adsorption [35]. Several methods were devoted to revealing the LiPSs-involving redox behavior on the surface of NG and VN/NG. First, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was carried out to record the symmetric cell tests with two identical electrodes as both the working and counter electrodes. As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a), the voltammogram of VN/NG shows highly symmetrical profiles with three pairs of redox peaks in the presence of Li2S6 at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1, while the current could be negligible in the absence of Li2S6. The redox peaks at −0.06/0.06 V, −0.38/0.38 V, and −0.08/0.08 V should be attributed to the reversible stepwise electrochemical reactions of Li2S6 ↔ Li2S4, Li2S4 ↔ Li2S2/Li2S, and S8 ↔ Li2S6, respectively. In contrast, the current on the NG electrode is far lower than that on the VN/NG electrode, and the staged peaks cannot be observed, pointing to a better electrocatalysis effect on LiPSs-involving redox reactions at the surface of VN/NG. Besides, the CV curves of the symmetric cell with VN/NG electrode (Fig. S8) at higher scan rates were obtained to prove its excellent catalytic capability. The staged redox peaks remain distinguishable as the increasing of scan rate, indicating that the VN/NG can still fasten the kinetics of LiPSs-involving redox reactions even at rapid scan rates. Chronoamperometry technology was applied to validate the catalytic properties of NG and VN/NG on the Li2S precipitation and dissolution process [24,36]. Fig. 2(b) shows the potentiostatic current profiles of Li2S precipitation on the surface of obtained samples. Before the nucleation process, the long-chain LiPSs are reduced by discharging to 2.06 V in advance. Then a small overpotential of 10 mV is applied to drive the nucleation and growth process. As shown in SEM images in Fig. S9, there is a contiguous and thick deposition layer of Li2S solid on the surface of VN/NG electrode after Li2S precipitation, while only thin Li2S films can be observed on NG. According to Faraday’s law, the Li2S precipitation capacities are calculated based on the weight of sulfur species in the catholyte. The cell with VN/NG electrode delivers a higher capacity (129.1 mAh g−1) than that of NG (101.5 mAh g−1), demonstrating that the VN/NG can significantly promote the Li2S nucleation and growth process compared with the NG substrate. To further study the superiority of VN/NG in the Li2S dissolution stage, a similar cell configuration is used. To ensure the sufficient transformation of soluble sulfur species to Li2S, two-step galvanostatic discharge processes are conducted, followed by a potentiostatic charge process at 2.40 V. As exhibited in Fig. 2(c), VN/NG electrode results in a relatively higher current response compared to NG electrode, indicating that the VN/NG could reduce the overpotential of the oxidation of Li2S, and thus promote the conversion process of Li2S [25]. Furthermore, compared with that of NG (143.5 mAh g−1), a higher dissolution capacity is detected on the electrode with VN/NG (168.2 mAh g−1). The morphologies of different electrodes after Li2S dissolution are also presented. As illustrated in Fig. S10, the Li2S films still exist on NG surface, but for VN/NG electrode, the Li2S deposits have no obvious aggregation. This result indicates that the VN/NG can favor the Li2S dissolution process on the surface of VN/NG. The electrocatalytic effect of the obtained samples is further evaluated by assembling coin cells with metallic lithium foil as the anode, acetylene black/sulfur composite (AB/S) as the cathode, and the synthesized samples (VN/NG and NG) are employed as functional membrane loaded on Celgard 2400 membrane (PP). To assess the detailed electrochemical behavior, the CV curves of the cells with NG/PP and VN/NG/PP separators are depicted in Fig. 2(d). Both the CV curves show two distinct pairs of cathodic peaks and anodic peaks. The cathodic peak at high potential is ascribed to the reduction from sulfur to soluble long-chain LiPSs, while another cathodic peak at lower potential corresponds to the further reduction of long-chain LiPSs to insoluble Li2S/Li2S2. The anodic peaks during the backwards scanning can be ascribed to the reversible oxidation of Li2S2/Li2S to LiPSs and further to sulfur. The voltage gap between the redox peaks for the cell with NG/PP separator (0.30 V) is much larger than that with VN/NG/PP separator (0.25 V), indicating the smaller electrochemical polarization with the assistance of VN/NG. The decrease in polarization would improve round-trip efficiency. Moreover, Tafel plots of cells with different separators for the cathodic and anodic reactions are compared in Fig. 2(e, f). Clearly, VN/NG presents lower Tafel slopes than NG for both the lithiation and delithiation processes, indicating the accelerated polysulfide conversion kinetic rates and alleviative Li2S oxidation process [37]. To fundamentally reveal the catalysis of VN/NG in the reduction and oxidation process, the E a at selected voltage is explored by measuring the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) at different temperatures. It is generally considered that the conversion from soluble LiPSs to insoluble Li2S2/Li2S is the rate-determining step in the reduction process [32]. Therefore, the voltages at 2.1 and 1.8 V were selected as the study points (Fig. 3 c), which represent the conversion of soluble LiPSs to Li2S2/Li2S and the further reduction to the final product of Li2S, respectively. As for the oxidation reaction, the voltage at 2.3 V was chosen to represent the oxidation process of Li2S. The temperature-dependent EIS spectra of cells at the selected voltages with VN/NG/PP and NG/PP separators are presented in Fig. S11. By fitting the temperature-dependent R ct into the Arrhenius equation, E a at each voltage could be obtained (Fig. S12 and Note S2, S3). Compared to the cells with NG-modified separators, the temperature dependence on ln(R −1) of the cells with VN/NG-modifieds separator is much weaker at every voltage (Fig. 3a, b). Specifically, the calculated E a for the cells with VN/NG-modified separators at 2.1 and 1.8 V during the discharge process are 0.47 and 0.57 eV (Fig. 3c), which are smaller than that with NG-modified separators (0.60 and 0.72 eV). This result further demonstrates that the VN/NG can significantly lower the energy barriers and accelerate the conversion of soluble LiPSs to insoluble Li2S2/Li2S. Such a phenomenon also occurred in the charge process. The cell with VN/NG-modified separators delivers an E a of 0.54 eV, smaller than the counterpart with NG-modified separators (0.66 eV). The smaller E a for the oxidation of Li2S plays a crucial role in realizing high capacity and Columbic efficiency [23]. In summary, the small E a in both the discharge and charge process demonstrates the origin of the accelerated kinetics, and further confirms the dual redox catalysis of VN/NG for the conversion between LiPSs and Li2S2/Li2S. The dual-redox catalysis of VN/NG was further investigated via density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Since the bidirectional catalysis is mainly related to the conversion between Li2S4 and Li2S, the optimized adsorption configurations with corresponding energetic information of Li2S4 and Li2S on different catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 (a). The binding energy (E b) of Li2S4 (1.429 eV) and Li2S (2.344 eV) molecules on the VN (200) surface are considerably higher than those on NG (001) substrate (0.132 eV and 0.319 eV), which indicates the stronger adsorption ability of VN for Li2S4/Li2S. We can simultaneously obtain the bond length from the molecular models of sulfur species (Li2S4 or Li2S) on the selected surface of VN and NG. It is clearly observed that the S–S bonds of Li2S4 on VN are longer compared with those on NG, reflecting the weaker bonding strength in Li2S4 molecules on VN, demonstrating the facilitated conversion from Li2S4 to Li2S on the VN substrate [25]. The longer Li–S bond length of Li2S on VN (2.253 Å) demonstrates the easier decomposition of Li2S in the charge process. Accordingly, the energy barrier of the Li2S decomposition process was calculated to further confirm it. Based on previous reports, the decomposition process is described as the breaking of Li2S into LiS cluster and Li+ with the subsequent diffusion process of Li+ as shown inset of Fig. 4(b) [38]. The energy barrier profiles of Li2S decomposition on the surface of catalysts (Fig. 4b) show that VN possesses lower decomposition energy barrier (0.85 eV) than NG (1.14 eV), benefiting to enhance Li2S oxidation kinetics during charging. To further understand the dual-redox catalysis of VN theoretically, the reversible reaction profiles from Li2S4 to Li2S on both substrates and the corresponding Gibbs free energies are shown in Fig. 4(c). It can be seen that the reaction Gibbs free energies from Li2S4 to Li2S2 (0.693 eV) and further to Li2S (0.629 eV) on VN is smaller compared with NG (1.027 and 1.023 eV). This result indicates that the VN can catalyze the evolution between Li2S4 and Li2S and thus improve the reaction kinetics, which is consistent well with the experiment results mentioned above. The electrochemical performance of coin-type cells with NG and VN/NG modified PP separators are evaluated via the galvanostatic charge–discharge process. For comparison, coin cells with bare PP are also assembled. Fig. S13 shows the discharge/charge voltage curves of cells with various separators in the voltage range between 1.7 and 2.8 V at a current rate of 0.5C (1.0C = 1675 mA g−1) during the first cycle. Each profile exhibits a similar discharge/charge profile which consists of the cathodic/anodic peaks in the CV curve. But the potential polarization of cells with VN/NG separators (183 mV) is the smallest among the three types of separators, revealing the fast conversion kinetics for LiPSs facilitated with the assistance of VN/NG as discussed above [33]. The decrease in potential polarization would also improve the cycling performance. As displayed in Fig. 5 (a), the cell with bare PP separator exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 802 mAh g−1. Owing to the serious LiPSs shuttle effect, the capacity drops to 600 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles [39]. After adding NG or VN/NG layers, there are significant enhancements in terms of reversible capacities. Specifically, the cell with VN/NG separator delivers a high capacity of 1261 mAh g−1 and maintains 977 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles. It is worth to note that the contribution of the VN/NG-modified separators on the capacity could be negligible (Fig. S14). These data are much higher than those with NG/PP separators (1091/852 mAh g−1). The improvement on cycling performance at a low current rate indicates the higher sulfur utilization and effective alleviation of shuttle effect, pointing to the kinetic advantage of VN/NG-modified Li-S batteries. The upgrade of electrochemical properties is also reflected in rate performances. As described in Fig. 5(b), the cell with NG separator delivers capacities of 1358, 1072, 784, 689, 661, and 627 mAh g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5C, respectively. While the capacities of cells with VN/NG separators are as high as 1557 mAh g−1 at the rate of 0.2C, exhibiting the high utilization of the sulfur. Besides, with the increase of the current rate, the difference between the two separators gets more noticeable. The cell with VN/NG separator delivers capacities of 1208, 1099, 962, 861, and 791 mAh g−1 at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5C, respectively, all of which are much higher than their counterparts with NG separators. Moreover, the higher and more stable discharge capacity with VN/NG separators can be preserved when going back to 0.5C, indicating excellent electrochemical reversibility. The superior capability of VN/NG at a high current rate agrees well with the better absorptivity and catalysis of VN/NG (to NG) toward the LiPSs-involving redox reactions as discussed above. The galvanostatic discharge/charge profiles (Fig. S15) with modified separators at various current rates are presented. The profile at 0.2C displays two discharge plateaus at around 2.35 and 2.10 V and one long charge plateau between 2.2 and 2.4 V, which corresponds to the CV curves. The splitting-step-plateau feature of the electrochemical behaviour can be well retained even at a high current rate of 5C. Furthermore, the potential polarization of cell with VN/NG separators at each current rate is smaller than the counterpart with NG separators (Fig. 5c), confirming the faster conversion kinetics for the redox reaction even at high current rate. Also, the rate property of VN/NG separators is not only better than that of NG separators, but also better than those in previous reports (Fig. 5d) [35,40–45]. As mentioned above, the VN/NG can not only trigger the formation of solid Li2S during the discharge process, but also accelerate its conversion to higher-fraction LiPSs during recharging. Therefore, the Li2S grains would not seriously accumulate on the surface of the electrode and the whole electrochemical conversion process could proceed smoothly [46]. Meanwhile, the enhanced kinetics of LiPSs conversion also leads to mitigating self-discharging capacity loss (Note S4). As shown in Fig. S16, the capacity loss (1.41%) observed in cells with VN/NG separators is much lower than that with NG (3.10%), illustrating the inconspicuous polysulfide shuttling. The cell with VN/NG separator also presents an excellent long-term cycling stability at 1C. As exhibited in Fig. 5(e), it delivers a superior initial discharge capacity of 1082 mAh g−1, and still holds a reversible capacity of 862 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles with a decaying rate of 0.068% per loop. This result is much better than the performance of the cell with NG (680 mAh g−1, 0.1%). In addition, the Coulombic efficiency of the cell with VN/NG separator maintains at 99.9% after 300 cycles, while that of cell with NG significantly declines after 200 cycles, which is the critical evidence that the VN/NG can effectively alleviate the shuttle effect and enhance sulfur utilization. To further demonstrate the superiority of the cell with VN/NG separator, a long-term cycle test is carried out at a high rate of 2C. As shown in Fig. 5(f), the battery maintains a capacity of 838 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles with an average decay rate of 0.062% per cycle. Then, the capacity maintains 545 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles. Compared with previous works with modified layers, the cycling performance of the cell with VN/NG is comparable (Table S1). To be in line with the practical, the cell with high areal sulfur loading of 3.2 mg cm−1 and low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 10 μL mg−1 is performed at 0.2C after the activation at 0.1C for the first five cycles (Fig. S17) [47,48]. It presents a high initial capacity of 3.86 mAh cm−2 and a reversible capacity of 2.56 mAh cm−2 after 200 cycles, correspondingly a specific capacity of 807 mAh g−1. Even though the E/S ratio decreases to 5 μL mg−1, the cell with VN/NG modified separator can still deliver a high capacity of 1307.7 mAh g−1 at 0.05C for the initial cycle and remains 851.8 mAh g−1 at 0.2C after 50 cycles (Fig. S18). The excellent cyclic stability of the cells even at a high current rate and sulfur loading should be ascribed to the superior polysulfides affinity, and especially the dual redox catalysis effect of the VN/NG nanocomposites. To gain further insights into the diffusion process of lithium ions, cyclic voltammetry is devoted to investigating the kinetics in the Li-S battery system. CV curves of cells with VN/NG and NG separators at different sweep rates (v) are displayed in Fig. 6 (a, b). As the sweep rate increases, the cathodic peaks shift to the negative voltage and the anodic peaks move to the positive, resulting from the polarization related to ion transfer. The linear plots of I p as the function of v 0.5 are displayed in Fig. 6(c–e) for different redox peaks, and the corresponding lithium-ion diffusion coefficient ( D L i + ) for the step-wised peaks could be obtained based on the Randles-Sevcik equation (Note S5). As can be concluded from Fig. 5(f) and Table S2, the VN/NG-modified separators showed the larger D L i + at each redox peak compared with the NG-modified separators, suggesting the better redox reaction kinetics stemming from the catalysis of VN/NG. 3 Conclusions In summary, the composite with the uniform distribution of VN nanoparticles on nitrogen-doped graphene substrate was obtained via a facile calcining method. The nanosized VN particles can supply a large number of active sites for capturing LiPSs and catalyzing the conversion reaction between the absorbed LiPSs and the insoluble Li2S during the redox process. EIS spectra at different temperatures were measured to determine the E a for the LiPSs involved multiple redox reactions. The results reveal that the cell with VN/NG-modified separator shows smaller E a compared with NG. Therefore, the conversion kinetics of adsorbed LiPSs to Li2S and conversely oxidation to sulfur is enhanced. With these merits of VN/NG, the cell exhibits improved sulfur utilization, superior rate performance and cycling stability. This work provides a fundamental understanding of the bifunctional catalyst, which would provide a new vision towards realizing high-performance Li-S batteries.

        "dc:description": "Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are regarded as one of the promising candidates for the next-generation energy storage system owing to their high capacity and energy density. However, the durable operation for the batteries is blocked by the shuttle behavior of soluble lithium polysulfides and the sluggish kinetics in the redox process. Here, VN nanoparticles on nitrogen-doped graphene (VN/NG) composite is synthesized by simple calcining method to modify the separators, which can not only chemically trap polysulfides, but also catalyze the conversion reaction between the polysulfides and the insoluble Li2S during the charge/discharge process. The catalytic effects of VN/NG are verified by the calculated activation energy (E a), which is smaller than the counterpart with NG toward both directions of redox. Because of the synergistic adsorption-catalysis of VN/NG, the cells with VN/NG-modified separators deliver a superior rate performance (791 mAh g−1 at 5C) and cycling stability (863 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles with a low decaying rate of 0.068% per loop at 1C). This work provides a simple preparation strategy and fundamental understanding of the bifunctional catalyst for high-performance Li-S batteries.",
