(+81-886)557025 (Received November 3, 1992; accepted January 22, 1993 ) Abstract Oxidation of ethyl lactate to pyruvate was carried out in the liquid-phase at 130 C in the presence of the oxides of various group IV to VI elements as candidate catalysts. Optimized reaction conditions with Ti02 as a probe catalyst followed by comparative reaction studies for catalyst screening showed Ti02, Zr02, and Sn02 ( + Sn0) to be highly selective catalysts for giving pyruvate. Effects of temperature, oxygen pressure, solvents, and catalyst requirements are described. XPS and XRD patterns are given for a binary oxide, Sn02_M0O31 which showed excellent activity in favor of pyruvate. Key words: ethyl lactate; ethyl pyruvate; liquid-phase oxidation; oxide catalyst Introduction Pyruvic acid has received increasing attention in recent years as a potential precursor for the synthesis of I,-amino acids [ 1,2 ] and cyanoacrylate adhesive, and as a solvent for photoresist [3 ] in electronic processing. An established laboratory procedure [ 4 ] for pyruvic acid synthesis, first described by Erlenmeyer [5] as early as 1881, is the dehydrative decarboxylation of tartaric acid in the presence of an excess of powdered potassium hydrogen sulfate (KHS04), a unique dehydrating agent to afford pyruvic acid [4], and common dehydration catalysts such as t7-alumina resulted in the further decomposition of the product pyruvic acid [ 6 ] . Although the hydrogen sulfate melts at a low temperature of 197 C [ 7 ] , it was successfully adapted for vapor-phase flow operations as a silica-supported pyrosulfate catalyst (KZS207/SiO2) to obtain ethyl pyruvate continuously from the tartrate in a good yield of 60% at 300 C [8]. An alternative approach to pyruvic acid, bypassing the expensive tartrate, has been made by the catalytic oxidation of lactic acid in aqueous phase [9] (Scheme 1, R= Na). No absorption of oxygen was observed in the attempted *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved. 208 H. Hayashi et al./J Mot.

The advantage of running the reaction in a liquid phase over the gas-phase fixed-bed operation for the production of fine chemicals is generally accepted in terms of inexpensive plant investment, stability and flexibility for operating conditions, and greater ease for renewal and/or making-up of catalyst. However, in the case of noble metal catalysts such as platinum and palladium, even slight degeneration badly affects the production cost. Thus attempts were made in the present work to obtain ethyl pyruvate by liquid-phase oxidation of the lactate over suspended oxides of group IV to VI elements as candidate catalysts (Scheme 1, R=CZHS). Optimizing reaction conditions employing Ti02 as a probe catalyst followed by comparative reaction studies for catalyst screening revealed Ti02, Zr02, Sn02, and Sn02-Mo03 to be highly selective catalysts to afford pyruvate. Experimental Apparatus and procedure To a three-neck flat-bottom -flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a gasinlet, and a liquid-sampling port, was added 50 cm' of a solution of ethyl lactate, and the vessel was adjusted to the desired temperature. A given amount of catalyst powder was added, and then oxygen or a mixture with nitrogen was bubbled through the reaction liquor at a flow rate of 6 dm3/h under stirring (600-1000 rpm, magnetic stirrer). Aliquots of the reaction liquor were taken at intervals and analyzed for lactate and pyruvate by gas chromatography using a Hitachi 263-FID instrument with a 10% PEG 4000/Flusin T (60-80 mesh, 3 mm O X 1 m) column at 140 C. Reactions under high pressure were carried out in a glass autoclave, Type U-300 (Taiatsu, Tokyo), equipped with a stirrer blade and an oxygen-bubbling port dipped in the reaction liquor, both made of Teflon'. NMR spectra of the reaction solution were measured by a Hitachi 8024 spectrometer. Materials Ethyl lactate and the diluents (diethyl succinate, acetophenone, and dimethyl sulfoxide) were purchased from Wako (Osaka), and used as supplied. The ethyl pyruvate used for the calibration of the GC analysis was obtained from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). H. Hayashi et al./J. Mol. Catal. 83 (1993) 207-217 209 Preparation and characterization of catalysts Ti02 (anatase), Zr02,WO,,, Te02 and V205 were obtained from Wako (Osaka), and Mo03 from Merck, (Darmstadt). Another Ti02of high surface area anatase was prepared [ 10 ] by neutralizing an aqueous solution of TiC14 with urea (molar ratio= 2) . Sn02 was obtained by heating Sn (OH) 2, which was precipitated from an aqueous solution of SnC12 by adding aqueous ammonia [ 11 ] . The stannous hydroxide thus obtained was mixed with a solution of ammonium molybdate to give as atomic ratio of Sn/Mo=9/1. The paste was dried and decomposed at 300 C in air, and then calcined at given temperatures to obtain Sn02-MOO3. An aqueous solution of ammonium molybdate and ferric ammonium oxalate, (NH4) 3Fe (C204) 3 3H20 (Wako), was evaporated to dryness over a steam bath, and the resulting mass was decomposed and calcined at 400 C in air for 5 h to give Fe203-MOO3 (Fe/Mo =1/2) . Te02Mo03 (Te/Mo=1/2) was prepared from the component oxides by kneading with an appropriate amount of water, dried, and calcined at 500 C in air for 5 h. The surface area was determined by nitrogen adsorption (Shibata P-700 volumetric apparatus) at liquid N2 temperature. Acidity was measured by nbutylamine titration [ 12,13 ] in benzene using dimethyl yellow (pKa = 3.3) as an indicator. Powder X-ray diffraction was measured by a MXP system (MAC Science Co., Tokyo). X-Ray photoelectron spectra for Mo 3d5/2 and Sn 3d5,2 core electrons of Sn02-MO03were measured by Perkin Elmer-Phi 5500 (Ulvac-phai, Chigasaki), irradiated with Mg Ka, and the observed binding energies were calibrated with 285.0 eV for C is electron. Results and discussion Optimizing reaction conditions employing anatase Ti02 as a probe catalyst A variety of single oxides showed activity for oxidation of ethyl lactate to pyruvate. Reaction conditions such as temperature, oxygen pressure, solvents, and catalyst requirements have been optimized, tentatively employing anatase Ti02 as a probe catalyst. Illustrative runs and reproducibility Figure 1 illustrates reproducible oxidation behavior of ethyl lacatate to pyruvate over suspended Ti02. The results were compared for reaction up to 5 h (open symbols) and 12 h (closed symbols) under the same conditions with different lots of Ti02taken from the same batch of preparation. Lactate conversions for the two runs are superposed on a single line, showing an excellent fit with first-order kinetics. Pyruvate was obtained selectively, in good agreement with lactate conversion at the earlier stages of the reaction. 210 80i \\ 60 a v c 40 o .N i o 20 O~ 'L _L _L A 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time / h (a) O, H.

Effect of temperature and oxygen pressure Figure 2 shows the effect of temperature on the oxidation of ethyl lactate, the conversion of which at 5 h (open circles) increased with temperature to a maximum at 130 C followed by a decrease at higher temperatures. The reaction was carried out under atmospheric pressure by bubbling oxygen through the reaction liquor under vigorous stirring. Both ethyl lactate and ethyl pyruvate boil at the same temperature (155 C ), and the actual oxygen pressure decreases at higher temperatures due to an increase in vapor pressure of the liquid component (unbroken line). The oxygen pressure at 130 C and 150 C would be 0.48 and 0.08 atm, respectively. To avoid such variation of oxygen pressure with temperature, another set of runs has been done at a constant oxygen pressure of 2 atm but varying total H. Hayashi et al./J Mol. Catal. 83 (1993) 207-217 211 pressure accounted for the liquid component at the reaction temperature (dashed line). Thus a higher conversion (47.5 %) was obtained at 150 C with n=2.9 atm as compared with that of 30.8% at 130 C with n=2.5 atm (closed circles). It is noteworthy that the present reaction was inhibited when carried out in a stainless-steel vessel. A glass autoclave equipped with a stirrer blade and an oxygen-bubbling port (both made of Teflon) was used for the reaction under pressure. Effect of solvent and initial concentration of lactate Oxidation of ethyl lactate to ethyl pyruvate could be carried out without solvent, but a double dilution with high-boiling esters such as dimethyl succinate gave better yields of pyruvate (Fig. 3). An initial concentration of ethyl lactate of less than 2 mmol/dm' appears to be unfavorable both for rate and selectivity. No improvement was observed when the diluent was acetophenone, and dimethyl sulfoxide inhibited the reaction. Solubilities of oxygen in organic media (14,15) such as acetone, methyl acetate, ethanol, 2-propanol, benzene, and o-xylene at temperatures of 0-100 C are in the same order of magnitude (0.2-0.3 cO3 OZ/cm3 liquid). It is difficult to account for the solvent effect given in Fig. 3 on the basis of the differences in oxygen solubilities. Catalyst requirement Figure 4 shows the effect of catalyst concentration over a wide range of 0.01-4 g Ti02/50 cm3-liquor on the lactate conversion and pyruvate selectivity at 5 h of reaction.

A large excess of catalyst (1-4 g) resulted in a slight decrease in rate with an improved selectivity to pyruvate. Activity of various catalysts Catalyst screening Comparative reaction studies have been carried out for the oxidation of ethyl lactate over various oxide catalysts under the same conditions tentatively optimized with Ti02 as follows: temperature, 130 C; catalyst, 0.1 g; initial concentration, 234 mmol ethyl lactate/50 cm3 (51.5 wt.%); diluent, dimethyl succinate; oxygen, 6 dm'/h; stirring rate, 700-1000 rpm. The results are summarized in Table 1 together with the properties of the oxide catalysts. It is of interest that single oxides less common as oxidation catalysts, such as Ti02. Zr02, and Sn02 ( + Sn0), were more highly selective for pyruvate than Mo03, Te02, and V205, and activities were similar together. A high surface area Ti02 prepared by neutralizing TiC14 with urea [ 10 ] was inactive but the activity appeared when washed with dilute nitric acid. The liberated acidic sites may trap the alcoholic substrate on the surface, but are less selective for pyruvate as compared with commercially available anatase-type Ti02. A binary oxide often shows properties of surface area, acidity, and redox behavior quite different from its component single oxides, providing wide possibilities for catalyst preparation [ 16 ] . Activation of lattice oxygen may be observed at high temperatures and multi-component oxide catalysts have been 'The authors have not yet fully interpreted the effect of catalyst concentration. A referee suggests an interesting portrayal that a very low saturation concentration exists of dissolved catalyst which takes care of the oxidation. The inhibiting effect of traces of metal wall (autoclave) components might be in line with this. However, the Langmuir adsorption of molecular oxygen verified in Fig. 8 appears to be a strong evidence for heterogeneous catalysis. H. Hayashi et al./J. Mol.

However, a literature survey suggested a unique binary oxide, Sn02-MOO3, as a candidate catalyst for liquidphase oxidation of ethyl lactate. The catalyst was effective for hydrative oxidation of propylene to acetone [ 11,12 ] in a gas-phase flow system at temperatures as low as 130 C. Increased acidity with higher surface area for Sn02-MOO3 compared to its component oxides, Sn02 and Mo03, were measured as given in Table 1. ThusSn02-MOO3calcined at 300 C in air shows excellent activity for selective liquid-phase oxidation of ethyl lactate to pyruvate. NMR analysis of the reaction solution after 5 h over Sn02_MoO3revealed the presence of the free acids of lactate and pyruvate together with the ethers. The free acids suffer from unfavorable reactions such as decarboxylation and aldol condensation [8], and selectivity on each catalyst may range from middle to high depending on the nature of the catalyst. Other catalysts such as Te02_M0O3and Fe203_ M003were unfavorable for the liquid-phase, but showed high activity in the vapor-phase oxidation of ethyl lactate to pyruvate and the gas-phase results will be published elsewhere [ 17 ] . 214 H.

Stannous hydroxide, which was prepared by neutralizing SnCl2 with aqueous ammonia [ 11 j , gave broad peaks for a component of Sn0 ( ), orthorhombic (O ), and tetragonal ( ) Sn02 when calcined at 200 C in air (a), and the SnO disappeared at 500 C (b). Every peak detected for Sn02_MOO3 calcined at 300 C was assigned to tetragonal Sn02. A trace of orthorhombic Sn02 appeared at 500 C (d), but most was still tetragonal, similar to that observed at 300 C. Nothing was indicated for the other component, Mo03, in XRD, but Xray photoelectron spectra (XPS) for Sn02_MOO3gave Mo 3d5/2 binding energy at 232.9 eV, characteristic of Mo(VI), without any appreciable chemical shifts from the component Mo03 observed at 233.2 eV as shown in Fig. 6 in good agreement with the literature [ 18,19 ] .

Thus the rate is expressed as -rA=kOA (1) where k represents the apparent rate constant including oxygen coverage 002, and BA the lactate coverage.

Molecular oxygen adsorption. The first-order rate constant (kob$) was affected by the oxygen pressure (pot) as shown in Fig. 8 (a) for Ti02 (open circles) and Sn02-Mo03* (closed circles).

Conclusion Ethyl lactate was converted to pyruvate in the liquid-phase on various oxide catalysts at 130 C. Single oxides less common as oxidation catalyst, such as Ti02, Zr02, and Sn02 ( + Sn0 ), and a binary oxide Sn02-M003 were highly selective for pyruvate. A trace amount of the oxide catalyst, as little as 0.02 wt.%, was enough to afford pyruvate, but no reaction was observed without catalyst. Apparent first-order kinetics for lactate conversion was verified and the effect of oxygen pressure on the rate constant provided evidence for adsorption of molecular oxygen on the surface.

Oxidation of ethyl lactate to pyruvate was carried out in the liquid-phase at 130°C in the presence of the oxides of various group IV to VI elements as candidate catalysts. Optimized reaction conditions with TiO2 as a probe catalyst followed by comparative reaction studies for catalyst screening showed TiO2, ZrO2, and SnO2 (+SnO) to be highly selective catalysts for giving pyruvate. Effects of temperature, oxygen pressure, solvents, and catalyst requirements are described. XPS and XRD patterns are given for a binary oxide, SnO2-MoO3, which showed excellent activity in favor of pyruvate.
