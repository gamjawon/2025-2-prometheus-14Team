Box 158, H8201 Veszprem, Hungary Received 1 October 1996; revised 16 December 1996 JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR CATALYSIS A: CHEMICAL Abstract Styrene was hydroformylated in the presence of platinum containing in situ catalysts formed in the reaction of PtClz(diphosphine), tin(II)chloride, and tin(H)triflate (or silver triflate). The reaction resulted in both linear and branched formyl regioisomers, achiral 3-phenyl-propanal and chiral 2-phenyl-propanal, respectively. Using the optically active Pt-bdpp (bp = (2S,4S)-2,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)pentane) systems high ee-s were achieved, which were decreased substantially in the presence of triflate anion. The activity of the catalyst was reduced by the addition of silver triflate and its application in excess resulted in the formation of inactive systems. However, regioselectivity towards chiral branched aldehyde (2-phenylpropanal) was increased both with achiral and chiral bidentate phosphine-containing catalysts upon addition of silver triflate. In the presence of platinum-phosphine-tin(H)chloride in situ systems containing tin(II)triflate consecutive hydrogenation of the aldehyde regioisomers formed in hydroformylation of styrene took also place. Keywords: Platinum; Hydroformylation; 2-Phenyl-propanal; Triflate anion; Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents 1. Introduction Since in most cases only one enantiomer of a racemic mixture shows the desired biological activity, the demand for enantiomerically pure compounds is steadily increasing [1]. Among these derivatives the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAI), especially 2-arylpropionic acids represent a class of pharmaceuticals of high practical importance [2]. In addition to classical organic synthetic methods [3] the synthesis of 2-arylpropionic acids can be carried out by the following homogeneous catalytic procedures: (i) asymmetric hydrovinylation of Corresponding author.

Although there are several limitations concerning chemo- and regioselectivities of the hydroformylation reaction, the moderate to good enantioselectivities and the ease of the synthesis of the substrates are promising for future application. (The probable future commercial synthesis of naproxen (Fig. 1) employs an electrochemical reduction of the 6-methoxy-2-acetylnaphthalene in the presence of carbon dioxide. The resulting a-hydroxypropionic acid is dehydrated to produce the a-naphtylacrylic acid derivative, the appropriate substrate of enantioselective hydrogenation [8].) Early work concentrated on rhodium based catalysts being active even at low temperature, since these might be expected to minimize racemization of the formyl products via ketoenol tautomerism. These catalysts yielded mainly the desired branched aldehyde, but the ee-s were rather low until the use of Takaya's chelating binaphos ligand possessing two phosphorus atoms of different donor strength [9]. In the last two decades platinum-catalyzed reactions have shown the most promise. The platinum-chiral diphosphine-tin(H)chloride in situ systems and PtCl(SnC13)(chiral diphosphine) preformed catalysts are well-known active catalysts in enantioselective olefin hydroformylation and proved to be very efficient for the hydroformylation of both vinyl- [10-15] and vinylidene-type olefins [ 15,16]. They could be considered as efficient catalysts for the synthesis of a-aryl-propionic acids like ibuprofen, naproxen, or suprofen (Fig. 1) [15]. T. Kl, L. Koll/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 122 (1997) 95-101 (2) Furthermore, the presence of tin(II)chloride as trichlorostannato ligand or counterion proved to be crucial for the activity of the platinumcontaining catalytic system [17]. In the presence of basic amines HSnCl3 abstraction from the PtH(SnCl3)PZ intermediate takes place and the platinum complexes obtained did not show any catalytic activity [ 18]. Some platinum-based hydroformylation catalysts containing diphenylphosphinous acid as the ligand, which do not require the presence of SnC12 have been reported in the literature [ 19,20] but do not have been developed. The Pt(0) complexes like Pt(CHZ=CHZ)(PP) (where P-P = diop, (2,3-O-isopropylidene2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane); 1,2-bis(diphenyl-phosphinomethyl)benzene [21], dppb (1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)-butane [22]) show some catalytic activity by the addition of methanesulfonic acid. Although the alkene conversion is quite high (close to the SnC12 added system) the chemoseltivity to the formation of aldehydes is much lower since hydroformylation is always accompanied by the consecutive HOOC CH3 (S)-(+)-ibuprofen H HOOC CHg s (S)-(+)-suprofen HOOC H 00 11 CH3 H3C0 (S)-(+)-naproxen Fig. 1.

The hydrido-complex PtH(0S02CH,XP2) as key-intermediate has been recently postulated [22]. The systematic investigation of these preformed and in situ catalysts lead to our study on the effect of triflate anion of low coordinating ability. In this paper the effect of silver triflate on the tin(II)chloride-containing catalyst, as well as the catalytic features of the hydroformylation of styrene in the presence of tin(II)triflate and tin(II)fluoride cocatalysts will be described. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Chemicals The diphosphine ligands (dppp, bdpp) and tin(II) triflate were purchased from Fluka, Strem and Aldrich, respectively and have been used without further purification. Anhydrous tin(II)chloride was prepared from SnCl2, 2H20 by acetic anhydride and washing with ether. Styrene was distilled under argon before use. Toluene, used as solvent for catalytic experiments, was dried over sodium in the presence of benzophenone and was distilled under argon. PtC12(diphosphine) complexes were prepared according to the literature [ 11 ]. 2.2. Instrumentation ' H and 31 P NMR spectra were recorded in CDC13 on a ,Varian Unity 300 (Palo Alto, CA) spectrometer at 300 and 121.4 MHz, respectively. Chemical shifts are reported in 8 ppm, referred to TMS (tetramethylsilane) as internal standard and to orthophosphoric acid (850, higher fields refer to lower chemical shifts) as external standard. Gas-liquid chromatographic (GLC) analyses were performed on a Hewlett-Packard (Palo Alto, CA) 5830 gas chromatograph using a 97 capillary column (25 m X 0.2 mm) coated with OV-1. Argon was used as carrier gas, with a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min and the injector and detector were set at 250. Oven temperature was held at 50 for 2 min and then ramped to 200 at 10/min. Mass spectra were recorded on a HP-5971A GC-MSD apparatus using a 10 m OV-1 column with the same program. The optical purities were determined by chiral GC (CP-Cyclodextrin-B-2,3,6-M-19 column, 25 m, film thickness 0.25 t,m) on the corresponding 2-phenyl-propionic acid obtained by KMn04 oxidation of the reaction mixture containing 2-phenylpropanal [23]. Argon was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 2 ml/min and the injector and detector were set at 250. Oven temperature was held at 100 for 2 min and then ramped to 200 at 3/min. The retention times of ( S)- and (R)-2-phenylpropionic acid were 32.24 and 32.57 min, respectively. The optical rotations of the products were measured for neat liquids with a Schmidt Haensch LM visual and with a Polamat (Karl Zeiss Jena) automatic polarimeter after fractional vacuum distillation of the product mixture. The optical yields were calculated by use of the reported value, [ a ]D + 238, for neat (S)-2- D [ 10]. The optical yields were checked by NMR in the presence of chiral shift reagent, Eu(dcm) 3. Hydroformylation experiments were carried out in a 100 ml stainless steel autoclave equipped with a magnetic stirrer. 2.3. Hydroformylation experiment In a typical experiment, 0.025 mmol PtClz(diphosphine), 9.5 mg (0.05 mmol) SnC12, 20.8 mg (0.05 mmol) Sn(OTf)Z, 11.5 ml (100 mmol) styrene and 30 ml toluene was placed under argon into a 150 ml stainless steel autoclave. It was pressurized to 80 bar total pressure (CO/H Z = 1 / 1), placed in a thermostated electric oven, and agitated by an arm shaker. The 98 T.

Results Hydroformylation of styrene (1) as model compound in the presence of platinum catalysts has been carried out. The reaction yields both regioisomers, 2-phenyl-propanal (2) and 3phenyl-propanal (3). The reaction is accompanied by the formation of the hydrogenation product of the substrate, ethylbenzene (4) (Eq. (4)). PhCH =CH 2 + CO + H 2 1. PhC * H(CH3)CHO 2 + Ph(CH2)2CH0 + PhC2H5 (4) 3 4 The data of the catalytic experiments allow the following conclusions: (i) The addition of AgOTf to Pt( dppp)C12 + SnC12 catalyst (dppp = 1,3bis(diphenylphosphino)propane) in various molar ratio resulted in lower conversion (Table 1). Using the triflate in excess, the catalyst was desactivated completely (Run 5). However, the use of silver triflate in the same amount as SnC12 (or less) yielded catalytic systems possessing different selectivity features from those without silver triflate additive. (ii) While chemoselectivities decreased slightly upon addition of silver triflate, the regioselectivities towards branched chiral aldehyde of practical importance increased dramatically by the factor of 2.5 (Run 1-4). (iii) The platinum complex of chiral bidentate phosphine bdpp (bdpp = (2 S,4 S)-2,4bis(diphenylphosphino)pentane), which is able to form six-membered chelate ring like dppp, forms active catalyst both at 60 and 100. The regioselectivity towards branched aldehyde has been increased upon addition of AgOTf as has been proved for the dppp-containing systems. A T. Kigl, L.

At low temperature the formation of ( + )-( S)-2, at higher temperature that of (-)( R)-2 is favoured. (iv) The fact that the active catalysts in the presence of additives are different from those without silver triflate can be proved also when SnF2 is used as tin-containing cocatalyst. The PtC12(bdpp) + 2SnF2 catalytic system yields mainly aldehydes in styrene hydroformylation (Run 13). The use of silver fluoride does not cause any significant changes in catalytic properties (Run 14). v) The addition of tin(II)triflate to the tin(II)chloride-containing system resulted mainly in dimerization of the substrate (Eq. (5); Table 2). The hydrogenation of the dimers yielded diphenylbutane isomers up to 12%. 2PhCH=CH 2 PhC*H(CH3)(C(Ph)=CH2) (2-5%) PhC*H(CH3)(CH=CHPh) (90-95%) PhCH2CH2CH=CHPh (3-5%) (5) While using SnC12/Sn(OTf)2 = 2/1 ratio the amount of the aldehyde regioisomers and the corresponding alcohols (chiral 2-phenyl-propanol (2a) and achiral 3-phenyl-propanol (3a)), formed by subsequent hydrogenation, is nearly the same as the amount of dimers, the use of equal amount of SnC12 and Sn(OTf)2 resulted in the formation of dimers almost exclusively, when dppp was used as ditertiary phosphine (Run 1,2). Surprisingly, side-reactions took place in a negligible extent in the presence of bdpp (Run 3,4). 4. Discussion The phenomenon of changing the prevailing enantiomer of 2-phenyl-propanal by the variation of the temperature is known and has been proved in some cases [11,12,24], when bdpp and its analogues have been used as chiral chelating phosphines. The formation of the dominant S enantiomer of 2-phenylpropanal at low temperatures can be due to both steric effects (the presence of major b-skew conformer, which could coordinate the substrate from the si enantioface) and kinetic effects (the increased reactivity of the transition states coordinating the substrate from the si enantioface). The difference in optical yields obtained in the absence and in the presence of silver triflate reflects to the presence of different catalytic intermediates. The strong decrease of ee-s could not be explained only by racemization of the branched aldehyde in elevated reaction time, since it must be rather low at 60. The difference in catalytic systems is also indicated by the slightly increased regioselectivities, which were obtained upon addition of silver triflate. The different selectivities from those without 100 T. Kigl, L. Koll/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 122 (1997) 95-101 triflate can be rationalized by the formation of ionic species in the catalytic cycle (Fig. 2). The cationic species formed by the addition of one equivalent of silver triflate could easily coordinate the olefin and activate hydrogen by the hydrogenolysis of the Pt-Sn bond. (It must be noted, that SnCl3 could also act as counterion [25], and an interplay of [Pt(P2)(L)(SnCl3)]+ and [Pt(P2)(L)(OTf)]+ complex cations may result in the catalytic properties different from the `basic' system.) The activation of carbon monoxide, the CO insertion and the formation of aldehyde regioisomers are favoured by ionic species [26]. Similar ionic species are supposed when tin(II)chloride has been used in excess (SnC12/AgOTf = 2/ 1), but the Pt(P2)X(SnCl3)-covalent species (X = Cl, OTf) are present in higher concentration. By the addition of a further equivalent of silver triflate (SnC12/AgOTf = 1/2) resulted in the formation of [Pt(P2)(OTf)2] covalent complexes, which are unable to activate hydrogen in the absence of trichlorostannato ligand. The Pt(bdpp)(OTf)2 precursor was prepared on the basis of analogous procedure [27] and tested in hydroformylation without showing any catalytic cp/ Pt /CI Sn~i2 P/ \\cl cp/ Pt ,cl P/ \\SnCl3 AgOTf - AgCI PhCH=CHZ HSnC13 p\\ ~ph + Pt OTf HSnCl3 RCHO ~Cp/ \\SnC13 HZ p \\- Ph + P \\\\- Ph + \\Pt/ OTf \\fPt/ [Cl?/ \\C(R, ICp/ \\H PhCH=CHq Pt OTf ~CP/ \\R i Fig. 2.

Reaction of Pt(lI) complexes (on the basis of in situ 31 P studies) activity even in long reaction times. Both the in situ NMR experiments and the synthesis have shown the facile formation of covalent Pt(P2)(OTf)2 complex (when P2 = bdpp, 8 = 10.1 ppm; J(Pt-P) = 3505 Hz) by using two equivalents of silver triflate. However, the addition of tin(II)chloride at the same ratio resulted in nearly quantitative formation of PtCI(SnCl3)(P2) (when P2 = bdpp, 81 = 6.9 ppm; Jl(Pt-P) = 3344 Hz; 82 = 13.1 ppm; J2(Pt-P) = 2730 Hz) (Fig. 3). The catalytic results could be explained by the interplay of Pt(SnCl3)(OTf)(P2) complex formed by SnC12 insertion into the Pt-Cl bond and the above PtCI(SnCl3)(P2) complex. The presence of Pt-SnC13 moiety seems to be indispensable in the `first part' of the catalytic cycle under above conditions, that means the catalytic steps before the formation of platinum-alkyl intermediate are favoured by SnCl2. The addition of tin(II)triflate to the PtCl2(dppp) + SnC12 system leads to the formation of side products of the substrate (mixture of dimers and higher oligomers). In the absence of platinum catalysts similar oligomerization reactions have been observed. The unexpected consecutive hydrogenation of the formyl regioisomers to the corresponding.alcohols indicates the formation of platinum catalysts of novel type, because the PtCI(SnC13)(P2)-type complexes, unlike many cobalt- and rhodium- T. Kl, L. Koll/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 122 (1997) 95-101 containing catalysts, are reluctant towards hy drogenation of the aldehyde. The chlorine-tri flate exchange between Pt-CI and Sn(OTf)2, as well as between SnCl2 and Sn(OTf)2 resulting in SnCl(OTf) and its insertion into the Pt-CI bond, may be responsible for the formation of catalytic species, which are effective hydrogena tion catalysts of the aldehydes. The reaction of Pt(P2)C12 with Sn(OTf)2 yields a 60/40 mixture of Pt(P2)(OTf)2 and PtCI(SnC13)(P2), as well as SnCl2 and unre acted Sn(OTf)2 as was proved by 31P NMR experiments (Fig. 1). The unexpectedly `clean' hydroformylation (without formation of alcohol regioisomers) by [14] using PtC12(bdpp) + SnCl2 + Sn(OTf)2 in situ catalyst can be explained by the fast and domi nant formation of trichlorostannato-platinum species of high carbonylation activity.

Box 158, H8201 Veszprem, Hungary ∗ Corresponding author. Tel.: 36-88-422022; fax: 36-88-426016 Styrene was hydroformylated in the presence of platinum containing in situ catalysts formed in the reaction of PtCl2(diphosphine), tin(II)chloride, and tin(II)triflate (or silver triflate). The reaction resulted in both linear and branched formyl regioisomers, achiral 3-phenyl-propanal and chiral 2-phenyl-propanal, respectively. Using the optically active Pt-bdpp (bdpp = (2S,4S)-2,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)pentane) systems high ee-s were achieved, which were decreased substantially in the presence of triflate anion. The activity of the catalyst was reduced by the addition of silver triflate and its application in excess resulted in the formation of inactive systems. However, regioselectivity towards chiral branched aldehyde (2-phenylpropanal) was increased both with achiral and chiral bidentate phosphine-containing catalysts upon addition of silver triflate. In the presence of platinum-phosphine-tin(II)chloride in situ systems containing tin(II)triflate consecutive hydrogenation of the aldehyde regioisomers formed in hydroformylation of styrene took also place.
