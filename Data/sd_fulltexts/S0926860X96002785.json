The catalysts differed in composition and in conditions of reduction of their precursors. It was found that the hydrogenation could proceed as a consecutive reaction and that this pathway was accompanied by a parallel direct formation of methylcyclohexane from toluene. A positive role of water in a reaction mixture in view of an increased methylcyclohexene yield was also shown. Kevwords: Ruthenium; Sol-gel; Partial hydrogenation, toluene 1. Introduction Ruthenium catalysts prepared by the sol-gel method [1-8] are able to convert aromatic substrates to corresponding derivatives of cyclohexene with high selectivity. It is important that such catalysts effectively work [3,4,9] without the presence of organic [8,10-14] or inorganic modifiers [8,15-25]. Description of the sol-gel preparation procedure [1] and interpretation of the role of the catalysts prepared in this way [1,8,15,25-27] are given elsewhere in detail. In this paper preparation of various ruthenium catalysts by the sol-gel method with different composition and physico-chemical properties is discussed. The catalysts prepared were supported on silica and silica-active charcoal and contained 5 wt.-% of the metal. All catalysts were used in hydrogenation of toluene to methylcyclohexenes and methylcyclohexane. The reactions were * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 Copyright 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Catalysts A list of prepared catalysts is given in Table 1. The sol-gel preparation procedure leading to these catalysts was discussed elsewhere [1,28]. HTR and LTR symbols mean 'high temperature reduction' and 'low temperature reduc- tion' of a polymer precursor of a catalyst, respectively. During the HTR procedure a maximum temperature level of 673 K (for 8 h) was attained. The LTR procedure was preceded by treating of precursors at lowered pressure (2 kPa) at 573 K (for 10 h) and the reduction (LTR) took 8 h at a peak temperature of 523 K. All catalysts but two were supported on silica. The two catalysts (Ru-S-4, Ru-S-8) were supported on silica-active charcoal. Precursors of a silica support -- orthoethylsilicate 99.9% -- were supplied by Aldrich and Dental, precursor of an active component RuC13.nH20 p.a., was from Fluka. Active charcoal support was Supersorbon HB-3 from Degussa. NaOH p.a., used for modification of the catalysts Ru-S-3 and Ru-S-7 was supplied by Lachema.

Analyses of samples of a reaction mixture Samples of a reaction mixture were analyzed on a HP 5890 Series II Plus gas chromatograph (Hewlett and Packard, USA) with FID detector using HP-20M capillary column (50 m/0.32 mm/0.32 /zm), TI-T2 = 333-353 K, P(N2) = 23 kPa, split ratio 1:35 and on a GC-MS analytical system Jeol DX 303 (Jeol, Japan) supplemented with a quartz capillary column SPB 5 (60 m). Position of a double bond in a molecule of methylcyclohexene was also determined with help of NMR spectral analysis on VARIAN-Gemini 300 HC (Varian, USA) at the working frequency 300.075 MHz using standards of the three isomers. 2.4. Analyses of the catalysts XRD analyses of the catalysts prepared were performed on XRD-3000 diffractometer (Richard Seifert and Co., Germany) with Bragg-Brentan's focus- ing geometry, CoK a radiation and graphite monochromator. Measured diffrac- tion lines (Fig. 1) and their intensities were compared with a PDF 2 database [29]. Catalysts Ru-S-5 and Ru-S-8 (LTR) did not show any diffraction peaks and were found to be amorphous regarding both the metal (no lines of Ru, RuO, RuO2) and the support. Diffractograms of the catalysts Ru-S-2 and Ru-S-3 (HTR), Ru-S-6 and Ru-S-7 (LTR) were similar. No lines of a support were observed, however, intensive lines typical for ruthenium were detected (size of elemental crystallites 10-100 nm). In case Ru-S-1 and Ru-S-4 catalysts (HTR) only very diffuse lines of ruthenium were found (size of elemental crystallites 1-10 nm). More accurate values of the metal particle size observed by electron microscopy are given in Table 2. The specific surface area of the catalysts and rough estimations of the pore size distributions of the catalysts were measured by physisorption (adsorption and desorption isotherms) of nitrogen (Table 2) at 78 K (BET) taking the cross-sectional area of a nitrogen molecule 0.162 nm2. The measurements were performed on a Pulse Chemisorb 2700 apparatus (Micrometrics, USA) with a TC detector. Surfaces of ruthenium in the catalysts were measured by a titration method. It was based on oxidation of the chemisorbed surface hydrogen with a suitable 334 P.

Typically 0.1 to 0.3 g of a catalyst was activated in a small furnace at 393 K for 1.5 h, then cooled down, covered with a solvent and transferred to the reactor where it was subjected to the final activation (303 K) in flowing hydrogen (50 ml/min) for 10 min. The reaction was started by injection of a mixture solvent-(water)-substrate to the reactor. The reactions were performed either in methanol or in a mixture of water (33.4 mol-%) and methanol (66.6 mol-%). 3. Results and discussion Hydrogenation of toluene to methylcyclohexene and methylcyclohexane over ruthenium catalysts prepared by the sol-gel method proceeded as a typical consecutive reaction according to the scheme on Fig. 2. Both the steps were of non-zero order to toluene and methylcyclohexene. When using the catalysts supported on silica-active charcoal (Ru-S-4, Ru-S-8) methylcyclohexane was formed directly from toluene (Fig. 3). It was assumed that two kinds of active sites were separately formed during the preparation process -- 'less active sites' and 'more active sites' suitable for consecutive reaction pathway (on silica) and for direct hydrogenation of toluene (on active charcoal), respectively. While the silica support was formed during the sol-gel procedure and the reduction of the polymer precursor [1], active charcoal was added and did not undergo any changes during the preparation. In the silica support ruthenium is most likely incorporated in the support framework resulting into the formation of a stable microporous solid with a very large BET surface area [2]. An other explanation of the diverse behavior of the silica-active charcoal supported catalysts could be based on different intensities of SMSI among ruthenium and both the components of the support [33,34]. It was found that the methylcyclohexene fraction was mainly composed of 1-methylcyclohexene (96 mol-%). The amount of the two other isomers (3-, 4-methylcyclohexenes) did not exceed 4 mol-%. Thermodynamically more stable isomer (1-methylcyclohexene) was, besides its preferential formation, also more easily desorbed because of the substitution on a double bond. High selectivity of the reaction toward formation of 1-methylcyclohexene over prepared catalysts can be interpreted either as an action of an alcoholic (k*l) (k*2) A B C (k*3) Fig. 2.

A detailed description of both mechanisms leading to the increased yield of 1-methylcyclohexene were given elsewhere [1,8,11,12,15,35]. Kinetic parameters (rate constants, orders of reactions), selectivities ((SB = %B/%B + %C)max(B) in a time of an intermediate's maximum concentration in a reaction mixture) and conversions are given in Table 3. The observed rates should be corrected for differences in particle size or degree of dispersion, e.g. by quoting the rates per unit area of the metal. Doing this it was found (Table 3) that originally different values of the rate constants k1 (or k1 ) are comparable (k] or kl').

The titration of surface metal atoms is not always straightforward (e.g., stoichiometry of the hydrogen chemisorption can itself be particle size dependent) [30,36] and even the application of electron microscopy to particles about 1 nm is fraught with difficulties [36]. Reactions carried out on the most active catalyst supported on silica (Ru-S-5) proceeded also with the highest selectivity to the intermediate. Comparing physical and kinetic properties of the catalysts Ru-S-1 (HTR) and Ru-S-5 (LTR) coming from identical initial components, it is seen that the LTR procedure gave us more active and more selective catalysts than the HTR procedure. The pore distribution curves obtained by the nitrogen adsorption showed the pore size for the Ru-S-5 catalyst below 2 nm and for the Ru-S-1 catalyst below 5 nm. No dramatic differences in activity and selectivity were found when using Ru-S-2 (HTR), Ru-S-6 (LTR) and Ru-S-3 (HTR), Ru-S-7 (LTR) catalysts. No effects of modification of the catalysts Ru-S-3 and Ru-S-7 with sodium ions were observed. The catalysts Ru-S-4, Ru-S-8 with a silica-active charcoal support were also very active, however, selectivities of the reactions performed on them were rather poor. Experiments carried out in a mixture of methanol and water proceeded with higher selectivity to 1-methylcyclohexene than corresponding experiments in methanol without considerable effect on activities of the catalysts (Ru-S-1, Ru-S-5). The optimum ratio (mol-% of water/mol-% of methanol)= 1/3 regarding both the selectivity of the reaction and the activity of the catalysts was evaluated on the basis of a number of orientation experiments. A typical course of the reaction is given in Fig. 4. A short initial induction period on a curve -- concentration of toluene vs. time -- was observed. Such a behavior was typical for experiments carried out in the presence of water and was interpreted as establishing a surface adsorption equilibrium [35].

Kluson et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 331-339 more questionable [37] to correlate the metal particle size with the kinetic constants because the reactions are carried out under mass transfer limitations. When using Ru-S-1, Ru-S-4, Ru-S-5 and Ru-S-8 catalysts no deactivation occurred as was separately confirmed by addition of a fresh substrate at the end of the reaction. Activities of other catalysts were decreasing during hydrogena- tion and the reaction stopped at the conversions given in Table 3. Deactivation was probably caused by non-specified surface deposits formed in alkylation reactions of the intermediates and products in an adsorbed state [38]. It is obvious that the catalysts with a lower surface area of ruthenium suffered more from the activity decrease. The evaluated kinetic parameters k3 for all the catalysts excluding Ru-S-4 and Ru-S-8 (Table 3) were not statistically significant because of the low reaction rate of the side reaction (Fig. 2) and limited precision of the experimen- tal data. The confidence intervals for all the other evaluated parameters were incorporated into the truncation of the regression parameters. 4. Conclusion It was shown that under the studied conditions ruthenium catalysts supported on silica prepared by the sol-gel method were able to convert toluene to 1-methylcyclohexene even without a presence of water. However, it was also shown that the presence of water was advantageous regarding the selectivity of the reaction to the intermediate without a serious effect on activity of the catalysts. The sol-gel procedure typically leads to the catalysts with very high total surface area. However, not only high total surface but also a sufficiently specific surface area of ruthenium must be secured in the preparation seeking of the increased selectivity to 1-methylcyclohexene.

APCATA 96002785 S0926-860X(96)00278-5 10.1016/S0926-860X(96)00278-5 Article Selective hydrogenation of toluene over ruthenium catalysts prepared by the sol-gel method Petr Kluson Jiri Had Zdenek Belohlav Libor Cerveny ∗ Institute of Chemical Technology — ICT Prague, Technicka 5, 166 28 Prague 6, Czech Republic ∗ Corresponding author. A group of ruthenium supported catalysts (silica or silica-active charcoal supports) were prepared by the sol-gel method with the aim of obtaining high yields of methylcyclohexene in hydrogenation of toluene. The catalysts differed in composition and in conditions of reduction of their precursors. It was found that the hydrogenation could proceed as a consecutive reaction and that this pathway was accompanied by a parallel direct formation of methylcyclohexane from toluene. A positive role of water in a reaction mixture in view of an increased methylcyclohexene yield was also shown. Keywords Ruthenium Sol-gel Partial hydrogenation toluene References [1] S. Niwa F.
