Chuang*, Kanchan Ghosal Department of Chemical Engineering, The University of Akron, Akron, OH, 44325, USA (Received 29 November 1993; revised 8 March 1994; accepted 8 March 1994) Abstract The effects of copper on carbon monoxide adsorption and carbon monoxide hydrogenation over Rh/SiOZ have been studied. Copper decreases the activity for carbon monoxide hydrogenation and the rate of formation of methane, CZ and C3 + hydrocarbons. The selectivity for CZ oxygenate formation shows a slight variation with addition of copper. Cu-Rh/SiOz catalyst with copper-to-rhodium ratio of 1.0 exhibits a high initial methanol selectivity which decreases with reaction time. The use of ethylene hydroformylation as a probe reaction shows that addition of copper causes little variation in carbon monoxide insertion activity; the propionaldehyde selectivity at copper-to-rhodium ratio of 0.05 is higher than that for the other catalysts studied. In situ infrared study reveals that copper blocks the formation of bridged CO. However, blockage of bridged CO site does not lead to enhancement in carbon monoxide insertion as observed with Ag-Rh/SiOZ and sulfided Rh/Si02 catalysts. The lack of effect of copper promotion on carbon monoxide insertion can be attributed to a high hydrogenation activity of copper and a possible electronic interaction between copper and rhodium leading to a reduced rhodium surface that is less active for carbon monoxide insertion than the oxidized rhodium. The difference observed in the infrared spectra of adsorbed carbon monoxide at 303 K and 513 K in the presence and absence of reactants shows that carbon monoxide induces surface reconstruction at 513 K. Results of catalyst characterization at 303 K can not be extrapolated to elucidate the state of catalyst surface under reaction conditions.

Krishnamurthy et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994)109-125 cations in processes such as reforming, dehydrogenation, dehydrocyclization, and hydrogenolysis reactions. The advantages of using bimetallic catalysts include their high activity, high selectivity, and improved resistance to deactivation. The activity and selectivity of a bimetallic catalyst are governed by its surface state and structure that can be modified by the metal additive. Due to their neutrality and inertness, Group IB metals can be added to Group VIII metals to form a model system for studying the ensemble and ligand effects for hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, isomerization, reforming, hydroformylation, and hydrogenolysis reactions [ 5 ] . Investigations on Cu-Rh/Si02 catalysts for benzene hydrogenation and alkane conversion have shown that copper has a minor influence on the electronic density of the rhodium atoms. It is suggested that copper plays a major role in the dilution of the rhodium surface [ 8 ] . Studies on Cu-Ru, Cu-0s, and Cu-Ni systems for dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions reveal that the active metal atom is diluted by copper, the inactive component, which is randomly dispersed on the catalyst surface [ 5 ] . The inertness of gold allows the use of Au-Ir/Si02 to study the effect of ensemble size on the rate and selectivity of hydrogenolysis reactions [9]. The activity and selectivity of supported rhodium for carbon monoxide hydrogenation and ethylene hydroformylation are a strong function of support and promoter composition [ 10-20] . The effects of promoter (i.e., additive) on the catalyst activity and selectivity can be summarized as follows: (i) modification due to electronic effect of the additives, (ii) interaction of the additives with adsorbed reactant and intermediates, and (iii) geometric blocking of the surface sites. Alkali promoters exhibit electronic effects which suppress hydrogenation of carbon monoxide and possibly increase carbon monoxide dissociation activity [ 13,21 ] . Additives such as Mn, Ti, and Zr have been suggested to interact with the adsorbed carbon monoxide, thus enhancing carbon monoxide insertion and dissociation activity [ 22 ] . Carbon monoxide adsorbed on platinum of a Pt-Ru bimetallic catalyst dissociates readily at room temperature possibly due to a Ru-Pt dual site in which the ruthenium site interacts with the oxygen dissociated from adsorbed carbon monoxide [ 23 ] . Group IB metals, such as Cu, Ag, and Au, have electronegativities similar to that of Group VIII metals and exhibit low activity for hydrocarbon synthesis, ethylene hydroformylation, and alkane hydrogenolysis reactions [ 1,24] . A study of Group IB-Group VIII bimetallic catalysts may help elucidate the blockage effects caused by a metal additive on a supported Group VIII metal catalyst. The silver atoms disperse on the surface of rhodium causing disruption of the rhodium ensembles as indicated by decrease in ethane hydrogenolysis activity and in the ratio of bridged CO to linear CO on Si02 supported Ag-Rh catalysts [ 25 ] . Blocking of the bridged CO site by the addition of silver on Rh/Si02 catalyst enhances carbon monoxide insertion activity resulting in an increase in the rate of formation for CZ oxygenates [7,25]. The distribution of silver and its crystallite size on the Ag-Rh/Si02 catalysts depend on catalyst preparation techniques and the precursor used [ 26 ] . R. Krishnamurthy et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994)109-125 111 Copper supported on ZnO has been proved to be a good methanol synthesis catalyst [27,28]. Silica supported copper catalysts have shown some activity for methanol synthesis [29,30]. Copper has been found to increase the selectivity for methanol formation over a Pd/Si02 catalyst [29]. Addition of both copper and silver as promoters to Rh/Si02 catalyst improved the selectivity for methanol and C2 oxygenate synthesis [ 31 ] . However, the role of copper in C2 oxygenate synthesis over rhodium catalysts remains unclear. The objectives of this work were to study the adsorption of carbon monoxide on the surface of Cu-Rh / Si02 catalyst and to investigate the effect of copper on carbon monoxide hydrogenation and ethylene hydroformylation reactions on Rh/Si02 catalysts, specifically for carbon monoxide insertion. The surface state and structure of the catalyst were characterized using X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy (IR) of adsorbed carbon monoxide, ethane hydrogenolysis, and temperature-programmed desorption of hydrogen. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The 3 wt.-% Rh/Si02 catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of large pore silica (Strem Chemicals, 350 m2/g) using rhodium nitrate solution. The 3 wt.-% Cu/Si02 catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of silica using cupric nitrate solution. Cu-Rh/Si02 catalysts containing 3 wt.-% Rh were prepared by coimpregnation of silicausing cupric nitrate [Cu(N03)2 . 3H20] and rhodium nitrate [ Rh (N03) 3 - 3H20 ] solutions. The ratio of the solution to the weight of support material used was 1 cm3 to 1 g. Cu-Rh catalysts with copper-torhodium molar ratios of 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 were prepared. After impregnation, the catalyst samples were dried overnight in air at 303 K and reduced in a flow of hydrogen at 673 K for 16 hr. 2.2. Catalyst characterization The average copper and rhodium crystallite sizes were determined by a Philips APD3700 X-ray diffractometer using line-broadening technique. Temperatureprogrammed desorption (TPD) of hydrogen was carried out to determine the uptake of hydrogen on the catalyst surface. Following the exposure of the catalyst to hydrogen between 673 K and 303 K, TPD experiments were carried out in an Altamira (AMI-1) TPD unit in flowing argon from 303 K to 673 K at 20 K/min, and the temperature maintained at 673 K for 15 min. The amount of hydrogen adsorbed is equivalent to the area under the H2 TPD profiie [ 32 ] . Adsorption of carbon monoxide at 0.1 MPa and 1.0 MPa on the Rh/Si02 and Cu-Rh/Si02 catalysts was studied in an IR cell at 303 K and 513 K [ 33 ] . The catalysts were 112 R. Krishnamurthy et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994)109-125 ground to a fine powder and pressed into a disk approximately 10 mm in diameter, 1 mm in thickness, and weighing 20 mg. Prior to adsorption studies, the catalyst sample was re-reduced by flowing hydrogen in the IR cell at 513 K for 2 h. IR spectra of the adsorbed species were recorded by a FT-IR spectrometer with a DTGS detector at a resolution of 4 cm-1. 2.3. Reaction studies CO hydrogenation (CO:H2 =1:1) and ethylene hydroformylation (CO:H2:C2H4=1:1:0.02) studies were performed in a stainless steel differential reactor system under steady-state flow conditions of 383-573 K, 0.1 and 1.0 MPa. Space velocities of 1100-11 000 h-1 were maintained to keep the conversion of carbon monoxide below 5%. The products in the effluent stream were analyzed using an HP 5890A gas chromatograph with a 6 ft. Porapak PS column in series with a 6 ft. Porapak QS column. Ethane hydrogenolysis studies were also conducted in the stainless steel reactor (C2H6:H2=1:6) under 383-573 K and 0.1 MPa. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Carbon monoxide adsorption The infrared spectra of carbon monoxide adsorption on Rh/Si02 and Cu-Rh/ Si02 catalysts at 303 K and 0.1 MPa followed by 3 to 5 min of flushing by helium are shown in Fig. 1.

Krishnarnurthy et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994)109-125 113 in any noticeable change in the intensity of adsorbed carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide adsorption on Rh/Si02 catalysts produced a linear CO band at 2070 cm-', bridged CO band at 1894 cm-', and gem-dicarbonyl bands at 2102 and 2036 cm-'. The infrared spectra observed are essentially the same as those reported in our previous studies [ 33,34] . Gem-dicarbonyl has been observed on both the reduced and oxidized Rh/Si02 catalysts despite in situ reduction of the catalysts [ 33 ] . Gem-dicarbonyl is produced from the reaction of surface hydroxyl groups with linear CO on Rho site [35,36]. The assignment of these bands agrees well with those reported in literature [ 35-37 ] . The addition of copper to Rh/Si02 drastically modified the adsorption characteristics of the catalyst. A band in the range 2124-2130 cm-' was produced from carbon monoxide adsorption on Cu-Rh/Si02 catalysts. This band may be assigned to a linear CO adsorbed on Cu' site. It has been reported that carbon monoxide adsorption on CU +/Si02 produces a band at 2127 cm-' [27]. Carbon monoxide adsorption on reduced CU/Si02 produces a band in the range 2104-2099 cm-' while single crystal studies on Cu(100) show an adsorption peak for carbon monoxide in the range 2079-2088 cm-' [27,38]. The intensity of the linear CO adsorbed on Cu' observed on all Cu-Rh/Si02 catalysts varied with the ratio of copper to rhodium. The wavenumber of this adsorbed CO band decreased to 2124 cm-'for Cu-Rh/Si02(1:1). The band at 2130 cm-' was the only adsorbed peak observed for the Cu-Rh/Si02(2:1) catalyst suggesting that copper may have achieved at least monolayer coverage, thus blocking all the rhodium sites that adsorb carbon monoxide. Cu on the Cu-Rh/Si02 catalysts appears to spread on the rhodium surface causing suppression of the formation of bridged CO as indicated by the decrease in intensity of the bridged CO band. Results of X-ray diffraction showed that the Cu-Rh/Si02 catalysts did not exhibit any peaks in the X-ray diffraction pattern indicating that the size of copper and rhodium crystallites on the Cu-Rh/Si02 catalysts is less than 35 A. Although the copper and rhodium crystallite sizes remain unknown, rhodium surface atom on Cu-Rh catalysts chemisorbs mainly linear CO indicating that the rhodium surface atoms are not in the form of ensembles that chemisorb bridged CO. The lack of ensemble of rhodium surface atom is also supported by a significant decrease in ethane hydrogenolysis activity of Cu-Rh catalysts which will be further discussed. Gem-dicarbonyl species were observed on all the catalysts except Cu-Rh/ Si02(2:1). The intensity of the gem-dicarbonyl bands for Cu-Rh/Si02(0.05:1) and Cu-Rh/Si02(0.25:1) catalysts was higher than that for Rh/Si02. The increase in the intensity of the gem-dicarbonyl bands on Cu-Rh/Si02(0.05: 1) and Cu-Rh/ Si02(0.25:1) catalysts reveals that the low loading of copper not only blocks the bridged CO site but also promotes the formation of gem-dicarbonyl. Thus, the drastic decrease in the intensity of bridged CO on Cu-Rh/Si02(0.05:1) can be attributed to the increase in Rh+ site and blockage of Rh-pair sites brought about by the low copper loading. The wavenumber of the asymmetric vibration of the 114 R.

( X 0.5) Denotes that intensity of the spectrum shown is 0.5 times the actual absorbance intensity. gem-dicarbonyl band varied from 2035 cm-' to 2027 cm-t as Cu/Rh ratio increased from 0.05 to 1.0. The shift in asymmetric vibration of the gem-dicarbonyl band is due to an overlap with other CO bands in the same region. The intensity of the gem-dicarbonyl bands decreased drastically for Cu-Rh/Si02(0.5:1) and CuRh/Si02(1:1) catalysts. An adsorption band at 2004 cm-' on Cu-Rh/ Si02(0.05:1) and Cu-Rh/Si02(0.5:1) may be assigned to a weakly adsorbed rhodium carbonyl [ 39 ] . The reason for the formation of the carbonyl species remains unclear. Fig. 2 shows the infrared spectra of carbon monoxide adsorption at 513 K and 0.1 MPa on all catalysts before the catalyst surface was flushed with helium. Flowing helium for 2-3 min removed all the gaseous carbon monoxide and caused a decrease in the intensity and wavenumber of adsorbed carbon monoxide as shown in Fig. 3. It should be noted that, for the same scale factor, the scale lengths for absorbance intensity in Figs. 2 and 3 are different. The decrease in intensity of adsorbed carbon monoxide during helium flush can be attributed to the desorption of adsorbed CO; the decrease in wavenumber could be due to the reduction in dipole-dipole coupling as a result of low coverage of adsorbed carbon monoxide [40]. On the Rh/Si02 and Cu-Rh/Si02(0.05:1), part of the adsorbed carbon monoxide was converted to carbon dioxide. In contrast, carbon dioxide was not observed for the catalysts containing high loading of copper. Formation of carbon dioxide on Rh/Si02 and Cu-Rh/Si02(0.05:1) suggests that carbon monoxide dissociates on the rhodium surface to form surface carbon and adsorbed oxygen which further reacts with carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide. A higher loading of copper appears to inhibit carbon dioxide formation. Copper may disrupt the R.

At 513 K, carbon monoxide adsorption on Rh/Si02 produced a linear CO band at 2042 cm-' and a bridged CO band at 1810 cm-'. Carbon monoxide adsorption on Cu-Rh/Si02(0.05:1) catalyst produced an adsorbed linear CO band at 2037 cm-' and a weak bridged CO at 1892 cm-'. The intensity of the linear CO band in the range 2034-2046 cm-' observed on all Cu-Rh/Si02 catalysts decreased with an increase in copperto-rhodium ratio. The Cu-Rh/Si02(1:1) catalyst also exhibited an additional adsorption band at 2130 cm-' attributed to the carbon monoxide adsorbed on Cu' and a weak adsorption bands at 2096 cm-' and 2034 cm'. The 2096 cm-' and 2034 cm-' bands may be due to the gem-dicarbonyl species. These two bands may also be assigned to carbon monoxide on the reduced copper sites [42] and carbon monoxide on Rho sites, respectively. The present results are not able to distinguish between these possible assignments. The difference observed in infrared spectra for adsorbed carbon monoxide at 303 K and that at 513 K indicates that carbon monoxide induces surface reconstruction. Carbon monoxide is known to promote the reductive agglomeration of Rh+ to the rhodium crystallite at temperatures above 448 K. Furthermore, the reduction of the Rh+ sites by the hydrogen to Rhx species at temperatures above 448 K promotes the agglomerization of Rh+ and prevents the formation of gem-dicarbonyl species [ 34,35,43 ] . The absence of gem-dicarbonyl on all catalysts except Cu-Rh/Si02(1:1) suggests that the Rh+ sites have been reduced at 513 K. The observation of linear CO at 2046 cm-' on Cu-Rh/Si02(2:1) at 513 K suggests that the copper monolayer present at 303 K may have been partly broken up at high temperatures allowing the exposed rhodium atom to chemisorb linear CO. It has 116 R.

Ethane hydrogenolysis Ethane hydrogenolysis studies were carried out at 493 K and 0.1 MPa over Rh/ Si02 andCU-n/Si02catalysts as shown in Table 1. Methane was the only product formed during the hydrogenolysis of ethane. The overall rate for ethane hydrogenolysis decreased with an increase in copper-to-rhodium ratio to 1.0 and then slightly increased for the Cu-Rh/Si02(2: 1) catalyst. The increase in hydrogenolysis activity exhibited by Cu-Rh/Si02(2: 1) catalyst could be due to the breakup of copper monolayer at high temperatures that is also seen by the formation of linear CO on rhodium site during carbon monoxide adsorption studies at 513 K. The amount of hydrogen chemisorbed exhibits a decrease with increasing copper content. There is no obvious relation between hydrogen uptake and hydrogenolysis activity. CU/Si02 is known to chemisorb hydrogen below room temperature [ 27,45 ] but little chemisorption is observed at room temperature [ 8,45 ] . Pulse hydrogen chemisorption studies at 303 K show that 3 wt.-% CU/Si02 chemisorbs a small amount of hydrogen which can not be accurately quantified by our mass spectrometric analysis of the effluent from the reactor. CU/Si02 also exhibits very low activity for ethane hydrogenolysis. The significant decrease observed in hydrogenolysis activity on addition of copper to rhodium could be due to dispersed distribution of copper on rhodium resulting in a decrease in rhodium ensemble size for the hydrogenolysis reaction. The crystallite size of copper and rhodium determined from XRD studies were smaller than 35 A for all the catalysts. This is in contrast to the distribution of silver on Rh/Si02; part of the silver forms large silver R.

The infrared spectra for carbon monoxide hydrogenation over CuRh/Si02 catalysts at 0.1 MPa exhibit an adsorbed carbon monoxide peak in the range 2039-2046 cm-' attributed to the linear CO on rhodium whose intensity decreases with an increase in the amount of copper. Increasing reaction pressure increased the wavenumber of the linear CO band but slightly decreased the intensity of linear CO and completely suppressed bridged CO band. Subtraction of gaseous CO band from the infrared spectra did not produce any additional information about adsorbed carbon monoxide because the vibrational-rotational lines in the R-branch of gaseous carbon monoxide bands cover any weak adsorption bands in the region. An analysis of the effluents from the IR reactor cell at 513 K and 1.0 MPa showed methane as the major product and C2+ hydrocarbons and acetaldehyde as minor products over Rh/Si02 catalyst [ 25 ] . Under the same condition, methane was the major product observed during carbon monoxide hydrogenation over all the CuRh/Si02 catalysts. The results are consistent with those determined from differential reactor studies under similar conditions. 118 R. Krishnamurthy et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994)109-125 Carbon monoxide hydrogenation over Rh/Si02 and Cu-Rh/Si02 produced methane as the major product and C2+ hydrocarbons at 483-573 K and 0.1 MPa. Increase in reaction pressure to 1.0 MPa resulted in the formation of acetaldehyde at 543 K. Table 2 lists the rate of product formation and selectivity data taken after 30 min of reaction carried out in a differential reactor at 543 K and 1.0 MPa. After 30 min of reaction, all the catalysts except for Cu-RhSi02(1:1) and CuRhSi02(2:1) exhibited stable activity and selectivity for the entire 180 min of reaction studies. Catalyst deactivation studies were not attempted; deactivation functions for the reaction were not determined. The selectivity of CU/Si02 is included in Table 2 for comparison. CU/Si02 catalyst did not exhibit any methanol synthesis activity under the conditions of this study. The addition of a small amount of copper to Rh/Si02 decreased the rate of carbon monoxide conversion. No distinct variation in the CZ oxygenate selectivity was observed with change in copper content of the catalysts except the high methanol selectivity exhibited by Cu-Rh/Si02(1:1) and a high C3 oxygenate selectivity shown by Cu-Rh/Si02(2: 1). Methanol selectivity over Cu-Rh/Si02(1:1) and C3 oxygenate selectivity on Cu-Rh/Si02(2:1) decrease with reaction time [ 46 ] . A 30% decrease in methanol selectivity over Cu-Rh/Si02(l:l) anda70% decrease in C3 oxygenate selectivity over Cu-Rh/Si02 (2:1) is observed after 50 and 60 min of reaction, respectively, before reaching a stable steady state. Increase in temperature to 573 K led to a significant decrease in oxygenate selectivity. The nature of active site for methanol formation on Cu-Rh/Si02(1:1) catalyst remains unknown. Both Cu' and Cuhave been suggested to be the site for methanol synthesis over Cu-based catalysts [ 28,47 ] . Despite extensive studies, the site for methanol synthesis remains controversial. Although Cu + sites on the surface that adsorb carbon monoxide in the range 2134-2123 cm-' may provide the site for activation of carbon monoxide for methanol synthesis [27,47], no obvious CO Table 2 Carbon monoxide hydrogenation at 543 K and 1.0 MPa Catalyst Carbon monoxide conversion Selectivity TOF(min-') Rate(mol/kg h) CH4 C HC C+ HC MeCHO EtCHO MeOH Rh/Si020.233 1.87 70.8 4.23 6.29 16.33 0 0.93 Cu-Rh/Si02(0.05:1) 0.032 0.06 83.9 1.30 2.93 11.88 0 0 Cu-Rh/Si02(0.25:1) 0.027 0.16 81.8 1.65 0.63 15.80 0 0 Cu-Rh/Si02(0.5:1) 0.023 0.08 80.1 3.79 0 16.05 0 0 Cu-Rh/Si0=(l:l) 0.033 0.15 61.0 0 0 13.42 0 24.04 Cu-Rh/Si02(2:1) 0.034 0.14 60.5 1.80 0 20.39 17.33 0 Cu/Si026 - 0.32 57.6 17.25 25.16 0 0 0 HC: Hydrocarbons. \"Studies conducted at 548 K.

As a result, the catalyst surface state in carbon monoxide atmosphere can not be used to elucidate the catalyst surface state under reaction conditions. The absence of carbon monoxide on Cu' during reaction may be due to either reduction of Cu + to Cuor the weak interaction between carbon monoxide and Cu '. The change in the surface state of Rh / Si02 and Cu-Rh/Si02 (1:1) before, during, and after reaction may be revealed by comparing the IR spectra of adsorbed carbon monoxide before, during, and after reaction. We have re-investigated the adsorption of carbon monoxide on Rh/Si02 and Cu-Rh/Si02(1:1) catalysts before and after reaction. Fig. 5 shows the infrared spectra of adsorbed carbon monoxide on CuRh/Si02(1:1). IR spectra of adsorbed carbon monoxide on this catalyst before and during reaction are similar to those shown in Figs. 1-4. A broad CO band was observed following the removal of gaseous reactants. The 2130 cm-' band due to carbon monoxide adsorbed on Cu' was slowly developed and the broad CO band shifted slightly upward as temperature decreased. The reappearance of the 2130 cm-' band indicates that copper may remain in an oxidation state of 1 + after reaction. Water and hydroxyl group did not play an important role in the reappearance of carbon monoxide on Cu' since these bands did not change during the cooling process. The formation of the broad CO band which is different from those obtained before reaction indicates that the reaction has modified the rhodium surface. The rhodium surface of the Cu-Rh/Si02(1:1) catalyst after reaction did not return to its initial state as temperature decreased to 303 K.

Linear and bridged CO were observed before, during, and after reaction while gem-dicarbonyl on Rh/Si02 which was absent during reaction reappeared as temperature decreases to 303 K. The close resemblance of IR spectra of adsorbed CO before, during, and after reaction suggests that the surface of Rh/SiOZ returns to its initial state following reaction and cooling to 303 K. The variation of selectivity with temperature for CZ oxygenate formation during carbon monoxide hydrogenation is shown in Fig. 6. The selectivity of CZ oxygenate formation for Rh/Si02 during carbon monoxide hydrogenation increased slightly in the temperature range 483-503 K and decreased with further increase in temperature. The Cz oxygenate selectivity for Cu-Rh/Si02 catalysts showed an increase in the temperature range of 513 to 543 K and decreased with further increase in temperature. The maximum CZ oxygenate selectivity appears to occur around 503 K for Rh/Si02 and 543 K for Cu-Rh/Si02 catalysts.

The rate and selectivity of CZ oxygenate formation depends upon the relative concentration of adsorbed species as well as the rate of specific reaction steps. The variation of CZ oxygenate selectivity with reaction temperature indicates the difference in dependence of these specific reactions on temperature. The shift in temperature for the maximum CZ oxygenate selectivity may be related to the effect of copper on the temperature dependence of the hydrogenation activity and the CH,, concentration. A temperature above 513 K is required for Cu-Rh/Si02 to catalyze sufficient CH., formation for carbon monoxide insertion. As temperature increases above 543 K, hydrogenation competes with carbon monoxide insertion leading to increase in methanation selectivity. 3.4. Ethylene hydroformylation Ethylene hydroformylation is used as a probe reaction to determine the effect of copper on the carbon monoxide insertion activity [ 13,16,25,33 ] . The selectivity and product formation rate during ethylene hydroformylation at 543 K and 1.0 MPa for the Rh/Si02 and Cu-Rh/Si02 catalysts are presented in Table 3. The propionaldehyde selectivity exhibited by all the Cu-Rh/Si02 catalysts was higher than that for Rh/Si02 under this reaction condition. The addition of copper did not noticeably influence the selectivity for ethane except on Cu-Rh/Si02(0.05: 1) for which the ethane selectivity decreased with a corresponding increase in propionaldehyde selectivity. The variation in selectivity of C3 oxygenates with temperature during ethylene hydroformylation reaction is shown in Fig. 8. The C3 oxygenate selectivity decreased with increase in temperature for all the catalysts. The proposed reaction mechanism for the formation of propionaldehyde, ethane, and C3+ hydrocarbons is shown in Fig. 9. Propionaldehyde is formed via the insertion of linearly adsorbed 122 R.

The carbon monoxide insertion step in ethylene hydroformylation closely resembles that in carbon monoxide hydrogenation as discussed earlier [ 13,25 ] . Our previous studies on Ag-Rh catalysts show that the selectivity of CZ oxygenates during carbon monoxide hydrogenation parallels C3 oxygenate selectivity during ethylene hydroformylation reaction [ 25 ] . In the present study, no obvious relation was observed between C2 oxygenate selectivity in carbon monoxide hydrogenation and the C3 oxygenate selectivity in ethylene hydroformylation reaction. The effect of addition of copper on CH.,, formation rate is greater than its effect on carbon monoxide insertion rate during carbon monoxide hydrogenation as indicated by a small variation in C2 oxygenate selectivity. The low rate of carbon monoxide conversion and hydrocarbon formation on Cu-Rh/Si02 catalysts shown in Table 2 can be attributed to the inhibition of CH., formation by copper. Ethylene hydroformylation studies show that copper has little effect on carbon monoxide insertion selectivity except for Cu-Rh/ Si02 (0.05:1) .

Krishnamurthy et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994)109-125 123 as compared to silver-promotion effect suggests that the addition of copper affects the rates for carbon monoxide insertion and hydrogenation of C2H, intermediate to about the same extent for ethylene hydroformylation reaction. The most pronounced effect of copper is to increase the rate of ethylene conversion. Ethylene hydroformylation over CU/Si02 reveals that copper is active for hydrogenation of ethylene, but inactive for carbon monoxide insertion. The ratio of the rate of ethane formation to that for propionaldehyde is about 130 to 1. Copper on the Cu-Rh/Si02 catalysts enhances the hydrogenation rate of the alkene leading to the formation of ethane as indicated by the higher rate of ethane formation shown in Table 3. Although the blockage of bridged CO site by copper should lead to enhancement of carbon monoxide insertion selectivity on Cu-Rh/Si02 catalysts, participation of copper sites for hydrogenation offsets the promotion effect of copper resulting from blocking the bridged CO sites. Silver shows a significantly lower hydrogenation activity for ethylene than copper. Thus, Ag-Rh/Si02 catalysts have a higher selectivity towards oxygenates in comparison to Cu-Rh/Si02 bimetallic catalysts. Another possible reason for the lack of significant copper promotion effect on carbon monoxide insertion may be related to the tendency of charge transfer from the copper to rhodium that occurs on low coverage of copper on Rh(100) [44]. Electronegative rhodium surface atom could exhibit low activity for carbon monoxide insertion. This can be inferred from the fact that Rh+ sites are more active for carbon monoxide insertion than the reduced Rhsites [ 33 ] . Our previous studies on Ag-Rh/Si02 catalysts have shown the formation of linear CO on Rh+ sites on the surface during carbon monoxide adsorption at 301 K [ 25 ] . Rh+ sites were found to be responsible for carbon monoxide insertion over oxidized Rh/Si02 catalysts and a blue shift in the wavenumber for adsorbed carbon monoxide was observed during ethylene hydroformylation. No obvious shift in the wavenumber of adsorbed carbon monoxide was observed to verify the electronegativity of rhodium atom during carbon monoxide hydrogenation over Cu-Rh/Si02 catalysts. 4. Conclusions The effects of addition of copper to Rh/Si02 for carbon monoxide hydrogenation and ethylene hydroformylation are summarized as follows: (1) Copper suppresses the formation of bridged CO on Rh/Si02. (2) The difference observed in infrared studies of carbon monoxide adsorption at 303 K and 513 K in the presence and absence of reactant mixture reveals that carbon monoxide induces surface reconstruction at 513 K. Results of the catalyst characterization at 303 K may not be extended to elucidate the surface state of the working catalyst during reaction. (3) Copper decreases the activity for methane, C2, and C3+ hydrocarbons and the addition of Cu to Rh/Si02 shows a slight variation in the C2 oxygenate selectivity during carbon monoxide hydrogenation. 124 R. Krishnamurthy et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994)109-125 (4) Copper affects the rate of formation of CH, and C2HX species to a greater extent than the carbon monoxide insertion rate during carbon monoxide hydrogenation. (5) Ethylene hydroformylation studies show that addition of copper does not significantly affect carbon monoxide insertion activity and a maximum propionaldehyde selectivity at copper-to-rhodium ratio of 0.05 is obtained. Carbon monoxide insertion selectivity decreases with increase in temperature. (6) The lack of effect of copper on the carbon monoxide insertion selectivity can be related to high hydrogenation activity of copper and a possible electronic interaction between copper and rhodium resulting in a reduced rhodium surface which is less active for carbon monoxide insertion than oxidized rhodium.

The effects of copper on carbon monoxide adsorption and carbon monoxide hydrogenation over Rh/SiO2 have been studied. Copper decreases the activity for carbon monoxide hydrogenation and the rate of formation of methane, C2 and C3+ hydrocarbons. The selectivity for C2 oxygenate formation shows a slight variation with addition of copper. Cu-Rh/SiO2 catalyst with copper-to-rhodium ratio of 1.0 exhibits a high initial methanol selectivity which decreases with reaction time. The use of ethylene hydroformylation as a probe reaction shows that addition of copper causes little variation in carbon monoxide insertion activity; the propionaldehyde selectivity at copper-to-rhodium ratio of 0.05 is higher than that for the other catalysts studied. In situ infrared study reveals that copper blocks the formation of bridged CO. However, blockage of bridged CO site does not lead to enhancement in carbon monoxide insertion as observed with Ag-Rh/SiO2 and sulfided Rh/SiO2 catalysts. The lack of effect of copper promotion on carbon monoxide insertion can be attributed to a high hydrogenation activity of copper and a possible electronic interaction between copper and rhodium leading to a reduced rhodium surface that is less active for carbon monoxide insertion than the oxidized rhodium. The difference observed in the infrared spectra of adsorbed carbon monoxide at 303 K and 513 K in the presence and absence of reactants shows that carbon monoxide induces surface reconstruction at 513 K. Results of catalyst characterization at 303 K can not be extrapolated to elucidate the state of catalyst surface under reaction conditions.

        "dc:description": "The effects of copper on carbon monoxide adsorption and carbon monoxide hydrogenation over Rh/SiO2 have been studied. Copper decreases the activity for carbon monoxide hydrogenation and the rate of formation of methane, C2 and C3+ hydrocarbons. The selectivity for C2 oxygenate formation shows a slight variation with addition of copper. Cu-Rh/SiO2 catalyst with copper-to-rhodium ratio of 1.0 exhibits a high initial methanol selectivity which decreases with reaction time. The use of ethylene hydroformylation as a probe reaction shows that addition of copper causes little variation in carbon monoxide insertion activity; the propionaldehyde selectivity at copper-to-rhodium ratio of 0.05 is higher than that for the other catalysts studied. In situ infrared study reveals that copper blocks the formation of bridged CO. However, blockage of bridged CO site does not lead to enhancement in carbon monoxide insertion as observed with Ag-Rh/SiO2 and sulfided Rh/SiO2 catalysts. The lack of effect of copper promotion on carbon monoxide insertion can be attributed to a high hydrogenation activity of copper and a possible electronic interaction between copper and rhodium leading to a reduced rhodium surface that is less active for carbon monoxide insertion than the oxidized rhodium. The difference observed in the infrared spectra of adsorbed carbon monoxide at 303 K and 513 K in the presence and absence of reactants shows that carbon monoxide induces surface reconstruction at 513 K. Results of catalyst characterization at 303 K can not be extrapolated to elucidate the state of catalyst surface under reaction conditions.",
