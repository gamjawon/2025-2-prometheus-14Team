Wang, C.T. Au* Department of Chemistry, Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong Received 24 July 1996; received in revised form 11 November 1996; accepted 13 November 1996 Abstract The decomposition of CH4 and CO2 as well as the reaction between CH4 and CO2 over SiO2- supported rhodium catalysts has been investigated in the temperature range of 600-800 over a pulse reactor. The initial activities for methane decomposition and CO2 decomposition increased with the increase of rhodium loading; whereas the activity for CO formation in the CH4+CO2 reaction was almost unaffected by the rhodium loading over catalysts with rhodium loading >0.05%. Different reaction behaviors of methane reforming with CO2 were observed at 700 and 800. At 700, CO2 conversion was higher than CH4 conversion; whereas at 800, CH4 conversion was higher than CO2 conversion. The bond order conservation-Morse potential (BOC- MP) calculations indicate that the oxygen at on-top site can promote the dissociation of methane on the Rh(111) surface. Normal deuterium isotope effect was observed to be more noticeable on the methane conversion reaction than on the CO formation reaction, while no such effect was observed on the CQ conversion reaction. The mechanism for CO and H2 formation in the reforming of methane with CO2 is discussed based on the results of the present work.

This process has advantages over the steam reforming of methane, as the syngas produced is with low H2/CO ratio and is more suitable for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to liquid hydrocarbons. The process also has important environmental implication as both methane and carbon dioxide * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Supported rhodium is one of the most effective catalysts for this process and has advantage over other metals because of its coking-free nature. Concerning the mechanism of CO2-reforming of methane over catalysts based on Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir and Pt, etc. in general, the following steps are supposed to be involved in the reaction [1,2]: CO2,g --+ COs Os CH4,g ~ CHx,s (4 - x)Hs CHx,s + Os ~ Os + xHs COs ---+ COg 2H~ ~ H2,g (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) However, controversies still exist. Kim et al. [3] concluded that the cleavage of the C-H bond in methane is rate-determining over Ni-based catalysts, whereas Nakamura et al. [4] suggested that CO2 dissociation is the rate-determining step over supported Rh catalysts. Solymosi and coworkers [5] inferred that the activation and dissociation of CO2 do not play an important role in the reforming of methane over supported Rh catalysts. In addition, for the dissociation of CH4, oxygen-assisted dissociation of CH4 was suggested by Solymosi and coworkers [5]. For CO formation pathway, besides reaction (C), Cs+OHs---~COs+Hs was supposed to be an alternative by Verykios and coworkers over supported Rh catalysts [6]. In the present work, the dissociation of CH4 and CO2, as well as the CH4+CO2 reaction was investigated over Rh/SiO2 catalysts with 0.02-8.0% rhodium load- ings using pulse technique in the temperature range of 600-800. Deuterium isotope effects were investigated at 700 by performing the CH4O2 and CD4+CO2 reactions alternately. In addition, the activation energies for methane dissociation with or without the involvement of chemisorbed oxygen on Rh(111) surface were calculated by means of the bond order conservation-Morse potential (BOC-MP) approach. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst The SiO2-supported rhodium catalysts developed in our laboratory were prepared by impregnating SiO2 granule with RhC13.3H20 methanol solution, followed by drying at ll0 for 12h and calcining at 500 for 2h for decomposition. The catalysts were reduced with H2 at 500 for 1 h before use. The dispersion of rhodium in catalyst was determined by H2-O2 titration at 25 using the pulse technique and the results are presented in Table 1. H.Y. Wang, C.T.

CEstimated. 2.2. Pulse reaction Pulse reaction apparatus has been described previously [7], only the reactor used this time was made of quartz tube with 4 mm i.d. During the pulse experiments, there was a constant flow of helium through the reactor and the reactant gas mixture was flushed in by the carrier gas. For each study, 50 mg of catalyst was used and the pulse volume of methane/carbon dioxide (1/1) was 1.03 ml. The reactants and products were analyzed on-line by a Shimadzu GC-8A gas chromatograph equipped with TCD (MS5A and Porapak Q as columns). The blank runs with CH4]CO2 (1/1) mixture showed 1.2% and 10.1% of methane conversion at 700 and 800, respectively, due to gas-phase reaction. The yield of CO is defined as CO yield (%)= nout,CO/(nout,CH4 + nout,CO2 + nout,co)100%, where n is the total amount of molecules (mol). 2.3. Deuterium isotope effects The experiment was carried out in such a manner that at first CH4/CO2 was pulsed over the pre-reduced catalyst to perform the CH4+CO2 reaction; after the eighth CH4]CO2 pulse, the CD4+CO2 reaction was carried out by pulsing in CD4/CO2 instead. By performing the CH4+CO2 and CD4+CO2 reactions alter- nately in this way, deuterium isotope effects could be investigated. Average values of methane conversion, CO2 conversion and CO yield in the CH4q-CO2 and CD4+CO2 reactions were calculated with the exclusion of the first two points in each set of the eight reaction points. The relative ratios of methane conversion, CO2 conversion and CO yield in the CH4+CO2 reaction to the corresponding ones in the CD4+CO2 reaction were used to express the magnitude of deuterium isotope effects. 242 H.Y Wang, C.T. Au/Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 239-252 2.4. BOC-MP calculation The bond order conservation-Morse potential approach was developed by Shustorovich [8]. It has been applied successfully in the calculations of adsorption heats of reactants, intermediates and products as well as activation energies for elementary processes over transition metals [9-11]. In the present study, the method was used to evaluate the activation energies and reaction enthalpies for the elementary steps of methane dissociation with or without the involvement of chemisorbed oxygen on Rh(111) surface. Three types of adsorbed oxygen species located at on-top, bridge and hollow sites were considered. 3. Results 3.1. Methane decomposition over reduced Rh/Si02 The interaction of methane pulses with the reduced rhodium catalysts were investigated at 700. H2 and CO were detected as products. When O2 was pulsed in instead after the eighteenth pulse of methane, CO and CO2 were detected over the catalysts with Rh loadings higher than 0.05%. The result indicates that surface carbon species were formed during the previous interaction of methane with the reduced rhodium catalysts. The amount of surface carbon formed at each reaction point was evaluated according to the carbon balance. Fig. 1 shows the variation of methane conversion and the yield of surface carbon as a function of the number of methane pulses. Over the 0.05% Rh]SiO2 catalyst, methane conversion stayed at around 5%. Over the 0.5% Rh]SiO2 catalyst, methane conversion decreased gradually from ca. 13% at the first point to ca. 7.5% at the fifth point and then stayed at this level. For the 2.0% Rh]SiO2 catalyst, methane conversion was initially about 30% and declined rapidly during the first five pulses and then decreased gradually to reach ca. 13.5% at the eighteenth pulse. With the 8.0% Rh/SiO2 catalyst, methane conversion decreased rapidly from ca. 40% at the first pulse to ca. 16.5% at the seventh pulse and then decreased gradually to ca.12% at the eighteenth pulse. The yield of surface carbon shows trend similar to that of methane conversion over the reduced catalysts except for the 0.05% Rh/SiO2 catalyst. The results indicate that the catalysts with higher rhodium loading have higher ability for methane dissociation and the occupancy of the active sites by carbon species could be the reason for the decline in methane conversion. 3.2.

The formation of CO and the rapid decrease in the activity for CO2 decomposition suggest the occurrence of CO2,g---~COg+Os (dissociation of certain amount of CO could occur as well) and the rapid incorporation of the surface oxygen into the bulk with rhodium oxide formation. To compare the reactivity of rhodium catalysts with different rhodium loadings for CO2 decomposition, CO yield in the first reaction point of CO2 pulses were adopted for consideration. As 244 H.Y.

Dependence of CO yield on Rh loading in the first reaction point of CO2 decomposition over Rh/SiO2 catalysts at 600 (O), 700 (I) and 800 (A). shown in Fig. 2, over all the rhodium catalysts, at the temperature range of 600- 800, CO yield was less than 4%. At 600 and 700, with the increase in rhodium loading from 0.02% to 8.0%, CO yield only increased slightly; whereas at 800, it increased greatly when rhodium loading reached 8.0%. CO yield increased more noticeably with the increase in temperature from 700 to 800 than that from 600 to 700. The results indicate that with the increase in rhodium loading and temperature, the initial activity for CO2 decomposition increased. Solymosi and coworkers [5] employed IR spectroscopy to monitor the product of CO2 dissociation over Rh-based catalysts at the temperature range of 200-400 and observed a weak absorption band at 2020-2035 cm ~ due to linearly bonded CO, indicative of the dissociation of CO2. They also pointed out that the deep dissociation of CO2 may take place at much higher temperature. 3.3. CH4+C02 reaction over reduced Rh/Si02 Fig. 3 shows the effect of rhodium loading on CO yield (the average value of eight reaction points) in CH4+CO2 reaction at the temperature range of 600- 800. At 600, with the increase in rhodium loading from 0.02% to 0.5%, CO yield increased; further increase in rhodium loading had almost no effect on the yield of CO. At 700, with the increase in rhodium loading from 0.02% to 0.1%, CO yield increased; also, further increase in rhodium loading had almost no effect on the CO formation activity. At 800, catalysts with Rh loadings _>0.05% had similar CO yield.

CO2 at 700 and 800 were compared as a function of rhodium loading. Since both the maximum and minimum conversions of CH4 and CO2 were included, the patterns in Fig. 6 would be representative. Over catalysts with rhodium loadings from 0.05% to 8.0%, at 700, CO2 conversion was higher than CH4 conversion; whereas at 800, CH4 conversion was higher than CO2 conversion and the difference between these two conversions increased with the increase of rhodium loading. 3.4. Deuterium isotope effects in reforming reaction of methane with C02 Fig. 7 shows the variation of methane conversion, CO2 conversion and CO yield over the 0.5% Rh/SiO2 catalyst at 700 as a function of the number of methane/ carbon dioxide pulses. When CH4+CO2 reaction was alternated to CD4+CO2, methane conversion decreased noticeably (by ca. 5%); conversely, when CD4+CO2 was changed to CH4+CO2, methane conversion increased noticeably. The results indicate that methane conversion reaction showed a normal deuterium isotope effect. Other than a smaller extent of fluctuation, the trend of CO formation rate was similar to that of methane conversion, indicating the existence of normal deuterium isotope effect on the rate of CO formation reaction. However, compared with that of methane conversion and CO formation rate, CO2 conversion follows a different trend. With the exclusion of the first reaction point of CH4/COe pulses, where stable state has not been reached, CO2 conversion stayed at almost the same level (<0.7% of fluctuation) during the alternations of CH4-~-CO2 and CD4+CO2 248 H.Y Wang, C.T. Au/Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 239-252 reactions, indicating that there was no normal deuterium isotope effect on the rate of CO2 conversion reaction. Over other rhodium catalysts with higher Rh loadings, similar results were observed. 4. Discussion Based on the results of the present work, the mechanism for the formation of CO and H2 in the reforming of methane with CO2 can be described appropriately by the following elementary reaction steps: CH4,g ---+ CH4,s CO2,g ~ CO2,s CH4,s ---* CHx,s + (4 - x)Hs CH4,s + Os ----+ CH3,s + OHs CO2,s ~ COs -+- Os CO2,~ + Hs ~ COs + OH~ COs ~ Cs + O~ CHx,s + O~ ~ COs + xHs O~ + Hs ~ OHs CHs + OHs ~ COs + Hz,s Cs + OHs --~ COs + Hs OH~ + Hs -* H2Os (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) During the interaction of methane with the reduced supported rhodium catalysts, surface carbon and CO were formed (Fig. 1). The results imply the dissociative chemisorption of methane and the formation of CO via CHx,s interaction with surface OH groups and/or certain low coordinated oxygens of the SiO2 support. Buyevskaya et al. [12] have previously concluded that surface OH groups of the support can be involved in the conversion of CHx to CO via reforming reaction over 1 wt% RbJAI203 catalyst. During the interaction of CO2 with the reduced Rh/SiO2 catalysts, CO was detected (Fig. 2), indicative of the dissociation of CO2. In the reforming reaction of methane with CO2 at temperatures higher than 600, the activity for CO formation was almost unaffected by rhodium loading when the loading of rhodium was higher than 0.05% (Fig. 3), indicating that the active sites for methane reforming could be small rhodium particles. When CD4 was used instead of CH4 to carry out the reforming reaction, a normal deuterium isotope effect on methane conversion reaction was observed (Fig. 7), indicating that the reforming of methane with CO2 proceeds via surface intermediates produced through methane dehydrogenation. H. 17.. Wang, C.T. Au/Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 239-252 249 For the Os formed in the dissociation of CO2, there exist two possible subsequent reactions, i.e., CHx, s+Os--~Os+xHs (reaction (8)) and Os+Hs--~OHs (reaction (9)) under the reforming conditions. According to the stoichiometry of CH4+CO2= 2COH2, equal conversion for methane and CO2 should be expected in the reforming reaction; but this is not so. As shown in Figs. 4-7, at 700, CO2 conversion was higher than methane conversion. A number of researchers [3-5] have found that H20 was formed and CO/H2 ratio was always higher than one in the CO2-reforming of methane. These results imply that some CO2 is hydrogenated to give CO and H20 (so called the reverse water gas shift reaction: CO2,s+H~ COs+OHs, OH~+H~---+H2Os). The hydrogen-assisted dissociation of CO2 step (reaction (6)) has been suggested previously by Solymosi and coworkers [5]. With resort to the above reaction steps, the results of deuterium isotope effects presented in Fig. 7 can be reasonably explained. When the CH4O2 reaction was changed to the CD4O2, the dissociation rate of methane and the formation rates of CDx,~ species decreased simultaneously due to normal deuterium isotope effect [13]. With the decrease of the formation rate of CD,,~ species, the reaction rate of O~ in the CDx,~+Os---+COs reaction decreased, which would hinder the dissociation of CO2. On the other hand, the reaction rate of Os in the Os+D~---~OD~ reaction increased due to the inverse deuterium isotope effect [14], which would promote the dissociation of CO2. The reaction rate of CO2 in the CO2,s+Ds--+COs+ODs reaction also increased due to inverse deuterium isotope effect. As a result, the normal deuterium isotope effect on the CO2 conversion reaction was counteracted, resulting in almost no change in the overall conversion of CO2. Since there are two different routes for CO formation, i.e., methane molecular route (reaction steps (1), (3), (8), (10) and (11)) and CO2 molecular route (reaction steps (2), (5), (6), (7) and (11)), CO2 conversion stayed at almost the same level during the alternations of CH4O2 and CD4O2. A smaller extent of fluctuation for the rate of CO formation is expected. Solymosi and coworkers [5] have observed that the addition of CO2 to CH4 greatly promoted the dissociation of CH4 over supported rhodium catalysts. They assumed that the dissociation of CH4 was facilitated by the adsorbed Os generated in the decomposition of CO2. Quinlan et al. [ 15] studied the interaction of methane with a Ni(100) surface with pre-adsorbed oxygen atoms by means of vibrational spectroscopy (HREELS) and concluded that oxygen adatoms can greatly promote the dissociative chemisorption of methane on Ni(100). However, Alstrup et al. [16] claimed that no evidence was found for enhanced sticking of methane when oxygen atoms are present on the nickel surface in their XPS studies. To evaluate the likelihood of oxygen-assisted dissociation of methane, the activation energies for elementary steps for methane dissociation with or without the involvement of the adsorbed oxygen species on Rh(111) surface were calculated using BOC-MP method and the results are presented in Tables 2 and 3. It can be seen that the dissociation of methane is strongly activated. Compared with the direct dissocia- tion of methane, methane dissociation reactions involving Os located at on-top sites 250 H.Y.

Thus, we concluded that besides the direct dissociation of methane, oxygen-assisted dis- sociation (reaction (4)) could be another pathway for methane dissociation. As the dispersion of rhodium decreased with the increase in rhodium loading (Table 1), it can be assumed that the relative amount of on-top oxygen species over the catalysts during CH4+CO2 reaction decreased with the increase in rhodium loading and the contribution of oxygen-assisted dissociation of methane also decreased with the increase of rhodium loading. As shown in Figs. 4-6, at 800, methane conversion was higher than CO2 conversion; whereas CO2 conversion was higher than methane conversion at 700. As shown in Fig. 2, the initial activity for CO2 decomposition at 800 was much higher than that at 700. Kim et al. [3] have pointed out that the dissociative reduction of CO2 could lead to CO or surface carbon, together with oxide formation. It can be assumed that the extent of deep dissociation reaction would be much larger at 800 than that at 700 and the surface oxygen formed in the dissociation of CO2 would penetrate into the bulk much faster at 800 than that at 700. Thus, we assumed a small amount of rhodium oxide could be temporally formed at the temperature of 800. As reported in our previous paper [17], oxidation reaction of methane takes place over rhodium oxide even in the absence of gaseous oxygen and rhodium oxide has higher ability for methane conversion than metallic rhodium. Thus, besides the dominant reforming reaction H.Y Wang, C.T. Au/Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 239-252 251 of methane over metallic rhodium sites, some methane would be oxidized to COx (x=l or 2) by the rhodium oxide (with the simultaneous reduction of rhodium oxide to metallic rhodium). This is the reason why methane conversion was higher than CO2 conversion at 800. In addition, since the extent of deep dissociation of CO2 was much larger over the catalysts with higher rhodium loadings, it was expected that the amount of rhodium oxide formed temporally increased with the increase of rhodium loading. This is the reason why the difference between methane conversion and CO2 conversion increased with the increase of rhodium loading. On the other hand, the surface carbon formed in the deep dissociation of CO2 could react with Os or OHs to give CO. BOC-MP calculations indicate the activation energies for Cs+Os~COs (the backward reaction (7)) and Cs+OHs~COs+Hs (reaction (11)) on Rh(lll) surface are 100 and 28 kJ/mol, respectively. The latter is energetically more favorable and might be the main pathway for surface carbon removal. 5. Conclusion (i) At 700, some CO2 is hydrogenated to give CO. (ii) At 800, the deep dissociation of CO2 occurs to significant extent. (iii) There are two possible pathways for methane dissociation, viz. direct dissociation and oxygen-assisted dissociation, and the contribution of the latter decreases with the increase in Rh loading.

Wang C.T. Au ∗ Department of Chemistry, Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong ∗ Corresponding author. The decomposition of CH4 and CO2 as well as the reaction between CH4 and CO2 over SiO2-supported rhodium catalysts has been investigated in the temperature range of 600–800°C over a pulse reactor. The initial activities for methane decomposition and CO2 decomposition increased with the increase of rhodium loading; whereas the activity for CO formation in the CH4+CO2 reaction was almost unaffected by the rhodium loading over catalysts with rhodium loading >0.05%. Different reaction behaviors of methane reforming with CO2 were observed at 700°C and 800°C. At 700°C, CO2 conversion was higher than CH4 conversion; whereas at 800°C, CH4 conversion was higher than CO2 conversion. The bond order conservation-Morse potential (BOCMP) calculations indicate that the oxygen at on-top site can promote the dissociation of methane on the Rh(111) surface. Normal deuterium isotope effect was observed to be more noticeable on the methane conversion reaction than on the CO formation reaction, while no such effect was observed on the CO2 conversion reaction. The mechanism for CO and H2 formation in the reforming of methane with CO2 is discussed based on the results of the present work.
