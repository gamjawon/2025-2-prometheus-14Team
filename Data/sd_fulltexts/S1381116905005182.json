Graphical abstract A MgCl2/AlCl3-supported Ziegler–Natta catalyst is prepared and low isotactic polypropylene is synthesized using this catalyst in the paper. The results indicate that the polymerization activity of the MgCl2/AlCl3-supported Ziegler–Natta catalyst is much higher than that of the MgCl2-supported Ziegler–Natta catalyst. And the attenuation curves of the polymerization rate of different Al/Ti molar ratios suggest the double metal active center is more stable than the single metal active center. Also the effects of the AlCl3/MgCl2 molar ratio, polymerization temperature and external electron donor on the polymerization activity and isotactic index of the products are studied in detail.

Keywords Ziegler–Natta catalyst Polymerization activity Low isotactic polypropylene 1 Introduction Low isotactic polypropylene (LIPP), once regarded as a disposal problem in polypropylene industry, now receives more and more attention and is widely used as adhesives, sealants and coatings, additives for building top grade high way and so on [1,2]. It has been reported that the atactic polypropylene could be synthesized with some metallocene compounds [3–7], but metallocene catalytic system needs a great quantity of expensive methylaluminoxane (MAO) as cocatalyst and the existing equipment and technological process also must be changed if using these metallocene catalystic system. Therefore much effort [8–11] has been put on the development and research of economical MgCl2-supported Ziegler–Natta catalyst to produce LIPP. Using this heterogeneous catalysts the isolated donor-free Ti3+ species having two chlorine vacancies gave low isotactic polypropylene while bi- or multinuclear Ti3+ species gave isotactic one [12]. Based on this mechanism, it may be expected that low isotactic polypropylene is mainly produced by highly dispersed Ti-based catalysts [13]. Therefore, the improvement of the polymerization activity of per-gram catalyst depends on the high specific surface area of the support. Usually MgCl2 is activated through being ball milled under nitrogen atmosphere in industry. After MgCl2 being ball milled for a certain time, longer milling time leads to little further improvement in crystallite size reduction and in crystal lattice destroy and hence the polymerization activity goes to a fixed value [14]. It has been reported that AlCl3 could promote the destroy of the crystal lattice of TiCl3 when TiCl3 and AlCl3 are being co-milled [15]. Due to the similar crystal lattice structure between TiCl3 and MgCl2, the crystal lattice destroy of MgCl2 may be improved when MgCl2 and AlCl3 are being co-milled. Therefore, TiCl4 can be dispersed more uniformly and fixed more firmly on the support of the MgCl2/AlCl3-supported Ziegler–Natta catalyst than that of the MgCl2-supported Ziegler–Natta catalyst. In the paper, a MgCl2/AlCl3-supported Ziegler–Natta catalyst is prepared and low isotactic polypropylene is synthesized. The effects of the AlCl3/MgCl2 molar ratio, polymerization temperature, external electron donor, the Al/Ti molar ratio on the polymerization activity and isotactic index of the products are studied in detail. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and the preparation of the supported catalyst Anhydrous MgCl2 and AlCl3 were used as received. Hexane was refluxed over a Na–K alloy before use. AlEt3 was obtained commercially and used without further purification. Polymerization grade propylene was further purified by passing through two columns of pre-activated molecular sieves 4A. Nitrogen of extra pure grade, 99.99%, was dried to pass through two columns of pre-activated molecular sieves 4A to remove residual moisture and oxygen. Titanium tetrachloride and phenyltriethoxysilane were used as received. The MgCl2/AlCl3-supported Ziegler–Natta catalyst is prepared according to Scheme 1 [16]. 2.2 Propylene polymerization and the determination of the isotactic index of polypropylene Propylene polymerization experiments were carried out in a 100mL, three-necked glass reactor equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Required amounts of hexane, AlEt3 and the catalyst were introduced sequentially. The pressure of propylene was kept at 1atm. Polymerization reactions continued for 30min and the products were precipitated by the addition of acidified alcohol. The resultant polymer was filtered off and dried in vacuum to constant weight. The isotactic index of the resultant polypropylene was determined by the conventional solvent extraction method. The solvent used here was hexane and extraction time was 24h. The insoluble fraction in heptane was defined as the isotactic index of the resultant polypropylene. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of the AlCl3/MgCl2 molar ratio on the propylene polymerization Fig. 1 shows that the effect of the AlCl3/MgCl2 molar ratio on the propylene polymerization activity and isotactic index of polypropylene. The polymerization activity increases when the AlCl3/MgCl2 molar ratio varies from 0 to 0.11 and then decrease. The comparison of the polymerization activity of the MgCl2/AlCl3-supported Ziegler–Natta catalyst and that of the MgCl2-supported Ziegler–Natta catalyst indicates the addition of a little amount of AlCl3 in the process of the ball milling promotes the crystal lattice destroy of MgCl2, which can be explained as follows. Due to the lower lattice energy of AlCl3 lattice than that of MgCl2 lattice, the lattice defects of AlCl3 lattice is more prone to be formed than those of MgCl2 lattice (Reaction (1) and (2), Fig. 2 ). The chlorine vacancies formed because of the defects of AlCl3 lattice may attract the chlorine atoms of MgCl2 lattice and in turn the attraction promotes the formation of the defects of MgCl2 crystal lattice (Reaction (3), Fig. 2). Therefore, TiCl4 can be dispersed more uniformly and fixed more firmly on the support of AlCl3/MgCl2-supported catalyst than that of the MgCl2-supported catalyst. However, the excess amount of AlCl3 leads to the decrease of the polymerization activity. This can be explained that AlCl3 is not an ideal support as MgCl2. Also from Fig. 1, the addition of AlCl3 of AlCl3/MgCl2 supported catalyst have little influence on the isotactic index of polypropylene in comparison with MgCl2 supported catalyst. 3.2 Effect of the polymerization temperature on the propylene polymerization Effect of the polymerization temperature on the polymerization activity and the isotactic index of polypropylene were shown in Fig. 3 . As we know, the increase of the polymerization temperature not only makes the polymerization rate constant increase but also decreases the solubility of propylene gas in the solvent. Just because the contrary influence of polymerization temperature on the two aspects, the maximum of the polymerization activity occurs at 25°C in Fig. 3. The increase of the isotactic index of the resultant polypropylene can be explained as: higher polymerization temperature may convert the single metal active center (structure 1, Fig. 4 ) to double metal active center and double metal active center (structure 2, Fig. 4) is liable to produce high isotactic polypropylene. 3.3 Effect of the Al/Ti molar ratio on the propylene polymerization As Fig. 5 is shown, with the increase of the Al/Ti molar ratio, the polymerization activity firstly increases and then decreases, and the isotactic index of polypropylene increases all the while. The reason is that with the increase of the Al/Ti molar ratio, the Ti4+ is firstly reduced to Ti3+ which possesses the polymerization activity to propylene monomers. However, the excess of the AlEt3 may make Ti3+ further be reduced to Ti2+, which is inactive to propylene monomers, and in turn the polymerization activity decreases. Meanwhile, as we know, single metal active center (structure 1, Fig. 4) is prone to produce the atactic polypropylene and double metal active center tends to produce the highly isotactic polypropylene [17]. Therefore with the increase of the Al/Ti molar ratio, the isotactic index of the resultant polypropylene increases because the conversion of structures 1–2 in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 6 , the speed of deactivation of the lower Al/Ti molar ratio is faster than that of the higher Al/Ti molar ratio. The results indicate that double metal active center (structure 2, Fig. 4) is more stable than single metal active center (structure 1, Fig. 4). 3.4 Effect of the external donor on the propylene polymerization Addition of external donor, phenyltriethoxysilane, in the polymerization system has an adverse influence on the polymerization activity, as shown in Fig. 7 . According to Kakugo [17], the MgCl2-supported Ti catalyst has two kinds of active centers, namely structures 1 and 3 in Fig. 8 . As shown in Fig. 8, the addition of the external donor may convert nonstereospecific center to the high isospecific one (structure 2) and the low isotactic center to an inactive one [18]. Therefore with the increase of the Si/Al molar ratio, the isotactic index of the resultant polypropylene increases. And further increase of the Si/Al molar ratio may result in the reduction of the polymerization activity to a great content. 4 Conclusions A low Ti-loading AlCl3/MgCl2-supported Ziegler–Natta catalyst is prepared and low isotactic polypropylene is synthesized using this catalyst in the paper. The results indicate that the polymerization activity of the AlCl3/MgCl2-supported Ziegler–Natta catalyst is much higher than that of the MgCl2-supported Ziegler–Natta catalyst. And the attenuation curves of the polymerization rate of different Al/Ti molar ratios suggest the double metal active center is more stable than the single metal active center. References [1] V.
