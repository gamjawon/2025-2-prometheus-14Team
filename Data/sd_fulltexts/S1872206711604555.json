HERAVI 2 , Raheleh SAEEDI RAD 1 1 Department of Chemistry, Semnan University, Semnan, Iran 2 Department of Chemistry, School of Science, Azzahra University, Vanak, Tehran, Iran Abstract: Sulfonic acid-functionalized silica-coated nano-Fe 3 O 4 particles (Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -SO 3 H) have been prepared as a novel heteroge- neous acid using a facile process. The material was subsequently identified as an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of a variety of tetraketone derivatives via the Knoevenagel condensation and Michael addition reactions of aromatic aldehydes to dimedone, 1,3-indanedione, and 1,3-dimethyl barbituric acid. The catalyst could be readily recovered using a simple external magnet and reused several times without any significant loss in activity. The current catalytic process is both sustainable and economical because it operates under aqueous conditions, the catalyst can be recovered and reused, and the reactions themselves require only a short time and provide the products in high yield. Key words: magnetic nanoparticle; silica; Knoevenagel condensation; Michael addition; cyclic diketone Homogeneous acid catalysts such as H 2 SO 4 , HF, and H 3 PO 4 are generally used by chemists in industrial catalytic processes [1,2]. Unfortunately, however, the inefficient separation of the catalyst from the final products and the requirement for the neutralization of the acidic waste can impose economic and environmental barriers upon the application of these acid catalysts and limit any activities focused on the broadening of their scope, leading ultimately to restrictions in their wider use in a number of other potential applications. In accordance with the principles of â€œgreen chemistryâ€�, the design of easily sepa- rable, reusable, non-toxic, low cost, and insoluble acidic cata- lysts has become an important area of research in chemistry [3]. In this context, the use of nanoparticles as heterogeneous catalysts has attracted considerable attention because of the interesting structural features and high levels of catalytic ac- tivity associated with these materials [4,5]. Furthermore, nanoparticle materials are considered to be a bridge between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts [6]. Unfortunately, however, nanoparticles are unstable and the recycling of these materials is often tedious because the re- covery of these very small particles requires the use of an expensive ultra-centrifugation technique that has limited their application. To address the issues of recyclability and reusability, con- siderable efforts have been focused on the use of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) because their paramagnetic properties enable the trouble-free separation of the catalyst from the re- action mixture using an external magnet [7]. Unmodified MNPs tend to aggregate into large clusters because of their anisotropic dipolar attraction and this process can have a deleterious effect on the otherwise advantageous properties of the materials [8]. The aggregation associated with MNPs can be avoided by creating an electrostatic double layer [9] using a large amount of surfactants [10], or through the formation of a passive coating of inert material such as a polymer, were the presence of carbon and silica atoms on the surfaces of the iron Firouzeh NEMATI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1825â€“1831 oxide nanoparticles can assist in preventing their aggregation [11]. Furthermore, silanol moieties present on the surface can readily be functionalized via the appropriate surface modifica- tions, enabling the introduction of a variety of different func- tionalities [12]. The Knoevenagel condensation is an important transforma- tion in organic chemistry and holds a position of particular significance in organic synthesis. The reaction is predomi- nately employed for formation of C-C double bonds during the synthesis of ï�¡,ï�¢-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Classically, tetraketones and their enol forms have been synthesized through a combination of the Knoevenagel condensation and Michael addition reactions of aldehydes with 1,3-cyclic dike- tones. These compounds are themselves key intermediates in the preparation of a variety of different heterocyclic com- pounds, including acridine diones [13] and xanthenes, which have been used as dyes, fluorescent materials for the visuali- zation of bio-molecules, and in laser technologies on account of their useful spectroscopic properties [14,15]. Recently, we reported the catalyst-free synthesis of tetraketones under mild conditions in PEG-400 [16]. Unfortunately, the long reaction time required under these conditions represents a major dis- advantage to this methodology. With this in mind, and given the importance and general utility of these compounds, the development of an efficient, general, and environmentally benign method for the preparation of these widely used mate- rials is of prime importance. 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation of catalyst 1.1.1 Preparation of nano-Fe 3 O 4 The MNPs were prepared according to a previously reported procedure [17]. Typically, FeCl 3 Â·6H 2 O (0.02 mol) and FeCl 2 Â·4H 2 O (0.01 mol) were dissolved in distilled water (100 ml) in a three-necked round-bottom flask (250 ml). The re- sulting transparent solution was heated at 90 Â°C with rapid mechanical stirring under N 2 atmosphere for 1 h. A solution of concentrated aqueous ammonia (10 ml, 25 wt%) was then added to the solution in a drop-wise manner over a 30 min period using a dropping funnel. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and the resulting magnetic parti- cles collected with a magnet and rinsed thoroughly with dis- tilled water. 1.1.2 Preparation of nano-Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 Nano-Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 was synthesized according to a previ- ously published literature method [18]. Magnetic nano parti- cles (1.0 g) were initially diluted via the sequential addition of water (20 ml), ethanol (60 ml), and concentrated aqueous ammonia (1.5 ml, 28 wt%). The resulting dispersion was then homogenized by ultrasonic vibration in a water bath. A solution of TEOS (0.45 ml) in ethanol (10 ml) was then added to the dispersion in a drop-wise manner under continuous mechanical stirring. Following a 12 h period of stirring, the resulting product was collected by magnetic separation and washed three times with ethanol. 1.1.3 Preparation of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -SO 3 H Chlorosulfonic acid (0.5 g, 4.5 mmol) was added in a drop-wise manner to a cooled (ice-bath) solution of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 (1 g) in n-hexane (5 ml) over a 2 h period. Upon completion of the addition, the mixture was stirred for a further 3 h until to allow for the complete dissipation of HCl from the reaction vessel. The resulted MNPs were separated using an external magnet and washed with methanol before being dried in an oven at 60 Â°C to give Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -SO 3 H as a brown powder. The number of H + sites (0.32 mmol/g) was determined by acid-base titration. 1.2 Characterization FT-IR measurements were recorded on a Shimadzu 8400s spectrometer with KBr plates. NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker Avance-3 400 MHz instrument at 20â€“25 Â°C. Ele- mental analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer CHN analyzer 2400 series II. Melting points were determined on an Electrothermal 9100 without further corrections. Thermogra- vimetric analyses (TGA) were conducted on a Du Pont 2000 thermal analysis apparatus under a N 2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 Â°C/min. The sizes of MNPs were evaluated using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, 100 kV, Philips-CM 10). To determining the acid loading of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -SO 3 H, a 0.1 mol/L aqueous solution of KOH (2 ml) was added to Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 (0.01 g) in an Erlenmeyer flask, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 15 min. The nanomagnetic catalyst was then recovered with external magnet, and the clear solution was retained for analysis. Two drops of phenolphthalein indicator were then added to the remaining solution and the resulting mixture was titrated to neutrality using a 0.1 mol/L aqueous HCl solution to determine the loading of the acid sites on the Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -SO 3 H nanocatalyst. The H + loading of the nano-catalyst determined in this way was found to be 0.32 mmol/g. 1.3 Catalytic performance test The application of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -SO 3 H catalyst was inves- tigated for the synthesis of tetraketones via a combination of the Knoevenagel condensation and Michael addition reactions of aromatic aldehydes with dimedone, 1,3-indandione, or Firouzeh NEMATI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1825â€“1831 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid in water at room temperature (Scheme 1). In a general procedure for the synthesis of 5,5-dimethyl-2-((4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexyl)(phenyl) methyl) cyclohexane-1,3-dione, a mixture of dimedone (0.28 g, 2 mmol), benzaldehyde (0.21 g, 1 mmol), and Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 - SO 3 H (0.01 g) in H 2 O (6 ml) was stirred for 80 min at room temperature. Upon completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC), the catalyst was separated from the solid crude product using an external magnet. The precipitated solid was then filtered and the filter-cake collected and crystallized from ethanol to afford the pure product. Yield 97%, 0.35 g, m.p. 194â€“195 Â°C. All of the products generated in this way were characterized by comparison of their spectral (IR, 1 H NMR), TLC, and melting point data with those of the authentic samples. Upon completion of the catalytic reactions, the catalyst was separated from the solid crude product using an external magnet. The precipitated solid was then filtered and the filter-cake collected and dissolved in hot EtOH, and any remaining catalyst was removed magnetically. The recovered catalyst was subse- quently washed with acetone and MeOH and dried at 60 Â°C to give recycled Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -SO 3 H. The spectral (IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR) and analytical data for new compounds are as fol- lows. 3-Hydroxy-2-((2-hydroxy-4,4-dimethyl-6-oxocyclohex-1-e nyl)(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)methyl)-5,5-dimethylcyclohex-2-e none. m.p. 183â€“185 Â°C. 1 H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3 ): Î´ 1.14 (s, 6H), 1.26 (s, 3H), 1.29 (s, 3H), 2.50â€“2.33 (m, 8H), 3.79 (s, 3H), 3.85 (s, 3H), 5.53 (s, 1H), 6.66 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 2H), 6.81 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 11.68 (s, br, 1H), 12.01 (s, br, 1H); 13 C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl 3 ): Î´ 28.5, 29.65, 30.28, 50.35, 51.59, 55.21, 56.13, 108.81, 111.32, 114.15, 115.21, 122.40, 135.52, 146.81, 149.87, 180.98, 181.00, 198.94, 199.57; IR (KBr, cm â€“1 ): Î½ 2962, 2839, 1589.

The MNPs were prepared via a chemical co-precipitation [25] and were subsequently coated with a layer of silica using the sol-gel method [26] to provide reaction sites for further functionaliza- tion and thermal stability. The Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 nanoparticles were then transformed to Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -SO 3 H via a condensation reaction with chlorosulfonic acid in n-hexane to afford a dark brown powder with a H + loading of 0.32 mmol/g, as deter- mined by simple titration. The resulting MNP acid catalyst was characterized by FT-IR, particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE), TEM, and TGA. FT-IR analysis was used to characterize the presence of the â€“SO 3 H groups on the surface of the MNPs (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1(3), the FT-IR spectrum of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -SO 3 H was clearly different from those of Fe 3 O 4 (Fig. 1(1)) and Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 (Fig. 1(2)). The broad band at around 3500â€“3000 cm â€“1 was attributed to adsorbed water. The strong absorption at 578 cm â€“1 was characteristic of the Feâ€“O stretching vibration (Fig. 1(1) and 1(2)). For Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -SO 3 H, the Feâ€“O vibra- tion bands were shifted to 586 cm â€“1 because of quantum con- finement (Fig. 1(3)). Bands corresponding to Siâ€“Oâ€“Si stretching appeared at 1072 cm â€“1 , whereas the absorption band at 1419 cm â€“1 (corresponding to asymmetric SO 2 stretching) and the broad peak in range of 1080â€“1211 cm â€“1 (attributed to the overlapping of peaks corresponding to Siâ€“Oâ€“Si, Feâ€“Oâ€“Si, and symmetric SO 2 stretching) indicated that the MNPs possessed SO 3 H groups. The PIXE spectrum of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -SO 3 H indicated the presence of Fe, Si, and S (Fig. 2). The PIXE results were in good agreement with the FT-IR analysis (Table 1). TGA was used to study the thermal stability of the acid catalyst (Fig. 3). The TGA curve was divided into several regions corresponding to different mass lose ranges. The first region, which occurred below 150 Â°C, displayed a mass loss that was attributable to the loss of adsorbed solvent or trapped water from the catalyst. A mass loss of approximately 10% weight occurred between 150 and 500 Â°C that was likely a consequence of the loss of SO 3 H groups. The occurrence of further mass losses at higher temperature resulted from the 4000 3500 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 1 0 7 2 5 7 8 1 4 1 9 1 1 2 1 1 0 8 0 1 1 6 4 1 4 0 4 T r a n s m i t t a n c e Wavenumber (cm ï€­1 ) (1) (2) (3) 1 4 0 4 5 7 8 5 8 6 6 5 5 Fig. 1.

Thus, the catalyst was stable up to 250 Â°C, confirming that it could be safely used in organic reactions at temperatures in the range of 80â€“140 Â°C. TEM analysis revealed that the Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -SO 3 H nanoparticles were uniform in size with an average diameter around 15 nm (Fig. 4). Having synthesized and fully characterized the Fe 3 O 4 @ SiO 2 -SO 3 H, its role as a catalyst was evaluated for the synthesis of tetraketones. We initially investigated a model reaction between dimedone and benzaldehyde in H 2 O. From the results provided in Table 2, it was clear that Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -SO 3 H per- formed well to give the desired product within 80 min in 98% yield at room temperature. For comparison, the model reaction was performed using nano-Fe 3 O 4 and Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 , which gave the desired product in 63% and 54% yield, respectively (Table 2, entries 2 and 3). These results confirmed that Fe 3 O 4 @ SiO 2 -SO 3 H performed more effectively as a catalyst than the original homogeneous catalyst. The greater catalytic activity of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -SO 3 H was most likely related to the SO 3 H groups of the catalyst, which could provide efficient acidic sites. Furthermore, this catalyst performed more efficiently than silica sulfuric acid (SSA) with respect to the yield and time of the model reaction under the same conditions, with the dif- ference here being attributed to the larger surface area offered by the nanoscale heterogeneous catalyst (Table 2, entry 5). The model reaction was also investigated in several other solvent to further investigate the efficiency of the catalyst (Table 2, entries 4 and 8â€“11). Based on reaction yield alone, the best transformation was observed when the reaction was per- formed in H 2 O, indicating that the solvent polarity could play an important role in the process. The reaction was also inves- tigated with different catalyst loading, revealing that 10 mg (10 mol%) of catalyst provided the best results in terms of reaction time, economy of catalyst charge, and reaction yield (Table 2, entries 4, 6, and 7). In a control experiment, the reaction was performed without the catalyst and only a trace amount of the product was observed, confirming that the Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -SO 3 H material was performing as a catalyst in the transformation. To evaluate the scope and limitations of this methodology, we extended our studies to include a variety of structurally different arylaldehydes and initially examined the reaction of dimedone with several different aldehydes. The results are summarized in Table 3 (Table 3, entries 1â€“18). In almost all cases, the reactions proceeded smoothly within 65â€“170 min, providing the corresponding products in excellent isolated yields. It is noteworthy that the use of bulky aldehydes such as naphthalene 2-carbaldehyde, afforded the corresponding product in high yield without the formation of any side prod- ucts (Table 3, entry 15). In contrast, the use of an aliphatic aldehyde gave the corresponding compound in a lower yield (Table 3, entry 18). Encouraged by these results, we also attempted to prepare tetraketone derivatives from other 1,3-cyclic diketones to fur- ther broaden the scope of our novel catalytic transformation. Pleasingly, the reaction of a variety of different arylaldehydes with 2 equivalents of 1,3-indanedione (Table 3, entries 19â€“25) or 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid (Table 3, entries 26â€“28) resulted in the formation of the corresponding desired products in high 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 75 80 85 90 95 100 Temperature ( o C) M a s s ( % ) Fig. 3.

Interestingly, benzaldehydes bearing strong electron donating groups only produced the Knoevenagel condensation products with 1,3-indanedione [16] and 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid (Table 3, entries 23 and 28, Scheme 2). From a green chemistry perspective, experiments concern- ing the recycling and reuse of the catalyst were carried out. Upon completion of the reaction, the catalyst was simply re- covered with an external magnet, washed with methanol, and dried at 60 Â°C for 1 h. The recovered catalyst was then added to a fresh reaction mixture under the same conditions. The cata- lyst could be efficiently recovered and recycled up to three times without suffering any significant drop in its catalytic activity or the yield for the reaction (Table 4). Unfortunately, however, further recycling of the nanocatalyst led to significant losses in its activity, with these losses being linked to the gradual loss of the catalyst during the filtration and washing stages.

Tel: +98-231-3366171, Fax: +98-231-3354057 Sulfonic acid-functionalized silica-coated nano-Fe3O4 particles (Fe3O4@SiO2-SO3H) have been prepared as a novel heterogeneous acid using a facile process. The material was subsequently identified as an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of a variety of tetraketone derivatives via the Knoevenagel condensation and Michael addition reactions of aromatic aldehydes to dimedone, 1,3-indanedione, and 1,3-dimethyl barbituric acid. The catalyst could be readily recovered using a simple external magnet and reused several times without any significant loss in activity. The current catalytic process is both sustainable and economical because it operates under aqueous conditions, the catalyst can be recovered and reused, and the reactions themselves require only a short time and provide the products in high yield. Graphical abstract Sulfonic acid-functionalized silica-coated nano-Fe3O4 particles have been prepared under mild and simple reaction conditions. The resulting nanomagnetic heterogeneous solid acid exhibited good catalytic activity in the synthesis of a series of tetraketone derivatives under aqueous conditions.
