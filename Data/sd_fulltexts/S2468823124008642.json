CeO2-based catalysts have attracted widespread attention in gasoline vehicle exhaust purification, and their catalytic performance is often intimately associated with the supports used. In this work, a series CeO2-ZrO2 (CZ) supports with varying composition and phase structure (with or without partial κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure) have been employed for Pd-only three-way catalysts (TWCs), and the corresponding activities were evaluated. It was found that for catalysts without κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, the activity is positively related with the content of CeO2 in CZ due to the increased Pd-O-Ce interfaces. However, as the formation of κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure is accompanied by the increased surface oxygen vacancies but decreased surface Ce-Ox species, for catalysts with κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, there exists a balance between the reasonable concentration of oxygen vacancies and surface Ce-Ox species in determining the corresponding activities. Among these catalysts, only the Pd-only TWC with medium content of CeO2 and partial κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure (Pd/κMC) exhibits superior activity than that in the same composition but without κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure (Pd/MC). This may be associated with the obviously increased surface oxygen vacancies introduced in κMC, which could compensate the slight decrease of its surface Ce-Ox species to stabilize the supported Pd species in smaller size and higher oxidation states. This finding enhances the understanding of support effects to rationally design efficient heterogeneous catalysts.

CeO2-ZrO2-based material (CZ) is one of the most widely used supports in three-way catalysts (TWCs) due to its unique redox properties, which could compensate the air-to-fuel (A/F) oscillation in the exhaust gas and thus improve the catalytic efficiency of CO, NOx and HC simultaneously [4,5]. In addition, the surface oxygen vacancies over CZ are recognized as anchor sites for noble metals, especially Pd, generally through Pd-O-Ce bonds to improve the thermal stability of the TWCs [1,6]. With the gradually stringent regulations, to pursuit TWCs with extraordinarily thermal stability is highly desired. In this respect, CZ rich in surface oxygen vacancies is urgently needed to stabilize the supported nanoparticles during the high temperature exposure and long-time operation. To fabricate defective CZ supports, kinds of surface defect enrichment strategies have been put forward, among which regulating the phase structures of CZ have been recognized as one of the most effective methods [7,8]. Depending on different composition, preparation methods and thermal conditions, there are generally multiple phase structures for CZ, including cubic fluorite, pseudo cubic, tetragonal, monoclinic, pyrochlore and κappa phase [9–11]. Among them, 1/8 of the oxygen anions in CZ with κappa phase (donated as κ-Ce2Zr2O8) can be readily removed with an oxygen vacancy formation energy of 0.72 eV, which is much lower than that with common cubic fluorite and tetragonal phases. Meanwhile, the κ-Ce2Zr2O8 exhibits an extraordinarily high cerium efficiency of 89 % than random structures (<52 %) [12–15]. Deng [15] et al. investigated the effect of κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure on the TWCs, they found that the κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure produced more active species (Pdδ+, δ ≥ 3), and was able to anchor Pd well through Pd-O-Ce bonds, which greatly improved the catalytic activity. Zhang [16] et al. revealed that the κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure can broaden the λ window for Pd-based TWCs, they attributed this to the excellent redox capacity of the κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure itself, which altered the interactions between Pd and the supports, thus improved the dynamic oxygen storage capacity (DOSC) of the Pd-based catalysts. Zhan [17] et al. found that the κ-CZ had higher CH4 catalytic activity and durability compared with t-CZ and suggested that the κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure enhanced the interaction between the Pd and CeO2 supports, resulting in better dispersion of smaller PdOx particles and higher oxygen mobility, which improved the catalytic activity of hydrocarbon. As a result, κ-Ce2Zr2O8 exhibits a great potential application in TWCs. Both Toyota [18] and Ford [7] have confirmed that the addition of κ-Ce2Zr2O8 to Rh-based TWCs could not only compensate the A/F oscillation, but also improve the NOx conversion efficiency even the content of Rh has been obviously decrease. However, inconsistent conclusions about the roles of κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure formed in CZ with different Ce/Zr ratio for Pd-based TWCs have been drawn. For example, Deng et al. [15], Zhan et al. [19] and Zhang et al. [16] reported that the presence of κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure in CZ (nCe/nZr=1/2 or 1/1) and Ce0.43Zr0.57O2-Al2O3 (nCe/nZr=0.75:1) benefits to enhance the interaction between support and Pd species, resulting in higher Pd valence and better dispersion of PdOx particles, thus increase the catalytic activity of Pd-based catalysts. However, Jason wu[7] concluded that the κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure in CZ (nCe/nZr=1/1) significantly reduced the catalytic activity of Pd-based TWCs. According to the literatures [20,21], the cation migration or rearrangement is inevitable during the formation of κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, which needs a redox treatment composed of severe reduction (SR) (TSR > 1173 K) with mild re-oxidation (MO) (TMO ≤ 873 K). And resultantly, a Zr-rich surface has been detected in CZ even a partial κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure has been formed [22,23]. That is to say, when submitting CZ with κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure as support to Pd-based TWCs, two opposites interactions may encounter. On the one hand, as the interaction between Pd-CeO2 is stronger than Pd-ZrO2, the application of CZ with Zr-rich surface will weaken the interaction between Pd and support due to the decreased Pd-Ce interfaces. On the other hand, the more oxygen vacancies generated by the appearance of κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure may contribute to strength Pd-support interactions, thus promote the dispersion and stabilization of Pd particles. In this regard, it seems reasonable that the κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure in CZ with adjustable Ce/Zr ratio may play distinct roles in determining the activity of Pd-based TWCs, the underline mechanism of which needs to be further systematically investigated on the basis of identical evaluation conditions for efficient support design. In this work, a series of CZ with different Ce/Zr ratio have been prepared and submitted to different thermal treatment to achieve different phase structures (with or without κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure). Then the effects of κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure in CZ with different Ce/Zr ratio on Pd-support interaction and catalytic activity have been systematically investigated. This work deepens the understanding of metal-support interaction and gives a new sight in the efficient utilization of noble metals for design and synthesis of highly stable and active TWCs. 2 Experimental sections 2.1 Preparation of support materials and Pd-only TWCs CeO2-ZrO2-Y2O3-La2O3 (CZ) with three different compositions have been prepared by coprecipitation method. Specifically, the compositions of the three materials are 30–60–5–5 wt.%, 45–45–5–5 wt.%, 60–30–5–5 wt.% respectively, and we named them LC, MC and HC according to their CeO2 content (while ‘L’, ‘M’, and ‘H’ stand for ‘Low’, ‘Medium’, and ‘High’, respectively). Typically, mixed salt solutions (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, ZrOCO3, Y(NO3)3·6H2O, and La(NO3)3·6H2O) are precipitated from a mixed alkaline solution of (NH4)2CO3 and NH3·H2O at 60 °C and pH = 9. Subsequently, it was stirred for 48 h and the precipitate was filtered out by suction filtration and dried to obtain the initial material. The dried precipitated powder was taken and calcined at 600 °C in air atmosphere for 3 h to obtain XCZ, where X stands for ‘L’, ‘M’, and ‘H’, respectively. Then the XCZ was divided into two parts which will be submitted to different atmosphere as shown in Fig. 1 . One part of CZ was oxidized in an 5 % O2/Ar atmosphere at 1000 °C for 1 h to obtain XC, where X stands for ‘L’, ‘M’, and ‘H’, respectively. The another was reduced in an 5 % H2/N2 atmosphere at 1000 °C for 1 h and re-oxidized in air atmosphere at 550 °C for 1 h to form partial κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, which was donated as κXC (X = L, M and H). The samples that after only high-temperature reduction were designated LC-P, MC-P and HC-P. Then the Pd-only TWCs with 1.0 wt.% Pd were prepared by the wetness impregnation using XC and κXC as supports and Pd(NO3)2 as precursor. The detailed preparation process for the monolith catalyst is consistent with our previous work [15]. The impregnated samples were dried at 120 °C for 2 h and calcined at 550 °C for 3 h Subsequently the catalyst powder was mixed with water and ball-milled into a slurry, and then the slurry was coated onto a cordierite honeycomb substrate (Corning, USA, 400 mesh, 2.5 cm3), the coating volume is 140 g/L. After drying, the catalyst was calcined at 550 °C for 3 h to obtain the initial monolithic catalysts. The catalysts followed by further calcination at 900 °C in air for 4 h to obtain final catalysts, labeled as Pd/LC, Pd/MC, Pd/HC, Pd/κLC, Pd/κMC, Pd/κHC, respectively. 2.2 Evaluation of the activity of Pd-only TWCs The three-way catalytic activity evaluation of the catalysts was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor equipped with multiple air channels. The simulated gasoline vehicle exhaust consists of C3H6 (220 ppm), C3H8 (110 ppm), CO (4600 ppm), H2 (1533 ppm), NO (1250 ppm), CO2 (11 %), H2O (10 %), O2 (3600 ppm), and N2 (the balance gas), its air-fuel ratio λ is controlled around 1. During the test, the gas flow rate was regulated using a mass flow meter and the gas hour space velocity (GHSV) was controlled at 50,000 h-1. Prior to measurement, the catalyst was activated at 550 °C for 1 h under reaction conditions, and then the temperature was increased from 100 °C to 400 °C at an elevated rate of 5 °C min-1, and the gas concentration was recorded at 5 °C intervals during the process. The concentrations of C3H8, C3H6, CO and NO after the reaction were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Antaris IGS-6700, Nicolet, Thermo Fisher Scientific). λ = 2 [ O 2 ] + [ N O ] [ C O ] + [ H 2 ] + 9 [ C 3 H 6 ] + 10 [ C 3 H 8 ] 2.3 Characterization of materials and catalysts The D/Max-2500 X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) was used to characterize the structure of the samples and XRD spectra were obtained. The X-ray source was Cu Kα rays (λ = 0.15406 nm). The test voltage and current were 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively, and the 2θ range was 10–90° with a step size of 0.02° The LabRAM HR Laser Raman spectrometer (HORIBA JOBIN YVON, France) was used to collect Raman spectra, with an excitation light wavelength of 532 nm, an output laser energy of 73.5 mW at room temperature, and a detection range of 50–2000 cm-1. The reducing properties of the samples were analyzed using Hydrogen-Temperature Programmed Reduction (H2-TPR). The test was performed on a laboratory self-assembly unit equipped with a GC-9790 gas chromatograph (Fuli, China). Prior to testing, the samples were first pretreated in an atmosphere of N2 (25 mL min-1) at 450 °C for 40 min and then cooled to room temperature. The atmosphere was then converted to a 5 % H2/N2 mixture (30 mL min-1), and the sample was heated from room temperature to 900 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C min-1. The consumption of H2 was simultaneously detected by a thermal conductivity cell detector (TCD). And last, CuO was used as a reference standard, so that can calculate the H2 consumption. The in-situ CH3OH adsorption Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (CH3OH-DRIFT) was acquired on a Thermo Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, USA), which has an MCT detector and is equipped with a high temperature reaction cell. The procedure was as follows: the sample was first warmed from room temperature to 450 °C in purity N2 (30 mL min-1) and held for 30 min, then the sample was purged and cooled down to 25 °C in N2 gas to collect background spectra. The sample was purged with CH3OH/N2 (16 %, 30 mL min-1) at 25 °C for 30 min, then the gas was switched to N2 (40 mL min-1) for 15 min and the spectrum was collected. The textural properties, including the specific surface area, pore volume and average pore size were tested by N2-absorption and desorption with a Quantachrome Autosorb automatic instrument. The samples were first placed in a vacuum environment, then outgassed at 300 °C for 3 h, subsequently tested at −196 °C with liquid nitrogen. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the distribution of elements on the surface of the samples and the chemical state of the relevant elements. The instrument was a XSAM-800 electron spectrometer (Kratos, UK). Measurements were performed at 13 kV and 20 mA using Al Kα radiation. Surface charge effects were calibrated by an internal standard method. The method uses C 1 s (284.6 eV) as an internal standard to calibrate the binding energy. The in-situ CO-DRIFT acquisition procedure was the same as CH3OH-DRIFT, but with the adsorption gas is 1 % CO/He (30 mL min-1). The procedure was as follows: the sample was first warmed from room temperature to 450 °C in 5 % H2/N2 gas (40 mL min-1) and held for 30 min, then the gas was switched to He (40 mL min-1), and the sample was purged and cooled down to 25 °C in purity He to collect background spectra. The sample was purged with 1 % CO/He (30 mL min-1) at 25 °C for 30 min, then the gas was switched to He (40 mL min-1) for 15 min and the spectrum was collected. The dispersion of Pd was tested using a CO pulse adsorption reaction device. Prior to testing, the samples were reduced in an atmosphere of pure H2 (30 mL min-1) at 450 °C for 1 h After cooling to room temperature, the U-tubes were placed in ethanol-dry ice (−78 °C) to avoid the adsorption of CO by Ce elements in the materials. The samples were then cooled to −78 °C in a stream of He gas (40 mL min-1), and a fixed amount of CO was injected into the samples every 2 min until no CO depletion was detected. The dispersion of Pd was calculated by linear adsorption on the total CO uptake assuming CO: Pd = 1:1 [24,25]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Properties of the supports In order to investigate the phase structure of the series materials, XRD and Raman have been characterized. As shown in Fig. 2 (a) and Fig. S1, we can clearly see that all samples showed the peaks of CZ solid solutions, but the main peak of CZ is gradually shifted to the low-angle direction as the Ce content increased, indicating that the compounds with different Ce/Zr ratio compositions are formed. They are indexed as Ce0.16Zr0.84O2 (JCPDS PDF38–1437) for LC and κLC, Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 (JCPDS PDF38–1436) for MC and κMC, Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 (JCPDS PDF38–1439) for HC and κHC, respectively. However, the characteristic peak referring to κ-Ce2Zr2O8 at 2θ ≈ 14° [22,26] is absent in κLC, κMC and κHC, which may attribute to its small amount that is under the limit of detection of XRD. But the physical phase of pyrochlore was detected in all three samples that reduced at high temperature as shown in Fig. S2, indicating that the κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure was present in our catalysts. Therefore, Raman spectroscopy, which is more sensitive, has been further used to probe the phase structure of the materials in Fig. 2(b). Obviously, there are two sharp peaks at about 472 cm-1 and 601 cm-1 in all CZ materials, which could be referred as the vibration of Ce-O-Ce bond and the defective structure with oxygen vacancies [27]. In addition, three newly emerged peaks at about 270 cm-1, 450 cm-1 and 484 cm-1 are detected in κLC, κMC and κHC with respect to LC, MC and HC, which were associated with the κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure as Monitini [28] and Yin [22] et al. reported. As a result, it could be concluded that the CZ solid solution with partial κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure have been successfully prepared. In addition, as shown in Fig. 2(b), the intensity of peaks associated with oxygen vacancies over CZ with κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure (κLC, κMC and κHC) is much higher than those without (LC, MC and HC). Then to evaluate the content of oxygen vacancies and κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, the values of Iov / I F2 g and Iκ/ I F2 g have been calculated in Fig. 2(c). As shown in Fig. 2(c) and Fig. S3, a 7 or 34 times increase of the vale of Iov / I F2 g , referring to the increased content of oxygen vacancies, has been detected in κLC and κMC with respect to LC and MC, respectively. Similarly, a 2.9 times increase of the content of oxygen vacancies has even been manifested in κHC comparing with HC. Meanwhile, the values of Iκ/ I F2 g presented in Fig. 2(c), referring to the content of κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, decrease by the order of κMC (3.87) > κLC (0.59) > κHC (0.41), indicating that the formation of κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure is more favorable in CZ with nCe/nZr=1/1. In addition, as the reduction of CZ is initiated by oxygen vacancies, the H2-TPR test have also been performed to evaluate the mobility of oxygen species in Fig. 2(d). Obviously, an asymmetric peak at about 600 °C has been detected in all the CZ materials, indicating the simultaneously reduction of oxygen species at surface, subsurface and in the bulk [29]. While it should be noted that much sharper peak intensities have been detected in CZ with partial κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure than those without, suggesting that the presence of the κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure accelerated the mobility of the bulk-phase oxygen. Then the Ce efficiency (Ce efficiency = experimentally obtained hydrogen consumption/theoretical hydrogen consumption) calculated by H2-TPR has been displayed in Fig. 2(d), it was found that the Ce efficiency of the samples with partial κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure were all significantly greater than those without, in detail, 58.68 % for κLC and 32.63 % for LC, 37.14 % for κMC and 15.98 % for MC, 28.42 % for κHC and 8.98 % for HC. That is, the presence of partial κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure can significantly increase the redox capacity and oxygen vacancy concentration of the CZ. This is consistent with the literature that the κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure has a low oxygen vacancy generation energy compared to the tetragonal/cubic structure [13]. According to our previous conclusion [15], the formation of κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure is accompanied by the atom migration and rearrangement, which would strongly affect the surface element distribution over CZ. As a result, the top-surface elemental composition of the materials has been characterized by CH3OH-DRIFT in Fig. 2(e). As shown in Fig. 2(e) and Fig. S4, all samples present four peaks in the range of 1200 to 1000 cm-1. The vibrational peaks at 1157 cm-1 and 1103 cm-1 can be attributed to CH3OH adsorbed on Zr4+ and Ce4+, respectively [22,28]. The peak at 1070 cm-1 belongs to v(OC)s on Ce or Zr in different environments (Ce4+-Ce4+ or Zr4+-Zr4+ or Ce4+-Zr4+), and that at 1030 cm-1 belongs to the triple-bridged adsorbed CH3OH [28,30]. It has been reported that the intensity of the vibrational peak of CH3OH adsorbed on Zr4+ is positively correlated with the content of Zr in the complex oxide [31,32]. Accordingly, the relative intensity of the Zr4+–OCH3 peak with respect to the Ce4+–OCH3 peak (IZr /ICe ) can be used to assess the relative content of Ce and Zr on the sample surface, and the results are listed in Fig. 2(f). Clearly, for CZ without κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, the value of IZr/ICe is in line of HC<MC<LC, indicating that the surface content of Ce increased with the Ce/Zr ratio of the material itself, which is in accordance with the experimental design. However, for CZ with κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, a much higher value of IZr/ICe , referring to a Zr-rich surface, is exhibited with respect to its counterpart with the same composition due to the rearrangement of surface Ce4+ and Zr4+ during the redox treatment. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2(f), much obvious increase of IZr/ICe value in κLC (1.062) and κHC (0.023) has been detected, which is almost 1.43 and 0.77 times larger than that of LC (0.437) and HC (0.013), respectively. On contrary, κMC (0.355) exhibits the similar value of IZr/ICe with MC (0.332), namely, only a slight increase of 7 %. Then it could be concluded that comparing with κLC and κHC, obvious increased oxygen vacancies could be obtained in κMC without significantly affecting the distribution of surface elements with respect to MC. 3.2 Activity of the Pd-only TWCs To investigate the effects of κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure and the composition of CZ support on the activity, the results of three-way catalytic performance of Pd-only catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 , and the corresponding T 50 (temperature for 50 % conversion) and T 90 (temperature for 90 % conversion) of different pollutants are listed in Table 1 . As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1, for CZ without κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, the activity of Pd-only TWCs decreases in the order of Pd/HC > Pd/MC > Pd/LC with gradually increased T 50 and T 90, the results of which is consistent with the content of CeO2 in the composition of supports. However, for CZ with partial κ-Ce2Zr2O8, it is worth noting that the catalytic activity of Pd-only TWCs did not increase with the increase of CeO2 content, but showed the order of Pd/κMC > Pd/κHC> Pd/κLC. Moreover, it is interesting that not all CZ materials with κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, namely with more oxygen vacancies, can improve the catalytic activity of Pd-only TWCs. In detail, Pd/κLC exhibits similar activity with Pd/LC, the T 50 differences of CO, NO, C3H8, C3H6 between Pd/κLC and Pd/LC is below 10 °C. While Pd/HC exhibits much superior activity than Pd/κHC, the T 50 of CO, NO, C3H8 and C3H6 over the former catalyst is 40 °C, 20 °C, 16 °C, 26 °C lower than that over the last. Differently, Pd/κMC displays much higher activity with the T 50 of CO, NO, C3H8 and C3H6 is 222 °C, 290 °C, 325 °C and 242 °C, respectively, among which the T 50 of CO and C3H6 is 46 °C and 26 °C lower than Pd/MC. As the activity of Pd-only TWCs is closely related with the states of supported Pd species, it is reasonable to infer that the states of Pd species have been greatly altered by the phase structure and composition of CZ supports, which needs to be further studied. Additionally, we can observe that the NO reduction reaction is stagnant in the mid-temperature range at about 270∼320 °C, which is common in TWC. As Takashi Toyao et al. [33,34] reported that catalytic conversion of NO by CO in the NOCO reaction, which is a major denitrification reaction in the TWC and they found that the temperature at which the conversion of NO stalls corresponds exactly to the temperature at which CO is fully oxidized. This phenomenon was also found by Liang[35] et al. and was attributed to a decrease in NOx conversion due to the reduction of reductant when CO is almost depleted. Therefore, we believe that the rapid reaction of NO in the low-temperature is due to the presence of CO, and the temperature at which CO is fully oxidized (260∼300 °C) just corresponds to the slow conversion of NO in the medium-temperature. A significant amount of literature has reported about the reaction mechanisms of pollutants in automobile exhaust. For the CO oxidation, it is widely believed that the primary reaction mechanism is the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L-H) and Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) models [36–38]. For CO oxidation on such reducible supports, they generally follow the MvK mechanism, so in our work the CO reacts with the lattice oxygen in CeO2, and subsequently gas-phase oxygen diffuses into CeO2 and fills these oxygen vacancies [36,39]. Our previous work has investigated the reaction mechanism of C3H8+NO [40]. In situ DRIFTS showed that NO was first adsorbed on the catalyst surface in the form of monodentate nitrate/nitrite, and the vibrational peaks of monodentate nitrate/nitrite gradually disappeared with the addition of C3H8. In our work, the oxidation state of Pd (PdO2) is the active center, which first transforms to PdOOH, then, NO adsorbs onto PdOOH and is oxidized to *NO2 by O. Finally, the *NO2 reacts with C3H8 (or an intermediate of C3H8) to form the CO2 and N2. Moreover, the T90 values of NO and C3H8 in the TWC were roughly the same, which indicated that NO had a high reactivity with C3H8. 3.3 Characterization of the Pd-only TWCs In order to analyze the states of the supported Pd species, the CO-DRIFT, CO-chemisorption and XPS spectra have been characterized and displayed. From the CO-DRIFT in Fig. 4 (a), it can be found that there are three peaks in all Pd-only TWCs, among which the first peak located in high frequencies (HF) area that near 2055 cm-1 belongs to CO linearly-bonded CO-Pd, while those at low frequencies (LF) of 1895 cm-1 and 1830 cm-1 are ascribed to bridge-bonded CO-(Pd)2 and three-fold hollow CO-(Pd)3, respectively [41,42]. Moreover, the HF/LF peak intensity ratio can indicate the dispersion of Pd particles, and the larger the value, the better dispersion of Pd. As displayed in Table 2 , for catalysts without κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, the value of HF/LF, referring to the dispersion of the supported Pd particles, decreases in the order of Pd/HC (0.27) > Pd/MC (0.19) > Pd/LC (0.13), the trend of which is similar with the results of D Pd derived from CO-chemisorption, namely Pd/HC (25.1 %) > Pd/MC (14.0 %) > Pd/LC (12.3 %). Then it could be concluded that the higher content of CeO2 in CZ support is more favorable to promote the dispersion of Pd species, which may be associated with abundant Pd-O-Ce interfaces as anchor sites [43]. As a result, smaller particles size of Pd could be detected in the row of Pd/HC (4.8 nm) < Pd/MC (8.0 nm) < Pd/LC (9.1 nm). Differently, for CZ containing κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, the order of HF/LF value and D Pd of the supported Pd particles is Pd/κMC (0.22, 17.0 %) > Pd/κHC (0.15, 16.1 %) > Pd/κLC (0.12, 10.9 %), which is opposite with that of particles size in Pd/κMC (6.6 nm) < Pd/κHC (7.0 nm) < Pd/κLC (10.3 nm). In addition, when comparing the CZ supports with or without κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure in the same composition, distinct findings have been detected. That is, the D Pd is higher in Pd/HC and Pd/LC with respect to Pd/κHC and Pd/κLC, respectively, while Pd/κMC exhibits larger value of D Pd than Pd/MC, which is also consistent with the results of the activity of the Pd-only TWCs. Moreover, the Pd 3d XPS spectra has also been employed to further analyze the electronic states of the surface Pd species in Fig. 4(b), (c) and Table 2. As shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c), all Pd-only TWCs exhibit similar Pd 3d spectra, which could be fitted into peaks with oxidized Pd species and Pd0. In detail, the peak at 337.1–337.9 eV is associated with the oxidized Pdδ+ 3d 5/2 states, and that at 335.2–335.9 eV referring to Pd0 3d 5/2 [15]. Comparatively, Pd/HC exhibits the highest value of Pdδ+/Pd and the relative content of Pd (55.6 %, 0.76 %), followed by Pd/MC (45.7 %, 0.56 %) and Pd/LC (36.9 %, 0.32 %) for catalysts without κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure. For catalysts with κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, the value of Pdδ+/Pd and the relative content of Pd decrease in a row of Pd/κMC (51.8 %, 0.70 %)> Pd/κHC (42.5 %, 0.68 %)> Pd/κLC(33.3 %, 0.33 %). Consistently with the D Pd, the Pdδ+/Pd is higher in Pd/HC and Pd/LC with respect to Pd/κHC and Pd/κLC, respectively, while Pd/κMC exhibits larger value of Pdδ+/Pd than Pd/MC. As the states of Pd particles are closely related with the support, it is reasonable to speculate that different metal-support interaction may exist between Pd/CZ with or without κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure. According to the split-peak fitting results (Fig. 4b-c), the binding energies (B.E.) of Pdδ+ 3d 5/2 decreased in the order of Pd/HC (337.9 eV) > Pd/κMC (337.6 eV) = Pd/MC (337.6 eV) > Pd/κHC (337.4 eV) > Pd/LC (337.3 eV) > Pd/κLC (337.1 eV). According to the literature [31], the shift of B.E. to high value position can be explained by the electron transfer between the Pd species and Ce4+, which can describe the metal-support interaction to some extent. For catalysts without κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, it could be concluded that the electron transfer effect between Pd-supports is enhanced with the increase of CeO2 content in CZ, and thus there is the strongest metal-support interaction in Pd/HC. On contrary, for catalysts containing partial κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, Pd/κMC presented the highest value of B. E for Pdδ+ 3d 5/2 spectra, namely the strongest metal-support interaction, which promoted more Pd species in higher oxidation state with improved dispersion. Moreover, it should be noted that the B. E. of Pdδ+ 3d 5/2 decreased in both Pd/κHC and Pd/κLC with respect to Pd/HC and Pd/LC, respectively, indicating the weakened electron transfer interaction between Pd and Ce4+. On contrary, Pd/κMC and Pd/MC exhibit almost the identical values of B. E. for Pdδ+ 3d 5/2, indicating the interaction between Pd and support haven't been obviously changed. Our previous study [22] showed that the generation of oxygen vacancies in κCZ was located at the position connected to Zr4+. After the reduction treatment, the content of oxygen vacancies in the supports was significantly increased, and therefore it may have affected the XPS spectra of Zr. Therefore, we used not only XPS but also CO-DRIFTS to further investigate the chemical state of Pd species as shown in Fig. S5. According to the literature [44], the peak near 2173 cm-1 are attributed to PdO2 species, which at 2094 cm-1 is assigned to PdO species, while the peak near 1975 cm-1 at lower wave numbers is small partially-oxidized Pd clusters. We can clearly see that Pd species in Pd/κLC are in a higher oxidation state compared to Pd/LC. Meanwhile, the Pd/κMC shows stronger peaks of PdO2 and PdO, indicating that κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure is favorable for possesses more highly oxidized Pd species. Whereas no peak of PdO2 were detected in the Pd/κHC and Pd/HC, by comparing the peak intensities, it was found that Pd/HC contained more PdO species. Thus, the κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure may only be promoted in CZ supports which with a medium content of Ce. As a result, except for Pd/κMC, no obvious improvement or even some deteriorations of activity have been detected in Pd/κHC and Pd/κLC with respect to Pd/HC and Pd/LC, respectively. Then it could be concluded that only when κMC was used as support, the containing κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure benefits to promote the Pd particles in higher dispersion and oxidation states, which in turn improves the activity of Pd/κMC than Pd/MC. Special attention should be paid to that comparing with Pd/MC, more obvious improvement of CO and C3H6 oxidation is presented over Pd/κMC as discussed in Fig. 3 and Table 1, which may associate with its enhanced oxygen activation/transferring ability due to the increased oxygen vacancies of κMC. Then to study the oxygen activation/transferring ability for Pd/κMC and Pd/MC, the OSC, H2-TPR and O2-TPD have been characterized and the results have been displayed in Fig. 5 . As show in Fig. 5(a), it can be clearly seen that Pd/κMC shows higher OSC values of 602 μmol O2/g than Pd/MC with 446 μmol O2/g, which indicates that Pd/κMC may show a much better oxygen activation/transferring ability than Pd/MC. Fig. 5(b) and Fig. S6 show the H2-TPR results of these catalysts. It can be seen that both samples show two peaks at 0–200 °C, which are located at 75–85 °C, and 100–120 °C, respectively. The positive reduction peak can be attributed to co-reduction of PdO and partial CeO2 due to the H-spillover effect [45–47]. Pd/κMC has a lower reduction peak temperature than Pd/MC, indicating better oxygen mobility in Pd/κMC. It is worth noting the appearance of a decomposition peak at around 80 °C, which is the decomposition peak of the PdHx species [48,49], and its occurrence is often associated with larger PdO particle. Then the slighter PdHx decomposition peak of Pd/κMC than Pd/MC suggests that the Pd particles loaded on κMC possessed a smaller particle size, which is consistent with the results obtained from CO adsorption. In Fig. S6, the reduced peaks (α) located around 0 °C is attributed to the reduction of the isolated PdOx, the second reduction peak (β) is attributed to co-reduction of PdO and partial CeO2, and the last inverted peak represents the decomposition of PdHx. The reduction curves for Pd/LC and Pd/κLC were very similar, including the same peak positions and intensities. The only difference is that the β-peak of Pd/κLC was shifted a little towards lower temperature (<10 °C), suggesting that the presence of the κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure has little effect on the oxygen activation/transferring ability of supports that have lower content of Ce. As a result, these two samples showed very similar activities. Although the temperature of the β reduction peak of Pd/κHC was 20 °C lower, its intensity was significantly reduced, suggesting that the κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure promotes the formation of some highly reactive oxygen species, but due to the strong change of surface elements as shown in the CH3OH-DRIFTS results, the migration of the large number of Zr4+ to the surface weakened the interactions between the Pd and supports. Therefore, for the HC sample, the κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure did not serve to promote its activity, but rather reduced it. Moreover, the O2-TPD measurements were further carried out to investigate the capability of the catalysts to activate oxygen and the results have been displayed in Fig. 5(c). Two samples showed three peaks in the tested temperature range. The peaks below 100 °C can be ascribed to the desorption of oxygen species that are physically adsorbed to the catalyst surface. The peak at around 150∼200 °C is related to the desorption of oxygen chemically adsorbed on oxygen vacancies. The other peaks appear at above 550 °C results from the release of surface lattice oxygen and bulk lattice oxygen [50–53]. The intensity of the first peak of Pd/κMC is lower than that of Pd/MC, which is attributed to the smaller specific surface area of Pd/κMC as shown in Table S1, therefore fewer oxygen species were physically adsorbed to the surface. Because the second peak tends to be related to oxygen vacancies and oxygen transport ability, which is an important factor influencing the activity of TWCs, we calculated the integrated area of the peaks and found that the peak area of I 190 in Pd/κMC was almost 1.47 times than the I 155 of Pd/MC, this suggests that Pd/κMC contains more oxygen defects. Therefore, with the above characterizations, it has been clearly recognized that Pd/κMC contains more oxygen-deficient sites and its activation/transferring ability is stronger, so it shows better activity in TWC especially for CO and C3H6 oxidation. 3.4 A short discussion Combined with the results discussed above, a correlation among the properties of support, the states of Pd and the activity of Pd-only TWCs has been concluded in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 6(a), for Pd-only TWCs supported on CZ without κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, with the increase of CeO2 content in the composition of support, the D Pd and Pdδ+/Pd ratio gradually increase, possibly associating with the more Pd-O-Ce interfaces. As a result, Pd/HC exhibits the best activity even though HC exhibits the lowest content of oxygen vacancies within the three CZ supports. That is to say, the activity of Pd-only TWCs supported on CZ without κ-Ce2Zr2O8 is preferentially determined by the surface element distribution, namely the content of Ce-Ox rather than surface oxygen vacancies. Inconsistently, as shown in Fig. 6(b), for Pd-only TWCs supported on CZ with κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, there exists a balance between the reasonable concentration of oxygen vacancies and surface Ce-Ox species since Pd/κMC exhibits the best activity on the basis that κMC displays the medium content of Ce-Ox species and the highest concentration of oxygen vacancies. As reported, the surface oxygen vacancies can serve as anchoring and stabilizing sites for metal nanoparticles. In detail, Pd2+ in Pd(NO3)2 aqueous solution would preferentially interact with surface oxygen vacancies with electron-rich property through the strong electrostatic attraction. And during the calcination process, the decomposition of Pd(NO3)2 precursor and the refilling of oxygen vacancies by O will stabilize Pd in high oxidized state and smaller size with Pd-O-Ce linkages. Then combining with the discussion in Section 3.1, a possible explanation has been concluded for the superior activity of Pd/κMC than Pd/MC. The κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure [13] is a type of cubic structure that contains 96 atoms in one cell, including 16 Ce4+, 16 Zr4+, and 64 O2-, which means that the ratio of Zr to Ce in the κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure is 1 to 1. The formation of the κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure is often accompanied by the migration of large amounts of Zr4+ [15], and this variation tends to start on the surface first. This migration may be less obvious when the ratio of Ce to Zr atoms in the solid solution is close to 1:1, whereas LC and HC samples are accompanied by strong surface elemental changes during the high temperature reduction process. In detail, an obvious increase of surface oxygen vacancies has been introduced in κMC with partial κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure than MC, which could compensate the slight decrease of surface Ce-Ox species to stabilize the supported Pd species in smaller size and higher oxidation states. However, for κHC and κLC, the sharply decreased surface Ce-Ox species than HC and LC may lead to obviously decreased Pd-O-Ce interfaces, which weakened the Pd-support interaction and consequently poor activity with respect to Pd/HC and Pd/LC. 4 Conclusions In this work, a series of CZ supports with varying composition and phase structure have been employed for Pd-only TWCs, then the correlation among the surface element distribution and oxygen vacancies of CZ, the properties of Pd species and the activities have been disclosed. It was found that for catalysts without κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, the activity is positively related with the content of CeO2 in CZ due to the possibly increased Pd-O-Ce interfaces. Distinctly, for catalysts with κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, there exists a balance between the reasonable concentration of oxygen vacancies and surface Ce-Ox species in determining the corresponding activities. Among these catalysts, only the Pd-only TWC with medium content of CeO2 and partial κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure exhibits superior activity than that in the same composition but without κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure. This may be associated with the obviously increased surface oxygen vacancies introduced by κ-Ce2Zr2O8, which could compensate the slight decrease of its surface Ce-Ox species to stabilize the supported Pd species in smaller size and higher oxidation states. This discovery improves the understanding of the relationship between support structure and catalytic activity and contributes to the rational design of efficient heterogeneous catalysts.

        "dc:description": "CeO2-based catalysts have attracted widespread attention in gasoline vehicle exhaust purification, and their catalytic performance is often intimately associated with the supports used. In this work, a series CeO2-ZrO2 (CZ) supports with varying composition and phase structure (with or without partial κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure) have been employed for Pd-only three-way catalysts (TWCs), and the corresponding activities were evaluated. It was found that for catalysts without κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, the activity is positively related with the content of CeO2 in CZ due to the increased Pd-O-Ce interfaces. However, as the formation of κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure is accompanied by the increased surface oxygen vacancies but decreased surface Ce-Ox species, for catalysts with κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure, there exists a balance between the reasonable concentration of oxygen vacancies and surface Ce-Ox species in determining the corresponding activities. Among these catalysts, only the Pd-only TWC with medium content of CeO2 and partial κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure (Pd/κMC) exhibits superior activity than that in the same composition but without κ-Ce2Zr2O8 structure (Pd/MC). This may be associated with the obviously increased surface oxygen vacancies introduced in κMC, which could compensate the slight decrease of its surface Ce-Ox species to stabilize the supported Pd species in smaller size and higher oxidation states. This finding enhances the understanding of support effects to rationally design efficient heterogeneous catalysts.",
