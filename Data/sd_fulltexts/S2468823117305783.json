Graphical abstract A series of gold-palladium catalysts supported in a mesoporous surface functionalized silica SBA-15 was studied for H2O2 direct synthesis. Support functionalization was performed using different organic groups (namely SO3H, NH2 and SH) while metal was then supported by an ion exchanged method. Different Au-Pd/SBA-15 catalysts were tested in the Direct Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide (DSHP). Organic functional groups (SH, SO3H and NH2) with acid-base properties acted as anchoring sites controlling both the dispersion of the metallic active phase and the chemical state of gold and palladium species as Au+ and Pd2+, respectively. Compared to a Au-Pd/SBA-15 system prepared by incipient wetness impregnation over non-functionalized SBA-15, catalytic performance is improved upon functionalization, increasing hydrogen peroxide rate in sulfonic-SBA-15 systems and reducing the hydrogenation/decomposition activity by adding amine groups. The occurrence of amine groups clearly suppresses the support microporosity and probably condition the metal cluster size. The analysis of particle size by TEM showed that sulfonated samples lead to a Pd size compromise which improves the H2O2 production hindering the competitive side reactions, particularly suppressed by the presence of amine groups. Keywords Au-Pd SBA-15 Functionalization H2O2 synthesis Introduction Hydrogen peroxide is an atom efficient reactive in chemical synthesis. From the environmental point of view it is considered as a “green” oxidant since oxygen and water are the only by-products [1]. The estimated annual demand of hydrogen peroxide in 2015 was greater than 4.3 million tons [2]. Actually, this extraordinary demand is met by an indirect process, which produces H2O2 through the sequential hydrogenation and oxidation of a substituted anthraquinone (Anthraquinone Oxidation process, AO). However, this process uses toxic solvents and requires many energy intensive steps for purification of hydrogen [3]. Therefore, direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen has attracted much attention as an economical and environmentally benign process. In this sense, catalytic Direct Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide (DSHP) could reduce significantly the cost of a small-scale hydrogen peroxide production this being useful for its use in inorganic synthesis, household, electronic industry and others applications requiring limited amounts of hydrogen peroxide. One of major problem is that catalysts used for the production of hydrogen peroxide are also active for the combustion of hydrogen to water and the hydrogenation-decomposition of hydrogen peroxide side reactions which reduce the selectivity to hydrogen peroxide (Scheme 1 ). So far, most of reported works are focused on understanding the factors which control both side reactions. In order to achieve high selectivity toward H2O2, one clear constraint for catalyst design is that the HH bonds in H2 should be dissociated while the OO bonds in O2 should be preserved in the course of catalytic reactions. The uncoupling of these competitive reactions from hydrogen peroxide synthesis has been approached through the use of acid and halide promoters [4–7], the modification of support properties [8,9] or by using different metallic catalysts. Among the studied metallic systems, palladium has been traditionally used as active catalyst for DSHP reaction however its catalytic performance was normally hindered by side hydrogenation/decomposition processes [10,11]. Another important and widely studied strategy for enhancing H2O2 selectivity is to alloy active Pd with Au [12,13]. Density functional theory (DFT) proposed that alloying with Au can suppress OO bond dissociation and enhance selectivity toward H2O2 formation. Within this regard, a limiting factor in achieving high selectivity toward H2O2 with Au-Pd based catalysts prepared by the wet impregnation method is that the catalyst nanoparticles exhibit a variation in composition with particle size, with the smallest particles being Pd-rich [14]. Thus, the nature of the catalyst surface, in particular the oxidation state of the active metal, is crucial to obtaining high selectivity. Some studies based in monometallic catalyst of palladium suggest that unsaturated surface atoms of palladium are especially energetic sites for H2 and O2 activation and then for hydrogen peroxide synthesis but also for its successive hydrogenation/decomposition due to the oxygen–oxygen bond cleavage. Acid and/or halide promoters could act as a ligand of these energetic sites inhibiting their activity and reducing the hydrogenation/decomposition rate [15]. Also, gold-palladium alloys had shown an important decrease of hydrogenation/decomposition activity [14,16–18]. Gold could act weakening the interaction of the hydrogen peroxide with the metal surface. Thereby, hydrogen peroxide release rate increases by decreasing the hydrogenation/decomposition activity, which determines the reaction selectivity [19]. Some problems had been observed in the use of inorganic acid and halide promoters such as corrosion of the reactor, metal leaching or the need of purification steps for commercial use which could be eliminated by using acidic or halogenated supports [5,7,20]. In this work, we analysed the physicochemical state of a series of gold-palladium catalytic systems supported in mesoporous silica SBA-15 and its effect in the catalytic performance in the DSHP reaction. The support of SBA-15 was modified on surface by grafting different organic functional groups. These functional groups act as anchor points for the metallic precursors by means of ion exchange thus obtaining a highly dispersed gold-palladium phase. We will try to correlate the interaction between the metallic phase and the support surface, metal dispersion and other important surface features with the catalytic behaviour of the studied systems. Experimental Catalysts preparation Synthesis of the mesoporous support of silica SBA-15 was synthetized according to Zhao et al. [21] using a TEOS:P123:HCl:H2O molar relation of 1:0.02:9.91:320. An acid solution of HCl 2M was added to another one containing P123 dissolved in distilled water. This mixture was stirred at 50°C and then the corresponding amount of TEOS was added. The mixture was kept at such temperature for 18h. The obtained white product was filtered and washed with boiling distilled water, dried under vacuum at 70°C and finally calcined on static air for 3h at 550°C. Functionalization of SBA-15 For SBA-15 functionalization we have considered that bare support would have 1.2 –OHnm−2 [22]. Surface functionalization was achieved by (3-mercaptopropyl)triethoxysilane (MPTES) and (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) which introduced mercapto- and amino- functional groups at the surface of SBA-15. On the basis that the organic molecule will graft to the surface through 3 hydroxyl groups, we used an excess of three times the stoichiometric amount of the functionalizating molecule. In a typical procedure, 0.26mL of MPTES, corresponding to 1.39mmolg−1 SBA-15, was added drop by drop to a toluene solution containing 1g of SBA-15 previously dried at 200°C for 24h. During MPTES addition, the suspension was kept at 70°C with N2 bubbling to assure an anhydrous atmosphere. Then, the mixture was heated at 110°C in a reflux system for 24h. The product was then centrifuged and washed several times with toluene and dichloromethane and finally dried under vacuum at 90°C for 5h. Sample thus obtained was named as SBA-15-SH. For bi-functionalized samples equimolar amount of APTES and MPTES ligands were used. So, following the same procedure, 0.17mL of APTES (0.695mmolg−1 SBA-15) along with 0.13mL of MPTES (0.695mmolg−1 SBA-15) was added to SBA-15 toluene suspension. Thus obtained samples were labelled in this case SBA-15-NH2-SH. Both supports, mono- and bi-functionalized (–SH and –NH2–SH) were used for preparing sulfonated series. Sulfonation was achieved by treating the powders with 30mL of hydrogen peroxide (30% w/v) on stirring for 1h. Then, the solid was filtered and finally treated with H2SO4 2M for 1h. Sulfonated systems were obtained upon filtration and washing with distilled water several times. These supports were labelled SBA-15-SO3H and SBA-15-NH2-SO3H. Gold-palladium loading on different supports In all cases, 250mg of the functionalized support were added to 20mL of a water solution containing the corresponding gold and palladium precursors (HAuCl4 and PdCl2, respectively) for a total metal loading of 5wt% (2.25at%, being the Pd/Au at ratio 1.85). The mixture was stirred during 1h. After that, the coloured powder was recovered by filtration, washing with distilled water and drying under vacuum at 70°C. The catalysts were labelled “Au-Pd/” followed by the name of the support. As a reference, non-functionalized support of SBA-15 was impregnated to incipient wetness with the same palladium and gold precursors and same metal loading. The catalyst was dried under vacuum at 70°C and labelled Au-Pd/SBA-15. Catalysts characterization XRD patterns were recorded in a PANalytical X-Pert PRO diffractometer with a Cu source (λ=1.5418Å, Cu Kα), working in a Bragg-Brentano configuration and equipped with an X’Celerator Detector (active range of 2θ=2.18°). The data acquisition was carry out in a 2θ range of 10–80°, a step of 0.05° and acquisition time of 240s. Transmission electron microscopy was carried out in a Philips CM200 microscope operating at 200kV. Catalysts were dispersed on ethanol and deposited onto a copper grid coated with a lacey carbon film. Histograms for particle size distribution were obtained by counting at least 150 particles. Spectra of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were obtained in a VG-ESCALAB 210 equipment over pelletized samples. Samples were introduced in a pre-chamber at 10−7 Torr. Acquisition was performed in an appendant analysis chamber equipped with a SPECS Phoibos 100 hemispheric analyzer at 10−9 Torr using Mg Kα radiation (E=1253.6eV) with 20mA of anode current and 12kV of potential acceleration. Measures of reduced catalyst were carried out by in situ pre-treatment of samples with H2 at 400°C for 1h in a cell attached to the pre-chamber. Catalytic test DSHP tests were performed in a Teflon batch reactor using 10mg of catalyst dispersed in 10mL of a methanol/water equimolar solution in the absence of acid additive. The mixture was cooled at 2°C and purged with CO2. Then, a sequential introduction of H2, CO2 and O2 was carried out for a total pressure of 40bar (PH2 =1.5bar, PCO2 =35.5bar, PO2 =3.0bar). The use of CO2 as carrier has been widely reported for this reaction. This is due to two important effects: i) CO2 can expand different solvents during the reaction and increase at the same time the H2 solubility, which is particularly significant in the case of mesoporous materials [23] and ii) CO2 in water would form carbonic acid and act as “green” acidic promoter, acidifying the solution and stabilizing the H2O2 formed [24]. The final solution was analysed after 0.5, 2 and 4h by a potentiometric method using potassium permanganate as titration agent (Ti-Touch, Metrohm). Hydrogenation/decomposition of H2O2 test was carried out using similar conditions as DSHP tests but in the absence of oxygen (PH2 =1.5bar, PCO2 =38.5bar) and using a H2O2 starting concentration of 55mmolL−1. After each catalytic reaction, we have also tested the possible metal leaching that could affect to the catalyst performance. For this purpose, we have added certain amount of sodium borohydride to the reaction solution without catalyst. No change in colour was observed so it can be assumed that no metal species are present in the liquid media after the reaction. Results and discussion Direct synthesis and hydrogenation/decomposition of H2O2 Fig. 1 shows the results of hydrogen peroxide production for the different fresh catalytic systems at different reaction times (0.5, 2 and 4h). In terms of total production and after 4h of reaction, sulfonic acid functionalized catalysts (containing SO3H groups) appear as the most active systems (Fig. 1). However, different H2O2 production profiles can be noted and will be discussed. Non-functionalized catalyst (Au-Pd/SBA-15) shows the highest H2O2 production at very short times (30min), however a tiny increase with reaction time is then observed. Sulfonated system (SO3H) shows a very high production rate but after initial marked increase in the production of H2O2, a certain decay in the rate is observed at long reaction times. Improved activity of sulfonic functionalized SBA-15 has been previously reported and was explained by considering that SO3H would serve as an efficient acidic support for direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide [25]. It is worthy to note that for –SH catalyst notably a low H2O2 production is observed, denoting that in this case functionalization drastically hinder the former catalytic performance of un-functionalized SBA-15. Regarding to bi-functionalized systems, it can be assessed that they clearly show a constant production rates leading to progressive higher H2O2 amounts with reaction times. It is surprising the dramatic effect of bi-functionalization in the –NH2–SH sample with respect to –SH sample, which showed the worst H2O2 production. Therefore, it seems that in this case, the occurrence of –NH2 leads to a better catalytic performance. This improving effect is also observed for sulfonated samples, for which the difference is less important. As a summary, higher H2O2 production has been attained for –NH2–SO3H bi-functionalized catalyst showing a production of 110mM after 4h. In order to understand these results it is necessary to consider the activity in the principal competitive side reactions: hydrogenation and decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (Scheme 1). As a result of these side reactions, formed H2O2 would be consumed producing H2O. From these experiments (Fig. 2 ), the lower consumption of hydrogen peroxide is observed for –NH2 bi-functionalized systems, being especially low for Au-Pd/SBA-15-NH2-SH. Such behaviour could explain the linear trend of hydrogen peroxide production observed for this catalyst. On the other side, non-functionalized sample shows the highest activity in the hydrogenation/decomposition reaction and this would explain the slight increase of the produced H2O2. The high extent of H2O2 decomposition would hinder the hydrogenation reaction that seems to reach an almost equilibrium with H2O2 formation with reaction time. Mono-functionalized systems also showed important activity for H2O2 decomposition. It can be argued that the observed differences in the H2O2 production evolution with time could be related to the extent of the equilibrium reached for both processes, formation and decomposition. Thus, it is clear that for –SH catalyst the H2O2 decomposition reaction would be the predominant one, while for –SO3H, H2O2 consumption would be important at higher H2O2 concentrations. Thus, although the initial formation rate was outstanding, at long reaction times the amount of H2O2 it seems to decay. From these considerations, it can be stated that, in terms of total production of hydrogen peroxide, best catalysts are those with sulfonic acid groups in the surface (Fig. 1). However, the stability of the formation process with time seems to be achieved by including amine groups which would inhibit the hydrogenation/decomposition activity. Physicochemical properties of the gold-palladium supported catalysts With the aim of correlating the observed differences in the catalytic performance with catalyst properties, each Au-Pd supported system has been widely characterized. Table 1 contains a summary of the surface and textural features of the studied catalysts. SBA-15 displays type IV adsorption-desorption isotherms, which is typical for mesoporous materials, with H1 hysteresis loop characteristics of highly ordered mesoporous (Fig. 3 A), denoting uniform cylindrical pores closely uniform in size [26]. In addition, from the extent of the adsorbed volume at low P/P0 important microporosity is anticipated. It has been reported that such microporosity is derived from the creation of micropores at the silica walls and depends on the synthesis solution pH and on the acid type used in the synthesis [27,28]. In our parent SBA-15 the ratio between mesopores and micropores is ca. 2, denoting an important contribution of micropores to the total surface area (Table 1). It can be pointed out that as a general trend the former specific surface area for bare SBA-15 significantly decreases upon functionalization and further metal loading (Fig. 3A). Thus, it can be inferred that grafting process of metal particles would block in certain extent the SBA-15 channels diminishing the accessible surface of the structure. This fact would point out that metal grafting would take place inside the SBA-15 channels. Even more, SBA-15 functionalization would affect to the porous structure in different ways, being more noticeable for bi-functionalized samples than for mono-functionalized one. In fact, although capillary condensation step remains similar for mono-functionalized samples with respect non-functionalized one, the initial adsorption corresponding to the presence of microporosity appears notably reduced. Thus, the loss of the microporous channels in bi-functionalized samples seems to be associated to the APTES grafting [29,30]. The obtained BET surface area values for bi-functionalized samples appear notably lower than mono-functionalized systems, showing almost half values in this case. As previously anticipated, by observing the Smeso/Smicro ratio is clearly affected particularly by doubly functionalization (Table 1). Thus, for mono-functionalized systems, the loss in surface area affects in the same way meso- and micro-pores. Though Smeso and Smicro absolute values appear lower than former SBA-15, the Smeso/Smicro remains practically unaffected. The variation in the porous structure is more pronounced for bi-functionalized systems for which remaining micropores results about 15% of the initial value, leading to a Smeso/Smicro ratio notably higher with respect to initial SBA-15. Consequently, amino functionalization would take place selectively at silica walls micropores, leading to either micropore filling or capping by deposited metal nanoparticles. By considering the cumulative pore volume obtained by BHJ method a diminution close to 50% in bi-functionalized catalysts is observed. If we pay attention to the N and S content calculated by XPS (Table 2 ), it can be observed that in spite of that the amount of ligand grafted to the surface should be equal along the whole series (mono- and bi-functionalized), for bi-functionalized samples the S-N content is almost double than for mono-functionalized one. Therefore, the observed decrease in the specific surface area would be induced by a more effective grafting of ligands in these bi-functionalized systems which would indicate the occupation at larger extent of the microporous channels of the SBA-15. By observing the pore size distribution (Fig. 3B), our SBA-15 support exhibits a tight size distribution centered at 3–8nm, pointing out two pore families within the mesoporous range. As previously stated, it is clear that functionalization affects to the pore volumes in all cases. Thus, while mono-functionalization practically does not alter the pore size distribution (and therefore the pore volume) with respect to former SBA-15, doubly functionalization slightly diminishes the pore volume specially those at 5nm size. Therefore though the main diminution is observed in the microporosity, and a certain obstruction of mesopores by metal loading is also expected. Fig. 4 shows the TEM images and histogram of particle size distribution of Au-Pd nanoparticles in fresh catalysts. In all functionalized systems, metal particle size range is narrow with an average value below 4nm. Contrary, for non-functionalized sample a remarkably wider distribution is observed. Moreover, for this later sample, higher metal particles with sizes beyond 20nm seem to be formed by smaller metal clusters that suffer aggregation. Thus, surface functionalization clearly leads to i) a more homogenous distribution of metal particles and ii) higher metal dispersion on the surface. It is worthy to mention that the observed metal particle range is particularly narrow (0.5–1.5nm) in both mercapto-functionalized catalysts (Au-Pd/SBA-15-SH and Au-Pd/SBA-15-NH2-SH), increasing up to 5nm in the sulfonic-functionalized systems (Au-Pd/SBA-15-SO3H and Au-Pd/SBA-15-NH2-SO3H). From this result, it can be argued that further oxidation to achieve sulfonated systems would induce a wider particle size distribution after metal deposition step. The presence of amine group seems to shift also the average particle size to higher values. This tiny effect could be related to the blockage of micropores observed from N2 adsorption-desorption analysis. Moreover, from XRD patterns (Fig. 5 ) it can be detected small peaks associated with a metallic gold phase on both sulfonic group functionalized systems while no palladium phase has been identified in any sample. This clearly points out that the size of such gold particles is large enough to present diffraction peak. From Scherrer equation the calculated mean cluster size for Au-Pd/SBA-15 is ca. 18nm while for sulfonic acid functionalized samples (Au-Pd/SBA-15-SO3H and Au-Pd/SBA-15-NH2-SO3H) Au cluster size is around 30nm. These values are consistent with the above observed values from TEM images. On the contrary, since the crystallite size of palladium is very small, they cannot be detected by XRD, reflecting its high dispersion. The presence of gold diffraction peaks in both –SO3H functionalized catalysts agrees with the occurrence of some larger particle in these samples already claimed from TEM. Such Au particle aggregation could be explained by considering the negatively charged surface that results upon –SH oxidation. As expected a negative zeta potential is observed for these sulfonic-functionalized systems (Table 1). This negative surface of support would prompt a repulsion of negative gold precursor (AuCl4 −) during deposition that would provoke agglomeration of particles and a higher particle size. Indeed, since –NH2–SO3H system showed lower negative surface (−8.3mV) character with respect to –SO3H (−48.1mV), the metal size distribution in that system appeared narrower with average size close to 1–2nm (Fig. 5). In addition, from XPS quantification an unexpected high Pd/Au ratio with respect to the nominal value has been observed (Table 2). This unexpected Pd/Au ratio (5.1 and 4.4 for Au-Pd/SBA-15–SO3H and Au-Pd/SBA-15–NH2–SO3H respectively) would be explained by considering large particle sizes and the subsequent reduction of the metallic phase dispersion. It is worthy to note that –NH2–SH sample also exhibits an outstanding Pd/Au ratio of 4.6 that would be explained by considering a particularly high Pd dispersion in this sample. In a first summary of these results, the presence of sulfonic groups in the catalyst would increase the particle size with the formation of larger Au-rich particles. These systems have demonstrated to be the most active catalyst in the hydrogen peroxide production (Fig. 1). However, its effect over the hydrogenation/decomposition side reaction is uncertain (Fig. 2). Therefore, we should consider both the effect of acid groups but also the changes on metallic dispersion and composition. Moreover, the smallest gold-palladium particles, showed by Au-Pd/SBA-15-SH system, present the lowest hydrogen peroxide production, probably due to the higher extent of hydrogenation/decomposition rate. However, the non-functionalized catalyst is initially the most active in hydrogen peroxide production as well as in hydrogenation/decomposition reaction, and that is surprising if we consider the average particle size which is much bigger in this catalyst. This inverse correlation between productivity and low metal size was widely reported in the literature [31,32]. These authors clearly stated that the production rate decreased along with the decrease of Pd particle size. However, the situation of metal species at the surface is also a crucial parameter that strongly affect to this reaction [33]. So, a deeper inspection of the surface properties and chemical state of surface species arises necessary in order to clarify the different catalytic behaviours. Surface study of the gold-palladium catalytic systems by XPS The state of functional groups in the support surface was analysed by XPS. Fig. 6 plots the recorded signals of S 2s and N 1s regions corresponding to surface thio- and amino- functional groups. It is reported that the binding energy of S 2s level associated to mercapto SH group is located at around 226eV [34], while sulfonated groups gives a S2s binding energy of ca 233eV [35]. By observing the S 2s peak for sulfonate functionalized samples, two clear contributions can be observed at 232 and 226eV which denotes the simultaneous presence of SH and SO3H groups at the surface. Therefore, the complete oxidation of starting mercapto groups is not achieved. By deconvoluting the S 2s peak, the oxidation extent is around 44% and 75% on Au-Pd/SBA-15-SO3H and Au-Pd/SBA-15-NH2-SO3H, respectively. Thus, it can be noted that the occurrence of NH2 would favour the oxidation of SH towards SO3H. Regarding the N 1s XP spectra, two components can be observed: a low binding energy contribution at 400eV due to NH2 groups, and a high binding energy component at 402eV attributed to NO or NH3 + [36]. The simultaneous surface functionalization with APTES and MPTES would induce a slight protonation of amine functional groups. This fact is in agreement to the highly positive surface zeta potential observed for NH2 SH sample, which is notably more positive than SH one (Table 1). Additionally, upon further oxidation to achieve SO3H, this surface amine groups also suffer a certain oxidation toward NO. As stated, this partial oxidation also affects to the surface potential turning in this case slightly negative by the presence of SO3H. It can be assumed that formed NO groups are not available for Au metal linkage, so lower metal dispersion would be anticipated. In fact, in spite of the less negative surface charge character similar Pd/Au value was attained pointing out Au aggregation. Au 4f and Pd 3d signals were also analysed in the fresh samples (Fig. 7 A). For non-functionalized catalyst, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, it has been detected the presence of two peaks in the Pd 3d signal, one centered at 335.1eV, near to the assigned value of Pd0 in reduced systems (Fig. 7B) and a second centered at ∼336.8eV, assigned to Pd2+, with an estimated Pd0/Pd2+ atomic ratio around 0.6. Functionalized samples show a single Pd 3d5/2 peak centered at ∼337.5eV, which can be attribute to Pd2+. No contribution at lower binding energy is detected, denoting that for these samples Pd appears only in the oxidized state. This means that the ion exchange method provides a unique Pd2+ phase in contrast to impregnation method which leads to both Pd2+ and Pd0 phases. Moreover, functionalized series exhibits a slight shift of ca 1eV in the Pd 3d5/2 binding energies with respect to that observed in the non-functionalized sample (Fig. 7A). Even more, –SO3H functionalized samples also denotes a small shift toward higher energy values. It has been widely reported that Pd binding energy is very sensitive to the metal particle size [37,38]. In this sense, Yuranov et al. distinguished three chemical states of palladium from Pd 3d5/2 signal at binding energies of 336.5 and 337.7eV, attributed to bulk and highly dispersed PdO, respectively. An additional higher binding energy at 338.5eV was assigned to PdO2 or extremely small PdO particles, stabilized by silica support lattice [39]. Therefore we may infer that Pd particles in the non-functionalized sample appears forming large clusters. Therefore, surface functionalization of support not only stabilizes the oxidized state but also induces the dispersion of metal particles. This high dispersion would be even more marked for – SO3H systems. In this sense, Hutchings et al. already reported that a higher surface concentration of Pd2+ on a Pd–Au/TiO2 catalyst could enhance activity [40]. Similarly, Ouyang et al. also related the activity to the occurrence of PdO domains [41]. On the other side, regarding to Au 4f7/2 signal, non-functionalized system shows a binding energy value associated to Au0. Contrarily, binding energies for functionalized samples appear 1eV over that for Au0, which can be attributed to Au+/Auδ+ species. Moreover, sulfonated systems clearly show a scarce Au 4f signal. In fact the Pd/Au ratio calculated by XPS for these samples was notably low (Table 1). As above discussed, this would indicate an extraordinary aggregation of Au clusters. Indeed, those samples also depicted noticeable XRD peaks corresponding to Au phase. Therefore, from XPS results it can be proposed that SO3H systems provide a situation in which Pd and Au would show drastically different sizes, highly disperse for Pd and aggregated for Au. The presence of this metallic phase on non-functionalized system could be correlated to the particular catalytic behaviour of Au-Pd/SBA-15 sample. As stated, that sample showed scarce H2O2 production with time that was associated to the high activity for H2O2 decomposition. In principle, the activity toward hydrogenation/decomposition reactions would be associated to the occurrence of metallic phase. So, in order to understanding the influence of the chemical state in the catalytic performance we have studied the catalytic behaviour of systems after reduction treatment (Fig. 8 ). After reduction with H2, all catalytic systems contain only Pd0 and Au0 species (Fig. 7B). In this case, the slight decrease in the Pd/Au was due to the diminution in the Pd at content. Thus, reduction process would affect in a greater extent to Pd particles which would grow and suffer agglomeration. Indeed, if we notice the Pd 3d spectra, an evident shift to lower binding energy is observed for the non-functionalized catalyst. As previously stated, it can be established a clear dependence between particle size and binding energy in palladium catalysts, that could be applicable in this case and agrees with the slightly lower Pd/Au with respect to fresh series. Hydrogen peroxide production rate decreases dramatically after the reduction treatment (Fig. 8). By observing hydrogenation/decomposition reactions activity, the lower catalytic performance for H2O2 production was due to a very important increase in the activity, with more than a 50% of hydrogen peroxide consumed during the first 20min in all catalysts. Given the minor variation in particle size observed by TEM (Fig. 9 ), increasing slightly in all cases, this radical change in activity could be attributable to the metallic state [33]. Indeed, Choudhary et al. already pointed out that catalyst properties such as particle size and surface area were found to be less important than the oxidation state in determining the H2O2 selectivity. As reported in the literature, the most active catalyst is that showing the smallest particle size. However, we have demonstrated that this relationship is true for both hydrogen peroxide synthesis and hydrogen peroxide hydrogenation/decomposition reactions [32]. Smaller particles have more quantity of low coordinated atoms where hydrogenation/decomposition reaction is more favourable [42]. So, it is clear that the stabilization of an oxidized Au-Pd phase is required for a high selectivity in the DSHP reaction. On the other hand, zeta potential did not show a direct influence with hydrogen peroxide production or hydrogenation/decomposition activity which is indicated by other authors [31], probably due to a stronger influence of the functional groups (Fig. 10 ). Conclusions Functionalization of a mesoporous silica SBA-15 support by means of mercapto/sulfonic groups allows controlling the gold-palladium dispersion and therefore the particle size distribution by mean of an ion exchange synthesis method. Also, oxidation state of palladium and gold is stabilized as Pd2+, Au+, respectively. This fact turns particularly important since metallic gold-palladium increases markedly hydrogenation/decomposition side reaction activity. Regarding to the catalytic performance, very small particles obtained in Au-Pd/SBA-15-SH are the least active system due to the high rate in the competitive hydrogenation/decomposition reaction. On the other hand, sulfonic-functionalized systems increase the particle size and also the hydrogen peroxide production rate. The average Pd particle size achieved in these samples turns good compromise between a high metal dispersion necessary for high catalytic activity and the presence of less energetic sites, on which O2 can chemisorb without dissociation. Furthermore, these samples exhibited large Au cluster formation, which would be detrimental for side H2O2 decomposition reaction. Finally, the inclusion of amine groups on the catalyst does not affect to the particle size distribution but it increases the hydrogen peroxide production rate by an important decrease in the hydrogenation/decomposition activity. The occurrence of amine groups at the surface would therefore favours the selectivity of the DSHP reaction by clearly supressing the competitive H2O2 decomposition.

        "dc:description": "A series of gold-palladium catalysts supported in a mesoporous surface functionalized silica SBA-15 was studied for H2O2 direct synthesis. Support functionalization was performed using different organic groups (namely SO3H, NH2 and SH) while metal was then supported by an ion exchanged method. Different Au-Pd/SBA-15 catalysts were tested in the Direct Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide (DSHP). Organic functional groups (SH, SO3H and NH2) with acid-base properties acted as anchoring sites controlling both the dispersion of the metallic active phase and the chemical state of gold and palladium species as Au+ and Pd2+, respectively. Compared to a Au-Pd/SBA-15 system prepared by incipient wetness impregnation over non-functionalized SBA-15, catalytic performance is improved upon functionalization, increasing hydrogen peroxide rate in sulfonic-SBA-15 systems and reducing the hydrogenation/decomposition activity by adding amine groups. The occurrence of amine groups clearly suppresses the support microporosity and probably condition the metal cluster size. The analysis of particle size by TEM showed that sulfonated samples lead to a Pd size compromise which improves the H2O2 production hindering the competitive side reactions, particularly suppressed by the presence of amine groups.",
