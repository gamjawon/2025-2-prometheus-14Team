Rohan, B.K. Hodnett * Dept. of Chemical and Environmental Sciences, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland Received 27 April 1996; revised 9 June 1996; accepted 9 June 1996 Abstract Vanadium oxide catalysts supported on titanium oxide have been tested as catalysts for the selective oxidation of butan-2-ol to methylethylketone by hydrogen peroxide at 90 with a mixture of acetone and water as solvent. A range of catalyst preparation methods were used including wet impregnation and grafting and a number of unsupported oxides were also tested. The main side product observed was acetic acid, probably derived from oxidation of the enol form of methylethylketone. The selectivity of alcohol utilization was always better than the correspond- ing value for oxidant utilization for all catalysts studied and at all conversion levels. None of the catalysts tested were stable to leaching in the reaction environment. A steady state vanadium concentration became established in the reaction medium a short time after the reaction started. An attempt was made to differentiate between the contribution to the observed catalysis by the homogeneous and heterogeneous forms of vanadium present in the reactor. No correlation was observed between the amount of dissolved vanadium species and the catalytic activity, but there was a correlation between the activity and the total amount of vanadium species present. In addition, the selectivity improved as the dispersion of the vanadium oxide on the surface of the titania increased. Keywords: Vanadium; Butan-2-ol; Hydrogen peroxide I.

Rohan, B.K. Hodnett /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997)409-422 usually supported on inert, high surface area supports, most often A1203, SiO2 or TiO2. Vanadia-titania catalysts possess high activity and selectivity in processes of industrial importance such as the oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride and in the reduction of NO by NH3. Other studies carried out using the V2Os/TiO2 system include the oxidation of butene and butadiene to maleic anhydride [4], and the gas-phase oxidation of toluene to benzoic acid [5]. Very little research has been carried out on the applicability of the V2Os/TiO2 system to liquid phase oxidation, which usually requires the use of a strong oxidant, such as hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is a weight efficient oxidising agent which yields water and oxygen only on decomposition [6]. This oxidant is used extensively with titanium silicalite in studies of fine chemicals production using heterogenous catalysts and examples of its application include the oxidation of alcohols to ketones and aldehydes, the epoxidation of olefins and the hydroxylation of phenols and other aromatics [7]. However, titanium silicalite is difficult to synthesise in a reproducible fashion, whereas little information is available in the literature concerning the applicability of the simpler vanadia/titania catalysts to oxidation reactions occurring in the liquid phase. In this work, we report on the liquid phase selective oxidation of butan-2-ol to methylethylketone (MEK) over vanadia/titania and other vanadium contain- ing catalysts by hydrogen peroxide. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation and characterisation For the selective oxidation of butan-2-ol, vanadia/titania catalysts containing varying V loadings (w/w) were prepared with titania from different sources. Vanadium-phosphorous oxide and vanadium-magnesium oxide catalysts were also prepared. All of the prepared catalysts were dissolved in HF and subse- quently analysed by atomic absorption spectroscopy to determine the vanadium contents. Surface areas were measured on a 'Micromeritics' Gemini 2370 Surface Area Analyser, coupled with a Flowprep 060 Degasser using the BET isotherm equation. 2.2. Vanadia / titania catalysts (sol-gel precipitation) A 1% V2Os/TiO2 catalyst prepared by gel supported precipitation, was supplied by Agip. Before use the catalyst was activated by calcination in air overnight at 500. D. Rohan, B.K. Hodnett /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997)409-422 411 2.3. Vanadia / titania catalysts (wet impregnation) Vanadia-titania catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation in aqueous medium. Titanium dioxide, anatase (Fluka, surface area 8 m2/g) was impreg- nated with the required amount of NH4VO3 (BDH, general purpose reagent) to yield the required % vanadium (w/w). 75 ml of distilled water was then added and the resultant white suspension was stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Excess water in the suspension was removed at 45-50 in a rotatory evapora- tor at reduced pressure. The catalyst was then calcined in air at 400 for 6 h. The vanadium loadings varied from 0.5% V to 3% V. 2.4. Vanadia / titania catalysts (grafted) Vanadia-titania catalysts were also prepared in an organic medium using a method developed by van Hengstrum [8]. Vanadium acetylacetonate VO(acac)2 (9.4 g, Aldrich, general purpose reagent) was dissolved in toluene (750 ml, Merck, high purity reagent). Titanium dioxide (7.0 g, Degussa-P25, surface area 50 m2/g) was then added and the resultant suspension was continuously stirred under a blanket of nitrogen for 10 days at room temperature. The suspension was filtered and washed thoroughly with toluene (100 ml). The precursor was dried initially in air at 140 for 1.5 h and calcined at 450 for 2 h. A washed-grafted catalyst was also prepared. This technique involved reflux- ing 1 g of the grafted catalyst in 250 ml of 35% H202 (w/v) at 90 for 3 h. This technique involved removal of vanadium from the surface of the catalyst by the leaching action of hydrogen peroxide. Leaching was carried out 6 times, i.e. until no more vanadium was being leached into solution. 2.5. Vanadium-phosphorous oxide catalyst Vanadium-phosphorous oxide catalyst was prepared in an organic medium using the method outlined by McCullagh et al. [9]. V205 (9.1 g, Reidel-de-HaEn, general purpose reagent) and 85% H3PO4 (11.35 g, Romil, general purpose reagent) was refluxed for 3 h in isobutanol (200 ml, Merck, general purpose reagent), allowed to cool and filtered using Whatman No. 42 filter paper. The residue which featured vanadium largely in the 4 oxidation state was dried in a vacuum oven at 120 for 2 h. This catalyst precursor was subsequently calcined at 450 for 2 h in air yielding a VPO catalyst with a nominal P:V ratio of 1:1. 2.6. Vanadium-magnesium oxide catalyst Vanadium-magnesium oxide catalyst was prepared in an organic medium using a method reported by Bhattacharyva et al. [10]. NH4OH (28-30%) (21.46 412 D. Rohan, B.K. Hodnett / Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997)409-422 ml, BDH, general purpose reagent) was dissolved in 1 1 of water (Standard Chemical Limited, H.P.L.C. grade) and NH4VO3 (5 g BDH, analar reagent) added. The solution was heated to 70 and under continuous stirring, MgO (1.72 g, BDH, general purpose reagent) was added. The suspension was left overnight to evaporate to dryness and the resultant yellow solid was calcined in air at 550 for 6 h. 2.7. Catalyst testing experiments Catalytic experiments were carried out in the liquid-phase in a Parr 2-1 batch stainless steel stirred pressure reactor (model 4522). The stirring rate was 600 r.p.m. A needle valve was attached to the liquid outlet to facilitate withdrawal of samples. The reactions were carded out in a three phase system, viz., a solid catalyst phase, an aqueous phase, and an organic phase. The reaction system was operated at autogenous pressures (0-I0 atm.) and reaction temperature was controlled using a Parr 4821 automatic temperature controller. The following quantities were the standard reaction conditions used, unless otherwise stated: butan-2-ol (690 mmole (64 ml), Lab Scan, general purpose reagent), aq. H202 (35% w/v) (70 ml), Reidel-de-HaEn, general purpose reagent), acetone (solvent, 90 ml, Rathbum, glass distilled grade), catalyst x% V/TiO2 (1 g, where x varied from 0 to 9.2% V w/w). All reactions were carried out at 90 for 3 h. Note: the catalyst was enclosed in a glass vial. The experiments were performed by charging the reactor with the reagents, followed by heating to the required temperature. Once the reaction temperature was reached the reaction was started by breaking the glass vial which contained the catalyst. Approximately 10 ml aliquots of reaction mixture were withdrawn at specified intervals. The reaction mixture was analysed with a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph (GC) fitted with a Porapak T column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with helium as the carder gas. THF was the internal standard. Potentiometric titration with CeSO4 was used to determine the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the reaction mixture. Additional analysis for dissolved vanadium was carried out using atomic absorption spectroscopy on a Varian Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer-400 using a nitrous oxide-acetylene flame at 318.2 nm. 2.8. Dispersion measurements by oxygen chemisorption The dispersion measurements of the catalysts were carried out using an oxygen chemisorption technique developed by Oyama et al. [11]. Catalyst samples of 0.2 g were held in place with quartz glass, in a 1/4\" stainless steel tube 6\" in length. This was then placed in a Varian 3300 GC oven and heated to the required temperature. Prior to any adsorption measurements the sample was D. Rohan, B.K. Hodnett / Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997)409-422 413 initially left to equilibrate for 10 rain at the required temperature under flowing He (25 ml/min) until a steady baseline was achieved. The sample was then reduced in flowing H2 (25 ml/min) for 1 h at 368. After reduction the sample was left to equilibrate in flowing He (25 ml/min) for 20 min before 02 chemisorption was carried out, again at 368. Reduction and O2 chemisorption was also carried out on the support under the conditions previously outlined above. The reduced sample was pulsed every 60 s with 1 /xmol of 02 until peaks of constant area were obtained. 2.9.

D. Rohan, B.K. Hodnett /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 409-422 417 this work a wide range of titania supported vanadium oxide catalysts have been prepared by a wide variety of methods including impregnation, sol-gel precipi- tation and grafting and a small number of unsupported complex oxides of vanadium have also been used. Vanadium loadings ranged from close to zero to as high as 9.2% and surface areas were in the range 1.8 to 55 m2 g-1 for the vanadium oxide catalysts. Dispersions of vanadium oxides were generally less than 10% according to the oxygen chemisorption method. Figs. 1 and 2 show the catalytic activity in terms of hydrogen peroxide and butan-2-ol conversions and yields of MEK and acetic acid as well as the profiles for the dissolution of vanadium into the reacting medium for two of the catalysts listed in Table 1, namely 0.12% V/TiO2 (D) and 1% V/TiO2 (F), respectively. Several features in these figures were common to all the catalysts tested in this study. The first of these is the greater conversion of hydrogen peroxide than butan-2-ol leading in all cases to a lower value for selectivity of use of the oxidant (SELox) than the corresponding value for selectivity of use of the alcohol (SELAL).

Rohan, B.K. Hodnett / Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997)409-422 between the consumption of the hydrogen peroxide and the alcohol and the appearance of the products. Acetic acid was always produced in lesser quantity than MEK and is postulated here to come from oxidation of the enol form of the ketone. All the vanadium oxide catalysts tested released vanadium into the reacting medium and the amounts leached in this way varied with the catalysts used. In general, supported and unsupported vanadium oxide catalysts are very unstable in the reaction environment at all loadings examined. The vanadium was initially leached into the solution at a high rate and reached a steady state after 20-30 min. For example, after 15 min 75% of the vanadium was lost from 0.12% V/TiO2 and 50% from 1% V/TiO2. Table 2 summarises some key parameters for the range of catalysts tested in this work in terms of hydrogen peroxide and butan-2-ol conversion and the two selectivity parameters followed, namely (SELAL) and (SELox) measured after 30 min in the reacting medium. Figs. 3 and 4 show selectivity-conversion plots in terms of alcohol and oxidant conversions for varying initial concentrations of alcohol and hydrogen peroxide. In all cases studied, the selectivity in terms of utilization of the alcohol was better than the corresponding value measured in terms of the oxidant. In addition both measures of selectivity increased as the alcohol concentration increased, but were largely unaffected by changes in the initial concentration of hydrogen peroxide. An important feature of this study was to determine if the dissolved vanadium or the titania supported vanadia was responsible for the observed catalytic activity. With this in mind initial rates of hydrogen peroxide and butan-2-ol consumption and initial rates of MEK and acetic acid production were deter- mined for the catalysts listed in Table 2 and plotted against the steady state 100 8O 6O + 4O 20 ,~K 0 0 i t r I 400 800 1200 1600 2000 Total V in reactor (micro moles) I t10,V/Ti02 OOg O%V/Ti02 & 0.12%V/Ti02 XO.Sg 0.3%Vf'1-i02 -- 0.5%V/Ti02 0 0.Sg 1%V/1\"i02 X o.64%vfri02 + 1%V/Ti02 0 2%Vfii02 028 1%V/Ti02 A3%V/TJ02 A:3g 1%V.0\"i02 9.2%V/Ti02 O.Sg 9.2%V/Ti02 Fig. 5.

There was no correlation for any of the parameters of catalyst activity studied and the concentration of vanadium in solution. In a further series of experiments the percentage conversions of H202 and butan-2-ol measured after 30 rain of reaction were plotted against the total amount of vanadium present in the reactor and these results are presented in Figs. 5 and 6. Here a more coherent relationship is observed so that no further increase in conversion was observed when more than about 600 /zmol of vanadium were present in the reactor. From Figs. 5 and 6 it is evident that H202 and butan-2-ol conversions depend 100 80 60 .> 40 cn 20 i i i 0 2 4 6 8 I Vanadium Oxide Dispersion (~) Fig. 7.

Hodnett /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 409-422 on the total amount of vanadium in the reactor. The conversions obtained for 2 g of 1% V/TiO2 were identical to those obtained for 1 g of 2% V/TiO2. Similar conversions were also obtained for 0.5 g of 1% V/TiO2 and 1 g of 0.5 V/TiO2, and also for 3 g of 1% V/TiO2 and 1 g of 3% V/TiO2. Thus, the oxidation of butan-2-ol by H202 lacks structure-sensitivity and depends on the number of vanadium centres present in the reactor. Further evidence for the role of supported vanadium species can be got from Fig. 7 which shows the relationship between selectivity at a fixed alcohol conversion and the dispersion of the vanadium oxide species on the support surface, as measured by oxygen chemisorption. These data clearly show a relationship between the dispersion of the vanadium and the selectivity at fixed conversion. 4. Discussion This study has demonstrated a number of aspects of the applicability of vanadium oxide catalysts for hydrogen peroxide mediated oxidations. This discussion will concentrate on the stability of the catalysts, the role of vanadium acting in a homogeneous and heterogeneous fashion and the relationship be- tween the selectivity of utilization of the alcohol and the oxidant. The vanadia/titania catalysts and vanadium oxide catalysts tested were very unstable in the reaction environment. Hydrogen peroxide leached the vanadium off the surface of the catalyst, suggesting that hydrogen peroxide is a very active and powerful oxidant. None of the catalysts were resistant to the leaching action of the hydrogen peroxide. This finding is in agreement with other oxidation work carried out with hydrogen peroxide over vanadium oxide catalysts, which also proved unsuccessful in stabilisation of the vanadium on the surface of the catalysts [12,13]. The mechanism of leaching is clearly associated with the presence of hydrogen peroxide and not the other components present in the reactor as no leaching was observed in the absence of hydrogen peroxide. A yellow solution formed in the reaction mixture and this is consistent with the formation of diperoxoorthovanadate [VO2(O2)2]3- which gives a yellow colour in neutral or alkaline solutions of hydrogen peroxide [14]. The amount of vanadium which was leached into solution was dependent to some extent on the amount of vanadium on the catalyst and also on the activity of the vanadium for the selective oxidation of butan-2-ol to MEK. In other words, a competition existed for the available hydrogen peroxide between the selective oxidation reaction and the leaching reaction. This is more clearly understood by comparison of the results obtained from the testing of VPO and VMgO oxide catalysts (see Table 2). High reactivity for the selective oxidation of butan-2-ol was observed for the VPO catalyst whereas for the VMgO catalyst no catalytic activity was observed. VPO is an acidic catalyst whereas VMgO is a D. Rohan, B.K. Hodnett / Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 409-422 421 basic catalyst [15]. Butan-2-ol does not adsorb on the surface of VMgO resulting in no selective oxidation reaction taking place. Consequently, more hydrogen peroxide is present in the reactor and within 30 rain of the start of the reaction all of the available vanadium had leached off the surface of the catalyst and into solution. VPO on the other hand is an acidic catalyst where butan-2-ol readily adsorbs on its surface and is selectively converted to MEK. H202 participates in this reaction, thus less hydrogen peroxide is available for the leaching reaction. This point can be further illustrated by reference to the series of catalysts 1-3% V/TiO2 (F) which clearly shows increased conversion of hydrogen peroxide and butan-2-ol as the vanadium loading was increased, but the amount of dissolved vanadium actually decreased (see Table 2). Hence, we conclude that there was competition between the oxidation reaction and the leaching reaction for the available hydrogen peroxide. It is clear from Figs. 5-7 that although there is no clear correlation between the amounts of dissolved vanadium present in the reactor and the reactivity there are strong indications that the bulk of the reactivity is derived from the heterogeneous form of the vanadium oxide present. This conclusion is tempered by the fact that dissolved vanadium does indeed contribute to the overall reactivity and when only dissolved vanadium is present then some reactivity is observed, but the correlations observed do point to a more prominent role for the heterogeneous form of the vanadium as being important in the reaction. Within this context it appears that the form of the supported vanadium is not important, moreover that the determining factor is simply the amount of vanadium actually present in the reactor. A clear drawback of the vanadium oxide system is the poor selectivity particularly observed for the parameter SELox. This parameter was always less than the corresponding value recorded for SELAL, and was due no doubt to the occurrence of side reactions associated with utilization of some of the hydrogen peroxide in the leaching reaction and also due to the loss of some hydrogen peroxide through decomposition without reacting with the alcohol. The parame- ter SELox did improve as the initial concentration of butan-2-ol in the reactor was increased, and this again probably represented competition between the selective oxidation of butan-2-ol to MEK and the side reactions not involving encounter between the alcohol and the oxidant.

A range of catalyst preparation methods were used including wet impregnation and grafting and a number of unsupported oxides were also tested. The main side product observed was acetic acid, probably derived from oxidation of the enol form of methylethylketone. The selectivity of alcohol utilization was always better than the corresponding value for oxidant utilization for all catalysts studied and at all conversion levels. None of the catalysts tested were stable to leaching in the reaction environment. A steady state vanadium concentration became established in the reaction medium a short time after the reaction started. An attempt was made to differentiate between the contribution to the observed catalysis by the homogeneous and heterogeneous forms of vanadium present in the reactor. No correlation was observed between the amount of dissolved vanadium species and the catalytic activity, but there was a correlation between the activity and the total amount of vanadium species present. In addition, the selectivity improved as the dispersion of the vanadium oxide on the surface of the titania increased. Keywords Vanadium Butan-2-ol Hydrogen peroxide References [1] D.J.
