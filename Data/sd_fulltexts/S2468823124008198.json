The potential significance of electrocatalytic urea synthesis as a promising alternative to traditional manufacture is widely recognized. However, the critical hindrance is lack of its highly efficient and robust electrocatalysts until now. Alongside the exploration of novel urea catalysts, it is equally crucial to explore feasible strategies to boost the performance of the identified active sites. In this work, we proposed and demonstrated a modulatory scheme to further promote urea production in Ru-Co dual-metal sites through the substitution of electron-deficient B atom in RuN3 subunit to form RuN2B-CoN4 moiety in graphene. The B-coordinated Ru active site can effectively decrease charge transfer amount from the Ru atom to the substrate. The enhanced single-atomic similarity to free Ru atom results in more negative adsorption energy for N2 molecule and superior catalytic activity/selectivity for urea generation. More significantly, this study provides a new perspective to promote the catalytic performance of the carbon-based diatomic active sites for urea production.

The industrial urea production operates under severe high-pressure conditions (150–250 bar) and elevated temperature (150–200 °C), which leads to massive energy consumption and immense CO2 emission [4–7]. Therefore, the current urea manufacturing process is far away from the demands for environmentally friendly and sustainable development. In the last few years, electrocatalytic urea production driven by renewable electricity has been a promising approach to reduce the impacts to the environment [8–12]. However, the electrocatalytic urea production remains many challenges, caused by the activation of the sturdy NN triple bond [13–15], the coupling mechanism of C-N reaction [16–19], the inevitable side reactions [20], and so on. In order to conquer these obstacles, the most effective method is to design the high-performance electrocatalysts [21–26]. Dual atom catalysts (DACs) in graphene have received significant interest in the field of urea synthesis which possess flexible active sites when acting in isolation and offer more probability to create the synergistic effect, thereby produce higher yield and achieve higher Faraday efficiency [27–35]. For example, the bonded Fe-Ni diatomic pairs and the Zn-Mn diatomic sites with axial chloride coordination both can enhance the crucial C-N coupling and achieve high-efficiency urea production in experiment [36,37]. The dispersed dual-metals in MN3-MN3 moiety can serve as promising active sites for urea production, and then the inherent principal descriptor and its effective range in high-throughput methods for metal anchored on N-doped graphene to synthesize urea was proposed by us [38]. Meanwhile, the synergetic MN3-M'N3 moiety on defective graphene presents the apparent regularity between the catalytic activity and the adsorption energy of the key intermediate *NCONH for urea production [38]. Almost simultaneously, the outstanding activity in constructed dual-atom V2N6@graphene towards urea formation was also theoretically confirmed with the limiting potential of -0.26 V, and the vital mechanism of the weakened NN bond by the protonation step coupling with *CO was demonstrated [39]. Subsequently, the RuN3-CoN4@graphene with prominent catalytic performance and experimental synthesis basis was screened through series of screening criteria from the proposed MN3-M'N4 moiety by us, on which two active sites can separately adsorb N2 and CO2 and jointly catalyze C-N coupling reaction [40,41]. These studies consistently demonstrate the tremendous feasibility for urea production through MNx-M'Ny moiety. Comparing with the exploration on novel urea catalysts, it is equally crucial to further boost the performance of the identified active sites. To adjust the catalytic activity of DACs, it needs to consider not only the metal site, but also the adjacent coordinating atom [42–45]. The dual-single-atom catalyst FeN2S-CoN2S decorated on porous carbon nanosheets was prepared experimentally, of which N/S-coordinated metal sites can optimize the adsorption of key intermediates thereby showed excellent bifunctional performance of oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) [43]. A series of asymmetric diatomic configurations involving FeN3-FeN2S [46], FeN3O-CuN4 [47] were designed, in which the metal sites can absorb *OH more appropriately, leading to better ORR performance. The coordinating P atom in FeN3-FeN2P bimetallic site can modulate the oxidation state of Fe, facilitating the binding of intermediates in the catalytic process and therefore the outstanding ORR properties were triggered [48]. Theoretically, a symmetry-breaking active site of FeCxBy was designed and the d-band center of Fe can be manipulated by coordinating B atom was indicated by Huang, which facilitates CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) [49]. He also demonstrated TM-B diatomic site was superior over single metal site in promoting CO2RR, at which Fe@B-C2 N showed the lowest barrier in C-C coupling [50]. Motivated by the advances on non-nitrogen coordination and their potentiality on altering the catalytic performance of active metals, single coordinating X atom (X = B, C, O, P, S) was selected to replace N atom in RuN3-CoN4@graphene (@graphene shortened as @G in the following part) and their catalytic feasibility for urea formation were systematically investigated in this work. Notably, our calculated data clearly indicates that the substitution of electron-deficient B atom adjacent to Ru site could effectively diminish the charge transfer amount from Ru atom to the substrate. The single-atomic similarity to free Ru in active site results in the more negative adsorption energy for N2 molecule and the superior catalytic activity/selectivity for urea generation ultimately. 2 Results and discussions 2.1 Structures and stabilities of RuN2X-CoN4@G and RuN3-CoN3 X@G The electronic properties and the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts are not only relevant with the active center, but also governed by their coordination environment, especially the directly coordination atom. Considering the atomic radius and bonding capability, five usual nonmetallic atoms (B, C, O, P, S) were chosen to replace seven various coordinating-N atoms in the RuN3-CoN4@G structure. Thus, 35 potential configurations including 15 potential RuN2X-CoN4@G and 20 potential RuN3-CoN3X@G (X = B, C, O, P, S), are constructed [Fig. 1 (a), the detailed structure information shown in Fig. S1]. It is well known that the robust structural integrity is the most important factor for long-lasting catalysts. Therefore, the binding energies (Ebind) of Ru atom and Co atom in 35 RuN2X-CoN4@G/RuN3-CoN3X@G structures are computed to quantitatively assess their stability [Fig. 1(b), Table S1]. The Ebind of Co atom in RuN2X-CoN4@G and the Ebind of Ru atom in RuN3-CoN3X@G systems remain slightly changed (4.38 ∼ 5.56 eV for Ru atom, 7.18 ∼ 7.79 eV for Co atom) in comparison with those in pristine RuN3-CoN4@G system [40]. The Ebind of Co atom in 20 RuN3-CoN3X@G (5.69 ∼ 8.36 eV) are stronger than that of Ru atom in 15 RuN2X-CoN4@G systems (3.07 ∼ 6.68 eV), indicating the better stability of Co atom in substrate. Comparing with the N7-coordinated RuN3-CoN4@G system, the Ru atom and Co atom in systems (RuN2X-CoN4@G/RuN3-CoN3X@G) after single B, O, P, S-substitution possess the lower binding energies, whereas those after C- substitution show the higher binding energies. Notably, the Ebind of Ru atom and Co atom drops to the lowest values (3.07 eV and 5.69 eV) when the O atom coordinates with the metal center. Nevertheless, the computed Ebind of Ru atom and Co atom in all systems are higher than 3.00 eV, suggesting the enough interaction between Ru/Co atom and varied coordination environment in graphene. Therefore, the as-designed 35 RuN2X-CoN4@G/RuN3-CoN3X@G structures all possess required stability, which satisfies the prerequisite for further investigation. 2.2 Electronic properties of RuN2X-CoN4@G and RuN3-CoN3 X@G The performance of electrocatalysts is essentially dominated by the electronic properties of the active sites, which could be regulated through the replacement of the coordination atoms. Therefore, the Bader charge transfer (CT) amount from metals to substrate is computed, because it can reflect the adjusted effectiveness on Ru and Co active sites to a large extent. The results show that the CT value of Ru atom is in the range from 0.23 |e| to 0.69 |e| and Co atom is in the range from 0.54 |e| to 0.89 |e| [Fig. 2 (a)-2(b), Table S2] when the coordinating-N atom is replaced by single B, C, O, P, S atom, which are all lower than those of Ru atom (0.84 |e|) and Co atom (0.99 |e|) in the pristine RuN3-CoN4@G system [40]. Notably, the CT of Ru atom in RuN2X-CoN4@G (X = B, C, O, P, S) presents three different sets of values: (i) the higher CT values of Ru atom with single C, O, S-coordination systems (0.60 ∼ 0.69 |e|); (ii) the medium CT value of Ru atom with single P-coordination systems (0.44 ∼ 0.49 |e|); (iii) the lower CT value of Ru atom with single B-coordination systems (0.23 ∼ 0.29 |e|). These data suggested that the activity of the embedded central metals could be modified by their coordinating atoms. To be specific, the larger CT values of Ru atom in group (i) can be attributed to the higher electronegativity of C, O, S atoms (2.55 for C, 3.44 for O, 2.58 for S), and the medium CT value in group (ii) is due to the weaker electronegativity of P atom (2.19). It was also found that there is a linear increase between charge transfer of Ru/Co with the corresponding binding energies in B, O, P and S-coordination systems, which indicates that higher CT associates with the stronger interaction between anchored metal with substrate (Fig. S2). Remarkably, the lowest CT value of Ru atom in group (iii) is related with the smallest electronegativity of coordinating B atom (2.04 for B). Namely, the electron-deficient property of B atom is a significant factor to enhance the single-atomic similarity of Ru and Co, although its efficiency on Co is much weaker compared to the value on Ru. Moreover, the PDOS of single Ru/Co atoms as well as Ru/Co atoms in RuN3-CoN4@G and three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems are calculated to elucidate the enhanced single-atomic similarity (Fig. S3). It can be observed that d orbital splitting peaks of Ru/Co metals occur and get close to the Fermi level in three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems. The PDOS analysis reveal that the Ru in RuN2B-CoN4@G systems possess the higher d-band center (εd in -1.803 ∼ -1.588 eV) compared to the one in RuN3-CoN4@G (-2.225 eV), and is much closer to the value of single Ru atom (-0.205 eV). Similarly, the εd(Co) in three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems (-0.981 ∼ -0.821 eV) is further reduced than the value of RuN3-CoN4@G (-0.760 eV) and approaches the value of single Co atom (-1.335 eV). Hence, the incorporation of B atom indeed strengthens the single-atomic similarity of Ru and Co. On these data, the smallest CT value of Ru atom in RuN2B-CoN4@G probably implies its most prominent anticipation to be stronger adsorption capability towards N2 molecule and higher catalytic activity for urea production. In addition, the substitution of B atom produces the weakest influence of the Ebind of Ru atom in RuN2B moiety [seen in the top of Fig. 1(b)]. To further confirm the feasible advantage of three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems and assess the corresponding structural stability, their ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) were performed during 10 ps simulations at 300 K (Fig. S4). Their structural integrities can be well maintained with only slight distortions (their snapshots at the end were inserted). 2.3 Mechanism of urea electrosynthesis The effective adsorption and the following activity of *N2 intermediate is the essential premise for C-N coupling reaction and the following urea production [40,51]. The *N2 adsorption free energy (∆G(*N2)) on Ru sites of three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems are firstly computed [Fig. 3 (a)]. As expected, three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems exhibit stronger adsorption capability towards N2 molecule due to their more negative ∆G(*N2) values (-0.71, -0.77, -0.83 eV) than that of pristine RuN3-CoN4@G (-0.41 eV) [40]. Besides, the Eads of N2 on Co sites in three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems are also investigated to address the doubt whether the Co would be inclined to serve as N2 affinity site, and the results indicate that the N2 is still adsorbed on Ru site (Fig. S5). Three B-coordination systems can be identified as the most promising candidates for urea electrosynthesis process, thereby the following discussion mainly concentrates on the Ru sites of three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems. Subsequently, their Partial density of states (PDOS) and the charge density difference of adsorbed *N2 on three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems were calculated to elucidate the effective activation of NN triple bond [Fig. 3(b)-3(e)]. Taking the molecular orbitals of the free N2 molecule as reference, the 3σ orbital of the adsorbed *N2 molecule on RuN2B-CoN4@G systems is far from the Fermi level and move towards low-energy region due to an electron-donation process from the 3σ orbital of adsorbed *N2 molecule into the empty d orbital of Ru [Fig. 3(b)-3(d)], which aligns well with that the electron depletion region occurs in the middle of two N atoms [Fig. 3(e)]. Meanwhile, an 2π* orbital obviously shifts to lower-energy region, which can be attributed to an electron-back-donating process that the 2π* orbital of *N2 accepts part of electron density from the occupied d orbital of Ru, which is also agreement with the electron accumulation region appears in the terminal of two N atoms. Moreover, the integrated-crystal orbital Hamilton populations (ICOHP) of N-N is computed to quantitatively describe the NN bond strength [top of Fig. 3(b)-(d)]. Normally, more negative ICOHP value indicates stronger binding interaction. All the computed ICOHP values of N-N interaction in the adsorbed *N2 molecule on three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems are about 50% higher (-10.54, -10.49, -10.50, respectively) than that in the free N2 molecule (-23.02) and slightly higher than that in RuN3-CoN4@G system (-10.46), indicating the effective activation of inert NN triple bond. Therefore, RuN2B-CoN4@G systems can well activate N2 molecule and slightly superior to the pristine RuN3-CoN4@G system, which is beneficial for an effective urea electrosynthesis process. An overview of the reduction pathway to urea production is identified to follow *N2/*CO2 co-adsorption given in Scheme 1 . Three reaction pathways named NCON pathway, CO pathway, COOH pathway are considered according to CO2 reduction process. Three pathways for urea formation all start from the adsorption of N2 and the first protonation step of CO2 (* + N2 + CO2 + H + +e − → *COOH-*N2). The subsequent intermediate of *COOH-*N2 attacked by a proton-electron coupling pair is crucial to distinguish these three reaction pathways. (i) NCON pathway: the OH group of *COOH-*N2 is continued to attacked to form *CO-*N2 intermediate, and then *N2 and *CO coupling into *NCON, eventually forming urea through successive protonation; (ii) CO pathway: the N atom of *CO-*N2 is prior to be protonated to form *CO-*NH2NH2 intermediate, afterwards *CO and*NH2NH2 coupling into urea; (iii) COOH pathway: the N atom of *COOH-*N2 is successively protonated to form *COOH-*NH2NH2, then protonation of *COOH-*NH2NH2 to form *CO-*NH2NH2 and CO coupling with *NH2NH2 to form urea. According to three proposed pathways for urea production, the corresponding Gibbs free energy diagrams on three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems are comprehensively investigated to verify their catalytic performance (Tables S4-S6 and Figs. S8-S10). The optimal reaction pathway (COOH pathway) of urea production and corresponding free energies over three RuN2B-CoN4@G and RuN3-CoN4@G systems are displayed in Fig. 4 (a). Meanwhile, the ∆G values of three main uphill-steps (①: CO2-*N2→*COOH-*N2, ②: *COOH-*N2→*COOH-*NNH, ③: *COOH-*NHNH2→*COOH-*NH2NH2) on three RuN2B-CoN4@G and pristine RuN3-CoN4@G systems are summarized in Fig. 4(b). It is clear to see that the initial hydrogenation step of CO2 activation (CO2-*N2 + H + + e − → *COOH-*N2) in three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems obviously dropped under zero, which is very significant for the final yield of urea. Along with the attacked by proton-electron pairs to the *N intermediates until *CO-*NH2NH2 and the migration of CO to form *NH2CONH2, the maximum ∆G of three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems is 0.78 eV, which is lower than that (0.82 eV) of RuN3-CoN4@G system. The desorption energy of urea (*NH2CONH2→*+NH2CONH2) in three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems is stronger than the RuN3-CoN4@G system, but two values (0.69 eV in RuN2B-CoN4@G-b and 0.75 eV in RuN2B-CoN4@G-c) are lower than the ∆Gmax (0.82 eV) in RuN3-CoN4@G system except the value (0.88 eV) of RuN2B-CoN4@G-c with only 0.06 eV higher than the ∆Gmax in RuN3-CoN4@G system. We also should note the peak Gibbs energies (0.79 eV, 0.76 eV and 0.77 eV) in three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems are much lower than the peak value (1.11 eV) in RuN3-CoN4@G system. To further prove our speculation that the enhanced single-atomic similarity to Ru via B substitution possesses the general advantage for urea formation, the other 9 systems with the lowest-energy structure, including RuN3-CoN3B-e, RuN2C-CoN4-b, RuN3-CoN3C-e, RuN2O-CoN4-c, RuN3-CoN3O-f, RuN2P-CoN4-a, RuN3-CoN3P-d, RuN2S-CoN4-a, RuN3-CoN3S-e, are also screened out to catalyze urea formation (details can be seen in Table S3 and Fig. S6). The Gibbs free energy calculation via three aforementioned production mechanisms are all considered on these 9 systems (Tables S7-S15 and Figs. S11-S19). The computed ∆Gmax values through corresponding optimal reaction pathway are summarized in Fig. 4(c). Excitingly, the ∆Gmax value of our proposed RuN2B-CoN4@G is still lower than those of all these 9 systems. These results further demonstrate that replacing N atom by B atom to construct RuN2B-CoN4@G structure is a feasible strategy to boost the performance of the carbon-based diatomic catalysts for urea production. 2.4 Electrocatalytic selectivity of RuN2B-CoN4@G systems In the electrocatalytic urea synthesis process, the selectivity is also an essential factor to evaluate catalytic performance of three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems. The mainly competitive nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are both considered in this study. For NRR side reaction, the whole Gibbs free energy diagrams and optimized intermediate configurations on three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems are explored (Figs. S20-S22). Meanwhile, the limiting potential (UL) difference (ΔU= ULUrea-ULNH3) between urea main product and NH3 side product is investigated (Table S17). Generally, the more positive value of ΔU indicates the better selectivity towards urea synthesis. It is evidently that NH3 formation can be obviously suppressed on three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems due to positive ΔU values [Fig. 5 (a)]. As for competing HER, Fig. 5(b) shows all adsorption energy of N2 on three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems are lower than those of H + , suggesting N2 molecules predominantly adsorb on Ru sites. Besides, three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems require lower adsorption energies to form *COOH than *H on the Co site when the N2 molecules emerged in neighboring Ru site [Fig. 5(b), Table S18)]. Therefore, it can be deduced that the Ru/Co site of RuN2B-CoN4@G systems will be preferably occupied by N2/COOH over H+, indicating a better selectivity toward urea production. Moreover, the protonation of CO2 to generate *CO is more attractive for its key role in the crucial C-N coupling process. The *COOH with Co-C bond is thus more favorable to form the targeted *CO than the *OCHO with Co-O bond. The computed results indicate that the CO2-*N2 is indeed prone to form *COOH-*N2 on three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems due to lower ΔG [Fig. 5(c)], suggesting their excellent catalytic selectivity. Furthermore, it should be noted that the metal atoms might bind with O/OH/OH2 in realistic electrochemical condition, especially for the protuberant Ru atom, which would impede the adsorption of N2 and CO2 molecules. To address this question, the configurations *O/*OH/*OH2 on Ru and Co metals of three RuN2B-CoN4@G systems are all optimized and the corresponding adsorption free energies are also computed (Figs. S23-S25). It is obviously that Co site would not be occupied because *O/*OH can easily be converted to *OH2, followed by the release of H2O molecules [gray region in Fig. 5(d)]. As for Ru atom, the redox potential is -0.62 V, -0.63 V and -0.62 V on RuCoN6B@G-a/b/c systems, which are lower than corresponding ULUrea, implying the *O/*OH can form free H2O molecule readily at applied electrode potential. Meanwhile the whole urea generation is happened in neutral or weak acidic solution (pH = 6.8), so the *OH concentration is very low. Thus, the surface oxidation in three B-coordination systems can be well escaped. 3 Conclusions In this study, a feasible scheme to further boost urea production is confirmed through the substitution of single electron-deficient B atom in RuN3-CoN4 moiety to form RuN2B-CoN4 moiety in graphene. With first-principle calculations, our data revealed that B atom would dramatically reduce the charge transfer amounts from active Ru site to the substrate, and simultaneously maintain its structural stability. Such single-atomic similarity to free Ru atom endows RuN2B-CoN4@G system with a better adsorption capability for inert N2 molecule and better performance in the following electrocatalytic process, together with the advantages in side reaction of CO2RR/HER and the latent competition caused by *O/*OH. Finally, RuN2B-CoN4@G exhibits superior catalytic performance due to lower or roughly equally limiting potential (-0.69 V, -0.78 V and -0.88 V vs -0.82 V for RuN3-CoN4@G) and the decreased peak Gibbs energy in the whole process (0.76 ∼ 0.79 eV vs 1.11 eV). This work not only verifies the single electro-deficient B atom significance on promoting urea production but also provides a different perspective for rational design of high-performance urea synthesis catalysts. It will stimulate more research on boron-loaded graphene and further investigation on their electrocatalytic performance. 4 Computational methods All calculations in this study were carried out by Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [52]. The Perdaw-Barke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation functional at the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) level was used to compute the electron exchange-correlation energy [53,54]. Projected Augmented Wave (PAW) pseudopotentials were used to describe the core electrons. The DFT-D3 method proposed by Grimme was employed to treat van der Waals interactions [55]. For all the calculations, a vacuum layer of 15 Å thickness in the z direction was introduced to avoid potential interactions between periodic boundaries. Geometry optimizations were performed with a plane-wave cutoff of 500 eV and the Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid of 3 × 3 × 1. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation (AIMD) was carried out for 10 ps with a time step of 1.0 fs, maintaining the temperature at 300 K using a Nose-Hoover thermostat [56]. In addition, the convergence criteria and the energy convergence criteria of geometry optimizations were set to 0.02 eV Å−1 and 10−5 eV, respectively. The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for each elementary reaction was calculated using the Computational Hydrogen Electrode (CHE) model [57–59]. The implicit Poisson-Boltzmann solvation model was used to simulate the solvation effect for all reaction paths to evaluate the accuracy of calculations, in which the dielectric constant of water was taken as 78.4.

        "dc:description": "The potential significance of electrocatalytic urea synthesis as a promising alternative to traditional manufacture is widely recognized. However, the critical hindrance is lack of its highly efficient and robust electrocatalysts until now. Alongside the exploration of novel urea catalysts, it is equally crucial to explore feasible strategies to boost the performance of the identified active sites. In this work, we proposed and demonstrated a modulatory scheme to further promote urea production in Ru-Co dual-metal sites through the substitution of electron-deficient B atom in RuN3 subunit to form RuN2B-CoN4 moiety in graphene. The B-coordinated Ru active site can effectively decrease charge transfer amount from the Ru atom to the substrate. The enhanced single-atomic similarity to free Ru atom results in more negative adsorption energy for N2 molecule and superior catalytic activity/selectivity for urea generation. More significantly, this study provides a new perspective to promote the catalytic performance of the carbon-based diatomic active sites for urea production.",
