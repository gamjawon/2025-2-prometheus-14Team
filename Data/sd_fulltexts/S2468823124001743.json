Simultaneous utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes within a photoredox system enables effective hydrogen (H2) production and organic synthesis, aligning with eco-friendly chemistry principles and current energy challenges. Here, we report the preparation and application of cocatalyst MoS2 decorated CdS (MoS2 CdS) composites for the photoredox-mediated C–N coupling of amines to imines and H2 generation under visible light illumination. The H2 and N-benzylidenebenzylamine yields for the optimal MoS2 CdS are 28.9 and 15.0 times higher than those of bare CdS, respectively. Mechanism studies reveal that the enhanced photocatalytic activity results from the MoS2 acting as an electron sink, which accelerates the separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers. Additionally, the pH(•CH)NH2 intermediates are found to play a pivotal role in the dehydrogenative coupling of benzylamine. Furthermore, the MoS2 CdS composites exhibit universal applicability in the conversion of various aromatic amines into corresponding imines integrated with H2 evolution.

Although progress has been made in photocatalytic H2 production based on semiconductors, most studies still solely concentrate on the half-reaction of H2 evolution [3,4]. Hole scavengers (i.e., triethanolamine and C3H6O3, etc.) are commonly added to photocatalytic systems to improve H2 production efficiency, but this can result in loss of photogenerated holes oxidation capacity and additional cost [5,6]. Instead, replacing the sacrificial agent reaction with selective organic synthesis is able to simultaneously achieve two desirable goals: reducing cost and enabling the coproduction of clean H2 energy and high-value chemicals [7–10]. Imines, a class of organic matters which are containing C=N double bonds, have extensive applications in synthetic chemistry, medicine and agriculture [11,12]. Conventional methods for synthesizing imines typically require expensive catalysts and harsh reaction conditions, such as high temperatures and strong acids, which often result in poor selectivity and difficult purification [13,14]. In contrast, the procedure for achieving imines synthesis through photocatalytic selective oxidation of amines and H2 production possesses milder and greener reaction conditions, thus meeting the requirements of eco-friendly and sustainable chemistry development [15,16]. In this work, we report the application of cocatalyst MoS2 decorated CdS nanorods (MoS2 CdS) for the photoredox-mediated oxidative coupling of amines to imines with concomitant H2 production under visible light illumination. The optimized MoS2 CdS catalyst exhibits remarkably enhanced activities for H2 and N-benzylidenebenzylamine (NBBA) production, which are 28.9 and 15.0 times higher than bare CdS, along with nearly 100% NBBA selectivity. The boosted photocatalytic performance is due to the capability of the cocatalyst MoS2 to transport photogenerated electrons and its active site functionality. Furthermore, in-situ characterization has tracked the dynamical evolution of the reaction intermediates, which highlights the C-centered radical Ph(•CH)NH2, generated through Cα–H cleavage, as a key intermediate in this cooperative photoredox reaction process. We anticipate that this work would inspire the further development of inexpensive and readily available cocatalyst-decorated semiconductor composite catalysts for efficient coproduction of H2 and value-added chemicals under mild conditions. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Chemicals Thiourea (CS(NH2)2), ethylenediamine (C2H8N2), methyl cyanide (MeCN) and ethanol (EtOH) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate ((NH4)2MoS4) was supplied by J&K Scientific Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O), benzylamine (C7H9N, BA) and N-benzylidenebenzylamine (C14H13N, NBBA) were supplied by Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The deionized (DI) water was produced by local laboratory. 2.2 Preparation 2.2.1 Preparation of CdS nanorods (NRs) The preparation of CdS NRs was conducted by a solvothermal process as previously reported [17], which is shown in Supporting Information. 2.2.2 Preparation of MoS2-CDS photocatalyst The xMoS2 CdS (x = 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 wt.%) composites were fabricated using a simple photodeposition approach [18]. Typically, 40 mg of pre-prepared CdS NRs were dispersed in 8 mL of EtOH and 32 mL of DI water, followed by 10 min of sonication after adding different masses of (NH4)2MoS4. The resulting solution was then bubbled with nitrogen (N2) for 20 min and incubated under visible light (λ > 420 nm) in N2 for 30 min. The xMoS2 CdS composites with varying weight ratios of MoS2 (0.5 %, 1 %, 2 % and 3 %) were obtained through filtration, washing and vacuum drying, which were labeled as 0.5MoS2 CdS, 1MoS2 CdS, 2MoS2 CdS and 3MoS2 CdS. 2.3 Photoactivity testing Photoredox catalytic tests for dehydrocoupling BA to NBBA with hydrogen (H2) generation were performed in a double-layer quartz reactor with circulating water. Usually, 10 mg of catalyst, 0.05 mmol of BA and 5 mL of MeCN were sonicated for 5 min. The suspension liquid was then exposed to a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE 300E, Beijing Perfectlight Co., Ltd., 254 mW cm−2 of light intensity, λ > 420 nm) after being air-purified by bubbling through argon (Ar) for 15 min. The photocatalytic procedures were performed under similar conditions in both the control and extension tests. The gaseous product (H2) was quantitatively analyzed by a gas chromatograph with a TCD detector (Shimadzu GC-2014C). The liquid-phase products were filtered and quantitatively analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Shimadzu GC–MS-QP 2010 SE). The conversion of BA, the selectivity of NBBA and the electron/hole consumption ratio in photoredox reactions were determined utilizing the subsequent formula [19,20]: Conversion ( % ) = n 0 − n B A n 0 × 100 % Selectivity ( % ) = 2 n N B B A n 0 − n B A × 100 % R ( e − / h + ) = n H 2 n N B B A Where n0 means the initial moles of BA in the system, nH2, nBA and nNBBA represent the remaining moles of H2, BA and NBBA produced after the reaction, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Preparation and morphology Fig. 1a briefly depicts the preparation process of MoS2 decorated CdS (MoS2 CdS) binary composites. The CdS is prepared following a solvothermal method reported previously [17]. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image displays CdS nanorod structures that are approximately 500 nm in length (Fig. S1a). Then, MoS2 CdS composites are obtained by in situ photodeposition of MoS2 on CdS nanorods (NRs) [18,21]. In Fig. 1b, the MoS2 modified CdS NRs still retain their original morphology. Afterward, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images clearly display that MoS2 decoration causes a change in the surface morphology of CdS from smooth to rough (Figs. 1 c and S1b–c). As shown in Figs. 1 d and S1d, the lattice fringe of 0.34 nm belongs to the (002) crystal plane of CdS, while MoS2 fringes are difficult to observe due to their poor crystallinity [22–24]. Furthermore, the elemental mapping results in Fig. 1e confirm the uniform distribution of the elements of Mo, Cd and S in MoS2 CdS, which are consistent with those obtained from energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (Fig. S2). 3.2 Physicochemical properties analysis To evaluate the elemental compositions and valence states of CdS and MoS2 CdS composites, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been conducted. In Fig. 2a , the XPS survey spectrum of MoS2 CdS shows the detection of all elements (Mo, Cd and S) and a distinct peak of Mo 3d in comparison with the CdS NRs, which proves the successful modification of MoS2 on CdS. The two peaks located at 405.28 eV and 412.08 eV in the Cd 3d spectrum of the MoS2 CdS are attributed to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2, respectively, which are assigned to Cd2+ (Fig. 2b) [25]. The S 2p spectrum shows binding energies of 161.58 eV (S 2p3/2) and 162.78 eV (S 2p1/2), which proves the existence of S2− (Fig. 2c) [26]. Fig. 2d shows the Mo 3d spectrum with two peaks at 228.88 eV and 231.88 eV corresponding to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2, respectively, indicating the presence of Mo4+ [27]. In particular, the characteristic peaks of the CdS elements all shift toward lower binding energies following the MoS2 deposition, suggesting the formation of electronic interactions between MoS2 and CdS (Fig. 2b and c) [28]. The crystalline phase structure of these samples has been further investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. As presented in Fig. 2e, the prominent diffraction characteristic peaks at 2θ degrees of 24.81°, 26.51°, 28.18°, 36.62°, 43.68°, 47.84°, 50.88°, 51.82° and 52.80° can be assigned to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112) and (201) planes of hexagonal CdS (JCPDS No. 41-1049), respectively [29]. Due to the low loading content of MoS2, the XRD patterns of the MoS2 CdS composites show no significant diffraction peaks of MoS2 in contrast to the bare CdS [23], which proves that the MoS2 modification does not damage the crystalline phase structure of CdS [30]. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) has been performed to measure the optical absorption properties of these samples. The results in Fig. 2f indicate that CdS has strong visible absorption, with an absorption edge at approximately 520 nm resulting from its inherent bandgap [22]. In addition, the absorption intensity of MoS2 CdS in the visible region gradually improves with increasing loading amount of MoS2. The above experimental results demonstrate that MoS2 CdS composites have been successfully prepared. 3.3 Photoredox reaction for cooperative hydrogen (H2) production and amines oxidation Subsequently, a photoredox system for C–N coupling of benzylamine (BA) to N-benzylidenebenzylamine (NBBA) and H2 over the prepared samples are performed in the argon (Ar)-saturated acetonitrile (MeCN) solution under the illumination of visible light (Fig. 3a ). As plotted in Fig. 3b, the bare CdS shows poor coproduction of H2 (1.03 μmol) and NBBA (2.02 μmol), while the photocatalytic activity of MoS2 CdS displays a significant enhancement with the increasing loading weight of MoS2. Particularly, 1MoS2 CdS exhibits optimized photoactivity (29.8 μmol of H2 and 30.3 μmol of NBBA), which are 28.9 and 15.0 times higher than those of CdS, respectively; meanwhile, the BA conversion has increased from 13.78 to 60.3%, with the selectivity of NBBA exceeding 99%. Time-yield curves over 1MoS2 CdS demonstrate that the production of NBBA reaches 49.7 μmol after 4 h of irradiation, which further supports the superior efficiency of the binary composite (Fig. 3c). Notably, according to the yields of H2 and NBBA, the electron/hole consumption ratio is approximately 1.0, which demonstrates the reaction proceeds stoichiometrically [31]. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of NBBA coincides with the DRS spectrum of MoS2 CdS (Fig. 3d). Afterward, we have carried out recycle tests to evaluate the stability of 1MoS2 CdS. As depicted in Fig. 3e, the 1MoS2 CdS binary catalyst demonstrates minimal loss of photoactivity even after four cycles, indicating its exceptional stability. In addition, after 2 h of irradiation, the Cd2+ leaching concentration of 1MoS2 CdS is significantly reduced compared to that of blank CdS (2.44 mg gcatalyst −1 of CdS NRs and 1.18 mg gcatalyst −1 of 1MoS2 CdS), which signifies that the MoS2 cocatalyst can substantially constrain photocorrosion of CdS (Table S1) [32,33]. Moreover, the XRD patterns and XPS spectra demonstrate that the 1MoS2 CdS used in the experiments exhibits no significant differences when compared to the fresh one, which further confirms the exceptional stability of the 1MoS2 CdS (Figs. S3 and S4). In order to evaluate the versatility of this photoredox system, we have then investigated the photocatalytic activity of amines with different substituents. As seen in Figs. 4 and S5–S7, the corresponding imines are generated with satisfactory yields and selectivity after 3 h of irradiation. However, owing to substituent distinctions and spatial site resistance, the conversions of different amines vary greatly (33–68%). The conversions of monosubstituted amines follow the order of electron-donating groups over electron-withdrawing groups, with para-substitution being favored over meta-substitution and ortho-substitution (2b–2 h), which is consistent with earlier researches [10,34]. Compared with monosubstituted amines, the reaction rate of disubstituted amines is reduced (2i–2j) [23]. It is notable that the catalyst also exhibits the good activity for amines that contain heteroatoms, which further illustrates the desirable universality of the current photoredox system (2k–2l). 3.4 Mechanism insight for photoredox dual reaction Subsequently, a series of electrochemical and photochemical experiments have been conducted to investigate the cause of the improved activity over the 1MoS2 CdS compared to bare CdS [35]. The polarization curves of 1MoS2 CdS and CdS reveal that the introduction of the MoS2 cocatalyst enhances the charge transfer rate and reduces the overpotential for H2 evolution (Fig. 5a ) [18]. In Fig. 5b, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plot of 1MoS2 CdS features a smaller radius than that of CdS, suggesting a higher charge transfer efficiency over 1MoS2 CdS than that over CdS [36], which is consistent with cyclic voltammogram (CV) results (Fig. 5c) [37]. Additionally, the photocurrent density of the 1MoS2 CdS exceeds that of the CdS when exposed to intermittent light, suggesting that the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers is effectively prevented ( Fig. 5d) [38]. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra display similar emission peaks at 550 nm for both samples, while the PL intensity of the 1MoS2 CdS is significantly attenuated compared to that of CdS (Fig. 5e). Moreover, as depicted in Fig. 5f and Table S2, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) results indicate that the emission lifetime of the 1MoS2 CdS (3.98 ns) is shorter than that of the CdS (6.72 ns), revealing the enhanced charge transfer over 1MoS2 CdS composite [23]. Therefore, the aforementioned results suggest that the introduction of MoS2 is able to enhance the separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers on the surface of semiconductor, leading to the enhanced photocatalytic activity for BA conversion and H2 generation. To explore the reaction mechanism of cooperative photoredox coupling of NBBA formation with H2 production over 1MoS2 CdS, we have first assessed the band structure of CdS and the oxidation potential of BA. Based on the Tauc plot in Fig. S8a, the band gap (Eg) of CdS is calculated to be 2.40 eV. The valence band (VB)-XPS technique is used to obtain the VB information of CdS (Fig. S8b). The VB potential (EVB, XPS) of CdS is 2.04 eV, so the EVB of the corresponding standard hydrogen electrode (EVB) is calculated to be 1.80 V [39]. Accordingly, the conduction band (CB) potential (ECB) of CdS is computed as −0.60 V (EVB = ECB + Eg) [20]. The results indicate that the ECB of CdS is more negative than the energy level of H +/H2 (−0.41 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)), while EVB of CdS has a more positive energy level than that of BA/BA•+ (0.98 V vs. NHE, Fig. S9). Therefore, it is suggested that photooxidation of BA to NBBA coupled with photoreduction of H2 evolution is feasible in thermodynamics (Fig. 6a ) [31]. Moreover, according to previous work of our group, the Fermi energy level (Ef) of MoS2 has been measured to be approximately −0.22 V, which can transport electrons from the CB of CdS [18]. Then, a series of control and quenching experiments have been carried out (Fig. 6b). No products can be detected without light or catalyst, indicating that this reaction is a photo-driven catalytic process. When the hole scavenger (triethanolamine, TEOA) and the electron trapping agent (carbon tetrachloride, CCl4) are added to the system, the H2 production and NBBA formation are significantly reduced, respectively, revealing that the joint involvement of photogenerated holes and electrons in the reaction procedure [40]. In addition, the inclusion of the radical trapping agent (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolin-N-oxide, DMPO) can significantly reduce the generation of NBBA, which suggests that NBBA is formed via radical intermediates [41]. To determine the type of reaction intermediates, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies have been executed to monitor radical intermediates formed in photocatalytic reactions using DMPO as a spin-trapping agent. Fig. 6c shows that both CdS and 1MoS2 CdS exhibit six similar signal peaks when exposed to visible light, while there are almost no signals in darkness, indicating the production of Ph(•CH)NH2 (αN = 15.71 and αH = 22.16, associated with nitrogen hyperfine cleavage and hydrogen hyperfine cleavage of nitrogen oxide nitrogen) [12]. It is worth noting that the 1MoS2 CdS has a stronger peak intensity than that of CdS, indicating that MoS2 can promote the cleavage of Cα‒H bond and the formation of Ph(•CH)NH2 intermediates. Furthermore, the in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy technique has been performed to reveal the dynamical changes of BA and NBBA over 1MoS2 CdS throughout the reaction. As illustrated in Fig. 6d, the weak peaks at 3270 and 3320 cm−1 identify the N‒H bond stretching vibration on BA [42]. The new peak at 1644 cm−1 confirms the appearance of imines, corresponding to the C=N bond on the NBBA [43]. Given the above discussion, we have proposed a speculated mechanism for C‒N coupling of BA to NBBA and H2 evolution on MoS2 CdS composites in Fig. 7 . The photogenerated charge carriers (electrons and holes) are generated due to the excitation of CdS component in the composites under visible light illumination. The MoS2 cocatalyst functions as an electron sink to accept and localize the photogenerated electrons from the CB of CdS [23], thus accelerating the separation and migration efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers [44]. The surface-absorbed BA on the catalyst is first attacked by the photogenerated holes in the VB of CdS, resulting in the formation of PhCH2NH2 •+ cation. Then, the C-centered radical pH(•CH)NH2 is generated by the cleavage of the Cα‒H bond. Subsequently, the pH(•CH)NH2 intermediates are further dehydrogenated to create N-Benzylideneamine (PhCHNH) [31]. Finally, the nucleophilic PhCHNH undergoes an addition-elimination reaction with another BA to yield NBBA by releasing an NH3 molecule [45,46]. Meanwhile, the photogenerated electrons interact with H + that are separated from the organic substrate and eventually produce H2, thus completing the entire photocatalytic reaction. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, we report the photoredox-mediated performance for the C‒N coupling of amines to imines with simultaneous H2 production over MoS2 modified CdS nanorods (MoS2 CdS) binary composites. Compared to blank CdS, the optimal MoS2 CdS presents significantly improved photocatalytic activity for coproduction of NBBA and H2, as well as high NBBA selectivity (>99 %). The mechanism analysis emphasizes that the MoS2 cocatalyst as an electron transfer can accelerate the separation and movement of photogenerated charge carriers in CdS, thus improving the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the C-centered radical (pH(•CH)NH2) is a critical intermediate in the photocatalytic pathway formed by Cα‒H bond cleavage. It is expected that this work would offer valuable insights into the development of low-cost and easily accessible cocatalyst-decorated semiconductor composite photocatalysts for the efficient coproduction of clean solar fuels and value-added chemicals.

        "dc:description": "Simultaneous utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes within a photoredox system enables effective hydrogen (H2) production and organic synthesis, aligning with eco-friendly chemistry principles and current energy challenges. Here, we report the preparation and application of cocatalyst MoS2 decorated CdS (MoS2 CdS) composites for the photoredox-mediated C–N coupling of amines to imines and H2 generation under visible light illumination. The H2 and N-benzylidenebenzylamine yields for the optimal MoS2 CdS are 28.9 and 15.0 times higher than those of bare CdS, respectively. Mechanism studies reveal that the enhanced photocatalytic activity results from the MoS2 acting as an electron sink, which accelerates the separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers. Additionally, the pH(•CH)NH2 intermediates are found to play a pivotal role in the dehydrogenative coupling of benzylamine. Furthermore, the MoS2 CdS composites exhibit universal applicability in the conversion of various aromatic amines into corresponding imines integrated with H2 evolution.",
