Graphical abstract The synthesis of the catalysts Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34), H-Fe-silicalite-1(34) and Na-Fe-silicalite-1(68) has been achieved by using the sol-gel method to incorporate the Fe as a T-atom in the zeolite framework (the values in brackets refer to Si/Fe molar ratios). Techniques that include FT-IR, XRD, SEM, TEM, ICP-OES, XRF, BET, TPR and TPD were used to characterize the catalysts. The XRD results show that only the ZSM-5 phase was present in all the synthesized catalysts. In addition, the TPR data showed a single peak assignable to Fe(III) species at 809.3, 806.5, and 777.9°C for Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34), H-Fe-silicalite-1(34) and Na-Fe-silicalite-1(68) respectively. The oxidation of octane over Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34) using H2O2 as an oxidant showed a direct dependence of conversion on temperature such that conversions of 9.6, 16.1 and 18% were recorded at 40, 60 and 80°C respectively. However, an inverse relationship was observed for the selectivity to terminal products (1-octanol and octanal). Selectivities of 30, 25 and 24% were recorded at 40, 60 and 80°C respectively. The H-Fe-silicalite-1(34) and Na-Fe-silicalite-1(68) catalysts were further tested at 80°C with the results showing that the H-Fe-silicalite-1(34) attained a terminal product selectivity of 26% at 19.8% conversion, while Na-Fe-silicalite-1(68) showed 27% selectivity to terminal products at 13.7% conversion. Only linear C8 products were observed under the conducted reaction conditions. Keywords Iron silicalites Hydrogen peroxide n-Octane Oxidation Oxygenates 1 Introduction Paraffins are abundant and relatively cheap. However, due to their relative inertness, activating the paraffinic CH bonds to yield value-added useful chemicals such as oxygenates usually requires the use of harsh reaction conditions (high temperature and pressure) [1]. Many studies have been conducted in an effort to overcome these limitations [2–6]. Despite all the attempts, the ability to design a catalytic system for the oxidation of paraffins under mild conditions is still a major challenge in the field of catalysis [7,8]. There has been a steady increase in the number of gas (and coal) to liquids plants worldwide which will significantly increase the supply of medium to long chain linear paraffins [9], consequently necessitating the need for processes to convert these to valuable products, such as oxygenates. The low value of linear paraffins, coupled with increasing environmental awareness and stricter environmental legislation from governments across the world, implies that the development of a catalyst system capable of utilising paraffins with environmentally friendly oxidants like molecular O2 and H2O2 is of paramount importance [10,11]. The currently available catalytic processes give low selectivity to the desired product(s) or at best only achieve very low paraffin conversions [12]. The robust catalytic activity of the cytochrome P450 enzymes are well documented for their ability to activate organic molecules in oxidation reactions using the O2 molecule under mild conditions [13–15]. The key feature of the enzymes is their ability to achieve a very high selectivity to terminal products in the oxidation of alkanes and this has inspired a lot of biomimetic research across the world [16]. The well-structured zeolite materials are commonly used as inorganic matrices for the incorporation of active sites that control selectivity in catalysis as methods of mimicking the enzymatic environment. In this regards, Zhang et al. have reported a selectivity of 21% to terminal products using Fe/Pd zeolite in the oxidation of n-octane using an O2-H2 mixture. However, the key drawback was that products elimination from the zeolite pores was only possible after dissolution of the entire zeolite structure [17]. Also good selectivity was reported by Herron where a selectivity of 45% to terminal products was achieved in the oxidation of n-octane over Fe-ZSM-5 using H2O2 as an oxidant. In Herron’s study, the extra framework iron substitution method was used, however leaching test studies were not reported [18]. These, however, are important since leaching is a major drawback. Furthermore, a selectivity of 65.5% to terminal products in the oxidation of n-hexane using MnAlPO-18 (and 61.3% using CoAlPO-18) with air as oxidant has been reported [19–21]. However, conversions were very low. TS-1 is well known as an oxidative catalyst, with the limitation of not activating the C-1 position of unsaturated hydrocarbons [22]. To help address some of the issues associated with the activation of paraffins, we hereby present a report on the oxidation of octane to terminal products using H2O2 as an environmentally benign oxidant. For this study, Fe-silicalite-1 type material was prepared, since Fe has been shown to be a good oxidative metal [23–25] and incorporating it within the MFI matrix, which is good for shape selective catalysis, offered the possibility of achieving selective octane activation. The Na-Fe-silicalite-1 and H-Fe-silicalite-1 catalysts were prepared using the sol-gel method in order to incorporate iron atoms within the zeolite framework. The synthesized catalysts were tested in the oxidation of n-octane at 40, 60 and 80°C using H2O2 in acetonitrile. The effect of Si/Fe ratios of 34 and 68 (atomic molar ratios) was also investigated with the aim of influencing catalyst selectivity to terminal products. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst synthesis 2.1.1 Materials All materials purchased were used as supplied: sodium silicate (Sigma-Aldrich), colloidal silica Ludox 40 (Sigma-Aldrich), iron(III)nitrate nonahydrate (Aldrich), sodium hydroxide (Merck), tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPA, Merck), perchloric acid 70% (Merck), sodium chloride (Associated Chemical Enterprises), hydrochloric acid (Associated Chemical Enterprises), hydroxylamine (Merck), potassium hydroxide (Merck), ammonium hydroxide (Merck), acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich), octane (Fluka), hydrogen peroxide (Associated Chemical Enterprises), and hydrofluoric acid (Riedel-de Haën). The Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34) was synthesised using the sol-gel method [26]. Iron nitrate (1.57g) was dissolved in de-ionized water (100ml) which was acidified by three drops of perchloric acid in a 500ml Teflon beaker, to maintain a sufficient pH to keep iron in the Fe3+ oxidation state, followed by addition of perchloric acid (3.5ml) (solution 1). In a second 500ml Teflon beaker, 11.5ml of sodium silicate solution was added to 141ml of de-ionized water (solution 2). Both solutions were kept in a refrigerator overnight. While still cold, solution 2 was added drop wise into solution 1 under vigorous stirring until pH 4.5 (using pH paper). Then 14.8ml of colloidal silica was added into the remainder of solution 2 which has then added to solution 1. To the slurry that formed was added 2g sodium chloride and 6.7g TPA. The pH of the resultant creamy slurry was 10.5. The slurry was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and allowed to crystallize in a Parr reactor at 160°C for 24h without agitation. After crystallization, solids were filtered, washed with hot water and dried at 110°C from which Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34) was obtained. The procedure is the same for the synthesis of Na-Fe-silicalite-1(68) except that 0.81g of iron nitrate was used. The H-Fe-Silicalite-1(34) was obtained by adding Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34) into 0.1M ammonium nitrate and allowing the mixture to stand overnight. The product was then filtered, dried and calcined at 550°C under air [27]. All synthesised catalysts were calcined in the following manner; firstly, the temperature was raised to 200°C at 10°C/min and held for 2h, then raised to 300°C at the same rate and held for 2h and finally raised to 550°C at the same rate and held for 4h under air. 2.2 Characterisation Fourier Transform-Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy data was obtained within the range of 4000–400cm−1 using a Nicolet 400D spectrophotometer. The FT-IR samples were prepared by mixing the sample with dried KBr and evacuating to prevent moisturisation. The samples were then pressed to pellets and run immediately. Powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Philips PW 1730/10 diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation, equipped with a long line focus operating with amperage of 20mA and voltage of 40kV. Data was collected in the range of 2–90° (2θ). Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) data was obtained using a Philips XL30 ESEM at 20kV operating at a low vacuum mode of 1Torr. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) images were obtained from a JEOL JEM 1010. Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) data was collected on a PerkinElmer (Optima 5300 DV) instrument. Samples were digested in hydroflouric acid and the analyses were done in triplicate. The X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) Spectroscopy was performed on a PW 1404 X-Ray Fluorescence instrument equipped with a flow counter detector. Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area measurements were obtained using a Micromeritics Gemini instrument. The Hydrogen Temperature Progammed Reduction H2-TPR and Ammonia Temperature Programmed Desorption (NH3-TPD) were performed on a Micromeritics Autochem II chemisorption analyzer equipped with a TCD detector using 5% H2/He for TPR and 5% NH3/He for TPD. The H2-TPR data was collected between 50 and 900°C (10°Cmin−1) in a flow of 5% (v/v) at 15mlmin−1. Prior to the NH3 TPD, the samples were pre-treated in He flow at 700°C for 2h followed by saturation of the catalyst surface with NH3 at 50°C. Subsequently NH3 desorption profiles were recorded between 50 and 700°C at a ramping rate of 5Cmin−1. 2.3 Catalyst testing (n-octane) All the reactions were performed under nitrogen. In a typical test run, 13ml of acetonitrile was added into a two-neck round bottomed flask (100ml) fitted with a stopper and a condensor. This was followed by the sequential addition of 7mmol of octane, 2.3mmol of H2O2 (30wt%) which was added dropwise into the reaction mixture and 0.22g catalyst. The reactions were conducted at 40, 60 and 80°C for 8h. The products were analysed by Perkin Elmer Auto System GC equipped with a Flame Ionisation Detector using a Pona 50×0.20mm×0.5μm column. The residual H2O2 was determined by titrating 1ml of the reaction solution acidified with 6M H2SO4 with 0.1M KMnO4. Chlorobenzene was used as an internal standand and the carbon balance was found to be ±98% in all cases. Each reaction was repeated twice. The percentage deviation in the data was ±2%. 2.4 Oxidation of n-octane in the presence of cyclohexane The oxidation of n-octane with the addition of cyclohexane was conducted following the procedure of Herron [18]. Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34) 0.2g was added into 7mmol octane, 5mmol cyclohexane and 2.3mmol of H2O2 (30wt%) which was added dropwise into the reaction mixture, with 1μl chlorobenzene as an internal standard, in a 5ml round bottomed flask without a solvent. The reactions were conducted at room temperature and 80°C. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterisation The FT-IR results (spectra in the Supplementary information section) of the functionalised Fe-Silicalite-1 catalysts are presented in Table 1 . The specta show peaks at 550cm−1 and 1200cm−1 associated with the ZSM-5 framework structure [28]. The peak at 796cm−1, which is assigned to FeOSi of the ZSM-5 framework, and the peak at 1100cm−1, which is due to Si-O stretching, are diagnostic. The spectum of H-Fe-Silicalite-1(34) shows an extra peak at 3500cm−1, which is due to SiOH or FeOH stretching [28]. The FT-IR pattern of Na-Fe-silicalite-1(68) is essentially similar to that of Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34), consistent with the fact that in this instance the infrared analysis is used qualitatively rather than as a quantitative technique. The powder XRD diffractograms (Fig. 1 ) of all the catalysts, Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34), H-Fe-silicalite-1(34) and Na-Fe-silicalite-1(68) show the ZSM-5 pattern (similar to the reference pattern shown in the supplemental information section). The intensity of the peaks confirmed that the catalysts are crystalline in nature and no Fe haematite phase lines at 38.7 and 41.6° 2θ values [29] are observed. The SEM image of the Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34) catalyst, Fig. 2 , shows that the bulk of the catalyst is characterised by having a predominantly uniform spherical morphology. This observation is further complimented by the TEM image presented in Fig. 3 for the Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34) catalyst in which the spherical outline is clearly evident with crystals ranging between 10 and 14μm in diameter. All the synthesised catalysts showed this characteristic spherical pattern and fall within this size range. In addition, the HR-TEM analysis (Fig. 4 ) shows fringe lines which reflect the crystalline structure of the ZSM-5 phase. In order to study the effects of varying the Si/Fe ratio on catalytic performance, the amount of iron was varied during the synthesis to yield catalysts containing 2.01 and 1.15wt% Fe, as obtained by XRF analysis. Hence, Si/Fe molar ratios of 34 and 68 were obtained as shown in Table 1. The BET surface area measurement (Table 2 ) results show 314, 343 and 365m2/g for Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34), H-Fe-silicalite-1(34) and Na-Fe-silicalite-1(68) respectively, thus no significant difference is observed between the surface measurements. Hydrogen-TPR results are also shown in Table 2, where a single peak was observed for all the catalysts. An equal amount of hydrogen (H2/Fe molar ratio=0.4) was required for the reduction of Fe in both the Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34) and the H-Fe-silicalite-1(34) catalysts, at the same temperatures (809°C for the former as compared to a 807°C for the latter), as expected. For Na-Fe-silicalite-1(68), a H2/Fe molar ratio of 0.7 was required to reduce the Fe at a reduction temperature of 778°C. The lone peak observed for all the catalysts is associated with Fe3+ incorporated within the silicalite-1 framework. It is known that Fe3+ is reduced at temperatures above 600°C in general [30]. The NH3-TPD results show two peaks for all catalysts, one in the low temperature region (159–194°C) and the second peak in the relatively high temperature region (329–346°C) as shown in Table 2. The high temperature region results are associated with desorption of NH3 from the strong Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, while the low temperature region is associated with the desorption of NH3 from the weak Brønsted and Lewis acid sites [31]. The H-Fe-silicalite-1 has higher acidity as shown in Table 2 due to the presence of the protons as counter ions. 3.2 Catalyst testing With the synthesised catalysts fully characterised, catalysts Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34), H-Fe-Silicalite-1(34) and Na-Fe-silicalite-1(68) were tested for activity in the conversion of n-octane to oxygenates using H2O2 as oxidant. The ratio of n-octane to H2O2 was kept at 3:1 to limit the possible over oxidation. These catalysts were chosen to investigate the effect of varying the cation in the zeolite and the effects of Si/Fe ratio towards the selectivity to terminal oxygenate products. Data showing the overall conversion of octane (Fig. 5 ) to oxygenates shows a gradual increase in conversion with time that is temperature dependent. The highest conversion of 18% was obtained at a reaction temperature of 80°C after 2h. The generally low conversions may be attributed to the rate of diffusion of products from the ZSM-5 structure channels and pores, which are believed to be the limiting factor. The Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34) was chosen to investigate the effects of temperature on the conversion of octane at 40, 60 and 80°C. The highest conversion was observed at 80°C, which was also the boiling point of the mixture under reaction conditions, therefore this was considered as the maximum temperature. Generally, the overall conversion of octane to oxygenates increases with temperature and is directly related to reaction time. The highest conversion of 18% was observed at 80°C after 2h, conversion then levels off with time, probably due to saturation of products within the zeolite channels [32]. It was observed that conversions for all tested reactions levelled off after 8h. Only C8 products were obtained, namely octanol and octanones, with no CO/CO2 or shorter (cracked) hydrocarbons observed. The octanone(s)/octanol(s) ratio results using the Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34) catalyst (Table 3 ) showed that at 40°C the reaction produced more octanols during the first hour of reaction (1.3 ratio). However, after six hours of reaction, more octanones were produced, most probalbly due to further oxidation of the octanols. This suggests that the octanols are primary products and they are further oxidised to octanones over time. This is further supported by the observation that octanal and 2-octanone were produced when 1-octanol and 2-octanol were oxidised under identical conditions. At reaction temperatures of 60 and 80°C, octanones production was dominant throughout. However, less octanones were obtained at 80°C (1.4 ratio) than at 60°C reaction temperature, likely, due to the H2O2 decomposition at 80°C, which is higher than the decomposition of H2O2 at 60°C Comparing the selectivity to terminal products (Figs. 6–8 ); the reaction at 40°C showed a better selectivity of 30% to terminal products, while the reactions at 60 and 80°C gave selectivities of 25% and 24% respectively. Octanal was the dominant product in these reactions and was observed to increase with time for the reactions conducted at 40 and 60°C. Since conversion was highest at 80°C, this temperature was used to conduct further tests to establish the scope of the catalytic process for the H-Fe-silicalite-1(34) and Na-Fe-silicalite-1(68) catalysts. The conversion and selectivities of the catalysts were compared as shown in Table 4 . It was observed that the Na-Fe-silicalite-1(68) showed better selectivity (28%) to terminal products compared to Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34) at a conversion of 13.7%. The H-Fe-silicalite-1(34) showed 26% selectivity to terminal products at a conversion of 19.8%. The conversion and the selectivity to terminal products of H-Fe-silicalite-1(34) were thus found to be higher than those over Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34) (Table 4). The difference in activities can be attributed to the different ionic sizes of H and Na which influence the pore size. It also can be argued that the hydrophobic nature of Na might be responsible for lower conversion observed for the Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34) catatlyst. Furthermore, the difference in activity can be attributed to the acidic nature of H-Fe-silicalite-1(34) as the TPD analysis showed that this material has higher acidity. Conversion over Na-Fe-silicalite-1(68) was lower with higher selectivity to terminal products, which is due to fewer active sites due to a lower iron content. The conversion of H2O2 over these Fe-silicalite-1 systems was found to be between 21 and 24%, corresponding to H2O2 efficiency of between 98 and 98.9%. The influence of oxidant concentration was investigated. This was done by increasing the amount of H2O2 in order to achieve an octane/H2O2 ratio of 1.5 (Table 5 ). Under similar reaction conditions as before, only a marginal increase in conversion was observed, with the highest increase of 2.2% recorded for Na-Fe-silicalite-1(68). Due to an increase in the relative amount of oxidant a significant change in octanone(s)/octanol(s) ratio was observed, with higher amounts of octanones observed at the higher H2O2 concentration used, as shown in Table 5, for all the catalysts. The highest relative increase in octanones was for Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34). These results suggest again that the catalyst first produces octanols and then octanones. This was confirmed by 6% conversion of 1-octanol to octanal and 4% conversion of 2-octanol to 2-octanone under similar oxidation reaction conditions after 8h. However, when radical scavengers like TEMPO (2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl) and DPPH (1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) were used in conjunction with Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34), the selectivity to terminal products improved by only 1% at the conversion of 17.8%. This suggests that there is only a minor contribution to the OH radical’s reaction outside of the silicalite-1 channel. The reaction mechanism is believed to follow the free radical mechanism (within the channels) according to equations 1 and 2 to produce alcohols when the peroxide is used [33]. (1) Fe3+ +H2O2 →Fe2+ +HOO +H+ (2) Fe2+ +H2O2 →Fe2+ +2OH (3) OH +R−H→R−OH+H Fig. 9 shows the reaction products distribution over the Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34) catalyst, with octanal, 2-octanol and 2-octanone obtained in 19.8%, 19.4 and 18.9% selectivities. All other products had selectivities lower than 15%. The H-Fe-silicalite-1(34) and Na-Fe-silicalite-1(68) materials exibited a similar trend of product selectivity. No cracking products were observed for any catalysts under any conditions. The catalyst Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34) was used to investigate catalyst stability at the optimum temperature of 80°C. Three cycles were conducted using the same catalyst. No change in ZSM-5 structure was observed for the used catalyst as confirmed by XRD, FT-IR and SEM techniques. It was observed that the catalyst maintained its conversion (18%) with no change in product distribution, implying that the Fe-silicalite-1 is efficiently recyclable. Furthermore, leaching tests were performed at 60 and 80°C using Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34). The solution was clear after filtering off the catalyst after 1h of reaction (hot filtration). The solution was stirred a further 7h at this temperature and there was no further conversion observed. Furthermore, the ICP analysis of the reaction solution showed that there was no Fe species present in the solution. These findings suggest that there was no leaching of Fe into the solution and that the reactions are completely heterogeneous. 3.3 Oxidation of n-octane in the presence of cyclohexane Cyclohexane was added to the reaction mixture in order to create secondary carbon competition between the internal carbons in octane and C2 in cyclohexane. This was done with the aim of lowering the C2 selectivity in n-octane which should result in increasing the C1 selectivity in n-octane. Indeed, Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34) showed good selectivity of 46.5% to terminal products at room temperature. However, because both octane and cyclohexane are believed to be able to access the channels and the cavities of the ZSM-5 structure, the cyclohexane was found to be the preferred oxidised substrate by a factor of 300:1 to n-octane. Similar results were also obtained at 80°C with the factor of cyclohexane oxidation being increased to 400:1. The limitation of this reaction was found to be the conversion of n-octane, which was less than 1%. The amount of H2O2 was then increased to 4.6 and 9.2mmol in attempts to increase the conversion of n-octane. Conversion of cyclohexane was found to increase with the increase in the H2O2 amount, while the conversion of n-octane remained the same. 4 Conclusions Analysis using XRD and TPR showed that only one species of iron, in the form of Fe3+ was present in all the synthesised catalysts. In catalytic reactions with n-octane and H2O2, a direct correlation was established between temperature and conversion with the highest conversion of 18% observed at 80°C. However, the correlation between catalyst selectivity and temperature was an inverse relationship, with the highest selectivity of 30% to terminal products achieved at 40°C. The results reveal a 4% improvement in selectivity to terminal products by changing the Si/Fe ratio from 34 to 68. Addition of cyclohexane in the feed improves terminal selectivity at the expense of octane conversion, while using H2O2 at concentrations below stoichiometric give high H2O2 efficiencies (98–99%). Incorporation of Fe within the zeolite framework thus yields selective catalysts for the mild oxidation of n-octane to octanols, octanones and octanal with good selectivities to terminal products, especially octanal.

        "dc:description": "The synthesis of the catalysts Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34), H-Fe-silicalite-1(34) and Na-Fe-silicalite-1(68) has been achieved by using the sol-gel method to incorporate the Fe as a T-atom in the zeolite framework (the values in brackets refer to Si/Fe molar ratios). Techniques that include FT-IR, XRD, SEM, TEM, ICP-OES, XRF, BET, TPR and TPD were used to characterize the catalysts. The XRD results show that only the ZSM-5 phase was present in all the synthesized catalysts. In addition, the TPR data showed a single peak assignable to Fe(III) species at 809.3, 806.5, and 777.9°C for Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34), H-Fe-silicalite-1(34) and Na-Fe-silicalite-1(68) respectively. The oxidation of octane over Na-Fe-silicalite-1(34) using H2O2 as an oxidant showed a direct dependence of conversion on temperature such that conversions of 9.6, 16.1 and 18% were recorded at 40, 60 and 80°C respectively. However, an inverse relationship was observed for the selectivity to terminal products (1-octanol and octanal). Selectivities of 30, 25 and 24% were recorded at 40, 60 and 80°C respectively. The H-Fe-silicalite-1(34) and Na-Fe-silicalite-1(68) catalysts were further tested at 80°C with the results showing that the H-Fe-silicalite-1(34) attained a terminal product selectivity of 26% at 19.8% conversion, while Na-Fe-silicalite-1(68) showed 27% selectivity to terminal products at 13.7% conversion. Only linear C8 products were observed under the conducted reaction conditions.",
