My guest editor Robert J. Davis and I are academic relatives. That is, we have an academic lineage in common; both of us are descendent from Sir Hugh Taylor at Princeton, respectively, via Robert L. Burwell, Jr. and Michel Boudart, who were graduate students with Sir Hugh Taylor at Princeton. Burwell earned his Ph.D. in 1936 and Boudart in 1950, and respectively, GLH in 1966 at Northwestern and RJD in 1989 at Stanford. Thus, our hope is that together we combine older/outsider and younger/insider insight on the development of the Boudart school 1 1 “Today, we continue to benefit from Michel’s attention to the elementary steps in the catalytic process, his insistence that data be normalized as the turnover frequency occurring on the active catalytic site, the consideration of microkinetic behavior at the surface, and the influence of rate limiting steps. It is the ‘Boudart School’ of catalytic thought.” As defined in The Extraordinary Life Of Michel Boudart by Ricardo B Levy, see following editorial. of catalysis, as well as a shared enthusiasm for this project. Robert is my co-editor, but he has generously allowed me to put on my senior editor hat to write the foreword. In the above Editorial Introduction to the online Virtual Special Issue, we have already commented on Ricardo Levy’s personal perspective, as well as Gerhard Ertl’s scientific perspective, that is the lead Perspective of the section on Reaction Kinetics. While Ricardo has given an outline of the history of Catalytica, Ralph Dalla Betta's Perspective illustrates Michel’s leadership in the practical development of combustion catalysts, “[a] scientific odyssey.” We think the three contributions of Levy, Della Betta and Ertl give us a glimpse of the great man and of his extraordinary contributions to our fundamental understanding of catalytic science over half of the 20th century. We have consulted with several Journal of Catalysis editors and students of Boudart about potential candidates as invited authors that would include Boudart students, students of Boudart students, and collegial friends. The large number of outstanding students is part of the Boudart legacy, so we are pleased that the final list of authors is comprised of 14 Boudart students, 2 2 Davis, R., Delgass, Della Betta, Dumesic, Ichikawa, Iglesia, Lee, Levy, Madix, Oyama, Ribeiro, Ryoo, Valença, and Weber. 9 students of Boudart students, 3 3 Barteau, Bhan, Bond, Choi, Gounder, Huber, Noh, Román-Leshkov, and Wachs. and 20 friends. 4 4 Bell, Campbell, Chen, Christopher, Chin, Davis, M., Ertl, Flaherty, Jentoft, Lercher, Linic, Marin, Olsbye, Paolucci, Resasco, Rimer, Roldán Cuenya, Schneider, Weckhuysen, and Zaera. We note that two of these authors, Mark Davis and Guy Marin, have done post-doctorate research in Boudart’s laboratory. Moreover, there are co-authors of the 43 manuscripts that add several academic grandchildren of Boudart as well. 5 5 De la Torre, Kwon, Sarazen, Schwartz and Shangguang. We originally thought to give an overview of content, but that seems redundant with respect to a browse through the content listing of our six sections, four of which map onto Boudart’s interests rather directly and the other two deal with reaction kinetics in the liquid phase and using theory to understand catalysis that are more 21st century. This is not to say the latter two sections were not touched on in his research. For example, Boudart published a series of studies of Pt and Pd catalysts, initially comparing the gas and liquid phases (cyclohexane solvent) and then extended the study comparing several different organic solvents. However, we do choose to mention two Perspectives to call attention to other attributes of Boudart’s tutorial mentoring of his colleagues, as well as his students. The first of these is the Weber Perspective on turnover rates that is central to the Boudart legacy, but as Boudart would have appreciated, Weber does not overlook the history of the evolution of turnover rates. He notes that Boudart originally quantified surface/bulk ratio of a metal as “dispersion” followed by “turnover number” borrowed from enzyme catalysis, and that we now use “turnover rate.” More importantly, Weber recognizes that the concept itself had a borrowed history (as most science does), “Following the pioneering measurements of metallic surface area by Boreskov [6], Boudart devised the second term [dispersion] to describe the surface/bulk ratio of the metal in supported metal catalysts.” 6 6 Reference [6[ is G. K. Boreskov, A.P. Karnaukhov, The adsorption method of measurement of the surface of platinum in platinized silica gels, Zh. Fiz. Khim 26 (1952) 1814–1823. A second publication of G. K. Boreskov entitled “Quantitative Characterization of Catalytic Activity,” Kinetics and Catalysis (Published by the Siberian Division of the Academy of Sciences of U.S.S.R.), vol. 3, No. 4, (1962) pp 470–480 elaborated on this concept in the same time frame that Boudart advanced and promoted this concept. It was Boudart’s way to lead us into the future and remind us of the history that underpins that future. The second Perspective we draw attention to is that of Bhan and Delgass on best practices. Best practices are a recognition that “Many advances in the field can be traced to his [Boudart’s] clear articulation and frequent reminders of the need to follow rigorous procedures for collecting and reporting reaction rate data.” 7 7 W. Nicholas Delgass et al. Technical Dedication: Michel Boudart Special Issue, J. Phys. Chem., 109(6) (2005) pp. 2035-2036. We note that the Bhan and Delgass Perspective has six Boudart citations that we applaud. Even more impressive is the nine cross citations within the Boudart Special Issue. We had thought to suggest that idea to all authors but realized that no one would want to compete with the Bhan and Delgass Perspective. Finally, we want to acknowledge that Nick Delgass worked on this Perspective on his deathbed (died August 17, 2021) and was dedicated to and an outstanding teacher of the Boudart school of thought; he will be greatly missed by his students and colleagues. We are indebted to Aditya Bhan who stepped in to complete and submit the Bhan and Delgass Perspective. Robert and I take great pride in what is now the final version of the Michel Boudart Special Issue and I will take this opportunity describe my personal relationship with Michel. This was initiated by Burwell, who was my Ph.D. mentor and tutor on many topics not involving catalysis, e. g. art, wine, life, etc. In the late 1960s Burwell and Boudart produced “a dog and pony show” on catalysis. This was Burwell’s description of the tutorials on catalysis they presented at several early catalysis club meetings of the North American Catalysis Society. Thus, I first became aware of Michel through conversations with Burwell and first met him circa 1965 while I was a graduate student. Burwell hosted a seminar in the Chemistry Department and I was allotted a few minutes of his time. We must have had many encounters over the next decade, but it was in discussions at and about the Gordon Conference on Catalysis where we began to know each other in some depth. I was elected vice-chair of the Gordon Conference the summer of 1974. Michel always presented himself rather formally, but he was warmhearted and generous once he moved toward friendship. I took advantage of his friendship by asking for his help to organize the program. This gave me reason to engage him on another level. He allowed me to continually consult and discuss my plans for the program for the 1975 Gordon Conference on Catalysis. Thereafter we had an ever-growing friendship, not only based on our mutual research interests in heterogeneous catalysis, but like Burwell, Boudart saw the need to tutor me in art, wine, and the nature of a good life. I miss both of them greatly. Finally, we need to acknowledge those who helped us produce the Boudart Special Issue: Johannes Lercher trusted me with the charge to edit the Special Issue and nominated Robert to be a guest editor but who really became a co-editor. I in turn wish to thank Robert for accepting that nomination. I confess that I took the lead as “senior editor” but appreciated all the direction I got from Robert. At the beginning we sought the counsel of and nomination of invited authors from several editors and Boudart students that included Nicholas Delgass, James Dumesic, Enrique Iglesia, Jae Sung Lee, Johannes Lercher, Rostam Madon, Ted Oyama, and Fabio Ribeiro (who also provided information from the 2005 Michel Boudart Special Issue in the Journal of Physical Chemistry, see footnote 7). We again thank our invited authors and offer our gratitude for mostly staying on schedule and accepting constructive criticism from their reviewers and ourselves; we offer extra gratitude to those authors who doubled their effort as reviewers and a special thanks to the many reviewers who did duty on behalf of the Boudart Special Issue but are not named in the Special Issue. We reserve our final thanks for the Elsevier staff. They were patient with all of our demands and expectations, and we explicitly acknowledge Lily Khidr, our Publisher, who backed this effort from the onset.",
