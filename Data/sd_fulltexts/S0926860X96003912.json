No catalyst deactivation was observed on the disulfides, although the rate was much smaller than that on Ni. It was found that the disulfides exhibited a poor ability for the direct decomposition of CH4. The poor ability did not lead to carbon deposition during reforming reaction, which assured a stable activity. It was also observed that the rate equation was completely different between disulfide catalysts and Ni catalyst. The reaction order was positive with respect to the CH4 partial pressure and negative with respect to the CO2 partial pressure on the former catalysts, while negative with respect to CH4 partial pressure and positive with respect to the CO2 partial pressure on the latter. The observed reaction kinetics suggested that the surface of the disulfide catalyst was abundant in adsorbed CO2, while the surface of Ni catalyst was abundant in adsorbed CH4. The abundance in adsorbed CO2 was considered an unfavorable condition for the direct decomposition of CH4 and as a result, carbon deposition was suppressed during CO2-reforming on disulfide catalyst. Sulfur tolerance was found to be an additional performance of the disulfide catalyst. Keywords: CO2-reforming of CH4; MoS2; WS2; Carbon deposition; Reaction kinetics 1. Introduction The CO2-reforming of CH4 is an attractive reaction, because syngas with a low H2/CO ratio for alcohol synthesis or oxo-synthesis can be obtained therefrom [1- 3]. Supported Ni is known to be a typical catalyst for this reaction. As one of serious problems, carbon deposition is often accompanied by CO2-reforming, by * Corresponding author.

Osaki et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 229-238 which catalyst is deactivated and also the reaction system is disturbed in a way of plugging the gas stream [4-9]. It was reported that carbonaceous materials were accumulated on the catalyst like whiskers, on the top of which nickel particles existed. The mechanism of the growth of carbon is considered to involve diffusion of the dissolved carbon in the nickel crystal [4]. It is, therefore, important to develop a catalyst not only with high activity but also without accompanying carbon deposition. The present authors reported that basic metal oxides were excellent additives for preventing carbon deposition during the CO2-reforming of CH4 on Ni/A1203 [10]. It was found that the added basic metal oxides markedly decreased the ability of Ni catalyst for direct CH4 decomposition, which must be a cause for the suppression of carbon deposition. Kinetic observation showed that the surface of the Ni catalyst with basic metal oxide was abundant in adsorbed CO2 species, which resulted in a further suppression of carbon deposition. It was also reported that carbon-free operation was possible through the partial poisoning of Ni catalyst with sulfur [4-8]. Although it is important to improve Ni catalyst for the suppression of carbon deposition, exploring other catalyst systems is also important. This paper describes the catalyst performance of metal sulfides of Mo and W by comparing with that of Ni/SiO2 catalyst. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts and reagents MoS2 and WS2 catalysts were prepared by decomposing the respective pre- cursors of (NH4)2MoS4 and (NH4)2WS4 (both from Aldrich, >99.9%) in flowing H2. Supported Ni catalyst was prepared by impregnating SiO2 (GL-Science, 402 m2 g-l) with an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2 (Wako Pure Chemical Indus- tries, 98%), followed by drying and subsequently calcining at 773 K for 3 h. Metal loading was 20 wt%. Hydrogen (99.999%) was purified and dried by passing it through a silica gel column. Helium (99.995%) was also purified and dried by passing it through a titanium metal sponge heated at 1073 K and then through a molecular sieve trap. Reactant gases of both CH4 (>99.9%) and CO2 (ca. 99.9%) were used without further purification. Hydrogen sulfide (5 vol% in N2) was used without further purification. 2.2. Characterization of catalysts The surface area of the catalysts was measured through N2 adsorption at 77 K using a Carlo Erba Sorptomatic 1800. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was T. Osaki et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 229-238 231 measured for the disulfide catalysts using a Rigaku RAD-1VC (CuK,~, 30 kV and 30 mA). Chemical analysis of the prepared sulfides was carried out using a sulfur- carbon analyzer and an oxygen-nitrogen analyzer (LECO). The amount of CO adsorbed on the catalyst was measured by a conventional pulse adsorption method. 2.3. Apparatus and procedure Kinetics of the CO2-reforming reaction was investigated using a fixed-bed flow type quartz glass tube microreactor (4 mm i.d.) under atmospheric pressure and differential reactor conditions. After reducing the catalyst in a stream of H2 (40 ml min-1) at 723 K for 3 h, helium (40 ml min-1) was passed over the catalyst at 723 K for 0.5 h. Then, an equimolar mixture of CH4 and CO2 (total flow rate, 28 ml min-1) was flowed over the catalyst in the temperature range 723-973 K. Effluent gases were analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-14A) with a thermal conductivity detector using the combined columns of squalane, molecular sieve 5 A and Porapak Q. Kinetics of carbon deposition in the absence of CO2 was studied by thermal gravimetry (Shimadzu DT-20B). After reducing a catalyst in a quartz basket in flowing H2 at 773 K for 3 h, followed by flushing with helium at 773 K for 0.5 h, CH4 (40 ml min-1) was flowed at 773 K for several hours, during which the catalyst weight was continuously measured. Activity for the CO2 dissociation was examined by a conventional pulse reaction technique. After reducing a catalyst with flowing Ha at 973 K for 3 h, the small amount of CO2 (0.54 ml) was pulsed onto the catalyst at 973 K for 15-16 times via the helium carrier gas (40 ml min-1). The number of CO2 molecules adsorbed dissociatively on a catalyst was determined from the number of CO molecules produced therefrom. Effect of H2S on catalytic activity was investigated under steady-state reaction. After reducing a catalyst, an equimolar mixture of CH4 and CO2 (28 ml min- 1 for the sulfides and 60 ml min-1 for Ni/SiO2) was flowed at 873 K for Ni/SiO2, at 973 K for MoS2 and at 1073 K for WS2. After several hours, 1.25 vol% of H2S (flow rate, 40 ml rain-1) was introduced onto the catalyst instead of the reactant gases for 30 min. Then the reactant gases of CH4 and CO2 were again introduced onto the catalysts under the same conditions. 3. Results 3.1.

CH4-C02 reaction Prior to CH4-CO2 reaction, the decomposition of CH4 was carried out in the absence of CO2 and the result is shown in Fig. 2. As shown, carbon deposition was much more significant on Ni/SiO2 than on disulfide catalysts: the weight increase is very pronounced during 50 min after reaction and moderated thereafter. Different from Ni, the weight increase was suppressed markedly on disulfide catalysts. Carbon deposition was less significant on WS2 than on MoS2 between these two disulfide catalysts.

As shown in Fig. 3, while CH4 conversion was hardly changed on the MoS2, it gradually decreased with time on stream in Ni/SiO2. Fig. 4 summarizes the rates of the CO2-reforming of CH4 as a function of the reaction temperature. Here, the rates, NCH4 (s-l), are normalized in terms of the number of adsorbed CO molecules on the catalyst as shown in Table 1. The sulfide catalysts exhibited lower activity than Ni/SiO2 catalyst. Between the two sulfide catalysts, MoS2 exhibited slightly higher activity than WS2. The apparent activa- tion energy was, on the contrary, slightly larger on WS2 catalyst than on MoS2. Since the rate in Fig. 3 is independent of the number of the active sites, it can be concluded that the disulfide catalysts have intrinsically lower activity for the CO2- reforming of CH4 than the supported Ni catalyst. Fig. 5 plots the rate of CO2-reforming, r (s-l), as a function of the partial pressures of each reactant gas. The reaction orders determined from the slopes of the straight lines are summarized in Table 2. On Ni/SiO2, the reaction order was negative with respect to the CH4 partial pressure and positive with respect to the CO2 partial pressure. This result is almost similar to that already reported on Ni/AI203 (r = kP-7/~21\"1 [10] or on Ni/SiOe (r = bp002 0.05p0.5-0.6'~ [1 1]. For '~CH4 ~C02 ] '~CH4 --CO2 J disulfide catalysts, on the other hands, just the opposite results were obtained: positive with respect to the CH4 partial pressure and negative with respect to the COa partial pressure. Fig. 6 illustrates the activity for CO2 dissociation in the absence of CH4 on disulfide and on supported Ni catalysts. It is interesting to note that compared with supported Ni, WSa exhibited very high activity for COa dissociation especially at the initial period of pulse reaction. Fig. 7 shows the effect of H2S on the activity of the catalyst for CO2-reforming. While the introduction of H2S caused a rapid decrease in CH4 conversion on supported Ni, no such decrease was observed on both disulfides. T.

Discussion Compared with Ni/SiO2, MoS2 and WS2 exhibited interesting features for the CO2-reforming of CH4, viz.

Except the features (ii) and (v), similar features were also observed for CO2-reforming on Ni/AI203 catalyst with basic metal oxides. The gradual decrease observed in CH4 conversion during the CO2-reforming of CH4 on Ni/SiO2 should result from carbon deposited from CH4, because CH4 is readily decomposed on this catalyst. From the dependence of the rate on the partial pressures, the surface of this catalyst is concluded abundant in CH4 (or hydrogen- deficient CHx species), which provides a condition for carbon deposition. Different from Ni/SiO2, MoS2 exhibited a stable activity for CO2-reforming. It is very natural to consider that the amount of surface carbon produced from CH4 decomposition should be limited on disulfide, because this catalyst has extremely T. Osaki et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 229-238 237 low ability for CH4 decomposition. The low ability for methane decomposition can be ascribed to that effective whisker carbon mechanism on nickel as it does not work on sulfides. No carbon deposition assures the stable activity for the steady- state CO2-reforming of CH4, as observed in Fig. 2. The dependence of the rate on the partial pressures also assures the condition of the carbon-free surface of disulfide catalyst. The surface of this catalyst is abundant in CO2. Or correctly describing, the surface is covered with oxygen atoms, Oad~, derived from CO2 dissociation, because CO2 is readily dissociated on disulfide. On such a surface, the reaction of CH4 with Oad to produce CO and H2 precedes the decomposition of CH4 to give surface carbon, C~. From these two reasons, carbon deposition is highly suppressed on disulfide catalyst, leading to a stable activity for the CO2- reforming of CH4. The CO2-reforming of CH4 is believed to proceed according to the following steps: the stepwise dehydrogenation of CH4 to adsorbed hydrocarbon species: Eq. (1), CO2 dissociation to adsorbed oxygen atom: Eq. (2), and surface reaction between adsorbed species to CO and H2: Eq. (3). CH4 + [*] ~ CH4,ad --+ CH3,ad ---+ CH2,ad --+ CHad ---+ C (l) CO2 + [*] --+ CO + Oad (2) CHx,ad + Oad ~ CO + x/2H2 + 2[*] (3) Assuming that Eqs. (1) and (2) are in equilibrium and that Eq. (3) is rate- determining [12,13], the reaction rate is expressed by k( KcH4Kco2PcH~Pco2 )1/2 r = kOcnx[,]Oo[,] {1 + (KcH4PCH4)1/2 + (Kco2Pc02)I/2}2 (4) where k is the rate constant, Oi is the concentration of adsorbed species i, Ki is the adsorption equilibrium constant for species i, and Pi is the partial pressure of reactant i. Eq. (4) is approximated by Eq. (5) or Eq. (6), respectively, according to the condition of Kcm >> 1 and KCO2 or of Kco2 >> 1 and KCH4. r = k (Kco2 Pco2/Kc~ PCH4 ) 1/2 (5) r = k(Kcn4PcH4/Kco2Pco2)l/2 (6) The kinetics observed on Ni/SiO2 and on disulfide catalysts are explained by Eqs. (5) and (6), respectively, although precise agreement is not obtained due to the extreme approximation in the assumption. The assumption of large values of KCH4 on Ni/SiO2 and of Kco2 on disulfide catalyst may be rationalized by the findings shown in Figs. 2 and 6, respectively. Lacking of the ability of disulfide catalyst for the stepwise dehydrogenation of CH4 may be the reason for the activity much lower than that of Ni/SiO2 for the CO2-reforming. It is known that for most reactions, supported Ni catalyst is poisoned strongly by a sulfur compound owing to surface sulfide probably formed on active sites. Our 238 Z Osaki et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 229-238 Ni/SiO2 was indeed poisoned almost completely by H2S during the CO2-reform- ing. Different from Ni/SiO2, the disulfide catalysts were not poisoned by HzS at all during the CO2-reforming. This may be because further sulfidation, leading to catalyst deactivation, does not occur on the disulfide catalysts. 5. Conclusions The CO2-reforming of methane was investigated on MoS2 and WS2 by compar- ison to a supported Ni catalyst. Catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition was not observed on the sulfides during CO2-reforming, although the rate was smaller than that on Ni. Rate equations for both catalysts were determined. From the dependence of reaction rate on the partial pressures of CH4 and CO2, it could be deduced that the sulfide surface was covered with CO2[ads] (or O[ads]) during the steady-state CH4-CO2 reaction. The abundance in adsorbed CO2 was also considered an unfavorable condition for the direct decomposition of methane and as a result, carbon deposition was much suppressed on the sulfides. No catalyst deactivation was also observed on the sulfide catalysts by the admission of HzS during the reforming. References [1] J.R. Rostrup-Nielsen, Catalytic steam reforming, in: J.R. Anderson, M.

Tel.: +81 52 911 2111; fax: +81 52 916 6993 The catalyst performance of MoS2 and WS2 was verified for the CO2-reforming of CH4 through the comparison with that of Ni SiO2 . No catalyst deactivation was observed on the disulfides, although the rate was much smaller than that on Ni. It was found that the disulfides exhibited a poor ability for the direct decomposition of CH4. The poor ability did not lead to carbon deposition during reforming reaction, which assured a stable activity. It was also observed that the rate equation was completely different between disulfide catalysts and Ni catalyst. The reaction order was positive with respect to the CH4 partial pressure and negative with respect to the CO2 partial pressure on the former catalysts, while negative with respect to CH4 partial pressure and positive with respect to the CO2 partial pressure on the latter. The observed reaction kinetics suggested that the surface of the disulfide catalyst was abundant in adsorbed CO2, while the surface of Ni catalyst was abundant in adsorbed CH4. The abundance in adsorbed CO2 was considered an unfavorable condition for the direct decomposition of CH4 and as a result, carbon deposition was suppressed during CO2-reforming on disulfide catalyst. Sulfur tolerance was found to be an additional performance of the disulfide catalyst. Keywords CO2-reforming of CH4 MoS2 WS2 Carbon deposition Reaction kinetics References [1] J.R.
