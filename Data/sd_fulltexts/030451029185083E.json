James Feast and David B. Harrison Chemistry Department, Durham University, South Road, Durham DH1 3LE (U.K.) Abstract ;ro,e;ro-5,6-bis(methoxymethyl)-7-oxabicylo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene was polymerised by aqueous emulsion ROMP using the trichlorides of ruthenium, indium and osmium as catalysts. The inclusion of c s-but-2-ene-l,4-diol or its dimethyl ether in the reaction mixture had a marked effect on both induction times and reactivity, and allowed control of the molecular weight of the product polymers, poly{2,5-[3,4-bis(methoxymethyl)- furanylene]vinylene}s. Introduction Early publications on ring-opening metathesis polymerisation (ROMP) reported that the salts and complexes of ruthenium [I], iridium [2] and osmium [3] in mixtures of water, ethanol and halogenated organic solvents were effective for the polymerisation of norbomene and some of its derivatives [4]. Recent publications by Novak and Grubbs [5, 6] have demonstrated the particular applicability of ruthenium salts in the polymerisation of certain heteropolycyclic alkenes in purely aqueous media. In this paper the aqueous emulsion polymerisation of ea;o,ea;o-5,6-bis(methoxymethyl)-7-oxabicy- clo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (I) is reported using ruthenium, iridium and osmium chlorides as the precursors of the active ROMP initiators. The molecular weights of the polymers were altered using cis-but-2-ene-l,4-diol and its dimethyl ether as chain transfer agents. The use of these acyclic olefins also effects both reactivity of the polymerising species and the induction time in a complex manner. Experimental Materials Laboratory grade reagents, solvents and metal halides (Aldrich Chemical) were used as supplied. Monomer synthesis 'a;o,e.ro-5,6-bis(methoxymethyl)-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1 ]hept-2-ene (I) was obtained via reduction of the Diels Alder adduct offuran and maleic anhydride 0304-5102/91/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 64 [7, 8], followed by methylation of the diol with methyl iodide/sodium hydride [9]. Distillation under reduced pressure gave the pure monomer in ca. 50% yield with respect to furan [5]. Polymerisations In general the polymerisations were performed by adding aqueous so- lutions of the metal halide to stirred emulsions of the monomer in either pure water or mixtures of water and a chain transfer agent (CTA), cis-but- 2-ene-l,4-diol or its dimethyl ether. All the polymerisations were performed at 55.0 0.1 C under a normal laboratory atmosphere and were run for two days. The product polymers, poly{2,5-[3,4-bis(methoxymethyl)- furanylene]vinylene}s (II), were recovered by filtration, thoroughly washed with water, dried under vacuum, dissolved in chloroform, reprecipitated into a large excess of pentane, and finally dried and stored under vacuum in the dark. The polymers were white solids; exposure to air resulted in slow degradation as evidenced by a yellow/green colouration. Typical experimental conditions and polymer yields are recorded in Tables 1, 2 and 3 for the ruthenium system. Comparison of ruthenium, iridium and osmium initiation in the absence of chain transfer agents is made in Table 4.

''Determined by 'H NMR spectroscopy. Results and discussion The polymerisation process is outlined in Fig. 1, which' also records the numbering system used throughout this paper. The yields of polymer obtained using ruthenium(III) and osimum(III) chlorides were good, whereas those from experiments using iridium(III) chloride were poor (see Table 4). The microstructural analysis of poly(norbomene)s has been discussed in detail [10], and the analysis established can be directly applied to these heterocyclic analogues. The monomer (I) used in this work is symmetrical 66 TABLE 4 Polymerisations of monomer I initiated by RuClg-SHaO, IrCLj-SHzO and OsClg-SHaO in water Parameter RuC^-SHaO IrClj-aHgO OsCl3-3HaO monomer 1.0 g 1-0 g 1.0 g catalyst 0.07 g 0.07 g 0.07 g water 7.5 ml 7.5 ml 7.5 ml temp. 55 \"C 55 -C 55 C yield 95% 2.0% 95% Xn 155K 20K 5K double bonds 60% trans 90% trans 75% trans ROMP Fig. 1.

The double bonds may be cis or trans, and the allylic methines on either side of the double bonds are chiral and may have opposite chirality, giving meso- or m-dyads and isotactic polymer, or the same chirality giving racemic- or r-dyads and syndiotactic polymer. Thus, there are four possible homopolymer microstructures and a variety of other microstructures determined by cis /trans and meso/racemic dyad sequence effects. The stereochemical constraints in the monomer carried over into the polymer result in syn relationships between the pairs of methoxymethyls and vinylic allylic C C bonds, and an anti relationship between the meth- oxymethyls and vinylic-allylic bonds. Initially the polymerisations were performed with no CTA, and produced, as evidenced by the 'H and \"C NMR spectra, three different microstructures from the three different initiator systems. The ^H NMR spectra are shown in Fig. 2 and their assignments, which follow in a straightforward way from the shirts and integrations, are recorded in Table 5; it is clear from this data that there is a variation in cis /trans vinylene content with initiator system. The \"C spectra (Fig. 3 and Table 6) are also readily assigned: the vinylic carbons occurring at lowest field, carbons 1 and 4 (being both allylic and adjacent to oxygen) are next to the vinylics, followed by the ether methylenes (C-8 and 9) and methyls (C-10 and 11), with the carbons at C-5 and 6 at 67 10,11 Monomer Polymer II prepared with OsCl-.3H,0 catalyst Polymer II prepared with IrCl3.3H,0 catalyst Polyer II prepared with SuCl,.3H,0 catalyst ppn Fig. 2.

The allylic carbons allow an unambiguous assignment ofvinylene content, since it is invariably found in polymers of this kind that c&s-allylic carbon signals occur about 5 ppm upfield from those arising from trans- 68 TABLE 5 'H NMR spectral parameters for monomer and polymer (250 MHz, CDCL}) H at position Chemical shifts (ppm) monomer polymer 2 and 3 6.32 (s) 5.68 (trans) 5.50(CTS) 1 and 4 4.68 (s) 4.62 (cis) 4.48 (cis) 4.17 (trews) 5 and 6 1.80 (m) 2.22 8 and 9 3.34 (m) 3.38 3.25 (m) 3.29 10 and 11 3.28 (s) 3.29 allylic carbons [10]; in this case the signals occur at 82.13 and 77.20 ppm, with the cts-allylic signal being the minor peak. Thus, the NMR spectra provide unambiguous evidence that all samples produced in this work contain predominantly trans vinylenes, 60% for RuCls-SHaO, 75% for OsCla-SHaO and 90% for IrCls-SHaO. Inspection of the spectra in Figs. 2 and 3 demonstrates that all these polymers are atactic. This is most readily seen in the \"C NMR data, in which the signals assigned to C-2 and 3 (cis/trans vinylenes), C-l and 4 (allylic carbons) and C-5 and 6 are all multiplets or broad signals. Thus, the vinylic carbons at 133.87 ppm (cis) and 133.24 ppm (trans) show a splitting of the cis signal in all cases, but only a single trans resonance. In the 'H NMR spectra the methine protons on positions 1 and 4 resonate at 4.17 ppm (trans) and 4.48 ppm (cis). In the case of the ruthenium-initiated poly- merisation, there is an additional cis signal at 4.62 ppm. This signal appears in all the polymers prepared with the ruthenium catalyst regardless of molecular weight. The corresponding \"C NMR of the region for the ruthenium-initiated polymerisation shows a single trans methine resonance at 82.13 ppm but a complex multiplet for the cis methine at 77.20 ppm. In the absence of other evidence it is not possible to determine if these multiplicities arise from cis /trans sequence effects or tacticity effects. The metal halides used to generate the initiators for these polymerisations are invariably complex mixtures and it seems likely that the exact composition will vary with the source [11]. In their earlier work Grubbs and Novak observed only one c^s-allylic signal in the ^ NMR of polymer II prepared from RuCIs 3HaO initiation [5, 12], this difference between our present results and theirs is probably attributable to differences in the catalyst starting material. One of our objectives in this work was to prepare low molecular weight materials, and with this in mind, czs-but-2-ene-l ,4-diol and cis-1,4-dimethoxy- but-2-ene were investigated as chain transfer agents for the RuCls^HaO- ^ ^ Monomer I 2 3 ;. . -, J- ^ .....

Initially cis-but-2-ene-l,4-diol was used in low concentration (<1% w/w Table 1) to assess its effect on the catalyst, subsequently both CTAs were employed in much larger concentration so that they formed a major part of the solvent mixture (Tables 2 and 3) At 71 1% w/w concentration, CTS-but-2-ene-l,4-diol decreased the initiation period for the reaction from approximately 3 h to 10 min, in the cases where the CTA is a co-solvent, the initiation period is a matter of seconds. With cis- 1,4-dimethoxybut-2-ene as CTA there was no noticeable effect on the initiation period, although chain transfer did occur. Plots of reciprocal Mn against ratio of CTA concentration to monomer concentration allows the chain transfer constant to be determined [10]. Such plots for this system are shown in Fig. 4. Although the plots give reasonably good straight lines, the chain transfer constants in both cases are very small, 7.3xl0~5 and 2.0X10\"6 for the diol and dimethyl ether respectively, implying that the rate of propagation is very fast with respect to chain transfer. However, it is important to note that we are dealing with a heterogeneous polymerisation, and consequently, although they provide a qualitative indication of relative chain transfer efficiency, little quantitative weight can be attached to the numerical values. The situation is complex and not readily amenable to study since the monomer is soluble in but-2-ene-l,4-diol but not in l,4-dimethoxybut-2-ene; thus as the concentration of the CTA increases, the reaction mixture becomes more homogeneous in the case of the diol but not in the case of the diether. Thus differences in the initiation rate could be the result of changes in the homogeneity of the dispersing media, or there could be an involvement of the diol groups on the catalyst centre which increases the rate. Conclusion Polymers of e^o,ea;o-5,6-bis(methoxymethyl)-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1 ]hept-2- ene can be prepared in aqueous emulsion using chlorides of ruthenium, iridium and osmium as ROMP catalysts. The molecular weight of the polymers can be varied between 155 K and 1 K by using but-2-ene-l,4-diol as a chain transfer agent, which has a secondary effect of decreasing the initiation period for the reaction in the case of the ruthenium catalyst. In all cases the microstructure of the polymer is altered only by the catalyst, and is not dependent on the molecular weight or solvent composition.
