The catalysts were characterized by N 2 adsorption, CO 2 temperature-programmed desorption, H 2 temperature-programmed reduction, Fourier transform infrared spectros- copy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Both the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/ SBA-15 catalysts gave good catalytic activities at atmospheric pressure. The CeO 2 impregnated Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst exhibited excellent stability at 800 ÂºC for 100 h on stream, and after the reaction, carbon deposits were not formed on the catalyst. The Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalysts had a regular hexagonal mesoporous structure. The nickel species and the Ce-Mo oxide components were all in the SBA-15 mesopores. This prevented carbon deposition and sintering of the nickel species in the CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst. Key words: carbon dioxide reforming; methane; nickel; molybdenum; mesoporous molecular sieve SBA-15, cerium-promoted Carbon dioxide reforming of methane (CDRM) is of great interest for environmental protection because the reaction consumes two important greenhouse gases and convert them into a valuable feedstock [13]. CDRM produces a H 2 /CO ratio that is more suitable for Fisher-Tropsch and methanol synthe- ses, and would allow methane, a major component of natural gas, to be used for energy production with low emission of CO 2 . The reaction is interesting because it can decrease the total emission of greenhouse gases. Numerous transition metals have been shown to have high activity and stability in this reaction, especially the noble metals and Ni-based catalysts [4,5]. Although noble metal catalysts show better performance than Ni-based catalysts, Ni-based catalysts have attracted in- terest due to their low cost [6,7]. However, this reaction cannot be applied industrially because it is accompanied by carbon deposition and metal sintering, especially on Ni catalysts, which lead to loss of catalytic activity and poor stability of the catalyst [810]. Therefore, preventing carbon deposition and metal sintering are of great importance for the reforming reac- tion on a Ni catalyst. An effective approach to develop good Ni catalysts is to focus on the selection and modification of the catalyst support [11,12]. There are positive effects of CeO 2 on catalytic activity, stability, and carbon suppression from the addition of CeO 2 into catalysts for the CDRM when it is used as a promoter instead of as a support with a strong metal-support interaction, which are reduced Ni sintering and carbon deposition [1315]. Wang et al. [16] reported that a CeO 2 promoted catalyst was stable and the increase in stability was related to the increase in oxygen storage capacity that facilitated carbon removal from the metal particle. Roh et al. [17] reported that the ability to provide mobile oxygen species from the support to Ni played an important role in preventing carbon deposition and that using CeO 2 as a support gave a stable catalyst. The mesoporous molecular sieve SBA-15 possesses large pores, thick walls, and high thermal stability, and is a promising catalyst support, HUANG Jina et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 637â€“644 particularly for reactions at high temperatures [1820], with the intimate contact of Ni and support, better Ni dispersion, higher Ni surface area, and enhanced oxygen transfer during the reaction. In our previous work [21], we found that Ni-based catalysts modified with La 2 O 3 prepared by wet impregnation had ex- cellent catalytic activity and stability, which are due to the highly and uniformly dispersed small metallic Ni particles, reducibility of the Ni oxides and an interaction between the metallic Ni particles and the La-Mo oxide component. In this study, we investigated activity and carbon formation during CDRM over CeO 2 -promoted Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalysts. Better stability and activity were obtained when CeO 2 was used as a modifying additive. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation The mesoporous molecular sieve SBA-15 was synthesized as follows. Triblock copolymer P123 (6.0 g, Aldrich, EO 20 PO 70 EO 20 , M = 5800) was dissolved in a solution con- sisting of 150 g deionized water and 90 g hydrochloric acid (4 mol/L). The solution was stirred at 40 ÂºC for 1 h, 15 g tetraethyl orthosilicate (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) was slowly added to the mixture, and this was kept with vigorous stirring at 40 ÂºC for 24 h. The gel mixture was transferred into a Teflon bottle and aged at 100 ÂºC for 24 h under static condi- tions. The solid product was filtered, washed with deionized water, dried at room temperature, and calcined at 550 ÂºC for 6 h in air to remove the triblock copolymer organic template. The Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalysts were prepared by the wet impregnation method. All the chemical reagents used were from Sinopharm Chemical Re- agent Co. Ltd. A weighed amount of (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 Â·4H 2 O was placed in a 100 ml beaker and a small amount of distilled water was added. After 30 min, the appropriate mass of support (SBA-15) was added under continuous stirring. The slurry was heated to 80 ÂºC and maintained at that temperature until all the water had evaporated. The residue was dried at 100 ÂºC. Nickel nitrate Ni(NO 3 ) 2 6H 2 O and cerium nitrate hexahydrate Ce(NO 3 ) 3 6H 2 O were added in turn in the same way. After impregnation, the samples were dried for 24 h at 100 ÂºC and then calcined at 550 ÂºC for 6 h in air. The nominal composition of the catalyst was 5 wt% Ni, 25 wt% MoO 3 , and 2 wt% CeO 2 . The catalyst powder formed was pressed into flakes, crushed, and sieved to the 6080 mesh fraction for further use. 1.2 Catalytic activity CDRM was conducted at atmospheric pressure with a tu- bular fixed bed quartz microreactor (i.d.: 8.0 mm, length: 450 mm). A thermocouple was placed in the catalyst bed to monitor the reaction temperature (usually set at 800 ÂºC). The reaction gases consisted of CO 2 and CH 4 with the molar ratio of 1:1 at a GHSV of 12000 ml/(h? g cat ). The catalyst of 6080 mesh parti- cle size (300 mg) was diluted with 1.0 g quartz sand (4060 mesh) and held in place by quartz wool. Prior to reaction, the sample was reduced with a hydrogen flow of 20 ml/min at a heating rate of 10 ? C/min from room temperature to 800 ÂºC and then held at 800 ÂºC for 2 h in a feed composition of H 2 /N 2 = 1:1.5. Then, the catalyst was flushed with N 2 and fed with the reaction gases. The product gas was analyzed with an online gas chromatograph (Haixin, GC-950) equipped with a TCD detector. 1.3 Catalyst characterization X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Ri- gaku D/max 2250 powder X-ray diffraction apparatus with monochromatized Cu K (40 kV, 100 mA) radiation using a 2 angle range from 20Âº to 80Âº with a speed of 8Â°/min. Nitrogen physisorption was measured on a Sorptomatic 1990 apparatus at 196 ÂºC. The 200 mg sample was degassed at 200 ÂºC for 2 h under 20 Âµm Hg prior to adsorption. H 2 temperature-pro- grammed reduction (H 2 -TPR) and CO 2 temperature-pro- grammed desorption of (CO 2 -TPD) were performed using a TP-5000 (Xianquan) apparatus equipped with a TCD detector. The H 2 -TPR experiments were performed using a quartz re- actor containing 50 mg of the catalyst in the flow of reducing gas (5% H 2 balanced with N 2 ) at a flow rate of 20 m1/min and a heating rate of 10 ÂºC/min from room temperature up to 800 ÂºC for the CO 2 -TPD experiments, the catalyst powder (50 mg) was held in a quartz tube and CO 2 pulse adsorption was carried out at room temperature. Ultra high purity helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 ml/min and a ramp rate of 10 ? C/min from room temperature up to 800 ÂºC was used. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra were recorded using a FTS-165 (Bio-Rad Com.) spectrometer. The oxide samples were mixed with potassium bromide (KBr) and ground to a very fine powder. Using very high pressure, the mixture was pressed into a transparent disk containing ap- proximately 2 wt% of sample, which was then placed directly in the infrared beam in a suitable holder in air. The scanned range was 400?4000 cm ? 1 . The scanning electron microscope (SEM) was a Philips XL-30 instrument operated at 20 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was acquired on an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer equipped with Al K (h =1486.6 eV) excitation. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalytic activity and stability The catalytic activity and stability were measured at 800 ÂºC with a feed gas ratio CH 4 /CO 2 of 1 at a GHSV of 12000 HUANG Jina et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 637â€“644 ml/(h ? g cat ). CH 4 and CO 2 conversions with time on stream for the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst are presented in Fig. 1. The initial CH 4 conversion on Ni/Mo/SBA-15 was 87.6%, and this de- creased to 86% after reaction for 100 h. The CO 2 conversion was over 96% at the beginning, and it was maintained at this level during the reaction time of 100 h on stream. The product H 2 /CO ratio from the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst was stable and maintained at around 0.90 for 100 h on stream. The CH 4 and CO 2 conversions of the Ce/Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst are presented in Fig. 2. The profiles showed that the CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst gave a higher activity initially and had a continuously higher activity and stability. The initial conversions of CH 4 and CO 2 were, respectively, 90% and 98% on the CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst. Both these high conver- sions were maintained for 100 h on stream. The selectivity given as the H 2 /CO ratio in Fig. 2 was stable at around 0.9 for 100 h on stream. The results indicated that the CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/ SBA-15 catalyst gave higher activity and stability in the CO 2 reforming of methane. CeO 2 can enhance catalytic performance by a metal-support interaction, or by the oxygen-storage/transport ability of the support [22] or by the generation of active sites at the interface between metal and support [23]. The high oxygen storage capacity of CeO 2 improves catalytic performance by storing oxygen during oxidation and releasing it during reduction, which inhibits carbon deposition [24] and improves the metal-support interaction, which results in higher activity and stability. 2.2 N 2 adsorption-desorption Figures 3 and 4 show the structural parameters of pure SBA-15, and the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalysts. All of the catalysts exhibited type IV isotherms, showing the mesoporous nature of the samples. The adsorption isotherms of samples showed a sharp inflection at the relative pressure of 0.60, which is characteristic of capillary conden- sation in uniform pores. The specific surface area and pore diameter of pure SBA-15 were 650.0 m 2 /g and 8.3 nm, re- spectively. In contrast to pure SBA-15, the adsorbed amounts on the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalysts showed a decrease.

HUANG Jina et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 637â€“644 CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 were 358.0 m 2 /g and 8.3 nm, respec- tively. The total pore volume of SBA-15 was 1.12 cm 3 /g, but those of the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 cata- lysts were 0.45 and 0.74 cm 3 /g. The total pore volumes of 0.45 and 0.74 cm 3 /g in the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/ SBA-15 catalysts were attributed to the deposition of the Ni and Mo components in the pores of SBA-15. Clearly, the sample with CeO 2 , i.e., the CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst, had the larger surface area and pore volume. A previous study showed that the properties of the carbon formed during the reforming process depended on the structure of the support and that active carbon was formed only on the mesoporous Al 2 O 3 -supported Ni catalysts [25]. This indicated that CH 4 decomposed rapidly on the higher dispersed Ni par- ticles. In this study, the CeO 2 modified Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst possessed a mesoporous structure and large surface area. The higher specific surface area of the catalyst allowed a stronger interaction between Ni and Mo-CeO 2 , which improved the dispersion of Ni, and retarded the sintering of Ni during CO 2 reforming. The highly dispersed Ni increased the adsorption of CO 2 , and gave higher reforming activity, lower coke formation and higher stability. 2.3 CO 2 -TPD results CO 2 -TPD was performed to determine the basicity of the catalysts, which is very important for the stability of the cata- lyst [2628]. Figure 5 shows the CO 2 -TPD profiles of the different catalysts. There were three CO 2 desorption peaks in the profile of the CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst in Fig. 5(2). This indicated that there were three kinds of basic sites on the surface of the catalyst. CO 2 adsorption in the range of 279354 ÂºC can be attributed to CO 2 that was chemically adsorbed. The low temperature desorption peak at 490550 ÂºC was attributed to species such as MoO 2 CO 3 generated by CO 2 interaction with MoO 2 , and the high temperature peak at about 630 ÂºC was attributed to the decomposition of carbonate generated from the interaction between CO 2 and the catalyst [29]. The CO 2 -TPD profile of the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst had just one desorption peak at about 430 ÂºC in Fig. 5(1). This means only one basic site existed in the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst. The amount of desorbed CO 2 was small. It can be inferred that the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst has fewer basic sites than the CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst. The CO 2 -TPD results showed that both catalysts have basic sites, but the catalysts exhibited a big difference in the number of basic sites. The BET results showed that the specific surface area and pore volume of the CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst were 358.0 m 2 /g and 0.74 cm 3 , and were 202.2 m 2 /g and 0.45 cm 3 /g for the Ni/Mo/SBA-15catalyst, respectively. The textural structure of the two catalysts exhibited a big difference. Therefore, the difference in the number of the basic sites in the two catalysts may be due to the difference in the textural and structural properties of the two catalysts. CeO 2 actually has dual roles in preventing carbon deposition in the CO 2 reforming of methane. On one hand, addition of CeO 2 decreased the acidity of the support. This would stop pyrolytic carbon formation, and the basic CeO 2 helps the chemisorption and dissociation of CO 2 and subsequently ac- celerate carbon elimination by the CO 2 + C = 2CO reaction. On the other hand, CeO 2 dispersed in SBA-15 and the Ni crystal- lites can prevent excessive growth of the Ni grains at high temperatures. 2.4 H 2 -TPR results The H 2 -TPR profiles of the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalysts are shown in Fig. 6. There was one peak at 540 ÂºC for the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst as shown in Fig. 5(1). In contrast, there were two reduction peaks at 540 and 590 ÂºC for the CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst as shown in Fig. 6(2). The first main peak was attributed to the reduction of surface NiO, MoO 3 , and CeO 2 species while the second small peak corresponded to the reduction of metal ions of Mo 3+ in- corporated into the silica framework of SBA-15. The presence of a small amount of molybdenum silicate cannot be excluded 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 Temperature (Â°C) I n t e n s i t y 430 340 470 630 (1) (2) Fig. 5.

HUANG Jina et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 637â€“644 due to the high reduction temperature [30]. It was reported that NiO shows a peak at 360 ÂºC [31], and free NiO species on the support with no interaction has a peak maximum at about 400 ÂºC with a starting temperature of 300 ÂºC [32]. The higher temperature peaks were assigned to the re- duction of Ni species in intimate contact with the oxide support [32]. The absence of NiO and free NiO species in the TPR profiles of Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalysts suggested a broad particle size distribution associated with a more dispersed NiO exhibiting a stronger interaction with the support. This was probably because the addition of Ce favored the formation of NiO species that strongly interacted with CeO 2 , which was hardly sintered during methane reforming. 2.5 FT-IR analysis The FT-IR spectra of fresh and used Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalysts are shown in Fig. 7. They all showed characteristic peaks of the mesoporous molecular sieve SBA-15. The absorption peaks at 1085 and 810 cm ? 1 were due to asymmetric stretching and symmetric stretching of frame- work SiOSi, and the absorption peaks at 460 cm ? 1 was due to the bending vibration of framework SiOSi. The absorption peak at 950 cm ? 1 was due to the Si-OH non-bridging oxygen stretching vibration. Low angle XRD patterns (0.5Â°6Â°) were used to identify the properties of SBA-15 mesoporous molecular sieves used for Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15. Figure 8 is the low angle XRD patterns for the pure SBA-15 mesoporous mo- lecular sieve, Ni/Mo/SBA-15, and CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 after reaction for 100 h. All the catalysts displayed the (100) peak of the two-dimensional hexagonal space group P6mm, while the 2 = 0.84Â°, 1.45Â°, and 1.68Â° peaks were from the (100), (110), and (200) phases of SBA-15, respectively. This showed that a two dimensional hexagonal and stable SBA-15 molecular sieve with a mesoporous structure was prepared. Moreover, the original pore structure of the support was not damaged by the Ni and Mo loading and after reaction for 100 h at 800 ÂºC. These results are consistent with the FT-IR spectra analysis. They revealed that the hexagonal arrangement of the SBA-15 framework was not destroyed and there was effective sup- pression of the mechanical disintegration of CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/ SBA-15 when metal oxides were loaded in SBA-15. This indicated that the catalyst had excellent activity and stability at high temperatures. This may be due to the porous wall of the SBA-15 that prevented aggregation of the Ni particles in the mesopores of the SBA-15 molecular sieve. 2.6 XRD analysis Figure 9 shows the XRD patterns of fresh Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 after calcination at 550 ÂºC for 6 h in air. For the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst (Fig. 9(1)), characteristic diffraction peaks at 2 of 23.67Â°, 27.03Â°, 28.89Â°, 32.89Â°, and 47.47Â° were observed, which can be ascribed to the presence of MoO 3 and NiMoO 4 . Notably, specific peaks of NiO were found at 2 of 39.09Â°, 43.95Â°, and 62.05Â° in the XRD patterns, indi- 0 600 1200 1800 2400 3000 3600 4200 T r a n s m i t t a n c e Wavenumber (cm ? 1 ) 4 6 0 8 1 0 9 5 0 1 0 8 5 (1) (2) (3) (4) Fig. 7.

HUANG Jina et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 637â€“644 cating that the active metal species were not well dispersed in the SBA-15 [33]. However, the peaks were wide enough to suggest that the sample was not well crystallized. The peak intensity was greatly decreased and only one MoO 3 peaks was detected for the CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst, suggesting the Ni metal was well dispersed in the SBA-15 (Fig. 9(2)). Figure 10 depicts the XRD patterns of Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalysts after reaction for 100 h. Two main peaks were observed (at 2 = 26.0Â°, 37.7Â°, 53.5Â°, 27.3Â°, and 39Â°) with both samples, which showed that both MoO 2 and MoO 3 were present. In fact, NiMoO 4 and Mo 2 C was expected after reaction for 100 h at 800 Â°C (at 2 = 43.5Â°, 34.8Â°, 38.08Â°, 52.18Â°, 61.58Â°, 69.68Â°, 74.68Â°, and 75.68Â°) [34]. Notably, the specific peak of Ni (at 2 = 51.9Â°) was found in the XRD pat- terns of the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst, indicating that the active metal species was sintered after reaction for 100 h (Fig.10(2)). However, no characteristic peak belonging to NiO or Ni crys- tallites was observed for the CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst. This may be because the dispersion of the NiO species was more homogeneous and higher due to the CeO 2 promoter. Carbon deposition was not detected for the catalyst loaded with CeO 2 , probably because of carbon deposition suppression by CeO 2 (Fig.10(1)). The diffraction peak at 21Â° was attributed to SiO 2 , which was from the quartz sand in the catalyst. In recent studies, CeO 2 was used as a promoter due to its positive effects on the activity of Ni-based catalysts in CDRM. According to Xu et al. [35], CeO 2 as a promoter exerted influences on the Ni/Al 2 O 3 used for CH 4 reforming with CO 2 from two aspects. First, the addition of CeO 2 to Ni/Al 2 O 3 shifted the reforming reaction to lower temperatures and improved Ni dispersion. Second, there were electronic interactions between CeO 2 and Ni which were beneficial for inhibiting carbon deposition. Chen et al. [36] proposed the following explanation for the interaction between Ni and CeO 2 . It is well known that CeO 2 is a n-type semiconductor. Thus, in the CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst for the reforming reaction, H 2 originating from CH 4 decomposition can reduce CeO 2 , and some electron-rich oxygen vacancies are produced. The oxygen vacancies release free electrons that migrate from the CeO 2 through the Ni-CeO 2 interface to the Ni 0 centers, thus increasing the d-electron densities of the Ni atoms. The electron rich Ni atoms inhibited the cracking of CH 4 and led to an enhancement of the carbon elimination reaction. 2.7 XPS analysis The surface composition of the CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 cata- lysts from XPS is listed in Table 1. The NiO and CeO 2 phase did not appear on the catalyst surface . This is consistent with the Mo 3d XPS profiles shown in Fig. 11. This showed the presence of Mo 3d in several states located at 228.4, 231.8, 232.5, and 235.5 eV. According to the literature, the peaks at 232.5 and 235.5 eV were due to molybdenum oxidized phases [37,38] in the CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst, and the peaks at 228.4 and 231.8 eV can be attributed to Mo atoms in the car- bide form [37,38] on the CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst after running for 100 h on stream. This meant that the NiO species interacted more with CeO 2 and interacted less with MoO 3 . It indicated that the Ni species had a strong metal-support inter- action and a strong interaction between NiO and CeO 2 . It was likely that the addition of Ce led to a strong metal-support interaction for the NiO species and the support. Combined with the XPS characterization results, the higher activity and sta- bility of CeO 2 -doped Ni/Mo/SBA-15 can be associated with the promoting effect and the NiO species highly dispersed on the surface of the CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst, which are the active component for carbon dioxide reforming of methane. 20 28 36 44 52 60 68 76 SiO 2 MoO 2 MoO 3 Mo 2 C NiMoO 4 Ni I n t e n s i t y 2? /( o ) (1) (2) Fig. 10.

HUANG Jina et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 637â€“644 2.8 SEM analysis Figure 12 shows SEM images of SBA-15 and in fresh CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and Ni/Mo/SBA-15. It can be seen from Fig. 12(a) that the images provided clear evidence of the for- mation of pure SBA-15, and showed that SBA-15 mesoporous molecular sieve particles formed a â€œspike-likeâ€� shape. After enlarging, this showed that many rods of diameter about 1 m were formed in series into a one-dimensional â€œlong ropeâ€� made by accumulation. A former study [39] reported a similar SBA-15 mesoporous molecular sieve particle shape. No large agglomerates of metallic particles were found in the CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst (Fig. 12(b)), suggesting that the Ni, Mo, and CeO 2 were dispersed well in the SBA-15 mo- lecular sieve. The observed uniform pore diameter and thick wall of the SBA-15 molecular sieve suggested an excellent dispersion function for the loaded Ni, Mo, and CeO 2 . The results showed the morphology of the SBA-15 molecular sieve was not changed, indicating an excellent hydrothermal stability of the SBA-15 molecular sieve at 800 Â°C after 100 h reaction. However, the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 (Fig.12(c)) catalyst had rela- tively large aggregates of metallic particles, showing a rela- tively poor dispersion of the metal. This result is consistent with the XRD results (Fig. 9(a)). This implied that the CeO 2 strongly affected the chemical properties of the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst. 3 Conclusions Adding CeO 2 to a Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst used for CO 2 re- forming of methane was beneficial. Catalysts with low CeO 2 amounts (up to 2 wt%) showed higher stability than Ni/Mo/ SBA-15 during CO 2 reforming of methane. The addition of CeO 2 helped small metallic Ni particles to be uniformly and stably dispersed on the composite support, and also enhanced the reducibility of the catalysts and adsorption of CO 2 during the reaction. Catalytic tests using CO 2 reforming of methane showed that the CeO 2 /Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalysts had excellent activity and stability compared with the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 cata- lyst. The addition of CeO 2 into the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst further enhanced the catalytic activity and coking resistance of the catalyst. The excellent catalytic activity and stability were attributed to the highly, uniformly and stably dispersed small metallic Ni particles, high reducibility of the Ni oxides and an interaction between metallic Ni particles and the composite oxide support.

Tel: +86-351-6018073; Fax: +86-351-6018466 A Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst was modified with CeO2 and compared with the unmodified catalyst. The catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption, CO2 temperature-programmed desorption, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Both the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and CeO2/Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalysts gave good catalytic activities at atmospheric pressure. The CeO2 impregnated Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst exhibited excellent stability at 800 °C for 100 h on stream, and after the reaction, carbon deposits were not formed on the catalyst. The Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and CeO2/Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalysts had a regular hexagonal mesoporous structure. The nickel species and the Ce-Mo oxide components were all in the SBA-15 mesopores. This prevented carbon deposition and sintering of the nickel species in the CeO2/Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst. 摘要 考察了 CeO2 修饰及未修饰的 Ni/Mo/SBA-15 催化剂在 CH4-CO2 重整上的催化性能并采用 N2 吸脱附、CO2 程序升温脱附、H2 程序升温还原、傅里叶红外光谱、X 射线衍射、扫描电子显微镜和 X 射线光电子能谱对催化剂进行了表征. 结果表明, 在常压, 800 ºC 条件下, 经过 100 h 在线评价后, Ni/Mo/SBA-15 和 CeO2/Ni/Mo/SBA-15 催化剂仍具有高的反应活性和规整的六方介孔结构, 其中 CeO2 修饰的 CeO2/Ni/Mo/SBA-15 催化剂表面没有积炭形成, 表明 CeO2 的加入促进了 Ni 物种在 SBA-15 介孔分子筛表面的分散, 从而阻止了 Ce/Ni/Mo/SBA-15 催化剂上 Ni 的烧结和积炭. Graphical abstract CeO2/Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalysts have good stability in CO2 reforming of methane. The addition of CeO2 into Ni/Mo/SBA-15 enhanced the catalytic activity and coke resistance of the catalyst.

        "dc:description": "A Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst was modified with CeO2 and compared with the unmodified catalyst. The catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption, CO2 temperature-programmed desorption, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Both the Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and CeO2/Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalysts gave good catalytic activities at atmospheric pressure. The CeO2 impregnated Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst exhibited excellent stability at 800 °C for 100 h on stream, and after the reaction, carbon deposits were not formed on the catalyst. The Ni/Mo/SBA-15 and CeO2/Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalysts had a regular hexagonal mesoporous structure. The nickel species and the Ce-Mo oxide components were all in the SBA-15 mesopores. This prevented carbon deposition and sintering of the nickel species in the CeO2/Ni/Mo/SBA-15 catalyst.",
