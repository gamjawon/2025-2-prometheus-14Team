Tel.: +1 502 852 4103; fax: +1 502 852 6355. The catalytic activity of ZIF-8 in the synthesis of styrene carbonate from carbon dioxide and styrene oxide is presented. ZIF-8 crystals displayed catalytic activity even at temperatures as low as 50°C, with styrene carbonate yields as high as ~54% at 100°C. In contrast to many prior-art catalysts, solvents or co-catalysts were not required. Pyridine and ammonia were used as probe molecules to estimate the type and density of acid sites in fresh and reused ZIF-8 catalysts. DRIFT spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine revealed the presence of both Brönsted (B) and Lewis (L) acid sites. The B-sites have nearly vanished in the case of recycled ZIF-8 catalysts. The simultaneous presence of both the acid sites and the nitrogen basic moieties from the imidazole linker in ZIF-8 promoted the adsorption of the CO2 on the solid surface and its further conversion to the cyclic carbonate. The ZIF-8 catalysts could be recycled and reused without significant loss in catalytic activity. Graphical abstract The catalytic activity of ZIF-8 crystals in the synthesis of styrene carbonate from carbon dioxide and styrene oxide is demonstrated. Highlights ► ZIF-8 crystals were active catalysts in the synthesis of styrene carbonate from carbon dioxide and styrene oxide. ► Zn acid sites and nitrogen basic moieties from the imidazole in ZIF-8 promoted the conversion to the cyclic carbonate. ► The ZIF-8 catalysts could be recycled and reused without any significant loss in catalytic activity. Keywords Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks ZIF-8 CO2 conversion Cyclic carbonates Styrene carbonate 1 Introduction Cyclic carbonates are used as green solvents, electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries and as intermediates in the production of polycarbonates [1,2]. Currently, they are manufactured employing the highly toxic phosgene [2]. An alternative and green approach for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates is the insertion reaction of CO2 into an epoxide. In earlier publications [3–13], we had documented, extensively, the catalytic conversion of CO2 to cyclic carbonates over conventional solid catalysts, including zeolites and mesoporous oxides. In particular, it has been found that some of the most active solid catalysts for the conversion of carbon dioxide and styrene oxide into styrene carbonate were those based on mesoporous SBA-15 [8,10]. Other catalysts which have been used for cycloaddition reactions include aluminum and zinc metal complexes [14], dialkyltin methoxide [14,15], organoantimony halides [14,15], phthalocyanines [16], porphyrins [17–19], Schiff bases [20,21] and Mg/Al oxide-based catalysts [22]. Lewis acid sites are known to catalyze the reaction of CO2 with epoxides to give cyclic carbonates and other precursors of polycarbonates [8–10]. It is likely that solids having Lewis acid sites on their surface and exhibiting high CO2 adsorption capacity will have enhanced activity for this cycloaddition reaction. The ZIF-8 framework, displaying large pores of diameter 11.6Å, accessible through apertures of 3.4Å [23–25] is an appealing material to employ as catalyst for CO2 conversion to cyclic carbonates due to a) the presence of Lewis acid sites in its framework (mainly Zn2+) and b) its known high CO2 adsorption capacity due to the presence of basic sites associated with the imidazole nitrogen [24,25]. ZIF-8 is an active catalyst for many reactions including the dehydrogenation of dimethylamine borane [26], transesterification of vegetable oil [27], the Knoevenagel reaction [28], and the Friedel–Crafts acylation [29]. We had, recently, reported the synthesis of chloropropene carbonate from CO2 and an activated olefin, epichlorohydrin [30]. In the present paper we expand the scope of our earlier investigations to include olefins. We report the catalytic performance of ZIF-8 in the synthesis of styrene carbonate from carbon dioxide and styrene oxide. The ZIF-8 crystals displayed significant catalytic activity at temperatures as low as 50°C. They could be recycled and reused with no loss in catalytic activity. The cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides to yield cyclic carbonates over ZIF-8 catalysts has not been reported in the open literature, so far. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation ZIF-8 crystals were prepared as follows: 8mmol of zinc nitrate hexahydrate ([Zn(NO3)2]·6H2O, Fluka, ≥99%) were dissolved in 1.4mol of methanol (Acros Organics, extra dry, water<50ppm). A solution consisting of 64.4mmol of 2-methylimidazole (C4H6N2, Aldrich, 99%) and 1.4mol of methanol was added to the Zn based solution and vigorously stirred for ~8h. Finally, this solution was centrifuged at 3000rpm, and washed thoroughly with methanol. This washing procedure was repeated 3 times. The resultant crystals were dried overnight at 100°C. 2.2 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were collected using a Bruker D8-Discover diffractometer at 40kV and 40mA with Cu Kα radiation. The morphology of the ZIF-8 crystals was determined with a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FEI Nova 600) with an acceleration voltage of 6kV. The surface area and adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements were carried out on a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 porosimeter at 77K using liquid nitrogen as coolant and the samples were degassed at 150°C for 3h before the measurements. The acidic and basic properties of fresh and spent ZIF-8 catalysts were determined using NH3 and CO2 as probe molecules, respectively. In temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD; Micromeritics Auto Chem 2910 instrument), 0.1g of the catalyst was taken in a U-shaped, flow-through, quartz sample tube. Prior to measurements, the catalyst was pretreated in He (30ml/min) at 250°C for 1h. A mixture of NH3 in He (10vol.%) was passed (30ml/min) at 40°C for 1h. The sample was, then, flushed with He (30ml/min) for 1h. TPD measurements were carried out by raising the temperature from 40 to 250°C at a heating rate of 5°C/min. In the temperature-programmed desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2-TPD; Micromeritics Auto Chem 2910 instrument), a mixture of CO2 in He (10vol.%) was passed (30ml/min) over the activated catalyst for 1h at 40°C. The sample was, then, flushed with He (30ml/min) for 1h. The CO2-TPD measurements were carried out in the range of 40 to 250°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min. From the areas of the desorption peaks and from the calibration curves generated prior to the analyses of the catalyst samples, the amount of acidic and basic sites present in the catalysts was determined. In diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectral measurements, the samples were initially activated at 350°C for 1h in a flow of nitrogen. The temperature was brought down to 50°C and pyridine was adsorbed. Then, prior to spectral measurements, any loosely bound pyridine was removed by flushing the sample with nitrogen for 0.5h (spectral resolution=2cm−1, number of scans=400). Difference FTIR spectra were obtained by subtracting the spectrum of the catalyst from that of the sample adsorbed with pyridine. 2.3 Catalytic studies In a typical cycloaddition reaction, 18mmol of styrene oxide and 100mg of ZIF-8 were placed in a 250ml stainless steel high pressure Parr reactor (model 4576A). The reactor was pressurized with CO2 to 7bar, and the reaction was carried out at 50–100°C for 0.5–10h. This composition corresponds to ~0.13mmol Zn, and to a molar ratio of styrene oxide to CO2 of ~3.5–4. After the reaction, the reactor was cooled to room temperature, the unreacted CO2 was vented out, the catalyst was separated by centrifugation, and the products were analyzed by GC–MS (HP 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with 5970 mass selective detector, 30m×0.32mm HP-5 column coated with 5% phenyl polysiloxane stationary phase). The temperature ramp rate during the gas chromatographic analysis was 70–220°C at 15°C/min. 3 Results and discussion The cycloaddition of carbon dioxide to styrene oxide yielded styrene carbonate as the only product at ≤100°C. Polymerization took place when the reaction temperature was above 110–115°C. Controlled blank experiments under our reaction conditions confirmed that the reaction did not proceed to a significant extent in the absence of the ZIF-8 catalyst. Fig. 1a shows the catalytic performance of fresh and samples of recycled ZIF-8 at 80°C and 7bar for 5h. In the recycle experiments, the catalyst, after use in the cycloaddition reaction, was washed with ethanol and acetone, centrifuged and air dried before reuse. It is likely that Lewis acid sites, associated with Zn ions in the ZIF-8 framework play an important role in catalyzing the cycloaddition of carbon dioxide to styrene carbonate. In addition, the presence of basic nitrogen atoms of the imidazole ligand, probably, favors the adsorption and binding of CO2 as well as activation of the carbon–oxygen bonds in CO2. The spent ZIF-8 catalysts were reused in several recycling experiments with no significant loss in catalytic activity (yield to styrene carbonate decreased slightly from ~39.4% (fresh) to ~37% (recycled)). Interestingly, the yield to styrene carbonate correlated with the surface area of the samples (Fig. 1b). The decrease in surface area suggests partial pore blockage of the recycled ZIF-8 by carbonaceous material formed during the reaction. We have observed this phenomenon previously [30]. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the fresh and recycled ZIF-8 catalysts. Both the intensities and positions of the XRD peaks of all catalysts correspond to sodalite structure, which is the typical known topology of ZIF-8 [24], confirming that the structural stability of ZIF-8 is preserved for all recycled catalysts. Fig. 3 shows the morphological features (hexagonal-faceted crystals) of the fresh and recycled ZIF-8 catalysts obtained from scanning electron microscopy. The fresh catalyst (Fig. 3a) and the first recycled catalyst (Fig. 3b) displayed average crystal sizes in the ~200–270nm range. This average size increased, slightly, to ~230–320nm range for the second and third recycled catalysts (Fig. 3c and d). The slight increase in crystal size for the recycled catalysts is likely related to Ostwald ripening and/or recrystallization [31,32]. The basic hexagonal, morphological features of the ZIF-8 catalyst were, however, still preserved in the recycled catalysts. Fig. 4a shows the catalytic performance of ZIF-8 (% yield of styrene carbonate) as a function of temperature. ZIF-8 was catalytically active even at 50°C. Over zeolite-based and mesoporous solid acid catalysts, this reaction usually occurs only at temperatures above 100°C [3–12]. The yield to styrene carbonate increased as temperature was increased, reaching a maximum of ~53.5mol% at 100°C. Even at 100°C, the recycled ZIF-8 catalyst maintained its catalytic activity (~53% for the first recycle). At higher temperatures the yield of styrene carbonate decreased due to its further polymerization. We followed the kinetics of the reaction at 100°C and estimated the reaction rate constant to be ~7.7×10−4 min−1 (Fig. 4b). ZIF-8 is a bi-functional catalyst containing both acidic and basic sites associated with the Lewis acid Zn2+ ions and the basic imidazole groups, respectively. Pyridine and ammonia were used as probe molecules to estimate the type and density of acid sites in fresh and reused ZIF-8 catalysts. DRIFT spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine revealed the presence of both Brönsted (B) and Lewis (L) acid sites (Fig. 5 ). The IR peaks arising from B-sites appeared at 1634–1670 and 1546cm−1 and the peaks from the L-sites appeared at 1575 and 1475–1499cm−1. H-bonded pyridine showed IR peaks at 1590 and 1435cm−1 [8]. The B-sites have nearly vanished in the case of recycled ZIF-8 catalysts. The concentrations of acid and basic sites of fresh and recycled ZIF-8 catalysts were determined using NH3 and CO2 as probe molecules, respectively. Fig. 6 shows the NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD profiles of fresh and recycled (3rd recycled) ZIF-8 catalyst. The TPD peak around 45°C is probably due to the desorption of physically adsorbed NH3. Table 1 summarizes the concentration of acid and basic sites of the fresh and recycled catalysts (3rd recycle). The amount of NH3 adsorbed on fresh ZIF-8 is reduced significantly after the third recycle, indicating a significant decrease in the concentration of acidic sites upon reuse. On the other hand, only a slight decrease in basicity was observed for the recycled catalyst. The slight decrease in activity of the recycled catalysts may suggest that basic sites may play a more relevant role (as compared to acid sites) in catalyzing the conversion of styrene oxide into its carbonate. As mentioned previously, mesoporous SBA-15 phases are one of the most active solid catalysts for the conversion of carbon dioxide and styrene oxide into styrene carbonate. Yields to styrene carbonate as high as ~89% and ~95% for adenine modified Ti-SBA-15 [8] and Al-SBA-15 [10], have been observed respectively. However, the temperature required for achieving these higher yields was 120°C. The ZIF-8 catalysts of the present investigation were active at as low a temperature as 50°C. Other metal organic frameworks have been used as catalysts for the synthesis of styrene carbonate [33–36] and propylene carbonate [37] utilizing CO2. For instance, MOF-5 effectively catalyzed this cycloaddition reaction. However a quaternary ammonium salt was needed to observe high catalytic activity of MOF-5 [31]. Co-MOF-74 [32] and Mg-MOF-74 [33] displayed high yields to styrene carbonate, at relatively high temperature of 100°C. Interestingly, the high CO2 adsorption capacity of Co-MOF-74 and Mg-MOF-74 correlated with the superior observed catalytic performance of these catalysts. The reaction mechanism is expected to be similar to that of the conventional cycloaddition reactions [8]. The epoxide (styrene oxide, in the present case) is activated on the acidic sites and CO2 on the basic sites. The activated CO2 is then inserted into the epoxide ring forming the cyclic carbonate. CO2 adsorption and activation are a crucial step in this cycloaddition reaction. In bimolecular, cycloaddition reactions involving CO2, the concentration of adsorbed CO2 will influence, crucially the rate of the reaction, especially at temperatures above the boiling point of CO2 when physical adsorption of CO2 is not expected to be significant. While Lewis acid sites associated with Zn atoms are needed for catalyzing the reaction, the basic sites, associated with the N atoms of the imidazole rings of ZIF-8 are needed to adsorb the CO2, increase the surface concentration of adsorbed CO2 and, thereby, increase the rate of the cycloaddition reaction. Below 100°C, the concentration of adsorbed styrene oxide, the other reactant in this cycloaddition reaction, is expected to be high. With high concentrations of both the reactants (styrene oxide and CO2) the rates of this bimolecular reaction are high. This is probably, one of the reasons for the high catalytic activity of ZIF-8 even at lower temperatures. ZIF-8 with high CO2 uptake capacity at ambient conditions, large pore size and simultaneous presence of both acidic and basic sites, therefore, is a highly efficient catalyst for the production of cyclic carbonates even at temperatures as low as 50°C. In summary, we have demonstrated the novel catalytic activity of ZIF-8 catalysts in the synthesis of styrene carbonate from carbon dioxide and styrene oxide. In contrast to hitherto known catalysts, ZIF-8 catalysts displayed catalytic activity even at temperatures as low as 50°C. Styrene carbonate yields as high as ~54% at 100°C were observed for the ZIF-8 catalysts. Lewis acid Zn2+ sites and the nitrogen basic moieties from the imidazole linker in the ZIF-8 framework promoted the adsorption of carbon dioxide on the solid surface and its further conversion to the carbonate. The spent ZIF-8 catalysts were reused in several recycling experiments. After a slight initial loss (Fig. 1a), there was no further significant loss in catalytic activity. The slight decrease in the concentration of basic sites for the recycled catalysts and considerable decrease in the concentration of acid sites suggest that both acid and basic sites are relevant in catalyzing the conversion of styrene oxide into its carbonate.
