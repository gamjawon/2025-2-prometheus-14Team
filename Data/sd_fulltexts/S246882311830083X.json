Graphical abstract Carbon supported iron catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, with the same iron loading of ca. 35 wt.%, were prepared by pyrolysis process and incipient wetness impregnation methods. The effect of the preparation methods on the catalyst structure, catalytic properties, and the direct conversion of syngas via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis was investigated. The iron species, iron particle size and iron reducibility depended on the preparation method. The pyrolysis of homogeneous fusion yielded a unique core-shell structure with dispersed iron species embedded in a matrix of porous carbon. The FeOx/AC catalyst obtained by incipient wetness impregnation contained Fe2O3 species after calcination, while the core-shell structured catalyst obtained by pyrolysis process contained Fe3C species after calcination. The results show that the core-shell structure iron-based catalyst had higher extent of carburization and dispersion, which led to higher activity for Fischer-Tropsch reaction than that of other two catalysts obtained by different synthesis methods. Furthermore, the Fe3C@C catalyst promoted by alkali metals (Na, Mg, K, Ca) resulted in the increase of O/P ratio and low carbon olefin selectivity, and the decrease of methane selectivity. Keywords Fischer-Tropsch synthesis Iron Carbon Catalyst preparation 1 Introduction Along with the increased petroleum demand by emerging economics, there is currently worldwide interest in finding alternative feedstocks for fuels, chemicals and materials. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (denoted as FTS) is a well-established catalytic process to produce clean liquid fuels and chemicals from syngas as a versatile intermediate [1–4]. Synthesis gas (syngas) is a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide derived from various non-petroleum carbon resources, such as coal, natural gas or biomass. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis begins with the dissociation of CO and H2 on transient metal surface, and then follows with the hydrogenation and polymerization process [5,6]. Both cobalt and iron-based catalysts are often preferred for industrial process, because of their high activity and selectivity toward hydrocarbons. Iron-based catalyst is more cost-effective and feedstock flexible over Co-based catalyst. The main drawback of iron-based FTS catalysts is the high deactivation rates because of sintering, carbon deposition and iron phases changes. To stabilized iron active phases from sintering, γ-Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2 are often used as supports to disperse Fe particles [1,7,8]. However, these supports have a strong interaction with iron precursors, and form hardly reducible mixed oxides which lead to low activity. Thus, the interaction between active component and support should be carefully adjusted. Due to the favorable chemical inertness, high specific surface area and surface chemistry, carbon supports in the form of activated carbon, carbon spheres, carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibres are often employed as a carrier for iron-based FTS catalysts [9–11]. It has been claimed that iron catalysts supported on carbon have a higher activity as a consequence of higher dispersion and higher olefin selectivity. However, iron catalysts supported on carbon are usually prepared in a multistep process and the active component distribution on the carbon surface is frequently compromised during the calcined and reaction process, especially when high loadings are targeted. Recently, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising precursors for the synthesis of carbon-encapsulated metal nanoparticles, because of their unique structure and textural properties [12–14]. Carbon-encapsulated metal nanoparticles typically have a core-shell nanostructure of iron cores surrounded by a multilayer of carbon shells. Santos et al. have demonstrated that carbon-encapsulated iron carbides nanoparticles were achieved when Basolite F300 is used as a precursor [12]. The optimal dispersion of the active iron carbide phase and unique iron spatial confinement minimize catalyst deactivation, resulting in high active and stable operation. However, these metal organic frameworks constructed out of iron and organic ligands were typically synthesized through a complex and expensive process and therefore not suitable for scale-up. As is well know, the catalyst preparation methods play a major role in catalyst activity and deactivation. In this study, the physical characteristics of various carbon supported iron catalysts obtained by incipient wetness impregnation and one-pot synthesis process are compared and their performance in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is compared with that of a typical Fe-based catalyst. Compared with Fe/C catalysts obtained by impregnation process, the unique iron spatial confinement of Fe@C materials could effectively avoid the iron nanoparticles agglomerations and sintering. Therefore, it is interesting to introduce carbon-encapsulated metal nanoparticles structures as novel carbon support active phase in stable state for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The catalyst synthesis route is shown in Scheme 1 . In the initial process, the precursors melt into a transparent liquid above 160 °C and iron species is homogenously dispersed. When the calcined temperature increased to the 750 °C, the Fe3C@C catalyst of highly dispersed iron carbides nanoparticles in the carbon matrix was obtained. The structure-activity and selectivity relationship of the various carbon supported iron catalysts is also discussed on the basis of characteristic studies. It was suggested that the highly dispersed iron carbides nanoparticles display outstanding Fischer-Tropsch synthesis performance, with high activity and stability. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalysts preparation Synthesis of Fe3C@C catalyst: 3.0 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was mixed with 5.0 g urea and 3.0 g glucose at 160 °C, forming a transplant solution. After drying at 200 °C for 24 h and then calcined at 750 °C for 10 h under N2 atmosphere to carbonize the carbon precursor, black powders were obtained. The as-synthesized catalyst was denoted as Fe3C@C. Synthesis of FeOx/AC catalyst: The activate carbon supported catalyst was obtained by the incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) method. In the IWI method, 3.0 g Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was dissolved into 18.0 cm3 of deionised water. The obtained aqueous solution was added drop-wise to 10.0 g of the active carbon support. The resulting slurry was dried in a rotavaporator at 90 °C for 60 min, and then calcined under nitrogen at 450 °C for 2 h. The as-synthesized sample was denoted as FeOx/AC. For comparison purposes, a commercial iron-based catalyst denoted as FeSi-C has been applied in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Synthesis of alkali on Fe3C@C catalysts: Alkalis were added by wetness impregnation with an aqueous alkali nitrate to obtain an alkali/iron atomic ratio of 2:100. The mixture was re-slurried and spray-dried. The spray-dried powder was calcined at 450 °C for 5 h under N2 atmosphere. The catalysts were denoted as Fe3C@C-M (M = Na, Mg, K, Ca). 2.2 Catalysts characterizations Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a Bruker D8 powder diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation operated at 40 kV and 40 mA and a Vantec-1 detector. The size and morphology of samples were determined using a FEI Tecnai G20 transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 200 kV and SU8000 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a VG Multilab 2000 (VG Inc.) photoelectron spectrometer using Al Kα radiation as the excitation source under vacuum at 2 × 10−6 Pa. All the binding energy (BE) values were calibrated by the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV of the surface adventitious carbon. The Fe content was calculated by elemental analysis (ICP). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a NETZSCH TG 209F3 instrument. About 10 mg of the samples was placed in a ceramic crucible and heated from 30 to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min using air as carrier gas at a flow rate of 50 mL/min. was performed in a Zeton Altamira AMI-200 unit. Prior to the H2-TPR measurements, the sample (0.05 g) was first flushed with Ar (30 mL/min) at 150 °C for 1 h, and then cooled down to 50 °C. Subsequently, 10% H2/Ar (30 mL/min) was passed through the catalyst while the temperature was increased to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, and was held at 800 °C for 30 min. The H2 consumption (thermocouple detector signal) was recorded automatically by a PC. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the samples were obtained at 77 K using a Quantachrome Autosorb-1-C-TCD-MS instrument. Prior to the N2 physisorption experiment, the samples were evacuated and dried at 473 K for 6 h. The specific surface areas were calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model for adsorption data in a relative pressure range from 0.05 to 0.30. The total pore volumes were calculated from the N2 adsorption data at a relative pressure of 0.995. The pore size distributions were estimated from the desorption branches of the isotherms using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. 2.3 Fischer-Tropsch synthesis FTS was performed in a fixed-bed reactor (stainless steel, id = 12 mm). Typically, 0.5 g catalyst was diluted with 5 g of inert SiC particles. Prior to tests, the catalyst was reduced in situ at 350 °C for 3 h in a flowing H2 stream. After reduction, the catalysts were cooled to 100 °C, in flowing H2. Then, the syngas (H2/CO = 1) was introduced. The reaction temperature was then slowly increased to 340 °C, 1 °C/min and the space velocity of syngas was 16 SL h−1 g−1. During the reaction, feed gas and outlet gases H2, CH4, CO, CO2, C2H6, etc., were measured online by using an Agilent Micro GC3000 equipped with molecular sieves, Plot-Q and Al2O3 capillary columns. The wax and water products were collected in a hot trap (423 K), and the oil and water products were collected in a cold trap (271 K). The products were separated into different fractions (wax, oil, and aqueous) for quantification. The wax was dissolved in CS2 and was analyzed using an Agilent 7890 GC equipped with a FID detector and a HT5 column, the oil was analyzed using an Agilent 6890N GC with a FID detector and a HP-5 column, and the aqueous fraction was analyzed using an Agilent 4890 GC equipped with a FID detector and a HP-Innowax column. The product selectivity was calculated based on the carbon mass balance. Furthermore, the olefin/paraffin ratio was calculated from the respective chromatogram peak areas. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of carbon supported iron catalysts The crystallite structures of the iron-based catalysts are examined by XRD and the results are shown in Fig. 1 . Besides the peak indexed to the graphite, all the additional peaks of the FeOx/AC catalyst are indexed to the Fe2O3 phase. When the calcined temperature increase to 750 °C under N2 atmosphere, all the additional peaks of the FeOx/AC catalyst are indexed to the FeO phase (JCPDS 06-0615) and metal Fe (JCPDS 06-0696), shown in Fig. S1. For the core-shell structured Fe3C@C catalyst, apart from the graphite peak mentioned above, the characteristic peaks of Fe3C structure (JCPDS 35-0772) are also observed. The average Fe3C nanoparticles size estimated through the 37.0° peaks using the Scherrer equation is about 13.4 nm, listed in Table S1. XRD pattern of the commercial FeSi-C catalyst shows crystal structures of Fe2O3 and SiO2. The average iron crystalline sizes were determined using the Scherrer formula, listed in Table S1. Note that the average size of Fe3C nanoparticles obtained by the one-pot synthesis is smaller than that of Fe2O3 nanoparticles synthesized by IWI and conventional co-precipitate methods. Moreover, XRD pattern of Fe3C@C catalysts under different calcined temperatures are shown in Fig. S2. The results show that the Fe3C phase has been obtained when the calcined temperature is more than 650 °C. As shown in Fig. 2 a, many nanoparticles in the size of 10–30 nm uniformly attached to carbon matrix are visible. The HRTEM image of Fe3C@C sample clearly shows small Fe3C nanoparticle inside the graphite shell (Fig. 2b), which should correspond to graphite encapsulating Fe3C nanoparticle. One can see that the Fe3C nanoparticle was completely encapsulated by the graphite layers with 6–8 layer thickness. In addition, these nanoparticles exhibit a d spacing of 2.0 Å, in good agreement with the (220) plane of the Fe3C phase. For the FeOx/AC (Fig. 2c) and FeSi-C (Fig. 2b) samples after the calcined process, the Fe2O3 particles are not uniformly dispersed. It can be seen that numerous small Fe3C nanoparticles are uniformly distributed in graphite and carbon layer. The representative SEM image of Fe3C@C sample provides further information on the structure of the encapsulated nanoparticles with high density (Fig. S3). The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of three iron samples are shown in Fig. 3 . The remarkable hysteresis loops of type-IV indicate the mesoporous structure of Fe3C@C and FeSi-C samples. Different from the above two samples, FeOx/AC shows a type I isotherm (a Langmuir-type isotherm), indicating that the characteristic microporous structure of active carbon. Table 1 presented the physical properties of the iron-based catalysts obtained from different methods. As obtained, the FeOx/AC shows the largest BET surface area of 499.9 m2 g−1 due to the microporous structure support. It is noticed that the total pore volume and average pore size of the three iron-based catalysts obtained from different methods are similar. Raman spectroscopy is well-defined to indentify the chemical nature of the carbon support. As shown in Fig. 4 , two Raman bands at 1350 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1 of Fe3C@C catalyst were observed, corresponding to corresponding D-band to the disordered carbon and G-band to the graphitic carbon. The G bond at 1580 cm−1 is due to the perfect graphite sp2 stretching vibration of the carbon atoms, which represents the degree of ordering of carbon. The D bond at 1350 cm−1 is due to breathing vibration of sp2 defected carbon atoms such as pyrolytic graphite or glassy carbon. The bond at 2690 cm−1 is attributed to 2D carbon, which is carbon atoms have phonon double resonance transitions reverse momentum. The intensity of G bond in Fe3C@C catalyst was higher than that of FeOx/AC catalyst. Moreover, a low ID/IG intensity ratio of Fe3C@C catalyst was observed, indicating the degree of graphitization of Fe3C@C catalyst is higher than that of FeOx/AC catalyst. The XPS spectra for the as-synthesized iron-based catalysts were shown in Fig. 5 . In the spectrum, the two peaks of FeSi-C and FeOx/AC catalysts attributing to the binding energy of Fe 2p were observed, indicating the existence of iron oxide species. It is interesting to notice that the intensity of peaks related to iron species decreased in the FeC@C catalyst. This may be due to the iron carbide nanoparticles being encapsulated in carbon shells, which made it difficult to detect iron species peaks in the Fe 2p spectrum [15]. The binding energies of Fe 2p1/2 (720.0 eV) and Fe 2p3/2 (707.1 eV) of Fe3C@C catalyst were assigned to the iron carbide (Fe0) species. The surface content of Fe was examined by high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, shown in Table S2. It is noticed that the surface iron content of Fe3C@C catalyst is only 3%, indicating that the iron carbide nanoparticles were exclusively encapsulated by the carbon layers in the catalysts. 3.2 Characterization of Fe3C@C catalysts doped by alkali metal (K, Na, Mg, Ca) The powder X-ray diffraction patterns for the unpromoted and alkali metal promoted Fe3C@C catalysts are shown in Fig. 6 . As can be seen, the unpromoted and alkali metal promoted Fe3C@C catalysts show similar XRD patterns. Besides the peak of 26° indexed to the graphite, all the additional peaks are indexed to the Fe3C phase. The textural properties of these samples were evaluated by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K and are summarized in Fig. 7 and Table S3. For all samples, type-IV hysteresis loops in the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were observed, indicating the existence of the mesoporous structure of unpromoted and alkali metal promoted Fe3C@C catalysts. Compared with the unpromoted catalyst, the surface area of alkali metal promoted Fe3C@C catalysts increased to 280–310 m2 g−1. The pore volume and the average pore size of alkali metal promoted Fe3C@C catalysts are smaller than that of Fe3C@C catalyst. The reduction behaviors of unpromoted and alkali metal promoted catalysts were investigated by H2-TPR. The reduction profiles for catalysts are presented in Fig. 8 . In the profile of Fe3C@C catalyst, two well-separated H2 consumption peaks can be observed, which is characteristic of the two-step reduction of iron carbide and graphite carbon is vaporized [16]. With the addition of alkali metals, the positions of these peaks shift to higher temperature. These results indicate that the incorporation of alkali metals inhibit the reduction of catalysts. It may be due to the inhibiting effect of alkali metals on the H2 chemisorption adsorption. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectroscopy was carried out to probe the surface elements, and the measured spectra reveal the presence of Fe (Fig. 9 ). It can be seen that all peaks shift to low energy, due to electron transfer, alkali metal donate electron to iron carbide. Moreover, the content of alkali metals is not detected on surface indicating alkali metals were embedded in graphite. 3.3 Fischer-Tropsch synthesis These iron-based catalysts obtained by different preparation methods were tested in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction at 613 K, 1.0 MPa, H2/CO = 1. The catalytic performance over iron-based catalysts obtained by different preparation methods is presented in Table 2 . It can be seen that Fe3C@C catalyst shows higher activity with CO conversion of 73.2% than that of FeOx/AC and FeSi-C catalysts. The selectivity toward long chain (C5 +) hydrocarbons are 20.9% for Fe3C@C catalyst and 46.4% for FeOx/AC, and the selectivity toward short chain olefins (C2–C4 =) are 30.6% and 18.8%, respectively. The H2/CO ratio of 1.0 was chosen in the feeding gas, because it is close to the ratio in syngas produced from coal or biomass [17]. We compared the catalytic activity of these as-synthesized iron-based catalysts by testing their activities in the same reaction setup under the same conditions. The FTY valve of the 35-Fe3C@C catalysts is 2.6*10−4 molCO gFe −1 s−1, much higher than that of FeOx/AC and FeSi-C catalysts. Moreover, the FTY valve of the 35-Fe3C@C catalysts can be even higher to 8.0*10−4 molCO gFe −1 s−1 when GHSV is increased to 60 SL g−1 h−1. The results indicate that the dispersion and phase of active carbide species in the Fe3C@C catalysts are different from that in the FeOx/AC and FeSi-C catalysts, this is agreement with the XRD and XPS results. The time-on-stream evolution of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis for iron-based catalysts obtained by different preparation methods is presented in Fig. 10 . No sign of deactivation was observed during the 70 h reaction. The hydrocarbon product selectivity of the alkali metal promoted Fe3C@C catalysts is shown in Table 3 . It can be seen that the alkali metal enhance the selectivity to olefins. The results also indicate that alkali metals may act to reduce the availability of hydrogen, and thus modify the rate at which hydrogen adds to dissociated carbon monoxide on a catalyst surface [18]. Thus, the CO conversion of the alkali metal promoted Fe3C@C catalysts decreased with the increasing of alkali metal promotion. The addition of the alkali metal, which acted as an electronic donor to iron carbide, resulted in stronger CO adsorption and enhanced CO dissociation, leading to highly stable and active catalysts. In addition, the O/P ratio for C2-4 reached to 7.0 for the alkali metal promoted Fe3C@C catalysts. In the present study, Na was found to be a better promoter for Fe3C@C catalysts compared to the same amount of K, Mg, Ca (mol-based) on the basis of O/P ratio. The Na promoter played a key role in the evolution of the iron carbide catalysts [19]. The morphology of the iron-based catalysts after FTS reaction is shown in Fig. 11 . It can be seen that some small particles of FeSi-C and FeOx/AC catalysts aggregated into larger particles. Subsequent TEM characterizations of the used Fe3C@C catalyst show the morphology of the small Fe3C nanoparticles inside the graphite carbon matrix are essentially unchanged during the 70 h reaction. Due to the core-shell structure, the dispersion and phase of active carbide species in the Fe3C@C catalysts are more stable than that of other iron-based catalysts. 4 Conclusion Carbon supported iron-based catalysts were prepared by pyrolysis process and incipient wetness impregnation methods with the same iron loading (35 wt.%). The pyrolysis process obtained well-dispersed Fe3C nanoparticles in the porous carbon matrix, displaying an intimate contact with Fe and C that facilitates the formation of iron carbides. We discovered that this strategy resulted in a favorable Fe3C@C core-shell structure, which correlated well with the very high activity for Fischer-Tropsch reaction. It is speculated that the differences in the activity of the iron-based catalysts obtained by different methods might be attributed to the different particle phase and size distribution, which would result in a variation in the amount of the different phases present in the catalyst under reaction conditions. The selectivity in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis over the three catalysts were independent of the method of preparation. Moreover, the addition of the alkali metal promoters (M = Na, Mg, Ca, K) were found to decrease the methane selectivity, while increase the low carbon olefin selectivity and shift the product distribution to higher molecular weight hydrocarbons.
