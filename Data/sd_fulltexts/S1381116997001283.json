Keywords: ZSM-5; Aromatization; Molecular traffic control; Pore size distribution ZSM-5 is well known for its remarkable cat- alytic activity for a number of acid catalyzed organic transformations [1,2]. Oae of its well known properties is shape seleclivity and lack of counter diffusional limitation~ in the reac- tions catalyzed by this system [3?..]. This lack of counter diffusional limitations is explained by molecular traffic control mechanism [5,6]. This mechanism can occur in zeolites with more than one type of intersecting pore system. Reactant molecules may enter preferentially through one of the pore systems, while the product diffuse out through the other. Occurrence of reverse molecular traffic control is als0 possible, in which, small product molecule~ diffuse out Corresponding author.

This phenomenon may not be restricted to ZSM-5 system only and in princi- ple can occur in any molecular sieve having two types of intersecting channel systems (channels of different dimensions). It should also be noted, under reaction conditions, depending on the specific system, the molecular traffic control would be expected to act in combination or in addition to other molecular shape selective ef- fects. Molecular traffic control has received support in a variety of reports dealing with aromatic alkylation and Monte Carlo theoretical calculations [8,9]. Van Den Broeke et al. [10] showed that zeolite structure has an influence in mass transfer rates and counter diffusion and the diffusion rates are 5 to 10 times higher in the absence of counter diffusion.

Viswanadham et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 125 (1997) L87-L90 tial adsorption measurements, Pope doubted the occurrence of this effect [11]. However, it was questioned, whether it is possible to prove or disprove a kinetic phenomenon such as molecu- lar traffic control based on adsorption measure- ments [12]. It is known that ZSM-5 crystalline frame- work consists of two types of intersecting chan- nel systems made up of ten membered ring openings [12-14]. One channel system is sinu- soidal and has a cross section of 5.1 5.5 A. The other channel system has 5.3 5.6 A open- ings which run straight and perpendicular to the first system [15]. Investigations by Derouane group [6] suggested that: (1) Linear aliphatic molecules diffuse freely in ZSM-5 framework and can be adsorbed in both the channels. (2) Iso-aliphatic compounds experience steric hindrance effects, which may restrict their diffu- sion in Sinusoidal channel system. (3) Aromatic compounds and methyl substi- tuted aliphatics have a strong preference for diffusion and/or adsorption in the linear ellipti- cal channels. This implies that flat and large molecules prefer to diffuse in wider elliptical channels. The n-heptane aromatization reaction on ZSM-5 catalyst consists of cracking, oligomer- ization, cyclization and other hydrogen transfer reactions. Applying the above mentioned obser- vations of Derouane et al. to the present reac- tion, it is clear that the reactant and/or the olefins formed by primary cracking preferen- tially travel through sinusoidal channels and reach the intersections, where they undergo the above mentioned reactions, whereas, the aro- matics and other bulkier products formed dif- fuse out through linear channels of ZSM-5 cata- lyst. The experimental results that furnished an evidence for molecular traffic control in ZSM-5 during n-heptane aromatization reaction are re- ported here. The n-heptane aromatization reaction was carried out at 500, 10 kg/cm2 pressure with LHSV = 2 h-1 in a microcatalytic reactor con- taining 5 g of the catalyst, which is a mixture of ZSM-5 (4.5 A1/U.C) and alumina in a 60:40 ratio. The synthesis, characterization and activ- ity evaluation methods are described elsewhere [16,17]. Ultra pure nitrogen was used as the carrier gas with N2/HC = 2. With a view to understanding the effect of coke on pore volume and pore size distribution, the fresh H-ZSM-5 catalyst and the H-ZSM-5 catalyst which was 12 h on stream were examined for pore size distribution using argon adsorption and the Hor- vath and Kawazoe method. Both micro and meso pore size distributions were brought onto single display by using the density functional theory. The differential pore volume plot showed two peaks corresponding to sinusoidal channels and straight channels. In the case of used cata- lyst a similar display was also observed, but the integrated areas of the peaks were smaller indi- cating a loss of pore volume due to coke formed during the reaction (Fig. 2). From the data obtained using the density functional theory shown in Table 1, the decrease in the pore volumes and pore areas of the zeolitic as well as non-zeolitic portion were evaluated. The data indicates that the non-zeolitic pore volume de- Table 1 Pore size distribution by density functional theory Properties Fresh catalyst Used catalyst % decrease Volume in pores < 5.62 A 0.0517 cc/g 0.0507 ccg/g 2 Area in pores < 5.6 A 300.66 m2/g 287.2 m2/g 4.4 Total volume in pores < 300 A 0.3213 cc/g 0.2063 cc/g 35.8 Total area in pores < 300 ~, 32.9 m2/g 30.5 m2/g 7.4 Analysis gas: argon at 87.29 K.

It is clear from these results that 98% of the decrease in pore volume is accounted for by the decrease in pore volume of alumina. The surface area decrease is only 7.4% in the case of zeolitic pores indicat- ing that a significant portion of zeolite is not occupied by coke. Fig. 1 shows the display of incremental pore volume versus pore width plots. It can be seen that both micropores and mesopores are brought into the graph using a density functional theory, and undergo signifi- cant changes as a result of coke tbrmation. It is interesting to see that the total pore volume in the zeolite channels is more or le~;s intact. How- ever, the individual pore volumes of the two channels change significantly. In the fresh cata- lyst, the volume of large pore~;, viz straight channels is higher than that of the sinusoidal 0.02 f o.. 0-0l o o J O > 0\"00 0\"04 UJ O 0.02 0-00 FRESH CATALYST USED CATALYST IO i00 PORE WIDTH (ANGSTRCM) Fig. 1.

The change in volume of the two zeolite channels, observed in fresh and used ZSM-5 catalyst, without change in total zeolitic pore volume suggests that, whatever pore volume is lost in one type of pores is transferred to the other. How did this happen? This can be understood by realizing that pore size distributions are evaluated using gas adsorption. The gas adsorption measures the diameter of the pores through which it enters. Therefore, the fresh catalyst, where both the pores are accessible to gas adsorption, gives the real volume of individual channels. The higher pore volume in linear channels compared to those of sinusoidal channels obtained in this study (Fig. 2) is in agreement with earlier re- ports [5,6,18]. In the case of the used catalyst, the pore volume of straight channels is de- creased from 0.029 cc/g (in fresh catalyst) to 0.0095 cc/g (in the used catalyst) with a simul- taneous increase in pore volume of sinusoidal channels from 0.025 cc/g (in the fresh catalyst) to 0.041 cc/g (in the used catalyst). No signifi- L90 N. Viswanadham et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 125 (1997) L87-L90 cant change in total zeolitic pore volume can be seen from Fig. 2. From these observations it is clear that, in the deactivated catalysts, the sinu- soidal channels are predominantly accessible for gas adsorption. This also suggests that the ma- jority of straight channels are blocked by coke. It appears that the total gas enters through sinu- soidal channels and fills up the poremouth- blocked straight channels through intersections and this keeps the total pore volume more or less intact. Guisnet and Magnoux in an excel- lent review discussed the deactivation of MFI zeolites by coke formation with special refer- ence to n-heptane cracking [19,20]. They dis- cussed the fact that deactivation is primarily due to three causes at various stages of deactivation (i) limitation of access of reactant molecules to the active site (ii) blockage of access to the active sties at intersections in which coke molecules are situated and (iii) blockage of access to the sites of the pores in which no coke molecules are present. In our case, since, the total pore volume and area is more or less intact, it appears that these pores are blocked at the pore mouths. Since there is a small (2%) reduction in pore volume a small amount of blockage in the internal structure such as inter- sections cannot be completely ruled out. By similar argument we can say that most of the sinusoidal pores are still open even after deacti- vation. Now, considering the aromatization reaction, the n-heptane reactant molecules and/or the olefins generated from them, enter the zeolite through small sinusoidal pores and these molecules undergo reaction at channel intersec- tions and the aromatics produced preferentially travel through straight channels. Since, these aromatics and other bulkier products are also coke precursors, they can preferentially block these pores. It is also known that most of the pore blockage in ZSM-5 zeolites is likely to occur at or near pore mouths [19]. This pore blockage occurs preferentially in linear chan- nels, which means that large aromatic molecules and other coke precursors prefer to travel in the channels. By a similar argument one can ex- plain why the sinusoidal channels are not blocked. This result, in our opinion, can be taken as evidence for molecular traffic control (MTC) mechanism.
