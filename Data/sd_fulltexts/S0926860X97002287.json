Japan Received 26 March 1997; received in revised form 7 July 1997: accepted 11 July 1997 Abstract The reduction-oxidation of copper ions in Cu-Pd-H3PO4/SiO2 catalysts, active in the direct oxidation of benzene to phenol, was studied by means of electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The isolated and aggregated copper (Il) ions were found to exist on the Cu-Pd-H3PO4/SiO2 catalyst after evacuation at room temperature. A portion of the Cu(II) ions supported on SiO2, isolated Cu(II) ions coordinated with PO3-, was found to be reversible with alternate reduction-oxidation treatments at 200~C. When the ESR results were compared with the formation rates of phenol, the \"reversible\" Cu(II) ions were concluded to be responsible for catalytically active sites. @. 1997 Elsevier Science B,V.

An ESR study on reduction-oxidation properties of copper ions in Cu—Pd—H3PO4/SiO2 catalyst active in direct oxidation of benzene Shin-ichi Sakata Toshihiro Nakai Hidenori Yahiro Masaru Shiotani * Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, Hiroshima University, Higashi-Hiroshima 739, Japan * Corresponding author. Tel.: +81-824-24-7736; Fax: +81-824-24-7736 The reduction-oxidation of copper ions in Cu—Pd—H3PO4/SiO2 catalysts, active in the direct oxidation of benzene to phenol, was studied by means of electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The isolated and aggregated copper (II) ions were found to exist on the Cu—Pd—H3PO4/SiO2 catalyst after evacuation at room temperature. A portion of the Cu(II) ions supported on SiO2, isolated Cu(II) ions coordinated with PO4 3−, was found to be reversible with alternate reduction-oxidation treatments at 200°C. When the ESR results were compared with the formation rates of phenol, the ‘reversible’ Cu(II) ions were concluded to be responsible for catalytically active sites.
