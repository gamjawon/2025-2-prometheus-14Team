The crystal structure of the catalysts, reduction property and surface oxygen desorption and recovery ability of the catalysts were studied by means of XRD, TPR and TPD-MS. Experimental results show that the addition of La203 increases the activity of CuO/T-A1203 for the oxidation reactions of CO and CH4; the addition of La203 promotes the CuO dispersion on y-A1203 which was in the state of non-crystalline CuO and causes the TPR peak of the La203-CuO/y-A1203 catalyst to move to a lower temperature; the addition of La203 has also improves surface oxygen desorption and the recovery ability of the CuO/T-A1203 catalyst.

Introduction Methane is the most stable hydrocarbon and is often used as a model hydrocarbon for activity tests. Carbon monoxide (CO), a product of incomplete combustion or partial oxidation of carbonaceous materials, and relating to oxygen, is also often used as a probe for activity tests.

Since the precious metal oxides are relatively rare and expensive, some transition metal oxide and rare earth oxide catalysts for purifying automotive exhaust have been studied [1,2]. CuO/T-AlzO3 was widely used for the complete oxidation reaction of CO and RH [3,4]. The rare earth oxides La203, CeO2 and Sm203, as catalyst additive components, not only may improve the low temperature activity of the catalyst and the reduction ability for NOX, but may also improve the stability of the catalyst and the supporter. The addition of La203 over precious metal oxide catalysts can restrain phase changes of T-AI203 into ot-A1203 [5], and studies also indicate that the addition of La203 can form surface LaA1203 compounds with A1203, and can stabilize the A1203 structure [6]. In this paper, the effect of the addition of La203 on the CuO/y-A1203 oxidation activity, the reduction property, the surface oxygen desorption and the recovery ability of the catalysts are studied by means of a micro reactor-GC system, XRD, TPR and TPD-MS. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The catalysts were prepared by the impregnation method with Cu(NO3)2 and La(NO3)3 aqueous solutions of the desired concentrations. The supporter was T-A1203, 20-40 mesh, specific surface area 270 m2/g. The catalysts were dried at 120 followed by calcination in an air stream at 500 for 4 h. The catalysts used were 5% LazO3/T-A1203, 12% CuO/T-A1203 and 5% La203- 12% CuOy/-A1203. 2.2. Measurement of oxidation activity of CO and CH4 The oxidation activity of the catalysts was investigated in a normal pressure fixed-bed reactor at a space velocity 10000 h-~ for the oxidation of CO. Reactant components were 4% CO, 17% 02 and 79%N2. The catalyst sample (0.5 ml) was placed in a quartz glass fixed-bed reactor (Q 5 mm), and was activated with an O2 stream at 500 for 0.5 h, then cooled to the proper reaction temperature. The products were analysed by GC and experimental data were calculated by a CR-6A data processing instrument. Reactant components were 3% CH4, 8% 02 and 89% N2 for the oxidation of CH4 at a space velocity 5000 h-1. The other conditions and steps were as mentioned above. The process chart for the activity measurements to CO and CH4 was taken from Ref. [7]. 2.3. H -TPR TPR used the GC method, with a thermal conductivity detector. The sample (5-10 mg) was activated with an 02 stream at 500 for 0.5 h, then cooled to X.-y. Jiang et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 131-141 133 30, after which H2-TPR was conducted. The reduction mixture gases were H2 and N2 (H2 and N2 99.999% purity, 5% H2, with N2 balance). Reduction mixture gases were purified using a 401 deoxidizer and silica gel, flow-rate of H2 and N2 was 18 ml/min (/3 = 20 K/min). 2.4. 02-TPD The TPD-MS equipment was refitted with the GC-MS of type ZHD-OIS [8]. Molecular analyzer inlet, single ion scan, the process of the mass spectrome- try (MS) tester step-up temperature m/e = 32+ 02 signal. Surface oxygen desorption, the sample (100 mg) was activated with an 02 stream at 500 for 0.5 h, cooled to 50, changed into He stream 0.5 h, then was conducted surface oxygen desorption at the flow of He (/3 = 20 K/min). Surface oxygen recovery, the sample (100 mg) was activated with a He stream at 500 for 0.5 h, cooled to 50, this moment, sample surface adsorption oxygen has been completely desorbed, changed into an 02 stream for 0.5 h, cooled to 50, changed into He stream 0.5 h, then conducted surface oxygen recovery (/3 = 20 K/min). 2.5. XRD analysis of crystal phase Measurement of X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was conducted by using a Riggku D/Max-Ill B for analysis of the crystal phase. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. The activity of catalysts for oxidation reaction of CO and CH4 The minimum reaction temperature necessary for a reactant conversion >~ 99% may be used as the activity target for the evaluation of the catalyst. This is called T99%. A higher activity is indicated by a lower value of T99%. It is usually assumed that carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from automotive exhaust are formed as in the following chemical reaction: 1 CO+~-O2 ~ CO2+Q (1) (m) m CnHm + n + --~ O2 --+ nCO2 q'- 7H20 q- Q (2) Studies have shown that the above reaction is evidently affected by the oxygen content of the catalyst. We found that the oxidation activity of catalysts for the oxidation reaction of CO and CH4 decreases in the order: 5% La203- 12% CuO/T-AI203 > 12% CuO/T-AI203 > 5% La203/T-AI203. From Table 134 X.-y.

For the oxidation of CH4, the values of Ts0% and T99% of the 5%LazO3-12%CuO/T-A1203 catalyst decrease by 20 and 30, respectively, compared to the 12% CuO/y- A1203 catalyst. The results are shown in Table 1. Above mentioned results are explained by the XRD patterns in Fig. 1. Five catalyst samples were investigated. The lines (1), (2), (3) and (4) are respec- tively pure CuO, T-A1203, 5%La203/y-A1203 and 12%CuO/y-A1203 with different diffraction peaks and shapes. After mixing La203 and CuO, shown by line (5), it can be seen that the diffraction peaks of crystalline CuO disappear. Refs. [13,14] report that CuO, NiO etc. on the y-A1203 supporter surface exists in both crystalline and non-crystalline forms. The amount of non-crystalline CuO has a threshold limit value which was determined by the properties of the support surface. The threshold limit value on 100 m2 support was 0.11 g 13 14) ~~~(3) El a E] I I I 20 4(1 60 20() Fig. 1. XRD patterns of catalysts. O = CuO; zx = ~-A1203; [] = La203.

Considering the above mentioned literature, we think that the CuO is highly dispersed over y-A1203, and it is shown that the raised activity of LazO3-CuO/T-AI203 catalyst may be related to the existence of highly dispersed non-crystalline CuO over the support. 3.2. BET surface area of catalysts The specific surface area of the catalysts after calcination at various tempera- ture ares shown Table 2. As can be seen from Table 2, the BET surface area of T-AI203 and the catalysts decreases considerably with increasing calcination temperature. The BET surface area of the CuO/T-AI203 catalyst after calcina- tion at 500 decreases by 27.1% compared with 700, and by 66.4% at 900. Upon the addition of La203, the BET surface area of the CuO/T-AI203 catalyst at 900 decreases by only 48.7% compared with 500. The main reason for the BET surface area decrease is that the BET surface area of the support itself decreases. There occurs a solid phase reaction between CuO and T-AI203, which produces a surface spinel structure of CuAI204 [15]. The addition of La203 can restrain the interaction between CuO and y-A1203, and reduce the catalyst's high temperature sintering. 3.3. XRD phase analysis of catalysts From XRD line (1) in Fig. 2, it can be seen that there exists crystalline CuO after calcination at 600 for 4 h, whereas after calcination at 830 for 4 h, the crystalline CuO diffraction peaks disappear, indicating that CuO and y-A1203 have formed a spinel structure of CuA1204 [11]. Upon addition of La203 to the CuO/T-A1203 catalyst, the quantity of CuA1204 phase decreases, indicating that the addition of La203 restrains the formation of CuAI204. The effect of calcination temperature and time on form of CuA1204 phase has been studied by means of XRD. From Fig. 3, it can be seen that after calcination at 830 for 10 min, the catalyst produces diffraction peaks of CuO and CuAI204, which indicates that part of the CuO has formed CuA1204. After calcination at 830 136 X.-y. Jiang et al. /Applied Catalysis A.\" General 150 (1997) 131-141 I I I I 20 40 60 80 9O 20() Fig. 2.

This indicates that an interaction between CuO and y-A1203 has taken place and that there is also a correlation between calcination temperature and time. The catalyst's sintering, which occurred during oxygen desorption at 830, has also been studied by means of XRD. From Fig. 4, it can be seen that CuO diffraction peaks in line (2) become sharper. This indicates that the CuO crystalline grain has grown bigger, which is because with a rise in temperature, a part of CuO sinters. Upon the addition of La203, see line (4), the CuO diffraction peaks become more disperse, indicating that the addition of La203 /x I I I 20 40 60 80 90 20() Fig. 3.

It can be seen from Fig. 5, that the TPR peak area increases from 1.96 cm2 to 2.36 cm2. The reduction ability decreases in the order: 5%La203-12%CuO/y-A1203 > 12%CuO/y-A1203 > 5%LazO3/Y-A1203. The order of catalysts reduction ability increasing is similar to the order of oxidation activity increasing for CO and CH4. It indicates that there is a close relation between catalyst activity increasing and reduction ability. Lin et al. [9] have studied La-Cu catalysts and have found that the addition of La203 stabilizes catalyst surface CuO and makes Cu2+ ion forma- tion easier. Cu2+-O bond energy is lowered, and meanwhile Cu2+ ions also quickly reduce into active Cu+ ions, therefore easily forming a redox cycle of Cu+ to Cu2+ ions. Considering the above mentioned literature, we think that the main reason for the activity increase is that the addition of La203 increases the reduction speed of the catalysts. 3.5. 02-TPD of the La203-CuO/ y-Al203 The theory of adaptability of group structure [10-12] has put forward that catalytic activity is governed by the adaptability of the group structure of the reactant molecule and the oxygen supplying ability of the surface active centers. The oxygen supplying ability is depends on the number of oxygen supplying centers and activity. Active centers of oxidative catalysts from beginning to end are redox cycle reaction course between oxygen supplying and oxygen recovery, namely, oxygen supplying continuously to reactant molecule which had been oxidized, meanwhile, oxygen absorption continuously from outside, makes the reaction can continue. The two cycle course of catalyst surface oxygen supply- ing and oxygen recovery decides commonly activity of oxidative catalyst. The surface oxygen desorption and recovery of catalyst under conditions of non-reac- tion are studied by means of the TPD-MS technique. The determination of the 032+ signal may show the information of surface oxygen desorption and recovery. Fig. 6 shows the O2-TPD spectra of three kinds of catalysts. O2-TPD spectra peak temperature's high and low shows oxygen supplying centers activity; the peak area shows the number of oxygen supplying centers; the quantity of oxygen re-adsorption shows the oxygen recovery ability. From Fig. 6, it can be seen that there are two O2-TPD desorption peaks for the La203/T- A1203 catalyst; peak top temperatures are 540 and 695, respectively; start desorption temperature is 465. For the CuO/y-A1203 catalyst there appear three O2-TPD desorption peaks at the range from 440 to 830; peak top temperature are 500, 620 and 810, respectively; start desorption temperature is 440. After the addition of La203, three O2-TPD desorption peaks appear in the same temperature range, peak top temperatures 480, 605 and 805; start desorption temperature 410. The start desorption temperature decrease of the X.-y.

The results are shown in Table 3. From Fig. 6, it can be clearly seen that there are three apparent O2-TPD feature peaks for loading CuO samples, namely, a, /3 and y desorption oxygen peaks, corresponding to the forms of CuO which are supported over T-A1203. Friedman et al. [4] have put forward that a number of transition y-aluminas appear to have a similar threshold loading for the appearance of crystalline cupric oxide, ~ 4 wt.-% Cu/100 m2/g support surface area. In the dispersed phase, the Cu2ions are predominantly, but not exclusively, in a tetragonally distorted octahedral environment. In addition, at low copper loading (5%) and calcination below 700, copper species are found to be present in 'surface spinel', including dispersed and highly dispersed copper species. The latter has stronger interaction with the support [ 11].

In accordance with above mentioned literature, we think that the a oxygen peak may be the adsorption oxygen peak of the catalyst surface copper species, /3 the decomposition peak of highly dispersed copper species, and y the lattice oxygen peak of copper oxide. Because La203 modifies for T-A1203, La203 occupies a position of T-A1203 distorted octahedral environment, be advanta- geous to the CuO disperses highly over y-A1203 surface, makes oxygen peak areas of line (3) La203-CuO/y-A1203 become bigger than CuO/y-A1203 and La203/Y-A1203 catalysts. The results are shown Fig. 6. In order to explain the correlation, we have also studied the surface oxygen recovery ability of the catalystsThe results are shown Fig. 7. The desorption oxygen quantity in line (3) is more than in line (2), spectra line (2) and (3) being very similar in peak shapeOxygen recovery of La203-CuO/y-A1203 catalyst appears two desorp- tion oxygen peaks, peaks top temperature are respectively 525 and 800, start desorption temperature is 420. La203-CuO/y-A1203 catalyst shows two desorption oxygen peaks, temperature being 512 and 795, respectively, start desorption temperature 415. The addition of La203 makes the start desorption temperature and peak top temperatures move toward lower tempera- tures. The catalyst surface oxygen recovery rate increases clearly (from 57.2 to 67.1%). It shows the addition of La203 promoted the surface oxygen desorption and recovery of CuO/T-A1203 catalyst. The ability of the catalysts' surface oxygen recovery is in the same order as the increase in activity for oxidation of CO and CH4. Thus it is clear that the catalysts' active contribution is mainly the adsorption of oxygen on the catalyst surface that can be recovered after it is desorbed. X.-y.
