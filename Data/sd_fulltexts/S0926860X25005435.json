In the hydrogenation of rosin, Ni-based catalysts exhibit relatively good performance. However, they still have certain drawbacks, particularly low selectivity in the high-temperature decarboxylation and Dihydroabietic acid hydrogenation processes. To address these negative effects, we report a novel method for preparing NiCu catalysts supported on rod-shaped γ-Al2O3 (NiCu/γ-Al2O3). This catalyst demonstrates high catalytic activity and selectivity towards Dihydroabietic acid while effectively reducing decarboxylation during the reaction. Detailed characterizations (XRD, XPS, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, HRTEM) reveal that the catalyst possesses a NiCu alloy phase after reduction, and the introduction of the Cu component facilitates better dispersion of Ni on the catalytic surface. As a result, the dissociation energy barrier of the H - H bond in H2 is optimized, and the distribution of H⁎ on the surface is regulated. The NiCu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst benefits from the high dispersion of metallic Ni, which minimizes the formation of metal clusters and maintains the catalyst's excellent reusability. Even after 10 cycles, the separated catalyst retains high catalytic activity. The scale - up reaction experiments of this catalyst have verified its excellent prospects for industrial applications.

Its composition is complex, primarily consisting of rosin acids (such as abietic acid and pimaric acid), along with small amounts of fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and neutral substances. Rosin is widely applied across various industrial sectors, including the paper industry, paint and coatings industry, electrical industry, and food industry. However, the presence of unsaturated conjugated double bonds in rosin molecules can lead to oxidation in the presence of oxygen, resulting in a decline in performance. Consequently, the modification of rosin has garnered extensive attention [1]. The modification of rosin acids in rosin through methods such as hydrogenation, disproportionation, and polymerization to enhance the stability of rosin has become a widely adopted research strategy. Hydrogenated rosin, as one of the modified products of rosin, involves the catalytic hydrogenation of non-cyclic double bonds in rosin acids, significantly enhancing the stability and antioxidant properties of rosin. Due to its excellent stability, it is widely used in the paper, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries [2]. Due to the tricyclic backbone structure in its molecules, hydrogenation reactions of rosin typically occur under high temperature (200-270°C) and high H2 pressure (6-25MPa) [3,4]. Currently, the catalysts used for the hydrogenation of rosin primarily consist of noble metals (such as Pd, Ru, and Rh), with Pd/C recognized as the optimal catalyst for this process. However, noble metal catalysts share common disadvantages, including high cost and low recyclability. Under high-temperature conditions, the nanoparticles of these catalysts tend to agglomerate, leading to a gradual decrease in catalytic activity over time. As alternatives to noble metal catalysts, various non-noble metal catalysts have been developed, among which nickel-based catalysts have demonstrated excellent performance [5–7]. Supported nickel-based catalysts combine the advantages of inorganic heterogeneous catalysts and metal complex catalysts, exhibiting high catalytic activity, strong selectivity, and good stability [8]. Additionally, due to their low cost and low toxicity, nickel catalysts are widely used in the catalytic field. However, in the industrial production of rosin hydrogenation, it has been observed that monometallic nickel-based catalysts exhibit a slight decarboxylation phenomenon during the hydrogenation process and show poor selectivity for the hydrogenation of Dihydroabietic acid. This has resulted in relatively low quality of hydrogenated rosin produced using nickel-based catalysts. Heterogeneous bimetallic catalysts are widely used in industrial production. Solid catalysts composed of two metal components generally exhibit superior catalytic performance compared to their corresponding monometallic catalysts [9]. The introduction of a second metal into noble metal catalysts has received significant attention. For example, the addition of Re to Pt notably enhances the selectivity for aromatics, while the incorporation of Au into Pd prevents the sintering of Pd particles during the reaction, thereby improving the stability of Pd [10,11]. Although significant research has been conducted on bimetallic catalysts, there remain various interpretations regarding the specific mechanisms of bimetallic synergy. In supported bimetallic catalysts, the complexity of bimetallic nanoparticles leads to different arrangements of metal atoms depending on the synthesis method, resulting in various forms such as metal alloys, metal mixtures, or intermetallic compounds. Specifically, the spatial arrangement of bimetals can create different metal sites, thereby influencing catalytic performance [12]. Therefore, developing efficient nickel-based catalysts for rosin hydrogenation through bimetallic synergistic catalysis is a practical approach, while also aiming for cost-effective nickel-based catalysts is desirable for industrial production. In this paper, we report a method for preparing a rod-shaped γ-Al2O3-supported Ni-Cu catalyst (Ni-Cu/γ-Al2O3). The objective of this study is to synthesize the NiCu alloy catalyst and characterize the catalyst by detailed characterization of XRD, XPS, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, HRTEM, etc. The distribution of active sites of Ni and Cu components on γ-Al2O3 support and their synergistic catalysis were investigated. The path of catalytic hydrogenation of rosin was analyzed, and the reaction conditions of the catalyst were optimized. Hydrogenated rosin with higher hydrogenation degree was obtained. In addition, we also evaluated the catalytic effect and recycling performance of the catalyst. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials Ni (NO3)2·6H2O (AR) was obtained from Cheng Du Chron Chemicals Co., Ltd, TMAH (Tetramethylammonium hydroxide solution, AR) and Pinane (AR,99%) were obtained from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China), CH3OH (AR) and Cu (NO3)2 were obtained from Sinopharm Group Chemical Reagent Co., LTD, Rosin was obtained from Wuzhou Sun Shine Forestry &Chemical Co., Ltd. Of Guangxi. γ-Al2O3 was obtained from Shandong Xunda Chemical Group Co., Ltd. 2.2 Preparation of Ni-Cu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst The Ni-Cu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was synthesized through the method of equal-volume impregnation. The γ-Al2O3 support was dried at 100℃ for 2h in air atmosphere. The desiccative support was then gradually introduced into a mixed aqueous solution of Cu(NO3) and Ni(NO3)·6H2O and stirred for 12hours at 20℃ to obtain Cu2+-Ni2+/γ-Al2O3.Subsequently, it was dried at 100°C for 3hours and calcined at 500°C for 4hours to obtain Cu-Ni oxide/γ-Al2O3, the heating rate is 5℃/min. The loading amount of Ni associated with the carrier was fixed at 10wt%, while the loading amount of Cu species ranged from 0 to 15wt%. Finally, the catalyst precursor was reduced in flowing H2 at 500°C for 4.0hours, the heating rate is 5℃/ min. These catalysts were represented as Ni1Cux/Al2O3 catalysts, where X represents the mass loading amount of Cu. 2.3 Catalyst characterization XRD spectra were performed on Rigaku SmartLab SE to measure the crystalline structure and phase composition. The 2θ of the XRD pattern ranges from 10° to 80° with 0.02° step size. XPS specta were performed on Thermofisher Nexsa to analyze the chemical states and possible interactions between metals. The metal distribution on the catalyst surface was observed by Field emission transmission electron microscope (FEI Tecnai G2 F20).Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), H2 chemisorption (H2-TPD) and NH3 chemisorption (NH3-TPD) were carried out on the Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 equipment to analyze the interaction between the distribution of acid sites and the metal active center on the catalyst surface [13]. 2.4 Catalyst activity evaluation The catalytic performance of catalysts was evaluated in a 25ml high-pressure reactor. Natural rosin was selected as the reactant and terpinene as the solvent. Typically, 1.25g of reactant, 5g of terpinene, and 0.125g of catalyst were loaded into the high-pressure reactor. Prior to the reaction, the reactor was purged with H2 four times to remove air and then pressurized with H2 to 6MPa at room temperature. Subsequently, the reactor was heated to 200-220°C under stirring at 800rpm. The products were analyzed by GC-MS. The product concentrations were determined using peak area normalization method from chromatograms, and reported as relative amounts. Each experiment was conducted at least three times with an error margin less than 5%. The reported results represent the average values of these experiments. The conversion rate and acid value are calculated according to formula (1) and (2). (1) Conversion = 1 − x y × 100 % Where x represents the proportion of abietic acid in the reaction product. The y represents the proportion of abietic acid in the reaction material. (2) Acid value = C×V× 56.11 m Where C is the potassium hydroxide standard solution concentration. The V is the consumption of potassium hydroxide standard solution volume. The m is the mass of the substance to be measured. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Materials characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of catalysts containing single metal Ni, Cu, and different loadings of Cu nitrate on γ-Al2O3 support are shown in Fig. 1A. For a monometallic Ni catalyst, the diffraction peaks should appear at 2θ = 44.5°, 51.8°, and 76.4°, corresponding to the (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes of metallic Ni, respectively [14]. However, those diffraction peaks were not detected in the catalyst. This is likely due to the highly dispersed nature of Ni species on the γ-Al2O3 surface and the masking effect of the diffraction peaks of γ-Al2O3 on those of Ni. Similarly, the diffraction peaks observed at 2θ = 43.3°, 50.5° and 74.1° in the XRD pattern of the Cu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst are clearly attributable to the (111), (200) and (220) crystallographic planes of metallic copper, respectively, confirming the presence of crystalline Cu in its metallic form. Upon reduction at 500°C, the Ni1Cu0.5/γ-Al2O3, Ni1Cu1/γ-Al2O3, and Ni1Cu1.5/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts exhibit a diffraction peak for Cu(111) at 43.7°, which is situated between the Ni(111) and Cu(111) peaks, indicating the formation of NiCu alloy [15]. To investigate the effects of introducing Cu species on the reduction properties of Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts and the interaction between metals, hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was conducted. Within the studied temperature range, the reduction peaks observed are primarily attributed to the reduction of Ni and Cu. As shown in Fig. 1B, the Cu1/γ-Al2O3 catalyst displays two reduction peaks at 185°C and 213°C. These peaks are attributed to the reduction of CuO to metallic Cu, which occurs due to the varying dispersion and agglomeration states of Cu on the catalyst surface. For the Ni1/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, a reduction peak at 443°C is observed, which is primarily associated with the reduction of crystalline NiO. Comparative analysis of the catalysts reveals distinct reduction behaviors, with the reduction of Ni and Cu species being particularly pronounced. Notably, in the Ni1Cu1/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, the reduction temperature of NiO decreases from 443°C to 296°C compared to the Ni1/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. This indicates that the introduction of an appropriate amount of Cu species effectively facilitates the reduction of NiO in the Ni1/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Additionally, compared to the Cu1/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, the presence of Ni species reduces both the number and temperature of the reduction peaks for Cu species [16]. This is attributed to the improved dispersion of Cu species on the support surface, which minimizes the formation of agglomerated CuO and results in a predominance of highly dispersed CuO. These results collectively indicate a close interaction between Ni and Cu species in the γ-Al2O3 support. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping were employed to observe the distribution of metal species on the catalyst surface ( Fig. 2). In the HRTEM images of the Ni1Cu1/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, a lattice spacing of 0.179nm was observed, which closely matches the lattice spacing of the (200) plane in the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure of NiCu alloy (Fig. 2A). This indicates the presence of an alloy state in the Ni1Cu1/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Comparisons among different compositions of Ni1Cux/γ-Al2O3 catalysts show that the amount of introduced Cu species influences the distribution of Ni; 10% Cu introduction effectively promotes the dispersion of Ni on the γ-Al2O3 support, reducing the formation of Ni clusters [17]. Line scan spectra further confirm a uniform distribution of Ni and Cu in space, with both elements showing similar spatial distribution trends on the catalyst surface (Fig. 2L) [18]. According to the XPS spectrogram ( Fig. 3), Ni and Cu elements were investigated. As shown in Fig. 3A, the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 spectra exhibit eight deconvoluted peaks. The analysis is focused on the Ni 2p3/2 region, where the binding energies at 853.77 and 861.28eV are assigned to metallic Ni0 (Ni0 2p3/2) and its associated satellite features, while those at 856.72 and 863.92eV are attributed to Ni2+ 2p3/2, indicating the coexistence of metallic and oxidized nickel species in the sample. For Ni1/γ-Al2O3, a small amount of Ni0 is observed, with most Ni species present in the form of Ni2+, indicating the presence of few active sites of metallic nickel. Comparison among Ni1/γ-Al2O3, Ni1Cu0.5/γ-Al2O3, Ni1Cu1/γ-Al2O3, and Ni1Cu1.5/γ-Al2O3 reveals that the introduction of Cu species gradually lowers the binding energy of Ni0 while increasing that of Cu0, suggesting electron transfer between Ni and Cu and strong electronic interactions between them [16]. In Ni-Cu alloys, the transfer of electrons from Cu to Ni leads to a downward shift of the d-band center of Ni. This change in electronic structure is expected to weaken the adsorption strength of Ni sites for H2 molecules and H⁎ atoms. However, this moderate adsorption environment may bring two key advantages: First, it optimizes the energy barrier for H-H bond dissociation. Although the adsorption is weakened, the energy barrier for H2 dissociation, which is an early transition state reaction, may not increase significantly, or even be maintained due to the optimization of the transition state structure. Second, it reduces the coverage of surface hydrogen (H⁎), avoiding excessive occupation of active sites. This comprehensive regulation of the adsorption, activation, and coverage of hydrogen species provides the possibility of achieving higher hydrogenation selectivity and anti-carbon deposition performance. H2-TPD analysis was conducted to study the adsorption/desorption of H2 on γ-Al2O3 catalysts loaded with Ni and Cu ( Fig. 4A). The adsorption/desorption of H2 on Ni and Cu supported γ-Al2O3 catalysts was analyzed by H2-TPD. We found that a desorption peak appeared at 100℃, which we infer corresponds to weakly chemically adsorbed hydrogen [19]. It may originate from the weak interaction between the OH groups on the support surface and hydrogen or hydrogen species at the metal-support interface. With the loading of metal nanoparticles, some of the pores of the γ-Al2O3 support were blocked, resulting in a decrease in the total specific surface area of the catalyst, and thus the total amount of physically adsorbed hydrogen decreased. In the range of 250-450℃, the 10%Cu/γ-Al2O3 and 10%Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts showed stronger desorption peaks than the support, which was mainly due to the desorption of chemically adsorbed hydrogen on the surface of the metal species [20]. By comparison, we can infer that the desorption peak of Ni is located at 250℃-400℃. However, the single-metal Cu-loaded catalyst showed a distinct desorption peak at 325℃-375℃, which may be due to the fact that the dispersion of single-metal Cu on Al2O3 is much higher than that of the metal Ni, forming smaller and more defective nanoparticles. The low-coordinated sites on these small particles have a strong adsorption effect on hydrogen, thereby raising the desorption temperature. Notably, in the NiCux/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, the desorption of hydrogen in this temperature range was restricted with the introduction of Cu species. This is because NiCu alloys were formed, and the introduction of Cu isolated and diluted the continuous active sites of Ni through geometric effects and modulated the electronic structure of Ni through electronic effects, lowering its d-band center, thereby jointly weakening its adsorption strength for hydrogen [21]. Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) was used to characterize the number of acid sites on the catalyst surface (Fig. 4B). γ-Al2O3 support exhibits abundant weak acid sites. The introduction of Ni species significantly enhances the number of medium-strong acid sites (300°C≤T≤450°C), while the introduction of Cu species predominantly affects weak acid sites (T≤300°C). By controlling the amount of Cu species introduced, Ni1Cu0.5/γ-Al2O3 and Ni1Cu1/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are able to simultaneously enhance weak and medium-strong acid sites. However, excessive introduction of Cu species leads to competitive adsorption between Ni and Cu, causing a reduction in the number of medium-strong acid sites originally influenced by Ni, thereby lowering the overall acidity of the catalyst. 3.2 Catalyst screening The purpose of this study was to develop a novel nickel-based catalyst to replace Pd/C for catalyzing the hydrogenation of rosin to highly hydrogenated rosin. Natural rosin was used as the substrate, and the composition of the reaction products is shown in Table 1. The main products of rosin hydrogenation are Dihydroabietic acid, Tetrahydroabietic acid, and the by-product dehydroabietic acid [23]. In addition to measuring the hydrogenated rosin content, we also determined the acid value of the products to assess decarboxylation. Through analysis of experimental results, it was observed that using a 10% Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, abietic acid and a small portion of Pimaric acid present in natural rosin were completely converted. In contrast, the 10% Cu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst did not exhibit significant catalytic activity, indicating that metallic Ni serves as the active site for the hydrogenation of abietic acid, possessing superior hydrogen dissociation capability. However, comparing the product compositions, it was noted that the content of dehydroabietic acid was lower and minor decarboxylation occurred in the products from the 10% Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst [24]. Conversely, the Ni1Cu1/γ-Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity towards dehydroabietic acid, enabling further hydrogenation of this primary reaction product under identical conditions. Additionally, employing the same synthesis method as Ni1Cu1/γ-Al2O3, Ni1Cux/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with varying Cu nanoparticle loadings were synthesized ( Fig. 5A). It was found that introducing a small amount of Cu did not significantly enhance the catalytic hydrogenation of abietic acid, likely due to insufficient Cu content to induce substantial electron transfer from Ni, thus diminishing the bimetallic synergy. Conversely, higher Cu loadings led to reduced conversion rates of abietic acid, indicating pronounced inhibition of catalytic activity possibly due to excessive Cu coverage over the NiCu alloy active sites [25]. Furthermore, the influence of different supports on NiCu alloy catalysts was compared (Table 1, entries 10-13), revealing good catalytic performance for natural rosin but weaker selective hydrogenation performance towards dehydroabietic acid under the same experimental conditions, accompanied by significant by-product formation. Among the synthesized Ni1Cu1/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, Ni1Cu1/γ-Al2O3 proved to be the optimal catalyst, exhibiting superior catalytic activity and selectivity towards dehydroabietic acid. Fig. 5B illustrates the influence of temperature on product distribution, where conversion rates of abietic acid were 87.2% and 87.8% at reaction temperatures of 180°C and 190°C. At temperatures of 200°C and above, complete conversion (100%) was achieved, with the main products being dehydroabietic acid (34.4%) and Tetrahydroabietic acid (56.4%), alongside a minor amount of dehydrogenated abietic acid (9.1%). Increasing the reaction temperature to 210°C and 220°C, significantly increased the content of dehydrogenated abietic acid to 19.5% and 23.8%. Analysis of the hydrogenation reaction pathway revealed simultaneous hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes: excessive reaction temperatures accelerated dehydrogenation, thereby reducing hydrogenated abietic acid content [26,27]. At lower reaction temperatures, limited activation energy of reactants resulted in slower catalytic reaction rates [28], allowing longer reaction times for dehydrogenation before complete conversion, explaining the higher content of dehydrogenated abietic acid at lower temperatures [29]. Comparative analysis of reaction times showed complete conversion of raw materials by 1.5hours, with subsequent reaction time mainly influencing secondary reactions in the hydrogenation of Tetrahydroabietic acid. Notably, the Ni1Cu1/γ-Al2O3 catalyst did not exhibit catalytic activity towards the hydrogenation of dehydrogenated abietic acid, and prolonging reaction times beyond 2hours did not reduce the relative content of dehydrogenated abietic acid, hence 2hours was chosen as the optimal reaction duration. According to previous reports, H2 pressure significantly influences the hydrogenation of abietic acid. Gradient pressure experiments indicated distinct changes in product distribution with increasing pressure, notably a decrease in dehydrogenated abietic acid content. This suppression was attributed to the inhibitory effect of elevated H2 pressure on dehydrogenation reactions, becoming less pronounced at 6MPa H2 pressure, thus 6MPa was selected as the optimal pressure for the reaction. At the same time, we compared the currently widely used Pd/C catalysts, Raney-Ni and Ni-W-B/NxC@mSiO2, PVP-stabilized Pd and other catalysts in the recent publication ( Fig. 6) [30,31]. We compare the best test data of each catalyst and find that Ni1Cu1/Al2O3 catalyst has higher content of Tetrahydroabietic acid while taking into account high conversion rate. 3.3 Reusability of Ni1Cu1/γ-Al2O3 catalyst The stability of a catalyst is a crucial indicator of its practical value; therefore, we conducted repeatability tests on the Ni1Cu1/γ-Al2O3 catalyst under optimal conditions: a temperature of 200 °C, hydrogen pressure of 6MPa, and a reaction time of 2hours. After each reaction, the catalyst was separated by centrifugation and washed with ethanol, followed by low-temperature drying. This procedure aimed to remove solvents and products adsorbed on the catalyst's surface while preserving the active components of the catalyst. After 10 cycles of testing, the results indicated that during the eleventh cycle, the content of dehydrogenated rosin increased by 10%. This suggests a change in the catalyst's performance, possibly due to alterations in its active components. XRD analysis revealed that after ten cycles ( Fig. 7B), a diffraction peak corresponding to Ni (111) appeared at 2θ = 44.5°, indicating changes in the crystal structure of the Ni species during the reaction. Additionally, an examination of the diffraction peaks showed that the metallic species transitioned from sharp peaks to broader peaks in the XRD spectrum, which further confirms a reduction in metal crystallinity. Therefore, it can be inferred that changes in the crystal structure of the active components due to repeated high-temperature reactions may have led to a decrease in the catalytic activity of the catalyst. To test the stability of the catalyst and the possibility of its industrial application, we conducted an enlarged experiment under the above conditions. We used a 2L high-pressure reactor for the reaction and selected the optimal experimental conditions mentioned above. To be closer to the industrial production environment, we adjusted the ratio of the solvent to the substrate to 1:1. After scale-up reaction cycle five times, the selectivity of Tetrahydroabietic acid was 59.1% and the conversion rate of rosin was 98.9%. The experimental results indicated that the Ni1Cu1/Al2O3 catalyst still demonstrated strong catalytic performance and good recyclability in the amplified experiment. 4 Conclusions In this work, we report a cost-effective and efficient catalyst prepared by introducing metallic Cu into Ni/γ-Al2O3, forming Ni1Cu1/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. This catalyst demonstrates outstanding selectivity towards the hydrogenation of dehydroabietic acid at mild reaction temperatures. Minimal decarboxylation phenomena were observed during the reaction. Under mild conditions (200°C, 6MPa H2) using Ni1Cu1/γ-Al2O3 catalyst with a Ni/Cu molar ratio of 1:1, complete conversion of dehydroabietic acid (a partial constituent of abietic acid) from natural rosin was achieved. Notably, the tetrahydroabietic acid content reached 56.4%, demonstrating a high-quality conversion of rosin. The high catalytic activity and selectivity of the Ni1Cu1/γ-Al2O3 catalyst can be attributed to the incorporation of Cu, which improves the dispersion of Ni on the support and inhibits the tendency of Ni to undergo hydrogen-induced partial dissociation. The NiCu alloy enables efficient catalysis by optimizing the dissociation energy barrier of the H-H bond in H2, thus modulating the surface coverage of H⁎ species on the catalyst. H2-TPD analysis revealed that Ni and Cu loading on γ-Al2O3 modifies hydrogen adsorption/desorption behavior, with NiCu alloy formation weakening hydrogen adsorption strength via geometric and electronic effects. NH3-TPD results indicated that Ni enhances medium-strong acid sites, while Cu mainly influences weak acid sites, and an optimal Ni/Cu ratio simultaneously enhances both types of acidity. As demonstrated above, the Ni1Cu1/γ-Al2O3 catalyst achieves high selectivity in the catalytic hydrogenation of rosin under relatively mild conditions, offering a promising alternative to Pd/C in the catalytic production of hydrogenated rosin.

        "dc:description": "Supported Ni-based catalysts, as a cost-effective and efficient class of non-precious metal catalysts, have been widely applied in the field of catalytic hydrogenation. In the hydrogenation of rosin, Ni-based catalysts exhibit relatively good performance. However, they still have certain drawbacks, particularly low selectivity in the high-temperature decarboxylation and Dihydroabietic acid hydrogenation processes. To address these negative effects, we report a novel method for preparing NiCu catalysts supported on rod-shaped γ-Al2O3 (NiCu/γ-Al2O3). This catalyst demonstrates high catalytic activity and selectivity towards Dihydroabietic acid while effectively reducing decarboxylation during the reaction. Detailed characterizations (XRD, XPS, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, HRTEM) reveal that the catalyst possesses a NiCu alloy phase after reduction, and the introduction of the Cu component facilitates better dispersion of Ni on the catalytic surface. As a result, the dissociation energy barrier of the H - H bond in H2 is optimized, and the distribution of H⁎ on the surface is regulated. The NiCu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst benefits from the high dispersion of metallic Ni, which minimizes the formation of metal clusters and maintains the catalyst's excellent reusability. Even after 10 cycles, the separated catalyst retains high catalytic activity. The scale - up reaction experiments of this catalyst have verified its excellent prospects for industrial applications.",
