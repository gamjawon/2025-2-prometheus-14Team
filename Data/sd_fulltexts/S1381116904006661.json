Three SrTiO3±δ catalysts have been compared. One of them (T3) was prepared by the traditional sol–gel procedure, the other two through the flame hydrolysis (FH) technique, in the presence of either 1.5mol excess of citric acid (sample T2) or 3mol excess of tartaric acid (sample T1) as complexing agent in the precursor solution. All the catalysts possessed the perovskite-like structure, with some SrCO3 as impurity. T1 was more crystalline than the other two samples and showed the most active as catalyst for the flameless combustion of methane. Isolated Ti3+ ions were found in T3 by EPR analysis, while different EPR features were noticed with T1 and T2 and attributed to Ti4+/O3 −. A high concentration of isolated Ti3+ ions was observed with T1, accompanied by Ti4+/O3 − and by other paramagnetic species, probably Ti4+/O− and Sr2+/O−, not observed with the other samples. This difference between the samples T1 and T2, likely connected with the different temperature attained during the FH preparation process with the two different complexing agents, can explain the higher oxidising activity of the T1 sample. Graphical abstract Three SrTiO3±δ catalysts are compared, prepared by either the traditional sol–gel procedure (sample T3) or the recently proposed flame hydrolysis technique (FH) with citric acid (sample T2) or tartaric acid (sample T1) added to the precursor solution. In addition to the common presence of Ti3+, in the FH samples reactive O3 − species form, to which the even more reactive O− ions add, especially in T1, which proved to be the best catalyst. The overall mechanism could then be described as: Keywords SrTiO3 oxidation catalysts Flame Hydrolysis preparation technique ESR Oxygen-centred radicals 1 Introduction Transition metal oxide mixtures with perovskite-like structure are well known materials very active for the catalytic flameless combustion (CFC) of methane. Traditionally they have been prepared from the corresponding oxides through several cycles of high-temperature (950–1100°C) calcination and milling [1], leading to a thermally resistant material, but with a too low surface area (ca. 1m2/g), hence with low catalytic activity. On the other hand, a well-known sol–gel-citrate (SGC) procedure [2] allows to obtain higher surface area (ca. 40m2/g). However, the relatively low final calcination temperature (usually less than 700°C) attained with this procedure leads to a thermally poorly resistant material. Both these properties, thermal stability and high surface area, can be achieved by preparing the material in nano-size particles, calcined at very high temperature. An innovative preparation method of this kind has been recently proposed [3], based on flame-hydrolysis (FH) of an aqueous solution of the precursor salts. However, samples of the same composition, but prepared from different precursors, may present rather different catalytic behaviour, probably connected with some subtle structural difference. In the present work we investigate three catalysts. Two of them (T1 and T2) have been prepared by FH, but from different precursors solution, the third one (T3) was prepared by the SGC technique. The aim was to compare these three samples as catalysts for the CFC of methane and to investigate the influence of the different preparation parameters on their catalytic properties. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalysts preparation A detailed description of the FH apparatus can be found elsewhere [3]. Briefly, a H2/O2 flame is used, in which a clear precursors’ solution is nebulised. The nano-size particles so formed are collected by means of a 10kV electrostatic precipitator. The temperature attained by the flame in the region of the particle formation, measured by means of a Thermovision 900 FLIR systems IR camera in the 2–5μm wavelength range, resulted nearly 1600°C, being by ca. 8% higher for T1 than for T2. The high temperature and low residence time of the reagents in the flame guarantees a relatively high surface area and a very high thermal stability of the material. 2.2 Preparation of the solutions for FH and SGC preparation 2.2.1 FH Five cubic centimetre of titanium iso-propoxide (Aldrich) were dropped under vigorous stirring in 50cm3 of distilled water, to obtain a fresh titanium oxide (TiO2·nH2O) suspension. Three mole excess of tartaric acid (sample T1) or 1.5mol excess of citric acid (sample T2) were added to the solution, in both cases together with ca. 1vol.% of 30wt.% aqueous H2O2 solution, so to obtain the complete dissolution of the solid through complexation. The solution so obtained was mixed with another solution containing the stoichiometric amount of strontium nitrate and tartaric acid (sample T1) or citric acid (sampleT2) in 0.5/1 organic acid/Sr molar ratio, dissolved in the minimum amount of water. The excess water was finally removed in rotavapor, till 100cm3 residual volume [4]. 2.2.2 SGC The same solution used for FH T2 sample has been employed also for the SGC sample (T3). The only difference was the removing of water to dryness in rotavapor, till the formation of the solid. The latter was calcined in flowing air, with increasing temperature by 0.5°C/min up to 250°C, then by 1°C/min up to 950°C, kept for 1h. 2.3 Catalysts characterisation BET specific surface area (BETSSA) and porosity were determined by means of a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument. XRD analysis was carried out by a Philips PW1820 powder diffractometer, using the Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.15418nm). Shape and size of the particles were determined by means of a Cambridge Stereoscan 150 scanning electron microscope (SEM). X-band EPR spectra were collected by means of a Bruker Elexsys instrument, equipped with an ER4102ST standard rectangular cavity and with a cryostatic ancillary apparatus. The magnetic field intensity has been accurately tested by an ER035M Bruker Teslameter accessory and the microwave frequency has been measured by the HP 5340A frequency counter. The Q-band measurements were performed with a Bruker ESP300 E spectrometer equipped with a Q-band bridge and an ER5106QT cavity. The instrumental parameters were: 1mW of microwave power and 1 and 2G modulation amplitude at 97K and room temperature, respectively. The g iso value of a Mn2+ multiplet with a iso(Mn)=76G observed in the sample spectra (g iso =1.9981) was determined in a X-band measurement and employed successively as an internal reference. The EPR spectra have been simulated by the Bruker SimFonia programme. 2.4 Catalytic activity tests for the CFC of methane Activity tests for the CFC of methane have been carried out by means of a bench-scale continuous apparatus. The catalyst (0.2g), pelletised and then ground and sieved to 60–100 mesh particles, was mixed with 1.3g of quartz particles of the same size and loaded into a vertical down-flow tubular quartz reactor, 7mm i.d. The catalyst was kept in the isothermal central part of the reactor by means of quartz wool flocks. The empty parts of the reactor, above and below the catalyst, were filled with quartz beads (10–20 mesh). Reactant gases flow rates were controlled by means of MKS mod. 1259 mass flow regulators. The reactor was heated by an electric furnace, regulated by an Eurotherm mod. 812 TRC. The outlet gas was analysed in line by means of an HP 5890A HWD gas chromatograph, equipped with Porapak Q and MS 5A columns. Before the reaction the catalyst was activated in situ in flowing air (20cm3/min), while increasing temperature by 10°C/min up to 600°C, kept for 1h. The activity tests were carried out by feeding a gas mixture composed of 10cm3/min of 1.04% methane in helium and 10cm3/min of air, while increasing temperature by 2°C/min from 250 up to 650°C. 3 Results 3.1 Catalysts characterisation BETSSA was about 12m2/g for both T1 and T2 samples, and ca. 1m2/g for T3. XRD analysis (Fig. 1 ) showed crystalline SrTiO3±δ perovskitic structure for all the samples, accompanied by some SrCO3 (characteristic reflections of the latter at 2θ =25.17°, 25.80°, 36.53°, 44.08° [5]), present in smaller amounts with T2 and T3 than with T1. Furthermore, T1 was more crystalline than T2 and T3. SEM analysis (Fig. 2 ) showed for any sample, independently of their BETSSA, relatively uniform, nearly spherical particles, 40–100nm in size, often clustered into larger agglomerates, up to 500nm in size. 3.1.1 EPR spectra of sample T1 The X-band EPR spectrum of sample T1 was composed of many features (see Fig. 3 ). A group of six weak and nearly equidistant lines of equal intensity, indicated by (*), belongs to some Mn2+ impurities. Other two lines A1, A2 appear at g =2.067, 2.049, together with a broader feature A3 at g =2.021 which contributes to a complex more intense absorption in the spectral region indicated by C. A feature B adds at higher field values. The last has been interpreted by computer simulation with g // ≅1.982< g ⊥ ≅1.983, after recording it in detail and with several sample batches. Other four weaker lines, indicated with (+), add in this spectral region at ±9 and ±26G from the B line. They have been re-examined by Q-band EPR spectroscopy (vide infra) where they appeared at the same distance from B. Also the A1, A2 and A3 lines have been investigated by Q-band EPR, but they were no more observable at 34GHz (Fig. 4 ). On the contrary, the C band resolved at 97K with Q-band EPR (Fig. 5 ), showing orthorhombic symmetry (g xx =2.008; g yy =2.009; g zz =2.010). A sample oxidation carried out in air at 600°C for 1h halved the intensity of the B line, with respect to the other lines of the EPR spectrum. 3.1.2 EPR spectra of sample T2 The X-band room temperature (RT) EPR spectrum of T2 shows a line absorption C′ around 3500G much narrower than C observed with T1. However, also C′ is composed of more contributions. Indeed, an accurate simulation of X and Q-band signals reveals two contributions at g =2.011 (A4) and at g =2.008. The comparison between the RT and the 97K Q-band tracks shows that at lower temperature A4 tends to saturate. Indeed, this line saturates also at RT with increasing microwave power (not shown). On the contrary, the feature with g =2.008 resolves at 97K into three components at g =2.008, 2.009, 2.010 (Fig. 5), similarly to what reported for C with sample T1, but with spectral intensity by far lower than with the latter. Indeed, the track of T2 has been multiplied by a factor 3 in Fig. 3. Also the B line was present only as a faint trace in the spectrum of T2. In addition to the above signals, two hyperfine sextets (a iso =76 and 85G, respectively) appear in the Q-band RT EPR of T2, due to Mn2+ impurities in two different sites, one of them being coincident with that observed with T1 (Fig. 4). Traces of Mn2+ ions were detectable also with X-band, but only after chemical reduction of the sample, suggesting that T2 was more oxidised than T1. 3.1.3 EPR spectra of sample T3 Finally, the EPR spectrum of T3 showed the pattern due to Mn2+ and a low-intensity B line (Fig. 3), while traces of features similar to A3 and C became detectable at very high instrumental gains only. 3.1.4 EPR spectra after catalytic use All these EPR patterns disappeared after the catalytic use of T1 and T2 for the CFC of methane, indicating that the corresponding paramagnetic species are involved in the catalytic reaction, i.e. that they are surface species. A new low-intensity, featureless spectrum remained only, preventing any reliable attribution to specific species. T3 behaved in part differently from T1 and T2. Indeed, the six Mn2+ lines were still observable, though with a reduced intensity, also after the catalytic use. 3.2 Activity tests for the CFC of methane In-line analysis of the gas out coming from the methane CFC reactor was made every 10min. The results are collected in Fig. 6 as mol% conversion of methane versus temperature. One may see that T1 was more active than T2 and T3. With T1 the reaction light off temperature (LOT) was 255°C and the full conversion temperature (FCT) of the reactant was lower than 650°C. Sample T2 showed LOT=360°C and FCT≅660°C and T3 was even less active than T2. 4 Discussion 4.1 EPR analysis 4.1.1 The B feature The EPR line B (Fig. 3), characterised by S =1/2, g // < g ⊥ < g e =2.002319, can be attributed to Ti3+ paramagnetic ions, investigated since long time by EPR in zeolites, silicalites, titanosilicates and other systems [6–13]. Indeed, it has been calculated that the Ti3+ g values, though strongly dependent on the crystal field, are always lower than g e, the only exception being, possibly, Ti3+ in either a tetragonally compressed tetrahedral or in a trigonally distorted octahedral symmetry (unpaired electron in the d Z 2 orbital, g // ≈ g e). This assignment is supported also by the fact that the intensity of the B line reduces during the sample oxidation, presumably because of the oxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+. Usually Ti3+ ions present anisotropic EPR signals in solid state centres [9,11], their g values strongly depending on the crystal field parameters. Both g // > g ⊥ and g // < g ⊥ cases have been observed [12] with different octahedrally co-ordinated Ti3+ complexes in frozen solution, in the presence of different crystal fields, and a nearly isotropic single EPR feature has been reported [7] with titanium-exchanged zeolites. In particular, values of g lower than g e and g // < g ⊥ can be obtained in a tetrahedral field with tetragonal elongation [14] or in a tetragonally distorted octahedral field [8,9,12–14]. Indeed, in the last case one has: (1) g / / ≈ g e − 8 λ Δ , g ⊥ ≈ g e − 2 λ δ where λ =154cm−1 is the spin–orbit coupling constant, and Δ and δ are the octahedral and tetragonal splitting parameters, respectively (Fig. 7 ): g // < g ⊥ if 4δ > Δ. The experimental g // ≅1.982< g ⊥ ≅1.983 values measured with line B fits this case with δ =15958cm−1 and Δ =60690cm−1. On the opposite, the formulae given for the tetrahedral tetragonally elongated case do not fit the present experimental g values, so that this possibility must be rejected. Furthermore, the assignment of the octahedral configuration to the titanium ion is in agreement with the expected symmetry for the B cation in the ABO3 perovskitic structure. At last, the four lines labelled by (+) in Figs. 3 and 4 can be attributed to Ti3+–Ti3+ dimers in triplet configuration. Indeed, they appear equally spaced in X- and Q-band spectra (and consequently not at the same g values). Therefore, they are due either to electron spin/nuclear spin (hyperfine) or to electron spin/electron spin (fine) interaction. Excluding the hyperfine interaction on the base of their multiplicity and splitting, it is to be concluded that they result from a fine interaction. This multiplet is centred on the signal of the Ti3+ species (g =1.98). Therefore, this triplet state can be attributed to a Ti3+–Ti3+ dimer. In the approximation of pure dipole–dipole magnetic interaction, the half separation D dd between the two outermost lines of the triplet spectrum (26G≅24.0610−4 cm−1) allows to estimate the Ti3+–Ti3+ distance R =10.2Å. This distance does not correspond to the distance between B sites in the perovskitic ABO3 structure. This is not surprising, since only some titanium centres are reduced to the (III) oxidation state, while most of them keep their original (IV) oxidation state. No Δm s =±2 transition has been observed by us, as expected with such a small value of D dd. Indeed, the intensity of such a feature decreases [15] as (D dd/gβB)2. For example, it has been reported [16] that this line appears with binuclear titanium(III) metallocenes only when the two Ti(III) ions, separated by O2C(CH2) n CO2 are not too far from each other, i.e. when n ≤6. Furthermore, this feature was characterised by an intensity decreasing with increasing n and completely disappeared with n =8 (i.e. with a Ti3+–Ti3+ distance rather close to that above calculated by us), though the zero-field splitting was still measurable in the high-field part of the spectrum also in that case. 4.2 The A1–A4 and the C features A1–A4 lines can be attributed to the perpendicular components of different M +/O− species, where M + is Sr2+ or Ti4+. In fact, their g values are comparable to those attributed [17–25] to O− adsorbed on metal oxides. In particular: g ⊥ =2.071, close to that of A1, has been reported for O− on SrO [22], g ⊥ =2.054 has been measured [25] with O−/Li+ and g ⊥ values ranging between 2.016 and 2.045 have been measured for O− adsorbed on Ti4+ centres [19–21,23], not too far from the values here reported for A2–A4. Also the disappearance of these lines from the Q-band spectra confirms their attribution. Indeed, it has been reported [18,25] that, for adsorbed O− species, the g ⊥ feature strongly broadens in Q-band with respect to X-band spectra, so that it can be no more detectable with the former. This is due to the fact that the g ⊥ values of O− are strongly dependent on the crystal field, being (2) g ⊥ = g e + 2 λ Δ E in axial symmetry [17], where [18] λ =0.014eV is the spin–orbit coupling parameter, ΔE is the splitting between the two degenerate energy levels p x 2 , p y 2 and the singly occupied p z 1 (Fig. 8 ). Therefore, ΔE(1)=0.2164eV, ΔE(2)=0.300eV and ΔE(3)=0.782eV can be calculated in correspondence of the three A1, A2 and A3 lines for O− species adsorbed on a Sr2+ site and two different Ti4+ sites, respectively. Analogously, the signal A4, observed with T2 at g =2.011, could be attributed to the g ⊥ component of the spectrum of a O−/Ti4+ pair, with ΔE(T2)=1.75eV. Theoretical calculations would lead to g // values close to g e in these systems [17]. However, it has been reported [17] that this evaluation is not in agreement with the g values measured with O− adsorbed on surfaces. Indeed, the spin–orbit coupling constant of the cation interacting with O− and stabilizing it will also influence its g // value. As a consequence, g // values of O− of 2.0013, 2.006 and even 2.012 have been observed [17] for O−/Mg2+, O−/Mo6+ and O−/W6+, i.e. with the increasing spin–orbit coupling constant of Mg2+, Mo5+ and W5+, respectively. In our case, a spin–orbit coupling constant λ ≅154cm−1 can be attributed to O−/Ti4+, close to that of Ti3+. Therefore, by interpolating the above reported literature values of g // as a function of λ, a g // value of O− between 2.003 and 2.004 can be expected in the present case, contributing to the higher-field part of the C broad feature. Therefore, the fact that no EPR contribution is detectable for these species at g // values closer to g e indicates that they are species interacting with a cation. However, also other paramagnetic species contribute to C. In particular, its g mean value 〈g(C)〉=〈g(C′)〉=2.009, observed with T1 and T2 sample, respectively, is close to that reported [27–29] for O3 −/Ti4+ in irradiated TiO2, in which O3 − can be thermally stable at temperatures up to 130°C [30]. However, the present g tensor is less anisotropic than those reported for pure single-oxides [30], i.e. for relatively dense-packed systems, characterised by a rather low ion conductivity. In the present case, the O3 − ions are located within perovskite-like mixed oxides, i.e. in a much more open structure, allowing higher ion mobility. This could explain the lower anisotropy observed by us along with the correct 〈g〉 value for the O3 − species. Therefore, we have attributed the C′ line and the main contribution to C to adsorbed O3 − species formed through the reaction [17]: O− +O2(g) ↔O3 − O3(g) − +solid+ →[O(3) −−solid+] Also O2 −/Ti4+ could contribute [19–21] to the lower-field part of C, i.e. to the A3 feature. However, the stability of this line would be in contrast with this attribution. All these EPR data of oxygen-based species in T1 and T2 samples are collected in Table 1 . The difference between the g ⊥ (≡g xx = g yy ) values of A1–A4 lines can be related to a different strength of the M + −O− (M + =Ti4+ or Sr2+) interaction. The splitting ΔE increases for adsorption at stronger surface crystal fields, as it occurs for example on higher charge cations, as Ti4+ with respect to Sr2+, yielding lower g ⊥ values. The further decreasing values of g ⊥ (Table 1) for T1 and T2 catalysts shows that at least three different sites would be occupied by O− radicals with T1, whilst only one site, different from the previous three, would be present in T2. By contrast, O− radicals should not form, or should be present only as traces, in T3. The elementary steps involved in the formation of these ions could be [17,26]: solid→solid+ +e− O2(g) +2e− →2O− O− +O2(g) ↔O3 − O− +solid+ →[O−−solid+] where solid+ is either Sr2+ or Ti4+ and the activation of oxygen through the first two (thermodynamically unfavoured) reactions occurs through its adsorption and incorporation into the oxide crystal lattice. Indeed, the experimental results show that the FH preparation technique yields the formation of electron-rich activated oxygen species, likely during the high temperature treatment employed when atmospheric molecular oxygen could react with the electron-rich activated oxide surface [17,25,26]. 4.3 Catalytic activity Sample T3 showed a lower catalytic activity than the other two samples. This could be attributed to its lower BETSSA. However, T1 and T2, though possessing nearly the same BETSSA, are characterised by a different catalytic activity (Fig. 6). Then, this must be attributed to the presence of different species on their surface. Indeed, the main difference between T1 and T2 samples is that O−/Ti4+ is present essentially in the former only, while O3 −/Ti4+ has been observed with both of them. On the other hand, T1 is more active as catalyst, in particular at T <ca. 400°C (Fig. 6). Therefore, the presence of O− species seems crucial for the catalytic activity of the sample, in particular at lower temperature. Indeed, it is well known that both O− and O3 − are reactive towards alkanes [31,32] and alkenes [29,33,34] and that O− is about 100 times more reactive than O3 − [30,34]. The overall oxygen-species-involving mechanism could then be described as: similarly to what reported by Bielanski and Haber [26]. In it the activation of the substrate (CH4) could take place by dissociative chemisorption and further oxidative dehydrogenation, as reported [31] for the reaction of alkanes with surface O− species. O− ions in different sites can contribute differently to the catalytic performance. In fact, the different interaction strength in the couple O−/M+ at each M+ site influences the availability of oxygen species from the catalyst to the reacting substrate and the electronic orbitals energy levels of the reactive O− species. Indeed, the higher electropositivity (i.e. lower charge, vide supra) of Sr2+ with respect to Ti4+, confirmed by the higher g ⊥ values (Table 1 and Eq. (2)) should enhance the basicity of the O− ion, so favouring the catalytic activity through an easier deprotonation of methane and hence its oxidation, as suggested [25] for the Li-doped MgO. Furthermore, the fact that in the catalytically worst of the three samples, i.e. in T3, only Ti3+ is present, confirms that this is not the main catalytic species. In addition, during reaction T1 re-oxidises better than T3. In fact, after catalytic use all the described EPR patterns disappear with T1 only, in which Mn2+ would oxidise to higher oxidation states. This could not be verified with T2, since in it the Mn ionic impurities were in a more oxidised state even before reaction. The best catalysts proved T1 and T2, both prepared by the FH method and possessing a significant surface concentration of Ti4+/O3 −. In addition, a significant amount of Ti4+/O− is present in T1, which results the best catalyst. This difference between T1 and T2 can be attributed only to the difference in their preparation procedure, i.e. to the nature and concentration of the complexing agents in the precursor solution, leading to different temperatures during the FH process, the better catalyst (T1) being prepared at a flame temperature ca. 8% higher than T2. 5 Conclusions The main conclusions one can draw from the present investigation are: (i) perovskite-like mixed oxide catalysts confirm once more to be a class of very versatile materials; (ii) their properties can be tailored in many ways, e.g. by changing preparation method, preparation conditions, nature and composition of precursor materials, final calcination temperature, etc., so to confer them specific catalytic properties; (iii) last, but not least, even apparently negligible differences in a given preparation procedure can afford important differences in physical–chemical characteristics and hence in catalytic properties of the finished material.

        "dc:description": "Three SrTiO3±δ catalysts have been compared. One of them (T3) was prepared by the traditional sol–gel procedure, the other two through the flame hydrolysis (FH) technique, in the presence of either 1.5mol excess of citric acid (sample T2) or 3mol excess of tartaric acid (sample T1) as complexing agent in the precursor solution. All the catalysts possessed the perovskite-like structure, with some SrCO3 as impurity. T1 was more crystalline than the other two samples and showed the most active as catalyst for the flameless combustion of methane. Isolated Ti3+ ions were found in T3 by EPR analysis, while different EPR features were noticed with T1 and T2 and attributed to Ti4+/O3 −. A high concentration of isolated Ti3+ ions was observed with T1, accompanied by Ti4+/O3 − and by other paramagnetic species, probably Ti4+/O− and Sr2+/O−, not observed with the other samples. This difference between the samples T1 and T2, likely connected with the different temperature attained during the FH preparation process with the two different complexing agents, can explain the higher oxidising activity of the T1 sample.",
