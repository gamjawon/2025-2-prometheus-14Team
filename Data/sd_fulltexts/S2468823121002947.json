Unexpectedly, we founded very different catalytic activities of MgO in oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) depending on company that supplied the precursors, which was due to the Ca-related impurities. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of Ca-promoter on the catalytic activity of MgO catalysts. Substituting Ca into the MgO catalysts strongly influenced both the formation of oxygen vacancies and the base properties of surface lattice oxygen (Olat), which are key factors in this reaction. The formed oxygen vacancies resulted in high methane conversion through the facile conversion of methane to methyl radical, whereas Olat with medium basicity played an important role in producing ethylene through the facile dehydrogenation of ethane.

Hence, the conversion of methane (CH4), which is the main component of the shale gas, into high-value chemicals is considered an important process [1–5]. Among the various methane conversion methods, oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to produce ethane and ethylene (C2-hydrocarbons) has attracted research in heterogeneous catalysis. To commercialize OCM, however, the chemical stability of methane and the thermodynamically favorable formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide from methane must be overcome [6–8]. To overcome these issues, many researchers have developed various catalysts, including lanthanide series oxides, Na-W-Mn mixed metal oxides, and alkaline-earth metal oxides, and investigated their active sites in OCM [9–13]. According to previous reports on OCM, Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 is regarded as a high-performance catalyst for the OCM [14–16]. However, the active sites of Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 are not yet clarified owing to their structural complexity [17]. Therefore, there is a need for more fundamental research that is necessary to clarify the catalytically active sites for OCM. Hence, we have investigated the catalytic active sites through relatively simple and clear structures such as perovskite and single-oxide catalysts [18–22]. In this study, we employed various single-oxide catalysts, such as ZnO, CaO, BaO, and MgO to OCM, and MgO yielded interesting results. Magnesium nitrate precursors for MgO were purchased from two different companies (companies A and B), and we labeled the MgO catalysts as MA100 and MB100 according to the companies. Surprisingly, they exhibited different catalytic performances in OCM, even though the catalysts were prepared under exactly the same conditions (Fig. 1 ). The reasons for this variation in the catalytic performance were confirmed through ICP-AES analysis. MA100 catalyst did not retain any metal components, except for Mg, whereas MB100 contained ca. 1 mol% of Ca in all metal components. For this reason, we infer that the Ca content of MB100 caused the difference in the catalytic performance, indicating that Ca plays a role in promoting MgO catalysts in OCM. Accordingly, we prepared a series of MgO catalysts with different content of Ca-promoter to investigate its effects. Then, we employed the catalysts in OCM in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor. Based on the obtained results, we intensively analyzed the role of oxygen vacancy and the base properties of surface lattice oxygen (Olat) on MgO to design a high-performance OCM catalyst. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The MXY catalysts (X = precursor supplying company (A or B), Y = mol% of Mg in metal components, (Mg/(Mg+Ca))×100)) were prepared through a solid-state method with varying loading amounts of the Ca-promoter precursor. For example, MA99 represents that which was prepared using the precursor from company A and the mol% of Mg in all metal components (Mg+Ca) of the prepared catalyst is 99%. Mg(NO3)2•6H2O (ACS reagent, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich (company A) and Extra pure reagent, 98%, Yakuri Pure Chemicals (company B)) and Ca(NO3)2•4H2O were used as the precursors for MgO catalysts and Ca-promoter, respectively. The precursors were thoroughly mixed in an agate mortar. Then, the mixture was calcined at 950°C for 5 h in a muffle furnace to obtain the MXY catalysts. 2.2 Characterization of the catalysts Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was employed to investigate the atomic compositions of the catalysts using an ICPS-8100 spectrometer (Shimadzu). XRD measurements were performed using an X'pert-Pro PANalytical diffractometer (λ = 1.54056 Å) to confirm the crystal structure of the catalysts, and XRD patterns within a 2θ range of 10°−90° were recorded. The base properties of the synthesized catalysts were analyzed by CO2-temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) measurements and the Hammett indicator method. The CO2-TPD was conducted using a BELCAT B (Microtrac MRB, Japan), and 0.05 g of each catalyst was loaded into the quartz reactor of the TPD apparatus. Firstly, it was pretreated at 400 °C for 1 h under helium inflow (30 mL min−1). When cooled to room temperature by helium, 5% CO2 in helium (30 mL min−1) was pulsed into the reactor at room temperature for 40 min to adsorb CO2. Finally, it was purged at room temperature with helium for 30 min to desorb the physically adsorbed CO2. The TPD profiles of the catalysts were recorded from room temperature to 950 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and the desorbed CO2 was detected by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The Hammett indicator method was employed using four Hammett indicators, including bromothymol blue (H_ = 7.3), phenolphthalein (H_ = 9.5), nile blue A (H_ = 10.1), and tropaeolin O (H_ = 11.1), to analyzed the strength of the base sites on the catalysts. These indicators were added to the water to prepare a 1.0 × 10−5 M solution, and then, each catalyst (ca. 0.02 g) was added to the solution (ca. 2 mL). 2.3 Catalytic reaction The OCM reaction was performed in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor. The reactor was heated to 775°C under nitrogen flow, and then, the reactor feed was changed to the reactant flow: CH4:O2:N2 = 3:1:1 (v/v/v). The total flow rate of the reactant feed was set at 20 mL min−1 and the gas hourly space velocity was 10000 h−1. The water vapor produced during the reaction was removed by a cold trap. The produced gas was periodically analyzed using an online gas chromatography system (YL-6500, Younglin, Republic of Korea) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A carboxen-1000 column was used to separate the reaction products. CH4 and C2-hydrocarbons were detected by the FID, and CO and CO2 by the TCD. The catalytic activities were then calculated using Eqs. (1)–(3), and the yield of C2-hydrocarbons was obtained by multiplying the CH4 conversion by the C2 selectivity. To minimize experimental errors, we performed the activity test five times for each catalyst, and used the average values for evaluations.

It was confirmed that MA100, which is the MgO catalyst synthesized with the precursor from company A, is composed of 100 mol% of Mg in all the metal components of the catalyst. Surprisingly, MB100, the MgO catalyst synthesized with the precursor from company B, contained 1 mol% of Ca in all the metal components of the catalyst, even though the catalyst was prepared without an additional Ca source. It implies that Ca-related compounds exist as impurities in the precursor purchased from company B, and this study was triggered by the idea that impurity could affect the catalysis of MgO in OCM. Moreover, we confirmed that the MAY catalysts were successfully prepared with the intended mole fraction of Mg and Ca constituents. Consequently, we assume that Ca present in MB100 resulted in the difference in catalytic performance compared to MA100 (Fig. 1), and it is expected that the MAY catalysts would exhibit different activities in OCM with respect to the Ca content. When Ca was added into the MgO catalysts, the MXY catalysts were expected to experience structural changes. XRD measurements were employed to investigate the structural properties of the MXY catalysts (Fig. 2 ). Using JCPDS cards, we confirmed that the MXY catalysts were successfully prepared [24,25]. Interestingly, peaks that indicate the presence of CaO were not observed in the XRD patterns of the MgO catalysts with small Ca content (MB100, MA100, MA99). However, peaks corresponding to CaO were observed in the catalysts with relatively large Ca content (MA90), and MA0, which was prepared with only Ca precursors, showed only CaO characteristic peaks. It is also noteworthy that the major peaks of MgO at 2θ = 42.96° (200) were gradually shifted towards the left as the Ca content increased. These results show that, in the case of catalysts with small Ca content, Mg in MgO was substituted by Ca according to the addition of the Ca-promoter precursor, whereas phase segregation from the MgO surface in form of CaO was observed when the Ca content of the MgO catalyst increased beyond a certain amount [26–28]. For clear confirmation, we calculated the d-spacing using Bragg's law ( n λ = 2 d s i n θ ). As listed in Table 2 , the values of the d-spacing increased as Ca was added, indicating a successful substitution of Mg by Ca in the prepared catalysts. From the obtained XRD results, we infer that substituting Mg with Ca changes the structural properties of the catalyst surface and the properties of Olat, which greatly influence the catalytic activities in OCM [18,29,34]. Moreover, according to previous studies on metal oxide catalysts for OCM, adding Ca into MgO, could result in structural defects as oxygen vacancies [30–33,35], and the oxygen vacancy could facilitate the conversion of methane to the methyl radical [15,36]. Therefore, it is believed that Ca could serve as a promoter in MgO catalysts for OCM and MAY catalysts exhibit different catalytic activities in OCM with respect to the Ca content. 3.2 Base properties of MAY catalysts When Mg in MgO is substituted to Ca by adding a Ca-promoter, the electronic properties of Olat bounded to metals, that is the base properties of Olat, are expected to greatly change [35,37–39]. It is well-known that Olat is responsible for the active sites that determine catalytic activities in OCM [18,29,34]. Moreover, according to previous studies on catalysts for OCM, the catalytic activities in OCM have considerable relationships with the basicity of Olat [40]. Hence, we infer that the difference in the activity of MXY catalysts could be explained by investigating the base properties of Olat in the catalysts. Thus, we analyzed the base properties of Olat using CO2-TPD and the profiles are presented in Fig. 3 . Herein, we divided the regions into three, according to the ranges of temperatures for CO2 desorption, and the regions were designated as weak base site (35 °C−200 °C), medium base site (200 °C−400 °C), and strong base site (400 °C−800 °C). In addition, we calculated the number of base sites from the peak areas of each temperature region (Table 3 ). The CO2-TPD profiles of the prepared MAY catalysts were outstandingly different. In detail, the peak temperatures for the CO2 desorption of the catalysts were differently presented, and the peak areas were also different. In the case of MA100, weak and medium sites were observed, but not strong base sites. MA99 showed all the three base sites, and the number of base sites was increased compared to those of MA100. Meanwhile, in the case of MA90 and MA0, both medium- and strong-base sites were observed in their CO2-TPD profiles. Notably, the number of strong-base sites showed an increasing trend, but that of medium-base sites showed a volcano-shaped curve with respect to the Ca content in the MXY catalysts. Consequently, we confirmed MA99 contained the largest amounts of Olat with weak and medium basicity and MA0 contained the largest amount of Olat with strong basicity. To further check the basicity of Olat in the MAY catalysts, we employed the Hammett indicator method, using four indicators with different basicity (H_), including bromothymol blue (H_ = 7.3), phenolphthalein (H_ = 9.5), nile blue A (H_ = 10.1), and tropaeolin O (H_ = 11.1). The results are shown in Fig. S1. In particular, the prepared MAY catalysts exhibited a completely different trend of color change. When bromothymol blue and phenolphthalein were used, the colors of the solutions were changed to blue and pink, respectively. This implies that all MAY catalysts had H_ of 9.5 or higher. However, when the nile blue A indicator was used, the color of the solution added MA100 could not completely change to red, whereas that of the other solutions completely changed to red. This shows that the H_ value of MA100 was between 9.5 and 10.1. In addition, in the case of tropaeolin O solution, the solutions added MA99 and MA100 remained their yellow color, meanwhile, that added MA90 and MA0 completely changed to orange. This confirms that the H_ value of MA99 was between 10.1 and 11.1 and that of MA90 and MA0 was 11.1 or higher. Based on the above results, we finally confirmed that the basicity of the MAY catalysts increased in the order of MA100, MA99, and MA90 ≈ MA0. More importantly, the results obtained from the Hammett indicator method are in good agreement with those of the CO2-TPD analysis. Through the CO2-TPD analysis and the Hammett indicator method, we confirmed that the MXY catalysts retained different base properties of Olat, which are expected to strongly affect their catalytic activity in OCM. 3.3 Catalytic activities of MXY catalysts in OCM and property of surface oxygen species As expected, the activity of the MXY catalysts remarkably varied in OCM with respect to the Ca content in OCM (Fig. 4 ). Particularly, the C2 yield over the MAY catalysts showed a volcano-shaped curve with respect to the Ca content in the catalysts. Accordingly, MA100, which was composed of pure MgO, exhibited poor catalytic activities in OCM, whereas MA99 exhibited the highest catalytic performance in terms of C2 yield (ca. 14.1%). Moreover, MB100 and MA99 with similar Ca content exhibited a similar activity. These results indicate that the Ca content of the MXY catalysts is one of the crucial factors that determine their catalytic activities in the reaction. In other words, Ca could serve as a promoter for MgO catalyst in OCM. The methane conversion was remarkably dependent on the Ca content of the MXY catalysts. It is well-known that oxygen in feed gases is adsorbed onto the oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface, and the adsorbed oxygen (Oads) facilitates the conversion of methane to methyl radical, which is subsequently dimerized into C2 compounds [15,41,42]. Thus, considering that the Ca-promoted MgO catalysts exhibited a higher value of CH4 conversion than pure MgO, we could infer that oxygen vacancies are developed as Ca is added to MgO catalysts. The XRD results confirmed that Mg was substituted with an appropriate amount of Ca in the Ca-promoted MgO, and this changed the structural properties of the catalyst surface. In addition, when additives such as Ca are added to MgO, lattice distortion occurs due to the difference in radius between Ca and Mg, and such a distorted lattice possesses abundant defects like oxygen vacancies [30–33,35]. For these reasons, MA99 and MB100, which contained 1 mol% of Ca in all metal components of the prepared catalysts, exhibited the highest value of CH4 conversion owing to their large number of oxygen vacancies. Considerable changes in the CO/CO2 and C2H4/C2H6 ratios according to the Ca content are also noteworthy results. As the Ca content gradually increased, the C2H4/C2H6 ratio showed the same trend as the C2 yield, whereas the CO/CO2 ratio showed the opposite trend. According to previous research, Olat is responsible for converting the C2H6 formed by the dimerization of methyl radicals to C2H4 or COx [15,42]. Considering that the MAY catalysts showed a different selectivity trend, we predict that substituting Mg with Ca in Ca-promoted MgO changes the properties of Olat. In addition, in our previous study, we obtained that electrophilic oxygen species with medium basicity converts C2H6 to C2H4 [40,43], whereas the nucleophilic oxygen species with strong basicity facilitates COx production [23]. Therefore, we presumed that adding an appropriate amount of Ca to the MgO catalyst would enrich Olat with medium basicity, whereas Olat with strong basicity would be developed with excessive Ca content. These results are interestingly consistent with the results of the CO2-TPD analysis and Hammett indicator method. Thus, the catalysts (MB100 and MA99) that contained 1 mol% of Ca in all metal components exhibited high C2H4 selectivity due to their large amount of Olat with medium basicity, which facilitates the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. On the contrary, MA90 and MA0 showed high CO2 selectivity due to their abundant Olat with strong basicity which is well known as a strong oxidant for the production of CO2 from various hydrocarbons [44]. Additionally, considering the CO2 generated over MA100 without Olat with strong basicity and the results of previous studies, we infer that CO2 could also be produced by converting methyl radical to CO2 in subsequent gas-phase reactions [41]. With the relationship between the catalytic activity (methane conversion and product selectivity) and the properties of MAY catalysts, we propose the role of the surface oxygen species (Oads and Olat) in OCM (Scheme 1 ). Oxygen in the gas phase is initially adsorbed on the oxygen vacancies of the catalysts, and subsequently, Oads is generated. The generated Oads converts methane to the methyl radical through a heterogeneous reaction, and subsequently, the formed methyl radicals are dimerized to C2H6 through a homogenous reaction. More importantly, Olat with medium basicity produces C2H4 by converting C2H6 through a facile dehydrogenation of C2H6, and that with strong basicity is responsible for converting C2H6 and CO to CO2. Therefore, we concluded that well-developed oxygen vacancies and abundant Olat with medium basicity are crucial factors to designing efficient and high-performance catalysts for OCM. 4 Conclusions We observed strange phenomena with very different catalytic activities of MgO in oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). The activity varied according to the company supplied the precursors, which is attributed to the Ca-related impurities contained in the precursors. Accordingly, we prepared a series of MAY catalysts (Y = mol% of Mg in metal components, (Mg/(Mg+Ca))×100)) by a solid-state method with varying loading amounts of Ca-promoter and thoroughly investigated the effects of the Ca-promoter on the MgO catalysts. Interestingly, the catalytic performance of the prepared catalysts varied with respect to the added Ca amount. When Mg was substituted by Ca, oxygen vacancies were formed and the base property of the lattice oxygen species (Olat) changed, resulting in a considerably enhanced catalytic activity of the Ca-promoted MgO catalyst. In particular, an appropriate amount of Ca in MgO catalyst makes the structure advantageous for the formation of oxygen vacancies, resulting in high methane conversion through the reaction of the adsorbed oxygen species and methane to produce methyl radical. Moreover, Olat with strong basicity facilitated the total oxidation of CH4 to CO2, whereas that with medium basicity played an important role in producing ethylene through facile dehydrogenation of ethane. Among the tested catalysts, 1 mol% Ca-promoted MgO exhibited the highest C2 yield due to its well-developed oxygen vacancies and abundant Olat with medium basicity. Finally, we conclude that Ca could be one of the efficient promoters for MgO catalysts in OCM through the formation of oxygen vacancies and tuning of base properties of Olat.

        "dc:description": "Unexpectedly, we founded very different catalytic activities of MgO in oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) depending on company that supplied the precursors, which was due to the Ca-related impurities. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of Ca-promoter on the catalytic activity of MgO catalysts. Substituting Ca into the MgO catalysts strongly influenced both the formation of oxygen vacancies and the base properties of surface lattice oxygen (Olat), which are key factors in this reaction. The formed oxygen vacancies resulted in high methane conversion through the facile conversion of methane to methyl radical, whereas Olat with medium basicity played an important role in producing ethylene through the facile dehydrogenation of ethane.",
