Introduction Multicomponent oxidic catalysts are the most efficient ones in the partial oxi- dation of hydrocarbons and organic oxygenates. Different hypotheses have been advanced to explain the enhancement of both catalytic activity and selectivity in those cases [ 1 ]. They include the change of morphology under the conditions of the catalytic reaction [ 2 ], the interaction between phases [ 3 ] and the remote control process [4] which is due to the spill over of activated oxygen from one oxidic * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/96/$15.00 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the case of the partial oxidation of acrolein to acrylic acid typical catalysts contain vanadium, molybdenum, tungsten and copper [5]. The role of the different elements is still not known even if certain oxidic phases have already been determined by microstructural techniques. However, if one considers oxygen spillover as one of the essential mechanisms in acrolein oxidation the addition of substances known as oxygen donors to the typical multicomponent catalyst should markedly alter the behaviour of the reacting system. Thus the comparison of the reaction kinetics observed in the presence and the absence of oxygen transferring additives should lead to an indication of the underlying mech- anism. For this purpose the kinetics of the oxidation of acrolein have been studied on typical catalysts [ 5 ] and catalysts modified by the addition of 4 different antimon- ates which are considered as oxygen donors: Sb204, CuSb206, CoSb206 and NiSb206. It is the main object of the present paper to give the reaction kinetics modifications due to the addition of such donors and not to detail the physico- chemical characterisation of the different catalysts. 2. Experimental The measurements have been made in a set up schematically represented on Fig. 1 and described in detail elsewhere [6,7]. The integrally operated reactor (length 150 cm, internal diameter 1.5 cm) may be considered as one tube out of a multitubular device which contains the fixed bed of catalyst. The reacting mixture is admitted through thermal mass flow controllers, the concentration of acrolein and water being fixed by loading a stream of air or nitrogen via two saturation- condensation systems operated at constant pressure and temperature. The reactor was made of stainless steel, consisting of 7 different segments with separate electrical heating and with individual temperature control within each segment, and an additional temperature measurement at the end of each segment.

Breiter et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 81-89 83 Heated capillaries were located at the inlet and at the end of each segment, leading to the analytical section where the concentrations of the organic compounds are determined by gaschromatography (capillary column and FID). CO and CO2 are measured by non-dispersive IR-spectrometers and oxygen by a magnetomechanic device. Due to this arrangement the stationary stable concentration profiles along the reactor can be measured. The whole setup is controlled by computer allowing the continuous operation. The reactor can be treated as an isothermal plug-flow system. The catalysts used throughout the study were prepared by coating spherical steatite particles of 4-5 mm diameter with a porous oxidic layer. They are designated by $20 if the layer contains 20% of the total weight and S10 if it is only 10%, the thickness of the shell being 215/xm ($20) and 100/zm (S10) respectively. The composition of the different catalyst layers is as follows: pure multicomponent oxide Mol2V3Wl.2Cu2.2Ox, preparation described else- where ([5], example 1) ($20, S10); pure antimonates ($20); mixtures ( 1:1 by weight) of catalyst Mol2V3Wl.2Cu2.2Ox and the antimonates, the two powdered compounds being mechanically mixed. Sb204 had been obtained by calcination of Sb203 in air at 800. The ternary antimonates were prepared from aqueous solutions of the corresponding salts -- acetate (Cu) or nitrate (Ni, Co) -- dried after addition of powdered Sb203 and calcined at the temperature given above. X-ray diffraction shows that all ternary antimonates contain traces of Sb204. The BET surfaces of the different compounds are given in Table 1, where A designates the multicomponent oxide Mo 12V3W 1.2Cu2.2Ox During all the measurements the total pressure at the reactor inlet was equal to 1.4 bar. The reacting mixture contained 4% acrolein, 5% water at three different oxygen contents (3%, 5.8% or 11%). At two values of the reactor temperature (260 and 300) the GHSV was varied between 400 and 1100 h-'. Table 2 summarizes the different experimental conditions used in the case of various cat- alysts. 3. Results The experimental results may be quantified by the use of 4 parameters as described in detail elsewhere [ 7,8 ]. They are obtained by mass balancing the open system from reactor inlet to the corresponding sampling port z and consist of - the modified residence time tv, z defined by the mass of the catalytically active oxide (not the total catalyst mass) mc,z contained between reactor inlet and port z divided by the volume flow 12 mc.~ (I) tv, z = 84 S.

Their activity was below the detection limit of our device. In all other cases the catalysts showed rather high activities and the grain selectivity to acrylic acid [7] approached one. Typical results are shown on Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 to illustrate the use of the different parameters.

We use such quantitative descriptions of the kinetics to allow safe predictions how the obtainable yield is influenced by the variation of the different parameters of reactor operation (temperature, composition), independently of any physical meaning of the empir- ically determined kinetic coefficients. Due to the fractional order of the parallel reactions r]2 and r13 the comparison of different catalysts makes use of a conversion dependent activity parameter 1 1 k*=t,,(X*) lnl-X* (5) which may be considered as the pseudo first order rate coefficient giving the same acrolein conversion at the same residence time tv at the reactor outlet. Its derivation has been given elsewhere [ 8]. In the following all rate coefficients ko are related to the mass of the catalyst layer and k~ is calculated in the case of X* = 0.99, as the maximum yield is always obtained at conversions near that value. 4. Discussion The reproducibility of the results is of the order of 10% as shown on Table 3 where the values ofk~ are compared in the case of two different fixed beds composed S.

The differences may partly arise from the limited reproducibility of the characteristic length of the catalyst layer even if the use of 260 g of catalyst should somewhat flatten such deviations, they are partly due to the fact that the different coefficients are obtained by curve fitting. In any case the carbon balance is fulfilled to at least 5%. The catalyst activities may show variations up to 30% if different preparations are considered. However, in the present case all antimonate containing catalysts have been prepared from the same sample of catalyst Mol2V3WI.2Cu2.20x. There- 35 ! 30 [ : : \\ .\" ....

Space time yield in the case of the three different catalysts. fore we may consider differences higher than 10% as significant if we compare the relative influence of the different antimonates. This comparison is given exemplar- ily by Fig. 5 where the activity parameter kf is plotted against the antimonate content (in wt.-%) in the case of the $20 type catalysts. As mentioned before, pure antimonates are completely inactive under the con- ditions stated. If they were as inactive in the mixtures with catalyst Mot2V3Wl.2fu2.2Ox, the values should lie on the dotted line. It is evident that this is not the case and the deviations are higher than the 10% considered as significant above. Equally the differences between the antimonates lie beyond the uncertainty of the measurements. In addition, we observe a ranking of the different compounds, NiSb206 being the most active or the less inert among the four oxides considered, which may be influenced by its higher BET surface (cf. Table 1 ). In any case the grain selectivities [7] to acrylic acid were higher than 0.98 at 260 and equal to 1.0 at 300. Weng et al. [9] have shown Sb204 to be a good oxygen donor when tested against MoO3 in the partial oxidation of isobutene to methacrolein, used alone it is completely inactive. In the same way we may consider the different antimonates studied in the present case as oxygen donors: they are inactive if alone but promote the reaction in combination with the multicomponent oxide Mot2V3Wt.2Cu2.2Ox. This leads to the conclusion that this multicomponent oxide must contain at least some oxygen acceptor and gives a confirmation of the working hypotheses announced in the introduction that is spillover of oxygen is at least partly responsible S. Breiter et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 81-89 89 in the mechanism of partial oxidation of acrolein to acrylic acid. The hypothesis has to be confirmed by the study of different oxidic phases contained in catalyst Mot2V3WI.2Cu2.20x. Work in progress is concerned with the microstructural deter- mination of such compounds. In addition, the investigation has revealed an interesting aspect of the use of antimonates in conjunction with catalyst Mo12V3W1.2Cu2.2Ox which is illustrated in Fig. 6. The yield of acrylic acid Yaa has been plotted against the modified space time, calculated as the quotient of total catalyst mass (catalyst support+ catalyst layer, and not as before in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 related to the mass of the catalyst layer alone) in the reactor and volumic flow rate in the case of three different catalysts. The first one, a 20 wt.-% coated catalyst of pure multicomponent oxide Mol2V3Wl.2Cu2.2Ox, shows the highest activity but the maximum yield is limited to 89% due to mass transfer limitation within the active shell. Reducing the char- acteristic length of the catalyst layer (S10) increases the yield up to 95% but it is attained at about twice the space time as the reactor now contains only half the weight of the compound Mol2V3Wl.ECUE.EOx. The use of the same mass of Mol2V3Wl.ECUE.2Ox in conjunction with the same weight of NiSb206 leads to an acceptable compromise ($20, Mol2VaWi.2CUE.EOx-Jt- NiSb206): The maximum yield Ya~ = 95% is obtained at a reasonable space time lying between the values of the two catalysts containing only compound MOlEV3Wl.ECU2.EOx. The addition of Ni2Sb206 leads to the best space time yield.
