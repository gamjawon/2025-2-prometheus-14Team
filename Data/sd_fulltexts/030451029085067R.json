The solvent played a decisive role in the success of the cycloadditions, the best results being observed with CFaCHgOH. Under these conditions, isoprene added to la with a slight para regioselectivity gave a 3:4 mixture of 5-methylcyclohexa-l,4-diene-l-methanol (6) and 4- methylcyclohexa-l,4-diene-l-methanol (7). Introduction Under thermal conditions, propargylic alcohols react only sluggishly in Diels Alder additions [1]. In the presence of strong acids, and if adequate substituted derivatives are used, propargylic <- allenyl cation intermediates might be generated and undergo concurrent [2+2], [4+2] and [4+3] cycloadditions to well-chosen 1,3-dienes [2]. Since the pioneering work of Schrauzer on the Ni-catalyzed cycloadditions of norbomadiene to tolane [3], few examples of transition metal catalyzed [4+2]-cycloadditions of non- activated internal alkynes to 1,3-dienes have been reported thus far [4]. Recently, Matsuda et al. [5] showed that terminal alkynes can add to 2-substituted 1,3-dienes (CHaClg, 100 C) in the presence of a cationic Rh(I) complex. Since the Wilkinson's catalyst (Rh(Ph3P)3Cl) can induce the cyclo- trimerization of alkynes [6], we have explored its potential as a catalyst for the Diels-Alder addition and report here our preliminary results. Results and discussion We have found (Table 1) that the Diels-Alder additions of propargylic alcohol la and its derivatives Ib-e 2,3-dimethylbutadiene (2) are catalyzed *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 60 TABLE 1 Isolated yields of adduct mixtures 3 + 4(+5) for reactions (60 \"C, 2 h) of 1 (0.3 M) +2 (0.45 M) in CFaCHzOH in the presence of 5 mol% R^PheDeCl Dienophile 1 Yield of 3 + 4a t> (a)Ri=Il2=R)=H (b)Ri=Me,R2=R3=H (c)Ri=R2=Me,R3=H (d) Ri = Ra = H, Rg = CHgOH (e) Ri = Me, Ra = H, R3 = CHzCH^Ha 48 38 30 22 64 I:!0 2:3 [7] 3:1 W-'1 <l:10e 12:1:12(6)'' Product ratio determined by 250 MHz ^ NMR of the purified mixture (column chromatography on silica gel, distillation in VMM ).

The corresponding cyclohexa-l,4-dienes 3a-e are obtained together with their didehydrogenated products 4a e, respectively. With hept-6-en-3-yn-2-ol (Ie) only, the [2 + 2]-cycloaddition giving the cyclobutene derivatives 5 (1:1 mixture of two diastereomers) was a competitive process. Complete aromatization of the adduct mixtures could be achieved nearly quantitatively on treatment with a catalytic amount of 5% Pd on charcoal in toluene at 20 C (3h) [7]. When dichlorodicyanobenzoquinone was used for the oxidation, only decomposition was observed. Interestingly, the Pd/C- catalyzed aromatization was not accompanied by double bond migration of the allylic derivative 4e. Noteworthy also was the fact that this thermodyna- mically favoured isomerization does not occur with the Wilkinson's catalyst. In the case of le + 2, no products arising from reaction of the alkene moiety of Ie could be detected. The structures of 3, 4 and 5 were obtained by their spectral data and, in the case of 4a d, by comparison with published data (see references in Table 1). Contrary to the conditions used by Matsuda et al. [5], both terminal (la,b,c) and internal alkynes (ld,e) undergo Diels-Alder additions to 2,3-dimethylbutadiene in the presence of the Wilkinson's catalyst. This 61 catalytic process, however, was limited to propargylic alcohols as we found that the cycloadditions of propargylic acetate, propynoic acid, methyl propynoate, phenylacetylene, pent-1-yne and allylic alcohol did not add to 2 in the presence of Rl^PhaDaCl. The nature of the 1,3-dienes also affects the reactions. For instance, no cycloadditions could be observed with la and cyclopentadiene, cyclohexadiene, furan and 1-substituted butadienes such as piperylene and l-methoxy-3-(trimethylsilyloxy)butadiene. Nevertheless, isoprene (0.5 M) added to la (0.5 M) m CFaCHgOH (60 C, 2 h) afforded a 3:4 mixture of cyclohexa-l,4-dienes 6 and 7 [10] (70%). In this case, only traces of the corresponding benzylic alcohols were formed. la The nature of the solvent plays an important role in the Rh(I)-catalyzed cycloadditions. For instance, no reaction was observed for le + 2 in CHaCN, THF or CHaClz (boiling of the solvents, 2 days). In EtOH, the [4+2]- cycloaddition was much slower than in CFsCHzOH. After 48 h at 80 C, 11% of 8 was isolated as the unique product of cyclocondensation. In MeOH (65 C, 48 h), a mixture of 8 (18%) and 9 (18%) was obtained. In MeOH/HgO 4:1 (65 C, 48 h), 8 and 9 were isolated in 34 and 10% yields, respectively. The reduction of the benzylic alcohol 4e could not be suppressed by addition of 1-phenylethanol to the reaction mixture. EtgN and NaHCOg were found to inhibit the Rh-catalyzed cycloadditions in MeOH. In (CFa)2CHOH (60 C, 48 h), 8 was the unique product isolated in 68% yield; 8 was also formed in CFaCHgOH after prolonged heating (>6 h). OMe 62 The results presented here suggest that other combinations of 1,3- dienes, dienophiles, transition metal complexes and solvents should be explored [11] to force difficult thermal Diels Alder additions to occur. Experimental section For general experimental procedure, see [12]. Hept-6-en-3-yn-2-ol (Ie) But-3-yn-2-ol (10g, 0.142 mol) was added dropwise to a saturated soin. ofNaCI in HgO containing CuCl (1 g) under Ar atmosphere. After heating to 60 C, the pH was adjusted to 7.5-8.5 with 40% aq. NaOH, and allyl chloride (16 g, 0.21 mmol) was added slowly while maintaining the pH between 7.5 and 8.5. After stirring at 60 C for 1 h, the mixture was filtered and extracted with EtgO (30ml, twice). The organic phases were combined, washed successively with sat. aq. NH4C1 solution and HgO, and dried (MgS04). Distillation yielded 13.2 g (84%), colourless liquid, b.p. 58 C/15torr.

Example ofcycloaddition of2,3-dimethylbutadiene (2) to Ie A mixture of Ie (0.66 g, 6 mmol), 2,3-dimethylbutadiene (2, 0.74g, 9 mmol), RhoehaDaCl (0.277g, 0.3 mmol) and CFaCHgOH (20ml) was heated to 60 C under Ar atmosphere for 2 h. The solvent was evaporated and the residue purified by column chromatography on silica gel (150g, EtgO/petroleum ether 1:9), yielding 0.74 g (64%) colourless oil. The 12:1:12 mixture of 3e: 4e: 5 was dissolved in toluene (20ml) and stirred with 5%Pd/C (0.1 g) at 20 C for 3 h. After solvent evaporation, the residue composed of 4e and 5 was separated by bulb-to-bulb distillation in uacuo.
