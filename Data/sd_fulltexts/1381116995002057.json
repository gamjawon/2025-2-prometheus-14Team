Hsin Chu 30043, Taiwan Received 30 May 1995; accepted 5 September 1995 Abstract The autooxidation ofcumene to cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) in the presence of a supported catalyst was inveaiigai^d. When Cu(OAc); was supported on Chelex, polyvinylpyridine or SiO^, it was demonstrated that polyvinylpyridine and Si02 are poor supports for a catalyst in cumene autooxidation. Several metal ions supported on Chelex were tested for their effectiveness in initiating cumene autooxidation at 353 K. The rate of autooxidation follows the order Mn( II) > Cu(II) > Co(II) > Ni(II) > Fe(II). However, Mn(II) gives a poor selectivity to CHP as it can also catalyze the conversion of CHP to 2-phenyl-2- propanol. The most suitable catalyst in the steady propagation ofcumene autooxidation has the composition ofCu(OAc)2 (0.6 mmol) on dried Chelex ( 1.0 g), denoted Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6. There is an optimal ratio ofCu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 to substrate (0.2 g per 10 ml cumene) to achieve an autooxidation rate that is 63% greater than that initiated with CHP at 353 K. The selectivity to CHP is also greater. This ratio is also the best for the rate of initiation in cumene autooxidation to CHP. The lifetime of this catalyst is long; no sign of deactivation was observed in our experiments. Keywora'i: Cumene: Autooxidation; Hydropernxide; Copper acetate; Supported catalyst 1. Introduction The oxidation of hydrocarbons with oxygen or air as oxidant is an important industrial process in the manufacture of commodity chemicals [ 1 ]. This oxidation in the presence of a transition- metal catalyst in both homogeneous and hetero- geneous systems, has been extensively studied [ 2-5 ]. Cumene oxidation is one such important process of oxidation with dioxygen. Cumene is oxidized through a free-radical reaction pathway to cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) which is a pre- cursor to phenol and acetone in the Hock process. In the industrial process, CHP itself serves as ini- tiator [6]. A homogeneous catalyst M(Nf)2 (Nf==naphthenate, M=Zn, Cd) [7] and a het- erogeneous catalyst (Ag, Cu or Pt on support) [ 8 ] do not improve the yield or selectivity to CHP. In most cases, the selectivity to CHP deteriorated in the presence of these catalysts. In this work, we attempted to enhance the rate of autooxidation of cumene using a supported transition-metal catalyst which potential^ pos- sesses the desired advantages of a homogeneous catalyst with high selectivity in mild reaction con- ditions and a heterogeneous catalyst in the ease of isolation of product. We found that a particular combination of metal salt and support can enhance the rate of autooxidation by 63% relative to that * Corresponding author.

Furthermore, the selectivity is also improved with this catalyst. 2. Experimental 2.1. Material and equipment Ion exchange resin Chelex 100, which is a sty- rene divinylbenzene copolymer containing paired iminodiacetate ions, was purchased from Bio- Rad. This resin has a high affinity to metal ions in the + 2 oxidation state. It is not stable above 373 K. Poly-4-vinylpyridine (2% cross linking) and cumene were purchased from Aldrich. Silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh) was obtained from Merck Cumene was purified by repeated reaction with concentrated sulfuric acid until the acid layer was colorless. It was then washed with H20, neutral- ized with sodium carbonate and washed with H^O again. After being dried over MgS04 and refluxed over CaHa, cumene was distilled just before use. 'H NMR spectra were recorded on a Gemini- 300 spectrometer. The metal contents of sup- ported catalyst were measured on a Kontron Plasmakon Model S-35 ICP instrument. IR spec- tra were obtained on a JASCO 300E FTIR spec- trometer. GC analysis were performed on a Shimadzu 8A gas Chromatographie instrument with a flame ionization detector. 2.2. Synthesis of supported catalyst Chelex 100 (which contained about 75% water as purchased) was dried in a vacuum oven at 323 K to a constant mass. The dry Chelex was sus- pended in water and the metal salt to be impreg- nated was then added. After stirring for l h, methanoi was added and stirring was continued for 30 min. After filtering and drying in a vacuum oven, the supported catalyst was obtained. The catalyst is denoted MS-CHX-r, in which MS rep- resents metal salt, CHX represents the Chelex sup- port and r is the amount of metal salt in mmol per gram of support. The procedure of synthesizing the catalyst sup- ported on polyvinylpyridine (PVP) is described below. PVP (1.0 g) was added to a methanoi solution (10 ml) of a metal salt (0.6 mmol). Methanol was added to make the total volume 50 ml. After stirring for 24 h, the catalyst was obtained by filtration, followed by washing with water and acetone, and drying in a vacuum oven. This catalyst is denoted as MS-PVP-0.6. The silica supported catalyst was prepared according to the literature method [9]. The metal content is 0.6 mmol per gram of support. It is denoted MS-S102-0.6. 2.3. Oxidation of cumene Oxidation of cumene was carried out in a closed system made of Pyrex glassware which can be connected to vacuum line and oxygen source by way of stopcocks. The system consists of a water jacketed oxygen reservoir including a condenser, and a 25 ml flask connected to the condenser. The procedure of the oxidation reaction is described below. Cumene ( 10 ml) with catalyst was placed inside the flask, degassed three times by the freeze-pump-thaw cycle. Then oxygen was intro- duced at the desired pressure. The oxidation reactions were carried out between 333-363 K by heating the cumene solution. The temperature of the gas in the small volume between the cumene and the thermostated (298 K) oxygen reservoir (9.11 1) could not be defined. However, this uncertainty was circumvented by a calibration procedure that consisted of measuring before and after the cumene was heated in the absence of catalyst or initiator ( to avoid oxidation). The oxy- gen pressure was monitored with a Alsuryu PT- 15PV pressure transducer interfaced to a PC. Product analyses were performed with both GC and 'H NMR spectroscopy. In GC analysis, iodob- enzene was used as internal standard. At the con- ditions of N3 flow rate 20 ml/min, at 413 K, besides starting cumene, CHP, 2-phenyl-2-pro- panol (PP) and acetophenone (AP) were the only products ever detected on comparison with the retention times of pure samples. In ^ NMR anal- Y.F. Hsu eal. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 105 (1996) 37-144 139 yses, the reaction mixtures (after filtering away the catalyst) were dissolved in CDC13 with inter- nal standard of methanoi for quantitative analysis and TMS for chemical shift measurement. From the methyl region, cumene (01.15 ppm, d), CHP (8 1.49 ppm, s), 2-phenyl-2-propanol (0 1.45 ppm, s) and acetophenone (8 2.30 ppm, s) were identified as the only possible products in the oxi- dation reaction. From the integrated area, by com- parison with that of the internal standard of methanoi, the concentrations of the products were deduced. To measure the amount of CHP accu- rately, a standard iodometric titration method [10] was employed. 120 100 . 60 -) & 40 10 12 3. Results and discussion In the presence or absence of supported catalyst, cumene oxidation by Oz to cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) was investigated by monitoring the O^ pressure, ^(Oz), in a closed system. As shown in Fig. 1, at 353 K , pure cumene is oxidized by Oz only after a long induction period ( h) which is indicative of a free radical reaction pathway. In the presence of CHP, rapid 02 consumption was observed. The Oa consumption slowed at an 0^ 120 100 :\"\". \\ -.. \\ 40 10 20 40 60 30 50 Time (hr) Fig. l.

When fresh Oz was intro- duced into the reaction solution, rapid consump- tion was again observed. This process was repeated several times. When the conversion of cumene was 22%, analysis of the products indi- cated that the selectivity to CHP is 92.1%. The side products were 2-phenyl-2-propanol PP (7.0%) and acetophenone AP (0.9%). 3.1. Support effect When the autooxidation of cumene (10 ml) was carried out in the presence of supported cat- alysts (0.2 g ),Cu(OAc) 2-CHX-0.6,Cu(OAc ) 2- PVP-0.6 or Cu(OAc)2-Si02-0.6, oxygen was consumed as shown in Fig. 2. The relative rates of oxygen consumption for the three catalysts with the same metal content are Cu(OAc)2-PVP-0.6 Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 Cu(OAc)2-SiO,- 0.6. The differences among these catalysts also show in the distributions of products, collected in Table 1. After reaction for 12 h with reaction con- ditions 353 K, cumene ( 10 ml), catalyst (0.2 g), initial 02 pressure (93.3 kPa), the oxidation of cumene catalyzed with Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 resulted in a CHP selectivity of 99.4%, whereas 140 Y.F.

These extra peaks are similar to those of pyridine N-oxide [ 1 1 which is also the most likely oxidation product in this system. Therefore, oxidation of PVP appears to be the major sink of oxygen in Cu(OAc)2-PVP- 0.6 catalyzed autooxidation of cuiiiene. When Cu(OAc)2-Si02-0.6 is the cataly^i, the poor selectivity to CHP is consistent with the literature report [12] that Si02 can catalyze the conversion of CHP to 2-phenyl-2-propanol and acetophen- one. The small catalytic activities and poor selec- tivities toward CHP in cumene autooxidation catalyzed by Cu(OAc)2-PVP-0.6 and Cu(OAc)2-Si02-0.6 indicate that PVP and Si02 cannot serve as suitable supports for the autooxi- dation of cumene to CHP.

With Cu(OAc)2-PVP- 0.6 catalyst, the total number of moles of CHP and PP is only 21% of the number of moles of ^2 reacted. Another oxygen sink was not detected in the products by GC and ^ NMR spectroscopy. IR analysis of the spent and fresh Cu(OAc)2- PVP-0.6 catalyst indicates extra IR peaks in the 3.2. Stability ofCu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 catalyst The life time of Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 catalyst was further tested by repetitive admission of fresh 02. As shown in Fig. 3, in the nrst run, when 02 pressure reached 13.3 kPa, the rate of oxidation slowed down. In the succeeding runs, the slow- down pressure, P increased. However, the rates of oxygen consumption for pressure reaching greater than P, were identical ( 1.91 X 10~5 M/ sec ) except in the first run that included an induc- tion period. At the end of the tenth run, the con- version is 40% with a selectivity to CHP 96% that is less lhan 99.4% for a single run (Table 1 ). On the other hand, this selectivity is much better than that initiated with CHP at 22% conversion (92.1%). When fresh cumene was used in the presence of the spent Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 cata- lyst, exactly the same curves for oxygen con- sumption as in Fig. 3 including the induction period, were obtained. Therefore, the life time of Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 is extremely long. The reac- tion pattern of cumene oxidation in Fig. 3 is very similar to that initiated with CHP in Fig. 1 except the induction period. The effect of catalyst in the induction period and during the steady propaga- tion period warrant further investigation. Y.F.

Effect of metal and temperature on the induction period ofMS-CHX-0.6 catalyzed cumene oxidation Catalysts of various metal salts adsorbed onto Chelex 100 with ihe same of moles per gram of support were investigated under identical reaction conditions 353 K and initial O^ pressure 93.3 kPa. The results appear in Fig. 4. The order of the effectiveness of catalysts in initiating the autoox- idation reaction is: Mn(II) >Cu(II) >Co(II) >Ni(II) >Fe(II) After reaction for 12 h without additional Oz, the product distributions were determined (Table 2). Mn( OAc) 2-CHX-0.6 has a poor selectivity 92.9% to CHP, whereas other catalysts gave a selectivity 99% or over. The poor selectiv- ity of Mn ( OAc ) 2-CHX-0.6 results form its ability to convert CHP to PP that was observed in an experiment in which CHP was mixed with Mn(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 at 353 K followed by prod- uct analysis. According to the rate of initiation and the selectivity to CHP, Cu(OAc)2 supported on Chelex is worthy of further investigation. When activated with varied amounts of Cu( OAc) 2-CHX-0.6, the total amount of oxygen consumed within a reaction period 12 h under identical conditions (353 K, cumene 10 ml and initial 02 pressure 93.3 kPa) varied. As shown in Table 3, a catalyst dose of 0.2 g Cu(OAc)2- CHX-0.6 per 10 ml cumene is optimum. The effect of activation by unit mass of Cu(OAc)2- CHX-0.6, a\\ shown in column 7 in Table 3 is decreasing monotonically with increasing amount of catalyst. To understand the reason for the monotonically decreasing effect on increasing the amount of Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6, Chelex was added to cumene ( 10 ml) with Cu( OAc) 2-CHX-0.6 (0.2 g). The amounts of oxygen consumed, A n (02), in 12 h reaction time at 353 K with initial 02 pressure of 93.3 kPa were 3.83, 2.54, and 1.48 mmol in the presence of Chelex with the amounts 0,0.05 and 0.10 g, respectively. Therefore, Chelex support itself can retard the rate of initiation. The 142 Y.F.

The effect of temperature on the rate of oxida- tion is shown in Fig. 5. As temperature increased, the rate of oxygen consumption increased. The results of product distribution after reaction for 12 h, are summarized in Table 4. Below 353 K, the selectivity was at least 99%. At 363 K, the selec- tivity decreased to 97.3%. 3.4. Rate of cumene oxidation in the steady propagation state This steady propagation rate is a critical param- eter for economic considerations in industrial application. This rate was obtained when fresh Oz was repeatedly admitted to the reaction system until a steady value was attained and maintained. A steady rate was usually reached in the second cycle after the first initiation cycle. A typical example is shown in Fig. 3. Besides Cu(OAc)2- CHX-0.6, catalysts with different metal loading, Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.4 and Cu(OAc)2-CHX-1.0, were also investigated. 1.0 mmol of divalent metal per l g of support is the maximum metal loading for Chelex 100. The steady rates of oxygen con- sumption are given in Table 5. When the amount of Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 increases, the oxygen consumption rate reaches a maximum (0.2 g per 10 ml cumene) then decreases when more Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 is present. This behavior is similar to that observed in the initiation period that there is an optimum amount of catalyst. With varied metal loading, Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 was obviously better than Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.4 and Cu(OAc)2-CHX-LO in terms of per unit amount of Cu(OAc)2. This average optimum rate is 63% greater than the average rate (L12xlO-5Ms-l) when initiated with CHP. 3.5.

Hsu et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 105 {1996) 7-144 143 Initiation: RH->-' (I) ROOH-^RO'+'OH (2) Propagation: R' + 02 -> ROO\" ( 3 ) ROO'+RH->ROOH+'R (4) Termination: 2ROO' -> inactive product ( 5 ) 2R'->R2 (6) R\"+ROO\"->ROOR' (7) Branching: ROOH + R' -> ROH + RO' ( 8 ) R and R\" are curnyl group. In the initiation steps, cumene may go through several different proc- esses to become cumyi radical ( Eq. ( ) ). Firstly, cumene may dissociate its C-H bond photochem- ically or thermally for molecules with sufficient high thermal energy. Secondly, impurities with available low energy pathway may dissociate into radicals which then react with cumene to form curnyl radicals. Thirdly, the catalyst containing transition metal ion may catalyze the reaction of cumene with oxygen to form cumyi radical and hydrogen peroxide. [16] IfCHP is present, it can dissociate into free radicals (Eq. (2)) which in turn react with cumene to form cumyi radicals. In the propagation steps, the cumyi radical reacts with oxygen to form the peroxy radical that abstracts a hydrogen from cumene to regenerate the curnyl radical. In the termination steps, the free radicals in solution combine to form diamag- netic, inactive compounds. Because of the high reactivity of cumyi radical, Eq. (6) and (7) are insignificant in the presence ofdioxygen above 13 kPa. [171 In the branching reaction in Eq. (8) [ 15 ], the cumyradical abstracts a hydroxyl group from CHP to form PP. The RO radical can further react with cumene or cumene hydroperoxide to form the radicals involved in the propagation steps. In the steady propagation stage of cumene oxi- dation, the rates of oxygen consumption are con- stant over a wide range of oxygen pressure P( Oz ) until P(O-i) is less than a threshold pressure Pg that increases with the degree of conversion of cumene as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3. This inde- pendence of the rate of oxygen consumption, or equivalently the rate of cumene autooxidation, on P(0^ is easily explained according to the mech- anism in Eqs. ( 1 )-( 8). The concentration of rad- icals involved in the propagation steps must be constant because the rapid reactions of radical ter- mination scavenge any excess radicals. The inde- pendence on P(O^) then indicates clearly that hydrogen abstraction in Eq. (4) is the rate deter- mining step in propagation. The increase ofPg o\" increased cumene conversion is explained by the existence of the branching reaction in Eq. (8). When CHP increases with cumene conversion, the rates of branching reactions also increase. This competing branching reaction leads to an increased Pg with cumene conversion. Since branching reaction leads to formation of PP, one then expects that selectivity to CHP decreases with cumene conversion as observed experimen- tally. To achieve a high selectivity toward CHP, P(O^) must always be greater thar- P at the desired cumene conversion. From the curves in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, at 20% cumene conversion, the PS values are 59 and 47 kPa for CHP initiated and Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 ( 0.2 g catalyst per 10 ml cumene ) catalyzed cumene autooxidation, respectively. In the autooxidation of cumene initiated by CHP, the concentration of ROO' must be the max- imum allowable concentration in the bulk cumene solution in the steady propagation stage. The con- centration ofR' must be small in this propagation stage. Therefore, the increased rate of cumene oxi- dation in the presence of Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 catalyst (0.2 g/10 ml cumene) cannot be due to the increased concentration of ROO' in the bulk solution. However, it is possible that the concen- tration of ROO' in the vicinity of catalyst exceeds that in the bulk and hence the rate of oxygen con- sumption is greater. In this case, one would expect that greater amount of catalyst would give greater rate of oxygen consumption. On the contrary, we found that there is an optimal amount of catalyst. Therefore, the concentration of ROO' radical can- not be large near the Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 cata- lyst. The existence of this optimal amount of Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 catalyst is a clear indication that in the catalyzed cumene autooxidation, there are opposing trends; one favors whereas the other disfavors a large rate of oxygen consumption. As 144 Y.F. Hsit et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 105 (1996) 137-144 an increased concentration of ROO' is inconsis- tent with a large rate, it is therefore concluded that the function of Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 is to speed up the rate-determining step in Eq. (4) by increas- ing the rate constant. The opposing trend is then attributed to a low concentration of ROO' in the bulk cause by the presence of the catalyst, Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6. When the amount of Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 increases, the concentration of ROO' decreases but the rate constants of Eq. (4) increases. The compromise of these two trend leads to an optimal dosage of catalyst. This pro- posed mechanism also finds support in the behav- iors of catalysts and support in the initiation period. The retarding effect of Chelex support is explained by its ability to decrease the concentra- tion of ROO'. The existence of an optimal amount of Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 in initiating cumene autooxidation can also be perfectly explained according to this mechanism. Cu(II) ion in Cu(RCOO)2 may have a coor- dination environment similar to that in (RCOO~ = strate) [181 as a homogeneous cat- alyst in cumene autooxidation decreases the selec- tivity to CHP. Therefore, the coordination environment in Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 must differ from that of Cu(RCOO)2 in a homogeneous system. 4. Conclusion We demonstrated that Chelex is a better support than PVP or Si02 for Cu(OAc)2 as a catalyst in cumene autooxidation to CHP. At 353 K, the autooxidation of cumene catalyzed by Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 used in an amount of 0.2 g for 10 ml cumene has the characteristics of a decreased induction period, a selectivity to CHP better than that initiated with CHP, a rate of cumene autooxidation 63% greater than that ini- tiated by CHP in the steady propagation stage, and a long life time of the Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 cata- lyst; no deactivation was observed in our experi- ment. This polymer-supported catalyst is therefore a potentially commercially important catalyst in cumene autooxidation or similar autooxidation processes of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene and isobutane.

The autooxidation of cumene to cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) in the presence of a supported catalyst was investigated. When Cu(OAc)2 was supported on Chelex, polyvinylpyridine or SiO2, it was demonstrated that polyvinylpyridine and SiO2 are poor supports for a catalyst in cumene autooxidation. Several metal ions supported on Chelex were tested for their effectiveness in initiating cumene autooxidation at 353 K. The rate of autooxidation follows the order Mn(II) > Cu(II) > Co(II) > Ni(II) > Fe(II). However, Mn(II) gives a poor selectivity to CHP as it can also catalyze the conversion of CHP to 2-phenyl-2-propanol. The most suitable catalyst in the steady propagation of cumene autooxidation has the composition of Cu(OAc)2 (0.6 mmol) on dried Chelex (1.0 g), denoted Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6. There is an optimal ratio of Cu(OAc)2-CHX-0.6 to substrate (0.2 g per 10 ml cumene) to achieve an autooxidation rate that is 63% greater than that initiated with CHP at 353 K. The selectivity to CHP is also greater. This ratio is also the best for the rate of initiation in cumene autooxidation to CHP. The lifetime of this catalyst is long; no sign of deactivation was observed in our experiments.
