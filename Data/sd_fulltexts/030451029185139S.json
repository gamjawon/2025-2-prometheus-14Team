Ford* Department of Chemistry, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK 74078 (U.S.A.) (Received June 12, 1990; revised October 6, 1990) Abstract The Wacker oxidation of 1-decene to 2-decanone by dioxygen catalyzed by Pd(OAc)a, hydroquinone and iron(II) phthalocyanine (FePc) in acidic aqueous dimethylformamide gives high yield in 40 min at room temperature. The major factors controlling the activity of the multi-component catalyst are the structure and morphology of the FePc, which were analyzed by IR spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and BET surface area measurement. The dimeric /i-oxo(l) form of FePc is highly active, has higher surface area, and is less crystalline than the inactive monomeric /3-FePc. The rate of oxidation using the most active catalyst is limited by the solubility of 1-decene in aqueous DMF. Introduction The oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde by molecular oxygen in the presence of aqueous HC1 using PdClg and CuClg as catalysts, the Wacker process, is one of the most important industrial processes employing transition metal catalysts [1 4]. Wacker oxidation is the most efficient method for the one-step synthesis of methyl ketones from 1-alkenes (5 8]. Several other transition metal-catalyzed oxidations of l-alkenes to methyl ketones are known [9-12]. In the catalytic cycle shown in Scheme 1, the oxidation of the alkene by Pd(II) is followed by the oxidation of Pd(0) to Pd(II) by cupric ion, and the oxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) by dioxygen. The oxidations of higher l-alkenes are usually carried out m aqueous dimethylformamide (DMF). They are slower than the oxidation of ethylene, and are often accompanied RCH = CH, + H^O + PdClz RC(0)CH3 + Pd(0) + 2 HC1 Pd(0) + 2 CuCl; PdCl; + 2 CuCl 2 CuCl + 0.5 0, + 2 HC1 2 CuCl; + H^O RCH=CH2 + 0.50; RC(0)CH3 Scheme 1.

A stoichiometric amount of benzoquinone has been used in place of Cu(II) to reduce the chloride content of reaction mixtures. A multi-component catalytic system containing a palladium salt, hydro- quinone and iron(II) phthalocyanine (FePc) was developed by Backvall and Hopkins for the oxidation of 1-alkenes to methyl ketones under mild conditions in chloride free media (Scheme 2) [13]. This synthetically useful method uses benzoquinone to oxidize Pd(0) to Pd(II) and FePc to catalyze the autoxidation of hydroquinone to benzoquinone. Backvall and coworkers also have demonstrated the synthetic utility of a triple catalytic system consisting of cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin [Co(TPP)], hydroquinone, and Pd(II) for the 1,4 oxidation of 1,3-dienes [14]. FePc and Co(TPP) are examples of transition metal macrocycles that are of great current interest due to their electrocatalytic activity and their structural and catalytic relation to the cytochromes P-450. FePc FePc is highly active for electrocatalytic reduction of dioxygen. Iron is the most widespread transition metal in living systems, and its complexes par- ticipate in a variety of biological processes such as transport of oxygen and electron transfer reactions. Phthalocyanines are more stable than porphyrins. Metallophthalocyanines and their derivatives are well known as pigments, and due to their high thermal stability, insolubility in many solvents, fastness to light and good dyeing properties, they are widely used in the textile, n-CgHnCH =CH2 + H;0 + Pd\"2 - n-CgHpC^CH, + Pd(0) + 2 H* Pd(0) + CfiH^O; (benzoquinone) + 2 H* Pd\"2 + CgHgO; (hydroquinone) C(,H(,C 2 + 0.5 C>2 Fepc - C^O; + Hp n-CgHpCH^CH; + 0.5 0, n-CgHpC(0)CH3 Scheme 2. 293 printing, and paper industries [15]. Iron(II) phthalocyanine has a high catalase activity [16]. MetaUophthalocyanines have been used as catalysts for oxidations of alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, phenols, and aldehydes, and for hydrogenations, dehydrogenations, and polymerizations [17]. The key component of the Wacker oxidation system, FePc, can exist as crystalline /3-FePc, and as two different crystalline forms of dimeric ;u- oxo FePc species (FePc 0 FePc), called JLI-OXO(I) and Ju.-oxo(2) [18]. Differences between the three species are observed in IR spectra, X-ray powder spectra and magnetic susceptibility measurements. In this paper the oxidation of 1-decene is reported using iron(II) phthalocyanine obtained from different sources and having different catalytic activities, and the catalytic activity is related to the presence of /3-FePc, JH-OXO(I) and /i-oxo(2) species and to the morphology of the catalyst. Experimental 1-Decene (Fluka, 98%), 2-decanone (Aldrich, 98%), Pd(OAc)2 (Aldrich, 98%), HC104 (Baker, 60%), DMF (Fisher), hexadecane (Aldrich, 99%) and other chemicals were used as received unless otherwise mentioned. Hydro- quinone was recrystallized from acetone before use. Iron(II) phthalocyani- netetrasulfonate and cobalt(II) phthalocyaninetetrasulfonate were prepared by the procedure of Weber and Busch [26]. Water was purified by treatment with active carbon and a mixed bed ion-exchange resin and distillation in a glass apparatus. Its resistivity was > 1 ohm cm. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer model 681 spectrophotometer with KBr pellets containing 1 to 2 wt.% FePc. Visible spectra were recorded in cone. HgSO^ on a Varian DMS 200 spectrophotometer. NMR spectra were recorded with a Varian XL- 300 spectrometer at 300 MHz for ^ and 75.43 MHz for ^C. The samples for SEM (JEOL JSM-35) were coated with 200 A of a mixture of gold and palladium. BET surface area measurements were carried out at Phillips Petroleum Co. on a Quantachrome Autosorb-6 nitrogen pore size distribution instrument. The samples were outgassed for 4 to 5 h at 300 C and 5 JiimHg to remove traces of moisture and hydrocarbons. Sublimation of FePc (Eastman Kodak and American Tokyo Kasei) was carried out in a tube furnace at 450 C and 0.05 mmHg. X-ray powder diffraction experiments were carried out on a Siemens 501 powder diffractometer using CuK,, radiation. Oxidation of 1-decene Pd(OAc)2 (17.0 mg, 0.076 mmol), hydroquinone (25 mg, 0.23 mmol), FePc (43.0 mg, 0.076 mmol), DMF (1.0 ml), HgO (0.10 ml), 60% aqueous HC104 (8 jU,L, 0.074 mmol), and a magnetic stirring bar were placed in a 50-ml round-bottom flask with a stoppered side arm. The consumption of oxygen with time at constant pressure was followed with a gas buret which was connected to the flask through a condenser. The system was swept with dioxygen at 10-20 mmHg and then filled to 720 15 mmHg at 24 1 C. 294 1-Decene (1.60 mmol) was added by syringe with stirring. After 1 min the system was set to measure gas consumption and the oxygen uptake was followed for 40-100 min. GLC analyses were carried out using a Hewlett Packard model 5840A chromatograph with thermal conductivity detector, temperature programming, and a 6 ft X 1/8 inch (1.826 mx3.17 nun) o.d. Tenax column (Supeico Inc.). The amounts of 1-decene and 2-decanone were determined in mol% with respect to hexadecane and accounted for 85 to 100% of the starting 1-decene. In one experiment after 66% conversion of 1-decene based on Og uptake, 2-decanone was isolated as follows. The product mixture was extracted with 30 ml of petroleum ether. The organic extract was washed with 5 ml of saturated NaCI and with 5 ml of water, dried over anhydrous MgS04 and evaporated. The crude product was chromatographed over 60-200 mesh silica gel with 97/3 petroleum ether/diethyl ether, to yield 140 mg (56%) of 2-decanone as a colorless oil, which was identified by ^ and ^C NMR spectra and GC retention time identical with authentic material. The 'H NMR spectrum of the material with shorter retention time indicated isomers of 1-decene and < 1% of 1-decanal. Most experiments with the active FePc catalysts were analyzed by Og uptake and by GLC analysis, with agreement to within 10% of the amount of 1-decene consumed. Occasionally there were differences of > 10% between the conversion of 1-decene determined by GLC and the percent conversion measured by Og uptake. We attribute this to fluctuations in laboratory air temperature, since the gas buret was not thermostatted. Kinetic experiments were followed by gas buret only. Recycling experiments The reaction was conducted as usual for measurement of dioxygen consumption as a function of time. After consumption of the molar amount of dioxygen corresponding to complete conversion of 1-decene, a fresh sample of 1.60 mmol of 1-decene was added by syringe. Sometimes a second portion of another component of the reaction mixture, such as Pd(OAc)a, hydroquinone or FePc, was also added. The rates of the reactions were followed by the gas buret procedure. Results and discussion Activities of different FePc samples A typical reaction mixture consisting of Pd(OAc)a (4.7 mol% relative to 1-decene), hydroquinone (14 mol%), FePc (4.7 mol%), HgO (0.12 ml), DMF (1.0 ml) and 60% HC104 (4.6 mol%) was stirred at room temperature under 1 atm pressure of dioxygen (1 atm=760 mmHg= 1.013 X 105 N m~2). The reaction flask was connected to a gas buret. 1-Decene (1.60 mmol) was added all at once, and using an active form of FePc, 17.5 ml of Og (85% 295 of theoretical based on the stoichiometry of Scheme 2) was consumed in 36 min. No Og was consumed during the following 75 min. Five different commercial FePc samples from three different sources were tested (Table 1). The most active sample was a bluish-purple powder from Strem Chemical Co. A greenish black powder from Eastman Kodak Co. showed poor activity. Other transition metal macrocycle complexes, manganese(II) phthalocyanine, cobalt(II) phthalocyanine, copper(II) phthal- ocyanine, iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin /A-OXO dimer, iron(II) phthalocyani- netetra(sodium sulfonate) and cobalt(II) phthalocyaninetetra(sodium sulfo- nate), were less active than FePc. Cobalt(II) tetraphenylporphyrin and Co(II) bis(salicylidme)ethylenediamine were earlier reported to have poor catalytic activity [13]. The treatment of a suspension of inactive FePc in DMF with dioxygen, as well as the treatment of inactive FePc with cone. HgSt^ in air, followed by precipitation from water, increased its activity (Table 1). The active Strem FePc sample did not show any catalytic activity when the reaction was attempted in an aqueous solution of poly(JV-vinylpyrrolidone) or in aqueous acetonitrile instead of in DMF. Analyses of FePc samples The IR spectrum of the active FePc (Strem) showed distinct peaks at 822 and 849 cm~1, attributed to the ju,-oxo(l) dimer [18], that were weak or absent in the spectra of less active or inactive FePc samples.

FePc after treatment with DMF and Og showed peaks at 822 and 849 cm-1. Elemental analyses of the different FePc samples are reported in Table 2. The analyses were performed in duplicate with samples submitted at different times. There was no general correlation between the elemental analyses and catalytic activity. The experimental and calculated values deviated by as much as 5% even with the active FePc catalysts. X-ray powder diffraction spectra of the FePc samples revealed differences in the crystallinity of the samples. The spectra of the active FePc samples (Strem and American Tokyo) were identical and showed only a few broad unresolved peaks, indicating a low degree of crystallinity. The powder dif- fraction spectra of the inactive FePc (Kodak) and sublimed FePc showed several sharp peaks, different from those of the active samples, indicating a higher degree of crystallinity. The sublimed FePc (American Tokyo) had a powder spectrum that showed greater crystallinity than the original active sample. BET surface area measurements of various FePc samples are reported in Table 3. The catalytically active FePc samples had surface areas of about 30 m2 g~1 compared with about 3 m2 g~1 of the inactive FePc samples. Sublimation of the initially active FePc that had a high surface area gave FePc with low surface area. Powdering the initially active FePc in a Wig-L- Bug also reduced its surface area. Scanning electron micrographs of the FePc samples revealed marked differences. Active samples were amorphous clusters with poorly defined edges (Fig. la). The inactive samples had a well-defined crystalline morphology (Fig. Ib). After sublimation the initially inactive Kodak FePc crystals had TABLE 2 Elemental analyses of FePc FePc Source % C % H % N % Fe Calcd for CgaHieNgFe 67.62 2.84 19.71 9.82 Calcd for C64H32NieOFe2 66.68 2.80 19.44 9.69 Strem 1 64.41 2.85 19.54 9.93 Strem 1 63.86 2.78 18.40 9.18 Strem 2\" 64.29 2.69 18.55 10.38 American Tokyo 64.57 2.69 19.22 9.83 American Tokyo 64.44 2.75 18.48 9.29 Eastman Kodak I 62.84 2.86 18.58 9.03 Eastman Kodak I 61.25 3.05 17.66 8.27 Eastman Kodak 2 67.82 2.72 19.51 9.25 Eastman Kodak 2 67.42 2.81 19.72 9.15 Sublimed Kodak I 67.94 2.73 19.49 9.50 Sublimed Kodak I 67.06 2.75 19.58 9.30 The sample was subjected to BET surface analysis prior to elemental analysis. 297 TABLE 3 BET surface area measurements FePc source Condition Surface area (m2 g-') Strem (2) as received 30 American Tokyo as received 27 Eastman Kodak (1) as received 2.9 American Tokyo sublimed 2.9 American Tokyo powdered 1.2 rougher surfaces. Sublimation of the initially active FePc (American Tokyo) gave larger crystals (Fig. Ic). The crystal morphology of active FePc changed after powdering in a Wig-L-Bug and became less catalytically active (Fig. Id). The morphology of the active FePc sample recovered from a reaction mixture was changed (Fig. Ie). Treatments of the inactive FePc with cone. HgSC^/Oa and with DMF/air made it appear less crystalline (Figs. If and Ig). The catalytic activity of the active FePc (Strem 2) also decreased after the sample was subjected to BET surface area treatment, and the SEM showed regions of large crystals in addition to less crystalline regions (Fig. Ih). Visible spectra of the Strem 1, American Tokyo, and Kodak 1 FePc samples in 96% HgSC^ were identical. The absorbance at the 777 nm maximum of the solution (l.Ox 10~5 M) decreased on standing in air, and the purple color slowly faded [19]. Bubbling N3 through the HaS04 solution for 15 nun increased the absorbance, and bubbling Og for 60 min after the initial N3 bubbling decreased the absorbance. The absorbance increased when N3 was bubbled through the solution again. Structures of the JL(,-OXO(I) and Ju,-oxo(2) aimers have been proposed by Ercolani and coworkers [18-20]. Deformation electron density maps of the crystal structure of /3-FePc indicate that a ^EgA. state is the major contributor to the ground state [21]. Treatment of a DMF suspension of /3- FePc with dioxygen leads to absorption of 0.25 mol dioxygen per mol FePc and formation of the /y,-oxo(l) dimer. The dimer has a magnetic susceptibility of 2.10 JU.B per Fe (vs. 3.87 ;U,B for JS-FePc) and IR bands at 852 and 824 cm\"1 assigned to the asymmetric Fe O Fe stretching mode on the basis of isotopic shifts of the band when ^Og is used to prepare the dimer and a lack of changes of any other band in the spectrum of the labeled material. Treatment of /3-FePc with dioxygen in cone. sulfuric acid, or in a mixture of propylamine and 1-chloronaphthalene, forms a different dimer called /x.- oxo(2), which has still different IR bands in the 800-900 cm\"1 range and a magnetic susceptibility of 1.4 1.6 ^a per Fe. ESR and Mossbauer spectra indicate that both aimers contain high spin (S=5/2) antiferromagnetically coupled five-coordinate Fe(III) dimeric species [18, 20]. Although there have been no single crystal X-ray analyses of the FePc /i-oxo dimers, Ercolani speculates, by analogy to crystal structures and magnetic moments of several 299 other ^-oxo Fe dimers and of PyPcMn 0 MnPcPy (Py=pyridine), that the ^,-oxo(2) FePc has a nearly linear Fe O Fe arrangement and that the /A- oxo(l) structure has a smaller Fe O Fe bond angle. The differences in the catalytic activities of the various FePc's are attributed to their structures and morphologies. The active samples contain mainly ^i-oxo(l) aimers, and the inactive samples contain mainly /3-FePc according to the IR spectra. The highly active FePc samples are of low crystallinity according to the scanning electron micrographs and X-ray powder diffraction spectra, and their BET surface areas are ten times higher than those of the inactive FePc samples. SEM and X-ray powder diffraction of the inactive FePc (Kodak) reveal regions of high crystallinity. The SEM of the Kodak FePc (Fig. Ib) appears the same as a published SEM of crystals of /3-FePc [22]. Slight differences between the catalytic activities of Strem (1), Strem (2) and American Tokyo FePc's may be due to variations in crystallinity, although their micrographs look nearly the same. The differences in activities may be due simply to differences in surface area, with the fi.- oxo(l) dimer the active species, since /3-FePc is known to convert to the /A-OXO(I) dimer by treatment with dioxygen in DMF. The various treatments of commercial FePc samples change both the structure and the morphology. The present treatment of an inactive FePc sample with DMF/Og converted it at least partly to the /z-oxo(l) species. The activity of the Kodak FePc also increased after treatment with cone. HaS04/02 followed by precipitation from water (reported by Ercolani [18] to form the Ju,-oxo(2) dimer). The increased activity may be attributed to regions of low crystallinity in the sample as revealed by SEM (Fig. If). Sublimation of the active FePc gave a less active catalyst with a higher degree of crystallinity and a lower BET surface area. The electrocatalytic activities of FePc's also depend on structure. The electrocatalytic activities of a series of iron phthalocyanines were found to decrease in the order: dimer > polymer (prepared from 1,2,4,5-tetracyano- benzene) monomer [23, 24]. The electrocatalytic activities of /3-FePc and the /A-OXO species for reduction of Og on high surface area carbon by cyclic voltammetry and rotating disk polarization experiments indicated that the redox characteristics of all the forms of FePc are due to a single type of surface species [22]. Quantum mechanical calculations indicate that Fe(II)Pc should bind dioxygen more strongly than Fe(III)Pc [22, 25]. Dioxygen which penetrated the lattice appeared to form JU.-OXO compounds [22]. Kinetic studies Relative activities of various FePc samples were determined by measuring the rate of dioxygen uptake with a gas buret. No significant induction period was observed. Figure 2 illustrates the oxygen uptake profile of the most active FePc catalysts. The rate accelerated slightly during the first 10-15% conversion, followed approximately zero-order uptake of dioxygen from 15-~60% conversion, and decreased gradually after 60% conversion.

See Experimental for conditions. end of each experiment the molar amount of 2-decanone formed was analyzed by GLC to be twice the molar amount (+7%) of Og consumed. Zero-order rate constants from the middle range of dioxygen uptake were compared. Selected experiments done two or three times indicated random errors of +10% in the zero-order rate constants. The rate did not depend upon the initial amounts of 1-decene from 1.0 mmol to 2.4 mmol, or on amounts of hydroquinone in the range 14 24 mol%, but was slower by a factor of 2.5 when 9 mol% hydroquinone was used. The rate did not depend on the amount of Pd(II) in the range of 2.5-4.7 mol%, but was a factor of 2.0 slower with 1.4 mol% of Pd(II). The zero-order rate constant at a 1.0 molar ratio of HC1C>4 to Pd(II) was twice the rate found at 0.5 and at 2.0 molar ratios. This implies that 1.0 mol of HC104 converts one acetate of the original Pd(OAc)2 to HOAc to form the catalytically active species that contains one acetate ion per Pd*. Previously Backvall and Hopkins noted that more than one molar equivalent of HC104 had \"no major effect on the overall rate\" but led to alkene isomerization [13]. Amounts of active FePc in the range 0.62 4.7 mol% did not affect the rate significantly. The partial pressure of dioxygen over the reaction mixture was varied by use of oxy- gen-nitrogen mixtures at 1 atm total pressure. The rate of reaction up to at least 75% conversion was the same in 100% Og and 73.8% Og, but was a factor of 2.2 slower in air (21% Og). The Og consumption versus time plots indicate that under most conditions the rate of Wacker oxidation of 1-decene under standard conditions is zero- order in all components: Pd(OAc)2, HC104, hydroquinone, FePc, dioxygen and 1-decene. Initially it was suspected that oxygen mass transfer from the gas phase into the heterogeneous reaction mixture might be rate limiting with active FePc catalysts, since the reactions were fast and oxygen con- sumption ceased after 40 min. With the standard 1.4 ml of reaction mixture *We thank a reviewer for suggesting this experiment. 301 (Table 1) the rate of Og uptake was the same while mixing with a magnetic stirrer and with a table top shaker, but the rate was a factor of 16 slower when the mixture was sonicated. When a reaction mixture was purged continuously with dioxygen, and the conversion of 1-decene to 2-decanone was followed by GLC, the rate was unchanged from that determined by gas buret measurement. These results prove that oxygen mass transport is not rate limiting under the standard conditions of a stirred mixture under 1 atm of Da. However, it is still possible that oxygen mass transport limits the rates of the reactions carried out under air. Under the standard reaction conditions, the solubility of 1-decene in the DMF/water phase was measured to be only 1.5% of the amount initially charged. Thus the concentration of 1-decene in the DMF/water phase is effectively constant throughout the reaction, and the rate is limited by the solubility of the 1-decene. This accounts for the zero-order kinetics observed under most conditions. Catalyst recycling In order to test the recyclability of the catalyst system, a second 1.60 mmol portion of 1-decene was added to a product mixture, after oxidation of the first portion. The rate of the reaction decreased during the second cycle (Fig. 3). To determine which component of the reaction mixture limited the rate of oxidation, a second portion of one of the other components of the reaction mixture was added along with a second portion of 1-decene. In four separate experiments 0.076 mmol of Pd(II), 0.046 mmol of HC104, 0.23 mmol of hydroquinone in 0.05 ml of DMF, and 0.02 mmol of FePc did not restore the rate during the second cycle to the initial fast rate observed during the first cycle. Second cycle activities were only slightly less than first cycle activity during 30% to 50% conversion, but were markedly lower beyond 50% conversion. The decrease in the activity as the reaction 20 40 60 80 Time (min) Fig. 3. Oxidation of 1-decene (1.60 mmol) catalyzed by FePc (American Tokyo): (a) first cycle; (b) second cycle of 1-decene (1.60 mmol) and added second 0.076 mmol portion of Pd(OAc)a; (c) 0.046 mmol of HC104 was added after 64% conversion of 1-decene based on Oz uptake; (d) third cycle of 1.60 mmol of 1-decene. 302 proceeds may be attributed to a change in the morphology of FePc which retards the binding of dioxygen that is essential for catalysis. The change in morphology is illustrated by the scanning electron micrographs of Figs. la and Ie. Conclusions Monomeric, greenish black /3-FePc is catalytically inactive. FePc samples that have high catalytic activity are bluish purple and contain the /A-oxo(l) dimer. The active catalysts have high surface area and a low degree of crystallinity. The presence of the /z-oxo(l) species can be detected in the IR spectrum. The inactive ;3-FePc can be converted to an active catalyst by treatment with DMF and air. A rapid precipitation of a FePc solution in cone. HaS04 into water also gives a less crystalline, more catalytically active material. Although these conclusions are based only on the Wacker oxidation of 1-decene, they likely can be applied also to other reactions catalyzed by FePc.

Ford 1 Department of Chemistry, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK 74078 U.S.A. 1 Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. The Wacker oxidation of 1-decene to 2-decanone by dioxygen catalyzed by Pd(OAc)2, hydroquinone and iron(II) phthalocyanine (FePc) in acidic aqueous dimethylformamide gives high yield m 40 min at room temperature. The major factors controlling the activity of the multi-component catalyst are the structure and morphology of the FePc, which were analyzed by IR spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and BET surface area measurement. The dimeric μ-oxo(1) form of FePc is highly active, has higher surface area, and is less crystalline than the inactive monomeric β-FePc. The rate of oxidation using the most active catalyst is limited by the solubility of 1-decene in aqueous DMF. References 1 J. Smidt W. Hafner R. Jira R. Sieber J. Sedlmeier A. Sabel Int. Ed. Engl.
