BAR, YOEL SASSOV* Casali Institute of Applied Chemistry, The Hebrew Urciuersity, Jerusalem (Israel) and dOCHANADI BLUM Department of Organic Chemistry, The Hebrew Uniuersity, Jerusalem (Israel) (Received January 6, 1382) Snnsmary Palladium-tr-phenylphosphine-catalyzed transfer hydrogenolysis of aryl bromides by aqueous sodium formare in a two-liquid phasse system is described. Tetrahexylammonium hydrogen sulfate proved to be the best phase transfer catalyst in this system. Substitution of the H20 by D20 led to the selective transformation of the ar=yl bromides to monodeuterated products. Introduction Although phase transfer catalysis has already been applied to many organic syntheses [lj , only a small number of reducing agents proved suitable for this technique (e.g. [2, 31 ). In a previous communication [4) we reported the use of aqueous sodium formate in the ruthenium-catalyzed reduction of lY,P-unsaturated ketones in a biphasic system. We now extended our studies to include such hydrogen transfer from formate to aryl halides in the presence of a phosphinated palladium catalyst (eqn. (1)).

Reaotion conditions as in the Experimental. at an initial pressure of 3.3 MPa. After 6 h at 120 C the reaction vessel was refilled with CO to the same pressure and left at 120 'k- for 16 h. The reaction mixture of pH 7 eras cooled and the solvent removed in uacuo. The resulting solid proved to be analytically pure DCOONa (> 99% dl) having the same spectroscopic properties as authentic formate-d prepared from sodium cyanide [5] . 13C 20 1vIHz NMR, (D20) s 171.23 ppm (t,J= 29.6 Hz). General procedure of transfer hydragennlysis of aryl bromide In a typical example, a mixture of 10 ml of o-xylene, 7.0 mg (10-2 mmo1) of P(iC12(PPh3)2, 39.3 mg (0.15 mmol) of triphenylphosphine, 90.4 mg (0.2 mmol) of tetrahexylammonium hydrogen sulfate, 70 mg of 1-methylnaphthalene (internal standard, 207 mg of 2-bromonaphthalene and 8.7 ml of deionized water was placed under argon atmosphere in a round-bottomed flask, stirred magnetically and heated with the aid of an oil-bath thermostat to 100 t 1 C. When the system was thermally equilibrated, a solution of 0.67 g (10 mmol) of sodium formate in 0.67 ml of water was injected into the reaction flask. The progress of the process was monitored with a 3700 Varian gas chromatograph equipped with a FID detector, temperature programmer and a 50 cm long copper column packed with 5% OV-101 on Chromosorb G (100 - 120 mesh) operated between 130 and 280 C. Some reaction profiles of this process using different phase transfer catalysts are shown in Figure 1. 177 Results and discussion While aryl bromides a-Rd iodides underwent smooth hydrogenolysis under the conditions given in the Experimental, aryl chlorides proved to react either very slowly or not at ail. Comparison of the dehalogenation of bromobenzene by five well-known homogeneous catalysts (see Table I) revealed that PdC12(PPh3 )2 has the highest activity, and was therefore chosen for this study. The palladium. complex suffered, however, from the disadvantage of being easily reduced to metal by aqueous sodium formate. Addition of excess triphenylphosphine was necessary to avoid catalyst deterioration. Optimum results were obtained when the ratio PdC12 (PPh3 )2 : PPh3 was I : 15. Under these conditions the reacting catalyst can be assumed to exist mainly as chlorine-free palladium-triphenylphosphine complexes (chiefly as tetralds(triphenylphosphine)pailadienn) [6] .

The reduction of the PdCl,,(PPh3)2 (which occurred in the absence of free phosphine) was associated with a significant decrease in the rate of aryl bromide hydrogenolys'Ys. We have shown that metallic palladium (in the absence of a base) is not only an inefficient catalyst in reaction (1) (see also [8] ), but (in contrast to PdC12(PPh3)2/PPh3i promotes rapid decomposition of the formate reagent according to eqn. (3).

For example, the half-life time of reaction (3) using a mixture of 5 ml of 2 M aqueous sodium formate, 5 ml of 60 mM solution of tetra hexylammonium hydrogen sulfate in o-xylene and 548 mg of 10% Pd/C, and that of the same reaction in the absence of the ammonium salt were 30 and 5 min, respectively. In the attempt to eliminate completely the competitive formate decomposition reaction (3), we carried out experiments (with PdC12(PPh3)2jPPh3 as well as with Pd/C) in the presence of anhydrous sodium formate. We found, however, that in the absence of water neither reaction (3) nor reaction (1) proceeded at all. As similar observations have already been reported for some other cases [9] , it can be concluded that the catalytic hydrogenolysis of aryl bromides simply cannot take place in a solid-liquid phase system. The addition of one mol of water per mol of formate was enough to initiate the catalytic process. Various alkyl-, alkoxyl- and chloro-derivatives of bromobenzene and 2-bromonaphthalene were used as substrates in reaction (1). In all experiments (conditions as described above), the yields of the bromine-free products were > 95%. In the absence of the phase transfer catalyst, the reduction proceeded very slowly. Comparative experiments indicated that our biphasic system led to better results than those of Helquist [10] who applied sodium formate-DMF as hydrogen donor. Since the rate of hydrogenolysis depends on formate concentration in the organic solvent, the extracting ability of the phase transfer catalyst, is of primary importance (see Fig. 1). Typical half-life times for the reduction of 2-bromonaphthalene in the presence of tetrahexylammonium hydrogen sulfate, hexadecyltributylphosphonium bromide, tricaprylmethylammonium chloride (Aliquat-336), tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, tetrabutylphosphonium bromide and no onium salt at all, were found to be 95, 153, 180, 240, 3 7 5 and,630 min, respectively. The reaction rates proved O be dependent on the electronic nature of the substrate. Table 2 indicates that introduction of electron-donating groups enhances the process, while electron attracting substituents cause it to slow down. The catalysis is also sensitive to steric effects. For example, when 2-, and the more hindered 1-bromonaphthalene were reacted under the same conditions (in the presence of Aliquat-336, the respective conversions were 31 and 8% after 60 min. All these results are compatible with the mechanism of transfer hydrogenolysis suggested by Cortese and Heck [8]. Oxidative addition of the aryl bromide to the palladium complex (which is assumed to contribute to the rate-determining step by virtue of the above electronic effect), followed by 179 'ABLE 2 Transfer hydragenolysis of soave bromobenzene derivatives in ff biphasic system by HCOONa and PdCI2(PPh3)2/PPh3 Substrate Conversion after I h (%o) ire presence of in absence of phase Aliquat-336 transfer catalyst 4-BrCGH4C113 53 4 Cr,H5.:Br 29 < 1 4-BrC6H&CH0 22 5 4-BrCGH4C1 10 5 Reaction conditions: 2 0f PdC12(PPIh3)2, 30 raM PPb3, 40 mM Aliquat-336 and 200 mM of substrate is 5 ml mesitylene; 2 M sodium. formate in 5 ml water. Reaction temperature 100 C. displacement of the bromide on the metal by formate and extrusion of carbon dioxide, leads to the formation of an arylpalladium hydride.

We found, in fact, that it is unnecessary to employ expensive deuterated formate or formic acid-d2 (Cf., [8] ), as extensive H-D exchange proved to take place in situ. When, e.g., 2-bromonaphthalene was treated for 2 h with HCOONa in D20 instead of in 1120 under the conditions given in the Experimental section, mass spectral analysis indicated that the product consisted of 62% naphthalene-d,. and. 3890 naphthalene-do. When the aqueous phase of this experiment was recycled and heated with a new portion of 1-bromonaph- thalene, we obtained 2-deuterionaphthalene having > 95% isotopic purity. Best results were obtained when the bromo compound was added to HCOONa in D20 which was pretreated with PdC12(PPh,3)2/PPh,3 and tetrahexylammonium hydrogen sulfate in o-xylene at 1 0 C for 15 h. This procedure seems to be one of the simplest and most effective routes to selective introduction of one deuterium atom into an aromatic hydrocarbon. 180 Acknowledgements We are grateful to Professor 11fflton Orchin for his advice and to the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) for financial support of this study.
