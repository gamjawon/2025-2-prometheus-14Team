Graphical abstract In this paper, the potential of transition metal atom (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Pt, Ag and Au) embedded bismuthene as the single-atom catalyst for CO oxidation has been systematically studied using first-principles calculation. Owing to the relatively high stability and strong adsorption energy for CO and O2 molecules, Pt embedded bismuthene (Pt/bismuthene) is demonstrated as the most suitable catalyst among the above transition metal embedded bismuthene. By exploring three reaction mechanism for CO oxidation, it is found that the calculated reaction barrier via tri-molecular Eley–Rideal mechanism is as low as 0.37 eV, suggesting that Pt/bismuthene has high catalytic activity for CO oxidation. The electronic structure analysis along the rate-determining step shows that the high catalytic activity of Pt/bismuthene is ascribed to the hybridization between the CO and O2 2π* orbitals and the Pt 5d orbital. Overall, our studies propose that Pt/bismuthene appears to be an excellent candidate of single-atom catalyst for CO oxidation. Keywords First-principles calculation Single-atom catalyst CO oxidation Pt embedded bismuthene 1 Introduction For decades, the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) has been extensively studied because of its application in resolving the problem of environment pollution attributed to the emission from vehicles and industry [1] and probing the activity of heterogenous catalysis as a benchmark reaction [2]. Supported metal clusters, especially those consist of noble metals, have drawn widespread interest on account of their high catalytic activity for CO oxidation [3–5]. However, the catalyst performance of the supported metal clusters can be strongly affected by the size and shape of the supported nanoparticles and the atom utilization efficiency is low since only the surface atoms act as active sites [6,7]. Innovative researches reported by Qiao et al. discovered that downsizing the Pt particles size supported on FeO x to single atom is a good approach to enhance the catalytic activity and maximize the atom utilization [8]. After that, other single atoms supported by metal oxide and two dimensional (2D) materials substrates, for example, Al2O3 [9,10], CeO2 [11,12], TiO2 [13], graphene [14,15], C2N [16] and MoS2 [17] also present high catalytic activity, which suggests that the single-atom catalyst (SAC) is desirable in the field of CO oxidation catalysis. Recently, bismuthene, the heaviest group-V 2D material, has drawn immense attention owing to its tunable electronic property, large charge carrier mobilities, rich allotropic transformation and large spin-orbit coupling [18,19]. It has been also predicted as potential material in electronic, optoelectronic, thermoelectric and topological application [20–23]. Bismuthene has a buckled structure like silicene [24–26], germanene [27], and phosphorene [28,29] that arises mainly due to pseudo-Jahn-Teller effects. With the development of 2D materials fabrication technologies, bismuthene has been obtained through various methods, such as liquid exfoliation, hot-pressing and wet chemical methods [30]. Importantly, theoretical and experimental investigations have reported that bismuthene exhibits good stability even at high temperatures [31,32]. Moreover, Kadioglu et al. have investigated the electronic, magnetic and topological properties of the single atom adsorbing on bismuthene [33]. In addition, Qi et al. have revealed the modification of electronic features and magnetism of single metal atom doped bismuthene [34]. However, there is a lack of the exploration of the chemical activity of single atom decorated bismuthene. Thus, it is worth to observe the interaction behavior with gas molecules like CO, O2 and CO2 and the catalytic activity for CO oxidation of the single atom embedded bismuthene. In this work, the geometries and stabilities of single-metal atoms (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Pt, Ag and Au) decorated bismuthene are systematically studied by means of first principles calculation. Among them the single Pt atom doped bismuthene (Pt/bismuthene) configuration tends to exhibit higher stability and also show relatively strong interaction toward the adsorption gases (CO and O2). Therefore, the catalytic activity for CO oxidation on Pt/bismuthene is observed via three possible reaction mechanisms including Eley–Rideal (ER), Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) and tri-molecular Eley–Rideal (TER). It is found that both LH and TER are energetically and kinetically possible for CO oxidation, whereas the energy barrier for the rate-determining step of the TER mechanism (0.37 eV) is smaller than that of LH mechanism (0.44 eV), indicating the catalytic processes through the TER reaction are most favorable. It is concluded that Pt/bismuthene can be an efficient catalyst to CO oxidation. 2 Computational methods The first-principles calculations were performed using projected augmented wave (PAW) method as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [35–37]. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method in the form of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) was chosen for exchange correlation potential [38]. The k-point meshes of 5 × 5 ×1 were employed for Brillouin zone sampling. The energy cut-off of 500 eV was chosen for the planewave basis. An empty space of 15 Å was adopted to avert the interaction of adjacent layers and the DFT-D2 method of Grimme was considered for the van der Waals interaction [39]. The structures were fully optimized until the tolerance in total energy was smaller than 10−5 eV and the maximum forces on each atom were below 0.02 eV/Å in all the calculations. The bismuthene was simulated using a 4 × 4 ×1 supercell containing 32 bismuth atoms. The calculated lattice parameter of bismuthene was 4.34 Å, which corresponds with the previous values [22,34]. The climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method was applied to search for the minimum energy paths of CO oxidation. Bader analysis was adopted to obtain the amount of charge transfer in the system. The stability of the bismuthene was evaluated by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with the NVT ensemble and the Nosé–Hoover thermostat [40]. During the AIMD simulations, the time step was set to 2 fs, and the total time scale was 12 ps. The binding energy (E b ) and the adsorption energy (E a ) of atoms or molecules were calculated as: (1) E b / E a = E AB − E A − E B , where E AB , E A , and E B stand for the total energies of the substrate with atoms/molecules, clean substrate and free atoms/molecules, respectively. The cohesive energy E coh of the bulk metal was defined as follows: (2) E coh = ( E bulk − nE M ) / n , where n, E bulk , and E M represent the number of atoms in the bulk metal, the energies of the bulk metal and an isolated metal atom, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Screening of desirable single metal atom The fabrication of stable SAC requires the single metal atoms to interact with substrate intensively to prevent the aggregation of metal atoms into clusters, which means the metal atoms have a stronger binding or adsorption energy with the substrate than the cohesive energy in bulk [41]. In order to evaluate the possibility of using metal atoms (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Pt, Ag and Au) decorated bismuthene as SAC, it is necessary to first perform a fast screening of the most desirable metal atom. For this purpose, we calculated the binding energies of metal atoms embedded in the Bi vacancy site of bismuthene, which are shown in Table 2. We find that the Pt, Ag, and Au atoms would be stable at Bi vacancy with a larger absolute value of binding energies than their corresponding cohesive energies, while the absolute value of binding energies for Fe, Co, Ni, and Mn at Bi vacancy are smaller or almost identical to the cohesive energies, indicating that they tend to form clusters and are not suitable for SAC. In addition, the adsorption energies of these atoms in the most stable adsorption site of pristine bismuthene are also discussed. The adsorption energies of Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Pt, Ag, and Au atom are −3.37, −3.97, −3.56, −1.48, −4.75, −1.49, and −2.33 eV, respectively, which are weak compared with their corresponding cohesive energies showing that they have a clustering tendency. The adsorption strength of CO, O2, and CO2 is crucial to the performance of SAC on CO oxidation. Based on the above calculations, the adsorption energies of the most energetically favorable structures for O2, CO, and CO2 adsorbed on Pt, Ag, and Au atoms doped bismuthene are explored and are also given in Table 1 . For CO and O2 adsorption, we find that Pt doped bismuthene has the highest E a for CO (−1.52 eV) and O2 (−0.76 eV), while the E a of CO and O2 on Ag and Au doped system are relatively low indicating a weak interaction of CO and O2 on Ag and Au doped bismuthene. For CO2 adsorption, E a on Pt, Ag, and Au atom doped system are around −0.3 eV, reflecting the physisorption of CO2. The high E a for CO and O2 and low E a for CO2 of Pt doped bismuthene can prevent CO and O2 from diffusing away before reaction and guarantee the desorption of the generated CO2, respectively, which manifests that Pt/bismuthene is more favorable than Ag and Au atoms doped bismuthene as SAC for CO oxidation. Subsequently, the catalytic activity of Pt/bismuthene toward CO oxidation is systematically explored in an upcoming sections. 3.2 Geometry and electronic structure of Pt/bismuthene The geometry and electronic structure of Pt/bismuthene are investigated at first, and the results are depicted in Fig. 1 . Pt atom is embedded in Bi vacancy forming three bonds with the nearby Bi atoms and the bond lengths are about 2.68 Å. Bader charge result indicates Pt atom gains electrons (0.65 e) from substrate, which are mainly transferred from the neighboring Bi atoms. The electrons depletion of the neighboring Bi atoms is confirmed through charge density difference (CDD) depicted in Fig. 1b. The CDD also shows that the accumulation of electrons occurs mainly at the Pt–Bi bond, suggesting that strong chemical bonds are formed corresponding to the high binding energy of Pt/bismuthene. To further reveal the high binding energy of Pt/bismuthene, the projected density of states (PDOS) is calculated and it is plotted in Fig. 1c. We can observe that the Pt 5d orbitals overlap with those of Bi 6p, showing significant orbital hybridization among these states. In addition, the appearance of Bi 6p and Pt 5d orbitals near the Fermi level indicates a high chemical activity of Pt/bismuthene. Moreover, to confirm the stability of Pt/bismuthene, AIMD simulations were performed at various temperatures (300, 500, and 700 K) for 12 ps and shown in Fig. S1. The results of simulations show that the geometry structures are well maintained and the total energy shows slight oscillations at 300 K. Though distortions can be more obvious with higher temperature, the stable structure can still be kept at 500 K, indicating Pt/bismuthene is quite stable at least up to 500 K. The stability of the pristine bismuthene is also evaluated by AIMD simulations shown in Fig. S2. We can see that the structure of pristine bismuthene is also stable without any significant deformation at 500 K, which is in good agreement with the previous reports [31]. 3.3 Adsorption of molecules on Pt/bismuthene Before further exploring the CO oxidation process on Pt/bismuthene, the interaction of Pt/bismuthene with CO, O2, CO + O2, and CO + CO is studied. The most stable adsorption configuration of CO upon Pt/bismuthene is shown in Fig. 2 a, where CO takes a C-end configuration above the Pt atom and forms a Pt–C bond. The adsorption energy is −1.52 eV that is higher than CO on the Pt(111) surface (−1.34 eV) [42]. Bader charge analysis shows that CO atom gains 0.17 e from the Pt/bismuthene leading to an elongation of CO bond length from 1.14 Å to 1.17 Å. From the PDOS shown in Fig. 2a, the 2π* orbital of CO molecule splits into two parts and downshifts from the empty states to the partially occupied states. In addition, the Pt 5d state is depressed in the range of −4 to −1 eV after CO adsorption and overlaps strongly with the CO 2π* orbital, which indicates the electrons donation from Pt 5d state into the empty CO 2π* orbital. For O2 molecule adsorption, the most favorable configuration is the O2 molecule paralleling to the Pt/bismuthene surface displayed in Fig. 2b. The two O atoms are bonded to the Pt atom and the length of Pt–O bond is 2.22 Å. There is 0.59 e charge transferred from Pt/bismuthene to O2 molecule leading the O–O bond length elongated to 1.35 Å. The charge transfer can also be confirmed by the PDOS, where the spin down O2 2π* orbital downshifts from empty state to partially occupied state. The adsorption energy of O2 molecule is −0.76 eV, which is lower than that of CO molecule indicating the CO molecule is adsorbed in preference to the O2 for Pt/bismuthene. Considering that the working environment of CO oxidation normally occurs in O2 rich or in the presence of large amounts of H2, the CO oxidation will happen even though Pt/bismuthene has higher affinity to CO [43,44]. Since the CO molecule is preferred to be adsorbed on Pt/bismuthene when CO and O2 are injected simultaneously, we further considered the co-adsorption of two CO molecules. It is found that the forthcoming CO molecule can be co-adsorbed on the Pt atom with the pre-adsorbed CO molecule and this process releases a heat of 0.92 eV without any energy barrier. What's more, the possibility of CO and O2 co-adsorption is investigated. For the pre-adsorbed CO, we find that the forthcoming free O2 molecule will be automatically adsorbed on the Pt atom after geometry optimization in the software, forming a CO and O2 molecules co-adsorption structure. A co-adsorption structure will also be formed in the system including a free CO and a pre-adsorbed O2 molecule after optimization. Therefore, the co-adsorption of CO and O2 molecules is possible, although the adsorption energy for CO is higher than that for O2. Thus, the co-adsorption behavior for CO + O2 and CO + CO are investigated in this work. As shown in Fig. 3a, the CO and O 2 all adopt the end-on configurations upon the Pt atom and tend to repulse each other. Bader charge result shows that the CO obtains 0.11 e and O2 obtains 0.53 e leading that the C–O and O–O bonds are elongated to 1.16 and 1.31 Å, respectively. From the PDOS plotted in Fig. 3a, we can see that the Pt 5d orbital hybridizes with the 2π* orbital of CO and O2 molecules, confirming the strong interaction of CO and O2 molecules with Pt/bsimuthene. As for two CO molecules co-adsorption configuration shown in Fig. 3b, we find that the two CO molecules take the identical adsorption configuration and gain 0.16 e for each CO molecule with the C–O bond elongated to 1.17 Å. Also, the hybridization between Pt 5d orbital and CO orbitals is stronger than that in the single CO situation. Adsorption energies for CO + O2 and CO + CO are −1.98 and −2.64 eV, respectively, which are higher than that of the single CO and O2 molecules. Hence, the configurations of CO + CO and CO + O2 as the initial step for CO oxidation are considered in the following exploration. 3.4 CO oxidation on Pt/bismuthene Generally, CO oxidation may proceed through three possible reaction mechanisms, namely ER, TER and LH mechanism. In the ER mechanism, the free-standing CO molecule directly interacts with the already activated O2 molecule generating a carbonate-like intermediate state (CO3) to produce CO2. The LH mechanism starts with the co-adsorbed CO and O2 molecules and forms a peroxo-type OOCO intermediate state, then converts to CO2. In the TER mechanism, the physisorbed O2 approaches the pre-adsorbed two CO molecules forming an OCOOCO intermediate complex to generate two CO2. In our work, three mechanisms are studied to obtain a most energetically preferable mechanism. The adsorption configurations of each states (IS, TS, MS and FS) via ER mechanism are displayed in Fig. 4 . In ER-IS, the physisorbed CO suspends above the pre-adsorbed O2 with a minimum distance of 3.06 Å between the CO and O2. Then the CO molecule moves towards the O2 molecule leading the stretching of O–O bond. After going through a slight reaction barrier of 0.01 eV, the CO molecule inserts into the O–O bond and forms a carbonate-like intermediate state CO3 (ER-MS). This process is exothermic with an energy release of 4.47 eV. Subsequently, the CO3 overcomes an energy barrier of 1.20 eV dissociating into a CO2 molecule and leaving an activated O atom above the Pt atom with a large endothermic energy of 1.18 eV. The high energy barrier together with the endothermic reaction suggests that the ER mechanism is kinetically and thermodynamically impossible. This phenomenon was also found in the case of CO oxidation on Pt/penta-graphene [45] and Cu/h-BN [46]. The optimized configurations of various states via the LH mechanism for CO oxidation are shown in Fig. 5 . In the LH-IS1, the CO and O2 molecules are co-adsorbed on the Pt atom and the distance between the CO and O2 molecules is about 3.1 Å. Then the O2 molecule moves toward the CO molecule and the interactions between CO and O2 become stronger. Passing over the transition state (LH-TS1), one of the O atom of O2 is connected to the C atom forming a peroxide-like intermediate OOCO (LH-MS1). In the LH-MS1, the newly formed C-O bond is 1.36 Å and the O–O and C–O bond lengths are stretched to 1.51 and 1.22 Å, respectively. The formation of LH-MS1 is exothermic with energy release of 0.46 eV and the energy barrier of this process is 0.44 eV. The reaction continues to proceed by decomposing the LH-MS1 into a physisorbed CO2 molecule and an atomic O, which is estimated to be exothermic and has no reaction barrier. This is quite similar to the OOCO decomposition in Pt/MoS2 [43] and Pt-3N-graphene [47]. The CO2 molecule in the LH-MS2 can easily desorb owing to its small adsorption energy of −0.30 eV. After the desorption of CO2 molecule from the substrate, the subsequent process is the interation between the forthcoming CO molecule and the isolated O atom left upon the Pt atom. As Fig. 6 depicted, the configuration of CO suspending upon the pre-adsorbed O atom is set as LH-IS2 and the structure of a physisorbed CO2 above Pt/bismuthene is considered as LH-FS. In the reaction process, the CO molecule approaches the O atom, passes over LH-TS2, makes a bond with the O atom and then forms a CO2 molecule. The process almost has no energy barrier and releases energy of −2.81 eV. Thus, the rate-determining step of the LH mechanism is the formation of OOCO intermediate, which has a small reaction barrier of 0.44 eV. This indicates that the LH mechanism is thermodynamically and kinetically favorable. To further reveal the origin of the catalytic activity, the electronic structures of the absorbed CO and O2 molecules as well as the Pt 5d orbital in the rate-determining step via LH mechanism are studied. Corresponding results are shown in Fig. 7 . In the LH-IS1, the Pt-5d orbital strongly hybridizes with O2 and CO orbitals and leads to a charge transfer of 0.53 and 0.11 e to the O2 and CO molecule, respectively. While the hybridization of CO and O2 orbitals is small, suggesting a relatively weak interaction between CO and O2 molecules. From LH-IS1 to LH-TS1, the O2 2π* orbital downshifts toward the Fermi level by around 0.8 eV, which activates the O–O bond and the O–O distance increases to 1.36 Å. Meanwhile, the 1π and 5σ orbitals of CO molecule are broadened and hybridize with the 1π and 5σ orbitals of O2 molecule, indicating that the interaction between CO and O2 is strengthened. As the reaction proceeds to the LH-MS1, the CO orbital overlaps with the O2 orbital in the whole energy region, suggesting formation of the new C–O bond in the peroxide-like intermediate OOCO. In addition, the Pt 5d orbital hybridizes with the CO and O2 orbitals in the whole process, leading to the charge transfer and playing a critical part in the catalytic activity. The CO oxidation reaction profile through TER mechanism is shown in Fig. 8 . In initial state, the physisorbed O2 molecule is about 3.1 Å away from the two pre-adsorbed CO molecules. Then the O2 molecule approaches the CO molecules. After overcoming an energy barrier of 0.37 eV and releasing a heat of 1.42 eV, an OCOOCO intermediate is formed. In the TER-MS, the O2 inserts into the CO molecules and forms two new C–O bonds. The O–O bond of the O2 molecule and the C-O of the CO molecules are elongated to 1.5 and 1.23 Å, respectively. In the final step, the OCOOCO intermediate dissociates into two physisorbed CO2 with a slight reaction barrier of 0.03 eV and an energy release of 3.23 eV. Thus, the reaction barrier of the rate-determining step through TER mechanism is 0.37 eV, which is smaller than that via LH mechanism, showing the TER is the most favored mechanism on Pt/bismuthene for CO oxidation. To further estimate the catalytic activity of Pt/bismuthene, a comparison of reaction barriers with several other single atom catalysts is summarized in Table 2 . It is found that the reaction barrier of Pt/bismuthene via the TER mechanism is lower than that of most catalysts, for example, Pt/graphene (0.59 eV) [48], Fe/graphene (0.58 eV) [50], Pt/BN (0.38 eV) [52], Co/BN (0.41 eV) [53], Pt/MoS2 (0.40 eV) [43], Co/MoS2 (0.57 eV) [56], Fe/BC3 (0.38 eV) [55], Pd/Mo2CO2 (0.49 eV) [57] and is comparable to that of Al/graphene (0.32 eV) [49], Ag/BN (0.33 eV) [54], Au/silicene (0.34 eV) [58], indicating that Pt/bismuthene exhibits a high catalytic activity for CO oxidation. The electronic structures of the rate-determining step are investigated to go deep into the outstanding catalytic performance of Pt/bismuthene for CO oxidation through the TER mechanism (see Fig. 9 ). In the TER-IS, the CO 2π* orbitals hybridize with Pt 5d orbitals around the Fermi level and the CO molecules are negatively charged by 0.14 e per molecule. The O2 2π* orbitals are partially occupied near the Fermi level and the O2 molecule gains 0.19 e, suggesting that the O2 molecule is already activated to some extent by the two pre-adsorbed CO molecules. As O2 molecule approaches the CO molecule, the hybridization between the O2 and CO 2π* orbitals and Pt 5d orbital near the Fermi level becomes stronger. Finally, in the TER-MS, the CO and the O2 orbitals are overlapped with each other and hybridized with the Pt 5d orbital in the entire energy region. Moreover, the orbital overlapping leads to an electron transfer of about 0.49 e from the CO molecule to the O2 molecule, which accelerates the breaking of the O–O bond. Hence, the high catalytic activity through the TER mechanism can be attributed to the hybridization between the CO and O2 2π* orbitals and the Pt 5d orbital. 4 Conclusion Based on the first-principles calculation, the stability and adsorption energy for CO and O2 molecules on the Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Pt, Ag and Au doped the bismuthene are systematically studied. From the calculations, the Pt embedded bismuthene is considered to be a most appropriate catalyst towards CO oxidation owing to its relatively high stability and strong adsorption energy for CO and O2 molecules. The catalytic oxidation of CO upon Pt/bismuthene through ER, LH and TER mechanism are investigated. We find that the LH and TER mechanism are thermodynamically and kinetically favorable, while the TER mechanism has the lowest rate limiting energy barrier of 0.37 eV, suggesting that TER mechanism is the most efficient oxidation process. From the electronic analysis, we find that the hybridization between the CO and O2 2π* orbitals and the Pt 5d orbital plays a critical part in the high catalytic activity of Pt/bismuthene. The high stability together with the small reaction barrier promises that Pt/bismuthene may serve as an efficient SAC for CO oxidation.

        "dc:description": "In this paper, the potential of transition metal atom (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Pt, Ag and Au) embedded bismuthene as the single-atom catalyst for CO oxidation has been systematically studied using first-principles calculation. Owing to the relatively high stability and strong adsorption energy for CO and O2 molecules, Pt embedded bismuthene (Pt/bismuthene) is demonstrated as the most suitable catalyst among the above transition metal embedded bismuthene. By exploring three reaction mechanism for CO oxidation, it is found that the calculated reaction barrier via tri-molecular Eley–Rideal mechanism is as low as 0.37 eV, suggesting that Pt/bismuthene has high catalytic activity for CO oxidation. The electronic structure analysis along the rate-determining step shows that the high catalytic activity of Pt/bismuthene is ascribed to the hybridization between the CO and O2 2π* orbitals and the Pt 5d orbital. Overall, our studies propose that Pt/bismuthene appears to be an excellent candidate of single-atom catalyst for CO oxidation.",
