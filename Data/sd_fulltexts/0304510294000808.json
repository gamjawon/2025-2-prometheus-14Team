Relative reactivities of the cycloalkenes decreased in sequence C8 > CS > C7 > C6 > C ,o. These rates were not strongly affected by the catalysts indicating that the reactivities of cycloalkenes are mainly controlled by I-strain in the cycloalkene molecule. Transannular addition was observed in the reactions of cis-cyclooctene and cis-cyclodecene. The ratio of transannular to vicinal addition was significantly lowered by [RuC12(PPh3)3] and [CuCI(NHEt2)z], in comparison with dibenzoyl peroxide. A strong catalyst effect on the stereoselectivity of the addition reaction of cyclohexene was also recorded. The trans:cis isomer ratio of the adduct was significantly affected by ruthenium catalysts and, to lesser extent, by copper, molybdenum, cobalt and iron catalysts. The catalyst effect on regioselectivity and stereoselectivity strongly support a non-chain mechanism involving coordination of reactants and product formation at the metal centre in contrast to the classical initiation of chain reactions by organic peroxides.

Introduction We have previously been concerned with the addition of halocarbons to alkenes promoted by a range of transition metal complexes [ 1-7 ] . These studies have been principally involved with establishing the mechanism of such reactions. Cycloalkenes may be considered as convenient model compounds for such mechanistic *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDI0304-5102(94)00080-F 270 R. Davis et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 269-276 studies from the point of view of stereoselectivity or regioselectivity. Recently we have reported that there are no significant differences in stereoselectivity of the additional reaction between cyclohexene and tetrachloromethane when promoted by some metal catalysts or a classical initiator [ 7 ] . Such a reaction catalysed by a cobalt(II) amine complex gave the 1:1 adduct as an isomeric mixture with a trans:cis ratio of 59:41, very close to that obtained with dibenzoyl peroxide ( 53:47 ) . A similar isomer ratio of 55:45 was obtained in the same reaction in the presence of [ReC13(PPh3)Z(MeCN) ] [8], while in the presence of [RuC12(PPh3)3] a high stereoselectivity was previously reported leading to a 96:4 trans:cis isomeric ratio [9] thus indicating differences in the reaction mechanism. We were also intrigued by the report that the reaction between cyclohexene and tetrachloromethane in the presence of [Co2(CO)g] produced 7,7-dichloronorcarane [10], the formation of which suggests the intermediacy of dichlorocarbene. Surprisingly, this paper did not mention addition of CC14 to the cycloalkene in the presence of this catalyst. In the light of these findings, we wished to examine the behaviour of some catalysts which had previously been of interest to us. 2. Experimental All reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. All reagents and solvents were purified by standard methods immediately prior to use. GC analysis was performed on a HP 5890 A instrument with an HP Ultra-1 capillary column ( 25 m X 0.32 mm). 'H and '3C NMR spectra of the products were measured on a Varian XL 200 spectrometer with CDC13 as solvent. 2.1. Competitive kinetic runs Tetrachloromethane, cyclohexene, Cn cycloalkene and catalyst in the molar ratio of 10:1:1:0.01 were weighed into a glass ampoule with an internal standard. The reaction mixture was then magnetically stirred at room temperature (22 C) or heated to 80 C in an oil bath. Samples of the reaction mixture were taken through a septum at regular intervals and analysed by GC. The relative rates were followed by the formation of the 1:1 adducts and determined by calibration with authentic samples. 2.2. Reaction of cyclohexene with tetrachloromethane Mixtures of tetrachloromethane, cyclohexene and catalyst in the molar ratio of 3:1:0.001-0.01 were heated to 80 C for 6 h. The product mixtures were analysed by GC with respect to the trans:cis isomer ratio of 1-chloro-2-trichloromethylcyclohexane. 3-trichloromethylcyclohexene and trichloromethylcyclohexane were R. Davis et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 269-276 271 found as by-products in the reaction mixture amounting 0.0 to 2.6% and 0.0 to 1.9% respectively with amounts depending on the catalyst used. 2.3. Reaction of cis-cyclooctene and cis-cyclodecene with tetrachloromethane Mixtures of tetrachloromethane, cis-cyclooctene or cis-cyclodecene and catalyst in the molar ratio of 3:1:0.01 were stirred at room temperature (22 C) for 20 h or heated to 80 C for 6 h. The product mixtures were analysed by GC with respect to the ratio of isomers 1-chloro-2-trichloromethylcyclooctane to 1-chloro-4-trichloromethylcyclooctane or 1-chloro-2-trichloromethylcyclodecane to 1-chloro-6trichloromethylcyclodecane. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Reactivity of cycloalkenes The effect of ring size on the reactivity of CS-Cto cis-cycloalkenes in addition reactions with tetrachloromethane were investigated in detail. Relative reactivities expressed in terms of relative rate constants (krel=k lko) were determined by an established method [4]. Reactivities of CS-CIO cis-cycloalkenes were studied in the presence of [ CuCI ( NHEt2 ) 2 ] and [ RuC12 ( PPh3 ) 3 ] as catalysts or benzoyl peroxide as an initiator. The results are summarized in Table 1 and presented in Fig. 1. It is evident that relative rate constants of addition of CC14 to cis-C5, C6, C7, C8 and CIO cycloalkenes follows the trend observed for alicyclic systems in addition reactions with a number of free radicals (CH3, CC13, CF2CFzCF3, CH3C0, NCCHCOZCZHS, etc.) [ 11 ] . Relative reactivities of cis-cycloalkenes decreasing in the sequence Cg > CS > C, > C6 > CIO are strongly supported by theoretical calculations [ 11 ] . Table 1 and Fig. 1 show there are small differences in relative reactivities of cycloalkenes when the addition is initiated by a conventional initiator or catalysed by metal complexes.

Nevertheless it can be concluded that relative reactivities of cycloalkenes in addition reactions are mainly controlled by I-strain in the cycloalkene molecule. The type of initiator or catalyst generating the CC13 species had only small effect on their relative reactivities. 3.2. Regioselectivity of addition reactions During study of the reactivity of cycloalkenes it was found that cyclopentene, cyclohexene and cycloheptene give the corresponding 1-chloro-2-trichloromethylcycloalkanes. However, in the case of cis-cyclooctene and cis-cyclodecene, in Table 2 Ratio of vicinal and transannular addition reaction (va) of cis-cycloalkenes with tetrachloromethane in the presence of different catalysts Catalyst Temperature VA ( C) Ca Coo Cu((C2H5)2NH)2CI 22 16:84 96:4 80 12:88 77:23 RuC12(PPh3)3 22 45:55 86:14 80 35:65 61:39 (C6EI5C0)202 80 0:100 50:50 R.

G7 + ~4 .-. + (1) C)~ CCI 3 C CC' 3 The ratio of vicinal to transannular isomers was dependent on the type of catalyst or initiator used. The results are summarized in Table 2. The transannular isomer 1-chloro-4-trichloromethylcyclooctane was the predominant product in the addition reaction of cis-cyclooctene. When benzoyl peroxide was used the product of transannular addition was formed exclusively. In the presence of the copper catalyst and, more markedly, in the presence of the ruthenium catalyst the formation of the product of transannular addition was suppressed ( isomer ratio =12:88 and 35:65, respectively). Others have reported similar findings for reaction in the presence of [ RuC12 ( PPh3 ) 3 ] [ 12 ] . In the case of cis-cyclodecene transannular addition proceeded to a lesser extent and the predominant product of vicinal addition was formed in the presence of the ruthenium catalyst ( isomer, ratio= 61:39 ) and especially in the presence of the copper catalyst ( isomer ratio 77:23 ) . The highest proportion of transannular addition was again observed in the presence of benzoyl peroxide giving an equimolar isomer ratio of vicinal and transannular addition. The lower reaction temperature favours vicinal addition of the both cycloalkenes. Formation of the products of transannular addition is a consequence of intramolecular migration of a radical centre. The results indicate that the migration of the radical centre is significantly suppressed by the metal catalysts. This catalyst effect on the regioselectivity of the additional reaction of cycloalkenes may be explained by the coordination of cycloalkene to the metal centre of the complex, where migration of the reaction centre is more difficult. 3.3. Stereoselectivity of addition reactions It is known that the products of addition reactions of cycloalkenes can exist in the form of both cis and traps isomers. Owing to its stereospecifity, cyclopentane gave only the traps isomer of the 1:1 adduct, in agreement with previous results [ 7 ] . Higher cis-cycloalkenes gave mixture of cis and traps isomers in different ratios. cis-Cycloheptene gave preferentially the traps isomer of the adduct, independent of the type of catalyst or initiator used. For example, for the copper and ruthenium catalysts or benzoyl peroxide the trans:cis isomer ratios were 92:8, 92:8, 90:10, respectively. cis-Cyclooctene and cis-cyclodecene gave a complex mixture of stereo and regioisomers and they were not readily analysed in a stereoselectivity study. Therefore cyclohexene has been chosen as a model compound for the examination of the effect of catalysts on the stereoselectivity of the addition reaction. A 274 R. Davis et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 269-276 number of transition metal complexes have been examined from the point of view of the formation trans:cis isomer ratio of the 1:1 adduct. The results are summarized in Table 3. The lowest stereoselectivity was observed in free radical chain addition initiated by benzoyl peroxide providing an almost equimolar trans:cis isomer ratio ( 52:48 ) in agreement with results reported by Matsumoto ( 53:47 ) [ 9 ] . The highest stereoselectivity of the addition reaction was observed when ruthenium complexes were used as catalysts giving trans:cis isomer mixtures in ratio 82-85:18-15. It is noteworthy that the result observed for the [ RuC12 ( PPh3 ) 3 ] catalyst differs somewhat from that previously reported by Matsumoto [ 9 ] and we have been unable to reproduce the very high stereoselectivity (trans:cis ratio 96:4). Repeating this experiment many times with a range modifications in experimental conditions has led to a trans: cis isomer ratio in the range 81-89:19-11. Nevertheless, the ruthenium catalysts can be considered as the most favourable from the point of view of stereoselectivity, while most of the carbonyl complexes of molybdenum, cobalt and iron were of low selectivity and close to the data obtained with benzoyl peroxide. The copper catalyst also showed only a moderate stereoselectivity. There was no temperature effect on the stereoselectivity observed. At temperatures of 22 C or 80 C the same values of the isomeric ratio were obtained for both the ruthenium and copper catalysts ( 84:16 and 68:32, respectively). The isomeric ratio was also almost independent of the yield of 1:1 adduct. The variation of isomeric ratio was within 5% throughout the range of yields from 1 to 75%. The minor byproducts, 3-trichloromethylcyclohexene and trichloromethylcyclohexane were formed in the presence of most catalysts; their amounts did not exceed 2.6% and 1.9%, respectively, and had negligible effect on the isomeric ratio of adduct. The results presented in Table 3 indicate that the stereoselectivity of the addition reaction may be strongly affected by the type of catalyst. Differences of the trans:cis isomer ratio of the 1:1 adduct in the presence of metal catalysts and benzoyl peroxide are evidently caused by differences in mechanism. Thus the stereoselectivity of the addition reaction may be controlled by the ability of the catalyst to coordinate the reactants.

Reaction of cyclohexene in the presence of (Co2(CO)8J 275 Booth and co-workers [ 10] have reported that the reaction of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as CC14 with [Co2(CO)8] gives [C1Co3(CO)9], cobalt chloride and CZC14. It was also reported that in the presence of cyclohexene, 7,7-dichloronorcarane was formed indicating the formation of dichlorocarbene from the reaction of [Co2(CO)$] and CC14, however the yield of this product was not quantified. We found it surprising that this reaction was not also reported to lead to formation of the 1:1 adduct of cyclohexene and tetrachloromethane, since other alkenehalocarbon addition reactions are known to be promoted by [Co2(CO)g] [ 13]. In our hands the reaction produces a low (2%) yield of the 1:1 adduct (trans:cis ratio = 57:43 ) and circa 0.2% of 7,7-dichloronorcarane. Thus, [ Co2 ( CO ) g ] does indeed promote 1:1 adduct formation, albeit with low efficiency and with an isomer ratio suggestive of a free radical chain pathway rather than one involving coordination. We can also confirm minor formation of 7,7-dichloronorcarone, as previously reported. This is believed to indeed support formation of dichlorocarbene since an independent reaction shows that [Co2(CO)$] does not dechlorinate the 1:1 adduct to produce the norcarane derivative. + CC14 CI M CC13 CI \\ /CI ' 2 -- M + - _ _ \\ (CH?)n_2 ~--- M (CHZ)n-2 X13 ~ \\CCI \\ - / CI M _ _ _ (CH2)n-2 t C1 \\ / 1 - M (CH2)n_2 C13 /Cd 'M (CH 2)n-2 O3 -M + Scheme 1.

Conclusion From the results of this regioselectivity and stereoselectivity study it is evident that transition metal complexes act differently to classical initiators such as dibenzoyl peroxide. While in the presence of organic peroxides, addition reactions proceed by the well known free radical chain mechanism, reactions in the presence of transition metal complexes are more complex. Catalysis by transition metal complexes require coordination of reactants. However, this route is not followed by all metal complexes. Some complexes (e. g., [Co2(CO)g] ) appear to act as initiators rather than catalysts. On the other hand the copper and ruthenium catalysts exhibit significant effects on the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of addition and may be considered as true catalysts in agreement with our previous results [ 4-7,14,15 ] . The proposed non-chain catalytic mechanism of the addition reaction of cycloalkenes with tetrachloromethane can be expressed in a simplified form ( Scheme 1) including the following steps: 1. Oxidative addition of tetrachloromethane to the metal complex. 2. Coordination of cycloalkene to the metal centre. 3. Migratory insertion taking place in the coordination sphere. 4. Reductive elimination of the 1:1 addition product. Acknowledgements The award of a research assistantship (to KS) by Kingston University is gratefully acknowledged. References [ 1 ] W.J. Bland, R.

Reactivity, regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of the addition reaction between tetrachloromethane and C5 to C10 cycloalkenes in the presence of copper, ruthenium, molybdenum, cobalt and iron complexes as catalysts and dibenzoyl peroxide as an initiator have been examined in the temperature range 22 to 80°C. Relative reactivities of the cycloalkenes decreased in sequence C8>C5>C7>C6>C10. These rates were not strongly affected by the catalysts indicating that the reactivities of cycloalkenes are mainly controlled by I-strain in the cycloalkene molecule. Transannular addition was observed in the reactions of cis-cyclooctene and cis-cyclodecene. The ratio of transannular to vicinal addition was significantly lowered by [RuCl2(PPh3)3] and [CuCl(NHEt2)2], in comparison with dibenzoyl peroxide. A strong catalyst effect on the stereoselectivity of the addition reaction of cyclohexene was also recorded. The trans:cis isomer ratio of the adduct was significantly affected by ruthenium catalysts and, to lesser extent, by copper, molybdenum, cobalt and iron catalysts. The catalyst effect on regioselectivity and stereoselectivity strongly support a non-chain mechanism involving coordination of reactants and product formation at the metal centre in contrast to the classical initiation of chain reactions by organic peroxides.

        "dc:description": "Reactivity, regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of the addition reaction between tetrachloromethane and C5 to C10 cycloalkenes in the presence of copper, ruthenium, molybdenum, cobalt and iron complexes as catalysts and dibenzoyl peroxide as an initiator have been examined in the temperature range 22 to 80°C. Relative reactivities of the cycloalkenes decreased in sequence C8>C5>C7>C6>C10. These rates were not strongly affected by the catalysts indicating that the reactivities of cycloalkenes are mainly controlled by I-strain in the cycloalkene molecule. Transannular addition was observed in the reactions of cis-cyclooctene and cis-cyclodecene. The ratio of transannular to vicinal addition was significantly lowered by [RuCl2(PPh3)3] and [CuCl(NHEt2)2], in comparison with dibenzoyl peroxide. A strong catalyst effect on the stereoselectivity of the addition reaction of cyclohexene was also recorded. The trans:cis isomer ratio of the adduct was significantly affected by ruthenium catalysts and, to lesser extent, by copper, molybdenum, cobalt and iron catalysts. The catalyst effect on regioselectivity and stereoselectivity strongly support a non-chain mechanism involving coordination of reactants and product formation at the metal centre in contrast to the classical initiation of chain reactions by organic peroxides.",
