An in situ thermal balance was employed in the study of the reaction and in the TPR of the oxide precursors. A number of catalysts from the same structure with different nickel to aluminum ratios were tested, for comparison with a nickel oxide also prepared by precipitation. All the samples containing aluminum exhibited high activity at a low temperature, yet the nickel oxide had no activity under the same conditions. It has been observed that, as the Ni/A1 ratio increases, the crystallinity of the Feitknecht compound decreases. However, the amount of the carbon fiber formed before the deactivation of the catalyst is proportional to the amount of the nickel in the catalyst. The reduction and the reaction temperatures both have strong effects on the reaction. A small amount of hydrogen in the feed retards fibers formation. At 773 K, the weight of carbon fiber formed on one of the catalysts attained 85 times that of the original unreduced catalyst in the cofeeding of methane and nitrogen. SEM and TEM photographs showed that the carbon fibers formed winding tubes, and their diameters were in the range of 15-69 nm. The shape of the break sections and the existence of dislocations in the fibers suggest that the fibers formed in this work are in accord with the fishbone structure model. 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction Under appropriate conditions, carbon fibers (CFs) can grow on a group VIII base metal catalyst from hydrocarbons [1,2]. Their structure is similar to an ordered graphite and their strength and modulus are even higher than graphite CFs [1,3].

Recent papers reported the unique properties of CGCFs when used as absorbent of hydrocarbons and as catalyst supports [8,9]. Carbon nanotube form- ation was identified in the same catalytic processes [101. Using natural gas passing through a stainless steel tube containing Ni and Cr at 1223-1348 K, Tibbetts got CFs with a length of millimeters to centimeters and a diameter of 5-1000 ~tm [11]. In publications during the 1980s on the purpose of preparation of 46 Y. Li et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997)45-57 CGCFs, high reaction temperature, iron, copper, cobalt and nickel, or their alloys as catalyst, and unsaturated hydrocarbons as feed stocks are recom- mended [7]. Several common conclusions have been drawn: (1) nanometer-sized catalyst particles favor the reaction and result in thin and uniform CFs [12-14]; (2) the uniform lengthening process appears after a short induction period and stops when the catalyst was deactivated; the lengthening rate was controlled either by the dissociate adsorption of hydrocarbons or the solid phase carbon diffusion through the metal particle [ 15,16]; (3) the diameter of the catalyst particle on the tips of the CFs driving the growth reaction is nearly the same as that of the fibers [13,14,17,18]; (4) the suitable growth conditions and the properties of the resulting CFs depend on the size and the chemical nature of the catalyst [19,20]. For the growth from methane, conclusions had been drawn that the length of the CFs increases with its partial pressure and the reaction time [21], and that Fe could grow fibers best in the cofeeding of methane and hydrogen when the reaction temperature is high enough to make its particles almost melt [19,20,22]. Due to the high temperatures used in these works, the gas phase non-catalytic carbon depositions on the wall of the fiber proceed and lead to thickening of the fiber; this non-catalytic carbon has a different structure and lowers the mechanical properties [11]. On the cont- rary, the growth on nickel particles needs lower temperatures, but the deactivation is easier [14]. The investigations on CGCFs were started as early as the appearance of electron microscopes [23]. The early driving force was to limit the whisker formation on some practical catalysts such as steam reforming ones, formation of carbon whiskers or fibers leads to the deactivation and crushing of the catalyst [24]. The formation and the removal of coke from nickel-based reforming catalysts have been reviewed [25,26], and have been a major topic of the catalyst deactivation [27]. However, less literature exists on the purpose of CFs preparation from methane based on the nickel catalyst. Sorensen [28] examined the low temperature activity of CGCF from methane at 763 K and 863 K and the morphology of the nickel particle and the fiber formed [29]. A recent thesis reported that the amount of CFs formed over a nickel catalyst is enough for measuring its bulk mechanical strength. Due to the abundant reserves of natural gas and the low temperature activity of nickel-based catalysts, the authors of this paper favored this system. Neverthe- less, it has been found that the activity of carbon formation from methane is lowest among the different hydrocarbons [25]. To get a high enough reaction rate with this least active molecule, a highly active catalyst is needed, so that a catalyst based on the Feitknecht compound (FC) [30] was designed. From the early 1970s, FC has been used as the precursor of the steam- reforming catalyst [31], and the catalyst for methanol and low alcohol syntheses [32-36]. It has been proved that FC results in highly active catalysts for a lot of reactions [37]. FC was found as natural layered clays [30]; more often it was called hydrotalcite [37]. This kind of compound has brucite-like layers containing octahed- rally coordinated bivalent (e.g., Mg2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Zn2+) and trivalent (e.g., AI3+, Fe3+, Cr3+) cations, as well as interlayer anions (e.g., CO~-, SO4 , NOr, C1 , OH ) and water. In the octahedrally coordinated layer both the bivalent and the trivalent cations are uniformly distributed. After calcination, it loses interlayer anions and water to form well-mixed oxides. Many papers reported that the low temperature calcined material has no identi- fiable component oxide phases [34,36]; however, this metastable mixture can be partly separated at higher calcination temperatures. Based on the nature of the good substitution of the cations, several researchers reported that a paracrystalline metal phase can be formed at proper reduction conditions, in which irre- ducible domains of component oxides such as A120~ exist [38-40]. The metal particle size can be as small as several nanometers and the paracrystallinity of the metal leads to high catalytic activity and stability [37]. The catalyst properties can easily be manipulated by choosing the cations and by changing the calcination and reduction conditions [36,37]. As has been stated, the growth rate, morphology and structure of the CFs are closely related with the energetic conditions of the metal particles [19,20,41]. A nickel-alumina catalyst derived from proper calcination of FC and reduction of the resulting mixed oxides has been tried in the CGCF from methane to be able to control the growth of CF. The preliminary results are included in this paper. Y Li et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 45-57 47 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst samples 2. I. 1. Preparation FC precursors containing Ni2+, A13+ and COz- were prepared by aqueous solution coprecipitation. The mixed salt solution of Ni(NO3)2 and AI(NO3)3 used has a total concentration of metal ions of 1.0 moll1. Na2CO3 with a concentration of 1.0 moll1 was used as the base solution. The precipitate was washed care- fully to remove the Na+, then was dried for 5 h at 393 K in air and was calcined for 10 h at 723 K. The powder thus formed was pressed at 1.5 kbar into cylindrical tablets with a diameter of 8 mm and a length of 10mm. The tablets were crushed to a particle size of 260-270 mesh. A sample of pure NiO was also prepared in the same procedure. 2.1.2. Composition of the samples Table 1 lists the composition and the precursor structure of the catalysts used in this work. 2.2. Characterization A D/MAX-2038 X-ray diffractometer with Fe Kc~ was used to measure the XRD profiles of the catalyst precursors. A PHILIPS-400st TEM and a HITACHI- x-650 SEM were used to obtain the photographs of the CFs, TPR of the samples was carried out with an in situ thermobalance (TB) at a heating rate of 6 K/min and with a total flow of 45 ml/min of 25 vol% of hydrogen and 75 vol% of nitrogen. The amount of catalyst used was 20 mg. 2.3. Reaction conditions The methane and nitrogen used in the experiments were nominally 99.999% pure. The hydrogen was 99.99% in purity. A catalytic oxygen-removing puri- fier was incorporated before the inlet of the reaction unit. The experiments were carried out in a traditional TB. A mixture of methane and nitrogen with a ratio of 1 : 2 was used as the feed, and the total flow was 45 ml/min. The reaction was done at atmospheric pressure. An in situ quartz reactor with a diameter of 20 mm and a length of 160 mm was located in a vertical furnace. The fine catalyst particles were placed in a ~12 mmx 12 mm quartz basket hanging in the middle part of the heated zone. The reactor system was first quenched with nitrogen, and then was heated at a rate of 5 K/min to the reduction tempera- ture 973 K in a gas flow which contained 25 vol% of hydrogen and of 75 vol% nitrogen. The temperature was held about 30 min to allow the catalyst to be reduced. Then the flow of hydrogen was stopped and the temperature in the reactor was adjusted to the reaction temperature in an atmosphere of nitrogen. Afterwards, methane was switched into the reactor and the reaction began. The weights of the CFs and the catalyst were continuously measured by the TB. When the rate of gaining weight became nearly zero, the reaction was ended. The flow of methane was stopped first and nitrogen continued to flow until the quartz reactor was cooled to the ambient temperature. The experiments at a constant heating rate was done with a heating rate of 5 K/min with a constant flow of the mixed gas with the mentioned composition. An experiment was done at a constant temperature of 773 K: at the beginning 0.6 vol% of hydrogen was added into the feed; this flow was stopped after 4 h; and afterwards the increase of the weight was observed. When the amount of CF formed reached 1.5 mg C/rag cat, 0.6 vol% hydrogen was added into the feed again. This experiment will be referred to as hydrogen treating in the following text.

Results and discussions 3.1. The structure and reduction of the precursors 3.1.1. The structure of the precursors\" Fig. 1 shows the XRD profiles of the coprecipitated precursors. It can be seen that sample 1, which has the lowest Ni/AI ratio in the basic salt state (Table 1), has the best crystaUinity in these samples. The first three lines in Fig. 1 of the samples containing both Ni and Al illustrate that the crystallinity of the FC reduces along with the increasing of the Ni/A1 ratio. Sample 3 has a rather high ratio of Ni/A1; however, its crystal structure can be identified as the FC phase, although it is a seriously defective structure. Sample 4, in which there is no aluminum, can only be identified as a structure of poorly crystallized nickel hydroxide car- bonate. After calcination, sample 4 resulted in a nearly perfectly crystallized NiO, which is shown in Fig. 2. The major peaks of sample 1, 2 and 3 are near those of the NiO. There are no peaks of A1203 even with sample 1 which has a rather large ratio of aluminum. It is also indicated that well-crystallized FC resulted in wider peaks of diffraction, which means more defects or distortion of the crystal lattice. Sample 3, which was poorly crystallized FC, resulted in a XRD profile very similar to that of NiO. 3.1.2. TPR of the mixed oxides TPR experiments of the mixed oxides were accom- plished with the in situ TB system. The TPR curves of samples 2 and 4 are depicted in Fig. 3, which shows the weight losses of these samples during the increas- ing of the reduction temperature. It can be observed that the NiO starts losing weight at 344 K, and is reduced very quickly at a temperature of 530 K, and sample 1 L k I I 0 20 40 60 80 100 2O Fig. 1.

But sample 2 which was based on FC starts losing weight at around 433 K; its reduction accelerates after 680 K and finishes at a temperature higher than 970 K. This result shows that, due to a strong interaction between the compo- nents, the nickel-alumina composite catalyst is much more difficult to reduce than the single oxide NiO. It has been calculated that the reduction degree of nickel at 973 K, which is the temperature for the reduction of the most of the samples in this work, is about 98%. 3.2. CGCF on the samples 3.2.1. Results with increasing temperature at a constant rate On sample 2, CF starts to form at 633 K and stops growing at approximately 873 K. The final amount of CF formed is around 42 mg C/rag cat. All the samples with aluminum start to grow CF at comparatively low temperatures and form a considerable amount of CF at the end of the experiment, though samples 1-3 have a slightly different starting temperature, a different rate of growing and a different amount of CF formed at the end of the reaction. On the contrary, under the same conditions, no CF appeared on sample 4 till a tem- perature of 1113 K; it has a pure nickel phase and was prepared from a precursor with a structure of poorly crystallized nickel hydroxide carbonate. The higher temperature activity was not explored for these sam- ples, because the purpose of this work is to examine the low temperature possibility. This result with the pure NiO sample does not exclude the possibility of the short time period of the experiment during the increase of the temperature, which can be still in the range of the induction period of the reaction for this catalyst, as many researchers have observed rather long times of induction up to tens to hundreds of minutes [ 15,16,24,41,42]. It can be concluded that the growth of CF needs a kind of activation of the nickel particles; in this case, the strong interaction between nickel particles and alumina leads to a great change of the energy conditions of Ni particles, and hence leads to the low temperature activity. 3.2.2. Effect of the composition and the crystalliniO, Fig. 4 illustrates the weight gaining process of the first three samples at a fixed temperature of 773 K and the corresponding curves of the growing rate.

The experiments were performed over a time period until the weight gaining rate reduces to a low value. It appears in the figure that the growing rates of samples 1 and 2 exhibit maxima and afterwards reduce rather quickly. On the contrary, sample 3 shows a rather long time of constant rate growing. At the end of the reaction, sample 1 produced 37 mg C/mg cat, sample 2 produced 56mgC/mgcat, and sample 3 produced 85 mg C/rag cat CF, respectively. It should be noted that, in the counting of the amount of CF formed, the mg cat means the original amount of the catalyst before reduction. Although the curvatures of the growing rate of the three samples show considerable differences, the amount of the CF formed at the end of the reactions follows the sequence of the nickel con- tent in the catalyst. A remarkable phenomenon observed with these catalysts based on FC is that there is no existence of induction time, as reported in the literature [14-16,24,41,42]. An interesting result is shown in Fig. 5, in which a correlation between the amount of CF formed at the end of the reaction and the mol ratio of nickel in the catalyst is shown. The three points are in a good straight line. These results prove that, though the crystallinity of the FC precursor in the three samples are very different, the amounts of CF formed are proportional to the nickel amount in the catalyst, which means that the nickel particles exist in the same energetic state in all the samples. There have been arguments about the possible ratios of the divalent and trivalent cations in the structure of FC [37]. Cavani et al. [37] examined statistics of the possible ratios of M2+/M3+ reported in the literature and proposed that the M2+/M3+ in the range of 2-4 is critical for getting a pure FC phase. Combining the results of XRD of the coprecipitates and the mixed oxides with this correlation, these results say that defective FC structure allows a large difference in this ratio. This is consistent with our previous obser- vations with Cu-Zn-A1 based FC [35,36]. Our experi- ences with these FCs strongly support the idea that the ratio of MZ+/M3+ in the structure depends on the coprecipitation conditions. In the present work there are no clues about the mechanism of CF formation and the catalyst deactiva- tion. The interesting phenomenon observed here needs much work to elaborate the roles of the nickel particle size, its energetic state and the possibility of para- crystalline domains formation. We hope to get further understanding in the continuing work of the direct observation of the nickel particles with high resolution electron microscopes and indirect measurement of the energetic state of the components of the catalyst, either in fresh and after-grown state, by XPS and TPR techniques. 100 ,.~ ~ 80 o 0 60 co 0 ._ ,-~ 40 = E 0 E ~ 20 0 /' I I ,,I i 0 20 40 60 80 1 O0 nickel content in the catalyst (mol%) Fig. 5.

The reduction temperature The reduction conditions have a major effect on the energetic state and the crystal size of the nickel particles in the catalyst. Fig. 6 shows the TB curves at a constant reaction temperature 773 K of sample 2 reduced at two different temperatures 773 K and 973 K. In the figure, curve B is nearly the same as that which has been illustrated in Fig. 4; curve A is the result of the sample reduced at a lower temperature. The weight of CF formed on this low-temperature reduced sample till deactivation reached only 22 mg C/mg cat. It can be calculated, with respect to the theoretical content of the volatile components in the structure, from the TPR curve of this sample in Fig. 3 that the reduction degree of the catalyst was about 62% at 773 K and 98% at 973 K, respectively. Low reduction degree means fewer available active nickel particles in the sample. It is interesting that the growth of CF depended only on the nickel particles which are available before the reaction starts, and there is no further activation of the remaining nickel in the strong reduction atmosphere of the reaction. Calculation of the results shows that the low tempera- ture reduced sample utilizes even less than 62% of the nickel which exists in the catalyst. 3.3.2. The reaction temperature Fig. 7 depicts the effect of the reaction temperature on the growth of CF on sample 2. The figure shows that the rate of the growth at 873 K was much faster than the one at 773 K; however, the catalyst deacti- vated rapidly at higher temperature and the amount of CF formed reached only 30 mg C/mg cat. This means that there exists an optimum temperature for CF growth on this catalyst, and supports the general ideas in the literature that the amorphous carbon formed encapsulates the active particle and leads to the deac- tivation and the ending of the reaction [25,41-44]. It is obvious that a very high rate of growing leads to easy encapsulating of the particles. 3.3.3. The feed composition It has been proved that when there was 0.6 vol% of hydrogen in the feed, CF cannot be formed on sample 2 in a constant heating mode until the reaction tem- perature reached 1113 K. An experiment was done afterwards with hydrogen treating of the catalyst by introducing 0.6 vol% of hydrogen in the feed at the beginning of the reaction. In the first 4 h with this feeding composition, there was no CF formed on the catalyst. Upon stopping the flow of hydrogen, an increase of the weight was observed. When the amount of CF formed reached 1.5 mg C/mg cat, 0.6 vol% hydrogen was added into the feed again; CF continued growing, but the growing rate was much lower than under the condition without hydrogen treating. The TB curve of this reaction is given in Fig. 8 for comparison with that of the sample at a condition without introduction of hydrogen. It is interesting to do some more calculations. From the Y.

By supposing that there is only one reaction: CH4~+-~--C + 2H2 (1) in the system and that the CF formed consists of graphite carbon; then the hydrogen formed in the reaction would be approximately 2.6 ml/min (25, 1 atm), which is 5.5 vol% of the total feeding flow of methane and nitrogen. This amount of hydrogen formed from the CF growth reaction is much more than was introduced in the beginning stage of the experiment described. Thus a conclusion could be drawn that the hydrogen in the feed prevents the formation of any \"carbon nucleus\" and its growing in the induction stage and lowers considerably the rate of formation of CF at subsequent times. There is also a possibility that the hydrogen prolongs the induction time. As many publications reported using hydrogen as a dilution gas of methane [7,19,20] when growing CF over group VIII metals at higher temperature than that of this work, this result indicates that a different mechanism may exist for CF growing at low tempera- tures. It has been found that hydrogen accelerates coke 54 ELi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 45-57 A B C Fig. 9. SEM photos of the samples.

In our recent work, we have also observed a different effect of hydrogen with a commercial Ni-based steam-reforming catalyst [45]. These results show that this catalyst from FC precur- sors may have different micro-structures, which may lead to the different behavior in the induction stage and the different effect of hydrogen. 3.4. Morphology of the as-grown fibers Fig. 9 gives the SEM photographs of the selected samples after CGCF at specified conditions. In figure, A is the image of sample 2 after reaction at the described normal conditions: 973 K reduction, 773 K reaction with methane and nitrogen mixed feeding; B is that of same sample but reduced at a lower temperature 773 K; C is that of the same sample after reaction with hydrogen treating. It can be seen that all the CFs in the three images are curved and nanosized in diameter fibers. The growing directions of the fibers are rather random, which may be accounted for by the space competition of the grow- ing. It is interesting to note that the hydrogen treating of the catalyst leads to thicker diameters and less curved structures. Image B, which is the sample reduced at a lower temperature, shows fibers with a thinner diameter and a shorter length, and a grouped texture shows the growing from a particle. This may indicate the heterogeneity of the nickel particles when reduced at lower temperatures. Fig. 10 demonstrates the TEM images of the same samples as in the SEM photography. Photo A was taken from the same sample as A in the SEM mea- surement, which shows that very thin fibers with a diameter close to 15 nm were grown at the same time with the thickest ones with a diameter around 69 nm. Photo B is from the same sample but imaged from a different area, which illustrates that the crystal of the fibers has a lot of dislocations of the crystal planes, characterized by the black points and the easy curva- ture of the fibers. These dislocations could be expected to increase the surface area and the resistivity to fracture upon deformation. Photo C was taken from the low temperature reduction sample, which shows a uniformity of the diameters and the thinner feature than the thicker ones in A and B. D shows the sample with hydrogen treatment at the beginning stage of reaction. This sample has thicker fibers. Several com- mon features should be noted from these TEM obser- vations: (1) these fibers grown on the nickel catalyst seem to be not very brittle, as curved structures are the major state found. (2) a lot of flaws or dislocations can be seen on the tubular structure; (3) the break sections of the fibers has both male conic and female conic shapes; (4) there is no gas phase deposition of carbon on the surface of the fiber or no thickening due to gas phase pyrolysis as reported in Refs. [1,19]; this is because the reaction temperatures used in this work are too low to allow the gas phase pyrolysis reaction to occur; (5) the inner diameter of the hollow structure is rather small and it shows irregularities of internal and Y.

These observations are very different from that of another of our recent works [45], in which a photo taken with a commercial steam-reforming catalyst showed a very thin walled structure where smooth surfaces exist. These observations in this work are in accord with the fishbone model [29] rather than with the layered annular tubes model [ 11,44] of the CGCF structure. Under our experimental conditions, it is difficult to see the fine structure of the tips, though the metal particles are visible. Further understanding of the texture needs higher resolution images. 4. Conclusions The experimental results reveal that when nickel particles are used as CGCF catalyst at low tempera- tures, a strong interaction of it with support oxides such as alumina favors the reaction, while pure nickel prepared in the same procedure with the coprecipi- tated composite catalyst exhibited no activity in the same temperature range. FC is a good precursor for the catalyst of the low temperature CGCF, which after calcination and reduction results in a defective and active nickel phase; this phase has been supposed to be paracrystalline. The irreducible domains such as A1203 are likely the primary reason for the high activity of this catalyst. This catalyst needs no induc- tion time when a feed of mixed methane and nitrogen is used. The FC formed at chosen conditions in this paper exhibited differences in crystallinity as the variation of the nickel to aluminum ratio; however, these FCs in different crystallinity states could have a uniform distribution of the bivalent and trivalent cations. When the CGCF reaction was performed at the same activation and reaction conditions, the amount of the fiber formed at the end of the reaction or until the deactivation of the catalyst was propor- tional to the amount of nickel in the catalyst. This indicates that the nickel in different samples has the same energetic state. The catalysts prepared from FC precursor show a high activity and produce a comparatively large amount of CF at a temperature as low as 773 K. The reduction and reaction temperatures and the feed composition all have a profound effect on the CGCF reaction. Higher reaction temperature leads to a higher rate and a quick deactivation. Lower reduction tem- perature leads to less available nickel, and the nickel unreduced before the reaction starts makes no con- tribution to the formation of CE Under the conditions employed in this work, a small amount of hydrogen at the beginning of the reaction in the feed prevents the formation of CE The morphology study of the CFs by SEM and TEM illustrates that the CFs formed under these conditions have a curved hollow tubular shape and have a diameter in the range of 15-69 nm. A lot of dislocations of the CFs crystal can be seen from TEM images; these allow the curvature and bending in a large angle of the CFs. The break sections have both male and female conic shapes, which suggest the fishbone growth model of the carbon. The reaction and reduction conditions both have influence on the morphology of the CFs. Acknowledgements This work was supported in part by NSF of China. References [1] G.G. Tibbetts, M.

Catalytic growth of carbon fibers from methane on a nickel-alumina composite catalyst prepared from Feitknecht compound precursor Yongdan Li * Jiuling Chen Liu Chang Department of Chemical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China * Corresponding author. A nickel-alumina catalyst prepared from Feitknecht compound was used in the catalytic growth of carbon fibers from methane. An in situ thermal balance was employed in the study of the reaction and in the TPR of the oxide precursors. A number of catalysts from the same structure with different nickel to aluminum ratios were tested, for comparison with a nickel oxide also prepared by precipitation. All the samples containing aluminum exhibited high activity at a low temperature, yet the nickel oxide had no activity under the same conditions. It has been observed that, as the Ni/Al ratio increases, the crystallinity of the Feitknecht compound decreases. However, the amount of the carbon fiber formed before the deactivation of the catalyst is proportional to the amount of the nickel in the catalyst. The reduction and the reaction temperatures both have strong effects on the reaction. A small amount of hydrogen in the feed retards fibers formation. At 773 K, the weight of carbon fiber formed on one of the catalysts attained 85 times that of the original unreduced catalyst in the cofeeding of methane and nitrogen. SEM and TEM photographs showed that the carbon fibers formed winding tubes, and their diameters were in the range of 15–69 nm. The shape of the break sections and the existence of dislocations in the fibers suggest that the fibers formed in this work are in accord with the fishbone structure model.
