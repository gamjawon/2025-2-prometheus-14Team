Graphical abstract The reaction mechanism of ethanol synthesis from dimethyl ether (DME) and syngas was studied via density functional theory calculations. Various possible pathways for ethanol formation, and byproduct formations of methanol, acetic acid, methane, carbon dioxide, and water over an active cobalt stepped surface were calculated. The most favorable pathway for ethanol synthesis starts with the dissociation of dimethyl ether to CH2, followed by carbon monoxide insertion to form CH2CO, and then undergoes successive hydrogenations to give ethanol. CH3CHO hydrogenation to CH3CHOH becomes the rate–determining step with a reaction barrier of 1.48eV. DME decomposition and CH2 carbonylation occur easily with low barriers of 0.61eV and 0.48eV, respectively. Carbon monoxide insertion into CH2 is more facile than into CH3 and CH. Hydrogenation at the carbon atom occurs prior to the oxygen atom in the order of α–carbon>carbonyl carbon>oxygen. The calculations demonstrate that ethanol synthesis via DME carbonylation and hydrogenation is thermodynamically favored and is kinetically faster than that via syngas direct synthesis. Methane and acetic acid are two dominant competing byproducts. Keywords Density functional theory Ethanol Dimethyl ether Syngas Carbonylation 1 Introduction Biomass–derived ethanol (CH3CH2OH) has been recognized as an alternative fuel to traditional fossil fuels since that its raw material, biomass, is renewable and abundant on the earth. The increasing utilization of ethanol as motor fuel will reduce CO2 emission. Because of the easy and lowcost production of syngas via biomass gasification, direct CH3CH2OH synthesis from syngas (CO+H2) has been studied widely [1–4]. Four categories of heterogeneous catalysts have been tested and optimized: modified Fischer–Tropsch synthesis catalysts (cobalt–based or iron–based), modified methanol synthesis catalysts (copper–based), modified molybdenum–based catalysts, and rhodium–based catalysts [4]. However, drawbacks of severe reaction conditions, low onepass CO conversion, and low CH3CH2OH selectivity has inhibited its industrial application. Recently, an improved method for CH3CH2OH synthesis from dimethyl ether (DME) and syngas has been proposed [5–7]. The synthesis involves the simultaneous or stepwise reactions of DME vapor–phase carbonylation and hydrogenation. It is considered a promising technology because of the high reaction activity and the efficient production of DME and syngas feedstock from renewable biomass. Iglesia and coworkers found that HMOR and HFER catalyzed DME carbonylation to methyl acetate had stable rates and more than 99% selectivity at 423463K, and the rate of DME carbonylation was much higher than that of CH3OH carbonylation [8,9]. Tsubaki and coworkers reported that DME was converted completely with a CH3CH2OH selectivity of 48.4% in the onestep CH3CH2OH synthesis from DME, CO, and H2 over affordable HMOR and Cu/ZnO dual catalysts [5–7,10,11]. Lu et al. used different noble metals (Pt, Pd, and Ru) to impregnate HMOR and to promote the catalytic activity of CH3CH2OH synthesis from DME and syngas, and they found that the combination of 0.4wt% Pt/HMOR and Cu/ZnO catalyst presented excellent catalytic performance [12]. We have studied DME carbonylation over metalmodified HMOR catalysts (Cu, Ni, Co, Zn and Ag), and found that the catalytic performances of Co, Cu, and Ni modified HMOR were better than the performance of HMOR [13]. The activity of Co was comparable with that of Cu in DME conversion (close to 100%) and methyl acetate selectivity (higher than 99%), which shows the effectiveness of Co for DME carbonylation. Bartek et al. reported that CH3CH2OH/acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) selectivities were promoted significantly when Cobased catalysts were used in the reductive carbonylation of DME [14]. Co is highly active for ester and aldehyde hydrogenation to produce alcohols [15–17]. Co catalysts are considered as promising candidates for CH3CH2OH synthesis from DME and syngas via synergic carbonylation and hydrogenation. In this work, we study the mechanism of CH3CH2OH synthesis from DME and syngas over a Co catalyst via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A stepped surface was used in the calculation because it is recognized as the most active site of transition metals for heterogeneous catalytic reactions [18,19]. Adsorptions of key intermediates were firstly calculated to identify their preferred surface adsorption geometries. Then the elementary reactions for DME decomposition, subsequent CO insertion into CH x (x =1–3) and successive hydrogenation to CH3CH2OH, and the competing reactions of direct CO hydrogenation to CH3OH and CH3CH2OH were calculated. Acetic acid (HOAc), CO2, water (H2O), and methane (CH4) byproduct formations were also considered. Finally, the most likely reaction pathways for CH3CH2OH, CH3OH, HOAc, and CH4 were identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study that presents thermodynamic and kinetic reaction barriers of CH3CH2OH synthesis from DME and syngas. 2 Computational Methods All spin–polarized periodic DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna Abinitio Simulation Package (VASP) [20–22], and the Perdew–BurkeErnzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient correction (GGA) was used to treat exchange and correlation effects. The core electrons of all atoms were described by the projector–augmented wave pseudopotential, and the energy cutoff was 400 eV. MonkhorstPack k–point mesh of 6×6×6 and 3×3×1 for bulk and surface calculations were used to sample the Brillouin zone. The Fermi level was smeared using the MethfesselPaxton method with a width of 0.1eV. The electronic selfconsistent field converged to 1×10−4 eV and forces on all atoms converged to less than 0.05eV/Å. A fcc Co close-packed unit cell with an original lattice constant of 3.544Å was selected and optimized by a conjugate-gradient algorithm. The calculated equilibrium bulk lattice constant for Co is 3.524Å, which agrees well with theoretical (3.521Å) and experimental values (3.545Å) [23,24]. Co steps were modeled by using a fourlayerthick slab of 3×3 Co(111) surface supercell, from which two closedpacked rows were removed to form a step. The atoms of the bottom two layers were fixed in the bulk positions, whereas the others were allowed to relax to their lowestenergy configurations. A vacuum space of 15Å was applied to avoid the interaction between the slab and its images. The side and top views of the model Co stepped surface are shown in Fig. 1 . The transition states (TS) were determined by the climbing nudged elasticband method (CINEB) [25,26]. This method gives a precise estimate of the saddle point with a small modification of the regular efficient NEB method. It has been widely used for TS searching and the minimum energy path finding [18,23,27–30]. In our calculation, an elastic band with 8 structural images along the path of the initial state (IS) and the final state (FS) of each elementary reaction were constructed by linear interpolation. A spring interaction between adjacent images was added to ensure continuity of the path, and optimized using quick-min algorithm. After being converged, the image with the highest energy (TS) was not affected by the spring forces at all. The TS structures were further confirmed by vibrational frequency analysis and determining that only a single imaginary frequency presented along the proper reaction coordinate. All vibrational frequencies were calculated by allowing the entirety of the adsorbed species on the surface to fully relax while all the Co atoms were kept fixed. The reaction rate constants were calculated using the harmonic transition-state theory. The adsorption energy ΔE ads is defined as ΔE ads = E ads/slab −E slab − E gas, where E ads/slab is the total energy of the slab with adsorbates, E slab is the slab energy, and E gas is the energy of adsorbates in the gas phase. The reaction energy (ΔH) and activation energy (Ea ) are defined as ΔH = E FS −E IS, and Ea = E TS − E IS, respectively. E IS, E TS, and E FS are the total energies of the IS, TS, and FS, respectively. 3 Results 3.1 Adsorptions of Intermediates Adsorption geometries of some key reaction intermediates on the Co stepped surface are presented in Fig. 2 . The corresponding adsorption geometrical parameters, configurations, and adsorption energies are listed in Table 1 . The nomenclature ηi–μj was used to designate i atoms of the adsorbate bound to j atoms on the metal surface. Saturated species, dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3), CH3OH, and CH3CH2OH, have small adsorption energies that range from −0.42 to −0.62eV, and which demonstrate weak binding to the surface. The adsorptions are induced by the lone pair electrons of O atoms in those adsorbates, forming η1–μ1(O) configurations with an O–sCo distance of 2.09–2.14Å (Figs. 2(a–c)). For CH3CHO and HCHO (Fig. 2(d,e)), the adsorption energy increases to −1.42 and −1.59eV, respectively, and give stronger binding to the surface than that of CH3OCH3, CH3OH, and CH3CH2OH. This can be ascribed to a relatively strong d–π interactions between the d orbital of sCo atoms and the π bond of CO in CH3CHO and HCHO. Both η2–μ2(C,O) configurations were generated with an O atom located at the bridge site and a carbonyl C atom located at the top site of the sCo atoms. The O–sCo distances are shortened by ∼0.15Å compared with those of CH3OCH3, CH3OH, and CH3CH2OH species. Unsaturated species bind strongly to the surface through stepped Co atoms with adsorption energies that range from −2.02 to −4.00eV, which are larger than the saturated species. The CH3OCH species is the moststrongly adsorbed intermediates on the surface with binding energy of −4.00eV. The corresponding configuration is η1–μ2(C). With the elimination of hydrogen atoms and a decreasing symmetry for CH3OCH3 decomposition intermediates (Figs. 2(a, f–h)), the adsorption sites change from oxygen to carbon atoms and the corresponding adsorption configurations follow η1–μ1(O)→η2–μ2(C,O)→η1–μ2(C). The reason may be assigned to the favorable formation of a tetrahedral bonding geometry for carbon atoms on the surface [31]. The adsorption of COH on the surface is strong. The C atom located at the bridge site is linked to two sCo atoms on the stepped surface, giving a η1–μ2(C) configuration (Fig. 2(n)). The corresponding adsorption energy is −3.84eV with d C– s Co of 1.81 and 1.82Å. The alkoxide species, CH3O and CH3CH2O are also two strong adsorption intermediates, which have the binding energies of −3.55 and −3.52eV, respectively. The resulting binding configurations are η1–μ2(O) (Figs. 2(i) and (o)). The binding atoms change from carbon to oxygen compared with COH. The length of O sCo bonds for CH3O and CH3CH2O are 1.92 and 1.93Å, respectively, which are 0.11Å longer than that for d C– s Co in COH. Both CH3CHOH and CH2OH have the adsorption configurations of η2–μ2(C,O) through their unsaturated C atoms and hydroxyl O atoms on the surface, while CHOH is linked to the surface through its C atom only to give a η1–μ2(C) configuration. The calculated configurations are in good agreement with the previous DFT results [29,32]. It can be ascribed to that with the increase of the valence saturation of C atom (the maximum is 4) in adsorbates, the adsorption induced by C atom becomes weaker and weaker, while that induced by O atom becomes dominant. The O and unsaturated C atoms are competitive adsorption on the surface, with C being preferred. Here, the saturation of active C in CH3CHOH and CH2OH are 3, and that for CHOH is 2. Similarly, for CH3OCH2 and CH3OCH, the saturations of active C (in CH2 and CH groups) are 3 and 2, respectively. Therefore, CH3OCH2 binds to the surface through its C and O atoms together to form η2–μ2(C,O) configuration, while CH3OCH binds to the surface through C atom only to form η1–μ2(C) configuration. It also happens for CH3OC. On the other hand, as discussed above, the species with completely saturated C, like CH3OCH3, CH3CH2OH, and CH3OH, are bonding to the surface through the atomic O only. Given that, it can be concluded that with atomic C saturation, in general, the adsorption configuration changes from C binding to CO binding, and finally to O binding. 3.2 Elementary Reactions In this section, we investigated each elementary reaction involved in DME decomposition; subsequent carbonylation and hydrogenation for CH3OH and CH3CH2OH synthesis; and HOAc, CH4, CO2, and H2O byproduct formations. Potential energy surfaces for the most likely reaction pathways are discussed and depicted. The obtained geometries of all TS and their imaginary frequencies are presented in the Supporting Information. 3.2.1 DME Decomposition A schematic of DME decomposition on a Co stepped surface is presented in Fig. 3 . Activation energies, reaction energies, and geometries of transition states are also provided. DME (CH3OCH3) decomposition starts from dehydrogenation to give CH3OCH2 with a low activation energy of 0.48eV. The reaction is exothermic by −0.25eV. The cleaving OH bond in TS1 is elongated from 1.11Å to 1.38Å. CH3OCH2 has two compatible dissociation reactions: OCH2 scission to give CH3O and CH2 with a barrier of 0.61eV, and dehydrogenation from the CH2 group to give CH3OCH with a barrier of 0.58eV. Both low reaction barriers demonstrate the readily formation of CH2 and CH3OCH intermediates. The energy barrier difference for those two reactions is as low as 0.03eV. The corresponding reaction heat for OCH2 scission is strongly exothermic by −0.80eV, and that for dehydrogenation is slightly endothermic by 0.12eV, showing a large difference. As a result, CH3OCH2 dissociation via OCH2 scission to give CH2 is thermodynamically and kinetically favored. The CO bond is elongated significantly by 0.51Å to 2.12Å in TS2. For the dehydrogenation, the OH bond is elongated by 0.52Å to 1.63Å in TS3. As a CH3OCH2 dehydrogenation product, CH3OCH might undergo decomposition via OCH cleavage to give CH3O and CH (Ea =0.51eV) and/or dehydrogenation at CH to give CH3OC and H (Ea =0.31eV). Both reactions are exothermic, with −1.23eV versus −0.22eV, respectively. The dehydrogenation is slightly kinetically preferred, whereas the OCH cleavage is strongly thermodynamically favored. The following decomposition of CH3OC via CH3OC scission has a reaction barrier of 0.63eV. Based on the above results of kinetic reaction barriers and thermodynamic reaction energies for possible elementary reactions of DME decomposition, it is clear that DME can be converted easily to give CH2 and CH via CO scissions after dehydrogenation on the Co stepped surface. CH2 formation is even preferred due to its low reaction barrier and strongly exothermic in the early step of DME decomposition. 3.2.2 Ethanol and Methanol Synthesis The reaction network of CH3CH2OH and CH3OH synthesis via carbonylation and hydrogenation from DME and CO is shown in Fig. 4 . Adsorbed H2 is easily dissociated on the Co surface with an extremely low reaction barrier of 0.03eV, supplying adequate H intermediates for the hydrogenation reactions. H2 dissociation is also thermodynamically favored with a mild exothermicity of −0.55eV. Intermediates of COH and CHO are two products of CO hydrogenation at its O and C atoms, respectively. Both reactions are strongly endothermic (1.54 and 0.91eV, respectively). COH formation is energetically unlikely because of its extremely high barrier of 2.13eV. The energy barrier for CHO formation is 0.93eV, which is 1.20eV lower than that for COH formation, and indicates that the first hydrogenation of CO at the C atom to give CHO is preferred rather than the hydrogenation at the O atom to give COH. This agrees well with published results of CO hydrogenation to CHO and COH over Cu and Rh surfaces [29,33,34]. The reported activation energy of COH formation (1.89–2.07eV) was found to be much higher than that of CHO formation (0.88–1.26eV). Similarly, for the further hydrogenation of CHO, the addition of H to C atom to form HCHO is more favorable than the addition to O atom to form CHOH, since the barrier for the former is 0.72eV lower than the later (0.38eV versus 1.10eV). HCHO formation is almost thermoneutral. In addition, it is interesting to find that the reaction barrier for CHO deoxygenation to CH is relatively low by 0.63eV, which is a small 0.25eV higher than HCHO formation, suggesting the easy deoxygenation of CHO. This reaction is mildly exothermic by −0.38eV. CHO hydrogenation to HCHO and deoxygenation to CH are two compatible and preferable reactions for CHO conversion. The intermediate of HCHO may undergo three reactions: two hydrogenations at the C and O atoms to form CH3O and CH2OH, respectively, and one deoxygenation to form CH2. The corresponding activation energies are 0.25, 1.04, and 0.85eV, respectively, in which CH3O formation is energetically preferred. CH3O and CH2 formations are exothermic, whereas the formation of CH2OH is endothermic. The subsequent hydrogenation of CH3O results in CH3OH formation. However, the reaction has a high activation energy of 1.67eV and a strong endothermicity of 1.03eV, which implies the unlikely formation of CH3OH and the relative stability of CH3O species on the surface. This is consistent with a strong binding of CH3O to the surface. The barrier for CH3O deoxygenation to CH3 is high to 1.46eV, which indicates that CH3 production from CO is difficult. The formation of CH3OH via sequent hydrogenation starts from CHOH at an unsaturated C atom has a relatively low reaction barrier (0.40, 0.80eV) and is nearly thermoneutral. Consequently, for direct CO hydrogenation to CH3OH, it is clear that the hydrogenation at carbon atom is energetically preferred over the hydrogenation at oxygen atom. Studt et al. also found that hydrogenation of the oxygen end involved intermediates of COH, HCOH, and H2COH, is associated with much higher barriers, and that all intermediates are higher in energy than their carbonhydrogenated counterparts [34]. According to the above discussion of direct CO hydrogenation, intermediates of CH, CH2, and CH3 are produced by direct deoxygenation of CHO, CH2O, and CH3O with reaction barriers of 0.63, 0.85, and 1.46eV, respectively. All these three deoxygenation reactions are exothermic. CH2 and CH are also predominant products of DME decomposition via CO scissions with relatively low reaction barriers (∼0.60eV). To produce CH3CH2OH, subsequent CO insertions into these CH x (x =1−3) are essential and vital. CO insertions of CH, CH2, and CH3 to form CHCO, CH2CO, and CH3CO have activation energies of 0.64, 0.48, and 1.11eV with an increasing endothermicity of 0.03, 0.29, and 0.54eV, respectively. The formation of CH2CO has the lowest reaction barrier, which indicates that the insertion of CO into CH2 is most likely to occur. In addition to this most preferred reaction, CHCO formation is an energetically close reaction because of a slight barrier difference of 0.16eV. Compared with CH2CO and CHCO, CH3CO formation has a much higher reaction barrier, which shows that it is more difficult to produce directly by CO insertion of CH3. However, CH3CO is favorable to be generated by the hydrogenation at the α–carbon of CHCO and CH2CO. The reaction barriers are relatively low at 0.49 and 0.29eV for CHCO hydrogenation to CH2CO and CH2CO hydrogenation to CH3CO, respectively. These reactions are exothermic by −0.42 and −0.23eV, respectively, which implies that both reactions are kinetically and thermodynamically preferred. With respect to CO insertion, competing reactions for CH x conversion are their direct hydrogenations. The highest reaction barrier is 0.85eV, which is associated with hydrogenation of CH3 to form CH4. This reaction has a mild endothermicity of 0.33eV. The length of forming CH bond is 1.57Å at TS, consistent with the reported DFT result (1.54Å) [27]. The lowest barrier in CH x hydrogenation is CH2 hydrogenation to CH3 (Ea =0.28eV) which is mildly exothermic by −0.37eV. The barrier for CH hydrogenation to CH2 is 0.30eV with a mild exothermicity of −0.56eV. Wang et al. carried out DFT calculations of ethanol decomposition on Co(0001) surface, which can be treated as a reverse reaction of ethanol formation, and found that the barriers for CH2, CH3, and CH4 formations were 0.44, 0.46, and 0.99eV, which are similar to our results [27]. The relatively low reaction barriers obtained in these CH x hydrogenation reactions imply the readily formation of CH4. This result agrees with experimental observations of alcohol synthesis from syngas, for which CH4 is recognized as an easily generated byproduct [35–37]. In addition to hydrogenation at the α–carbon, another favored hydrogenation site for CHCO, CH2CO, and CH3CO is the carbonyl carbon. The reactions for CH2CO hydrogenation to CH2CHO and CH3CO hydrogenation to CH3CHO have relatively low barriers of 0.48 and 0.31eV, respectively. Both reactions are exothermic (−0.49 and −0.24eV, respectively). Therefore, hydrogenation at the carbonyl carbon is kinetically and thermodynamically preferable for CH2CO and CH3CO. However, the hydrogenation of CHCO to CHCHO is not favored because of its relatively high reaction barrier of 1.02eV compared with the hydrogenations of CHCO and CH2CO. Although the formation of CHCHO is difficult, its transformation via hydrogenation is easy. CHCHO undergoes a two–step hydrogenation to CH3CHO through CH2CHO with low activation energies of 0.30eV (CHCHO+H→CH2CHO) and 0.41eV (CH2CHO+H→CH3CHO). Sites for H addition are both α–carbon. Consequently, CH3CHO intermediates are likely generated through CO insertions into CH and CH2 followed by hydrogenations. Further hydrogenation of CH3CHO will produce two intermediates of CH3CH2O and CH3CHOH with the reaction barriers of 0.30 and 1.48eV, respectively. The formation of CH3CH2O is exothermic by −0.36eV, whereas CH3CHOH formation is endothermic by 0.73eV. Thus, hydrogenation at the carbonyl carbon atom of CH3CHO to CH3CH2O is more likely than hydrogenation at the oxygen atom to CH3CHOH. However, CH3CH2O hydrogenation at the oxygen atom to CH3CH2OH is both kinetically and thermodynamically unfavored due to its extremely high reaction barrier of 1.73eV and its strongly endothermicity of 1.05eV. The reason may be ascribed to the extremely strong adsorption of CH3CH2O species (–3.52eV) on the surface, which will suppress its reaction with vicinal H atoms. This is consistent with the calculation carried out by Wang et al., in which the reaction of CH3CH2O+H→CH3CH2OH also has a high barrier of 1.41eV and is endothermic by 0.62eV [27]. The length of changing OH bond at TS in our calculation on Co stepped surface is 1.40Å, the same as that on Co(0001) surface [27]. In contrast with CH3CH2O hydrogenation, hydrogenation of CH3CHOH at the α–carbon to form CH3CH2OH is energetically facilitated with a relatively low activation energy of 0.66eV and an exothermicity of −0.17eV. As a result, the highest reaction barriers for CH3CH2OH formation from CH3CHO mediated CH3CHOH and CH3CH2O are 1.48eV (CH3CHO+H→CH3CHOH) versus 1.73eV (CH3CH2O+H→CH3CH2OH), which suggests that CH3CHOH mediated path for CH3CH2OH formation is energetically preferred over that of CH3CH2O mediated path. Liu et al. suggested that ethanol synthesis from syngas on Rh(111) surface goes through intermediates of CH3CHOH [38]. Zuo et al. also reported that the route for CH3CH2OH formation from syngas on the Cu/ZnO catalyst involved the vital steps of CH3CHO→CH3CHOH→CH3CH2OH [3]. Another possible route for CH3CH2OH formation with CH3CO hydrogenation through CH3COH and CH3CHOH was also considered. The highest activation energy in this route is 1.42eV (CH3CO+H→CH3COH), which is 1.11eV higher than that of CH3CO+H→CH3CHO. The reaction is endothermic by 0.46eV. Subsequent hydrogenation of CH3COH to form CH3CHOH has low activation energy of 0.47eV, associated with a slight endothermicity of 0.23eV. 3.2.3 Acetic Acid Synthesis Reaction networks for the conversion of O species and the formation of dominant byproducts, HOAc, are presented in Fig. 5 . According to the above analysis, O intermediates can be produced easily from CO by direct deoxygenation of CHO and HCHO with low activation energies of 0.63eV (CHO→O+CH) and 0.85eV (HCHO→O+CH2), respectively. By reacting with H, O will be converted to OH with a high activation energy of 1.04eV and a mild exothermicity of −0.42eV. Meanwhile, a parallel reaction of O with CO to give CO2 (Ea =1.05eV) will occur because of its close reaction barrier to that of OH formation. This reaction is endothermic by 0.27eV. OH intermediates undergo further hydrogenation to H2O and CO insertion to COOH with high activation energies of 1.68eV and 1.87eV, respectively. Both reactions are strongly endothermic by more than 1eV. Therefore, OH conversions with H and CO are not preferred. O and OH intermediates are anticipated to carry out oxidation reactions to form carboxylic acid HOAc. The oxidation reactions here are supposed to start from CHCO, CH2CO, and CH3CO, which are identified as active intermediates in the reaction network of CH3CH2OH synthesis. All three intermediates may undergo direct addition of OH or two–step additions of O and H. Formations of CHCOOH, CH2COOH, and CH3COOH via direct OH addition of CHCO, CH2CO, and CH3CO have activation energies of 1.10, 0.41, and 0.99eV, respectively. Among these three reactions, CH2COOH formation (CH2CO+OH→CH2COOH) is kinetically preferred because of its relatively low reaction barriers. The reactions of CHCOOH and CH3COOH formations are mildly endothermic by 0.54 and 0.50eV, respectively, whereas that for CH2COOH formation is exothermic by −0.49eV. As a consequence, CH2COOH formation is also thermodynamically facilitated. Activation energies for O additions into CHCO and CH3CO at carbonyl carbon atoms to generate CHCOO and CH3COO are 0.98 and 0.73eV, respectively. Whereas the addition of O into CH2CO to form CH2COO has a low activation energy of 0.40eV, which is 0.58 and 0.33eV lower than the other two reactions. This reaction is mildly exothermic by −0.42eV. Consequently, oxidations of CH2CO to CH2COO and/or CH2COOH are more likely than oxidations of CHCO and CH3CO. Reaction barriers for the further hydrogenations of CHCOO and CH2COO to CHCOOH and CH2COOH are 0.75 and 0.61eV, respectively, implying an energetic preference of CH2COO+H→CH2COOH. The hydrogenation of CH3COO to CH3COOH has an extremely high reaction barrier of 1.62eV, which is strongly endothermic by 1.05eV and makes the transformation of CH3COO to CH3COOH difficult. The barrier for CH3COOH formation via CH2COOH hydrogenation is 0.34eV lower than that of via CH3COO hydrogenation. Given that, we conclude that CH3COOH formation is likely starting from CH2CO oxidation rather than that from CHCO and CH3CO oxidations. Because of the high activation barrier of OH formation (O+H→OH), CH2CO oxidation with O is more favored than that with OH. 4 Discussion 4.1 Preferred Pathways for Ethanol Synthesis Four preferred reaction pathways for CH3CH2OH synthesis via DME carbonylation and hydrogenation on a Co stepped surface are shown in Fig. 6 . As discussed in Section 3.2.1, for P1 and P2 pathways during DME decomposition, the steps with the highest reaction barriers are CH3OCH2 →CH3O+CH2 (Ea =0.61eV). After that, carbonylation occurs via CO insertion to generate an active intermediate of ketene CH2CO. The carbonylation reaction occurs easily because of its low energy barrier of 0.48eV. The following successive hydrogenations of CH2CO to produce final CH3CH2OH in both P1 and P2 proceed through intermediates of CH3CHO and CH3CHOH. The highest reaction barriers during the hydrogenation are both 1.48eV and are associated with CH3CHOH formation (CH3CHO+H→CH3CHOH), which is also the highest barrier in entire P1 and P2 pathways. The difference between P1 and P2 is the starting hydrogenation site of CH2CO. In P1, CH2CO hydrogenation is performed at the α–carbon to form CH3CO (CH2CO+H→CH3CO, Ea =0.29eV). In P2, it is performed at the carbonyl carbon to form CH2CHO (CH2CO+H→CH2CHO, Ea =0.48eV). The barrier of the later reaction is 0.19eV higher than that of the former reaction. CH3CHO formations via hydrogenations of CH3CO (P1) and CH2CHO (P2) have energy barriers of 0.31 and 0.41eV, respectively. As a result, it is clear that the hydrogenation of CH2CO→CH3CO→CH3CHO in P1 has lower reaction barriers than the hydrogenation of CH2CO→CH2CHO→CH3CHO in P2. Therefore, P1 is more kinetically favored than P2. In addition to CH2 in P1 and P2, CH is another dominant product of DME decomposition in P3 and P4. It is produced through CH3OCH3 →CH3OCH2 →CH3OCH→CH. The highest barrier is 0.58eV (CH3OCH2 →CH3OCH+H). This is close to the highest barrier for CH2 formation in P1 and P2 (CH3OCH2 →CH3O+CH2, Ea =0.61eV). Subsequent carbonylation occurs via CO insertion into CH with a barrier of 0.64eV (CH+CO→CHCO), which is 0.16eV higher than the barrier of CH2 +CO→CH2CO in P1 and P2. Similar to CH2CO, CHCO prefers to be hydrogenated at the α–carbon to CH2CO in P3 and P4 rather than to be hydrogenated at the carbonyl carbon. The reason is that the barrier of α–carbon hydrogenation (CHCO+H→CH2CO, Ea =0.49eV) is much lower than that of carbonyl carbon hydrogenation (CHCO+H→CHCHO, Ea =1.02eV). The hydrogenations of CH2CO to produce final CH3CH2OH in P3 and P4 are the same as those to P1 and P2, respectively. The highest reaction barrier in the hydrogenation is also 1.48eV as associated with CH3CHOH formation, which is also the highest barrier over the entire pathways. Therefore the rate–determining steps (RDSs) for the four P1–P4 pathways are all CH3CHO+H→CH3CHOH. Additionally, similar to P1 and P2, P3 is preferable over P4. Although the RDSs are the same and barriers for DME decomposition are energetically close, P1 has an even lower reaction barrier than P3 for the vital CO insertion reaction (0.48eV versus 0.64eV), which implies that P1 is further preferred over P3. Therefore, we conclude that in these four competing pathways, P1 is the most kinetically favorable pathway for CH3CH2OH synthesis which starts from DME decomposition, followed by carbonylation and hydrogenation on the Co stepped surface. Nevertheless, the other three pathways P2–P4 are also feasible and are likely to occur since the difference in reaction barriers between P1 and P2–P4 is less than 0.20eV. 4.2 Preferred Pathways for Byproduct Formation As shown in Fig. 4, the kinetically preferred pathway for CH2 formation from CO is CO→CHO→CH→CH2. The highest barrier is 0.93eV, which is associated with the first CO hydrogenation step and is 0.32eV higher than the highest barrier of CH2 formation in P1 (CH3OCH3 →CH3OCH2 →CH2 →CH2CO→CH3CO→CH3CHO→CH3CHOH→CH3CH2OH). Consequently, CH2 formation via CO hydrogenation is more difficult than its formation via DME decomposition. In the CO route, the ensuing favored carbonylation and hydrogenations for CH2 to produce CH3CH2OH are the same as that of P1. The RDS is also CH3CHO+H→CH3CHOH over the entire CH3CH2OH synthesis pathway. Therefore, the most likely pathway for CH3CH2OH synthesis via direct CO hydrogenation, P(CO), is CO→CHO→CH→CH2 →CH2CO→CH3CO→CH3CHO→CH3CHOH→CH3CH2OH. To compare the formation routes of CH3CH2OH from DME and from syngas, the forward reaction rate constants of the steps involved in the pathways of P1 and P(CO) were listed in Table 2 . It is shown that the slowest reaction both in P1 and P(CO) is CH3CHO+H→CH3CHOH. Its rate constants are low to 8.54×10−3, 2.49×10−1, 4.05×100, and 4.22×101 s −1 at 473, 523, 573, and 623K, respectively. Therefore, this step is confirmed as the rate-determining step in CH3CH2OH synthesis. Additionally, as discussed above, the difference for P1 and P(CO) is the route for CH2 formation. For P1, CH2 formation is determined by CH3OCH2 →CH3O+CH2. For P(CO), CH2 formation is determined by CO+H→CHO. The corresponding rate constants for those two reactions at 573K are 3.02×108 and 1.51×104 s −1, respectively, which shows that CH2 formation in P1 is 4 orders of magnitude faster than that in P(CO). Therefore, CH3CH2OH synthesis via P1 is significantly faster than that via P(CO). The most likely pathway for CH3OH synthesis from CO is CO→CHO→HCHO→CH2OH→CH3OH with the highest barrier of 1.04eV (HCHO+H→CH2OH). Additionally, CH4 will be produced as a main byproduct according to the low energy barrier pathway of CH3OCH3 →CH3OCH2 →CH2 →CH3 →CH4. The highest reaction barrier in this path is 0.85eV associated with CH3 hydrogenation to CH4. Besides that, the likely route for CH4 formation from CO is CO→CHO→CH→CH2 →CH3 →CH4. The highest reaction barrier in this route is 0.93eV with CO hydrogenation to CHO. This barrier is 0.32 and 0.08eV higher than the barriers of CH3OCH2 →CH3O+CH2 and CH3 +H→CH4, respectively. Therefore, CH4 formation from CO is less preferred than that from DME. HOAc formation is favored via CH2CO oxidation with O species followed by hydrogenation, as discussed above. By combining an optimal route for CH2CO formation, the most likely HOAc formation pathway is considered to be CH3OCH3 →CH3OCH2 →CH2 →CH2CO→CH2COO→CH2COOH→CH3COOH. The RDS is CH2COOH hydrogenation to CH3COOH with a reaction barrier of 1.28eV. This is 0.20eV lower than the RDS barrier of P1, and indicates kinetic competition of HOAc formation with respect to CH3CH2OH synthesis. Fig. 7 presents a summary of the potential energy surfaces of the most likely reaction pathways for CH3CH2OH, CH3OH, HOAc, and CH4 synthesis from CO and DME. The overall CH3CH2OH synthesis starting from DME decomposition is exothermic by −0.67eV, but that starting from CO hydrogenation is endothermic by 0.35eV. Therefore, ethanol formation from DME is thermodynamically preferred and benefitted. CH3OH synthesis is thermodynamically unfavorable because of the increasing reaction energies, whereas HOAc and CH4 synthesis commencing from DME is favored thermodynamically with overall exothermic reactions. 5 Conclusions Reaction mechanisms of efficient CH3CH2OH synthesis from DME and syngas were studied systematically via DFT calculations. Possible elementary reactions that involve DME decomposition, CO insertion, subsequent hydrogenation and oxidation, and competing reactions of direct CO hydrogenation on an active Co stepped surface were calculated. Preferred adsorption geometries, parameters, and adsorption energies of key reaction intermediates were obtained. The adsorption energies of saturated species CH3OCH3, CH3OH, and CH3CH2OH are lower than those of CH3CHO and HCHO, and are much lower than the unsaturated species. With the increase of the valence saturation of C atom, the adsorption configuration changes from C binding to CO binding, and finally to O binding. The most favorable pathway for CH3CH2OH synthesis from DME and syngas is CH3OCH3 →CH3OCH2 →CH2 →CH2CO→CH3CO→CH3CHO→CH3CHOH→CH3CH2OH. CH3CHO hydrogenation to CH3CHOH becomes the rate-determining step with an activation energy of 1.48eV. The barriers for other steps in this pathway are less than 0.7eV. CO insertion into CH2 to form ketene CH2CO is more facile than the insertions into CH and CH3. The corresponding barriers are 0.48, 0.64, and 1.11eV, respectively. Hydrogenation at the carbon atom occurs prior to that at the oxygen atom with an order of α–carbon>carbonyl carbon>oxygen. The calculations demonstrate that CH3CH2OH synthesis via DME carbonylation and hydrogenation is thermodynamically favored and is kinetically faster than that via syngas direct synthesis. CH4 and HOAc are identified as two predominant competing byproducts.
