DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(09)60061-9 Effect of Additives on Catalytic Cracking of Biomass Gasification Tar over a Nickel-Based Catalyst LIU Haibo 1 , CHEN Tianhu 1,* , ZHANG Xianlong 2 , LI Jinhu 1 , CHANG Dongyin 1 , SONG Lei 1 1 School of Resource and Environmental Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei 230009, Anhui, China 2 School of Chemical Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei 230009, Anhui, China Abstract: The palygorskite-supported nickel (Ni/PG) catalysts were modified by loading with several additives (Fe, Mg, Mn, and Ce) by incipient wetness impregnation. The effect of the additives and their content on the catalytic activity of Ni/PG and H 2 yield in tar cracking was investigated. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The content of the additives affected the catalyst activity and the selectivity in tar cracking. Fe was the best species for promoting the performance of Ni/PG both in tar conversion and H 2 yield. Increasing the Fe loading amount over the Ni/PG catalyst was favorable for tar removal. Key words: biomass gasification; tar; supported catalyst; palygorskite; nickel; additive; carbon deposition; tar removal Technologies for utilizing renewable energy have attracted the attention of many governments and corporations due to the shortage of world energy and greenhouse effects caused by the emission of CO 2 . Biomass energy is a topic of research because of its widespread sources and renewability. Among the biomass conversion processes, biomass gasification and power genera- tion are the most promising. However, a major issue in biomass gasification is how to deal with the tar formed in the product gas, which would cause problems to the process equipment and the engines and turbines used in the application of the produced gas when it condenses. Thus, the removal of tar components (condensable hydrocarbons, which includes benzene, phenol, naphthalene, other oxygen-containing hydrocarbons, and complex PAH) from the product gas before it condenses is necessary [1]. It has been suggested that the catalytic cracking of gaseous tar species is the most promising technology by the adoption of active catalysts [2,3]. For the catalytic cracking of benzene, phenol, naphthalene, and other tar model compounds, there are two main series of catalysts: noble metal-based catalysts (Rh, Ru, Pd, etc.) [4–6] and transition metal-based (Ni, Co, Cu, etc.) catalysts [7–10]. The Ni-based catalysts are the only one close to the noble metal-based catalysts in activity, but it is much cheaper. Thus, Ni-based catalysts are regarded as the best potential option for a tar catalyst although it often suffered from deactivation and sintering at high temperatures. Therefore, it is crucial to explore a new catalyst to avoid catalyst sintering and reduce the use of noble metals. Recently, a catalyst modified by a small amount of a metal additive has caught the attention of researchers [11–13]. Addi- tives added into Ni-based catalysts can improve the stability, selectivity, dispersion of active components, and coking resis- tance. Wang et al. [14] investigated the promotional effects of Ce, La, and Ca on the catalytic performance of Ni/α-Al 2 O 3 and Ni/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The results indicated that Ce was the best promoter among the three promoters tested and the effect of Ce loadings on the catalytic performance was investigated. Yang et al. [15] studied the promotional effect of Ce on the catalytic performance of 8%Ni/γ-Al 2 O 3 . It was found that the addition of Ce decreased the activation energy of CH 4 and improved the resistance to carbon deposition of the catalyst. In addition, the effect of Ce loading on Ni/CeO 2 -Al 2 O 3 catalytic carbon dioxide reforming of methane was investigated by Wang et al. [16]. The results showed that a large amount of promoter generally decreased catalytic activity because of the coverage of active sites. The total oxidation of C 3 H 6 was investigated over Au/Al 2 O 3 and the effect of additives (Ce, Mn, Co, and Fe) on LIU Haibo et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 409–414 Au/Al 2 O 3 was investigated by Gluhoi et al. [11]. The results indicated that the most active catalyst contained Ce, which was attributed to the lattice oxygen of the oxide. Yu et al. [17] in- vestigated the effect of Ni-Fe/attapulgite on the steam re- forming of apricot stone pyrolysis tar for hydrogen-rich gas. The results showed that the Ni-Fe/attapulgite catalyst had excellent low-temperature activity and coking resistance. The effect of MgO on Pt/Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalytic reforming of biomass pyrolysis tar was investigated by Nakamura et al. [6]. The results showed that MgO played a crucial role in de- creasing the reduction temperature of NiO, improving the dispersion of Ni and sintering resistance and enhancing the stability and catalytic activity of Pt/Ni/CeO 2 /MgO/Al 2 O 3 . Various additives and their loading have a significant impact on the resistance to sintering and carbon deposition, improving the stability and dispersion of the active component and cata- lytic activity of the catalyst. Palygorskite-supported Ni (Ni/PG) catalysts developed in our previous work have showed out- standing potential in the catalytic cracking of biomass tar but suffered from the above problems to some degree [18]. In this work, efforts were made on the modification of the Ni/PG catalyst by the loading of several additives (Fe, Mg, Mn, and Ce) to evaluate the influence of the additives on a 6%Ni/PG catalyst for the cracking rice husk gasification tar. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation Palygorskite (PG) clay used was sampled from Crown Hill, Mingguang city, Anhui province, China. Its particle size was less than 0.074 mm after extrusion, cutting, and crushing. The contents of SiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , MgO, Fe 2 O 3 , and FeO in PG clay were 65.52%, 5.36%, 13.93%, 3.19%, and 0.42%, respectively. The specific surface area, pore volume, and maximum pore di- ameter were 228.5 m 2 /g, 0.41 ml/g, and 2.8 nm, respectively. PG was impregnated with metal salts by pore volume wetness impregnation. Ni(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O (29.7 g), Fe(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O (43.3 g), and 86 ml deionized distilled water were put in a 150 ml beaker. The mixed liquor was poured into 88 g PG clay after they were dissolved. The beaker was washed twice with 10 ml deionized distilled water. Then the compound was stirred for 20 min. After stirring, the impregnated samples were aged at room temperature overnight, dried at 378 K, cooled to room temperature, and ground and sieved to obtain particles of 20–40 mesh. The catalysts were finally calcined in an air flow at 773 K for 2 h and in a H 2 flow at 773 K for 1 h. After that, a 6%Fe-6%Ni/PG catalyst was obtained. The catalysts with different Fe loadings and including Mg, Mn, and Ce additives were also prepared using the same method. 1.2 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the catalysts was performed on a Rigaku D/Max-rB diffractometer using Cu K α radiation at 40 kV tube voltage and 100 mA tube current. The XRD patterns were taken in the range of 2θ = 5°–70° at a scan speed of 4°/min in an apparatus. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on an H-800 apparatus. 1.3 Catalyst activity Biomass tar derived from a rice husk gasification power plant was used as the raw material. The tar consisted of 79.2% C, 5.3% H, 1.6% N, 7.4% O, 5.3% ash, and a small amount of Cl and S. The fixed experimental conditions were temperature 973 K, reaction time 20 min, catalyst 10 g, tar concentration 0.45 g/min, and carrier gas (N 2 ) flow rate 80 ml/min. The rice husk gasification tar was pumped into the reactor with a peri- staltic pump and the time was recorded from the first drop. The catalyst activity for catalytic cracking was evaluated by tar conversion, H 2 yield, and carbon deposition. The reference [19] is generally regarded as the standard for tar collecting and analysis, but in this work, granular activated carbon (GAC) was used for collecting unreacted tar and byproducts. The definition of tar conversion was X(tar) = (m(tar1) − m(tar2))/m(tar1) × 100%, where m(tar1) and m(tar2) repre- sented the amount of tar pumped into the reactor and tar col- lected in the filter, respectively. The noncondensible gases including hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane were collected by a gas col- lection bag, measured by a wet test meter, and analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-7890T) equipped with a C2000 col- umn and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using argon as the carrier gas. The H 2 yield was calculated by X(H 2 ) = m(H2)/ m(H1) × 100%, where m(H2) and m(H1) represented the mass of hydrogen contained in the catalytic cracking gas and hy- drogen from reacted tar, respectively. The amount of total carbon deposited on the catalyst was analyzed on a Multi N/C 2100 analyzer. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Effect of additives and additive loading on 6%Ni/PG catalyst activity The effects of Fe, Mg, Mn, and Ce on 6%Ni/PG catalyst catalytic cracking of biomass gasification tar are shown in Fig. 1. Only 64% tar conversion was observed over 6%Ni/PG. The addition of additives played a different role in tar conversion. Among the additives, the addition of Mg, Mn, and Ce im- proved the catalyst activity in catalytic cracking of tar with low additive loading. However, the promotion became weak with increasing additive loading. Especially, the addition of Ce even decreased the catalyst activity in the catalytic decomposition of tar when the Ce loading was more than 6%. These results indicated that the promotion by Mg, Mn, and Ce on the LIU Haibo et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 409–414 6%Ni/PG catalyst was limited. However, Fe played an impor- tant role in improving 6%Ni/PG catalyst activity, which was far superior to those of the other additives, and the promotion increased with increasing Fe loading (the tar conversion reached 98.2% over the 8%Fe-6%Ni/PG catalyst). Table 2 shows the effects of the additives and their loading on the composition and content of the catalytic cracking tar product gases (H 2 , CO, and CH 4 ). It can be seen from Table 2 that the H 2 yield was the highest and the total gas produced increased by 114.7–351.5 ml/g due to the addition of additives compared with 128.3 ml/g over the 6%Ni/PG catalyst. Moreover, Fig. 1 shows that the H 2 yield increased by 5.8%–41.8% due to the addition of additives compared with 16.7% over 6%Ni/PG. These results indicated that the addition of the additives gave better catalyst activity for the catalytic cracking of biomass tar, which was favorable for the catalytic cracking of macromo- lecular organic compounds into permanent small molecule gases and improved the quality of the biomass gasification gas. Among these additives, Fe proved to be the best additive in promoting tar conversion, and the role of Mg was only no better than Fe. The effect of additive loading on the catalytic cracking of biomass tar is shown in Table 2. The 64.4% tar conversion over 6%Ni/PG increased to 98% with increasing Fe loading. However, the tar conversion was less to different degrees with the increase of Mg, Mn, and Ce loadings, which were still higher than 6%Ni/PG. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that the cata- lyst modified by Fe had the best activity for hydrogen produc- tion. In addition, when the additive loading was 3%, the cata- lyst modified by Mg showed the highest hydrogen yield. The effect of the additives on the catalysts was in the order Fe > Mg > Mn > Ce. The influence of the additives and additive loading on the catalytic cracking of biomass tar can be con- cluded from these results. This is in good agreement with the results of Wang et al. [16]. 2.2 XRD results Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of the 6%Ni/PG, 8%Fe-6%Ni/PG, 8%Mg-6%Ni/PG, 8%Mn-%6Ni/PG, and 8%Ce-6%Ni/PG catalysts. It can be seen that the characteristic diffraction peaks assigned to the spinel of Ni-Fe (Ni 0.6 Fe 2.4 O 4 ) [20] and alloy of Ni-Fe were observed in the 8%Fe-6%Ni/PG catalyst. The characteristic diffraction peaks attributed to Mg 0.4 Ni 0.6 O, (NiO) 0.5 (MnO) 0.5 , and CeO 2 can be observed over 8%Mg-6%Ni/PG, 8%Mn-6%Ni/PG, and 8%Ce-6%Ni/PG. In addition, the diffraction peaks assigned to PG decreased with the addition of additives, which was due to the thermal evolu- tion of PG between 673 and 873 K, but the club-shaped 60 70 80 90 100 Fe-6%Ni/PG Mg-6%Ni/PG Mn-6%Ni/PG Ce-6%Ni/PG Fe-6%Ni/PG Mg-6%Ni/PG Mn-6%Ni/PG Ce-6%Ni/PG (a) 012345678 20 30 40 50 60 70 Additive content X ( tar)/ % Y (H 2 )/ % (b) Fig. 1.

LIU Haibo et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 409–414 structure was maintained as shown in Fig. 3. Its water of crystallization and structural water were extruded at over 673 K, which resulted in the folding and contraction of the PG structure and the collapsing of PG pore structure, but it did not destroy the layer structure of PG [21]. In addition, the charac- teristic peaks of Ni and NiO were not found over the 6%Ni/PG catalyst, which was attributed to the high dispersion or poor crystallinity of the low loading Ni or NiO. However, the characteristic peaks of the Ni phase can be seen after the addi- tion of additives. Therefore, it can be speculated that these feature peaks were formed from the interaction between Ni or NiO and the additive or between the PG and alloy metal during the preparation of the catalysts. The addition of additives improved the activity of 6%Ni/PG catalyst for the catalytic cracking of biomass tar. An interaction between the additive and Ni or NiO can be found from the XRD patterns, which was formed during the calcination of the modified catalyst. The interaction changed the adsorption and catalytic cracking capability. Thus, the catalyst modified by different additives showed excellent activity in the catalytic cracking of biomass tar. A previous work [22] had proved that an interaction during the active components or between the active component and support resulted in an increase in cata- lyst activity. In addition, the effect of additives and additive loading on 6%Ni/PG catalyst was investigated. The results showed that Fe had the best role in improving 6%Ni/PG catalyst activity in the catalytic cracking of biomass tar. The increase of the effect on catalytic cracking of biomass tar becomes less with increasing Fe loading. The XRD patterns of the 6%Ni/PG catalysts modified by different Fe loadings are presented in Fig. 4. It can be seen from that Ni 0.6 Fe 2.4 O 4 was highly dispersed on the surface of PG at low Fe loading (3%). The Ni 0.6 Fe 2.4 O 4 char- acteristic peaks became sharp with the increase in Fe loading, which indicated the gradual formation of a crystalline phase, increase in particle size, and decrease in modified catalyst surface that limited the increase in catalyst activity. The cata- lyst activity was also different when the active components were the same, which is mainly because the crystalline struc- ture of the catalyst was changed when the proportion of the components was changed [23]. Therefore, additive loading also 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 PG Quartz Ni 0.6 Fe 2.4 O 4 Mg 0.4 Ni 0.6 O CeO 2 (NiO) 0.5 (MnO) 0.5 Fe-Ni alloy 2θ/( o ) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) In te n s ity Fig. 2.

LIU Haibo et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 409–414 affected the activity of the 6%Ni/PG catalyst. That is to say, the catalyst showed a best catalytic activity only when the additive loading was within a limited range [10]. 2.3 TEM results TEM pictures of the 6%Ni/PG catalyst and 6%Ni/PG cata- lysts modified by different additives are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen from Fig. 3(a) that the shape of PG was clear and the Ni particles on PG were undistinguished because they were small. This showed that the Ni particles were highly dispersed on the surface before the addition of additives. This is in good agreement with the XRD patterns of 6%Ni/PG. However, dif- ferent particle sizes were found in the TEM images of the 6%Ni/PG catalyst modified by additives. This was attributed to an interaction of different degrees between the two metals, which was confirmed by their XRD patterns. The interaction changed the dispersion of particles on the support; however, there was an increase in the activity of the 6%Ni/PG catalyst after the addition of additives. That is, the effect of the inter- action on increasing the catalyst activity for the catalytic cracking of biomass tar was much larger than the decrease of catalyst activity due to larger particle size and lower dispersion. In addition, the emergence and aggregation of particles on the support and increase of particle size can be found in Fig. 3 (b) and (c) with the increase in Fe loading. The metal particles can be obviously seen on PG as the additive loading increased to 8%. This is consistent with the XRD patterns. It can be speculated that the increase in particle size and the blocking of some pore structure resulted in the decrease of the catalyst surface area. Consequently, the increase in catalytic activity did not occur along with the increase of additive content, and there was even decreased catalytic activity owing to the increase of additive loading. This is in good agreement with the experi- mental results. 2.4 Total carbon analysis It can be found from Table 2 that carbon deposition on the reacted catalysts was increased along with tar conversion on 6%Ni/PG modified by Fe. When the amounts of carbon de- posited were 21.7% and 39.1%, the corresponding tar conver- sions were 64.4% and 99.9%, respectively. That is, carbon deposition increased with the increase of tar conversion, which was attributed to the addition of the additive. The additive enhanced the catalytic activity of the 6%Ni/PG catalyst and decreased the stability of the macromolecular organic com- pounds in biomass tar. Therefore, the tar was converted into coke and permanent gases under the action of the modified 6%Ni/PG catalyst, which increased tar conversion, reduced the tar content in the biomass gases, and improved the quality of the biomass gases. The trend was not found on the 6%Ni/PG catalysts modified by Mg, Mn, and Ce. The reason can be that the interaction on the 6%Ni/PG catalysts modified by Mg and Mn was weaker and there was no interaction on the 6%Ni/PG catalyst modified by Ce. Therefore, the effect of different additives on the catalytic activity of 6%Ni/PG catalysts was remarkably different. 3 Conclusions The effect of additives (Fe, Mg, Mn, and Ce) on a 6%Ni/PG catalyst was different. Among the additives, the effect of Fe on the 6%Ni/PG catalyst was strong compared with that of Mg, Mn, and Ce. Tar conversion and H 2 yield were 98.2% and 56.2%, respectively, when the Fe loading was increased to 8%. Fe-Ni alloy and Fe-Ni spinel were found on the 6%Ni/PG catalyst modified by Fe, which enhanced the catalyst activity for breaking C–C and C–H bonds, increased carbon deposition and H 2 yield, and showed the synergistic effect of the active components of Fe and Ni. The quantitative relationship between carbon deposition and tar conversion and the mechanism of the catalytic cracking of tar will be investigated with tar model compounds (benzene, toluene, and naphthalene) in a following study.

Tel: +86-551-2903990 The palygorskite-supported nickel (Ni/PG) catalysts were modified by loading with several additives (Fe, Mg, Mn, and Ce) by incipient wetness impregnation. The effect of the additives and their content on the catalytic activity of Ni/PG and H2 yield in tar cracking was investigated. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The content of the additives affected the catalyst activity and the selectivity in tar cracking. Fe was the best species for promoting the performance of Ni/PG both in tar conversion and H2 yield. Increasing the Fe loading amount over the Ni/PG catalyst was favorable for tar removal. 摘要 ：采用等体积浸渍法制备了不同助剂 (Fe, Mg, Mn 和 Ce) 修饰的镍-凹凸棒石粘土基催化剂 (Ni/PG), 并用于催化裂解生物质气化焦油反应. 采用 X 射线衍射和透射电子显微镜对 Ni/PG 催化剂进行了表征, 并用总碳分析仪测定了催化剂上的积炭. 结果表明, 助剂的种类及其含量对催化剂性能的影响显著, 在所选用的助剂中, Fe 助剂入最有利于提高 Ni/PG 催化剂上焦油的去除率和 H2 的收率, 且随助剂 Fe 含量的增加, 催化剂活性逐渐提高. Graphical abstract The Ni-based catalyst with the Fe additive showed high tar removal because of interaction of nickel oxides and iron oxides on palygorskite (PG). The tar removal of 99.0% was obtained over 8%Fe-6%Ni/PG, which was 34.6% and 30% higher than 6%Ni/PG and 8%Mn-6%Ni/PG, respectively.
