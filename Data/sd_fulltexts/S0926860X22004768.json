Phenomena of relevance to current industrial processes, processes under industrial development or of interest for future commercial applications are particularly welcome. Heterogeneous, homogeneous and biocatalysis are included. Research investigating catalytic actions of heterogeneous, homogeneous, biological and natural systems are especially encouraged. â€¢ Scientifi c aspects of preparation, activation, aging, deactivation, rejuvenation, regeneration and start up transient effects of commercially interesting or representative model catalysts. â€¢ Scientifi c methods of characterization of catalysts, especially if they are applicable to industrial catalysts. â€¢ Chemical engineering aspects relevant to an improved understanding of catalytic phenomena or application to catalysis. Results involving a joint approach by chemical engineering and catalytic science are particularly welcome. â€¢ New catalysts, catalytic reactions, catalytic routes and processes of potential practical interest. â€¢ Catalysis and catalytic processes for sustainable practices, including sustainable energy supply and consumption processes, and sustainable chemicals production. The journal accepts original Research Papers, Reviews, invited Perspective articles and Letters to the Editor. Applied Catalysis B: Environmental will publish papers covering all aspects of environmental catalysis. For information on submission of manuscripts see inside back cover page. Author information Submissions Submission to this journal proceeds totally on-line via the journalâ€™s homepage at http://www. elsevier.com/locate/apcata. Manuscripts are assigned to the journal editors on a random basis. Please note that all Review articles are handled by the editorial team as a whole. NB: The editors can forward manuscripts to any of the other handling editors if they deem appropriate. For detailed instruction on the preparation of electronic artwork, consult http://www.elsevier. com/artworkinstructions Other enquiries Contact details for questions arising after acceptance of an article, especially those relating to proofs, will be provided by the publisher. You can track accepted articles at http://www. elsevier.com/trackarticle. You can also check our Author FAQs at http://www.elsevier.com/ authorFAQ and/or contact Customer Support via http://service.elsevier.com. Proofs When your manuscript is received by the Publisher it is considered to be in its fi nal form. Proofs are not to be regarded as â€œdraftsâ€™â€™. One set of page proofs in PDF format will be sent by e-mail to the corresponding Author, to be checked for typesetting/editing. No changes in, or additions to, the accepted (and subsequently edited) manuscript will be allowed at this stage. Proofreading is solely the authors responsibility. A form with queries from the copyeditor may accompany your proofs. Please answer all queries and make any corrections or additions required. Any amendments will be incorporated and the fi nal article will then be published online as an Article in Press on ScienceDirect www.sciencedirect.com Articles in Press will be removed once the paper has been assigned to an issue and the issue has been compiled.
