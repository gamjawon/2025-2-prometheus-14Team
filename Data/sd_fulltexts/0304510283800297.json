Foreword This issue of the Journal of Molecular Catalysis is devoted to the Sym- posium on Advanced Methods of Catalyst Characterization held in Boston, MA, in November 1982. The symposium program is listed on pages ii - iv. The incentive for organizing the symposium came both from the U.S. Mate- rials Research Society, which wishes to express its continuing commitment to the materials science of heterogeneous catalysts, and from industry as documented by the co-sponsorship and grants by the chemical and petro- leum companies listed on p. i. The financial support of the Office of Naval Research and the Petroleum Research Fund of the American Chemical So- ciety is also gratefully acknowledged. The aim of the symposium was to discuss, present and publish state-of- the-art experimental findings on the distribution of phases and elements, local structures, agglomeration of two or more elements in small clusters in real and model highly dispersed heterogeneous catalysts. Electron micro- scopic studies down to atomic level of resolution were reported, diffraction and analysis of small catalyst particles in the electron microscope were pre- sented, and these results demonstrated convincingly that advanced electron microscopy is one of the most powerful tools for unraveling the structure of heterogeneous catalysts. Several papers dealt with the use of spectroscopic methods such as EELS (electron energy loss spectroscopy), SIMS (secondary ion mass spec- trometry), ISS (ion scattering spectroscopy), EXAFS (extended X-ray ab- sorption fine structure spectroscopy), Mossbauer, infrared and solid state NMR (both spin-echo and magic angle spinning) spectroscopies. It is appar- ent that a combination of these modem spectroscopic tools with electron microscopy has the potential of providing an unprecedented insight into the relationship between the structure and function of heterogeneous catalysts. Further advances are needed in still higher spectroscopic sensitivity so that, for example, solid state NMR could be used more routinely for the charac- terization of adsorbed layers, in still finer analytical resolution in the elec- tron microscope, and in still more powerful resolution for the imaging of the lighter elements. Such advances are forthcoming through a continued devel- opment of instrumentation, and it can be anticipated that the type of char- acterization presented in the symposium will have an increased impact on the art of catalyst preparation with the result that heterogeneous catalysts VI of greater uniformity, dispersion, defined local structure and stability may be made in the future. Such a goal will no doubt be achieved by a step-wise process and improvements at no low cost in capital investment for instru- mentation, but the industrial importance of catalysis appears to justify the effort and expenditures committed toward materials science of catalysts.
