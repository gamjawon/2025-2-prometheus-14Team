Tel.: +33-5-49-45-39-97; fax: +33-5-49-45-34-99 Considering both the influence of the nature of the metal (Rh, Pt, Ni, Cu, Zn, Fe) and the role of the support (γ-Al2O3, 12%CeO2–Al2O3,CeO2,Ce0.63Zr0.37O2), CO2 is presented as a primary product in the bio-ethanol steam-reforming catalytic reaction (SRR) over some supported metal catalysts. Based on this unexpected observation, a new strategy for maximizing the hydrogen production and minimizing the CO formation is proposed. Any highly selective catalytic formulation should be free of any promoter in the water gas shift reaction (WGSR) which tends to equilibrate the SRR gas towards higher CO concentrations. 1 Introduction Since a few decades, increasing attention is being paid to pollution-related environmental and public health problems. Particularly, as one of the major contributor to the atmospheric pollution, the automotive sector had to work hard on pollution control. Both catalytic converters on gasoline-fueled engines and filters for particulates on diesel-fueled engines were implemented. The next step, to overpass the forthcoming regulations on CO2 emissions according to the Kyoto's Protocol (in Europe, 8% reduction compared to the 1990s emissions by 2008–2012), requires the development of both new engines and alternative fuels… Fuel cells recently appeared as one solution in the development of zero-emission electrical vehicle. Technical options range from batteries to liquid H2 tanks, high pressure H2 storage, medium pressure H2 storage on hydrides and nano-structured carbons and on-board H2 production [1–4]. This study is in keeping with this last approach. Bio-ethanol, presented as an environmentally friendly fuel (renewable, CO2 neutral, non toxic…), was used as a fuel and the catalytic steam reforming reaction (SRR) was studied for H2 on-board production (1). (1) C 2 H 5 OH+3H 2 O→6H 2+2CO 2 (ΔH 0 r =173.1 kJmol −1) The goal was a high yield in H2 and a high selectivity towards CO2. In fact, CO, possibly produced in the SRR, is commonly described as a poison of the fuel cell electrodes made of noble metals. A wide range of catalysts were tested using different metals (Rh, Pt, Pd, Ru, Ni, Cu, Zn, Fe) and various supports (Al2O3, 12%CeO2–Al2O3,CeO2,CeO2–ZrO2,ZrO2). The reason for such a screening was to obtain a catalyst both (i) highly active in the SRR to maximize the ethanol conversion to hydrogen, that is a high yield in H2 and (ii) highly selective towards the formation of CO2 (low CO outlet concentration) both in the SRR(1) and in the water gas shift reaction (WGSR): (2) CO+H 2 O→CO 2+H 2 2 Experimental A 12%CeO2–Al2O3 was prepared by impregnation of a γ-Al2O3 support commercialized by Procatalyse (130 m 2 g −1 ) with an aqueous solution of Ce(NO3)6(NH4)2, dried overnight at 120 °C and calcined at 500 °C under flowing dry air (30 cm 3 min −1 ) for 5 h. The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the different supports using aqueous solutions of the corresponding metal precursor salts (Rh(NO3)3,Pt(NH3)2(NO2)2,Pd(NO3)2,Ni(NO3)2,Cu(NO3)2,Zn(NO3)2,FeCl3). The as-prepared catalysts were pre-calcined at 700 °C under flowing dry air (30 cm 3 min −1 ) for 5 h. Reactivity testing was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a quartz fixed-bed reactor (down flow). 40 mg catalyst (grain size: 250–315 μm) diluted in 360 mg cordierite (grain size: 100–200 μm) were used for each test. Before testing, the catalyst was reduced under flowing hydrogen (50 cm 3 min −1 ) at 300 °C for 1 h. A stoichiometric reaction mixture was used (12.8 vol%C2H5OH + 38.4 vol% H2O + 48.8 vol%N2 − water:ethanol=3:1 mol/mol). Total flow rate was 100 cm 3 min −1 . Ethanol and water were introduced as liquids using automated syringes, vaporized at 120 °C and further eluted by N2 (48 cm 3 min −1 ). Each test was performed at constant temperature, between 500 and 800 °C. Before the gas phase chromatographs, condensable vapors (ethanol, water, acetaldehyde, acetone…) were trapped using a condenser which temperature was set at 0.5 °C. The liquid volume was used to approximate the ethanol conversion. Gas analysis was performed on-line using a combination of three gas chromatographs: two of them equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and the other one equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). H2 was analyzed using a TCD, equipped with a 5A molecular sieve column, with N2 as both the carrier gas and the reference gas. N2, CO, CO2 and CH4 were analyzed using a TCD, equipped with a CTR column (Alltech), with H2 as both the carrier gas and the reference gas. N2 was not only a dilutant but also a tracer and the corresponding GC signal was used to estimate the outlet flow rate to determine the hydrogen yield. Finally, hydrocarbons (CH4,C2H6 and C2H4 essentially) were separated on a Porapak Q column and analyzed with the FID detector. 3 Results and discussion A wide range of catalysts was tested, changing both the active phase (Rh, Pt, Pd, Ru, Ni, Cu, Zn, Fe) and the oxide support (Al2O3, 12%CeO2–Al2O3,CeO2,CeO2–ZrO2,ZrO2). As the SRR was thought to produce CO as a primary product, the overall idea was to couple both a highly active SR catalyst and a highly active catalyst in the WGSR (2) for the subsequent transformation of CO – produced upon bio-ethanol SR – to CO2. On purpose, metals were selected either for their activity in the SRR (Rh, Ni) [5] or/and for their activity in the WGSR (Pt, Cu, Zn, Fe) [6]. Additionally, supports were tested either as promoters of the WGSR (ceria-based supports) [7] or/and the SRR (2) [8]. In fact, in the alkylated aromatics selective reforming reaction, Duprez et al. [9] proposed a bi-functional mechanism where the hydrocarbon to be reformed would be activated on the metal particle and the water would be activated on the support as hydroxyl groups. In such a scheme, oxide supports with high OH groups surface mobility should be considered as promoters in the SRR. In that sense, a Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 mixed oxide – with enhanced oxygen surface mobility [10] – was tested as support. In a first part, the influence of the metal particle chemical nature was checked. Catalytic performances in the bio-ethanol SRR of γ-Al2O3 (Procatalyse, S BET =130 m 2 g −1 ) supported metal catalysts (Rh, Pt, Pd, Ru, Ni, Cu, Zn, Fe) were studied. The results are presented in Table 1 . At 700 °C under atmospheric pressure, γ-Al2O3 supported Rh and Ni catalysts clearly appeared as the most active and selective catalysts in the ethanol SRR. Compared to Rh/γ-Al2O3, Ni/γ-Al2O3 gave a higher yield in hydrogen but a lower selectivity towards CO2. In fact, earlier studies had demonstrated that Rh and Ni are the best catalysts in the hydrocarbons SRR. Additionally, Ni and especially Rh were poor candidates in the WGSR [11,12]. Lower activities and lower selectivities towards CO2 are observed using γ-Al2O3 supported Pt, Cu, Zn or Fe catalysts. Such metals are known as efficient catalysts in the WGSR while they have only limited activity in the SRR. As a result, such catalytic formulations lead to an equilibrated CO/CO2 mixture, according to the thermodynamic. Additionally, Ru catalyst was almost inactive in the SRR but essentially active in the ethanol dehydration reaction leading to the formation of ethylene (38%). Such a catalyst deactivate rapidly due to coke formation by ethylene polymerization. Dehydration is also observed on Cu, Pt, Zn and Fe. Furthermore, one can note that Pd, Cu and Zn catalysts were very poorly selective towards CO2 and active in the hydrogenolysis reaction towards methane formation. Consequently, (i) metals highly active in the SRR and poorly efficient in the WGSR would give active and selective catalysts in the ethanol SRR and (ii) active metals in the WGSR would result in poorly selective catalysts towards the formation of CO2 upon bio-ethanol steam reforming. In the second part, concentrating on Rh and Ni catalysts, the role of the oxide support (γ-Al2O3, 12%CeO2–Al2O3,CeO2,Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 and ZrO2) was investigated. To improve the performances of the catalyst in the SRR, ceria-containing supports (12%CeO2–Al2O3,CeO2,CeO2–ZrO2), with enhanced OH surface mobility [10,13,14], were used as supports. Furthermore, ceria is known as a promoter in the WGSR [7]. The results obtained upon reaction at 600 °C under atmospheric pressure are presented in Table 2 for Rh-based catalysts and Table 3 for Ni-based catalysts. Looking at Rh catalysts (Table 2), 1%Rh/γ-Al2O3 showed the highest selectivity while 1%Rh/CeO2–ZrO2 exhibited the highest yield in hydrogen. 1%Rh/ZrO2 activity could not be properly measured due to rapid deactivation. In fact, H2 production is initially low and large amounts of ethylene are detected. In descending order, the following sequences could be establish for both the activity: 1%Rh/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2>1%Rh/12%CeO2–γ-Al2O3>1%Rh/CeO2>1%Rh/γ-Al2O3 and the selectivity towards CO2:1%Rh/γ-Al2O3>1%Rh/12%CeO2–γ-Al2O3>1%Rh/CeO2>1%Rh/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2. So that: (i) in agreement with Duprez's bifunctional mechanism, the activity of the catalyst in the SRR increases as the OH groups mobility at the catalyst surface increases and (ii) the selectivity of the catalyst towards CO2 decreases as the efficiency of the catalyst in the WGSR increases. The last observation tends to indicate that CO2 is produced as a primary product in the ethanol SRR and transformed into CO via the WGSR to reach the thermodynamic equilibrium. In fact, looking at the results obtained on ceria-containing catalysts, one can observe that the thermodynamic equilibrium is almost reached. The different product fractions are comparable to the thermodynamic equilibrium concentrations obtained from the calculations performed using an homemade program. Almost the same conclusions can be drawn from the results obtained with Ni catalysts (Table 3). The activity in the SRR directly varies as the degree of mobility of surface OH groups (9.7%Ni/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2>9.7%Ni/CeO2>9.7%Ni/12%CeO2–γ-Al2O3>9.7%Ni/γ-Al2O3) and the selectivity towards CO2 is controlled by the activity in the WGSR (9.7%Ni/γ-Al2O3>9.7%Ni/12%CeO2–γ-Al2O3>9.7%Ni/CeO2>9.7%Ni/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2). Use of ceria-based supports, highly active in the WGSR, immediately lead to the thermodynamic CO/CO2 equilibrium. As a result, activity in the SRR and selectivity towards CO2 vary in the opposite direction. In conclusion, these unexpected and unprecedented results clearly evidence the formation of CO2 as a primary product in the ethanol SRR on some metal supported catalysts. This is a totally different picture compared to the results obtained from earlier studies on hydrocarbons steam reforming. Such results extensively showed that CO was produced as a primary product. For that reason, high temperature WGS and low temperature WGS units are required on methane steam reforming industrial plants for the synthesis of ammonia. Nevertheless, recent results on dimethyl ether catalytic SR also suggested CO2 and H2 as primary products [15]. As a result, the most selective catalyst towards CO2 in the bio-ethanol SRR should contain no WGSR promoters. References [1] Y. Jamal M.L. Wyszinski Int. J.

Based on this unexpected observation, a new strategy for maximizing the hydrogen production and minimizing the CO formation is proposed. Any highly selective catalytic formulation should be free of any promoter in the water gas shift reaction (WGSR) which tends to equilibrate the SRR gas towards higher CO concentrations.",
