Graphical abstract A novel Ni-Ce-Ti mixed oxide catalyst prepared by the hydrothermal method has been developed for the selective catalytic reduction of NOx by NH3. It was found that Ni-Ce-Ti catalyst showed high NH3-SCR activity, excellent N2 selectivity with broad operation temperature window. Based on the catalyst characterization, the redox cycle (Ni3+ +Ce3+ ↔Ni2+ +Ce4+), the amorphous structure and more surface defects over Ni-Ce-Ti catalyst are responsible for the high catalytic deNOx performance. In situ DRIFT experiments demonstrated that the synergetic effect between Ni and Ce contributes to the formation of reactive NH3 on Lewis acid sites and monodentate nitrate, thus facilitating the NH3-SCR reaction to proceed. The present Ni-Ce-Ti catalyst has great potential for the practical removal of NOx. Keywords Nitrogen oxides NH3-SCR Ni-Ce-Ti catalyst In-situ DRIFTS 1 Introduction More and more emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from diesel engine exhaust and the industrial combustion of fossil fuels caused a variety of serious environmental issues, such as acid rain and photochemical smog [1]. As a result, different methods have been developed for the control of NOx [2]. Among them selective catalytic reduction of NOx by NH3 (NH3-SCR) is a typical efficient technology to reduce NOx [2,3]. The commercial V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst has been widely used for the NH3-SCR of NOx. However, the drawbacks of this commercial catalyst, such as the narrow temperature window and the formation of N2O at high temperatures, have restrained its industrial application [4,5]. Therefore, developing novel NH3-SCR catalysts with a broad operation temperature window has attracted more and more attention. Attracted by the unique abilities of CeO2, over which the electron transfer can be shifted between Ce3+ and Ce4+ and variable levels of oxygen vacancies can be accommodated, Ce-based catalysts have been explored for the NH3-SCR of NOx recently [6–11]. Ce/TiO2 catalyst was found to be a kind of effective NH3-SCR catalyst and the better dispersion of active Ce sites contributes to improving the activity [12,13]. Over Ce/TiO2 catalyst the amorphous CeO2 was favorable for the NH3-SCR activity [14], however, N2O is prone to be formed as the temperature is above 350°C [14]. Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst is more active than Mn/TiO2 for the reduction of NOx. The activity of Mn-Ce/TiO2 is closely related to the Ce/Mn atomic ratio and the optimum Ce/Mn molar ratio is 0.4 [15]. The introduction of MoO3 to Ce/TiO2 leads to a noticeable increase of the low-temperature activity due to the formation of more Brønsted acid sites [16]. Similar promoting effect of WO3 over Ce-W-Ti catalyst was also observed by He et al. [17]. A series of transition metal oxides of V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu supported on anatase TiO2 have been investigated by Smirniotis et al. [18] for the low-temperature NH3-SCR of NOx and the catalytic performance decreased in the order of Mn>Cu≥Cr≫Co>Fe≫V⋙Ni. Although Ni is not active for the reduction of NOx, the selectivity to N2 is nearly 100%, which is much higher than those of Mn, Cu and Cr [18]. Over Ni-Mn bi-metal oxide catalyst the synergetic effect between Ni and Mn not only resulted in higher activity but also N2 selectivity [19]. The promoting effect of Ni was also observed over Ni-doped Mn/TiO2 catalyst [20]. The co-doping of Ni into the Mn/TiO2 inhibits the formation of surface Mn2O3 sites while facilitates the formation of surface MnO2 phase, which plays an important role for the enhanced SCR activity. To the best of our knowledge, little research on the Ni-Ce-Ti mixed oxide catalyst for the NH3-SCR of NOx has been reported. Considering that the redox property of the catalyst and the amorphous structure are closely related to the NH3-SCR performance, the amorphous Ni-Ce-Ti mixed oxide catalyst with redox cycles (Ni3+ +Ce3+ ↔Ni2+ +Ce4+) was first fabricated. It was found that Ni-Ce-Ti mixed oxide is a superior catalyst for NH3-SCR of NOx. High NOx conversion together with 100% N2 selectivity can be achieved in a wide temperature range of 250–450°C. Based on the catalyst characterization and in-situ DRIFTS studies, the structure-activity relationship and the reaction mechanism have been proposed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Ni-Ce-Ti catalysts with various molar ratios of Ni/Ce/Ti, denoted as NixCeyTi1-x-y(x and y represent molar fractions of Ni and Ce, respectively), were prepared by the hydrothermal method. The aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and Ti(SO4)2 were mixed fully with required molar ratios, ammonia solution was then added slowly into the above mixed solution under vigorous stirring until pH is ca. 11. Subsequently the obtained suspension was transferred to a Teflon-sealed autoclave and held at 120°C for 24h. After the as-obtained precipitates were filtered and washed with deionized water, the resulting precipitant was dried at 120°C overnight and then calcined at 500°C in air for 6h. For comparison, Ni-Ti and Ce-Ti catalysts were also prepared by the same preparation method as described above. The state-of-the art SCR V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst with 1wt.%V2O5 and 5wt.% WO3 was prepared by the conventional impregnation method using NH4VO3, (NH4)10W12O41 as precursors and TiO2 as the support. After impregnation, the sample was dried at 120°C for 12h and then calcined at 500°C for 4h. 2.2 Catalytic performance tests The catalytic measurements for the NH3-SCR of NOx were conducted in a fixed-bed quartz reactor using 0.12g catalyst. The typical reaction feed gas consisted of 500ppm NO, 500ppm NH3, 5% O2, 0 or 5% H2O, 0 or 50ppm SO2 and balanced with N2 at a flow rate of 300cm3 min−1. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) is 64,000h−1. The concentrations of reactants and products were measured by online NO/NO2 analyzer (Thermo Scientific, model 42i-HL) and a FTIR spectrometer (Gasmet FTIR DX4000). The NOx conversion and N2 selectivity were calculated via the following equations: N O x conversion= [ N O x ] i n − [ N O x ] o u t [ N O x ] i n × 100 % N 2 selectivity= [ N O x ] i n + [ N H 3 ] i n − [ N O x ] o u t − [ N H 3 ] o u t − 2 [ N 2 O ] o u t [ N O x ] i n + [ N H 3 ] i n − [ N O x ] o u t − [ N H 3 ] o u t × 100 % 2.3 Catalyst characterization N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained at 77K using a micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. Before the measurement the catalysts were degassed at 350°C for 4h. The specific surface area was calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller(BET) equation. Pore volumes and average pore diameters were determined using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method from the desorption branch of the N2 adsorption isotherm. XRD studies were performed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE system with Cu Kα radiation. Raman spectroscopy (Renisaw, InVia) was also used to analyze the structure of the catalyst under the 532nm−1 excitation laser light. XPS spectra were recorded on an ESCALab220i-XL photoelectron spectrometer (VG Scientific) with Mg Kα as a radiation source. All binding energies were calibrated by C 1s signal at 284.8eV. Positron annihilation experiments were performed with a fast-slow coincidence ORTEC system with a time resolution of 196ps full width at half maximum. A 5×105 Bq source of 22Na was sandwiched between two identical samples. H2-TPR experiments and NH3-TPD were performed on Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 using 0.1g catalyst. Prior to H2-TPR the studied samples were first pretreated in a flow of N2 at 350°C for 1h and then cooled down to room temperature. Subsequently the feeding gas was switched from N2 to 10% H2/N2 (50mLmin−1) and the temperature was increased up to 650°C with a ramping rate of 10°Cmin−1. In the case of NH3-TPD, the sample was pretreated at 350°C in a flow of N2 for 1h, then it was cooled down to 100°C and saturated with 10% NH3/N2 for 1h, followed by purging with N2 for 30min. Finally, the sample was heated from 100 to 500°C at a rate of 10°Cmin−1 under N2 flow. 2.4 In-situ DRIFTS studies In-situ DRIFTS spectra were collected at a spectral resolution of 4cm−1 on a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a DRIFT cell (Harrick) and highly sensitive MCT detector. Prior to each experiment the sample was pretreated in a flow of N2 at 400°C for 1h. The background spectrum was collected in flowing N2 at each target temperature and automatically subtracted from the sample spectrum. For the adsorption of NH3 (or NO+O2), the sample was exposed to a flow of NH3 (or NO+O2) for 60min at each temperature, then the spectra were taken. For the transient studies, the sample was first pre-exposed to a flow of NH3 (or NO+O2) for 60min at 300°C, then purged with N2 for 30min, subsequently switching the gas to NO+O2 (or NH3) to find the dynamic changes of the DRIFT spectra. All spectra were acquired by averaging 100 scans with a resolution of 4cm−1. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Comparison of NH3-SCR performances The NH3-SCR activity and N2 selectivity of Ni0.3Ti0.7, Ce0.1Ti0.9 and Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalysts as a function of temperature were shown in Fig. 1 . It can be seen that Ni0.3Ti0.7 catalyst exhibited poor NOx conversion, with only 49% NOx conversion obtained even the temperature reached up to 450°C. Ce0.1Ti0.9 exhibited higher activity than Ni0.3Ti0.7 catalyst, however, the N2 selectivity was decreased significantly above 300°C and it is as low as about 40% at 400°C. Compared with Ni0.3Ti0.7 and Ce0.1Ti0.9 catalysts, Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalyst exhibited highly remarkable catalytic activity, with over 90% NOx conversion obtained in a wide operation temperature window (250–450°C). Moreover, 100% N2 selectivity was achieved in the whole temperature range investigated. As shown in Fig. S1, for Ce0.1Ti0.9 catalyst the NH3 conversion in the NH3-SCR of NOx above 300°C is the highest. The unselective oxidation of NH3 leads to the decreased N2 selectivity [21]. These facts demonstrated that the co-existence of Ni and Ce leads to both high NH3-SCR activity and excellent N2 selectivity, which indicates the synergetic effects possibly exist between Ni and Ce species. The activities of Ni-Ce-Ti catalysts with different ratios of Ni/Ce/Ti were also investigated and the results were illustrated in Fig. S2. It can be seen that Ni0.1Ce0.1Ti0.8, Ni0.1Ce0.2Ti0.7, Ni0.2Ce0.1Ti0.7 also exhibited high activity, although they are less active than Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6. Over all the Ni-Ce-Ti catalysts 100% N2 selectivity can be obtained. Compared with V2O5-WO3/TiO2, all the Ni-Ce-Ti catalysts showed higher activity below 300°C. The NOx conversions over different Ni-Ce-Ti catalysts under high GHSV of 128,000h−1 are shown in Fig. S3. It is evident that the increase of GHSV only resulted in slight decrease of the activity below 250°C, but no clear influence on the high temperature activity. The co-presence of H2O and SO2 in the actual exhaust usually leads to the catalyst deactivation [17], therefore, improving the tolerance to H2O and SO2 is one of the important targets in the catalyst development. The effects of H2O and SO2 on the activity of Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 at 200 and 300°C were further investigated and the results were shown in Fig. 2 . At 200°C, the introduction of H2O and SO2 induced the decrease of the NOx conversion (from 44% to 27%). The decrease of the SCR activity could be attributed to the deposition of ammonium sulphate on the catalyst surface [17]. In the case of 300°C, the feeding of H2O and SO2 just leads to the minor decrease of the NOx conversion, and the conversion is still maintained above 92% and the N2 selectivity is 100%. After stopping H2O and SO2 from the reactant feed the SCR activity was almost recovered. This fact indicates that Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 is of high resistance against H2O and SO2 at 300°C. This could be due to the inhibition of the deposition of ammonium sulphate on the catalyst surface at relatively high temperatures. 3.2 N2-physisorption, XRD and Raman spectra Table 1 presented the specific surface area and total pore volume of Ni0.3Ti0.7, Ce0.1Ti0.9 and Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalysts. It is obvious that the surface area and pore volume decreased in the order of Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 >Ce0.1Ti0.9 >Ni0.3Ti0.7. The high surface area of Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 could contribute to the high NH3-SCR activity. The XRD patterns of Ni0.3Ti0.7, Ce0.1Ti0.9 and Ni-Ce-Ti catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 3 . Over Ni0.3Ti0.7 catalyst, the peaks assigned to the anatase and rutile phase TiO2 [16,22] as well as NiTiO3 [23] can be observed. Ce0.1Ti0.9 exhibited weak peaks representing the anatase phase TiO2. Over Ni-Ce-Ti catalysts, the XRD patterns are noticeably different from those of Ni0.3Ti0.7 and Ce0.1Ti0.9 catalysts. For Ni0.1Ce0.1Ti0.8 catalyst, only very weak peaks related to the anatase and rutile phase TiO2 can be observed. And no obvious peak appeared on Ni0.1Ce0.2Ti0.7, Ni0.2Ce0.1Ti0.7, Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 and Ni0.3Ce0.2Ti0.5 catalysts, indicating a complete amorphous structure formed. The structure phases of these catalysts were also investigated by the Raman analysis. As illustrated in Fig. 4 , Raman-active modes at 144cm−1 (Eg), 197cm−1 (Eg), 399cm−1 (B1g), 519cm−1 (A1g and B1g) and 639cm−1 (Eg) are observed over Ce0.1Ti0.9 catalyst, and these Raman peaks are attributed to anatase TiO2 [24]. A blue shift can be observed over Ni0.3Ti0.7 catalyst, which could be due to the formation of NiTiO3 phase formed as shown in Fig. 3. No peak was observed on Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalysts, which further demonstrated that the amorphous structure formed. As reported previously, the amorphous structure usually possessed larger surface area than the crystallized one [25]. Therefore, the BET surface area of Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 is significantly higher than those of Ni0.3Ti0.7 and Ce0.1Ti0.9 catalysts. 3.3 H2-TPR The redox property is closely related to the NH3-SCR activity of the catalyst [26,27]. H2-TPR experiments were carried out and the reduction profile of Ni0.3Ti0.7, Ce0.1Ti0.9 and Ni-Ce-Ti catalysts are shown in Fig. 5 . Ni0.3Ti0.7 shows a single reduction peak centered at 449°C, which corresponds to the reduction of Ni species [28]. Over Ce0.1Ti0.9 catalyst a noticeable peak located at around 570°C is due to the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ [29]. For Ni0.1Ce0.1Ti0.8 catalyst, the reduction peak is shifted to a lower temperature (435°C) compared with those of Ni0.3Ti0.7 and Ce0.1Ti0.9 catalysts. With increasing the ratio of Ce and Ni, the reduction peak is shifted to lower temperatures, and over Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalyst the reduction temperature is 369°C. Further increasing the ratio of Ce the reduction temperature is increased, but the temperature over Ni0.3Ce0.2Ti0.5 is still lower than that of Ni0.2Ce0.1Ti0.7. This fact suggests that the reduction process becomes easier to conduct due to the co-presence of Ni and Ce. The significant difference of the reduction behavior among Ni0.3Ti0.7, Ce0.1Ti0.9 and Ni-Ce-Ti catalysts also indicates that there is synergetic effect between Ni and Ce species. The synergetic effect can effectively promote the redox properties of the Ni-Ce-Ti mixed oxide catalyst, thus promoting the NH3-SCR reaction and resulting in the activity enhancement. 3.4 NH3-TPD Fig. 6 illustrates the NH3-TPD profiles of Ni0.3Ti0.7, Ce0.1Ti0.9 and Ni-Ce-Ti catalysts. The NH3 desorption peak centered at about 170°C is attributed to the weakly adsorbed NH3 or NH4 + [30], and the desorbed NH3 above 250°C is due to the strongly bonded NH3 [31]. Compared with Ni0.3Ti0.7 and Ce0.1Ti0.9 catalysts, an evident enhancement of adsorbed NH3 species can be observed for the Ni-Ce-Ti catalysts. This fact indicates that the co-presence of Ni and Ce resulted in improved surface acidity of the catalyst, which contributes to improving the NH3-SCR activity [16]. 3.5 XPS analysis To reveal the chemical state of different species on the surface of the catalyst, XPS analysis has been conducted and the XPS spectra of Ce3d and Ni2p of the studied catalysts are presented in Fig. 7 . As shown in Fig. 7(a), the co-existence of Ce3+ and Ce4+ is evidenced by the peaks labeled u′ and v′ (Ce3+) and those labeled u, u″, u‴, v, v″ and v‴ (Ce4+) [32,33], respectively. The calculated ratio of Ce3+ over Ce0.1Ti0.9 and Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalysts are 50.5% and 15.7%, respectively. It can be seen that the co-presence of Ni and Ce changed the chemical state of Ce species significantly, suggesting that the strong interaction between Ce and Ni exists. The introduction of Ni to Ce-Ti catalyst induces the formation of more Ce4+. Ni2p XPS spectra for Ni0.3Ti0.7 and Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalysts are exhibited in Fig. 7(b). By performing a peak fitting deconvolution, the Ni 2p3/2 spectra can be separated into two characteristic peaks at 854.3–854.6 and 855.5–856.1eV, which can be assigned to Ni2+ and Ni3+ species, respectively [19]. In addition, a shake-up satellite signal at 861.2–861.8eV also appeared, which is due to the multiple splitting in the energy level of Ni-containing oxide [34]. For Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalyst the ratio of Ni2+, calculated by Ni2+/(Ni2+ +Ni3+), is about 34.2%, which is noticeably higher than the ratio over Ni0.3Ti0.7 catalyst. The high ratio of Ni2+ over Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalyst can be attributed to the redox process of Ce4+/Ce3+, which could transfer electron to Ni3+, leading to the great conversion of Ce3+ to Ce4+. O1s XPS spectra, which are deconvoluted with two sub-bands, are illustrated in Fig. 8 . The peak located at 529.1–529.8eV is considered to be the lattice oxygen – (denoted as Oβ), and the other at 531.1–531.9eV can be attributed to the surface adsorbed oxygen (denoted as Oα) such as O2 2− or O− bounding to defect oxide [17,35,36]. It can be seen that the relative concentration ratio of surface adsorbed oxygen Oα/(Oα +Oβ) is decreased in the order of Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 >Ce0.1Ti0.9 >Ni0.3Ti0.7. This fact indicates that more oxide defects formed over Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalyst. Surface adsorbed oxygen is of higher mobility than lattice oxygen and it is considered to be beneficial for the NH3-SCR of NOx [37]. 3.6 Positron annihilation analysis In order to further investigate the defects of Ni0.3Ti0.7, Ce0.1Ti0.9 and Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalysts, we performed Positron annihilation experiments, which demonstrated to be a useful technique to study defects in materials [38]. The type and relative concentration of various defects/vacancies even at the ppm level can be reflected by the lifetime of the positron. The positron lifetime spectra of Ni0.3Ti0.7, Ce0.1Ti0.9 and Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 presented three distinct lifetime components, τ 1, τ 2, and τ 3, with relative intensities I 1, I 2, and I 3 (see Table 2 ). The longest component (τ 3) was attributed to the annihilation of orthopositronium atoms present in the large voids of the material [39]. τ 1 and τ 2 were assigned to small neutral oxygen vacancy associates and larger size defects, such as vacancy clusters in SiO2 and CeO2, respectively [38,40]. Besides the lifetime of the positron, its relative intensity (I), which quantifies the amount of the vacancy with respect to some standard of the same material, provided more information on the distribution of these defects. Average lifetime (τ av = τ 1 I 1 + τ 2 I 2 + τ 3 I 3) can reflect the overall situation of defects and the calculated results are presented in Table 2. It is well worthy to note that the concentration of the defects decreased in the order of Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 >Ce0.1Ti0.9 >Ni0.3Ti0.7, which is in accordance with the order of the SCR activities of these three catalysts. This fact suggests that the concentration of defects is closely related to the catalytic activity of the catalyst. 3.7 In-situ DRIFTS studies 3.7.1 Adsorption of NH3 DRIFT experiments were conducted to acquire the information on the surface species over the catalysts. NH3 adsorption on Ni0.3Ti0.7, Ce0.1Ti0.9 and Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalysts as a function of temperature is illustrated in Fig. 9 . After NH3 adsorption several bands at 3386, 3255, 3141, 1671, 1592, 1477, 1434 and 1176cm−1 appeared on Ce0.1Ti0.9 catalyst (see Fig. 9(a)). The bands at 1671, 1477 and 1434cm−1 can be assigned to NH4 + species on Brønsted acid sites [17,26], whereas the bands at 1592 and 1176cm−1 can be ascribed to asymmetric and symmetric bending vibrations of NH3 on Lewis acid sites [41,42], and those at 3386, 3255 and 3141cm−1 is related to the NH stretching vibration modes of the coordinated NH3 [43]. On Ni0.3Ti0.7 catalyst (see Fig. 9(b)), besides the NH4 + species on Brønsted acid sites and NH3 on Lewis acid sites, the scissoring vibration mode of NH2 species (1554cm−1) [16] and the intermediates of ammonia oxidation (1373cm−1) [44] can also be observed. As illustrated in Fig. 9(c), both the peaks assigned to NH3 bound to Lewis acid sites and NH4 + species on Brønsted acid sites were observed on Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalyst. It is evident that the intensities of the bands ascribed to NH3 bound to Lewis acid sites (3370, 3268, 3154) are higher than those on Ni0.3Ti0.7 and Ce0.1Ti0.9 catalysts. More importantly, new peaks ascribed to NH3 on Lewis acid sites(1307, 1241 and 1101cm−1) [9,24] appeared. The peak position of the NH3 on Lewis acid sites over Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 is significantly different from those of Ce0.1Ti0.9 and Ni0.3Ti0.7 catalysts, indicating that the strong interaction between Ni and Ce modify the adsorption behavior of NH3, and the adsorption and activation of NH3 was promoted due to the synergetic effect between them. This is in accordance with the NH3-TPD results as shown in Fig. 6. 3.7.2 Adsorption of NO+O2 The DRIFT spectra of NO+O2 on Ni0.3Ti0.7, Ce0.1Ti0.9 and Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalysts at different temperatures are presented in Fig. 10 . As shown in Fig. 10(a), over Ce0.1Ti0.9 catalyst the peaks ascribed to NO2 molecules (1616cm−1) [45], bidentate nitrate (1577cm−1) [24,46], M-NO2 nitro compounds (1365cm−1) [47], monodentate nitrate (1286cm−1) [21] and bridging nitrate (1249cm−1) [46] were detected. With increasing temperature, the intensities of the peaks assigned to NO2, bidentate nitrate, monodentate nitrate and bridging nitrate are decreased. However, the intensity of the peak related to M-NO2 nitro compounds is increased. This fact indicates that the surface species could be transformed to different species as the temperature increased. From Fig. 10(b) it can be seen that over Ni0.3Ti0.7 catalyst besides NO2, bidentate nitrate, M-NO2 nitro compounds, monodentate nitrate and bridging nitrate species, trans-N2O2 2− (1488cm−1) [9] species is also observed. Compared with Fig. 10(a) and (b), it is obvious that the intensities of the peaks ascribed to the monodentate nitrate and bridging nitrate over Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalyst are significantly higher than those over Ni0.3Ti0.7 and Ce0.1Ti0.9 catalysts. This fact indicates that the synergetic effect between Ni and Ce facilitates the formation of monodentate nitrate and bridging nitrate. 3.7.3 Reactivity of surface adsorbed species In order to calrify the reactivity of the adsorbed NOx species in the NH3-SCR reaction over Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalyst, the time-dependent changes of the in-situ DRIFT spectra in a flow of NH3 after the catalyst was pre-adsorbed NO+O2 for 60min followed by N2 purging at 250°C was investigated and the results are illustrated in Fig. 11 . After switching the gas to NH3, the intensities of the peaks assigned to NO2 (1617cm−1), M-NO2 nitro species (1367cm−1) and monodentate nitrate (1540 and 1288cm−1) are decreased rapidly, indicating that these adsorbed NOx species are reactive. Simultaneously, the bands related to NH3 species (3367, 3259, 3168, 1606, 1367, 1309 and 1240cm−1) and NH4 + species (1473cm−1) appeared in 5min. The reactivity of adsorbed NH3 species was also investigated and Fig. 12 showed the dynamic changes of the in-situ DRIFT spectra of Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalyst in a flow of NO+O2 after the catalyst was pre-exposed to a flow of NH3 for 60min followed by N2 purging at 250°C. It can be seen that switching the gas to NO+O2 led to the decrease of the intensities of all peaks assigned to NH3 adsorbed on Lewis acid sites, NH4 + on Brønsted acid sites and deformation species of adsorbed NH3, and those peaks disappeared in 5min. At the same time the bands assigned to NOx species (1619, 1548, 1365 and 1282cm−1) appeared. The above result indicates that both the adsorbed NH3 and NH4 + on are reactive in the reduction of NOx. Fig. S4 showed the in situ DRIFT spectra of Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalyst at various temperatures during the reaction of 500ppm NH3, 500ppm NO and 5% O2 under the steady-state condition. Compared with Fig. 9(c), the intensities of these bands related to NH3 are noticeably decreased and these peaks almost disappear above 250°C, suggesting that adsorbed NH3 species are very reactive. Previous research showed that the amorphous CeO2 was more active than the crystallized CeO2 for the NH3-SCR of NOx [25]. From the XRD patterns it can be seen that both Ni0.3Ti0.7 and Ce0.1Ti0.9 catalysts present crystal structure. In contrast, the peaks observed over Ni0.1Ce0.1Ti0.8 catalyst is very weak, and Ni0.1Ce0.2Ti0.7, Ni0.2Ce0.1Ti0.7, Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 and Ni0.3Ce0.2Ti0.5 catalysts are of amorphous structure, which is beneficial for the NH3-SCR activity. This fact indicates that the amorphous structure is due to the strong interaction between Ni and Ce species. According to the XPS analysis, two redox couples Ce4+/Ce3+ and Ni3+/Ni2+ exist over Ni-Ce-Ti catalyst and they form the redox cycle (Ni3+ +Ce3+ ↔Ni2+ +Ce4+), which facilitates the electron transfer between Ni and Ce, thus resulting in the improved redox property of Ni-Ce-Ti catalyst as shown in Fig. 5. Both the redox property and the surface acidity of the catalyst are demonstrated to play important roles in the NH3-SCR activity [16,24]. As shown in H2-TPR and NH3-TPD profiles (see Figs. 5 and 6), for the Ni-Ce-Ti catalysts, the redox property is decreased in the order of Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 >Ni0.3Ce0.2Ti0.5 >Ni0.2Ce0.1Ti0.7 >Ni0.1Ce0.2Ti0.7 >Ni0.1Ce0.1Ti0.8, whereas the surface acidity is decreased in the order of Ni0.2Ce0.1Ti0.7 >Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 >Ni0.1Ce0.2Ti0.7 >Ni0.1Ce0.1Ti0.8 >Ni0.3Ce0.2Ti0.5. Both the redox property and surface acidity, collectively, explain the similar NH3-SCR activity of these Ni-Ce-Ti catalysts (see Fig. S2). Ce-W-Ti catalysts with different molar ratios of Ce/W/Ti also showed similar NH3-SCR activity [17]. Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 is more active, which could be due to the highest redox property and relatively high surface acidity. The lowest acidity of Ni0.3Ce0.2Ti0.5 could be responsible for its relatively low NOx conversion at high temperatures. The synergetic effect between Ni and Ce induces more Ce4+ and Ni2+ present over Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalyst. As reported previously, Ce4+ contributes to the formation of coordinated NH3 on Lewis acid sites [48]. Therefore, over Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalyst the intensities of the peaks ascribed to coordinated NH3 on Lewis acid sites is higher than those over Ce0.1Ti0.9 catalyst (see Fig. 9). These results are in good accordance with the reported literatures, where the doping of Ni can significantly enhance the concentration of Lewis acid sites on Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts [20,49]. From Fig. 9(c), it can be seen that with increasing temperature the intensities of the peaks assigned to NH3 on Lewis acid sites (1614, 1307, 1241 and 1101cm−1) rarely decreased. This fact indicates that the Lewis acid sites over Ni0.3Ce0.1Ti0.6 catalyst possess higher acid strength. The adsorbed NH3 species on Lewis acid sites are demonstrated to be reactive in the reduction of NOx as shown in Fig. 12. Lietti et al. [50] reported that the adsorbed NH3 bound to the Lewis acid sites can react with gas-phase NO to form N2. More Ni2+ present over Ni-Ce-Ti catalyst can induce more oxygen vacancies formed, as demonstrated by positron annihilation analysis. The oxygen vacancies would promote the adsorption and activation of gas-phase oxygen, thus forming the activated oxygen atom, which then facilitates the formation of reactive monodentate nitrate species. As shown in Fig. 11, the monodentate nitrate is reactive. Liu et al. [46] also proposed that monodentate nitrate can react with NH3 or NH4 + to form N2. A combination of monodentate nitrate and NH3 coordinated to Lewis acid sites is important for high activity and selectivity [51]. Based on the in-situ DRIFTS studies, it can be seen that over Ni-Ce-Ti catalyst the coordinated NH3 on Lewis acid sites would react with gas phase NO (E-R mechanism) to form N2. On the other hand, weakly adsorbed NO2, M-NO2 nitro species and monodentate nitrate would also react with NH4 + or activated NH3 via the L-H mechanism. The synergetic effect between Ni and Ce over Ni-Ce-Ti catalyst contributes to the formation of reactive adsorbed NH3 species and monodentate nitrate. As a result, the NH3-SCR of NOx is promoted over Ni-Ce-Ti mixed oxide catalyst. 4 Conclusions Ni-Ce-Ti oxide catalyst has been demonstrated to be active and selective for the NH3-SCR of NOx in a wide operation temperature window. Compared with Ni-Ti and Ce-Ti catalysts, Ni-Ce-Ti catalyst is more active. The synergetic effect between Ni and Ce leads to the formation of amorphous structure, more oxygen vacancies and high redox property by the redox cycle (Ni3+ +Ce3+ ↔Ni2+ +Ce4+). In situ DRIFT experiments showed that the synergetic effect between Ni and Ce promotes the formation of reactive NH3 on Lewis acid sites and monodentate nitrate, and consequently improving the NH3-SCR performance.

It was found that Ni-Ce-Ti catalyst showed high NH3-SCR activity, excellent N2 selectivity with broad operation temperature window. Based on the catalyst characterization, the redox cycle (Ni3+ +Ce3+ ↔Ni2+ +Ce4+), the amorphous structure and more surface defects over Ni-Ce-Ti catalyst are responsible for the high catalytic deNOx performance.
