It is proposed that sodium migrated from the surface of the metal catalyst to the zeolite via the solid-state reaction.

Introduction Iron-based catalysts have been widely utilized in Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis, in which the product distribution is limited by the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) polymerization kinetics [1]. It is well known that the addition of a reducible metal such as Cu enhances the catalytic activity of Fe catalysts [2]. In the F-T reaction, the major products are linear hydrocarbons, while the branched products are the more valuable [1]. Composite catalysts composed of two different catalysts have recently been used to improve the distribution [3-6]. By combining Corresponding author.

PI1S1381-1169(97)00014-9 the F-T catalyst and zeolite, branched hydrocarbons form via the acidic carbon-homologation of primary olefins on zeolite. FeCu/zeolite is expected to be valid for obtaining branched products. Zeolites can change the function of F-T catalysts, as recently revealed for Fe-Zn0/HY [7]. Fe-Zn0/HY behaved as the composite catalyst combining methanol synthesis and MTG reaction, although Fe-Zn0 catalyzed the F-T reaction. Enhancement of conversion has not been reported for F-T catalyst/zeolite composite catalysts so far [8]. In this paper, we reveal new results that physical mixing of zeolites with Fe-Cu catalysts drastically improves the activity of the F-T catalysts and enhances generation of branched and heavier products in the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. The solid-state reac- L24 Q. Xu et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 120 (1997) L23-L26 tion between the oxides and zeolites leading to the novel effects is also discussed. 2. Experimental Fe-Cu-Na catalysts were prepared by coprecipitation from the iron and copper nitrates with sodium hydroxide. Sodium contents were controlled by washing the precipitates. The precipitates were dried at 110 for 6 h and calcined at 400 for 4 h in air. The composite catalysts were obtained by physical mixing of equal amounts of Fe-Cu-Na oxides and zeolites (the reference catalysts of the Catalysis Society of Japan). After reducing the samples in a flow of HZ diluted with N2 (10% HZ/N2, 3000 ml g-' h- i ) for 6 h at 350, the catalysts were kept at 250 in a flow of reaction gas (H2/C02 = 3, S V = 3000 ml g-1 h -' ) under 20 atm. The reactants and products were analyzed with an on-line gas chromatograph system. Table 1 Hydrogenation of carbon dioxide over Fe-Cu-Na/zeolite composite catalysts 3. Results and discussion Table 1 summarizes the results of the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide over the Fe-Cu catalysts and their composite catalysts. By using a Na-rich catalyst (Cl), hydrocarbons were obtained with Schulz-Flory distribution, in which a large amount of olefins but small amounts of branched and higher hydrocarbons appeared, as well known in the F-T reaction [1]. It is well known that alkalis enhance the formation of olefins [9] and therefore more branched hydrocarbons are expected to form via the acidic carbon-homologation of primary olefins over the catalysts combining both zeolites and the Na-containing F-T catalysts. By adding zeolites to the catalyst Cl, striking features were observed. The physical mixing led to a drastic enhancement of C02 conversion (6.8 (Cl) - 11.8 (C4), 11.5 (C5), 12.3 (C6) and 12.3 (C9) C-mol%) and improved yields of hydrocarbons, although zeolite does not possess Cat Fe-Cu- Zeolite n Conv, of Convert to C-mol% C- Cb No. Na a COZ (%) CO C, C,-C, C5+ Oxy a Ratio t Ratio ci A - 6.8 69.0 4.7 14.4 9.0 2.9 70.5 2.9 C2 A Si02-A1203 (4.2) `a 8.1 33.4 18.9 25.1 15.0 7.8 17.6 4.6 C3 A HY(4.8) ` 8.2 33.4 21.3 32.5 12.8 0 1.1 69.6 C4 A HMOR(9.8) ` 11.8 23.7 17.6 36.6 21.8 0.3 15.7 44.0 CS A US-Y(10.7) 11.5 22.7 24.0 36.3 17.0 0 0.3 77.3 C6 A HZSM-5(25) ` 12.3 19.6 22.9 34.0 23.5 0 3.1 64.6 C7 A HZSM-5 (1000) ` 7.9 54.6 8.4 17.7 13.3 6.0 41.5 3.1 C8 A SiOz 7.4 63.9 5.8 13.4 9.7 7.3 32.7 2.8 C9 A NaY(4.8) ` 12.3 18.5 20.4 33.4 21.0 6.7 6.0 4.2 C10 B - 13.8 20.8 26.5 35.7 11.8 5.2 2.9 7.2 Cil B HY(4.8) ` 8.4 25.5 33.5 36.0 5.1 0 0.6 61.5 C12 B US-Y(10.7) 12.5 14.8 35.1 41.4 8.7 0 0.5 76.4 250, 20 atm, SV = 3000 ml/g-catal./h, Hz/COZ = 3.

Xu et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 120 (1997) G23-G26 F-T activity, or ability to promote the reduction of Fe. With HMOR (C4), US-Y (C5) and HZSM-5 (C6), the branched hydrocarbons, minor in the F-T reaction but more desirable, and the heavier (C5+) hydrocarbons increased, while the amount of olefins decreased in the products. Therefore, the olefins seem to be polymerized to give heavier hydrocarbons. On the other hand, only a slight change in the activity was observed for the reaction on the catalysts with the zeolites having a lower ratio of Si02/A1203, Si02-A1203 (C2) and HY (C3), and higher ratio, HZSM-5 (C7) and Si02 (C8). NaY, a Na-type zeolite, raised the conversion, but the ratio of branched products (C9) was maintained. A Na-poor catalyst and its composite catalysts were also examined (C10-C12). Since Na is known to inhibit the reduction of Fe [ 10], the Na-poor Fe-Cu catalyst showed a higher COZ conversion than the Na-rich one, but less olefins appeared in the products. By physically mixing acidic zeolites, conversion of COZ decreased, and less C5+ hydrocarbons appeared in the products. H-type zeolites with a higher Si/Al ratio, which have less acidic sites, deactivated the F-T activity to a slight degree, and the Na-type ones, which have no acidic sites, did not deactivate it. This indicates that the acidic sites are closely related to the deactivating process. Since the activity of the catalysts did not decline during the reaction, it is concluded that the catalysts were deactivated during the pretreatment, and therefore any coke-formation can be excluded. With the Na-poor F-T catalyst or its composite catalysts, we could not obtain products which included large amounts of both heavier and branched hydrocarbons. Physical mixing of zeolites with Na-rich catalysts drastically improves activity and selectivity of branched and heavier hydrocarbons. Here we propose a plausible model of Na migration to explain our interesting observations. During the solid-state reaction between the oxides and the zeolites, Na on the surface of the oxides migrates to the zeolites. This leads to an en- L25 hancement in the reduction of Fe [ 10], and subsequently to a rise in the F-T activity. Branched and heavier hydrocarbons formed via the acidic carbon-homologation on the partially Na+ ion-exchanged H-type zeolites. Similar solid-state reactions have been reported for alkaline, and alkaline-earth metal chlorides /zeolite systems [11,12]. The slight change in the activity observed in the reaction with Si02-AIZO3 (C2) and HY (C3) results from the deactivation of the F-T sites by the acidic sites of zeolites competing with the enhancement effect due to Na migration. No apparent change in activity was observed with HZSM-5 (Si02/A1203 = 1000, C7) and Si02 (C8), while the acidic deactivation can be neglected due to the lack of acidic sites. On the other hand, a marked enhancement of activity was observed in the reaction of the Na-type zeolites (C9). The results suggest that Na smoothly migrated to the Natype zeolites, but not to the Al-poor materials. It turned out that Na affinity is affected by the polarization effect of [A104]-, and does not depend on the structure of the pore in the zeolite nor on whether the zeolite is an H-type one or not. Preliminary XRD and TG-DTA measurements exhibited evidences of Na migration. There were no distinct differences of the XRD patterns of HY zeolite in the composite catalyst C3 before and after the reaction. However, the crystallinity of HY zeolite decreased during the reaction in a composite catalyst containing about twenty times more Na than C3, reflecting that a large amount of Na migrated from the surface of the metal oxides to the zeolite, which lowered the hydrothermal stability and injured the zeolite lattice under the reaction conditions [13]. TG measurements with a constant flow of 10%H 2/Ar at 250 showed that the reduction of iron oxides in the Na-rich catalyst (C1), which proceeded slower than that in the Na-poor catalyst (C10), was accelerated by physical mixing of HY (C3). Further verification of the model is expected from detailed spectroscopic studies (currently underway). In conclusion, solid-state reactions between physically-mixed L26 Q.
