Reactions of cyclopropane and of ethane with hydrogen on ruthenium/titania catalysts; reaction mechanisms Geoffrey C. Bond and Rosiyah Yahya Department of Chemistry, Brunel University, Uxbridge UB8 3PH (71.K.) (Received November 23, 1990; accepted February 6, 1991) Ostract The hydrogenation of cyclopropane to propane is accompanied by hydrogenolysis to equimolar amounts of methane and ethane on a Ruit'i02 catalyst pretreated both by highand low-temperature reduction (HTR or LTR). The rate after oxidation and LTR is much faster than after a second HTR, when (due to the absence of Cl-) the catalyst enters the SMSI state. Even more marked variations of rate with pretreatment are found with ethane. Cleavage of the second C-C bond in cyclopropane is detectable just above room temperature, where the (extrapolated) rates for propane and ethane hydrogenolysis would be negligible. Previous proposals to account for this process are examined, and found wanting. The dissociation of cyclopropane into adsorbed methylene and ethene is thought to be a more plausible route to the hydrogenolysis products. Introduction The effect of metal particle size and surface morphology on the catalytic behaviour shown by supported metal catalysts continues to be a lively field of research. In a number of earlier papers [ 1-31, we have demonstrated how the activities of RuJri02 for alkane hydrogenolyses depend markedly on the pretreatment used. Starting with RuC13/TiO2, reduction at 758 K (HTR1) gives moderate activities (depending on the Ru content) which are substantially determined by the level of the residual Cl-; amongst other effects, this seems to prevent the metal from entering the SMSI state. Subsequent oxidation (623 K) and low temperature reduction (433 K; LTR) results in much higher activities and somewhat higher dispersions which do not, however, fully account for the greater rates [3]; at the same time much of the Cl- is removed, so that a second reduction at 758 K (HTR2) leads to very low activities due to the SMSI effect. We have also found similar but less marked effects with Si02 and A1203 as supports [3]. Schmidt and coworkers have reported [4] extremely large variations of rate for `annealed' and `oxidised' samples of a number of supported metals, but their pretreatment temperatures and particle sizes differ substantially from ours. We have also found large effects with Ir/Ti02, but curiously not with Os/Ti02 [5]. 0304-5102/91/$3.50 0 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 244 The high rates and values of TOF observed for hydrogenolysis after LTR appear to imply that this treatment increases the surface roughness of the metal particles and hence creates better active centres. It is now of interest to see whether the same effect operates in a hydrogenation, and we have selected cyclopropane hydrogenation for this purpose. This reaction has a reputation for structure-insensitivity [6], but it is doubtful whether this is deserved as far as Ru catalysts go [ 7, 8 ] . A curious feature of the reaction is the tendency to form, in addition to propane by hydrogenation, ethane and methane by hydrogenolysis at temperatures well below that at which C-C bonds are usually broken [7-12]: moreover, complete conversion to methane only occurs on particles larger than - 5 run in size [7]. One possible explanation is the great stability of adsorbed CZ species, reflected in the difficulty of hydrogenolysing ethane to methane. It is therefore of interest to compare rates of reaction of cyclopropane, propane and ethane on the same or similar catalysts, to establish whether common adsorbed intermediates are involved, or whether some new mechanism needs to be invoked to account for the breaking of the second C-C bond in cyclopropane. Results for propane hydrogenolysis on Ru/Ti02 catalysts are already available [ 12 ]; we have now investigated the reactions of ethane and of cyclopropane with HZ on Ru/Ti02 catalysts pretreated in different ways, and the results are reported below. Previous publications [ 7-12 ] dealing with these reactions on Ru catalysts will be considered in the Discussion section. Experimental Catalysts were prepared by impregnation to incipient wetness of Degussa P-25 Ti02 (- 55 m2 g-'; - 80% anatase) with aqueous solutions of RuCl3 -xH20 (42.07 wt.% Ru), the salt being obtained on loan from Johnson Matthey plc; the material was then dried in air overnight at 383 K. Nominal metal loadings were 0.5, 1 and 5 wt.%. The 19'o catalyst was analysed by dissolving the Ru salt in HCl (35 wt.%) in a Soxhlet apparatus and estimating the amount of Ru by AAS: it contained 0.88% Ru. Each sample (^- 0.2 g) was first reduced in situ in pure HZ (16 h, 758 K: HTR1) and then tested: it was then oxidised in air (1 h, 623 K) and after flushing with NZ was reduced in HZ (1 h, 433 K: LTR). After a second test, the high-temperature reduction was repeated (HTR1) and a final test carried out. The 1% Ru/Ti02 catalyst was characterised by TEM after each of these pretreatments, using a JEOL 100 CX instrument: samples were prepared by grinding, ultrasonication in acetone and suspension on a carbon-coated grid. Room temperature H2 chemisorption isotherms were measured with 0.5 to 1 g of this catalyst after each of the pretreatments, followed by outgassing at 573 K for 1 h. Dispersions are reported as H/Ru ratios based on HZ uptakes extrapolated to zero pressure. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was performed using 596 HZ/Ar (40 cm' min-', 5 K min-', - 150 245 mg) and temperature-programmed HC1 evolution with pure HZ under similar conditions. Hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis was performed in a continuous-flow system at atmospheric pressure, using the following flow-rates (in cm' min-'): H2, 100; hydrocarbon, 10; N2, 30. Measurements were made in a single risingtemperature stage in which the temperature was raised automatically in steps of 10 K every 20 min, the effluent from the reactor being sampled 18 min after each temperature rise. Conversions were confined to the range 0.1-l0O, products being analysed by a 4 m squalane/A1203 column at 363 K. Arrhenius plots in the temperature ranges specified in the tables of results gave correlation coefficients > 0.995; rates are based on reactant removal, and product selectivities are defined as before [ 1-31. Results Characterisation of 1 % Ru/Ti02 TPR of the dried precursor showed that about 75% of the total H2 consumed was taken up in a single step occurring between 300 and 480 K (Tm~-370 K), the remaining 25ss'o being removed between 500 and 650 K: the total H2 consumption corresponded to an H:Ru ratio of 3.28. The HTR1 pretreatment certainly gives complete reduction to Ru(0). However in the TP-HCl evolution experiment, no HCl appears below 770 K; the maximum rate occurs at - 820 K, and above 840 K (where - 90ss'o of the total HCl has been released) the evolution becomes much slower. It is therefore equally certain that the HTR1 schedule leaves the majority of the Cl- on the catalyst. The form of the H2 isotherm arouses suspicion in that the volume adsorbed continues to rise in the equilibrium pressure range 0-2 kPa, and only above this is there a linear phase which can be confidently extrapolated to give a volume adsorbed at zero pressure. Except after HTR2, these volumes are some 30ss'o less than those found at 5 kPa. We have previously noted [31 that this behaviour is symptomatic of CI --contaminated materials, and although we have used the H/Ru ratios derived from the zero-pressure uptake (HTR1, 0.134; LTR, 0.168: HTR2, 0.049) to estimate TOFs, we have limited confidence in their values. Our doubts were confirmed by the TEM results. After HTRl, there were very well dispersed particles of 1.5 0.5 nm in size; this corresponds to a dispersion of - 70%. After LTR, only a few very small particles ( - 1 rim) were visible; presumably the rest were too small to be seen. However after HTR2 a number of larger particles in a variety of sizes (5.5 2.5 nm) were clearly seen; this is consistent with the dispersion found by H2 chemisorption. Ethane hydrOOlysis The hydrogenolysis of ethane was carried out on Ru/Ti02 catalysts containing 0.5, 1 and 5ss'o Ru, after each of the three standard pretreatments; the Arrhenius parameters are recorded in Table 1 and the plots for the lO Ru/T102 are shown in Fig. 1.

Since however the extent of the curvature depended on the pretreatment used, being least after HTR1, the effect is unlikely to be due to mass-transport limitation and is more probably associated with changes in the orders of reaction with temperature. 247 For the 1 and 5% Ru/Ti02 catalysts, the rates after LTR were much faster than after either of the HTRs, being 10-20 times faster than those after HTRI and 40-70 times faster than after HTR2. Activation energies were lower by i 5-25 kJ mol- ` after LTR compared with those found after the HTRs, in accord with previous observations [2]. With these catalysts it is clear that the same factors were at work as have been noted previously, and were outlined in the Introduction. Unusually, the 0.5% RLl/T102 gave about the same rates after each pretreatment and almost identical activation energies. This catalyst obviously had not undergone the same structural and compositional changes as the others, but the reason for this is not clear. A previously studied sample of the same nominal composition had shown a large effect of pretreatment on the rates of propane and n-butane hydrogenolysis [2]. Turnover frequencies for the 1% Ru/Ti02 catalyst at 433 K after HTRl, LTR and HTR2 pretreatments are estimated as respectively 0.0775 X 10-3, 1.08 X 10-' and 0.103 X 10-3 s- 1. Reactions of cyclopropane with H,2 With 1% Ru/Ti02, the reactions of cyclopropane with Hz were observable at only slightly above room temperature; after HTRI the rate of reactant removal at 333 K was 4500 times the rate for ethane hydrogenolysis at 433 K. After LTR the rate for cyclopropane increased by a factor of 2.3 (see Table 2), which is much less than the factor of 20 by which the rate for ethane rose. HTR2 produced a rate which was 25 times less than that after LTR (Table 2). Arrhenius plots for this reaction are also shown in Fig. 1; in contrast to ethane hydrogenolysis, and alkane hydrogenolysis generally, the highest activation energy is shown after LTR. In agreement with much of the literature [ 7-12 ], we find that SI and S2 are equal within experimental error throughout the entire temperature range; Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of SZ for the different pretreatments. At 325 K each pretreatment gave the same value of SZ (0.140 t 0.003), but at high temperatures (see Fig. 2) the values fell in the sequence: LTR > HTRI > HTR2. This sequence is at least partly in line with the behaviour of linear alkanes, which after LTR tend to give higher yields of methane than after the HTRs.

Temperature-dependence of hydrogenolysis selectivity (S, +SZ)/2 in the reaction of cyclopropane with HZ over 1% Ru/Ti02 catalysts, variously pretreated. Discussion The reactions of alkanes, of cyclopropane, of substituted cyclopropanes and of other cycloalkanes with HZ have been widely employed as test reactions to explore the structural subtleties of supported metal catalysts. Although, as we shall see, the literature is at odds on many points of detail, on a number of matters of substance there is almost complete consensus. For example, the reactivity of linear alkanes increases with increasing chain length, irrespective of the metal [ 13-151. Kempling and Anderson [ 161 have given relative hydrogenolysis rates for a number of linear and branched alkanes on Ru/A1203, showing that, in line with our own experience [1, 21, the introduction of branching greatly lessens reactivity. Our present results for ethane confirm the trend; rates for ethane, propane, n-butane and isobutane at 433 K after LTR are respectively 10.8, 1916, 2433 and 286 mmol gA h-' [2]. We have also confirmed that ethane hydrogenolysis experiences the same kind of rate variations with pretreatment as we have seen before with higher alkanes, although the 19'o Ru/Ti02 catalyst behaves anomalously. Very much greater divergence is found on comparing rates, Arrhenius parameters and values of TOF reported by various workers for Ru catalysts. In particular, if an assessment is made of the dependence of kinetic parameters (rate, TOF, activation energy etc.) on dispersion or particle size from literature results, enormous difficulties are encountered. While results are often provided for different temperatures and reactant pressures, the necessary information to convert them to a common base is not always to hand. More importantly, it is now clear that the power rate law formalism and the use of apparent activation energies derived from rate measurements are inadequate tools for 249 kinetic analysis: a more rigorous treatment can cause the disappearance of an apparent compensation effect and the identification of a single true activation energy derived from rate coefficients [ 171. Regrettably, sufficiently detailed results are rarely available to justify such a thorough procedure. Not only the support but also the method of preparation affect particle size and shape, and the manner of the particles' attachment to the support, and these variations in turn affect the kinetic parameters. Results obtained with zeolite-supported Ru [ 121 are particularly hard to interpret, since shape selectivity and high electric-field gradients can produce complicating effects. Finally, there is the problem of assessing the metal particles' characteristics (mean size, size distribution, [Ru]s); in particular, the use of HZ for selective chemisorption is fraught with difficulty where retained Cl- 1181 or SMSI effects [21 obtain. For these (and other) reasons, there are very few sets of data to be found in the literature on which confident statements concerning particle size effects can be based [ 19, 201. There are however one or two publications on which some reliance can be placed. We have recently shown that TOFs for hydrogenolysis of propane and of n-butane on Ru/Al203 catalysts made from the acetylacetonate decrease smoothly with increasing dispersion [211, in accord with earlier results for higher alkanes [221. The same trend has been reported for ethane hydrogenolysis by Galvagno and coworkers [ 231 for Ru/Al203 catalysts made in various ways, so the effect may be a general one, although they find little variation in rate with propane in the dispersion range investigated. Results in the same sense have also been presented recently by Smale and King [241 for ethane hydrogenolysis on Ru/SiO2 catalysts but, while their TOFs are in fair agreement with those of Galvagno et al. [231 for this type of catalyst, they are much faster than those found on Ru/A1203. Our TOF for 196 RuM02 (LTR) agrees well with published results [ 23 ] for Ru/A1203, but it is clear that there are vast and still unexplained differences in TOF for a given reaction and metal as the support is altered. In view of these observations, it is unexpected to find a report [81 showing that the TOFs for the reactions of cyclopropane (both hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis) increase significantly with increasing dispersion. More recently published results obtained by Schwank and coworkers [71 are shown in Fig. 3; they are confined to the range 0-5Oss6 dispersion, as catalysts of higher dispersion had either been prepared by a different method (carbonyl decomposition) or had a zeolite as support. However, ignoring these, there is a smooth and very substantial increase in TOF for both reactions as dispersion rises, magnesia, silica and silica-alumina being the supports used. Hydrogenation selectivity was greatest at low dispersion; in keeping with much previous work [ 7-121 and our own observations, there was no excess methane formation below 400 K, and above this temperature only with catalysts containing Ru particles greater than - 5 nm in size [ 7, 81. These observations are not easily rationalised. The variations of both the hydrogenation and selective hydrogenolysis rates with dispersion (Fig. 3) are in the opposite sense, and much greater in size, than those found 250 z 0 _4 Q a c~ ~8 -1a a 10 20 30 4050 0/1ta Fig. 3. Dependence of TOF for cyclopropane hydrogenation (A) and hydrogenolysis (B) on variously supported Ru catalysts at 330 K (7]: hatched points, Si02 A1203; open points, MgO; half-filled points, Si02. for alkane hydrogenolysis on Ru/A1203 catalysts (21, 221. However, nonselective hydrogenolysis, which is probably a result of sequential reaction of propane, does seem to require large particles, on which, as we have seen, alkane hydrogenolysis proceeds best. The range of dispersion covered by these measurements (7-43Oo) is not that in which major changes in electronic character or surface structure are to be expected. It therefore remains possible, since different supports and preparative methods were used, that an apparent particle size effect was generated by adventitious effects of the kind noted above. It would be of interest to see whether the same effect is to be found with a series of closely similar catalysts. Alternatively, the nature of the rate-determining steps in the reactions of cyclopropane may be quite different from those at work in hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes, as indeed is strongly suggested by the differences in orders of reaction and activation energies. It would then not be surprising if some other aspects of particle size, perhaps electronic rather than geometric in character, were to be the deciding factor. The results in Table 2 for the cyclopropane reaction show that rates vary with type of pretreatment, as previously found for alkanes, and that the variations are not wholly accounted for by changes in dispersion; in particular the TOF found after HTR2, when the catalyst is substantially in the SMSI state, is about eight times smaller than after LTR. This is most probably because H2 chemisorption underestimates the number of active centres, which if comprising several atoms will be much fewer in number than the surface Ru atoms as sensed by H2. This would seem to confirm the particle size sensitivity of this reaction on Ru. A similar situation arises with ethane, but here the TOFs after both HTRs are lower than that found after LTR by a factor of about 10. With cyclopropane, the rate of the hydrogenolysis increases with temperature most rapidly for the most active catalyst and vice versa (Fig. 2). 251 It is indeed a very remarkable fact that cleavage of two of the C-C bonds in the cyclopropane molecule occurs during the reaction at only slightly above ambient temperature. This observation has been made by others working with Ru [ 7-12 ], Fe [ 9 ], Ni [ 9, 25 ] and Ir [ 26 ], and has been discussed in some detail [9, 261, but none of the explanations so far advanced however seems wholly satisfactory. It was one of the objectives of this work to see whether the absence of further hydrogenolysis (except above 400 K, where as noted earlier, the further reaction of propane might take place) could be rationalised in terms of the lesser reactivity of CZ species compared to C3 species. However, comparison of our results for cyclopropane with those for ethane and for propa?e on the same or similar catalysts (Fig. 1) make it abundantly clear that the rate of both the alkane reactions at 333 K would be some orders of magnitude slower than that of the hydrogenolysis of cyclopropane. The appearance of ethane + methane at this temperature cannot therefore be due to sequential readsorption and reaction of gaseous propane; it is even unlikely that the adsorbed intermediates from which the fragments are formed are the same as those occurring during the reaction of propane. In their consideration of this problem, Wallace and Hayes [91 favoured the reaction of HZ with a 1,1,3-triadsorbed C3 species to give adsorbed methylene and ethyl groups (Scheme lA), while Engstrom and coworkers [261 advocated a similar mechanism based on a metallocyclobutane. Its rearrangement, as shown in Scheme 1B, has often been used as a basis for explaining skeletal isomerisation in higher alkanes, as well as hydrogenolysis, and is supported by observations made on organometallic complexes [261. The difficulty with these suggestions is that they do not explain why a further C-C bond breaking can occur under such mild conditions: the species invoked are those which are also called into play to account for reactions of alkanes under much more rigorous conditions. It seems more likely that the process leading to CI and CZ fragments begins with a species in which the cyclopropane ring is still intact, in order that there should be the necessary strain for bond-breaking to occur. Most workers have assumed that dissociative chemisorption of a C-C bond, giving a 1,3-diadsorbed species (Scheme 2A) is the favoured process. However, we recall that singlet methylene adds readily to an alkene to form a cyclopropane [271, and the Principle of Microscopic Reversibility would suggest that the reverse process should also be possible. If therefore cyclopropane were able to dissociate into methylene + ethene and if both were to be chemisorbed (A) HCil/ CH~IHZ +-ii6> H CH 11 2 1 x:CHj CHE B) HC~ \\ZCH= Scheme 1.

(Scheme 2B), the resulting configuration would be much more stable than the original. We would also have a ready explanation of the general failure to observe methane/ethane ratios greater than unity. If indeed this is the route by which hydragenolysis occurs, it is clearly attended by an energy barrier which is significantly high for thane metals active in hyarogenolysis, the activation energy far which is usually greater than that for hydrogenation [ 7, ss, I I;, but still very much lower than for linear alkanes; it is prohibitively high for those metals such as Pt and Pd on which no hydrogenolysis is seen [10]. We now consider whether the two reaction paths proceed through the same initial species, or whether the reactant molecule chemisarbs in a different way for each. According to our argument above, species such as I,I,3triadsorbed C3 species or metaltocyclobutane cannot be the common intermediate for both processes, although they can of course lead to propane. It is possible that cyclopropane adsorbs dissociatively as in Scheme 2B, where it can find two or three free metal atoms, whereas otherwise it reacts with an H atom to form an n-prapyl radical: this would account for the fact that orders in HZ for hydrogenolysis are substantially mare negative than for hydrogenation [I 11. Almost equivalently, reaction of gaseous or weakly adsorbed cyclopropane with an adsorbed H atom could lead either to an npropyl radical or to methyl + ethene (Scheme 2C); once again, the latter process demands more free Ru atoms and would therefore exhibit a more negative HZ order. Alternatively, attack of an H atom on an adsorbed cycloprapyl radical might trigger rearrangements of electrons as shown in Scheme 2D. There is little evidence for the irreversible adsorption of cyclopropane on clean surfaces, and this we take as further evidence supporting an H-atommediated step. On balance we feel that the initial step is more probably an attack by an adsorbed H atom on the C3 ring rather than the cleavage of a C-H bond. Orders of reaction [ I I J suggest that the surface is almost fully 253 20 40 SO 60 70 E/kJ mol' Fig. 4. Compensation effect for cyclopropane hydrogenation (O) and hydrogenolysis (A) on NVSi02 catalysts of various dispersions [ 25 ]. covered by H atoms, with rather low concentrations of hydrocarbon species. Of course, unsaturated species such as methylene and ethene will readily be hydrogenated to the corresponding alkane under the experimental conditions. There are two other pieces of information which may help to confirm the proposed motivation for forming methane + ethane and to distinguish between alternative mechanisms. Let us consider first the hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopropane: steps analogous to that in Scheme 213, C and D could lead either to methane + propane or to two ethanes, depending upon the point of attachment of the substituted cyclopropyl radical. In a comprehensive study of this reaction over Ir single crystals, Engstrom et al. [ 26 ] have observed only the former route on the (111) face, but both with equal probability on the reconstructed (110)-(1 x 2) face. There are clearly geometric factors at work, but evidently both modes of dissociation are possible. Finally, it has been suggested [28] that the Compensation Effect can provide a means of deciding whether reactions of this type involve parallel routes (i.e. two different intermediates on two different types of surface site) or alternative pathways (i.e. of a single intermediate on one type of site). The hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of cyclopropane on various Ni/Si02 catalysts [25] conforms to the second scenario, since all the pairs of E-IogA values lie on a single line (Fig. 4). It would however be unsafe to extend this conclusion to Ru catalysts without further experimentation, since the quality of many of the published kinetics ( 7 ] is unfortunately insufficient to make further extension of this analysis rewarding at the present time.

Reactions of cyclopropane and of ethane with hydrogen on ruthenium/titania catalysts; reaction mechanisms Geoffrey C. Bond Rosiyah Yahya Department of Chemistry, Brunel University, Uxbridge UB8 3PH U.K. The hydrogenation of cyclopropane to propane is accompanied by hydrogenolysis to equimolar amounts of methane and ethane on a Ru/TiO2 catalyst pretreated both by high- and low-temperature reduction (HTR or LTR). The rate after oxidation and LTR is much faster than after a second HTR, when (due to the absence of Cl−) the catalyst enters the SMSI state. Even more marked variations of rate with pretreatment are found with ethane. Cleavage of the second CC bond in cyclopropane is detectable just above room temperature, where the (extrapolated) rates for propane and ethane hydrogenolysis would be negligible. Previous proposals to account for this process are examined, and found wanting. The dissociation of cyclopropane into adsorbed methylene and ethene is thought to be a more plausible route to the hydrogenolysis products. References 1 a G.C. Bond Yide Xu J. Chem.
