The dopants such as boron, nitrogen, phosphorous, and sulfur are essential for graphene quantum dots (GQDs) performance in ORR/OER process. Nevertheless, the accurate descriptions of dopant effects are still largely missing for GQDs catalyst. In this work, a relation is established between the intrinsic properties of dopants and the performance of GQDs as bi-functional catalyst in ORR/OER. The dopants break down the pi-electron network and induce spin fluctuation. It is found that the adsorption strength of key oxygen intermediates (O*, OH*, and OOH*) is well correlated with intrinsic bond strength index (IBSI). The detailed free energy pathways for both ORR and OER are presented for various doped GQDs which is used to identify the rate-limiting step and overpotential. It was proposed that pyridine nitrogen is the best dopant which yields lowest overpotential. In the end, a reactivity map is provided which enables a rational design of GQDs catalyst. Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract . With rapid economic development and population growth, sustainable energy has become an important issue to guarantee globally prosperous. Especially in the perspective of gradual reduction of traditional fossil energy reserves, new green and sustainable energy, such as solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, etc., has been paid more attentions [1]. Because of the intermittent, seasonal and regional characteristics of these energies, energy storage has become the key issue of efficient utilization. The development of cost-effective materials and technique, become the grand challenge of new energy storage device [2, 3]. The oxygen reduction reaction, (ORR) and its reverse reaction, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the key process during energy storage and electrochemistry conversion. Both of them are at the center of many applications including polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), direct-solar and electrolytic water-splitting devices, and metal-air batteries [4], which can be used to generate power for probes, satellites and space capsules and can be also considered as promising power solutions for future electric vehicles and portable electronic devices and so on [5]. However, the conventional ORR/OER catalysts are mainly noble-metal [6] based materials which limited the wide applications. Among various nanostructured carbon materials [7–10], graphene quantum dots[11, 12] appeared to be an excellent ORR/OER bifunctional electrochemical catalyst due to its intrinsic properties [13]. On the other hand, it is noted that doping with heteroatom (N, B, P, F, and S) [14–18] is a guarantee of the catalytic performance [19, 20] for nanostructured carbon materials. Although significant progress has been made [17], the ORR/OER bifunctional reaction mechanism of heteroatom-doped GQDs is still a matter of debate [21–24] which impeded the rational optimization. In particularly, the role of dopant is still remaining elusive. The relation between kind and configuration of dopant with the catalytic performance is largely missing. Aiming to fill gap between current understanding of mechanism and observed catalytic performance, first principles calculations are performed to reveal the catalytic role of dopant and the reaction pathway of ORR/OER. Various most often observed configurations and kinds of dopants including nitrogen, boron, phosphorous, and sulfur are investigated at the same footing. The subtle effects induced by doping are carefully examined which has direct influence on the adsorption strength of oxygen species in reaction. The nature of interaction of key intermediates (O*, OH*, and OOH*) with active site are revealed from electron topology analysis and intrinsic bond strength index (IBSI) [25]. The complete reaction pathway of ORR/OER are constructed which indicate the step with largest free energy change and overpotential. A reactivity map is depicted which is useful to guide the doped GQDs catalyst with lower overpotential. Overall, the current work lay out a solid basis for the further development of GQDs in electrochemistry process. The diverse configurations and local environments of dopants hinder the revealing of the intrinsic properties of dopants and their role to adjust ORR/OER performance of GQDs. As first step along the direction to entangle this remaining issue, several different configurations of dopants are included in current work as shown in Fig. 1. For nitrogen, four configurations were under investigations which are graphitic, pyrrolic, pyridine, and pyridine saturated with hydrogen respectively. It is noted that either bare nitrogen or saturated with hydrogen in pyridine configurations have been reported in literature. Hence, both of them were included. On the other hand, pyridine configuration was adopted for boron, sulfur, and phosphorous in order to distinguish the difference between dopants. The calculated bond distance between carbon and dopant were listed in Table S1. It was indicated that boron and graphitic nitrogen has the similar bond distance with the pristine GQDs which is 1.42 Å and 1.40 Å respectively. The pyrrolic and pyridine nitrogen dopants have shorter bond distance which is below 1.40 Å. On the other hand, sulfur and phosphorus have a bond distance of 1.75 Å, and 1.74 Å respectively. The introduction of dopants also breaks down the patterned pi electron distribution as shown in Figure S1. The induced effect on electronic structure was also observed from density of states analysis as shown in Figure S2. The new bands appeared in gap after doping. The charge transfer was witnessed between dopant and neighboring carbons. It was found that graphitic, pyrrolic, and pyridine nitrogen were charged with −0.29 e, 0.23 e, 0.00 e and 0.34 e. On the other hand, boron, sulfur, and phosphorous charged with 0.13 e, −0.21 e, −0.16 e respectively from NBO analysis. O*, OH*, and OOH* (asterisk indicates adsorption on GQDs) are the key intermediates during ORR/OER process. The optimized structures of adsorbed oxygen species are shown in Figure S3. The interactions between these oxygen species and GQDs have pivotal importance. The calculated binding energies of O*, OH*, and OOH* are shown in Fig. 2 a. There is a trend that the decreasing binding energies along O*, OH*, and OOH* for all investigated sites. The trend is consistent with LUMO_HOMO gap of these oxygen species as shown in Table S3. Moreover, the binding energies of oxygen species have a linear correlation with intrinsic bond strength index (IBSI) as shown in Fig. 2b. IBSI is an indicator of bond strength based on independent gradient model. It was noted that IBSI of investigated bonds is well above 0.3 which indicated that the nature of bonding is covalent. This identification is also supported from electron topology analysis as shown in Table S4. The calculated free energy diagrams of ORR/OER were shown in Fig 3 . The investigation of ORR reaction pathway indicated that the rate-determining step (RDS), which has the largest free energy change, on g-N, pyo-N, H-pyd-N, pyd-B and pyd-S was determined to be desorption of OH Eq. (4) from SI in supporting information). On the other hand, it was found that formation of *OH Eq. (3) is the RDS for pyd-P and C54. The calculated overpotential has been shown in Figure S4 and Table S4. It is interesting to observe that not all dopants are useful to reduce overpotential. The g-N, pyo-N, pyd-P, pyd-B and pyd-S have bigger overpotential than pristine GQDs. There is an exception which was found for pyd-N as shown in Fig. 3c. First of all, both largest free energy change and overpotential were much smaller than the other doped and pristine GQDs which revealed the better performance of pyridine nitrogen. Moreover, RDS at pyd-N was determined to be the formation of *OOH Eq. (1). OER is the reverse process of ORR. It was found that the RDS at g-N, pyo-N, H-pyd-N, pyd-B, and pyd-S is the desorption of OOH Eq. (8) for OER. On the other hand, RDS at pyd-P and C54 were the formation *OOH for OER Eq. (7). The most dopants had better performance than pristine GQDs except pyd-B and pyd-P regarding of overpotential. Again, pyd-N exhibited the best performance which is consistent with the observation of ORR. Based on the calculated overpotential, it is suggested that pyridine nitrogen is best dopant candidate for GQDs as bifunctional ORR/OER catalyst. Moreover, the strategy of doping has a better performance for OER than ORR. The RDS or overpotential are largely related with the binding strength of key oxygen intermediate. For example, it was found that adsorption of *OOH is endothermic except pyd-N, which means that it is difficult for pyd-N to bind *OOH. This observation is explained why the formation of *OOH become ORR limit step for pyd-N. For H-pyd -N, pyd-S and g-N have same RDS, which is *OH desorption or *OOH desorption for ORR and OER respectively. The difficulties associated with desorption were attributed to the strong bonding between oxygen and doped GQDs as shown in Fig. 2. The correlation between binding strength of oxygen species and activity prompted us to perform further explorations. Firstly, a linear relation was established between GOOH and GOH as shown in Figure S5. Moreover, a reactivity map was constructed under this relation as shown in Fig. 4 . All investigated doped GQDs fitted well with the activities calibrated by overpotential. It is clearly indicated that the adjustment of binding strength of oxygen species will directly influence the performance of GQDs in ORR/OER. Moreover, RDS was indicated under different free energy region which provided deeper insight to finely tune the catalytic properties. It is also noted that the center of map, best activity region, is still vacant which call for the novel combination of dopant and GQDs. In this work, the pronounced effects induced by N, B, S, and P dopants on GQDs are carefully examined to reveal the relation between intrinsic properties of catalyst and ORR/OER performance. The introduction of dopants significantly perturbed the electronic structure which created the active sites to bind oxygen intermediates. The adsorption strength is well correlated with IBIS index and the nature of interaction is of covalent. The rate-limiting step and overpotential are obtained from analysis of reaction pathway of both ORR and OER. It was indicated that pyridine nitrogen is predicted to be best dopant of GQDs in ORR/OER. The reactivity description of doped GQDs is supplied which give a roadmap for rational design of highly effective bi-functional ORR/OER catalysts. The current work provided a guideline for GQDs catalysts and established a frame for the dopants screening. CRediT authorship contribution statement Min Yang: Writing – original draft, Investigation.

Nevertheless, the accurate descriptions of dopant effects are still largely missing for GQDs catalyst. In this work, a relation is established between the intrinsic properties of dopants and the performance of GQDs as bi-functional catalyst in ORR/OER. The dopants break down the pi-electron network and induce spin fluctuation. It is found that the adsorption strength of key oxygen intermediates (O*, OH*, and OOH*) is well correlated with intrinsic bond strength index (IBSI). The detailed free energy pathways for both ORR and OER are presented for various doped GQDs which is used to identify the rate-limiting step and overpotential. It was proposed that pyridine nitrogen is the best dopant which yields lowest overpotential. In the end, a reactivity map is provided which enables a rational design of GQDs catalyst.",
