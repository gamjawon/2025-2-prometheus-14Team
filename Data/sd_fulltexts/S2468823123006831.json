Vanadium based battery is considered one of the most promising candidates to overcome the limitations of lithium ion battery in large-scale energy storage systems. However, the high manufacturing cost of the vanadium electrolyte has been hindered to commercialize. Although the catalytic production of vanadium electrolyte was reported, with an organic reducing agent such as formic acid is considered as a promising method, the continuous production of vanadium electrolyte is still difficult owing to the limited catalyst durability. Herein, we present the highly durable and active intermetallic Pt-alloyed catalysts, i.e., L12-Fe0.25Pt0.75/C and L12 Co0.25Pt0.75/C, for the catalytic production of V3.5+ electrolyte. In the catalytic test of electrolyte production, the intermetallic L12-Fe0.25Pt0.75/C showed nearly 3 times higher activity than the commercial Pt/C catalyst. In the catalyst durability test, on the other hand, the intermetallic L12 Co0.25Pt0.75/C showed only 3 % decrease of initial activity whereas the intermetallic L12-Fe0.25Pt0.75/C and commercial Pt/C exhibited ca. 9 % and ca. 20 % decrease of initial activity, respectively, for one hundred times continuous electrolyte production test. Among the catalysts tested, the intermetallic L12-Fe0.25Pt0.75/C showed the highest initial catalytic activity while the L12 Co0.25Pt0.75/C exhibited the strongest catalyst durability. In terms of catalytic activity and stability, the intermetallic L12 Co0.25Pt0.75/C was found to be an efficient catalyst for the practical production of V3.5+ electrolyte.

Introduction The development of renewable clean energy system is essential to solve environmental problems. Among various renewable energy applications from the clean energy sources, electrochemical energy storage (EES) system has received much attention because this technology is not only capable of storing energy but also capable of converting electrical energy from a power grid [1–5]. Hence, the EES can also be applied for electrical vehicle (EV) charging stations. Due to the increase of the EV market, the EV batteries have been rapidly developed to cover long distance range [6]. Moreover, there is a growing demand for fast charging stations in the EV industry. The ultra-fast charging system is capable of providing power levels higher than 300 kW. However, managing such power levels with only the grid network is hardly sufficient [7,8]. Therefore, EES is required as a distribution power system for a faster charging. There are various types of EES such as intermittent nature energies of wind, solar power, batteries, fuel cells, and super capacitors. Among these EES technologies, vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) is the most promising candidate for large scale EES system owing to its high safety, durable efficiency, and flexible design. Moreover, VRFBs can be installed in a fast charging station within a metropolitan area because VRFBs are safely operated due to their nonflammable and water-based electrolyte nature [1,4,5,9]. To achieve the practicability of VRFBs for the high power and durable EES, the constituent components such as membrane [10–12], electrode [13,14], bipolar plates [15], and electrolyte [16–21] must be optimized. In particular, vanadium electrolyte is one of the important factors determining the efficiency of VRFBs, but it comprises high portion of VRFBs system cost. Thus, high cost of electrolyte is the main hurdle to realize the commercialization of VRFBs. To overcome this obstacle, a facile and cost-effective production method of vanadium electrolyte must be developed. The V3.5+ electrolyte composed of equimolar amount of V3+ and V4+ is commonly used in the VRFBs industry, because it can be applied to both electrodes at the same time [9]. During the pre-charging process of VRFBs, V3.5+ is converted to V3+ and V4+ at the anode and cathode, respectively. Consequently, V2+ and V5+ are formed at the anode and cathode, respectively, after full charging of VRFBs. The V3.5+ electrolyte can be obtained by a 2-step reduction process. In the first step, V4+ is formed by the reduction of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5). In the second step, V4+ electrolyte is further reduced to V3.5+. The reduction from V2O5 to V4+ is done by a simple reduction process using an organic reducing agent (ORA) such as oxalic acid. On the other hand, it is very difficult to obtain V3.5+ by direct reduction of V4+ using the ORA. To solve this problem, various methods utilizing VRFB stack, water splitting or transition metals have been developed for the practical production of V3.5+ electrolyte [9,16–20]. However, these methods have several problems. At first, in the case of the utilization of VRFB stack, V3.5+ can be easily produced at the anode by the definite charging current of VRFB, but excess V4.5+ electrolyte is produced at the cathode simultaneously. At second, the electrolysis of the water splitting reaction can produce the V3.5+ electrolyte without a surplus V4.5+ because V4+ electrolyte is only introduced to the anode. However, water splitting based on the electrochemical reaction can cause vanadium ion cross-over phenomenon, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and carbon corrosion problem, and therefore, this technique requires exquisite operating conditions [19]. At third, chemical reaction methods utilizing V2O3, strong reducing agent, and adequate calcination process have been developed for a simple preparation of V3.5+ electrolyte [22,23]. However, these methods are also limited for the practical production of V3.5+ electrolyte because of high cost, low dissolution rate of V2O3, and complex process. Recently, Heo et al. have disclosed a noticeable invention for the production of impurity-free V3.5+ electrolyte by using platinum on carbon (Pt/C) catalyst in the presence of formic acid as a ORA [9]. This study shows that the reduction speed of V4+ to V3+ with formic acid can be accelerated by using Pt/C catalyst. The Pt/C is a well-known active catalyst used for reactions in the organic fuel cell applications such as direct formic acid fuel cell and direct methanol fuel cell. In the similar manner, formic acid can be easily oxidized by Pt/C, and the generated electrons participate in the reduction of V4+ to V3+. This process is known to be promising method to produce impurity-free V3.5+ electrolyte by the fact that the reaction mechanism only involves the evolution of CO2 and water. Although this invention opens the possibility of practical mass production of V3.5+ electrolyte, the durability of Pt/C catalyst still remains to be solved. The Pt/C is easily poisoned by carbon monoxide (CO) which is commonly formed as a reaction intermediate during the oxidization of formic acid. Consequently, the active sites of platinum (Pt) are gradually decreased and the continuous and long-term production of V3.5+ electrolyte can be limited in the presence of CO [24–26]. To solve the CO poisoning problem, various Pt-based catalysts alloyed with precious metal or transition metal have been studied for the development of highly durable catalysts. Pt-Ru, Pt-Pb, and Pt-Bi alloy catalysts are typical examples showing the enhanced CO tolerance [27–29]. The addition of alloying transition metals such as Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Cr, and Mn to Pt has also increased the CO tolerance [30]. These catalytic properties are due to the reduced adsorption energy of CO by tuning the electronic structure between Pt and second metal. Hence, the alloy composition and atom arrangement are important factors for the development of durable alloy catalysts. Although these Pt-alloyed catalysts have an advantage in the terms of CO tolerance, the production of V3.5+ electrolyte is not still perfect. This is because vanadium electrolytes normally contain sulfuric acid whose concentration is higher than 2 M in the electrolyte. This can cause metal leaching from the alloyed catalysts under high acidic condition. Among various Pt-based catalysts, the ordered intermetallic alloy catalyst is superior to the randomly positioned alloyed metal in terms of catalytic activity, resistance to CO poisoning, durability, and resistance to metal leaching, because the intermetallic phase with ordered arrangement of atoms within a structure provides excellent electronic effects. The intermetallic Fe0.25Pt0.75 and Co0.25Pt0.75 with L12 type-face centered cubic (fcc) structure exhibit 2–25 times higher activity than the commercial Pt/C in the oxygen reduction reaction [27,31–33]. Moreover, the Pt-rich intermetallic catalysts prevent the leaching problem of second metal because these catalysts have a thin Pt skin layer (0.5 nm) at the outermost particle, leading to the superior durability [34–38]. In this work, we present a mass and continuous production method of V3.5+ electrolyte by applying the highly active and durable ordered intermetallic Fe0.25Pt0.75/C (donated as L12-FePt/C) and Co0.25Pt0.75/C (donated as L12 CoPt/C) alloy catalysts with thin Pt skin layer. In the production of V3.5+ electrolyte, the intermetallic L12-FePt/C and L12 CoPt/C catalysts showed 5–10 times higher production activity than the commercial Pt/C. In the continuous V3.5+ electrolyte production tests for 100 times, furthermore, the decrease ratio of catalytic activity of L12 CoPt/C was only 3 % whereas that of the commercial Pt/C was ca. 20 %. Experimental Synthesis of N-carbon 2 g of carbon black (CABOT) and 3 g of urea (Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed for 30 min, and the mixture was carbonized at 150 °C for 2 h followed by annealing up to 300 °C for 2 h. The thermal treatment was carried out in a N2 atmosphere. After the thermal treatment in the furnace, the solid sample was dispersed in a mixture of 200 ml of water and 200 ml of ethanol, and then it was stirred for 2 h to remove the residue on the carbon surface. After filtering and washing with a mixture of water and ethanol, the nitrogen containing carbon (N-carbon) was evacuated for drying at 50 °C overnight [38]. Preparation of intermetallic Pt-alloyed catalysts (L12-FePt/C and L12 CoPt/C), Pt/N-carbon, and randomly oriented Pt-alloyed catalysts (CoPt3/C and FePt3/C) To prepare the carbon supported intermetallic Co0.25Pt0.75/C alloy catalyst, the precursor solution was prepared by adding 3.1 ml of H2PtCl6·6H2O (8 wt% in H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.05 g of CoCl2·6H2O (98 %, Daejung) into 50 ml of ethanol. 0.5 g of N-carbon was then added into the precursor solution and the mixture was sonicated for 10 min. The mixture was stirred at 70 °C until full evaporation, and then it was vacuum-dried at 50 °C for 12 h. The dried sample was further heated up to 150 °C for 3 h in a mixed stream of N2 (190 sccm) and H2 (10 sccm). The resultant was finally annealed up to 700 °C for 3.5 h in a H2 (100 sccm) atmosphere to obtain Co0.25Pt0.75/C alloy catalyst (donated as L12 CoPt/C). The preparation procedures of Fe0.25Pt0.75/C alloy catalyst (donated as L12-FePt/C) were almost identical to those of L12 CoPt/C alloy catalyst except that FeCl3·6H2O (98 %, Sigma-Aldrich) was used instead of CoCl2·6H2O (98 %, Daejung). To verify the N-carbon effects and ordered intermetallic phase, Pt/NCarbon (donated as Pt/NC), randomly oriented Co0.25Pt0.75/C, (donated as ROA-CoPt/C) and Fe0.25Pt0.75/C (donated as ORA-FePt/C) alloy catalysts were prepared by same synthetic method of ordered intermetallic catalysts, except the final reduction annealing was carried out at 400 °C. Preparation of V4+ electrolyte To prepare the electrolyte, 0.85 M V2O5 flake (98 %, GS eco-metal) and 0.85 M oxalic acid (99 %, Samchun) were dissolved in 4.1 M H2SO4 solution (98 %, Daejung). The solution was then vigorously mixed at 80 °C for 6 h. The resulting solution was filtered to remove the residual V2O5 flake, and the V4+ electrolyte with blue color was finally obtained. Catalytic production of V3.5+ electrolyte 100 ml of V4+ electrolyte and 0.6 g of each intermetallic catalyst or commercial Pt/C (Alfa Aesar 40 wt%) were put into a 200 ml bottle, and it was then heated up to 80 °C. At the target temperature, 1.71 ml of formic acid (99 %, Daejung) was added successively into the mixture in the bottle with vigorous stirring. After the reaction was completed, the V3.5+ electrolyte was filtered using a filter paper. The filtered catalyst powder was dried at 50 °C overnight. Characterization of catalysts and electrolytes The prepared catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical, EMPYREAN), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Sigma Probe, Thermo VG Scientific), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEM 3010, Jeol) analyses. The XRD patterns were obtained using Panalytical Empyrean within 10°−90° at 40 kV with a scan rate of 0.1683° s−1. XPS measurements were done by using a Thermo VG Scientific with Al Kα radiation of 1486.7 eV. To characterize the intermetallic catalyst structure, the electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) image and line scan were performed using a high resolution TEM (HR-TEM, JEM-2200FS, JEOL). The atomic ratio and composition of Pt, Co, and Fe in the intermetallic catalysts were analyzed by an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-AES, PerkinElmer Optima 8300). The V3.5+ electrolytes, produced by the catalysts, were analyzed by UV–vis spectroscopy and ion chromatography (IC). The UV–vis spectra were taken by Shimadzu UV 2450 Spectrometer to confirm the oxidation states of the electrolytes. In order to check the presence of residual formic acid in the V3.5+ electrolytes, the IC (Metrohm 850 Professional) analyses were carried out. For the IC analyses, each electrolyte was diluted by a factor of 40 with deionized water. The vanadium oxidation state in the electrolytes was calculated by using a Potentiometirc titrator (904 Titrando) including Pt Titrode (Metrohm), and KMnO4 (Aldrich) as titration chemical and auto-injector. The 0.1 ml of electrolyte samples after conversion and durability tests were mixed with 80 ml of deionized water and then the sample beaker was placed into the titration autosampler. To measure the potential of the electrolyte during the changing oxidation states, a Pt electrode and KMnO4 auto-injector were put in the sample beaker. The calculation of vanadium concentration and oxidation states was automatically performed by the Tiamo program with the following equations. Concentration of Vanadium ( mol L ) = 5 X concentration of KMnO 4 ( mol L ) × Volume of KMnO 4 ( ml ) Vanadium electrolyte Sample Size ( mL ) Concentration of Vanadium ( mol L ) = 5 X concentration of KMnO 4 ( mol L ) × Volume of KMnO 4 ( ml ) Vanadium electrolyte Sample Size ( mL ) Electrochemical half-cell test To evaluate the half-cell electrical performances of catalysts, the catalytic ink was prepared by dispersing 8 mg of catalysts in a mixture of 5 mL of ultrapure water, 0.8 mL of 2-propanol, and 20 μL of a 5% w/w alcoholic solution of Nafion (Aldrich). Then, catalyst ink was sonicated for 10 min for dispersion. To obtain the 50 μg / cm−2 of the catalyst on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE), the prepared catalyst inks of 30 μL was dropped onto the electrode surface with 6 mm diameter and then dried under ambient atmosphere. To minimize the blockage of active sites of catalysts surface by bubbles formed during the test, the catalyst-coated GCEs were rotated at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The electrochemical performance of commercial Pt/C (Pt 40 wt%, Alfa asear, Hispec 4000) and intermetallic Pt based alloy/C for formic acid (FA) oxidation was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) was conducted for commercial Pt/C, intermetallic L12 CoPt/C and L12-FePt/C toward oxidation activity of FA in the 0.5 M FA and 0.1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution within voltage range from −0.2 to 1.4 V (vs Ag/AgCl). In addition, to verify the electrochemical activity of N-carbon support effects, a Pt/NC catalyst (Pt 40 wt%) was prepared and also LSV tested under the same condition. The catalysts mass activity was confirmed by based on the LSV results with the loading of entire catalysts (50 μg cm–2) on the GCE. The catalysts durability test of commercial Pt/C, L12 CoPt/C and L12-FePt/C was performed by chronoamperometry (CA) and using the rotating-disk electrode at 2000 rpm and 0.45 V (vs Ag/AgCl). Catalytic durable performance of formic acid oxidation was investigated for 1800 s. CO stripping voltammogram was carried out with commercial Pt/C, L12 CoPt/C and L12-FePt/C. CO stripping voltammograms curves were obtained before and after CO gas (99.9 %) bubbling for 30 min in 0.1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution at 10 mV s–1 within the range from −0.2 to 0.1 V (vs Ag/AgCl). Results and discussion Characteristics of intermetallic L12-FePt/C and L12 CoPt/C catalysts The nitrogen-containing carbon (N-carbon) used for the preparation of L12-FePt/C and L12 CoPt/C was prepared by a soft-nitriding method for the generation of nitrogen species onto carbon surface through mild thermal decomposition of urea at 300 °C. N-carbon can provide not only high affinity between metal precursors and carbon support by electrostatic interaction but also fine distribution of metal particles. To prepare the carbon supported intermetallic catalysts, known amounts of Fe (FeCl3·6H2O), Co (CoCl2·6H2O), and Pt (H2PtCl6·6H2O) precursors were mixed with N-carbon support in a solvent. Subsequently, the mixture was stirred and dried at 70 °C. To obtain the ordered intermetallic phase with a thin Pt layer, the dried mixture powder was reduced by a mixed stream of H2 and N2. Finally, L12-FePt/C and L12 CoPt/C with Pt skin layer were obtained (Scheme 1 ). The intermetallic L12-FePt/C and L12 CoPt/C were prepared by the thermal annealing at 700 °C from the randomly oriented FePt/C (ROA-FePt/C) and CoPt/C (ROA-CoPt/C), respectively. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra exhibited the obvious oxidation state changes of Pt by the intermetallic transformation (Figs. 1 and S1). Both intermetallic L12-FePt/C and L12 CoPt/C exhibited doublet peaks at 75.2 eV and 71.5 eV corresponding to Pt 4f5/2 and Pt 4f7/2 for Pt0 metal, respectively, whereas the disordered ROA-CoPt/C and ROA-FePt /C and commercial Pt/C represented the peaks at 74.6 eV and 70.9 eV. This positive binding energy shift for Pt 4f, by intermetallic transformation, was resulted from the spontaneous electron transfers between Pt and Co or Fe atoms in the L12 CoPt/C and L12-FePt/C. On the other hands, two peaks at 76.3 eV and 72.8 eV, attributing to Pt 4f5/2 and Pt 4f7/2 for Pt2+ were identically observed for all samples due to the natural oxidation during the storage. For further confirmation of the ordered intermetallic phase, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed. Four XRD peaks of commercial Pt/C corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes were matched with the pure Pt metal as shown in Fig. 2 (a). The intermetallic phase of L10-Fe0.25Pt0.75/C and L10 Co0.25Pt0.75/C also showed a typical Pt fcc structure. However, the diffraction peaks of these two intermetallic alloy catalysts appeared at higher angles than those of the commercial Pt/C, indicating that Pt lattice experienced contraction during the formation of alloy phase owing to the incorporation of Fe and Co atoms into the Pt lattice. The ordered intermetallic phase was confirmed by two distinctive (100) and (110) diffraction peaks which were not observed in the randomly oriented alloy and pure Pt metal phases as shown in Figs. 2 and S2. The XRD patterns of L12-Fe0.25Pt0.75/C and L12-Co0.25Pt0.75/C were matched with the standard fcc-Fe1: Pt3 (CICSD No. 98–005–6275) and fcc-Co1: Pt3 (CIDD No. 98–010–2624). The average crystallite sizes of L10-Fe0.25Pt0.75 and L10 Co0.25Pt0.75/C calculated by the Scherrer equation on (111) plane were found to be 9 nm and 12 nm, respectively. To confirm the metal loading on the carbon in the L12-FePt/C and L12 CoPt/C, a thermogravimetric analysis was performed under an air atmosphere. The weight of both intermetallic catalysts was dramatically reduced between 300 °C and 400 °C as shown in Fig. 2(b). The final residual weight of two intermtallic catalysts was about 37–38 %, which was similar to the target loading (40 wt%) of metals. TEM images in Fig. 3 (a) and (d) clearly showed the L12-Fe0.25Pt0.75 and L12 Co0.25Pt0.75 nanoparticles on the carbon support with a size of ca. 9 ± 1.3 nm and 11.4 ± 2.2 nm, respectively, well consistent with the XRD results (Fig. 2(a)). Although homogenously distributed nanoparticles on the carbon support were not formed, intermetallic nanoparticles were successfully prepared without severe particle aggregation by a soft nitriding method [38]. The N species in the carbon support not only provides high affinity between metal precursors and carbon support but also prevents aggregation of metal particles even at high metal loading on the carbon support. The high resolution TEM (HR-TEM) analysis was performed to confirm the intermetallic L12 phase of FePt and CoPt nanocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 3(c) and (f), the D-spacings (0.22 nm and 0.27 nm) correspond to the (111) and (110) planes of the intermetallic L12-FePt and L12 CoPt structures. To further observe the N-carbon effects, additional Pt/N-carbon was prepared by the soft nitriding method and the particle size distribution of commercial Pt/C, Pt/NC, L12 CoPt/C, and L12-FePt/C was confirmed by TEM analysis (Fig. S3). The average particle size of Pt/NC is 1.5 ± 0.5 nm. Pt particles are well distributed on the N-doped carbon. The particle size of commercial Pt/C is 3 ± 1 nm. When particle size of these two catalysts is compared, Pt/NC is slightly smaller than commercial Pt/C. The formation of smaller nanoparticles is attributed the N-doped effect in the soft nitriding method [38]. Pt particles are also smaller than intermetallic nanoparticles (9 ∼ 11 nm) as shown in Fig. S4. Pt/NC was synthesized at a lower reducing heat-treatment temperature at 400 °C, resulting in the formation of smaller nanoparticles. On the other hand, intermetallic catalysts were synthesized at 700 °C to obtain the ordered intermetallic phase. Consequently, the particle size was significantly affected by not only the N-doped effect but also the reductive heat treatment temperature. The electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) elemental mapping and line scanning analyses of a single nanoparticle are presented in Fig. 4 . The EELS electron mapping images of the L12-FePt (Fig. 4(a)–(c)) and L12 CoPt nanoparticle (Fig. 4(e)–(g)) showed that Fe, Co, and Pt were homogeneously distributed within the nanoparticle. As shown in Fig. 4(d) and (h), the line scanning analysis showed that a thin Pt layer was formed on both the L12-FePt and L12 CoPt surface. To further confirm the formation of core-shell structure, randomly oriented alloy CoPt3/C (ROA-CoPt3/C) and FePt3/C (ROA-FePt3/C) were prepared and conducted by the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) line mapping. As shown in Fig. S5(c) and S5(f), ROA-CoPt3/C and FePt3/C (ROA-FePt3/C) were not formed as the core-shell structure because randomly oriented alloy CoPt3/C and FePt3/C nanoparticles were treated by somewhat low reduction annealing process (400 °C). The formation of core-shell structure of Pt-based alloy nanoparticles requires high annealing temperature over 600 °C that leads to Pt segregation at the particle surface and formation of Pt thin layer on the surface [39,40]. It is noteworthy that L12-FePt and L12 CoPt had an ordered intermetallic phase consisting of a core and a thin Pt layer (0.6 nm) in a shell structure. Because the V3.5+ electrolyte is produced in a highly concentrated of H2SO4 solution, the Pt skin layer plays a very important role in preventing the metal leaching under strong acidic condition. In other words, the ordered intermetallic L12-FePt and L12 CoPt with the core/shell structure may show the high catalyst stability during the electrolyte production. Electrochemical performance of L12-FePt/C and L12 CoPt/C The catalytic activity and stability of intermetallic catalysts for the oxidation of formic acid (FA) were investigated by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) test. Fig. 5 (a) shows the linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) of the commercial Pt/C, L12-FePt/C, and L12 CoPt/C for the FA oxidation in the 0.5 M formic acid and 0.1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution within the voltage range from −0.2 to 1.4 V (vs Ag/AgCl). The high catalytic activity can be evaluated by the high oxidation current. At 0.7 V, the peak currents of L12-FePt/C, L12 CoPt/C, and commercial Pt/C were 1.044, 0.588, and 0.314 mA, respectively. The ordered intermetallic L12-FePt/C and L12 CoPt/C showed higher FA oxidation activity than the commercial Pt/C. For further confirmation of NCarbon support effects, Pt/NC was evaluated by LSV under the same procedure and condition (Fig. S6). When comparing electrochemical activity, at 0.7 V, the peak current of commercial Pt/C and Pt/NC were 0.314 mA and 0.469 mA, respectively. This result indicates that the formation of nitrogen species such as NH3 and HCNO on the carbon surface by the soft nitriding method provides strong affinity between Pt (or intermetallic) metal and carbon supports therefore, Pt/NC exhibits higher electrical performance than that of commercial Pt/C for the formic acid oxidation [41–43]. However, as shown in Fig. 5(a), the peak current of Pt/NC at 0.7 V was lower than that of intermetallic L12-FePt/C (1.044 mA) and L12 CoPt (0.588 mA) catalysts, which means that chemically ordered intermetallic phase provides excellent electrochemical activity, even though intermetallic catalysts have larger particle size than that of Pt/NC. In addition, the onset potential of these catalysts further supported the FA oxidation activity as shown in Fig. 5(b). The onset potential of L12-FePt/C and L12 CoPt/C are confirmed at the 5 mA mg−2 metal where the onset of FA oxidation occurs [44–46]. The onset potentials of L12-FePt/C, L12 CoPt/C, and commercial Pt/C appeared at −0.019, −0.029, and −0.127 V, respectively. The significant increase in the catalytic activities of the intermetallic catalysts for the FA oxidation was mainly attributed to the chemically ordered intermetallic phase [27,44]. The catalyst durability towards the FA oxidation is closely related to the continuous production of V3.5+ electrolyte. In general, the oxidation reaction of FA involves direct and indirect pathways. The direct pathway is a direct oxidation of FA to CO2 at lower potential region. Conversely, the indirect reaction pathway generates the CO intermediate by FA dehydration at high potential region, resulting in the decrease of catalyst active sites due to CO poisoning [42]. Although FA is spontaneously oxidized by metal catalysts in this study, CO may be generated during the oxidation of FA. Thus, the catalyst durability for the FA oxidation was investigated. Chronoamperometry (CA) was performed to check the durability of the catalysts at 0.45 V (vs Ag/AgCl) as displayed in Fig. 5(c). The commercial Pt/C lost 43 % of current after 1800 s. The current decrease ratio of commercial Pt/C was much higher than that of the other catalysts. It is well known that the active sites of Pt decrease because the CO intermediate formed by the dehydration of FA is strongly adsorbed on the Pt surface [27,31,34,44,47]. The initial currents of L12-FePt/C and L12 CoP/C were found to be 1.267 and 1.130 mA, respectively. Although the L12-FePt/C exhibited higher initial catalytic activity than the L12 CoPt/C, the L12 CoPt/C showed the better stability than the L12-FePt/C. The current of L12-FePt/C exhibited 33 % of the initial value after 1800 s, whereas the current of L12 CoPt/C retained 81 % of its initial current under the same test conditions. These results imply that the ordered intermetallic catalysts showed much higher stability than the commercial Pt/C as expected. Furthermore, the L12 CoPt/C showed the better tolerance against CO poisoning than the L12-FePt/C. To support the CA results, we evaluated the CO stripping voltammograms of L12-FePt/C, L12 CoPt/C, and commercial Pt/C before and after CO gas bubbling in 0.1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution for 30 min, as shown in Fig. 5(d)–(f). For the commercial Pt/C, the H + adsorption peak within the range from −0.2 to 0.1 V (vs Ag/AgCl) was observed before CO bubbling. However, the sharp CO oxidation peak current (0.223 mA) appeared at 0.7 V after the introduction of CO gas. Moreover, the broad H + adsorption peak diminished to below 0.4 V, suggesting that Pt surface was totally covered with CO [44,47]. On the other hand, the L12-FePt/C showed the lower CO oxidation peak current (0.18 mA) than commercial Pt/C as shown in Fig. 5(e). In addition, the onset potential of CO oxidation of L12-FeP/C appeared at 0.5 V, which was more negative than that (0.61 V) of the commercial Pt/C (0.179 mA). The L12 CoPt/C showed the higher resistance against CO poisoning with a lower CO oxidation current (0.138 mA) and lower onset potential (0.48 V) than the other two catalysts. This indicates that L12 CoPt/C retained less CO adsorption ability and CO was readily oxidized to CO2, and thus, L12 CoP/C showed the higher CO tolerance than the other catalysts as demonstrated in Fig. 5(f). The improvement of catalytic activity and CO tolerance of L12-FeP/C and L12 CoPt/C can be explained by their ordered intermetallic structure. The incorporation of non-precious metal (M) into Pt induced the ordered arrangement of metal ions, tuning the physicochemical properties of Pt surface, for the enhanced catalytic activity. Furthermore, it is reported that M-Pt alloy resulted in highly enhanced CO tolerance owing to the downshifting of Pt D-band center, leading to the weak adsorption of CO species and the accelerative reaction of CO intermediates to CO2 [27]. Catalytic production of V3.5+ electrolyte To verify the possibility of the catalysts for the practical production of V3.5+ electrolyte, we performed the reduction reaction of V4+ to V3.5+ with three catalysts (Pt/C, L12-FePt/C, and L12 CoPt/C) using formic acid as the ORA. For the conversion tests, 60 mg of each catalyst was applied with formic acid (1/4 mol formic acid / 1 mol V4+ electrolyte) to the 10 ml of 1.7 M V4+ electrolyte at 80 °C. Fig. 6 (a) shows the conversion rates from V4+ to V3.5+ with three catalysts. The reaction time of L12-FePt/C, L12 CoPt/C, and commercial Pt/C were adjusted to be 1, 3, and 15 min. The catalytic performance was increased in the order of Pt/C < L12 CoPt/C < L12-FePt/C. To confirm the N-carbon effects, Pt/NC was also applied under same conversion test condition in the Fig. S7. The conversion reaction complete time of Pt-N/C from V4+ to V3.5+ was faster than that of commercial Pt/C (10 min). This result is due to the N-carbon effects. On the other hands, when comparing the intermetallic catalysts, Pt/NC showed lower conversion activity. The Fig. 6(a) shows that the conversion rate was closely related to the catalytic activity for FA oxidation. The result was well consistent with the catalytic activity of FA oxidation (Figs. 5(a) and S2). To elucidate the conversion reaction rate, the ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectra were taken for the three catalysts after 10 min of conversion reaction. As shown in Fig. 6(b), the commercial Pt/C exhibited higher and lower absorbances for V4+ (760 nm) and V3+ (401 nm) than the L12-FePt/C and L12 CoPt/C catalysts, suggesting that the commercial Pt/C showed the lower conversion rate than the other catalysts at the same reaction time. The catalyst durability in the production of V3.5+ electrolyte was checked by conducting the continuous conversion tests from V4+ to V3.5+ for 100 times. In the durability tests, the reduction time was kept at 15 min and the oxidation states were determined by the titration method. As shown in Fig. 6(c), three catalysts showed a stable catalytic performance during the first 30 repeated tests. However, the commercial Pt/C and L12-FePt/C showed a gradual decrease of catalytic performance after 40 repeated tests. The catalyst durability decreased in the order of L12 CoPt/C > L12-FePt/C > Pt/C. The drop in conversion ratio were 20 % and 9 % after 100 repeated tests for the commercial Pt/C and L12-FePt/C, respectively. On the other hand, only 3 % decrease in conversion ratio was observed for L12 CoPt/C. Although the L12-FePt/C showed higher initial catalytic activity than the L12 CoPt/C, the L12 CoPt/C exhibited better catalyst durability than the L12-FePt/C. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the intermetallic L12 CoPt/C was a more promising catalyst in terms of FA oxidation rate and CO tolerance. Conclusions The intermetallic L12 CoPt3/C and L12-FePt3/C catalysts were successfully prepared for use in the possible mass production of V3.5+ electrolyte. In the catalytic performance tests, these intermetallic catalysts showed superior oxidation activity for the formic acid oxidation (the main reaction to produce the V3.5+ electrolyte). The intermetallic L12-FePt/C and L12 CoPt/C catalysts showed nearly 2.5 times higher activity in the formic acid oxidation, and they exhibited about 5 times faster conversion time from V4+ to V3.5+ than the commercial Pt/C catalyst. In the repeated production tests of V3.5+ electrolyte, the decrease ratio of catalytic activity of intermetallic L12 CoPt/C catalyst was only 3 %, whereas that of the commercial Pt/C was ca. 20 % for 100 repeated electrolyte production tests. Although the L12-FePt/C exhibited higher activity than the L12 CoPt/C, the L12 CoPt/C showed better durability than the L12-FePt/C. The outstanding performance of the designed catalysts are attributed to the ordered intermetallic phase and Pt-rich core-shell structure. This work demonstrates that the intermetallic catalysts can be applied to the catalytic production of V3.5+ electrolyte in a more effective and stable way compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst.

        "dc:description": "Vanadium based battery is considered one of the most promising candidates to overcome the limitations of lithium ion battery in large-scale energy storage systems. However, the high manufacturing cost of the vanadium electrolyte has been hindered to commercialize. Although the catalytic production of vanadium electrolyte was reported, with an organic reducing agent such as formic acid is considered as a promising method, the continuous production of vanadium electrolyte is still difficult owing to the limited catalyst durability. Herein, we present the highly durable and active intermetallic Pt-alloyed catalysts, i.e., L12-Fe0.25Pt0.75/C and L12 Co0.25Pt0.75/C, for the catalytic production of V3.5+ electrolyte. In the catalytic test of electrolyte production, the intermetallic L12-Fe0.25Pt0.75/C showed nearly 3 times higher activity than the commercial Pt/C catalyst. In the catalyst durability test, on the other hand, the intermetallic L12 Co0.25Pt0.75/C showed only 3 % decrease of initial activity whereas the intermetallic L12-Fe0.25Pt0.75/C and commercial Pt/C exhibited ca. 9 % and ca. 20 % decrease of initial activity, respectively, for one hundred times continuous electrolyte production test. Among the catalysts tested, the intermetallic L12-Fe0.25Pt0.75/C showed the highest initial catalytic activity while the L12 Co0.25Pt0.75/C exhibited the strongest catalyst durability. In terms of catalytic activity and stability, the intermetallic L12 Co0.25Pt0.75/C was found to be an efficient catalyst for the practical production of V3.5+ electrolyte.",
