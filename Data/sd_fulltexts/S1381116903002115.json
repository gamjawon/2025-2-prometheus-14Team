A newer type of metal salt–metal ion exchanged Montmorillonite (Mont), MCl2-M n+-Mont (M=Ni, Cu, Zn; n=2) have been prepared and evaluated as solid acid catalysts for Friedel–Crafts reactions particularly for benzylation of benzene. The most efficient solid acid catalysts were found to be Zn-Mont containing composites. A newer type of metal salt–metal ion exchanged Montmorillonite (Mont), MCl2-M n+-Mont (M=Ni, Cu, Zn; n=2) have been prepared and evaluated as solid acid catalysts for Friedel–Crafts reactions particularly for benzylation of benzene. The activity of such composites depends upon the amount of loading of metal salts on the metal ion exchanged-Mont support and 1.5mmol loading per mole of the support shows the highest activity. Activation temperature of the composites also plays an important role and 150±10°C is the optimum region. ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont (1.5mmol, 0.926g) and Zn2+-Mont (1.5mmol, 3.33g) composites show about 97% conversion during 24h of reaction time and therefore, the former composite shows an advantage over the latter in respect of total amount of catalyst weight to be used. The composites show both Bronsted and Lewis acidities which were determined by thermal desorption and differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) techniques. The composites were also characterized by thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Keywords Activation temperature Thermal desorption Montmorillonite Solid acid catalyst 1 Introduction Supported inorganic reagents are rapidly emerging as a new and environmentally accepted materials for improving process efficiency or to replace environmentally unacceptable reagents and catalysts [1]. Synergistic effects between the support materials and the reagents can lead to unexpectedly high activity. Replacement of environmentally unacceptable anhydrous AlCl3, an efficient catalyst for Friedel–Crafts reactions, by metal salt supported K-10-Mont (acid treated) has been claimed [2–4]. Supported ZnCl2-K-10-Mont clay, known as “Clayzic”, is an important solid acid catalysts for certain Friedel–Crafts reactions despite the low activity of the individual component [5]. Exchange of interlayer Na+ of smectite (Mont) by high charge density cations such as Al+3, Zn+2, etc. leads to acidity as high as 10moldm−3. These highly acidic forms of Mont clay have been described as broad spectrum catalysts for organic synthesis [1,6]. Such clays at high temperature reduce to Lewis acidity through the loss of interlayer water. It, therefore, appears that suitable supported metal ion or metal salt on Mont clay may play a key role as solid acid catalysts. In the present work, a systematic study on the Friedel–Craft reaction, e.g. benzylation of benzene using anhydrous metal salts (ZnCl2, CuCl2 and NiCl2); metal exchange Mont (Zn2+-Mont, Cu2+-Mont and Ni2+-Mont) and metal salt supported on metal exchanged Mont (ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont, CuCl2-Cu2+-Mont and NiCl2-Ni2+-Mont) as solid acid catalysts have been carried out. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermal analysis. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and methods Mont clay collected from Crook County, Wyoming, USA (Swy-2) source clay minerals repository, contained silica sand, iron oxide, etc. as impurities and was purified by the sedimentation methods [7]. The <2μm fraction rich in Mont was collected. The oxide composition of the clay was SiO2: 58.12; Al2O3: 18.93; Fe2O3: 4.63; MgO: 2.52; CaO: 1.12; LOI: 13.54 and others 1.14%. The clay was converted to the homoionic Na-exchanged form (Na+-Mont) by stirring in 2M NaCl solution for about 78h, which was washed and finally dialyzed against distilled water until conductivity of the dialyzate approached that of distilled water. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the clay was determined [8] and found to be 90meq/100g of clay. 2.2 Preparation of dry metal chloride The dry metal chlorides were prepared by known SOCl2 reflux method [9]. 2.3 Preparation of cation-exchanged clay catalysts M n+-Mont (M n+=Cu2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+) was prepared by the treatment of 3g of Na+-Mont dispersed in 300ml of distilled water with slow addition of 3ml of 1M solution of CuCl2 or NiCl2 or ZnCl2. The slurry was set aside for a few hours and dialysed against distilled water till the test of chloride was found to be negative and the conductivity of the dialyzate approached that of distilled water. The samples were collected and dried at 80°C for 24h [10–12]. 2.4 Preparation of supported (1.5 mmol) metal salts-Mn+-Mont catalyst About 1mmol of M n+-Mont was dispersed in 100ml of water and stirred for about 2h. 1.5ml of 1M metal chloride solution was added slowly and stirred for about 12h. The slurry was dried in an oven at about 80°C. 2.5 Activation of the catalysts ZnCl2, Zn2+-Mont and ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont were activated under dry air at 120, 150 and 250°C for 8h. 2.6 Measurement of surface acidity (active acid sites) of the catalyst by ammonia adsorption method [13,14] The catalysts were thermally activated at 150°C under flowing nitrogen for 1h. Ammonia gas was then purged for 2h. The nature and strength of acidic sites were determined from the desorption of chemisorbed ammonia by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (TA instrument, Model STD 2960 simultaneous DTA–TGA) in the temperature range 150–700°C. The surface acidity was further substantiated by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) of ammonia presorbed activated samples using the equipment DSC/SDT-2960 M/S TA corporation, USA. 2.7 Basal spacing determination by XRD technique Basal spacing (d 001) of the samples were determined from the oriented sample prepared on glass slides by standard techniques [15]. XRD patterns of the samples heated at different temperatures were taken in the range 2θ=2–60° at a rate of 6°min−1 (X-ray Diffractometer Jeol, JDX-11P3A, Japan). 2.8 General procedure for the benzylation of benzene The reaction was carried out in a 25ml round bottom flask with CaCl2 guard tube. Dry benzyl chloride (1.25ml), 25ml of dry benzene and required amount of catalyst were taken into the flask. The substrate (benzyl chloride) to metal (content in catalysts Zn2+-Mont, ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont, etc.) was in 1:0.17mol ratio. The mixture was then stirred at room temperature by a magnetic stirrer at 300rpm. The reaction products were taken after 0.25, 0.75, 2, 5, 10, 18, 24, 48 and 72h interval of reaction and were analyzed by GC (Chemito GC, Model 8510, FID). 3 Results and discussions Preliminary studies on benzylation of benzene (Friedel–Crafts reaction) to produce diphenylmethane (Scheme 1 ) in presence of different solid acid catalysts like anhydrous metal salts MCl2, M n+-Mont and MCl2-M n+-Mont (M=Cu, Ni, Zn; n=2) reveal that Zn2+-Mont and ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont exhibit high catalytic activities (Fig. 1 ) and the rest show either low or negligible activities and therefore, detail study has been concentrated only on these two composites and further catalytic activities of Cu and Ni containing composites were not performed. The reason for such low activities is attributed to poor acidity of the composites. It is observed (Fig. 1) that during the initial period of the reaction the catalytic activity of ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont was very low which increased gradually and near 48h of reaction the catalytic activity became almost same as that of Zn2+-Mont composite. 3.1 Characterization of the composites 3.1.1 Thermal desorption and differential scanning calorimetric technique for overall acidity determination The desorption of adsorbed ammonia by Zn2+-Mont and ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont composites were studied by thermogravimetric analysis in the temperature range 25–700°C (TA Instrument, Model STD 2960 simultaneous DTA–TGA). From room temperature up to about 150°C (Fig. 2a ) the composites show almost no loss of mass (TG peaks) as the samples were generated at about 150°C. Above 150°C, two distinct peaks of TG are obtained for the NH3-Zn2+-Mont in the temperature range 200–380 and 450–650°C with corresponding mass loss of 1.62 and 5.19%. While Zn2+-Mont composite shows the corresponding mass loss of 1.40 and 3.20% (Fig. 2b). The DTA curve shows a broad exothermic peak in the same temperature range (Fig. 2a and b). The additional mass loss in NH3-Zn2+-Mont in the temperature regions, i.e. 200–380 and 450–650°C have been attributed to the desorption of ammonia from Bronsted and Lewis acid sites, respectively. Therefore, the amount of desorption of NH3 equivalent to Bronsted and Lewis acid sites were found to be 0.129 and 1.17mmolg−1 of the Zn2+-Mont composite. In case of ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont three distinct mass loss (Fig. 2c) of 4.2, 5.3 and 2.5% are observed in the temperature range 150–425, 425–620 and 640–700°C, respectively. While for NH3-ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont shows (Fig. 2d) two distinct mass loss of 4.7 and 8.3% for the temperature range 150–440 and 440–680°C, respectively. The loss of NH3 thus amounts to 0.647 and 1.705mmolg−1 for the Bronsted and Lewis acid sites, respectively. The DTA curves (Fig. 2c) show one very broad and strong and one weak peak in the range 150–635 and 640–700°C for the composite ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont. In case of NH3-ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont, the DTA curve shows (Fig. 2d) three endothermic peaks at 157, 300, and 495°C and two exothermic peaks at 230 and 428°C. Thus, it appears that the amount of Lewis acid sites is much higher than the Bronsted acid sites in both the composites, i.e. Zn2+-Mont and ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont, and the later composite show higher acid sites than the former. Therefore, it is likely that the ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont composite should show higher acid catalyst activity than the Zn2+-Mont composite. The differential scanning calorimetric thermograms of the different composites are shown in the Fig. 3 . The NH3-Zn2+-Mont shows (Fig. 3a) two exothermic broad peaks in the temperature range 160–410 and 415–540°C attribute to desorption of NH3 from the Bronsted and Lewis acid sites, respectively, while no such peaks are observed in case of Zn2+-Mont composite. Similarly, NH3-ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont exhibits (Fig. 3b) two distinct broad exothermic peaks in the temperature range 320–430 and 450–580°C indicating NH3 has been chemisorbed on the Bronsted and Lewis acid sites, respectively. The neat ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont (Fig. 3b) on the other hand shows no such peaks. These data corroborate the observations of TG/DTA studies. 3.1.2 X-ray diffraction studies The basal spacings (d 001) of the composites Zn2+-Mont and ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont are shown in Fig. 4 . It appears that at room temperature the d 001 value of Zn2+-Mont, i.e. 15.2Å decreases gradually and finally reaches a value of 10.28Å at about 250°C. Similarly, the ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont shows a gradual lowering of its basal spacing d 001 of 14.37Å (room temperature) to about 9.8Å at 250°C. Therefore, it has become obvious that the Zn2+-Mont composite heated at 150°C (optimum activation temperature) shows higher basal spacing (14.14Å) than that of ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont (12.6Å). Thus, it may suggest that the Zn2+-Mont composite is likely to act as more efficient solid acid catalysts than the ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont composite for organic reactions because of higher interlayer spacing. 3.1.3 Effect of ZnCl2 loading on the activity of catalyst The effect of loading of ZnCl2 on Zn2+-Mont support against the percentage yield of diphenylmethane is shown in Fig. 5 . It appears that at a loading of 0.5mmolg−1, the amount of conversion is negligible. On increasing the amount of loading, the conversion increases and reaches a maximum at about 1.5mmolg−1. Further increase of loading at 2.5mmolg−1, the rate of conversion decreases. Thus, the amount of loading of ZnCl2 on Zn2+-Mont plays an important role for acting as acid catalyst. 3.1.4 Effect of activation temperature on catalytic activity The effect of different activation temperature on the percentage yield of diphenylmethane using Zn2+-Mont and ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont catalyst are shown in Fig. 6 . It reveals that at activation temperature of 120°C the conversion were 58.52 and 30.30% for Zn2+-Mont and ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont, respectively and enhances to 95.0 and 91.51% on increasing activation temperature to about 150°C for a reaction time of 18h at room temperature. On increasing the temperature further up to 250°C the corresponding yields were 66 and 38%. Therefore, the optimum temperature is around 150°C. The activation temperature of the catalysts plays an important role over basal spacing of the catalysts as it is revealed from the fact that the basal spacing of the catalysts is higher at 120°C (not shown in Fig. 4) than at 150°C, but the activity of the acid sites activated at 120°C are lower than that done at 150°C (Figs. 1, 6 and 7 ). 3.1.5 The yield of diphenylmethane against time The percentage yield (Fig. 7) of diphenylmethane in presence of Zn2+-Mont (1.5mmol, 3.33g) and ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont (1.5mmol, 0.926g) against time indicate that within a period of 15min, the yields were 6.8 and 1.0% for Zn2+-Mont and ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont, respectively. With the increase in reaction time, appreciable conversions were obtained, i.e. within 5h of reaction time the corresponding yields were 78.72 and 45.88%, respectively which enhance to 97.6 and 96.7% near 24h. The selectivity in such reaction products are greater than 98%. On further increasing the reaction time to 48h, 100 and 98% conversion for the respective composites were observed. It is interesting to indicate here that during the initial period of the catalytic reaction, the activity of Zn2+-Mont composite is higher than ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont though the latter exhibits higher amount of acid sites (Fig. 2a and d). The higher catalytic activity is attributable to the higher pore volume of the composite Zn2+-Mont (0.032cm3 g−1) than that of ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont (0.011cm3 g−1). Thus, it indicates that the amount of acid sites is not always the indicative parameter for higher catalytic activity. During the later part of the reaction, the activity of the ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont increases and becomes almost equal as that of Zn2+-Mont which indicates that much activation of the acid sites occur in the former composite. It may be mentioned here that the composites do not show any leaching of Zn2+ in the liquid phase. The catalysts are reusable. After the catalytic experiments, the recovered catalysts are activated at desired temperature (150°C). The second and third run indicate negligible loss of activity of the catalysts. 3.1.6 Benzylation of benzene with benzyl chloride The percentage yields of benzylation of benzene to diphenylmethane against time in presence of different catalysts at room temperature are shown in Fig. 1. The results obtained indicate (Fig. 1) that, in general, the percentage yields in the benzylation of benzene increases with time irrespective of the nature of the catalyst activated at 120±10°C. Further, it has been observed that the anhydrous metal salts catalysts, namely ZnCl2, CuCl2 and NiCl2 show the lowest activity. In case of ZnCl2 only about 12% conversion occurred even up to a period of 48h while activity in the case of the other two salts has been found to be negligible. However, the conversion in presence of the metal-Mont catalysts has been found to be higher than that with the anhydrous metal salts catalysts alone. Zn2+-Mont among others has been found to show the highest conversion of about 80% within a period of 48h while Cu2+-Mont and Ni2+-Mont show 16 and 14% conversion, respectively. Amongst the metal-salt-metal-Mont catalysts, ZnCl2-Zn2+-Mont has shown conversion of 76% where as CuCl2-Cu2+-Mont and NiCl2-Ni2+-Mont have shown only 48 and 6.4% conversion, respectively.
