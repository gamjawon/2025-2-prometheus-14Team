(Received December 22,1988; accepted January 16, 1989) Summary Relation between catalyst structure and selectivity of the oxidative coupling of 2,6-dimethylphenol, I, into poly[oxy-(2,6-dimethyl)-l,4- phenylene], II, an important industrial polymer, in the presence of copper(II) complexes with acetate or formate and pyridine or piperidine in chloroform and chloroform + toluene solutions has been studied. Variations in the structure of the catalyst during various steps of the catalytic process have been elucidated using EPR and NMR. Six different types of Cu(II) complexes have been observed and their roles in the catalytic process have been identified. Intermediates that control reaction selectivity towards the desired polymeric product II seem to be mixed Cu(II) complexes with monomeric and oligomeric phenolate ions, acetic or formic ion and amines. The rate- determining step of oxidative coupling in steady-state conditions seems to be electron transfer from phenolate ions to the Cu(II) atom in these complexes. The selectivity is enhanced at high concentrations of these complexes, since in these conditions the monomeric phenoxyl radicals formed in the reaction mixture react mainly with coordinated phenolate and poly- phenolate ligands to yield finally II, rather than recombining to form 3,3',5,5'-tetramethyldiphenoquinone, III, which is the main side product of the reaction. Complexes with oligomeric phenolate ligands seem to provide better selectivity than complexes with monomeric ones, since for the former complexes intramolecular electron transfer does not produce the monomeric phenol radicals necessary to make compound III. Introduction Production of poly[oxy-(2,6-dimethyl)-l,4-phenylene] from 2,6- dimethylphenol is an important industrial process. As is well known, oxida- 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 326 tive coupling of 2,6-dimethylphenol (I) occurs efficiently in the presence of homogeneous catalysts containing copper salts and amines [1-6]. By changing the amine-to-copper concentration ratio in the catalyst, one can dramatically change the process selectivity towards one or the other of the two routes: High amine-to-copper ratios favor C 0 coupling, i.e. formation of poly[oxy-(2,6-dimethyl)-l,4-phenylene] (II), while low amine-to-copper ratios favor C C coupling, i.e. formation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethyl-4,4'- dioxo-l,l'-bicyclohexa-2,5-dienylidene (III) [1-6]. To improve the quality of polymer II, it is necessary to decrease the yield of byproduct III. It is therefore essential to discover the structural characteristics of the copper catalysts that control the selectivity of the oxidative coupling of compound I. At present, the following formal mechanism of the catalytic process is widely accepted [5]: L CliUDL + HO-Q ^ L CudD-O-Q + HL A C (monomer coordination), c -JL . i, cud) + 'o-y / \\ coupling (electron transfer), LiCu(I)^|^LiCu(II)L (catalyst regeneration). (1) (2) (3) In eqns. (1) - (3) L indicates an anionic ligand of the copper complex and Li the set of other ligands. The mechanism involving eqns. (1) - (3) is not, however, complete, since it does not include steps that take into account structural changes of the catalytically active complex upon varying the amine-to-copper ratio 327 and the effect of these changes on the direction of oxidative coupling of the starting monomer I. Most previously published works deal with the catalytic copper chloride + amines systems [1-6], in view of their wide use in industry. However, these systems are inconvenient for mechanistic studies on a molecular level, since with them it is rather difficult to elucidate the composition and struc- ture of copper complexes formed under the reaction conditions. To avoid these difficulties, we have used in this work catalytic systems Cu(II) acetate (Cu(OAc)2 or formate (Cu(HC02)2) plus pyridine or piperidine rather than Cu(II) chloride + amine systems. The structures of the copper complexes formed in our systems have been studied with EPR directly under reaction conditions. Note that the copper formate + piperidine system was found to be only slightly less active than the most active copper chloride + amine system. The main objective of our study was to elucidate the structural factors that control the selectivity of Cu(II) complexes with amines towards formation of compounds II or III in the catalytic process of the oxidative coupling of I. Experimental The solvents used (chloroform, toluene, pyridine (Py)), piperidine (Pipe)) were purified as described in [7, 8]. Compound I was purified by recrystallization from n-heptane solution. Copper acetate and formate were of 'pure for analysis' grade. The reaction was performed at room tempera- ture in chloroform. In the situations where the resolution of EPR spectra had to be improved, a 1:1 (by volume) mixture of chloroform and toluene was used as a solvent. This mixture is easily vitrified upon cooling, which made it possible to obtain very well resolved and thus quite informative anisotropic EPR spectra for copper complexes in these vitreous solutions. Characteristic times for the formation and decay of various Cu(II) complexes during the course of oxidative coupling of I were estimated from the changes with time of the intensity of their EPR signals, the reaction being carried out directly in the EPR cells. Characteristic times for Cu(II) to Cu(I) and Cu(I) to Cu(II) transformations were estimated from time variations of the overall intensity of Cu(II) EPR signal. Variation with time of the concentration of monomer I and various products of its oxidative coupling were elucidated from the intensity of their NMR signals, oxidative coupling being carried out directly in the NMR cells. In both EPR and NMR studies, the reaction was initially carried out in anaerobic conditions. To provide such conditions, the solutions of a Cu(II)- amine catalyst and of the reactant I were deoxygenated carefully by bubbling argon through them. The two solutions were mixed in the argon box and the reaction mixture formed was placed into EPR and NMR cells which were carefully closed with greased corks. Cylindrical cells of 5 mm diameter were used for both EPR and NMR measurements. At specified 328 times the cells were opened and oxygen was bubbled through them for one minute. The cells were then shaken and placed back into the EPR and NMR spectrometers. The volume of the EPR and NMR cells was such that the total amount of oxygen in and above the solution exceeded by ca. six times the amount of I in the sample. In long term experiments, additional oxygen was bubbled occasionally through the solutions for about one minute. When making comparative studies of time variations of the concentra- tion of various Cu(II) complexes, as well as of reactant I and products of its oxidative coupling, strictly identical procedures of sample preparation and its treatment with oxygen were used. EPR spectra were recorded with a Bruker-ER-200 D spectrometer at a frequency of 9500 MHz. Theoretical EPR spectra were simulated with a BESM-6 computer, using programs described in [9]. To measure the concentrations of paramagnetic species, the second integrals of EPR spectra of the sample under study and the reference (CuCIa' 2V.^O single crystal) were compared. NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker CXP-300 spectrometer with a magnetic field of 7 T. Chemical shifts were measured relative to the internal reference, namely hexamethyldisiloxane, HMDS. A Specord M40 spectrometer was employed for optical spectra registration. Results Oxidative coupling of I in copper acetate or formate plus pyridine systems The structure of the starting Cu(OAc)-^ complex with Py The structure of the starting copper acetate complex with Py was first studied in liquid solutions of chloroform at 300 K and in the vitreous solu- tion of chloroform/toluene at 77 K. The concentration of copper acetate was 0.01 M, while that of pyridine was varied from 0.02 to 2 M, i.e. the amine-to-copper ratio changed from 2 to 200. The variation in Py concentra- tion did not affect the EPR parameters of either liquid or frozen Cu(II) solutions. This means that one and the same Cu(II) compound, which we denote as complex A, is observed in these solutions at all the concentrations ofPy. The EPR parameters of complex A are presented in Table 1. These are the average g-factor, go, and hyperfine (hf) constant, do, from the copper nucleus in the liquid solution and the anisotropic values of g-factor, g\\\\ and gi, and hf splitting A]| and Ai, in the frozen solution. As seen from Table 1, the g-factor, go, for complex A in liquid solution practically coincides with the average value go for this complex in the frozen solution, , 1 go = ~(g\\\\ + 2gi). d (4) This means that the structure of complex A in the liquid and frozen solutions is identical. ha s 8 '3 ^ 0 <u 60 11 & <N g +1 .s ^,i-l 1 X 0 a; 0 J3 5' '?> S '?

This increase is explained by the interaction of copper acetate with Py leading to the decomposition of associates formed by copper acetate in CHC13 solution. As known, monomeric copper acetate produces EPR signals in the spectrum region under consideration (around 0.3 T) [10] whereas associates of copper acetate do not. The proportion of Cu(II) acetate monomeric complexes estimated from the EPR signal intensity at 300 K comprises 20% for a con- centration of pyridine [Py] = 0.2 M and 90% for [Py] = 2 M. For Cu(II) formate at the same temperature and [Py] = 0.2 M, the proportion of monomeric complexes is at least three times higher than that for copper acetate. EPR spectral parameters of starting copper complexes in liquid and frozen chloroform solutions are identical for copper acetate and formate. The above data suggest that the structure of starting monomeric copper complex A remains unchanged upon varying the amine-to-copper ratio, while the fraction of the monomeric complex has a tendency to increase with an increase in this ratio. Based on the EPR data, some conclusions can be made concerning the structure of complex A. The EPR spectrum of the frozen Cu(OAc)2 solution containing Py additives exhibited the line shape typical for the axial anisotropy of the g-factor and the value of parameters g\\\\, gi, A|| and Ai typical for octahedral, square pyramidal or square planar Cu(II) complexes. In the region of perpendicular orientation, an additional hyperfine structure (ahfs) from ^N nuclei (nuclear spin I = 1) of the Py nitrogen atoms (hfs constant Ai^N) = 14 G) was observed. However, this structure was insuf- ficiently resolved to determine unambiguously the number of nitrogen nuclei in the coordination sphere of the Cu(II) atom. For this reason in further studies \"N pyridine was used, which contained 96% of the \"N isotope with I = 1/2. In this case the EPR spectrum of the frozen solution (Fig. la) exhibited ahfs for both perpendicular and parallel (see far left and far right components in Fig. la) orientations, with hf constants Ai^N) =A||(15N) = 18 G. For the interpretation of the ahfs, it is necessary to recognize that copper has two magnetic isotopes \"Cu and ^Cu, with natural abundances of 69% and 31%, and a ratio of nuclear magnetic moments ^(\"CuVJLtC^Cu) = 0.9334. The number and position of ahfs lines in the region of parallel orientation, as well as their relative intensities, correspond to the ahfs from two equivalent nitrogen nuclei \"N. This conclusion follows from a comparison of the experimental EPR spectrum with the theoretical one calculated for the case of two nitrogen atoms with An^N) = Ai^N) = 18 G, the values g\\\\ gi, A||, Ai from Table 1 and the line widths CT|| and Oi for various copper hf components in parallel and perpendicular orientations, as indicated in Table 1. Good agreement between the experimental and theoretical spectra is clearly seen in Fig. 1. Much worse agreement with the 331 9-19796 Fig. 1.

Spectra in the region of g\\\\ and g\\_ were registered at dif- ferent amplifications. experimental spectrum was achieved when ahfs in the theoretical spectrum was assumed to result from one, three or four \"N nuclei. It is known that in EPR spectra of octahedral or square-pyramidal Cu(II) complexes having g\\\\ >g\\. the ahfs from ^N and ^N is observed only if nitrogen atoms are located in the equatorial plane of the complexes (see e.g. [11]). From this fact one may conclude that the starting Cu(II) complex A has two pyridine molecules in the equatorial plane, two other equatorial positions probably being occupied by two acetate ions, which make the complex an electrically neutral species. Since square-planar complexes of Cu(II) are known to have a strong tendency to coordinate extra ligands to their axial positions, it seems likely that in the presence of a large (up to 2 M) amount of Py, at least one or perhaps even two more pyridine molecules can be coordinated in the axial direction (see structure A in Fig. 2). The letter S in Fig. 2 designates either the second pyridine molecule, or the solvent molecule, or the vacancy. Further evidence for the presence in complex A of at least one Py molecule, in addition to those giving ahfs from nitrogen nuclei, was obtained when studying the inter- action of A with monomer I. 332 Py Py /vl-^OAc ,'^r/ AcO<-'\"+^Py Py Py 4 OAC / -L.U / )^-+-^py Pig. 2. Proposed idealized structures of Cu(II) complexes formed in the process of catalytic coupling of I. The symbol S stands for Py, the solvent molecule or the vacancy. The structure of the intermediate formed upon rapid interaction of the starting Cu(II) complex with 2,6-dimethylphenol EPR data for frozen solutions: Immediately after addition of I to the solution of starting complex A, provided that [Py] < [I], the EPR spectrum of the frozen solution (Fig. Ib) begins to change, i.e. a new complex B is formed. In this case the substitution of the phenolate ion for the acetate ion via reaction (1) does not occur because, as will be shown below, reaction (1) is very slow in this system. In complex B, two pyridine molecules are still coordinated in the equatorial plane. This fact is supported by retention of ahfs from two \"N nuclei within the regions of both parallel and perpen- dicular orientations in the EPR spectrum (Fig. Ib). A theoretical spectrum of complex B with g^, g^, A||, Ai, a\\\\ and 01 values listed in Table 1 and ahfs from two \"N nuclei (Ant^N) = Ai^N) = 18 G) is shown in Fig. Ib, dotted line. It is seen to fit well the experimental spectrum shown by the solid line. Again, much worse agreement with the experimental spectrum was achieved when ahfs in the theoretical spectrum was assumed to result from one, three or four \"N nuclei. The appearance immediately after addition of I to the solution of A (at [I] > [Py]) of the new complex B, which still retains two Py molecules in the equatorial positions and is formed very rapidly, i.e. before reaction (1) can proceed, is easily explained by substitution of a Py molecule with a molecule of I at the axial coordination site of Cu(II). In agreement with this conclusion, no transformation of complex A to complex B was observed for the frozen solution at [I] < [Py]. Additional support for such an explana- tion arises from the fact that the type of variation of EPR parameters, when going from complex A to B (decrease in g,, and increase in A)|) is typical for the substitution of a stronger nitrogen-containing base (Py) by a weaker 333 oxygen-containing one (2,6-dimethylphenol) in the axial position of the Cu(II) complexes [12,13]. Based on the accumulated data, it is possible to suggest for complexes A and B the structures given in Fig. 2. EPR data for liquid solutions: For liquid solutions at 300 K, provided that [I]/[Py] S 5, the EPR spectrum also tends to change after addition of I to the solution of complex A. Note, however, that at 300 K the EPR spectrum observed after addition of I was actually the weighted average spectrum over the EPR spectra ascribed to complexes A and B, rather than the superposition of their EPR spectra. This indicates fast (on the EPR time scale) exchange of Cu(II) between complexes A and B at room temperature. Therefore, in order to determine go and Ay for complex B from the experi- mental spectrum at 300 K, it is necessary to know the relative concentra- tions of complexes A and B at this temperature, i.e. measure the equilibrium constant K for the reaction: K B+Py^==^A+I (5) The value of K was measured by the optical spectroscopy method. One can easily obtain the following expression relating variations in optical density of solution at a given wavelength within the absorption region of complexes A and B with variations in concentrations of I, provided that the concentration of Py is fixed: [I] // K[l]\\ A,-^[A]o^(e.-eB)/(l^) (6) Here Dy is optical density at [I] = 0, D is optical density at a given con- centration of I, [A]o is concentration of complex A at 1= 0; e^ and CB are extinction coefficients of complexes A and B respectively at a given wave- length (in our experiments X = 715 nm); / is the optical path length. In agree- ment with eqn. (6), the plot of (Do .D)\"1 vs. [Py]/[I] was found to be a straight line. From the slope of this line and its intercept one can calculate the value of K. Using this procedure we found K = 7 2. Having found K, we can now find the EPR parameters gy and do of complex B from the averaged EPR spectra of A and B observed in solutions. As expected, within the accuracy of the experiments, these parameters were found to be identical when measured for the solutions with various ratios of [A]/[B]. Table 1 presents the values go and QQ of complex B found from the EPR spectrum of the sample with [Py] = 0.1 M and [I] = 1 M. Due to the highest concentration of I, the EPR spectrum of this sample had the most pronounced difference from the original spectrum of complex A. Note that the value gy for complex B in the liquid solution coincides, within the accuracy of the experiments, with the value go found for this complex in 334 the frozen solution. Similar to complex A behavior, this suggests identical structures for complex B in both solutions. Thus the data obtained suggest that, prior to substitution of acetate ion by phenolate ion via reaction (1), the structure of starting monomeric complexes of Cu(II) in the presence of acetate anion, Py and monomer I is determined by the [I]/[Py] ratio rather than by the ratio [Py]/[Cu(OAc)2]. The change in structure of Cu(II) complexes in the course of the catalytic reaction However, further experiments suggested that the differences in catalytic behavior of the systems with different amine-to-copper ratios are not related to the fast equilibrium reaction (5), but arise during the slower step of substitution of phenolate ion for acetate ion (reaction (1)). This conclusion was drawn on the basis of the following experiments. We compared varia- tions of EPR spectra during the course of oxidative coupling of I for two samples, a and (3, with a [Py]/[Cu(OAc)2] ratio equal to 2 and 20, respec- tively. The reaction was effected at 300 K under anaerobic conditions in argon atmosphere. The samples were preliminarily outgassed under vacuum, which allowed elimination of the catalyst regeneration step (reaction (3)). Both samples had the same concentration of monomer I and copper acetate, namely: [I] = 0.1 M and [Cu(OAc)2] = 0.01 M. The concentration of pyridine was 0.02 M in sample a and 0.2 M in sample j3. In the course of the reaction, probes were occasionally taken from the samples and put into the cylindrical EPR cells, which were then placed in liquid nitrogen and their EPR spectra in vitreous solution at 77 K were recorded. EPR studies: From the EPR spectrum at 77 K of sample j3 with [Py]/ [Cu(OAc)2] = 20 (Fig. 3B) registered at various moments after the beginning of the reaction, one can see that an equilibrium is gradually established between the starting copper complex A and the new complex C. No complex B was observed, since for sample j3 equilibrium (5) was shifted to the right. There is certain experimental evidence that complex C is formed as a result of substitution of phenolate ion for acetate ion in complex A, i.e. via a reversible reaction (1). For example, in agreement with this conclusion EPR data show that the increase in concentration of I shifts the equilibrium between A and C towards complex C, while addition of acetic acid shifts this equilibrium towards complex A. We tried to observe via NMR the direct increase in concentration of acetic acid formed during substitution of the phenolate ion for the acetate ion, simultaneously with the increasing concentration of complex C. But unfortunately, the chemical shift for CH3 protons of acetic acid occurred too close to that for CH3 protons of the products of oxidative coupling of I, making such measurements impossible. However, when using copper formate in place of acetate, we did succeed in recording an ^ NMR signal with the chemical shift 8 = 8.01 ppm, attributed to the C H proton of formic acid, whose integral intensity corresponded, with an accuracy of 335 Fig. 3.

Spectra in the region of g^ and g^ were registered at different amplifications. 30% typical for concentration measurements with EPR, to the substitution of one formate ion in the copper complex by one phenolate ion via reaction (1). Note that the concentration of Py in sample j8 was sufficient to cause practically complete dissociation of the polynuclear formate complexes not observed with EPR into monomeric pyridine-containing complexes A observed with EPR. This last conclusion was based on two facts. First, the initial (before addition of I) concentration of complex A in sample (3, mea- sured from the intensity of its EPR spectrum in the liquid solution, was found to coincide with the known total concentration of Cu(II) in this solu- tion, within the 30% accuracy of the concentration measurements via EPR. Second, a further increase in Py concentration above 0.2 M produced no additional increase in the intensity of the EPR spectrum, indicating that in the sample no more associates remain which can dissociate. After addition of I in concentrations exceeding 0.8 M, practically all Cu(II) compounds, i.e. complexes A and B, that are initially present in the reaction solution were found according to EPR data to transform with time into complex C. Note that the dependences of EPR spectral variations on concentra- tions of reagents A, I, HL (where HL is acetic or formic acid) and Py, and on reaction time, were found to be qualitatively the same for copper acetate and formate. The experimental EPR spectrum of a frozen solution of complex C in chloroform-toluene mixture (1:1) is shown in Pig. Ic (solid line). The spec- trum was recorded 24 h after onset of reaction. In the region of parallel and perpendicular orientations, splittings are observed from four equivalent nitrogen atoms \"N. The theoretical spectrum, with the values g^, gi, A||, Ai, 336 CT|| and oi from Table 1 and ahfs from four nitrogen atoms with Au^N) = Al(lsN)= 18 G, is shown in Fig. Ic (dotted line). In calculations of the theoretical spectrum, the presence of two magnetic isotopes of copper was taken into account. The theoretical and experimental spectra, shown in Fig. Ic, are seen to be in very good agreement. Much worse agreement with the experimental spectrum was achieved when ahfs in the theoretical spectrum was assumed to result from less than four \"N nuclei. Note that the situations where the EPR spectrum has splittings from two or four nitrogen atoms can be distinguished reliably for the spectra of Fig la, b, and c, due to a well-resolved ahfs in the region of parallel orienta- tion. In the region of perpendicular orientation, the difference between the spectra with structure from two and four nitrogen atoms is not as pronounced. Thus according to EPR at 77 K, complex C has four pyridine molecules in the equatorial plane. A probable structure of complex C at 77 K is shown in Fig. 2. Interestingly, in the liquid solution at 300 K complex C exhibits a structure different from that at 77 K. In fact, for this complex go', calculated from gn and gi via formula (4), differs markedly from go (see Table 1). Consequently, when passing from the frozen (77 K) to the liquid (300 K) solution, the structure of complex C changes (C transforms to C'). Note that this transformation is fast and reversible, i.e. the EPR spectrum of the mixture of complexes A and C is again observed upon rapid cooling of the liquid solution back to 77 K. The coincidence of go and OQ parameters for complexes A and C' at 300 K (Table 1) suggests the similar structures of these complexes. Such a similarity may occur if two pyridine molecules, one acetate and one phenolate (or no acetate and two phenolate) ions are coordinated in the equatorial plane of C', and in addition one or two molecules of Py are coordinated in the axial direction (see Fig. 2). For sample a with [Py]/[Cu(OAc)2] = 2 before addition of I, only an EPR signal corresponding to complex A is observed. Immediately after addi- tion of I, in accord with the equilibrium constant found previously (K = 7 2) for reaction (5), lines attributed to complexes A and B appear in the EPR spectra at both 300 and 77 K. No further changes in the EPR spectra of both liquid and frozen solutions of sample a were observed in the process of oxidative coupling of I during 60 h, in contrast to sample j3. EPR signals corresponding to complexes C and C' in which one or two acetate ions had been substituted by one or two phenolate ions, were not observed. This fact implies that even if complexes C and C' are formed, their concentrations should comprise no more than 10% of the sum of concentra- tions of complexes A and B present in the solution. Interestingly, addition of pyridine (Py = 0.2 - 2.0 M) to sample a at various times after reaction onset resulted only in transformation of complex B to complex A (i.e. substitution of molecule I by a Py molecule in the axial position according to equilibrium (5)) but not in the immediate formation of C. Several hours were needed after addition of Py to sample a for the equilibrium between A and C to be established, as was the case for sample P. 337 Thus, at a low initial concentration of Py equilibrium (1) is shifted toward starting materials, i.e. the equilibrium constant for the reaction of substitution of the acetate ion by the phenolate ion is largely dependent on the number, m, of Py molecules in the coordination sphere of Cu(II). Only at sufficiently large m is this constant high. In other words, additional Py molecules, in excess of those present in complexes A and B, are necessary to make reaction (1) fast enough. Note that in EPR spectra of liquid solutions of samples a and j3 there appears an additional multiple! signal during the reaction (see spectra c and d of Fig. 3A and Fig. 4). According to [14,15], this signal belongs to the polymer radical IV. v VI The two methyl groups in IV are magnetically inequivalent, with hf splitting Ai = 5 G and A^ = 6 G, the splitting on two equivalent meta-protons being A 3= 1 G. Note also that at low amine concentration (sample a) the con- centration of polymer radical IV is significantly (10 times) higher than at a larger concentration of amine (sample fS). From EPR spectra of the solutions (Fig. 3A, a - d), it is seen that for sample (3 the signal intensity attributed to Cu(II) complex tends to decrease Fig. 4. EPR spectrum for polymeric radical IV arising during oxidative coupling of I. [Cu(OAc)2] = 0.01 M, [Py] = 0.02 M, [I] = 0.1 M, solvent chloroform. 338 during the reaction, due to the Cu(II) to Cu(I) transformation (reaction (2)). The rate of the decrease in Cu(II) concentration is close to the rate at which the equilibrium between the starting complex A and complex C is established. This means that reaction (2) occurs at a rate exceeding or close to the rate of reaction (1). Admission of oxygen to the sample very quickly restores the earlier signal intensity, due to reoxidation of Cu(I) by molecular oxygen (reaction (3)). It seems of interest that it is the intensity of the EPR signal of complex C, and not of the initial complex A, that increases during reoxidation. One reason may be the formation in the course of reaction (3) of the Cu^I)-^\" complex resulting from reoxidation of the Cu(I) complex by molecular oxygen. In the C^II) ^\" complex the superoxide ion could perhaps easily be substituted by both phenolate and acetate ion. But since the content of acetic acid in solution is far smaller than that of I, the superoxide ion is substituted mainly by the phenolate ion, and eventually complex C, rather than A, is formed. Note also that, strictly speaking, the coincidence of the EPR spectrum observed after reoxidation with that for complex C does not mean that the Cu(II) complex formed after reoxidation is exactly complex C. It is more appropriate to conclude that the complex formed after reoxidation has the nearest surrounding of the Cu(II) atom rather close to that for complex C. In fact, as will be shown below by NMR, even during the initial steps of oxidative coupling of I, dimers and oligomers of I are found whose anions, like those of the monomer I, can coordinate to the reoxidized Cu(II) complexes. For sample a, in which a larger proportion of Cu(OAc)2 is in the form of associates undetectable by EPR, we were unable to examine time- dependent variations of the Cu(II) concentration. NMR studies: The products of oxidative coupling of I were identified from 'H NMR spectra. For sample |3, 20 h after the start of the reaction under anaerobic conditions, seven lines were observed in the spectral region characteristic of protons of methyl groups (Fig. 5). From comparison of ^ NMR spectra of isolated compounds I, II, III and V, the line at 2.26 ppm is attributed to CHa protons of I, the line at 2.08 ppm is attributed to CH3 protons of II, the line at 2.15 ppm to CH3 protons of III, and that at 2.11 ppm to CH3 protons of dimer V [16]. Note that according to [16], protons of the CH3 groups located near the hydroxyl and ether groups of dimer V are inequivalent and have chemical shifts at 2.12 and 2.10 ppm in CDC13 solution. In our system the dimer lines are broadened, probably due to the presence of paramagnetic complexes of Cu(II), and a single common line at 2.11 ppm is observed. The lines at 2.16 and 2.03 ppm, indicated by asterisks in Fig. 5, can be attributed to trimer or other oligomers of I. This conclusion follows from the fact that the ^H NMR spectra of polymers of II with short enough molecular chains, i.e. with small n, exhibit along with an intense signal at 2.08 ppm, also two weak signals at 2.16 and 2.03 ppm attributed to methyl protons of terminal groups [17]. A line at 2.19 ppm seems to 339 2.4 2019 2.4 201.9 2.4 2019 24 201.9 24 2019 Fig. 5. 'H NMR spectra recorded during the oxidative coupling of I in the presence of Cu(OAc)2: (a) 20 h after the beginning of the reaction under anaerobic conditions; (b) - (e) sample (a) at 1, 3.5, 7 and 60 h, respectively, after oxygen admission; [Cu(OAc)2] = 0.01 M; [Py] = 0.2 M; [I] = 0.1 M, solvent chloroform, T = 300 K. belong to CH3 protons of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethyl-4,4'-dioxydimethylphenyl (VI). One may expect that the formation of VI should precede the forma- tion of III, and in the presence of oxygen VI should transform to III. In agreement with this, admission of oxygen removes the 2.19 ppm line (see Pig. 5e). Note that in agreement with such an assignment of this line, samples having the smallest concentration of VI at earlier stages (a line at 2.19 ppm) were also found to have the smallest concentration of III (a line at 2.15 ppm) at later stages of the reaction after oxygen had been admitted to the samples. From Fig. 5a it is seen that, prior to oxygen admission under anaerobic conditions, comparable amounts of III, VI, dimer V and other oligomers of I are formed, the concentration of polymer II being negligible. Oxygen admis- sion (Fig. 5b - d) leads to a marked increase in intensity of the NMR signal attributed to CH3 protons of polymer II and oligomers of I. NMR signals corresponding to III, VI and V increase to a much smaller extent. After termination of the reaction, only signals from II and III remain in the ^ NMR spectrum (Fig. 5e). 'H NMR spectra for sample a (Fig. 6a) suggest that formation of III and V prevails under anaerobic conditions. Addition of oxygen enhances concentrations of III and II (Fig. 6b). Note that while in sample fS the final content of III is 20%, in sample a it is 60%, moreover, for sample a under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions the transformations under study occur much more slowly than for sample ^. The characteristic times for reac- tion product accumulation for sample a are at least five times longer than for sample ft, which is in agreement with an earlier conclusion about the low concentration of presumably (see reaction (1)) catalytically active complexes C in sample a. 340 Q b C 24 22 20 24 22 20 24 22 20 Fig. 6. ^ NMR spectra recorded during oxidative coupling of I in the presence of Cu(OAc)2: (a) 72 h after the beginning of the reaction under anaerobic conditions; (b), (c) sample (a) at 1.5 h and 70 h, respectively, after oxygen admission; [Cu(OAc)2] = 0.01 M, [Py] = 0.02 M and [I] = 0.1 M, solvent chloroform, T = 300 K. It is known that admixtures of III in polymer II deteriorate the quality of the polymer. It is therefore important to suppress the formation of III. Interestingly, in sample j3 the main portion of VI and III is produced under anaerobic conditions before Cu(I) reoxidation to Cu(II) by molecular oxygen. As has already been mentioned, oxygen admission results in a considerable increase in the concentration of II and a relatively small increase in the concentration of III and VI (see Fig. 5b - e). A similar effect has been reported in the literature [6]. Further investigations of the catalytic systems containing piperidine instead of pyridine provided evidence for the fact that the increase in reaction selectivity towards the useful product II is caused by the change of the catalyst structure under the action of reaction products formed after the admission of oxygen. Oxidative coupling of I in copper acetate or formate plus piperidine systems Most studies considered in this section deal with copper formate, since for this substance, in contrast to copper acetate, one can observe by *H NMR the formation of formic acid during substitution of the formate ion by the phenolate ion. In other words, one can obtain additional information on the step of monomer coordination (reaction (1)). The structure of complexes formed in anaerobic conditions The structure of complexes formed upon dissolution of copper formate and acetate in CHC^ solutions with Pipe additives was studied with EPR. As in the case of Py, the EPR spectrum (Fig. 7a) of the starting Cu(II) complex formed prior to addition of I is not changed upon variation of the concentra- tion of Pipe in the range [Pipe] = 0.02 - 0.2 M. The EPR parameters, i.e. the three main values of ^-tensor gi, g^, 3 and hf splitting constants Ai, A 2, As in frozen 1:1 chloroform/toluene solution and the average ^-factor go and hf splitting constant OQ for this complex are listed in the first line of Table 2. The parameters for the frozen solution have been found via computer simulation procedures. Note that no difference between g^ and ^3, 341 !0 nT Pig. 7.

The starting complex seems to have structure A (Fig. 2) with Pipe instead of Py. In fact, the value of gy for this complex (see complex A in Table 2) is more typical for complexes containing two, rather than four, nitrogen atoms in the equatorial plane [12,13]. In addition, the values otgy and SQ for complex A with Pipe are smaller than for the complex with Py, as was reasonable to expect upon substitution of a less basic ligand Py by a more basic ligand Pipe in the equatorial plane [18]. Immediately after addition of I to the solution of the starting complex ([Cu(HC02)2] ss 0.01 M, [Pipe] = 0.1 M, [I] = 0.1 M, anaerobic conditions), a new EPR spectrum for the frozen solution (Fig. 7B, b) and a signal at 8.01 ppm in the ^ NMR spectrum of the liquid solution attributed to formic acid were observed. The concentration of formic acid, found from the integral intensity of the 8.01 ppm signal, was found to be equal to the total concentration of Cu(II) atoms in the solution, i.e. it corresponded to the substitution of one formate ion by one phenolate ion in the starting complex. The concentration of formic acid was calculated from the ratio of integral intensities m the ^ NMR spectrum of the 8.01 ppm signal > ^^ /--A. & W t C 0 04-1 -t-> 0, a a +N u .S.S tt 4 Nl x0 S S 0 + N IS, ro f- ^ ^ 4> V iffl J1 a t '\"<i\" N 01-1 T-(oi N ' SW <N,,i-li-l' o pj IN | | 33!>> >i 0 t) 0) ^ sm vS 1.4 a.i sa 01 ^ *\"\" li s S'g ?? + x \" .. 10 US) a oN 0+1 10 10 \\ 1~- C~ 1111 a t, n S a Sa U 1^^. a .c M US VI W a. a 1 '& ^' s 1 -< 0 0 tO 0 N N S M Sg 11 S v fflO tit+l -1 r-1 IN IN / r-1will a! 0,^ gg| so S ^ N<M0 'to0 1 1 0 10 , , W (N 1 | co-\"10 ' M \"-S 0 Ml TO u S . 3'g.g 'S. oT ^ g i.a| 1 x 5 2 o 1 \"CO << +1 0 01-1 1-1 * * 1 I r-1 r-1 | | ^ Cu .5*3 B S ^ \" 0) s S ,, a ro 'S ,g \"s ^ ^ T-t w S '30 2 ^r\" F* j i.s x S \" 1} I \"Vl ^ +1 0 0r-1 r-1 10 10 , , 10 10 1 1 1.1^ V ^.o- 1' rt <D 2 .5 -0 0 1 c c H) '\"i ff 3 *' X X S ^ oo 0 10 CB e c a .5 Ta, W \"CO ; +1 CO 01r-1 1-1 N 00 0> r-1 Q i-l T-I r-1 ~ fi(Q ^-> Cia 1-1 s a ri g S \" g W ^>6s '3.I u CO0 0 10 1-1 ^ tt< > 'S.8 CO 10ro w -r w ^?i^ |o Iw-t tat+1 0 0<? <?i ooooN C< c4 <N sl a c S ) 4 S3 5 11^ W 00 10 r-1 ^ 41 CTi-l IN -st' 1-1 g U 4-ts|\" Su a? 0 0 <n N i-l i-l 0 i-l<?i w <? oi tQ Id|li 1 oa:0CL, K r-t 0 0-.0 t- CT 00 <M <N N ^ r-10 N N C-IM N CO CM 1^-.^ (Sj 3 i i.El^s a S.

By analogy, with the system containing Py, one can also suppose the formation, upon addition of I, of the complex having structure C (Fig. 2) in which Pipe molecules are coordinated instead of Py molecules. Indeed, the decrease in gy when passing from complex A to C (see Table 2) can be explained by the increase in the number of nitrogen atoms in the equatorial plane of the complex [13]. Like for Py, at 300 K complex C seems to transform to complex C' with a structure close to that of complex A (Fig. 2). Note that the above results and conclusions for copper formate are also valid for copper acetate. It should be remembered that in the case of Py the substitution of acetate or formate ion by the phenolate ion requires tens of hours (Fig. 3), while in the case of Pipe it occurs during several seconds. Probably as the amine basicity is increased, the strength of the bond between the acetate or formate ion and the copper atom is decreased, and thus the substitution reaction is accelerated. After addition of I to the piperidine-containing system in anaerobic conditions, the EPR signal of Cu(II) gradually disappears with time. This decrease in the EPR spectrum intensity can be explained by the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I). In agreement with this explanation, the EPR spectrum intensity was found to be restored very quickly upon admis- sion of oxygen into the sample. The observed reaction constant feobs t0!\" Cu(II) to Cu(I) reduction, as determined from kinetics of the decrease in the EPR spectrum integral intensity, equals 3 X 10\"4 s~1 at 300 K and can be referred to reaction (2) as the rate-determining step in the sequence of reactions (1) and (2). The *H NMR spectrum in the region 2 ppm exhibits lines attributed earlier to CH3 protons of polymer II, dimer V and other oligomers of I (see Fig. 8a). A weak line at 2.15 ppm from CH3 protons of III was not observed, 25 20 25 2.0 25 20 25 20 Fig. 8. *H NMR spectra recorded during oxidative coupling of I in the presence of Cu(HCOO)2: (a) 4 h after onset of the reaction under anaerobic conditions; (b) - (d) sample (a) at 20 min, 60 min, 48 h respectively, after oxygen admission; [Cu(HCOO)z] = 0.01 M, [Pipe] = 0.1 M and [I] = 0.1 M. 344 presumably because of its superposition on the very strong lines at 2.16 ppm corresponding to oligomers of I. However, a signal at 7.74 ppm in the NMR spectrum attributed to protons of the quinone ring of III may be taken as evidence for the formation of III in ~ 0.001 M concentration. After oxygen admission, the line corresponding to I disappears faster than in the case of Py, and the line intensity corresponding to II tends to increase (see Fig. 8b, c). The intensity of the 7.74 ppm line attributed to III increases only slightly. The structure of complexes formed upon admission of oxygen As mentioned above, the reoxidation of Cu(II) by molecular oxygen restores the integral intensity of the EPR signal. However, the shape of the EPR spectra at 300 and 77 K is essentially different from that of EPR spectra for complexes of types A and C (Fig. 7d). At 300 K, the EPR spectrum (Fig. 7A, d) has, in addition to a weak line at its right-hand side corresponding to complex A, an intensive asymmetric line with unresolved hfs from the copper nucleus and gy s 2.139. At 77 K the EPR spectrum (Fig. 7B, d) presents a superposition of two spectra: the spectrum produced by complex A (see lines denoted by asterisks) and a new spectrum, whose shape, in contrast to that of the spectra considered above, can be described satisfactorily only on the assumption of a three-fold anisotropy of the ^-factor. The EPR parameters corresponding to this spectrum from a new complex D are listed in Table 2. These parameters were found via computer simulation of the EPR spectrum. A theoretical spectrum of the new complex D with parameters listed in Table 2 is shown in Fig. 7B, d (dotted line). Thus, during the reaction the complex of type C transforms into a new complex D. The appearance of complex D is assumed to involve the incorporation of some reaction products, e.g. oligomers of I or their anions, into the coordination sphere of Cu(II). Note that, according to ^ NMR data, oligomers of I are the only new compounds present in noticeable con- centrations in the system after reoxidation of Cu(I) by molecular oxygen (see Fig. 8b). It should be noted that at the low concentrations of I ([I] = [Cu(HC02)2] = 0.01 M) present after Cu(I) to Cu(II) reoxidation, an EPR spectrum (Fig. 7B, e) is produced which also has a three-fold anisotropy of the ^-tensor but parameters essentially different from those of complex D. In other words, yet another complex (complex E) is formed. A theoretical spectrum that provides the best fit with the experimental spectrum of complex E is shown by the dotted line in Fig. 7B, e and its parameters are listed in Table 2. EPR data show that complex E transforms to complex D upon further addition of I to the sample. This fact can be accounted for by the substitution of acetate or formate ion in complex E by the phenolate ion. Note that the trends and the scale of variations of EPR parameters, which occur upon transformation of complex C to complex D, are the same as those observed earlier for the transformation from square-planar to tetrahedral coordination of the copper atom in Cu(II) bis(JV-alkylsalicyl- 345 aldiminato) complex [19] (see Table 2). In [19], EPR spectra are given of this.Cu(II) complex stabilized as an impurity in a diamagnetic matrix of Pd or Zn complex with the same ligands. According to X-ray data, the geometry of the nearest neighbors of the copper atom was determined by the geometry of the complexes in a diamagnetic matrix, and was square-planar for the Pd-containing matrix and tetrahedral for the Zn-containing matrix. The EPR parameters of Cu(II) bis(.N-i-Pr-5-Me-salicylaldiminato) complexes in square-planar (Cu, Pd) and tetrahedral (Cu, Zn) coordinations, obtained in [19], are listed in Table 2. The values of A are given in [19] in Gauss; in the Table they are converted to cm\"1. It can be seen that in the case of tetrahedral coordination, g^ tends to increase while A] decreases sharply, and a significant three-fold anisotropy of g-factor appears, i.e. gi^gy. As has already been mentioned, the trends and scale of variations of EPR parameters upon transformation from complex C to complex D are similar to those observed upon transformation from square to tetrahedral coordination of the copper atom in the Cu(II)-bis(Ar-alkylsalicylaldiminato) complex. Thus, the tetrahedral coordination of the copper atom seems to be characteristic of complex D. The same coordination can also be tentatively suggested for complex E. This supposition is made on the basis of a noticeable three-fold anisotropy of the ^-factor and a low value of Ai in complex E, which are characteristic also of complex D and the tetrahedral isomer of Cu(II)-bis(salicylaldiminato) complex (see Table 2). To determine reliably the composition of complexes D and E, additional investigations are needed. From the available data, we can conclude that these complexes incorporate some products of oxidative coupling of I. Most probably, this is the anion which is formed upon abstraction of the proton from the hydroxyl group of an oligomer of I. In addition, complex D seems to contain the 2,6- dimethylphenolate anion, and complex E the HCOCT anion. The proposed structures for complexes D and E are shown in Fig. 2. It is not clear as yet why tetrahedral complexes of types D and E are observed for piperidine and are not observed for pyridine. We may only suppose that this difference is due to the different basicity of these amines. As a stronger base, piperidine appears to be capable of stabilizing the co- ordination sphere of Cu(II) in the systems under study at lower coordination numbers than does pyridine, so that tetrahedral coordination with the coordination number 4 becomes energetically favourable enough for Pipe but not for Py. Discussion Most of the earlier studies on the composition and structure of copper complexes formed during the oxidative coupling of I have been devoted to catalytic systems of the copper chloride-amine type [1-6]. Studies of copper complexes in such systems by EPR are rather non-informative, since EPR spectra of copper complexes with halide ions usually demonstrate 346 rather poor resolution. The choice of such catalytic systems as copper acetate-amine and copper formate-amine characterized by well-resolved EPR spectra has allowed us to extract data on variations of the structure of copper complexes during oxidative coupling of I as well as upon variation of the amine-to-copper and monomer-to-copper ratios (see proposed structures of the complexes in Fig. 2). As found, at a small amine-to-copper ratio the proportion of Cu(II) complexes C and C' which include phenolate ions is insignificant. At a large amine-to-copper ratio, this proportion increases drastically and thus C and C' prevail over other Cu(II) complexes present in the solution. At a small amine-to-copper ratio in the presence of oxygen, a by-product, namely diphenoquinone III, is mainly formed, while at large amine-to-copper ratios the desired product polymer II is mainly formed. A logical explanation of these facts is that in the former case most of the phenoxy radicals formed via reaction (2) disappear, mainly via the recombination process: 0 o o (7) which first produces compound VI and then compound III. In the latter case, i.e. at large amine-to-copper ratios, the decay of phenoxy radical occurs mainly via interaction with the coordinated phenolate ion: LCu\"-0-t) + 0-b -^ LCu\"-0-h^O^ - LCu' + HO-^-0-^ or with the coordinated phenoxy radical 6- LCuI'-oO - LCu'-6<J (8a) (8b) LCu1 + Within such a scheme, the yields of products III and II are determined by the ratio of the rates of reactions (7) and (8). As mentioned above, even at large amine-to-copper ratios, in the initial reaction step some amounts of side products VI and III are formed. However, their concentration increases insignificantly as compared to the increase in the concentration of polymer II. This fact can be accounted for by the formation during the reaction of new Cu(II) complexes from the 347 starting complex, the new Cu(II) complexes containing, along with the phenolate ion, oligomeric anion ligands. Formation of such new Cu(II) complexes, presumably containing oligomeric ligands, was observed for catalytic systems with piperidine (see structure D in Fig. 2). The introduc- tion of the substituent OCfiH5 into the para position of the phenol is known to enhance the electron-donor properties of the latter. In fact, the Hammet constant, a, is 0.32 for para-phenoxyphenol [20]. Therefore, it may be expected that in this complex an electron will be transferred to the Cu(II) atom predominantly from the oligomeric ligand: ^ LCu\"^ > LCu' -I- 0-)_V-0-^3 b ^ (9) In this case the diphenoquinone III is not produced because monomeric phenoxy radicals are not formed. Assuming the selectivity of the catalytic systems based on copper salts and amines to be dependent upon the above factors, one should anticipate an increase in the yield of III with increasing concentration of monomer I, since in this situation it is possible that the monomer ion displaces the oligomeric ligand from the coordination sphere of copper. The electron transfer from the monomeric ligand should result in the appearance of monomeric phenoxy radicals and thus, of III. Special experiments indicated that, indeed, the yield of III increased five-fold as the concentration of I was increased from 0.04 to 0.2 M ([Cu(HC02)2] = 0.01 M; [Pipe] = 0.1 M). Thus, in order to increase the yield of II and decrease the yield of III, it is necessary to maintain some optimal, i.e. neither too small nor too large, concentration of monomer I in the catalytic system. Another important problem concerns the influence of the nature of the amine on the rates of various steps of the catalytic reaction under considera- tion. A comparison of results obtained with the use of pyridine and piperidine as amines is useful. The first step of the catalytic reaction is that of substitution of acetate or formate ion by phenolate ion (reaction (1)). As has been mentioned above, for Py such substitution occurs at 300 K during tens of hours, while for Pipe it requires less than tens of seconds. Probably, upon increasing amine basicity the bond between acetate or formate ion and the copper atom becomes weaker and thus its substitution is accelerated. Interestingly, in pilot-plant experiments with pyridine quite a long induction period (about 1 h) was observed before oxidative coupling reaction of I actually starts. In experiments with piperidine the reaction started almost as soon as the monomer I and oxygen were added. The pilot system was a a glass reactor whose design provided for oxygen feed and vigorous agitation 348 of the reaction mixture. The catalytic reaction rate was determined from oxygen absorption. Concentrations of copper formate, amine and the monomer were 0.01, 0.1 and 0.8 M, respectively. Most probably, the long induction period for the pyridine-containing system is due to the slowness of the formation of complex C (reaction (1)). The second step of the catalytic reaction is generally agreed to be electron transfer from the coordinated phenolate ion to Cu(II), producing phenoxy radical (reaction (2)). Unfortunately, for Py one cannot measure the rate constant for reaction (2), since this reaction is not the rate- determining step of the process under anaerobic conditions (see above). However, judging from the overall rate of the process, it can be said that this rate constant exceeds 3 X 10~5 s~1 at 300 K. Note that for Pipe k = 3 X 10~4 s~1 under otherwise identical conditions. The other steps of the catalytic reaction, namely reactions (3), (7), and (8a) or (8b), are faster than reaction (2). Indeed, if reactions 7, 8a (or 8b) were slower than reaction (2), considerable concentrations (ca. 10~2 M) of monomeric phenoxy radicals would accumulate in the system. In reality, with the aid of EPR we observed in the systems studied only polymeric radicals IV in concentrations not higher than 3 X 10~4 M. Regarding reaction (3), EPR data suggest that reoxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) takes place im- mediately after admission of molecular oxygen, i.e. with a characteristic time shorter than several tens of seconds. Note that under anaerobic condi- tions reaction (2) is not the rate-determining step for pyridine-containing systems, while for piperidine-containing systems reaction (2) is the rate- determining step in these conditions. The catalyst reoxidation by molecular oxygen (reaction (3)) was shown to restore the initial concentration of Cu(II). In the case of Py, the concentration of complxes C rather than A increased immediately upon admission of oxygen. Thus, after reoxidation of Cu(I) complexes by molecular oxygen, the formation of complexes C is fast enough, so that the rate-determining step for the overall sequence of reactions (1)-(3) in aerobic conditions, as for Pipe in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, seems to be electron transfer from the phenolate ion or oligomeric ionic ligand to Cu(II). The last conclusion follows from the fact that in the steady-state regime under aerobic conditions the concentra- tion of Cu(II) species, as evidenced by EPR data, is close to the total copper concentration, i.e. exceeds considerably the concentration of Cu(I) species for both Py and Pipe. In the presence of oxygen, the oxidative coupling of I occurs much faster in the case of Pipe than in the case of Py (cf. data in Figs. 5b - d and 8b, c). These data suggest that after catalyst reoxidation the electron transfer is faster for Pipe than for Py. A similar result was mentioned previously in [5] for copper chloride plus amine catalysts, and seems quite surprising at first glance. In fact, one might expect a decrease rather than increase in electron-acceptor ability of Cu(II) upon substitution of Py (pKa = 5.23) by a more basic Pipe (pKg =11.12) in the coordination sphere of copper under otherwise identical conditions. However, this would be valid only if 349 the structure of the catalytically active complex remained unchanged upon amine substitution. Actually, in the systems studied in this work, the catalytically active complexes arising from catalyst reoxidation have struc- tures C and C' for Py and D for Pipe. In complexes C and D the number of amine molecules differ, and it appears likely that in complex D two Pipe molecules suppress the electron-acceptor ability of Cu(II) to a lesser extent than three or four Py molecules do in complex C. Conclusions Polymer II is a valuable industrial product which is produced by oxida- tive coupling of monomer I in the presence of catalysts containing copper salts and amines. During the course of oxidative coupling, the formation of side-product III is possible which impairs the properties of the polymer. Therefore, it is important to find ways to increase catalytic selectivity towards formation of II. It has long been known that a high amine-to-copper ratio promotes formation of II, while a low ratio promotes formation of III. Conditions providing a relatively high yield of II were chosen empirically. However, insufficient knowledge of the mechanistic details of the process slowed advances in this direction. The data presented in this paper allows clarification of certain correlations between the structure of copper complexes and the direction of oxidative coupling of I. The EPR and NMR methods have made possible the elucidation of the following reaction steps: (1) Formation, prior to exposing the catalysts to monomer I, of the starting complexes A with the idealized structure as suggested in Fig. 2. (2) Rapidly equilibrated substitution in complexes A of a 2,6-dimethyl- phenol molecule for a Py or Pipe molecule upon exposing the catalyst solution to monomer I (formation of complex B). (3) Substitution in complex A of phenolate ion for acetate or formate ion (formation of equilibrated mixture of complexes C and C' from complex A via reaction (1)). (4) Electron transfer from the phenolate ion to the Cu(II) atom in complexes C and/or C' (but not from the phenol molecules in complexes B), resulting in reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) and formation of phenoxy radical (reaction (2)). (5) Reoxidation of the newly formed Cu(I) complexes via reaction (3). (6) Gradual formation during the course of the reaction of new Cu(II) complexes involving the products of oxidative coupling of I (complexes of the D and E types). The data obtained suggest that complexes C (and/or C'), D and E serve as catalytically active species, while complexes A and B are precursors of these species. They also suggest that, for the studied catalytic systems in the steady-state regime, electron transfer reaction (2) is the rate-determining step of the overall process. 350 The change in composition of the coordination sphere of starting copper complexes (i.e. complexes which are formed prior to substitution of the phenolate ion for the acetate or formate ion via reaction (1)) for the pyridine-containing systems is determined by the [I]/[Py] ratio, rather than by the [Py]/[Cu(II)l ratio. The difference in direction of oxidative coupling of I observed for catalytic systems with different amine-to-copper ratios arises during substitu- tion of the phenolate ion for the acetate ion. At a low amine-to-copper ratio, the equilibrium concentration of complexes C containing the phenolate ion in their coordination sphere is small, while at a high amine-to-copper ratio it is large. For this reason, at a low amine-to-copper ratio the recombination of free phenoxy radicals leading to the formation of side-product III via reac- tion (7) seems to prevail, while at a high amine-to-copper ratio the interac- tion between the free phenoxy radical and phenolate ions in Cu(II) complexes leading to the formation of the polymer product II via reaction (8) becomes predominant. Our investigation has established that the selectivity towards formation of II tends to increase during the catalytic process. It seemed logical to suppose that the increase in selectivity is due to changes in the structure of the catalytically active complex. Support for this assumption comes from the observation of the transformation of complex C to complex D in the system containing Pipe as amine. The complex D formed appears to have a tetrahedral structure and involve oligomeric ligands which are formed in the course of the reaction (see Fig. 2). In this case the decrease in the yield of side-product III may be caused by the fact that in complex D electron transfer to the copper atom occurs predominantly from the oligomeric ligand, which is a stronger electron donor than the monomeric ligand. As a result, the yield of monomeric phenoxy radical-precursors of III tends to decrease, and the selectivity towards formation of the desired polymeric product II tends to increase. References 1 A.

The rate-determining step of oxidative coupling in steady-state conditions seems to be electron transfer from phenolate ions to the Cu(II) atom in these complexes. The selectivity is enhanced at high concentrations of these complexes, since in these conditions the monomeric phenoxyl radicals formed in the reaction mixture react mainly with coordinated phenolate and polyphenolate ligands to yield finally II, rather than recombining to form 3,3',5,5'-tetramethyldiphenoquinone, III, which is the main side product of the reaction. Complexes with oligomeric phenolate ligands seem to provide better selectivity than complexes with monomeric ones, since for the former complexes intramolecular electron transfer does not produce the monomeric phenol radicals necessary to make compound III.
