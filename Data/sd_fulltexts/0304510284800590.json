Box 513, 5600 MB Eindhoven (The Netherlands) Summary Careful preparation of Rh/A^Oa catalysts leads to ultradisperse systems (H/Rh > 1.0). Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) shows that these catalysts are almost completely oxidized during passivation. Identical prepa- ration of Rh/TiO; catalysts leads to less disperse systems (H/Rh = 0.3), which exhibit two reduction peaks in TPR. These peaks are due to the reduction of small, well-dispersed Rh^Oa particles and of large, bulk-like Rh^Oa particles. In all cases reduction of Rh^O^ is complete above 450 K. TiOa is partly reduced by a metal-catalysed process above 500 K. Introduction Over the past years it has become clear that rhodium catalysts occupy a special position in the field of supported transition metal catalysts, because they are able to produce hydrocarbons as well as oxygenated products (alcohols, aldehydes, acids) from synthesis gas [1 -10]. Various workers have tried to influence the selectivity and activity of the rhodium catalysts via special preparation [1, 2], additives [3 - 5] or mixed oxides [8 -10], and where this succeeded at least two groups gave as the reason the presence of stabilized Rh\"1\" on the surface [8, 10]. Some authors claimed the presence of isolated Rh\"'\" sites in mono- metallic Rh catalysts on the basis of IR evidence (Worley et al. [11 -13], Primet [14]), while others using electron microscopy found the Rh to be present as metallic rafts (Yates et al. [15]). In all cases it seems obvious that the support plays an important role in either bringing or keeping the metal in a certain state of (non-)reactivity. A special example of such a metal-support interaction was discovered by Tauster et al. [16,17] and is now known as Strong Metal-Support Inter- action (SMSI): Supported metals such as Pt and Rh lose their capability for chemisorption of H;, CO and NO if they have been reduced at high * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Ekevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 368 temperatures (e.g. 773 K) on supports such as TiO; and ^03. Normal chemisorption behaviour can be restored by oxidation at elevated tempera- tures, followed by low-temperature reduction, at for instance 473 K [16]. SMSI has been related to the occurrence of lower oxides of the support [18, 19], but the exact nature of the interaction still remains unclear. Many of the above-mentioned phenomena involve one common prop- erty: The oxidation-reduction behaviour of supported Rh catalysts. We decided to study two systems, representative of many of those referred to above: 2.3 wt.% Rh/A^Oa and 3.2 wt.% Rh/TiC^. Via sintering (see Experi- mental) we have induced a variation in particle size (dispersion) in order to examine the following questions: (i) How is oxidation-reduction influenced by particle size? (ii) Does particle size show any effect upon SMSI? Before discussing the experimental techniques, we must introduce one last item: passivation. Since it is obvious that reduced systems cannot simply be stored in air, we passivate and stabilize them by applying a layer of oxy- gen on the metal particles in a controlled manner (see Experimental). Some authors have already examined the state of the catalysts after storage in air. Burwell Jr. et al. have used Wide Angle X-ray Scattering, Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS), hydrogen chemisorption and hydro- gen-oxygen titration to characterize their supported Pt and Pd catalysts [20-23]. We will show that good insight in these matters can be gained via Temperature Programmed Reduction and Oxidation (TPR and TPO), sup- ported by chemisorption measurements. TPR as a characterization technique was presented by Jenkins et al. in 1975 [24, 25] and has been used exten- sively in the past few years, as is seen from a recent review by Hurst et al. [26]. The technique allows one to obtain (semi)quantitative information on the rate and ease of reduction of all kinds of systems; once the apparatus has been built, analyses are fast and relatively cheap. We used an apparatus as described by Boer et al. [27], which enabled us to extend the analyses to TPO, and thus gather information about the rate and ease of oxidation as well. Experimental TiO; (anatase, Tioxide Ltd, CLDD 1367, surface area 20 m2 g\"1, pore volume 0.5 cm3 g~1) and J-A\\^O^ (Ketjen, 000-1.5E, surface area 200 m2 g~1, pore volume 0.6 cm3 g~1) were impregnated with an aqueous solution of RhC^-xHzO via the incipient wetness technique to prepare a 2.3 wt.% Rh/Al203 and a 3.2 wt.% Rh/TiO; catalyst, as was established spectro- photometrically. The catalysts were dried in air at 355, 375 and 395 K for 2 h successively, followed by direct (pre)-reduction in flowing H2 at 473, 773 or 973 K for 1 h. Prior to removal from the reduction reactor, the catalysts were passivated at room temperature by replacing the H2 flow 369 H, Ar 0, He Programmer Oven Vent. TCD Dryer Fig. 1. Schematic representation of TPR-TPO apparatus. with N3, and subsequently slowly adding up to 20% O;. The catalysts were then taken out of the reactor and stored for further use. The TRP/TPO apparatus used is schematically represented in Fig. 1: a 5% Ha-in-Ar or a 5% O^-in-He flow (300 ml h~1) can be directed through a microreactor. The temperature of the reactor can be raised or lowered via linear programming. H; or 0^ consumption is monitored continuously by means of a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), A typical reactor sequence is as follows (a similar sequence is fol- lowed during TPO): the passivated or oxidized sample is flushed under Ar flow at 223 K; Ar is replaced by the Ar/H; mixture, causing at least an apparent H; consumption (first switch peak); the sample is heated under Ar/H; flow at a rate of 5 K min~1 to 873 K; after 15 min at 873 K, the sample is cooled down at 10 K min~1 to 233 K; the reduced sample is flushed with Ar; Ar flow is replaced by the Ar/H; mixture once more, now causing only an apparent H; consumption (second switch peak). The switch peak procedure deserves some closer attention. The strong signal we call the first switch peak is mainly due to the displacement of Ar by Ar/H; in the reactor, but in some cases real hydrogen consumption takes place, even at 223 K. Therefore we repeat the whole procedure after the TPR has been performed, when the catalyst has been reduced and cooled down to 223 K, and as a consequence is covered by hydrogen. Then we replace the Ar/Ha by pure Ar, resulting in a negative TCD signal. Subse- quently we switch back to Ar/H;. Since we do not expect any hydrogen consumption from the reduced hydrogen-covered sample at this time, the resulting second switch peak will be due solely to the displacement of Ar by Ar/Hz. Thus the difference between the first and second switch peaks reveals the real hydrogen consumption at 233 K, if there is any. The reactions that might take place during TPO and TPR are: 4 Rh + 302 > 2Rh203 (O^/Rh = 0.75) RhaOa + 3H; > 2Rh + 3H20 (Hs/Rh = 1.50) 370 TABLE 1 Hydrogen chemisorption of Rh/Al^O-s (RA) and Rh/TiO, (RT) catalysts.

Chemisorption measurements were carried out in a conventional volumetric glass apparatus after reduction of the passivated catalysts at 473 or 773 K in flowing H; for 1 h, followed by evacuation at 473 K for 1 h. After Hz admission at 473 K, desorption isotherms were measured at room temperature. As desorption became noticeable only at pressures below 200 torr, we believe that the chemisorption value above that pressure is repre- sentative of monolayer coverage (cf. Crucq et al. [28]). The H/Rh values thus obtained for the various systems are presented in Table 1. Results Hydrogen chemisorption The hydrogen chemisorption data as given in Table 1 were obtained for Rh/AlzOa (RA) after reduction of the passivated catalyst at 473 K only, and for Rh/TiOz(RT) also after reduction of the passivated catalyst at 1.0 Temp.pre-red.(K) Fig. 2.

The catalysts will be denoted hereafter as RA 773 (Rh/Al^Oa, pre-reduced at 773 K), RT 973 (Rh/TiO;, pre-reduced at 973 K), etc. The results are represented graphically in Fig. 2, showing the values of H/Rh as a function of pre-reduction temperature (i.e. reduction prior to passivation; reduction prior to chemisorption was at either 473 or 773 K, as indicated). Values for Rh/A^ range from 1.70 to 1.00, for non- SMS1 Rh/TiO; from 0.37 to 0.12 and for SMSI Rh/Ti02 from 0.10 to 0.01.

RA 773 shows a single consumption peak around 273 K, followed by desorption of H;. The pre-reduction had apparently been complete, and passivation of this ultradisperse Rh catalyst had led to dissociative oxygen chemisorption, but not full oxidation, since the net Ha consumption amounted to 1.0 H^/Rh. Apparently the pre-reduction at 473 K of RA 473 had not been complete, and the oxygen chemisorbed on this system was harder to remove than from the others (RA 973 showed a TPR profile identical to that of RA 773). The subsequent TPO, Fig. 3c, whose profiles were identical for all three systems, confirms these observations: O; consumption begins at 223 K, in the 'switch peak', continues when the temperature climb is started, reaches a maximum around 290 K, and then decreases very slowly towards higher temperatures. Integration of the 02 consumption signal proved difficult, due to the small sample sizes (typically 50 - 75 Jumol of metal) and the small thermal conductivity of 0^, but still amounted to a rather satisfying 0.6 - 0.7 Oz/Rh (0.75 was expected, since chemisorbed H2 was removed by heat treatment between TPR and TPO). The similarity of the TPO profiles of RA 473, RA 773 and RA 973 is in accordance with the fact that all these catalysts have been brought up to 873 K during the TPR run; it is not surprising to find that the TPR profiles of the completely oxidized systems (following TPO) are also identical (Fig. 3d). One single peak is observed around 360 K, corresponding to a hydrogen consumption of about 1.5 H2/Rh, which agrees with the reduction of Rh203. Unsupported bulk Rh203 showed a reduction peak at 400 K in our apparatus, while oxidation of bulk Rh metal was only initiated above 870 K. TPR and TPO of Rh/TiO^ The TPR profile for the passivated RT 473 catalyst is shown in Fig. 4a. Its most striking feature is that the H2 consumption already starts at 223 K in the 'switch peak', that is, as soon as H2/Ar is flushed through the reactor. Keeping in mind the much lower H/Rh value of this catalyst compared to the Rh/Al203 series, we conclude that passivation here has caused only the formation of an outer layer of oxide on the relatively large metal particles. If the remaining metallic core could be reached by the hydrogen molecules, these molecules could dissociate and provide atomic hydrogen for easy reduction of the oxide layer at low temperatures. There is also some hydro- gen consumption just above 473 K, as occurred for the corresponding Rh/Al203 catalyst, indicating that also for Rh/TiO; the pre-reduction at 473 K was not complete. It is evident that the Ti02 support can also be reduced, leading to H2 consumption around 573 and 700 K. The H2 con- sumption at 223 K amounts to about 0.4 H2/Rh. The TPR profiles for RT 773 and RT 973 are similar, but since the Rh surface area decreases with increasing pre-reduction temperature (cf. Table 1) the amount of passivation oxygen also decreases, and thus so does 373 673 T(K) Fig. 4. 3.2 wt.% Rh/TiOi catalyst: (a) TPR of passivated catalyst, prereduced at 473 K; (b) TPO following TPR of catalyst prereduced at either 473, 773 or 973 K; (c) TPR following TPO of catalyst prereduced at either 473, 773 or 973 K. the Ha consumption at 223 K in the TPR profiles. The consumption just above 473 K has also disappeared as a consequence of the higher pre-reduc- tion temperature. Figure 4b shows the TPO profile of the reduced RT catalyst. The three TPO profiles of RT 473, 773 and 973 are alike: three 'areas' of oxygen consumption appear, which we attribute respectively to chemisorption (which is the only phenomenon on Rh/Al203), corrosive chemisorption and complete oxidation. We will come back to these assignments in the subsequent Discussion. The TPR profiles of the oxidized samples of the RT series are again identical (Fig. 4c) and show two clearly divided H; consumption maxima, at 325 and 385 K. Consumption in the first peak is about 1.3 Ha/Rh and in the second one about 0.3 H^/Rh. Taken together, the Ha consumptions are close enough to the expected value of 1.5 Ha/Rh to attribute them both to reduction of Rh203. Th- peak at 385 K is assigned to bulk-like Rh-fi^ particles (note that the peak maximum for unsupported Rh203 is at 400 K), and that at 325 K to a better-dispersed RhyOy phase. Furthermore, the 374 possibility of some support reduction taking place here as well, in advance of the support reduction around 573 and 700 K, cannot be excluded. Discussion Hydrogen chemisorption has been used through the years by many workers to characterize metal surfaces [7,9,10,14,16,20-23,29,30]; when attempts were made to calculate metal surface areas from hydrogen chemisorption data, a hydrogen-metal stoichiometry of one was used. On the other hand, if CO was involved, some authors [31] chose a stoichiometry of one, while others [14] mentioned higher stoichiometries. We feel that if it is accepted that a metal atom such as Rh can adsorb two or more CO molecules, then the idea of the same atom adsorbing more than one hydrogen atom should not be excluded. Thus although our experi- mental H/Rh results exceed unity, we think they are real (Table 1), and that the hydrogen chemisorbed does not exceed a monolayer (cf. Crucq et al. [28]), and is entirely bound to the metal. We did not try to distinguish between so-called 'reversible' and 'irreversible' adsorption, because we be- lieve that in the thermodynamic sense there is no such distinction. In fol- lowing the procedures that lead to that supposed distinction, one merely encounters the physical restrictions of the experimental apparatus, such as pumping speed and conductivity of the capillary tubing [28]. As described in the Experimental Section, we admitted hydrogen at 473 K. This was done simply to accelerate adsorption and did not effect the ultimate amount of adsorption, as was verified by measuring the adsorp- tion isotherms at room temperature*. This leaves us with chemisorption values above unity, and therefore, like some other authors [21, 30], we find it impossible to calculate a particle size or a dispersion from these data, since there is no particular stoichiometry value to prefer. We imagine these Rh particles could be raft-like, as suggested by Yates et al. [15] (although they were dealing with only 0.5 wt.% Rh/A^Oa), where the edge atoms could have the possibility of adsorbing more than one H atom. 'Sintering' of these particles (H/Rh decreases from 1.7 to 1.0 upon reduction at 973 K) would then mean that the number of edge atoms decreases, for example by forming rafts or even (hemi)spherical particles. Still we are dealing with ultradispersed systems. We estimate that in all cases the Rh particle size does not exceed 10 A. For the RT series the H/Rh values as established after 473 K reduction are much lower, which was to be expected considering the difference in surface area between Al^Oy and TiO; and the similar metal loadings. Here also we see a decrease in the H/Rh values as a result of an increase in pre- reduction temperature. But in this case this is simply due to growth of the *With special thanks to Mr. A. M. L.

The H/Rh values after 773 K reduction show evidence for SMSI behaviour. The values are small, however, and of the order of magnitude of the experimental error. Therefore we cannot at this point draw any conclusion about a relationship between SMSI behaviour and particle size. We expected this to be difficult, since both particle growth and increasing SMSI behaviour lead to less hydro- gen chemisorption, and the limits of experimental accuracy might thus prohibit a distinction between the two effects. It is evident that RT 773 and RT 973 must have been in the SMSI state after pre-reduction, but they showed normal chemisorption behaviour after the passivation and re-reduction at 473 K in the chemisorption appara- tus. This means that the passivation, following the pre-reduction, must have destroyed the SMSI state. Our TPR and TPO results also prove that passivation is rather drastic. For small metal particles on A^Oa, TPR of the passivated samples differs from that of the oxidized ones only in the position of the peak, that is, in the ease of reduction. From the shape of the TPO pattern, we can deduce that the effect of a long passivation time (such as storage in air) approaches that of a real oxidation. But it is very clear that no matter what the initial state of the Rh, passivated or oxidized, reduction is complete above 400 K. Worley and coworkers studied the oxidation state of Rh on various supports, beginning with various Rh precursors, via IR absorption experi- ments after CO adsorption [11-13]. Apart from IR absorptions attributed to CO adsorbed on metallic Rh, some absorptions were found which were attributed to CO adsorbed on isolated Rh\"1\" sites. For 2.2 wt.% Rh catalysts, these isolated Rh\"1\" sites were found to be more abundant for A\\^0y than for TiO; as support [13], and more abundant for RhCl3 than for Rh(N03)3 as precursor [12, 13]. The authors concluded that the poorest reduction of Rh (their reductions were carried out at 673 K) occurs when using A1203 as a support and RhCl3 as a precursor. From the TPR evidence presented here, we conclude that the systems studied by Worley et al. must have been completely reduced prior to admission of CO, and therefore we prefer another explanation. The best dispersion of metallic Rh particles is obtained on A1203, and starting from RhCl3. Upon CO adsorption, the smaller parti- cles break up and create the isolated dicarbonyl species that were attributed to Rh'1\"1 by Worley et al. EXAFS proof for this explanation is published elsewhere [32]. Our findings for Rh/TiOa agree very well with the results published by Burwell et al. for Pd and Pt on SiO; and A1203 [20 - 23]. Upon passivation, the larger metal particles create an oxide 'skin', the formation of which can almost literally be seen in the TPO of Rh/TiO; (Fig. 4b). The small metal particles on A1203 show only one tailing chemisorption peak, but for Rh/TiOz oxygen chemisorption is followed at higher temperatures by corrosive chemisorption and finally, around 700 K, by complete oxidation. Apparently oxygen diffusion through the oxide layer is a strongly hindered process. Attribution of the intermediate temperature region of oxidation 376 673 T(K) Fig. 5. (a) TPO of a reduced 3.0 wt.% Rh/SiO^ catalyst; (b) TPO up to 673 K of a re- duced 3.2 wt.% Rh/TiOz catalyst; (c) subsequent TPR. to corrosive chemisorption is supported by our TPO results using 3 wt.% Rh/Si02 (Grace Silica, S.P. 2.-324, 382, 290 m2 g~1), shown in Fig. 5a. This TPO exhibits two oxygen consumption areas, one around 273 K which is due to oxygen chemisorption, and one around 500 K due to corrosive chemisorption. All of the Rh on SiO; is in a well-dispersed form (H/Rh = 0.4), as was confirmed by the subsequent TPR of this Rh/SiQi catalyst, which showed only one Hz consumption maximum at 335 K. This peak cor- responds to that of the first reduction peak observed for Rh/TiO^ at 325 K (cf. Results). The oxidation peak around 700 K in the TPO of Rh/TiO; is attributed to the formation of rather large, bulk-like Rh203 particles whose reduction is observed as a separate H; consumption maximum at 385 K in the TPR (Fig. 4c). That the large particles both oxidize and reduce at a higher tempera- ture than the small particles has been proven by a rather simple experiment, shown in Fig. 5b and c. The TPO is first run with a reduced Rh/TiO; system up to 673 K. Subsequently TPR is performed which demonstrates that the reduction peak at 385 K has completely disappeared. Thus the fraction of Rh which reduces at 385 K oxidizes above 673 K, and vice versa. That one can distinguish between a well-dispersed phase and a bulk- like phase of Rh^Oa on TiO; has been noted before by Yao et al. [33], although these authors used Al^O^ as a support and had to oxidize for 12 h at 973 K to create the bulk phase. 377 The fact that part of the TiO; support is being reduced as well, in a metal-assisted process, is in agreement with findings for Pt/TiOs [34,35]. Reoxidation of the support does take place during TPO, since O; consump- tion exceeds the expected 0^/Rh value of 0.75 in all cases, but is apparently hidden in the TPO profile by the stronger 03 consumption due to the Rh oxidation. Conclusions The 2.3 wt.% Rh/Al203 catalyst proved to be ultradisperse, with H/Rh values ranging between 1.7 and 1.0. The catalyst behaved accordingly in TPR and TPO: easy reduction and rapid oxidation were observed to such an extent that passivation led to almost complete oxidation. The 3.2 wt.% Rh/TiO; catalyst was much less disperse (H/Rh 0.37 - 0.12) and showed evidence of two distinct forms of Rh (and Rl^Oa), ap- pearing as two reduction peaks in TPR (reductions of well-dispersed and bulk-like Rh^) and three oxidation areas in TPO (oxygen chemisorption and oxidative chemisorption of well-dispersed Rh, and complete oxidation of bulk-like Rh). Investigation was begun of the influence of particle size upon oxida- tion-reduction behaviour, but we were not able yet to establish a relation- ship between SMSI behaviour and particle size. All Rh/Ti02 samples could be brought into the SMSI state. We shall continue this search by varying the dispersion, the metal content and the reduction procedure. This investigation has shown unambiguously that the TPR-TPO tech- nique is a very powerful tool for distinguishing the various ways in which oxygen can react with a metal, and thus allows a careful analysis to be made of the state of dispersion of the metal on the catalyst.

Box 513, 5600 MB EindhovenThe Netherlands 1 Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. Careful preparation of Rh/Al2O3 catalysts leads to ultradisperse systems (H/Rh > 1.0). Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) shows that these catalysts are almost completely oxidized during passivation. Identical preparation of Rh/TiO2 catalysts leads to less disperse systems (H/Rh = 0.3), which exhibit two reduction peaks in TPR. These peaks are due to the reduction of small, well-dispersed Rh2O3 particles and of large, bulk-like Rh2O3 particles. In all cases reduction of Rh2O3 is complete above 450 K. TiO2 is partly reduced by a metal-catalysed process above 500 K. References 1 M. Ichikawa Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 51 1978 2268 2 M. Ichikawa Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 51 1978 2273 3 E.I. Leupold, H.-J.
