Rational design of cost-effective high-performance electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance for electrochemical water splitting. Herein, we adopt a nitrogen doping method to fabricate self-supported N-doped CoO nanowire arrays (N–CoO) as active electrocatalysts via a facile hydrothermal combined doping method. The N–CoO nanowires are strongly composited with the carbon cloth substrate forming free-standing electrode with reinforced stability and high electronic conductivity. Owing to the increased accessible and electroactive areas, rich/short pathways for charge transfer and enhanced electronic conductivity, the N–CoO electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for OER with a low overpotential (319 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 410 mV at 100 mA cm−2) and a low Tafel slope of 74 mV dec−1 as well as superior long-term stability with no decay in 24 h continuous test in alkaline solution. Our reported design and optimization strategy provide a promising way to construct interesting well-aligned arrays for application in energy storage and conversion.

Keywords Oxygen evolution reaction Nanowires Electrocatalysis Porous structure Cobalt Oxides 1 Introduction It is critical to develop green technology for energy storage and conversion with the urgent need for the sustainable development of society [1,2]. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as a necessary procedure of various devices including water splitting and rechargeable metal-air batteries, has attracted considerable attention and been investigated for the past decades [3–6]. Generally, the OER depends heavily on high-performance electrocatalysts, which can reduce its high overpotential and improve reaction kinetics [7,8]. Currently, iridium/ruthenium oxides (IrO2/RuO2) are taken as the most promising catalysts for OER [9]. However, their scarcity, expensive price and compromised stability prohibit their wide application [10,11]. As a result, it is desirable to explore efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts for OER catalysis. It is widely recognized that materials based on the transition metal composites, including metal oxides [12–16], sulfides [17,18], phosphides [19,20], nitrides [21,22] and selenides [23,24], are the most promising alternatives owing to their high electrocatalytic performance and excellent electrochemical stability for OER. Of these candidates, cobalt oxides spark intense great interest for OER catalysis owing to their facile preparation and high theoretically electrocatalytic activity [25–27]. Despite the CoO is endowed with these advantages, it is still hard for the bulk CoO to achieve ideal catalytic performance because of its poor conductivity and limited active sites. Therefore, various measures, including compositing with conductive substrates (e.g., carbon nanotubes, graphene, graphene oxides, Au), directional nanostructuring and doping with heteroatoms, have been taken on CoO to facilitate reaction kinetics and enhance electroactive areas resulting in higher activity. For instance, Bell's group [28] developed cobalt oxides deposited on Au, which exhibited the turnover frequency 40 times higher than that of the bulk cobalt oxides. Zhao and coworkers [29] synthesized an active electrocatalysts composed of porous graphene and cobalt oxide, which showed large specific accessible surface area and fast electron transport, exhibiting enhanced electrocatalytic performance for OER with a low overpotential (348 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and high current density. Nevertheless, the catalytic activities towards OER of aforementioned materials are still restricted. It is difficult for the catalysts without well-aligned arrays to sufficiently exhibit their catalytic activities because the agglomeration and the collapse of the nanostructure might cover active sites and block the contact with electrolyte. On the contrary, free-standing nanowire arrays can make full use of exposed electroactive areas and improve electronic conductivity via increasing accessible contact with electrolyte in the open framework to promote electrocatalytic performance towards OER. Furthermore, nanowires can provide short and rich pathways along with the radial direction and fast electron transport along the axial direction to reduce resistance and accelerate the kinetics effectively. In this work, we adopt a nitrogen dopant strategy to design N-doped CoO nanowire arrays (N–CoO) as interesting electrocatalysts towards OER in alkaline solution via a facile hydrothermal combined doping synthesis method. Arising from the enhanced electroactive areas, improved electrical conductivity and close combination with substrate, the designed N–CoO nanowire arrays display excellent electrocatalytic performance for OER with a low overpotential (319 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 410 mV at 100 mA cm−2) and a low Tafel slope of 74 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH solution. In addition, the N–CoO nanowire arrays exhibit remarkable long-term durability with no decay after 24 h continuous test. Our rational construction and optimization method may open up a new door for designing advanced transition-metal-based electrocatalysts for OER. 2 Experimental Well-aligned Co2(OH)2CO3 nanowires arrays were fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method. For the first step, 0.01 mol of Co(NO3)2, 0.02 mol NH4F and 0.05 mol of CO(NH2)2 were directly dissolved in 70 mL deionized water. After stirring violently, a piece of carbon cloth (2 cm × 3 cm) was directly immersed into the above homogeneous solution as a substrate in a Teflon-linked steel autoclave and heated to 120 °C for 8 h. After naturally cooling, the obtained Co2(OH)2CO3 nanowire arrays were washed by deionized water and dried at 60 °C overnight. Then, the precursor was put into a quartz tube inside a horizontal tube furnace, where it was annealed at 550 °C in Ar atmosphere (100 sccm) for 2 h to form CoO nanowire arrays. Finally, the as-obtained CoO nanowire arrays were heated to 300 °C under NH3 atmosphere (50 sccm), staying at the peak temperature for 2 h to obtain N-doped CoO nanowire arrays. Morphologies and microstructures of CoO and N–CoO were characterized by utilizing a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi SU8010) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM 2100F). The crystal structure was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) reactor using Cu K α radiation (RigakuD/Max-2550). To confirm the chemical composition and valence state of samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific ESCALAB_250Xi) with Al K α source at 1486.6 eV. The OER performances of all samples were monitored via an electrochemical workstation (CH Instrument 660D) with a standard three-electrode configuration at room temperature, where platinum foil and standard Hg/HgO-1 electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The as-obtained samples with the sizes of 1 cm2 were directly used as the working electrodes and 1 M KOH solution was used as electrolyte. These tests were also facilitated by NEWARE system. All potentials for analysis were referred to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The conversion of E(RHE) can be obtained according to the equation E(RHE) = E(Hg/HgO) + 0.9254. Twenty cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) were firstly performed at the scan rate of 50 mV s−1 to get steady current. Then the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves are conducted at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in the potential range of 0 V to 1 V vs. Hg/HgO electrode. The Tafel plots were derived from LSV curves at the scan rate of 1 mV s−1. Meanwhile, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were accomplished at the same polarization voltage of each sample consistent with the current density of around 10 mA cm−2, within the frequency scope from 0.01 Hz to 1,000,000 Hz. The CV curves were obtained at different scan rates of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 mV s−1 to get C dl values and the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA) were linearly proportional to the C dl values, equaling to half of the slope value. The long-term stability test was performed at the constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 24 h each. 3 Results and discussion Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed to monitor the morphology difference of the as-obtained samples. Fig. 1 (a) and (b) shows well-aligned Co2(OH)2CO3 nanowire arrays with a smooth texture via a facile hydrothermal method. Upon thermal treatment, uniform CoO nanowires of 60–110 nm are grown tightly and quasi-vertically onto the carbon cloth fiber (Fig. 1(c)). These nanowires exhibit a rough appearance and develop independently with nearly no mutual interfaces, showing a three-dimensional (3D) porous structure. The open structure of CoO nanowire arrays is beneficial for the penetration of electrolyte and ensure timely release of the oxygen bubbles during the reaction. As for a single CoO nanowire (Fig. 1(d)), notice that it is assembled by cross-linked numerous secondary nanoparticles with diameters of 10–40 nm as primary building blocks. As for N–CoO nanowires clearly shown in Fig. 1(e) and (f), the morphology shows almost no difference compared to the unmodified CoO nanowires, maintaining highly porous open structure. It indicates that the N doping strategy via annealing in ammonia atmosphere is able to well retain the morphology without damage. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were characterized to further analyze the evolution of detailed microstructures and phase for the as-prepared samples. Fig. 2 (a) displays the typical TEM image of the CoO nanowire with rough texture and a mesoporous structure, which is composed of numerous interconnected nanoparticles verifying the porous morphology shown in SEM images above. The CoO phase with a well crystalline nature is identified through the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image. The diffraction spots are well indexed with the planes of (111), (220) and (200), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the measured lattice spacing is around 0.24 nm, which is corresponding to the (111) plane of CoO phase (JCPDS 09-0402). Compared to CoO nanowires, the microstructure of N–CoO nanowires does not change much and retain porous structure. Apparently, the diffraction spots in SAED pattern (inset of Fig. 2(c)) also match well with the (111), (220) and (200) planes of CoO (JCPDS 09-0402). The measured lattice spacing in Fig. 2(d) is about 0.24 nm, which is corresponding to the (111) plane of CoO, indicating no distinct increase after N doping. In addition, the uniformity of the N–CoO composite is confirmed by EDS elemental images (Fig. 2(e)). Presence and uniform distribution of Co, O and N are detected in the N–CoO nanowire, suggesting the successful homogeneous nitrogen doping in the CoO nanowire. In order to clarify further insights into the crystallographic structure and composition of the samples, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were analyzed in Fig. 3 . The XRD pattern of the Co2(OH)2CO3 is shown in Fig. 3(a), confirming the successful formation of the precursor. All the diffraction peaks at 36.5°, 42.2°, 61.5°, 73.7° and 77.6° are indexed to the planes of (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) of CoO (JCPDS 09-0402) [30], respectively, except for the peaks of carbon cloth substrate (Fig. 3(b)). Upon thermal treatment in NH3, the N–CoO nanowire arrays still maintain typical diffraction peaks of CoO phase, suggesting that the doping of nitrogen atoms does not change the phase of samples. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the XPS survey spectrum demonstrates the presence of Co, O in CoO and Co, O and N in N–CoO, in agreement with the results shown in EDS elemental mapping above. The inconspicuous peak belonging to nitrogen is due to a small amount of N dopant. Fig. 3(d) displays the high-resolution Co 2p region of CoO and N–CoO. As for CoO, a main peak at 780.3 eV is assigned to Co 2p 3/2, while a relative weaker peak at 796.1 eV is characteristic for Co 2p 1/2. The evident satellite peaks of Co 2p 1/2 and Co 2p 3/2 are identified at 802.1 eV and 785.6 eV, respectively, which are in accordance with the reported data of CoO nanocrystals [31]. In the meantime, the ratio of Co 2p 1/2 satellite peak intensity to its main peak is about 0.92 calculated from the area of XPS spectrum of Co 2p, in good accordance with value observed in cubic CoO [32]. The Co 2p pattern of N–CoO possesses two typical core peaks of Co 2p 3/2 (796.3 eV) and Co 2p 1/2 (780.5 eV) as well as two satellite peaks. The area of Co 2p 1/2 satellite peak is also about 0.92 times as large as that of Co 2p 1/2 peak, suggesting the same chemical state of Co in N–CoO. In addition, a slight positive shift of the two core levels of Co 2p 3/2 and Co 2p 1/2 compared to CoO indicates the successful formation of N-doped CoO. Meanwhile, the above statement is also supported by O 1s spectrum (Fig. 3(e)). The peak at 529.8 eV corresponds to O 1s peak of CoO from the Co–O bond and there is a hump on the side of the main peak which originates from –OH at 531.3 eV [31,33]. As comparison, the peak at 529.6 eV is associated to O 1s peak of N–CoO and the weaker peak locating at 531.2 eV corresponds to –OH. The existence of N is verified by XPS analysis in Fig. 3(f). The N 1s peak consists of two main peaks. The weaker one at about 397.4 eV attributes to N–Co bond and the one at 399.8 eV with high intensity arises from N–Co–O bond [34]. The electrocatalytic performance of CoO and N–CoO for OER was thoroughly conducted via a typical three-electrode configuration in 1 M KOH solution. The catalytic properties of CoO and N–CoO for OER are firstly investigated via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 (Fig. 4 (a)). It is obvious that the N–CoO nanowire arrays display more efficient catalytic performance for OER with low overpotentials of 319 mV and 410 mV (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, much superior to the CoO nanowire arrays counterpart (461 mV and 773 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively). The Tafel plots, derived from LSV curves at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1, are able to prove the better catalytic properties of NCoO (Fig. 4(b)). Significantly, the N–CoO also exhibits lower Tafel plot of 74 mV dec−1, much lower than the CoO arrays (107 mV dec−1), indicating its faster kinetic process for OER. In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is presented in Fig. 4(c) to reveal the electrochemical behaviors of the as-prepared samples during OER process. The smaller circle diameter of the N–CoO electrode demonstrates lower charge transfer resistance (R ct), suggesting that it possesses faster charge transfer and electrochemical reaction kinetics for OER. To deepen the understanding of improved catalytic activity for OER, the electrochemical active surface areas (ECSA) of the two samples are calculated from the electrochemical double-layer capacitances (C dl) based on the cycling voltammograms (CVs) at various scan rates (Fig. 5 ). The estimated current densities are plotted as functions with various scan rates. Then the ECSA values are regarded as the half of the slope value. Notably, the ECSA value of N–CoO electrode is up to 8.2 mF cm−2, around twice larger than the CoO electrode (3.8 mF cm−2), suggesting the remarkably enhanced active areas after N doping. The N doping nearly makes no difference to the morphology and nanostructure of the samples, but increases their electrochemical active areas greatly, inferring that the N doping strategy may play an important role in activating more active sites. Moreover, the rational design of N–CoO nanowire arrays provides considerable benefits for the enhancement of electrocatalytic properties for OER. (1) Direct growth of N–CoO nanowires on the carbon cloth substrate enhances high electrical conductivity and ensures abundant reaction sites without use of insulating polymer binders. (2) The N–CoO arrays with porous structure provide more active areas and sufficient contact with electrolyte, facilitating ion diffusion remarkably. Open porous framework of N–CoO nanowire arrays benefits the penetration of electrolyte and promotes the timely release of oxygen bubbles. (3) The N–CoO nanowires provide fast electron transport pathways along the radial direction and short ion diffusion length along the axial direction in virtue of carbon cloth fiber, accelerating the charge transfer and reducing the resistance efficiently thus leading to faster kinetics for OER. Meanwhile, the N doping also enhances the electronic conductivity and active areas notably. Furthermore, the long-term stability was evaluated via chronopotentiometry measurements carried out at 10 mA cm−2 for 24 h. Note that the N–CoO arrays exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity and more stable cycling properties than the CoO. To sum up, the N–CoO arrays are advanced electrocatalysts with better electrocatalytic performance for OER and excellent durability in alkaline solution. Our work shows a new way to design efficient catalysts based on porous nanowires for electrocatalysis. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, we have constructed N–CoO nanowire arrays as efficient electrocatalysts towards OER by combined strategies with rational arrays design and N doping strategy. The as-prepared N–CoO nanowire arrays possess open framework and porous nanostructure, demonstrating increased accessible contact and active areas and rich/short pathways for electron/ion transfer. Hence, the N–CoO electrode shows excellent electrocatalytic performance for OER with a low overpotential (319 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 410 mV at 100 mA cm−2) and a low Tafel slope of 74 mV dec−1 as well as superior long-term durability for 24 h in 1 M KOH solution. It can be safely concluded that the porous nanowire structure and N doping strategies are favorable to greatly improve the catalytic activity of OER.
