Graphical abstract In2O3 particles were successfully loaded on CoP and formed an type I heterojunction. Due to the load of In2O3, the light capture ability of CoP is greatly enhanced, and the utilization rate of visible light by CoP is improved, and photocatalytic hydrogen production activity was further increased. Non-noble metal phosphorescent catalysts have attracted people's attention because of their cheap advantages and good photocatalytic efficiency. In this paper, proposed a CoP/In2O3 composite catalyst that performs well in hydrogen production. The total amount of hydrogen released of CoP/In2O3 composite catalyst which sensitized by Eosin Y (EY) after 5 h exposure to visible light reached 251.87 μmol, which was three times that of pure CoP under the same conditions. The composite catalyst CoP/In2O3 can be prepared by physically mixing CoP and In2O3 which just need one step. Among them, the Co-MOF (ZIF-9) is used as the precursor to prepare CoP by phosphating method, which maintains the framework structure of Co-MOF. In the CoP/In2O3 composite catalyst, the In2O3 particles as co-catalyst are tightly attached to the CoP surface, which improves the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs. Subsequent photoelectrochemical experiments also proved the improvement of charge transfer efficiency. A multitude of characterization techniques such as XRD, SEM, XPS, BET, etc. were also performed on the prepared samples. Keywords Photocatalysis In2O3 Dye-sensitized Hydrogen production 1 Introduction At the moment, pollution of the environment problem increasingly serious. The extensive use of fossil fuels will lead to the massive release of carbon dioxide, leading to global warming [1–5]. Therefore, a clean energy alternative to fossil fuels is needed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in order to protect our beautiful home. Hydrogen is a very excellent clean energy with the advantages of producing only H2O and zero pollution when burned, so that it is considered as one of the alternatives to fossil fuels in the future [6–9]. As a very good clean energy, hydrogen can be produced by semiconductor photocatalysis technology which can produce hydrogen without pollutionthe environment [10]. Much research has been done on semiconductor photocatalysis. In particular, the photocatalysis semiconductor catalysts has been strongly developed in the last 50 years and its areas of application include pollutant removal, CO2 photoreduction [11], N2 fixation [12] and water splitting to generate H2 [13]. In 1972, Honda and Fujishima discovered photochemical water separation on titanium dioxide electrodes [14]. Photocatalytic water splitting reaction usually has three main steps: (1) light-irradiated semiconductor materials absorb sunlight to form electron-holes pairs, (2) electron-hole pairs migrate to the surface of the semiconductor after being separated, and (3) electrons migrated to the surface react with water to produce hydrogen. Sacrificial reagents are often added for better separation of electron-hole pairs [1,15], which is used to be oxidized during the photocatalytic water splitting process to remove holes and promote H2 production. In general, the commonly used sacrificial reagents are lactic acid (LA), triethanolamine (TEOA), methanol, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), and so on [16–18]. In addition to sacrificial reagents, EY-sensitized semiconductors were also found to have high hydrogen evolution activity when exposed to visible light. This is due to EY-sensitized photocatalysts can strongly promote the separation of electron-hole pairs, thus improving the reducing power of semiconductor [19]. Transition metal phosphides are excellent promoters that can be used to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting, which include CoP [20], Ni2P [21], FeP [22], MoP [23], WP [24], and Fe2P [25] etc. Zhou et al. used transition metal phosphide of element Co for efficient water oxidation [26]. As a good substitute for precious metal transition metal phosphates, CoP has the advantages of low cost and simple preparation. This article prepare CoP also has a certain hydrogen production efficiency, good conduction band and valence band positions, and moderate band gap. In many articles, In2O3 as co-catalyst composite other photocatalysts are used to produce hydrogen [27,28], which band gap of In2O3 is 2.64 eV and it has an n-type semiconductor. Due to the aggregation problem of In2O3 itself, the active sites are reduced, andg hydrogen production efficiency is low [29]. Therefore, In2O3 is used as a co-catalyst to disperse on CoP to reduce the aggregation degree of In2O3 thus improve its dispersity and provide active sites to increase catalytic activity. This is because CoP which is prepared from ZIF-9 as a precursor and has a certain morphology that can provide a wide surface so that In2O3 will not gather but disperse on its surface. In SEM characterization, it can be observed that In2O3 is indeed evenly dispersed on CoP. In this study, CoP was successfully synthesized using ZIF-9 as the precursor. Then In2O3 as the co-catalyst and CoP as the main catalyst to synthesize CoP/In2O3 (CPIO). CoP/In2O3 composite catalyst which was prepared by a uncomplicated method of physically mixing. The photocatalytic hydrogenation properties of CoP, In2O3, and CoP/In2O3 were studied. CoP/In2O3 composite catalyst exhibited outstanding photocatalytic performance under EY-sensitization. The outcomes show that the photocatalytic performance of CoP and In2O3 complex is the best when the mass ratio is 1:0.1. Through a series of characterization, the specific sources of the photocatalytic performance of the composite catalysts are described. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials All reagents are of analytical grade and are not used for further purification. 2.2 Synthesis of In2O3 The indium oxide were synthesis according to a previous method with some modifications [30]. Firstly, required amounts of In(NO3)3·6H2O with total quantity of 0.007 mol were dissolved in 50 mL deionized water under magnetic stirring. After that, using a dropper to add a sufficient amount of NH3·H2O until there was no more precipitation. Subsequently, the resulting white slurry put in thermostat water bath to aged at 80 °C for 60 min. After that, the product was transferred to the centrifuge tube for centrifugal separation. The sediment were washed twice with deionized water and then washed twice with ethanol, and was dried for 5 h at 60 °C in a drying oven. Finally, transfer to a crucible lined with tin foil, heat it to 350 °C in a muffle furnace, the heating rate is 5 °C/min, and calcine in the muffle furnace for 3 h. Fig. 1 shows the production process. 2.3 Synthesis of Co-MOF The Co-MOF were synthesis according to a previous method with some modifications [34]. Firstly, required amounts of Co(NO3)2·6H2O with total quantity of 0.005 mol and Benzimidazole with total quantity of 0.01 mol were dissolved in 200 mL deionized water under magnetic stirring of 15 min. After that, add 25 mL NH3·H2O and continue to stir for 45 min. Then, transferred to a dark environment and let stand for precipitation. Finally, transferred to centrifuge tube for centrifugal separation to get the sediment. The sediment were washed three times with deionized water. 2.4 Synthesis of CoP 100 mg of as-obtained ZIF-9 and 1 g NaH2PO2 were mixed together used mortar and pestle. And then, placed into a porcelain boat with tinfoil cover. After that, it was heated to 300 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min under N2 atmosphere 2 h in tube furnace. Finally, the product after calcination is ground with a mortar and pestle, then transferred to a centrifuge tube, washed two times with deionized water and two times with ethanol. Fig. 2 shows the production process. 2.5 Synthesis of CoP/In2O3 The as-prepared CoP with total quantity of 1 g mixed with different quantity of indium oxide in ethanol under magnetic stirring of 1 h. And then, transferred to a thermostat water bath to allow the ethanol to evaporate completely at 80 °C. The sample synthesized with different quantity of indium oxide of 0.03 g, 0.05 g, 0.1 g, 0.2 g quantity were labelled as 3-CPIO, 5-CPIO, 10-CPIO and 20-CPIO, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the production process. 2.6 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) (HORIBA Scientific, France) was used to study the samples at 40 kV and 30 mA, and the scanning speed was 10°/min. The specific morphology and overall micro-structure of the catalysts were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).(SEM: JSM-6701 F, JEOL, TEM: FEI Tecnai TF20). The Uv–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was performed on all sample catalysts using the UV-2550 (Shimadzu) spectrometer. Use barium sulfate as a reference or background. The specific surface area of BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) was obtained by drawing N2 adsorption-desorption isothermal curves using a quantum instrument (ASAP 2460) in an environment of 77 K. Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy was performed using a FLUOROMAX-4 spectrophotometer at room temperature. 2.7 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiments Weigh 10 mg of the photocatalyst sample and 20 mg of EY into the sacrifice reagent (30 mL TEOA solution (15 vol%)). Before irradiation, ultrasound dispersion was executed for 30 min. 15 min before the experiment nitrogen was introduced into the system while the air component in the quartz bottle is completely replaced by nitrogen. The photocatalyst is suspension by magnetic stirring. The photocatalytic 5 W white light multi channel reaction system is a light source that simulates sunlight. The wavelength range of light source was >420 nm. The integrated intensity was 100 mW/cm2 and temperature of the reaction system was kept at room temperature. The hydrogen released from the reaction system is analyzed by gas chromatograph (Tianmei GC7900, TCD, 13Xcolumn, N2 as carrier). 2.8 Electrochemical measurements The sample catalysts were photoelectrochemical measured through an electrochemical analyzer (VersaStat4-400, Advanced measurement Technology, Inc). It uesd standard three electrode batteries. The electrolyte solution used was Na2SO4 (0.2 M). The light source is a 300 W xenon lamp and filters the light with a filter (λ ≥ 400 nm). The working electrode is made of 1 × 1.5 cm2 conductive glass. Disperse 5 mg of the sample to be tested in the solution (perfluorosulfonic acid : perfluorosulfonic acid = 1:9), spread it evenly on the conductive glass and dry it for later use. The reference electrode, the counter electrode and the working electrode are calomel electrode, metal platinum sheet, and the conductive glass coated with the sample prepared. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD analysis XRD analysis is a very significant characterization and analysis method for crystals. By comparing it with known XRD cards, it is possible to determine whether the prepared sample is correct or not, and also determine the crystallinity and purity of the test sample. Fig. 4 (a) displays the XRD drafts of In2O3 and CoP. The sample diffraction peaks of In2O3 at 2θ = 21.50°, 30.59°, 35.46°, 51.02°, and 60.67° are attributed to the (211), (222), (400), (440), and (622) crystal planes in standard cards of In2O3(PDF#6-416), respectively. All diffraction peaks of CoP, the typical peaks at 2θ = 31.6°, 35.3°, 36.2°, 46.2°, 48.2°, 52.3°, 56.0°, 56.8° and 76.9° correspond to (011), (200), (111), (112), (103), (202), (301), and (222) crystal planes, which can be obtained from CoP standard cards (PDF#89-4862). The CoP prepared in this article has a certain Co-MOF morphology, which leads to a decrease in CoP diffraction peak intensity and low crystallinity, while the peak intensity of In2O3 does not decrease significantly, indicating that the prepared sample has excellent crystallinity [31]. No other heteropeaks are found in Fig. 4(a), indicating that the samples prepared by CoP and In2O3 have higher purity and the two diffraction peaks are both wider, indicating that the crystal size decreases. The smaller crystal size of In2O3 can better attach to CoP, which is consistent with SEM. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the peaks related to CoP and In2O3 can be observed in n-CPIO (n = 3,5,10,20) of both CoP and In2O3 complexes, which proves that n-CPIO (n = 3,5,10,20) was successfully prepared according to the proposed scheme. In2O3 exists in the complexes as a co-catalyst, and when the content of In2O3 is too low (<5 wt%), the diffraction peak of In2O3 cannot be observed in the complexes. Therefore, the In2O3 related peaks cannot be observed on the XRD patterns of 3-CPIO and 5-CPIO, while the diffraction peaks of (211), (222), (400), (440) and (622) crystal surfaces of In2O3 can be observed at 2θ = 21.50°, 30.59°, 35.46°, 51.02° and 60.67° at 10-CPIO and 20-CPIO. Moreover, the intensity of the diffraction peaks also increases with the increase of In2O3 content. 3.2 SEM and TEM analysis Through the SEM image, it can clearly see the specific morphology of In2O3, CoP and 10-CPIO. In Fig. 5 (a), In2O3 is a granular particle with a rough surface, which is conducive to adhesion on CoP surface during physical mixing. Fig. 5(b) is the SEM image of CoP. After phosphating, the original shape of ZIF-9 collapsed, which is taking the shape of a lotus leaf with a rough and porous surface. The compound 10-CPIO of the two is shown in Fig. 5(c). It can be observed that In2O3 has a high degree of composite with CoP, which In2O3 is closely dispersed and attached to the surface and groove of CoP. The 10-CPIO composite material was observed more microscopically on a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Fig. 5(d) and (e) are low-magnification TEM images, which the interface between lotus leaf-shaped CoP and In2O3 can be clearly seen. And the close contact between the two shows that CoP and In2O3 have a very strong interaction, and this close contact can accelerate the electron transfer. Fig. 5(f) is an HRTEM image where the lattice fringes can be clearly seen. In the figure, the lattice fringes of 0.147 nm, 0.187 nm, 0.138 nm and 0.156 nm be able to obtained, corresponding to the (311) and (202) crystal face of CoP and the (721) and (541) crystal face of In2O3, respectively. Fig. 5(g) shows that the lattice fringes are 0.111 nm, 0.161 nm, 0.110 nm and 0.121 nm, which correspond to the (833) and (620) crystal face of In2O3 and the (223) and (204) crystal face of CoP, respectively. 3.3 XPS results The surface chemical element ingredient and valence of the ready CoP, In2O3 and 10-CPIO photocatalysts were studied by XPS. Fig. 6 (a) shows the survey spectrum of pure CoP, pure In2O3 and composite 10-CPIO. The survey spectrum of the 10-CPIO catalyst contain the binding energy of Co 2p, O 1s, In 3d and P 2p, which proves the 10-CPIO catalyst contains Co, O, In and P elements. The XPS spectrum of In2O3 shown in Fig. 6(b) can be divided into two parts, which are 530 eV and 531.6 eV corresponding to InO and InOH, respectively [32]. The 531.2 eV in compound 10-CPIO is related to the lattice oxygen in CoP and In2O3 [33]. The XPS spectrum of In2O3 shown in Fig. 6(c) is divided into two parts of 444.5 eV and 452.1 eV, which are relevant to the characteristic spin orbits of In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 signals are consistent with the reported In2O3 values [33,34]. And due to the strong interaction between the two semiconductors after the recombination of CoP and In2O3, which causes a slight change of binding energy. Fig. 6(d) is the XPS spectrum of the contained Co element of CoP, divided into six parts 778.7 eV, 781.7 eV, 785.7 eV, 793.7 eV, 797.5 eV, and 803.2 eV which the binding energy values of 793.7 eV and 803.2 eV accordance to Co 2p1/2. Besides the two peaks of 778.7 eV and 785.7 eV are assigned to Co 2p3/2 and the two peaks of 781.7 eV and 797.5 eV are part of the vibration satellite peaks of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 [35]. Fig. 6(e) is the spectrum of P 2p, which are 130.2 eV and 133.2 eV are related to P 2p3/2 and P2O5 (or PO4 3−), respectively. And the binding energy of 129.5 eV shows P 2p1/2 [36]. In these XPS spectra analysis, In2O3 and CoP were indeed successfully combined. 3.4 BET characterization In order to study the BET exterior area on the optical catalytic activity, at 77 K was tested nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. The relevant data of the determination are listed in Table 1 and Fig. 7 . From Fig. 7 it can get the shape of nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of pure In2O3, pure CoP and 10-CPIO complexes is almost the same as that of type IV nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, and also has H3 type hysteresis loop. This indicates that the above samples possess mesoporous material properties, which is unanimous with the pore size allocation curve in the figure. The average pore size of the composite is the largest, and the average pore size of In2O3, CoP, and 10-CPIO are 15.46, 14.89, and 17.35 nm, which materials behave as mesoporous materials because average pore size is between 0−20 nm. The existence of mesoporous pore facilitates the mass transfer in reduction reactions such as heterogeneous photooxidation and water decomposition. From Table 1 can get the conclusion that the specific surface area of the 10-CPIO complex is between pure In2O3 and pure CoP, what specific surface areas of In2O3, CoP and 10-CPIO are 111.62, 8.84 and 17.20 m2 g−1, respectively. And the density difference between CoP and In2O3 and the difference in surface area per unit quality ratio is the main cause for the specific surface area of the ultimate compound alters. Table 1 the data display that the pore volume of the composite catalyst is enlarged by the combination with In2O3, which greatly promotes the adsorption of reactants and the diffusion of reaction products. 3.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution Hydrogen output was studied in 62 mL heat-resistant quartz flask use TEOA as the sacrificial reagent and EY as the photosensitive agent. Each time the hydrogen production is over, part of the EY will be degraded after TEOA reduces EY, so it can see the color of the solution fade to a certain extent [37]. Fig. 8 (a) shows pure In2O3, pure CoP, and 10-CPIO the amount of hydrogen evolution per hour in 5 h with TEOA (15 vol% pH = 10) as sacrificial reagent added 20 mg EY. The data displays that pure CoP began to have a certain amount of hydrogen evolution, because the CoP of the electron-hole recombination rate too high so inhibits hydrogen evolution, finally the five hour of hydrogen evolution amount of 83.78 μmol. While the pure In2O3 low amount of hydrogen evolution is due to its high electronic-hole recombination rate and phenomenon of self-agglomeration. The hydrogen evolution volume of 10-CPIO in five hour was 251.87 μmol, which is the three times higher than that of CoP. Because In2O3 as cocatalyst compound with CoP and get down electron-hole pair complex rate in order to enhance the amount of hydrogen evolution. Fig. 8(b) shows the hydrogen production within five hour of composite catalyst which prepared by indium oxide with different mass ratios and CoP under the same conditions. The maximum hydrogen production at a mass ratio of 10 wt% is 251.87 μmol, and the hydrogen production at mass ratio of 3 wt%, 5 wt%, and 20 wt% are 166.98 μmol, 211.65 μmol and 246.87 μmol, so that the best mass ratio is 10 wt%. Fig. 8(c) shows the stability test of 10-CPIO compound photocatalytic hydrogen production under the same conditions, which the sacrificial reagent TEOA is not changed in the whole experiment process and 20 mg EY is added at the end of each cycle to ensure its photocatalytic activity. And it is five hour taken as a cycle for a total of four cycles. By the way, the amount of EY should not be too much, because too much EY will have a shielding effect, thereby inhibiting the production of hydrogen. And that excessive EY will block part of the light, which will cause the excited EY molecules to self-quench, resulting in a decrease in light utilization [5]. The amount of EY used in the EY-sensitization system will affect the hydrogen production of the catalyst. In Fig. 8(e), a comparison of hydrogen production with different EY dosages within five hours is carried out. When EY = 5 mg, it is obvious that the hydrogen evolution cannot be effectively observed in the next three hours, indicating that the amount of EY is too little, and the amount of hydrogen production increases with the increase of the amount of EY. When EY = 30 mg, the amount of hydrogen production begins to decrease. This is because the shielding effect occurs when the amount of EY is too much, which affects the rate of hydrogen production. This experiment shows that the best EY dosage is 20 mg. The total amount of hydrogen evolution in each recurrence did not change much in the whole stability experiment, and its stability and photocatalytic activity are very good. Fig. 8(d) shows the amount of hydrogen evolution under the condition of only changing pH value of TEOA. It can be seen that 10-CPIO shows certain selectivity under different environments. In the slightly alkaline environment (pH = 10), the hydrogen evolution yield of 10-CPIO is the highest, which is 251.87 μmol, indicating that it is favorable for hydrogen evolution of 10-CPIO in the slightly alkaline environment. In the peracid environment, the TEOA will be protonated with the increase of acidity, which results in TEOA not being able to efficiently donate electrons. When alkalinity is too high, the H+ content in the whole system decreases, which is not conducive to the evolution hydrogen in the whole photocatalytic system thermodynamically. 3.6 UV–vis DRS analysis CoP, In2O3 and 10-CPIO optical performance measured by diffuse reflectance UV–vis. From Fig. 9 (a), In2O3 has excellent absorption in the range of 250−800 nm. From the curve in the figure, it can get that the absorption edge is at 525 nm, which may be due to the inherent absorption properties of In2O3. The 10-CPIO also has good absorption at 250−800 nm. Which compare with pure CoP, the absorption strength of 10-CPIO is significantly improved at 320−800 nm. When the photon energy absorbed by the catalyst is higher than its band gap energy, the separation of electrons and holes occurs. Then transfer the lead and valence bands respectively. The strong absorption intensity indicates that more light energy can be captured, which can accelerate the photocatalytic reaction of water and accelerate the decomposition of water. The introduction of In2O3 can effectively optimize the band gap conformation of the complex photocatalyst and improve the light absorption strength. Fig. 9(b) shows that In2O3 has a band gap of 2.64 eV. The band gap of CoP can be obtained from previous papers as 1.75 eV [38]. 3.7 Photoluminescence analysis The photoluminescence spectrum is study to the recombination of electron and hole in the photocatalytic system. After the photocatalyst generates electron and hole, some of them will move to the external of the stuff, and the leftover will reorganize. The energy emitted after recombination will be released in manner of fluorescence [39]. For more study the optical performance of CoP/In2O3, time-resolved photoluminescence experiment were carried out at room temperature to appraise its photocatalytic activity, and the time-resolved photoluminescence spectrum as shown in Fig. 10 (b) and Table 2 were obtained. As shown in Fig. 10(a), there are different emission peaks which were due to different electron-hole recombination rate. Under the excitation wavelength of 480 nm, the emission intensity of EY is highest at 534 nm (the range of 500−650 nm), due to the positive recombination of electron and hole under light irradiate. In2O3, CoP and 10-CPIO were added to the EY solution to measure the photoluminescence spectrum so that obtained photoluminescence spectra of In2O3, CoP and 10-CPIO all have a regular peak at 540 nm, but their peak intensity is different. The fluorescence intensity decreases to a certain extent compared with that of EY, and the fluorescence intensity of 10-CPIO composite photocatalyst decreases the most. It shows that the fluorescence intensity represents the degree of electron and hole recombination. The high fluorescence intensity indicates that there are many electrons transferred from the excited state to the ground state, the indicates that the electron and hole recombination rate is high. The decrease of fluorescence strength demonstrates that the electron and hole recombination rate will also decrease. Therefore, the prepared composite catalyst 10-CPIO inhibits the recombination of electron and hole which can increase the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production. Thus, the 10-CPIO prepared by In2O3 as co-catalyst and CoP can inhibit the recombination of electrons and holes to a certain extent. This fact proves that 10-CPIO prepared by the physical mixture method can enhance the photogenerated charge transfer, which is also correspond with the H2 production kinetics, and fully proves that the complex catalyst has excellent photocatalytic activity. A first-exponential decay model is used to fit the corresponding time-resolved spectrum, the formula is as follows [Eqs. (1) and (2)] [40]: (1) I t = ∑ B i e x p ( - t / τ i ) I is the standard emission intensity; t is the time after pulsed laser excitation; τi is the respective attenuation life; Bi is the corresponding weighting factor. (2) < τ > = ∑ B i τ i 2 / ∑ B i τ i < τ > is the average life; τi are the respective decay time; Bi is the corresponding weighting factor. Fig. 10(b) is time-resolved photoluminescence and Table 2 show and lists its average lifetime and carrier percentage. The average lifetime of the compound 10-CPIO is the shortest, indicating that the shorter the electron lifetime corresponds to the faster the electron transfer rate [41]. The average lifetime of 10-CPIO further illustrates that the electrons of the In2O3 conductive band can be quickly transferred to the position of the CoP conductive band to participate in the reduction reaction. The hydrogen production system can quickly transfer the carrier under visible light illumination. The increase in charge separation efficiency proves that the structure between the materials can be effectively improved and provides a beneficial structure that helps to create a beneficial catalyst for hydrogen production. 3.8 Photoelectric performance test Electrochemical experiments were carried out on the catalyst so that study the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. Fig. 11 (a) displays the photocurrent reply curve of the sample. This curve reflects the electron and hole separation characteristics, in which the photocurrent response is large, the separation efficiency of electron and hole is high, and the response is small, the separation efficiency is low [42]. The photocurrent reply of 10-CPIO is the highest, indicating that the composite catalyst improves the separation efficiency of electron and hole and promotes the photocatalytic reaction. This is consistent with the results of hydrogen production experiments. This test measured the polarization curves of CoP, 10-CPIO, and In2O3 to discuss the reasons why In2O3 as co-catalyst recombination with CoP which can improves the efficiency of hydrogen production. Fig. 11(b) is the linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) curve of the obtained sample. The LSV can obtained overpotential of the measured catalyst. The high overpotential means that the potential needed for hydrogen evolution reduction reaction is high, which will affect the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production. The experimental results show that the overpotential of the composite catalyst 10-CPIO is lower than that of CoP and In2O3, which means the potential needed for the reduction reaction of hydrogen evolution is lower than that of the other, so the hydrogen evolution efficiency of 10-CPIO is higher. Fig. 11(c) shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Typically, the smaller EIS curve radius, the more efficient the electron transfer efficiency of the sample, and the lower the impedance [43,44]. It can be seen that the compound 10-CPIO is a semiconductor with good performance. Thus 10-CPIO is a good catalyst for hydrogen evolution because its good conductivity and low overpotential. The flat band potential of the sample can be determined by [Eq. (3)] [45]: (3) 1 / C 2 = 2 N D e ε ε 0 - 1 · ( E - E f b - k T / e ) C is the capacitance of the space charge region; ND is charge carrier concentration; e is electron charge; ε is dielectric constant; ε0 is vacuum permittivity; E is electrode applied potential; Efb is flat band potentials; K is Boltzmann constant; T is absolute temperature. When calculating an n-type semiconductor, its conduction band potential is generally 0.1 or 0.2 V more negative than Efb. Fig. 11(d) and (e) are the Mott-Schottky curves of CoP and In2O3, respectively. The test environment is performed under the electrolyte of Na2SO4 (0.2 M) and pH = 8. Calculate ordinary hydrogen electrodes The following formula is used: ENHE = ESCE + 0.24 V, so it can calculate the conduction band (ECB) of CoP and In2O3 to be −0.24 V and −0.66 V, respectively. In addition, through the UV–vis DRS test, it can get the band gap values (Eg), and the valence band (EVB) of CoP and In2O3 can be obtained through the formula ECB = EVB – Eg. The calculated relevant data are shown in Table 3 . 3.9 Possible mechanism From the above discussion, it can be inferred that the photocatalytic hydrogen production process in the heterojunction system of sensitized CoP/In2O3 by EY. Under the conditions of visible light irradiation, EY dye molecules will be adsorbed on the CoP/In2O3 surface to form a single stimulated state EY1*, and EY1* will transform into a more steady EY3* triple stimulated state [46,47]. After accepting electrons, the quenched EY gains a forceful reduction ability, and then the electrons of EY will be turn over to the external of the CPIO catalyst, and then hydrogen gas will be generated through reduction reaction. After transferring electrons, the EY molecules will return to the ground state again. After being illuminated by light, the valence band of the CoP and In2O3 will form a large number of oxidation h+, and the conduction band will form a large number of reduced e−. After CoP and In2O3 are in close contact, the e− of CoP will participate in the hydrogen evolution reaction and show positive, the conduction band at the edge will also bend upward due to the loss of electrons. Compared with CoP, In2O3 with more negative conduction band potential is easier to accept the electrons from EY. Due to the accumulation of electrons, conduction band at the edge will therefore bend downward and show electronegative. Such bending of the conduction band makes it easier for the e− in the CB of In2O3 transferred to the CB of CoP, thereby improving the hydrogen evolution performance. In this system, the VB edge of In2O3 will bend downwards, and the VB edge of CoP will bend upwards, which hinders the transfer of the holes of In2O3 to CoP, resulting in only oxidation reaction. In the price band of both. In this way, the redox ability of this system is guaranteed, which may be the inner reason for the improved photocatalytic ability of CoP/In2O3. (Fig. 12 ) 4 Conclusions A new type of In2O3 modified CoP photocatalyst is prepared with outstanding photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. In this system, In2O3 with excellent co-catalytic effect consumes the accumulated h+ and promotes the circulation of e−, which is beneficial for the hydrogen evolution performance. And the hydrogen production performance of the CoP/In2O3 composite catalysis achieved 3 times higher than pure CoP. Higher photocurrent response, lower electrochemical impedance and lower overpotential, all the improved performance co-promote the enhance of the hydrogen evolution activity. The work in this paper provides an effective method for the hydrogen evolution of metal phosphides in dye-sensitized photocatalysts.

In this paper, proposed a CoP/In2O3 composite catalyst that performs well in hydrogen production. The total amount of hydrogen released of CoP/In2O3 composite catalyst which sensitized by Eosin Y (EY) after 5 h exposure to visible light reached 251.87 μmol, which was three times that of pure CoP under the same conditions. The composite catalyst CoP/In2O3 can be prepared by physically mixing CoP and In2O3 which just need one step. Among them, the Co-MOF (ZIF-9) is used as the precursor to prepare CoP by phosphating method, which maintains the framework structure of Co-MOF. In the CoP/In2O3 composite catalyst, the In2O3 particles as co-catalyst are tightly attached to the CoP surface, which improves the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs. Subsequent photoelectrochemical experiments also proved the improvement of charge transfer efficiency. A multitude of characterization techniques such as XRD, SEM, XPS, BET, etc. were also performed on the prepared samples.",
