Graphical abstract A surface-modified cross-linked polystyrene metal complex (PS–DCTACE–Cu(II)) is applied as catalyst of methyl methacrylate (MMA) heterogeneous polymerization at ambient temperature in Na2SO3 aqueous solution. The catalyst has excellent mechanical property and is easy to be separate from reaction system and recycled. The mechanism of polymerization, a process of ‘chloridion leaving-hydrogen transfer’, was also studied in this paper. A polymeric copper complex PS–DCTACE–Cu(II) including cross-linked polystyrene as ligand, whose surface was modified by dicarbonyl tetraza-crown ether groups, was prepared and characterized. It was utilized as a heterogeneous catalyst for methyl methacrylate (MMA) polymerization in Na2SO3 aqueous solution at ambient temperature. The monomer conversion was high and reaction condition was mild. Moreover, the catalyst had good mechanical property and was very easy to be recycled from the reaction system. The polymerization mechanism was also proposed and confirmed by corresponding detections. The polymerization proceeded through a free radical way, in which the radicals were formed by the process of ‘chloridion leaving-hydrogen transfer’ in this PS–DCTACE–Cu(II)/Na2SO3/MMA system. Keywords Microwave irradiation Polystyrene–Cu(II) complex Polymerization of MMA Catalytic mechanism 1 Introduction Polymeric metal complexes (PMC) are currently attracting considerable attention for a variety of applications, including development in nuclear chemistry, organic synthesis, wastewater treatment [1–6]. In particular, some polymeric transition metal complexes have shown unique properties in free radical polymerizations because of the specificity induced by the polymer matrix. For example, polymerizations initiated by polymeric metal complexes are usually heterogeneous reactions, in which the product is easier to be separated from the system and the catalysts can be recycled and reused. Although previous studies show earlier PMC need rigorous conditions and the conversion of monomer was low, progresses devoted to improving the reaction condition and monomer conversion have been made in our lab and others [7–9]. For instance, we once chose a PVAm–Cu(II)/Na2SO3 system (polyvinylamine, PVAm) as initiator for MMA homopolymerization and copolymerization. The polymerizations were moderate and environmental friendly. The mechanism of polymerization was also pretty interesting and different from that of CuCl2/Na2SO3 system (reduction–oxidation mechanism). It was unsaturated coordination of Cu(II) in the polymeric complex due to the curl and intertwist of macromolecule that catalyze the MMA polymerization. In this system, polymerizations were initiated by free radicals, which were generated from a process of ‘complexation-hydrogen transfer’. However, the amorphous catalyst powder had very poor mechanical property and was difficult to separate from reaction system after continuous stirring. In addition, using of excessive organic solvent make the extraction more complicated. Based on the previous research, we keep interests in obtaining other analogous complexes as practicable polymeric catalysts. Herein, we choose surface-modified cross-linked polystyrene (with a diameter of 1mm) as polymeric ligand. Dicarbonyl tetraza-crown ether functional groups are fixed on the surface to obtain a coordination-saturated Cu(II) complex, in which four N atoms from a tetraza-crown ether group can pick up a Cu(II) ion steadily. However, could such a complex with saturated coordination number catalyze the polymerization of MMA, and how it works? With the question in mind, we prepared this kind of cross-linked polystyrene and studied the catalysis of its Cu(II) complex for MMA polymerization. The polystyrene and its Cu(II) complex could not dissolve in common water and organic solvents. By utilizing the heterogeneous PS–DCTACE–Cu(II)/Na2SO3 aqueous system, the polymerization of MMA was proceeded at room temperature with better monomer conversion (82%). The obtained PMMA can dissolve in organic solvates and the catalyst can be easily recycled by filtrate. More importantly, we found that the mechanical property of the catalyst increased greatly. Its shape was preserved much better than those of other amorphous analogues. Moreover, in this PS–DCTACE–Cu(II)/Na2SO3 system, a new catalytic mechanism—‘chloridion leaving-hydrogen transfer’—was also proposed and studied herein. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Methyl methacrylate (MMA), methyl acrylate (MA), styrene (ST) and butyl acrylate (BA) were purified before polymerization [10] while styrene was purified as described in reference [11]. Chloromethylation cross-linked polystyrene (small ball with a diameter of 1mm, cross-linked degree is 3.5% and chlorine content is 18%), diethyl malonate, triethylene tetramine, sodium sulfite and cupric dichloride were used as received without further purification. 2.2 Preparation of PS–DCTACE and PS–DCTACE–Cu(II) The synthesis of the cross-linked polystyrene, onto whose surface was fixed with dicarbonyl tetraza-crown ether groups (dicarbonyl tetraza-crown ether polystyrene, PS–DCTACE) was depicted in Scheme 1 . Polystyrene–diether malonate (PS–DEM) was obtained by treatment of chloromethylation cross-linked polystyrene in 1,4-dioxiane with diethyl malonate and KOH aqueous solution under microwave radiation. The product was washed with acetone, deionized water and dried in vacuo. Triethylenetetamine was then reacted with the PS–DEM under microwave radiation to form the cross-linked polymer PS–DCTACE. IR (KBr) of PS–DCTACE: (3414, 2850, 1645 (CO), 1500, 1092, 652cm−1; the N content in PS–DCTACE was 8.87% and the benzyl chloride conversion to dicarbonyl-tetraza crown ether was 31.6%. Polymeric complex PS–DCTACE–Cu(II) was obtained by the reaction of PS–DCTACE and cupric dichloride. The mixture was stirred overnight and filtered. The final product was washed with deionized water to remove excessive cupric ion and dried in vacuum. IR (KBr) of PS–DCTACE–Cu(II): 3447, 2894, 2810, 1637 (CO), 1480, 1100, 630cm−1. The copper content in the complex was determined by HITACHI 180-80 atomic absorption spectroscopy. The coordination style of the cupric was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electric conductivity. 2.3 Polymerization procedure and analysis of polymer The polymerization of MMA with PS–DCTACE–Cu(II)/Na2SO3 system has been investigated at room temperature. The mixture of MMA, PS–DCTACE–Cu(II) and sodium sulfite with appropriate ratios was added into aqueous solution (50mL) under nitrogen. The polymerization was terminated by adding 2,2-diphenyl-1-picylhydrazyl solution (DPPH). PMMA was precipitated, filtered and dried under vacuum till the weigh is a constant. Weight-average molecular weights and the molecule weight distributions of the products were determined by Waters 1515 gel permeation chromatograph GPC. GPC experiments were conducted in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution at 298K with polystyrene as reference. The polymerizations of other monomers such as styrene, butyl acrylate and methyl acrylate with PS–DCTACE–Cu(II)/Na2SO3 system in aqueous solution were carried out similar with that of MMA polymerization. However, no polymer product was obtained even reaction time exceeded 24h. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characteristics of PS–DCTACE 3.1.1 Solid-state NMR spectra The solid-state 13C NMR of PS–DCTACE spectrum is shown in Fig. 1 . It reveals the structure of tetraza-crown ether connecting with the cross-linked polymer. The resonances at 49.4–55.0 and 180.4ppm are very similar with those found in the organic compound 1,4,7,10-tetraaza-cyclotridecane-11,13-dione. Thus, we speculate that the side chain of PS–DCTACE has analogous structure with that of 1,4,7,10-tetraaza-cyclotridecane-11,13-dione. 3.2 Characteristics of complex PS–DCTACE–Cu(II) 3.2.1 XPS spectra The inner electrons’ binding energies of PS–DCTACE–Cu(II) and CuCl2·2H2O are shown in Table 1 , respectively. Table 1 show that Cu2+ ions coordinate with the functional groups fixed on the surface of polymer. For example, the binding energy of Cu2p3/2, Cu2p1/2 in PS–DCTACE–Cu(II) are 1.8 and 2.3eV, respectively, less than those of CuCl2·2H2O (934.2 and 954.6eV). The electron's binding energy of N 1s (401.0eV) in Cu(II) complex is larger 1.1eV than that in PS–DCTACE. These obvious differences describe that Cu ions are coordinated with N atoms from the functional group DCTACE. The result is similar with that observed in the PVAm–Cu(II) complex [9]. It is worthy noting that another binding energy of Cu at 942.6eV in PS–DCTACE–Cu(II) complex is low-energy shifted and its strength is obviously decreased compared with that of CuCl2·2H2O (Fig. 2 ). It infers that Cu(II) in the complex might adopt a low-spin state and the coordination number of Cu(II) in the PS–DCTACE–Cu(II) is 6, four N atoms from a tetraza-crown ether group and two Cl− anions [12]. In addition, Cl− electron's binding energy of Cl2p of PS–DCTACE–Cu(II) is 1eV less than that of CuCl2·2H2O, which indicates that the interaction between Cl− and Cu(II) is weakened. 3.2.2 Electric conductivity The coordination number of Cu(II) is further measured by electric conductivity with comparison of CuCl2 aqueous solutions and corresponding PS–DCTACE–Cu(II) solutions. The results are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3 . According to Table 2, electric conductivity almost keeps a constant after the concentration of Cu(II) is about 7.9mmol/L and the corresponding ratio of N/Cu is about 4.0. Thus, we speculate that the ratio of N/Cu is about 4 [13]. 3.3 Proposed mechanism for polymerization of MMA 3.3.1 Comparison of the polymerization of MMA catalyzed by copper(II) and PS–DCTACE–Cu(II) complex The polymerization of MMA can be initiated by PS–DCTACE–Cu(II) with the existence of Na2SO3 solution even at room temperature, while PS–DCTACE–Cu(II) shows no catalytic property to MMA polymerization with absence of Na2SO3 aqueous solution. Obviously, Na2SO3 plays an important role in the process of polymerization. In order to better understand the mechanism of the polymerization of MMA, two different systems: PS–DCTACE–Cu(II)/Na2SO3 system and CuCl2/Na2SO3 system are studied firstly. As shown in Fig. 4 , the MMA conversion was influenced by concentration of cupric in Cu2+/Na2SO3 system significantly, while the influence is minor by use of PS–DCTACE–Cu(II)/Na2SO3 system. On the other hand, PS–DCTACE–Cu(II)/Na2SO3 system shows more effective catalytic activity in MMA polymerization and the monomer conversion is higher under the similar conditions. Thus, we speculate that the polymerization mechanism in PS–DCTACE–Cu(II)/Na2SO3 system may be different from that in CuCl2/Na2SO3 system (reduction–oxidation mechanism). 3.3.2 Polymerization in different pH value with PS–DCTACE–Cu(II)/Na2SO3 system The reactivity of PS–DCTACE–Cu(II)/Na2SO3 system at different pH value is investigated in order to confirm the primary radicals involved in the polymerization. S O 3 2 − + H 2 O ⇌ HS O 3 − + O H − k 1 = 1 2 1.59 × 10 − 7 HS O 3 − + H 2 O ⇌ H 2 S O 3 + O H − k 2 = 1 2 7.69 × 10 − 13 S O 3 2 − + 2 H 2 O ⇌ H 2 S O 3 + 2 O H − k 3 = 1 2 1.22 × 10 − 19 Fig. 5 shows the monomer conversion at different pH value. The conversion is promoted at the beginning with the pH value increasing. However, the highest conversion (62%) is reached at pH=7, but decreases greatly after that. The result is similar with that found in the MMA polymerization by use of PVAm–Cu(II)/Na2SO3 system. It implies that HSO3 − participates in this polymerization because the concentration of HSO3 − is dominated at this pH value (according to theoretical calculation, the concentrations of H2SO3, HSO3 − and SO3 2− are 4.11×10−8 mol/L, 4.38×10−3 mol/L, 2.27×10−3 mol/L, respectively, at pH=7). We consider that the oxygen atoms of HSO3 − and carbonyl of MMA monomer may coordinate with Cu(II) when the Cl− anions dissociate from the complex, so that MMA and HSO3 − can be activated by the complexation. H free radical is dissociated from the activated HSO3 −, initiating the polymerization of MMA. Therefore, the PS–DCTACE–Cu(II) catalyzes MMA polymerization in a coordination way. In addition, the existence of SO3 − as end group in PMMA was verified through dye partition [14], which further indicated that HSO3 − was one of the active species and source of primary radicals. 3.3.3 Chloridion detection in the polymerization A chloridion selective electrode was applied in determining the concentrations of free Cl− ions ([Cl−]) in this system and the relationship of polymerization time with [Cl−] is shown in Fig. 6 . It depicts that during the polymerization, [Cl−] increases significantly at first half an hour, and then decreases gradually after a certain period (about 100min). As the stronger donor atoms, oxygen atoms from MMA and HSO3 −, can substitute for the Cl− ions at first, free chlorides enter into the solution and the correspondent [Cl−] increases. When the polymerization was initiated, Cu(II) coordinate free Cl− again with MMA and HSO3 − leaving. So, the chloridion detection shows free [Cl−] is obviously reduced. The variation of [Cl−] verifies that it is the process ‘chloridion leaving-hydrogen transfer’ that initiates the polymerization. 3.3.4 Polymerizations of other monomers with PS–DCTACE–Cu(II) aqueous system According to our previous research [8], we suspect that the PS–DCTACE–Cu(II)/Na2SO3 system has special catalysis for MMA polymerization. So, it was utilized to catalyze the polymerization of styrene, butyl acrylate, methyl acrylate and MMA, respectively, at room temperature. The results show that only PMMA was obtained in 29% conversion and the other monomers cannot be catalyzed in this system. It is reasonable that the mentioned monomers except MMA cannot be polymerized in this system [8]. Due to lack of lone-pair electrons, styrene could not coordinate with PS–DCTACE–Cu(II) so that the polymerization cannot be proceeded. Other acrylate monomers cannot be catalyzed because lack of donor methyl on double bond (BA) or the double bond difficult to be polarized (Table 3 ). That is, because MMA has donor methyl on double bond and can coordinate with Cu(II) ion by oxygen atom, it is easy to be initiated by the PS–DCTACE–Cu(II)/Na2SO3 system. According to all above experiments, we therefore propose a novel mechanism (Scheme 2 ), which is different from those applied in CuCl2/Na2SO3 system and PVAm–Cu(II)/Na2SO3 system. It is a four-step process. Firstly, the leaving of Cl− results in the coordination vacancy around the Cu(II) ion so that HSO3 − and carbonyl of MMA can be activated by coordinating with Cu(II) (step 1). Secondly, the activated HSO3 − can provide H free radicals to initiate the polymerization (step 2). In the catalysis system, Na2SO3 acts as initiator and the source of primary free radicals. Terminal SO3 group was detected in the polymer by dye-partition and further manifest that SO3 − is one of the reactive species (step 3). However, when the polymerization is initiated, the HSO3 − and carbonyl of MMA dissociate with Cu(II) and Cl− ions return to the former coordination sites (step 4). That is, the process ‘chloridion leaving-hydrogen transfer’ that initiates the polymerisation. 3.4 Polymerization of MMA in PS–DCTACE–Cu(II)/Na2SO3 system The average molecular weight (Mw), polydispersity and yield of PMMA obtained in PS–DCTACE–Cu(II)/Na2SO3 system at 20°C were listed in Table 4 . As presented in Table 4, obtained PMMA has higher monomer conversion as well as higher molecular weight. It is concluded that PS–DCTACE–Cu(II)/Na2SO3 system may be a good catalyst in polymerization of MMA without steric conditions. Experiments also show, even at room temperature, the molecular weight of PMMA can be reached at almost 1 million with monomer conversion of 82% after 12h. 4 Conclusions A surface-modified polystyrene, PS–DCTACE and its Cu(II) complex (PS–DCTACE–Cu(II)) were synthesized and characterized by spectroscopy. The Cu(II) ion was coordinated in a saturated way, two chlorides and four N atoms from a tetraza-crown group, which was determined by XPS and electric conductivity. The title complex can initiate the polymerization of MMA with existence of Na2SO3 in high monomer conversion and high molecular weight in moderate condition. More importantly, the mechanical property of the catalyst increased greatly. Its shape was preserved much better than those of other amorphous analogues and easier to be recycled. The mechanism of the polymerization was different from that of CuCl2/Na2SO3 system (reduction–oxidation mechanism). It is verified that a process of ‘Cl− leaving-H transferring’ was involved in the initiation. It is compared with previously reported the PVAm/Na2SO3 system applied in the homopolymerization and copolymerization of MMA, that belong to this family of catalyst.
