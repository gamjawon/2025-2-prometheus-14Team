Surface-roughened Pb electrodes were prepared through a facile oxidation–reduction cycle. Compared with their smooth surface counterparts, the electrodes exhibited significantly higher activity, selectivity, and energy utilization in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to HCOOH using water under ambient temperature and pressure. Furthermore, the modified electrodes maintained high activities after operating repeatedly for five batches. The enhanced performance of these electrodes is attributed to the enlarged active surface area and increased number of reactive species associated with the three-dimensional structure of the surface. Both the hydrogenation mechanism and the hydrogencarbonate mechanism were affected during the electrochemical CO2 reduction. Graphical abstract Keywords Oxidation-reduction cycles Roughened Pb electrode CO2 reduction Formate 1 Introduction The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to organic chemicals with high energy density has been extensively investigated [1], and a number of metals have been used as electron transfer mediators [2,3]. Among the metals investigated, lead appears to be the most suitable electrode material for industrial applications [4]. However, improving further the catalytic activity of Pb electrodes for the electroreduction of CO2 remains challenging. The activity and selectivity of a catalyst vary significantly with the morphology of the electrode. The small surface area associated with the low number of catalytically active sites of planar electrodes typically limits their catalytic performance. This obstacle can be overcome by either using different materials or by forming a three-dimensional (3D) surface structure, which functions differently from smooth surfaces [5]. To date, surface roughening via the electrochemical oxidation–reduction cycle (ORC) procedure has focused mainly on the coinage metals such as Au, Ag, and Cu [6,7]. Previous studies have shown that Pb negative electrodes are covered by non-conducting PbSO4 particles during charging and discharging of the lead-acid battery [8,9]. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first-ever report of the roughening of Pb during the ORC preparation of Pb-particle-covered Pb electrodes. Different from the method presented by Lee and Kanan using pulsed anodization followed by electroreduction [10], the in-situ ORC was used to prepare roughened Pb electrodes for efficient electrical-to-chemical energy conversion in the present work. 2 Experimental All electrochemical experiments were performed using a CHI-660D electrochemical workstation (CH Instrument, USA). The ORC method was used for the roughening treatment of Pb on a three-electrode system; this system consisted of a polished Pb plate (20mm×20mm), a saturated calomel electrode (SCE), and a platinum plate (25mm×25mm), which served as the working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively. The measured potentials vs. SCE were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale according to the Nernst equation. The potential was cycled from −1.36 to 1.44V and then reversed to −1.36V. This procedure was repeated four times, at a scan rate of 10mVs−1, in an aqueous electrolyte containing 0.5molL−1 NaCl and 0.5molL−1 NaOH. The surface morphology of the electrode was examined using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan). The corresponding crystal phases formed during the roughening process were determined via X-ray diffraction (XRD, XPert Pro MPD, PANalytical, Netherlands). The 4h electrochemical reduction of CO2 was performed under sealed conditions by constant-potential electrolysis in a two-compartment electrolytic cell divided by a Nafion-117 cation-exchange membrane. The three-electrode assembly consisted of a Pb working electrode before and after roughening, an SCE reference electrode, and a platinum plate counter electrode. A portion (100mL) of 0.1molL−1 KHCO3 pre-saturated with compressed CO2 for 30min, and 150mL of 0.5molL−1 KOH served as the catholyte and anolyte, respectively. The catholyte was stirred by a magnetic stirrer during electrolysis and the reaction temperature was maintained at 25°C by a circulating water bath connected to a thermostat (THD-2015, TianHeng, China). Gaseous and liquid products were sampled from the cathodic compartment and analyzed. The evolved H2 was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (model 7890B, Agilent, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a HP-Plot MoleSieve capillary column (30m×320μm×12μm). The formate was quantified by ion chromatography (model ICS 2000; Dionex, USA). The selectivity, conversion rate, and energy utilization of the resulting HCOOH and H2 are described by the Faradaic efficiency (FE), partial current density (PCD), and energetic efficiency (EE), respectively. See the Supplementary content for details. 3 Result and discussion Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the Pb before surface modification as well as after ORC treatment in the fourth positive (oxidation step) and negative scan (reduction step). The peaks corresponding to the Pb substrate and the roughened Pb are well-matched to the standard Pb peaks (JCPDS No. 65–2873). However, the peaks of the electrode obtained from the oxidation steps are perfectly indexed to the tetragonal PbO structure [11]. This indicates that PbO formed predominantly on the Pb surface for scans in the positive direction at potentials of −1.36 to 1.44V vs RHE; moreover, Pb was regenerated when the potential scan was reversed to the initial potential. Fig. 1b–d shows the SEM image of the ORC-treated Pb electrode. For comparison, the surface morphology of the mechanically polished Pb substrate, without further modification, is shown in the inset of Fig. 1b. The inset shows the smooth surface of the pristine Pb electrode. In contrast, the ORC-treated electrodes exhibit various morphologies. The treated electrode surface contains a uniform distribution of octahedral-like Pb particles, which have an average size of ~0.5μm. A typical micrograph of the cross-section of the roughened Pb (Fig. 1d), reveals the strong anchoring of agglomerated particles to the surface and the ~18μm thickness of the roughened layer. These agglomerated particles form a 3D structure, with pore widths of ~1μm, in the rough layer. The morphological changes were examined during the ORC treatment of a Pb plate modified in the fourth positive scan (ending at a switching potential of 1.44V). As Fig. 1c shows, the electrode surface consists of well-defined ~10μm (length)×90–100nm (diameter) interconnected fibers, which form nest-like structures. The SEM images and the XRD data indicate that the micro-structured fibers are composed of PbO. Roughened and flat-bulk Pb cathodes, which were treated in CO2-saturated KHCO3 catholyte at room temperature and ambient pressure, exhibited different performance during a 4h electrolysis. As in previous studies [3,4], HCOOH and H2 were the main products of this electrolysis. Gas and ion chromatography analysis confirmed that these were the only products formed in any of our experiments. Fig. 2a shows the FE of HCOOH and H2 production as a function of applied cathode potential. The ORC treatment resulted in a significant change in the FE of the HCOOH formation. In fact, the FE of CO2 reduction to HCOOH on a rough Pb electrode was consistently higher, at all potentials, than that obtained on the smooth counterpart. A maximum FE of 88% was obtained at a cathode potential of −0.96V vs RHE for roughened Pb, reaching the FE obtained by Kanan et al. using “oxide-derived” Pb cathode prepared by a time-consuming two-step approach [10]. Moreover, this value is the same as that obtained by Köleli and Balun for Pb-granule electrodes in an aqueous 0.2M K2CO3 electrolyte under 5MPa pressure and at ambient temperature [12]; Kokoh et al. also obtained the same FE as well under ambient pressure and at 4°C [4]. In contrast, polished Pb exhibited a maximum FE of only 56%, which was achieved at a more negative (compared to −0.96V) cathode potential of −1.16V vs RHE. The FE of HCOOH formation increases gradually from 40% at −0.36V to 88% at −0.96V on the roughened Pb electrode and from 25% at −0.36V to 55% at −1.16V on smooth Pb, and then decreases to 39% and 21% respectively at −1.66V. The FE for the competing H2 evolution shows a more complicated pattern. Between −0.36 and −0.76V, it first increases from 1.3% to 30% on roughened Pb and from 1.8% to 66% on smooth Pb. Then it decreases to 11% at −0.96V on the former electrode and to 45% at −1.16V on the latter to finally increase gradually to respectively 57% and 79% at −1.66V. The hydrogen evolution reaction dominates at potentials more negative than −1.46V for the roughened Pb and at potentials more negative than −1.16V for the smooth Pb. Thus, a higher FE was achieved for the roughened Pb at a lower overpotential, showing that, compared to planar Pb, roughened Pb has a higher activity to reduce CO2 to HCOOH. The roughened Pb also shows a higher selectivity, at −0.96V, in the competition between CO2 reduction to HCOOH and H2 evolution: FEHCOOH/FEH2 ≈8.0 (89% selectivity) for the roughened Pb compared to a ratio of ~1.2 (55% selectivity) at −1.16V for the smooth Pb. The total FE of HCOOH and H2 formation was found to be less than 100% when the electrode potential was varied from −0.36V to −0.76V. However, a total FE of ~100% was obtained at potentials more negative than −0.76V. Similar results were found by other researchers. They hypothesized that the total FE of less than unity at low overpotential was due to small gas leaks, unidentified products, and product crossover followed by chemical reactions [13]. However, we deduced that the deficiency of total FE may have been due to undetected substances other than HCOOH and H2, as discussed below. The EE of HCOOH generation exhibited a trend similar to that of the FE with maximum values of 51% and 28% obtained for the roughened and polished Pb (Fig. 2b), respectively; i.e., the maximum EE of the former is ~1.8 times that of the latter. The EE obtained under the experimental conditions used in this work is similar to the maximum value reported by Kenis et al. [14], albeit for a different reaction system [15–26]. The current density on the electrodes is directly proportional to the reaction rate. As the cathodic potential increased negatively from −0.36 to −1.66V, the total current density increased gradually from 0.10 to 8.81mAcm−2 on smooth Pb and from 0.16 to 10.37mAcm−2 on the roughened Pb electrode, respectively. Obvious differences in the CO2 reduction activities of the roughened and planar Pb electrodes were evaluated by comparing the PCD of HCOOH formation (HCOOH PCD) during the electrochemical process. Fig. 2c reveals that, at cathode potentials of −0.36 to −1.66V vs. RHE, HCOOH PCD is 2–3 times higher with the roughened Pb electrode than with the smooth electrode. For example, at potentials of −0.96 and −1.66V, the HCOOH PCD was 1.17 and 4.04mAcm−2 for the roughened Pb, and 0.43 and 1.85mAcm−2 for smooth Pb electrode, respectively. The HCOOH PCD increases markedly with increasingly negative electrode potentials. Limiting currents were not observed and this implies that, in the range of potentials investigated, the electrochemical CO2 reduction was controlled mainly by electrochemical and chemical reactions rather than by the kinetics of diffusion. Therefore, the roughened Pb electrode enhanced the electrocatalytic kinetics relative to that of the untreated Pb electrode. As mentioned earlier, there is a competition between H2 evolution and reduction of CO2 and this competition is influenced by the structure of the electrode surface. Thus, the corresponding H2 PCD is slightly lower on the rough Pb cathode than on smooth Pb and increases upon decreasing the potential. This shows that, the HCOOH PCD/H2 PCD ratio of the 3D structure created by roughening the Pb surface, is higher than that of the smooth surface (e.g., at −0.96V, the former is 8.0 and the latter is only 0.75). Electrode stability is also an important factor that determines whether the electrochemical reduction of CO2 can be maintained. Therefore, electrocatalytic processes were performed in five successive experiments recycling the same cathode. The results (Fig. 2d) indicate that the fabricated rough Pb remains stable throughout the experiments and efficiently reduces CO2 to HCOOH. Various reaction mechanisms have been proposed for the electrochemical CO2 reduction on metal electrodes depending on the given conditions [12,27–32]. Different reaction paths have been formulated to elucidate the high yield of HCOOH as a reaction endproduct in sp-metals in an aqueous KHCO3 solution [29–32]. Some researchers have suggested that HCOOH is formed through the mediation of the carbon dioxide radical anion (CO2 −) as described in Eqs. (S4–S7) (CO2 − mechanism) [32–34]. Nonetheless, the reduction of CO2 to CO2 − is a highly unfavorable one-electron transfer that requires a very negative reduction potential of −1.9V. To explain the reduction of CO2 at more positive potentials, the reduction of CO2 to HCOOH initiated by adsorptive hydrogen (Had) was postulated, as described in Eqs. (S8–S12) (hydrogenation mechanism) [12,27,28]. In this study, HCOOH was detected at potentials positive to −1.9V, supporting the view that electrochemical CO2 reduction proceeded via the hydrogenation mechanism. Note that the sum of FE for HCOOH and H2 formation was found to be less than 100% at Pb electrode potentials positive to −0.76V. Recently, Kokoh and co-workers pointed out the possibility of the synthesis of HCOOH from hydrogen carbonate on a lead electrode in an alkaline solution. The reaction steps are summarized in Eqs. (S13–S16) (hydrogen carbonate mechanism) [27,28,32]. To validate the presented reaction pathway, direct reduction of a 0.1M KHCO3 aqueous solution in the absence of CO2 (N2 purging) was established at a potential range of −0.36 to −0.76V. These experiments yielded FEs for HCOOH formation of 41%, 32%, and 21% on roughened Pb, as well as 23%, 14%, and 10% on planar Pb at potentials of −0.36, −0.56, and −0.76V, respectively. Correspondingly, the FE for H2 formation was 1%, 15%, and 72% on roughened Pb as well as 2%, 27%, and 83% on planar Pb. Obviously, at −0.36V, the FE of HCOOH obtained from the N2 purging experiment nearly approached that obtained from CO2 purging, whereas at −0.56 and −0.76V, the HCOOH yield was higher for the CO2 purging system than for the N2 purging system. The results demonstrated that the hydrogen carbonate mechanism dominated the reduction process at the cathode potential more positively than −0.56V. At other electrolysis potential values, the Pb electrode preferentially reduced CO2 in a 0.1M KHCO3 aqueous solution rather than HCO3 −. In addition, the sum of FE of HCOOH and H2 account for no more than 100% that of the N2 purging experiment. The result was similar to the case in the presence of CO2 (CO2 purging). In particular, the deficiency of FE was almost the same with and without CO2 in the electrolyte. Thus, we inferred that the accumulation of intermediates such as and caused the loss of the obtained FE. The XRD and SEM results suggest that the enhanced capabilities of the roughened Pb electrodes stem from the formation of a three-dimensional structure on the Pb surface. In other words, surface roughening plays a key role in enhancing the electrocatalytic performance during CO2 reduction in an aqueous solution. It is believed that the rough and porous surface enhances the electrochemical performance, only if the roughened layer of the electrode is thicker than the electrical double layer (EDL) [33]. Otherwise, the surface of the electrode can be considered a smooth surface. The Debye length of the EDL is typically 1–100nm thick [34]. The ~18-μm-thick roughened layer on the Pb electrode surface is, therefore, at least two orders of magnitude thicker than the EDL. As a result, in the present work, the adjacent pores in the roughened Pb could be accessible and the electric field would map the exact shape of the micropores. This in turn resulted in a larger surface area for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 compared to that of the smooth surface electrode. Moreover, the 3D electrode configuration provided high surface area-to-volume ratios and hence a high-concentration reaction environment for the electroreduction of CO2 [35]. Combined above, an enhanced activity of, and selectivity for, HCOOH generation was achieved on the roughened Pb electrode. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, roughened Pb exhibits high electrocatalytic activity, high selectivity and stability, and high energy efficiency for the conversion of CO2 to HCOOH in water under normal pressure and ambient temperature. The electrochemical reduction of CO2 proceeded via the hydrogenation mechanism and the hydrogen carbonate mechanism. The improved performance stems from the unique 3D structure of the roughened surface. Moreover, the in-situ ORC method has significant potential for use in modifying other types of metal electrodes for the electro-reduction of CO2.
