ENGELHARDT and I. ZSINKA Central Research Institute for Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, 1525 Budapest, P.O. Box 17 (Hungary) Summary Stereoisomerization of 2-butenes and cross-metathesis of 2-butenes with 1-butene have been studied over MoOa/Al^Oa and Re^Ov/A^Os catalysts. Stereoisomerization over Mo03/Al203 was found to proceed via both meta- thesis and in a non-metathetic way. Over Re207/Al203, where non-metathetic isomerization can be excluded, the rate of Stereoisomerization was higher for trans- than for ci's-2-butene. The characteristics for cross-metathesis were as follows: selective formation of frans-2-pentene in trans-2-butene + 1- butene mixtures; formation of more propene than pentenes, especially in mixtures containing more 1-butene than 2-butene; lower rate of cross-meta- thesis in mixtures containing cis-2-butene than that in mixtures containing frans-2-butene. Introduction The nature of the geometric isomers of olefins has a strong influence on their reactivity in metathesis. The rate of metathesis of trans isomers is usu- ally lower than that of cis isomers. Basset et al. [1] have described that in homogeneous catalytic systems trans-2-pentene alone cannot initiate metathesis, and after initiation it has a metathesis rate which is lower than that obtained with c(s-2-pentene. Slow initiation in the metathesis of 2,8-decadienes was recorded by Grubbs and Hoppin [2] in the case of the trans,trans isomer, and even after initiation with a trace of 1-hexene conversion proceeded at approximately half the rate of the cis,cis isomer. A much lower metathesis rate for ^rans-2-pentene than that of cis-2-pentene was observed by Mol et al. both in homogeneous cata- lytic systems [3] and over Re207/Al203 [4]. According to Tanaka et al. [5], the metathesis of ^rans-2-butene proceeded without induction over MoO^/ j3-Ti02 and the rate of formation of frans-2-butene-d4 by the metathesis of ^rans-2-butene-do and -dg was close to the rate of formation of ci's-2-butene- c;4 by the metathesis of ci's-2-butene-do and -dg. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 170 Over freshly oxidized molybdena-alumina, stereoisomerization of cis- 2-butene was found to proceed in a non-metathetic way [6]. After induction with reactant, however, metathesis was found to be the prevailing but not the only process in stereoisomerization. The total rate of stereoisomerization on inducted catalyst was higher for cis- than for trans-2-butene as reactant [7]. Over Re^O-;/Al^Oy, significantly higher selectivity for metathesis was observed in the transformation of 1-butene than over inducted molybdena- alumina [8]. Under similar conditions, in contrast to molybdena-alumina, the rate of stereoisomerization of frans-2-butene on Re^O^/AliO^ was higher than that of ci's-2-butene [9]. In spite of the high metathesis selectivity, the rate of stereoisomeriza- tion of 2-butenes cannot be regarded as a measure for their reactivity in meta- thesis. Besides metathetic stereoisomerization, regenerative metathesis may take place simultaneously [1, 10]. The ratio of the rate of regenerative meta- thesis to that of stereoisomerization is more than probably different for cis- and trans-2-butene. Consequently one cannot conclude from the rate of stereoisomerization, the total rate of metathesis. Regenerative metathesis of olefins may only be observed in tracer exper- iments (e.g. the reaction of ci's-2-butene-do and -dg). Some valuable informa- tion for the reactivities of 2-butenes in metathesis can be gained, however, from data of their cross-metathesis with 1-butene. In the work reported here the transformation of c('s- and trans-2-butene and their cross-metatheses have been studied over Re207/Ala03 and MoO^/Al-iO-s catalysts. Experimental Catalysts The same molybdena-alumina (9.1 wt.% MoOa) and rhenia-alumina (11.5 wt.% Re2C>7) catalysts as in previous work [8, 11] were used. They were prepared by the impregnation of Ketjen CK 300 7-A1203 (particle size 0.2 - 0.4 mm). The catalysts were activated and regenerated by recirculation of atmospheric dry oxygen at 823 K for 1 h and evacuated at 303 K for 1 h. Molybdena-alumina was activated in a different manner as well. After activation with oxygen, it was reduced with recirculation of atmospheric hydrogen for 2 h at 823 K. The water produced in the reduction was re- moved in a trap cooled with liquid nitrogen. The hydrogen reversibly ad- sorbed was removed after reduction by evacuation for 1 h at 823 K. The anion vacancies formed in reduction [12] were re-oxidized by flushing the catalyst at 823 K for 1.5 h with nitrogen saturated at 313 K with water vapour [13]. Then the catalyst was evacuated for 1 h at 823 K. Reactants 1-Butene, ci's-2-butene and trans-2-butene were Matheson C.P. grade; before use they were outgassed repeatedly after freezing with liquid nitrogen. Pure nitrogen was passed through a trap cooled with liquid nitrogen and a 171 tube filled with Ridox Reagent (Fischer Scientific Co.) to remove traces of water and oxygen. Hydrogen was purified by diffusion using a Matheson hydrogen purifier. Procedures The experiments were carried out in a closed glass recirculation system equipped with greaseless '0' ring taps. The composition of the gas phase was determined by gas chromatographic analysis. Samples were withdrawn through a septum by means of a gas-tight syringe. Air infiltration through the septum was avoided by maintaining a pressure greater than 1 atm in the circulation system. No drop in pressure owing to leakage was observed. Samples were separated at 293 K on a 3 m long gas chromatographic column containing Chromosorb-P coated with 20% dibenzylamine, or at 273 K on a 6 m long column containing Chromosorb-P coated with 30% propylene carbonate, when separation of cis- and ^rans-2-pentene was desirable. The chromato- gram was recorded with a flame ionization detector. Results Transformation of cis- and trans-2-butene was carried out separately at 313 K and 1 atm pressure over 1 g of oxidized molybdena-alumina. As can be seen in Fig. 1, stereoisomerization was the main reaction in both case. The rate of cis-* trans transformation was approximately 1.5-times higher than that of trans -* cis transformation. Small amounts of 1-butene, propene and 2-pentene were formed as well, the latter two obviously via the cross-metathesis of 2-butenes while 1-butene was produced via the double-bond shift isomerization of 2-butenes. In the case of trans-2-butene as the reactant, a greater fraction of 1-butene intermediate was transformed in cross-metathesis than in the case of cis-2- c/s - 2 - butene /rons - 2 - butene 20 W 60 0 20 W 60 Time (mm) Time (mm) Fig. 1.

The ratio of propene to pentene formed during the transformation of trans-2-butene was close to unity; in the case of ct's-2-butene, however, significantly more propene than pentene was formed. The results obtained over molybdena-alumina reduced with hydrogen and when re-oxidized specially with water (Fig. 2) show similar characteris- tics, i.e. a higher rate of stereoisomerization of ci's-2-butene than of trans-2- butene, and a higher rate of cross-metathesis, closer to a propene/pentene ratio of 1 in trans- than in ct's-2-butene transformation. Different product distributions were obtained, however, over 0.1 g rhenia-alumina (Fig. 3).

The shape of the conversion curves is different in the case of the molybdena- alumina catalysts. The cross-metathesis of 50 - 50% cfs-2-butene + 1-butene and trans-2- butene + 1-butene was carried out over 1.5 g oxidized molybdena-alumina and over 75 mg rhenia-alumina catalysts at 303 K, 13.3 kPa total butene pressure. The mixtures were diluted with nitrogen to 106 kPa. In each case, both stereoisomerization and cross-metathesis were faster in mixtures containing trans-2-butene than in mixtures containing c('s-2- butene (Figs. 4, 5). The rates are not proportional over the two catalysts; the ratio of the rate of cross-metathesis to that of stereoisomerization is sig- nificantly higher over rhenia-alumina. In each case more propenewas formed than pentene. Over Re207/Al203, however, the propene/pentene ratio de- creased with increasing time, and was dependent upon the initial 1-butene/ 2-butene ratio as well. In a 10 - 90% ^rans-2-butene + 1-butene mixture the rate of formation of 2-pentenes was identical with the rate in a 90 -10% mixture (Fig. 6). In a ^rans-2-butene-rich mixture, propene and pentenes were formed in equi- molar quantities; however, much more propene than pentenes was formed in a 1-butene-rich mixture. Similar results were obtained in 20 - 80% and 80 - 20% mixtures. While the propene/pentene ratio depended on the initial com- position of the mixture, the ^r(ms-/ci's-2-pentene ratio was almost indepen- dent of it, and depended only on conversion. The rate of both propene and pentene formation decreased in cis-2- butene + 1-butene mixtures when the initial cis-2-butene content was in- creased (Fig. 7 .

Discussion Molybdena-alumina catalysts In experiments with ci's-2-butene-do and -dg> it was found [6] that over molybdena-alumina inducted by the reactant the formation of trans-2- butene proceeded predominantly via metathesis.

Non-metathetic isomerization was found to proceed via transition states formed on anion vacancies. These vacancies can be selec- tively re-oxidized (poisoned) by water [13]; selective suppression of non- metathetic isomerization may be expected by such treatment. Catalysts with high metathetic selectivity are required in order to deter- mine the relative reactivity of the individual 2-butenes in metathesis. In the case of reduced molybdena-alumina, however, suppression of the non- metathetic isomerization by water treatment was significant, but not corn' plete. Traces of 1-butene, propene and pentene in the products formed over both types of molybdena-alumina indicate (Figs. 1, 2) that metathesis and non-metathetic isomerization took place simultaneously. The composition of the products can be explained by the following reactions: trans^-C^Hy, U, non-metathetic isomerization l-C4Hg c;s-2-C4Hg', cw-2-C4Hg 1-04118 \"*\" 2-C4Hg l-C4Hg : frans-2-C4Hg metathetic isomerization (1) (2) (3) < : > C3H6 + 2-C5Hio cross-metathesis (ct's, trans) Both over unreduced and over specially treated reduced molybdena- alumina catalysts, the total rate of stereoisomerization was higher for cis- than for frans-2-butene as a reactant. Without the tracer experiment, how- ever, it is impossible to determine the fraction of the products formed via metathesis. 176 The formation of propene and pentene in the transformation of 2- butenes is controlled by the rate of both double-bond shift and cross-meta- thesis. Already from these results (Figs. 1, 2) it may be concluded that the rate of cross-metathesis of frans-2-butene + 1-butene is higher than that of ci's-2-butene + 1-butene. A considerably greater fraction of the intermediate 1-butene accumulated in the products of ci's-2-butene than in those of trans- 2-butene. The results obtained for the cross-metathesis of 50 - 50% 1-butene + 2-butenes (Fig. 4) are in agreement with this observation. A higher rate of cross-metathesis was found in the mixture containing trans-2-bvitene than in that containing cfs-2-butene. It should be noted, however, that the initial rate of the simultaneous stereoisomerization is equal to or higher than the initial rate of cross-metathesis. For the exact determination of the reactivity of individual stereoisomers in cross-metathesis, the effect of the other isomer formed should also be considered. Rhenia-alumina catalysts Rhenia-alumina was found to be a much more selective catalyst in the metathesis of n-butenes than molybdena-alumina catalysts [8]. The trans- formation of 1-butene was studied over both catalysts under identical condi- tions. Metathesis and double-bond shift (and consequently the cross-meta- thesis of 1-butenes + 2-butenes) were observed over molybdena-alumina, while the products of metathesis alone were found, however, over rhenia- alumina. It is not surprising that stereoisomerization was observed only in the transformation of 2-butenes over rhenia-alumina (Fig. 3). It may be assumed that this stereoisomerization proceeded exclusively via metathesis. As the total rate of stereoisomerization, in contrast to molybdena-alumina catalysts, is higher for trans- than for cis-2-butene as a reactant, the same statement should be valid for the metathetic stereoisomerization. In the cross-metathesis of 50 - 50% 1-butenes + 2-butenes (Fig. 5), as over molybdena-alumina catalysts, a higher rate was observed in mixtures containing ^-(ws-2-butene than in mixtures containing ct's-2-butene. The rate of simultaneous stereoisomerization was significantly lower than that of cross-metathesis; hence the results obtained were more characteristic of the reactivity of individual stereoisomers than those obtained over molybdena- alumina. In a cis-2-butene + 1-butene mixture, cis- and frans-2-pentene were formed in equimolar quantities; in a trans-2-butene + 1-butene mixture, how- ever, more trans- than ci's-2-pentene was found. The ratio of ^rans-2-pentene/ ci's-2-pentene extrapolated to zero conversion is 3.2 in the case of a mixture containing frans-2-butene, and 1.0 in the case of a mixture containing cis-2- butene. Consequently, in the cross-metathesis of 2-butenes with 1-butene over rhenia-alumina, the trans isomer shows a higher stereoselectivity than the cis isomer. With respect to cross-metathesis, there are three main questions which have to be answered: 177 1. What is the origin of the stereoselective formation of frans-2-pentene from frans-2-butene + 1-butene? 2. How can the formation of more propene than pentene be explained? 3. What is the explanation for the higher reactivity of trans- than ci's-2- butene with 1-butene? Recent studies suggest that metathesis of olefins in heterogeneous as well as in homogeneous catalytic systems proceeds via a non-pairwise mech- anism [4,14,17]. According to this mechanism, olefin coordinated to metal- lacarbene (B, D) and metallacyclobutane (C) are the intermediates or transi- tion states [16-18]: KB HI R.3CH + CH ^=11 11 L^M CH1K2 RI I=^ CH C11L M< ( I t3 R^;H ~<=iLn&^HRz A \\ R, (A) (B) (C) RICH^CH R3 + ; L,,M=CH-R2 (E) Ri-CH=CH R3 4.M-CH-R2 (D) (4) To date, more studies have been devoted to elucidating the mechanism of formation of the first metallacarbenes (A). Discussion of these studies is outside the scope of this work. After induction of the catalyst, the presence of methylidene (F), ethylidene (G) and propylidene (H) carbene transition states is expected in a 1-butene, 2-butene contact catalyst system: L Re=CH2 LnRe^CH-CHa L,,Re=CH-CH2-CH3 (5) (F) (G) (H) Two routes lead to the formation of both propene and 2-pentenes: 1 LnRe=CH CH3 + 1-butene <==^ LnRe=CH2 + 2-pentene 2 LnRe=CH C2H5 + 2-butene <=* L,,Re=CH CH3 + 2-pentene 3 L^Re=CH CH3 + 1-butene <==^ LnRe=CH C2Hs + propenc LnRe=CH2 + 2-butene ^==i LnRe=CH CH3 + propene (6) 178 In order to explain the stereoselective formation of ^rans-2-pentene, routes 1 and 2 have to be considered. According to Basset et al. [19], stereo- selectivity in olefin metathesis is exclusively determined in the intermediate state (C) by the relative stabilities of substituted metallacyclobutanes. The more stable metallacycles are those for which interaction between the sub- stituents in positions C(l) and C(3) is minimized. Four different conformations of metallacy do butane transition states may arise in route 1 (Fig. 8). On the basis of considerations described by Leconte and Basset [10], configuration (IV) with the methyl and ethyl groups in the diequatorial position C(1) C(2) has the lowest energy. This most favoured metallacyclobutane leads to the formation of (rans-2-pentene; hence, in route 1 the preferential formation of trans-2-pentene may be ex- pected both in ^-(ms-2-butene + 1-butene and in ci's-2-butene + 1-butene mixtures. The four possible metallacyclobutanes formed from ct's-2-butene in route 2 (Fig. 9) are different from those formed from ^rons-2-butene (Fig. 10). The conformations of these metallacycles are the same as those described by Leconte and Basset [10] for the metathesis of 2-pentenes. Configuration (VI) with the methyl and ethyl groups in the diequatorial position C(1)- C(3) is the most favoured metallacyclobutane in the case of ci's-2-butene as a reac- tant; this leads to the formation of ct's-2-pentene. In the case of ^rans-2-butene as a reactant, configuration (X) with two methyl and one ethyl group in the triequatorial C(1) C(2) C(3) position is the most favoured; this leads to the formation of frans-2-pentene. As in the metathesis of 2-pentenes, the retention of configuration of the starting 2-butene is determined by route 2.

In the total cross-metathesis process, the effects of the two routes are superposed. Hence in case of cis-2-butene + 1-butene as the reactant, prefe- rential formation of cis-2-pentene via route 2 may be counterbalanced by the trans preference of route 1. The equimolar formation of cis- and trans-2- pentene has been observed by us from a cis-2-butene + 1-butene mixture (Fig. 5). The superposition of the effects of the two routes may lead to the preferential formation of frans-2-pentene even from a cis-2-butene + 1-butene mixture when the contribution of route 1 to the formation of pentenes is higher than that of route 2. This is the case in mixtures containing more 1-butene than 2-butene, when more propylidene (and methylidene) than ethylidene carbene may be formed on the catalyst surface. Formation of more trans- than cis-2-pentene was found by us (Fig. 7) in a 5 - 95% cis-2- butene + 1-butene mixture than in a 95 - 5% mixture. The cis-/^rans-2-pentene ratio decreased further by increasing the conversion, and hence through a decrease in the ci's-2-butene content of the reaction mixture. A trans preference is characteristic for both route 1 and route 2 in the cross-metathesis of trans-2-butene + 1-butene. The ratio of trans-/cis-2- pentene, therefore, should be less dependent on the composition of the reactant mixture than in the case of a cis-2-butene + 1-butene mixture. Experimental results support this hypothesis; the tr<ms-/cis-2-pentene ratio was almost identical in a 90 - 10% mixture to that in a 10 - 90% trans-2- butene + 1-butene mixture (Fig. 6). Different rates in routes 1 and 2 on the one hand and in routes 3 and 4 on the other hand may provide an explanation for the non-equimolar forma- tion of propene and pentenes. The results obtained with mixtures contain- ing cis- or trans-2-butene must be considered separately. In both route 1 and route 3, ethylidene carbene and 1-butene are the initial species. The formation of propene or pentene depends only on the 180 direction of coordination of 1-butene to the carbene. If there is no steric preference in the coordination, equimolar formation of propene and pen- tenes may be expected. Presumably, in reactions of mixtures containing much more 2-butene than 1-butene, there is more ethylidene than methyl- idene and propylidene carbene on the catalyst, and consequently a greater fraction of propene and pentenes should be formed via routes 3 and 1, res- pectively. As can be seen in Fig. 6, with a 90 -10% mixture of ^rans-2-butene + 1-butene the ratio of propene/pentene is close to unity; hence a steric pre- ference in the coordination of 1-butene to the ethylidene carbene cannot be the reason for the non-equimolar formation of propene and pentenes. In routes 2 and 4, 2-butene interacts with propylidene or methylidene carbene, respectively, to form 2-pentene or propene. If the reactivity of methylidene carbene is higher than that of propylidene carbene for some reason, more propene than 2-pentenes should be formed. For the reasons des- cribed above, in the reaction of mixtures containing much more 1-butene than 2-butene, a greater fraction of propene and pentenes should be formed via routes 4 and 2, respectively. The results obtained with a 10 - 90% mix- ture of trans-2-butene + 1-butene (Fig. 6) indicate that a significantly greater amount of propene was formed than of pentene. The higher reactivity of methylidene carbene relative to propylidene carbene may be explained by a difference in the stability of these materials. A more plausible explanation is provided, however, by the suggestion that methylidene carbenes on a solid surface are more readily accessible to 1-butene molecules than propylidene carbenes. For ci's-2-butene + 1-butene mixtures, more propene than pentene was formed both in 5 - 95% and 95 - 5% systems (Fig. 7). This suggests that even in mixtures containing much more ci's-2-butene than 1-butene, the contribu- tions of routes 2 and 4 to the cross-metathesis are much greater than those of routes 1 and 3. If this is true, the number of surface sites with methyli- dene and propylidene carbenes, and consequently the rate of propene and pentene formation, should decrease on decreasing the 1-butene content in the reaction mixture. The results in Fig. 7 support this assumption; the rate of propene (and at the same time that of pentene) formation decreased with increasing initial ct's-2-butene content. It should be noted that in mixtures rich in 1-butene, i.e. when routes 2 and 4 are dominant, the rate of propene and pentene formation is almost identical irrespective of whether c;'s- or (rans-2-butene is the other compo- nent. In the case of frans-2-butene, the rate of 2-pentene formation is indepen- dent of the composition of the reaction mixture (Fig. 6), i.e. the rates in route 1 and route 2 are identical. The rate of formation of propene is some- what decreased with increasing trans-2-butene content, but only to the level of the rate of 2-pentene formation. In the case of ci's-2-butene, however, the rate of formation of both propene and pentene was proportional to the de- crease of 1-butene content, and as a consequence the participation of routes 2 and 4 in cross-metathesis. From this it follows that in the cross-metathesis of ct's-2-butene + 1-butene the rate in routes 1 and 3 is lower than in routes 2 and 4. 181 The question why the reactivity of trans- rather than cis-2-butene with 1-butene is higher can now be restricted to the question as to why the rate in routes 1 and 3 is lower in the case of cis-2-butene than in the case of trans-2- butene. (Remember that in the case of trans-2-butene the rates found in routes 1 and 2 were equal, and similar rates were observed in routes 3 and 4.) This question can be considered in conjunction with another question: why is the rate of stereoisomerization for ct's-2-butene lower than that of trans-2- butene? The metathesis of ci's-2-butene alone can take place via the following two routes: 5 LnRe=CH CH3 + ct's-2-butene <===* L,,Re=CH CH3 + trans-2-butene 6 LnRe=CH CH3 + cis-2-butene <=^ LnRe^CH CHa + ci's-2-butene (7) Similar routes may be written for the metathesis of trans-2-butene. As can be seen, ethylidene carbene transition states are involved in each route where the rate of transformation of ci's-2-butene is lower than that of trans-2- butene. Competition between routes 1, 3, 5 and 6 can provide one explana- tion (amongst others) for the different reactivities. The relative rate of regen- erative metathesis (route 6) compared to the rates in routes 1, 3 and 5 has also to be considered. If this relative rate is higher for ci's- than for trans-2- butene, and the total rates on ethylidene carbene are identical, the rates in routes 1, 3 and 5 should be lower for c;'s- than for trans-2-butene. Determi- nation of the rate of regenerative metathesis, however, requires tracer exper- iments. Although valuable information has been obtained from the cross-meta- thesis of 1-butene and 2-butenes, without tracer experiments, however, it is impossible to obtain an explanation for the preferential reactivity of trans- 2-butene in comparison with ci's-2-butene. Conclusions (1) The stereoisomerization of 2-butenes over molybdena-alumina pro- ceeds both in a metathetic and a non-metathetic manner; hence the higher rate of stereoisomerization for ci's- relative to trans-2-butene is not character- istic of their metathetic reactivity. (2) The preferential formation of trans-2-pentene from trans-2-butene + 1-butene over rhenia- alumina can be explained by the trans preference of both routes leading to 2-pentene; in the case of ci's-2-butene + 1-butene mix- tures, the cis preference of one route is counterbalanced by the trans prefer- ence of the other. (3) The higher rate of formation of propene relative to pentene may be explained by the higher reactivity of the methylidene relative to the propyl- idene transition states towards 2-butene. 182 (4) There is a correlation between the lower reactivity of c;s- relative to frans-2-butene with 1-butene and the lower rate of stereoisomerization of cis- relative to trans-2-butene.
