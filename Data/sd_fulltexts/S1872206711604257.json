DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60425-7 Mesoporous WO 3 Supported Pt Catalyst for Hydrogenolysis of Glycerol to 1,3-Propanediol LIU Longjie 1,2 , ZHANG Yanhua 1 , WANG Aiqin 1 , ZHANG Tao 1, * 1 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian 116023, Liaoning, China 2 Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China Abstract: Mesoporous tungsten trioxide (m-WO 3 ) was prepared using an evaporation-induced self-assembly method and was used as the support of Pt for hydrogenolysis of glycerol to produce 1,3-propanediol. In comparison with commercial WO 3 , the m-WO 3 presents a much larger surface area and better reducibility, which make the Pt particles highly dispersed on the support. At a reaction condition of 180 o C, 5.5 MPa H 2 , and reaction time of 12 h, the Pt/m-WO 3 catalyst afforded 18.0% conversion of glycerol and 39.2% selectivity for 1,3-propanediol, both of which are much higher than those on commercial Pt/WO 3 catalyst. Key words: mesoporous tungsten trioxide; platinum; glycerol; hydrogenolysis; 1,3-propanediol As the increasing production and application of biodiesel, there is a large surplus of glycerol produced as a byproduct (100 kg glycerol is formed for production of 1 tonne biodiesel) during the transesterification of seed oil with methanol [1]. Transformation of glycerol into value-added chemicals can greatly improve economic viability of biodiesel manufacture and supply chain. Various catalytic transformation pathways have been developed for glycerol utilization, such as oxidation to form glyceric acid and dihydroxyacetone [2,3], dehydration to form acrolein [4], hydrogenolysis to form diols [5â€“7], as well as steam reforming to produce H 2 and syngas [8]. Among them, the selective production of high-value 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) via hydrogenolysis of glycerol has attracted a great deal of attention from both academic and industrial societies due to the increasing demand of 1,3-PDO for the manufacture of polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) [7,9â€“17]. Although some homogeneous complexes of noble metals such as Rh, Pd, and Ru were found to be active and selective for the formation of 1,3-PDO from glycerol [18â€“20], the solid catalysts of these noble metals are more preferred owing to their easy recovering. Various solid catalysts have been developed towards the selective production of 1,3-PDO from hydrogenolysis of glycerol. Chaminad et al. [9] showed that a catalyst combina- tion of Rh/C and H 2 WO 4 afforded 1,3-PDO in a yield of 4% and 1,3-PDO/1,2-PDO molar ratio of 2 from a sulfolane solu- tion of glycerol at a reaction condition of 180 o C, 8 MPa, 168 h. Kurosaka et al. [10] employed Pt/WO 3 /ZrO 2 as the catalyst and DMI (1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone) as the solvent to con- duct the reaction, and they obtained 1,3-PDO in a yield of 24% and 1,3-PDO/1,2-PDO molar ratio of about 2 under the reac- tion condition of 170 o C, 8 MPa H 2 , and 18 h. Also with the Pt/WO 3 /ZrO 2 catalyst, Qin et al. [14] reported a higher yield of 1,3-PDO (32%) and a higher 1,3-PDO/1,2-PDO molar ratio (17.7) using a fixed-bed continuous flow reactor. Gong et al. [11] investigated the performance of Pt/WO 3 /TiO 2 /SiO 2 in this reaction and obtained 1,3-PDO in a yield of 7.7% and 1,3-PDO/1,2-PDO molar ratio of 5. With optimized Pt-HSiW/SiO 2 catalyst, Zhu et al. [17] obtained 1,3-PDO in a yield of 31.4%. These studies reveal an interesting pheno- monon, i.e., tungsten seems to be an indispensable component in various catalyst formulations for achieving a high selectivity for 1,3-PDO. In order to understand the crucial role of tungsten oxide in the selective production of 1,3-PDO from glycerol hydrogenolysis, we prepared mesoporous tungsten trioxide (m-WO 3 ) and then deposited Pt on it. The result showed that our Pt/m-WO 3 catalyst was very active and selective for the formation of 1,3-PDO. Under optimal conditions, the selectiv- ity for 1,3-PDO was 39.3% and 1,3-PDO/1,2-PDO molar ratio LIU Longjie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1257â€“1261 was as high as 9.6 at the glycerol conversion of 18.0%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that mesoporous WO 3 has been successfully used as the catalyst support for 1,3-PDO production from glycerol. Mesoporous WO 3 was prepared with an evapora- tion-induced self-assembly method (EISA) using WCl 6 as the precursor and triblock P123 (EO 20 PO 70 EO 20 ) as the struc- tue-directing agent, according to Yang et al. [21]. The m-WO 3 was obtained by calcination of the as-prepared material at 500 o C for 1 h. Pt/m-WO 3 was prepared by incipient wetness im- pregnation of m-WO 3 with H 2 PtCl 6 followed by calcination in air at 400 o C for 1 h and reduction in H 2 at 300 o C for 1 h. For comparison, commercial WO 3 (denoted as c-WO 3 ) was also employed as the support of Pt. The Pt loading was fixed at 2 wt%. Figure 1 presents the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of two different WO 3 materials. The m-WO 3 shows a type IV isotherm with a sharp capillary condensation step at p/p 0 = 0.4â€“0.9 and a well-defined H1-type hysteresis loop, which is characteristic of mesoporous material. It has a bimodel pore size distribution centered at 4 and 7 nm, respectively. On the other hand, the c-WO 3 presents a very broad pore size distribution. The m-WO 3 has a BET surface area of 22 m 2 /g which is more than twice larger than that of c-WO 3 (9 m 2 /g). Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of Pt/m-WO 3 and Pt/c-WO 3 after H 2 -reduction, both of them are composed of two phases: WO 3 (PDF 20-1324) and H 0.53 WO 3 (PDF 72-1712), indicating WO 3 has been partially reduced with the promotion of Pt [22,23]. In addition, metallic Pt phase is also visible and more prominent in the Pt/c-WO 3 , indicating a larger Pt particle size in the latter catalyst. The TEM images in Fig. 3 clearly show the Pt particles in the Pt/m-WO 3 are smaller than 5 nm while they are 10â€“30 nm in the Pt/c-WO 3 catalyst. Moreover, the m-WO 3 presents a spherical morphology with an average particle size of ~ 30 nm. The smaller Pt particle size in the Pt/m-WO 3 can be attributed to the large surface area of m-WO 3 . The catalytic performance of the two catalysts was investi- gated for the hydrogenolysis of glycerol, under the reaction condition of 180 o C, 5.5 MPa H 2 , 12 h, and a catalyst/glycerol mass ratio of 1:4. The liquid products include 1,3-PDO, 1,2-PDO, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, and a small amount of eth- ylene glycol, ethanol and methanol, while the gas products are CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , and C 3 H 8 which are formed by excessive hydro- genolysis. For clarity, table 1 only lists the major products. Although the two catalysts are selective for the formation of 1,3-PDO, the Pt/m-WO 3 is much more active and selective. The glycerol conversion on the Pt/m-WO 3 reached 18.0% and the selectivity for 1,3-PDO was 39.3%.

(a) (b) LIU Longjie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1257â€“1261 ratio of 1,3-PDO to 1,2-PDO was as high as 9.6, which is more than 4 times that over the Pt/c-WO 3 . It was reported that proton and hydride transfer are involved in the formation of 1,3-PDO from glycerol [14,15]. The ability for H 2 heterolytic dissociation into proton and hydride ion depends both on the dispersion of Pt and on the reducibility of WO 3 support. The H 2 -TPR (temperature-programmed reduc- tion) profiles of the two supports before and after loading of Pt are shown in Fig. 4. It indicates clearly that the m-WO 3 is much easier to reduce than the c-WO 3 support. The UV-Vis spectrum (Fig. 5) of the m-WO 3 presents a wide absorption band in the range of 600â€“900 nm which can be ascribed to the presence of oxygen vacancies [24]. The similar absorption band is not found in the c-WO 3 . Therefore, the presence of a large number of oxygen vacancies is probably responsible for the easy re- duction of m-WO 3 . After deposition of Pt, the reduction of both WO 3 supports is promoted further, but the reduction of Pt 4+ to Pt 0 occurs at a lower temperature for the Pt/m-WO 3 due to the high dispersion of Pt on the m-WO 3 support. The high disper- sion of Pt and the reducibility of m-WO 3 will make it easier to form proton and hydride via heterolytic dissociation of H 2 followed by spillover to the support. Upon formation of hy- dride (H â€“ ), it will attack the 2-position of the alkoxide to break the Câ€“O bond and form the 3-hydroxypropoxide carbanion, which is subsequently attacked by proton (H + ) to form 1,3-PDO (Scheme 1). The strong interaction between Pt and mesoporous WO 3 facilitates the heterolytic dissociation of H 2 , with which both the activity for glycerol hydrogenolysis and selectivity for 1,3-PDO are enhanced. In conclusion, we have developed for the first time the mesoporous WO 3 supported Pt catalyst which is highly active and selective for the production of 1,3-PDO from glycerol hydrogenolysis. The high dispersion of Pt and the good re- ducibility of mesoporous WO 3 contribute together to the ex- cellent performance of Pt/m-WO 3 . In comparison with other W-containing mixed oxides supports, the present catalyst will be a good model to study the synergistic effect of Pt and WO 3 in the hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,3-PDO.

COMMUNICATION Mesoporous WO3 Supported Pt Catalyst for Hydrogenolysis of Glycerol to 1,3-Propanediol Longjie LIU a b Yanhua ZHANG a Aiqin WANG a Tao ZHANG a * a Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian 116023, Liaoning, China b Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China * Corresponding author. Tel: +86-411-84379015 Mesoporous tungsten trioxide (m-WO3) was prepared using an evaporation-induced self-assembly method and was used as the support of Pt for hydrogenolysis of glycerol to produce 1,3-propanediol. In comparison with commercial WO3, the m-WO3 presents a much larger surface area and better reducibility, which make the Pt particles highly dispersed on the support. At a reaction condition of 180°C, 5.5 MPa H2, and reaction time of 12 h, the Pt/m-WO3 catalyst afforded 18.0% conversion of glycerol and 39.2% selectivity for 1,3-propanediol, both of which are much higher than those on commercial Pt/WO3 catalyst. 摘要 以金属酞菁为催化剂, 2,5-二羧酸-3,4-二烷氧基噻吩在水相中脱羧, 以较高的产率和纯度制得 3,4-二烷氧基噻吩, 避免了有机极性溶剂的使用, 催化剂重复使用 8 次仍表现出优异的催化性能. 另外, 通过简易的水蒸气蒸馏法即可分离出产物. 该法具有环境友好、操作简易和反应时间短等优点, 是一种制备 3,4-二烷氧基噻吩的绿色方法. Graphical abstract The excellent performance of Pt/mesoporous WO3 catalyst in glycerol hydrogenolysis is shown here. The high selectivity to 1,3-propanediol can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of Pt and WO3.
