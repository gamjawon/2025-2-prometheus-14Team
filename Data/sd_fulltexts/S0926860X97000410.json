The improved activity correlated with a higher relative concentration of strong acid sites as measured by IR. The alkylation experiments were performed with a rather high dilution of butene to be able to investigate the product selectivity for a longer period at high butene conversion. Important changes in the distribution of the trimethylpentanes (TMP) could be observed with time of reaction and were separated into four regions based on catalyst activity. These were the regions of initial activity, high activity, rapid deactivation and complete deactivation. In the high activity period, the fraction of the more spacious and thermodynamically favoured 2,2,4-and 2,2,3-TMP actually increased unlike experiments with fast decay, mainly attributed to kinetic effects such as diffusional limitation in the zeolite pores. The La-EMT-51 was regenerated by burning off coke in air and reused in alkylation under similar conditions as the fresh sample. The catalyst proved to be regenerable with only a slight loss in alkylation activity. Thorough investigations showed that the alkylate selectivity, in particular towards the 2,2,4-TMP among the isooctanes, was improved. * Corresponding author.

Introduction Isobutane alkylation with light olefins gives branched paraffins favourable for the manufacture of high octane gasoline. Presently, the commercial alkylation processes are catalysed by large quantities of hydrofluoric or sulphuric acids. The environmental aspects of these hazardous acids have stimulated comprehensive research on new potential heterogeneous catalysts. Different zeolites, in particular cubic faujasites [1-5], zeolite [6,7] and MCM-22 [6,8,9], are frequently studied for the alkylation reaction. Generally, these zeolites have the disadvantage of rapid deactivation, mainly due to loss of hydride transfer capacity leading to formation of oligomerisate instead of alkylate. Recently, we investigated the alkylation capacity of the hexagonal faujasite (H- EMT) [ 10,11]. H-EMT showed a high activity and selectivity towards alkylation and proved to be regenerable. Furthermore, 40% La exchange of the EMT has been observed to improve the catalyst performance under identical screening conditions [12]. Upon ion exchange, La ions first occupy the supercages as hydrated complexes while during calcination, the La ions tend to migrate to sites in the sodalite cage [13]. A study of a zeolite Y (CeY-98) in a slurry reactor, clearly demonstrated how vital the butene dilution was to the catalyst performance [10]. Both the catalyst selectivity and yield were strongly influenced by the isobutane/ butene molar ratio, and a high stirring speed was essential to achieve optimal reaction conditions. In the present work we combine improved reaction conditions with the superior properties of the hexagonal faujasites as shown in the preliminary investigations [11,12]. This will give an excellent opportunity to investigate the changes in catalyst selectivity at high butene conversion. Addi- tionally, we would like to focus on the effect of regeneration of the La-EMT catalyst. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation and characterisation H-EMT was synthesised according to a slightly modified procedure given by Delprato et al. [14], using 18-crown-6 ether template. Ludox LS and a sodium aluminate solution were mixed together in a Teflon bottle with an ultrastirrer. The crown ether was added and the gel homogenised and placed for one day at room T. Rorvik et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 267-283 269 temperature and for four weeks at 100 to crystallise. The final crystals were separated from the mother liquid by filtration followed by washing and drying. The as-synthesised material was calcined (540 for 5 h in air), exchanged three times with 2 M ammonium nitrate solution at 100 and calcined again to obtain the H- form. 15 g of the ammonium form of EMT was ion-exchanged with a La(NO3)3.6H20 solution to obtain the La-EMT [12]. The exchange was performed by slowly adding the La(NO3)3.6H20 solution to a stirred dispersion of EMT in water (3000 ml) at room temperature and leaving the mixture at 70 for the next 24 h. After filtration, washing, drying and calcination (540 for 5 h in air) the zeolite was ready for testing. The obtained exchange degree of La in EMT can be calculated from microprobe measurements, assuming one La per every three A1 as a maximum (100%). IR investigations were performed using a Perkin-Elmer model 2000 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector and applying a transmission in situ reactor cell (ISRI). The samples were pressed into self-supporting disks (d=l.8 mm, mass 7-10 mg/cm2) and activated/dehydrated under heating to 500 in vacuum. The pyridine was adsorbed at sample temperatures of ca. 100. Physisorbed/H-bonded pyridine was removed at ca. 150 under vacuum for approximately 30 min. Subsequently, the desorption of pyridine as a function of temperature up to 550 was observed and the IR spectra recorded at 150. Sample weights were corrected according to their weight loss measured by TGA (thermogravimetric analyses). TPD measurements were carried out on an AMI-1 instrument (Altamira Instrument) which was controlled by a Hyundai PC-AT. TPD of ammonia was performed according to the following procedure with 200 mg catalyst of particle size 35-70 mesh: Pre-treatment with 30 ml/min He flow up to 540 (rate 7/ min), and saturation of the catalyst surface with 30 ml/min 10% ammonia in a He flow at 200. TPD was carried out with 30 ml/min He flow using the following temperature profile: 200 in 30 min, increasing the temperature from 200 to 540 with 20/min, standby for 15 min at 540, cooling to 100 and calibration of the TCD by sending 7 pulses of 5 ml ammonia. The effluent gas was controlled by a mass spectrometer (on He, NH3 and H20) to avoid problems arising from overlap of areas from NH3 desorption and dehydroxylation of the surface hydroxyls during the experiments. For further control of the dehydroxyla- tion, additional \"blank\" runs were performed using Ar instead of NH3 in the adsorption/desorption sequence described, and increasing the temperature range up to 800. XRD diffractograms were recorded with CuK~ rays within the angle ratio 20=5- 90on an X-ray diffractometer Philips PW 1730 equipped with a Siemens type F monochromator. The MAS NMR spectra were recorded on a VARIAN VRX 300 S WB NMR spectrometer with 7 mm zirconia rotors. For the 29Si MAS NMR spectra the 270 T. RCrvik et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 267-283 following conditions were employed: resonance frequency: 59.6 MHz, sweep width: 14000Hz, pulse width: 8~ts, repetition time: 5 s, number of scans: min. 5000, MAS spinning speed: 4.5 kHz. Conditions for the 27A1 MAS NMR spectra: resonance frequency: 78.2 MHz, sweep width: 50000 Hz, pulse width: 0.5 ~ts, repetition time: 2 s, number of scans: min. 2000, MAS spinning speed: 5.5 kHz. A Quantachrome Monosorb was applied to determine the surface area (BET) and the pore volumes were measured on a Carlo Erba Sorptomatic 1800. 2.2. Alkylation experiments The isobutane/2-butene alkylations were carried out in a 300 ml stirred semi- batch autoclave. TGA measurements were performed in order to determine the moisture content before weighting and predrying of the zeolites in a calcination oven (2 h, 400 in air). 5 g of dry catalyst was placed inside the reactor for 2 h at 200 in nitrogen flow to secure proper dehumidification before isobutane (128 g) was charged together with a small amount of 2,2-dimethyl-butane (1.5 g). The mixture was heated to reaction temperature (80) and 2-butene was fed at 0.087 ml/min for 7-8 h applying a stirring speed of 1120 rpm. Reactants were charged at 2 by a cooled positive displacement syringe pump operated under pressure at constant flow rate. One phase liquid samples were withdrawn regularly and analysed by GC (capillary column from Hewlett Packard HP PNA 50 m.22 mm, i.d. 0.5 ~tm, methylsilicone gum fused silica). Samples were injected directly into the GC for light component analyses. Excess liquid was collected in ice-cooled traps for off-line GC analyses (same type of column) of heavier products and separation of olefins. The amount of 2,3-dimethyl-butane (formed in the reaction) or 2,2-dimethyl-butane (added) was used to standardise the product distribution from both GC runs. Normally, the 2,3-dimethyl-butane formed in the reaction was employed in the calculations, however, when this concentration was below detection limit, the amount of 2,2-dimethyl-butane was used. Further details on experimental set-up and procedures are described elsewhere [10]. 2.3. Regeneration Deactivated La-EMT from two similar runs were mixed together and regener- ated in air by carefully increasing the temperature to avoid structure collapse. The temperature program was set to: 5/min from room temperature to 300, 2/ min further to 400, kept at 400 for 60 min, 2/min up to 450, kept at 450 for 30 min, 2/min up to 550 and kept at 550 for 10 h. XRD was used to confirm the crystallinity after the regeneration. T. Rcrvik et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 267-283 271 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Characterisation The exchange degree of La in EMT was calculated from microprobe measure- ments as 51% (La-EMT-51). All samples were checked by XRD (pure phase of EMT). The physicochemical characteristics of H-EMT, La-EMT-51 and regen- erated La-EMT-51 (RLa-EMT-51) are listed in Table 1. The discrepancy between the 29Si MAS NMR results giving Si/A1 framework ratios around 4 and microprobe measurements showing a Si/A1 bulk ratio of 3.5 suggested the existence of some extra framework A1 in all three samples. This was confirmed by the fractions of octahedrally co-ordinated A1 measured by 27A1 MAS NMR. Theoretical numbers of acid sites for the EMT samples were derived from the framework Si/A1 ratio measured by 29Si NMR, assuming one acid site per framework A1 atom (Table 1). For the La-EMT samples, the theoretical numbers of acid sites were reduced by an amount corresponding to 2/3 of the A1 atoms associated with La (assuming one acid site per La occupying three A1). The NH3 TPD measurements were close to the theoretical values (Table 1) for all samples (experimental precision=+0.2 mmol/g). A slightly higher TPD value for the H- EMT can be explained by small amounts of water due to some residual dehy- droxylation detected by the on-line MS analyses. 3.1.1. IR data Fig. 1 shows the IR spectra in the OH region for the activated H-EMT, La-EMT- 51 and RLa-EMT-51 samples. The band frequencies were practically unaffected by the La exchange and regeneration, and all the catalysts give rise to three bands at around 3630 cm-1 (high frequency band, HFOH), 3545 cm-1 (low frequency band, LFOH) and a weak band at ca. 3735 cm-1. The HFOH and LFOH represent OH groups in the supercage and sodalite cage, respectively, while the band at 3735 cm-1 may originate from silanol groups [5]. After activation, the La ions are Table 1 Physicochemical characteristics of EMT samples Catalyst H-EMT La-EMT-51 Reg.

In accordance, reduced band intensities for both the LFOH bands in the sodalite cage and the HFOH band in the supercage for La-EMT-51 and regenerated La- EMT compared to H-EMT are observed. The spectra of pyridine (in the 1700-1300 cm-1 region) adsorbed on the samples were studied as a function of temperature (150-550). Concentrations of pyridine adsorbed at BrCnsted sites and Lewis sites were derived (Table 2) using integrated intensities for the bands characteristic of pyridine at Br0nsted sites (at about T.

Extinction coeffi- cients derived for pyridine adsorbed on related zeolite structures were used in the calculations [15]. The La exchanged samples showed additional bands at ca. 1445 cm-1 usually assigned to pyridine coordinated to La3+ [12]. As expected, the number of pyridine molecules interacting with BrCnsted acid sites at 150 are lower in both La-EMT-51 samples compared to the H-EMT due to the presence of La ions interacting with the A1 sites (Table 2), in accordance with our previous observations in the OH region. After heating to 550, the concentrations of adsorbed pyridine were reduced to approximately 0.1-0.2 mmol/ g for the samples, indicating that the number of strong acid sites is altered only slightly after La ion exchange and subsequent regeneration. However, a higher ratio of strong to weak acid sites as indicated by our measurements for the La exchanged samples is believed to favour the alkylation reaction [ 12,16]. Normally, it is expected that the introduction of La strengthens the remaining accessible active sites, provided that the La exchange is not too high, by withdrawal of electrons from the framework hydroxyl groups thus making the protons more acidic [17]. Our data suggest further that concentrations of Lewis acid sites are quite similar in these samples (Table 2). 3.2. Alkylation 3.2.1. Product selectivity and activity on La-EMT-51 and H-EMT In Table 3, the results after 7 h alkylation reaction with La-EMT-51 and H-EMT are summarised. La-EMT was most active, converting 84% of the total amount of charged butene which may be explained by the higher fraction of strong acid sites found in the IR investigations. The development of the conversion expressed as total turnover number defined as mole butene converted/mole theoretical acid sites with time is shown by Fig. 2. The maximum possible total turnover number (mole butene charged/mole theoretical acid sites) are included in Fig. 2 to illustrate the deactivation. The theoretical number of acid sites were selected from Table 1, and no further attempt was made to differentiate the sites contribution in alkylation caused by their actual strength and accessibility. Both the catalysts deviate from the 100% curve after approximately 180 rain, and the rates of deactivation were similar. 274 T.

The total amount of alkylate (g C5-C8 paraffins/g dry catalyst) obtained over La- EMT-51 is somewhat larger compared to H-EMT due to the higher conversion of butene (Table 3). Fig. 3 shows the alkylate produced during reaction where H- EMT appeared to be more active in the beginning of the reaction period while La- EMT produced alkylate for a longer period of time. However, these differences were small, and the two catalysts obtained identical alkylate selectivity after 7 h (g C5-C8 paraffins/g 2-butene converted). The fraction of heavy products (C9+ paraffins and olefins) was higher after 7 h on La-EMT (Table 3), but the difference was probably insignificant due to small GC peaks being difficult to detect and integrate. When the alkylate distribution of C5-C7 paraffins, C8 paraffins and C9 paraffins and olefins were followed with time of reaction, both EMTs behaved identically, represented by La-EMT in Fig. 4. The fraction of C9+ increased steeply compared to the formation of pentanes, hexanes and heptanes. The growing amount of heavy products may originate from increased length of molecules with time due to polymerisation/polyalkylation activity and less cracking activity towards lighter products. Cardona et al. [4] deduced from material balance that C9products (and C5-C7 products) result from the transformation of butene alone. This is in accordance with our earlier work where we found that the fraction of C9+ decreased with increasing external molar ratio of isobutane: butene (higher dilution of butene) [10]. According to the IR measurements in our samples, La is located to some extent in the supercages. Consequently, some La may be present in 276 T.

This may lead to parent and La exchanged catalysts producing similar alkylate distributions as observed. Previously, Mostad et al. [12] found that an ion exchange of about 40% La improved the selectivity of the H- EMT catalyst in the alkylation reaction due to formation of less heavy products and more isooctanes, while 80% reduced the catalyst performance. Obviously, the present study suggest that the optimum ion exchange is below 51%. All catalysts undergo constant selectivity loss towards isooctanes during the reaction, shown in Fig. 4, even with a butene conversion almost as high as 100%. However, the formation of isooctenes was extraordinary low (Table 1), suggesting a higher hydride transfer capacity compared to other zeolites tested [ 10,11 ]. This transfer can be limited by deactivation, resulting in oligomerisation instead of alkylation due to desorption of the carbocation by loss of a proton instead of a hydride shift. It is probably the EMTs combination of a relatively open and accessible structure and strong acidic sites that makes it so favourable during isobutane/butene alkylation. The tendency of selectivity loss can also be observed by the continuously decreasing ratio of trimethylpentanes (TMP) to dimethylhexanes (DMHx). Fig. 5 shows the formation of TMP and DMHx on La-EMT-51 with time, being identical to the behaviour of H-EMT. The formation of TMPs terminated after approxi- mately 350 min while the yield of DMHxs increased linearly throughout the T.

DMHx are generally believed to be formed mainly by dimerisation of butene through isomerisation of the 3,4-DMHx carbocation. When the catalyst deactivates, the ability to isomerise the 3,4-DMHx+ is limited resulting in extended formation of 3,4-DMHx [2,3]. Previously, we have shown statistically that the 3,4-DMHx level in the reactor was a direct indication of the stage of catalyst deactivation [10]. Thus, the identical DMHx distribution and formation produced over La-EMT-51 and H-EMT understate the similar rate of deactivation represented in Fig. 2. The normalised distribution of TMP formed on H-EMT and La-EMT-51 are given in Fig. 6(a) and (b), respectively. The selectivity changed rapidly with catalyst activity comparing Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 2. The catalyst activity drops markedly after around 180 min. The changes are after words less pronounced although TMPs are still formed (Fig. 5). Note that these curves very well can be used to study which product is favoured when by investigating the slopes relative to each other. However, accumulation of products in the reactor will give less pronounced changes with time. The development of the TMP distribution may be divided into four regions based on catalyst alkylation activity as depicted in Fig. 6(a) and (b). These are the regions of initial activity (A), high activity (B), rapid deactivation (C) and complete deactivation (D). In region D, there are no more formation of TMPs. In Fig. 7, the reaction network for TMP carbenium ion formation (TMP+) is schematically presented assuming the possibility of 1,3 hydride shifts as presented 278 T.

A schematic representation of the reaction network on TMP carbocation formation (TMP+). in the literature [ 1 ].

C--C--C + C--C=C ~ C--C--C--C--C ~ TMP+ + I I + C C (5) Isobutane self-alkylation (Eqs. (4) and (5)) has been observed in the literature to be responsible for a large part of the 2,2,4-TMP produced [4]. Isobutene is produced first by tert-butyl carbenium ion desorption from an acid site. However, oligomerisation of isobutene is expected to be much faster than isobutene/ isobutane alkylation, and the very low concentration of isobutene might result in a low reaction rate of the self-alkylation compared to isobutane/butene alkyla- tion. 280 T. Rcrvik et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 267-283 The formation of TMPs through oligomerisation reactions can consist of breakdown of oligomeric C~6 products etc., formed by consecutive alkylation and/or oligomerisation [2]: C~- 4- C4 ~ i - C+12, i - C~-6, etc. (6) i - C~-6 ---+ i - C~- 4- i - C8 (7) This oligomerisation/cracking mechanisms gives mainly 2,2,4-TMP out of TMPs [ 18]. H-EMT gave rapid changes in the TMP distribution during region A (Fig. 6(a)). However, the data in region A are not relaiable due to low concentration of products in the beginning of the reaction. In the high activity region (B), on the other hand, noteworthy alteration in the TMP distribution occurs. The relative formation of 2,2,4-TMP was at a minimum and started to rise until the activity diminished in region C. The fraction of 2,3,4-TMP continued to decrease through- out the whole active period, followed by a slight increase during period C. The relative selectivity towards 2,2,3-TMP/2,5-DMHx was growing steadily during regions B before reaching a constant level in region C. 2,3,3-TMP increased in region A, but the relative formation decreased slightly in region B. For several reasons, a high fraction of 2,2,4-TMP is expected to be formed in the alkylation reaction. In the beginning of the reaction H-EMT has very strong sites as measured by IR, and the conversion of butene was 100%. The absence of available butene will lead to extended self-alkylation (Eqs. (4) and (5) forming high amounts of primary 2,2,4-TMP in accordance with previous findings [10]. Also, due to the lowest Gibbs energy of formation, this isomer is thermodynamically favoured and is, in fact conspicuous in liquid alkylation and on a polymeric surface [3]. The normalised distribution of TMPs is as follows: 2,2,3-TMP (19%), 2,2,4-TMP (59%), 2,3,4-TMP (11%) and 2,3,3-TMP (11%) [19]. In reality, the initial bulk liquid composition of TMPs in region B is similar to the general observations on less active faujasites or those investigated under more severe reaction conditions (fast deactivating), producing high fractions of 2,3,3- and 2,3,4-TMPs (Fig. 6(a)). However, unlike the experiments with fast decay, the bulk fractions of 2,2,4- and 2,2,3-TMP actually increased with time due to an extended catalyst lifetime indicating a high concentration in the pore cavities. The growth in 2,2,3- and 2,2,4- TMP fractions during region B can be attributed to kinetic effects. The more spacious 2,2,3- and 2,2,4-TMP are expected to be slightly hindered in the zeolite structure due to diffusion limitations [ 10] as observed. Furthermore, caused by the diffusion limitation, these compounds have a higher probability to undergo consecutive reactions like Eq. (6). Also, due to H-EMTs high catalyst activity in period B, extended self-alkylation likely occurs, contributing to the increase of 2,2,4-TMP fraction and the subsequent decrease in region C. In the initial period of La-EMT-51 the data were too uncertain for analytical reasons and were excluded. The results from the active period of the catalyst (B) T.

Effect of regeneration of La-EMT-51 The spectroscopic data from Table 1, shows only modest differences between the fresh and regenerated La-EMT-51. Comparing La-EMT-51 and RLa-EMT-51 after 7 h reaction (Table 3), the total conversion of butene was just slightly reduced. During regeneration, the selectivity of the catalyst has improved and changed, shown by the higher selectivity towards alkylate and alternation of the TMP distribution. Here, the 2,2,4-TMP was the major isomer after 7 h of reaction, while the 2,3,3-TMP dominated the product distribution using fresh catalyst. Fig. 8 gives the TMP development with time for RLa-EMT-51. As for La-EMT-51, the data from the initial period were not included. Looking at each isomer, the formation follows the same pattern during the three activity periods as the La- EMT-51. In period B, 2,2,4- and 2,2,3-TMP increase while 2,3,3- and 2,3,4-TMP decrease. In period C the opposite occurs but not as fast. The largest difference was 282 T. Rcrvik et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 267-283 the relative amount of isomers, the 2,2,4-TMP fraction being higher for the regenerated form, possibly due to less diffusional restrictions. 4. Conclusion A 51% La exchanged EMT sample (La-EMT-51) was slightly more active in isobutane/2-butene alkylation compared to the parent H-EMT catalyst. An improved activity correlated with a higher fraction of strong acid sites in the La exchanged samples as measured by IR. On the other hand, quite similar results for alkylate selectivities obtained on both catalysts indicated that a level of 51% La was too high. Selectivity changes over La-EMT-51 and H-EMT could be observed constantly even with a high butene conversion, in particular towards more heavy product and less isooctanes. Due to the extended lifetime of the catalysts operated under high dilution of butene, the development of the trimethylpentane distribution (TMP) could be separated into four regions based on catalyst activity. These were the regions of initial activity, high activity, rapid deactivation and complete deactiva- tion. In the high activity period, the fraction of the more spacious and thermo- dynamically favoured 2,2,4-and 2,2,3-TMP actually increased unlike experiments with fast decay. This was mainly attributed to kinetical effects such as diffusional limitation in the zeolite pores. Furthermore, La-EMT-51 proved to be regenerable in air, with modest loss in alkylation activity. Surprisingly, the alkylate selectivity was somewhat improved, in particular towards the 2,2,4-TMP among isooctanes.

Isobutane/2-butene alkylation was carried out in a semibatch slurry reactor using the hydrogen and lanthanum exchanged form of hexagonal faujasite (EMT, Si Al bulk ratio of 3.5) as catalysts. 51% La exchange in the EMT sample (La-EMT-51) gave a very slight enhanced alkylate activity and yield compared to the parent H-EMT catalyst. The improved activity correlated with a higher relative concentration of strong acid sites as measured by IR. The alkylation experiments were performed with a rather high dilution of butene to be able to investigate the product selectivity for a longer period at high butene conversion. Important changes in the distribution of the trimethylpentanes (TMP) could be observed with time of reaction and were separated into four regions based on catalyst activity. These were the regions of initial activity, high activity, rapid deactivation and complete deactivation. In the high activity period, the fraction of the more spacious and thermodynamically favoured 2,2,4-and 2,2,3-TMP actually increased unlike experiments with fast decay, mainly attributed to kinetic effects such as diffusional limitation in the zeolite pores. The La-EMT-51 was regenerated by burning off coke in air and reused in alkylation under similar conditions as the fresh sample. The catalyst proved to be regenerable with only a slight loss in alkylation activity. Thorough investigations showed that the alkylate selectivity, in particular towards the 2,2,4-TMP among the isooctanes, was improved.
