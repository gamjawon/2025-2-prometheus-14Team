In this work, flower-like spherical, sea urchin-like and tubular MnO2 are prepared via hydrothermal synthesis and used as promoters of iron-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) catalysts to investigate their morphological effects. It is found that the different morphology of MnO2 exhibits observably distinct promotion functions on iron-based FTS catalysts. Tubular MnO2 contains moderate amount of surface oxygen vacancies accompany with weak Fe-Mn electronical interaction, as a result, tubular MnO2 promotes the formation of long-chain hydrocarbon and olefins, and restrains the generation of CH4. Flower-like spherical MnO2 presents negative roles in the CO conversion and formation of long-chain hydrocarbon, due to its insufficient oxygen vacancies and moderate Fe-Mn electronical interaction. With the most abundance of oxygen vacancies and strongest Fe-Mn interaction, sea urchin-like MnO2 modified catalysts exhibits the highest initial CO conversion, but deactivates rapidly. Besides, the sea urchin-like MnO2 enhances the formation of long-chain paraffins. This work presents new insights of the promotion roles of Mn additive, which is beneficial for the rational design of efficient iron-based FTS catalysts.

Fe-based catalysts with the advantages of inexpensive price, positive nontoxicity, excellent water-gas shift (WGS) activity as well as flexible operating conditions, are widely used for FTS reaction [6]. However, some appropriate promoters (K, Na, Cu, Mn, and so on) are normally needed to optimize the electronic properties and geometry of Fe-based FTS catalysts, consequently improving their catalytic performances [7–10]. In particular, Mn, which generally exists in the form of oxides, is considered to be a vital promoter for regulating the structure and electronic properties of Fe-based FTS catalysts, which in turn tunes the FTS performance obviously. Mn promoter was reported to facilitate the formation of χ-Fe5C2 and reduce the selectivity of long-chain hydrocarbon, resulting from the strong Fe-Mn interactions [11,12]. The addition of Mn is also considered to enhance the formation of θ-Fe3C, resulting in improving the light olefins selectivity [13]. In contrast, Li et al. argued that the incorporation of Mn barely changed the light olefin selectivity, but facilitated the generation of heavy hydrocarbons [14]. In addition, the phenomena that the introducing Mn did not affect or reduced the iron carbides formation are also reported [15]. Hence, the intrinsic promotional roles of Mn promoter are continuously ambiguous, further efforts should be made to disclose promotional effects of Mn. Furthermore, the crystals of manganese oxide consist of octahedral units that share angles or edges, thus exhibiting various tunneled and layered crystal structures with various morphologies of MnO2, such as rod-like, wire-like, tubular and spherical shapes [16–18]. These different types of morphology have different physicochemical properties and exhibit different functional catalytic properties. For example, Wang et al. [16]. prepared α-MnO2 in rod, tubular and linear morphology, and investigated its catalytic activity of oxidation of toluene. They found that the rod-shaped α-MnO2 had excellent catalytic performance, which was related to its high oxygen vacancy concentration and good low temperature reduction. Wang et al. [17]. found that silver-modified flower-shaped α-MnO2 possessed excellent catalytic activity towards soot oxidation, due to its multitudinous oxygen vacancies, which can improve the adsorption of reactants. Wu et al. [18]. have found that sea urchin-like microspheres of α-MnO2 showed excellent electrochemical activity in Zn ion batteries. Various precursors of Mn additive (Mn(NO3)2, KMnO4, MnCl₂ and MnSO₄) have been utilized and examined in iron-based FTS catalysts. The promotional roles of various crystal phase MnO2 on Fe-based FTS catalysts have been investigated in our previous work [19]. Nevertheless, morphological effect of MnO2 has never been discussed and remained unknown. In this work, the promotional effect of various morphology of MnO2 (flower-like spherical, sea urchin-like and tubular MnO2) on the performance of Fe-based FTS catalysts is investigated. These unmodified and MnO2 modified catalysts are evaluated under identical reaction conditions. Their chemical properties and structures were analyzed by various characterization methods such as XRD, SEM, XPS, CO-TPR, TPH and MES. The rational structure-performance relationship was obtained according to these obtained results. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalysts preparation The MnO2 with different morphology (tubular, flower-like spherical, sea urchin-like) was named T-MnO2, F-MnO2, and S-MnO2, respectively. They were all prepared via hydrothermal method. In the case of the T-MnO2, 1.10 g KMnO4 was dissolved into the mixed liquid of 100 mL distilled water and 2.39 mL concentrated nitric acid. The obtained homogenous solution was added into an autoclave and maintained at 120 °C for 12 h. In addition, A mixture of 1.58 g KMnO4 and 0.64 g MnSO4·H2O dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water was put into an autoclave and kept at 100 °C for 12 h in order to prepare the F-MnO2. In regard to the S-MnO2, firstly, 0.75 g of MnSO4·H2O was dissolved in 120 mL distilled water, then 3 mL H2SO4 solution was added dropwise and stirred continuously at 60 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, the KMnO4 solution, obtained by dissolving 0.48 g KMnO4 in 30 mL deionized water, was dropped into the above solution. The obtained mixture was also transferred into an autoclave and kept at 120 °C for 10 h. The hydrothermal products were washed by deionized water and ethanol for several times, and dried at 60 °C, 100 °C, 80 °C for 24 h for T-MnO2, F-MnO2, and S-MnO2, respectively. Finally, all of the dried product was calcined at 350 °C for 2 h. The Fe3O4 nanoparticle was prepared by precipitation. the 500 mL mixed solution containing 6.95 g FeSO2·7H2O and 5 g PVP was stirred at 90 °C for 1 h. Then 20 mL NaOH solution was added by dropwise into the above solution. The precipitated solution was stirred for 4 h and stood for 30 min. The precipitate was washed and subsequently dried at 100 °C for 12 h in a vacuum environment. These MnO2 promoted Fe3O4 catalysts were fabricated by physically mixing method. The powders of Fe3O4 and MnO2 were grinded to be smaller than 100 mesh. Subsequently, the two powders were mixed and repeatedly grinded, then they were pressured to pieces. Afterwards, they were sieved to granules with the size between 20 and 40 meshes. The mass fraction of Mn in MnO2 promoted Fe3O4 were remained at 10 wt%. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of sample were obtained on Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (German). The SEM images were obtained from SU8220 (Hitachi, Japan). A MR-351 constant acceleration Mossbauer spectrometer (FAST, Germany) was used to record Mössbauer spectra (MES). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were carried out using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AXIS ULTRA) from Kratos Analytical ltd. The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) or hydrogenation (TPH) were performed by using AutoChem II 2910 (Micromeritics). In the case of CO-TPR, 50 mg catalyst was reduced by a flow of 10 vol.% CO/He from 50 to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. For the TPH, the catalysts were carburized at 350 °C for 10 h by using a flow of 10 vol.% CO/He. After carburization, the catalysts were treated by He flow and cooled to 50 °C, then switched to 10 vol.% H2/Ar and heated to 900 °C at the rate of 10 °C/min. A mass spectrometer (HPR-20, HIDEN) was used to capture the CH4 product during the temperature-programmed hydrogenation process. 2.3 Catalytic performance The catalytic performance of these catalysts investigated was evaluated under reaction conditions of 10 %N2/45 %H2/45 %CO, 320 °C, 5400 h−1, and 1.0 MPa in fixed-bed reactor. Before reaction, the catalyst was reduced in CO at 350 °C for 10 h. The gaseous products were detected by an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent GC 6820) while liquid products were captured by using an ice trap and analyzed with another Agilent 6820 GC. The CO conversion is calculated by: CO con . = CO in − CO out CO in × 100 % The CO2 selectivity is calculated by: CO 2 sel . = CO 2 out CO in − CO out × 100 % The hydrocarbon selectivity is calculated by: C i H m sel . = i × C i H m CO in − CO out − CO 2 out × 100 % C i Hm: the mole number of the hydrocarbon with i carbons at the outflow. 3 Results 3.1 Characterizations of samples as prepared Fig. 1 shows SEM images of as-prepared MnO2. As shown in Fig. 1a and d, a typical hollow nanotube morphology is observed for T-MnO2. The F-MnO2 presents a flower-like structure formed via assembly of nanosheets (Fig. 1b and e). While the S-MnO2 shows a needle like morphology, which is similar to that of sea urchins (Fig. 1c and f). The results of XRD characterization (Fig. 2 a) indicate that these three different morphologies of MnO2 present α-MnO2 crystal structure. However, as shown in the results of XPS, there are significant differences in surface chemical states. (Fig. 2b and c). According to literatures [20,21], the XPS spectra of Mn2p3/2 can be well deconvoluted into two peaks, which is belonged to Mn3+ and Mn4+, respectively. More importantly, the ratio of Mn3+/Mn4+ can be used as vital indicator of surface oxygen vacancy [22,23]. As summarized in Table 1 , the ratios of Mn3+/Mn4+ increase in the order of F-MnO2 < T-MnO2 < S-MnO2. Also, the ratios of Oads/Olatt increase in the same order (Fig. 2c and Table 1). Hence, these different morphology MnO2 possess diverse amounts of surface oxygen vacancy, the amounts of surface oxygen vacancy incline in order of F-MnO2, T-MnO2, S-MnO2. In addition, the different morphology MnO2 promoted Fe3O4 catalysts were fabricated via physically mixing method. It indicates that MnO2 promoters are highly dispersed in catalysts due to the absence of MnO2 diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns of these modified Fe3O4 catalysts (Fig. 2d). 3.2 Characterizations of the activated catalysts The reduction and carburization behavior of MnO2 modified Fe3O4 catalyst was investigated by using CO-TPR. As shown in Fig. 3 a, two observable peaks at about 580 and 800 °C are detected for Fe3O4, which are classified as the reduction and carburization of Fe3O4 by CO [24]. For these MnO2 modified catalysts, except for the high temperature reduction and carburization peaks of Fe3O4, an additional peak in low temperature range of 300∼400 °C is observed, which is belonged to the reduction of MnO2 to MnO [25]. In addition, the MnO2 modification makes the reduction and carburization peaks move to low temperature, implying the enhancing reduction and carburization behavior of iron oxide. However, the diverse morphology MnO2 show different promotion effect, the enhancing effect on the reduction and carburization increases in tendency of T-MnO2 < F-MnO2 < S-MnO2. The promotional effects of different morphology MnO2 on the reduction and carburization behavior are probable due to their rich oxygen vacancies. The XPS results of MnO2 reveal that rich oxygen vacancies exist on MnO2 surface. The presence of oxygen vacancies is advantageous for the activation and dissociation of CO. Wang et al. [26,27] have reported that the oxygen vacancies in MnO x promote the dissociation of CO by spillover of dissociative O from the Fe site to oxygen vacancy site in Fe-Mn catalysts. Nawaz et al. [28,29] also considered that oxygen vacancy enhanced the CO chemisorption and consequently promoted the carburization of iron oxides. XPS was used to analyze the surface chemical state of these activated catalysts. The results are displayed in Fig. 3b and c, the typical Fe3O4 peak at the binding energy of 710.2 and 723.4 eV, and the Fe x C peak at around 706.1 eV are observed from the Fe 2p spectra (Fig. 3b), indicating the coexistence of Fe3O4 and Fe x C on the surface of activated catalysts. Compared to the intensity of Fe3O4 peak for the unmodified catalysts, that for these MnO2 modified catalysts declines evidently, while the peak intensity of Fe x C increases, evidencing the enhanced carburization by MnO2 modification. Besides, a shift towards lower binding energy can be observed with the modification of MnO2, the shifting extent increases in tendency of T-MnO2 < F-MnO2 < S-MnO2. Simultaneously, an opposite variation trend is observed for the binding energy of Mn2p (Fig. 3c). The variation of binding energy for Fe2p and Mn2p implies the existence of strong electronical interactions between Fe and Mn, resulting in electron enrichments of Fe species with the modification of MnO2. The phase composition of the activated catalysts was characterized by XRD. As shown in Fig. 4 a, obvious characteristic peaks of Fe3O4 are observed for all these activated catalysts, but the peak intensity of Fe3O4 decreases observably with the modification of MnO2. In addition, the diffraction peaks located in the range of 40∼47° ascribed to iron carbides (χ-Fe5C2 and θ-Fe3C) are also observed for these activated catalysts, further confirming the co-existence of Fe3O4 and iron carbides. The quantitative analysis of phase composition for these activated catalysts was further characterized by Mössbauer spectroscopy (MES). The MES spectrum and fitting parameters are displayed in Fig. 4b and Table 2 , respectively. As summarized in Table 2, the unmodified Fe3O4 catalyst possesses 45.2 %, 38.0 %, 11.9 % of Fe3O4, χ-Fe5C2 and θ-Fe3C, respectively. The total content of iron carbides (χ-Fe5C2 and θ-Fe3C) is 49.9 % for unmodified Fe3O4, while the content of iron carbides (χ-Fe5C2 and θ-Fe3C) for T- and F-MnO2 modified catalysts inclines to 56.4 and 67.6 %, respectively. The amount of iron carbide is further improved remarkably to 92.8 % for the S-MnO2 modified catalyst. The carburization of these MnO2 modified and unmodified Fe3O4 catalysts detected by XRD and MES agrees well with that observed by CO-TPR. Hence, the oxygen vacancies of MnO2 play a significant role in promoting the carburization of iron oxides. The TPH was used to investigate the surface Fe-C interaction over these catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4c, an intensive peak at around 550 °C along with a broad shoulder in the range of 600∼750 °C is detected for all these catalysts. Notably, the MnO2 introducing shifts the peak position to high temperature. The peak temperature inclines in the order of unmodified Fe3O4, T-MnO2-Fe3O4, F-MnO2-Fe3O4, S-MnO2-Fe3O4, implying that the surface Fe-C bond strengthen in the same trend. The strengthening Fe-C bond is resulted from the Fe-Mn electronical interactions. The strong Fe-Mn electronical interaction leads to electron enrichments of Fe species, which facilitates the formation of strengthened Fe-C bonds [30]. 3.3 Catalytic performance The results of catalytic evaluation are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 3 . As shown in Fig. 5a, the CO conversion of unmodified Fe3O4 starts from 32.9 %, slowly decreases to around 24 % and then maintains stable for the rest of reaction times. With the modification of different morphology MnO2, CO conversion changes observably. The F-MnO2-Fe3O4 exhibits similar variation tendency of CO conversion to unmodified Fe3O4. The T-MnO2-Fe3O4 presents a much higher initial CO conversion of 40.0 % and then maintains a stable CO conversion at around 35 %. For S-MnO2 modified catalyst, the highest initial CO conversion of 73.1 % is obtained, however, after reaction for a short time of 9 h, its CO conversion declines rapidly within 7 h to about 8 %. Except for the CO conversion, the promotion of diverse morphology of MnO2 also regulates the product distribution observably. As shown in Fig. 5b and summarized in Table 3, the unmodified Fe3O4 gives 26.5, 37.0, and 36.5 % selectivity of CH4, C2–4, and heavy hydrocarbon (C5 +), respectively. In addition, a ratio of olefin/paraffin for C2–4 is 3.5 for unmodified Fe3O4. By contrast, the CH4 selectivity is decreased to18.8 %, while the selectivity of C5 + and olefin/paraffin ratio is improved for the T-MnO2 modification Fe3O4. However, for F-MnO2 modified Fe3O4, the CH4 selectivity is inclined notably to 39.0 %, accompany with an obvious decrease of C5 + selectivity. For S-MnO2 modified Fe3O4, the lowest selectivity of CH4 and highest selectivity of C5 + is obtained, but the olefin/paraffin ratio is decreased to 0.5. As proposed by Niemantsverdriet et al. [31,32], the catalytic activity of Fe-based FTS catalysts is depended on their active sites on surface. For different morphology MnO2, their surface oxygen vacancies are in obvious differences. The amounts of surface oxygen vacancies incline in tendency of F-MnO2, T-MnO2, S-MnO2, as evidenced by the results of XPS. The sufficient oxygen vacancies would enhance dissociative adsorption of CO. In addition, the strong Mn-Fe electronical interactions are established, which in turn results in electron-enriched Fe species as revealed by the results of XPS. The Mn-Fe electronical interaction is strengthened in the tendency of T-MnO2 < F-MnO2 < S-MnO2. The electron-enriched Fe would strengthen surface Fe-C bonds, confirming by the results of TPH. The strengthening surface Fe-C bonds would enhance the generation of bulk iron carbides, but may not favor the conversion of CO. The strengthening surface Fe-C bonds improves the residential time of surface carbon species, which occupy the surface active sites for a long time and in turn inhibit the catalytic recycles, consequently decreasing the CO conversion. T-MnO2 possesses moderate amount of oxygen vacancies and the weakest Fe-Mn electronical interaction. As a result, an increasing CO conversion is observed for T-MnO2 modified Fe3O4. In contrast, F-MnO2 has the less amount of oxygen vacancies and moderate Fe-Mn electronical interaction. Thus, the modification of F-MnO2 shows faint effects on the CO conversion. For S-MnO2 promoted Fe3O4, S-MnO2 contains the richest oxygen vacancies, resulting a high initial CO conversion. Simultaneously, the strongest Fe-Mn interaction exists in S-MnO2 modified Fe3O4. The strongly strengthened surface Fe-C bond easily leads to carbon deposition, hence, a rapid deactivation can be observed for S-MnO2 modified Fe3O4. For the selectivity of products, the moderate amount of oxygen vacancies of T-MnO2 will improve the abundance of surface carbon species, facilitating the chain growth reaction. Meanwhile, the weak surface Fe-C bond is beneficial to formation of olefins. Therefore, an increase of selectivity towards C5 + and olefins is detected for T-MnO2 modified Fe3O4 catalyst. The decrease of C5 + selectivity for F-MnO2 modified Fe3O4 may result from the least abundance of surface carbon species, because F-MnO2 contains the least amount of oxygen vacancies. In contrast, the most abundant of oxygen and strongest Fe-Mn interaction exists in S-MnO2 modified Fe3O4 catalyst, therefore, the increasing selectivity of C5 + but decreasing selectivity of olefins is obtained. 4 Conclusions The different morphology of MnO2, including flower-like spherical, sea urchin-like and tubular MnO2, shows notably distinct promotion functions on iron-based FTS catalysts. Tubular-like MnO2 promotes the formation of long-chain hydrocarbon and olefins, and restrains the generation of CH4, because its moderate amount of surface oxygen vacancies and weak Fe-Mn electronical interaction. Flower-like spherical MnO2 decreases the CO conversion and selectivity of long-chain hydrocarbon, due to its insufficient oxygen vacancies and moderate Fe-Mn electronical interaction. With the most abundance of oxygen vacancies and strongest Fe-Mn interaction, sea urchin-like MnO2 modified catalysts exhibits the highest initial CO conversion, but deactivates rapidly. Besides, the sea urchin-like MnO2 enhances the formation of heavy paraffins. This work gives new view of morphological effect of MnO2 promoter, which is helpful for the reasonable design of efficient Fe-based FTS catalysts.

        "dc:description": "In this work, flower-like spherical, sea urchin-like and tubular MnO2 are prepared via hydrothermal synthesis and used as promoters of iron-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) catalysts to investigate their morphological effects. It is found that the different morphology of MnO2 exhibits observably distinct promotion functions on iron-based FTS catalysts. Tubular MnO2 contains moderate amount of surface oxygen vacancies accompany with weak Fe-Mn electronical interaction, as a result, tubular MnO2 promotes the formation of long-chain hydrocarbon and olefins, and restrains the generation of CH4. Flower-like spherical MnO2 presents negative roles in the CO conversion and formation of long-chain hydrocarbon, due to its insufficient oxygen vacancies and moderate Fe-Mn electronical interaction. With the most abundance of oxygen vacancies and strongest Fe-Mn interaction, sea urchin-like MnO2 modified catalysts exhibits the highest initial CO conversion, but deactivates rapidly. Besides, the sea urchin-like MnO2 enhances the formation of long-chain paraffins. This work presents new insights of the promotion roles of Mn additive, which is beneficial for the rational design of efficient iron-based FTS catalysts.",
