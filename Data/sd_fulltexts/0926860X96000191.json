P.O. Box 700, Cluj-Napoca 5, Romania Received 2 November 1995; revised 27 December 1995; accepted 27 December 1995 Abstract Two series of Ni/Cr203 and Ni/A1203 catalysts were prepared by the coprecipitation method and heat-treated at temperatures between 350 and 1050 in hydrogen atmosphere. BET surface area, metal dispersion and catalytic activity for deuterium exchange reaction between hydrogen and water vapour were measured. The effect of the heat treatment on the catalyst properties is strongly dependent on the support nature: for Ni/Cr203 catalysts the metal dispersion, as well as the intrinsic activity are severely affected, while for Ni/AI203 catalysts the metal dispersion is decreased, but only a weak effect on the intrinsic activity is observed. The low stability of the Ni/Cr203 samples is due to the weak metal-support adhesion and, at the same time, to the collapse of the chromia surface area during the thermal treatment. In the case of the Ni/AI203 samples the metal-support interaction is strong and, also, the alumina surface area is decreased gradually during the heat treatment. The results provide arguments for the model invoking the creation at the nickel-support interface of new highly active sites for the deuterium exchange reaction between hydrogen and water vapour.

Ohtriu / Applied Catalysis A: Genelz~l 140 (1996) 59 72 It is catalysed by Group VIII metals which adsorb the hydrogen molecule dissociatively [1,2]. As regards nickel catalysts, the activity per gram of catalyst, rg, for reaction (1), is strongly dependent on the presence and nature of the support [3-7]. The support plays an essential role in increasing the catalytic activity per metal surface area unit (the intrinsic activity), r~, in comparison with that of the nickel black [4-7]. The highest effect was reported for TiO2 and ZrO2, increasing the intrinsic activity approximately three orders of magnitude [7]. Among the catalysts with highest rg value for reaction (1) coprecipitated Ni/Cr203 [3,6-8], Ni/AI203, Ni/ZrO2 [7] and Ni/AlzO3-Cr~O~ [9] samples, with high nickel content (e.g. 85 at.-% Ni), should be mentioned, exhibiting high metal surface area per gram of catalyst, SN~, as well as high intrinsic activity values. The metal supported catalysts can suffer from degradation effects during the reduction with hydrogen or operation [10,11]. The thermal degradation may be attributed to the metal sintering or to causes of different nature [12]. The effect of the metal sintering on the catalytic properties can be different as a function of the catalytic reactions involved [13]. Thus, due to increasing of metal crystallite sizes by sintering, the intrinsic activity is: (i) increased for the CO oxidation on Pt/A1203 catalyst [14], (ii) constant for the CO hydrogenation on Ni/A1203 catalysts [15], and (iii) strongly decreased for the ethane hydrogenolysis on the Ni/SiO2-A1203 catalyst [16]. In literature there are no data on the influence of the treatment temperature of the nickel catalysts on the rate of the reaction (1). The aim of the present paper is to investigate the nature of the nickel catalyst deactivation during the heat treatment in a broad range of temperatures in a hydrogen atmosphere. For this purpose two series of nickel/chromia and nickel/alumina catalysts, with different nickel content (85, 70 and 60 at.-% Ni), were prepared by the coprecipitation method. For all catalyst samples the BET surface area, St, metallic surface area, and intrinsic activity for the reaction (1) were measured. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts All catalyst samples were prepared by the coprecipitation method. To obtain Ni/Cr203 catalysts, the coprecipitation was carried out at room temperature by addition of a solution containing a mixture of nickel and chromium nitrates (ca. 0.5 molar) to a sodium carbonate solution (ca. 1 molar) with vigorous stirring. The ratio between nitrates was chosen in such a way to obtain the desired atomic percentage of nickel, defined by X = at. Ni/(at. Ni + Cr)) 100%. Both Ni(II) and Cr(III) quantitatively precipitated during preparation allowing in this way to obtain the catalyst samples with initially determined Ni/Cr atomic ratios. The P. MSrginean, A. Olariu /Applied Catalysis A: General 140 (1996) 59-72 61 Ni/AI203 catalysts were prepared in the same way by coprecipitation of a solution containing a mixture of nickel and aluminum nitrates. The freshly precipitated sample was filtered and washed with doubly distilled water. Be- cause the sodium ions act as a poison on the nickel activity [3], they were thoroughly removed by repeating (6-8 times) the cycle of stirring with doubly distilled water, followed by filtering. With this caution it has been checked that the intrinsic activity of the samples prepared with sodium carbonate was practically the same as that using ammonia solution as precipitant agent. The sample was dried at 105, calcined in a stream of nitrogen at 340 and reduced in flowing hydrogen at 350. Then the catalyst was passivated at room temperature in flowing nitrogen with low oxygen concentration (ca. 0.2%). The catalyst samples were reactivated prior to use by reduction in situ, in hydrogen flow, at 350. The chromia and alumina samples were obtained from nitrate solutions by precipitation with ammonia solution. The heat treatment of the catalyst and support samples was performed in an electrical furnace, in a hydrogen stream, for 3 h at a given temperature. 2.2. Characterization The BET surface area of the samples was measured in an all glass apparatus, using krypton adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature. The average deviation in the total surface area values was typically 2% or less. The metallic surface area of the catalyst samples was measured by hydrogen chemisorption in an all glass apparatus. The sample of previously passivated catalyst (ca. 2 g) was reduced overnight at 350, in hydrogen flow (150 cc/min) and vacuum pumped 5-6 h until a final pressure lower than 10 5 Torr (1 Torr = 133.33 Pa) was attained. The measurements for the adsorption isotherm at room temperature and pressures up to 220 Torr were then performed. It was found that 1 h is sufficient to reach an equilibrium, as determined from adsorption-time data. The reduction-evacuation-adsorption cycle was repeated until a constant and reproducible value of the surface area was obtained (average deviation less than 2%). The back extrapolation of the saturation region of the hydrogen adsorption isotherm was done and the intercept at zero pressure was taken as monolayer uptake. The metallic surface area was calculated assuming that: (i) one hydrogen atom is chemisorbed on each surface metallic nickel atom, and (ii) each nickel atom occupies 6.5 ~2 [17]. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) was carried out in a Linseis Thermobal- ance, in hydrogen flow. Chromia and passivated Ni/Cr203 catalysts (ca. 300 mg) were heat-treated at 350 until a constant weight was achieved after which DTA and weight loss were recorded in the range 350-950 at a constant heating rate (5/min). c~-A1203 was used as inert reference for DTA. The catalytic activity was measured in a dynamic reactor, at atmospheric pressure, as previously described [4,18]. The catalyst sample was ground to 62 P. Marginean, A. Olariu /Applied Catalysis A: General 140 (1996) 59- 72 powder and diluted with sintered silica powder, in order to avoid disturbing effects due to diffusion into the catalyst grain and diffusion along the catalyst bed. The catalyst sample was first re-reduced in situ under hydrogen flow, at 350. After 2 h, the reactor was cooled to room temperature. The hydrogen flow, containing about 50 ppm deuterium {analyzed by mass spectrometry), was bubbled through a heavy water solution containing about 4 at.-% deuterium and passed through the catalyst bed. The heavy water solution {analyzed by optical interferometry) was prepared starting from 99.85 at.-% 2H heavy water {analyzed by IR spectroscopy) and doubly distilled water containing 144 ppm deuterium {analyzed by mass spectrometry). 63.5 and 79 were selected as saturation and reaction temperatures, respectively. In these conditions the undesired effect of capillary condensation is prevented. The deuterium content in the hydrogen flow, at outlet, was measured on-line using a gas chromatograph equipped with a 1.5-m column (molecular sieve 5 ,~) and a thermal conductivity detector {sensitivity ca. 20 ppm deuterium). The results were plotted according to the appropriate reversible first-order equation in order to obtain the rate constant. The reproducibility of the measurements was checked performing duplicate experiments for each catalysts. The average deviation in rate data was about 5%. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Effect of heat treatment on Ni / Cre O~ catalyst properties The data obtained on Ni/Cr203 samples heat-treated in the range 350- 1050, are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the SN~ value diminishes as the treatment temperature increases. At the same treatment temperature the increase of chromia content results in a less sharp decrease of the Syi value. The total surface area also diminishes as the treatment temperature increases. Also, it can be seen that the catalytic activity, rg, decreases approximately four orders of magnitude when the 85 at.-% Ni sample was thermally treated up to 1050. On the other hand, for the same catalyst sample, the intrinsic activity r~, remains unchanged at the characteristic value of the nickel/chromia catalysts (ca. 2.0 10-s mol IH2H/m~i s) [7], in the treatment temperature range 350- 435. However, a further temperature increase to 450 results in a sudden diminution of the r~ value. Furthermore, with the increasing of the chromia content in the sample, the diminution of the r~ value becomes less severe at a given treatment temperature. Despite the fact that the crystallite size and intrinsic catalytic activity seem to be correlated, it is not possible to establish a relationship at this low exposition fraction of metal [19]. However, another correlation can be established. The BET surface area of the chromia sample heat-treated in hydrogen, at various temperatures, shows the same pattern {Fig. 1, dashed line) as the r~ value of the P. M8rginean, A.

Ni/Cr203 sample with 85 at.-% Ni, heat-treated in the same conditions (Fig. l, full line). The sudden decrease of the specific surface area of chromia, which occurs at about 450, can be explained taking into account that the amorphous chromia suddenly crystallizes at this temperature, as it is known since long time [20]. It follows that there is a close relationship between the crystallization of amorphous chromia and the sudden decrease of the intrinsic activity value of the chromia supported nickel catalysts for reaction (1). Chromia surface area per gram of support from the catalyst samples, S~ (calculated from the difference St -SNi normalized to the chromia weight content), is also given in Table 1. The temperature dependence of Ss reveals that a crystallization process of chromia occurs at about 450 similarly to pure chromia. The crystallization of chromia has also been evidenced using differen- 64 P. M#rginean, A.

The thermogravimetric analysis of our samples shows that the exothermic peak is not accompanied by a weight loss, which means that only a structural change occurs. On the other hand, as it was shown previously, the interaction between the metallic nickel and chromia in Ni/Cr203 catalysts is weak [7]. As a consequence of the low adhesion between metal and chromia, this system shows a segregation tendency. In a previous paper [7] we assumed that the nickel-support interface is more active for reaction (1) than the surface of nickel black. In order to explain the role of this interface it should be noticed that both hydrogen and water have to be activated in order to allow reaction (1) to take place. While being able to activate hydrogen via dissociative chemisorption, the surface of nickel black, covered with chemisorbed hydrogen, is less capable to activate the water molecule [21]. For this reason, the intrinsic activity of the nickel black is very low (3.4 10 s mol 1H2H/m2i s) [7]. When the nickel is deposited on a P. Marginean, A.

The exothermic peak is due to the crystallization of the chromia. support, the two components interact and new sites arise at the metal-support interface. These sites allow a better activation of the water molecule than nickel black. The water molecule is activated at the metal-support boundary, either by the perturbed nickel surface or by the support surface through its hydroxyl groups. As a consequence, the catalytic activity at the nickel-support interface is enhanced. This assumption is now reinforced by the behaviour of the sintered Ni/Cr203 catalysts. At low chromia content (15 at.-% Cr) the metal-support contacts are numerous and the intrinsic activity remains high at a constant value as long as chromia is finely dispersed. As a consequence of the crystallization and segrega- tion of the chromia at ca. 450, the perimeter of the metal-support interface is diminished and the r, value suddenly decreases. At higher treatment tempera- tures, the chromia continues to agglomerate and to segregate, resulting in a further diminution of the perimeter of the nickel-support interface and this leads to a gradual decrease of the intrinsic activity towards the characteristic value for the nickel black. In the case of the catalyst samples with higher support content, a greater amount of chromia is available to build up the nickel-support interface and therefore the effect of the crystallization and segregation is partially compen- 66 P.

As a consequence, the r~ value decreases more slowly with increasing treatment temperature, as can be seen from Table 1. In order to check the model invoking the very active sites for reaction (1) at the nickel-support boundaries, the total perimeter of the metal-support interface per gram of catalyst, lg, was estimated (see Appendix) and compared with the catalytic activity per gram of catalyst, rg. In Table 2 the values of the Ig and of the ri = rg//8 are reported. The interface perimeter value is changed by heat treatment, more than three orders of magnitude, while the activity of the perimeter unit is approximately constant with an average value of ri = (4.7 + 2.0) 10-~3 tool 1HZH/m s (the ri values of the samples 85Ni15Cr at.-%, heat-treated at 1050, and 70Ni30Cr at.-%, heat-treated at 950, can be considered as deviated data and are not included in the calculated average). The experimental data reported here for the Ni/Cr203 catalysts show that the activity value rg is directly proportional to the interface perimeter in a large range of Ig values, which is in very good agreement with the above discussed model.

Examples of reactions for which the catalytic activity is enhanced, or the selectivity modified at the metal-support interface are quoted in literature. In this manner the intrinsic activity is enhanced for the CO hydrogenation [22,23] (and quotations therein), CO oxidation [24], water-gas shift reaction [25], toluene steam dealkylation [26-29], and the intramolecular selectivity is modi- fied for the acetophenone hydrogenation [30]. 3.2. Effect of heat treatment on Ni / A120s catalyst properties In Table 3 the data obtained for Ni/A1203 catalysts heat-treated at tempera- tures 350-1050 in hydrogen are reported. The SNi and St values are both lowered when the treatment temperature increases. As compared with the Ni/Cr203 catalysts, although the behaviour is similar, the Ni/AI203 system is more resistant to sintering: both SNi and St values show a much lower decrease at a given treatment temperature. Although the activity per gram of sample 68 P. M~rginean, A. Olariu /Applied Catalysis A: General 140 (1996) 59 72 diminishes during the thermal treatment, it is kept high compared to that of the Ni/Cr203 catalysts treated in similar conditions, as shown in Table 3. As regards the intrinsic activity of the Ni/A1203 system it can be seen (column 6) that it is much more stable than the r~ value of the Ni/Cr203 system thermally treated in the same conditions. The intrinsic activity remains unchanged at the characteristic value of the nickel/alumina catalysts (ca. 9.8 10.6 mol 1H2H/m2i s) [7], in a large range of the treatment temperatures. However, the temperature range in which the intrinsic activity remains unaffected by the heat treatment depends on the alumina content. Thus, the r~ value for the 85Ni15A1 at.-% catalyst is diminished in the case of the samples treated at 950 and 1050, while for the 60Ni40A1 at.-% catalyst it remains approximately un- changed over the whole range of the treatment temperature applied. In this last case (60Ni40A1 at.-% catalyst), the SNi value is diminished about seven times by the heat treatment at 1050, compared to its initial value, while the r~ value remains approximately unchanged. This fact also suggests that there is no correlation between the intrinsic activity for reaction (1) and the nickel crystal- lite size, at least in the size range studied in this paper. The higher stability of the Ni/A1203 catalysts compared to that of the Ni/Cr203 catalysts, could be explained by the different behaviour of the two supports during the heat treatment, and a difference in terms of nickel-support adhesion. In order to check the first assumption, alumina samples were heat- treated in hydrogen, in the same conditions as the Ni/AlzO3 catalysts and BET surface area have been measured. As reported in Fig. 3, its value diminishes gradually as the treatment temperature increases, in contrast with the sudden crystallization of the chromia. The alumina from the Ni/AI203 catalysts behaves similarly with alumina sample: its specific surface area, S~, diminishes monotonously as the treatment temperature is increased (Table 3, column 4). As regards the second assumption, the literature data point out a strong adhesion between the metallic nickel and alumina [31]. Concerning the NiO/AI203 system with high nickel content and prepared by coprecipitation method, like our samples, it was shown that during the calcination step, even at relatively low temperatures (330), the components interact and a non-stoichio- metric nickel aluminate is formed together with nickel oxide [32,33]. Recently, the NiO/A1203 precursors were studied and it was concluded that the NiO particles are 'decorated' by nickel aluminate-type patches [34]. After reduction at 500, in the Ni/A1203 catalysts with high nickel content, the presence of the nickel aluminate was evidenced by XRD, TPR [35,36], electron diffraction and high-resolution electron microscopy [37]. It was also proved that the porous nickel aluminate shells decorate the metallic crystallites [37]. The nickel alumi- nate phase persists up to about 800-900 when the Ni2+ species are reduced [38,39]. It seems that in the Ni/AlzO3 samples reduced at higher temperatures, the alumina continues to decorate the nickel crystallites by strong adhesion. The high resistance of the alumina to the thermal treatment and its strong P. M~rginean, A.

Effect of heat treatment on the surface area of the alumina sample. adhesion to the metallic nickel have two positive effects on the Ni/A1203 catalysts: (i) the nickel crystallite growth is partially impeded, so that the SNi value is more stable to the thermal treatment and (ii) the support decorates the nickel crystallites, favouring the existence of the metal-support interface in a large range of the treatment temperatures and as a consequence, the intrinsic activity value shows only a slight diminution, or remains constant in the case of the catalyst with highest alumina content. In Table 4 the values of the interface perimeter per gram of catalyst, Ig, calculated by the same model (see Appendix) and catalytic activity per perimeter unit, q, are reported. For the samples heat-treated at lower temperatures, ri is constant, irrespective of the catalyst composition. For the samples heat-treated at higher temperatures q increases. The temperature at which q begins to change depends on the alumina content of the sample: 650 for 85Ni15A1 at.-%, 850 for 70Ni30AI at.-% and 950 for 60Ni40A1 at.-% catalysts. These are just the temperatures at which the SN~ of the three catalysts is diminished to about 1/2 of its initial value (Table 3). The fact that ri is deviated from a constant value could be explained in terms of the high nickel-alumina adhesion: while the nickel agglomerates by sintering, the alumina (or nickel-aluminate) adheres strongly to metal and porous shells are formed [37]. In this way, the Ig value calculated by the present model is underestimated for the catalyst samples 7(1 P. M8rginean, A.

Conclusions The behaviour of the heat-treated supported nickel catalysts provides addi- tional evidence regarding the role of the metal-support boundaries acting as new very active sites for an interfacial sensitive reaction like reaction (1). Catalyst deactivation during the heat treatment in hydrogen consists of a decrease of both the metal surface area and the intrinsic activity. Chromia supported nickel catalysts are much more sensitive to the heat treatment than alumina supported catalysts. This can be explained by the different behaviour of the two supports during the heat treatment, and also to different nickel-support adhesion. Chromia suddenly crystallizes and segregates, while alumina loses monotonously its specific surface area and does not segregate from nickel crystallites. Therefore, the perimeter of the metal-support interface and thus the P. Marginean, A. Olariu / Applied Catalysis A: General 140 (1996) 59-72 71 number of the new active sites dramatically decreases during the heat treatment in the case of the Ni/Cr203 catalysts. For the Ni/A1203 catalysts the effect is less severe, even absent for the samples with higher alumina content. Appendix A.

Box 700, Cluj-Napoca 5, Romania ∗ Corresponding author. Tel. (+40-64) 184037, fax. (+40-64) 420042 1 Present address: Ministry of Environment, Bulevardul Libertăţii Nr. 12, Bucharest, Romania. Two series of Ni Cr 2O3 and Ni Al 2O3 catalysts were prepared by the coprecipitation method and heat-treated at temperatures between 350 and 1050°C in hydrogen atmosphere. BET surface area, metal dispersion and catalytic activity for deuterium exchange reaction between hydrogen and water vapour were measured. The effect of the heat treatment on the catalyst properties is strongly dependent on the support nature: for Ni Cr 2O3 catalysts the metal dispersion, as well as the intrinsic activity are severely affected, while for Ni Al 2O3 catalysts the metal dispersion is decreased, but only a weak effect on the intrinsic activity is observed. The low stability of the Ni Cr 2O3 samples is due to the weak metal-support adhesion and, at the same time, to the collapse of the chromia surface area during the thermal treatment. In the case of the Ni Al 2O3 samples the metal-support interaction is strong and, also, the alumina surface area is decreased gradually during the heat treatment. The results provide arguments for the model invoking the creation at the nickel-support interface of new highly active sites for the deuterium exchange reaction between hydrogen and water vapour.

        "dc:description": "Two series of Ni Cr 2O3 and Ni Al 2O3 catalysts were prepared by the coprecipitation method and heat-treated at temperatures between 350 and 1050°C in hydrogen atmosphere. BET surface area, metal dispersion and catalytic activity for deuterium exchange reaction between hydrogen and water vapour were measured. The effect of the heat treatment on the catalyst properties is strongly dependent on the support nature: for Ni Cr 2O3 catalysts the metal dispersion, as well as the intrinsic activity are severely affected, while for Ni Al 2O3 catalysts the metal dispersion is decreased, but only a weak effect on the intrinsic activity is observed. The low stability of the Ni Cr 2O3 samples is due to the weak metal-support adhesion and, at the same time, to the collapse of the chromia surface area during the thermal treatment. In the case of the Ni Al 2O3 samples the metal-support interaction is strong and, also, the alumina surface area is decreased gradually during the heat treatment. The results provide arguments for the model invoking the creation at the nickel-support interface of new highly active sites for the deuterium exchange reaction between hydrogen and water vapour.",
