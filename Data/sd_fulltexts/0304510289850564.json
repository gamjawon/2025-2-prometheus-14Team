MEHTA Discipline of Coordination Chemistry and Homogeneous Catalysis, Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute, Bhavnagar 364 002 (India) (Received April 14, 1988; accepted July 28,1988) Summary High-valent metal-oxo complexes of the composition [Ru^H dmg);- (H^OXO)]^, [Ru^Hi-dn^OHKO)]4-*\" where dmg = dimethylglyoximato are formed in situ by the electrochemical oxidation of [Ru^H dn^z- (C104)2]~ in the pH range 1 - 2 and [Ru^H-dmg^HzOKO)]^ and [Ru^\"- (H dmg)2(0)2]\"1\" in the pH range 2-3.5. These intermediates act as catalysts in the electrocatalytic epoxidation of cyclohexene and cyclooctene to the corresponding epoxides. Introduction The study of aquo and oxo complexes of ruthenium and osmium as biomimetic systems for the oxidative enzymatic reactions of cytochrome P-450 oxidase is of current research interest [1-11]. In this regard many model oxidase systems, such as porphyrin complexes with Fe [1-5], Cr [6] and Mn [7], and Fe(III)-EDTA [8], Ru(III)-EDTA [9], Ru(III)-Schiff bases [10] and [Ru(III)(H dmg)2(C104)2r [11] a^ successfully employed for the oxidation of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons through the forma- tion of high-valent metal-oxo complexes as active intermediates during catalytic processes. The active intermediates in all these reactions are generally produced by oxidants such as tl^O^, PhIO, peroxy acids, amine oxides [1 -8] and by dioxygen [9 -11]. This class of coordination compounds, wherein the reactivity can be varied by the formation of an active intermediate, perform selective oxidations and exhibit recyclability in contrast to conven- tional oxidants such as Ce4^ Mn04~, Cr2072\", Ru04 and Os04 [12]. In this paper, we report the electrochemistry of high-valent oxo com- plexes of [RuIII(H dmg)2(H20)2]+ 1 and the catalysis of the oxo inter- mediates in the electrocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexene and cyclooctene to the corresponding epoxides. * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 124 Experimental Materials Hydrated ruthenium chloride RuCls'xH^O was obtained from Johnson Matthey. Dimethylglyoxime (Hz dmg) was obtained from BDH Chemicals and used without further purification. Cis-cyclooctene was obtained from Fluka, U.S.A. and purified [13] before use to remove trace impurities. Cyclohexene was prepared from cyclohexanol by the known procedure [14]. All other chemicals, such as NaC104, HC104 and 1,4-dioxan were of A.R. grade. High purity nitrogen was further purified from traces of oxygen by passing through vanadous sulphate and alkaline pyrogallate solutions, and was used for deaeration of the solutions. Syntheses The complexes KIRu^H dmgUCIO^] and iqRu^H dmg);^] were synthesized by the published procedures [11]. The complex K2[RuCls(H20)] was synthesized from RuC^'xHaO as the starting material by a reported procedure [15]. Instrumentation Cyclic voltammograms were obtained with Princeton Applied Research instruments Model 174 A polarographic analyzer, Model 175 Universal pro- grammer and a three-electrode cell assembly Model 303 SMDE. The measure- ments were carried out with a BAS Model 2013 planar platinum inlay (0.012 cm2) working electrode, a platinum wire auxiliary electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. All cyclic voltammograms were recorded with a PAR RE 0089 X-Y recorder. Controlled potential coulometric electrolysis was carried out with a PAR Model 173 potentiostat and Model 179 current integrator. A coulometric cell of three-electrode configuration, consisting of a platinum gauge working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode separated from the main solution by a glass frit, and a SCE, was used. Product analysis was carried out on a Shimadzu gas chromatograph GC-9A, assembled with programmed and computerized Chromatopac CR-3A having a stainless steel column 2 m X 3.0 mm i.d. containing Carbowax on mesh Anakrom and using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The column temperature was maintained at 150 C with TCD temperature 200 C using hydrogen as the carrier gas. Cyclic voltammetric and differential pulse polarographic measurements Before taking cyclic voltammetric measurements, the platinum working electrode was treated with strong chromic acid for 15 min. It was then washed with distilled water, dried with a tissue paper and introduced into the cell containing 1:1 water-dioxan mixture. The pH was maintained in the range 1 - 4 with the help of HCIO^ and NaC104 buffers at p. = 0.1, while the pH between 4 - 7 was adjusted with phosphate buffer. After deaeration of the above solutions, the working electrode was activated cycling the 125 potentials three times at +0.0 V and 0.2 V for 30 s. The i-E plots for the supporting electrolytes in the required voltage range were recorded, the complex was then introduced into the cell and the i-E plots again recorded. Differential pulse polarograms (DPP) in all cases were recorded after holding the working electrode at positive potentials for 5 min and scanning cathodically. The DPP peak potentials were considered as Ei/^ in certain cases. Analytical measurements Quantitative coulometric oxidation of 1% cyclohexene or cyclooctene catalyzed by the electrochemical oxidation products of 1 at +0.75 V us. SCE were conducted in 1:1 water-dioxan at pH 2.5 (p. = 0.1 M (NaC104)). The anodic oxidation was continued for a period of 3 h and the oxidized olefins were extracted with 5 ml of ether and estimated by GLC. The products were then characterized by comparing their NMR with those of the expected oxidation products [16]. The olefins were oxidized exclusively to the epoxides. Results and discussion The conductivity data of the complex KCRu^H dmg);^^);] [11] in aqueous solution shows that it is a 1:2 electrolyte, indicating its immediate aquation in solution leading to the formation of the [Ru^H dmg^HaO)^]\"1\" 1 ion. The cationic complex 1 is considered as the precursor for the inter- mediate oxo complexes in the present investigation. v::::....,..:^ \\ 6H2/ Me , ...:QT.......H 8 H'- Figure 1 depicts the cyclic voltammogram and differential pulse polarogram for 1 at pH 1.1. The complex exhibits three redox couples at 1/2 values of +0.183 (I), +0.357 (II) and +0.522 V (III) us. Ag/AgCl. The peak to peak separation (AEp) of these couples are 70, 35 and 100 mV, respectively. Based on the coulometric data and the AEp values of the CV peaks, it is inferred that these peaks indicate three sequential redox steps involving one, two and one electrons, respectively. The Ei^ values of +0.183, +0.357 and +0.522 correspond to the redox couples, Ru(IV/III), 126 (K 0-0 E, V vs Ag/AgCl Fig. 1. DPP and cyclic voltammograms of 1 mM K(Ru(H dmg)2(CI04)2] in 1:1 water- dioxan of 0.1 M HC104 (pH 1.1), scan rate 20 mV s-1. Fig. 2. Pourbaix diagram for the K[Ru(H dmg);;(C104)2]. Ru(VI/IV) and Ru(VII/VI), respectively. The cathodic counterparts of anodic oxidation of these couples are not well resolved, apparently due to complications arising from the different extent of protonation of the inter- mediate species corresponding to these couples. The final redox step is a quasi-reversible one-electron Ru(III/II) couple obtained at 0,49 V in polarography. The 1/2 value of the three couples I - III are pH-dependent. The plot of pH vs. '1/3 of three couples are shown in the Pourbaix diagram (Fig. 2). Couple I is independent of pH above 5.0, but varies linearly with pH in the range 3.5 - 5.0 with a negative slope of 0.068 V/pH. This behaviour shows that couple I is a one-electron-one-proton coupled redox system, as shown in eqn. (1). [Ru^H-dn^^O^r > [Ru^H-dn^HzOHOW + e + H* (1) The break at pH 4.95 in the 1/2 vs. pH profile (Fig. 2.1) is an indirect measure of the pKa of 1. Couple I, however, shows unusual behaviour in the pH range 1.0 - 3.5 by exhibiting positive slope of the plot of 1/2 vs. pH at two distinctly different pH regions (1 - 2 and 2 - 3.5), with a small break at pH 1.9. This behaviour is expected, due to fast and stepwise protonation of the hydroxo groups in the two coordinated dimethylglyoximato groups preceding the electrochemical oxidations. The slopes of the pH vs. . '1/3 curves in the pH ranges 1 - 2 and 2 - 3.5 are 0.129 V/pH and 0.06 V/pH, respectively. The electrode reactions in these pH regions are given in eqns. (2) and (3), respectively: 127 pH2-3.5 [Ru^H-dmg^HzO^r + H+ ^ [Ru^Ha-dmg^Hp^]3+ + e (2) pHl -2.0 [Ru^H-dmg^HaO^r + 2H* > [Ru^^-dmg^^O)^ + e (3) The 1/2 vs. pH profile (Fig. 2.11) for couple II shows that it is indepen- dent of pH above 3.6. However, in the pH range 2 - 3.5, it exhibits linearity with pH, with a slope of 0.050 V (pH unit)\"1. The electro chemical reaction in this pH range, shown in eqn. (4), corresponds to the formation of an oxo or dihydrido species of Ru(IV). pH2-3.5 [Ru^H-dmgyHzO),]^ > [Ru^H-dn^OH^O)]2* + 2e + 2H+ (4) Between pH 1 - 2, couple II shows a positive slope of 0.118 V (pH unit)\"1, which supports the formation of a protonated Ru(VI) species in this pH range (eqn. (5)). tRuIV(H-dmg)2(H20)2]2++ 2H+ ^ [Ru^^-dmg^H^OMO)]^ + 2e + 2H4 (5) Couple III shows a linear dependence on pH in the range 2 - 3.5, with a slope of 0.09 (Fig. 2.III). Above pH 3.5, the couple is independent ofpH. Below pH 2, the couple shows a positive slope of 0.196 V (pH unit)\"1. The data thus supports the protonation of the Ru(VII) complex as shown in reactions (6) and (7). pH2-3.5 [Ru^H-dmgyOH),]2+ > [Ru^tH-dmgyO^F + e + 2IT (6) pHl-2 [Ru^H-dmgyH^OMO)]^ + H* > [Ru^^-dmgaMOHMO)]-\"- + e (7) Electrocatalytic oxidations ofolefins Figure 3 shows the difference in cyclic voltammograms of 1 recorded in the presence and absence of 1% cyclooctene at pH 1.5. The anodic peak currents of couples I, II and III are considerably enhanced, indicating an interaction of the olefins with the high-valent metal-oxo complexes that are formed at the electrode surface to yield the epoxide. A similar behaviour was observed with cyclohexene. However, inhibitory effects due to olefin are seen above 1% olefin concentrations. Controlled potential electrolysis experi- ments at pH 2.5 and potentials +0.75 us. SCE provide the maximum yield of the product (34 - 38%), The GLC analysis of the product after extraction by ether indicates clean oxidation of the cyclooctene and cyclohexene to their epoxides in 34% and 38% yields, respectively. These reactions were catalytic with a turnover rate of 5.9 and 4.1 mol epoxide (mol catalyst)\"1 (h)~1 128 0-8 (U 0-0 E, V vs Ag/AgCI Fig. 3.

The yields at other pH and potentials were low, indicating the predominant catalytic reaction of the dioxo species over other high-valent species in solution. References 1 J. T. Groves, T. E.
