Keywords: Layered double hydroxide Bimetallic Solid base Glycerol Hydrogenolysis Propanediol Â 1. Introduction Heterogeneous catalysts containing more than one metal are widely employed in the chemistry industry. Usually, these kinds of catalysts are prepared by coprecipitation, impregnaâ€� tion, solâ€�gel, or ionâ€�exchange methods on different supports [1]. However, these methods usually resulted in some inhomogeâ€� neous agglomeration of the active metals and thus affect the efficiency of the catalysts. Achieving a homogeneous dispersion of the functionalized metals would of great interest in the caâ€� talysis community, especially if those catalysts contained two or more active metals. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have received considâ€� erable attention due to their unique structure and their appliâ€� cation as catalysts and catalyst precursors in recent years [2â€“4]. The properties of the LDHs can be easily tailored by seâ€� lecting the appropriate metals with the desired properties, and homogeneously dispersed mixed oxides with acidicâ€�basic and redox properties can be synthesized via the controlled calcinaâ€� tion and reduction of LDH precursors. In particular, the prepaâ€� ration of homogeneously dispersed metal catalysts, with two and more active metals from LDH precursors has been widely reported [5â€“10]. Recently, with the rapid growth of the biodiesel industry, glycerol has become widely produced as it is a major byâ€�product (10% by weight). This large surplus of glycerol is widely regarded as a waste [8,11]. It is therefore important to find new ways of converting this glycerol into valueâ€�added products, such as the catalytic oxidation of glycerol to glyceric acid and dihydroxyacetone [12â€“17], dehydration of glycerol to acrolein [18â€“21], and hydrogenolysis of glycerol to propanediâ€� ols [11,22â€“34]. Amongst them, the selective dehydroxylation of * Corresponding author.

Catal., Vol. 34, No. 5, May 2013 XIA Shuixin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 986â€“992 glycerol to 1,2â€�propanediol (1,2â€�PDO) is a promising route. Many catalysts have been reported for the hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2â€�PDO. One group is based on noble metal cataâ€� lysts, such as Ru [22â€“25], Pt [26,27], Re [23,28,29], and Ag [30]. Cu [31â€“36], Ni [37,38] and Co [37] have also been shown to be active in the hydrogenolysis of glycerol. The activities of these metals are generally lower than the noble metals, but lower prices and higher resistance to poisoning by trace impurities make them more competitive. Among these nonâ€�noble metals, Cu is superior to Ni and Co in terms of the selectivity for PDOs due to its lower activity for Câ€“C bond cleavage. In our previous work, we have successfully prepared Cu/solidâ€�base catalysts via LDH precursors and found that the activity of the Cu/solidâ€�base increased with the dispersion of Cu and the base strength of the support [3], and the selectivity could be improved by the addition of a small amount of Pd [39]. Bimetallic Pdâ€“Fe, Pdâ€“Ni, Pdâ€“Co, and Pdâ€“Zn have been recently shown to be active for this reaction [40]. These results directed us to use a small amount of noble metal in a Cu/solidâ€�base to improve the catalyst. Herein, we report the efficient synthesis for a Ruâ€� or Reâ€�doped Cu/solid base catalyst with highly disperse copper and Ru or Re through the thermal decomposition of M0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98(OH)16CO3 (M = Ru, Re) LDHs compounds, and their application in the hydrogenolysis of glycerol. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Trivalent metal ions (Ru 3+ , Re 3+ ) in M0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98â€� (OH)16CO3 (M = Ru, Re) LDH precursors with M:Cu:Mg:Al molar ratios of 0.02:0.4:5.6:1.98 were prepared by coprecipitation. The calculated amounts of MCl3, Cu(NO3)2Â·3H2O, Al(NO3)3Â· 9H2O, and Mg(NO3)2Â·6H2O (AR, Shanghai Chemicals, China) were dissolved together in 400 ml of deionized water to make solution A. Solution B comprised a mixture of 0.25 mol/L Na2CO3 and 0.8 mol/L NaOH (AR, Shanghai Chemicals, China). Solution A and B were simultaneously added to a glass reactor with vigorous stirring at room temperature and at a pH of 9.5. The slurry was aged at 120 Â°C for 20 h, filtered, and washed thoroughly with distilled water until free of Cl ï€­ . The precipitate was then dried at 80 Â°C overnight and identified as M0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98(OH)16CO3. The LDH precursors were then calcined at 300 Â°C in stationary air for 4 h, before being identiâ€� fied by Xâ€�ray diffraction (XRD) as M0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98O9. Furâ€� ther reduction with H2 at 300 Â°C for 1 h yielded the bimetallic Mâ€�Cu/solid base catalysts. 2.2. Characterizations XRD patterns of the synthesized M0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98â€� (OH)16CO3 LDH precursors and its decomposition product, the mixed oxides M0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98O9, were detected at room temperature on a Rigaku D/WAXâ€�2500 diffractometer using Cu KÎ± radiation (Î» = 0.15406 nm) with a 2Î¸ step of 0.02Â°. The pore structure and surface area of the decomposed mixed oxides M0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98O9 were measured by N2 adâ€� sorption at its normal boiling point using Micromeritics ASAP 2010 analyzer after being pretreated at 250 Â°C for 4 h in vacâ€� uum. The BET surface area and BJH pore size distribution were calculated using their desorption isotherms. The outline and fine structure of the fresh M0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6â€� Al1.98(OH)16CO3 precursors were detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on a microscope (Leo Series VP 1430, Gerâ€� many) with a silicon detector equipped with an enerâ€� gyâ€�dispersive Xâ€�ray (EDX) facility (Oxford instruments). Samâ€� ples were coated with gold using sputter coating to avoid charging. Analysis was carried out at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the hydrogen reduced Ruâ€� or Reâ€�doped Cu/solid base catalysts were obtained using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV (TEM, JEOLâ€�2010F). The reducibility of the decomposed mixed oxides M0.02Cu0.4â€� Mg5.6Al1.98O9 was performed via temperatureâ€�programmed reduction (H2â€�TPR). These characterizations were carried out in a quartz reactor. Samples were first pretreated at 400 Â°C for 1 h under N2 at a flow rate of 30 ml/min and cooled to room temperature. A reduction agent (10% H2â€�90% N2 mixture, 30 ml/min) was shifted and the reactor was heated to 450 Â°C at a rate of 10 Â°C/min. The effluent gas was dried by powdered KOH and the consumption of hydrogen were recorded by thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Calibration of the instrument was carried out with a known amount of CuO. The H2 activation activity of the reduced catalysts was carâ€� ried out via temperatureâ€�programmed desorption of H2 (H2â€�TPD). The sample was first reduced at 300 Â°C in a H2 flow of 30 ml/min for 1 h, purged with purified Ar and further treated at 450 Â°C for 0.5 h in Ar. The reactor was then cooled to 50 Â°C in Ar, exposed to 10% H2â€�90% Ar for 30 min, purged with Ar for 5 h at 50 Â°C in order to eliminate the physical adsorbed H2. Temâ€� peratureâ€�programmed desorption was conducted by ramping to 450 Â°C at 10 Â°C/min and H2 (m/e = 2) in the effluent was detected and recorded as a function of temperature by a quadâ€� rupole mass spectrometer (OmniStarTM, GSD301, Switzerâ€� land). 2.3. Catalytic reactions Hydrogenolysis of glycerol was performed in a cusâ€� tomâ€�designed 100 ml stainless steel autoclave equipped with a Teflon inner layer. Before the reaction, the catalyst was preâ€� treated in a stream of H2 at 300 Â°C for 1 h. The reaction mixture included an 8.0 g solution of glycerol (75 wt%) in different solâ€� vents and a controlled amount of catalyst. Then the autoclave was charged with H2 to 2.0 MPa and placed in an oil bath preâ€� heated to required temperature with vigorous stirring (MAGâ€�NEO, RVâ€�06 M, Japan). After the reaction, the reactor was cooled to room temperature. The vapor phase was collected and analyzed, the liquid phase was centrifuged to remove the solid catalyst powder and analyzed using an FID gas chroâ€� matograph (Shimadzu, 14 B) equipped with a 30 m capillary column (DBâ€�WAX 52 CB, USA). All products detected in the liquid phase were verified by a GCâ€�MS system (Agilent 6890) XIA Shuixin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 986â€“992 and quantified via external calibration method. The selectivity for product was calculated on carbon basis. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Chemical and physical properties Figure 1 shows the XRD paterns of the fresh M0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98(OH)16CO3 precursors. Sharp and symmetâ€� rical reflections lines assign as diffraction from the (003), (006), (012), (015), (110), and (113) planes were observed, which reflected the characteristic structure of LDHs. The intenâ€� sity of the (003) reflection decreased with the addition of M, which means that the orderliness of layered double hydroxide crystallite declined. The well developed layered structure of the solid lamella in the M0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98(OH)16CO3 precursors were also directly identified in their SEM images. Figure 2 shows the SEM images of the as synthesized Cu0.4Mg5.6Al2(OH)16CO3 and M0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98(OH)16CO3 precursors. The LDH precursors appeared to be ball/flower particles sized from 1.8â€“2.0 Î¼m in diameter (shown in the insert images in Fig. 2). Under higher resolution, well developed layered structures of the solid laâ€� mella could be identified in each particle. The average thickness of a solid lamella was about 20 nm in Cu0.4Mg5.6Al2(OH)16CO3 (Fig. 2(a)). This thickness decreased to 15â€“16 nm in both M0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98(OH)16CO3 samples (see Fig. 2). This deâ€� crease in thickness of the solid lamella could be attributed to that the decrease in orderliness in the LDH crystallite caused by the addition of the noble metals, and these results fit well with the XRD analysis (see Fig. 1). Interâ€�particle spaces and slit pores were detected in all the samples, which could be ascribed to the accumulation of these layered solid lamellae. These can be regarded as the source of the mesopores. These mesopores are a great enhancement as they enhance the accessibility of reactants to the active sites and improve the diffusion of prodâ€� ucts. After calcination at 300 Â°C for 4 h, the characteristic diffracâ€� tion peaks of lamellar structure still could be detected, which means that the gallery structure of hydrotalcite remained, however, the intensity and the sharpness of the peaks deâ€� creased, which indicates that the orderliness of solid lamellar decreased during thermal decomposition owing to partial loss of carbonate and water in the gallery of the hydrotalcite during the calcinations. No separated peaks from the oxides of Cu, Ru, or Re were detected, which means the amount of these metals was sufficiently low and remained highly dispersed in the solid lamellae (see Fig. 3). Figure 4 shows TEM images of the crossâ€�sections of the hyâ€� drogen reduced Ruâ€� or Reâ€�doped Cu/solid base catalysts, in which the gallery structure of hydrotalcite can be seen, which agrees with the XRD analysis (see Fig. 3). The solid lamellae in these reduced catalysts, with thicknesses of about 16â€“17 nm and being 450â€“480 nm in length, can be seen, agreeing with 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 2ï�±/( o ) I n t e n s i t y (003) (006) (012) (015) (018) (110) (113) (1) (2) (3) Fig. 1.

These lamellae are arranged in parallel with a gap of about 70â€“80 nm. High resolution TEM images of the solid lamellae disclosed that the d spacing of the reduced sample is around 0.8 nm, which fits well with the calculated structure of LDH [42]. No separate Cu particles can be identiâ€� fied, which confirms the Cu and Ru or Re to be dispersed hoâ€� mogenously in the matrix of the hydrotalcite. The nitrogen adsorptionâ€�desorption isotherms of the calâ€� cined Cu0.4Mg5.6Al2O9 and M0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98O9 are shown in Fig. 5. All of the isotherms are type IV according to the IUPAC classification. All the samples therefore have mesoporous structures, which is in accordance with their SEM and TEM images (Fig. 4). And these mesopores should enhance the acâ€� cessibility of reactants to the active sites and improve the outâ€� ward diffusion of products. The closure point of hysteresis loop of Cu0.4Mg5.6Al2O9 is located at a relative pressure of 0.6. Howâ€� ever, the hysteresis loop of Ru0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98O9 closed at 0.5, which suggests that the pore diameter has decreased. Re0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98O9 has a closure point of hysteresis loop at about 0.6, inferring a similar pore diameter to Cu0.4Mg5.6Al2O9 (see Table 1). The calculated BET surface area of Cu0.4Mg5.6Al2O9 is 204.6 m 2 /g. A slight increase was observed in Ru0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98O9, and a slight decrease in BET surface area in Re0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98O9 (see Table 1). Figure 6 illustrates the H2â€�TPR profiles of the calcined Cu0.4Mg5.6Al2O9 and M0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98O9. Only one broader peak from 250 to 340 Â°C was detected in Cu0.4Mg5.6Al2O9. This hydrogen consumption could be designated to the reduction of Cu 2+ ions in lamellar structure of Cu0.4Mg5.6Al2O9 [3]. This same reduction peak of copper drops to 210â€“305 Â°C in Ru0.02Cu0.4â€� Mg5.6Al1.98O9 and to 230â€“310 Â°C for Re0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98O9. These results mean that the reducibility of Cu 2+ ions in lamellar structure of M0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98O9 was improved by the addiâ€� tion of the noble metals. This improvement could be ascribed to superior dissociation of H2 on noble metals before moving to the Cu 2+ ions [39,43â€“44]. That is, the addition of Ru or Re in M0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98O9 improves the concentration of active hydrogen available for use in the reduction of Cu 2+ ions. At the same time, no peaks relating to the reduction of the M 3+ ions were observed, which was most likely due to the small amount of the noble metal present. The hydrogen activation and the spillover ability of the M0.02Cu0.4/Mg5.6Al1.98O8.57 catalysts were tested by H2â€�TPD and shown in Fig. 7. It can be found that no desorption peak was observed over the whole temperature range for Cu0.4/Mg5.6Al2O8.6. However, three obvious H2 desorption peaks (at 90â€“140, 240â€“300, and 300â€“360 Â°C) were detected in both (a) (b) Fig. 4. TEM images of the reduced samples.

These results indicated that the addiâ€� tion of Ru or Re significantly enhanced the ability to adsorbing hydrogen. According to the published works in this area, the resolved peak at low temperature (90â€“140 Â°C) could be asâ€� cribed to the decomposition of MH x or hydrogen adsorbed on M. While a much broader signal in the range of 240â€“300 Â°C monitors the desorption of hydrogen from the Cu particles, and the shoulder peak at 300â€“360 Â°C would arise from splitting Hâ€“H on the surface of the Mgâ€�Alâ€�O oxides [45â€“48]. These reâ€� sults suggested that hydrogen activation and spillover pheâ€� nomena driven by the added Ru or Re markedly influence the adsorption of H2. The addition of Ru or Re enhanced both the hydrogen storage capacity and H2 activation ability over the surface of the catalysts. These enhanced H2 activation abilities would improve its activity for glycerol hydrogenolysis. 3.2. Glycerol hydrogenolysis Table 2 summarized the activity of the hydrogen reduced Ruâ€� or Reâ€�doped Cu/solid base catalysts which were prepared from the M0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6Al1.98(OH)16CO3 (M = Ru, Re) LDH preâ€� cursors for glycerol hydrogenolysis. On the surface of the Cu0.4/Mg5.6Al2O8.6 catalyst, the conversion of glycerol and the selectivity for 1,2â€�PDO in aqueous solution were 56.7% and 97.1%, respectively, at low hydrogen pressure (2.0 MPa) and short time (10 h). With the addition of M, a remarkable inâ€� crease in the conversion of glycerol could be observed. The conversion of glycerol over Ru0.02Cu0.4/Mg5.6Al1.98O8.57 and Re0.02Cu0.4/Mg5.6Al1.98O8.57 were 70.6% and 71.6%, respectively. In order to investigate the reason for this improved activity, M0.02/Mg5.6Al1.98O8.57 were also prepared and tested in the glycerol hydrogenolysis reaction. However, almost no converâ€� sion of glycerol was observed. All the results indicated that the enhanced activity of M0.02Cu0.4/Mg5.6Al1.98O8.57 was not due to additional M sites, but to a synergetic effect of M on the active Cu sites, which enhanced the hydrogen activation ability over just M [39,43,44]. Glycerol hydrogenolysis in different solvents was also perâ€� formed. The use of alcohols clearly favored the conversion of glycerol. This can be attributed to the stronger adsorption of water onto the catalyst than methanol, ethanol, and C3H7OH, which hinders the accessibility of glycerol [49]. Table 3 shows the activity of recycled M0.02Cu0.4/ Mg5.6Al1.98O8.57 catalyst in ethanol solution. The detected conâ€� version of glycerol over Ru0.02Cu0.4/Mg5.6Al1.98O8.57 decreased from 90.2% (the fresh catalyst) to 86.3% (for the second cycle) and similar phenomena could be detected in the following reâ€� cycles. The decrease of the glycerol conversion could be atâ€� tributed to the loss of catalyst associated with separation and transfer of the catalyst in recycling process. Overall, the amount of catalyst decreased from 1.0 g to 0.65 g in the fifth cycle. The trend of glycerol hydrogenolysis on Re0.02Cu0.4/Mg5.6Al1.98O8.57 is similar to that of Ru0.02Cu0.4/Mg5.6Al1.98O8.57. All the results indicated M0.02Cu0.4/Mg5.6Al1.98O8.5 was stable for the consecuâ€� tive reactions. 4. Conclusions Ruâ€� or Reâ€�doped Cu/solid base catalysts have been successâ€� fully synthesized via calcination of the M0.02Cu0.4Mg5.6â€� Al1.98(OH)16CO3 (M = Ru or Re) precursors prepared by coâ€� precipitation. These catalysts exhibited excellent performance for the hydrogenolysis of glycerol under mild conditions.

Bimetallic M-Cu/solid base catalysts with high metal dispersion were obtained after calcination and H2 reduction of these LDH precursors. These catalysts exhibited excellent performances for the hydrogenolysis of biomass-derived glycerol under mild conditions. The catalysts were stable when recycled five times. Characterizations indicated that the addition of Ru or Re enhanced the adsorption and activation of hydrogen on the surface of catalysts, which contributed to the high conversion of glycerol.",
