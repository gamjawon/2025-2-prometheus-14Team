Alyea*, Kevin F. Brown and Keith J. Fisher Gwlph-Waterloo Centre for Graduate Work in Chemistry, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Guelph, Gwlph, Ont. NIG 2W1 (Canada) (Received March 26, 1990; accepted July 17, 1990) Metal vapour synthesis (MVS), long established as a methodology for novel organometallic species [1 3], has been shown to have enormous potential for the preparation of new materials and catalytic systems [4, 5]. Relatively stable zero-valent metal atom slurries can be highly dispersed onto solid or polymer supports and into zeolite frameworks in a one-step procedure [4]; nickel on oxide supports, for example, forms excellent catalysts for hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis and methanation [6]. In contrast, few cocon- densations of metal oxides using MVS methodology have been explored [1, 4], rare examples being MoOs and WOs with some solvents as ligands [7, 8]. Although thermal and photodecomposition of the partially characterized product resulting from the cocondensation ofMo03 with methanol, formulated as MogOgCOCl^a 2CH30H (I), mimicked the heterogeneously catalyzed partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde, no attempts to test (I) as a catalyst were reported [7 10]. We now communicate that (I), generated by the MVS methodology**, whether unsupported or deposited on y-alumina, is aprecursor to catalysts which have catalytic activity for the partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde higher than that of traditional catalysts. Furthermore, our cocondensation procedure allows any volatile metal oxide or a combination of metal oxides to be uniformly dispersed on any solid support. The procedure has wide applicability for the design of heterogeneous metal oxide catalysts. Evaporation of MoOa (m.p. 795 C) by resistive heating and coconden- sation with methanol at 196 C leads, upon warming to room temperature, to the formation of (I) [7, 8], which has also been prepared by refluxing Mo03'2H20 in methanol [9, 10]. By employing a 200 or more molar excess of methanol (e.g. 0.5 g MoOa and 50 ml methanol), a clear colourless solution Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. *The Torrovap apparatus obtained from Torrovap Industries Inc., 90 Nolan Court, Unit 39-40, Markham, Ont., Canada, L3R 4H9 has been described by Ozin [4]. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands L12 is obtained upon warming. The presence of MoOs 3MeOH in this solution is suggested by the + 66 ppm resonance observed by ^Mo NMR spectroscopy [11]. Precipitation of (I) occurs only after ca. 12 h, so supported materials were obtained by introducing carrier supports (e.g. SiOz, '/-alumina, H-ZSM- 5) to the solution. Similarily, supported materials have been obtained by the evaporation ofVgO^ (m.p. 690 C) andWOs (m.p. 1473 C) and cocondensation with methanol. Since we have also observed the ready volatility of other oxides in the Torrovap apparatus (e.g. NbaOg, BigOs, Fe203, FeaCMoC^a etc.), the MVS methodology has wide applicability to the fabrication of heterogeneous metal oxide catalysts. While the development of both single and mixed oxide systems is underway, this preliminary communication focuses on the new materials made from MoOs. Our IR, Raman, \"C solid state NMR andXRD examinations of unsupported (I) verify the presence of bridging methoxy groups, as proposed by DeKock and McAfee [8], rather than terminal ones, as suggested by McCarron and Sleight [10]. Furthermore, X-ray data has confirmed the existence of two methoxy bridge groups in a product obtained during the catalytic epoxidation of cyclohexene in toluene using (I) [12]. In testing (I) alone and (I) on various supports for the partial oxidation of methanol, following thermal activation at 500-525 C, we observed reaction product distributions of dimethyl ether, formaldehyde and water that were similar to those observed for the thermal decomposition of (I). Subsequently, we focused on preactivation by photochemical methods to increase the selectivity to formaldehyde. The key to obtaining the high selectivity witnessed during the photo- catalytic decomposition of (I) [8] was to first photoactivate the heterogeneous catalysts by exposure to UV light (<350 nm) for 24 h or by exposure to fluorescent lighting for ~4 months. This photoactivation was followed by a subsequent heating of the sample to 280 C (the temperature was determined by thermal desorption studies to remove any remaining water present in the catalyst). This activation step yielded a light blue catalyst of significantly improved selectivity. SEM (micrographs shown in Fig. 1) and BET analyses showed the unsupported photoactivated catalyst to be composed of particles with a diameter of between 15-50 nm (estimated from a 200K magnification of the image in Fig. 1), a surface area of ~25 m2 g~1 and pore radii ranging from 10 to 62 angstroms. XRD results produced a pattern similar to MoOa with extensive line broadening (due to the small particle size and high degree of non-crystallinity). The commercial MoOg sample (Aesar 99.95%) used for comparison was found to typically possess particle sizes from 1 15 /mi with a surface area of ~ 1 2 m2 g~1. Catalytic testing for all samples was performed with identical catalyst weights and methanol/air feeds. The exception was MoOa, which was run at half the methanol molar feed of the other catalysts due to its low activity. Figure 2 shows the percent conversion curves for the MoOs, Fe2(MoC>4)3/ MoOg, unsupported and y-alumina supported photoactivated catalysts. The graph shows that the MVS-produced photoactivated catalysts obtain 100% L13 (a) X70.0 K 430 nm (b) X200 K 15.0 ^m Fig. 1.

Selectivities witnessed during the testing were remarkably similar but in the order FeaCMoO^s/MoOa (95%) < unsupported and -/-alumina-supported photoactivated catalysts (96%)<MoC>3 (98%). Combustion products produced by the photoactivated catalysts were significantly lower than those produced by Fea(Mo04)3/Mo03 and other -/-alumina-supported standard MoC>3 catalysts. Whether this result and the high efficiency are related to the presence of dual dioxo-molybdenum sites [13], as well as the ~ 150 C lower temperature of conversion for the MVS-produced photoactivated catalysts, is under investigation. L14 Future papers will detail the characterization of (I) and the unsupported and supported catalysts as well as the high activity of these and other metal oxide systems for other organic transformations.
