Introduction X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) combined with angle dependent (AR) and depth profiling measurements is a powerful tool for surface characterization of heterogeneous catalytic systems. However, XPS spectra of insulating materials, e.g. W03/SiOZ, suffer from signal distortion and broadening with loss of resolution due to inhomogeneous sample charging. This prevents a straightforward analysis of the signal envelopes whereby much of the hidden information is not available for interpretation. Several authors [ 1,2] have found that detrimental charging can be avoided by using a model support consisting of a silicon or aluminium crystal covered by an oxide layer typically a few nanometers thick. The active phase is usually deposited onto the support by evaporation, or by the decomposition of suitable metal carbonyls [2]. *Corresponding author; fax.

Verpoort et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 43-52 In this study we use Si02 /Si (100) model supports [3] for the preparation of a WO3/ Si02 / S'( 100) precursor by way of incipient wetness impregnation from an aqueous solution of ammonium tungstate. Heating in air at 600 C forms the desired tungsten oxide. The conducting model support offers attractive advantages over the porous powder sample. Inhomogeneous sample charging is avoided producing spectra of much better resolution and reliable peak shape. Furthermore, angle-resolved XPS becomes meaningful since the direction perpendicular to the surface is defined. In this paper we report on the characterization of the W03/S'02 precursor by general, AR- and depth profiling XPS. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation A 9 wt.% W03/Si02 precursor has been prepared by pore volume impregnation of 3 grams of silica (Polypor surface area 345 m2/g) with 25 ml ammonium tungstate (Aldrich) solution (0.6 g (NHQ)ZW04 in 25 ml HZO and heating until the (NHQ)zW04 is dissolved [4] ). After the impregnation the sample is dried at 100 C and subsequently calcined in air at 600 C. The model support, a Si(100) single crystal (10 X 10 X 1 mm), was oxidized at 500 C in air for 11 h. The Si02/Si(100) surface is impregnated by a drop of an aqueous solution of ammonium tungstate (0.0376 g/1). Drying the sample in an evacuated desiccator followed by calcination at 600 C, results in a heavy loading of the edges while the center, which was the region chosen for study, shows a uniform distribution. 2.2. Spectroscopic techniques XPS spectra were obtained with a Perkin Elmer PHI 5500 ESCA spectrometer equipped with a monochromatized A1 Ka source, a hemispherical analyzer connected to a multichannel detector and a manipulator which enables the variation of the take-off angle of the photoelectrons between 0 and 90 . XPS spectra of the model support and the model precursor were measured with 11.75 eV pass energy and those of the powder precursor, immobilised on an adhesive tape, at 48.50 eV pass energy. Charge correction for the powder samples is related to the C 1 s peak at 284.6 eV. The spectra were accumulated, smoothed, and integrated using the PHI-ACCESS program. Constraints suited to impose the spin doublet character of the line pairs, e.g., ratios of linewidths and intensities, binding energy splitting, had to be implemented by the user. XPS depth profiling was performed in the same apparatus. The surface was bombarded with 4 keV Ar+ ions and the argon beam was rastered over an area of 3 X 3 mm around the point of impact of the ion beam. F. Verpoort et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 43-52 45 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Characterization of the Si02 /Si(100) model support The Si 2p XPS spectrum of the model support is shown in Fig. 1. The experimental data are given in Table 1. Two peaks are clearly observed, one at 102.80 eV, originating from Si02 [ 5 ] , and one at 98.81 eV due to the silicon substrate. Both peaks are actually unresolved 2P3,z 2p 2 doublets. The known energy separation (eV) and intensity ratio between the Si 2P3,2 and the Si 2p, /2 are introduced in the curve fitting program producing the binding energy data in Table 1. Niemantsverdriet et al. [ 6] proved that the thin layer of Si02 on Si(100) is an acceptable model for high surface area Si02 if the model support is oxidized at elevated temperatures. Fig. 2 shows the Si4+/Si intensity as a function of the take-off angle, relative to the surface normal, (full line) for the angle-resolved XPS spectra of the Si02/S' (100) model support after oxidation for 11 h at 500 C in air. 10 9. z W 8. 6 :-v ; 5 4 105 104 103 102 101 100 99 98 Binding Energy (eV) Fig. 1.

[7 ] , B the take-off angle with respect to the surface normal and d the thickness of the Si02 layer. Recalculation with d = 3.3 nn produces a curve which agrees very well with the measured values. We can conclude that, in our experiment, the surface of the S'OZ/Si(100) model support is covered by a 3.3 nm Si02 layer following oxidation in air at 500 C for 11 h. 3.2. W03 IS'02 powder precursor In Fig. 3a,b the XPS spectra of the O Is and W 4f region of the W03/Si02 precursor are visualized. The XPS data are summarized in Table 2. The broad peaks in the spectra of the powder precursor exhibiting a charge shift of 5.10 eV have been charge corrected by using the C is peak at 284.6 eV as an internal reference [ 8 ] . The two components of the W 4f doublet are not resolved due to inhomogeneous charge broadening (Fig. 3c), which results in line widths of the order of 4.00 eV. If the W 4f signal is fitted with a doublet using fixed 4f5/Z : 4f.,/2 intensity ratio of 0.78 ( 0.03) and an Eb splitting of 2.1 ( 0.1) eV [9], a W 4f,/Z binding energy of 36.66 eV is obtained, which is in agreement with the presence of WO3 [ 10] . 3.3. W03/Si02/Si (100) model precursor The spectra of the model precursor obtained using the same instrument settings, show a much better resolution (Fig. 3c,d). The XPS spectrum of O is electrons (Fig. 3b) characterized by a weak asymmetry indicating multiple band structure, has a maximum at 532.88 eV. This is in agreement with the O is electron binding energy for Si02 [ 11-14] since the oxygen atoms in the silica matrix produce the basic contribution to the spectrum. The O 1 s band was resolved and a satisfactory approximation of the signal envelope is obtained on superposition of a minimum of three bands: at 532.88 eV, having the maximum intensity (87.22% contribution), at 531.27 eV (5.79% contribution), and at 534.00 eV (6.99% contribution). The peak at 531.27 eV coincides with the O 1 s electron peak for free W03 [ 11 ] . This band is assigned to W03 present on the surface of Si02 in the form of microcrystallites [ 15 ] . The nature of this peak can be confirmed by angle-resolved XPS. Large take-off angles ( > 60 ) favor the detection of real surface particles while at angles greater than 45 , the surface composition is obscured by the increasing importance of the in depth analysis of the matrix (Fig. 4). The 534.00 eV maximum, at higher binding energies, can be assigned to O is oxygen electrons of adsorbed water [ 16] . 48 F. Verpoort et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 43-52 The tungsten 4f doublet is readily resolved into its 7 / 2 and 5 / 2 components. The linewidth of the W 4f of the model support is 1.54 eV compared to 4.00 eV in the spectrum of the powder precursor. Applying the Scofield W 4f5,Z : W 4f7/2 intensity ratio of 0.78, Eb splitting of 2.1 eV and Eb=35.4 eV for W03 as constraints, curve fitting resolves the W signal envelope of the W03/Si02/Si (100) model support into two doublets (Fig. 3d). The low intensity doublet (Eb W 4f,,Z=36.79 eV) is shifted to higher binding energies in compar ison to W03 and W04 2- [171. This band is tentatively assigned to the tungsten oxide linked by a chemical bond to the Si02 matrix. 10 _w s 5 1 3 2 10 3 2 1 0 Powder precursor 536 535 M odel precursor (a) 534 533 532 531 530 529 Binding Energy (eV) 536 535 534 533 532 531 530 529 Binding Energy (eV) F.

XPS depth profiling By XPS depth profiling the relative concentration of the surface elements as a function of depth can be measured. In Fig. 5 the depth profile is shown for the W03/Si02/Si (100) model precursor. The simultaneous removal of W and O is consistent with the presence of poorly dispersed W03 particles which leave a considerable fraction of the support uncovered. The precursor shows no features characteristic for layered structures. 50 F.

Angle-resolved XPS The indications obtained from XPS depth profiles can be verified by take-off angle dependent XPS measurements. If a system has a layered structure, its XPS intensity should increase with respect to that of the substrate when the spectrum is recorded at grazing angles. Furthermore for a poorly dispersed phase the angle dependence will be less pronounced. F.

Fig. 6 clearly shows that the W 4f/Si4+ XPS intensity ratio for the precursor prepared by impregnation hardly depends on the take-off angle. This confirms the supposed low dispersion of the impregnation precursor. 4. Conclusion A flat, conducting model support consisting of a few nanometers of Si02 on a Si (100) substrate, offers interesting possibilities for the application of XPS, and other surface techniques hampered by charging effects, for instance SIMS, AES, to study aspects of the surface chemistry involved in catalyst preparation. Electrical charging is almost completely avoided resulting in a spectacular improvement in spectral resolution. In addition the geometry of the support makes the application of angle-dependent XPS and sputter depth profiles meaningful. The results suggest the simultaneous presence of at least two types of tungsten oxide structures, microcrystallites of W03 and a small tungsten oxide monolayer on the surface of the W03/Si02/Si (100) precursor.

        "dc:description": "Model supports consisting of a thin layer of SiO2 on a silicon single crystal have been used to study the WO3/SiO2/Si (100) catalyst precursor. Compared to the powder analogues, a drastic increase in spectral resolution and detailed band structure is observed in the XPS spectra. Conventional XPS, angle dependent and depth profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy show the presence of two types of tungsten oxide on the surface: microcrystallites of WO3 and a tungsten oxide monolayer chemically bonded to the silica matrix.",
