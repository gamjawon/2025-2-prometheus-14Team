Hillerov~, Z. Vft, M. Zdra~il* Institute of Chemical Process Fundamentals, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, 165 02 Prague 6 - Suchdol, Czech Republic Received 30 September 1993; accepted version received 7 July 1994 Abstract Magnesia supported Ni-Mo sulfide catalysts were prepared by three methods: by impregnation from aqueous solutions, by precipitation-adsorption of sulfides in a water-toluene emulsion, and by impregnation from non-aqueous solutions using dimethylsulfoxide and methanol as solvents. They were tested in: (i) the single hydrodesulfurization of thiophene (HDS), and (ii) the parallel hydro- desulfurization of thiophene (HDS,PY) and the hydrodenitrogenation of pyridine (HDN). The reference Ni-Mo/alumina catalyst was the commercial sample Shell 324. The catalytic activity of samples prepared by aqueous impregnation and by precipitation-adsorption was low, activity for (HDS) and (HDN) of the best sample being only about 30 and 20%, respectively, of the activity of the Shell 324 catalyst at 320. The chemical and textural instability of the high surface area magnesia in aqueous solutions was the limiting factor. Much higher activity was achieved by non-aqueous impregnation, activity of the best Ni-Mo/MgO sample prepared by this method for (HI)S), (HDS,PY) and (HDN) being 94, 290 and 105%, respectively, of the activity of the Shell 324 catalyst at 320. As compared with the alumina supported catalyst, the special feature of the Ni-Mo/MgO catalysts irrespective of the preparation method was lower inhibition of HDS by parallel HDN and lower selectivity to HDN in parallel HDN and HDS.

Hillerovd et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) 111-125 support is the important variable for modifying and improving their properties. The majority of previous results concern acidic or neutral supports such as carbon, silica, titania, zeolites, etc. (for review see [ 1,2 ] ). On the other hand, basic supports have been studied much less. Magnesia is a typical basic support and the data on Mo/MgO, Ni-Mo/MgO and Co-Mo/MgO sulfide catalysts are scarce. Such catalysts were claimed to be selec- tive for hydrodesulfurization (HDS), with minimum hydrogenation of alkenes [3], to have low propensity to coking and metallation [4], and to have very low hydrocracking activity [ 5 ]. Magnesia supported sulfide catalysts are generally held as less active than their alumina supported counterparts. The few available previous data concern mostly HDS, hydrogenation and hydrocracking [ 5,6 ], some results are available for hydro- denitrogenation (HDN) [ 6 ]. The conventional preparation method for Ni-Mo sulfide catalysts is the impreg- nation of a cartier by aqueous solutions of ammonium heptamolybdate and nickel nitrate. This procedure has also been applied in the previous papers on magnesia supported catalysts [ 5,6]. However, aqueous impregnation is a very questionable method in this case and might be the reason for the low activity. Magnesia is unique among the carriers since it reacts easily with water [ 7-11 ]. High surface area MgO (100-300 m2 g-~) is transformed to low surface area Mg (OH) 2 ( 10-30 m2 g - 1 ) during aqueous impregnation and drying. A part of the active phase might be trapped in the solid during the collapse of the texture of the starting support. Reverse chemical and textural changes occur during calcination; low surface area Mg(OH)2 can again be transformed to high surface area MgO. However, some ions in the impregnation solutions have a negative effect on the surface area of MgO and the area of the resulting catalyst can be much lower than that of the starting support (e.g. chloride ions [7,8] ). The surface of the pores developed during calcination need not be covered by the active phase. High surface area MgO is converted to a low surface area mixture of MgCO3 and Mg(OH)2 even upon standing at ambient atmosphere [ 10]. The isoelectric point of magnesia is about 11-12 (e.g. [ 12 ] ). Part of this support can be dissolved during impregnation by solutions of ammonium heptamolybdate or nickel nitrate having a pH in the range 5-7. A slurry of equimolar amounts of the powders of MgO and MoO3 in water reacts to give a clear solution of very soluble magnesium molybdate within several minutes of boiling [ 13]. The mag- nesia species dissolved during impregnation precipitate together with impregnation salts during drying. This also strongly influences the composition and texture of the surface layers of the catalyst precursor. All these complications caused by the instability of magnesia in aqueous solutions are relatively well recognized in catalysis over metals [9,10] and oxides [ 12] but have not been considered in catalysis over sulfides. In our previous work [ 13 ] we have tried to optimize the preparation of a Ni- Mo/MgO sulfide catalyst by impregnation in aqueous solutions and by precipita- E.

However, the best catalyst obtained exhibited only 30% of the HDS activity of the commercial alumina sup- ported sample Shell 324. The dissolution of MgO during impregnation was blocked by using a high pH of 12 of the ammonium molybdate solution as seen in the recent paper on the MoO3/MgO oxidation catalyst [ 12]. However, the transformation of MgO to Mg (OH)2 has not been suppressed by this precaution. It is concluded that the presence of water is the principal obstacle in preparation of Ni-Mo/MgO sulfide catalysts by aqueous impregnation. Therefore, the purpose of the present paper was to test the possibility of by-passing contact with water by the impregnation of MgO from non-aqueous solutions of metal salts. 2. Experimental 2.1. Support The five forms of MgO support used are characterized in Table 1. The commercial fine powder MgO ( 1 ) was treated in various ways also described in Table 1 in order to increase its surface area and to obtain particles with reasonable mechanical strength for use in a fixed bed flow reactor. The hydration-calcination treatment is a well known method for the preparation of high surface area MgO, e.g. [8]. The powder form of Mg (OH) 2 was calcined in a crucible [ MgO (2a) ]. Slow drying of a paste of Mg (OH)2 at ambient temperature provided nodules of good mechanical strength which were calcined in a flow reactor [ MgO (2b) and MgO (4) ].

Catalysts Three types of Ni-Mo/MgO catalysts were prepared and tested: series IA by aqueous impregnation of MgO, series P by precipitation-adsorption of sulfides in a water-toluene emulsion, and series INA by non-aqueous impregnation of MgO. All catalysts are characterized in Table 2. The preparation of catalysts of the IA and P series was described in detail elsewhere [ 13 ] ; the numbering of samples corresponds to that used in the previous paper. The catalysts of the series INA were dried in a rotary vacuum evaporator which was modified in order to facilitate the removal of the high-boiling solvent dimeth- ylsulfoxide (DMSO, b.p. 189. The vacuum line was connected to a glass tube which ended about 1 cm above the level of the slurry in the rotating flask. The vapours of DMSO were sucked off through the vacuum tube and did not condense in the condenser. Odour products formed by slight decomposition of DMSO were disposed of by dissolution in a water jet pump. A motor driven agate mortar used for densification of the powders was of the type described in ref. [ 14].

E. Hillerov6 et al. /Apphed Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) 111-125 115 the preparation of heterogeneous catalysts can be found for instance in ref. [ 15 ]. Catalyst INA(1) was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. 2.6 g of ammonium heptamolybdate was dissolved in 20 ml of DMSO at approx. 150 and the volume was adjusted to 21.5 ml. One tenth (2.15 ml) of this solution was added at approx. 120 to 1.5 g of MgO(2b) and was dried for 0.5 h at 150. 1.86 g of NiSO4.7H20 was dissolved at approx. 150 in DMSO to a total volume of 21.5 ml. Again 2.15 ml of this solution was mixed with the Mo/MgO sample and dried for 0.5 h at 150. The sample was not calcined. Catalysts INA (2) and INA (3) were obtained by sequential impregnation (not incipient wetness) using the supports MgO( 1 ) and MgO(2a), respectively. 0.337 g of ammonium heptamolybdate was dissolved in 3.5 ml of DMSO at about 150 and the hot solution was mixed with 1.5 g of support. After standing for 2 h at 100, the mixture was dried for 1 h at 150. The resulting solid was kneaded for 45 min in an agate mortar with a solution of 0.214 g of Ni(NO3)2\" 6H20 in 3 ml of methanol. The paste was placed in a Petri dish and the methanol evaporated during 1.5 h at room temperature in a fume chamber. The solid was dried in a rotary evaporator at 60-80 for 1 h. The catalysts were crushed and sieved to a particle size fraction of 0.16--0.32 mm and were not calcined. Catalyst INA(4) was prepared using the carrier MgO(4). 20 g of MgO and 4.5 g of ammonium heptamolybdate were ground in a porcelain mortar to obtain a fine powder. 70 ml of DMSO was added and the slurry was placed into the 250 ml flask of the evaporator. It was rotated at room temperature and pressure for 20 min. The temperature was increased in 10 min to 150 and the flask was rotated for 20 min with a gentle stream of air sucked through the evaporator at atmospheric pressure. The purpose of this step was to dissolve the ammonium heptamolybdate. The mixture was dried for 30 min at 150-170 in vacuum. The flask was cooled and the solid was crushed into smaller particles (below 5 mm) and the drying at 150- 170 in vacuum continued for 2.5 h. 25 g of solid was obtained. It was mixed with a solution of 2.9 g of Ni(NO3)2\" 6H20 in 50 ml of methanol and kneaded in an agate mortar for 50 min. Methanol was evaporated and the sample was dried in the evaporator in the same way as described above for samples INA(2) and INA (3). The catalyst was crushed and sieved to a particle size fraction 0.164).32 mm and was calcined in a fixed bed reactor in a flow of air. The temperature was linearly increased in 40 min to 300 and kept at this value for 30 min. The behaviour of the Ni-Mo/MgO catalysts was compared with the reference alumina supported catalyst Shell 324. Its composition is shown in Table 2. Extru- dates were crushed and sieved to a particle size fraction 0.16-0.32 mm. 2.3. Measurement of catalytic properties The fixed-bed flow reactor has been described in detail elsewhere [ 16 ]. Catalysts were presulfided in situ with a H2S/H2 mixture ( 1 : 10) at 400 for 2 h. Two independent tests were made: (i) HDS of thiophene (TH) in absence of pyridine 116 E. Hillerov6 et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) 111-125 (PY), and (ii) concurrent HDS of TH and HDN of PY. The procedure was the same as in our previous papers [ 17] and [ 16]. The activity in HDS of TH in the absence of PY was measured at a total pressure of 1.6 MPa. The feed concentration of TH was 400 mole ppm, the feed rate, F(TH), was 0.6 mmol h- 1, the feed rate of hydrogen was 1.5 mol h- 1, and catalyst charge, W, was 0.01 g. HDS conversion of TH was defined as x(HDS)= (nTH) -n(TH))/nTH), where nTH) and n(TH) are the initial and final number of moles of TH, respectively. The amount of tetrahydrothiophene formed was negligible. The conversion at a fixed value of W/F(TH) was sequentially determined at six temperatures from 400 to 300 in steps of 20. It was checked by separate experiments that no deactivation of the catalysts occurred during the 8 h on stream. The activity in the concurrent HDS of TH and HDN of PY was measured at a total pressure of 2.0 MPa and a temperature of 320 and 350. The feed concen- trations of TH and PY were 230 and 200 mole ppm, respectively. F(TH) was 0.092 mmol h- 1, F(PY) was 0.080 mmol h- 1, the feed rate of hydrogen was 0.4 mol h- 1, and W varied in the range from 0.06 to 0.40 g. The HDS conversion of TH in presence of PY, x(HDS,PY), was defined in the same way as in absence of PY. The products of PY reaction were piperidine (PI), C5 hydrocarbons (C5), and ammonia. The course of the reaction was described by three conversions: the overall conversion of PY, x (PY) = (n o (py) _ n (PY)) / n o (py), the conversion of PY to PI, x(PI)=n(PI)/nPY), and the HDN conversion of PY, x(C5)=n(C5)/ nPY), where ni) and n(i) are the initial and final number of moles, respec- tively. Each catalyst was tested at 2-3 different values of the space time W/F. The run at each W/F was made with fresh catalyst charge; each charge was tested at two temperatures. The steady state conversions were reached after 3-6 h on stream. The activity of samples was normalized to the weight of catalyst and not to the amount of metals, even when the content of metals in the compared catalysts was not exactly the same. However, only large differences in the activity are discussed and the conclusions are independent of the way of normalization. Surface area was measured by the adsorption of nitrogen using the single point flow method of Nelson and Eggertson [ 18]. 3. Results and discussion The present paper describes preparation and catalytic properties in HDS and in parallel HDS and HDN of catalysts of the INA series obtained by non-aqueous impregnation. The preparation of the catalysts of the IA and P series was described elsewhere [ 13 ]; their HDS activity in the single reaction of TH was measured previously [ 13 ] and their performance in parallel HDS and HDN was measured in the present work. Only typical samples of the IA and P series were selected for the present discussion. They represent the catalysts prepared in aqueous solutions as E. Hillerov6 et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) 111-125 117 for the highest activity achieved in the series IA and P, the typical behaviour in the inhibition of HDS by parallel HDN and in the selectivity to HDN versus HDS. The details of their preparation are not important for the present discussion. 3.1. Chemistry of impregnation Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is a powerful solvent of inorganic salts [ 19] and was selected to deposit ammonium heptamolybdate and nickel sulfate. It is rela- tively stable at temperatures up to the boiling point (189) but transition metal ions can catalyze its decomposition [ 19 ]. In order to minimize the decomposition the impregnation and drying temperature was kept below 170. A solution of nickel nitrate in DMSO was not used because of the danger of oxidation of the DMSO during drying. Nickel nitrate was dissolved in methanol which can be removed from the catalyst at low temperatures. The second reason for the selection of methanol was that this solvent does not attack the intermediate solid MOO3/ MgO, (NH4)6MoTO24/MgO or MgMoO4/MgO in the catalyst preparation; it was checked that the solubility of ammonium heptamolybdate and magnesium molyb- date in boiling methanol is negligible. Alumina is an amphoteric support and both molybdenum anions and ammonia cations are retained in the dried catalyst; the removal of ammonia only occurs in the course of calcination. Magnesia is a strongly basic support and that is the reason why ammonia is much less retained in the catalyst precursor. It was observed previously [ 13 ] in the preparation of Ni-Mo/MgO catalysts by aqueous impreg- nation that ammonia evolved from the sample already during the course of drying. The same phenomenon occurred during non-aqueous impregnation in the present work. For instance, in the preparation of sample INA(4) an ammonia odour was detected above the mixture of MgO-DMSO-ammonium heptamolybdate even at room temperature. This indicates a strong interaction of molybdenum ions with the surface which can be understood as formation of surface magnesium molybdate species. 3.2. Surface area The high surface area magnesia samples are not stable at room temperature and ambient atmosphere. The value of the surface area of magnesia obtained by BET measurement strongly depends on the details of in situ pretreatment such as the temperature programme, final temperature, type of gas, flow-rate of gas, and the amount of the sample. This behaviour is known for the MgO support alone [ 10] and similar results were reported in the previous paper on Ni-Mo/MgO catalysts prepared by aqueous impregnation [ 13 ]. In the present work, the effect of non-aqueous solvents and solutions on the surface area of MgO was compared with the effect of water and aqueous solutions. The results are presented in Table 3. 118 E. Hillerovd et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) 111-125 Table 3 Changes in surface area of the support MgO(2a) after various treatments a Operation Temperature of in-situ pretreatment b 25 300 Stored 5 days in sealed ampoule 165 Stored 5 days in air 76 Blank impregnation experiment with pure water, dried at 100 30 Blank impregnation experiment with pure DMSO, dried at 150 163 Blank impregnation experiment with pure methanol, dried at 80 200 Impregnation with aqueous solutions of AHM and nickel nitrate, 10 dried at 100 Impregnation by AHM in DMSO, dried at 150 72 Impregnation by AHM in DMSO, dried at 150, impregnated by 41 nickel nitrate in methanol, dried at 80 170 103 120 172 210 90 131 126 a Measured immediately after indicated operation, dried in rotary vacuum evaporator, AHM is ammonium hep- tamolybdate, DMSO is dimethylsulfoxide, surface area is in m2 g- 1 b For 15 min in flow of H2 + N2 (6: 1 ) at the indicated temperature. The collapse of surface area during aqueous impregnation is documented by the blank experiment with water. This collapse does not occur in the treatment by non- aqueous solvents. The interesting phenomenon is some increase (about 20%) in the surface area after the blank experiment with methanol, but the explanation would require a more detailed study. The contact with non-aqueous solutions of metal salts seems to have a more negative effect on the surface area than with the pure solvents DMSO and methanol. One possible explanation in the case of non-aqueous solutions is the reaction with the water introduced to the solutions in the form of crystal water of the dissolved salts. The results in Table 3 confirmed the working hypothesis of the present work that non-aqueous impregnation is more favourable for the preservation of surface area of the magnesia support than aqueous impregnation. 3.3. Optimization of preparation A number of modifications to the preparation of the Ni-Mo/MgO catalyst have been tested in the present work. Samples INA( 1 )-INA(4) described in the Exper- imental Section 2 represent typical preparations and the most active catalysts. Before a detailed discussion of catalytic properties it is useful to summarize the most important points of our experience in preparing an active catalyst. (i) Commercial magnesia must be treated by hydration--calcination to obtain a high surface area support. The calcined support must be either immediately used or stored in a well sealed vial. (ii) It is not necessary to prepare a solution of ammonium heptamolybdate in DMSO as the first step of impregnation. It is more convenient to mix the support E.

Ammonium hepta- molybdate is dissolved and deposited during drying. The relatively fast removal of the solvent DMSO is recommended to limit the formation and dissolution of mag- nesium molybdate. (ii) Kneading of the uncalcined Mo/MgO precursor with a solution of nickel nitrate in methanol and subsequent evaporation of the methanol at room temperature [as in preparation of samples INA(2), INA(3) and INA(4)] is a convenient method to deposit nickel and to obtain particles with good mechanical strength for calcination and testing in a flow reactor. 3.4. Definition and evaluation of activity and selectivity The purpose of the present work was a comparison of several catalysts and not a detailed kinetic study. The conversion independent indexes of activity were obtained by the correlation of the data pairs conversion x(i)-space time W/F by simple formal kinetics. The validity of this kinetics was confirmed by a more detailed measurement on the reference Ni-Mo/AI203 catalyst and by previous experience with other catalysts (platinum group metal sulfides [ 16] and Mo/C and Ni-Mo/C samples [ 17,20,21 ] ). It was assumed that this kinetics also holds for Ni-Mo/MgO catalysts and only conversions at 1-3 different values of W/F were measured for each sample. Only a brief description of the procedure is given in the present work and more details can be found in the previous papers on other catalysts [ 16,17]. The relative HDS activity in the absence of PY, krel (HDS), was calculated from the equation ki(HDS) In(1-xi(HDS)) krel(HDS) =kr(HDS) ln(1-xr(HDS)) ' (1) where k/(HDS) and kr(HDS) was the pseudo first-order rate constant on the i-th Ni-Mo/MgO and the reference Ni-Mo/A1203 catalyst, respectively. The HDS conversions x(HDS) were in the range of 0.1-0.9 depending on catalyst and temperature. The relative HDS activity in the presence of PY, kre~(HDS,PY), was defined as k,(HDS,PY) k~el (HDS,PY) - (2) kr ( HDS,PY ) The conversions x(HDS,PY) at 2-3 different ~alues of W/F were measured and the pseudo first-order rate constants k(HDS,PY) were obtained by the non-linear regression of data. The definition of HDN activity was more complicated. The kinetics of the HDN reaction was described by the reaction scheme of two consecutive pseudo first- order reactions 120 E. Hillerov6 et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) 111-125 k(PY) k(C5) PY ~ PI ~ C5 + NH3 The pairs of conversions x(PY)-x(C5) at two or three different values of W/F were measured for each catalyst, and the constants k(PY) and k(C5) were calcu- lated by non-linear regression (the used integral kinetic equations were presented previously [ 16] ). The conversions x(PY) were in the range of 0.05-0.9. However, the constants k (PY) and k (C5) are not proper indices of HDN activity. The degree of HDN depends on both these constants in a rather complicated manner (for the corresponding equation x(C5) =f(k(PY),k(C5),W/F), see ref. [ 16] ). The reciprocal value of W/F(PY) at which x(C5) = 0.5 was used as the measure of HDN activity, A(HDN). The relative values Are~(HDN) of Ni-Mo/MgO sam- ples were normalized to the activity of the reference Ni-Mo/A1203 catalyst. 3.5. HDS activity in absence of PY The relative rate constants kr~ (HDS) were independent of temperature, indicat- ing that apparent activation energies on different samples were the same. The values of the constants are shown in Tables 4 and 5. The best Ni-Mo/MgO catalyst prepared in an aqueous environment was the sample IA(4) having 30% of the activity of the reference alumina supported catalyst. This is in good agreement with ref. [ 5 ] where HDS conversions of ben- zothiophene were 0.17 and 0.05 over Mo/A1203 and Mo/MgO catalysts prepared by aqueous impregnation, respectively. It seems that the possibility of improving Table 4 Relative HDS activity of Ni-Mo/MgO catalysts in separated HDS ofthiophene and in concurrent HDS ofthiophene and HDN of pyridine at temperature of 320 Catalyst k~e~ ( HDS ) k~e~(HDS,PY ) k(HDS)/k (HDS,PY) Impregnation in aqueous solution IA( 1 ) 0.17 0.66 6.4 IA(4) 0.30 - - Precipitation-adsorption in water-toluene emulsion P( 1 ) 0.17 0.69 6.2 P(2) 0.16 0.49 8 2 P(5) 0.13 0.37 8.8 Impregnation in non-aqueous solution INA( l ) 0.60 1.45 10.3 INA(2) 0.43 - - INA(3) 0.68 1.80 9.4 INA(4) 0.94 2.95 8.1 Reference Ni-Mo/alumma catalyst Shell 325 1.0 1.0 25 E.

The samples prepared by non-aqueous impregnation were much more active, the best sample INA(4) having about the same activity as the Shell 324 catalyst. It should be mentioned that in selecting the Shell catalyst as being representative of alumina supported catalysts, the level of standard HDS activity was set rather high. The Shell catalyst contains about 15% more active metals than the INA(4) sample and is promoted by phosphorus. It is concluded that magnesia does not exhibit any specific negative effect on the activity of the sulfide phase in comparison with alumina. The only problem is to by-pass the instability of magnesia in aqueous solutions. It is believed that further optimization of non-aqueous impregnation is possible. 3.6. HDN activity The previous data on the comparison of Ni-Mo/A1203 and Ni-Mo/MgO cata- lysts are not available in the literature. Hattori et al. [6] reported that HDN con- version of quinoline was 0.40 and 0.08 over Mo/A1203 and Mo/MgO catalysts prepared by aqueous impregnation, respectively. The results of the present work are summarized in Table 6. The activity of the catalysts of the series IA and P prepared in the presence of water was low. On the other hand, the activity of the best catalyst prepared by non-aqueous impregnation, INA(4), was similar to the activity of the reference alumina supported sample. It again confirms that non- aqueous impregnation is the proper method to~ overcome the hydrothermal insta- bility of magnesia and that magnesia supported catalysts with high HDN activity can be prepared. 3.7. HDS activity in presence of PY HDS activity of alumina supported Co-Mo and Ni-Mo catalysts is strongly inhibited by concurrent HDN [ 22-26]. This was also observed in the present work. 122 E. Hillerov6 et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) 111-125 Table 6 Relative HDN activity of Ni-Mo/MgO catalysts in concurrent HDN of pyridine and HDS of thiophene Catalyst AwI(HDN) 350 320 Impregnation in aqueous solution IA(1) 0.15 0.22 Precipitation-adsorption in wa~r-~luene emubton P(I) 0,07 0.13 P(2) 0,06 0.13 P(5) 0.06 0.13 Impregnatton in non-aqueous solution INA( 1 ) 0.32 0.38 INA(3) 0.34 0.40 INA(4) 0.94 1.05 Reference Ni-Mo/alumma catalyst Shell 324 1.0 1.0 The inhibition factor k(HDS)/k(HDS,PY) in Tables 4 and 5 was 25 and 10 for the Shell catalyst at 320 and 350, respectively. No previous comparison of the inhibition of alumina and magnesia supported catalysts has been reported in the literature. The results in Tables 4 and 5 show that the inhibition factor k(HDS)/k(HDS,PY) is systematically much lower for Ni- Mo/MgO than for Ni-Mo/AIzO3 samples. Inhibition of alumina supported cata- lysts has been explained by the strong acido-basic interaction of basic nitrogen compounds with the catalyst surface [ 22]. The lower inhibition of magnesia sup- ported catalysts observed in the present work is explained by the lower acidity of the support, resulting in a lower affinity of the catalyst surface to basic nitrogen compounds. The different inhibition has an important consequence. The HDS activity of the Ni-Mo/MgO samples relative to alumina supported standard is higher in the pres- ence of PY than in the absence of it. At 320 the best Ni-Mo/MgO sample INA(4) was about three times more active than the Shell 324 catalyst (Table 4). In contradistinction to krel(HDS) which was independent of temperature, the relative activity kre~ (HDS,PY) decreased with increasing temperature (comparison of Table 4 and 5). This indicates that the apparent activation energy of HDS in the presence of PY is lower on magnesia than on alumina supported samples. However, even at 350 the sample INA(4) still exhibits about two times higher activity than the reference alumina supported catalyst. 3.8. Selectivity HDN versus HDS Hydrorefining catalysts with increased activity and selectivity to HDN are required in the processing of heavy and synthetic feedstocks [27-30]. The selec- E.

Selectivity S(HDN/HDS) in concurrent hydrodenitrogenation (EIDN) of pyddine and hydrodesulfudza- tion (HDS) of thiophene at 320. Present work: ( Ni-Mo/MgO (typical points of various IA, P, and INA samples),(O) Ni-Mo/alumina, Shell 324. Previous data: (~) Ni-Mo/graphitized carbon, ref. [32], ( Ni- Mo/alumina, laboratory sample, ref. [33], (~) Mo/active carbon, ref. [31 ], (~9) Ni/active carbon, ref. [31 ]. tivity to HDN versus HDS, S(HDN/HDS), of the conventional alumina supported systems Co-Mo and Ni-Mo is low. The Ni-Mo catalyst is somewhat more selective than the Co-Mo system but HDN is always more difficult than HDS over these catalysts. The fundamental question is whether it is possible to uncouple the HDN and HDS reactions (whether HDN can be faster than HDS) and what is the range in which the selectivity S(HDN/HDS) can be changed by variation of the active phase or support. Increased selectivity to HDN was found for some unconventional active phases: Fe-Mo-S, Fe-W-S [30], Mo-S, Ni-S [31], Pt-S, Ir-S [ 16,31]. The effect of the support was studied much less and no previous work compared Ni-Mo/A1203 and Ni-Mo/MgO samples in this respect. The selectivity of the Ni-Mo/MgO catalysts of the present work is evaluated graphically in Fig. 1. The data on various other catalyst previously tested in our laboratory are plotted for comparison. The Ni-Mo/MgO catalysts exhibited extremely low selectivity to HDN. Even at the high HDS conversion of about 0.95, the HDN conversion was still low at about 0.10. The Ni-Mo/MgO system seems to represent the lowest limit of S(HDN/HDS) selectivity reported up to now. A very low selectivity S(HDN/HDS) of the Ni-Mo/MgO catalyst can be useful outside the field of fuel processing, for instance in the field of fine chemicals. The example might be the removal of thiophene from crude pyridine; for this process, hydrogenation over a Ni-Mo/AIEO3 catalyst has been patented [ 34]. 4. Conclusions Textural and chemical instability of the high surface area MgO support in water is the principal obstacle in the preparation of Ni-Mo/MgO sulfide catalyst by 124 E. Hillerovd et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) 111-125 conventional impregnation using aqueous solutions of salts. This difficulty can be by-passed by a preparation using non-aqueous solutions. The best Ni-Mo/MgO sample prepared by non-aqueous impregnation exhibited similar or better HDS and HDN activity when compared with an industrial Ni-Mo/ A1203 catalyst Shell 324 (depending on testing reaction and temperature). The special feature of Ni-Mo/MgO catalysts as compared with conventional Ni-Mo/A1203 samples was the lower inhibition of HDS by concurrent HDN and a lower selectivity to HDN in parallel HDN and HDS.

Magnesia supported Ni—Mo sulfide catalysts were prepared by three methods: by impregnation from aqueous solutions, by precipitation-adsorption of Sulfides in a water-toluene emulsion, and by impregnation from non-aqueous solutions using dimethylsulfoxide and methanol as solvents. They were tested in: (i) the single hydrodesulfurization of thiophene (HDS), and (ii) the parallel hydro-desulfurization of thiophene (HDS,PY) and the hydrodenitrogenation of pyridine (HDN). The reference Ni-Mo / alumina catalyst was the commercial sample Shell 324. The catalytic activity of samples prepared by aqueous impregnation and by precipitation-adsorption was low, activity for (HDS) and (HDN) of the best sample being only about 30 and 20%, respectively, of the activity of the Shell 324 catalyst at 320°C. The chemical and textural instability of the high surface area magnesia in aqueous solutions was the limiting factor. Much higher activity was achieved by non-aqueous impregnation, activity of the best Ni-Mo/MgO sample prepared by this method for (HDS), (HDS,PY) and (HDN) being 94,290 and 105%, respectively, of the activity of the Shell 324 catalyst at 320°C. As compared with the alumina supported catalyst, the special feature of the Ni-Mo/MgO catalysts irrespective of the preparation method was lower inhibition of HDS by parallel HDN and lower selectivity to HDN in parallel HDN and HDS.
