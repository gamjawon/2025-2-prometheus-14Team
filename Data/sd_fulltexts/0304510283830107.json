P. J. VERLAAN, C. E. KONING and G. CHALLA Laboratory of Polymer Chemistry, State University of Groningen, Nijenborgh 16, 9747 AG Groningen (The Netherlands) (Received November 22, 1982) Summary Copolymers of styrene and 4-vinylpyridine have been utilized as macro- molecular ligands for copper. The intrinsic activities of unbound and anchored macromolecular copper catalysts were identical in the oxidative coupling reaction of 2,6-di-t-butylphenol. Anchorage to silica resulted in a decrease of the equilibrium constant for substrate complexation because of water enrichment around the non-porous silica spheres. This effect could be suppressed by silanization of the silica support, and after such treatment higher substrate complexation equilibrium constants were observed than for unbound macromolecular catalysts. However, partial adsorption of the macromolecular ligands on to the silanized silica support occurred, leading to deactivation of catalytically active sites. This adsorption was strongly influenced by the nature of the silica surface and by the polarity of the co- monomer, e.g. styrene or methyl methacrylate, in the macromolecular amine. Introduction Many chemical transformations only occur because of the phenomenon of catalysis, but separation of catalysts and products is still necessary if clean products are to be obtained. In homogeneous catalysis such separation is very often laborious if not impossible, and even if the catalyst is regained it very often cannot be re-used because of deactivation. For these reasons the development of heterogeneous catalysts is often of great practical impor- tance [1-5]. Furthermore, they can be used in continuous flow processes instead of batch operations. Binding ligands directly to a support is an elegant way of anchoring metal complexes, and finds application in liquid-phase catalysis. To achieve virtually undisturbed ligand mobility, they are best bound to a flexible 0304-6102/83/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 204 matrix. For this reason linear macromolecules are to be preferred in most cases to crosslinked networks [6]. Indeed, multifunctional catalysis can be achieved if the microenvironment is adapted in conjunction with tailor-made macromolecules. Completely soluble macromolecular metal complexes are easily acces- sible for characterization. Unfortunately macromolecular metal catalysts are still incapable of ready separation from reaction mixtures, although anchorage of such complexes to supports has yielded satisfactory separation results [7] and successful applications in continuous flow processes [8]. The influence of the support itself on the catalytic process is the subject of the present study. Oxidative coupling of phenols is undertaken as a batch process in industry with completely soluble catalysts, and hence only a few publications have dealt with the use of heterogeneous oxidative coupling catalysts [9, 10]. As a simple model reaction we have chosen the oxidative coupling of 2,6-di-t-butylphenol (DTBP) which leads exclusively to the C C coupling product diphenoquinone (DPQ)*: The catalytically active complexes used in this work were binuclear amine copper complexes [II], while anchored macromolecular amine ligands were achieved through the synthesis of a radical initiator bound to silica, followed by copolymerization of 4-vinylpyridine and styrene [7]. The kinetics of oxidative coupling may be described in terms of the Michaelis-Menten concept for enzyme catalysis [12,13]: fei k-t E + S f=^ ES > E + P fe-i (1) where E depicts the catalyst, S the substrate (DTBP) and P the product (DPQ). The application of steady-state kinetics to this reaction yields: -R=fe2([E]o[S]o)/(^m+[S]o) (2) where R is the initial rate in mol dm~3 s~1, [E]o and [S]o are the initial con- centrations of copper salt and DTBP, fe; ls the rate-determining rate constant in s~1 and -Km = (fe-1 + k^lky is the Michaelis constant in mol dm~3. Experimental Synthesis of unbound copolymers All the monomers employed were distilled under nitrogen at reduced pressure. Radical copolymerizations in toluene using AIBN as an initiator at *DPQ = 4-( 3,5-di-t-butyl-4-oxo-2,5-cyclohexadien-l-ylidene)-2,6-di-t-butyl-2,6-cyclo- hexadien-1-one. 205 60 C were performed according to the method of Fuoss and co-workers for the preparation of poly(styrene-4-vinylpyridine) [14] and according to that of Tamikado for poly(methyl methacrylate-4-vinylpyridine) [15]. The copolymers thus obtained were purified by reprecipitation from chloroform with n-pentane and dried in vacuo at 50 C. The degree of functionalization a. (a = mole fraction of pyridine units in the copolymers) was determined by elemental analysis (C, H, N) and maintained at ca. 0.25 by the proper control of the copolymerization conditions. The viscosity average molecular weight. My, was determined by the Ubbelohde technique using chloroform as a solvent at 25 C, and the number average molecular weight, Mn, was determined in toluene with a Knauer-type membrane osmometer. Synthesis of the silica-bound radical initiators and subsequent graft copoly- merization The radical initiator anchored to silica (Aerosil 200V, Degussa) was synthesized according to the method of Fery and co-workers [16]. Graft copolymerization of styrene and 4-vinylpyridine was performed as de- scribed in a previous paper [ 7 ]. Synthesis of bound radical initiator onto hydrophobic silica and subsequent graft copolymerization After coupling the p-nitrobenzyl moiety to the silica (Aerosil 200V) [16], 30 g of the purified and dried sample were dispersed in 500 ml toluene. Next 40 ml (0.32 mol) of trimethylchlorosilane was added and the reaction mixture was refluxed for 3 h. After cooling, the brownish suspen- sion was poured with caution into a large excess of methanol/water (l/l,v/v) to hydrolyze the excess trimethylchlorosilane and to dissolve the HC1. After filtration, the precipitate was washed several times with methanol/ water and with water until a pH ^ 7 was achieved. The precipitate was subsequently washed with water, ethanol, acetone and ether, and the result- ing white powder dried in vacuo at 40 C (IR: ^(CHs): 2960 cm\"1 (w)). Reduction and diazotization of the nitrophenyl group anchored to the hydrophobic silica was performed as previously described for normal silica [7]. Oxidative coupling Reaction rates were determined by measuring the oxygen uptake with an isobaric automatic gas burette. The standard conditions applied [7] were: [Cu2\"*\"] = [OH-] = 0.5 X [pyridine ligand] = 3.32 X 10\"3 mol dm-3; [phenol] = 0.06 mol dm-3, T = 298.16 K, Py = 101.3 kPa. Solvent mixture: l,2-dichlorobenzene/methanol= 13/2 (v/v). Copper was added as Cudz- 2H:;0. Results and Discussion Anchorage of complete macromolecular catalysts to an inert support has led to a successful method for separating catalysts and reaction products 206 by a simple and easy method with complete preservation of catalyst activity [7,8]. Unfortunately, the reaction rates observed in the presence of anchored catalysts were sometimes half as great as in the presence of the unbound macromolecular analogues. However, unchanged k^ values for such reactions show that the intrinsic activities of catalytic sites with unbound and anchored catalysts are identical [7]. Since fe2[E]o remains unaltered, changes in K^ = ki/(k-i +fez) must reflect changes in K.i=ki/k-i. Hence the apparent decrease in reaction rates after anchorage may be attributed entirely to a decrease in the complexation constant for the substrate Ky (see eqn. 1). The decrease in -K\") appears to be greater for lower degrees of loading 6 (= polymer weight fraction of the particles) [8]. Obviously higher silica 'concentrations' (lower 8) yield smaller JK\\ values. This may be brought about by an increase in the aqueous environment in the vicinity of the rather hydrophilic silica spheres. Indeed the addition of water to the unbound macromolecular catalyst results in decreased reaction rates (Fig. 1). At higher water concentrations a levelling off in reaction rate occurs. Measurements have been made of the concentration dependence of the substrate. Plots of the reaction rates against the reciprocal substrate concentration should yield straight lines (so-called Lineweaver-Burk plots) in conformance with the equation 1/R = l/(&2[E]o) + KJ(k^[E]o[S]o) (3) After water addition at infinite substrate concentration (/^2[E]o=^max) the reaction rate derived from such a Lineweaver-Burk plot was equal to 6.4 X 10~5 mol dm\"3 s~1 indicating an unchanged activity and an unchanged number of total active sites. Only the value of K^ is reduced after water addition from 2.0 (no water added), to 0.83 in the presence of 20 water molecules per copper atom in the unbound macromolecular catalyst (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Obviously water solvates the copper complexes, and forms a barrier to the complexation of the somewhat non-polar 2,6-di-t-butylphenol which leads to a decrease in the value of JS\"i. Modification of the surface of the silica spheres should influence their hydrophilic character. To test this hypothesis, the silica was treated with trimethylchlorosilane yielding silica spheres which repel water molecules rather than attract them. After graft copolymerization and purification, the grafted spheres were converted into active oxidative coupling catalysts. The results of catalytic experiments with such catalysts are shown as Line- weaver-Burk plots in Fig. 3 where data for two silanized (o, ) and one unbound sample (n) are depicted. The K^ value (equal to the negative intercept on the ar-axis in accordance with eqn. 3) increases for the silanized samples. Moreover when the degree of loading is decreased, a higher K^ value is observed. With a smaller degree of loading at constant catalyst concentration, a larger amount of hydrophobic silica is present in the neighbourhood of the catalytic centres, and hence a greater percentage 207 Fig. 1.

This is in complete agreement with what was expected and will be discussed further below. Numerical values derived from the Lineweaver-Burk plots are sum- marized in Table 1. For the unbound catalyst as well as when the catalyst is anchored to hydrophilic silica, -Rmax is equal to 6.4 X 10~5 mol dm~3 s~1. However, when the catalyst is anchored on hydrophobic silica -Rmax is reduced from a value of 6.4 X 10~5 to 1.3 X 10~5 mol dm\"3 s~1 for 6 = 0.34 and to a value of 0.8 X lO\"5 mol dm\"3 s~1 for 9 = 0.21. Silanization of silica only changes the polarity of the silica surface and it is unlikely that this would influence the intrinsic activity of catalytic sites bound to macro- molecular ligands anchored to the surface. Hence it may be assumed that /?2 remains unaltered in the case of silanized samples, and that the decrease in -Rmax (= k^[E]o) after silanization must be due to a decrease in the total number of sites [E]o. Since the oxidative coupling reaction is first order in catalyst concentration [8], the decrease in -Rmax is caused by an equiv- alent decrease in [E]o. Numerical values of the percentage of sites lost have also been calculated and are listed in Table 1. These show that a large number of sites are deactivated, possibly through partial adsorption of the macromolecular ligand onto the hydrophobic surface brought about by cooperative van der Waals' interaction between the macromolecule and the solid surface. A decrease in -Rmax was also observed after the addition of 200 mg (= 22 m2) hydrophobic silica (Aerosil R972) to the unbound poly(styrene-4- 209 vinylpyridine) catalyst. Thus, after the addition of the hydrophobic silica the reaction rate expressed as .Rmax decreased from 6.4 X ICT5 to 3.2 X 1CT5 mol dm\"3 s~1. Addition of a large amount of hydrophobic silica led to nearly complete loss of activity. Obviously adsorption of unbound macromolecular catalyst occurs. This is in sharp contrast to the unchanged activity observed after the addition of hydrophilic silica. After the addition of 200 mg hydro- phobic silica the K~^ value was equal to 2.8 dm3 mol~1. It is possible that the sites which are still active after the addition of hydrophobic silica are in the neighbourhood of the hydrophobic surface where the water concentration is rather small, thereby allowing K~^ to increase from 2.0 to 2.8 dm3 mol~1. Rough calculations of the total area covered by adsorbed polymer chains (assuming that the adsorption occurs as a flat monolayer) show that even when 0 = 0.21 there is not enough silica surface present to permit complete adsorption of the polymer chains. Hence some free polymer tails and loops will be left with catalytically active sites. The greater the area available, the greater the number of adsorp- tion sites present and hence the greater the adsorption. Thus a decrease in 6 (which may be identified with a larger number of adsorption sites) results in lower activities (Table 1; 0.8 versus 1.3). Furthermore, anchored macro- molecules adsorb to a greater extent than unbound macromolecules. It is known already that the homopolymer poly(methyl methacrylate) adsorbs strongly on hydrophilic silica [17], hence a change in the styrene moiety in the copolymers to methylmethacrylate should make the resulting polymers more polar. Consequently the adsorption behaviour should be reversed. To test this theory, a copolymer of methyl methacrylate and 4- vinylpyridine was synthesized (a = 0.25), and the reaction rates were again measured under standard conditions as a function of the substrate concen- tration. The net data from the Lineweaver-Burk plots obtained are sum- marized in Table 1. For this macromolecular catalyst, fez[E]o is equal to 4.6 X 10~5 mol dm\"3 s\"1 resulting in a k^ value of 0.014 s~1. The same value was found after addition of hydrophobic silica (Aerosil R972). Obviously the intrinsic activity of the methyl methacrylate copolymer is reduced (k-i= 0.014 versus 0.02 s~1 for the styrene copolymer), probably as a result of weak interaction between the ester carbonyl group of adjacent methyl- methacrylate units and the copper ion [18]. This secondary interaction of the macromolecular ligand slows down electron transfer from the substrate to the copper, a process which involves a configurational change from planar to tetrahedral in going from Cu\" to Cu'. After the addition of hydrophilic silica (110 mg (= 22 m2) Aerosil 200V), Emax is reduced from 4.6 X 10~5 to 3.2 X 10-5 mol dm\"3 s-1. If more silica is added, more activity is lost, indicating that deactivation of sites occurs because of adsorption. Moreover, the K,^ value after adsorption on to hydrophilic silica (1.9 dm3 mol\"1) is smaller than for the macromolecular catalyst without addition (2.6 dm3 moF'). Obviously the sites which are still active after partial adsorption onto hydrophilic silica are now in the vicinity of the parts of the hydrophilic silica where water enrichment occurs. 210 This results in a decrease of Ky^ as found previously for anchored styrene copolymer where 0.5 < JE'm1 < 1-2. Conclusions The presence of water and the polarities of the macromolecular ligand and support surface play an important role in the kinetics of the oxidative coupling of 2,6-di-t-butylphenol catalyzed by (anchored) macromolecular copper complexes. The following observations have been made: 1. The reaction rate is reduced by the addition of water, but the intrin- sic activity of the sites a unaffected and only the complexation constant of the substrate decreases with increasing water concentration. 2. Silanization of the surface of the silica support provides a successful method for reducing water enrichment around the silica, which leads to an increase in the complexation constant of the substrate. 3. The positive influence of improved complexation on the rate is counterbalanced by adsorption of anchored macromolecular catalyst, result- ing in a reduction in the number of active sites available. 4. The adsorption behaviour of macromolecular catalysts is strongly influenced both by the nature of the support surface and the polarity of the comonomer in the macromolecular ligand employed.

This adsorption was strongly influenced by the nature of the silica surface and by the polarity of the comonomer, e.g. styrene or methyl methacrylate, in the macromolecular amine.",
