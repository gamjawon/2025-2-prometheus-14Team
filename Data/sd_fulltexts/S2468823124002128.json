School of Materials Science and Engineering Smart Sensing Interdisciplinary Science Center Nankai University Tianjin 300350 China Heterogeneous catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene (PDH) has been considered an efficient technique in the olefins supply chains. Metallic Pt is recognized as a promising catalyst for PDH reaction on account of its excellent affinity to CH bonds and CH activation ability. However, monometallic Pt catalysts usually exhibit an unsatisfactory performance (poor selectivity toward propylene and low catalytic stability), which is attributed to the severe sintering of Pt particles and the coke formation during the dehydrogenation process. Various metal promoters (M) are ingeniously introduced into Pt-based catalysts functioning via the formation of Pt-M alloys and/or intermetallics. Besides, several supports suitable for Pt-based catalysts have been probed to achieve high Pt dispersion and strong metal-support interaction. In this review, we precede the introduction of promoters and supports applied in Pt-based catalysts with an overview of PDH reaction mechanism. The specific roles of the promoter addition along with the advantages and drawbacks of state-of-art supports are significantly highlighted. Current challenges and prospects for the future development of Pt-based catalysts are also discussed. Graphical abstract This comprehensive review systematically introduces and summarizes the utilization of metal promoters, such as Sn, Zn, Ga, and other metal promoters, as well as supports, including Al2O3, SiO2, zeolites, and carbon materials, in the context of the PDH reaction over Pt-based catalysts. Additionally, the underlying reaction mechanisms are also elaborately elucidated.

Traditional propylene production routes are based on the petroleum industry, including fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and diesel [2,3]. In recent years, the change in the world energy structure, resulting from the gradual depletion of petroleum energy resources, makes traditional propylene production processes untoward to meet the shortfall of the world propylene market [7–9]. Thus, it holds paramount importance to devise an economic and efficient approach for alleviating market pressures. In the past few decades, several novel propylene production methods have been proposed and applied to practical production. Among them, the most representative processes are the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [1–7] and the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) [10–12] techniques. MTO discovered by researchers of Mobil in 1977 is a process that utilizes small pore zeolites, for example, SAB-34, as catalysts to convert methanol to light olefins (ethylene propylene) [12]. Compared to the MTO process, the PDH technique is regarded as a highly promising method to implement the production of propylene, wherein propylene stands as the sole product [5]. Besides, the exploitation of shale gas which contains abundant propane resources makes propane an easy-access, cheap raw material and the PDH process a more economic method for propylene production [3,13-15]. With the development of PDH reaction research, many high-performance PDH catalysts have been explored and can be classified into two sorts: metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts. Based on these catalysts, PDH techniques, including Snamprogetti–Yarsintez FBD-4, ABB Lummus Catofin, Honeywell UOP Oleflex, Linde-BASF PDH, Phillips Star, China University of Petroleum ADHO, Dow Chemical Company FCDh and KB RK-PRO™, have emerged sequentially and been applied into commercial production, among which Lummus Catofin and UOP Oleflex have the most extensive application [16]. The Catofin technique utilizes a CrO x /Al2O3 catalyst which obtains high dehydrogenation activity and considerable propylene selectivity. However, the CrO x -based catalysts usually exhibits low efficiency due to rapid deactivation and could adversely affect the environment. Akin to CrO x -based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts commercially utilized in Oleflex technique have been demonstrated as efficient catalysts of PDH reaction due to their affinity for paraffinic CH bonds. However, though considered promising catalysts for PDH reaction, Pt-based catalysts have its inherent challenges and may rapidly deactivate in dehydrogenation processes. Pt-based catalysts usually suffer from weak catalytic stability and necessitate frequent regeneration. This thermal-induced deactivation of Pt-based catalysts is mainly attributed to the coke formation and the sintering of Pt active sites [17]. Briefly, the coke can severely restrain the catalytic stability and activity by poisoning Pt sites and/or blocking pore structure while the Pt sintering can cause a rapid reduction of active surface area and lead to the generation of undesired side reactions. Currently, introducing proper promoters, coupled with appropriate supports, can effectively regulate the Pt catalysts by adjusting the electronic effects, controlling Pt particle size, and enhancing the metal-support interaction. Numerous investigations have been dedicated to the exploration and documentation of Pt-based catalysts employed in PDH reaction, with the purpose of enhancing catalytic performance and elucidating the mechanistic intricacies inherent in the PDH process [18–20]. There is a relative lack of comprehensive reviews focusing on Pt catalysts. It is crucial to have a comprehensive review to reveal the reaction mechanism on Pt sites, discuss the promoters and the utilized supports, and clarify the current challenges. This review for Pt catalysts systematically compiles the published papers to comprehensively delineate advanced progresses in the mechanism revelation, progressive design involved promoters and supports, and challenge analysis. In this review, we proceed with a brief revelation of PDH reaction mechanisms on Pt-based catalysts. Several promoters conducive for Pt-based catalysts, such as transition metals (Zn, Co, Fe) and late transition metals (Sn, Ga, ln), are concisely and coherently introduced, with the highlighting of mechanism explanation. Besides, widely harnessed supports are introduced, including conventional metal oxides (SiO2 and Al2O3), zeolites, and carbon materials. Finally, the challenges and prospects on Pt-based catalysts are proposed. 2 Overview of PDH reaction on Pt-based catalysts The main PDH reaction (Reaction ( 1)) is conform to the reverse Horiuti−Polanyi mechanism [21]. The whole dehydrogenation process can be divided into three parts: (i) dissociative adsorption of alkane, (ii) removal of the β-H and the form of H2, (iii) desorption of alkene and H2. However, the rate-controlling step is still under-debate. Some scholars considered the dissociative adsorption process as the rate-controlling step while the others proposed that the removal of the second H was the rate-limiting step [22–26]. (1) C3H8 (g) → C3H6 (g) + H2 (g) (ΔH 298 θ = 124.3 kJ/mol) It is indicated that the main reaction is a thermodynamically limited highly endothermic process along with the increase of molecules in the gas. Thus, a high temperature (773–973 K) and moderately small partial pressure, usually 1 bar, are favored to achieve a high catalytic activity. (2) C3H8 (g) → CH4 (g) + C2H4 (g) (ΔH 298 θ = 98.9 kJ/mol) (3) C3H8 (g) + H2 (g) → C2H6 (g) + CH4 (g) (ΔH 298 θ = −37.7 kJ/mol) (4) C3H8 (g) → 3C (s) + 4H2 (g) (ΔH 298 θ = 119.5 kJ/mol) (5) C2H4 (g) + H2 (g) → C2H6 (g) (ΔH 298 θ = −136.6 kJ/mol) Such reaction conditions may cause many side reactions (Reactions (2)–(5)) which ruin the performance of the catalysts severely such as cracking of propane to ethylene and methane, hydrogenolysis, coke forming, deep dehydrogenation and hydrogenation. Plenty of studies have been carried out to dissect the route of PDH reaction over Pt-based catalysts through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experiments. Su et al. studied the complex reaction network including CH cleavage and CC cleavage in PDH reaction on Pt (111) surface (Fig. 1 (a)) and yield the number of each elementary step occurring through the KMC simulations (Fig. 1b) [27]. It was found that the main path of propane dehydrogenation to propylene was R2 and R5 while deep dehydrogenation mainly occurred via R6 and R10 and the cracking is via R28. The competition between C3H6 desorption and C3H6 dehydrogenation could be harnessed to evaluate the selectivity toward propylene [28]. The thermodynamics of 18 elementary reactions of the propylene dehydrogenation to propylidyne on Pt (111) surface were studied by DFT calculation. Considering the conversion from propylene to propylidyne is thermodynamics favorable, propylidyne was found to be the most stable species at the surface while propyne is thought to be the starting point of the break [29]. The desorption of propylene has a high energy barrier, which may lead to the side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation and decrease selectivity. Moreover, it is found that the addition of metal promoter Sn can significantly reduce the binding energy of propylene because of the downshift of d-band center. Many other promoters added to Pt catalysts to adjust the dehydrogenation routes have also been explored recently years and we will discuss them in the next section. 3 Promoters for Pt-based catalysts Pt-based catalysts have been widely proven as a kind of efficient propane dehydrogenation catalysts due to their affinity for paraffinic C–H bonds and been applied into UOP Oleflex technique [30,31]. However, Pt-based catalysts suffer from deactivation caused by coke formation, resulting from CC cleavage and deep dehydrogenation, and sintering of active sites under high reaction and regeneration temperature [32–35]. Combining Pt with other metals (M) to form Pt-M alloys or intermetallic compounds is an efficient approach to enhancing the activity and selectivity in PDH reaction as well as reducing the Pt cost. In the industrial production, Pt-Sn/Al2O3 rather than Pt/Al2O3 is utilized. However, PtSn/Al2O3 still encounters significant challenges such as Pt sintering and coke formation, both of which can lead to rapid deactivation. Besides, in practical production, an excess of metal promoters is typically employed to construct stable intermetallic compounds or alloys and prevent dealloying during dehydrogenation processes. During the PDH process, Pt-Sn nanoparticles may undergo separation into Sn and Pt atoms, ultimately resulting in the formation of SnO x and large Pt particles [17]. Excessive quantity of Sn is typically added to Pt-based catalysts (practical Sn:Pt ≈ 4 rather than ideal 0.3–1) to help in stabilizing the Pt-Sn alloy or intermetallic structure [36]. Many other metals are also chosen as promoters for Pt-based catalysts, such as Zn, Fe, Cu, Ga, Co, Mn, In and Pb, to adjust electronic property and promote the dispersion of Pt particles [3,17,18]. In this section, the representative promoters are comprehensively introduced with the highlight of electronic and geometric effects to Pt sites. The advanced design methods for Pt-M catalysts are also been introduced. 3.1 Sn Till now, Sn as a promoter of Pt-based catalysts is widely investigated. The selectivity can be improved and the coke formation reduced by alloying Pt with Sn by weakening binding of propylene [37]. The metal particle size and method of preparing Pt-Sn alloy have a great influence on the catalytic performance. For instance, Xu et al. reported a the controllable synthesis of Pt-Sn nanocluster based on this approach and obtained ultra-small bimetallic Pt-Sn clusters around 0.75 nm (Fig. 2 (a)) which exhibited high activity, selectivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation to propylene [38]. Recently, a silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles catalyst, which exhibited excellent stability and ultra-high selectivity (>99 %), was synthesized for PDH reaction [36]. It was found that atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor was preserved during the reduction and catalytic operation process resulted in this high catalytic performance. A surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) method was developed for the synthesis of Pt-Sn nanoparticles supported on MgAl2O4 catalyst with surface-enriched Sn [39]. Sn species specifically deposit on the surface of Pt–Sn bimetallic nanoparticles, which causes the high concentration of inactive Sn on the surface of the Pt nanoparticles and results in many isolated active Pt atoms. The resulting catalysts exhibited a remarkable activity, selectivity, and stability for PDH. Many works have been done to illuminate the electronic and geometric effects of the Sn doping [39–46]. The former pertains to the strong electronic transfer from promoter metals in different electronegativities to Pt, while the latter denotes to that the dilution of Pt by the promoters affects the adsorption modes and coverage. A strong electronic transfer between Pt and Sn makes Pt in a rich-electron state, beneficial to the desorption of propylene. In the previous report, the electronic state of Pt-Sn alloy was studied through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) [43]. The results indicated that alloying Pt with Sn given rise to a change of electronic structure of Pt atoms and caused a reduction of the local density of states near the Fermi level at Pt sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation, as an effective mathematical tool, was also performed to investigate the effect of Sn on the catalytic activity and selectivity of a Pt-based catalyst in propane dehydrogenation reaction [47]. The results indicated that with the increase of the Sn content, the d-band of Pt was broadened, which could give rise to a downshift in the d-band center on the Pt-Sn surfaces (Fig. 2(b)). The introduction of Sn increased the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation and simultaneously reduced the energy barrier for propylene desorption, which had a positive effect on the selectivity. In another report, density functional theory indicated that after the Pt-Sn alloy was formed, energy barrier of propylene dehydrogenation on Pt-Sn alloy was higher than propylene dehydrogenation energy barrier on sole Pt, as shown in Fig. 2(c) [45]. The geometry effect of the Sn introduction has also been revealed. The introduction of Sn can effectively improve the dispersion of Pt sites, which is responsible for the high dehydrogenation performance. The geometric function of Sn in a PtSn/Mg(Al)O catalyst was investigated, which manifested that Sn was mainly located at the steps, corners and edges of the Pt particles in PtSn/Mg(Al)O, thus developing simultaneously a geometric and a chemical effect on the surface properties of the exposed Pt atoms [48]. Kumar et al. analyzed the influence of Sn on the dispersion of Pt in a Pt-based supported SBA-15 catalyst [49]. This catalyst was characterized by N2-physisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM-EDXS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and H2-chemisorption, which revealed that the presence of Sn resulted in higher Pt dispersion by the formation of Pt-Sn alloy. The addition of Sn induced the formation of smaller Pt particles which exhibited high propane conversion and propylene selectivity. Recently, the segregation effect of Sn on a Pt-Sn catalyst was investigated by applying a acid etching technique to simulate the Sn loss on a Pt3Sn surface [50]. The Sn would migrate from the core to the shell during the PDH process, indicating that the Pt3Sn surface was thermodynamically preferable (Fig. 2(d)). The introduction of Sn promoted the recovery of active phases through Sn segregation and enabled Pt catalysts to overcome component fluctuations. ZnO x -based catalysts as promising catalysts for PDH reaction have been widely discussed [51–54]. Besides, Zn also serves as a promoter for Pt-based catalysts in PDH reaction by tuning the surface, structural, geometric, electronic properties and acidity of center active sites [55–61]. The formation of Pt-Zn alloy or intermetallic compounds is efficient methods to exert the function of Zn promoter. For instance, a Pt-Zn nanoalloy catalyst for PDH reaction was prepared through a ZnO deposition by atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique with subsequent processes including phase transformation process and reductive thermal treatment, as shown in Fig. 3 (a) [62]. The introduction of Zn induced a strong electronic interaction and a geometric modification of the active Pt surface, leading to high stability and propylene selectivity. Likely, a Pt-Zn alloy nanoparticle catalyst for propane dehydrogenation was synthesized through co-impregnation of precursor of Pt and Zn on mesoporous siliceous MFI zeolite nanosheets [57]. This mesoporous zeolite-supported Pt-Zn catalyst exhibited high activity and selectivity with remarkably long catalytic lifetime (Fig. 3(b) and (c)). The isolated silanol groups on the surface of the mesoporous zeolite promoted the formation of Pt-Zn alloy by obviously abating the reduction temperature of Zn species, thus allowing more effective alloying Zn with Pt. Gong et al. reported a single-site [PtZn4] intermetallic catalyst by assembling atomically ordered intermetallic alloy (IMA) as a selective and ultra-stable catalyst [56]. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in Pt-Zn IMAs functioned as the key active site structures, in which the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt1 site in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promoted the first and second C–H cleavage of propane but inhibited further dehydrogenation of propylene. The surface electronic structure and valence orbitals at the active metal site of Pt-based catalysts can be selectively tuned by Zn promoter [61]. The influence of Zn addition on the properties of a Pt/Mg(Zn)AlO x catalyst synthesized from layered hydroxides was studied [60]. The results indicated the formation of bimetallic Pt-Zn particles effectively reduced the Pt particle size and stabilized Pt in an active metallic state, which made this catalyst an excellent dehydrogenation performance. Another investigation focused attentions on the modification effect of Zn on a Pt supported on ZSM-5 catalyst [58]. Accordingly, the doping of Zn enhanced Pt species interaction with the support and effectively increased Pt dispersion through geometric effects introduced by Zn. Besides, the introduction of Zn apparently reduced the acidity of the zeolite support leading to less side reactions and higher selectivity toward propylene. Compared with non-Zn Pt-based catalyst, the synthesized PtZn/ZSM-5 catalysts exhibited higher catalytic performance. Furthermore, in our previous work, we designed a catalyst collaborated Zn with Pt on high silica HZSM-5 zeolite [55]. The doping of Zn led to the formation of two synergistic active centers: (i) Lewis acidic sites generated from framework Zn species and (ii) small-sized Pt-Zn particles. The electronic interaction and dispersion effect between Pt and Zn contributed to the high catalytic stability in PDH reaction. 3.2 In Analogically, In has also been developed as a promising promoter of Pt-based catalysts for PDH reaction [63–67]. Previously, Sun et al. prepared a high-performance PDH catalyst by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium (Mg(In)(Al)O) [68]. Pt-In bimetallic particles with an average diameter of 1 nm were synthesized after reduction in H2 at temperatures above 673 K. The alloying of In with Pt induced a significant decrease in the rate of coke accumulation during PDH process. A supported bimetallic alloy (Pt3In) catalyst with an high activity and propylene selectivity comparable to pure Pt3Sn was devised [66]. The In role was attributed to an apparently increasing electron transfer from In to Pt, which impacted the adsorption energies of propylene. A bimetallic Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst promoted by doping In for PDH reaction which exhibited a high propane conversion (>41.0 %) and propylene selectivity (>96 %) [69]. The existence of In not only maintained the intrinsic catalytic active and propylene selectivity, but also inhibits the coke formation during PDH process. Other studies have also been done upon the synthesis condition of Pt-In catalytic systems [70]. Shen et al. studied the influence on different calcination temperature of a Pt-In/Mg(Al)O catalyst [64]. It was indicated the calcination temperature of support had obvious effect on the surface acid sites of the prepared Pt-In/Mg(Al)O catalyst and the flake structure collapsed constantly with the increasing calcination temperature of supports, resulting in the change of the textural properties and the formation of more stable structure. Zhang et al. focused on the effects of reduction atmosphere on structure and catalytic performance of the Pt-In/Mg(Al)O/ZnO [63]. The optimal dehydrogenation performance and coke resistance ability in Pt-In bimetallic particles depended on the dispersion degree of Pt, In0/In3+ molar ratio, interaction between Pt and In, and Pt size, which were significantly influenced by the conducted reduction atmosphere. 3.3 Ga Gallium oxide (GaO x )-based catalysts have been studied for years and been proven as high-performance catalysts for PDH reaction [71–76]. Meantime, Ga is also an ideal promoter of Pt-based catalysts and have been applied in practical production [46,77-83]. In our previous work, we successfully encapsulated Pt-Ga nanoparticles into silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolites and obtained a high-performance Pt-Ga@S-1 catalyst for PDH reaction [84]. Ga could produce a strong electronic interaction with Pt demonstrated (Fig. 3(d) and (e)) while enhanced the dispersion. The addition of Ga could also introduce weak acid sites which could collaborate with Pt-Ga nanoclusters to achieve a better catalytic performance. Payard et al. combined DFT calculation and experimental data, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and TEM to refine the structure of silica-supported Pt-Ga nanoparticles and provided a structure−activity relationship at the molecular level [77]. The introduction of Ga had a positive effect on the selectivity and stability of the Pt-based catalyst. The presence of Ga enhances three key aspects of the catalyst: (i) the interaction between the oxide surface and nanoparticles, thereby reducing sintering of Pt; (ii) the isolation of Pt sites; and (iii) the mobility of surface atoms, consequently boosting the activity, selectivity, and stability. Jablonski et al. have studied the effect of Ga addition to Pt/Al2O3 focused on the changes of activity, selectivity and deactivation in PDH reaction [85]. The selectivity of propylene was enhanced due to the addition of Ga, while the catalyst deactivation and the carbon formation were inhibited by the Ga introduction. Besides, the addition of Ga had low impact on the acidity of catalysts, but modified the structure of the metallic phase differently depending on the reduction temperature. After low reduction temperature (573 K), the effect of Ga was only reflected in the geometric effect where the fraction of Ga could be either intercalated between Pt atoms or deposited in the periphery of the Pt, leading to high dispersion of Pt particles. When the reduction temperature rising up to high temperature (773 K), additional effects including Ga blocking and the electronic interaction between Pt and Ga would take place, improving the selectivity of Pt active sites. Zhang et al. studied the subsurface effect of Pt-Ga nanoparticles [83]. Theoretical simulation demonstrated that the subsurface regulation would increase the electron density of surface Pt species and thus weaken propylene adsorption. Effects have been made to further enhance the performance of the Pt-Ga catalyst. Srinath et al. deposited an Al2O3 coating, about 1 nm thickness, on two Pt-Ga catalysts (Pt-Ga/MgAl2O4 and Pt/MgGaAlO) for further enhancement of the PtGa-based catalyst [81]. The Al2O3 coating obviously restricted the sintering of surface PtGa nanoparticles, resulting in a stable catalytic performance. Lately, Nakaya et al. introduced Pb and Ca as double-promoters to decorate a PtGa/SiO2 catalyst [86]. This catalyst exhibited an excellent stability with no obvious catalytic deactivation in 20 days at 873 K with H2 cofeeding, attributing to the electronic transfer effect exerted by Ca doping and geometric compartmentation effect bringing by Pb introduction, as shown in Fig. 3(f), (g) and (h). 3.4 Other promoters In addition to the above-mentioned promoters, Cu, Fe, Mn, Co, Ni et al. also have been studied and applied to PDH reaction, making great progress in promoter exploitation [87–89]. Sun et al. reported a Pt-Cu single atom alloy (SAA) supported on γ-Al2O3 with a great improvement of propylene selectivity and a slight loss of intrinsic dehydrogenation activity for PDH reaction compared with sole Pt catalyst [90]. The single Pt atoms scattered around Cu particles significantly promoted the desorption of propylene and inhibited the deep dehydrogenation. DFT calculation showed that the Pt-Cu SAA exhibited a large energy barrier between the desorption energy and the deep dehydrogenation barrier of propylene and a reasonable dehydrogenation energy barrier for propane. T. Miller et al. prepared a series Pt-Co nanoparticles with different Co loading and tested their dehydrogenation performance [91]. All the Pt-Co nanoparticles exhibited a considerable propane conversion with a higher selectivity toward propylene than sole Pt and Co. The high catalytic performance resulted from the electron transfer from Co to Pt which filled the 5d orbitals of Pt and weakened the absorption of propylene and H2. Besides, Co severed as a structure promoter to reduce the ensembles of Pt, making Pt inactive to side reactions. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra (EXAFS) indicated that with the increasing of Co loading, the surface of Pt-Co nanoparticles changed from Pt3Co to Pt1Co1 while the core remained in a composition of Pt3Co. The propylene selectivity was influenced by the different core structures in different Co loading with H2 cofeeding, showing that a slight deceasing in selectivity happened with the Co increasing in the core. In other report, Fan et al. utilized Mn-decorated dendritic mesoporous silica as a quality support for Pt stabilization and dispersion [92]. It was found that the highly dispersed Pt-Mn particles promoted the catalytic performance significantly in both propylene and stability compared with monometallic Pt catalyst because of the peptization of Mn decoration and the strong electron transfer from Mn to Pt. In parallel to the above discussed promoters, Fe also has the potential to be promising promoter for Pt-based catalyst. C. Wegener et al. synthesized a series of Pt-Fe catalyst with different Fe loading [93]. The Fe introduction changed the electronic property of Pt and reduced the PtPt bonds, responsible for high catalytic performance. However, the presence of large amount of Fe species could induce the generation of coke sites (Fe(0) particles), severely ruining the catalytic durability. To solve this problem, in a latest report, Guo et al. optimized the Pt-Fe catalyst by the cofeeding of a soft oxidant, carbon dioxide [94]. With the CO2 cofeeding, the Fe(0) coke sites could be eliminated successfully without altering the Pt-Fe alloy. Pt alloying with rare-earth elements (REEs) via the conventional H2 reduction route is hindered by the low chemical potential of REE oxides. In a previous report, Pt−REE (Pt-Y, Pt-La) alloys dehydrogenation catalysts were synthesized utilizing silanol nests in a siliceous MFI zeolite [95]. The prepared Pt−REE catalysts demonstrated both a high initial conversion of propane, nearly reaching a thermodynamically limited level, and a prolonged catalytic lifetime. In conclusion, introducing metals to form PtM alloy and/or intermetallic compounds is a promising approach to improve the catalytic activity and enhance the selectivity to targeted propylene. As previously outlined, metal promoters, including transition metals (Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni), late transition metals (Sn, Ga), and rare-earth metals (Y, La), have been widely investigated. All these promoters are commonly recognized for their pivotal role in exerting geometric and electronic effects on Pt active components. On the one side, metal promoters separate the Pt assembles and inhibit the sintering of Pt sites during the reaction and regeneration processes. On the other side, the presence of promoters is capable in adjusting the electronic structure and d bands of Pt, regulating the adsorptive property toward substrate and product, influencing the reaction orientation, and thus improve the anti-coke ability. Gong et al. proposed a simple descriptor, degree-of-isolation, to evaluate the influence of various promoters and the catalytic behaviors of corresponding PtM alloys, both considering the electronic and geometric effects [96]. The PtZn alloy exhibits a moderate degree of isolation and thus is identified as the optimal catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, indicating the Zn as the most promising promoters. Besides, the cost analysis on the involved metal promoters further proves the superiority of Zn (1–10$/Kg). However, albeit with the merit, Zn suffers from the severe volatilization under the high reaction and generation temperature. Therefore, it is still urgent to explore new promoters and optimize the current the Pt-promoter catalytic systems. 4 Supports for Pt-based catalysts In heterogeneous catalytic systems, with the purpose of cost controlling and obtaining well dispersed active compounds, porous materials with excellent hydrothermal stability and high specific surface are usually utilized [97]. The physicochemical properties, including elementary composition, acidity and morphology, have a great impact on the stability and state of active compounds [98]. Generally, the exploitative supports for PDH reaction can be divided into two main sorts: oxide supports (Al2O3, SiO2, zeolites and so on) and non-oxide supports (carbide, nanocarbon materials and so on). In this section, we will comprehensively summarize the traditional and advanced supports for PDH reaction over Pt-based catalyst. Then, regulation approaches to enhance catalytic performance will be discussed. 4.1 Al2O3 Al2O3 has already been utilized in practical productions (FBD-4, UOP, Oleflex, STAR and FCDh) because of its excellent qualities including high surface area, hydrothermal stability, chemical stability, and mechanical stability [81,85,99-102]. A comparative investigation of Pt-Sn supported on different supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous Al2O3, SBA-15) was conducted [103]. The Pt-Sn supported on mesoporous Al2O3 catalyst displayed the highest catalytic performance due to the narrowly distributive and uniform Pt-Sn particles on the support surface. The strong interaction between mesoporous Al2O3 and Sn species significantly stabilized the oxidative Sn and the followed formation Pt-Sn particles leading to the excellent catalytic stability and propylene selectivity. Synthesizing Al2O3 supports with different physicochemical properties provides a novel approach to improve the PDH performance [104]. Previously, a novel Al2O3 support with pentacoordinate Al3+ ions was prepared as promising support for PDH reaction [105]. This γ-Al2O3 sheet with rich pentacoordinate Al3+ sites (∼27 %) provided an advantageous metal-support interaction to anchor and disperse Pt-Sn particles. The prepared Pt-Sn/ Al2O3 exhibited a high selectivity toward propylene (∼99 %) (Fig. 4 (a)) along with superior anti-sintering and anti-coke ability. Analogously, Zhu et al. developed a Pt-Sn/Al2O3 utilizing a mesoporous Al2O3 with this type of pentacoordinate Al3+ sites [106]. Nevertheless, this mesoporous Al2O3 possessed more abundant coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ centers (50.8 %) that could nicely disperse and stabilize Pt species by forming AlOPt bonds. Owing to the strong interaction between Pt species and Al3+penta sites, this catalyst exhibited outstanding catalytic stability with propylene selectivity above 98 % and no obvious sintering of Pt-Sn particles. Introducing a certain amount of another metal oxide (TiO2, CeO2 and so on) can operatively improve the catalytic performance of Al2O3. For instance, Gong et al. employed CeO2-Al2O3 binary oxide for the supporting of Pt-Ga particle [78]. The presence of CeO2 significantly enhanced the catalytic stability on account of the anti-coke capability of this CeO2-Al2O3 binary oxide. In another report, Guo et al. compared the PDH performance of Pt-Sn-In particles supported on Al2O3, ZrO2 and ZrO2-doped Al2O3 [107]. The Pt-Sn-In/ZrO2-Al2O3 catalyst displayed superior catalytic performance (Fig. 4(b)), achieving a propane conversion of 55 %, propylene selectivity of 98 %, and remarkable reproducibility across five reaction–regeneration cycles, attributed to the unique textural characteristics and favorable surface acidity of ZrO2-doped Al2O3. Generally acknowledged, the strong acidity of Al2O3 can induce CC cracking, polymerization and further coke formation, accelerating the deactivation of PDH catalyst. The introduction of alkaline and alkaline earth metal can be an effective method to weaken the acidity of Al2O3. Rimaz et al. used CaO as promoter to enhance the catalytic performance of a Pt-Ge/Al2O3 catalyst [100]. After the introduction of Ca, the Pt-Ge-Ca/Al2O3 exhibited an improved propylene selectivity (from 96.4 % to 98.5 %) with a reduced deactivation function (from 0.22−1 to 0.05−1). This enhanced catalytic performance originated from the decrease of the acid centers in the Al2O3 support demonstrated by NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) (Fig. 4(c)) which successfully inhibited the deactivation induced by coke deposition. However, the introduction of metal oxide may strengthen the acidity of Al2O3 support, ruining the catalytic performance of Al2O3 support to some extent. Gong et al. added TiO2 into Al2O3 support and utilized this binary oxide as support for Pt particles [108]. The addition of proper amount of TiO2 (10 %) can effectively improve the catalytic selectivity and stability on account of the electron transfer from the partially reduced TiO x species to Pt. However, the introduction of TiO2 could also increase the amount of the strong acid centers of the Al2O3 support. Thus, the excessive addition of TiO2 (20 %) would ruin the catalytic performance due to the increasing of side reactions and coke accumulation. 4.2 SiO2 SiO2 is a promising alternative support for Pt-based catalyst in PDH reaction. SiO2 supports possess considerable qualifies, including hydrothermal stability, chemical stability, mechanical stability and weak acidity [109]. For instance, Nakaya et al. supported single-atom Pt intermetallic on a mesoporous SiO2 support which exhibited high propylene conversion and selectivity with no obvious deactivation after 96 h PDH reaction [110]. The interaction between SiO2 and metal (Pt and other promoters M) species is usually weak, which makes it an easy process to form Pt-M alloys and/or intermetallics, effectively saving the electric energy and hydrogen gas potential. On the contrary, the weak metal-support interaction can also result in a Pt-based catalyst with low catalytic stability due to the easy sintering of Pt nanoparticles into big ones during both the reaction and the regeneration processes. Thus, for the sake of the redispersion of Pt active sites, halogens are usually needed in the regeneration process. A previous report has investigated the metal-support interaction between Pt and some oxide supports (SiO2, TiO2, CeO2) [111]. It is indicated that during the reduction process to form metallic Pt sites, TiO2 and CeO2 could provide stronger metal-support interactions than SiO2. To solve this problem, Miller et al. introduced Nb (or Ti) species in and successfully synthesized Pt-Nb (or Pt-Ti)/SiO2 catalyst where the supported Pt particles were partially covered by NbO x (or TiO x ) species [112]. Compared with the Pt/SiO2 catalyst, higher propylene selectivity and catalytic durability were achieved because of the strong metal-support interaction induced by the Nb (or Ti) species introduction albeit with a slight decrease in catalytic activity. This metal-support interaction may only derive from the physical coverage effect of oxide layers because no obvious change in the energy of Pt valence orbitals was observed, which indicated that these oxide layers had little electronic effect with Pt active sites. Wang et al. fabricated a SiO2 nanomesh with ultrashort 3D channels to support metal active sites [113]. The strong metal-support interaction was achieved by the presence of abundant oxygen defects in the channel wall generated in the process of soft template removal under an air atmosphere. These oxygen (O*) defects provided a microenvironment to stabilize metal active sites by forming MO bonds, drastically improving the chemical properties of SiO2 support. 4.3 Zeolites Microporous zeolites employed in many catalytic fields is a type of aluminosilicate with uniform pore structure, well-ordered channels, high surface area, hydrothermal stability and controllable acidity, considered as a promising support for PDH reaction [117–121]. MFI-type, SAPO-type and BEA-type zeolites have already been explored in PDH reaction for the supporting of Pt particles [122]. A Pt-Sn-based catalyst was synthesized utilizing a SAPO-type zeolite, SAPO-34 [123]. The prepared Pt-Sn/SAPO-34 catalyst exhibited a high selectivity toward propylene (∼94 %) on account of the suitable acidity after the metal doping. Wei et al. investigated the influence of reaction and calcination temperature of a Pt-Sn/SAPO-34 catalyst [124]. They found that the Pt-Sn/SAPO-34 catalyst presented a considerable dehydrogenation activity with a fine catalytic stability at the reaction temperature of 868 K and calcination temperature of 773 K because under these temperatures, the Pt-Sn particles could maintain their surface metallic properties. Likely, Pt-Zn supported on H-ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst was designed and obtained high dehydrogenation activity with enhanced propylene selectivity [55]. In another report, lee et al. supported Pt-Sn particles on different supports (Beta zeolite, θ-Al2O3 and amorphous SiO2) and comprehensively investigated their catalytic performance [125]. It was revealed that Pt-Sn/beta presented the highest propylene selectivity compared with Pt-Sn/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/SiO2, showing advantages as an outstanding support. The Lewis acid sites are recognized as selectively active sites for the dehydrogenation of propane while the Brønsted acid sites are usually identified as nocuous sites activating various side reactions [126]. Generally, zeolites are a sort of aluminosilicate consisting of Al, Si and O elements. To balance the negative charge between [AlO4] and [SiO4], protons are usually required, which causes the generation of the strong Brønsted acid sites [127–129]. Dealumination treatment is an effective approach to eliminate the influence of the Brønsted acid on zeolite support. An efficient Pt-Sn/BEA catalyst was synthesized using the dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite as support, as shown in Fig. 4(d) [114]. The dealumination treatment not only reduced the Brønsted acid sites of Beta zeolite but also provided unique defective silanol groups which provided an opportunity to fix active compounds on the vacant T sites. This Pt-Sn/SiBeta catalyst demonstrated high propane formation rate with excellent selectivity toward propylene (∼99 %). All-siliceous zeolite is a promising support with an appropriate acidity but provides a relatively weak metal-support interaction. Wang et al. successfully encapsulated Pt-Zn nanoparticles in the synthesis process of S-1 zeolite via a one-pot synthesis method, as shown in Fig. 4(e) [115]. This prepared Pt-Zn@S-1 catalyst exhibited a 45.3 % propane conversion and a > 99 % propylene selectivity under reaction temperature of 823 K on account of the confined effect imposed by S-1 zeolite to the ultra-small Pt-Zn particles. Mesoporous zeolite is an alternative of traditional microporous zeolite in PDH application, showing advantage in diffusion efficiency and enhancing the catalyst lifetime and stability. SBA-15 zeolite was synthesized for the preparation of a Pt-Ga/SBA-15 [82]. The prepared Pt-Ga/SBA-15 catalyst achieved a high initial propane conversion (∼60 %) with a high initial selectivity toward propylene (98.2 %) under 823 K and still maintained 51.6 % propane conversion with 99.5 % propylene selectivity after 25 h PDH reaction. The coke deposition was studied via temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). A large amount of coke tended to deposit on the surface of support indicating this SBA-15 possessed anti-coke ability. However, channels of mesoporous zeolite are usually amorphous, causing a poor hydrothermal stability and weak metal-support interaction for stabilization Pt particles. The weak metal-zeolite interaction can be alleviated by the utilization of the silanol nests on zeolite surface and novel encapsulation methods. To address the inherent flaws of mesoporous zeolites, the solution necessitates resorting to a new synthetic process to create mesoporous materials with a high degree of crystallinity. There is still a long way to go for the applying mesoporous zeolite in industrial propylene production. 4.4 Carbon materials Carbon materials with high acid/base stability, surface area, and chemical inertness have been applied in many heterogeneous catalytic fields and also exhibited a good potential as support for PDH reaction [130,131]. Pt particles supported on nanocarbon composed of a defective, ultrathin graphene shell and nanodiamond core (ND@G) catalyst was prepared and tested in PDH reaction [132]. This Pt/ND@G catalyst exhibited outstanding catalytic stability that only slight deactivation was observed after 100 h reaction on account of anti-sintering ability bring by the strong interaction between Pt and this carbon material though relative low propane conversion (∼16 %) with 88 % propylene selectivity was perceived. Defective carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were also prepared to support Pt for PDH reaction [133]. Defective sites were introduced on the sp2 bonded carbon network during the acid treatment on raw carbon nanotubes using a mixed solution of sulfuric acid and nitric acid. The prepared Pt/CNTs-RD catalyst showed a higher catalytic performance and stability compare the Pt/CNTs. The defective sites on the CNTs provided a strong metal-support interaction resulting in the strong anti-sintering and anti-coking abilities. Doping heteroatoms in carbon material is an effective approach to modulate the physicochemical properties. For instance, single sites Pt atoms on supported on boron- and nitrogen-doped graphene catalysts were investigated via first principles calculations [134]. Different electronic effects were detected on the N-doped and B-doped graphene. The B heteroatoms donated electrons to Pt and shifted the Pt d-band center close to the Fermi Level while the N heteroatoms withdrew electrons from Pt. The N-doped graphene was predicted as the more effective support for enhancing the catalytic of Pt. Recently, Copéret et al. developed a methodology to generate Pt and PtGa nanoparticles with tailored interfaces on carbon supports by combining surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) (Fig. 4(f)) [116]. The prepared PtGa/C catalyst exhibited high catalytic performance and stability. The carbon materials are recognized as one type support with many merits, such as low cost, environmental friendliness, and wide resources, and abundant porous structure. Although the carbon materials have shown promising qualities as supports for Pt catalysts, the regeneration process of the carbon materials is still a big problem because the oxidizing removal of coke and redispersion of Pt usually are conducted at high temperature under air atmosphere, which may destroy the structure of carbon materials. Thus, the research on the improvement of single-cycle stability should be paid more attention. 5 Conclusions and outlook Propylene, an important chemical feedstock, still has a rising industrial demand for the foreseen future. The traditional propylene production based on petroleum industry is severely challenged by the soaring oil prices and becomes increasingly incapable to fill this deficiency of propylene production capacity. The rapidly increasing propane reserve with the exploitation of affluent shale gas resource makes the technique of propylene production via direct dehydrogenation of propane. The plants of industrial propylene production through PDH technique have been spring up due to the big price spread between propylene and propane (price gap ∼210 USD/mt) [135,136]. Metallic Pt-based catalyst has drawn much attention and functioned in the UOP Oleflex technique owing to its excellent C–H activation ability. Monometallic Pt catalyst usually exhibits a disappointing catalytic performance, low propylene selectivity and stability, in PDH reaction, suffering from rapid activity shrinkage due to the sintering of active Pt sites and coke deposition under the high reaction temperature. Most commonly, the solution comes to be introducing an extra metal (M) to form P-M alloy or intermetallic for the purpose of modulate the Pt sites. Till now, many post-transition metals (Ga, In, Sn and Pb) and transition metals (Fe, Co, Cu, V and Zn) have been explored and recognized as excellent promoters for Pt-based catalyst. The reasonable introduction of these metallic promoters into Pt-based catalyst has made a great success in significantly improving the catalytic activity, selectivity to propylene, anti-coke ability and anti-sintering ability, which provides a great opportunity to the large-scale application of Pt catalyst in industrial production. The impact bringing by promoters can be boiled down to the geometric and electronic effects, including but not limited to (i) there is an electron transfer from promoter metal to Pt leading to the downshift of the Pt d-band center and an easy desorption of propylene, (ii) promoters can serve as separators to reduce the PtPt ensembles on catalyst surface, elevating the selectivity toward propylene. Till now, despite many metallic promoters have been explored and made success to some extent, the exact active structures are still under debate and need further researching. As a matter of fact, excessive promoters are usually added in practical operation leading to a certain amount of waste. For instance, a large amount of Sn is usually required because the Pt-Sn nanoparticles could dealloying and separate in to metallic Pt and SnO x species during the PDH process when the Sn is relatively low. Thus, there are still a lot of work to do for the improvement of Pt-based catalyst. In these heterogeneous catalytic systems, the selection of supports whose morphology, phase, porosity, surface acidity property, and surface area determine the interaction with Pt active species is significantly meaningful. Several materials suitable for PDH catalyst are summarized, including traditional oxides, zeolites and new-fashioned carbon materials. Traditional oxide, Al2O3 and SiO2, have been proven as excellent PDH supports with plenty of characters including but not limited to high surface area and hydrothermal stability for obtaining high dispersed Pt nanoparticles. The existence of strong acid sites on Al2O3 identified as reactive sites for cracking reaction and other undesirable side reaction may damage the catalyst performance, reducing the production selectivity and shortening the catalyst life time. Doping alkaline metal elements (Na, K) or alkaline earth elements (Mg, Ga) is an effective approach to balance the support acidity. It is worth noting that the introduction of these metal elements can not only help to achieve a favorable surface acidity but also exert electronic effect to Pt sites. Besides, introducing another appropriate oxide into to form an oxide mixture provides an alternative route for surface acidity modulation while adding unmerited oxide may create more strong acid sites, further ruining the catalytic performance. SiO2, processing analogous properties as Al2O3 is a promising alternative support, providing a catalytic micro-environment of proper acidity causing that SiO2-based catalyst usually possesses a higher propylene selectivity than Al2O3-based catalyst. Nonetheless, the SiO2 supports have their own drawback that a relatively weak metal-support interaction is usually established. Methods to modify the structure-property of Pt/SiO2 catalyst for the enhancement the interaction between Pt nanoparticles and SiO2 support are proposed including mixed oxide method, extra-layer method and so on. With regard of zeolite support, it is identified as a state-of-art material in many catalytic fields due to the well-ordered and controllable pore structure. Besides, there is a strong confinement effect, structural and/or electronic, exposed by the zeolite framework and strong electrostatic field in the molecular-scale space of zeolites to stabilize the active compounds. The Brønsted acid sites generated from the extra-framework protons for the balance of the electronegativity gap between the framework Al atoms and Si atoms are stimulators for the side reactions. Dealumination treatment of zeolite or selecting full-silicon zeolite are effective approaches to solve this problem. Carbon materials are a sort of novel supports for the PDH reaction in a one-pass reaction mode because the regeneration of carbon-based PDH catalyst is still a big problem. However, the design notion of Pt/C catalyst provides a novel perspective to synthesize high-performance PDH support, such as defects engineering, heteroatomic doping and so on. Albeit with the propane dehydrogenation technique over Pt-based catalyst is a relative mature craft, problems still exist and deep research on issues including nature of active phases, understanding of the structure-activity relationship, dehydrogenation path, the ultra-using of promoters, coke formation mechanism and so on, over Pt-based catalyst are still needed. Operando/in-situ characterization techniques, such as in-situ X-ray absorption spectrum, in-situ X-ray powder diffraction, in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectrum, and in-situ transmission electron microscopy, are effective approaches to reveal the active sites and reaction mechanisms under dehydrogenation reaction conditions. The DFT theoretical calculation is considered a powerful tool for predicting and investigating the reaction energy barriers, reaction intermediates, and electronic states. However, in computational studies, the structure of active sites on catalysts is typically represented by simple low-index surfaces. A disparity remains between realistic catalysts operating under reaction conditions and these model surfaces. Microkinetic analysis of reactions is essential for accurately representing experimental conditions and comprehending critical industrial reactions. The integration of DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling with multiscale modeling at the catalyst pellet and reactor levels, as well as experimental studies, is crucial for discovering new catalysts and enhancing industrial catalysts. In conclusion, we have provided a comprehensive summary on the Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction, highlighting on the catalytic mechanisms, utilized promoters and supports, approaches to improve the catalytic performance, and current challenges. We hope this review can provide a more scientific guidance on fundamentally optimizing Pt-based catalysts design.

        "dc:description": "Heterogeneous catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene (PDH) has been considered an efficient technique in the olefins supply chains. Metallic Pt is recognized as a promising catalyst for PDH reaction on account of its excellent affinity to CH bonds and CH activation ability. However, monometallic Pt catalysts usually exhibit an unsatisfactory performance (poor selectivity toward propylene and low catalytic stability), which is attributed to the severe sintering of Pt particles and the coke formation during the dehydrogenation process. Various metal promoters (M) are ingeniously introduced into Pt-based catalysts functioning via the formation of Pt-M alloys and/or intermetallics. Besides, several supports suitable for Pt-based catalysts have been probed to achieve high Pt dispersion and strong metal-support interaction. In this review, we precede the introduction of promoters and supports applied in Pt-based catalysts with an overview of PDH reaction mechanism. The specific roles of the promoter addition along with the advantages and drawbacks of state-of-art supports are significantly highlighted. Current challenges and prospects for the future development of Pt-based catalysts are also discussed.",
