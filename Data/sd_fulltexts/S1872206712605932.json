This is in recognition of his outstanding contributions to surface chemisâ€� try and heterogeneous catalysis. Professor Deng was born in Shanghai in August 1933. After graduating from the Department of Chemistry, Fudan Univerâ€� sity in 1955, he majored in electrochemistry under the superviâ€� sion of Professor Haoqing Wu and then began his teaching caâ€� reer in Fudan in 1959. Professor Deng worked diligently in teaching and research for over 40 years. In the 1970s, based on his industrial experiâ€� ence, Professor Deng developed an electrolytic silver catalyst. Since then, the production of formaldehyde in China has achieved international levels, and the catalyst has been adopted by a large number of factories throughout the country. In the early 1980s, Professor Deng designed an ultraâ€�high vacuum system and started research on solid catalysis from the perâ€� spective of vacuum surface chemistry. In the midâ€�1980s, he took the lead in catalysis research in amorphous synthesis, laying solid foundations for the application of amorphous alloy catalysts in industrial manufacturing. Professor Deng was diliâ€� gent in publishing and teaching, mentoring a considerable number of students who are now active in teaching and reâ€� search. He made prominent contributions to basic research on metal catalysis and new catalytic materials, and raised the Chiâ€� nese level of research in this field to the same level as those in advanced countries worldâ€�wide. Professor Deng won numerous honors and awards, includâ€� ing a national award for innovation, five provincial awards, seven awards for teaching and research publication, and the titles â€œNationwide Model Worker in the Education Sectorâ€�, â€œTeacher of the Peopleâ€�, and â€œNationwide Advanced Worker in the Sectors of Science and Technologyâ€�. He was elected a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1995. Professor Deng had a number of academic positions and acâ€� tively promoted academic activities and exchanges. He was a member of the eighth, ninth, and tenth standing committees of Chemistry Section, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chief of the reviewing panel for physical chemistry for the sixth and seventh National Natural Science Foundation of China, Deputy Chief of the physical chemistry section of the second National Steering Committee for the Teaching of Chemistry, Director of the academic committee of the State Key Laboratory of Coal Conversion, Deputy Director of the academic committee of the State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipality Center for New Materials Research, and a member of the Editorial Board for several chemistry journals. He also initiated a crossâ€�straits conference on catalysis and promoted academic exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. â€œConducting research with oneâ€™s own lifeâ€� is the advice Proâ€� fessor Deng gave to his graduate students. He certainly put these words into practice in his own life and made memorable contributions to education and scientific research in China. Professor Deng passed away 12 years ago. This year marks the 80th anniversary of his birth. This special issue in memory of Mr. Deng and his spirit of â€œconducting research with oneâ€™s own lifeâ€� includes 24 invited articles contributed by his former graduate students, collaborators, colleagues, and friends. These articles reflect his interests and fields of research and demonâ€� strate the recent progresses made in surface chemistry and solid catalysis. We express our sincere thanks for the hard work and warm support of the authors, reviewers, and editoriâ€� al office staff of the Chinese Journal of Catalysis.
