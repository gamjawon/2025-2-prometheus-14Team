Such grafted ionic liquids (GILs), which were verified by means of FTIR, element analysis, 29Si MAS NMR and N2 adsorption–desorption could be used as highly effective heterogeneous catalysts toward propylene carbonate synthesis through cycloaddition of CO2 with propylene oxide under solventless and mild conditions. Keywords Graft Ionic liquid Bond type Cycloaddition Carbon dioxide 1 Introduction Propylene carbonate (PC) has draw much attention recently, since it could be used as electrolytic element of lithium secondary batteries, polar aprotic solvent, intermediates for organic and polymeric synthesis, and ingredients for pharmaceutical/fine chemicals in biomedical applications [1]. One of its effective synthesis routes is the cycloaddition of CO2 with propylene oxide (PO). With the development of chemical technology causing minimum environmental impact [2], some “green” homogeneous catalysts have been adopted in the alternative route. The cycloaddition of CO2 has been reported over “green” ionic liquids such as 1-butyl-3-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate [3], 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [4] and pyridinium or ammonium salt [5,6]. High catalytic performance was achieved over these catalysts. Unfortunately, the reaction was carried out in homogeneous catalytic systems with the drawbacks of poor catalyst recovery and product separation. Hence, there was a crucial need to exploit more highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts. Grafted ionic liquids (GILs), which were prepared by fixing ionic liquids onto solid supports, kept important physical and chemical features of ionic liquids, such as nonvolatility, nonflammability and thermal stability as well as catalytic activity and selectivity. Therefore, they were considered as promising catalysts in many catalytic reactions. For the cycloaddition of CO2, some GILs exhibited high catalytic performance [1,7]. However, there are few reports focusing on nonmetal GILs and their application. Moreover, since nonmetal basic ionic liquid [bmim]OH was regarded as an effective catalyst in Michael addition, Markovnikov addition, aldol condensation and three-component condensation with advantages of good nucleophilicity and stability, it had aroused great academic interest [8–12]. Thus, in the present work, a series of grafted ionic liquids were prepared from nonmetal ionic liquid 1-(triethoxysilyl)propyl-3-methylimidazolium hydroxide ([Smim]OH) and used as catalysts for the cycloaddition of PO with CO2. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalysts preparation Chromatography silica gel (ZCX-2) was purchased from Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co., Ltd. Other solvents and reagents were commercial analytic without further purification. 2.1.1 Preparation of ionic liquids ([Smim]Cl, [Smim]BF4 and [Smim]OH) The ionic liquid hydroxide [Smim]OH was synthesized from 1-(triethoxysilyl) propyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Smim]Cl) [1,13,14]. Typically, a 100ml toluene solution containing methylimidazolium and triethoxysilyl propyl chloride was refluxed until it stratified. And the resulting [Smim]Cl was extracted by ethyl acetate and dried in vacuum for 12h. Then, solid sodium hydroxide (40mmol) was added to the solution of [Smim]Cl (40mmol) in dry methylene chloride, and the mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 10h. After that, the precipitated NaCl was separated by filtration, and the methylene chloride was evaporated to form the crude [Smim]OH as a viscous liquid. Finally, [Smim]OH sample was obtained by washing with ether (3×20ml) and dried at 363K for 10h. The ionic liquid [Smim]BF4 was synthesized from [Smim]Cl [15]. In brief, [Smim][Cl] was transferred to a plastic container followed by the addition of aqueous HBF4 (40%) at a 1.1:1M ratio. [Smim]BF4 was separated from the HCl by extraction into a volume of methylene chloride approximately equal to the initial amount of [Smim][Cl]. Then the organic phase was separated by a separatory funnel. After that the methylene chloride was evaporated to form the crude [Smim]BF4. 2.1.2 Preparation of grafted ionic liquids [Smim]OH/SiO2 and [Smim]BF4/SiO2 (GILsx x=1, 2, 3) Grafted ionic liquids (GILs) were prepared using the method proposed by the literature [16]. As shown in Scheme 1 , a mixture of [Smim]OH and silica gel (pretreated at 573K for 6h) in toluene (100ml) was refluxed for 16h at 363K. After being fully stirred, volatile components of the mixture were removed by a rotary evaporator. By changing the relative amounts of the two materials, GILs with different ionic liquid and silica gel molar ratios were prepared. Then resulting materials were dried in vacuum at 353K for 12h. Finally, yellow powders were obtained and denoted as GIL1, GIL2 and GIL3 corresponding to 5%, 10% and 15% of molar ratio, respectively. The method of [Smim]BF4/SiO2 synthesis was similar to that of [Smim]OH/SiO2. 2.2 Catalyst characterization Elemental analysis was performed by using a Vario EL analyzer. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy results of the samples were recorded using self-supported wafers on a NICOLET NEXUS 470 FTIR spectrophotometer with 4cm−1 resolution. In advance, the samples should be dried at 373K for 3h, and then they were pressed into 13mm discs. The solid-state 29Si NMR experiments using magic angle spinning (MAS) were conducted on a AVANCE III 400 Bruker spectrometer. The resonance frequency was 5kHz in 4mm diameter ZrO2 rotors. Tm (m =0–3) and Q n (n =0–4) notations had their well known usual meaning [17]. T and Q were corresponding to the oxo trifunctional R-SiO3 and tetrafunctional SiO4 central units, respectively. Both m and n were the numbers of Si–O–Si bridging oxygens attached to the central unit [18]. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were obtained at liquid nitrogen temperature on a Micromeritics ASAP-2000 instrument (Norcross, GA), using static adsorption procedures. Prior to measurement, samples were degassed at 353K overnight under 10−4 Pa. Surface area (S BET) was measured using the BET method. 2.3 Catalytic test The cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxide was carried out in an 80ml stainless steel autoclave equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Before the reaction, the catalyst was dried at 373K for 3h. In a typical reaction process, the PO and catalyst were poured into the reactor. Then 2.0MPa CO2 was added to the mixture of PO (70mmol) and the catalyst ([Smim]OH/SiO2 1.17mmol%) in an autoclave. Then, the reactor was heated to 393K and kept for 4h. After the reaction, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature and the excess of carbon dioxide was vented slowly. The liquid product was separated by centrifugation from the reaction mixture and was analyzed using a GC-950 gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector and a packed column (GDX-203). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural characterization FTIR spectra of hydroxyl ionic liquid GIL1, GIL2 and GIL3 were showed in Fig. 1 . The absorbance in the region 3000–2800cm−1 was due to aliphatic C–H stretching vibration [19–21], and the bands of imidazolium ring symmetrical stretching vibration could be found at 1570 and 1455cm−1. Besides, the absorbance at 1427cm−1 could be assigned to methylic C–H bending vibration [20,21]. All these results suggested the existence of ILs on the surface of silica gel. The content of element nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen in samples was listed in Table 1 . Considering that only [Smim]OH contained N element, the weight percent of [Smim]OH could be obtained according to that of N. Obviously, no N and C element was found in the silica gel, and then the two elements in grafted samples only came from ionic liquids. Thus, C/N molar ratios could be regarded as a standard whether the homogeneous complex was successfully grafted on the support [22]. In theory, when the C/N molar ratios of GILs [Smim]OH/SiO2 reached 5.5, 4.5 and 3.5, the covalent bond types between ionic liquids and silica gel could exist as one or two and even all three ethoxyls of ionic liquids interacted with one silanol group of silica gel via covalent bonds. Accordingly, the silicon atom environments in GILs were as the same as that in R–CH2–Si(OCH2CH3)2(OSi), R–CH2–Si(OCH2CH3)(OSi)2 and R–CH2–Si(OSi)3. Considering that actual C/N molar ratios of GIL1, GIL2 and GIL3 were all in the region 3.5–4.5 (see Table 1), it could be concluded that the bond types in three samples belonged to the mixture of two ethoxyls and three ethoxyls with silanol group by covalent bonds, which revealed that [Smim]OH was grafted on silica gel by two or three covalent bonds. In addition, the molar ratios between [Smim]OH and silica gel were 0.037:1, 0.066:1 and 0.10:1, which were equivalent to 0.55mmol, 0.90mmol and 1.3mmol of imidazolium salt per gram of catalysts. Thus, the FTIR spectra and elemental analysis results undoubtedly indicated that the active component [Smim]OH was successfully grafted on the support of silica gel. 29Si MAS NMR spectra could provide information about both the silicon environment and the degree of ionic liquid grafted on the silica gel. The 29Si MAS NMR spectra of the samples tested were depicted in Fig. 2 . Table 2 summarized the observed resonances in 29Si MAS NMR spectra and the corresponding relative peak areas. Therein, T 2 and T 3 represented the silicon atom environments of R–CH2–Si(OCH2CH3)(OSi)2 and R–CH2–Si(OSi)3, respectively [23,24]. And these agreed with the results of the elemental analysis. According to the percent content of T 2 + T 3 peaks in total 29Si NMR peaks, ionic liquids grafted degrees were found to be 23.9% for GIL1, 10.5% for GIL2 and 33.0% for GIL3, respectively. These three ratios suggested that the ionic liquid grafted on silica gel was realized as expected, which accorded with the FTIR and elemental analysis results. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of samples displayed type IV isotherms with clear hysteresis loops associated with capillary condensation. This indicated that the materials remained mesoporous before and after the graft, but the BET surface area and pore volume decreased due to the presence of grafted groups (Table 1). 3.2 Catalytic performance of grafted basic ionic liquids The cycloaddition reaction of CO2 with PO was carried out without any solvents. The typical results of the different catalysts were listed in Table 3 . Pure silica gel was inactive (entry 1) and all other catalysts presented 100% selectivity towards PC. It was found that [Smim]OH displayed high activity for PC synthesis (entry 2). Notably, GILs showed the same high catalytic activity as [Smim]OH, and even higher than KI, a traditional homogeneous catalyst for PC synthesis in industrial applications (entries 2–6). In addition, the ionic liquid concentration of GILs presented an influence on the catalytic perform, and GIL3 had the highest catalytic activity. It should be mentioned that the activity decreased in the order of BF 4 - >Br− >Cl− for this reaction in previous literatures [1,3,25,26]. More important, [Smim][OH]/SiO2 exhibited better performance than [Smim]BF4/SiO2 in the present work (entry 7). It was consider that the role of OH− might be as that of halide anions reported elsewhere, in which, the latter could activate PO via nucleophilic attack its β-carbon atom [5,7]. And the OH− might have a stronger nucleophilicity compared to halide anions. Furthermore, GIL1 could be used five times with little loss of activity (entry 9). As shown in Fig. 1, FTIR spectra of GIL1 after using five times were similar to that of fresh GIL1. Thus, it could be concluded that this catalyst did not change after it was used five times and the catalytic reaction was heterogeneous. Under the optimal conditions, the PO conversion could reach 97% over GIL1 (entry 8). 4 Conclusions The grafted ionic liquids [Smim]OH/SiO2 were synthesized by the covalent bond of [Smim]OH with silica gel, and the bond types for grafted ionic liquids were mixture of two ethoxyls and three ethoxyls with silanol group by covalent bonds, which revealed that [Smim]OH was grafted on silica gel by two or three covalent bonds. Such grafted ionic liquids possessed good thermal stability and mesoporous structure. In addition, the GILs exhibited high catalytic performance for cycladdition of CO2 under mild conditions without any additional solvent.

Such grafted ionic liquids (GILs), which were verified by means of FTIR, element analysis, 29Si MAS NMR and N2 adsorption–desorption could be used as highly effective heterogeneous catalysts toward propylene carbonate synthesis through cycloaddition of CO2 with propylene oxide under solventless and mild conditions.",
