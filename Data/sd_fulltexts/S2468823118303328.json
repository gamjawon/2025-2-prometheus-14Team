Graphical abstract There are the imperious demands for novel oxygen (O2) sensors in cutting-edge biochemical technologies and industrial hygiene. Here, we develop a colorimetric O2 sensor based on a spherical nano-sized reduced TiO2 (TiO2 – x ) catalyst, which resolves the critical bottlenecks of conventional systems. The sensing mechanism of our O2 sensors relies on two characteristics which are proven by simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. First, nano-TiO2– x , in the partially reduced form, shows a rapid, reversible O2 uptake at room temperature. Second, the partially reduced form of nano-TiO2– x , called black TiO2, shows a change in the lightness of color. Owing to these characteristics, the developed sensor it is well-suited for use at ambient temperature/pressure in the absence of a reference gas, in contrast with the conventional system. Also, it allows long-term operations and it can withstand degradation because the former comprises solid-state inorganic compounds. Keywords Colorimetric O2 sensor DFT calculations Three-phase reaction O2 re-uptake in black TiO2 1 Introduction Measurement and control of oxygen content are critical to numerous fields, e.g., industrial hygiene, environmental science, transportation, and agriculture [1]. Moreover, cutting-edge biochemical technologies such as cell biology, drug discovery, biotechnology, and biomedicine require the development of novel oxygen (O2) sensors [2,3], because O2 is a principal metabolite that rapidly diffuses across cell membranes, tissues, and biological fluids [3–5]. However, the abovementioned demands cannot be met by conventional O2 sensing techniques, because they suffer from critical drawbacks such as a logarithmic response to O2 concentration changes, the need of a reference gas [6,7], and operation at extremely high temperatures (∼300 °C), which is not suitable for novel biotechnological applications [8,9]. Although the above problems can be mitigated by utilizing luminescence-based O2 sensors, this technology requires the use of organic dyes for luminescence quenching. The organic dyes have a relatively short luminescence decay time and exhibit heterogeneous luminescence and quenching properties, which results in complex analytical dependences [10–12]. Here, we present density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental proof for the construction of a novel solid-state colorimetric O2 sensor based on nano-sized titania (TiO2) catalysts. It makes use of the fact that nanostructured TiO2– x , in the partially reduced form, is capable of rapid and reversible O2 uptake at room temperature [13], accompanied by lightness color changes (black TiO2) [14]. Compared to conventional O2 sensors, the developed system can be operated at ambient temperature/pressure and allows miniaturization and contactless measurements through a transparent window. Compared to O2 sensors based on organic-dye luminescence systems, the sensor uses inorganic nano-TiO2, which is chemically and physically stable, relatively inexpensive, and allows long-term operation [15]. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of the colorimetric O2 sensor Nano-TiO2 dispersion solution was prepared by mixing 0.7 g of the nano-TiO2 powder (Evonik Industries) with 25 mL of 2-propanol (Aldrich). The dispersion solution was spray-coated onto the carbon fabric (thickness ≈ 0.23 mm, CeTeck Co., Ltd.), and dried at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, resulting in a 100-μm-thick nano-TiO2 layer. A poly(vinyl alcohol) gel-like polymer electrolyte permeated with phosphoric acid (PVA/H3PO4 GPE) was prepared as described in our previous reports [16–18]. Here, 5 g of PVA powder (Aldrich) was dispersed in 40 mL of water with sufficient stirring, and 2.4 mL of 85 wt% H3PO4 (Samchun) was then added to the dispersion. The sample was stirred and heated at 75 °C until it became a transparent gel. Then, the PVA/H3PO4 GPE solution was drop-coated on the Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass (10 Ω/square, MTI Korea). At 30 °C, PVA/H3PO4 needs 8 h to solidify into a thin film of thickness ∼400 μm. The nano-TiO2 layer on the carbon fabric was brought into contact with the GPE on the ITO-coated glass under certain pressure, and a transparent porous plastic clip was used to hold the electrodes for firm bonding. Air transfer was facilitated by the presence of pores in the plastic clip. 2.2 Characterization of sensor structure The structure and morphology of the sensing electrode were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), respectively. High-angle XRD analysis was performed employing the D8 Discover Diffraction System with GADDS (Bruker AXS) operating at 50 kV and 100 mA with Cu Kα radiation (1.5406 Å). Pt-coated samples were subjected to FE-SEM imaging using a ZEISS Ultra Plus microscope operating at 2 kV in the secondary electron detection mode. 2.3 Electrochemical analysis and sensing measurements A transparent gas chamber, equipped with O2 and N2 mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst) and electrochemical workstation (ZIVE sp2, ZIVE LAB), was used for the electrochemical analysis and O2 sensing measurements. O2 (0–20.9 vol%) and balance N2 gases were continuously passed through the chamber, and their total flow rate was maintained at 10 L min−1. The O2 concentration in the chamber was verified with a Lumidor Minimax sensor (Honeywell Analytics Inc.). Electrochemical tests were performed using a two-electrode system with a black TiO2-sensing electrode and an ITO counter electrode. Analyses were conducted in the PVA/H3PO4 gel polymer electrolyte. Current transient curves of the fabricated sensor were obtained using a potentiostatic method at a constant voltage of 4 V, which was determined in advance by recording current-potential (I-V) curves at various applied potentials (0.5–6 V). The lightness change of the sensing electrode was recorded by 8-bit numerical value using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (α7II, Sony) and analyzed by computational calculations of Hue-Saturation-Lightness color space (HSL model). All measurements were carried out at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. 2.4 Density functional theory calculations Ab initio calculations were carried out by periodic density functional theory (DFT) using a generalized gradient approximation within the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange correction functional [19,20]. A projector augmented wave method was used to describe the ionic cores, as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package [21]. DFT with a U-value (DFT + U) within Dudarev’s approach (U eff = 4.2) was used to account for onsite coulombic interactions in the localized d-orbital of Ti. [22–25] Wave functions were constructed from the expansion of plane waves with an energy cutoff of 520 eV. For anatase TiO2– x , a 3 × 5 × 2 k-point mesh was used as described in the Monkhorst–Pack method, and for rutile TiO2– x , a 4 × 3 × 4 k-point mesh was used to sample the Brillouin zone. Electronic optimization steps were self-consistently converged over 10−5 eV per formula unit. The supercell of anatase TiO2 contained 8 Ti and 16 O atoms (Ti8O16), and that of TiO1.75 contained 8 Ti and 14 O atoms (Ti8O14). 3 Results and discussion Fabrication of the abovementioned sensor is schematically illustrated in Scheme 1 . The sensing (or working) electrode exhibited a layered structure comprising a carbon fabric and nano-sized TiO2, with the former allowing the transfer of air and thus enabling its direct contact with nano-sized TiO2. ITO-coated glass was used as a transparent counter electrode, which acted as a window for contactless observation of color changes in the sensing panel composed of nano-sized TiO2. A PVA/H3PO4 was used as the electrolyte [16–18], as it is a representative GPE for solid-state electrochemical systems because it allows fast charge transport via large overlapping polaron tunneling of ions inside the PVA chains [26]. However, the materials used for fabricating the transparent counter electrode and GPE are replaceable, and not limited to the described system. Nano-sized TiO2 is spherical with ∼30 nm in diameter (Fig. 1 ). The TiO2 nanospheres were spray-coated on the wires of carbon fabric and were well dispersed (Fig. S1 in Supplementary Data); the layered structure of the sensing electrode is shown by cross-sectional SEM imaging (Fig. S2 in Supplementary Data). The TiO2 layer was ∼100 μm thick and exhibited a porous structure, similar to the carbon fabric. This porous multilayer structure allows unlimited air transfer from the environment to the nano-TiO2 sensing panel. Prior to the electrochemical reduction of nano-TiO2 for O2 sensing, its crystal structure was probed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Fig. 1). It revealed the dominance of the anatase phase (anatase: rutile = 95:5), as calculated using the Spurr and Myers equation (Eq. (1) [22,27,28]: (1) A / % = 100 × I A I A + 1.265 × I R where [A] is the anatase content, and IA and IR are the areas of the anatase (101) and rutile (110) peaks, respectively. The porous structure of the sensing electrode allows direct contact of nano-TiO2 with air, resulting in the formation of a three-phase air/TiO2/GPE interface on the surface of TiO2 (Fig. 2 ). Between TiO2 and GPE, the electrochemical reduction of TiO2 occurs when an external potential is applied, and TiO2 is converted to the reduced form (black TiO2, TiO2– x ) (Fig. 2a, b). Chemical re-oxidation of black TiO2 by oxygen adsorbed also occurs spontaneously at Ti sites close to the crystal defects of TiO2– x (Fig. 2b, a) [29]. The location of interstitial Ti and the associated excess electrons in TiO2– x are known to markedly affect the energetics of O2 adsorption atop Ti interstitials [30]. Thus, the response of our solid-state sensor to O2 manifested itself as a change in the Ti:O ratio in black TiO2 (i.e., as a change of x in TiO2– x ). In the absence of oxygen (dry N2, 100%), nano-TiO2 is partially reduced when the external potential (4 V) is applied between the sensing and counter electrodes (Fig. 2b). The electrochromic effect of nano-TiO2 was observed owing to partial reduction. Therefore, the color changed from white to black (Fig. 3 ). The XRD pattern of black TiO2 obtained under O2-free conditions shows peaks of TiO2 and oxygen-deficient phases (Fig. S3 in Supplementary Data) [31,32], with the broadening of the observed peaks compared to those of pristine nano-TiO2 (Fig. 1). This broadening occurs because of the occurrence of oxygen vacancies (VO) and the resulting disorder-induced lattice strain [33]. Under the above conditions, the integral of the nano-TiO2 reduction current directly reflects the stoichiometric change of TiO2 to TiO2– x (Fig. 3a and b). During the change of the stoichiometry of TiO2 – x , the concomitant color change was observed using a charge-coupled device (CCD) system and expressed as a current versus lightness graph (Fig. 3c and d). The numerical 8-bit lightness values were obtained by applying the computational analysis of Hue-Saturation-Lightness color space (HSL model) from the CCD images (inset of Fig. 3c), with the linear correlation between lightness changes and x in TiO2– x (Fig. 3d), implying that the oxidation state of TiO2– x can be directly determined based on the color change of the sensing electrode. Here, the amount of O2 consumed in TiO2 is relatively negligible compared to the amount of O2 in the environment. The fundamental origin of color change was probed by DFT calculations based on the projector augmented wave method [21]. The inherent colors are related to specific crystalline, the colors of which are strongly influenced by the specific band structures of the materials [22]. We calculated the difference in the theoretical band structures of anatase TiO2 and TiO2–0.25 via DFT + U. The band gap energy of orthorhombic TiO2–0.25 (1.1 eV) was much lower than that of anatase TiO2 (2.8 eV) because Ti dz 2 orbital took additional electrons by the oxygen depletion (Fig. 4 ). Thus, the reduction of black TiO2 changed the Ti oxidation state from Ti4+ in stoichiometric TiO2 to Ti3+ in TiO2–0.25, with the removal of one neutral lattice O atom, leaving behind two extra electrons. In contrast to ionic solids, where these extra electrons are localized in the cavity formed by the missing anion and are stabilized by the strong Madelung potential, those in TiO2 prefer to fill the empty orbitals of Ti ions, affording Ti3+ species [29] and thus causing band gap shrinkage and decreasing the lightness of the black TiO2-sensing panel. Notably, similar band gap behavior and lightness decrease were also observed for the reduction of rutile TiO2 to monoclinic TiO2–0.25 (Fig. S4 in Supplementary Data). Oxidation of TiO2– x to as-fabricated TiO2 resulted in the re-uptake of O2, which was fast even under ambient conditions (as high as 14 mmol O2 g–1 min–1, three orders of magnitude higher than that of conventional irreversible O2 scavengers) [13]. Thus, in the presence of O2, sensor resistance and color changed immediately (Fig. 4). Using the above system, we directly investigated the relationship between O2 concentration and sensing panel lightness, demonstrating the existence of a linear correlation in the full range of O2 concentration values, i.e., from ambient to zero (Fig. 5 a). As shown by a schematic in Fig. 1, black TiO2 is simultaneously reduced (Eq. (2)) and oxidized (Eq. (3)) by electrochemical and aerochemical reactions; therefore, the reaction path is changed, as shown below, in an environment containing O2: (2) TiO2 → TiO2– x  + O2: electrochemical reaction (3) TiO2– x  + O2 → TiO2– x + y : aerochemical reaction Experiments and DFT calculations (Figs. 3 and 4) revealed the existence of a linear relationship between the total O content change of TiO2 and the change of lightness (Fig. 5b). To analyze x and y separately, parameter x, corresponding to the extent of electrochemical reduction, was obtained from the integral of the total current and shown to be linearly correlated with O2 concentration (Fig. 5c). Based on lightness change and electrochemical analysis, we described the portion of oxidation by the aerochemical reaction as well (y in TiO2– x + y , Fig. 5d). Both electrochemical reduction and aerochemical oxidation are increased with increasing O2 concentration. Using these phenomena, the electric current passing through the sensor can be quantitatively correlated with the O2 concentration (Fig. S5 in Supplementary Data). Employing the O2 content versus current correlation, we analyzed the cyclic responsibility of the colorimetric sensor at various O2 concentrations (Fig. S6 in Supplementary Data); the results showed that these responses were instantaneous. 4 Conclusions Here, we described the fabrication and performance of a novel solid-state colorimetric O2 sensor based on nano-sized black TiO2. The black TiO2 has a unique colorimetric property and is applicable to the needs of cutting-edge applications. The sensing panel of the above sensor was composed of nano-sized black TiO2 and air-transferring carbon fiber, allowing fast O2 re-uptake and providing favorable electrochromic characteristics under ambient conditions, thus combining the advantages of both conventional O2 sensors and organic-dye-based luminescence systems. This system, still, has also drawbacks to be resolved for the practical applications, such as sensing resolution, possible humidity interference, or difficulty in manufacturing. After further research regarding on them, we believe that our conceptual system can facilitate the development of other novel inorganic and contactless sensors for next-generation multidisciplinary applications.

Here, we develop a colorimetric O2 sensor based on a spherical nano-sized reduced TiO2 (TiO2 – x ) catalyst, which resolves the critical bottlenecks of conventional systems. The sensing mechanism of our O2 sensors relies on two characteristics which are proven by simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. First, nano-TiO2– x , in the partially reduced form, shows a rapid, reversible O2 uptake at room temperature. Second, the partially reduced form of nano-TiO2– x , called black TiO2, shows a change in the lightness of color. Owing to these characteristics, the developed sensor it is well-suited for use at ambient temperature/pressure in the absence of a reference gas, in contrast with the conventional system. Also, it allows long-term operations and it can withstand degradation because the former comprises solid-state inorganic compounds.",
