Rupture of Ni-O bonds by H2 was measured by H2 consumption, both isothermally and with temperature programmed reduction, and growth of Ni atoms into metallic crystallites with isothermal magnetization techniques. Chemical reduction follows a shrinking core model, whereas crystallite growth is best described with a nucleation model in which diffusion of Niatoms from reduction sites to nucleation centers controls the rate. The rates of both these processes are impeded by adsorbed H20. Hydrophilic additives retain surface H20, even when low levels of these additives are present, thereby slowing reduction rates so that reduction must be carried out at significantly higher temperatures. A model is presented to explain these effects and to rationalize the order for reduction temperature: none < SrO < La,_O3 < CaO < MgO Keyn,ords: Reduction; NiO; Additives; Effect of water 1.

Later we examined the effects of Ni loading on reduction of catalysts made by multiple impregnation of ce-Al203 with Ni(NO3)z.6H20 solution [2]. We concluded a small amount of A13+ ions dissolves during impregnation and incorporates into NiO, thereby making these catalysts slightly more difficult to reduce than unsupported NiO itself. Mieth and Schwarz demonstrated similar effects for NiO on ~/-alumina [3]. Lamber and Schulz-Ekloff obtained electron microscopy evidence for surface NiAI204 formation, when NiO on thin films of 3/- or a-Al203 is heated above 500 [4], and Clause et al. detected Ni-doped A1203 and NiO in contact with a NiA1204-type phase [5]. It appears this latter phase gives metallic nickel greater stability against sintering but lowers the reducibility of the original NiO. Nickel catalysts, used commercially for hydrocarbon-steam reforming to produce H2 and carbon oxides [6,7], also contain promoter oxides on a refractory support such as a-Al203 or a spinel-type material. These supports are manufactured at high temperatures and have relatively low surface areas. Nickel is conveniently deposited on the surface by impregnation with a Ni salt solution, followed by drying and calcination to produce Nit. Reduction to dispersed Ni crystallites follows, using H2-containing gases or natural gas-steam feed mix- tures. Reduction conditions are important, and very rapid reduction is usually avoided since it can give lower Ni dispersions and less activity [6]. Alkaline earth oxides, such as MgO, Cat and Bat, as well as ZrO2, and La203 are often incorporated into steam reforming catalysts to provide operational advantages resulting from lower support acidity, higher nickel dispersions, and better steam activation. They may be present as separate phases or combined with A1203 as aluminate or spinel phases. It appears, from our earlier work on precipitated catalysts, that their presence could inhibit Nit reduction if the support were inappropriately formulated, perhaps to such an extent that the temperature necessary for reduction could cause sintering and lower catalytic performance. The present investigation was carried out to examine in detail the effects of some of these additive oxides on the reduction of Nit catalysts prepared by impregnation of preformed a-A1203. 2. Experimental Catalysts containing between 3.5 and 15.8 wt.-% nickel oxide and lesser amounts of Cat, SrO, La203, or MgO were prepared by impregnating mixed nitrate solutions onto preformed porous o~-A1203 Raschig rings (1.7 cm diame- ter, 1.0 cm high) supplied by Katalco Inc. The solution was prepared with the appropriate weight of Ni(NO3)2-6H20 and the additive nitrate in deionized water. The impregnated rings were then dried at 120 and calcined in air for 6 h at 650 to decompose the nitrates. Pore-filling with 3 mol 1-1 Ni(NO3)2 J. T. Richardson et aL / Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 97-112 99 6H20 solution (pH 2.7) during impregnation gives about 5 wt.-% loading of NiO, so the impregnation/calcination procedure was repeated several times to achieve higher loadings. The catalysts were ground in a TEMA agate mill and sieved to particles less than 100 microns in size. Characteristics of the catalysts, such as composition, texture and structure were obtained using identical proce- dures to those described in previous papers [2]. Reduction was monitored by temperature programmed reduction (TPR) using equipment constructed in this laboratory. Hydrogen consumption and magnetic measurements were carried out under the same conditions used previously [2]. Temperature programmed desorption of water measurements were made with a Perkin Elmer TGS-2 thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA). The unreduced sample (50 mg) was loaded, heated in flowing He for 2 h at 650 to remove any volatiles, and then exposed at room temperature for 4 h to a 40 cm3 rain- flow of He saturated with water vapor. After heating at 100 for 2 h to remove physically adsorbed water, the desorption run was started in the same flow of pure helium with a temperature ramp of 10 per minute. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. General properties of the catalysts Properties of the catalysts are given in Table 1, where the sample nomencla- ture indicates the type of oxide additive (N = none, Sr = SrO, etc). Textural properties were consistent with those reported previously (pellet density do = 2.21-2.69 g cm-l; surface area SBE-r=2.0--2.2 m2 g-l; and pore volume Vp = 0.22-0.16 cm3 g-1) and showed no large differences other than those due to higher Nit loadings. Selected catalysts were examined by XRD to determine the amount of Nit, Nit lattice constants and crystallite sizes (Table 2). The amount of Nit detected by XRD was always lower than obtained with conventional XRF analysis by an average factor of 71%. This is consistent with our previous work, and indicates the presence of Nit in some other form or as crystaUites too small for XRD detection [2]. The former is unlikely since there were no XRD lines other than those due to Nit and a-A1203, including the various added oxides and their compounds with A1203. Lattice constants for Nit were remarkably constant, with an average value of 0.4178 + 0.000083 nm. In a series of catalysts with increasing Nit loadings, Richardson et al. found an average value of 0.4178 + 0.00014 nm, indicating the presence of Nit undistorted by added oxides [2]. Even in the MgO-containing sample, there was only slight evidence for solid solution or compound formation. It is well known that mixtures of Nit and MgO form solid solutions at high temperatures, since they have the same crystal structure [8-17] and the lattice constants for Nit and MgO are 0.4177 and 100 Table 1 Catalyst samples J.

These data indicate NiO exists with the same volume-weighted crystallite size in all these catalysts, without evidence of bulk incorporation of the added oxides, with the possible exception of MgO. 3.2. Temperature programmed reduction The effect of adding Ca and Mg is shown in the TPR data of Fig. 1 for catalysts containing approximately the same amount of NiO. Other additives gave similar results, with the increase in the position of the TPR peaks in the order: none < SrO < La203 < CaO < MgO These TPR curves were deconvoluted with 3 to 6 Gidding functions using the program PeakFit from Jandel Scientific running on a Intel-based 486 computer. Typical results for catalyst Ca5 are shown in Fig. 2, with deconvolution data given in Table 3. It is probably not meaningful at this time to assign fundamen- tal significance to the peak positions and areas, other than to note there are distinct regions, possibly corresponding to NiO interacting with the additives to different degrees, and these move to higher reduction temperature in the order listed above. The effect of increasing the amount of added CaO is shown in Fig. 3. There is a slight but detectable shift in the lower temperature peak to higher temperatures and an increase in the intensity of the second peak at the higher CaO levels. Typical results for the effect of changing the impregnated nitrate decomposition temperature are shown in Fig. 4, with no appreciable difference between heating at 550 and 650. 1.0 .........

Deconvoluted TPR peaks for catalyst Ca5. The simplest method to represent the effect of added oxides is to integrate the TPR peaks and use the temperature corresponding to 50% reduction,/'50. These are given in Table 4 for all samples. The following trends are indicated. (1) Increasing NiO concentration gives a slight increase in reduction tempera- ture. This is seen in Table 4 for Groups 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8, and appears to apply in Groups 2 and 7 with the exception of catalysts La3 and Cal2. The same trend was reported earlier for a wider range of concentrations in unpromoted catalysts. The effect was ascribed to progressive incorporation of A13+ ions into NiO as the number of impregnations increase to attain higher loading [2]. Similar effects may occur here, but distinguishing these from the presence of added oxides is difficult.

(3) Catalysts with about the same NiO loading (e.g. N, Sr3, La3 and Mg2) exhibit reduction temperatures that increase in the order for added oxides: none < SrO < La203 < CaO < MgO With the exception of catalyst La3, the added oxide/NiO mass ratio is about 0.1. The increase is significantly large but the effect of MgO may be due in part to solid solution formation, which is known to inhibit reduction.

(4) Increasing the CaO/NiO ratio for catalysts with about the same NiO loading (Ca4, Ca8 and Cal 1) increases the reduction temperature, and the same results are expected for other promoters. 3.3. Magnetic reduction measurements A series of magnetic reduction measurements were made on selected samples in which the catalyst was reduced in situ in a magnetometer cell for 60 min at a given temperature. In each instance, the magnetization was measured at room temperature and used to calculate the amount of nickel agglomerated into Ni crystallites large enough to be ferromagnetic [2]. This procedure was repeated at higher temperatures, using a fresh catalyst sample in each case. Fig. 5 compares the NiO catalyst with those containing added CaO or MgO, each with about the same amount of NiO. The trend is the same; CaO-addition gives a moderate and MgO-addition an extremely large increase in the reduction temperature. The corresponding curves La203- and SrO-addition are very similar and fall below that for CaO-addition. J. T.

Magnetic reduction curves for catalysts N, Ca5 and Mg2. Some limited isothermal reduction kinetic data were obtained for catalyst Ca6. Magnetization measurements as a function of time at 360 were measured at two different hydrogen flow rates (Fig. 6). As previously observed in kinetic studies on the catalyst without any additive [2], increasing the flow rate of H2 gave a faster rate of Ni agglomeration. The curves in Fig. 6 fit a modified Avrami model, Eq. (1) [19-21], exp(- gY)) in which XNi is the conversion of NiO to metallic Ni (as distinct from XNio, the fraction of NiO chemically reduced), and kg is a rate constant for growth with values of 0.208 and 0.386 min- at 43 and 98 cm3 min-1, respectively.

Under identical flow conditions, the presence of CaO gives about a 3-fold decrease in the growth rate constant, even through the temperature is 30 higher. Eq. (1) gave very satisfactory agreement in the previous work, although an exponent of unity was better at lower temperatures and H2 flow rates [2]. This equation is predicted from a nucleation model in which diffusion of Ni atoms to nucleation sites is rate limiting and the value of the exponent depends on particle shape and nucleation kinetics [21]. For example, with 1-dimensional particle growth (i.e. rod-shaped), n is 1.5, 1.5-0.5, and 0.5 if the order of the nucleation rate with respect to nucleation site density is constant, decreasing or zero respectively. Comparisons between the rate of chemical reduction (measured by hydrogen consumption) and nickel growth (measured by magnetic methods) for the catalyst with no additive showed significant differences at low temperatures (270-330) [2,22]. Nickel growth lagged chemical reduction by a time interval which increased as hydrogen flow rates decreased or water vapor was added to the gas. This interval, however, decreased at higher temperatures and disap- peared above 450. These results implied a common cause, retardation of the diffusion process by water molecules retained on the surface. 3.4. Temperature programmed desorption of water The results of water desorption experiments are shown in Fig. 7 for catalysts N, Sr3, La3, Ca3 and Mg2. The samples chemisorbed about the same amount of water (0.3 wt.-%), based on the weight increase when exposed to the moisture- saturated He flow followed by heating at 100.

Assuming this weight loss is due to water desorption only, these results imply that the additives do not change the total amount of retained water but do change the tendency to retain water at higher temperatures in the order: none < SrO < La203 < CaO < MgO 3.5. The effect of added oxides The influence of additive oxides on the reduction of impregnated NiO catalysts is in agreement with the trend reported previously for unsupported precipitated catalysts [1]. Both TPR and magnetization measurements agree that the order for reduction retardation is: none < SrO < La:O3 < CaO < MgO Previously, we noted a correlation between difficulty of reduction for precipi- tated catalysts and the equilibrium constant for reduction of the added oxide. However, the corresponding equilibrium constants for the oxides used here (Table 5) do not show the same correlation, suggesting other factors are important for these effects. The morphology of NiO deposited in the pores of ol-AlaO3 is best described as 30 nm crystallites with some agglomeration into grains twice as large [2]. We have proposed a model for reduction to metallic Ni as follows: (1) hydrogen is dissociated, first on NiO and then rapidly on the surface of Ni clusters as they become available; (2) hydrogen atoms rupture Ni-O bonds, producing Niatoms and HeO molecules. This process is retarded or accelerated by foreign cations in the NiO lattice or on the surface (3) nickel atoms diffuse across the support surface away from the center of reduction. Water retained on the surface (e.g. when using low hydrogen flows or from water added to the reducing gas) retards nucleation by limiting the diffusion process; (4) nickel atoms nucleate into metallic clusters, after an induction period if the overall reduction rate is low (e.g. at low temperatures); 108 J.T. Richardson et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 97-112 (5) the final step is growth into crystallites large enough to be detected by magnetic and XRD measurements. Growth is rapid following nucleation, and 'islands' of Ni atoms form large crystallites. The first step, rupture of Ni-O bonds with H2, was measured by most previous researchers with thermogravimetric techniques and not H2 consump- tion as practised here. These past studies led to a shrinking core model [23], in which the Ni-NiO interface moves towards the center of the grain, leaving behind a metallic product layer. Relevant general theories were refined by Szekely and co-workers [24-28] and applied to experimental measurements on NiO [29]. In these models, kinetic rates are controlled either by diffusion of H2 through the gas phase to the exterior of the particle, diffusion of H2 through the pores in NiO grains, diffusion through the product layer of metallic Ni, or by chemical reaction between NiO and H2 at the interface. When the last situation prevails, the kinetic expression describing the reaction is given by Eq. (4), t (Rg/ko)[1 (1 , ,,/31 = -- -- XNiO/Xm) ] (4) with XNio the fraction of NiO reduced at time t, xm the maximum amount of NiO reduced, Rg the grain radius, and k0 the rate constant. The rate constant, k0, is given by Eq. (5) ko = ks PH/dg RT (5) with ks the intrinsic rate constant for reduction, dg the molar density of NiO in the grain, and PH the H2 partial pressure. In the previous publication on the reduction of model NiO/a-Al203 catalysts without additives [2], we demon- strated the validity of Eq. (4) and Eq. (5), confirming that the process is controlled by chemical reaction at the solid-gas interface and not by diffusion of H2 into or H20 out of the grain. Our data agreed with the conclusions of Sohn and Szekely [28] that three dimensional and fairly symmetrical grains of NiO undergo 'shrinking core' reduction and with recent results of Sridhar et al. [30]. These last authors found values of ks from Eq. (5) almost identical with those reported here. Surface water, from whatever source, influences this solid-gas reaction. The key factor in retarding reduction is the presence of adsorbed H20 molecules or hydroxyl groups on the surface. We have demonstrated this in three critical observations. First, reduction is retarded at low Hz flow rates, so that HzO is not removed rapidly enough. Second, adding external moisture lowers reduction rates significantly. Finally, in this paper we see the effect of additive oxides with an increasing tendency to remain hydrated. It is noteworthy that the temperature at which most of the H20 on the NiO surface desorbs (Fig. 7) is also the temperature at which NiO begins to reduce (Fig. 1). We have demonstrated that the origin of this adsorbed water is not related to diffusion away from the surface, since Eq. (4) is not consistent with diffusion- control and calculated rates for water removal far exceed observed reduction J.T. Richardson et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 97-112 109 rates [2]. However, equilibrium may be established between surface water and the gas phase, and the prevailing adsorption coefficient is increased by the presence of hydrophilic additives. A larger surface concentration of water molecules results, and reduction rates are lower. Baranski et al., in discussing reduction retardation by moisture with model NH3 synthesis catalysts [31], found similar effects to those noted here. This feature was also addressed by Seth and Ross [32], who introduced a reversible first-order reaction for reduction of Fe304. Although the form of Eq. (4) does not change, ko becomes Eq. (6) k~( PH -- Pw/KsR) k0 = (6) dg RT in which Pw is the partial pressure of H20 and KSR the equilibrium constant for the reversible reaction. Spitzer et al. further extended the model to include a Langmuir-Hinshelwood adsorption term [33], whereby k0 is given by Eq. (7), with Kwa the adsorption coefficient for H20. ks( PH -- Pw/KsR) k dgRT(1 + KwaPw) (7) Eq. (6) and Eq. (7) both account for the effect of surface H 2molecules, but it is not possible to discriminate between them with existing data. We implied in an earlier publication that the reversible mechanism in Eq. (6) applies, since the reducibility pattern correlated with equilibrium constants for reduction of additive oxides. Although possible with unsupported samples, where additive ions are uniformly dispersed in the surface layers of NiO, this situation may not extend to supported systems in which NiO crystallites cover only about one third of the surface [2]. In Table 5, equilibrium constants for reduction of the additive oxides used in this work do not correlate with reducibility, but there is a much better correlation between reduction tempera- ture and ability to retain water. Also, the effect of H2 flow rate, even on pure NiO, strongly suggests an impact from adsorbed H20. Eq. (7) is perhaps a more appropriate way to describe the effect. The reactivity of oxides with water vapor was discussed by Fubini et al. in connection with studies of enthalpies for H20 adsorption on various oxides of catalytic interest [34]. These authors found H20 chemisorption in three principal modes: hydrogen-bonded, coordinative, and dissociative, with enthalpies of adsorption in the ranges 50-70 kJ mol-~, 70-120 kJ mol-~, and > 120 kJ mol- 5, respectively. Furthermore, the enthalpy of the dissociative mode and the amount adsorbed increased with the ionicity of the oxide, which was represented qualitatively by the energy band gap of the solid, Eg. Energy band gaps for the oxides in the present study (Table 6) do not correlate with water retention or reducibility of the catalysts (SrO is the exception). Many factors other than bond 110 J.T. Richardson et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 97-112 Table 6 Values of the energy band gap, Eg Oxide Eg a, eV NiO 2.0 La203 2.6 SrO 6.2 CaO 6.7 MgO 8.7 a Re/. [35]. ionicity determine the value of Eg, but these results do suggest a relationship between difficulty of reduction and the hydrophilic nature of the surface. More work is necessary to establish and explain these trends. The second critical part of the reduction process, nucleation of Ni crystallites, is more complicated and very little is known regarding the mechanism. Immedi- ately following Ni-O bond rupture, Niatoms are released from the lattice. The next event in the shrinking core model is rapid agglomeration of these Ni atoms, first into two-dimensional clusters and then 3-dimensional metallic Ni. If, as usually perceived, this agglomeration produces a layer of Ni surrounding the still-reducing NiO core, then the process must be rapid. We demonstrated this is not necessarily the case, since, under appropriate conditions, nucleation and growth lag chemical reduction by a considerable amount of time [2,22]. This suggests Niatoms flow from the site of chemical reduction to the surrounding surface, where they nucleate and grow into Ni crystallites. Supporting evidence is found in our observation that Ni crystallites in reduced NiO/a-A1203 cover much more of the surface than the original NiO, with a fraction of the Ni remaining highly dispersed and undetected with XRD [2]. The process whereby Ni atoms transport from reducing NiO to metallic Ni crystallites may be a type of surface Oswald ripening. The mechanism by which this occurs is far from clear. Nickel oxide reduction itself is not sufficiently exothermic to 'boil off' Ni atoms. However, in the presence of even small amounts of residual carbonates, which could originate from the reagents or from interaction with the ambient atmosphere, methanation during the initial reduction is enough to provide the necessary energy. The form of the equation that best fits the data, Eq. (1), is consistent with this model. The value of the exponent (n = 0.5) points to a growth mechanism in which 2-dimensional diffusion of nucleating species to nucleation centers is controlling. Whether adsorbed water limits the number of nucleation sites or slows diffusion is not clear at this point, but the same factors influencing chemical reduction (H2 flow rate, added H20, and H20-retaining additives) also affect the rate of nucleation. These concepts may be equally applicable to other reduction processes in catalysis. Two important areas are reduction of NiO on high area supports, used J. T. Richardson et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 97-112 111 in many processes such as hydrogenation-dehydrogenation and methanation, and dispersed CuO systems, found in water gas shift and methanol synthesis reactions. Higher reduction temperatures are necessary with hydrophilic supports or components, and this could have an adverse effect not only on the rate of reduction but also on the dispersion of the resulting metallic catalyst. Another system is reduction of ammonia synthesis catalysts, a process which is notori- ously difficult to control and complicated by the presence of multiple oxides [31]. 4. Conclusions This research has shown that certain oxide additives with an affinity for water inhibit the reduction of NiO/o~-A1203 catalysts. Both chemical reduction and Ni agglomeration are affected but by different mechanisms. Chemical reduction of the 'shrinking core' of NiO is controlled by Ni-O bond rupture, which is limited by adsorbed H20 molecules in a type of Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. Nickel growth follows a path in which Niatoms migrate from the reducing NiO crystallite to the surrounding support surface, where nucleation and growth occurs. Nucleation, the controlling process for Ni particle formation, is retarded in the presence of adsorbed water, due to inhibition of the diffusion of Ni atoms over the hydrated surface. For supported NiO without any additives, 'dry' reduction (i.e. with no added water in the gas and at high gas velocities) proceeds via the shrinking core model and agglomeration is rapid. Low gas velocity has a retarding effect on both stages of the reduction, but the effect of added water is much more dramatic. However, these effects diminish as the temperature increases. With certain additives, however, water is retained in sufficient surface concentrations that both chemical reduction and agglomeration are impeded even at higher temperatures encountered in commercial steam reforming operations. These factors should be considered when selecting supports and promoters for catalyst applications. Acknowledgements We are grateful to J. Kennerley and W.M.

This paper is part of a series on the reduction of NiO catalysts and reports results for 4–15 wt.-% NiO, supported on α-Al2O3 and containing small amounts of additive oxides, such as SrO, La2O3, CaO, and MgO. Rupture of NiO bonds by H2 was measured by H2 consumption, both isothermally and with temperature programmed reduction, and growth of Ni atoms into metallic crystallites with isothermal magnetization techniques. Chemical reduction follows a shrinking core model, whereas crystallite growth is best described with a nucleation model in which diffusion of Ni0 atoms from reduction sites to nucleation centers controls the rate. The rates of both these processes are impeded by adsorbed H2O. Hydrophilic additives retain surface H2O, even when low levels of these additives are present, thereby slowing reduction rates so that reduction must be carried out at significantly higher temperatures.
