WHITE Department of Chemistry, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712 (U.S.A.) (Received January 30, 1984; accepted March 5, 1984) Summary Both prereduction and NaOH coating of Ta-doped TiOi are necessary for measurable catalytic activity in gas-phase water decomposition under illumination with band gap light. The addition of RuO; to the catalyst en- hances the rate of water photolysis. The influence of the above factors was studied using several TiO; samples, both doped and undoped, prereduced and nonreduced. The role of Ta-doping, RuO; and NaOH admixtures, and prereduction of the samples is discussed. Introduction Titanium dioxide is well known as a good semiconducting material for both photoanodes in photoelectrochemical cells and photocatalysts which decompose gaseous and liquid water under illumination. TiOa alone is a very inefficient photocatalyst for water vapor decomposition because of a high overpotential for hydrogen evolution and of the difficulty of reversibly rehydroxylating the surface [1-3]. Previous papers from this laboratory showed that prereduced, platinized TiO; particles coated with NaOH de- composed gaseous water when illuminated with the light of energy equal to or higher than the band gap of TiO^ [3-5]. Detailed studies of the influence of preparation methods on the properties of platinum on Ti02 have also been reported [6]. Other authors found that the photoassisted gaseous water decomposition was possible over TiO^ when the catalyst was mixed with other oxides which facilitated hydrogen or oxygen evolution [7,8]. More- over, some doping of TiO; with foreign ions has been used for the photo- catalysts [9, 10] and photoanodes [11], The present paper deals with the influence of the following factors on the gaseous water decomposition reaction over TiO;: (1) tantalum doping, (2) prereduction and (3) RuO^ and NaOH admixtures. *Present address: Department of Chemistry, A. Mickiewicz University, Poznan, Poland. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 380 Experimental Catalyst preparation Pure TiOi was obtained by hydrolysis of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (95%, Alfa Products) in water. When tantalum(V) doping was desired (0.05 at.%), an appropriate amount of tantalum(V) ethoxide (99.995%, Alfa Products) was added to the titanium(IV) isopropoxide prior to hydrolysis. After the water had been added, the slurry was evaporated at about 373 K in a rotating vacuum evaporator, and the precipitate was dried at 383 K overnight. Different temperature and atmosphere treatments of the dry hydroxides were employed as follows: Sample A mixed hydroxides, containing 99.95 at.% of Ti and 0.05 at.% of Ta, were heated in a stream of air (3.6 1 h~1) at 673 K for 4 h, sintered in air at 773 K for 6 h and reduced in hydrogen (3.6 1 h~1) at 873 K for 6 h. Sample B same as sample A, except no reduction in H^. Sample C mixed hydroxides were heated in oxygen (3.6 1 h~1) at 673 K for 6 h. Sample D mixed hydroxides were heated in hydrogen (3.6 1 h~1) at 673 K for 6 h. Sample E pure titanium(IV) hydroxide was treated like sample A. RuC>2 commercial ruthenium(IV) oxide (99.9%, Alfa Products) was oxidized in air at 1073 K for 6 h [12]. After treatment, the oxides were ground in an agate mortar. All the gases were prepurified by passage through 5A molecular sieves immersed in either liquid nitrogen or an ethanol/dry ice bath. Surface area Specific surface area measurements were performed by the conven- tional static BET method, using nitrogen adsorption at 77 K. X-ray diffraction X-ray powder diffraction patterns were taken on a General Electric XRD-5 diffractometer using Cu Ko irradiation. Reaction rates Gaseous water decomposition (GWD) reactions were carried out in a vacuum circulation system (200 ml volume) linked to a mass spectrometer (CEC 21-214). The details of the vacuum apparatus, quartz reaction cell and 200 W high-pressure mercury lamp used for catalyst irradiation were given in previous papers from this laboratory [2 - 5]. The catalysts (0.2 g) were mixed with RuO; (0.05 g), spread uniformly on the bottom of the quartz reaction cell and NaOH solution (0.003 g NaOH mF1) was added. The amount of NaOH introduced was 3 wt.% of the mixture (catalyst + RuOi). After NaOH injection the sample was dried at 315 K under flowing nitrogen. Before reaction the fresh catalyst was outgassed in situ in vacuum (10~7 torr) 381 at 473 K for 2 h. In some cases, after the first run of the GWD reaction the catalyst was outgassed in vacuum (KT7 torr) at room temperature for at least 5 h and used a second time. No heat treatment was applied in this case. After setting the reaction cell temperature at 298 K with a water bath, water vapor (about 25 torr) was introduced into the reaction system. The water used as the reagent was outgassed at least six times in vacuum at dry ice tem- perature. The reaction was started by illuminating the catalyst with the 200 W high-pressure mercury lamp. The reaction products were sampled at adequate intervals and, after passage through a cold trap at about 165 K to remove water, were analyzed by the mass spectrometer. After 1 h the illumination usually was stopped, the 'dark reaction' was observed for about 30 min and illumination was then restarted. The total time of illumination was usually about 4 - 5 h. The details of the GWD reaction conditions are listed in Table 2. Results X-ray analysis and specific area measurements (Table 1) The tantalum-doped samples (TiOs/Ta) heated at 673 and 773 K (B, C, and D), show lines characteristic for anatase only (no rutile). The diffraction patterns for the samples heated in both oxygen (C) and hydrogen (D) at 673 K are identical, and the broad lines indicate a small-particle, ill-defined anatase structure. The sample (B) calcined at 773 K in air has well-defined anatase structure. The samples of both pure (E) and Ta-doped (A) TiO^ reduced in hydrogen at 873 K are mixtures of anatase and rutile, with the rutile content being higher in the Ta-doped sample. Specific surface areas for TiOi/Ta heated at 673 K in both oxygen and hydrogen are identical, about 120 m2 g~1 (see Table 1). The specific surface area drops as the treatment temperature increases (80.0 m2 g\"1 for TiOs/Ta heated at 773 K, and 25.0 m2 g~1 after reduction in H; at 873 K). The specific surface area for pure TiO; reduced at 873 K is only 14.2 m2 g~1.

Although the reaction proceeded slowly, and the rate declined only slightly after 4 h of illumination, the CO and CO; are assumed to form from residual carbon impurities derived from the organometallic reagents used. Mass balance calculations showed that the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen (bonded into CO and CO;) amounted to 2.13:1 after 1 h and 2.2:1 after 4 h. When irradiation was terminated, hydrogen still evolved during the first 15-min interval of the 'dark reaction' and then stopped; the content of CO and CO; did not change in the dark. Adding 0.05 g RuO; did not accelerate the hydrogen evolution, but a small amount of oxygen appeared in the products (Table 2, No. 2, and Fig. 1B). On the other hand, when TiO;/Ta was coated with 3 wt.% NaOH (Table 2, No. 3, and Fig. 2A), hydrogen and oxygen evolved simultaneously at much higher rates and only traces of CO were found in the products (CO; in this case reacted with the base). When the reaction was stopped after 4 h of illumination, the catalyst outgassed at room temperature and the reaction carried out for the second time, the products formed at a comparable rate and the ratio H;:0; = 2. The dark reaction did not proceed in this case. TABLE 2 The GWD reaction conditions and yield of products after 1 h of illumination No. Catal. Amount of RuO; (g) Amoun of NaO;(wt.%) t Outgas. H temp.

When TiOi/Ta was mixed with RuOa and coated with NaOH, the rates of hydrogen and oxygen formation were several times higher than in the cases of RuOa or NaOH alone (Table 2, Nos. 5 and 6, and Figs. 2B and 3). The yields of Hz and 0^ after 3.5 h were 4.84 and 1.36 ^imol, respectively. During the 'dark reaction', only oxygen was consumed (very slowly) by the catalyst. When the GWD reaction was carried out a second time over this same catalyst, the ratio of H; to 0; was 2:1 (stoichiometric mixture). In this experiment the reaction was stopped after 17 h of irradiation, giving 7.3 and 3.6 p.moi of hydrogen and oxygen, respectively (the H 2 pressure was more than 6 torr at the end of the reaction). When the amount of RuC>2 was in- creased to 0.1 g, the yield of products was only slightly lower (Table 2, Nos. 7 and 8). Influence of the wavelength of light on the GWD reaction Experiments were performed with Ta-doped, reduced TiO; mixed with 0.05 g RuOi and coated with 3 wt.% of NaOH. Three cut-off filters were used: (a) a UV filter (415 nm cut-off), (b) a Plexiglass filter (about 380 nm) cut-off) and (c) a Pyrex glass filter (about 275 nm cut-off).

Same sample as in Fig. 2B; - H^ and A-Oi. 385 band gap energy for both anatase (3.2 eV) and rutile (3.0 eV)), the reaction rate dropped to zero. When a Pyrex filter was used, the yield of H2 was lowered by about 50% (Table 2, Nos. 9 and 10) compared to the experi- ments without a filter. When this same catalyst was used a second time, the yield of products dropped by about 75%. The GWD reaction on nonreduced TiO^/Ta/RuO^/NaOH The samples calcined at 673 K in both oxygen and hydrogen (samples C and D) showed similar behavior during UV illumination in the presence of gaseous water (Table 2, Nos. 12 and 13). The yield of hydrogen was about 0.7 yimol after 1 h and about 1.1 /miol after 3 h. No oxygen was found in the products. The 'dark reaction' was negligible in both cases. The sample calcined at 773 K in air gave more H-i and traces of oxygen (Table 2, No. 11). The GWD reaction on prereduced, pure TiO^/RuO^/NaOH The amount of oxygen formed under UV illumination was about the same as on Ta-doped TiC>2, but the yield of tl^, was much lower (Table 2, Nos. 14 and 15). If we assume that the carbon residue in this sample is roughly similar to that in Ta-doped TiO; (the amount of carbon can be estimated from the amount of CO and CO; evolved in the experiments without NaOH coating) and that this carbon is oxidized during illumination, the ratio of H 2 to 0; after 4 h is 1.51:1. When the reaction was carried out a second time, the ratio of H; to 0; was even smaller, indicating the consump- tion of hydrogen by the catalyst. Discussion Ta-doped TiOa was prepared by the hydrolysis of mixed solutions of Ti(i-PrO)4 and Ta(EtO)s. Both are liquids, so preparation of a homogeneous liquid phase is straightforward. We expect that the precipitated hydroxides (and, after calcination, the oxides) will show similar homogeneity. Very similar values of ionic radii of Ti(IV), 0.68 A, and Ta(V), 0.69 A, and the facility of the reduction of Ti(IV) to Ti(III) indicate the possibility of a solid solution formation. In fact, Tani and Baumard [13] found the formation of a solution of Ta in TiO; (rutile) at high temperatures (^1673 K). They deter- mined the solubility of Ta205 in rutile at this temperature to be about 1 at.%. The Ta admixture caused an increase in electrical conductivity of TiOa, which could be attributed to the reduction of an appropriate amount of Ti(IV) ions to Ti(III). When the amount of dopant exceeded 1 at.%, the samples contained an additional separate phase, TiTaaOv. The highest tem- perature that we used was 873 K (the reduction temperature). This tempera- ture lies about 200 C below the Tamman temperature for TiOz. Under these conditions, the sintering of the samples should be slow and take place mainly on the surface. The specific surface area of Ta-doped TiO^ is much higher 386 than that of undoped TiOz prepared under the same conditions. In our opinion, even a very small amount of tantalum (0.05 at.%) is not completely soluble in TiO^ at 873 K, and a part of it exists as a separate phase, e.g. TiTa207 or Ta^Os, and retards the process of sintering of TiO^. This assump- tion is in agreement with a theory of sintering in the presence of a foreign phase [14]. A similar phenomenon has been found for samarium- and gadolinium-doped NiO [15]. The very low solubility of tantalum in Ti02 is not in disagreement with the results of Tani and Baumard [13] because the solubility increases with temperature. These same authors found [16] that in the temperature range 1273 -1673 K the solubility of Nb(V), ionic radius 0.69 A, in Ti02/Nb(V) increased about ten times, from 0.3 at.% to about 3 at.%. We note that the solubility of tantalum in rutile at 1673 K is about three times lower than that of niobium. The Ta-doped, H^-reduced sample was a darker blue color than the pure Ti02, suggesting that the reduction of Ti02 by hydrogen is easier in the presence of tantalum. According to ESR studies [17, 18] reduction by hydrogen at 873 K causes the formation of oxygen vacancies both on the surface and in the bulk of crystallites, and leaves OH\" groups connected to the resulting Ti34\" ions. Serwicka et al. [18] proposed that the mechanism of the reduction by hydrogen at this temperature involves the migration of atomic hydrogen into the lattice to form hydroxyl ions at lattice oxygen sites, followed by the subsequent migration of OH\" to the surface. The rutile modification of TiO^ has open channels which facilitate the diffusion of hydrogen into the crystal bulk and increase the extent of the reduction. Because the Ta-doped sample was richer in rutile than the undoped sample (tantalum facilitates the anatase-to-rutile transformation), it is not surprising that the reduction of Ta-doped Ti02 was more extensive than for anatase. Ta-doped samples treated at 673 K in both oxygen and hydrogen gave the same X-ray diffraction patterns and had identical values of specific sur- face areas. Moreover, they showed identical behavior during irradiation in the presence of water vapor (see below). We suppose that these two samples were nearly identical. Using ESR, DeCanio et al. [19] examined TiO^ reduced in hydrogen at 573 K and found two signals: g = 1.93 and g = 2.00, which were attributed to the presence of Ti3\"1\" ions and F centers, respec- tively. However, when this reduced TiOs was exposed to flowing oxygen at room temperature for several hours, both signals disappeared and a new signal related to the chemisorbed oxygen species appeared. The authors ob- served neither Ti3\"*\" ions nor F centers in Ti02 heated at 673 K in oxygen. According to these findings our samples C and D should differ. However, they were stored in air for a long time, and the chemisorption of oxygen probably led to the incorporation of O2\" ions into the crystal lattice, thus suppressing any initial difference. We now turn our attention to the GWD reaction in the presence of UV irradiation. We focussed on the influence of RuO^ and NaOH additives on the yield of hydrogen and oxygen. Ti02 doped with 0.05 at.% of tantalum 387 and reduced in hydrogen at 873 K was used in these experiments. Under UV illumination of the catalyst in the absence of RuC>2 and NaOH (Table 2 and Fig. 1A) only hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are observed. The amount of hydrogen exceeds the stoichiometric amount of oxygen (bonded into CO and COy). After 4 h of illumination this excess of hydrogen amounts to ca. 0.1 ^mol and, according to previous results from this labora- tory [2, 4, 5], can be attributed to a noncatalytic reaction with the strongly reduced surface of Ta-doped TiOi. The hydrogen (about 1.0 Jumol after 4 h) was formed predominantly by the reaction of water with a carbon residue in the catalyst. As noted earlier, such carbon contamination is expected in catalysts prepared by the hydrolysis of organic compounds of titanium and tantalum. The reaction of water vapor with carbon, although it is thermo- dynamically unfavorable (e.g. for the reaction Cg + H^O = CO; + H^, AG = +7.5 kcal mol\"1), proceeds much more readily than the reaction of water de- composition (AG = +57 kcal mol\"1). The reaction of water vapor with both carbon and lignite was observed previously on Pt/TiO; [20] and on Ru02/ TiO; [21]. Although this reaction was not observed to proceed when a mechanically mixed, nonplatinized TiOi and active carbon were irradiated in the presence of water vapor [20], it is clear that the reaction can take place when small amounts of carbon are bonded to the catalyst. The amount of carbon residue (taken from the amount of CO and CO^) equals about 0.03 wt.% of the catalyst. All the doped catalysts were prepared from hydroxides taken from the same batch, so the same amount of carbon is expected in each sample. When the Ta-doped TiO^ was mixed with RuOz, the hydrogen evolu- tion was similar, but some oxygen was observed in the products (0.02 /xmol after 1 h). Slow water vapor decomposition over oxidized Ti02-Ru02 mix- tures was observed previously by Kawai and Sakata [7]. RuO^ is an oxide with metallic conductivity [22] and is known as one of the best electrode materials for oxygen evolution (lowest overpotential) [23]. We note, how- ever, that in both Ta-doped experiments (with and without RuO;) the amount of hydrogen, and obviously the amount of oxygen, did not exceed monolayer coverage [1, 2] of OH groups (3 X 1017 OH\" m\"2) after 4 h of illumination. As noted above, the addition of small amounts of RuO^ to the catalyst did not improve hydrogen evolution. This is probably caused by poor contact between particles of TiOa and RuOa. Better results have been ob- tained when RuO; was precipitated onto TiO; particles [9,10]. In order to improve the activity, the catalysts were covered by 3 wt.% of NaOH. One can see from Table 2 and Figs 2B and 3 that the Ta-doped TiO;, mixed with RuOa and coated with NaOH, decomposed water vapor and gave relatively high yields of both hydrogen and oxygen. When the reaction proceeded on a fresh catalyst, the ratio ii^'.O^ was greater than stoichiometric (3.65:1 after 1 h). After several hours of illumination the rate of hydrogen evolution dropped, and the gases were formed in the ratio 388 H2:0i =2:1. The initially high hydrogen evolution was caused by the reac- tion of carbon residue with water and/or by the oxidation of the strongly reduced surface of TiO^/Ta. This second process should have less importance in the case of mixed TiO^ /Ta RuO; catalysts because the oxygen evolution proceeds on the ruthenium dioxide particles. When, after several hours of illumination, the catalyst was outgassed and the GWD reaction was carried out for a second time, the reaction still proceeded. In this case, the net rate dropped to zero when the hydrogen pressure achieved more than 0.6 torr (after about 17 h). The ratio of H2:02 was near 2:1. This clearly shows that the GWD reaction on Ta-doped TiOz/RuOz/NaOH is catalytic. From Fig. 2B, the back-reaction (dark period) has no importance. On Pt/TiOi/NaOH, a catalyst much more active in GWD, the back-reaction proceeded rapidly [3,5]. The absence of a good catalyst for water synthesis (e.g. metallic platinum) in the case of TiOz/Ta/RuO^/NaOH makes this back-reaction negligible. Increasing the amount of RuO; (to 0.1 g) mixed with catalyst did not change the yield of products on either fresh or used catalysts (Table 2). From the above results, it is clear that NaOH plays an important role in the photoassisted GWD reaction over TiO^/Ta/RuO^. The addition of NaOH alone (without RuOi) to the catalyst is necessary for photocatalytic activity (Table 2, Fig. 2A). Although the rate of the GWD reaction was not as high as in the presence of RuO^, hydrogen and oxygen were evolved simultaneously, and the ratio was close to two in the second run (used catalyst). The role of NaOH has not been explained in all respects. It was found [5] that NaOH increased the rates of both the GWD and LWD (liquid water decomposition) reactions on Pt/TiOz, and an optimal NaOH coating for GWD and an optimal NaOH concentration for LWD were established. Kruczynski et al. [24] ob- served an increased hydrogen evolution rate when amorphous TiO; was immersed in 50% NaOH and irradiated. The effect of NaOH on GWD and LWD reactions over SrTi03 and Pt/SrTi03 were observed by Wagner and Somorjai [25]. Their suggestions concerning the role of NaOH can be sum- marized in two points: (1) Specific adsorption of OH ions induces band bending and influences the electron-hole separation. This effect is important for metallized catalysts which operate like short-circuited photoelectro- chemical cells. (2) NaOH plays the crucial role in surface rehydroxylation. The difficulty of rehydroxylating the TiO^ surface with water vapor was pointed out by van Damme and Hall [1] and their suggestions have found support in IR experiments [26]. In the Ti02/Ru02 system, ruthenium dioxide plays the role of the anode for oxygen evolution, and hydrogen is evolved on TiO^/Ta. Con- versely, on platinized TiOz or SrTiOa/NiO [8], the Pt (or NiO) is a cathode with a low overpotential for hydrogen evolution, and the semiconductor is the anode. These systems operate like photoelectrochemical cells, although the role of TiO; is reversed. Thus, for TiOi/Ta/RuO^ the effects of both (1) and (2) are probably important. Moreover, in the case of mechanically mixed TiOz/Ta-RuOi, the NaOH coating is of value for an improvement of the contact between the catalyst and the ruthenium dioxide particles. As was 389 mentioned above, the addition of 0.05 g RUU2 to 0.2 g TiO^/Ta did not change the yield of hydrogen (compared to TiO^/Ta alone) and caused the evolution of only traces of oxygen. On the other hand, the NaOH coating (without RuO;) caused the simultaneous production of H^ and 0^ but in small amounts. The GWD reaction over TiO:>/Ta/Ru02/NaOH gave yields of HI and C>2 about six times higher than over TiOs/Ta/NaOH. For comparison, pure Ti02 was used as a catalyst, and the GWD reac- tion was carried out over the system TiO^/RuOi/NaOH (Table 2). The yield of oxygen was similar to that using the system TiOi/Ta/RuOi/NaOH, on both fresh and used catalysts. The amount of hydrogen produced was much lower, and when the reaction was carried out for the second time on this sample, the ratio H^O; was lower than 2 (about 1.5 after 1 h). Surface reduction during UV illumination of semiconductors such as TiO^ or SrTiC^ in the presence of water has been observed by some authors [24, 25, 27]. It is surprising, however, that reduction occurs on the prereduced surface of this catalyst, but not on the surface of TiO^/Ta. This question cannot be answered here unequivocally. We can state only that: (1) The surface of Ta-doped TiO; is more strongly reduced than of pure Ti02 (darker blue). (2) The admixture of Ta(V) causes the formation of appropriate amounts of Ti3\"1\" ions and, because the dopant is expected to occur mainly on or near the surface of TiO;, it is possible that it prevents the formation of additional Ti3\"1\". If we compare the results of GWD reaction on nonreduced TiO^/Ta/ RuOz/NaOH (Table 2) with the results described above, it is clear that pre- reduction plays an important role. Although it is expected that the non- reduced samples possess small amounts of Ti3\"1\" ions (connected to the Ta-doping), such reduction is not sufficient for the activity of GWD reaction. In the case of TiOi/Ta heated in both oxygen and hydrogen at 673 K, only hydrogen was formed under UV illumination and the maximum amount was 1.15 ^mol (about 7 X 1016 OH groups m~2) which is much less than mono- layer coverage. For TiO^/Ta heated at 773 K in air, the amount of H^ also did not exceed the monolayer coverage (1.1 X 1017 OH groups m\"\"2), but a small amount of oxygen was found in the products. It is clear that the pre- reduction is necessary for (1) the formation of the surface states which are able to oxidize the oxygen ions, (2) for the reduction of hydrogen under UV illumination (the system TiOi/Ta prereduced at 873 K/NaOH decomposed water) and (3) for electron-hole separation necessary for hole transport to theRu02. Experiments with cut-off filters show that illumination with light of energy equal to or higher than the band gap of TiO^ (3.0 eV for rutile and 3.2 eV for anatase) causes the photodecomposition of water. The use of 415 nm and 380 nm cut-off filters completely suppressed the reaction, while the Pyrex glass filter partly suppressed the GWD reaction. Very similar results were obtained previously for Pt/TiOi [5]. 390 Although it is not possible to establish unequivocally the mechanism of GWD reaction on reduced TiOi/Ta/RuOi/NaOH catalysts, we can make the following remarks: (1) Both the prereduction and the NaOH coating of TiOa/Ta are neces- sary for its catalytic photoactivity in GWD reaction. Both are involved in the creation of some surface states able to decompose water under illumination and, in the case of mixed TiC^/Ta/RuO^ catalysts, are responsible for electron-hole separation. Moreover, the NaOH coating makes possible the rehydroxylation of the surface (dissociative adsorption of water) and im- proves the contact between particles of Ti02/Ta and RuO;. (2) Although the presence of ruthenium dioxide is not necessary for the GWD reaction on TiO^/Ta coated with NaOH, it distinctly improves the yield of products by mediating the oxidation of 0~2 (electron transfer from oxygen ions to the semiconductor). (3) The influence of tantalum doping on the GWD reaction is not entirely clear. It does not extend the spectral response into the visible light region (as, e.g. do Cr3\"^ ions). It does not improve the yield of products com- pared to pure TiO;, but it does retard the reduction of the catalyst by evolved hydrogen.

White Department of Chemistry, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712 U.S.A. * Present address: Department of Chemistry, A. Mickiewicz University, Poznań, Poland. Both prereduction and NaOH coating of Ta-doped TiO2 are necessary for measurable catalytic activity in gas-phase water decomposition under illumination with band gap light. The addition of RuO2 to the catalyst enhances the rate of water photolysis. The influence of the above factors was studied using several TiO2 samples, both doped and undoped, prereduced and nonreduced.
