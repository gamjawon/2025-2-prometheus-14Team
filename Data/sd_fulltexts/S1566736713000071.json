Mixed molybdenum oxides are widely used catalysts for propylene oxidation to acrolein or acrylic acid or for methanol oxidation in the gas phase. In the present study, however molybdenum oxides exhibited an epoxidation activity in the gas phase. To achieve this activity, the oxidation state, particle sizes and accessibility of molybdenum oxides are needed to be controlled. Such active molybdenum species can be prepared by PVD deposition of molybdenum nanorods and their subsequent oxidation in a controlled atmosphere. Accordingly, monoclinic MoO2 particles with a diameter of <10nm can be prepared, which exhibit 42% selectivity to propylene oxide (the byproducts of the oxidation being mainly acrolein and acetone). In comparison, molybdenum-containing catalysts prepared by traditional impregnation methods exhibited practically zero epoxidation activity in gas-phase epoxidation of propylene. Highlights ► It is possible to prepare molybdenum nanorods by a PVD technique. ► A mild oxidation of Mo nanorods results in the creation of monoclinic MoO2 nanodomains. ► MoO2 nanodomains exhibit an epoxidation activity in the gas phase. ► Bulky MoO2 or other molybdenum oxides lack this epoxidation activity. Keywords Molybdenum oxides Nitrous oxide Propylene oxide Epoxidation 1 Introduction It's well known that several materials, when in nano- or well-ordered form, exhibit catalytic properties different from those of in bulk phase [1]. Gold nanoparticles [2], thin vanadium oxide layers [3] or zeolytic materials [4] can be mentioned as examples which later gained industrial importance. This trend is also true for the case of epoxidation of propyelene, the second–third largest consumer of propylene worldwide [5]. There were several new catalytic systems described for the gas-phase epoxidation of propylene, mainly based on gold [2], iron [6], and other [7] active metals. Those systems intend to overcome the basic obstacle of the direct epoxidation — up to now not viable using “conventional” catalysts — the disposition of propylene to allylic oxidation. For the reason of the reactivity of the allylic hydrogen atom in the propylene molecule, the industrial production of propylene oxide (PO) is up to now based on chlorohydrine or peroxide processes [5]. In the present work we focused on molybdenum oxides as catalysts for propylene epoxidation in the gas phase using nitrous oxide as an oxidizing agent. Nitrous oxide, in comparison with molecular oxygen, was shown to contribute more feasibly in oxygen additions to organic compounds [8,9], however its industrial usage may be limited by its accessibility. Silica-supported MoO3 was suggested by Song et al. [10] as an active phase for the epoxidation of propylene by molecular oxygen. The authors hypothesized the generation of gas-phase radicals on the catalyst's surface, which subsequently yield PO by homogeneous reaction. The fact that Mo(VI) oxide was suggested as a catalyst for propylene epoxidation, points to an interesting question: Mo(VI) oxide is industrially used in large scales as a component of the catalysts for propylene oxidation to acrolein, what is an example of allylic oxidation. Would it be possible to use molybdenum oxide catalysts for epoxidation, which is a vinylic oxidation, by modifying either the oxidation state and/or the particle size of molybdenum oxides? Marin-Flores et al. [11] reported MoO2 as a promising anode material in fuel cells for partial oxidation of the aviation fuels to CO and H2. The authors [11] found the formation of molybdenum carbide as a possible source of the deactivation of the catalyst at the reaction temperature of 500°C. The phase transformations of molybdenum oxide nanoparticles were also investigated for their application in Li-ion batteries [12]. SBA-15-supported MoOx nanoparticles were reported in partial oxidation of ethane by molecular oxygen [13]. Bañares [14] suggested Mo5+ species to be active in the latter reaction. Molybdenum-based catalysts were also reported in a review by Baerns et al. [15] for the selective oxidation for methane. Our aim was to elucidate the active structure in a molybdenum oxide-based catalyst for selective propylene epoxidation. For that purpose powdered metallic molybdenum, molybdenum deposited on fumed silica by wet impregnation method and molybdenum deposited by PVD method on Si/SiO2 support have been tested in various reaction conditions. The microstructure of PVD deposited metallic layers is described by the well-known Thornton diagram of film growth [16]. A detailed study of Thornton's model for a metal deposition at low substrate temperature was performed by Petrov et al. [17]. Here the possibility to deposit porous films with various aspect ratios of individual metallic islands has been shown. Accordingly, there is a possibility to prepare discontinuous porous metallic films consisting of separated needle-shaped islands, potentially suitable as oxidation catalysts. 2 Experimental As a basis for comparison, pure polycrystalic metallic molybdenum was used as a catalyst (Aldrich, 99.99% Mo, grain size <150μm). The metal powder was diluted with quartz chippings (grain size 0.1–0.3mm) in a weight ratio of 1:19. Supported molybdenum oxide catalysts, deposited by impregnation, were prepared by adding 10g of silica Aerosil® 200 to 150ml of water solution of ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate. The silica was dried at 200°C overnight before weighing. The suspension was mixed overnight, evaporated and dried at 200°C in air. Two sets of samples were prepared, one with 0.5%, and another with 5% of molybdenum oxide load, calculated as wt.% of MoO3. The silica-supported ammonium molybdate samples were then calcined at the following conditions: 277°C in air, 530°C in air, 500°C in hydrogen, 450°C in helium/4%propylene mixture, 330°C in helium, 530°C in helium, and 450°C in nitrous oxide. Similarly, molybdenyl acetylacetonate, as well as MoO2Cl2 has been tested as molybdenum precursors to prepare silica-supported MoOx catalysts. For the samples prepared by magnetron sputtering the molybdenum layer was deposited on oxidized Si wafers with the thickness of 0.6mm (the surface silicon oxide thickness was 10nm) and with a surface roughness of 0.6nm, at the substrate temperature of −50°C, by magnetron sputtering, using a dc magnetron, in a cryopumped apparatus with the base pressure of 10−5 Pa. The substrate–target distance was 70mm; the sputtering rate of 100nm/min was kept constant and the deposition rate was adjusted by the velocity of the substrate movement over the Mo target. The Mo deposition was done in an argon atmosphere at a pressure of 5Pa. The as-prepared Mo/SiO2/Si samples were crushed to a grain size of 0.1–0.3mm and were tested for the epoxidation reaction, either as-prepared, or pre-oxidized in the reactor and subsequently used in the catalytic tests (see Section 3.1). Two sets of samples were prepared by this method, with a thickness of Mo layer of 100nm and 300nm respectively, thus the overall metal loading was 38 and 113ppm. The catalytic tests were carried out using a fixed-bed quartz reactor with an i.d. of 12mm, at the temperature of 450°C. The temperature was measured in the center of the catalyst bed. 1g of the catalysts was used, with a grain size of 0.3–0.6mm. The catalysts prepared on silicon plates were crushed and sieved. The catalysts with the Aerosil support were pressed at 20MPa prior to crushing and sieving. The propylene and the oxidizing agent were introduced into the reactor at atmospheric pressure, using 2ml.min−1 of propyene and 35ml.min−1 of the oxidizing agent. The reaction mixture was analyzed on-line by GC equipped with Porapak and Carbosieve columns and FID and TCD detectors. The reaction products were identified by GC-MS (Shimadzu QP5000). The single-point BET surfaces of the catalysts were measured on a Micromeritics Pulse Chemisorb 2700 apparatus. The XRD measurements of the molybdenum samples deposited by PDV were carried out using a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer in a parallel beam geometry with parabolic Goebel mirror in the primary beam, in grazing incidence setup with the angle of incidence 1.5°. For the powder samples, prepared by impregnation from ammonium molybdate solution, the XRD patterns were recorded using a STOE Stadi MP apparatus in Bragg–Brentano geometry. For the TEM a JEOL 1200EX microscope at accelerating voltage of 120kV was used. 3 Results 3.1 XRD analyses For the fresh catalysts, prepared on the Si/SiO2 support by magnetron sputtering, as expected, metallic Mo is the only diffracting phase (not shown), regardless of the thickness of the molybdenum layer. These parent samples were introduced to the test reactor, and were heated in the propylene/N2O flow (4% propylene) to the reaction temperature of 450°C. The reaction conditions were maintained for 120min. The catalysts were then cooled down to laboratory temperature in the atmosphere of propylene/N2O mixture. The XRD patterns were subsequently recorded (Fig. 1a). Independently on the thickness of the original molybdenum layer, a monoclinic MoO2 phase (tugarovite) can be observed, together with a minor amount of residual molybdenum (peak at 42°), with no other diffracting phase present. Afterwards, the samples were re-introduced into the test reactor and were further oxidized in air flow at 530°C for 2h. The XRD patterns of these oxidized samples show a complete recrystallization of the molybdenum oxide, again, independently on the thickness of the original Mo layer (Fig. 1b). The tugarovite phase practically and exclusively changed to orthorhombic molybdite — MoO3. For the sample prepared by impregnation by (NH4)6Mo7O24 solution (5% molybdenum oxide), the activation in air at 277°C resulted in a mostly amorphous phase (Fig. 2a); an activation at 530°C gave most of orthorhombic MoO3 phase (Fig. 2b), in accordance with Wienold et al. [18]. The activation in pure N2O at 450°C resulted in a formation of a similar orthorhombic MoO3 phase (Fig. 2c), hence the nitrous oxide being an oxidizing agent active enough to generate Mo6+ species. Heating in helium at 330°C (Fig. 2d) gave a mixed hexagonal–orthorhombic MoO3 phase. A further heating to 530°C in helium (Fig. 2g), however, obviously led to a loss of oxygen from the original MoO3 phase and to the formation of MoO2–tugarovite phase. The same loss of oxygen was achieved by treating the samples either by hydrogen at 500°C (Fig. 2e) or by N2O/propylene mixture at 450°C (Fig. 2f). The formation of MoO2 upon hydrogen treatment is in accordance with Wienold et al. [18]. Wienold et al. reported a development of a mixed MoO3–Mo4O11 phase upon decomposition of unsupported ammonium molybdate during the helium treatment up to the temperature of 500°C, hence the treatment in helium flow reduced the oxidation number of the molybdenum atom. In our case, at 530°C the silica-supported ammonium molybdate underwent a reduction of the Mo atom from oxidation state VI to IV. The samples, prepared by impregnation by ammonium molybdate solution, at 0.5% molybdenum oxide content, showed a severe uncertainty in the quality of the diffraction data (not shown). One has to consider the principal difference between powdered MoOx/SiO2 samples and samples prepared by PVD: due to the localization of the MoOx phase on the top of the sample in the case of the sample prepared by PVD, the MoOx layer can be characterized by low-angle XRD technique even at the concentration of the molybdenum oxide below 0.1%, while in the case of the samples prepared by impregnation, the phase characterization below 1–5% metal oxide content reaches its bottom limit. Hence, the MoOx/SiO2 samples need further characterization methods. Another reason, calling for further characterization is the catalytic activity of the abovementioned samples. For the samples prepared by impregnation, the catalytic activity was corresponding with the metal content, while the product distribution of propylene oxidation was practically unaffected by the metal content. On the other hand, interestingly, for the samples prepared by PVD, the product distribution was dependent on the metal content, and the overall catalytic activity was inversely proportional to the metal content (see Section 3.4), therefore the samples prepared by PVD were further characterized by electron microscopy. 3.2 TEM analyses The argon pressure (5Pa) employed during molybdenum deposition, resulted in a discontinuity of the Mo growth in the case of samples prepared by PVD. The fresh Mo films consisted of nanocrystals ordered in “rods” perpendicular to the film plane. The diameters of these rods were rather uniform, cca. 10nm. The nanorods are forming a further structure; this secondary structure consists of islands of several rods. The in-plane size of these islands depends on the thickness of the Mo film, and is inversely proportional the overall thickness: it was ~20nm for the film thickness of 100nm and ~60nm for the film thickness of 300nm. The islands are separated each other by elongated pores/voids (Fig. 3a,b). When the Mo/SiO2/Si samples are subjected to an atmosphere of N2O/propylene mixture at 450°C for 2h, a formation of nano-domains of MoO2 inside the Mo-nanorods can be observed (Fig. 3c,d). These MoO2 particles — detected also by XRD — with a diameter of ~<10nm are incorporated in the unoxidized molybdenum matrix. A further oxidation of the samples in air at 530°C resulted in a loss of the structure of the nanorods and nanodomains of MoO2 and in a formation of large (~200–500nm), well-developed crystals of MoO3 (Fig. 4a,b). Hence, depending on the choice of the oxidizing atmosphere, it is possible to prepare a rather well-defined Mo(VI) and Mo(IV) oxides. However, the reversibility of the redox process is another important parameter in catalytic applications. In an attempt to restore the original MoO2 phase, the air-oxidized samples, comprising MoO3 crystallinites, were subjected again to a N2O/propylene mixture at 450°C for 2h. The major effect of this treatment, however, was an exfoliation of the MoO3 phase, resulting in a lamellar structure and a re-occurrence of the MoO2 phase, but not restoring the original tugarovite nanodomains (Fig. 4c,d). 3.3 Specific surface areas The specific surface areas of the PVD-prepared fresh samples were rather low: 3.8m2.g−1 for the film thickness of 100nm, and 2.6m2.g−1 for the film thickness of 300nm. As the geometric surface area of the support material was practically zero, we can attribute these surfaces to the deposited molybdenum. For the samples prepared by impregnation, the measured surface areas represent mostly the surface area of the support, slightly deteriorated by the deposited phase (Table 1 ). 3.4 The catalytic activity of the Mo-containing samples Metallic polycrystalline molybdenum was inactive in the epoxidation reaction, either in its original or in pre-oxidized form. If one considers that the specific surface area of molybdenum powder, several few square meters per gram, is comparable to that of the PVD-deposited samples, it is obvious that the presence of some metallic surfaces is not enough to prepare a good catalyst. Generally, the catalytic performance of the samples prepared by impregnation from the ammonium molybdate solution was poor. The propylene conversion increases slightly (from 0.3 to 0.9%) when increasing the Mo content 10-fold, from 0.5% to 5%, but the distribution of the products of the oxidation favors the products of allylic oxidation or total oxidation, with very low yields of PO (see Table 2 ). The catalytic activity of the samples prepared from molybdenyl acetylacetonate or MoO2Cl2 precursors exhibited similar PO yields. On the other hand, the propylene conversion over the samples prepared by PVD reached up to 7.9%. The selectivity toward PO changed significantly depending on the pre-treatment of the catalyst. There is also a difference in the propylene conversion depending on the thickness of the deposited Mo layer. The catalyst with a thinner Mo film (100nm) gave 7.9% conversion in the first hour of time on stream (TOS), slightly decreasing in time. The selectivity to PO decreased gradually in 8h of TOS (from 43% to 28%). The thicker film, however resulted in a less active and selective catalyst (see Fig. 5 ). The catalysts prepared by PVD after 8h TOS were oxidized in air at 530°C for 2h, and were tested again in propylene oxidation. As it can be expected, a formation of a MoO3 phase deteriorated the epoxidation activity of these samples. A question emerges, whether the high surface area of the Aerosil doesn't interact with the epoxidation pattern. According to Song et al. [10] in propylene epoxidation with air, the reaction mechanism can involve catalyst-induced gas-phase radical reactions (cold flames). If there are cold flames, can the low epoxidation activity of the Aerosil-supported catalysts be explained by the quenching of the radicals necessary for the PO formation by the abundant high-surface silica? To answer this question, the PVD-prepared, crushed catalysts were diluted by aerosol in a ratio of 1:5 (excess of Aerosil), and all the heated parts of the reactor were filled with this material, with the aim of quenching the gas-phase radicals in the free voids in the reactor. Interestingly, this procedure deteriorated the concentrations of acetone and acrolein in the product stream to the level of cca. ¼ of the original concentration, while it did not practically change the concentration of PO. Unfortunately, when the carbon balance was checked, it has been found that the Aerosil addition only soaked the acetone and acrolein and led to carbon deposition in the reactor. Nevertheless, it is of interest to find out that abundant silica can distort the acetone and acrolein yields, but does not deteriorate PO formation, which is either formed on the catalysts' surface, or by gas-phase reactions which are not quenched by high-surface silica. 4 Discussion It has been found that molybdenum oxide catalysts can contribute not only to the well-known allylic oxidation of propylene — what is industrially employed in large scale — but also to an epoxidation. The oxidation state and particle size of molybdenum oxides seem to influence significantly their catalytic performance. In accordance with Wienold et al. [18] it has been demonstrated that the oxidation state of molybdenum can be finely tuned by the temperature and the composition of the atmosphere, but to control the oxidation state is not enough in terms of good activity. It has been found that the presence of a MoO2 phase is a necessary but not a sufficient criterion for the epoxidation activity. In the case of silica-supported MoOx catalysts the generation of the MoO2 phase was possible either by treatment in hydrogen at 500°C, or in helium at 530°C, or in propylene/N2O mixture at 450°C, but such a bulky MoO2 phase had very low activity in the epoxidation reaction (2–4% selectivity to PO). This selectivity will drop to zero if the samples were oxidized in air at 530°C or in N2O at 450°C i.e. the molybdenum was oxidized exclusively to MoO3. On the other hand, MoO2 nanodomains formed upon mild oxidation of molybdenum nanorods (450°C in propylene/N2O mixture) exhibit unexpected epoxidation activity. In a good catalyst the nanorods are oxidized to MoO2 domains, but the nanostructure remains preserved. Upon more severe oxidation (530°C in air), the nanorods are overoxidized to an inactive MoO3 phase, together with a profound change in the morphology: formation of large molybdite (MoO3) crystals. Those crystals can be reduced back to MoO2, but neither their nanostructure, nor their epoxidation activity can be reconstructed. It's worth to notice several details: (i) the overall molybdenum content of a PVD-prepared catalyst is in the order of 0.1%, while the Mo-content of the catalyst prepared by impregnation was greater by an order of magnitude. In spite of this difference in the Mo-content, the PVD-prepared catalyst was more active (7.9% propylene conversion for the PVD-prepared catalyst vs. 0.9% for the one prepared by impregnation). (ii) The specific surface area of the PVD-prepared catalyst is rather low: several square meters, contrary to several hundred square meters for the impregnated catalyst. (iii) For the PVD-prepared catalyst the active phase is concentrated in a thin layer, hence the epoxidation is catalyzed by a pure molybdenum oxide. Hence, the turnover frequency (the amount of PO formed per minute and per molybdenum atom) in nano-MoO2 catalysts is higher by at least two orders of magnitudes in comparison with the catalysts prepared by impregnation. Moreover, the available surface area of MoO2 nanorod-based catalysts is lower by two orders of magnitude in comparison with that of the silica-supported catalysts, indicating that in comparison with silica-supported catalysts, the MoO2 nanorods require much less volume to produce the same amount of PO. As the nanorods tend to form larger islands upon increasing the thickness of the molybdenum film, a diffusion in such catalysts is to be a considerable limit: the lower accessible surface of the thicker films (in spite the higher metal content), together with the diffusion problems in the case of MoO2 particles located deep in the islands, leads to a deterioration of the overall activity and to overoxidation of the otherwise sensitive PO molecule. For iron-containing catalysts used in propylene epoxidation, the regeneration by air is already known [9]. There the function of the regeneration by air is in removing the coke deposits on one hand, and to affect the oxidation state of the iron on the other hand. However, unfortunately, for the molybdenum-containing catalysts such regeneration is not practically possible. The active MoO2 particles in the nanorods, generated by the oxidation of molybdenum by N2O/propylene mixture, are not stabilized enough to withstand a de-coking by molecular oxygen; the air activation leads to an irreversible rearrangement. 5 Conclusions Nano-sized MoO2 particles (with a diameter of <10nm), stabilized in a nanorod matrix has been found as promising catalysts for the epoxidation of propylene with N2O. The nanorod structure was created by a magnetron sputtering deposition of a nanoporous Mo film on a Si/SiO2 surface and its careful oxidation in a N2O/propylene atmosphere. The texture of the deposited molybdenum film can be tuned by the presence of argon during the deposition: a relatively high Ar pressure leads to a deposition of a discontinuous Mo film. The catalytic activity of the nanorod-based catalysts is much higher in comparison with the non-nano form (7.9% conversion and 43% selectivity vs. 0.9% conversion and 2% selectivity). The oxidation state and the morphology of the molybdenum layer deposited by PVD can be schematically depicted as: 1. during the catalytic test at 450°C: Mo (nano)+N2O (+propylene)→MoO2 (nano, good epoxidation activity); 2. during the reactivation at 530°C: MoO2 +O2 →MoO3 (larger crystals); and 3. during the second reaction cycle at 450°C: MoO3 (larger crystals)+propylene→MoO2 (larger crystals, not catalytically active anymore). Hence, the MoO2 nanoparticles, responsible for the epoxidation activity, are irreversibly overoxidized (thus deactivated) upon air-treatment.

Such active molybdenum species can be prepared by PVD deposition of molybdenum nanorods and their subsequent oxidation in a controlled atmosphere. Accordingly, monoclinic MoO2 particles with a diameter of <10nm can be prepared, which exhibit 42% selectivity to propylene oxide (the byproducts of the oxidation being mainly acrolein and acetone).
