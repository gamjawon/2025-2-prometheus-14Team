A. DALMON and C. MIRODATOS* Institut de Recherches sur la Catalyse, CNRS, 2 av. Albert Einstein, 69626 Villeurbanne, Cedex (France) Summary Exchange of methane with deuterium has been used to study the possible relations between intrinsic kinetic data (selectivity, true activation energy, active site requirements) and the changes in the supported nickel properties due to alloying, promoting or poisoning effects. Mechanistic infor- mation dealing with the formation of the main isotopic products (CH^D and 004) are provided. The effects observed on nickel poisoned by HaS or in a SMSI state are shown to originate only from a loss of active surface. Alloying nickel with copper induces a geometric dilution effect with a modification in exchange selectivity. For nickel catalysts promoted by potassium, evidence of an electronic effect is provided considering the changes in the true activation energy of the reaction. Some comparisons with the CO + H; reaction are also proposed. Introduction Economically attractive reactions such as steam reforming of methane for hydrogen production or conversion of synthesis gas in methanation (SNG production) necessarily deal with the elementary steps of methane adsorp- tion and desorption: in the steam reforming of methane, it is generally assumed that the reaction of methane adsorption CH^^CHx + (4 ;x:)H is rate determining [1, 2]. During methanation of carbon monoxide, a serious problem arises from the decomposition of methane which, like CO dispro- portionation, may cause a carbon deposition on the catalytic surface and then a decrease in CO conversion [3]. Among the material actually used for the purpose of methanation, nickel catalysts still play a major industrial role, although greatly modified by alloying, promoting or support effects. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-6102/84/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 162 The exchange of methane with deuterium has been used in the present investigation to study a series of silica-supported nickel catalysts. This reac- tion, the first extensive approach of which was carried out by Kemball 30 years ago [4], provides information both on the relative activity of the cata- lysts and on the surface radicals involved in the methane adsorption and desorption processes [5, 6]. Moreover, by maintaining the temperature and the feed composition constant but changing either the support or the condi- tions of activation or adding promoters such as potassium or poisons such as hydrogen sulfide, one observes unrelated variations in the deuterated methane distribution (exchange selectivity); information on the nature of the surface active sites may then be deduced from the exchange experiments. Another reaction, that of carbon monoxide hydrogenation, was per- formed on the same samples for comparison with the exchange results. Experimental Catalysts A reference nickel/silica catalyst was prepared by reduction in hydro- gen of a 23 wt.% nickel precursor at 923 K for 15 h with a heating rate of 2 C min\"' [7, 8]. Reduction at higher temperature (e.g. 1273 K) was per- formed in some experiments in order to get larger particles and a SMSI (Strong Metal-Support Interaction) state. Ni Cu/silica catalysts [9] were reduced at relatively high temperature, 1173 K, in order to form a fully reduced homogeneous alloy with a well- defined particle size distribution. K-promoted Ni/SiO; catalysts were prepared by adding KNC>3 to the Ni/SiC>2 precursor and reduced under flowing hydrogen at 923 K. Physico- chemical data concerning the latter catalysts are given in ref. 10. The extent of reduction and the average particle size of the catalysts for a given reduction procedure were determined using magnetic and volumetric measurements [8] (see Table 1). Exchange reactions Methane exchange reactions were carried out in a silica dynamic micro- reactor, with a small amount of the flow leaking continuously through a heated capillary into a VG-type MM6 mass spectrometer for isotopic analy- sis. On-line FID chromatography allowed verification of the total concen- tration of methanes in the flowing feed stream. All gases deuterium, hydrogen, helium and methane (Air Liquide) - were passed through the usual Deoxo and zeolite traps before use. Before exchange runs, the catalysts were given a standard pretreatment (H; reduction at 923 K for 15 h, then He treatment down to the exchange temperature) unless otherwise stated. A premixed helium-deuterium- methane stream was then passed over the catalyst at a fixed flow rate of 60 cm3 min\"1. 163 In order to study the poisoning effect by H^S, the reactant gas stream was diverted through a glass dosing valve before reaction, allowing contact of the catalyst with known amounts of pulsed H2S. Raw experimental data from the mass spectrometer were corrected for the natural occurrence of heavy isotopes and for fragmentation following conventional computation techniques. The resulting distribution patterns allowed calculation of the rate of the total exchange reaction from the disappearance of light methane or from the rate of formation of the deuterated methanes. Actually, in accordance with previous studies of methane exchange under static conditions [6], only mono- (CI^D) and per- deuteromethane (CD4) were identified as initial products, and the study was restricted to their respective rates of formation. CO + H^ reaction Hydrogenation of carbon monoxide was carried out with a CO/H; ratio fixed at 0.25 in a conventional dynamic system as described in ref. 11. The poisoning effect was studied for this reaction on catalysts pretreated at room temperature under Hy3, the adsorbed amount of H^S being gradually increased up to the equivalent of a monolayer corresponding to about 20 cm3 H2S (g Ni)~1. A treatment under vacuum at 573 K was then performed before reaction in order to avoid further changes in the surface state. Results CO + H-i reaction The formation of the two main products, CH4 and C^Hg, are expressed according to the reactions (1) and (2) CO ^CH4 (1) CO > C^He (2) Considering the respective intrinsic activities A(l) and A(2), one can calcu- late the selectivity as follows: S- A(2) A(1)+A(2) Figure 1 reports the changes in the CO conversion A and the selectivity S as a function of the H;S coverage. It should be noted that the activity decreases linearly with @HS while the selectivity remains unchanged. The kinetic parameters apparent activation energy, orders with respect to H2 and CO pressures did not vary after poisoning by H^S. Methane-deuterium exchange The methane exchange reaction was carried out in the temperature range 473 to 673 K. The partial pressure of methane was kept constant at 164 005 aozs Fig. 1. Changes in the CO conversion A and the selectivity S as a function of the H^S coverage (reaction temperature = 525 K, H^/CO =4). 5 torr (1 torr = 1.33.3 N m~2) after it was checked that the partial order with respect to methane pressure was constant and equal to 1.0 0.1 under the studied conditions. The partial pressure of deuterium was always fixed in order to keep the ratio Dz/CHU larger than unity. At the same time, the ratio D/H measured in the gas phase was always larger than 100. This may indicate that during exchange experiments, the dilution of the adsorbed deuterium pool by hydrogen species originating from the methane C H cleavage is nearly negligible, which prevents scrambling effects in the isotopic distribu- tions. All kinetic data were obtained under steady state conditions, at adsorption-desorption equilibrium as is required for catalytic isotopic exchange reactions [12]. No significant aging of the catalysts was detected during the reaction. Some of the experimental kinetic parameters for the exchange with respect to deuterium pressure and temperature are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Discussion The treatment of the raw exchange results has been already described in a previous paper related to methane, ethane and propane exchange on nickel catalysts [6]. Let us underline some basic points on the subject, in connection with the present study. (i) One observes that the main isotopic exchange products (CI^D and CD4 for methane) are formed according to different and unrelated kinetics. As a matter of fact, one could consider a conventional mechanism of exchange proceeding through a sole pathway as follows: ri CH4 + 2* < > CHg* + H* single-atom exchange ''-l CHa* + 2* <=^ CH2(* )2 + H* multiple-atom exchange ' -2 The symbol * represents a surface nickel atom. 11 <* CO a \"0 ^ a, e0 if0 1 - 00 -w I-i 10 .^ 11 ^ n N ^ 0 -0 1 1 u '5. a, 0 ^ 1^ ^ -< ^ 'o t )co CT 10 10 B ^ -Q u ^CA o -81 1 CO ^1 f- e ,3 >' V B a 0 8 tw \"\"OQiS Cf1 2i 5 \" g^ j 00 NID w 1 Ll EG B. ca 3 u ^ u \"3 J3 B u *j Oil A Oi s a, a \"S 1tt)S \" a 0 TO 0,ID A 0,*S \" ca a <i> Mtf Sfl eM0T-l tO CO!>'T-l -4-3 g .0) 4- /' <a) IQ-S 0 q1' be .fi 3 s \"B'-S -S 3 0 & \"S \"0 q .a ^ a a r-l c 0) 60 B C ^4 CM 0 .3ux w <u o SB'S ^\"s's^t~1 CO *-< ' ' mIN01 s . -4->a> e c< )-i 0 ^ w BJ-^ 2 1-1 ns o v H^ << ^ a a 15Is -a . >>3 3 o1ca co tDin-^i ' fio c~oo(0 ^ loiom ioio COINN <o <0i-ioi oocn ^icsit- CO CT'^'CO COCO lOtOtO t0 t^tocn o0t oowm ^i i-ii m >0i-i c-oi-'r f- ^ o co i> o co o o ii 00 00(0i-< COIN i-ltOCO CM (OiniN coi-i cooi-i t > (NOCO 100 lOCSIr-l^U tO CnoOCM ^)<i-l (OOtt- CO ^'CO'f OCO C~CM(0 o' i ' i-i od ^r' o o w i-i l-< r-1 ID ooo coo i-ioomm Tr' c~ od m w < > co <o co 00 000 0000 0 01 00) 0000 Ou T-10 r-lT-lT lr-l co ooo coco cocococo INOlr-1 CMIN IDINCMI'- 0^ O^CM O&O) 050^0)0 ,c '0 i^ k^ S 3 3 3 g w w u u u u S ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ S t0. ln <N 10 in CM Q'S OIN r-ICO-^t> I o 0 z a w 5^9 S 1 I SP Z Z 166 TABLE 2 Orders with respect to deuterium pressure and apparent activation energies for various T and PQ conditions Catalysts Reaction Deuterium rap E^ (kcal mol~1) temperature pressure -. ~.

Moreover, the possibility that CD4 arises through some kind of mass transport limitation, which would allow the initial light methane to undergo many single-atom exchanges, is ruled out in the present temperature and pressure range, for it has been shown to be non-diffusional. (ii) Only a competition for adsorption between deuterium and methane on the same sites can account for the observed inhibiting factor versus the D; pressure (most of the experimental values of/in are negative). (iii) It is inferred, in connection with Frennet et al. 's model of multiple sites [12] and the mechanism proposed by Martin for hydrogenolysis [7], that the rate of formation for each of the deuterated products is proportion- al to the probability for a light methane molecule to collide with a surface ensemble of x free-neighbor Ni atoms and y preadsorbed deuterium atoms. This leads to the equation r = feo exp(-Eo/RT)(l -B^B^P^ (1) where 6^ is the surface coverage in deuterium. In the present case, the surface coverage in hydrocarbon species 6c is assumed to be small with respect to 0n, which is consistant both with the experimental first-order kinetics versus methane pressure and with the fact that almost no methane is initially adsorbed on the catalyst when analysing the transient response of the mass spectrometer after the gas mixture admission. , 167 Values of x and y are obtained from the equation \"D,/a=y-^D/(l-0D) (2) where a is the slope of the Freundlich transform worked out from Ha adsorp- tion isotherms [6]. EQ, the true activation energy, is determined considering the Temkin equation (3) where Q^o is the isosteric heat of deuterium adsorption for the coverage corresponding to the experimental T and P conditions. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate how x, y, Q^o and Ey are worked out for the case of the Ni/SiO; 'standard' catalyst. The values of the latter parameters for the different cata- lysts are reported in Table 3. From the x and y values it can be deduced in accordance with our previous assumptions [6] that: (i) The single-atom exchange proceeds on a preadsorbed site (y = 1) according to an associative mechanism as follows: CH4 + D* + (3 - 4)* <== : |CH4D|ads(4 - 5)* <= CHyD + H* + (3 - 4)* (4) Frennet et al. [12] have shown by calculation that a nearly similar mecha- nism (at least for the left-hand part), called a 'reactive chemisorption mechanism', could imply a positive order versus the H^ (or D^} pressure. This is actually observed in the present study for the formation of CH^D (Table 2, column MQ -di). (ii) The multiple-atom exchange, mainly the formation of CD4, proceeds through a dissociative adsorption mechanism (y = 0) which implies Fig. 2.

Moreover, in accordance with theoretical models [12], only negative reaction orders versus D; pressure are observed (Table 2, n^-d^). Let us now focus on the specific behavior of each catalyst in the studied range. SMSI effect As can be seen in Tables 1 and 3, the SMSI procedure, which consists of high temperature reduction, decreases the exchange activity down to ca. 8% of the 'standard' activity but alters significantly neither the single/multi- ple atom exchange ratios nor the true kinetic parameters for each of the iso- topic products. Similarly, the 'restoration' treatment which allows recovery of ca. 50% of the initial activity leaves the other parameters unchanged. The SMSI treatment performed on identical material has been tenta- tively ascribed to a Ni Si alloying effect, on the basis of simultaneous decreases in magnetization and H; uptake [15]. The present study not only supports this assumption but allows further conclusions: the nickel portion which is not concerned with the SMSI effect retains its catalytic properties unchanged. This rules out any electronic effect of the alloy on the unalloyed nickel. The SMSI effect can then be considered for this case as a simple loss of active surface, which may be partially recovered after 0^-H^ restoration treatment. Similar observations have been made for the CO + H; reaction [16]. 169 Poisoning by H^S Considering the methanation results, it may be deduced that the reac- tion mechanism is not changed after poisoning (identical kinetic parameters). The same conclusion arises from the exchange experiments, which indicate that not only apparent but also true kinetic parameters remain constant when the nickel surface is contacted with H^S. Both results lead us to con- clude that the sulfur poisoning as performed in the present study proceeds via a loss of active surface without any change, electronic or by dilution, in the remaining active sites. This poisoning process reasonably fits the picture of a wave front dividing the catalytic bed into a completly inactive sulfided portion and an unpoisoned portion with unaffected activity/selectivity properties as described by Bartholomew et al. in [17]. Another possibility, suggested in [18], would be that the (Ni-H^S) complex forms a two- dimensional phase formed from nuclei at the surface of the nickel particle which would then be made of large inactive sulfided patches and of unperturbed free portions. Let us note, however, that these effects of non-uniform poison distribu- tion hold for very different ways of contacting the catalyst with H;S (pre- exposure followed by a vacuum treatment at 573 K or pulsed admission during the reaction). This suggests that a poisoning process leading to a random H2S coverage and thus to possible effects of geometric dilution or electronic interaction probably implies experimental methods other than the conventional ones such as those used in the present study. Copper alloying effect As for SMSI or H^S effects, Ni Cu alloying does not change the true kinetic parameters in comparison with the 'standard' nickel catalyst. This infers that the exchange mechanism is not modified (see Table 3). In con- trast, the intrinsic activity A of each of the deuterated products does not decrease linearly with respect to copper content, but follows exponential laws of the type A = Ao (1 x)\" with x = Cu/(Cu + Ni) as depicted in Fig. 4. The n values for CHyD and CD4 formation are 3 1 and 5 1, respectively. If we assume that nickel and copper surface atoms are randomly distrib- uted as postulated in [9], it may be inferred that (1 x)\" is the probability to find ensembles of n adjacent nickel atoms on the surface. Thus, the observed decreases in activity are related to a dilution effect of the active surface sites (the ensembles n) by copper atoms. In that sense, it is not surprising to find nearly similar values for parameters n and x, both of which are related to a dilution effect. If a surface enrichment in Cu had occurred, as very recently postulated by Gale and Richardson [19] in partially reduced Ni Cu catalysts, we would probably have had a much more pronounced effect of copper content on activity and a marked discrepency between values of n and x would have appeared. Our results thus reinforce our previ- ous ideas concerning the surface/bulk homogeneity of our fully reduced samples, and also confirm the larger sensitivity to a dilution effect of the mul- tiple-atom exchange in comparison with the single-atom exchange process. 170 001 Fig. 4. Variation of normalized activities (A/Ao) vs. copper content in the alloy (Cu/Cu + Ni); : CD4 formation, o: CH3D formation; the curves illustrate the mathematical func- tions (1 .x-)\" with x = Cu/Cu + Ni and n varying from 1 to 5. Potassium effects The effects of potassium addition are reported in Tables 1, 2 and 3. In Table 1 a drastic decrease in exchange activity is seen, whatever the reaction product (the remaining activity is less than 2% of the 'standard' activity for 2.5 wt.% addition of potassium). As for the previous cases, this could be due either to a loss of active surface by inactive potassium patches or to a dilu- tion effect by potassium atoms. The latter effect of dilution could account quantitatively for the observed activity decrease only if the entire amount of potassium is randomly distributed on the nickel surface. However, it has been shown unambiguously by infrared experiments reported in [10] that a significant portion of the added potassium was fixed on the silica support as an oxide, and thus could not participate in the loss of exchange activity. Moreover, the bridge-bonded character of adsorbed CO on nickel, which is observed by infrared spectroscopy [10], cannot satisfactorily accommodate a high dilution of the nickel phase by potassium atoms. Further, the CD4 formation should be more sensitive to a pure dilution effect than the forma- tion of CH3D, as noted when adding copper. Such a difference is not observed for potassium addition. Accordingly, a second effect, probably non-geometric, must be also invoked for explaining the present results. Con- sidering the 'true' kinetic parameters in Table 3, it is observed that Ey is significantly increased for CD4 formation (ca. 10 kcal mol~1) while the isosteric heat of hydrogen (or deuterium) adsorption, Qiso, is decreased (ca. 4 kcal mol\"1). The same trend also holds for CH3D formation, although to a lesser extent. A possible explanation could be to assume that potassium addition induces changes in the bonding energy between nickel and adspecies 171 such as deuterium or methane. This is in good agreement with the work of Praliaud et al. [10] where an electron transfer from potassium to nickel was proposed to account for the observed changes in bonding energy. In the present case, the Ni H bonding would be weakened on K Ni/SiOs material (due to lower heat of adsorption). As the rate-determining step for multiple- atom exchange implies a dehydrogenation of methane, the addition of K, which weakens the Ni H bond, induces a larger activation energy and a decrease in activity, as is experimentally observed. This effect can be pre- dicted to be smaller in the case of C^D formation, where the process of single-atom exchange is less dependent on the Ni H bond formation. It is difficult to speculate further on the relative importance of this electronic effect due to potassium addition as compared to the possible geometric effects. More complete data on bonding energies are necessary and other works including calorimetric experiments are now in progress. Conclusions Table 4 summarizes the tentative relations between the observed kinetic changes and the possible nature of the effects caused by catalyst modifica- tions (note the striking similarity with the results related to methanation [11, 16]). It clearly indicates how the calculation of the selectivity and the true kinetic parameters of the exchange reactions permits a distinction, at least qualitatively, between geometric and electronic effects. The point is that the high sensitivity of this reaction to the physicochemical changes of the catalyst is mainly related to the 'demanding character' of the reaction. The reaction is directly linked to the existence of specific sites (allowing dissociative or associative adsorption), their respective concentrations being TABLE 4 Nature of the effects after catalyst modification as a function of the observed kinetic changes Nature of the effect Kinetic changes Activity Selectivity True energetic parameters (single/multiple-atom (Ey, Qjso) exchange) Geometric by loss of active surface (SMSI, H,S) Geometric by dilution of the active phase (Cu alloying) Electronic and pos- sibly geometric (K addition) linear decrease constant decrease as increase (1-.X-)\" decrease decrease constant constant changed 172 mainly monitored by the surface coverage of the different adspecies, Qv. and 6c, in agreement with Frennet etal. [20]. In that sense, there is no evidence to postulate that the methane exchange reaction is also structure-sensitive, i.e. that it is related to the concentration of surface defects, as is often assumed for exchange reactions. This statement could perhaps indicate some surprising structure insensitivity of the exchange reaction, as recently pointed out for Pt and Pd/SiO; catalysts in ref. 21. References 1 J. R. H.

Mirodatos 1 Institut de Recherches sur la Catalyse, CNRS, 2 av. Albert Einstein, 69626 Villeurbanne, CédexFrance 1 Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. Exchange of methane with deuterium has been used to study the possible relations between intrinsic kinetic data (selectivity, true activation energy, active site requirements) and the changes in the supported nickel properties due to alloying, promoting or poisoning effects. Mechanistic information dealing with the formation of the main isotopic products (CH3D and CD4) are provided. The effects observed on nickel poisoned by H2S or in a SMSI state are shown to originate only from a loss of active surface. Alloying nickel with copper induces a geometric dilution effect with a modification in exchange selectivity. For nickel catalysts promoted by potassium, evidence of an electronic effect is provided considering the changes in the true activation energy of the reaction. Some comparisons with the CO + H2 reaction are also proposed. References 1 J.R.H. Ross M.C.F. Steel J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans. I 69 1973 10 2 J.R. Rostrup-Nielsen J. Catal. 31 1973 173 3 E.G.M.
