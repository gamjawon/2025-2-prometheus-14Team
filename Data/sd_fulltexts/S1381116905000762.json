It is firstly discovered that ZnCl2 modified γ-Al2O3 solid Lewis acidic catalysts (ZnCl2/γ-Al2O3), which are prepared by solid-state reaction, are very active and extremely selective for the preparation of guaiacol by the vapor phase O-methylation of catechol with methanol in a fixed-bed reactor at 553K, under the optimum reaction conditions, the conversion of catechol and the selectivity for guaiacol are up to 81.8 and 90.9%, respectively over ZnCl2 (10%)/γ-Al2O3 and by far better than the reaction results over the solid Brønsted acid catalyst (HY), proposing that the weak coordination of catechol with the Zn2+ sites of ZnCl2/γ-Al2O3 plays a key impact on the high selectivity for guaiacol. The recycling tests indicate that the modification of ZnCl2 could significantly improve the catalytic stability of γ-Al2O3 by it efficiently restraining the catalyst's coking. And the deactivation of ZnCl2/γ-Al2O3 is mainly caused by its ZnCl2 leaching and surface coking in the run procedure, therefore its catalytic activity can be only partly recovered by the calcination in air at 773K for 4h. Graphical abstract It is firstly discovered that ZnCl2 modified γ-Al2O3 (ZnCl2/γ-Al2O3) solid Lewis acid catalyst, which is prepared by solid-state reaction, is very active and extremely selective for the preparation of guaiacol by the vapor phase O-methylation of catechol with methanol in a fixed-bed reactor at 553K. Keywords ZnCl2/γ-Al2O3 Solid Lewis acid catalysts NH3-TPD\\TG-DSC Catalytic alkylation O-methylation of catechol Guaiacol 1 Introduction Oxy-alkylated benzene derivatives prepared by the O-alkylation of phenol derivatives with alkylating agents in the presence of acid or base catalysts are very important fine chemicals. For example, guaiacol, which is synthesized by the liquid or vapor phase O-methylation of catechol with methylating agents, is an important synthetic intermediate in the production of flavorings, fragrances and pharmaceuticals. Conventionally, guaiacol is synthesized by O-methylation of catechol with corrosive and toxic reagents such as dimethyl sulfate and dimethyl iodide in the presence of stoichiometric quantities of sodium hydroxide as homogeneous catalyst [1,2]. These conventional processes commonly have some defaults like the trouble separation processes, relative low atom efficiency [3], non-continuity of operation and especially serious environmental pollutions. Currently, increasing attention is drawn on studying and developing an alternative route which is more economical and environmentally friendly in order to overcome the disadvantages of homogeneous catalytic processes, e.g., continuous catalytic processes for methylation of phenol derivatives with methanol or dimethyl carbonate using solid catalysts and fixed bed reactors offer many advantages such as convenient separation of catalyst and product, catalyst reusability, ease of product-work-up and continuity of operation as well as a high atom efficiency [4]. Various solid acid catalysts such as H-ZSM-5 [5], HY [6], AlPO4/SAPO [7], Al-P-O [8], H3PO4/SiO2 [9], A12P2Ti2Si2O [10] and γ-Al2O3 [11] or base catalysts such as K/Al2O3 [12], basic X-zeolites [13,14] and alkali loaded silica [16,17] have been successfully employed to realize these continuous processes. In general, the solid Brønsted acid catalysts give low oxy-alkylated products because these stronger and larger number of acidic sites on the catalyst surface promotes more ring alkylation than side (–O) alkylation reaction [6,17,18]; While the solid base catalysts give the excellent oxy-alkylated products in the alkylation of phenol derivatives [13–17]. For example, Bal and Sivasanker [15] reported that very high conversion (90%) and 100% O-methylation selectivity were obtained over Cs-loaded silica for methylation of phenol with methanol, and proposed that the mechanism of the reaction involved the formation of a transient phenolate species on the basic O2− on the surface and the reaction with a (CH3) δ+(OH) δ− species adsorbed on the adjacent alkali ions [4]. However, in the methylation of catechol with methanol, only 75% guaiacol selectivity was obtained over Cs-loaded SiO2, this is mainly because this base catalyst could further catalyze the O-alkylation of guaiacol to produce about 16% veratrole [17]. Therefore, it is very necessary to find more efficient catalyst for highly selective mono oxy-methylation of catechol with methanol. As we have known, there is little published work on the solid Lewis acid catalysts for this reaction except for γ-Al2O3 [11]. Here, we reported the preparation and characterization of the ZnCl2 modified γ-Al2O3, and firstly explored the basic catalytic properties of these solid Lewis acid materials in the selective synthesis of guaiacol by the O-methylation of catechol with methanol in a fixed bed continuous flow micro-reactor. 2 Experimental The commercial γ-Al2O3 (the content: ≥97%, the specific surface area: 167m2 g−1, the pore volume: 1.58cm3 g−1) and NaY (Si/Al: 5.2, Crystal degree: 85.8%) supports were friendly supplied by Changling Petroleum Chemical Engineering Company of Hunan Yueyang of China. ZnCl2 modified γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by using the mechanical mixture method of γ-Al2O3 with 5–15wt.% of anhydrous ZnCl2 and activated at 823K for 2h in air. HY zeolite was prepared by the exchange of NaY with 1N NH4NO3 aqueous at 363K for 2h (the ratio of solid to liquid is 1:5, the exchange processes were repeatedly carried out three times), and then filtration, thoroughly washing with deionized water, drying at 373K for 2h, and finally calcination at 723K for 4h in air. The virtual zinc contents of ZnCl2/γ-Al2O3 samples calcined at high temperature, were measured by Varian CCD SIMUTANEOUS inductive coupled high frequency plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES); The temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) of all the samples were measured by use of CHEMDET-3000 instrument (temperature from 393 to 893K for β =12Kmin−1, He flow rate for 32mlmin−1); The specific surface area and pore volume of the samples were measured by MICROMERIPICS ASAP 2400 low temperature N2 adsorption apparatus on the basis of the china standard GB/T 5816-1995. Thermal gravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) was performed on a NETZSCH-STA409PC from 393 to 1273K with a heating rate of 10Kmin−1 in air (20mlmin−1). The vapor phase alkylation reaction was carried out in a standard flow system at atmospheric pressure. A vertical glass reactor of 15mm inner diameter filled with 10cm3 of the catalyst (20–40mesh) was used. The substrates, solution of an appropriate methanol with catechol in the molar ratio of 4:1, were introduced through the top of the reactor using a micro-pump applying the load of 0.4h−1. The alkylation reaction was carried out at 513–593K. However, at pre-chosen temperatures, after stationary equilibrium had set in (after approximately 1h), the condensed products were collected and analyzed by Agilent 1100 high performance liquid chromatography (SPD-6AV ultraviolet photometric detector λ =272nm, Eclipse XRB—C18 column (4.6mm×250mm, 5μm), eluent: methanol/water 55/45, flow rate: 0.8mlmin−1, 298K). The identification of products was carried out by GC–MS. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 NH3-TPD The temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was employed to characterize the acidities of all the ZnCl2-modified γ-Al2O3 samples. The NH3-TPD results listed in Table 1 show that the total acidities of all the ZnCl2 modified γ-Al2O3 are found to be much more higher than that of unmodified γ-Al2O3, their acidic strengths are slightly stronger than that of γ-Al2O3. Further compared to the various ZnCl2/γ-Al2O3 samples, may discover that the acidic amounts and strengths of these samples continuously increase as ZnCl2 loading increases except for ZnCl2 (15%)/γ-Al2O3, which has slightly lower acidic sites than ZnCl2 (10%)/γ-Al2O3. 3.2 ICP-AES The measured virtual zinc contents of all the ZnCl2 modified γ-Al2O3 samples by ICP-AES are about 1.06–1.92%, and by far lower than the adding quantity of ZnCl2 in the solid mixture (see Table 1). It is well known that ZnCl2 has a lower evaporation temperature, and is very easily volatile at the higher temperature. So that a large amount of ZnCl2 is evaporated and a small amount of ZnCl2 maintained inside the pore of γ-Al2O3 by solid state dispersion and ion exchange in the calcination procedure. 3.3 N2 volumetric adsorption The N2 volumetric adsorption method was employed to measure the specific surface area (S g, m2 g−1) and pore volume (PV, cm3 g−1) of γ-Al2O3 materials before and after the introduction of ZnCl2, the measured results are listed in Table 1. It may be clearly discovered that the specific surface area and pore volume of γ-Al2O3 continuously decrease as the introducing amount of ZnCl2 increases, further indicating that the ZnCl2 has been dispersed inside the pores of γ-Al2O3. 3.4 Catalytic performances The alkylation of catechol with methanol was carried out at 553K over γ-Al2O3, ZnCl2 or FeCl2-modified γ-Al2O3, and HY, the results shown in Table 2 indicates that γ-Al2O3 with lower Lewis acidic sites, itself exhibits the definite catalytic activity (49% of catechol conversion) and selectivity for guaiacol (73.9%). After the modification by ZnCl2, it becomes very active and extremely selective for this reaction, e.g., the high catechol conversion (81.8%), excellent guaiacol selectivity (90.9%) and low C-methylated products (9.0%) can be obtained over ZnCl2 (10%)/γ-Al2O3. This should be relative to the more and stronger Lewis acidic sites on ZnCl2 modified γ-Al2O3. Further compared to the ZnCl2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with different ZnCl2 loading may discover that catechol conversion and guaiacol selectivity increase with the ZnCl2 loading increasing from 5.0 to 10.0%. However, the excess of ZnCl2 loading (15%) inversely results in the slight decrease in the conversion and selectivity. Hence, ZnCl2/γ-Al2O3 with 10% of ZnCl2 loading is the optimum catalyst, which is consistent with its large number of acidic sites (see Table 1). Noteworthy, FeCl2 modified γ-Al2O3 with similar Lewis acidities to ZnCl2 modified γ-Al2O3, does not show expectant excellent catalytic performances, inversely, lower activity (56.7% of conversion), abnormal poor selectivity for guaiacol (only 60.6%) and with a concomitant significant increase in the C-methylated products (34.2%) are observed over it. In compared to the Lewis acid catalysts, HY, which mainly possesses the Brønsted acidic sites, gives very low catalytic activity and poor O-methylated selectivity (catechol conversion and guaiacol selectivity are only 11.0 and 40.4%, respectively) with a concomitant high selectivity of C-methylated products (50%). some available literatures [5,6,17–19] on the vapor phase alkylation of phenol derivatives over solid acid catalysts suggest that the stronger and larger number of Brønsted acidic sites of the catalysts is more efficient for C-alkylation than O-alkylation of phenol derivatives, our experimental result strongly supports this suggestion. 3.5 Process parameters More experiments were carried out at different reaction temperature, feed ratio (molar ratio of methanol to catechol) and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) over ZnCl2 (10%)/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. These data are presented in Tables 3 and 4 and Fig. 1 . A general trend of increasing activity with temperature and feed ratio is noticed. For example, the increase in catechol conversion is about 1.2-fold to 1.3-fold, when the temperature is increased from 513 to 593K or the feed ratio is increased from 2:1 to 4:1. With increasing space velocity, there is a continuous decrease in activity; the drop is about 23% when the space velocity is increased 5-fold (from 0.12 to 0.6h−1). However, the selectivity for guaiacol continuously decreases with concomitant continuous increases in the selectivities of subsequent O-methylated product (veratrole) and especially C-methylated products as the reaction temperature increasing or the space velocity decreasing. As a result, there are the optimum process parameters (temperature for 553K, feed ratio for 4:1 and WHSV for 0.4h−1) for obtaining the highest yield of guaiacol over ZnCl2 (10%)/γ-Al2O3. 3.6 Stability of catalyst The used lifetime of the catalyst is a very key factor in the continuous flow reaction run, and we checked the effects of time on stream on the catalytic properties of γ-Al2O3 and ZnCl2 (10%)/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for the methylation of catechol with methanol under the optimum reaction conditions. the results are presented in Figs. 2 and 3 . A similar change trend of catechol conversion with the time on stream is observed over two catalysts, namely, high catechol conversion can steadily remain about 7h over γ-Al2O3 and 30h over ZnCl2 (10%)/γ-Al2O3 in the early periodic run, then conversion dramatically decrease in the medium-stage run (from 47.5 to 20.5% in 7–10h over γ-Al2O3 and from 81 to 35% in 30–45h over ZnCl2 (10%)/γ-Al2O3), finally, remains at a lower level .The selectivity of guaiacol over the two catalysts slightly decreases with the reaction time going on, but can be basically maintained at a higher level about 73–75% over γ-Al2O3 and 87–90% over ZnCl2 (10%)/γ-Al2O3. The dramatic deactivation of two catalysts all occurred in the medium-stage run, perhaps indicates that gradually accumulating cokes on the catalysts seriously covers the catalyst's active sites and leads to the dramatic drop on the catalyst's activity in this stage. Although two catalysts all exist the deactivation, the deactivation rate of ZnCl2 modified γ-Al2O3 is obviously slower than that of γ-Al2O3, this clearly shows that the modification of ZnCl2 can not only enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity of γ-Al2O3, but also improve the stability of γ-Al2O3. 3.7 Characterization of coked catalysts In order to investigate the reasons to result in the deactivation of the catalysts in the run, the specific surface area, pore volume and surface coke deposits of the recovered γ-Al2O3 and ZnCl2 modified γ-Al2O3 catalysts after running 60h were measured by low N2 volumetric adsorption and TG-DSC methods, and compared to these of their fresh catalysts, the measured results listed in Table 5 make known that the specific surface area and pore volume of the used catalysts all decrease with a concomitant serious coking on them in the different extent, but, the coking amounts on the modified γ-Al2O3 samples with a different amounts of ZnCl2 are obviously lower than that of the unmodified γ-Al2O3, indicating that the modification of ZnCl2 can enhance the resistant-coking capacity of γ-Al2O3. A typical TG-DSC curves of the coked ZnCl2/γ-Al2O3 is presented in Fig. 4 . Two exothermic peaks near 607K (very strong and sharp) and 653K (very weak and broad) were observed in its DSC curve. The peak at 607K is attributed to the soluble cokes, which consists of diphenyl ether and its derivatives and can be eliminated by calcinations at lower temperature; while the peak at 653K is attributed to the insoluble cokes, which consists of polymers of aromatic hydrocarbons with hydrogen-deficiency or graphite-like carbons and their removal needs a higher calcined temperature [20]. 3.8 Recycling tests Following recycling experiments of γ-Al2O3 and ZnCl2 (10%)/γ-Al2O3 carried out under the optimum reaction conditions, further prove that the deactivated γ-Al2O3 could be recovered and reused many times without any loss of activity by the calcination in air at 773K for 4h (see Table 6 ), indicating that the coking on γ-Al2O3 is the only reason to result in its deactivation. However, as for ZnCl2 (10%)/γ-Al2O3, the measured zinc content, catechol conversion and guaiacol selectivity over the regenerated catalyst each time obviously decrease continuously with recycling times, finally, to near to the reaction results of γ-Al2O3. This moment, the total zinc leaching (87.6%) and the drop in catechol conversion (62.9%) after recycling the third times were very serious. This indicates that, except the coking deposits on the surface, the ZnCl2 leaching on ZnCl2/γ-Al2O3 in the run should be a more serious factor to lead to its deactivation, therefore, its activity is only partly recovered by the calcination at high temperature in air by removing the coking on its surface. The high leaching of the active component ZnCl2 may imply that ZnCl2 is mainly dispersed inside the pores of γ-Al2O3 that is lack of the cationic exchange sites, and this dispersed ZnCl2 is very easily leached by the water vapor liberated by alkylation. A continuous and significant increase in C-methylated products with recycling times is most likely that HCl produced by ZnCl2 leaching could play a significant role in C-alkylation. 3.9 Proposed reaction mechanism Traditionally, liquid or solid Brønsted acid catalysts are active in C-alkylation of phenol or its derivatives, An SN1 type reaction mechanism, which involves that a transient alkyl carbocation species is firstly formed on the H+ sites and then attacks the ring C-atom of phenol or its derivatives to produce alkyl phenol derivatives, is usually suitable for alkylation of phenol derivatives with isobutyl alcohol [21]; But, Vehi and Swamy [18] reported that the reaction of phenol with 1-propanol proceeded without skeletal isomerization of the propyl moiety over solid acid, suggesting an SN2 type mechanism, which involves that formation of a transition (C3H7) δ+(OH) δ− on the H+ sites of catalyst and reacts with phenol derivatives adsorbed the adjacent H+ sites. This SN2 type mechanism, which should be more suitable for methylation over HY than an SN1 type mechanism because formation of a transient carbocation species by methylating agents is highly unstable, is presented in Scheme 1 . As for L-acids catalyze alkylation of phenol derivatives, earlier literatures reported that aluminium phenolate [22,23] and zinc aluminate spinel [24] are active and highly selective for ortho-C-methylation of phenol, suggesting that the ortho-directing effect of the OH groups by formation of a transient complex with Lewis acid plays a key importance, but there are little successful reports about O-alkylation of mono-hydroxyl benzene derivatives. Why is ZnCl2 modified γ-Al2O3 (included γ-Al2O3 itself) Lewis acid very suitable for O-alkylation of catechol? We propose that the catechol coordinates with ZnCl2 on γ-Al2O3 giving the donor-acceptor complex 1 which is a strong Brønsted acid [22,23,25]. Following, it is reasonable to suppose that hydrogen bonding between 1 and methanol gives rise to the complex 2. This interaction has two effects: the simultaneous activation of both the methanol (by H-bonding) and the catechol (by loosening the OH bond). Finally, whether the activated methanol selects to attack the hydroxyl O atom of the catechol to form a transition complex 3 or the ring C atom of catechol to form a transition complex 4, should be dependant on the stability of the complex 1. As it is well known, the coordination ability between the Zn2+ ion and the catechol is weak, this weak coordination is more advantageous of the activated methanol further attacking its hydroxyl O atom to obtain guaiacol 5 rather than its ring C atom to obtain C-methylated products 6, and realizing the catalytic cycle of the Zn2+ sites. As a result, the high conversion and extremely excellent mono-oxy-methylated selectivity can be realized at the same time over the Zn2+ sites (see Scheme 2 ). Our proposed this SN2 type mechanism may give a reasonable explanation to the results over FeCl2/γ-Al2O3. Because a transition complex formed by the stronger coordination of Fe2+ with catechol has the better stability and the activated methanol may prefer attacking its ring C atom to its hydroxyl O atom. So that the high C-methylated selectivity is obtained over it. 4 Conclusion ZnCl2 modified γ-Al2O3 by the solid sate reaction, is very efficient solid L acid catalyst for highly selective preparing guaiacol from vapor phase O-methylated of catechol with methanol, under the optimized reaction conditions, 81.8% of catechol conversion and 90.9% of guaiacol selectivity can be obtained over ZnCl2 (10%)/γ-Al2O3, which is by far better than that over the solid B acid catalyst (HY). This is a reasonable to suppose that the weak coordination of catechol with the Zn2+ sites of ZnCl2/γ-Al2O3 plays a key impact on the high selectivity for guaiacol. In addition, the modification of ZnCl2 to γ-Al2O3 can not only enhance its catalytic activity and selectivity for guaiacol, but also improve its stability through restraining its surface coking. And the high ZnCl2 leaching and surface coking deposits of the catalyst in its run are two main reasons to result in its deactivation, this perhaps implies that ZnCl2 is mainly dispersed inside the pores of γ-Al2O3 and this dispersed ZnCl2 is very easily washed away in the reaction process.
