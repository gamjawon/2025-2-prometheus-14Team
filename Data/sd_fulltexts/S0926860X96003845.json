It has been established that reduction of the catalyst at 923 K leads to a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) and formation of a cubic NiSi-phase. This causes pronounced changes in the FTIR spectra of chemisorbed CO, both in the total intensity and in the ratio of bridged versus linear bonded CO. Oxidation at 823 K and subsequent reduction at 773 K resulted in redispersion of the metal and formation of small Ni particles with a mean diameter of 2.1 nm.

Introduction Metallic particles supported on reducible carriers like titania or niobia exhibit an important loss in the chemisorption capacity for hydrogen and carbon monoxide and a drop in catalytic activity for various reactions when reduced at temperatures higher than a critical one [1]. This phenomenon is generally referred to as the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) and is caused by different effects like electronic modification of the metallic particles, decoration of the particle surface with fragments of the partially reduced carder and formation of intermetallic * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

It was reported that exposure of a catalyst modified by SMSI to oxygen followed by hydrogen reduction at below the critical temperature, com- pletely restores the sorption properties of the catalyst [3]. Even silica, usually regarded as a fairly inert support, can interact strongly with the metal phase under appropriate conditions, e.g., Pt [4,5], Pd [6-8], Co [9]. An effect of SMSI on the catalytic activity of a Ni/SiO2 catalyst was reported by Martin and Dalmon [ 10]. Praliaud et al. [ 11 ] found evidence for the formation of a nickel-silicon alloy after reduction of a highly loaded Nilsilica catalyst at 1173 K. In a study of Ni/SiO2 model catalyst, prepared by vapor deposition of nickel on a freshly oxidized silicon film, Lamber et al. [ 12] have shown the formation of Ni3Si, after reduction in hydrogen at 850 K, for 100h. While small particles are completely converted to Ni3Si, the silicide was present together with metallic nickel in particles larger than 10 nm. In a recent publication by Fr&y et al. [13], the reduction of silica supported nickel catalyst at temperatures higher than 923 K led to a decrease in hydrogen adsorption capacity and the catalytic activity in hydrogenation reactions. Due to investigations by means of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of chemisorbed CO, magnetic measurements, X-ray diffraction and temperature programmed oxidation, these modifications are assumed to arise from the interaction between nickel and fractions of the partially reduced carrier, both in the bulk and at the surface of the metallic particles. The sol-gel synthesis of supported catalysts is increasingly studied with respect to advantages compared to carrier systems generated by impregnation or co- precipitation, i.e., better control of metal content and distribution or higher thermal stability of the metal dispersion [ 14-17]. Investigations aimed at understanding the mechanisms of the deactivation of supported metal catalysts due to sintering and interaction with the support are still missing in the literature in the case of sol-gel catalysts. In this paper, the conditions for the appearance of SMSI as well as for the regeneration of a Ni/SiO2 catalyst prepared via sol-gel synthesis will be elucidated by a combination of structure analysis by analytical electron microscopy with FFIR spectroscopy of chemisorbed carbon monoxide as a probe molecule. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials Ni/SiO2 catalysts containing 1.9 wt% Ni were prepared via sol-gel processing of Ni(OAc)E.4H20, TEOS and (EtO)aSi-(CH2)a-NHCH2CH2NH2 in ethanol under basic conditions. Then the solvent was removed at 335 K/1.60apa. The obtained solid xerogel was dried at 298 K and 10-1 Pa to remove adsorbed water and alcohol. Further details of the procedure have been described previously [14,16]. 50 mg of the catalyst were oxidized in synthetic air for 1 h to remove the T. Ueckert et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 75-85 77 organic components and then reduced in a flow of predried hydrogen (1200 1/h g- cat, Messer-Griesheim 99.999% purity) at temperatures between 773 and 923 K for 10 h in a quartz reactor under shallow bed conditions. Reoxidation of the Ni/SiO2 specimens was carried out in flowing oxygen (1200 l/h g-cat, Messer- Griesheim 99.995% purity) at 823 K in the same quartz reactor. 2.2. Electron microscopy The electron microscopy and electron diffraction study was carded out with a Philips 420T transmission electron microscope, operated at 120 kV and equipped with an energy dispersive analyzer (EDX). HRTEM examinations were performed in a Philips CM 20 Ultra Twin electron microscope operated at 200 kV. The Ni/SiO2 specimens were ground to a fine powder and dispersed ultrasonically on standard 3 mm copper grids coated with thin amorphous carbon foils. 2.3. FTIR spectroscopy of chemisorbed CO FTIR spectra of chemisorbed CO were recorded on a BioRad Frs 60 A FTIR spectrometer equipped with a heatable UHV-reaction chamber connected to a gas line. The spectra were obtained with a resolution of 2 cm-1. The externally pretreated catalyst was pressed into self-supported wafers (5 mg/cm2), mounted into the reaction chamber, outgassed and dried by evacuation over night before exposure to a static pressure of 5 102 Pa CO (Messer Griesheim, 99.995% purity) at 298 K. The evolution of the CO bands was monitored continuously until saturation. Thereafter the reaction chamber was evacuated at 298 K to a final pressure of 10-3 Pa to remove the gaseous and physically adsorbed CO. 3. Results The electron micrograph of the sample after reduction at 773 K is depicted in Fig. l(a). Small metal particles with a mean particle size of 5.5 nm are visible. The particles are homogeneously distributed over the support and exhibit a narrow gaussian shaped size distribution (Fig. 2(a)). The FTIR spectra of CO chemisorbed on Ni/SiO2 following the reduction of the catalyst precursor at different temperatures are depicted in Fig. 3 The spectrum after reduction at 773 K is typical for CO adsorbed on metallic nickel (top spectrum). Four maxima can clearly be distinguished and assigned to CO adsorbed on Ni2+ (2198 cm-1), CO linearly (2046 cm-1), bridged (1885 cm-1) and three- fold coordinated (1797 cm 1) to metallic nickel [18,19].

Reoxidation destroys the silicide phase and NiO, Ni203 and SiO2 are formed, as was proven by electron diffraction (Table 2). Subsequent reduction led to the restoration of the normal sorption properties. The FTIR spectrum of CO adsorbed on the catalyst following the regeneration (RG) is shown in Fig. 4.

The shift of the relative intensities of bridged and linear bonded CO is reversed and the original intensities established again. The peaks at lower wave numbers are slightly shifted to higher values. This regeneration is accompanied by a pronounced redispersion of the Ni. The electron micrograph of the RG sample shows that very small and homogeneous distributed particles were obtained (Fig. l(b)). The particle size distribution of the RG sample in comparison with the 773 K sample (Fig. 2) is markedly narrower - over 90% of the particles have diameters in the range 1-3 nm and the average particle size is 2.1 nm. 4. Discussion The preparation of silica-supported Ni catalysts via sol-gel processing led to the formation of very small Ni particles which are homogeneously distributed over the support. The key to control the metal particle size is the high dispersion of the metal precursor during the sol-gel step. The incorporation of the metallic particles into the silica network results in a greater thermal stability against sintering in oxidizing and reducing atmospheres compared to catalysts prepared via conven- tional preparation methods. The chemisorption of carbon monoxide indicates that metal occlusion as a result of pore plugging should play a minor role, which is in agreement with reports of other workers [15]. The pronounced changes in the FI'IR spectra accompanying the reduction and the regeneration of the catalysts can be clearly correlated with the identification of silicides and the lifting of the SMSI due to oxidative treatment, respectively. High temperature reduction (923 K) of the Ni/SiO2 catalysts prepared by sol-gel processing leads to the formation of a cubic NiSi-phase. The lattice parameter a=0.4250 nm of the NiSi particles is smaller as compared with the value of bulk NiSi (ao=0.4460 nm) [20]. The difference can be explained by the small size of the NiSi particles (3.1 nm). It is well established that the lattice parameters of small particles decrease with their size [21]. On Ni and Pd, CO occupies bridged adsorption sites to a greater extent than on Pt and Rh, which favor the coordination in atop positions. The question whether atop or bridge coordination occurs is the result of a subtle balance between the interaction of the CO 5o--orbital (which favors atop) interaction and the 27r* (which favors coordination in bridged position) with the d- and s-band of the metal [22]. Van Santen [23] concluded that the bridged position becomes more favored if: (1) the interaction with the d-valence electron bands decreases; (2) electron back- donation from metal to CO becomes strongly favored over electron donation from CO to metal; (3) the d-valence electron bands significantly deplete so that the higher interaction of the 5~r orbital with the d-band also favors the bridged position. On Ni, CO is found to favor bridged coordination because of its much weaker interaction with the d-band and low workfunction. Due to the much smaller T. Ueckert et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 75-85 83 d-bandwidth, as compared e.g. to Pt the valence d-electron orbitals are less extended and have much less overlap with adsorbate orbitals. The development of SMSI with increasing reduction temperature can be clearly recognized in the FrlR spectra even before the formation of a cubic silicide NiSi can be established by electron diffraction. It is accompanied by a marked decrease in the intensity of all absorption bands. Additionally, a clear shift of the relative intensities in favor of multiple bonded CO can be observed, i.e., a stabilization of the property of the Ni metal to favor multiple over linearly bonded CO. The constant position of the bands indicates that there is no influence of dipole-dipole interaction. These results are in agreement with the observations reported by Fr&y et al. [13] in the case of Ni/SiO2 catalyst prepared by impregnation of non-porous silica with the exception of the positions of the bands assigned to bridged and threefold coordinated CO. The positions of the bands agree when compared with the data obtained by Fr6ty et al. [ 13] following desorption of CO at 573 K and they are slightly outside the range of reported band positions as summarized by Coulter et al. [18]. An explanation at this point would be rather speculative. Electron microscopy gives no evidence for morphologies with developed (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) faces present in the samples of Coulter et al. [18]. A possible explanation of the observed, rather low, wave numbers could be adsorption on higher indexed planes. However, supporting data are scarce in the literature. It seems reasonable to assume that the changes in the chemisorption properties are due to the incorporation of reduced support fragments in the bulk even before an ordered silicide phase is established. The incorporation of silicon in the bulk would cause a reduction of the d-bandwidth due to the reduced d-d hybridization [24]. As described above this is known to affect the coordination of CO to atop positions more than to bridged adsorption sites and may be a possible explanation of the increasing ratio of bridged to linear bonded CO with increasing metal- support interaction. Possibly there is a decoration of the metal surface with partially reduced SiOx species (x<2) prior to the incorporation of silicon in the bulk. The decoration of the surface diminishes the number of adsorption sites resulting in a decrease of the total intensity of the IR spectrum. It is likely that the decoration builds up islands on the metal particles. If it dilutes the surface this should affect the bridged adsorption sites more than the ones available for linear adsorption, which is contrary to the experimental observations. The oxidative regeneration of the catalyst led to the destruction of the silicide phase and the formation of NiO, Ni203 and SiOz. Rereduction at a temperature lower than the critical temperature to induce SMSI restores the normal sorption properties of the catalyst. This is a well-known behavior in the investigation of SMSI effects reported in the literature [11]. However, this is accompanied by a redispersion of the Ni in the case of the sol-gel catalyst. Most of the studies concerning redispersion were carried out on platinum catalysts in both industrial [25,26] and model [27-30] systems. There is also evidence for redispersion in the case of Co, Fe and Ni catalysts [31-33]. 84 T. Ueckert et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 75-85 It is generally accepted that redispersion of the metal phase can be explained by (1) oxidation of metal particles and spreading of mobile metal oxides over the support [25,26,30]; (2) splitting of metal particles due to strains generated during their oxidation [27-30]. Such splitting may be supported by the oxidation of nickel-silicon compounds due to the high heat of formation of SiO2. 5. Conclusions The sol-gel synthesis provides a suitable route for the preparation of small metal particles with narrow size distribution and homogeneously distributed over the silica support. Heating the Ni/SiO2 samples prepared via sol-gel processing in hydrogen atmosphere up to 923 K leads to the formation of a silicide phase. This causes pronounced changes in the FTIR spectra of chemisorbed CO, both in the total intensity and in the ratio of bridged versus linear bonded CO. It seems that the investigation of catalysts by means of PTIR spectroscopy of chemisorbed CO is suitable to detect SMSI effects in a more incipient stage as it possible with electron diffraction techniques. A regeneration treatment of the catalyst after high tem- perature reduction removes the SMSI state and improves the dispersion of the metal phase.

Dispersion and chemical composition changes of aNi/SiO2 catalyst prepared by sol-gel processing caused by thermal treatment in hydrogen and oxygen atmospheres have been investigated by means of electron microscopy, electron diffraction and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of chemisorbed CO. It has been established that reduction of the catalyst at 923 K leads to a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) and formation of a cubic NiSi-phase. This causes pronounced changes in the FTIR spectra of chemisorbed CO, both in the total intensity and in the ratio of bridged versus linear bonded CO. Oxidation at 823 K and subsequent reduction at 773 K resulted in redispersion of the metal and formation of small Ni particles with a mean diameter of 2.1 nm.
