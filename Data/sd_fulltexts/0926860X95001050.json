Bertea, H.W. Kouwenhoven, R. Prins Laboratory for Technical Chemistry, Eidgensische Technische Hochschule, 8092 Zurich, Switzerland Received 6 March 1995; revised 23 April 1995; accepted 29 April 1995 Abstract Active and stable mordenite catalysts have been developed for the selective nitrobenzene production by vapour-phase nitration of benzene with 65 wt.-% HN03 at normal pressure and 443 K. The acidic and textural properties of commercial synthetic mordenite have been modified by different combinations of thermal and acid treatments. The physico-chemical properties of the catalysts were investigated by Z' Al and 29Si MAS-NMR, AAS, XRD, NZ and low pressure Ar adsorption. The catalytic activity and stability of the modified mordenite catalysts were strongly influenced by the amount and state of aluminium in the zeolite. Extra-framework aluminium species generated by thermal treatment at higher temperatures ( > 973 K) induced a severe catalyst deactivation. The deactivation could almost be eliminated by subsequent acid leaching with 6 N HCI, which removed the extra-framework aluminium to a large extent, thus unblocking the pores and/or pore mouths. An optimum mordenite modification procedure was developed, resulting in highly active and selective catalysts, which retained their initial activity for at least 120 h on stream.

Nitrobenzene, an important intermediate in the chemical industry, is principally converted into 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, which is used for the production of polyurethane. Traditionally, nitration is carried out in continuous isothermal or adiabatic plants, by reacting benzene with `mixed acid' under vigorous agitation, and the conversion of benzene is usually 98% or more. Mixed acid is obtained by blending 5 wt.-% nitric acid (nitrating agent) with * Corresponding author. Fax. ( + 41)16321162. 0926-860X/95/$09.50 995 Elsevier Science B.V.

The latter acts as a catalyst (formation of the active electrophilic species NOz ) and binds the water formed during the reaction. Concentrated sulphuric acid in a molar acid to benzene ratio close to unity (isothermal units) or larger (adiabatic units) is required by the process [ 1 ] . After reaction, spent sulfuric acid must be reconcentrated, which leads to corrosion problems, or neutralized, with inherent waste sulfate problems. Nitrophenolic compounds formed as by-products in the mixed acid process are highly toxic and cannot be processed by standard biological treatment because of their bactericidal properties. Traditionally nitrophenols are extracted with benzene and incinerated, which causes safety problems due to their thermal instability. Nitration of benzene in the vapour phase on zeolites would be an interesting alternative to the mixed acid process, since it avoids the use of sulfuric acid. Mordenite is a well known high-silica zeolite which has found wide application in the oil industry, mainly in the field of hydroisomerization, hydrocracking and dewaxing. One of the most interesting features of mordenite is that it can be dealuminated by several methods without critical damage to the structure, leading to a family of highly crystalline materials with tailored acidic and textural properties. The catalytic performance of modified mordenite for a particular application strongly depends on the preparation procedure, since factors like the presence of extra-framework aluminium or the formation of mesoporosity may play an important role, in addition to the framework aluminium content determining the acidity of the material. The use of the large pore zeolite mordenite as a catalyst for the vapour-phase nitration of benzene has so far been reported with commercial acidic materials such as Zeolon 900H, of the Norton Company [ 2,3 ] . However, this catalyst was found to deactivate rapidly in the first few hours on stream, reaching a rather low activity corresponding to a nitrobenzene space time yield of 0.03 g/g cat h after 20 hours. The aim of the present work is to improve the performance of synthetic mordenite for the vapour-phase nitration of benzene by specific modification, using a combination of thermal and acid treatments. The acidic and textural properties of commercial synthetic Na-mordenite have thus been gradually modified, and aluminium was removed from the zeolite framework by different methods, in order to tailor the catalytic properties of mordenite. 2. Experimental Four series of modified mordenite samples were prepared using a commercial synthetic large port Na-mordenite from CU Chemie Uetikon (PM1-Na) as the starting material, according to the general scheme given in Fig. 1. For the preparation of the first two series of catalysts, PM 1-Na was ion-exchanged to the acidic H-form by refluxing with 1 N HCl followed by a two-fold exchange with 1 M NH4N03, giving a low sodium material that was calcined at 773 K under dry L.

HM21 was prepared by the same method as HM 11, but after the second NH4N03 exchange, the wet product was calcined under selfsteaming conditions at 823 K. HM11 and HM21 were submitted to a calcination under dry conditions at 1023 resp. 973 K, leading to HM12 resp. HM22. The latter were leached with 6 N HO at refluxing conditions during 16 h, dried, and calcined at 773 K, yielding HM13 and HM23, respectively. For the preparation of the third series of catalysts, PM 1-Na was converted to the H-form by three-fold exchange with 1 N HCl under reflux, giving HM31. HM32, HM33, HM34 and HM35 were prepared starting from HM31, by subsequent calcination at 923 K under dry conditions (HM32), leaching with 6 N HCl (HM33), calcination at 923 K (HM34), and leaching with 6 N HCl (HM35). HM35 was submitted to a calcination at 973 K giving HM36, which was then leached with 6 N HO yielding HM37. The last series of modified mordenites (HM311 and HM312) was prepared by subjecting HM31 to successive treatments with 6 N HC1 under reflux for 16 h, without calcination of the resulting product. Thus, HM311 and HM312 were subjected to the same acid treatments with 1 N resp. 6 N HCl as HM33 and HM35. All the catalysts and treatments are summarized in Fig. 1. 232 L. Bertea et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 229-250 The total amounts of Si, A1 and Na were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry on a Varian SpectrAA.10 after dissolution of the samples in a HFH2S04 mixture. X-ray diffraction was used to determine the unit cell parameters using Si as an internal standard [4], and to check the structural integrity of the modified samples. The texture of the catalysts was determined by means of low pressure argon adsorption on a Micromeritics ASAP 2000M volumetric analyzer. Prior to analysis, the samples (100 mg) were degassed in vacuum (0.7 Pa) at 723 K during at least 4 hours. The adsorption isotherms were taken in liquid nitrogen (77.3 K) in the relative pressure range between 10-5 and 0.2. The data in the relative pressure range between 0.01 and 0.14 were used for the calculation of the total BET surface area. The t-plot method of Lippens and de Boer [ 5 ] was applied to calculate both the micropore volume of the catalysts and the extra-zeolitic, i.e. non-microporous surface area (ESA) by computing the adsorption data according to the HarkinsJura equation in the relative pressure range corresponding to a statistical adsorbate thickness between 0.35 and 0.5 nm. 29Si and Z'Al solid state MAS-NMR measurements were carried out on a Bruker AMX 400 to investigate the degree of framework dealumination upon the thermal and acid treatments. The presence of non structural aluminium species in the pore system of the catalysts was monitored by 2' Al MAS-NMR. Standard catalytic tests of 20 h were carried out in a fixed-bed downflow microreactor at normal pressure and 443 K to test the activity and stability of the samples. Runs up to 120 h on stream have been carried out to test the long time activity and the reproducibility of the catalytic experiments and of the catalyst preparation. The benzene WHSV was 1.0 h-', the molar HN03 to benzene ratio was 0.5, and 1.5 g of fresh catalyst (25-45 mesh) was used for each run. Most catalysts had a benzene conversion of 30-45%, allowing a comparison of the stability of the conversion over the various catalysts under severe conditions. 3. Results and discussion The mordenite particles were identified by SEM as polycrystalline aggregates of platelets of about 0.5 Am. After the modification treatments, no significant changes in the morphology of the mordenite crystallites were detected. 3.1. Elemental analysis The total Si/Al ratio and the wt.-% Na20 of the catalysts as determined by atomic absorption are reported in Table 1. The data show that the sodium content of all treated mordenites is very low, except for HM31 (0.4 wt.-% Na20) which was obtained by three-fold ion-exchange with 1 N HCI. This indicates that the sodium left after the first exchange with 1 N HCl is more efficiently removed by a two-fold G.

[ 6 ] and Thakur and Weller [ 7 ] . The total Si/Al ratio (Table 1) was strongly influenced by the differences in modification treatment of the mordenite. It increased only slightly from the value of 5.2 for the parent sodium mordenite (PM 1-Na) to about 6 after one time leaching with 1 N HCl (HM 11 and HM21) to about 7 after repeated leaching with 1 N HCl (HM31) . Leaching with 6 N HCl (16 h) after a threefold treatment with 1 N HCl (1 h) without high temperature calcination resulted in a final Si/Al ratio of about 20 (HM311) , repeating the 16 h treatment with fresh 6 N HCI on HM311 only increased the Si/Al ratio to 22 (HM312). Thus, the extent of dealumination by acid leaching alone increased with the acid concentration. However, a leveling effect of the extent of dealumination was observed when dealuminating mordenite by repeated acid leaching alone, independently from the acid concentration used during the treatments. These results clearly indicate that a significant aluminium extraction from the specific mordenite sample PM1-Na above an Si/Al of about 25-30 upon further repeated leaching with 6 N HCl is not to be expected. Much higher Si/Al ratios (between 50 and 100) were achieved with the samples modified by thermal treatments at temperatures above 873 K, and subsequently leached with 6 N HCI during 16 h. Nevertheless, a similar leveling effect as in the acid treatments was observed if the thermal and acid treatments were repeated at constant dealumination conditions, i.e. same temperature during thermal treatment 234 G. Bertea et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 229-250 and same concentration of the acid on the subsequent leaching step. Thus, thermal treatment of HM31 at 923 K and leaching of the product with 6 N HCl during 16 h resulted in a strong increase of the Si/Al ratio from 7 in HM31 to 54 in HM33, i.e. an increase in dealumination from 20 to 91% (basis PMl-Na). However, subjecting HM33 to the same combined thermal and acid treatment only increased the Si/Al ratio up to 59 in HM35 (increase from 91 to 91.5%). A further significant increase of the Si/Al ratio of HM35 could be reached upon increasing the calcination temperature from 923 up to 973 K while keeping the HCl concentration at 6 N during subsequent leaching, giving HM37 with an Si/Al ratio of 69 (increase from 91 to 93%). Thus, the extent of dealumination expressed as the SUM ratio increases with the severity of the treatment, that is with the temperature of the thermal treatment, at constant acid concentration in the subsequent leaching step. This confirms the results of Raatz et al. [ 8 ] . The large difference between the Si/Al ratios of HM37 on the one hand and of HM23 on the other hand, 69 and 96, respectively, confirms the leveling effect during dealumination. Since the last two steps in the preparation of both catalysts were exactly the same, calcination at 973 K (5 h) and subsequent leaching with 6 N HCl (16 h), the large difference in the resulting Si/Al ratios of HM37 and HM23 must be due to the Si/Al ratios of 59 and 6 of the precursors HM35 and HM21, respectively. On the other hand, the sodium content may also influence the extent of dealumination, as Chen and Smith [9] found that only H-mordenite is thermally dealuminated while Na-mordenite is not, and Bodart et al. [ 10] observed that dealumination increases with decreasing residual sodium content. However, the influence of sodium in the dealumination of HM36 and HM22 can be ruled out, since sodium was below the detection limit in both cases, and if traces of residual sodium would have been present it would be rather in HM22, since 5 treatments with 1 N resp. 6 N HCl were applied for the preparation of HM36. Furthermore, the effect of sodium on HM22 would be opposite, resulting in a lower Si/Al ratio in HM23 compared with HM37. The results indicate that mordenite dealumination depends not only on the dealuminating conditions, but also on the aluminium content in the precursor. Thus, the higher the aluminium content in a mordenite sample, the more aluminium will be removed by a thermal and acid treatment at a given temperature above about 873 K and at an acid concentration sufficiently high to remove the non structural A1 species which are formed upon the thermal treatment. 3.2. Textural properties of the catalysts The results of the low pressure argon adsorption measurements are presented in Table 1. Changes in the textural properties of mordenite upon the different acid and combined acid and thermal treatments can be monitored by analyzing the porosity (micropore volume) and the surface area (total BET and ESA) of the different samples. BET data reflect both changes in the free micropore area and the L. Bertea et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 229-250 235 development of mesoporous regions in the catalyst. Since both effects tend to counteract each other, it is difficult to interprete variations of BET surface areas in dealuminated zeolite samples. Apart from the starting sodium mordenite PM 1-Na, the total measured BET surface areas listed in Table 1 are all between 460 and 510 m2/g. The significantly lower BET surface area of PM1-Na is probably due to partial blocking of the side pockets of the main channels by sodium ions, and to the presence of some amorphous silica from the original synthesis in the pores or at the pore mouths, in accordance with the relatively high ESA found in the starting material [ 11 ] . Data determined using the t-plot method, i.e. the micropore volume and the extra-zeolitic surface area (ESA) of the catalysts, are far more sensitive to small structural changes and allow better correlations with the results obtained by other experimental techniques. The method usually applied for the determination of zeolite crystallinity is based on Xmeasurements, and consists in dividing the sum of several specific peak intensities by the respective sum found for a well crystallized sample measured under the same conditions. However, in addition to the relatively high experimental inaccuracy of the method (about 10%) , it does not take into account pore blocking. Since the latter is an important factor in catalytic zeolite applications, it is probably more useful to employ the micropore volume obtained from nitrogen or argon adsorption data and the t-plot method. By assigning an effective mordenite micropore volume of 100% to a value of 0.21 cm'/g, which is the total void volume of mordenite (both 12-and staggered 8-membered rings channels) as calculated by Breck and Grose [ 12 ] from crystallographical data, the modified mordenite samples listed in Table 2 have relative micropore volumes between 80 and 98%.

Bertea et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 229-250 treatments that would destroy other structures such as zeolite Y, reflect the exceptional stability of the mordenite framework towards acids and high temperatures. Although the BET surface areas did not show a definite trend with the treatment applied, when the ESA values were subtracted from the BET values, the resulting BET - ESA values displayed exactly the same trend as the micropore volumes shown in Table 1. This is understandable, since during the BET measurement the zeolite pores will be completely filled, and a pore volume rather than a surface area is measured. The BET measurement thus gives the sum of the micropore volume (expressed in terms of surface area) and the surface area of the mesopores. Acid leaching induced in all cases a decrease of the micropore volume, which depended on the acid concentration as well as on the aluminium content of the sample. The micropore volumes of HMI 1 and HM21, which were exchanged once with 1 N HCl during 1 h, were equal to that of HM31 (0.20 cm3/g), which was exchanged three times at the same conditions. However, a substantial decrease of the micropore volume was observed with 6 N HCl (HM31 1 versus HM31) ,owing to the deeper aluminium removal from tetrahedral lattice positions in the sample exposed to the higher HCl concentration, as shown by the Si/Al ratios in Table 1. Similarly, a strong decrease of the micropore volume upon leaching with 6 N HCl was observed if the preceding step was a high temperature treatment on a sample with a low Si/Al ratio, which produces a large amount of nonstructural aluminium (HM23 versus HM31 1) . The fact that the acid leaching induced in all cases (HM12 - HM13; HM22 - HM23; HM32 - HM33; HM34 - HM35; HM36 - HM37; HM31 - HM31 1; and HM311 - HM312) a decrease of the micropore volume suggests that the decrease is brought about by one common cause. This cannot be leaching of the nonstructural aluminium from the pores, or removal of aluminium from the zeolite framework and concomitant leaching from the pores, because in that case the micropore volume should have increased. A possible explanation could be that a partial collapse of the zeolite structure occurs, with concomitant loss or blockage of micropores, or that fissures occur in the zeolite crystals along micropores. In the latter case the micropore volume would diminish and the external surface area would increase, as observed in all six cases in which acid leaching was applied. The temperature of the thermal treatment has a significant influence on the micropore volume of the resulting samples. Up to 773-823 K the micropore volume of high aluminium containing samples (HM 11, HM21, HM31) remained almost constant at high values around 0.20 cm3/g, thus very close to the theoretical maximum value of 0.21 cm3/g. Calcination of mordenite at 923 K might be considered as a mild thermal dealumination, since although aluminium is removed from the structure (as shown by the 29Si NMR results, vide infra), no significant difference in the micropore volume was observed between HM31 and HM32. A thermal treatment at or above 973 K (severe thermal dealumination) induced a stronger decrease of the micropore volume in HM22 and HM 12, even at an already low aluminium content in the precursor, as shown in the case of HM36.

Extra-zeolitic surface area (ESA) as a function of the micropore volume, depending on the dealumination conditions. HMln; O, HM2n; A, HM3n; X, HM31n. The increase of the extra-zeolitic surface area (ESA) upon the different dealumination procedures reflects the formation of mesopores with diameters of about 5 nm in the heat and acid dealuminated samples together with some larger cavities with diameters above 10 nn in the samples dealuminated with 6 N HCl alone, as determined from mesopore size distributions, calculated using the BJH method [ 13 ] on nitrogen desorption data measured at 77.3 K in liquid nitrogen. The development of mesoporous regions in mordenite upon thermal and acid and thermal dealumination derives primarily from the presence of so-called `hydroxyl nests' [ 14], which are formed during the hydrolysis of Al-O bonds in the zeolite framework. Such OH-groups have been reported to be unstable at temperatures above 373 K, since no `hydroxyl nests' are observed at 473 K [ 15 ] . At high temperature structural defects created upon A1 extraction are partially repaired by recrystallization processes, creating mesopores in adjacent regions [ 16] . Extra-zeolitic surface area in mesopores is thus formed at the cost of the micropore volume upon aluminium extraction, to an extent depending on the dealumination conditions, as shown in Fig. 2. The catalysts prepared by calcining HM21 at 973 K and leaching the product with 6 N HCl show a linear relationship between the ESA and the micropore volume. The loss of micropore volume and the gain in extra-zeolitic surface area are large, owing to the drastic conditions applied during the first step on a high aluminium containing sample such as HM21. The samples dealuminated by mere acid treatment with 1 N resp. 6 N HCl (HM31, HM31 1 and HM312) are on the same line as those of the HM21 series, but do not reach the same maximum ESA, since no calcination at 973 K was carried out. On the other hand, calcination or acid leaching on samples with an already low A1 content such as HM35 (Si/Al=59) did not result in an increase of the ESA, probably due to recrystallization processes in the A1 deficient structure of HM36, as confirmed by a slight increase of the unit cell volume going from HM36 to HM33 (vide infra). 3.3. XRD measurements The XRD spectra of all mordenite samples indicated that no phase transformation had occurred during the dealumination procedures. Further, no significant intensity 238 L. Bertea et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 229-250 decrease was observed in either of the samples, indicating an XRD crystallinity retainment of 85-90%. The unit cell parameters a, b, c (orthorhombic crystal symmetry) and the unit cell volume of the modified mordenite samples are listed in Table 2. In contrast to zeolite Y, which has a cubic symmetry and thus only one cell parameter which is linearly correlated with the aluminium content [ 17], the unit cell parameters of mordenite vary nonlinearly with the alunium content, as observed by Olson and Rollmann on acid, and heat and acid dealuminated mordenite samples up to an Si/Al ratio of 45 [ 18 ] . A contraction of the unit cell of mordenite up to an Si/Al ratio of about 45 has been reported in several studies [9,19-21 ] as expected owing to the shorter average Si-O (0.162 nm) compared with the Al-O distance (0.175 nm) in zeolites [22]. As shown in Table 2, the unit cell parameters of the modified mordenites prepared in this study decreased upon dealumination up to an Si/Al ratio of about 54 in the heat and acid dealuminated samples (HM34), whereas no further decrease was observed above an Si/Al ratio of 20 (HM311) in the acid dealuminated samples. The unit cell volume of the parent samples HMI1, HM21, HM31 decreased quite rapidly upon aluminium extraction up to a critical Si/Al ratio. This limiting Si / A1 ratio was higher in the samples where dealumination had been carried out by the combination of thermal and acid treatments, as shown by comparing HM34 or HM 12 with HM311. Interestingly, a slight but significant increase of the unit cell volume was observed when HM22, HM34, HM36 (heat and acid dealumination) resp. HM311 (only acid dealumination) were refluxed with 6 N HCI. On the other hand, almost no change of the unit cell was observed when calcining the already highly dealuminated sample HM35 (Si/Al=59) at 973 K, whereas refluxing the product HM36 with 6 N HCl induced again a slight increase of the unit cell volume (HM37). These results suggest that nonstructural Al present in the zeolite pores might reintegrate in tetrahedral framework positions in dealuminated mordenite, as already reported by Hamdan et al. in the case of zeolite Y on the basis of NMR measurements [ 23 ] . An increase of the unit cell volume of dealuminated mordenite under the effect of steam has been observed before [ 11,16] .Dry heat treatment does not induce a reintegration of extra-framework Al (HM35 - HM36; HM33 - HM34) . Successive refluxing with 6 N HCl on the other hand mobilizes oxo/hydroxo extra-framework A1 species. These can either leave the crystallites (high A1 containing zeolite) or be reintegrated in the Al deficient framework of a heat dealuminated zeolite, and therefore increase the unit cell volume (HM36 - HM37; HM34 - HM35). 3.4. Solid state MAS-NMR measurements The 29Si MAS-NMR spectra of the modified mordenite samples are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. The 29Si NMR spectrum of as synthesized sodium mordenite PM 1-Na (with a typical Si/Al ratio of about 5) is characterized by three relatively broad peaks at about -100 (very small peak intensity), -106 and -112 ppm L. Bertea et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 229-250 239 (Fig. 3) . These peaks correspond to the three types of structural environments found in as synthesized mordenite, i.e. Si04 tetrahedra with resp. 2, 1 and 0 aluminium atoms as next nearest neighbours, conventionally indicated as Si (n Al) sites with n = 2, 1 or 0 [ 24 ] . Dealumination of the mordenite framework can be followed in the 29Si NMR spectra shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, by the decrease and disappearance of the peaks corresponding to Si (n Al) environments with n > 1, and the increase of the Si (0 Al) peak intensity. The signal corresponding to Si (2 Al) was only clearly observ- PM1-Na HM11 HM12 HM13 HM21 HM22A HM23 731 711 H11312 -95 -105 -115 -125 -95 -105 -115 -125 -95 -105 -115 -125 IPPm1 [PPM] Ippml Fig. 3.

Bertea et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 229-250 able in the parent sodium mordenite PM 1-Na, and disappeared almost completely upon a three-fold exchange with 1 N HCl (HM31) . In all other samples no Si ( 2 Al) signal could be observed. The high efficiency of heat in extracting aluminium from the structure of mordenite is clearly shown by comparing the 29Si NMR spectra of HM12 (calcined at 1023 K) and HM22 (calcined at 973 K) with those of HM311 and HM312, obtained by mere acid leaching with 6 N HCl without calcination. Indeed, only a weak Si (1 Al) signal can be observed in the spectra of HM 12 and HM22, whereas Si (1 Al) sites are clearly present in HM311 and HM312, as indicated by the small and broad peak at about -105 ppm (Fig. 3) . In addition to the variation of the peak intensity of the different Si (n Al) sites upon dealumination, a splitting of the Si (0 Al) peak was observed in the 29Si NMR spectra of the most highly dealuminated samples (best developed in HM 13, HM23 and HM37). The three sharp Si (0 Al) signals in HM37 have an intensity ratio of 2:1:3, due to the presence of four crystallographically inequivalent Si positions in mordenite, with the population ratio 2T, : l T4: (2T2 + 1 T3) [ 24 ] . The resolution of the peaks is lower in the presence of aluminium, resulting in the typical rather broad Si (n Al) bands in undealuminated H-mordenite. Interestingly, not only structural aluminium prevents the splitting of the Si (0 Al) NMR signal of mordenite, but also extra-framework aluminium species present in the zeolite voids, as shown by comparison of the 29Si NMR spectrum of HM33 (Si/Al=54) where splitting can just be noticed, with that of HMI 2 and HM22 (Si /Al about 100) , where no splitting is observed. Only upon leaching of HM12 and HM22 with 6 N HCl a splitting of the Si (0 Al) signal appears in the spectrum of HM 13 and HM23 (Fig. 3) . In fact, HM33 contains more framework aluminium than HM22, since the Si (1 Al) peak is clearly visible in the z9Si NMR spectrum of HM33 and not in the spectrum of HM22, which on the other hand contains much more extra-framework A1 species owing to the calcination treatment at 973 K. HM33 was instead leached with 6 N HCl during the last preparation step, extracting most of the extra-framework Al from the pores, as confirmed by 2'Al NMR measurements shown later in this section. Similarly, the z9Si NMR spectra of the dealuminated mordenite catalysts prepared from HM31 by combined heat and acid treatments (HM31 series) shown in Fig. 4 present a gradual increase of the relative Si (0 Al) peak intensity upon aluminium removal, followed by a gradual splitting of the Si (0 Al) signal, resulting in three sharp signals in the spectrum of HM37. The splitting is better resolved in the 29Si NMR spectrum of HM37 than in that of HM23, although the SUM ratio of the latter sample is higher (96) than the one of HM37 (69) . HM23 was prepared from HM21 in only two steps, i.e. calcination at 973 K and leaching with 6 N HCl. Thus, it is to be expected that the large amount of aluminium thermally extracted from HM21 (with an Si/Al ratio of 6) has not been completely removed by the subsequent leaching step. This confirms that not only structural A1 but also extra-framework aluminium prevents the splitting of the Si (0 Al) z9Si NMR signal in mordenite. L. Bertea et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 229-250 241 Since the peak intensities of the 29Si NMR signals corresponding to the different Si (n Al) sites are proportional to the number of such T-sites in the zeolite structure, it is in principle possible to calculate the framework Si/Al ratio according to the equation proposed by Engelhardt et al. [ 25 ] Si/Al = .X1.X0.25.n.1n where In is the intensity of the Si (n Al) peak. The equation is based on the assumption that no Al-O-Al linkings are present in the zeolite framework (Lenstein's rule [26] ), and that no overlap of the Si (1 Al) peak with silanol signals due to defects occurs, which is often the case in dealuminated samples. The framework Si/Al ratios of the modified mordenites calculated from the 29Si NMR spectra by using the above equation are listed in Table 1. Since overlap of SiOH and Si (1 Al) signals was not considered in the calculation, the numbers in Table 1 represent a lower limit of the Si/Al ratio. The equation could be used up to a framework Si/Al ratio of about 80. On further dealumination, the Si (1 Al) peak almost completely disappeared and the accuracy of the Si/Al ratio became very low. Thus, only qualitative information on the Si/Al ratio can be obtained from the z9Si NMR spectra on further dealumination. Improved resolution of the three Si (0 Al) signals (HM37 in Fig. 4) points, for instance, to less aluminium. CP Z9Si MAS-NMR measurements showed that all H-mordenite samples contained SiOH groups, even HM12, which was calcined at 1023 K, data for some samples are presented in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. The character of these SiOH groups is a subject of further studies. The 2'Al MAS-NMR spectra of the modified mordenite samples are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8.

The spectra of HM 11, HM21 and HM31 ( Fig. 7 ) show a gradual increase of the relative peak intensity at 0 ppm due to octahedral non-framework Al, corresponding to the increasing severity of the conditions during their preparation. The sequence of spectra of HM31, HM311 and HM312 (only acid leaching without calcination) in Fig. 7 gives information on the dealuminating effect of the HCl concentration. As shown by the relatively high peak at 0 ppm in the spectrum of HM31 (Fig. 7), 1 N HCl is sufficiently reactive to extract aluminium from the mordenite crystal structure of PM1-Na (framework Si/Al goes from 5 to 8, cf. Table 1), but about 10% of the formed hydrated (peak broadening) octahedral aluminium remains within the pores of HM31. On the other hand, leaching with 6 N HCl (HM311, HM312) not only extracts more A1 from tetrahedral sites, but also removes the octahedral extra-framework A1 species from the mordenite pores to a larger extent, as indicated by the much smaller peak at 0 ppm in HM312. From the spectra of HM32 ( Fig. 8 ) , HM 12 and HM22 ( Fig. 7 ) it appears that dealumination of mordenite by heat is not only quantitatively ( resulting in a higher Si/Al ratio), but also qualitatively different from acid treatment alone, since different extra-framework A1 species are formed during the two processes. Thus, the 2'Al spectra of low Si/Al mordenite calcined above 873 K present a shoulder or peak at about 35 ppm in addition to the two peaks at 55 and 0 ppm observed in acid dealuminated samples and in thermally dealuminated samples which were subsequently submitted to acid leaching with 6 N HCl ( HM23, HM33 in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8). The intensity of the additional peak at 35 ppm shows a strong temperature dependence. Up to a calcination temperature of 823 K (HM21) no peak at 35 ppm was observed, whereas after a calcination at 923 K (HM32) a peak between 55 and 0 ppm is clearly visible. Upon increasing the calcination temperature to 973 K (HM22), the 35 ppm peak intensity increases to its maximum level, whereas at 244 L. Bertea et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 229-250 1023 K (HM12) the peak is again small. Leaching the products with 6 N HCl almost eliminates the peak at 35 ppm (HM33, HM23) and drastically decreases the peak at 0 ppm due to octahedral nonframework Al. Interestingly, calcination of HM33 at the same temperature as used for the preparation of HM32 (923 K) that shows a peak at 35 ppm, did not restore any signal at 35 ppm in the spectrum of HM34 although the peak intensity at 0 ppm was slightly increased, indicating further Al extraction from tetrahedral framework positions. As in heat-treated mordenite, a peak at 35 ppm is observed in the 2' Al NMR spectrum of steamed Y zeolites [ 27,28 ] , and in transition aluminas obtained by thermal treatment of very small (size effect) boehmite crystallites [ 29 ] . The peak is still subject to controversy, since it has been assigned to pentacoordinated [ 2729] , but also to tetrahedral nonframework aluminium [ 30] . However, a similar temperature dependence of the Al NMR peak at 35 ppm of the heat dealuminated mordenites (Fig. 7 and Fig. 8) was observed with heat-treated boehmite [ 29 ] , where the peak intensity increased upon treatment up to 873 K, but disappeared at 1073 K. These results strongly suggest that the extra-framework A1203 formed in fresh H-mordenite upon thermal dealumination is highly dispersed and that the coordination of A1 is like that in y-A1203. These A1203 aggregates are stable up to 1023 K and can be removed from the pores by leaching with 6 N HCl. The comparison of the z' Al NMR spectra of the highly dealuminated samples HM37 (Si/Al = 69) and HM23 (Si / Al = 96) in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 with the respective 29Si NMR spectra of the samples demonstrates the higher intrinsic sensitivity of Z'Al NMR, where the very low concentration of framework Al still gives a sharp peak at 55 ppm, whereas no Si (1 Al) signal was detected by 29Si NMR. However, quantitative analysis of Z'Al NMR spectra requires the critical assumption that all A1 is detected in the spectrum. Moreover, baseline curvature and the additional peak at 35 ppm in some dealuminated samples further complicate the quantitative interpretation of 2'Al NMR spectra, and make it difficult to calculate the framework Si/Al ratio from the 2' Al spectra [24]. 3.5. Vapour-phase nitration experiments The results of the benzene nitration experiments at 3 and 20 h on stream are listed in Table 3. The nitrobenzene yield is based on molar HN03 input, and the HN03 selectivity on the reacted HN03. The benzene selectivity to nitrobenzene was always higher than 99.5%, the only by-product being traces of dinitrobenzene. Nitrophenols were not detected in the reaction product, and their concentration was lower than 0.1 %. The HN03 selectivity was between 80 and 100%, owing to partial thermal and/or catalytic decomposition into nitrogen oxides. The NO, resulting from HN03 decomposition was not analyzed. The carrier gas used during all benzene vapour-phase nitration experiments presented in Table 3 was nitrogen. The activity of non-dealuminated low sodium H-mordenites, such as HM 11 and HM21 having a Si /Al ratio of about 6, was relatively high (69% nitrobenzene yield L.

The deactivating effect of sodium is clearly shown in the lower activity (65% yield) of HM31, which contained 0.4 wt.-% Na20. The lower HN03 selectivity observed for HM31 (78%) compared to HM 11 (85%) might also be due to the residual sodium in HM31. Therefore, the exchange procedure used for the preparation of HM 11 and HM21, i.e. subsequent exchange with 1 N HCl and 1 M NH4N03, yields a more active low SUM H-mordenite catalyst than repeated exchange with 1 N HCI. The experimental results listed in Table 3 show that the activity and stability of modified low sodium mordenite catalysts are strongly influenced by the dealumination procedure, and thus by the amount and state (framework or extra-framework) of the aluminium in the samples. The effect of repeated leaching with 6 N HCl without calcination is illustrated by the results obtained with the catalyst series HM31, HM311 and HM312 (Table 3) . The activity of HM31 (66% nitrobenzene yield after 3 h) was increased somewhat by leaching with 6 N HCl (HM311, 68% nitrobenzene yield) presumably due to the removal of the remaining sodium from HM31. As a result of a repeated treatment with fresh 6 N HCl the Si/Al ratio increased from 20 (HM311) to 22 (HM312) , and the catalytic activity did not change. The activities of the non heattreated samples HMI I, HM21, HM311 and HM321 were about equal, although the A1 content of the latter two was only about 30% of that of the former. The samples dealuminated by treatment with HCl without any further calcination (HM31, HM31 1 and HM312) exhibited an increased formation of dinitrobenzene 246 G.

This is presumably due to subtle differences in surface configuration compared to the calcined materials. The influence of the calcination temperature on the catalytic performance of Hmordenite is illustrated by comparing catalysts HM 11, HM21, HM32, HM22 and HM12, which were prepared by subjecting low Si/Al NH4-or H-mordenite to calcination at 773, 823, 923, 973, and 1023 K, respectively (see Fig. 1) . As shown in Fig. 9, during an experiment, no significant decrease in activity is observed for the catalysts calcined up to 823 K. At 923 K some deactivation occurs, as can be seen from the yield profile of HM32 in Fig. 9. High temperature calcination of Hmordenite had a drastic effect on both catalyst activity and catalytic stability. Calcination of HM 11 at 1023 K decreased the activity at 3 h on stream by a factor of 10, down to 7% nitrobenzene yield. Moreover, whereas the activity of HMI 1 did not significantly change during the experiment, HM 12 strongly deactivated, reaching 2% nitrobenzene yield after 20 h on stream. The strong decrease of the catalytic activity during one experiment of heat-treated H-mordenite is not the result of an irreversible structural modification due to the effect of the reagents used during benzene vapour-phase nitration on the catalyst. It was found that the spent HM12 catalyst could be reactivated by a 3 h calcination at 773 K. The reactivated catalyst (HM12R) was tested at the same conditions, and its activity profile (both the initial and the long time activity) was exactly the same as that of HM12, demonstrating that the deactivation of HM12 is completely reversible. Furthermore, the experiment showed that thermal decomposition of HN03 at reaction conditions was negligible. After reaction, the spent HM 12 was light yellow and contained about 12 wt.-% of reaction products, as determined by thermogravimetric analysis in air. The adsorbed products evolved at a temperature below 673 K, which was in the same temperature range where a sample of dealuminated mordenite, impregnated with 10 wt.-% of a mixture of nitro-and m-dinitrobenzene, lost the adsorbed material. L. Bertea et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 229-250 247 Therefore, the spent mordenite catalysts probably did not contain coke, since in that case the maximum temperature of the corresponding TG peak would have been substantially higher. The effect of a high temperature calcination on catalytic performance was not due to a loss in crystallinity, since the crystallinities of HM II and HM 12 were equal according to the XRD spectra. The z9Si and 2'Al NMR spectra clearly showed that substantial aluminium removal from the mordenite framework had occurred upon heating HM 11 at 1023 K (Fig. 4 and Fig. 8). The presence of a large concentration of extra-framework Al species was demonstrated by the strong 2' Al NMR peak at 0 ppm (octahedral extra-framework Al), together with a peak at 35 ppm, assigned to either 5-or 4-coordinated extra-framework Al species. The thermal dealumination treatment of HM 11 at 1023 K was repeated at a somewhat lower temperature (973 K) on HM21, which was prepared using the same procedure as for HM 11 with a calcination at 823 K. The latter had no effect on the catalytic performance, as shown in Table 3 (HM21 versus HMI 1) . The calcination at 973 K induced a marked catalytic deactivation in HM22 as discussed above for HM 12 (Fig. 9) , but to a lesser extent owing to the 50 K lower calcination temperature. The extra-framework Al included in HM 12 and HM22 (Z'Al NMR) was almost completely removed by subsequent leaching with 6 N HCl under reflux during 16 h, resulting in HM13 and HM23, respectively. The consequence was an increase of the catalytic activity (75% nitrobenzene yield at 3 h on stream) and of the catalytic stability, corresponding to an activity decrease of only 1 and 3.5% after 20 h on stream (Table 3) . Interestingly, although HM 12 presents an almost unchanged XRD profile and a quite high micropore volume of 0.182 cm3/g (somewhat higher than HM23, with 0.169 cm3/g), its catalytic performance after 20 h on stream is comparable with the non-catalytic activity observed over glasswool or quartz sand at the same experimental conditions, proving that it is indispensable to effect an almost complete removal of the extra-framework Al species, formed upon high temperature treatment, from the mordenite pore system. The removal of extraframework Al species from the pores of heat-treated mordenite by subsequent acid leaching with a strong mineral acid such as 6 N HO results in a very high catalytic activity and stability of this zeolite for the selective vapour-phase nitration of benzene. The presence of extra-framework Al species in the mordenite pores appears accordingly to be the most probable cause of the strong catalytic deactivation of HM 12 and HM22. The catalysts prepared from HM 11 and HM21 by calcination at 1023 and 973 K, respectively, and subsequent leaching with 6 N HCl on the one hand, and the catalysts obtained from HM31 by mere acid leaching with 6 N HCl on the other hand may be considered to originate from the two most extreme preparation techniques. In fact, both the physico-chemical and the catalytic properties reflect these extremes, as the acid dealuminated catalysts show a lower activity (68.5%) and selectivity compared with the highly dealuminated HM 13 and HM23 catalysts with 248 L. Bertea et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 229-250 an initial nitrobenzene yield of 75%. However, in spite of a very high bulk Si/Al ratio of 96 (HM23) and 76 (HM 13), these samples are less active than HM33-37, which is probably due to a small amount of residual extra-framework A1 left in the pore system or at the pore openings (migration of extra-framework A1 at high temperature) of HM13 and HM23. The high Si/Al ratio of the latter two was namely reached in only two steps, the first step (calcination at 973 K or 1023 K) extracting more than 80% of the framework A1 from their precursors, HM 11 and HM21 (Si/Al = 6) . The extra-framework Al, being located in the one-dimensional pores of the catalyst and partially polymerized owing to the high temperature treatment, was solubilized and transported out of the zeolite pores by leaching with 6 N HCI to a large extent, but not completely. Thus, the optimum way to prepare modified mordenite catalysts for benzene vapour-phase nitration was the one applied in the preparation of HM35 and HM37. In principle the method was the same as the one used in the case of HM21 and HM23, i.e. a combination of heat and acid treatments. On the other hand, the calcination temperature was 923 K, which was sufficiently high to effect a significant framework dealumination, but not too high, so that the framework Al could be extracted in relatively small portions and in a less polymerized (and thus more soluble) state. The single portions of extra-framework Al could be almost completely removed by 6 N HCI, before a new portion of framework A1 was extracted by a subsequent calcination at 923 K. As can be seen in Table 3, a very high (76% nitrobenzene yield) and stable activity was achieved on HM35 (Si/Al= 59), since almost no extra-framework A1 was left in the catalyst pores. For the preparation of a further dealuminated sample starting from HM35, the same procedure (high temperature calcination at 973 K and leaching with 6 N HCl) was used as applied on HM21. Although the resulting HM37 deactivated slightly during a 20 h test (2% deactivation) it had a better performance than HM23 owing to the already very low A1 content in the parent HM 12 sample, so that the extracted A1 could be removed better by 6 N HCl. The preparation of the mordenite catalyst HM35 was repeated in order to test the reproducibility of the modification procedure. The resulting HM35b catalyst was tested for benzene nitration activity and selectivity at the same conditions. In addition a long time experiment of 120 h time was carried out with HM35, to further test its operational stability and the reproducibility of the catalytic testing procedure. The results showed the exceptional operational stability of HM35, which had an almost constant conversion over 100 h on stream, at a high activity corresponding to a space time yield of 0.6 kg nitrobenzene per kg catalyst per hour. The selectivity of benzene was 99.8% (traces of dinitrobenzene), and the selectivity of HN03 was 95%. The reproducibility of both the experiments and of the catalyst preparation procedure was quite high, indicating that under the prevalent conditions mordenite is a good catalyst for the vapour-phase nitration of benzene. L. Bertea et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 229-250 249 4. Conclusion Dealumination of synthetic mordenite by heat and acid treatments, which drastically reduce the framework as well as the non-framework aluminium content, results in highly active and stable catalysts for the vapour-phase nitration of benzene with 65 wt.-% HN03 at 443 K and atmospheric pressure [31,32]. The modified mordenite catalysts prepared under specific conditions yield nitrobenzene at very high benzene (99.7% + ) and nitric acid (between 80 and 100%) selectivity, while retaining a stable catalytic activity (up to 80% nitrobenzene yield based on HN03 ) during more than 120 h on stream, corresponding to a total nitrobenzene yield of 70 kg/kg catalyst. Within the range of framework Si/Al ratios (6-> 100) investigated by us, catalyst performance increased with the framework Si/Al ratio. Further, it has been shown on the basis of standard physico-chemical methods and catalytic tests that small amounts of non-structural aluminium extracted from the zeolite framework upon thermal treatment above 873 K may restrict the pore system of mordenite and thus hinder the diffusion of dinitrobenzene molecules formed as by-product, resulting in a fast catalytic deactivation within the first hours on stream. The non-framework Al can be removed almost completely from the mordenite pores by leaching with 6 N HCI, provided that the A1 has been thermally extracted from the zeolite framework in subsequent portions at an intermediate calcination temperature of about 923 K.

Active and stable mordenite catalysts have been developed for the selective nitrobenzene production by vapour-phase nitration of benzene with 65 wt.-% HNO3 at normal pressure and 443 K. The acidic and textural properties of commercial synthetic mordenite have been modified by different combinations of thermal and acid treatments. The physico-chemical properties of the catalysts were investigated by27Al and29Si MAS-NMR, AAS, XRD, N2 and low pressure Ar adsorption. The catalytic activity and stability of the modified mordenite catalysts were strongly influenced by the amount and state of aluminium in the zeolite. Extra-framework aluminium species generated by thermal treatment at higher temperatures (≥973 K) induced a severe catalyst deactivation. The deactivation could almost be eliminated by subsequent acid leaching with 6 N HCl, which removed the extra-framework aluminium to a large extent, thus unblocking the pores and/or pore mouths. An optimum mordenite modification procedure was developed, resulting in highly active and selective catalysts, which retained their initial activity for at least 120 h on stream.
