Noels** Laboratory of Macromolecular Chemistry and Organic Catalysis, University of Liege, Sart Tilman (B.6), B-4000 Liege (Belgium) Eric Saive and Andre J. Hubert Laboratory of Organic Synthesis and Catalysis, University of Liege, Sart Tilman (B.6), B-4000 Liege (Belgium) Abstract Addition of catalytic amounts of diazoesters to various ruthenium complexes, including some diruthenium(II,II) tetrakis carboxylates, led to new catalyst systems that promoted the ROMP not only of norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene) but also of cyclooctene and cyclopentene. The conversion and the cis content of the polymers varied widely and depended on the nature of the catalyst precursor. Introduction It has been demonstrated that olefin metathesis reactions are propagated by metal-carbene complexes [1, 2]. Among the variety of such complexes synthesized so far [3-7], only those associated with Group IV-VI metals in a relatively high oxidation state promote efficient olefin metathesis in homogeneous solution [4-7]. Notable exceptions to that observation can be found with complexes based on Group VIII metals, especially ruthenium. For example, RuXz(PPh3)3, RuHX(PPh3)3 (X = Cl, OCOCF3), RuC12L (L = C,H6, 1,5CsH12 or bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene) and complexes prepared by heating RuC13 with cycloocta-1,5-diene and bicyclo[2.2.1]kept-2-ene (norbornene) in ethanol are known to initiate the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornene in homogeneous solution [1, 8]. The nature and mechanism of formation of the initial metal-carbene species remain, however, speculative in most cases. By contrast, many other ruthenium complexes and, inter alia, diruthenium(I1,I1) tetracarboxylates (acetate, pivalate, benzoate and trifluoroacetate) [9] are inactive for promoting ROMP in nonalcoholic media, even in the presence of various Lewis acids [10]. *Research Associate of the National Fund for Scientific Research (F.N.R.S.), Belgium. \"Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 U 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved 124 Experimental The ruthenium complexes were prepared according to literature procedures [9]. Cyclopentene and cyclooctene were purchased from Janssen Chimica and distilled from CaH2 under nitrogen prior to use. Norbornene was used as received. Chlorobenzene (solvent) and the diazoesters were distilled under vacuum and kept under nitrogen. Ethyl diazoacetate was purchased from Aldrich, and methyl diazoacetate and t-butyl diazoacetate were prepared according to the procedure described in [11]. Most manipulations were carried out under air with purified reactants. However, it was repeatedly confirmed that nearly identical results were obtained when the reactions were carried out under nitrogen. Instrumentation NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM 400 (400.135 MHz (1H) and 100.614 MHz (13C)). The spectra of the polymers were compared with the data in the literature [1]. The FT-111 spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer 1720X spectrometer (2 cm-1 resolution), and the gel permeation chromatographic analyses were carried out on an HP 1090 liquid chromatograph equipped with an HP 1037A refractive index detector and a battery of 4 PL gel columns for organic GPC fitted in series (particle size, 5 ,um; pore sizes, 100 000, 1000, 500 and 100 A), calibrated with polystyrene (molecular weights not corrected). The VPC analyses were carried out on Perkin-Elmer chromatographs, a Perkin-Elmer 8420, equipped with a 25 m x 0.32 mm capillary column, FFAP-CB (WCOT), and a Perkin-Elmer 8500, FT-IR coupled, equipped with a 30 m x 0.32 mm capillary column, polydimethylsiloxane-CB (WCOT). The cyclopropanes and carbene dimers were identified by GC/FT-IR and by comparison with authentic samples. Typical procedure for the polymerization of norbornene Ethyl diazoacetate (NZCHCOZC2H5, 0.042 mmol), diluted in 2 ml of chlorobenzene, was added via a precision syringe to a solution of norbornene (2.5 g, 26.5 mmol) in chlorobenzene (30 ml) containing 0.04 mmol of the ruthenium complex. The solution was kept for 3 h at 60 C. The polymerization reaction was monitored by GC using cyclohexane as the internal standard (see Fig. 1). After two precipitations from chlorobenzene in methanol (technical, 700 ml), the polymer was dried under vacuum and characterized by GPC, IR, 1H and 13C NMR. Typical procedure for the polymerization /cyclopropanation of cyclooctene Ethyl diazoacetate (2 mmol), diluted in 1 ml of cyclooctene, was slowly added over a 4 h period via an automatic syringe to neat, magnetically stirred cyclooctene (3 ml, 23 mmol) containing the ruthenium complex (0.015 mmol) at 60 C. After the solution cooled to room temperature, an aliquot was withdrawn for GC analysis. The polymers were then precipitated twice in methanol and dried under vacuum before analysis. 125 100 d c c 90 o a 0 z 80 70 60 50~ 10 0 0 4 8 20 24 Time / h Fig. 1.

Results and discussion We report here that a variety of ruthenium complexes, including diruthenium tetracarboxylates, can readily be activated toward olefin metathesis by addition of a diazoester (a carbene precursor), a straightforward method that presumably yields the active metal-carbene species in situ. Polymerization of norbornene Under the typical conditions described in Experimental, the diruthenium tetracarboxylates of weak organic acids (acetate, pivalate and benzoate) showed poor activity for the polymerization of norbornene (Fig. 1), even in the presence of higher amounts of ethyl diazoacetate. By contrast, with ruthenium(II) trifluoroacetate* and with the monoruthenium complexes listed in Table 1, the polymerizations were fast, whether the reactions were carried out under air or an inert atmosphere. Surprisingly, the conversions were limited with most of the catalysts, except with *Ruthenium trifluoroacetate was synthesized by ligand exchange between Ru2(OAc)4 and CF3COOH in excess; see, for instance, [12].

Remarkably, it appeared from the 13C NMR spectra of the polynorbornenes that a high cis content (Q,) was produced only with the diruthenium core, in sharp contrast with what is generally observed with other Ru-based catalysts [13]. It is, however, not clear if the relative amount of the cis fraction is related to steric effects associated with the bimolecular bridged structure of the complex (if preserved) or to the more polar character of the active species, as proposed by Hamilton et al. [14]. Moreover, rtr, (rt = tt/tc and r, = cc/ct) was found to be close to 3, indicating a tendency toward a blocky distribution [1]. In all cases, the polydispersity index Mw/M was higher than 2. The polydispersity increased, while M decreased, with reaction time (Fig. 2). The cis content of the polymer remained unchanged. Polymerization of cyclooctene So far, no ruthenium-based catalyst has been reported to be active for promoting the ROMP of the less strained cyclooctene and cyclopentene.

However, the polymers were not fully characterized (no 13C NMR, inter alia), and cyclooctene did not polymerize under the same conditions. In the absence of solvent, [(p-cymene)RuC12]2, ruthenium(II) trifluoroacetate and the phosphine-substituted complexes listed in Table 2 promoted the ROMP of cyclooctene and cyclopentene when activated by the addition of diazoesters. The properties of the various catalysts and the characteristics of the resulting polymers are summarized in Table 2 for cyclooctene. With most of those catalysts, continuous addition of the diazoester was needed in order to sustain the polymerization. The polymerizations were then competitive with the cyclopropanation of the double bonds of the cycloolefins (carbene transfer), as indicated in the proposed catalytic cycle of Scheme 1. Indeed, if a common species is responsible for both reactions, the formation of cyclopropanes is a chaintermination step in the metathesis reaction and the catalyst should be short lived [16]. However, the tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) substituted complex, (p-cymene)RuCl2(PCy3), seemed to promote only metathesis reactions (no cyclopropanes observed), and as a consequence, addition of only a catalytic amount of the diazoester was necessary (Table 2, entry 7). So far, this particular system has proved to be the most active catalyst for the ROMP of cyclooctene. Comparison with the other ruthenium complexes of Table 2 illustrates the clear-cut effects brought about by ligand modifications, e.g., ruthenium(II) trifluoroacetate proved to be an excellent cyclopropanation catalyst, promoting quite clean reactions, with an exceptionally high endo/exo isomer ratio. Moreover, practically no carbene dimers (diethyl maleate and fumarate) were then formed, in contrast to observations made with the other catalysts.

'Addition of 0.10 mmol of ethyl diazoacetate; react. time, 10 min. 130 Preliminary experiments indicated that cyclopentene under similar experimental conditions (T = 40 C) also polymerized. Again, ROMP was observed to be competitive with cyclopropanation reactions. With norbornene, as well as with the other cycloolefins, the presence of both ethyl diazoacetate and the ruthenium complex was necessary for promoting the catalytic activity. In all cases, fast and quantitative evolution of nitrogen was observed after addition of the diazo compound. (p-Cymene)RuCl2(PCy3) was observed to be active for polymerizing norbornene. However, the catalytic activity of this latter complex greatly increased after addition of the diazoester. We have previously reported [ 16] that addition of ethyl diazoacetate to a mixture of styrene and norbornene containing a catalytic amount of ruthenium(II) acetate competitively promoted both the cyclopropanation and a selective crossmetathesis of the olefins. According to the general mechanism of the reactions of diazo compounds catalysed by transition-metal complexes [17], a metal-carbene (-alkene) complex is assumed to be readily generated in situ by ruthenium-trifluoroacetate-catalysed decomposition of ethyl diazoacetate (Scheme 1). This metal-carbene (-alkene) complex would then initiate the ring-opening polymerization of the cycloolefins.* The intermediacy of an initial metal-carbene ester species was supported by the presence of a weak absorption around 1720 cm-1 in the FT-IR spectra of the purified polymers (chain ends). That this absorption really corresponded to the carbonyl stretch of a conjugated ester group was checked by varying the nature of the ester residue and observing the corresponding frequency shifts: chain end -C02Me, v = 1725 cm-1; -COZEt, v =1721.5 cm-1; _C02But, v = 1718.5 cm-'. Attributing those IR absorptions to end-group carboxylates is subject to the caveat that they could also, inter alia, originate from minute amounts of ester-substituted cyclopropanes (resulting from the catalysed cyclopropanation of double bonds of the polymer backbone). However, further support for the formation of an initial metal-carbene ester comes from the observation that addition of the diazoester to the ruthenium complex before addition of the olefin led to poorly active (or inactive) catalyst systems, depending on the length of the incubation period (see Fig. 3). The R.'s were then, however, higher (Fig. 4), an observation that can be explained by a decrease in the number of active species in solution. Such ruthenium- carbene species are not expected to be stable and should rapidly decay to inactive species. Further applications, as well as mechanistic aspects of this new method, are currently under investigation. *A similar reaction has been proposed by B. A.

Eric Saive André J. Hubert Laboratory of Organic Synthesis and Catalysis, University of Liège, Sart Tilman (B.6), B-4000 Liège Belgium Addition of catalytic amounts of diazoesters to various ruthenium complexes, including some diruthenium(II,II) tetrakis carboxylates, led to new catalyst systems that promoted the ROMP not only of norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene) but also of cyclooctene and cyclopentene. The conversion and the cis content of the polymers varied widely and depended on the nature of the catalyst precursor. References 1 K.J. Ivin Olefin Metathesis 1983 Academic Press London 2 a V.
