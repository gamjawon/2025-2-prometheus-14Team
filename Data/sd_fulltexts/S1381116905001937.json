Box 110, Dalian 116023, PR China * Corresponding author. Tel.: +86 411 84379085; fax: +86 411 84694447. The structural features and catalytic properties of Pt–Sn/CeO2 catalysts prepared by modified polyol method were extensively investigated for the complete oxidation of ethanol. CO chemisorption, TPR, DTA and XPS measurements identically indicated that the electronic configuration of Pt by Sn as well as the formation of PtSn alloy were the key factors in determining the nature of the active sites. A strong Pt/Sn atomic ratio dependence of catalytic performances was observed, which was explained in terms of the changes in the surface structure of metal phases and the electronic Pt–Sn interaction. Graphical abstract The Pt–Sn/CeO2 catalysts were found to be highly active for the complete oxidation of ethanol. The addition of tin resulted in the changes in both surface structure of metallic phase and the electronic Pt–Sn interaction, thus promoting the catalytic performances. The electronic configuration of Pt by Sn as well as the formation of PtSn alloy was the key factors in determining the nature of the active sites. Keywords Pt–Sn/CeO2 Pt–Sn alloy Modified polyol method Complete oxidation of ethanol 1 Introduction Ethanol has been regarded as promising alternative fuel for vehicles due to its high energy density, less toxicity and availability in large quantities from biomass [1]. However, the undesirable partially oxidized products in complete oxidation of ethanol, such as acetaldehyde, CO and acetic ester, can lead to severe environment and health problems. As a result, the development of efficient catalysts, which can directly converting ethanol to CO2 and H2O at relatively low temperatures, has been receiving renewed attention [1,2]. Supported noble metal catalysts were found to be highly active for directly converting ethanol into CO2 with less acetaldehyde formation [1–6]. For instance, 100% conversion of ethanol was achieved over Ag/La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 catalyst at 493K [1], and that was obtained over Pt/Al2O3 even at 473K [2]. Even though, the rapid application of ethanol in energy aspects still calls for the development of more efficient catalysts to realize the total oxidation of ethanol at temperatures as low as possible. Recent studies have shown that the beneficial effects may be obtained by the addition of promoters to the supported noble metal catalysts [7–9]. For example, platinum–tin catalysts presented extremely high catalytic activities at lower temperatures in the preferential CO oxidation [7] and the oxidation of methanol [8]. Pt–Sn/C as anode catalyst also exhibited higher electro-catalytic performance than that of Pt/C catalyst due to the enhancement of the cleavage of CC bond by the addition of Sn [10]. The role of tin is often attributed to the formation of Pt–Sn alloy, which had better catalytic properties than Pt alone [9–12], and to the presence of well-dispersed Pt particles stabilized by tin [13]. Considering the recently reported Pt/CeO2 catalysts, which attracted much attention with quite promising catalytic activities in various reactions [15–17], it is expectable that Pt–Sn/CeO2 may be potential catalyst for the complete oxidation of ethanol at lower temperatures. In the present study, Pt/CeO2 and Pt–Sn/CeO2 catalysts with the Pt/Sn molar ratio ranging from 3:1 to 1:2 prepared by modified polyol method, were investigated for the complete oxidation of ethanol. The electronic effect of tin on platinum in Pt–Sn/CeO2 catalysts was also explored by means of TPR, XPS, CO chemisorption and DTA measurements. The temperature for complete oxidation of ethanol to CO2 was significantly reduced to 363K that is about 90–120K lower than those of previously reported [1,2]. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The CeO2 support was prepared by precipitation of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O aqueous solution with the addition of NH3·H2O solution until the pH value of the mixture was greater than 9.0 under vigorous stirring at 333K. The precipitant was then aged in the mother liquid for 4h, followed by filtration and washing with distilled water. The obtained solid was dried at 373K for 10h, and calcined at 723K for 4h in air. The metal precursors, chloroplatinic acid and tin(II) chloride, was dissolved into 60mL ethylene glycol (EG) and mixed with 3g CeO2 powder. The pH value of the mixture was then adjusted to 12 by the addition of 1M NaOH solution, and maintained at 403K for 1h to ensure the complete reduction of Pt. The resulting solid was filtered, washed with hot distilled water until no Cl− anion could be detected in filtrate by AgNO3 solution. After drying at 373K for 10h, the solid was calcined at 473K for 2h. The Pt loading for all samples was 3% by weight, and the Pt/Sn molar ratio varied from 3:1 to 1:2. For comparison, monometallic 3wt.% Pt/CeO2 and 5wt.% Sn/CeO2 catalysts were prepared in the same way. 2.2 Characterization The specific surface areas (S BET) of the catalysts were calculated from a multipoint Braunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis of the nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77K recorded on a micrometrics ASAP 2000 instrument. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Rigaku D/max-RB with Cu Kα radiation operated at 40kV and 100mA. The CO chemisorption measurements were carried out in CHEMBET 3000 adsorption instrument (QuantaChrome Co., USA). One hundred milligrams samples were reduced in H2 flow at 473K for 1h, and then purged with He at 473K for 30min to remove the adsorbed species. The CO chemisorption was conducted after cooling down the samples to room temperature. The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were conducted in a conventional setup equipped with a TCD detector. Samples of 100mg Pt/CeO2 or Pt–Sn/CeO2 were loaded and pretreated in He flow at 473K for 1h to remove the adsorbed carbonates and hydrates. After cooling down to ambient temperature and introducing the reduction agent of 5% H2/Ar, the temperature was then programmed to rise at 10K/min. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy measurement was performed with an ESCALAB MK-II spectrometer (VG Scientific Ltd., UK) using Al Kα radiation (1486.6eV) operated at an accelerating voltage of 12.5kV. The powder samples were pressed into thin discs and mounted on a sample rod placed in a pretreatment chamber, in which the catalysts were reduced at desired temperatures by flowing hydrogen for 2h. Then it was transferred into the analysis chamber where the spectra of Pt 4d, Sn 3d, Ce 3d and O 1s levels were recorded. Charging effects were corrected by adjusting the binding energy of C 1s peak to a position of 284.6eV. DTA experiments were performed on a Shimadzu DT-20B thermoanalysis instrument in the temperature range 300–1073K in N2. A temperature ramp of 10K/min was employed. 2.3 Activity measurements The catalytic activity tests were performed under atmospheric pressure in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor. Samples of 200mg (40–60mesh) were placed between two layers of quartz wool inside a quartz tube (i.d.=6mm). Prior to catalytic reactions, the catalysts were reduced with 10% H2/He at 473K for 2h. The oxidation of ethanol was performed between 298 and 473K. Liquid ethanol was injected by a micro-feeder and mixed with O2/He mixture (C2H5OH/O2/He=0.5/3/96.5vol.%) with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 40,000h−1. Effluents from the reactor were analyzed on-line by a HP6890 gas chromatography equipped with TCD and FID detectors. A Haysep D packing column was used to detect the CO, CO2, O2 and H2, and an Innowax capillary column was employed to separate oxygenates and hydrocarbons. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Surface area and structure The BET surface area of the CeO2 support was measured to be 103m2/g, and the deposition of platinum and tin caused a significant decrease in the specific surface area. The specific surface areas of Pt/CeO2, Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn molar ratio=1:1) and Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn molar ratio=1:2) catalysts were measured to be 92, 93 and 90m2/g, respectively. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of CeO2, Pt/CeO2 and Pt–Sn/CeO2 samples. As shown, the distinct fluorite oxide diffraction patterns of CeO2 were observed in all samples, and the average crystallite size of ceria was estimated to be about 9.3nm using the Scherrer equation. However, no diffraction peaks assigned to crystallines of platinum or tin species can be detected, even in samples after reduced at 773K, suggesting the high dispersion of platinum and tin species on the surface of CeO2. Table 1 lists the CO uptakes of the catalysts. The amount of CO adsorbed on Pt/CeO2 catalyst was measured to be 101μmol/gcat. The uptakes of CO adsorption on the bimetallic Pt–Sn/CeO2 catalysts were lower than that of Pt/CeO2 catalyst, ranging from 89 to 62μmol/gcat. This is consistent with the results of Verbeek and Sachtler [17], who observed the drastic decrease in the capacity of CO adsorption over Pt–Sn systems when the Sn/Pt atomic ratio increased from 0 to 2.0. However, it should be noted that the measured CO uptakes are relative values because CO can be adsorbed on the ceria surface, especially in the presence of metals [14]. In a comparative way, the results of CO adsorption still qualitatively indicated the change of accessibility of Pt to CO with the increase of tin content. 3.2 Temperature-programmed reduction In our previous study, the Pt/CeO2 was found to display a single reduction peak of PtO at 244K and reduction peak of surface CeO2 at 670K [16]. The TPR profiles of Sn/CeO2 and Pt–Sn/CeO2 catalysts are presented in Fig. 2 . Sn/CeO2 presented three reduction peaks at 576, 680 and 778K. The two overlapped reduction peaks at 576 and 680K can be ascribed to the reduction of SnO2 to SnO x (1< x <2) and removal of surface oxygen in CeO2, and the peak at 778K can be assigned to the surface reduction of SnO x to Sn [19]. For the Pt–Sn/CeO2 samples, their TPR profiles remarkably depended on the loading of tin, suggesting the presence of interaction between the two metals. The two separated reduction peaks appeared at 450K and 595K when the molar ratio of Pt/Sn was 3:1, respectively. The former can be assigned to the reduction of platinum oxide and the reduction of SnO2 to SnO x in intimate contact with platinum, and the later might be associated with the reduction of SnO x to Sn0. When the Pt/Sn ratio arrived at 1:1, the reduction peaks shifted to 390 and 490K corresponding to the reductions of platinum and tin oxides, respectively. Considering the disappearance of reduction peak at 576 and 680K, which appeared in Sn/CeO2, it is reasonable to say that the presence of platinum induced the reduction of SnO x by hydrogen spillover, and thus promoted the reduction of tin oxide. On the other hand, comparing with Pt/CeO2 sample, the reduction peak of Pt oxide in Pt–Sn/CeO2 shifted to higher temperature, indicating that the reduction of platinum was depressed by the addition of tin. With respect to the case of Pt/Sn=1:2, two overlapped reduction peaks were observed at 365 and 476K, but the intensity of low temperature reduction peak decreased accompanying by an increase in the intensity of the high temperature peak. Thus, it can be concluded the reduction of tin in Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts depends on the Pt/Sn molar ratio, and the reduction of platinum and tin species was preceded in a synergistic way. 3.3 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy Fig. 3 compares the X-ray photoelectron spectra of Pt 4f in Pt–Sn/CeO2 catalysts (Pt/Sn=1:1 and 1:2) experienced reduction with hydrogen. The binding energies and the relative concentrations of platinum and tin species are summarized in Table 2 . The XPS spectra of Pt 4f were resolved into three sets of spin-orbit doublets, which can be assigned to Pt0, Pt2+ and Pt4+, respectively. For the as-prepared Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:1), Pt species presented as Pt2+ (46%), Pt4+ (15%) and Pt0 (38%). After reduction with hydrogen at RT and 473K, the percentages of Pt0 greatly increased to 53% and 100%. The majority of the Pt species over the as-prepared Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:2) also was oxidized platinum species, and the percentages of Pt2+ and Pt4+ were 49% and 24%. Once reduced at RT, the proportion of reduced Pt species sharply increased to 81%, and the Pt species were completely reduced to Pt0 after reduction at 473K. Compared with the monometallic Pt/CeO2 catalyst in which 94% of Pt0 was presented even after reduction at RT, whereas only 50–80% of Pt0 was obtained in the Pt–Sn/CeO2 catalysts after reduction at RT, suggesting that tin suppress the reduction of Pt species. On the other hand, the binding energy of Pt 4f7/2 in Pt–Sn/CeO2 catalysts slightly shifted towards lower values (∼0.3eV), evidencing a possible charge transfer from Sn to Pt. XPS spectra of Sn 3d are shown in Fig. 4 , which were deconvoluted into two components: one at lower BE value (485.3–485.8eV) corresponds to Sn0 and the other at higher BE (468.6–487.0eV) represents oxidized tin species. As shown in Table 2, Pt–Sn/CeO2 catalysts showed that the percentage of Sn0 gradually increased with the reduction temperature. Reduction at 473K, the percentages of Sn0 in Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:1) and Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:2) increased to 49% and 56%, whereas the corresponding values further increased to 68% and 71% after reduction at 773K, respectively. This finding proved that about 70% of surface tin oxides were reduced simultaneously with platinum at temperatures below 773K. The increase in the metallic Sn concentration also evidenced the possibility of PtSn alloys formation. Together with the downshift of the binding energy of Pt 4f7/2, as shown in Fig. 4, the binding energy of Sn 3d5/2 in Pt–Sn/CeO2 catalysts shifted towards higher value, indicating possible electronic modification of tin through the Pt–Sn interaction. The relative surface compositions of Pt, Sn, Ce and O elements also changed after the samples were reduced with hydrogen, as shown in Table 3 . For the as-prepared Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:1), the Pt/Ce and Pt/Sn ratios were 0.43 and 0.99, respectively. Reduction at RT led to obvious increase of Pt/Ce and Pt/Sn ratios. When the reduction temperature increased from RT to 773K, the atomic ratios of Pt/Ce and Pt/Sn decreased, indicating the highly possible sintering of Pt particle, especially at higher reduction temperatures. Meanwhile, the coverage of ceria (or partially reduced ceria) on platinum surface and the simultaneously migration of tin to the surface which is often observed in CeO2-supported metal catalysts may be another reason [20]. With regard to the Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:2), the Pt/Sn molar ratio also increased initially, and then significantly decreased with the reduction temperature until it is close to the bulk Pt/Sn ratio. This behavior can be understood by considering Pt sintering and the migration of Sn from bulk to surface at reductive atmosphere. Consequently, exposed Pt surface atoms decreased with increasing tin loading and reduction temperature, suggesting some Pt particles were covered with Sn domains, especially in tin-rich sample. Recent studies concerning Pt–Sn bimetallic system has been focused on the oxidation state of tin and the possibility of alloy formation [21,22]. In our study, XPS measurements clearly indicated the presence of metallic tin in both the as-prepared and the reduced Pt–Sn/CeO2 catalysts, and the proportion of reduced tin increased with tin loading and reduction temperature. After reduction at 773K, the proportion of Sn0 in Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:1) and Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:2) increased to 68% and 71%, respectively, together with the fully reduced Pt. Thus, the alloying between tin and platinum is quite favorable under these conditions. Additionally, the DTA measurements of the Pt-Sn/CeO2 catalysts (Fig. 5 ) confirmed the occurrence of PtSn alloy with endothermal peaks emerged at 489K for Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:1) and 493K for Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:2). Similar conclusions were reached by Schubert, who confirmed that a significant fraction of the Sn in a supported PtSn catalyst involved in PtSn alloy formation after reduction in H2, while the remaining fraction was left as unreduced tin oxides [7]. XPS and Mössbauer spectroscopy also observed that from 30% to 70% of Sn0 presented in the form of PtSn alloy in Pt–Sn/Al2O3 and Pt–Sn/SiO2 [22,23]. These results suggested the presence of a strong and effective interaction between platinum and tin in the case of bimetallic PtSn catalysts. According to above discussion, the presence of metallic tin could be explained by the formation of Pt–Sn alloy. On the other hand, the downward shift of binding energy of platinum together with the upward shift of binding energy of tin evidenced the presence of a possible charge transfer from Sn to Pt. Moreover, the lower capacity of CO chemisorption in the bimetallic catalysts comparing to that of the monometallic one can also be related to modifications in the structure of the metallic phase that hinders the availability of surface Pt atoms to CO. Several controversial views concerning the exact nature of Pt–Sn interaction were proposed, probably due to different preparation techniques and treatment conditions [11–24]. The way that Sn modifies the catalytic behavior of Pt can vary from bulk alloying or surface decoration to electronic interaction. Humblot et al. observed that there exist many platinum crystals surrounded mostly by tin atoms supported on SiO2, forming so-called “sites isolation platinum crystals” [24]. The proportion of reduced tin species is close to 50%, higher than those usually reported for Pt–Sn and Rh–Sn catalysts prepared by conventional impregnation methods [25]. 3.4 Activity test The conversion of ethanol over Pt/CeO2 and Pt–Sn/CeO2 catalysts as a function of temperature is presented in Fig. 6 . Sn/CeO2 exhibited very low activity, no apparent ethanol conversion can be observed even at 400K, whereas the corresponding conversion of ethanol reached 100% over Pt/CeO2 even at 393K. For Pt–Sn/CeO2 catalysts, the conversion of ethanol increased initially with the addition of Sn, and approached a maximum at Pt/Sn atomic ratio of 1:1. The complete conversion temperature of ethanol over Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:1) decreased to at temperature as low as 363K. However, the conversion of ethanol decreased when the Pt/Sn atomic ratio was 1:2, even lower than that of monometallic Pt/CeO2 catalyst. For clarity, the calculated TOF was roughly compared. It is obvious that the TOF depended on the Pt/Sn ratio. For instance, the TOF value was 4.81×10−2 s−1 for the Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:1) and 4.19×10−2 s−1 for the Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=3:1) at 353K, while for Pt/CeO2 and Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:2), the corresponding values decreased to 2.01×10−2 and 2.42×10−2 s−1, respectively. The same activity of the Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:1) at 353K was attained only at 373K by the Pt/CeO2 and Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:2). Acetaldehyde was the main by-product in the process of ethanol oxidation, and the amounts of ethyl acetate and methane were relatively small. Acetaldehyde and ethyl acetate were observed at low conversion levels of ethanol, while trace amounts of methane only appeared at relatively high conversions of ethanol. Figs. 7 and 8 show the temperature dependences of acetaldehyde and CO2 selectivities over the catalysts investigated. The CO2 selectivity increased gradually with the reaction temperature, whereas acetaldehyde selectivity presented different tendency. For Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:1, 3:1) and Pt/CeO2 catalysts, acetaldehyde selectivity decreased with the temperature. Whereas, for Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:2), acetaldehyde selectivity initially increased and then dropped with reaction temperature after passing a maximum at 343K. The relatively low acetaldehyde selectivity below 343K was due to the formation of ethyl acetate, suggesting that addition of tin increases the selectivity of ethyl acetate at low conversion levels of ethanol. Over Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:1) and Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=3:1) catalysts, acetaldehyde selectivity reached to zero and CO2 became the unique reaction product at 363K. Comparatively, CO2 became the unique product above 393K over Pt/CeO2 and Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:2) catalysts. Even though, this temperature range (363–393K) is still much lower than the temperatures required for the complete oxidation of ethanol to CO2 over previous reported precious metal catalysts [1–3]. Additionally, it is needed to point out that methane appeared at different temperature domains for different samples. For Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:1, 3:1) samples, methane occurred at the temperature range of 333–353K, while it only was observed between 353 and 373K over the Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:2) and Pt/CeO2. Considering the formation of methane must involve the leakage of CC bond, so above discrepancy might be caused by the difference of the ability in activating CC bond. Thus, it can be concluded that the presence of appropriate Sn can facilitate the leakage of CC bond to form methane and CO, and then these products are further oxidized to final oxidation products. So, the ability in activating CC bond also is an important factor in improving the catalytic performances of ethanol oxidation. Clearly, the addition of tin can promotes the catalytic performances of Pt/CeO2 for ethanol oxidation. The Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:1) gave the highest catalytic performances with the complete oxidation of ethanol to CO2 and H2O at 363K, while higher temperatures were needed for the Pt–Sn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn=1:2) and Pt/CeO2 catalysts. Combining the reaction data of the complete oxidation of ethanol with the structural features of the Pt–Sn/CeO2 catalysts, it is reasonable to say that the enhanced catalytic activity is associated with the modification of electronic configuration of Pt and the formation of PtSn alloy stem from the effective interaction between Pt and Sn. The charge transfer from Sn to Pt would contribute greatly to polarize the CO and CC bonds, and therefore favor the reaction of activated ethoxy molecules with activated oxygen species. In addition, the interaction between Pt and Sn provides different sites in close proximity of each other, Pt particles facilitate the dissociative adsorption of ethanol and Sn sites intimately adjacent to the Pt particles would provide an alternative site for O2 activation. Consequently, this effective interaction could improve catalytic activities for ethanol oxidation. On the other hand, the separate SnO x phase would cover active Pt sites and impede ethanol chemisorption, so higher Sn loading would lead to the decrease of the catalytic performances. 4 Conclusions The Pt–Sn/CeO2 catalysts showed considerably high catalytic performances for the complete oxidation of ethanol to CO2 at 363K. The modification of electronic configuration of Pt and the formation of PtSn alloys determined the nature of the active sites contributing to the increase of catalytic performances for the complete oxidation of ethanol. The separate SnO2 phase at high tin loading would cover active Pt sites and impede ethanol chemisorption, resulting in a significant increase in the temperature required for complete oxidation of ethanol to CO2.
