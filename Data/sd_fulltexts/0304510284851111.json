CARTURAN, G. COCCO Universitd di Venezia, Facoltd di Chimica Industriale 2137, S.Marta, Venice (Italy) G. FACCHIN and G. NAVAZIO Istituto di Chimica Industriale e Centra C.N.R., Via F.Marzolo 9, Padua (Italy) (Received October 20, 1983; accepted January 12, 1984) Summary Phenylacetylene was hydrogenated using dispersed catalysts of Pd, Pt, and Pd Pt alloys with different Pd/Pt ratios, in tetrahydrofuran suspension at 25 C and constant H; pressure; the same reaction was also carried out using mechanical mixtures of single Pd and Pt catalysts. The catalysts are sufficiently selective for the steps corresponding to the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene and of styrene to ethylbenzene to appear separated. The Pd Pt system was studied as a function of the Pd/Pt ratio. Specific catalytic activity for the styrene hydrogenation displays a remarkable increase up to 20 - 30 at.% of Pt, whereas in the range 30 -100 at.% Pt, it corresponds to the sum of the individual Pt and Pd activities; in the case of the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene, the specific catalytic activity of alloy catalysts is smaller than the sum of individual Pd and Pt in the 10 -100 at.% Pt range. These results are discussed and interpreted in terms of the possible destabilizing effect of Pt alloying on the original Pd framework and of the chemical stability of the substrate + hydrogen + metallic surface ensemble. For the Pd Pt alloy catalysts, the data suggest that the selectivity is independent of the degree of dispersion. Introduction Alkynes display a larger thermodynamic adsorptive factor ys. metallic surfaces than the corresponding mono-olefins [1,2]; this fact allows selective hydrogenation of the alkynes, a typical example being the half- hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene using Pd catalysts [3]. Nevertheless, 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 376 particularly for Pd, another valuable selectivity factor consists in the avail- ability of hydrogen to the reacting catalytic ensemble. Scheme 1 shows the facets of the phenomenon in general terms: to the reacting ensemble made up of the coordinated alkyne, substrate S, and the surface-activated hydro- gen, Ha both occluded and dissolved hydrogens, Ho and Ha, may supply the excess of hydrogen required to complete hydrogenation. Ho and Ha contributions for Pd catalysts may be important enough to quench the selectivity originally determined by the larger stability of the alkyne-Pd metal interaction compared to that of the olefin-Pd metal [1,4-6]. According to Wells [7], the Ho contribution should be minimal for high metal dispersions and, in the case of Pd, the Ha presence is determined by the factors affecting Pd-hydride formation [8, 9]. Indeed, we have recently observed that selectivity in the half-hydrogenation of phenylacetylene may be improved by using highly dispersed Pd catalysts [10] with which j3-Pd H formation is unfavourable under mild hydrogenation conditions. Scheme 1. A certainly decisive method of restricting hydrogen dissolution is the use of Pd bimetallic systems, in particular Pd Pt alloys, for which even low Pt concentrations have been demonstrated to inhibit j3-Pd-hydride formation [11,12]. Thus, we have prepared Pd Pt catalysts already supported on amorphous dessicated gels, devoting one study to the unambiguous charac- terization of alloy occurrence and its behavior in the presence of H^ [13]. A further attraction in using dispersed Pd Pt alloy catalysts concerns the role of alloy composition in affecting catalytic activity. The great potential for industrial applications, and the valuable and sometimes unpredictable catalytic features of bimetallic systems, have naturally led a number of researchers to concentrate their interest on alloy catalysts [14 -17], apart from specific investigations on Pd Pt [11,12,18-22]. Experimental Standard techniques for air-sensitive compounds were used throughout the chemical experiments. Solvents were dried and distilled under nitrogen; distilled styrene and phenylacetylene were kept under nitrogen at 5 C, as were the Pd(C3Hs)2 and Pt(C:;H5)2 used as precursors for catalyst prepara- tion. A single support, of chemical composition SiO^Al^Oy/Via^O = 71/18/11, was used, obtained by hydrolysis of a Si(OEt)4, A^OBu^a and NaOMe 377 solution and dessiccated at 250 C [23]. This is an amorphous carrier with a total surface area of 423 m2 g~1. The general procedure for preparation of Pd, Pt and Pd Pt catalysts dispersed on the support has already been described in our previous papers [13, 24]. total surface area of 423 m2 g ! Hydrogenation kinetics Hydrogenation kinetics were carried out as in previously reported cases [10,23]. The apparatus used is shown in Fig. 1. Appropriate circulation jackets connected to an external thermostat allowed a temperature of 25.0 0.3 C to be maintained. A weighed amount of catalyst, usually about 50 mg, was placed into reaction vessel A and degassed at 10~3 mmHg for 3 h. 10 ml of dry degassed tetrahydrofuran were siphoned into A under H;, and A connected to glass burette B under H; fluxing. The system was left under stirring for 3 h to equalize the temperature and reach the Hz (gas) <=^ H; (solution) equilibrium at barometric pressure. The substrate was injected using a precision syringe through the arm fitted with a silicon septum, and the kinetic run was started. Fig. 1. The hydrogenation apparatus. The progress of the reaction was followed on the basis of the volumet- ric Ha consumption recorded maintaining constant H; pressure. At the same time, a suitable number of 10 Jul samples were withdrawn from the reaction mixture and immediately analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography on a HP 5730 A chromatograph. After correction for instrumental artifacts, the data resulted in the diagram shown in Fig. 2, where the corresponding plot based on H; absorption is also shown. The linearity of these % concentration us. time diagrams was maintained up to 90% conversion; accordingly, since H2 pressure is kept constant during the kinetic run, the kinetic results are 378 Fig. 2.

Data allow calculation of rate constants corresponding to both the phenylacetylene and styrene hydrogenations. The reproducibility of the experiments was tested. Thus, with the cata- lytic system already used for one experiment, some kinetic runs were repeated three or four times in order to test catalyst stability and the absence of traces of poisoning agents in the substrate. The resulting deviations fell within the 5% standard deviation found in the first run. The efficient external magnetic stirring of the reacting slurry avoided diffusion-controlled 379 hydrogenation, as confirmed by the increase in the pseudo-zero-order rate constants in proportion to the amount of catalyst. Results The catalysts used and their main features are listed in Table 1. All catalysts were composed of a metallic dispersion of Pd, Pt or Pd Pt alloys on the same amorphous Xerogel; some catalysts were pure Pd or pure Pt or a mechanical mixture of both; others were Pd Pt alloys with different Pd/Pt atomic ratios. Details of the characterizations of the catalysts listed in Table 1 have previously been reported [13]. Phenylacetylene and styrene hydrogenations were carried out at constant H^ pressure at 25 0.3 C. The resulting % conversion us. time plots display a linear trend, indicating that the hydrogenation rate is independent of substrate concentration. Kinetic results were expressed in M s~1 m-n^etai i\" order to compare the activity of the different systems in terms of specific catalytic activity.

Discussion The specific catalytic activity as a function of at.% Pt is shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Different behavior is observed in the case of styrene (Fig. 3) with respect to phenylacetylene hydrogenation (Fig. 4); in the latter case, catalytic activity has a maximum at ~10% Pt and falls to a pseudo-minimum at ~50% Pt; styrene hydrogenation shows a maximum at ~20% of Pt, whereas in the range 40 -100% Pt, the catalytic activity is identical to that of Pd + Pt mechanical mixtures. The use of different catalysts composed of a mechanical mixture of pure Pd + pure Pt catalysts is a useful tool to reveal the peculiar catalytic behavior of Pd Pt alloy catalysts: in fact, the specific catalytic activity of our mechanical mixtures corresponds to the sum of the individual contributions of pure Pd and pure Pt catalysts. It is noteworthy that our Pd, Pt and Pd Pt catalysts display similar dimensions of metallic particles, so that the results of Figs. 3 and 4 should not be affected by the possible dependence of the specific catalytic activity on the degree of dispersion. Moreover, in agreement with the theory of Williams and Nason [24] and the results of Karpinski and Koscielski [18], the surface enrichment of the more volative component (Pd) is considerably depressed in our case because of the small metal particles of the alloy dispersions examined. As documented in several papers [25-28], the kinetic behavior of unsaturated hydrocarbon hydrogenation with Pd and Pt catalysts is 381 0 20 40 60 80 100 %Pt Fig. 3.

Our results agree with this general pattern which, according to the Horiuti-Polanyi reaction mechanism [29], should imply that H; activation and/or R H elimination are rate-deter- mining steps. This fact allows discussion of our catalytic activity and selectivity data concerning Pd Pt alloys, pure Pd and pure Pt catalysts in terms of a unique approach. The fee crystalline framework of Pd is known to be flexible enough to allow hydrogen dissolution with expansion of the original lattice parameter [30, 31]. In addition, the phenomenon is definitely accompanied by impor- tant modifications of the electronic ground state of Pd, since hydrogen electrons progressively occupy electronic energy levels of the Pd 4d band [32]. In descriptive terms, the energy situation of the fundamental pure Pd lattice and the Pd electronic configuration can be promoted to high-energy sub-levels corresponding to different populations of interstitial hydrogens 382 (dissolved hydrogen). Pd alloying with Pt may be similarly treated: at low at.% Pt, the original Pd structure and electronic configuration is maintained, with some valuable changes to accommodate Pt perturbing effects. This hypothesis is confirmed, albeit indirectly, by our previous study on Ha disso- lution in Pd Pt alloys with low Pt content [13]: hydrogen dissolution is typical of bulk palladium metal and also occurs in Pd Pt alloys, and is pro- gressively reduced as Pt loading increases up to 20 - 30 at.% Pt. However, above 20 - 30 at.% Pt, the pure Pd system evolves to more appropriate structural and electronic situations which are not amenable to H; disso- lution. With this in mind, the behavior shown in Fig. 3 may be accounted for: Pt alloying progressively destabilizes Pd metal to high-energy sub-levels: at this point the system may display a surface reactivity greater than pure Pd, justifying the enhancement of catalytic activity. Above 30 at.% Pt, the structure collapses to more stable energy situations, behaving as the sum of individual Pd + Pt contributions to catalytic activity. In the interval 30 - 100 at.% Pt, multiple Pt units such as Pt;, Pt3, ... may be present on the surface [33], in agreement with computer simulation studies on other bimetallic catalysts [34]. Since both H; activation and R H elimination require two adjacent metal atoms and are rate-determining, the equivalence of alloy catalytic activity with that of mechanical mixtures is not surprising. Inciden- tally, some recent results indicate that, for Pd Pt alloys, the two metals maintain their individual chemisorption features vs. Hz [22]. On the other hand, below 30 at.% Pt, we associated the enhancement of specific catalytic activity to enhanced reactivity of Pd, tacitly excluding any valuable Pt contribution. In other words, in analogy with other hydrogenation processes [35], we suggest that Pt alloying may enhance Pd catalytic activity in alloys having a modest at.% Pt suitable for quenching Hz dissolution and promoting the Pd fundamental state to higher energy content. The phenylacetylene case shown in Fig. 4 is apparently more complex: indeed, as emphasized in a previous paper concerning the hydrogenation of this same substrate with Pd catalysts [10], the bonding of the acetylenic moiety to metallic surfaces is stronger than the usual mono-olefin w-bonding. In fact, the C=C ys. metal surface interaction may involve two a bonds with adjacent atoms of the metal surface [3]. This fact implies that the catalytic ensemble may be composed ofatleast2(H2 activation) + 2(acetylene moiety) metal atoms. Since it is generally accepted and well established that a Pt C and Pt H bonds are more stable than the corresponding Pd bonds, the 4-atom units of the type PtPd3, Pt^Pdz and Pt3Pd, once they have reacted with Hz and the acetylenic substrate, should give reaction intermediates which are more stable than the corresponding species involving Pd4 units. On these grounds, the behavior of the phenylacetylene hydrogenation of Fig. 4 may be accounted for: at very low at.% Pt, Pd catalytic activity is enhanced similarly to styrene hydrogenation because of the Pt destabilizing effect on Pd. However, as the alloy's chemical composition allows the formation of 383 mixed 4-atom Pd Pt units on the surface, catalytic activity falls below the level expected for the corresponding mechanical mixtures. In benzene hydrogenation with Pd Pt alloy catalysts [22], it was also observed that the alloy activity is lower than that of the mechanical mix- tures. This fact confirms that, as the hydrogenation process requires a large surface ensemble, the reaction intermediates become more stable for Pd Pt alloy catalysts than for pure Pd. The selectivity data in Table 2 indicate that pure Pd catalysts are more suitable for selective hydrogenation than Pt or Pd Pt alloys. More precisely, Pt catalysts are less selective than Pd, so that on increasing the Pt content in Pd Pt alloys, selectivity decreases. The particularly high stability of vinyl intermediates on Pt catalysts could be related to this fact [4]. These results agree with those of Caga and Winterbottom on 1-octyne hydrogenation with Pd Pt catalysts less dispersed than our alloys [12]. This seems to suggest that the selectivity of Pd Pt catalysts is not affected by the degree of dispersion, in contrast with pure Pd, where selectivity is directly affected by Pd dispersion. Indeed, P-Pd H occurrence is kinetically con- trolled by the Pd dispersion and affects the selectivity of alkyne hydro- genation [8,10]; since Pt alloying reduces hydrogen dissolution into Pd [11 - 13], it seems reasonable that for Pd Pt alloys, selectivity becomes independent of metal dispersion.

        "dc:description": "Phenylacetylene was hydrogenated using dispersed catalysts of Pd, Pt, and Pd-Pt alloys with different Pd/Pt ratios, in tetrahydrofuran suspension at 25°C and constant H2 pressure; the same reaction was also carried out using mechanical mixtures of single Pd and Pt catalysts. The catalysts are sufficiently selective for the steps corresponding to the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene and of styrene to ethylbenzene to appear separated. The Pd-Pt system was studied as a function of the Pd/Pt ratio. Specific catalytic activity for the styrene hydrogenation displays a remarkable increase up to 20–30 at.% of Pt, whereas in the range 30–100 at.% Pt, it corresponds to the sum of the individual Pt and Pd activities; in the case of the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene, the specific catalytic activity of alloy catalysts is smaller than the sum of individual Pd and Pt in the 10–100 at.% Pt range. These results are discussed and interpreted in terms of the possible destabilizing effect of Pt alloying on the original Pd framework and of the chemical stability of the substrate + hydrogen + metallic surface ensemble. For the Pd-Pt alloy catalysts, the data suggest that the selectivity is independent of the degree of dispersion.",
