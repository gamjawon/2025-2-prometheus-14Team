ROONEY Department of Chemistry, The Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast BT9 SAG (U.K.) (Received August 9, 1988; accepted December 1, 1988) Introduction Selective air oxidation of small paraffins, and especially the conversion of methane to formaldehyde, remains one of the major challenges in hetero- geneous catalysis: CH4 + 0; > CH^O + HzO We discuss here an attempt to solve this problem by systematically and carefully synthesizing catalysts using guidelines based on a wealth of infor- mation and ideas collated from the field of selective oxidation of hydro- carbons, catalysed by both enzymatic and non-enzymatic transition metal complexes, and from the corresponding field of olefin methathesis, the common denominator between these two being the interchangeability of oxene and carbene ligands. Such considerations narrowed the choice to one basic recipe, namely, the excellent olefin metathesis catalysts, MoCl5/R4Sn, grafted onto activated silica granules using methylene chloride as a non- aqueous solvent. When the dried solid is brought to a stable state at 700 C, it exhibits high sustained selectivities for formation of formaldehyde at substantial conversions of methane. Many variations of this basic catalyst, which worked the first time, were tried and the more successful are described. In all systems PCl3 was found to be a beneficial ingredient, especially when added before R4Sn. The reasons why certain procedures were adopted are discussed and the conclusion reached that a critical Sn^^ silicotphosph^molybdate complex which probably contains a tetrahedral dioxo Mo^ ion is the active site. The presence of both oxy (hydroxy) and chloride ions as ligands in the correct proportions seems to be essential in the low-temperature stages of catalyst preparation. The following facts and ideas have suggested to us that certain olefin metathesis catalysts might with advantage be explored for selective air oxidation of paraffins, and in particular the conversion of methane to formaldehyde. 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands L18 The porphyrinato iron(V) oxene, XN4Fev=0, found in the biologically active cytochrome P-450 complexes, catalyses hydroxylation of an unacti- vated C H bond in alkanes apparently by a free radical mechanism, in accordance with reaction (1) [1]: Fe^O + RH > [Fe^OH)^ ] > Fe111 + ROH (1) This system has been mimicked frequently by many non-enzymatic catalysts, including the famous 'Gif system based on a trinuclear iron acetate cluster as developed by Barton and coworkers [2]. The remarkable similarity of many such monooxygenase-catalysed reactions to carbene and nitrene reactions led Hamilton [3] to propose the oxenoid mechanism. He also predicted that there should be a group of electrophilic oxenoid reagents, e.g. V^O, Cr^O, Mo^^O, Ru^O, etc. capable of transferring an oxygen atom to alkanes, alkenes, aromatics and other organic substrates. For example, a [2+2] cycloaddition mechanism can be envisaged (reaction (2)) for epoxidation of olefins catalysed by cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase and other traditional oxometal oxidants, such as C^^O reagents [4]. Fe^O __ Fev-0 __ ^ 0 >c=c( >c-c( >c -c( Olefin metathesis is a reaction which also proceeds via a [2+2] cyclo- addition reaction involving metallacarbene complexes, analogous to oxo- metal complexes (reaction (3)) [5]. M==C( M-C< M Y -_ ^ , __ ^ + ^ /c-c^ /c c^ c^ ^ Furthermore, formation and metathetic cleavage of oxametallacyclobutanes are frequently involved in initiation of olefin metathesis chain reactions and are important features connecting the 'carbene' and 'oxene' areas of catalysis [5]. The Wittig reaction which the Tebbe reagent, (T^-Cs^^aTi^Ha, undergoes with ketones is now a classical example of this type of behaviour, which is currently used in ring-opening metathesis polymerizations to terminate the chain reaction and cap the ends of the polymer chains (reac- tion (4)) [6]: \\/ \\/ \\ / \\ / C C C-C^ >C=C< / \\/ \\ A II + Jl > | J > ' + ' (4) M 6 M-6 M=0 The reverse pathway in reaction (4) explains why oxygen and oxygen atom- carrying reagents, e.g. epoxides, are often beneficial or essential additives in olefin metathesis systems. Thus we have noted [7] that molecular oxygen activates a variety of Ru complexes as catalysts for ring-opening polymeriza- tion of norbomene. At the same time formation of norbornene epoxide, norbomanone, and of the corresponding polyethers from the epoxide takes L19 place. This is a very important result, because it clearly indicates reversible formation of Ru-oxene and Ru-carbene complexes, with all of the reac- tions, (2), (3) and (4), occurring simultaneously in the same system. In recent years a great deal of attention has been given to the catalysed oxidation of methane (ca. 700 C) on a variety of metal oxides. Selective oxidative dimerization to ethane and ethylene using molecular oxygen is the main industrial interest, there being good evidence for a free radical mechanism [8]. The alternative pathway, namely, the formation of formal- dehyde, although highly desirable, is never significant, except when N30 is used as the oxidant in conjunction with molybdenum oxide catalysts, Mo^^O complexes are inferred [9], with intermediate formation and decomposition via free radicals of a methoxy complex (reaction (5)). Mo=0 + CH4 ^ Mo-OH + CHa CHs + Mo=0 > Mo-OCHg (5) The mechanisms postulated are very similar, therefore, to those advocated for biological activation of paraffins by cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase. All of this prompted us to explore certain olefin metathesis catalysts as potentially selective catalysts for high temperature air oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. Mo was chosen because Mo^^O complexes are now well documented for many enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxidations, in contrast to ^1^=0 complexes. These two metals, Mo and W, also provide the vast majority of highly active olefin metathesis systems, the only other metal of comparable reactivity being Re. Furthermore, we decided to use R4Sn (R = Me, Bu, and Ph) as activators because these tin reagents are not only excellent cocatalysts for transition metal halides, but tin is also either an essential or a very beneficial ingredient for both homogeneous and heteroge- neous metathesis of alkenes having functional groups [10]. Heterogeneous Mo/Sn oxide systems have also exhibited good selectivities for oxidation of propylene to acetone [II], in contrast to the usual ally lie oxidation found with many oxide combinations, e.g. the highly selective Bi Mo P oxide sys- tem. This unusual behaviour of the Mo/Sn system in introducing a carbonyl functionality, thereby affording an otherwise saturated compound, acetone, was a further clue that such systems might also convert methane selectively to formaldehyde. .Results and discussion When silica-supported MoCl5/R4Sn catalysts are prepared in the fol- lowing careful fashion, very selective air oxidation of methane can be achieved. Thus we have noted up to 80% selectivity at 20% conversion at 700 C using a methane/air input of 1/1 at a total pressure of 1 atm in a flow system (25 ml min~1). Accurate analyses were difficult, since for the most active catalysts formaldehyde condensed out as crystals of paraldehyde from the effluent. Small amounts of ethane and ethylene were also noted with comparable yields of acetaldehyde, while CO and CO; accounted for the remainder of the methane converted. L20 A typical catalyst was prepared as follows:Mods (Aldrich) (0.057 g, 0.2 mmol) was added to methylene chloride (50 ml) freshly distilled over CaHa under dry nitrogen. Then silica (Crossfields, 100-120 mesh) (2 g), which had been previously activated at 600 C in a muffle furnace and cooled in a dessicator, was added under N3 with shaking to the deep red solution. The activation of the silica via dehydroxylation at high tempera- tures (550 - 700 C) had previously been observed to be highly beneficial in dispersing transition metal halide anionic complexes in the course of prepa- ration of several catalysts [12]. Presumably, strained ^Si O Si^- linkages are formed via dehydration, and these sites are capable of rapid attack on M C1 bonds even under aqueous conditions. The SiO^ granules rapidly adsorbed MoClg and became uniformly blue. Tetrabutyl tin (0.2 ml, 1.2 mmol) was then added, causing the colour to change to dark green. A sample of the catalyst at this stage was very active for metathesis polymerization of norbomene. The solvent was rotary evaporated and the particles dried further in an oven at 120 C for several hours and then loaded (1.2 g) into a quartz reactor. The temperature was gradually raised to 700 C, using a N3 stream which was then switched to the CH^air mixture. Products were analysed by GLC and GLC/MS using a Poropak column operating at 130 C. The dry catalyst retained its grey-green colour even after prolonged use. Sn/Mo ratios down to 1/1 were used without significant deterioration in catalyst performance, and loadings up to 5% Mods on SiO^ were not detri- mental to selectivity, although low-loadings were found preferable. Many variations of this basic recipe were screened, and the following are the most noteworthy conclusions. When Me4Sn and Pl^Sn were used in place of Bu4Sn, the catalysts were much less selective. We have no explana- tion for this effect, except to note that Me4Sn and Ph4Sn invariably exhibit very similar behaviour as cocatalysts for ring-opening polymerization while Bu4Sn behaves differently [13]. When much more pure MoCl5 (Aldrich Gold Label) was used, the silica turned a deep red and on treatment with Bu4Sn became a very dark brown. This catalyst had very low selectivity for formaldehyde formation. These results indicate that it is partially hydrolysed MoCl5, i.e. containing oxy and/or hydroxy groups, which when grafted onto activated SiO; provides the active sites upon treatment with Bu4Sn. There is a further intriguing parallel here with metathesis activity: it has often been noted that traces of mois- ture, alcohols, epoxides etc., i.e. oxygen-containing compounds, are highly beneficial in activating Mods, Reds and WClg in conjunction with main group metal alkyls as olefin metathesis catalysts [10]. The possible role of spectator oxy ligands has been discussed [14). The grafting procedure used here may also produce tetrahedral dioxo and hydroxy complexes, e.g. (0=)2Mo(0~)2 [15], and these may be essential for high selectivity in formaldehyde formation. As expected, WCle in place of Mods gave some formaldehyde but the main products were ethane/ethylene and aromatics (benzene, toluene, xylenes, trimethylbenzenes and naphthalene). These catalysts rapidly coked, unlike the Mo systems. L21 We have also noted that PCl3 is in general a very beneficial additive especially when added before treatment with Bi^Sn. This was also found to be the case even when molybdena-silica was first prepared under aqueous conditions, activated at 550 C, and then treated with PC4 in CH^Cl^ fol- lowed by Bu4Sn. Molybdena-silica (0.5 wt.% Mo) was prepared by impreg- nating activated silica using an aqueous acidic solution (HC1 or HN03 at pH = 1) of ammonium paramolybdate. Without PClg treatment, formal- dehyde formation using these catalysts, even when treated with Bu4Sn, could not be detected. A silicomolybdate phase is formed under these conditions [16], which were thus used in order to induce formation of tetrahedral sites. The introduction of phosphorus would also encourage formation of silico- phosphomolybdate centres and thus tetrahedrally coordinated Mo ions. However, an important effect of PCl3 addition may also be the introduction of OF\" ions into the system at a critical preparative stage. We have also impregnated silica with magnesium nitrate and boric acid in the ratio MgO/B^Og/SiOa as 1/1/10, and found that when this support was treated with Mods, PC^ and Bu4Sn in that order (Mo/Sn/P as 1/1/1) using 1 wt.% MoCl5 on the support, an excellent catalyst was obtained. Mg and B oxides were deliberately added to encourage formation and selective con- version of intermediate methyl radicals [8]. The activated silica used was sufficiently acidic to convert triphenyl- methanol in dry benzene at room temperature into the triphenylmethyl carbonium ion. This may be very significant because it shows clearly that other metal ions are present as trace impurities, perhaps making an impor- tant contribution to the development of the active sites. Other things being equal, large particles of silica (16-30 mesh) were also superior in making active catalysts. We have also noted the same feature when examining activities of a series of Li-ftfMgOfSiO-^ catalysts of different particle sizes for oxidative dimerization of methane to ethylene and ethane. This parallel behaviour is also indicative of free radical processes and the importance of the relative rates of diffusion of methane and oxygen within the pores of a high surface area catalyst. Our main conclusions are that the presence of both 0, OH, OR, OSi^- ligands, etc., and CT ligands seems to be essential at a critical intermediate stage to produce the correct type of Mo complex which then evolves on further treatment into a selective centre for paraffin oxidation. It is ex- tremely unlikely that Cl~ ions are retained in the catalyst at 700 C because of hydrolysis. So far we have found that Sn alkyls, and especially Bu4Sn cocatalysts, are required since good selectivity cannot be achieved in the absence of tin, or even when SnCI; was used instead. Phosphorus in the form of PCl3 added at an early stage, either simultaneously with or immediately after Mod;, is in general beneficial. More conventional molybdena-silica catalysts, when treated in a similar fashion with PClg and Bu4Sn, are also selective. The results are also somewhat variable even when repeating the same procedures. This is attributed to the effects of traces of moisture and the degree of ageing of samples of Mods (hydrolysis). However, the results L22 are most encouraging because they demonstrate for the first time that the critical sites required for selective paraffin oxidation can be constructed. References 1 R. A.

Note added in proof The best catalyses have a characteristic ESR spectrum where there is a pronounced sharp symmetric singlet, virtually with the spin-free g value, in addition to the usual signal for Mo5* ions. The sharp singlet is attributed to F-centres which may well be the main source of methane activation.
