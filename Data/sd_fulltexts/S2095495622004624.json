Graphical abstract Porous 2D N-doped carbon electrocatalyst consisting of atomically disperse Ni active centers with Ni-N4-O coordinated structure which act as efficient polysulfides traps and highly LiPSs conversion catalysts. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with high theoretical energy density are promising advanced energy storage devices. However, shuttling of dissolute lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) and sluggish conversion kinetics impede their applications. Herein, single nickel (Ni) atoms on two-dimensional (2D) nitrogen(N)-doped carbon with Ni-N4-O overcoordinated structure (SANi-N4-O/NC) are prepared and firstly used as a sulfur host of Li-S batteries. Due to the efficient polysulfides traps and highly LiPSs conversion effect of SANi-N4-O/NC, the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries obviously improved. The batteries can well operate even under high sulfur loading (5.8 mg cm−2) and lean electrolyte (6.1 μL mg−1) condition. Meanwhile, density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that Ni single atom’s active sites decrease the energy barriers of conversion reactions from Li2S8 to Li2S due to the strong interaction between SANi-N4-O/NC and LiPSs. Thus, the kinetic conversion of LiPSs was accelerated and the shuttle effect is suppressed on SANi-N4-O/NC host. This study provides a new design strategy for a 2D structure with single-atom overcoordinated active sites to facilitate the fast kinetic conversion of LiPSs for Li-S cathode. Keywords Nickel single atom catalyst Ni-N4-O sites 2D N-doped carbon Li-S batteries Shuttle effect 1 Introduction Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is a promising candidate for energy storage because of the high energy density (2600 Wh Kg−1), and high capacity (1675 mA h g−1) [1–3]. Nevertheless, the commercialization of Li-S batteries is mainly plagued by the polysulfide shuttle effects and sluggish reaction kinetics of LiPSs conversion in lithiation/delithiation process [4]. The shuttle effects, resulting from the transfer of dissolved LiPSs in electrolyte between cathode and anode, lead to the corrosion of lithium anode, which causes irreversible capacity fading [5–7]. Moreover, the conversion of soluble high-order LiPSs to insoluble Li2S2/Li2S has sluggish reaction kinetics. It not only exasperates the rate performance, but also leads to the continuous accumulation of LiPSs in the electrolyte, which further aggravates the shuttle effect [8]. Besides, the low electronic/ionic conductivity of sulfur/Li2S2/Li2S species increases the internal resistance and reduces the sulfur utilization [9]. Therefore, it is urgently desirable to develop novel strategy and efficient materials to anchor the LiPSs and accelerate their conversion kinetics in Li-S batteries. The electrocatalytic strategy, which can expedite immobilization and conversion of the soluble LiPSs, is regarded as an effective way to suppress the shuttling and accumulation of LiPSs [10]. Moreover, it is also indispensable for the electrode to design anchor traps, which can further improve the sulfur utilization. Single atoms catalysts (SACs) are promising candidates, due to the distinctive electronic structure of single atoms (SAs) with separated energy levels and sufficient exposed metal centers [10,11], which can serve as the strong anchor traps to catalyze redox reactions in energy conversion [12]. Besides, the formation of metal-nitrogen (M-N) structure effectively inhibits SAs with high surface free energy agglomerate into metal particles, which prevent SAs from catalytic activity decay [13]. Therefore, M-N structure embedded on nitrogen doped carbon (NC) can ensure the chemical stability of SAs and further keep the enhanced conversion kinetics in electrochemical reaction [14]. Based on affluent active Ni single atoms and great conductivity, the NC with Ni-N4 structure can both strongly anchor the LiPSs and accelerate the LiPSs conversion reaction kinetics in Li-S battery [15]. Besides, the coordination number of N can regulate the catalytic performance and adsorption capacity for LiPSs of nickel single atom catalysts [1]. However, the Ni single atom with Ni-N4 sites coordinated with axial atom and the corresponding catalysis mechanism for LiPSs redox conversion have rarely been reported. Herein, the Ni single atoms with Ni-N4-O overcoordinated structure embedded on 2D N doped carbon (SANi-N4-O/NC) were prepared and used as sulfur host in Li-S batteries. Since single Ni atom offers the active Ni centers and good conductivity, it can tightly trap the LiPSs, effectively speeding up the redox reaction. The interaction mechanism between LiPSs and SANi-N4-O/NC (or NC) surface was analyzed through testing results of XPS, LiPSs adsorption and in-situ XRD. Moreover, compared to NC, the Li-S batteries with SANi-N4-O/NC active host material represent much improved rate performance and long cycling stability in normal coin cells. Finally, the DFT calculations demonstrate that reduction reaction from S8 to Li2S is more thermodynamics favorite on SANi-N4-O/NC surface than in the case of NC. The work offers a unique strategy for designing single atom active sites, and promotes a deep understanding of LiPSs reversible conversion. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials 2.1.1 Synthesis of SANi-N4-O/NC and NC Firstly, anhydrous manganese acetate (1.08 g, 6.24 mmol) and nickel acetate (0.39 g, 1.57 mmol) was dissolved in 60 mL of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF). After complete dissolution, sodium benzoate (0.674 g, 4.68 mmol) was added to the above solution under vigorous stirring for 12 h at room temperature. Terephthalic acid (1.83 g, 11.02 mmol) was further added for another 1 h vigorous stirring. Then this system was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave at 180 °C for 10 h. After cooling down to the room temperature, the product was separated by centrifugation and washed three times by DMF and ethanol, respectively, then dried overnight under vacuum at 60 °C. The obtained gray powder was further annealed at 700 °C for 2 h in ammonia atmosphere with a ramping rate of 2.5 °C min−1 forming a black powder. After sulfuric acid leaching, the SANi-N4-O/NC was obtained. The NC was synthesized by the same method involving no anhydrous nickel acetate. 2.1.2 Synthesis of SANi-N4-O/NC@S and NC@S The obtained SANi-N4-O/NC or NC was homogeneously mixed with sulfur powder in a mortar (the weight ratio of obtained materials to sulfur was 1: 10), the mixed powder was sealed in a quartz tube and heated at 155 °C for 12 h, then the obtained product was heated at 200 °C for 15 min at air atmosphere to remove extra sulfur outside the materials. 2.2 Materials characterizations The distributions of as prepared samples’ morphologies were characterized by field emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL-2100F) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (Tecnai G2 F20S-TWIN). The fine morphology was obtained by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) (Titan Cubed Themis G2 300). Raman spectra were performed by Laser confocal Raman spectrometer. The crystallization was estimated using a ZETIUM DY powder XRD with Cu Kα X-rays at 4 KW. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was tested using an Escalab 250 Xi system equipped with a microfocusing monochromatic Al K α source and high region resolution up to 0.45 eV. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) area was collected on Micromeritics 3flex at 77 K. The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) data were collected at BL14W1 beamline in Shanghai and Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). The storage ring of SSRF was operated at 3.5 GeV with a maximum current of 240 mA. Using a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator, the Ni K-edge data collections were carried out in fluorescence mode with a Lytle detector full of argon gas. 2.3 Electrochemical measurement To prepare the cathode, 80 wt% SANi-N4-O/NC@S (or NC@S), 10 wt% carbon black, 10 wt% PVDF were mixed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to obtain a homogenous slurry. The above slurry was cast onto carbon coated Al foil by doctor blade method and then dried in oven at 60 °C for 12 h. Electrochemical experiments were carried out using stainless steel coin cells (CR2025) with Li foil as anode, SANi-N4-O/NC@S or NC@S composite electrode as cathode. A Celgard 2500 polypropylene membrane was cut into discs with a diameter of 19 mm and used as separator. The electrolyte was 1.0 M lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonylimide (LiTFSI) dissolved in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) (1: 1 ratio by volume) with 1.0% lithium nitrate as the additive. The electrolyte volume/sulfur mass ratio was maintained at 15 μL mg−1. For higher sulfur loading, the various loading amount was 5.8 mg cm−2. With the cathode area of ∼1.13 cm2 (diameter 12 mm). The mass of sulfur was calculated as ∼6.51 mg, the corresponding E/S ratio was 6.1 µL mg−1. The Galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were conducted in a potential range of 1.7–2.8 V at different current densities using NEWARE battery testing system. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) (1.7–2.8 V) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (0.1–106 Hz, 5 mV) measurements were conducted on CHI660 electrochemical workstation. The above electrochemical tests were carried out at room temperature. 2.4 DFT calculations DFT analyses were computed using CASTEP code in the Materials Studio. Calculations were performed with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation under the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). A semi-empirical addition of dispersive forces to conventional DFT was included in the calculation to account for van der Waals interactions. 3 Results and discussion The SANi-N4-O/NC and NC were synthesized according to our previous research [16]. The synthesis process of SANi-N4-O/NC@S is schematically illustrated in Fig. S1. The Ni, Mn-MOFs (Fig. S2) was prepared as a precursor and then treated at 700 °C under NH3 atmosphere and acid leaching, SANi-N4-O/NC was obtained while the Mn species that aggregate to form MnO nanocrystals were completely removed [17]. The synthesized SANi-N4-O/NC possesses a continuously lamellar structure with uniformly C, N, O and Ni elements distribution (Fig. S3). No distinct Ni diffraction peaks can be found in XRD result (Fig. S4). Besides, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, Fig. 1 a) only shows lattice distance of carbon; the atomic-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM, Fig. 1b) figure demonstrates the randomly dispersed isolated nickel atoms. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES, Fig. 1c) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS, Fig. 1d) further verify that the atomic coordination form of Ni atom is a unique configuration for the Ni-N/O bonding. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the absorption pre-edge position of SANi-N4-O/NC is located near NiO and NiPc, indicating that the Ni of SANi-N4-O/NC has a partial oxidation state. The typical peak of the dipole-allowed transition (1s-3d) [18] around 8340 eV is very weak in the curve of SANi-N4-O/NC, which means the as designed structure is not a typical square-planar M−N4 model, in other words, it’s disrupted or distorted by other atoms which result in missing the important identification marks. Fourier transforms for EXAFS was performed to further verify the chemical environment of atomic Ni dispersion (Fig. 1d). SANi-N4-O/NC and NiPc only shows apparent peak strength which is consistent with SANi-N4-O/NC at 1.46 Å, while Ni foil showed a dominating peak at 2.17 Å which refer to the Ni-Ni scattering path. The absence of Ni-Ni scattering path in SANi-N4-O/NC indicates that Ni exists at the atomic level and not the crystalline metal structure. EXAFS curve fitting analysis was performed to clarify the chemical configuration and structure parameters of atom Ni dispersion (Fig. 1e and Table. S1). The best fitting results of SANi-N4-O/NC reveal that the main peak at 1.26 Å and 1.69 Å were superimposed by four Ni-N/C with 1.96 Å and one Ni/O/N with 2.27 Å bong length, which means one Ni atom is most likely coordinated with four N atoms and one O atom to form Ni-N4-O sites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. S5a) also validates that the Ni species coordinated with O and N atoms. The high-resolution N 1s (Fig. 1f) spectrum containing five types of N species (pyridinic N at 398.4 eV, pyrrolic N at 400.0 eV, graphitic N at 400.7 eV, oxidized N at 402.1 eV and the peak at 399.2 eV) indicates the N species are coordinated with Ni atoms to form Ni-N x bond [19]. Notably, pyridinic N comprises 29.6% of nitrogen, which is the most abundant among the above five N species. The pyridinic N doping in carbon matrix can lead to the generation of more desired defects and active sites, which accelerate rapid electronic transport and enhance the chemical affinity to polysulfides, to promote the cycling performance of Li-S batteries [20]. The introduction of Ni single atom structure increases the I D/I G value (Fig. S7) and the specific surface area of the material (Fig. S8), but does not change the morphology of the samples (Figs. S9 and S10). Such a high surface with a porous lamellar structure of SANi-N4-O/NC is favorable to get a high sulfur loading rate (Fig. S11). Moreover, all elements of SANi-N4-O/NC@S and NC@S are uniformly distributed after compounding with sulfur (Figs. S12 and S13). The electrocatalytic effect of SANi-N4-O/NC host on the LiPSs conversion process is further investigated in Li2S6 symmetric cell and Li-S coin cells. As shown in Fig. 2 (a) and Fig. S14, compared with NC electrode, the symmetrical cell with SANi-N4-O/NC electrode performed a higher current response and larger peak area at 1 mV s−1, demonstrating faster LiPSs redox kinetics on the surface of SANi-N4-O/NC electrode [21]. In Fig. S15(a), the symmetrical cells with SANi-N4-O/NC electrode exhibit supreme current response in both reduction and oxidation process, and the higher exchange current density of 0.229 mA cm−2 when compared with that of NC (0.0186 mA cm−2), revealing enhanced reaction kinetics and better electrocatalytic activity toward LiPSs conversion on SANi-N4-O/NC surface. Moreover, in chronoamperometry curves (Fig. S15b), the SANi-N4-O/NC electrode delivers higher current responses than that of NC electrode, which implies a beneficial effect of accelerating the redox conversion of LiPSs. In Fig. 2(b), CV curves of SANi-N4-O/NC@S display a twin oxidation peak at around 2.31 V (peak A) in the charging process, the peak at lower potential relate to the formation of Li2S n (n> 2), the peak at higher potential associated with the formation of S8 [22]. In discharging process, both CV curves show two reduction peaks at about 2.28 V (peak C1) and 2.06 V (peak C2), which attribute to the reduction of solid-state S8 to soluble high-order Li2S x (4 < x < 8) and high-order Li2S x to insoluble Li2S/Li2S2, respectively [23,24]. Compared with both cathodic and anodic peaks in the case of NC@S cell, the SANi-N4-O/NC@S cell shows much sharper redox peaks and the corresponding cathodic peaks appear positive shift while anodic peak appears to negative shift, indicating a more sufficient LiPSs conversions and a decrease of the polarization [25]. The potential shift of all three peaks also proves that the SANi-N4-O/NC can boost the conversion between liquid-state Li2S x and solid-state Li2S/Li2S2 during Li-S cell operation. The catalytic effect of SANi-N4-O/NC was further investigated by comparing the Tafel plots [26]. As shown in Fig. 2(c), SANi-N4-O/NC@S electrode shows smaller Tafel slopes than NC@S electrode at all three reduction and oxidation plateaus, indicating fast redox conversion of polysulfide, advantageous Li2S deposition, and rapid oxidation of Li2S on the SANi-N4-O/NC host. The obtained cyclic voltammetric curves in the 1.7–2.8 V region at 0.2–0.5 mV s−1 were observed in Fig. S16. Besides, the Li+ diffusion coefficients based on the Randles Sevick equation were calculated to study kinetic improvement. The fitted straight slopes of peak current (I p) vs. ν0.5 on SANi-N4-O/NC@S for all the A, C1 and C2 peaks are obviously larger than those of NC@S (Fig. S16), corresponding to higher DLi + in SANi-N4-O/NC@S electrode (Table S2) [27]. Therefore, the Ni single atoms structure on N doped carbon facilitates Li+ transfer. Kinetic for LiPSs conversion are also explored by potentiostatic charging tests at slightly higher overpotential to motivate full dissociation of insoluble Li2S to soluble LiPSs. In Fig. 2(d), the dissociation of Li2S on SANi-N4-O/NC surface proceeds much faster with much higher oxidation current than that on NC surface, indicating a lower oxidation overpotential in LiPSs conversion. The EIS spectra of SANi-N4-O/NC@S and NC@S electrode are presented in Fig. 2(e). The EIS results reveal the smaller internal impedance of SANi-N4-O/NC@S electrode than that of NC@S electrode, confirming the enhanced charge transfer kinetics [28,29]. It manifests the conductive N doped carbon and the Ni single atoms synergistically result in better charge transfer of SANi-N4-O/NC@S electrode, which may benefit the electrocatalytic conversion of LiPSs [30]. From the initial charge and discharge profiles in Fig. 2(f), the SANi-N4-O/NC@S electrode presents a lower polarization potential with a smaller charging/discharging overpotential compared with the NC@S electrode, which can be attributed to the effectiveness of Ni single atoms for catalyzing the delithiation reaction of Li2S [31]. In order to investigate the LiPSs trapping ability of SANi-N4-O/NC sheets, UV–vis spectroscopy and visual adsorption experiments were carried out (Fig. 3 a). It can be clearly observed that the original LiPSs solution (0.02 M) presents a deep brown color, which becomes light yellow and yellow after 30 min adsorption by SANi-N4-O/NC and NC, respectively. Besides, the decreased intensity of absorption peaks from NC and SANi-N4-O/NC in UV–vis measurement reveals that NC can adsorb LiPSs (after 10 h) to a certain extent and Ni single atoms embedded carbon matrix can further improve the adsorption of LiPSs. The DFT calculation also demonstrates a stronger interaction between different polysulfides/sulfide species and SANi-N4-O/NC than NC (Fig. 5b). The underlying chemical interactions of SANi-N4-O/NC and NC before and after Li2S6 adsorption were further analyzed by XPS. In the origin LiPSs sample, only one peak which attributed to Li-S bond (55.5 eV) in Li 1s spectra appears [32]. As evidenced by XPS of Li2S6 treated SANi-N4-O/NC and NC, the additional peaks at 56.5 eV and 57.5 eV are assigned to Li-N bond and Li-O bond, respectively [32,33]. The peak at 163.1/162.2 eV and 163.8/164.3/165.0 eV in S 2p spectra (Fig. S23) of SANi-N4-O/NC sample can be assigned to terminal sulfur (ST -1) and bridging sulfur (SB 0) in LiPSs which presents higher than its standard value [33]. To further probe the role of SANi-N4-O/NC in benefitting sulfur redox reaction, the rate performance of Li-S batteries was investigated (Fig. 3c). With 92.5% sulfur loading of SANi-N4-O/NC@S (Fig. S11) material, Li-S battery assembled with SANi-N4-O/NC@S cathode material delivered discharge capacities of 1321, 1212, 1115, 1015 and 907 mA h g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 C, respectively. When decreasing current density back to 2.0, 1.0, 0.5 and 0.2 C, a corresponding high reversible capacity of 993, 1080, 1151 and 1239 mA h g−1 was maintained. By contrast, the Li-S battery with NC@S cathode material could only deliver capacities of 1131, 868, 789, 716, 623, 688, 754, 806 and 865 mA h g−1 at the same rate current, demonstrating the enhanced conversion kinetics and better reversibility of SANi-N4-O/NC host [15]. The better electrochemical reversibility of SANi-N4-O/NC@S was also verified by charge/discharge curves from 0.2 to 5.0 C in Fig. S24(a and b). In comparison with the case of NC@S electrode (Fig. S24e and f), the SANi-N4-O/NC@S electrode well maintains flatter and longer plateaus at each current density (Fig. S25a and b). Moreover, SANi-N4-O/NC@S cathode exhibit a lower potential gap than that of NC@S cathode (Fig. S25c), indicating the fast reaction kinetic [34,35]. As exhibited in Fig. S26(b), the SANi-N4-O/NC@S electrode delivered a first discharge capacity of 1169 mA h g−1 at 2.0 C, after 500 cycles, a reversible capacity of 700 mA h g−1 has remained. In Fig. 3(e), the first discharge capacity was 1040 mA h g−1 at 5.0 C, and the reversible capacity of 592 mA h g−1 with the capacity fading rate per cycle of 0.043% after 1000 cycles was retained. Further, the battery with SANi-N4-O/NC@S cathode shows a high coulombic efficiency close to 100% through the long-term cycling at both 2.0 C and 5.0 C. Compared to the cell with NC@S cathode, the improved cycling stability of SANi-N4-O/NC@S electrode indicates the efficient catalyst of SANi-N4-O/NC [6,36]. To demonstrate the commercialization potential of the SANi-N4-O/NC@S cathode, the investigation of battery performance under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte condition is necessary. The amount of electrolyte for the coin cell was 40 μL with sulfur loadings of 5.8 mg cm−2, corresponding to electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios of 6.1 μL mg−1, respectively. The cycling stability of the cathode with high sulfur loading is shown in Fig. 3(d), the capacity of SANi-N4-O/NC@S cathode after 130 cycles remained 3.8 mA h cm−2 for sulfur loadings of 5.8 mg cm−2, respectively. The charge/discharge profiles of the above electrode maintained the typical shape at 0.5 C in Fig. S27, indicating an effective redox conversion reaction of LiPSs on SANi-N4-O/NC. In situ X-ray diffraction was performed to further understand the detail redox mechanism of SANi-N4-O/NC@S cathode through charge/discharge process (Fig. 4 a). As exhibited in Fig. 4(b and c), the sharp crystalline peaks of α-S8 can be found obviously (JCPDF No. 085–0799) [36]. With the process of reduction reaction, the α-S8 peak fades quickly meanwhile two broad peaks appear at about 25.5° and 28.5°, which belong to the long chain polysulfides [37,38]. Almost no change can be found for these two peaks through the redox process except the intensity and broadness of the peaks, indicating polysulfides absorbed on the surface of electrode or separator with the discharge/charge process. The complete decrease of α-S8 peak also verifies the sufficient reaction between S8 and lithium ions. With further lithiation process, the new peak which results from the generation of Li2S appears at about 27.0° (JCPDF No. 023–0369) [38]. For subsequent oxidation reaction, the intensity of cubic Li2S peak gradually decreases, and two peaks appear at around 24.5° and 25.9° which belongs to the formation of β-S8 (JCPDF No. 071–0137) [39]. First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were carried out to further clarify the mechanism for improved conversion kinetics of Ni single atom catalyst in Li-S batteries. The Ni-N4-O moiety is doped in a graphene sheet (mimicking SANi-N4-O/NC) that has been reported in our previous work [16], and nitrogen doped on pristine graphene (donated as NC) models were constructed. To gain an in-depth analyzing of the enhancing electrochemical reaction kinetics on SANi-N4-O/NC surface, the complete reaction including the formation of Li2S from S8 was considered and shown in Fig. 5 (a). The detailed optimized structures of corresponding intermediates on the SANi-N4-O/NC substrate were shown in the inset, while other configurations can be found in Fig. S18. It can be noted that the first reduction step of S8 to the Li2S8 shows a spontaneous exothermic reaction on all the substrates. The result clearly shows that the free energy value is lower on SANi-N4-O/NC surface compared to NC surface in the following four endothermic reaction steps, indicating the improved kinetic conversion of the LiPSs on SANi-N4-O/NC in discharging process [40]. When Li2S2 is reduced to Li2S in the last reduction step, the relative Gibbs free energy reaches the biggest value in the whole reduction process on both substrates, demonstrating that the Li2S2 to Li2S lithiation process is the rate-limiting step through discharging process. The lower positive Gibbs energy barrier from Li2S2 to Li2S on SANi-N4-O/NC (0.73 eV) than the case of NC (0.89 eV) could be attributed to the unfilled d orbitals of oxidized Ni sites by chemical interaction [13,16]. The data implies that Li2S2 to Li2S precipitation process is more thermodynamically favorable on SANi-N4-O/NC surface and thus improves the rate performance of Li-S batteries. Moreover, the binding energy as the significant parameter reveals anchoring ability of the carbon matrix to LiPSs was shown in Fig. 5(b). The higher binding energy between the SANi-N4-O/NC and LiPSs than that of NC also verifies the stronger immobilization of the LiPSs in charge/discharge process, indicating the decrease of the shuttle effect. To attain more insight understanding into interactions between LiPSs and substrate, the adsorption of Li2S on the surface of SANi-N4-O/NC and NC was modeled. Fig. 5(c) displays that Li2S on SANi-N4-O/NC and NC adopts a bridged adsorption structure, whereby the terminal Li atoms are bonded to coordinated N atoms or O atoms. Besides, the S atoms are bonded to O sites which can be found in Fig. S19 and indicate the high binding energy. The strong anchor of LiPSs is helpful to effectively suppress their migration thus inhibiting the shuttle effect. Fig. 5(d) is the corresponding slice through Li-S-Li atoms from Li2S molecule. It is notable that O sites induced much more electron density in the middle of OS bonds, implying of a strong covalence between S and surface O atoms. Thus, SANi-N4-O/NC can significantly reduce the reduction barrier of LiPSs and decomposition barrier of Li2S. Therefore, the conductive NC can not only embed with Ni-N4-O active sites, but also ensure the fast charge transfer in the redox process. Furthermore, the active Ni-N4-O centers of SANi-N4-O/NC can anchor the LiPSs and catalyze its kinetic conversion simultaneously. Consequently, the SANi-N4-O/NC host of active materials in cathode effectively improves the electrochemical performance of the Li-S batteries (Fig. 5e). 4 Conclusions In summary, we developed a porous 2D N-doped carbon electrocatalyst consisting of atomically disperse Ni active centers with Ni-N4-O coordinated structure. Attributed to the large surface area, affluent porous architecture, and abundant high active sites, the obtained coin batteries based on SANi-N4-O/NC@S electrode with the high sulfur loading of 92.5% exhibit improved rate performance and cycling stability. Experimental observations and density theoretical calculations reveal that improved catalytic activity derived from optimized electron configuration and enhanced electron transfer ability of Ni single atoms active centers, which synergistically promotes the LiPSs conversion kinetics. Our single atom catalyst design may open a new avenue for lithium sulfur batteries with a fast electrochemical reaction to circumvent the shuttle effect and sluggish electrochemical kinetics.

        "dc:description": "Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with high theoretical energy density are promising advanced energy storage devices. However, shuttling of dissolute lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) and sluggish conversion kinetics impede their applications. Herein, single nickel (Ni) atoms on two-dimensional (2D) nitrogen(N)-doped carbon with Ni-N4-O overcoordinated structure (SANi-N4-O/NC) are prepared and firstly used as a sulfur host of Li-S batteries. Due to the efficient polysulfides traps and highly LiPSs conversion effect of SANi-N4-O/NC, the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries obviously improved. The batteries can well operate even under high sulfur loading (5.8 mg cm−2) and lean electrolyte (6.1 μL mg−1) condition. Meanwhile, density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that Ni single atom’s active sites decrease the energy barriers of conversion reactions from Li2S8 to Li2S due to the strong interaction between SANi-N4-O/NC and LiPSs. Thus, the kinetic conversion of LiPSs was accelerated and the shuttle effect is suppressed on SANi-N4-O/NC host. This study provides a new design strategy for a 2D structure with single-atom overcoordinated active sites to facilitate the fast kinetic conversion of LiPSs for Li-S cathode.",
