DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60185-4 Preparation of a Nickel Molybdenum Carbide Catalyst and Its Activity in the Dry Reforming of Methane Taro HIROSE 1 , Yasushi OZAWA 2 , Masatoshi NAGAI 1, * 1 Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, 2-24 Nakamachi, Koganei, Tokyo 184-8588, Japan 2 Energy Engineering Research Laboratory, Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry, 2-6-1 Nagasaka, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 240-0196, Japan Abstract: Nickel molybdenum carbide catalysts were prepared and their activities in the CO 2 reforming of methane at a low CO 2 /CH 4 reactant ratio were investigated using a microreactor at atmospheric pressure and at 973 K. The effect of the catalyst preparation method and the Ni/Mo ratio on the increase in catalyst life and the promotion of catalytic activity were investigated using N 2 adsorption, X-ray dif- fraction, temperature-programmed carburization, temperature-programmed reaction, and a reforming reaction. The 25Ni75Mo catalyst that was carburized at 813 K exhibited the highest hydrogen formation ability and gave the least carbon deposition. The incomplete carburiza- tion of the Mo oxide species in the catalyst that was carburized at a lower temperature gradually gave a more active carburized species. The NiMoO x C y in the catalyst was more active in hydrogen formation during the dry reforming of methane while È•-Mo 2 C and È˜-Mo 3 C 2 were less active. Key words: catalyst activation; catalyst selectivity; fuel; dry reforming; methane The methane reforming process produces a synthetic gas that can be used to make hydrogen for fuel cells and industrial chemicals. However, this conventional process produces large amounts of carbon dioxide, which is a cause of global warm- ing. The dry reforming of methane (CH 4 + CO 2 Äº 2CO + 2H 2 ) is applicable to the Fischer-Tropsch reaction, to diethyl ether synthesis, and to the reduction of carbon dioxide. Although noble metal catalysts and nickel catalysts have been used for synthetic gas to obtain a high degree of conversion during CO 2 reforming [1â€“6], few studies have been conducted on methane reforming with and without CO 2 on carbide or oxycarbide catalysts [7â€“11]. In these studies, the catalysts are readily de- activated by coke deposition during methane reforming and they transform into carbides in the presence of graphite. Therefore, the addition of cobalt to molybdenum carbides was studied during CO 2 reforming to reduce carbon formation [12â€“14]. In addition, Shu et al. [15] reported that 5% CO 2 among reactions of 1%â€“6% CO 2 that were added to a 10% Ar-90% CH 4 feed was effective for the CO 2 reforming of CH 4 on Mo carbide. In this study, we investigated the CO 2 reforming of methane at a low CO 2 /CH 4 reactant ratio on a nickel molybdenum car- bide catalyst at atmospheric pressure at 973 K using a micro- reactor. We determined the effects of catalyst preparation and the Ni/Mo ratio on the extension of catalyst life and the pro- motion of catalytic activity. We also discuss the active species on the basis of X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-pro- grammed carburization (TPC), and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) results. 1 Experimental Aqueous solutions of the Ni and Mo precursors of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 Â·6H 2 O (Kishida Chemical Co., 98%) and (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 Â·4H 2 O (Kishida Chemical Co., 99%) were pre- pared in water, dried at 393 K overnight, and calcined at 773 K for 5 h in air. Catalyst carburization and the experimental re- actions were performed in a quartz microreactor at atmospheric Taro HIROSE et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 771â€“776 pressure. Ni and Mo oxides (0.2 g) were placed in the micro- reactor and pretreated with a stream of air (66.7 ml/min) at 773 K for 1 h and carburized with a stream of a 20% CH 4 -80% H 2 mixture (66.7 ml/min) at 773â€“873 K for 1 h. The gas was then purged with He (15 ml/min) and changed to a mixed gas (18 ml/min) containing 33% CH 4 and 1.1% CO 2 in He, which was supplied to the catalyst for the reforming reaction at 973 K for 6 h. Three kinds of nickel molybdenum carbide catalysts were prepared: 25NiMo, 50NiMo, and 75NiMo and these represent catalysts with Ni/Mo mole ratios of 25/75, 50/50, and 75/25, respectively. The reaction products and feed were analyzed using quadrupole mass spectrometry (Quadstar 422, Balzers Co.), which was connected on-line. H 2 , CH 4 , H 2 O, C 2 H 2 , C 2 H 4 , CO (or C 2 H 6 or C 2 H 4 ), C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 8 , CO 2 , and C 6 H 6 were de- termined by their mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) of 2, 15, 18, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 44, and 78, respectively. The CH 4 conversion and H 2 formation rate were then obtained from this mass spectrometric data using He as the internal standard. The BET surface area of the catalysts was then measured using an Om- nisorp 100CX (Beckman Coulter Co.) before and after the reaction. The XRD patterns were also measured using a RINT2100 PC/V (Rigaku Co.) with Cu K Ä® radiation. The peaks were identified using ASTM cards. The carbide structure of the catalysts was then investigated by TPC with the same experi- mental setup used for the reforming reaction. The Ni and Mo oxides (0.2 g) were pretreated with a stream of air (66.7 ml/min) at 773 K for 1 h, cooled to 573 K with He (15 ml/min), and then heated by TPC from 573 to 1073 K at 1 K/min using a mixed gas stream (30 ml/min) composed of 6.7% CH 4 and 26.7% H 2 in He. The active catalyst species was then investi- gated using TPR. After catalyst carburization or the reforming reaction, the catalyst was cooled to room temperature in situ using He (15 ml/min) and then heated by TPR in situ from room temperature to 1273 K at 5 K/min with a stream of 10% H 2 in He (15 ml/min). 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Dry reforming reaction All the catalysts gave a CO 2 conversion of approximately 100% for the dry reforming reaction at 973 K. The H 2 forma- tion rate and CH 4 conversion over each catalyst rapidly dropped after the start of the reaction and soon reached the steady state or gradually increased. The H 2 formation rate and CH 4 conversion in the dry reforming reaction over the 50NiMo catalyst that was carburized from 773 to 873 K are shown in Fig. 1. For the catalysts carburized at 773â€“798 K, the rate and conversion at the start of the reaction was high and was fol- lowed by a rapid decrease and then a gradual increase until the end of the experiment. In contrast, for the 810â€“873 K carbur- ized catalysts the H 2 formation rate at the start of the reaction was low followed by slight change and then a steady state was reached, while the CH 4 conversion at the start of the reaction was high followed by a rapid decrease and then finally reaching a steady state. The 786 K carburized 50NiMo catalyst exhibited the highest H 2 formation rate and CH 4 conversion at 6 h on stream while the rate and the conversion roughly decreased with an increase in carburizing temperature. The H 2 formation rate and CH 4 conversion in the dry re- forming reaction at 6 h on stream for 25NiMo, 50NiMo, and 75NiMo are shown in Fig. 2. At the same carburizing tem- perature (786 and 798 K, respectively) the H 2 formation rate decreased and the CH 4 conversion increased as the Ni/Mo ratio increased while the CO 2 conversion for all the catalysts re- mained at approximately 100%. The H 2 formation rate for the 75NiMo catalyst decreased as the carburizing temperature increased while the rate for the 25NiMo catalyst increased. CH 4 conversion decreased as the carburizing temperature in- creased for all the catalysts. Low conversion of CH 4 leads to low carbon deposition because almost all the CO 2 reacts with CH 4 for all the catalysts and further CH 4 conversion corre- sponds to the decomposition to carbonaceous compounds. Small amounts of C 2 H 6 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 2 , and C 6 H 6 were observed for all the catalysts at 6 h after the reforming reaction but no relation was found between these amounts and the Ni/Mo ratio. As a result, the 813 K carburized 25NiMo catalyst exhibited the highest H 2 formation rate with the lowest carbon deposi- tion. 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 773 K 786 K 798 K 810 K 823 K 873 K H 2 f o r m a t i o n r a t e ( m m o l / m i n ) 0123456 50 60 70 80 90 100 773 K 786 K 798 K 810 K 823 K 873 K C H 4 c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) Time on stream (h) Fig. 1.

Taro HIROSE et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 771â€“776 2.2 TPC, TPR, XRD, and BET analyses The TPC profiles of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 3. Water formation peaks were observed at 677, 719, and 886 K while the CO (or C 2 H 6 or C 2 H 4 ) formation peak was at 906 K in the TPC measurement for 25NiMo. For 50NiMo and 75NiMo the water peak at 677 K became broader. An increase in the Ni/Mo ratio lowered the water formation temperature from 886 to 870 K and the CO formation temperature from 906 to 875 K during TPC. XRD patterns of the 50NiMo catalyst after TPC are shown in Fig. 4. Nickel molybdenum oxycarbide (NiMoO x C y ) and molybdenum oxides (MoO 2 ) were observed at a carburization temperature of 773 K but NiMoO x C y and Ni metal, without MoO 2 formation, were detected at 786 K. At 873 K, È•-Mo 2 C and Ni metal were observed and NiMoO x C y was absent. Therefore, the oxidic catalysts were insufficiently carburized below 780 K and NiMoO x C y was formed below 770 K. Com- bining the TPC was evident because of the decomposed oxy- gen from the transformation of MoO 3 to MoO 2 . Additionally water formation at approximately 720 K was due to the trans- formation of NiMoO 4 to NiMoO x C y , and water and CO (or C 2 H 6 or C 2 H 4 ) at approximately 880 K was formed by the oxygen and carbon from the transformation of NiMoO x C y to È•-Mo 2 C and Ni metal. Although NiMoO x C y was not detected at 873 K in the XRD of 50NiMo, TPC data shows that water and CO continued to evolve up to approximately 900 K (Fig. 3). From these results, it is evident that NiMoO x C y is present on the surface. Consequently, the increase in Ni content lowered the transformation temperature of NiMoO x C y as it produced È•-Mo 2 C and Ni metal. The TPR profiles of the 50NiMo catalyst that was carburized at 786 and 873 K before the reaction are shown in Fig. 5. Methane was created in the reaction between NiMoO x C y and H 2 at 715 K and after carburizing as shown by the XRD of the catalyst that was carburized at 786 K (Fig. 4). For the catalyst that was carburized at 873 K, the methane formation peak attributed to NiMoO x C y decreased and a new methane forma- tion peak was present at 920 K. These were deconvoluted into peaks of È•-Mo 2 C (860 K) and pyrolytic carbon (960 K) and the identification was based on a previous report [13]. By com- bining the results obtained at the start of the dry reforming reaction (Fig. 1), NiMoO x C y is shown to be a more active 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 75NiMo-773 K 75NiMo-786 K 50NiMo-786 K 50NiMo-798 K 25NiMo-798 K 25NiMo-813 K 75NiMo-773 K 75NiMo-786 K 50NiMo-786 K 50NiMo-798 K 25NiMo-798 K 25NiMo-813 K H 2 f o r m a t i o n r a t e ( m m o l / m i n ) 770 780 790 800 810 820 40 50 60 70 80 90 C H 4 c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) Carburizing temperature (K) Fig. 2.

Taro HIROSE et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 771â€“776 species than È•-Mo 2 C during H 2 formation in the dry reforming of CH 4 . High H 2 formation and high CH 4 conversion with a low CO 2 /CH 4 ratio at the start of the reaction for the catalyst car- burized at 786 K indicates that NiMoO x C y promotes the dry reforming reaction of CH 4 as well as the direct decomposition reaction of CH 4 . Additionally, low H 2 formation with a high CH 4 conversion at the start of the reaction for the catalyst that was carburized at 873 K suggests that È•-Mo 2 C can promote a reverse water gas shift reaction (CO 2 + H 2 Äº H 2 O + CO). The TPR profiles of the 50NiMo catalyst that was carburized at 786 K before the reaction and at 1 h after the reaction are shown in Fig. 6. After a 1 h reaction the peak at 715 K disap- peared and the broad CH 4 formation peak was present at 1039 K, which was deconvoluted into È•-Mo 2 C (860 K), pyrolytic carbon (960 K), È˜-Mo 3 C 2 (1039 K), and graphitic carbon (1149 K) peaks. These identifications were also based on a previous report [13]. This result indicates that the rapid drop in H 2 for- mation rate and CH 4 conversion at the start of the reaction (Fig. 1) is related to the transformation of NiMoO x C y to È•-Mo 2 C and È˜-Mo 3 C 2 . This proves that NiMoO x C y is more active than È•-Mo 2 C and È˜-Mo 3 C 2 in the dry reforming of CH 4 . XRD patterns of the 50NiMo catalysts obtained after the reforming reaction are shown in Fig. 7. After the reaction, Ni metal was observed for each catalyst carburized from 773 to 873 K. Graphitic carbon was found to have a higher peak for the catalysts that were carburized at lower temperatures, e.g., the incomplete carburization at lower temperature promoted H 2 formation together with carbon deposition during reforming. Moreover, MoO 2 has very low activity during methane dry reforming [16â€“18]. The oxidized catalyst of the NiO-MgO solid solution showed no reforming activity during the auto- thermal CO 2 reforming of methane whereas the catalyst that was reduced to Ni 0 on the surface exhibited reforming activity [19]. Although MoO 2 was not identified in the XRD of the 50NiMo catalyst that was carburized at 786 K (neither was NiO between 773 and 786 K, as shown in Fig. 4), the oxidized Mo and/or Ni remained on the catalyst that was carburized in- completely at 773â€“798 K. It gradually transformed into the more active carburized species or metallic Ni during the re- forming reactions leading to a gradual increase in the H 2 for- mation rate and in CH 4 conversion (Fig. 1). Brungs et al. [17] reported that the main route for catalyst deactivation in the dry reforming of methane over supported molybdenum carbide was likely to be the oxidation of Mo 2 C to MoO 2 . However, Lacheen et al. [18] showed that CH 4 conversion over MoC x -ZSM-5 does not decrease after 15 ks at a CO 2 /CH 4 reactant ratio of 0.05 but it does decrease at ratios above 0.1 and this is caused by the transformation of MoC x to MoO x . Because the ratio used in our experiment was 0.033, which is lower than 0.05, such an oxidation does not occur during the CO 2 reforming of methane. 400 600 800 1000 1200 C H 4 i n t e n s i t y Temperature (K) 715 860 960 (1) (2) Fig. 5.

XRD patterns of the 50NiMo catalysts after the reaction and carburized at different temperatures. Taro HIROSE et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 771â€“776 XRD patterns for the 25NiMo, 50NiMo, and 75NiMo cata- lysts were obtained after the reforming reaction and are shown in Fig. 8. Nickel and graphitic carbon were formed as the Ni/Mo ratio increased. This type of carbon formation is in agreement with the calculations of Sehested et al. [20] who found that carbon formation on a Mo 2 C catalyst requires more Gibbs-free energy than a nickel catalyst. This result means that a molybdenum carbide catalyst is more resistant to carbon formation than nickel catalysts. Additionally, an increase in the Ni/Mo ratio decreased the transformation temperature of Ni- MoO x C y to È•-Mo 2 C and Ni metal, as determined by the TPC measurement. Therefore, the high Ni/Mo ratio enhances the decomposition of the more active NiMoO x C y to the less active È•-Mo 2 C and Ni metal. Furthermore, the high Ni/Mo ratio re- duced H 2 formation because of an increase in water formation. Xiao et al. [21] reported that pretreating NiMoAl catalysts using carburization can increase catalyst stability while large amounts of Mo dopants have a damaging effect and this is probably because of carbon deposition caused by CH 4 de- composition. They proposed that the formation of NiMoO 4 is probably responsible for catalyst deactivation. In contrast, we found that NiMoO 4 transformed into NiMoO x C y during car- burizing and it was not identified before and after the reforming reaction because of the low CO 2 /CH 4 ratio, which was much lower than the ratio of 1 that was the mentioned in the study. XRD patterns of the catalysts that formed after the reforming reaction and that were carburized at different temperatures are also shown in Fig. 8. The 25NiMo catalyst that was carburized at 798 K produced more graphitic carbon than the catalyst carburized at 813 K while the XRD pattern of the 75NiMo catalyst that was carburized at 773 K accorded with that at 786 K. As a result, the high carburizing temperature for the low Ni/Mo ratio catalyst increased H 2 formation and low amounts of water and carbon were formed. The BET surface area of the 50NiMo catalyst before and after the reforming reaction is shown in Fig. 9. The surface area decreased after the reaction because of the transformation of the oxide to a carbide or metal and because of catalyst sinter- ing. In addition, the surface area roughly decreased with an increase in the carburizing temperature. This is one of the reasons for the H 2 formation rate and the decrease in CH 4 conversion with an increase in the carburizing temperature. 3 Conclusions The CO 2 reforming of methane at a low CO 2 /CH 4 reactant ratio on nickel molybdenum carbide catalysts prepared at various carburizing temperatures and Ni/Mo ratios was inves- tigated using XRD, TPC, and TPR. For the 50NiMo catalysts carburized at 810â€“873 K the H 2 formation rate and CH 4 con- version reached a steady state after rapidly dropping initially during the reaction while they gradually increased for the catalysts carburized at 773â€“798 K. At the same carburizing temperature, the H 2 formation rate decreased and the CH 4 conversion increased as the Ni/Mo ratio increased. NiMoO x C y was more active for H 2 formation while È•-Mo 2 C and È˜-Mo 3 C 2 were less active. The incomplete carburization of the Mo oxide species and/or Ni oxide species in the catalyst carburized at a lower temperature gradually led to their transformation into a more active carburized species or metallic Ni species among the studied reforming reactions leading to a gradual increase in the H 2 formation rate and CH 4 conversion. At the same car- burizing temperature the H 2 formation rate increased and CH 4 conversion decreased as the Ni/Mo ratio decreased. The de- crease in the Ni/Mo ratio retarded the decomposition of Ni- MoO x C y into È•-Mo 2 C and Ni metal. In addition, the high car- burizing temperature used for the low Ni/Mo ratio catalyst 20 30 40 50 60 Graphitic carbon Ni-metal K-Mo 3 C 2 E-Mo 2 C I n t e n s i t y 2T/( o ) (1) (3) (4) (5) (2) Fig. 8.

Consequently, the 25NiMo catalyst that was carburized at 813 K gave the best H 2 formation behavior and it deposited the lowest amount of carbon.

Tel: +81-42-388-7060; Fax: +81-42-381-4201 Nickel molybdenum carbide catalysts were prepared and their activities in the CO2 reforming of methane at a low CO2/CH4 reactant ratio were investigated using a microreactor at atmospheric pressure and at 973 K. The effect of the catalyst preparation method and the Ni/Mo ratio on the increase in catalyst life and the promotion of catalytic activity were investigated using N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed carburization, temperature-programmed reaction, and a reforming reaction. The 25Ni75Mo catalyst that was carburized at 813 K exhibited the highest hydrogen formation ability and gave the least carbon deposition. The incomplete carburization of the Mo oxide species in the catalyst that was carburized at a lower temperature gradually gave a more active carburized species. The NiMoO x C y in the catalyst was more active in hydrogen formation during the dry reforming of methane while β-Mo2C and η-Mo3C2 were less active. Graphical abstract Nickel molybdenum carbide catalysts were prepared and tested for methane dry reforming. The oxycarbide, NiMoO x C y , was found to be a more active species for hydrogen formation than β-Mo2C and η-Mo3C2.
