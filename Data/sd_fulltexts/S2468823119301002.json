Graphical abstract Ln2Ti2O7 (Ln = La, Pr, Sm, and Y) and Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 catalysts were prepared using the co-precipitation and incipient wetness impregnation methods, respectively. XRD and Raman results reveal that with the decrease in r A/r B ratio of A2B2O7 (A = La, Pr, Sm, and Y; B = Ti), the crystal structure transformed from the monoclinic layered perovskite (La2Ti2O7 and Pr2Ti2O7) to the ordered pyrochlore (Sm2Ti2O7 and Y2Ti2O7). H2-TPR results demonstrate that the active Ni species had a stronger interaction with Sm2Ti2O7 or Y2Ti2O7 than with La2Ti2O7 or Pr2Ti2O7. Therefore, smaller Ni crystallites with larger active metallic surface areas could be formed in the Ni/Sm2Ti2O7 and Ni/Y2Ti2O7 catalysts. XPS results indicate that the oxygen vacancies and oxygen mobility were also gradually enhanced with the decrease in r A/r B ratio. As a consequence, the Ni/Y2Ti2O7 sample exhibited the highest catalytic activity and the best coke-resistant ability in the steam reforming of methane for hydrogen production among all of the catalysts. It is concluded that the change in A-site element influenced the structures of Ln2Ti2O7 significantly, which ultimately affected catalytic performance of Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 for the steam reforming of methane. Keywords Ln2Ti2O7 Pyrochlore Monoclinic layered perovskite Oxygen vacancies Steam reforming of methane Coke-resistant ability 1 Introduction As one kind of high-quality clean energy, hydrogen energy has attracted more and more attention. At present, hydrogen comes from many sources, among which steam reforming of methane (SRM) is one of the most effective pathways for hydrogen production and widely applied in industry for several decades. The major reactions of SRM can be described as follows [1–3]: CH4 + H2O → CO + 3H2; CO + H2O → CO2 + H2; and CH4 + 2H2O → CO2 + 4H2. Obviously, the SRM is a strong endothermic reaction. According to the previous research work, noble metals (e.g., Pt [4,5], Rh [6], and Pd [7]) exhibit superior catalytic activity and excellent coke resistance, but the high cost makes them impossible for industrial applications. In comparison, the Ni-based catalysts are widely used in the SRM reaction for hydrogen production owning to their good initial activity and relatively low price [8,9]. Nevertheless, the major deficiency of Ni-based catalysts is the severe carbon deposition, which could lead to an obvious deactivation during the reforming process [10,11]. Many efforts have been made on improving the anti-coking ability of Ni-based catalysts to obtain better catalytic performance. Previous studies have shown that choosing a suitable support could intensify the strong interaction of the support with the active metal, and stabilize the Ni particle sizes, hence inhibiting the deposition of carbon [12–14] In recent years, rare earth composite oxides have been extensively investigated as supports for methane reforming to production of hydrogen, especially the cubic pyrochlore-type oxides (A2B2O7) that possess superior thermal stability, good oxygen ion conductivity, and a large amount of oxygen vacancies [15–19]. In the cubic pyrochlore structure, the A site is usually a larger-radium trivalent rare-earth metal with a 8-fold coordination with oxygen, whereas the B site is a smaller-radium tetravalent transition metal with a 6-fold coordination with oxygen [20–24]. It was reported that the partial substitution of La2Zr2O7 with Ru, Rh, Pt or Ni increased formation of more mobile oxygen species, which enhanced the coke-resistant ability during the methane reforming process [16,25–27]. Using the steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis to study the dry reforming of methane (DRM) over the Rh-substituted La2Zr2O7 catalysts, Bruce and coworkers [26,28] pointed out that not only Rh, but also all of the surface metal atoms participated in the DRM reaction as the active sites. However, less attention has been paid on the use of pure pyrochlore as support for methane reforming reactions. Tada et al. [29] used the Ce2Zr2O7 as support to prepare the Ni/Ce2Zr2O7 catalysts, and observed a high catalytic activity and stability during the SRM process. Previously, our group first synthesized the Y2Zr2O7 materials using the different methods and then used them as support to generate the supported Ni catalysts. We found that for steam reforming of methane, results shows that the Ni/Y2Zr2O7 derived from a glycine-nitrate combustion route exhibited good activity, stability, and coke resistance in the SRM reaction [19]. In comparison with the traditional industrial Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, the La2Zr2O7- and La2Sn2O7-supported Ni catalysts possessed better coke-resistant performance in the SRM reaction [15]. In addition, our previous results also demonstrated that substitution of the A- or B-site of A2B2O7 gave rise to a change in structure, which could in turn influence the catalytic performance of the A2B2O7-supported Ni catalysts for the SRM reaction [15,18,19]. To gain a better understanding on the relation of the support structure to the catalytic activity, Ln2Ti2O7 (Ln = La, Pr, Sm, and Y) were first fabricated via the co-precipitation route and employed as support to generate supported Ni catalysts. It was found that the difference in A-site element led to the changes in pyrochlore structure and physicochemical property of Ln2Ti2O7; and the Ni/Y2Ti2O7 sample exhibited the highest catalytic activity and the best coke-resistant ability. The relationship between the support structure and catalytic performance was also investigated by means of different characterization techniques. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The Ln2Ti2O7 (Ln = La, Pr, Sm, and Y) supports were fabricated using the co-precipitation method with La(NO3)3·nH2O, Pr6O11, Sm2(CO3)3, Y(NO3)3·6H2O, and C16H36O4Ti as metal precursors. The Pr(NO3) x and Sm(NO3)3 were prepared by dissolving Pr6O11 and Sm2(CO3)3 in a nitric acid solution (2 mol/L). In the typical preparation of the La2Ti2O7 support, 3.4032 g of C16H36O4Ti was dissolved in a nitric acid solution (2.0 mol/L) to form an aqueous solution. Then, 3.2492 g of La(NO3)3·nH2O was added and stirred thoroughly until a clear solution was obtained. NH3·H2O was added to reach a pH of 9 under stirring for 2 h. After being filtered, the obtained wet solid was dried in an oven at 110 °C for 12 h and finally calcined in a furnace at 800 °C for 4 h, thus obtaining the La2Ti2O7 support. The Pr2Ti2O7, Sm2Ti2O7, and Y2Ti2O7 were prepared using the method same as that for the preparation of the La2Ti2O7 support, except that Y(NO3)3·6H2O, Pr(NO3) x , and Sm(NO3)3 were used as rare earth metal source, respectively. The incipient wetness impregnation method was employed to prepare the Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 catalysts with Ni(NO3)2 as Ni precursor. After Ln2Ti2O7 was impregnated with a desired amount of Ni(NO3)2 aqueous solution under stirring for 24 h, the mixture was dried at 80 °C for 12 h, and calcined in air at 800 °C for 4 h. The loading of Ni was 7 wt%. The final catalysts were denoted as Ni/La2Ti2O7, Ni/Pr2Ti2O7, Ni/Sm2Ti2O7, and Ni/Y2Ti2O7, respectively. 2.2 Catalyst characterization Physicochemical properties of the samples were characterized using the techniques, such as X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), laser Raman, thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC), nitrogen adsorption–desorption (BET), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectroscopy (ICP–OES), H2 temperature-programmed desorption (H2-TPD) or reduction (H2-TPR), and X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS). The detailed characterization procedures are provided in the Supplementary material. 2.3 Catalytic activity evaluation The reaction performance of the samples for the SRM or DRM reaction was evaluated in a fixed-bed quartz tubular microreactor with an internal diameter of 6 mm at 1 atm. In the SRM reaction, the flow rates of H2O and CH4 were 80 and 40 mL/min, respectively, giving a H2O/CH4 volumetric ratio of 2/1 and a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 72,000 mL/(g h). CH4 conversion (C CH4), H2 yield (Y H2), and H2/CO2 ratio (R H2/CO) were calculated by areal normalization. The calculation formulas [30,31] are as follows: C CH4 = (n CH4,in − n CH4,out)/n CH4,in × 100% Y H2 = n H2,out/(4 × n CH4,in) × 100% R H2/CO = n H2,out/n CO,out where the n CH4,in is the molar amount of CH4 in the inlet gas mixture, and n CH4,out, n H2, and n CO are the molar amounts of CH4, H2, and CO in the outlet gas mixture, respectively, which were obtained by quantifying their corresponding GC peaks (integrated peak areas) and using their corresponding response factors. In the DRM reaction, we use a mixed gas (CH4 + CO2 (99.99% in purity)) flow of 15 mL/min with a stoichiometric CH4/CO2 volumetric ratio of 1 : 1 and a WHSV of 3000 mL/(g h). The detailed evaluation procedures can be seen in the Supplementary material In the present work, we use the GC peak areas corresponding to the H2, CO, CH4, and CO2 components and their relative response factors to calculate methane and carbon dioxide conversions in the SRM and DRM reactions. The detailed calculation methods can be seen from the Supplementary material. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Crystal structure and textural property of the Ln2Ti2O7 supports Fig. 1 illustrates the XRD patterns of the Ln2Ti2O7 supports. The diffraction peaks of La2Ti2O7 and Pr2Ti2O7 could readily be indexed to the monoclinic layered perovskite phase, while those of Sm2Y2O7 and Y2Ti2O7 were indexed to the pyrochlore phase. In addition, there were no diffraction signals due to impurities of Ln2O3 or TiO2. The results indicate that the co-precipitation method could generate a pure pyrochlore phase or monoclinic layered perovskite phase in the Ln2Ti2O7 samples. It should be pointed out that only the characteristic diffraction peaks of the pyrochlore or perovskite structure were indicated for the distinguishing of the two types of composite oxides. It is worth noting that in the XRD patterns of the Ln2Ti2O7 supports, the characteristic diffraction peak gradually shifted to the one at a higher 2θ according to the order of La, Pr, Sm, and Y. In the Ln2Ti2O7lattice, the Ti4+(radium = 0.61 Å) at the B site is six-coordinated; and the La3+, Pr3+, Sm3+or Y3+(radium = 1.16, 1.13, 1.08, and 1.02 Å, respectively) at the A site is eight-coordinated. Therefore, the r A/r B ratios of La2Ti2O7, Pr2Ti2O7, Sm2Tir2O7, and Y2Ti2O7 are 1.90, 1.85, 1.77, and 1.67, respectively. Previous studies revealed that the alteration in r A/r B ratio could give rise to a phase change of A2B2O7. In order to form a stable A2B2O7 pyrochlore phase, the r A/r B ratio should be in the range of 1.46–1.78 [21,32–36]. When the r A/r B ratio increased, the initial pyrochlore phase is changed into a monoclinic layered perovskite phase. Therefore, a pyrochlore phase was formed in Sm2Ti2O7 or Y2Ti2O7, but a monoclinic layered perovskite phase was generated in La2Ti2O7 or Pr2Ti2O7. 3.2 Structure of the Ln2Ti2O7 supports Due to the sensitivity to the oxygen–cation vibrations [34,37], Raman spectroscopy was used to elucidate the structural changes of the Ln2Ti2O7supports with different Ln ions at the A site. Usually, there are six active Raman modes of A1g + Eg + 4F2g according to the group theory of the cubic A2B2O7 pyrochlores, which belongs to space group Fd3m [34,38]. As reported previously [20,34,39], the A1g vibration of pyrochlore is mainly due to the flexural vibration of O–B–O, the Eg vibration is a part of the O–B–O bending vibration, part of which comes from the B–O stretching vibration, the three F2g oscillations are mainly related to the BO6 octahedral vibration, and a low-frequency F2g vibration is mainly associated with the O–A–O48f bending vibration. The Raman band at 500 cm−1 could be due to the A1g vibration, the most intense Raman band at 300 cm−1 was attributed to the Eg vibration, and Raman bands at 400, 520, 600, and 750 cm−1 were ascribed to the F2g vibration. According to the literature [40,41], there are thirty-seven Raman bands of La2Ti2O7 because of the phonon modes of various La–O and Ti–O vibrations. The Raman bands at 244 and 342 cm−1 were due to the La–O vibration, the ones at 445 cm−1 (Eg mode), 610 cm−1 (A1g mode), and 793 cm−1 were due to the stretching vibrations of oxygen in octahedral O–Ti–O, the one at 820 cm−1 (B2g mode) was most likely due to the Ti–O stretching vibration of six-fold coordination in rutile TiO2, and the ones at 342, 371, 405, 430, 448, 520, 541, 559, 609, and 793 cm−1 were associated with the monoclinic layered perovskite structure [40]. Based on the above assignments, we can realize that a monoclinic layered perovskite structure was formed in La2Ti2O7 or Pr2Ti2O7, whereas a pyrochlore structure was formed in Sm2Ti2O7 or Y2Ti2O7 (Fig. 2 ). In the Raman spectra of Y2Ti2O7, there were few observable bands (possibly owning to its smaller r A/r B ratio), but the typical Eg and A1g modes of the pyrochlore structure could be clearly observed. This result confirms that there was presence of a pyrochlore phase in Y2Ti2O7. Therefore, the Raman results were in consistency with the XRD results, and changing the A site in the sequence of La, Pr, Sm, and Y (with the decrease in r A/r B ratio) caused the structure of Ln2Ti2O7 to transform from a monoclinic layered perovskite to a pyrochlore. 3.3 Catalytic performance Catalytic activities of the Ni/Ln2Ti2O7samples for the SRM reaction are shown in Fig. 3 . With the rise in reaction temperature, CH4 conversions and H2 yields over Ni/Ln2Ti2O7increased (Fig. 3A and B), a result due to the strong endothermic effect of the SRM reaction. It is obvious that both CH4 conversion and H2 yield over the Ni/Y2Ti2O7 and Ni/Sm2Ti2O7 pyrochlore supports were higher than those over the monoclinic layered perovskites Ni/La2Ti2O7 and Ni/Pr2Ti2O7 throughout the temperatures. Moreover, Ni/Y2Ti2O7showed the highest initial activity among all of the samples. From Fig. 3C, one can see that the H2/CO ratio gradually decreased with a rise in temperature, which might be ascribable to the water-gas shift reaction (CO + H2O → CO2 + H2) [19]. Furthermore, the difference in H2/CO molar ratio over all of the catalysts was gradually leveled off with a rise in temperature, which was due to the exothermic nature of the water-gas shift reaction. In other words, the reaction would be gradually inhibited when the temperature rose. In addition, the effect of weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) on catalytic performance of the Ni/La2Ti2O7 and Ni/Y2Ti2O7 samples was examined, as shown in Fig. S1. It is noticed that with a rise in WHSV from 72,000 to 200,000 mL/(g h), methane conversion over Ni/La2Ti2O7 dropped rapidly from 88 to 47% (41% in drop), whereas that over Ni/Y2Ti2O7 decreased from 91 to 69% (22% in drop). To gain deep understanding of the relationship between Ni dispersion and CH4 conversion, Ni dispersion (Table S1) of the spent samples was also measured using the H2-TPD technique. As compared with Ni dispersion of the fresh Ni/La2Ti2O7 and Ni/Y2Ti2O7 samples, Ni dispersion of the spent counterparts decreased by 20.7 and 9.1%, respectively. Obviously, the drop in methane conversion was in good agreement with the drop in Ni dispersion of the fresh and spent samples. Therefore, Ni dispersion played an important role in governing catalytic activity of the sample. It should be pointed out that Ni dispersion of a sample was associated with the nature of the support. In the case of Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 with different A sites and structures, the interactions between the Ni particles and Ln2Ti2O7 supports were different, resulting in their different catalytic activities. The on-stream SRM reactions over Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 were carried out at 800 °C to probe their durability, as shown in Fig. 4 . Over the monoclinic layered perovskite-supported Ni/La2Ti2O7 and Ni/Pr2Ti2O7 catalysts, obvious drops in CH4 conversion and H2 yield were observed within 50 h of the SRM reaction. This result suggests possible deactivation of the two catalysts. CH4 conversions and H2 yields over the pyrochlore-supported Ni/Y2Ti2O7 and Ni/Sm2Ti2O7 catalysts, however, were relatively stable within 50 h of the SRM reaction. The H2/CO ratio over Ni/Y2Ti2O7 was the most stable (Fig. 4C). In comparison, the H2/CO molar ratio obtained over the Ni/La2Ti2O7 and Ni/Pr2Ti2O7 samples gradually increased with the extension of reaction time, since the enhanced waster-gas shift reaction (CO + H2O → CO2 + H2) gave rise to a decrease in CO concentration and an increase in H2 concentration. Therefore, a higher H2/CO molar ratio could be obtained. As discussed in the XRD and Raman sections, the structure of Ln2Ti2O7 was governed by the r A/r B ratio. A monoclinic layered perovskite structure was formed in La2Ti2O7 or Pr2Ti2O7, whereas a pyrochlore structure was generated in Sm2Ti2O7 or Y2Ti2O7. The disordered degree of oxygen ions in the Ln2Ti2O7 structure increased with the transformation of the crystal phase from monoclinic layered perovskite to cubic pyrochlore (Fig. S2). There was an inherent 8a oxygen vacancy in the pyrochlore unit cell and mobility of the lattice oxygen could be enhanced, resulting in remarkable activity and good stability for methane steam reforming of the Ni/Y2Ti2O7 and Ni/Sm2Ti2O7 samples. In general, the effect of H2O/CH4 molar ratio strongly affects the durability of a catalyst. It is well known that an excessive amount of water is used in practical applications to increase methane conversion. At the same time, the use of a large amount of water can cause the reforming process to consume a large amount of heat. Therefore, the H2O/CH4 molar ratio commonly used in industry is 3 : 1 or 2.5 : 1. We carried out the experiment with a H2O/CH4 molar ratio of 1, and the result is shown in Fig. S3. It can be observed that methane conversion decreased significantly at a lower H2O/CH4 molar ratio. However, the catalyst was relatively stable within 50 h of the SRM reaction, indicating that the Ln2Ti2O7 was suitable as the SRM support. 3.4 Carbon deposition on the spent catalysts Properties of coke formed on the Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 catalysts after 50 h on-stream SRM reaction were measured using the TGA/DSC technique, and their profiles are illustrated in Fig. 5 . There was a slight weight gain on each Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 catalyst in the range of 300–400 °C, which corresponded to the re-oxidation of metallic Ni° to NiO. In addition, the weight loss at high temperatures (> 400 °C) was ascribed to the combustion of carbon deposits. Results of the quantitative coke calculation are summarized in Table 1 . The amount of coke formed on the catalysts decreased in the sequence of Ni/La2Ti2O7 > Ni/Pr2Ti2O7 > Ni/Sm2Ti2O7 > Ni/Y2Ti2O7. It is clearly seen from Table 1 that on the Ni/Y2Ti2O7 catalyst, there were no weight loss and evident thermal signals, indicating that no coking occurred on the Ni/Y2Ti2O7 catalyst after 50-h SRM stability test. To further investigate the properties of coke generated on the Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 catalysts, the DRM stability tests were carried out at 750 °C for 8 h, and their results are shown in Fig. S4. TGA/DSC profiles of the samples after the DRM stability tests are illustrated in Fig. S5. Obviously, a more severe coking phenomenon took place on each of the Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 catalysts in the DRM reaction, as compared with that in the SRM reaction. The weight losses on the pyrochlore-supported Ni/Sm2Ti2O7 and Ni/Y2Ti2O7 catalysts, however, were much less than those on the monoclinic layered perovskite-supported Ni/La2Ti2O7 and Ni/Pr2Ti2O7 catalysts. As stated in the above XRD results, with the decrease in r A/r B ratio, Ln2Ti2O7 transformed from the monoclinic layered perovskite phase (La2Ti2O7 and Pr2Ti2O7) to the cubic pyrochlore phase (Sm2Ti2O7 and Y2Ti2O7), and the oxygen mobility gradually increased due to existence of a less ordered structure in pyrochlore phase [42–44]. Furthermore, the pyrochlore structure supports (Sm2Ti2O7 and Y2Ti2O7) could provide more amounts of oxygen species to eliminate the deposited coke on the Ni surface, as compared with the monoclinic layered perovskite structure supports (La2Ti2O7 and Pr2Ti2O7), hence tiny amounts of coke were detected on the Ni/Sm2Ti2O7 and Ni/Y2Ti2O7 catalysts after the DRM stability tests. Compared with the pyrochlore structure Sm2Ti2O7 support, the Y2Ti2O7 support became less ordered and the oxygen mobility was further enhanced, which made the Ni/Y2Ti2O7 catalyst to exhibit the better potent coke-resistant ability. 3.5 XRD and surface areas of the reduced and spent Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 catalysts Fig. 6 A illustrates XRD patterns of the reduced Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 catalysts. For all of the catalysts, there were no significant changes in diffraction signals of the Ln2Ti2O7 supports; the La2Ti2O7- and Pr2Ti2O7-supported Ni catalysts showed reflections assigned to the monoclinic layered perovskite structure, whereas the Sm2Ti2O7- and Y2Ti2O7-supported Ni catalysts displayed reflections attributed to the cubic pyrochlore structure. Moreover, a metallic Ni° phase was detected, suggesting that the NiO phase formed in the calcined Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 catalysts were fully reduced. The Ni crystallite sizes were calculated according to the Scherrer equation, as listed in Table 2 . It can be realized that the Ni crystallite size increased in the order of Ni/Y2Ti2O7 < Ni/Sm2Ti2O7 < Ni/Pr2Ti2O7 < Ni/La2Ti2O7. Obviously, the Ni crystallite sizes on the pyrochlore supports were smaller than those on the monoclinic layered perovskite supports, indicating presence of different interactions between the Ni species and the Ln2Ti2O7 supports. Fig. 6B shows XRD patterns of the spent Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 catalysts. After 50-h on-stream SRM reaction, there were no significant changes in crystal phase of the Ln2Ti2O7 supports, except that the characteristic diffraction peaks assigned to the Ni(111) facet were sharper than those in the corresponding reduced catalysts, indicating the growth of the Ni particle sizes during the stability test processes. As shown in Table 2, the Ni crystallite sizes on the pyrochlore supports (Ni/Sm2Ti2O7 and Ni/Y2Ti2O7) grew slower than those on the monoclinic layered perovskite support (Ni/La2Ti2O7 and Ni/Pr2Ti2O7). It should be mentioned that the Ni crystallite sizes on the Ni/Y2Ti2O7 catalyst changed only from 15.8 to 18.6 nm. Therefore, the smaller Ni crystallite sizes might be an important factor for the Y2Ti2O7-supported Ni catalyst to possess a high activity and superior coke-resistant ability during the SRM reaction. Table 2 also shows surface areas of the reduced and spent catalysts. We can see that all of the freshly reduced Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 catalysts displayed surface areas of 13–20 m2/g. Apparently, surface area was not a main reason of influencing the activities of the Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 catalysts. To deeply understand the real cause of deactivation in the SRM and DRM reactions, we have eliminated the coke over the spent La2Ti2O7 catalyst and re-used it in the SRM and DRM reactions to monitor the change in catalytic performance, as shown in Fig. S6. For the steam reforming of methane, catalytic activity of the sample did not change significantly after removal of the coke, possibly due to the tiny amounts of the coke. However, the crystallite size of Ni in the Ni/La2Ti2O7 sample increased evidently from 19.2 to 29.1 nm after 50-h SRM stability test, indicating Ni aggregation was one of the main factors leading to decreased activity for the SRM reaction. In comparison, catalytic activity of the sample for the DRM reaction increased significantly after removal of the coke, because a more severe coking phenomenon took place in the DRM reaction than in the SRM reaction over the Ni/La2Ti2O7 sample. 3.6 Ni dispersion on the reduced catalysts To probe the metallic Ni° distributions and Ni particle sizes of the Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 catalysts, the freshly reduced catalysts were measured by means of the TEM technique, and their results are shown in Fig. 7 . The metallic Ni° grains were observed in all of the Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 catalysts, as indicated in the red cycles. For the Ni/La2Ti2O7 and Ni/Pr2Ti2O7 catalysts, the Ni distributions were not uniform and some Ni° nanoparticles were aggregated, leading to an increase in particle size. The Ni° grains on the Ni/Sm2Ti2O7 and Ni/Y2Ti2O7 catalysts, however, were evenly distributed with the average particle sizes being 17.5 and 16.6 nm, respectively, which were consistent with the XRD results. The TEM images also proved that there was a more uniform Ni° distribution on the pyrochlore supports than on the monoclinic layered perovskite supports. As a consequence, the Ni/Sm2Ti2O7 and Ni/Y2Ti2O7 samples showed better SRM performance than the Ni/La2Ti2O7 and Ni/Pr2Ti2O7 samples. Metallic Ni° dispersion of the reduced Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 samples was determined using the H2-TPD technique, as summarized in Table 3 . Apparently, Metallic Ni° surface areas and metallic Ni° dispersion of the Sm2Ti2O7 and Y2Ti2O7 samples were higher than those of the La2Ti2O7 and Pr2Ti2O7 samples, respectively. This result indicates that there was a stronger interaction of the active Ni species with the cubic pyrochlore supports, hence suppressing the growth of Ni nanoparticles at high temperatures. H2-TPD results were consistent with the results of XRD and TEM investigations. 3.7 Redox properties of the Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 catalysts H2-TPR was employed to study reducibility of the Ln2Ti2O7 and Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 samples, and their profiles and quantitative results are shown in Fig. 8 and Table 4 , respectively. All of the Ln2Ti2O7 supports showed no reduction peaks blow 700 °C. The Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 samples displayed two main reduction peaks, corresponding to reduction of the Ni species in different coordination environments [19,45]. Generally speaking, the peak at the lower temperature (below 400 °C) was assigned to reduction of the bulk NiO crystallites, while the peak at the higher temperature (above 500 °C) was attributed to reduction of the NiO species that had a stronger interaction with the support. Obviously, with the change of the A-site element from La to Pr, Sm or Y, the reduction peak was shifted to a higher temperature, indicating that the active Ni species had a stronger interaction with the pyrochlore supports (Sm2Ti2O7 and Y2Ti2O7) than with the monoclinic layered perovskite supports (La2Ti2O7 and Pr2Ti2O7). Additionally, quantitative calculation of H2-TPR profiles reveals that the H/Ni ratio was close to 2.00, which means that the Ni species on the Ln2Ti2O7 supports were mainly Ni2+. 3.8 Surface properties of the Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 catalysts Surface oxygen species on the reduced Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 catalysts were investigated by the XPS technique, and their O 1s XPS spectra are illustrated in Fig. 9 . It has been reported that the amounts of oxygen vacancies could be roughly estimated from the adsorbed oxygen species amounts in the XPS spectra of the samples [19]. The signals at BE = 529.0 and 531.0 eV were assigned to the surface lattice oxygen (Olatt) and adsorbed oxygen (Oads) species [46], respectively. Quantitative analysis results of the Oads and Oads + Olatt amounts as well as the Oads/(Oads + Olatt) ratios are summarized in Table 5 . The Oads/(Oads + Olatt) ratios on Ni/Sm2Ti2O7 (21%) and Ni/Y2Ti2O7 (29%) were much higher than those on Ni/La2Ti2O7 (14%) and Ni/Pr2Ti2O7 (19%). In the cubic pyrochlore structure, there are two types of oxygen species, namely six 48f oxygen ions in octahedral BO6 and one 8b oxygen ions in tetrahedral A4O’ (Fig. S2). Furthermore, it is well known that the phase composition of the pyrochlore-type A2B2O7 relies on the r A/r B ratio. The oxygen mobility of the cubic A2B2O7 could be enhanced due to the increased disorder in the crystalline structure. XRD and Raman results demonstrate that with the rise in r A/r B ratio, La2Ti2O7 changed from the less ordered pyrochlore to the monoclinic layered perovskite phase, thus leading to a decrease in amount of the oxygen vacancies that played an important role in eliminating deposited carbon [47,48]. The higher Oads/(Oads + Olatt) ratio allowed the Ni/Y2Ti2O7 sample to exhibit a higher catalytic activity and a better coke-resistant ability. 4 Conclusions The Ln2Ti2O7 (Ln = La, Pr, Sm, and Y) supports were fabricated via the co-precipitation route, which were used as supports to prepare supported Ni catalysts for hydrogen production from the SRM reaction. With the change of the A-site element from La and Pr to Sm and Y, the Ln2Ti2O7 supports transformed from the monoclinic layered perovskite structure to the monoclinic layered pyrochlore structure. H2-TPR results show that the active Ni species had a stronger interaction with the Sm2Ti2O7 or Y2Ti2O7 pyrochlore support than with the monoclinic layered perovskite structure La2Ti2O7 or Pr2Ti2O7 support. The Ni active sites were highly dispersed on the pyrochlore supports, thus exhibiting the better catalytic activity for the SRM reaction. In addition, the pyrochlore supports could provide more amounts of oxygen vacancies, which were beneficial for the removal of carbonaceous deposits on the surface of the catalyst, hence improving their stability. Among all of the catalysts, the Ni/Y2Ti2O7 catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity and the best coke-resistant ability.

        "dc:description": "Ln2Ti2O7 (Ln = La, Pr, Sm, and Y) and Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 catalysts were prepared using the co-precipitation and incipient wetness impregnation methods, respectively. XRD and Raman results reveal that with the decrease in r A/r B ratio of A2B2O7 (A = La, Pr, Sm, and Y; B = Ti), the crystal structure transformed from the monoclinic layered perovskite (La2Ti2O7 and Pr2Ti2O7) to the ordered pyrochlore (Sm2Ti2O7 and Y2Ti2O7). H2-TPR results demonstrate that the active Ni species had a stronger interaction with Sm2Ti2O7 or Y2Ti2O7 than with La2Ti2O7 or Pr2Ti2O7. Therefore, smaller Ni crystallites with larger active metallic surface areas could be formed in the Ni/Sm2Ti2O7 and Ni/Y2Ti2O7 catalysts. XPS results indicate that the oxygen vacancies and oxygen mobility were also gradually enhanced with the decrease in r A/r B ratio. As a consequence, the Ni/Y2Ti2O7 sample exhibited the highest catalytic activity and the best coke-resistant ability in the steam reforming of methane for hydrogen production among all of the catalysts. It is concluded that the change in A-site element influenced the structures of Ln2Ti2O7 significantly, which ultimately affected catalytic performance of Ni/Ln2Ti2O7 for the steam reforming of methane.",
