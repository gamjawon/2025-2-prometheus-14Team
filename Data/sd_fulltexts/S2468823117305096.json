Further, other IBILs with different anions were chosen to fabricate Ru-based catalysts, and the catalysts showed high activity and selectivity similar with Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC catalyst. It is demonstrated that IBILs additives can significantly improve the dispersion of ruthenium species and prevent the appearance of coke deposition owing to the interactions between Ru species and [BMIM]BF4. Moreover, the oxygen-containing functional groups on the carbon support are associated with the interactions among Ru species and [BMIM]BF4. Keywords Acetylene Hydrochlorination Ru-based Catalyst Coke Deposition Imidazolium-based Ionic Liquids 1 Introduction Vinyl chloride, the important monomer to produce the popular plastic polyvinyl chloride (PVC), is industrially produced via the acetylene hydrochlorination reaction with the mercury chloride (HgCl2) catalyst in coal-based economic countries [1,2]. The active component HgCl2 is easily volatile at the reaction condition, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst [3,4] but also the severe hazards to the environment ecology and the human health. In October 2013, approximately 140 countries signed the Minamata Convention in Japan aiming at forbidding the application of mercury worldwide in near future [5,6]. Consequently, it is crucial to explore an efficient and non-mercury catalyst for the hydrochlorination of acetylene. Au-based catalysts have been intensively studied as the non-mercury catalyst for acetylene hydrochlorination [7,8], in particular, bimetallic Au-based catalysts including the additive of the secondary metal of Cu [9,10], La [11], Ba [12], Cs [13], Bi [14], or Sn [15], etc., and the trimetallic Au-Co-Cu catalyst have showed much better catalytic activities [3]. However, in the view of industrial production, the promising non-mercury catalyst should possess the feature of high activity, long-term stability as well as low cost. Ruthenium-based catalysts have recently attracted more attentions for acetylene hydrochlorination owing to the comparable catalytic activity but much lower cost of ruthenium, comparing with that of gold [16–23]. For instance, bimetallic catalyst 1%Ru1Co(III)3/SAC showed an C2H2 conversion of 95% at 170°C and the C2H2 GHSV of 360h−1 [16]. Trimetallic catalyst Ru1Co(III)3Cu(II)1/SAC showed an C2H2 conversion of 99.0% for at least 500h at 170°C and the C2H2 GHSV of 90h−1 [23]. However, Ru-based catalysts face up with the challenge of coke deposition during long time reaction. For the catalyst Ru1Co(III)3Cu(II)1/SAC experienced 48h reaction, the coke deposition amount is of 2.4%, while 1%Ru1Co(III)3/SAC catalyst after 24h reaction possessed the coke deposition of 3.25%. Thus, it is fundamental to explore effective method to inhibit the coke deposition so as to enhance the stability of Ru-based catalysts. In recent years, more attentions have been gravitated towards room temperature Ionic Liquids (ILs) attributed to the advantage of high thermal stability, superior solubility for a wide variety of organic, inorganic, and polymeric molecules [24]. With the aid of the Supported Ionic Liquid Phase (SILP) technique, ILs can form a thin film on the catalyst surfaces providing the homogeneous solvent environment, facilitating the mass transport, thus stabilizing the transition metal catalyst. For instance, the common Imidazolium-based Ionic Liquids (IBIL) with the melting temperatures below 100°C have been applied in many reactions, such as hydrogenation [25], hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene [26], hydroformylation [27–29], hydroamination [30], hydroaminomethylation [31], and propylene epoxidation [24]. In 2012, He et al. studied the solubility of hydrogen chloride in three kinds of ILs, demonstrating that [BMIM]Cl has the outstanding dissolution towards HCl [32]. Zhao et al. investigated the solubility of acetylene in room-temperature ILs through the theoretical calculation, indicating that room-temperature ILs of [bmim][OAc] and [bmim][BF4] have the superior solubility toward C2H2 [33]. Zhao et al. prepared the Au(III)–IL/AC catalyst using the Ionic Liquid (1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride) and the precursor of HAuCl4·4H2O, which provided the C2H2 conversion of 77.1% under the conditions of 180°C and the C2H2 GHSV of 370h−1 [34]. These interesting results enlightened us to study whether or not Ru-based catalysts can be improved by suitable ILs for acetylene hydrochlorination. In this article, we adopted Imidazolium-based Ionic Liquids (IBILs) to modify Ru-based catalysts using the Supported Ionic Liquid Phase (SILP) technique, and assessed the catalytic performance for C2H2 hydrochlorination. Characterized by TEM, TPD, N2 adsorption-desorption, TGA and XPS, etc., the optimal IBIL was selected and the effect of IBIL additives on the catalytic activity of Ru-based catalysts were studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of catalysts 2.1.1 Chemicals Coconut activated carbon (AC, 24–35mesh) was used as the support purchased from Fujian Sensen Carbon Industry Science and Technology Company with limited liability. In addition, the commercial carbon was used directly without further purification. RuCl3·3H2O (Ru content≥38%, purity≥99%) was purchased from Tianjin Fengchuan Reagent Co. Ltd. and used as the precursor. 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM]BF4, purity≥97%) and 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIM]PF6, purity≥97%) were purchased from Shanghai Shaoyuan Chemical Technology Co. Ltd. 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]Cl, purity≥99%) were purchased from Shanghai Demo medical Technology Co. Ltd. In this study, all chemicals were used without pre-treatment. 2.1.2 Pristine Ru/AC catalyst RuCl3·3H2O was used as the precursor to prepare Ru-based catalysts by the incipient wetness impregnation method [19,22]. Activated carbon were added to the solution of RuCl3·3H2O in tri-distilled water at room temperature under stirring with the Ru loading of 1wt%, followed by ultrasonic treatment for 10min ensuring that the precursor was uniformly adsorbed on the surface of activated carbon. Next, the overall mixture was incubated at 60°C keeping 12h and was then desiccated at 150°C keeping 12h in the vacuum drying oven. The obtained catalyst was named as Ru/AC. 2.1.3 Ru-IBILs catalysts Ruthenium [BMIM]BF4 catalysts were prepared by adding the RuCl3·3H2O quantitatively into [BMIM]BF4 as a precursor, then the mixture was dissolved in tri-distilled water under stirring, followed by ultrasonic treatment for 10min. Supported Ru-[BMIM]BF4 catalysts were synthesized by adding the AC to the Ru-[BMIM]BF4 solution in certain ratio with fast stirring under room temperature, and then aging at 60°C for 12h. After, the products were dried at 150°C in the vacuum drying oven for 12h and denoted as Ru1%[BMIM]BF4/AC, Ru5%[BMIM]BF4/AC, Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC and Ru15%[BMIM]BF4/AC with the Ru loading of 1wt% and the various mass contents of [BMIM]BF4 from 1wt% to 15wt%. Moreover, Ru-[BMIM]PF6/AC and Ru-[BMIM]Cl/AC catalysts were prepared by the same procedure with the Ru loading of 1wt% and the IBILs loading of 10wt%. 2.2 Catalytic property tests These catalysts were evaluated in a fixed bed stainless steel microreactor (internal diameter of 10mm, the length of 50cm). The temperature was controlled by a CKW1100 temperature controller purchased from Beijing Chao Yang Automation Instruments Factory. The clean C2H2 was first purged using silica-gel desiccant, and HCl gas was passed through molecular sieves to remove the trace water. Firstly, the whole system was purged by introducing N2 continuously to remove air and water. Before reaction, the high-purity HCl gas (16.5mLmin−1) was fed through the microreactor for 30min at 170°C. Then, C2H2 (15.0mLmin−1) was introduced into the microreactor starting reaction at the condition of 170°C and the C2H2 GHSV of 180h−1. The effluent stream was first passed into NaOH aqueous solution to remove the superfluous HCl gas, and then analyzed by Bei Fen 3420A gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (FID). 2.3 Catalyst characterization TEM was performed on an FEI Titan 80300 TEM/STEM (FEI, USA) at the acceleration voltage of 200kV. The catalyst powder was first dispersed in absolute ethyl alcohol and then centrifuged to get the supernatant. BET pore structure and specific surface areas were measured using the Quantachrome Instruments autosorb analyzer (Quantanchrome, USA). The samples were degassed at 220°C for 4h, then analyzed using liquid nitrogen adsorption and desorption at 77K. TGA was carried out on TG-DTG simultaneous thermal analyzer (NETZSCH STA 449F3 Jupiter®, Germany) under air atmosphere with a flow rate of 20mLmin−1 or nitrogen atmosphere with a flow rate of 50mLmin−1 with a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 from 35°C to 900°C. TPD was conducted by an AutoChem BET TPR/TPD (Quantachrome, USA) to investigate the adsorption and desorption property of catalysts for reactants and products. Firstly, 120mg catalysts adsorbed C2H2 or HCl at 170°C for 4h in the microreactor individually. Then, the catalysts were transferred to TPD instrument and treated with pure He for 30min, followed by desorbing in a rate of 10°Cmin−1 from 50 to 700°C. For the C2H3Cl-TPD, 120mg catalysts were pre-treated with C2H3Cl for an hour at 170°C on the TPD instrument, and then tested at the same conditions with reactants-TPD. CO-TPD was measured by this instrument, with the samples reduced at 400°C for an hour in the atmosphere of H2/Ar. The CO uptake profile was detected by a TCD detector, and the calculation of the ruthenium dispersion assumed the adsorption ratio for CO: Ru equaling 1:1. X-ray photoelectron spectra were performed with a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) using a monochromatic AlKα X-ray source. The binding energies were calibrated with the C1s level of carbon at 284.8eV. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Performance of Ru-[BMIM]BF4/AC catalysts Fig. 1 presents the performance of the supported Ru-[BMIM]BF4 catalysts for the acetylene hydrochlorination reaction, together with that of the support AC and the IL-supported 10%[BMIM]BF4/AC without Ru. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the AC support displays the initial C2H2 conversion of 24.9% and decreases to 14.6% in 24h, while the 10%[BMIM]BF4/AC shows lower activity than AC. The pristine Ru/AC catalyst exhibits an initial C2H2 conversion of 81.4% and reduces by 13.6% at 24h with the steady selectivity to VCM of 99.5%. After adding the [BMIM]BF4, the Ru-based catalysts display a significant increase of C2H2 conversion and the catalytic activity is affected by the dosage of Ionic Liquid. As the loading of [BMIM]BF4 from 1% to 10%, the C2H2 conversion achieves the highest initial value of 98.9% and has no obvious decrease at 24h (98.2%) over the Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC catalyst. When the loading of [BMIM]BF4 further increases to 15%, the conversion of C2H2 becomes a little bit lower than that of Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC catalyst at the same conditions. Therefore, the optimal loading of [BMIM]BF4 is selected as 10% for further investigation. Compared with the former Ru-based catalysts reported in the literatures, Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC catalyst exhibits superior catalytic performance, as shown in Table S1. As different catalysts for acetylene hydrochlorination are evaluated in various conditions reported in the literature, the direct comparison of C2H2 conversion has little meaning, so we calculate the turnover frequency (TOF) in order to present the catalytic properties of Ru-based catalysts synthetically. In this study, TOF is defined as the rate of C2H2 conversion per number of Ru active sites per minute (seeing detail information in Table S2). In order to eliminate the mass or heat transfer effects, the acetylene hydrochlorination reaction is performed at low C2H2 conversion (<15%) over the Ru-based catalysts [35]. Fig. 2 displays the turnover frequency (TOF) values of these different Ru-based catalysts. The TOF value of Ru/AC is 8.9min−1. As the [BMIM]BF4 loading rises from 1% to 10%, the TOF value increases obviously to 24min−1, followed by a decrease to 20min−1 over Ru15%[BMIM]BF4/AC. It is indicated that the addition of [BMIM]BF4 can greatly improve the catalytic activity of Ru-based catalysts. Previously, some researchers have reported the TOF values of Ru-based catalysts, such as TOF (Ru/SAC-C300) of 12.98min−1 [17], TOF (Ru-K/SAC) of 2.45min−1 [19]. Obviously, Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC catalyst achieves the highest TOF value compared with other Ru-based catalysts in literatures. To disclose the reason that the [BMIM]BF4 additive can improve the activity of Ru-based catalyst, the following characterizations were carried out for the Ru-[BMIM]BF4/AC catalysts. 3.2 Characteristics 3.2.1 TEM TEM images of fresh and used Ru/AC and Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC catalysts are depicted in Fig. 3 . Tiny black dots can be clearly observed in the TEM images, corresponding to Ru species on AC. It can be calculated from the particle size distribution, the average particle size of fresh Ru/AC catalyst is 1.4nm, while it is 1.1nm for fresh Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC catalyst. In other words, this demonstrates that the addition of Ionic Liquid promotes the dispersion of Ru species. After experiencing 24h of reaction, the black spots are obviously larger than fresh catalysts, and the average particle size of used Ru/AC catalyst rises to 1.7nm. This result indicates that the Ru species gathered to grow up during the reaction, resulting in the deactivation of Ru/AC catalyst in the process of reaction. The average particle size of used Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC catalyst is 1.2nm and the gathering degree of Ru species far less than the used Ru/AC catalyst (7.1% vs. 19.4%). It reflects that IBILs can inhibit the aggregation of Ru species in the reaction process, thereby improving the activity, consistent with the result of catalysts test. 3.2.2 CO uptake Table 1 lists the dispersion of Ru species on these catalysts calculated by the CO uptake. The Ru dispersion of fresh Ru/AC is 22.4%. It is obvious that the Ru dispersion of Ru-[BMIM]BF4 catalysts is higher than that of pristine Ru catalyst, and the highest dispersion is 33.2% for the catalyst Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC, followed by Ru15%[BMIM]BF4/AC (30.2%), Ru5%[BMIM]BF4/AC (26.8%) and Ru1%[BMIM]BF4/AC (24.2%). This result suggests that the Ru-based catalysts display a conspicuous increase of dispersion after adding the [BMIM]BF4, coincided with the TEM result. As the Ionic Liquids are excellent solvents for both organic and inorganic compounds, probably, this advantage makes Ru well disperse on the surface of AC in the surroundings of the [BMIM]BF4. 3.2.3 BET results N2 adsorption/desorption experiments have been taken to obtain the specific surface area and the pore volume of theses catalysts. From Table 2 , the specific surface area of AC is 1303.0m2 g−1 and Ru/AC of 1288.9m2 g−1 for the fresh catalysts. After the deposition of Ru-[BMIM]BF4, the specific surface area decreases gradually in the order of Ru1%[BMIM]BF4/AC (1116.3m2 g−1)>Ru5%[BMIM]BF4/AC (1044.0m2 g−1)>Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC (873.3m2 g−1)>Ru15%[BMIM]BF4/AC (780.9m2 g−1), and the total pore volume decreases as a similar trend. It confirms that [BMIM]BF4 has entered into the internal hole-channel of AC. As for the used catalysts, after 24h reaction, the surface area and the pore volume are reduced comparing with fresh catalysts. The surface area and the pore volume of Ru/AC decrease 271.3m2 g−1 and 0.09cm3 g−1, respectively. Relatively, other catalysts presents lower decrease after reaction, and the Ru15%[BMIM]BF4/AC catalyst exhibits the lowest decrease in surface area (118.2m2 g−1) and pore volume (0.06cm3 g−1) after the reaction. The variation is most likely because of the appearance of coke deposition causing some micro pores block on the AC surface after 24h reaction [36,37]. 3.2.4 TGA TGA is an important method to reveal the degree of coke deposition on the surface of catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S2, a slight mass loss appears before 100°C for the fresh and used catalysts, as a result of volatilization of absorbed water [17,38]. In the range of 100–365°C, burning of coke deposition and carbon-containing groups contributes to an observable weight loss, reflecting the quantity of coke deposition. When the temperature is over 365°C, a rapid weight decrease appeases owing to the combustion of the support. As Table 3 shows, the weight loss of fresh Ru/AC is 3.7% in the range of 100–365°C, while it is 11.7% for the used Ru/AC. Thus, the quantity of coke deposition is approximately 8.3% for the Ru/AC in this reaction, on the basis that the quantity of coke deposition is estimated on the basis of the mass loss difference between fresh and spent catalysts in the temperature range of 100–365°C [39]. As for the quantity of coke deposition for different catalysts, the quantity of coke deposition decreases gradually with the loading of IL from 1% to 15%: Ru/AC (8.3%)>Ru1%[BMIM]BF4/AC (8.0%)>Ru5%[BMIM]BF4/AC (3.4%)>Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC (1.5%)>Ru15%[BMIM]BF4/AC (0.5%). The tendency is similar with BET results as coke deposition causes the surface area loss and the pore volume loss. This result suggests that the [BMIM]BF4 additive can efficiently inhibit the form of coke deposition, thus the catalytic ability enhanced notably. 3.2.5 TPD TPD experiments have been conducted to explore the adsorption and desorption property of Ru-based catalysts. The C2H2, HCl and C2H3Cl TPD profiles of fresh Ru/AC and Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC catalysts are shown in Fig. 5 . Additively, He-TPD for fresh Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC catalyst was operated to eliminate the influence of [BMIM]BF4 decomposition. In He atmosphere, the peak in the temperature range from 250°C to 550°C represents the decomposition of [BMIM]BF4, coincident with TGA result in Fig. S1(a). As a consequence, the peak should be excluded when analyzing C2H2-TPD, HCl-TPD and C2H3Cl-TPD peak of fresh Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC catalyst. Generally, desorption temperature represents adsorption strength and the peak area reflects adsorption capacity. From Fig. 4(a), the HCl desorption peak area of Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC is much larger than Ru/AC, and the corresponding desorption temperature on Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC is obviously higher than that on Ru/AC, indicating that the adsorption property of HCl on Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC is stronger. For another reactant, the Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC catalyst presents slightly lower adsorption capacity than Ru/AC catalyst. Chao et al. have proved that the adsorption capacity for C2H2 has a negative effect on the catalyst stability [40]. As for the product C2H3Cl, the result is opposite with the reactant of HCl. From Fig. 4(c), the peak presenting in the range from 250°C to 500°C due to the decomposition of [BMIM]BF4, the desorption temperature is around 133°C for C2H3Cl on Ru/AC, while it is about 116°C on Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC, significantly lower than Ru/AC. In addition, the peak area for Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC is obviously lower than that of Ru/AC, suggesting that the products can diffuse out of the catalyst channels in time, thus, carbon deposition is difficult to form, consistent with TG results. It is indicated that the usage of [BMIM]BF4 for Ru-based catalyst can strengthen the adsorption for HCl and the desorption for VCM, hence the coke deposition is inhibited during the reaction. 3.2.6 XPS XPS spectra were measured for the fresh and used Ru-based catalysts together with fresh 10%[BMIM]BF4/AC, in order to disclose the valence state of Ru species in the absence and presence of [BMIM]BF4. As listed in Table 4 , without Ru loading the 10%[BMIM]BF4/AC catalyst consists of 86.8% carbon, 2.5% nitrogen, 6.8% oxygen, 2.9% fluorine and 1.0% boron. While in the absence of [BMIM]BF4, the Ru/AC there appears 0.6% ruthenium and 0.9% chlorine besides the elements of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. In the case of Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC, the contents of ruthenium and fluorine are close respectively to those in Ru/AC and 10%[BMIM]BF4/AC. Considering the molecular structure of [BMIM]BF4 (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary material), the oxygen elements are due to the functional groups including CO, −OH, COC and −COOH on the surface of carbon support [41,42], which is displayed in the deconvoluted O1s XPS spectra (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary material). Comparing the fresh 10%[BMIM]BF4/AC with Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC, it is worthy to note the obvious shift of binding energies of oxygen species, suggesting that the oxygen-containing functional groups on the carbon support are associated with the interactions among Ru species and [BMIM]BF4. Fig. 6 compares the deconvoluted F1s XPS spectra for the fresh 10%[BMIM]BF4/AC and Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC. For 10%[BMIM]BF4/AC, the major peak located at 685.9eV corresponds to the BF3 from [BMIM]BF4, and the minor peak at 687.4eV reflects the fluorine atom spontaneously interacting with the cationic [BMIM]+ and boron, with the area ratio of 0.26 for A687.4/A685.9. In the case of Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC, there are also two peaks in F1s XPS spectra, however, the peak at 687.2eV become much stronger, with the A687.4/A685.9 area ratio of 1.13. It is suggested that there is significant interaction between fluorine and Ru species in the Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC. To analyze the ruthenium species, Ru 3p peaks are deconvoluted since the Ru 3d peak overlaps with that of C1s line at 284.8eV. Previous literatures indicated five kinds of Ru species in Ru-based catalysts, involving metallic Ru (Ru0, 461.4±0.4eV), Rua with the Ru valence between +1 and +3 (462.3±0.3eV), Ru3+ (463.0±0.3eV), Ru4+ (464.5±0.4eV) and Rub with the Ru valence higher than +4 (465.7–467.2eV) [16,17,23]. As listed in Table 5 and shown in Fig. S5, for the fresh Ru/AC there are four kinds of ruthenium species located respectively at 462.3eV due to Rua(1≤a<3), 463.5eV for Ru3+, 464.8eV for Ru4+ and 464.8eV for Rub(b>4), with the dominant species of Ru4+(31.3%), of which the relative amount of each species follows the order of Ru4+(31.3%)>Rub(30.2%)>Ru3+(25.8%)>Rua(12.9%). While for the fresh Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC there are also four similar ruthenium species with somewhat shift of binding energy, however, the relative amount of each species changes to another order: Rua(34.4%)>Ru4+(29.3%)>Rub(18.9%)>Ru3+(17.4%). It is illustrated that in the presence of [BMIM]BF4 the valence distribution of Ru species changes significantly. On the other hand, for the used catalysts there appears Ru0 species at 461.0eV in XPS spectra, with the relative amount of 20.2% for the used Ru/AC versus 9.7% for the used Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC. It is reported that the more metallic Ru exists in the catalyst, the lower catalytic activity [17]. Therefore, the presence of [BMIM]BF4 can greatly inhibit the formation of Ru0 species so as to retard the deactivation of Ru-based catalysts. Additionally, in combination with the binding energy shift of O1s XPS spectra, it is confirmed that the interactions indeed occur among [BMIM]BF4, Ru species and the oxygen-containing function groups on the surfaces of carbon supports, which results in the superior performance of Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC. 3.3 Performance of Ru-IBILs/AC catalysts To prove that the IBILs can indeed improve the activity of Ru-based catalysts, two other IBILs have been applied to make further investigation in acetylene hydrochlorination reaction at the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 7 , the C2H2 conversion of Ru10%[BMIM]PF6/AC achieves 97.5% with the selectivity to VCM of 99.8%, and the Ru10%[BMIM]Cl/AC displays the acetylene conversion of 98.6% with the selectivity to VCM of 99.9% after 24h. The conversion of C2H2 and selectivity to VCM for those three Ru-IBILs catalysts presents a similar trend with the passage of time. Therefore, the SILP technique may advance the development of acetylene hydrochlorination reaction. 4 Conclusion Ru-IBILs catalysts have been synthesized with different IBILs and assessed for acetylene hydrochlorination reaction. The Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC catalyst presents an outstanding performance with the C2H2 conversion of 98.2% and 99.8% selectivity to VCM after 24h under the conditions of: 170°C, GHSV(C2H2)=180h−1, and V(HCl):V(C2H2)=1.1. We have proved that [BMIM]BF4 additive can efficiently inhibit the coke deposition from TGA results. In addition, [BMIM]BF4 makes Ru more stable than IBIL-free Ru/AC catalyst, owing to the superior dispersity of Ru species and the strong interaction among Ru species and [BMIM]BF4. We have successfully introduced the SILP technique for Ru-based catalysts catalytic the acetylene hydrochlorination reaction. Furthermore, the Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC catalyst performed the highest TOF value of 24min−1 compared with the reported TOF values of Ru-based catalysts for acetylene hydrochlorination in the literatures.

        "dc:description": "Imidazolium-based Ionic Liquids (IBILs) were employed to synthesize Ru-based catalysts using the Supported Ionic Liquid Phase (SILP) technique for acetylene (C2H2) hydrochlorination, combining the characterizations of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption-desorption (BET), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), etc. The optimal Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC catalyst achieved the C2H2 conversion of 98.9% and the selectivity to vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) of 99.8% under the temperature of 170°C and the C2H2 gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 180h−1. Further, other IBILs with different anions were chosen to fabricate Ru-based catalysts, and the catalysts showed high activity and selectivity similar with Ru10%[BMIM]BF4/AC catalyst. It is demonstrated that IBILs additives can significantly improve the dispersion of ruthenium species and prevent the appearance of coke deposition owing to the interactions between Ru species and [BMIM]BF4. Moreover, the oxygen-containing functional groups on the carbon support are associated with the interactions among Ru species and [BMIM]BF4.",
