Mercuric chloride catalysts are used to catalyze acetylene hydration for acetaldehyde production with high activity, but high toxicity limits its practical application. Here we present a phosphorus and sulfur ligands-complexed copper catalyst assessed for acetylene hydration. The optimum catalyst gave more than 94.0% acetylene conversion and 88.4% aldehyde selectivity at 10 h. After running for 20 h, the catalyst showed high stability. The conversion to acetylene remained stable at over 93.3% and the selectivity of aldehyde decreased from 92.2% to 79.7%. The accession of phosphorus and sulfur could be highly vigorous for the acetylene hydration reaction. All the catalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS, ICP, TPR, TEM, FT-IR and BET technologies. The results indicate that the selectivity of the catalysts is mainly improved by the P fragment of the ligands, and the S fragment of the ligands could restrain the loss of copper species to improve the stability of the catalysts. Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract Keywords Acetylene hydration P-, S-containing ligands Cu-based catalyst Complexing effect Introduction The ethyl acetate, chloral, butylene aldehyde, pyridine, and so on, manufactured with acetaldehyde, are significant chemical intermediates used to produce a variety of materials [1,2]. There are many methods for the synthesis of acetaldehyde, the hydration of acetylene to produce acetaldehyde is preferable, as the coal resources are comparatively rich in China [3]. To date, Hg-based catalysts were most widely applied in acetylene hydration. But mercury has serious volatility and toxicity, and it may pose serious harm to both workers and the environment [4,5]. Therefore, it is quite imperative to find efficient non-mercury catalysts as alternatives for mercuric catalysts to promote sustainable development for acetaldehyde production. In the past few decades, the green catalytic transformation of acetylene hydration has been actively developing. Many metal ions were used as the active ingredients of the catalysts (such as Cu, Ag, and Zn) [6]. In a report by Beyer, simple zeolites, including Zn species, were prepared to generate acetaldehyde from acetylene. However, the main problem was still the poor stability of these catalysts [7]. Recently, Wang et al. [8] reported that a Zn-Cu bimetallic catalyst had improved the catalytic activity to 96%. Although the catalytic activity was improved by the interaction of Zn and Cu, there is an especially important problem that the catalytic stability should be improved. To promote the activity and stability of Zn-based catalysts, Wang and other researchers turn their attention to modifying the carrier. In their work, the Ti-doped MCM-41 supporting Zn-based catalysts had a higher catalytic performance than their previous studies [9]. For further exploration, Wang et al. [10] investigated the interaction between Zn and MCM-41. They pretreated Zn species by plasma pretreatment technology in different gases and process conditions to enhance the interaction between the Zn species and MCM-41. It has achieved quite high conversion and selectivity. However, the Zn-based catalysts needed a quite high Zn loading. Therefore, a catalyst with low loading and high catalytic performance should be explored. At present, Cu-based catalysts are definitely a research hotspot for various catalytic reactions, so researchers have been finding ways to improve Cu-based catalytic activity and stability. It has been proved that the Cu-based catalyst with phosphine-oxide organic ligand would significantly improve the activity and stability of acetylene hydrochlorination [11]. In addition, Ren et al. [12] reported a Cu-based catalyst with a series of chlorocuprate(I) ILs for acetylene hydrochlorination, which has shown excellent catalytic performance. The results proved that chlorocuprate(I) ILs could stable the major active Cu(I) species and the obtained complexing catalyst has the capacity to effectively activate HCl. All these methods of acetylene hydrochlorination provide the feasibility of Cu-based catalysts to improve the catalytic performance for acetylene hydration. Furthermore, Zhang et al. [13] chose ionic liquids containing P to form a coordination structure with Cu(II) and found that the ionic liquid containing P has an inhibitory effect on the reduction of divalent copper and can promote the distribution of active species. In addition, Ding et al. [14] also reported a similar result. On the basis of these studies, we believe that the Cu-based catalyst for acetylene hydration still has great potential. According to the present research, the main reason for the deactivation of catalysts is the loss and reduction of Cu specie, which would lead to the severe deactivation of catalysts [12,15]. In order to restrain the loss and reduction of Cu species, many researchers use ligand coordination to design and adjust the active component valence state to prevent catalyst deactivation [16–19]. For instance, Cu-ligand cooperation decreases the electronic density of copper for stabilizing the active component to improve the catalytic activity. There have been a few reports on acetylene hydration over Cu-based catalysts both in the gas-liquid and gas-solid catalytic reactions. In recent reports, Yang et al. [20] demonstrated that the addition of S ligands has an ability to improve the coordination ability of the cooper for the acetylene hydration reaction system. Zhang et al. [21] exploited a Cu-based catalyst with HEDP (1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid) for acetylene hydration. They found that the improvement of activity might be ascribed to the synergy between Cu and HEDP, and the existences of Cu+ and Cu2+ were considered active ingredients. This method provides feasibility to improve the performance of Cu-based catalysts and the stability is still room to be improved in the long run. In view of the above basic research, we presumed that the addition of P and S atoms could influence the activity and stability of the activated carbon (AC)-supported Cu catalysts. In recent years, DESMP as a cheap ligand has attracted wide concern for its unique chemical properties and potential value [22], which contains one single phosphine fragment and one sulfonic acid (-SO3 −) group in the molecule. In this work, based on previous studies on the hydration of alkynes [23,24], a series of P, S-containing carbon-supported copper catalysts were prepared using DESMP as the phosphorus source and sulfur source. We have evaluated the selectivity and stability of the catalyst system in acetylene hydration reaction, the addition of DESMP was effective to promote the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. The significantly improved selectivity and stability showed that we should deeply discuss and recognize this catalytic system. Experimental section Materials Coconut activated carbon (AC, 60-80 mesh) was purchased from Ningxia Huahui Activated Carbon Co., Ltd. CuCl2 (the purity of Cu ≥ 98%) and diethyl (tosyloxy) methyl phosphonate (DESMP) were provided by Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. All the reagents and drugs were analytical grade and used without further purification. Catalyst preparation Cu-DESMPX complex catalysts supported on AC were prepared by the standard impregnation method. Firstly, the desired amount of CuCl2 and DESMP were dissolved in the 20 mL absolute ethyl alcohol. Then, the mixture was stirred at a temperature of room vigorously for 30 min. After that, 3g AC was slowly added into the solution, and the solution was under agitated stirring at room temperature for 20 h. Finally, the homogeneous solution was dried at 80°C in a vacuum for 10 h to get the catalysts. The catalysts without ligands for comparison were prepared in similar procedures. Cu loading in the Cu-based catalysts was fixed at 4 wt%, and catalysts with four molar ratios of CuCl2 and DESMP were (1:0.5, 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2) named Cu-DESMPX/AC (X was 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2). For example, the catalyst Cu-DESMP0.5/AC denoted the Cu metal loadings of 4 wt%, and the molar ratio of CuCl2 and DESMP was 1:0.5. As a control, DESMP/AC catalysts with the same ligand loadings of Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalyst was prepared. Catalyst characterization The samples were degassed for 4 h at 120°C and measured at a liquid nitrogen temperature. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, Micromeritics ASAP 2460 instrument) was used to investigate the specific surface area. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer) was conducted with the monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source (hυ = 1486.6 eV). The binding energy of C 1s (284.80 eV) was used to correct the binding energies of each species. The detection wavelength range of Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) is between 500 and 4000 cm−1 using a Thermo Nicolet Avatar 360 spectrometer. The content of Cu within the catalyst was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Agilent 5110). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to measure the morphology of samples on an FEI Talos F200X instrument with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra with Cu-Kα radiation was carried out on a New Smart Lab Guidance in a 2θ scan range between 10° and 90°. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments have been conducted on an Auto Chem II 2920 instrument. The samples were heated from room temperature to 900°C at a rate of 10°C/min in the H2-Ar mixture atmosphere. Catalytic performance evaluation All catalyst tests were performed in a continuous fixed bed microreactor using a prepared sample of 2 mL supported in a 10 mm reactor for acetylene hydration. 240°C was chosen as the temperature of the reactor, and the N2 was circulated to remove water vapor and the air atmosphere in the reactor for 0.5 h at first. Subsequently, a peristaltic pump was used to add deionized water to the reactor. C2H2 and water vapor were fed through the reactor using the molar ratio of H2O/C2H2 of 4 and a GHSV (C2H2) of 90 h−1. Acetylene flow was tuned through mass-flow-controllers with a flow rate of 3 mL·min−1 and water vapor flow with a flow rate of 0.075 mL·min−1. Finally, the products were analyzed by GC-2014C. (The peak area normalization method was used for the quantitative analysis of products of acetylene hydration. The conversion was calculated to the number of acetylenes reacted divided by the number of acetylenes in the feed gas.) Results and discussion In the continuous fixed bed micro-reactor, the synthesized catalysts were investigated with several different contents, including Cu-DESMP0.5/AC, Cu-DESMP1/AC, Cu-DESMP1.5/AC, and Cu-DESMP2/AC catalysts. The control groups, including Cu/AC and DESMP/AC catalysts, were tested under the same conditions. The conversion of acetylene and selectivity to acetaldehyde for the reaction are shown in Fig. 1 . It is worth noting that the acetylene conversion of the Cu/AC catalyst reduced from 84.0% to 78.0%, and acetaldehyde selectivity decreased from 67.4% to 27.2% after 10 h of reaction. This indicated that the Cu/AC catalyst was rapidly deactivated. However, the selectivity to acetaldehyde achieved the highest (88.4%) of the Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalyst at 10 h, which shows better stability than a previous report by Zhang et al. [21] (The selectivity to acetaldehyde of the Cu-HEDP1/AC catalyst dropped from approximately 92.0% to 82.9% after 8h.). It can be inferred that DESMP has a strong complexation with copper species. In addition, the Cu/AC catalyst without DESMP and the DESMP/AC catalyst without Cu exhibited lower activity and selectivity. The results indicate that the addition of DESMP could effectively improve the performance of Cu-based catalysts. Therefore, to better understand the stability of the Cu-DESMPX/AC catalysts, the Cu/AC and Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalysts were tested for 20 h in the acetylene hydration reaction shown in Fig. 1c and d. During the 20 h reaction, the Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalyst showed high stability, giving a C2H2 conversion of 93.4% and the acetaldehyde selectivity of 79.7%. In comparison, under the same conditions, after the 20 h reaction, the Cu/AC catalyst was rapidly deactivated (The conversion reduced from 86.0% to 56.3%, and the selectivity decreased from 67.4% to 20.4%.). It is clear that the performance of the Cu-DESMPX/AC catalyst improved significantly. Fig. 2 displays the error bars of the experimental results, indicating that experiments could be reliable. To further understand the reason for the good catalytic performance, the obtained XRD patterns of Cu-based samples are presented in Figure S1, and it is worthwhile to observe two obvious diffraction peaks at 2θ of 25°and 43° in all the catalysts. It can be attributed to the (002) and (101) diffraction peaks for the AC support [25]. There are no crystal diffraction peaks assignable to the Cu species, indicating that it exists below the detection limit by the XRD technique or disperses well over the surface of AC. The obtained XRD patterns of used Cu-based samples (20 h) are presented in Figure S1, and two obvious crystal diffraction peaks at 43.3°and 50.3° are observed both in the Cu/AC and Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalysts, corresponding to the (111) and (200) lattice planes of Cu, which can be attributed to the strong reducibility of acetylene in the reaction of acetylene hydration. However, the intensity of the sharp diffraction peak for the Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalyst is weaker than that of the Cu/AC catalyst (The average grain sizes of Cu-DESMP1.5/AC and Cu/AC catalysts are found to be 31.2 nm and 39.2nm by using Scherrer's formula.), suggesting that the introduction of DESMP could retard the reduction to such an extent. Fig. 3 a and b demonstrate the TEM images of the Cu particles in the fresh Cu-based catalysts. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, the black particles of the fresh Cu/AC catalyst can be attributed to the poor dispersion of Cu particles. Notably, for the small particles obviously observed, it can be attributed to the nanoparticles of Cu species. In contrast, the smaller-sized black particles are observed in the fresh Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalyst attributed to the effective dispersion of Cu as a result of the complexation of Cu and ligands. It is well accepted that the dispersion of active species could greatly improve catalytic performance [26]. Meanwhile, the signals of copper and other elemental distribution of the catalyst surface were shown by EDS mapping (Fig. 3c–i), indicating that the dispersion of Cu, P, and S species in the Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalyst performed more uniformly than that of the Cu/AC catalyst. It was worth noting that the mappings of P and S elements are consistent with the distribution of Cu elements, indicating that DESMP itself can coordinate with copper and improve the dispersion of copper. HRTEM performed on the used Cu/AC and Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 . The Cu (111) and Cu (200) crystalline facets are mainly attributed to the cooper species reduction of Cu-based catalysts, which is consistent with the XRD characterization. Furthermore, XPS and XAES were used to investigate the surface features and chemical valence states of the Cu species in both the fresh and used catalysts (Fig. 5 ). The spectra show two peaks at 931–938 eV corresponding to the binding energies of the Cu 2p3/2 spectrum. The Cu 2p3/2 peak of 935.1 eV is corresponded to Cu2+species and the Cu 2p3/2 with a lower binding energy of 933.0 eV is Cu+ and Cu0 species, which is in accordance with previous reports [27,28]. Owing to distinguishing the peaks between the Cu+ signal with the Cu0 signal, XAES spectra was obtained to distinguish the Cu+ and Cu0 species. In the Cu LMM XAES peak fits, three different peaks are observed, two peaks located at around 918.6 and 915.4 eV could be attributed to the Cu0 and Cu+ or Cu2+ respectively [29–31]. Moreover, the deconvolution results of Cu 2p3/2 XPS measuring the contents of surface Cu2+, Cu+ and Cu0 species are shown in Table 1 . It is obvious that the Cu0 species exist in the fresh Cu-based catalysts, which can be assumed to the reduction of activated carbon during the preparation process or the reduction occurring in the XPS beam. The contents of Cu2+, Cu+, and Cu0 are 69.23%, 5.52%, and 25.25% in the fresh Cu/AC catalyst. For the fresh Cu-DESMP1.5/AC, the contents of Cu2+, Cu+, and Cu0 are 72.80%, 22.64% and 4.56%, indicating that the Cu0 species in the Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalyst are much less than that in the fresh Cu/AC catalyst. Thus, the results indicate the addition of DESMP could increase the relative content of Cu2+ and Cu+ to improve the catalytic performance. In contrast to fresh and used Cu-based catalysts, used catalysts were reduced during the reaction to a certain extent. The relative content of Cu0 was increased slightly in the Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalyst after the reaction, suggesting that the addition of DESMP could inhibit the reduction of high-valent copper during acetylene hydration reaction. Overall, the addition of DESMP could inhibit the reduction of high-valent copper both during the preparation of the catalyst and the reaction process. Combining the performance of catalysts, it can be inferred that Cu2+ and Cu+ of Cu-based catalysts are both more conducive to acetylene hydration, which is consistent with the previous research [11,21,32]. Compared with the fresh Cu/AC catalyst, P and S atoms of surface compositions are only in the fresh Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalyst (Fig. 6 a), which must originate from DESMP. Besides, the XPS survey spectra of fresh and used Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalysts show the binding energy of P atoms of used Cu-DESMP1.5 /AC catalyst become higher, indicating that P atoms have a strong complexation with Cu. As shown in Fig. 6c and d, there has a metal sulfate in the catalyst before and after the reaction. According to the results of the experiment, it could be inferred that -SO3 − groups of DESMP could protect active species to enable high activity and stability by forming metal sulfates, which is similar to the previous literature reports [33]. The metal sulfate was achieved due to the interaction of Cu and S atoms, which indicates the -SO3 − groups guarantee the active species to be protected against leaching. To investigate the interaction between CuCl2 and DESMP, some differences in the FTIR spectrums of both four fresh samples were displayed in Fig. 7 a. The peaks in the range of 1600-1450 cm−1, 860-800 cm−1, and 725-680 cm−1 assigned to the para-substituted benzene rings have proved that DESMP was introduced into the activated carbon. The peaks in the regions of 1210-1140 cm−1 are ascribed to the P=O stretching vibrations. Compared with the P=O stretching vibration of DESMP/AC, the characteristic peak of Cu-DESMP1.5/AC at 1025 cm−1 was found in the lower infrared wave number, which is probably ascribed to a redshift under the P=O stretching vibration. The result is attributed to the electron density of P being weakened, which can be caused by the strong complexation strategy between Cu and P=O [34]. These results may explain that there is a coordination of Cu and P atoms in catalysts. To further investigate the excellent properties of Cu-based catalysts for the addition of DESMP, we measured the apparent activation energy. The water vapor ratio was increased (40:1) to ignore the influence of water on the acetylene hydration reaction. As can be seen from Fig. 7b, the apparent activation energy (Ea) decreases significantly with the addition of DESMP. The Ea of the Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalyst(11.14kJ/mol) is far lower than the Ea of the Cu/AC catalyst(43.81kJ/mol). The Cu-based catalysts with DESMP exhibited more active catalytic performance, indicating that the excellent catalytic performance could be attributed to the lower apparent activation energy [35]. Fig. 7c shows the H2-TPR profiles of fresh Cu/AC and Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalysts. There was a typical reduction band in the 500–800°C range, which can probably be ascribed to the hydrogen consumption of oxygen-containing groups on the AC surface [36]. The reduction of Cu2+ at 261ºC for the Cu- DESMP1.5/AC catalyst was 32°C higher than that of the unmodified catalyst, indicating that the chemical environment of Cu2+ had a change with the addition of DESMP. Furthermore, the peak for the reduction of Cu+ in the modified catalyst occurred at the temperature of 471°C, which was 110°C higher than that of the unmodified catalysts. It can be contributed to the strong interaction between P, S ligand and Cu+, which is consistent with the results of the XPS. All results implied that there was a strong function between copper and DESMP. Fig. 7d shows a clear hysteresis loop and the adsorption-desorption isotherms of different catalysts. The hysteresis loop obviously indicated a reduction by further increasing the DESMP amount, which may indicate the mesoporous were blocked after the filling of microporous by the DESMP. The specific surface and pore volumes, and pore diameters of the fresh catalysts are listed in Table 2 . The surface areas and the pore volume of fresh Cu-based catalysts are lower than that of the support AC. Compared with the bare AC with a specific surface area of 1274.96 m²/g and a total pore volume of 0.641 cm³/g, it should be noted that the addition of active species and DESMP of the catalysts led to an obvious decline in both specific surface and pore volume. These findings prove that the copper and DESMP are successfully supported on the AC. It can be directly observed that the specific surface area and the pore volume decreased with increasing the molar ratio of DESMP and Cu from 0 to 1.5 (The surface areas of Cu-DESMPX/AC decreased from 1274.96 to 5.34 m²/g and the pore volume of Cu-DESMPX/AC decreased from 0.471 to 0.011 cm³/g). However, the increase of incorporation content of DESMP leads to the better performance of the Cu-based catalysts. It can be inferred that the addition of DESMP will result in a decline in specific surface area and the excellent catalytic performance is not dependent on the specific surface area. To confirm the influence of P and S atoms of DESMP on catalytic activity, the Cu-1L1.5/AC and Cu-2L1.5/AC were prepared using the wet impregnation method in Fig. 8 (1L containing P atoms without S atoms, 2L containing S atoms without P atoms, 1L and 2L both come from the part of the DESMP). Compared with the Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalyst, these two catalysts exhibited a relatively lower catalytic performance. When 1L is incorporated in Cu-based catalysts, the Cu-based catalysts can reach a high activity but the selectivity declines to 75.1% at 10 h. After the introduction of the 2L ligand, the conversion obtains a few lower than that of the Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalyst and the selectivity can be ignored. It can be inferred that the P fragment of DESMP leads to the high selectivity of acetaldehyde, which is consistent with previous literature reports [22]. The -SO3 − groups improve the stability of the catalytic performance, which is exactly consistent with the XPS result (There is a metal sulfate between Cu and DESMP to guarantee the active species to be protected against leaching.). Based on these characterization results, it can be inferred that the high selectivity and good stability of the catalytic property were performed by the complexing effect of DESMP and Cu species. To further explore the reason for the good catalytic stability, fresh and used Cu-based catalysts were measured by ICP-OES. As listed in Table 3 , the loss ratio of Cu for the Cu/AC is 59.83% after the 10 h reaction while the loss ratio of the Cu-1L1.5/AC catalyst is 36.74% and Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalyst is 13.23%. It can be inferred that the -SO3 − groups of the DESMP could inhibit the loss of the active components during acetylene hydration, which is consistent with the conclusion of Fig. 8. The decrease of Cu loading of the Cu-based catalyst after the test belongs to the leaching of volatile cooper acetylene complex via gas-phase stripping, which is similar to the previous literature report [17]. Comparing ICP with XPS (see Table S1), it can be inferred that Cu loss of the Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalyst originates from surface. Conclusion In conclusion, a sequence of Cu-DESMPX/AC catalysts had high performance in the hydration of acetylene to acetaldehyde. On the basis of these catalytic evaluation results, the addition of DESMP ligands could significantly improve the selectivity and stability of Cu catalysts. The Cu-DESMP1.5/AC catalyst obtained excellent acetylene conversion of 94% and achieved high acetaldehyde selectivity of 88.4% at 10 h under the condition including T= 240°C, GHSV(C2H2) = 90 h−1, V(H2O)/V(C2H2) = 4. On the basis of BET, TEM, XPS, XRD, H2-TPR, FT-IR and ICP measurements, we ascribed the excellent catalytic performance to the coordination between copper species and DESMP ligands. The addition of DESMP could inhibit the loss of the copper species in acetylene hydration, effectively stabilize the catalytic active Cu+ and Cu2+, obviously improve the dispersion of Cu species and significantly decrease the apparent activation energy. Therefore, our study proves that adding the DESMP ligands into Cu-based catalysts could facilitate the selectivity and stability of acetylene hydration. Overall, the results might bring a hopeful candidate for low-cost and green catalyst. CRediT authorship contribution statement Xiejie Chen: Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft.

        "dc:description": "Mercuric chloride catalysts are used to catalyze acetylene hydration for acetaldehyde production with high activity, but high toxicity limits its practical application. Here we present a phosphorus and sulfur ligands-complexed copper catalyst assessed for acetylene hydration. The optimum catalyst gave more than 94.0% acetylene conversion and 88.4% aldehyde selectivity at 10 h. After running for 20 h, the catalyst showed high stability. The conversion to acetylene remained stable at over 93.3% and the selectivity of aldehyde decreased from 92.2% to 79.7%. The accession of phosphorus and sulfur could be highly vigorous for the acetylene hydration reaction. All the catalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS, ICP, TPR, TEM, FT-IR and BET technologies. The results indicate that the selectivity of the catalysts is mainly improved by the P fragment of the ligands, and the S fragment of the ligands could restrain the loss of copper species to improve the stability of the catalysts.",
