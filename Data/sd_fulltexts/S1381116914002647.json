Graphical abstract A new kind of chiral conjugated copolymer P-2 with (S)-BINAP [BINAP=2,2′-bis(diarylphosphino)-1,1′-binaphthyl] and fluorene as the building blocks was synthesized involving Pd[P(p-tolyl)3]3-catalyzed Suzuki-coupling reaction together with reduction of phosphine oxide with HSiCl3/NEt3. The chiral polymer was used to construct chiral Ru/Ir bimetallic dendronized polymer catalysts P-5-m with different generations of Fréchet-type dendritic DPEN [DPEN=1,2-diphenylethylenediamine] ligands through a programmed metal–ligand coordination strategy. These dendronized polymer catalysts were applied to the Ir-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of quinaldine and exhibited excellent activity with moderate enantioselectivity. The reaction rate was increased with increasing generation of the dendronized polymer catalysts, which are better than that obtained from the monomeric catalyst. This interesting positive dendrimer effect might be due to effective shielding of the catalytically active iridium center by the bulky dendritic pendants, which reduced the formation of the inactive iridium dimer. Keywords Dendronized polymer Asymmetric catalysis Bimetallic catalysts Hydrogenation 1 Introduction Dendronized polymer (DP) is an established class of comb polymers, using a polymer as a polyfunctional and polydisperse core, and dendrons pending to the polymer backbone through covalent or non-covalent bonds. It is a single molecule that may extend on the nanometer scale in three dimensions. Since the size and branch number of the side dendrons are tailored precisely during the synthesis of dendrons by variation of generation number, the diameter and flexibility of the DP can be well controlled. The defined interior and the high density periphery of the DP having different chemistry can supply a single molecular microenvironment, and a perfect shielding of the dendronized polymer's core from the environment [1]. Three conceptually synthetic strategies have been adopted to synthesize DP, including graft-to [2], graft-from [3], and macromonomer strategies [4]. Graft-to pathway has the fewest linear synthetic steps. In this route, polymer and dendron can be prepared individually, and then the dendrons are tethered to the polymeric backbone through covalent bonds or non-covalent interactions. The non-covalent way, such as hydrogen bonding [5], ionic pairs [6], metal–ligand interaction [7], and others [8], is less common, but has several advantages over the covalent method the ease of the DP construction, avoiding repeated synthesis and the steric demand of the dendrons effecting on the kinetics of polymerization reaction. Owing to the fact that DP combines the advantages of dendrimer [9] and polymer [10], it has drawn great interest in many research areas [11]. Most importantly, DP may serve as catalyst support that allows for homogeneous catalysis, exhibits an enormous functional group density, cooperative interaction, and isolation effect like dendrimer, and are easily separated from the products like polymer support. Much attention has been drawn on achiral catalyst immobilization on dendronized polymer [12]. In contrast, there are relatively limited reports on chiral dendronized polymer catalysts. Hu et al. reported the first application of chiral dendronized polymer catalyst decorated with (1R,2S)-ephedrine in the catalytic asymmetric addition of Et2Zn to benzaldehyde [13]. Our previous work has shown that different generations of chiral dendronized polymer catalysts have been successfully applied in the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral olefins and ketones [14]. It is worthy to note that these reported chiral dendronized polymer catalysts were uniformly prepared through macromonomer strategy. In addition, chiral DP with two kinds of metals in one support has never been explored [15]. Herein, we reported a new kind of chiral Ru/Ir bimetallic complexes confined in different generations of dendronized polymers by using “attachment through metal coordination” approach [7d] (Scheme 1 ). These catalysts were successfully applied in the asymmetric hydrogenation of quinaldine in excellent yields and moderate enantioselectivities. 2 Experimental 2.1 General details All reactions were carried out under dry nitrogen atmosphere by using standard Schlenk-type techniques. Commercial reagents were used as received without further purification unless otherwise stated. All solvents used were dried applying standard procedures and were distilled under nitrogen atmosphere before use. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Brucker DMX-300 instrument in CDCl3. Chemical shifts (δ) are expressed in ppm downfield from internal TMS. HPLC analyses were performed on a SHIMADZU CTO-10AS using 4.6mm×250mm CHIRALCEL OJ-H column. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were obtained on a BIFLEX III instrument with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CCA) as the matrix. 2.2 Synthetic procedure for polymer P-1 A mixture of monomer (S)-3 [16] (200mg, 0.246mmol), monomer 4 [17] (123mg, 0.246mmol), a drop of Aliquate 336, and freshly prepared Pd[P(p-tolyl)3]3 (10mg, 1.0mol%) was added to a 25mL flask. Degassed THF (3mL) and sodium carbonate (2.0M, 2mL) were added through syringes. The mixture was vigorously stirred at 80°C for 72h under N2 atmosphere, followed by termination with bromobenzene. The mixture was then allowed to cool to room temperature and diluted with CH2Cl2. The desired polymer was obtained in 60% yield (143mg) after precipitating from MeOH.

To the reaction mixture was introduced degassed aqueous sodium hydroxide (30%, 20mL) at 0°C, then stirred at 80°C for 1h. Most solvent was evaporated at reduced pressure, and the residue was extracted with CH2Cl2. The combined organic solution was washed with brine and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The resulting polymer P-2 was obtained in 85% yield as yellow solid after precipitating from MeOH. 1H NMR (300MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.14–8.12 (m, 2H), 7.89–7.86 (m, 2H), 7.60–7.02 (m, 32H), 2.10–1.94 (m, 4H), 1.28–1.16 (m, 12H), 0.83–0.80 (m, 10H). 13C NMR (75MHz, CDCl3): δ 150.0, 144.1, 143.9, 143.6, 139.5, 139.0, 138.3, 136.8, 136.6, 134.4, 133.3, 133.2, 133.0, 132.0, 131.7, 130.7, 128.1, 127.4, 127.0, 126.6, 125.5, 124.6, 124.1, 118.5, 54.2, 39.3, 30.9, 30.6, 30.5, 28.8, 28.6, 28.3, 23.0, 21.6 13.0. 31P NMR (121MHz, CDCl3): δ −14.7. 2.4 Synthesis of monomeric (S)-9 and its iridium complexes The same method applied to the synthesis of P-2 was used (Scheme 3). The obtained crude compound (S)-9 was further purified by column chromatography on silica gel, and a yellow solid was obtained in 80% yield (84mg). The corresponding Ir(I) complex was formed in situ by mixing compound (S)-9 with 0.5equiv. of [Ir(COD)Cl]2. (S)-9: 1H NMR (300MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.89 (d, J =8.50Hz, 2H), 7.83 (d, J =8.15Hz, 2H), 7.77–7.63 (m, 2H), 7.55–7.49 (m, 2H), 7.45–7.42 (m, 6H), 7.35–7.30 (m, 8H), 7.20–7.03 (m, 18H), 6.92–6.87 (m, 2H), 6.83–6.80 (m, 2H), 1.96–1.89 (m, 8H), 1.12–1.02 (m, 24H), 0.75 (t, J =3.54Hz, 12H), 0.61–0.59 (m, 8H); 13C NMR (75MHz, CDCl3): δ 153.0, 150.7, 150.3, 145.5, 145.0, 141.1, 140.1, 140.0, 138.0, 137.5, 137.4, 137.3, 135.6, 134.4, 134.3, 134.2, 134.0, 133.4, 133.2, 133.0, 132.9, 132.7, 130.5, 129.8, 128.4, 128.1, 128.0, 127.7, 127.5, 127.4, 126.9, 126.6, 126.5, 126.1, 125.8, 122.8, 121.0, 120.9, 119.7, 119.6, 55.3, 40.4, 31.4, 29.7, 23.6, 22.5, 13.9. 31P NMR (121MHz, CDCl3): δ −14.2. MALDI-TOF MS for C94H96O2P2 calcd 1472.7 [M+CCA+H]+, found 1471.9. 2.5 Synthetic procedure for polymeric complexes P-5-m Polymer P-2 (40mg, 0.042mmol of BINAP units) and [Ru(benzene)Cl2]2 (5mg, 0.01mmol) in 5mL DMF were heated at 100°C for 1h under N2. After cooling down to room temperature, the solution was treated with the corresponding dendritic diamine ligands Gm-DPEN (G1-DPEN, 18mg, 0.021mmol; G2-DPEN, 35mg, 0.021mmol; G3-DPEN, 71mg, 0.021mmol). After overnight stirring at room temperature, the organic solvent was removed in vacuo. The resulting complexes were mixed with [Ir(COD)Cl]2 (6.7mg, 0.01mmol) in THF for 12h to form the target Ru/Ir complexes P-5-m (m=0, 1, 2), respectively, which were directly used for asymmetric hydrogenation study without further purification. 31P NMR (121MHz, THF): P-5-1, δ 27.1 and 46.5; P-5-2, δ 26.5 and 46.9; P-5-3, δ 27.0 and 47.3ppm. 2.6 General procedure for asymmetric hydrogenation of quinaldine A 25mL glass-lined stainless-steel reactor equipped with a magnetic stir bar was charged with catalyst P-5-m (containing 2.5×10−4 mmol Ir), quinaldine (36mg, 0.25mmol) and I2 (3.2mg, 0.0125mmol) in CH2Cl2 (1mL) under nitrogen atmosphere. The autoclave was closed, and the final pressure of the hydrogen gas was adjusted to 40atm. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for some time. Hydrogen gas was carefully released, and the chiral 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinaldine was purified by column chromatography (hexane/ethyl acetate=1:5, v/v). The enantiomeric excess was determined by HPLC with a chiral OJ-H column. 3 Results and discussion Some chiral complexes comprise of two distinct ligands and a metal center, and both ligands do not disassociate from the metal center during the catalytic process. The Noyori-type ruthenium catalyst, RuCl2-(S)-BINAP-(S,S)-DPEN, is such kind of complexes that contains two classes of important chiral ligands-diphosphine and diamine by using Ru(II) ion as the linking atom. These well-established catalysts have been applied into the asymmetric hydrogenation of simple aryl ketones [18]. We envisage that this ternary complex is a promising motif to build side-chain metal-containing supramolecular dendronized polymers, as shown in Scheme 1. If different generations of dendritic DPEN ligands [19] and the rigid chiral conjugated copolymer ligand bearing many chiral BINAP units in the backbone are obtained, different generations of dendronized polymer catalysts can be fabricated via metal–ligand coordination strategy according to the programmed synthetic procedure for the formation of Noyori-type catalyst. In addition, the remaining free BINAP units on the polymer backbone can further coordinate to the second metal iridium, providing the final chiral Ru/Ir heterobimetallic dendronized polymer catalysts. With this in mind, we started to prepare dendritic DPEN ligands and the conjugated copolymer (S)-6 with BINAP and fluorene as building blocks, respectively (Scheme 2 ). Such rod-like polymer is expected to provide several key features: (1) Rigid backbone may avoid embedment of the diphosphine units and enable complete complexation with metals and further with the second ligand; (2) Fluorene moiety with long alkyl groups may fine tune the solubility of the rigid copolymer, rendering the catalytic reactions being performed in a homogeneous manner; and (3) BINAP has high-affinity binding recognition with transition metal ions, such as Ru(II) and Ir(I) ions. Starting from (S)-BINAP, monomer (S)-3 was obtained in 78% yield through oxidation using H2O2 and followed by a bromination procedure with Br2. With (S)-3 and 4 in hand, Pd(0)-catalyzed Suzuki polycondensation of the two components in 1:1 ratio was carried out. Initially, when 1mol% of Pd(PPh3)4 was used as catalyst, the molecular weight of P-1 was found to be Mn=4800 (PDI=2.3) using polystyrene as the standard. Gratifyingly, when we replaced Pd(PPh3)4 with a more active catalyst Pd[P(p-tolyl)3]3 (1mol%), a higher molecular weight (Mn=19,000) and narrower PDI (1.6) were obtained. Obviously, due to the steric hindrance of the diphenylphosphine oxide group of monomer (S)-3, a more active catalyst is required in the polymerization, and polymer P-1 with high molecular weights was chosen in the further studies. The resulting polymer P-1 was fully characterized by 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR techniques (Figs. S3–S5, see Supporting Information). As seen from the proton spectrum of P-1, the proton signals at δ 6.90–6.99ppm (Ar H, 2H) belonging to BINAPO unit and signals at δ 1.94–2.10ppm (ArCCH 2 , 4H) belonging to the methylene group attached to the quaternary carbon of the fluorene moiety were observed. A 1:2 integral ratio confirms that an alternative copolymer has been obtained. In addition, the 31P NMR spectrum displays a predominate singlet at δ 29.5ppm, almost consistent with that of BINAPO. Reduction of phosphine oxides with HSiCl3/NEt3 led to chiral polymeric ligand P-2. As shown in 31P NMR spectra, the peak at δ 29.5ppm for phosphine oxide disappeared with the simultaneous appearance of a phosphine peak at δ −14.7ppm. Notably, the resulting copolymer P-2 was well soluble in common organic solvents, such as toluene, dichloromethane, chloroform, and THF. Because the diphosphine units of P-2 are sensitive to oxygen, the molecular weight of P-2 were not further analyzed with GPC method. Polymer P-2 has been well characterized by spectroscopic methods including 1H, 13C and 31P NMR (Figs. S7–S9, see Supporting Information). The 31P NMR spectrum of polymer P-2 having a peak at δ −14.7ppm is almost identical to that of (S)-BINAP. For comparison, a model compound of small molecule (S)-9 was also synthesized using the same method. Having the chiral polymeric ligand P-2 in hand, we then investigated the programmed assembly of transition metals and dendritic DPEN ligands. The coordination could be easily monitored by 31P NMR. As shown in Scheme 4 , polymer P-2 was firstly treated with 0.25equiv. of [Ru(benzene)Cl2]2 based on the amount of BINAP units. After stirring at 100°C for 1h, in addition to the peak δ −14.2ppm (free BINAP units), a new peak appeared at δ 28.0ppm in 31P NMR, indicating that BINAP were partially coordinated with Ru(II) ion to form P-3 (Fig. S19, see Supporting Information). Subsequently, different generations dendritic DPEN ligands (Gm-DPEN, m=0, 1, 2, and 1.05equiv to Ru) were added into the above solution of P-3, respectively. To our delight, all Ru(II) complexes in P-3 were converted to the desired ternary Ru(II) complexes P-4-m as confirmed by 31P NMR, which exhibit two peaks at around δ −14.7 and 47.0ppm belonging to the free BINAP units and the BINAP/Ru(II)/Gm-DPEN complexes, respectively. Finally, after the solvent of DMF was removed in vacuum, 0.5equiv. of [Ir(COD)Cl]2 based on the amount of free BINAP units in P-4-m and CH2Cl2 were added. The disappearance of the peak at around δ −14.7ppm for free BINAP along with the appearance of the peak at around δ 27.0ppm for the BINAP/Ir(I) complexes confirmed the formation of the designed Ru/Ir heterobimetallic dendronized polymer catalysts (Figs. S20–S22, see Supporting Information). With catalysts P-5-m in hand, we then evaluated their catalytic properties in the Ir-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of quinaldine [20]. As shown in Table 1 , all dendronized polymer complexes provided obvious higher conversions than the low-molecular-weight counterpart catalyst (S)-9/Ir, and retained similar enantioselectivities. Notably, it was found that the reaction rate increased with increasing generation of the dendronized polymer complexes. The catalytic rate enhancement might be attributed to the better steric shielding created by the higher generation dendritic pendants, which can effectively reduce the dimerization of the catalytically active iridium species, and thereby inhibit catalyst deactivation [21]. 4 Conclusion In summary, we have developed a novel kind of chiral Ru/Ir bimetallic dendronized polymer catalysts constructed through sequential metal coordination method for the first time. These dendronized polymer catalysts shows excellent activity and moderate enantioselectivity in the asymmetric hydrogenation of quinaldine. It should be noted that the reaction rate was increased with increasing generation of the DP catalyst. Moreover, all DP catalysts exhibited obvious higher catalytic efficiency as compared with the low-molecular-weight counterpart Ir-complexes. Further applications of this type of dendronized polymer catalyst in other asymmetric reactions are in progress.

        "dc:description": "A new kind of chiral conjugated copolymer P-2 with (S)-BINAP [BINAP=2,2′-bis(diarylphosphino)-1,1′-binaphthyl] and fluorene as the building blocks was synthesized involving Pd[P(p-tolyl)3]3-catalyzed Suzuki-coupling reaction together with reduction of phosphine oxide with HSiCl3/NEt3. The chiral polymer was used to construct chiral Ru/Ir bimetallic dendronized polymer catalysts P-5-m with different generations of Fréchet-type dendritic DPEN [DPEN=1,2-diphenylethylenediamine] ligands through a programmed metal–ligand coordination strategy. These dendronized polymer catalysts were applied to the Ir-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of quinaldine and exhibited excellent activity with moderate enantioselectivity. The reaction rate was increased with increasing generation of the dendronized polymer catalysts, which are better than that obtained from the monomeric catalyst. This interesting positive dendrimer effect might be due to effective shielding of the catalytically active iridium center by the bulky dendritic pendants, which reduced the formation of the inactive iridium dimer.",
