Introduction Hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to produce valu- able chemicals has received much attention in recent years. Methanol synthesis is one of the most likely applications and has been studied extensively. A number of studies on this reaction have been reported over Cu-based catalysts; various reaction mechanisms have also been proposed by infrared spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption spectroscopy [ 1- 5]. Arakawa et al. [1] and Millar et al. 121 reported that *Corresponding author. Tel.: +81 52 7893388; fax: +81 52 7893388. Cu-formate was the intermediate for methanol synth- esis over Cu-ZnO/SiO2 catalyst. On the other hand, Fujita et ai. [3] showed that methanol was produced via hydrolysis of methoxide species, CH30-Zn, over Cu/ZnO catalyst. Weigel et al. 141 reported that for- mate was not a direct precursor of methanol product, but that surface-bound formaldehyde and methylate were the intermediates on the route to methanol over Cu/ZrO2 and Ag promoted Cu/ZrO2 catalysts. The effects of the second or third components have also been reported [6-1 1 ]. For preparation methods, lnui et al. [12] reported that mixed oxide catalysts prepared by the uniform gelation method exhibited high per- formance for methanol synthesis. However, the influ- ences of these components are not clear. 0926-860X/98/$19.00 ~' 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII S0926-860X(97)0027 I -8 322 N. Nomura et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 321-326 We have conducted hydrogenation of carbon diox- ide to methanol using in situ high-pressure infrared spectroscopy [13-15]. We pointed out that the formate species formed on Cu was a reaction intermediate and that the control of its reactivity was important. The effects of supports were also investigated on the basis of the reaction mechanism [161. TiO~-supported Cu catalyst showed high activity and selectivity, because the catalyst increased the intermediate concentration and promoted hydrogenation of the intermediate to methanol [16]. These results suggested that the further modification of the electronic state of copper species by adding co-catalyst could improve the catalytic properties of CuO/TiO2 catalyst. The present paper reports the effects of co-catalyst addition on TiOz-supported Cu catalyst in order to promote the main reaction (methanol synthesis). In situ infrared spectra of adsorbed species on the cata- lysts were measured using an infrared reactor cell and the reaction mixture was analyzed by a gas chromato- graph at the same time. The relationship between the reactivity of adsorbed species and the catalytic per- formance (activity and selectivity) was discussed from the spectra and the analytical data of the reaction products. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Table 1 summarizes the standard compositions of tested catalysts. CuO-P2OJTiO2 and CuO-K20/TiO2 catalysts were prepared by impregnating phosphoric acid or potassium hydroxide on CuO/TiO2 catalyst, Table I Standard composition of tested catalysts Catalyst Comlx~sition (wt%) for kinetic study for infrared study TiO2 -- 10~1 CuOFFiOz 30 : 70 5 : 95 CuO-K20/TiO2 30 : 3 : 67 5 : 0.5 : 94.5 CuO-P2Os/TiO2 30 : 3 : 67 5 : 0.5 : 94.5 CuO-ZrO2/TiO2 30 : 30 : 40 5 : 5 : 90 CuO-ZnOt'I'iO2 30 : 30 : 40 5 : 5 : 90 tollowed by drying at 393 K for 2-3 h and calcining in air at 633 K for 6 h. For CuO-ZrO2/TiO2 and CuO- ZnO/TiO2 catalysts, they were prepared by copreci- pitating copper and zirconium (or zinc) from their nitrates solution. A sodium carbonate solution was added to the nitrate solution at 328 K, which sus- pended Ti()2 panicles (P-25, Degussa). Precipitates were filtered, washed with distilled water, dried at 393 K for 6 h and finally calcined in air at 633 K for 6 h. The standard loading of copper was 30 wt% as CuO for the kinetic study, but the loading was reduced to 5 wt% for the infrared study in order to keep the infrared transparency. 2.2. Reaction procedure The methanol synthesis reaction was carried out with a conventional continuous flow reactor at a pressure of 1.0 MPa. The catalyst (0.5 g) was packed in a stainless steel reactor. The standard reaction conditions were as follows: mole ratio of H2/ CO2 = 4/1, W/Fco2.o = 43 kg-cat s/mol and T= 513 K. The pressure of the reactants was increased to 1.0 MPa with a constant flow-rate ratio of the reactants. The temperature of the catalyst bed was then gradually raised at about 10 K/min to the reaction temperature and the measurements were started. The reaction mixture was analyzed by a TCD gas chromatograph connected to the reactor through a gas sampling valve. 2.3. hi situ infrared spectra measurement In situ infrared spectra were measured, using an infrared reactor cell made of stainless steel. It was designed for elevated pressure and temperature. In this case, a catalyst was pressed into a disk (10ram diameter and 0.2 mm thickness) and placed in the reactor cell. The spectra were obtained with a JASCO FI'/IR-300 spectrometer at a resolution of 4 cm- while the cell was operated as a reactor. The pressure of the reactants was increased to 1.0 MPa with the constant flow-rate ratio of the reactants. The tempera- ture of the catalyst bed was raised to the reaction temperature, then the spectra were measured. There- tore, the spectra and the results of the reaction product were obtained at the same time. N. Nomura et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 321-326 323 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Effects of co-catalyst In the previous study on the effect of supports, acid- base properties of the supports affected the activity and selectivity. Therefore, some additives to CuO/ TiO2 which have characteristic acid-base nature were examined in order to modify the electronic state of copper species. The reaction was carried out at 513 K on the catalysts with additives. Then, the effects of co- catalyst on activity and selectivity were investigated using the continuous flow reactor. The results are summarized in Table 2. Although P205 was expected to improve the metha- nol selectivity [16], it did not show any activities. During the preparation, copper probably reacted with phosphoric acid directly and an inactive compound was formed. This resulted in the deactivation of the cata- lyst. lndeed, the color of this catalyst was sea green, which was similar to the color of copper phosphate. On the other hand, addition of K increased the conversion and CO selectivity. This corresponds well to the promotional effect of MgO support [16]. With the addition of ZrO2, the conversion increased and the methanol selectivity decreased, but these effects were not so large. In the case of ZnO, the methanol yield was 3.37% (= 15.4 0.219), while that of CuO/TiO2 catalyst without additive was 1.36% (= 3.2 0.425). The methanol yield increased as follows: P < K < CuO/TiO2 without additive = Zr < Zn. Thus, ZnO additive improved the methanol yield (2.5 times higher than that of CuO/TiO2 cata- lyst). We pointed out that amphoteric supports could adsorb CO2 to form adsorbed tbrmate species (with the base nature) and could activate the formate species (with the acid nature) for hydrogenation to form methanol 116]. The above results of additives in the present study also agree with the effect of amphoteric supports, Table 2 also indicates the reaction results in the infrared cell obtained during the measurements of the spectra. The conversions were lower than those of the continuous flow reactor due to the low copper loading. TiO2 support did not show any activities without Cu, but the reaction occurred by adding Cu. Addition of K predominantly produced CO. In the case of ZnO, the methanol yield was higher than that of CuOfI'iO2 catalyst. P addition also proceeded the reaction with the infrared cell unlike the continuous flow reactor. In this case, the methanol selectivity improved slightly, while the activity decreased as compared with those of CuO/TiO2. We pointed out that the acidic support exhibited high selectivity but low activity [16]. The effect of P agreed well with the effect of acidic supports. The methanol yield increased as lbllows: P < K < CuO/TiO2 without additive < Zr < Zn. The order obtained from the infrared cell was the same as that obtained from the continuous flow reactor. The above-mentioned results indicate that the effects of the additives on 5%-Cu catalysts are almost the same as those of 30%-Cu catalysts in the viewpoint of methanol yield. Therefore. in situ infrared spectro- scopic study was conducted with 5%-Cu catalysts. 3.2. In situ infrared .spectroscopic study The catalysts with 5% loading of CuO were pre- pared and tested in the infrared reactor cell. The infrared spectra were obtained during the reaction.

Fig. 1 shows infrared spectra of CuO/TiO2 at var- ious temperatures (room temperature - 513 K) in CO2 + H2 flow. At room temperature and atmospheric pressure (Fig. l(a)), the bands at 1570 and 1445 cm i were observed, indicating the formation of carbonate on the surface (TiO2) [17,181. Their intensities decreased with mcrease In the temperature. Fig. I(b--d) show the spectra of CuO/TiO2 at 423 K and I MPa, at different times ( 10, 30 and 60 mini from exposure of the reactants. At this temperature, the intensities of the bands due to carbonate disappeared, while other bands developed at 2955, 2930, 2873, I 2851, 1568, 1559, 1542. 1373 and 1363cm (Fig. I (b)). They were ascribed to the surface formate species which was assumed to be an intermediate for methanol synthesis from CO2 [I,2,5]. Among them. the bands at 2955, 2873, 1559, 1542 and 1363 cm- i were identified as lbrmate species on titania [16,181, while 2930, 2851, 1568 and 1373 cm i were identi- tied as formatc species on copper [16,19,20]. Their intensities increased with time and then reached the steady state after 60 min (Fig. I(c and d)). Above 473 K, all the intensities of the bands duc to adsorbed species reached the steady state in a short time. At 473 K, the bands at 2927 and 2828 cm ~ started to appear (Fig. l(e)). These bands were ascribed to methoxy species formed by further hydrogenation of the formate species [201. Above 473 K (Fig. l(e and f)), methanol was detected in the gas phase together with development of the methoxy species. These results agreed well with the proposed mechanism in the case of alumina support 113]: that is, the surface tbrmate species on Cu were converted to the surface methoxy species and hydrogenated to methanol. Furthermore, we have showed that the tormate species on TiO2 was also used in the reaction while the tbrmate on A1203 was inactive [161. There- fore. modification of the electronic state of the formate species on both Cu and TiO2 has to be realized by adding co-catalyst. Fig. 2 shows the effects of co-catalyst on in situ infrared spectra. In the case of TiO2 alone, the formate species was tbrmed, but the intensity was not so high ' ' formate/Cu -- ~, i,.

In ~,itu infrared spectra of CuO-ZnO/TiO2 catalyst at I MPa: (a) 473 K: (bl 513 K; and (c) 533 K. (Fig. 2(a)). The formate species on Cu was developed when Cu was supported on Ti02 (Fig. 2(b)). When K was added as one of the typical base components, the adsorption of CO2 was enhanced and an increase in the formate species on Cu was observed (Fig. 2(c)). On the other hand, the formate species on Cu decreased slightly when P was added (Fig. 2(d)). Addition of ZrO2 increased the amount of the formate species on Cu (Fig. 2(e)). Furthermore, addition of ZnO increased the amount of the formate species on Cu markedly (Fig. 2(13). The intensity of the bands due to formate on Cu increased as follows: P<CuO/ TiO2 < K = Zr < Zn. The order was the same as that of conversion obtained from the infrared cell. This supports our working hypothesis on the effects of co- catalyst mentioned in Section 3.1. In the case of Zn, the peaks of absorption slightly shifted toward higher wave numbers. This indicated that addition of ZnO affected the active formate species. Several ideas about the effect of zinc species have been proposed [9,10, I 1,21-23]. Neophytides et al. 122] suggested that zinc species played an impor- tant role in mcxtifying the electronic properties of metallic copper, thereby inducing changes in its catalytic activity. This promotional effect can prob- ably be applied to the result obtained from CuO-ZnO/ TiO2 catalyst in our study. The reaction temperature was varied (473-533 K) and the spectra were taken over CuO-ZnO/TiO2. The results are shown in Fig. 3. The intensities of both formate and methoxy species decreased with reaction temperature. On the contrary, the conversion of CO2 increased with reaction temperature from 0.14% (at 473 K) to 1.60% (at 533 K). These results showed that the reaction rates of the rate-determining steps such as hydrogenation of the surface intermediate (methoxy species) and decomposition of the formate species to CO were notably enhanced with the increase in reac- tion temperature. 4. Conclusion It was concluded in this study that addition of the amphoteric component was effective as a co-catalyst. CuO-ZnOfI'iO2 showed an excellent performance. In this case. the amount of adsorbed formate species on Cu increased markedly. References l l] H. Arakawa, K. Sayama. K. Okabc. K. Shimomura. H. Hagiwara, Shokubai (Catalyst) 33 (19911 103. [21 G.J.

Among them, Zn addition increased the amount of adsorbed formate species markedly and obtained the highest methanol yield.

        "dc:description": "The effects of co-catalyst were studied on the methanol-synthesis reaction from carbon dioxide and hydrogen over various TiO2-supported copper catalysts. The catalytic activities with a continuous flow reactor were measured together with in situ infrared spectra at the elevated temperature and pressure. Phosphorus did not show any activity. Potassium showed a high activity but promoted CO formation. ZnO had a high activity and a high methanol selectivity. ZrO2 also showed promotion effect to some extent. By in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the formate species formed on Cu was observed over CuO/TiO2 catalyst. The amount of the formate species depended on the kinds of additive. Addition of K, Zr and Zn showed high activity and increased the intensities of the formate species. On the other hand, addition of P decreased the activity and the intensities of the formate species.
