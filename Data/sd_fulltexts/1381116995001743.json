Pugin Central Research Services, Ciba, R-I055.629, CH-4002 Basle, Switzerland Abstract Functionalized PPM (PPM: (2S,4S)-4-diphenylphosphino-2-(diphenylphosphino-methyl) pyrrolidine), a chiral diphosphine ligand, was bound to silica gel with different loadings [mmol ligand/g support] and used as model to detect possible effects of site isolation in the enantioselective hydrogenation of methyl-acetamidecinnamate (MAC) with cationic and with neutral Rh- catalysts and of N-(2-methyl-6-ethylphen-l-yl)methoxymethylmethylketimin (MEI) with an Ir-catalyst. To investigate the influence of high local catalyst concentration in absence of a support, two new bis-PPM ligands with spacers of different length were prepared and tested. The results indicate that site isolation effects occur with two of the catalytic systems used: Whereas immobilized cationic Rh-catalysts are practically not affected, the neutral Rh-catalysts lose most of their activity with increasing catalyst loading. Probably, this is due to the formation of chloride-bridged Rh-dimers which is favored by high catalyst concentration as indicated by experiments with the bis-PPM-ligands. Immobilization has a spectacular effect with the Ir-system. It is known that Ir-complexes in presence of hydrogen can form stable hydrogen-bridged dimers that are catalytically inactive. The fact that the activity (and also productivity) of the immobilized catalysts increases with decreasing catalyst loading indicates, that the formation of these dimers can be prevented by immobilization.

Introduction Rh, Ru and Ir diphosphine complexes belong to the most developed class of homogeneous enan- tioselective catalysts. Although many of these cat- alysts are highly active and selective in the hydrogenation of a large variety of unsaturated prochiral substrates, only few have been used on an industrial scale. Among others, one important technical problem is the separation and recovery of the soluble catalyst. Much effort has been made to solve this problem by anchoring such catalysts on a support [ 1 ]. However, in most cases immo- bilization has caused severe reduction of the cat- alytic activity. Only few investigations on 1381-1169/96/$15.00 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDI 1381- 1 169(95)00174-3 possible causes have been made. There are indi- cations that besides the preparation method, other factors like e.g. the pore size of insoluble supports [ 2] or, when working with organic polymer sup- ports, the choice of solvent plays a major role [ 3 ]. So far, only very little attention has been paid to possible effects of catalyst loading [mmol cata- lyst/g support] with this important class of catalysts. With different types of immobilized catalysts it has been shown that catalyst loading can indeed have important effects on catalyst performance [4]. The most prominent example is the hydro- genation of alkenes with titanocene-catalysts [ 5- 8]. These homogeneous catalysts have a strong 274 B.

Ligands used for tendency to react irreversibly, forming dimers that are no more catalytically active. Site isolation, that is attaching these catalysts to a support in such a way that they can no more interact with each other, prevents their deactivation and enhances their activity and productivity. A mathematical model that describes the observed reaction rate in func- tion of catalyst loading was proposed and shown to match very well with the experimental results [6]. We have developed an efficient method for the immobilization of chiral diphosphine ligands and are now studying factors that may have an effect on catalytic performance [2]. Using free and immobilized (2S,4S)-4-diphenylphosphino-2- (diphenylphosphino-methyl) pyrrolidine (PPM) as model-ligands (Fig. 1 ) we herein describe the influence of catalyst loading in the enantioselec- tive hydrogenation of methyl-acetamidecinna- mate (MAC) with cationic Rh-complexes (with BF~- as an non coordinating anion) and neutral Rh-complexes (with CI-, an anion that forms covalent bonds) and the hydrogenation of N-(2- methyl-6-ethylphen-l-yl) methoxymethylme- thylketimin (MEI) with an Ir-complex.

Experimental All reactions involving phosphines and the manipulations in the hydrogenation experiments were carried out under an argon or nitrogen atmos- phere and with deoxygenated solvents. N-(2- methyl-6-ethylphen- 1-yl) methoxymethyl- methylketimin (MEI) was prepared by conden- sation of 2-methyl-6-ethylaniline with methoxy- acetone and distilled before use. The immobilized PPM-ligands were prepared as described previ- ously [2], using Merck 100 silicagel (SBET = 322 m2/g; particle size=200-500 /zm; mean pore diameter=14 nm) and Grace 332 silicagel (SBET=325 mZ/g; particle size=35-70 /xm; mean pore diameter= 19 nm) as supports. 2.1.

Hydrogenation of MAC with neutral Rh- catalysts The same procedure and the same conditions for hydrogenation were used as with cationic Rh- catalysts, except that a solution of 6.25 /xmol of [Rh(cod)C1]2 in 2.5 ml of toluene were used to form the catalyst precursor and that the substrate solution consisted of 2.5 mmol MAC in 20 ml methanol.

Hydrogenation of MAC with cationic Rh- catalysts 1.25 equivalents of ligand were gently stirred in a round bottom flask with a solution of 12.5 /zmol [ Rh(cod) 2] BF4 (cod: 1,5-cyclooctadiene) in 2.5 ml methanol. In the case of supported cat- alysts a deeply orange catalyst and a colorless solution was obtained within less than 5 min. After 10 min. a solution of MAC (2.5 mmol) in 15 ml methanol and 5 ml THF was added, the atmos- phere of Argon was changed to hydrogen and the hydrogenation started by switching on the mag- netic stirrer with 1000 rpm. The hydrogenations were carried out at 25 and a hydrogen pressure of I bar. Gas chromatography was used to monitor the reaction (column: SE 54, 15 m) and to deter- 2.5.

After 10 min, a solution of 2 g (9.8 mmol) MEI in 16 ml toluene/methanol 1/1 was added and the mixture was transferred with argon through a capillary into a 50 ml steel autoclave. The mixture was evacuated and flushed with hydrogen three times and the hydrogen pres- sure was finally set to 40 bar. The batch was stirred at 25 and the course of the hydrogenation was followed by observing the drop in pressure in the autoclave. The conversion was analyzed by gas- chromatography (column: SE 54, 15 m). The sup- ported catalysts were separated by filtration. After evaporation of the solvent, the crude product was purified by flash chromatography (silica gel Merck 60, hexane/methyl acetate 1:1) and the enantiomer excess was determined by polarimetry [9]. 3.

We have often observed that the perform- ance of these catalysts improves when they are reused. Therefore, the results for the first and sec- ond run are given. The reused catalysts have a very similar performance as their homogeneous counterparts, and belong to the most effective immobilized enantioselective catalysts known. As is shown with the bis-PPM tigands, variation of the local catalyst concentration has no effect on activity and selectivity. All these findings indicate that cationic diphosphine-Rh-catalysts have no tendency to interact with each other. The neutral catalysts are about 2-3 times less active than the cationic catalysts and, in contrast to the cationic catalysts, clearly loose activity when their loading is increased. It can be ruled out, that mass-transport inhibition due e.g. to a possible reduction of the pore size by a denser coating of the pore-surface is responsible for the result, since in that case an even stronger decrease in activity should be observed with the more active Table 1 cationic catalysts. The experiments with bis-PPM show, that the activity of the neutral catalysts also decreases with increasing local concentration. Based on these results we conclude that the neutral diphosphine Rh-complexes do interact with each other in a way that is detrimental for their catalytic performance. Several observations reported in the literature indicate that less active or inactive chlo- rine-bridged dimers are formed: It was shown that homogeneous DIOP-Rh-chloride catalysts deac- tivate by a second-order process with respect to the catalytically active species. This deactivation was ascribed to the formation of chlorine-bridged dimers [ 10]. Also, it was found in hydrogenation and hydrosilylation reactions with neutral Rh-cat- alysts bound to immobilized monophosphines of the type Silicagel-Si-(CH2)n-PPh2 that the cat- alytic activity was significantly higher with short spacers than with long ones [ 11,12]. This was attributed to the difference in nature of the cata- lytic species formed on the surface.

No explanation can be given for the signifi- cantly lower selectivity of the immobilized neutral catalysts. The fact that the selectivity is not influ- enced by the local catalyst concentration (see experiments with BPPM and bis-PPM ligands) indicates that additional factors like e.g. interac- tions with the support surface may also be important. It is interesting to note that with only very few exceptions, all immobilized enantioselective Rh- diphosphine catalysts that have been reported in the literature so far were neutral [ 1] and were much less active than their homogeneous analogs. This may be due to improper preparation or choice of the supports, or, as indicated by our experi- ments, in some cases also to catalyst deactivation caused by the formation of inactive dimers. 3.2. Hydrogenation of MEl with lr-catalysts We have recently developed a new class of Ir- catalyst for the enantioselective hydrogenation of imines (Fig. 3) [9]. These catalysts are highly active but have a strong tendency to deactivate. NMR-experiments indicated that deactivation may be due to the formation of hydride-bridged Ir-dimers as they have been observed in the hydro- genation of alkenes [13]. We were therefore interested to see whether deactivation can be avoided by preventing the active sites to interact. The results in Table 2. show that this is indeed possible. While the homogeneous Ir-BPPM cata- lyst is deactivated after 26% conversion, the immobilized catalysts are much more active and productive. The fact that their activity increases with decreasing catalyst loading is a clear indica- MEI Table 2 Influence of catalyst loading on the hydrogenation of MEI with IR catalysts Ligand Loading mol lig/g support rateo~va ~ ee BPPM 0 b 45.2 Si-PPM-1 0.016 5.1 55.2 Si-PPM-2 0.058 2.4 55.5 Si-PPM-4 0.19 0.45 4.8 See experimental part for experimental details.

No explanation can be given for the significantly better selectivity of the immobilized catalysts. To our knowledge there is only one other exam- ple for an immobilized enantioselective Ir-catalyst described in the literature [ 14]. Similarly as we observed with our catalysts, heterogenization of functionalized chiral diamine-Ir-complexes through copolymerization resulted in catalysts that were significantly more active and selective in the transfer-hydrogenation of ketones. 3.3. Discussion of site isolation General aspects If k is the rate of a monomeric catalyst for a given reaction and this catalyst forms inactive dimers with an equilibrium constant K, the observed reaction rate will depend on k, K and the catalyst concentration. The hydrogenations with free BPPM were run with a catalyst concentration of about 6.10 4 mol/1. With bis-ligands the cat- alyst concentration is estimated to be much higher: 0.27 mol / 1 for PPM-C 12-PPM and 0.79 mol/1 for PPM-C6-PPM (based on the assumption that two catalyst-molecules are within a sphere with a 0.2% catalyst H~\"~u~ + H2 (40 bar) catalyst: 1.2 ligand + 0.5 [Ir(cod)CI]2 + 2 NBu41 Fig. 3.

Observed rates of hydrogenations of MAC with neutral Rh and of MEI with Ir as a function of catalyst loading. The calculations are based on n =4; specific surface area of the support = 324 m2/g. The catalyst site area (1.74 nm2) and the rate of the monomeric Rh-catalyst ( 14.4 min- ~ (max. TOF) ) was obtained from a least squares fit of our Rh-results. The same catalyst site area was used to fit the rate of the monomeric Ir-catalyst (5.7 min- ~ (TOF at 50% conversion) ). diameter of a stretched bis-PPM ligand). Accord- ingly, the formation of dimers and deactivation will be highly favored with the bis-ligands. In contrast to free catalysts, immobilized catalysts have a fraction of catalytic sites which are suffi- ciently close to each other to interact and another fraction of sites that are completely isolated. It can be assumed that the first fraction will behave like catalysts with bis-ligands, that is, the probability for the formation of inactive dimers will be very high, while the second fraction will remain active. If the catalytic sites can be bound to the support surface with random distribution, the ratio between these two fractions can be controlled by the catalyst loading. Therefore, with such immo- bilized catalysts, the observed reaction rate will mainly depend on the catalyst loading. Fit of our results with a mathematical model A mathematical model that describes the observed reaction rate as a function of catalyst loading has been proposed [6]. It is based on the assumption that the catalyst-molecules are bound in a random distribution on a rigid surface and that if two catalyst-molecules are within reaction dis- tance they become inactive. The equation of this model can be adapted for experiments, where the number of catalyst molecules is kept constant and only the catalyst loading is varied. The equation then is: rateobsvd = k( 1 - p)\" where k = rate constant of monomeric catalyst p= (moles loaded) (6.023 1023*(area of each complex) /(total surface area of support) n = 4 or 6 for squares sites or circular sites ( 1 - p)': fraction of catalyst molecules that can- not form dimers Although our experiments are only semiquan- titative, we tried to fit the observed rates for neutral Rh and for Ir. From a non-linear least square fit with the Rh-results, we obtained the area of the catalytic site ( 1.74 nm2) and the rate of the mon- omeric Rh-catalyst (14.3 min-~ (max. TOF)). As was observed with titanocenes [6], this site area is significantly smaller than expected. In the case of titanocenes this was accounted for by rec- ognizing that the dimerization reaction may require a very specific relative orientation and that B. Pugin / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 10711996) 273-279 279 the normal surface area measurements may not truly reflect the solution reaction area. In our reac- tions, the formation of dimers may not be irre- versible and the dimers not completely inactive. This may also be reflected in this apparent site area. The same catalytic site area was used to fit the rate of the monomeric Ir-catalyst (5.7 min- t (TOF at 50% conversion) ). As is shown in Fig. 4 the experimental data are in good agreement with the calculated curve. This is a further support for the occurrence of site isolation effects. 3.4. Practical aspects The fact that catalyst loading can have a strong influence on catalyst performance has important implications on the preparation and the usefulness of immobilized catalysts. In all cases, catalysts that are not affected by high local concentrations are preferred. With catalysts which deactivate through interactions between themselves site iso- lation has to be achieved. To do so, large amounts of support are required: Our immobilized catalyst with the lowest loading has a weight of 63 kg per mole and, according to the above model has about 85% of isolated sites. Due to the low specific weight of the highly porous silicagel supports these 63 kg correspond to a catalyst volume of about 180 1/mol. In a hydrogenation with a sub- strate/catalyst ratio of 1000 and a substrate with a molecular weight of 200 g the volumes of the catalyst and of the substrate will be about the same. It is obvious that the handling of such large amounts of supports for the catalyst-preparation and in catalytic processes will be circumstantial and expensive. Therefore, the practical use of such catalysts will be restricted.

Pugin Central Research Services, Ciba, R-1055.629, CH-4002 Basle, Switzerland Functionalized PPM (PPM: (2S,4S)-4-dihpenylphosphino-2-(diphenylphosphino-methyl) pyrrolidine), a chiral diphosphine ligand, was bound to silica gel with different loadings [mmol ligand/g support] and used as model to detect possible effects of site isolation in the enantioselective hydrogenation of methyl-acetamidecinnamate (MAC) with cationic and with neutral Rh-catalysts and of N-(2-methyl-6-ethylphen-1-yl) methoxymethylmethylketimin (MEI) with an Ir-catalyst. To investigate the influence of high local catalyst concentration in absence of a support, two new bis-PPM ligands with spacers of different length were prepared and tested. The results indicate that site isolation effects occur with two of the catalytic systems used: Whereas immobilized cationic Rh-catalysts are practically not affected, the neutral Rh-catalysts lose most of their activity with increasing catalyst loading. Probably, this is due to the formation of chloride-bridged Rh-dimers which is favored by high catalyst concentration as indicated by experiments with the bis-PPM-ligands. Immobilization has a spectacular effect with the Ir-system. It is known that Ir-complexes in presence of hydrogen can form stable hydrogen-bridged dimers that are catalytically inactive. The fact that the activity (and also productivity) of the immobilized catalysts increases with decreasing catalyst loading indicates, that the formation of these dimers can be prevented by immobilization.
