Tokyo, Japan Received 4 February 1996; accepted 17 September 1996 Abstract The transesterification of dimethyl carbonate with phenol to produce methyl phenyl carbonate was carried out in an autoclave using a variety of solid catalysts. M003/Si02 was found to have a very high activity for this transesterification. Thus, a 17.1 % yield of methyl phenyl carbonate based on phenol was obtained at 433 K in the presence of M003/Si02. M003/Si02 was also an active catalyst for the disproportion ation of methyl phenyl carbonate into diphenyl carbonate and dimethyl carbonate. A 48% yield of diphenyl carbonate was attained over M003/Si0= at 443 K. These yield values are probably very close to those at the thermodynamic equilibrium.

Introduction Polycarbonates are important engineering thermoplastics with good mechanical and optical properties as well as electrical and heat resistance useful for many applications [1]. Polycarbonates are commercially produced by the reaction between a bisphenol-A salt in an aqueous caustic solution and phosgene in an organic solution. The main disadvantages of this phosgene process are: (1) The high toxicity and corrosiveness of phosgene, (2) the complex clean-up to remove ionic materials, and (3) the Corresponding author.

PIIS1381-1169(96)00409-8 use of a copious amount of methylene chloride, a water-soluble toxic solvent. The most practical non-phosgene process for manufacturing polycarbonates is the melt transesterification of diphenyl carbonate (DPC) with bisphenol-A. In this method, no toxic solvents are used and the by-product phenol may be recycled. DPC has been prepared by the reaction of phenol and phosgene in the presence of bases such as sodium hydroxide [2,3]. The obvious disadvantages of this method are the use of corrosive and toxic phosgene as a raw material and the formation of stoichiometric amount of NaCl. Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) can be used as a substitute for phosgene in the synthesis of DPC with traditional transesterification catalysts such 294 Z.-h. Fu, Y. Ono /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 118 (1997) 293-299 as Lewis acid and soluble organic Al, Ti, Sn compounds [4-9].

Therefore, the development of active solid catalysts is highly desirable. However, the reports on solid catalysts are very few [10]. Another disadvantage of the direct transesterification of DMC with phenol into DPC is that the formation of DPC is not thermodynamically favored [11]. A two-step process, consisting of the transesteration to MPC into methyl phenyl carbonate (MPC) and the disproportionation of MPC into DPC and DMC offers the most attractive route to DPC [12],[13]. CHsO~OCHg + 0_OH --~ (3-OCHs + CH30H p tj~-OCH' - CH30COCHS + Imi 0 00 (3) In this work, we attempted to search active solid catalysts for the transesterification and the disproportionation. Here, we report that Mo03/Si02 is an effective catalyst for both the transesterification of DMC with phenol and the disproportionation of MPC into DPC. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts Mo03/Si02 and V205/Si02 catalysts were prepared by conventional impregnation of Si02 (101 m2 g-', average pore size 31 nm) with an aqueous solution of (NH4)6Mo7024 ~ 4H20 and NH4V03 (Kanto Chemical), respectively. The water was evaporated to dryness at 333 K using a rotary evaporator, followed by drying the solid in an oven at 393 K overnight and calcining it in a muffle furnace at 823 K overnight. The surface areas of Si02, 10 wt% Mo03/Si02 and 25 wt% M003/Si02 were 101, 84, 75 m2 g-', respectively. Mo02/Si02 was prepared by reducing Mo03/Si02 in flowing hydrogen at 673 K for 4 h, and the formation of Mo02 was confirmed by XRD. TiOZ/Si02 and Zr02/SiOz catalysts were prepared by impregnating SiOz with a benzene solution of titanium isopropoxide and zirconium butoxide (Kanto Chemical), respectively, followed by drying to remove the solvent and heating in an oven at 573 K overnight. Nb205/Si02 was prepared by impregnating Si02 with an aqueous solution of niobium oxalate, followed by drying at 393 K overnight and calcining at 773 K in air overnight. Y(OAc)3/Si02, La(OAc)3/Si02, Pr(OAc)3/Si02 and Sm(OAc)3/Si02 were prepared by impregnating Si02 with an aqueous solution of the corresponding acetate, followed by heating at 523 K. The anhydrous rare earth acetates were reported to be stable at 523 K and decomposed only above 673 K [14]. Y203/Si02, Pr601/Si02, Nd203/SiOz, Sm203/Si02 were prepared by calcining the corresponding acetates supported on SiOz at 723 K, 993 K, 1073 K, and 1023 K, respectively. The other metal oxides on Si02 were also prepared by calcining the corresponding acetates supported on Si02. A mesoporous silica, FSM-16, was a kind Z.-h. Fu, Y. Ono /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 118 (1997) 293-299 gift of Dr. S. Inagaki of Toyota Central R&D Labs. NaOEt/A1203 and CsOH/A1203 was prepared according to the procedures reported in literature [15,16], respectively. Al (powder) and zirconium acetylacetonate (guaranteed reagent grade, Kanto Chemical) were used as received. 2.2. Reaction procedures The transesterification of phenol and DMC was carried out as follows: Phenol, DMC and a catalyst were introduced into an autoclave (50 ml), and air in autoclave was replaced by nitrogen. The autoclave was heated to the reaction temperature at a rate of 7 K min-'. After the reaction, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, and the products were filtered and analyzed with a gas chromatograph equipped with a capillary column (50 m, OV101) and a flame ionization detector. The disproportionation of MPC was conducted in an autoclave (50 ml) or in a flask (30 ml) equipped with a distillation apparatus. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Transesterification of DMC with phenol 3.1.1. Catalytic activities of various catalysts A variety of catalysts were prepared and examined their catalytic activities for the transesterification (Eq. (1)). The reaction was carried out in an autoclave. The reaction conditions were as follows; reaction temperature = 433 K, phenol = 2.24 g (23.8 mmol) and DMC/phenol = 5.0. Table 1 shows the activities of solid acid and base catalysts. In general, solid acids and bases are not active for the transesterification and give anisole as the main product, instead. Especially, K2C03 and CsOH supported on alumina were very selective for the formation of anisole. Amberlyst 15, a well-known transesterifica- 295 tion catalyst, gave a MPC yield of 1.2%, an anisole yield being 26.1 %. H-ZSM-5 showed almost the same results as Amberlyst 15. It was reported that acids and bases catalyzed the decarboxylation of MPC to yield anisole [ 17,18]. Therefore, anisole may be formed by the direct methylation of phenol with DMC as well as by the decarboxylation of primary product (MPC) catalyzed by acid or base as shown below. CH90COCH3+Q 1?-OH - 11 aOCHy + CHSOH + C02 o , - C0Z (( )rOCOCH3 + CH30H 0 The catalytic activities of silica-supported metal acetates for the transesterification are listed in Table 2. The loading amount of the acetate was 10 wt% of the support. It was confirmed that silica gel showed almost no activity for the formation of MPC as well as anisole. The acetates of rare earth metals gave reasonable yields of MPC, though the formation of anisole was always observed. Nd(OAc)3 gave a MPC yield of 15.9%, an anisole yield being 4.2%. Fe(OH)(OAc)2 and Cd(OAc)z gave high selectivities for MPC. Fe(OH)(OAc)2 gave a 10.7% yield of MPC, an anisole yield being 0.3%. The acetates of alkaline earth metals showed low selectivity for MPC. The catalytic activities of metal oxides supported on silica are listed in Table 3, in which the oxides are listed in the most probable form at the corresponding calcination temperatures. The loading amount of the precursor compounds was 10 wt% of the support as the corresponding oxides. Among the supported oxides, M003/Si02, V205/S'021 Zr02/S'02, and PbO/S'02 showed high activities and selectivities. M003/Si02 revealed the highest activity and selectivity for the transesterification. The yields of MPC and DPC based on phenol were 17.1 % 296 Z.-h. Fu, Y.

Reaction temperature = 433 K, DMC/PhOH = 5.0, PhOH = 23.8 mmol. and 0.2%, respectively, while only trace amount of anisole was observed as a by-product. A very small yield of DPC is due to the thermodynamic limitation. 3.1.2. Effect of supports Table 4 shows the effect of supports on the catalytic activity of M003 at 433 K. The unsupported M003 catalyst showed a very low activity probably because of the low surface area (7 m2/g). When M003 was supported on Si02, Zr02 and Ti02, higher MPC yields were obtained. When M003 was supported on Si02A1203, A1203 and CaO, MPC yields were quite low with high yields of anisole. In these cases, high yields of anisole are plausibly due to the Catalyst Table 2 The catalytic activities of metal acetate supported on silica for transesterification of dimethyl carbonate with phenol Phenol conversion (%) Yields (%) MPC DPC AN Mg(OAc)2 Ca(OAc)2 Y(OAc)3 La(OAc)3 Sm(OAc)3 Pr(OAc)3 Nd(OAc)2 17.3 13.6 14.6 14.2 17.2 16.4 15.9 8.1 0.2 9.4 0.1 11.5 0.1 9.9 0.1 13.7 0.1 8.5 0.1 11.6 0.1 8.9 4.1 3.0 4.1 3.3 7.5 4.2 MPC: methyl phenyl carbonate, DPC: diphenyl carbonate, AN: anisole.

It was confirmed by XRD that the oxide on the silica surface actually exists in the form of MoO3. 3.1.4. Effect of catalyst amount on the MPC yield Fig. 2 shows the effect of the amount of Mo03/Si02 catalyst at 433 K and 4.0 h. The loading amount of M003 on S'02 was 10 wt%. Increasing Mo03/Si02 weight from 0.005 g to 0.02 g led to the increase in a MPC yield. Above 0.03 g, the yield increased very slowly with increasing Mo03/Si02 weight. With 0.2 g of the catalyst, the yield of MPC reached 17.10. This value is probably very close to the equilibrium yield obtained by thermodynamic estimation at this temperature. In any case, the formation of anisole was not observed. 3.1.5. Effect of the temperature on the MPC yield The effect of temperature on the activities of Mo03/Si02 (0.03 g) was examined. The other reaction conditions were same as the one given in Table 4. At 433 K and 4.0 h, the MPC and DPC yields were 13.8% and 0.20, respectively. 298 Z.-h. Fu, Y. Ono /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 118 (1997) 293-299 When the reaction was conducted at 473 K for 8.0 h, MPC and DPC yields were 17.6% and 1.5%, respectively, but anisole was formed at a yield of 1.5%. Therefore, to avoid the formation of anisole as a by-product, the favorable temperature was around 430 K. 3.1.6. Reaction mechanism Since the acid or base catalysts do not give MPC from DMC and phenol, the coordination of a reactant/s to the coordinatively unsaturated molybdenum species seems essential for the transesterification. The tentative mechanism may be expressed as follows: \\ /Mo\\ - MeOCOPh O - MeOH MeO~ O~Me C /H + MeO00Me + PhOH \\ Oi H M A phenol molecule dissociatively adsorbs to coordinate to the surface molybdenum. A DMC molecule, a polar molecule, interacts with adsorbed phenoxide to form the transesterification product. 3.2. Disproportionation of MPC into DPC and DMC 3.2.1. Activities of Si02 supported catalysts Disproportionation of MPC into DPC and DMC [Eq. (3)] was studied, using M003/Si02 as the catalyst in an autoclave. As shown in Table 5, M003/Si02 catalyzed the disproportionation of MPC as well as the transesterifica- Table 5 The catalytic activities of supported M003 for the disproportionation of methyl phenyl carbonate (MPC) Catalyst Temperature Time (K) (h) M003 /Si02 433 433 473 473 M002 /Si02 433 M003 /Z03 433 Y(OAC)3 433 4 7 4 7 4 4 4 MPC Yields (%) conversion DPC AN 44.2 48.2 48.7 51.3 13.8 23.1 36.7 44.2 0.0 48.2 0.0 48.6 0.1 51.0 0.2 13.8 0.0 12.3 10.5 33.6 3.1 DPC: diphenyl carbonate, AN: anisole. Catalyst = 0.2 g, MPC 38.7 mmol. tion (Eq. (2)). The yields given in Table 5 were based on the phenyl group. Over 20 wt% Mo03/Si02, the conversions of MPC at 433 K in 4 h and 7 h were 44.1 % and 48.2%, respectively, and DPC and DMC were formed with a molar ratio of 1.0. The formation of anisole as a by-product was not observed at 433 K. The MPC conversions at 473 K in 4 h and 7 h were 48.7% and 51.3%, respectively. At this temperature, the selectivity for DPC formation was slightly lower than 100% because of the formation of a small amount of anisole. The equilibrium conversions of MPC are 49% and 51 % at 433 K and 473 K, respectively. Therefore, the disproportionation proceeds to the equilibrium under the experimental conditions. When a Mo03/Si02 catalyst was reduced with hydrogen, the formation of Mo02 was confirmed by XRD. In the presence of Mo02/Si02, the MPC conversion was much lower (13%), indicating that Mo03 is an active component, and that MoOz has much lower activity for the disproportionation. When Mo03 was supported on z03, the activity was much lower than Mo03/Si02 and an appreciable amount of anisole was formed, as in the case of the transesterification. The result with Y(OAc)3/Si02, which showed a high activity for the transesterification Z.-h. Fu, Y.

Effect of Mo03 loading on SiDZ The effect of Mo03 loading on a SiOz support is shown in Table 6. The sample of 20 wt% loading showed the highest activity, which was consistent with the results of transesterification of phenol with DMC. At every Mo03 loading, anisole was not formed. Thus, the favorable MoO 3 content was around 20 wt%. 3.2.3. Regeneration of the used catalyst When the reaction was carried out at 433 K for 4.0 h, the MPC conversion was 44.2%. After the reaction, the catalyst was separated by filtration and calcined at 823 K. Then, the reaction was carried out with the regenerated catalyst. The MPC conversion was 39.7%, indicating that the catalyst is basically regenerable. 3.2.4. Disproportionation with distillation Since the disproportionation of MPC is an equilibrium process, the DPC yield can be increased by removing DMC from the system during the reaction. The reaction was carried out under the atmospheric pressure in the distillation apparatus, where DMC could be distilled off. A 66% MPC conversion was obtained at 463 K in 8.0 h. 299 4. Conclusions Mo03/Si02 showed a high activity and se- lectivity for the transesterification of DMC with phenol as well as the disproportionation of MPC into DPC and DMC. In the transesterification, the yields of methyl phenyl carbonate and diphenyl carbonate were 17.1 % and 0.20, respectively, in 4 h at 433 K. In the disproportionation, the conversion reached 48.2% in 7 h at 433 K. These values are very close to those at equilibrium estimated from the thermodynamics. References [1] W.F.

Fax: +81-3-57342878. The transesterification of dimethyl carbonate with phenol to produce methyl phenyl carbonate was carried out in an autoclave using a variety of solid catalysts. MoO 3 SiO2 was found to have a very high activity for this transesterification. Thus, a 17.1% yield of methyl phenyl carbonate based on phenol was obtained at 433 K in the presence of MoO 3 SiO2 . MoO 3 SiO2 was also an active catalyst for the disproportionation of methyl phenyl carbonate into diphenyl carbonate and dimethyl carbonate. A 48% yield of diphenyl carbonate was attained over MoO 3 SiO2 at 443 K. These yield values are probably very close to those at the thermodynamic equilibrium.
