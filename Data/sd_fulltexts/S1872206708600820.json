DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(08)60082-0 Catalytic Decomposition of Ozone in Ground Air by Manganese-Based Monolith Catalysts YU Quanwei, ZHAO Ming, LIU Zhimin, ZHANG Xiaoyu, ZHENG Lingmin, CHEN Yaoqiang, GONG Maochu* Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry and Technology, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, China Abstract: A highly active manganese dioxide material with deficient oxygen atoms (MnO x , x = 1.6–2.0) was prepared by calcining man- ganese carbonate, and a SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 support with large surface area was prepared by the peptizing method. A series of Pd-MnO x /SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 catalysts for ozone (O 3 ) decomposition with different MnO x contents were prepared by incipient wet impregnation and characterized by activity tests, N 2 adsorption, and life tests. The results of activity tests indicated that catalytic performance increased with MnO x content, but the MnO x catalyst without the support fell off easily and its catalytic performance decreased. At gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) = 360000 h 1 , the complete conversion temperature (T 100 ) on the Pd-MnO x /SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 catalyst with 80% MnO x content was 30 °C. At GHSV = 660000 h 1 , the catalysts with 80%–90% MnO x had the best performance with T 100 = 45–50 °C. Touching temperature between air and the water tank of an automobile was satisfied in this temperature range. At 45 °C and GHSV = 510000 h 1 , O 3 conversion on the catalyst with 80% MnO x still kept better standard (>90%), which indicates that the catalyst had very high capacity to resist deactivation after 95 h of life test. Key words: ozone; manganese dioxide with deficient oxygen atom; palladium; catalytic decomposition; monolith catalyst Exhaust emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides can form photochemical smog in sunlight and generate O 3 on the ground. It is well known that the O 3 layer over the Earth’s atmosphere blocks ultraviolet light and plays a crucial role in protecting life on the Earth. However, when the ground con- centration of O 3 is above 0.1 × 10 6 , people can feel ill, and when exposed to a high O 3 concentration for a long time, peo- ple can get cancer and suffer death [1]. Therefore, it is neces- sary to reduce ground O 3 and protect human life. O 3 is very unstable. Two O 3 molecules decompose into three O 2 molecules, and the rate of decomposition is increased with increased temperature. Terui et al. [2] used palladium and MnO x as the active components with added Al 2 O 3 sol and loaded them on TiO 2 -SiO 2 honeycomb supports. The catalyst was used in a 20 h test. The O 3 conversion rate was 55%–80%. They also examined manganese carbonate (MnCO 3 ) powder calcined at a specific temperature to produce MnO x (x = 1.6–2.0) [3]. Hoke et al. [4] loaded Pd and Pt on supports with high surface area and coated these catalysts on wave-shaped heat patches of automobile water tanks. When cars were run at high speed, the water tanks used the waste heat of their surface (surface temperature was 45–105 o C) to treat ground O 3 . Later they [5] used potassium permanganate and manganese acetate to prepare MnO x (x = 1.6–2.0) by a redox method. The PremAir catalyst from Engelhard Corporation was used on automobile water tanks, and the O 3 conversion rate was about 80% [6]. High concentration O 3 removal at low GHSV has been exten- sively studied in China. For example, Au/Fe 2 O 3 catalysts were prepared to catalyze the decomposition of high concentration O 3 by Hao et al. [7] at room temperature. Yang et al. [8,9] used a Au/TiO 2 catalyst for the photocatalytic decomposition of air O 3 . The experimental results showed that at low RH, MnO 2 as a single metal oxide has the best capacity to treat O 3 [10], but at high RH water molecules and O 3 molecules adsorbed com- YU Quanwei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(1): 1–3 petitively on the catalyst surface, the pores got blocked, and the activity of MnO x became poor. Pd can resist water and slow down the activity reduction of the catalyst [11–13]. This paper reports the preparation of Pd and MnO x together on the SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 support to perform O 3 decomposition in air at the water tank temperature of a car running at high speed. SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 was prepared by the peptizing method. After spraying, drying, and calcination for 4 h at 600 o C, the SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 support was obtained (surface area = 199 m 2 /g). MnO x was prepared by calcining MnCO 3 solid at 350 °C for 2 h [3] under aerobic conditions. The catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness im- pregnation method. Palladium nitrate solution was divided into two parts in a 2:1 volume ratio and dipped into MnO x and SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 support, respectively. Then by mixing these pow- ders, a slurry was obtained. This was coated on three cordierite ceramic honeycomb substrates with volumes of 0.28, 0.37, and 0.52 cm 3 . After drying and calcination for 2 h at 500 o C, Pd-MnO x /SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 catalysts with MnO x contents of 20%, 35%, 50%, 65%, 80%, 85%, 90%, and 100% were obtained. These catalysts had a coating of 250–280 g/L on the cordierite substrates, and the Pd/Mn atomic ratio was 1:100. In addition, the MnO x / SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 catalyst with 80% MnO x was prepared in the same way by mixing MnO x and the SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 support. The simulation device was composed of an air compressor, JY-3 O 3 generator, catalytic reactor, and M4+ model O 3 Ana- lyzer. The gas flow in the equipment was 3.15 L/min. Activity tests were performed over the catalysts with dif- ferent MnO x contents. Using an O 3 concentration at the en- trance of (5.8 ± 0.2) × 10 7 (volume fraction, 30 °C) and RH of 55%–65% (25–30 o C). The temperature when there was 100% conversion of O 3 was defined as the complete conversion temperature (T 100 ). The catalysts with MnO x contents of 20%, 35%, 50%, 65%, 80%, and 100% were measured at GHSV = 360000 h 1 . The activity of these catalysts all increased with increasing tem- perature. The conversions at 30 o C were 75.8%, 82.7%, 91.4%, 96.5%, 100%, and 62%, respectively. The T 100 of them were 37, 36, 34, 31, 30, and 42 o C, respectively. These results showed that the MnO x content was crucial for catalytic activity. The T 100 of the catalyst with 80% MnO x was the lowest (30 °C). However, because the catalyst with 100% MnO x did not adhere well to cordierite and was lost easily, it had reduced activity. Therefore, the catalyst with 80% MnO x had the best activity. Adding a SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 support to the catalysts contributed to the dispersion and adhesion of the active MnO x component. In order to find the best value for MnO x content, three catalysts with MnO x contents of 80%, 85%, and 90% were characterized by an activity test at GHSV = 660000 h 1 (other test conditions as above). The results in Fig. 1 show that T 100 is nearly the same and in the range of 45 to 50 °C. The catalysts with MnO x contents of 80%–90% had the best activity. For the Pd-MnO x /SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 and MnO x /SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 cata- lysts with the same MnO x content (80%), the activity test re- sults at a GHSV of 660000 h 1 (other test conditions as above) showed that their T 100 were 46 and 48 °C, respectively. This indicates that MnO x is the important active component that decomposes O 3 . The loading of Pd contributed to improve activity by water resistance. The influence of GHSV on the conversion rate over the catalyst with 80% MnO x is shown in Fig. 2. T 100 of the three GHSV points are 30, 36, and 46 °C, respectively. The O 3 conversion rate decreased with increasing GHSV. With in- creasing GHSV, the O 3 molecule contacted with the catalyst surface for a shorter time, and it became more difficult to treat O 3 , but the increasing temperature contributed to the decom- position of O 3 .

YU Quanwei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(1): 1–3 At GHSV = 510000 h 1 and 45 o C, the O 3 conversion over the catalyst with 80% MnO x was still as high as 91%. This indicates the very strong resistance to deactivation of this catalyst after a 95 h life test � The catalysts were characterized using an automatic ZXF-5-N 2 adsorption instrument (Northwest Research Institute of Chemical Engineering, China). The results are shown in Table 1. With increasing MnO x content, the surface area de- creased after an initial increase, and the pore volume decreased after showing no change initially. The MnO x content played an important role in the decomposition of O 3 . The GHSV of the test gas was very high such that O 3 molecules cannot get into the inner pores of the catalysts and reach the active sites inside. O 3 molecules were mainly adsorbed for their decomposition on the active sites of the external surface of the catalyst. The larger the MnO x content, the more MnO x particles on the external surface of the catalyst, giving more active sites outside. Thus, the activity of catalyst became higher. For five catalysts with MnO x contents of 50%, 65%, 80%, 90%, and 100%, XPS results indicated that there was mainly MnO 2 with deficient oxygen atoms on the surface of the cata- lysts. The Mn surface contents of the catalysts were 19.92%, 32.3%, 37.99%, 37.66%, and 55.82%, respectively. With in- creasing MnO x content, the MnO x surface content and surface active site number also increased, so catalytic activity in- creased. At the same time, because the SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 support content was too small, the surface area of the catalyst and surface active site became small, so catalytic performance decreased. The MnO x catalyst without the support was de- tached easily, the total surface active site became small, and catalytic performance decreased too. Under the same condi- tions, the surface active site of the catalysts with MnO x content of 80%–90% maintained a good balance; therefore, their ac- tivity was the best. In conclusion, the Pd-MnO x /SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 catalysts can de- compose O 3 effectively under low temperature conditions. The MnO x content decides the catalytic activity. The catalysts with MnO x content of 80%–90% have the best performance. Fur- thermore, they can withstand the contact temperature between air and the water tank when a car is running. The catalysts have a strong resistance to deactivation. This series of catalysts can be used for the reduction of ground O 3 . References [1] Subrahmanyam C, Bulushev D A, Kiwi-Minsker L.
