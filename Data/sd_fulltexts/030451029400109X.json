Introduction Many processes have been proposed for the non-biological reduction of COZ involving heterogeneous catalysis and electrochemical reaction. However, most of the non-biological reactions need such extreme conditions as high temperature or high overpotential. In such conversion processes, it is very important to apply a low energy since there is the possibility of secondary generation of COZ if the required energy is supplied by using a fossil fuel. The choice of hydrogen source is another important problem In the methanation of CO2 (Sabatier reaction) [ 1 ], hydrogen gas is used at elevated temperature The preparation of hydrogen gas requires high energy if it is produced by electrolysis or steam-reforming process. * Corresponding author 0304-5102/94/$07 00 1994 Elsevier Science B V All rights reserved SSDl0304-5102(94)00109-9 270 H Uchida et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 93 (1994) 269-277 Most desirable energy and hydrogen sources are sunlight and H20, respectively In light of this, we have studied the photoreduction of C02 over Ni0/Si02 [2], Ce02 /T102 [ 3 ] , or Fe /T102 [ 4,5 ] catalyst. In the present study, the reduction of C02 to oxygen-containing species was accomplished by the redox reaction with Prussian blue-deposited T102 In dark, and the catalyst was reactivated under the irradiation of light 2. Experimental Rutile T102 particles were supplied from Kojundo Kagaku (sample A) and Chitan Kogyo (sample B) Co. The purity of sample A was 99 7%, and sample B of 98 6% purity contained 0 43% Nb2059 0 18 K20, 0 06 A1203, 015 P205, 0 03 S03, 0 01 CaO and 0 26 H20 The deposition of Prussian blue (PB) was performed according to the method described by Tada et al [6] 100 mg of sample A or B was put in a glass tube containing an equimolar mixed solution of 5 ml of 0.02 mol dm -3 ( =M) FeC13 6H20 and 5 ml of 0 02 M K3Fe(CN)6 The suspension was bubbled with Ar for 30 min, and irradiated under magnetic stirring with a 500 W Xe lamp The suspension was centrifuged to separate the PB-deposited T102 The particles were thoroughly washed with distilled water and dried in air at 60 C. A dilute HCl solution was added to the P13-deposited particles, and Fe (CN) 6 ` and Fe 3+ remaining in the PB were filtered off The final PB/T102 particles were again 5 6 [~ [713 4 2 Fig 1 Schematic diagram of photolysis system 1, N2, 2, CO2, 3, circulating pump, 4, liquid nitrogen trap, 5, photolysis cell, 6, thermocouple, 7, catalyst, 8, water trap, 9, ice, 10, manometer, 11, vacuum, 12, 500 W Xe lamp, 13, prism H Uchida et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 93 (1994) 269-277 271 washed with distilled water and dried in air Spectral reflectance of the T102 and P13-deposited T102 was measured with a Shimadzu UV 2200 spectrometer for wavelengths between 190 and 900 rim An integrating sphere reflectometer was used to measure the hemispherical-directional reflectance The X-ray diffraction spectrum was measured by using a X-ray spectrometer (Rigaku Denki Co.) with CuKa radiation The apparatus used was a closed circulating system as shown m Fig 1 A photolysis cell was constructed in a vacuum line, and 0 5 g of the prepared catalyst was placed at the bottom of the cell (total volume, 1 5 dm3) Light was shone from the bottom via a rectangular quartz prism A 500 W xenon lamp served as the light source. After the reaction cell was evacuated for 30 min, C02 (760 Torr) was admitted C02 (Iwatani Co, 99 7% purity) was purified by repeated freeze-pump-thaw cycles During the photolysis, the reaction gas was circulated at a rate of 0.2 dm3 min-1, and the products were trapped with cold water, 10 cm3 ( -2 C) The trapped products were analysed with an Ohkura SSC-1 steam chromatograph with a flame ionization detector and a Porapak R column and a Hitachi 655A high performance liquid chromatograph with a UV monitor and a GL-C61 OH column A GC-8AIF gas chromatograph with a Porapak Q column was used to analyse gaseous product 3. Results and discussion The photodeposition of PB onto T102 in the aqueous ferric-ferricyanide solution was accompanied with the evolution of oxygen gas, as observed by Tada et al. [ 6] Hence, as suggested schematically in Fig 2, the ferric and ferricyanide ions are reduced by the reaction with the electrons photogenerated in the T102 conduction band and the holes in the valence band are consumed to oxidize H20 Although Tada et al have claimed that the formation of PB is the only reduction reaction, by h+ 02 Fe 3'+K'+Fe(CN)63_ Fe4nt[Fett(CN)6]3 (PB) `K4Fe4tt[Fett(CN)ols (ES) Fig 2 Representation of the photodepositton of PB and ES onto Tt02 particles 272 H Uchida et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 93 (1994) 269-277 1 L - 1.k 'AAA A - A.1, A- - 10 30 50 70 90 20 / deg II I ~1~1 ~ I ~li ~ i ~~ I PB-deposited Ti02 TiFe(CN)62H20 III 1 11 11 1 1- .11 , .11 Ti02 I I I , I I I , , I ~ , , , Fe4(Fe(CN)6)3 Fig 3 X-ray diffraction spectrum of PB-deposited Ti02, and XRD patterns of TiFe(CN)6 2H20, Ti02 and Fe4(Fe(CN)6)3 PB was here suggested to be further reduced to ES (Eventt's salt, reduced form of PB) as described below X-ray diffraction spectrum of PB-deposited Ti02 is shown along with those of TiFe (CN) 6 2H20, Ti02 and Fe3 (Fe (CN) 6) 3 (PB) m Fig 3 The XRD pattern of the PB-deposited Ti02 is given by superposing those of Ti02 and PB However, a close look at these spectra reveals that no peak appears at 2O=4 7 4 9 and 30 m the latter two patterns, suggesting strongly that the deposits involve not only PB but also further reduced forms of PB The reduction of PB is given by [ 7 ] Fe4I[Fe'I(CN) 6]3+4K++4e--K4Fe4[FeII(CN)6]3 (1) (PB) (ES) As described later, the reduction of C02 is induced by the oxidation of ES to PB m dark, and the rereducrion of PB to ES can be accomplished under the irradiation of light In Fig 4, the absorption spectra of Ti02 (sample A) and PB-deposited Ti02 are shown The threshold wavelength of absorption for Ti02 is 378 rim, corresponding to the bandgap of 3 2 eV m agreement with the value given m the literature [ 8 ] The PB/T102 particles have a large absorption band m the visible region, due to the intense blue color of PB Eventt's salt, which was suggested above to be included in the deposits, is colorless, and the increase of the ES concentration m the deposits should result m the decrease of the absorbance m the visible region H Uchida et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 269-277 273 1 :I I I r I I i I r' I / I x12 b ccs I 200 400 600 800 ~ / rim Fig 4 Absorption spectra of (a) T10z (sample A) and (b) PB/TiOz particles originated from sample A The products obtained in the photoreductlon over PB-deposited T102 (sample A) and T102 (sample B) are shown in Table 1 and 2, respectively In both cases, the products were methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde and acetone Gaseous product such as methane was negligibly small It is noted that CZ and C3 compounds were generated from COZ under the illumination of light having almost no ultraviolet since the light from the Xe lamp was irradiated from the outside of the Pyrex cell Also, it is interesting that the amount of products was always larger in dark than under illumination In Fig 5, the absorption spectrum of the PB /T102 particles after reaction in dark is shown along with that before reaction As seen from this figure, the absorbance increases in the visible region after reaction, implying that the concentration of PB was increased Hence, there is no doubt that the oxidation reaction of ES to PB occurs during the reaction, causing the reduction of CO2 The hydrogen source is Table 1 Results obtained m the photoreduchon of COZ over PB-deposited TIOz (sample A)a Run Gas Light/Dark Time Products/lr,mol dm-3 I We CH30H CZHSOH CH3CHO (CH3)ZCO 1 CO2 light 3 0 6 1 2 0 5 2 6 11 8 2 CO2 dark 3 0 6 1 8 0 6 2 1 11 7 3 CO2 light 6 1 0 2 1 0 6 2 2 13 0 4 CO2 dark 6 0 6 3 0 1 0 3 3 18 5 5 At light 6 0 3 0 5 0 3 0 4 3 1 6 CO2 light 12 2 7 2 4 0 9 2 0 15 3 7 CO2 dark 12 1 0 4 5 1 9 5 4 30 0 8 CO2 light 24 1 9 4 1 14 3 6 23 7 9 CO2 dark 24 1 7 5 6 4 0 6 7 41 0 'Volume of water trap, 10 ml, amount of catalyst used, 0 5 g, reaction temperature, 25 C b Total concentration of the products on the bass of C content (N,mol dm-3) 274 H Uchida et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 269-277 Table 2 Results obtained m the photoreductnon of COz over PB-deposited Ti02 (sample B)a Run Gas Light/Dark Time Products/P,mol dm-' _VC CH30H C2H50H CH3CHO (CH3) ZCO 1 CO2 light 3 0 6 1 2 0 5 2 0 10 0 2 CO2 dark 3 0 9 4 1 0 9 3 1 20 2 3 CO2 light 6 1 4 2 4 1 1 2 2 14 8 4 CO2 dark 6 1 3 4 2 1 0 3 0 20 7 5 At light 6 03 06 02 03 28 6 CO2 light 12 1 0 2 4 0 6 2 8 15 4 7 CO2 dark 12 1 6 9 3 1 2 7 3 44 5 8 CO2 light 24 1 4 2 4 0 8 4 9 22 5 9 CO2 dark 24 2 4 9 1 2 5 10 2 56 2 'Volume of water trap, 10 n-l, amount of catalyst used 0 5 g, reaction temperature, 25 C Total concentration of the products on the bass of C content (1,mol dm-3) the water corresponding to vapor pressure at 25 C In the reaction system.

In Fig 8, the absorption spectra of the PB /Ti02 particles before and after reaction under illumination are shown along with that of the particles which were again photolyzed in KCl aqueous solution saturated with Ar after used for the reduction of CO2 This figure suggests that the PB formed during the reduction of CO2 was photorereduced to ES, i e , the deactivated catalyst can be photochemically restored Furthermore, a comparison of this figure with Fig 5 shows that the difference of absorbance m the visible region before and after reaction was larger under illumination than in the dark although the reduction of CO2 was less favorable under light. Hence, the oxidation of ES is considered to be brought about by the scavenging of the photogenerated holes in addition to the reduction of CO2 by Ti02 ~ Ti02(eCB + hvB) (6) ES+hvB->PB+K+ (7) The involvement of the excited electrons in the reduction of H20 to Hads seems to be inessential considering the fact that the reduction of CO2 was less expedient under light The electrons are probably consumed by the recombination with hvB and/or the trapping reaction by impurities 4. Conclusion The catalytic reduction of C02 was performed over Prussian blue-deposited Ti02 particles in the vapor pressure of water at 25 C The reduction products were H Uchida et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 269-277 277 oxygen-containing species including methanol, ethanol and acetone. PB was photodeposited onto T102 particles in KCl aqueous solution, and a portion of PB was further photoreduced to ES The probable reaction scheme was the stepwise hydrogenation of COZ by the reaction with active hydrogen atoms generated in the redox reaction involving the oxidation of ES to PB and the reduction of H20 The deactivated particles could be restored under the irradiation with light in KCl solution References [ 1 ] P J Lunde and F L Kester, J Catal , 30 (1973) 423 [2] K Ogura, M Kawano and D Adachr, J Mol Catal, 72 (1992) 173 [3] K Ogura, M Kawano, J Yano and Y Sakata, J Photochem Photobrol , 66 (1992) 91 [4] K Ogura, A Seno and M Kawano, J Mol Catal , 73 (1992) 255 [5] K Ogura, T Koreislu, J Yano and K Mme, J Mol Catal, 79 (1993) 47 [ 6 ] H Tada, Y Saito and H Kawahara, J Electrochem Soc, 138 (1991) 140 [ 7 ] K Itaya, H Akahoshr and S Toshrma, J Electrochem Soc, 129 (1982) 1498 [ 8 ] S Roy Momson, Electrochermstry at Semiconductor and Oxide Metal Electrodes, Plenum, New York, 1980, p 183 [9 ] K Ogura, H Sugrhara, J Yano and M Hrgasa,1 Electrochem Soc , 141 (1994) 419 [ 10] K R Thampr, J Kiwi and M Gratzel, Nature, 327 (1987) 506 X244 9400109X 0304-5102(94)00109-X 10.1016/0304-5102(94)00109-X Dark catalytic reduction of CO2 over Prussian blue-deposited TiO2 and the photo-reactivation of the catalyst H.
