Graphical abstract Electrochemical water splitting could be an efficient alternative route for clean and renewable energy storage. However, widespread application of this technique is hindered by the high overpotential required for the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this contribution, we report that novel N based conducting polymers exhibit excellent charge transfer properties with earth abundant transition metals. A strong interaction between Ni and N from polypyrrole (PPy) was identified via XPS, resulting in higher amounts of Niδ++ sites at the interface. Electronegative N from PPy shell, covering Ni12P5 microspheres, interacts with Ni on the inner edge and electrodeposited Co on the outer edge, establishing a dual synergic effect. This hybrid catalyst, with Co-N and Ni-N active interfaces, demonstrates faster OER kinetics owing to improved electrophilicity towards hydroxyl ions. With dual M-N sites, Co@Ni12P5/PPy displays a low Tafel slope of 40 mV/dec and stability up to 7 h of electrochemical cycling. This work enables discovery of a new class of anode materials based on metal-PPy analogs for alkaline OER. Keywords Metal phosphides Microspheres Polypyrrole Synergic effect M-N Oxygen evolution reaction 1 Introduction Energy production via hydrogen using electrochemical water splitting is an emerging technology in clean and renewable conversion. The anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the primary concern for practical feasibility of alkaline water electrolyzers. Oxygen evolution requires a large overpotential due to the formation of high energy intermediates [1]. As a result, development of efficient catalysts is required to improve the reaction kinetics and performance. Even noble metal-based catalysts (Ru/Ir), that have been benchmarked as state of the art materials, require overpotential > 0.25 V (η10) to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm2 per geometric surface area [2]. In addition, these elements are expensive, and not sufficiently abundant to meet future energy application needs. Recent research has seen development of robust catalysts such as alloys of Pt group metals, transition metal oxides, nitrides, chalcogenides, or phosphides. However, many of these catalysts still exhibit high overpotential. Hence, design of new earth abundant catalysts to overcome the high overpotential has been a primary focus for improvement. Transition metal (TM) catalysts, especially Mn, Fe, Co and Ni based, have shown performance at par with the state of the art electrocatalysts, in terms of specific activity normalized to geometric area [3,4]. In particular, TM phosphides (TMPs) have received considerable attention towards OER owing to their stability in electrolysis potential range. Among all TMPs, nickel phosphide is a remarkable catalyst with excellent stability and multiple stoichiometries: Ni3P [5], Ni12P5, Ni2P [6], Ni5P4 [7], which are all highly active in water splitting reactions. Recently, Menezes et al. reported that Ni12P5 shows better activity for OER due to excess stoichiometric Ni, resulting in higher density of active metal sites [8]. Conventional TMPs exhibit lower activity compared to bimetallic phosphides due to change in energy for chemisorption of intermediates at the active site [9]. Recently, Mendoza-Garcia et al. reported a new bimetallic Co(2-x)FexP catalyst that showed enhanced electrochemical performance compared to Co2P or Fe2P due to alloying effect [10]. A similar result was reported by Li et al. using 3D NiCoP on Ni foam [11]. For most of these catalysts, research has demonstrated the dependence of OER performance on its affinity for OH– chemisorption. To enhance this effect, we direct our efforts to tune the electrophilicity of metal site via surface modification using conducting polymers. Conducting polymers (CP) such as polypyrrole (PPy), polyaniline (PANI) and polythiophenes (PTh) have received significant attention due to their excellent properties and potential applications in catalysis [12,13]. Among these, PPy is one of the most studied CP due to its high conductivity, ease of synthesis, biocompatibility, chemical stability, as well as its entangled structure and high surface area [14,15]. Moreover, PPy has nitrogen as a heteroatom, which can form M−N bonds with different materials resulting in enhanced electrocatalytic activity [16]. Integrating an electronegative N at the cationic Ni site can affect the electronic state of Ni resulting in stable higher oxidation states. Cao et al. modified the surface of MnCo2O4 with PPy by in situ chemical polymerization of excess pyrrole with H2O2 (10 wt%) [17]. They found that PPy layer on MnCo2O4 surface provides a conductive network for fast electron transfer resulting in enhanced electrocatalytic activities for both ORR and OER. Jia et al. demonstrated enhanced bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis in ternary CoNiMn-LDH/PPy/RGO composite. Synergy among its three different constituents, highlight the charge transfer properties of conjugated PPy in overall electrocatalytic performance of the composites [18]. In this work, we present a novel hybrid catalyst comprised of Co decorated Ni12P5/PPy core–shell microspheres and evaluate their performance in OER. We strategically tailored the electronic properties of two different metals by functionalizing with a conducting polymer. A M−N center acts as an excellent active site for OER due to accelerated charge transfer rate between layers. It is expected that this synergic interaction (M−N) modulates the electron density around the metal atom by inducing charge redistribution resulting in altered binding energies of hydroxide or intermediate ions at the active site. As a result, a dual synergic effect was obtained, Co-N and Ni-N, when Co is anchored on the PPy shell covering Ni12P5. Simultaneous integration of excellent conducting properties with efficient catalytically active sites (M−N) is demonstrated to be the key for highly enhanced electrochemical OER activity. Understanding the properties of surface functionalization in Co@Ni12P5/PPy can pave way for new metal based PPy analogs with immense potential in oxygen electrocatalysis. 2 Experimental methods: 2.1 Materials All chemicals were utilized without any further purification. NiCl2·6H2O (Sigma Aldrich 99.999%), CoCl2·6H2O (Sigma Aldrich ≥ 98%), NaH2PO2·H2O (Sigma Aldrich ≥ 99%), anhydrous FeCl3 (Sigma Aldrich ≥ 99.99%), Pyrrole (Sigma Aldrich 98%), LiClO4 (Sigma Aldrich ≥ 99.99%). Schematic representation of the three steps used to synthesize hybrid catalyst is shown in Scheme 1 . 2.2 Preparation of Ni12P5 microspheres Ni12P5 microspheres were synthesized using a procedure developed by Ni et al. [19]. In short, this technique uses excess CoCl2 as a template along with Ni and P precursors in deionized water (DW). The contents were transferred to a Teflon autoclave and heated at 170 °C for 10 h. The resulting precipitate was washed several times with DW and ethanol to completely remove Co ions. Finally, the microspheres were dried at 60 °C overnight. 2.3 Preparation of Ni12P5/PPy composite Ni12P5/PPy composite was prepared via oxidative chemical polymerization. Typically, 60 mg of Ni12P5 and 30 µL of pyrrole were dispersed in 6 mL DW and sonicated for 30 min to obtain a good dispersion. In a separate flask, 70.2 mg FeCl3 was dissolved in 6 mL DW. Then, the FeCl3 solution was added to the monomer solution slowly under continuous stirring. The final solution was refluxed at room temperature overnight. The product was obtained by centrifugation and then washed several times with DW. Finally, the obtained Ni12P5/PPy composite was dried at 60 °C for 24 h. 2.4 Electrodeposition of Co on Ni12P5/PPy Deposition of cobalt on Ni12P5@PPy composite was performed in aqueous solution containing 0.05 M CoCl2 with 0.1 M LiClO4 as supporting electrolyte. The deposition was achieved under chronoamperometric conditions at a potential of −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 30 s on glassy carbon electrode coated with Ni12P5@PPy. Deposition time was optimized after several trials. After deposition of Co, the electrode was rinsed with DW and dried in air. Other control studies include Co electrodeposition, using the same procedure, on bare, PPy and Ni12P5 coated glassy carbon electrode. 2.5 Characterization of materials The phase and structure of Ni12P5 and Ni12P5/PPy were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) (Bruker/D8 Advance) using Cu anode target (λ = 1.5418 Å). Infrared spectrocopic (IR) analysis was performed using Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 spectrophotometer with a built-in ATR (Attenuated total reflection). By placing powders directly on the diamond crystal surface, spectra were collected with a resolution of 0.241 cm−1 and 100 scans. Analysis of morphology and composition was done by scanning electron microscopy - energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) using Hitachi S-800 electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 25 kV at 15 mm working distance. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) Tecnai F20 was used with a point resolution of 0.24 nm for detailed morphological studies. Surface analysis was conducted using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) system. All data obtained were processed by shifting the reference C 1 s peak to 284.8 eV. 2.6 Electrochemical analysis A Gamry electrochemical workstation was used to study the electrocatalytic OER activity of all catalysts using a rotating disk electrode (RDE). Pt wire as counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference were employed. After every measurement, SCE was kept in distilled water and thorougly cleaned before storing in 4 M KCl. Electrode inks were prepared by sonicating 2.0 mg sample in 500 μL isopropanol, 500 μL distilled water and nafion (1 wt%; 10 μL) for 30 min. 10 μL of this ink was drop casted onto the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and dried in air. Prior to any electrochemical measurement, working electrode was cleaned thoroughly with 0.05 μm alumina and 1 M KOH electrolyte was purged for 20 min with ultra high pure N2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were done at 50 and 5 mV/s, respectively. Initial surface activation for all catalysts were done by performing repeated CV. Final activity is reported as current density, obtained by normalizing current to the geometric surface area of the electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were taken at a potential of 0.65 V vs SCE. Each catalysts were at least tested three times under same experimental conditions. Reference electrode calibration was performed in H2 purged 1 M KOH using Pt wires as working and counter electrodes [20,21]. Using SCE as reference, LSV was taken at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. The potential at 0 mA is taken as the thermodynamic potential for hydrogen electrode reactions (Figure S1). All potentials were converted to RHE using the equation: E (vs RHE) = E (vs SCE) + 1.004 V. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Formation of Ni12P5 core–shell structure A template based hydrothermal technique, using CoCl2, is employed for the synthesis of Ni12P5 with controlled morphology [19]. SEM images in Figure S2(a,d) display Ni12P5 microspheres of approximately 1 μm diameter. Complete dissolution of Co2+ precursors in the final product was confirmed using EDS analysis, as shown in Fig. 1 a. Absence of Co Kα at 6.9 eV highlights the composition of microspheres to consist of only Ni and P. EDS color mapping indicates the uniform distribution of Ni and P throughout the microspheres, as shown in Figure S2(b,c). These microspheres were modified to form a core shell Ni12P5/PPy composite by chemical polymerization of pyrrole. The phase and structure of the Ni12P5/PPy composite determined using PXRD presented a tetragonal space group - I4/m as shown in Fig. 1b. The broad lines indicate the presence of small crystallites of size ~ 9 nm, obtained using Scherrer equation. Diffraction pattern showed peaks corresponding to the following major lattice planes of Ni12P5: (130), (112), (321), (400), (330), (240) and (132). There is no crystallinity observed from PPy. Polymerization of Py around the microspheres was achieved using FeCl3 as an oxidant. Varying the oxidants can result in different electrical conductivity, specific surface area and porosity [22]. Sha et al. showed that the type of oxidant used in the preparation of PPy-based catalysts affected the catalytic activity of the resulting catalyst. The catalyst prepared using FeCl3 as an oxidant showed better electrocatalytic performance compared to using other oxidants including ammonium persulphate (APS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) [23]. While employing FeCl3 is essential for effective doping of the conducting polymer, its strong oxidizing nature can potentially distort the morphology and structure of the microspheres. Interestingly, the tetragonal phase as well as the spherical morphology remained intact in the composite confirming its robust nature. A core shell structure of Ni12P5/PPy, confirmed in Figure S2(e,f), shows a continuous envelope of the polymer on the microspheres. Fig. 1a also highlights the absence of Fe impurities in the catalyst after Py polymerization. Further confirmation of no accidental incorporation of Fe is explained in section 3.4. Introduction of PPy shell around the microspheres presents new vibrational peaks at 1559 and 1476 cm−1 indicating the asymmetric and symmetric ring stretching modes of PPy as shown in Figure S3 [24]. The peaks at 1298 and 1174 cm−1 correspond to the stretching of the C-N and C-H deformation vibrations of PPy [25]. Also, a characteristic peak at 1080 cm−1 , in both Ni12P5 as well as Ni12P5/PPy, corresponding to Ni-Pstr confirms the formation of a metal phosphide [26]. For precise morphological remarks, TEM images of the Ni12P5 microspheres are shown in Fig. 2 (a-c). HRTEM analysis reveals two exposed crystallographic planes corresponding to (240) and (112) of I4/m phase. The TEM images of the Ni12P5/PPy core shell structure given in Fig. 2(d-f) exhibit different stages of polymerization. Initially, an inconsistent thin layer of polymerization occurs at the surface of the Ni12P5 microspheres. Polymerization occurs selectively around the microspheres due to electrostatic interaction of Py monomer at the Ni12P5 surface prior to oxidation. The polymer chain spreads along the microsphere completely covering the surface. Through the process of aging, polypyrrole forms a uniform shell around Ni12P5. Inspite of this thick shell, HRTEM exposes (112) lattice plane of Ni12P5 emphasizing the amorphous nature of the polymer. 3.2 Electronic changes at Ni12P5/PPy interface Insights into understanding the role of the PPy shell can be obtained from change in chemical states of each element. Fig. 3 presents the XPS profiles for all elements revealing the possible interaction of PPy with the Ni12P5 core. Ni exhibits two peaks corresponding to the spin–orbit lines of 2p3/2. Metal phosphides have a strong tendency for surface oxidation leading to phosphates. Therefore, it is common for Ni in Ni12P5 to exist in mixed oxidation states i.e. + 2 (nickel phosphate or hydroxide) and a small positive + δ (0 < δ < 2) corresponding to 855.9 eV and 852.4 eV, respectively (Fig. 3a) [27]. The P 2p profile consists of two prominent peaks at 129.4 eV and 133 eV, corresponding to the formation of metal phosphide and metal phosphate, respectively (Fig. 3b). A negative shift in binding energy of characteristic peak for elemental P (typically at 130.2 eV) confirms the strong electronic interaction of Niδ+ to introduce slightly electronegative Pδ- . An increase in the relative intensity of phosphides is observed after polymer incorporation (Figure S4a). Appearance of characteristic C = N (288.1 eV) in C 1 s profile (Fig. 3c) of the composites confirm the successful introduction of the conjugated polymer shell. The C-C peak at 284.8 eV in Ni12P5 microspheres arises from the substrate used for analysis. C-OH or C = O (286.5 eV) peak could possibly arise from exposure to air after synthesis. O 1 s spectrum shows a strong peak which may possibly originate from both nickel hydroxide and/or phosphate. The adsorbed OH– or PO4 3- (Fig. 3d) arises due to surface oxidation. Although literature on metal phosphides discuss mostly surface phosphates due to exposure to air, XPS alone cannot effectively differentiate between these two phases due to similar binding energies [27-29]. There are no extra peaks in the O 1 s profile due to the introduction of PPy shell on the microspheres. XPS profile of N shows no peak for Ni12P5, as expected. However, N exists in three different coordination environment in the Ni12P5/PPy composites (Fig. 3e) i.e. = N- at 397.8 eV, undoped N-H center at 399.6 eV and doped +N-H center at 401.2 eV [30]. Figure S4c illustrates the structure of doped PPy shell. The peak for = N- points out the highly conjugated nature of the polymer and unlocalized electrons contributing to aromaticity of the monomer. The peak at 401.2 eV arises due to the uneven doping during polymerization, forming an electropositive N center with higher binding energy. The most intense peak arises due to large number of undoped N centers at slightly lower binding energy (399.6 eV). During polymerization, electronegative N in PPy display electrostatic interaction with metal ions at the surface. Recent report attributed this interaction to cause electronic changes at Coδ+ site in N-doped Co2P/CC, monitored by a positive 0.4 eV shift in Co 2p binding energy [31]. Strong electrophilicity of N urges electron transfer from metal to N creating a highly positive metal center. A similar observation was reported by Yao et al. in N-CoS2, creating synergic Co-N sites with enhanced catalytic properties [32]. Work done by Wang et al. demonstrated formation of M−N coordination bond during encapsulation of PPy on MnCo2O4 nanobelts [33]. Increased amounts of Co3+ and Mn3+ were credited to strong oxidizing environment during polymerization and/or interaction between metal and N from PPy. In this work, the probable Ni-N interaction was confirmed by evaluating the relative intensities and peak position of Ni (2p) in both the microspheres and core–shell composites. As evidenced in Fig. 3f, after composite formation, overall increase in atomic percentage of Ni is observed from XPS results. Since the surface of Ni12P5 microspheres consist of Ni2+ and Niδ+, both are available for binding with N-PPy. It is important to mention that Ni2+-PPy interaction cannot be overlooked. However, only a minor shift of 0.15 eV is observed towards higher binding energy, indicating slight oxidation of Ni2+ during polymerization. Significant changes in intensity and binding energy were observed in Niδ+ (Fig. 3a and S4b). Due to the intervention of electronegative N centers, Niδ+ peak shifts 0.5 eV towards higher binding energy, generating a slightly more positive Niδ++. A dramatic increase in the intensity of Niδ+ (Figure S4b) indicates higher amounts of nickel phosphide at the interface. This is further corroborated with increased Pδ- at the surface (Figure S4a). Perhaps, this increase in surface Niδ+ is majorly impacting the overall atomic % of Ni, as mentioned earlier. Niδ++ enriched surface indicates strong interactions with N in the polymer shell. Thus, integrating conducting polymer alters the electronic properties of active site by generating highly electrophilic Niδ++ and creating synergic Ni-N interface. 3.3 Co decorated Ni12P5/PPy As described above, due to strong electron coupling interactions, synergic M−N sites are created at the interface of the microsphere and polymer shell. Electronegative N centers near Ni12P5 core bind to positively charged Ni. However, N centers at the outer edge are still available for additional metal binding. Due to high affinity for N, transition metals are perfect candidates for anchoring at this site, forming a hybrid catalyst. Introduction of a second metal at this site not only increases the density of active sites, it also alters the activation energy of OER due to mixed M−N (Co-N and Ni-N) sites. To incorporate Co onto PPy shell, an electrodeposition method was employed using CoCl2 and lithium perchlorate in water. This electrolyte displayed a salmon-pink color corresponding to a hexagonally coordinated [Co(H2O)6]2+ complex [34]. The resulting hybrid catalyst, after electrodeposition, is denoted as Co@Ni12P5/PPy, indicating its multiple layers. Electrochemical diagnostic techniques and TEM were employed to characterize the properties of Co@Ni12P5/PPy. Initially, CV curves were analyzed to resolve various redox peaks in the region −1.2 to 1.2 V during electrodeposition, as shown in Fig. 4 a. A sudden increase in cathodic current around −0.8 signifies the evolution of hydrogen. Apart from this, a small peak is observed around −0.54 V, corresponding to the reduction of Co2+ from solution to metallic Co0. The intensity of this peak is enhanced in Ni12P5/PPy composites, due to the presence of favorable N anchoring sites at the surface. The competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), occurring at > -0.8 V, can reoxidize some of the surface Co0 to Co2+, forming mixed Co species [35,36]. Reverse sweep displayed an anodic peak in CV, corresponding to the stripping of deposited Co0 to Co2+, typical in metal electrodeposition systems [37]. In comparison to Ni12P5, composites show increase in redox peak separation for deposition and stripping of Co0, indicating poor reversibility of this conversion. Potentiostatic current–time transients on different electrode surfaces was conducted to assess interactions of N from PPy with Co during its electrodeposition nucleation growth process (Fig. 4b). With a potential of −1 V for 30 s intended for Co deposition on bare electrode, chronoamperometric curves show a current maximum within 1–2 s. This rising current presents the first stage of electrodeposition due to instantaneous formation of Co nuclei sites and its growth on the electrode surface. In the next stage, a steady state value is reached after a slight decrease in current indicating that the surface is fully covered with Co. In case of PPy coated electrode, the overall current density is lower due to poor conductivity of PPy compared to the composite. However, with highly active Ni12P5/PPy, there is continuous increase in the current due to Co deposition and hydrogen evolution [38]. At −1V, N from polymer is known to interact with the metal undergoing reduction via a charge transfer process [16,39,40]. N centers act as effective sites to immobilize Co from the electrolyte resulting in Co-N bonds [16]. A similar interaction in Co-CP-C composites is demonstrated to enhance electrocatalytic activity due to active Co-N sites [40]. Exsitu characterization using TEM shows Co nanoparticles embedded in the polymeric matrix on the surface of Ni12P5/PPy (Fig. 4c-e) [41,42]. HRTEM exposes the most dominant (111) facet of crystalline Co0. This indicates that mostly metallic Co0 is deposited on the electrode. However, as mentioned earlier, formation of some Co2+ is possible due to HER during electrodeposition process [43]. Many factors affect the distribution and size of these electrodeposited Co nanoparticles like PPy thickness, time and electrode potential. For the scope of this manuscript, we explored the effect of Co-N on OER keeping time as the constant parameter. 3.4 Electrochemical oxygen evolution The electrochemical activity of Ni12P5, Ni12P5/PPy and Co@Ni12P5/PPy for OER is shown in Fig. 5 a. The presented voltammetric curves were taken after 20 cycles of CV to stabilize the electrode current. Overall electrocatalytic performance for different catalysts is typically evaluated in terms of overpotential (η10) at 10 mA/cm2 and Tafel slopes. Co@Ni12P5/PPy demonstrated lowest η10 − 1.59 V, followed by Ni12P5/PPy (1.60 V) and Ni12P5 (1.62 V). In case of Ni12P5/PPy composites, N induces electronic changes in Ni, creating Ni-N bonds [44,45]. As evidenced from XPS, the local atomic structure of the active site consists of highly polarized Niδ++, exhibiting stronger affinity for chemisorbed intermediates and faster electron transfer properties amongst core–shell layers. The decrease in Tafel slope from 62 ± 0.45 mV/dec to 46 ± 0.19 mV/dec for the composites confirm the role of PPy and improved charge transfer properties in core–shell structures. When Co is electrodeposited on Ni12P5/PPy, we generate dual M−N sites; Co-N and Ni-N. During OER analysis, direct electrochemical oxidation of Co sites is indicated by the anodic peak around 1.2 V in initial LSV scan. This peak has been previously associated with the formation of active CoOOH species [46]. Evolution of surface oxidized Co(OH)2 and CoOOH species on Co metal electrode were evidenced using operando XPS at various potentials preceding OER in KOH alkaline electrolyte [47]. After 20 cycles, the associated anodic peak disappears owing to the irreversible oxidative nature of Co(OH)2/CoOOH conversion (Figure S5). Recent work done by Wu et al. describes the formation of such surface oxidized Co species on metallic Co nanoparticles prior to OER [48]. The excellent catalytic performance was attributed to superior electron conductivity of metallic Co core.This suggests the successful involvement of Co as active center for OER. Although, only 10–30 mV improvement is observed at 10 mA/cm2 in Co@Ni12P5/PPy, the hybrid catalyst attains two and five times higher current density (100 mA/cm2 - η100) at a low 1.65 V, compared to Ni12P5/PPy (41.0 mA/cm2) and Ni12P5 (21.6 mA/cm2). This dramatic increase emphasizes the intrinsic changes in reaction kinetics arising due to synergic Co-N and Ni-N sites. Recent work on CoP by Li and his workers demonstrated a promotional effect due to co-existence Fe/Co-N on the electrocatalytic activity, resulting in improved power density and stability for Zn-air batteries [49]. To elucidate the role of PPy in Co@Ni12P5/PPy, a control study was performed where Co was electrodeposited directly on Ni12P5 microspheres, without the PPy shell. It is important to remember that absence of N-C electronegative character at the surface decreases anchoring sites for Co. Consequently, Co@Ni12P5 microspheres exhibit highest η10 (1.65 V) and poor performance (Fig. 5a). Electrochemical oxygen evolution on metal based catalysts occur via a 4e- transfer process involving M−OH*, M−O* and M−OOH* intermediates [50]. A close relation is observed between binding energies of these intermediates and the active metal electronic structure affecting overall OER performance [51]. Tafel relationship linearly correlates the current measured to applied potential, revealing reaction kinetics. Computational modeling has been used to assess changes in the rate determining step (RDS) of a reaction to govern Tafel slopes [52,53]. Although Tafel analysis cannot solely predict the exact RDS of the reaction, it can provide possible insights on the mechanistic pathways based on calculated Tafel slopes. Tafel analysis on pure Ni12P5 revealed a value of 62 mV/dec (Fig. 5b), suggesting that the RDS relates to the chemisorption of OH–. The trend in Tafel slopes for transition metal phosphides exhibit a series of values in the range 60–120 mV/dec [54,55]. Correlating the effects described in the previous section, a decrease in Tafel slope to 46 mV/dec, for Ni12P5/PPy, reveals improved kinetics. Presence of highly electrophilic Niδ++, likely increases affinity for OH– chemisorption. Tafel slope was further lowered to 40 ± 0.14 mV/dec in Co@Ni12P5/PPy, supporting the accelerated charge transfer kinetics due to dual M−N sites. Stability tests performed on Co@Ni12P5/PPy (Fig. 5c) showed an increase of 10 mV (η10), without compromising the overall current density at higher potentials. Post electrochemical cycling, hybrid catalyst was assessed using PXRD and TEM techniques as shown in Figure S6. Major diffraction lines corresponding to the tetragonal Ni12P5 indicates that there is no phase change post OER. TEM images illustrate the retention of core–shell structure with embedded Co nanoparticles. Table S1 summaries experimental standard deviation of η10 from three independent measurements and verifies the reproducibility. To further our understanding on the improved reaction kinetics, electrochemical impedance (EIS) analysis was performed at OER operating potential on these catalysts as shown in Fig. 5d. The impedance data were fitted for each catalyst as per the equivalent electrical circuit is given in the inset of Fig. 5d. All catalysts exhibited a solution resistance (Rs) in the range of 6.8 – 7.1 Ω. The trend in charge transfer resistance (Rct) obtained from the Nyquist plot is given as: Co@Ni12P5/PPy (2.93 Ω) < Co@Ni12P5 (4.91 Ω) < Ni12P5/PPy (8.51 Ω) < Ni12P5 (10.19 Ω). The charge transfer resistance is greatly reduced in the hybrid Co@Ni12P5/PPy, which validates the low Tafel slope. Incorporation of M−N bonds at the surface, promotes metal electrophilicity resulting in superior electron transfer rate. In addition to this, the calculated double layer capacitance (Cdl) values obtained using Gamry analyst software indicates a 50-fold increase for the hybrid Co@Ni12P5/PPy in comparison to Ni12P5 as shown in Table S2. Since, the unitless fitting parameter n is > 0.78 for all catalysts, capacitance due to CPE can be considered to be quasi-equivalent to pure capacitance. Table S2 showing an increase in capacitance from 0.15 mF/cm2 (Ni12P5) to 3.24 mF/cm2 (Ni12P5/PPy), can be attributed to the excellent electronic interaction between the core–shell morphology. With the introduction of dual synergic effect, there is an enhanced double layer capacitance (Cdl) in Co@Ni12P5/PPy with a value of 8.20 mF/cm2. The trend in capacitance can be extrapolated to electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the catalysts. ECSA can be obtained by diving Cdl with specific capacitance (Cs) of the sample. McCrory et al. reported Cs values for catalysts with various compositions and elements in the range of 0.022–0.13 mF/cm2 in alkaline solutions [4,56]. Due to the complexity of the hybrid catalyst, values measured in this work should be regarded as a guide for comparing ECSA. It is also essential to note the broad range of experimentally determined intrinsic capacitance of PPy (60–1200F/cm2) [57] that makes it difficult to quantify ECSA of hybrid catalyst . Therefore, comparing specific activity in terms of capacitance from EIS could overestimate the actual catalytic centers. In such cases, ECSA calculations using redox peak method is accepted to be the most accurate, especially in 3d TM based catalysts [58]. We refer to this editorial feature for elaborate calculations in determining the number of active metal sites. TM catalysts exhibit a distinct redox peak corresponding to M2+/M3+ before the onset of OER. Detailed mechanistic studies have revealed the conductive M3+ to be the most active for OER [59]. Integrated area of the anodic peak from LSV, corresponding to this metal oxidation process, gives an accurate number of metal active sites responsible for OER. The number of Ni sites calculated using this technique for Ni12P5 and Ni12P5/PPy corresponds to 1.16E16 and 6.30E15, respectively. With same catalyst loading on electrode, actual number of Ni sites are reduced for Ni12P5/PPy due to mass contribution from PPy. Increase in loading for Ni12P5/PPy to maintain the same number of Ni sites resulted in decreased activity due to the presence of large amount of less conductive PPy. Therefore, mass of the overall catalyst was maintained at 0.1 mg/cm2 for Ni12P5/PPy to avoid self-masking of the catalytic centers. In case of Co@Ni12P5/PPy, 30 s of optimized Co electrodeposition resulted in similar total metal sites. The number of metal sites catalyzing OER from the integrated area under the redox peak is found to be 1.11E16. Considering the number of active metal sites in Ni12P5 completely covers the geometric area of the electrode, relative ECSA for both Ni12P5 and Co@Ni12P5/PPy has similar values. The observed increase in OER performance and kinetics is attributed to the dual synergic M−N sites in Co@Ni12P5/PPy. Enhancements in OER performance in Ni based catalysts due to trace amounts of accidental Fe incorporation has shown to be crucial [60-63]. The inherent increase in OER performance in Ni-Fe systems is associated to reaction intermediate energetics at Ni-O-Fe active sites. Boettcher et al. demonstrated characteristic anodic shift (>55 mV after 100 cycles) of the redox peak corresponding to Ni(OH)2/NiOOH in codeposited Ni-Fe catalysts [62]. In such cases, anodic shift in redox peak position is related to changes in electronic structure and helps identify accidental incorporation of Fe. Recent work done by Chinnappan et al. attributed the enhancement in OER performance to Ni2+/Ni3+ transformation and not accidental Fe incorporation in PPy/IL nanoparticles during Py polymerization [64]. To understand the incorporation of Fe in our catalysts during Py polymerization, we compared the CV redox peak positions of all the three electrocatalysts (Fig. 5e). As demonstrated, no significant shift in redox peak position for Ni12P5/PPy is observed compared to Ni12P5. In reference to hybrid catalyst, cathodic shift suggests facilitated M2+/M3+ conversion. With increased number of metal sites via Co incorporation, OER performance improves due to more available active sites compared to Ni12P5/PPy and better chemisorption of hydroxyl ions. To our knowledge, employing CPs for OER is not well established, especially PPy based catalysts. A compilation from literature on PPy functionalized metal catalysts employed for OER is reported in Table S3. With this hybrid Co@Ni12P5/PPy catalyst, we achieved excellent enhancement while maintaining stability in comparison to the other catalysts reported in literature. 4 Conclusions In this work, a novel hybrid catalyst Co@Ni12P5/PPy is strategically synthesized with a precise choice of individual components. This hybrid catalyst features excellent current density at low overpotential and long-term stability. Enhanced activity is primarily due to dual synergic charge transfer effects between the M−N sites. This strong electron coupling effects between different layers decrease the charge transfer resistance to 2.93 Ω with a low Tafel slope of 40 mV/dec, achieving facile kinetics. Electronegative N in PPy effectively increases nickel phosphide at the Ni12P5/PPy interface and boosts OH– chemisorption. With the incorporation of Co, the number of electrochemically active M−N sites are increased compared to Ni12P5/PPy. Presence of polarized M−N bonds create stronger electrophilic metal site which facilitates the rate determining OH– chemisorption step. This work offers the possibility of employing PPy shell as an excellent constituent for creating multiple M−N active sites, introducing a new class of polypyrrole analogues for enhancing the activity of metal-based catalysts.

        "dc:description": "Electrochemical water splitting could be an efficient alternative route for clean and renewable energy storage. However, widespread application of this technique is hindered by the high overpotential required for the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this contribution, we report that novel N based conducting polymers exhibit excellent charge transfer properties with earth abundant transition metals. A strong interaction between Ni and N from polypyrrole (PPy) was identified via XPS, resulting in higher amounts of Niδ++ sites at the interface. Electronegative N from PPy shell, covering Ni12P5 microspheres, interacts with Ni on the inner edge and electrodeposited Co on the outer edge, establishing a dual synergic effect. This hybrid catalyst, with Co-N and Ni-N active interfaces, demonstrates faster OER kinetics owing to improved electrophilicity towards hydroxyl ions. With dual M-N sites, Co@Ni12P5/PPy displays a low Tafel slope of 40 mV/dec and stability up to 7 h of electrochemical cycling. This work enables discovery of a new class of anode materials based on metal-PPy analogs for alkaline OER.",
