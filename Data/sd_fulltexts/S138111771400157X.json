Graphical abstract The synthesis of both enantiomers of four new phenylthiazole-based amines by enantiomer-selective acylation of racemic amines and by hydrolysis of the corresponding racemic amides using lipase B from Candida antarctica (Novozyme 435) as chiral catalyst was performed with good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. In order to prevent the frequently occurring partial racemization of enantiopure amides during chemical hydrolysis to the corresponding (R)-amines, the deprotection of the N-acylated (R)-enantiomers by mild enzymatic hydrolysis with lipase A from C. antarctica immobilized on Celite was also developed. Keywords Phenylthiazole Chiral ethanamines Enzymatic kinetic resolution Lipases Amide hydrolysis 1 Introduction Enantiopure amines and their derivatives are important chiral building blocks and final products especially in the agrochemical, food, pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. In particular, arylethanamines present valuable industrial applications in the synthesis of pesticides [1]. Heterocyclic ring systems, including thiazole as a well known integral part of all available penicillins, are found as key active component of many drugs, as recently pointed [2]. For instance, 2-phenyl-thiazole derivatives were obtained and a detailed study of their selective antiflaviviral activity was realized [3]. With increasing demand for this type of compounds and interest in environmental aspects, research in this field has led to efforts to establish viable synthetic methods that meet the principles of green chemistry. In this regard, biocatalytic approaches using enzymes as chiral catalysts, especially in organic solvents, are extensively applied. Several chemocatalytic methods for the preparation of various enantiomerically enriched arylethanamines are described in literature. One of the most common methods for the enantioselective synthesis of amines is the Ru- or Rh-catalyzed reductive amination of carbonyl compounds [4]. Another procedure uses a microwave technique to produce the (S)-enantiomer of some heteroaryl-ethanamines from the corresponding N-protected α-L-amino acids [5]. Rhodium-catalyzed hydrogenation of N-sulfonyl ketimine [6] is also described for the asymmetric synthesis of ethanamines. In addition to these, Sigamide-catalyzed enantioselective reduction of ketimines with trichlorosilane also produced selectively the (S)-enantiomer of various ethanamines [7]. All these chemical methods require expensive reagents, hard work-up and are time consuming. In contrast, the enzymatic approaches are easier to handle, do not need special reaction conditions and most importantly, they are “eco-friendly”. Biocatalytic approaches for obtaining enantiomerically enriched ethanamines commonly use hydrolytic enzymes or transaminases. Lipases were succesfully used in the kinetic resolution of amines through N-acylation reactions [1,8]. Hoff and co. reported [9] the synthesis of some chiral N-benzyl-N-methyl-1-(naphthalen-1-yl)ethanamines and their in vitro antifungal activity using in the key step, the enzymatic kinetic resolution of the racemic 1-(naphthalen-1-yl)ethanamine, immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica (commercialized as Novozyme 435) as catalyst, ethyl 2-methoxyacetate as acyl donor and hexane as solvent at 60°C with excellent yield and enantioselectivity (E >200). A detailed study [10] regarding the kinetic resolution of three racemic ethanamines by acetylation using variously immobilized C. antarctica lipase B indicates that the temperature effect on the selectivity and activity strongly depends on the substrate structure and on the used immobilization method. The CaL-B-catalyzed acylation of various amines and amino-alcohols with myristic acid as acyl donor was also investigated with the aim to explain and control the chemoselectivity of this enzyme, in the specific acylation of bifunctional substrates [11]. The same enzyme was used in the resolution of racemic 1-aryl-allylamines with moderate to excellent enantioselectivity (ee 63.5–99.9%) [12a]. Caffeic acid amides in high enantiopuritiy (ee 98.5%) were obtained by Novozyme 435-catalyzed aminolysis of racemic ester in isooctane at 70°C [12b]. Recently, a continuous flow process for the kinetic resolution of rac-1-phenylethylamine using ethyl acetate as acyl donor and Novozyme 435 as catalyst with high enantiomeric ratios (E >200) and short residence time (40min) at 70°C was reported [13]. A series of primary amine enantiomers were obtained using ω-transaminase from Vibrio fluvialis [14], Arthrobacter sp. sol–gel immobilized [15a] or with Escherichia coli whole cell with ω-transaminase activity [15b]. One of the most frequently used biocatalytic methods is the enzymatic kinetic resolution of a racemate with an adequate hydrolytic enzyme. Enantioselectivity, high stability and commercial availability in both free and immobilized forms have made lipases (EC 3.1.1.3) attractive kinetic resolution catalysts either through the acylation of a nucleophylic functionality (amine or an alcohol) or through the deacylation (hydrolysis, alcoholysis or interesterification) of an amidic or esteric group of the target molecule. Our aim has been to prepare both enantiomers of four phenylthiazole-based ethanamines in a highly enantiomerically enriched form by a chemoenzymatic pathway (Scheme 1 ). Using the immobilized lipase B from C. antarctica (Novozyme 435) in the enzymatic kinetic resolution of racemic ethanamines rac-4a–d through N-acylation and of racemic ethanamides rac-5a–d through hydrolysis, a new enzymatic procedure was developed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and methods All reagents were purchased from Aldrich or Fluka and used as received. Solvents and acyl donors for enzymatic reactions were stored over molecular sieves unless otherwise stated. Lipase from Pseudomonas fluorescens (AK) was obtained from Amano, England, while lipase from Candida rugosa (CrL) was purchased from Fluka. Lipase A from C. antarctica free or immobilized by adsorption on Celite (CaL-A) was a gift from Professor Liisa T. Kanerva, University of Turku. Immobilized lipase B from C. antarctica (CaL-B, Novozyme 435) was purchased from Novozyme, Denmark and free CaL-B from Chiral Vision, Netherlands. Lipase PS from Burkholderia cepacia (Pseudomonas cepacia) was purchased from Amano, Aldrich. The enzymatic reactions were performed at 23°C (room temperature) or at 45°C. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker spectrometers operating at 300 or 400MHz and 75 or 100MHz, respectively, at 25°C. Data for mass spectra analysis (ESI+–MS) were taken on a VG 7070E mass spectrometer operating at 70eV. HRMS data were measured in ESI+ mode with Bruker Avance microOTOF-Qquadrupole-TOF spectrometer. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Merck Kieselgel 60F254 sheets. Spots were visualized by treatment with 5% ethanolic phosphomolybdic acid solution and heating. Melting points were determined by hot plate method and are uncorrected. The optical rotations were determined with Bellingham–Stanley ADP 220 polarimeter, using chloroform for 5a–d and methanol for 4a–d (c =1mg/mL) as solvents; [α]D 25 values are given in units of 10−1deg×cm2 ×g−1. The enantiomeric separation of rac- 4a–d and rac- 5a–d was performed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) conducted with Agilent 1200 and 1260 systems. Therefore the separation of the racemic ethanamides was accomplished on Chiralcel OJ-H column (4.6×250mm) using n-hexane: 2-propanol in different proportions at a flow rate of 1.0mL/min as mobile phase. The enantiomeric separation of the racemic ethanamines rac-4a,b was performed on a Chiralpak ZWIX(+) column (4.0×250mm) using acetonitrile:methanol (50mM formic acid, 25mM DEA):H2O (78:28:2, v/v/v) at 1.0mL/min flow rate as mobile phase, while the separation of rac-4c,d on Chiralcel OJ-H column was obtained with n-hexane:2-propanol (0.02% DEA) as eluent at 0.9mL/min flow rate. Table 1 contains data for the HPLC chromatographic separation of the racemic derivatives. The determination of the E value was based on the equation E =ln[(1− c)(1− ee S)]/ln[(1− c)(1+ ee S)], with c = ee S/(ee S + ee P) using linear regression (E as the slope of the line ln[(1− c)(1− ee S)] versus ln[(1− c)(1+ ee S)]) [16]. 2.2 Chemical synthesis 2.2.1 Synthesis of rac-2a–d One of the aldehydes 1a–d (1mmol) dissolved in diethyl ether (5mL) was added into the ice-cooled solution of the Grignard reagent prepared by treating CH3I (1.2Equiv.) with magnesium (1.2Equiv.) and I2 (a crystal) in dry diethyl ether at reflux under argon atmosphere until the magnesium was consumed. The mixture was refluxed overnight. After cooling, saturated ammonium chloride solution was added dropwise under vigorous stirring on an ice bath. The separated organic layer was next extracted with CH2Cl2 (3×5mL), dried on anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated in vacuum. The crude product was purified by column chromatography using CH2Cl2:CH3OH (9:1, v/v) as eluent, affording the pure racemic alcohols rac- 2a–d as yellow semi-solids with 57–70% yields. 2.2.2 Synthesis of racemic azides (rac-3a–d) Diphenyl phosphonic azide (1.5Equiv.) was added to a solution of rac- 2a-d (1mmol) dissolved in dry degassed toluene (2mL). The mixture was cooled at 0°C and neat DBU (1.5Equiv.) was added under argon atmosphere. The reaction was stirred for 3h at 0°C, then slowly warmed to room temperature and the reaction mixture was stirred for an additional 16h. The resulting two-phase mixture was washed with water (2×20mL) and 5% HCl solution. (20mL). The organic layer, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, was further concentrated in vacuum and purified on silica gel with CH2Cl2 as eluent providing the desired azides rac-3a–d as yellow liquids with 65–95% yield. 2.2.3 Synthesis of racemic amines (rac-4a–d) The reduction of racemic azides rac-3a–d to amines rac-4a–d was performed according to a procedure described in literature [17]. To the solution of azides (1mmol) and ammonium chloride (2.6Equiv.) in ethyl alcohol (27mL) and water (9mL), activated zinc powder (1.3Equiv.) was added. The mixture was stirred vigorously at reflux and after approximately 4h all the reactions were completed (monitored by TLC). Finally, ethyl acetate and aqueous ammonia (25%) were added and the mixture was filtered to remove the unreacted zinc. The isolated organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was purified on silica gel using sequentially two eluents: firstly, CH2Cl2:CH3OH (9:1, v/v) was used to recover the unreacted azide and then CH2Cl2:CH3OH (8:2, v/v) was used to elute the racemic amines. The final products rac-4a–d were obtained as yellow semi-solids with 90–97% yields. 2.2.3.1 1-(2-phenylthiazol-4-yl)ethanamine (rac-4a) Yield 97%; yellow semi-solid; 1H NMR (300MHz, CDCl3, 25°C): δ =1.51 (d, J =7Hz, 3H); 1.91 (broad signal); 4.27 (q, J =7Hz, 1H); 7.04 (s, 1H); 7.43 (m, 3H); 7.93–7.96 (m, 2H) ppm. 13C NMR (75MHz, CDCl3, 25°C): δ =23.52; 48.15; 111.90; 125.68; 129.02; 130.05; 133.89; 163.31; 168.31ppm.

Reactions proceeded under shaking (1350rpm) at 23°C and were monitored by TLC and HPLC analysis. After approximately 16h the reactions were considered to be completed. 2.3.2 Analytical scale hydrolysis 10mg of a CaL-B or CaL-A preparation were weighed in a reaction vial before rac-5a–d or (R)-5a–d (7.3μmol) were added in water (1mL). The mixtures were shaken at r.t. or at 45°C. The progress of the reactions was monitored by TLC and HPLC analysis. 2.3.3 Preparative scale N-acylation The N-acylation of racemic amines at preparative scale was performed using substrate:biocatalyst ratio and reaction conditions as for the analytical scale. Therefore, Novozyme 435 (1500mg) and molecular sieves were weighed in a reaction vial before rac-4a–d (1.5mmol) and ethyl n-butyrate (6mmol) were added in ACN (20mL). The mixtures were shaken at 1350rpm at 23°C for approximately 16h to reach 50% conversion. The enzyme was filtered off, washed with ACN and the combined organic phases were concentrated in vacuum. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with CH2Cl2:CH3OH (9.5:0.5, v/v) and CH2Cl2:CH3OH (8:2, v/v) as eluent. The properties of obtained chiral derivatives are presented in Table 2, Part A. 2.3.4 Preparative scale hydrolysis Novozyme 435 or CaL-A on Celite (1000mg) were weighed in a reaction vial before the aqueous solution of rac-5a–d or (R)-5a–d (20mL, 0.73mmol) was added. The mixtures were shaken at 45°C. The progress of the reactions was monitored by TLC and HPLC analysis. When the reactions were completed, the reaction mixtures were freezed and the water was removed by lyophilization. The products were dissolved in CH2Cl2 and the enzyme was filtered off. Next, the solution was concentrated in vacuum and the crude product was purified by column chromatography with CH2Cl2:CH3OH as eluent, with a gradient from initial 5% (v/v) to 20% (v/v) to yield (R)-amines and (S)-amides with excellent enantiomeric excesses at approximately 50% conversion or optically pure (R)-4a–d as yellow semi-solids; data presented in Table 2, Part B. 2.4 Absolute configuration To a solution of rac-2a (1mmol) in toluene (10mL), vinyl acetate (4mmol), Novozyme 435 (40mg/mL) and molecular sieves were added. The mixture was shaken at 1350rpm at room temperature. The process was monitored by TLC and HPLC analysis. The reaction was completed in approximately 6h. The enzyme was filtered off, the solvent was removed in vacuum and the crude product was purified by column chromatography with CH2Cl2:acetone (25:1, v/v) as eluent. The isolated (S)-2a was further transformed into the azide (R)-3a and next reduced to give (R)-4a following the procedures described above. Yield: 87%. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Chemical synthesis Based on the methods described in literature, the preparation of amines rac-4a–d from the corresponding aldehydes 1a–d was first studied. The racemic ethanols rac-2a–d obtained by Grignard reaction [18] were transfomed into racemic amines rac-4a–d via azide derivatives rac-3a–d as shown in Scheme 1 (route a, steps I–III). Racemic amides rac-5a–d were obtained by chemical acylation of rac-4a–d with butyryl chloride in dichloromethane, in the presence of pyridine and a catalytic amount of DMAP (Scheme 1, route a, step IV). 3.2 Enzymatic synthesis In order to investigate the stereoselectivity of the reactions involving chiral 1-(2-phenylthiazol-4-yl)ethanamines rac-4a–d and their amides rac-5a–d, the chromatographic separation of the enantiomers was first established. The base-line separation of all the enantiomers of rac-4,5a–d was performed using appropriate HPLC chiral columns. The chromatographic enantiomer separation of rac-4c,d was successfully performed when small amounts of diethylamine (DEA) [19] was added to the mobile phase (Table 1). 3.2.1 Analytical scale enzymatic N-acylation of rac -4a–d Common commercial lipase preparations [25mg/mL; lipases from C. rugosa (CrL), P. fluorescens (AK), lipase A from C. antarctica immobilized by adsorption on Celite (CaL-A), immobilized lipase B from C. antarctica (CaL-B, Novozyme 435) and Amano lipase PS from B. cepacia (P. cepacia)] were screened for the N-acylation of the model compound, rac-4a, at room temperature. In order to find the optimal reaction conditions for the N-acylation of rac-4a the analytical scale enzymatic reactions were conducted in various organic solvents using four different acyl donors like ethyl acetate, isopropyl n-butyrate, ethyl n-butyrate, ethyl propionate (4Equiv. each). The tested solvents, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), acetonitrile (ACN), dichloromethane, toluene and diisopropyl ether (DIPE), were selected as they are frequently used in organic synthesis and industry and are known for their compatibility with lipases. The addition of molecular sieve [4Å; the ratio to the catalyst 1:1 (w/w)] to the reaction medium was necessary since even small traces of water could promote lipase-catalyzed hydrolytic reactions. In this case, the hydrolysis of the amidic group could lead to the formation of an ammonium salt between the amine and the liberated acid, thus lowering the enantioselectivity of the kinetic resolution. Some lipases (CRL, PS-free and AK on Celite) proved to be catalytically inactive even after 28h, while CaL-A showed either no activity or poor selectivity in MTBE with isopropyl n-butyrate and ethyl n-butyrate. The highest enantioselectivity ( E ≫ 2 00 ) and reactivity (c =50%) for the CaL-B mediated N-acylation of rac-4a were obtained with ethyl n-butyrate as acyl donor in dry ACN as solvent after 16h (Table 3 , entry 3). 3.2.2 Preparative scale enzymatic N-acylation of rac-4a–d The developed small-scale kinetic resolution method of rac-4a was next used for the preparative-scale kinetic resolution of all substrates rac-4a–d (1.5mmol) with ethyl n-butyrate (6mmol) and Novozyme 435 (75mg/mL) in dry ACN (Scheme 1, step V). The highly enantioselective N-acylations of the reactive (R)-4a–c ( E ≫ 2 00 ) were all completed (c ∼50%) in 16h. Lower selectivity and activity of the enzyme was observed when the chlorinated rac-4d was subjected to the same biotransformation (E =125, c ∼46% after 16h). The resolution products [the unreacted (S)-4a–d and the obtained (R)-5a–d] were isolated at close to 50% theoretical yields (93–97% from the theoretical amounts at 50% conversion) in highly enantiopure forms (ee 82–99%) (Table 2Part A). 3.2.3 Kinetic resolution and deprotection of (R)-5a–d by lipase catalyzed hydrolysis Recently, a very important feature that affords amide hydrolysis by serine proteases was attributed to the hydrogen bond formed between the substrate's amide nitrogen and the enzyme or the substrate itself, thus facilitating the nitrogen inversion during the catalytic process [20]. Even though lipases have the same catalytic triad, some of them lack this particular hydrogen bond and, subsequently, the ability to efficiently cleave amides. However, previous results showing that lipases CaL-A [21,22] and CaL-B [1,22,23] can hydrolyze amides in water, encouraged us to study the hydrolysis of the arylethanamides using lipases as catalysts. In order to obtain the opposite enantiomeric forms of the enantiomerically enriched 1-(2-phenylthiazol-4-yl)ethanamines [the (S)-enantiomers], the lipase-mediated kinetic resolution of rac-5a–d was investigated (Scheme 1, route b). To this extent, several CaL-A and CaL-B preparations were tested for the selective hydrolysis of the model compound rac-5a. Analytical scale hydrolytic reactions were performed in water at room temperature and at 45°C using four enzyme preparations (Table 4 ). It is worth mentioning that the addition of any co-solvent was not necessary. As expected, the results show a greater reaction rate for the reactions performed at 45°C. All CaL-B-mediated hydrolysis were highly enantioselective, the best reactivity was achieved with Novozyme 435 (Table 4, entry 1). CaL-A (free or immobilized on Celite) proved to be a highly active but non-stereoselective catalyst for the same transformations. On terms of reactivity, CaL-A on Celite gave the highest reactivity at 45°C (Table 4, entry 4). Novozyme 435-catalyzed preparative scale hydrolysis of rac-5a–d proceeded enantioselectively and afforded the (R)-amines and (S)-amides with excellent enantiomeric excesses at approximately 50% conversion. The enantioselective hydrolytic reactions were completed in 80h for rac-5a,b and 90h for rac-5c,d (Table 2, Part B). Nevertheless (R)-4a–d amines could be provided also by the deprotection of (R)-5a–d amides. In our try to avoid the racemization and due to the instability of the heteroaryl ring against traditional acid- and base-catalyzed hydrolysis we used the CaL-A mediated hydrolytic deprotection of (R)-5a–d amides. The CaL-A on Celite mediated preparative scale hydrolytic reactions of (R)-5a–d were performed at 45°C yielding quantitatively the corresponding enantiomerically enriched (R)-4a–d amines in 60h (Table 2, Part B). 3.3 Determination of the absolute configuration The absolute configuration of (R)-4a was determined by first preparing the corresponding alcohol according to the previous method and resolving it with Novozyme 435 in neat vinyl acetate, yielding (S)-2a with 99% ee (Scheme 1, route c) [24]. The subsequent transformations of (S)-2a to (R)-4a following the procedure described above did not affect significantly the enantiopurity of the involved compounds. The optical rotation measured for (R)-4a obtained in this way gave [α]D 25 =+6.3 (c =1.0, CH3OH) at 95% ee, which is in accordance with the value [α]D 25 =+6.4 (c =1.0, CH3OH) at 99% ee obtained for the CaL-B-catalyzed hydrolysis of rac-5a in water (Table 2, Part B). It is reasonable to assume that Novozyme 435 manifests the same enantiopreference with the other substrates too in N-acylation and hydrolytic reactions. The (R)-enantiopreference of Novozyme 435 shown herein has proved to be in accordance with the enantiopreference observed before for the enzyme in N-acylations of arylethanamines [8a,22]. 4 Conclusions An efficient new procedure for the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched (R)- and (S)-1-(2-phenylthiazol-4-yl)ethanamines has been developed (ee 82–99%, E ≫ 2 00 except the chlorinated compound when E =125). It was found that CaL-B (Novozyme 435) is the proper catalyst for both enantioselective N-acylation and hydrolysis. The CaL-B-mediated kinetic resolution of rac-4a–d through N-acylation occured best using ethyl n-butyrate as acyl donor in acetonitrile as solvent at room temperature. The Novozyme 435-mediated hydrolysis of rac-5a–d was optimal in water at 45°C, with no need for additional co-solvents. Deprotection of (R)-5a–d to the corresponding (R)-4a–d was achieved faster using CaL-A immobilized on Celite, without affecting the optical purity. Amide hydrolysis is generally uncommon to lipases which naturally hydrolyze fatty acid glycerol esters but these studies have proven once more the versatility of this type of enzymes. The amidase activity of lipases observed here is of great interest for organic synthesis as it offers an alternative mild method for deprotection of amides or for resolving racemic amides since chemical decomposition and racemization was avoided.
