Hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (CO2) to formic acid is explored through density functional theory calculations over Co decorated penta-graphene (Co@PG) as single atom catalyst (SAC). Co is successfully stabilized over pentagraphene due to strong overlapping of Co-3d and C-2p states of pentagonal ring of pentagraphene near fermi level. The higher diffusion barrier for Co over pentagraphene evince that the clustering of Co atom is restricted. This suggests that Co@PG can be used as a catalyst for reducing CO2. Moreover, the Hirshfeld charge density, molecular electrostatic potential and spin density analysis indicates that the Co site is the highly active site for CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Both CO2 and H2 show strong interaction with Co@PG. In co-adsorbed state, the interactions are even larger due to greater mutual polarization of reactants and localization of positive charge on Co with adsorption energy of -2.57 eV. The hydrogenation can proceed at ambient temperature due to a small energy barrier of 0.29 eV, the competitive reaction i.e. CO hydrogenation with CO2 hydrogenations almost impossible over the catalyst surface due to larger energy barriers i.e. 1.98 eV. Thus, this work shows that Co@PG can be used as an efficient and promising catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation at room temperature.

Among greenhouse gases, CO2 is considered a major contributor [4] as it is released in greater amount and has considerably long atmospheric lifetime [5]. Its atmospheric concentration has been increased by almost 45 % in the last century i.e. from 270 to 400 ppm and is expected to rise up to 570 ppm by the end of 21st century [6]. Control on emissions and decrease in atmospheric CO2 is thus essential need of time. Various techniques have been implied for sequestration and removal of excess CO2 [7]. but its conversion to chemical feed stock and other useful chemicals seem advantageous as it is inexpensive, ample and non-toxic [5]. It can be converted to many chemicals for instance methane, methanol, ethanol, glycerol, format etc. [8]. but reduction to formic acid is promising due to greater atom economy and widespread uses of formic acid as feed stock in leather tanning, textile and pharmaceutical industries [9] Formic acid can be used as hydrogen storage material as it produces hydrogen by catalytic degradation [10]. The only difficulty is the stability of CO2 at ambient temperature and need a catalyst to initiate its conversion. Many transition metal-based catalysts have been used for the activation of CO2 but their scarcity and cost hinders their industrial applications [11,12]. Recently, single atom catalysts (SACs) have drawn considerable attention due to their selectivity, high catalytic activity, greater atomic efficiency, low cost and exceptional stability [5,13–16]. SACs comprise two-dimensional materials having spatially isolated catalytic atoms of a metal directly boundto the support [17]. Unlike conventional catalysts, each metal atom can take part incatalysis. The catalytic properties can further be enhanced by tailoring the coordination environment of catalytic atoms[18,19]. As of now, many single-atom catalysts with superior catalytic activities than conventional catalysts over carbon-based surfaces have been successfully designed for various purposes like oxidation [20,21], hydrogenation [22,23], N2 conversion [24,25] and CO2 conversion [5,18,26]. Extensive work is available on graphene [27] in this regard while little attention has been paid to pentagraphene. However, pentagraphene is more beneficial than pristine graphene for SACs due to its high diffusion barrier necessary for avoiding clustering and maintaining spatial isolation of catalytic atoms [28].It is a 2D allotrope of carbon with both sp and sp2 hybridized carbons. Penta graphene (PG) framed of carbon-pentagons, suggested theoretically [29] is a 2D material having lightweight and depicts the furrow pathways on the surface [29,30]. Commonly lightweight materials have fast ions diffusion and good capacity for adsorbing metals at its surface. Possible experimental procedures were proposed for the synthesis of PG [29,30]. Till now, PG has been prefigured to be the promising testee for wide range of applications likewise the nano mechanics, optical devices, and nanoelectronics, because of its unique features i.e. atomic and electronic structures [31–36]. The current study is based on evaluation of anchoring capacity of penta-graphene through DFT calculations to design efficient SACs. The electronic and structural properties of the designed SACs are explored along with its thermodynamic stability. The underlying mechanism for the reduction of CO2 to formic acid through SACs is also unveiled. The results indicate that Co incorporated pentagraphene based SAC is an efficient candidate for hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid. Furthermore, as catalytic mechanism on single active site is currently relying on trial and error experiments due to insufficient characterization techniques and spatial/time resolution, this study could help to provide detail insight in understanding the underlying mechanism and experimental designing of SACs for CO2 reduction and other applications as well. 2 Simulations details DMol3 code was used for quantum chemical calculations by employing spin unrestricted density functional theory (DFT) approach [37,38]. Geometry optimization and electronic properties were simulated using Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional with gradient correction through generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) [39]. All computations were executed using double numerical plus polarization (DNP) function as basis set. For van der Waals interactions, DFT-D method was applied as in Grimme's scheme[40,41]. For high quality results, thermal-smearing parameter of 0.005 au and basis set cutoff of 4.6 Å were selected throughout the calculations. The convergence-tolerance, maximum force and displacement were 1 × 10−5 Ha for energy, 0.001 Ha/Å for force and 0.005 Å for displacement respectively.The stability of all optimized structures was confirmed by performing frequency calculations to determine zero imaginary frequency at the same level of theory. The E ad of Co atom incorporated into pentagraphene was calculated to determine the stability of the designed catalyst using the following equation; (1) E a d = E C o @ P G − ( E P G + E C o ) Where, E Co@PG and E PG are total optimized energies of Co-incorporated and pure penta-graphene sheet while ECo is the single point energy of Co atom, respectively. Adsorption energies (E ad) of other complexes were calculated through the following general equation; (2) E a d = E c o m p l e x − ( E s o r b e n t + E a d s o r b a t e ) Where, E complex, E adsorbent and E adsorbate are optimized energies of H2/CO/CO2Co@PG(complex), Co-incorporated pentagraphene sheet (adsorbent) and H2, CO and CO2 gas (adsorbate), respectively. Minimum energy pathway (MEP) was calculated by nudged elastic band (NEB) method while atomic charges and charge transfer were obtained from population analysis using Hirshfeld scheme [42]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Geometry, electronic structure and stability of pristine pentagraphene and Co-decorated pentagraphene The relaxed structure of 3 × 3 × 1 supercell of penta-graphene (PG) and band structure computed at GGA/PBE is exemplified in Figure S1(a, b). The calculated lattice-parameters are a = b = 10.50 Å with a 1.213 Å thickness. The C1C1 and C1C2 bond lengths are 1.33 and 1.51 Å[29,30,43]. The band gap of PG is about 2.44/3.01 eV shows semiconductor nature [29,30,43]. The band structure and total density of states (TDOS) computed at PBE/HSE06 is portrayed in Figure S2. The charge density analysis calculated via Hirshfeld method signifies that the C1 atoms have −0.012 e charge and the C2 atoms have 0.024 e charge reflecting discrete electronic-geometry instead of uniform charged-distribution. The formation energy (energy per-C atom) of various carbon-based systems [30], implies that PG is intermediate energetic state (metastable) as compared to graphene and some allotropes of graphene [44–49] while more stable than some nano-porous carbon-phases e.g. α-graphyne [48], (3,12)-carbon-sheet [50], T-carbon [51], C20 fullerene cage [52] and the smallest carbon-nanotube [53]. Beside, mechanical and dynamical stability PG can also resist a high temperature of 1000 K [29]. Furthermore, recent literature give assurance for the productive synthesis of PG [33,54–60]. Pristine PG is not considered a good absorber for gases as negligible electron transfer and interactions happens to occur. It needs to be modified with electropositive metal atoms for the corresponding purpose. Cobalt was incorporated to increase its potential for adsorption of gases. The most stable configuration is shown in Fig. 1 (a), in which Co bonds with CC at top position of pentagon carbons having bond lengths of 1.83Å on average as reported previously [61]. The adsorption energy E ads was found to be −2.90 eV showing the easy incorporation, strong attachment and chemisorbed nature of Co with PG.The adsorption is accompanied by the induction of 0.079 e charge on Co in Hirshfeld charge analysis. These findings are supported by molecular electrostatic potential map shown in Fig. 1(b). The large blue region over Co is electron deficient region while the red area shows electron accumulation over acetylenic carbons mainly due to sp hybridized orbitals on these carbons and donor nature of cobalt. The spin density diagram in Fig. 1(c) shows that Co@PG is magnetic in nature. The magnetic moment is centered on Co which imparts further reactivity to the surface. The electronic states near Fermi level (Fig. 1(d)) shows coupling of Co-3d orbitals with C-2p states, indicating the formation of covalent bond between Co and PG.The thermal stability of the Co@PG is investigated through molecular dynamics simulations (MD). The AIMD simulations are performed at 500 K for 6 ps with a time step of 1 fs. The potential energy varies around a certain magnitude suggesting that this system can with stand high temperatures up to 500 K.The potential energy diagram and geometry of Co@PG are illustrated in Figure S3. 3.2 Adsorption of H2 and CO2 over Co@PG For reduction of CO2, it is important to study the interactions between reactants (CO2 and H2) and catalyst i.e. Co@PG. Fig. 2 (a) shows the relaxed configuration of H2 after geometry optimization over the surface of catalyst. H2 is parallel to the surface in energetically favorable position making two equivalent bonds with bond length of 1.63 and 1.66 Å. The HH bond length increases by 0.21 Å in the adsorbed state due to charge transfer of 0.013 e from H2 to 3d orbitals of Co. Correspondingly the charge on Co decrease from 0.079 e to 0.052 e. This could be seen in electron density difference (EDD) diagram shown in Fig. 2. The lighter green region is electronic accumulation over Co while yellow region over H2 shows electropositive nature of it. The PDOS plot (Fig. 2) also shows coupling of H2-σ orbitals with empty 3d states of Co near Fermi level. The σ state of H2 almost vanishes due to hybridization. The appearance of local state at 2 eV shows back bonding of filled 3d orbitals with H2-σ* states. The adsorption energy happens to be exceptionally high which is −0.80 eV, indicating the strong capture and activation of hydrogen molecule for further reaction. CO2 adsorbs at the surface through C and one O atom in a bent configuration (Fig. 2(b)) as reported previously for such surfaces. The interactions are stronger due to the angle strain of CO2 from 180° to 145.35° in the adsorbed state with adsorption energy of −1.09 eV. As a result, small lengthening of C–O bonds occurs from 1.17Å to 1.26 and 1.19 Å. Electron Density Difference (EDD) diagram in Fig. 2 shows electron accumulation region over oxygen (light green) while some depleted regions on Co (yellow).The net atomic charge on Co decreases by 0.008e due to donation of lone pairs of O to empty d orbitals of Co. The Hirshfeld analysis confirms charge transfer of 0.043 e from Co to CO2 as net atomic charge on Co decreases by 0.021e. It is also evident from PDOS plots (Fig. 2) that weaker hybridization occurs near Fermi level between 3d orbitals of Co and highest occupied molecular orbitals of CO2. The intensity of later orbitals decreases with downshifts to more negative energies. The magnetic moment of the system drops due to pairing of electrons. To study the mechanism of reduction, it is necessary to adsorb both H2 and CO2 simultaneously over the surface of catalyst. The most stable co-adsorbed configuration is shown in Fig. 2(c). Both reactants are strongly attached to Co on the surface as indicated by very high adsorption energy of −2.57 eV compared to sum of individual adsorption energies of CO2 and H2 (−1.89 eV). The mutual polarization of both reactants induces strong interactions with the surface as shown by EDD analysis. A substantial accumulation of electronic density can be seen between these atoms in Fig. 2. These findings are supplemented by the PDOS plots (Fig. 2) where there is significant change in orbital interactions between reactants and the surface in adsorbed state as compared to their individual interactions with the surface. The co-adsorption is also characterized by negative ∆H298 (−2.48 eV) and ∆G298 (−2.41 eV) values suggesting thermodynamically feasible nature of the process at room temperature. The comparison of ∆H298 and Eads also shows a small difference as temperature has negligible effect on the process (Table 1 ). 3.3 Reaction mechanism for CO2 hydrogenation The favorable pathway for hydrogenation of CO2 over Co@PG is through formate intermediate as evident from previous studies on other surfaces. Carboxyl pathway is inhibited by higher activation energy of H2 splitting into atomic hydrogen. Figs. 3 and 4 shows the optimized stationary points and energy profile diagram for hydrogenation of CO2 over Co@PG. The process starts with co-adsorption of CO2 and H2 with Co of the surface. This is indicated by IS-1 (initial state-1). The IS-1 passes through a mild barrier of 0.12 eV as shown by transition state (TS-1) to produce formate intermediate. In TS-1, one of the hydrogen atoms of H2 gets closer to C of CO2, elongating the CoC bond length to 2.34 Å from 1.92 Å. The H2 bond length is also stretched to 1.41 Å from 0.81Å and finally attachment occurs which leads to the formation of formate group on the surface. The formate intermediate is attached to the surface through O atom as seen in intermediate state (IM-1). A net charge transfer of 0.21 e occur from the surface to formate group and magnetic moment of the system is zero. The activation energy is considerably small (0.12 eV) and this transition could easily occur at room temperature. The process is also exothermic in nature releasing −0.18 eV energy. In the next step, IM-1 is converted to final state-1 (FS-1) through transition state-2 (TS-2). The formate group attaches second hydrogen from the surface by slightly turning its CO1 bond. A small amount of energy i.e. 0.29 eV is required to overcome this barrier. This step is also exothermic in nature releasing −0.89 eV energy. Notably, this is the rate-determining step for hydrogenation of CO2 over Co@PG and the energy barrier is very small compared to other surfaces like Ni (0.62 eV) [5] and nitrogen doped graphene (0.32 eV) [5]. This small activation barrier indicates that the process is not even fast but is easily feasible at room temperature. Moreover, formic acid could easily be desorbed from the surface as its adsorption energy is −0.47 eV. Table 2 shows the comparative analysis of the energy barrier for the rate-determining step for CO2 reduction over Co@PG catalyst with earlier reported catalysts. Another important competing pathway is the formation of CO and H2O instead of formic acid. The corresponding stationary points are shown in Fig. 5 . This pathway also starts with co-adsorption of the reactants i.e. CO2 and H2. The reaction then passes through a huge barrier of 1.14 eV (Fig. 6 ) in transition state 3 (TS-3) where CoH2 and CO1 bonds are elongated. These bonds are then broken to produce intermediate 2 (IM-2) where reacting moieties are still chemisorbed on the surface. For the production of CO and H2O, the reaction passes through another barrier of 0.62 eV in transition state 4 (TS-4). Here, CoH1 bond is broken down while O1 H1 bond is formed. Finally, CO and H2O are produced on the surface in final state 2 (FS-2) with total adsorption energy of −1.87 eV. This indicates that desorption of these products is difficult at room temperature. Hence, it is concluded that this pathway is superseded by the formate pathway which is feasible at room temperature and require less energy for desorption of products. 3.4 Effect of carbon monoxide (CO) Carbon monoxide (CO) is considered a major interfering species in hydrogenation of CO2; therefore, its reduction is also necessary to be investigated on the same surface. As shown in Fig. 7 , the reaction starts with co-adsorption of CO and H2 molecules on Co@PG. The adsorption is characterized by −2.34 eV adsorption energy (E ad) showing strong interaction between Co and reactants (CO and H2). The reaction proceeds through transition state 5 (TS-5) which requires a huge activation energy of 1.98 eV (Fig. 8 ). During this transition, H2 bond is broken down while CH1 bond is formed. This elongates CO bond by 1.87 Å and OCo link is also established in intermediate 3 (IM-3). In the next step, the CHO moiety is converted to formaldehyde molecule through transition state 6 (TS-6). The activation energy for this conversion is also very high (1.83 eV) compared to formate formation. The adsorption energy of formaldehyde over Co@PG is −1.53 eV. It indicates that the desorption process at ambient temperature is not feasible. It is noteworthy that CO chemisorb on Co@PG (E ad = −1.69) and will cover the active sites easily compared to CO2. Therefore, interference is necessary to happen but due to larger energy barrier the CO hydrogenation reaction is harder over the Co@PG then CO2 hydrogenation reaction. 4 Conclusions The above findings through DFT simulations could be summarized as cobalt incorporated penta-graphene (Co@PG) can act as efficient single atom catalyst (SAC) for the reduction of CO2. The adsorption energies shows that the Co atom is strongly anchored over the PG surface. While the molecular electrostatic potential map and spin density analysis demonstrates that the Co atom of the Co@PG surface is the most active site for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. The hydrogenation of CO2 over Co@PG is more feasible and can occur at ambient temperature. The reaction follows formate pathway where small activation energy of 0.29 eV is needed to overcome the barrier. The formation of H2O and CO2 instead of HCOOH is prohibited by large activation energy and endothermic nature of the process. Although CO is chemisorbed on Co@PG but its conversion to formaldehyde is difficult at room temperature due to large barrier of 1.98 eV. This study would be helpful in the experimental synthesis of novel single atom catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO2.

        "dc:description": "Hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (CO2) to formic acid is explored through density functional theory calculations over Co decorated penta-graphene (Co@PG) as single atom catalyst (SAC). Co is successfully stabilized over pentagraphene due to strong overlapping of Co-3d and C-2p states of pentagonal ring of pentagraphene near fermi level. The higher diffusion barrier for Co over pentagraphene evince that the clustering of Co atom is restricted. This suggests that Co@PG can be used as a catalyst for reducing CO2. Moreover, the Hirshfeld charge density, molecular electrostatic potential and spin density analysis indicates that the Co site is the highly active site for CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Both CO2 and H2 show strong interaction with Co@PG. In co-adsorbed state, the interactions are even larger due to greater mutual polarization of reactants and localization of positive charge on Co with adsorption energy of -2.57 eV. The hydrogenation can proceed at ambient temperature due to a small energy barrier of 0.29 eV, the competitive reaction i.e. CO hydrogenation with CO2 hydrogenations almost impossible over the catalyst surface due to larger energy barriers i.e. 1.98 eV. Thus, this work shows that Co@PG can be used as an efficient and promising catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation at room temperature.",
