Graphical abstract Insight into metal-support interactions at the nanoscale is of prominent significance in the development of efficient catalysts for volatile organic compound (VOC) abatement. This study investigates catalysts with distinct Pt active centers including Pt nanoparticles (PtNP) and single-atom Pt (Pt1) supported on Mn-Co3O4 and reveals their electronic metal-support interaction characteristics. Benzene combustion tests show a contrasting trend exhibited by these two representative samples. Characterization techniques confirm that the superior performance of PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 stems from promotive electronic interaction. The effective charge transfer enhances reducibility and oxygen activation, coupled with the excellent benzene adsorption capacity of PtNP. However, the inhibitive role of Pt1 in Mn-Co3O4 hinders the lattice oxygen mobility and leads to undesirable performance. Mechanistic insights elucidate the EMSI-induced benefits of being less prone to surface species poisoning, along with detailed reaction mechanisms and benzene decomposition route. This EMSI-dependent understanding of benzene combustion behavior offers valuable insights into the rational design of Pt-based catalysts for benzene abatement.

Thus, the removal of benzene from industrial exhaust is of paramount importance. After decades of elaboration, catalytic combustion outperforms the other strategies, such as adsorption, incineration, and biodegradation [3,4], and gradually appeals to researchers due to the low operating temperature and less byproduct generation. Among VOC-abatement catalysts, Pt-based catalysts with high activity and durability have attracted greater attention [5]. However, shortcomings such as insufficient light-off temperature and scarcity of Pt still hindered the application, and the development of efficient VOC-abatement catalysts is high on the agenda. Studies focusing on the physicochemical interaction between noble metal entities and metal oxide support have been extensively investigated and can be categorized into traditional strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) and electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI). The former mainly focuses on the encapsulation of metal by support materials, such as Pt nanoparticles (NPs) interacting with Co3O4 and TiO2 [6,7]. This encapsulation phenomenon could greatly enhance the catalytic performance by enlarging the active metal-support interface [8]. As for the other one, charge transfer and the following surface modification are the characteristics of EMSI. Reducible metal oxides such as Fe2O3, CeO2, and TiO2 can electronically interact with supported Pt NPs [9–11]. Specifically, this electronic interaction can be classified into two kinds, one is electron transfer from metal to support and the other one is from support to metal. Electrons from Pt NPs transfer to perimeter sites of support and induce the reduction of support accompanied by oxygen vacancy formation, which enhances the mobility of surface lattice oxygen species in the vicinity of Pt NPs site and as the secondary reactive oxygen species participating in the oxidation reaction [9]. This can be interpreted as the metal-assisted Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in the relevant literature [12]. As for the other one, the disparity in work functions or electronegativities between Pt and support could result in an electron-enriched state of Pt NP sites and thus promote the adsorption and activation process [11,13]. Apart from metallic nanoparticles, supported single-atom noble metal catalysts with the maximal utilization of noble metals became prominent right after the “single-atom catalysis” proposed by Zhang’s report [14]. However, the SMSI in supported single-atom catalysts is unique and distinct from what is observed in metal nanoparticles. Qiao’s report insights into the SMSI in supported single-atom catalysts. The encapsulation is not observed through the high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and low energy ion scattering characterizations and the SMSI between Pt1 and support stems from the coordination saturation of Pt [7]. Furthermore, the size of the single-atom site makes it cannot work as an individual active center, and the oxidation process over single-atom catalysts is highly dependent on the support material [15–17]. Thus the EMSI is more pronounced in the applications of supported Pt1 catalysts. During electronic interaction with the support, the metal-O bond on the Pt1-support interface would be longer than the pristine one, resulting in a more active lattice oxygen species [18]. From the viewpoint of energy band theory, the higher depletion of the d electronic state of the noble metal atoms causes stronger electronic metal-support interactions, which induces enhanced reducibility and catalytic performance [19,20]. Metal support interactions mentioned above function by altering the local geometric or electronic configurations and also benefit some C1 conversion reactions with respect to reactants’ adsorption behavior. EMSI of Pt/CeO2 has been taken in the methane dry reforming reaction to avoid carbon deposition on Pt sites by dissociating CO2 on Ce3+ generated through EMSI [21]. The as-generated oxygen vacancy site with its localized negative charge or electron-rich environment can attract the partially positively charged carbon atom in CO2 and become the possible CO2 adsorption/activation site in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction [22–24]. Moreover, single-atom catalysis is also well-applied in C1 conversion reactions, in that the efficient activation of these basic C1 molecules [25]. The electron-enriched Zn atoms triggered by the electron donor of ZrO2 support can also promote CO2 adsorption in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol [26]. Single-atom Pt supported on CeO2-δ/MgO is well-responded to the water–gas shift reaction from CO oxidation by Pt1 as CO adsorption site and H2O dissociating at as-generated oxygen vacancy site [27]. By taking great advantage of the EMSI, the selectivity of specific reactions/products can be well controlled. However, it is critical to explore the most beneficial EMSI effect for a specific reaction. Debates have arisen among these two different active centers, especially in the benzene combustion reaction. Some researchers rationalize metallic Pt NPs from different aspects. Liu’s work demonstrates the importance of frontier band orbitals and Pt NPs with the lowest energy barrier between the lowest unoccupied band orbitals and the highest occupied band orbitals can transfer electrons from benzene to O2 more readily thus promoting catalytic performance [28]. From the perspective of absorbate binding capacity, Pt NPs with high surface charge density can adsorb and activate reactant molecules more effectively [29]. This enhancement is attributed to the hybridization between the d-orbitals of Pt and the π-orbitals of the reactants. Others contend that single-atom noble metal species with unique metal-support interactions and superior oxygen storage capacity fit more for VOC combustion reactions through similar explanations of oxygen vacancy formation [17,18]. However, insights into the electronic interactions between the same support and the same kind of metal, and how they affect the benzene combustion behavior are still hindered by the non-uniform of Pt active centers from the synthesis procedures. This knowledge gap greatly impeded the rational design of Pt-based catalysts. In this study, Co3O4 doped with Mn ions in its bulk is chosen as the support material because it not only can retain a Co-accessible surface in that the higher surface energy of Mn oxide than that of Co3O4, but provides an enhanced surface lattice mobility due to the weakened Co-O bonding, as presented in our published work [30]. We control the synthesis method and successfully obtain two types of catalysts: one with metallic Pt nanoparticles deposited and the other one supported single-atom Pt entities. A comparative study between these two different Pt active sites has been carried out. Firstly, we systematically analyze the geometric and electronic structures of both samples by various characterization technologies. And correlates the distinction in catalytic performance with distinct EMSI based on experimental results. Finally, the mechanistic insights of the benzene combustion mechanism and decomposition route are revealed by partial pressure dependence experiments and in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Analyzing these representative Pt entities offers valuable comparative information on how the metal-support interactions govern the benzene combustion reaction behavior and may guide the designing principle of efficient VOC-abatement catalysts. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Synthesis of the catalysts The Mn-Co3O4 support was synthesized utilizing a solvothermal method. During this process, 17.43 g of CoC4H6O4·4H2O was combined with a specified quantity of MnC4H6O4·4H2O and thoroughly dissolved in 210 mL of ethylene glycol. Subsequently, the mixture was heated to 170 °C with magnetic stirring for 2 h. Concurrently, 13.44 g of (NH4)2CO3 was dissolved in 700 mL of deionized water to formulate an alkaline precipitating agent. This solution of (NH4)2CO3 was injected into the ethylene glycol mixture at a flow rate of 7 mL min−1 under constant stirring for a duration of 1.5 h. The resultant mixture was then filtered and washed multiple times before undergoing a calcination process. This calcination was performed at 350 °C for 2 h in an air atmosphere with a temperature increase of 5 °C min−1. The PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 catalyst (NP denotes nanoparticle) was synthesized through a conventional wet impregnation technique using NaBH4 as the reducing agent. A defined volume of H2PtCl6·6H2O solution was introduced to a dispersion of Mn-Co3O4 in deionized water. A solution comprising NaBH4 and NaOH was added to this dispersion under magnetic stirring. Following centrifugation and drying, the resulting solid was calcined in a muffle furnace at 400 °C for 2 h. The PtNP/Fe2O3 catalyst was synthesized using a wet impregnation method with NaBH4 as the reducing agent. A desired amount of H2PtCl6·6H2O solution to a mixture containing Fe2O3 dispersed in deionized water. After stirring the mixture for 10 min, a desired amount of NaBH4 was dissolved in deionized water and added to the mixture under magnetic stirring for an additional 10 min. Following centrifugation and drying, the resulting solid was calcined in a muffle furnace at 400 °C for 2 h. The Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 catalyst (where '1′ represents a single atom) was synthesized using the strong electrostatic adsorption method. A specific quantity of Pt(NO3)2 solution was added to a mixture containing Mn-Co3O4 dispersed in a dilute ammonia aqueous solution at an injection rate of 1 mL h−1 under magnetic stirring. After centrifugation and washing, the obtained solid was dried in a vacuum oven. Subsequently, the material underwent a calcination process at 350 °C for 2 h. All of the chemicals (A.R. in purity) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd and used without further purification. 2.2 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were employed to characterize the structure, physical properties, and chemical properties of the as-synthesized catalysts. Please see the Supporting Information for more details. 2.3 Catalytic performance evaluation The benzene catalytic combustion performance of the catalysts was conducted within a fixed-bed quartz tube reactor containing 100 mg of catalyst in a mixed gas flow of 500 ppm benzene, 10 vol% O2, and balanced with N2 achieving the total flow rate of 100 mL min−1, corresponding to a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 60,000 mL g−1 h−1. Prior to reaction, all catalyst samples were pretreated at 200 °C for 1 h under a 100 mL min−1 flow of N2 to eliminate surface impurities. The concentrations of reactants and products were monitored and recorded using an online gas chromatograph (Fuli GC-9790) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Characterizations of as-synthesized catalysts The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to unveil the crystal structure of Mn-Co3O4 and deposited Pt entities. Fig. S1 shows that six strong diffraction peaks were observed for all the as-synthesized catalysts, located at 2 theta angles of 31.3, 36.9, 44.8, 55.6, 59.4, and 65.3°. These peaks stay the same with the standard structure of cubic Co3O4 (JCPDS PDF #43–1003) and can be attributed to the crystal planes of Co3O4(220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440), respectively, indicating that the successful synthesis of single-component Mn-Co3O4 as a consequence of a low Mn: Co ratio without a phase separation of MnCO3 and Co3O4 reported in other cases [30]. As for deposited Pt entities, no diffraction peaks can be detected, which could be assigned to the high dispersion of Pt species below the XRD detection limit. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and HRTEM images show the Mn-Co3O4 morphology in Fig. S2a, a distinctive fiber-like shape was observed with lengths and widths ranging from 40 ∼ 150 nm and 8 ∼ 12 nm. Typical facets of Co3O4 crystal were picked out and identified in Fig. S2b. A lattice fringe consistent with the Co3O4(110) extending to the projected surface of the fiber-shaped nano-crystallites, indicating that the (110) facet presents as one of the extended surface terminations on the Mn-Co3O4. The Co3O4(311) with a lattice fringe of 0.24 nm was also detected with an interfacial angle of 64° to the projected surface termination of the (011) facet, demonstrating the (011) facet also as one of the exposed facets. Furthermore, the measured lattice fringes of Mn-Co3O4 aligned with that of Co3O4 also indicate the doping of Mn atoms does not break the single component of Mn-Co3O4, which is in line with the XRD analysis. High-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and HRTEM images of Fig. 1 provide the deposited Pt entities’ nanostructures. Due to the diffusion effect of the electron beam in HAADF-STEM imaging mode, the intensity of a given atom is approximately proportional to its Z 2 (where Z is the atomic number), with a brighter contrast for heavier atoms. In this case, Pt with the atomic number of 78 is heavier than that of Co, Mn, or O, thus the brighter spots prove the existence of Pt entities. The statistic analysis of the brighter entities in the insert of Fig. 1a indicates the main particle size of 1.6 nm. Besides, the HRTEM insert of Fig. 1a identified the Pt nanoparticle with the 0.22-nm lattice fringe of Pt(111). Thus, the catalyst depositing Pt nanoparticles denotes as PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 (NP stands for the nanoparticle). The actual content of Pt was 0.5 wt%, determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The single-atom Pt deposited catalyst was synthesized by an electrostatic adsorption method [31]. Due to the strong electrostatic adsorption and low theoretical loading amount of Pt, atomically dispersed Pt is possible. In the aberration-corrected STEM image shown in Fig. 1b, bright spots of atomic size scattered across the lattice fringes of Co3O4 have been identified and marked with red circles. Each spot represents an isolated Pt atom in STEM mode. The HAADF-STEM image shown in Fig. 1b confirms the perfect atomic dispersion of Pt on Mn-Co3O4 surface. The Co3+ cation vacancies on exposed facets of Co3O4 can provide locations for Pt-atom-anchoring due to the typical p-type semiconductor of Co3O4 [17]. Furthermore, the additional aberration-corrected STEM images in Fig. S3 demonstrated that the bright spots of Pt atoms (marked by red circles) stay in line with Co atoms, which means the position of Pt is not shifted from the expected vacancies of Co atoms. Therefore, the catalyst containing single-atom Pt could be designated as Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 (1 here represents isolated Pt single atom) hereafter. The actual content of Pt was 0.2 wt%, determined by ICP-OES. Fourier transform IR spectroscopy (FTIR) with carbon monoxide as a probe molecule is a powerful site-specific characterization technique and is widely used for insights into the atomic and electronic structures of platinum group metals [32,33]. The disparity of vibrational frequencies of CO linearly adsorbed on Pt sites with distinct electronic states makes the identification of Pt NPs from Pt1 possible. Electron microscopy coupled with in situ FTIR technology has been reported as an effective and comprehensive method to identify Pt NPs and Pt1 [31]. Prior to this experiment, the possibility of CO adsorption on Mn-Co3O4 has been ruled out. As shown in Fig. S4, only two bands located at 2175 and 2115 cm−1 assigned to gas phase CO were observed over Mn-Co3O4 in the CO-enriched environment. No sign of CO can be detected after N2 purging, demonstrating that Mn-Co3O4 barely contributes to the CO-FTIR spectra features of catalysts depositing different Pt entities. Thus, the spectral features of subsequent Fig. 1c and d are subject to CO molecules adsorbed on different Pt entities. Fig. 1c and d record the behavior of CO linearly adsorbed on PtNP and Pt1-deposited catalysts. The IR spectra of the PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 catalyst showed a prominent peak located at 2081 cm−1. According to previous research, IR bands assigned to CO molecule linearly adsorbed on metallic Pt sites (Ptmetal) falling in the range of 2070–2085 cm−1, which could be affected by the charge transfer between Pt and support and the coordination number of adsorbed Pt site [32,34]. Furthermore, the noticeable coverage-dependent chemical shift triggered by dipole–dipole interaction between adsorbed CO molecules is prevailing in Pt NPs. The Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 catalyst shows a single well-defined peak located at 2098 cm−1, which could be assigned to CO molecules linearly adsorbed on isolated Pt atoms (Ptiso), based on previous literature [35]. Compared to CO adsorbed on Ptmetal sites, the CO-IR bands of Pt1 tend to exhibit in the higher wavenumber region. The more positive oxidation state of Pt1, which leads to the partial depopulation of Pt 5d orbitals, would reduce electron back-donation from Pt to 2π* antibonding orbital of the CO molecule [33,36]. Furthermore, the coverage-dependent feature shows that the peak position does not shift during the N2 purging process. This phenomenon occurs exclusively when CO molecules are linearly adsorbed onto Pt single-atom sites. The underlying reason is associated with the CO adsorption behavior on Pt atoms: the absence of dipole–dipole interactions between adjacent CO molecules, and each CO molecule adsorbing onto an individual Pt site. Due to the spatial separation of Pt1 atoms, no adjacent CO molecules are present to vibrate in unison, which would otherwise cause a coverage-dependent shift. 3.2 Electronic properties of as-synthesized catalysts CO-FTIR experiments revealed the distinct electronic states of PtNP sites and Pt1 sites. Typically, noble metal deposits could interact with reducible metal oxide support materials through EMSI, thereby affecting the chemical properties of samples. In this section, we use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to reveal the changes in the surface composition and chemical state of the catalysts. Fig. 2 a shows the Co 2p spectra of as-prepared samples, featuring spin–orbit doublets (Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2) and corresponding shakeup satellites. We found that the Co 2p spectra of PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 and Mn-Co3O4 show minimal differences. However, Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 exhibits a higher proportion of Co2+. This could be attributed to the fact that Pt1 donates electrons to Co. In most cases, Pt transfers electrons to Co via oxygen bridges, leading to a reduction in the oxidation state of more Co atoms. In contrast, in Pt NP, only a portion of the interface Pt atoms donate electrons to Co. This partial electron transfer is not prominently reflected in the Co XPS results. Nevertheless, the XPS results of Pt (Fig. 2b) indicate that Pt exhibits a partially positive oxidation state and partially metallic state. Pt 4f spectra are investigated and presented in Fig. 3 b. For the PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 catalyst, the spectra are best fitted by the existence of Pt0 and Pt2+ species with a ratio of 1:2. This demonstrates that the Pt entities contain both metallic Pt and oxidized Pt2+, with the oxidized Pt2+ likely located at the interface. This observation is consistent with what is expected for face-centered small cubic (fcc) Pt nanoparticles (see Fig. 1a). In the Pt1/Mn-Co3O4, the Pt 4f spectrum can be resolved into contributions from Pt2+ and Pt4+ species. Notably, the Pt 4f5/2 peak associated with Pt4+ is observed at a higher binding energy of 77.3 eV. XPS analysis reveals a Pt2+/Pt4+ ratio of 9:2, suggesting a predominance of the Pt2+ state. The variance in binding energies among these site-isolated Pt species reflects differences in their local chemical environments. According to the literature, Pt2+ in the Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 catalyst is predominantly less oxidized, situated adjacent to Co2+ ions and oxygen vacancies (Ov). Conversely, the Pt4+ species maintain a higher oxidation state within a stable Pt1O4 coordination matrix [37]. Doping Mn can affect the electronic structure of Co3O4, wherein Mn2+ occupies the tetrahedral position in the Co3O4 cell with a low spin state, while Mn3+ and Mn4+ occupy the octahedral position in the cell with a high spin state. The interaction between Co3+ and Mn3+ (Co3+ + Mn3+ → Co2+ + Mn4+) could promote the electron transfer from Mn to Co, leading to an overall decrease in Co valence states of all samples [40], and causing the valence states of Co lower than the reference value of 779.7 eV, the Co 2p3/2 peak in undoped Co3O4 [40]. Additionally, no significant difference could be observed in the normalized Mn 2p spectra in Fig. S5, suggesting that Mn cannot interact with Pt in Pt-deposited catalysts. This is due to Mn oxides having higher surface energy relative to Co3O4, which drives Co atoms to the surface, as demonstrated in our previous work [30]. Mn doping primarily occurs in bulk sites rather than blocking surface sites, creating a geometry that stabilizes a Co-accessible atom catalyst surface. The local structure of as-prepared catalysts can be further investigated by Raman spectra. As shown in Fig. S6, five typical Co3O4-related peaks at 186, 478, 517, 613, and 671 cm−1 are detected, and can be assigned to F2g 3, Eg, F2g 2, F2g 1, and A1g symmetries of cubic Co3O4 [30]. Among them, the peak at about 671 cm−1 corresponds to the vibration of Co3+–O2- belonging to the octahedral CoO6 configuration, and the band shift indicates the change of Co-O bond strength and thus associates with the variations in oxygen vacancy sites [8]. Upon deposition of Pt species, this peak exhibited distinct positive shifts compared to bare Mn-Co3O4, suggesting a reduction in overall vacancy concentration. A lower vacancy density typically leads to a more ordered lattice structure with shorter and stronger chemical bonds. In Pt1-deposited samples with increasing Pt loadings, the magnitude of the positive shift became more pronounced, likely due to partial occupation of surface defects by Pt single atoms. Similarly, in the case of PtNP/Mn-Co3O4, the deposition process of Pt NPs may inevitably occupy some vacancy sites. However, benefiting from the moderate EMSI, the weakened Co-O bond strength rendered the extra oxygen vacancy sites generated adjacent to Pt NPs leading to the redshift of spectrum and thus alleviated this decrement to some extent (Fig. S6). 3.3 Activation of oxygen species The XPS characterizations revealed surface chemical states of the catalysts were altered dramatically after depositing distinct Pt entities. This modification induced by electronic metal-support interaction could affect the catalysts’ ability to activate oxygen, which is of great importance in oxidation reactions. Thus, we identify and quantify the oxygen species over the catalysts’ surface using XPS, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), and O2 temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD). As shown in Fig. 3a, the O 1s spectra could be fitted to one main peak located at about 529.7 eV with shoulder feature resolved at about 531.7 and 533.0 eV, which could be assigned to lattice oxygen species (Olatt), surface oxygen species (Oads), and surface hydroxyl species (OOH) [41]. Among these, the surface oxygen species assumes the best reactivity in oxidation reactions. Thus, the relative abundance of Oads/Ototal according to the curve-fitting data is calculated and following the order of PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 (19.6%) > Mn-Co3O4 (15.2%) > Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 (14.8%), indicating the most Oads accumulated on PtNP/Mn-Co3O4. The H2-TPR profiles of Mn-Co3O4, PtNP/Mn-Co3O4, and Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 catalysts are depicted in Fig. 3b. Three major reduction peaks were observed for the Mn-Co3O4 support, the peak centered at about 160 °C could be assigned to the reduction of surface oxygen species (denoted as Os); the reduction peak of Co3O4 to CoO (designated as Ob1, where Ob stands for the bulk oxygen species) located at about 242 °C; and the reduction of CoO to metallic Co (represented as Ob2), peaked at 444 °C. Similarly, the H2-TPR profiles of Pt-deposited samples also contain three reduction peaks. However, the disparity in reduction temperatures may lie in the interaction triggered by Pt entities deposited. Over PtNP/Mn-Co3O4, the Os peak shifted to a lower temperature of 106 °C with a greater amount of reduction peak area compared to that of the Mn-Co3O4. This observation indicates that the surface oxygen species are more readily generated on the interfacial sites between PtNP and support through the EMSI-dependent lattice oxygen activation. In the case of Pt1/Mn-Co3O4, the first reduction feature at about 200 °C can be resolved into two peaks, with the Os peak centered at 188 °C. This peak shifts to a higher temperature range compared to the other samples, indicating that more energy is required for the reduction of surface oxygen species. This elevated energy requirement suggests an overly strong Pt-O bond, resulting in exceptionally stable lattice oxygen that is difficult to detach from the host [39]. The quantification of Os in Fig. S7 indicates that the Os of Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 centered at 188 °C with a reduced Os reduction feature of 19% in the integrated peak area compared to that of Mn-Co3O4 centered at 160 °C. This reduction suggests that the strong Pt-O bonding inhibits the process of Os reduction. The Os reduction peak in PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 centered at 106 °C increased by 21% in area compared to that of Mn-Co3O4 at 160 °C indicating that Pt NP can facilitate the surface oxygen activation by generating promotive EMSI with Mn-Co3O4 support. O2-TPD is conducted and shown in Fig. S8a, two types of oxygen species are detected. According to relevant literature [42,43], the first desorption peak in the range of 50–400 °C can be assigned to surface adsorbed oxygen adjacent to active sites (Oads); the second peak between 400 and 700 °C is characteristic of desorption of surface lattice oxygen (Olatt). Among these samples, PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 exhibited an Oads peak at 138 °C, which was at a lower temperature than the corresponding peaks for Mn-Co3O4 and Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 (297 and 317 °C). This suggests that the PtNP-deposited sample possesses more weakly bound oxygen species associated with Pt NPs. Additionally, the quantification analysis in Fig. S8b presents the most Oads desorption over PtNP/Mn-Co3O4. Benefiting from the electronic interaction between Pt NPs and support and the greater electron density over Pt NPs, PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 has more available Oads, leading to its superior reactivity. Moreover, the Oads desorption temperature of the Pt1-deposited sample is higher than that of the Mn-Co3O4. This indicates that the Oads is strongly bound on Pt1 and thus hinders the reactivity, probably due to the over-strong interaction between Pt1 and Mn-Co3O4. The highest reactive oxygen species coverage on PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 could come down to two main reasons. On the one hand, metallic Pt nanoparticles with a greater electron density could interact with gaseous O2 molecules more readily through the “back-donation effect”. Specifically, Pt with greater surface electron density can induce a larger extent of electron back-donation of d-electron from the zero-valence metal to the antibonding 2π* orbital of the O2 molecule when it is adsorbed on Pt surface [44]. The other one is the activation of adjacent lattice oxygen through promotive EMSI. The electron transferred from Pt NPs to support and activate lattice oxygen adjacent to Pt [11,38]. The reactive surface oxygen of Mn-Co3O4 might benefit from the doping of Mn. According to previously published work of our group, after doping Mn ion into the bulk phase of Co3O4, Mn-O bonding is stronger than that of Co-O, resulting in a weaker bonding of Co-O [30]. Thus, the O atom can detach from the host, becoming the activated oxygen species. In the case of Pt1/Mn-Co3O4, the inhibitive effect of Pt1 species might be due to the coordination of saturated Pt1 species and the interaction between Pt and Mn-Co3O4 support through the formation of the stable [Pt1O4] complex [39]. A stronger bonding of Pt-O rendered the O atom hard to detach from the host and become the activation status. 3.4 Adsorption of benzene Apart from oxygen activation, we use temperature programmed-desorption of benzene (Benzene-TPD) to insight into the different adsorption sites of as-prepared samples and their corresponding adsorptive capacity. As presented in Fig. 4 a, all the samples showed at least one observable benzene desorption peak. The desorption feature occurring at a lower temperature range is ascribed to the weak adsorption of benzene from the Co3+ site (α); the high-temperature desorption feature is associated with the strong adsorption from the PtNP or Pt1 site (β1 or β2). The desorption feature of Mn-Co3O4 is single-state with a peak located at about 205 °C. Co3+ sites are abundant on the surface of Mn-Co3O4, which act as the benzene adsorption site reported in the literature [17]. The quantification of Benzene-TPD profiles shown in Fig. 4b indicates that the overall desorption amount of benzene increased by 49% in PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 compared to bare Mn-Co3O4. In contrast, the Pt1-deposited catalyst exhibited a 22% decrease. Additionally, the quantification of desorption features associated with Pt sites reveals that PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 shows a 45% increase, surpassing that of its Pt1 counterpart. The observed reductions in benzene desorption for Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 can be explained by two factors: on the one hand, the deposition of Pt1 species diminishes the availability of surface Co3+ ions, resulting in a significant decline in the first desorption peak; and the other one is the Pt1 species interact unfavorably with benzene due to their lower surface charge density. The greater surface electron density can enable a stronger back-donation effect through metal-to-π* benzene orbitals [45]. Specifically, when benzene molecules come into contact with Pt atoms, the 5d orbitals of Pt hybridize with the antibonding π* orbitals of benzene, allowing d-electrons to back-donate to the π* orbitals of benzene. Pt NPs sites with higher surface electron density may lead to a stronger back-donation effect, resulting in a greater affinity with benzene molecules. This result corresponds to earlier theoretical studies, which have demonstrated that the adsorption of benzene through noble metal–carbon bonds exhibits higher affinity compared to the adsorption onto oxygen-enriched oxidized noble metal species through oxygen-hydrogen bonds [46]. Furthermore, the desorption profiles of CO2 during the benzene-TPD experiments are shown in Fig. S9, which were generated simultaneously in the oxidation process of the adsorbed benzene. The peaks of CO2 recorded at 379–410 °C were due to the reaction products of adsorbed benzene species and surface oxygen species. Meanwhile, the peaks of CO2 recorded at about 540 °C were associated with the interaction of the adsorbed benzene and lattice oxygen species, indicating the involvement of lattice oxygen in the oxidation process. 3.5 Kinetic study To insight into the reaction mechanism of Pt-deposited samples, kinetic experiments of benzene combustion were conducted. The experiments were to calculate the reaction rates by varying the partial pressure of reactants and benzene conversion was controlled typically below 20 % to eliminate mass and heat transfer limitations. The benzene combustion rate as a function of partial pressures of reactants (C6H6 and O2) are shown in Fig. S10, and all the partial pressures will be presented within brackets for clarity (e.g., [C6H6] and [O2]). As shown in Fig. S10a, the PtNP/Mn-Co3O4′s reaction rate increased in the low benzene pressure region followed by a decrease at high benzene pressure, and the reaction rate gradually increased with the increasing O2 partial pressure. To obtain the direct linear relationship between the reaction rate and partial pressure of reactants, the results for the logarithm of these variations are shown in Fig. 5 a. The reaction rate exhibited first-order (gradient of 1.27 ± 0.03) followed by a negative order (gradient of −0.53 ± 0.04) dependence on [C6H6] (measured at a constant 1.0 vol% O2), and a non-integer-order (gradient of 0.78 ± 0.05) dependence on [O2] (measured at a constant 0.05 vol% benzene). The measured first-order of [C6H6] is aligned with the previous report about benzene combustion on Pt NP sites [47]. The observed negative order of benzene at high benzene partial pressure region is a signature of the single-site Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, which proposes two reactant molecules co-adsorbed on the same type of site. This competitive adsorption behavior could hinder the oxidation reaction and lead to a decrease in reaction rate [27]. However, the negative order of −0.53 is higher than the theoretical value of −1, meaning that the poisoning effect induced by higher benzene concentrations is alleviated. The underlying reason could be the participation of interfacial sites, which involve the excess lattice oxygen species adjacent to Pt sites activated by EMSI reacting with reaction intermediates adsorbed on Pt sites. This non-integer reaction order of O2 indicates the involvement of multiple reactive oxygen species. According to previous publications, an O2 molecule adsorbed on PtNP sites can dissociate into two reactive oxygen (O*) in two adjacent Pt atoms, which renders a 1/2 order of [O2] [27]. The other scenario could be the participation of oxygen vacancies adjacent to PtNP sites. Specifically, the interaction between PtNP and support alters the mobility of lattice oxygen, inducing the oxygen to detach from the host. The leftover oxygen vacancy is replenished by the gaseous O2. This whole process can trigger a 1 order of [O2] [48]. This combined mechanism rationalizes the 0.78 order of [O2] [44]. The oxidation behavior of benzene on PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 could be proposed. Specifically, benzene molecules adsorbed on PtNP surface react with O* from the dissociation of gaseous O2 on PtNP sites and the detachment of lattice oxygen adjacent to Pt, which makes the PtNP as the primary reactive site in PtNP/Mn-Co3O4. In the Pt1/Mn-Co3O4, the trend is similar to that observed in PtNP/Mn-Co3O4. However, at higher benzene concentrations, the reaction rate becomes independent of changes in benzene partial pressure, maintaining a roughly constant rate (Fig. S10b). Similarly, we logarithmize these variations, and the following linear relationships are shown in Fig. 5b. The reaction rate exhibited first-order (gradient of 1.32 ± 0.13) followed by a nearly zero-order (gradient of −0.12 ± 0.01) dependence on [C6H6] (measured at a constant 1.0 vol% O2), and a first-order (gradient of 1.00 ± 0.12) dependence on [O2] (measured at a constant 0.05 vol% benzene). The disparity in benzene reaction orders in lower benzene partial pressure regimes implies the variations in benzene adsorption ability as the complementary of Benzene-TPD results. The higher benzene reaction order of Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 indicates lower benzene coverage on the surface compared to its PtNP counterpart, the less available d-electrons on Pt1 sites make it less favorable for benzene adsorption. The reaction order result also implies a distinct reaction mechanism of benzene oxidation experienced over the Pt1-deposited sample. The variations in benzene reaction order dependence from first-order to zero-order accompanied by changes in benzene partial pressure portrait that sufficient benzene adsorption sites gradually become saturated, and the measured zero-order dependence suggest the absence of competitive adsorption between benzene and O2 molecules on Pt1/Mn-Co3O4. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism with dual-site is more applicable. Specifically, this reaction model involves two kinds of different sites that can independently adsorb benzene and O2 to avoid competition. Besides, the measured first-order dependence of oxygen indicates the possible involvement of oxygen vacancy adjacent to benzene adsorption sites (e.g. Co3+ or Pt1 site as presented in Fig. 4). The plausible benzene oxidation behavior over Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 can be described as follows: the surface lattice oxygen was first been activated and became O* to react with benzene adsorbed on Co3+ and Pt1 sites, and then the gaseous O2 adsorbed on this oxygen vacancy site followed by the gradual dissociation abovementioned to generate O* participating into further oxidation process. The E-R mechanism is widely expected among VOC combustion reactions over supported noble metal catalysts between adsorbed VOC molecules reacting with gaseous O2 molecules [49]. According to the dual-molecule reaction over Pt1 site experiencing E-R mechanism, the kinetic characteristics include either a first or zero order of O2 and a first order of VOC [27], which involves adsorbed O* reacting with gas-phase VOC molecules and resembles those of the dual-site L-H mechanism. However, the benzene adsorption behavior of Pt1 is evidenced by the Benzene-TPD-MS profile (Fig. 4), and the corresponding CO2 desorption profile of Benzene-TPD-MS shown in Fig. S9 verified the reactivity of lattice oxygen species which can be replenished by gaseous O2 in oxygen-containing conditions. Hence, the dual-site L-H mechanism is more plausible and the significance of the E-R mechanism in Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 has been diminished. Additionally, we investigated the kinetic dependencies for C6H6 under a high O2 concentration of 10 vol% O2. As shown in Fig. S11, negative reaction orders for [C6H6] in the PtNP- and Pt1-deposited catalysts suggest the saturation of surface active sites and intensified competitive adsorption under high reactant concentrations. Notably, the partial pressure dependencies at 10 vol% O2 differ significantly from those recorded under a feed gas containing 1.0 vol% O2. Specifically, the PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 catalyst exhibits a reaction order of −0.37 at 10 vol% O2, which is lower than the −0.53 observed at 1.0 vol% O2. In contrast, the Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 catalyst demonstrates a reaction order of −0.21 at 10 vol% O2, compared to −0.12 at 1.0 vol% O2. This opposing trend can be attributed to their distinct EMSI behaviors. In the PtNP-deposited sample, the generated oxygen vacancy sites adjacent to Pt facilitate the activation of additional gaseous O2 molecules as the concentration increases from 1 to 10 vol%, leading to enhanced oxidation processes and a lower benzene reaction order. Conversely, in Pt1/Mn-Co3O4, the strong Pt-O bonding (as evidenced by XPS and H2-TPR) stabilizes the [Pt1O4] coordination structure, which suppresses oxygen vacancy generation and restricts lattice oxygen mobility. At elevated O2 concentrations (10 vol%), the limited availability of oxygen vacancies hinders efficient O2 activation, while gaseous O2 molecules increasingly compete with benzene for adsorption on some same active sites (e.g., Co3+). This intensified competitive adsorption, combined with the inherently weaker benzene adsorption capacity of Pt1 species (Fig. 4), results in a more pronounced negative reaction order (−0.21 at 10 vol% O2 vs. −0.12 at 1 vol% O2). The enhanced O2 coverage further diminishes the accessibility of benzene to active sites, thereby exacerbating the inhibitory effect under high O2 conditions. 3.6 Catalytic performance of benzene combustion The catalytic performance of the catalysts was evaluated using the T90 parameter (the temperature at which 90 % of benzene conversion is achieved). Before the evaluation, the optimal synthesis conditions of samples including Mn-Co3O4 and PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 were investigated. The reactivity of Co3O4 derives from sufficient Co3+ sites on the surface that can activate the C–H bond among the hydrocarbons [50]. Doping the Mn ions into the Co3O4 bulk could weaken the Co-O bond by spontaneously strengthening the Mn-O bond, resulting in a more active lattice oxygen species to interact with adsorbed benzene molecules. The doping amount of Mn was investigated and shown in Fig. S12a. An obvious promoting effect could be observed in the range of Mn/Co from 0 to 0.1 with the optimal activity achieved at a theoretical value of 0.05. A further increase in the doping amount inhibited the catalytic activity, probably due to the phase separation of MnCO3 from Co3O4. In the PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 synthesis process, the particle size of Pt under the process of NaBH4-induced reduction could be affected by the pH value of the reduction environment [51]. We investigated the suitable condition for this reduction process and the optimal activity was achieved in a molar ratio of NaBH4/NaOH = 0.5:1 (Fig. S12b). The benzene combustion catalytic performance is shown in Fig. 6 a. Within the temperature range of 100–300 °C, Mn-Co3O4 showed a mild reactivity. However, depositing different Pt entities greatly affected the catalytic performance. The introduction of Pt NPs significantly promoted catalytic performance with T90 achieved at 148 °C. While depositing Pt1 species displayed an inhibition effect with T90 achieved at 250 °C. To further investigate the observed decrease in catalytic activity caused by Pt single atoms, we performed additional experiments by gradually reducing the nominal Pt loading from 0.4 to 0.1 wt% during preparation. As shown in Fig. S13, our results confirm that the negative effect on activity is still present and that the catalytic performance is independent of the loading of Pt single atoms. The plausible reasons are as follows: The strong Pt-O bonding reduces surface lattice oxygen mobility, hindering oxygen activation during benzene combustion, with Pt single atoms as the main active centers whose activity is controlled by Pt-O interactions. At a low nominal loading during preparation (0.1 wt%), Pt may block some Mn-Co3O4 active sites. At a higher nominal loading (0.4 wt%), the catalytic activity would theoretically decrease further. However, the increased Pt density and greater number of Pt single atoms introduce additional active sites that are more active than the Pt-O sites at low loading. This potential enhancement is neutralized by the suppressive effect of strong Pt-O-Co bonds and the Pt-blocking effect on Mn-Co3O4 active sites, resulting in a consistent decrease in overall catalytic activity (Fig. S13). Furthermore, the benzene combustion rate per gram of Pt was calculated and is shown in Fig. 6b as an Arrhenius plot. The kinetic experiment is conducted within the kinetic region to make sure benzene conversion is below 15 % and eliminate mass and heat transfer limitations. The apparent activation energies of Mn-Co3O4, PtNP/Mn-Co3O4, and Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 were determined to be 98, 89, and 111 kJ mol−1. The lower activation energy of PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 suggests that the benzene combustion reaction is more favorable in this sample compared to the Pt1-deposited one. And this disparity may imply the different reaction behavior, which can be explained as follows: Metallic Pt nanoparticles with greater surface electron density exhibit higher adsorption and activation ability to reactants through a larger extent of electron back-donation effect, in comparison to its Pt1 counterpart. Besides, a promotive interaction could facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies at the interface with the evidence of the amount of Pt2+ species in Pt 4f spectra, and the redshift of A1g feature in Raman spectra. The formed oxygen vacancies could perform as a secondary oxygen source assisting the catalytically active center of metallic Pt site and promoting the oxidation process. Furthermore, we chose a Fe2O3 support which inert to this reaction and deposited Pt NPs with similar particle size (Fig. S14) to that of PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 to highlight the EMSI effect in this reaction. As can be seen in Fig. S15, the combined individual activities of Mn-Co3O4 and PtNP/Fe2O3 at low-temperature ranges is much lower than that of PtNP/Mn-Co3O4, in other words, the interaction between Pt and support is of great importance in determining catalytic performance. This indicates that the interaction between Pt NPs and Mn-Co3O4, particularly the electronic metal-support interaction, plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic performance. In contrast, Pt1 species atomically dispersed on the surface of Mn-Co3O4 with the formation of over-strong Pt-O bonding, decreasing the mobility of surface lattice oxygen (Figs. 3 and 4). The findings in this study align with the report in the literature, which proposes the formation energy of oxygen vacancy at metal-support interfacial sites is lower on PtNP-deposited catalyst in comparison to that on Pt1-deposited one revealed by theoretical simulations [52]. Catalyst durability is of great importance in practical applications. Fig. S16 depicts the stability test of the optimal PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 catalyst under the atmosphere of both dry air and excess 5 vol% water vapor conditions. This reaction condition was based on industrial benzene exhaust conditions of 500–2000 ppm benzene and 10–20 vol% O2. Water vapor of 5 vol% amount could be less of an effect on the catalytic performance, and the 30-hour maintenance over 95% benzene conversion under reaction conditions of both dry air and water vapor at 180 °C is a demonstration of the high catalytic performance and the excellent water resistance property of the as-synthesized PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 catalyst. To investigate the potential structural changes during the catalytic reaction, we conducted XRD and XPS analyses on post-reaction samples of PtNP/Mn-Co3O4, Pt1/Mn-Co3O4, and Mn-Co3O4. As illustrated in Fig. S17a, the XRD pattern shows no Pt-related diffraction peaks, indicating that the deposited Pt species remain in a highly dispersed state. Furthermore, the XPS results presented in Fig. S17b reveal that the chemical state of the Pt active sites after the reaction is consistent with that of the fresh samples, indicating no significant alteration in their chemical state. Additionally, the correlation between XPS O 1s spectra collected from post-reaction samples and their catalytic activity was unveiled. As can be seen in Fig. S18, the relative abundance of surface adsorbed oxygen (Oads) follows the order of PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 (41%) > Mn-Co3O4 (36%) > Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 (35%), which is in line with the tested activity trend (Fig. 6a). 3.7 Plausible reaction pathway To illustrate the critical reaction intermediates and investigate the reaction behaviors over Pt-deposited samples, the in situ FTIR spectra of benzene combustion are conducted in two different feed gas environments. Firstly, we evaluate the reactivity of surface lattice oxygen species by applying the feed gas environment of 500 ppm benzene balanced with N2. Prior to experiments, the pretreatment process of high-temperature N2 purging removed the surface adsorbed oxygen species. The in situ FTIR spectra of as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. S19. The gradual accumulation of various partial oxidation intermediates proves the participation of lattice oxygen species. Based on the existing literature, we identified critical reaction intermediates, such as adsorbed phenolate species (1468 and 1232 cm−1), p-benzoquinone (1624 cm−1), o-benzoquinone (1719 and 1416 cm−1), maleate species (1760, 1524, 1303 and 1175 cm−1), acetate species (1558 and 1353 cm−1), formate species (1606 and 1383 cm−1), and H2O (1668 cm−1), with their assignments shown in Table S1. The reactivity of lattice oxygen species over these samples is assessed by collecting the intensity of critical intermediates’ characteristic IR features (phenolate of 1232 cm−1, p-benzoquinone of 1624 cm−1, o-benzoquinone of 1719 cm−1, maleate of 1303 cm−1, acetate of 1353 cm−1, and formate of 1383 cm−1) and statistically analyzing the generation rate of intermediates as the function of time using the intensity of the 30 min’s spectra as the calibration reference set at 1, with the results shown in Fig. S20. The ever-growing surface species’ IR bands of Mn-Co3O4 indicate the continuous production of downstream products over sufficient surface Co-O sites owing to the participation of lattice oxygen species. The following comparison of Pt-deposited samples’ reaction behavior could be more meaningful with respect to the EMSI effect. In PtNP/Mn-Co3O4, the bands' intensity increased rapidly in the first 5 min and then increased slowly in the following 25 min. While in the Pt1/Mn-Co3O4, the bands’ intensity gradually increased in 20 min followed by a stagnant in the last 10 min. We further used a normalization method to enable a direct quantitative comparison between Pt-deposited samples (Fig. S21), specifically, we normalized both the FTIR spectra and the sample backgrounds using the intensity of the Co-O stretching bands below 1000 cm−1. The results indicate that the Pt1-deposited sample accumulated more intermediates than its PtNP counterpart in the whole reaction process. In the absence of gaseous O2, the less reactive lattice oxygen species in Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 induce the coating of active centers by surface species and thus cause this greater accumulation and this “stagnant” phenomenon. Benefiting from the promotive EMSI effect, this negative effect is alleviated in the case of PtNP/Mn-Co3O4, yet the exhausted lattice oxygen species cannot be replenished by gaseous O2 still hindering the oxidation reaction. To simulate the benzene combustion conditions, we conducted an in situ FTIR experiment using the feed gas of 500 ppm benzene, 10 vol% O2, and balanced with N2. Fig. 7 (a and b) display the in situ FTIR spectra of benzene combustion within a temperature range of 100 to 250 °C. For PtNP- and Pt1-deposited samples, the in situ FTIR spectra exhibited characteristic features of critical intermediates similar to that in Fig. S18. As can be seen in Fig. 7, the intensity of all bands increased as the temperature rose from 100 to 250 °C, suggesting the continuous reaction between adsorbed benzene with reactive oxygen species on the catalysts’ surfaces. The same normalization method was also conducted, shown in Fig. S22, and found that the relative abundance of surface species on PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 is higher than that on Pt1 counterpart. This indicates PtNP/Mn-Co3O4′s greater efficiency in terms of more oxygen species reacting with a higher amount of adsorbed benzene, consistent with the results in catalytic performance (Fig. 6). Furthermore, to insight into the benzene combustion behavior and the rate-limiting steps on Pt-deposited catalysts, we collected the intensity of characteristic IR peaks corresponding to critical reaction intermediates (phenolate of 1232 cm−1, p-benzoquinone of 1624 cm−1, o-benzoquinone of 1719 cm−1, maleate of 1303 cm−1, acetate of 1353 cm−1, and formate of 1383 cm−1), and statistically analyzed the accumulation rate of intermediates as the function of temperature using the intensity of the 250 °C spectra as the calibration reference set at 1. The results are shown in Fig. S23 and present a continuous generation of all these surface species. For PtNP/Mn-Co3O4, the accumulation rate of acetate is slightly faster than other intermediates, consistent with its oxidation representing the probable rate-determining step [13]. Conversely, Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 demonstrates markedly accelerated phenolate formation kinetics, suggesting that its subsequent oxidation serves as the principal rate-limiting process. This outcome indicates that different reaction mechanisms occurred on each kind of Pt active center, however, the higher relative abundance of surface species (Fig. S22) and the lower apparent activation energy (Fig. 6b) demonstrate benzene combustion is more favorable on PtNP sites. Same methodology was conducted on Mn-Co3O4 (Fig. S24), and turned out the consumption of acetate could be the potential rate-determining step. The shift of the rate-determining step among these samples implied different reaction mechanisms occur in each sample’s different active center. According to the FTIR results, a catalytic cycle of benzene combustion over PtNP sites is summarized in Fig. 7c, within the paradigm proposed by previous studies [29,53]. The combustion of benzene initiates when benzene molecules adsorbed on the Pt surface react with reactive oxygen species at or adjacent to Pt sites, resulting in the formation of benzene oxide. Subsequently, benzene oxide undergoes a spontaneous rearrangement to form phenolate. From phenolate, several reaction pathways emerge, leading to the creation of different compounds. One pathway results in o-benzoquinone through the oxidation of surface catecholate, while another pathway produces p-benzoquinone via the decomposition of surface hydroquinone. Following the formation of these benzoquinones, ring cleavage occurs, producing maleate through two parallel pathways, which involve the intermediates 2,5-dioxo-3-hexanedioate and muconate. The oxidation of maleate subsequently leads to the formation of short-chain fatty acid salts, such as acetate, which is formed by the dissociation of malonate, and formate, produced through the decomposition of oxalate. Ultimately, these species undergo decarboxylation facilitated by reactive oxygen species, resulting in the release of CO2 and H2O as the final combustion products. To encapsulate, this work highlights the significance of EMSI in catalyst design for environmental catalysis through insight into the EMSI characteristics and investigating how the EMSI impacts benzene combustion behavior over Pt nanoparticles and site-isolated Pt atoms. Technologies combined with electron microscopy and in situ FTIR identify the establishment of expected Pt active centers on Mn-Co3O4 (Fig. 1). Unlike the case in Pt1/Mn-Co3O4, we confirm a rapid electron transfer from Pt NPs to support, which leads to the reduction of support (Fig. 2). The disparity in EMSI greatly affect the benzene combustion efficacy with the T90 temperature of PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 100 °C lower than the Pt1 counterpart (Fig. 6). This as-prepared PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 also outperforms the state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts reported in recent literature (Table S2). Various analytical techniques confirm that moderate electronic interaction over PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 leading to the feasible activation of surface lattice oxygen at the perimeter sites along with the higher surface electron density of Pt NPs trigger the excellent oxygen activation and benzene adsorption ability (Figs. 3 and 4). Mechanistic insights reveal the EMSI-induced benefits of being less prone to the poisoning of surface species accumulation over PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 (Figs. 5 and S20). In situ FTIR spectroscopy identifies the critical reaction intermediates and proposes the plausible benzene decomposition route over Pt active center (Fig. 7). 4 Conclusion Benzene catalytic combustion is an important environment-relevant reaction, and its efficacy can be greatly influenced by the EMSI effect between Pt active centers and reducible support material. To illustrate how EMSI works on representative Pt active centers, this study successfully established metallic Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms, on Mn-Co3O4 support through controlled synthetic routes. The results highlight the profound impact of EMSI on catalyst efficiency. PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 demonstrated superior catalytic performance, as evidenced by a significant reduction in the T90 temperature to 148 °C. This enhancement is attributed to the promotive EMSI effect, which promotes beneficial charge transfer dynamics and enhances the availability of reactive oxygen species. Conversely, inhibitive EMSI in Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 resulted in limited oxidative reactivity by constructing stable Pt-O bonding. Furthermore, metallic Pt sites with higher surface electron density exhibit excellent benzene adsorption ability and are also responsible for enhanced catalytic performance. Kinetic studies reveal that PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 follows a single-site Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, while Pt1/Mn-Co3O4 follows a dual-site one. The O2 dissociation mechanism indicates higher O2 utilization on PtNP/Mn-Co3O4. Moreover, the less negative reaction order and reduced surface species accumulation without O2 assistance suggest that the EMSI effect in PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 mitigates poisoning from competitive adsorption by facilitating the activation of adjacent lattice oxygen. The in situ technology of FTIR unveiled the plausible benzene decomposition route with distinct rate-determining steps. The findings are devoted to the rational design of Pt-based catalysts, and we hope this work could inspire further research in catalyst design for VOC combustion as well as environmental applications.

        "dc:description": "Insight into metal-support interactions at the nanoscale is of prominent significance in the development of efficient catalysts for volatile organic compound (VOC) abatement. This study investigates catalysts with distinct Pt active centers including Pt nanoparticles (PtNP) and single-atom Pt (Pt1) supported on Mn-Co3O4 and reveals their electronic metal-support interaction characteristics. Benzene combustion tests show a contrasting trend exhibited by these two representative samples. Characterization techniques confirm that the superior performance of PtNP/Mn-Co3O4 stems from promotive electronic interaction. The effective charge transfer enhances reducibility and oxygen activation, coupled with the excellent benzene adsorption capacity of PtNP. However, the inhibitive role of Pt1 in Mn-Co3O4 hinders the lattice oxygen mobility and leads to undesirable performance. Mechanistic insights elucidate the EMSI-induced benefits of being less prone to surface species poisoning, along with detailed reaction mechanisms and benzene decomposition route. This EMSI-dependent understanding of benzene combustion behavior offers valuable insights into the rational design of Pt-based catalysts for benzene abatement.",
