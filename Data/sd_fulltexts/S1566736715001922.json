We have successfully synthesized a 3D-NbOx supported Pt composite as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst. 3D-NbOx support is prepared by using KIT-6 hard template, and 3D-NbOx supported Pt composite is prepared by reducing H2PtCl6 and depositing Pt nanoparticles onto 3D-NbOx framework. Physical tests show that 3D-NbOx has an ordered framework, and that in Pt/3D-NbOx composite, ultra fine Pt nanoparticles are distributed along with 3D-NbOx framework. Electrochemical tests indicate that Pt/3D-NbOx-C composite exhibits comparable ORR activity and significantly higher durability compared with Pt/C catalyst. These findings demonstrate that 3D-NbOx is a suitable Pt support, facilitating catalytic performance enhancement. Graphical abstract The 3D-NbOx support possesses uniform frameworks and open pores; Pt/3D-NbOx has a high level of Pt dispersion, and exhibits superior ORR activity and durability to Pt/C catalyst. Keywords 3D-niobium oxide Platinum catalyst Durability Oxygen reduction reaction 1 Introduction Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are attractive power sources compared with the currently used secondary batteries due to their high energy density, zero emissions, especially no charging process [1,2]. Nonetheless, there still remain a few challenges needed to be overcome. The key issues that prohibit PEMFC development include: 1) support material corrosion; 2) support framework collapse; and 3) catalyst agglomeration. All of them are associated with the catalyst support [3,4]. The catalyst supports have long been the research interest because they help disperse noble metal catalysts, enhance catalysts utilization, and stabilize catalyst nanoparticles. The support materials can also interplay with catalytic metals and influence catalyst particle size, particle shape, thereby the catalytic activity [5,6]. Therefore, choosing an appropriate catalyst support is a vital strategy to improve PEMFC performance. Generally, the requirements for catalyst support materials can be summarized as: 1) high specific surface area, 2) high electrochemical stability under fuel cell operating conditions, 3) high conductivity, and 4) easy-to-recover Pt in the used catalyst. In the past decades, carbon-based materials were the first choice for catalyst support because of their high surface area, high conductivity, and excellent ability to load catalysts. Vulcan XC-72 was widely used by researchers in this community [7,8]. Meanwhile, other carbon materials with novel nanostructures, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [9,10], carbon nanofibers (CNFs) [11,12], mesoporous carbon (MSC) [13,14], and graphene [15,16], were also developed. Unfortunately, despite tremendous efforts on carbon materials, they cannot meet the requirements for PEMFC use, because carbon-based support materials are susceptible to corrosion under PEMFC operating conditions, especially at cathodic side (ORR) [17,18]. The harsh conditions including high temperature (80–100°C), high potential (0.6–1.2V), and strong acidity accelerate the corrosion processes [19]. Thus it is necessary to search for more anti-corrosive support materials for the PEMFC catalysts. Currently, the corrosion-resistant transition metal oxides, such as TiO2 (or Ebonex) [20–22], SnO2 (or ITO) [23,24], IrO2 [25,26] and WO3 [27,28] have been intensively studied to improve the stabilities of the supports. Although certain advances have been made in this direction, there are still some problems for the developed oxide materials. In general, most of them possess low surface area, low conductivity, and some of them are unstable under applied voltage in the acidic environment. Therefore, to explore a wider range of potential support materials with desired structures and properties, suitable for catalyst supports, is the fundamental research work in fuel cell development. In the present work, we have fabricated a three-dimensional structure of NbOx (denoted as 3D-NbOx) as Pt catalyst support. This type of support material has much advantages over materials of zero-dimensional (nanoparticles), one-dimensional (nanowires, nanotubes), and two-dimensional (nanofilms, graphene) structures. Firstly, 3D-NbOx possesses an extremely stable framework with a three-dimensional structure, which can prevent the catalyst from collapsing during operations. Secondly, Pt catalyst can be easily supported on the 3D-framework, leading to uniform Pt dispersion along with the 3D-NbOx framework. Thirdly, the 3D-NbOx supported Pt catalyst (denoted as Pt/3D-NbOx) can effectively avoid the agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles, since they keep a space with each other by anchoring Pt nanoparticles at different sites on 3D-NbOx framework. In addition, Pt/3D-NbOx catalyst with three-dimensional structure allows sufficient mass transfer, and facilitates high efficiency of oxygen reduction. Based on these advantages and the intrinsic chemical and electrochemical stability of NbOx, we carried out an investigation on Pt/3D-NbOx composite catalyst. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on Pt/3D-NbOx catalyst applied for oxygen reduction reaction. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals Hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6·6H2O) and NbCl5 were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Corp., China. Vulcan XC-72 carbon black was purchased from E-TEK and 5wt.% Nafion solution was obtained from Dupont, USA. Except where specified, all chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received. 2.2 Materials preparation 2.2.1 Synthesis of 3D-NbOx KIT-6 hard template was prepared with the reported method [29]. Briefly, 4.9g of P123 was dissolved in 175mL of distilled water and 7.6mL of conc. HCl (35%), and then 6.0mL of butanol was added and kept stirring for 1h at 35°C. After that, 10.5g of TEOS (99%) was added and left stirring for 24h. Subsequently, the mixture was transferred to an autoclave for hydrothermal reaction at 100°C for 24h. The resulting product was filtered and dried at 100°C without washing. The template was removed by extraction in an ethanol–HCl mixture, followed by calcination at 550°C for 8h. Synthesis of 3D-NbOx was conducted as the following procedure. 0.45g of KIT-6 template was added to 1.2g of NbCl5 dissolved in ethanol and the mixture was stirred for 3h. Then the mixture was placed in a drying oven and subjected to a long-time vaporization of the solvent at 40°C. During the course of vaporization, the processes of repetitive impregnations of NbCl5 into KIT-6 template channels occur. To ensure sufficient and steady impregnations, it was maintained in the drying oven for three or four days with a little opening to overflow the vapors. After completely dried, the prepared composite (NbCl5/KIT-6) was calcined at 550°C for 6h in a chamber furnace under O2 flow to obtain NbOX/KIT-6 composite. Finally it was treated with 10wt.% HF solution to remove silica KIT-6 template. 2.2.2 Preparation of Pt/NbOx and Pt/NbOx-C catalysts Pt/3D-NbOx (20wt% Pt) catalyst was prepared through a microwave-assisted polyol process (MAPP) with H2PtCl6 as a precursor [30]. Briefly, 80mg of 3D-NbOx powder was dispersed into a mixture solution of 50mL ethylene glycol and 10mL isopropyl alcohol under ultrasonic treatment for 1h. Then 2.7mL of 0.038molL−1 H2PtCl6/ethylene glycol solution was added and continuously stirred for 3h. The mixture was adjusted to a pH value of 12.00 by adding 1molL−1 NaOH/ethylene glycol solution, fed subsequently with argon gas for 15min to remove the dissolved oxygen, and heated in a microwave oven for 50s (about 135°C) to reduce H2PtCl6 to Pt metal. After it was cooled to room temperature, 0.1molL−1 HNO3 solution was added to adjust pH value to 3–4, followed by continuously stirring for 12h. Finally, the mixture was centrifuged and washed repeatedly with ultrapure water (Millipore, 18.2MΩcm) until no Cl− ions were detected. The product (Pt/3D-NbOx) was dried in a vacuum oven for 6h at 80°C. To ensure the sufficient electronic conductivity, Vulcan XC 72 was mixed with Pt/3D-NbOx catalyst to obtain Pt/3D-NbOx-C composite [31]. As comparison, the Pt/C (20wt% Pt) catalyst was prepared by the same method as Pt/3D-NbOx catalyst, i.e., prepared by MAPP, which has been proved to be a reliable method for ultrafine Pt nanoparticle preparation [32]. 2.3 Characterization of physical properties XRD analyses of the samples were carried out on the D/max-RB diffractometer (Rigaku Corp., Japan) with Cu Ka as the X-ray source operating at 45kV and 100mA. The scanning rate was 4°min−1 with an angular resolution of 0.05° (2θ). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the synthesized 3D-NbOx was measured on ST-2000 Adsorb-1 (Beijing analysis Instruments LTD., China). For a rapid energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of chemical composition, the Hitachi-S-4700 analyzer was coupled to a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4700). The sample surface was impinged from the normal angle for 100s by the X-ray incident electron beam with energies ranging from 3 to 30keV. The EDX spectra were recorded on the randomly selected regions of the sample. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the samples were taken by a TECNAI G2 F30 (USA) field emission transmission electron microscope with a spatial resolution of 0.17nm. Before taking the electron micrographs, the samples were finely ground and ultrasonically dispersed in isopropyl alcohol, and a drop of the resultant dispersion was deposited and dried on a standard copper grid coated with carbon film. The applied voltage was 300kV. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements The catalyst ink was prepared by ultrasonically dispersing the catalyst in ethanol with a concentration of 2mgmL−1. 5μL of the ink was loaded on the glassy carbon disk electrode (4mm in diameter). After dried in argon atmosphere, it was covered with 5mL of 0.5wt% Nafion in ethanol. The glassy carbon was polished with 0.05mm alumina suspensions to a mirror finish before each experiment. Electrochemical measurements were carried out on an electrochemical working station (CHI 650D, China) in a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell filled with 0.5molmL−1 H2SO4 aqueous solution at 25°C. The glassy carbon disk electrode made by above-mentioned procedure was used as the working electrode. A piece of Pt foil (1cm2) and Hg/Hg2SO4 were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode (0.68V vs. RHE), respectively. For cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests, 0.5molL−1 H2SO4 solution in electrochemical cell was firstly purged with ultrapure argon gas for 30min, and then a continuous CV cycling at 0.05Vs−1 was performed until a steady response was obtained. The CV curves were recorded in the potential range from 0.05 to 1.2V at 0.02Vs−1. For linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests, 0.5molL−1 H2SO4 solution was bubbled with ultrapure oxygen gas for 20min to obtain an oxygen saturated solution. The LSV curves were recorded in the potential range from 1.2 to 0.4V at 0.005Vs−1. As our previous works [25,26] proved, the accelerated potential cycling test (APCT) is a fast way to evaluate the stability of a catalyst. In this work, the stabilities of the catalysts were also evaluated by the APCT method. The potential cycling tests were conducted in an argon-purged 0.5molL−1 H2SO4 solution for 2000cycles within the potential range from 0.05 to 1.2V at 0.05Vs−1. All solutions applied were prepared with ultrapure water (Millipore, 18.2MΩcm). All the potentials reported herein were versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Material characterization Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of the Pt/3D-NbOx catalyst. It is clearly observed that two rather different phases appear in this figure. For the first phase, the sharp diffraction peaks at 22.5°, 28.6°, 36.7°, 46.0°, 50.6°, and 55.1° (2 theta), corresponding to the crystal planes, (001), (100), (101), (002), (110), and (102), could be indexed to Nb2O5 (JCPDS: 271003), which is the major component in the 3D-NbOx sample. The high crystallinity of 3D-NbOx is recognized by the sharp diffraction peaks, which is formed at higher calcination temperature (500°C) and benefits conductivity enhancement. For another phase, the broadened diffraction peaks with low intensity can be attributed to the nanoparticles of metal Pt according to JCPDS: 65-2868, which shows a typical diffraction characteristic of ultrafine nanocrystalline. Fig. 2 presents the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of 3D-NbOx and Pt/3D-NbOx on different scales. From Fig. 2a and b, it is readily seen that the 3D-NbOx has a structure with uniform and highly ordered framework and mesopores. This highly ordered structure is generated through an exact negative replica of highly ordered KIT-6 template. The size of a single cell in TEM image is approximately 10nm in diameter. The BET surface area of the synthesized 3D-NbOx is 133.2m2 g−1 with a mean pore size of 7.4nm. The high crystallinity of 3D-NbOx is further confirmed by the electron diffraction pattern (the inset in Fig. 2b, bottom-right), in which the ordered bright dots are clearly observed. Fig. 2c shows the high-resolution TEM image of Pt/3D-NbOx catalyst, and the ordered structure can also be found in this composite. The Pt particles with rather small diameters of 2–3nm are deposited along with the framework, which helps obtain high dispersion, high surface area, and thereafter high catalytic activity of Pt catalyst. Energy dispersive analyses of X-ray (EDAX) were conducted to obtain the information on elementary composition of 3D-NbOx material. Fig. 3a and b are the EDAX spectra recorded from two randomly selected areas of the 3D-NbOx sample. We can easily observe the oxygen and niobium peaks produced by electrons from different electron shells (K for O, and K, L for Nb), confirming the presence of oxygen and niobium elements in the sample. The carbon and copper peaks are simultaneously observed, which are produced by the substrate and cannot influence the test results. Table 1 presents the relative element contents obtained from the two EDAX spectra. The average contents of oxygen and niobium are 57.4 atom% and 42.6 atom%, respectively, suggesting that the composition of niobium oxide (NbO1.3) is of nonstoichiometry. 3.2 Electrochemical analyses To confirm the catalytic activities towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the CV and LSV tests were carried out for Pt/3D-NbOx, Pt/3D-NbOx-C (with different C content), and Pt/C catalysts on RDE, and the results are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2 . In Fig. 4a, all of the polarization curves exhibit hydrogen adsorption/desorption peaks as well as oxide formation/reduction peaks of polycrystalline platinum. However, the coulombic charge of Pt/3D-NbOx-C or Pt/C catalyst in hydrogen region is much larger than that of Pt/3D-NbOx catalyst. The lower coulombic charge of Pt/3D-NbOx catalyst can be interpreted in terms of semiconductive property of NbOx which leads to insufficient Pt utilization. The remarkable coulombic charge of Pt/3D-NbOx-C catalyst can be attributed to the Vulcan XC-72 introduction, leading to the formation of conductive network between Pt particles. Based on the coulombic charges, the electrochemical surface area (ESA) can be calculated. The ESA of Pt/3D-NbOx catalyst is only 5.8m2·g−1, whereas the ESAs of Pt/3D-NbOx-C (10%), Pt/3D-NbOx-C (10%) and Pt/3D-NbOx-C (10%) catalysts are 40.5, 63.4, and 52.6m2 g−1, respectively, the highest ESA value is much close to that of Pt/C catalyst (67.2m2·g−1). Fig. 4b presents the ORR activities of Pt/3D-NbOx, Pt/3D-NbOx-C, and Pt/C catalysts, and the kinetic current density (J k) calculated with Koutecky–Levich equation [3] are listed in Table 2. Apparently, Pt/3D-NbOx catalyst has lower onset potential and lower reduction current density than Pt/3D-NbOx-C or Pt/C catalyst, which is also caused by the lower conductivity of NbOx. When comparing the Pt/3D-NbOx-C composites with Pt/C catalysts, two different polarization processes have been observed. Pt/3D-NbOx-C has a higher J k values at 0.85V, while Pt/C has a higher J k value at 0.80V, indicating a fast and slow polarization processes for them, respectively. The different polarization processes are related to the properties of the supports, i.e., pure C supported Pt catalyst, with excellent electrical conductivity, shows a fast ORR polarization, while NbOx-C supported Pt catalyst, with the conductivity-modified support, exhibits a slower ORR polarization. Fig. 5 shows the accelerated potential cycling tests (APCT) on Pt/3D-NbOx-C and Pt/C catalysts. The polarization curves were recorded at the beginning and at the 400th, 800th, 1200th, 1600th, and 2000th cycles, respectively. From both Fig. 5a and b, it is observed that the coulombic charge in hydrogen region decreases gradually during the APCT. The ESA values calculated from the hydrogen desorption integrals with cycle number are shown in Fig. 5c. The degradation percentage of ESA value for Pt/3D-NbOx-C is 26.6%, whereas 42.5% for Pt/C catalyst. The lower degradation rate or higher stability of Pt/3D-NbOx-C is related to the stable support of 3D-NbOx as well as the firm interaction between Pt particles and 3D-NbOx, which cause Pt to remain a high dispersion state and anchor at certain sites on 3D-NbOx framework. 4 Conclusions We have successfully synthesized 3D-NbOx as Pt support. The 3D-NbOx has an ordered framework and open pores with an average diameter of 10nm. Pt nanoparticles have been loaded along with the framework of 3D-NbOx to form Pt/3D-NbOx composite. Electrochemical tests show that Pt/3D-NbOx-C catalyst exhibits comparable ORR catalytic activity and significantly high durability compared with Pt/C catalyst. The 3D-NbOx can act as an excellent catalyst support, and Pt/3D-NbOx-C will be a promising cathodic catalyst for PEMFC applications.
