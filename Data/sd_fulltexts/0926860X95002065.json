The desorption of the K promoter from the catalyst at 870-1080 K could be characterized, by measuring angular distributions and simultaneous Arrhenius plots, as a function of the angle around the sample. The two activation energies observed for K desorption from the fresh catalyst were 260 kJ/mol (2.7 eV) and 330 kJ/mol (3.4 eV); the used catalyst had only one, much smaller activation barrier at 164 kJ/mol ( 1.70 eV). The chemical state of potassium in the catalyst changes from a stronger bound ionic, probably in the form of Fe--O-K, to a weaker, more covalent one during the industrial process. A large difference in work functions between the fresh (3.9 eV) and used (1.7 eV) catalyst was observed. This seems to be due to formation of K oxides on the surface of the used catalyst, caused by enrichment of potassium at the surface during the industrial use.

Engvall et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 239-246 classical example is the synthesis of ammonia where the potassium promoter in the fused-iron catalyst is essential for a good catalyst performance [2]. Potassium atoms are considered to be localized at the active centres present on the surface [3]. The chemical state of this alkali promoter has been the subject of a large number of investigations during the last 60 years. Still, the exact role of alkali promotion in ammonia synthesis catalyst is controversial even today, partly because the measurements and characterization experiments of the promoting effect during real process conditions have often been lacking. A recent review [4] and two monographs [5,6] on this catalyst system emphasize the importance and complex- ity of the problems involved here. The migration of K to the surface of the reduced catalyst has been demonstrated by chemisorption of CO, CO2, H2, and N2, by energy dispersive X-ray analysis, field ion mass spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning Auger electron microscopy, and by high-voltage electron microscopy. A review of these results and all concerned references have been given in 1991 in the chapter by Schlrgl in Ref. [5] and in 1995 in the chapter by Stolze in Ref. [6]. We have employed ultra-high vacuum (UHV) molecular beam techniques to study the characteristics of the emission of potassium species from industrial cat- alyst samples at or above typical process temperatures. Results for iron-oxide catalyst for the styrene process [7-12] and vanadia catalyst for the sulfuric acid process [ 13 ] have been published earlier. Preliminary results for such studies for the ammonia synthesis catalyst have also been reported elsewhere [ 14,15]. The possibility to take industrial catalysts directly into the UHV chamber and to apply molecular-beam research techniques to them has been demonstrated there. A study by surface ionization of the potassium promoter on the surface of industrial catalyst samples for ammonia synthesis is reported in this paper. Angular distributions of the thermal desorption and/or emission of different potassium species from the same catalyst samples have been reported earlier by Engvall et al. [ 14] ; a temper- ature-programmed reduction (TPR) study on the same samples has been published by Menon and Skaugset [16]. 2. Experimental The surface ionization (SI) method, used in the present study, is very sensitive and useful for the detection of neutral alkali species, giving almost unit detection probability [ 17 ]. A typical SI detector working on this principle is shown sche- matically in Fig. 1. Here an atomic flux of alkali strikes a hot surface. The degree of ionization ct (ratio of numbers of ions desorbing from the filament and of corresponding neutrals) is given by the well-known Saha-Langmuir equation [ 18 ], which for alkali is expressed as: a= i + / io= 1/2 exp[ ( Clg- l) /kT] K.

The value of a is larger than 1 only if ~>L and thus in most cases only alkali atoms are surface ionized to any large extent due to their low ionization potentials. The experiments were carded out in an UHV apparatus with a pressure of 10 -9 mbar during the experiments. Samples of commercial fused-iron catalysts (AS4 type) for ammonia synthesis were obtained from Norsk Hydro. One type was a fresh prereduced catalyst. The other type had been used under actual process conditions in the plant reactor for about five years. The samples were in the passi- vated (superficially re-oxidized) form, since they would otherwise be pyrophoric. Full details of the passivation treatment for the fresh and used catalysts and their TPR profiles have been given previously in this journal by Menon and Skaugset [ 16]. The BET surface areas for the fresh and used catalysts were 12 and 8 m2/g; the pore volume was 0.1 cm3/g for both. Each sample was cut to obtain a fiat surface and mounted in a folded tantalum foil to expose this surface. The sample was heated by passing an AC current of approximately 30 A through the Ta foil. During the experiments the sample was held at ground potential. The thermal desorption of potassium from the sample surface was monitored with the SI detector shown in Fig. 1. The detector can be rotated 360around the catalyst sample to measure the angular distribution of the emitted potassium. The detector contains a very pure rhenium ribbon (zone melted), which ionizes the impinging flux of potassium coming from the sample. The ribbon temperature TF was approximately 1450 K and a positive potential UF of 150 V was applied to it. Since Re is a metal with a high work function of 5.0 eV and the ionization potential for potassium is 4.3 eV, the total potassium flux was ionized. Ions formed on the ribbon were accelerated by the applied electric field towards the concentric collector at ground potential. The positive current to the collector was directly measured with an electrometer. 3. Results and discussion Some typical results for potassium emission from fresh and used ammonia catalysts, measured with the SI detector, are shown in Figs. 2, 3 and 4. The angular 242 K.

The scale along the horizontal axis is + 1.5- 10-8 A. distributions of the total flux of K from the fresh and used catalysts at 1080 K are shown in Fig. 2. The type of distribution, which is characteristic of equilibrium conditions at the surface, is a cosine function, i.e. a circle in a polar plot. The distributions in Fig. 2 are slightly different from the cosine, both showing a larger flux in the direction of the surface normal. This indicates directly that some non- equilibrium process exists. In Ref. [ 17], the extra flux around the surface normal is shown to be due to clusters, which are formed just outside the surface, in a boundary (Knudsen) layer which is not collision-free. Similar phenomena are also reported in Refs. [ 14,15,18]. The two distributions in Fig. 2 are measured at the same temperature. It is seen that the used catalyst emits K at a higher rate, due to the lower activation energy for desorption, as discussed below. The Arrhenius plots for the desorbing flux of potassium measured with the SI detector at various angles were determined for the two samples in the temperature range 870-1080 K. The results are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. The measurements accomplished at the normal direction (0, which corresponds to the maximum signal, indicate a different activation barrier for each of the catalyst types. They are E, =259+ 10 kJ/mol (2.7 eV) for the fresh and E3 = 164+4 kJ/mol (1.70 eV) for the used catalyst. (All error values correspond to 95% confidence limits.)

S is given in amperes. The activation energy is 164 + 4 kJ/mol. the case of the fresh catalyst. Thus, at an angle close to the catalyst surface (85 from the normal) two activation energy barriers at E1 = 259 + 10 and E2 = 326 + 16 kJ/mol (3.4 eV) can be distinguished for the fresh catalyst, as shown in Fig. 3. The large activation energy of 326 kJ/mol in the case of the fresh catalyst should be due to release of K from an iron oxide species, e.g. with potassium bound to oxygen as K-O-Fe [ 8 ]. A similar activation energy, 300 + 20 kJ/mol (3.1 eV), is observed in the iron oxide catalyst for styrene production [ 8,9]. However, in the ammonia synthesis catalyst potassium may also exist in non-reducible ternary oxides formed with other promoters [ 19 ]. A chemisorbed form of anhydrous KOH, as suggested recently by Schtitze et al. [20] cannot be entirely excluded, since the dissociation energy of KOH to K and OH is 362 kJ/mol in the gas phase, and this value may be somewhat lower on the surface. However, the most likely form giving the largest activation energy for the fresh catalyst is K-O-Fe. The lowest of the two activation barriers of 259 kJ/mol is somewhat larger than what is normally found for K desorption on various iron crystal faces [ 21 ], of 218- 239 kJ/mol. The dissociation energy of K20 to K and KO is 294 kJ/mol, calculated for gas phase species, and thus a loss from this molecule cannot be excluded. It is anyway possible that the surface studied here is at least partially an iron surface, since the measurements are carried out under UHV conditions where the surface may have lost some of its oxygen coverage in its passivation layer. The thickness of the passivation layer, estimated from four independent techniques by four sep- arate research groups, is only of the order of 3-4 atomic layers from the topmost surface layer [ 15 ], and thus may be lost quite easily. However, the results in [ 21 ] on K desorption from Fe surfaces have been found from the temperature-pro- grammed desorption (TPD) results assuming a pre-exponential of 1013 s- 1, with no further verification. In studies of the kinetics of K desorption from iron and iron oxide surfaces [ 22,23 ], such an exponential value was almost never found. Only for a surface with a layer of adsorbed oxygen with a desorption barrier of 2.1 eV, a pre-exponential close to 1013 S-1 is observed. The very large changes in work function values on adsorption of K in Ref. [ 21 ], apparently down to the improbably low value of 1.0 eV (compared to numerous studies of alkali covered surfaces), also point towards a presence of oxygen on or in the iron surface. Thus, the lower 244 K. Engvall et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 239-246 observed activation energy for a fresh catalyst corresponds probably to emission from K20 or from an oxide-covered surface. The much lower activation energy of 164 kJ/mol for the potassium loss from the used catalyst indicates that the initial oxygen-bonded form of K is depleted to some extent. Perhaps the decrease in the total (BET) surface area of the used ammonia synthesis catalyst (8 m2/g, compared to 12 m2/g for the fresh one) also plays a role here, by increasing the segregation of K to the surface of the catalyst. The low value of the activation energy shows that a more covalent type of bonding exists in this case, and it is close to that for emission of excited K species in Ref. [8]. The results show that two different states of potassium exist in the fresh catalyst, and only one in the case of the used one. Since the activity of the iron catalyst for ammonia synthesis decreases gradually with the operation time over a few years [24], the better performance of the catalyst may perhaps be correlated to the more strongly bonded potassium promoter. The electron emission thermionic work function (derived from the Richardson- Dushman formula) for the two catalysts has also been determined by measuring the variation of the electron flux leaving the catalyst surface with temperature. For the fresh catalyst the work function is found to be 3.94+0.15 eV and for the used one 1.67 + 0.14 eV. These values indicate that in both cases potassium promoter is present at the catalyst surface since for clean polycrystalline iron the work function is approximately 4.4 eV. The value for the used catalyst is lower than the value of 2.25 eV typical for a pure K surface, and cannot be due to a coverage only by K. This result indicates clearly that oxygen exists on the surface, presumably as K20, which may give a very low work function. Lee et al. [ 25 ] have shown experimen- tally that adsorption Of K on single crystal Fe surfaces causes a very pronounced lowering of the work function. For industrial ammonia synthesis catalyst, Weiss and Ertl [26] have shown from a scanning Auger electron microscopy study that the promoters A1, K, and Ca are strongly enriched at the surface; A1203 and CaO tend to form separate particles and thus act as structural promoters, while K covers more or less uniformly the Fe areas. Ertl et al. [27,28] also showed that reduction of the catalyst transforms Fe completely into its metallic state; the iron particles are uniformly covered by a K + O adlayer which acts as an electronic promoter. Mahdi et al. [ 29 ] have further confirmed the above results from XPS, ion scattering spectroscopy (ISS) and catalytic performance at 1 bar pressure of both model systems and industrial doubly promoted iron catalysts. Most recent XPS studies by Perov [30], reported in 1995, are also in full conformity with the above picture. The chemical state of potassium is closely related to its distribution over the catalyst surface. The distribution of the promoters changes significantly during the reduction process and the subsequent reaction of ammonia synthesis [ 25-30]. The lower activation energy for potassium desorption is consistent with the higher signal intensity for the used catalyst (which in the low temperature range is one order of magnitude higher than for the fresh catalyst). This fact and the significantly K. Engvall et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 239-246 245 lower value of work function for the used catalyst support the view that surface segregation phenomena take place during the industrial process. This is in broad agreement with the conclusions from surface spectroscopic studies by Ertl and coworkers [25-29] and Perov [30]. The kinetics of the potassium emission process was also studied in our group [ 23 ] by the field reversal technique in another UHV chamber. Here for the fresh catalyst two desorption barriers for potassium were found from Arrhenius plots of the rate constants, namely 203 + 9 (2.10 eV) and 315 + 14 kJ/mol (3.3 eV). Due to the low work function, the energy of neutral desorption was probably measured even when the ion signal was followed, as can be concluded from the theory for surface ionization, e.g. in Ref. [ 31 ]. While the lower barrier differs considerably from the present results, the second one agrees within the error limits with the highest barrier determined by us in the steady state measurements completed in this study. 4. Concluding remarks The surface ionization method can be applied to investigate the surface state of the alkali promoter in real catalytic systems. It proves to be useful in characterizing the different potassium states in the iron catalyst for ammonia synthesis, where the states in fresh and used catalysts can be distinguished by the differences in their activation energies for desorption. Comparing the results for the fresh and used catalysts it can be concluded that the chemical nature of potassium changes during the industrial process. The lower activation energy determined for the used catalyst may be caused by the segregation of potassium from the bulk to the surface due to the decreased iron area in the catalyst, which results in the shift in the bond character from ionic to the more covalent one. The very low work function for the used catalyst confirms this tenet. The above results are in broad agreement with those obtained by other investigators from surface spectroscopic studies (XPS, AES, and ISS) on both single crystal Fe surfaces and on real industrial ammonia synthesis catalysts [ 25-30]. More data, particularly for model catalysts, are needed to identify the desorption energies for K from different compounds or phases present in such a complex system as the ammonia synthesis catalyst. The present surface ionization study, as also our earlier molecular beam studies on this system, shows the type of infor- mation which can be obtained about the physicochemical properties of the potas- sium promoter species. Hence this method could also be of interest for the new iron-free supported ruthenium catalyst for ammonia synthesis, for which the pro- motion effect of potassium is reported to be even more pronounced [ 32,33 ]. 246 K.

Industrial ammonia synthesis catalysts, as fresh (pre-reduced and passivated) and used (passivated) flat samples were studied in a molecular beam UHV apparatus, using a surface ionization detector. The desorption of the K promoter from the catalyst at 870–1080 K could be characterized, by measuring angular distributions and simultaneous Arrhenius plots, as a function of the angle around the sample. The two activation energies observed for K desorption from the fresh catalyst were 260 kJ/mol (2.7 eV) and 330 kJ/mol (3.4 eV); the used catalyst had only one, much smaller activation barrier at 164 kJ/mol (1.70 eV). The chemical state of potassium in the catalyst changes from a stronger bound ionic, probably in the form of FeOK, to a weaker, more covalent one during the industrial process. A large difference in work functions between the fresh (3.9 eV) and used (1.7 eV) catalyst was observed. This seems to be due to formation of K oxides on the surface of the used catalyst, caused by enrichment of potassium at the surface during the industrial use.
