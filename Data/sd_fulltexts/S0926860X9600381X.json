Complex mixtures containing conjugated and unconjugated acetylcyclohexenes together with other products arising from the formal addition of hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, acetyl chloride and acetic anhydride to the C=C double bond were generally obtained. Mor and ZSM-5 were found to be less active but more selective catalysts than Y and 13. These results have been compared with those achieved using silica-alumina (25%), phosphotungstic acid (HPW) supported on silica, and A1C13. Silica-alumina does not catalyze the acetylation of cyclohexene with acetyl chloride, while phosphotungstic acid was found to be less active than tridirectional, large pore zeolites. In the case of A1CI3, acetylchlorocyclohexanes were the main products. Kinetics of the acetylation for lb established that the /3,'y-unsaturated 6-acetyt-l-methylcyclohexene was the primary product, which undergoes subsequent rearrangement to the thermodynamically more stable 1-acetyl-2-methylcyclohexene. In contrast, la affords exclusively the c~,/3-unsaturated 1- acetylcyclohexene. Based on semiempirical hamiltonians AM1 quantum chemical calculations of the optimum chair conformation of the corresponding carbocationic intermediates, this different behavior of cyclohexene and 1-methylcyclohexene has been interpreted in terms of stereoelectronic control owing to the lack of an axial a hydrogen in the intermediate derived from l- methylcyclohexene.

Introduction Acylation of aliphatic alkenes with carboxylic acid derivatives is an interesting process from a synthetic point of view since the resulting unsaturated ketones are versatile intermediates in the preparation of more elaborated complex molecules through conjugated Michael addition or as dienophiles for Diels-Alder cycloaddi- tions. Acylation of cycloalkenes with carboxylic acids in the presence of Br6nsted acids such as polyphosphoric acid [1,2] or, alternatively, with acyl chlorides or anhydrides using a variety of Lewis acids and, in particular, aluminium trichloride [3-9] and zinc dichloride [10-12] is an old process that can be found extensively documented in the chemical literature [13-15]. However, the synthetic utility of this reaction is largely limited at the present by the formation of considerable amounts of by-products accompanying to the desired acylation product. Thus, the use of AIC13 usually leads to mixtures of c~,/3 and/3,~/-unsaturated ketones together with large quantities of chloro ketones arising from chloride quenching of carbocationic intermediates. On the other hand, polyphosphoric acid can promote other processes besides the acylation such as cyclization, aromatization, dehydra- tion and Meerwein-Wagner rearrangements. The search for more selective catalysts [16,17] and/or new acylating reagents [18] continues to attract interest in order to fully exploit the synthetic potential of this simple process. Zeolites are widely used as catalysts for multi-ton processes in the petrochemical industry [ 19]. The application of these microporous crystalline aluminosilicates as catalysts for the production of fine chemicals [20,21] or in general organic reactions [22] constitutes an active area of research. In particular, much effort is being devoted to the replacement of conventional Lewis acids by zeolites as catalysts for the aromatic Friedel-Crafts acylation [23]. In general, it has been found that acid zeolites do not possess sites of strength enough to catalyze the reaction of carboxylic acids with non-activated arenes in the liquid-phase at moderate temperatures. Thus, catalysis of aromatic Friedel-Crafts acylation by zeolites appears to be limited to electron-rich arenes using acyl chlorides. For example, HY and HI3 were found to be active for the acylation of anisole by phenylacetyl or 3-phenylpropanoyl chlorides [24,25]. It has been concluded that other superacid solids would be more suitable as general catalysts for Friedel- Crafts aromatic acylation [26]. Taking into account that C=C double bonds are generally more reactive than aromatic hydrocarbons, we anticipate a better suitability of zeolites for the aliphatic C=C double bond acylation. In principle, the use of zeolites would allow to gain control on the chemoselectivity of the reaction by choosing the appropriate micropore dimension and topology of the zeolite as well as the acid strength distribution of the sites. In the present work, we report an exploratory study of the liquid-phase acylation of cyclohexene (la) and 1-methylcyclohexene (lb) with acetyl chloride and anhydride in the presence of acid zeolites. The product distributions achieved E. Armengol et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 323-335 325 are compared with those obtained using silica-alumina, supported phosphotungs- tic acid (HPW) or A1C13. In addition, molecular modeling has been used to interpret the different C=C double bond regioselectivity observed for la and lb. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts Y zeolites with different percentages of Na+-to-H+ exchange (HY-21, HY-50 and HY-100, where the number indicates the H+ percent) were prepared starting from commercial NaY (SK-40, Union Carbide) by consecutive treatments at room temperature with aqueous solutions of ammonium acetate at increasing concen- trations using a solid-to-liquid ratio 1-to-10 and subsequent deep-bed calcination as reported elsewhere [27]. HY-D (Si/A1=27.5, unit cell size 24.26 A), H-Mor (Si/AI=10) and HZSM-5 (Si/A1=37.5) were supplied by PQ Industries (CBV-760, CBV-20A and CBV- 8020, respectively). H~3 (Si/AI=I3) was obtained by thermal decomposition (773 K, N2 stream, 24 h) of the tetraethylammonium form of an as-synthesized sample prepared according to the literature [28]. Some relevant physicochemical parameters of these zeolites are contained in Table 1. HPW (60%)-SIO2 and HPW (50%)-SIO2 (containing 60% and 50% in weight of phosphotungstic acid from Aldrich, respectively) were prepared from BASF inert silica as support. The acid was dissolved in water and silica was added. The suspension was stirred while water was slowly evacuated at 60 under reduced pressure and finally dried at 100 for 1 h. 2.2. Reaction procedure The catalyst (1.00 g) previously dehydrated (for zeolites: 500, overnight; for heteropoly acids 300 for 2 h under 1 Torr) was added to a solution of the corresponding cycloalkene (cyclohexene from Fluka, purity >95%; 1-methyl- cyclohexene from Aldrich, purity >97%. Both were used as received) (25 mmol) Table 1 Main physicochemical parameters of the zeolites used in this work Zeolite Si/A1 molar ratio Unit cell size (A) NaO2 content (%) BET surface area (m2 i) HY-21 2.4 24.70 10.4 810 HY-50 2.4 24.70 6.6 790 HY- 100 2.6 24.54 <0.01 750 HY-D 27.5 24.26 0.03 720 H~3 13 -- 0.02 600 HMor 10 -- 0.02 550 HZSM-5 37.5 -- 0.01 430 326 E. Armengol et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 323-335 and acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride. Unless otherwise indicated, the molar ratio cyclohexene-to-acylating agent was 1-to-2. The suspension was magnetically stirred in a round flask adapted with a condenser fitted with a tube of anhydrous calcium chloride to avoid ambient moisture. The reaction temperature was controlled using a thermostated bath and the stiring speed was 400 cycles min-l. Nitrobenzene (100 mg) was added as internal standard. A control experiment (entry 4 in Table 3) carried out in the absence of nitrobenzene proved that this reference does not substantially alter the product distribution and selectivities. The course of the reaction was periodically followed by analyzing the organic phase using a HP 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 25 m capillary column of 5% crosslinked phenylmethylsilicone. For the chromatographic analyses, the initial oven temperature (60) was maintained for 3 min, followed by a temperature increase of 20 min-~. At the end of the reaction, the solid was filtered and submitted to exhaustive solid-liquid extraction using a micro-Soxhlet equipment and dichloromethane as solvent. The organic phases (from the reaction and the catalyst extraction) were separately concentrated under vacuum, weighed and analyzed by gas chromato- graphy (GC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (Varian Saturn II, same column and conditions as GC), 300 MHz I H-nuclear magnetic resonance (IH-NMR) (Varian Geminis, CDC13 as solvent, TMS as internal standard) and gas chromatography-infrared spectrophotometry (GC-FTIR) (HP 5890 gas chroma- tograph, same column as GC, equipped with a FTIR HP 5965A detector). Spectroscopic properties of 1-acetylcyclohexene (2a), 1-acetyl-2-methylcyclohex- ene (2b) and 6-acetyl- 1-methylcyclohexene (3b) were identical to those previously reported [ 18,29]. 2.3.

Alternative synthesis of acetoxycyclohexanes (5a,b) To a solution of cyclohexenes la and lb (10 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (15 ml) was added acetic acid (10 mmol) and sulfuric acid (0.3 ml) as catalyst. The resulting mixture was stirred at reflux temperature for 4 h.

Alternative synthesis of cyclohexene dimers (8a, b) A solution of cyclohexenes la,b (10 mmol) in CH2C12 (10 ml) and CH3SO3H (0.2 ml) was stirred at reflux temperature for 4 h. The products obtained in these acid catalyzed dimerizations were found to exhibit identical GC retention time and GC-MS and GC-FTIR spectra as those compounds assigned to dimers 8a,b detected in the acetylation reaction of cyclohexenes la and lb. 3. Results and discussion Acetylation of cyclohexenes la,b in the presence of acid zeolites affords in general complicated mixtures of acetyl derivatives 2a,b and 3a,b, accompanied with variable amounts of compounds arising from HCI (4a,b) and HAcO (5a,b) addition to the C=C double bond (Scheme 1). Other minor products, such as those arising from the formal addition to the starting materials of AcC1 (6a,b) or Ac20 (7a,b) and the corresponding dimers (Sa,b), were also observed in the reaction mixtures. The results obtained in the acetylation of cyclohexenes la and lb by acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride in the presence of the series of catalysts studied are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Since one equivalent of HC1 is stoichiometrically generated during the formation of compounds 2 and 3 from AcC1, its subsequent addition to the C=C double bond leading to chlorocyclohexanes 4 lowers the overall selectivity to acetylation products (2+3). We attemped to quench the formation of compounds 4, by trapping HC1 with bulky 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine or sodium hydrogencarbonate, but no changes in the selectivity of the process were observed (entry 2 in Table 2)l. In agreement with what is known about the reactivity of carboxylic acid derivatives, acetic anhydride exhibits lower reactivity than acetyl chloride under the same reaction conditions. However, the higher boiling point of the anhydride allowed to perform the reaction at temperatures above 50 (acetyl chloride boiling point), thus resulting in higher overall conversions. Worth noting is the change in the product selectivity from cyclohexene to l- methylcyclohexene using acetic anhydride as acylating reagent. Thus, while starting from cyclohexene, the selectivities of acetylcyclohexene 2a and acetox- ycyclohexane 5a were similar (entries 5 and 6 in Table 2), aliphatic Friedel-Crafts acylation was the overwhelming predominant process for 1-methylcyclohexene lb. In fact, the highest conversion of lb (86%) and selectivity to the /3,-y- unsaturated acetylcyclohexene 3b (83%) was obtained by using acetic anhydride in the presence of HY-D as catalyst (entry 5 in Table 3). This change in product selectivity from cyclohexene to 1-methylcyclohexene can be interpreted as the IA referee has suggested that the evolved HC1 may also influence the crystallinity and dealumination degree of the catalyst. No check for this likely possibility has been done in this work. 328 E.

Thus, while the complex of acetic anhydride with the zeolite acid sites would be independent on the substrate, this complex would be electrophilic enough to react with lb but apparently not with la. With regard to the influence of the zeolite structure, it can be concluded from Tables 2 and 3, that medium pore sized ZSM-5 or large pore size, monodirectional Mor are less active than tridirectional Y and [3 zeolites, under similar experimental conditions. However, with regard to the selectivity to acetylcyclohexene 2a, the plots of product selectivity versus cyclohexene conversion shows that ZSM-5 and Mor exhibited higher selectivity than tridirectional zeolites (Fig. 1).

This has to be related with the similar molecular size both of the reagents and products involved in all these reactions. From results of Tables 2 and 3, it also worth noting the comparative performance of zeolite catalysts with respect to other heterogeneous solids and AIC13. Thus, while silica-alumina (25%) was inefficient to catalyze the acetylation of cyclo- hexene la (entry 8 in Table 2), acetylation of lb under the same conditions does occur in the presence of this solid (entry 13 in Table 3) with high conversion. This reflects again the higher reactivity of 1-methylcyclohexene to undergo electro- philic attacks. Phosphotungstic acid supported on silica (entries 9 in Table 2 and 14 and 15 in Table 3) showed an activity lower than tridirectional Y and [3 zeolites, especially for the acetylation of cyclohexene la. However, the most remarkable fact in Tables 2 and 3 is the different product distribution achieved using A1C13 as catalyst, whereby acetylchlorocyclohexanes 6a,b (four isomers from la) are the predominant products (entries 10 in Table 2 and 16 in Table 3). As inspection of Tables 2 and 3 shows, these compounds 6a,b are almost absent carrying out the reaction in the presence of non-chlorinated catalysts. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the chloro atoms does not come from the acylating reagent AcC1 but from AIC13. On the other hand, the fact that up to four isomers are detected for la indicates that besides the obvious trans and cis stereoisomers of 1-acetyl-2- chlorocyclohexanes, chlorine migration through other positions of the cyclohexane 332 E. Armengol et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 323-335 ring has also occurred. Since the exact structural identification is not relevant in our study, we did not pursue it further although we are aware that this type of chlorine shifts to the 4-position of the cyclohexane ring have been reported previously for the reaction of benzoyl chloride with cyclohexene [3] and other cycloalkenes [5] in the presence of A1C13. R ~Ac C I.~Ac (trans and cis) (possibility of stereoisomers) Concerning the structure of the acetylcyclohexenes 2 and 3, it has been found using ZnC12 that the fl,3,-unsaturated ketone 3-acetylcyclohexene 3a is the primary product arising from the electrophilic attack of acylium-like intermediates [ 10]. This primary non-conjugated acetylcyclohexane 3a may be stable under the reaction conditions or, most commonly at high concentrations of strong acid catalyst, rearranges to the thermodynamically more stable c~,fl-conjugated ketone 2a. Under our reaction conditions, we have been unable to detect the isomer 3a (see Table 2). This situation contrasts with the behavior that we have observed for the acetyl derivatives of 1-methylcyclohexene. Thus, we have observed for all the heterogeneous catalysts that compound 3b is a primary but unstable product that rearranges under the reaction conditions to the conjugated isomer 2b. As an example, Fig. 2 presents the yield-conversion plot for the case of the reaction in the presence of HY-100. Although isomerization of 3b into 2b was found to be a general process for all the catalysts, there is a clear relationship between the acid strength distribution and the crystalline structure of the zeolite and the ease of the isomerization. Partially exchanged HY-21 and HY-50 zeolites were much more selective to 3b. On the other hand, we observed a much higher selectivity to 3b for ZSM-5 and Mor than for HY-100 and [3 zeolites. We believe that the effect of the crystalline structure has to be related to the steric constraints imposed by the framework to the absorption of 3b and/or to adopt the appropriate conformation of intermediate 9b leading to 2b. We were intrigued by the different ability of compounds 3a and 3b to undergo C=C bond migration to compounds 2a and 2b, respectively. In a seminal work based on the lack of deuterium kinetic isotope effect while there is a product isotope effect, Beak and coworkers have proved that the mechanism of the acylation of cycloalkenes involves a carbocationic intermediate 9 as indicated in Scheme 2111]. Therefore, the different behavior of 3a and 3b has to be related with stereoelectronic effects introduced by the presence of a methyl group at the 2- position of the cyclohexane chair conformation.

Yield versus conversion of 6-acetyl-l-methylcyclohene (3b, curve a) and l-acetyl-2-methylcyclohex- ene (2b, curve b) using HY-100 as catalyst. Compound 3b is a primary but unstable product, while 2b arises as secondary product. In order to address this question, we have carried out semiempirical quantum chemical calculations [32] to determine the optimized conformation of inter- mediates 9a and 9b. The results are presented in Fig. 3. Inspection of this Figure shows that in 9a both the a and 3' positions possesses an axial hydrogen and, therefore, optimum overlap between the empty Pz orbital of the carbenium center and the incipient p orbital that develops as the H+ starts to leave can occur with H in c~ and 3'. In contrast, in the case of 9b interaction between the methyl and acetyl substituents forces to the latter to occupy an axial disposition and, as consequence, the axial c~ H is missing. Stereoelectronic control would make much difficult the removal of the equatorial c~ H than the axial 3/H, and, hence, the latter is preferently removed from the optimum conformation of 9b. This simple model explains why it is much more favorable to reach the o~,fl-conjugated 2a from 9a than 2b from 9b. 4. Conclusions Acetylation of cyclohexenes catalyzed by acid zeolites gives rise to acetylcy- clohexenes in low to moderate selectivities. In order to fully develop the synthetic potential of this reaction, it is necessary to quench the by-products arising from HC1 addition. Nevertheless, for 1-methylcyclohexene using Ac20 as acylating reagent, it was found that HY-D and Hfl exhibit good conversion and high selectivity. Cyclohexene affords exclusively the o~,fl-conjugated 1-acetylcyclohex- 334 E. Armengol et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 323-335 A ? [ Pz H? I-I? Fig. 3.

Note that while 9a posseses an axial ~x H, this is missing in 9b. To visualize the stereoelectronic control, the empty Pz orbital has been drawn in A. ene, while the primary compound from 1-methylcyclohexene was the non-con- jugated/3,7-unsaturated 6-acetyl-l-methylcyclohexene. We have provided semi- empirical calculations of the optimized conformation of corresponding carbocationic intermediate 9, to invoke a stereoelectronic control (preferential elimination of axial hydrogens) in the product formation.

Fax: +34 6 3877809 Treatment of cyclohexene (1a) and 1-methylcyclohexene (1b) with acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride has been carried out in the presence of a series of acid zeolites including Y, β Mor and ZSM-5. Complex mixtures containing conjugated and unconjugated acetylcyclohexenes together with other products arising from the formal addition of hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, acetyl chloride and acetic anhydride to the CC double bond were generally obtained. Mor and ZSM-5 were found to be less active but more selective catalysts than Y and β. These results have been compared with those achieved using silica-alumina (25%), phosphotungstic acid (HPW) supported on silica, and AlCl3. Silica-alumina does not catalyze the acetylation of cyclohexene with acetyl chloride, while phosphotungstic acid was found to be less active than tridirectional, large pore zeolites. In the case of AlCl3, acetylchlorocyclohexanes were the main products. Kinetics of the acetylation for 1b established that the β,γ-unsaturated 6-acetyl-1-methylcyclohexene was the primary product, which undergoes subsequent rearrangement to the thermodynamically more stable 1-acetyl-2-methylcyclohexene. In contrast, 1a affords exclusively the α,β-unsaturated 1-acetylcyclohexene. Based on semiempirical hamiltonians AM1 quantum chemical calculations of the optimum chair conformation of the corresponding carbocationic intermediates, this different behavior of cyclohexene and 1-methylcyclohexene has been interpreted in terms of stereoelectronic control owing to the lack of an axial α hydrogen in the intermediate derived from 1-methylcyclohexene.
