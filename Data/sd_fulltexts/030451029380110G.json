I. YERMAKOV Institute of Catalysis, Novosibirsk 630090 (U.S.S.R.) Summary The state of the field of preparation of supported catalysts from organo- metallic precursors is reviewed. Methods of catalyst preparation based on the interaction of organometallic compounds with the surfaces of oxide supports may be used (a) to prepare catalytic sites with specific properties which cannot be obtained by conventional techniques and (b) to obtain samples with more homogeneous and more easily characterized surface compositions, with the view of using them to study the problems of fundamental catalysis. Examples are given of recent results of the application of organometallic compounds to prepare heterogeneous catalysts for olefin polymerization and to obtain supported metal and sulphide catalysts. Introduction The scope of this review is to discuss the current state of the field of preparation of supported catalyst using transition metal organometallic com- pounds. This field is considered as one of the trends in catalysis by anchored metal complexes. From the first increasing interest in catalytic applications of anchored complexes about dozen years ago, the following main separate fields of the preparation of immobilized complexes have evolved : (i) Use of organic polymers as supports. This field is closely connected with polymer chemistry. Ciardelli et al. [1] reviewed the recent results of development of this field. (ii) Use of graphite as a matrix for preparation of intercalation metal compounds. The lecture by Vol'pin on the state of this field [2] is most informative. (iii) Use of inorganic oxide carriers, the traditional supports for cata- lyst preparation. This field, in turn, is divided into two main areas: (1) Preparation of complexes anchored to surface functionalities bonded to the support surface by hydrocarbon chains. Functionalization of the support is performed either by treatment with the so-called binding - 0304-5102/83/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 36 agents (a typical example being (EtO^SHCH^nL, where L = PR;, NH;, SH, etc. [3]) or by multistep synthesis of functional groups on the surface [4]. Binding metal complexes to surface ligands was mainly used for synthesis of heterogenized complexes which are analogues of known homogeneous cata- lytic systems. But a study of such heterogenized complexes revealed certain limitations of this approach for catalytic applications. Relatively mild con- ditions (temperatures usually < 100 C) may be used to perform catalytic reactions; under more severe conditions, complexes usually decompose (likely due to the breakage of the attached surface ligand), and catalysis is performed by products of complex decomposition (sometimes by metal particles). In liquid phase reactions, it is difficult to prevent the leaching of anchored complexes. One may conclude that the development of this area resulted in numerous descriptions of the synthesis of well-characterized individual anchored complexes (including anchored clusters), while catalytic results are relatively modest (they are mainly claims of the occurrence of the known catalytic reaction). Catalytic systems of this type seem to be rather far from real practical application. (2) Formation of surface complexes bonded to surface oxygen ions. Materials obtained via the interaction of transition element organometallic compounds with nonfunctionalized oxide surfaces have no direct analogues among homogeneous catalysts and represent a variation of heterogeneous catalytic systems. However, approaches of 'molecular catalysis' are involved in their preparation. Such catalysts are obtained either by interaction of compounds of type MR^Xn (where M is a transition metal, R an organic (non-carbonyl) ligand and X another substituent, often a halogenide) with hydroxyl groups of an oxide support, or by supporting carbonyl clusters on the oxide surface. In this review we shall restrict ourselves to consideration of only this last area of catalysis by anchored complexes. As the data published by the end of 1980 are thoroughly considered in ref. [5], only recent results will be considered here. The use of non-carbonyl organometallic compounds will be primarily discussed, because the application of carbonyl complexes to cata- lyst preparation was reviewed recently [6] and is also a topic of one of the papers published in this volume [7]. A question may arise as to why it is necessary to use expensive and often unstable organometallic compounds of transition elements in catalyst preparation. Two answers may be proposed to justify this: (1) In the search to obtain surface sites with particular catalytic prop- erties promising for practical application, new catalytic properties may result from the formation of such surface compounds which are impossible to achieve by traditional methods of catalyst preparation. For example, by anchoring hydroborate complexes of titanium and zirconium as well as by hydrogen treatment of anchored benzyl or allyl complexes of these ele- ments, surface hydrides ^M H (where M may be ions of Ti or Zr in oxida- tion state III or IV) may be obtained [8, 9]. Such hydrides are direct pre- cursors of active centers for ethylene polymerization. Centers of such com- 37 position cannot be obtained by other methods (including the anchoring of chlorides of the same elements). Catalytic effects in the case of systems prepared by supporting organometallic compounds may appear due to the possibility of mixing catalyst components at the 'atomic' level, for example using heteronuclear clusters. It was shown that iron-manganese catalysts obtained by supporting mixed clusters demonstrate selectivities (lower yields of methane) in the synthesis of hydrocarbons from CO and H; different from those of catalysts prepared by traditional techniques [10,11]. (2) The possibility to obtain systems with more homogeneous surface compositions compared with heterogeneous catalysts prepared by traditional methods. Such systems may be used to study theoretical problems of hetero- geneous catalysis, such as elucidation of the composition and methods of formation of the active surface species, their reactivities, mechanisms of catalytic reactions, reasons for promoting effects of additives etc. [12]. If the study of such idealized systems reveals which surface sites are responsible for catalytic activity, then practical ways to obtain useful systems may be envisaged, and attempts to develop more applicable techniques of catalyst preparation may be made. In the following, catalytic properties of systems of various composition (those containing complexes bonded to surface oxygen ions and those con- taining dispersed metal and sulphide particles) prepared via the step of supporting organometallic compounds will be considered. Supported organometallic catalysts In this section systems containing surface organometallic compounds of the type (^ O ^MRy are considered, with the transition metal M being bonded to the oxygen of the support, and also systems containing species formed in transformations of surface organometallic compounds {e.g. as a result of hydrogen treatment), by which no cleavage of the bond between metal and oxygen of the support occurs. Major progress in catalytic applications of such systems has been made in ethylene polymerization. With the use of supported benzyl [13], allyl [13,14] and cyclopentadienyl [15] metal complexes for polymerization of ethylene and dienes, the study of supported organometallic catalysts began to be systematic. At present, active catalysts for ethylene polymerization are obtained by means of organometallic compounds of various elements (Table 1). The initial organometallic compounds in solution presented in Table 1 are not catalysts for ethylene polymerization. The activities of supported catalysts depend on many factors of their preparation the type of oxide support, its structural properties, the temperature of preliminary dehydra- tion of the carrier, etc. [8]. Supported catalysts derived from organometallic compounds of Ti, Cr, Zr and U may be prepared with activities satisfactory for practical application. Industrial production of high density polyethylene is performed with catalyst systems prepared by the interaction of Cr(C5Hs)2 38 TABLE 1 Various organometallic compounds of MR.,, type used to prepare oxide-supported cata- lysts for ethylene polymerization Ti: Ti(CH2C,,Hs)4 (a), Ti[CHiSi(CH3)3]4 (a), Ti(C.,Hii)4 (a), Ti(BH4)3 (a) V: V^-CaH^Oa) Cr: Cr(li3-C3H5)3 (a), Cr^-CsHs); (a), Cr(CeH6)(CO)3(la) Zr: Zr(li3-C3Hs)4 (a), Zr(CH2C(,Hs)4 (a), Zr(^}3-C4H7)4 (a) Zr[CH2Si(CH3)3]4 (a), Zr[CH2C(CH3)3]4 (a), Zr(BH4)4 (a), ZrICii^Cii^C^lis^ (a) Nb: Nb(173-C3H5)3 (la) Y, Er: M(T?5-C5H4R)CH3 (la) (M: Y, Er) Hf: Hf(r;3-C^H5)3 (la), Hf(CH:iC6Hs)4 (la), Hf(BH4)4 (la) U: U(BH4)4(a) aThe level of activity at 80 C is shown in parentheses: (a) active catalysts were prepared by supporting the given organometallic compound on Si0i or Al^Os, with activity in the range 100 -1000 g C2H4/mmol M\"1 h-1 atm~1; (la) low-activity catalyst (<100 g C^H.^ mmol M-1 h-1 atm-1). with SiO^. Polymerization takes place in the gas phase at 95 -105 C and 25 atm. After 4 h of catalyst residence in the reactor the yield of polymer is as great as 5000 g/g of catalyst (4.5 X 10s mol g-atom\"1 of Cr). However, the catalyst obtained by supporting [(C6Hs)3SiO]2Cr02 on SiO; is also used for this process. The advantage in preparing polymerization catalysts by the anchoring of organometallic compounds is the versatility of directed control of the composition of active centers (and therefore their reactivity). The composi- tion of the active center in these systems may be presented by the following general formula: / CH^CH^CHiCH^),, CH3 [^E-OLM( ^ For such catalysts it is possible to control the composition of the active centers (and therefore their reactivity) by changing the transition metal M and its oxidation state, the nature of the element E which forms an oxide, and the ligand L entering the composition of the organometallic compound to be supported. Thus the molecular mass of polymer, determined by the 39 ratio of the propagation rate constant and the rate constant characteristic of the prevailing transfer reaction, may be regulated over a wide range [8]. The number of active centers usually corresponds to only a fraction of the overall content of supported metal. To form active centers, it appears necessary to produce the coordinatively unsaturated state of the supported ion. Heating of catalysts, treatment with hydrogen, or UV radiation leads to removal of organic ligands from the anchored complex and usually results in an increase in the activity. Under optimal conditions of treatment, the number of active polymerization centers in supported organometallic catalysts may be as much as 20 - 40% of the supported metal [8]. Consider some recent results of the study of supported organometallic catalysts for polymerization. Active catalysts were obtained by anchoring tetrakis(l-bicycloheptyl)titanium, Ti(C.7Hii)4, on alumina [16]. Unlike tetra- benzyltitanium interacting with various surface hydroxyl groups [13], Ti(C7Hn)4 reacts only with the most active ones, characterized by the IR band at 3780 cm\"1. The content of titanium in supported catalysts is there- fore low (~ 0.3 - 0.4%), but the catalysts show a high activity per mole of Ti (up to 1.3 X 105 g C2H4/mol Ti h atm). The role of diffusional limitations in the preparation of ethylene polymerization catalysts via supporting of tetra- (neophyl)zirconium on alumina has been analyzed in ref. [17]. A study of samples obtained by anchoring hydroborate complexes of Ti, Zr, Hf and U on oxide supports has been performed by Nesterov, Zakharov, and co- workers [18-21]. Zirconium-containing catalysts on alumina were found to be the most active. Supporting Zr(BH4)4 on alumina results in the dis- appearance of absorption bands in the A^Oa IR spectrum, corresponding to the disappearance of hydroxyl groups (3740 and 3780 cm\"1) and in the formation of surface complexes containing M^^B-H fragments (absorp- tion in the range 2050 - 2200 cm~1 for bridge obnds Zr H B and 2700 - 2600 cnT1 for terminal bonds B H): (^Al-OHL +M(BH)^ ^Al-OLM(BH4L-n +\"^+^3 (1) Za Part of the BHa evolved is removed as diborane; another part interacts with hydroxyl groups of Al^Oa. Surface hydroborate complexes were found not to interact with ethylene, and cause no polymerization. Active surface hy- drides of zirconium are produced only by the decomposition of tetrahydro- borate complexes with catalyst heating to 100 - 250 C, for example: /11 ( ^E-0)2Zr(BH4)2 > ( p-O^Zr. + BHa (2) \\BH4) Surface hydrides containing Zr H fragments induce ethylene polymeriza- tion. In contrast to soluble hydride complexes of zirconium, surface hy- drides are thermally very stable: absorption bands in the IR spectrum corre- sponding to Zr H fragments (at 1665 and 1975 cm\"1 for silica-supported Zr complexes and at 1925 cm\"1 for alumina-supported Zr complexes) remain 40 after heating of the catalysts to 300 C. Similar results were observed for the systems Ti(BH4)3/Al203 and Hf(BH4)4/Al2C>3. This explains ethylene poly- merization on such catalysts at high temperatures (200 - 250 C) with the formation of linear polymers. The high stability of surface hydrides appears to be due to the lack of decomposition caused by bimolecular interactions. When supported organometallic catalysts containing Ti(III) and Zr(III) ions in the active center were studied using ESR techniques, separate stages in the polymerization process were distinguished: Coordination of ethylene: C2H4.-150 C j>c IM-H + C2H4 ( ^M. (3) ^ Ethylene insertion into the M H bond: C^. C 20 C > ^M-CH^CHa (4) H Transfer with hydrogenation: +H2 lM-CH2CH2(C2H4),.C2Hs > M-H + CH3CH2(CH2CH2),.C2Hs (5) Data obtained recently by ^ NMR [19] also confirm the presence of the stage of preliminary coordination of ethylene on Zr(IV) ions. By the ESR technique it was shown [22] that CO reversibly coordi- nates to Ti(III) ions of the surface benzyl complexes ^^TK^CeHs and ^ 0 Ti(CH2C6H5)2 at 77 K. With an increase in temperature, insertion into the Ti C bond proceeds. It was found that surface titanium hydride com- plexes are more reactive in the interaction with CO. Their irreversible trans- formation at 77 K was observed [22]; it is probable that formyi complexes are formed in the following reaction: \"^ I ,Ti-H+CO ^ -<y / -0\\ /CH >< II (6) -O^ ^0 A detailed study of such a process may be of interest in connection with the problem of CO activation and with the possibility of comparing the reactivities of surface complexes with the data obtained from the study of reactions of carbon monoxide with individual hydride complexes [23]. Besides olefin polymerization, supported organometallic catalysts are active in polymerization of dienes, oligomerization, metathesis, and hydro- genation of olefins [5]. Iwasawa et al. [24] performed a detailed study of metathesis catalysts, prepared by supporting allyl complexes on oxides. The effect of the nature of the support and the ligand environment of Mo and W ions on catalytic activity was investigated. It was shown (in agree- ment with earlier results [25]) that coordinatively unsaturated Mo\"1\"4 and 41 W\"1'4 ions in an oxygen environment prepared from organometallic precursors have the same high activity as the initially anchored metal allyl complexes. The high activity seems to be due to the formation of carbene species during the interaction of olefins with Mo\"*\"4 and W\"1\"4 ions, although the mechanism of this process remains unclear. Mo(IV) alkylidene species were proposed to be responsible for the activity of metathesis catalysts prepared by supporting Mo(CO)(,onAl203[26]. Supported organometallic catalysts for hydrogenation were prepared by anchoring Rh(C3H5)3 on silica [27]. It is stated that surface hydrides (for example ^Si-0 RhH(C3H5) and ISi ORh^\"), which are active centers for olefin hydrogenation, may be obtained from anchored ^Si 0 Rh(C3Hs)2 without breaking the bond with the support. Surface centers obtained by the hydrogen treatment of anchored organometallic complexes of Mo, W, Cr, and Zr catalyze the hydrogenation of olefins at low temperatures ( 50 to 100 C) 16]. It was shown recently [28a] that paired centers of aluminium oxide o^ \"^p o^crs' q prepared via anchoring binuclear complex Cr2(l?3-C3H5)4 are the most active. The high activity and stability of such centers is likely to be accounted for by the participation of two neighbouring ions of Cr\"1'2 in the catalytic act. Catalytic effects due to the possible paired location of supported molybdenum ions were also observed for samples prepared by anchoring [Mo(C3H5)2]i [28b] and [Mo(OC2H5)s]2 [29a, b] on oxide supports. A systematic study of catalytic effects associated with the close location of two (or more) ions on the catalyst surface could be of great interest. Preparation of such binuclear (in the general case, polynuclear) active centers is quite possible via anchor- ing of metal complexes, yet this potentially interesting area of catalyst syn- thesis is practically untouched. Preparation of dispersed metallic catalysts by decomposition of organo- metallic compounds on the support Dispersed metal particles of Ni, Pd, and Pt on oxide supports may be obtained by the decomposition of anchored allyl complexes of these metals [29]: agglomeration ^/\"CW ^ O7 M. i^\"*-^ Q/ ^ (7) y / / / / / / ^ ^ ^ / / / / ////r/^/^^f//////// Data characterizing the dispersion and catalytic properties of catalysts ob- tained this way were reviewed earlier [31]. This method of preparation of metal particles appears to provide the maximum metal dispersion character- istic of a metal-support system and for a given temperature of catalyst treat- ment. Recently obtained EXAFS data [32a, b] for Ni and Pt catalysts pre- pared by this technique provide evidence of the formation of surface clusters containing several metal atoms. A fairly uniform size distribution of metal 42 particles may be considered to be another characteristic peculiar to such catalysts. The properties of supported palladium [33a, b] and nickel [34] catalysts prepared from their allyl complexes were studied in detail by Carturan et al. In these studies, the formation of dispersed (< 30 A) palla- dium particles was shown, and the effects of metal dispersion on catalytic properties in the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene were found [33b]. The possibility to prepare supported metallic catalysts using solvated metal atoms in organic media was recently shown by Klabunde et al. [35]. Catalytic properties of samples prepared by this technique were less depen- dent on the nature of the oxide support than those of conventionally pre- pared samples. The metal dispersion data show, however, that such a tech- nique does not lead to the formation of ultradispersed metal particles. The decomposition of metal carbonyls on oxide carriers extends the sphere of use of organometallic precursors, because mono- or polynuclear carbonyls are available for many transition metals. The interactions of metal carbonyls with oxide surfaces and during their further transformations have been intensively studied recently. The mechanisms of these reactions and the types of surface species formed for the specific metal carbonyl-oxide sup- port system depends mainly on the hydroxyl group content of the support, determined by the temperature of its dehydration, and on the concentration of the supported metal carbonyl. When the number of metal carbonyls is not greater than the number of surface hydroxyl groups, decarbonylation leads mainly to the formation of metal ions, but not metal particles [36] : n( 1-OH) + M(CO), > ( ^-O\"-1)^\"1- + (n/2)H2 + ]CO (8) When greater amounts of metal carbonyl are introduced into the pores of the support, the formation of metal particles is also possible as a result of decarbonylation in vacuum. Dispersed metal particles are formed from sup- ported metal carbonyls and their decomposition products upon treatment in H;. The processes occurring during decomposition of carbonyl complexes to give metal particles have been studied in most detail for Rh [37], Ru [38], Os [39] and Ir [40]. The principal question of interest for those who search for new catalysts is certainly whether it is possible to achieve a system with better catalytic properties by metal carbonyl decomposition than by conventional methods of catalyst preparation. However, most of the detailed characterization data for supported carbonyls and related surface organo- metallic chemistry were determined by IR techniques. There are few results of comparisons of the catalytic properties of systems derived from metal carbonyl decomposition with those prepared conventionally. However, some data reveal the possibility of obtaining specific catalytic properties by de- composition of supported clusters under fairly mild conditions. Ichikawa's efforts [41] to obtain metal-cluster-derived catalysts for synthesis of oxygen- containing products from CO and Hz are well recognized. Indeed, for this reaction, the properties of catalysts prepared via supported carbonyls and by conventional impregnation techniques may be different. A comparison of two methods of preparation of rhodium catalysts is shown in Fig. 1. The 43 yield of alcohoJs.wt'j; Activity, mol;g-atom.Rh-S lQ5 Fig. 1. Comparison of properties of supported rhodium catalysts prepared by different techniques [47] for use in the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide at 250 C and 1 atm with 00:112=1:2. ^ Rh4(CO)u/La2C>3 after supported cluster was decomposed at 180 C; Rh content\" 1.12 wt.%. D RhCla/La^Oa; catalyst prereduced at 250 C; L&^Os precalcined at 300 C; BET surface area 33 m2 g~1; Rh content 0.5 wt.%. activity of samples obtained from Rh4(CO)i2 is seen to be higher, due to the higher rate of methanol formation. But note that when supported catalysts were prepared from RhCl3, considerable differences in catalytic prop- erties were observed, depending on conditions of pretreatment of the sup- ported RhC^ [42]. For catalysts prepared by supporting metal carbonyls, higher selectivity for olefins in the CO + H; reaction was found when Fe3(CO)i3 [43], KFe(CO)4 [44], and H4Ru3(CO)i2 [45] were used as precursors of metal particles. Cata- lysts prepared by supporting Ru3(CO)i2 were used for studying the effect of metal particle dispersion on the catalytic properties in the CO + H; reaction, and it was found that olefin yield increased (with a simultaneous drastic de- crease in activity) when the dispersion of the metal particles became greater than 0.7, probably due to strong metal-support interactions [46]. Preparation of supported cobalt catalysts from Co2(CO)s may result in positive catalytic effects [48]. By rapid pyrolysis of Co2(CO)g on various supports, dispersed particles of cobalt are obtained [48b]; superparamag- netic properties and a narrow ferromagnetic resonance signal were specific for these particles. In hydrogenation of CO, hydrogenolysis of the C C bond and olefin hydroformylation, such samples show elevated catalytic activity (Table 2). Several reasons for the differences in catalytic properties of supported metal particles prepared by the decomposition of carbonyls and by the con- ventional technique (except for the possible difference in dispersion) may be proposed: (a) The retention of a part of the supported metal in the oxidized state. Low-valent surface ions may play the role of stabilizing centers for dispersed metal particles via the mechanism proposed to explain the modification of properties by ions specially introduced into the catalytic system [12]. The possibility of stabilizing dispersed Ru particles derived from Ru3(CO)i2 on nonreduced ruthenium ions was recently considered [38c]. 44 TABLE 2 Catalytic properties of dispersed cobalt particles prepared by rapid pyrolysis of Co^COIg on TiOi surfaces Catalytic reaction Activity Relative activity\" / mol reagent \\ I g-atom of Co s, Hydrogenation of CO at 180 C, 9 X 10-4 latm;CO:H2=0.5 Hydrogenolysis of C^ at 250 C 4.8 X 10-4 Hydroformylation of €3^ at 150 C 0.80 X 10-4 and 3 atm11 10 30 c \"Activity (per g-atom of supported Co) related to activity of catalysts prepared by a con- ventional method (impregnation by an aqueous solution of Co(NOa)2). b Selectivity to straight-chain products ~ 85%. \"Catalysts prepared by conventional methods were not active under the same reaction conditions. (b) The effect of carbon formed by the decomposition of supported carbonyls. This possible reason was mentioned by Guczi et al. [49] to explain the higher activity in CO hydrogenation of systems prepared by the decomposition of Ru3(CO)i2 and Fe3(CO)i2 on silica. (c) The presence in conventionally prepared samples of non-metal ions from compounds used for impregnation (e.g. chloride ions), modifying the properties of these catalysts. However, detailed studies to explain the real reasons for the specific catalytic behaviour of metallic systems derived from metal carbonyl decomposition still need to be performed. The principal method for regulation of catalytic properties is to change the composition of the active centers. Therefore, the use of heteronuclear organometallic compounds for preparation of surface sites may be an in- teresting trend in the field of catalyst preparation. Some attempts to use heteronuclear clusters are known. An example of the application of Fe Mn clusters to prepare catalysts for CO hydrogenation was mentioned in the introduction [10,11]. Note also the previous work ofAnderson and Mainwar- ing [50], in which a difference in catalytic properties in hydrocarbon reac- tions on bimetallic particles prepared by the decomposition of Co2Rh2(CO)i2 and on conventionally prepared samples has been found. Probably some heteronuclear active centers are formed when Co2(CO)g adsorbed on silica containing the surface groups ^Zr H and ^Ti H was decomposed at 200 C [51]. The resulting catalysts contained centers for the hydrogenation of CO to give lower alcohols (Table 3). The expectancy of unusual catalytic effects may justify further attempts to prepare heteronuclear active centers via anchoring of metal carbonyls. 46 TABLE 3 Hydrogenation of carbon monoxide on catalysts prepared by supporting metal carbonyls on silica* containing anchored titanium and zirconium hydrides [51 ] Metal carbonyl Co content Ti or Zr Activity1' Content of alcohols in (wt.%) content reaction product (wt.%) (wt.%) CHsOH CzHsOH Co2(CO)g 2.3 1.8 (Ti) 3 6 30 Co2(CO)g 1.0 1.6 (Zr) 3 25 26 HFeC03(CO)i2 1.6 1.1 2 10 30 Co2(CO)g 4 6 5 \"SiOz with a BET surface area of 200 m2 g~1 was used- ''Activity in mol CO/g-atom Co s X 104 was measured after 10 h from the beginning of catalyst testing at 1 atm and 180 C with H2:CO = 2. Supported sulphided catalysts prepared with organometallic precursors The study of sulphided catalysts used for hydrotreatment of oil products belongs to one of the traditional fields of catalysis research, and many exper- imental results are accumulated. In the past decade, the interest in elucida- tion of the mechanism of the action of sulphide catalysts has increased due to the increasing role of these catalysts. Numerous data on the composition of these catalysts both in oxide and sulphide forms have been obtained by means of various physical-chemical methods [52]. However, the data ob- tained and the conclusions derived from them are quite contradictory. Several hypotheses have been advanced for the explanation of the mech- anism of the synergetic effect of an increase in activity when bimetallic sulphided catalysts (i.e., those containing a combination of two metals, usually Co Mo or Ni W) are used for hydrogenolysis of C S bonds (a complete survey of these hypotheses may be found in ref. [53]). One of the main reasons for the contradictions in this field is the inhomogeneity of the species on the surfaces of catalysts prepared by con- ventional methods (precipitation or impregnation). To obtain more homo- geneous sulphide catalysts, decomposition in Hy3 of silica-anchored complexes prepared from organometallic precursors was proposed [54]. By this tech- nique, both monometallic catalysts [54] (i.e., those containing compounds of one metal: Ni, Mo or W) and bimetallic catalysts [55] (i.e., those contain- ing combinations of two different metals) were prepared. Most dispersed catalysts containing tungsten (or molybdenum) sulphides on the surface of SiO; were obtained by the following scheme: ^~ \\ /^ ^ 'M' J-0/ ^R A -0\\ H^S .M -Q/ A MS^ (9) ( ^ is the SiOi surface; M = Mo or W; R = C3Hs or 04117). 46 Fig. 2.

The conventional impregnation technique of catalyst preparation results in the formation of polydispersed sulphide particles on SiO; (in the case of WS; the size ranges from 10 to 2000 A). In thiophene hydrogenolysis, the catalytic activity of monometallic samples of organometallic origin was found to be higher than that of con- ventional ones (Fig. 3). This result is explained by a higher dispersion of these catalysts, although for tungsten species a several-fold increase in the catalytic activity (atomic turnover number) may also be expected [54a]. The advantage of organometallic samples becomes greater at lower temper- atures of thiophene hydrogenolysis. In ultradispersed (<10 A) sulphide particles of organometallic origin, practically all the metal ions participate in catalysis, so that activity referred to 1 g-atom of metal may be considered as turnover number activity and be used for comparison of catalytic proper- ties of sulphides of different natures. At 350 C, the most active catalysts in thiophene hydrogenolysis are supported molybdenum sulphide particles. However, the difference in activity of sulphides of Mo and W from that of supported nickel sulphide is not so great as to allow one to consider one sulphide to be a promoter for another in the mixed catalysts. The widely used concept of synergy better reflects the matter when properties of bimetallic sulphided HDS catalysts are considered. Bimetallic supported sulphide catalysts derived from organometallic precursors were prepared by successive anchoring, first of Mo (or W) and then of Ni compounds, or vice versa [55]. In both cases, the synthesis of catalysts took place in four stages: (1) formation of anchored organo- metallic complexes; (2) their treatment in H;, 0; or H^S; (3) support of the second component in the form of an organometallic compound; and (4) treatment of samples by hydrogen sulphide at 400 C.

In this case the adsorption rate of the organometallic compound on the support contain- ing sulphides was observed to be considerably higher than that on the initial SiO;. This result may suggest a direct interaction of an organometallic com- pound with the supported sulphide. Regardless of the preparation method, the maximum synergetic effect was observed in the range of atomic ratio A = Ni/[Ni + Mo (or W)] S 0.3. In this range 'bimetallic' catalysts may be 10 (for Mo-containing samples) to 70 (for W-containing samples) times more active than monometallic catalysts (Fig. 4A). The dependence of nickel-related activity on the catalyst composi- tion is significant (Fig. 4B). The activity reaches its maximum upon decreas- ing X to 0.2, but decreases with an increase of the nickel content. Due to the high dispersion of the catalysts, at low concentrations of Ni all the nickel atoms may be assumed to enter into the composition of the active centers. Bimetallic catalysts of organometallic origin on SiOi were more active than traditional catalysts on SiO; or7-Al203 prepared by impregnation (Fig. 5). The following data were obtained when systems containing mixed sul- phides derived from organometallic precursors were studied by various methods: (a) Electron microscopy shows that particles formed in such catalysts have the form of filaments (or layers) about 25 A in length (Fig. 2c). For the most active catalysts, one-layer structures are prevalent. When the structures formed on the surface are composed of several layers, the distance between layers (~ 6 A) complies with that between the layers of the 002 plane in bulk sulphides of tungsten (or molybdenum). (b) XPS data point to the formation of mixed sulphide compounds of nickel with tungsten (or molybdenum) in 'bimetallic' catalysts. Upon forma- tion of mixed samples, a simultaneous change of electron levels on Ni and W (or Mo) was detected.

This may indicate that a partial transfer of electron density from nickel ions onto tungsten (or molybdenum) ions occurs. (c) Data characterizing radial electron distribution and EXAFS analysis show that in dispersed sulphide particles the main distances M M and M S, (characteristic of the lamellar WS; (or MoS;)) remain the distances are W W, 3.25 A; W-S, 2.46 A; Mo-Mo, 3.16 A; Mo-S, 2.41 A). However, structural elements not characteristic of bulk sulphides are also detected by these tech- niques. Thus, according to EXAFS, in the first coordination sphere of W (or Mo), oxygen ions are located at a distance of about 2 A. In the first coordi- nation sphere of nickel, sulphur ions are at the Ni S distance = 2.2 A (which is less than the Ni S distance in bulk sulphides of nickel). Nickel may be found in two positions with respect to tungsten, the W Ni distances being 2.38 and 3.42 A. On the basis of the data obtained from the study of sulphide catalysts of organometallic origin, a model of the active component has been sug- gested [55] (Figs. 7, 8). It has the following specific features: (a) The model presupposes the retention of elements of the lamellar structure of tungsten (or molybdenum) disulphide. A single sheet composed of two layers of sulphur with one layer of W (Mo) ions between them is quite sufficient to form active centers for thiophene hydrogenation. In sup- ported catalysts the sheet is either parallel to the support surface (adjoining the surface with a basal plane), or perpendicular to it (adjoining the surface with a side face); these cases are shown in Fig. 8. (b) A fraction of the tungsten (or molybdenum) atoms in the sheet are bonded with oxygen ions of the support surface. The chemical bond of tungsten (or molybdenum) with the surface of SiO, is already formed at the step of anchoring of the organometallic complexes. Some of these bonds may 60 Fig. 7. Models of active sulphide monolayer structures in sulphided catalysts supported on silica [55a]. Atoms in cross section Fig. 8.

Note that the distance between oxygen ions (~3.15 A) of the neighbouring tetrahedra of Si04 composing the SiO^ structure are close to the S S distances in the structure of the WS^ (or MoSi) sheet. The chemical bond with the surface provides stability to the dispersed state of the surface sulphides. (3) Nickel atoms are located on the 110 side faces of WS; sheets. The location of nickel in the center of a rectangle of sulphur atoms is indicated by EXAFS data. A driving force for the formation of such structures appears to be the fact that nickel located on the side face completes the structure of sheets of WSa and decreases the coordinative unsaturation of W (or Mo) ions adjoining the side face. 51 In the structure given in Fig. 8, tungsten atoms on the side face of the WS; sheet in combination with neighbouring nickel ions act as active centers for thiophene hydrogenolysis. Temperature-programmed reduction shows that in a hydrogen atmosphere, a fraction of the sulphur is removed from the catalyst. Sulphur atoms of the adsorbed thiophene occupy the position of the atoms removed (Fig. 8B). In this case the structure formed is favourable for the interaction of the C H fragment of the thiophene molecule with the coordinatively unsaturated nickel ions, being located at a distance of ~ 3.4 A from tungsten ions. Thus, synergy or promotion (i.e., an increase of the mutual catalytic action of nickel and tungsten sulphides) is due to the simul- taneous bonding of sulphur atoms in a sulphur-containing molecule with two metal ions (i.e.. Ni and W or Co and Mo); this weakens the C S bond. The breaking of this bond is favoured because one more nickel ion is located at the distance which permits its interaction with the a-carbon atom of the thiophene molecule. In their recent work, Tops0e et al. [53, 56] concluded that a 'mixed Co Mo S phase' (i.e., a surface compound between cobalt and molyb- denum sulphides) was responsible for the synergetic catalysis. Data obtained from the study of sulphide catalysts on SiO^ prepared from organometallic precursors [55] provide evidence that the active component of thiophene hydrogenolysis catalysts is a mixed sulphide structure. The above model of the active component has some common features with that considered in ref. [57] (the so-called incorporation model). Thus, anchored organometallic precursors used for preparation of sulphide catalysts permitted the attainment of more homogeneous surface compositions, and their study by means of various physical methods aids our understanding of the important fundamental problem the mechanism of the action of mixed sulphide catalysts. Conclusions More than ten years of research activity has resulted in delineation of the possibilities of the approach to catalyst preparation by supporting organometallic compounds on the hydroxylated surfaces of oxide carriers. On the basis of this approach, various species on oxide supports may be prepared: (1) Mononuclear transition metal complexes anchored via covalent bonding with surface oxygen. The organometallic approach of their prepara- tion permits development of methods of controlling the ligand environment of the transition metal ion and its oxidation state. Complexes containing organic and hydride ligands may be prepared which are not attainable by application of conventional catalyst preparation techniques. Further detailed study of surface organometallic chemistry using supported organometallic complexes is of interest for elucidating the mechanisms of hydrocarbon reac- tions. It is also of interest to expand this area of research to the study of 52 Fig. 9. Comparison of activities and stabilities of (Pt SnVAlaOa catalysts prepared by dif- ferent techniques [58].

(2) Binuclear complexes, or surface sites with paired locations of two ions. In this area only preliminary results have been obtained. But just at the step from mononuclear to binuclear active centers, one may expect the most striking catalytic effects for 'structure-sensitive' reactions. Very attractive may be attempts to prepare and study catalytic properties of active sites with paired locations of different transition metal atoms. (3) Polynuclear centers having definite numbers of metal atoms (an- chored clusters). However, available results seem to indicate that supported clusters may retain their nuclearity only under rather mild conditions, when they perform such facile reactions as olefin hydrogenation. It appears that to prove the possibility of retaining the initial cluster frameworks under more severe conditions, it is still necessary to collect more decisive data. More intensive study of the catalytic properties of heteronuclear clusters seems to be desirable. (4) Ultradispersed supported particles. For most Group VIII elements, the possibility of obtaining ultradispersed metal particles from organo- metallic precursors has been shown. In some cases a deviation of the cata- lytic properties of such particles from those prepared conventionally has been observed. An interesting trend in this area may be the development of methods of preparation of bimetallic catalysts using heteronuclear organo- metallic complexes. Examples of this use are not numerous, but some results show that the direct interaction of two metals in the initial compound may provide good catalytic properties. One example is shown in Fig. 9, whereby platinum-tin catalysts for aromatization were prepared via the anchoring of Sn Pt complexes to alumina, which provided more stable and active sam- ples. The possibility of dispersed sulphided particles was also shown. 63 As a whole, in spite of the relative maturity achieved in the area of catalyst preparation by supporting organometallic compounds, it still retains its appeal (although some of its devotees certainly lost their initial overly optimistic expectations). We hope that further research in this field will be helpful in elucidating the surface organometallic chemistry related to the mechanisms of interesting practical reactions; in understanding the forma- tion of the active surface species; and in establishing relationships of cata- lytic properties to the structure and composition of active centers.

Yermakov Institute of Catalysis, Novosibirsk 630090 U.S.S.R. The state of the field of preparation of supported catalysts from organometallic precursors is reviewed. Methods of catalyst preparation based on the interaction of organometallic compounds with the surfaces of oxide supports may be used (a) to prepare catalytic sites with specific properties which cannot be obtained by conventional techniques and (b) to obtain samples with more homogeneous and more easily characterized surface compositions, with the view of using them to study the problems of fundamental catalysis. Examples are given of recent results of the application of organometallic compounds to prepare heterogeneous catalysts for olefin polymerization and to obtain supported metal and sulphide catalysts.
