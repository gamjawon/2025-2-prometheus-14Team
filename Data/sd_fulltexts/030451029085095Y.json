LAU* Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, Hong Kong Polytechnic, Hung Horn, Kowloon (Hong Kong) (Received March 20, 1989; revised November 28, 1989) Dimerization of methyl acrylate The dimerization of methyl acrylate (MA) generally gives rise to a mix- ture of dimethyl hex-2-enedioates (la, b), dimethyl hex-3-enedioates (2a, b), dimethyl 2-methylpentendioates (3) and dimethyl 2-methyleneglutarate (4) (Fig. 1). The tail-to-tail dimers (la, b; 2a, b) are of industrial interest as they provide an alternate route to the manufacture of adipic derivatives. '3 H3COaC 1a(cis5 Ib(trans) 2a(cis) 2b(trans) \"COsCH3 HsCOa' Selective dimerization of methyl acrylate was first achieved in 1965 utilizing ruthenium chloride and rhodium chloride as the catalysts at elevated temperature [1]. Shortly thereafter, Barlow and coworkers [2] demonstrated that palladium dichloride also effected acrylate dimerization but that conversions were limited by the eventual reduction of the catalyst to palladium metal. The catalyst lifetime may be prolonged by adding oxidants which regenerate the active Pd(II) [3]. However, this is impractical for any large scale utility. Continuous studies by McKinney and Cotton have shown that zero-valent ruthenium complexes can catalyze the acrylate dimerization reactions under milder conditions [4]. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-6102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands L2 It is known that Ru 3(00) 13 or its derivatives are active catalysts or catalyst precursors for a wide range of reactions such as the water-gas shift reaction [5]; production of alkyi formates from CO;, H; and alcohols [6]; methanation of CO; [7]; oxidation of alcohols to esters [8]; olefin hydro- genation [9]; transfer hydrogenation of CCl4 by alcoholic solvents [10] and reductive carbonylation of nitrobenzene [11]. In view of the versatility of Ru3(CO)(2 and its derivatives in catalytic reactions and the fact that zero- valent ruthenium complexes are capable of catalyzing the dimerization of aery late, we therefore began our studies of catalytic dimerization of methyl acrylate based on Ru3(CO)i2, which is readily available and may serve as the source of zero-valent ruthenium species. In a typical run, 0.05 g of Ru3(CO)i2, the appropriate amount of phos- phine, 0.008 g of hydroquinone (polymerization inhibitor) and 10 ml of MA were heated in a sealed thick-walled tube at 130 C for 20 h. The dimer mix- ture was distilled under reduced pressure and analyzed by gas chromato- graphy. All linear dimers were identified by comparing with authentic sam- ples. Some higher oligomers were also formed and were not analyzed. The results are summarized in Tables 1 - 4. It can be seen from Tables 1-4 that in nearly all runs (except run 3 in Table 1), frans-dimethyl hex-2-enedioate (trans-A.2) was the dominant product among the linear dimers.

But high L/B ratios were produced in the Ru3(CO)i2/P(OPh)3 systems, especially when two molar equivalents of triphenyl phosphite was added (run 2 in Table 4). In this reaction, a fairly good overall dimer yield of 55% was obtained and the very high L/B ratio of 27 made this system the most selective among all runs. Although more thorough investigation will be required in order to clarify the dependence of selectivity of the catalytic sys- tems on the electronic properties of the phosphines and phosphites, our present results give some indications that the less basic triphenylphosphine* yielded the largest L/B ratios among the three phosphines studied; and the even less basic triphenylphosphite gave very high L/B ratios. In each of the catalytic dimerizations that we studied, gas evolution was observed at the early stages of the reaction. A gas sample was collected in one of the reactions and was confirmed by MS to be hydrogen gas. The evolution of hydrogen gas might indicate the MA was first oxidatively added to the ruthenium to produce the ruthenium hydride species. Heinekey and Muetterties had shown by metal isotope labeling studies that cluster frag- mentation in Ru3(CO)i2 is a facile process as ~70 C [13]. Therefore it is reasonable to regard Ru3(CO)i2 as the catalyst precursor since it is difficult to imagine that the cluster would have stayed intact during catalytic reac- tions at 130 C. The Ru3(CO)i2-based catalytic systems are promising. Yields of dimers are high compared to the palladium systems [2,14]. Turnover numbers (mol of linear dimers produced/mol of Ru) of our systems are comparable to those of other ruthenium systems [4]. In addition to the good yields of dimers, most of the reactions studied produced trans-A2 as the major *Basicities of the phosphines are as follows: PPh3: pK^ = 2.73; PBu3\": pK^= 8.43; PEt3:pKa=8.69 [12]. L5 product. The system of Ru3(CO)i2 + 2P(OPh)3 (reaction 2, Table 4) is espe- cially good because it gives not only a high yield of (rans-A2, but also a very large L/B ratio of 27. The trans-A.^ isomer can be easily separated from the dimer mixture as a 1:1 adduct with LiBF4 [16]. Hydrolysis of the adduct will reproduce the trans-A2 isomer. The high selectivity of frans-A2 is reward- ing since tandem conjugate addition/cyclization of this compound with dialkyi cuprates will readily produce 3-substituted-2-carbomethoxy cyclo- pentones (I) (eqn. (1)) [15]. Subsequent alkylation and decarboxylation will afford the corresponding 2,3-disubstituted cyclopentanones, which include many biologically active compounds, including the 11-deoxyprostaglandins [16] and cyclopentanoid antibiotic antitumor agents such as sarkomycin [17]. (1) Cyclotrimerization of methyl propiolate The cyclo-oligomerization reaction of acetylene with substituted alkynes is probably one of the best studied reactions of organometallic chemistry. Early work in this field is connected with the name Reppe [18]. These reactions provide routes for the syntheses of substituted cycio octa- tetraenes and benzenes which are sometimes difficult to prepare by other methods. Mueller et al. have made extensive contributions to the cycloco- oligomerization reactions of dialkynes and monoalkynes [19]. The impor- tance of the cyclo-oligomerization reaction has been demonstrated by Funk and Vollhardt, who utilized this reaction in an elegant fashion to synthesize racemic estrone [20]. Although structures of alkyne derivatives of Ru^(CO)i^ have been well characterized [21], application of Ru3(CO)i2 to the catalytic cyclo-oligo- merization or cycloco-oligomerization of alkynes has not been studied. We first attempted the cyclo-oligomerization of phenylacetylene with Ru3(CO)i2, but were not able to produce the cyclotrimers or cyclotetramers; some unidentified higher oligomers were formed. We then studied the cyclo- oligomerization of an electron-deficient alkyne, the methyl propiolate, CH^C COyMe. It was found that Ru 3(00) 12, with or without added phos- phine or phosphite, has been able to catalyze the cyclotrimerization of methyl propiolate to give a mixture of 1,2,4- and 1,3,5-tricarbmethoxyben- zenes(5) and (6) (eqn. (2)). Results of the cyclotrimerization reactions are shown in Table 5. When the reaction was performed at 70 C, only 28% yield of cyclotrimers were obtained, while elevating the temperature to 130 C nearly doubled the L6 TABLE 5 Catalytic eyclotrimerization of methyl propiolate\" Run Catalytic Temp.

Addition of 1 - 3 molar equivalents of PPh3 caused no obvious changes, either in the % yield of cyclotrimers or in the isomer ratios. But when PBU3 , PPhClz or P(OPh)3 was used as additive, the overall yield of cyclotrimers and the isomer ratios both decreased. Our preliminary results seem to indicate no trend for the yield and selectivity of cyclotrimers as functions of the basicities and steric effects of the additives. Cycloco-oligomerization reactions of alkynes with CO; and nitriles to produce substituted 2-pyrones and substituted pyridines (eqns. (3), (4), res- pectively) are of some interest [22]. Production of substituted 2-pyrones have been effected by zero-valent nickel complexes [23], while Wakatsuki and Yamazaki have demonstrated that cyclopentadienylcobalt species are very effective in catalyzing cyclocotrimerization of alkynes with nitriles to give substituted pyridines [24]. We studied the cyclocotrimeriza- 0 2 HC=C-C-OCH3 + Cog > R 0 2 HCsC-fi-OCHg + CH3CN L7 (3) (4) tion of methyl propiolate with CO-^ and acetonitrile, in hopes of obtaining the substituted 2-pyrones and substituted pyridines respectively. But in neither case was the cotrimer formed. Only the benzene derivative formed, but the % yield dropped to 38% in the presence of CO^ and to 16% when acetonitrile was added. Our preliminary studies of cyclodimerization reactions of methyl pro- piolate show that Ru3(CO)i2 alone can act as an active catalyst precursor; investigations of cyclo-oligomerization of other substituted alkynes and cycloco-oligomerization reactions of alkynes with heterocumulenes such as carbodiimides and isocyanates are now in progress.
