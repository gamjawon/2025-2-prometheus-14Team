(Received September 28, 1984; accepted November 16, 1984) Summary The structure of polymeric complexes of rhodium(III), synthesized from ethanolic solutions of RhCl3 and various polyamines and recently found to be rather efficient catalysts for dihydrogen evolution from water after some activation, is discussed. The coordination sphere of rhodium ions in such complexes is shown to contain two or four nitrogen donor atoms, depending on the structure of polymeric ligands and on the rhodium con- tent in the polymer. Introduction Conversion of solar energy into the chemical energy of dihydrogen and dioxygen via photocatalytic processes of water cleavage is often discussed as one of the promising sources of the fuel for the next century. One of the most important proglems associated with the photocatalytic cleavage of water seems to be the development of efficient and suitable catalysts for dihydrogen evolution from water in the presence of one-electron reductants [1]. Recently we have found [2] that polymer-stabilized finely dispersed rhodium metal can provide rather effective catalysts in producing di- hydrogen through the reaction: 2A- + 2H+ (or 2H2O) > 2A(+20H-) + H; t , (where A\" = Vaq2'*\", Craq2\"*\" or a reduced form of methylvio logen). The cata- lysts are produced via activation by strong water-soluble reductants of rhodium(III) complexes with polymers containing amine groups such as polyethylenimine (PEI) and lonite AN-221. Such catalysts were found to be active even in multicomponent micro- heterogeneous photocatalytic systems containing lipid vesicles [3,4]. The * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 160 activity of the rhodium catalysts formed was proved to be largely dependent on the structure and composition of the initial polymeric rhodium com- plexes, the most coordinatively unsaturated (with respect to N-atoms) complexes being the most active. Thus it is of great value to investigate con- ditions for the preparation of such complexes. This paper is devoted to this matter and to the elucidation of the structure of non-activated rhodium(III) complexes with branched poly- ethylenimine, lonite AN-221 and their low molecular weight analog ethyl- enediamine by optical UV-VIS spectroscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectros- copy (XPS) and ESR methods. The data on the catalytic activity of these complexes is presented in Part II (see following paper). Experimental The complex [Rh(en)2Cl2]C104 was synthesized as described in [5], its elemental composition corresponding to that calculated. The [Rh-en] com- plex was prepared by mixing ethanol solutions of RhC^-SHiO and en at a molar ratio Rh:en =1:1. A red precipitate formed which was then filtered thoroughly from RhCl3 by washing with ethanol and acetone, and air-dried. The complex produced was slightly soluble in water and insoluble in alcohol and acetone. Its composition was 27.5% Rh, 8.41% N, 7.60% C, 3.53% H and 28.5% Cl, if calculated using atomic ratio Rh^ 302.41113.2013; thus this complex appears to be a mixture of several compounds. Rh PEl complexes PEI (33% branching, molecular weight 30000) was prepared at the Chair of Macromolecular Compounds of the Chemistry Department, Moscow State University. Rh PEI complexes with varying Rh:N ratios were prepared by mixing ethanol solutions of RhCl3'3H20 and of PEI at a constant rhodi- um concentration (3 X 10~2 M) and varying concentrations of a polymer. After 6 h incubation at 298 K with a continuous stirring, the precipitate formed was separated, thoroughly washed from RhCl3 with distilled water and ethanol, finally washed with acetone and air-dried. Rh-AN-221 complexes lonite AN-221 is a commercially produced granular ion-exchange resine, which represents p-chloromethylated polystyrene crosslinked with 8% divinylbenzene and aminated by ethylenediamine. Its structure is as follows : CH-^ J CSy01/ , r2 ^ 'ca, 2/ CH -<\">- CHg-ITH-OHg-CHg-BHg / (T2 T2\\ \\ CH -^^-CHg-llH-CHg-CHg-lTH-CHg - C/- CH I 151 where m + n > l. To remove iron cations which are usually present in the commercial polymer, it was thoroughly washed with l N HCl, then con- verted into a deprotonated form by neutralization with NaOH and washed with doubly distilled water to attain neutral pH. Rh AN-221 complexes with various Rh:N ratios were prepared by adding the polymer granules to ethanol solutions of RhCl3 of varying con- centrations with continuous stirring for 24-36 h. The granules were then washed several times with water and alcohol, each time for 2 - 3 h, then finally washed with acetone and air-dried. C, H and N analyses were per- formed using a CHN-Analyzer (Prague); the content of rhodium was de- termined gravimetrically. The absorption spectra of solutions in the UV-VIS region were regis- tered by a Specord UV-VIS spectrophotometer. The diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded using a single-beam VSU-2P spectrophotometer with a special attachment unit. XPS spectra were recorded on a VG Scientific ESCA-3 spectrometer at a pressure of ~10-8 -10~9 torr. MgKa radiation (E^v = 1253.6 eV) was used for excitation of photoelectrons. The samples were fixed by pressing into a nickel mesh welded in front of the sample holder. X-ray photoelectron spectra were calibrated using external and internal standards. In the external standard method, gold was evaporated onto the sample surface, and the value of BE Au ^iq/z for the gold film obtained was taken to equal 83.8 eV [6]. In another case, finely dispersed carbon black was added to the sample and the value of BE C Is for carbon black was taken to equal 284.2 eV [6]. In the internal standard method, the value of BE for Cl 2p3/2 was taken to equal 198.7 eV [6]. The theoretical values of the photoionization cross- sections reported in [7] were used to determine the atomic ratios of elements from XPS data. The ESR spectra were recorded by the X-range Bruker ER-200 D and EPR-V (Institute of Chemical Physics, Moscow) ESR-spectrometers. Results and discussion Rhodium complexes with ethylenediamine and polyamines differ in color depending on the Rh:N ratio in the complex. Red complexes are formed at high Rh:N ratios and yellow ones at low Rh:N ratios. Figure 1 illustrates the absorption spectra of [Rh(en)2Cl2]\"1\" and [Rh en] complexes in solution, and also the diffuse reflectance spectra of Rh PEl and Rh AN-221 complexes with varying Rh:N ratios. The spec- trum of [Rl^e^aCI^ corresponds to that reported [5] and represents a superposition of the spectra of cis- and frans-isomers with the maxima at v = 28.6 and 34.2 kK and at 24.6 and 34.6 kK, respectively. Compared to the spectrum of [Rl^en^Clz]\"^, that of [Rh en] is shifted to the longwave region, thus its red color. The diffuse reflectance spectra of polymeric complexes (especially those of Rh AN-221) have a rather vague structure. However, it is seen that 152 the positions of individual components of these spectra agrees well with those of the spectral components of monomeric complexes. For example, the diffuse reflectance spectra of yellow Rh PEl complexes have lines typical for [Rl'^en^Cl;]\"1'. In the spectrum of the red Rh PEl complex, in addition to the lines which can be attributed to the absorption of yellow Rh PEl complex, there also appears a line with v ~ 21 kK typical for [Rh en]. In the diffuse reflectance spectrum of the yellow Rh AN-221 complex, in addition to the absorption bands of 'yellow' complexes, a shoulder appears in the absorption region of 'red' complexes (y = 21 kK). Apparently in the case of AN-221, formation of the individual yellow com- plexes is hindered by a rather rigid three-dimensional structure of the macro- ligands. The XPS provides additional information on the structure of rhodium complexes with polymeric ligands. Unfortunately, no such data for rhodium ethylenediamine complexes were available in the literature. A comparison of the experimental values of BE (binding energy) for Rh 3d5/; and N Is levels (310.4 eV and 400.5 eV, respectively) for the bis( ethylenediamine) complex of rhodium (Fig. 2) with the published data for the tetra-ethyl- amine complex of Rh(III) (310.4 eV and 400.4 eV, respectively) [6] suggests the similarity of electronic properties of rhodium and nitrogen in these systems. It should be noted that the binding energy of about 400.5 eV for the N Is level observed for [Rh(en)2Cl2]'1' is typical for amine complexes 398 399 W m m m 308 309 310 31I 312 313 Binding Energy (eV) Fig. 1.

The increase of the BE N Is to 402.1 eV in [Rh en] containing one molecule of en gives evidence for a decrease in the electron density of the nitrogen atom. Such an increase in the binding energy when passing from the complex containing two molecules of en to the com- plex containing one molecule of en has also been reported elsewhere for the complexes of Cu24' with en. In this latter case, the BE N Is in the [Cu^ en] complex is 1.1 e V larger than that for [(^''\" (en)^] complex [8]. Unfortu- nately we are unaware of literature data on the complexes of noble metals containing one molecule of en in the coordination sphere. For the [Rh en] complex in the region of N Is, we have observed, along with an intense line with BE 402.1 eV, a shoulder in the region of about 400.5 eV which may be ascribed to the presence of some [RI^en^C^]4\" complexes in the [Rh en] sample. The N Is line in AN-221 (Fig. 2) corresponds to amine nitrogen. The considerable width of this line (2.8 eV, i.e. ~1 eV more than in individual compounds) probably indicates a multiform electronic state of nitrogen in Anionite, which can result either from the presence of both primary and secondary nitrogen atoms in the polymer, or from their different degrees of solvation by water molecules present in the sample. Supporting RhCIs on Anionite leads to a shift of the N Is line toward higher binding energies by about 0.8 e V and to a change in the line shape (a shoulder appears in the region of 402.0 eV). An increase in the binding energy of N Is may be evidence for a decrease in the electron density on nitrogen atoms which corresponds to the formation of the coordination bond between rhodium and donor atoms of lonite nitrogen. As seen in Fig. 2, of the two nitrogen states in the rhodium complex with AN-221, one state corresponds to the [Rh(en)2Cl2]+ complex (400.6 eV), the other to the [Rh 'en] complex (402.0 eV). Note also that the observed BE of Rh 3ds/2 in Rh AN-221 indicates that the majority of the rhodium in the complex has an oxidation state of +3. The data obtained for Rh PEl, in general, accord well with those for Rh AN-221 (Fig. 2). The oxidation state of rhodium in Rh PEl is +3, and the BE N Is is 400.6 eV for yellow complexes. For red complexes the corre- sponding BE is shifted somewhat toward higher energies and attains 401.0 eV. No distinct shoulder is observed in the region of 402 eV, although the shape of the N Is line for Rh PEIred in this region points to the presence of notable amounts of the complex, with a maximum at ~402 eV. It should be noted that a decrease in the coordination saturation of rhodium with respect to N-atoms leads to a decrease in BE Rh 3ds/2 for both the monomeric and polyethyleneimine complexes. Since according to XPS experiments the oxidation state of the majority of rhodium in the complexes under study equals +3 and the electronic struc- ture of atomic rhodium is 4d8s, one could anticipate that polymeric rhodium complexes must be ESR-inactive. However, the rhodium complexes under study exhibit sufficiently intense anisotropic ESR spectra with rather narrow 154 Fig. 3. ESR spectra of Rh AN-221 with varying Rh:N ratios, at 77 K: (l) 1:2.4; (2) 1:2.7; (3) 1:3.1; (4) 1:7.2. lines (Fig. 3). Such ESR signals were registered for both polymeric and monomeric complexes, red and yellow, but only provided these are synthe- sized in alcoholic solution; e.g. [Rh(en)2Cl2]C104 synthesized in aqueous solution was completely ESR-inactive. Double integration of ESR spectra of the complexes and their comparison with that of the reference CuS04- SH^O monocrystal have proved that only 1 - 3% of rhodium ions in the samples are paramagnetic, which is in good agreement with the relevant data in [9]. It should be noted also that the parameters of the ESR spectra (Table 1) are not typical for transition metal complexes. Rather, they are typical for inorganic radicals [10]. We have found that a prolonged evacua- tion leads to the disappearance of the ESR signals, the initial spectra being recovered on subsequent exposure of the samples to air. For this reason one TABLE 1 ESR parameters\" for rhodium complexes at 77 K Complexes 8\\ 0.002 g^io.wn gPh.Wn gfio.wa g^io.om Rh--AN-221yeii<,w Rh AN-221red Rh PEIyeilow Rh-PEIred [Rhtenh]13 [Rh-en]11 2.102 2.096 2.104 2.092 2.096 2.088 2.010 2.012 2.011 2.008 2.011 2.012 2.109 2.107 2.103 2.032 2.033 2.031 1.965 1.966 1.966 0.002. b Data from [7]. 165 can assume that the ESR spectra observed must be attributed to a radical form of oxygen bound with the synthesized complexes. In fact, it is known [11 -13] that some complexes of rhodium(II) and cobalt(II) are capable of producing in air ESR-active Superoxide compounds of formulae Rh3'1^\" and Co^Oi\", respectively, with ESR spectra typical for the 0^~ radical anion. Taking into account both the published data and our observations, one may conclude that, during the course of synthesis of complexes in alcoholic media, some of the Rh(III) is reduced to give either Rh(III) hydride or Rh(II) species, which can further interact with oxygen of air to produce Superoxide complexes whose ESR spectra are observed experimentally (see also [9]). The ESR parameters of 0^~ depend dramatically on the structure of the center which coordinates the radical. The ESR spectrum of the yellow complex seems to belong to an individual compound, whereas that of the red complex represents a clear superposition of ESR spectra of yellow and red complexes (Fig. 3). Indeed, the ESR spectra of the yellow complexes represent mainly anisotropic signals with axial symmetry of the g-tensor; only traces of a signal with totally anisotropic g-tensor are observed in these spectra. For the ESR spec- trum of the red complex, the dominating signals have totally anisotropic g-tensors. However, the ESR method provides only indirect information about the structure of the majority of the polymeric complexes, because less than 5% of the rhodium complexes are paramagnetic, and thus ESR data can be useful only when compared with data obtained by other physical methods. Nevertheless, a comparison of the relative intensities of ESR lines corre- sponding to g^ and g^ (Fig. 3) with the relative amplitude of the XPS lines attributed to Rh AN-221 samples containing varying concentrations of yellow and red complexes reveals a good correlation between them. This permits the assumption that the ratio of intensities of ESR signals with axial symmetry and that of asymmetric ESR signals reflects rather correctly the original ratio between concentrations of yellow and red complexes of rhodi- um(III) in the sample, as determined by XPS. Thus, rhodium Superoxide complexes appear to serve as specific paramagnetic probes in the study of rhodium-polymeric catalysts. The low observed concentration of these adducts compared to the total content of rhodium in the sample seems to be associated with the thermodynamics of their formation. Thus, when supporting RhCIa from alcoholic solutions on PEI or AN- 221, coordination complexes of rhodium with nitrogen-donating atoms of polymers are produced. Comparing the data obtained by ESR, XPS and UV- VIS spectrophotometry for polymeric complexes and their low-molecular weight analogs, namely, rhodium complexes with ethylene diamine, one may conclude that two types of complexes, referred to as 'yellow' and 'red', are formed depending on the concentration of metal ions in the polymer phase. The sequence of the formation of 'red' and 'yellow' complexes with increasing Rh:N ratio indicates that 'yellow' complexes have a more 156 saturated coordination sphere. It seems rather probable that 'yellow' com- plexes have four nitrogen atoms in the coordination sphere, while 'red' complexes have only two atoms of nitrogen, and that the coordination sphere involves nitrogen atoms of both secondary and primary amino groups of the polymers, the remaining coordination sites being placed by Cl~ anions and/or solvent molecules. Such a supposition seems to be confirmed by the following facts. First, the data from all the physical methods used have shown the similarity between Rh(III) complexes with polymeric ligands (PEI, AN-221) and ethylenediamine. Since en is a bidentate ligand, the formation of com- plexes (!N:lRh) with this ligand or its polymeric analogs seems improbable under the experimental conditions employed when totally deprotonated ligands are used. Indeed, in this case the binding of one nitrogen atom with Rh3\"1\" is immediately followed by the binding of a 'neighbouring' nitrogen atom. In such a way, addition of the second en molecule must lead to the formation of a Rl^I^3\"*\" complex, and of the third molecule to the formation of a Rh(N)63\"1\" complex which is well known from the literature [11, 12]. As shown in [14] for macroligands, the complexes of composi- tion 1M:6N (where M is the metal ion and N is involved in the polymer com- position) are not formed because of steric hindrances. This means that the most probable composition of the two types of polymeric complexes in question is Rh(N)23\"1\" and Rh(N)43\"1\". (In fact, it seems rather probable that when using protonated polymeric ligands one can obtain complexes with an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the coordination sphere of the metal.) Some additional evidence for the 'yellow' complexes having a not- saturated coordination sphere follows from ESR measurements. Indeed, the anisotropy of the ESR spectra related to the 'yellow' complexes has an axial symmetry (see Fig. 3 and Table 1). At the same time, it is known that for [Rh(en)3]Cl3 complexes [11,12] the ESR spectra of their oxygenated forms reveal anisotropy corresponding to a completely asymmetric ^-factor. This proves that the 'yellow' complex is not coordinatively saturated with respect to nitrogen (i.e. this is not the Rh(N)63\"1\" complex). Axial symmetry of the oxygenated form, and thus the same symmetry of its g-tensoi, seems to be achieved for only the trans complex Rh^I^Oi\", in which all the nitrogen atoms are located in the equatorial plane*. The presence discussed above of traces of the totally anisotropic spec- trum in the spectra of 'yellow' complexes seems to be due to an equilibrium between 'symmetric' trans- and 'asymmetric' cis-configurations of the com- plexes. The 'red' complexes, which probably contain only two nitrogen atoms in the coordination sphere, also must have completely anisotropic ESR spectra, which is the case observed in our experiments. For Rh PEl 'yellow' complexes one may assume that the formation of the bond between rhodium and three successive nitrogen atoms belonging to one polymer chain *It is unclear, however, whether the structure of the initial rhodium complex before oxygenation is also planar. 157 is quite possible. However, such a coordination can be hindered to a large extent by steric factors. In the case of AN-221, the participation of two lateral polymer chains is necessary for formation of the Rh(N)4 complex. Under the conditions employed, individual 'red' complexes of formula [RI^N^C^l'nH^O are formed neither with polymeric ligands nor with en; all the prepared samples contained some portion of 'yellow' complexes. Evidently, it is for this reason that Rh(en)33\"1\" and Rh(en)23\"1\" complexes are well known in the ' literature in contrast to the [Rh en]3\"1\" complex. Steric hindrance in the polymer chain seems to facilitate the formation of struc- tures of the type Rh(N)23\"*', provided there is an excess of metal ions in the polymers. As follows from ESR data, in the case of identical starting condi- tions, the portion of the 'red' complex in the sample will be notably larger when rhodium complexes synthesized with PEI or AN-221 are washed only with alcohol than when these are washed with both alcohol and water. This means that Rh(N)23\"1\" complexes are rather unstable and thus can be easily washed out in aqueous solutions. It should also be noted that the composition of the complexes is deter- mined not only by the metal content in the polymer phase but also by the flexibility of the polymer matrix. For example, in the case of a crosslinked AN-221 lonite, a mixture of 'red' and 'yellow' complexes is usually formed. Formation of 'yellow' complexes alone occurs only in a very large excess of ligands, which is a consequence of the weak conformational mobility of the crosslinked polymer. PEI is more flexible than the crosslinked polymer, which under otherwise identical conditions favors formation of the coordina- tively more saturated 'yellow' complexes. One can also suppose that due to the very high local concentration of metal inside the polymeric globules, unsaturated complexes of rhodium, especially of the Rh(N)23\"1\" type, in fact form multinuclear associates (for example, with chloride anions of the JU-bridge type) which are well-known for rhodium compounds (see e.g. [15]) and which cannot be detected using the exploited physical methods. In this respect, it is of interest to mention that the 'red' complexes are those which are considerably more active when the using rhodium complexes discussed as catalysts for dihy drogen evolution from water [2].

Structure of rhodium(III)-polyamine complexes E.R. Savinova A.I. Kokorin A.P. Shepelin A.V. Pashis P.A. Zhdaan V.N. Parmon 1 Institute of Catalysis, Novosibirsk 630090 U.S.S.R. 1 Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. The structure of polymeric complexes of rhodium(III), synthesized from ethanolic solutions of RhCl3 and various polyamines and recently found to be rather efficient catalysts for dihydrogen evolution from water after some activation, is discussed. The coordination sphere of rhodium ions in such complexes is shown to contain two or four nitrogen donor atoms, depending on the structure of polymeric ligands and on the rhodium content in the polymer.
