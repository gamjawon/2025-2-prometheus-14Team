Introduction Owing to the wide availability of the starting materials, the reaction of aldehydes and ketones with activated aromatic compounds might constitute a useful synthetic strategy to prepare substituted gem-diarylalkanes. However, up to now only intra- molecular versions of this reaction, such as the Pechmann or the Schraup syntheses, have found general applicability [ 1-3 ]. This is mainly due to the fact that besides the expected diarylalkanes, conventional Lewis acids such as A1C13 usually * Corresponding author. E-mail itq@upvnet.upv.es, fax.

R~ bis-spiroketals employed as catalysts give rise to appreciable amounts of oligomers and polycyclic aromatic compounds as byproducts [4]. We have previously shown that acid faujasites can catalyze the hydroxyalkylation of benzene derivatives with aldehydes [5-7]. In the present paper we announce that acid zeolites of medium and large pore size are also highly selective catalysts for the analogous hydroxyalkylation of 2-alkylfurans 1. Blocking of the 2 position of the furan ring not only avoids cyclo- and oligomerization of it, but also in the case of the derivative la, the acetoxypropyl substituent is necessary for the subse- quent transformation into bis-spiroketals by oxidative cyclization [ 8 ] (Scheme 1 ). This type of spiroketals have been found to exhibit a potent antagonist effect for juvenile hormone of some flying insects [9-11]. It is well established that furan rings are highly reactive towards electrophilic aromatic substitution compared to the benzene series [ 12]. Large amounts of tarry oligomers and unidentified decomposition materials are generally produced during the reactions of furan heterocycles under strong Friedel-Crafts conditions. The acidity of zeolites can be tuned by controlling their physicochemical parameters [ 13] and, therefore, it is possible to obtain a catalyst to suit the acid requirements of a particular transformation. In addition, confinement of the acid sites within the internal surfaces of the solid may impose spatial restrictions to the occurrence of an extensive polymerization. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts HYD-1 (Si/AI 15), HYD-2 (Si/Al 21 ), HYD-3 (Si/A1 27.5), H-Mor (Si/AI 10) and H-ZSM-5 ( Si/A1 17 ) were commercial samples ( PQ Industries ). H/3 was prepared by template decomposition (550) of an as-synthesized tetraethylam- monium sample (Si/A1 13) according to the literature [ 14]. 2.2. Organic substrates 2-Methylfuran was supplied by Aldrich and used as received. 2-( 3-Acetoxypro- pyl)furan [15] (la) was obtained by condensation of furfural (Aldrich) with malonic acid in pyridine at reflux temperature, followed by esterification in dime- thylformamide of the resulting crotonic acid with dimethyl sulfate in the presence of lithium hydroxide monohydrate and hydrogenation at atmospheric pressure using F. AIgarra et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 119-126 121 Pd/C catalyst. Lithium aluminium hydride ( 1.5 equivalents) reduction of methyl ester in dry ethyl ether at O afforded 3- (2-furyl) - 1-propanol. Finally, acetylation at room temperature of the latter with acetic anhydride in pyridine (5 ml) and catalytic amounts of 4-(N,N-dimethylamino) pyridine gave rise quantitatively to the acetate la. 2.3. Reaction procedure Thermally activated zeolites (500, overnight) were added to a solution of 2- (3-acetoxypropyl)furan la ( 100 mg) or 2-methylfuran lb ( 100 rag) and nitro- benzene ( 60 mg, as internal standard) in acetone (50 ml). The resulting suspension was magnetically stirred at controlled temperature. In the case of the reaction with aldehydes, equimolar amounts were used and tetrachloromethane (50 ml) was the solvent. The course of the reaction was periodically followed by analyzing the organic phase using a gas chromatograph (GC, HP 5988) provided with a 25 m capillary column of 5% phenylmethylsilicone. At the end of the reaction, the catalyst was filtered, washed with fresh solvent and submitted to continuous solid-liquid extraction using dichloromethane as solvent. The combined organic solutions were weighed and analyzed by GC, GC-MS (HP 5988A spectrometer, same column and conditions as GC), ~H-NMR (Varian Unity + or Varian 369 EM, CDC13 as solvent, TMS as internal standard) and IR (Perkin-Elmer 781 spectrophotometer). Products 4c, 4d, and 4h were isolated by column chromatography using silica gel and dichloromethane as eluent. Elemental analysis of 4c was performed at the Instituto de Qufmica Bioorgfinica of CSIC at Barcelona. 2.4.

Results and discussion Reaction of furan la in acetone as solvent was carried out at different reaction temperatures in the presence of three dealuminated HYD-1, HYD-2, and HYD-3 zeolites, as well as H/3, H-MOR and H-ZSM-5. The substrate-to-catalyst ratio was increased one order of magnitude without appreciable decrease on the conversion of la. The results attained are contained in Table 1. In all cases the corresponding gem difuryl derivative 4c was the predominant reaction product, accompanied by lesser amounts of the alkene 2c and the hydroxy derivative 3c. Compound 4c was fully characterized by IR, MS, tH-NMR, and elemental analysis of pure samples after chromatographic isolation, while by-products 2c and 3c were assigned based on the MS of the reaction mixtures. As indicated in Scheme 2, these products can be easily rationalized assuming the general reaction mechanism accepted for this type of alkylations. From Table 1, it can be seen that conversions and selectivity to 4c steadily increase with the reaction temperature, and they are significantly higher for tridi- rectional Y and/3 than for monodirectional MOR or medium pore size ZSM-5. The latter observation probably reflects some restrictions to the diffusion of the products through the micropores of these two zeolites. Dealumination of Y zeolites produces an increase on the selectivity to the gem dialkylation. Hydroxyalkylation of the acetoxypropyl furan la was also carried out with acetaldehyde and aromatic aldehydes (Table 2).

Compound 4d arising from the condensation of la with acetaldehyde was fully characterized by IR, MS and IH- NMR of isolated samples. Attempts to obtain reaction products using an aqueous solution of formaldehyde or its trimeric or polymeric form in organic solvents were unsuccessful. This rather unexpected finding contrasts with the reactivity order observed in the benzene series in the presence of similar catalysts and conditions, where formaldehyde was found to be more reactive than the other carbonyl com- pounds [ 7 ]. Higher selectivities to gem dialkylation were found for acetaldehyde than for benzaldehydes. A representative time-conversion plot for the reaction of la is presented in Fig. 1. As observed before for the case of acetone, ZSM-5 exhibited a poor performance compared to acid faujasites.

What is remarkable in this alkylation of la with carbonylic reagents is the chemoselectivity with respect to the hydrolysis of the acetate functionality on the lateral chain. Furthermore, blocking of the hydroxy group by esterification was found to be a necessary requisite, since analogous treatment of the 3-(2-furyl)-l- propanol afforded the corresponding gem difuryl derivative in very low yield. In order to confirm the general applicability of acid faujasites as selective cata- lysts for the dialkylation of 2-substituted furans with aliphatic and unsaturated aldehydes, a set of experiments were carried out using 2-methylfuran as starting material. The results are contained in Table 3. The most salient feature of the condensation of furans with carbonyl compounds is that catalysis by acid large pore zeolites is remarkably more active and selective than by sulfuric acid under similar conditions. As can be seen in Tables 1 and 2 Table 3 Results of the condensation of 2-methylfuran (lb) ( 100 mg) with equimolar amounts of aldehydes in CCl4 (50 ml) in the presence of zeolites (250 rag) or sulfuric acid (50 mg) RCHO Catalyst Temperature Time Conversion Product () (h) (%)~' (yield-%)b HCHOc HYD- 1 24 24 - 4g ( 5 ) HCHO~ HYD-I 60 72 4g (31) CH3CHO HYD- 1 24 24 4h ( 81 ) CH3CHO H2SO4 (96%) 24 24 4h (23) n-CsHIICHO HYD-I 24 22 68 3i (1); 4i (64)d n-CsHI~CHO HYD-1 60 24 73 3i (3); 4i (36) PhCH=CHCHO HYD-I 60 96 35 5j~ ( 10); 6j (13); 7j (2) Based on reacted aldehyde. b Amount of product divided by initial amount of aldehyde (mol/tool).

Noteworthy, in the case 2-methylfuran, even formaldehyde gave rise to the corresponding difurylmethane 4g, albeit still with relatively poor chemical yield. For linear long chain aldehydes such as hexanal, products arising from the self aldolic condensation have also been observed. In spite of this undesired process, the selectivity of hexanal to the furan alkylation at room temperature has found to be higher than 90%, with a total yield of 64%. The reaction of 2-methylfuran with cinnamaldehyde gave a rather complex mixture with only moderate conversion. This, however, was to be expected in view of the fact that the conjugated C=C double bond can also intervene in Friedel- Crafts processes. In particular, we have already reported that cinnamyl alcohol, an alkylating reagent structurally very similar to the primary hydroxy intermediate 2j, reacts with furan la in the presence of acid zeolites with participation of the olefinic moiety [15]. A likely reaction mechanism to account for the products observed with cinnamaldehyde is presented in Scheme 3. In conclusion, we have found that acid large pore zeolites are very selective catalysts for the condensation of 2-alkyl substituted furans with aliphatic and aro- matic carbonyl compounds to give gem difuryl alkanes. Medium pore ZSM-5 or sulfuric acid were found to be less active and selective under the same experimental conditions. Further work is currently in progress in order to expand these results to other five membered heterocycles.

        "dc:description": "Condensation of 2-(3-acetoxypropyl)furan and 2-methylfuran with a series of aliphatic and aromatic carbonyl compounds, including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, hexanal, cinnamaldehyde, benzaldehyde, anisaldehyde and acetone has been carried out in the presence of acid zeolites of medium and large pore size at different reaction temperatures. While H-ZSM-5 and H-MOR exhibited lower activity, we have found that tridirectional large pore zeolites Y and β are very convenient catalysts. In some cases, total conversion with complete selectivity could be achieved under our experimental conditions. Sulfuric acid was less active and selective for this type of Friedel-Crafts condensations. The resulting gem difurylalkanes with 3-hydroxypropyl substituent at the 2 position of the furan ring can be precursors of bis-spiroketals with potential activity as juvenile hormone antagonist for the Mediterranean fly.",
