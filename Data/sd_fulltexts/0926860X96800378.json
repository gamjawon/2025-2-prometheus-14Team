Keywords: Vanadia/silica; Propane; Oxidative dehydrogenation; Propene productivity 1. Introduction The increasing demand for propene in the international market, as well as the general attempt to transform cheap and abundant feedstocks and by-products of oil refining processes into more valuable products, have recently resulted in great research interest into the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (POD). A large variety of unsupported and supported oxide catalysts have been claimed as being effective in the POD reaction [ 1-10], in particular V-Mg-O systems have been extensively studied in order to identify the active vanadate phases [ 1-4,6,7,10]. The performance of POD catalysts is usually described in terms of C3Hs conversion and selectivity to propene or yield per pass. Considering the potential industrial exploitation of the title reaction as an alternative to the running processes based on conventional dehydrogenation of propane (Oleflex and Catofin), the specific cat- alytic activity, expressed in terms of the observed rate of formation of propene per * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/96/$15.00 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, as shown in Table 1, amongst the oxide catalysts investigated in the POD reaction, V2Os-MgO systems reveal the best molar yield of propene, even if some limits in their practical suitability are taken into account. Indeed, rather high molar yield values have been achieved operating with a lean reaction mixture (C3H8 < 5%) and subsequently a low C3H6 concentration in the outlet stream is obtained, which makes its separation difficult. Here we are dealing with the activity of a certain vanadia-silica catalyst which can provide a high molar yield of C3H6 operating with high initial C3H8 concentration and very high productivity. 2. Experimental The 5%VzOs/SiO2 catalyst was prepared by impregnation of commercial pre- cipitated SiO2 ( Si 4-5P grade, Akzo product, SABEa- = 411 m2 g- 1 ) with a solution of ammonium metavanadate. The impregnated sample was dried at 90 and then calcined at 650 for 16 h. Catalytic measurements were carried out in a conven- tional flow microreactor connected on line with a GC unit equipped with a three column system (i. Porapak Q length 3.5 m, i.d. 1/8 in.; ii. Molecular Sieve, length 3 m, i.d. 1/8 in.; and iii. Carbowax 20M, length 3.5 m, i.d. 1/8 in.) and two detectors (TCD and FID). This analytical system permits the analysis of all prod- ucts (alkenes, alkanes and COx) including oxygenates (acrolein, propionaldehyde, acetaldehyde). The catalyst was tested at atmospheric pressure over a wide range Table 2 Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on SiO2 and 5% V2Os/SiO2 catalysts TR C3Hs/O2/Inert C3H8 Selectivity (%) () (%) Conv.

The reaction mixture was varied in terms of both C3H8 concentration (4.440%) and C3H8/O2 ratio (0.9-4) using N2 or steam as diluent. 3. Results and discussion The catalytic activity data of the 5%V205/SIO2 sample in terms of C3H8 con- version, product distribution, C3H6 concentration in the outlet stream, yield to C3H6 and STYc3H6 values, are presented in Table 2. For the sake of comparison the catalytic activity of the bare SiO2 support was also evaluated. Appropriate blank runs showed that, under our experimental conditions, the contribution of the gas phase reaction up to 650 is negligible. The results summarised in Table 2 indicate that the unpromoted silica bears a slight catalytic action in the temperature range 525-575, resulting in the formation of a considerable amount of oxygenates (mainly acrolein) along with propene and COx. However, V205 greatly enhances the performance of the bare SiO2. Indeed, the activity of the 5 %V205/SiO2 catalyst in the temperature range 450-675, even operating with rich feed mixtures (C3H8, 25-40%), ensures high molar yields to C3H6 with correspondingly high productiv- ity values and C3H6 concentration in the outlet stream. Additionally it can be seen from the above data that the 5%V2OJSiO2 catalyst provides the highest molar yield and productivity values with respect to the other oxide catalysts indicated up to now (Table 1 ). A more relevant finding is that at 675 with a rich reaction 50 40 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 REACTION TIldE (h) Z O 30 n, I,LI > Z O 20 O 10 25 20 P~ v 15 a ,-I I,LI 0 O Fig. 1.

Parmaliana et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) L1-L5 L5 mixture (C3H8 > 20%) a molar yield of 18% was obtained, resulting in a C3H6 concentration of about 5% in the outlet stream. Most notably, the catalyst still possesses a high activity at 655 (C3H8 conversion, 28.2%; C3H6 selectivity, 50%) in the presence of a large amount of steam (70%) in the reaction mixture, that allows it to reach a C3H6 concentration of 12% in the dry outlet stream. The performance of the 5%V205/8i02 catalyst at 650 in terms of C3H8 con- version and molar yield of C3H6 as a function of time on stream is presented in Fig. 1. The absence of any decline, either in activity or in yield during 12 h on stream, indicates that the 5%V205/SIO2 catalyst is stable in the POD reaction under the adopted operating conditions. Considering, therefore, the ability of the 5% V205/SiO2 catalyst to provide a high molar yield of C3H6 as well as a high productivity along with high C3H6 concentration, it appears to be a potential catalyst for further exploitation aimed at outlining the practical suitability of the POD reaction. Additional investigations are in progress, devoted to highlighting the nature of the active sites of the 5%V205/ SiO2 catalyst in the POD as well as the factors controlling the product distribution.
