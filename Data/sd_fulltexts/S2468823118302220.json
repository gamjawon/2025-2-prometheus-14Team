School of Materials Science and Engineering Nankai University Weijin Road 94 Tianjin 300071 China Graphical abstract Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts are prepared for NH3 decomposition, and the SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of ZSM-5 zeolites could significantly affect their catalytic performance. HZSM-5 zeolites with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios are employed as supports of Fe catalysts for NH3 decomposition. The structural and surface properties of the prepared Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts are characterized by solid-state NMR, XRD, N2 sorption, TEM, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD and XPS techniques, giving an insight into the active sites responsible for NH3 decomposition reaction. It is revealed that the catalytic activities of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts are correlated with the SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of ZSM-5 support. And the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of ZSM-5 zeolites could significantly affect the acidity, NH3 adsorption-desorption processes, metal-support interactions, and Fe particles size and distributions of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts, and thus, affecting their catalytic performance. The Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts with low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio exhibit high catalytic performance. Almost 99% NH3 decomposition could be achieved over the 5%Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst with SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 28 at 650 °C at a high space velocity of 30,000 cm3 h−1 gcat −1, suggesting a very promising catalyst in NH3 decomposition. Keywords Ammonia decomposition Hydrogen ZSM-5 Fe catalyst SiO2/Al2O3 ratio Support acidity 1 Introduction In recent years, hydrogen has drawn great attentions and been regarded as the most promising energy due to its abundance, zero emission and high energy density. However, the storage of hydrogen is still a great challenge for its practical application. Some of efficient hydrogen carriers, such as ammonia borane, methanol, formic acid and NH3 [1,2], are developed. Among these materials, NH3 possesses many advantages such as mass production, high hydrogen content (17.6 wt%), easy liquefaction and transportation, which represents a very promising hydrogen carrier [3–5]. Furthermore, on-site generation of hydrogen from NH3 can efficiently avoid COx components that are harmful for proton-exchange membrane fuel cell [6,7]. Many works have been devoted to exploit efficient catalysts for NH3 decomposition. Especially, Ru catalyst is demonstrated the most active catalyst for NH3 decomposition [8–10], though the high cost and low availability of Ru limit its practical application. While, among these non-noble metal catalysts, Fe nanocatalyst is regarded as one of the most promising catalysts in NH3 decomposition because of its high catalytic activity, low price and long-term stability [11–13]. To improve the catalytic activity of Fe catalysts, great efforts have been made by loading Fe on the supports. After Fe is supported, its several properties (such as active phase sizes and distribution, reducibility, and thermal stability) would be changed. Previous works have reported that the structural properties, phase composition and thermal stability of the supports could significantly affect the catalytic performance of Fe-based catalysts [14,15]. To date, metal oxides (SiO2, TiO2, CeO2, etc.) and nanocarbons (such as carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbon, and graphite) are usually used as supports of Fe-based catalysts [11–18]. However, the low porosity of metal oxides and difficult preparation of nanocarbons limit their wide application. Zeolite possesses high surface area, well-organized porous structure, good thermal stability and tunable acid-base properties, which represents a very promising catalyst or support [19,20]. Over the past several decades, many supported metal-zeolite catalysts have been synthesized and investigated for various reactions, such as selective reduction of NOx, phenol reforming, ethylene carbonylation, and isobutyl alcohol aromatization [21–25]. In these reactions, the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of zeolite plays an important role on the reactants and products adsorption-desorption processes, particle size and distribution, and metal-support interactions, which could make great influence on the catalytic performance. For instance, the high acidity of SSZ-13 zeolite could promote the catalytic performance of Cu/SSZ-13 catalysts in NO2 reduction [21], because the high acidity of SSZ-13 zeolite could increase the ammonia concentrations near the active sites. Mo/Y catalysts with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratio were reported to possess more and stronger interactions between active phase and the support, which are good for ethylene carbonylation [23]. Also it was reported that Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst with low SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio exhibited much high catalytic activity for phenol reforming [24]. Furthermore, a series of Fe-zeolite catalysts were synthesized and investigated for NH3 decomposition [26,27]. However, there has no systematic study about the influence of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of zeolite supports on the catalytic performances of Fe/zeolite catalysts in NH3 decomposition so far. And the correlation of catalyst acidity and activity is very important to make clear the role of acidic sites of solid catalyst in NH3 decomposition reaction. In this contribution, a series of HZSM-5 with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (28, 43, 80 and 260) were employed as supports of iron catalysts prepared by a wet impregnation method. The resultant Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts were used for NH3 decomposition. The structural and textural properties, acidity, reducibility and Fe crystallite sizes were all measured to illustrate the effect factors of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts. Furthermore, the effects of Fe loading amount on the catalytic performance of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts were also investigated in detail. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Chemicals and catalyst preparation HZSM-5 zeolites with SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of 28, 43, 80 and 260 were supplied by Tianjin Shenneng Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. Fe(NO3)2·9H2O was obtained from the Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Co. The Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by the wet impregnation method. Typically, the calculated amount of Fe(NO3)2·9H2O was dissolved into 20 mL of distilled water. Then, 1 g of dried ZSM-5 was immersed into the above solution under stirring for 2 h. Afterwards, the mixture was evaporated at 100 °C, dried at 110 °C for 12 h, and subsequently calcined at 600 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 5 °C/mim. The resultant samples were denoted as x%Fe/ZSM-5(y), where x represents the calculated Fe loading amounts and y represents the SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of ZSM-5 zeolite. 2.2 Characterization Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tests were carried out on a Bruker AVC400 spectrometer at resonance frequencies of 79.5 and 104.3 MHz for 29Si and 27Al, respectively. The 29Si MAS NMR spectra were tested after π/4 single pulse excitations, with repetition of 10 s at a spinning rate of 5 kHz. The 27Al MAS NMR spectra were tested after π/6 single pulse excitations, with repetition times of 0.5 s at a spinning rate of 8 kHz. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a Jeol JEM-2800 microscope at 200 kV. N2 adsorption-desorption analysis was carried out on a Quantachrome NOVA 2000e sorption analyzer at 77 K. The specific surface area (S BET) was calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The total pore volume (V total) was obtained at the relative pressure of P/P 0 = 0.99. Before the test, every sample was degassed under vacuum for over 6 h. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were tested on a Quantachrome ChemBET 3000 analyzer. For each experiment, 50 mg of sample was degassed at 200 °C in He for 2 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the sample was reduced by 10%H2/Ar mixed gas (20 mL/min) with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) experiments were performed on a Quantachrome ChemBET 3000 analyzer. For each test, 200 mg of sample was degassed at 600 °C in He for 2 h. After cooling down to 80 °C, 5%NH3/Ar mixture gas shifted to the sample and maintained for 30 min at 80 °C. Then, the sample was swept by He to baseline. And the desorbed signal was measured by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 2.3 Catalytic tests The NH3 decomposition experiments over Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts were tested in a fixed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. Typically, 0.1 g of the catalyst was put into a quartz reactor (5 mm i.d.) and in-situ reduced by flowing H2 (20 mL/min) at 600 °C for 1 h. After cooling down to room temperature, pure NH3 (50 mL/min) was introduced into the reactor and purged for 1 h. Then, the reactor was heated to the desired temperature, and the products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (GC, SP-6800A6). The catalytic activity was calculated as the NH3 conversion, and the H2 formation rate was calculated from the H2 content in the out gas. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of the Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance is an effective technique that can be used to characterize the chemical state and environment of Al and Si species in zeolites. Fig. 1 shows the 27Al and 29Si NMR spectra of HZSM-5 zeolites with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (28, 43, 80, and 260). As shown in Fig. 1a, two peaks at ∼0 and 55 ppm can be clearly observed in the 27Al NMR spectra of ZSM-5(28) and ZSM-5(43), corresponding to the extra-framework Al species and four-coordinated framework Al species, respectively [28–30]. While only one peak can be observed at ∼55 ppm over the ZSM-5(80) and ZSM-5(260) zeolites, indicating the absence of extra-framework Al species. The intensity of the peak at ∼0 ppm over ZSM-5(28) zeolite is much stronger than that of ZSM-5(43) zeolite, indicating the formation of more extra-framework Al species by decreasing SiO2/Al2O3 ratios. Similar results were reported on SSZ-13 zeolites, in which the framework Al would become more dominate as Si/Al ratios increasing [23]. As to the 29Si NMR spectra (Fig. 1b), three main peaks can be observed in all ZSM-5 zeolites. The peak at −106 ppm is assigned to the framework Si atoms with one Al neighbor, i.e., Si(3Si, 1Al) species [31–33]. The peaks at −113 and −116 ppm correspond to the framework Si(4Si, 0Al) species at two different crystallographic sites [33,34]. It is notable that the signals at −113 and −116 ppm become more dominant with the increase of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, confirming the decrease of Al species. The XRD patterns of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 , and the raw HZSM-5(28) is also provided as a reference. As shown in Fig. 2a, all the samples possess a series of diffraction peaks of MFI structure, indicating that the structure of ZSM-5 is maintained after loading Fe species. While no obvious diffraction peaks of Fe species can be observed in all the 5%Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts, probably due to the low content or high dispersion of Fe species [35,36]. As to the Fe/ZSM-5(28) catalysts with different amounts of Fe species (Fig. 2b), besides the diffraction peaks of ZSM-5 zeolite, two new broad peaks at 2θ = 33.4° and 35.7°, which are attributed to the (1 0 4) and (1 1 0) crystallite planes of α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS No. 33-0664) [37,38], can be observed in Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts only when the Fe loading amount up to 7%, indicating the growth of iron oxides with the increase of Fe loading. The microstructures and textural properties of raw ZSM-5 zeolites and Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts were characterized by N2 sorption technique, and the corresponding results are listed in Table 1 . Noticeably, all the ZSM-5 samples possess high surface area of over 350 m2/g and large pore volume of over 0.30 cm3/g. After loading with Fe species, a slight decrease of surface area and pore volume can be observed for the Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts. The specific surface areas and pore volumes of 5%Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios are similar to each other, indicating the presence of similar porous structures. As to the Fe/ZSM-5(28) catalysts with different Fe contents, the surface area and pore volume decrease with the increase of Fe loading amount. This is probably due to the Fe species incorporation into the pores or deposition onto the surface of ZSM-5 zeolites, blocking a number of nanopores. NH3-TPD is usually used to characterize the acid sites in zeolites. Fig. S1 and Fig. 3 a show the NH3-TPD curves of raw HZSM-5 zeolite and 5%Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios respectively, and the corresponding quantified titration results are listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. S1, two or three peaks observed over the HZSM-5 zeolites can be attributed to the physisorbed NH3 (weak acid sites, 100–200 °C), weakly chemisorbed NH3 (moderate strong acid sites, 200–400 °C) and strongly chemisorbed NH3 (strong acid sites, 400–600 °C), respectively [39,40]. The intensity of NH3-TPD curves of raw HZSM-5 zeolite increases with the decrease of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of catalysts, in accordance with that the acidity of zeolite is mainly dependent on the Al content. After loading with Fe species, the NH3-TPD curves of Fe/ZSM-5 are similar with those of raw HZSM-5 (Fig. S1). However, the acidity of Fe/ZSM-5 shows a slight decrease as compared with raw HZSM-5. Fig. 3b shows the NH3 desorption amounts as a function of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios. Obviously, the total acid sites of Fe/ZSM-5 samples decrease with the increase of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios. At low SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (≤80), the total NH3 desorption amounts exhibit an excellent liner relationship to the SiO2/Al2O3 ratios. When the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is higher than 80, a continuous decrease of the NH3 desorption can be observed. Meanwhile, the peaks α, β and γ exhibit similar trends to the total NH3 desorption. This result further confirms that the SiO2/Al2O3 ratios have an important influence on the acidic properties of ZSM-5 zeolites. NH3-TPD tests were also carried out on Fe/ZSM-5(28) catalysts with different Fe loading (Fig. 3c and Fig. S2), and the corresponding NH3 desorption amounts calculated from the NH3-TPD curves as a function of Fe loading amounts are shown in Fig. 3d. As shown in Fig. 3c, the shapes of all NH3-TPD curves are similar to each other, indicating the presence of similar acid types. While the intensities of NH3-TPD curves decrease with the increase of Fe loading amounts. This indicates that the acidity of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts decrease with the increase of Fe loading. The NH3 desorption amounts of peaks α, β and γ show similar trends to the total NH3 desorption amounts. And the weak acidity, moderate strong acidity and strong acidity decrease with increasing Fe loading amount (Fig. 3d). This is probably due to a number of Fe species incorporated into ZSM-5 framework structure, balancing the acidity of ZSM-5 zeolite [21,41,42]. Fig. 4 shows the TEM images of 5%Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios. The corresponding particle size distributions are shown in Fig. S3. As shown in Fig. 4a, c, e and g, the micro-morphologies of these samples are various with the SiO2/Al2O3 ratios. Particularly, the Fe species loaded onto ZSM-5(28) show smaller nanoparticles and higher dispersion than those loaded onto the other ZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 ratios = 43, 80 and 260) zeolites, in good accordance with the earlier studies [43,44]. Deep magnifications of 5%Fe/ZSM-5(28) and 5%Fe/ZSM-5(43) catalysts show that a number of nano-sized Fe particles are successfully incorporated into the channels of ZSM-5 support (Fig. 4b and d), further confirming the high dispersion of Fe species of 5%Fe/ZSM-5(28) and 5%Fe/ZSM-5(43) catalysts. As to 5%Fe/ZSM-5(80) and 5%Fe/ZSM-5(260) catalysts, larger particles can be observed over these two samples. As shown in Fig. S3, the particle size of Fe species in 5%Fe/ZSM-5(28/43/80/260) catalysts are mainly distributed in 6.9 ± 1.3, 7.5 ± 2.0, 13.0 ± 2.0 and 14.2 ± 2.3 nm, respectively. This illustrates that the SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of the zeolites could significantly affect the particle size and dispersion of the active species, which would make great influence on the catalytic performance. To make clear the influence of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of ZSM-5 supports on the catalytic activity of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts, the reducing properties of pure Fe2O3 and 5%Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios were measured by H2-TPR (Fig. 5 ). As to pure Fe2O3, the reduction starts at about 240 °C and exhibits three main peaks centered at 357, 512 and 573 °C, respectively. The peak at 357 °C corresponds to the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 (peak I), the peak at 512 °C is assigned to the reduction of Fe3O4 to FeO (peak II), and the peak at 573 °C is attributed to the reduction of FeO to Fe (peak III), respectively [45,46]. All the 5%Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts show these three peaks, though the position of these peaks are a little higher than that of pure Fe2O3, indicating the presence of strong metal-support interactions between Fe and ZSM-5 zeolite [35,46]. Noticeably, the centers of these peaks shift to higher temperature with the decrease of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of catalysts, revealing the formation of more and stronger metal-support interactions as the SiO2/Al2O3 ratios decreasing. This result is in good accordance with the previous report that the positively charged metal complexes would be bonded onto the negatively charged frameworks (AlO4 −), forming highly stable [Fe(III)-μO2-Fe(III)]2+[Al-O-(Si-O)n=2-Al]2− and/or Fe(III)Ox oligomers-[(Si-O)n>2-Al-O-(Si-O)n>2]− species by chemical reaction [47]. To make clear the surface compositions and chemical state of Fe species in Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts, the XPS technique was applied. Fig. 6 shows the Fe 2p XPS spectra of 5%Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, and the corresponding survey spectra and O 1s spectra are shown in Fig. S4. As shown in Fig. S4a, the survey spectra reveal the presence of Si, O, Al and Fe in the prepared Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts. The XPS O 1s spectra (Fig. S4b) suggest the existence of two kinds of oxygen in the Fe/ZSM-5 samples, corresponding to the lattice oxygen O2− and adsorbed oxygen [48,49]. As to the XPS Fe 2p spectra (Fig. 6), two broad peaks located at about 711.3 and 725.0 eV can be observed in all the Fe/ZSM-5 samples, corresponding to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively [50,51]. Noticeably, the centers of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 shift to lower binding energy with the decrease of zeolite SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, suggesting the enhanced metal-support interaction between Fe and ZSM-5 support. It was reported that the Al content and distribution could affect the structure of Fe species and redox properties of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts, and a number of Fe(II), [Fe(II)–O–Fe(II)]2+ and oligonuclear Fe(II)–O would be formed in the framework of [Al-O-(Si-O)n=2-Al]2− [47,52]. At low SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, Fe2+ species would be formed on the ZSM-5 supports, leading to lower binding energy of Fe 2p XPS spectra. This result is consistent with the H2-TPR results in Fig. 5. 3.2 Catalytic activity of the Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts The catalytic activities of the prepared Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts for ammonia decomposition were tested in a quartz reactor under an atmospheric pressure, and the results are shown in Figs. 7 and 8 . As shown in Fig. 7, the NH3 conversions over all the 5%Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts increase with the catalytic reaction temperature, in consistent with the endothermic character of NH3 decomposition reaction (ΔH r θs = 46 kJ mol−1) [6,53]. It is notable that the catalytic activities of 5%Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts increase with the decrease of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of ZSM-5 zeolites. Among the 5%Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, 5%Fe/ZSM-5(28) shows the highest catalytic activity with T 50 and T 90 values of about 565 and 630 °C, respectively. While the T 50 and T 90 values of 5%Fe/ZSM-5(43) catalyst are about 576 and 646 °C, respectively, which are a little higher than those of Fe/ZSM-5(28). As to 5%Fe/ZSM-5(80) and 5%Fe/ZSM-5(260) catalysts, their T 50 and T 90 values are much higher than those of 5%Fe/ZSM-5(28) catalyst, i.e., T 90 values for 5%Fe/ZSM-5(80) and 5%Fe/ZSM-5(260) catalysts are 674 and 691 °C, respectively. Fig. S5 shows the corresponding H2 formation rates, exhibiting similar trends to the NH3 conversion curve. At 650 °C, the H2 formation rates of 33.1, 30.9, 24.9 and 22.3 mmolH2 min−1 g−1 can be achieved over the 5%Fe/ZSM-5(28), 5%Fe/ZSM-5(43), 5%Fe/ZSM-5(80) and 5%Fe/ZSM-5(260) catalysts, respectively, indicating the influence of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of ZSM-5 support on the activity of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts for NH3 decomposition. Fig. 8 shows the catalytic activity of Fe/ZSM-5(28) catalysts with different Fe loading amounts for NH3 decomposition, and the corresponding H2 formation rates are shown in Fig. S6. The raw ZSM-5 shows almost no catalytic activity (Fig. 8). After loading 1%Fe species, the catalytic activity increases sharply, and 69.5% NH3 conversion can be obtained over 1%Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst at the reaction temperature of 700 °C, indicating the main active sites of Fe species. It was reported that the size of iron particles played an important role on the catalytic performance of Fe-based catalysts in NH3 decomposition and smaller Fe particles exhibited higher catalytic activities [13,54]. Herein, all the Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit a starting reaction temperature of 400 °C, indicating a good catalysts system for NH3 decomposition. The porous structure and high surface area of ZSM-5 support could increase the dispersion of Fe species, which would be beneficial for NH3 decomposition. As shown in Fig. 8, the catalytic activity of Fe/ZSM-5(28) catalysts increases with the Fe loading amount from 0 to 5%. Especially, the 5%Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits the best catalytic performance with T 50 (565 °C) and T 90 (630 °C) lower than 3%Fe/ZSM-5 (T 50 = 603 °C, T 90 = 683 °C). However, when the Fe loading amount excesses a certain value of 5%, further increasing the Fe content would lead to the decrease of catalytic activity. This is probably due to the aggregation of Fe species at high Fe loading. Similar results were reported on many previous supported catalysts, in which the activity increased with metal loading at low loading amount, but the changes was not much at high metal loading [12,38]. The corresponding H2 formation rates of all these x%Fe/ZSM-5(28) samples are shown in Fig. S6. It is notable that ∼99% NH3 conversion with 33.1 mmolH2 min−1 g−1 H2 formation rate can be obtained over the 5%Fe/ZSM-5(28) at the temperature of 650 °C, which is much higher than many previous literatures, and the detailed comparisons are listed in Table S1. 3.3 Discussion To investigate the effect of support acidity on the catalytic activity of Fe-based catalysts for NH3 decomposition, ZSM-5 zeolites with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios were employed as supports of iron catalysts. Indeed, the SiO2/Al2O3 ratios influence not only the acidity but also the metal-support interaction, and the Fe particle size and distribution. Herein, we use NH3-TPD to measure the acidity of prepared catalysts, H2-TPR to characterize the reducibility of Fe species, and TEM to analyze the Fe particle size and distribution. From the above physicochemical characterization and catalytic results, it is revealed that the acidity of ZSM-5 support plays a beneficial role in the catalytic process of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts for NH3 decomposition reaction. And the Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts with low SiO2/Al2O3 ratios possess strong metal-support interaction and small Fe nanoparticles, which exhibit high catalytic performance for NH3 decomposition. To better understanding the influence of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios on the catalytic performance of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts in NH3 decomposition, the linear relationship between the catalytic activity (H2 formation rate) and the acidity of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts are shown in Fig. 9 . As shown in Fig. 9a, the H2 formation rates over 5%Fe/ZSM-5(28/43/80/260) catalysts show good linear relationships to the total NH3 desorption amounts of 5%Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts at different temperatures. The H2 formation rates over all the Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts increase with the decrease of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios. Especially, the 5%Fe/ZSM-5 with low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 28 shows the highest H2 formation rate, i.e., 3.9, 12.8, 25.2 and 33.0 mmolH2 min−1 g−1 H2 formation rates at 500, 550, 600 and 650 °C, respectively. As compared among Fig. 9b–d, peaks β exhibit better linear relation to the H2 formation rates of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts than peaks α and γ. Peak β corresponds to Lewis acid sites originated from Si-OH-Al species. In ammonia decomposition process, ammonia would be adsorbed onto the Si-OH-Al species, forming [NH4]+[Si-O-Al-O-Si]− species [55,56]. Then, the adsorbed NH3 would be decomposed by Fe species. The high acidity of ZSM-5 support could obviously increase the NH3 concentration near the active sites, benefiting the catalytic reaction [21]. Nagaoka et al. also reported that NH3 adsorbed onto the acidic support was exothermic which could obviously lower the NH3 decomposition temperature [57]. It is previously reported that the metal ions bonded with two Al T-sites in the windows of 6MRs are very stable [27,51]. Upon iron loading onto ZSM-5 supports, Fe species would be easily bonded with the negatively charged frameworks (AlO4 −). At low SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, the framework [Al-O-(Si-O)n=2-Al]2− species in ZSM-5 would be increased, which are beneficial for the formation of highly dispersed and stable Fe species. The XPS spectra (Fig. 6) show that the Fe 2p XPS spectra shift to lower binding energy with the decrease of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, probably due to the formation of more Fe(II) species [47,52]. This indicates the formation of strong metal-support interactions between Fe and ZSM-5 support. Correspondingly, H2-TPR results (Fig. 5) show that the reduction temperature of Fe/ZSM-5 is much higher than that of pure Fe2O3, further confirming that the formation of strong metal-support interaction between Fe and ZSM-5 support. Gao et al. [58] reported that the isolated Cr oxide species and crystalline Cr2O3 would be formed in Cr/ZSM-5 samples at high SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, while the isolated Cr oxides species anchored on the exposed Al sites became dominated. So, more Fe species would be anchored onto the Al sites at lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, and thus, increasing the reduction temperature of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts. Furthermore, the strong metal-support interaction could dramatically enhance the dispersion and stability of metal/metal oxides on supports, and resist sintering of catalyst particles during catalysis [59,60]. Also, the particle sizes of Fe species decrease with the SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, and the Fe/ZSM-5(28) catalyst shows the smaller particle size and higher dispersion of Fe species than 5%Fe/ZSM-5(43/80/260) catalysts (Fig. 4), which is in good accordance with the H2-TPR results (Fig. 5). And these Fe nanoparticles are responsible for the high catalytic performance [11,12]. Overall, from the catalytic performance and physicochemical characterizations of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts, it is seen that the acidity of ZSM-5 support plays an important role in Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts for NH3 decomposition. And the acidity of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts favors the reaction without being an essential ingredient of the active sites and reaction mechanism. The high acidity of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts could promote the NH3 decomposition by increasing NH3 concentrations near the Fe active sites. The iron catalysts supported on ZSM-5 zeolites with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios possesses better physicochemical properties (such as small particle size and high distribution of Fe species, and strong metal-support interactions), which are good for the catalytic performance in NH3 decomposition. Additionally, the Fe loading amount is another important role that can significantly affect the catalytic performance of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts. As shown in Fig. 8, the catalytic activity of Fe/ZSM-5(28) catalysts increases with the Fe loading from 0 to 5%. While, when the Fe loading exceeds a certain value of 5%, further increasing the Fe content would result in the decrease of catalytic activity. Among these catalysts, the 5%Fe/ZSM-5(28) exhibits the highest catalytic activity for NH3 decomposition. The highly dispersed Fe species are responsible to the NH3 decomposition, and large Fe nanoparticles have little contribution to this reaction. So, suitable Fe contents, high acidity and rich porous structure of ZSM-5 support are responsible to the high catalytic performance of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts in NH3 decomposition reaction. 4 Conclusions Iron catalysts supported on ZSM-5 zeolites with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios have been prepared by wet impregnation method. The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of ZSM-5 support could obviously affect the catalyst properties of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts. With decreasing SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, the dispersion and reduction barrier of Fe species in Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts would progressively increase due to the formation of strong metal-support interactions between Fe and ZSM-5 support. The Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts were used for NH3 decomposition, exhibiting the increased catalytic activity with decreasing SiO2/Al2O3 ratios. And the acidity of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts shows a good linear relation to the H2 formation rates in NH3 decomposition. The higher acidity of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts could promote the NH3 decomposition by increasing NH3 concentrations near the Fe active sites. Furthermore, the Fe loading amount had a significant influence on the catalytic performance of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts. At low Fe content, the catalyst activity increases with the Fe loading, but the activity would decrease when the Fe loading is higher than 5%. And suitable Fe contents, high acidity and rich porous structure of ZSM-5 support are responsible to the high catalytic performance. As a result, the Fe/ZSM-5 with SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 28 and 5%Fe loading exhibits the highest catalytic performance, and ∼99% NH3 conversion can be achieved at the temperature of 650 °C.

        "dc:description": "HZSM-5 zeolites with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios are employed as supports of Fe catalysts for NH3 decomposition. The structural and surface properties of the prepared Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts are characterized by solid-state NMR, XRD, N2 sorption, TEM, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD and XPS techniques, giving an insight into the active sites responsible for NH3 decomposition reaction. It is revealed that the catalytic activities of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts are correlated with the SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of ZSM-5 support. And the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of ZSM-5 zeolites could significantly affect the acidity, NH3 adsorption-desorption processes, metal-support interactions, and Fe particles size and distributions of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts, and thus, affecting their catalytic performance. The Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts with low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio exhibit high catalytic performance. Almost 99% NH3 decomposition could be achieved over the 5%Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst with SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 28 at 650 °C at a high space velocity of 30,000 cm3 h−1 gcat −1, suggesting a very promising catalyst in NH3 decomposition.",
