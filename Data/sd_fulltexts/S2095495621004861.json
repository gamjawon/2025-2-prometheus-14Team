Graphical abstract The flower-like γ-NiOOH derived from deep reconstruction of Ni-Mo-Se precatalyst is constituted by ultrathin nanosheets with a thickness of only ∼4.5 nm, which exhibits superior OER activity, outperforming almost all the reported analogues. Transition metal chalcogenides will be in situ transformed into metal oxyhydroxides during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process in alkaline medium. However, most of these compounds only undergo surface reconstruction under operating conditions, which contains a large percentage of inactive atoms in the core, thus limiting the exposure of the active sites. Here, we synthesize a Ni-Mo-Se precatalyst with three-dimensional hierarchical structure and develop a facile on-site electrochemical activation strategy for achieving deep reconstruction of the precatalyst. Using the combination of multiple spectroscopic characterizations and high resolution electron microscopy techniques, we unravel that the Ni-Mo-Se precatalyst is deeply reconstructed into γ-NiOOH with co-leaching of Mo and Se after the anodic oxidation. Such flower-like γ-NiOOH is constituted by distorted ultrathin nanosheets with a thickness of ∼ 4.5 nm and contains abundant intercalated species such as water and OH–/CO3 2–, thus offering a large quantity of accessible active sites. To reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2, the derived electrode requires an overpotential of only 244 mV, outperforming almost all the reported analogues. This work highlights the reconstruction chemistry and provides a simple method for the preparation of efficient OER electrocatalyst. Keywords Electrocatalyst Deep reconstruction NiOOH Ni-Mo-Se Oxygen evolution reaction 1 Introduction Electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a significant half-reaction in many renewable energy conversion and storage technologies, such as water splitting, CO2 reduction, nitrogen fixation, and metal-air batteries [1,2]. However, the efficiency of OER is often limited by the sluggish kinetics which involves multiple proton-coupled electron transfers [3,4]. Although noble metal-based catalysts such as IrO2 and RuO2 exhibit good OER activity, their scarcity and high cost prevent widespread applications [5,6]. Therefore, great efforts have been devoted to develop non-precious OER catalysts. Recently, earth-abundant catalysts based on 3d transition metals are considered as promising alternatives for OER in alkaline electrolyte [7–11]. Among them, Ni-based oxides including NiO, Ni(OH)2, NiCo2O4, NiWO4, and NiMoO4 are widely investigated due to their low cost, nontoxicity, and considerable electrocatalytic activity [12–16]. However, their catalytic performance is still restricted by poor electronic conductivity and mediocre intrinsic activity. In order to boost the electrocatalytic activity of Ni-based oxides, further selenization can optimize the electronic conductivity and tune the electronic structures of catalytic centers, thus accelerating OER [17]. In fact, whether Ni-based oxides or selenides, most of these compounds would undergo surface reconstruction during the OER process, accompanied by the weakened crystallinity, reduced crystalline grain, and increased active area [18,19]. As a result, the in situ formed high-valence metal oxides or (oxy)hydroxides covered on the bulk phase are always identified as the real active species. For instance, Xu et al. discovered that an amorphous oxide layer with thicknesses of 3–8 nm formed on the surface of multiple Ni-based materials (NiO, NiSe, Ni3Se2 and Ni) during OER catalysis [20]. Similarly, an active oxyhydroxide layer (Ni1- x Fe x OOH) was generated on the surface of (Ni0.75Fe0.25)Se2 nanosheets after OER test [21]. As these examples illustrate, most of post-OER catalysts always exhibit a near-surface reconstruction structure at the nanoscale, such as a core–shell structure which contains a large percentage of inactive atoms in the core [22]. Therefore, the endeavor toward achieving deep reconstruction which can maximize the number of active sites is significant for enhancing mass specific activity of catalysts. So far, few studies have focused on the deep reconstruction process of the catalysts, because it is difficult for the electrolyte to pass through the dense surface layer of the catalysts [23]. In order to overcome the difficulty, by means of morphology engineering, constructing an electrode material with abundant pore channels and a large specific surface area should be an effective method to shorten ion diffusion path and thus promote deep reconstruction under electro-oxidation conditions. Here, we report a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical Ni-Mo-Se micro-flower with nanosheets as building blocks using a simple hydrothermal method. Various in/ex situ technologies demonstrate that the Ni-Mo-Se micro-flower is merely a precatalyst for OER and, under anodic oxidation conditions, is deeply reconstructed into γ-NiOOH ultrathin nanosheets by co-leaching of Se and Mo. Such derived γ-NiOOH with intercalated OH–/CO3 2– provides a large quantity of accessible active sites and serves as a highly active structure. To reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2, it requires an overpotential of only 244 mV, which outperforms almost all the reported Fe-free NiOOH-based electrocatalysts. This work not only deepens the understanding of reconstruction chemistry but also offers a promising strategy for the preparation of cheap and efficient OER electrocatalyst. 2 Material and methods 2.1 Synthesis of Ni-Mo-O/NF All chemicals were used as received without further purification. The Ni-Mo-O/NF was synthesized by one-step hydrothermal method. In a typical synthesis, a piece of commercial nickel foam (NF, 2 × 2 cm) was sonicated in deionized water and ethanol for 30 min, respectively. After that, the NF was weighed after being dried at 60 ℃ in an air-flow oven. Then, 0.2908 g (1 mmol) Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.0242 g (0.1 mmol) Na2MoO4·2H2O were dissolved in deionized water (30 mL) under vigorous stirring until the solution became clear. Then, the pretreated NF was immersed in the above-mentioned solution and reacted in a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave at 200 ℃ for 18 h. After completing the reaction, the NF was removed from the reaction vessel, and washed with deionized water and ethanol, and dried in an air-flow oven at 60 ℃. The mass loading of Ni-Mo-O is determined by measuring the mass difference of NF before and after the hydrothermal reaction. Based on five parallel experiments, the average mass loading of Ni-Mo-O was calculated as ∼ 2.8 mg cm−2. 2.2 Synthesis of Ni-Mo-Se/NF 0.158 g Se powder and 0.152 g NaBH4 were dissolved in 30 mL DI water to form a clear solution after stirring for 10 min at room temperature. Then the solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with the synthesized Ni-Mo-O/NF to proceed the hydrothermal reaction at 180 ℃ for 2 h. After naturally cooled down to room temperature, the black product was washed several times with water and ethanol before drying overnight at 60 ℃ in an oven. The mass loading of Ni-Mo-Se is determined by measuring the mass difference of NF before and after the hydrothermal reaction. Based on five parallel experiments, the average mass loading of Ni-Mo-Se was calculated as ∼ 6.0 mg cm−2. 2.3 Characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by a Rigaku D/M ax-2400 at a scanning rate of 10° min−1 over a 2θ range of 20-80°. Field-emission scanning electron microscopic (FESEM) images and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) characterization were taken on a FEI Apreo S FESEM at an acceleration voltage of 30 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed on a TecnaiTM G2 F30 TEM working on an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images and elemental electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) maps were acquired on a aberration-corrected TEM (Titan Themes Cubed G2 300) operated at 300 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected through an Axis Supra X-ray photo-electron spectrometer using 450 W non-monochromatic Al/Mg radiation. The binding energies for all spectra were calibrated with respect to the C 1 s line at 284.6 eV. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was carried out on an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (Plasma Quant PQ9000). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis was performed on a MFP-3D magnetic force microscopy. 2.4 KOH electrolyte purification The electrolyte (1 M KOH) that we used in the whole electrochemical tests was prepared with KOH (GR, 95%). In order to exclude the influence of Fe impurity on the anodic reconstruction process and the OER test, the electrolyte (1 M KOH) that we used was further purified according to a procedure reported by Boettcher’s group [24]. Briefly, 2 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was first weighed and dissolved in 4 mL deionized water, and then 20 mL of 1 M KOH was poured into the above solution to precipitate high-purity Ni(OH)2. The mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant was decanted. Next, wash the obtained Ni(OH)2 three times with a mixed solution of deionized water (20 mL) and 1 M KOH (2 mL). Finally, the Ni(OH)2 solid was redispersed in 50 mL of 1 M KOH, stirred vigorously for 30 min, followed by 4 h of resting. The mixture was centrifuged, and the purified KOH supernatant was collected for use. 2.5 Electrochemical measurements All electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation using a typical three-electrode configuration at room temperature (∼25 ℃). The as-prepared sample, graphite rod, and Hg/HgO electrode were used as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. All measured potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the equation: E RHE = EHg/HgO + 0.098 + 0.059 × pH. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were recorded at a scanning rate of 5 mV s−1 with iR-corrected. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were applied to probe the electrochemical double layer capacitance (C dl) at non-faradaic region (1.024–1.124 V vs. RHE) for estimating the effective electrochemical surface area. The stability test was performed by means of chronopotentiometry (CP) measurement under a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were carried out at a potential of 1.52 V (vs. RHE) with a frequency range from 100 KHz to 0.01 Hz and an amplitude of 5 mV. 2.6 Potential-dependent in situ Raman spectroscopy Raman spectroscopy was recorded on a laser confocal Raman specctrometer (Lab RAM HR Evolution) using an excitation of 532 nm laser under controlled potentials by an electrochemical workstation. The electrolytic cell was homemade by Teflon with a piece of round quartz glass as the cover to protect the objective. The working electrode was set to keep the plane of the sample perpendicular to the incident laser. Pt wire was used as the counter electrode. Ag/AgCl electrode with an inner reference electrolyte of saturated KCl solution was used as the reference electrode. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization and analysis of precatalysts As shown in Fig. 1 (a), 3D hierarchical Ni-Mo-Se micro-flowers on Ni foam (NF) were synthesized via a two-step hydrothermal approach. Firstly, Ni-Mo-O precursors were prepared, serving as a sacrificial template. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Ni-Mo-O precursor is consistent with the standard diffraction patterns of Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS card no. 1–1047) and NiMoO4 (JCPDS card no. 8–357) (Fig. 1b), demonstrating that Ni-Mo-O is a two-component mixture composed by NiMoO4 and Ni(OH)2. According to the XRD results and synthetic details, a plausible reaction mechanism of the Ni-Mo-O is proposed, and the corresponding reaction equations are described in the Supporting Information. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images reveal that a layer of Ni-Mo-O microspheres with a diameter of ∼ 3 μm are deposited on the surface of NF framework, which are composed of numerous nanosheets, showing a hierarchical flower-like morphology (Fig. 1c). After the second hydrothermal reaction of Ni-Mo-O/NF in NaHSe solution, the XRD pattern of the obtained Ni-Mo-Se/NF in Fig. 1(b) shows a set of diffraction peaks at 33.1°, 50.1°, 59.6°, etc., from hexagonal NiSe phase (JCPDS card no. 2–892) except for the peaks at 44.5°, 51.9°, and 76.4° from Ni foam, suggesting the formation of NiSe on the NF. Interestingly, besides the vibration modes of NiSe, the Raman spectrum of the as-synthesized Ni-Mo-Se/NF also exhibits characteristic Raman peaks of MoSe2 (Fig. 1f). Typically, the Raman bands at ∼ 168 and ∼ 240 cm−1 are associated with the phonon modes of 2H-MoSe2 [25]. And the peaks at ∼ 145, ∼201, and ∼ 346 cm−1 are assigned to Raman modes of 1 T-MoSe2 [26]. The peak at 284 cm−1 could be originated from the Se-Se vibrational mode [26]. Due to the low content of Mo (6.8 at%, Fig. S1) and/or poor crystallinity, the newly-formed MoSe2 phase is hardly detected by the XRD. SEM images show that Ni-Mo-Se inherits the morphology of Ni-Mo-O micro-flowers overall, while the thickness of the nanosheets assembled into Ni-Mo-Se micro-flowers is thinner than Ni-Mo-O (Fig. 1d). Such 3D hierarchical architecture can provide numerous active sites and thus shorten the ion transport path, resulting in a sufficient electrolyte–electrode interface for electrochemical reactions. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image demonstrates a lattice fringe spacing of 0.27 nm (Fig. 1e), which agrees with the distance of (101) planes of NiSe. Meanwhile, the MoSe2 phase with unique lattice fringe (0.7 nm) and layered structure can be also observed from the HRTEM image, consistent with the results of Raman spectrum. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) clearly shows that the Ni-Mo-Se micro-flower is mainly composed of Ni (20.9 at%), O (39.1 at%) and Se (33.2 at%) with a small amount of Mo (6.8 at%) (Fig. S1). And the EDS mapping images in Fig. 1(g-j) display the uniform distribution of Ni, Mo, and Se elements. 3.2 Characterization and analysis of anodized catalysts Electrochemical conversion was in-situ carried out by the anodic oxidation (AO) at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 12 h (Fig. S2 and S3). The XRD pattern of anodized Ni-Mo-Se/NF (Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO) indicates that the diffraction peaks of NiSe disappear (Fig. 2 a), although the micro-spheric morphology assembled from ultra-small nanosheets is well preserved, as indicated by the SEM image (Fig. S4). As a comparison, the corresponding XRD and SEM characterizations of the Ni-Mo-O/NF electrode after anodic oxidation (Ni-Mo-O/NF-AO) demonstrate unchanged crystalline phase and morphology with the starting material (Fig. 2a and e). The Raman spectrum of Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO in Fig. 2(b) exhibits two main peaks at 476 and 558 cm−1 which can be well assigned to the typical vibration peaks of γ-NiOOH [27,28]. In contrast, the Raman signal of Ni-Mo-O/NF-AO shows an intense peak at 938 cm−1 with some weak peaks appearing at 854, 803, and 348 cm−1, which can be attributed to the Ni-Mo-O stretching vibrations and similar to that of Ni-Mo-O/NF precatalyst (inset in Fig. 1f) [29,30]. This result means that further selenization of the Ni-Mo-O/NF electrode can promote reconstruction to form highly-active γ-NiOOH species during the anodic oxidation. The element content of Ni-Mo-O/NF, Ni-Mo-O/NF-AO, Ni-Mo-Se/NF, and Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO is determined by the inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). As shown in Fig. 2(c), the content of Mo in Ni-Mo-O/NF-AO is slightly lower than that in Ni-Mo-O/NF, suggesting the superficial reconstruction of Ni-Mo-O/NF in the anodic oxidation process. However, compared with Ni-Mo-Se/NF, the content of Mo and Se in Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO sharply decreases after 12 h anodic oxidation, which proves the complete reconstruction of Ni-Mo-Se/NF during the anodizing. Furthermore, the EDS of Ni-Mo-O/NF, Ni-Mo-O/NF-AO, Ni-Mo-Se/NF and Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO shows the similar results with ICP-OES (Figs. S5, S6 and S7). In order to further confirm this transformation, we also analyze the content of Mo, Se, and Ni in the electrolyte by ICP-OES. As shown in Fig. 2(d), no matter for Ni-Mo-O/NF-AO or Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO, the content of Ni in the electrolyte keeps at very low level. However, the concentration of Mo in Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO electrolyte increases obviously, which is much higher than that in Ni-Mo-O/NF-AO electrolyte. Additionally, the concentration of Se in Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO electrolyte increases sharply, reconfirming the severe leaching of Se during the anodic oxidation. TEM image reveals that the flower-like morphology of Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO is constituted by distorted and interconnected ultrathin nanosheets (Fig. 2f). From atomic force microscopy (AFM) height profiles of two random nanosheets, the thickness is measured to be ∼ 4.5 nm (Fig. S8), which corroborates their ultrathin nature. HRTEM image displays that the well-defined hybrid structure of NiSe/MoSe2 turns into a disordered structure. The locally distinguishable lattice fringes give a spacing of 0.21 nm, corresponding to the distance of (105) planes of γ-NiOOH (JCPDS card no. 6–75) (Fig. 2g). The FFT pattern shows barely discernible diffraction rings (inset in Fig. 2g), demonstrating the poor polycrystalline nature of the nanosheets. These results illustrate that the crystalline Ni-Mo-Se can be perfectly converted into ultrathin γ-NiOOH with low crystallinity via electrochemical oxidation, which can’t be achieved by the Ni-Mo-O. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is performed to give more information about the surface composition and valence states of Ni-Mo-Se/NF before and after 12 h electrochemical conversion. Based on the XPS in a wide-energy range (Fig. S9), the content of Ni, Mo, O, and Se in Ni-Mo-Se/NF is 2.07 at%, 29.25 at%, 23.85 at%, and 44.82 at%, respectively (Table S1). Compared with the results of EDS, the surface content of Mo is larger than the bulk, while the composition of Ni in bulk is significantly higher than that on the surface. In the high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum of the as-prepared Ni-Mo-Se/NF (Fig. 3 a), the peak centered at 852.6 eV corresponds to nickel selenide, suggesting that Ni exists in Ni2+ state [31]. And the peaks at 855.6 and 873.1 eV are attributed to nickel-oxygen species caused by the unavoidable surface oxidation [32]. After anodizing, the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 spectra display two prominent peaks at the binding energy of 856.0 and 873.6 eV, respectively, that are typical to the NiOOH phase reported in the literature [33], whereas the peak responsible for nickel selenide is absent, confirming the complete electrooxidation of Ni-Mo-Se surface to NiOOH. As for the Mo 3d spectrum of Ni-Mo-Se/NF (Fig. 3b), the signals located at 229.2 and 232.0 eV correspond to Mo4+ 3d5/2 and Mo4+ 3d3/2 of the 2H-MoSe2, respectively, while the presence of additional peaks at lower binding energies of 228.0 and 231.0 eV indicates the coexistence of the 1 T-MoSe2, consistent with the results of Raman spectrum [34]. The characteristic peaks of Se 3d at 54.4 and 53.5 eV belong to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 spectra of selenide, respectively (Fig. 3c) [35]. For the O 1 s spectrum of Ni-Mo-Se/NF (Fig. 3d), the peak at 532.2 eV can be attributed to the adsorbed water while the peak at a lower binding energy (530.7 eV) is usually assigned to Ni-OH [32]. After anodic oxidation, the peak centered at 531.0 eV is characteristic for the oxygen bonded to the species with higher valence (Ni3+), consistent with the Ni 2p spectra [36]. Additionally, it is worthy to point out that Mo and Se signals on the surface of Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO disappear entirely, which indicates the co-leaching of Mo and Se elements, in agreement with the results of EDS and ICP-OES. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) was further applied to investigate the compositional distribution and microelectronic environment of the restructured surface. The EELS elemental maps suggest the homogeneous distribution of Ni and O through the analyzed area in Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO (Fig. 3e). Moreover, EELS spectra collected at the six spots in Fig. 3(f) show that there is no detectable shift of the O K-edge and Ni L-edge EELS spectra within the restructured surface of Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO, which suggests a uniform electronic environment. However, compared with standard Ni L-edge EELS spectrum of NiO, it can be observed that the position of Ni L-edge shifts to higher energy losses, demonstrating that the valence state of Ni in Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO is higher than that of NiO (Ni2+). This trend is consistent with the surface-sensitive XPS results. FT-IR analysis was carried out to identify the surface functional groups and the types of bonding. As shown in Fig. 3(g), the band around 3400 cm−1 could be assigned to stretching vibrations of interlayer water molecules, and the peak at 1632 cm−1 is due to the angular deformation of water (δ(H-OH)) [37]. After 12 h electrochemical oxidation, the intensity of the band at 579 cm−1 which is resulted from Ni3+-O stretching vibrations of γ-NiOOH increases significantly [38]. Moreover, compared with Ni-Mo-Se/NF, new peaks at 1050 and 1382 cm−1 in Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO could be ascribed to the C-O (alkoxy) stretching vibrations and C-O stretching vibrations of CO3 2–, respectively [38,39]. As previously reported, such intercalation of carbonate anions between interlayers of γ-NiOOH is beneficial to enhance the OER activity [38]. 3.3 In situ capture of dynamic reconstruction processes Then we use potential-dependent in situ Raman spectroscopy to gain insights into the reconstruction process of Ni-Mo-Se/NF (Fig. 4 a). As the pristine Ni-Mo-Se/NF was immersed into 1 M KOH, the Raman spectrum under open circuit potential shows three weak peaks at ∼ 146, ∼220, and ∼ 284 cm−1, which can be assigned to the libration and/or stretching modes of Se-Se pairs. With the potential increasing, all the above peaks diminish, indicating the rapid structural decomposition of Ni-Mo-Se. When the oxidation potential reached 1.17 V (vs. RHE), two well-defined Raman peaks at ∼ 471 and ∼ 552 cm−1, ascribed to the E g bending vibration (δ(Ni-O)) and A1g stretching vibration (ν(Ni-O)), respectively, appear and become stronger with the increasing potential, suggesting the formation of γ-NiOOH phase with a higher intensity ratio of I δ/ν [40]. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the Raman peaks of γ-NiOOH are intact as the applied bias voltage is reduced back to 1.02 V (vs. RHE), which proves that γ-NiOOH serves as an OER-stable catalytic species. Contrary to Ni-Mo-Se/NF, Ni-Mo-O/NF shows unchanged Raman peaks under the same test conditions (Fig. 4b). The Raman signal of NiOOH is undetected because Ni-Mo-O is not reconstructed or the thickness of generated NiOOH is too thin. To visualize the dynamic reconstruction process, ex situ TEM and EDS were employed to clarify the microstructures of intermediates at different stages. According to the CP activation curve (Fig. S2), the typical reaction time was chosen as 0 h, 300 s, 1200 s, and 12 h. As shown in Fig. 4(c), the pristine Ni-Mo-Se micro-flower is very thick, only showing a thin layer at the edge. HRTEM image shows clear lattice fringes in large area, which can be assigned to the NiSe and MoSe2, indicating the highly crystalline nature of Ni-Mo-Se (Fig. 4d). After 300 s of reaction, the edge thickness of Ni-Mo-Se micro-flower is decreased obviously, and the exposed interplanar spacings of 0.27 and 0.7 nm can be identified as the (101) and (002) planes of NiSe and MoSe2, respectively (Fig. 4e and f). Notably, EDS analysis displays that the contents (at%) of Mo and Se decrease from initial 6.8% and 33.2% to 2.7% and 32.2%, respectively, demonstrating the obvious detachment of Mo (Fig. S10). After 1200 s of reaction, the area of nanosheet is further expanded along the radial direction (Fig. 4g). Meanwhile, only one orientation, which can be attributed to the NiSe phase, appears in the HRTEM image (Fig. 4h). The domains containing clear lattice fringes reduce sharply, while the low-crystalline regions are increased remarkably. EDS results reveal that the content of Se is further reduced to 14.3%, and the signal of Mo is undetected, suggesting that Mo has been entirely dissolved in the electrolyte (Fig. S11). Finally, after 12 h of reaction, the nanosheets become thinner and less crystalline (Fig. 4i and j). Meanwhile, the element of Se disappears completely as examined by the EDS (Fig. S7). Therefore, based on the above-mentioned results, it can be concluded that with co-leaching of Mo and Se during the anodic oxidation, the thick and highly crystalline Ni-Mo-Se micro-flower (about several micrometers) gradually decomposes and transforms into γ-NiOOH ultrathin nanosheet from the outside to the inside, and finally realizes the deep reconstruction (Fig. 4k). 3.4 Performance and discussion of electrocatalytic O2 evolution The electrocatalytic activity of Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO, Ni-Mo-O/NF, Ni-Mo-O/NF-AO, and NF towards OER in Fe-free 1 M KOH electrolyte was measured and compared by linear scan voltammetry (LSV). As shown in Fig. 5 (a), Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO exhibits the overwhelming superiority, giving much higher current density (J) at the same overpotential (η). To reach J = 10 mA cm−2, Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO required an overpotential of only 244 mV, which was 120, 94 and 250 mV less than that of Ni-Mo-O/NF, Ni-Mo-O/NF-AO and NF, respectively. Such remarkable OER activity outperforms almost all the Fe-free NiOOH-based electrocatalysts (Fig. 5c and Table S2). Moreover, calculated by the corresponding LSV polarization curves, Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO exhibits the lowest Tafel slope of 44.8 mV dec-1 compared to Ni-Mo-O/NF (101.7 mV dec-1), Ni-Mo-O/NF-AO (59.9 mV dec-1) and NF (188.5 mV dec-1), suggesting the most favorable kinetics for oxygen evolution (Fig. 5b). The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is estimated by the double-layer capacitance (C dl) via cyclic voltammetry curves in the double-layer region at different scan rates (Fig. S12). The calculated C dl of Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO (4.0 mF cm−2) is smaller than that of Ni-Mo-O/NF (11.0 mF cm−2) and Ni-Mo-O/NF-AO electrode (14.8 mF cm−2) (Fig. 5d). Accordingly, the OER current densities normalized by ECSA show that Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO still greatly outperforms Ni-Mo-O/NF and Ni-Mo-O/NF-AO (Fig. 5e), indicating the excellent intrinsic activity of Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test was conducted to further investigate the electrode kinetics of Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO and Ni-Mo-O/NF-AO during OER process (Fig. 5f). Subsequently, we used an equivalent circuit model consisting of solution resistance (Rs) in series with two-time constant serial model to simulate the EIS data (inset in Fig. 5f). It has been postulated that the first section of serial model containing catalyst inner-layer/interface resistance (Rin) and constant phase element (CPE1) corresponds to the circuit of catalyst inner layer, while the second time constant (Rct-CPE2) is related to the charge transfer process at electrolyte-catalyst interface [41,42]. Obviously, Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO provides a much smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct = 0.36 Ω, Table S3) than that of Ni-Mo-O/NF-AO (Rct = 32.9 Ω, Table S3), indicating the in-situ developed γ-NiOOH can accelerate the charge transfer in the OER process. Besides high catalytic activity, we also performed chronopotentiometric measurement at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 to evaluate the durability of Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO. The overpotential did not increase after 30 h test (Fig. 5g), and the LSV curve after CP test almost overlaps with the initial one (inset in Fig. 5g). Moreover, after OER durability test, the hierarchical structure of Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO assembled by ultrathin nanosheets and the poor crystallinity of the derived γ-NiOOH are well maintained (Fig. 5h and S13). The typical peaks of γ-NiOOH in Raman spectrum are clearly visible (Fig. 5i). Additionally, compared with that in the electrolyte after 12 h anodic oxidation, the concentrations of Mo and Se in the electrolyte after 30 h stability test are ignorable (Table S4). All the above results demonstrate the excellent stability of Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO electrode. Based on the aforementioned results and analysis, the superior OER performance of Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO may arise from the following reasons: (1) It is widely accepted that the highly oxidized Ni4+ species exists in γ-NiOOH due to the statistic Ni valency of + 3.6 [43]. The existence of Ni4+ can shift the Fermi level down to expose hole states for catalysis, thus offering higher intrinsic OER activity [44]. Most importantly, γ-NiOOH has a large interlayer spacing of ∼ 7 Å containing many intercalated species such as H2O, OH– or CO3 2–, which is favorable to expose more active sites for the evolution of oxygen [36]. (2) The 3D hierarchical flower-like structure assembled by crossed ultrathin nanosheets can provide rich electrode/electrolyte interfaces, weaken the concentration polarization, and further ensure the rapid transport of OH– during the electrochemical process. Meanwhile, the ultrathin nanosheets and low crystallinity induce abundant surface defects and coordinatively unsaturated sites, which contributes more active edge sites with boosted intrinsic activity. (3) The intense conjugation between γ-NiOOH micro-flowers and the porous NF support would not only enhance the electrochemical stability but also promote the charge transfer and rapid release of evolved gas. Owing to the synergistic advantages of the above factors, the Ni-Mo-Se/NF-AO electrode exhibits a superior OER performance. 4 Conclusions We have successfully synthesized a unique 3D hierarchical Ni-Mo-Se micro-flowers with nanosheets as building units. Through in-situ Raman spectroscopy and ex-situ approaches (XRD, HRTEM, and EDS), it is demonstrated that Ni-Mo-Se micro-flowers are a precatalyst for OER and can be deeply reconstructed into highly-active γ-NiOOH during anodizing, which acts as the catalytic species to facilitate O2 evolution. The dissolution of Mo and Se confirms their insignificant functional role for OER, but it is essential to direct the morphology and reconstruction process to form the most active catalyst. The derived γ-NiOOH micro-flowers assembled by crossed ultrathin nanosheets (thickness: ∼4.5 nm) can maximize the number of active sites and thus exhibits excellent OER activity in the Fe-free alkaline electrolyte with a small overpotential of 244 mV at 10 mA cm−2, which can compete with the state-of-the-art NiFe-based OER catalysts. This work not only provides a new insight in understanding the structure evolution during anodic oxidation, but also paves a new avenue for the development of cost-effective and efficient OER electrocatalysts.

        "dc:description": "Transition metal chalcogenides will be in situ transformed into metal oxyhydroxides during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process in alkaline medium. However, most of these compounds only undergo surface reconstruction under operating conditions, which contains a large percentage of inactive atoms in the core, thus limiting the exposure of the active sites. Here, we synthesize a Ni-Mo-Se precatalyst with three-dimensional hierarchical structure and develop a facile on-site electrochemical activation strategy for achieving deep reconstruction of the precatalyst. Using the combination of multiple spectroscopic characterizations and high resolution electron microscopy techniques, we unravel that the Ni-Mo-Se precatalyst is deeply reconstructed into γ-NiOOH with co-leaching of Mo and Se after the anodic oxidation. Such flower-like γ-NiOOH is constituted by distorted ultrathin nanosheets with a thickness of ∼ 4.5 nm and contains abundant intercalated species such as water and OH–/CO3 2–, thus offering a large quantity of accessible active sites. To reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2, the derived electrode requires an overpotential of only 244 mV, outperforming almost all the reported analogues. This work highlights the reconstruction chemistry and provides a simple method for the preparation of efficient OER electrocatalyst.",
