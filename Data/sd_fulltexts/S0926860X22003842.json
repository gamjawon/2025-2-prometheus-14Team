NanoElectrochemistry Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Taipei 10607 Taiwan The application of single-atom catalysts (SACs) receives excellent attention in producing fine chemicals. SACs demonstrate higher activity, selectivity, stability and are more economical. Herein we designed and successfully synthesized an electrochemical catalyst consisting of Pt single atoms on titanium oxide support (PtSAC/TiO2) via hydrothermal assisted co-precipitation method, which is simple, fast, and efficient. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and FT- EXAFS spectra disclose that Pt atoms are well dispersed and show no Pt–Pt coordination. We are the first to apply SACs for partial oxidation of Ethylene glycol (EGO) using PtSAC/TiO2. The strong metal support interaction (SMSI) between Pt and TiO2 and the availability of identical Pt active sites enhanced catalytic selectivity of PtSAC/TiO2. These help EG oxidation on PtSAC/TiO2 to produce glycolate and formate selectively. The higher surface contacts between PtSAC and EG lead to an improved catalytic performance towards EGO. Our stability tests demonstrated that PtSAC/TiO2 showed a slower current decay rate and higher oxidation current density, thus providing better electrocatalytic activity and stability. Hence, PtSAC/TiO2 led to higher reactivity and provided a higher current density response. The as-synthesized PtSAC/TiO2 catalyst exhibits an excellent Faradaic efficiency of 99.7 % and remarkable stability, with a very minimal current drop within 12 h in an alkaline solution.

They are widely used to speed up chemical reactions by minimizing activation energy and changing the reaction pathways. Noble metal catalysts such as Pt and Pd are commonly used for their unique inherent behaviors in many catalytic applications. These include high resistance to chemical attack, high mechanical strength, stable electrical properties, and better catalytic activities [1,2]. Among the low molecular weight alcohols, ethylene glycol (EG) has gained much consideration very recently due to its properties. EG is sustainable and has a high energy density with lower flammability and permeability through membranes [3,4]. EG is one of the safe and ideal alternative fuels for direct alcohol fuel cells and can be used as a raw material to produce valuable chemicals. Electrochemical oxidation of EG to valuable products can occur either in acidic or alkaline media. Generally alkaline media is preferable over acidic media for oxidation of small alcohols due to the fast kinetics, minor catalyst corrosion, ease of formation of hydroxide adsorbed species, the high current generation, and minimal rate of alcohol permeation. However, in acidic electrolytes there is slow oxidation kinetics and difficulty of C-C bond breaking of EG. These make the complete oxidation of EG to H2O and CO2 difficult and complex. The partial oxidation of EG can be advantageous because it offers valuable intermediate products such as formate and glycolate. These products can further be used in other industries like medicine, pesticides, and organic synthesis [5,6]. Glycolate (CH2OHCOO−) and formate are the possible products from the EGO. Both glycolate and formate in sodium salt are used in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and personal care product industries. For example, glycolate in sodium glycolate is used as a common disintegrant in pharmaceuticals in tablets and capsules because sodium glycolate absorbs water rapidly and makes the disintegration of tablets and granules easy. They are also used in leather tanning or the dyeing and printing of textile fabrics. They can be used as a flavoring, preservative, additives, and/or antibacterial agent in food processing. Also, they are used as buffering agents during solution preparations to adjust the pH. Formate has attracted increasing attention because it can be used as a liquid fuel for direct format fuel cells, and its salts can be easily handled. It is also used as a de-icing and buffering agent in chromatographic analyses, such as liquid chromatography [7]. The production of two valuable products- glycolate and formate, from EGO could be considered an economically important process, but the design of a suitable catalyst will be strategically important to manage the reactions. EG as a raw material for production of formate and glycolate can be cheaply obtained from decomposition of biomasses. The products glycolate and formate can be directly used for various applications or can be used as inputs for other industries like medicine, pesticides, and organic synthesis. Na or K salts of formate and glycolate could be used in areas like pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food processing, and leather and textile industries. Though it is possible to produce these economically important products from electrochemical oxidation of EG, obtaining suitable electrocatalysts especially single atom catalysts (SACs) is usually challenging. By nature, SACs have greater tendency to sinter and aggregate during catalysis. So a careful design and synthesis of appropriate catalysts on a suitable catalyst support is needed to undertake an efficient electrochemical oxidation of EG. An appropriate support is important to hold the catalysts in a well dispersed and stable manner. The demand and applications of catalysts in the majority of industries and research institutes are highly increasing. On decreasing the size of catalysts, the exposure of reactive sites to substrates increases; hence, activity increases. In this regard, single-atom catalysts (SACs) are preferable because SACs have isolated active sites dispersed on support, demonstrating a unique electronic structure and coordination environment. SACs significantly increase the number of active sites and reduce the consumption of precious metals [8–10]. SACs maximize the atomic efficiency of metals and provide an alternative strategy to tune the activity and selectivity of reactions. The homogeneity in the active sites and geometric structure of SACs gives them the great capability to enhance catalyst selectivity [11]. The main reasons for the low electrocatalyst durability are the loss of electrochemical surface area due to corrosion and/or agglomeration of nanosized catalysts. If the Pt active sites are poisoned by intermediate products such as CO, there will exist an adverse effect on the catalysts’ performances [12–14]. Detachment from the support also results in noticeable activity decay. Though SACs have attracted great attention due to their high atomic utilization and catalytic efficiency, single-atom catalysts such as Pt single-atom catalysts tend to sinter and aggregate during the catalytic reaction, decreasing performance due to their high surface energy. The strength of the metal-support interaction (MSI) between a catalyst and its support plays an important role in enhancing the stability of single atoms. SACs strongly anchored to their support demonstrate high stability and high electrochemical performances, whereas those SACs which are weakly anchored to their support are highly susceptible to leaching by electrolytes. Hence their electrochemical performances decrease [15–17]. Suitable supports show uniform catalyst dispersion and effective and strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) in SACs [18]. Carbon-based supports usually corrode, leading to failure and clustering of SACs to nanoparticles and thus the loss of catalytic activity. The use of non-carbon-based supports can thus avoid this failure. In such cases, the strong interaction between metal catalyst and oxide groups of the support effectively prevents agglomeration and leaching of catalysts [19,20]. Among the promising metal oxide supports, TiO2 has high corrosion resistance, affordable price, superior electrochemical stability, and SMSI with the catalyst [21]. In this work we preferred TiO2 to carbon based supports. This is mainly to avoid or minimize the risk of CO poisoning as Pt is susceptible to CO poisoning from carbon based supports. Moreover, its high activity in various redox reactions at low pressure and temperatures, high metal-support interaction, high chemical stability, and acid-base properties make TiO2 preferable support than carbon based supports. In the case of alkaline electrolytes, the OH− present in the electrolyte and the OH- adsorption can highly facilitate the de-protonation of alcohols and enhance the oxidation of the poisonous CO intermediates into CO2 [22]. Alkaline electrolytes suffer from electrolyte carbonation but benefit from higher current efficiency, more choices for electrode materials, and little sensitivity of the anodic reaction to the surface structure [23,24]. EGO has faster kinetics in an alkaline medium, and there is progressive carbonation due to CO2 resulting in a decrease in the pH, leading to lower reactivity [25]. EG oxidation in an alkaline medium can produce either 2 C- or 1 C -containing species or the mixture. To cleave the strong C-C bond of EG and study the quantitative analysis of intermediate products of EGO, Pt/C, Pt-Ru/C, and Pt-Ni/C were synthesized and used in alkaline solutions [26]. On the other hand, CO may also be identified as adsorbate COad which poisons Pt-based catalysts. These carbon-supported catalysts are susceptible to corrosion. Moreover, large Pt-based catalysts are not economical. Hence, we need to find an appropriate electrocatalyst that best fits our EGO catalysis. As far as our information is concerned, oxide-supported Pt single-atom catalysts have not been used in the electro oxidation of EG. In this work, we successfully designed and synthesized efficient, durable, and cost-effective PtSAC anchored on TiO2 support through hydrothermal assisted co-precipitation method and was applied for partial oxidation of EG for the first time under alkaline medium to produce valuable chemicals. This helps us exploit the novel properties emerging from SACs and tailor the catalyst-support for preferred reaction pathways and product selectivity. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Synthesis of PtSAC/TiO2 catalysts All materials were analytical grade reagents and used as received. Hexachloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl60.6 H2O, (37 % Pt)), titanium tetrachloride, TiCl4 (>99 % pure), urea, CO (NH2)2 (99.5 % pure), NaOH pellets (99.99 % pure), Ethylene glycol, C2H6O2 (99.9 % pure), isopropanol alcohol, IPA, (CH3CHOHCH3), ECP300 carbon black, Nafion solution (5 % in ethanol). Pt/C (20 wt % Pt) used in this work was also obtained commercially from the market. The hydrothermal assisted co-precipitation method was used to synthesize both PtSAC/TiO2 and PtNP/TiO2 catalysts. This method was preferred because co-precipitation is simple, rapid, and economical for the synthesis of SACs [27]. The synthesis consists of mixing TiCl4, H2PtCl6·6H2O (37 % Pt), and urea (CO (NH2)2) solutions, which were all dissolved in the aqueous phase. The Pt precursor was dispersed in the solvent containing TiCl4. In synthesizing PtSAC/TiO2, we controlled the Pt loading onto TiO2 by applying diluted H2PtCl6·6H2O as Pt precursor to effectively disperse and anchor Pt single atoms. PtNP/TiO2 was prepared using the same procedure as PtSAC/TiO2, but a larger volume of Pt precursor was used. About 26.5 μL and 265 μL Pt precursor was used for the PtSAC/TiO2 and PtNP/TiO2 synthesis. The detailed synthesis procedure has shown in the supporting information. 2.2 Characterizations Catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability are the key concepts that our characterizations were mainly focusing on. These three are the determinants to check the suitability of a catalyst for a given reaction. The physical and electrochemical properties of our catalysts were evaluated using different techniques. D2 Phaser XRD-300 W diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation of 1.5406 Å with a beam source operated at 30 kV, and 10 mA was used to record the structural information. The diffraction patterns were picked up in the range 2θ = 20 − 80° with a 10° per minute scanning rate. A Raman spectrometer (UniDron) at a wavelength of 532 nm Laser, 0.3 mW laser power with exposition time of 3 s and the number of accumulations of 20 was applied between 100 and 800 cm−1. To confirm the formation of PtSAC/TiO2, HAADF-STEM, and XAS was employed in National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (beamline station 44 A, NSRRC), Hsinchu, Taiwan. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were employed to estimate the BET surface area. The ICP-OES was performed to determine the actual loading. The electrochemical measurements were performed to test the catalytic performance. The Bruker AV 600 MHz NMR and gas chromatograph (ACME6100, Vastech) were used to identify EGO products. 2.3 Electrochemical test The catalytic activity of our catalysts was done using an argon-saturated 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte containing 0.5 M EG solution at 50 mV/s scan rate, and 25 ◦ C. Chronoamperometric method was employed to investigate their stability. In the process, 0.04 mg Pt/cm2 was used for the activity test and 0.1 mg Pt/cm2 for the stability test at 0.9 V. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD, Raman, and BET surface area The structural phases for PtSAC/TiO2 were determined by XRD measurements and the peaks correspond to the anatase phase, matching well to PDF Card No: 75–1537 ( Fig. 1 a). The sharp peaks observed in the XRD patterns of all the synthesized materials are attributed to the anatase phase of TiO2 nanoparticles as it is confirmed by reference PDF card. These XRD patterns of the synthesized Pt catalysts show no Pt peaks. near 2θ of 40, 47, and 67 degrees. No new diffraction peaks appeared as compared to the bare TiO2, sample indicating Pt in PtSAC/TiO2 does not form a crystalline structure. This preliminary confirms that the synthesized catalysts contain no Pt nanoparticles. This might be an indication that Pt is totally absent or highly dispersed on TiO2 support as a single atom. The average grain size was evaluated from the diffraction peak using the Debye-Scherer equation (d = kλ / (β cos θ max) at a wavelength (λ) monochromatic Cu radiation of (ca. 0.154 nm), with Bragg angle θ measured at the position of TiO2 maximum peaks and β is the width (in radians) of the diffraction peak at a half-height. The coefficient k is generally taken as 0.9. Based on this calculation, the average grain size of TiO2 was found to be 6.74 nm. The same phenomenon also happened to the PtNP/TiO2 sample which has a higher Pt composition as compared with PtSAC/TiO2. The amount of Pt PtNP/TiO2 maybe not be enough to be detected by the XRD machine [28]. However, the nanoparticle nature of the PtNP/TiO2 sample was confirmed by other characterization techniques. The BET surface area (Fig. 1 b and Fig. S3 - SI.) was obtained from the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm at 77 K. Before the measurements. The catalysts were degassed at 300 °C for 2 h under vacuum conditions to remove water molecules adsorbed on the samples’ surfaces. On this measurement, the BET surface area of PtSAC/TiO2 was about 204 m2/g and 178 m2/g for PtNP/TiO2. This high BET surface area was quite beneficial for better dispersion of Pt atoms on the surface than in the case of PtNP/TiO2. Generally, higher BET results show that the high surface area of catalyst supports provides sufficient space for improved dispersion of Pt catalysts. The Raman spectroscopy was used to confirm the structure of TiO2 (anatase, brookite, or rutile) in the prepared TiO2, PtNP/TiO2, and PtNP/TiO2 catalysts. The peaks of Raman scattering spectroscopy are highly specific and chemical fingerprints of materials. An intense peak near 640 cm−1 is one of the Raman characteristics of anatase TiO2 [29]. In the spectra of TiO2 and PtSAC/TiO2 (Fig. 1 c), the Raman spectra of TiO2 disclose peaks at 398, 516, and 639 cm−1. These bands can be attributed to Raman active modes of the anatase phase, confirming that we successfully synthesized anatase-type TiO2. The Raman spectrum of our PtSAC/TiO2 nearly coincides with that of pure TiO2. The peaks appeared almost at the same positions as that of pure TiO2. The intensity of the major TiO2 Raman peak near 143 cm−1 highly decreased with increasing Pt content in the order TiO2 > PtSAC/TiO2 > PtNP/TiO2. (Fig. 1 c and Fig. S4- SI). The decreasing in peak intensity shows the successful loading of Pt atoms on to TiO2 support. In the synthesis process both the Pt catalyst and the support TiO2 co- precipitate together in which the Pt is surrounded by the Ti-O-Ti bonds as the composition of Ti is much higher than Pt. However, up on hydrogen treatment, these bonds surrounding the Pt atoms burst and cause Pt atoms to come out from the inside of TiO2 to the surface. All the results of the samples mentioned in this manuscript are hydrogen treated. 3.2 STEM and XAS analysis for verification of single-atom dispersion The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) is the most significant and direct approach to assure the existence of isolated single metal atoms and determine the spatial distribution [30]. HAADF-STEM images ( Fig. 2 a) confirmed the presence of Pt atoms (yellow encircled white spots) on the support in a highly dispersed manner. In contrast, the STEM image (Fig. S5 - SI) has demonstrated that the Pt particles of PtNP/TiO2 are agglomerated on the TiO2 support. The elemental composition analysis, shown by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of (Fig. 2 b-f and Fig. S3 - SI), reveals the presence of Pt peaks in our sample (PtSAC/ TiO2) along with Ti and O, which confirms the effective loading of Pt on TiO2. The EDS results reveal that Pt atoms are uniformly distributed on the TiO2 surface, suggesting that the PtSAC was effectively synthesized by the simple hydrothermal assisted co-precipitation method. These images (Figs. 2 b- 2 f) also clearly show the catalyst's elemental distribution (Pt, Ti, and O). XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) analysis was performed to determine the oxidation state of Pt in Pt/TiO2. In Pt 4 f ( Fig. 3 a), the two sets of peaks at binding energies (BEs) (72.22 and 76.33) and (74.97 and 79.72 eV) are assigned to the 4 f peaks of Pt2+ (PtO) and Pt4+ (PtO2), respectively. Thus, for PtSAC/TiO2, Pt exists as Pt4+ and Pt2+, where Pt4+ is the dominant oxidation state [31,32]. During the synthesis process, Pt in PtSAC/TiO2 might be in + 4 oxidation state, but after H2 treatment, the oxidation state of Pt could be reduced from + 4 to + 2, agreeing with the XANES spectra of PtSAC/TiO2. This is further evidenced from FT-EXAFS data showing that, Pt is still coordinated with surface oxygen of TiO2. XANES was employed at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Centre (NSRRC), Taiwan, to obtain detailed information about the dispersion of single atoms, the nature of the neighboring atomic species, and oxidation states of our catalyst. The normalized XANES measurement spectra for the Pt-L3 edge in the PtSAC/ TiO2 and PtNP/ TiO2 catalysts confirmed that our PtSAC/TiO2 has a positive charge in which the white line, WL (an intense absorption in the near-edge), gives a quantitative indication of the oxidation state of Pt. The XANES spectra (Fig. 3b), shows white line peaks at about 11,568.6 eV (PtSAC/TiO2), 11,568 eV (PtO2) and 11,567 eV (PtNP/TiO2 and Pt foil) in the white-line intensity order PtO2 > PtSAC/TiO2 > PtNP/TiO2 > Pt foil. This indicates that the oxidation state of Pt in our synthesized catalysts lies between zero and four. The high intensity of XANES spectra in our PtSAC/TiO2 compared to PtNP/TiO2 and Pt foil indicates the occurrence of more vacant d orbitals at Pt of the PtSAC resulting from the electron transfer from Pt atoms to TiO2 surface. This would be responsible both for the strong binding and stabilization of PtSAC. This electron transfer also provides positively charged Pt atoms, which ultimately account for the excellent catalytic activity of the PtSAC/TiO2 catalyst. Fourier-transformed extended X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (FT-EXAFS) analysis at Pt L3-edge was employed. The FT-EXAFS analysis at Pt L3-edge no intense peak at about 2.76 Å for PtSAC/ TiO2. This further confirmed the absence of Pt–Pt coordination; and the high atomic dispersion of Pt single atoms on TiO2. The intense peak centered at 2.76 Å represents the contribution of the first metal-metal coordination shell to the EXAFS oscillations of the PtNP/ TiO2 and Pt foil [33,34]. Pt foil and PtNP/TiO2 show almost identical peak positions in the spectra. This similarity indicates that they are in the same coordination environment. As shown in the EXAFS data, these two materials show metal-metal (Pt-Pt) coordination. (Fig. 3 c). Pt in our PtSAC/ TiO2 catalyst existed entirely as isolated single atoms. Unlike PtNP/TiO2 and Pt foil, PtSAC/TiO2 displayed an intense peak at about 1.5 Å. This is assignable to a Pt-O bond of PtSAC/TiO2 with a bond length of 1.99 Å (Table1). Pt nanoparticles or Pt foils show intense peaks near 2 Å. The presence of Pt–O coordination confirmed that Pt in PtSAC/TiO2 is coordinated with the electrophilic oxygen atoms in TiO2, which agrees with the positive valence state of Pt shown by XANES analysis. The EXAFS curve for single atoms shows a strong first-shell metal-support peak, similar to the M–O peak (M= metals) for metal oxide, as no metal-metal bond is present [35–37]. The quantitative coordination configuration of the synthesized Pt catalysts and Pt foil was further investigated by EXAFS curve fitting. The best-fitting parameters extracted from the FT-EXAFS spectra (Fig. S8 - SI) summarized in Table 1 show that the coordination number of Pt–O is 3.5 ± 0.6 and 1.1 ± 0.4 for PtSAC/TiO2 and PtNP/TiO2, respectively. The overall results of STEM, XANES, and FT-EXAFS revealed that the synthesized PtSAC/TiO2 is composed of Pt atoms coordinated with O atoms from TiO2. The well-defined Pt–O coordination indicates uniformity in the local coordination of the Pt single atom structure, which is very helpful for enhanced catalytic performances. The backscattering of PtNP/TiO2 shown in the EXAFS data (Fig. 3 c) is very weak. As a result of this Pt-Ti bonding is not clearly seen. 3.3 Electrochemical performance analysis The electrochemical performance measurements were conducted in a conventional three-electrode system connected to a potentiostat. The system employed a single cell reactor in which carbon paper (geometrical area 1 cm2), RHE, and graphite carbon rod were used as working, reference, and counter electrodes. In all these measurements, 0.1 M NaOH containing 0.5 M EG solution was used with a scan rate of 50 mV/s at 25 ◦ C. All the measurements were done along with a blank solution analysis (0.1 M NaOH without ethylene glycol). The data were recorded and analyzed after background current correction was made on each current response. A loading of 0.04 mg Pt/cm2 was used for activity test, and 0.1 mg Pt/cm2 for stability test at 0.9 V. Moreover, in order to check the effect of catalyst loading in the charge – discharge layer, a lower Pt loading (0.02 mg Pt/cm2) was investigated. The CV curve using lower loading of Pt (Fig. S12 - SI) has shown no obvious electric double layer charge-discharge current for PtSAC/TiO2. The oxidation peaks for PtSAC/TiO2 and PtNP/TiO2 observed in the forward scans ( Fig. 4 a) correspond to the oxidation of freshly chemisorbed species from EG adsorption. In contrast, the next oxidation peak in the backward scan is ascribed to further oxidation of the newly produced intermediates, probably from glycolate to formate [38]. During the forward scan, there is a gradual increase in current density starting from onset potential, and it continues increasing till the peak current density and peak potential are reached. Anodic current increases gradually with increasing applied potential; and drops back afterward. This situation is more pronounced in the case of single-atom catalysts. In the CV (Fig. 4 a) the onset potential of EGO for PtNP/TiO2 is lower than PtSAC/TiO2. This indicates that the oxidation of ethylene glycol on PtNP/TiO2 started earlier than PtSAC/TiO2. The large number of Pt in PtNP/TiO2 having extended sites have higher chance of contacting reacting species earlier than the isolated PtSACs. This might be the reason why PtNP/TiO2 show lower onset potential than the PtSAC/TiO2. In the CV curve of PtSAC/TiO2, the forward anodic peaks around 0.9 V are due to EGO, and oxidation peaks at about 0.77 V in the backward scan can be ascribed to the oxidations of adsorbed intermediate products. Catalyst intermediate compounds adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst, such as Pt–COads, could significantly decrease the performance of the catalyst during EGO. During the backward scan, adsorbed species can be oxidized by TiO2-OHads within the potential range where the backward anodic peak develops. This indicates that TiO2 enhances the reaction kinetics. Different researches demonstrated that, the ratio of the forward oxidation peaks current density to that of the backward oxidation peak current density (Jf/Jb) are used to evaluate the tolerance of catalysts to accumulated carbonaceous intermediates generated during oxidation of small alcohols on the electrode surface. If we evaluate the activities of catalysts based on this ratio, the one with a higher indicates less catalyst surface contamination. Such catalysts can undergo further oxidation of the alcohols or the intermediate products leading to improved catalytic performance [39–42]. In this specific work, the higher the ratio of Jf/Jb, the better the oxidation efficiency of EG and its intermediate EGO products, the lesser accumulation of catalyst poisoning species such as CO or CO-like matter, thus leading to better corrosion tolerance. The reverse outcomes occur when Jf/Jb gets lower and lower. The Jf/Jb ratio in Table 2 for PtSAC/TiO2 (8.52) and PtNP/TiO2 (2.82) are larger than that for Pt/C (1.61), which suggests that the support of TiO2 catalyst leads to complete EGO and less accumulation of CO-like species than that of carbon. This indicates that the as-prepared PtSAC/TiO2 is the more active towards EGO. The excellent distribution of Pt single atoms on the support helps achieve the strong metal-support interaction between Pt and TiO2 support. This implies that PtSACs/TiO2 catalyst is more CO-poisoning tolerant and could exhibit superior electrochemical stability. To investigate EG’s partial oxidation product distribution, we use 1H NMR for liquid product analysis and gas chromatograph for gaseous products. EGO on PtSAC/TiO2 produced glycolate, formate and hydrogen. PtNP/TiO2 on the other hand didn’t produce hydrogen during EGO. This might be due to the low exposure of active sites of PtNP towards to EG or the intermediate products. K. Miyazaki et al.2011did electrochemical oxidation of EGO on nano scale Pt-based electrocatalysts in alkaline medias. This group showed that formate and glycolate were the products obtained [28]. Here in this work too both products are obtained during EGO by using PtSAC/TiO2 and PtNP/TiO2. However, PtSAC/TiO2 has shown higher faradaic efficiency, FE than that of PtNP/TiO2. The selectivity of the products by PtSAC/TiO2 and PtNP/TiO2 at various potentials are summarized in Fig. 4 b. It is interesting to note that the faradaic efficiency of PtSAC/TiO2 has its maximum value of 99.7 % at 0.7 V vs RHE and the values slightly decreases with increasing applied voltages. In contrast, the faradaic efficiency of PtNP/TiO2 increases from 50.7 % at 0.7 V vs. RHE to 78.2 % at 1.0 V RHE. Furthermore, the product selectivity of both electrocatalysts are different, whereby PtSAC/TiO2 has relatively similar glycolate selectivity but slightly decreasing formate selectivity as the applied potential increases. On the other hand, PtNP/TiO2 seems to have more preference for glycolate when the applied potential increases, while the selectivity for formate seems to remain fairly constant. Uniform dispersion of Pt active sites on TiO2 makes the interaction between EG and Pt active sites identical. Glycolate (CH2OHCOO−), one of the liquid intermediate products of EGO, is obtained via 4 -electron oxidation of EG (Eq. 1), in which the C–C bond remains uncleaved. Formate, another liquid product of EGO, is generated via 6-electron oxidation, in which the C–C bond of EG is broken (Eqs. 2 or 2*). During EGO using Pt catalysts, the C-C bond cleavage of EG by the applied potential starts at about 0.5 V. This cleavage causes formate to be produced [43]. Apart from these liquid products, a very small quantity of hydrogen was detected as a gaseous product (Fig. 4 b). This could probably be from the decomposition of formate into CO2 and H2 (Eq. 4). The decarboxylation of formate can explain this. The balanced reaction equations for EG conversion to glycolate and formate can be expressed as Eqs. (1) and (2). (1) (CH2OH)2 + 5OH− → CH2OHCOO− + 4 H2O + 4e− (2) (CH2OH) 2 + 8OH− → 2HCOO− + 6 H2O + 6e− (2*) Or CH2OHCOO− + 3OH− → 2HCOO− + 2 H2O + 2e− (3) C2H3O3 - + 6OH- → HCOO- + CO3 2- + 4 H2O + 4e− (4) 2HCOO- + 2OH- → 2HCO3 - + H2 (g) + 2e− In our case, PtSAC/TiO2 shows preference towards oxidation of one OH- group of EG and proceeds the reaction stepwise producing glycolate, formate, and hydrogen. It is interesting to note that glycolaldehyde (CHOCH2OH), a common C2 intermediate product, was not detected, and this could be caused by its quick conversion into glycolate (C2H3O3 -) and formate (HCOO-). The high production of formate while using PtSAC/TiO2 could result from the oxidation of the newly coming EG (Eq. 2) or further glycolate oxidation (Eq. 2*). The decrease in FE on PtSAC/TiO2 could be due to progressive carbonation. CO2 in alkaline solution can turn progressively into carbonate and bicarbonate, and the catalytic performance of catalysts would gradually decay. (Eq. 3 and Eq.4) [44], [6]. The formate in the sample solution could exist as NaCOOH. It further oxidized to H2 and NaHCO3 on PtSAC/TiO2 catalyst via the process called dehydrogenation or decarboxylation. On a complete EGO reaction CO2 and H2O are produced, but because of its soluble nature in alkaline electrolytes the CO2 produced was not detected in both gas and liquid product analyses. It remained in the solution. This could be the most probable reason for the low FE of observed in PtNP/TiO2. In general, it is also important to note that progressive carbonation lowers the pH of a solution and affects the kinetics of EGO, leading to lower reactivity. The poisoning of the electrode surface by some adsorbed species can also affect the FE. We examined the stability of our catalysts by the chronoamperometric (CA) method in combination with the cyclic voltammetric technique (CV) in an alkaline medium. Here the CV analysis on both catalysts before and after stability tests was to compare the current density drops after stability. The testing was carried out using 0.1 mg Pt/cm2 of the catalysts in 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte containing 0.5 M solution of EG at a fixed potential of 0.9 V vs. RHE for 12 h and compared with that of PtNP/TiO2. The current response from chronoamperometry curves (i vs.t) of EGO on PtSAC/TiO2 and PtNP/TiO2 are shown in the insets of Fig. 4 c and Fig. 4 d. The chronoamperograms gradually decreased and attained a pseudo-steady state after the rapid initial current decay, which might be due to the deactivation of the catalytic sites of Pt arising from the adsorbed poisoning species during EGO. Then the curve lasts longer without significant degradation in current. Because of the high applied potential (0.9 V), electrochemically-active species in the chronoamperometric (CA) analysis diffuse to the surface of the working electrode. This time the electrode surface gives rise to a capacitive current, which decays rapidly at the start of a potential step. The rapid decay continuous until the CA system get stabilized. The intermediate poisoning species formed during alcohol oxidation could be considered as the main factor for decreasing the current density [2]. Besides some interfering ionic species or noises in the CA system could also be the cause for the observed current at the beginning of CA process. However, with decreasing the concentration of the reacting species the decay of current generated from EGO would take place gradually until the pseudo-steady state condition is achieved. The current density response of the CV curve of PtSAC/TiO2 (Fig. 4 c) shows a lesser decay of current density than PtNP/TiO2 (Fig. 4 d), confirming the better stability of our PtSAC/TiO2, which has a higher initial current and a slower decay rate than the PtNP/TiO2. The CV curves of PtNP/TiO2 on the stability test (Fig. 4 d) show current density values below 0 at lower potential ranges (0.05–0.4 V). This phenomenon might be resulted due to the adsorption of much ethylene glycol on the catalyst surface as EG do not oxidize in this potential region [45]. The PtSAC/TiO2 maintained a higher oxidation current density, thus providing better electrocatalytic activity and stability. In this wider potential window (0.05 – 1.2 V), EG and some intermediate products in the system could be further oxidized. As a result of this, high current is generated as compared to that of CA. The high coincidence of CV curves before and after the stability tests (Fig. 4 c) indicates the high stability of the PtSAC/TiO2 towards EGO and its ability to undertake further oxidations. The GC analysis has shown that the level of CO in the EGO was below the detection limit of the gas chromatograph. The poisoning effect might be due to the other intermediate products such as glycolate and formate. It is known that Pt has greater ability to oxidize CO to CO2 hence CO could not appear in the GC spectra. [46,47]. The potentials used in this work (0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1.0 V. vs. RHE) were large enough for oxidation of CO. The excellent distribution of PtSACs on the support helps to achieve the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Pt and TiO2 support. This SMSI helps PtSACs/TiO2 catalyst to be more CO-poisoning tolerant and to exhibit superior electrochemical stability. Additionally, this can further be ascribed to the strong interaction between PtSAC and support. Hence this catalyst can further undergo oxidation of carbonaceous intermediate products. To further check the stability of the Pt single atoms on its support (PtSAC/TiO2), evaluating the change in crystal structure can be considered as one means to check the stability. In the case single atom catalysts are changed into their nanoparticle form, there appears a change in XRD pattern. However, the XRD pattern of PtSAC/TiO2 after EGO didn’t show a change in diffraction pattern compared to its XRD pattern before durability test Fig. S19-SI. This indicates that no Pt crystal structure is formed even after durability test. The Pt JCPDS standard data also further confirmed the absence of Pt crystal structure in the PtSAC/TiO2. This might be due to the single atom nature of Pt in PtSAC/TiO2 even after durability test for EGO. 4 Conclusion We successfully designed and synthesized PtSAC/TiO2 using a hydrothermal assisted co-precipitation method of synthesis. The features of Pt single-atom catalysts were confirmed by HAADF-STEM and XAS analyses. The catalyst was applied for partial oxidation of EG to value added products and showed excellent catalytic activity and selectivity. From the EXAFS analysis, the only coordination environment of Pt-O in PtSAC/TiO2 not only proves the evidence of the presence of Pt single atoms, but also hints for us to understand the difference to PtNP/TiO2, when concerning their activity and stability performance. Contradicting to the nanosized references, PtSAC/TiO2 is characterized by a high Jf/Jb ratio in CV tests, indicating that it either has a lower adsorption for the reaction intermediates of EGO, or TiO2 support plays a synergistic role in facilitating the removal of the reaction intermediates from the active sites. It suggests that the spillover of TiO2-OHads weakens the binding of CO, thus maintains reasonable reaction kinetics and activity. With the as-synthesized PtSAC/TiO2 catalyst exhibits an excellent Faradaic efficiency of 99.7 % and remarkable stability, with a minimal current drop within 12 h in an alkaline solution. The Pt single-atom electrocatalyst on TiO2 provides stronger electronic interaction between Pt and TiO2, which proves advantageous for the stability, one of the major challenges in view of the practicality of SACs. We believe that similar oxide supported SAC concepts can be further extended to many examples reactions in practice.

        "dc:description": "The application of single-atom catalysts (SACs) receives excellent attention in producing fine chemicals. SACs demonstrate higher activity, selectivity, stability and are more economical. Herein we designed and successfully synthesized an electrochemical catalyst consisting of Pt single atoms on titanium oxide support (PtSAC/TiO2) via hydrothermal assisted co-precipitation method, which is simple, fast, and efficient. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and FT- EXAFS spectra disclose that Pt atoms are well dispersed and show no Pt–Pt coordination. We are the first to apply SACs for partial oxidation of Ethylene glycol (EGO) using PtSAC/TiO2. The strong metal support interaction (SMSI) between Pt and TiO2 and the availability of identical Pt active sites enhanced catalytic selectivity of PtSAC/TiO2. These help EG oxidation on PtSAC/TiO2 to produce glycolate and formate selectively. The higher surface contacts between PtSAC and EG lead to an improved catalytic performance towards EGO. Our stability tests demonstrated that PtSAC/TiO2 showed a slower current decay rate and higher oxidation current density, thus providing better electrocatalytic activity and stability. Hence, PtSAC/TiO2 led to higher reactivity and provided a higher current density response. The as-synthesized PtSAC/TiO2 catalyst exhibits an excellent Faradaic efficiency of 99.7 % and remarkable stability, with a very minimal current drop within 12 h in an alkaline solution.",
