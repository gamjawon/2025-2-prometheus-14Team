A. Cabello, J. M. Campelo*, A. Garcia, D. Luna and J. M. Marinas Department of Organic Chemistry, Cordoba University, E-14004 Cordoba (Spain) (Received March 27, 1992; revised June 4, 1992) Abstract The catalytic activity of Rh (1 wt.%) catalysts supported on AIP04 and sepiolite has been studied in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of linear 1-alkenes. The reaction orders with respect to 1-alkene concentration are negative but are first order with respect to hydrogen, indicating that 1-alkene adsorbs very strongly on Rh sites and alkene and Hz compete for adsorption sites on the surface. The initial hydrogenation rates increase in the order 1-hexene < 1-heptene < 1-octene, and furthermore, on going from 1-hexene to 1-octene the steric effects (through AS) are activating, while electronic effects (from AH # ) deactivate the reaction process. A cis-concerted mechanism taking place in a single step on a Rh site with three coordinative unsaturations which can simultaneously adsorb hydrogen and a a-bonded alkene is suggested. Introduction Supported rhodium catalysts are studied extensively in both chemical and industrial processes, such as carbon monoxide hydrogenation, reduction of nitrogen monoxide in automobile exhaust gas and in the hydroformylation of olefins. The use of very well dispersed rhodium on a support is of obvious importance, not only from economical point of view but also from the point of view of the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. In addition, the surface structure and catalytic properties of supported rhodium catalysts are strongly affected by the nature of the inorganic support as well as by the preparation method. The influence of structure on reactivity is also a topic of current interest in the study of the mechanism of alkene hydrogenation on supported metal catalysts [ 1, 2 ]. In this sense, we have previously studied the liquid-phase hydrogenation of functionalized alkene substrates in the CHZ=CH-R, Ph-CH=CH-R, Ph-CH=CH-CO-R and R-CH=CH-R forms (E-isomers and R bearing a variety of organic functions) with supported rhodium catalysts on AlP04, AlP04-Si02 and sepiolite [ 3-11 ]. These supported rhodium catalysts have enabled us to achieve 100% selectivity in the hydrogenation of the *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 0 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

Only allyl alcohols yielded the side-reaction product corresponding to the isomerization of the C=C bond to form carbonyl compounds and, in some cases, a slight degree of hydrogenolysis of the C-O bond. In all cases, the reaction is a function of both the substituents of the olefinic bond and the support of the rhodium catalyst. Also, in all cases except allyl alcohols, the hydrogenation is a noncompetitive process with irreversible adsorption of the olefinic compound. Our aim in this work was to expand research in this field by studying the liquid-phase hydrogenation of simple linear 1-alkenes at low hydrogen pressures and temperatures in the 293-323 K range on Rh/AlP04 and Rh/ sepiolite catalysts. Thus, we have obtained data on differential kinetic behaviour of supported rhodium catalysts for these simple 1-alkenes, through a reaction process involving competition between alkene and hydrogen for surface Rh active sites. Experimental Supports Two different supports were used. AIP04 was prepared by precipitation from AIC13 - 6H20 and H~P04 (85 wt.%) aqueous solution with propylene oxide and calcined at 923 K for 3 h (AP-P-923; surface area (BET method): 229 m2 g-'; pore volume: 0.75 ml g-'). Natural sepiolite (85 wt.%), named Pansil (PS), originally from Vallecas-Madrid (Spain) and provided by Tolsa S.A., was mechanically micronized in a dry medium; its chemical analysis is: Si02 62.0, Mg0 23.9, A1203 1.7, FC203 0.5, Ca0 0.5, Kz0 0.6, Na20 0.3%; weight loss from 293 to 1273 K, 10.5%. The presence of smectite, quartz and dolomite as significant impurities was detected. The PS sample was calcined at 573 K for 3 h (PS-573; surface area (BET method): 197 m2 g-'; pore volume: 0.54 ml g-'). At higher temperatures the sepiolite loses its constitutional water, with a consequent folding of the structure, loss of channel volume and important changes in fibrous texture [ 12 ]. Supported rhodium catalysts Systems containing 1 wt.% rhodium were prepared by impregnation of the supports to incipient wetness with aqueous rhodium(III) chloride following the procedure previously described [3-11 ]. They were dried, crushed and screened to a particle size of < 0.149 mm. The samples (50-100 mg) were reduced at 473 K in an ultrapure hydrogen stream (99.999ss'o, HZO < 3 ppm) (200 ml min-') for 15 min immediately before the catalytic hydrogenation reaction. These conditions lead to better catalysts, as has previously been shown [3-11 ]. Hydrogenation runs Hydrogenations were carried out in the liquid phase in a closed vessel, under vigorous shaking, in a conventional low-pressure hydrogenator (Parr 251 Instruments model 3911) equipped with a manometer that constantly monitored the hydrogen pressure in the isolated reaction vessel. The reaction temperature was controlled by pumping water from a thermostatic bath through the vessel jacket (the accuracy was 0.5 K). Reactions were carried out with 25 ml of a 1 M methanol solution of the 1-alkene (1-hexene, 1heptene or 1-octene) under an initial hydrogen pressure of 0.55 MPa and at a temperature in the range 293-323 K. The analyses were performed on a HP-5720 gas chromatograph equipped with an FID and using a stainless-steel column (3 m X 3 mm) packed with 5% squalane on Chromosorb G AW-DMCS 80/100 at 313-358 K. The only products detected were those corresponding to saturation of the C=C bond. No side isomerization reaction products were detected in these experiments. Catalyst activities were determined from the rate of hydrogen uptake and the time dependence of the concentration of the reacting substances and are reported as mol min-1 gRh 1. The rate data were averaged among at least three kinetic runs and the relative error is approximately 8%. Results and discussion Diffusion control Hydrogen diffusion control in hydrogenation was examined first. Previous hydrogenation runs in various agitation regimes and with different amounts of catalyst had shown that the initial hydrogenation rates are directly proportional to catalyst weight and not affected by the shaking regime ( > 300 min-1), i.e., external diffusion is absent. Internal diffusion is excluded by the sufficiently small particle size of the catalyst (< 0.149 mm). To evaluate the activity of the rhodium catalysts, the initial rates of hydrogenation were obtained from a least-squares fit to the slopes of initially linear curves of hydrogen consumption vs. reaction time. Furthermore, a plot of reciprocal initial rate against reciprocal mass of catalyst (1/R vs. 1/M is also linear, and from the inverse of the intercept at the origin [ 13 ], a hydrogen-transfer rate higher than any initial rate (30-50 orders of magnitude) was obtained for all alkenes and supported rhodium catalysts. This supported the idea that the hydrogenation rate is kinetically controlled. Reaction kinetic orders Under the present reaction conditions at 293 K, the reaction order in the initial hydrogen pressure, determined between 0.3 and 0.7 MPa, was unity for all alkenes and supported rhodium catalysts. On the other hand, the reaction order in substrate concentration, determined for concentrations in the 0.4-2 M range, was found to be negative in all cases (about - 0.4 and - 0.5 for Rh/AlP04 and Rh/sepiolite catalysts, respectively). This fact 252 indicates that alkene and hydrogen compete for adsorption sites on the surface. So, in the hydrogenation of simple linear 1-alkenes on Rh/AlP04 and Rh/sepiolite catalysts, the alkene adsorption is strong and hydrogen adsorption is weak but competitive with alkene. First-order dependence also implies that two hydrogen atoms are involved in the transition state of the rate-determining step. Thus it is consistent with the observed kinetic orders to consider a rhodium hydrogenation surface to be largely occupied by hydrocarbon, leaving a small and constantly increasing area that is accessible only to hydrogen. Since chemisorption of alkene is very fast, the hydrogenation rate could be assumed to be proportional to the rate at which hydrogen reaches available rhodium active sites. However, the hydrogenation rate, alternatively, could also be proportional to the number of surface metal atoms able to act as active sites and which would increase with hydrogen pressure. Catalytic activities aged activation parameters Table 1 collects the initial hydrogenation rates of 1-alkenes, at an initial hydrogen pressure of 0.55 MPa and at various temperatures (293-323 K), obtained using Rh/AP-P-923 and Rh/PS-573 catalysts. The initial rates r were obtained from least-squares fits to the slopes of the initially linear curves of hydrogen consumption vs. reaction time. The results obtained in the temperature range studied fit the Arrhenius equation, which permits us to obtain the corresponding values of the apparent activation energies Ea and the Arrhenius constant In A, also given in Table 1. The Eyring equation also evaluates the temperature dependence of reaction rates in terms of transition-state theory by separating the enthalpy, AH#, and entropy, AS \", components. The corresponding values are also shown in Table 1. When dealing with OH # it is necessary to point out that it reflects the difference between the internal energy of the activated complex and that of the reactants. Thus it is also related to the electronic state of the substrate (and catalyst). On the other hand, AS' (which measures the degree of order or disorder produced in the formation of activated complexes) ought to be related, first, to the steric characteristics of the reactant and catalyst, indicating whether adsorption of the reactant molecules is hindered, and to what degree. Furthermore, according to the Eyring equation, an increase in these parameters indicates that electronic effects associated with the enthalpy factor diminish reactivity, while steric effects, associated with the entropy factor, lead to an enhancement of the reactivity. Consequently, on going from 1-hexene to 1-octene the steric effects, shown in the higher AS * values, are activating, whereas the electronic effects (through the higher values of OH $) are deactivating. However, the steric effects of alkene adsorption onto supported rhodium seem to be more significant, since the activity of alkene hydrogenation increases on going from 1-hexene to 1-octene.

At a react. temp. of 313 K. w 254 Reaction mechanism The results can be interpreted within the context of the cis-concerted mechanism suggested for the hydrogenation of allyl alcohols on Rh/AIP04 catalysts [8 ]. The character of the hydrogenation mechanism is considered, according to the terminology proposed by Dewar et al. [14, 151 to be a concerted reaction taking place in a single step on a 3M site with three vacant surface orbitals. This is different from a concerted synchronous reaction, in which all the bond-breaking and bond-making processes take place simultaneously [ 14, 15 ]. In the cis-concerted mechanism (Fig. 1), the active sites on the rhodium surface are found on a surface complex with three degrees of coordinative unsaturation, 3M sites [ 16-18 ], where it is possible to adsorb two hydrogen atoms and an alkene (mainly 7r-bonded, since there is no aikene isomerization) at the same time. The transfer of the two hydrogen atoms to the double bond through a concerted process directly gives alkane formation. Here we have the three classical steps postulated by Horiuty and Polanyi [ 19 ], although we think that the concerted evolution of the transition state explains the usual cis-addition, nonreversal character and double-bond isomerization in allyl alcohols [8] better than the classically postulated half-hydrogenated species does [20, 21 ]. Whether or not the new bonds in the concerted mechanism form simultaneously is an open question. Besides, this kind of active site (i.e., with three degrees of coordinative unsaturation, where the simultaneous adsorption of hydrogen and alkene is obtained) can explain the involvement of the two hydrogen atoms in the rate transition state and the competitive adsorption of alkene and hydrogen at the rhodium active site. Also, it accounts for the different number of rhodium surface atoms that are able to act as active sites at each hydrogen pressure. In this sense, Augustine et al. [18] indicate that the most active 3M sites are those having the more loosely held hydrogen (3 MR-reversibly adsorbed hydrogen). They are about four times more active than sites at which the hydrogen is more tightly bound (3M,-irreversibly adsorbed hydrogen). Besides, sites at which the alkane is formed by successive two-step addition of H atoms ('M-classically postulated) are the least active. Moreover, the presence of hydrogen atoms a to the C=C bond makes the formation of 7r-allyl intermediates possible, but as we however do not - Rh - HZC= CHR + H2 H2C=rCHR H-Rn-H H2C T CHR H- Rn-H H3C- CHZR + - Rn - Fig. 1. Mechanism of the liquid-phase hydrogenation of simple linear 1-alkenes over Rh/APP-923 and Rh/PS-573 catalysts. 255 obtain alkene isomers, we assume that an alkene 7r-bonded to the rhodium metal site is the more probable intermediate. The transfer of the two hydrogens to the double bond through a concerted process, where the interaction with the catalyst removes the symmetry restrictions imposed by the Woodward-Hoffman rules, leads directly to alkane formation [22]. Another possible interpretation, suggested by a referee, may be the concerted addition of a hydrogen molecule to the 1-alkene, as in the hydrogenation of alkenes with organometallic complexes [23]. In this sense a weakly adsorbed HZ may quite likely be a ligand at a highly unsaturated Rh site, especially if hydrogen adsorption is very strongly inhibited by the adsorption of the alkene, as occurs in our case. Conclusions The hydrogenation of simple linear 1-alkenes on rhodium supported on AIP04 and sepiolite differs from that of cyclic alkenes and alkenes with an organic functional group in the a-position, except for allyl alcohols. Thus, while in the latter cases the catalytic hydrogenation is a noncompetitive process with irreversible chemisorption of the alkene, in the former one the alkene adsorption is strong and hydrogen adsorption is weak but competitive with alkene. Besides, on lengthening the carbon chain of the 1-alkene, the steric effects (through 0,5'*) are activating, while electronic effects (from OH*) are deactivating. However, the former predominates, and thus the activity of 1-alkene hydrogenation increases on going from 1-hexene to 1octene. A cis-concerted mechanism taking place on a rhodium site with three degrees of coordinative unsaturation is suggested. At that site the alkene and the hydrogen can be adsorbed in a competitive way.

        "dc:description": "The catalytic activity of Rh (1 wt.%) catalysts supported on AlPO4 and sepiolite has been studied in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of linear 1-alkenes. The reaction orders with respect to 1-alkene concentration are negative but are first order with respect to hydrogen, indicating that 1-alkene adsorbs very strongly on Rh sites and alkene and H2, compete for adsorption sites on the surface. The initial hydrogenation rates increase in the order 1-hexene < 1-heptene < 1-octene, and furthermore, on going from 1-hexene to 1-octene the steric effects (through ΔS ≠) are activating, while electronic effects (from ΔH ≠) deactivate the reaction process. A cis-concerted mechanism taking place in a single step on a Rh site with three coordinative unsaturations which can simultaneously adsorb hydrogen and a π-bonded alkene is suggested.",
