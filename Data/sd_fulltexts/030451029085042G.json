C. GRUNEWALD and R. S. DRAGO Department of Chemistry, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 (U.SA.) (Received February 17,1989; revised July 6,1989) Summary Catalysts based on pyrolyzed polymeric systems and high surface area carbons have been investigated for their activity in the oxidative dehydroge- nation of ethylbenzene to styrene. A relationship between surface area and activity is established, with high surface area materials displaying greater activity. One material in particular, ultrahigh surface area carbon molecular sieves, exhibits extraordinary reactivity 80% conversion with over 90% selectivity to styrene in a single pass at 350 C. This is more active than recently reported inorganic oxide-based catalysts at a significantly lower temperature. The results are consistent with the proposal that the carb- onaceous overlayer observed in many inorganic oxide systems is the true catalyst, and that the surface structure of this carbon is the key to the catalytic activity. Introduction The industrial process for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene employs a promoted iron oxide catalyst [1]. Since this direct dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction and is limited by equilibrium, high reactor temperatures are required (in excess of 600 C) and typical conversions are low (seldom exceeding 50%). For these reasons, there has been a great deal of interest in oxidative dehydrogenation schemes [2 6]. The formation of HgO as a byproduct of the oxidation reaction makes the process exothermic and theoretically enables complete conversion. An addi- tional advantage is that lower reaction temperatures can be used. The systems most often studied for the oxidative process are based on promoted inorganic oxide catalysts. Murakami and co-workers have studied a SnOg PzOg catalyst and found it to have moderate activity greater than 30% conversion with greater than 80% selectivity at 550 C [3]. Their work focused particularly on the role promoters play in modifying the acid-base properties of the catalysts. Emig and Hofmann have reported a ZrOa-PgOg system which is slightly more active in the same temperature range conversions up to 55% with over 80% selectivity [4]. Vrieland has similarly worked with phosphate-promoted catalysts and has recently reported a 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 228 cerium pyrophosphate system which exhibits 76% conversion with 90% selectivity at 605 C [5]. In addition to focusing on the acid base properties of the system, the latter two studies also investigated the role of carb- onaceous overlayers on the surface of the catalyst. It was determined that each of the various systems studied had an induction period during which a thin uniform layer of carbon built up on the surface. A subsequent study suggested that the nature of the layer is a circular pattern of condensed rings [5(b)j. In another recent study, Cadus and coworkers similarly found carbon overlayers present on a sodium-doped alumina catalyst [6]. They provide a mechanism to show how the carbonaceous species, not the inorganic oxide, brings about the catalytic transformation. There is strong evidence, then, that the actual catalytic surface in this reaction may be primarily carbon and carbonaceous substances. Charcoals have been known to exhibit dehydrogenation ability [7], and it is possible that the catalytic reactivity in metal oxide systems is a function of the carbon, with the inorganic oxide providing acid-base properties to form the carbon layer. The focus of this research is to investigate the reactivity of various carbon-based systems for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylben- zene. Comparisons will be made between different types of carbon systems to investigate the effects of structure and surface area on catalytic activity. Experimental Catalysts All pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile (PPAN) preparations used commercially available PAN (Aldrich). PPAN1 is formed by straight-forward pyrolysis of a 5.0 g sample in N3 atmosphere, employing a temperature program designed to maximize the fused pyridine ring functionality [8]. PPAN2 is a 50/50 weight mixture of PAN and NHLiCl (lOg total) pyrolyzed under the same conditions as PPAN1. PPAN3 is pyrolyzed according to literature procedure using a two-step process [9]. First, it is slowly heated in an air atmosphere to 230 C. Next the carrier gas is converted to N3 and pyrolysis continues to 400 C. Again, a 5.0 g sample is used. The surface areas of the three samples were determined by an adsorption method and were found to be 8, 50 and lOn^g\"1 respectively. The AlgOs sample (Davison) had a surface area of 360 m2 g~1. It was calcined at 350 C and subsequently dried in vacua at 100 C prior to use. The activated carbon (A.C.) sample (Mallinckrodt) was dried in vacuo at 100 C prior to use. It had a nominal surface area of 800 v^g^. The Carbon Molecular Sieve (CMS) sample (Anderson Development Company AX 21) was also dried in vacw at 100 C before use, and its reported surface area is >3000m2g-l. 229 Reactor The reactor employed was a syringe-pumped, fixed bed flow reactor situated in a vertical glass oven using 0.5 g of catalyst for each experiment. The temperature, monitored via a thermocouple in contact with the catalyst bed, was typically 350 C. Inert glass beads were placed on top of the catalyst to facilitate complete vaporization of the substrate. Catalyst bed height was one inch and the vaporization zone had a height of six inches. The carrier gas flow rate was 5 ml min~1 and the substrate delivery rate 0.2 ml h~1. Products were condensed in a trap maintained at 0 C. Analysis The PPAN samples were studied with infrared spectroscopy (Nicolet FTIR) and found to compare very well with previously reported samples [10]. Elemental analysis of the AX21 sample was performed by Desert Analytics Microanalytical Laboratories of Tucson, AZ. Products of the catalytic experiments were analyzed via gas chromatography using a Varian 3400 GC with a 3 m Dega S column and a flame ionization detector. The GC column temperature was ramped from 75-150 C at lO^min\"1. Product identification and verification was made by GC-MS using a Varian 3400 GC interfaced with a Finnegan MAT ITDS 700 mass spectrometer. Employed for this technique was a 15 m DB1 column operated isothermally at 40 C. Reported conversion percentages are based on the difference between the moles of ethylbenzene substrate entering the reactor and the moles exiting into the post-reactor stream. Reported selectivities are based on the percentage conversion to styrene. Results and discussion The results of the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over the various catalyst samples studied are listed in Table 1.

See [15]. 230 for all runs is 350 C. This was chosen for a number of reasons. One of the goals of this work is to find a system with high activity at lower tempera- tures. Since traditionally this reaction is carried out at temperatures in excess of 600 C, the choice of 350 C was reasonable. Initially, work was carried out at 250 C and all the systems exhibited some activity; however, the higher temperature systems were more active. Temperatures much above 350 C are not suitable for the PPAN samples, due to the possibility of further pyrolysis of the support. PPAN is made by pyrolizing PAN up to 400 C. Above this temperature, additional structural rearrangements and surface volatilization occurs. The AlgOg experiment was carried out in order to compare the reactivity of a typical high surface area inorganic oxide under the particular reaction conditions employed. As is shown in Table 1, the sample is not very active. Pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile (PPAN) was chosen as a possible catalyst for this reaction because it is primarily a carbon-based material which has been reported to be active in dehydrogenation schemes [11]. The proposed method of its activity involves its condensed pyridine ring structure, which can be hydrogenated to give an acridan-type moiety. The catalytic cycle is completed when the hydrogenated PPAN reacts with oxygen to produce HaO and the original catalyst. PPAN1, which is prepared by pyrolysis of PAN, shows moderate activity with high selectivity. One of the disadvantages of the PPAN made this way is its very low surface area. For this reason, we investigated co-pyrolysis agents which could volatilize during the heating cycle and thus increase the surface area. The best results were achieved with a 50% loading of NH4C1. Since the last structural rearrangement for the formation of the condensed pyridine ring functionality occurs around 300 C [8, 10 ], and NH4C1 sublimes at 340 C, the resulting product (PPAN2) has a significantly greater surface area. The effect of this co-pyrolysis on the catalytic activity is dramatic. Conversion is nearly doubled, with no loss in selectivity. PPAN3 is prepared according to the pyrolysis procedure of Degannes and Ruthven [9]. This method employs an air carrier flow during the initial stage of heating. We have shown previously that this practice results in a significant amount of oxygen incorporation into the PPAN sample produced [8]. The bulk of the oxygenated species are most likely pyridone moieties. PPAN3 has been reported to be an active catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. The conversions we observe under our conditions with this material are between those of PPAN1 and PPAN2, but the selectivity is lower. It is evident from this study that the surface area of the PPAN is a very important parameter for catalyst reactivity. This suggested the investigation of high surface area carbon systems. The activated carbon (A.C.) system studied is as active as the best PPAN system, with a selectivity almost as high. However, since the surface area of the A.C. (800 ^^) is more than an order of magnitude greater than the highest surface area PPAN sample, it is surprising that the conversion is not significantly higher. Clearly then, 281 surface area is not the only parameter that is essential to this reaction, and surface structure must also play a major role. Carbon molecular sieves (CMS) are a relatively new class of materials with some very exciting properties [12]. The sample that is investigated here, AX21, was prepared by the high temperature 0900 C) pyrolysis of coal tar residues using a patented process [13]. The material has a uniform surface structure and a very narrow pore size range. This is in contrast to the completely amorphous nature of common activated charcoals. Additionally, the AX21 material possesses an exceptionally high surface area. Typical surface area measurements made by the standard BET method [14] are consistently in excess of 3000 n^g\"1. This value underscores the extraor- dinary nature of this compound. The theoretical maximum for surface area based on a monolayer of carbon, including the area on both sides of the plane, is 2620 m2 g~1 [15]. Since this maximum is not possible for any real material, it is clear that this compound is on the threshold of sensitivity for surface area measurement techniques, and is among the most porous materials ever synthesized. CMS materials such as this are being actively studied in a variety of catalytic schemes [16]. The activity of the AX21 catalyst shown in Table 1 is remarkable. It is more than three times as active as any of the systems we have studied and it is more active than any of the recently reported systems [3-6] at a significantly lower temperature (active at 350 C compared to 600 C). The data reported in Table 1 are mostly for a 20 h reaction time period. We have, however, studied these systems over longer duration. The CMS system was run for five days under continuous flow conditions, with no appreciable loss in either conversion or selectivity being observed. Further- more, the carrier gas can be cycled from air to N3 to air again, and the product profile remains essentially the same as that reported in Table 1. The CMS catalyst can even be removed from the system for several days and activity re-established when the reactor is set up again. From a mechanistic standpoint, all of the samples studied function via a hydrogen abstraction mechanism. It is difficult to conclusively determine whether this is hydrogen atom or hydride abstraction. Most likely it is a concerted process, as proposed by both the Emig and Cadus groups [4, 6]. In any case, the hydrogenated catalyst is then returned to its original state by reaction with air to produce HaO. The last two entries in Table 1 show the activity of both PPAM2 and AX21 when the system is run in an inert atmosphere. Very little conversion is observed under such conditions, and if either system is run for more than 5 h, no formation of product is observed. We propose that at such a point, the catalytic surface is fully hydrogenated and no more hydrogen abstraction can occur. This result shows that the reaction is an oxidative dehydrogenation and not a direct dehydrogenation. The reason for the extreme reactivity of the CMS system compared to the other catalysts studied is an issue we are actively pursuing. Obviously, the enormous surface area plays a role, but most likely other factors are involved. Elemental analysis of the AX21 sample reveals that it does contain 232 over 6% oxygen. The chemical nature of this oxygen content is probably very similar to the quinone-type moieties proposed to be present in the carb- onaceous overlayers on the inorganic oxide catalyst systems [4-6]. This suggests that the AX21 material has a surface structure particularly suited for hydrogen abstraction processes. The remainder of the elemental composi- tion of the AX21 material is, of course, mostly carbon (>90%) with a small ash content (2%) and traces of nitrogen and sulfur. Another factor which probably plays a role in the AX21 reactivity is its extraordinary adsorption capability. Toxicological studies have shown this material to be more than five times as effective in adsorbing organic poisons as other high surface area carbons [17]. Such an exceptional ability to adsorb substrate is a distinct advantage in heterogeneous catalytic applications. Together with a very high surface area which is highly reactive, these properties make the CMS system studied here an ideal catalyst material. Conclusions Various carbon-based catalysts have been shown to be both active and selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene at a temperature significantly below that used with inorganic oxide-based systems. One catalyst in particular, AX21, exhibits outstanding reactivity 80% conversion with greater than 90% selectivity in a single pass. A relationship between surface area and activity is established, but other factors such as surface structure and adsorption capacity also play major roles. References 1 E. H. Lee, Catal.

        "dc:description": "Catalysts based on pyrolyzed polymeric systems and high surface area carbons have been investigated for their activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene. A relationship between surface area and activity is established, with high surface area materials displaying greater activity. One material in particular, ultrahigh surface area carbon molecular sieves, exhibits extraordinary reactivity—80% conversion with over 90% selectivity to styrene in a single pass at 350 °C. This is more active than recently reported inorganic oxide-based catalysts at a significantly lower temperature. The results are consistent with the proposal that the carbonaceous overlayer observed in many inorganic oxide systems is the true catalyst, and that the surface structure of this carbon is the key to the catalytic activity.",
