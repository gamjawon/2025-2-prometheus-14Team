Graphical abstract Highlights ► Bio-inspired polydopamine (PDOP) coating were demonstrated for supported catalyst applications. ► Superior catalytic operational stability was obtained. ► PDOP coating alone exhibited ability to reduce o-nitroaniline. Herein, a simple but versatile method to develop supported-metal catalysts based on a polydopamine (PDOP) coating and electroless plating of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) onto nanomaterials (e.g., anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes and polystyrene (PS) nanotubes) for catalytic reduction is demonstrated. The PDOP coating was inspired by the composition of adhesive proteins in mussels. A comparative study on the catalytic activities of the individual AgNPs, AgNPs/PDOP/AAOs with different pore sizes (20–200nm) and AgNPs/PDOP/PS nanotubes in the reduction of o-nitroaniline (o-NA) to 1,2-benzenediamine (BDA) was carried out. The results indicated that both AgNPs/PDOP/AAO (200nm) and AgNPs/PDOP/PS exhibited significantly higher catalytic activities than individual AgNPs. We also observed that the PDOP coating alone had the ability to reduce o-NA to BDA. Given their simplicity, efficiency, and flexibility, we believe that these types of green catalysts might find a wide range of applications in organic synthesis and catalysis.

Therefore, various innovative strategies, including immobilization of the catalysts onto inorganic or organic supports [3,4], liquid/liquid biphasic extractions [5,6], and solvent-free transformations [7,8] have been attempted to develop green catalysts. Although, most supported catalysts have been successfully recycled, the recovered catalysts have some disadvantages, such as lower activities and selectivities, compared to their non-supported analogues. To achieve the desired catalytic activity and selectivity, understanding the interface between the support material and the catalytic moiety, controlling nanoparticle size, shape and density, and tuning of the supports are all important aspects. These problematic variables are quite complex, however, so the design and control of supported-metal catalysts is still a serious challenge in catalysis and materials research. Nanoparticles, which have catalytic activity, are mostly needed a suitable and stable support to prevent aggregation during the catalytic reaction, and also to provide reusabilty. In recent years, several methods have been reported to immobilize metal nanoparticles on high surface area support materials. The most remarkable techniques for the immobilization of metal particles are direct immobilization onto support and ion exchange [9–12]. Both approaches have some drawbacks. In direct immobilization technique, chemically active supports or extra modification steps are required to immobilize nanoparticles. Moreover, poor immobilized nanoparticle density is another big problem. As for ion exchange technique, certain types of support materials with an ion exchange resin, which mostly consist of a polymeric matrix and a functional group with a mobile ion, is needed to generate metal nanoparticles onto support from a metal precursors in solution phase. Therefore, new techniques, which may provide flexibility in selection of the support materials and high density nanoparticle immobilization or generation, are still crucial. Recently, Messersmith and co-workers reported a surface modification method [13] using a polydopamine (PDOP) coating based on oxidative polymerization of dopamine in alkaline aqueous media. PDOP coating is a material-independent approach and may be applied to almost any solid surface (e.g., metal oxides, ceramics, and synthetic polymers) on which biomineralization, cell adhesion, wetting control and protein immobilization can occur [14–17]. This method also serves for in situ growing of metal nanoparticles. Despite the superior properties of PDOP, its use in catalysis applications as a support material remains unexplored. In this work, a simple and useful strategy is demonstrated for developing supported-metal catalysts based on PDOP coating and electroless plating of silver on nanoporous anodic alumina membranes (AAO) with various pore sizes (20–200nm) and on polystyrene (PS) nanotubes (Scheme 1a and b). Their catalytic efficiencies in the reduction of o-nitroaniline (o-NA) using sodium borohydride were evaluated. The reduction of o-NA is a model reaction that has been widely used for the quantification and comparison of the catalytic activity of different metal nanoparticles and their immobilized forms. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of AgNPs/PDOP/AAOs and AgNPs/PDOP/PS nanotubes All the chemicals and solvents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Deionized water of 18MΩcm−1 was also used in the experiments and for rinsing. The following protocol was used to prepare AgNPs/PDOP/AAOs: 20mg of dopamine was first dissolved in 10mL of Tris–HCl buffer solution (10mM, pH 8.5), and AAO membranes (Whatman, Inc., USA) having different pore sizes (i.e., 20, 100 and 200nm) were then immersed in this solution for various time intervals (3–24h). Afterwards, PDOP-coated membranes were transferred into an AgNO3 solution (50mM) for 24h to grow silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). To prepare AgNPs/PDOP/PS nanotubes, two drops of PS solution (10%, w/w) in toluene were first placed onto the 200nm pore size AAO membrane. After solvent evaporation, samples were soaked in a phosphoric acid solution (5%, v/v) for 30min, which resulted in the widening of the nanopores of the AAO. Afterwards, the inner and outer walls of the PS nanotubes were coated with PDOP, and AAO templates were completely etched with a 5% H3PO4 and 1% HF solution. AgNPs were formed on the top and sides of the PDOP-coated nanotube as mentioned above. 2.2 Catalytic reduction of o-nitroaniline A typical catalysis experiment was carried out as follows. A AgNPs solution (1.02nM) or prepared supported-catalyst was first dispersed in a mixture of 10mL of deionized water and 10mL of a freshly prepared NaBH4 solution (1.2M). The mixture was stirred for 30min at room temperature. The o-NA solution (10mL, 3.4×10−3M) was then added to the mixture and stirred at room temperature until the yellow solution became colorless. The catalyst efficiency was monitored by removing aliquots of the reaction mixture at certain time periods and measuring the UV–vis spectra. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 AgNPs/PDOP/AAOs In the first part, we prepared PDOP-coated nanopores using dopamine as a monomer and AAO membranes as the template material (Scheme 1a). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to confirm the PDOP coating and AgNP formations on the AAO surface. Fig. 1 shows the XPS spectra of pristine AAO, PDOP-coated AAO and AgNPs impregnated PDOP/AAO surfaces. It can be seen in the figure that the binding energies of Al 2p, Al 2s and O 1s peaks are approximately 77.6, 122.4 and 534.4eV, respectively, corresponding to characteristic regions of an anodic alumina membrane (Fig. 1a). A weak C1s peak at 292.8eV was due to minor hydrocarbon contamination. The PDOP-coated AAO surfaces also exhibited C (1s: 287.2eV) and N (1s: 401.6eV) peaks in addition to characteristic AAO peaks (Fig. 1b). After the formation of AgNPs on PDOP layers, XPS spectra showed that there were strong Ag3d5 peaks at 370.4eV (3d1/2) and 376.8eV (3d3/2), confirming the formation of AgNPs (Fig. 1c). Prepared silver nanoparticles on the PDOP layer were crystalline and displayed four distinct peaks at the 2θ values of 38.1°, 44.3°, 64.5° and 77.6°, corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) crystalline planes of silver. The formation of AgNPs on the PDOP-coated AAO was also confirmed through SEM (Fig. 2a and b). When compared with the pristine AAO membrane (Fig. S1), AgNPs were successfully formed on the top and sides of the PDOP-coated porous AAO. In addition, the nanoparticle density for 24h polymerization was significantly higher than for 3h (Fig. S1B). Moreover, the reductive capacity of the PDOP layer was apparently sufficient to eliminate the reducing agent in the metal salt solution. The catalytic activities of the AgNPs/PDOP/AAO substrates were examined in the reduction of o-NA using sodium borohydride as the stoichiometric reducing agent. This activity was critical because such aromatic nitro compounds are one of the most refractory pollutants resulting from the production of pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, and synthetic dyes in industrial wastewaters [18,19]. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) also lists nitrophenols among the top 114 organic pollutants. Therefore, this model reaction not only allows investigation of catalytic properties, but it is also interesting from the point of view of pollution abatement. As a control experiment, the catalytic activity of individual AgNPs (approximately 18nm) was first examined. The peak at 410nm gradually decreased with time, a behavior that was attributed to the reduction of yellow-colored o-NA in solution. Complete conversion was observed in 20min (Fig. S2a). Notice that the catalysis reaction in the absence of AgNPs was quite slow and that only 3% of the o-NA molecules were converted to BDA after 24h (Fig. S2b). Next, the catalytic efficiencies of modified AAO membranes were tested. Fig. 3a–c shows the UV–vis spectra for the reduction of o-NA using modified-AAO membranes of various pore sizes. After immersing the AgNPs/PDOP/AAOs, the peak height at 410nm rapidly decreased for all situations. The catalytic conversions were completed in 20min for the AAO with a 200nm pore size, 25min for the 100nm pore size and 30min for the 20nm pore size. These catalytic differences were due to various reasons. First and foremost, formations and densities of AgNPs in the pore walls were different. In the case of this report, the driving force for the nanoparticle formation was redox active catechol and amine groups in the PDOP structure. To understand this effect, we tested the effect of PDOP thickness on the formation of AgNPs in AAO membranes having the same pore size. We found that the o-NA conversion was complete in 20min for the AgNPs formed on PDOP film with a 37.4nm thickness, while approximately 57.4% of the o-NA remained for the 6.31nm thick polymer film (Fig. S3a). Another important effect for the difference in catalysis was the nanoporous structure. The surface area of the AAO membranes was calculated using πr 2 × D × P, where r is pore radius, D is film thickness, and P is pore density (all geometrical dimensions estimated from the SEM observations). We found that the surface area of membranes was 7.81m2 for the 20nm AAO, 2.01m2 for the 100nm AAO and 1.13m2 for the 200nm AAO. Although surface areas decreased with increasing pore size, catalysis efficiency was improved, and the reduction reaction was completed in a shorter time. This phenomenon could be attributed to a lack of diffusion of o-NA molecules or insufficient polymerization of dopamine in the pores to reduce the silver salts. We also tested this surface area phenomenon using planar PDOP-coated silicon surfaces (1cm×1cm). The o-NA conversion was complete in 20min for an AAO membrane having a 200nm pore size, while 58.8% remained in the same time interval for silicon surfaces (PDOP thickness was identical for both situations) (Fig. S4). The kinetics of the reduction reaction was also determined in the presence of the title materials. Our reaction conditions maintained first order kinetics with respect to o-NA (ln[C]= kt +ln[C 0]). The ln(C) vs. time (T) plot showed a linear correlation for o-NA reduction, where C and C 0, the concentrations of o-NA initially and at time t, respectively, were calculated based on absorbance at 410nm by establishing a standard working curve (Fig. S5a). The rate constant (k) for the individual AgNPs and AgNPs/PDOP/AAO-200nm were estimated to be 6.1×10−2 min−1 and 7.9×10−2 min−1, respectively (Fig. S5b and c). 3.2 AgNPs/PDOP/PS nanotubes To increase the PDOP-coated surface area and improve handling, we prepared polystyrene (PS) nanotubes with 200nm pores prepared using a template-based wetting approach (Scheme 1b) [20–22]. Fig. 2c shows the well-aligned, high aspect ratio, and closely packed PS nanotubes with diameters having a narrow diameter distribution around 200nm (±13nm). After 24h of PDOP polymerization, AgNPs were formed spontaneously on the inner and outer walls of the polymeric nanotubes (Fig. 2d). The catalytic properties of the AgNPs/PDOP/PS nanotubes were examined as mentioned above. We observed that the catalytic conversion was completed after 10min (Fig. 3d). As we expected, when the PDOP-coated surface area was increased during the pore-widening process, AgNPs formed more densely on the inner and outer walls of the PS nanotubes. As a result, the reduction of o-NA was accelerated. In the literature, there are several works about using supported AgNPs for catalytic reduction of nitro compound [23–29]. In order to compare our results with other reported results, we have made a table. When all overall conversion times which were obtained using different substrate concentrations were considered, AgNPs/PDOP/PS was showed quite fast conversion efficiency (Table 1 ). Furthermore, the catalytic operational stability of AgNPs/PDOP/PS was evaluated. In all cases, substrates were first removed from the catalysis medium and washed with deionized water several times, then reintroduced into a fresh solution. The catalysts were found to retain about 78% of their relative activity after 5 rounds of recycle. 3.3 PDOP coating without AgNPs Interestingly, the PDOP layers were found to be enhanced o-NA reduction in nanopores. To understand this effect, we prepared PDOP-coated AAO surfaces without AgNPs employed them in catalysis. Although, the catalytic reaction was slow, approximately 56.2% of the o-NA molecules were converted to BDA in 180min (Fig. 4a). It is known that catechol groups are redox active molecules and that they can be transformed to 1,2-benzoquinone in the presence of an oxidant (in our case, o-NA) via a reversible two-electron, two-proton oxidation [30]. In this reaction, o-NA molecules are reduced to BDA, and catechol groups are oxidized to 1,2-benzoquinone. While this reaction proceeded, NaBH4 in the catalysis medium also acted as a reducing agent to regenerate catechol from 1,2-benzoquinone (Fig. 4b), driving the catalytic reduction of o-NA. An electron transfer process between the PDOP layer and the o-NA might have been another important reason for the observed catalytic activity. In this reduction process, o-NA molecules first interacted with the PDOP layer, and electron transfer occurred from the BH4 − and/or PDOP to the o-NA [31]. However, modeling and more detailed experiments are still needed to better understand this phenomenon. 4 Conclusions In summary, we demonstrated the activity of supported-metal catalysts based on a bio-inspired polymer coating with electroless plating of silver nanoparticles onto nanomaterials for the catalytic reduction of aromatic nitro compounds. Our results indicated that the reduction reaction was fastest in the presence of AgNPs/PDOP/PS. We also found that the PDOP coating alone had the ability to reduce o-NA to BDA. We believe that a PDOP coating combined with an electroless plating approach provides greater flexibility in the selection of support materials and nanoparticles for a variety of catalytic reactions.
