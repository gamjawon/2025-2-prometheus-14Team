PIETROPAOLO Istituto di Chimica Industriale, Facoltd di Scieme, Universitd di Messina, Messina (Italy) (Received October 21,1985, accepted January 3,1986) Summary Hydrocinnamaldehyde and phenylacetylene have been hydrogenated over Pt and Pt Sn catalysts. The Pt Sn system has been studied as a func- tion of the Pt/Sn ratio. In the hydrogenation of the C=C triple bond, ad- dition of tin to platinum causes a sharp decrease in the rate of reaction. In the hydrogenation of the C=0 group, an increase is instead observed at lower tin contents with a subsequent decrease at the higher Sn/Pt ratios. These results are discussed in terms of: (a) an interaction between tin and platinum which deactivates the active metal sites and (b) an interaction between hydrocinnamaldehyde and tin ions which enhances the reactivity of the C=0 group. Introduction In recent years bimetallic catalysts have received growing attention because of the commercial success of these systems in controlling activity, selectivity and stability with appropriate choice of the nature and the com- position of the components. An example of the improvement in catalyst performance is the addition of tin to Pt/Al;*^ reforming catalysts, which results in a higher catalytic activity in aromatization of hydrocarbons and in a better stability with respect to deactivation [1 - 8]. A modification of the catalytic properties of platinum by tin has been also observed for the electro- oxidation of methanol. Platinum-tin catalysts have been found to exhibit a methanol oxidation rate higher than that of pure platinum [9,10]. Recently we have used the Pt Sn system in the liquid phase hydro- genation of a, (3-unsaturated aldehydes [11, 12]. It was found that addition of tin chloride to Pt/nylon or Pt/C leads to a large increase in the overall rate of hydrogenation (more than three orders of magnitude) and to a high (75%) selectivity towards the formation of the corresponding unsaturated alcohol. It has been suggested that the promoting action of tin be attributed 0304-5102/86/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 366 to the presence of tin ions, and is related to their acidic properties which enhance the reactivity of the C=0 bond. In order to confirm this hypothesis, we have applied in this paper the same catalytic system to the hydrogenation of a saturated aldehyde. We have also extended the investigation to the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to obtain a more general picture of the catalytic performance of the bimetallic Pt Sn catalysts towards hydrogenation reactions. Experimental Materials Nylon 66 powder, used as catalyst support, was obtained by grinding pellets of commercial nylon 66 (SNIAMID) at liquid nitrogen temperature. The surface area of the powder was < 1 m2 g~1. Pt/nylon and Pt-Sn/nylon samples were prepared by impregnation under argon of nylon powder with a CaHsOH solution of HaPtCle or H^PtCle and SnCIa having the appropriate concentration of the metals. After filtering, excess solvent was removed at room temperature by evaporation under argon flow, and the resulting material was dried under vacuum at 343 K. Before catalytic activity measurements, the samples were reduced in situ at 343 K by bubbling H; for 1 h in a slurry of the catalyst in C2H50H. Chemical analysis of the catalysts obtained by atomic absorption is reported in Table 1. A Pt/C catalyst (0.89 wt.% Pt) was prepared by impregnation of activated carbon and used as reference sample.

Ultra-high purity H; was used after purification by passage through Pt/A^Oa at 673 K, followed by a molecular sieve trap. 367 Procedure Hydrogenations were carried out in a 100 ml four-necked flask fitted with a hydrogen reservoir, dropping funnel, thermocouple and a stirrer head with permanent magnetic coupling (Medimex). The catalyst (0.3 -1 g) was added to the required amount of solvent (25 cm3, 95% ethanol) then re- duced at 343 K for 1 h under Ha flow. After cooling at the reaction temper- ature (283 K), the substrate (0.4 -1 mmol) was injected through one arm of the flask. The reaction mixture was stirred at 600 rpm and operated at constant temperature and atmospheric pressure. The progress of the reaction was followed by analyzing a sufficient mumber of microsamples withdrawn from the reaction mixture. Chemical analysis of phenylacetylene hydrogenation products was performed with a gas chromatograph (DANI mod. 3800 with flame detector) employing a 3 mm i.d. X 2 m 0.2% Carbowax/60-80 mesh Carbopack C column operating at 433 K and using nitrogen as carrier. The reaction prod- ucts of hydrocinnamaldehyde hydrogenation were analyzed with a gas chromatograph (Carlo Erba mod. 4200 with flame detector) employing a 3 mm i.d. X 1.5 m 10% GP/SP2100 column operating at 423 K and using nitrogen as carrier. The absence of external diffusional limitations was veri- fied by preliminary runs carried out at different stirring conditions and with different amounts of catalysts. Results Phenylacetylene The results of the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene over Pt/C are reported in Fig. 1. The only products formed are styrene and ethylbenzene. The initial selectivity to ethylbenzene (calculated from extrapolation to zero 20 40 60 Time(min) Fig. 1. Hydrogenation of phenylacetylene over 0.89% Pt/C. Weight = 0.5 g, T= 283 K, A, phenylacetylene; , styrene; , ethylbenzene. 368 conversion) is about 14% and changes only slightly with conversion (17% at 70% conversion), indicating that initially styrene and ethylbenzene are formed mainly through a parallel reaction [13]. It is also noted that in the first stage of the reaction the rate of hydrogen consumption is slower. Once phenylacetylene has almost disappeared from the reaction vessel, styrene is further hydrogenated to ethylbenzene with a rate of reaction which is higher than that measured for the disappearance of the acetylenic compound. Sim- ilar results have been reported in the literature over Pt, Pd and Rh catalysts [13, 14]. This indicates that phenylacetylene is bonded to the catalytic surface much more strongly than the partially hydrogenated derivative, and acts as poison for the further hydrogenation of styrene. On the basis of the above results a triangular reaction scheme for the C=C triple bond hydro- genation can be proposed: CfiHg O^CH ^ C(,H5 CH=CH2 ^ CgH5 CH^ CH3 _(2)__________^ The occurrence of step (2) can be explained through two different hypotheses: (a) the rate of desorption of styrene is relatively slow, and there- fore a fraction of the adsorbed olefin can be hydrogenated to ethylbenzene; (b) the desorption is fast but the rate of diffusion is slow. This leads to a high local concentration of unsaturated compound and therefore to a non- negligible rate of adsorption of styrene [14]. Curves such as those reported in Fig. 1 are quite general for the catalytic hydrogenation of alkynes [15]. Figure 1 also shows that phenylacetylene hydrogenation over Pt/C displays a very good linear trend of plots of percent conversion vs. time, indicating that the reaction occurs with a kinetic law of pseudo-zero order with respect to the substrate. Experimental runs carried out with different amounts of catalyst have shown that the catalytic activity varies linearly with the weight of the catalyst and the selectivity remains unchanged. This, together with the experiments carried out at different stirring conditions, indicates that under the operative conditions used the reaction is under kinetic control. Figure 2 shows the results obtained during the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene on Pt/nylon. On this sample the initial rate of reaction is lower than that measured on Pt/C (6.8 X 10-5 mol s~1 (g Pt)~1 on Pt/nylon against 3.0 X 10~4 mol s~1 (g Pt)~1 on the Pt/C sample). Moreover, it is noted that on the polymer-supported sample the order of reaction is not zero, and a fractionary order (ssO.4) has been measured. A lower hydrogena- tion activity of noble metals supported on polyamide matrix has been pre- viously reported and attributed to an electronic interaction between the metal and the support [16]. On the bimetallic Pt Sn/nylon samples, the order of reaction is similar to that observed on Pt/nylon but the rate of reaction decreases on addition of tin (Fig. 3). Samples having a Sn/Pt ratio higher than 1 are practically inactive. Such a behaviour resembles that found in the gas phase hydro- 369 \"TOO150200S6300350~ Time(min) Fig. 2.

A similar effect of tin on the catalytic activity of platinum has been reported by Leclercq et al. [18] in the hydrogenation of benzene and in the hydro- genolysis of cyclopentane and butane. The influence of addition of tin on the selectivity towards styrene is reported in Fig. 4. The presence of tin causes a slight decrease in the styrene 370 100 {J40 o 01 20. \"IDao3640s5eB75no\" 100 Sr^ Sn.Pt) Fig. 4. Selectivity to styrene (styrene/(styrene+ethylbenzene) measured at 15% conver- sion) as a function of Sn content; T = 283 K. selectivity which, however, remains almost unchanged on all bimetallic samples. Hydrocinnamaldehyde The hydrogenation of hydrocinnamaldehyde was carried out under experimental conditions similar to those used for the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene. Under these conditions hydrocinnamaldehyde diethylacetal is readily formed through the reaction between the substrate and ethanol used as solvent. This is in agreement with previous results [12]. The only hydrogenated product observed was phenylpropanol, which is obtained by addition of hydrogen to the carbonyl group. No other products were de- tected in the reaction mixture. On the Pt/nylon sample, as well on Pt/C, the rate of hydrogenation (measured from the amount of alcohol formed) was negligible, and after 5 h the aldehyde conversion was less than 2%. Figure 5 shows the conversion of hydrocinnamaldehyde to phenyl- propanol as a function of time on different Pt Sn catalysts. Over the entire range of conversion measured, the order of reaction with respect to the sub- strate is zero regardless of the amount of tin present in the sample. In order to compare the activities of the different Pt-Sn catalysts, we report in Fig. 6 the pseudo-zero order rate constants (expressed per gram of platinum) as a function of the tin content. The presence of small amounts of tin increases drastically the reaction rate, which reaches a maximum for a tin content of about 10%. At higher percentages of tin the rate decreases. Samples having a tin content higher than 70% are practically inactive. Discussion The results reported in the previous section clearly show that the effect of tin on catalytic hydrogenations over platinum is strongly dependent on 371 Fig. 5.

In the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, addition of tin causes a sharp decrease in the rate of reaction, which becomes practically zero for Sn/Pt ratios higher than 1 (Fig. 3). In the hydrogenation of the C=0 group, an increase is observed at lower tin contents with a subsequent decrease at the higher Sn/Pt ratios (Fig. 6). The catalytic activity decline observed on the Pt Sn/nylon samples during phenylacetylene hydrogenation is similar to that previously reported for the hydrogenation of propene in the gas phase [17]. On the other hand, the results of the hydrocinnamaldehyde reduction closely resemble those found on the hydrogenation of a, ^-unsaturated aldehydes to the corre- sponding unsaturated alcohols [12]. This indicates that addition of tin has a two-fold effect on the catalytic behaviour of platinum. One effect is to deactivate the platinum sites for the addition of hydrogen to multiple carbon-carbon bonds. The other effect is to activate the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group. It is already known that metallic ions which poison platinum metal catalysts in the hydrogenation of unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds can act as promoters in the catalytic reduction of aldehydes and ketones over pla- tinum oxide. In particular, it has been reported that addition of small quantities of various metallic chlorides to platinum oxide as well as to Pt/C 372 S.zoo a -\" JB 100 ~Sa4060 100 Sn/ISn + Pt) Fig. 6. Pseudo-zero order rate constant for hydrocinnamaldehyde hydrogenation as a function of Sn content; T = 283 K. or Ru/C increases the rate of hydrogenation of the carbonyl group [19 - 24]. Stannous chloride has been shown to have the highest promoting power [23, 24]. It has been suggested that promoters inhibit the reduction of active platinum oxide to an inactive platinum of lower oxidation state. This, while in agreement with previous experimental observations that inactive platinum catalysts can be readly activated by shaking the reaction mixture with oxygen [25], is not supported by the chemico-physical characterization performed on our Pt Sn samples [26, 27]. An X-ray study carried out by using WAXS (wide-angle X-ray scat- tering) and SAXS (small-angle X-ray scattering) techniques has evidenced than on all Pt Sn samples (after a hydrogen pretreatment at 343 K in an ethanol slurry) the noble metal is in the metallic state with its proper f.c.c. structure [26]. Addition of tin leads to a decrease in the platinum particle size from about 100 A on the monometallic sample up to about 30 A on the catalyst having a Pt/Sn ratio equal to 2/3. Moreover, the evaluation of the lattice parameters of platinum has shown a systematic expansion of the platinum lattice from 3.923 A on Pt/nylon up to 3.954 A on the sample with the higher percentage of tin. This has been related to the formation of a solid solution of Sn in Pt. Neither platinum oxide nor crystalline Sn were detected by X-ray. It should be also noted that no significant variations have been found on the catalysts after reaction. The existence of Pt/Sn alloy in Pt Sn/AlaOa catalysts has been reported by Bacaud et al. [28]. 373 Formation of metallic platinum after reduction and the absence of isolated metallic tin has been also confirmed by an ESCA study performed on the same samples before and after reduction and after reaction [27]. The larger platinum surface area found by X-ray on the bimetallic samples cannot, however, justify either the very large increase in the cata- lytic activity found at lower tin content during aldehyde reduction, or the decrease found at the higher Sn/Pt ratios. Runs carried out using mono- metallic platinum samples with different metal particle size have shown no drastic change in the specific catalytic activity, ruling out the possibility that our results are influenced by a structure-sensitive nature of the reaction investigated. It can be therefore suggested (as previously reported [12]) that the effect of tin on the catalytic hydrogenation of aldehydes is related to the presence on the catalyst surface of electrophilic Sn ions which activate the carbonyl group by increasing the polarization of the C==0 bond. H p^(6+)_^(6-) _ _ ^ 0^=0 I - - -^ Sn\"4- CH; R Under these conditions the C==0 group becomes more reactive towards the attack of a weak nucleophilic agent, as the chemisorbed hydrogen (Hg) can be considered. The curve shape observed in the rate of hydrocmnamaldehyde hydro- genation (Fig. 6) is likely to be related to a change in the rate-determining step. At low tin content, the rate of reaction is controlled by the reactivity of the C=0 group (which is enhanced by the presence of tin), while at higher tin content platinum is poisoned and the addition of hydrogen becomes rate- determining. This is in agreement with the strong decline observed in the rate of hydrogenation of phenylacetylene and with the almost constant selecti- vity observed in this reaction at all Pt/Sn ratios (Figs. 3 and 4). In order to explain the deactivation of platinum, in principle, it may be suggested that tin eventually covers the platinum surface, reducing the number of active sites. This is in agreement with the tendency of platinum- tin alloys to have a tin-rich surface [29, 30]. The quantitative surface anal- ysis carried out by ESCA has not however evidenced an enrichment on our catalyst surface [27]. Therefore the poisoning of platinum cannot be simply ascribed to a physical block of the active sites. In making this conclusion,' however, it should be taken into account that the ESCA analysis gives infor- mation which is not limited to the first monolayer but is an average compo- sition of the first 20 - 30 A. A second hypothesis relates instead the deactivation of platinum to an electronic interaction occurring between metallic platinum and tin. Such an interaction can occur either with tin ions and/or through the formation of a solid solution (as evidenced by the X-ray investigation [26]). An electronic modification of platinum by tin has been also suggested to explain the cata- lytic behaviour of the Pt Sn system in the reforming reaction [4]. 374 On the basis of the above considerations, it can be suggested that the presence of tin in our reaction system has several effects. First of all, it causes a decrease in the platinum particle size, slowing down the rate of migration and growth of the small metal crystallites formed during the re- duction stage. A similar effect has been also reported for the Pt Sn/AlaOa system [31]. The increase in the metal surface area is, however, offset by a second effect which is linked with an electronic interaction with the noble metal leading to a deactivation of the platinum active sites. This occurs either by interaction with tin ions and/or by formation of a solid solution. A decrease in the number of active sites can however also occur through a dilution of the platinum metal atoms which leads to smaller ensembles having lower activity [18]. A third effect of tin is related to its interaction with the substrate. The electrophilic nature of tin ions increases the polar- ization of the C=0 bond, facilitating the attack of a weak nucleophilic agent, as the chemisorbed hydrogen can be considered.

In the hydrogénation of the CO group, an increase is instead observed at lower tin contents with a subsequent decrease at the higher Sn/Pt ratios. These results are discussed in terms of: (a) an interaction between tin and platinum which deactivates the active metal sites and (b) an interaction between hydrocinnamaldehyde and tin ions which enhances the reactivity of the CO group.
