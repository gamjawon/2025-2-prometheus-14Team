(+81-48)4624668 (Received October 22, 1992; accepted January 16, 1993 ) Abstract The trinuclear ruthenium complexes, Ru-red ([ (NH3) 5Ru-0-Ru (NH3) 4-0-Ru (NH3) 5 ] 6+ represented as RuI\"-Ruiv-RuI`I) and Ru-brown ( [ (NH3)5Ru-0-Ru(NH3)4-0-Ru(NH3)5]'+, represented as RuIv-Ru\"i-Ruiv) were studied as water oxidation catalysts in a homogeneous aqueous solution as well as in a Nafion membrane incorporated system under different pH conditions using in situ spectrocyclic voltammetry. The in situ absorption spectra recorded for the trimer ruthenium complexes in homogeneous solution showed that the Ru-red undergoes oxidation initially to form the Ru-brown complex at pH 7.4. Independent of pH conditions, the Rubrown formed in homogeneous solution underwent oxidation to produce a higher oxidation state complex. This higher oxidation state complex was reduced by water molecules to liberate dioxygen with the formation of Ru-brown; however, the Ru-brown underwent decomposition in a homogeneous solution. The Ru-red complex adsorbed into a Nafion membrane underwent oxidation to form Ru-brown initially and further oxidation to give a higher oxidation state complex. This higher oxidation state complex was readily reduced by water molecules and turned back to Rubrown without decomposition. The complexes were remarkably stabilized as water oxidation catalyst when incorporated in a Nafion membrane. Key words: Nafion; Ru-brown complex; Ru-red complex; spectrocyclic voltammetry; water oxidation Introduction Water oxidation is an important research topic which is not only relevant to photosynthesis but also to solar energy conversion [ 1-3 ] . The main difficulty in achieving a model water oxidation center lies in the four-electron oxidation of two water molecules (eqn.1). In the oxygen evolving center (OEC ) for 'Corresponding author. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved. 320 R. Rarnaraj and M. Kaneho/J. Mol. Catal. 81 (1993) 319-332 2H20-*OZ +4H++4e- (1) photosynthesis, more than two Mn ions form a protein complex, which couples the four-electron water oxidation with photoexcitation. Oxygen is evolved during photosynthesis in a heterogeneous phase of the Mn protein. One important role of the protein must be to stabilize the highly oxidized state of the catalyst which otherwise would oxidize organic moieties present nearby instead of the water molecules. To achieve the four-electron water oxidation, one approach is to design a catalyst in a condensed phase such as polymer membrane [ 4,5 ] . Our continuing effort is to design a model system where the involvement of more than one or two metal centers leads to the formation of an active multielectron transfer site in a membrane system rather than in a homogeneous solution. In artificial photosynthesis, attempts are currently being made to design molecular units that mimic the function of the oxygen evolving complex [ 5 ] . It has already been shown that the trinuclear ruthenium complexes, Ru-red and Ru-brown, act as four-electron water oxidation catalysts to evolve dioxygen [ 6-8 ] . However, these catalysts undergo decomposition during water oxidation in a homogeneous solution [ 7,9 ] upon oxidation by CeIv ions used as oxidant. In situ spectrocyclic voltammetry is an effective method to study the transformation of metal complexes in redox reactions both in homogeneous solution and in membrane systems [ 10,11 ] . In the present work, we have found that the trimer complexes, Ru-red and Ru-brown, are highly stabilized when adsorbed into a Nafion membrane, in marked contrast to those in homogeneous solution, and we report here on the water oxidation membrane system. Experimental Materials The di-y-oxo-bridged trinuclear ruthenium complex, Ru-red ([ (NH3) 5RuO-Ru (NH3) 4-O-Ru (NH3) 5 ] 6+ ), was purchased from Wako. Ru-brown ( [ (NH3) SRu-O-Ru (NH3) 4-O-Ru (NH3) 5 ]'+ ) was prepared from Ru-red by the published procedure [7,12]. Since the Ru-red complex undergoes photodecomposition, the preparation and storage of samples were always carried out in the dark. A 5% Nafion solution (Aldrich) was diluted to 2.5% with methanol before use. Methods The Nafion coated ITO (indium tin oxide) electrode was prepared by casting 8 ,ul of a 2.5% Nafion solution on an ITO glass plate, and dried under room temperature to give a film thickness of 0.8 ,Cm. The Nafion coated ITO electrode was dipped in distilled water for 1 h to improve the properties of the film [ 10 ] , and then dipped into a solution containing 2 mM Ru-red or Ru- R. Ramaraj and M. Kaneko/J. Mol. Catal. 81 (1993) 319-332 321 brown for 15 min. After the adsorption of the complex, the electrode was washed and kept in distilled water before use (represented as ITO/Nf/Ru-red or Rubrown). In the case of thin layer ITO cell, the cell was constructed using two ITO plates (area 2.6 cm2) kept parallel to each other with a 0.3 mm thick spacer between them, and a platinum wire and a silver wire were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The potential of the Ag wire was 0.19 V us. SCE. The Ag wire was washed with ammonia solution before each experiment. The cyclic voltammograms were run using Hokuto Denko potentiostat/galvanostat HA 301, a HB 104 function generator. The absorption spectra were recorded in situ during the potential sweep using an Otsuka Electronics IMUC-7000 diode array multichannel detection system. The electrochemical cell used for in situ spectrocyclic voltammetric studies on the membrane system was a quartz cell (1 X 1 cm, height 6.5 cm) equipped with a Nafion coated ITO glass plate as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. Nitric acid or phosphate buffer were used as supporting electrolytes for the cyclic voltammetric studies. The solutions for spectrocyclic voltammetric studies were purged with argon gas by bubbling it through for 25 min before each experiment. Results and discussion The visible absorption spectrum recorded for Ru-red in an aqueous solution at different acid concentrations are shown in Fig. 1. Ru-red shows an intense absorption peak at 535 nm [ 12 ] .

Catal. 81 (1993) 319-332 sorption maximum at 465 nm [7,12] (Fig. 1). It was also found that the presence of anions such as Cl-, N03 and S04- induced the slow formation of Rubrown. An increase in the temperature enhanced the rate of Ru-brown formation. Very similar spectral changes were observed for the Nafion membrane adsorbed Ru-red complex. The one-electron oxidation and reduction of Ru-red and Ru-brown has already been well studied [7,12,13] (eqn. 2). RuIII-Ru'v-RuIII Rulv-RuIII-Rulv Ru-red (in neutral or alkaline solution) te- Ru-brown (in acidic solution) It was also reported that there is no major structural difference between the Ru-red and Ru-brown complexes [ 12-14 ] . We have reported on the electrochemistry of these trimer complexes [6,7]. The Ru-red complex, RuIII-Ru'vRuIII, undergoes five step oxidations to produce Ruv-Ruv-Ruv. The catalysed water oxidation to evolve dioxygen by Ru-red and Ru-brown has also been reported [ 6-8 ] . The cyclic voltammogram recorded for Ru-red at pH 7.4 (in phosphate buffer) using a thin layer ITO cell at a scan rate of 5 mV s-I is shown in Fig. 2. The cyclic voltammogram shows large anodic current at higher positive potentials probably due to water oxidation at this pH condition catalysed by the higher oxidation state ruthenium complex. In the reverse scan the cyclic voltammogram shows only a small reduction wave due to the reduction of the higher oxidation state ruthenium complex by water molecules. The in situ spectrocyclic voltammetric studies were carried out with Ru-red at pH 7.4 using the thin layer ITO cell, at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1.

In the potential scan from -0.1 to 0.32 V vs. Ag, the absorbance at 535 nm decreases with simultaneous increase in the absorbance at 470 nm, and an isosbestic point is evident at 490 nm (Fig. 3A). The decrease in absorbance at 535 nm is attributed to the oxidation of Ru-red (Ruin-Ruiv-Run,) and the increase in absorbance at 470 nm to the formation of Ru-brown (RuIv-RuIrrRuIv) [ 7,12,13 ] . When the applied potential is increased to above 0.32 V vs. Ag, the absorbances at 470 and 535 nm start decreasing and the bands disappear completely when the potential reaches 1.0 V vs. Ag (Fig. 3B) .

Catal. 81 (1993) 319-332 verse scan from 1.0 to -0.1 V us. Ag, the absorbance does not recover (Fig. 3B). This indicates that the higher oxidation state trimer decomposes in a homogeneous solution at pH 7.4 probably leading to the formation of mononuclear ruthenium complexes. The cyclic voltammogram recorded for Ru-brown using the thin layer ITO cell in a 0.5 M HN03 solution with a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 is shown in Fig. 4. In the potential range from 0.5 to 1.0 V Us. Ag, the cyclic voltammogram shows indistinguishable oxidation waves accompanied by catalytic current at higher positive potentials (Fig. 4) . During the reverse scan in the potential range from 0.5 to - 0.1 V us. Ag, a reduction wave is observed at about 0.5 V us. Ag showing the reduction of Ru-brown to Ru-red. The higher oxidation state Ruv-RuvRuv formed at higher positive potentials during oxidation would probably be reduced by water molecules to produce Ru-brown [6,7] and the reduction of Ru-brown appears to occur in the potential region from 0.5 to -0.1 V us. Ag. The in situ absorption spectra recorded during the cyclic voltammetry scan for Ru-brown in 0.6 M HN03 are shown in Fig. 5. The absorption spectra recorded in the potential range from 0.5 to 1.0 V us. Ag show a decrease in the absorbance in the 470 nm band due to the oxidation of Ru-brown (RuIv-Ruin-Ruiv) . In the reverse scan, there is a further decrease in the absorbance at 470 nm band (Fig. 5A). In the potential range from 0.5 to -0.1 V us. Ag, there was an increase in the absorbance at 535 nm and a corresponding decrease in the absorbance at 470 nm with an isosbestic point at 500 nm (Fig. 5B ). An increase in the absorbance of the 535 nm band was observed also in the potential range from -0.1 to 0.0 V us. Ag. This increase is attributed to the reduction of Rubrown (RuIv-Ruin-Rurv) to Ru-red (Ruin-Rurv-Rurii ) [ 7,12 ] . In the oxidative scan from 0.0 to 0.5 V us. Ag, the absorbance at 535 nm decreases and the absorbance at 470 nm (Fig. 5C ), increases, which is attributable to the oxidation of Ru-red to Ru-brown. The absorbance at 470 nm does not return to its original value (Fig. 5A and 5B ), indicating partial decomposition of the trimer complex during the voltammetric scan. 20uA I 0 -0.1 0.2 0.5 0.8 1.0 E / V vs.Ag Fig. 4.

Catal. 81 (1993) 319-332 325 The in situ spectrocyclic voltammetry studies of Ru-red and Ru-brown under alkaline and acidic conditions show that Ru-brown is comparatively stable upon oxidation. This may be due to the stabilization of Ru-brown (Ru'vRuIII-Rulv) by charge delocalization [ 12-14 ] . Under potentiostatic conditions, the in situ spectrocyclic voltammetric studies were carried out using a thin layer ITO cell under alkaline and acidic conditions. The changes in the absorption spectra observed for Ru-red at an applied potential of 1.0 V vs. Ag at pH 7.4 are shown in Fig. 6. There is a decrease in the absorbance at 535 nm and an increase in the absorbance at 470 nm (Fig. 6A). After 125 s, the absorbances at 470 and 535 nm have almost disappeared (Fig. 6B). This observation is very similar to that one observed for Ru-red in the thin layer spectrocyclic voltammetric studies (Fig. 3). The Ru-red (RuIII-Ru'v-R0I) first undergoes oxidation to Ru-brown (Rulv-RulIIRulv) and then in a subsequent oxidation process the higher oxidation state Ruv-Ruv-Ruv complex results. This Ruv-Ruv-Ruv is probably reduced by water molecules to form Ru-brown, and during this process, this complex might undergo decomposition yielding monomeric ruthenium ammine complexes. Very similar spectral changes were also observed for the Ru-brown solution (0.5 M HN03) in the controlled potential electrolysis at 1.0 V vs. Ag as shown in Fig. 7. The absorbance at 470 nm due to Ru-brown decreased upon electrolysis, and within 325 s the absorption had completely disappeared. Unlike Rured at pH 7.4, Ru-brown undergoes rather slow decomposition under acidic conditions. This observation is consistent with the partial stability under acidic conditions as shown in the in situ spectrocyclic voltammetric studies (Fig. 5 ). Such stabilization would be due to charge delocalization in Ru-brown (RulvRuIII-Rulv) as mentioned already. The cyclic voltammogram recorded for ITO/Nf/Ru-red at pH 7.4 (phosphate buffer) at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s-1 is shown in Fig. 8. A lower scan rate of 0.5 mV s-1 was employed in the case of Nafion coated ITO electrodes than in homogeneous solution. At this scan rate, the Ru-red and Ru-brown in homogeneous solution undergo rapid decomposition as shown by the in situ absorption spectra. The in situ absorption spectra recorded at ITO/NF/Ru-red during the scan from 0.5 to 1.5 V vs. SCE at pH 7.4 are shown in Fig. 9. The absorption spectral changes show a decrease in the absorbance at 540 nm accompanied by a simultaneous increase in the absorbance at 470 nm, and an isosbestic point is found at 490 nm. The decrease in absorbance at 540 nm is attributed to the oxidation of Ru-red (RuIII-Ru1v-RunI) and the increase in absorbance at 470 nm to the formation of Ru-brown (RuIv-Rulu-Rulv) . During the reverse scan in the potential range from 1.4 to 1.2 V vs. SCE, Ru-red still underwent oxidation to a small extent as shown by the increase in absorbance in the 470 nm band. In the potential range from 1.2 to 0.5 V vs. SCE, the absorption spectra showed no change in the absorbance, showing the remarkable stability of the trimer ruthenium complex in a membrane. These results suggest that initially Ru-red undergoes one-electron oxidation to give Ru- 326 -0 0.2 o 0.0 0.4 0.2 o h a m 0.0 1 0.4 c m - 0.2 o N 0.0 R. Ramaraj and M. Kaneko/J. Mol.

Gas bubbles were observed on the Na%on film during the anodic scan to 1.4 V vs. SCE and also under potentiostatic conditions at 1.35 V vs. SCE both under acidic and alkaline conditions; the gas was identified as oxygen by gas chromatography. The in situ spectrocyclic voltammetric studies were repeated at least three R. Ramaraj and M. Kaneko/J. Mol. Catal. 81 (1993) 319-332 331 times for each experiment to confirm the reproducibility. The in situ spectral data in a homogeneous solution under different pH conditions show initial formation of Ru-brown from Ru-red, and at higher positive potentials further oxidation of Ru-brown leads to its decomposition in addition to the catalytic water oxidation process. However, the in situ spectrocyclic voltammetric data in a Nafion membrane system under different pH conditions clearly show the formation of Ru-brown initially, and at higher positive potentials, further changes in the absorption spectra changes aIe not observed. The reactions observed at ITO/Nf/Ru-red or Ru-brown at different pH values by in situ absorption spectroscopy are summarised in Scheme 1. The above studies indicate that in the cyclic catalysed water oxidation reaction the trimer ruthenium complex adsorbed on to the Nafion membrane acts as four-electron catalyst, independently of pH, and the complex is stabilized against decomposition in the membrane. The trinuclear ruthenium complex adsorbed on to the Nafion membrane is probably present in a microheterogeneous environment imposed by the hydrophobic fluorocarbon moiety and aqueous hydrophilic sulfonate ion cluster, and the trimer complex ion is probably electrostatically held by the sulfonate ions. In a polymer membrane, the metal complex molecules would be isolated and the microheterogeneous environment alters the complex-solvent interaction. Such effects are well documented for macromolecular metal complexes [4,5 ] . Since these water oxidation catalysts are strong oxidants in their higher oxidation states, they would attack organic ligands of other complex molecules in a homogeneous solution, and the reaction products would be solvated and stabilized by water molecules. However, such a degradative oxidation is probably prevented by the microheterogeneous environment imposed by the polymer membrane on the isolated metal complex entities. The water oxidation catalyst confined in a membrane is of great importance in relation to the water oxidation site in the photosynthetic membrane RuIV-RuIII_RuIV Ru-broO 470 nm RuIII_RuIV-RuIII rapid RuV_RuV-RuV Ru-red \\ not detected 535 nm 02 + 4 H+ 2\"20 Scheme 1.

Catal. 81 (1993) 319-332 system. Water oxidation in the oxygen evolving center is understood to be realized by the enzymatic organization of a special Mn cluster in a protein environment [ 1,2 ] . It has already been suggested that the microheterogeneous environment around the Mn centers and the close proximity of the manganese centers to one another are important for water oxidation in the photosynthetic oxygen evolving complex (OEC). The present work not only demonstrates the realization of an efficient four-electron water oxidation system utilizing a polymer membrane, but also shows the remarkable stabilization of the water oxidation catalysts against decomposition in a membrane.

The in situ absorption spectra recorded for the trimer ruthenium complexes in homogeneous solution showed that the Ru-red undergoes oxidation initially to form the Ru-brown complex at pH 7.4. Independent of pH conditions, the Ru-brown formed in homogeneous solution underwent oxidation to produce a higher oxidation state complex. This higher oxidation state complex was reduced by water molecules to liberate dioxygen with the formation of Ru-brown; however, the Ru-brown underwent decomposition in a homogeneous solution. The Ru-red complex adsorbed into a Nafion membrane underwent oxidation to form Ru-brown initially and further oxidation to give a higher oxidation state complex. This higher oxidation state complex was readily reduced by water molecules and turned back to Ru-brown without decomposition.
