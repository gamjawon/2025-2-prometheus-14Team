Lyngby, Denmark ⁎ Corresponding author. 1 Current address: Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion, Stiftstr. 34, 45470 Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany Oxidation of biomass-derived furfural with hydrogen peroxide provides a sustainable path to 1,4-diacids for polymer production. The state-of-the-art catalyst, titanium silicate (TS-1), suffers from drawbacks including deactivation and diffusion limitations, but its catalytic activity can be improved by introducing mesoporosity and metal species. Herein, hierarchical TS-1 (HTS-1) catalysts loaded with different metal oxides were prepared and examined for furfural oxidation with aqueous hydrogen peroxide. HTS-1 loaded with Ni (Ni/HTS-1) yielded 32 % maleic acid from furfural under screening conditions, which was 28 % higher relative yield than unloaded HTS-1 under the same conditions. Catalyst characterization and an in situ 13C NMR study elucidated the promotional role of Ni and the pathway, by which the reaction proceeds. Surprisingly, the NMR study indicated that the reactions using both Ni/HTS-1 and unloaded HTS-1 proceed via formation of furfural peroxide followed by Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, and not via epoxidation as many other TS-1 catalyzed oxidations.

The market for green plastics and other chemicals sourced from biomass is growing [1]. Furfural is currently produced from lignocellulosic biomass by acid catalysis and is a platform chemical, from which several C5 and C4 value-added chemicals can be derived. Among the possible chemicals, the 1,4-diacids maleic acid (MA) and succinic acid (SA) can be formed by oxidation of furfural and are of particular interest, as they are precursors for large-scale polymer production [2–4]. The selective oxidation of furfural with high atom economy is key to making the production of diacids from furfural economically viable. Several heterogeneous catalytic systems, including various sulphonic acid resins [5,6] as well as niobium-, tin- and titanium-based catalysts [7–13] have been applied for furfural oxidation in aqueous solution using oxygen or peroxides as oxidants with good yields. Titanium silicate-1 (TS-1) zeolite is a widely used heterogeneous catalyst for (ep)oxidation of organic reactants and is also the state-of-the-art catalyst for furfural oxidation with hydrogen peroxide, yielding up to 78 % MA [7]. The isolated tetrahedral Ti sites within the zeolite framework provide high catalytic activity and product selectivity. However, the microporous structure of the catalyst induces diffusion limitations, imposing a requirement for a large excess of hydrogen peroxide to sustain high catalytic activity. Similar challenges for other TS-1 catalyzed oxidation reactions have been addressed by tailoring the properties of TS-1, such as hydrophobicity, pore size, and active sites [14–17]. Hence, it was found that hierarchical TS-1 (HTS-1) improved the MA yield in the furfural oxidation by reducing diffusion limitations through the introduced mesoporosity and increased hydrophobicity [8]. Improved catalytic performance of TS-1 catalysts for epoxidation [18–22], hydroxylation [23,24], hydrodeoxygenation [25], and ammoxidation [26] of organic compounds have been achieved by tuning the electronic properties of the catalysts by introduction of a second metal species as a promotor. Notably, modification of TS-1 catalysts with nickel oxide increases the electrophilicity of the active Ti sites resulting in increased catalytic activity for several types of oxidations [21,26,27]. Despite extensive research, the mechanistic details of the furfural oxidation reaction in aqueous solution with heterogeneous catalysts (including TS-1) and hydrogen peroxide are not yet fully understood. The different pathways proposed in the literature for furfural oxidation with aqueous hydrogen peroxide are summarized in Scheme 1. Pathways I and II suggest oxidation of furfural to furoic acid, followed by furan epoxidation yielding 5-hydroxy-2(5 H)-furanone (5HFO), which is oxidized to MA [28,29]. Wahlen et al. proposed that the catalyzed oxidation of furan derivatives and furfuryl alcohol with TS-1 and hydrogen peroxide occurs via epoxidation and subsequent formation of 1,4-dicarbonyl intermediates [30]. Based on these findings, pathway III was proposed [7], where epoxidation of the furan ring is followed by Baeyer-Villiger oxidation and hydrolysis yielding the intermediate 5HFO and MA as the product. Recently, the intermediate (Z)-4-oxopent-2-enedial (4O2EL) was proposed as an intermediate in a TS-1 catalyzed furfural oxidation [31]. Pathways IV and V were proposed by Kul’nevich et al. providing an explanation to the observed co-production of SA and MA acid in many catalyst systems [32]. The shift in distribution between the lactones and 2-hydroxyfuran was suggested to govern the product distribution. Pathway V was also confirmed as the main route for SA production over sulfonic acid catalysts [5,6,33] and the Lewis acid catalyst Sn-Beta [12]. Pathways IV and V were recently proposed as mechanism for homogenously Brønsted acid catalyzed furfural oxidation and substantiated by an extensive in situ 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic study [34]. In this work, the promotional effects of loading HTS-1 with abundant transition metal oxides for furfural oxidation with aqueous hydrogen peroxide were initially examined. Based on previous studies [21,26,27], we hypothesized that especially Ni loading on the HTS-1 catalyst may increase catalytic activity. Additionally, ex situ and in situ NMR methods were combined to study intermediates and mechanistic details of the heterogeneously catalyzed furfural oxidation, and to determine the influence of metal loading on the reaction pathways. Overall, this in situ study of HTS-1 catalyzed furfural oxidation sought to provide insights into the reaction pathway that permit future catalyst optimization. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Titanium silicate (TS-1, Type A) was purchased from ACS Material. Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 1 M), nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate (98 %), cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (≥98 %), iron(II) acetate (95 %), manganese(II) acetate tetrahydrate (≥99 %), zinc acetate dihydrate (≥99 %), copper(II) acetate monohydrate (98 %), zirconium acetate in acetic acid solution (15–17 wt%), furfural (99 %), maleic acid (MA, ≥99 %), L-(-)malic acid (MAc, 97 %) and deuterium oxide (D2O, 99.9 atom% D) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Hydrogen peroxide solution (30 wt%, Fischer), succinic acid (SA, ≥99 %, BHD), formic acid (≥99 %, VWR), 5-hydroxy-2,5-dihydrofuran-2-one (5HFO, 95 %, Enamine), and malonic acid (MaloA, >98 %, Fluka) were purchased from other sources. All reagents were used without further purification. 2.2 Catalyst syntheses A previously reported post-synthetic method was used to synthesize hierarchical TS-1 (HTS-1) [36]. TS-1 (10 g) was mixed with a TPAOH solution (40 mL, 0.15 M) and the solution was transferred to an autoclave, where a dissolution-recrystallization process was carried out under autogenous pressure for 24 h at 150 °C. Subsequently, incipient-wetness impregnation was used to synthesize the M/HTS-1 (M = Ni, Zn, Cu, Fe, Co, Zr, Mn) catalysts, using 1 wt% metal in aqueous solutions (0.45 mL per 0.7 g HTS-1) of the respective metal salts. The resulting powdered catalysts were dried in static air for 18 h before being calcined at 600 °C for 6 h. 2.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was measured at 2θ angles of 3.5–90° using an Empyrean X-ray Diffractometer from PANalytical equipped with a CuKα radiation source (λ = 1.54 Å). Nitrogen physisorption was measured at 77 K (–196 °C) at relative pressures of 0.01–0.99 with a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 instrument after degassing the samples for 4 h at 250 °C. The surface area was determined by BET theory and the micropores volume was estimated by the t-plot method. The total pore volume and average pore size was determined by BJH analysis of adsorption data. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were measured using a Tecnai T20 G2 microscope, operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Samples were prepared by dispersing the powders in ethanol using ultrasonication and placing two droplets of the solution on a carbon coated copper grid. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured ex situ at room temperature with a Thermo Fisher Scientific instrument equipped with a AlKα radiation source. A spot size of 400 μm was used and sample charging effects were reduced by using a flood gun. Recorded spectra were corrected by setting the C 1 s binding energy to 284.8 eV. Data analysis was performed using the Thermo Fisher Scientific Avantage software version 6.9.0. Ti 2p spectra were deconvoluted into two peaks (30 % Lorentzian, 70 % Gaussian) with unconstrained binding energies and FWHMs constrained to the range 0.5–3.5 eV. The Powell fitting algorithm with a convergence level of 10−8 and smart backgrounds were used. Molar surface Ti/Si and Ni/Si ratios were determined by comparing the respective ratios of A/SF, with A being the area under the XPS signal curve (smart background) and SF being the sensitivity factor of the 2p orbital as provided in the ALTHERM01 library embedded in the software. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) was measured on a Micrometrics Autochem II 2920 instrument equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). After pretreating the samples (0.1 g) by heating to 600 °C (10 °C/min) followed by cooling under He gas (25 mL/min), the samples were flushed with 1 % NH3/He (NH3-TPD) or 100 % CO2 (CO2-TPD) gas mixtures (25 mL/min) at 100 or 50 °C, respectively, for 1 h and then purged with He for 1 h. Desorption was measured upon heating to 600 °C (10 °C/min) under He gas (25 mL/min). The content of Ti and Ni metal in samples was determined by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) analysis measured on a PANalytical εpsilon3-XL instrument. The samples were fused into disks before analysis using a Claisse LeNeo fluxer oven. Due to the small amount of spent catalyst available, EDXRF of these samples were measured in powder form and compared to fresh catalysts measured in the same way. 2.4 Catalyst tests Tests of catalyst performance were conducted in ACE® (15 mL) pressure tubes. Powdered catalyst (50 mg), furfural (1 mmol), H2O2 solution, and Milli-Q water were added to the tube with amounts adjusted to specific ratios while keeping a constant reaction solution volume (5 mL). The tubes were placed in an aluminium block that was preheated to 50 °C. After the desired reaction time, the reaction was quenched by rapid cooling to room temperature in an icebath. Then, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was filtered (0.45 µm filter) to remove the catalyst. Samples for NMR analysis were prepared with the filtered reaction mixture (450 µL) and D2O (50 µL). Samples for high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis were prepared with filtered reaction mixture (100 µL) diluted in 5 mM H2SO4. Samples were stored in a freezer at −18 °C, if immediate analysis was not possible. Quantitative sample analysis by HPLC was conducted on an Agilent 1200 instrument equipped with an inline degasser, a refractive index detector and a Bio-Rad Aminex-HPX-87H column (300 ×7.8 mm). The best product separation (representative HPLC chromatogram in SI, Figure S1) was obtained with a mobile phase (5 mM H2SO4) flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and a column temperature of 30 °C. Spent catalysts were isolated for further analysis by centrifugation and washed with water and acetone. 2.5 NMR analysis and experiments Samples were analyzed qualitatively by 13C NMR spectroscopy using spectra acquired with a Bruker Avance III HD 800 MHz spectrometer, equipped with a TCI cryoprobe and 18.7 T Oxford Magnet. Assignments were validated using 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) and 1H-13C heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) as well as reference spectra of furfural (FF), maleic acid, malic acid, succinic acid, formic acid, 5-hydroxy-2,5-dihydrofuran-2-one, and malonic acid in addition to comparison to previously reported chemical shifts [34]. Selected reactions were also monitored in situ by 13C NMR spectroscopy using solutions prepared in smaller scale in an NMR tube, mimicking the conditions used for the catalytic tests (see Section 2.3). The catalyst (0.6 mg), furfural (0.12 mmol,10 μL) and D2O (300 μL) were added into a 5 mm NMR tube fitted with a stopper with a hole for pressure release. The reaction was started by the addition of H2O2 (180 μL), and the first NMR spectrum was recorded 5 min after the addition. All spectra were acquired at 50 °C using Bruker Topspin software and were analyzed in the same software. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Promotional effects of Ni in the M/HTS-1 catalysts First, hierarchical TS-1 was synthesized by the dissolution-recrystallization method. Formation of HTS-1 was confirmed by N2 physisorption showing increased mesopore volume and a type IV isotherm with H4 hysteresis loop (SI, Figure S2) [37,38], and XRD showed that the MFI structure [39,40] of the zeolite was intact (SI, Figure S3). Furthermore, after incipient wetness impregnation with transition metal oxides (1 wt%), the high surface area of the catalysts was retained (SI, Table S1), and an apparently good dispersion of the metal oxides was inferred from the absence of additional peaks in the diffractograms (SI, Figure S4). Next, the activities of the synthesized M/HTS-1 (M = Ni, Zn, Cu, Fe, Co, Zr, Mn) catalysts were evaluated at various conditions and were compared to the activity of the unloaded HTS-1 catalyst ( Fig. 1). The choice of reaction conditions was based on previous literature [7–12] showing that a moderate excess of hydrogen peroxide (6 equiv.) leads to maleic acid formation (3 equiv. required). While a TS-1/furfural w/w ratio of 1 has been shown to be beneficial, for this study a ratio of 0.5 was used. As furfural oxidation with aqueous hydrogen peroxide can occur rapidly in the presence of a catalyst, a relatively short reaction time of 1 h was initially used to evaluate the rates of conversion by the catalysts at 50 °C (SI, Table S2). Using the Fe/HTS-1 catalyst, a higher furfural conversion was observed than for the unloaded HTS-1, likely due to Fenton processes. By contrast, using the other catalysts resulted in a lower conversion after 1 h. After 1 h of reaction, the intermediate 5HFO was formed in moderate yields and a small amount of MA was detected. Extending the reaction time to 8 h and subsequently 24 h for the most promising catalysts, allowed for evaluation of both the selectivity towards MA and of catalyst stability (Fig. 1). Here, the Fe/HTS-1 and Cu/HTS-1 catalysts showed a drastic decrease of MA yields compared to HTS-1, likely due to promotion of hydrogen peroxide decomposition [41]. Conversely, the Mn-, Zr- and Co-loaded HTS-1 catalysts displayed only a slight decrease in MA yields, while the Zn/HTS-1 catalyst gave similar results as pristine HTS-1. When using Ni/HTS-1, the highest MA yield of 32 % was obtained, which was a significant improvement of 28 % compared to the undoped HTS-1 catalyst (25 % yield). Increasing mesoporous pore volume did not significantly increase the MA yield compared to the untreated TS-1 (27 %). However, increased pore volume allows to introduce metal species into the pores. Overall, these experiments validated that metal impregnation had a noteworthy effect on the oxidation of furfural relative to undoped HTS-1 catalyst. As the structure and pore system of the metal oxide-loaded catalysts remained unchanged compared to HTS-1, the M/HTS-1 catalysts mainly appeared to differ in their acidic and basic properties. However, although furfural oxidation is an acid-catalyzed reaction, no clear relation between the acidity determined by NH3-TPD (SI, Table S3) and product yield could be observed. In situ formic acid generation contributing to acid catalysis [12,42], and the ability of some metal oxides to catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide [41,43], are thus also likely factors influencing the total product yield. 3.2 Optimization of reaction conditions towards maleic acid As the screening of M/HTS-1 catalysts showed nickel oxide to be a promising promotor for furfural oxidation, the catalytic performance of Ni/HTS-1 with respect to reaction time and hydrogen peroxide addition was therefore examined in more detail ( Fig. 2). The results revealed that Ni/HTS-1 had a lower initial furfural conversion rate (58 % conversion after 1 h) than HTS-1 (68 % conversion) (Table S2). However, after 6–24 h of reaction, use of the Ni/HTS-1 catalyst resulted in a higher MA yield than use of HTS-1, whereas the yield of the intermediate 5HFO was higher for HTS-1. This observation indicated that the reaction rates for the conversion of 5HFO were different for the catalysts. This distinct behaviour was also evident when tracking the molar ratio between MA and intermediate 5HFO over time (Figure S7). Nevertheless, after 48 h of reaction, the MA yield stagnated with Ni/HTS-1 compared to HTS-1, which may be a result of different rates of hydrogen peroxide conversion. The time study revealed that the ratio of hydrogen peroxide to furfural used in the reaction is an important factor for optimizing the MA yield. Variation of the H2O2/furfural ratio resulted in significant effects on MA yield for both catalysts (Fig. 2c-f). At low oxidant/substrate ratios of 2–4, the formation of MA was low as expected from the presence of only low oxidant amounts, near stochiometric levels of H2O2. However, the formation of 5HFO was increased when using Ni/HTS-1 compared to the use of HTS-1 catalyst (Fig. 2c,d). Increasing the H2O2/furfural ratio to 6 resulted in higher MA yields over Ni/HTS-1 within 8 h both compared to the use of HTS-1 and to the use of lower oxidant concentrations, indicating a better hydrogen peroxide utilization of Ni/HTS-1 compared to HTS-1 (Fig. 2c,d). A similar trend was observed when extending the reaction time to 24 h (Fig. 2e,f). At H2O2/furfural ratios of 10 or higher, similar MA yields were obtained when using Ni/HTS-1 and HTS-1. The formation of several byproducts as well as a lowered carbon balance at H2O2/furfural ratio of 20 indicated that the high amount of oxidant leads to overoxidation. Overall, the results suggest that modification of the catalyst HTS-1 catalyst with Ni led to improved MA yield at moderate H2O2/furfural ratios. The highest MA yield of 66 % for the Ni/HTS-1 catalyst was obtained after 24 h at 50 °C with H2O2/furfural ratio of 20. 3.3 Effects of Ni on catalyst acidity and leaching The promotional role of Ni in the Ni/HTS-1 catalyst was further investigated by additional characterization of the catalyst by TEM and TPD. The TEM images revealed a high dispersion of NiO nanosized particles (average size of 5.7 ± 1.3 nm) confined in the pores of HTS-1 ( Fig. 3). In addition, the TEM images show the presence of large rectangular pores with smaller entrance pores, an observation that is consistent with the N2 physisorption hysteresis showing an abrupt closure of the loop [44,45] (SI, Figure S2). NH3-TPD analysis of the catalyst corroborated an increased acidity and the presence of stronger acidic sites (observed by a shift in T max) in the modified catalyst compared to HTS-1 (SI, Figure S5 and Table S3). Even though no clear relation between acidity and catalytic activity was observed when comparing all catalysts, the change in the nature of the acidic sites could contribute to the increased MA yield obtained with Ni/HTS-1 by changing the adsorption modes and the pathway of the reaction. XPS was further used to evaluate the influence on the electronic effects of loading NiO into the catalyst. XPS of HTS-1 in the Ti 2p region showed two peaks corresponding to 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 separated by approximately 6 eV in binding energy (SI, Figure S6). The binding energy of 2p3/2 for HTS-1 and Ni/HTS-1 is 459.0 and 459.6 eV, respectively, which is attributed to tetrahedral Ti(IV) framework sites [46]. Octahedral extraframework Ti(IV) sites, which could be forming during the synthesis of HTS-1, were not present in amounts sufficient for meaningful deconvolution of peaks [36]. The tetrahedral Ti framework is generally assigned as active sites for catalysis although the geometry [47,48], role of Ti framework sites [49,50], and role of defects [51] are still debated. Conversely, the extraframework Ti sites are considered to reduce catalytic activity by blocking active sites and hydrogen peroxide decomposition [9]. The low amount of Ni (0.9 wt%) did not affect the binding energy of Ti by increasing electrophilicity of Ti, as has been observed for large Ni loading on (H)TS-1 catalysts in literature [18,26,27,52,53]. Overall, characterization of the Ni/HTS-1 catalyst suggested that the promotional effect of Ni loading likely derives from increased acidity, whereas any electronic effects of Ni doping Ti framework sites was not observed. Due to the acidic and oxidizing aqueous reaction mixture, leaching of metal species is an critical concern for furfural oxidation [7,9]. Metal leaching during the reaction was investigated by isolating catalysts after a representative reaction at 50 °C for 24 h with a H2O2/FF ratio of 15. XPS analysis of the Ti 2p area of the catalyst showed no significant change in binding energy for Ti species (SI, Figure S6). Relative ratios obtained from XPS analysis and EDXRF were used to estimate the relative amount of Ti and Ni on the surface and in the bulk of the catalyst, respectively (SI, Table S4). XPS analysis of the spent catalyst showed that only 85 % of Ti remained on the surface after catalysis, while only 30 % of Ni was accounted for. However, analysis of the bulk material by EDXRF showed that the Ti/Si ratio of the fresh catalyst (3.32) was almost unchanged after catalysis (3.45), indicating that Ti species did not leach but rather migrated from the catalyst surface. A similar trend was observed for the nickel species, where bulk analysis showed that 61 % of Ni remained in the spent catalyst. This observation indicated that the majority of nickel species migrated into the pore system of the catalyst during the reaction, but the remainder had likely leached into the reaction mixture. Reference experiments using nickel(II) acetate were conducted to evaluate whether dissolved Ni(II) species would influence catalytic activity even if all nickel had leached. The experiments showed that an equivalent amount of dissolved Ni(II) did not increase MA formation relative to a control in the absence of catalyst (Table S5) using identical reaction conditions. Thus, nickel species that could be leaching from the catalyst did not seem to contribute with catalytic activity. 3.4 In situ NMR spectroscopy tracks reaction species indicative of Baeyer-Villiger oxidation The intermediates formed during the HTS-1 and Ni/HTS-1 catalyzed furfural oxidation reactions were studied using in situ 13C NMR ( Fig. 4), and based on the results, a pathway for the furfural oxidation over the HTS-1 based catalysts is proposed in Scheme 2 (Figure S8 for assignment of chemical shifts). As time-resolved in situ 13C NMR spectroscopy does not allow for straightforward identification of species, assignments were aided by reference spectra of pure compounds as well as 1H-13C HSQC and HMBC spectra at the end of reaction (Figures S9 and S10). Overall, twelve species (1-12) could be identified and tracked in real time in the experiments of Fig. 4. The concentration of key species over time is tracked in Fig. 5. Notably, two species – furfural (1, FF) and its hydroperoxy adduct (2, FFP) - were generally observed in the NMR spectra immediately after the addition of hydrogen peroxide to the reaction mixtures. Despite the large excess of hydrogen peroxide, the signals of FF and FFP decayed in parallel and slowly over time, indicating that the formation of FFP was likely governed by a thermodynamic equilibrium between the free aldehyde and the hydroperoxy adduct [54]. Reference experiments in the absence of catalyst confirmed that the formation of FFP was noncatalytic, and although the reaction medium was water, hydrated aldehyde functionality of furfural was not detected in significant amounts, owing to the lower nucleophilicity of the oxygen in water relative to hydrogen peroxide due to the α-effect [34]. Notably, the conversion rate of furfural differed significantly in the in situ experiments for the two catalytic systems with full conversion of furfural reached after 15 and 21 h for Ni/HTS-1 and HTS-1, respectively. The conversion rates observed using in situ NMR were also significantly lower compared to reactions conducted in glass reactors with stirring, where ex situ NMR confirmed nearly full conversion of furfural after 2 h for both systems. The discrepancy in terms of conversion rates and product distribution between the in situ and ex situ NMR data can be largely attributed to the different reactors used and to the resultant pressure and mixing effects. In the time-resolved in situ NMR study with the Ni/HTS-1 catalyst (Fig. 4a), only furfural (1) and its hydroperoxy adduct (2) were observed initially, whereas formic acid was formed as one of the first products. In the literature, the proposed intermediates after formation of FFP are the carboxylic acid derivative (pathway I) or the formate derivative (pathway V) (see Scheme 1). Furoic acid (FA, 12) was formed as a minor byproduct of the reaction after approximately 10 h of reaction. However, due to the low intensity of the FA signals and the late formation of the intermediate compared to the formation of formic acid and other major products, it was evident that the carboxylic acid derivative route (pathway I) was not the major pathway for product formation. Likewise, the epoxidized furan product or the subsequent intermediates were not present, rendering pathway III as a route to product formation unlikely. Possibly, the conjugated aromatic system of the furfural hampers the furan epoxidation [54]. While neither the formate derivative of furfural (furan-2-yl formate) nor the short-lived 2-hydroxyfuran was observed, two other intermediates of pathway V, 2(3H)-furanone (3FO, 5) and 5-hydroxy-furan-2(5H)-one (5HFO, 3), were formed after few hours of reaction. 3FO and 5HFO were slowly consumed and converted into succinic acid (SA, 6) and malonic acid (MA, 4), respectively. 2(5H)-furanone (5FO, 7), a product of spontaneous tautermerization of 3FO was also present in small amounts (Fig. 5). 5FO is highly stable at similar reaction conditions and is therefore considered a product of furfural oxidation [34]. In a autocatalytic reaction at similar conditions, 5FO was detected in large amounts (SI, Table S5) suggesting that HTS-1 catalyzes the conversion of 2-hydroxyfuranone to 5HFO, thus preventing the formation of the thermodynamically favoured 5FO. Thus, the in situ experiment showed that the furfural oxidation over Ni/HTS-1 aligns with pathway V (see Schemes 1 and 2). This suggests that the product distribution is governed by the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation to 5HFO (3) in competition with the tauterimization of 2-hydroxyfuran to 3FO (5). In a system catalyzed using homogeneous acid, it has previously been shown that the formation of 5HFO increased at high acidic and oxidant concentrations, while the formation of 3FO was favoured at low pH [34]. Additionally, the minor products malic acid (MAc, 9) and malonic acid (MaloA, 11) were formed in detectable amounts after 12 and 20 h of reaction, respectively. Although the small amounts impede elucidation of formation pathways, traces of the two hydroxyperoxy adducts 8 and 10 were identified based on reported 13C chemical shifts [34]. Thus, based on previously proposed mechanisms [34], the formation of MAc and MaloA likely occur via oxidation of 3FO to form 8 which undergoes dehydration to form MAc or undergoes Baeyer-Villiger oxidation to form the malonic acid hydroxyperoxy adduct 10. The in situ NMR tracking of the HTS-1 catalyzed reaction (Fig. 4b) showed the same intermediates as those obtained in the Ni/HTS-1 catalyzed reactions, albeit with differences in the rate of their formation. Most notably, the key intermediates 3FO and 5HFO for SA and MA formation, respectively, were formed slower with HTS-1 than in the Ni/HTS-1 catalyzed reaction. Hence, even though the introduction of Ni to the catalyst does not alter the reaction pathway, it contributed to faster hydrogen peroxide consumption via formation of furfural hydroperoxyl adduct (FFP), which is likely facilitated by increased acidity. This interpretation was consistent with observations from catalytic performance tests, where the rate of the product formation with Ni/HTS-1 at moderate H2O2/furfural ratios was faster than with HTS-1 in the initial phase of the reaction. 4 Conclusions HTS-1 catalyst loaded with Ni (1 wt%) was found to exhibit higher catalytic activity than pristine HTS-1 for furfural oxidation with hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution. A combination of catalyst characterization and an in situ 13C NMR study tracking twelve chemicals confirmed that the loading of HTS-1 with Ni did not alter the reaction pathway, albeit the doping contributed to higher acidity and stronger acid sites which likely leads to better catalytic activity. The intermediates detected in the in situ NMR study of the HTS-1 catalysis substantiate the predominant usage of a pathway that is different from previously suggested pathways proceeding via epoxide formation, which is surprising, as TS-1 is well known for efficiently catalyzing epoxidations [17,55]. Instead, the oxidation of furfural was found to proceed via a furfural peroxide adduct and subsequent lactone formation, similar to the pathway suggested to be catalyzed by sulphonic acid resins and Lewis acids. In the future, the new understanding of the TS-1 catalyzed furfural oxidation may contribute to more informed decisions in catalyst design and optimization.

        "dc:description": "Oxidation of biomass-derived furfural with hydrogen peroxide provides a sustainable path to 1,4-diacids for polymer production. The state-of-the-art catalyst, titanium silicate (TS-1), suffers from drawbacks including deactivation and diffusion limitations, but its catalytic activity can be improved by introducing mesoporosity and metal species. Herein, hierarchical TS-1 (HTS-1) catalysts loaded with different metal oxides were prepared and examined for furfural oxidation with aqueous hydrogen peroxide. HTS-1 loaded with Ni (Ni/HTS-1) yielded 32 % maleic acid from furfural under screening conditions, which was 28 % higher relative yield than unloaded HTS-1 under the same conditions. Catalyst characterization and an in situ 13C NMR study elucidated the promotional role of Ni and the pathway, by which the reaction proceeds. Surprisingly, the NMR study indicated that the reactions using both Ni/HTS-1 and unloaded HTS-1 proceed via formation of furfural peroxide followed by Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, and not via epoxidation as many other TS-1 catalyzed oxidations.",
