Graphical abstract Mesoporous silica fiber was treated with ZrCl4 and subsequently with LiCp or LiInd to produce a heterogeneous catalyst designed for olefin polymerization. Emphasis of the study was put on the characterization of the resulting ZrCl x L/SiO2 structure with elemental analysis, FTIR and solid state 1H and 13C NMR, but the activity in the polymerization of ethylene was also tested. Heterogeneous zirconocene catalysts were prepared with an unconventional method by grafting mesoporous silica SBA-15 fiber with ZrCl4 in gas or liquid phase and subsequently with lithium salt of cyclopentadiene (Cp) or indene (Ind). In order to obtain a better understanding of the bonding modes of the zirconium and the ligands, the ZrCl x /SiO2 and ZrCl x L/SiO2 were now for the first time characterized by several techniques, including elemental analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, 1H MAS NMR and 13C CP MAS NMR. The results verify the η5-bonding of the ligands to the metal center, which in turn was discovered to be both mono- and bifunctionally bonded to the silica. The catalysts were tested in ethylene polymerization, in which they yielded polyethylene with moderate activities. Keywords Mesoporous silica SBA-15 Metallocene NMR Polymerization Zirconium 1 Introduction In olefin polymerization, among the best catalysts for the tailoring of the properties of polyolefins are metallocenes. Although metallocene complexes can be used in a homogeneous form, they are often used in the heterogeneous one, i.e. they are supported on an insoluble carrier prior to the polymerization. Typical support materials are silica and alumina, but also magnesium chloride, zeolites, clays, micelles, libid bilayers, liquid or organic crystals and polymers have been used as catalyst carriers [1,2]. The reasons for the heterogenization of the metallocene are, for example, slower deactivation of the metallocene, avoidance of reactor fouling, less cocatalyst required, good and uniform polymer morphology, high polymer density and requirements of the commercial polymerization processes [3]. Methods for heterogenization of the metallocene complex to the support are often divided in three groups: (1) direct immobilization of the metallocene on the support, (2) immobilization on support pretreated with methylaluminoxane (MAO) [4,5] or alkylaluminium [6,7] and (3) activation of metallocene with aluminoxane prior to the immobilization [1,8]. In addition to these three methods, there is also a fourth way to obtain supported metallocene catalyst, namely direct step-by-step preparation of the metallocene on the support surface. This can be done by linking cyclic ligands through a functional group in the ligand or ansa-ligand to the surface and subsequently attaching a metal center to the ligands [9–11]. Or vice versa, as have been done, for example, by Spitz et al. [12,13]. They grafted ZrCl4 onto the silica surface, and then inserted cyclopentadienyl or indenyl ligands to the zirconium, thus producing a heterogeneous zirconocene catalyst. The advantages of this stepwise catalyst preparation method are its simplicity and the possibility to combine a variety of metals and ligands. In this study we have used a method similar to that of Spitz et al. [12,13] to prepare stepwise cyclopentadienyl and indenyl zirconocene catalysts on a silica surface. However, mesoporous silica fiber was used as the support material due to its high surface area and claimed capability for extrusion polymerization [14]. Differing from the previous studies, the stepwise prepared zirconocene catalysts were characterized by several techniques, including 1H and 13C CP MAS NMR, before the catalysts are being tested in the polymerization of ethylene. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Mesoporous silica support, fiber-like SBA-15, was prepared according to the procedure of Zhao et al. [15]. For the removal of the organic template the as-synthesized SBA-15 was calcined at 560°C in air for 9h. Nitrogen flow was used during the heating step. Zirconium(IV) chloride (99.95+%) and lithium cyclopentadienide (LiCp, 97%) were purchased from ABCR Chemicals and used as received. Poly(ethylene glycol) (EO)-poly(propylene glycol) (PO) triblock copolymer (EO20PO70EO20, M n ca. 5800), 1.6M butyllithium in hexane and cyclopentadienyl and indenylzirconium(IV) trichlorides (CpZrCl3 and IndZrCl3, both 97%) were purchased from Aldrich. Toluene, pentane, heptane, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and diethylether (all from Riedel-de Haën) and cyclopentane (Fluka) were dried according to the usual procedures. Methylaluminoxane (10% in toluene, Albemarle) was used without further purification. Lithium indenide (LiInd) was prepared [16] by adding equal amount of butyllithium (1.6M in hexane, Aldrich) to indene (99+%, Aldrich) under argon atmosphere. Both reagents were first diluted in diethylether and cooled to −70°C. The mixture was mixed for 22h and allowed slowly to warm up to room temperature. Solvent was evaporated in vacuum, dry cyclopentane added and the solution cooled to −70°C, which led to the precipitation of the lithium indenide. Slightly pink product was recovered by decantation and drying in a vacuum. 13C CP MAS NMR signals of the solid lithium indenide were observed at 122.2, 112.3 and 93.1ppm. 2.2 Catalyst preparation Silica support (1.5g) was mixed with ZrCl4 (0.38g for silica A and 0.75g for silica B) and placed in a quartz tube. Vacuum was introduced to the tube, the valves were closed and the tube was placed in an oven at 300°C. After 30min, a dynamic vacuum was introduced for 30min to remove the unreacted ZrCl4. The tube was filled with nitrogen and transferred into a nitrogen glove box. The product was washed with 4× 20ml of boiling toluene or THF to further remove unreacted ZrCl4, then dried in vacuum at 150°C. The lithium salt of the desired ligand (LiCp or LiInd) was dissolved in a small amount of THF (2–3ml) and pipetted on 1.2g of the zirconium-modified silica support (V pore =0.5–1.0cm3/g). After 2h of diffusion of the solution into the pores, 20ml of toluene was added and the suspension shaked at 50–80°C under argon overnight. The product was then filtered and washed with 4× 20ml of toluene, dried in vacuum and washed with 2× 15ml of pentane to remove the toluene residues. Then it was dried again at 50°C in vacuum. The final products are here called catalysts, even though without activation they are actually catalyst precursors. 2.3 Ethylene polymerization The polymerizations were made with a 500ml Büchi stainless steel reactor with the following way: the catalyst in 10ml of heptane and the cocatalyst MAO (Al/Zr=1000) were packed in separate stainless steel catalyst containers in a nitrogen glove box. Heptane (250ml) was transferred under an inert atmosphere into the evacuated reactor and heated to the desired polymerization temperature (80°C). Both the catalyst and cocatalyst were transferred into the reactor using a nitrogen overpressure. Under 400rpm stirring, the catalyst was allowed to activate for 5min before 5bars of ethylene was introduced to the reactor, simultaneously raising the stirring rate to 600rpm. During the polymerization the temperature was kept constant as well as the partial pressure after it had reached the set value. The calculations of polymerization activity were based on the average ethylene pressure (3.63–4.76bar), measured by the computer coupled with the reactor. The reaction was terminated by venting ethylene, opening the reactor and then by adding ethanol. The polymer was stirred in acidic (HCl) ethanol solution for 3–4h, filtered, washed with ethanol and dried at room temperature. 2.4 Characterizations BET surface area, pore size, pore size distribution and pore volume of the silica were determined by nitrogen physisorption using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010. The samples were degassed at 155°C for at least 3h, preferably overnight. A Nicolet Impact 400D FTIR spectrometer, connected to a nitrogen glove box and equipped with a DRIFT unit, was used to evaluate the presence of hydroxyl groups on the silicas and catalysts. Measurements were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere, the sample being undiluted and measured on a mirror plate. A Chemagnetics CMX 400MHz Infinity, Chemagnetics CMX 270MHz Infinity and Bruker Avance 400MHz spectrometers were used in the characterization of the silica and the catalyst and in the quantitative determination of the hydroxyl groups and cyclic ligands. Zirconia rotor systems with diameters of 6 or 7mm were used in the measurements. Zirconium contents of the catalysts were determined with a TJA IRIS ICP-AES (Offenbach, Germany) and chloride by a potentiometric titration with AgNO3. SEM images of the silica support were obtained with a Hitachi S4800 scanning electron microscope. The zirconium distribution in the silica was determined with a SEM-EDS (JEOL 840 with a PGS EDS analysator at Fortum Oil & Gas Oy, samples casted in Epofix resin, microtomed and sputtered with carbon). Molecular weights were determined by the measurement of dilute solution viscosity (decalin, 135°C) with a capillary viscometer as described in ASTM D 1601 [17]. Antioxidant BHT (0.2wt.%) was added in the decalin in order to avoid oxidation of the polymer. The solution concentration was 15–98mgdl−1 and the polymer samples were dissolved at 165–185°C under nitrogen atmosphere. The nominal molecular weights were calculated using Mark-Houwink constants K =62×10−3 mlg−1 and α =0.700 [18]. Melting points were determined with a Mettler-Toledo DSC821e (Zürich, Switzerland) differential scanning calorimeter using a scanning rate of 10K/min. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Preparation and characterization of zirconium-modified silica Inspection of the SBA-15 type silica support with a SEM revealed a rope-like structure (Fig. 1 ). The average length of the ropes was 10–150μm and thickness 2–20μm. The ropes consisted of intertwined, parallel aligned bundle of wires (thickness 300–400nm), in which the tubular mesopores are hexagonally ordered and oriented parallel to the fiber axis. BET surface area of 930m2/g, average pore diameter of 57Å and pore volume of 1.18cm3/g were determined by nitrogen physisorption. According to 1H MAS NMR measurements, the hydroxyl group surface densities were 1.5 and 0.34OH/nm2 for isolated and hydrogen bonded SiOH, respectively (silica A). Two synthesis batches of silica (Table 2) were used for different catalyst compositions, but due to identical synthesis conditions there were no remarkable differences in the surface properties. Zirconium(IV) chloride was grafted on the silica surface in gas phase at 300°C, the reaction going as follows: (1) nSi–OH+ZrCl4 →(Si–O) n ZrCl4−n + nHCl; n =1,2 The formation of ZrO2 during the grafting cannot be disclosed, as the 300°C has been found to be an adequate temperature for the formation of some ZrO2 from ZrCl4 on silica [19]. Washing of the as-synthesized, white product with toluene turned it yellow and washing with THF light brown. Some physisorbed ZrCl4 may have remained on the silica at this stage, but later when the insertion of cyclic ligands turns the zirconium complex into a more soluble form, the physisorbed ZrCl4 is removed. The final precatalyst was considered to be free of non-bonded zirconocene. SEM-EDS was useful in confirming the dispersion of zirconium chloride in the silica fiber (Fig. 2 ). An elemental analysis from the cross-section of a silica fiber showed an even distribution of Zr, which proved the ZrCl4 had reached also the inner pore surface of the support, not just the outer fiber surface. Since the microtomed samples were exposed to air, chlorine may have escaped as HCl and did not show up clearly in all the images. The results from zirconium and chloride content analysis are presented in Table 1 . The Cl/Zr molar ratios 2.5 and 2.6 of the supports indicate the zirconium is both mono- and bifunctionally bonded to the surface. However, in interpretation of the bonding mode of zirconium based merely on Cl/Zr ratio, also the possible formation of ZrO2 and Si–Cl bonds [20] has to be considered. Nitrogen physisorption was used to determine the changes in the BET surface area, average pore diameter and pore volume of the silica caused by the grafting with ZrCl4 (Table 2 ). The results clearly show that surface area and pore volume decreased, and average pore diameter increased, as expected. Normally one would expect a decrease in the pore diameter due to the incorporation of ZrCl4, but in the case of SBA-15 it is not so. The tubular mesopores of the SBA-15, namely, are interconnected with micropores [21], which are clogged in the grafting with the ZrCl4. As the pore diameter presented in Table 2 is calculated as an average value, disappearance of the micropores (observed in the pore size distribution graph) leads to a higher d pore value. The change is especially clear for support BZ, which has almost twice the zirconium concentration of AZ. Fig. 3b shows an FTIR spectrum of mesoporous silica after incorporation of zirconium into the pore surfaces. Comparison to the spectrum of pure silica, Fig. 3a, reveals consumption of OH-groups (sharp signal at 3742cm−1 for isolated OH and broad signal at ∼3600cm−1 for hydrogen bonded OH) during ZrCl4 treatment, as expected. The formation of Si–O–Zr linkages should be observed at 950cm−1 [22], but it is unfortunately in the same area where also the Si–O–Si band exists. The vibrations at 2960–2850cm−1 in spectrum 3a are probably due to C–H stretching of residual organic fragments of the triblock copolymer template, which have been trapped inside the silica structure and thus have not been fully removed despite calcination [23]. As can be observed in spectrum 3b and Table 4, the consumption of the isolated hydroxyl groups is not complete even though enough ZrCl4 is used to obtain a zirconium loading of 12–13wt.% in the silica. The OH concentration of silica A before the ZrCl4 reaction was 0.34 H-bonded and 1.5 isolated OH/nm2, which, in theory, would allow 0.66g of ZrCl4 to react with 1g of the silica. The calculation is based on the assumption that there are no inaccessible OH groups and that ZrCl4 reacts monofunctionally with all of the hydroxyl groups. In that case, the theoretical saturation limit of zirconium is 16.6wt.% for this particular silica. The presence of inaccessible OH groups, however, cannot be disclosed. The zirconium-modified silica was characterized also by 29Si NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 4 ). Measurements with both the CP MAS and ordinary decoupled pulse program confirmed the reaction of surface hydroxyls as reduction of the Q3 silicon atoms, indicating the formation of Zr–O–Si linkages. No change was observed in the inner Q4 atoms, which suggests that the zirconium has not drifted deeper into the silica structure, i.e. it is present only on the pore surface. 3.2 Insertion of ligands Next step in catalyst preparation was to insert the cyclic ligands, cyclopentadienyl and indenyl, to the zirconium-modified silica surface. The amounts of ligand (LiCp and LiInd) salts were set to correspond to 500–600 and 800–1300μmol/g of silica for Cp and Ind, respectively. After washing and drying, the zirconium, chloride and ligand contents of the catalyst were analyzed again (Table 3 ). The Cl/Zr ratio of the support does not change much, mainly due to the high excess of Zr and Cl on the support compared to the cyclic ligands. Four different Cp catalysts were prepared. Three of them were prepared as previously described but one was prepared grafting ZrCl4 in toluene suspension instead of gas phase (AZ-Cp2). The best method to evaluate the amount of cyclic ligands bonded to the silica surface turned out to be 1H solid state NMR spectroscopy. Conventional carbon analysis could not be used due to presence of some coordinated THF, which could not be removed without a possible decomposition of the catalyst. The zirconium and Cp ligand concentrations are listed in Table 4 . An interesting finding is that in the five Cp-catalysts prepared, the Zr/Cp molar ratio is the same (3.0), irrespective of the zirconium concentration on the support and of the amount of Cp used in the reaction. In AZ-Cp2 the amount of Cp used in the catalyst preparation was 600μmol/g, in the other catalysts it was 500μmol/g. Apparently a Cp ligand occupies a space of three zirconium chloride groups on the surface. In this case most of the zirconium species seems to be closely packed, in other words existing as islands. If the zirconium species were scattered on the surface with long intermolecular distances, the Zr/Cp ratio would probably be smaller. The saturation density of cyclopentadienyl on the zirconium-modified silica surface (Cp/nm2) thus depends on the zirconium concentration, which in turn, naturally depends on the density of hydroxyl groups on the surface. Fig. 3c shows an FTIR spectrum of catalyst AZ-Cp3. Compared to the zirconium-modified silica, a broad signal at 3700–3200cm−1 has appeared. It is possible this signal originates from the remaining hydroxyl groups of the silica perturbed by hydrogen bonding interactions with oxygen atoms of coordinated THF [24]. In addition, the partially positive hydrogen atoms of the hydroxyl groups may also interact with the negative chlorides of lithium chloride, which is formed in the reaction of surface Zr–Cl and lithium salt of the ligand. LiCl is non-soluble in toluene and THF and thus remains in the pores of the silica. Since the concentration of Cp ligand on the support is very low, the Cp vibrations in IR will also be very weak. In addition, most of the signals of Zr–Cp lie at the same wave numbers as those of silica, so they are mostly obscured. An IR vibration of η5-bonded Cp ligand is typically observed at 3946cm−1 [24], where indeed a very weak signal exists (Fig. 3c). Other signals of Cp ring due to the C–H stretching and symmetric distortion of C–C bonds are typically observed at 3100 and 1443cm−1, respectively [22,25]. In spectrum 3c, these two signals are observed as weak vibrations at 3118 and 1445cm−1. Solid state 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy was used to evaluate the structure and bonding of the Cp and Ind ligands on the zirconium-modified silica surface. Examples of the NMR spectra are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 . The signals of the coordinated THF are visible especially in the 13C NMR spectra at 75 and 25ppm. Resonances of free THF are observed at 68 and 26ppm (not much present in our catalysts). In 1H MAS NMR the resonances of Cp-rings are rather broad, which implies they are rather restricted in motion. In addition, the 13C CP MAS NMR spectra show spinning sidebands from the Cp ring, which rules out isotropic motion of the ring (Fig. 6). The chemical shift at 114.8ppm is characteristic for zirconium bonded Cp ligand [22] and differs from that of LiCp (106.0ppm). According to these results, one could draw a conclusion the rings are bound to the surface and there on zirconium. In some samples, e.g. AZ-Cp1 (Fig. 5a), the 1H NMR signal due to hydrogen atoms in the Cp ring seemed to consist of at least two signals. The most probable explanation for the two Cp signals is the presence of the Cp ligands in two different chemical environments, i.e. either in mono- or bifunctionally bonded zirconium. On the other hand, one could also suggest that a possible explanation for the two signals is a η1-bonding due to the reaction of a single carbon in the Cp ring instead of a η5-bonding of the whole ring system. Only one η1-bonded Cp ligand, however, makes the zirconium atom electron-deficient. Unless more than one Cp ligand has been bonded to the same metal center and one of them is η5-bonded, monohapto bonding is improbable. In addition, it has been shown that the η1-bonded Cp ligand can be down to −87°C fluxional enough to show only one 1H and 13C NMR signal [26,27], which is at the same ppm value as the signal of η5-bonded Cp ligand. Thus, in measurements made at room temperature, it is very unlikely to see more than one peak in the 1H NMR spectra even if the Cp ligands were η1-bonded. The 13C MAS NMR spectra of the indenyl catalyst showed weak signals for the cyclic ligands when compared to those of the Cp catalysts. Lithium indenide is only poorly soluble in THF (or any other organic solvent we tested), so possibly the ligand salts have not properly reached the Zr–Cl groups in the pores of the support. The strongest 13C MAS NMR signal in the spectrum of the indenyl catalysts was observed at 125ppm, but weak resonances were detected also at 144–140, 132 and 39ppm (Fig. 7 ). These weak signals are at different ppm values than those typically reported for indenyl ligands η5-bonded to zirconium (135–100ppm) [28–30]. Since indene has signals at 145, 144, 134, 132, 126–121 and 39ppm in the 13C spectrum, it is reasonable to suggest that part of the lithium indenide is somehow converted to indene. The weak signals in the spectrum are also narrow, which suggests that they originate from a mobile molecule. One could suggest that the lithium indenide may have reacted with the residual silanols of the surface, that has yielded indene. In that case the same reaction could take place also with LiCp, yielding dicyclopentadiene. Dicyclopentadiene, however, could not be observed in the 13C CP MAS NMR spectra, perhaps due to its possible volatility (b.p. 170°C). Nevertheless, the strong signal at 125.5ppm in Fig. 7 verifies that most of the indenyl ligands have been bonded to the zirconium. 3.3 Ethylene polymerization In order to find out the catalytic activity of the prepared catalysts they were activated with MAO (Al/ligand=1000) and used in the polymerization of ethylene. Table 5 summarizes the polymerization results. Polymerization activity is the most useful result when one wishes to evaluate the number on active centers on the catalyst surface, but polydispersity M w/M n, on the other hand, gives idea of the number of different kinds of active centers on the catalyst. Unfortunately, due to low polymerization yields, the amounts of catalyst residues in some of the polymerization products were high, which led to the clogging of the filters of the gel permeation chromatograph (GPC). In addition, the samples with the highest molar masses did not dissolve properly in trichlorobenzene which also prevented the use of GPC. Thus the average molar masses of the samples were determined with a capillary viscometer, and therefore no M w/M n results are available. The zirconium-modified silica without any cyclic ligands (ZrSBA) polymerizes ethylene with low activity in the presence of MAO (Table 5), as reported also by Spitz et al. [12]. The molar mass of the polyethylene prepared with ZrSBA as the catalyst is 3.76 million, already in the range of UHMWPE. Since Kageyama et al. [14] discovered the capability of Cp2Ti-MSF (mesoporous silica fiber) to produce UHMWPE (M v =6.2 million), it is unclear whether this 3.76 million is a partial result of the mesoporous support or a sole product of the zirconium chloride on the silica surface. As can be observed from Table 5, the incorporation of cyclic ligands to the ZrSBA increases the polymerization activity of zirconium chloride. This effect can be considered as further evidence, that the ligands are bonded to zirconium. The polymerization activities of the prepared actual catalysts are far from those obtained from homogeneous polymerizations with Cp2ZrCl2. This is a common phenomenon with supported metallocenes and results, for example, from steric hindrance and increased bond energies in the transition state of the active site [31]. Of our catalysts the most active is AZ-Cp2, which was prepared by immobilizing the zirconium chloride on an SBA-15 type silica with the adsorption in toluene, and the Cp rings were attached with the incipient wetness method using THF as the solvent. The polymerization activities of stepwise prepared catalyst are about the same (Cp) or higher (Ind) than those obtained by commercial zirconocene trichloride complexes adsorbed on silica. Leaching is also a common problem with supported metallocenes whenever alkylaluminums or methylaluminumoxane (which always contain free trimethylaluminum) are used. The reaction of alkylaluminums result in the cleavage of the Si–O bond, which leads to the desorption of the active metallocene from the support [32]. This, in turn, leads to a partial polymerization in homogeneous media and thus to a more heterogeneous product, not to mention the reactor fouling. Unfortunately in many research articles describing a MAO-cocatalyzed polymerization with heterogenized metallocene catalyst, the leaching study has been omitted and therefore it is not known whether the metallocene actually remains on the support during the polymerization. In this study, to observe whether part of the active catalyst component is desorbed during the polymerization, the catalyst, MAO and heptane were stirred in a 500ml glass reactor at 80°C under nitrogen for the same time as the polymerization would take place. The mixture was then filtered in a nitrogen glove box and transferred into a 250ml Büchi stainless steel polymerization reactor for ethylene polymerization. No additional MAO was used in the polymerization. This leaching experiment with the cyclopentadienyl catalyst revealed that part of the catalyst desorbed from the support during the polymerization. The polymerization activity of the leaching experiment (88kgPE/(molhbar)) is, however, only about 10% of the corresponding normal polymerization with the heterogeneous catalyst (920kgPE/(molhbar)). The amount is relatively low, keeping in mind that the leached metallocene is in homogeneous media, thus producing ethylene with far higher activity than the parent heterogeneous catalyst. Of course, part of the leached species may have been deactivated during the handling and filtering, so this method of studying the leaching cannot be used as an exact measure of the desorbed metallocene. Another method [33] of studying the leaching would be the determination of metal content on the catalyst prior to and after the reaction with MAO, but the adsorption of the MAO on the silica makes that method unreliable too. 4 Conclusions In this study we stepwise prepared heterogeneous zirconocene catalysts by bonding the metal center first onto mesoporous silica fiber, followed by insertion of cyclic ligands to the metal. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first time the catalysts prepared with this method were characterized by several techniques. Insertion of cyclopentadienyl ligands on zirconium-modified mesoporous silica succeeded well, indenyl ligands in lesser extent. The use of other synthesis procedures or wider pore silica might enhance bonding of indenyl ligand too. According to IR and NMR measurements both ligand types were bonded to the zirconium, and the results specifically point to the η5-bonding. Coordinated THF is also present on the zirconium-modified silica surface, but according to NMR spectra there is no evidence THF is still present in those metal centers where a cyclic ligand has bonded. When activated with MAO, the ZrCl4-modified silica produces ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene, yet with very low polymerization activity. Insertion of Cp or Ind ligands significantly increases the activity, which is further evidence the ligands are bonded to the zirconium. Polymerization activities of the prepared catalyst are also slightly improved compared to the commercial zirconocene trichlorides grafted directly onto silica. Molar masses and melting points of the polymers produced with stepwise prepared Cp and Ind catalysts were similar to those of polyethylenes obtained with impregnated CpZrCl3 and IndZrCl3. On the whole, the main advantage of this stepwise catalyst preparation is the ability to prepare various metal–ligand combinations on the silica surface, especially such that could not be obtained by impregnating a commercial metallocene complex on a support. Furthermore, this catalyst preparation method is a good way to examine the effect of different ligand–metal combinations on the polymerization activity and on the structure and properties of the polymer formed.
