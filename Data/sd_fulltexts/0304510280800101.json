T oyortaka, Osaka 560 (Japan) (Rec-ivied December 10, 1979) The water gas shift reaction (WGSR) has great industrial importance in the use of coal as a clean energy source and in the adjustment of the H2:C0 ratio in synthesis gas used for methanation and the Fisher-Tropsch synthesis: H20 + CO H2 + C02 Lower temperature operation for this reaction is favorable from the standpoint of thermodynamic equilibrium. Thus, in recent years, many homogeneous transition metal catalysts active at lower temperature have been developed [ 1 - 9] . The transition metal complexes alone show loco catalytic activity and some additives such as KOH, amines, and tin chloride appear to be essential for attaining high activity. However, their function in catalysis, especially in the case of amines, is obscure. While studying the function of the amines for the WGSR, we found that rhodium carbonyl cluster-ethylenediamine catalyst systems showed higher activity under mild reaction conditions than tile reported catalysts. Tile substitution of diamines for KOH as a base, and for alcohol as a solvent O simplify the reaction system. The following experiment provides a general procedure for the WGSR. The reaction vessel was a 25 ml flak with a sidearm sealed with silicone rubber. It was attached to a closed reaction system with a reflug condenser, a gas circulator, and a vent. The rhodium compound was placed in the vessel. The reaction system was evacuated and flushed three times with CO and then charged at room temperature to an initial CO pressure of 700 mm Hg. Amine and H20 were added O the vessel. The solution was heated with stirring to 100 C. The gas above the dark brown solution waas sampled periodically and analyzed by gas chromatography (3.0 m column of activated carbon)- 228 Representative examples using Rh6(CO)16 are showed in Table 1. Diamines are effective amines for the WGSR*. Monoamines, e.g. (Et)3N, (n-Pr)2NH, and piperidine which are often used as the base in other studies formed no or little hydrogen under our reaction conditions. Characteristic features of the diamines are as follows: (1) increasing the volume of the amine increases the yield of hydrogen (runs 1,2) and in the absence of the amine, only a trace of hydrogen is produced; (2) increasing the number of methylene groups in NH2(CH2)n NH2 compounds (rc = 2, 3, 4, 6) decreases the yield (runs 2 - 5) and the turnover number with hesamethylen famine falls to 8.6; (3) among ethylenediamine derivatives, met.5yl substituents on nitrogen depress the catalytic activity, while the methyl substituent on meths 12ne carbon increases it (runs 6 - 9); (4) no catalysis occurs when using 2,2'-bipyridine although pyridine gives a moderate activity (runs 10, 11)- To our knowledge, ethylenediamine and 1,2-diaminopropane are the best additive amines for the WGSR. In comparison with t-he activity of previously reported rhodium catalysts, the Rli6(CO)16-diarnine catalyst systems have much higher activity than [Rh(CO)2C1] 2-HCL-Nal-AcOH (turnover number 9.0/day at 90 C, 250 400 mmHg of CO) [21 and Rhs(CO)16-KOH-C2HSOC2H40H (3.4/day at 100 'C, 684 mmHg of CO) [7] catalyst systems. Furthermore, the rate of hydrogen formation using ethylenediamine (run 1) is superior to that when using H.,Ru4 (CO)12-Fe(CO)5-pipeadine-ethoxyethanol and Ru3(CO)r2H2S04-diglyme [ 71 . In order to determine the species present under catalytically active conditions, the catalysis was quenched by the addition of excess N(CH3)3BzCl which yielded a black precipitate with vco at 1957 and 1797 cm-'. However, the solid residue isolated after low temperature evaporation of the amine displayed the same carbonyl stretching bands. The structures of these species are under investigation. Using ethylenediamine, several rhodium compounds were tried as the catalyst. RhC13-3H20 produced no hydrogen but Rh2(CO402, RL,4(CO)r2, and Rh12(CO)302- showed catalytic activities comparable with RhG(CO)js,. At this stage, comment regarding the significant yield acceleration with the diamines would be largely speculative- Since the steric bulk of a methyl substituent en nitrogen in the diamines depresses the activity and the yield of hydrogen can not be related to the amine basicities, the coordination of the amine to rhodium may play an important role in the yield acceleration. This speculation can be also supported by pyridine experiments: 7-picoline (p& = 6.12) gave a tumover number of 50 while a-picoline (pK, = 5.97) gave a turnover number of 1.0. *Under the reaction conditions, it seems that the C02 formed may be perfectly convert to carbamates because the addition of HCl after 4 h reaction yielded C02 nearly equivalent to _32. 229 TABLE 1 Water gas shift reaction using PJxdCO)jG-awe homogeneous catalysts: Run CZHSOC2H4OH Amine (pK~jb Yield of Activity d (ml ) hydrogen (mmol) 1` 0 NH2Cq2CH2NH2(9.971 4.9 98 2 4-4 NH2CH2CH2NH2(9.97) 3.7 75 3 3.0 NH2(CH2)3DM2(10.65) 1.6 32 4 1.6 NH2(CH2)4NHz(1Q.84) 0.3 6.4 5 0 NH2(CH2)sNH2(11.0)E 0.4 8.6 6 2.8 NH2CH2CHNH2 4.3 86 IH3 7 0 NHCH2CH2NH(10_16) 3.5 69 CH3 CH3 8 0 NH2CH2CH2N(CH3)2(9_53) 2.3 46 9 0 N(CH3)2CH2CH2N(CH3)2 0.1 2_5 (8.97) i0 0 ac-) (4_14) 0 0 11 3.3 Q- (5.17) 1_1 22 H 12 1.7 (11.2) 0.08 1.6 13 0 (n-C3H7)2NH(11.0) trace 0 14E 0 (C2H5)3N(10_9) trace 0 15r-h 0 (C2H5)aN(10.9) trace O aExcept where noted, 0.05 mmol of Rb6(CO)16, 85 mmol of amine, 40 mmol of H20, 110-urine] ml of ethosyerlaanol, and 700 mmHg of initial CO pressure were used; the reaction temperature was 100 C; the total volume of the reaction system was 230 ml- bCited from reference 10. `The values were reproducible to about = 7 %o. d'hu.-uover number = mote of hydrogen/mole of rhodium complex per 4 h. 10 ml of ethylenedia mine 150 mol) was used- f Cited from reference 11. c10 m! of (C2H5)3N (72 mmol) was used.
