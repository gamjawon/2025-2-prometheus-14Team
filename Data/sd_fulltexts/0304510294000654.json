Introduction Isobutane alkylation is one of the most important processes for producing reformulated gasoline Commercial alkylation plants use either sulfuric acid or hydrogen fluoride as catalysts The advantages and disadvantages of the two processes have often been debated alkylate quality, cooling and separation problems, operating costs, safety aspects [ 1 ] Aluminium chloride based catalysts have been described for a long time as much more active catalysts than conventional ones. However, due to the high acidity of aluminium chloride, side reactions such as cracking, disproportionation and isomenzation are important To reduce the acidity of aluminium chloride some \"bases\" such as alkali metal chloride, methanol, ether, aromatic hydrocarbons and/or certain metal chlorides have been added [2-4] We have anticipated that another way to control the acidity of alummium chloride consists in adding tetrasubstituted ammonium chlorides Mixtures of aluminium 0304-5102/94/$07 00 1994 Elsevier Science B V All rights reserved SSDI0304-5102(94)00065-4 156 Yves Chauvin et al /Journal of Molecular Catalyses 92 (1994) 155-165 chloride and alkylpyndinium chlorides or dialkylimidazolium chlorides are liquid at room temperature and below, over a wide range of compositions These melts have received considerable attention in many electrochemical applications such as electrolytes in batteries or aluminium electroplating baths [ 5 ] One very attractive feature of these systems is that their Lewis acidity can easily be adjusted by varying the aluminium molar fraction present in the system For example, they can be considered as basic when the alummium chloride molar fraction contained in the melt (denoted N) is lower than 0 5, and acidic for N > 0 5 It has been demonstrated that anionic species present in the acidic organohaloaluminate molten salts are AICl4 , A12CI7 and A13CI10 Lewis acidity originates from dissociation of AIC13 from di- and trimenc anions Quantitative determination of the acidic properties of these media has been done by IR and UV spectral shifts of organoiron complexes containing CO and -CN ligands [6], by 3'P NMR chemical shift of tnethylphosphine oxide [ 7 ] and lastly by 'H NMR chemical shift of the cyclopentadienyl protons in Cp2MC12 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) [ 8 ] In a previous paper we described the use of molten salts based on butylmethylimidazolium chloride and aluminium chloride for isobutane alkylation with ethylene [ 9 ] The present paper reports the results we obtained in the alkylation of isobutane with 2-butene catalyzed by the same molten salts 2. Experimental Haloaluminate molten salts were prepared as previously described [ 5 ] All the alkylation experiments were carried out in a 250 ml-capacity FischerPorter flask immersed in a cooling bath ( t 0 5 C) In all experiments the rate of agitation was constant and ensured by a magnetic stirring bar A stainless steel cylindrical grid (25 mesh) was fixed inside the flask to improve the dispersion of the ionic phase into the hydrocarbon phase A sufficient amount (e g , 70 g) of abutane-butane mixture (containing a small amount of water, approx 60 ppm) was charged, before starting, into the reactor containing the molten salt (7 ml) in order to insure good mixing at the reaction start-up Thus the volumetric ratio of acid to hydrocarbon phases was much lower than that generally used in sulfuric acid catalyzed alkylation The feedstock, a mixture of a-butane, butane (internal standard not modified during the reaction) and 2-butene (mixture of cis and trans isomers) was contained in a 100 ml Fischer-Porter flask and stored over 3 A molecular sieves The isobutane to 2-butene ratio in the feed was 1 5 The feed was continuously fed through a microvalve into the reactor The addition rate was defined as the volume of pure liquid 2-butene per volume of molten salt contained in the reactor per hour (LHSV) During an experiment, from time to time, stirring was stopped, the molten salt was decanted and aliquots of the hydrocarbon phase were withdrawn for analysis In this way, it was possible to obtain various isobutane conversions When the reactor was full (150 g), all the hydrocarbon upper phase Yves Chauvin et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 92 (1994) 155-165 Molecular Sievle r u Microvalve Coolinq bath Reactor _- Gzid I-- Alkylate I-_ Molten salt Fig 1 Schematic diagram of the apparatus used for the isobutane/butene alkylaaon Table I Selected RON and MON values for alkylates Alkylate RON MON 2-Me-butane 92 3 90 5 2,3-dl-Me-butane 103 2 94 3 C6-C7 (others) 80 80 2,2,4-tn-Me-pentane 100 100 2,2,3-tn-Me-pentane 109 6 99 9 2,3,4-tn-Me-pentane 102 7 95 9 2,3,3-tn-Me-pentane 106 1 99 4 2,5-dl-Me-hexane 55 2 55 7 2,4-di-Me-hexane 65 2 69 9 2,3-Me-hexane 71 3 78 9 2,2-di-Me-hexane 72 77 2,2,5-tn-Me-hexane 91 88 Cq+ 80 80 C,2+ 80 80 157 158 Yves Chauvin et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994)155-165 was withdrawn and the catalyst reused A schematic diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 1. Samples of reaction mixture were dissolved in a known amount of nheptane (external standard) and analyzed by gas chromatography (FID detector, PONA, 50 m capillary column) Temperature programming (major compounds) 15 min at 40 C then 5 C/min up to 250 C, 2 min at 250 C then 5 C/min up to 270 C For the separation of 2,2,3-trimethylpentane (TMP) and 2,5-dimethylhexane (DMH) temperature programming 10 min at 70 C then 5 C /min up to 150 C, 2 min at 150 C then 10 C/min up to 280 C Iodine numbers were determined by the Wijs method Organic chlorine compounds present in alkylates were converted to chloride by being reacted with an excess of a sodium naphthalenide glyme solution, then titrated by potentiometry The research octane number (RON) and motor octane number (MON) of the samples were calculated using the selected values given in Table 1 3. Results It is obvious that in systems consisting of two liquid phases mass transfer is of great importance In an alkylation reaction, physical phenomena associated with acid/ hydrocarbon volume ratio and agitation have a strong effect on the quality and composition of the alkylate In order to compare our results with more conventional sulfuric acid catalyzed alkylation and despite the difference between the density and viscosity of the two catalysts, preliminary experiments were performed in the designed apparatus with 96% fresh sulfuric acid The results are reported in Table 2 Compared to the product distribution described in the literature [ 10], we produced a higher content of both light ends (CS to C7 isoparaffins) and heavy ends (C9+ isoparaffins), and lower amount of total TMP's The distribution of the different TMP isomers was not significantly affected Such results were not surprising due to the less favorable operating conditions (agitation, acid to hydrocarbon volume ratio) compared to those used in industrial processes. Thus, best results could be expected using molten salts in a well-mixing reactor 31 General comments Exploratory experiments with 1-butene showed that dimethylhexanes were obtained as predominant products Thus this reaction has not been developed In most of the experiments, the conversion of butene was quantitative (otherwise noted) In fact, olefins are so reactive towards acidic molten salts that practically no butene was found in the hydrocarbon phase using our analytical method Within the limits of experimental errors, yields of alkylates, calculated using internal and external standards, were nearly quantitative (in most of the experiments) and the iodine numbers of most of the alkylates were very low, ( < 5), which indicated that the level of unsaturation in the alkylate was low Yves Chauvin et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 92 (1994)155-165 159 Table 2 Product composition using 96% sulfuric acid as the catalyst' Product distribution Temperature ( C) +7 +15 +10 2-Me-butane 8 3 7 6 2,3-tit-Me-butane 5 8 5 8 C6-C7 (others) 8 3 7 3 Light ends 22 4 20 7 7 3 2,2,4-tn-Me-pentane 25 9 22 2 2,2,3-tn-Me-pentane 3 3 2 2,3,4-tn-Me-pentane 13 8 14 4 2,3,3-tn-Me-pentane 17 6 16 Total TMP's 60 6 54 6 80 2,5-di-Me-hexane 1 3 2 7 2,4-di-Me-hexane 2 6 2 5 2,3-di-Me-hexane 19 21 2,2-di-Me-hexane 2 Total DMH's 7 8 7 3 8 2,2,5-tn-Me-hexane 3 4 4 3 C9, (others) 5 5 12 2 C,Z+ < 1 < 1 Heavy ends < 8 9 < 17 5 4 4 Calculated RON 95 4 94 97 8 Calculated MON 92 6 91 2 93 9 'Conversion of isobutane=5% weight, LHSV=0 1 'Data from Albright [ 1 ] 94 4% sulfuric acid used, LHSV=0 3, isobutane/butene=7 2, agitation 1100 rpm, residence time= several minutes The chlorine content in the alkylate was between 40 and 80 ppm weight.

As the temperature increased in the range - 5 C to + 15 C, the percentages of light ends, DMH's and heavy ends all increased, and the TMP's fraction decreased The TMP's/ DMH's ratio dropped from 41 to 8 Low temperatures are favorable. 3 5 Effect of the feed rate (LHSV) The rate of addition of the feed had an important effect on the alkylation reaction as indicated in Table 3 for 0 60 N molten salts An LHSV of 1 90 caused an increased formation of C9+ at the expense of isooctane (essentially 2,2,4-TMP). This effect on the product distribution is irreversible the melt did not recover its selectivity after being contacted by a large amount of olefin This can probably be ascribed to the formation of polymeric species 3 6 Effect of residence time The evolution of the composition of the reaction products as the contact time of the products with the melt increased from several minutes to 12 hours is reported in Table 6 TMP's were degraded into essentially light ends (predominant products) and heavy ends The DMH's content increased so that the TMP's/DMH's ratio dropped from 13 to 2 The 2,2,3-TMP was not affected by increasing residence time (in the range of our investigations) As a comparison, Table 7 gives results of experiments obtained by reacting 2,2,4-TMP with a fresh molten salt in the presence or not of isobutane The conversion of 2,2,4-TMP was higher without dilution with isobutane With isobutane, 8% of the 2,2,4-TMP was converted in one hour, into isoparaffins identical to those formed during the standard alkylation 162 Yves Chauvin et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 92 (1994)155-165 Table 5 Effect of temperatures Product distribution Temperature /conversion of isobutane -15 C/3% -5 C/6% +5 C/4% +15 C/5% 2-Me-butane 1 1 1 2 1 6 5 7 2,3-di-Me-butane 2 3 2 5 3 3 3 2 C6-C7 (others) 1 6 2 2 7 4 6 Light ends 5 5 7 7 6 13 5 2,2,4-tn-Me-pentane 49 6 55 1 48 7 45 2 2,2,3-tri-Me-pentane 3 4 4 8 1 3 3 7 2,3,4-tri-Me-pentane 18 3 14 1 20 2 7 8 2,3,3-tn-Me-pentane 15 8 14 6 12 9 12 Total TMP's 87 1 88 6 83 1 68 7 2,5-di-Me-hexane 0 4 0 3 0 6 4 1 2,4-di-Me-hexane 0 9 0 5 0 4 4 2,3-di-Me-hexane 0 5 0 8 0 9 14 Total DMH's 1 8 1 6 1 9 9 5 2,2,5-tn-Me-hexane 1 3 1 6 2 2 2 6 C9+ (others) 3 7 2 1 3 4 3 4 C12+ 1 0 2 1 2 1 8 Heavy ends 6 3 9 6 8 7 8 Calculated RON 99 3 100 1 98 5 94 7 Calculated MON 96 5 97 4 95 8 92 8 aAIC13 molar fraction in the molten salt =0 60 Table 6 Effect of residence time' Product distribution Time (h) /conversion of isobutane < 1/3% 7/8 5% 12 /12% 2-Me-butane 4 1 12 8 22 2 2,3-di-Me-butane 2 1 4 4 C6-C7 (others) 3 9 3 12 8 Light ends 9 2 26 1 39 2,2,4-tn-Me-pentane 49 2 26 3 15 8 2,2,3-tn-Me-pentane 2 3 7 5 8 1 2,3,4-tn-Me-pentane 16 1 3 1 2 1 2,3,3-tn-Me-pentane 12 6 4 4 2 Total TMP's 79 6 43 30 2 2,5-di-Me-hexane 3 9 6 5 5 3 2,4-di-Me-hexane 3 9 3 7 2 2,3-di-Me-hexane 1 2 2 3 3 2 Total DMH's 7 2 18 1 15 7 2,2,5-tn-Me-hexane 1 4 5 4 5 4 C9+ (others) 1 4 9 7 5 C,Z+ 0 6 2 2 1 Heavy ends 3 1 12 3 15 Calculated RON 96 9 89 88 6 Calculated MON 94 7 87 5 87 1 aAICl3 molar fraction in the molten salt=0 60, T= +5 C, LH$V -0 4 7 h at +5 C, then 5 h at +25 C Yves Chauvin et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 92 (1994)155-165 163 Table 7 Degradation of 2,2,4-TMP m contact with molten salts Product distribution Isobutane/2,2,4-TMP molar ratio/conversion of 2,2,4-TMP 10/8% 0/27% isobutane 6 2-Me-butane 0 4 2 2,3-di-Me-butane 0 2 1 6 C6-C7 (others) 0 5 2 2 Light ends 1 1 11 8 2,2,4-tn-Me-pentane 92 73 5 2,2,3-tn-Me-pentane 0 8 0 6 2,3,4-tn-Me-pentane 1 6 1 6 2,3,3-tn-Me-pentane 2 3 0 7 2,5-di-Me-hexane 0 5 0 4 2,4-di-Me-hexane 0 4 0 2 2,3-di-Me-hexane 0 3 0 2 Total DMH's 1 2 0 8 2,2,5-tn-Me-hexane 0 3 3 5 C9+ (others) 04 72 C,Z, 0 3 1 Heavy ends 1 11 7 'l 1 TMP/acid, T= 25'C, AIC13 molar fraction m the melt =0 60, residence time =1 h reaction In the absence of isobutane, the isomenzatlon of the 2,2,4-TMP decreased, light ends and heavy ends were the major products formed Similar observations were described when sulfuric acid was used as the catalyst 4. Discussion of the results The general characteristics of the alkylatlon reaction catalyzed by aluminium chloride based salts are very similar to those previously observed with conventional liquid catalysts, I e , sulfuric and hydrogen fluoride acids (1) hydride transfer, then the yield of TMP's, increases with increasing acid strength, (11) low acidity probably favors proton transfer, then the formation of olefinlc compounds that are responsible for the formation of heavy ends, (111) at high acid strength cracking reactions become important and the level of light ends increases, (IV) increasing the temperature decreases the TMP's content Thus in order to obtain good selectivities the acidity of the catalyst has to be carefully controlled It has been found that HO dissolved in an acidic organochloroalumlnate molten salt is a Bronsted superacld, comparable in strength to e g , 100% HZS04 [ 11,12] lO Yves Chauvin et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994)155-165 Increasing the concentration of HCl and/or the molar fraction of AIC13 In the melt increased the Hammett acidity function to -15 (like liquid HF) and even to -18 Adding water in an acidic molten salt played a similar, but more complex, role to HCl [ 13 ] Thus, there are two ways of increasing the acidity of the melts, I e , increasing either the molar fraction of A1C13 or the concentration of protons Increasing the content of protons by increasing the level of water (in our case, water was dissolved in the isobutane used before starting the reaction and, sometimes, for washing the molten salts after every run) resulted in an increase in the butene conversion and a decrease in the rate of side reactions The same trends were observed by increasing the AIC13 molar fraction An important advantage of molten salts, compared to conventional AIC13 based catalysts, is that their acidity can be tuned with great precision, since they are liquid over a wide range of compositions Thus this is one of the most useful variables in maximizing alkylate quality In contrast to sulfunc acid alkylation, a good alkylate can be obtained with a not very good agitation (stirring bar) On the other hand, formation of \"red oils\" is minimized 5.
