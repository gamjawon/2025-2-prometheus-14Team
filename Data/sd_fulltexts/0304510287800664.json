(Received June 12, 1986;accepted August 27, 1986) Summary A water-soluble Wilkinson's complex, chlorotris(diphenylphosphino- benzene-m-sulphonate)rhodium(I) (Rl^CUdprr^3\"\"), was examined as a homogeneous catalyst for the reduction of water coupled with the photo- reaction of Ru(bpy)32\"1\" using ascorbic acid as a sacrificial electron donor. A high quantum yield of H; (440 nm), i.e. 0.30, was obtained at pH 5. This value was found to be limited by the photochemical generation of Ru- (bpy)3+, indicating that the catalytic process maintained by the rhodium complex is almost quantitative. Studies by cyclic voltammetry, laser flash photolysis and pulse radiolysis revealed the catalysis mechanism which involves a Rh(II)-hydride species. Introduction Although many studies of photochemical energy conversion and storage have been conducted in the past decade [1,2], typical low-valent organo- metallic homogeneous catalysts, such as Wilkinson's complex, have surpris- ingly not been tested as reducing catalysts of water. It may be simply be- cause most of them are not soluble in water. Attempts to use organic sol- vents miscible with water, such as acetonitrile or ethylene carbonate, for Wilkinson's complex gave only very low quantum yields of hydrogen [3]. We describe here the finding that a water-soluble Wilkinson's complex, chlorotris(diphenylphosphinobenzene-m-sulphonate)rhodium(I) (Rh'Cl- (dpm)33\") [4], works as a highly efficient catalyst for this step. Polypyridine or macrocyclic Co(II) complexes were reported to be used as homogeneous catalysts for this step, coupled with the photochemical system of Ru(bpy)32+-ascorbate [5, 6, 7]. We examined the rhodium com- plex as a substitute for the Co(II) complexes. *The research described herein was supported by the Office of Basic Energy Sci- ences of the Department of Energy.

[4]. The analytically pure anhydrous salt was obtained by recrystalliza- tion from THF-water and drying on P205 in vacuo at 60 C for 24 h. Ru- (bpy)3Cl2 was prepared by the reaction of an equivalent amount of bpy with RuCla^O in DMF at 120 C for 3 h. RecrystaUization from water and drying on P2C>5 in vacuo at 80 C gave the anhydrous complex. Purity was also checked by elemental analysis for C, H and N. The continuous photolysis system consisted of a 300-W (82 V) projec- tion lamp (General Electric) used at 50 V, a 50-mm cell containing distilled water, optical filters and a 10-mm reaction cell. Irradiation was carried out under vacuum with stirring, the reaction cell was then filled with argon to atmospheric pressure, and the resulting gaseous mixture was analyzed for hydrogen on a Varian 1700 gas chromatograph with a molecular sieve 5A column at 25 C, using argon as a carrier gas. For the measurement of quantum yield, a 440-nm interference filter (width at half-maximum: 8 nm) was used, and the light intensity was determined by ferrioxalate actinometry [8] as 4.4 X 10~8 einstein s~1. The laser flash photolysis experiments were carried out using a Molectron UV-400 nitrogen laser for excitation. The kinetic spectro- photometer and data collection system are described elsewhere [9,10]. Samples were purged of oxygen by bubbling with argon and flow regulated so as to be renewed for every excitation. For pulse radiolysis, electron pulses from the Notre Dame 7 MeV ARCO LP-7 linear accelerator were used. The description of the computer- controlled kinetic spectrophotometer and data collection system is available elsewhere [11,12]. The flow system was also adopted. Electrochemical experiments were conducted in a standard three- compartment cell with an SCE as reference electrode, using a CV-1B cyclic voltammograph (Bioanalytical System). DMF and tetra-n-butylammonium perchlorate were purified according to the description of Sawyer and Roberts [13]. Results and discussion In a typical experiment for hydrogen generation, an aqueous solution (4 ml) of ascorbic acid (AH2) (0.1 M) and Ru(bpy)32\"1\" (0.19 mM), adjusted 227 to pH 5 using NaOH, was degassed by several freeze-pump-thaw cycles, then the sodium salt of Rh'CUdpn^3\" (0.19 mM) was added. Irradiation of the solution (X > 408 nm) generated molecular hydrogen at a typical rate of 12 ml h~1. The evolution of hydrogen continued up to about 103 catalytic cycles, where one catalytic cycle of the rhodium complex is defined to give ^ mole of H;. The addition of dmp increased the number of catalytic cycles, indicating that the loss of catalytic activity corresponds to the de- composition of the original molecular system around Rh metal. Figure 1 shows the pH dependence of the quantum yield of H2 at 440 nm*. At the optimum pH, namely around 5, ^(H;) reaches almost 0.30. In addition, the quantum yield of Ru(bpy)3\"1\" at various pH was mea- sured for the system of AH; (0.1 M) and Ru(bpy)32\"1\" (0.2 mM) by a com- parative method with benzophenone [14-17]. As shown in Fig. 1, <I>(Ru- (bpy)3+) at pH 5-7 was also around 0.30. $(Hi) at pH 5, therefore, is limited by the generation of Ru(bpy)3\"1', suggesting that both electron trans- fer from Ru(bpy)34' to Rt^CKdpn^3\" (eqn. 3) and the succeeding reduction of H\"*\" are almost quantitative. In this connection, ^(H;), corrected for the fraction of the excited ruthenium complex unquenched by ascorbate, was reported to be 0.13 in the case of Co(II) [5], where a higher concentration of ascorbate, i.e., 0.7 M, was used.

In these experimental conditions, quenching of *Ru(bpy)32\"1\" by Rh^Udpn^a3\"\" is estimated to be less than 2% of that by ascorbate, and about 5% of the light is absorbed by the Rh complex, though no correc- tions for them have been made. In order to avoid pH change with the generation of hydrogen, the irradiation was limited to within 15 min, corresponding to 6 J-imol of hydrogen generation. 228 coincides with that of (^(Ri^bpsQa'1'), which in turn agrees with the decrease in concentration of ascorbate anion (AH~).

Since Rh'CUdpn^3\" is known not to dissociate dpm [4], and substitution of Cl did not occur,** the species to which an electron is transferred from Ru(bpy)34' is considered to maintain its original composition. The value of k(3) suggests a significant difference between the oxida- tion potential of Ru(bpy)3\"1' and the reduction potential of RI^CUdpn^3\". Attempted cyclic voltammetry for the rhodium complex in water or DMF did not show any significant redox current at cathodic potentials, regardless of using various electrodes or the addition of dpm. An efficient electron transfer in reaction 3, however, was confirmed by the fact that the CV curve of the reversible Ru(bpy)32+/Ru(bpy)3+ couple ( 1.2*** V us. SCE) in DMF at a platinum electrode lost the oxidation current in the presence of Rh'CUdpn^3\", and a small oxidation wave appeared at 0.7 V us. SCE, which might correspond to the oxidation of Rh^C^dpn^4\" (Fig. 2). It should also be noticed that the consumption of Ru(bpy)3\"1\" via reaction 3 at the electrode is so fast that it enhanced the reduction wave for Ru(bpy)32\"1\" and shifted its peak to a more anodic potential, to yield a catalytic cyclic voltammogram. Since the CV curve of Ru(bpy)3+/Ru(bpy)30 was not in- fluenced by Rl^CUdpn^3\"*\" except that it shifted to more negative in electric current, the electron transfer from Ru(bpy)3 to Rl^CUdpn^3\" can be considered to be slow. This seems to indicate the importance of electrostatic attraction in reaction 3. In Fig. 3, time-resolved differential spectra obtained by laser flash photolysis for an aqueous solution of AH2 (0.1 M), Ru(bpy)32\"1\" (0.04 mM) and Rh'CUdpn^3\"1\" (0.21 mM) at pH 5 are shown. The spectrum just after the laser pulse agrees with that of Ru(bpy)3\"1\" reported [15 -17], and a peak at 340 nm appears with the disappearance of Ru(bpy)3+.

This smaller value may be due to the higher ionic strength used [5]. **The UV-visible spectrum of an aqueous solution of Rl^CKdpn^3\", if evacuated strictly, was found to be stable, contrary to the observation reported by Joo et al.

Considering the following results obtained by pulse radiolysis for Rh'CUdpn^3\"\", the spectrum at 60 JUS has been con- cluded to consist of Rl^HCHdpn^a3\" and A\\ Aqueous solutions of Rh'CUdpn^3\" (0.12 mM) and t-butanol (0.2 M) buffered by phosphate (20 mM) were purged of oxygen by bubbling with argon, and then subjected to pulse radiolysis. As shown in Fig. 4, a transient generated immediately after the pulse (4 /xs) at pH 5.1, which gave a spec- trum identical with that obtained at pH 7.0, changed to a different species within 40 JUS (Xmax = 330 nm). The spectrum of this second transient has been observed to show little change in its shape and intensity up to 3.2 ms. On the other hand, at pH 7.0, the change to the second transient was so slow that the features of the first transient can be seen even in a spectrum at 3.2 ms, though its intensity has decreased, probably because of the reaction with oxygen as an impurity. These observations, in addition to the results in Fig. 1, can be most rationally explained by the mechanism wherein Rh^Cl- (dpm)33\" reacts with hydrated electron to give RhoCl(dpm)34~ as the first transient (eqn. 6), to which the 'oxidative coordination' of H\"*\" gives rise to Rl^HCKdpn^3- at pH 5 (eqn. 7, fe(7) = 6.0 X 109 M-1 s-1). In the case of 231 photochemical H^ generation, the formation of the hydride (eqn. 7) prevents the backward reaction of RhoCl(dpm)34- with A7 (eqn. 8).

It is known that the bimolecular reaction of Rh(III)-hydride needs heating to give H; [25], or concentrated hydrochloric acid is necessary to evolve Ha from Rh(I)-binuclear complex [26]. This is because these reactions involve the valence change of Rh to the II-state, which is unstable and corresponds to a radical [27]. It is reasonable to consider that the reaction from Rh(II)- state feasibly takes place, namely, that Rl^HCUdpn^3\" regenerates Rl^Cl- (dpm)33\"\" with formation of H; in mild conditions of pH and temperature (eqn.9). Additional studies aimed at the further characterization of these sys- tems, especially eqn. 9, are in progress. References 1 J. Kiwi, K. Kalyanasundaram and M. Gratzel, Struct.

        "dc:description": "A water-soluble Wilkinson's complex, chlorotris(diphenylphosphinobenzene-m-sulphonate)rhodium(I) (RhICl(dpm)3 3−), was examined as a homogeneous catalyst for the reduction of water coupled with the photoreaction of Ru(bpy)3 2+ using ascorbic acid as a sacrificial electron donor. A high quantum yield of H2 (440 nm), i.e. 0.30, was obtained at pH 5. This value was found to be limited by the photochemical generation of Ru(bpy)3 +, indicating that the catalytic process maintained by the rhodium complex is almost quantitative. Studies by cyclic voltammetry, laser flash photolysis and pulse radiolysis revealed the catalysis mechanism which involves a Rh(II)-hydride species.",
