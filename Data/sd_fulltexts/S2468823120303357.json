Graphical abstract With the assistance of nitrate additives (KNO3, NaNO3, Ca(NO3)2 or Mg(NO3)2), perovskite LaCoO3, which has a 3D porous structure and relatively high surface area (around 20 m2/g) was successfully synthesized at 500 °C via a sol-gel process. The results of thermal gravimetric analysis indicated that nitrates (especially NaNO3 and KNO3) acted as combustion aids, which significantly lowered down the crystallization temperature of LaCoO3 by intensifying the decomposition of organic ingredients. Unlike other researches, the metal ions from the nitrate additives did not dope into the crystal lattice of perovskite and it was found that the remained nitrate additives would dramatically inhibit the LaCoO3 catalytic activity on benzene oxidation. However, after removal of these remained nitrate additives by rinsing with deionized water, LaCoO3 derived from our proposed salt-assisted sol-gel method exhibited an excellent catalytic activity. Keywords Perovskite LaCoO3 Nitrate additives Low-temperature synthesis Combustion aid Benzene oxidation 1 Introduction The abatement of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [1], such as benzene, acetone and isopropanol have received growing attention since they were described as one of the major air pollutants which have been a significant threat to the environment as well as human health [2–4]. The catalytic oxidation of VOCs with low energy consumption and high purification efficiency is regarded as one of the most effective methods for the elimination of VOCs [5]. Perovskite-type oxides (PTOs), which are among the most promising catalysts for this treatment, are considered as alternatives for noble metals, mainly due to their ease of synthesis and low cost as compared to noble metals, while demonstrating good catalytic activity in deep oxidation of hydrocarbons [6–8]. PTOs are drawing more and more attention for their flexible electronic structure, which contributes to diverse physical and chemical properties, especially in catalysis [9]. In particularly, LaCoO3 exhibits excellent catalytic activity for oxidation [10,11]. However, LaCoO3 always tends to sinter at high crystallization temperature (above 600 °C) which causes its inherent low specific surface area (typically less than 5 m2/g) that limits its catalytic activity [6,12]. In order to improve the textural properties of LaCoO3, various approaches have been developed. For instance, perovskite LaCoO3 for CO gas sensor was prepared by an additional high energy ball milling step, resulting in an enhanced specific surface area (66 m2/g) [13]. Besides that, Wang et al. [14] used the mesoporous SiO2 (KIT-6, 916 m2/g) as template to fabricate mesoporous perovskite LaCoO3 with a high surface area of 270 m2/g. Yakovleva et al. [15] proposed a microwave treatment strategy for rapid crystallization and to limit the grain growth of LaCoO3, leading to a relatively high surface area of 34 m2/g. Among these methods, the hydroxy acid complexation route has the advantages of simple in operation and cheap in materials, making it a feasible method for scale-up preparation of PTOs with acceptable textural structure and physicochemical property [16]. On the other hand, metal ions, such as alkaline and alkaline earth metal ions, which serve as additives, have been widely used in perovskite to improve the catalytic performance. For instance, Ca2+ and Mg2+ have been extensively studied to substitute the metal in position A and/or B to improve the catalytic activity for oxidation reactions, such as the complete oxidation of CO [17], ethyl acetate [18], toluene [11], etc. Moreover, Na+ and K+ are not only substituted into the A site of PTOs lattice to generate more active surface oxygen species [19–21], but also are used as raw materials for molten-salt synthesis and salt-assisted solution combustion synthesis [22,23]. PTOs synthesized by the molten-salt method could reach a relatively high surface area (about 30 m2/g for LaCoO3) without using complexing agents during the process. However, this method consumes a large amount of nitrates (lanthanum nitrate, cobalt nitrate, NaNO3 and KNO3 were mixed in a molar ratio of 1: 1: 30: 30) as flux and requires a high calcination temperature (700 °C) [22]. Besides that, salt-assisted solution combustion synthesis is also adopted to prepare the PTOs. By adding fuels like ethylene glycol and sodium salt, PTOs could be obtained at a lower synthetic temperature (300 °C), but this method creates an impure crystal phase [24]. Furthermore, PTOs with porous structure could be obtained by the solution combustion synthesis with fuels like urea [25] and stearic acid [26]. However, in order to improve the crystallinity degree, additional calcination at high temperature is essential, but at the expense of decrease in the surface area of PTOs [23]. In our previous work, perovskite LaCoO3 with a relatively high surface area of 33 m2/g was biosynthesized at a low calcination temperature of 500 °C via the plant-mediated method. In this method, inorganic components (K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+) in plant extract together with NO3 − acted as combustion aids resulting in decreasing calcination temperature was demonstrated [27]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is limited literature focusing on the role of alkaline or alkaline earth metal nitrates with a single component on the low-temperature synthesis of perovskite LaCoO3. In this work, based on our previous studies, we systematically studied the role of alkaline or alkaline earth metal nitrates in the synthesis of LaCoO3 by citric acid complexation method. Besides that, a salt-assisted sol-gel strategy to facile fabrication of pure perovskite LaCoO3 at a low calcination temperature of 500 °C was proposed. In addition, the roles of nitrate additives in altering the activity in the catalytic combustion of benzene were investigated. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials Lanthanum nitrate, cobalt (II) nitrate, potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, calcium nitrate, magnesium nitrate and citric acid (CA) were purchased from Aladdin Chemicals Co. Ltd. All chemicals are of analytical grades and were used without further purification. 2.2 Catalyst preparation 2.2.1 Traditional sol-gel method For the control samples, the LaCoO3 was prepared by the traditional sol-gel method. The details were as follows: lanthanum nitrate, cobalt nitrate and CA (the molar ratio is 1: 1: 0.4) were dissolved in 20 mL deionized water and stirred vigorously at room temperature for 1 h to obtain precursor solution. After that, the solution was dried at 80 °C for 24 h to get a dry gel, which was then calcinated at 500 or 700 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 5 °C/min to get LaCoO3 (denoted as LCO-500 and LCO-700, respectively). 2.2.2 Salt-assisted sol-gel method In order to decrease the calcination temperature, a salt-assisted sol-gel method was proposed. Specifically, for the target samples, the above traditional sol-gel processes were adopted, except that nitrate additives were added into the precursor solution as shown in Scheme 1 . The molar ratio of metal ions (K+, Na+, Ca2+ or Mg2+) to La3+ and the labels of these samples are listed in Table 1 . All the samples were rinsed with deionized water after calcination at 500 °C. In order to determine the role of concentration of complexing agent, precursor solution with a lower CA concentration (the molar ratio of La3+ to CA is 1: 0.2) and a higher CA concentration (the molar ratio of La3+ to CA is 1: 0.6) were adopted to prepare the samples of 0.134Na-LCO-D and 0.134Na-LCO-I, respectively, where the prefix number denoted the amount of NaNO3 added (the molar ratio of La3+ to Na+ is 1: 0.134). Similarly, the sample names of 0.1Na-LCO, 0.2Na-LCO and 0.3Na-LCO denote different NaNO3 concentrations, corresponding to the molar ratio of Na+: La3+ ranged from 0.1 to 0.3. Besides that, in order to examine the influence of calcination temperature, the calcination temperature of Na-LCO was raised to 700 °C, which was denoted as Na-LCO-700. In addition, the role of rinsing (with deionized water) on catalytic performance was investigated by different samples derived from the following experiment. Na-LCO sample was stirred in deionized water and extra NaNO3 (the molar ratio of La3+: Na+ is still 1: 0.134 in theory) was added into the water. Upon drying and calcination, a new sample was obtained (denoted as Na-LCO(with ashes)). Similarly, Na-LCO(with ashes) was rinsed with deionized water and was denoted as Na-LCO(clean). The Na-LCO sample before rinsing was labeled as Na-LCO-NW. 2.3 Catalyst characterization All the X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on an X’Pert Pro X-ray Diffractometer (PANalytical BV, The Netherlands) with a Cu Ka radiation target (35 kV, 15 mA). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ZEISS SIGMA, Germany) was used to observe the catalysts’ morphologies. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of the catalysts were taken on a Tecnai F30 microscope. The thermal properties of catalysts were measured by the thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA, SDT Q600, USA). Nitrogen adsorption-desorption curve was measured at 77 K on a BELSORP-mini II instrument and all of the catalysts were degassed at 250 °C for 3 h before measurement. The adsorption branch in the P/P0 ranged from 0.05 to 0.30, and specific surface areas of the catalysts were calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) performed by Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 apparatus was used to test the redox properties of the catalysts. 50 mg of the samples was placed in a quartz reactor and pretreated with He (30 mL/min) at 300 °C for 0.5 h, which was then cooled down to room temperature. After that, the reactor was heated to 900 °C at a constant rate of 10 °C/min under a mixture of 10 vol% H2/Ar (30 mL/min). Oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD) was carried out by using the same apparatus as H2-TPR. After pretreatment with 3 vol%, O2/He at 300 °C for 0.5 h, the sample (80 mg) was cooled down to room temperature and was purged with He (40 mL/min) for 0.5 h. After that, the reactor was heated to 900 °C at a constant rate of 10 °C/min. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Physical Electronics, USA) detected the representative catalysts, using Al Kα (1486.7 eV) as excitation source and C 1s 284.8 eV was taken as a reference for the binding energy calibration. 2.4 Catalytic performance test The catalytic activity tests were performed on a continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactor (i.d. = 10 mm) at atmospheric pressure. In each run, 50 mg of catalyst was loaded into the reactor and the catalyst bed temperature was measured exactly by a thermocouple. The feed gas consisted of 100 ppm benzene and air was fed into the reactor at a rate of 2000 mL/min by a mass flow controller. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was 40,000 mL/(g h). The test of catalytic activity was made after 0.5 h at each measured temperature and the inlet and outlet concentration of benzene was measured by an on-line gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) to calculate the benzene conversion rate. (1) C 6 H 6 conversion rate = C 6 H 6 inlet - C 6 H 6 outlet C 6 H 6 inlet ×100% 3 Result and discussion 3.1 The effect of nitrate additives on catalysts preparation XRD tests were employed to determine the crystal phase composition of our synthesized samples, the results are given in Fig. 1 . Firstly, as shown in Fig. 1a, the sample (LCO-500) synthesized with the traditional sol-gel method at 500 °C showed the main crystal phase of perovskite LaCoO3 (JCPDS No. 48-0123), while some excess peaks, especially at 2θ = 30° were clearly observed. However, a pure phase of LaCoO3 was obtained when the calcination temperature was raised to 700 °C (LCO-700), demonstrating that it was difficult to synthesize pure LaCoO3 at low temperature via the traditional method, which is similar to our previous study [27]. Surprisingly, with the addition of KNO3 (K-LCO) or NaNO3 (Na-LCO), LaCoO3 with pure perovskite phase was obtained at a relatively low calcination temperature of 500 °C. As for the sample of Ca-LCO and Mg-LCO, despite some excess diffraction peaks were still observed, these peaks became weaker as compared with LCO-500, meanwhile, the peaks for LaCoO3 became sharper. Therefore, the introduction of nitrates into traditional sol-gel method could promote the formation of perovskite LaCoO3 at 500 °C. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1b, pure perovskite LaCoO3 could be obtained by adding NaNO3 with the ratio of Na+ to La3+ ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 (0.1Na-LCO, 0.2Na-LCO and 0.3Na-LCO), where the molar ratio of CA to La3+ was 0.4. However, distinct excess diffraction peaks were observed when the CA concentration increased (0.134Na-LCO-I, La3+: CA = 1: 0.6) or decreased (0.134Na-LCO-D, La3+: CA = 1: 0.2). In fact, when the ratio was fixed at La3+: CA = 1: 0.6, a pure phase of LaCoO3 could also be achieved after carefully adjusting the ratio of Na+ to La3+ to 0.179 (shown in Fig. S1), which was previously reported by us [27]. Thus, the CA concentration was deduced to significantly affect the crystal phase of samples synthesized by salt-assisted sol-gel method at low temperature, and the optimal molar ratio of CA to La3+ is 0.4. In order to investigate the role of nitrate additives, thermal analysis was tested for gels that were collected from the samples of LCO-500, Ca-LCO and Na-LCO before calcination (marked as LCO-gel, Ca-LCO-gel and Na-LCO-gel, respectively). As shown in Fig. 2 b, the decomposition of LCO-gel occurred in the following four steps. Firstly, the initial weight loss peaks appeared at 139 °C and 169 °C, where the former is attributed to the loss of crystal water (from cobalt nitrate hydrate [28] and lanthanum nitrate hydrate [29]) and the latter is caused by the decomposition of a portion of CA [30,31]. Secondly, in the range of 200−350 °C, a drastic weight loss found in TG curves (shown in Fig. 2a) is ascribed to the decomposition of crystal water from La(NO3)3 xH2O (x < 0.4) [29] at around 265 °C and binary metal-ion complex [32,33] at 300 °C, in which vast quantities of gases (H2O, N2 and CO2) are released. Next, a small number of carbonates that were absorbed on the surface of oxide powders were eliminated [32], causing a slight weight loss at 540 °C. Finally, when the temperature of heat treatment exceeded 600 °C, weight loss could be hardly observed, indicating that perovskite LaCoO3 was formed. Obviously, it could be observed that after adding NaNO3, different weight loss peaks in the temperature range of 250−300 °C merged into one peak, and the corresponding decomposition temperature was found to decrease from 300 °C (LCO-gel) to 280 °C (Na-LCO-gel). Besides that, almost no weight loss was observed at 500 °C, indicating perovskite LaCoO3 was completely formed at a low temperature. However, the weight loss of Ca-LCO-gel were found to be almost the same as that of LCO-gel, which implies the poorer combustion aid effect of Ca(NO3)2 than that of NaNO3. Hence, it is deduced that the nitrate additives, especially NaNO3, act as a combustion aid resulted in the low-temperature crystallization of perovskite LaCoO3 by intensifying the decomposition of organic ingredients (i.e. CA) during calcination, accompanying with a large amount of gases and heat released. The morphology of representative samples was observed by SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 3 a, an agglomerate morphology with few holes was obtained for LCO-700, which might be resulted from its higher calcination temperature and moderate gas release during calcination. Meanwhile, the TEM image (Fig. 3d) shows that LOC-700 consists of large particles with the size > 100 nm. In contrast, a 3D porous structure (with many holes of varying size) was obviously observed from the SEM images of Na-LCO and Na-LCO-700 (Fig. 3b and c), and stacked nanoparticles without agglomeration were observed in TEM images (Fig. 3e and f). In addition, the diameter of nanoparticles of Na-LCO is less than 20 nm, while that of Na-LCO-700 is around 50 nm, demonstrating the size of LaCoO3 nanoparticles can be increased by elevating the calcination temperature. Therefore, nitrate additives could not only construct a porous structure by the intense liberation of gases during the calcination process but also lower the crystallization temperature to limit the growth of nanoparticles, which are difficult to be achieved by traditional sol-gel method. However, porous structures with some visible agglomerate particles could be observed in the SEM images of Ca-LCO and Mg-LCO (Fig. S2), proving that NaNO3 and KNO3 have stronger combustion aid effect than that of Ca(NO3)2 and Mg(NO3)2 in the synthesis of LaCoO3, which agrees well with the results of XRD and TG. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements for representative samples were carried out to further determine their textural properties, and the results are given in Fig. 4 . It could be seen that all isotherms corresponded to the type IV of the IUPAC classification. It should be noted that there is an obvious hysteresis loop at P/P0  = 0.9–1.0 for each sample, which is attributed to the gaps stacked by nanoparticles [35], consistent with the SEM and TEM observation. The corresponding textural properties that were estimated from the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms are summarized in Table 2 . The sample synthesized by traditional sol-gel method (LCO-700) has a low surface area of 6.9 m2/g. However, the surface area of the sample synthesized with nitrate additives at 500 °C (Na-LCO) dramatically increases to 18.9 m2/g. In addition, Na-LCO has the highest pore volume (0.171 cm3/g) and average pore radius (36.0 nm), accompanying with the widest distribution of pore size (ranging from 10 to 120 nm, shown in the inset of Fig. 4). Obviously, these textural properties of Na-LCO should be ascribed to its rich porous structure and fine nanoparticles. It is worth noting that a limited increase in surface area for Na-LCO-700 (9.4 m2/g) indicates that the surface area of LaCoO3 could be effectively elevated by decreasing its crystallization temperature. Based on the above results, it could be concluded that with the aid of nitrate additives, perovskite LaCoO3 could be facilely synthesized via sol-gel method at a low calcination temperature of 500 °C, and a possible mechanism is proposed. It is generally accepted that CA works as the complexing agent which helps La3+ and Co2+ form a homogeneous gel with excellent dispersion of these two elements [27]. It is worth noting that CA is an organic matter and could act as a reducing agent. On the other hand, nitrates especially NaNO3 and KNO3 have strong oxidizing ability, which can easily cause burning or explosion when they rub or collide with organic matters. Therefore, after adding a suitable amount of nitrates, an enhanced oxidation atmosphere is locally formed and the decomposition of CA would be significantly accelerated. Benefited from this, the intensive heat release facilitates the uniform crystallization of LaCoO3 and a porous structure is caused by the rapid release of gases during the calcination process. However, the oxidizing ability of alkaline earth nitrates (Ca(NO3)2 or Mg(NO3)2) is lower than that of alkali metal nitrates (NaNO3 or KNO3). Therefore, the combustion aid effect of former is poorer than the latter [34]. 3.2 The effect of nitrate additives on catalytic performance The catalytic activities of the samples for benzene oxidation were tested in the reaction temperature ranged of 175−350 °C and the results are given in Fig. 5 . As shown in Fig. 5a, LCO-700 shows a low catalytic activity with benzene conversion of only 74 % at 350 °C, and the sample synthesized with the aid of NaNO3 at 500 °C without rinsing (Na-LCO-NW) was found to have almost no benzene conversion. However, upon being rinsed, the obtained sample (Na-LCO) demonstrated a dramatically enhanced catalytic activity with T90 (the reaction temperature where the benzene conversion rate reaches 90 %) = 300 °C. In addition, K-LCO (T90 = 305 °C) exhibited a similar catalytic performance to Na-LCO, which might be ascribed to their similar crystal phases and textural properties. Whereas porous structures with some agglomerate particles could be observed for both Ca-LCO and Mg-LCO (Fig. S2) and an agglomerate morphology with few holes was obtained for LCO-700 sample (Fig. 3a). Therefore, Ca-LCO and Mg-LCO exhibited enhanced catalytic performance with T90 of 325 °C and 330 °C compared with the control sample of LCO-700 (T90 > 350 °C). Furthermore, the stability of Na-LCO was tested by a time-on-stream experiment in which the catalyst was kept on-line at 300 °C for 80 h. As shown in Fig. 5c, the catalyst showed no sign of deactivation, with the benzene conversion maintaining around 90 % throughout the run, and the spent catalyst showed almost the same XRD diffraction peaks (the insert in Fig. 5c). This indicates that the perovskite structure was very stable during the reaction. Fig. 5d and the inset show the SEM and TEM image of the spent Na-LCO, respectively. No obvious particle aggregation was observed and the porous structure was well reserved. Therefore, the catalysts synthesized with the aid of nitrates at 500 °C have excellent thermal stability in catalytic oxidation. It is worth noting that rinsing with deionized water is essential to gain a high catalytic activity for the sample synthesized with the aid of NaNO3. Although the reduction of NaNO3 to NaNO2 might occur during the calcination process, upon exposure to the air, the NaNO2 would be easily oxidized to NaNO3 [34]. It could be expected that ashes (like NaNO3) were removed by rinsing, thereby the catalytic performance of LaCoO3 was dramatically improved. To prove this, Na-LCO was mixed with 20 mL NaNO3 solution, keeping the same ratio of La3+ to Na+ as that in the synthesis of Na-LCO. Thereafter the mixture was dried at 80 °C and calcinated at 500 °C to obtain a catalyst with ashes (marked as Na-LCO(with ashes)). Finally, Na-LCO(with ashes) was rinsed with water and dried to obtain a catalyst without ashes (marked as Na-LCO(clean)). The catalytic performances of these two samples are shown in Fig. 5b, and as expected, Na-LCO(with ashes) showed little catalytic activity toward benzene oxidation, while Na-LCO(clean) demonstrated very high catalytic performance, which was similar to that of Na-LCO-NW and Na-LCO, respectively. Moreover, the XRD patterns of different catalysts before rinsing had been tested (shown in Fig. S3) and showed the same results as the washed ones, indicating that the crystal phase of LaCoO3 is not affected by rinsing. In heterogeneous catalysis, the performance of the catalysts is closely related to their surface properties. To shed more light on the catalytic behavior of representative samples, XPS was used to determine their surface element and chemical information, in which the results are shown in Fig. 6 . From the survey spectra (Fig. 6a), La 3d (834 eV), Co 2p (780 eV), O 1s (530 eV), and Na 1s (1070 eV) were detected for Na-LCO-NW, and after being rinsed, the peak of Na was found to disappear. It can be clearly observed from the Na 1s spectra of these two samples as shown in Fig. 6b. Thus, most of the residual Na+ was removed upon rinsing with deionized water, indicating that Na+ was not doped into the LaCoO3 lattice, which was different from some previous reports. In other research, Na+ was successfully doped into PTOs like KTaO3 due to the same charges and similar ionic radii between Na+ and K+ [36]. Besides that, Na+ could also be doped into the crystal lattice of CH3NH3PdI3 for the reason that the ionic radius of Na+ is much smaller than that of CH3NH3 +. However, Na+ was mainly incorporated into the interstitial site of CH3NH3PdI3 rather than substituting the CH3NH3 + site [37]. After Na+ doping, the crystal cell of perovskite is either expanded or contracted, resulting in the slight shift of XRD diffraction peaks. However, as shown in Fig. S4, no shift could be observed among the XRD patterns of Na-LCO-NW, Na-LCO and LCO-700, which further proved that there was no Na+ doping for Na-LCO. And this undoped phenomenon was also reported by Wang and Ma, which demonstrated that Na+ and K+ could not dope into the perovskite structure of LaCoO3 due to the great differences in ionic radii and charges [22]. Therefore, by combining with the aforementioned results of catalytic performance, it could be deduced that the excellent catalytic performance of Na-LCO is mainly credited with the enhanced textural properties derived from porous structure rather than alkali metal doping. For the poor catalytic performance of Na-LCO-NW, it is postulated that the residual NaNO3 additive which is barely active towards benzene oxidation covers the surface of perovskite LaCoO3, making it difficult for adsorption, internal diffusion as well as the surface reaction of benzene and causing the poor catalytic performance [38]. However, upon washing with deionized water, most of NaNO3 is dissolved in water and the surface of LaCoO3 is fully exposed, leading to the significant increase in the catalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 6c, the XPS spectra for O 1s could be decomposed into two peaks (BE = 531.0 eV and 528.6 eV, respectively), in which the former is assigned to chemically adsorbed oxygen (Oads, e.g., O2 −, O2 2−, O−) and the latter is surface lattice oxygen (Olatt, e.g., O2−) [39]. However, for Na-LCO-NW, with the residue of NaNO3 on the surface, a small peak derived from NO3 − (BE =532.4 eV) was observed [40]. Element analysis via XPS indicated that the Oads/Olatt ratio of Na-LCO is 2.16, which was much higher than that of LCO-700 (1.45) and Na-LCO-NW (1.08), corresponding to the results of catalytic performance and demonstrating that Na-LCO owns more electrophilic oxygen species Oads on its surface that leads to superior catalytic activity for benzene oxidation [35]. Meanwhile, the Co 2p spectra, as displayed in Fig. 6d, shows a multiple splitting at 794.1 and 778.5 eV which corresponds to 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 level, respectively [41]. Besides that, two overlapped peaks are separated from the peak of 2p3/2, corresponding to Co3+ (BE =779.6 eV) and Co2+ (BE =781.7 eV) and the Co2+/Co3+ ratio of Na-LCO, LCO-700 and Na-LCO-NW amount to 1.00, 0.71 and 0.44, respectively [42]. The transition of B-site ions from Co3+ to Co2+ promotes the formation of oxygen vacancy due to the electroneutrality [27], which is also beneficial to the enhancement of completely catalytic oxidation activity. In order to test the redox properties of the samples, H2-TPR experiments were conducted. As shown in Fig. 7 a, all the samples experience two successive reduction steps. The first step at low temperature ranged of 250−400 °C is mainly attributed to the removal of active oxygen species in the surface around 300 °C as well as the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ with increasing temperature [43]. While the second step at high temperature (T > 400 °C) is caused by the reduction of Co2+ to Co°, accompanied by the decomposition of the perovskite structure [43,44]. For Na-LCO, the initial reduction peak area at low temperature, which represents the H2 consumption for reduction of adsorbed oxygen species, is much larger than that of LCO-700 and Na-LCO-NW, indicating more active oxygen species on the surface of Na-LCO, and this agreed well with the results of XPS. In order to have a good insight into this mechanism, a quantitative analysis [43] for H2-TPR results was carried out. By neglecting the reduction of active oxygen species, the reduction process during the H2-TPR experiments could be described as following: (2) 2LaCoO3 + H2 → 2LaCoO2.5 + H2O (3) 2LaCoO2.5 + 2H2 → La2O3 + 2Co + 2H2O Based on the above reactions, the H2 consumption in Step 2 (Eq. 3, named as CStep 2) is theoretically to be twice as much as that in Step 1 (Eq. 2, named as CStep 1), and the calculated CStep 2/CStep 1 ratio for LCO-700 is quite close to the theoretical value of 2 (Fig. 7a). This indicates a low chemisorbed oxygen concentration on the surface of LCO-700 since the active oxygen species could also be reduced in relatively low temperature under hydrogen atmosphere. By contrast, CStep 2/CStep 1 ratio for Na-LCO is 1.78 (lower than 2), which can be ascribed to more active oxygen species existing on the surface of Na-LCO. For Na-LCO-NW, however, the CStep 2/CStep 1 ratio is higher than 2, which might be attributed to that the residual NaNO3 covers the surface of LaCoO3 and thus not only causes less adsorbed oxygen species but also hinders the reduction of Co3+ in Step 1 [45]. O2-TPD measurements were employed to investigate the oxygen vacancy concentrations of samples. As shown in Fig. 7b, there are three typical kinds of oxygen species, namely α oxygen (T < 400 °C), β oxygen (400 < T < 700 °C) and γ oxygen (T > 700 °C), respectively [46]. The α oxygen is ascribed to the oxygen chemically adsorbed on the surface (O2 −), the β oxygen is assigned to the oxygen vacancy (O2 2-/O−), and the γ oxygen could be related to lattice oxygen (O2-) [27]. During the catalytic combustion process, α oxygen and β oxygen were found to play a dominant role in the oxidation of reactants [47]. It is obvious that the β oxygen content of Na-LCO is extraordinarily high as compared to that of LOC-700 and Na-LCO-NW, indicating that rich active oxygen species exist on its surface, which agrees well with its superb catalytic oxidation performance. The amount of adsorbed oxygen O2 − was found to be essentially proportional to the BET surface area [48], which indicates that Na-LCO has more active oxygen species on the surface mainly due to its higher surface area (Table 2). Besides that, for LaCoO3, visible lattice oxygen (γ oxygen) was supposed to be released at the high temperature of around 700 °C [27,46], however, as compared with Na-LCO and LCO-700, only a little γ oxygen could be observed for Na-LCO-NW, which might be ascribed to the fact that part of LaCoO3 was covered by NaNO3, limiting the exposure of active sites and the release of oxygen species [49]. 4 Conclusion In summary, by adding nitrate additives (KNO3, NaNO3, Ca(NO3)2 or Mg(NO3)2) into the sol-gel route, we developed a facile method to synthesize perovskite LaCoO3 with pure phase at a relatively low calcination temperature of 500 °C. The results of X-ray diffraction measurement and thermal gravimetric analysis demonstrated that nitrate additives (especially KNO3 or NaNO3) acted as combustion aids which aggravated the decomposition of CA accompanying with plenty of heat and gases released, resulting in the low crystallization temperature of perovskite LaCoO3. Benefitting from such low crystallization temperatures, LaCoO3 with a 3D porous structure and relatively high specific surface areas (around 20 m2/g) was obtained. Besides that, according to the results of XPS, H2-TPR and O2-TPD, the nitrate additives which were remained on the surface of catalysts inhibited their catalytic performance for benzene oxidation. Nevertheless, a simple post-treatment of rinsing with deionized water could effectively remove the residues, which dramatically enhanced the catalytic activity of LaCoO3 derived from salt-assisted sol-gel process. We believed that this salt-assisted sol-gel process would play an important role in the low-temperature synthesis of PTOs.

        "dc:description": "With the assistance of nitrate additives (KNO3, NaNO3, Ca(NO3)2 or Mg(NO3)2), perovskite LaCoO3, which has a 3D porous structure and relatively high surface area (around 20 m2/g) was successfully synthesized at 500 °C via a sol-gel process. The results of thermal gravimetric analysis indicated that nitrates (especially NaNO3 and KNO3) acted as combustion aids, which significantly lowered down the crystallization temperature of LaCoO3 by intensifying the decomposition of organic ingredients. Unlike other researches, the metal ions from the nitrate additives did not dope into the crystal lattice of perovskite and it was found that the remained nitrate additives would dramatically inhibit the LaCoO3 catalytic activity on benzene oxidation. However, after removal of these remained nitrate additives by rinsing with deionized water, LaCoO3 derived from our proposed salt-assisted sol-gel method exhibited an excellent catalytic activity.",
