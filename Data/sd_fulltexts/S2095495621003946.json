Graphical abstract 3D TED-HCS is successfully prepared via a single template of spherical CoP particles. As expected, the TED-HCS||AC PIHC exhibits a high energy density, power density and ultralong cycling performance. Integrating the merits of long lifespan and excellent energy as well as power densities, potassium-ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) exhibit great prospects for future energy storage devices. To boost comprehensive performance of PIHCs, heteroatom-doping and morphology-tuning as two comprehensive strategies have been devoted to designing uniquely structural carbon-based materials with favorable advantages. An ideal strategy for simultaneous atomic doping and structural regulation is expected to be developed. Herein, we propose a novel “Killing Two Birds with One Stone” strategy to prepare a tri-elements doped hollow carbon sphere (TED-HCS) as PIHCs anodes, that is, a single template of spherical CoP particles is rationally adopted, which not only provides both a P source for heteroatom-doping but also acts as a self-sacrificial template for hollow-structure engineering. The multifunctional TED-HCS presents a high capacity of 473.0 mAh g−1 and excellent rate performance of 212.5 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1. Remarkably, the as-assembled PIHCs show outstanding energy/power density (40.4 Wh kg−1/10500 W kg−1) and remain high-capacity retention of 89.15% even cycling 12,000 times. The “Killing Two Birds with One Stone” strategy offers new insight into the search for the preparation of carbon-based materials with multi-elements doping and specific morphology structure. Keywords Capacitors Potassium-ion Doping Carbon material Anode 1 Introduction Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely utilized in various energy storage devices due to their high mass-energy density, volumetric energy density, and environmental friendliness [1]. Unfortunately, Li resources with uneven distribution and the increasing cost of a lithium salt (Li2CO3) will limit the sustainable development of LIBs [2]. It creates the seek of novel battery system based on abundant elements resources in the Earth’s crust as an alternative for LIBs to solve this dilemma. Based on this key point, owing to its abundant Earth’s resource of element K and low cost of K carbonate, potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) gain much more attention recently [3,4]. More importantly, PIBs exhibits similar physicochemical properties with LIBs and relatively low reaction potential (−2.94 V (K/K+) vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)), implying that PIBs can afford high energy density in theory [5–7]. However, the relatively low power density and short cycle life of PIBs will impede their future development, especially the application in new energy vehicles. In comparison, potassium-ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs), combining the advantages of high-energy–density with high-power-density as well as long lifespan, exhibit great prospects for the next-generation high-performance energy storage devices [8,9]. Unfortunately, the ion radius of K+ reach to 1.38 Å, which is bigger than Li+ (0.76 Å), which is not conducive to the insertion of K+ into most electrode materials, even if K+ can be inserted into the electrode material, it will cause a huge volume change of the electrode material, and thus resulting in its low specific capacity, poor rate performance, and short cycling life [10]. It is crucial to enhance the comprehensive K+ storage properties through designing and developing novel structured electrode materials. Over the past few years, carbonaceous materials, compared with other anodic materials (such as metal chalcogenides/oxides [11,12], phosphorous [13], and alloys [14]), are considered as the best option for PIBs owing to environmental friendliness, abundant resources, and low cost [15–18]. However, the commercial LIBs anode, graphite only exhibits a relatively low capacity of 279 mAh g−1 for PIBs, which means that this reversible capacity is only 75% of graphite in LIBs [19,20]. Additionally, the cycling life and rate property of graphite as an anode for PIBs are also far worse than it as a LIB’ anode, which is mainly attributed to the bigger radius of K+ and consequently affects its migration kinetics in graphite with a small carbon interlayer spacing structure (0.334 nm) as well as inducing huge volume expansion during the potassiation/depotassiation process [21]. To overcome this obstacle, morphology designing and composition tuning (heteroatom doping) are two commonly strategies currently. Doping heteroatom-doping (N, S, O, P, etc.) into carbon-based electrode materials is an effective strategy for introducing reaction sites and abundant defects, along with modifying the interlayer spacing of carbon [22,23]. For instance, He et al. [22] prepared N/P dual-doped carbon with honeycomb-like structure, exhibiting high capacity of 419 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and outstanding rate performance (a high capacity of 270.4 mAh g−1 at the current density of 1.0 A g−1). Additionally, Chen et al. [23] prepared hard carbon microspheres with S/O dual-doped and pore structure through carbonization of the polymer microspheres, which can effectively enhance K+ storage performance. The current research work about element-doping mainly focuses on a single element or double elements doping, while few explorations on tri-element doped carbon-based materials have been reported in PIBs due to its complex preparation process. Therefore, designing a facile preparation process for tri-elements doping of carbon materials is very necessary. Additionally, morphology tuning has another way to boost the electrochemical property of carbon anode [24]. For example, the nanowall- and nanoflakes-like carbon materials as two counterparts at 30 A g−1 both exhibit low reversible capacity, but the carbon with the nanohoneycomb-like structure can displays a higher capacity of 420 mAh g−1 under the same testing condition of 30 A g−1 [24]. Based on our previous work, the hollow structure can strongly contact with the electrolyte and provide abundant active sites for K+ as well as offer a fast electrochemical response [25]. Obviously, carbon materials with both hollow structure and tri-elements doping are very harsh for the preparation conditions. Most of importance, an ideal strategy for simultaneous atomic doping and structural regulation is expected to be developed. In this work, a “killing Two Birds with One Stone” strategy is first proposed to prepare unique structural carbon-based electrodes for superior K+ storage, i.e., a three-dimensional tri-elements (N, P, and O) doped hollow carbon sphere (TED-HCS) is synthesized through a single template CoP. Herein, the spherical CoP particles not only act as a P source for P-doping during the calcination process but also as a self-sacrificial template to create hollow structure during the etching process. As expected, benefiting from the synergistic effect of tri-elements doping and hollow structure, the TED-HCS electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in PIBs. In addition, the TED-HCS||AC PIHC exhibits a high energy (215 Wh kg−1)/power density (10500 W kg−1) and maintains an ultrahigh capacity retention of 89.15% even cycling to 12,000 times. Thus, this extraordinary conclusion offers an approach to the composition/shape tuning of carbon-based materials with both multi-elements doping and specific morphology structure for high energy and power density as well as long lifespan of PIHCs. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of CoP Five mmol of CoCl2·6H2O and 25 mmol of NaH2PO2 were poured into a glass bottle and shaken thoroughly. The mixture powder was transferred into a porcelain crucible and than treated under 300 °C for 1 h in the atmosphere of argon. After cooling to 25 °C, the obtained powder was washed several times with distilled water and than dried overnight in a vacuum at 70 °C. After that, the CoP can be obtained. 2.2 Synthesis of TED-HCS sample A TED-HCS was prepared via a coating-carbonization-etching method. First, CoP particles (100 mg) were dispersed in 40 mL DI water. Then, 320 μL of pyrrole was added to this dispersion. After stirring for 10 min, 1.05 g of (NH4)2S2O8 is slowly added. After that, a CoP@PPy precursor can be obtained after stirring for 5 h and then washing with ethanol and DI water. The CoP@PPy precursor was transferred into a porcelain crucible and heated to 300 °C (5 h) under the atmosphere of Ar/H2 (H2: 5%). After 3 h, heating to 850 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1 and keeping 4 h. After cooling to room temperature, the CoP@PPy was changed to CoP@TED-HCS. Finally, the CoP in the CoP@TED-HCS is etched using HNO3. After dried at 80 °C for 24 h, the TED-HCS can be obtained. The tap density of the fabricated TED-HCS is 0.155 g cm−3. 3 Results and discussion The TED-HCS is prepared via a polymerization-calcination-etching method and the schematic diagram of the preparation process is shown in Fig. 1 . Firstly, spherical CoP is generated by a one-step phosphorylation process. During this process, sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2·H2O) is decomposed to a small amount of PH3 and then reacted with cobalt tetrahydrate chloride (CoCl2·6H2O) during high temperature. Uniquely, these spherical CoP particles act simultaneously as a P-doping source and a self-sacrificing template for the hollow structure. Subsequently, the surface of CoP particle is uniformly covered with a layer of polypyrrole (CoP@PPy) with a cross-linked structure via a facile polymerization process. It can be easily observed that the color of the CoP is gradually becoming black since pyrrole monomer is polymerized to polypyrrole under the reaction of the oxidant (ammonium thiosulfate). Then, the CoP@PPy precursor is carbonized to obtain CoP@TED-HCS under high temperature in the atmosphere of argon. During this high-temperature carbonization process, the P elements, which form the inner CoP particles, can be easily doped into the outer N-doped amorphous carbon. Finally, TED-HCS is successfully prepared by etching with nitric acid (HNO3). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is employed to analyze the morphology of the synthesized CoP, CoP@TED-HCS, and TED-HCS samples. The spherical CoP particles synthesized by solid-phase sintering is uniformly distributed with no obvious agglomeration, as shown in Fig. S1. In addition, the diameter of the CoP particles is around 200 nm. After coating with PPy and then the carbonization process, the CoP@TED-HCS can still maintain a spherical and cross-linked structure (Fig. 2 a). In Fig. 2(b and c), the TED-HCS exhibits an interconnected structure with a similar size distribution as that of the CoP@TED-HCS precursor, which is mainly attributed to the etching of the internal CoP self-sacrificing template after 24 h by using HNO3. Furthermore, the TED-HCS exhibits a homogeneous morphology with no significant shrinkage and fragmentation, indicating that the excellent structural stability of the outer carbon shell prepared from PPy can effectively resist external agitation and internal shrinkage stresses during the etching process. In order to investigate the outer carbon shell, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is employed, as shown in Fig. 2(d–f). From the HAADF-STEM image of the CoP@TED-HCS, a clearly core–shell structure can be easily obtained. Moreover, the thickness of carbon shell is ~ 10 nm. This uniformly coating layer and the hollow shell structure can also be found in the TED-HCS sample by the following high-temperature carbonization and etching treatment, as shown in Fig. 2(e). This three-dimensional connected hollow shell structure can fully contact with the electrolyte during the electrochemical reaction and provide more active sites, which is beneficial to the K+ storage and transport, and thus enhance the cycling and rate performance. Owing to the tri-elements (N, P, and O) doping, the carbon interlayer can be enlarged to 0.37 nm (Fig. 2f), compared with that of graphite (0.334 nm) [7]. In addition, the tri-elements (N, P, and O) doping can introduce abundant defects, as shown in Fig. S2. From the HAADF-STEM image of TED-HCS and corresponding three elemental mappings (Fig. 2g–k), it can be easily found that C, N, P, and O are indicated in orange, red, green, and yellow, respectively. During the high-temperature synchronous carbonization process, the inner CoP particle can be decomposed and the P atoms produced by the decomposition is further doped into the outer carbon. The hollow shell structure can still be maintained after further etching treatment, in which the P, N, and O elements are uniformly distributed without obvious clustering phenomenon, indicating that the TED-HCS samples with hollow and cross-linked structure are successfully prepared via a polymerization-calcination-etching method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CoP@TED-HCS and TED-HCS samples are shown in Fig. S3 and Fig. 3 (a), respectively. After carbonization at 800 °C, the CoP@TED-HCS sample shows not only two typical carbon characteristic peaks of (002) and (101), but also several sharp characteristic peaks located at 23.7°, 31.6°, 32.0°, 35.5°, 36.3°, 46.2°, 48.1°, 52.3°, and 56.0°. By comparison with the standard PDF card of CoP, these characteristic peaks perfectly match the crystal shape of the CoP, confirming that the well-crystallized CoP coated with tri-elements doped carbon is successful prepared. The XRD pattern of TED-HCS materials after HNO3 etching is shown in Fig. 3(a). In a comparison of the CoP@TED-HCS, the characteristic peaks of the CoP are completely disappeared in the TED-HCS. In other words, only two characteristic peaks of the carbon material can still be found, indicating that CoP particles are completely etched by HNO3. In addition, these (002) and (100) peaks from the XRD diffraction pattern are broadened, implying that the carbon structure in the TED-HCS sample shows a long-range disorder and short-range order [26]. Obviously, the angles of these (002) and (100) peaks in the TED-HCS sample are significantly shifted to the low angle compared with that of in the graphite. The JCPDS Card of graphite is 65–6212. From that, it can be easily obtained that the interlayer distance of the carbon material in the TED-HCS sample is enlarged [27]. Furthermore, the distance of the interlayer of the (002) and (101) peak for the TED-HCS sample can be calculated to 3.651 and 2.153 Å via Bragg’s equation, respectively. This result is consistent with the above TEM analysis. The extended distance between the carbon layers and the amorphous structure in the TED-HCS sample can effectively enhance the K+ storage and diffusion and thus improve the cycling and high-rate performance. The Raman spectra of the TED-HCS are displayed in Fig. S4(a). Two obvious characteristic peaks appeared at ~ 1590 cm−1 (G-peak) and ~ 1350–1 (D-peak) can be seen. Additionally, the I D/I G, which represents the degree of D- and G-peaks, is employed in assessing the level of disorder [28]. The I D/I G of 1.01 of the TED-HCS material can be easily obtained. The tri-elements (N, P, and O) doping can effectively introduce abundant active sites as well as enlarge the layer spacing of TED-HCS, boost the K+ storage and diffusion and, therefore, enhance the specific capacity and ultra-high performance [29]. N2 adsorption–desorption instrument is used to analyze the porosity information and specific surface area of TED-HCS. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the pore volume of 0.27 cm3 g−1 and specific surface area of 150.6 m2 g−1 of TED-HCS are obtained. Based on our previous work, high specific surface area can offer more closely contact between TED-HCS electrode and electrolyte to effectively boost rate property [13]. The insert in Fig. 3(b) displays the pore information of TED-HCS materials. From that, the pore size distributions (1.0–160 nm) can be seen, proving that hierarchical porous is co-existed in TED-HCS. This unique structure can provide huge reaction sites to boost K+ storage and enhance K+ transfer and thus obtain excellent rate performance. Besides, it can also ameliorate the huge volume changes during the long cycling process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is performed to investigate the chemical state and elemental composition of the TED-HCS. The full spectrum of the XPS analysis of TED-HCS is shown in Fig. S4(b), from which we can clearly see that the TED-HCS samples are composited of C (74.58 at.%), P (1.16 at.%), O (18.20 at.%), and N (6.05 at.%) elements. The doping content of the three elements is controlled by the carbonization temperature. The P content in the TED-HCS processed at 1000 °C is higher than that in the TED-HCS processed at 600 and 800 °C (Fig. S5). The peak located at 132.8 eV is the high-resolution XPS spectra of P 2p, which is originated from the decomposition of the inner CoP particle during the high-temperature carbonization process. The high-resolution XPS spectra of C 1 s in TED-HCS is shown in Fig. 3(c), which can be further fitted by four characteristic peaks of C = C–C (284.8 eV), C–P (285.2 eV), C–N/C–O (286.1 eV), and C(=O)–O (288.0 eV) [30,31]. The relevant characteristic peaks of C–P, C–O, and C–N are all shown in the C 1 s, confirming that N, O, and P elements have been successfully doped into the TED-HCS substrate. In Fig. 3(d), the N 1 s peak can be fitted by pyridine-N (398.4 eV), pyrrole-N (399.8 eV), and graphite-N (401.2 eV), respectively [32]. Pyridine-N and pyrrole-N exhibit highly electrochemically active and thus can effectively enhance the pseudocapacitance contribution. In addition, the graphite-N can enhance the conductivity of the whole electrode. In Fig. 3(e), two peaks appeared at 133.4 and 135.1 eV can be seen in the P 2p peak of TED-HCS, which is related to the P–C and P–O, respectively, which effectively confirms that the P atoms can be rivets on the carbon substrate by a solid chemical bond [33]. Meanwhile, the absence of P–Co bond here further indicates that the CoP is completely etched away by HNO3. Compared with single atom doping, tri-elements doping can boost the conductivity of carbon-based electrode effectively. Additionally, the P atom with a larger atomic radius can effectively enlarge the carbon interlayer and allows rapid entry of K+. The enlarged carbon layer can alleviate the volume change during the potassiation/depotassiation process [34]. The unique 3D hollow and cross-linked structure can be fully infiltrated with the electrolyte and offer fast electron and K-ion migration channels, thus contributing to the improvement of the electrochemical performance. The N, P, and O tri-elements doping can significantly enlarge the carbon interlayer and provides more active sites, making the TED-HCS anode display excellent reversible capacity, outstanding rate property, and superior cycling lifespan. The electrochemical performance of the TED-HCS electrode is shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4(a) displays the CV curves of the TED-HCS anode. A wide peak appeared ~ 0.4 V on the initial lap and disappeared during the following scan can be observed during the cathode scan. This irreversible phenomenon is ascribed to the irreversible reaction between the TED-HCS and K+-ion electrolyte during the initial lap and the production of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film [35]. In addition, a pair of peaks located at 0.01 and 0.45 V is connected with the K+ intercalation and deintercalation [21]. Importantly, the curve of the TED-HCS electrode at the second cycle almost coincides with the following laps, meaning that the TED-HCS electrode exhibits well-cycling stability. Fig. 4(b) shows the first three laps of the TED-HCS electrode at 100 mA g−1, and these charge/discharge shapes are similar with the above CV analysis. In addition, the capacity of TED-HCS anode at the first, second, and third cycles, is 798.5, 473.0, and 441.2 mAh g−1, respectively. In addition, the initial Coulomb efficiency (CE) of the TED-HCS is 47%, which is ascribed to the production of the SEI film between the TED-HCS and the electrolyte. Fig. 4(c) shows the rate performance of the TED-HCS electrode. The reversible specific capacity at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 A g−1 can reach 398, 361, 343, 286, and 247 mAh g−1, respectively. Besides, a high capacity of 212.5 mAh g−1 can be obtained at an ultra-high current density of 5.0 A g−1. More importantly, a reversible capacity of 325 mAh g−1 can be still maintained after 50 cycles when the current density returns to 0.1 A g−1. The rate performance of TED-HCS is higher than most carbon anode materials for PIB (Fig. S6). The hollow and solid interconnected structure in the TED-HCS electrode can offer abundant fast electron and K-ion migration channels as well as alleviate the huge volume changes during the discharge and charge process (Fig. S7 shows the contact angle test). Furthermore, it can be easily obtained from a four-probed method that the conductivity of the TED-HCS material is 2.1 S cm−1. Thus, the TED-HCS material can exhibit excellent rate performance, especially at ultra-high current density. Fig. 4(d) shows the cycling performance of the TED-HCS electrode at 200 mA g−1. The reversible capacity can reach 295.6 mAh g−1 with a ~ 100% CE after 100 cycles, exhibiting the structural stability of the TED-HCS electrode. The high reversible capacity of TED-HCS anode is attributed to the N, P, and O atoms doping, which can effectively enlarge the interlayer spacing to storage the intercalation of abundant K+, and increase the defects and active sites to absorb more K+. Furthermore, the TED-HCS anode exhibits excellent lifespan at 2.0 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 4(e), it still achieves a reversible capacity of 171 mAh g−1 with a CE of ~ 100% even after 2000 times cycling, which is better than most carbon-based anode materials for PIB (Table S1). Importantly, the TED-HCS anode can still maintain the original structure (Fig. S8). To investigate the K+ adsorption capability of three elements doping in the TEM-HCS, especially P-doping, density functional theory calculations are used. Five models of pure carbon and carbon with four elements doped structure (O-doped C, N-doped C, P-doped C, and N/P co-doped C) are shown in Fig. S9. After calculating, the K-adsorption energy of these five carbon materials is − 2.38 eV (Pure C), −2.57 eV (O-doped C), −3.01 eV (N-doped C), −3.33 eV (P-doped C), and − 3.27 eV, as shown in Fig. S10 and Fig. 5 (a), indicating that: (i) P doping in carbon materials is more effective for increasing capacity than N and O elements; (ii) there is a synergy between N and P elements, which can not only maintain a low adsorption energy, but also promote the dissociation of K+. From this point, using a simple and effective method to increase the doping amount of O, N, and P elements is very important for further enhancing the K+ storage electrochemical property of carbon electrode. The electrochemical behavior of TED-HCS electrode for PIBs is analyzed by the sweep CV testing at various scan rates from 0.2 to 10 mV s−1, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The reduction peak is gradually shifted to the higher voltage when the sweep speed enhances from 0.2 to 10.0 mV s−1, which is ascribed to the increasing polarization of the TED-HCS electrode [13,36]. Furthermore, the relationship between peak current (i) and scan rate (v) is i = av b [37], where a and b are adjustable constants, and the b-value of the carbon-based anode can reflect the K+ storage mechanism to a certain extent. The b-value closing to 1.0 and 0.5 represents the reaction process in the electrode is mainly dominated by the pseudocapacitance and Faraday reaction process, respectively [38]. In Fig. 5(c), the b-value of the TED-HCS electrode is calculated to be 0.93, indicating that the surface pseudocapacitance behavior mainly controls the K+ storage in the TED-HCS electrode. Furthermore, the contribution of pseudocapacitance and diffusion at a given scan rate is analyzed by the equation (1) [39]: (1) i = k 1 v + k 2 v 1 / 2 The k 1 v and k 2 v 1/2 are connected with the pseudocapacitance and Faraday reaction, respectively. After calculating, the contribution of pseudocapacitance increases significantly when the sweep speed increases from 0.2 to 10.0 mV s−1, as shown in Fig. 5(d). From that, we can obtain that the K+ storage capacity under ultra-high current density is mainly contribution to the whole specific capacity of TED-HCS, thus exhibiting excellent rate performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used to understand K+ storage behavior and structural stability of the TED-HCS electrode. Figs. S11 and S12 show the EIS curves of the TED-HCS electrode at the different cycles. Obviously, the TED-HCS electrode exhibits the lower charge-transfer resistance at three different voltages (1: discharge to 2.0 V; 2: discharge to 0.01 V; 3: return to 2.0 V) at the 10th cycle than that at the 100th cycle, respectively. This phenomenon is attributed to the structure stabilization process of TED-HCS electrode [22]. In addition, this is also related to the decrease of specific capacity during the 10th–100th cycles caused by the increase in impedance, as shown in Fig. 4(d). Moreover, based on EIS, the D K+ of TED-HCS can be analyzed. The TED-HCS electrode after calculating exhibits a similar D K+ under different cycles at the same voltage, especially at the 0.01 V (Fig. 5e and f), indicating that the TED-HCS electrode exhibits excellent structural stability. To deeply investigate the fast K+ migration rate, galvanostatic intermittent titration (GITT) of the TED-HCS electrode is employed [40]. Fig. 5(g) displays the potassiation and depotassiation process of the TED-HCS electrode. The testing time of discharge and charge at the current density of 50 mA g−1 is 20 min, and the relaxation time is 2 h. The D K+ of TED-HCS anode during the discharge (Fig. 5h) and charge (Fig. 5i) process are calculated, respectively. With the potassiation proceeding, the TED-HCS electrode shows a reduced D K+, but the D K+ is always maintaining between 10–10 to 10–12, indicating that the TED-HCS electrode exhibits fast K+ diffusion kinetic and excellent structural stability. This phenomenon can also be obtained in its depotassiation process, which is ascribed to the enlarged carbon interlayer, tri-elements doping, and cross-linked hollow structure. To show the commercial prospect of the TED-HCS materials, a PIHC (TED-HCS||AC) matched commercial AC cathode is assembled. Fig. S13 shows the electrochemical performance of AC in K-ion half-cell. In Fig. S13(a), AC cathode exhibits a double-layer capacitance K+ reaction mechanism [26]. To maximize the use of TED-HCS and AC, the mass of the AC is determined to 3.5 times to the mass of TED-HCS, because the TED-HCS and AC exhibit a capacity of 196.8 mAh g−1 (Fig. S14) and 56 mAh g−1 (Fig. S13b) after 100 cycles at 1.0 A g−1, respectively. Fig. 6 (a) displays the schematic illustration of TED-HCS||AC PIHC. During the charging process, abundant K+ cations/PF6 – anions move to the surface of TED-HCS anode/AC cathode. The reaction process is vice versa during the following discharge process. The TED-HCS||AC PIHC can make a yellow “star” lamp work after its assembling. In Fig. 6(b) (CV curves) and Fig. 6(c) (GDC curves), no apparent redox peak and charging/discharging platform can be respective seen in the TED-HCS||AC PIHC, suggesting that K-ion storage mechanism in this PIHC is dominated via the K+ adsorption storage, which is related to hierarchical porous and hollow structure [2]. As expected, the TED-HCS||AC PIHC exhibits excellent rate capability (Fig. 6d), which is strongly linked to the reaction kinetics between K+ and anode/cathode electrodes. A high specific capacity of 72 and 45 mAh g−1 can be obtained at the current density of 0.2 and 5.0 A g−1, respectively. Fig. 6(e and f) are the Ragone plots of the TED-HCS||AC PIHC. The TED-HCS||AC PIHC shows a great energy density of 215 Wh kg−1 under a power density of 210 W kg−1. More importantly, an ultrahigh energy density of 40.4 Wh kg−1 can be reached at 10500 W kg−1, which is higher than others related PIHC (Fig. 6e) and energy storage equipment (Fig. 6f) [4,6,8,20,26,41]. In addition, the TED-HCS||AC PIHC shows outstanding cycling performance. After 12,000 cycles, a high-capacity retention of 89.15% can be reached (Fig. 6g), confirming its potential application prospects with outstanding energy/power density and ultralong cycling performance. 4 Conclusions In summary, three-dimensional TED-HCS with cross-linked structure is successfully prepared via a polymerization-calcination-etching method, in which inner spherical CoP particles act as both a P source for element-doping during the calcination process and a self-sacrificial template during the final etching process. The TED-HCS anode shows an excellent reversible capacity and outstanding rate property as well as superior cycling stability. Meanwhile, the as-assembled TED-HCS||AC PIHC displays an excellent energy/power density (215 Wh kg−1/210 W kg−1, 40.4 Wh kg−1/10500 W kg−1) and maintains an ultrahigh capacity retention of 89.15% even cycling to 12,000 times. The outstanding performance of TED-HCS is ascribed to the following reasons: (i) tri-elements doping offers abundant reaction sites to achieve desirable reversible capacity and enlarge the carbon interlayer to ameliorate the huge volume changes and provide a fast transport space for K+ during the potassiation/depotassiation process; (ii) 3D cross-linked structure can provide excellent electrical conductivity, thus enhancing rate performance; (iii) hollow structure can fully contact with the electrolyte and provide more active sites for K+, thus ensuring a fast electrochemical response. The simple synthesis route and the “Killing Two Birds with One Stone” strategy shed an original insight into the quest for the preparation and further application (such as catalysis, hydrogen storage, and lithium-sulfur battery) of carbon-based materials with both multi-elements doping and specific morphology structure.

        "dc:description": "Integrating the merits of long lifespan and excellent energy as well as power densities, potassium-ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) exhibit great prospects for future energy storage devices. To boost comprehensive performance of PIHCs, heteroatom-doping and morphology-tuning as two comprehensive strategies have been devoted to designing uniquely structural carbon-based materials with favorable advantages. An ideal strategy for simultaneous atomic doping and structural regulation is expected to be developed. Herein, we propose a novel “Killing Two Birds with One Stone” strategy to prepare a tri-elements doped hollow carbon sphere (TED-HCS) as PIHCs anodes, that is, a single template of spherical CoP particles is rationally adopted, which not only provides both a P source for heteroatom-doping but also acts as a self-sacrificial template for hollow-structure engineering. The multifunctional TED-HCS presents a high capacity of 473.0 mAh g−1 and excellent rate performance of 212.5 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1. Remarkably, the as-assembled PIHCs show outstanding energy/power density (40.4 Wh kg−1/10500 W kg−1) and remain high-capacity retention of 89.15% even cycling 12,000 times. The “Killing Two Birds with One Stone” strategy offers new insight into the search for the preparation of carbon-based materials with multi-elements doping and specific morphology structure.",
