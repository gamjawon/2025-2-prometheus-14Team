Graphical abstract A MnNa2WO4/SiO2 catalyst was exposed to various gas compositions at high temperature in order to assess the effect of each poison on the catalyst. After these poisoning procedures, the catalysts were tested for their performances in the oxidative coupling of methane reaction. X-ray diffraction and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry were used to study and compare the catalyst before and after aging and these observations were used to understand the effect each poison had. It was found that exposure to hydrogen at 950 °C led to a significant reduction in activity and selectivity towards ethylene and ethane as well as significant changes in crystal phase structure and almost total loss of sodium loading. H2O and CO2 also appeared to have minor deactivating effects. Keywords OCM Ethylene Poison MnNa2WO4/SiO2 ICP-MS 1 Introduction Traditional methods for making complex organic molecules, such as pharmaceuticals and polymers, rely mainly on compounds found in crude oil. Since this is a finite resource, it is necessary to find an alternative way to produce hydrocarbons products. One solution to this problem would be to use the large reserves of methane-containing natural gas that exist around the world [1] or to use renewable methane sources, for example from anaerobic digestion. The oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) allows conversion of this underutilised resource into one of the world’s most important and widely used industrial feedstocks. If an economically viable OCM process could be designed, it would greatly reduce reliance on petroleum. Therefore, achieving this is currently one of the major challenges of heterogeneous catalysis. The OCM reaction has been studied heavily for several decades since its discovery in 1982 [2]. It is a partial oxidation with a complex reaction network. This reaction involves passing a mixture of methane and oxygen over a catalyst at high temperatures. It has been known for many years that OCM begins with the activation of methane by a surface based, homogeneous cleavage of a CH bond. This results in the formation of methyl radicals [3]. The following primary reactions leading to ethylene occur in the gas phase. However, secondary reactions leading to the combustion products may occur instead, on the surface or in the gas phase. Therefore, the complete reaction mechanism is highly complex and involves many different steps [4]. A simplified list of reactions is given in Eqs. (1)–(4). (1) 2 C H 4 + O 2 → C 2 H 4 + 2 H 2 O (2) 4 C H 4 + O 2 → 2 C 2 H 6 + 2 H 2 O (3) C H 4 + 2 O 2 → C O 2 + 2 H 2 O (4) 2 C H 4 + 3 O 2 → 2 C O + 4 H 2 O Since both initial activation and the competing secondary reactions involve the catalyst surface, a highly active catalyst is associated with low selectivity, limiting yield. A total C2+ yield of 30–35 % is expected to be required for the process to be economically viable [5]. Many different catalysts have been found to be active for the OCM reaction. These catalysts often face this trade-off between activity and selectivity. For example, as Alexiadis et al demonstrated [6], under their conditions, the MnNa2WO4/SiO2 catalyst to had 52.5 % C2+ selectivity but only 2.1 % methane conversion. In contrast, a Sr/La2O3 catalyst had 7 % methane conversion but just 23 % C2+ selectivity under the same conditions. These results correspond to C2+ yields of 1.1 % and 1.6 % respectively. Another highly studied OCM catalyst, Li/MgO, has been found to be unstable due to the volatilisation of lithium [7]. Additionally, different preparation methods have been investigated with the aim of increasing the performance of a catalyst [8]. The MnNa2WO4/SiO2 catalyst has attracted considerable interest as a candidate for OCM since its discovery by Fang et al [9] due to its very good selectivity. The catalyst has a complex structure including many different phases and therefore there has been debate as to the precise role of each metal and the nature of the active site. Wu et al claim that the primary site of methane activation is the distorted WO4 tetrahedron [10] and that this distortion is a result of interaction of Na2WO4 with the support. This distortion leads to a much higher selectivity. Elkins and Hagelin-Weaver also found that the Na2WO4 phase was important for selectivity [11]. They found that although Mn/SiO2 and Na2WO4/SiO2 had similar activities, the overall yield for Na2WO4/SiO2 was approximately five times higher due to a higher C2 selectivity. They also found that the MnNa2WO4/SiO2 catalyst was much more active than either Mn/SiO2 or Na2WO4/SiO2 indicating a synergistic effect between the Mn and Na2WO4 sites. Similar observations were also made by Jiang et al [12]. In contrast, Wang et al determined that the active site was formed by the interaction of manganese and gas phase oxygen [13]. They claim that the sodium is required to provide selectivity to the active site, preventing further oxidation of methyl radicals, and that the tungsten provides stability. In their hypothesis, the selective active site is an interaction of NaOMn. Takanabe et al studied the phase structure of Na2WO4 at high temperature under aa O2/H2O mixture as well as under OCM reaction conditions using in situ techniques [14]. They found evidence of the Na2WO4 existing in a molten state and formed a uniform layer over the support. Additionally, they found that the surface was richer in Na compared to W which was more present away from the surface of the Na2WO4 layer. They found that Na was present at the surface in the form of Na2O2 which catalysed the formation of hydroxyl radicals from H2O and O2, which go on to activate methane in the OCM reaction. Malekzadeh et al found that the presence of sodium lowered the temperature of the amorphous silica to cristobalite phase change from 1500 °C to 900 °C and the addition of Na2WO4 lowered it still further to 775 °C [15]. This is important as cristobalite is inert under OCM conditions compared with amorphous silica which is active but unselective. Additionally, they found that manganese doped on silica had no effect on the transition temperature. They found that the manganese species had moderate interactions with the Na2WO4 species as opposed to the extremes shown when manganese was replaced by other transition metals. This may explain the special role of manganese and allow spill over of activated oxygen from Mn to WO4. The effect of sodium on the silica phase transition was also reported by Palermo et al. [16]. They also determined that the manganese was responsible for improving the selectivity as a MnNa2WO4/SiO2 catalyst was found to have much higher selectivity than Na2WO4/SiO2. One of the aims of this work was to identify a catalyst suitable for use in a membrane reactor. Such a membrane would allow selective permeation of oxygen from air into the catalyst bed along the full length of the membrane. This provides three main advantages. The first is that it eliminates the need to use expensive pure oxygen, since air can be used instead with separation happening in situ. Secondly, the feed of oxygen is distributed throughout the bed, removing the hotspots found in co-feeding reactors, which favours OCM instead of combustion. Finally, the oxygen arrives in the catalyst bed as labile lattice oxygen which readily converts methane to methyl radicals but is not present in the gas phase, limiting gas phase combustion. These factors favour a better yield of ethane and ethylene [17]. The downside of oxygen selective membranes is that they require elevated temperatures to afford a significant oxygen permeation rate for example, Bhatia et al found that oxygen permeation through their oxygen selective membrane dropped with increasing temperature and did not begin to rise until above 750 °C [17]. Additionally, since OCM is a highly exothermic reaction, it is likely that maintaining good heat management in a full-scale reactor would be challenging and temperatures excursions are possible. In order to maintain economic feasibility, it is required that the catalyst does not deactivate rapidly at the high temperatures that may be expected in a reactor, especially at the higher end of the expected temperature range. The reason for the high temperatures used in this work was therefore to understand the impact of temperatures up to 950 °C on the catalyst performance. Catalyst performance is a critical parameter in commercial operation. It is not currently known how various common catalyst poisons might impact the performance of an OCM catalyst such as MnNa2WO4/SiO2. Any loss of yield from, for example, poisoning, would harm the viability of OCM as a process. Since the mechanism is so complex, it is difficult to make predictions of which gasses would be the strongest poisons based on other previous work in different reactors. It was decided to test a range of poison gasses common to other reactions and other catalyst. Sulphur-containing gasses such as H2S strong poisons for many catalysts and are common components in natural gas and other fuels; much work has gone into investigating the so-called sulphur tolerance of catalysts used for a variety of applications. For example, Pd/Al2O3 catalysts for combustion of methane, for example in ventilation gas from mines, is a topic of great interest due to the significantly greater global warming potential of methane than the major product, CO2. It was found by Mowery and McCormick [18] that introduction of SO2 into a methane and oxygen feed, particularly in the presence of water, could lead to significant deactivation of the catalyst through the formation of surface sulphate species. The activity could not be restored by removing SO2 from the feed. Yu and Shaw and Hoyos et al made similar observations with H2S and no water rather than SO2 and steam. Additionally, they found that treatment in H2 was able to regenerate much, though not all, of the catalyst’s activity [19,20]. H2S has been shown to poison other catalysts, for example, biomass gasification [21] or steam reforming catalysts [22]. In this case used for conversion of naphthalene, was found to suffered significantly from exposure to H2S. The nickel centres on the catalyst were found to convert to nickel sulphide. This required the use of a sulphur sorbent to remove H2S before it reaches the catalyst. Carbon dioxide is a product of OCM and has been proposed as an oxidant in place of oxygen by several groups [23,24]. It is another gas that has been shown to affect catalyst structure. Shi et al found that addition of CO2 into an OCM gas feed increased the ratio of Na2WO4:MnWO4 at the catalyst surface up to a CH4:O2:CO2 ratio of 3:1:2. This was found to coincide with an increase in methane conversion and C2 selectivity. As further CO2 was added, these trends were reversed with a lower Na2WO4:MnWO4 ratio and lower conversion and selectivity [25]. It is also important to consider the effect of hydrogen on the catalyst since we have observed hydrogen production under oxygen poor conditions. Hydrogen in particular could lead to the reduction of the various metal centres. Since the different metal centres are thought to undergo redox cycles during operation, this could impair the performance of the catalyst. The purpose of this paper is to report our work on the investigation of the effect of various gases upon the performance of the catalyst. These gases were selected as they are all common poisons under other catalytic systems and are likely to be present in a full scale OCM reactor. The work presented here involved aging a standard under different gas conditions, testing the performances of the aged catalysts and then analysing the effects of the gases on the catalyst structure to better understand the cause of any deactivation. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation All metal salts used in these preparations were bought from Sigma-Aldrich. The amorphous silica powder was supplied by Evonik Industries. The method for making MnNa2WO4/SiO2 was based on some of the incipient wetness impregnation methods published in the literature [26,27] although those methods vary. The catalyst was made by sequential impregnation of 1.6 wt% of manganese nitrate tetrahydrate and 5 wt% sodium tungstate dihydrate, in two steps, on to an amorphous silica support. The catalyst was dried at 105 °C overnight after each of these impregnations. After the second drying step, the catalyst was calcined at 750 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C per minute, dwelling for two hours. 2.2 Pre-aging Samples of the MnNa2WO4/SiO2 catalyst were heated for 48 h in flowing gas. The gas compositions were either 100 ppm H2S in N2 or one of H2O, CO2, H2 or O2, diluted to 20 % in N2. Two samples of catalyst were aged in each of these gas compositions, one at 820 °C and the other at 950 °C. These samples were cooled down under pure nitrogen. Another two samples were aged under the same conditions, one at each temperature, but under pure nitrogen. This was done to better differentiate between the effects on the catalyst of heating for long durations from the effects of each gas composition. 2.3 Catalyst testing Screening tests of pre-aged samples were conducted using an eight channel, packed-bed reactor. The gas composition had a methane to oxygen ratio of 8:1, 32.5 % N2 dilution and a space velocity of 54 LCH4gcat −1 h−1. Tests focused on the performance at 850 °C although significant dwell time at 750 °C and 800 °C was included as well. For these tests, each 4 mm quartz tube was filled with 40 mg of catalyst and 200 mg of inert SiC, again, in the size range 250 μm–355 μm. Results were measured with a Varian CP-4900 micro GC and normalised against N2, used as an internal standard. Methane conversion, selectivity, ethylene:ethane ratio and other parameters were studied for changes over that period. Each test of aged samples contained reference samples of fresh catalyst to compare against. Each aged sample was tested multiple times and average results are reported as the results were consistent with each other. 2.4 Characterisation X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected a Bruker AXS D8 diffractometer (Johnson Matthey, Sonning Common, UK) with Cu Kα radiation over a range of 2θ = 10–130° with a 0.023° step size. Phase identification was conducted using Bruker-AXS Diffrac Eva V4.2 Inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP) was also carried out. Samples were first digested by a lithium metaborate fusion at 1050 °C for 10 min, to melt the flux / sample mixture. The samples were then dissolved in nitric acid before being diluted and doped with 5 ppm yttrium as an internal standard. Solutions were final run on a Spectro ICP against suitable calibration standards covering the concentration ranges expected. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalytic performance results The various aged samples were tested and compared to the fresh catalyst, tested under identical conditions. Methane conversion and C2 selectivity data at 850 °C are presented in Table 1 . The data at 850 °C was chosen since this temperature gives much higher conversions than lower temperatures as can be seen in Fig. 1 , allowing for easier comparison to determine whether deactivation has occurred, additionally, this is more representative of the temperatures that would be use in the membrane reactor design upon which this work was based. The effect of heat during deactivation can be understood by comparing the performance of the fresh sample with the sample aged under inert nitrogen. While the fresh sample had an average methane conversion of 9.0 ± 1.0 % under the tested conditions, the conversion for the nitrogen aged sample fell outside this range at both temperatures with conversions of 7.1 ± 0.1 % and 5.8 ± 0.2 % after aging at 820 °C and 950 °C respectively. This clearly demonstrates that heating the sample to such high temperatures for 48 h had negative effects on performance, independent of the gas composition. In all cases, the samples aged at 950 °C suffered a greater loss of methane conversion than those catalyst aged under the same gasses at 820 °C. This agrees with the observations made earlier that higher temperatures give an increased rate of deactivation. C2 selectivity was unaffected by thermal treatment under nitrogen. Without considering the effect of different gases, heat alone could have a number of different effects on the catalyst which could explain this deactivation. One such possible effect could be a change in the phase structure of the catalyst. This will be examined further in Section 3.2. Furthermore, heat treatment could cause sintering of metal centres on the catalyst surface. This would lower the active surface area of metal which could participate in the reaction, lowing activity, without impacting selectivity. The different aging gasses can be compared against one another to determine the effect of each, independent of the effect of temperature. For this, the sample aged under pure nitrogen is used as the reference rather than the fresh sample. This is because the N2 aged sample has experienced the same thermal effects as the other aged samples and therefore any differences can be regarded as purely coming from the gas composition. There appears to be no deactivating effect from H2S as the methane conversion results are very similar to those obtained for the pure N2 sample. This is unusual as H2S is typically a very strong poison for a range of heterogeneous catalysts. Since H2S typically poisons catalysts by adsorbing to their surfaces, and ICP data showed no additional sulphur adsorbed to the sample, this provides strong evidence that such an interaction, if it occurs at all, is too weak to affect the catalyst after ex situ aging. Oxygen also appears to have had little effect on the performance, having similar results to the pure nitrogen aged sample. The methane conversion of the oxygen aged sample after aging at 820 °C is actually significantly higher than the corresponding nitrogen-aged sample with no overlap of their error bars. The catalyst is operated under oxidising conditions, so it is not surprising that oxygen has no effect. In contrast, the presence of steam or CO2 had much more noticeable results on the catalyst. The methane conversion for the samples aged at 820 °C is 7.1 ± 0.1% for pure nitrogen but only 5.7 ± 0.1% for steam and 5.4 ± 0.3% for CO2. It remains unclear what effect these poisons may be having on the catalyst although they may be aiding sintering of the metal centres. Takanabe et al showed that in the presence of steam, a Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst was capable of forming hydroxyl radicals, which seemed to play a role in the OCM reaction [14]. It is unclear whether the formation of hydroxyl radicals could have influenced stability, however. Hydrogen is another gas that seems to have a significant impact on performance. In Table 1, the samples aged under hydrogen, at both temperatures, show a noticeably greater loss of methane conversion than for the equivalent nitrogen-aged samples. In addition, at 950 °C, hydrogen has a substantial impact on selectivity which has not been seen previously for any of the other aging tests. The selectivity of the catalyst aged at 950 °C under hydrogen shows a C2 selectivity of only 22 ± 0.2% compared with 52 ± 0.7% for the corresponding sample aged under inert nitrogen and 52 ± 0.7% for the fresh catalyst. 3.2 X-ray diffraction XRD was used to determine the effect on the phase structure of the catalyst before and after pre-aging with the aim to infer the mechanism of deactivation. The XRD results can only show the phases present in the catalyst at room temperature before and after poisoning, not the phases present under high-temperature OCM conditions. For example, Yu et al demonstrated that Na2WO4 is present in a molten state at 780 °C under OCM conditions. This no doubt has implications for understanding the results of the XRD measurements. This fact should be borne in mind when interpreting the results [28]. The fresh catalyst and the samples aged under N2, CO2, H2O and H2 at 950 °C were selected. Fresh catalyst and the N2 aged sample were selected in order to study the effect of temperature in the absence of reactive gases. Additionally, CO2, H2O and H2 all caused additional deactivation, so these were selected for study to be compared with the sample aged under N2. The results are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2 . Comparing the fresh and N2 aged sample, it can be seen that thermal treatment led to several phase changes. In the fresh catalyst, the metal dopants are present as three phases: Na2WO4, MnWO4 and Mn7O8SiO2. In other previous work, Mn2O3 was seen as a major phase [12,29], though it was not observed here. After heating in nitrogen, Na2WO4 remains, although with a smaller peak, and the two manganese-containing phases disappear, being replaced by MnO2. Additionally, there is a phase change in the silica with some cristobalite changing to form another phase, tridymite. The same phase changes occur under CO2 and steam indicating that the additional loss of activity experienced after aging in those gases is not related to a change in the phases present. The sample aged under H2 shows more differences compared with the N2 aged sample. Na2WO4 has disappeared during aging under H2 with tungsten metal being present instead. Additionally, there are two different manganese containing phases that are present or potentially present instead of MnO2. Both of these phases are in oxidation states lower than the +4 of Mn in MnO2. These results indicate that aging under hydrogen was sufficient to cause a reduction of the metal-containing phases on the catalyst. This could explain the loss of activity and selectivity, as the phases required for an active and highly selective OCM reaction may not be able to reform under reaction conditions. It is worth noting that no sodium containing phases are visible for the sample aged under hydrogen, adding further support to the idea that sodium is responsible for high selectivity. 3.3 Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP) data was collected for the same samples analysed by XRD. The aim of this was to determine whether any metal loss occurred during pre-aging. The data, shown in Fig. 3 , demonstrates that the percentage of the various metal dopants does not change significantly for any of the aged samples with the exception of sodium. The sample aged under hydrogen contains only 0.05 % sodium compared with around 1% for all of the other samples. Wang et al suggested that sodium ensures the high selectivity of the active sites and this would certainly explain the significant drop in selectivity that occurs upon loss of sodium [13]. The loss of sodium is most likely a consequence of the reduction of Na2WO4 species in the presence of hydrogen, to metallic sodium and tungsten. The boiling point of sodium metal is approximately 885 °C as shown by Zhang et al. [30,31], which would imply that sodium metal formed by reduction is lost through volatilisation. This would partially explain why the loss of selectivity is seen after reduction at 950 °C but not at 820 °C in the presence of hydrogen. When gases other than hydrogen are used, the Na2WO4 phase is not reduced thereby preventing volatilisation of sodium. Gordienko et al found evidence that the MnNa2WO4/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced in presence of hydrogen or methane and subsequently fully reoxidised [32]. However, in their work, the maximum temperature used was 850 °C, below the boiling point of sodium, and a relatively short amount of time was spent at this temperature. Parishan et al also used a chemical looping technique to increase the selectivity of the MnNa2WO4/SiO2 catalyst under OCM conditions demonstrating that the catalyst can cope with reducing conditions for short periods [33]. In contrast to these observations, reoxidation of the catalyst would not lead to reactivation of the catalyst in this case since the sodium has already been lost, most likely due to the higher temperatures and longer durations used. Takanabe et al showed that there is a high presence of sodium at the surface of a Na2WO4/SiO2 under OCM reaction conditions in the form of Na2O2 [14] and they suggested that this may be the active site. If this is the case in this catalyst, then this would further support the explanation that reduction of sodium containing phases under hydrogen and subsequent volatilisation is responsible for the loss of selectivity. There appears to be no significant change in the concentration of any of the metals in any other sample, including those aged under CO2 and H2O which demonstrated greater deactivation compared with the sample aged under N2. Therefore, the routes of deactivation which occur in those instances must be different, for example, sintering. 4 Conclusion Exposure at high temperature to steam, CO2 and hydrogen can have a negative impact on the performance of the MnNa2WO4/SiO2 catalyst. The former two of these lead to losses of methane conversion in excess of the amount that could be attributed to thermal effects alone. This could not be explained by phase change or metal loss, which leaves sintering as the only plausible deactivation mechanism. Hydrogen appears to have no impact on performance when the aging was conducted at 820 °C but has a major effect at 950 °C; this includes a major loss of C2 selectivity, something not seen with other gases. Deactivation under hydrogen at 950 °C is caused by extensive phase changes which occur under those conditions leading to the loss of active phases and the volatilisation of sodium. Steam and CO2 are of particular concern as they are all products of the OCM reaction and they are also commonly used as inlet inert gases and therefore, unlike H2S, cannot simply be removed from the reactor feed using sorbents. H2S appears to not pose a problem as it does not interact significantly with the catalyst at the temperatures used. Therefore, in an industrial OCM process, temperatures as high as 950 °C should be avoided when using MnNa2WO4/SiO2, particularly in reducing atmospheres, as it can lead to deactivation of the catalyst. Good heat management will be required to maintain a temperature of around 850 °C, at which the catalyst is stable.

After these poisoning procedures, the catalysts were tested for their performances in the oxidative coupling of methane reaction. X-ray diffraction and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry were used to study and compare the catalyst before and after aging and these observations were used to understand the effect each poison had. It was found that exposure to hydrogen at 950 °C led to a significant reduction in activity and selectivity towards ethylene and ethane as well as significant changes in crystal phase structure and almost total loss of sodium loading. H2O and CO2 also appeared to have minor deactivating effects.",
