Graphical abstract Dawson-type POMs series of formula α- and β-K6P2W18O62 isomers, α1- and α2-K6P2Mo5W13O62 isomers, α-K6P2Mo6W12O62 isomer and α1-K7P2Mo5VW12O62 isomer, have been used as catalysts for the liquid phase oxidation of cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone mixture to form adipic acid in presence of hydrogen peroxide without solvent, without phase-transfer agents and without adding acid. 31P NMR spectroscopy of different POMs after cyclohexanol oxidation showed the formation of new active species that can be attributed to “peroxo-POMox” form. An adipic acid yield of 69% was obtained from the oxidation of a mixture of cyclohexanol (50%) and cyclohexanone (50%) with α-K6P2Mo6W12O62 isomer. Keywords Dawson-type polyoxometalates Cyclohexanone Cyclohexanol Hydrogen peroxide Adipic acid 1 Introduction The substrate liquid-phase oxidation in presence of the transition metal based catalysts with a clean oxidant as hydrogen peroxide, can be an environmentally friendly alternative to that using inorganic oxidants as HNO3 and HClO4. Contrarily, to the reduction of conventional acids that lead to pollutant gas causing serious environmental problems, that of hydrogen peroxide leads only to water. Moreover, in the oxidation mechanisms with hydrogen peroxide, it was suggested that H2O2 can be involved in the peroxometal formation (metal coming from the catalyst) that is expected to give stoechiometrically oxygen atoms to the substrate [1] and on the other hand, it was observed that peroxometal active oxidant species are favored when the metal of catalyst, in its highest oxidation state, is both a Lewis acid and a weak oxidant, as transition metal ions with d0 or d1 electronic configurations (Mo(VI), W(VI), V(V), Nb(V)) [2]. Keggin-type polyoxometalates (POMs) contain both redox centers and Lewis acid sites (Mo(VI), W(VI) and V(V)) and were reported as efficient catalysts for liquid phase oxidation [3]. The advantages of this type of compounds are their great stability towards oxygen donors and the possibility of the incorporation of several transition metals [4]. Although, Keggin-type POMs (PM12 with M: Mo(VI), W(VI)) are the most studied, Dawson-type POMs (P2M18), that have not received much attention as catalysts, may be interesting candidates to catalyze oxidation reactions, because the number of elements with a high oxidation state is greater than that corresponding to the Keggin anion (18 against 12). In this context, this work was focalisated in the application of Dawson-type POMs as catalysts for adipic acid synthesis from liquid-phase oxidation of cyclohexanol and/or cyclohexanone in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Adipic acid (AA), main precursor for nylon 6,6, is considered as a valuable raw material for industry. It is prepared, in industrial process, by oxidizing of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone, so-called ketone/alcohol oil (KA oil), coming from cyclohexane or benzene, using nitric acid as oxidant, whose major disadvantage is the release of the nitrogen oxide (N2O), source of greenhouse effect and ozone depletion [5,6]. The use of hydrogen peroxide as oxidant for the AA synthesis in the presence of tungsten based catalysts was the subject of many works [7–12]. For increase oxidation reaction rates, ionic liquid catalysts composed of tungstate based species and sulfonic, sulphamic or p-toluene sulfonic acid groups [7–9], surfactant-type catalysts (STC) as phase-transfer agents [10], and conventional acids (H2SO4, H3PO4) [11,12] were used. These additives are harmful to the environment. Several studies have examined the adipic acid synthesis from cyclohexanone oxidation, in the presence of molecular oxygen or peroxide hydrogen. It was reported that the cyclohexanone oxidation by molecular oxygen over H3+ x PMo12− x V x O40 (x =1 and 2) catalyst, in acetic acid medium, led to a strong increase of the conversion compared to that obtained in the presence of water only [13]. The authors have suggested that the addition of the acetic acid promotes a radical autoxidation mechanism while an aqueous medium that of a redox mechanism. With Mn(OAc)2/Co(OAc)2 [14] and μ3-oxo-bridged Co/Mn cluster complexes systems [15], high catalytic activity and high AA selectivity were also observed in acetic acid medium for cyclohexanone oxidation with molecular oxygen. The positive effect, exerted by acetic acid to stabilize and prevent the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, was demonstrated. With hydrogen peroxide as oxidant for cyclohexanone oxidation to adipic acid, it was shown that tetrabutylammonium salts of both H3PW12O40 and H3PMo12O40, react catalytically in the presence of H2O2; whereas, they react only stoichiometrically in its absence [16]. Keggin-type transition metal-substituted phosphomolybdic as M x PMo12O40 (M: Ni, Co, Fe) [17], H3−2x Co x PMo12O40 [18], H3−2x Ni x PMo12O40 and (NH4)3−2x Ni x PMo12O40 (x: 0.0–1.5) [19] are found to be efficient for adipic acid synthesis, from liquid-phase oxidation of cyclohexanol and/or cyclohexanone in the presence of hydrogen peroxide without solvent, without phase-transfer agents and without adding acid because, the acidity necessary to the hydrogen peroxide reduction as well as the oxidizing power needed for the oxidation reaction could come from the POM only. In these works, it was shown that the molybdenum based POMS, are easily reducible to give blue compounds without modifying their structures. This allows to follow the reaction evolution. Cobalt based salts generally present a higher activity than nickel based salts. Furthermore, it was observed that the cyclohexanol addition to cyclohexanone caused a decrease of adipic acid yield [15,17–19]. In our previous works, we also showed that Dawson-type POMs, K6P2Mo x W18− x O62 (x =0, 5, 6) and α1 and α2 isomer compounds were found to be active in methanol oxidation at 260°C in the presence of molecular oxygen and the product distribution (formaldehyde, methyl formate, dimethylether, dimethoxymethane) depends on the polyanion composition and on the framework symmetry [20]. In this work, Dawson type POMs as α- and β-K6P2W18O62 isomers, α1- and α2-K6P2Mo5W13O62 isomers, α-K6P2Mo6W12O62 isomer and α1-K7P2Mo5VW12O62 isomer, have been used as catalysts for the liquid phase oxidation of cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone mixture to form adipic acid in presence of hydrogen peroxide and free solvent. The physico-chemical characterizations (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)), 31P NMR spectroscopy, UV–vis spectroscopy and thermal analysis (TGA and TDA) of these POMs were published previously [20]. 2 Experimental 2.1 POMs preparation α and β isomers of K6P2W18O62 were prepared according to the literature data [21]. Mixed W/Mo/V polyoxometalates α-K6P2Mo6W12O62 isomer, α1- and α2-K6P2Mo5W13O62 and α1-K7P2Mo5VW12O62 isomer, were obtained from the hexavacant anion [H2P2W12O56]12− according to the method described by Contant et al., including the successive condensation and hydrolysis [22]. The different POMs were noted: α-P2W18, β-P2W18, α1-P2Mo5W13, α2-P2Mo5W13, α-P2Mo6W12 and α1-P2Mo5VW12. Fig. 1 summarizes the different steps of the preparation of substituted POMs from α-P2W18. 2.2 Catalytic test The synthesis method is based on that described in the literature [16]. The liquid-phase oxidation of cyclohexanol (-ol) or mixture of cyclohexanol (-ol) and cyclohexanone (-one) was carried out at 90°C, using a 100mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser. The reaction mixture is constituted by a calculated amount of catalyst and substrate, where into one drop of hydrogen peroxide (30%) was added whenever the catalyst showed a color change from yellow or light green to blue, characteristic color of reduced molybdenum based POMs. The reaction mixture was stirred at 800rpm. The catalytic cycle is finished when the POM catalyst is no longer reduced, indicating that the substrate was completely consumed. The reaction time was found to be of 20h. Hydrogen peroxide (30% solution in water) concentration was verified by potassium permanganate method prior to use. It is noteworthy that beyond 90°C, hydrogen peroxide may be decomposed. The resultant homogeneous mixture was cooled at 4°C overnight. Adipic acid, one of the oxidation products, was isolated as crystals and identified by FT-IR spectroscopy and melting point (152°C). The AA yield (%) is: AA mass formed×100/theoretical AA mass. 2.3 13P NMR characterization 31P MAS NMR spectra were measured at room temperature on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer. 85% H3PO4 was used as an external reference. 3 Results and discussion The catalytic properties of α-P2W18, β-P2W18, α1-P2Mo5W13, α2-P2Mo5W13, α-P2Mo6W12 and α1-P2Mo5VW12 were examined in the liquid-phase oxidation, of cyclohexanol (-ol) and mixture of the two reagents (-ol/-one) at different percentages (10–90%) in presence of hydrogen peroxide (30%) and free solvent. It was shown that the reaction did not take place when the initial mixture is composed simultaneously of catalyst, H2O2 and substrate (-ol or -one). The importance of gradual addition of H2O2 after each reduction of the catalyst by the substrate is confirmed by preliminary tests. The oxidation reaction leads to the formation of adipic, glutaric and succinic acids. In the present work, only adipic acid formation was taken into account, it is isolated from the other products by cold crystallization. The adipic acid purity was verified by the melting point measurement (152°C) and the record of its IR spectrum. Fig. 2 shows the polyhedral representation of the Dawson polyanion structure, [P2M18O62]6− and numbering of the metallic atoms according to IUPAC recommendations. In Dawson heteropolyanions, two different types of clusters are present: two terminal trimetallic groups M3O13 (numbers 1–3 and 16–18) and six dimetallic groups M2O10 (numbers 4 to 15) arranged in a double crown. The overall framework having a D3h symmetry corresponds to α isomer. M3O13 and M2O10 clusters are connected to each other only by single μ-oxo-bridges and the local symmetry of all W(VI), Mo(VI) and V(V) is octahedral. Based on the results of tungsten, vanadium and phosphorus NMR spectroscopy, Contant et al. [22] assigned and marked the positions of molybdenum and vanadium atoms in the mixed W/Mo/V Dawson heteropolyanions as follows: 1,4,9,10,15,16-P2Mo6W12 (α-P2Mo6W12), 1,9,10,15,16-P2Mo5W13 (α1-P2Mo5W13), 4,9,10,15,16-P2Mo5W13; (α2-P2Mo5W13), and 1,9,10,15,16-4-P2Mo5VW12 (α1-P2Mo5VW12). 3.1 Cyclohexanol oxidation Different preliminary tests, carried out with P2W12Mo6 showed that the AA formation requires the existence of both -ol substrate and catalyst. Hydrogen peroxide must be added progressively by fraction after every catalyst reduction by the substrate. AA is not observed in the absence of catalyst or hydrogen peroxide. The catalyst reduction is manifested by the appearance of the blue color characterizing Mo(V) in POM. Thereafter, the H2O2 injection leads to POM oxidation that comes back to its yellow initial color characterizing Mo(VI) in POM, as in free catalyst. The substrate oxidation lasted 20h after starting the addition of H2O2. In order to optimize the reaction conditions, the effect of catalyst mass (0.032–0.250g) on the adipic acid yield, was examined with P2W12Mo6 catalyst with a rate agitation of 400rpm. The results are reported in Table 1 . An increase of the catalyst mass from 0.032 to 0.250g led to an increase of the AA yield from 16 to 59%. It should be noted that when the catalyst mass increases from 0.125 to 0.250g, the difference in the AA yields is of 3% only, while when a catalyst mass increase from 0.063 to 0.125g, AA yield increases by a factor greater than 2 (from 26 to 56%). These results may suggest that 15mmol of substrate are not enough to reduce 0.250g of POM catalyst. As 0.125 and 0.250g lead to similar AA yields (56–59%), the catalyst mass was fixed at 0.125g corresponding to 7.4×10−5 mol. In earlier work, it was shown that the maximum AA yield is achieved with a high stirring rate (800rpm) [17–19] and many researches also recommend the use of vigorous stirring rate of the reaction mixture [15,23,24]. With a catalyst mass of 0.125g, it was observed that an increase of stirring rate from 400 to 800rpm led to an AA yield increase from 56 to 59%, value close to that obtained with a catalyst mass of 0.250g. This result confirms the reported observations in the literature. Table 2 shows the catalytic performances of different POMs in the cyclohexanol oxidation with H2O2. α- and β-P2W18 isomers have similar catalytic behavior (5 and 6% of AA yield, respectively) that seems to be independent of the Dawson anion symmetry. The substitution of W atoms by Mo atoms led to a strong increase of the AA yield with 35, 45 and 59% in the presence of α1-P2W13Mo5, α2-P2W13Mo5 and α-P2W12Mo6, respectively. The introduction of molybdenum in Dawson unit indicates a strong increase of the oxidative power of the catalyst and this latter increases with Mo atom number. The strong oxidative character of P2W12Mo6 compared to that of P2W13Mo5 was already observed for the methanol oxidation [20]. Contrary to P2W18, in the case of P2W13Mo5, the AA production is sensitive to position of Mo metal in the framework. It is favored when the Mo atoms are in the double crown (4, 9, 10 and 15 position) and in the terminal trimetallic group (1 or 16 position), with 45% against 35% of AA yield in the presence of α2-P2W13Mo5 and α1-P2W13Mo5, respectively. In P/W/Mo/V system (α1-P2Mo5VW12), the substitution of one Mo atom situated in position “4” by a V atom in α-P2W12Mo6 led to an AA yield decrease from 59 to 11%. These results seem to indicate that a strong oxidative character of the catalyst is not favored to AA formation but probably it is in favor to that of the other carboxylic acids. Another hypothesis could be the decomposition of H2O2 to O2 and H2O by the vanadium, similar to Fenton mechanism [25]. The oxidative power introduced by Mo and V atoms has already been observed in the case of both Keggin and Dawson type heteropolyanions [26,27]. The redox sites were attributed to the metal–terminal oxygen bond (MOd). From these results, P2W12Mo6 displays as the most efficient catalyst for cyclohexanol oxidation with 59% of AA yield. Its efficacy has already been observed for methanol oxidation [20]. 3.2 Cyclohexanone–cyclohexanol mixture oxidation The nitric acid based industrial process for AA production proceeds by oxidation of a mixture of cyclohexanol (50%) and cyclohexanone (50%) [28–30]. It seemed interesting to examine the influence of the (-one) addition (10–90%) to the (-ol) on AA yield. In this study, the reaction was conducted with the most active catalyst, P2W12Mo6 (cat/substrate molar ratio: 4.93×10−3). The catalytic results (Fig. 3 ) show that the obtained AA yields from -ol oxidation and from -one oxidation are very similar (59% and 58%, respectively). Similar AA yields equal to 46–51%, 48–51%, 52–51%, 42–41% were also obtained for the composition of reaction mixture corresponding to -ol/-one ratio of 60/40 or 40/60, of 70/30 or 30/70, of 80/20 or 20/80 and of 90/10 or 10/90, respectively. It should be emphasized that 50% of -ol and 50% of -one composition, corresponding to industrial process (KA oil) exhibits the best performance with 69% of AA yield. This similarity for AA yields might suggest that alcohol oxidation directly give the AA acid without going through the ketone oxidation as would be expected. Oxidation of the two substrates would be on different catalytic sites. The simultaneous presence of alcohol (10–90%) and ketone (90–10%) mixtures inhibit the oxidation of each of the reagents except for the -ol (50%)/-one (50%) mixture. These results differ from those obtained with Keggin-type POMs, where, it was observed that the yields obtained from the alcohol are much lower than those derived from the ketone oxidation indicating that the following steps take place: -ol→-one→AA [17–19]. Table 3 and Fig. 4 present the results of 31P NMR spectroscopy of different POMs before and after cyclohexanol oxidation. In the case P/W systems, chemical shifts after reaction showed two characteristic peaks of both isomers P2W18 (α- and β-) indicating that POM structure was conserved after reaction. For the P/W/Mo and P/W/Mo/V systems, the 31P NMR results show the appearance of a new chemical species presenting only one signal at −0.22 and −0.49ppm, respectively. Based on 31P NMR results, the appearance of a single peak seems to indicate that the environment of the two phosphorus atoms of P2W12Mo6 and those of P2W12Mo5V Dawson POMs are identical respectively, thereby suggesting the formation of a new species that would be the active species favorable for the carboxylic acid formation. It was reported that the presence of H2O2, in addition to its function to oxidize the POM, lead to the formation of “peroxo-POMox” [18,19]. On the other hand, it was also suggested that H2O2 can be involved in the peroxometal formation that is expected to give stoechiometrically oxygen atoms to the substrate [1]. In the case of P/W/Mo/V system, vanadium with its very high oxidation power would behave like a free ion and would decompose hydrogen peroxide and the active species “peroxo-POMox” would be in a reduced number contrary to the P/W/Mo system. This might explain its poor performance in adipic acid formation. It was reported, in the synthesis of adipic acid via nitric acid oxidation of cyclohexanol (or cyclohexanone) in a two step continuous process in the presence of V/Cu based catalyst, that in the first process step, there is formation of soluble oxidized intermediates as cyclohexanediol (or cyclohexanedione) that are then converted into adipic acid in the second step [31]. In the first process step, nitric acid reacts as oxidant and the VV species of catalyst, are involved only to a small extent and in the second step, the catalyst becomes more effective and the intermediates products are easily oxidized to AA. In this work, the different preliminary tests, carried out with P2W12Mo6 showed that the AA formation requires the existence of both substrate and catalyst. Hydrogen peroxide must be added progressively by fraction after every catalyst reduction by the substrate. AA is not observed in the absence of catalyst or hydrogen peroxide. On the other hand, 31P NMR results have suggested the formation of “peroxo-POMox” active species. Based on these results and according to the hypothesis of the adipic acid synthesis via nitric acid oxidation in two step continuous process, the following steps can take place in the cycle: Substrat+POM→oxidizedintermediateproducts+POMred POMred +H2O2 →“peroxo-POMox” Oxidizedintermediateproducts+“peroxo-POMox”→AA+POMox The catalytic cycle is finished when the POM catalyst is no longer reduced, indicating a direct participation of the catalyst in the rate-determining step of the process. 4 Conclusion The catalytic properties of α-P2W18, β-P2W18, α1-P2Mo5W13, α2-P2Mo5W13, α-P2Mo6W12 and α1-P2Mo5VW12 Dawson-type POMs were examined in the liquid-phase oxidation, of cyclohexanol and/or cyclohexanone in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Among the catalysts tested, α-K6P2Mo6W12O62 isomer exhibits the best performance with 59% of AA yield from both oxidation of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone and 69% of AA yield from oxidation of cyclohexanol (50%) and cyclohexanone (50%) mixture, composition corresponding to industrial process (KA oil). 31P NMR analysis showed that active species in the adipic acid formation can be “peroxo-POMox” form. This method presents an environmentally friendly for adipic acid synthesis, in absence of the solvent, phase-transfer agents and adding acid. References [1] R.H. Ingle N.K. Kola P. Manikandan J. Mol.
