PERSPECTIVE Addressing fundamental experimental aspects of photocatalysis studies Kazuhiro Takanabe Department of Chemical System Engineering, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan Department of Chemical System Engineering School of Engineering The University of Tokyo 7-3-1 Hongo Bunkyo-ku Tokyo 113-8656 Japan Graphical abstract Photon energy conversion and utilization are important topics in academic studies [1]. The trend is predominantly triggered by a desire to use the massive amounts of solar energy as a driver to establish widespread environmental remediation technology [2] and sustainable conversion technology for fuels and chemicals generation [3,4]. The interaction of ultraviolet, visible, and infrared radiation with matter leads to changes in electron levels that can be utilized to gain chemical potentials [5]. While photovoltaics only generates electricity, photocatalysis allows the direct reformation of chemical bonds via catalysis, resulting in thermodynamically downhill (photocatalytic) or even uphill (photosynthetic) chemical reactions [6]. Photocatalysis in this article indicates the completion of both the reduction and oxidation reactions using one reactor component without wiring [7]. This perspective discusses the field of “photocatalysis” based on the readership of the catalysis journals where the main focus is strongly associated with surface phenomena or coordination chemistries at the molecular level for commercially viable reaction processes. Some suggestions for papers in this field are discussed. Like many journals, the Journal of Catalysis has recently been receiving a large number of papers concerning photocatalysis, which require a substantial amount of initial screening before sending out the manuscripts to the reviewers. As in any field of study, the accumulation of new facts is encouraged. With any submission, a justification letter to describe the novelty of the work is always helpful for editors to judge whether an article is worth progressing to the next level. Unless the concept is completely new and has never been published, a clear statement to identify unknown facts in the literature and a strategy to resolve them are recommended in the first part of the article. The results and discussion section should then address the issues with clear evidence for the conclusions drawn. A research paper with high novelty in the field of catalysis is generally expected to demonstrate the concepts with unprecedented performance, characterization, and the reaction mechanism. Unprecedented performance refers to a new class of catalysts, material components, or a preparation method that outperforms reported data. Characterization refers to innovative characterization tools that enable the elucidation of unknown catalytic functions, and the reaction mechanism refers to unrecognized reaction mechanisms that change the concepts of how to improve catalysis and catalytic engineering. It is not preferable to assign novelty by just stating that something has never been reported. For example, using a random combination of materials just to call them a new composite may be considered a weak justification for novelty. A photocatalyst generally achieves photon absorption all the way to chemical bond reformation in a single reactor. As a consequence, any photocatalytic reactions contain both reduction and oxidation reactions (two half reactions), which resemble the reactions that are achievable by electrochemistry. Even if only reduction or oxidation reaction is the major concern in a study, it is important to report the other half of the reactions, as mentioned by Kamat [8]. There is clear consensus that photolysis (i.e., direct excitation of molecules to cleave or reform chemical bonds) is differentiated from photo-assisted catalytic reactions. Yet there still seems to be mixed use of the terms “photochemistry” and “photocatalysis” and the terms “photocatalytic” and “photosynthetic” reactions [6]. In the past, photochemistry was somewhat differentiated from photocatalysis, which represents a process that requires steady-state adsorption or coordination of the reactant, intermediate, or product on the catalyst. Nowadays, many photocatalytic reactions are reported, including some photochemical reactions that involve radical chemistries by electron transfer via outer-sphere reactions without coordination or adsorption of substances [9]. This essentially results from the difficulty of capturing elementary steps during the photochemical process due to the short timescale involved. Attention should be given to such differences in whether the reaction proceeds via photochemical radical chemistry or multiple electron transfer electrocatalysis [10], which has direct correlation with the efficiency-determining factors and thus provides clues about how to improve the efficiency further. After all, it should be confirmed that a photocatalyst substance can cause reaction turnovers greater than unity [11]. The accumulation of knowledge in the field of photo-assisted catalytic reactions has led to diverse photocatalyst components, catalytic reactions, and proposed reaction mechanisms. Nevertheless, there still seems to be a lack of consensus to identify “the unknown” [12], which should be reported in a comparable manner. This is essentially due to a lack of efforts to quantify the properties involved and the performance associated with photocatalysis [10]. Overall, a photocatalytic reaction involves a sequential reaction process comprising photon absorption, charge separation, charge carrier diffusion and transport, surface redox reactions, and reactant or product mass transfer. For successful photocatalysis, all of these processes must function efficiently. Additional complexity arises in photocatalysis from the processes involved that occur at completely different timescales, which range from the femto-second scale to the second scale. By understanding what process happens at which timescale, with an appropriate characterization tool, one can discuss what specific properties are to be improved to advance the overall performance [10]. Fig. 1 represents the time scales of events and properties involved in general photocatalysis [13]. The study of photocatalysis requires a combination of photochemistry, solid-state physics, electrochemistry/electrocatalysis, mass transfer, and reactor design. Studies have discussed the quantitative approaches in detail [14]. At the very least for manuscripts in photocatalysis, four key experimental procedures should be conducted relatively easily without sophisticated tools to judge which process most crucially affects the overall rates and efficiencies. Procedure 1: Varying the amount of photocatalyst and obtaining the “optimal rate” in a given photoreactor. When the photonic efficiency is of concern, the photocatalytic rate should be the optimal rate at which the amount of photocatalyst should not influence the overall performance [15]. The shape of the photoreactor changes the overall rate, even if the same photocatalyst and photon source are used. There is a range where the amount of photocatalyst is proportional to the overall rate, and the rate per gram of photocatalyst can be obtained. But comparing these values to judge the photonic efficiency is misleading because they cannot represent the saturation point of the optimal rate associated with the absorption coefficient (Fig. 2 ) [16]. A high absorption coefficient (cross section) does not necessarily lead to high photocatalytic efficiency as a whole. Thus, true photocatalytic efficiency is not determined under diluted conditions of the photocatalyst unless the reactor design is the sole concern. Procedure 2: Measuring the photon flux and varying the light intensity. It is strongly recommended to report the photon flux, which is the number of photons per given time as a function of wavelength [17]. Reporting the photocatalytic rate without the photon flux is like reporting the thermal catalysis rate without the reaction temperature or the electrocatalytic rate without the applied potential or current. Varying light intensity gives information about whether the performance is determined by either the photonic process or the mass transfer of the reactant. When the photonic process is limiting, the photocatalytic rate should monotonically increase with increasing light intensity. The relationship between the rate and intensity also gives some clues regarding the charge-recombination mechanisms for highly efficient semiconductors (photovoltaics) [18]. Most importantly, measurement of the photon flux enables a description of the photocatalytic performance that is comparable between other reactors or laboratories; i.e., the quantum yield or efficiency, using monochromic light [17], or more preferably action spectra—that is, multiple quantum yields as a function of wavelength measured using monochromic light [19]. The quantum yield does not drastically depend on the reactor as long as the optimal rate is reported at the defined photon flux, making it comparable between laboratories. When solar energy conversion is of concern, a use of Air Mass 1.5 G, a standard for photoelectrochemical community, should be effectively used. Any article should describe other experimental protocols that enable others to reproduce the study. The errors need to be reported inclusively with the results that are expected to be obtained with certain statistics and errors [20]. The experimental or theoretical protocols should be described in the article so that others can reproduce the study to obtain the same results [16]. Procedure 3: Varying the reactant concentration. Under the conditions at which the optimal rate is measured, the mass transfer of the reactant may influence the overall rate [21]. This is especially the case when remediation of organic molecule or toxic gas at low concentrations is of concern [6]. It is easy to check whether the overall rate is typically proportional to the reactant concentration (or at least positively related). If the reactant concentration is the sole limiting factor, increasing the surface area should help to enhance the overall performance [6]. If the limiting factor occurs prior to the surface reaction, the rate should not depend on the reactant concentration (zero-order). Procedure 4: Effectively comparing the photocatalytic performance with the electrocatalytic performance. Comparing the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic performance is effective when relatively effective charge separation is achieved and the surface redox kinetics is limiting. The surface kinetics can be comparatively slow (Fig. 1), especially when a multi-electron reaction is involved with a catalyst-decorated photon absorber, as in the case of water splitting and CO2 reduction. This results in the accumulation of charges at the catalyst sites [22–26]; that is, photocatalysis becomes merely electrocatalysis induced by photovoltage generated by the photon absorber. Focusing on the catalyst (the electrocatalyst in this case) by isolating it from the photon absorber; effective knowledge transfer is recommended from electrocatalysis to photocatalysis as much as possible. Further details of suggested procedures and setup of the photocatalytic experiments can be found in the Ref. [16] and the literature cited therein. As mentioned, a large number of photocatalysis papers are being submitted and published in many scientific journals. The following comments are given based on different principles and reactions. General aspects of solid state junction. When light absorption with a solid semiconductor is of concern, detailed understanding of solid-state physics is essential [27]. Detailed study of the crystallography of solids can yield useful parameters, such as the absorption coefficient, electronic dielectric constant, exciton binding energy and effective masses [28]. If solid-state physics plays a role, unconventional techniques besides photoluminescence quenching are preferred [29,30]. Detailed mechanistic studies of the solid-electrolyte interface are still being debated [27,31]. Theoretical descriptions of the solid-solid and solid-liquid interfaces are being developed [32] and will be the key for the improvement of solar-energy conversion technology. It must not be sufficient to discuss only band edges and work functions of the bulk materials. In addition, impact of atomic arrangement at the very interface on the electronic structure is worth investigating. On another note, many reports propose Z-scheme photocatalysis using two-photocatalyst composites without experimental evidence. While materials with narrower band gap could potentially be utilized, two photons are required to achieve the same reaction compared to a single photocatalyst. For the Z-scheme reaction to be successful, the two photocatalysts must show the same reaction rates, and thus, the slower photocatalytic rate limits the overall rate. This might be significant limitation of the Z-scheme system. Testing half reactions with probe molecules using the individual photocatalysts would help to understand the Z-scheme mechanism [11]. Metal organic framework (MOF) and covalent organic framework (COF). Researches on these porous materials are fashionable for various applications, and there are potential applications in photocatalysis [33]. Immobilization of a molecular photocatalyst can be achieved by introducing the framework structure, hopefully improving stability of the photocatalyst. However, the presence of organic nodes in the structure drastically lowers the mobility of excited carriers, inhibiting many MOF/COF materials from being used as a semiconductor powder for efficient photocatalysis. A breakthrough is necessary to make high carrier mobility MOF/COF materials. Plasmonic photocatalysis. There is mixed use between the phenomena of surface plasmon resonance and the plasmonic hot-carrier generation and utilization. Metal nanoparticles such as gold or silver nanoparticles are not semiconductors, and therefore, the energy diagram should not contain conduction and valence bands [34]. They are able to absorb visible light depending on the particle shape and size [35]. The reaction may be governed by the generation of hot electron injection at the junction, as in the case of dye-sensitized pathways [36]. Accordingly, it may be helpful to realize that the overall quantum yield for the induced photocatalysis is rather limited by such a process. In addition, metal particles that cause hot-carrier generation would simultaneously work as a catalyst that may enhance charge separation and the electrocatalytic reaction rate. These are generally called cocatalysts. Plasmon-resonance phenomena are interesting, but additional novelty beyond just the visible-light response is necessary to provide new insights in terms of the fundamental aspects or tuning energy levels of excitation according to the target reaction. H2 evolution and CO2 reduction. Tremendous progress has been made in photocatalytic hydrogen production [37]. When the photo-conversion is of concern, however, the efficiency is commonly too low to consider practical application [38]. A good measure is the photovoltaic-electrolyzer (PV + E) efficiency. Solar-to-hydrogen (STH) energy conversion efficiencies of >10% are being achieved [39], whereas the typical efficiency for a photocatalytic process is ∼1% [40,41]. To fill the gap, an apparent quantum efficiency greater than 50% is essential, especially in the visible light region. The main loss of efficiency originates from facile charge separation [6]. One critical parameter is short carrier lifetime. High surface area of the semiconductor would facilitate charge recombination at the surfaces [10]. When the efficiency becomes higher, the electrocatalysis and ion mass transfer will become more important [42]. It is recommended to isolate the processes and properties as previously mentioned. To truly pin down efficient charge separation at the interface, transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved X-ray, THz, or infrared spectroscopy should be used to capture the results of excited carriers [29,30,43,44], rather than demonstrating only arbitrary improvement of the overall photocatalytic efficiency. One must realize that unsuccessful utilization of photons for the reaction leads to charge recombination, generating heat or emission. For example, quantum efficiencies less than 1% means a comparison among more than 99% of photon recombination. A comparison of efficiency in such a small range of efficiency requires extra care to assign the improvement as the cause may be due to minor contributions. Comparing the performance of very bad photocatalysts and their improvement by multiple times does not make sense. On another note, make sure that the C source is the CO2 molecule by, e.g., isotope labeling, especially when the efficiency and resultant turnover are low. Ammonia synthesis. The photocatalytic generation of ammonia would be interesting if the counter reaction made the overall system photosynthetic, as in the case of O2 evolution from water [45]. The challenge is how to enhance the activity of nitrogen at the active sites. Like H2 evolution, the efficiency should be high enough to consider commercial competitiveness with the Haber-Bosch thermal process. Make sure that the N source is the N2 molecule by, e.g., isotope labeling. Photoredox organic synthesis and high-value-added products. Photoredox reactions that can be driven by UV, visible, and near-infrared light (∼1.0–3.5 eV) would be of great interest, and not just for water splitting. The focus of future studies should move towards photocatalytic organic transformations [46–48]. Various inorganic products, including hydrogen peroxide, redox-flow-battery-type redox chemical storage, and peroxydisulfate, etc. are of great interest especially when a conventional electrochemical approach cannot be done [49]. The study of molecular photochemistry is relatively mature in terms of theory compared to semiconductor powder photocatalysis, and discrete energy levels associated with molecular orbitals have been pointed out [13]. It has been applied in organic synthesis, including polymer synthesis. There seems to be limited interpretation of semiconductor photocatalysis originating from the knowledge commonly accepted in photochemistry studies nowadays, at least in the Journal of Catalysis. Collaboration between semiconductor experts and organic chemists would bridge gaps and may lead to immediately commercially viable processes. An obvious benefit of photocatalysis compared to thermal catalysis is that thermodynamically uphill reactions can be achieved, thereby storing photon energy (solar energy) in a chemical form [11]. From a thermodynamic and kinetic point of view, photocatalysis shares many phenomena with electrochemistry and electrocatalysis [10]. Many redox reactions achieved by electrochemistry are similar or often identical to what happens on the surface of a photocatalyst. Fundamental aspects are highlighted below to discuss what makes the photocatalytic process absolutely distinct from thermal catalysis, photovoltaic, and electrocatalytic processes: 1. Benefits of easy start-up shut-down by switching illumination on and off. Many photocatalytic reactions occur in ambient conditions. Due to the mild reaction conditions required, this nature is distinct from typical thermal catalysis, which requires high temperatures at steady-state operation. However, this on-off switching can be achieved by electricity input to an electrochemical system for most redox reactions. 2. Direct utilization of the potential difference between the Fermi level of the photocatalyst and the redox reaction potential at the interface. This aspect also prevails in photoelectrochemical (PEC) reactions [27]. This is due to the unique space charge layer at the catalyst-electrolyte interface, which cannot be achieved in a PV + E system, where the photovoltage is typically terminated by semiconductor-metal contact in the PV device. This is one of the critical benefits of a photocatalytic or PEC system that may overcome the achievable efficiency of PV + E systems [39]. At the current stage, however, inefficient charge separation at the solid-electrolyte interface and the slow kinetics of the redox reactions impede this benefit. 3. Nanoscale reduction-oxidation reactions. Typical photocatalyst materials complete redox reactions in close proximity (typically at the nanometer scale). Many semiconductor-based powder materials can be involved in both reduction and oxidation reactions with the same particles, or possibly even on the same surface. These nanoscale redox reactions are known to minimize the solution resistance and concentration overpotential, such as by enabling the splitting of pure water, unlike conventional water electrolysis, which requires a supporting electrolyte [42]. 4. Simultaneous production of reduction and oxidation products in close proximity. Product crossover happens due to redox reactions at close proximity. It would be interesting to convert reduced and oxidized products to form a single product from them. There might be some organic synthesis reactions that would not be achieved otherwise. This is not apparent in conventional electrochemistry where anode and cathode are located significantly far apart. On the other hand, this coproduction might become a disadvantage because photosynthetic reactions may lead to an explosive mixture, such as H2 and O2 from water splitting. 5. Making the semiconductor surface accessible to redox reactions. This is an interesting feature that makes photocatalytic reactions different from conventional electrochemistry, which requires electrically conductive electrodes. High resistivity of the semiconductor electrodes limits its availability for redox reaction under dark condition. A semiconductor surface may be unique in terms of adsorption capability. It would be fascinating if the surface intermediate on such surfaces alters the product selectivity via photocatalysis. As a concluding remark, science is based on the accumulation of knowledge that is independent of the place and the researcher. The maturity of a field of science may be reflected by the standardized protocols to report research papers. This perspective addressed some fundamental experimental aspects in the field of photocatalysis. The huge challenge in photocatalysis is the lack of consensus on what is “unknown,” i.e., finding the true novelty in this field. The accumulated knowledge should be comparable and based on consistent reporting protocols. This perspective could help to realize such points in the scientific research of photocatalysis.
