N. W. Eilerts, J. A. Heppert* and M. D. Morton Department of Chemistry, Uniuersity of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 (USA) Abstract Metallacyclobutadiene complexes with the formula (Me3SiCH2)4M2(P-CSiMe3)z (M = Ta or W) induce the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornene. The tungsten compound acts as a stand-alone catalyst, polymerizing norbornene with a first-order dependence on both WZ and monomer. In contrast, the tantalum complex requires oxygen as an initiator, and generates an as yet undefined catalyst that shows a zero-order dependence on the monomer concentration. There are only a few examples of dinuclear early transition metal complexes that act as metathesis catalysts [1-3]. In the first such example, it was proposed that an active ROMP catalyst is generated via CO loss from a Y2:ql,q3-metalla-allyl complex of tungsten (I), with subsequent incorporation of a cyclic olefin through the vacant coordination site. A second example employed dinuclear tungsten alkoxide and alkoxyhalide complexes (II, III), along with aluminum alkyl co-catalysts, as precursors for metathesis catalysts [2]. In a more recent observation, W2(OR)6 complexes (IV) have demonstrated metathesis polymerization activity after reaction with a single equivalent of ethyne [3]. While there is strong circumstantial evidence for the intermediacy of some of the species thought to be acting during polymerization by I, compounds II and III are clearly acting only as precursors for the generation of active catalysts that may or may not be dinuclear entities. We have recently refocused our attention on 1,3-dimetallacyclobutadiene derivatives (V, VI), which by all appearances should have excellent prospects as metathesis polymeriza- tion catalysts. The M-C-M-C core unit has numerous characteristics in common with highly active W- and Ta-based ROMP catalysts, including (a) low coordination number, (b) high formal oxidation state, (c) extreme electron deficiency, and (d) M-C multiple bond character. A further advantage of constructing a systematic study of dinuclear ROMP processes around these molecules is that the electronic characteristics of V and VI differ, due to the change in the M-M bond order on moving from the Group V to the Group VI metal [4]. Moreover, the relative ease *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved 158 Me ROB H R OR RO R OR j~M~ RO., I ,,,0.,,I ,OR CL.

We report here our preliminary efforts to elucidate the role of V and VI in the metathesis polymerization of norbornene. Toluene solutions of both (Me3SiCH2)4W2(u-CSiMe3)2 (V) and (Me3SiCH2)4Ta2(p-CSiMe3)2 (VI) containing norbornene react over a period of minutes at ambient temperatures to generate virtually quantitative yields of polynorbornene. Polymerization studies employing V, monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy, show a gradual decrease in the intensity of V as polymerization progresses, culminating in the complete consumption of the starting catalyst. Surprisingly, concurrent NMR studies employing VI show little perceptible change in the concentration and spectroscopic characteristics of VI over the duration of the reaction. This is the case until the toluene-d8/polynorbornene gel containing the Tae derivative is exposed to air, at which time the characteristic color of VI slowly bleaches from the sample. (t-BuCH20)4W2(JU-CS'Me3)2 (VII) [8] also initiates the polymerization of norbornene, although more coordinatively saturated derivatives, such as the confacial bioctahedral [(Et0),W2(p-CSiMe3)]2 complex [5], are completely unreactive. The isolated polymer displays some stereochemical characteristics consistent with analogues generated by more common mononuclear catalyst systems [9]. Compound V produces all-cis polynorbornene, with little spectroscopic evidence for the `crosslinking' impurities evident in norbornene polymer prepared using WCls/EtAIC12 catalysts. Complexes VI and VII produce polynorbornene with a substantially higher trans content (E:Z ratios of 1.0:2.1 and 1.0:1.6, respectively), but still appreciably free of evidence of crosslinking processes. Despite having a significant fraction of cis linkages (6. > 0.5), the latter two samples show little evidence of cis blockiness (rtr, = 0.92 and 1.00, respectively). This observation may reflect an inability on the part of the catalysts to coordinate an adjacent cis-olefin unit [9]. The observed stereochemistry of the polynorbornene 159 obtained from each catalyst shows no perceptible variation over a significant temperature range (-20 to 50 C). Kinetic studies of polymerization initiated by V and VI accentuate the differences in the mechanisms previously noted in the NMR studies. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the ROMP of norbornene by V exhibits a simple first-order dependence on both V and monomer concentrations over the entire range of concentrations studied. The second-order rate constant obtained from this study is 0.453 M-1 s-1. This observation is consistent with olefin binding to the catalyst being the rate-determining step in the reaction. Taken together with the slow but exhaustive consumption of V during the polymerization process, this could indicate that the polymerization propagates through the direct addition of norbornene across a p-CSiMe3 ligand. The initiating step could occur either through metalassisted ligation of the cyclic olefin (Scheme 1(a), VIII), which is consistent with the known chemistry of V [6], or through a more concerted addition of the olefin to a bridging alkylidyne unit (Scheme 1(b), IX). a) Metal-Assisted Initiation SiMe3 ~SiMe3 IN f S'Me3 _ C~ . ~C~SiMe3 ~ W ~ ~ j \\C 'N-* ~ \\CW ~ ~ _-W-W W-* S'Me3 Sime3 VIII S~Me3 SiMe3 b) Direct Initiation SiMe ~ SiMe ~ i \\ .~ S'Me3 ~' \\CSiMe3 ~W\\ /W~ ~ \\ W~ W- W` - pl C ~ C ~ C SiMe3 SiMe3 IX SiMe3 SiMe3 X c) Propagation Steps n C-.SIMe3 ~ ,,SiMe3 C~ SIMe3 _ _~ _ / . \\C W-,> ~ ~W\\di:,, N# \\ j C X Sime3 AN% S'Me3 Scheme 1. Potential mechanisms of norbornene polymerization by V. Propagation of the polymerization process through the a,co-vinyl alkylidene intermediate (X) must, however, occur through direct addition to the u-CSiMe, ligand (Scheme 1(c)). Rate studies of polymerization initiated by VI, in contrast, show a temperature-dependent induction period 160 that virtually disappears at 50 C. Maintaining a constant positive pressure of N2 in the reaction vessel greatly increases the length of this induction period, while the addition of up to one equivalent of dry 02 via gas-tight syringe dramatically reduces the induction time. It is evident from these and the associated spectroscopic studies that VI is not the actual catalyst; rather, it is a precursor for some 02 activated species. The difference in behavior between V and VI is further illustrated by studies of polymerizations employing VI at 48 C, shown in Fig. 1(b), which demonstrate that norbornene consumption has a first-order dependence on [VI] and a zero-order dependence on [monomer]. Such behavior is characteristic of reactions using more highly active mononuclear ROMP 2.2 SiMe3 0 (cat]=.004365 M (cat]=.003825 M 11,11.

Rate studies of norbornene polymerization by (Me3SiCH2)4Taz(u-CSiMe,)2, catalysts, in which the opening of the intermediate metallacyclobutane ring is the rate-determining step [10]. Although we have not, as yet, successfully isolated the catalyst acting in the VI/02 system, we have determined that the stoichiometry of the reaction system is critical, as the exposure of VI to excess OZ eliminates the catalyst activity. - The observed differences in the reactivities of V and VI are hardly surprising, considering their inherent electronic characteristics. V employs the reservoir of electrons in its W -W single bond to 7c-back-donate with unsaturated organic substrates. This interaction facilitates the binding and insertion of molecules into the p-CSiMe3 ligands [4, 6]. Because of a lack of available d electrons, VI shows no evidence in stoichiometric reactions for either the binding or insertion of small organic molecules, aside from CO [8]. 162 Efforts to unequivocally characterize catalysts based on WZ and Tae complexes are in progress. Our aims are to survey structurally related tc-hydrocarbyl derivatives to establish a range of compounds to show such activity, and to engineer complexes that are suitable for preparing isolable mono-norbornene insertion products. Experimental All syntheses of organometallic complexes, preparation of monomer solutions and polymerization studies were performed under dry nitrogen atmosphere. Catalysts were synthesized according to literature procedures [11-13]. Toluene was dried over Na/benzophenone. Norbornene was purchased from Aldrich and used as received. The norbornene stock solution was made with dry toluene degassed by several freeze-pumpthaw cycles and stored over sieves. Polymerization reactions were performed in serum-capped round-bottom flasks and stirred magnetically. Rate studies that required more than 25 min were performed under a positive nitrogen pressure. All studies employing the ditungsten compounds were performed at 0 C. Tae polymerization studies involving Oz were run at ambient temperature, while the VI rate study detailed was performed at 48 C. Kinetics were monitored by GC analysis of residual norbornene with mesitylene as the internal standard. Polymerization employing VI and 02 One equivalent of dry 02 was added via gas-tight syringe to a solution of VI in toluene. This mixture was allowed to stir for 0.5 h, and an appropriate volume of norbornene was added via syringe.
