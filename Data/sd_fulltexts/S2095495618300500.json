The electro-catalytic properties can be effectively optimized by designing bimetallic alloy nanoparticles with high-content less-active metal to enhance the competence of more-active noble metal. Herein, a one-pot hydrothermal approach is demonstrated for the controllable synthesis of Ag-rich Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae with obviously enhanced electro-catalytic activity (2.23 mA cm−2 at 0.85 V) and stability for oxygen reduction reaction. In alkaline solution, the ORR onset potential and half-wave potential of the Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae can reach a value of 1.02 V and 0.89 V, respectively, which origin from strong ligand and ensemble effects between Pd element and Ag element. The nanocrystals are uniformly alloyed, displaying a Ag9Pd1 combination, as displayed by an assembly of X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, and cyclic voltammetry (CV). This concept of tuning bimetallic alloy nanocrystals with low concentrations of more precious metal may be a promising approach to be applicable to a wide range of alloy nanocrystals. Graphical abstract A facile one-pot approach was designed for the synthesis of Ag-rich Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae, which exhibited high activities for ORR in alkaline media based on strong ligand and ensemble effects between Pd and Ag. Image, graphical abstract Keywords Ag-rich alloy Ag9Pd1 Hydrothermal synthesis Ligand and ensemble effects Oxygen reduction reaction Design and synthesis of high-performance electro-catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as promising portable energy sources have attracted enormous attention. Although Pt and its alloys are considered as the most efficient electro-catalysts for ORR application, their limited resource of Pt-based catalysts, extremely high cost, and poor durability have seriously impeded the development of these renewable energy devices [1–4]. In this regard, it is a strongly demand to investigate effective strategies for preparing catalysts with replacement of Pt while still exhibiting superior electro-catalytic performance [5–8]. Among non-Pt electro-catalysts, Pd-based nanoalloys recently have been explored as effective electro-catalysts for fuel cell application because Pd is more abundant and cheaper than Pt [9]. Considerable attention has been paid to design and synthesize Pd nanostructures in view of their predictable applications in electro-catalysis areas [10]. Additionally, less-expensive noble metals, take Ag as an example, also exhibit considerable activity for ORR [11]. Ag, which is proposed to effectively reduce the poisoning of CO-like species on the surface of catalysts, has been manifested as a promising alloying candidate to improve ORR performance because of its low cost (less than 1% of that of Pt), high conductivity, and improved CO tolerance capability [12–14]. During ORR process, oxidation resistance of Ag can be more steady compare to transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni). In alkaline solution, the polarization overpotential of Ag also can reach the value of 1.14 V, next to Pt (1.38 V), far exceeds Ni (0.87 V) and Cu (0.84 V). Accordingly, the strong adsorbability of O2 on the surface of Ag can theoretically reach superior electro-catalytic performance for ORR. Hence, PdAg alloy nanoparticles are becoming fascinating catalytic nanomaterials due to both efficacious and functional components of Pd and Ag [15–17]. Another important strategy to further enhance the electro-catalytic performance is to customize the content and proportion of two monometallic counterparts [18–20]. Such strategy can not only greatly decrease the usage of more expensive metal, but also simultaneously allow for tuning electronic states of the entire nanostructure, which often exhibits superior electro-catalytic activity, selectivity and durability [21,22]. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance of nanoalloy catalysts may be legitimate origin from the combination of ligand effect (nearest charge-transfer between neighbor atoms), and geometric effect (fundamental tensile and compressive strain) [23,24]. Thus, it is of great significance to synthesize bimetallic nanocrystals with strong ligand and geometric effects between blend compositions for ORR catalytic application. Additionally, precious metal contents of most ORR electro-catalysts are typically > 50% at present. It is economically desirable to design nanoalloy catalysts with low content of precious metals for increasing utilization [25,26]. Herein, we demonstrated a facile and novel approach for the one-pot synthesis of Ag-rich AgPd alloy nanoactiniae with the assistance of a functional polyme'tttr, poly (diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDDA, Fig. S1). The nanoactiniae were uniformly alloyed, displaying a Ag9Pd1 components based on the distinct different standard reduction potentials of Pd2+ and Ag+ precursors and the extremely large miscibility gap between Pd and Ag in the bulk. By analyzing the reduction process, the obtained Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae were obtained by particle spontaneous attachment process and subsequent self-assembly in one-pot synthesis. Based on the low content of precious Pd, the synergy effect during electro-catalytic process was motivated by the high degree of Pd − Ag bonds (vs. Pd − Pd bonds), thus promoted strong ligand and ensemble effects. As inspired by this, the as-prepared Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae displayed superior ORR performance in alkaline media by comparison with commercial Pd black. Poly (diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDDA, M w < 500,000 Da, molecular structure displayed in Fig. S1) was purchased from Alfa Aesar Co. Ltd. Potassium tetrachloropalladite(II) (K2PdCl4), silver nitrate (AgNO3), and 40% formaldehyde solution (HCHO) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). For comparison, commercial Pd black was obtained from Johnson Matthey Company. Other reagents have achieved analytical reagent standard and used without further purification. Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae were hydrothermally synthesized by one-pot. In a typical synthesis, 1 mL of 0.05 M AgNO3, 1 mL of 0.05 M K2PdCl4, 8 mL of DI water, and 2.0 mL of 0.50 M PDDA aqueous solutions were mixed with continued stirring. Then the pH value was adjusted to 13 using 2 M NaOH solution. After adding 1 mL of 40% HCHO solution into the mixture, the mixed solution was removed to a 20 mL eflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave quickly, and then kept heating at 120 °C for 4 h. Then the product was collected after cooling to room temperature, consecutive washing/centrifugation for three cycles with DI water and alcohol. A CHI 760 C electrochemical analyzer equipment (CH Instruments, Shanghai, Chen hua Co.) was used for measuring all electrochemical experiments. The electrochemical installation was performed using a standard three-electrode system including a Pt wire as the auxiliary electrode, a saturated calomel reference electrode, and a glassy carbon electrode modified by as-prepared catalyst as the working electrode. The entire electro-chemical measurements were proceeded at 30 °C and all potentials involved in this paper were displayed refer to the RHE. For preparing catalyst-located working electrode, An homogeneous suspension was performed by adding 10 mg as-prepared catalyst into 5 mL DI water, mixing for 30 min ultrasonically, and then 6 µL fully dispersed suspension was located on the exposed surface of the modified electrode and drying again. Thus, the total mass of catalysts loading on the modified electrode was about 12 µg. For cleansing and ECSA calculation, cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were carried out in 0.1 M KOH solution with a flow of N2 stream. ORR measurements were performed with a flow of O2 stream in 0.1 M KOH solution at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. During test process, we use a rotating disk electrode for keeping a rotation rate of 1600 rpm. CO-stripping voltammetry tests were measured on the basis of a procedure reported previously [27]. The detailed nanostructures and morphology features of the as-prepared products were observed and analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), a JEOL JEM-2100F model, operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. A model of JSM-2010 microscopy instrument was operated to observe scanning electron microscopy images (SEM) at 20 kV accelerating voltage. The composition of the catalysts was determined using EDX and ICP-AES techniques. A JEOL JSM-7600F scan electron microscopy instrument was used for EDX. ICP measurement was carried out on an IRIS Intrepid instrument (Thermo Fisher, USA). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns operated at 40 kV and 100 mA were used for determining the phase purity of as-prepared product with Cu K α radiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å). For studying surface properties, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was taken from a Thermo VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with a monochromatic Al K X-ray source (1486.6 eV photons). C 1s peak energy of 284.6 eV was used for calibrating the binding energy. TEM images of the as-prepared products recorded at different magnifications display a nanoactiniae-like morphology with an average diameter of ∼400 nm. Each nanoactiniae is composed of innumerable interlaced flexible nanowires (Fig. 1 (a)–(c)). In addition, each nanowire is consisted of connective joints with obviously seams (indicated by yellow curves in Fig. 1(b) and (c)). The EDS line scanning curve and the elemental mapping (Fig. 1(d)–(f)) are performed to reveal the existence and distribution of both Pd and Ag components. The Ag-rich feature and uniform element distribution of both Pd and Ag elements can be demonstrated throughout the whole nanoactiniae-like nanostructure. Combining with SEM images in Fig. S2, we can demonstrate that Ag-rich AgPd alloy nanoactiniae could be obtained in a succinct one-pot solution with uniform alloy structure. From the TEM image of an individual Ag-rich AgPd alloy nanoactiniae shown in Fig. 2 (a) and the size distribution histogram of each branch displayed in Fig. S3, the products exhibit uniform self-assembled nanowire branch with each diameter of ∼10 nm. High-resolution TEM analysis is performed to investigate the joints of each segments (Fig. 2b) and peripheral structure (Fig. 2c), which showing the obviously grain boundaries between adjacent segments. As shown in Fig. 2(c), clearly continuous lattice fringes of crystal structure are well-resolved with interplanar spacing of 2.30 Å, which is perfectly corresponding to the (111) lattice spacing of fcc AgPd alloy nanocrystals. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset of Fig. 2c) also implies a polycrystalline nature of the products. The EDS line scanning curve of a peripheral segment is performed (Fig. 2d), showing the integrity distribution of Pd and Ag elements, even at the branch terminals. It has been suggested that the mass of grain boundaries can serve as abundant electro-catalytic active sites and fixed transport pathway, leading to advance of electro-catalytic activity. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum analysis and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) are employed to reveal the bulk composition of AgPd nanoactiniae (Fig. 3 a). The atom ratio of Pd to Ag is measured to be 9.38:90.62, corresponding well with the ICP-AES result (Pd:Ag = 10.08:89.92), revealing the Ag9Pd1 alloy structure. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern is used to further confirm the microstructure (Fig. 3b). Neither a single Ag nor a single Pd component peak can be observed and five distinct diffraction peaks are well located between the standard positions of both pure Ag and pure Pd, corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes of AgPd, respectively, revealing the obvious well-crystallized alloying structure with fcc crystal form. The surface composition of the Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae is explored by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurement. As illustrated in Figs. 3(c), (d) and S4, both Ag and Pd elements exist predominantly as metallic states. Indeed, the binding energy of Ag 3d spectra in Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae has the similar value with standard Ag spectra (3d 5/ 2 = 368.40 eV; 3d 3/ 2 = 374.4 eV). The Pd 3d spectra in Fig. 3(d) are negligible shifted by −0.5 eV compared to the standard values of bulk Pd spectra (3d 5/ 2 = 334.90 eV; 3d 3/ 2 = 340.15 eV), which originated from the large amount of Ag atoms dispersed on the surface and an intensive charge density in d-band with debility in sp-band [28]. A set of time-dependent experiments were conducted to show the morphological evolution process and reveal the formation mechanism of Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae. The intermediate products recorded from different reaction times were observed by TEM (Fig. 4 ). The product collected before 30 min was composed of vimineous single nanowires. Then newly-formed one-dimensional nanowires gradually self-assembled to three-dimensional nanostructure. The average diameter of 10 nm was remained from the size of original nanowires. When the reaction continued to 4 h, the initial nanowires tended to finish interweaving with each other spontaneously and finally evolved into Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae. At this time, no individual nanowire was remained and the average diameter of nanowires kept almost unchanged throughout the whole process, indicating the final congeries were generated from the initial formed vimineous nanowires. Moreover, the number of parameters, such as introduction of additives and the concentrations of OH− also played important roles in the formation of Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae. From a series of parallel comparative experiments, the amazing simultaneously synthesis and self-assembly only happened at pH = 13, while irregularity nanoparticles appeared from pH = 9 to pH = 12 (Fig. S5). For comparison, when dislodging HCHO during the synthesis, adding only PDDA as both stabilizer and reducing agent, no Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae could be synthesized as the reduction potential changed (Fig. S6). Otherwise, if dislodging PDDA during the synthesis, adding only HCHO as reducing agent, the products were seriously aggregated, as PDDA was often used as surfactant, assembly agent, modifier and stabilizer. Accordingly, it was meaningful to reveal that the morphology of final products was extremely sensitive to various reaction parameters of the precursor solution. According to this, the formation of Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae might undergo a simultaneously synthesis and self-assembly course: (1) nucleation of vimineous independent alloy nanowires serve as building blocks. (2) Generation to form alloy nanoactiniae forced by further self-assembly, based on Van der Waals attractions, electrostatic forces, and dipolar interactions in the solution [29]. The possible formation mechanism of the Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae was schematically illustrated in Fig. 5 . As a consequence of the relative rich Ag content and low Pd content for overall Ag9Pd1 component and the uniform alloying structure, the single Pd atoms on the surface are principally surrounded by plentiful Ag atoms to the formation of Pd-Ag bonds, which can be determined by cyclic voltammetry measurements and CO stripping tests [30,31]. Fig. 6 (a) shows cyclic voltammograms of the Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae against the data for Pd black catalyst at sweeping rate of 50 mV s−1, recording in a N2-protective 0.1 M KOH solution. The CV of Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae shows two single oxide reduction peaks, for Pd element (0.56 V) and Ag element (0.94 V), respectively, revealing the effective electro-activity of both Ag and Pd atoms on the surface. CO stripping experiments (Fig. S7) also evidence the verdict from CV analysis, indicating that both active sites of Pd and Ag are effective on the surface. In summary, both Pd and Ag atoms throughout the surface are well alloyed and take charge for ORR activities, which is an essential factor for reaching high electro-catalytic performance based on ligand effects and ensemble effects between Ag and Pd. From the integration associated with reduction charges of surface Pd and Ag oxide in CV curve, the electro-chemical active surface area (ECSA) of Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae is measured to be 20.18 m2 g−1, 2.45 times higher than that of commercial Pd black catalyst (8.23 m2 g−1). The positively running ORR polarization curves of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 6(b), recorded in a solution of O2-protective 0.1 M KOH solution. Commercial Pd black was chosen to make a comparison with Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae as the ORR performance of commercial Pd black is much better than commercial Ag according to Ref. [25]. Compare with ORR catalysts from references (Fig. S8), the onset potential and half-wave potential for Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae are obviously positively removed, revealing a better catalytic ability for ORR at higher potential [7,31]. From the mixed kinetic-diffusion command area from 0.70 V to 0.95 V, Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae display both higher activity and more positive onset potential than those of Pd black. On account of Koutecky–Levich equation, the kinetic currents for ORR polarization curves are calculated. The specific (j k,specific) and mass activities (j k,mass) are displayed in Fig. 6(c) and (d), which are normalized against the ECSA and mass, respectively. Compared with the kinetic current densities of Pd black catalyst, both specific and mass activities of Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae are greatly enhanced. At 0.85 V, the j k,specific of the Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae is 2.23 mA cm−2, reaching 1.2 times than that of commercial Pd black catalyst (1.92 mA cm−2). For assessing the commercial potential, j k,mass (0.51 A mg−1) of Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae is a more critical indicator, which still reaching 2.8 times higher than that of commercial Pd black catalyst (0.18 A mg−1). To further evaluate the ORR kinetic parameters on the Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae, hydrodynamic voltammograms are recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 over a range of rotation rates of 100–2500 rpm (Fig. 7 a). High rotational speeds result in the increase in oxygen diffusion to the electrode surface and large currents. Fig. 7(b) shows the Koutecky–Levich plot for the ORR at 0.6 V. According to the slope value of the plot [32], the number of electrons involved in Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae during the ORR is deduced to be ca. 3.87. This indicates that there is nearly complete reduction of O2 to H2O, a four-electron process, on the surface of Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae. According to reference, the obviously enhanced electro-catalytic ORR performance is based on the homogeneous alloy structure as it optimizing both ligand effect and ensemble effect, which originating from electronic interactions and cooperation effect between 90% Ag and 10% Pd components [33–35]. Moreover, During ORR process in alkaline solution, the polarization overpotential of Ag can reach the value of 1.14 V, only next to Pt (1.38 V). As a result, the strong adsorbability of O2 on the surface of Ag can theoretically exhibit better ORR performance than Pd. Combining with the low cost, alkali resistance, and high conductivity of Ag, PdAg alloy nanoparticles, especially with rich Ag content, are becoming fascinating ORR catalytic nanomaterials. Herein, Fig. 8 display the ORR polarization curves before and after 1000 cycles in O2-protective 0.1 M KOH solution for Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae and Pd black. After 1000 cycles, the half-wave potential for commercial Pd black shows about 60 mV negatively shift, while there is only a 20 mV negative shift for Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae, indicating a better electro-durability during ORR polarization process for Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae. Moreover, for indeed understanding the durability, the ECSA before and after 1000 cycles for Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae and Pd black are also measured. As displayed in Fig. S9, the ECSA of Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae lost a slight ratio of 15.2%, whereas Pd black display an obvious loss of 42.4%. Combining with TEM images of Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae after 1000 cycles (Fig. S10), we can get the conclusion that Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae have a substantial structure for ORR durability. Ultimately, all these results indicate that the approach to alloying low contents of a highly-active noble metal (10% Pd) within a less-active metal (90% Ag) is an effective one to offer meaningful advantage for theoretical and practical advancement in electro-catalysis. In summary, a facile and straightforward hydrothermal approach was demonstrated to synthesize Ag-rich Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae. The obtained Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae were achieved by spontaneous nucleation and self-assembly behavior in a simple one-pot synthesis process with the assistance of PDDA. The high degree of PdAg versus PdPd bonds caused by the relative low Pd content was responsible for promoting strong ligand effects and ensemble effects. As inspired by this, the as-synthesized Ag9Pd1 alloy nanoactiniae showed obviously enhanced ORR electro-catalytic activity and durability compare to Pd black catalyst. This concept of customizing the proportion of two monometallic counterparts with low contents of more precious metals for strong synergy effect to enhance catalytic activity may be an effectively pathway to extend application for electrocatalysts.
