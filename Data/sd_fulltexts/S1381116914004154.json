These cyclic complexes were used as catalysts to promote the dynamic hydrolytic kinetic resolution (HKR) of epibromohydrin in order to evaluate the effect of the cyclic structures size on the cooperative bimetallic interactions. Since the obtained catalysts were easily recovered from the reaction mixture by simple filtration, their efficiency was evaluated in recycling procedures. It was found that both cyclic oligomer complexes (trimer and tetramer) and the mixture of calix-salen complexes delivered the expected diol with high enantioselectivity and yield. Tetramer calix-salen cobalt complex proved to be the most active and selective catalyst of the series. In this case, an optimal conformation to allow the formation of bimetallic species activating respectively both the epoxide and water as nucleophile is probably responsible for an efficient dual activation. Keywords Calix-salen Cobalt complexes Dynamic hydrolytic kinetic resolution Asymmetric catalysis Catalyst reuse 1 Introduction The high efficiency in terms both of activity and enantioselectivity of salen-derived complexes to achieve the formation of new bonds is well documented [1]. Such complexes have been indeed widely used, associated to numerous metallic precursors for the synthesis of valuable enantioenriched syntons [2] even at a large industrial scale [3]. Precisely in the context of epoxide ring-opening reactions [4], Jacobsen and his group demonstrated that catalysis occurred through cooperative bimetallic activation, with one metal centre acting as Lewis acid for epoxide activation, the other one as counterion for the nucleophile [5]. Numerous efforts have thus been devoted to the specific preparation of such catalysts that could favour this bimetallic interaction for efficient dual activation. For instance, salen–cobalt complexes have been modified as styrene derivatives for their homo- or copolymerization leading to either soluble or insoluble (recoverable) polymeric catalysts with catalytic sites placed in the space closed to each other [6]. Such complexes have been also immobilized in the nanocages of mesoporous materials (SBA-16) leading to enhanced activity and enantioselectivity due to the confinement [7]. Modified salen–cobalt complexes have further been assembled through non-covalent interactions such as urea–urea hydrogen-bonding to favour bimetallic activation [8]. Other examples are currently based on the formation of cyclic oligomer structures incorporating two or more salen derivatives to promote bimetallic interactions, as privileged paths. Such cyclic salen complexes have been obtained by Jacobsen and his group via polycondensation reactions between disalicylaldehydes (separated by a flexible linker) and chiral diamines [9]. Greatly enhanced results in terms both of activity and enantioselectivity where obtained in the presence of these cyclic salen–cobalt catalysts, for various asymmetric epoxide ring-opening reactions. Trigol-bis(aldehyde) and chiral diamines have also been condensed to deliver chiral cyclic dimers for which the corresponding CoIII-complexes proved also to be efficient and recyclable catalysts in hydrolytic kinetic resolutions (HKR) [10]. Olefin metathesis has also been exploited as a useful tool for the synthesis of macrocyclic oligomeric multinuclear salen–cobalt catalysts to access efficient cooperative catalysis [11]. Salen–cobalt complexes have also been installed in an original way on the upper rim of a calix-arene scaffold and they demonstrated cooperative activation [12]. In our ongoing studies, we have developed an heterogeneization procedure of salen complexes modified in the 5,5′-position of the salicylaldehyde core by polymerizable thiophene moieties. Electrochemical [13] or chemical oxidation [14] delivered indeed corresponding insoluble oligomers that could be engaged in various asymmetric transformations according to the incorporated metal [15]. These insoluble catalysts proved particularly stable and promoted the hydrolytic kinetic resolution of various terminal epoxides (even in a multi-substrate recovery procedure) in an efficient way, without the need for a reactivation step. The recovery methodology involved either a simple filtration in a batch reactor [15d] or a flow procedure with the catalyst dispersed in a silica support [14]. Nevertheless, bimetallic activation in those immobilized salen systems as a pearl neck lace could remain doubtful, since the enantioselectivity and activity obtained for the hydrolytic kinetic resolution in these conditions did not reach the high levels achieved in the case of the corresponding monomeric precursors. In this context we turned our attention towards the preparation of corresponding cyclic structures, called calix-salen, aiming at favouring cooperative multimetallic interactions. We have thus recently described the synthesis of new calix-salen derivatives via polycondensation reactions between various dialdehydes and enantiomerically pure diamines [16] and the use of the corresponding chromium complexes in ring opening of epoxides with trimethylsilylazide, in hetero-Diels Alder reactions, in dimethylzinc addition to aldehydes and in Henry reactions [17]. For these transformations, enantioselectivities could be indeed raised up in comparison to the values obtained from the linear counterparts. Consequently, we report here the efficiency of calix-salen cobalt complexes in the hydrolytic kinetic resolution (HKR) of terminal epoxides, particularly for the dynamic HKR of epibromohydrin with a specific care on the effect of the cyclic structures size. 2 Results and discussion For a direct comparison with the electrogenerated heterogeneous salen–cobalt complex (1, Fig. 1 ), we have firstly prepared the analogous cyclic ligand counterpart, by polycondensation between 5,5′-di(3-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-benzaldehyde)-2,2′-bithiophene) and (S,S)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine (2, Fig. 1) in ethanol [16]. The calix-salen was obtained in nearly quantitative yield and analyzed by Maldi-Tof spectroscopy as a mixture of cyclic oligomers from 2 to 6 repeating units. This mixture was then added to Co(OAc)2·4H2O salts and further oxidized in corresponding CoIII complexes (2-CoIII-OAc) by air oxidation in the presence of acetic acid. The benchmark transformation used to evaluate the efficiency of both thiophene-derived salen catalysts is the hydrolytic kinetic resolution of epibromohydrin 3. This substrate undergoes indeed fast racemization in the HKR conditions and the resulting diol 4 can consequently be obtained with complete conversion since, in this case, kinetic hydrolytic resolution proceeds in dynamic mode. The product can then be recovered and analyzed as acetonide derivative 5 for a straightforward determination of the transformation selectivity. Jacobsen and his group reported that 3-bromo-propane-1,2-diol was isolated in 93% yield and 96% ee, with 1.5equiv. of H2O in THF, in the presence of 2mol% of the classical bis-tert-butyl-cyclohexyl-salen CoIII-OAc catalyst [18] (Scheme 1 ). In these conditions, catalyst 1 delivered the targeted product in nearly quantitative isolated yield and with up to 87% ee. This heterogeneous catalyst was easily recovered, could be reused without the need for a reactivation step, and was highly stable, even after 11 consecutive catalytic runs [15d]. Accordingly, the CoIII catalyst derived from the thiophene-salen based ligand structure 2 provided acetonide 5 in 96% yield with 80% ee. Based on these results, our previously synthesized calix-salen derivatives 7, [16] prepared from disalicylaldehydes possessing a central phenyl backbone, were tested for their propensity to promote this transformation, as a mixture of cyclic cobalt-containing catalysts, but also as pure catalysts, after ligand isolation. Disalicylaldehyde 6 was thus prepared in nearly quantitative yield by Suzuki coupling between 1,4-dibromo-benzene and 3-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolan-2-yl)-benzaldehyde obtained from 2-tert-butylphenol. Subsequent condensation with (S,S)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine delivered calix-salen 7 as a mixture of oligomers possessing 2, 3, 4 or 5 salen units. Controlling the dilution of this last step of the transformation allowed for the targeted synthesis of either the dimeric or the tetrameric species as major product. The calix-salen derivatives could be hence isolated in their pure form, after chromatographic separation on silicagel [16] (Scheme 2 ). Cobalt complexes were prepared from these ligands in two steps, in the presence of Co(OAc)2·4H2O to yield corresponding calix-salen CoII complexes 8 which were further oxidized with acetic acid under oxygen atmosphere. Due to the very poor solubility of these structures in organic solvents, a precise structural characterization was not straightforward. Specifically, the reaction performed between cobalt salts and the dimeric calix-salen ligand that should deliver 9-Co2-OAc led to a mixture soluble in dichloromethane. Comparative UV measurements were thus performed that produced UV–vis spectra showing almost no difference between the ligand and the targeted complex with two absorption maxima at about 258 and 305–310nm for both species (see UV spectra in ESI). This was confirmed by mass analyses indicating that no cobalt was coordinated into the salen moieties. Both samples indeed showed peaks at M+H+ and M+Na+ at 1017.62 and 1039.61, respectively by positive electrospray analyses. Kleij and coworkers succeeded to introduce Co-OTs groups in salen-based dimeric structures; they are nevertheless lacking the sterically hindering tert-butyl group and they possess a slightly longer and more flexible spacer between both salen units [11d]. ATR-IR analyses were performed with the other complex mixtures which were insoluble in common organic solvents. Some conclusions can be drawn from the recorded spectra. In the ligand corresponding to the trimeric species a broad large band centred at 3252cm−1 is representative for the stretching of the OH vibration (see IR spectra in ESI). This band clearly disappears in both spectra for 8-Co3 and 9-Co3-OAc. Furthermore the band corresponding to the ν(CN) stretching vibration, initially present at 1628cm−1 in the free ligand is centred at about 1609cm−1 for both cobalt complexes. A same description is valid for the tetrameric species, specifically for the ν(CN) vibration. The band characteristic for the OH vibration, however, could ever be detected after coordination of the cobalt salt. In this case probably, we assume that all coordination sites are not occupied by a cobalt atom, as expected. The spectra recorded for the mixture of complexes matches a superposition of all previously described spectra. Catalytic tests were then performed with these new complexes and the cobalt–calix-salen mixture, 9-Co n -OAc, was first engaged as heterogeneous catalyst to promote the hydrolytic kinetic resolution of epibromohydrin 3. The reaction was stirred for 20h at room temperature and the supernatant was removed for GC analysis, after the formation of the less polar acetonide derivative 5. The catalyst was rinsed with THF, dried, and further involved in four other similar catalytic runs. Delightfully, the first cycle allowed the recovery of the targeted product with a complete conversion and a high enantiomeric excess (88%, Table 1 , entry 1). These values perfectly match the ones that were obtained by using the analogous linear cobalt complex, synthesized through oxidative polymerization. Furthermore, these values remained stable, specifically in terms of selectivity for all the subsequent runs, and the product was still recovered with 89% ee for the fifth use of the same cobalt calix-salen mixture. A reactivation step involving addition of acetic acid to the catalyst was nevertheless necessary between the 4th and the 5th run to ensure high conversion after 24h reaction time (Table 1, entry 5) [5a,19]. To get more insight into the nature of the active species for this transformation from the mixture, each calix-salen oligomer 7 isolated in its pure form after chromatographic separation on silicagel, was then independently reacted with cobalt salts to synthesize the corresponding pure complexes. They were then engaged, in the same conditions than those used for the catalyst issued from the oligomers mixture, to promote the hydrolysis of epibromohydrin. The mixture issued from the dimer after attempted cobalt complexation was tested in the same conditions, but as expected it did not show any activity, even after a prolonged reaction time, confirming that no cobalt salts could be inserted in this dimeric ligand. 9-Co3-OAc was contrarily an active catalyst, but proved to be by far less efficient than the mixture, 9-Co n -OAc. In terms of selectivity values, indeed, the trimer complex delivered the targeted compound in 89% ee from epibromohydrin for the first run, but the conversion reached only 55% after 20h reaction (see Table 2 , entry 1). This trimer species was reused for three more runs, showing however a loss in activity at each reuse. After the fourth cycle, product 5 was only produced with 40% conversion, after a prolonged reaction time of 168h. The selectivity values remained nevertheless interestingly stable, and very high, between 89% and 98% for each run (see Table 2, entry 4). By far better results were obtained for the catalysis performed in the presence of the tetramer complex 9-Co4-OAc (see Table 3 ). This catalyst was the most active and selective catalyst among the series of the purified species. The reaction rate was very high and product 5 was formed with a complete conversion and a high ee of 92% after the first run (Table 3, run 1). The catalyst was reused, demonstrating its stability in terms of enantioselectivity values (Table 3, runs 2–5), but the activity decreased still slightly with the recycling. The kinetics of these transformations has been compared, for the first use of each purified catalyst. The obtained kinetic data are reported in Fig. 2 , and initial rates of each cyclic catalyst were obtained from the conversion/time plots. 9-Co4-OAc proved to be by far the most active catalyst with an initial rate of 0.23mmolmin−1. Contrarily, 9-Co3-OAc promoted the reaction with a hundred times lower rate value of 0.0015mmolmin−1 and an induction period of about 25min. Behaviour of the catalyst mixture is obviously between both values. The existence of induction time for the HKR catalyzed by a salen CoIII-OAc complex has been reported [5b] attributed to the formation of the crucial in situ generated CoIII-OH species. It seems in this case that the length of this induction period is highly related to the structure of the catalyst, and is conceivably here greater for the more sterically hindered trimeric complex compared to the analogous tetramer. Notably however, the here reported initial rate for the tetrameric species is much more important that the rate stated for corresponding linear oligomeric complexes, obtained from electrochemical or chemical polymerization. We indeed in this case recorded initial rates varying between 0.003 and 0.006mmolmin−1 for reactions performed in similar conditions except that the mixture was further diluted (three times) [15d]. A huge rate improvement could thus be obtained by the use of the calix-salen cobalt complexes compared to the linear analogues as was already observed by Jacobsen and his group [9,21] and others [11b,c]. This could be rationalized by the easier formation of adjacent CoIII-species for the activation of both the epoxide and the nucleophile to form a bimetallic complex responsible for high activity and enantioselectivity [5]. 3 Conclusion We have thus prepared new calix-salen cobalt complexes able to promote the hydrolytic kinetic resolution of epibromohydrin with high efficiency. More specifically, the isolated tetramer cobalt complex proved to be the most active and selective catalyst of the series, by far more efficient than previously reported corresponding oligomeric linear analogues. As already proposed in the bibliography, we suggest that, in our case, the cobalt active sites may be placed in an optimal conformation to allow the formation of bimetallic species responsible of an effective cooperative activation of both the epoxide and water as nucleophile, responsible of an effective cooperative bimetallic activation. Avoiding a supplementary purification step towards isolation of the tetramer cyclic oligomer, the mixture of calix-salen complexes delivered also the expected diol with high enantioselectivity. Remarkably, these catalysts could be easily recovered from the reaction mixture by simple filtration and reused in another run to produce the targeted diol with steady enantioselectivity but decreasing yield. As already reported for cobalt acetate complexes delivering gradually non-nucleophilic CoOH species, a reactivation step with acetic acid was needed to recover a high activity. Work is in progress to report the activity of such cyclic salen complexes for other enantioselective transformations, for which cooperative activation is fundamental. 4 Experimental 4.1 General information Reactions (except catalytic transformations) were carried out under argon in oven-dried glassware with magnetic stirring. THF was distilled from sodium/benzophenone and DCM was distilled from CaH2 before use. IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Vertex 70 ATR-Diamond spectrometer and are reported in cm−1. UV–vis spectra were obtained using a Bio-TEK UNIKON XL spectrophotometer. Mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker MicroTOF-Q daltonics spectrometer. GC analyses were performed on a GC Shimadzu 2010-Plus, FID, SSL. The conversion was determined by using the column VF 1MS 15m×0.25mm×0.25μm (110°C, 10min to 250°C, 2min). The enantioselectivity of the reactions were determined with a Chiraldex column B-PM 50μm×0.25μm×0.12μm, isotherm 110°C. The synthesis of the calix-salen mixture 2, 7 and the purification of 7 has been recently described in Ref.

A reference sample was prepared by adding a small drop of the solution to THF. On the other hand, the solution was introduced in a tube containing catalyst (0.02equiv., 0.032mmol, 20mg), then H2O (1.5equiv., 2.47mmol, 44.5μL) was added. The reaction mixture was further stirred for about 24h (see tables) at room temperature. At the end of the reaction, the catalyst was filtered off, washed with THF, dried under vacuum and then reused for the next cycle. The recovered filtrate was concentrated by removing the solvent by rotary evaporation. Dimethoxypropane (3.32equiv., 5.47mmol, 677.4μL), CH2Cl2 (7.3ml) and 27mg of Amberlyst 15 were added to the crude product. The reaction mixture was further stirred for 16h at room temperature.
