Graphical abstract In this work, the mechanism of water oxidation catalyzed by a tricopper-containing polyoxometalate (POM) [(SbW9O33)2CuII 3(H2O)3]12− ([POM-CuII 2CuII OH2]12−), including (i) the deprotonation oxidation and (ii) OO bond formation steps, was theoretically investigated for the first time. Calculations suggest that the Cu center is redox-inert and remains bivalence throughout the catalytic reaction. This is significantly different from the Ru-, Co- and Mn-containing POM-based water oxidation catalysts in which the metal centers (Ru, Co, Mn) are sequentially oxidized and reduced during catalytic reaction. In deprotonation oxidation step, two hydrogen atoms are removed from one water ligand. Therefore, an unusual metal-oxyl-radical species [POM-CuII 2CuII O ]12− is obtained, in which two unpaired electrons are assigned to the active O center. A monocopper-containing keggin POM [CuII(O )SbW11O39]5− ([POM-CuII O ]5−) was selected as the model to explore the OO bond formation mediated by [POM-CuII 2CuII O ]12−. The OO bond formation was proposed to proceed via the single electron transfer-water nucleophilic attack (SET-WNA) mechanism. Two electrons from the incoming water molecule is step by step transferred to the oxyl-radical ligand of [POM-CuII O ]5−. Furthermore, the SET-WNA process is characterized by two-state reactivity and the observed spin inversions between two potential energy surfaces effectively reduce the activation barrier. Therefore, the present work would provide the promising information for further designing water oxidation catalysts (WOCs).

In this manner, solar energy is stored into chemical bonds, which is similar manner as done by photosystem II of green plants and algae [2]. Based on electrochemical perspective, the water splitting reaction includes two half-reactions: (i) water oxidation 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−; (ii) proton reduction (4H+ + 4e− → 2H2). Particularly the water oxidation half-reaction is not only energy demanding, but also high overpotentials needed because it involves four HO bonds ruptures, removal of four electrons and four protons, and an OO bond formation. Thus the water oxidation half-reaction is generally regarded as the bottleneck of efficient water splitting reaction [3]. One of the potential strategies for overcoming high activation energies is to use transition metals (TMs)-containing complexes as catalysts. To date, a considerable number of complexes containing Ru, Co, Ni, Fe, Cu, Mn have been reported as water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) [4]. Among them, Cu-based complexes have been regarded as promising WOCs due to their excellent activity, great stability and relatively low light-absorptivity [5]. However, under harsh reaction conditions, the organic ligands of organometallic-based WOCs are thermodynamically unstable, which ultimately result in inactivation of catalysts. Therefore, the design and synthesis of efficient catalysts with high stability are imperative for efficient water oxidation reaction. In this circumstance, polyoxometalate (POM)-based WOCs are distinct and attractive since they are oxidatively resistant and hydrolytically stable in certain pH ranges [4c,6]. In 2018, Ding group reported a tricopper-containing POM-based WOC [(SbW9O33)2CuII 3(H2O)3]12− ([POM-CuII 2CuII OH2]12−, 1, Fig. 1 ) [7], which is the first Cu-containing POM-based catalyst for O2 production via electrocatalytic water oxidation at neutral pH condition. Each CuII center (Cu1, Cu2, Cu3) in 1 coordinates with four O atoms from two POM ligands and one water molecule, which results in a sandwich-type assembly. That is, three CuII centers are equally reactive sites and locate in the identical chemical environment. Atomistic level understanding of catalytic process is indispensable for improving the activities of catalysts and designing more excellent catalysts. Considering the bulkiness and structural complexities of POM-based WOCs, revealing their catalytic mechanisms remain challenging from experimental insight. Therefore, the computational strategy has been highly expected. In 2013, the catalytic mechanism on tetraruthenium-containing POM-based WOC [Ru4O4(OH)2(H2O)4(γ-SiW10O36)2]10− was theoretically explored [8]. The RuVI-oxo species is obtained after stepwise oxidation of tetraruthenate core, which triggers the water nucleophilic attack (WNA) and O2 release. Meanwhile, our group investigated the reaction mechanism of the monoruthenium-containing POM-based WOCs [RuIII(H2O)SiW11O39]5− and [RuIII(H2O)GeW11O39]5− using density functional theory (DFT) calculations [9]. The OO bond formation was proposed to occur via WNA mechanism from the RuV-oxo species. In 2017, Poblet group theoretically elucidated the catalytic process of the tetracobalt-containing POM-based WOC [Co4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2]10− [10], in which the CoIII-oxyl-radical species was proposed to be responsible for OO bond formation via WNA mechanism. Recently, the water oxidation catalyzed by a polyoxometalate-based complex [Mn3(H2O)3(SbW9O33)2]12− was theoretically investigated by our group and the MnV-oxo species is computed to be responsible for OO bond formation via WNA mechanism [11]. However, the study on catalytic mechanism mediated by Cu-containing POM-based WOC is absent. In present work, we detailedly investigated the water oxidation catalyzed by 1, including (i) the deprotonation oxidation and (ii) OO bond formation steps, using DFT methods. 2 Computational details All optimizations were performed by DFT approach with (U)B3LYP hybrid functional [12] in Gaussian09 program package [13]. The solvent effect was included with the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) and water solvent [14]. The LANL2TZ(f) [15], LANL2DZ [16] and 6-31G(d, p) [17] were applied for the Cu, W/Sb and H/O, respectively. The intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were performed to verify the correct connection between transition state (TS) and corresponding reactant/product. In addition, single-point calculations were performed at the (U)M06 [18]/[6-311+G(d, P)/SDD(f) [19] level to examine the potential energy surfaces (PESs) The minimum energy crossing point (MECP) between two PESs with different spin states was located using the method proposed by Morokuma et al. [20]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Deprotonation oxidation The ground state of 1 is quartet as the spin population on each CuII center is 0.7 |e|. The average distance among three Cu centers is as long as 4.90 Å, indicating the weak interaction among three CuII centers. Therefore, to simplify the calculations, a single-site pathway in which only one Cu center (Cu1) as well as its water ligand is involved and other two Cu centers (Cu2, Cu3) are kept in high-spin d9 electron configurations, was proposed [8,10,21]. The catalytic cycle of water oxidation by 1 is present in Scheme 1 . The electronic configurations of reactive Cu center as well as its active ligand for the species in deprotonation oxidation step are shown in Fig. 2 , and the spin densities and frontier molecular orbitals of selected species in deprotonation oxidation step are shown in Fig. 3 . The 1 4 firstly undergoes an electron-removal event and a proton-removal event, which result in the species 2. The ground state of 2 is quintuplet (2 5, see SI for details). As shown in Figs. 2b and 3a, the spin populations on both Cu1 and O(H) centers in 2 5 are 0.7 |e|, indicating that the 2 5 is a CuII OH-radical species and could be recorded as [POM-CuII 2CuII OH]12−. Therefore, for 1 4 → 2 5 ([POM-CuII 2CuII OH2]12− → [POM-CuII 2CuII OH]12− + e− + H+), the Cu1 center remains high-spin d9 configuration and the removed electron is formally assigned to the water ligand. The 1 4 → 2 5 via a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway is an endothermic process with a free energy change (ΔG) of 57.9 kcal mol−1. Once 2 5 is obtained, the second proton-/electron-removal event proceeds to form species 3 and the ground state of 3 is sextet (3 6). As shown in Figs. 2c and 3b, the spin populations on Cu1 and O centers for 3 6 are 0.7 |e| and 1.6 |e|, respectively. Therefore, the 3 could be recorded as [POM-CuII 2CuII O ]12−, in which two unpaired electrons are assigned to the active O atom. Thus in 2 5 → 3 6 ([POM-CuII 2CuII OH]12− → [POM-CuII 2CuII O ]12− + e− + H+), one hydrogen atom is removed from OH moiety of 2 5 and the Cu1 center keeps high-spin d9 configuration. The 2 5 → 3 6 via a PCET pathway is also endothermic and the ΔG value is 48.2 kcal mol−1. The 3 6 is expected to be reactive species to trigger OO bond formation. As shown in Fig. 3c, the β spin lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)+2 (β-LUMO+2) of 3 6 has significant CuO π-antibonding orbital characteristics and the p orbital of oxyl-radical has main contribution to β-LUMO+2. Therefore, the β-LUMO+2 of 3 6 can compatibly overlap with the highest occupied molecular orbital of the incoming water molecule to facilitate the electron transfers (ETs) from the incoming water molecule to 3 6, which finally promotes the OO bond formation. In short, in deprotonation oxidation step (1 4 → 2 5 → 3 6), two hydrogen atoms are removed from the water ligand of 1 4, which result in an unusual CuII-oxyl-radical species 3 6. Noteworthily, the Cu1 center is redox-inert and remains high-spin d9 configuration in deprotonation oxidation step. This is different from Ru-, Co- and Mn-containing WOCs, in which the reactive metal (CoII, MnII, RuIII/IV) centers are oxidized to high-valence (CoIII, MnV, RuV/VI) and the metal-oxyl-radical/metal-oxo (CoIII O , MnV O, RuV/VI O) species are obtained to be responsible for OO bond formation [8–11,21,22]. 3.2 OO bond formation In consideration of bulkiness and structural stability of POM-based WOC, the mechanism for OO bond formation via intermolecular OO coupling between two metal-oxo/metal-oxyl species can be excluded [7–9]. In 1 4, the average distance between two O atoms from two water ligands is as long as 9.25 Å, indicating that the intramolecular OO coupling is impossible for OO bond formation. In 2017, Maseras group confirmed the existence of the single electron transfer-WNA (SET-WNA) mechanism for the OO bond formation mediated by Cu-containing WOC [23]. In SET-WNA mechanism, two electrons from the incoming water molecule are step by step transferred to the active metal-oxyl-radical or metal-oxo species. Thus the SET-WNA mechanism is employed for OO bond formation in present work. Considering the computational cost, a monocopper-containing keggin POM [Cu(O)SbW11O39]5− (3a, see Fig. 4 a) was selected as a model to explore the reactivity of 3. The ground state of 3a is a CuII-oxyl-radical (3a 4) species confirming by the spin populations of 0.8 |e| for Cu center and 1.6 |e| for O center (see Fig. 4b). In doublet 3a (3a 2), the spin populations on Cu and O centers are 0.8 |e| and 0.1 |e|, respectively, indicating that the electronic configuration of Cu center in 3a 2 is d9 high-spin and 3a 2 could be recorded as [POM-CuII O]5−. The 3a 4 is more stable than 3a 2 by 5.3 kcal mol−1 in energy. As shown in Fig. 4c, the β-LUMO+2 of 3a 4 also exhibits significant CuO π-antibonding orbital characteristics. Therefore, 3a can be a suitable model for investigating mechanism of OO bond formation mediated by 3. Fig. 5 presents the energy profiles of SET-WNA from 3a for OO bond formation. The electronic configurations of the Cu center as well as its active ligand for several stationary points in the PES are shown in Fig. 6 . The SET-WNA consists of three fundamental processes: (i) the first ET, (ii) the second ET, and (iii) proton transfer (PT). The first ET involves one ET from the incoming water molecule to 3a, in which the most favorable reaction pathway initiates from 3a 4 and then proceeds through the doublet and quartet PESs in turn to obtain the quartet species 4a (4a 4). From 4a 4, the second ET proceeds in the quartet and doublet states successively to generate the doublet species 5a (5a 2). The final PT event switches to the doublet PES to obtain doublet species 6a (6a 2). Spin inversions between the doublet and quartet PESs can be observed and significantly reduce the activation barrier. This spin-cross phenomenon is termed as “two-state reactivity”, which has been confirmed as a new concept in organometallic chemistry [24]. For SET-WNA, the rate-determining step is the first ET and the barrier (ΔG°≠) is 15.9 kcal mol−1. In the first ET (3a 4 → 4a 4), the doublet and quartet PESs cross since the structures of stationary points in two PESs are similar.24h These spin inversions alter the most favorable reaction pathway through two MECPs (purple hollow circles).24h During the first ET, one electron from the incoming water molecule is transferred to 3a 4 to pair with one unpaired electron of oxyl-radical ligand (see Fig. 6a and b). Meanwhile, one proton from the incoming water molecule is transferred to the oxyl-radical ligand of 3a 4. Therefore, the species 4a 4 containing a hydroxyl-radical ligand and a hydroxyl-radical is obtained and can be recorded as [POM-CuII OH⋯ OH]5−. In 4a 4, the H-bond interaction between the hydroxyl-radical ligand and hydroxyl-radical is observed (d O H⋯O H = 1.93 Å). The ΔG°≠and ΔG values for the first ET are 15.9 and 12.9 kcal mol−1, respectively. In the second ET (4a 4 → 5a 2), the spin inversion is also observed between doublet and quartet PESs, which effectively reduces the reaction barrier. The PES switches from the quartet state to the doublet state via a MECP. As shown in Fig. 4d, the p orbital of O atom for hydroxyl-radical ligand has significant contribution to β-LUMO+2 of 4a 4. The β-HOMO-3 of 4a 4 (shown in Fig. 4e) mainly localizes on the hydroxyl-radical. Therefore, the β-LUMO+2 and β-HOMO-3 of 4a 4 effectively overlap with each other, which results in the ET from hydroxyl-radical to hydroxyl-radical ligand (see Fig. 6b and c) and OO bond formation. From 4a 4, the hydroxyl-radical closes to the hydroxyl-radical ligand through the doublet TS2 (TS2 2) to obtain the 5a 2. Therefore, 5a 2 is recorded as [POM-CuII OHOH]5−. The second ET is a significantly exothermic process with a ΔG value of 36.8 kcal mol−1 and the ΔG°≠ value is 15.7 kcal mol−1. In the PT (5a 2 → 6a 2), one proton from the OHOH ligand in 5a 2 moves toward one Ob atom of POM ligand through the doublet TS3 (TS3 2) to afford the doublet species 6a (6a 2, ([POM-CuII OOH⋯H]5−).[8] In 6a 2, an OOH ligand is included. The ΔG and ΔG°≠ values for this step are 3.7 and 1.3 kcal mol−1, respectively. In addition, since the 1e-oxidized form of Cu species was proposed to be responsible OO bond formation in the previous reports [5d,5e], herein, the OO bond formation via WNA mechanism from the species [POM-CuO]6− (3a1e ) was investigated. The ground state of 3a1e is triplet ( 3a 1e 3 ). The spin populations on Cu and O centers of 3a 1e 3 are 0.9 |e| and 1.0 |e|, respectively, indicating that 3a 1e 3 could be recorded as [POM-CuII O ]6−. However, the 3a 1e 3 is demonstrated to be poor activity due to the absence of electron acceptor unoccupied orbital in 3a 1e 3 (more details are shown in Supporting Information) [25]. In short, the two electrons from the incoming water molecule are step by step paired with two unpaired electrons formally assigned to oxyl-radical ligand of 3a 4. Therefore, the Cu center still exhibits redox-inertness and keeps bivalence, which is different from those of Ru-, Co- and Mn-containing WOCs. For Ru-, Co- and Mn-containing WOCs, two electrons from the incoming water molecule are transferred to oxyl-radical/oxo ligand and metal center (CoIII, MnV, RuV/VI) of metal-oxyl-radical/metal-oxo species, respectively, in which the metal center is reduced [8–11,21,22]. 4 Conclusion In present work, the mechanistic details of water oxidation catalyzed by a tricopper-POM [POM-CuII 2CuII OH2]12−, especially deprotonation oxidation and OO bond formation steps, have been theoretically investigated. During deprotonation oxidation step, the two hydrogen atoms are removed from the water ligand of [POM-CuII 2CuII OH2]12−, which result in an unusual metal-oxyl-radical species [POM-CuII 2CuII O ]12−. The monocopper-containing keggin POM [POM-CuII O ]5− was selected as suitable model to disclosed OO bond formation mediated by [POM-CuII 2CuII O ]12−. The OO bond formation was proposed to proceed via SET-WNA mechanism. The two-state reactivity for SET-WNA process is observed and the spin inversions between two PESs with different spin state effectively decrease the activation barrier. During SET-WNA process, the two electrons from the incoming water are step by step transferred to the oxyl-radical ligand of [POM-CuII O ]5−. Importantly, throughout the catalytic reaction, the Cu center is redox-inert and remains bivalence, which is different from that for Ru-, Co- and Mn-containing WOCs.

        "dc:description": "In this work, the mechanism of water oxidation catalyzed by a tricopper-containing polyoxometalate (POM) [(SbW9O33)2CuII 3(H2O)3]12− ([POM-CuII 2CuII OH2]12−), including (i) the deprotonation oxidation and (ii) OO bond formation steps, was theoretically investigated for the first time. Calculations suggest that the Cu center is redox-inert and remains bivalence throughout the catalytic reaction. This is significantly different from the Ru-, Co- and Mn-containing POM-based water oxidation catalysts in which the metal centers (Ru, Co, Mn) are sequentially oxidized and reduced during catalytic reaction. In deprotonation oxidation step, two hydrogen atoms are removed from one water ligand. Therefore, an unusual metal-oxyl-radical species [POM-CuII 2CuII O ]12− is obtained, in which two unpaired electrons are assigned to the active O center. A monocopper-containing keggin POM [CuII(O )SbW11O39]5− ([POM-CuII O ]5−) was selected as the model to explore the OO bond formation mediated by [POM-CuII 2CuII O ]12−. The OO bond formation was proposed to proceed via the single electron transfer-water nucleophilic attack (SET-WNA) mechanism. Two electrons from the incoming water molecule is step by step transferred to the oxyl-radical ligand of [POM-CuII O ]5−. Furthermore, the SET-WNA process is characterized by two-state reactivity and the observed spin inversions between two potential energy surfaces effectively reduce the activation barrier. Therefore, the present work would provide the promising information for further designing water oxidation catalysts (WOCs).",
