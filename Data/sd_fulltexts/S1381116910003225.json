Graphical abstract A new type of copolymer microspheres immobilized porphyrinatomanganese(III) was prepared and used to catalyze cyclohexene epoxidation in the presence of molecular oxygen and isobutylaldehyde. On the basis of synthesis of styrene–hydroxyethyl methacrylate copolymer microspheres with a functionalized hydroxyl, we have prepared a new type of copolymer microspheres immobilized porphyrinatomanganese(III), P(St-co-HEMA)MnP, by a condensation reaction between a hydroxyl in copolymer microspheres surface and a carboxyl in porphyrin ring. The obtained copolymer catalyst (P(St-co-HMEA)MnP) was characterized by SEM, UV–vis, IR, ICP and TG–DTG. The SEM image shows that the morphology of the copolymer catalyst is spheriform with ca. 4μm diameter. The catalytic activity of P(St-co-HMEA)MnP to epoxidize cyclohexene in the presence of molecular oxygen and isobutylaldehyde has been studied. The catalytic efficiency of P(St-co-HMEA)MnP is comparable to that of non-supported MnCMPTTP. It is a mild, reusable and highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the epoxidation of cyclohexene. Keywords Copolymer microspheres Porphyrinatomanganese(III) Epoxidation Cyclohexene 1 Introduction Over the past few decades, several reports on metalloporphyrins as catalysts for epoxidation of olefins have appeared [1–5]. A variety of oxidants, such as PhIO [6], H2O2 [7], MMPP (magnesium monoperoxyphthalate) [8], TBAO (tetrabutylammonium monosulfate) [9], n-Bu4NIO4 (tetrabutylammonium periodate) [10] and molecular oxygen [11,12], in combination with different metalloporphyrin catalysts have been employed as oxygen atom donors. However, solid-supported metalloporphyrins are attracting more interests because of their increased stability, easy recovery from reaction media and recycling, as discussed recently in some reviews [13–17]. Among the supports that can be used to immobilize metalloporphyrins, polystyrene derivatives are often employed for their cheapness, ready availability, mechanical robustness, chemical inertness and facile functionalization. And there are several reports dealing with polystyrene derivatives bearing metalloporphyrins for epoxidation of olefins [16–27]. However, there are few reports about the epoxidation of olefins using polystyrene derivatives supported metalloporphyrins as catalysts and molecular oxygen as oxidant [28]. We have investigated epoxidation of alkenes catalyzed by very small amount of Mn(TPP)Cl with dioxygen [12,29]. This catalyst proved to be an effective catalyst in epoxidation systems with extremely high turnover number in the presence of molecular oxygen and isobutylaldehyde, which is comparable to most enzyme catalysis. On the bases of the preparation of several polystyrene-based supports immobilizing metalloporphyrins and the researches for their catalysis in hydrocarbon hydroxylation with molecular oxygen [30–34], in this work, a new polystyrene-based support, namely styrene–hydroxyethyl methacrylate copolymer microspheres with hydroxy groups on the surface, was prepared and Mn(III) complex of 5-(4-(carboxymethoxy)phenyl)-10,15,20-tri(p-tolyl) porphyrin was immobilized on it. The catalytic activity of this supported porphyrinatomanganese(III) to catalyze epoxidation of cyclohexene with oxygen molecules in the presence of reducing agent has been investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials 5-(4-(Hydroxyl)phenyl)-10,15,20-tri(p-tolyl) porphyrin (HPTTP) was synthesized in our laboratory [35]. Styrene (St) was washed with 5% NaOH several times to remove inhibitor and then distilled under reduced pressure. 2-Hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) supplied from Alfa Aesar was purified by passing through active alumina. 2,2′-Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) was recrystallized from methanol. Other reagents were commercially available and used without further purification. 2.2 Physical measurements Elemental analysis (C, H and N) was carried out on a PerkinElmer 240 Q elemental analyzer. ESI-MS was measured on a Thermo Finnigan LCQ DECA XP spectrometer. UV–vis and IR spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3150 spectrophotometer and an Equinox 55 Fourier transformation infra-red spectrometer, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyze was performed with a JSM-6330F field emission scanning electron microscope. An Iris (HR) inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-atomic emission spectrometer was used to determine the content of porphyrinatomanganese(III). Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Accelerated Surface Area and Porosimetry Analyzer was used to determine the surface area. Thermal analysis was performed with a Netzsch TG-209 thermogravimetric analyzer. 2.3 Preparation of styrene–hydroxyethyl methacrylate copolymer microspheres immobilized porphyrinatomanganese(III) The strategy to prepare styrene–hydroxyethyl methacrylate copolymer microspheres immobilized porphyrinatomanganese(III) is shown in Scheme 1 . On the basis of synthesis of Mn(III) porphyrin with a functionalized carboxyl and styrene–hydroxyethyl methacrylate copolymer microspheres with a functionalized hydroxyl, Mn(III) porphyrin is immobilized to copolymer microspheres by a condensation reaction between a carboxyl in porphyrin ring and a hydroxyl in copolymer microsphere surface. 2.3.1 Synthesis of 5-(4-(carboxymethoxy)phenyl)-10,15,20-tri(p-tolyl) porphyrin (CMPTTP) A mixture of 0.3091g HPTTP, 1.8gK2CO3 and 50ml DMF was stirred at 100°C. 2ml ethyl bromoacetate dissolved in 5ml DMF was added dropwise. After 9h, the mixture was washed with H2O several times. After washing to neutrality with H2O, it is concentrated via rotary evaporation. Then the crude product was dissolved in 15ml CHCl3, and 15ml 10% KOH was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred for 0.5h at room temperature. The mixture was washed with H2O several times. After washing to neutrality with H2O, drying over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrating via rotary evaporation, the residue was chromatographed on a silica gel column using CHCl3 as eluent. Evaporation of solvent afforded CMPTTP. Yield: 0.3021g (90.1%) (Found: C, 78.61; H, 5.41; N, 7.45%. Calc. for C49H38N4O3·H2O: C, 78.59; H, 5.38; N, 7.48%). ESI-MS [CHCl3, m/z]: 731 ([CMPTTP]+). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300MHz): δ −2.46 (s, 2H, pyrrole N–H), 2.66 (s, 9H, phenyl CH3) 4.90 (s, 2H, –O–CH2–CO), 7.25–7.55 (8H, phenyl m-H), 7.95–8.16 (8H phenyl o-H), 8.60–8.77 (s, 8H, pyrrole C–H). 2.3.2 Synthesis of 5-(4-(carboxymethoxy)phenyl)-10,15,20-tri(p-tolyl) porphyrin Mn(III) (MnCMPTTP) 0.5g Mn(Ac)2 and 1g NaCl dissolved in 40ml HAc were mixed with 20ml CHCl3 solution of CMPTTP (0.2990g). The mixture was stirred at 65°C for 8h. Then, the reaction mixture was washed with H2O several times. After washing to neutrality with H2O, drying over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrating via rotary evaporation, the residue was chromatographed on a silica gel column using CHCl3 as eluent. Evaporation of solvent afforded MnCMPTTP as a green powder. Yield: 0.3202g (95.6%) (Found: C, 70.27; H, 4.60; N, 6.72%. Calc. for C49H36N4O3MnCl·H2O: C, 70.29; H, 4.57; N, 6.69%). ESI-MS [CHCl3, m/z]: 783 ([MnCMPTTP]+). 2.3.3 Synthesis of styrene–hydroxyethyl methacrylate copolymer microspheres P(St-co-HEMA) Styrene–hydroxyethyl methacrylate copolymer microspheres, P(St-co-HEMA), were synthesized by dispersion copolymerization in a ethanol–water media using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a dispersant and 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as an initiator [33,34]. A total of 14.0ml styrene, 2.0ml HEMA, 0.5ml divinylbenzene (DVB), 0.5g polyvinylpyrrolidone (K-30) (PVP K-30), 0.12g AIBN, 95mlC2H5OH and 5ml H2O were mixed in a 250ml three-neck reaction flask equipped with an anchor-shaped stirrer and a condenser. After stirring at 400rpm, the mixtures were heated to 70°C for 12h under a N2 atmosphere. After completion of the polymerization period, the reactor content was cooled down to room temperature and centrifuged at 5000rpm for 10min for the removal of dispersion medium. The microspheres were redispersed within 30ml of ethanol and centrifuged again under similar condition. The ethanol washing was repeated three times for complete removal of unconverted monomers and other components. The final product was dried for 24h at 60°C in vacuum. 2.3.4 Preparation of styrene–hydroxyethyl methacrylate copolymer microspheres immobilized MnCMPTTP (P(St-co-HEMA)MnP) 0.05g MnCMPTTP was suspended in thionyl chloride (20ml) and the mixture was refluxed for 7h, after which the excess of thionyl chloride was distilled off. The residue was dissolved in 30ml 1,2-dichloroethane. 3g P(St-co-HEMA) and several drops of pyridine were added. The suspension was stirred at 80°C for 12h, after which the crude product was obtained. The polymer particles were filtered off and washed with 1,2-dichloroethane, acetone and ethanol respectively. The final product was dried for 24h at 60°C in vacuum. 2.4 Epoxidation of cyclohexene The epoxidation of cyclohexene using P(St-co-HEMA)MnP was carried out in a specially constructed reaction vessel at room temperature [12]. The catalytic system consisted of P(St-co-HEMA)MnP, substrate (2mmol cyclohexene), 6mmol isobutylaldehyde and 10ml acetone. Dioxygen was bubbled through the solution. The products were detected and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-7890II) and bromobenzene was used as internal standard. P(St-co-HEMA)MnP was recovered from the catalytic system by centrifugal separation after reaction for 4h and then reused under identical conditions. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of P(St-co-HEMA)MnP The morphologies of P(St-co-HEMA) and P(St-co-HEMA)MnP were obtained by SEM as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). The SEM images of P(St-co-HEMA) and P(St-co-HEMA)MnP show smooth surfaces and spherical morphologies with an average diameter of ca. 4μm. The presence of MnCMPTTP in the copolymer can be confirmed by the solid state UV–vis spectrum. Typical absorption spectrum of MnCMPTTP with Soret band centred at ca. 490nm, was observed in the solid state UV–vis spectrum of P(St-co-HEMA)MnP (Fig. 2 ). Comparing the spectrum with that of the corresponding non-supported MnCMPTTP, the Soret band is red-shifted by about 15nm (Fig. 2, insert). Red-shifted of Soret band usually can be observed when metalloporphyrins are immobilized on solid supports, which can be attributed to the distortion of the porphyrin rings [36–39]. IR spectra of P(St-co-HEMA) and P(St-co-HEMA)MnP are very similar to each other. Characteristic bands of styrene and hydroxyethyl methacrylate are shown in the IR spectra of P(St-co-HEMA) and P(St-co-HEMA)MnP. For example, four peaks at 1600, 1583, 1493 and 1452cm−1, and double peaks at 758 and 700cm−1 are clearly observed and can be attributed to the benzene rings in styrene. Two bands at 1182 and 1726cm−1 are also clearly observed and can be attributed to the ester group in hydroxyethyl methacrylate. A broad band in the region of 3450–3550cm−1 attributed to the hydroxy group in styrene–hydroxyethyl methacrylate copolymer is observed in the IR spectrum of P(St-co-HEMA). As we had expected, same band is also observed in the IR spectrum of P(St-co-HEMA)MnP, which is due to only part of the hydroxy group in styrene–hydroxyethyl methacrylate copolymer reacting with functionalized carboxyl in Mn(III) porphyrin. The MnCMPTTP content of the catalyst was determined by the method reported in the literature [32–34] and the porphyrinatomanganese(III) content of P(St-co-HEMA)MnP was 0.39%. The surface area of P(St-co-HEMA)MnP has been determined by BET surface area measurement, which is approximately 5.3m2/g. Thermostability of P(St-co-HEMA)MnP has been determined by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TG–DTG curves of P(St-co-HEMA)MnP are shown in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that P(St-co-HEMA)MnP degrades at 312°C. This demonstrates that the catalyst is thermally stable up to almost 310°C. And when the temperature rises at 545°C, the organic parts of P(St-co-HEMA)MnP decompose completely. 3.2 Catalysis of P(St-co-HEMA)MnP for cyclohexene epoxidation The epoxidation of cyclohexene catalyzed by P(St-co-HEMA)MnP was investigated in catalyst–O2–isobutyraldehyde system. It is found that the main product was 1,2-epoxycyclohexane. Since isobutyraldehyde concentration has a great influence on epoxide yield [40], the epoxidation with various molar ratios of isobutyraldehyde to substrate was examined in P(St-co-HEMA)MnP–O2–isobutyraldehyde system. The results are shown in Table 1 . It displayed that when isobutyraldehyde was absent, the epoxidation of cyclohexene was not observed. When the molar ratio of isobutyraldehyde and substrate was 3mol/mol, the highest value of epoxide yield was obtained, and the increase of isobutyraldehyde concentration cannot increase the epoxide yield considerably. So, the isobutyraldehyde/substrate molar ratio as 3mol/mol is used in catalytic experiments. The relationship between the yield of 1,2-epoxycyclohexane and reaction time in the epoxidation of cyclohexene catalyzed by P(St-co-HEMA)MnP is shown in Fig. 4 . It can be seen that the yield of 1,2-epoxycyclohexane was enhanced rapidly after about 1h, and reached maximum value after about 4h. The yield of 1,2-epoxycyclohexane is almost unchanged with a further increase in the reaction time. The results suggest that 4h may be the optimum reaction time in this experiment system. The results of cyclohexene epoxidation catalyzed by P(St-co-HEMA)MnP (fresh and recovered) and non-supported MnCMPTTP are summarized in Table 2 . Controlled experiment using P(St-co-HEMA) as catalyst was carried out and only 12% cyclohexene could be converted, indicating that the metalloporphyrin is crucial for the epoxidation. From Table 2, we can find that the yield of cyclohexene epoxide catalyzed by P(St-co-HEMA)MnP is 93.3% and TON of P(St-co-HEMA)MnP is 24,049 in the presence of molecular oxygen and isobutylaldehyde after 4h. It is obvious that P(St-co-HEMA)MnP is a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the epoxidation of cyclohexene and its catalytic activity is comparable to that of non-supported MnCMPTTP. It is notable that P(St-co-HEMA)MnP can be completely recovered and effectively reused. After the epoxidation of cyclohexene, P(St-co-HEMA)MnP was recycled by simple filtration and subsequent washing of the solid remnants with acetone. A fresh solution of substrate was then introduced to the catalytic material, and the catalyzed reaction was restarted. As shown in Table 2, P(St-co-HEMA)MnP retains its high yield of cyclohexene epoxide and high turnover numbers after being reused four times. All reaction solutions analyzed after catalytic reactions did not show the characteristic Soret band of MnCMPTTP, which demonstrated that no MnCMPTTP was leaching into the reaction solution. Thus, our results reveal the stable catalytic capability of this catalyst as well as the success of this new synthetic route. 4 Conclusion On the basis of synthesis of styrene–hydroxyethyl methacrylate copolymer microspheres with a functionalized hydroxyl and Mn(III) porphyrin with a functionalized carboxyl, we have prepared a new type of copolymer microspheres immobilized porphyrinatomanganese(III), P(St-co-HEMA)MnP, by a condensation reaction between a carboxyl in porphyrin ring and a hydroxyl in copolymer microsphere surface. The copolymer microspheres have smooth surface and spherical morphology with ca. 4μm diameter. The catalysis of P(St-co-HEMA)MnP to epoxide cyclohexene in the presence of molecular oxygen and isobutylaldehyde have been investigated in the presence of molecular oxygen and isobutylaldehyde. It is found that P(St-co-HEMA)MnP has high catalytic activity, to be comparable to that of non-supported MnCMPTTP, and retains its high catalytic activity after being reused four times. It seems that P(St-co-HEMA)MnP is a mild, reusable and highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the epoxidation of cyclohexene.
