Campus U.A.M., Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain Received 24 June 1996; revised 7 August 1996; accepted 7 August 1996 Abstract Three activated carbons were prepared with different content of oxygen surface complexes and impregnated with aqueous solutions of [Pt(NH3)4]C12. The catalysts were characterized by H~ and CO chemisorption at room temperature, temperature-programmed decomposition (TPD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and their catalytic behavior in the vapor phase hydrogenations of benzene and crotonaldehyde (trans-2-butenal) was determined. Metal dispersion is highly dependent on the degree of support oxidation, being lower for the catalyst support containing the highest amount of surface acidic complexes. This is attributed to the decomposition of the surface complexes, which act as anchoring centers for the platinum precursor, upon the reduction treatments at which the catalysts are subjected. The specific catalytic activity in the gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde is higher as the starting support is more oxidized, and the activity per gram of platinum increases with reduction temperature. The selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonilic C=O bond instead of the olefinic C=C bond is also improved when an oxidized support is used, and the production of the unsaturated alcohol, crotyl alcohol, is enhanced when catalysts are reduced at higher temperature, especially those prepared with oxidized supports.

Coloma et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 165-183 1. Introduction Unsaturated alcohols form a very important group of compounds for the chemical industry, especially for the synthesis of fine chemicals. The catalytic hydrogenation of a,/3-unsaturated aldehydes to produce unsaturated alcohols is not easy, given that the olefinic double bond is preferentially reduced, both by kinetic and thermodynamic considerations, and the yield of unsaturated alcohol is usually low. Monometallic platinum catalysts usually hydrogenate the C=C bond with a 100% selectivity and it is necessary to promote the metal to obtain a certain selectivity towards the desired unsaturated alcohol. Support effects [1-3] and addition of other metals such as tin [4-7], iron [7,8] and nickel [9] have been claimed to improve the selectivity of platinum catalysts towards the hydrogena- tion of the carbonyl bond. An important enhancement of selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohols has been reported by using supports with SMSI (Strong Metal Support Interaction) properties in the selective hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond in crotonaldehyde (trans-2-butenal) and acrolein (2-propenal) [2,10-13], with both platinum and other metals such as Ru [14,15] and Ir [16,17]. In this way, Vannice et al. [2], working with Pt/TiO2 catalysts in the vapor phase hydrogenation of crotonalde- hyde, obtained crotyl alcohol with selectivities as high as 37% when the reduction treatment was carried out at high temperature. Although the metal dispersion deeply decreased, the turnover frequencies for the reaction were high. Hong-Van et al. supported platinum on MoO3 and WO3 [10]. A strong metal- support interaction is produced by reducing at high temperatures in a way that the catalytic activity and the selectivity for the unsaturated alcohol were greatly improved. The use of zeolites as supports for metal catalysts also produces a certain selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol, mainly when the a,/3-un- saturated aldehydes to be hydrogenated have bulky groups close to the olefinic bond, which cause steric hindrance to the chemisorption through it [3]. Monometallic Pt/C catalysts have been mainly studied, with interesting results, in the liquid phase hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (trans-3-phenyl- 2-propenal) and methyl-crotonaldehyde. Gallezot et al. find a strong dependence of selectivity on the metal particle size in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde [ 18]; they claim that the chemisorption of the aldehyde through the C =C bond is hindered by a repulsive effect between the flat metal surface in the large particles and the phenolic ring, thus favoring the preferential hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond. The same authors find that the metal-support interaction in graphite-supported platinum catalysts enhances the selectivity towards the pro- duction of cinnamyl alcohol [19,20], as a consequence of the increase of electronic density on platinum particles by a donor effect of the graphite crystallites that would decrease the ability of platinum to hydrogenate the C=C bond. This paper reports the beneficial effect of oxygen surface groups on the F. Coloma et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 165-183 167 support in the gas-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol on activated carbon-supported monometallic platinum catalysts, using tetramine platinum (II) chloride as metal precursor. Early results of this study have been previously reported in a short paper [21]. 2. Experimental 2.1. Supports The parent support (AC) was an activated carbon, with a mean particle size of 0.85 mm, prepared from olive stones by carbonization in flowing nitrogen (2 h, 1123 K) and further activation with steam (100 cm3 min-l, 3 h, 1223 K). After hydrochloric acid washing, this activated carbon had an ash content lower than 0.1 wt%. Carbon AC was subjected to an oxidation treatment with H202 in order to create oxygen surface groups. The sample was immersed into an aqueous solution of H202 (12 mol l-t), and the slurry so formed was stirred for 48 h at room temperature. Finally, the oxidized carbon (hereafter called ACox) was washed with de-ionized water to eliminate the excess of H202 and dried in air at 373 K. One more support (ACoxT) was obtained by heat treatment of ACox in flowing nitrogen at 773 K for 2 h in such a way that the less stable oxygen surface groups are decomposed and removed. The characterization of the porous texture of the activated carbons was carried out by physical adsorp- tion of nitrogen at 77 K and carbon dioxide at 273 K in a fully automated adsorption system (Autosorb 6, from Quantachrome). In a previous step, sam- ples were degassified under vacuum at 423 K for 6 h. The determination of the amount and thermal stability of the oxygen surface groups on the supports was accomplished by temperature-programmed decom- position (TPD) in helium. Samples (about 100 mg) were placed in a U-shaped quartz cell and treated at 373 K for 1 h in flowing helium (60 cm3 min-~). Then, the temperature was raised at 10 K min-l to 1250 K. Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide evolving as decomposition products of the oxygen surface complexes were measured with a mass spectrometer. The amounts evolved have been calculated by using calcium oxalate and calcium carbonate as calibration standards. 2.2. Catalysts Catalysts were prepared by impregnation of supports with basic (pH = 9.5) aqueous solutions (10 cm3/g of support) of [Pt(NH 3)4]C12, with the appropriate concentration to achieve a metal content of about 1 wt.-%. The pH of the solutions was adjusted by adding some drops of aqueous concentrated NH3 solution. After the adsorption equilibrium was reached (the time needed was 168 F. Coloma et aL / Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 165-183 assessed by previous adsorption kinetic measurements), the excess solvent was removed by flowing nitrogen through the slurry, and the remaining solid was dried overnight at 393 K and then kept in a desiccator until use. The platinum content was measured by burning away the carbon in air at 973 K and analyzing by UV spectrophotometry (wavelength = 261.8 nm) the residue dissolved in aqua regia. Before characterization and activity measurements, catalysts were subjected to an in situ pretreatment including the decomposition of the supported metal precursor in helium (2 h, 673 K) and the subsequent reduction in hydrogen. This two-stage treatment assures a better metal dispersion in catalysts prepared from [Pt(NH3)4]C12 than decomposition-reduction in hydrogen, as reported previ- ously [22]. The number of Pt surface atoms on the catalysts was determined by hydrogen and carbon monoxide chemisorption at 298 K in a volumetric system, following the conventional procedure previously described elsewhere [23]. Chemisorption on supports was found to be nil in all cases, as measured under the same experimental conditions. Hydrogen uptakes were used to determine the metal dispersion, D, by assuming that one hydrogen atom is chemisorbed on one surface platinum atom. Photoelectron spectra were obtained with a Fisons ESCALAB MklI 200R spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electron analyzer and a Mg K a 120 W X-ray source. A PDP 11/04 computer from Digital Equipment was used for collecting and analyzing the spectra. Fresh samples were mounted onto a manipulator which allowed the transfer from the preparation chamber into the analysis chamber. The decomposition-reduction treatment was carried out in situ. The binding energy (BE) of the C ls peak of the support at 284.9 eV was taken as an internal standard. The accuracy of the BE values is + 0.2 eV. Peaks intensities were estimated by calculating the integral of each peak after subtrac- tion of the S-shaped background and fitting the experimental peak to a Lorentzian/Gaussian mix of variable proportion. Benzene hydrogenation and crotonaldehyde hydrogenation were both carried out in the vapor phase at atmospheric pressure, using a dynamic flow microreac- tor equipped with an automatic on-line analysis system. Benzene hydrogenation, studied at 323 K, was performed with a reaction mixture containing purified hydrogen and benzene (Merck, reagent grade) in a H2:benzene ratio of 11.0. The crotonaldehyde hydrogenation was carried out at temperatures ranging from 313 to 373 K. The reduced catalysts were contacted with a reaction mixture (flow of 50 cm3 min-l) formed with purified hydrogen and crotonaldehyde (> 99.5% purity, Fluka) which was prepared by passing a hydrogen flow through a thermostabilized saturator (293 K) containing the unsaturated alde- hyde. Activity and selectivity data were collected after 90 min on stream, when the steady state conditions were reached after the initial deactivation within the first 20 min. Then, the temperature was raised and a new set of data was obtained after 90 min on stream at the new reaction temperature. This process F. Coloma et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 165-183 169 was repeated to obtain activity data at four different temperatures. The concen- tration of reactants and products at the outlet of the reactor was determined by on-line gas chromatography with a Carbowax 20 M 58/90 semicapillar column. 3. Results and discussion 3. I. Support characterization Table 1 reports the BET surface areas and micropore volumes [Dubinin- Radushkevich (D-R) equation] of supports AC, ACox and ACoxT, calculated from N2 adsorption (77 K) data, as well as the micropore volumes obtained from carbon dioxide adsorption at 273 K (D-R equation), which measures only the narrower microporosity ( < 0.7 nm) [24]. It can be concluded from these data that the mild oxidation treatment carried out with hydrogen peroxide has a very little impact (if any) on the textural characteristics of the parent support. On the other hand, the thermal treatment carried out to destroy the less stable surface complexes does produce a small carbon gasification; this is the origin of the somewhat higher BET surface area of carbon ACoxT. The fact that only modification of the micropore volume measured by nitrogen adsorption is observed after the heat treatment, and the narrowest microporosity (measured by CO2 adsorption) remains unchanged, points to the presence of the oxygen surface groups in the widest microporosity of the activated carbon. The oxygen surface groups of the supports were characterized by tempera- ture-programmed decomposition in flowing helium. It is well known that these surface groups decompose upon heating in an inert atmosphere, the most acidic evolving as CO2 and the less acidic evolving as CO. This technique is widely used for the characterization of oxygen surface complexes in carbons [25-27], resulting, in some cases, in a more comprehensive method than selective titration. The temperature-programmed CO and CO2 desorption profiles ob- tained with carbons AC, ACox and ACo~T are compared in Fig. la and Fig. lb. By integration of the curves, the amounts of CO2 and CO evolved have been calculated. Such values are listed in Table 2. The parent support, AC, contains a certain amount of oxygen surface complexes, formed during the process of activation with steam.

The comparison of the TPD profiles of supports AC and ACox shows the effect of the modification of the carbon's surface chemistry by the oxidation treatment. Hydrogen peroxide creates a high amount of surface oxygen complexes, both those evolving as CO2 and CO. Furthermore, CO2 evolution is now observed also at higher tempera- tures. The TPD profile of support ACoxT shows no desorption peaks below 773 K, the temperature at which it has been pre-treated. The CO2 evolution profile presents here a peak at about 1050 K, which corresponds to the decomposition of relatively stable acidic groups. Although there is a certain CO2 desorption from carbon ACox at these high temperatures, the transformation of some carboxylic groups into anhydride groups during the thermal treatment at 773 K should not be ruled out. These would account for the somewhat higher amount of CO2 evolving at these temperatures from carbon ACoxT, as the anhydride groups are more stable that the carboxylic ones [28]. 3.2. Catalyst characterization 3.2.1.112 and CO chemisorption Three catalysts have been prepared by ion-exchange of the square planar complex [Pt(NH3)4]2+, in ammoniacal aqueous solution, with the acidic oxygen surface groups of the supports. These groups will be dissociated into the anionic form and H at the high pH of the solution; thus, the adsorption of the cationic platinum precursor will be favored. The amount of platinum loaded is 1 wt% for all the three samples; it corresponds to about 50 ~xmol g-~, a value which is much lower than the amount of acidic surface species on the supports, even in the unoxidized sample (AC), as can be deduced from values in Table 2. The CO and CO2 TPD profiles obtained with the freshly prepared catalysts are similar to those in Fig. 1 corresponding to the respective supports. This F.

Similar results have been found by Romfin-Martlnez et al. [29]. Table 3 reports the capacity of the catalysts for H2 and CO chemisorption at room temperature, after a pretreatment which included the metal precursor decomposition at 673 K in He for 2 h and further reduction in H2 at 623 K for 12 h. The platinum dispersion has been calculated from hydrogen chemisorp- Table 3 Chemisorption properties of catalysts, after reduction at 623 K for 12 h Catalyst HChem' (l~mol g- t ) COchem\" (Ixmol g- 1 ) D (H/Pt) d (nm) Pt/AC 12.4 12.4 0.24 5 Pt/ACoxT 10.2 9.1 0.20 5 Pt/ACox 4.4 2.4 0.09 12 172 F.

The dispersion values obtained are also presented in Table 3. It can be seen that the platinum dispersion differs from one catalyst to another. The catalyst with the untreated support (Pt/AC) shows the highest platinum dispersion which, in fact, is relatively low; furthermore, the amount of chemisorbed hydrogen coincides with that of chemisorbed carbon monoxide. The catalyst with the oxidized support (Pt/ACox) shows the lowest dispersion, less than a half than Pt/AC. It should also be noted that CO chemisorption is greatly decreased with respect to H2 chemisorption (HChem.:COchem.-----1.8). Finally, platinum in catalyst Pt/ACoxT is slightly less dispersed than in Pt/AC, showing also a Hchem.'.COchem\" ratio, 1.1, which is closer to the unity value obtained with the Pt/AC catalyst. The oxidative treatment of a carbon with aqueous solutions of oxidizer reagents (H202, HNO3, HC10, ... ) mainly creates oxygen surface complexes that decrease the isoelectric point (IEP) of the carbon. In this way, the adsorption of a cationic species such as [Pt(NH3)4]2+ should be favored in basic media, leading to a high metal dispersion. The creation of such acidic groups on supports AC, ACox and ACoxT has been monitored by temperature-pro- grammed desorption experiments, and a clear inverse relation between platinum dispersion and the amount of acidic groups on the support can be envisaged. The deposition of the metallic precursor is carried out at a high pH value, 9.5. Under these conditions, the acidic groups on the carbon surface will be dissociated, facing a negative charge to the solution which favors the adsorption of cationic species such as [Pt(NH3)4]2+. In this sense, these groups can be considered as anchoring centers for the platinum precursor and its presence should favor higher dispersions. However, it is necessary to bear in mind that the thermal stability of the acidic complexes is relatively low, and they are decomposed upon the thermal treatment at which the catalysts are subjected for activation. This will favor the mobility of platinum species, and, consequently, lower degrees of dispersion -- mainly if the anchoring centers are located at the entrance of the wide micropores of the carbon -- as seems to be the case in these catalysts. Similar results have been obtained in a previous study with oxidized carbon blacks as supports [23], and it was observed by XPS measure- ments that a better initial platinum dispersion was achieved with the oxidized support after impregnation, but it was lost upon the thermal treatment carried out to reduce the platinum precursor. 3.2.2. Effect of the reduction treatments Fig. 2 shows the evolution of the XPS (Ipt:IC) intensity ratios for the different catalysts with the reduction temperature that can be considered as an estimation of the platinum dispersion. Fresh samples (dried at 393 K after preparation) were subjected to a high vacuum in situ treatment at 298 K before analysis. Two different behaviors can be observed from Fig. 2. On one side, the amount of F.

Evolution of platinum dispersion with the reduction temperature, as measured by the lr~ :Ic XPS ratio. surface platinum increases after reduction at 523 K with respect to the fresh samples in catalysts Pt/AC and Pt/ACo; for higher reduction temperatures, sintering is produced to different extents, leading to lower Ipt:Ic ratios. On the other hand, the amount of surface platinum species continuously decreases with the increase in the reduction temperature for catalyst Pt/ACox. It is important to remark that the intensity ratio for this latter sample after reduction at 623 K is much lower than those obtained with the other two counterparts, which agrees with the tendencies observed in the metal dispersion obtained from H2 and CO chemisorption. Moreover, the different Iet:Ic ratios obtained with the fresh samples seems to be originated by the drying treatment at which the catalysts are subjected after ion-exchange, given that the platinum content is similar in all of them (1.0 wt%). The oxygen surface groups on the support have a high influence during the catalyst preparation step, favoring the wettability of the hydrophobic carbon and even acting as anchoring centers for the metal precursor. However, some of those groups have a limited thermal stability at temperatures at which the catalyst is treated for achieving the reduction of the metal precursor (up to 723 K in our case). The decomposition of the less stable surface complexes could affect the final dispersion of the metal phase and also its catalytic behavior. The effect of reduction treatments at several temperatures on the oxygen surface groups of catalyst Pt/ACox has been monitored by TPD. Fig. 3 presents the TPD profiles of CO and CO2 evolution obtained with the Pt/ACox catalyst both in the fresh state and after reduction in flowing hydrogen at 623 K and at 723 K. Two main conclusions can be drawn from Fig. 3. First, the CO2-evolving groups are practically decomposed (reduced) after the treatment in hydrogen at 623 K, even those which are thermally stable up to higher temperatures than the 174 F.

Secondly, a very important amount of CO-evolving complexes are also reduced, to a larger extent at higher temperatures (723 K). Fig. 4 shows the evolution of the XPS Io:Ic intensity ratios for the different catalysts as a function of the reduction temperature in H2. For the freshly prepared catalysts, the highest intensity ratio corresponds to Pt/ACox, as could be expected from the genesis of this sample. The reduction treatment at 523 K causes a deep decrease in the amount of oxygen detected in this sample, and this could be attributed to the loss of an important part of CO2-evolving groups. The loss of surface oxygen species continues as the reduction temperature increases up to 723 K.

Evolution of the amount of superficial oxygen on the catalysts as measured by the Io:Ic XPS ratio. F. Coloma et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 165-183 175 increase in the reduction temperature produces a lower amount of oxygen surface groups, the diminution being less important for catalyst Pt/AC. The decomposition of the oxygen surface groups upon the reduction treatment in hydrogen creates active sites which are able to chemisorb hydrogen. This is a proposed step in the carbon gasification reaction with hydrogen to form methane; in this way, hydrogen would chemisorb on the active sites forming -CH2 species in a first step and then -CH4 species, that would desorb as CH4 and liberate the active center to continue the reaction [30]. Hydrogen chemisorption on the support, as described previously, could be favored by the presence of a metal, such as platinum, which is able to dissociate the H2 molecule upon chemisorption. In this way, chemisorbed hydrogen atoms could spread to the active sites on the support by a spillover mechanism [29,31 ]. In order to analyze the occurrence of the process on the catalyst under study, the thermal desorption of hydrogen chemisorbed upon the reduction treatment has been followed. Thus, fresh samples were subjected to a previous thermal treatment in flowing helium (2 h, 673 K) and then reduced with flowing pure hydrogen at two different temperatures (623 and 723 K) for two hours. They were allowed to cool under hydrogen flow and, once at room temperature, the flowing gas was switched to helium and, when no hydrogen was detected, the TPD experiment was initiated. The hydrogen thermal desorption profiles ob- tained with catalysts whose supports contained the lowest and the highest amount of oxygen surface groups (Pt/AC and Pt/ACo are plotted in Fig. 5a (the whole profile) and Fig. 5b (only the low temperature desorption peaks). The TPD profile obtained after reduction of the parent support AC at 623 K is also included in Fig. 5a. The low metal content in these catalysts and its low dispersion made it impossible to detect, under the conditions used, the desorption of hydrogen chemisorbed on the metal surface. The TPD profile of activated carbon AC after reduction at 623 K (Fig. 5a) shows that hydrogen desorption starts at about 1125 K, with a maximum desorption rate at about 1325 K. The hydrogen desorbed is assigned to carbon functionalities, since it is also observed in TPD experiments carried out with activated carbon without prior reduction treatments [32]. Besides this high temperature hydrogen evolution in higher or lower extension, catalysts also show a lower temperature desorption peak, which is centered at about 757 K for catalysts reduced at 623 K, and at 800 K when catalysts are reduced at 723 K. The fact that this peak does not appear in the parent support clearly relates it to the presence of platinum. Thus, it is postulated that hydrogen dissociatively chemisorbs onto the platinum surface atoms and then spills over the support, where it could react with the active centers created upon the decomposition of oxygen surface groups. The clear relationship between the amount of hydrogen desorbed at this low temperatures (Table 4) and the degree of oxidation of the support (i.e., the amount of oxygen surface groups) corrob- orates the proposed explanation. Furthermore, the desorption peaks are shifted to 176 F.

Coloma et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 165-183 177 The characteristics and properties of this hydrogen species are currently being studied in our laboratory. At this stage, their existence can provide an explana- tion for the unique catalytic behavior observed with platinum supported on oxidized carbon, as discussed in the next section. 3.3. Catalytic behavior 3.3.1. Benzene hydrogenation Benzene hydrogenation has been carried out in order to assess the decrease of platinum dispersion with the oxidation degree of supports obtained by chemisorption measurements, given the structure-insensitive character of this reaction on platinum catalysts. The specific activities obtained after two hours on stream at 323 K have been 150, 155 and 65 h-1 for catalysts Pt/AC, Pt/ACoxT and Pt/ACox, respectively, after reduction at 623 K. These values have been calculated on the basis of the amount of surface platinum atoms deduced by hydrogen chemisorption. As can be seen, the specific activity of catalyst Pt/Acox is much lower than that of the other two catalysts, which show a similar behavior. A tentative explanation for this behavior is the overestimation of the particle size in Pt/ACox as obtained by hydrogen chemisorption. It is reported in Table 3 that the Hchem./COchem\" ratio is 1.8 for Pt/ACo~, but 1.1 and 1.0 for Pt/ACoxT and Pt/AC, respectively. If one assumes an adsorption stoichiometry one CO molecule per surface platinum atom, these results indicate that there is an excess of chemisorbed hydrogen. In this way, platinum crystallites would be larger than 12 nm in Pt/ACox, accounting for its observed low specific activity in benzene hydrogenation. As shown above, the active centers created on the carbon surface by the decomposition-reduction of the oxygen surface groups upon the reduction treatment in hydrogen, are able to chemisorb hydrogen previously dissociated on the platinum surface, and this hydrogen is evolved by heating at 650-850 K in flowing helium. After the reduction treatment prior to the chemisorption mea- surements, the samples are outgassed at the reduction temperature (623 or 723 K) under high vacuum. This treatment is likely to eliminate an important amount of hydrogen adsorbed on the support, and would liberate active centers that could receive hydrogen atoms spilt from the platinum surface during the H2 chemisorption determination. Thus, the platinum dispersion would be overesti- mated. The fact that H2 chemisorption is carried out at room temperature explains the relatively lesser extent of the spillover phenomena under these conditions, as compared to that observed during the reduction treatments, which takes place at much higher temperatures. 3.3.2. Crotonaldehyde hydrogenation Fig. 6 shows the turnover frequencies (molecules of crotonaldehyde trans- formed per surface platinum atom per hour) obtained with catalysts Pt/AC, 178 F.

Turnover numbers (h- l ) for catalysts in the vapor phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde at different temperatures. Reduction temperature: 623 K. Pt/ACoxT and Pt/ACox at different reaction temperatures in Arrhenius coordi- nates. Firstly, it is to remark the higher slope obtained with catalyst Pt/AC, which corresponds to a higher apparent activation energy for the overall reaction (34 kJ mo1-1 for Pt/AC versus 24 and 22 kJ mo1-1 for Pt/ACoxT and Pt/ACox, respectively). The high specific activity of Pt/ACox, which would be still higher if, as considered previously, its metal particle size is overestimated by hydrogen chemisorption, can be attributed to the structure-sensitive character of the reaction, in such a way that it could be favored in larger platinum particles. However, the metal dispersion in catalysts Pt/AC and Pt/ACo~T are rather similar but Pt/ACoxT shows a higher activity, which is intermediate between that of Pt/AC and that of Pt/ACox. Furthermore, the catalytic behavior is closer for catalysts Pt/ACoxT and Pt/ACox (higher activity, similar apparent activation energies), in spite of their very different mean particle sizes, than for Pt/ACoxT and Pt/AC, with similar metal dispersions. This points to particle size not being mainly responsible for the observed activity trends. The products obtained in the gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde in the conditions used in this study are butanal, crotyl alcohol, butanol and butane, the latter two in small amounts (< 5% molar fraction). Selectivity is initially governed by the preferential hydrogenation of either the olefinic C=C bond yielding butanal, or the carbonyl C=O bond yielding crotyl alcohol. Then, this two compounds can suffer subsequent hydrogenations to produce butanol and butane, and crotyl alcohol may also isomerize to butanal. The extent of these secondary reactions, which affect the catalyst selectivity, can be modified by the overall conversion degree; thus, it is necessary to compare the catalysts' behaviors as a function of this parameter. The evolution of selectivity towards crotyl alcohol is plotted in Fig. 7 as a function of the conversion obtained at four F.

Evolution of selectivity towards crotyl alcohol as a function of the overall conversion for the three catalysts. Reduction temperature: 623 K. reaction temperatures: 313,333, 353 and 373 K. It can be seen that, whereas Pt/AC produces selectivities which are lower than 10% over the whole conver- sion range, catalysts prepared with oxidized supports are much more selective towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond, obtaining up to 30% crotyl alcohol under the most favorable conditions (low conversions). Selectivities towards butanol and butane are very low and similar for the three catalysts, in such a way that the increase in the crotyl alcohol yield goes parallel to a decrease in the production of butanol. Thus, the use of preoxidized activated carbon supports produces catalysts which are more active, (in terms of turnover frequencies for the overall reaction) and selective towards the unsaturated alcohol (crotyl alcohol). In order to determine the origin of the different behaviors displayed by catalysts Pt/AC, Pt/ACoxT and Pt/ACox, their catalytic properties were analyzed after reduction at higher temperatures, 723 and 773 K. The catalytic activity values obtained (ixmol g Pt-~ s-t), along with the apparent activation energies, are reported in Table 5. Two main effect of the reduction temperature can be envisaged. On one side, there is an increase of the catalytic activity by increasing the reduction temperature, but the three catalysts behave in different ways. The increase is very small (if any) for catalyst Pt/AC.

Finally, the effect is more pronounced for catalyst Pt/ACoxT. The activity after reduction at 723 K is nearly twice as high as that obtained after reduction at 623 K, and a further increase is observed after reduction at 773 K. Fig. 2 shows that platinum dispersion, as measured by the Ipt:Ic XPS ratio, decreases for the three samples when the reduction temperature is increased from 623 to 723 K. Thus, the specific activities for the crotonaldehyde hydrogenation are strongly enhanced by increasing the reduction temperature. The second effect of reduction temperature is on the selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond to yield crotyl alcohol, and it is observed only in catalysts prepared with oxidized supports. The selectivity showed by the catalysts after reduction at different temperatures are plotted in Fig. 8 as a function of the overall conversion degree. It can be seen that no selectivity F. Coloma et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 165-183 181 modification is produced in catalyst Pt/AC, but an increase in the reduction temperature favors the production of the unsaturated alcohol for both Pt/ACoxT and Pt/ACox. For Pt/ACoxT, the maximum selectivity is obtained after reduction at 723 K, whereas for Pt/ACox, selectivity is still increased after reduction at 773 K, achieving crotyl alcohol yields near 60% under the most favorable conditions. Two main reasons could account for the observed behavior of carbon-sup- ported platinum catalysts, in relation to the oxygen complexes content of supports. First, the decomposition-reduction of oxygen surface groups on the support yields carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water to different extents, and the presence of these compounds in the activating atmosphere, even at low partial pressures, may influence the growth of platinum crystallites, favoring the preferential development of crystal faces with distinct catalytic properties. Furthermore, this effect can be enhanced by the reduction temperature itself [29,33]. It has been shown, by working with well defined Pt single crystals [34] and also from quantum chemical calculations [35], that the metal face exposed conditions the adsorption mode of the a,/3-unsaturated aldehyde, which is essential in determining the reaction selectivity. Thus, the selectivity on Pt(110) in the vapor phase hydrogenation of prenal (3-methyl-butenal) has been reported to be in favor of the saturated aldehyde, whereas it is totally different on Pt(l 11), where the unsaturated alcohol is predominant [34]. Second, active centers are formed on the carbon surface upon the decomposi- tion of oxygen surface groups, which can chemisorb nascent hydrogen spilt from the platinum surface. It has been shown in Fig. 5 that the amount of this kind of hydrogen increases with the reduction temperature, and the initial content of oxygen complexes on the support is a trend which is parallel to the increase of the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol. The beneficial effect of the hydrogen species placed on the support in the vicinity of the platinum crystallites could arise from a polarizing effect on the carbonyl bond, through their interaction with the oxygen atom. This interaction would withdraw electronic density from the C =O bond and activate it for the attack of hydrogen atoms chemisorbed on the platinum surface. Under this assumption, the increase of the reduction temperature will enhance the selectiv- ity towards the unsaturated alcohol mainly on catalysts with highly oxidized supports, as it is actually observed, given that it favors the decomposition of a higher amount of oxygen groups if they are available. 4. Conclusions Monometallic-activated carbon supported platinum catalysts which are highly active and selective for the production of crotyl alcohol in the vapor-phase 182 F. Coloma et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 165-183 hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde have been prepared by using preoxidized activated carbons as supports. It has been shown that this behavior is not related, at least in an important extent, to the metal particle size, which is lower when the support contains a great amount of oxygen surface groups. An increase in the reduction temperature favors the catalytic activity and selectivity, but this effect is restricted to catalysts with preoxidized supports. It is proposed that the observed behaviors is related to the decomposition-reduc- tion of surface oxygen groups upon the thermal treatments at which the catalysts are subjected before catalytic measurements.

Three activated carbons were prepared with different content of oxygen surface complexes and impregnated with aqueous solutions of [Pt(NH3 4]Cl2. The catalysts were characterized by H2 and CO chemisorption at room temperature, temperature-programmed decomposition (TPD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and their catalytic behavior in the vapor phase hydrogenations of benzene and crotonaldehyde (trans-2-butenal) was determined. Metal dispersion is highly dependent on the degree of support oxidation, being lower for the catalyst support containing the highest amount of surface acidic complexes. This is attributed to the decomposition of the surface complexes, which act as anchoring centers for the platinum precursor, upon the reduction treatments at which the catalysts are subjected. The specific catalytic activity in the gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde is higher as the starting support is more oxidized, and the activity per gram of platinum increases with reduction temperature. The selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonilic CO bond instead of the olefinic CC bond is also improved when an oxidized support is used, and the production of the unsaturated alcohol, crotyl alcohol, is enhanced when catalysts are reduced at higher temperature, especially those prepared with oxidized supports.

        "dc:description": "Three activated carbons were prepared with different content of oxygen surface complexes and impregnated with aqueous solutions of [Pt(NH3 4]Cl2. The catalysts were characterized by H2 and CO chemisorption at room temperature, temperature-programmed decomposition (TPD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and their catalytic behavior in the vapor phase hydrogenations of benzene and crotonaldehyde (trans-2-butenal) was determined. Metal dispersion is highly dependent on the degree of support oxidation, being lower for the catalyst support containing the highest amount of surface acidic complexes. This is attributed to the decomposition of the surface complexes, which act as anchoring centers for the platinum precursor, upon the reduction treatments at which the catalysts are subjected. The specific catalytic activity in the gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde is higher as the starting support is more oxidized, and the activity per gram of platinum increases with reduction temperature. The selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonilic CO bond instead of the olefinic CC bond is also improved when an oxidized support is used, and the production of the unsaturated alcohol, crotyl alcohol, is enhanced when catalysts are reduced at higher temperature, especially those prepared with oxidized supports.",
