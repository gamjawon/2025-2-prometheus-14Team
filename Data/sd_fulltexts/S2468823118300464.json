Graphical abstract A series of Fe/SiO2 catalysts with different strontium/iron molar ratios were used to investigate the chemical and structural effects of strontium on the iron-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) catalysts. It was found that the chemical effect of strontium strengthened FeO bonds of Fe2O3 and hence suppressed the reduction of iron oxide. The chemical effect also suppressed the H2 adsorption but improved the CO adsorption, which is responsible for the low surface H/C ratios and methane selectivity. At the same time, the promotion of strontium improved the dispersion of iron oxides. The dispersion effect facilitated the reduction and carburization of catalysts. It was also helpful for the H2 adsorption and in turn led to high surface H/C ratios and methane selectivity. Under the combined action of the chemical and structural effects, the selectivity to methane of catalysts exhibited a parabola-like trend as a function of strontium loading and passed through a minimum at Sr/Fe molar ratio of 6/100. In contrast, the selectivity of heavy hydrocarbon demonstrated an opposite tendency. Keywords Fischer-Tropsch synthesis Iron based catalyst Structural effect Chemical effect Strontium 1 Introduction The growing concerns about depletion of crude oil have boosted global interest in finding alternative feedstocks for petrochemicals and liquid fuels [1,2]. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is an alternative route for converting syngas derived from coal, natural gas or biomass into liquid fuels and chemicals [3]. Iron, cobalt, ruthenium and nickel are active metals for the FTS, but only iron and cobalt are used industrially. Due to the low cost, high FTS and water-gas-shift (WGS) activity, feed flexibility (H2/CO = 0.5–2.5), iron-based catalyst is the preferred catalyst for the FTS using low H2/CO ratio syngas derived from coal [4]. To improve the FTS performance of iron-based catalyst, many studies have been performed to evaluate the effects of many promoters on FTS performances of iron-based catalysts, especially alkalis, copper, manganese and silicon [5–12]. Alkaline-earth metals are supposed to be significant promoters for iron-based FTS catalysts, owing to their alkaline properties similar to alkali metals. Luo et al. [13] investigated the influences of Be, Mg, Ca and Ba on iron-based catalysts for FTS. They concluded that Be, Mg, Ca and Ba improved the formation of liquid product but decreased the formation of gas fraction product. In our previous work [8], we systematically studied the effects of Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba on the FTS performances of iron-based catalysts with a mole ratio of promoter/iron = 0.02. We found that the addition of Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba reduced the selectivity of CH4 and facilitated the production of olefin and C5 + hydrocarbons obviously. More importantly, strontium was found to be the most effective promoter in tuning the product distribution among alkali-earth metals. Generally, the promotional effect of promoter depends on its contents added. The variation of potassium loading content plays significant influences on its promotional effects [12,14–19]. The selectivity of olefins and higher molecular products increases, the activity of WGS increases, while the FTS activity either increases or passes through a maximum depending on the potassium loading. Gallegos et al. [20] studied the role of Mg on the FeSiO2 FTS catalysts. The results indicated that the rate of total hydrocarbon formation inclined as a function of Mg content, and that the selectivity of olefins and heavy hydrocarbons was increased by the suitable level of Mg. Yang et al. [21] found that the carburization extent, the FTS activity, space time yields of C5 + increased with the increase of Mg content, and passed through a maximum at an Mg/Fe weight ratio of 0.07. Tao et al. [22] studied the effect of Ca on the Fe-Mn FTS catalysts. The results showed that the FTS and WGS activity, methane selectivity decreased with the increase of Ca contents. They also concluded that an appropriate amount of Ca promoted the reduction and carburization of Fe-Mn catalysts, but the excessive promotion would decrease the extent of the reduction and carburization. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report about the influences of different strontium loading on iron-based FTS catalysts. Besides, alkaline-earth metals simultaneously have some properties like structure promoters except for their chemical effects. The increase of strontium loading will boost its structural effects, which is helpful to get a deep insight into the structural effect, chemical effect and their synergistic effect of strontium on FTS iron-based catalysts. This paper aims to investigate structural and chemical effects of strontium on precipitated Fe/SiO2 catalysts. Many characterization techniques were employed to analyze the textural properties, structure, reduction and adsorption of catalysts. The characterization results were correlated with the FTS performance of catalysts in order to give a deep insight into the promotional effects of strontium. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The catalysts precursors used in this work were prepared by co-precipitation and spray-drying method as following steps: a solution of Fe(NO3)3 was mixed with silica sol with Si/Fe atomic ratio = 5:100. The mixed solution precipitated using NH4OH solution at T = 70 °C and pH = 8.5–9.0. The obtained precipitate was washed with deionized water, and then filtered. The strontium was introduced by wetness impregnation with Sr(NO3)2, and followed by spray-dried and calcination at 500 °C for 5 h. The Sr/Fe was kept with mol ratio of xSr/100Fe, x = 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 15, these are denoted FeSi, 2Sr, 4Sr, 6Sr, 10Sr, and 15Sr. 2.2 Catalyst characterizations The BET surface area was measured via N2 physical adsorption in a Micromeritics ASAP 2420 equipment. XRD patterns were recorded using Bruker D8 Advance X-ray laboratory diffractometer with Cuκa radiation (γ = 1.5406 Å) at a rate of 0.02° (2θ)/second from 20° to 80°. Mössbauer characterizations were conducted in an MR-351 constant-acceleration Mössbauer spectrometer (FAST, Germany) drive with a triangular reference signal at room temperature. H2/CO-TPR and H2-TPD studies were performed on AutoChem II 2920 equipment (Micromeritics, USA) equipped with TCD detecter. CO-TPD studies were also carried out on AutoChem II 2920 equipment (Micromeritics, USA) equipped with a mass spectrum detector. (Details of the characterization are described in the supporting information) The reduced catalyst samples used for Mössbauer characterization were prepared by reducing the fresh catalysts in a quartz tube with synthesis gas (H2/CO = 2) at 553 K, 0.10 MPa and 1000 h-1 for 20 h. After reduction, the catalysts for Mössbauer measurements were coated with paraffin to prevent oxidation. 2.3 Catalyst evaluation The catalytic tests were conducted in a tubular fixed-bed reactor (i.d. 12 mm). Prior to reaction, all catalysts were reduced in situ with syngas (H2/CO = 2.0) at 280 °C, 0.10 MPa, and 1000 h−1 for 20 h. Following the pretreatment, the reactor was cooled to 200 °C, then the reaction system was set at 260 °C, 1.5 MPa, 2000 h−1, and H2/CO = 2.0. A detailed description of the reactor and the product analysis system has been provided elsewhere [12,23]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural and chemical effects of strontium Table 1 lists the BET surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter of the as-prepared catalysts. The surface area generally increases, while the average pore diameter decreases with the increase of the strontium contents. The pore size distribution (PSD) of the as-prepared catalysts is shown in Fig. 1 . The PSD curve of strontium promoted catalysts moves to smaller pore diameter compared with that of the unprompted sample. With increasing strontium contents, the pore diameter shifts to small pore diameter continuously. This may be due to the fact that the incorporation of strontium into the porous precipitate precursor prevents the collapse of the pore structure during thermal treatments [11]. Fig. 2 shows the Mössbauer spectra of the fresh catalysts, the spectra parameters are summarized in Table 2 . The Mössbauer spectra of the unprompted catalyst include only a sextet, which is assigned to the magnetic α-Fe2O3 with large srystallites [24]. For the strontium promoted catalysts, a doublet is detected excepted for the sextet, which is ascribed to the superparamagnetic Fe3+ (spm Fe3+) with smaller crystallites [24]. As the spectral areas listed in Table 2, the unprompted catalyst is composed of 100% ferromagnetic α-Fe2O3. However, for the strontium promoted catalysts, the amounts of spm Fe3+ increase with the increase of strontium contents. These results reveal that the dispersion of iron oxide species is improved with the promotion of strontium, the dispersion effect strengthens with increasing the strontium contents. The results of MES agree well with those of the BET characterization. Fig. 3 displays the Raman spectra of the catalysts as prepared. For FeSi catalyst, a series of characteristic bands of FeO bond for Fe2O3 located at 217, 283, 392, 497 and 597 cm−1 are observed [25,26]. With the addition of strontium, these characteristic bands of FeO bonds shift to higher frequency. It indicates that the FeO bond of catalyst is strengthened with modification of strontium. 3.2 Reduction and carburization behaviors The H2-TPR profiles of catalysts are presented in Fig. 4 a. For the unprompted sample, two well-uncoupled peaks contributed to the reduction of iron oxides from α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 and Fe3O4 to α-Fe could be detected [10]. With the addition of strontium, the front reduction peak gradually moves to higher temperatures for 2Sr, 4Sr and 6Sr catalysts, while it gradually moves to lower temperatures for 10Sr and 15Sr. The second reduction peak become separated at high temperatures for the strontium-promoted catalysts. That is, there is a broad and large peak in temperature range of 400–650 °C, which enlargers and shifts gradually towards lower temperatures with the increase of strontium contents. The peak at above 650 °C gradually moves to higher temperature as the strontium contents increase. The H2-TPR results suggest that the incorporation of low loading of strontium suppresses the reduction of iron oxides in the catalysts, while the reduction of iron oxides would be facilitated with high levels of strontium addition. The inhibitive effect is probably owing to the strong chemical interaction between strontium and iron oxides, which has been verified in our previous work [8,27]. The chemical interaction between strontium and iron oxides will strengthen the FeO bonds, which in turn make the iron oxides become difficult to be reduced. For the high strontium levels promoted catalysts, the addition of strontium advances the dispersion of iron oxides obviously as displayed in the above BET and MES results. Of course, the promotion of strontium would decrease the particle size of iron oxides. Iron oxides have small particle sizes with a larger percentage of surface atoms, which are easier to react with H2 during the reduction [9]. Therefore, the reduction of iron oxides would be facilitated by high loadings of strontium. The CO-TPR profiles are displayed in Fig. 4b. Four obvious peaks are found in the profile of FeSi catalyst. A very weak peak before 270 °C is ascribed to a small amount of iron oxides easily reduced. The second peak located at 290–320 °C can be contributed to the convesion of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4. The carburization peak is detected at 400–650 °C. The last peak located above 650 °C could be ascribed to some iron oxides species with strong interaction with silica [28]. With the promotion of strontium, the CO-TPR profiles vary obviously. The first reduction peak enlarges continuously with the contents of strontium increasing. This is due to the dispersion effect of strontium, which consequently decreases the particle size of iron oxides. Iron oxides with small particle sizes have a higher probability of contact with CO and could be reduced more easily. However, the temperature of the second peak shifts gradually to higher temperatures as the contents of strontium increase. As reported in our previous work [8,27], alkaline earth metals have a strong chemical interaction with iron oxides. This interaction strengthens FeO bonds in α-Fe2O3 and make iron oxides difficult to be reduced. Thus, the reduction of the iron oxide species underlying and/or neighboring the strontium shifts to higher temperatures. For the carburization peaks, as shown in Fig. 4b, the addition of strontium has obvious influences on the carburization of catalysts. The carburization peak enlarges and moves to lower temperature, while the peak above 650 °C gradually decreases and almost disappears with the increase of the strontium contents. These suggest that strontium facilitates the carburization of catalysts. It results from improvement of the CO dissociation adsorption promoted by strontium. XRD and MES were used to determine the phase compositions of the activatied catalyst. Only the characteristic bands of Fe3O4 are detected for the XRD patterns of all the catalysts (Fig. 5 a), but the intensity of peak weakens with the increase of strontium contents. The MES spectra of the FeSi catalyst included four sets of sextets (Fig. 5b), however an additional doublet is detected for the spectra of strontium doped catalysts. The sextets with Hhf of 485 ± 1 kOe and 457 ± 3 kOe represent the Fe3O4 phase. The sextets with Hhf of 213–228 kOe and 110 kOe are assigned to Fe5C2 [29], while the sextet with Hhf of 175–183 is ascribed to ε-Fe2.2C [22,30]. The doublet represents the Fe2+ with small crystallites [31]. As listed in Table 3 , the contents of Fe3O4 decrease continuously, while the amounts of superparamagnetic Fe2+ increase gradually with the contents of strontium increasing. However, the amounts of iron carbide differ not at all among the unprompted catalyst and strontium-promoted catalysts. 3.3  H2 and CO chemisorptions H2-TPD was conducted to investigate the H2 adsorption behaviors of the catalysts, as presented in Fig. 6 . For all the catalysts, H2 desorbed peaks appear mainly in two broad temperature domains. Desorption peaks under 300 °C are sharp with somewhat less defined shoulders. At the same time, a broad and weak peak is observed at 400–600 °C, accompanying a relatively narrow peak. In the case of FeSi catalyst, a sharp peak at about 100 °C with shoulders at 120–300 °C, and a small peak at 608 °C are detected. Apparently, the addition of strontium significantly affects the H2 adsorption behaviors over the catalyst surface. For catalysts with Sr/Fe atomic ratios less than 6/100, the peaks at the low temperature range become small and sharp with shoulders gradually disappearing, meanwhile, this desorption peak slightly shifts to low temperature. The peaks at the high temperature range become broad and strong with the increase of strontium contents. For samples with Sr/Fe atomic ratios higher than 6/100, the low temperature desorption peaks become broad, while the high temperature desorption peaks weaken gradually. Based on our previous works [5,7–9], the H2 desorbed under 200 °C is assigned to Hα, which is from the H2 adsorbing at the top adsorption sites of Fe surface. The hydrogen species desorbed at 200–300 °C are designated Hβ, which result from hydrogen occupied on the deep hollow or defect sites of Fe surface. The H species desorbed at above 300 °C are assigned to Hγ, which ascribed to hydrogen chemisorbed onto unreduced iron oxides. To quantitatively analyze the amount of corresponding hydrogen species, the H2-TPD profiles were fitted with Gaussian curves to yield several peaks. The fitting results are listed in Table 4 , the amounts of Hα species gradually decrease with increasing the content of strontium, reach a minimum at Sr/Fe ratio of 6/100 and then slightly increase. The Hβ species vanish over lower content of strontium doped catalysts (2Sr, 4Sr and 6Sr), but emerge and increase with further increasing strontium contents. These results suggest that the H2 adsorption on surface iron sites is inhibited with modification of strontium, but the inhibiting effect presents a parabola-like tendency as a function of strontium content and passes through a maximum at Sr/Fe ratio of 6/100. CO-TPD profiles over the pre-carburized catalysts are displayed in Fig. 7 . The main CO desorption over all catalysts mainly happens at the temperature range of 240–600 °C. Only a tiny peak around 305 °C can be found over the CO-TPD profile of the FeSi catalyst. With the modification of strontium, the peak of CO desorption moves towards high temperature, while the peak intensity sharply advances with the increase of strontium contents. Besides, an additional peak above 410 °C can be observed over the profiles of the strontium promoted catalysts. A similar enlarging variation trend as a function of strontium is observed for this additional peak. According to our previous studies [5,7–9], the CO desorbed at 240–600 °C is related to the recombination of surface adsorbed C and O atoms. The desorption peak at around 300 °C belongs to desorption of surface and/or near-surface carbon and oxygen species, while the higher-temperature peak is due to the reaction of bulk iron carbides with neighboring iron oxides. CO-TPD results apparently indicate that the addition of strontium remarkably improves the surface CO dissociation adsorption and strengthen the surface Fe-C bonds. 3.4 FTS performance FTS performance of catalysts was measured at 260 °C, 1.5 MPa, 2000 h−1, and a H2/CO ratio of 2:1. Typical reaction results are summarized in Table 5 . It can be found that the initial CO conversion of 2Sr, 4Sr and 6Sr increases slightly compared to that of FeSi, whereas it increases remarkably to 66% and 90% for the 10Sr and 15Sr, respectively. Besides, all of the strontium-promoted catalysts exhibit obvious deactivation behaviors during the FTS reactions. According to the carbide model [32,33], the FTS activity of iron-based catalysts depends on the levels of bulk iron carbides. However, the phase analysis of the reduced samples suggests that there is no obvious difference in the bulk iron carbides contents of the unprompted and strontium promoted samples after activation. It means that the mounts of iron carbides are not quantitative correlate with the FTS activity of catalysts in this work. In fact, many reports have been revealed that the FTS activity is determined by the active site on the catalyst surface layers. Li et al. [34] reported that FTS reactions are only influenced by the density of the active sites in near-surface layers for the reduced catalyst and irrespective of the extent of bulk carburization. Niemantsverdriet et al. [35] found that bulk carburization plays no role in FTS rates. In the present study, as demonstrated by BET and MES characterization of oxide catalysts, the addition of strontium obviously improves the dispersion of iron oxide. It is probable that strontium has remarkably effects on the active sites on the surface of catalyst, which results in the increases in the initial CO conversion for the strontium-promoted catalysts. Fig. 8 displays the methane and heavy hydrocarbons (C5 +) selectivities of catalysts. Table 5 lists the detailed hydrocarbon distributions at TOS of 24 h and 144 h. It can be seen that the selectivity to methane shows a rapid and monotonic decrease with the increase of strontium loading and passes through a minimum at strontium loading of 6 mol%. After this point, it increases with further increasing in strontium content. However, the selectivity of heavy hydrocarbons (C5 +) demonstrates an opposite tendency to methane selectivity. Besides, the selectivity to olefins is promoted with the increasing strontium levels. The distribution of FTS product is affected by a lot of factors. However, as revealed in our previous works [8], alkaline-earth metals modify the distribution of FTS product mainly by tuning the surface H/C ratios over catalyst surface. In the present study, the results of H2-TPD and CO-TPD suggest that the promotion of strontium has significant influences on the surface H2 and CO adsorption of catalysts, which in turn varies the surface H/C ratios on the catalyst surface. As discussed in the foregoing sections, strontium has two major promotional effects (the chemical effect and the dispersion effect) on the iron-based catalysts. The chemical effect would lead to an electron enrichment of iron species, which is resulted from the strong basicity of strontium [36,37]. The electron rich state of Fe would inhibit H2 adsorption, improve the dissociative adsorption of CO and lead to a lower surface H/C ratio on the surface of catalyst. The lower surface H/C ratio is beneficial to the carbon chain growth and leads to an increase in heavy hydrocarbons selectivity. The dispersion effect, on the other hand, decreases the particle size and hence increases the proportion of surface iron atoms. These surface iron atoms would provide more active sites for the H2 and adsorption, which leads to a higher surface H/C ratio on the catalyst surface. Higher surface H/C ratio would increase the hydrogenation ability and in turn increase the methane selectivity. Therefore, for the lower loading strontium promoted catalysts (2Sr, 4Sr and 6Sr), the dispersion effect is weak and the chemical effect is dominant. With the loading of strontium further increasing, the chemical effect is still existent, while the dispersion effect increases and becomes dominant. Under the combined action of the chemical and dispersion effects, the methane selectivity firstly decreases, passes a minimum at Sr/Fe molar ratio of 6/100 and then increases, while the selectivity of heavy hydrocarbon exhibits an opposite trend. 4 Conclusion The chemical and structural promotional effects of strontium and their influences on the reduction, H2/CO adsorption and FTS performances of the iron-based catalyst were evaluated. Strontium had strong chemical interactions with iron oxide species and strengthened FeO bonds of iron oxides, which was harm for the reduction of catalysts. The chemical effect of strontium inhibited the H2 adsorption and facilitated the dissociated adsorption of CO, resulting in low surface H/C ratios and methane selectivity. On the other hand, the promotion of strontium improved the dispersion of iron oxides. The dispersion effect increased with the increase of strontium loading. The dispersion effect was favorable to the reduction, carburization, H2 adsorption and methane formation. With incorporation of small amount of strontium (2Sr, 4Sr and 6Sr), the chemical effect was dominant, however, the structural effect would play the dominant role as the content of strontium added further increasing (10Sr and 15Sr). Under the combined action of the chemical and structural effects, the methane selectivity firstly decreased, passed a minimum and then increased, while the selectivity of heavy hydrocarbon exhibited an opposite trend. In addition, the initial FTS activity and olefin selectivity increased with the increase of strontium loading.
