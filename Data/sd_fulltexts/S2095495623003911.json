Graphical abstract The ZnSe-CoSe heterojunction with enhanced conductivity and robust adsorption-catalytic effect on polysulfide is rationally constructed and significantly improves the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries under high S loading and low E/S. Although lithium-sulfur batteries (LiSBs) are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for the next-generation energy storage system, the actual industrial application is hindered by the sluggish solid–liquid phase conversion kinetics, severe shuttle effect, and low sulfur loadings. Herein, a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) derived heterogeneous ZnSe-CoSe nanoparticles encapsulated in hollow N-doped carbon nanocage (ZnSe-CoSe-HNC) was designed by etching with tannic acid as a multifunctional electrocatalyst to boost the polysulfide conversion kinetics in LiSBs. The hollow structure in ZIF ensures large inner voids for sulfur and buffering volume expansions. Abundant exposed ZnSe-CoSe heterogeneous interfaces serve as bifunctional adsorption-catalytic centers to accelerate the conversion kinetics and alleviate the shuttle effect. Together with the highly conductive framework, the ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S cathode exhibits a high initial reversible capacity of 1305.3 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C, high-rate capability, and reliable cycling stability under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte (maintaining at 745 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles with a high sulfur loading of 6.4 mg cm−2 and a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6 μL mg−1). Theoretical calculations have demonstrated the heterostructures of ZnSe-CoSe offer higher binding energy to lithium polysulfides than that of ZnSe or CoSe, facilitating the electron transfer to lithium polysulfides. This work provides a novel heterostructure with superior catalytic ability and hollow conductive architecture, paving the way for the practical application of functional sulfur electrodes. Keywords Lithium-sulfur batteries Heterostructure Conversion Kinetics Hollow structure Bi-directional catalysis 1 Introduction The ever-growing urgent demand for long-lifespan and high-energy–density batteries has motivated researchers to actively explore next-generation rechargeable energy storage systems [1–4]. Lithium-sulfur batteries (LiSBs) have attracted extensive attention due to their obvious merits in their high theoretical specific capacity (1672 mA h g−1), rich natural reserves, and environment-friendly [5,6]. Nevertheless, the practical application of LiSBs is still limited by several issues. The intrinsic insulating properties of sulfur and its discharged products Li2S2/Li2S result in slow electronic/ionic transportation and high polarization. The significant volume changes of active materials caused by the phase conversion between sulfur and Li2S largely threaten the electrode structural stability [7]. Moreover, the soluble polysulfides (Li2S x , 8 ≥ x ≥ 4; LiPS) dissolved in the electrolyte are easily migrate from cathode to anode and further reduced, which leads to serious side reactions and the irreversible loss of active materials [8]. The sluggish conversion kinetics between LiPS and Li2S2/Li2S will aggravate the shuttle effect, resulting in a fast capacity decay and disappointing coulombic efficiency (CE) [9]. The typical strategy to solve those issues is to design a suitable sulfur host with high conductivity, a large surface area, and robust chemical interaction with LiPS. Up till now, the composites of nonpolar carbon and transition metal compound, such as transition metal oxide (TMO) [10,11], transition metal sulfide (TMS) [12,13], transition metal phosphide (TMP) [14,15], have been widely investigated as the functional sulfur host by their strong chemical interactions with the LiPS, which could offset the poor adsorption of non-polar carbon to LiPS. Particularly, different kinds of porous carbon hosts with high specific surface areas are designed to offer abundant active chemical sites for metal–sulfur bond formation and effectively alleviate the volume expansion of sulfur cathode, simultaneously stabilizing the electrochemical performance [16]. Heterogeneous interfaces of two or more coupled components can promote reaction kinetics and charge diffusion, regarding as an effective strategy to constrain the dissolution of LiPS [17,18]. The carbon materials derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with well-developed pores have been widely applied in the field of energy storage in recent years [19,20]. Specifically, MOF materials exhibit enhanced electrochemical performances compared to other types of sulfur hosts of LiSBs [21,22]. The metal cations coordinated with the MOF organic ligands are naturally transformed into metal compounds through annealing treatment and homogenously embedded into the carbon framework [23]. Meanwhile, the MOF-derived metal compounds can form strong chemical bonds with LiPS, further limiting the migration of LiPS in the electrolyte. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), as a kind of MOFs, were widely studied in the LiSBs field [24,25]. Among the transition metal compounds, the transition metal selenides have high conductivity, high defect density, and polarity characteristics, and the outermost layer only has a minority of electrons, which are easily lost, reducing the energy barrier of chemical reactions, and accelerating the conversion of LiPS [26]. For instance, Cabot’s group has designed a combination of ZnSe and N-doped hollow carbon (ZnSe/NHC) as a sulfur host through a facile selenization process of ZIF-8. The high-stability LiSBs benefit from the sulfiphilic ZnSe, the high surface area, and the complete physical constraint effect of NHC [27]. Therefore, it is reasonable to design MOFs-derived functional materials with heterojunction architecture, high specific surface area, and abundant active interfaces to substantially constrain the dissolution problems of LiPS and enhance the electronic conductivity and ionic transportation. Herein, we developed the ZnCo-MOF derived heterogeneous ZnSe-CoSe nanoparticles encapsulated in hollow N-doped carbon nanocage (ZnSe-CoSe-HNC) as a multifunctional electrocatalyst by introducing tannic acid to regulate the internal hollow structure of ZnCo-MOF to boost the polysulfide conversion kinetics in LiSBs. The hollow structure enables abundant inner space to load active materials and alleviate the volume variations in the repeated charge and discharge process. The heterogeneous ZnSe-CoSe nanoparticles uniformly distributed in the hollow carbon skeleton are serving as the chemical adsorption sites to LiPS, further restricting the dissolution of LiPS in the electrolyte, and effectively reducing the adverse influence of the shuttle effect. More significantly, experimental results confirm that the ZnSe-CoSe heterointerface catalytically accelerates the reduction process of LiPS to Li2S during the discharging process. Furthermore, the heterostructure would also accelerate the dissociation of solid Li2S, improving the coulombic efficiency of LiSBs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that, compared with pure ZnSe, the heterojunction (HJ) of ZnSe-CoSe has shown a continuous line at the forbidden band with enhanced electronic conductivity. After LiPS adsorbed on the interface of ZnSe-CoSe HJ, a great quantity of electron transfer occurs between ZnSe-CoSe and Li2S4 molecule, displaying a large number of electron accumulations on the HJ interfaces. Besides, the upper state near the Fermi level of ZnSe-CoSe has abundant electrons, which makes it easier to participate in the phase transformation of LiPS. Benefiting from the catalytic function of bi-directional selection and the merits of HNC, the ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S cathode has exhibited excellent long-term cycle stability (average capacity decay rate of 0.046% at 1 C and 0.044% at 2 C per cycle). Even at high sulfur loading of 6.4 mg cm−2 and a low E/S of 6 μL mg −1, the cathode still delivered a high initial capacity of 906.2 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of precursors Solution A was prepared by adding 0.35 g of ZnH12N2O12 and 0.35 g of CoH12N2O12 into 50 mL methanol. Solution B was formed by mixing 1.9 g of 2-methylimidazole (2-MIL) and 0.2 g of CTAB in 50 mL of methanol. With strong stirring, solution B was quickly poured into solution A, and then it was stirred at room temperature for 24 h, then centrifuged and washed with ethanol 3 times, and vacuum-dried at 60 °C overnight to obtain ZnCo-MOF. 0.10 g of ZnCo-MOF was dispersed in 20 mL deionized water and sonicated for 1 h to form a well-distributed suspension, then 0.16 g tannic acid (TA) was added into the above suspension and stirred for 10 min, Finally, the ZnCo-MOF@TA composites were collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol for 3 times and vacuum-dried at 60 °C for 12 h. 2.2 Synthesis of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC, ZnSe-CoSe-NC, ZnSe-NC, CoSe-NC host Typically, 50 mg ZnCo-MOF@TA and 50 mg selenium powders were placed in two porcelain boats and transferred to a tubular furnace with ZnCo-MOF@TA on the downstream side. The tubular furnace was heated at 600 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 under an Ar atmosphere to obtain the ZnSe-CoSe-HNC. In addition, ZnSe-CoSe-NC was synthesized according to the same route without adding tannic acid. ZnSe-NC was synthesized according to the same route without adding tannic acid and Zn source, and the preparation of CoSe-NC was the same as the above route without adding tannic acid and Co source. 2.3 Synthesis of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S, ZnSe-CoSe-NC/S, ZnSe-NC/S and CoSe-NC/S cathodes The various sulfur cathodes were prepared by a traditional melt-diffusion method. Typically, the various sulfur hosts were ground uniformly with sublimed sulfur, and the mass ratio between host and sulfur was set to 3:7. The composites were transferred to an autoclave and dealt with a constant 155 °C for 12 h. 2.4 Synthesis of LiPS solution For preparing Li2S6, Li2S and sublimed S powders were added to the solvent consisting of 1,2-dimethoxyethane and 1,3-dioxolane (v:v = 1:1) and stirred for 2 days in the glovebox at 60°, the mole ratio of Li2S and sublimed S is 1:5. For preparing Li2S8, Li2S and sublimed S with a moral ratio of 1:7 dissolved in tetraglyme under stirred for 2 days in the glovebox. 2.5 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to analyze the phase information of samples (Cu Ka radiation with k = 1.5405 Å) at 40 kV from 5° to 80°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Nova Nano SEM450, 15 k eV) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM 2100F) were applied to characterize the morphologies and structures. The elemental distribution of samples was analyzed by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford Instrument and EDAX Inc). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on ESCALAB 250 to investigate the chemical valence states. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured for the specific surface area and pore diameter of samples (77 K, Tristar 3000). In situ XRD (Bruker D8 Advance) measurements were used to analyze the evolution information of sulfur species in cells during the charging/discharging process from 20° to 32°. 2.6 Electrochemical measurements Coin cells (CR2032) were assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox with ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S, ZnSe-CoSe-NC/S, ZnSe-NC/S, and CoSe-NC/S as cathode, commercial Celgard2400 as the separator, and lithium slice (φ15.6 mm) as the anode. Electrolyte (1.0 M lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl) imide and 2.0 wt.% LiNO3 dissolved in 1,2-dimethoxyethane and 1,3-dioxolane (v:v = 1:1) is employed around 15 μL for each cell. The electrochemical performances were performed using a NEWARE battery measurement system (CT-4008Tn) at room temperature, the potential range of charge/discharge cycling is 1.7–2.8 V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis was recorded on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760e) with the potential between 1.7 and 2.8 V at a scan rate of 0.1–0.6 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was tested under a frequency range from 1 MHz to 100 kHz and an applied amplitude of 5 mV. 3 Results and discussion ZnSe-CoSe-HNC host materials were prepared by a coprecipitation method followed by tannic acid etching and annealing selenization treatment, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). Typically, the Zn-Co bimetallic polyhedral MOF with the size of ∼100 nm and smooth surface was prepared by mixing Zn2+ and Co2+ as bimetal sources with 2-MIL. The H+ cations in TA could enter the interior of the ZIF crystal for chemical corrosion, thus forming a hollow Zn-Co MOF structure (Figs. S1 and S2) [28,29]. As is shown in the SEM images of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC (Fig. 1b and c), the size after selenization is about 100 nm, and the internal hollow structure can be proven from the damaged ZnSe-CoSe-HNC in high-temperature annealing, which can offer ample space for the melt diffusion process of sulfur and the storage of LiPS on the cathode side. To compare the structure advantages after TA treatment, ZnSe-CoSe-NC without TA etching was also characterized by SEM in Fig. 1(d). The heterogeneous particles of ZnSe-CoSe-NC were well-combined polyhedral nanobox with the size of about 100 nm with no obvious hollow structure. On the contrary, the hollow feature of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC can be observed by the TEM image in Fig. 1(e), exhibiting an average wall thickness of about ∼20 nm, well consistent with SEM images. The HRTEM of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC reveals the existence of several lattice fringes among amorphous carbon walls (Fig. 1f). The lattice fringe of 3.30 Å is consistent well with the (111) plane of ZnSe, and the lattice fringe of 2.70 Å is well matching with the (101) planes of CoSe. The grain boundary interfaces between ZnSe and CoSe are exhibited clearly in HRTEM. The similar lattice fringe distances and interfaces also emerge in the HRTEM of ZnSe-CoSe-NC in Fig. 1(g), displaying the lattice fringes of 2.70 Å for the (101) crystal planes of CoSe, and the lattice spacing of 3.30 Å for the (200) crystal plane of ZnSe. Interestingly, the increased specific surface area (the specific surface area of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC and ZnSe-CoSe-NC are 236.5 and 106.9 m2 g−1) is unveiled from the two intensified hysteresis loops (Fig. 1h) in the N2 adsorption–desorption measurement and the large value difference of surface areas further demonstrated the successful formation of the hollow structure after chemical etching. The pore size distribution in Fig. 1(i) has demonstrated the enriched mesopores in both ZnSe-CoSe-HNC and ZnSe-CoSe-NC, and the average pore size (4.95 nm) of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC is slightly smaller than that of ZnSe-CoSe-NC (9.47 nm), exposing more active interfaces of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC as the host–guest interactions and smaller size distribution of mesopores for facilitating the physical limitation of LiPS. Fig. 1(j) shows the elemental distribution of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and EDS mapping images confirm the uniform elements distribution of C, N, Se, Co, and Zn in the heterostructure composite. The TGA characterization of four host/sulfur composites was also conducted (Fig. S3), and the analysis results showed that the sulfur contents of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S, ZnSe-CoSe-NC/S, CoSe-NC/S, and ZnSe-NC/S are 68.5%, 66.3%, 68.3%, and 66.2%, respectively. Besides, the SEM and TEM images of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S nanocomposites in Figs. S4 and S5 have revealed the well-maintained morphology after the melt diffusion of sulfur owing to the hollow structure and high specific area, with no obvious sulfur accumulation around the polyhedron due to the hollow structure. The EDS mapping of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S also shows S, Co, Zn, N, and Se elements are uniformly distributed on the carbon skeleton derived from ZnCo-MOF (Fig. S6), and sulfur is well encapsulated by the hollow structure of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC. In addition, the structures and morphologies of ZnSe-NC and CoSe-NC were also characterized by slight morphology changes. The SEM image of ZnSe-NC in Fig. S7 reveals a polyhedral geometry with a size of 400–500 nm, while the CoSe-NC polyhedron shows a rougher surface, indicating successful selenization (Fig. S8). The XRD analysis was conducted to confirm the crystal phase of the synthetic products. The XRD patterns of Zn-MOF and Co-MOF precursors in Fig. S9 have exhibited similar intensified diffraction peaks, and the peak intensity of Co-MOF is slightly weaker than that of Zn MOF, which is consistent with the previously reported work [30]. XRD pattern of the ZnCo-MOF precursor in Fig. S10 matched well with the peaks of Zn-MOF and Co-MOF precursors. After TA etching, all peak positions are well maintained, only the peak intensity is slightly weaker. Fig. 2 (a) shows the XRD patterns of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC, ZnSe-CoSe-NC, ZnSe-NC, and CoSe-NC, respectively. The main intense diffraction peaks of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC at 27.2°, 51.5°, and 53.6° are attributed to ZnSe (PDF#15–0105), and the obvious diffraction peaks at 33.5°, 45.2°, and 51.5° correspond to CoSe (PDF#07–7223), similar to ZnSe-CoSe-NC, confirming the successful synthesis of heterogeneous ZnSe-CoSe. In addition, the XRD characteristic peaks of ZnSe-NC and CoSe-NC well correspond to ZnSe (PDF#15–0105) and CoSe (PDF#70–2870). The XRD patterns of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S are shown in Fig. S11, confirming the successful load of sulfur, while the obvious characteristic peak of ZnSe and CoSe were still maintained. To evaluate the adsorption capacity to LiPS (using Li2S6 as a representative one), simple visual adsorption experiments were conducted by immersing the various functional host materials in the yellow–brown Li2S6 solution (Fig. 2b). The solution color of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC gradually turns transparent from 30 min to 24 h, while other solutions are still brown, exhibiting outstanding chemical affinity and physical absorption to Li2S6. Furthermore, UV–visible spectroscopy was conducted on pure Li2S6 solution and after adsorbed Li2S6 solutions. After the adsorption reaction with different sulfur-host materials, the supernatant with ZnSe-CoSe-HNC delivered the lowest UV–vis absorbance compared to other materials, revealing that the strong interaction between ZnSe-CoSe heterostructure and LiPS, and the effective restriction of the shuttle effect of LiPS. The XPS spectra of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC before and after the Li2S6 adsorption were also investigated to prove the adsorption behavior of LiPS. XPS spectra show the existence of C, N, O, Co, and Zn elements in the ZnSe-CoSe-HNC and ZnSe-CoSe-NC (Fig. S12). Specifically, the C 1s high-resolution XPS (HR-XPS) spectra (Fig. S13) of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC were divided into four peaks, corresponding to C–C (284.8 eV), C–N (285.3 eV), C–O (286.5 eV) and C=O (288.3 eV), respectively [31]. The N 1s HR-XPS (Fig. S14) spectrum is convoluted into three peaks, categorized into three items: graphitic N (401.0 eV), pyrrolic N (399.3 eV), and pyridinic N (398.5 eV) [32]. The N 1s spectra and C–N bond in C 1s spectra suggested N was successfully doped into the carbon polyhedron. The two diffraction peaks at 1021.9 and 1045.0 eV of Zn 2p HR-XPS spectra in Fig. 2(c) are corresponding to Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2. After Li2S6 adsorption, the binding energies of two peaks are increased to higher binding values (1022.3 and 1045.3 eV), relating to the losing electrons and higher chemical bonding capability [33]. A similar peak shift also occurred in the Co 2p spectra (Fig. 2d), displaying the binding energies at 779.2 and 782.0 eV for Co–Se and Co–O bonds of Co 2p 3/2. In Co 2p 1/2 orbit, the binding energies of the Co–Se and Co–O bonds were located at 796.4 and 798.3 eV, respectively. The Co–O species were found due to surface oxidation or surface adsorption of O2 [34]. The aforementioned peak-shift in Co 2p 3/2 (779.2 → 780.8 eV and 782.0 → 782.8 eV) and Co 2p 1/2 (796.4 → 797.0 eV and 798.3 → 800.3 eV) spectra of after reaction with the Li2S6 solution is associated to the higher binding energy, indicating the enhanced interaction between Co sites and sulfur species [35]. Besides, the signal intensity of the Co–Se bond is increased while the peak strength of the Co–O bond is decreased after the reaction, implying that the Co–O species on the surface was reduced to Co-S by Li2S6 [26]. Meanwhile, the two divided peaks (Se 3d 3/2 and Se 3d 5/2) of Se 3d also move towards higher binding energies (Fig. 2e). The Li 1s spectra (Fig. 2f) of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC with Li2S6 have shown Li-S and Li-N signals and located at 54.6 and 55.6 eV, because of the formation of Li-N chemical bonds in reaction [36]. Fig. S15 shows the S 2p HR-XPS spectra after the reaction between ZnSe-CoSe-HNC and Li2S6, displaying the characteristic peaks of thionatesulfite and polythionate after reactions. Specifically, two peaks at 170.5 and 169.7 eV are belonging to the polythionate, and two peaks at 168.9 and 169.2 eV are belonging to the thionatesulfite, indicating the strong interactions with LiPS. Meanwhile, the XPS spectra of other samples after interaction with LiPS were also analyzed. The results shows that the Zn 2p spectra of ZnSe-NC and the Co 2p spectra of CoSe-NC move towards higher binding energy after reaction, and the Se 3d spectra also move similarly to that of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC, indicating that ZnSe-NC and CoSe-NC also have chemical adsorption capacity with LiPS (Figs. S16 and S17). To further investigate the interface interaction between LiPS (using Li2S4 as an example) and ZnSe-CoSe at the molecular level, the charge transfer between Li2S4 and different catalytic host materials (simulated crystal structures of graphitized carbon (G), N-doped graphitized carbon (N-G), ZnSe, ZnSe-CoSe) was discussed based on DFT (Fig. S18), the optimized Li2S4 is placed near the surface of different active substrates to achieve geometric relaxation (Figs. S18–S22) [37,38]. The light yellow part and scarlet blue of Fig. 2(g–j) represent the charge depletion area and accumulation area, respectively. Fig. 2(g and h) display the charge difference density after the structural relaxation of G and N-G adsorbing Li2S4, respectively. Charge accumulation occurs near the C atoms in both G and N-G, verifying the graphitized carbon also participates in the adsorption through the loss of charge. It can be seen from Fig. 2(i) that the Li atom in Li2S4 tends to bond with the Se atom of ZnSe, while the terminal S atoms are inclined to bond with the Zn sites via the electrostatic attraction. More notably, compared with the ZnSe scheme, there is a great quantity of electron transfer between Co and S atoms after the adsorption of Li2S4 on the heterogeneous interface of ZnSe-CoSe (Fig. 2j), and the charge is redistributed and aggregated near Li2S4 molecule, demonstrating that the robust bond between ZnSe-CoSe and Li2S4 molecules is one of the essential bases for the high adsorption capability. The Li2S4 molecule has occasion to accept electrons after adsorbing the active substrate surface, the calculations showed that the amount of electron transfer from Li2S4 to the G, N-G, ZnSe, CoSe, ZnSe-CoSe are 0.78, 0.82, 1.44, 1.87 and 3.51 e, respectively. The more charge transfer on the reaction interface, the stronger the anchoring ability of ZnSe-CoSe to LiPS. Meanwhile, the calculation results show that the binding energy of Li2S4 on the ZnSe-CoSe heterogeneous (2.96 eV) surface is much higher than those of G (0.67 eV), N-G (0.69 eV), ZnSe (1.40 eV) and CoSe (1.19 eV), indicating that LiPS is effectively fixed on ZnSe-CoSe surface, mitigating the shuttle effect. Moreover, the differential charge density and corresponding binding energy of N, N-G, ZnSe (111), CoSe (001), and ZnSe-CoSe HJ interacting with Li2S6 were also calculated (Figs. S23–S27). As shown in Fig. 2(l–p), compared to ZnSe and CoSe, the intrinsic electronic conductivity of ZnSe-CoSe HJ is improved by the DOS calculation with more electrons at the Fermi Level, giving more possibility of the electron transporting from the valence band to conduction band. And the adsorption energy of ZnSe-CoSe HJ (0.55 eV) is between the high absorption energy of ZnSe (1.01 eV) and low value of CoSe (0.14 eV) to Li2S6, promoting the electron transportation and the reversible absorption capability to Li2S6 during charge and discharge processes. Therefore, we believe that the ZnSe-CoSe HJ has exhibited high electronic conductivity and reversible absorption capability to LiPS when applied as LiSBs cathode. The electronic structures of various materials were evaluated by the density of states (DOS) simulation to clarify their electronic conduction tendencies. Fig. 3 (a) shows the DOS of G, N-G, ZnSe, and CoSe. There are zero band gap extended states near the Fermi levels of G, N-G, and CoSe, illustrating conductive property. In addition, the electron cloud of N-G near the Fermi level further increases to a certain extent, compared to G, which benefits electronic transportation. While the ZnSe possesses the property of a semiconductor. Fig. 3(b) depicts the projected density of states (PDOS) curves of Se, Zn, and Co with the corresponding full DOS of ZnSe-CoSe HJ. In comparison with that of ZnSe, the ZnSe-CoSe HJ has an increased valence band energy level, the increase of electron cloud near the Fermi level of ZnSe-CoSe mainly relies on the introduction of Co elements to generate impurity energy level, inducing enhanced electronic conductivity. Moreover, the DOS plot of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC-Li2S6 after absorption has shown a slight decrease of electron density at the Fermi level in Fig. S28, compared to the host materials of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC, and the PDOS plot has verified that the main electronic conductivity of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC-Li2S6 is originating from d-orbital. In general, the N doping of graphitized carbon and the introduction of a heterogeneous interface make the upper state near the Fermi level of ZnSe-CoSe possess rich electrons and thus easier to participate in the transformation of LiPS [39]. The catalytic properties of the various cathode materials were assessed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) on Li2S6-symmetrical cells in the potential window from −1.0 to 1.0 V at 10 mV s−1 (Fig. 3c). The ZnSe-CoSe-HNC electrode shows much higher current than other electrodes when voltage changes, meaning that the ZnSe-CoSe heterostructure accelerates the electron transfer at the interface with the LiPS and the related reaction kinetics during liquid-to-solid conversion. Li-S coin-cells were also assembled to evaluate the electrochemical property. Fig. 3(d) displays the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of different cathodes between 1.7 to 2.8 V at 0.1 mV s−1. Two reduction peaks at ∼ 2.36 and 2.05 V are identified as the phase conversions from S8 to high-order LiPS (Li2S x , 6 ≤ x≤ 8) and then converted into short-chain LiPS and Li2S2/Li2S [40]. The ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S cathode has delivered the highest and sharpest current peak compared with other electrodes, implying the fastest current-responsive behavior. One typical oxidation peak at ∼2.4 V is observed, attributed to the oxidation reaction process of the active materials in ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S from Li2S2/Li2S to LiPS and then further to sulfur. Besides, except for the first cycle, there are no obvious peak shifts or current changes in well-overlapped CV curves of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S, illustrating excellent cycling reversibility (Fig. S29), which is much better than other electrodes in both reversibility and current-responsive capability. The Tafel slopes based on the first cathode peak of CV curves are depicted in Fig. 3(e). The ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S cathode exhibits a smaller slop of 45.1 mV dec−1 in comparison with 59.4 mV dec−1 for ZnSe-CoSe-NC/S, 67.1 mV dec−1 for CoSe-NC/S and 63.0 mV dec−1 for ZnSe-NC/S, suggesting the superiority of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC for boosting LiPS conversion kinetics [41]. Besides, CV curves at different scanning rates are carried out to study the lithium-ion diffusion behavior of the LiSBs. Fig. S30 displays the CV curves of various cells at 0.1–0.6 mV s−1, with all peaks current linearly enhanced with the increasing scan rate. Lithium-ion diffusion coefficients corresponding to three peaks of CV curves were calculated by the Randlese-Sevcik equation [42,43]. The calculation and fitting curves are shown in Fig. S31 and Fig. 3(f). The ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S cathode delivers the slopes of peaks O (227.0), R1 (97.0), and R2 (111.7), higher than those of other cells, suggesting the high lithium diffusion of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S and thus reduce the viscosity of the electrolyte [44,45]. The different catalysis effects of cathode materials from soluble LiPS to solid Li2S and the reverse reactions were further analyzed by the electrostatic potential precipitation (Fig. 3g and h). The initial current decreases at the initial stage of constant potential discharge possess, which is mainly ascribed to the capacitive effect, while the electrochemical precipitation of Li2S leads to the increment of discharge current thereafter. The Li2S deposition on ZnSe-CoSe-HNC has shown the largest and sharpest current peak response and the earliest emergence of the current peak at 3508 s compared to those of ZnSe-CoSe-NC (5508 s), CoSe-NC (6243 s), and ZnSe-NC (8582 s) electrodes. ZnSe-CoSe-HNC (206.4 mA h g−1) exhibits the highest precipitation capacity of Li2S, higher than ZnSe-CoSe-NC (174.5 mA h g−1), CoSe-NC(119.3 mA h g−1) and ZnSe-NC(107.7 mA h g−1). Besides, the dissolution behavior of Li2S was investigated via constant potential charging at 2.4 V (Fig. S32). Similar to the deposition test, ZnSe-CoSe-HNC led to an earlier dissolution time of Li2S and higher specific capacity, thus achieving the largest dissolution capacity. The above result demonstrated that the heterostructure of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC provides bi-directional catalysis to simultaneously promote the efficiency of nucleation and dissolution of Li2S [46,47]. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of different functional hosts is further conducted to analyze the catalytic abilities as shown in Fig. 3(k). Among them, ZnSe-CoSe-HNC shows the lowest onset potential and the highest current density response, demonstrating the significant effect of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC on decreasing the energy barrier to the Li2S oxidization conversion. By comparing the calculation and experimental results of ZnSe and CoSe, it can be found that ZnSe has stronger adsorption ability and CoSe has stronger catalytic ability. Thus, due to the synergistic effect of their unique properties and heterogeneous interfaces, the ZnSe-CoSe exhibit high redox kinetics and reduced shuttle effect. To systematically assess the superiority of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC as the sulfur host material, the LiSBs with ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S cathode were assembled and conducted. The cycle performances of different cathodes at 0.2 C are shown in Fig. 4 (a), where the ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S cathode has displayed an initial discharge capacity of 1305.3 mA h g−1, exhibiting the highest specific capacity than other cathodes (ZnSe-CoSe-NC/S, 1259.2 mA h g−1; CoSe-NC/S, 1219.7 mA h g−1; and ZnSe-NC/S, 1205.6 mA h g−1, respectively), and maintaining 973.9 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. The initial discharge potential at 0.2 C shown in Fig. S33 depicts that all cathodes exhibit a low initial discharging potential due to the excellent catalytic capacity of selenides, and the lowest potential of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S (1.86 V) cathode means the energy required for Li2S conversion is significantly reduced. Therefore, from Fig. S34, after repeated charge/discharge possess of 20 cycles, there is the lowest value of polarization voltage (ΔE = 130.5 mV) in the charge/discharge curves of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S cathode than ZnSe-CoSe-NC/S (ΔE = 145.4 mV), CoSe-NC/S and ZnSe-NC/S (ΔE = 178.2 and 154.8 mV) electrodes. Significantly, the largest ratio value of Q L/Q H (2.41) in cells with ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S cathode further demonstrated fast redox kinetics of ZnSe-CoSe heterostructure and effective LiPS inhibition effect (Fig. 4b). Fig. 4(c) compares the rate performance of different electrodes, and the ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S delivered significantly superior specific capacity among them. Specifically, the reversible capacities of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S were 1234.8, 1061.9, 882.1, 712.2, 603.3, 536.5, and 469.2 mA h g−1 at current rates of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3,4 and 5 C. When the C-rate was back to 0.2 C, the specific capacity recovered to 1195.6 mA h g−1 without the obvious downward trend. While the poor capacities of other cathodes were attributed to the sluggish redox kinetics and low sulfur utilization, thus resulting in irreversible loss of active material and severe electrochemical polarization. In addition, charge/discharge curves corresponding to different current densities of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S were shown in Fig. S35, the overpotential increases with the gradual increase of current density, however, the typical two discharge platforms of LiSBs remained even with the C-rate up to 5 C. The long-term cycling performance (Fig. 4d) shows that the ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S electrode provides an initial capacity of 971.7 mA h g−1, and a discharge capacity approaches 522 mA h g−1 with a low average capacity decay rate of 0.046% per cycle and a high coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.68% after 1000 cycles. Nyquist plots in Fig. 4(e) reveal that the ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S electrode exhibits a smaller charge transfer resistance (R ct) compared to the other cathodes, illustrating charge transfer is more favorable on the interface between ZnSe-CoSe-HNC and LiPS [48,49]. Fig. 4(f) schematically depicts the adsorption and catalytic conversion of LiPS. Specifically, the hollow structure with a high specific surface area exposes abundant ZnSe-CoSe chemisorption sites, which limits the diffusion of LiPS, and then the heterogeneous interface provides generous electrochemical catalytic sites to accelerate the conversion of LiPS to Li2S during the discharging process and simultaneously ensures the fast solid–liquid-solid conversion kinetics during the charging process. The long-cycle stability for ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S electrode at a higher current rate of 2 C was also investigated to demonstrate the strong catalytic conversion ability of ZnSe-CoSe heterostructure, after being activated at 0.1 C for 3 cycles and shown in Fig. 4(g). ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S still maintained the reversible capacity of 899.9 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles with a low capacity decay rate of 0.044% per cycle, which demonstrates its outstanding long cycling stability at a high rate. Moreover, compared with previous works of high-performance LiSBs, the ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S cathode exhibits impressive high initial discharge capacity and low cyclic decay rate (Fig. S36). Fig. S37 shows the TEM image of the ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S cathode after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. The polyhedral structure remains intact and undamaged, indicating that the sulfur species are well limited during the cycling process and ZnSe-CoSe-HNC exhibits well structural stability. To explore the sulfur species conversion mechanism in the ZnSe-CoSe-HNC electrode in the charging/discharging process, in-situ XRD measurement was performed with the related voltage–time profiles displayed on the left as shown in Fig. 5 (a). At the initial discharging stage, the diffraction signals of α-S8 at 23.1°, 26.8°, 27.8°, and 28.7° were detected. With the proceeding of the discharge process, the diffraction signal of α-S8 gradually disappears until it completely disappears at ∼2.17 V, corresponding to the phase conversion from α-S8 to LiPS. When the potential drops to ∼1.7 V, a blurry and broad peak representing the (110) crystal plane of Li2S at 27° emerges, corresponding to the full phase conversion from LiPS to Li2S. When it is charged, the peak intensity of Li2S gradually decreased till disappeared in the middle of the charging process, then accompanied by new signals of β-S8 appearing at 26.7° and 28.3° at the end of the charging process, indicating phase conversions from α-S8-LiPS-Li2S to Li2S-LiPS-β-S8 by the reaction promotion of ZnSe-CoSe heterostructure and well suppresses the shuttle effect [50,51]. The high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte in the cells are rigidity requirements for practical commercial applications, and thus cyclic performances of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC were recorded under high sulfur loading and different proportions of electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 5(b), in a sulfur loading of 3.2 mg cm−2, the ZnSe-CoSe-HNC@S cathode provides specific capacities of 737.8 mA h g−1 and remains a high reversible capacity of 541.0 mA h g−1 after 250 cycles at 1 C. Even at a high sulfur loading of 6.4 mg cm−2 and a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 6 μL mg−1, the cell still achieved an initial discharge capacity of 906.2 mA h g−1 with superior cycling stability and an average coulombic efficiency of 99.8% in 100 cycles (Fig. 5c). The effect of various hosts on the self-discharge behavior was also studied and shown in Fig. 5(d). All batteries were charged with a constant current until the open circuit voltage (OCV) reached 2.80 V and then stand for 24 h [52]. After that, the OCV of the ZnSe-CoSe-HNC@S cathode remained at 2.360 V because of superior inhibition of the shuttle effect. In contrast, other cells exhibited serious self-discharge phenomena, leading to low open circuit voltage. To verify the potential usability of ZnSe-CoSe-HNC@S cathodes in the actual application scenario, a pouch cell based on ZnSe-CoSe-HNC@S was assembled to detect the working conditions at different bending angles as shown in Fig. 5(e). At the initial angle of 0°, the pouch cell successfully powers a light-emitting diode (LED), and the brightness of the LED remains unchanged when the battery is bent to 90°, implying the electrochemical stability of the ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S electrode in practical application. 4 Conclusions In summary, the hollow N-doped carbon nanocage encapsulated heterostructure ZnSe-CoSe-HNC material was synthesized by combining TA acid etching and high-temperature selenization and used as the functional adsorption-catalysis and sulfur host, in which the hollow structure formed by TA etching, providing sufficient spaces for high sulfur loading and alleviating volume variations. DFT calculation results prove that ZnSe-CoSe has the strongest binding energy with polysulfides than those of G, N-G, and ZnSe. The introduction of heterojunction largely enhances the electronic conductive property of ZnSe-CoSe, ensuring the high charge transfer property. The results of catalytic experiments show that the heterostructure induces the fast nucleation of Li2S and promotes the solid–liquid conversion in the charging stage, thereby alleviating LiPS shuttling and facilitating redox kinetics. The in-situ XRD contour maps have confirmed the phase conversions from αS8-LiPS-Li2S to Li2S-LiPS-βS8 by the reaction promotion of ZnSe-CoSe heterostructure and well suppresses the shuttle effect. Therefore, the cells with ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S exhibit a high discharge capacity of 1305.3 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C, excellent long-term stability with a low average capacity decay of 0.046%, and 0.044% per cycle at 1 and 2 C. In particular, under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte consumption (6.4 mg cm−2 sulfur loading and a low E/S of 6 mg μL−1), the cell achieved an initial capacity of 906.2 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C and maintained a high reversible capacity of 745 mA h g−1 in 100 cycles. The proposed general synthesize method for heterostructure is paving the way for other similar materials applied in energy storage and electrocatalysis.

        "dc:description": "Although lithium-sulfur batteries (LiSBs) are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for the next-generation energy storage system, the actual industrial application is hindered by the sluggish solid–liquid phase conversion kinetics, severe shuttle effect, and low sulfur loadings. Herein, a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) derived heterogeneous ZnSe-CoSe nanoparticles encapsulated in hollow N-doped carbon nanocage (ZnSe-CoSe-HNC) was designed by etching with tannic acid as a multifunctional electrocatalyst to boost the polysulfide conversion kinetics in LiSBs. The hollow structure in ZIF ensures large inner voids for sulfur and buffering volume expansions. Abundant exposed ZnSe-CoSe heterogeneous interfaces serve as bifunctional adsorption-catalytic centers to accelerate the conversion kinetics and alleviate the shuttle effect. Together with the highly conductive framework, the ZnSe-CoSe-HNC/S cathode exhibits a high initial reversible capacity of 1305.3 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C, high-rate capability, and reliable cycling stability under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte (maintaining at 745 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles with a high sulfur loading of 6.4 mg cm−2 and a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6 μL mg−1). Theoretical calculations have demonstrated the heterostructures of ZnSe-CoSe offer higher binding energy to lithium polysulfides than that of ZnSe or CoSe, facilitating the electron transfer to lithium polysulfides. This work provides a novel heterostructure with superior catalytic ability and hollow conductive architecture, paving the way for the practical application of functional sulfur electrodes.",
