W. MAY* AND J. W. LINNETTf From the Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory, Oxford University, Oxford, England Received August 23, 1966; revised December 14, 1966 Recombination of 0 atoms on evaporated films of Ag, Cu, Au, and Cr was stud- ied by an effusion method. Recombination efficiencies derived from measurements of heat liberated at the surface are in substantial agreement with other methods. The chance y that an 0 atom colliding with the surface leaves as part of an Oi molecule was measured for Ag and Cu films in the temperature range 300-375. For silver, VAE =0.75 exp(20/RT) and for copper, you =0.9 exp(600/i?r). For gold VAU was 6 X lO\"3 at 305 and 12 X 10-' at 347. Chromium films gave erratic results. Films of Ag reacted with 0 atoms to produce AgO, and those of copper and chromium showed evidence of oxidation also. Films of Au were not tarnished by atomic 0. I. INTRODUCTION This paper presents an effusion method for measuring the absolute efficiency of the recombination of atoms at surfaces. The efficiency y is denned as the chance that an atom colliding with the catalytic surface leaves it as part of a diatomic molecule. Nakada and co-workers (1, 2) have used \"effusion\" to establish an activity series for the recombination of hydrogen atoms on metals. A disc containing an in- terior thermocouple was coated on either side by a different metal. Presentation of each face to a jet of partially dissociated gas issuing from an orifice (not proper ef- fusion) allowed an activity series to be established by comparing the temperature rises of two metals at a time. Other and different experiments in flow systems (S-7) have measured the change required in elec- trical power input to keep isothermal a metal filament exposed to atoms, and the recombination efficiency was calculated using the assumed atomic flux, the geo- * Department of Engineering Physics, Comell university Ithaca, New York. + Professor of Physical Chemistry, university of Cambridge, Cambridge, England. metrical area of the filament, and an inde- pendent measure of the atom concentra- tion. In the present experiments partially dis- sociated oxygen gas was allowed to effuse under the Knudsen conditions [8) into a vessel evacuated by a fast pumping system (Fig. 1). A fraction of the atoms struck a thin circular Pyrex detector disc coated with the active surface. The detector was mounted perpendicular to, and coaxial with, the effusion axis. Of those atoms that struck the disc face, a fraction y would recombine there. The recombination efficiency was ob- tained from the electrical power cor- responding to the heat of the atom asso- ciation by knowing the atom to surface collision number determined by the effu- sion characteristics. The power developed by recombination was measured by a plati- num resistance thermometer on the reverse side of the detector from the atom flux. Its resistance, which also measured the disc temperature, was' an arm in a Wheat- stone bridge circuit. The power developed by the atom re- combination was of the order 10\"\"4 W, com- pared with about 1 W for typical flow sys- tem experiments. This disadvantage was 324 ATOM RECOMBINATION AT SURFACES i Oxygen 325 To Rotary Punp FIG. 1. Apparatus: 0 atoms were produced in a quartz tube by an electrodeless discharge at region of coil C (powered by rf transmitter T). Atoms diffused into Chamber I which had glass walls, and where total pressure was 10-' torr, and eventually effused through orifice H into Chamber II <10-* torr), which had brass walls. Atoms striking detector disc D (see Fig. 4) could liberate energy to disc by recombining into 0, molecules at the catalytic film on the disc surface. Chamber II was pumped by fast oil diffusion pump F through cold trap E. The detector disc could be observed with illumina- tion L through window K, and its distance from H adjusted by bellows drive Q. M is a McLeod gauge and W a Wrede gauge for measuring 0 atom concentration. AA and B are micro-pirani (hot^ wire) pressure gauges. lonization gauge V measured pressure in Chamber II. Asterisks indicate position- ing of Ag foil to prevent passage of 0 atoms, but there was no exposed metal between C and H. The large volume-to-surface ratio of Chamber II kept atom loss by recombination small. Chamber I was painted black to stop room light from reaching detector. compensated for by a good knowledge of the atom flux, its angular distribution, and the geometry of the system. The sideann diffusion method of Smith (9) which has been used extensively (10-18} gives y as directly proportional to the atom/molecule diffusion coefficient (19-23). An advantage of the present method is its independence of the diffusion coefficient; measurements of y by the Smith method, or modifications of it (34, 2, are only as accurate as that quantity. Moreover if the temperature variation of 7 is investigated by a diffusion method, resort must usually be made to a semiempirical or theoretical estimation of the diffusion coefficient and its temperature dependence. Another advantage of the new method is that it is best for very active surfaces of 7 > 10-2, which is just the region where methods based on diffusion become intractable (12, 26, 27). True effusion into a vacuum through an orifice occurs when, as in these experi- ments, the mean free path on the high- pressure side is much larger than the orifice dimensions. If the effusant at P dynes/cm2 is a partially dissociated gas having atom mole fraction and the orifice is considered to have infinitesimally thin walls, then the number of atoms passing per second through the hole of area A is, according (28) to the kinetic theory, 326 MAY AND LINNETT W where m is the mass of the atom and A; is Boltzmann's constant. In real systems the flow is less than predicted by (1) due to reflections from the orifice walls. Clausing (39) has calculated the reduced flow as a function of the diameter d and length l of the orifice considered as a cylindrical chan- nel. The calculations also show that the angular distribution of the effusant is al- tered by the finite channel length. Com- pared with perfect effusion, the probability that the effusing molecules emerge at a large angle 6 to the effusion axis is reduced. The effect calculated by Clausing may be expressed as / == r\" T(0,l,d) sin 28 d6 (2) In (2) / is the chance that a molecule of the effusant, after entering the channel of a real orifice, emerges on the other side within a cone whose sides are an angle Om to the effusion axis. T(0,l,d) is a compli- cated function which reduces to 1 for per- fect effusion when / = sin2 (?. Equation (2) may be written in terms of a function B so that / = B sin2 0 (3) The orifice used in this work is shown in Fig. 2. The area measured by micropro] ec- tion was 1.98 X lO\"3 cm2 (mean diameter 0.050 cm). The length of the channel was 0.012 cm. B was calculated by numerical integration and the effect of the channel length for this work is shown in Fig. 3. Although the orifice was not a point source of atoms the effect on the angular distribution was negligible. A formula de- rived by Keene (SO) was applied and the maximum error in / was calculated as 0.1% from this effect. The measurement of 7 then depended on the following assumptions: (i) That atoms which missed the detec- tor never returned as atoms and also that those striking the detector face did so once only before being recombined on the brass walls of Chamber II or pumped (Fig. 1). Calculations based on the experimental conditions show these assumptions to be justified because 7 for the walls was almost certainly larger than 10\"2. The calculation also applied to the back of the detector which was protected by a resistant inac- tive varnish. (ii) That atoms travel in straight lines to the detector from the orifice. This is justified by the background pressure. <-/1 - FIG. 2. Orifice cross section. The orifice was a hole drilled ultrasonically through 0.012-cm thick Pyrex disc; the disc was then cemented by shellac- based wax over a bevelled 1-cm hole centered in a Pyrex plate 2.5 mm thick. The bevel was 60to the effusion axis (Fig. l). 130X. (iii) That the atom concentration at the detector is the same as the concentration measured on the high-pressure side by a Wrede-Harteck gauge. (iv) That only ground state atoms (10) arrive at the detector. (v) That there is negligible recombina- tion within the short channel of the glass orifice. This is justified because 7 for glass is very small, and the chance of atoms hitting the orifice walls is also small. (vi) That the difference between the effusant temperature and that of the detec- tor results in no measurable power loss. No cooling of the detector by acccommo- dation was observed (detector temperature held between 30and 100 and pressure ATOM RECOMBINATION AT SURFACES 327 of oxygen in chamber I varied sixfold with discharge off). (vii) That electronically or vibration- ally excited molecules do not release heat to the detector (see later). Fio. 3. Effect on angular distribution in effu- sion caused by dimensions of orifice. Lower curve is for the orifice used for this work [Eq. (3)]. (viii) That only electronic ground state molecules result from recombinations, and the whole dissociation energy is liberated to the surface (see later). If D is the ground state dissociation en- ergy in kcal/mole and N is Avogadro's number, the heat liberated per atom strik- ing the detector is 0.5-yD/N. using Eq.

In the present experiments, with T = 300, and with oxygen atoms, K = 0.243/a/P W-1 (5) II. EXPERIMENTAL 1. Materials and Methods a. Oxygen supply. Oxygen was obtained by electrolysis and leaked into the ap- paratus through a thermostated needle valve. The pressure behind the leak was kept at 740 torr automatically. During ex- periments oxygen flowed towards the orifice H in competition with the very much larger flow maintained by the pumping line (Fig. 1). With this arrangement a stable pres- sure could be maintained in Chamber I, and fresh oxygen would continually pass into the silica discharge tube. b. Positioning of detector disc. The de- tector could be moved towards or away from the orifice in vacuum, and was held by a detachable steel bellows system. A steel tube, lined up with the effusion axis, carried the leads away from, and ultimately supported, the detector. The tube was con- nected to a worm gear drive, allowing rela- tive positions of the detector to be read to 0.02 mm in a movement of 37 mm. The platinum wire (40 swg) leads from the detector were set in a jack-plug connection to the supporting tube. The bellows sys- tem, seated on an 0-ring, could be un- screwed and the detector passed out through a 1-inch hole. During experiments Chamber II (Fig. 1) was maintained at 25C to prevent random temperature fluc- tuations in the region surrounding the de- tector. c. Measurement of the atom concentra- tion by Wrede-Harteck gauge. A differen- tial micro-Pirani Wheatstone bridge was used, similar to that of Greaves and Lin- nett (13). A micro-Pirani hot wire gauge of a design similar to theirs, Aw (Fig. 1), was connected to the Wrede-Harteck gauge, W. During an experiment the equilibrium pressure difference AP that developed be- tween the interiors of Aw and a reference micro-Pirani Ar was measured as an effec- tive change in resistance across the bridge, in which the hot tungsten wires of Aw and 328 MAY AND LINNETT Ar were opposite resistances. It may be shown that a = 3.41(AP)/P To calibrate the bridge A so that AP and hence a could be calculated, another bridge B was used. With the valve S and taps 1 and 2 closed (Fig. 1), taps 3, 4, and 5 open, the micro-Pirani B could be first calibrated against the McLeod gauge M. Then with tap 4 closed and an imposed pressure difference between Chamber I and the interior of the McLeod gauge, the dif- ferential bridge A was calibrated. During experiments with atoms the reference micro- Pirani Ar was separated from the discharge plasma by a section of 4-cm Pyrex tubing containing a cylindrical lining of silver foil 10 cm long. The effect was to prevent atoms reaching Ar without permitting a pressure difference to develop. During experiments tap 3 was closed. The micro-Pirani gauges, which had no temperature-compensating leads, were thermostated by water flowing through brass cases which enclosed them almost completely. The Wrede gauge W had a volume of about 15 cc, and the cal- culated 99% equilibration time (13) was 5 sec. The Wrede gauge consisted of a B24 cone ground flat to accommodate a cir- cular cover slip containing a central hole of 0.05-mm diameter. After the interior had been lined with silver foil, the cover slip was cemented into position with Araldite resin. d. Detector-disc heating elements. Re- sistance thermometer elements were pre- pared with Liquid Bright Platinum 05-X (Hanovia). The method was due to Vidal (31). Pyrex discs, 2-cm diameter and 0.012 cm thick, were washed in chloroform, then painted with a zigzag line passing across the disc so that each bend was near the circumference. After the discs had been fired they were immediately removed from the oven and allowed to cool rapidly in the laboratory air. Platinum leads were sol- dered to the shiny film using the flux recom- mended by Vidal. After testing the sol- dered joints for strength, each detector was water-washed, dried, and the circuit side only painted over with Atlas Epidura var- nish. The varnish both protected the cir- cuit and strengthened the disc. Evaporated metal films, after use, could then be re- moved by acid and the disc used anew. Detector discs are shown in Fig. 4. FIG. 4. Detector disc. Mounted on jack plug, and unmounted, showing platinum resistance thermometer (wavy line on back of disc). e. Atom heat detection bridge. The re- sistance of the detector element, Ra, was balanced against a resistance box R (0-11 111 ohms) in a standard Wheatstone bridge. The other two fixed arms deter- mined the bridge ratio of 24.93. The emf across the bridge was provided by two 6-V accumulators in series. The potential across the bridge was adjusted by two other resistances, a fine and a coarse one, respec- tively in series and parallel with the sup- ply. The potential across J?a could be meas- ured by two potentiometers I and II connected in series and using a potential di- vider of 1.270 and 3 K, so that the true emf across Rs was divided by 3.36. Out-of- balance current was observed on a gal- vanometer G, which was shunted by 470 ohms and was in series with a variable sen- sitivity control 0-10 K. f. Detector discs as resistance ther- mometers. The temperature coefficient of resistance of each detector heating element was obtained using the atom heat detector bridge with the detector placed in a fur- nace heated to 200. The resistance of the detector was measured as the furnace was allowed to cool, and temperature near the ATOM RECOMBINATION AT SURFACES 329 detector was measured at the same time by a thermojunction. Linear variation of re- sistance with temperature was obtained, and for the 12 heating elements used in this work the mean temperature coefficient of resistance was 1.86 0.18 X 10\"3 per , in good agreement with Vidal (31). The fired paint had a resistance of about 3 ohms/square. Variability in resistance was caused by nonreproducibility of paint thickness. Most of the resistance thermom- eters had resistances between 100 and 150 ohms. g. Production of the discharge; screen- ing and pickup. Radiofrequency power was generated from the oscillator and output stages of an RCA transmitter type ET- 4336-H at 13.75 Me/see (32). The dis- charge was produced within a copper coil. In most cases 100 W of rf power were dis- sipated. The coil was \"tank\" tuned so as to antiphase nodal radiation from the ends. The oxygen discharge was usually an in- tense flamingo pink at 10-2 torr, and was checked from spreading by earthed copper chokes. All circuitry was carefully screened, as had been found mandatory by Greaves and Linnett (13). Bridges and galvanometer movements were housed in earthed metal containers. Brass housings around the micro-Pirani gauges screened the filaments inside. However, electrical pickup on the sensitive bridges was a re- curring and persistent cause of trouble, probably due to a semisaturated earth con- nection to the screening. Pickup was re- duced to a tolerable level by adjusting the earth connections with the aid of an oscil- loscope. To check that the atom detector bridge had the necessarily negligible de- flection due to pickup, conditions of a re- combination experiment were simulated ex- cept that the face of the detector was left as clean glass. The recombination heat liberated on such a face should be unob- servable in our experiments (y of the order 10~4). Pickup was therefore considered ab- sent only when essentially no deflection was observed away from balance of the atom detector bridge when a reasonable atom concentration was indicated by the Wrede gauge bridge. Frequent checks were re- quired and were made. Pickup and its pos- sible effect on the measurement of atom concentration caused the greatest uncer- tainty in the results. h. Destruction of atoms by activation of Chamber I. No atoms were recorded at the detector after long times of operation. It was inferred that part of the interior of Chamber I became catalytically active for a reason not discovered. This gradual proc- ess did not affect calculation of y as both H and a of Eq. (4) decreased in propor- tion. If the glassware from the discharge tube to the orifice was dismantled it could be deactivated by soaking in dilute nitric acid, but unfortunately deactivation did not last for more than about 15 discharge hours, after which another dismantling would be needed. i. Preparation of evaporated metal films. Evaporated metal films were prepared by standard technique (33, 34) in a 10-inch bell jar under a background pressure less than 10~8 torr. Films were prepared from Johnson and Matthey Specpure silver, gold, and chromium. Copper films were made from CP pellets. The copper and gold (as foil) were lightly pickled in decinormal nitric acid and washed in distilled water before use. Silver, copper, and gold were evaporated from molybdenum boats, chro- mium and copper from tungsten baskets. Copper films from either source appeared the same. During evaporation, the source was covered by a hemispherical Pyrex mask with a 1-inch hole just above the source. Each detector to be coated was supported upside down by its leads so that its face was about % inch above the mask exit. The impurity concentration of the films was estimated from the data of Heavens (35) to be less than 1 part in 104. In the case of chromium there was some doubt about purity because the source was often slightly etched after evaporation. All films were estimated to have thickness in the range 0.3-1.5/1, and had high reflectivity and the appearance of the bulk metal. That the films be as little contaminated as pos- sible, they were only exposed to the air for a few minutes, the time necessary to re- move them from the evaporation unit and 330 MAY AND LINNETT mount them inside Chamber II, which was then at once evacuated. 2. Measurement of the Electrical Power Equivalent of Recombination When the discharge is turned off, the detector disc cools. Its resistance ther- mometer changes resistance by A. and there is a change of potential across it AY. If the resistance with the dicharge on is Ad ohms and the potential drop across it V and if Vexpti is the experimental value measured by the two potentiometers I and II connected in series as has been described (see Section II,e), then 7/3.36 = Fexpu = V, + Fn (6) 1/ = 24.93/- 1/(1270 + 3000) (7) The electrical power equivalent H of re- combination can then be written H = A(py = 2FAT7. - (F/^'A (8) Two methods were used to measure H which we call the Isothermal and the Cool- ing Curve Methods. In the Isothermal Method the discharge was turned off and the change in voltage across 7?a required to return Rn to its value with the dis- charge on was measured. In the Cooling Curve Method, an analysis was made based on the detector's cooling curve when the discharge was turned off. This cooling curve was related to the time change of the out-of-balance current developed acoss the detector bridge after the discharge had been turned off. In (8), AY = To T^a and A-Bd = {Ro (-Ra)a. The presence, or not, of atoms at the detector is indicated by the subscripts a and 0. a. Isothermal method. Using (6), (7), and (8) and the condition that A. is made zero for this method (see above) and as- suming the other resistances in the bridge to be unaltered, Hi = (3.36)2(27expuAyexptl)[(24.93/J^) - /4270] = (3.36)2(7 (9) where is the power difference in watts actually measured and AVexpti is the change AFn, V i being held constant. b. Cooling curve method. Consider the atom heat bridge at balance. If R were altered -)-1 ohm, the galvanometer spot of G would move a distance AO. The spot should be returned to the null position by changing Ea by +1/24.93 ohms, because both the bridge current and V would not be appeciably changed (R^ was of the or- der 100 ohms in most cases). It was possible to obtain for each detector ele- ment, when Chamber II was held at the experimental pressure of 2 X lO\"6 torr, a calibration curve A-R/AC? as a function C of R, (,dR/dG)s = C (10) Also it was found empirically that under the same conditions a graph of Vexpu versus R gave a good straight line for each de- tector. That is AVexpti = b^R (11) Using (6), (7), (8), (10), and (11), and neglecting the term 1/4270 of (7), one ob- tains o = (3.36)2(24.93)Fexptl(AO/(7[26 - (7exp] = (3.36YW (12) Measurements of both Hi and He could be made for each experiment, by first tak- ing the cooling curve after the discharge was stopped and then readjusting R by rebalancing the bridge. In some of the ex- periments, especially when the detector was coated with copper, gold, or chromium, He alone was measured without setting the galvanometer exactly at the null position before turning off the discharge. Any re- sultant error in A(? was negligible. The value of Awas measured from each cool- ing curve by an extrapolation of the final section of the curve to the moment when the discharge was turned off. This was necessary because the detector temperature was often slowly changing due to a very gradual fluctuation of the ambient radia- tion flux. The isothermal measurements, because of drifting background tempera- ture, could easily give values of AFexpti with large errors. Values of b for the de- tectors were usually close to 2.5 X 10'3 ATOM RECOMBINATION AT SURFACES 331 ohm/V, and values of C were usually be- tween 0.1 and 0.8 ohm/cm of galvanometer scale.

Details of an experiment After the detector with its metal film had been mounted inside Chamber II, the distance- measuring counter was brought to zero when the detector was coplanar* with the interior face of Chamber II. Using the counter the detector was then set at a known distance from the orifice, and the amount of the effusant that would hit the detector face could be calculated by (3). The pumps were turned on and 3 or 4 hr were allowed for the apparatus to come to equilibrium. When the experiment was to begin, the temperature of the detector was set and the discharge was struck after the Wrede gauge bridge and the atom detector bridge had both been approximately bal- anced. After allowing at least 15 min for equilibration, the pressure at the McLeod gauge was read and the balance point of the Wrede bridge A recorded (Section II,c). The galvanometer spot for the atom detec- tor bridge was then brought near the null position from the side corresponding to ex- cess detector heat by adjusting the fine voltage control supplying this bridge. With the greater part of Vexpu backed off by potentiometer I, the remainder, which was about 0.1% of Texpti, was read with po- tentiometer II. Potentiometer I was con- stantly restandardized so that a small drift in the emf of its batteries was not mag- nified as a large error in the reading of potentiometer II. The two voltages Vi and Vn were then recorded, and a power Variac controlling the discharge turned to zero. *This was possible owing to the bevel de- scribed in captions to Figs. 1 and 2. The spot of galvanometer G then moved to the direction corresponding to a cooling of the detector, and its position was recorded at 30-sec intervals until the detector was clearly again at thermal equilibrium. The equilibration time was usually about 5 min. The spot G was then brought back to the null position and Vn again recorded. Bridge A was then out of balance because the pres- sures in the Wrede gauge and the reference Pirani had again become equal (Section II,l,c). Bridge A was rebalanced and the differential resistance corresponding to a known atom concentration was recorded. The pressure was then again measured by the McLeod gauge. All the data were then available for calculating y by Eq. (5). III. RESULTS 1. Preliminary Experiments Early attempts to measure atom recom- bination heats were nonreproducible be- cause of heating by room light. The heat- ing effect of the light could be as much as ten times that to be expected from atom recombination on silver. Light was there- fore excluded by painting chamber I black. Figure 5 shows typical behavior for turn- ing the atom discharge first on, then off. Deflections were observed for the gal- vanometers of both the Wrede and atom bridges, as well as for the pressure meas- ured with the McLeod gauge. For this experiment the detector was coated with sil- ver. The slow overall change in the tem- perature of the detector shows the effect of a changing ambient radiation. A pressure drop, fairly reproducible on a given day, was nearly always observed on striking the discharge. The effect was usually smaller than shown in the figure, but tended to in- crease as the pressure in Chamber I was lowered. The pressure drop may be ex- plained in the following way: On striking the discharge a momentary rise in pressure would be expected from dissociation of molecules, but the former equilibrium pres- sure would be reattained were it not for the fact that the number flow through the orifice is increased for a partially disso- 332 MAY AND LINNETT ciated gas. A net lowering of the pressure by this mechanism would be enhanced by the higher efficiency of the mercury diffu- sion pump, which was previously operating near its upper limit. But total pressure read at the McLeod gauge was assumed to be the same as in the discharge tube and in Chamber I during an experiment.

The detector bridge measured heat produced by atom recombination at probe D (Figs. 1 and 4). calculated linear flow of gas towards the orifice was only 0.5 cm/sec at lO'2 torr.) Pressure drops such as that of Fig. 5 neces- sitated a correction to the apparent atom concentration because bridge A was bal- anced both during an experiment and after the discharge was turned off, when the pres- sure reverted to its original value. The cor- rection was obtained from the small change in bridge balance for which a calibration had previously been determined. It was usually less than 1 part in 20. Typical cooling curves for the evalua- tion of yc are given in Fig. 6. The figure shows the loss in sensitivity for a silver catalyst when a detector of high resistance was used. On the other hand, the detector FIG. 6. Cooling curves for silver catalyst after discharge turned off.

(Resistances in ohms, tem- peratures in .) with higher resistance produced a larger AVexpti for equivalent activity, therefore more accurate values of yi. The slopes of the extrapolated lines indicate the drift in the detector due to ambient radiation changes. When the slope was large, so was the discrepancy between yi and yc. 2. Proportionality between Recombination Heat and Atom Concentration Experiments to test direct proportionality between recombination heat and atom con- centration according to Eq. (4) were per- formed on silver. The detector-to-orifice distance as well as the resistance R were kept constant throughout. Combining Eqs. (4) and (12) permits definition of a quan- tity V proportional to y which should have been constant during the experiments as- suming that y did not change with time. This is shown in Table 1.

Relation between Atom Recombination Heat and Detector-to-Orifice Distance Another set of experiments was carried out to determine whether the atom recom- bination heat varied with detector-to-ori- fice distance in the manner predicted by the theory of effusion. The detector was again coated with silver. The recombina- tion heat was measured isothermally. The results according to Eq. (13) are shown in Fig. 7 (a). The detector-to-orifice distance was varied between 0.93 and 2.03 cm, cor- responding to extreme values of 6m of about 48and 24 It was not possible to alter the detector-to-orifice distance and then simply remeasure 7, because the amount of background radiation falling on the de- tector changed as well when the detector was moved. Thus every point of Fig. 7 (a) represents an individual experiment under equilibrium conditions. The good straight line of the figure has a slope of 0.80 (= yi). It was observed after the experiment upon removal of the film that the film had be- gun to peel, because the experiments were made before the evaporation technique had been perfected. There was also evidence of a bluish-white deposit which may have been an oxidized impurity originally intro- duced into the film during its deposition. That y for silver in this case was about treble the activity shown by all other silver films was attributed either to the increased surface area or to the impurity. Peeling of the film was not observed subsequent to these experiments. Two other sets of experiments were per- formed varying the detector-to-orifice dis- tance, again with silver as the catalyst. In one case the heat was measured isother- mally, and in the other by the cooling curve method. These results are shown in Fig. 7(b). That the lines did not pass through the origin is attributable to a small amount of electrical pickup. In any case the results clearly demonstrate the soundness of the assumptions with respect to effusion. 4. Recombination of 0 Atoms on Silver Over half the experiments in the present investigation were done on silver. Disc tem- peratures were varied between room tem- perature and 100, and total pressure in Chamber I was in the range 0.65 X 10\"2 < P < 1.37 X lO-2 torr. The lowest measured mole percent of atoms was 29%, the high- est 58%. Most of the experiments were done with the plane of the detector 1.30 cm from the orifice; other distances used were between 0.73 cm and 2.08 cm. In all the experiments there was visual evidence of oxidation. Discs coated with silver, after exposure to 0 atoms, always showed sev- eral concentric sets of brilliantly colored iridescent rings centered on the effusion axis. Colors such as red, yellow, green, and blue gave a rainbow effect, presumably due to a thin oxide layer. The recombination efficiency was cal- culated by both the isothermal and cooling curve methods. Both gave similar results. In 45 of the 84 experiments on silver, values of both yi and yc were obtained. That there was no significant bias is clear because the average difference ^Syi yc was only 0.025 for these cases.

This scatter was presumably due to differences between films, such as adsorbed impurities, sintering effects, or uncertainties in the atom concentration. If, however, a set of experiments was carried out for the same film, and without changing the atom con- centration, the temperature effect and its size could be clearly demonstrated. Results for three such sets of experiments are given in Fig. 8. The Arrhenius lines drawn 1.6 1.5 1.4 1.3 1,2 1.1 10-7T - 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 FIG. 8. Arrhenius lines for recombination of 0 atoms on silver. Figure shows data for three sets of experiments on three different films. Activation energies are (top to bottom) 740, 1140, and 1180 cal/mole. through each of these sets corresponded to activation energies of 740, 1140, and 1180 cal/mole (top, middle, and lowest curve in that order), or an average of 1020 cal/mole for the three lines. It was sometimes noted that on a new silver film values of 7 in a set of measure- ments tended to increase a little with total time of exposure. The differences were small and not always observed. Myerson (36) has reported the same effect for 0 atoms on silver. He observed that silver reached its maximum activity after a very short exposure to atoms. Strutt (37) has also commented on this effect. ATOM RECOMBINATION AT SURFACES 335 8. Recombination of 0 atoms on Copper Experiments on copper were again con- fined to a small pressure range, 8.35 X 10'3 < P< 1.19 X 10\"2 torr. The temperature range was between room temperature and 100. The concentration of atoms varied between 21% and 59% of total gas. Only Ye was measured and it appeared to be more variable on copper than on silver films. This may be due to the smaller re- combination heat on copper being more To \"2.8 Logo yc 1/T x 103 FIG. 9.

The metal became discolored by a thin golden-brown coating, and on one occasion, with the largest atom concentrations, a multicolored oxide film was produced, brownish yellow in the cen- ter passing through blue to red at the perimeter. All the values obtained for 70 on copper are shown in the Arrhenius plot of Fig. 9. A least-squares treatment of the points gave the equation 'y(copper) = (0.9 2.4) exp - [(1600 1100)/] The central values in the equation give a value for 7 (copper) at 300 of 6.3 X 10-2, a factor of 3 smaller than silver. The experiments on copper included several checks that the recombination heat de- creased with increasing detector-to-orifice distance, but there was considerable scat- ter. 6. Experiments on Gold and Chromium Only four measurements were made of y (gold). The results were uncertain because the efficiency was so small. A detector of low resistance (about 33 ohms) was used to increase the sensitivity so that yc could be measured. The average of two values for yo at 32 was 6.1 X 10-3, and of two values at 74 was 1.2 X 10~2, equivalent to an activation energy of 3 2 kcal/mole. These values should be taken as upper limits of y. There was no evidence of oxi- dation of the film. The results for chromium were unfortu- nately widely spread because the pressures were low, 7.8 X 10-3 < P < 1.06 X 10-2 torr. Also, lower atom concentrations than in the other experiments were recorded, be- tween 17% and 25% of total gas. The situa- tion was aggravated by the low activity of the films. Fifteen measurements were made altogether, between 35and 83. The values of yc were so scattered that we only report the mean value of all the experi- ments of y (chromium) = 6 4 X lO\"2. One set of experiments showed a tempera- ture coefficient corresponding to about 1 kcal/mole, though in general the results showed too much scatter to be certain of a temperature effect. Some of the chromium films did not show oxidation, but one did after long exposure to atoms. The oxide film was an iridescent sky-blue color, and developed after over 7 hr of continuous operation. With the assumption that the recombina- tion efficiency can be expressed 7=7exp {-E/RT} (14) the results of the present work are sum- marized in Table 2. 7.

Linnett and Marsden (10) showed that introduction of some of it into a manga- nous solution produced the purple colora- tion of the permanganate ion, showing that it was a powerful oxidant. The exact na- ture of the oxide had not been determined. We have investigated some of its proper- ties. The reaction of oxygen atoms from the discharge with silver foil under two sets of conditions led to two different oxide coatings. With the pressure less than 2 X 10\"2 torr and the foil placed outside but near the plasma and exposed about 8 hr, the foil became covered with a loosely held layer of shiny black oxide. The yield was about 1.5 mg/sq. cm at an atom concen- tration of 80% or more. In the early stages of oxidation the foil exhibited multicolored patterns of oxide over the whole spectrum of colors, in a fashion similar to those ob- served at the detector disc after 0 atoms had been recombined on a silver film. In an effort to increase the yield the foil was placed inside the plasma and the pressure raised to 5 X 10'2 torr. In this case the oxide was formed in two layers, a thin black layer on top of a thick dark brown sublayer. The yield did not increase sig- nificantly. The black oxide showed oxidizing power. Any touching the fingers released a strong smell of ozone. A few mg in a mixture of 10 ml of 3 M Kl solution, 2 drops of cone. H;S04, and 2 ml of CCLproduced a purple color in the CCli after 10-fold dilu- tion and addition of dilute silver nitrate to destroy triiodide. Two separately prepared samples of the fresh black oxide (A and B) and one 6- week-old sample (C) were chemically ana- lyzed, as well as a sample of the brown oxide (D). A modified method of analysis due to Palmer was used (38). The weighed oxide was reduced with standard oxalic acid and the excess determined with stand- ard KMn04 solution. Total silver was ob- tained by a Volhard titration (Table 3). The brown-black oxide might be written AgO-AgzO. Somewhat low assays for sil- ver (II) or its equivalent may be expected using this method of analysis (39). The fresh oxide was evidently AgO. The old sample (C) showed evidence of some de- composition, but the analysis was doubtful because the sample was very small. Two other tests were made of the black oxide. X-Ray powder diffraction photo- graphs were taken from two separate freshly prepared samples. The reflections agreed very well with the monoclinic spac- ings that have been assigned to AgO (40- 42). We are most grateful to Mr. K.

Day on a Faraday balance as +0-37 X 10\"8 emu/g, in fair agreement with Klemm (43) but not with other authors (41, 44, 4S). At sufficiently low pressures, then, and when bulk oxide is formed, we conclude that it is AgO. At higher pressures a mix- ture of AgO and AgzO is very likely pro- duced. IV. DISCUSSION The present experiments demonstrate that an effusion technique is feasible and that it also offers an independent check of methods based upon diffusion. This can be seen from Table 4, where we have com- TABLE 4 RECOMBINATION OF 0 ATOMS AT ROOM TEMPERATURE Metal or Oxide surface T Reference Ag CuCuaO CuOOr CrzOsAu 0.24 0.15 0.220.17 0.15 0.0630.110.043 0.020 0.045~0.06 0.000250.0052 0.0061 12 SS This paperIS SS This paperIS IS 16This paper 13IS This paper pared the present results with previous data for Ag, Cu, Au, Cr, and their oxides. The effusion results compare favorably with the others in the table. Because 0 atoms attack metals so readily, the study of their recombination at an unoxidized metal surface is probably impossible in most cases. After exposure to 0 atoms, most clean metals will rapidly become covered with an oxide layer which may or may not have the same catalytic activity as the virgin surface. In the case of silver there is evidence that the oxide is more active than the metal (86, S7), but for copper and chromium the reverse seems to be the case. There are other examples of such effects. For instance, Linnett and Marsden (11) found that activities of Pd and Pt foils for recombining 0 atoms de- creased with time, and Fryberg and Petrus (45) attributed variability of Pt for 0 atom recombination to surface oxidation. Two main mechanisms are available for atom recombination. They are (i) the re- combination of two adatoms represented by Eq. (15), or (ii) the combination of an adatom with one striking it from the gas phase, represented by Eq. (16). These are known as (i) the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism (LH) and (ii) the Bonhoeffer- Farkas-Rideal mechanism (BFR). A 2A-S -> 28 + A2 f = -Affads (15) AS + A 4 S + Ai f = -i- iAffad. (16) Affads refers to the differential heat of ad- sorption of the diatomic molecule at the equilibrium coverage during recombination. It is negative if the adsorption process is exothermic, which chemisorption of Oa has always been observed to be. D is the heat of dissociation of the diatomic molecule; it is positive. The rate constants of (15) and (16) are fcm and ka. Because for 02 Affads is ordinarily negative and D is positive, (16) may be either exothermic or endo- thermic depending on the coverage and the metal. At very high coverages, Affads usu- ally becomes small, and therefore Aff of (16) might approach the limiting value of D/2, hence it is very probable that this process is always exothermic between in- termediate and high values of the cover- age. For oxygen, however, Eq. (15) will usually be strongly endothermic and should only be possible at high temperatures. A complete kinetic treatment to permit decision on which of (15) or (16) is theo- retically rate-controlling has been given by Ehrlich (47) and extended by Dickens, 338 MAY AND LINNETT Linnett, and Palczewska (18}. The con- clusion is that near room temperature and at pressures not too low, the BFR, mech- anism (16) dominates, and the kinetics ill be unambiguously first order in 0 atoms. (In fact, at temperatures close to room temperature, first order kinetics have always been observed for recombination of either H or 0 atoms.) The reasonable as- sumptions on which Ehrlich (4-7) based his treatment are (a) atoms have unit sticking probability on unoccupied sites (this may not be quite the case but it should provide a fair approximation), (b) molecules have much lower sticking proba- bility, (c) the rate of evaporation of atoms as atoms is negligible. It may then be shown, if Es is the activation energy cor- responding to kd, that According to (18) the coverage 0 of catalytically active sites lies between the limits 0.5 and unity, depending on whether 2S*0*0 2S*0, so*s*o y is large or small. For this range of cov- erage we have already concluded that (16) is most probably always exothermic, so that one is tempted to apply Hirschfelder's Rule (48), which predicts an upper limit for Ei of 0.055 D = 6.5 kcal/mole for 0 atom recombination. Our present results are in agreement with this prediction, as are all other published data for recombina- tion of 0 atoms on metal surfaces. Appli- cation of (19) using our room temperature values of y and the experimental activa- tion energies at 300, gives J?a = 0.8 kcal/mole for silver and 1.7 kcal/mole for copper. It is interesting to compare energies for processes occurring at the surface during atom recombination. This is done in Fig. 10. In the figure Affatom represents the bond energy with the surface of adsorbed atoms, and other symbols have the same meanings as before. Three cases are considered, (a) Affads is exothermic and Affatom < D; (b) f ads is exothermic and Affatom > D; (c) Affads is endothermic and Affatom < V2 D. The first of these (a) applies to silver and copper, the second (b) to tungsten (4S) and possibly to chromium, and the third (c) applies to gold.

ATOM RECOMBINATION AT SURFACES 339 case (c) (16) is more exothermic than y-sD. For case (b) reaction (16) is pre- dicted to be endothermic by an amount less than % D, or in other words, recom- bination of 0 atoms in a primary adsorbed layer will not be expected to proceed spon- taneously, although recombination via a second adiayer, adsorbed above a strongly held primary layer, cannot be ruled out. In that event, however, the situation would be formally analogous to case (a). The foregoing analysis can be applied when we consider how much energy is lib- erated in the rate-controlling step (16). Wood, Mills, and Wise (7) have reported that H2 molecules, formed by the catalyzed recombination of H atoms on surfaces of Ni, W, or Pt, leave the surface with excess vibrational energy so that energy transfer to the surface is incomplete. They report that as little as 0.2 of the dissociation en- ergy of H2 is transferred to the solid dur- ing recombination. In view of the fact that recombination of atoms by the BFR mech- anism is a two-step process, and that chemi- sorption of H2 on all three of these metals is exothermic, case (a) of Fig. 10 must be operating. In other words, theory predicts a minimum of 0.5 D of heat liberated at the surface for each recombined molecule formed, and a maximum of 0.5 D that might escape in the newly formed molecule as excess kinetic or internal energy. It seems to us likely that only a small frac- tion of this maximum energy could be carried away in the case of 0 atom re- combination, and that for H atom recom- bination the results of Wood, Mills, and Wise (7) are extremely difficult to under- stand. Further support for this comes from the experiments of Larkin and Thrush (SO), who concluded that after atom recombina- tion, molecules of 02, H2, or N2 leave sur- faces of Ag, Cu, Ni, or Pt with an average of not more than twice the thermal velocity corresponding to the suface temperature. This last result is of considerable im- portance for the present method. If some excess energy is carried away by 02 mole- cules formed according to reaction (16), values of y obtained in this work might conceivably be too low, but not by more than a factor of 2. We believe thermal ac- commodation at the surface of newly formed 02 molecules to be essentially com- plete. It has been claimed by Reeves, Man- nella, and Harteck (51) that combination of atoms at surfaces can lead to the forma- tion of electronically excited molecules. This was not observed by them for 0 atoms alone, but was for N atom recombination, and also when both N and 0 atoms were present. In the latter case excited NO was observed. In our view it is very unlikely that in the present experiments electroni- cally excited Oa molecules could leave the strong perturbation field of the surface, because only ground state 3? 0 atoms are present in the type of discharge used by us (10,11,19,52). We have so far concluded that the heat of association measured in these experi- ments has not been appreciably decreased by the carrying away of excess kinetic en- ergy nor by the formation of electronically excited 02 molecules. We must still con- sider the possibility of extra heat being released to the surface by vibrationally excited or electronically excited molecules from the discharge. Such molecules would, on average, make a great number of colli- sions with the walls of Chamber I (Fig. 1) before reaching the detector face. It seems reasonable to assume that by the time such molecules reached the catalyst surface they would have become de-excited if such transitions were not forbidden. If they are forbidden, it seems unlikely that appreciable deexcitation should then occur on the catalyst surface. We must, how- ever, point out evidence for the existence of such excited molecules (53-56). Foner and Hudson (55) and Elias, Ogryzlo, and Schiff (86) inferred the presence, in the products of an oxygen discharge, of the long lived l^.g state, which is 22.6 kcal/ mole above the ground state. The latter au- thors, using a calorimetric probe in a flow system, showed that considerable heat was liberated at the probe after the discharge products had been first passed over a mir- ror of mercury, which removed all 0 atoms from the stream. Yet, because of the excel- 340 MAY AND LINNETT lent agreement of the present results with other methods which are independent of heat transfer to the surface and on the basis of the agreement presented at the be- ginning of this paragraph, we believe that excited molecules did not significantly af- fect the present results. One last source of extra heat remains. Not all the atoms arriving at the surface are combined into Oa molecules. Some are incorporated into the metal surface as oxide, releasing heat in the process, but the chance of this happening is small. For ex- ample, the observed rate of formation of AgO was 0.2 mg/cm2 per hr at 10~2 torr and 80% atomic gas. From this the chance of an 0 atom being permanently held as AgO after arrival at a silver surface can be calculated as about 6 X 10~5. In other words, it is about 4000 times more prob- able that an 0 atom is recombined to give Oa than that it is incorporated to form AgO at room temperature. We conclude this discussion with the comment that a possible BFE. mechanism on either silver or copper might be con- ceived as proceeding in a thin oxide film possessing higher and lower oxidation states (11, 13, 36). If both divalent and mono- valent metal ions are in the surface, the mechanism might be expressed by the fol- lowing equations: MaO + 0 -^ 2 MO .... fast 2 MO + O -> MsO +0a .... slow This is a more complex picture than was put forward earlier in this discussion, but may well be an important feature of 0 atom recombination on transition metal surfaces.

Linnett a † a From the Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory, Oxford University, Oxford, England ∗ Department of Engineering Physics, Cornell University Ithaca, New York U.S.A. † Professor of Physical Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England Recombination of O atoms on evaporated films of Ag, Cu, Au, and Cr was studied by an effusion method. Recombination efficiencies derived from measurements of heat liberated at the surface are in substantial agreement with other methods. The chance γ that an O atom colliding with the surface leaves as part of an O2 molecule was measured for Ag and Cu films in the temperature range 300–375 °K. For silver, γ Ag = 0.75 exp( −720 RT ) and for copper, γ Cu = 0.9 exp( −1600 RT ). For gold γ Au was 6 × 10−3 at 305 °K and 12 × 10−3 at 347 °K. Chromium films gave erratic results. Films of Ag reacted with O atoms to produce AgO, and those of copper and chromium showed evidence of oxidation also. Films of Au were not tarnished by atomic O. References 1. K. Nakada S. Sato S.
