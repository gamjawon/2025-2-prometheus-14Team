Direct Vapor-Phase Synthesis of Indole: Effect of MgO on the Performance of Cu/SiO 2 Catalyst LIU Jing, LI Chunmei, HUO Xiaomin, SHI Lei*, SUN Qi Institute of Chemistry for Functionalized Materials, Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian 116029, Liaoning, China Abstract: Magnesia was used as the promoter in the Cu/SiO 2 catalyst for direct vapor-phase synthesis of indole from aniline and ethylene glycol. The catalyst was characterized by XRD, H 2 -TPR, and TG. The results showed that a suitable amount of MgO (i.e., 0.17 mmol/g) remarkably increased the stability and activity of the catalyst. The MgO additive improved the dispersion of copper phases on the silica and prevented them from sintering in the reaction process. There existed an interaction between CuO and MgO, which inhibited the sintering of copper. The MgO promoter could suppress the coking of this copper-based catalyst. Key words: magnesia; promoter; copper; silica; supported catalyst; indole; aniline; ethylene glycol For several years, indole and its derivatives have received considerable attention owing to their potential applications in medicine, agriculture, industry, etc. [1–3]. To date, numerous synthetic routes have been developed for the synthesis of in- dole [4]. Among them, direct vapor-phase synthesis of indole with inexpensive reactants (e.g., aniline and ethylene glycol) has been considered a promising route because of its high efficiency, relatively low reaction temperature (453–623 K), and facile operation process [5]. The reaction is as follows: Although several catalysts have been investigated for the direct vapor-phase synthesis of indole for more than two dec- ades, few can be used in industrial processes because of the low yield of indole or their severe toxicity [6,7]. Among all kinds of catalysts, the silver-based catalyst prepared by the co-precipita- tion method is regarded as a good catalyst because the yield of indole can be up to 78% [8]. However, the catalyst is expen- sive, and the preparation method of the catalyst is complicated, and therefore the further development is limited. As a cheaper catalyst, Cu/SiO 2 has been widely used in various catalytic reactions [9–11]. Recently, the Cu/SiO 2 catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness method was used in the direct vapor- phase synthesis of indole from aniline and ethylene glycol, and an indole yield of ca. 88% was obtained [12]. However, the Cu/SiO 2 catalyst showed poor stability and was deactivated rapidly with time on stream [13], which prevented the further development and its application. In this study, we primarily report that the stability and ac- tivity of the Cu/SiO 2 catalyst can be availably increased by employing a MgO promoter. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction with H 2 (H 2 - TPR), and thermogravimetry (TG) were used to investigate and explain the relation between the structure of Cu/SiO 2 -MgO and its catalytic performance in the direct vapor-phase synthesis of indole. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation Cu/SiO 2 -MgO catalysts were prepared by sequential im- pregnation. First, SiO 2 with 310 m 2 /g and 20–40 mesh was pre-impregnated with an aqueous solution of copper nitrate for 24 h, dried at 393 K for 4 h, and calcined at 773 K in air for 4 h to obtain CuO/SiO 2 . To prepare CuO/SiO 2 -MgO samples, CuO/SiO 2 was impregnated with an aqueous solution of mag- nesium nitrate for 24 h and then dried and calcined as de- scribed above. Prior to the activity evaluations, 3 ml catalyst LIU Jing et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(2): 159–162 sample was reduced under a gas mixture composed of 50% H 2 /N 2 at 423 K for 3 h, then heated to 598 K at a ramping rate of 6 K/min, and held at 598 K for 0.5 h. The loading of active component copper on the unit mass support was 0.68 mmol/g, and the amount of the MgO promoter was 0.04, 0.17, 0.34, and 0.51 mmol/g, respectively. 1.2 Catalytic activity testing The catalytic reactions were carried out in a fixed-bed con- tinuous flow glass reactor with an inside diameter of 12 mm under normal atmospheric pressure. The reactor was placed vertically inside a tubular furnace and heated electrically. The reactor temperature was monitored by a thermocouple with its tip located at the catalyst bed and connected to a temperature indicator controller. The mixture of reactants (aniline/ethylene glycol molar ratio = 7:1, LHSV = 0.4 h –1 , SV = 1635 h –1 ) was pumped through the preheater, where they were vaporized and then entered the reactor together with H 2 and N 2 . The reaction was performed at 598 K. The products were analyzed by an SP-6800A gas chromatograph using an OV-17 column. The yield of indole was calculated based on the conversion of eth- ylene glycol. 1.3 Catalyst characterization XRD patterns were recorded using a Rigaku D/Max 2400 diffractometer with Cu K α radiation source at a radiation rate of 0.06º/min in the 2θ range of 30º–60º. The voltage and current were 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. H 2 -TPR experiments were carried out in a quartz reactor with an inside diameter of 6 mm and length of 350 mm. A 100 mg sample was pretreated in a flow of ultrapure nitrogen gas of 50 ml/min at 473 K for 1 h. After the sample was cooled to 323 K, the reduction gas of 10% H 2 /Ar (30 ml/min) was fed into the reactor, and the temperature was linearly increased to 773 K at a heating rate of 10 K/min. The hydrogen consumption was recorded with a thermal conductivity detector. TG analysis was carried out with a TG/DTA 6300 apparatus to test the coking of the catalyst. About 7 mg of the catalyst sample was placed in a pan. The sample was first blown in ultrapure nitrogen (20 ml/min) from room temperature to 573 K at a heating rate of 10 K/min to remove the physisorbed materials. After cooling to 323 K, it was heated in streaming air (20 ml/min) to 1073 K at a heating rate of 10 K/min. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Effect of MgO promoter on the catalytic performance The effect of MgO amounts on the activity of Cu/SiO 2 -MgO catalysts for the direct vapor-phase synthesis of indole from aniline and ethylene glycol is listed in Table 1. The results showed that the yields of indole obtained by Cu/SiO 2 -MgO catalysts were higher than that of the Cu/SiO 2 catalyst, which indicated that the addition of the MgO promoter is favorable for the indole production. When the MgO amount was 0.17 mmol/g, the yield of indole reached 94%, which is considera- bly higher than the results of the silver-based catalyst and the Cu/SiO 2 catalyst under the same reaction conditions [8,12]. Table 1 Effect of MgO amounts on the activity of Cu/SiO 2 catalyst samples MgO amount (mmol/g) Conversion of ethylene glycol (%) Indole yield (%) 0 100 88 0.04 100 89 0.17 100 94 0.34 100 92 0.51 100 90 Reaction conditions: catalyst volume = 3 ml, n(aniline)/n(ethylene gly- col) = 7, temperature = 598 K, LHSV = 0.4 h –1 , SV = 1635 h –1 , time on stream = 2 h. Fig. 1 shows the indole yield versus reaction time over the copper-based catalysts when adding the MgO promoter into Cu/SiO 2 for the direct vapor-phase synthesis of indole from aniline and ethylene glycol. The yield of indole decreased rapidly from 88% to 70% over the Cu/SiO 2 catalyst within 6 h, whereas the yield of indole decreased only from 94% to 91% over the Cu/SiO 2 -MgO catalyst (the MgO amount of 0.17 mmol/g). These results indicate that the addition of a suitable amount of the MgO promoter can remarkably inhibit the de- activation of the Cu/SiO 2 catalyst. Fig. 1 Comparison of indole yield for direct vapor-phase synthesis from aniline and ethylene glycol over Cu-based catalysts (1) Cu/SiO 2 , (2) Cu/SiO 2 -MgO with 0.68 mmol/g Cu and 0.17 mmol/g MgO 2.2 Catalyst characterization Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of Cu/SiO 2 -MgO with dif- ferent MgO amounts. It can be seen that the addition of MgO decreased the diffraction peak intensity of Cu(111) and (200). LIU Jing et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(2): 159–162 When the MgO amount is 0.17 mmol/g, the copper diffraction peak intensity is the weakest. Here, the average copper particle size calculated by the Scherrer equation is ca. 16 nm, which is far smaller than that of Cu/SiO 2 (ca. 25 nm). This indicates that the addition of a proper amount of the MgO promoter can improve the dispersion of copper particles and efficiently sup- press the sintering of copper particles. Fig. 2 XRD patterns of Cu/SiO 2 -MgO catalysts with different MgO amounts MgO amount (mmol/g): (1) 0, (2) 0.04, (3) 0.17, (4) 0.34, (5) 0.51 Fig. 3 presents the XRD patterns of the Cu/SiO 2 and Cu/SiO 2 -MgO catalysts before and after reaction with a MgO amount of 0.17 mmol/g. It can be seen that the intensity of the copper diffraction peaks of Cu/SiO 2 after reaction distinctly increased, which indicated that active component Cu aggre- gated and copper particles grew up without the MgO promoter, whereas the intensity of copper diffraction peaks of the Cu/SiO 2 -MgO catalyst was only slightly changed. This sug- gests that the addition of a proper amount MgO into the Cu/SiO 2 catalyst can suppress the sintering of copper particles during the reaction. To further elucidate the effect of MgO on the dispersion of copper particles, SiO 2 -MgO (MgO amount of 0.17 mmol/g) and CuO/SiO 2 -MgO samples with different MgO amounts were investigated by TPR (Fig. 4). No reduction peak was found for the SiO 2 -MgO sample (Fig. 4(1)), which indicated that MgO cannot be reduced in the temperature range of 323–773 K. The CuO/SiO 2 sample (Fig. 4(2)) showed a broad reduction peak at 534 K and a shoulder peak at ca. 500 K. In the case of the CuO/SiO 2 -MgO samples (Figs. 4(3–6)), two re- duction peaks were clearly observed, and the CuO reduction temperature shifted to higher temperature with increasing MgO amount. Besides, the intensity ratio of the low-tem- perature reduction peak to the high-temperature peak increased with the MgO amount and went through a maximum at 0.17 mmol/g of MgO, and then it decreased with further increase in the amount of MgO. Fig. 4 TPR profiles of SiO 2 -MgO with the MgO amount of 0.17 mmol/g (1) and CuO/SiO 2 -MgO samples with MgO amounts of 0 (2), 0.04 (3), 0.17 (4), 0.34 (5), and 0.51 mmol/g (6) Generally, there are two reduction peaks for CuO. The re- duction peak at low temperature is assigned to small particles, and the reduction peak at high temperature is assigned to large particles [10,15]. Therefore, it can be proposed that bimodal distribution of the CuO/SiO 2 -MgO catalyst contributes to the bimodal distribution of CuO particles over the silica support. The reduction peak at lower temperature can be attributed to the reduction of smaller CuO particles, while that at higher temperature can be related to the reduction of the larger ones. Fig. 3 XRD patterns of Cu/SiO 2 and Cu/SiO 2 -MgO catalysts before and after reaction for 6 h (1) Cu/SiO 2 before reaction, (2) Cu/SiO 2 after reaction, (3) Cu/SiO 2 -MgO before reaction, (4) Cu/SiO 2 -MgO after reaction LIU Jing et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(2): 159–162 When the amount of MgO was 0.17 mmol/g, the intensity ratio of the low-temperature reduction peak to the high-tem- perature peak reached a maximum, suggesting that smaller copper nanoparticles were formed, which is consistent with the XRD results. Besides, the reduction peaks shifted to higher temperature with the increase in the MgO amount. This sug- gests that there existed an interaction between CuO and MgO, which made the reduction of CuO difficult [16]. The more the MgO amount, the stronger the interaction, and thus the more difficult the CuO reduction. Many investigations showed that coking on the catalyst surface during the reaction is also the main reason for the de- activation of the catalyst [17,18]. Fig. 5 shows the results of TG analysis of the fresh and used Cu/SiO 2 and Cu/SiO 2 -MgO with a Cu loading of 0.68 mmol/g and a MgO amount of 0.17 mmol/g. It was observed that the weight loss of the used Cu/SiO 2 -MgO was ca. 3.85%, which is lower than that of the used Cu/SiO 2 (5.18%). These results reveal that the addition of MgO into the Cu/SiO 2 catalyst could suppress the coking of the catalysts. To sum up, the addition of a proper amount of MgO (0.17 mmol/g) can regulate the interaction between copper and the silica support, which can limit the size of copper nanoparticles and prevent them from sintering during the reaction. On the other hand, the MgO promoter can also suppress the coking of the catalysts. These two main contributions are probably re- lated to the higher stability of the Cu/SiO 2 -MgO catalyst during the direct vapor-phase synthesis of indole. 3 Conclusions For the direct vapor-phase synthesis of indole from aniline and ethylene glycol, the addition of a proper amount of MgO promoter can enhance the activity and the stability of the catalyst. When the MgO amount is 0.17 mmol/g, there exists an interaction between the MgO promoter and copper, which can improve the dispersion of copper particles over the silica support and prevent copper particles from sintering during the reaction. Besides, the MgO promoter can suppress the coking of the copper-based catalysts. References [1] Sundberg R J. In: Kroschwitz J I, Howe-Grant M eds. Kirk- Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology.
