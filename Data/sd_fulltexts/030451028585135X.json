JEZOWSKA-TRZEBIATOWSKA Institute of Chemistry, Wroctaw University, Wrocfaw (Poland) and W. OGANOWSKI Institute of Organic Chemistry, Department of Petrochemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw (Poland) (Received January 5, 1984; accepted April 12, 1984) Summary A mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation converting ethylbenzene to styrene on VzOg/MgO catalysts is suggested. The nature and structure of the V^/V^ active centres is discussed on the basis of the physicochemical (radio- graphic, thermogravimetric, electron microscopic, IR, RS, UV, VIS, ESR, luminescence and magnetic) properties. The V^V^/V111 redox system linked by oxygen bridges was shown to play an important role in the catalytic process. Introduction Metal oxides and oxy-compounds of vanadium and magnesium, and complex mixtures of both compounds, act as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene [1 - 3]. It was decided to study these catalyst systems in order to elucidate the correlation between their structures, physicochemical properties and catalytic activities. The V20s/MgO catalysts employed by us made it possible to carry out the dehydrogenation with high degrees of conversion, selectivity and yields, most certainly due to the specificity of the surface layer structure of these catalysts. Such a generalization was possible after performing chemical, X-ray, thermogravi- metric, electron microscopic, IR, Raman, UV + VIS, ESR, luminescence and magnetic studies on the catalysts used. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 110 Experimental VzOg catalysts containing from 2 to 14% by weight vanadium were synthesized by impregnating MgO with aqueous ammonium metavanadate solution, drying at 120 C for 16 h and calcining at 600 C for 4 h. Catalysts were reduced in a flow reactor by means of gaseous ethylbenzene diluted with nitrogen. Studies were also prepared on catalyst samples containing 10% vanadium which were calcined at 600 - 800 C and then employed for 200 h under the reaction conditions. A full description of the syntheses and activity determinations are provided in a separate paper [4]. The reaction conditions were as follows: reaction temperature 520 C, contact time 0.04 s, molar ratio of ethylbenzene to oxygen 1:2, and atmospheric pressure. The reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography. Vanadium(V) content was determined manganometrically, whereas the concentration of vanadium at lower oxidation states was determined by the iodometric method. DTA measurements were carried out in a MOM derivatograph (Paulik- Paulik-Erdey system) over the temperature range 20 - 1000 C. These studies were carried out on the catalysts, mixtures of MgO and V^O^, corresponding to the stoichiometric composition of magnesium vanadates MgO^O; 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 and 3:2, and on the vanadates prepared by this method: MgV^Oo, Mg^O^andMgaV^O,. X-ray studies were carried out in a DR.ON-3 unit using Cu Ky radiation, X = 1.5418 A. Microphotographs were taken on a Tesia BS 500 transmission electron microscope. Infrared spectra, measured between 50 and 4000 cn-T1, were obtained by the KBr and polyethylene disk method in a Perkin-Elmer 180 spectrophotom- eter. The spectra were also measured by means of the reference beam compensation technique, in which the bands resulting from MgO were com- pensated. Raman scattering and luminescence spectra were measured in a DFS 24 spectrophotometer. The 4880 and 5145 A lines were used with an input power of 500 mW. The UV-VIS diffuse reflectance spectra were measured in Cary 14 and Hitachi spectrophotometers using MgO and MgC03 as reference samples. Measurements of the ESR spectra were performed in a JEOL-ME spectrom- eter using Mn^/MgO as a standard of the static magnetic field. Quantitative measurements of V4\"1' contents and spin concentration were carried out by integrating the area under the absorption curve, which was determined by differentiating the ESR signal. Magnetic susceptibility studies over the 77 - 298 K range were carried out by the Gouy technique. An electronic Khan RH-2 microbalance and a magnetic field of 100 kGs were used. Ill Fig. 1.

Studies of the catalyst precursor revealed an exothermic effect at 615 C and endothermic effect at about 760 C. These effects correspond to the forma- tion and subsequent melting of the magnesium vanadate formed. Similar effects are also found in vanadate precursors. Apart from those described above, one can also observe a number of minor effects related to the decom- position of Mg(OH)2 and MgC03 formed temporarily on the catalyst surface and to the melting of V^O^. In general, it can be concluded from DTA measurements that during synthesis of the catalyst used later in the manufacture of styrene, a chemical compound magnesium vanadate is formed [5, 6]. Our studies do not confirm Speranskaya's [5] suggestion that the tetravanadate Mg3V40i3 is formed under the reaction conditions; according to our measurements, the ATA curve for that compound may be obtained by superimposing the curves describing the thermograms of MgV^O^ and Mg^V^O^. This conclusion is also confirmed by X-ray studies, which indicate clearly that Mg3V40i3 is an equimolar mixture of meta- and pyrovanadates. Because of a considerable dispersion and low V205 concentrations, X-ray studies of the catalysts with low vanadium contents did not lead to identification of the chemical compound being formed during synthesis of the catalyst. The reflections characteristic of magnesium orthovanadate became visible only for the catalyst containing 10% vanadium (Table 1, Fig. 2d). The orthovanadate phase appears in large quantities in catalyst samples containing more than 10% vanadium calcined at 800 C, and in catalysts used for 200 h. Quantitative estimations showed that most vanadium introduced into the catalyst occurs in these samples as Mg3(V04)2. In the reduced catalysts the orthovanadate phase disappears and no new phase becomes visible. The X-ray spectrum of pure magnesium orthovanadate, measured for comparison after reduction with ethylbenzene at 560 C, remains unchanged, indicating that solid Mg3(V04):2 is irreducible under the reaction conditions. The suggestion, based upon X-ray studies, that vanadium is highly dis- persed is supported by the photographs obtained in an electron microscope (Fig. 3). A comparison of pictures obtained for a freshly-prepared catalyst containing 10% vanadium, calcined at 600 and 800 C and after use, shows that the orthovanadate phase in the catalyst calcined at 600 C has the highest dispersion. The results of studies discussed thus far indicate that the active portion of the catalyst is highly-dispersed magnesium orthovanadate coordinated with the MgO surface. The structure and properties of that compound are different from those of solid Mg3(VC>4)2 since it can be reduced in gaseous ethylbenzene at as low as 400 C, whereas the solid compound is not reduced 113 TABLE 1 The identification of magnesium vanadates by X-ray analysis Mg(VC>3)2 Mg3V20g Mg2V207 Mg3V40l3a MgO Catalyst d~(K)T~ d~(K)T~ d~(K)T~ d(A) d~(K)T~ d(A) 6.19 30 5.71 10 4.78 45 6.19 5.71 4.78 4.50 4.29 85 4.50 25 4.63 10 4.63 3.37 12 3.37 10 4.23 8 4.29 3.37 4.15 3.28 3.22 12 3.28 75 4.15 12 4.06 3.12 45 3.03 35 4.06 14 3.71 3.03 3.51 3.01 3.05 100 3.01 65 3.81 8 3.37 2.86 2.905 4 2.86 30 3.71 40 3.23 2.680 3.12 2.712 18 2.680 6 3.31 60 3.11 2.546 3.05 2.313 6 2.546 100 3.23 45 3.02 2.494 2.302 8 2.494 40 3.11 100 2.947 2.464 2.90 2.189 16 2.464 20 3.02 80 2.752 2.42 6 2.42 2.169 12 2.355 8 2.947 16 2.712, 2.355 2.149 6 2.080 35 2.90 90 2.561 2.10 100 2.10 2.450 2.080 2.079 8 2.074 35 2.952 30 2.427 2.074 1.916 4 1.954 4 2.676 35 2.378 1.883 8 1.903 8 2.561 50 2.189 1.954 1.872 6 1.861 4 2.490 8 1.903 1.833 6 1.794 10 2.450 30 1.861 1.741 6 1.747 8 2.427 18 1.794 1.603 4 1.714 10 2.378 15 1.538 6 1.680 6 2.354 12 1.529 14 1.641 8 2.319 14 1.524 14 1.616 10 2.244 25 1.597 8 2.116 12 1.589 10 1.920 12 1.585 20 1.874 16 1.571 6 1.863 14 1.485 75 1.485 1.266 6 1.213 15 ^gVzOfi + Mg2V207. even at 560 C. Further conclusions on this problem are based on correlations between the activities, chemical compositions, yields and external conditions. The results of studies presented in Table 2 illustrate the dependence of catalyst activity on the vanadium content. For samples where the vanadium content varies from 2 to 8%, the yield of styrene increases from 18 to 56%. 114 Jim i II l|i ill 1,1 70 60 SO 10 o 26 Fig. 2.

Effect of vanadium content in the V^C^/MgO catalyst on the yield of CO;. A further increase in vanadium content up to 14% does not result in any change in catalyst activity, and the yield of styrene is maintained at about 57%. The degree of conversion and selectivity also increase initially with increasing vanadium content, and on exceeding 8% vanadium they remain unchanged at 66 and 86%, respectively. The dependence of C02 yield on vanadium content in the catalyst is shown in Fig. 4. The amount of CO^ decreases from about 13 to 9% with an increase in vanadium content from 2 to 14%. The effect of thermal treatment on the activities of catalysts is presented in Table 3. It can be seen that on increasing the temperature of calcination over the range 600 to 800 C, the yield of styrene decreases from 58.5 to 44% while the specific surface of the catalyst decreases from the initial value of 65.5 to 40 m2 g~1. The yield of styrene per m2 of the catalyst surface increases according to the data presented in Table 3. The catalyst calcined at 600 C for 200 h has the same activity as that calcined at 700 C, and has a comparable specific surface. On the other hand, the specific surface of catalyst after 200 h in use decreases to 19 m2 g~1 and the yield of styrene increases to 1.65 W m~2. These changes result from textural changes occur- ing under varying reaction conditions. The average oxidation state of vanadium in the reduced catalysts calcu- lated on the basic of chemical analyses is 3.6 - 3.9 (Table 4). For V^Os reduced under the same conditions it is 3.25. The reducibility of the catalysts increases with increasing vanadium content. The activity and amount of vanadium(IV) are correlated in a similar manner, as indicated by the curves in Fig. 5. 117 TABLE 3 Effect of calcination temperature of the V^C^/MgO catalyst on its activity and selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene; contact time 0.04 s; ethyl- benzene:02:H20:N2 = 1:1:8:20 molar ratio.

In Figs. 6 and 7, the IR and RS spectra of fresh and reduced catalysts as well as those ofvanadium(III), (IV) and (V) oxides are compared. Spectroscopic data obtained for VzO; and its reduction products, 'V^0^ and V203, may be compared with the results of spectral measurements for both fresh and reduced V^Os/MgO catalysts. It may be concluded from such a comparison that VzOg deposited on MgO loses its oxide nature. As a result of the chemical reaction at 400 - 600 C, a surface phase is formed which has the properties of a chemical compound. This indicates that there is no similarity between the spectra of catalysts and those of vanadium oxides mentioned above. Over the vanadium-oxygen stretching region the IR spectrum of a fresh catalyst consists of seven clearly separate bands situated at 956, 913, 870, 820, 763, 685 and 590 cnT1. The RS spectrum in this region contains six lines of the following energies: 999, 940, 868, 834, 768 and 532 cm\"1. Thus, one can observe considerably enriched spectral contours for which neither the number of bands nor the energy distribution parallels that of the spectrum of V^Og. 119 Fig. 6.

Raman scattering spectra of vanadium oxides compared with that of vanadate catalysts. A change of the vanadium content in the catalyst from 2 to 14% does not affect the band distribution, but only the band intensity with respect to strong absorption associated with the carrier. The surface phase band distributions for the catalyst seemed to be similar to those of the vanadate spectra, known for many years and documented by Baran et al. [7], Griffith et al. [8], Brown and Ross [9], Weinstock et al. [10] and Schwendt and Grans [11]. In order to determine the composition of the surface layer and to assign the spectral contour to a specific structure, we have carried out 121 comparative spectroscopic studies of the magnesium vanadates MgY^Og, MgzV207 and MgyV^Os. Their IR and RS spectra are illustrated in Figs. 8 and 9, and the frequencies, relative band intensities and assignments are pre- sented in Tables 5 and 6. The spectra of fresh catalysts are very similar to those of magnesium orthovanadate. Over the stretching frequency region from 500 to 1000 cm\"* these similarities are considerable, both with respect to the transition energies and their intensities. Over the FIR region the bands are distorted by MgO absorption and, therefore, this similarity becomes less pronounced. The highest energy band of the multiplet is much stronger than the diphon 230 400 BOO 600 moo Fig. 8.

Raman scattering spectra of vanadates formed in the V^Og/MgO binary system. absorption found for magnesium orthovanadate at 962 cm~1 (Fig. 8). The origin of that transition is thus attributed to ^(V^O) vibrations of the second surface layer component. This component is most probably the system of octahedral active centres, forming, with a tetrahedral framework, a spinel-type lattice of the surface layer. Certain differences in the spectra of catalysts and orthovanadate are revealed in the Raman scattering spectra. Apart from the bands characteristic of Mgy(VO^)^ these spectra also contain new bands at 999,940 and 768 cm~1, which correspond most probably to ^(V^O), ^(V^^O) and ras(VOV) vibrations of the octahedral component in the surface layer. Our studies do not support the thesis suggested by Speranskaya [5] on the existence of the Mg3V40i3 vanadate formed from the binary 3MgO X 2Vz05 phase. The IR spectral contour of that compound (Fig. 8) indicates clearly that, in fact, we are dealing with a mixture of divanadate and meta- vanadate. Reduction of the catalyst brings about pronounced changes in its vibrational spectra and leads to the decline of the 910 - 1000 cm~1 bands. Since these bands are related to the vanadium(V)-oxygen stretching frequencies, this fact indicates that during reduction V(V) undergoes con- version to lower oxidation states.

A broad absorption between 800 and 910 cm~1 contains the bands corresponding to the vanadyl bond ^(V^^O) in the square pyramid complex and to asymmetric vibrations of the vanadium(IV) and (III) VOV bridges. Diffuse reflectance spectra Diffuse reflectance spectra measured in the present work are presented in Figs. 10 and 11 and Tables 7 and 8. UV-VIS spectra of freshly-prepared catalysts exhibit considerable differences in the band intensities of the red and blue spectral regions. Absorptions over the 9000 - 22000 cm\"1 range are almost 10 times weaker than those in the 22 000 - 48 000 cm~i region. These differences result from the different natures of the electron transitions which become activated in both energy regions. CT transitions of the vanadium(V) oxy-species lead to a spectral contour consisting of 3 - 5 bands whose centres of gravity occur at about 47 000, 42 000, 37 000, 30 000 and 25000 cm\"1. The strongest bands, at 30000 and 37000 - 40000 cm\"1, correspond to (7r)ti -> d(e) and {iT)t^ -> d(e) transitions of the tetrahedral com- ponent of the surface layer. The lower intensity bands of that region are con- nected with the second component of the surface layer possessing octahedral structure. The discussion of the electron spectra for that element may be referred to the energy diagram (Fig. 12) constructed by the method employed by Ballhausen and Gray for vanadyl complexes [12]. The bands found at 42 000 and 47 000 cm~1 are in agreement with the energy difference between the e level of oxygen and b2 level of vanadium(V). The LCT bands at 25 000 cm~1 according to So and Pope [13] correspond to the bi(7r) - h^(xy) transition. The optical spectra of the catalysts in the 11 000 - 21 000 cm\"1 range are characterized by three d-d transitions of vanadium(IV). The first band, bi - e*, lies in the 12 500 - 13 400 range, the second b^ -\" b? in the 15 600 - 16200 and third b;,--at in the 18500 - 21400 cm~1 range. Energies and intensities of these bands are typical of the vanadyl chromophore coordinated in the square pyramid complex structure [14]. These ions occur both in freshly-prepared catalysts and in the vanadium pentoxide used in their synthesis, where they result from structural defects, so-called deficiency oxygen holes. Some vanadyl centres occur also in vanadates, as indicated from the presence of the corresponding bands in the spectra presented in Fig. 11. The effect of catalyst lattice defects is of considerable importance, since the initial number of vanadyl centres determines catalyst activity in the transformation of ethylbenzene into styrene. The reduction process changes the spectrum of the catalyst considerably (Fig. 10). The maximum absorption of reduced catalysts occurs at 44000 cmr1 and other weaker bands occur at 41000, 35000 and 47600 cm\"1. A shift of the absorption maximum towards the UV region, as well as a considerable increase in the LCT transition energy from 25000 to 35000 126 Fig. 10.

Further- more, the reduction process leads to the complete decline of vanadium(V) to lower oxidation states. Spectra of the V205/MgO catalyst show weak near-infrared bands at 9900 - 10100 cm~1. A weak absorption in that region found for MnV^Vi^f^g8\" by So and Pope [13] was explained as the intervalence charge-transfer transition.

MO energy levels for VOOg centrum in VaOs/MgO catalyst, where 0' represents the oxygen bridge. is supported by the fact that reduction of catalysts in which the vanadium(V) disappears leads to a decline in this absorption. The IR absorption region (4000 - 7000 cm~1) in the spectra of precur- sors and reduced catalysts exhibits weak bands characteristic of the two- and three-phonon vibrational transitions. These bands are found in all samples at 4240, 4350, 5250, 7240 and 7330 cm-1, and also in those which were kept for long times at elevated temperatures, though in this case the 131 bands are much weaker. These bands result most probably from the aquo- and hydroxy groups occurring on the catalyst surface as products of the oxidative dehydrogenation. The spectral contour of the catalyst reduced for 5 - 6 h at the reaction temperature and also at 500 C is similar to that presented in Fig. 10. The difference consists of two additional bands, a shoulder at about 25 000 cm\"' and a very clear band at about 16300 cm\"1. These additional absorptions correspond most probably to the d-d transitions of the vanadium(III) ions. The electronic spectra of the octahedrally-coordinated V(III) ion should consist of three spin-allowed d-d transitions [15 -17]. These can be assigned in terms of the Q^ nomenclature as v^. ^(F) - ^g; v^. ^(F) -^ ^^(P) and VT,: ^^(F) -> ^A^. The two lowest spin-allowed y; and v^ transitions for the VOfi chromophore appear at 17 500 and 25 000 cm\"1. The third spin-allowed band is expected to occur in the 30 000 - 40 000 cm\"1 region and is usually obscured by CT bands [15]. These two additional absorptions found in the spectra of catalysts operating for more than 5 h indicate deep reduction in the catalysts, and the V(III) ions most probably represent the final stage of the process. Luminescence spectra The mechanism of the luminescence transitions for the tetra- oxovanadium(v) ions is attributed to the emission from the lowest excited 3^^ (ti -> 2e) state to the 'Ai ground state. In view of the small energy differ- ence between the 3^^ and ^2, it is expected that at higher temperatures the 3^ i level also plays a significant role in the luminescence process [18]. The luminescence mecha:iism described may be applied to the 'V^Os/MgO catalysts, since it is also based upon charge-transfer transitions. The emission spectra of the catalysts and above-mentioned vanadates, measured by us at 21000 19 coo f7000 15.COO c\"'1 Fig. 13. Luminescence spectrum of vanadium(V) in V^Os/MgO catalysts. 132 77 K (Fig. 13) consist of single broad bands whose maxima occur at 17 400 cm\"' (575 nm). The nature of that transition may be explained in terms of ^i (t^->2e)-> 'A; emission, similar to the case of Mg3(VC>4)2 vanadate [18]. It is essential that the catalyst luminescence disappears on reduction and reappears after reoxidation. This is related to a change in the oxidation state of the luminescence centres. ESR spectra The ESR spectra of solid VzOs, fresh catalysts and reduced samples, recorded at 20 C, are shown in Fig. 14. The ESR spectrum of the V4\"1\" ion in V^Og shows a signal typical of amorphous samples with non-isolated paramagnetic centres. The {g) values, g\\\\ = 1.88 and g^ = 1.99, give a mean value of l/3(^n + 2gy} equal to 1.96, which is almost equal to that of the catalysts under investigation. The V4'*\" ion concentration in V^Os does not exceed 4 X 1019 spin g~1. Reduction of VzOs in ethylbenzene vapour in an oxygen-free atmosphere leads to the decay of this signal, indicating a more advanced reduction to a lower oxidation state vanadium(III), since in the d2 electron structure this ion gives no ESR signal at room temperatures. The ESR spectra of fresh and reduced V205/MgO catalysts (Fig. 14) consist of well-resolved hyperfine lines due to interaction between the unpaired electron and the \"V nucleus with Az > A^- = Ay and gz< gx = gy No splitting of the x and y features was found. The parameters obtained from the spectra are listed in Table 9. These data may be used in the second- order perturbation theory [19,20] to estimate electron delocalization and covalency. Experimental and calculated ESR parameters are listed in Table 9, while Table 10 presents a comparison of some spin-Hamiltonian constants for the V02\"1\" ions in different tetrahedral and octahedral lattices. It can be seen from Table 10 that the parameters obtained in the present study are nearly equal to those reported for other V0 complexes with oxygen donor ligands [21 -27]. The coordination system around the vanadium atom is a strongly-distorted square pyramid, and is closer to a trigonal pyramid in shape. The ESR parameters suggest such a structure for the V02'1\" ion containing active sites whose symmetry is close to Cg. The vanadyl complexes formed in the catalysts are more ionic than the usual VO2\"*\" complexes, as shown by an increase in the value of? [27]. This results from a considerable shift of the vanadium atom out of the plane formed by the equatorial ligands. The value estimated for? can be compared with those calculated [28] for various electronic configurations of vanadium. (P is an anisotropic hyperfine parameter which gives direct information about electronic delocalization and covalency.) This indicates that the effective nuclear charge on the vanadium atom in VO2'1\" is nearly +2, owing to charge transfer from the oxygen atom. From studies on the ESR spectra of the vanadium(IV) complexes, Kokoszka et al. [29] obtained the relationship X = 1.45 X 104?, based upon the fact that both the spin-orbit coupling constant and P vary approximately with (r\"3). The value of X estimated from this relationship for catalysts is 133 (\") Cb) 2430 - -4430 Gs 3400- 4400 Gs 509 3713 3357 i A, Fig. 14.

This reduction is attributed to screening effects and to some electron-spin delocalization over the oxygen ligands. The ESR signal measured for the VzOs/MgO catalysts (Fig. 14) with a well-resolved hyperfine structure is overlapped on the strong and distinct spectrum of amorphous vanadium. This fact indicates that two types of 134 TABLE 9 ESR data for 'V^0s free oxide, '^Os/MgO catalysts and some polyvanadates ESR parameters V^Os/MgO catalysts V20s MgiV207 and MgV^O,, A.^ (cm-1) -48X10-4 Ay (cm-1) -48 X10-4 A 2 (cm-1) -161 X10-4 Aiso (cm-1) 86X10-4 fo 1.959 1.88 1.914 ^.v 1.959 gz 1.949 1.99 1.875 8iso 1.956 a2 0 b2 1 P(cm-1) 126 X10-4 k (cm-1) 0.633 TABLE 10 Spin-Hamiltonian constants for VO2\"1' in different lattices Sample 8\\\\ & A n X104 (cm-') A^XIO4 (cm-1) Ref.

The former gives a spectrum with hyperfine structure, whereas the spectrum of amorphous vanadyl has no hyperfine features. The (g) parameter of the amorphous component is equal to 1.96, i.e. close to the mean (g) value of isolated vanadyl: l/3(g\\\\ + 2gi)= 1.9555. Quantitative measurements of the spin concentration for vanadium (IV) in the catalysts under investigation can provide information on the concen- tration of both types of vanadyl ions present in the samples. These studies were performed by the Hyde and Wyard method reported in [31] and 135 employed also by Seshadri and Petrakis [32]. For these calculations a well- known relationship was used: N^/N^^ (M^Ou/M^G^'2 where N=the number of spins per gram, M = integrated area, G = amplifier gain, k and u = 04 + 0,2 4 24 6 6 10 12 14 %V 2 4 6 8 10 13 14 '/,\\1 V S5o- 246S10t214%V 24 Fig. 15. The relation between the vanadium(IV) content and spin concentration of isolated and amorphous vanadyl in fresh (a, c) and reduced (b, d) catalysts. 136 known and unknown samples, respectively. A DPPH standard was used for which N^ = 1.53 X 1021 spins g~1. After double integration of the summary ESR signal and subtraction of the field corresponding to the amorphous component, the spin concentration was divided into two parts, related to isolated and amorphous (unisolated) vanadyl. The results of these evaluations are listed in Table 11 and illustrated graphically in Fig. 15. Quantitative analysis of the ESR signal intensity indicates that the spin concentration on vanadium(IV) in the catalysts under investigation varies from 3.75 to 6.24 X 1019 spins g~' and increases up to 16.7 - 28.00 X 1019 spins g~1 on reducing the samples with gaseous ethylbenzene. Hence, the number of vanadyl ions in the sample increases 4 - 5-fold after reduction. Amorphous vanadyl comprises almost 83 - 90% of the overall vanadyl in the catalyst, while the remaining 10 -17% corresponds to dispersed and isolated V02\"*\" centres. This relation remains unchanged during reduction, i.e. an increase in the V(IV) ions at the expense of vanadium(V) does not change the ratio of amorphous to homogeneously dispersed vanadyl ions. A comparison of the catalyst composition, spin concentration and activity is illustrated in Fig. 15. The highest activity and selectivity is achieved by the samples containing 6 - 8% vanadium. The same trend can be seen from the relation between the sample activity and concentration of vanadium(IV), which indicates that the catalytic activity and concentration of the dispersed vanadyl centres are interrelated. An increase in the vanadium(IV) content to >8% does not result in any increase in activity, since in this case the change in the number of isolated vanadyl centres and their concentration is insignificant. Magnetic susceptibility measurements The gram-magnetic susceptibilities measured by us at room temperature vary over a wide range from 0.05 X 10~6 to 0.27 X 10~6 emu g~' for fresh catalysts and from 1.06 X 10-6 to 10 X 10 ~6 for reduced ones. At 81 K the susceptibility values vary from 0.95 to 1.50 X 10 ~6 for fresh catalysts, and from 4 X 10 ~6 to 32 X 10-6 for reduced ones. The susceptibility of a number of samples exhibited a distinct dependence on the magnetic field intensity applied. The measured gram-magnetic susceptibilities, converted into the respec- tive molar susceptibilities, were introduced into the Wiedemann equation of the following form: XM(catalysts) =MMg2+)Xdla(Mg2+) +MV5+)Xdia(V5+) + +MV4+)[Xdia(V4+) +Xpara(V4+)] + MO^Xdia^2-) for the fresh catalysts, and XM(catalysts) = MMg^XdiaCMg2^ + MV^HXdia^) + Xpara^44)] + +MV3+)[Xdia(V3+) +Xpara(V3+)] + MO^Xdia^2-) for the reduced samples. ,g 0> t- >0 W 0 CM OS ^ T I T f f^ i t t t --< .5 000001000 o ia to >o oo ro ro ro CT 03 ro CM M CM ^ ^^^^^^^ \" 0 i-l CO 10 t 0 00 i-l (3 QOOOOOOOWOOOi 0 Q^ ' '' ^-- --^ ' S.^ ^-/ \"*3 \" c-ooomoo g o m in r~ o oq f- o *i ,~' y ro t- d oo ^ '*' in \"'1 << r-lT-INIMIMINN 5 ac i 3 '-'-5 M mo ooo .S c fi <q o w 10 c~ o CT '5. > \" r4 ^f' (o t-.' ad i~-\" OQ^- 0 i-IIMC'IIMCMiMOl ^^ t ^ ^1 . . iOiOWOiOlOi-1 c8 S OT i-ltOOCOCOOl'* 'S S'- > o o -<' N !' <r' >o' \" s^^ 'a \" ' ' 2 -a u x> e '5 \"S ^ ininr-oiniooi 53 5 c 5 o. ro oq -^ i-i (M ^ rt > S > r-i OT -^ in to (0 i~-' ^0 ___^ OCOOOi-lW^fCO ';' 1-lT-lT-lT-4l-) -^r-l ^ > ' ^^ ^^- s - ^_/ ^ ' ^_^ ^ OOtOCTit-COC't' eo m so to oo oo oo o o d o o o o\" 0 ^ S ^ X g ^^.^^^^^.

Diamagnetic corrections used in these calculations were as follows: X^Mg^) = -3 X 10-6, Xdia(02-) = -12 X 10-6, Xdia^) = -4 X 10-6, Xdia(V4+) = -7 X 10-6, Xdia(V3+) = -10 X 10-6 For instance, a fresh catalyst containing 9.45% vanadium (No. 5, Table 2) has the composition. Mgo.so24V5+o.o833V4+o.oll20o.403l ^d molar mass 23.33. Gram and molar susceptibilities for this sample are 0.22 X 10~6 and 5.12 X 10~6 at room temperature and 1.29 X 10~6 and 30.05 X 10\"6 at 81 K. Molar susceptibilities and magnetic moments calculated from the above data for vanadium(IV), which is the only paramagnetic component of that sample, are 1060 X 10 ~6 and 1.58 BM at 294 K and 3286 X 10~6 and 1.46 BM at 81 K. Table 12 presents a full set of the results obtained in this manner from magnetic measurements. The results indicate that fresh catalysts contain paramagnetic V(IV) ions whose magnetic moments are close to 1.2 - 1.75 BM. The ESR studies discussed above reveal the existence of two types of V02\"1\" ions in the catalysts, those which are isolated and homogeneously dispersed and those which are amorphous with cluster properties. Magnetic exchange between the V(IV) ions belonging to the second type leads to a small decrease of the magnetic moment due to spin-pairing between adjacent metal ions, which is a very well known phenomenon 133]. The presence of the oxygen bond facilitates exchange interactions between the V(IV) ions in the catalysts. Such interactions result not only in partial spin-pairing for catalysts rich in vanadium, but also in a dependence of the magnetic suscep- tibility on the magnetic field and in a dependence of magnetic moments on the temperature. Figure 16 illustrates some of these relations. Reduction of the catalysts with ethylbenzene leads to a decrease of the mean oxidation degree of vanadium. The ESR studies described above indicated that the intensity of the signal attributed to the V4\"1\" ions increases initially with increasing vanadium content, passes through a maximum and finally becomes nearly constant. The spin concentration of vanadium(IV) is 4 - 5 times higher for reduced samples than for fresh catalysts. However, magnetic susceptibilities of the reduced catalysts are nearly 10 times higher, and magnetic moments exceed considerably the values characteristic of d1 vanadium(IV). Magnetic moments and susceptibilities of the reduced samples were evaluated, including the values of molar susceptibilities calculated for vanadium(IV) in fresh catalysts. Magnetic moments increase during reduction and are higher than those corresponding to the 'spin only' formula of the d1 ion. It is clear that the presence of the V3\"1\" ions in addition to the V4\"*\" ions contributes to an increase in the calculated magnetic moments. Values of ^(V34\") in reduced samples are close to 2.66 - 2.80 BM at room temperature and somewhat lower (2.62 - 2.75) at 81 K.

The relationship of magnetic susceptibilities and magnetic moments with respect to vanadium content and temperature. Reaction mechanism The physicochemical studies discussed above provide various informa- tion on the structure of the surface layer and on the mechanism of the reaction under investigation. The catalyst surface layer, formed mainly by 141 the tetrahedral V04 framework, contains a certain number of embedded octahedral V(V) sites which contain an oxo-type terminal oxygen and are connected to other layer components by means of oxygen bridges. This type of structure resembles the spinel-type lattice in which octahedral poly- hedra are linked via their edges with the tetrahedral base. Oxygen vacancies of the polymeric vanadate layer form another system of active sites consisting of five-coordinated vanadyl ions with a square pyramid structure. The V^Og/MgO catalysts belong to a group of mixed valence systems, and their catalytic properties in the oxidative dehydrogenation are related to the structure of their active sites consisting of V(V) and V(IV) ions. The oxygen bridge linking these ions allows electron exchange between them and acts as an electron transmitter. Both V(V) and V(IV) cooperate closely in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The V(III) ions are most probably the final stage of the catalytic process, and result from the deficit in the reoxidative atmosphere, The mechanism of the reaction under investigation may be explained on the basis of a highly dynamic model of the working catalyst. This reaction may proceed according to either of two mechanisms suggested. ri H -C-H H-c H, 0 ^ '0 O^fods) . 0^ ^(v)-O-VOv) ^^ > ^jj ^M-O-VClY) - formation ^>/' ' H \"-9-\" H-C-K H-C-H, H-C balance of i 0 O2 ^< 0'\" Os etes+ron -/'-S 1; howolytc /^ I [ ;j vv)-o-^(v 7 - f!-)J '/Civ)-o-v(v cter^ of<N) Ss^ flsslon L'- \" H-C<-ti\\ H-C^ \\^ , \"\" OH OB 1. ^^0.:\") 9z elecAoo /-'S 'i 1 , , cicriion transfer /' 'i 1 , . ! , - f-1- : ^ v - o- v(iv - f(+ !1 vQv -o-vQv +rt3nsf<=f \\./ ~^ ' l ; fion bctiacne nrg 1^^ \\ ' l ' H -H H-C-fti\\ -^'H>C-ti i ^ '- , 10 < i ti-c-ti 4-? \\^ -0 ^Htc-H ^-H hcfctolytic fiaejot) .^'Ss T' Fig. 17.

Mechanism of the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene (via the o-complex) on the V^Os/MgO catalyst. The first mechanism consists of the formation of an ethylbenzene complex with the active catalyst site, as occurs with Mo03/MgO catalysts [I], and is illustrated in Fig. 17. On the other hand, the second mechanism proceeds through the formation of the o-complex; the diagram of that reaction is presented in Fig. 18. In both mechanisms the oxygen bonds serve as a carrier for delocalized electrons between the donor and acceptor catalyst sites. References 1 W. Oganowski and J.

The nature and structure of the VVVIV active centres is discussed on the basis of the physicochemical (radiographic, thermogravimetric, electron microscopic, IR, RS, UV, VIS, ESR, luminescence and magnetic) properties. The VVVIV/VIII redox system linked by oxygen bridges was shown to play an important role in the catalytic process.",
