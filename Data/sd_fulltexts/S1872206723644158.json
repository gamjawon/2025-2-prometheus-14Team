The selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO is a promising solution for the design of carbon-neutral, sustainable processes. Achieving a highly selective single reduction product is still challenging because of the energetically favorable competing hydrogen evolution reaction. We report the fabrication of N-doped sponge-like porous graphitic carbon structures embedded with Fe nanoparticles (Fe@NPC) via the pre-modification of a metal-organic framework (IRMOF-3(Zn)) with carboxyferrocene, followed by pyrolysis. The as-prepared Fe@NPC exhibited a 96.4% CO Faradaic efficiency at –0.5 VRHE and good stability. The exceptional CO2 reduction performance is attributed to the unique structure of the composite catalyst, which provides abundant hierarchical pores that increase CO2 adsorption and mass transfer, and active Fe sites that synergistically accelerate the kinetics of CO generation. The in situ attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared analysis provided proof of the improved ability of Fe@NPC to accumulate the crucial intermediate *COOH compared with other pyrolyzed porous carbons. Fe@NPC was used in a Zn-CO2 battery that delivered a maximum power density of 3.0 mW cm–2, evidencing its potential for application in energy-converting devices. Graphical Abstract Fe nanoparticles were embedded in N-doped porous carbons derived from a pre-modified metal-organic framework, resulting in an Fe@NPC composite with an excellent FECO of 96.4% at –0.5 VRHE. This catalyst can be employed in a Zn-CO2 battery, providing a peak power density of 3 mW cm–2 with good durability. Keywords Fe nanoparticles Metal organic frameworks N-doped porous carbon CO2 electroreduction Zn-CO2 battery 1 Introduction Excessive emissions of CO2, one of the main greenhouse gases, have drawn global attention owing to the severe energy crisis and effects of global warming [1–3]. Continuous efforts have been made to reduce CO2 accumulation and develop sustainable processes to achieve carbon neutrality [4–6]. The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) has emerged as an attractive strategy for re-utilizing CO2, converting renewable electric energy into value-added products under mild conditions, and ultimately implementing an anthropogenic carbon cycle [7–12]. CO2-to-CO conversion is considered the most promising ECO2RR route because CO can be easily recovered from aqueous solutions and used as a reagent in chemical reactions such as methanol production and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [13–16]. Furthermore, CO2-to-CO conversion can be utilized as the cathodic reaction of a Zn-CO2 battery (ZCB), combining CO2 electroreduction with energy storage [17–19]. Nevertheless, satisfactory CO selectivity and productivity are significantly restricted by the high C=O bond energy in CO2 and the actively competing hydrogen evolution reaction under aqueous conditions [20,21]. Noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) are attractive electrocatalysts with high CO selectivity but are still underdeveloped and costly [22–27]. Iron is an attractive alternative metal for electrocatalysis owing to its sufficient reserves, low cost, and potential applications [28,29]. For example, single-atom Fe–N–C catalysts exhibit good performances for CO2-to-CO electroreduction [30–32]. However, their selectivity for CO decreases significantly with increasing nanoparticle concentration, due to aggregation, poor stability, and a comparatively low CO2 adsorption capacity [33,34]. Thus, the development of novel Fe NP catalysts with favorable activities and stabilities is challenging. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), composed of metal nodes coordinated to organic linkers, are considered excellent precursors for the synthesis of porous carbon matrices. They possess high intrinsic porosity and electronic conductivity, which promote mass transfer, and provide diverse interfaces containing heteroatoms that anchor to and activate metal NPs [35–55]. Thus, encapsulating Fe NPs within MOFs may provide an opportunity to develop stable and highly active catalysts. In this study, we embedded Fe NPs in a sponge-like N-doped porous carbon (NPC) matrix via one-step pyrolysis of pre-modified IRMOF-3(Zn) with ligand displacement of carboxyferrocene (Fc-COOH), affording the composite catalyst Fe@NPC. Fe@NPC showed a maximum CO faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 92.1% at –0.6 VRHE in an H-cell, which was significantly higher than that of the control samples of MOF-5-D and NPC IRMOF-3-D. This catalyst exhibited an even higher FECO of 96.4% in the flow cell with excellent stability. The in situ attenuated total re?ectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) analysis and experimental results revealed the crucial role of synergistic interactions between Fe sites and NPC CO2 adsorption and the accelerated kinetics of the *COOH intermediate. Interestingly, a ZCB using Fe@NPC as the cathode delivered a peak power density of 3.0 mW cm–2, achieving efficient energy conversion. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, carboxyferrocene (Fc-COOH), triethylamine (TEA), potassium hydroxide, potassium bicarbonate, and zinc(II) acetate were purchased from Aladdin. 2-amino-terephthalic acid (NH2-BDC), terephthalic acid (H2BDC), and iron powder were purchased from Macklin. Nafion solution (5 wt%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar. All chemicals were used without further purification. Carbon dioxide (99.999%) and argon (99.999%) were purchased from Guangqi. Deionized water was used. 2.2 Preparation of IRMOF-3-Fc-COOH, IRMOF-3, and MOF-5 The preparation of IRMOF-3-Fc-COOH followed a previous report with some modifications [56]. Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (4 mmol), NH2-BDC (2 mmol), and Fc-COOH (0.06 mmol) were dissolved in 30 mL of DMF. TEA (6 mmol) was quickly added under continuous stirring, followed by stirring for 2 h at room temperature. The product was separated using filtration, washed with DMF and dichloromethane, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. IRMOF-3 and MOF-5 were prepared using a similar procedure but without adding Fc-COOH. In MOF-5, NH2-BDC was replaced with H2BDC. 2.3 Preparation of Fe@NPC, IRMOF-3-D and MOF-5-D Dried IRMOF-3-Fc-COOH powder (150 mg) was placed in a corundum boat and heated in a tube furnace at 900 °C under Ar flow for 2 h (heating rate of 5 °C min–1). After cooling to room temperature, the sample was washed with 3 mol L–1 HCl for 30 min to remove unstable compounds and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h to yield Fe@NPC. IRMOF-3-D and MOF-5-D were prepared from their corresponding precursors using a similar method. 2.4 Characterization The crystalline structures of all catalysts were determined using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD, Rigaku SmartLab, 30 kV, 40 mA, Cu Kα radiation). The morphologies and microstructures of as-prepared samples were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM; EM-1400 Plus, JEOL, 120 kV). HAADF-STEM images were obtained using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, ARM200P, JEOL, 300 kV). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained using a VG ESCALABMKII instrument. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained using a Bruker Alpha spectrometer. The elemental metal content was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, American TJA IRIS(HR)). Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were obtained from N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms using a Quantachrome instrument (Autosorb-iQ2-MP, 0 °C). X-ray absorption spectra were collected at beamline BL11B at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The data were processed using IFEFFIT software. 2.5 Electrochemical measurements 2.5.1 Preparation of the working electrode To prepare the working electrode, 10 mg of the catalyst was suspended in 900 μL ethanol and 100 μL Nafion dispersion (5 wt%). The mixture formed a homogeneous ink after 30 min of sonication. The coating areas of the carbon paper used in the H-cell and gas diffusion electrode (GDE) devices were 1 cm–2. Catalyst loading was 1 mg cm–2. 2.5.2 Electrochemical performance evaluation The electrochemical performances of the catalysts were evaluated at room temperature using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E). To determine the electrochemical performances of the H-cell, the two chambers were separated by an anion-exchange membrane (Nafion 117). Pt foil and Ag/AgCl were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A 0.5 mol L–1 KHCO3 solution was bubbled with CO2 or Ar for at least 30 min to saturate the electrolyte. Twenty CV sweep cycles were conducted before the linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) curve test. The LSV curves were collected at a scanning rate of 5 mV s –1. To evaluate the electrochemical performance of GDE, an anion membrane (Sustainion X37-50 grade T) was used to separate the catholyte and anolyte chambers. 1 M KOH was used as the electrolyte, and the CO2 (99.999%) flow rate in the cathode GDE was kept at 25 mL min−1. The electrolyte flow rate in the cathode and anode was maintained at 75 rpm using a peristaltic pump (Cole-Parmer). All potentials were measured against a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and converted to the RHE reference scale using E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.21V + 0.0591pH. 2.5.3 Product analysis The gas-phase products of CO2 reduction were quantified using a gas chromatograph (GC Shimadzu 2014) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas. The liquid products were dissolved in DMSO and D2O and analyzed by 1H-NMR (Bruker, 400 MHz). The Faradaic efficiency was calculated using the following equation: FE% = I/I total = nxVF/I total × 100% where I is the partial current density (A), I total is the total current used (A), n is the electron transfer number of reduction products, (2 for both CO and H2), x is the mole fraction of product, V is the gas flow rate (mL min−1), and F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1). 2.5.4 Fabrication of ZCB An Fe@NPC catalyst supported on carbon paper (1 cm × 1 cm) (1 mg cm–2) and zinc foil were used as the cathode and anode, respectively. A 0.8 mol L–1 CO2-saturated KHCO3 solution and a 0.8 mol L–1 KOH solution containing 0.02 mol L–1 Zn(OAc)2 were used as the cathodic and anodic electrolytes, respectively. The open-circuit voltage, polarization curve test, and galvanostatic discharge curves of the ZCB were obtained at room temperature. The charge-discharge cycle stability of liquid ZCB was tested at a cycling interval of 20 min (10 min for charging and 10 min for discharging) using the LAND-CT2001A testing system. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterizations of catalysts Fig. 1(a) illustrates the synthesis of Fe@NPC via coordination of Fc-COOH, followed by thermal carbonization. IRMOF-3-Fc-COOH was synthesized from Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, NH2-BDC, and Fc-COOH using the solvothermal method in DMF at room temperature. A small fraction of the NH2-BDC linkers in IRMOF-3(Zn) were replaced by Fc-COOH ligands, introducing ferrocene groups while maintaining the overall framework. The PXRD pattern of IRMOF-3-Fc-COOH was similar to that of IRMOF-3, indicating the invariability of the MOF precursor after the reaction (Fig. S1). IRMOF-3-Fc-COOH was subjected to thermal treatment at 900 °C and washed with HCl to remove unstable components, affording Fe NPs deposited on MOF-derived N-doped porous carbon (Fe@NPC). After pyrolysis, only two broad peaks located at 26° and 44° were observed in the PXRD patterns, which corresponded to the (002) and (101) planes of graphitic carbon, respectively. No Fe diffraction peaks were discernible, probably because of the low Fe NP loading that was evenly distributed (Fig. S2). MOF-5-D and IRMOF-3-D were fabricated similarly from the corresponding precursors to form porous carbon and NPC control samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed that Fe@NPC, MOF-5-D, and IRMOF-3-D had similar sponge-like structures with highly porous features (Figs. 1(b), S3, and S4). TEM and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images of Fe@NPC (Figs. 1(c), S5, and S6) revealed that the Fe NPs were homogeneously deposited on MOF-derived carbon with a mean diameter of ~7.06 nm (Fig. S7). The HRTEM image of Fe@NPC (Fig. 1(d)) showed a 0.204 nm spacing between lattice fringes, which corresponds to the (110) plane of Fe. The Raman spectra revealed similar I D/I G ratios for these catalysts, demonstrating a similar degree of graphitization of nanocarbon (Fig. S8) [57,58]. XPS was performed to understand the electronic state of key elements in these materials. The N 1s spectra of both Fe@NPC and IRMOF-3-D (Figs. 2(a) and S9) show peaks corresponding to graphitic N (401.3 eV), pyrrolic N (400.5 eV), Fe–N (399.5 eV), and pyridinic N (398.4 eV), thus proving the successful doping of N into porous carbon. In addition, XPS analysis revealed a low Fe loading in Fe@NPC (0.22 wt%), matching the results of ICP-AES (0.22 wt%). Neither technique detected Zn in IRMOF-3-Fc-COOH-D, IRMOF-3-D, or MOF-5-D samples (Fig. S10 and Tables S1 and S2), indicating its negligible concentration. Fig. S11 showed a main peak around 708.0 eV, corresponding to the 2p 3/2 of Fe0 [59,60]. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of Fe@NPC showed a strong signal at g = 2.100, corresponding to the characteristics of Fe (Fig. 2(b)) [61]. In the Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum (Fig. 2(c)), the absorption edge of Fe@NPC was closer to that of the Fe foil, indicating that the chemical valence of Fe was approximately 0. However, its photoenergy increased, indicating the presence of electron interactions between Fe and the NPC. From the Fourier-transformed k3-weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum (Fig. 2(d)), we observed dominant peaks at ~2.2 Å and a very small peak at ~1.50 Å corresponding to Fe–Fe and Fe–N/C bonds, respectively. Thus, Fe exists mainly in the form of Fe NPs, with very few Fe–N/C bonds distributed on the surface of Fe NPs that connect Fe NPs with the NPC [17]. Furthermore, Fe@NPC showed a large BET surface area (1264 m2 g) with hierarchical micropores and mesopores (Figs. S12–S15) and presented a CO2 adsorption capacity higher than that of IRMOF-3-D and MOF-5-D (93.5 cm3 g–1) (Fig. S16). The high CO2 adsorption ability of this hierarchical porous structure, along with its abundant active sites, can provide faster mass transfer and improved CO2 conversion [62]. 3.2 Electrocatalytic performance for CO2 reduction ECO2RR activities were first studied in an H-cell using 0.5M KHCO3 as the electrolyte. LSV revealed that the current responses of all samples were higher under a CO2-saturated atmosphere than under an Ar-saturated atmosphere, possibly because of their catalytic CO2 reduction activities (Figs. 3(a) and S17–S19). Gas products were detected by gas chromatography; H2 and CO were the primary products of this reaction, with a total Faradaic efficiency approaching 100%. No liquid products were observed in the 1H NMR spectra (Fig. S20). All FE values were calculated as the average of three experiments. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the maximum FECO of IRMOF-3-D (65.3% at –0.6 VRHE) was 1.3 times higher than that of MOF-5-D (49.9%), indicating that N-doping can facilitate CO2 electroreduction. Notably, Fe@NPC exhibited a higher current density and lower onset potential (–0.3 VRHE) than IRMOF-3-D and MOF-5-D. Furthermore, it showed higher CO selectivity in all potential ranges (from –0.3 to –1.0 VRHE) and obtained a higher FECO with 92.1% at –0.6 VRHE (Figs. S21–S23). Improved ECO2RR using Fe@NPC was further confirmed by its closeness to 100% Faradaic efficiency of H2 under Ar (Fig. S24). We have also evaluated the stability of Fe@NPC H-cells. Fig. S25 shows that Fe@NPC can tolerate 50 h in a H-cell with no obvious decay in FEco (>90.0%). PXRD, TEM, and XPS results (Figs. S26–S28) of Fe@NPC after the durability test revealed that the structure was maintained, with no distinct aggregation of Fe NPs, significant change in morphology, or variation in Fe valence. The CO partial current density (JCO) of Fe@NPC was also significantly higher than that of control samples (Fig. 3(c)).Fe@NPC achieved the lowest Tafel slope (121 mV dec–1) and electric resistance (Figs. S29 and S30), demonstrating favorable charge transfer and better electrical conductivity that benefit faster kinetics in CO formation. Because of the limited solubility of CO2 in an aqueous solution in the H-cell, the FEco and stability of Fe@NPC were further evaluated in a flow cell. As shown in Figs. 3(d) and 3(e), a higher FECO of 96.4% at a lower potential (–0.5 VRHE) and an increased JCO were obtained. Moreover, a favorable FECO (>90%) was achieved at a potential range (–0.3 VRHE to –1.1 VRHE) comparable to state-of-the-art catalysts (Table S3). A long-term stability test of Fe@NPC was conducted at –0.5 VRHE, where the best FECO was acquired. The partial current density and FECO remained nearly unchanged during continuous electrolysis for 16 h, indicating that the N-doped carbon matrix effectively prevented Fe NPs from aggregating or otherwise decomposing (Fig. 3(f)). A poisoning experiment of Fe@NPC conducted using an electrolyte containing NaSCN revealed a slight degradation of FEco, proving that Fe–N/C was essential for the catalytic process, even in small amounts (Fig. S31) [31]. For comparison, Fe NP catalysts dominated by (110) facets used Fe powder and exhibited inert CO production (Figs. S32 and S33). XPS analysis of Fe (110) was conducted to further explore the role of the catalyst microenvironment. Fe 2P 3/2 had a higher binding energy in Fe powder than in Fe@NPC because of the partial surface oxidation after prolonged air exposure (Fig. S34), indicating that when Fe NPs are encapsulated in N-doped porous carbon of Fe@NPC, the carbon matrix connected with the Fe–N/C bond may prevent Fe NPs from being oxidized and thus exert the activity of Fe NPs [63–65]. Therefore, the composite structure of Fe@NPC created a unique catalytic environment, with an abundant hierarchical pore structure that promoted CO2 adsorption and mass transfer and special Fe–N/C interface interactions between Fe NP sites and N-doped carbon that activated and stabilized Fe NPs. These characteristics synergistically contributed to an excellent ECO2RR performance. 3.3 The catalytic mechanism study using in situ ATR-FTIR *COOH is considered a major obstacle for efficient electrochemical CO2-to-CO conversion owing to its high energy barrier [16,21]. In situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was performed to monitor reaction intermediates and explore the mechanism of CO2 reduction. As shown in Figs. 4(a), 4(b) , S35, and S36, the *COOH (“*” refers to the adsorption sites on the catalyst surface) peaks in the 1260–1560 cm–1 range gradually increase with electrolysis time. The peaks at 1560, 1400, 1331, and 1260 cm–1 were attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of *COOH, C–O stretching vibration, and the vibration of an OH deformation intermediate, respectively [66–68]. With the gradual formation and accumulation of intermediates, Fe@NPC had a higher *COOH peak intensity than IRMOF-3-D and MOF-5-D (Fig. S37), indicating its accelerated kinetics. Still, the *CO peak was difficult to observe because of its easy desorption [69]. Therefore, a mechanism for the ECO2RR using Fe@NPC is tentatively proposed based on ATR-FTIR data (Fig. 4(c)): (1) CO2 conversion to *COOH, initiated by CO2 adsorption and activation to generate *CO2 and subsequent protonation to form *COOH; (2) *CO formation via proton-coupled electron transfer; and (3) *CO desorption. 3.4 ZCB assembly and performance tests Given its excellent ECO2RR performance, Fe@NPC was directly used as a cathode in a rechargeable ZCB to demonstrate its potential applications (Fig. 5(a) ). During the discharging process, CO2 is reduced at the cathode, and the Zn plate is dissolved at the anode. During the charging process, oxygen evolution reactions and Zn precipitation occurred in the cathode and anode, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5(b), two ZCBs in series could power a light-emitting diode, demonstrating their potential use in other energy conversion devices. The narrower gap of the discharge-charge polarization curves using the Fe@NPC cathode clearly confirmed its improved profile for rechargeable batteries. A peak power density of 3.0 mW cm–2 was achieved during the discharge process, significantly higher than that of MOF-5-D, IRMOF-3-D, and most reported devices (Figs. 5(c), S38, and S39, and Table S4). Over 65.0% FECO was maintained at a discharge density of 3 mA (Fig. 5(d)). The maximum FECO was achieved at 1 mA (70.1%), demonstrating the excellent properties of these rechargeable ZCBs over a wide range of discharge currents. Fe@NPC was also stable for over 40 h (120 cycles) at 0.5 mA cm–2 (Fig. 5(e)), evidencing the activation and stabilization effects of the N-doped carbon matrix on the Fe NPs. 4 Conclusions We introduced well-dispersed Fe NPs into a sponge-like porous N-doped carbon matrix. The obtained Fe@NPC electrocatalyst features a maximum FECO of 96.4% at a potential of –0.5 VRHE in the flow cell, along with excellent FECO > 90.0% in the –0.3 to –1.1 VRHE potential range. This exceptional catalytic performance is attributed to synergistic interactions between the Fe sites and NPC, which improved CO2 adsorption and accelerated the accumulation of the *COOH intermediate. The assembled ZCB exhibited an excellent peak power density of 3 mW cm–2 and good durability. This study provides a novel and facile method for the design of high-performance Fe-based catalysts for selective CO2 reduction and switchable energy conversion.

        "dc:description": "The selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO is a promising solution for the design of carbon-neutral, sustainable processes. Achieving a highly selective single reduction product is still challenging because of the energetically favorable competing hydrogen evolution reaction. We report the fabrication of N-doped sponge-like porous graphitic carbon structures embedded with Fe nanoparticles (Fe@NPC) via the pre-modification of a metal-organic framework (IRMOF-3(Zn)) with carboxyferrocene, followed by pyrolysis. The as-prepared Fe@NPC exhibited a 96.4% CO Faradaic efficiency at –0.5 VRHE and good stability. The exceptional CO2 reduction performance is attributed to the unique structure of the composite catalyst, which provides abundant hierarchical pores that increase CO2 adsorption and mass transfer, and active Fe sites that synergistically accelerate the kinetics of CO generation. The in situ attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared analysis provided proof of the improved ability of Fe@NPC to accumulate the crucial intermediate *COOH compared with other pyrolyzed porous carbons. Fe@NPC was used in a Zn-CO2 battery that delivered a maximum power density of 3.0 mW cm–2, evidencing its potential for application in energy-converting devices.",
