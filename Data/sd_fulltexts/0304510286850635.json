Among reactions studied were the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene, p.K 36, and cyclohexane, pK^ 45, to benzene, and ethylbenzene to styrene. The reactions proceeded with high conversions and selectivity at temperatures above 500 C. Cracking reactions were suppressed and the catalyst was stable to deactivation over long time periods. Comparison of ^-A^Oa with other common supports showed it was the most effective and selective. Introduction Dehydrogenation of cycloparaffins, cycloolefins and alkyi aromatics is a commonly performed gas phase catalytic reaction. Generally, supported metal catalysts such as Pt/Al^Oa, Pd/C, Ni/A^Oa or Cr 203^203 among others are used to carry out the reactions [1]. These catalysts are often sensitive to sulfur poisoning and therefore use of catalysts not requiring preliminary desulfurization may be of importance. We have found that the above dehydrogenations may be performed using potassium hydroxide on alumina as catalyst. Base-catalyzed dehydrogenations have not been exten- sively investigated, although some work has been done and reviewed [2]. Most research in this area deals with dehydrogenation of cyclic hexadienes and began with the isomerization and dehydrogenation of d-limonene to p-cymene by use of a sodium-benzylsodium catalyst [3]. Later, cyclic dienes were also dehydrogenated with other catalysts such as lithium or potassium ethylenediamine [4, 5], potassium t-butoxide in DMSO [6], and disproportionation was found using alkali metal-naphthalene (M'^N\") [7] and potassium t-butoxide in DMSO [8]. More recently, potassium metal * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/86/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 132 dispersed on alumina has been used to isomerize and dehydrogenate 1-vinyl- 4-cyclohexene to ethylbenzene [9]. The use of supported alkali hydroxides in gas phase dehydrogenations of cycloparaffins and cycloolefins is un- known, whereas only one instance of dehydrogenation of alkyi aromatics is known in the patent literature [10]. In this article we present our preliminary results on the use of potas- sium hydroxide supported on alumina, KOH/A^Oa, as a dehydrogenation catalyst. Reactions investigated include dehydrogenation of a cycloolefin, cyclohexane, to benzene; dehydrogenation of a cycloparaffin, cyclohexane, to benzene; dehydrogenation of an alkyi aromatic, ethylbenzene, to styrene; and finally isomerization and dehydrogenation of a nonconjugated cyclic diene, vinylcyclohexene, to ethylbenzene. Experimental Catalyst preparation 10% Potassium hydroxide on 7-alumina, 10% KOH^-Al^Oa, was pre- pared by dissolving 11.76 g potassium hydroxide (Merck, analytical grade, 85% assay) in 100 ml of absolute methanol. 90 g of the 7-alumina support (Strem Chemicals, high surface area 200 - 220 m2 g~1, catalytic grade) were added and the methanol was slowly evaporated in a flash evaporator at 20 mmHg at 30 C for 2 h, giving the impregnated catalyst. The catalyst was then dried under a stream of argon for 3 h at 250 C and used as such. Simi- larly prepared were 10% KOH/SiO;, 10% KOH/C and 10% KOH/SiOz-Alps using as supports coarse silica gel (BDH, surface area 400 m2 g~1), granulated charcoal (Merck, surface area 1000 m2 g~1), and silica-alumina (Strem Chem- icals, surface area 200 m2 g~1) respectively. Reaction system Dehydrogenations were performed in an isothermal Pyrex tubular reactor (15 mm i.d.) filled with 4 g. catalyst as the catalytic bed and 10 g glass beads as the preheater. The substrates were fed into the reactor by a peristaltic pump (Ismatec IP4). At the exit the product stream was trapped at 78 C and analyzed. Temperature was measured on the catalytic bed by a Fe/K thermocouple and controlled to 5 C. Ana/ysis After the exit stream was cooled, samples were taken and analyzed by gas chromatography. The gas chromatograph used was Hewlett Packard Model 5790A equipped with a 25 m Carbowax 20 M Silica capillary column, i.d. 0.15 mm, and a FID detector. Areas were computed by use of a Hewlett Packard Model 3390A integrator. The non-condensed gases, including hydrogen and in some cases Ci and hydrocarbons, were not quantitatively analyzed. 133 Results and discussion The mechanism of base-catalyzed dehydrogenation of cyclohexadienes has been proposed to proceed by a series of reactions as presented in Scheme 1 [2]. + B- ^-> ^1 + BH + H' + H- -, :-:1 + H, Scheme 1. The dehydrogenation was explained by reversible deprotonation of the ally lie carbon of the cyclohexadiene, forming a planar cyclohexadiene anion. The latter then eliminates a hydride anion, forming the aromatic ring. The hydride then reacts with another cyclohexadiene, forming a new carbanion and molecular hydrogen. It is obvious from such a mechanism that the activation takes place by deprotonation at an ally lie carbon. Assuming a similar mechanism for cycloolefins, cycloparaffins and alkyi aromatics, a prerequisite for dehydrogenation of the above is sufficient basicity of 10% KOH/A1203 to give the corresponding carbanion. It has been found in the past that potassium hydroxide can activate substrates with a pK^ < 35* in liquid phase reactions; however, substrates with pXa> 35 failed to react [11, 12]. By performing reactions in the gas phase and thereby eliminating water solvation of the hydroxide anion, base-catalyzed activation and dehydro- genation are possible. The first reaction performed was the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene, p^a 35-36, to benzene, eqn. (1). Oslow ^ f^l fast ^ f^l (1) \"\"^U^^ The results, summarized in Table 1, show that the dehydrogenation reaction takes place at a temperature as low as 450 C and very effectively at 550 - 600 C. The selectivity of the reaction is very high, with only very small amounts of cyclohexane formed through a disproportionation reaction, whereas the intermediate product, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, disappears as quickly *pK^ in this paper refer to pK^ by the MSAD scale. 134 TABLE 1 Dehydrogenation of cyclohexene over 10% KOH on y-AlzOs'1 Temperature Analysis of product stream (%) ( C) cyclohexane cyclohexene benzene cyclohexadiene other 450 trace 98.84 1.16 500 trace 95.71 4.26 - 550 0.45 71.58 27-38 0.24 0.25 600 0.47 6.96 92.14 0.27 0.26 reaction conditions as described in the experimental section at a LHSV of 1 h as it is formed. It is important to point out that the catalyst was found to be extremely stable under the above reaction conditions. Continuous feed of cyclohexene over 10% KOH^-A^Os at 600 C at a LHSV of 1 h-1 for a period of 24 h showed that the total conversion decreased by only 1.8%, whereas the selectivity of the reaction remained unaffected. Therefore, it was shown that KOH/AlaO^ is able to activate and dehy- drogenate carbon acids with a p-Ka > 35 in a gas phase reaction. In order to further characterize the catalytic activity of KOH/A^Oa, the dehydrogena- tion of cyclohexane to benzene, eqn. (2), was performed. Cyclohexane, p-Ka = 45, is the weakest hydrocarbon acid known, and its activation and dehydrogenation show that KOH/AlaO^ at least theoretically, may be active in dehydrogenation of all hydrocarbons. The results of cyclo- hexane dehydrogenation are tabulated in Table 2, and indicate that although only very slight activity is found at temperatures up to 550 C, at 600 C the KOH/AlzOa catalyst is active for dehydrogenation with very high selec- tivity. The reaction is indeed apparently base-catalyzed, for the attempted dehydrogenation of cyclohexane over J-Al^Oy alone gave no reaction under the same conditions. Since 7-A1203 is a known cracking catalyst due to its acidic sites, it was important to examine the activity of the KOH/A^Oa catalyst where cracking TABLE 2 Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane over 10% KOH on -y-Al^Oa Temperature Analysis of product stream (%) /0/~1\\ cyclohexene benzene other 500 99.95 0.05 550 99.50 0.5 600 88.98 11.02 trace reaction conditions as described in the experimental section at a LHSV of 1 h~ 135 could be a significant side reaction. To this end, the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, eqn. (3), was performed. (3) In this case, cracking products formed in possible side reactions include benzene, toluene and lower C; and C; hydrocarbons. The results given in Table 3 show that impregnation of KOH onto A^Oa significantly inhibits cracking, and the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene is the major reaction pathway. Surprisingly, more toluene was found than benzene (lower hydrocarbons were not analyzed) at 550 - 600 C. The conversion at 600 C is high, considering that at this temperature the thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation reaction are unfavorable, AG ~ 2 kcal mol~1 at atmospher- ic pressure. The results indicate that the majority, but not all, of the acidic sites on -y-AlzOa are blocked or have been made basic, since cracking is acid- catalyzed.

For example, a combination of isomerization and dehydrogena- tion of l-vinyl-4-cyclohexene to ethylbenzene, eqn. (4), at temperatures up to 450 C was performed. -\"2 (4) Analysis of the product stream of a reaction performed at 450 C and LHSV of 1 h~1 showed 73.70% ethylbenzene, 23.11% vinylcyclohexene, 3.20% dienes, 0.45% styrene and 0.54% unidentified products. When per- forming the above reaction with 10% KaCOa/AlaOa, only isomerization products were found, indicating that potassium carbonate is not sufficiently basic to catalyze dehydrogenation, although it is sufficient for isomerization. The nature of the KOH/AlzOa catalyst is unknown and has yet to be studied. On the one hand, it may be argued that the -y-AlzOa support serves to disperse the potassium hydroxide base over a large surface area. Increasing 136 the surface area increases the absorption and thereby the reaction rate. In addition, separation of the KOH molecules may increase their basicity by reducing self-solvation caused by strong hydrogen bonding. On the other hand, it is possible that in addition to supplying increased surface area, there may be certain interactions between KOH and A^Oa which would be bene- ficial to the catalytic activity. To gain some preliminary insight into this question, we compared the use of J-Ai^Os as a support for dehydrogenation reactions to that of other common supports such as charcoal silica or silica- alumina. From the results summarized in Table 4 for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene on various supports, it is obvious that the support plays an important role in the dehydrogenation reaction. 7^203 was the most effective and selective support. Charcoal was also selective, although less effective, and continuing the reaction over longer time periods showed that it was also easily deactivated. SiO; and SiOz/AlaOa were ineffective, supports for the dehydrogenation reaction, other pathways, especially cracking, being the predominant reactions. From these results one may tentatively state that, in addition to the importance of a large surface area, interactions between 7-A1203 and KOH are important for effective dehy- drogenations.
