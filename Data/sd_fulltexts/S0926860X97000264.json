The potential of vanadia-titania catalysts for the production of methyl formate through methanol oxidation is outlined, and mechanistic and technical features of this process are discussed. Keywords: Methanol oxidation; Vanadia catalysts; Formaldehyde; Methyl formate I. Introduction. Vanadia-based systems are widely applied in oxidative catalysis [1]. Several industrial applications are outlined in other contributions of the present issue. Selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde represents an important industrial process [2,3]. On the other hand, a wide range of other products (e.g. dimethyl ether, dimethoxymethane, methyl formate, carbon oxides, hydrocarbons) can be obtained depending on both the redox properties and the acidity of the catalyst. Consequently, the catalytic evolution of methanol, either in the presence or in the absence of oxygen, is informative of the surface structure and behavior of the catalyst, and in fact it has been widely used as a test reaction [4-6]. In this work we first discuss the data reported in the literature concerning the oxidation of methanol over vanadia-based catalysts. Then, we review our own results on the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and methyl formate over V2Os-TiO2 systems with regard to the influence of the operating variables, the investigation of the reaction mechanism and the aspects related to the implementa- tion of an industrial process. Notably, the synthesis of methyl formate is of peculiar * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Unsupported vanadia catalysts 2.1. Methanol oxidation on pure vanadia Among binary transition metal oxides, vanadium pentoxide, V205, is one of the few which allow significant selectivities in formaldehyde synthesis from methanol oxidative dehydrogenation. The others are MOO3, WO3 and U308 [7,8]. In appropriate conditions (e.g. 310, in CH3OH : O2 : He 4.5 : 15 : 80.5) yields of the order of 90% in formaldehyde production can be obtained over this catalyst [9]. Accordingly, the use of V205 as the catalyst for an industrial process for formaldehyde synthesis has been proposed many years ago [10]. This reaction has been investigated over pure V205 from several points of view. Bhatthacharyya et al. [11] investigated the reaction kinetics of formaldehyde synthesis on bulk vanadia in the temperature range 245-280, and proposed the following kinetic law: r = 2klk2PMPo/(klPM + 2k2Po), where PM and Po are the methanol and oxygen partial pressures, respectively, and kl and k2 are the kinetic constants for methanol oxidation and catalyst reoxidation, respectively. This kinetic law is consistent with a Mars-van Krevelen-type redox mechanism where the rates of both steps are first order with respect to the reactants, methanol and oxygen [11]. In the conditions of the experiments reported by Roozenboom et al. [ 12] the selectivity to formaldehyde is quite high at near 250, and is affected by the production of dimethyl ether (CH3)20 below this temperature (low conversion) and to COx (mainly CO) at high conversion, above 250. However, Tatiboufit and Germain found a more complex situation [9], as shown in Fig. 1. These authors investigated the effect of reaction conditions on product distribution. They found that the main product at low conversion is the methyl acetale of formaldehyde, i.e. dimethoxymethane (DMM), H2C(OCH3)z, together with smaller amounts of the dehydration product dimethyl ether (CH3)20; by increasing conversion at 190 these authors found formaldehyde to become the predominant product, but at even higher conversion degrees methyl formate HCOOCH3 and, finally, carbon oxides become the predominant products. These authors proposed a rake-type mechanism where adsorbed forms of methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid give rise to desorption of the different products. A kinetic analysis allowed these authors to conclude that formaldehyde and DMM are formed through different routes at first, because the kinetics of their formation follow different orders with respect to oxygen.

More recently, Tatiboufit and Germain [13] and Baiker and Monti [14] studied the effect of microcrystal morphology on methanol oxidation on pure vanadia, searching for structure sensitivity effects. They both reported that the (0 0 1) basal plane of the orthorombic V205 structure [15,16] is less active but more selective towards DMM formation than the side faces, predominantly constituted by the (1 0 0) planes, which do not show specific selectivities. Based on the structure of the (0 0 1) planes of V205, where square pyramidal coordinated vanadium with vanadyl bonds up and down are exposed, Tatiboufit [17] proposed that a surface site constituted by a vanadyl V=O double bond standing up and a near \"oxygen vacancy\" constituted by the sixth coordination of a vanadium (vanadyl down) can be the most appropriate for DMM formation. Gasser and Balker investigated further the effect of the crystallinity [ 18] of V205 on methanol conversion and selectivity to formaldehyde. Working with an amorphous V205 precursor these authors observed strongly increasing catalytic activity with time on stream and considerably higher activities at steady-state than using crystalline V205 (Fig. 2). The ex-amorphous material at steady-state showed to be constituted by a mixture of crystalline V205 and V307, thus showing that amorphous vanadia is more reducible than crystalline V205 and that the presence of reduced centers can be favourable. Busca studied the reaction mechanism for methanol oxidation on pure vanadia with IR spectroscopy [19]. The formation of methoxy groups from methanol dissociative or \"condensative\" adsorption was determined while it was established 390 P.

Reprinted with kind permission from [18]. that formaldehyde (both directly adsorbed or produced by methoxy- groups oxidation) mainly adsorbs in the form of dioxymethylene species, stable only at relatively low temperature. It was concluded that dioxymethylene can react with methanol at low conversion to give rise to DMM while it preferentially desorbs as formaldehyde at higher conversions and temperatures. The weakness of the adsorption of formaldehyde was considered to be the key feature of catalysts allowing high selectivity in formaldehyde synthesis. Busca proposed such a reaction sequence (not dissimilar from the rake-type mechanism previously proposed by Germain and Tatibou& [9]) to occur predominantly on side-faces, like (1 0 0), as shown in Fig. 3. In fact, there incompletely coordinated oxygen and vanadium sites are expected, in contrast to the basal (0 0 1) plane where the coordination is essentially the same as in the overall structure (assuming vanadium pentacoordinated in a distorted square-based pyramid). This is in agreement with the data of Tatibou& and Germain [13] and Baiker and Monti [14] on the effect of microcrystal morphology. Very recently, Sambeth et al. [20] performed an experimental study of the adsorption and oxidation of methanol on sintered polycrystalline vanadia. Among the previously cited oxidation products these authors also detected methoxymetha- nol CH3-O-CH2-OH, i.e. the emiacetal of formaldehyde. The same research group approached more recently the mechanism of methanol oxidation on pure P.

They modeled the interaction of methanol on the basal plane of vanadia (Fig. 4) assuming the methanol oxygen lone pair interacting at the sixth coordination of a square pyramidal vanadium (vanadylic oxygen down) and the C-H bond broken at a vanadyl oxygen (square pyramidal vanadium with vanadylic oxygen up). According to these authors, a good correlation between the potential energy curve and the mechanism was obtained. In other words, Sambeth et al. proposed for formaldehyde formation the same site proposed by Tatibou~t [17] for DMM formation, in contradiction with the data of Tatibou~t and Germain [ 13] and Baiker and Monti [14] and the hypothesis of Busca [19]. Sambeth et al. [21] have also analyzed theoretically the interaction of methanol with different sites, defects of the lattice and (1 0 0) face of V205 where methanol could be adsorbed. Their conclusion is that only the kink can be active in methanol adsorption and oxidation to CO. The comer, the step and the (1 0 0) plane are energetically less favorable than the V=O and V-O-V (0 1 0) \"basal\" plane. As a matter of fact, V205 is more active but less selective than MoO3 in methanol oxidation to formaldehyde [7,8,22]. In effect MoO3 gives rise to very high 392 P. Forzatti et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 387-408 selectivities (>90%) to formaldehyde even at 100% conversion [23] and its performances are further improved by mixing it with Fe203, to form MoO3-excess ferric molybdates, MoO3-Fe2(MoO4)3, that represent the active phases in the industrial catalysts [24,25]. By analogy, attempts have been devoted to improve the catalytic performances of vanadia for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde, by doping, mixing and/or supporting it. 2.2. Methanol oxidation on vanadia-containing mixed oxides and metal vanadates The catalytic performances of vanadia for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde can be improved by mixing V205 with other transition metal oxides. The V2Os- MoO3 system has been the object of a number of studies [8,22,25]. According to both Mann and Dosi [22] and to Ai [8], the V-Mo mixed oxides are more active than molybdena and more selective than vanadia in formaldehyde production. The best composition, however, depends on the reaction conditions. Mann and Dosi [22] found the best formaldehyde yield with a 20% V205-80% MoO3 catalyst at 460. According to Ai [8], when working at 230 the most active composition is 90% V205-10% MOO3. Also the V2Os-WO3 has been the object of several studies [8,26]. Pure WO3 is even less active than MOO3, but again V2Os-WO3 mixed oxides can be more active than the pure oxide components. According to Ai [8], at 320 the optimal composition is 20% V205-80% WO3. As in the case of molybdena, ferric oxide increases the performances of vanadia in formaldehyde synthesis. According to Ediseeva et al. [27] the greatest selectivity is obtained with catalysts were Fe3+ enters in solid solution into V2Os. According to Malinski et al. [28] the best composition for V2Os-Fe203, like for V205-C0304 and V2Os-NiO, is associated with a V to metal atomic ratio ~ 1. However, these authors found hydrogen as a reaction product over V205-Co304 and V2Os-Fe203, suggesting that a dehydrogenative route, more than an oxy-dehydrogenation, occurs over these catalysts. The same authors report that the highest selectivities are obtained with V2Os-NiO, and in this case no hydrogen was found as a product. Also manganese oxide was found to improve the yields of formaldehyde over vanadia-based catalysts, with the best performances for the composition 20% MNO2-80% V205 [29]. The activity of vanadia in methanol oxidation can also be improved by mixing it with K2SO4. Catalysts belonging to this system have been characterized by Monti et al. [30] who showed that they contain, together with the V205 phase, a phase with composition 5VzOs-3KzSO4. These systems are more selective to formalde- hyde than pure vanadia, their activity increasing for 10% K2SO4, but decreasing later [30]. These data show that the reactivity of vanadia-based catalysts in methanol oxidation is sensitive not only to the electronic state of the solid (that P Forzatti et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 387-408 393 is certainly modified when vanadia is mixed with other transition metal oxides) but also to structural (crystallinity) and acid-base features, that are modified by doping with K2504. 2.3. Methanol oxidation on other V-containing bulk solids Pomonis and Vickerman [31] investigated this reaction for catalysts constituted by V-containing solid solutions metal oxides, i.e. V in c~-A1203, SnO: and TiO2 (rutile). Although the matrices are substantially inert, the systems a-Ala_xVxO3 and Snl _xVxO2 give rise to methanol conversions of the order of 100% at 400, with high selectivities to formaldehyde, when x approaches 0.2. The solid solution Ti~_xVxO2 (rutile) is instead almost inert. The authors concluded that a high selectivity is correlated with relatively facile electron exchange between active site cations. More recently, the oxidation of methanol has also been investigated over V- containing heteropolymolybdate catalysts. Brtickman et al. [32] studied the oxidation of methanol over H3+nPVnMOl2_n040 Keggin-type heteropolyacids, bulk or supported on their K-salts. They are quite active, giving rise to methanol conversions of the order of 2-20% in the T-range 200-290. However, in most cases the predominant product was dimethyl ether, together with DMM (up to 40% selectivity) at low temperatures, and formaldehyde at the highest temperatures (up to 50% selectivity). Methyl formate was also observed among the products. It seems that the BrCnsted acidity of these catalysts prevents high formaldehyde selectivity. Sorensen and Weber investigated the catalytic activity of Na3+nPVnW12-nO4o Keggin-type heteropolysalts, together with those of the Keggin-type compounds NasSiVWllO4o and NaTPV14042, all supported on silica [33]. The last catalyst showed the highest activity at 625 K with selectivities to formaldehyde of the order of 80%. These authors found that the turn-over frequency (TOF) calculated for vanadium sites is nearly the same in all cases, is similar to that of vanadia-silica and is independent from the total vanadium loading. These data show that the ability of oxidizing methanol belongs to vanadium centers, almost irrespectively of the structure where they are located and of their environment. 3. Oxide-supported vanadia catalysts To enhance the surface area of vanadia to be used as a catalyst for methanol partial oxidation, it can be supported on high-surface area metal oxides. Several researchers investigated the behavior of vanadia supported on various oxide carriers. However, the results are sometimes apparently contradictory. Roozen- boom et al. [12] found that, for \"monolayer-type\" oxide-supported vanadia 394 P. Forzatti et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 387-408 catalysts, the activity in methanol oxidation follows the trend V2Os-TiO2 (anata- se)>VeOs-ZrO2>V2Os-CeO2>V2Os-A1203>pure V205, but the selectivity to formaldehyde follows nearly the inverse trend. According to Kuenski et al. [34], that also studied \"monolayer-type\" oxide-supported vanadia catalysts in the temperature range 500-670 K, vanadia-silica is very active and very selective to formaldehyde (selectivities near 90%). These authors reported that vanadia- magnesia also gives high selectivities to formaldehyde (70-85%) while they confirmed that vanadia-TiO2 (anatase) is the least selective to formaldehyde, only giving CO and CO2 in their experimental conditions. These data are apparently at variance with the results reported by Deo and Wachs [4,5] concerning low-V-content catalysts: according to these authors at 503 K V2Os-TiO2 (anatase) allows very high activities and also very high selectivities to formaldehyde (95- 99%). The TOF frequencies calculated on vanadium for the oxidation reactions only, measuring the catalytic activity per vanadium centers in oxidation, exhibit the following trend V205-ZrOz>V2Os-TiO2 (anatase)>V205-NbzOs>V2Os-7- AleO3>V205-SiO2, as shown in Table 1. In the conditions they used, formalde- hyde is the primary product except on V2Os-7-A1203 where dimethyl ether is predominantly formed, due to the high dehydrating activity of the uncovered support. On vanadia-zirconia important amounts of methyl formate are observed, again due to the support activity, while on vanadia-niobia dimethyl ether and DMM are also formed in relevant amounts. According to these authors, vanadia-silica has even lower TOF than pure vanadia. Moreover, these authors reported that in their conditions even at higher loadings formaldehyde remains the predominant product and the rate of its formation increases monotonically up to near the monolayer. According to Deo et al. [4] the catalytic activity in methanol oxidation does not correlate with the V=O bond order of surface vanadyls. On the contrary, a good correlation was found with the reducibility of the support. Deo and Wachs [6] also reported that the addition of a second component to V2Os-TiO2 (anatase) can further modify the catalytic properties. They stated that the further addition of W, Nb and Si does not significantly modify the catalytic activity (TOF of vanadium) while the addition of K and P causes the decrease of TOE The addition of P also causes a decrease in formaldehyde selectivity and an increase in dimethyl ether production.

Forzatti et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 387-408 395 Tatibou& [35] investigated the effect of vanadium oxide loading for V2Os-TiO2 (anatase), V2Os-TiO2 (futile) and V205-o~-AI203. In all three cases the rates of formaldehyde and methyl formate production go through a maximum, while that of DMM monotonically increases with vanadium oxide loading. However, the maxima in formaldehyde and methyl formate production rate is located at lower loadings on anatase than on rutile and corundum. More recently, TatibouEt [17] reported further data concerning methanol oxida- tion on rutile-supported vanadia. He observed high selectivities to formaldehyde and DMM. Pretreatment in vacuum should favour the migration of vanadium into the rutile bulk, leading to higher dispersion of isolated vanadyl sites with no Lewis sites in the vicinity. This leads to decreased activities but strongly higher selectivities to formaldehyde. Srivastava and coworkers [36,37] used vanadia-silica doped with alkali metal sulphates in order to study the kinetics of formaldehyde synthesis from methanol partial oxidation. Using K2SO4-V205/SiO2 the following kinetic expression was proposed [36]: r = klPM/[1 q- klPM/(2k2P'5)] in agreement with a Mars-van Krevelen-type mechanism where the methanol oxidation step is first order in methanol partial pressure and the reoxidation step is half-order in oxygen partial pressure. More recently, the same research group [37] suggested that the reoxidation step can also be first order in oxygen, as proposed by Bhattacharya et al. [ 11] on bulk vanadia (see above). It was also shown that K2SO4 is more effective as promoter with respect to Na2SO4 and Li2SO4 [37]. These data show that the catalytic activity of vanadia in methanol oxidation can be deeply influenced by supporting it on different carriers, with or without further doping. However, on the basis of the more detailed studies that also take into account the effect of the process variables on product distribution, performed mainly on bulk vanadia (see above) and on V2Os-TiO2 (anatase) (see below) it seems quite evident that the product selectivities are strongly affected not only by the nature of the carrier-vanadia interaction, but also by the intrinsic activity of the carrier in the same or side reactions, the amount of exposed carrier surface, the vanadia loading, the contact time, the catalyst surface area, the reaction tempera- ture, the gas-phase composition, the conversion degree, and so on. This makes us quite unconfident on the conclusions arising from comparative experiments performed using one single catalyst composition for any system, different carrier surface areas and activities and one reaction condition only. 4. Vanadia-titania (anatase) catalysts As already stated above, V2Os-TiO2 (anatase) looks particularly interesting because of the highest catalytic activity attributed to this system by all authors. It 396 P Forzatti et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 387-408 seems established that TiO2-anatase activates vanadia monolayers enhancing its activity in methanol oxidation [4-6,12,35], as in other oxidation reactions like o- xylene oxidation [38] in the NO-NH3 redox reaction (SCR process [39]) and, possibly, in several other oxidation reactions. However, apparently conflicting data are reported on product selectivities. According to Roozenboom et al. [ 12] and to Kuenski et al. [34] on VzO5-TiO2 (anatase) methanol combustion dominates, while according to Deo and Wachs [4-6] this system gives very high selectivities to formaldehyde. On the other hand, van Hengstum et al. [40] first showed that VzOs- TiO2 (anatase) is able to catalyze with high yields the oxidation of methanol to methyl formate. The same group also reported an IR investigation relative to the mechanism of this reaction [41]. Carlson and Griffin studied the thermal catalytic oxidation of methanol on vanadia-titania and compared the results with those obtained through photooxidation [42]. Both in the dark and under illumination, methyl formate was the main product but illumination had virtually no effect. This contrasts the behavior of MoO3-TiO2 and pure TiO2, where illumination strongly enhances catalytic activity. Few years later, Forzatti and coworkers [43-47] proposed this system for the production of methyl formate from methanol through an oxidative route. Both supported vanadia \"monolayers\" and coprecipitated anatase-type VxTil xO2 solid solutions [48] were found to be similarly active and performant. Vanadia-titania anatase-type solid solutions were also later prepared by Thomas and coworkers [49] who also investigated methanol adsorption [50] and oxidation [51] and found a very high selectivity to methyl formate at intermediate contact times and relatively low vanadia contents. Finally, Van Hengstum et al. [40] showed also that impurities, like P and K, present on the anatase support have a significant role in modifying catalytic activity of vanadia-titania, in line with their influence on the surface acidity. Nevertheless, the main factor causing the differences in product distributions and selectivities reported by various authors seems to lie in the different reaction conditions adopted. As discussed in details in the following sections, in fact, high selectivities in either DMM or formaldehyde, methyl formate and COx can be obtained on vanadia-titania when operating the same catalyst under different conditions. In the following the most significant results of methanol oxidation over V2Os-TiO2 (anatase) are reviewed in relation to the synthesis of methyl formate. 4.1. Catalytic behavior of coprecipitated g205--TiO2 samples: Effects of composition and of the calcination temperature V205-TiO2 oxide catalysts with V/Ti atomic ratios (a.r.) ranging from 0 to 0.25 were prepared by coprecipitation from aqueous solutions of VOC13 and TiC14 and tested in an isothermal fixed-bed microreactor with methanol-air feed mixtures. During the flow reactor experiments, the observed reaction products included HCHO, methyl formate, water, DMM, CO, CO2 and formic acid. Varying the V P.

For the samples calcined at 600, the overall conversion is seen to go through a maximum (V/Ti a.r.=0.0625-0.125), which can be attributed to the contrasting effects resulting from increasing the V loading: while this enhances the oxidizing capacity of the catalyst, it also reduces its surface area. For the same calcination temperature, Fig. 5 shows that a maximum is evident also in the HCOOCH3/HCHO molar ratio. As discussed in a later section, this ratio is of specific interest for the implementation of an industrial process for the production of methyl formate: depending on its value, different process designs have to be considered. As compared to the optimal V content in Fig. 5, the low selectivities to HCOOCH3 corresponding to low and high V contents appear to be associated with poorly active systems due to deficiency of oxidizing capacity, and to deficiency of surface area and excess of V, respectively. This interpretation is consistent with a reaction mechanism where formation of HCOOCH3 occurs consecutively to the formation of HCHO, requiring V-related catalytic centers and adequate surface areas. Fig. 5 shows also how the situation is modified by changes in the catalyst calcination temperature. Higher calcination temperatures correspond to lower surface areas for the same V/Ti a.r., as indicated in Table 2, and also to greater amounts of V at the surface: accordingly, the HCOOCH3/HCHO ratio is seen only to decrease in the case of the catalysts calcined at 700, where the optimal HCOOCH3/HCHO ratio is shifted to lower V loadings; on the other hand, for the 398 P.

Coprecipitated versus impregnated V205--TiO2 catalysts In Fig. 6, the behavior of the coprecipitated catalysts with V/Ti a.r.=0.037 is compared with that of a catalyst prepared by impregnation with a loading sufficient to cover the entire TiO2 surface by a \"monolayer\". The latter was prepared using a Degussa P25 TiO2 support and 10.0% w/w V205, corresponding to a V/Ti a.r.--0.048. The resulting surface area was 48 mE/g. The same general trends are observed; maxima in the selectivities to formaldehyde and to methyl formate, respectively, are apparent in both cases. High temperature adversely affects selectivity to DMM while it enhances the methanol conversion and the selectivity to carbon oxides and to formic acid. The curves are shifted to higher temperatures in the case of the coprecipitated catalyst by nearly 10. Also concerning the effects of the operating variables it was found that the catalysts prepared according to the different methods would yield essentially the same behavior. Accordingly, only results on these aspects obtained over coprecipitated V2Os-TiO2 systems are reported in the next section 4.3. Catalytic behavior of V2Os-TiOe samples: Effects of the process variables The effects of the main process variables, including methanol and water feed concentrations, space velocity, temperature and pressure were investigated over various V2Os-TiO2 catalysts. The 02 feed molar concentration was fixed at ,-~ 10% in all runs in order to remain below the flammability limits of methanol/oxygen mixtures.

Forzatti et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 387-408 effects of the methanol feed level on the concentration of methyl formate in the products and on the HCOOCH3/HCHO molar ratio. Distinct optimal values of the methanol feed content exist for the output concentration of methyl formate and for the HCOOCHa/HCHO ratio. Selectivities to valuable products (HCOOCH3+H- CHO+DMM) in excess of 90% were achieved with methanol concentrations greater than 15%. An excess of methanol enhanced DMM with respect to HCHO, and almost suppressed the formation of CO and CO2. The effect of reaction temperature at two space velocities on the HCOOCH3/ HCHO is presented in Fig. 8 for a catalyst with V/Ti a.r.--0.0375 calcined at 600. Both high temperatures and long contact times are seen to favor methyl formate with respect to formaldehyde, in line with the consecutive nature of the reaction scheme. At temperatures higher than 180, however, a sudden drop in the selectivity to methyl formate has been observed for prolonged contact times. The addition of H20 to the feed was found to depress the overall conversion of methanol, and also reduced the ratio HCOOCH3/HCHO. 16 O -T- L..) t LJ O O T 4 50 f jo. _-- d 160 170 180 190 T(*C) Fig. 8.

The observed effects of the process variables are discussed and interpreted in the following sections in the light of additional findings on the reaction mechanism. 4.4. Injection of probe molecules during methanol oxidation over V2Os-Ti02 oxide catalysts The mechanistic features of the oxidative route to methyl formate over V-Ti oxide catalysts were studied by FF-IR techniques, as reported in the following paragraph, and by running a series of flow reactor experiments where intermediates and reaction products were used as reactants [46]. The results support the reaction scheme presented in Fig. 9, also based on the IR data discussed below, which consists essentially of successive oxidation steps. Each of the steps has received experimental validation by specifically designed flow reactor runs. Thus, in the case of the route leading from formaldehyde to methyl formate, the occurrence of a Cannizzaro-type disproportionation of dioxymethylene (step 11) was confirmed by flow reactor experiments with a HCHO+He feed, where HCOOCH3 was pro- duced. However, the results of similar experiments with a HCHO+O2+He feed show that the oxidation route (step 6) is considerably faster under typical oxidizing reaction conditions. Flow reactor runs with HCOOH in the feed proved that CO and CO2 originate through decomposition of formate groups. The esterification of formate groups to methyl formate appears however to be faster than their decomposition, provided that methanol is available in the reaction mixture. 4.5. Spectroscopic studies of methanol oxidation over V2Os-Ti02 (anatase) Methanol adsorption gives rise to methoxy-groups that are responsible for the sharp CH3 stretching bands at 2935 and 2830 cm-~ and for the deformation mode split at 1452 (shoulder) and 1438 cm-1 (Fig. 10 (a) and (b)).

At this temperature (Fig. 10(c)) the features of formate species, responsible for the strong bands at 1565, 1540 cm-1 (asymmetric COO stretchings) and at 1370, 1358 cm-1 (symmetric COO stretch- ings), as well as for weak bands (a combination mode and the C-H stretching) at 2972 and 2883 cm-1, dominate the spectrum. However, weak bands at 1645 and 1300 cm-1 can be assigned to adsorbed formaldehyde. Formate species are stable in the adsorbed form up to near 220 but later tend to decompose to COx. If formaldehyde is directly adsorbed at r.t. on vanadia-titania, dioxymethylene species appears to be the key adsorbed form of formaldehyde [44,52]. This species is stable up to 100 and, in any case, is strongly bonded giving rise, upon heating, to both methoxy and formate groups (reaction 7 in the scheme of Fig. 9) by a Cannizzaro-type disproportionation, or, by oxidation, to formate groups only. This behavior may be interpreted assuming that the desorption of formaldehyde from dioxymethylene species is slow on vanadia-titania, as on many other oxides, and oxidation or disproportionation may occur. In the presence of methanol at relatively low temperature dioxymethylene reacts with methanol giving rise to P. Forzatti et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 387-408 403 DMM, that in fact is produced with high selectivity at low conversion. Formate species are also quite stable so that their reaction with methanol gives rise to methyl formate. The data discussed above allowed us to propose the reaction scheme reported in Fig. 9 as a generalized mechanism for methanol oxidation over metal oxides [53]. From this mechanism it is evident that the products formaldehyde, DMM, methyl formate and CO are substantially successive oxidation products, being their adsorbed forms converted one into the other, giving rise to a so-called rake-type mechanism. So, on active and selective oxidation catalysts, the selectivity to these products does depend strongly on experimental conditions like contact time or space velocity in relation to the catalyst surface area. As shown above, over pure vanadia and vanadia-titania all products can be formed with rather high selectiv- ities at different conversion levels. Methyl formate and DMM are evidently formed by reaction of an oxidized adsorbed species with unreacted methanol, so their production necessarily occurs at incomplete methanol conversion. Among active oxidation catalysts, where methoxy groups oxidation (step 2) starts at sufficiently low temperatures to avoid substantial condensation to dimethyl ether (step 11), catalysts giving high yields in formaldehyde (like pure V205) allow desorption of this molecule (step 3) before its further oxidation (step 6) or disproportionation (step 10). Characterization studies of pure V205 [54] showed that its surface anionic sites are poorly nucleophilic, thus inducing a sufficient thermal lability of dioxymethylene with respect to its desorption as formaldehyde (steps 4 and 3). This agrees with the fact that pure V205 is poorly active in the Tischenko dimerization of formaldehyde to methyl formate [55], for which the equilibrium 4 is necessarily shifted towards dioxymethylene. VzO5-TiO2 differs from pure V205 because (among other things) surface vanadyl centers interact with Ti cations with ionic V-O... Ti bonds, so that surface oxide species take higher nucleophilicity. Thus, over VzOs-TiO2 formal- dehyde is blocked as dioxymethylene allowing a further oxidation and dispro- portionation, giving finally formate ions. On the other hand, formate ions were found to be not so labile, allowing the reaction of these species with unreacted methanol giving methyl formate (step 8) before formates were decomposed into CO (step 7). 4.6. The reaction mechanism and the process variables The reaction scheme proposed above in Fig. 9 agrees with the observed effects of the process variables [45-47]. The comparison of the activities of catalysts having the same composition but different surface areas, owing to different calcination temperatures, as well as to different vanadium contents, points out the consecutive nature of the reaction network. In fact, on increasing the surface area the activity increases and the selectivity is displaced from the intermediate products (formaldehyde and DMM) to the end product methyl formate. The 404 P. Forzatti et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 387-408 overoxidation product CO becomes eventually predominant either at prolonged contact times or at the onset of interphase diffusional limitations. On the other hand, the conversion is depressed on increasing the methanol/oxygen feed ratio, whereas selectivities to intermediate products increase strongly due to the decreased availability of oxygen. In all cases the product ratio DMM/formalde- hyde depends on the methanol availability (i.e. depends inversely on the methanol conversion), confirming the role of equilibrium 4. The effect of the CH3OH feed concentration can be rationalized by observing that, for CH3OH <10%, the excess of oxygen favors the oxidation steps, leading preferentially to the terminal products HCOOCH3, CO and HCOOH. On increas- ing the methanol feed content, the steps involving gaseous methanol are benefi- cially affected, resulting first in a decreased selectivity to CO and HCOOH, corresponding to an increased selectivity to HCOOCH3, and finally in enhanced selectivities to HCHO and particularly to DMM. The data in Fig. 8 are explained considering that an increase in temperature and contact time results in enhanced methanol conversions, and reduces the concentration of gaseous methanol. Accordingly, first the selectivity to HCOOCH3 grows at the expense of HCHO+DMFL, then the selectivity to CO is favored at the expense of methyl formate. Catalytic tests and IR adsorption studies for the oxidation of methanol over pure Tit2 [56,57] have demonstrated the fundamental role of vanadium in the oxidative steps of the mechanism (steps 2 and 6 in Fig. 9). 4.7. Process considerations Inspection of the data collected in flow reactor runs over various V205-TiO2 catalysts indicates that the production of methyl formate is always accompanied by the formation of formaldehyde. It is worth stressing however that the ratio HCOOCH3/I-ICHO can be adjusted within a large range of values by appropriate choices of both the catalyst preparation parameters and of the reaction conditions. Concerning the V/Ti a.r. and the catalyst calcination temperature, Fig. 5 shows the existence of different optimum combinations, depending on the activation tem- perature: for Tc=600, the selectivity to methyl formate relative to HCHO is maximum at V/Ti a.r.=0.0375. Also the reaction temperature, the space velocity and the methanol feed content exhibited complex effects on the distribution of reaction products. In the case of a process for the production of methyl formate only, it is desired to optimize its formation. Values of HCOOCH3/HCHO as high as 20 can be achieved, corresponding to weight ratios=40/1, with productivities to HCOOCH3 exceeding 200 g/lh. Alternatively, the V2Os-TiO2 catalysts appear suitable also for the industrial coproduction of HCOOCH3 and HCHO by the mild gas-phase oxidation of methanol. In this case, the ratio of HCOOCH3/HCHO is expected to have a strong impact on the design of the separation section of such a process, for which a tentative schematic diagram is given in Fig. 11. The front end of the separation P. Forzatti et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 387-408 405 _OFF GASES AIR c oHI Y HCHO __,. + H20 + (CH3OH) HCOOC H 3 CH30H Fig. 11.

Reprinted with kind permission from [47]. section (units 1 and 2) is devoted to the separation of HCHO, which is dissolved in water, and to the concentration of the resulting aqueous solution. The remaining separation units effect removal from the gaseous stream of the inert gases (unit 3), which may be in part recycled to dilute the oxygen in the air feed stream, of methyl formate (unit 4), and eventually of unreacted methanol (unit 5), which is recirculated to the synthesis section. In this scheme, the trickiest section is that effecting separation of formaldehyde, its target being the production of a com- mercial aqueous solution of HCHO. If concentration of the solution is required, a lower bound exists on the acceptable content of formaldehyde in the reaction products. This implies that it may be desirable to design operation of the reactor without necessarily maximizing the HCOOCH3/HCHO ratio. Preliminary calculations of the separation section were performed assuming a reactor outlet stream containing 10.5 % H20 and 1.5% HCHO. Results demonstrate that concentrations of HCHO of 20% w/w and more in the final solution are feasible by operating units 1 and 2 under slight pressure. Polymerization of HCHO can be prevented by admitting a small concentration of residual methanol in the final solution. Energetic considerations are also relevant. The heat of hydration of formaldehyde is about 15 kcal/mol, which could be possibly exploited for auto- thermal operation. In summary, the choice of the working conditions of the reactor appears to be controlled by a compromise between the increase in revenues expected from 406 P. Forzatti et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 387-408 maximization of the HCOOCH3 production and the increased costs resulting from concentration of more dilute aqueous solutions of HCHO. Eventually, the balance can be determined only on the basis of a detailed economic analysis, which can however take advantage of the several degrees of freedom available in order to optimize the overall performances of the process. 5. Conclusions The data reported in this work show that vanadium oxide sites exhibit significant activity in the oxidation of methanol almost irrespective of the matrix or of the support on which they are located. However, the neighbors greatly affect both activity and selectivity. In previous papers we already proposed that a key factor allowing high selectivities in formaldehyde is the absence of very nucleophilic oxygen species able to attack the carbonyl carbon atom of formaldehyde. On the contrary, the existence of surface oxygen species with sufficient nucleophylicity allows formaldehyde to be strongly adsorbed in the form of dioxymethylene, which eventually results in methyl formate with high selectivities. High nucleo- philicity of the surface anions coupled with very high activity would result in combustion catalysis. When vanadium oxide is pure or is interacting with oxides of high-oxidation state and poorly electronegative elements, oxygen species are very covalently bonded and, consequently, poorly nucleophylic. This results in catalysts quite selective for formaldehyde. When, on the contrary, vanadium oxide is mixed with or supported on metals in lower oxidation states with quite ionic VO-M bonds, selectivity to methyl formate can be higher. However, the data in the present paper also suggest that the electronic interaction of vanadium oxide species with semiconductor solids or with transition metal cations allows electron exchanges which favorably affect catalytic activity. As a final remark, it may be worth noticing that the investigation of methanol oxidation over V-based systems has eventually resulted in addressing a number of fundamental issues in heterogeneous catalysis, particularly in the area of structure/ activity/selectivity relationships. While this work appears to be still at a pre- liminary stage, it can expectedly produce rewarding results in the near future.
