DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60337-9 ARTICLE Effect of La 2 O 3 on Microstructure and Catalytic Performance of CuO/CeO 2 Catalyst in Water-Gas Shift Reaction FANG Xing, CHEN Chongqi, LIN Xingyi*, SHE Yusheng, ZHAN Yingying, ZHENG Qi National Engineering Research Center of Chemical Fertilizer Catalyst, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, China Abstract: The water-gas shift reaction was used to evaluate a series of La 2 O 3 modified CuO/CeO 2 catalysts that were prepared by a parallel co-precipitation method. The catalytic activity and thermal stability improved significantly upon the introduction of La 2 O 3 , and CuO/CeO 2 -La 2 O 3 (2 wt%) gave the highest activity and had the best thermal stability. The microstructure of the as-prepared CuO/CeO 2 -La 2 O 3 catalysts and/or the CeO 2 -La 2 O 3 supports was characterized by X-ray diffraction, N 2 physisorption, Raman spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction. The results indicate that larger specific surface areas and smaller crystal sizes of CuO and CeO 2 result in improved catalytic performance for the as-prepared catalysts. Moreover, the incorporation of La 3+ into the ceria lattice promotes the generation of oxygen vacancies leading to a higher number of moderate copper oxides that interact with surface oxygen vacancies on the surface of the ceria. This enhances the activity and thermal stability of the CuO/CeO 2 catalyst. Key words: copper oxide; ceria; lanthanum oxide; water-gas shift reaction; oxygen vacancy; Raman spectroscopy Faced with massive and ever-growing energy demands, fuel cells are considered to be one of the most effective and envi- ronmental friendly technologies for the production of electric energy. Hydrogen is the most promising fuel for fuel cells and it can be produced by water-splitting, biomass, and the refor- mation of hydrocarbons [1,2]. However, most of the H 2 pro- duced by reforming hydrocarbons contains a certain amount of CO, which has side effects in fuel cells such as the degradation of the Pt electrode performance [2â€“4]. Therefore, it is neces- sary to purify the syngas before it becomes a feasible fuel source for low-temperature fuel cells and other relevant areas. The water-gas shift (WGS) reaction (CO + H 2 O CO 2 + H 2 ) is a vital process in eliminating CO and producing H 2 in low-temperature fuel cell system. The design of active, stable, and poison-resistant catalysts for the WGS reaction has been of great interest recently. Ceria is a good support for metal and metal oxide catalysts because of its high oxygen storage ability, which plays an important role in redox reaction [3â€“11]. Ceria supported cata- lysts are considered as promising candidates for the WGS reaction, emissions-control, hydrocarbon-reforming, and hy- drocarbon oxidation catalysis [5,7â€“10]. For all these applica- tions, CeO 2 has been used as a support for both noble and cheap metals or metal oxides such as Au/CeO 2 , Pt/CeO 2 , and CuO/CeO 2 as it has the ability to cycle between Ce 3+ and Ce 4+ [8â€“13]. Compared with the precious metals based on ceria, the WGS catalysts loaded with transition metal (e.g. Co, Ni or Cu) oxides are of growing interest because of their significantly lower cost. Metal oxides with valences lower than (4+) are commonly introduced to modify the catalytic performance of CuO/CeO 2 catalysts, such as La 2 O 3 [9,14,15], Y 2 O 3 [15,16], Al 2 O 3 [17], Fe 2 O 3 [18], and ZnO [19] etc. Li et al. [14] reported that Cu and Ni supported on La-doped-ceria retained high catalytic activity in a lower-temperature WGS reaction. Zhi et al. [9] investi- gated the influence of the preparation method on the per- formance of a CuO/CeO 2 -La 2 O 3 catalyst. She et al. [15] carried out a comparative study of the WGS reaction using a series of CuO/CeO 2 catalysts doped with trivalent rare earth oxides (RE 2 O 3 , RE = Y, La, Nd, and Sm). It was found that introduc- FANG Xing et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 425â€“431 tion of La 2 O 3 promotes the generation of oxygen vacancies in ceria because the ionic radius and electronegativity of La 3+ are close to that of Ce 4+ [8,9,14,15]. To date no work has been carried out to determine the microstructure and catalytic per- formance of CuO/CeO 2 catalysts modified with different amounts of La 2 O 3 for the WGS reaction. In this work, CuO/CeO 2 catalysts modified with La 2 O 3 were synthesized by co-precipitation and were calcined at 650 Â°C. The as-prepared CuO/CeO 2 -La 2 O 3 catalysts had dissimilar structures and redox properties and exhibited different catalytic performance for the WGS reaction when different amounts of lanthanum were introduced. The CuO/CeO 2 catalyst modified with (2 wt%) La 2 O 3 showed the highest WGS reaction catalytic performance. The catalyst microstructures and catalytic per- formance were fully investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N 2 -physisorption, Raman spectroscopy, and tempera- ture-programmed reduction (TPR) characterization, and the results are discussed in detail. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation A series of CuO/CeO 2 -La 2 O 3 catalysts with 25 wt. % CuO and a specific La 2 O 3 content (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 wt. %, cal- culated as La 2 O 3 ) were prepared by the parallel co-precipitation method. The as-prepared samples were denoted as CCL0, CCL1, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5, respectively. Typically, stoichiometric amounts of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 Â·3H 2 O, Ce(NO 3 ) 3 Â·6H 2 O, and La(NO 3 ) 3 Â·6H 2 O were initially dissolved in deionized water and, subsequently, the mixed aqueous solution was co-precipitated with an aqueous solution of KOH under vig- orous stirring at 80 Â°C and at a pH of 10. A black suspension was acquired and aged with continuous stirring at 80 Â°C for another 6 h. The resulting precipitate was centrifuged and washed with deionized water several times and then dried at 110 Â°C for 12 h and finally calcined at 650 Â°C for 4 h (heating rate was 5 Â°C/min) in air. 1.2 Evaluation of catalytic performance The catalytic activities and thermal stabilities of the catalysts for the WGS reaction were evaluated in a fixed bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst (30â€“40 mesh) was placed between two layers of quartz granules within a stainless steel tube (i.d. = 12 mm) and evaluated from 200 to 400 Â°C at an interval of 50 Â°C for the first cycle. The ratio of vapor to feed gas (10% CO, 60% H 2 , 12% CO 2 , and balance N 2 ) was main- tained at 1:1, and the space velocity was kept at 4500 h â€“1 . Re- sidual water from the outlet was removed by a condenser be- fore entry into a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) to monitor the outlet gas concen- tration of CO. After the first cycle the catalyst was kept at 400 Â°C for 12 h and then the temperature was decreased to 200 Â°C. The catalyst was then evaluated from 200 to 400 Â°C again for another cycle. Catalyst stability was also evaluated at a given temperature (ramp to 300 Â°C from room temperature and kept at 300 Â°C for 24 h). The activity is expressed by the conversion of CO and is defined as X CO = (1 â€“ V' CO /V CO ) Ã— 100%/(1 + V' CO ), where V CO and V' CO are the inlet and outlet CO contents, re- spectively. 1.3 Characterization Powder XRD patterns of the as-synthesized samples were collected on a PANalytical Xâ€™ pert Pro diffractometer equipped with Co ( = 0.17902 nm) radiation operating at 40 kV and 40 mA for 2 angles ranging from 25Â° to 75Â°. Crystal sizes of the ceria and the copper oxide were determined from peak broadening with the Scherrer equation. The specific surface areas (S BET ) were measured on an ASAP 2020 physical ad- sorption analyzer at â€“196 Â°C using nitrogen as the adsorption gas. Before each analysis the sample was degassed at 200 Â°C for 3 h. Raman spectra were obtained on a Renishaw Invia Plus system at ambient temperature. The emission line at 514.5 nm from an Ar + ion laser (Spectra Physics) was focused on the sample under the microscope. H 2 -TPR measurements were carried out on an AutoChem 2910 instrument. The samples were pretreated under pure helium gas at 300 Â°C for 30 min and then the system was cooled to ambient temperature. Subse- quently, H 2 -TPR was performed by passing 10% H 2 -90% Ar (flowing rate = 30 ml/min) over 50 mg catalyst at a heating rate of 10 Â°C/min from room temperature to 400 Â°C. The hydrogen consumption was monitored using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalytic performance Figure 1 shows the results of the catalytic activity tests for the as-synthesized catalysts where the catalytic activity is expressed as CO conversion versus temperature. As shown in Fig. 1, the catalytic activity of the CuO/CeO 2 catalyst is ap- parently enhanced by the introduction of La 2 O 3 . The CCL2 sample gave the highest CO conversion during the whole testing temperature region, and this was as high as 93.1% at 250 Â°C for the first cycle, which is 9.6% higher than that of CCL0 (83.5%). However, the catalytic activities decrease rapidly as the amount of La 2 O 3 increased further. A comparison between the first and the second cycle in Fig. 1 reveals that the thermal stability of the CuO/CeO 2 catalyst can also be im- proved by the introduction of La 2 O 3 , especially for the CCL2 sample. Moreover, the thermal stabilities of the La 2 O 3 modified CuO/CeO 2 catalysts were also investigated by keeping the FANG Xing et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 425â€“431 catalyst at 300 Â°C for 24 h under feed gas flow and the results are shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2 also shows that deactivation during the stability test increased as follows: CCL2 < CCL3 < CCL5 < CCL1 < CCL0 indicating that the thermal stability of the as-synthesized samples decreased as follows: CCL2 > CCL3 > CCL5 > CCL1 > CCL0. Therefore, the CCL2 sample gave the best catalytic performance among the as-obtained catalysts. 2.2 Microstructure The crystal structure of the La 2 O 3 modified ceria supports and the CuO/CeO 2 catalysts were determined by XRD char- acterization and the results are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. No diffraction line for lanthanum or lanthanum derivatives is present in either figure. All the diffraction peaks are assigned to CeO 2 (JCPDS 34-0394) and CuO (JPCDS 05-0661), and the full width at the half maximum (FWHM) as well as the inten- sity of the diffraction peaks are different form each other. Ad- ditionally, cell parameters, crystal sizes, and lattice strain val- ues of the samples were calculated and are presented in Table 1. Figure 3 is the XRD patterns of the ceria supports. It is il- lustrated that the structure of CeO 2 is significantly affected by the introduction of La. The cell parameters of CeO 2 (â€œaCeO 2 â€� in Table 1) change according to an increase in the amount of La 2 O 3 , indicating that the La 3+ ions might be incorporated into the lattices of the ceria supports because the ionic radius of La 3+ (0.116 nm) is larger than that of Ce 4+ (0.092 nm). Moreover, variations in the intensities of those diffraction peaks and the crystal sizes of the ceria supports with different amounts of La 2 O 3 suggest that the incorporation of La 2 O 3 prohibits the crystal growth of ceria. Furthermore, from Table 1, the lattice strain of CeO 2 increases accordingly when the amount of in- troduced La was increased suggesting that a small amount of La 3+ ions were incorporated into the ceria fluorite lattice. A slightly beneficial effect for the specific surface area of the bare support was also found because of the lanthanum loading. For the CuO/CeO 2 -La 2 O 3 samples (Fig. 4), the diffraction peaks centered at 2 = 41.5Â°, 46Â°, and 57.5Â° can be indexed to the monoclinic CuO structure.

FANG Xing et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 425â€“431 creases when a small amount of La 2 O 3 (less than 5 wt%) is introduced, however, there is no difference between CCL0 and CCL5 (5 wt%) and the variation in the CuO crystal sizes of the CuO/CeO 2 -La 2 O 3 samples shows the same trend as those of CeO 2 . By comparing the cell parameters of the supports with the as-prepared catalysts (Table 1), smaller â€œaCeO 2 â€� values for those catalysts suggest the incorporation of Cu 2+ (0.072 nm) into the ceria lattice. It can be concluded that the decrease in crystal size with an increase in lattice strain can be attributed to the interaction between the mismatch-lattices in the La-modified-catalyst, and this is in agreement with previous studies [15â€“17]. It is worth noting that CCL2 gives the highest amount of lattice strain (2.049% for CeO 2 and 0.422% for CuO) and the highest specific surface area (53 m 2 /g). There- fore, when the amount of La 2 O 3 is lower than 2 wt. %, the segregation effect of La 2 O 3 is dominant in the CuO/CeO 2 -La 2 O 3 catalysts. When it is higher than 2 wt. % the lanthanum oxide may partially cover the copper oxide crystal- lites and disturb the interaction between copper and ceria leading to a decrease in copper oxide dispersion [17,20]. It has been reported that upon doping with trivalent ions the crystal lattice of ceria must compensate for the excess negative charge by three mechanisms [21]: vacancy compensation, cerium interstitial compensation, and dopant interstitial com- pensation. For small cations (such as Al 3+ ), vacancy compen- sation is accompanied by dopant interstitial compensation. For Me 3+ dopants (radius > 0.08 nm), the charge compensation is achieved by creating vacancies [21]. It is concluded from the above XRD analysis that the La 3+ ions are embedded within the ceria lattice. Therefore, as the ionic radius of the dopant-La 3+ (0.116 nm) is larger than 0.08 nm the generation of oxygen vacancies is the preferred route for charge compensation in the ceria lattice. In order to study this in more detail, structural studies of the as-synthesized La 2 O 3 modified CuO/CeO 2 cata- lysts were complemented by the Raman technique using a laser at 514.5 nm as the excitation source and the results are shown in Fig. 5. As shown in the Raman spectra, a strong main line at about 462 cm â€“1 and a broad band at around 600 cm â€“1 are clearly present for each sample. The peak at about 462 cm â€“1 can be assigned to the triply degenerate F 2g mode and appears as a symmetric breathing mode of the oxygen atoms around the Ce 4+ ions [22]. For the CuO/CeO 2 catalysts modified with La 2 O 3 the peaks at about 462 cm â€“1 shift obviously to lower wavenumbers, and this is because of the decrease in the surface particle sizes and changes in the Ce 4+ ion environment in the presence of oxygen vacancies [23â€“25]. The broad band at 600 cm â€“1 is assigned to the generation of oxygen vacancies because of the existence of lower valance (2+ and/or 3+) ions in the ceria structure [26] and the intensities of the broad band change significantly and follow the sequence: CCL2 > CCL3 > CCL1 > CCL5 > CCL0. Consequently, oxygen vacancies exist in the CuO/CeO 2 -La 2 O 3 catalysts because of the introduction of La 2 O 3 while the CCL2 sample possesses the largest amount of oxygen vacancies. 2.3 Reduction properties 30 40 50 60 70 CeO 2 (5) (4) (3) (2) I n t e n s i t y 2 /( o ) (1) CuO Fig. 4.

All the profiles in Fig. 6 can be fitted to three peaks by the Gauss-Lorentz method: a small reduction peak around 132 Â°C, and a pair of overlapping peaks at 170 and 200 Â°C, denoted as , , and and the details are summarized in Table 2. The assignments of the , , and peaks were carried out by treating the catalysts with an (NH 4 ) 2 CO 3 solution in our previous studies [13,27]. We con- cluded that the peak comes from the reduction of finely dispersed CuO species, which is in close contact with ceria; the peak is due to the reduction of copper oxide (crystalline) with a moderate crystal size that interacts with the surface oxygen vacancies of ceria; while, the peak is attributed to the reduc- tion of a small part of the surface ceria, the copper oxide in- corporated into the ceria lattice, and the large isolated copper oxide phase (crystalline), which is not interacted with ceria support. It is evident that the presence of La 2 O 3 affects the reduction properties of the CuO/CeO 2 catalysts. As for the peaks, the peak areas are almost identical while the reduction tempera- tures increase as follows: CCL0 < CCL1 < CCL2 < CCL3 < CCL5. The reduction temperatures of the and peaks in the overlapping peaks increased as follows: CCL2 < CCL1 < CCL0 < CCL3 < CCL5. Moreover, the percentages of peak area for the peaks are 22.3%, 25.4%, 31.8%, 29.8%, and 23.7% for CCL0, CCL1, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5, respec- tively, and this is considered to be the most important factor in obtaining high catalytic activity for the CuO/CeO 2 catalyst [13]. Zhi et al. [9] reported that the existence of surface copper oxide (crystalline) is vital for high activity and thermal stability for the Cu-Ce-La mixed oxide catalyst. It has now been dem- onstrated that the CCL2 catalyst possesses the highest amount of copper oxides with a moderate crystal size that interacts with the surface oxygen vacancies of ceria, which promotes its catalytic activity and thermal stability and this is due to the CCL2 possessing the most oxygen vacancies. A correlation to the strong metal-support interaction and the presence of multiple cation-oxygen bond distances other than the single cation-oxygen bond distance in the pure ceria lattice will introduce a large strain in the oxide lattice with a re- markable increase in the lattice strains [28,29]. The important roles of the oxygen vacancies and the Cu-O vacancy interface in Cu-based catalysts have also been suggested to be vital promoters in H 2 O dissociation and the generation of catalyti- cally active sites during the WGS reaction [30,31]. Obviously, the excellent catalytic performance of the CuO/CeO 2 catalyst is greatly facilitated by the introduction of an appropriate amount of La 2 O 3 . By correlating with the above-mentioned charac- terization results the optimum WGS reaction catalytic per- formance of the CCL2 catalysts is due to its largest specific surface area and lattice strain, its smallest CuO and CeO 2 par- ticles, and the largest number of oxygen vacancies. The addi- tion of a large amount of La 2 O 3 leads to less desirable micro- structures and to a decrease in catalytic performance. 3 Conclusions Excellent catalytic activity and thermal stability of CuO/CeO 2 catalysts for the WGS reaction were obtained by the addition of La 2 O 3 . The lanthanum is incorporated into the ceria lattice resulting in increases in the specific surface area and in lattice strain, a decrease in particle size and a promotion of the generation of oxygen vacancies, which enhances their catalytic performance. In particular, the CuO/CeO 2 -La 2 O 3 (2 wt. %) catalyst exhibits the best catalytic activity and thermal stability due to its large specific surface area and lattice strain, its smallest CuO and CeO 2 particles and its large number of oxygen vacancies.

ARTICLE Effect of La2O3 on Microstructure and Catalytic Performance of CuO/CeO2 Catalyst in Water-Gas Shift Reaction Xing FANG Chongqi CHEN Xingyi LIN * Yusheng SHE Yingying ZHAN Qi ZHENG National Engineering Research Center of Chemical Fertilizer Catalyst, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, China * Corresponding author. Tel: +86-591-83731234-8112; Fax: +86-591-83738808 The water-gas shift reaction was used to evaluate a series of La2O3 modified CuO/CeO2 catalysts that were prepared by a parallel co-precipitation method. The catalytic activity and thermal stability improved significantly upon the introduction of La2O3, and CuO/CeO2-La2O3 (2 wt%) gave the highest activity and had the best thermal stability. The microstructure of the as-prepared CuO/CeO2-La2O3 catalysts and/or the CeO2-La2O3 supports was characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 physisorption, Raman spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction. The results indicate that larger specific surface areas and smaller crystal sizes of CuO and CeO2 result in improved catalytic performance for the as-prepared catalysts. Moreover, the incorporation of La3+ into the ceria lattice promotes the generation of oxygen vacancies leading to a higher number of moderate copper oxides that interact with surface oxygen vacancies on the surface of the ceria. This enhances the activity and thermal stability of the CuO/CeO2 catalyst. 摘要 以 La2O3 为助剂, 采用共沉淀法制备了具有良好催化活性和热稳定性的 CuO/CeO2-La2O3 水煤气变换反应催化剂, 其中, 当 La2O3 含量为 2 wt% 时, 催化剂的催化性能最为优异. 同时运用 X 射线衍射、N2 吸附-脱附、Raman 光谱、程序升温还原等手段, 研究了不同含量的 La2O3 对 CuO/CeO2 催化剂微观结构及催化性能的影响. 结果表明, La2O3 助剂进入了载体 CeO2 的晶格并对 CuO/CeO2 催化剂的微观结构和催化性能产生了直接影响, 适量 La2O3 的添加可以抑制 CuO 和 CeO2 晶格的长大、增强 CuO 与 CeO2 间的相互作用、提高催化剂的比表面积、促进 CeO2 载体中生成更多的氧空位, CuO/CeO2 催化剂的催化活性和热稳定性也明显改善.
