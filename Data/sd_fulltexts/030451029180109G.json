(Received January 21, 1991; accepted May 24, 1991) Abstract New supported nickel catalysts for ethylene oligomerization have been obtained by the reaction of the nickel complex (I) with functional groups of modified silica (or alumina) or with magnesium hydride. O PO3 /N\\ HO - P Ph I Silica and alumina were modified by treatment with Al(CH3)3 or with Ti(CHZ-CBH6),. A number of the synthesized catalysts exhibit high activity and high selectivity in ethylene oligomerization. At high temperature (above 90 C) some catalysts produced a mixture of linear a-olefins and polymer. Experimental data on the interaction of the Ni complex I with the different supports and the composition of the surface Ni complexes are reported. Introduction The oligomerization of a-olefins in the presence of homogeneous Ni-chelate complexes has been studied extensively [1, 2]. In most cases, the homogeneous Ni-chelate complexes exhibit high activity and selectivity for the formation of linear a-olefins in the range Cg - CZO. Supporting the Ni-chelate complex II on silica or on silica-alumina usually leads to active catalysts in ethylene oligomerization, although with lower activity and selectivity in comparison to homogeneous complexes; in addition, the heterogenized Ni-chelate complex II gives rise to double bond isomerization in the products [3]. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/91/$3.50 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 130 Ph O PPh3 Ni P Ph Ph 2 u The activity and selectivity rise again, if the supports are used after having been modified by reaction with Al(CH3)3 [4]. Unfortunately we were not able to clarify the mechanism of interaction. In the present work the synthesis of another type of highly active supported nickel catalyst is described. The underlying principle is the chemical attack of the hydroxy group of a homogeneous nickel complex on the modifier already having modified the silica or the alumina. Subsequently, the same nickel complex is reacted with magnesium hydride immediately. Experimental All experiments were carried out under an argon atmosphere or in vacuo. Silica (Davison 952) with a surface area of 260 m2 g-' and a pore volume of 1.6 cm' g-', alumina (Degussa) (S=80 m2 g-1, V=0.6 cm3 g-') and magnesium hydride (S=80 m2 g-') were used as supports. Prior to supporting the Ni complex, the silica and alumina were heated in air at 730 K for 6-8 h, then in vacuo at 630 K for 4 h. Magnesium hydride was prepared using the method described by Bogdanovic et al. [5]. Al(CH3)3 (or Ti(CH2-C6H5)4) was supported on silica and on alumina from pentane solution. CH4 evolved was determined by capillary gas chromatography. Excess Al(CH3)3 was removed by washing the support with pentane. The supported titanium hydrides were prepared using the method described previously [ 6 ] by treatment of the supported titanium alkyl with hydrogen at 130 C for 0.5 h. Nickel complex I was prepared using the conventional method described by Gruber [7]. The supports were treated with toluene solution of the Ni complex I at 293-323 K. The catalytic oligomerization of ethylene was performed in a 200 ml stainless steel autoclave with a magnetic stirrer under an ethylene pressure of 40-60 bar. In a typical experiment, a toluene solution of Ni complex I or suspension of ~ 0.1 g catalyst in toluene was used. The selectivity of the catalyst (in oligomerizing ethylene preferentially) was determined by capillary gas chromatography of the products. Results and discussion Three different methods were used for the preparation of the supported Ni catalysts. Ni complex I was supported on: 131 (1) silica and alumina, modified by treatment with AI(CH3)3; (2) silica, containing on the surface a titanium alkyl or a titanium hydride compound; (3) magnesium hydride. Catalyst: Ni-complex 1/SiOZ(AL203)/AL(CH3)3 Surface hydroxy groups of silica and alumina react with Al(CH3)3 through the well-known reaction (1): (E-OH)n,+Al(CH3)3 --~ (E-0-),Al(CH3)3-.n+nCH4 (1) n,=1, 2; E=Si, Al When modified by reaction (1), the silica contains 0.6 wt.% Al. Reacting the modified silica with the Ni complex I yields CH4 at ratios Ni:CH4 =1:1 and CH4:AI = 0.8:1, in good agreement with the analytically obtained ratio Ni:Al = 0.78 in catalyst III. Thus we may assume that the surface aluminum-methyl bonds were cleaved by the hydroxy groups of the Ni complex I, e.g. as follows: O PPh3 -0 Ni Si 02_1 Al -CH3 + HO P Ph O I O PPhy -0 Ni SinO2n-1 Al -O P Ph + CHI 0 III In contrast, when the Ni complex II [4], containing no hydroxy groups, was supported on Si02 modified with Al(CH3)3, it was found that the catalyst contained only 0.07 wt.% Ni and that the Nl/Al molar ratio was - 0.053. After reaction between the Ni complex I and the supports Si02/AI(CH3)3 and A1203/AI(CH3)3, the intensity of the absorption band at 2966 cm' characterising the v(CH3) in the surface aluminum-methyl compounds decreased. For the Si02-supported catalyst III, the IR spectra showed absorption bands at 1575, 1445,1389 and 1340 cm-', whereas for the catalyst supported on A1203 the absorption bands were observed at 1564, 1463, 1439, 1393 and 1340 cm-'. According to [7], the homogeneous complex I exhibits absorption bands at 1445, 1389, 1393, 1463, and 1439 cm-' which characterize phenyl and phosphine ligands, whereas the absorption bands 1575, 1564 and 1340 cm-' characterize the (P, O) chelate ligand. Moreover, the Ni:P molar ratio in the catalysts is about 1.8. These data. indicate that the Ni complex I reacts with surface Al-alkyl groups, as shown in reaction (2). 132 Thus the heterogenization procedure does not alter the O-Ni-P partial structure. Accordingly, structure IIi is presumed to represent the surface Ni-complexes synthesized. The catalysts exhibit high activity and high selectivity in ethylene oligomerization (Table 1). However the activity of the Ni complex on silica is considerably higher than the activity of the homogeneous Ni complex or the Ni complex on alumina. For both catalysts the activity increases when the reaction temperature is increased from 313 to 363 K. The distribution of the products for homogeneous and supported Ni complexes is different. Supported Ni complexes give a broader distribution of linear a-olefins with higher carbon numbers than the homogeneous one (see Table 2).

The IR spectra of the supported catalysts did not show the absorption bands at 3560 and 1260 cm-'which are characteristic of the v(OH) absorption. However, the IR spectra of both catalysts showed all the absorption bands characterizing the Ni-chelate complex. These data. confirm that the Ni complex I reacts with the surface alkyls and hydrides of titanium according to reaction (5). Again, the (O-Ni-P) partial structure remains unaltered during the heterogenization process. The selectivity and activity of these catalysts in ethylene oligomerization are comparable to those when using homogeneous Ni complex I (Table 1). Moreover, an increase in the activity and the selectivity can be achieved by raising the oligomerization temperature from 343 to 363 K. Catalyst Ni complex I/MgH2 In accordance with the results discussed in the first two parts of the present article, it is evident that supports with metal alkyl or metal hydride ligands can be used for the synthesis of supported Ni complexes which are active in protolysis reactions. Consequently, reaction of the Ni complex I with the MgH2 support was carried out. The results indicated that hydrogen was evolved with a H2/Ni molar ratio of 0.94. It is proposed that the Ni complex I reacts with the MgH2 support as follows: 0 + 1 / \\ (6) gnH2n-I H 'D.

According to Gruber [7) these absorption bands characterized the (P, O) chelate ligand and the Ni complex I. The catalytic properties of the supported Ni complex are very interesting. At 70-85 C the catalyst produces a-olefins in ethylene oligomerization with a selectivity of 85-90g'o. In this case 1-butene .is the main product (80-85O) in a mixture of olefins. At higher temperature (> 90 C) polymer and oligomer were obtained with a ratio of 50:1. However it was observed that the distribution of a-olefins changed at higher temperatures; that is, only 15% of 1-butene was present, whereas the content of higher a-olefins increased. It is possible that the observed reduction in 1-butene percentage is due to an ethylene/ 1-butene copolymerization reaction. For all the supported Ni catalysts in Table 1 except for catalyst 5, the distribution of linear a-olefins was similar (see Fig. 1), and these supported catalysts give a broader distribution of linear olefins than the homogeneous one. It is possible that the supported catalysts contain some different type of Ni active centers. The distribution of linear a-olefins for catalyst 5 and homogeneous Ni complexes is similar. We assume that the catalyst 5 has a more uniform composition of active centers in comparison to the other supported Ni catalysts.

Klabunde et al. [8] have shown that some Ni chelate complexes for ethylene oligomerization become active catalysts for ethylene polymerization when the phosphine ligand is removed from the coordination sphere of the Ni complex. Probably, as in our case high temperatures (90-100 C) were employed, the phosphine ligands on the supported Ni centers were removed in solution, and thus the supported Ni centers responsible for oligomerization were transformed to supported Ni centers responsible for polymerization.
