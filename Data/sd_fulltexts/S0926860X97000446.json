With increasing reduction temperature (300-450), the extent of reduction increased. This increase was not, however, accompanied with increased chemisorption capacity. Namely, the hydrogen chemisorption was highest at a reduction temperature of approx. 300. Also, the carbon monoxide adsorption was almost constant at 200-400, and decreased drastically thereafter. Thus, the results suggest that cobalt agglomerated at temperatures above 400. The activity in toluene hydrogenation correlated well with the hydrogen uptake for reduction temperatures of above 300. Also, the CO hydrogenation activity of the catalyst decreased with increasing temperature of reduction (40(O50) due to the decrease in the number of active sites. Keywords: Cobalt; Reduction 1. Introduction Cobalt catalysts have been widely applied industrially in hydrogenation and hydrotreating processes. One of the most prevalent uses of cobalt catalysts has been in the production of fuels and chemicals via the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [1]. Recently, a promoted Co/SiO2 catalyst was developed for the Shell Middle Distillate Synthesis process now operating in Malaysia [2]. In contrast the literature on reactions such as hydrogenation of aromatics on cobalt catalysts is sparse [3-6]. Nevertheless, the activity of Co/SiO2 in benzene hydrogenation has been reported to be higher than that of Ni/SiO2 [3], and cobalt carbonyl-based catalysts have also merited attention in toluene hydrogenation [5]. * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Niemelii et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 319-334 The properties of the conventional Co/Sit2 catalysts are greatly influenced by metal loading, dispersion and method of preparation [7,8]. The Co/Sit2 catalysts prepared by impregnation have exhibited higher extents of reduction, higher hydrogen uptakes and higher specific activities in CO hydrogenation than their precipitated counterparts [7,8]. With fixed preparation (impregnation from aqu- eous solution) and constant metal loading, the catalyst performance is particularly affected by the extent of reduction and dispersion of the metallic cobalt species. Supported cobalt catalysts have been widely studied in terms of dispersion and extent of reduction [1,7-17]. In the case of Co/A1203 [18], the hydrogen uptakes have increased linearly, and the extents of reduction have increased non-linearly with increasing reduction temperature, whereas dispersion has passed through a maximum at approx. 350 [12,18]. The decrease in metal dispersion at tem- peratures above 350 may be related to agglomeration or to the formation of cobalt aluminates [ 11 ]. On the other hand, dispersion also depends on the duration of the reduction treatment; the dispersion of Co/A1203 has increased with increasing extent of reduction when the catalysts have been reduced at relatively low temperatures, 325 or 3750C, for different periods of time [11]. Some reports also pertain to the optimal pretreatment of Co/Sit2 [7,8,10,14,17]. Although the publications on Co/Sit2 with constant metal loading of 3-5 wt% are numerous [7,8,10,14,19], the systematic studies on the effect of reduction tem- perature or duration of reduction on the characteristics of the catalyst are scarce. Castner et al. [14] have reported that the first step of the reduction, CO304--+CoO, occurred near 300, and the second step, CoO--~Co, proceeded at a temperature correlated with the ease of water removal. The data obtained by different techniques did not, however, necessarily agree on the time and temperature needed for complete reduction [14]. Thus, high temperature treatments (>450) have appeared necessary for complete reduction [10,14], but questions about the detailed relation between the reduction temperature and duration of reduction have remained unanswered for Co/Sit2. In the light of the previous results [ 1,15,16,18] it is apparent that the performance of the Co/Sit2 catalysts in hydrogenation is closely related to the pretreatment of the catalyst, i.e. to the extent of reduction and dispersion. Thus, the objective of the present study was to determine effect of reductive pretreatment on the character- istics and activity of the Co/Sit2 using CO hydrogenation and toluene hydro- genation as test reactions. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The catalyst support used was Grace 432 silica, which was pretreated with a volumetric 1 : 1 mixture of ethanol and water. This was in order to equalize the M.K. Niemelii et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 319-334 321 OH--group distribution of the carrier before impregnation with an aqueous solution of cobalt nitrate. A detailed description of the preparation of the 4.6 wt% Co/SiO2 catalyst is given in our previous publication [20]. The catalyst was calcined by elevating the temperature with 3/min to either 300 or 500 under air flow. The temperature was kept at the setpoint value for 12 h, and thereafter cooled to room temperature under nitrogen flow. 2.2. XPS The prereduced catalysts samples were analysed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) to estimate the extent of cobalt reduction. The prereduction was carried out by elevating the temperature with 3/min to 300, 350, 400 or 450 under hydrogen flow. The temperature was kept at the setpoint value for 7 h, and thereafter the catalyst was cooled to room temperature under nitrogen flow. The reduced catalyst samples were supported on aluminium sample holders with a thin film of low vapour pressure resin in a glove box, and transferred under nitrogen atmosphere to XPS analysis. The XPS apparatus was a Perkin-Elmer model 3057 PC-controlled ESCA labsystem, with a dual-anode X-ray source operating under UHV (Ultra High Vacuum). A1Ka X-rays and a hemispherical analyser operating at a constant pass energy of 50 eV were used. The Si2p binding energy of 103.7 eV was used as an energy reference to account for the charging of the insulating SiO2 samples [21]. The ratio of the peak area of the metallic component (Co to the total intensity of the Co2p3/2 photoelectron peak was used as a measure for the extent of reduction. The amount of CoO was determined by a symmetric Gauss-Lorenzian peak fit [22], in combination with a linear background correc- tion. The linear background subtraction tends to overestimate the higher binding energy side of the Co2p3/2 photoelectron peak. Nevertheless, we used it instead of the frequently used Shirley subtraction [23], because at low Co2p intensities the Shirley algorithm fails to produce the rapidly rising inelastic background resulting in serious deformations in the peak shapes. Furthermore, comparisons to the Tougaard method [24] have shown that the linear algorithm approximates the correct slope under the Co2p3/2 peak better than Shirley [25]. Tougaard method cannot, however, be used on this data set, because of the too narrow energy interval recorded. The method used provides only a lower limit estimate for the extent of reduction e.g. since only the outermost cobalt layers are analysed by XPS, and because the energy losses cannot be resolved from the real chemical shifts. In addition, the A1Koz radiation produces CoLMM Auger interference in the Co2p3/2 spectral region by slightly enhancing the low binding energy side of the metallic peak [26]. This effect is small compared to the errors caused by e.g. the fitting procedure of the relatively weak Co2p signal. In fact, the same CoCo2p3/2 ratios were obtained both with MgKc~ radiation and with A1Kct radiation within an error of 5% [27]. It is 322 M.K. Niemelii et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 319--334 also noteworthy that in the case of AIK~ the CoLMM did not interfere with the O 1 s signal. 2.3. Chemisorption The chemisorption measurements were carried out by a static hydrogen chemisorption equipment, an Omnisorp 100CX. The procedure used for chemi- sorption follows the methods described in the literature [28,29]. For the measurement, a calcined catalyst sample of approx. 500 mg was placed in a glass U-tube sample holder. The sample was heated (10/min) to 150 under vacuum, and purged with helium at 150 for 30 min. Thereafter, the temperature of the sample was elevated (10/min) to the reduction temperature, 200, 300, 400 or 500, and the catalyst was reduced in situ under hydrogen flow for a period of 2-20 h. After reduction, the sample was evacuated for 60 min at the temperature of reduction, and cooled to the measurement temperature, 30-200, under vacuum (approx. 1.3x 10-4 Pa). The lower limit of 30 represents the room temperature measurement, because 25 could not be reached due to heat transfer within the equipment. The isotherm for the total adsorption of hydrogen was measured (2.9 x 104 Pa), and the amount adsorbed was determined from the linear portion of the isotherm by extrapolation to zero pressure. Thereafter, the sample was evacuated for 40 min, i.e. the reversibly adsorbed hydrogen was removed, and the isotherm for the reversible adsorption was determined (2.9 x 104 Pa). The amount of strongly adsorbed hydrogen representing irreversible chemisorption was determined by subtracting the isotherm of reversible adsorption from the isotherm of total adsorption. The dispersions were calculated from the total chemisorption of hydrogen according to recommenda- tions [28], and because the amount of irreversible uptake of hydrogen was sensitive to both the duration of evacuation and the amount of the sample. The estimate for the particle size was calculated assuming spherical geometry of uniform size. The values obtained for dispersion and particle size were corrected with the extent of reduction. 2.4. Activity Toluene hydrogenation studies were carried out in a down flow fixed-bed, tubular quartz glass microreactor, at atmospheric pressure with a toluene to hydrogen ratio of 1-7. The molar flow was 0.8 mol/h, and the amount of catalyst used was 0.1 g. The reaction temperature was 175. The analysis was performed by an on-line FT-IR gas analyser described in more detail in a previous publication [30]. The multicomponent analysis method of Saarinen and Kauppinen [31 ] was utilized in the quantitative analysis of the IR-spectra. Data was collected con- tinuously throughout the reaction, and the activities reported herein refer to a reaction time of 1 h. M.K.

Chemisorption The effect of the duration of reduction on the hydrogen chemisorption at 30 was determined for the Co/SiO2 catalyst calcined at 300 and reduced in situ at 400, i.e. at the pretreatment temperatures previously used [20,25,32]. The results shown in Fig. 1 indicate that the uptake of hydrogen increased to a maximum at approx. 5-7 h of reduction time, and a prolonged reduction time produced no further benefit. Nevertheless, Reuel and Bartholomew [7] have used a much longer and a more complicated reduction treatment for Co/SiO2 than ours was. They [7] chose a low rate of heating (less than 5/min) combined with pauses at 100 and 200, i.e. at temperatures at which water vapourises and the nitrate precursor decomposes, together with the final 16 h hold at 400. Their procedure with the long reduction time of 16 h was, however, based on experience with the Ni/A1203 system [7], and thus not necessarily the best available for Co/SiO2. In contrast to our results, Moon and Yoon [11] have also reported that the hydrogen uptake increased with increasing time of reduction (0.25-36 h) at 375 in case of Co/ 18 16 - 14 o ~ 12 .-1 = 8 ~ 6 o L 4 ii- i/ O I I I I 2 4 6 8 I I I I I I 10 12 14 16 18 20 Reduction time, h 22 -~- Total chemisorption v Irreversible chemisorption ] Fig. 1.

The Co/A1203 catalyst is more difficult to reduce than Co/SiO2 [8,33], and therefore the longer duration of reduction at low reduction temperatures might be of benefit to it. At high temperatures, however, very long reduction times probably enhance the formation of cobalt-alumina compounds resistant to reduction [9,11 ]. The total uptakes of hydrogen were also determined as a function measurement temperature for catalysts calcined at 300 and reduced in situ at 300, 400 or 500 for 7 h, see Fig. 2. The results show that the total uptake of hydrogen on Co/ SiO2 increased when the temperature was increased from 30 to 200, i.e. the adsorption of hydrogen is an activated process as reported previously [7,13]. Furthermore, the relative increase in adsorption increased with increasing reduc- tion temperature, i.e. the interaction of cobalt with the silica support increased with increasing reduction temperature [7]. The ratio of maximum to room temperature uptake, defined as the activation factor [7], was 1.1, 1.25 and 1.4 for catalyst samples reduced at 300, 400 and 500, respectively. The activation factors are in good agreement with the values (1.0-1.3) reported by Reuel and Bartho- lomew [7] for 3-10 wt% Co/SiO2 catalysts reduced at 400. Since the activation factors were fairly low, and the amounts of uptakes were clearly distinguishable for M.K.

The effect of reduction temperature on the hydrogen uptake at 30 for Co/SiO/. 550 the catalysts reduced at different temperatures, the measurement at 30 provided an adequate basis for further comparative work. Accordingly, to elucidate the effect of calcination, the amount of hydrogen chemisorption at 30 was determined for catalysts calcined at 300 or 500, and reduced in situ at 300, 400 or 500 for 7 h. The results depicted in Fig. 3 show that the hydrogen uptake was lower after high temperature calcination - an implication of decreased extent of reduction or increased particle size. Our result is not contradictory to the findings of Rosynek and Polanski [ 19], although they have obtained higher extents of reduction for Co/SiO2 calcined at 500 than in the absence of calcination. Namely, their results [ 19] merely indicate that calcination is beneficial without specifying the best calcination temperature in terms of the extent of reduction. In support of our view, Chin and Hercules [9] have reported that an increase in calcination temperature at a given metal loading lowered the percent of reduction for Co/A1203. The high temperature calcination produced a surface spinel, identical to cobalt aluminate, and resistant to reduction [9]. The formation of such chemically inert surface structures is not as dominant on Co/ SiO2 as it is on C0/A1203, but its formation may not be totally excluded [17,19]. However, Chin and Hercules [9] have also stated that the Co/A1203 catalysts calcined at 600 exhibited larger crystallites than the ones calcined at 400. Since the interaction of cobalt with silica is lower than with alumina [7,8,33], it is 326 M.K. Niemelii et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 319-334 very likely that high temperature calcination induces sintering. Therefore, the decrease in hydrogen uptake after high temperature calcination is most likely due to the formation of minor amount cobalt silicate surface species together with sintering - the effect of latter being more profound. The results shown in Fig. 3 also indicate that the hydrogen uptake of our Co/ SiO2 catalysts passed through a maximum at approx. 300, although for Co/ A1203 the hydrogen uptake has increased with increasing reduction temperature [ 11,16,18]. This distinct behaviour might be due to the different characteristics of the supports; the reducibility of cobalt particles is better on silica than on alumina [7,8,33], and therefore the hydrogen uptake is likely to reach a maximum at a lower temperature. Also, the particles could agglomerate at lower reduction temperatures on Co/SiO2 than on Co/A1203 as already discussed in conjunction with high temperature calcination. In accordance, Coulter and Sault [17] have reported that for 16-19 wt% Co/SiO2 an increase in the reduction temperature from 300 to 400 probably induced sintering, and hence the reason for decrease in hydrogen uptake at temperatures above 300 was most likely due to agglomeration. The amount of carbon monoxide chemisorption was also determined at 30 for the catalysts calcined at 3000C and reduced at 200, 300, 400 or 500. The results depicted in Fig. 4 indicate that the total amount of chemisorbed CO remained constant after reduction at 200-400, whereas the amount dropped drastically after reduction at 500. This sudden drop in the adsorption capacity is 25 1.6 20 o [[ 15 e~ ~, 10 5 J- r't J 0 -.. . / \\ f \\ '0 0 I b I I I I 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 1.4 1.2 o 1.0 0.8 \"-\" 0.6 0.4 550 Reduction temperature, Total chemisorpti-on ~ Irreversible ehemisorption ~L -o- (CO/H) ratio ....

Niemelii et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 319-334 327 in agreement with the decreased chemisorption of hydrogen above 350, and supports the speculations regarding the agglomeration of the cobalt species on the support. The CO chemisorption results may also be expressed as the (CO/I\"I)total ratio as shown in Fig. 4. The ratio increased towards the reduction temperature of 500, and previously a high adsorption stoichiometry of CO has been attributed either to variations in the relative amounts of bridged, linear and subcarbonyl species or to a more intimate electronic interaction between the small metal crystallites and the support [7]. In our case the latter explanation appears more likely, and therefore the increase in the (CO]H)total ratio provides further support for the more intimate interaction between the metal crystallite and the support with increasing temperature of reduction. Thus, high temperature pretreatments appear to induce sintering as well as the possible formation of cobalt silicate surface species. 3.2. Extent of reduction The extent of reduction was determined by surface sensitive XPS - a method not very accurate for catalysts containing cobalt [25,26]. In order to make our XPS analysis more quantitative, a calibration line based on independent reduction estimates was constructed. A polycrystalline cobalt foil sample was used as a reference for 100% extent of reduction, and the spectrum obtained for the calcined catalyst (no reduction) [20] offered a reference point for 0% extent of reduction. The intermediate values were obtained by plotting the reduction estimates from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for three Co/SiO2 samples as a function of the CoCo2p3/2 ratios, which were also available [20] after re-analysis of the XP- spectra with linear background correction algorithm. According to this calibration, the CoCo2p3/2 ratio multiplied by a factor of (2.04-0.1) gives a correct estimate for the extent of reduction. The XP-spectra were measured for the catalysts calcined at 300, and reduced at 300 or 350. The previously measured [20,25] XP-spectra were re-analysed for the catalyst calcined at 300 and reduced at 400 [20,25] or 450 [20], see Fig. 5.

The results indicate that the estimate for the extent of reduction for the Co/Sit2 catalyst increased with increasing reduction temperature (300-400), as observed also for Co/A1203 of carbonyl origin [12,18]. At 450, however, the extent of reduction was slightly lower than at 400. The reason for this decrease may well be the increasing interaction of cobalt with the silica surface as discussed in Section 3.1. However, the decrease may also be due to the sensitivity of the XP-spectra to the particle size as has been reported in conjunction with Co/A1203 [34-36] as well as in more general terms [37,38]. In fact, this is an important aspect for the analysis of the XPS results and merits a more detailed discussion. As already described in conjunction with chemisorption, the particle size was increased by increasing the temperature of the catalyst pretreatment. On the other hand, the increasing particle size lowers the Co2p peak intensity due to the inelastic energy losses. Therefore, the measured CoO intensities after high temperature treatments may be too low with respect to the true metal loading. Consequently, the effect of the particle size was approximated from the present data by comparing the Co2p3/2 intensities with the XPS signal of the silica support according to the simple procedure proposed by Le6n [38]. The analysis is very sensitive to the choice of the sensitivity factors for the peaks, and reliable numerical estimates for the absolute particle sizes could not be obtained from the data. The comparison showed, however, that the average particle size was not increased by more than a factor of 1.3 as the reduction temperature was increased from 350 to 400. Thus, the estimated values might be slightly too low for catalysts sintered during the pretreatment, and therefore the decrease in the extent of reduction with increasing reduction temperature (400-450) provides further evidence for sintering at high temperatures. It is also noteworthy that the values determined were in good agreement with the 75% extent of reduction obtained by Reuel and Bartholomew [7,8] for 3 wt% Co/Sit2 at 400, although the method of determination was different: XPS and oxygen titration [7,8]. Nevertheless, Coulter and Sault [17] have obtained an extent of reduction as high as 89% for 15.8 wt% Co/SiO2. Very highly or fully reduced cobalt catalysts are, however, very difficult to produce, because the extent of reduction may be decreased due to migration of silica (encapsulation of cobalt) [14], or due to the formation of a cobalt silicate surface species resistant to reduction [17,19]. Castner et al. [14] have reported that migration of silica most likely took place in the presence of water, and stated that migration happens at temperatures above 250 for a wide range of silica- containing materials. Since the migration is enhanced in the presence of water, it is more profound for materials with very small pores and limited transfer of water out of the pores during reduction. However, only approx. 5% of the pores of our 330 M.K. Niemelii et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 319-334 silica matrix were as small as 3-4 nm in radius [25] and the reduction was carried out under flowing hydrogen. Therefore, the migration of silica should not be substantial on our catalyst samples. On the other hand, the formation of non-reducible cobalt silicates has been observed in conjunction with calcination and high dispersion, as well as hydro- thermal treatment [17,19,39,40]. For example, Rosynek and Polanski [19] observed cobalt silicate formation in the absence of calcination, and Coulter and Sault [17] have provided evidence for the formation of cobalt silicates during catalyst preparation as a result of cobalt nitrate decomposition under vacuum conditions. In the light of their detailed description [ 17], it is possible that a minor amount of cobalt silicates might have been formed during the vacuum drying step of our catalyst preparation. Furthermore, the chemisorption results implied that the high temperature pretreatment facilitated more intimate interaction between the cobalt particles and the silica support providing indirect evidence for the formation of cobalt silicates. Thus, it appears likely that some cobalt silicates may have been formed on our Co/SiO2 catalysts, although their amounts remained too low to be detected from the XPS Si2p signal. The estimates derived for the extents of reduction were utilized in the calculation of dispersions and particle sizes from the chemisorption data, see Table 1. The values obtained for dispersion were lower than [7,41] or comparable to [29] the reported values. Thus, the dispersion appeared to decrease with increasing reduction temperature for Co/SiO2, whereas in the case of Co/A1203, the metal dispersion passed through a maximum at approx. 350 [12,18]. The calculated trend of dispersion is, however, only a natural outcome of the previously discussed values for hydrogen uptake and extent of reduction. 3.3. Activity 3.3.1. CO hydrogenation The activity of the Co]SiO2 catalysts in CO hydrogenation has been determined at 235-290 and 5 bar, after calcination at 300 and in situ reduction at 400 or 450 [20,32]. The increase in reduction temperature from 400 to 450 resulted in decreased activity for Co/SiO2, see Fig. 6, without any significant effects on the probability of chain growth or product distribution as reported in our previous publication [32]. The decrease in activity is consistent with the decreasing chemisorption capacity of hydrogen and CO chemisorption at temperatures above 400, and is probably due to agglomeration of the active metallic cobalt sites, see also Table 1. In contradiction to our results, Moon and Yoon [11] have obtained a higher extent of reduction (32.3-69.8%) and higher conversions (0.5-1.6%) by increasing the reduction temperature of Co/A1203 (325-525). We presume that the lower reducibility of the Co/A1203 catalyst compared to that of Co/SiO2 results in a shift of the optimal reduction temperature to a higher temperature. Therefore, the M.K.

Johnson et al. [16] have also noticed trends of increasing activity (expressed as carbon monoxide turnover frequency) with increasing percentage of reduction for the Co/A1203 catalyst of carbonyl origin, although the specific activity of the well-reduced cobalt catalysts was independent of dispersion. However, the enhancement obtained in conversions by increasing the reduction temperature is limited, since above 400 inactive cobalt aluminates may be formed [ 11 ]. 3.3.2. Toluene hydrogenation The activity of the Co/SiOz calcined at 300 and reduced in situ at 200, 300, 400, and 500 was also determined. The results shown in Fig. 7 indicate that the activity of the catalyst in toluene hydrogenation decreased with increasing reduction temperature, and was not directly related to the hydrogen uptake of the catalyst (measured at 30). To be more precise, the decrease in hydrogen uptake at reduction temperatures below 300 did not result in a drop in the hydrogenation activity. However, for reduction temperatures of 300-500, the results obtained with hydrogen chemisorption agreed well with the activity in toluene hydrogenation, i.e. the higher the uptake the higher the activity. Thus, the decrease in activity (and hydrogen uptake) at reduction temperatures above 300 332 M.K.

The effect of reduction temperature on the activity of Co/SiO2 in toluene hydrogenation at 175 at atmospheric pressure, 0.1 g of catalyst. may be largely due to agglomeration. Nevertheless, Jabl6nski et al. [6] have suggested for Co/SiO2 that the decrease in benzene hydrogenation activity with increasing reduction temperature (450-900) resulted from formation of a Co-Si solid solution. The formation of such Co-Si solid solutions on our catalyst samples appears, however, unlikely, since the reduction temperature range we used remained significantly lower than that of Jabl6nski et al. [6] 4. Summary and conclusions The pretreatment conditions for nitrate based Co/SiO2 were discussed in terms of the characteristics and activity of the catalysts. The results indicated that the catalyst calcined at 300 exhibited higher hydrogen uptake than the one calcined at 500, i.e. low temperature calcination appeared more beneficial, and was chosen as a standard procedure prior to reduction. The extent of reduction increased with increasing reduction temperature, and a duration of 5-7 h was sufficient for the maximum effect. The values obtained for the extent of reduction by XPS were 60-85%, and most likely a very small amount of non-reducible cobalt silicates was formed during pretreatment at high temperatures. In terms of M.K. Niemelii et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 319-334 333 reduction temperature, the hydrogen uptakes passed through a maximum at 300, and CO uptakes at 400, respectively. Consequently, the dispersion of metallic cobalt decreased with increasing reduction temperature. In respect to the activity of the catalyst in the hydrogenation of toluene, a reduction temperature of 300 appeared most beneficial, because the hydrogen uptake and activity were interrelated. In CO hydrogenation, a reduction tempera- ture of 400 was better than 450 in terms of activity: the fairly high extent of reduction (84%) was combined with moderate hydrogen uptake and maximum CO uptake.

The activity and characteristics of the nitrate derived Co SiO2 were determined in relation to reductive pretreatment. With increasing reduction temperature (300–450°C), the extent of reduction increased. This increase was not, however, accompanied with increased chemisorption capacity. Namely, the hydrogen chemisorption was highest at a reduction temperature of approx. 300°C. Also, the carbon monoxide adsorption was almost constant at 200–400°C, and decreased drastically thereafter. Thus, the results suggest that cobalt agglomerated at temperatures above 400°C. The activity in toluene hydrogenation correlated well with the hydrogen uptake for reduction temperatures of above 300°C. Also, the CO hydrogenation activity of the catalyst decreased with increasing temperature of reduction (400–450°C) due to the decrease in the number of active sites.
