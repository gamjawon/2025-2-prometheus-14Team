Two preparation methods, ion exchange and impregnation, using different nickel precursors were tested. Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (TPDA), thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), electronic microscopy (SEM, TEM) and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AA) techniques were used to characterize the catalysts. The n-decane hydroisomerization was selected as a test reaction to determine the catalyst activity. These experiments were carried out in a basket type reactor, using a catalyst ground with sodium montmorillonite. The method of nickel incorporation was found to be an important indicator for the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, having a significant influence not only on its hydrogenating properties but also on its acidity. The nickel incorporation technique was mainly affecting the nickel dispersion, while it was affecting both functions, metallic and acid, when the precursor was modified.

The production of lube oil base stocks is one of the major functions of many petroleum refineries. These stocks are used for the formulation of lubricating oils by blending with additives and other base stocks.

PH S0926-860X(96)00146-9 426 M.D. Romero et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 425-441 bases has undergone many changes and comprises several processes designed to improve its properties to be used as lubricating oils: viscosity, viscosity index, pour point, color and thermal and oxidative stability. The processes involved in its preparation, such as deasphalting, refining, dewaxing and hydrofinishing, remove or transform the initial components of the raw material into the desired compounds. In this way, the paraffin content of the base is an important factor, which largely determines the cold-temperature and viscosity oil properties. The initial fractions still contain waxes and some processes like deasphalting and refining increase even more the n-paraffin content, which has to be partially removed to obtain the desired low-temperature properties of the lubricating oils. The wax removal is conventionally performed by two methods: solvent and catalytic dewaxing. These are different processes, but basically the first one consists of the elimination of the waxes by extraction with selective solvents, while the catalytic process involves its conversion by shape-selective hydrocracking with a zeolite-based catalyst to lower the amount of molecular weight products which are later removed from the lube by normal distillation [1-3]. There are important differences between both processes and many studies have revealed that catalytic dewaxing has lower operating costs and environmental load than the solvent process, although it usually gives less yield and worse properties of the dewaxed lube [3-5]. Recently, other catalytic dewaxing processes, which eliminate the paraffins through selective isomerization of n-paraffins to branched isoparaffins, have become more attractive [6-9]. These do not only decrease the lube yield loss, due to the removal of n-paraffins by conventional solvent or cracking process, but also improve the lube quality since branched isoparaffins give better cold temperature properties and viscosity index to the oil. Due to the nature of the reactions concerned in these processes, isomerization and cracking of n-paraffins, bifunctional catalysts with both an hydrogenationdehydrogenation and an acid function are needed [ 10]. The acidic centers perform the isomerization and cracking reactions through classical or non classical ion carbenium chemistry [11,12], while the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation centers generate alkenes from the paraffins, hydrogenate the unsaturated products; it has also been suggested that they promote the recombination and desorption of hydrogen, which was abstracted before from the paraffin molecule [13-15]. Typical examples of these types of catalysts are noble and Group VIII metals (Pt, Pd, Ni, Mo) supported by zeolites and other acidic supports [16-20]. The acid and metal site density and strength distribution are both important and their proper balance is critical in determining the reactivity and selectivity of these catalysts [21-24]. The pore opening of the zeolite has also a major effect on the selectivity because when it is small enough it can prevent the larger isoparaffins from reacting at the acidic sites inside the pore. Several studies have been made on the effects of zeolite pore size and channel geometry on hydroisomerization and the hydrocracking reaction mechanism of M.D. Romero et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 425-441 427 these dual functional catalysts [25-34]. Thus, a catalyst for the selective hydroisomerization of n-paraffins should be selective for isomerization versus cracking and for reacting only with normal paraffins, which have an effective 0 critical diameter of ca. 5 A, leaving the bulkier nonlinear paraffins unreacted. The first is mainly determined by the proper balance of acidic and hydrogenation activity, while the second comes from the size of the micropore channels of the zeolite used. In this mean, medium size pore zeolites like ZSM-5 and SAPO-11 are widely used for the industrial dewaxing processes [10,21,35,36]. These zeolites have the additional advantage that they exhibit not only shape selectivity toward the reactionant but also toward the transition state [37,38] and thus lower branched products are obtained since the formation of bulk molecules inside the pores is extremely hindered. Such highly branched products are beneficial to improve the gasoline octane, but it is damaging for tubes because it reduces the viscosity index of the final oils [39]. Moreover, extensive branching may give higher pour points than a single branch placed near the center of the molecule [40]. Therefore, the reduction of the pour point with minimum branching preserves the high quality of the tube base when the medium pore zeolites are used. Metal catalysts are commonly used in the form of well-dispersed phases as small crystallites on high surface area supports and its activity entirely depends on the extent and state of the active surface. This is mainly determined by the metal dispersion, degree of reduction and metal-support interaction [22,41-43]. The technique of metal incorporation as well as the following steps normally performed in the catalyst preparation (drying, calcination and reduction), strongly influence the final distribution, particle size and properties of the active metal [23,24,44-46]. Thus, the technique determines not only the initial dispersion but also the stability during the following catalyst calcination and reduction steps [45,47,48]. This point is remarkably significant because the metal mobility and agglomeration during the heat treatment modify the state of the metal and consequently its catalytic properties. Thereby, when the ion exchange technique is used to incorporate the metal on the catalyst, highly initial metallic dispersion is acquired, determined by the zeolite center distribution with a firm metal-support interaction. On the other hand, the metal precursor mainly causes the initial dispersion and the metal-support interaction due to size restrictions of the pores of the zeolite, the acid-basic character and the decomposition ability to generate a dispersed metal phase. Moreover, the presence of a metal on these catalysts may modify the Brdnsted centers of the zeolite [49] as well as the metal state and may be strongly modified by the influence of the support [23,50]. In this paper the influence of the metal incorporation method, technique and metal precursor on the catalytic properties of a bifunctional catalyst based on nickel and ZSM-5 were examined by studying the hydroisomerization of n-decane. The ZSM-5 zeolite was selected as the acid factor because it exhibits the desired molecular shape selectivity while nickel was chosen for the hydro- 428 M.D. Romero et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 425-441 genation-dehydrogenation reaction in spite of its weaker activity as compared with noble metals (Pt, Pd), because of its wide use in industrial processes; some recent studies have revealed that a nearly ideal hydroconversion catalyst can be obtained by modifying the preparation conditions [22-24]. Two different nickel incorporation techniques, ion exchange and impregnation, each one with two precursors, nickel(II) aqueous and nickel(II) triethylenediamine complex ions in ion exchange and nickel(II) nitrate and nickel(II) acetylacetonate in impregnation, were used. The catalysts were mainly characterized by thermogravimetric analyses, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia, temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen and electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction and atomic absorption spectroscopy measurements were also carried out. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The bifunctional catalyst used in this work consists of a matrix of HZSM-5 zeolite, as acid function, nickel, as metallic function, and sodium montmorillonite, as binder. The zeolite was synthesized in sodium form by a procedure developed in our laboratory [51], with an atomic ratio Si/Al = 30, crystallinity = 100% and 8 wm medium particle size. Commercial montmorillonite, Gador Gel, was supplied by Minas de Gador Co (Almeria, Spain). Several precursors were used to incorporate the nickel on the catalyst, as will be described later. The preparation method basically consists of three steps: agglomeration of ZSM-5 zeolite, incorporation of functions (acid and metallic) and activation of the metallic function. The NaZSM-5 was bound with sodium montmorillonite (35/65 weight) by preparing a homogeneous aqueous suspension of both materials in continuous agitation and heating for 2 h. Then the suspension was filtered, and the solid air dried at 120 overnight. After that, it was ground and sieved obtaining particles with an average particle size of 0.75 mm. Finally, it was air calcined at 550 for 12 h. The acid form of the zeolite was acquired by exchanging the Na+ with 35 ml/g of HCl 0.6 M in agitation for 2 h, at room temperature. Nickel incorporation was carried out by using two different techniques. (i) Ion exchange: the zeolite was added to an aqueous nickel salt solution of a known concentration maintaining in agitation for 3 h at 25. After that, the suspension was filtered and thoroughly washed with deionized water to remove completely the occluded salt and then the solid was air dried at 120 for 4 h. Two cationic complexes of nickel were used: hexaquonickel(II), [Ni(H20)6]2+, obtained by solution of hexahydrated nickel (II) nitrate, (N03)2Ni 6H20, of a known concentration; and nickel(II)triethylenediamine, [Ni(CZH,N2)3]2+, ob- M.D. Romero et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 425-441 429 tained from an initial solution of hexahydrated nickel(II) nitrate by adding ethylenediamine in excess. The final concentrations of both complexes were measured by UV-VIS spectrophotometry. (ii) Impregnation: the sample was placed into a glass vessel and maintained in vacuum at room temperature for 4 h to remove the water and other compounds adsorbed on the zeolite. A known volume of a nickel precursor solution, the minimum amount to wet the solid, was then dropped over the zeolite. Then the solvent was removed by evaporation under vacuum. The nickel content added to the catalyst was controlled by the concentration of the impregnating solution. Hexahydrated nickel(II) nitrate and nickel(II) acetylacetonate were used as precursors, with water and carbon tetrachloride as solvents, respectively. After the nickel incorporation the catalysts were air calcined for 4 h at 400 for the inorganic precursors and at 550 for the organic ones. Finally, the catalyst was activated by gradual heating to 400, over a 1 h period, under an hydrogen flow of 1.2 Nm3/(h kg) at a pressure of 1013 kPa, and was k 400 for 2 h. 2.2. Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to measure the crystallinity of the synthesized zeolites. The diffractograms were collected with a Siemens Kristalloflex D-500 diffractometer having a CuKa radiation and a Ni filter. Crystallinit\" was determined from the peak high at 2 = 23using a 100% crystalline : ~,: pattern as reference. In order to find out the total quantity of nickel incorporated to the catalyst ar.~ the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite, atomic absorption measurements (AA) were mate using a Thermo Jarrel ASH Corporation Smith Hiefjje/ 11 spectrophotometer with simple beam and Smith Hiefjje background correction. The samples we- . previously broken up by hydrofluoric acid and diluted to values in the range -f the measurements. Morphology and location of metallic species on the surface of the catalysts were revealed by scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy. The SEM measurements were carried out using a JEOL JSM-6400 microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX). The images were taken with an emission current = 100 ~LA by a wolframium filament and an accelerator voltage = 20 kV. The pretreatment of the samples consisted of coating with an evaporated Au film in a Balzers SCDO04 Sputter Coater metallizator to increase the catalyst electric conductivity. The TEM images of the samples were taken with a JEOL JEM-2000 FX microscope equipped with an EDX analyzer too. The catalysts were previously ground and suspended in acetone by an ultrasonic bath. Then they were placed in a Cu cellulose coated grille. The thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were made with a system that hasi- 430 M.D. Romero et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 425-441 cally consisted of an C.I. Electronics Limited MK2 microgravimetric analyzer, a Severn Science Lt. TF383/2 three zones heating furnace, three temperature controllers, a PC computer equipped with an I/O board and data acquisition software and three 5850TR Brooks Instruments flow-rate controllers. First the catalysts were dehydrated by heating to 120 in a dry-air flow of 0.006 Nm3/h up to read a constant sample weight. Then the desired heating rate was fixed and the temperature and weight of the sample were continuously registered versus time, up to the desired temperature. The derivatives of weight loss were also calculated (DTG). Total acid site density and acid strength distribution of the catalysts were measured by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (TPDA), by using a Micromeritics TPD/TPR 2900 analyzer with an Alltech Hydro-Purge II, Oxy-Trap and hydrocarbon filters, to avoid the presence of oxygen, water and hydrocarbons in the gas streams. The samples were housed in a quartz tubular reactor and pretreated in flowing helium while heating at 15/min to 550, and maintaining them for 30 min at this temperature. After cooling the sample to room temperature, the reduction of the nickel supported on the catalyst was achieved by heating to 500 in a pure hydrogen flow and maintaining for 1 h. After that, previous to stabilization in helium flow, the sample was cooled to 200 and ammonia-saturated by flowing a pure ammonia stream over the sample for 15 min. The catalyst was then allowed to equilibrate in a helium flow for 1 h at 200. Thereafter, the ammonia was desorbed using a linear heating rate of 10/min to 550, recording continuously the temperature and detector signals. The area under the curve was integrated to determine the relative total acidity of the catalysts. In order to obtain the strength distribution, the desorption profiles were fitted using two peaks and the maxima and widths of the peaks were held as constant as possible while fitting each profile. Weak and strong acidities are defined as the areas under the peaks at the lowest and highest temperatures, respectively. The use of these peaks to fit the profiles was not based on any peak assignment to a specific acid site (Brdnsted or Lewis) but, instead, was a convenient method to categorize the acid strength distribution obtained by this method. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were carried out with the same apparatus described for TPDA. After loading, the sample was outgassed by heating to 15/min in argon flowing to 550 and was kept constant at this temperature for 30 min. Next, it was cooled at room temperature and stabilized in an argon/hydrogen (85/15 volumetric ratio) flow for 1 h. The temperature and detector signals were continuously recorded while heating at 10/min to 550. The water formed during the reduction process was retained by a cooling trap placed between the sample and the detector. The total area under the profile was used to obtain the quantity of the reduced nickel. The profile was also fit to several peaks to determine the different reducibilities of the catalysts.

Catalyst activity measurements The hydroisomerization of n-decane was selected as test reaction since it has been widely used [16,24,25,32,40] and even proposed as model to characterize bifunctional catalysts [27]. Experiments of n-decane hydroisomerization were carried out in a discontinuous basket type reactor at 290 for 3 h and under a hydrogen pressure of 5055 kPa. The reactor was a Robinson-Mahoney model (Autoclave Engineers), built-in hastelloy with a total volume of 50 cm3. The temperature was measured and controlled by a thermocouple placed inside the reactor and a temperature controller. The hydrogen was introduced by a Brooks mass flow controller at constant and known flow rate. After the reaction time, the reactor was depressurized by a Veriflo Co. back pressure regulator, obtaining both liquid and gas phases. These were analyzed by a Hewlett-Packard gas chromatography, using a Porapack Q 80/ 100 ASTM column and a TCD detector for the gas phase and a fused silica capillary column and FID detector for the liquid phase. 3. Results and discussion Table 1 summarizes the nickel incorporation method and precursor as well as the nickel content of the catalysts prepared to evaluate the impact that the precursor and incorporation method have on the properties of the bifunctional catalyst. 3.1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, DTG) Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, DTG) of the catalysts was carried out after the nickel incorporation step to settle the possible changes in the nickel state during the calcination. Fig. 1 shows the TGA and DTG curves of the four catalysts. These curves were corrected by subtracting the curve of a catalyst without any nickel content.

The weight loss below 400 of the catalyst prepared by ion exchange with the aqueous complex of nickel (Iex-I) agrees with the loss of the associated water of the complex ion, 1.8%. At low temperature, a small increase in weight of the catalyst without nickel can be found, which is due to a lower water adsorption over the zeolite. Thus, it seems that during the calcination of this catalyst the water of the complexed ion is removed at temperatures below 400 without any change in the nickel distribution, which is strongly fixed to the catalyst by ion exchange. However, the catalyst prepared with the nickel(II)triethylenediamine complex (lex-O) exhibits a greater weight loss than what should correspond with the removal of the ion ligand, 3.0%. This can be explained by taking into account that the solution used to exchange the nickel had an excess of ethylenediamine to totally complex the nickel ions, which has basic properties and therefore is also adsorbed on the catalyst. The DTG curve shows a narrow peak at 250 which could be due to a fast desorption of the weakly fixed ethylenediamine. The other peaks at 440 and 570 might be explained by the desorption with the associated decomposition of the strongly adsorbed ligand at higher temperatures. On the other hand, the weight loss of both catalysts prepared by impregnation agree with the decomposition of the precursor to nickel oxide. The inorganic precursor decomposition (Imp-I) is produced below 400, showing two peaks, while the organic precursor (Imp-O) has a continuous weight loss from 200 to 600 that can be separated in four overlapped peaks. These decomposition processes are usually exothermic and M.D. Romero et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 425-441 433 may produce important modifications in the nickel dispersion by sinterization processes. From the above remarks, the conclusion can be drawn that a temperature of 400 is high enough to stabilize the catalysts prepared with inorganic precursors. However, the organic precursor decompositions require higher temperatures than 400 and thus, 550 was selected to avoid crystallinity loss of the zeolite. 3.2. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) Temperature programmed reduction of the four catalysts (Table 1) was carried out to determine the relative differences in the reducibilities of these catalysts, related with the location and dispersion of nickel after the calcination step. Previously, it was determined that montmorillonite exhibits large hydrogen consumptions at temperatures above 500 due to the reduction of the metals. This consumption is negligible at lower temperatures and can certainly be removed without considerable error by subtracting it from the TPR of the catalysts. Fig. 2 shows the TPR profiles and the Gaussian deconvoluted peaks of the catalysts, and Table 2 lists the maximum temperature and area percent of each deconvoluted peak as well as the total nickel content (measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy) and reduced nickel during the tests (measured from the hydrogen consumption). /~ _\\ Z r t n h i v y v i /i \\ , v 0 10 20 30 40 50 TIME (MIN) Fig. 2.

As it clearly can be seen, the technique of incorporation and precursor of nickel have quite an influence over its reducibility. Since the acid matrix and metallic functions are equal in the four catalysts, the differences found on the reducibilities may be mainly explained by changes in the nickel dispersion as well as in the interaction forces between the nickel and the zeolite [22]. Thus, low reduction temperatures can be related to reduction of big particles, or agglomerates of them, and/or particles that interact weakly with the zeolite. As the temperature increases, the size of the particles decreases or/and the interaction forces with the support are higher. By comparing the TPR profiles for the catalysts prepared with the organic precursors, the nickel reduction occurs at higher temperatures for the ion exchanged one, Iex-O, than the impregnated one, Imp-O, having a main reduction peak (70%) at high temperatures (494). On the other hand, the catalysts prepared with the inorganic precursors show similar reducibilities, although the ion exchanged one (Iex-I) has its main reduction peak (53.4%) at a higher temperature (415) than the impregnated one, Imp-I (66.2%, 380). Therefore, the conclusion can be drawn that the ion exchanged catalysts exhibit smaller and more dispersed nickel particles than the impregnated ones. On the other hand, by looking at the TPR profiles for both impregnated catalysts, the inorganic one (Imp-1) shows wide and overlapping peaks, while the organic one (Imp-O) exhibits narrow and more detached peaks. A similar response is found for the ion exchanged catalysts. This means that the nickel precursor determines noticeably the reducibility of the nickel, by using both techniques. The catalyst prepared by ion exchange with the aqueous complex (Iex-I) is easier reduced than the one prepared with ethylenediamine (Iex-O), showing also a wider particle size distribution, whereas the nickel is more dispersed and has a smaller particle size distribution in the latter. On the other hand, the catalyst prepared with the inorganic precursor by impregnation (Imp-1) exhibits also a wider nickel particle size distribution than Imp-O. Finally, it has to be noticed that the reduced nickel, determined by the total hydrogen consumption, and the total nickel content determined by atomic absorption (Table 2) in the catalysts agree with each other except for the ion M.D. Romero et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 425-441 435 a) Iex-1/SEM b) Iex-O/TEM c) Imp-I/SEM d) Imp-OirEM Fig. 3.

The main reduction peak for this catalyst is located at the maximum temperature used in the test (500) to avoid peak overlap with the montmorillonite samples, which suggests that a temperature of 500 it is not high enough to reduce the nickel in this sample completely. 3.3. Electron microscope measurements The morphology of the nickel in the above samples was determined by electron microscope examination, with the aid of EDX analysis performed in the selected areas. The measurements confirm the above mentioned remarks about the nickel state on the catalysts, related with the temperature of the reduction peaks. For instance, Fig. 3a shows a SEM microphotograph of the catalyst prepared by ion exchange with the aqueous complex (Iex-I); it shows large nickel particles associated with a low reduction temperature. However, it could not be found in any of the several samples analyzed for the catalyst with the ethylenediamine complex (Iex-O), which does not show a significant hydrogen 436 M.D. Romero et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 425-441 consumption at low temperatures. Indeed, most of the nickel particles in this catalyst are very small (Fig. 3b), and are related with high reduction temperatures. These facts can also be seen in the impregnated catalysts. Thus, quite large nickel particles are observed outside the zeolite crystals in the catalyst impregnated with acetylacetonate (Imp-O), Fig. 3c, as well as small ones, Fig. 3d, related with the low and high reduction temperatures, respectively. 3.4. Temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (TPDA) Temperature programmed desorption of ammonia was carried out to compare the acidities of the catalysts. Fig. 4 shows the desorption curves and the Gaussian deconvoluted peaks of the four catalysts studied as well as the desorption of a sample without any nickel content (Base). Since the position of the first desorption peak, weak acidity, is located at the same temperature for the five samples, both the maxima and widths of these peaks were fixed (at 310 and 85, respectively) while fitting the TPDA profiles, whereas they were allowed to shift for the second one, strong acidity. Table 3 gives a quantitative comparison of these values, where the total acidity is the overall amount of ammonia desorbed and the partial acidity is the area under each of the two peaks used to fit the desorption curve. The temperature of the maximum of each peak is also listed. The results show that the acidic properties of the zeolite may be considerably modified after the nickel incorporation, depending on the method and precursor a z (a) Iex-I (b) Iex-O r , (e) Imp-I (d) Imp-O ' 200 300 400 500 200 TEMPERATURE () 300 400 500 TEMPERATURE () h GS h 5 z r c Fig. 4.

Thus, as it can be seen in Table 3, both the total acidity along with the strength distribution (depicted by the area and maximum temperature of the deconvoluted peaks) do not vary when the nickel is incorporated into the catalyst by ion exchange with the aqueous complex, while it absolutely decreases for all the other ones. The reduction of the total acidity is similar in the three catalysts, although substantial differences are found in the strength distribution. The catalysts prepared with the organic precursors (Iex-O, Imp-O) show similar values of the amount of desorbed ammonia corresponding to the weak and strong acidity although the maximum of the impregnated one is found at lower temperature than the ion exchanged one. The reduction of the acidity of these catalysts is mainly ascribed to the strong acidity, decreasing to almost half the value before the nickel was included. On the other hand, the decrease of the acidity of the catalyst prepared by impregnation with nickel(II) nitrate is mostly ascribed to the weak acidity and the maximum temperature of the strong acidity goes down to almost the same temperature as for the other impregnated catalyst. The reason of these decreases of the acidity of the zeolite may be due to a partial block of the zeolite pores by large nickel particles that hinder the ammonia to enter them, and also by deactivation of the acid centers by deposition of carbonaceous deposits during the calcination of the catalysts prepared with the organic precursors. Since these catalysts have similar acidic properties and the preparation by ion exchange generates a highly dispersed nickel phase, the deactivation has to be the dominant effect in the reduction of the acidity, while the pore blockade by large nickel particles is the only variable of the catalysts prepared by impregnation with nickel(II) nitrate. 3.5. Hydroisomerization of n-decane The catalysts were tested for their activity and selectivity of the hydroisomerization of n-decane. Table 4 lists the reaction parameters obtained with the four catalysts while Fig. 5 displays the selectivities towards the different products arranged by the number of carbon atoms. The results show, as it should be 438 M.D. Romero et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 425-441 Table 4 Hydroisomerization of n-decane: reaction parameters Catalyst Iex-I ion Iex-O ion Imp-I Imp-O technique exchange exchange impregnation impregnation precursor [Ni(Hz0)612' [Ni(CZHBNZ)3]2+ (N03)2M-61-120 AcNi X(Mol T a 53.9 27.3 5.1 8.2 X1 /XT (%) b 6.3 5.9 17.6 8.5 S' (mol-%) 1 78.3 73.9 84.7 74.2 XT,Overall conversion. b XConversion towards n-decane isomers. ` Selectivity towards isomers in the liquid product. expected, the significance of the nickel incorporation method over the activity and selectivity of the bifunctional catalysts. The overall conversions ( XT) of the catalysts prepared by ion exchange are higher than the conversion of the impregnated ones, regardless of the precursor used. Moreover, the selectivities of the impregnated catalysts follow different patterns than the ion exchange ones with respect to the significant increase of the n-decane isomer selectivity, as it can be seen in Fig. 5. It should be also noticed that the overall conversion of the catalysts prepared with both precursors by ion exchange differs greatly, whereas the catalyst selectivity, measured by the isomerization rate (XI/XT) and the selectivities are similar. However, a contrary behavior is found with both catalysts prepared by impregnation, reaching similar overall conversion with different catalyst selectivity, which is larger for the catalyst prepared with the nickel(II) nitrate.

M.D. Romero et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 425-441 439 The classical bifunctional mechanism that comprises both acid and metal catalytic functions [52,53] must be considered to explain the differences found on the activity and selectivity of these dual-functional catalysts. The route involves five elemental steps: (1) formation of olefins at the metal sites, (2) transport of olefins from the metal to the acid sites, (3) isomerization to secondary or tertiary carbocations or cracking to smaller ones (through carbenium ion intermediates), (4) transport of the olefins formed on the acid to metal sites, and (5) formation of paraffins at the metal sites. Thus, the dehydrogenation-hydrogenation on the metal site acts as the initiation/termination step in the formation of olefins and the isomerization and cracking takes place on the acidic sites through ion carbenium chemistry [11,12]. The relative strength and distribution of the metal/acid balance plays an essential role in the activity and selectivity of the catalyst [54-56]. It is often assumed that catalysts are ideal when the metal component is present in sufficient excess so that the reactions in the acid sites may be considered as the rate-limiting step [57,58], because an equilibrium between saturated and unsaturated species is achieved. However, when the metal content is small enough, the formation of olefins is the rate-limiting step and the activity mainly depends on the metal function, increasing as the metal function does. The lower overall conversion obtained with the impregnated catalysts compared to the ion exchanged ones cannot only be explained in terms of its acidity, but also by the acid/metal balance. Although the impregnated catalysts have similar acidity and metal content as the catalyst prepared by ion exchange with the ethylenediamine complex (Iex-O), the nickel dispersion and consequently, the exposed surface is lower. Thereby, the reaction on the metal sites is the rate-limiting step in these catalysts which causes that the acid sites cannot completely be used like in the ion exchanged ones. On the other hand, the differences found in the overall conversion between both ion exchanged catalysts, by using the aqueous and ethylenediamine complex precursors (Iex-I and Iex-O), are related with the major acidity of the first one since the nickel dispersion is high enough to render the reaction on the acid centers as the rate-limiting step. Finally, the higher isomerization/cracking ratio (XI/XT) of the impregnated catalysts with regard to the ion exchanged one is interpreted in terms of the nickel particle size. As the four catalysts have the same nickel content but the impregnated ones have less nickel dispersion, this involves a higher metal particle size in these catalysts that certainly raises the isomerization in relation to the cracking because of the hydrogen spillover effect [59,60]. 4. Conclusions In the hydroisomerization of n-decane, the catalytic properties of the Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst are markedly influenced by the nickel incorporation 440 M.D. Romero et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 425-441 method, precursor and technique, modifying both the metallic and acid catalytic activity. Thus, the impregnated catalysts exhibit a lower catalytic activity than the ion exchanged ones. It was also seen that different selectivity and similar activity are being found when the impregnation technique is used, whereas no differences in the selectivity and the activity were found by using the ion exchanged one. The catalysts, prepared by the impregnation technique and related in major or minor extension, have a low nickel dispersion, whatever precursor is used. This effect reduces not only the hydrogenating activity but also its acid activity by a partial blockade of the zeolite micropores. Thereby, the catalytic activity of these catalysts is small, being mainly determined by the metallic function, and no changes in the activity with the different precursors are found, due to the control of the metallic function. However, the acid function is the rate-limiting step in the catalysts prepared by the ion exchange technique and the major effect of the precursor is associated with its nature, organic or inorganic, because the former causes a decrease of the catalyst activity due to deactivation of the acid sites during the calcination step. This decrease accounts for the differences in the activity of the catalysts prepared by ion exchange; the acid function acts as the controlling step. Thus, lower activity is achieved when the organic precursor is used, because of the smaller acidity of this catalyst, even with a higher nickel dispersion. References [1] N.Y.

Two preparation methods, ion exchange and impregnation, using different nickel precursors were tested. Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (TPDA), thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), electronic microscopy (SEM, TEM) and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AA) techniques were used to characterize the catalysts. The n-decane hydroisomerization was selected as a test reaction to determine the catalyst activity. These experiments were carried out in a basket type reactor, using a catalyst ground with sodium montmorillonite. The method of nickel incorporation was found to be an important indicator for the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, having a significant influence not only on its hydrogenating properties but also on its acidity. The nickel incorporation technique was mainly affecting the nickel dispersion, while it was affecting both functions, metallic and acid, when the precursor was modified.

        "dc:description": "The influence of the method used for the metal incorporation, technique and precursor compound on the hydroisomerization of n-decane over the bifunctional Ni HZSM-5 catalyst was studied. Two preparation methods, ion exchange and impregnation, using different nickel precursors were tested. Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (TPDA), thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), electronic microscopy (SEM, TEM) and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AA) techniques were used to characterize the catalysts. The n-decane hydroisomerization was selected as a test reaction to determine the catalyst activity. These experiments were carried out in a basket type reactor, using a catalyst ground with sodium montmorillonite. The method of nickel incorporation was found to be an important indicator for the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, having a significant influence not only on its hydrogenating properties but also on its acidity. The nickel incorporation technique was mainly affecting the nickel dispersion, while it was affecting both functions, metallic and acid, when the precursor was modified.",
