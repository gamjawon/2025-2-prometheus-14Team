(Received November 23, 1988; accepted May 22, 1989) Summary In the reactions of (+)-apopinene (1) in the presence of hydrogen, an optically active hydrocarbon-like layer forms over the surface of Pd catalysts. It is suggested that this layer adsorbs one isomer preferentially, and that it provides the sites for both isomerization and hydrogenation. Introduction Recently we have utilized the (+)-apopinene (6,6-diMe-l.R,5.R-bicyclo- [3.1.1]-2-heptene) (1) molecule in order to explore the possibility of charac- terizing the surface of metal catalysts by inexpensive chemical means. In the presence of hydrogen, on transition metal catalysts this compound under- goes both isomerization and hydrogen addition [1-6]. The specific feature of this reaction is that the other stereoisomer, which forms during isomeriza- tion (racemization), gives the same product as the original on hydrogenation (Fig. 1). Apopinane 3 Fig. 1.

Equation (1) can be derived from two differential equations (2) and (3) describing the isomerization process and the hydrogenation, respectively. rB=fei(A-B)-feaB (2) rc=fea(A+B)PH (3) These are the equations of first-order processes with respect to the olefins in both reactions. However, a more thorough analysis of the exper- imental data revealed that neither the isomerization nor the addition was a first-order reaction for these reactants. Experimental Materials (+)-Apopinene was prepared from (+)-myrtenal over 5% Pd/BaS04 catalyst (product of Aldrich Chemical Co.). The (+)-apopinene formed was distilled out of the reaction flask continuously. Thus, high optical yield could be achieved. Catalyst preparation and characterization The Pd/SiO^ catalysts were prepared using Davison Grade 56 silica gel support by conventional impregnation and ion exchange methods [4]. For some catalysts (0.65%, 0.083% Pd loading), the support was steam treated before metal deposition, in order to obtain a more uniform pore distribu- tion. The catalysts were characterized through H; chemisorption in a static chemisorption apparatus [3], and through determination of particle size with a Hitachi H500H transmission electron microscope. The preparation and characterizing data of the catalysts are shown in Table 1. Hydrogenation and analytical procedures The reactions were performed in the liquid phase in a well-stirred static batch reactor at ambient temperature and atmospheric hydrogen pressure. The hydrogenation was monitored by GC and with the measurement of hydrogen consumption. The amount of saturation, determined by GC, was in close agreement with the gas uptake. 355 TABLE 1 Characteristic data of the Pd/SiO^ catalysts Loading Dispersion (%) Method of preparation (%) Chemisorp a TEM\" 1.17 41 36 impregnation 0.65 68 42 ion exchange 0.46 61 58 ion exchange 0.083 83 61 ion exchange ^Hy chemisorption in a static system. b Assuming octahedral surface structure. The unreacted apopinene was separated from the reaction mixture, its optical rotation was measured, and the extent of its isomerization (racemiza- tion) was calculated. More details can be found in a previous paper [3]. Results and discussion The analysis of the experimental data obtained on these four catalysts (Table 2) shows quite interesting features. The data indicate that the optical isomerization displays zero-order behaviour with respect to (+)-apopinene over a considerable range, and the hydrogenation is also a zero-order reaction in the olefin. This phenomenon can be better seen on Fig. 2, where the percentage of isomerization us. the percentage of hydrogenation has been plotted. This is really a double zero-order behavior (with respect to (+)-apopi- nene), as is shown on Fig. 3. (Only the l-2Iso us. Add graph gives a straight line). The conversion for the isomerization is ~ 35% (which means racemiza- tion is 70%), while for the addition it is ~6%. The zero order with respect to the olefin in the addition can be easily explained. The olefin adsorbs strongly and its surface concentration is con- stant during the reaction. The dissociation of the hydrogen molecule is the rate-limiting step [7]. The surface concentration of the hydrogen is also constant, as its pressure has been kept constant. Interestingly, the racemization is also a zero-order reaction (with respect to (+)-apopinene), though the order is not zero under homogeneous conditions. It should not be the case under heterogeneous conditions either, if the reaction proceeds on the bare metal surface. A literature search revealed that a zero-order reaction (with respect to the substance to be isomerized) in optical isomerization (or one might call it epimerisation) over heterogeneous catalysts is exceptionally rare. In most cases first-order [8 -11] or at least non-zero reaction order [12] has been found. Moreover, in the isomerization of 1-butene, in which the adsorption properties of the isomers do not differ too much, first kinetic order has been 356 TABLE 2 The isomerization-addition data pairs found on stopping the reactions at different conversions % Isomi*-\" % Add1'.\" % Add'1-\" 1.17%Pd/SiOt 0.e5%Pd/SiOi 6.2 1.0 11.5 1.8 7.3 1.1 25.4 3.8 12.7 1.3 33.1 4.7 10.8 1.7 38.7 7.4 14.3 1.9 17.5 3.3 22.9 3.7 0.46% Pd/SiO, 0.083% Pd/SiO-i 8.2 1.7 4.3 0.9 8.3 1.8 7.3 1.7 18.6 3.6 18.6 3.2 23.7 4.8 20.4 3.3 22.7 4.8 28.3 4.9 27.9 6.5 28.3 4.9 28.6 6.9 33.9 6.2 37.5 9.0 \"Isom = B/(A + B + C) ''Add = C/(A + B + C) \"Isom Add pairs belonging to the same reaction time. % Isom %Add Fig. 2.

Only one group states that an epimerization (the cis- trans isomerization of l-methyl-2-alkylcyclopentanes) is a zero-order reac- tion [14]. It is interesting however that the epimerization of 1,2-dimethyl- cyclobutanes is first-order in the hydrocarbon [10]. Actually double zero order has been found in the reactions of 3-methyl-l-pentene over Pd catalysts. The system is very similar to ours, as the optically active com- pound undergoes both isomerization and hydrogenation. Unfortunately, the authors left the phenomenon (which can be recognized from the graph in their paper) without explanation [15]. A zero-order behaviour cannot result from the classical Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for olefin isomerization and hydrogenation [16] either. If a static system is considered, the optical isomers, being essentially identical, must have the same adsorption properties. Consequently, apart from the very initial stage of the reaction, the other isomer should also adsorb with increasing probability as its concentration rises. The two isomers should be in equilibrium. Thus, non-zero order is expected, assuming again that the transformation occurs over a bare metal surface. Recent reports show, however, that this is not necessarily the case. The hydrogenation of olefins, for instance, may occur readily on an active hydrocarbon-like overlayer, in which the covered surface serves as catalyst by transferring hydrogen to the olefin adsorbed in the second layer [16 - 21]. The lifetime of this active layer is fairly long, and the species from which it is formed are not reaction intermediates. In our case such an overlayer, besides being responsible for the hydro- genation of this cyclohexene-like molecule, seems to adsorb one isomer 358 preferentially, i.e. the optically active oleftn makes a reactive and at the same time optically active layer over the catalyst. This overlayer recognizes the (+)-isomer and serves as template for its further adsorption and isomeriza- tion, and is the catalyst for the hydrogenation as well. The existence of such an overlayer is temperature-limited; this enzyme-like catalysis, which requires a template to line up the reactant molecules, can only be carried out below 400 K[ 22]. This might very well be the case for the platinum catalyst as well, but it is not easy to prove experimentally, as optical isomerization is extremely slow compared either to addition on these catalysts or to optical isomeriza- tion on the palladium catalysts.
