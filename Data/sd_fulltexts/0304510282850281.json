The non-supported iron oxide or the xerogeltype silica-supported iron oxide (Fe203) shows an intermediate behaviour. The less active catalyst-s of any type (unsupported, xerogel or zerogel) are those pre-reduced in 142 at 500 C. 'Whey deactivate by carburization and by carbon deposition- A mechanism of the Fischer-Tropsch reaction which takes into account these characteristics is proposed. Introduction It has always been the practice to pre-reduce the iron-based catalysts of the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis with H,, in order to generate the metallic surface required for active catalysts [ 11 . The precursor in these fused or precipitated catalysts is magnetite (Fe30g) [2, 3] and it was found indeed that unreduced catalysts were initially inactive in the FT synthesis and that a subsequent reduction did not improve the catalytic activity [4] . This behaviour may seem unusual, since tile study of phase changes that occur in unsupported iron catalysts shows that the metal is rapidly converted into a mixture of magnetite and iron carbides [ 5, 6] . Carbides are no longer considered as the active phase in this synthesis [7, 8] . This suggests that most, if not all, forms of iron (metallic and ionic) are active in the FT reaction [3] . It has since been shown that over a pre-oxidized iron foil the initial rate of methanation (with 3H2 CO) is increased ten-fold by comparison with the rate an a clean foil [7] . Butt this high activity of the surface oxide decreases with time and simultaneously, as shown by Auger spectra, the surface oxide becomes reduced. In the same way, the reaction with 0304-5!02182/0000-0000!$02.75 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in 'the Nethertards 172 3112 + C,Oz (instead of CO) produces methane, on the initially clean Fe foil with a five-fold rate with respect to the rate of reaction with 3H2 = CO. The active surface is no longer metallic iron but iron oxide, formed by interaction between initial clean iron and CO... As deactivation of the iron foil by surface carbon (inactive) deposition occurs at about the same rate in the C02 reaction as in the CO reaction, it may be concluded that there is a good chance for the oxidized iron (initially or by reaction with C02) to also catalyse the FT reaction, by producing, as does metallic iron, intermediate active carbon through the dissociation of carbon monoxide [7]. When the reactant is C02 the reverse water-gas shift reaction on iron oxide produces CO which, in turn, follows the FT synthesis. The same enhancement of the initial catalytic activity was observed for a pre-oxidized Fe single crystal (111) surface [9] . It is interesting to observe that metallic rhodium, which is a mediocre methanation catalyst [10, 11], becomes quite active after pre-oxidation. Even better, rhodium oxide [12] or rhodium lanthanate [13] are active catalysts for FT synthesis (yielding in addition oxygenated products) where Rh remains in the oxidized state, despite the thermodynamic instability of Rh oxides under the reducing conditions othe FT reaction. It has been shown recently in this laboratory [14] that the activity at the steady state of a non-reduced a-Fe203 precursor (instead of magnetite) which is transformed into Fe304 during the FT reaction is higher than that of the same precursor pre-reduced to a-Fe, which then becomes entirely carburized by the reaction and contains more surface graphitic (inactive) carbon than the non-reduced catalyst. In contrast, the amount of surface active carbon, which is the intermediate in the formation of alkanes, is higher on the non-reduced catalyst [14] . Finally, it is also known that the reduction of iron oxides is tempered by the presence of a dispersing medium [15] such as an inorganic oxide support- However, even for silica, a metalsupport interaction has been recorded [16] which leads to the substitution of SIL-44 for Fear at the tetrahedrally-coordinated cation sites of Fe30c, and results in a ferric enrichment of the octahedral sites- In addition to its dispersing effect (a more divided state of the active phase) the influence of the support is thus extended by making difficult the reduction of iron oxide. Because the oxidized phase is more difficult to carburize and to cover by graphitic (inactive) carbon, the deactivation with time on stream is decreased for supported catalysts [17] . Experimental Three types of catalysts have beer. tested: (i) unsupported ae-Fe203, obtained by decomposition of Fe(N03)3'9H70 at 200 C [ 1Q, 18] , labelled FeZ03(NS); (ii) cL-Fe203 supported on silica (1017o Fe) in a xerogel form [17] prepared by decomposition of silica (Aerosii Degussa) impregnate by iron nitrate precursor, labelled SiFe ZO(); (iii) Fe304 supported on silica (aero- 173 TABLE 1 Composition and nature of solid phases in the catalysts Catalyst Crystalline phase Fe BET total Mean diameter of iron detected by XRDa (o) surface area oxide particles (m2 g-`) determined by XRD P ) Fe203 (NS) a-F e=03 70 95 150 SiFe 10 (X) (I-Fe203 9.5 200 205 SiFe 10 (A) (2D) Fe304; ct-Fe203 10_4 690 110 aThe most abundant iron oxide phase is underlined- gel) (1090 Fe) aerogel, prepared by the autoclave method, labelled SiFe 10(A) (2D) [17] . Table I gives some properties of these catalysts. The presence of Fe304 in the aerogel catalyst SiFe 10(A) (213) is due to 'the reducing conditions (methanol) during its preparation in the autoclave [17] . The catalysts (50 mg) were tested in a differential dynamic microreactor, with H2/CO ratio 9, at I atm. pressure and 60 cm3 min ' flow rate, a reaction temperature of 250 C and a conversion below 590 [18] . The reactants and products were as-ialyzed by gas chromatography. Four types of pretreatments were applied to the catalyst precursors prior to the reaction: (i) non-reducing treatment (He, 1 h at 250 C); (ii) moderatelyreducing treatment (H2, 15 h at 250 OC); (iii) strongly-reducing conventional treatment (H2, 15 h at 500 C); (iv) oxidizing treatment (02, 2 h at 500 C). Experimental results For non-supported iron oxide Fe203(NS), where support-active phase interaction is avoided (which may eventually lead to some modification of the structural evolution or of the catalytic activity), the highest catalytic activity (per g of iron, metal or ion) is recorded after a non-reducing pretreatment (lie at 250 C), as shown in Fig. 1, curve 1. The most disastrous pretreatment is conventional reduction by H2 at 500 `C (curve 3). This catalyst is sintered by the high temperature treatment as shown by the drop in its surface area from 95 to 2 m2 g-1, and it will not be discussed here. However, two other treatments at 250 C (He or H2) do not involve any dramatic change of the surface area, which drops from 95 to 90 mz g` (for He) or to 30 m2 g-' (for H2). It may be therefore assumed that activity curves I and 2 are somewhat correlated to the structural evolution of catalysts. It has not been attempted to measure the dispersion of iron by titration or chemisorption of a gas, because chemisorption of an adsorbate such as CO eras not found to be specific to ionic or zero-valent iron [1.8] . Activity (rate of formation of CH4) curve I of Fig. I for He-treat d catalyst seems to show that the catalyst must be reduced to some extent by the 174 TIME Mrs) Fig. 1.

However the reactants (CO + HZ) do not constitute a reduction medium (for He-treated catalyst) as efficient as that formed by pure H., (in the HZ pretreatment). Indeed CO dissociates on iron, leaving carbon and oxygen [7] . Also, Table 2 shows that He-treated (at 250 C) spent catalyst still contains Fe304 in addition to iron carbide, whereas H2-pre-reduced (at 250 C) catalyst (a-Fe initially) after reaction is entirely converted to carbide. Clearly, He-treated catalyst, prior to the reaction but also during the FT synthesis, was in a more oxidized state than H2-pretreated catalyst. Previous studies [Z4j disclosed that the amount of surface active carbon on He-treated catalyst is higher and the amount of inactive (graphitic) carbon is smaller than on H2-treated catalyst. It is therefore attractive to consider the oxadated state of iron as the phase active in the FT synthesis. There is no doubt however that metallic iron (Of-Fe) is also an active phase (for H2-treated catalyst) and the problem othe active phase has to be solved for the non-reduced (He-treated) catalyst. It is now of interest to observe that the catalyst pretreated with 02 (2 h) at 500 C exhibits a still higher activity in the pseudo-stationary state (curve 4 0Fig. 1), despite \"he fact that its surface dropped from 95 to 17 mz g- 1 by oxygen treatment. Simultaneously, the structure othe spent catalyst as revealed by XRH (Table 2) is that of cL,-Fe203 and Fe304 with only minor amounts of carbide. In other words, the most active catalyst at the pseudostationary state is in the most oxidized state- It has been mentioned above that the carrier _nav inhibit the transformation of the active phase.

Table 2 indeed confirms that silica-supported xerogel SiFe 10(X) pretreated with H2 at 250 C still contains iron in the oxidized state (Fe304) and only a minor amount of a-Fe, whereas the unsupported catalyst Fe20ANS) is entirely reduced by the same pretreatment into a-Fe. After 20 h on stream, the oxidized state of iron is conserved for all types of pretreatment of silica-supported catalyst, except after strong reduction by I-IZ at 500 9C. The initial surface area (200 mz g') of the catalyst SiFe 10(X) is not modified (within 5%) by any these pretreatments. Also, all four activity curves of Fig. 2 may be considered as correlated with the structural, and not textural, changes which are shown in Table 2- For both pretreatments leading to the partial or total reduction into a-Fe of the initial a-Fe203 (Hz at 250 or 500 QC), the initial activity is high (Fig. 2) but it decreases with time on stream to a fairly low level. It is of interest to note that the partially pre-reduced catalyst (H2 at 250 C) containing therefore Fe304 as a major phase (Table 2) is more active than the catalyst pre-reduced to a-''e (H2 at 500 C). Both are carburized (e-Fe2C) after 20 h on steam, but both again conserve the initial phase (Fe304 or a-Fe). The non-prereduced catalysts (He at 250 C or 02 at 500 C), which therefore contain a-Fe203, gradually acquire catalytic activity (Fig. 2) and after 20 h on stream both are partially carburized (FeSC2) but the major part of the active phase is now Fe;04. The highest activity at the steady state is exhibited by the pre-oxidized catalyst (02 at 500 C). This situation is therefore comparable to that of the unsupported catalyst. If the strongly reduced catalyst (H2 at 500 C) is reoxidized (02, 2 h at 500 C) prior to the reaction, its actilrity (curve 5 of Fig. 2) is almost the same a-s that of the pre-oxidized catalyst (02 at 500 C) (curve 4). High surface area (690 m2 CI) of the silica-supported aerogel catalyst [SiFe 10(A) (2D)] corresponds with high dispersion of the Fe30c phase (d = 110 A, Table 1) on this carrier as determined by XII:D and T.E.M. [17] (Transmission Electron Mieroscopy). This surface area is only slightly decreased (ca. 10 0) by any one of the pretreatments (reducing or oxidizing) of the catalyst. Because the active phase is already in the form of magnetite, the moderately reducing pretreatment (H2 at 250 C) was not applied. Instead, a re-oxidation at 500 C of the catalyst reduced at 500 C was attempted, as previously for the xerogel catalyst. The catalytic activity curves obtained after the four pretreatments are shown in Fig. 3. The initial precursor (magnetite, He at 250 C, Table 2) is barely activated by the reaction mixture (curve 1) and its structure remains Dractically unchanged after 20 h on stream. is this precursor is reduced into a-Fe (H2 at 500 C), its activity is slightly higher (curve 2) and is quite comparable to that of the xerogel SiFe 10(X) also reduced into a-Fe M2 at 500 C) (Table 2). The same phases are also present in both pre--reduced catalysts after 20-h on stream (a-Fe a-rid e-FeZC). The highest activity in the FT synthesis ever observed (curve 3) is that of the precursor (Fe3,04) pre-oxidized into cr-Fe20_3 and -y-Fe203 (02 at 500 C). The important point to note is that no traces of carbides are detected in the spent catalyst (Table 2) but only magnetite.

For both types o pretreatment the iron oxide particle diameter is practically the same as for the untreated precursor (Fe304). Summing up, if the supported iron oxide phase brought into reaction is no longer Fe304 (He at 250 C, Table 2) but a'- and y-Fe203 (02 at 500 C; or H=, then 02 at 500 C, Table 2), the activity in the FT synthesis is particularly high and no carbide phase is simultaneously formed. The catalyst is reduced by the reactants only to the state of magnetite (Table 2). The same trend was also observed for the unsupported catalyst and for the supported xerogel catalyst (Table 2, Figs. 1 and 2) but to a smaliar extent. Tile activity in the steady state was always higher ithese last two catalysis were pre-oxidized- The precursor phase was therefore a-FeZ03 which was also converted 3y the reactants into Fe30c but with simultaneous formation of carbide. The unsuppot<ed magnetite as the initial phase is hardly, if at all, activated by the reaction mixture, as was shown recently [Z9] for the commercial fused iron catalyst. The selectivity into various hydrocarbons othe aerogel catalyst is shown in Table 3. The length of hydrocarbon chains is increased after oxidation pretreatment. This shows that the CO insertion (as CHZ) is favoured on pre-oxidized catalysts. Tile same shift towurds higher molecular weight products has been observed or: rhodium.-based oxidized catalysts [1I] , on preaxidized iron foil [71 arid in particular on magnetite itself [20] . 178 TABLE 3 Selectivity (90) of the SiFe 10 (A) (2D) catalyst at the steady state after various pretaeatments Pretreatment sc, SC- SC 3 Sc.

Though X-ray results do not give information regarding the state of the catalyst surface, the activity in the formation of C02 during the FT synthesis may provide insight concerning the state of the surface. Figure 4 shows the rate of formation of COz for the aerogei catalyst SiFe 10(A) (2D) after reducing or after oxidizing pretreatments. The reason C02 is obtained so readily on oxidized catalyst (curves 2 and 3) is because the catalyst surface is covered by magnetite [3] which is a well-known active material for the water-gas shift reaction: CO + HZO -; COZ + HZ. The detailed mechanism of the regenerative participation of magnetite in the shift reaction (Temkin mechanists) was recently confirmed and developed [3] . But if magnetite on oxidized catalysts enables substantial amounts of C02 to be formed (Fig. 4) it simultaneously enables, in a parallel manner, the formation of methane on the same catalysts (Fig. 3). This parallelism is a further argument in favour of the participation of Fe304 in the Fischer-Tropsch reaction. This possibility has been already advanced [ 5, 6] , but because of the presence of other phases in the conventional catalyst (carbides, metallic iron) it has not been forwarded further. This is no longer the case for the aerogel pre-oxidized catalyst, where the only phase detected by XRD after the reaction is magnetite. Discussion The behaviour in the FT synthesis of unsupported and of supported xerogel catalysts after reducing or oxidizing treatments already shows that the oxidized phase may be more active (at the steady state) than the reduced phase. But the formation of a multicomponent system in these catalysts during the reaction (Table 2) does not enable a clear conclusion to be drawn concerning the participation of the oxidized phase.

It has been shown that the reduction of ae-FeZO, into lower. oxides and finally iron proceeds by sequential steps, each phase being in equilibrium with the Css-COZ atmosphere [21] _ The reduction of Fe.,f33 into Fe30, is fast in these conditions, whereas the conversion of Fe304 into Fe0 is much slower, but the reduction of Fe0 into Fe is again fast. The carburization of Fe is a fast process [22] whereas iron oxides cannot be carburized because of the lack of solubility of carbon. The slow rate of reduction of any oxidized phase kinetically stabilizes this phase in a reducing atmosphere [3.2] . Starting with Fe203 this stabilized phase may be Fe304. It has been shown that Css is chemisorbed not only on metallic but also on ionic iron [18j . At 250 C, this adsorption may be dissociative as on metallic iron [7, 23, 24] , and is the source of carbon active in the FT synthesis: Fe(,) f CO - Fe(s)-C t Fe(, -0. There is no thermodynamic restriction for this reaction to occur also on the next stable phase, Fe304, if it is considered that thermodynamic data for both equilibria ate very similar (at 250 C): Fe f CO .-E Fe0 = C aG573 = 10.6 Kcal 2Fe3E?. t CD :~t 3Fe203 + C AGO 523 = 10-8 Kcal If the sequential reduction of magnetite down to Fe is kinetically permitted, the catburiTation of iron by active carbon would be a parallel competitive reaction [25] which decrees the amount of the catalytically active phase. A second process which also contributes to the decrease of the catalytic activity is the `polymerization' otl-ie active carbon [7] . This phenomenon seems to be favoured by the presence of reduced iron but is seldom observed 180 on magnetite [26]. Because magnetite is the only phase observed in the pre-oxidized spent aerogel, its deactivation ~b5= carbon `polymerization' and by carburization are avoided and the catalytic activity of the preoxidized catalyst would be essentially due to the sequence of surface steps: 3Fe203(s) + H2 --> 2Fe30c,s) + H=O (1) 2Fe30,,(s) + CO = 3Fe203(s) + C(active) (2) C(a,:,e) + 2H, - CH4 and homologues It is probable that, in reaction (2) of this redox system, oxygen left by dissociza tive adsorption of CO on Fe304 is removed by H2 (as H20) and net by CO, as shown in reaction (1). Indeed, the ratio of the rates of formation of H20 and of COZ at the steady state (after 20 It on stream) is 14.5 and 16 for both oxidized (02 at 500 C, or H, and then 02 at 500 9C) aerogel catalysts, whereas it is only 8 for the reduced (H2 at 500 C) aerogel. This high ratio would probably be still higher without the water-gas shift reaction. The final question to be answered is the lack of activity of the aerogel SiFe 10(A) (2D) catalyst containing initially iron in the form of magnetite (He at 250 C, Table 2, and Fig. 3). Considering the sequential reduction of Fe203 by the reaction mixture (CO + H_): Fe203 - Fe304 -I, FeO. - Fe - Fe C, with high kinetic potential barriers between steps for an aerogel-supported catalyst, the FT synthesis on pre-oxidized catalyst (Fe203) starts 'uphill' with respect to the solid phase and may not go beyond the barrier (Fe304)- Conversely, the FT synthesis on a not preoxidized catalyst (He at 250 C) containing magnetite (Table 2), starts `downhill' with reduction continuing and ending by the formation of carbide (Table 2). This situation seems to be also observed for all other catalysts of Table 2. If the initial phase after the pretreatment is a-Fe203, the catalytic activity at the steady state is always higher than for the pretreatment which leaves iron in a partially or totally reduced stated. Unfortunately, for non-aerogel catalysts (unsuppcrted and supported xerogel) the oxidized state is not well conserved during the FT synthesis, unlike the aerogel catalysts. If the catalyst is pre-reduced, its behaviour is that of the conventional reduced iron catalyst which becomes carburized end covered by inactive carbon. References i M. E. Dry, in J.

No. 231), 43 boulevard du 11 Novembre 1918, 69622 Villeurbanne Cedex France Iron oxide (Fe2O3) dispersed on silica aerogel exhibits a catalytic activity at the steady state in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis which is about 300 times higher (per g of iron) than the activity of the conventional fused iron reduced catalyst, and it does not deactivate by carburization or by deposition of inactive carbon. The non-supported iron oxide or the xerogel-type silica-supported iron oxide (Fe2O3) shows an intermediate behaviour. The less active catalysts of any type (unsupported, xerogel or aerogel) are those pre-reduced in H2 at 500°C. They deactivate by carburization and by carbon deposition. A mechanism of the Fischer-Tropsch reaction which takes into account these characteristics is proposed. References 1 M.E. Dry J.R. Anderson M.
