Graphical abstract This special issue is dedicated to Professor Enze Min in honor of his 90th birthday. He won the National Supreme Science and Technology Award in 2007, and he has received wide recognition as “the founder of applied catalysis for petroleum refining, the forerunner of independent innovation of petrochemical technology, and the pioneer in the area of green chemistry in China”. This special issue is dedicated to Professor Enze Min on the occasion of his 90th birthday. It is in recognition of his outstanding contributions to many aspects in the fields of applied catalysis and chemical engineering. Professor Min was born on February 8, 1924 in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China. He earned his B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering at the National Central University in 1946. He then went to the United States, where he obtained his M.S. (1948) and Ph.D (1951) degrees, under the guidance of Professor J. H. Koffolt from The Ohio State University. After spending four years as a Senior Chemical Engineer at the Nalco Chemical Company in Chicago, he returned to China in 1955 and joined the Research Institute of Petroleum Processing. Over the past five decades, Professor Min has been developing novel oil refining catalysts. His research has been instrumental in supplying the technical foundations for manufacturing petroleum-processing catalysts, and for promoting the rapid growth and development of the oil refining industry in China. His research projects have focused on fabricating novel catalytic materials that have led to numerous applications in the area of catalyst and process technologies. Throughout his career, he has been an active supporter of green chemistry projects, and has successfully investigated many environmentally-friendly chemical processes and technologies in China. He has constantly supported the sustainable development of catalytic science and technology for petroleum refining and petrochemical industry in China. He has co-authored research papers and published several influential books. He is an excellent teacher and has been a mentor to many talented graduate students, scientists, and engineers in China's petroleum refining and petrochemical industry. Professor Min has received numerous prizes, awards, and honors. He was elected to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1980, the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World in 1993, and the Chinese Academy of Engineering in 1994. He received the “Distinguished Alumni Award” from The Ohio State University in 1983 and 1989, and the Prize for Scientific and Technological Progress from the Ho Leung Ho Li Foundation in 1994. In 2006, he was the inaugural recipient of the China Catalysis Achievement Award and in 2007 he won the State Supreme Science and Technology Award. Because of his remarkable achievements, he has received wide recognition as the founder of applied catalytic science for petroleum refining, the forerunner of independent innovation of petrochemical technology and a pioneer in the area of green chemistry in China. Professor Min has been active in both domestic and international academic activities. He has served as Vice President, Chief Engineer, and Chairman of the Academic Committee at the Research Institute of Petroleum Processing, and also Chairman of the Academic Degree Conferment Committee at the China Petroleum and Chemicals Corporation. He has served as Deputy Director of the Division of Chemistry at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He was the inaugural Chairman of the Chinese Catalysis Society and the Chairman of the Committee of Green Chemistry at the Chinese Chemical Society. He was on the Editorial Board of many scientific journals, such as Applied Catalysis. He has initiated numerous academic collaborations and partnerships, such as chaired the 21st Thematic Forum-Research program of the 14th World Petroleum Congress and co-chaired the 15th International Zeolite Conference. This special issue honors Professor Min as he approaches his 90th birthday. He remains active and energetic, and continues to lead and inspire us to explore novel catalytic science and develop new catalytic technologies in the areas of petroleum refining, petrochemicals, and green chemistry. It is with our greatest respects that we wish Professor Min and his wife (Professor Wanzhen Lu, also a Member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) longevity with great health. The majority of the 25-invited articles in this special issue are from Professor Min's former graduate students, collaborators, colleagues, and friends. These articles reflect to some extent the wide research interests of Professor Min, and the current worldwide research frontiers and developments in the field of catalytic science and technology. We are very grateful to the authors, the reviewers, and the editorial office staff of Chinese Journal of Catalysis for their contributions and support. Professor Mingyuan He is Vice Chairman of Academic Committee, Research Institute of Petroleum Processing, China Petroleum and Chemicals Corporation, and Professor in Chemistry Department, East China Normal University. He has made technological innovations in the field of catalytic materials for refining and petrochemicals production. He has made contributions in technological progresses to heavy oil cracking, FCC gasoline octane enhancement, new spec gasoline production, etc. One of his achievements was elected as one of the “Nation's Top Ten Scientific and Technological Achievements” in 1996. He was Co-Chair of 15th International Zeolite Conference, Chair of one forum for 16th World Petroleum Congress, and a member of Editorial Board of Applied Catalysis A: General. In 2000, he has been appointed as Principal Scientist for the State Key Basic Research Program in the field of green chemistry. In 2007, he has been elected as Vice President of International Zeolite Association. He has won numerous awards, prizes, and honors. He received Award from Ho Leung Ho Li Foundation, Hong Kong, in 2001, and the China Catalysis Achievement Award in 2012. He was elected Member of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1995. Professor Haichao Liu received his B.S. and M.S. degree from Sichuan University in 1990 and 1993, respectively, and his Ph.D degree from Research Institute of Petroleum Processing in 1996. From 1997 to 2003, he did postdoctoral research at The University of Tokyo, and The University of California at Berkeley. At the end of 2003, he joined the faculty of Peking University. His research interests currently focus on molecular catalysis and energy chemistry with emphasis on design of new catalysts and control of reaction pathways for selective conversion of biomass and its derivatives, etc. He is a recipient of Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University of the Chinese Ministry of Education in 2005, and National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China in 2008. He received The Distinguished Lectureship Award from The Chemical Society of Japan in 2009, and The National Catalysis Prize for Young Scientists of China in 2012.",
