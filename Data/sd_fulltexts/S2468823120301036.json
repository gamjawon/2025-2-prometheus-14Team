Graphical abstract In this work, fundamental insight into the multifaceted role of co-catalyst in activation, propagation, and chain exchange of vanadocene in the immobilized single-site olefin polymerization catalyst has been obtained. The kinetics were followed for various Al/V ratios, at the same polymerization temperature with aluminium diethyl monochloride (DEAC) or triisobutylaluminium (TIBA) as co-catalyst. The results put forward a plausible deactivation reaction path of the catalyst for aluminium diethyl monochloride (DEAC) with irregular morphology of polyethylene particle due to the interaction between halogen atom and vanadium atom. This experimental set of data is supported by a computational investigation at the DFT level that rationalizes specific effects in the presence of co-catalyst at the molecular scale. This joint investigation offers a basic understanding for further catalyst developments in the field of supported metallocene catalyst for olefin polymerization. Keywords Supported vanadocene catalyst Deactivation Ethylene polymerization Density function theory 1 Introduction As one of the most widely used plastic in the world, polyethylene is produced by polymerization of ethylene promoted by various homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts [1–6]. In comparison to the heterogeneous catalysts for industrial production of polyethylene, such as titanium-based Ziegler-Natta catalyst and chromium-based Phillips catalyst, vanadium based catalyst usually plays a minor role for industrial production of polyethylene due to its low catalytic activity and rapid deactivation [7,8]. Although vanadium-based catalyst has no advantage over chromium-based Phillips catalyst in terms of catalytic activity, the ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene product by vanadium catalyst has attracted increasing attention from both industry and academia [9–14]. Some vanadium catalysts have the ability to perform perfectly random copolymerization for EPDM (ethylene propylene diene monomer) rubber production [15,16]. Nomura and co-workers showed that (arylimido)vanadium(V)-alkylidene complexes exhibit high catalytic activities for ring-opening metathesis polymerization of norbornene due to formation of the electron-deficient metal-alkylidene [17–20]. In addition, di- and trivalent vanadium complexes have shown the potential as precursors to active catalytic systems. C. Lorber et al. concluded that vanadium(Ⅱ) complex gives poor yields of polyethylene, while vanadium(Ⅲ) complex is a particularly efficient catalyst with rapid initial polymerization [21]. M. Dincă and co-workers showed that incorporation of vanadium into metal organic framework by cation exchange is a proper strategy to achieve stable and productive vanadium catalyst for olefin polymerization [22]. V(III)−CH3 moiety has been observed by NMR spectroscopy and transient vanadium(III) species was found in vanadium based ethylene polymerization process [23]. C. Copéret and his group members carried out synthesis and characterization of silica-supported cyclopentadienyl Ln(II) sites (Ln = Yb and Sm) of general formula [(≡SiO)LnCp*] [24]. The amount of grafted complex is consistent with the release of 0.95 equivalent of Cp*H per Yb center and the formation of surface monografted [(≡SiO)YbCp*] species. They speculated that chain growth initiates either by coordination of ethylene or through propagation with a single electron transfer to generate Ln(III) active surface species. Heterogeneous catalyst showed several advantages such as less solvent demand, polyolefin morphological control and economical industrial polymerization processes. Therefore, turning soluble catalyst into heterogenized catalyst can be advantageous. Highly porous silica is an important class of support materials for making polyethylene catalyst. Many researchers focused on the development of improved understanding of how polyethylene catalyst is anchored onto a silica surface, and how the polymerization kinetics are affected by the nature of catalyst complex. Immobilization of metallocene on silica-magnesia support showed higher catalyst activity on ethylene polymerization than those prepared by grafting of metallocene onto bare silica [25]. S. Shaikhutdinov and co-workers studied the Phillips (Cr/SiO2) polymerization catalysts through preparation of a well-defined planar system using Cr physical vapor deposition onto a metal-supported atomically flat silicate film [26]. The Union Carbide catalyst which is synthesized by reaction of CrCp2 with the calcined silica showed high activity toward polymerization of ethylene [27]. In the commercial polymerization process, alkyl aluminum reagents are directly used with the traditional catalysts, such as Ziegler-Natta, metallocene and late-transition-metal catalysts [28–32]. Co-catalysts are largely accepted to act as scavengers and assistants during polymerization. T. de Bruin and co-workers studied the role of co-catalysts in single site iron catalyst for ethylene oligomerization. They found that the co-catalyst is able to generate a cationic alkylated iron species, and the co-catalyst itself is turned into a chlorinated anion [33]. Boisson and co-workers found that varying ratio of the catalyst and co-catalysts not only demonstrated the efficiency of chain transfer but also revealed the equilibrium between the dormant state and the active insertion site [34]. Recently, our group studied the effect of the alkyl aluminum compound on ethylene polymerization reactions with a Cr-V bimetallic catalyst and found that the variety of the co-catalysts does have an impact on the characteristics of polyethylene products [35]. According to the research, Cp2Cr (S-9) catalyst is sensitive to the concentration of co-catalysts and the activity of the polymerization will drop with increasing the concentration of the co-catalysts. Supported Cp2V polyethylene catalyst exhibited similar properties as Cp2Cr supported onto silica gel, which has general tolerance toward the concentration of co-catalysts. In addition, the obtained polyethylene product exhibited different morphology by using different co-catalysts. This phenomenon also confirms that co-catalysts can participate in the process of polymerization and therefore influence the properties of polyethylene product directly. It is generally accepted that propagation of polyethylene chain follows Cossee-Arlman mechanism by consecutive insertion of ethylene monomers. The co-catalysts, such as aluminum diethyl monochloride (DEAC), triisobutylaluminum (TIBA), trimethylaluminum (TMA), are widely utilized to promote polymerization reaction [36,37]. However, the mechanism of the co-catalyst effects on ethylene polymerization is rarely reported, and most of the researches carried out using TMA as the model in some recent DFT studies [38,39]. This work is initially aimed at exploring the promotive effects of the co-catalysts on the vanadocene catalyst, which manufactures high-density polyethylene with different morphology using different co-catalysts at room temperature. Experiments were performed in heptane with Cp2V supported on silica gel as the catalyst in the presence of TIBA or DEAC as the co-catalysts. Furthermore, we reported a combined kinetic study and DFT mechanistic investigation on ethylene polymerization in order to gain some new insights into this polymerization process. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials Vanadocene (VCp2, bis(η5-2,4-cyclopentadien-1-yl)vanadium) was obtained from Strem Chemical. Silica gel (Davison 955, surface area 270.4 m2 g−1, pore volume 1.65 cm3 g−1, and average pore size 24.5 nm) was donated by Qilu Branch Co., SINOPEC. Triisobutylaluminum (TIBA, 1.0 M in heptane) and aluminum diethyl monochloride (DEAC) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The high purity dry air (total impurity <1 ppm, dew point of H2O < −80 ℃) was directly used without further purification. The high-purity nitrogen (N2 ≥ 99.999 %) was further purified by passing through one column of 4A molecular sieves (purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) for dehydration and one column of sliver molecular sieves (28 wt% of silver(I) oxide on alumina, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) for deoxidation. Commercial gas purification equipment, which was purchased from Dalian Samat Chemicals Co., Ltd., was directly used for purification of the gases including high-purity nitrogen and ethylene monomer for ethylene polymerization by passing through two large columns filled with different molecular sieves for dehydration and deoxidation. AR grade n-hexane and n-heptane (purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), were firstly purified by 4A molecular sieves and subsequently purged through distillation in the presence of sodium metal slices and diphenyl ketone as indicator until the indicator showed pure blue before use. 2.2 Catalysts preparation All the processes involved air or moisture sensitive compound were carried out with standard Schlenk technique under nitrogen atmosphere. First, about 10 g silica gel compacted with distilled water was heated to 120 °C and dried in air for 12 h. The mixture was placed in a quartz tube fitted with a sintered quartz disk, and then dry air was blown up through the disk at a rate of 600 ml min−1. Afterward, the tube was placed in an electric furnace equipped with a temperature controller for calcination. The furnace temperature was raised at a rate of 4 min−1 to 600 ℃ and kept for 4 h. Thereafter, the support was cooled down to room temperature and transferred into the glove box under purified nitrogen. Second, a solution of Cp2V (90 mg, 0.49 mmol) in 20 ml n-hexane was added to a slurry of 2 g of SiO2 in n-hexane (20 ml). After gentle stirring for 16 h at room temperature, the pale purple material supported vanadocene catalyst was filtered, rinsed with hexane (5 × 4 ml), and dried at room temperature over night. ICP analysis: found (%) for V 1.21 %. 2.3 Ethylene polymerization experiments The polymerization was carried out in a 300 ml Parr stainless-steel reactor equipped with a control system that kept the temperature within ±0.1 °C of the set point. During the polymerizations, the impeller rotated at 520 rpm in order to keep the reaction medium well mixed. Before polymerization, the reactor was heated to 100 °C, evacuated and refilled with nitrogen for five times to reduce the oxygen level. The reactor was firstly charged with 60 ml of dry heptane. Then a certain amount of co-catalysts was injected into the reactor through a bypass with a long needle which could stretch into the reactor and another 50 ml heptane was charged into the reactor to clean the bypass. Then the catalyst suspension (10 ml heptane) was transferred into a specially constructed bomb that allowed the addition of catalyst to the reactor in a single pulse. The bomb apparatus included a bypass so that once the catalyst had been added, the ﬂow of ethylene could continue. When the reactor temperature was increased to the polymerization set point, valve connected to the catalyst bomb was opened to start the polymerization with ethylene line connected to the bomb. The instantaneous consumption of monomeric ethylene was also recorded by an on-line mass ﬂow meter (Brooks SLA5860). Once closing the ethylene uptake line, polymerizations were stopped and the reactor was depressurized. Then, the polymer powder was added into 200 ml of ethanol/HCl and kept the polymer suspension overnight. Finally, the polymer suspension was filtered, washed with ethanol, and left to dry overnight at 60 °C in an oven. 2.4 Inductively coupled plasma Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) was used to determine the metal content of the supported catalysts. The ﬂow rates of plasma gas and auxiliary gas were 15.0 and 1.50 l min−1, The power of the ICP spectrometer (Varian 710-ES) was 1.10 kW. The pressure of nebulizing gas was 200 kPa and the pump speed was 13 rpm. 2.5 Differential scanning calorimetry The melt temperature of the polyethylene was determined by TA DSC Q200. About 5 mg polyethylene was weighed into an aluminum pale and a blank pale was viewed as a reference. It was then heated by a rate of 10 °C min−1 to 160 °C and kept at this temperature for 5 min. Polyethylene was again heated to 160 °C at the same rate after being cooled down to 40 °C at 10 °C min−1. The melt temperature of each heating cycle was calculated from the maximum value and integral area of the heating curve. 2.6 High temperature gel permeation chromatography MW was determined by High Temperature Gel Permeation Chromatography (HT-GPC), with two PL gel-Olexis columns at 160 °C. 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) stabilized with 0.5 wt% butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT) was used as solvent and polystyrenes (PS) with narrow MWD were took as standard sample. 2.7 Computational details All theoretical calculations were carried out with the Gaussian 09 program package [40]. Geometry optimization was performed without any symmetry constraint by using B3LYP functional in combination with the split valence double-zeta basis set def2-SVP for all atoms [41]. The D3 version of Grimme’s dispersion was incorporated into the geometry optimizations. In addition, harmonic vibrational frequency calculation was used to confirm whether the structures have been properly optimized and each transition state was further verified through full intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations [42]. The energies of all structures were refined by carrying out single-point energy calculations using the B3LYP, M06, M06L and M062X functional in combination with a large triple-zeta basis set def2-TZVP. The conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) was employed to obtain the solvation free energies with heptane as the model solvent [43]. Combining the gas-phase def2-SVP and def2-TZVP electronic energies, the CPCM-corrected def2-SVP energy, and the free-energy correction yields the solution-phase free energies that were used to compare the various reaction pathways. That is, the relative free energy was calculated using the following equation: Δ G A = Δ E e l e c + Δ E t h e r m a l − T Δ S + Δ G s o l v where ΔG is the free energy change relative to the separated reactants for species A; ΔE elec is the total electronic energy change in vacuum; ΔE thermal is the total internal thermal energy change including the contributions due to translation, rotational, and vibrational motions; ΔS is the total solute entropy change; and ΔG solv is the solvation free energy change in a specific solvent. Unless we specify otherwise, the Gibbs free energy should be taken as referring to combination of the single-point electronic energies at def2-TZVP level of theory, the solvation free energies, and the vibrational free-energy corrections (303.15 K, 25 atm) at B3LYP-D3/def2-SVP level. Interestingly, Falivene and Talaricoc have reported that the calculated Gibbs free energy barriers could be significantly improved by applying a direct correction of the translational entropy term in the investigation of the β-H transfer and β-H elimination for zirconocene catalyzed propylene polymerization [44]. Lledos, Ujaque, and Maseras recently suggested that the modification to the standard ideal gas/rigid rotor/harmonic oscillator (IGRRHO) approach shows no obvious improvement in calculating the total entropy in solution, and the errors in the translational and rotational entropies are mainly from the lack of dispersion forces in the calculations [45]. Harvey and Sunoj have also reported in a recent paper that none of these corrections to the IGRRHO approach are necessary [46]. Herein, the dispersion-corrected DFT functionals were employed to yield accurate potential energies, and the free energy correction were obtained by using the standard IGRRHO treatments. It has been shown that the chain initiation proceeds on the triplet potential energy surface, as the singlet and quintet species are lying higher in Gibbs free energy than that of the corresponding triplet geometry. Therefore, only the B3LYP energies computed on the triplet surface are discussed below, and all other energies are provided in the Supporting Information. 3 Result and discussion The polymerization process was carried out in a 300 ml Parr stainless-steel reactor with adding TIBA or DEAC as a second stage activator. Most of the vanadium polyethylene catalyst showed proper activity toward ethylene polymerization with DEAC as co-catalyst. Therefore, these categories of co-catalysts were first taken into account. Table 1 shows the performance of the catalyst in ethylene polymerization. From entries 1–4, polyethylene with TIBA showed lower molecular weight than that with DEAC because of chain transfer reaction. From entries 3–10, temperature and Al/V ratio were also taken into consideration. It was found that activity increases slightly with increasing Al/V ratio from 5 to 10. However, there was a decline in activity when the Al/V ratio was further increased to 20 or 40. Moderate Al/V ratio is necessary to start polymerization reaction, thus indicating that excess concentration of co-catalysts have an unfavorable effect on the activity and molecular weight slightly decreased with increasing the amount of co-catalyst. Entry 5 demonstrated the fact that polymerization won’t occur without co-catalysts and Entry 10 indicated that high temperature also seemed to have a detrimental influence on the polymerization. The activity of entry 10 decreased rapidly after 300 s and then the polymerization terminated in the end. From entries 6–10, it is found that difference of activity between 30 °C and 45 °C seems to be slightly narrow and low temperature is able to accelerate the reaction rate. In addition, high temperature led to decomposition and deactivation of vanadocene catalyst. The morphology of the polyethylene which was produced with TIBA or DEAC showed different characteristics (Fig. 1 ). The shapes of polyethylene particle differ from each other in the case of same magnification, and the surface of the polyethylene activated with DEAC is much rougher than that activated with TIBA. The existence of the polyethylene fibber between the particles and the irregular surface of the polyethylene particles were characterized compared to the smooth surface of particles activated with TIBA. This means that entangle of polyethylene occurred on the surface of particle during polymerization if co-catalyst varies. When polyethylene activated with DEAC was taken out from the reactor, these polyethylene particles stuck to the stirring paddle rather than sinking in the bottom of reactor. This phenomenon proved the fact that polyethylene activated with TIBA showed better graininess. Meanwhile, crystallization temperature and melting point of the polyethylene diverge slightly due to the category of the activator. On the basis of the similar polymerization condition, this result shows that the co-catalysts have impact on the formation of the polyethylene particle, and the halogen atom might involve in the process of the polymerization. ICP analysis of supported vanadocene catalyst gives 1.21 wt% V, which is very close to the calculated percentage of 1.26 wt%. The kinetic profiles with varying co-catalysts dosage over different co-catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 [47]. The most significant variation at four reaction conditions is that polymerization activated with DEAC showed faster deactivation than that activated with TIBA at the same condition. The consumption of ethylene reduced slightly due to the embedding of the actively catalytic centers. The polymerization activated with DEAC showed rapid deactivation after run time of 2250s. This result also demonstrated that co-catalysts played a key role in the whole catalytic cycle and the existence of halogen atom in the reaction system has a close relationship to the polymerization activities and catalyst deactivation. Furthermore, TIBA exhibited better performance and more stable activity than DEAC toward this vanadocene catalyst. Meanwhile, small amount of co-catalyst is required to activate this system, which goes against common cognition that metallocene catalyzed olefins polymerization with large excess of methylaluminoxane (MAO) or modified MAO (MMAO). This property is similar to the chromocene in ethylene polymerization, but the difference between two catalysts is the activity during polymerization [48]. Supported chromocene catalyst exhibit highly active reaction rate toward ethylene compared to the vanadocene catalyst. However, chromocene catalyst is sensitive to the category and concentration of the co-catalysts, which goes against the investigation on the influence of the co-catalysts. Meanwhile, vanadocene catalyst exhibits tolerance toward halogen atom, which makes it a proper candidate to investigate the mechanism of supported metallocene catalyst. The catalyst activated with DEAC has manufactured polyethylene with higher molecular weight, but with more obvious rapid deactivation. The experimental characterization of these mechanisms is inadequate to fully describe this supported vanadocene catalyst. Therefore, we have designed two molecular models in order to investigate the effect of co-catalyst on ethylene polymerization catalyzed by the supported vanadocene catalysts (Fig. 3 ). Model 1 is an extended model with a bulky siloxane cage terminated with hydrogen atoms in order to model the effect of the unhydroxylated silica support, while Model 2 is a striped down model terminated with hydroxyl groups in order to model the effect of the hydroxyl groups that may appear on the amorphous silica surface. As ethylene might participate in the initiation of ethylene polymerization, we first proposed four plausible pathways for initiation of the polymerization with DEAC as co-catalyst (Fig. 4 ). T. de Bruin found that for [PhOAlMe2]2 and the MAO model, chloride anion formation is endothermic, and moreover, the dichloride anion is thermodynamically slightly more stable [33]. The complexes composed of vanadium cationic model and the dichloride anionic aluminum model have been optimized. The DFT calculations mainly focus on the influence of halogen atom on chain initiation and chain termination, which may shed some light on the co-catalyst effect on ethylene polymerization as well as the catalyst deactivation. Mechanism of Chain Initiation . There are two forms of chain initiation using DEAC as the activator: i) two ethyl functional groups approach the vanadium center, or ii) ethyl group and chlorine approach the vanadium center. The initiation in the absence of ethylene (A1-A2, A3-A4) and the initiation with coordination of ethylene (A5-A6, and A7-A8) have been investigated in order to elucidate the chain initiation mechanism. The initiation reaction proceeds on the low-lying triplet potential energy surface (Table S1). All the reported Gibbs free energies in Fig. 5 are relative to the most stable complex (A3) plus the corresponding number of ethylene molecule, computed using the B3LYP functional. For comparison, the energies computed using the M06, M06L and M062X functionals are listed in Table S2. Without the assistance of ethylene molecule, the alkyl group transfer from the dichloride anion to the vanadium center is thermodynamically disfavored as A2 and A4 are lying above the initial complexes A1 and A3, respectively. The initiation is likely to happen with the coordination of ethylene. The activation barrier is 22.2 kcal mol−1 and 19.7 kcal mol−1 over model catalyst 1, and 21.7 kcal mol−1 and 21.2 kcal mol−1 over model catalyst 2 for the initiation route of (A5-A6) and (A7-A8), respectively. The difference of the Gibbs free energy barrier between the route (A5-A6) and the route (A7-A8) is 2.5 kcal mol-1 over Model 1, and 0.5 kcal mol−1 over Model 2. Clearly, the absence of the hydroxyl group and the interaction between the chlorine atom and the vanadium center facilitate the alkylation process. Route (A7→A8) is the most facile pathway for the chain initiation due to the inductive effect of halogen atom and the thermodynamic driving force of the low-lying product. Fig. 6 shows a geometrical representation of the transition states for chain initiation promoted by ethylene and DEAC. The interaction between vanadium center and chlorine ligand is much stronger than interaction between vanadium center and ethyl group as indicted by the distance of 2.467 Å for Cl···V (A7-8TS) and 2.702 Å for V···C1 (A5-6TS) over Model 1. This inductive effect of the chlorine ligand facilitates the activation and the insertion of ethylene, as evidenced by a slightly longer CC double bond length of 1.429 Å (A7-8TS) in comparison to 1.421 Å (A5-6TS) in ethylene molecule, and a shorter C4···C5 distance of 2.199 Å (A7-8TS) with respect to 2.280 Å of the C2···C3 distance in A5-6TS. In the calculation on the other activator TIBA, the ethyl groups were used as a simplified model to represent the isobutyl ligands. There are two plausible routes for the chain initiation promoted by the TIBA as the activator (Figure S1). Initiation route (B1-B2) is endergonic with increase of the Gibbs free energy by 6.2 kcal mol−1. The Gibbs free energy barrier for the route (B3-B4) is 22.7 kcal mol−1 over Model 1 and 25.1 kcal mol-1 over Model 2, respectively. Similarly to the route in DEAC, the absence of the hydroxyl group in Model 1 shows a promotive effect to facilitate the alkylation process (22.7 kcal mol−1 vs. 25.1 kcal mol-1). Mechanism of Chain Propagation. Similar to most of the transition-metal catalyzed ethylene polymerization, chain propagation is believed to follow Cossee-Arlman mechanism in which ethylene molecule coordinates to the vanadium center and then inserts into the VC bond consecutively (Fig. 7 ) [49,50]. Chain propagation is primarily determined by the kinetic factors including the electronic effects and the steric effects as introduced by choosing different terminal groups in the model catalysts. Therefore, three models of the vanadium active site were chosen as the starting point for the chain propagation reaction, with H group, ethyl group and i-butyl group as the terminating group R1. The relative Gibbs free energies (kcal mol−1) for chain propagation computed using B3LYP functional are listed in Table 2 , while the energies computed using the M06, M06L and M062X functionals are provided in the Supporting Information (Table S3-S5). By considering the second ethylene insertion, the barriers are 15.1 kcal mol-1 for H over Model 1 and 16.2 kcal mol-1 for H over Model 2, respectively. The difference of the insertion barriers between two models may result from the effect of adjacent hydroxyl functional group in Model 2. The steric hindrance of the terminating groups shows influence on the insertion barriers as linear and less bulky polyethylene chain facilitates the ethylene insertion. When the bulky group i-Bu is introduced in the active site, the insertion barrier of the second ethylene increase to 19.2 kcal mol-1 for Model 1 and 19.4 kcal mol-1 for Model 2, respectively. For small terminating groups (H, Et), the barriers for the successive insertion of the second ethylene monomer are slightly lowered due to a plausible chain relaxation after propagation of the polymer chain by the insertion of the first ethylene monomer. Mechanism of Chain Termination . There are three typical routes for chain termination including the route through β-H transferring to vanadium center, β-H transferring to monomer, and chain transferring to co-catalysts (Fig. 8 ). The energy barriers of β-H elimination and H transfer to monomer were computed for the terminal alkyl chains of vanadium catalyst. Although the direct chain elimination through β-H transferring to vanadium center only needs to overcome a moderate activation barrier of 14.7 kcal mol−1 for Model 1, however, this reaction path is disfavored thermodynamically with an endergonicity of 11.6 kcal mol−1. The energy barrier of chain elimination through β-H transferring to monomer is 19.9 kcal mol−1 for Model 1, which is higher than that for ethylene insertion. Chain transfer between transition metal complexes and main group element alkyls plays a crucial role in olefin polymerization [51–53]. A related transformation that utilizes C–H activation by σ-bond metathesis is the hydromethylation of propene, as reported by Sadow and Tilley in 2003 [54]. The mechanism of chain exchange between V and Al is formally a transmethylation reaction. Alkyl-group migration from active sites to co-catalysts, such as MAO or DEAC, can be used to tune molecular weight and end-groups of polyolefin [55]. In coordination polymerization, chain transfer offers the possibility to influence the number of chain produced by catalytic site and the property of polyethylene [56]. In this part, n-butyl group was chosen to represent the growing polyethylene chain due to its substantial steric hindrance. The mechanism of chain exchange is depicted in Fig. 9 , which may result in rapid deactivation in the kinetic profiles. Halogen atom interacts with adjacent metal centers to induce the chain exchange, which prohibits further ethylene insertion due to strong coordination capability of the halogen atom. As shown in Fig. 10 , chain transfer mechanism is essentially controlled by thermodynamics of the dissociation of the heterobimetallic complex. Both routes are likely to occur during polymerization process [57]. All the relative Gibbs free energies computed using the B3LYP M06, M06L and M062X functionals are summarized in Table S6 in the Supporting Information. The β-H agostic interaction with the vanadium center is of crucial importance for chain termination. The activation energy for chain terminations is 8.1 kcal mol−1 with alkyl group beside and 8.4 kcal mol−1 with halogen atom beside, respectively (Fig. 10). Both of these two routes are likely to occur and the difference between two products may result from the electronic effect of halogen atom. Existence of halogen atom makes the product more stable and blocks the insertion of ethylene or alkyl group, which may lead to a deactivation in the kinetic curve. As depicted in Fig. 11 , D2 shows longer distance of V···C6 2.574 Å versus 2.453 Å of V···C8, indicating that the participation of halogen atoms favors the chain termination due to the longer distance between vanadium atom and polyethylene chain during polymerization. 4 Conclusion Polyethylene catalysts were prepared using vanadocene supported on industrial silica. The kinetic investigation of ethylene polymerization by supported vanadocene catalyst in the presence of aluminum diethyl monochloride (DEAC) or triisobutylaluminum (TIBA) as chain transfer agent allowed us to investigate the effects of co-catalyst on ethylene polymerization. Low polymerization temperature and few amounts of co-catalysts are beneficial to this supported vanadocene polyethylene catalyst. The Al/V ratio and kinds of co-catalysts not only demonstrated the efficiency of co-catalysts but also revealed the influence of halogen atom. Furthermore, the match between experiments and DFT computations supports the overall mechanism of deactivation. The calculations using a model (Model 2) with silicon hydroxyl group showed that the initiation, propagation and chain transfer have higher activation barriers as compared to the standard supported Model 1. The co-catalysts have ability to participate polymerization reaction where the monomer insertion, chain propagation and chain exchange take place. This work provides a basic understanding on the effects of co-catalyst on ethylene polymerization over supported vanadocene catalyst, and sheds some light on the development of novel polyethylene catalysts.

        "dc:description": "In this work, fundamental insight into the multifaceted role of co-catalyst in activation, propagation, and chain exchange of vanadocene in the immobilized single-site olefin polymerization catalyst has been obtained. The kinetics were followed for various Al/V ratios, at the same polymerization temperature with aluminium diethyl monochloride (DEAC) or triisobutylaluminium (TIBA) as co-catalyst. The results put forward a plausible deactivation reaction path of the catalyst for aluminium diethyl monochloride (DEAC) with irregular morphology of polyethylene particle due to the interaction between halogen atom and vanadium atom. This experimental set of data is supported by a computational investigation at the DFT level that rationalizes specific effects in the presence of co-catalyst at the molecular scale. This joint investigation offers a basic understanding for further catalyst developments in the field of supported metallocene catalyst for olefin polymerization.",
