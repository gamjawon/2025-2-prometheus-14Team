To investigate the cooperative effect of binuclear metallocene catalysts in olefin polymerization, a series of Si-(CH₂)ₙ-Si bridged binuclear indene pyrrolidine titanium catalysts 2d-7d (Ti2) were synthesized. The mononuclear complex NC₄H₈CpC₆H₄(Me)₂SiN(CH₃)₃TiCl2 (Ti1) was also prepared for control experiments. DFT calculations show that increasing the methylene spacer length (n=2–7) simultaneously enlarges the Ti-Ti distance (8.93–14.65 Å) and reduces the buried volume (%Vbur=16.2–12.4 %). In the presence of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] as a co-catalyst, 2d-7d (Ti2) showed higher activity and thermal stability. For ethylene/1-octene copolymers, especially 5d (Ti2) at 120 °C, the activity was 2.65×107 g/(mol·h), the Mw was 66.93×104 g/mol, and the 1-octene insertion rate was 8.4 mol%, which were 1.8 times, 1.9 times, and 1.3 times higher than that of mononuclear 1d (Ti1), respectively. Copolymers from binuclear catalysts showed reduced crystallinity and melting points due to enhanced branching, alongside improved tensile strength and elastic recovery.

With the continuous improvement of market demands, higher requirements have been put forward for the performance and application of polyolefin materials [5,6]. Catalyst technology is the key technology in the olefin polymerization process, and it directly determines the structure and properties of the polymer [7–13]. Therefore, the development of molecular catalysts has been continuously evolving in the past two decades. In particular, the single-site catalytic system of Group (IV) metal complexes for olefin polymerization has been well established, providing customized polymer properties, especially molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and high catalytic activity [14–17]. The discovery of metallocene catalysts is an important milestone in the research of olefin polymerization catalysts [18]. One of the most exciting advances is the discovery of single active site metallocene compounds and their coordination complexes. The invention of these olefin polymerization catalysts and the increasing maturity of new polymerization technologies have led to the rapid development of the polyolefin industry [19–21]. Influenced by the synergistic effect of many active centres of biological enzymes, that offer excellent activity, polyolefin catalysts are also developed and used to obtain high catalytic performance [22,23]. For example, Noh et al. pioneered the study of methylene-bridged binuclear catalysts (Zr-based) and revealed the critical role of spacer length in ethylene polymerization [24]. Marks et al. further established the framework for understanding bimetallic cooperativity, demonstrating how linked centers enhance copolymerization selectivity [25]. In this regard, many binuclear and multinuclear catalysts have been developed and scrutinized for olefin polymerization to get excellent performance. The binuclear metallocene catalysts possess two metal active centres that produce different polymerization effects as compared to mononuclear systems. The two active centres may closely cooperate and influence each other to achieve high activity and selectivity in olefin polymerization. Furthermore, the different environments of organic frameworks around the metal centre, the distance between metal active centres, and types of cocatalysts can significantly change the polymerization activity, molecular weight, and branching structure of polyolefins [26,27]. Due to their excellent polymerization effects, multinuclear catalysts have become a research hotspot for scientists. In this study, a series of binuclear titanium catalysts of type [NC4H8CpC6H4MeSiN(CH3)3TiCl2]2(CH2)n (where n=2–7 for the corresponding 2d-7d complexes) were developed and scrutinized for ethylene/1-octene copolymerization. For comparison purposes, the mononuclear indenyl titanium catalyst of type NC4H8CpC6H4(Me)2SiN(CH3)3TiCl2 was also prepared and evaluated for ethylene/1-octene copolymerization. The relationship between the synergistic effect of the binuclear metallocene catalyst and the distance between the two metal centres, as well as the influence of the synergistic effect on the structure and properties of the ethylene/1-octene copolymerization product, were investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 General materials All processes are carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere, using standard Schlenk technology or a glove box filled with pure nitrogen. The ethylene gas passes through a deoxygenation tower before entering the reactor. After deoxygenation, the ethylene gas is 99.99999 % pure. Toluene and hexane are purified by dry nitrogen purging followed by passing through an activated alumina column. 1-octene was purchased from Beijing Bailing Wei. Borane [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. triisobutylaluminum (TIBA 1.0 mol/L hexane solution) was purchased from McLean Shanghai. All other chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification unless otherwise stated. 2.2 Synthesis of metallocene complexes The synthetic routes are shown in Fig. 1 . Mononuclear metallocene complex (1d) was synthesized according to the method reported in the previous literature [28]. Synthesis of Binuclear Metallocene Complex (2d was taken as an example): Under an inert atmosphere, 30 mL of diethyl ether and 1-(1-H-3-indenyl)pyrrolidinyl lithium 573 mg (3.00 mmol) were added to a 100 mL reaction flask, the flask was cooled to −10 °C, and the mixture was slowly added dropwise with bis(dichloromethylmethylsilyl) series compounds (1.0 eq). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h to give 2b Under an inert atmosphere, a 50 mL reaction flask was charged with 1.10 g (2.00 mmol, n=2) of intermediate 2b with 20 mL of diethyl ether. The reaction flask was then cooled to 0 °C temperature and then slowly treated with 380 mg (4.80 mmol) of white lithium tert‑butylamide solid. The mixture was stirred for 3 h at room temperature and subsequently filtered to get 2c. The product 2c was then treated with 4.00 mL (4.2 eq) of n-butyllithium solution (2.4 M in n-hexane) and continuously stirred for 2 h at room temperature to get a yellow precipitate. The product was filtered and washed with n-hexane (3 times) to obtain a yellow lithium salt (572 mg, 39 % yield) after drying. To the THF (20 mL) solution of yellow lithium salt (570 mg, 0.88 mmol), slowly added TiCl3(THF)3 powder (714 mg, 1.93 mmol) and stirred for 1 h. Subsequently, treated with lead dichloride (270 mg, 0.97 mmol) and stirred for 3 h. The THF was removed under reduced pressure and the product was extracted with toluene. The white chloride precipitate and elemental lead were filtered to get a black solution. This solution was vacuum dried and washed with n-hexane (3×10 mL) to obtain a black metallocene compound 2d (612 mg) in 80.8 % yield. 1H NMR (400 MHz, C6D6): δ 7.67 (d, J = 38.1 Hz, 4H), 7.03 (d, J = 29.7 Hz, 4H), 5.79 (d, J = 22.9 Hz, 2H), 3.63 (d, J = 55.1 Hz, 6H), 3.13 (s, 2H), 1.45 (d, J = 4.6 Hz, 18H), 1.24 (s, 12H), 0.78 (d, J = 10.8 Hz, 4H), 0.68 (d, J = 12.5 Hz, 2H) ppm. 13C NMR (101 MHz, C6D6): δ 149.58, 142.21, 135.29, 126.31, 125.56, 121.54, 121.31, 92.13, 60.86, 50.40, 42.13, 32.95, 25.68, 25.43, 18.90, 1.99 ppm. When n=3, 4, 5, 6, 7, the corresponding binuclear metallocene catalysts are named 3d, 4d, 5d, 6d, and 7d with reference information in the appendix. 2.3 Ethylene/1-octene copolymerization In the ethylene/1-octene copolymerization reaction, a 100 mL reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer was evacuated at 150 °C for 30 min. Then, 20 mL of anhydrous n-hexane and 7.13 mL of 1-octene were added to the reactor under a nitrogen atmosphere. Once the reaction system reached thermal equilibrium at the desired reaction temperature, the triisobutylaluminum TIBA (1.5 mL, 100 µmol/mL in hexane), catalyst (1.0 mL, 1 µmol/mL in toluene), and cocatalyst (1.0 mL, 1.1 µmol/mL in toluene) were subsequently added to the reaction system. After allowing the reaction to proceed for 10 min, the copolymerization reaction was terminated by adding acidic ethanol. The precipitated product was separated, washed several times with ethanol, and then dried under vacuum at 140 °C. 3 Results and discussion In olefin polymerization reaction, the reaction temperature is one of the key factors affecting the performance of the catalyst, and its regulatory role on the catalyst activity and product characteristics is crucial. Therefore, the binuclear 4d catalyst precatalyst was the first to be evaluated for ethylene/1-octene copolymerization at different reaction temperatures. In the presence of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] as a cocatalyst, the effect of the polymerization temperature (90–160 °C) on the catalytic performance was studied and compared with that of the mononuclear 1d catalyst precatalyst. All reactions were carried out under 20 atmospheres of ethylene, and the polymerization data are shown in Table 1 . We found that the polymerization temperature has a significant impact on the activity and product properties (molecular weight and molecular weight distribution). At 90 °C, the polymerization activity of the binuclear 4d catalyst is as high as 1.23×10⁷ g/(mol·h), and it is worth noting that the molecular weight (Mw) of the obtained polymer reaches 104.37×10⁴ g/mol, which is much higher than that of the mononuclear catalytic system (entry 5 vs entry 1, Table 1). For the binuclear catalyst, the activity gradually decreases as the polymerization temperature increases from 90 °C to 160 °C, but an activity as high as 0.91×10⁷ g/(mol·h) is still observed at 160 °C (entry 8, Table 1). In contrast, the activity of the mononuclear 1d catalyst shows an obvious decreasing trend, with the activity decreasing from 0.55×10⁷ g/(mol·h) to 0.12×10⁷ g/(mol·h) (entry 1 vs entry 4, Table 1). In addition, from the perspective of molecular weight distribution, the copolymer molecular weight distribution obtained from the mononuclear 1d catalyst is significantly wider than that obtained from the binuclear 4d catalyst system (entries 1–4 vs entries 5–8, Table 1), indicating that the mononuclear 1d catalyst is more prone to partial decomposition at higher temperatures. These results indicated that the newly developed binuclear 4d catalyst has excellent thermal stability and can be used for high-temperature solution olefin polymerization. In terms of synergistic cooperativity, the binuclear 4d catalyst shows higher thermal stability and catalytic activity than the mononuclear 1d catalyst under the same conditions. In particular, at 160 °C, the activity and relative molecular weight of the binuclear 4d catalyst are 7.6 times and 1.5 times higher than those obtained from the mononuclear 1d catalyst, respectively (entry 8 vs entry 4, Table 1). The molecular weights of the polymers were measured, and it was found that for both catalysts, the weight-average molecular weight and number-average molecular weight of the polymers decreased with increasing temperature. This is due to the acceleration of the β-H elimination reaction of the polymer alkyl titanium at higher temperatures, which causes the polymer to detach from the titanium active centre and hinders the further insertion of olefins for chain growth. The densities of all polymers were tested, and it was found that the density of the polymers did not change much for both the catalytic systems, with a density of about 0.88 g/cm³. Through the above experimental results and comparisons, under the same conditions, the binuclear 4d catalyst exhibits higher polymerization activity, higher molecular weight, narrower molecular weight distribution, and better high-temperature resistance than the mononuclear 1d catalyst. For ethylene/1-octene polyolefin elastomer (POE) copolymer materials, the content of 1-octene in POE is a key indicator, which directly affects the performance of POE products. The concentration of 1-octene in the polymerization system may not only influence the copolymerization performance of the catalyst but also control the incorporation of 1-octene in POE products. Generally, under the premise of the same catalyst, a higher concentration of 1-octene is conducive to increasing the 1-octene insertion rate in POE products. However, when 1-octene reaches a certain limiting concentration, any further increase of the 1-octene concentration cannot effectively increase the content of 1-octene in POE products. At the same time, it will increase the energy consumption for the recovery of 1-octene. Because of this reason, the effect of different concentrations of 1-octene on the polymerization reaction was investigated, and the experimental results obtained are shown in Table 2 . The experimental results indicated that the catalytic activity of copolymerization may decrease as the 1-octene concentration increases. It is theoretically possible to enhance the activity of the catalyst within a certain range of 1-octene concentration due to the comonomer effect [29]. The incorporation of 1-octene into copolymer may promote the long branches of the polymer main chain, which in turn enhances the solubility of the intermediates of the active species. This allows the active centre to stay for a longer time in the polymerization system, thereby enhancing the polymerization activity. On the other hand, if the concentration of 1-octene increases from the optimum level, the double bond of 1-octene may compete with ethylene for coordination at the catalyst active site, limit the insertion of ethylene, and consequently reduce the polymerization activity. The experimental results showed that the binuclear 4d catalyst may produce ethylene/1-octene copolymer with a density of 0.885 g/cm³ at 0.5 M concentration of 1-octene, while the mononuclear 1d catalyst require 1.5 M concentration of 1-octene to achieve a copolymer with same density value (entry 6 vs. entry 3, Table 2). The binuclear 4d catalyst consistently exhibited higher 1-octene conversion rates (e.g., 27.2 % at 0.5 M) compared to mononuclear 1d catalyst (15.4 %, Table 2), further supporting its enhanced ability to incorporate bulky comonomers. This trend is consistent with the NMR-measured 1-octene content in the copolymers later (Table 5), confirming the synergistic effect between the dual active centers. These data reflect that the binuclear catalytic system has better copolymerization characteristics than the mononuclear catalytic system. Furthermore, when the concentration of 1-octene increased from 0.5 M to 2.5 M, the molecular weight and density of the polymer slightly decreased. These results demonstrated that high-concentration 1-octene has the potential to moderately enhance the insertion of 1-octene up to a certain limit for the current catalytic system. Additionally, the reduction in polymer molecular weight suggests that high-concentration of 1-octene may impede the coordination insertion of ethylene at the titanium active centre. The relationship and regularity between the metal synergistic effect and the distance of the two titanium metal centres (Ti…Ti) in the binuclear catalysts could be examined by comparing the catalytic activity of these systems, the properties of the resulting polymer produced by these catalysts, and the findings from DFT calculations. Using DFT calculations, the structures of the binuclear 2d-7d catalysts were optimized with a B3LYP/def2-QZVPD basis set, and the solvent correction for n-hexane was calculated by using the SMD solvation model. The corresponding distances between the two Ti centers of the geometric optimized structures of these binuclear catalysts were calculated and analyzed as shown in Table 3 . We found that the Ti…Ti distance increases when the number of methylene groups increases between the silicon atoms, whereas no significant differences were observed in other geometric parameters (bond lengths and angles) of binuclear. Furthermore, the percent buried volume (%Vbur) has also been calculated (Fig.2 ), based on SambVca 2.1 tool, to study the steric properties of the ligands [30,31]. The %Vbur values obtained are presented in Table 3 and show a decreasing trend from 16.2 % to 12.4 % as the methylene chain length increases from 2 to 7, indicating an increasing surface area for interaction with the substrate. The reason for this may be that the longer -(CH₂)ₙ-chain allows the ligand framework to adopt a more extended conformation, thus somewhat reducing the steric congestion around the titanium center. These results demonstrated that the methylene linkage is an important factor in tuning the metal-metal cooperation effect and thus catalytic activity. Table 4 shows the role of carbon linkage in tuning the catalytic activity of binuclear 2d-7d catalysts. These results demonstrated that as the number of methylene in the carbon linkage increases, the polymerization activity of the binuclear catalyst first increases and then decreases. The highest catalytic activity of 2.65×10⁷ g/(mol·h) and the highest molecular weight of 66.93×104 g/mol of polymer can be obtained by the binuclear 5d catalyst which has 5 methylene groups in the carbon linkage. The highest catalytic activity of the catalyst 5d is 1.8 times higher than the activity obtained from the mononuclear 1d catalyst (entry 5 vs entry 1, Table 4). This highest performance could be attributed to the effective synergism of the two Ti atoms of the binuclear 5d catalyst. The melting temperature and crystallinity of the polymers produced by the binuclear metallocene catalysts are generally lower than those of the polymers obtained with the mononuclear metallocene catalyst. This phenomenon can be attributed to the incorporation of the 1-octene monomer and the increased number of branches in the copolymer molecular chain, which leads to a reduction in the packing density of the polymer chain. Consequently, the intermolecular forces between the chain segments are weakened which makes it difficult for the polymer to form an ordered crystalline structure during the cooling process, thereby diminishing the crystallization ability of the polymer chain segments and subsequently lowering the melting point exhibited by the DSC curve [32]. Notably, when the number of bridging methylene ranges from 3 to 5, the polymers exhibited low crystallinity, and the copolymerization performance of the catalyst is superior (entries 3–5, Table 4). However, when the number of carbon atoms reaches 6, the crystallinity exhibits an upward trend (entry 6, Table 4). For n≥6, flexible polymethylene spacers may temporarily shorten the Ti-Ti distance by CC rotational bending, and the coordination of the monomer at one Ti center may be interfered with by another Ti center in the same binuclear complex. This in turn leads to lower monomer insertion rate and higher crystallinity. To confirm the content and molecular structure of 1-octene within the polymer, high-temperature 13C NMR analysis was carried out for the two polymer samples obtained from entries 1 and 5 of Table 4. These results are illustrated in Fig. 3 , where the signal peaks are assigned to carbons in the copolymer [33]. The content of 1-octene in the copolymer was determined by integrating the areas of each signal peak in the quantitative carbon spectrum [34], as detailed in Table 5 . The outcomes reveal that both the polymer samples exhibited identical peak shapes and chemical shifts, demonstrating that the molecular structures of both these two polymers are analogous. Specifically, the principal chemical shift peaks are as follows: 38.08 ppm, corresponding to the absorption peak of the ethylene-1-octene-ethylene (EOE) segment; 34.45 ppm and 27.21 ppm, corresponding to the absorption peaks of the 1-octene-ethylene-1-octene (OEO) segment, respectively. These results validate the presence of 1-octene in the copolymer chain and imply that the composition of the polymer chain is variegated. Table 5 lists the monomer insertion and the content of different sequences as well as the competitive polymerization rates of ethylene and octene for the catalyst 1d and 5d synthesized copolymers. From the competitive polymerization rate, the ro of the binuclear 5d catalytic system is higher than that of the mononuclear 1d catalyst, which, to some extent, indicates that binuclear 5d catalyst has better copolymerization properties. From the distribution data of 1-octene, it is anticipated that the occurrence frequencies of 1-octene-rich sequences (such as OEO, OOE, OOO, etc.) are relatively low, suggesting that the 1-octene molecules are predominantly segregated by ethylene segments within the polymer chain and are uniformly dispersed in the copolymer segments. This uniform dispersion characteristic may exert a significant influence on the physical properties of the polymer, and the evenly distributed 1-octene contributes to enhancing the overall performance of the material. From the information depicted in Fig. 3, the polymer generated under the influence of the mononuclear catalyst exhibits an evident OOE ternary segment at 35.8 ppm in comparison to the polymer obtained with the binuclear catalyst. However, it is noteworthy that the calculated 1-octene incorporation amount in the sample obtained from the mononuclear 1d catalyst is 6.6 mol% (entry 1, Table 5), whereas in the polymer obtained from the binuclear 5d catalyst is 8.4 mol% (entry 2, Table 5). Compared to its mononuclear counterpart, the binuclear metallocene 5d catalyst exhibits 1.8 times higher copolymerization activity and more uniform 1-octene incorporation (8.4 mol%), due to the cooperative activation of monomers by dual Ti centers. This disparity indicates that the binuclear metallocene catalyst exhibited more outstanding performance throughout the polymerization reaction process. It possesses higher efficiency in promoting the insertion and incorporation of monomers into the polymer chain, thereby providing complexity and diversity to the polymer. The mechanical properties of the synthesized samples were evaluated via uniaxial tensile tests, with the tensile rate set at 100 mm/min and the corresponding strain rate at 200 %/min (Table 6 ). As clearly shown in the engineering stress-strain curves (Fig. 4 ), in comparison to the polymer sample obtained from mononuclear 1d catalyst, the polymer samples obtained from binuclear 2d-7d catalysts exhibited significant improvements in the tensile properties, the elongation was markedly superior to the copolymer obtained from mononuclear catalyst system. The underlying reason is that the binuclear catalysts exhibit a stronger ability to incorporate bulky comonomers, leading to more long-chain branches (LCB) in the copolymer. This synergy between active centers enhances comonomer insertion while suppressing chain transfer, ultimately improving tensile deformation properties. This benefited from the evident comonomer synergistic effect in the binuclear catalyst system, where its nearly amorphous main chain structure could withstand longer-term tensile forces. Moreover, since the long-chain branches are crystallizable, the combined effect of main chain crystallization and side chain hard segments led to a high polymer crystallinity. However, the incorporation of 1-octene in the main chain of P1 was relatively low, which resulted in its tensile strength being higher than that of the copolymer under the binuclear catalyst. To further investigate the elastic recovery behavior of the samples, hysteresis experiments were conducted at 300 % strain (Table 6). By comparing the tensile and elastic recovery properties of the polymer samples obtained from the mononuclear and binuclear catalysts, some interesting phenomena were observed. All samples underwent significant deformation after the first loading cycle. However, no obvious changes were observed in the subsequent loading cycles, and the hysteresis loops after the second cycle were almost identical. In terms of the evolution of strain recovery with the number of loading cycles, all samples exhibited stable elasticity as the loading cycles increased. In particular, the binuclear copolymer had a more pronounced strain recovery advantage, decreasing from approximately 150 % after the first cycle to 175 % after ten cycles, while the first tensile recovery of the copolymer obtained from the mononuclear catalyst could only reach 175 %, and the first tensile recovery of the copolymer under the binuclear catalyst was superior to that of the mononuclear one. In addition, the polymers of the binuclear catalyst also exhibited good tensile strength, and its strength level indicated that the binuclear catalyst could promote more effective cross-linking of polymer chains and strengthen the intermolecular interactions. 4 Conclusions Bimetallic synergy in Si-(CH₂)ₙ-Si-bridged binuclear indenyl-pyrrolidinyl titanium catalyst (2–7d) were successfully synthesized and characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR. The molecular structures of the binuclear catalyst were simulated using DFT calculations, which showed that the metal-to-metal distance increased as the number of methylene groups between the silicon atoms increased. Under the same conditions, the catalytic performance of binuclear 2d-7d catalyst in the copolymerization of ethylene/1-octene was superior to that of mononuclear 1d catalyst, showing a significant synergistic effect in terms of activity, Mw, and the copolymerization of 1-octene monomer. Specifically, the binuclear 5d catalyst, which has 5 methylene groups in the carbon linkage, showed high catalytic activity of 2.65×10⁷ g/(mol·h) and offered a copolymer with high Mw of 66.93×10⁴ g/mol, containing 8.4 mol% of high 1-octene content. This Mw and 1-octene content is 1.9 times and 1.3 times higher than the polymer obtained from the mononuclear 1d catalyst, respectively. Furthermore, the copolymer obtained from the binuclear systems exhibited improved tensile properties with enhanced elastic recovery and increased tensile strength. These results showed that in comparison to the mononuclear 1d catalyst, the binuclear 2d-7d catalyst exhibited a significant metal-metal synergistic effect during the ethylene/1-octene copolymerization reaction.

        "dc:description": "To investigate the cooperative effect of binuclear metallocene catalysts in olefin polymerization, a series of Si-(CH₂)ₙ-Si bridged binuclear indene pyrrolidine titanium catalysts 2d-7d (Ti2) were synthesized. The mononuclear complex NC₄H₈CpC₆H₄(Me)₂SiN(CH₃)₃TiCl2 (Ti1) was also prepared for control experiments. DFT calculations show that increasing the methylene spacer length (n=2–7) simultaneously enlarges the Ti-Ti distance (8.93–14.65 Å) and reduces the buried volume (%Vbur=16.2–12.4 %). In the presence of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] as a co-catalyst, 2d-7d (Ti2) showed higher activity and thermal stability. For ethylene/1-octene copolymers, especially 5d (Ti2) at 120 °C, the activity was 2.65×107 g/(mol·h), the Mw was 66.93×104 g/mol, and the 1-octene insertion rate was 8.4 mol%, which were 1.8 times, 1.9 times, and 1.3 times higher than that of mononuclear 1d (Ti1), respectively. Copolymers from binuclear catalysts showed reduced crystallinity and melting points due to enhanced branching, alongside improved tensile strength and elastic recovery.",
