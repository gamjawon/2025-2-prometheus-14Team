(Received March 31, 1990; revised June 6, 1990) Abstract Silica-supported manganese-promoted rhodium catalysts previously observed to contain a form of adsorbed CO assigned to a tilted Rh C 0 Mn species show a higher specific activity for the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide than do unpromoted samples. This enhanced activity manifests itself primarily through increased formation of Ca+ products. The activation energy for chain growth was significantly higher on the promoted sample. These observations suggest that the promoted catalyst presumably provides a greater number of active sites, and that the insertion mechanism may be altered as compared to the unpromoted material. No direct evidence exists for the participation of the tilted species in the CO/hydrogen reaction, although its participation in chain growth is considered possible. Introduction Rhodium supported on oxides of transition metals such as titanium, zirconium, manganese, lanthanum and vanadium or containing oxides of these elements as additives exhibits interesting properties for the catalytic hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (e.g. [1-12]). In particular, Rh Mn catalysts show an increased activity for CO hydrogenation and an increased selectivity for Cg-oxygenates even with very low concentrations of manganese [3, 4, 9, 12]. Recent work has indicated that this promotion effect is due to the presence of support and/or promoter species on the surfaces of the metallic particles [4, 9, 12 16], as found earlier for so-called strong me- tal support interactions (e.g. [17 22]). These support/promoter oxide moie- ties can influence the electronic state of the surface metal atoms and alter metal ensembles, thereby influencing the catalytic properties of even large metal crystallites. Additionally, it has been suggested that these surface oxide *Present address: Mobil Research and Development Corp., Central Research Laboratory, Princeton, NJ 08540 U.SA. \"Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 202 species can act as Lewis acids and alter the catalytic process via coordination of chemisorbed CO at the oxygen end [23-30], a process proposed earlier for related systems [31-34]. This coordination could weaJken the C 0 bond, facilitating dissociation (e.g. [23, 26]), or it might enhance the rate of CO insertion into metal-alkyi bonds (a possible step in the formation of oxygenates from CO and Ha), a process known to occur with, e.g., AlBra and RMn(CO)4 [35, 36]. Recently several workers in this area have observed low-frequency infrared bands that they have attributed to an M C O M' species [37 40]; the frequencies of these bands agreed in general with those for known molecular complexes of metal carbonyls with Lewis adducts [41 ]. For example, Ichikawa and Fukushima [37] reported that the addition of a manganese promoter to Rh/SiOa catalysts shifted the bridge CO band from 1880 cm\"1 to between 1820 and 1700 cm\"1; additionally a weak shoulder appeared at 1520 cm\"! in catalysts with high manganese content. Recently we have reported on the adsorption and reactivity of carbon monoxide on manganese-promoted Rh/SiOg catalysts as studied by room temperature and low-temperature IR spectroscopy [42]. Under the proper conditions some samples displayed an intense IR band near 1715 cm\"1, compatible with frequencies ofM C 0 M' species in known organometallic compounds. Experiments with \"CO showed that this band corresponded to a C 0 vibration, but the absence of bands between 1600 and 1300 cm~1 ruled out the possibility of a surface carbonate. Unlike the spectra of Ichikawa and Fukushima [37], the low-frequency band was well separated from the bridged CO band, demonstrating that it was due to a new species and not simply a down-shifting of the bridge band due to a non-specific Mn influence. Further studies indicated that manganese promotion weakens the strength of the Rh CO bond; reactivity studies indicated that while the M C O M' species is highly reactive toward hydrogen, promotion also increases the reactivity of the linearly bonded species. The coverage of the metallic surface by the manganese oxide overlayer was shown to be dynamic; changes in temperature and gas composition altered the fraction of the rhodium surface available for chemisorption. In the work reported in this paper, three silica-supported rhodium samples whose adsorptive properties have been previously studied by IR have been tested for CO hydrogenation, with the goal of examining how the presence of the unusual IR species reported in the previous paper is reflected in the activity and selectivity of the catalysts for this reaction. Experimental Three catalysts were tested: one unpromoted sample and two promoted materials. RhISiOy. was prepared by the slow impregnation of Aerosil -200 with RhCIa from methanol solution. Following evaporation of the methanol, the 203 sample was calcined in flowing oxygen at 570 K for 7 h. The resulting catalyst contained 4 wt.% rhodium. This sample after reduction in Hg exhibited IR bands due to three distinct CO species [42]: a linear species (2067 cm\"1), a bridged species (1901 cm\" i), and a geminal dicarbonyl species (twin bands at 2092 and 2038 cm-1). RhMn/SiOz was prepared in a two-step procedure. First, Mn(NOg)2 4HaO was impregnated into silica from methanol solution; following drying, the manganese nitrate was decomposed by calcination for 2 h at 480 K in flowing oxygen. RhCIs was then impregnated into this material and the resulting catalyst precursor was calcined for 7 h at 570 K. This material contained by weight 8% manganese and 4% rhodium. Four CO species were observed with IR after reduction in Hg [42] in addition to the linear (2073 cm\"1), bridged (1878 cm~1), and dicarbonyl (2100 and 2038 cm~1) species, a new band, attributed to an M C O M' species, was observed at 1715 cm\"'. Compared to the linear CO on the unpromoted sample, the linear and low- frequency species were less strongly adsorbed and more reactive toward hydrogen. MnRh/SiO^ was prepared by the impregnation of the calcined Rh/SiOg catalyst precursor described above with MnClg from methanol solution. Following drying, the manganese chloride was decomposed by treatment in flowing oxygen at 620 K for 2 h. Although the IR bands of CO adsorbed on this sample after reduction in Hg were ill-defined due to low uptake, all four species observed on the RhMn/SiOg sample were present. However, the intensities of the bridged and low-frequency CO species relative to that of the linear species were much lower for this sample than for the RhMn/SiOa catalyst. Catalytic experiments were performed with procedures and apparatus described elsewhere [43]. An amount of 50 70 mg of powdered catalyst was diluted with quartz beads and placed in a fixed bed glass differential reactor. Prior to catalytic measurements the sample was reduced for 2 h in flowing hydrogen at 623 K. The temperature was then lowered to 523 K and synthesis gas was introduced to the reactor; the reaction was allowed to proceed until steady-state conditions were reached (generally 5 h). During this initial period the activity of all catalysts decreased by 30 to 50%, but no dramatic changes in selectivity were observed. During catalytic measu- rements the total pressure was maintained at 0.1 MPa and an Hg/CO ratio of 2/1 was used; the temperature was varied between 473 and 523 K, and the space velocity was adjusted to maintain CO conversion below 1% (typically 3 cm3 (g cat.)~1 s~1). Product composition was determined by analysis with a gas chromatograph. Results Steady-state activities and selectivities for CO hydrogenation of the three catalysts studied are presented in Table 1 and Figs. 1-3.

On a per-gram basis the unpromoted Rh/SiOa catalyst developed a somewhat lower activity as compared to reported literature data [12, 44]. This may be due to non-optimal catalyst pretreatments. All materials tested 206 in the present study were pretreated under identical conditions which were chosen so that the promoted sample RhMn/SiOg could be expected to form the tilted C- and 0-bonded carbon monoxide species. The rhodium in the Rh/SiOg sample appeared to be present in low dispersion. TEM of Rh/SiOz and MnRh/SiOg after their use in catalytic testing indicated the formation of large particles with a wide particle size range of between 5 and 50 nm. The distribution of rhodium crystallites among the catalyst (support) particles was rather non-uniform and a reasonable estimate of the average particle size cannot be given. In contrast, the TEM results of the RhMn/SiOg sample after catalytic runs indicated the presence of rather uniform rhodium particles having an average diameter of approximately 2 nm. On a per-gram basis, the promoted catalysts were considerably more active than the unpromoted catalyst. Additionally, the manganese-containing catalysts produced a significantly higher proportion of Ca+ compounds; this disparity in heavier products became more pronounced as the temperature was increased (see Fig. 2). The distribution of the C2+ hydrocarbons followed Schultz Flory kinetics for polymerization/condensation processes proceeding with constant rates of propagation and chain rupture (e.g. [45, 46]), as shown in Fig. 3, where chain propagation probabilities (a) estimated from the slopes of the lines drawn through the data are also presented. Significant changes with variations of the space velocity were observed for olefin/parafin ratios, with the olefin production being higher at lower contact times. Significant amounts of ethanol and acetaldehyde were produced by all catalysts; selectivity to these compounds was highest for the RhMn/SiOg catalyst, as indicated in Table 1. Acetaldehyde seems to be the primary product, since the acetaldehyde vs. ethanol ratio increases with decreasing contact times. This ratio followed the same trend as the ethene vs. ethane ratio, i.e. it decreased in the order MnRh/SiOa > Rh/SiOg > RhMn/SiOg. Due to the low pressure, only trace amounts of methanol were observed for any catalyst. Meaningful methanol vs. Ca+ oxygenate ratios can therefore not be reported. Discussion As shown by previously reported IR spectra [42], the state of the metallic surface on the promoted catalysts is significantly different from that of the unpromoted Rh/SiOg sample. The appearance of the intense low-frequency CO band near 1715 cm\"1 indicates that some significant fraction of the surface Rh atoms are in close proximity to manganese cations. Because of the dynamic relationship between the metallic surface and the manganese oxide overlayers, this fraction varies with the history and temperature of the sample as well as with the composition of the contacting gas. Immediately after reduction in hydrogen, the manganese oxide overlayer appears to cover virtually all of the rhodium surface. However, contact with CO at temperatures of 200 K and above disrupts Mn O Rh bonds and partially reconstructs the oxide overlayer, exposing metallic rhodium. 207 Although the exact fraction of the rhodium surface that is exposed and the relative number of Rh/Mn interfacial sites under CO hydrogenation conditions are not known, it is clear that the presence of the promoter species has important consequences for catalytic activity and selectivity. A rough estimate of the relative exposed rhodium metal surface areas can be obtained from the relative intensities of CO absorption bands measured when CO adsorption has reached saturation. Relevant data are available from our earlier paper [42]. It may be inferred that Rh/SiOg and RhMn/SiOg expose comparable metal surface areas despite their rather different metal particle sizes. This can only be accounted for by assuming that MnOa; species are blocking a significant percentage of the rhodium particle surface. Such blocking effects have recently been reported for silica-supported rhodium promoted by TiO^ and NbOa. [47]. Based on CO IR band intensities, the MnRh/SiOa sample should expose an accessible metal surface area significantly lower than the other two samples, which is again an indication of blocking of metal surface area by MnOa;, the extent of which obviously depends on catalyst preparation parameters. When accounting for the relative exposed metal areas, comparison of the total rates of CO hydrogenation, as given in Table 1 on a per-gram basis, clearly suggest that the corresponding rates per unit metal surface area should be significantly greater for the promoted than for the unpromoted material; this conclusion can be drawn even though the rates per unit metal surface area cannot be quantitatively calculated from the available data. Additionally, the promoted samples produce a far greater amount of C2+ hydrocarbons than does the unpromoted catalyst (see Fig. 2 and Table 1). To explain the increased activity of manganese-promoted rhodium ca- talysts for the reaction of CO and Hg, it has previously been proposed that the presence of the promoter increases the amount of hydrogen adsorbed on the metal surface [9]. For the hydrogenation of CO on rhodium, the partial pressure dependence of the rate with respect to CO is generally small or even negative, while that with respect to Hg is usually first order or greater (e.g. [3]), indicating that the concentration of hydrogen on the working surface of the catalyst is low. Our data are consistent with this hypothesis insofar as IR studies showed CO to be less strongly bound and much more reactive toward hydrogen on the promoted samples [42], suggesting an increase in the hydrogenative ability of the catalysts. However, an increase in hydrogen concentration and/or hydrogenation capacity alone cannot explain the catalytic data, since the increase in selectivity to higher hydrocarbons suggests a decrease in the rate of hydrogenation relative to that of CH;r insertion. If the rate of hydrogenation is indeed increased by manganese promotion, the rate of chain growth must also be enhanced by a correspondingly larger amount to explain the observed selectivity. At present it is widely accepted that higher hydrocarbons are produced by the insertion of CH;r species into hydrocarbon chains that grow on specific surface sites and desorb as a-olefins via JS-hydrogen abstraction (e.g. [48 50]). This suggestion that a-olefins are the primary products is consistent with 208 the observation that the ethylene/ethane ratio increases with increasing space velocity, as seen in Table 1. Thus the increased selectivity of the promoted catalysts for higher hydrocarbons can be interpreted in terms of an increase in the rate of insertion of CHa. species relative to the rate of their hydrogenation to methane as well as an increase in the rate of insertion of CHr species (vi) relative to the rate of chain termination (Vr). The magnitude of this increase is approximately two-fold, as can be calculated from the data in Fig. 3, given that a=(Vi/(Vi+Ur)). It is interesting to note that although methanation proceeds with the same activation energy on all catalysts, the activation energy for the formation of heavier products is substantially higher for the promoted catalysts. It is logical to suggest that methanation proceeds in a similar manner on all catalysts, but that the mechanism of chain growth is different on the promoted and unpromoted catalysts. Additionally it appears that there are more active sites for chain growth on the Mn-containing catalysts, since they form C2+ products at a much higher rate in spite of their higher activation energy. The selectivity to oxygenated products is not greatly enhanced by the presence of manganese; for the catalysts with the same particle size, Rh/ SiOg and MnRh/SiOa, the amount of oxygenated products produced is virtually the same. These selectivities are similar to those observed under similar conditions by Ichikawa [2], but are much lower than the 60 to 80% ethanol selectivity found by Ponec and co-workers [11, 12] for some of their Mn- and V-promoted Rh catalysts. Given our incomplete understanding of the mechanism of the hydro- genation of carbon monoxide on metal surfaces, it is impossible to directly relate the enhanced activity of the promoted catalysts to the presence of the intense IR band observed at 1715 cm\"1 and attributed to a tilted Rh C 0 Mn species. If the function of this promoter site was to facilitate insertion of molecular CO into an Rh C bond, as suggested earlier, a greater effect on the selectivity to oxygenated products would be expected. If the large increase in the insertion rate observed is attributed to the presence of the tilted species, it seems that the insertion must proceed with the simultaneous breaking of the carbon oxygen bond. Such a step could be imagined to have the significantly higher activation energy measured, with the greatly increased number of sites due to the presence of the manganese species on the surface providing the overall rate enhancement. Methanation would continue on the areas of the metal surface not in proximity to a promoter cation, just as on the clean metal surface of the unpromoted catalyst. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that other explanations for the increase in the activity for C^+ products are possible; large variations in chain growth can be observed for a variety of reasons, e.g. simple differences in particle size [51 53]. One remaining point should be mentioned; other authors have charac- terized promoted metal samples with IR spectroscopy without finding low- frequency CO species, even though high catalytic activities and unusual selectivities were observed (e.g. [11, 12]). It could be argued that the tilted 209 species we observed cannot be responsible for the changes in catalytic behavior since they were not observed on these other samples. Our IR experience suggests, however, that observation of these low-frequency species is not straightforward, and an investigation not specifically seeking such bands could easily overlook them. Because promotion involves trading metal surface area, and hence spectroscopic intensity, for interfacial sites, there is an optimal degree of coverage for the observation of these low-frequency species; conditions must be adjusted carefully for them to be readily apparent. Conclusions In spite of the IR evidence demonstrating the presence of the new, presumably tilted, CO adsorption state on the promoted catalysts, no evidence yet conclusively links the presence of this adsorbed species to the altered activity and selectivity of these materials. It is clear from the IR data that promotion increases the reactivity of adsorbed CO toward hydrogen, but because this increase is shared by both the tilted and linear CO species [42], it is difficult to attribute this effect to a higher dissociation rate for the former. Instead, this seems to signal an increased hydrogenative ability, which can explain the increased activity but not the altered selectivity of the promoted samples. The catalytic data indicate that promotion enhances chain growth and probably alters its mechanism, but a lack of change in selectivity for oxygenated products suggests that direct CO insertion aided by Mn cations is probably not responsible; perhaps instead promoter-assisted in- sertion occurs with simultaneous breaking of the C 0 bond. In any case it seems likely that promotion alters the nature of the metal surface not by one single effect, but through a subtle combination of effects, perhaps including changes in coverage, dissociation, mechanism, and surface geometry and electronics.

Silica-supported manganese-promoted rhodium catalysts previously observed to contain a form of adsorbed CO assigned to a tilted Rh-C-O-Mn species show a higher specific activity for the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide than do unpromoted samples. This enhanced activity manifests itself primarily through increased formation of C2+ products. The activation energy for chain growth was significantly higher on the promoted sample. These observations suggest that the promoted catalyst presumably provides a greater number of active sites, and that the insertion mechanism may be altered as compared to the unpromoted material. No direct evidence exists for the participation of the tilted species in the CO/hydrogen reaction, although its participation in chain growth is considered possible. References 1 M. Ichikawa J. Chem.
