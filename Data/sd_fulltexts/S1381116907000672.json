Graphical abstract Rare earth metal sandwiched Keggin-type heteropolyoxometalates, K11[RE(PW11O39)2] (RE=La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Dy and Y), were immobilized onto aminosilylated mesoporous silica SBA-15. The samples show higher catalytic efficiency than the bulk ones in heterogeneous epoxidation of cyclohexene with H2O2. The leaching of active species is negligible and the recycled catalysts retain high activity. Rare earth metal sandwiched Keggin-type heteropolyoxometalates, K11[RE(PW11O39)2] (RE–PW11, RE=La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Dy and Y), were anchored onto aminosilylated mesoporous silica SBA-15 and the resulting RE–PW11/APTS/SBA-15 materials were characterized by ICP, FT-IR, XRD, N2 adsorption, 31P MAS NMR and TEM. The RE–PW11 clusters preserve their structure in the surface-modified mesopores. The catalytic activity of RE–PW11 clusters was tested on heterogeneous oxidation of cyclohexene by H2O2. The interaction between RE–PW11 and amino groups grafted on the channel surface of SBA-15 leads to strong immobilization of RE–PW11 due to the introduction of the rare earth metal centre, which is against the leaching during the reaction.

Hydrogen peroxide is an attractive oxidant, because it is inexpensive, environmentally clean, and easy to handle. Catalysts such as Ti-containing molecular sieves and polyoxometalates (POM) have been reported to exhibit high activity. In both heterogeneous and homogeneous systems, the oxidation of organic compounds with hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by POMs has been reported by many researchers [1–6]. Among the catalysts used, 12-phosphotungstic acid, H3PW12O40·nH2O is most extensively studied [7–15]. However, the application of POM catalysts still suffers from some drawbacks of the POM nature, particularly the low surface area (<5m2 g−1) leading to the low efficiency and the high solubility causing recycling difficulty and environmental problem. The heterogenization of POM catalysts is an ideal way to solve the above problems. It is well accepted that by converting a homogeneous catalyst into a heterogeneous entity one may combine the activity and selectivity of the homogeneous catalyst with the ease of solid–liquid separation. Some promising heterogeneous POM systems such as insoluble polyoxotungstates [16,17], silica supported peroxotungstates [18,19], triphasic phosphotungstate [20] and phase transfer systems [21] have been reported recently. Previous studies of polyoxometalates supported on amorphous silica or mesoporous silica were mainly focused on the free acids of Keggin-type POMs supported on silica by the incipient wetness method [22–25]. For this preparation method the leaching of POM is rather significant. In some recent contributions, the anchoring of POM free-acids onto the amine groups modified silica surface aimed to minimize leaching of the cluster in washing or during the reaction cycle [6,18]. However, the leaching of polyoxometalate from the supports is still inevitable, which limits the application of these materials in catalysis. Transition metal substituted POMs usually show high activity in the hydroxylation of phenols and their supported catalysts exhibit high resistance to leaching due to the strong interaction between the central transition metal ions and the surface of supports [2,6]. Rare earth metal sandwiched Keggin-type POM anions [RE(PW11O39)2] n− (RE=La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Dy and Y) normally also show catalytic activity in the homogeneous system [26,27]. However, the study of these catalysts in the heterogeneous system is hardly reported. In the present work, the [RE(PW11O39)2] n− clusters have been anchored onto the aminosilylated surface of silica SBA-15 in order to minimize leaching. The obtained materials have been characterized by ICP, FT-IR, N2 adsorption, TEM, XRD and 31P MAS NMR. The results indicate that the POM clusters preserve their structure in the surface-modified mesopores. Their activity of cyclohexene oxidation using H2O2 as oxidant has been studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Rare earth metal nitrates and sulfates were prepared from their corresponding oxides (99.9%). The preparation of K11[RE(PW11O39)2]·nH2O (RE=La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Dy and Y) followed the literature procedures with minor modifications [26,28]. 4.3g dodecatungstophosphoric acid was dissolved in hot water. Concentrated rare earth metal(III) nitrate solution was added to a hot solution with a H3PW12O40:RE(NO3)3 molar ratio of 2:1. Then, concentrated potassium acetate solution (10g of potassium acetate in 10ml of water at pH of 7 adjusted with acetic acid or nitric acid) was added dropwise under vigorous stirring. After potassium acetate solution was completely added, the mixture was kept without stirring for several minutes and filtered. When the filtrate was cooled to 5°C, the desired salt was precipitated completely. The salt was recrystallized from water at least three times and dried in a desiccator over P2O5. SBA-15 was synthesized using the block copolymer Pluronic P123 (Aldrich) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 98%, Aldrich) under acidic condition. After synthesis and removal of the template by calcination at 550°C, the samples were dried at 180°C for 3h under vacuum. The aminosilylation was performed according to the literature method with minor modification. In a typical procedure, 1g of SBA-15 was treated in a 30ml refluxing toluene solution containing 1% γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS) for 5h [29,30]. The resulting material, APTS/SBA-15, was filtered, washed with toluene, and dried at 95°C for 3h to remove the remaining solvent. The K11[RE(PW11O39)2] (denoted as RE–PW11) are immobilized within the modified SBA-15 channels. A typical process is as follows: 2g of APTS/SBA-15 was stirred in a 5ml of aqueous solution containing 6.5×10−4 mol of RE–PW11 at 60°C for 8h. The resulting solid catalysts, RE–PW11/APTS/SBA-15, were then filtered and washed with methanol three times to remove unanchored RE–PW11 and dried at 95°C for 3h. This simple two-step method is illustrated in Scheme 1 . RE–PW11 supported on unmodified SBA-15 are also synthesized through incipient wetness under similar conditions, the resulting materials were denoted by RE–PW11/SBA-15. 2.2 Catalytic reaction Catalytic tests were performed using 8ml tert-butyl alcohol, 2.50ml 30% (24mmol) hydrogen peroxide, 0.838g (10mmol) cyclohexene, 0.150g catalyst and 2ml n-hexane as the internal standard. The reactants were mixed in a round-bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser and allowed to react at 60°C for 4h. After the reaction finished, aliquot was extracted and filtered. The products were analyzed with gas chromatography. 2.3 Characterization Elemental analysis was carried out using a Thermo Elemental IRIS Intrepid ICP-AES. IR spectra were recorded on an AVATAR 360 Fourier transform infrared instrument at room temperature using KBr discs. The specific surface area, pore diameter and pore volume of the samples were determined from N2 adsorption isotherms using a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 apparatus. 31P MAS NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance DSX300 spectrometer. XRD patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 advanced X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with a voltage of 40kV and a current of 40mA. Identification of catalytic products was performed on a Finnigan Voyager GC–MS instrument. Samples were quantified on a GC-122 chromatograph with an Alltech EC-5 capillary column. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of RE–PW11/APTS/SBA-15 ICP elemental analysis was employed to testify the composition of RE–PW11 ligands supported onto the SBA-15 and the results are listed in Table 1 . The PW11:RE molar ratio close to 2:1 is consistent with that of bulk sandwiched RE–PW11. The loads of RE–PW11 are in the range of ca. 30–34%. Similar RE–PW11 loadings indicate that they are similar in electrostatic interaction between different POM clusters and amine groups. IR spectroscopy was used to determine the presence of the POM cluster on silica surfaces. Peak assignments are based on the literature values [31]. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), the characteristic infrared fingerprints of pure Y–PW11 and Y–PW11/APTS/SBA-15 in the region of ca. 700–1100cm−1 are attributed to vibrations of P–O in the central PO4 unit, and to WO and W–O–W of PW11, although bands at 900–1050cm−1 are partially obscured by the presence of silica [27]. The results indicate that the primary POM structure remains intact after immobilization onto the mesoporous silica surface. This is also consistent with the ICP elemental analysis data (Table 1). Similar results (Table 2 ) were obtained in other RE–PW11/APTS/SBA-15 spectra. Fig. 1(b) shows the IR spectra of SBA-15, APTS/SBA-15, Eu–PW11/APTS/SBA-15 and H3PW12O40/APTS/SBA-15. One may find that all three aminosilated samples exhibit the bands at 1508–1530cm−1 attributed to vibrations of protonated amino groups, which indicates that part of the amino groups of RE–PW11/APTS/SBA-15 are protonated. Fig. 2 shows the low angle XRD patterns of APTS/SBA-15 and Y–PW11/APTS/SBA-15 in the 2θ range of 0.5–5°. Both samples exhibit three peaks indexed to characteristic (100), (110) and (200) diffractions of hexagonal mesoporous SBA-15, which indicates that these samples consist of well-ordered channels [32]. Therefore, the primary structure of SBA-15 is maintained after aminosilylation and immobilization of RE–PW11. The immobilization of RE–PW11 inside SBA-15 channels results in a decrease in the intensity of all diffractions, which is probably attributed to the pore filling of the host material with RE–PW11. Low angle XRD patterns of other RE–PW11/APTS/SBA-15 give the same results. The nitrogen sorption isotherm of Y–PW11/APTS/SBA-15 in Fig. 3 is of type IV classification, which is a hysteresis loop typical of mesoporous materials [32]. The surface modified and Y–PW11 immobilized samples retain the same shape of the isotherm as that of SBA-15. The physicochemical parameters of SBA-15 after immobilization of other RE–PW11 are shown in Table 3 . The results show that aminosilylation of the surface and immobilization of RE–PW11 account for the decrease in pore volume and surface area. However, pore size of RE–PW11/APTS/SBA-15 samples does not change significantly, which probably indicates that RE–PW11 is only immobilized in part of the channels. The above characterization results confirm that RE–PW11 clusters are located inside the channels and the mesoporous channels are still preserved. The 31P NMR spectra of bulk Y–PW11 and the immobilized Y–PW11/APTS/SBA-15 (Fig. 4 ) show only one resonance at −12.9 and −13.0ppm with full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of 336 and 200Hz, respectively. The similar chemical shifts indicate that the PW11 and the sandwiched structure are generally unchanged after immobilization. The slight shift is possibly caused by slight change of local structural environment of P in the isolated POM anion after introduced in SBA-15 compared to the POM in bulk crystal. It is interesting to note the considerable decrease in FWHM after introducing Y–PW11 onto the channel surface of the support. Since there is only one P site in the POM anion attributed to the NMR resonance, the decrease in FWHM is possibly caused by easier motion of isolated POM anion after introduced in SBA-15. In Fig. 5 , the exemplified TEM images of the Sm–PW11/APTS/SBA-15 further demonstrate that the hexagonal ordered channel structure of SBA-15 has no significant change after aminosilylation of SBA-15 and immobilization of Sm–PW11 into the channels. The polyoxometalates filled in the pores of SBA-15 are shown by the highly contrast lines in comparison with pure SBA-15. 3.2 Catalytic testing The catalytic activity of RE–PW11/APTS/SBA-15 in heterogeneous oxidation of cyclohexene with hydrogen peroxide was tested and the results are shown in Table 4 . Besides cyclohexene epoxide as the main product, a variety of byproducts such as cyclohexanone, 2-cyclohexen-1-ol, 2-cyclohexen-1-one and trans-1,2-cyclohexanediol are observed, indicating that the reaction was complicated. The results indicate that cerium and heavier lanthanide complexes are generally somehow less effective for oxidation of cyclohexene (Table 4). Considering its redox potential, Ce(III) may be partially oxidized by H2O2 to Ce(IV), leading to the decrease in the amount of active species. For the heavier lanthanides there is a lanthanide contraction effect, resulting in stronger ionic interaction between the smaller central lanthanum atom and the two PW11 moieties. This makes the rendering degradation by H2O2 to polyperoxotungstates more difficult, lowering the catalytic activity [26,27]. It is also shown in Table 4 that the absolute conversion for bulk RE–PW11 are higher than those for the immobilized ones, but the latter have much higher catalytic efficiency per POM unit than the bulk POM. This higher efficiency should be attributed to the high dispersion of POM. When bulk RE–PW11 is used as catalyst, the dissolution of bulk RE–PW11 is significant after 4h reaction. Nearly half amount of bulk RE–PW11 leaches into the solutions after solid–liquid separation. However, RE–PW11/APTS/SBA-15 shows high stability in polar solvent, where the leaching of POM is negligible and the catalytic activity of the five times recycled catalyst remains unchanged, indicating that the strong interaction between RE–PW11 and the amino groups on the silica surface prevents leaching of active species of POM. According to the 31P NMR study, no signal is detected in the solution after reaction for 12h with the Y–PW11/APTS/SBA-15 catalyst, showing that the loss of Y–PW11 could be neglected. In contrast, under the same reaction condition the conversion of cyclohexene decreases significantly over PW12/APTS/SBA-15, and 31P NMR signal could be detected in the filtered reaction solution. Therefore, the introduction of rare earth centre into POM helps enhance the interaction between RE–PW11 and the amino groups grafted on the silica channel surface. The enhanced interaction prevents POMs from leaching into the reaction solution, although the mechanism how the RE centre works is not clear yet. The catalytic activity and reusability of RE–PW11 (Sm–PW11 and Nd–PW11 were chosen) supported on unmodified SBA-15 were also tested. The amount of RE–PW11 and other reaction conditions are the same as those for RE–PW11/APTS/SBA-15. In the first run, the cyclohexene conversion and cyclohexene epoxide yield over RE–PW11/SBA-15 are similar to those over RE–PW11/APTS/SBA-15. However, the leaching of POM from RE–PW11/SBA-15 is significant. RE–PW11/SBA-15 recycled after the fifth run shows almost no catalytic activity, and none of RE, P, W can be detected by the ICP elemental analysis. Thus, it could be concluded that the amino group on SBA-15 has the effect of immobilizing RE–PW11. To check whether the Y–PW11 immobilized on APTS/SBA-15 support or the dissolved homogeneous Y–PW11 is the real catalyst responsible for the present oxidation, the following experiment was carried out [33]. After reaction for 2h in which the cyclohexene conversion reached ca. 41%, the reaction mixture was filtered and then the mother liquor (filtrate) was allowed to react for another 8h under the same reaction condition. No significant activity was observed, demonstrating that the active species are not the dissolved Y–PW11 leached from Y–PW11/APTS/SBA-15. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that the present catalysis is heterogeneous in nature. 4 Conclusion The rare earth metal sandwiched POM, RE–PW11, is immobilized in the channels of aminosilylated ATPS/SBA-15. RE–PW11/APTS/SBA-15 combines catalytic activity of RE–PW11 and high surface area of SBA-15 and shows higher catalytic efficiency per POM unit than the bulk POM. There is strong interaction between RE–PW11 and amino groups grafted on the silica channel surface, leading to negligible leaching of RE–PW11 species and ease in separation in solid–liquid phase after catalytic reaction. Such a kind of material may be used as environmentally benign heterogeneous catalyst for the oxidation of olefins under mild conditions.
