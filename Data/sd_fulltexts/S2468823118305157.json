Graphical abstract In this study, CeO2-Nb2O5 and CeO2-Fe2O3-Nb2O5 mixed oxides used for the selective catalytic reduction of NO with NH3 (SCR) were prepared and the performance of these two samples was investigated. Given the modification of Fe2O3, catalyst sulfur resistance was significantly improved with the SCR activity remaining almost unchanged. For CeO2-Nb2O5 sample, SO2 reacted with the main redox sites, CeO2, to form inactive species, Ce2(SO4)3. By contrast, SO2 preferentially interacted with Fe2O3, which left surface cerium oxygen species preserved for CeO2-Fe2O3-Nb2O5 catalyst and enabled this sample with an enhanced SO2-resistant ability. At the same time, SO4 2− on the Fe2O3-added catalyst exhibited a lower stability. It seemed that CeO2-Fe2O3-Nb2O5 sample might be easily recycled via H2 regeneration at a relatively low temperature point and be a potential catalyst for the applications in the SCR systems. Keywords CeO2-Nb2O5 CeO2-Fe2O3-Nb2O5 SO2-resistant ability SCR Ce2(SO4)3 1 Introduction The selective catalytic reduction of NO with NH3 has been regarded as an effective method to control NO x emissions from both mobile and stationary sources [1]. WO3- or MoO3-modified V2O5/TiO2 is the industrialized catalyst system in stationary applications. However, the narrow operation temperature window (320–420 °C), together with the toxicity of V2O5 to the environment and human health, makes it necessary to develop high-activity and environmentally benign catalysts. Recently, CeO2 has drawn much attention because of its high oxygen storage capacity and excellent redox properties [2–7]. When used as active species, promoters or supports, Ce-containing catalysts always exhibit over 90% NO x conversion in the temperature region of 250–450 °C [8–13]. However, this catalyst system is quite sensitive to SO2 poisoning. When exposed to the SO2-containing flue gas, surface cerium oxygen species inevitably interact with SO2 to form Ce2(SO4)3 or Ce(SO4)2, which mainly explains the decreased activity of the catalysts in the SO2-deactivation period and constitutes the main barrier to the industrialization of CeO2-based catalysts in the SCR systems [14–16]. Apart from CeO2, Fe2O3 has also been proved to be an active metal oxide for the SCR reactions; the novel reducibility of Fe2O3 would contribute to the activation of NH3 and NO x , hence making Fe2O3-based catalysts have an outstanding SCR activity in the medium temperature range [17–19]. Moreover, a good SO2 durability could be obtained for this catalyst system; the as-formed Fe2(SO4)3 species can still act as an active site to catalyze the reduction of NO with NH3 [20]. Therefore, a combination of CeO2 and Fe2O3 might enable a catalyst with a wide operation temperature window and an enhanced SO2-resistant ability. In this study, we would investigate the sulfur resistance of CeO2-Nb2O5 mixed oxide, which has been proved to possess a satisfactory activity and N2 selectivity in a wide temperature range in our previous study [21,22], and the effect of Fe2O3 modification on the performance of this catalyst under ideal and SO2-containing conditions. And some characterization methods would be adopted to get insight into the transformations of the catalyst surface properties before and after SO2 poisoning. Knowledge of such an effect would help to make CeO2-based catalysts commercially used in the SCR systems in the near future. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of the samples CeO2-Nb2O5 (denoted as CeNb) and CeO2-Fe2O3-Nb2O5 (CeFeNb for short) mixed oxides were prepared using the co-precipitation method. Briefly, the calculated amount of Ce(NO3)3, NbCl5 and Fe(NO3)3 (when needed) was dissolved in methanol. And then the obtained solution was slowly added into excessive ammonia solution under stirring. The precipitates were then collected and filtered for several times until no residue Cl− was detected (using AgNO3 solution). After drying at 110 °C overnight, the catalysts were calcined at 500 °C for 5 h, which were then crushed and sieved into 40–60 meshes for the activity tests. In the case of CeNb catalyst, the molar ratio of Ce: Nb was 1: 1. While for CeFeNb sample, the molar ratio of Ce:Fe:Nb was 1:1:2. In a typical sulfation procedure, the as-synthesized catalysts were exposed to a flow stream containing 200 ppm SO2, 5% O2 and balanced N2 for 16 h. The total flow rate was 200 mL min-1. The sulfated samples were named as CeNb-S and CeFeNb-S. 2.2 Reaction systems Activity tests of the series catalysts were conducted in the reaction system. Briefly, 0.3 g catalyst was used. The reactant gas contains 667 ppm NO, 667 ppm NH3, 5% O2, 200 ppm SO2 (when used), 5% H2O (when used) and N2 in balance. The total gas flow rate was 600 ml min−1, corresponding to a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 120,000 mL g−1 h−1. The inlet and outlet concentrations of NO and NO2 were recorded using an online gas analyzer (Testo 350). The NO x conversion was calculated using the following equation: (1) N O x c o n v e r s i o n % = 100 % × ( N O i n + N O 2 i n - N O o u t - N O 2 o u t ) ( N O i n + N O 2 i n ) Where NOin, NO2 in, NOout and NO2 out refer to the inlet and outlet concentrations of NO and NO2. Catalyst deactivation status was evaluated using the relative activity value of X/X0, in which X is the NO x conversion at certain time during the SO2-deactivation period and X0 is the NO x conversion of fresh catalysts [23]. 2.3 Characterizations XRD measurements were conducted on a Rigaku D/max 2550PC system equipped with CuK α radiation. N2 adsorption-desorption experiments were performed to explore the catalyst texture properties. Catalyst specific surface areas were calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method was adopted to determine the pore size distributions of the series samples. Raman spectra were recorded using a Renishaw inVia spectrometer equipped with an Ar ion laser (514.4 nm line). Ammonia-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) experiments were carried out using a chemisorption analyzer (Micromeritics, ChemiSorb 2720 TPx). Prior to each experiment, samples were pretreated at 350 °C for 1 h in Ar to remove the impurities, followed by cooling down to 100 °C. Afterwards, the tested sample was saturated with NH3 for 2 h and flushed by Ar for 1 h to remove the physically adsorbed NH3. Finally, the temperature was increased to 800 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1 in Ar. NH3 signal was measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Hydrogen-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were conducted using a chemisorption analyzer (Micromeritics, ChemiSorb 2720 TPx). We first pretreated the tested sample at 350 °C for 1 h in Ar to remove the impurities, followed by cooling down to 50 °C. Then the temperature was increased to 1000 °C at a heating ramp of 10 °C min−1 in a mixture of 5% H2/Ar. H2 consumption was measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to measure the oxidation state of each element in all the samples. It was performed on ESCALab220i-XL electron spectrometer from VG Scientific. The base pressure was about 3 × 10−9 mbar. Before analysis, the binding energies (BE) were calibrated to the C 1 s line at 284.8 eV. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) was carried out on an FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet NEXUS 6700), equipped with an MCT/A detector. Prior to each experiment, samples were pretreated at 300 °C for 1 h in He to remove the impurities. The IR spectra were recorded by collecting 64 scans, with a resolution of 4 cm−1. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Performances of the catalysts The effect of SO2 on the activity of the series catalysts is illustrated in Fig. 1 . Upon the purging of SO2 into the reaction system, the relative activity of CeNb catalyst continuously decreases to ca. 0.57 after 20 h. While for Fe-modified catalyst, this parameter decreases slightly and almost reaches a stable value of ca. 0.92 in the whole SO2-deactivation cycle. This result suggests that the introduction of Fe2O3 to the CeNb catalyst greatly improves the SO2 resistance, making it more suitable for industrial applications. After the cessation of SO2 purging, the relative activity of the two samples cannot be restored to their initial values, indicating that this inhibition effect is irreversible. By contrast, the relative activity of the series catalysts still remains above 0.94 when exposed to the H2O-containing flue gas after 16 h. This result indicates that the effect of H2O on the performance of the catalysts at a relatively high temperature region could be negligible, which is consistent with previous studies [24]. For these reasons, this study mainly focuses on the SO2-tolerant ability of the series samples. According to previous studies [25], catalyst sulfur tolerance would be closely related to the activity of the samples before and after SO2 poisoning. As is shown in Fig. 2 , fresh CeNb and CeFeNb catalysts exhibit a superior activity; over 90% NO x conversion could be observed for these two samples between 250 and 450 °C. By contrast, the sulfation process exerts a negative effect on the low-temperature activity of the catalysts to different extents. For SO2-treated CeNb sample, the NO x conversion under 350 °C is always below 90%. Given the modification of Fe2O3, the NO x conversion value at 300 °C increases from ca. 80% to ca. 95%, which is indicative of the improvement in the sulfur resistance of CeFeNb catalyst and consistent with the results in Fig. 1 to some extent. 3.2 Physical properties XRD patterns in Fig. 3 illustrate that these four samples are inherently amorphous in structure and all the components are highly dispersed. Raman spectra of the series samples are shown in Fig. 4 . Some weak peaks centering at ca. 602 and 812 cm−1, which could be ascribed to the characteristics of Nb species, come out [21]. Given that CeNb and CeFeNb samples are treated in the SO2-containing flue gas, little change has taken place in the series Raman peaks, suggesting that catalyst crystal phases remain almost unchanged after the sulfation process. Table 1 demonstrates the texture properties of the series catalysts. Before sulfation, CeNb and CeFeNb catalysts possess a high specific surface area, the value of which reaches 171 and 139 m2/g, respectively. After sulfation, a dramatic decline in the surface area occurs. And it should be noted that a larger decline scope of surface area is presented during the sulfation process for CeNb catalyst (from 171 to 62 m2/g) compared with that of Fe-containing sample (from 139 to 88 m2/g). That might partially explain the enhanced sulfur resistance of CeFeNb catalyst. 3.3 Acid properties Fig. 5 demonstrates the NH3-TPD profiles of the series catalysts. It seems that there exist three NH3 desorption peaks for all the samples during the heating process. The first peak centering in the range of 100–250 °C could be attributed to NH3 adsorbed on weak acid sites; the peak ranging between 250 and 300 °C is related to NH3 linked to sites with intermediate acidity. While the last peak, of which the temperature is higher than 300 °C, could be ascribed to NH3 bonded to strong acid sites [26]. And it should be noted that the intensity of the NH3 desorption peaks obviously increases after the sulfation process, suggesting that abundant acid sites are formed on the sulfated catalysts. The strong and excessive adsorption of NH3 might in part explain the decreased NO x conversion of the catalysts after the purging of SO2 into the reaction system [27]. In situ DRIFTS experiments were performed to investigate the acid site distributions of the samples using NH3 as a probe at 100 °C (Fig. 6 ). First, the attribution of the peaks is summarized as follows. 981 cm−1: NbO fundamental band; 1162–1206 and 1575–1605 cm−1: symmetric and asymmetric bending vibration of NH3 on Lewis acid sites; 1431 and 1669–1679 cm−1: asymmetric and symmetric bending vibration of NH4 + on Brønsted acid sites. Over CeNb and CeFeNb samples, both Brønsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites are present. The negative peak at 981 cm−1 implies that NbO is involved in NH3 adsorption. In our previous study, NbO could act as Lewis acid sites [21]. For sulfated samples, i.e. CeNb-S and CeFeNb-S, the peaks for NH3 coordinated on Lewis acid sites and NbO fundamental band almost disappear, while the intensity of those for NH4 + on Brønsted acid sites becomes rather strong. In order to further clarify the effect of sulfation on the catalyst acid properties, we carried out the NH3 desorption experiments at different temperatures over the series catalysts using in situ DRIFTS and the results are shown in Fig. 7 . With the temperature going up, we could observe in Fig. 7(a) and (b) that the peak intensity for NH4 + on Brønsted acid sites decreases quickly and vanishes at 300 °C, while the bands for NH3 on Lewis acid sites and NbO fundamental still remain. After calculating the relative concentrations of NH3 adsorbed on Lewis acid sites and Brønsted acid sites (Fig. 7(e) and (f)), it can be concluded that ammonia species linked to Lewis acid sites exhibit a higher thermal stability than those on Brønsted acid sites, which is consistent with previous studies [28]. By contrast, the peak intensity for NH4 + in Fig. 7(c) and (d) decreases slightly as the temperature increases. These results suggest that sulfate species on the catalyst surface could act as the main and strong Brønsted acid sites for NH3 adsorption. As is mentioned above, the sulfation process leads to the occurrence of the variations in the acid properties of the series samples; the as-introduced strong acid sites are responsible for the stabilization of abundant ammonia species on the catalyst surfaces, which might in turn affect the activation of the adsorbed NH3 and NO x in a certain extent, thereby causing the declined low-temperature activity of the catalysts. 3.4 Redox properties H2-TPR profiles of the series samples are shown in Fig. 8 . According to previous studies, the peak centering at ca. 480 °C for CeNb catalyst could be attributed to the reduction of surface reactive oxygen species [21]. Upon the modification of Fe2O3, this peak shifts towards lower temperatures, suggesting that there exist some synergetic interactions between CeO2 and Fe2O3 and oxygen species on the CeFeNb catalyst exhibit a higher reducibility [29,30]. Given that the catalysts are treated in the SO2-containing flue gas, H2 reduction peaks shifting to higher temperatures could be observed, suggesting that the oxidability of the catalysts is weakened by sulfation. That would exert an inhibitory effect on the activation of NH3 and NO x , constituting another reason for the poisoning behavior of SO2 to these catalysts at lower temperatures. In the case of CeNb-S catalyst, the peak centering at ca. 720 °C could be attributed to the reduction of Ce2(SO4)3 [15,31]. While for CeFeNb catalyst, a H2 reduction peak at ca. 480 °C comes out, which could be explained by the reduction of Fe2(SO4)3 [20]. This result indicates that SO4 2− on the Fe-added catalyst surface owns a lower thermal stability. XPS method was used to explore the surface atom environment of the series catalysts. According to Fig. 9 (a), it seems that Ce3+ and Ce4+ coexist in the fresh and SO2-poisoned samples. After deconvolution and calculation (Fig. 9(b)), a significant increase in the relative concentration of Ce3+ occurs for CeNb catalyst after sulfation (from 25.5% to 42.6%) [32]. That result implies that Ce2(SO4)3 may easily form on the CeNb catalyst when exposed to the SO2-containing flue gas, which constitutes the main reason for the declined activity of Ce-based catalysts in the lower temperature region. By contrast, the amount of Ce3+ just increases slightly for Fe2O3-added catalyst during the sulfation cycle (from 24.5% to 31.9%); it seems that doping Fe2O3 could protect CeO2, which acts as a vital redox site for the activation of NH3 and NO x , from being sulfated to Ce2(SO4)3. That might be an important reason for the improved sulfur resistance of Fe2O3-modified sample. In Fig. 9(c), the binding energies of the Fe 2p peaks illustrate the existence of Fe atoms in the +3 oxidation state [28,33]. Given the exposure to the SO2-containing flue gas, the characteristic peaks assigned to Fe atoms shift towards higher binding energies, suggesting that parts of Fe species interact with the as-formed sulfate anions. After the curve fitting of S 2p spectra (Fig. 9(d)), the obtained two peaks could be indexed to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 transitions of SO4 2− [34]. Compared with sulfated CeNb sample, a higher electron cloud density around the S atoms could be observed for CeFeNb-S sample, as is demonstrated by the decreased binding energies of the S 2p bands. That result suggests that SO4 2− formed on the Fe-modified catalyst surface might own a lower thermal stability [35,36], which is consistent with the H2-TPR results in Fig. 8. And it should be noted that the amount of sulfate species accumulated on the CeFeNb catalyst is some higher than that on the CeNb catalyst (Table 2 ), eliminating the possibility that a lower surface concentration of SO4 2− constitutes the main reason for the higher activity of CeFeNb-S catalyst than that of CeNb-S sample. 3.5 Reaction mechanisms (1) NO + O2adsorption. In order to study the detailed reaction mechanisms of the series catalysts, investigating the surface nitrite or nitrate species constitutes the first step, since some of those species can directly or indirectly participate in the reaction with the reductant NH3. The DRIFTS spectra of NO + O2 on the series catalysts are shown in Fig. 10 . For the two fresh catalysts, some characteristic peaks at 1229, 1579, 1604 and 1614 cm−1 come out, which could be attributed to bridging nitrate, bidentate nitrate, gaseous NO2 molecules and N2O4, respectively [29,37]. After the sulfation process, these bands disappear. This is because the as-introduced sulfate species compete with NO for the adsorption sites on the catalysts, thereby exerting an inhibitory effect on the adsorption of NO and causing the absence of nitrite or nitrate species over the catalysts [34]. It seems that some variations in the reaction pathways might be caused by the sulfation process, which would be uncovered using the transient reaction methods. (2) Reaction between adsorbed NH3and gaseous NO. Fig. 11 demonstrates the DRIFTS spectra of the series NH3-adsorbed catalysts in a flow of NO and O2 at 300 °C. After the adsorption of NH3, the characteristic peaks related to NH3 bonded to Lewis acid sites appear for the two fresh catalysts, while the bands ascribed to NH4 + linked to Brønsted acid sites are present for the sulfated samples. Given that NO and O2 are simultaneously purged into the cell, the intensity of the NH3 bands decreases to different extents, suggesting that NH3 species, both on Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, could participate in the reaction with NO. In the case of CeNb sample, some bands attributed to nitrate species come out during the reaction process, while no obvious peaks indexed to adsorbed-NO x species could be detected for CeFeNb catalyst. This finding indicates that nitrite or nitrate species formed on the Fe2O3-modified catalyst surface own a lower thermal stability and the Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction pathway might be cut off with the introduction of Fe2O3. Similar with the phenomena of CeFeNb catalyst, only the Eley-Rideal reaction pathway might dominate over the two sulfated catalysts. (3) Reaction between adsorbed NO and gaseous NH3. Fig. 12 shows the DRIFTS spectra of the series NO x -adsorbed catalysts in a flow of NH3 and O2 at 300 °C. In the case of CeFeNb and the two sulfated samples, no obvious peaks could be observed, suggesting that NO is hardly adsorbed on these catalysts (Fig. 12(b)–(d)). Given that NH3 and O2 are added into the cell, characteristic peaks related to ammonia species are generated. This result further confirms that Eley-Rideal mechanism, rather than Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, mainly contributes to the SCR reactions over CeFeNb and the two sulfated catalysts. By contrast, the bands assigned to gaseous NO2 (1601 cm−1), bidentate nitrate (1584 cm−1) and bridging nitrate (1219 cm−1) come out after the saturation with NO for CeNb sample (Fig. 12(a)) [38]. Switching the gas to NH3 causes the decrease in the intensity of the NO2 peak, suggesting that gaseous NO2 functions as the reactive species during the SCR reactions. Meanwhile, characteristic peaks indexed to ad-NH3 species at 1190, 1441, 1606, 1668 cm−1 come out [39]. Besides, the peaks related to bidentate nitrate and bridging nitrate centering at 1584 and 1219 cm−1 shift towards 1572 and 1233 cm−1, respectively, which might be due to the interactions between ammonia and these adsorbed-NO x species [22]. This finding reveals that bidentate and bridging nitrate species act as the acid sites for the adsorption of NH3 rather than the reactive species to react with NH3; apart from Eley-Rideal mechanism, Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism is also involved when the reaction proceeds over CeNb catalyst. 3.6 Discussions It is well accepted that SCR reactions could proceed via Eley–Rideal mechanism and/or Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism. For CeNb catalyst, both Eley–Rideal mechanism and Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism are involved in the lower temperature region. During the Langmuir–Hinshelwood process, the as-formed NO2 has been proved to be the reactive species in the reaction with NH3. Given that this catalyst is treated in the SO2-containing flue gas, the as-introduced sulfate species would cover certain sites for NO x adsorption and activation on the catalyst surfaces, thereby inhibiting the formation of reactive nitrogen-containing species [34]. That might partially decrease the activity of CeNb catalyst in the SO2-deactivation cycle [40,41]. In other words, only Eley–Rideal mechanism dominates in the SCR reactions over the sulfated CeNb catalyst, during which process the dehydrogenation of NH4 + or NH3 species by the adjacent redox sites constitutes the rate-determining step [33]. In the sulfation period, CeO2, the main redox sites in the CeNb catalyst, interacts with SO2 to form inert Ce2(SO4)3, which introduces abundant strong acid sites at the cost of the loss of some redox sites. The excessive and strong adsorption of NH3, together with the weakened redox properties, would exert an inhibitory effect on the activation of NH3 and NO x [27]. This result, together with the dramatic decrease in the specific surface area by ca. 64% (from 171 m2 g−1 to 62 m2 g−1), further explains the declined activity of CeNb catalyst at low-temperature regions. By contrast, the modification of Fe2O3 promotes the SCR reactions to proceed via Eley–Rideal mechanism rather than Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism. Therefore, the sulfation process would hardly affect the reaction pathways dominated over CeFeNb catalyst. Similar with CeNb-S catalyst, the activation process of ammonia species by the redox sites mainly determines the reaction rate of CeFeNb-S catalyst; the introduced SO4 2− also deactivates some redox sites and stabilizes excessive ammonia species on the catalyst surfaces, thereby resulting in a decreased low-temperature activity. However, it should be noted that Fe2O3 in the CeFeNb sample is prone to interacting with SO2 to form Fe2(SO4)3, leaving parts of surface cerium oxygen species free from deactivation by SO2; the preserved Ce-related redox sites would be still utilized to efficiently activate NH3 and NO x . Moreover, the as-formed Fe2(SO4)3 could act as a new active site for the SCR reactions in comparison with the relatively inactive Ce2(SO4)3 [20]. Besides, the specific surface area of CeFeNb sample just decreases by ca. 37% (from 139 m2 g-1 to 88 m2 g-1) after the sulfation process; a relatively higher surface area makes CeFeNb-S catalyst provide more active sites for the SCR reactions in comparison with CeNb-S one. These findings would enable CeFeNb-S sample with a higher activity than Fe-free counterpart. Consequently, the introduction of Fe2O3 could increase the activity of the sulfated sample from ca. 80% to ca. 95% at 300 °C. It is known that catalyst SO2-resistant ability is closely related to the performance of the samples before and after SO2 poisoning. Considering that both of CeNb and CeFeNb mixed oxides exhibit nearly 100% NO x conversion at this temperature point, the improvement in the performance of SO2-deactivated sample would in turn enhance the SO2 resistance properties of the catalyst in a certain extent. Therefore, CeFeNb catalyst possesses a higher SO2-tolerant ability than CeNb sample. In addition, SO4 2− on the Fe2O3-modified catalyst surface exhibits a lower thermal stability, which makes it possible to regenerate SO2-deactivated CeFeNb catalyst in H2 at a relatively low temperature point and suggests that CeFeNb mixed oxide might be a potent catalyst for the applications in the SCR systems [16]. 4 Conclusions We modified the cerium-niobium mixed oxide catalyst with iron oxide to improve its SO2 resistance for the selective catalytic reduction of NO with NH3. Some main conclusions are obtained as follows: (1) The modification of Fe2O3 significantly enhances the SO2-resistant ability of CeNb catalyst. Given that SO2 is purged into the reaction system, the relative activity of CeFeNb catalyst still remains above 0.9 after 20 h, much higher than that of CeNb catalyst (ca. 0.57) (2) Fe species preferentially interact with SO2 so that parts of surface cerium oxygen species could be preserved, which makes the reducibility of CeFeNb catalyst decrease slightly to an adequate level after sulfation. That mainly explains the improved sulfur resistance of Fe2O3-modified sample. (3) SO4 2− on the Fe2O3-modified catalyst exhibits a lower thermal stability, which makes it possible to regenerate SO2-poisoned CeFeNb catalyst in H2 at a relatively low temperature point and suggests that CeFeNb mixed oxide might be a potential catalyst for the applications in the SCR systems.

        "dc:description": "In this study, CeO2-Nb2O5 and CeO2-Fe2O3-Nb2O5 mixed oxides used for the selective catalytic reduction of NO with NH3 (SCR) were prepared and the performance of these two samples was investigated. Given the modification of Fe2O3, catalyst sulfur resistance was significantly improved with the SCR activity remaining almost unchanged. For CeO2-Nb2O5 sample, SO2 reacted with the main redox sites, CeO2, to form inactive species, Ce2(SO4)3. By contrast, SO2 preferentially interacted with Fe2O3, which left surface cerium oxygen species preserved for CeO2-Fe2O3-Nb2O5 catalyst and enabled this sample with an enhanced SO2-resistant ability. At the same time, SO4 2− on the Fe2O3-added catalyst exhibited a lower stability. It seemed that CeO2-Fe2O3-Nb2O5 sample might be easily recycled via H2 regeneration at a relatively low temperature point and be a potential catalyst for the applications in the SCR systems.",
