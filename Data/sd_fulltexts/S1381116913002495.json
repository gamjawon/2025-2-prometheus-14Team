Graphical abstract EPR and 27Al NMR were used to probe the nature of the phases that formed during the conversion of methane at high temperature on the Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst. It was shown that ammonium 6-molybdoaluminate III supported over silica gave rise, when reduced, to an EPR signal due to Mo5+ ions with the odd electron interacting with the nonzero nuclear spin of aluminum in much the same way as in HZSM-5. Therefore, the occurrence of this particular spin interaction should not be taken as evidence of the location of the Mo5+ ions at the exchange sites of the zeolites. Rather, combined 27Al NMR and EPR investigation of the reduction of a pure polycrystalline aluminum molybdate suggested that the observed signal in the case of the zeolite composite catalyst was due to Mo5+ ions formed within the Al2(MoO4)3 extra phase that formed upon dealumination of the zeolite in the presence of molybdenum. Keywords EPR NMR HZSM-5 Mo5+ Aluminum molybdate Carburization 1 Introduction Conversion of methane into useful chemicals has been and still is a subject of worldwide renewed efforts. Several routes have been explored over the previous two decades. In addition to methane conversion into syn gas which is of real industrial significance, more ambitious routes such as direct conversion into oxygenates [1–4], methanation of olefins, although this is a barely effective route to methane insertion in view of the unfavorable thermodynamics at the temperatures needed to activate methane and to reach measurable reaction rates [5], oxidative coupling of methane [6–9] and conversion of methane into benzene and hydrogen [10–29] were explored. The latest developments were concerned with the latter reaction carried out in the presence of various transition metal oxide-loaded inorganic carriers. Mainly molybdenum- and rhenium-based active components deposited over HZSM-5 were thoroughly investigated [22–31]. In the case of molybdenum-based catalysts, the activation procedure was scrutinized and it was generally agreed that, whatever the nature of the precursor, molybdenum was converted in the presence of methane, under the reaction conditions, into molybdenum carbide [12,13,24]. It was found by Lunsford et al. [13] that disappearance of Mo6+ from the original MoO3 and formation of Mo2C were virtually complete after exposure of the calcined catalyst to CH4 for a period of time corresponding to the initial activation period. It is now a general agreement that hexagonal Mo2C and/or fcc MoC1−x are the most probable active species responsible for the initial activation of methane. In this respect, Solymosi et al. [30] showed that bulk Mo2C mixed with H-ZSM-5 was active but not so active as MoO3 associated with H-ZSM-5. In addition, they found that partial oxidation of the carbide within the mechanical mixture improved its activity hinting at a possible involvement of an oxycarbide in the methane activation process. The interaction between the Mo species and HZSM-5 bears great significance for understanding the origin of the activity of Mo/HZSM-5 in the reaction of aromatization of methane under non-oxidative conditions. The valence states of Mo species together with the location of such species could give valuable information about the nature of the active centers. Many studies were directed at probing the nature of the interaction of molybdenum with HZSM-5 and the valence state of active molybdenum species [13,19,24,32–34]. For example Ma et al. [34] showed the presence of a pentavalent molybdenum within the Mo/H-ZSM-5 active binary system. The occurrence of a superhyperfine structure in the EPR signal of this Mo5+ was interpreted in terms of siting of the pentavalent molybdenum at the H-ZSM-5 exchange sites. They suggested that fully reduced Mo2C species in combination with the partially reduced MoO x species were responsible for the methane dehydroaromatization activity. It could be understood that the partially reduced MoO x species were in fact those labeled Al(II)…Mo5+, the very last to be reduced and that these are part of the active moiety. It appears from earlier studies that oxymolybdenum species and/or pentavalent molybdenum are thought to take some part in the conversion of methane into higher hydrocarbons. The aim of this study is to investigate the nature and the location of the paramagnetic Mo5+ with respect to the zeolite and the implication of this nature and location on the activity and stability of the binary catalytic system. 2 Experimental Silica supported ammonium 6-molybdoaluminate III was prepared by stirring silica (Davison) in the aqueous solution of the appropriate amount of the above pink compound to obtain 3% Mo by weight. Excess water was evaporated and the resulting mixture was dried at 80°C. 6% Mo supported on HZSM-5 sample was prepared by the usual impregnation method using ammonium molybdate as in Ref. [28]. The zeolite was a gift from Sud Chemie with a silicon to aluminum ratio of 28. As usual the impregnated sample was first dried overnight at 110°C and subsequently heated in oxygen to 650°C and maintained overnight at this temperature before carburisation or direct reaction with methane. Aluminum molybdate was prepared according to the procedure described by Kunath-Fandrei et al. [35], upon reacting ammonium molybdate with aluminum nitrate. The gel was subsequently crystallized by heating in air at 500°C. XRD showed the sample to be highly crystalline. EPR measurements were performed using a Varian E9 spectrometer operating in the X-band mode (9.4GHz) equipped with a 100kHz field modulation unit. Spectra were recorded using a dual cavity enabling recording the DPPH signal used as reference. Its signal appears in all figures as an isolated single line. The microwave power was set at 2mW and the modulation amplitude to 2G. Spectra were recorded at either room or liquid nitrogen temperature. 50mg samples were introduced into a 4mm outer diameter quartz tube under argon atmosphere following the desired treatment. The EPR cell and the setup used to activate and transfer the samples are depicted in Fig. 1 . MAS 27Al spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker DSX 400 using a 4mm sample holder rotating at 10kHz and a flip angle of 45° at 0.5μs intervals. 3 Results The Mo/HZSM-5 (6%Mo) carburized under a mixture of H2/CH4 at 700°C as described previously [28,29], then subjected to flowing methane at a rate of 0.8Lh−1 for 30min at the same temperature, gave rise to the EPR signal, shown in Fig. 2a measured at room temperature and Fig. 2b at liquid nitrogen temperature. This signal is, in general, less complex than the one observed by Ma et al. [34]. Nevertheless, the spectrum includes, in both cases, an almost isotropic signal with g ⊥ =1.945 and g || =1.878. Two of the low field hyperfine lines due to 95Mo nuclear spin are evident on the perpendicular component (A ⊥ =68G), together with a partially resolved superhyperfine pattern probably due to an indefinite number of Al nuclei (I =5/2), more than one in view of the number of bumps on each g component, with A Al =6–8G. The carbon signal is also present though not at the intensity observed by Ma et al. [23]. No change was observed on keeping the sample under methane at room temperature. The 27Al NMR spectrum of the fresh sample exhibited the familiar absorption at 51ppm (Fig. 3a). When kept for 30min on stream under methane flow at 700°C, the corresponding 27Al NMR absorption was broadened considerably but was still centered at 53ppm (Fig. 3b). There was no enhancement of the spinning sidebands, indicating that the increased line width (threefold) was not due to increased quadrupole interaction or increased chemical shift anisotropy but rather to a span of chemical shifts. By contrast, the absorption around 0ppm ascribed to non-framework aluminum is barely visible. However, upon re-oxidation in air at 500°C, the corresponding 27Al NMR spectrum was unchanged except for the absorption at −13ppm (Fig. 3c) which may be safely attributed to the formation of an aluminum molybdate phase in perfect agreement with Kunath-Fandrei et al. [35] who reported Al chemical shifts extending from −10.3 to −13.4ppm, and with Liu et al. [36] who reported a chemical shift of −15ppm. While the former group investigated an authentic aluminum molybdate, the latter was identifying the phases forming within the Mo/HZSM-5. Longer periods on stream, under the reaction conditions, produced a slightly stronger signal with no better resolved superhyperfine pattern and an even stronger signal due to carbonaceous deposits. Further reaction with methane resulted in such a carbon rich solid that tuning of the EPR cavity became impossible. The corresponding 27Al NMR spectrum, shown in Fig. 4 , was severely broadened and dramatically reduced in intensity and experienced a significant shift to higher fields, clearly suggesting an extensive dealumination accompanied by a probable partial loss of crystallinity. Silica supported ammonium 6-molybdoaluminate III, heated in air at 500°C for 3h, then reacted with flowing methane at 700°C for 3h, gave an EPR spectrum shown in Fig. 5 . There are three signals: The carbon deposit signal at the free electron g value, a sharp signal possibly due to Mo5+ ion in a silicomolybdate species and a more familiar Mo5+ signal with a partially resolved superhyperfine structure similar to the one observed with the Mo/HZSM-5 system when activated in air and subsequently maintained under a stream of methane at 700°C for 0.5–2h. The g values are: g ⊥ =1.945 and g || =1.896 very close to the values found in the case of the Mo/HZSM-5 system. This partially resolved superhyperfine structure is essentially the same in both cases under very similar treatment conditions. The case of the aluminum molybdate is also of interest. When heated in air at 500°C and then reacted with methane for a very short period, typically 5–15min, at the same temperature, the sample turned pale yellow to grayish and gave rise to the EPR spectrum shown in Fig. 6 . The observed rather narrow and resolved signal could be analyzed in terms of an axial g and A tensors with g ⊥ =1.931, A ⊥ =42G and g || =1.876 and A || =95G. Upon heating stepwise at increasingly higher temperatures, up to 700°C, the signal was broadened via the occurrence of a strong and broad shoulder at the low field side of the perpendicular component. This progressive broadening and obscuring of the initial narrower signal can be observed in Fig. 7a–d. Clearly, the overall signal is the result of the overlap of the initial narrow signal by a broader one with a perpendicular mean g component at 1.951 and a mean parallel component at 1.874. Interestingly, an ill resolved superhyperfine pattern appeared and was very similar to the one observed in the case of Mo/HZSM-5 system subjected to the dehydro-aromatization reaction. Interestingly, no carbon signal was ever observed, clearly indicating that aluminum molybdate may not be active in the conversion of methane, not even into carbon and hydrogen. 4 Discussion Although poorly resolved, the superhyperfine structure clearly hints to the interaction of the 4d1 unpaired electron with the only nonzero nuclear spin – excluding 1H – within the Mo/HZSM-5 system. The poor resolution is probably due to the combination of two factors: The dipolar spin spin interaction as a result of a too concentrated paramagnetic species and the heterogeneous crystal field prevailing at each Mo5+ species resulting in a span of g tensor values adding to the individual line width of each microcrystal. It may be seen from the report of Ma et al. [34], that the resolution improved as the overall signal intensity decreased, causing spin dilution and suppression of the dipolar interaction. EPR is known to be a very sensitive tool to detect minute quantities of radicals or other paramagnetic species. This is essential in catalysis where active centers or intermediates may not have a sufficient lifetime to ensure an adequate concentration to be detected using less sensitive means. One such example has been provided by Lunsford [7] who was able to demonstrate the O− oxide ion on MgO was the active center to abstract a hydrogen atom from methane to achieve the further coupling of two methyl radicals. However, the detection of a paramagnetic center during an activation process or even during the course of a reaction is by no means a guarantee of the identification of an active center or an intermediate species. A typical example is the frequent detection of the well known symmetric signal at g =2.0023 indicative of the formation of carbonaceous species of an undetermined nature. Other examples include the progressive formation and deposit of spectator species at the expense of active centers or desired products. Therefore EPR results have to be dealt with cautiously with the help of additional other spectroscopic and kinetic data in order to avoid pitfalls. In this case, for example, the assertion that the occurrence of the interaction of the unpaired electron with the aluminum nuclear spin is indicative of the location of the Mo5+ ions at the exchange sites of the zeolites, under the prevailing conditions, is less than straightforward. Indeed, Mo5+ in various zeolites was abundantly investigated, including in the MFI type, using EPR spectroscopy and various methods were used to anchor the molybdenum species at the exchange sites, such as the sublimation of molybdenum hexacarbonyle and molybdenum pentachloride. In no case any such superhyperfine structure as that reported by Ma et al. was reported. 27Al NMR showed in this study and in a study emanating from the former group by Liu et al. [36], that a dramatic dealumination was occurring, especially favored by high molybdenum loadings to form the crystalline and stable aluminum molybdate phase at the expense of the zeolite lattice aluminum atoms. Therefore, as the zeolite was being depleted of aluminum and consequently from the exchange sites and as the Mo species were attracted to form a rather stable phase, the anchoring of the high valent Mo5+ ions at the exchange sites to occur seems improbable, particularly since the high valence state of these ions would require more than one Al centered tetrahedron to balance the +5 charge of this ion, even though extra framework oxide ions might help in this matter. However, very few extraframework oxide ions, if any, would be still available as the carburization would proceed under a heavily reductive atmosphere. The fact that the occurrence of the superhyperfine pattern due to the interaction of the unpaired electron with the Al nuclear spin is by no means a reliable criterion to locate the corresponding ion at the exchange sites, is corroborated by the appearance of a similar pattern in the case of silica supported ammonium 6-molybdoaluminate III reduced by methane under the reaction conditions. It is simply indicative of the presence of aluminum in the second coordination sphere of the molybdenum ion. Furthermore, the 27Al NMR clearly showed that activation of the zeolite composite system resulted in a disruption of the MFI structure, although most of the aluminum atoms were still in a tetrahedral coordination. These were probably partially bound to SiO4 tetrahedra and presumably to a MoO4 tetrahedron as a prelude to the formation of the identified molybdate. The fact that the aluminum fraction involved in the molybdate phase was not detected prior to re-oxidation is probably indicative of the presence of paramagnetic Mo5+ ions within this phase, resulting in a broadening of the Al signal beyond detection. Following an appropriate period on stream, Liu et al. [36] have conclusively shown that almost all zeolitic aluminum atoms were engaged in the aluminum molybdate crystalline extra phase. In an effort to identify the location of the Mo5+ ions and to confirm the suggestion from the broadening of the Al signal of the Al molybdate prior to re-oxidation, we have investigated the stepwise reduction of a pure aluminum molybdate powder. As seen from Fig. 6, the well defined Mo5+ signal is quite different from the one arising from the reduction of the Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst under reaction conditions. However as the aluminum molybdate was more and more severely reduced by increasing the reduction temperature, a broader signal was superimposed on the initial one as may be seen from Fig. 7. The broad signal grew at the expense of the sharp one and as the reduction temperature reached 650°C, the overall signal was very similar to that of the real catalyst. It is very probable that, as the number of Mo5+ increased, the crystal field was varying due to the substitution of hexavalent ions by pentavalent ones, bringing about modifications of the bond lengths and distortions of the bond angles of the original molybdate structure. It is thus likely that the observed Mo5+ ions are located in the extra phase resulting from the association of the molybdate tetrahedra and the aluminum extracted from the zeolite during the carburization period and/or the aromatization reaction in accordance with the report of Liu et al. [36] who observed that the aluminum molybdate phase grew with increasing the molybdenum content and/or the heating temperature. That HZSM-5 with this high silicon to aluminum ratio should undergo dealumination at this reaction temperature may seem surprising. However there are other parameters, apart from the sole Si/Al ratio, that determine the Al stability within the lattice: (i) the crystal size and shape of the individual crystals: The larger the size, the higher the stability. Large size coffin shaped crystals exhibit the highest stability. By contrast cauliflower shaped agglomerates of tiny individual crystals are the least stable; (ii) the siting of aluminum with respect to the surface: Depending on the synthesis conditions, there may be an aluminum gradient within the individual crystals. Sometimes this gradient is desired in order to distribute the Al ions as close to the surface as possible because they actually generate the active centers in catalysis. In such a case the actual local surface Si/Al ratio is then low and these ions are readily accessible to any dealumination agent present in the medium; (iii) zeolites are metastable crystalline compounds, stability of which depend on the thermodynamics of the mixture in which they may be present and they evolve as the phase diagram would dictate under specific conditions. Therefore it is not surprising in this case where the zeolite was synthesized for catalysis purposes that the aluminum ions were driven to form aluminum molybdate under these carburization conditions. It is worth to mention the very interesting work by Derouane et al. [37] who designed a low temperature carburization procedure using butane producing a slightly different carbide but also probably preventing extreme dealumination of the zeolite to end up with a catalyst of higher activity and stability. This dealumination process in the course of the carburization may also account for the existence of an optimum Mo loading beyond which the efficiency of the catalyst should be reduced due to a dramatically dealuminated zeolite component. Hence, the earlier observation by a number of authors that the activity of the binary MoO3/HZSM-5 catalytic system grew initially with the Mo content to an optimum value then receeded may be understood not only in terms of a possible clogging, not always proven in view of the low molybdenum content with respect to the large zeolite porous network, but more probably in terms of increased formation of the aluminum molybdate phase. The increased formation of this extraphase acts as a sink of both the molybdenum and the aluminum, therefore decreasing simultaneously the residual acidity and the expected carbide phase. Also Derouane and coworkers [37] have conclusively shown that formation of the fcc MoC1−x carbide using butane and hydrogen at mild temperatures in the carburization step led to a much more active catalyst than the hexagonal Mo2C obtained via the high temperature procedure. It is likely that at mild temperature, formation of the aluminum molybdate phase via the dealumination of the zeolite is precluded, thus preserving the acidity and the zeolite structure and the molybdenum to the exclusive formation of the useful carbide. Likewise, Chen et al. [38] reported that mechanical mixtures of MoO3 and HZSM-5 were more active in the conversion of methane than the heptamolybdate impregnated HZSM-5 under the same conditions. They concluded that lesser interaction of the MoO3 with the zeolite preserved more acid sites and resulted in better catalysts. It is probable that mechanical mixtures barely lead to the dealumination of the zeolite and the formation of the aluminum molybdate spectator phase. It is only at high Mo contents (>16%) that the optimum activity was observed. 5 Conclusion The conversion of methane at elevated temperatures resulted in the formation of aluminum molybdate as a result of the dealumination of the zeolite and the availability of molybdenum oxide. The moderate reduction of the aluminate gave rise to isolated Mo5+ ions in a well defined environment. More severe reduction resulted in Mo5+ ions in various crystal fields due to the partial disruption of the original lattice in the close vicinity of these ions. Interestingly, the Mo5+ signal observed in the case of the aluminum molybdate is very similar to the one observed in the case of the Mo-zeolite catalyst suggesting that, in the case of the zeolite, in addition to the carbide deposited on the surface of the zeolite, a sizeable fraction of the molybdenum is present as aluminum molybdate hosting the pentavalent paramagnetic Mo ions. These ions are interesting probes to monitor the changes occurring within the Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst. Indeed the presence of such Mo5+ is indicative of the formation of the aluminum molybdate phase and accounts for drastic loss of activity both with increased Mo content or increased carburisation temperature. Monitoring the formation of the Mo5+ concentration is a convenient method to improve the activation procedure of the binary catalyst in order to prevent dealumination and form preferentially the carbide instead of the aluminum molybdate.
