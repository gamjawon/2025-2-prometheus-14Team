ABSTRACT Amorphous ZIF-62(Co) glass (ag-ZIF-62(Co)) was prepared and used as peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activator for the degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX). In the presence of 0.1 g/L ag-ZIF-62(Co) and 0.2 mmol/L PMS, approximately 98.6% of SMX with an initial concentration of 5.0 mg/L was degraded within 30 min. The main reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved were sulfate radical (SO4 •-) and singlet oxygen (1O2), with concentrations of 41.1 and 171.9 μmol/L, respectively. A fixed-bed reactor packed with ag-ZIF-62(Co) was constructed for continuous SMX degradation, achieving nearly complete decontamination and 50% reduction in chemical oxygen demand over a period of 120 h. This study has paved a new avenue for exploring the potential application of metal-organic framework glasses in water purification through advanced oxidation processes. Graphical Abstract Amorphous ZIF-62(Co) glass (ag-ZIF-62(Co)), prepared from ZIF-62(Co) crystals by melt-quench treatment, was applied for micropollutant degradation via peroxymonosulfate activation for the first time, which showed good degradation performance and stability. Keywords Metal-organic framework glasses Sulfamethoxazole degradation Advanced oxidation processes Degradation mechanism Fixed-bed reactor Recently, various advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been widely explored to degrade various toxic and refractory organic pollutants from wastewater [1,2]. Organic pollutants can be degraded by reactive oxygen species (ROSs), high-valent metals [3–5] and electron transfer processes [6–8] yielded from various peroxides like peroxodisulfate (PDS), peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) [2,9–11] activated by catalysts containing different transition metals [12–14] with/without additional energy input [15,16]. Large amount of researches demonstrated that Co based catalysts are preferred in the PMS-AOPs for decomposing organics [17,18]. Some Co-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts like ZIF-67 [19] and ZIF-9 [20] were selected to activate PMS and PDS. However, it was deemed that these Co-MOFs suffered from unsatisfied water stability and difficult recovery. Recently, MOFs glasses derived from MOFs crystals attracted increasing interests in the fields of battery anode [21], oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [22] and gas separation [23–25]. For example, some MOFs glasses like ZIF-62(Co)/ZIF-62(Zn) [26,27] and ZIF-4 [28,29] have been prepared, resulting from that the ZIF-62(Co)/ZIF-62(Zn) and ZIF-4 precursors displayed higher glass-forming ability (GFA) judged by Kauzmann “2/3 law” [30,31]. Up to now, no reports declared that MOF glasses were used as catalysts to activate oxidants for organic pollutants degradation. It was expected that the transition metals in the MOF glasses might provide active catalysis sites to accomplish heterogeneous catalysis. Within this proof-of-concept work, the amorphous ZIF-62(Co) glass (ag-ZIF-62(Co)) was prepared to activate PMS for effective organic pollutants elimination. The ag-ZIF-62(Co) was yielded from ZIF-62(Co) crystals via the melt-quench following the previous report with some modifications [21]. In detail, ZIF-62(Co) crystals as precursors were synthesized via solvothermal method according to the previous report (Text S2) [27]. The deep purple ZIF-62(Co) crystal particles showed irregular polyhedron with a diameter ranging from 200 to 300 μm (Figs. S1(a) and S1(b)). The as-prepared ZIF-62(Co) crystals were heated in N2 atmosphere at 460 °C for 30 min with a ramp rate of 10 °C/min, then being cooled down to 325 °C for 30 min with a cooling rate of 10 °C/min. Finally, ag-ZIF-62(Co) was collected after being cooled down to room temperature. The size of the as-prepared ag-ZIF-62(Co) increased to 1.0–1.5 mm after melt-quench treatment (Figs. 1(a) and (b) ). As shown in Fig. 1(c), the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of as-prepared ZIF-62(Co) crystal fitted well with those simulated from the single crystal data [27]. After being changed into glass by melting and quenching, the amorphous ag-ZIF-62(Co) displayed no significant diffraction patterns (Fig. 1(c)), confirming the disordered and amorphous structure [28]. From the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) determination, the peaks of C 1s for both ZIF-62(Co) crystal and ag-ZIF-62(Co) can be fitted into two peaks at 284.6 and 286.0 eV (Fig. 1(d)), which could be assigned to C–C and C=C, respectively. The peaks at 398.8 and 400.1 eV were assigned to C=N–C and C–N–H (Fig. 1(e)) [32], implying that the imidazole (Im) and benzimidazole (bIm) ligands still remain in ag-ZIF-62(Co). This result was consistent with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), as shown in Fig. 1(f). The peaks at 1465, 1235, 1082 and 668 cm–1 could be attributed to C–N stretching, C–H in-plane-bending, C–H out-of-plane-bending and ring deformation out-of-plane- bending in the Im and bIm ligands [21]. The peaks at 1676 cm–1 can only be observed in ZIF-62(Co) crystal, which are associated with C=O of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) trapped in ZIF-62 crystal [21]. No peak was detected at 1676 cm–1 in ag-ZIF-62(Co) sample due to the escape of the DMF molecules during heating [21,26]. As shown in Fig. 1(g), the peak at 430 cm-1 in ZIF-62(Co) crystal was shifted to 426 cm–1 in ag-ZIF-62(Co) due to the recombination of Co and Im or bIm ligands during the melt-quenching [29]. The SMX (5.0 mg/L) was selected as the target contaminant to evaluate the degradation performance of the as-obtained ag-ZIF-62(Co) in a PCX50C reactor (Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd). It was observed that SMX was hardly adsorbed or degraded by alone ag-ZIF-62(Co), alone H2O2 and ag-ZIF-62(Co)/H2O2. About 98.6% and 70.4% SMX were degraded within 30 min in ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PMS system and ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PDS system, respectively (Figs. 2(a) and S2), superior to those in the presence of alone PMS and PDS, showing that PMS and PDS could be activated by ag-ZIF-62(Co). The k obs of SMX degradation in ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PMS system (k obs = 0.1121 min–1) was higher than that in ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PDS system (k obs = 0.0320 min–1). This was because that PMS was easier to be activated by the Co site due to its longer and asymmetry O–O bond [33]. The influences of PMS concentrations and ag-ZIF-62(Co) dosages on SMX degradation were shown in Figs. 2(b) and (c) and S3(a). When the concentrations of PMS increased from 0.2 to 0.3 mmol/L, the SMX degradation efficiencies were maintained at ca. 99.0%. Increasing the ag-ZIF-62(Co) dosages from 0.1 to 0.3 g/L hardly influenced the SMX degradation efficiencies, possibly due to the self-quenching of radicals at higher concentrations [34,35]. Overall consideration of the SMX degradation and the leaching cobalt concentrations (Fig. S3(b)), the dosage of PMS and catalyst were confirmed as 0.2 mmol/L and 0.1 g/L for subsequent experiments. Meanwhile, the ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PMS system could effectively degrade SMX in a broad pH range of 3.0–9.0 (Fig. 2(d)). Various inorganic anions in real waste water might influence the organic pollutants degradation behaviors during SR-AOP process [36,37]. Five common inorganic anions, SO4 2–, NO3 –, H2PO4 –, Cl– and HCO3 –, were introduced to explore their influence on SMX degradation in ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PMS system. As shown in Fig. 3(a) , the SMX degradation efficiencies weren’t noticeably inhibited by SO4 2– and NO3 – at concentration of 1.0–10.0 mmol/L. H2PO4 – is generally considered as a masking agent [38] to abate the reaction. But the SMX degradation in ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PMS system was enhanced slightly in presence of 5 mmol/L H2PO4 –, which probably due to the PMS activation by H2PO4 – [39]. The SMX degradation efficiencies declined in presence of HCO3 –, which might be due to the quench of SO4 •– by HCO3 – to generate less reactive HCO3 • (Eq. (1)). (1) HCO3 – + SO4 •– → SO4 2– + HCO3 • The addition of Cl- with the concentrations ranging from 1.0 to10.0 mmol/L greatly enhanced SMX decomposition efficiencies, in which 100% SMX was degraded within 2 min (Fig. 3(b)). It was reported that The Cl- might react with PMS to generate HClO, which can enhance the 1O2 yields (Eqs. (2)–(4)) [40]. To identify the generation of HClO in ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PMS/Cl– system, NH4 + was used to quench HClO (Eq. (5)) [40–42]. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the SMX degradation efficiencies declined when (NH4)2SO4 or NH4Cl was added as the quencher of HClO in the solution. (2) HSO5 – + Cl– ↔ SO4 2– + HClO (3) HSO5 – + 2Cl– + H+ → SO4 2– + Cl2 + H2O (4) Cl2 + H2O → HClO + HCl (5) HClO + NH4 + → NH2Cl + H3O+ (k = 3.1 × 106 L mol–1 S–1) The ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PMS system could accomplish outstanding degradation performances toward SMX with the concentrations of 5.0 and 1.0 mg/L in the simulated wastewater solution formulated from tap water and pure water (Figs. 3(d) and S4). The SMX degradation efficiencies in ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PMS system reached 98.6% (5 mg/L, high purity water), 85.0% (5 mg/L, tap water), 96.0% (1 mg/L, high purity water) and 91.0% (1 mg/L, tap water), showing an excellent anti-interference ability. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used to study the charge-transfer resistance of the ag-ZIF-62(Co). As displayed in Fig. S5, a smaller arc radius could be observed in ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PMS system, suggesting a faster charge transfer between ag-ZIF-62(Co) and PMS. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves (Fig. 4(a) ) showed low current responses in both ag-ZIF-62(Co) and ag-ZIF-62(Co)/SMX systems, while the highest current response in ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PMS/SMX, evidencing that PMS could be activated by ag-ZIF-62(Co) to produce different reactive oxygen species (ROSs) for SMX degradation [43]. To identify the main ROSs in ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PMS system for SMX degradation, tert-butanol (TBA), Benzoquinone (BQ) and L-Histidine (L-His) were used to quench hydroxyl radical (·OH), superoxide radical (O2 •–) and 1O2, respectively. As well, methanol was selected to quench both SO4 •– and •OH. As shown in Figs. S6 and 4(b), the SMX degradation over ag-ZIF-62(Co) slightly decreased when 1 mmol/L BQ or 100 mmol/L TBA was added, in which the k obs values were decreased from 0.1261 to 0.0846 and 0.1091 min–1, respectively. Whereas the SMX degradation efficiencies were reduced by 50.0% within 30 min, and the corresponding k obs values decreased from 0.1261 to 0.0140 and 0.0116 min–1 after MeOH and L-His was added, respectively, implying that SO4 •– and 1O2 might be the main ROSs for SMX degradation. To further confirm the generation of ROSs in ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PMS system, electron spin resonance (ESR) test was carried out using 5,5-dimethylpyrroline (DMPO) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) as spin trap agents. As shown in Figs. 4(c) and S7, no characteristic signal was observed in ag-ZIF-62(Co) alone system, suggesting that those ROSs could hardly be generated from self-decomposition of PMS. When PMS and ag-ZIF-62(Co) coexisted in the solution, the characteristic ESR peaks of DMPO-SO4 •–, DMPO-•OH and DMPO-O2 •– were observed. Similarly, the peaks of TEMP-1O2 were detected in ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PMS system, confirming the nonradical 1O2 specie was generated during the PMS activation. Furthermore, the main ROSs (SO4 •– and 1O2) were quantified through the reactions between SO4 •–/1O2 and 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA)/1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF), in which the residual PMS was measured by I3-generated from the reaction between PMS and KI. As presented in Figs. S8 and 4(d), the yields of SO4 •– and 1O2 were 41.1 and 171.9 μmol/L within 30 min, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4(e), 0.11 mmol/L PMS was depleted within 30 min, demonstrating that the PMS utilization efficiency in ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PMS system is ca. 55.0%. The results of quenching experiment, ESR determination and quantifications of ROSs suggested that SO4 •– and 1O2 generated from PMS activation over ag-ZIF-62(Co) might be the main ROSs in ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PMS system. XPS was adopted to test the oxidation states of Co ions in ag-ZIF-62(Co) before and after reaction (Figs. S9 and 4(f)). The peaks at 780.7 and 796.4 eV are assigned to Co3+ 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2. The peaks at 782.2 and 798.4 eV are assigned to Co2+ 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2, as well as the peaks at 786.4and 803.3 eV corresponded to their satellite peaks (Sat.) [43,44]. The percentage of Co3+ decreased from 72.35% in the fresh sample to 71.91% in the used sample after reaction. While the percentages of the corresponding Co2+ increased from 27.65% to 28.09%. Based on the quench experiments, XPS, ESR, quantification experiments and electrochemical test, the SMX degradation might result from the synergistic effect between ag-ZIF-62(Co) and PMS [45,46]. Based on the above results, the possible mechanism for SMX removal in ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PMS system was proposed. The circular reaction of Co2+ and Co3+ was the key to generation of SO4 •–/SO5 •–, respectively (Eqs. (6) and (7)). It was believed that 1O2 could be generated from the self-reaction of SO5 •–, the reaction between SO5 •– and H2O or the self-decomposition process of PMS (Eqs. (8)–(11)) [38,44,47,48]. (6) Co(II) + HSO5 – → Co3+ + SO4 •– + OH– (7) Co(III) + HSO5 – → Co2+ + SO5 •– + H+ (8) SO5 •– + SO5 •– → S2O8 2–/2SO4 2– + 1O2 (9) 2SO5 •– + H2O → 2HSO4 – + 1.51O2 (10) HSO5 – → SO5 2– + H+ (11) HSO5 – + SO5 2– → SO4 2– + HSO4 – + 1O2 The reusability and stability of ag-ZIF-62(Co) was evaluated by cyclic experiments and fixed-bed experiments (Fig. 5 ). The SMX degradation efficiencies still maintained up to 98.5% after five cycles in ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PMS system (Fig. 5(a)). Meanwhile, the leaching Co (Fig. 5(b)) and PXRD (Fig. S10) of ag-ZIF-62(Co) after reaction affirmed the good stability of ag-ZIF-62(Co). To evaluate the possibility of practical application, a simple fixed-bed reactor (D = 24 mm; L = 240 mm) was built (Figs. 5(c) and (d)), in which 100.0 mg ag-ZIF-62(Co) were divided into 5 equal portions to be packed between cotton sheets. The simulated solutions containing SMX with concentrations of 5.0 and 1.0 mg/L formulated from high purity water or tap water (the flow rate was 5.0 mL/min, hydraulic residence time was 10.85 min) and PMS solution (50.0 mmol/L; 1.5 mL/h) were injected into the reactor. The SMX degradation efficiencies in different reaction systems were shown in Figs. 5(e) and S11, in which the SMX degradation efficiencies could be maintained up to 96.0% (5 mg/L in high purity water), 98.0% (1 mg/L in high purity water) and 90.0% (1 mg/L in tap water). Besides, up to 50% COD can be removed within 72 h (Fig. 5(f)), showing the excellent potential for continuous operation. Also, the actual pharmaceutical wastewater was adopted to test the degradation performance of ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PMS system, where ca. 38% COD was removed (Fig. S12). Five degradation pathways were proposed based on the determination results of high- resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) (Fig. S11) further, and the toxicity of the intermediates were assessed by toxicity analysis (T.E.S.T.). The results demonstrated that SMX was degraded into small molecules with lower toxicity. Also, the ag-ZIF-62(Co) was adopted as catalyst to activate PMS for decomposing various organic pollutants. As shown in Fig. S15, the removal efficiencies of atrazine (ATZ), bisphenol A (BPA), chloroquine phosphate (CQ), ofloxacin (OFC) and rhodamine B (RhB) with the concentration of 5.0 mg/L were 79.3%, 89.7%, 84.9%, 81.5% and 100.0%, respectively, showing a good universality to degrade different pollutants. In conclusion, the ag-ZIF-62(Co) was used to active PMS for decontamination for the first time. The ag-ZIF-62(Co) can accomplish effective PMS activation for outstanding micropollutant degradation without additional energy input. Complete SMX was degraded in ag-ZIF-62(Co)/PMS system within 30 min, where SO4 •– and 1O2 were the major ROSs for SMX degradation. Furthermore, the home-made fixed-bed reactor packed with ag-ZIF-62(Co) as catalyst could achieve continuous and efficient SMX degradation. This work proved that MOF glasses were the potential catalysts to induce the heterogeneous AOPs for micropollutants decomposition, which might attract increasing attentions in the near future.

        "dc:description": "ABSTRACT Amorphous ZIF-62(Co) glass (ag-ZIF-62(Co)) was prepared and used as peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activator for the degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX). In the presence of 0.1 g/L ag-ZIF-62(Co) and 0.2 mmol/L PMS, approximately 98.6% of SMX with an initial concentration of 5.0 mg/L was degraded within 30 min. The main reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved were sulfate radical (SO4 •-) and singlet oxygen (1O2), with concentrations of 41.1 and 171.9 μmol/L, respectively. A fixed-bed reactor packed with ag-ZIF-62(Co) was constructed for continuous SMX degradation, achieving nearly complete decontamination and 50% reduction in chemical oxygen demand over a period of 120 h. This study has paved a new avenue for exploring the potential application of metal-organic framework glasses in water purification through advanced oxidation processes.",
