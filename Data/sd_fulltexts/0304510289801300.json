Department of Organic Technology, Slovak Technical University, 812 37 Bratislava (Czechoslovakia) (Received October 5,1988; accepted January 13, 1989) Summary The oxidation of p-xylene in anhydrous acetic acid was studied at a temperature of 120 C and a pressure of 0.6 MPa using Co Br Py catalysts. The oxidation proceeds through several stages, which are influenced by the composition of the catalyst and are characterized by different reaction rates and total amount of consumed oxygen. Cobalt complexes with the molar ratio Co: Br: Py = 1:2:1-2 have the highest catalytic activity in the first stage of the reaction. Introduction The large industrial importance of terephthalic acid during recent decades has inspired research workers in their efforts to seek more efficient catalytic systems for its preparation from p-xylene. In commercial processes, acetic acid is the most used solvent for p-xylene oxidation. The basic com- ponent of the catalyst is cobalt, mainly in synergistic mixtures with other metals or bromide [1]. In the systems containing cobalt and bromide ions, a significant increase in oxidation rate was observed after the addition of certain nitrogen-containing compounds which can enter the coordination sphere of Co(II) as a ligand [2, 3]. Pyridine is one of the most effective nitrogen-containing compounds in this system [4]. In spite of extensive research in this area, there are numerous unsolved problems concerning the influence of these nitrogen-containing compounds on the catalytic activity of Co(II). Ziolkowski and Rybak [5] reported that oxo-centered Co(III) clusters are catalytically active in the oxidation of alkylaromatic hydrocarbons in the absence of bromide. Sumner and Steinmetz [6, 7] have isolated oxo- centered Co(III) clusters [Py3Co30(AcO)sL] [PFJ (L = OH or AcO) from the reaction mixture of p-xylene oxidation catalyzed by Co(AcO)a, HBr and pyridine in acetic acid containing NH4PFg. From the acetic acid they have also isolated and entirely characterized the cluster [Py3Co30(AcO)50H]\"1\" 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 106 [PyCoBr3]~, which is assumed to be a catalyst intermediate in the cobalt- catalyzed oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons. Pyridine in this cluster stabilizes Co(III), which results in the slow reduction of Co(III) by peroxides and slow oxidation of bromide to bromine radical. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of the composition of catalytic systems composed of Co(AcO)2, HBr and pyridine on the rate of p-xylene oxidation in anhydrous acetic acid. Experimental Materials Co(AcO)2'4H20, HBr and pyridine (all A. G. purity) were used without purification. Acetic acid and p-xylene were purified by methods cited by Perrin [8]. Preparation of the catalyst solutions The solutions with the corresponding molar ratio of Co:Br:Py = a'.b'.c (a, b and c are integers from the interval 0 -10; a + b + c = 10) were prepared from three basic solutions. The basic solutions contained 0.04 mol dm\"3 of: a = Co(AcO)2, b = HBr and c = pyridine in acetic acid. In order to remove the dissolved water on aliquot amount of acetic anhydride was added into each basic solution. Oxidation procedure Two cm3 of p-xylene and 10 cm3 of solution of catalyst prepared from basic solution were added into the reactor described in our previous paper [9]. The reactor was flushed with oxygen and the oxygen consumption was measured at a temperature of 120 C and a pressure of 0.6 MPa. The evaluation of experimental data From the dependence of consumed oxygen (in mol 0; per mol p- xylen) versus time, the rates of oxidation (in mol 0^ per mol of p-xylene per min; mol of p-xylene means the initial amount of p-xylene in mols) were calculated at different amounts of consumed oxygen. Some of these dependences are shown in Fig. 1. The rates of oxidation and amounts of consumed oxygen determined for different catalyst compositions at the end of the first broad maximum of the reaction rate and at the beginning of the second one are depicted in the triangular diagrams. The same levels or rates of oxygen consumption in these diagrams are connected by curves (Figs. 2 - 8). Results and discussion At certain experimental conditions, the oxidation of p-xylene by molecular oxygen in acetic acid has three easily distinguished stages (A, B, 107 mol On mol p-X 1,6 0,4 20 40 60 t min (b) 0,4 0,8 1.2 1,6 0,4 0,8 1,2 molO^/molp-x Fig. 1.

All concentrations are in mol dm-3. Points are the measured amounts of consumed oxygen at a given time. (b) Rates of oxidation of p- xylene in acetic acid at different amounts of consumed oxygen. Conditions as in (a). C, Fig. 1). The first stage (A) is characterized by a broad maximum of the reaction rate (Fig. lb). Stage A is finished at a total consumption of oxygen lower than 0.65 mol 0; per mol ofp-xylene (Fig. 2). The next stage (B) is 108 characterized by a relatively stable level of the reaction rate, and ends at a total oxygen consumption of 0.7 -1.2 mol 0^ per mol p-xylene, depending on the composition of the catalyst (Fig. 3). However, at relatively high Co(II) concentration and low HBr and Py concentrations, the oxidation begins without stage A (Figs. Ib and 2). In the last stage (C), the oxygen consumption has an oscillatory character, especially if the catalyst is composed of all three components (Fig. 1). The maximum oxidation rate in stage A is influenced by the com- position of the catalyst, and is highest at the molar ratio of components Co:Br:Py = 1:2:1-2 (Fig. 4). In stage A the total oxygen consumption is largest when the initial concentration of PyH'^Br\" is very high (Fig. 2). It is known that during oxidation of p-xylene the concentration of Br~ rapidly decreases [10]. If on the basis of results derived from Fig. 4 one accepts the assumption that during stage A the complexes with molar ratio Co:Br:Py = 1:2:1-2, i.e. the complexes CoBrzPy or [PyH'^nCoBr^^AcO)]\" and CoBr^Py^ or [PyH^^CoBr^AcC^], have the highest catalytic activity, then high oxygen consumption in this stage can be obtained at high initial concentration of the mentioned complexes or when Br~ ions are added to this catalytic system, e.g. in the form of PyH'^Br\". Thus, PyH'^Br\" is a source of Br~ during stage A. (In all triangular figures the position corresponding to the composition of the complex CoBr^Py is labelled (A) and CoBr2Py2 by ( )). Despite the decrease in Br~ concentration during p-xylene oxidation, the highest catalytic activity in the whole stage A obeys the above- HBr Py HBr Py Fig. 2.

Dependence of the maximum oxidation rate in stage A (mol Oa per mol p-xylene per min) on the catalyst composition. For conditions see Fig. 2. mentioned complexes. Thus, the highest initial rate of oxygen consumption is at a molar ratio Co:Br:Py near 1:2:1 (Fig. 5). The same situation was observed at oxygen consumption 0.3 mol 0; per mol p-xylene. But at the value of 0.6 mol 0^ per molp-xylene there are already two regions of higher oxidation rates (Fig. 6). The first is near the initial ratio Co:Br:Py = 1:2:1-2 and the second one in the region of high cobalt and low Br~ concentrations, and particularly at low pyridine concentration. At a total consumption of 0.8 -1.0 mol 0^ per mol p-xylene, the oxidation process is for practically all initial concentrations in stage B. (At low initial concentrations of Br~, the oxidation is already in stage C). From the dependence of oxidation rate on the ratio of the catalyst components (Fig. 7), it follows that in stage B the mixtures with initial molar ratio Co:Br:Py = 1:2:1-2 exhibit high catalytic activity. However, it should be C Co HBr Py HBr py Pig. 5. Dependence of the initial rate of oxidation on the composition of the catalyst. For conditions see Fig. 2. Fig. 6.

Influence of the catalyst composition on the rate of oxidation at total oxygen consumption of 1 mol 0; per mol p-xylene. For conditions see Fig. 2. mentioned that at high oxygen consumption the concentration of Br~ in the reaction mixture is already very low, but in systems without Br~, pyridine has a retarding influence on the oxidation ofp-xylene. Thus if Br\" is absent, Co AcO Py complexes are catalytically inactive. (After 2 h the consumption of oxygen was less than 0.01 mol 0; per mol p-xylene). Stage C begins with an intense increase in oxygen consumption rate, up to the value limited by oxygen transfer from the gas to the liquid phase. In this stage, the oxidation rate exhibits an oscillatory behaviour. The amount of oxygen consumed during the first maximum of oxidation rate in stage C depends on the catalyst composition (Fig. 8). The presence of pyridine has a marked retarding influence on this amount. Oxidation in the absence of Br\" does not reach stage C within 10 hours. Important information about the catalytic activity of Co-Br Py complexes can be obtained from the comparison of catalytic activity with the distribution of complexes formed in solution at various ratios of the catalyst components. Unfortunately, no information is available in the HBr Py Fig. 8. Influence of the catalyst composition on the amount of oxygen consumed in the first fast period of stage C. For conditions see Fig. 2. Ill literature about the distribution of ternary Co Br Py complexes in acetic acid. Sawada and Tanaka [11] have described stability constants for binary Co Br complexes in acetic acid (Table 1). Computer calculation of these data for highly over- and underestimated values of the stability constants (our measurements were carried out at higher temperature and lower ionic strength) leads to large variations in the distribution of the corresponding bromocobaltous complexes (Fig. 9). However, the position of the maximum concentration of the given complex is practically the same, and is found at close to the molar ratio of their cobalt and bromine components. A comparison of the reaction rates at different amounts of consumed oxygen with the distribution of cobalt complexes containing various numbers of bromide ligands suggests that the highest catalytic activity cannot be unambiguously attributed to only one bromocobalt complex formed in the reaction system (Fig. 9).

In the first stage, tetrahedral bromo- cobaltous complexes have the highest catalytic activity. In the next stage the rate of oxidation is relatively stable, but the initial concentration of Br~ strongly influences the rate and the depth of oxidation. The third stage of the reaction is characterized by the oscillating character of the reaction rate. The amplitude and the frequency of these oscillations depend on the catalyst composition.
