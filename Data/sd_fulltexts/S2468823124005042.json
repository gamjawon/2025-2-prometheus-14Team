Doping carbon-based materials with heteroatoms is considered an effective strategy to enhance their catalytic activity by altering their electronic structure and chemical properties. In this study, fluorine doped activated carbon was synthesized and used in acetylene dimerization reaction. Fluorine has the highest electronegativity (3.98) and can induce neighboring carbon atoms to possess a stronger positive charge, thereby generating Lewis acid sites between the two atoms. The resulting carbon material exhibited abundant Lewis acid sites ensuring the ample exposure and availability of catalytic sites to facilitate notable activity in acetylene dimerization. Theoretical calculations indicated that the introduction of F could help to alleviate the progression of polymers. This research provides a promising approach to the development of solid acid catalysts with excellent catalytic performance by incorporating Lewis acid sites onto carbon materials.

As a result, research on carbon materials has witnessed rapid advancements in modern materials science. The discovery of novel carbon materials has further stimulated interest in advanced carbon-based materials and their applications [1-5]. Meanwhile, the development of carbon materials requires the use of low-cost precursors and more efficient and environmentally friendly methods. Activated carbon (AC) is the most widely used carbon material in industry due to its low cost and easy large-scale production [6,7]. However, AC itself is not an efficient catalyst or support for most reactions. To tackle this issue, scientists have directed their attention towards doping carbon materials with non-metallic heteroatoms (e.g., N, B, S, and F) to alter their electronic structure and electrochemical properties [8,9]. Among these heteroatoms, fluorine (F) has the highest electronegativity (3.98) and can induce neighboring carbon atoms to possess a stronger positive charge [10]. This fluorine doping enhances surface disorder of carbon materials and creates abundant surface defects [11]. For example, Li et al. developed a fluorine interlayer-doped carbon catalyst that showed superior CO2-to-CO conversion and suppressed H2 evolution compared to pristine carbon. Their findings revealed that fluorine interlayer doping triggers the activation of neighboring carbon atoms, transforming them into active sites and aiding in the stabilization of the crucial intermediate COOH* on these sites [12]. The oxygen/fluorine co-doped carbon material has been reported by Chen et al., which showed excellent performance as the anode material of potassium ion battery. The desirable property arose from the co-doping of oxygen and fluorine, which not only enhanced the adsorption capacity for potassium ions but also could absorb multiple potassium ions with minimal structural distortion [11]. Meanwhile, Gao et al. also found that fluorine doping could impart an acidic character to carbon and act as an electron acceptor [13]. Zeng et al. developed a 3D F-doped carbon catalyst for N2 electroreduction, where the F-C bond created Lewis acid sites that hindered proton binding and enhanced the selectivity of N2 electroreduction into NH3 [14]. Therefore, the use of activated carbon doped with F as Lewis type solid acid catalysts holds the significant value of research. Coconut shell-derived activated carbon was employed to investigate the dimerization of acetylene for producing monovinylacetylene (MVA) [15]. It has been found that introducing metal-based Lewis acids into CuCl/AC catalysts could improve the dispersion and anti-loss ability of the active centers, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity [16]. In addition, the introduction of nitrogen into activated carbon could effectively enhance the activity and stability of the catalyst by strengthening the interaction between copper and the support, as well as promoting the dispersion of copper species on the support [17]. These findings indicated that both Lewis acid sites and heteroatoms play a positive role in the reaction. More studies have shown that there was a close correlation between catalyst deactivation and acid sites [18]. However, the extensive use of metal based Lewis acid additives limited the practical application of these catalysts. Therefore, it is necessary to explore an effective and environmentally friendly carbon-based solid acid catalysts with abundant Lewis acid sites for acetylene dimerization. Fortunately, F-doping could simultaneously introduce Lewis acid sites and heteroatom (F) into the carbon materials [13,14]. Herein, a series of F-doped coconut shell based activated carbon catalysts with abundant Lewis acid sites were synthesized to efficiently catalyze acetylene dimerization into MVA. To analyze the distribution of acid sites on activated carbon, as well as their influence on reaction activity, various characterization techniques including XPS, NH3-TPD, Py-FTIR, in situ DRIFTS, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were utilized. The AC with different mass fractions of F (0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 wt.%) were labeled as AC, 1FAC, 5FAC, 10FAC, 15FAC, and 20FAC, respectively. Similarly, the Cu-based catalysts were named Cu/AC, Cu/1FAC, Cu/5FAC, Cu/10FAC, Cu/15FAC, and Cu/20FAC, respectively. 2 Results and discussion To accurately determine the fluorine (F) element in activated carbons (ACs), oxygen bomb combustion and ion chromatography techniques were employed, given the difficulties in measuring F amounts directly. Fig. 1 a demonstrated that coconut AC inherently contains a minor quantity of F element. And F doping effectively enhanced the F content in the samples. However, the F content in activated carbon remains nearly constant when the theoretical doping amount of F exceeds 5 wt.%. This can be attributed to the difficulty and limited amount of F doping in carbon. Additionally, under high temperature conditions, fluorine tends to form gasses like hydrogen fluoride, leading to the loss of F [19]. The report highlights that even a minimal doping of F atoms could have a substantial impact on the electronic structure of carbon [11]. This is because fluorine has the highest electronegativity among all elements. Introducing F atoms into the carbon framework could efficiently induce positive polarization of nearby carbon atoms, creating highly polarized sites for effective adsorption [20]. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were presented in Fig. 1 b, while Table S1 provided the corresponding analysis. Compared to undoped AC, the specific surface area and pore volume of 5FAC were slightly increased after F doping, which may be due to the etching of the microporous walls or the release of gas during the fluorination process [21,22]. However, excessive F could cover the original carbon structure, leading to a decrease in the specific surface area and pore volume of activated carbons (ACs) [23]. Raman spectra were used to evaluate the level of defects and graphitization on the carbon surface. Fig. 1 c demonstrated that F doped ACs had higher ID/IG values than undoped AC, which may be attributed to structural collapse during the fluorination process. Another significant reason for this was the presence of structural defects such as vacancies and bonding disorders, which invariably accompany the incorporation of C-F functional groups. These factors led to an overall increase in disorder on the surface of activated carbon [19]. Furthermore, it has been reported that a higher ID/IG value indicated the presence of more surface defects, which could serve potential active sites for catalysts [6,13]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to analyze the presence of fluorine (F) in the activated carbon and investigate the chemical states and surface electronic structure of the samples (Fig. 2 ). The binding energy of the functional groups in the C 1 s region was 282.0 to 289.0 eV [14,24,25]. In Fig. 2 a, the C 1 s spectra were analyzed to identify four distinct peaks, and the findings were showed in Table S2. The composition of undoped AC included 47.5 % CC or C = C, 28.6 % COH or CO-C, 17.8 % C = O, and 6.1 % COOH. It was observed that the content of C = O remained unchanged, while the content of oxygen-containing groups on the AC decreased after F doping (especially the content of COH or CO-C). This was due to the fluorination reaction occurred at the C sites that should be connected with oxygen-containing groups [26]. The O1s spectrum could be divided into three peaks, representing different oxygen species in the sample, as shown in Fig. 2 b. These peaks to carbonyl groups (C = O) at ∼531.7 eV, hydroxyl or ether at ∼532.4 eV and carboxyl groups (COOH) at ∼533.2 eV [25,27,28]. Clearly, the reduction of hydroxyl and other oxygen functional groups resulted in a decrease in the acidic groups on the surface of the AC [29]. The surface acidity of activated carbon was a crucial characteristic that could be evaluated through NH3-TPD experimentation, and the details were summarized in Table S3. The peaks at 100 °C, which could be attributed to NH3 desorption from the channel (Figure S2). The peaks observed at 150–300 °C were associated with weak acid sites, while peaks at around 300–500 °C were assigned to strong acid sites [30]. The distinct peaks observed in the profiles indicated that the quantities of NH3 desorbed from the weak, strong, and total acid sites in undoped AC were 0.05, 0.23 and 0.28 mmoL/g, respectively. In comparison to undoped AC, the amounts of NH3 desorbed from the weak and strong acid sites in F doped AC exhibited a gradual increase with the introduction of F element, as illustrated in Table S3. Conversely, the ratios of weak and strong acid decreased as the F content increased. Previous studies have indicated that the reaction between Cu and NH3 will form Cux-NH3 bonds [31]. This could account for the increase in NH3 desorption from the weak, strong, and total acid sites in undoped Cu-based, reaching values of 1.00, 4.40, and 5.40 mmoL/g, respectively, as shown in Table S3. Similarly, this trend was also observed in the F-doped Cu-based catalyst. Moreover, the F-doped catalyst exhibited higher amounts of NH3 desorption from the weak and strong acid sites compared to the undoped catalyst. The above analysis showed that the introduction of F element effectively improved the acid site content on the surface of activated carbon and catalyst. Differentiating between Brönsted and Lewis acid sites is challenging, as NH3-TPD analysis has been shown to be inaccurate. As a result, the pyridine-FTIR was commonly employed to evaluate the samples (Fig. 3 a and Figure S3). The peaks observed at 1450 and 1540 cm−1 were indicative of Lewis and Brönsted acid sites, respectively [32,33]. Table 1 listed the relative amounts of Lewis and Brönsted acid sites, as well as their ratio (B/L). It was important to note that the acid content on the surface of these samples were lower compared to the NH3-TPD analysis results, primarily due to the abundance of acidic -OH groups [34,35]. The peaks at approximately 300 and 350 °C in the NH3-TPD profiles were attributed to the desorption of NH3 from Brönsted and Lewis acid sites, respectively [31,36]. In undoped AC, the content of Brönsted, Lewis, and total acid was1.78, 18.61, and 20.39 umoL/g, respectively. Fig. 3 b and c demonstrated that new Lewis acid sites were generated due to the difference in electronegativity between F and C atoms. This increased the Lewis acid and total acid content in F-doped AC [14,37]. Likewise, Table 1 presented the values of Brönsted, Lewis, and total acid sites in undoped Cu-based catalyst were 0.59, 9.75, and 10.34 umoL/g, respectively. Compared with activated carbon, the coverage of CuCl significantly reduced the number of acidic sites on the catalyst surface. This conclusion was consistent with the results obtained in N2 adsorption-desorption experiments. Additionally, it was observed that the Cu2+ ions were linked to Lewis acid site [36], whereas the Cu+ ions exhibited weaker acidity compared to Cu2+ [38]. XPS analysis indicated that the contents of Cu2+ in undoped and F-doped catalysts were essentially the same. Consequently, F doping endowed Cu/5FAC with more Lewis acid sites compared to Cu/AC. By analyzing the catalytic activity of undoped and F-doped catalysts in acetylene dimerization reaction, it was found that a minimal amount of F did not significantly improve the performance of the catalyst (Fig. 4 a). Meanwhile, the excessive F will reduce the conversion of acetylene. The conversion of acetylene reached its peak when the theoretical addition of F was 5 wt.%. Through the optimization of reaction conditions, the Cu/5FAC catalyst exhibited superior activity and stability compared to the undoped catalyst (Fig. 4 b and Figure S4). From Fig. 4 c, it was observed that the concentration of Lewis acid was closely correlated with catalytic activity. The catalytic activity of the catalyst increased with the increase of Lewis acid content. Fig. 4 d showed that the total acid content in the catalyst was mainly contributed by Lewis acid sites, therefore the Lewis acid sites introduced by F-doping were the fundamental reason for the improved catalytic activity. Additionally, previous studies have reported that Cu+ was the catalytic site for this reaction [16,18]. However, XPS analysis revealed that the F-doped catalyst contained less Cu+ but exhibited higher activity compared to the undoped catalyst. This fully demonstrated the positive effect of the Lewis acid sites introduced by F-doping on the reaction. The valence changes of copper in the catalyst before and after the reaction were shown in Fig. 5 a and Figure S 5a. These spectra exhibited two main peaks at approximately 933.3 and 935.4 eV, which corresponded to Cu0/Cu+ and Cu2+ species, respectively. Additionally, the satellite peaks were observed around 942.9 and 944.6 eV, which also corresponded to Cu0/Cu+ and Cu2+species, respectively [39,40]. The F doped Cu-based catalysts showed a higher Cu+ binding energy compared to the undoped catalysts. This indicated that F doping reduced the electron cloud density of Cu atoms while increasing the electron cloud density of F atoms around Cu atoms. This electronic effect between F and Cu atoms may generate new Lewis acid sites and effectively enhance catalytic activity. However, it should be noted that the Cu 2p3/2 spectrum alone cannot distinguish between Cu0 and Cu+ valence states due to their binding energies are only ±0.1 eV different. Therefore, to effectively analyze the species of Cu0 and Cu+, Cu LMM Auger analysis was used [41], as shown in Fig. 5 b and Figure S 5b. The patterns indicated that the peaks observed at approximately 915.9 eV represented Cu+ species, whereas the peaks detected at around 911.2 and 918.4 eV were associated with Cu transition and Cu0 species, respectively. In fresh catalyst without F doping contained 7.7 % Cu0, 31.3 % Cu+ and 61 % Cu2+ (Table 2 ). Comparatively, the fresh catalyst with F doping showed a decrease in Cu+ and Cu+/Cu2+ ratio. Moreover, comparing the fresh F doped catalyst to the used F doped catalyst, the Cu0 and Cu+ species increased after the reaction due to the reduction of Cu2+ or Cu+ to Cu0 and Cu+ by acetylene. Additionally, there was a higher amount of Cu+ in the used F doped catalyst compared to the used undoped Cu based catalyst, indicating that F doped could improve the stability of Cu+ in the reaction. Carbon deposition could cover the active sites and acid sites on the surface of catalyst, so it was necessary to test the anti-carbon deposition ability of F doping catalyst. In Fig. 6 c and d, the catalysts exhibited similar profiles within the temperature of 110–200 °C, which could be attributed to solvent desorption. In the temperature of 200 °C to 350 °C, the TG curves displayed a noticeable decline, indicating the decomposition of coke [42]. The F doped Cu-based catalyst showed a significant reduction in coke deposition compared to the undoped Cu-based catalyst, as calculated. This indicated that the introduction of F effectively enhanced the resistance to carbon deposition of catalyst. Furthermore, TEM images in Fig. 6 and Figure S6 revealed that the introduction of F element improved the dispersion of copper. Therefore, F doping reduced carbon deposition and enhanced the dispersion of Cu species, ultimately improved the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst. EDS mapping measurements indicated that the successful incorporation of F in AC by detecting changes in elemental contents. Additionally, to detect the effect of F doping on the stability of copper, the content of copper in the catalyst was measured. As depicted in Table 3 , F doped effectively improved the stability of copper in the catalyst, which may be due to the enhanced interaction between copper and the support. Fig. 7 a illustrated the adsorption energies of C2H2 on four different structures of Cu based catalysts (AC, FAC, FACOH, and FACCOOH), which were −10.47, −2.48, −1.78 and −1.7 kcal/moL, respectively. It could be observed that the interaction between the undoped Cu sites and C2H2 was stronger than F, -OH or COOH modified Cu sites. This stronger interaction will accelerate the polymerization of acetylene, resulting in the formation of high polymers. Consequently, more carbon deposits were generated in undoped catalyst. To explore the effect of F doping on C2H2 conversion, in situ DRIFTS was employed. As shown in Fig. 7 b and c, the broad peaks observed at approximately 3200–3350 cm−1 corresponded to the vibration of non-saturable CH bonds in acetylene [43]. Additionally, peaks observed in the ranges of 1250–1380 and 1630–1750 cm−1 were attributed to the vibration of C = C and CH in -CHCH2, respectively [44]. These specific peak patterns suggested the conversion of acetylene to MVA. The peaks observed at 2900–3000 cm−1 could be attributed to the vibration of -CH2 or -CH3 in longer chain hydrocarbons or alkanes, suggesting the formation of ethane or oligomer over the catalysts [44]. Over time, the intensity of -OH at 3400–3500 cm−1 in the undoped catalyst progressively increased. This could be attributed to the dissociation of acetylene and the consequent formation of terminal -OH (Fig. 7 b). This phenomenon was closely linked to the generation of H-bands between bridging -OH on AC and physically adsorbed C2H2 [45]. However, no vibration of hydroxyl groups was observed in F doped catalyst, which indicated that the adsorption effect of hydroxyl in Cu/5FAC was stronger than that in Cu/AC. And enhancing the concentration of acetylene around the active site has the potential to improve catalytic efficiency. 3 Conclusion In summary, this study focused on a cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach to prepare F-doped AC with abundant Lewis acid sites for the acetylene dimerization reaction. The bonding of F to C atoms created Lewis acid sites due to the difference in electronegativity. The resulting F-doped catalyst exhibited superior reactivity compared to undoped catalysts, highlighting the beneficial role of Lewis acid sites in enhancing catalytic activity. Theoretical calculations indicated that the introduction of F could help to alleviate the progression of polymers. This study not only presented a highly efficient solid acid catalyst for acetylene dimerization, but also proposed a strategy to enhance and control the surface acidity of activated carbon for other reactions.

        "dc:description": "Doping carbon-based materials with heteroatoms is considered an effective strategy to enhance their catalytic activity by altering their electronic structure and chemical properties. In this study, fluorine doped activated carbon was synthesized and used in acetylene dimerization reaction. Fluorine has the highest electronegativity (3.98) and can induce neighboring carbon atoms to possess a stronger positive charge, thereby generating Lewis acid sites between the two atoms. The resulting carbon material exhibited abundant Lewis acid sites ensuring the ample exposure and availability of catalytic sites to facilitate notable activity in acetylene dimerization. Theoretical calculations indicated that the introduction of F could help to alleviate the progression of polymers. This research provides a promising approach to the development of solid acid catalysts with excellent catalytic performance by incorporating Lewis acid sites onto carbon materials.",
