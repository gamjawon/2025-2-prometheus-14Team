Niezapominajek, 30-239 Cracow (Poland) (Received November 20, 1991; accepted November 10, 1992 ) Abstract The recently proposed supercluster model is applied to study the interaction between two molecules (atoms) adsorbed at the surface of a vanadium oxide catalyst. The results suggest that the interaction between adsorbed molecules via the catalyst may be particularly important for weakly chemisorbed species. For a pair of identical, weakly adsorbed molecules this interaction may (for some relative orientations) affect to some extent the conclusions obtained for a single admolecule, which may be of some relevance at high coverages. The interaction between unlike admolecules is normally expected to result in complete electron transfer to the molecule which is more strongly chemisorbed, but for some relative orientations of the two molecules substantial back donation may take place. This fact may have some consequences for the dependence of the reaction yield on reactant concentration. Key words: adsorbate-adsorbate interactions; finite supercluster model; vanadium oxide Introduction Most of the technologically important reactions catalyzed by solids (heterogeneous catalysis) involve at least two different reactants, e.g. oxygen (hydrogen) and the compound to be oxidized (hydrogenated). The catalyst itself may be engaged in various ways. For instance, it may act as a \"matrix\" by sterically confining the motion of the reactant molecules to mutual arrangements which favour the catalyzed reaction, or it may \"lend\" some of its atoms (e.g. oxygen) to a reactant at an early stage of the reaction, *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved. 342 P. Petelenz and E. Broclawik/J. Mol. Catal. 80 (1993) 341-352 and recover them later from other reactant (e.g. gaseous oxygen). There is also the interesting possibility [ 1,2 ] of the catalyst acting as a \"bridge\" for electron transfer between different reactant molecules adsorbed at the surface some distance apart. In this latter case, theoretical description of the process presents some difficulties. The effect is likely to depend strongly on the relative position of the reactant molecules adsorbed at the surface of the catalyst. This imposes obvious limitations for the quantum chemical cluster model [3-6], due to the prohibitively large size of the clusters that would have to be handled for some potentially important arrangements of the reagents, since even for relatively small distances between the two adatoms (admolecules) the calculations require an enormous computational effort [ 7 ] . At least for metal oxide catalysts, few attempts to tackle this problem have been made. In most calculations the influence of the catalyst on the reaction path was taken into account in an effective way by changing the number of electrons and/or the initial geometry of the reactants [8-12 ] . This approach could be applied as long as a direct encounter of the reactant molecules on the surface was assumed, which would not be the case if the role of the catalyst as a bridge for electron transfer between the reactants were to be explored. In order to assess the ability of a catalyst to act in this capacity, its direct inclusion in the calculations seems inevitable. In recent calculations [ 7 ] an attempt was made to extend the model cluster to a size sufficient to accommodate two adatoms, along with part of the surface deemed necessary to account for the main features of a vanadium oxide catalyst. That approach, based on the semiempirical SINDO method, is potentially capable of handling the \"electron bridge\" effects. However, even for relatively small distances between the reactants the size of the model clusters is likely to become prohibitively large; at the very least, the calculations are bound to become very time consuming. At this stage, a simpler approach which suggests those reactants and those arrangements of reactants at the vanadia surface which would be promising enough to warrant an extensive numerical study would be useful. It should also allow, be it at a lower level of accuracy, those cases in which large size of the model cluster would preclude the application of the SINDO method. In Part I [ 13 ] of this series, we proposed a supercluster model, where the results of the SINDO calculations, performed for small clusters, are used as input data for the description of a much larger fragment of the catalyst surface. At that time, the supercluster was assumed to contain only one admolecule (adatom). Here we generalize the treatment to include two (or more) admolecules. The model Our model represents the surface of a vanadia catalyst as a finite, two dimensional set of VOS pyramids (supercluster), with periodic boundary con- P. Petelenz and E. Broclawik/J. Mol. Catal. 80 (1993) 341-352 343 ditions. The model Hamiltonian and the method of parameter evaluation from SINDO semi-empirical calculations have been described in detail [ 13 ] . Originally [ 13 ] , the model allowed one of the structural units of the set to be different from the others*. The difference (in the orbital energy of the electron), attributed to the presence of an adsorbed molecule, was estimated from the results of SINDO calculations. The only novel aspect of the present version is the allowance for two or more \"impurities\", i.e., two or more molecules adsorbed at the surface. In general, each molecule may be different from the others, giving rise to different \"impurities\"; their positions in the supercluster can be arbitrarily set. In the present paper we focus our attention on the case of two impurities. This model should account qualitatively for the most salient features of the indirect interaction between the adsorbed molecules via the catalyst. The purpose of this study is twofold. Firstly, before going into the details of the interaction between unlike species (which is probably most intriguing from the point of view of potential catalytic applications), it seems reasonable to examine pairs of identical molecules. In fact, the model described in Part I [ 13 ] is obviously relevant in the limit of small coverage (one admolecule per supercluster of 100 to 300 structural units). At greater coverage, the probability that a molecule is adsorbed relatively close to another may be large. The obvious question is, to what extent does the interaction via the catalyst affect the conclusions drawn for an isolated admolecule? Secondly, pairs of unlike molecules have been investigated in order to gauge the ability of vanadium oxide surface to act as a bridge for electron transfer between reactants. Calculations We have performed supercluster calculations for 10 different arrangements of two adsorption sites on the surface of the vanadia catalyst. Four models labelled 0,1, 2, 3, were chosen for studying the interaction along the \"a\" direction of the catalyst surface, five models (A-E) have been used to mimic the interaction in the \"c\" direction and finally model F is an attempt to describe the interaction along the diagonal, across the empty space (structural cavity) on the surface (see Fig. 1). The pairs of adsorbates have been selected from the set studied in Part I [ 13 ] based on their relative donor-acceptor properties and the degree of electron transfer between the adsorbate and the surface. The two hydrogen atoms represent the case of a strongly chemisorbed species, or in technical terms a *In terms of solid state theory, this structural unit could be considered as an \"impurity\" in an otherwise ideal two dimensional crystal. 344 P.

Two NO molecules represent the opposite limit - a weakly localised impurity with a shallow impurity-to-cluster donor level. In addition to homomolecular adsorbate pairs, heteromolecular pairs are also considered in order to examine the possibility of electron transfer between different adsorbates, with the catalyst acting as a bridge between the reactants. In the NO-H pair the difference in donor character is large, whereas the species engaged in the NO-OZ pair exhibit similar donor properties towards the vanadium-oxygen surface. The relevant energetic and localisation parameters for the molecules mentioned above (as calculated [ 13 ] ) are compiled in Table 1. The second column of the table lists the positions of the electron-accepting energy level of a single vanadia pyramid with the molecule adsorbed on top of it, obtained from SINDO calculations. This energy is a measure of the strength of the adsorbate bond to the surface, and of its donor character. The next two columns list some of the results of the supercluster calcu- P. Petelenz and E.

As a measure of the degree of electron delocalisation between the adsorbing unit and the rest of the solid, column 3 shows the charge remaining on the one-pyramid supercluster building unit to which the adsorbate species is attached. Finally, the last column lists the position of the lowest supercluster state relative to the bottom of the supercluster pseudoband. The results of the supercluster calculations for two homomolecular impurities ( [ H ] 2, [ NO ] 2) and two heteromolecular pairs ( [ NO-0219 [ NO-H ] ) are given in Tables 2-5 for the ten geometric models specified earlier. The distribution of the charge across the two dimensional supercluster has been obtained from the simple population analysis described in Part I [ 13 ] . In the case of homomolecular pairs each adsorbed molecule is assumed to contribute one electron so that ultimately two extra electrons are allocated to the supercluster levels. The assumed symmetry of the vanadia supercluster and adsorption geometry do not allow for exact degeneracy of the energy levels (only one dimensional irreducible representations can appear). However, a large enough distance between two identical adsorbate molecules leads to the splitting of the two lowest levels smaller than 0.0001 eV, so that they have to be regarded as practically degenerate. In the case of heteromolecular pairs the degeneracy of the two lowest states is never even approached. In that case, one extra electron is allocated to the lowest supercluster state and its distribution over the surface, in particular over the two adsorption centres, is examined. Homomolecular pairs Tables 2 and 3 show the results of the calculations for a pair of adsorbed NO molecules and for a pair of adsorbed hydrogen atoms, respectively. In the second columns of the tables the charge on one of the two impurity units (ex- 346 P. Petelenz and E. Broclawik/J. Mol. Catal. 80 (1993) 341-352 actly the same as on the other impurity unit) is listed for the ten geometric models under consideration. One can see that the close vicinity of the second impurity of the same type increases the charge located at the adsorption centre. Accordingly, the delocalisation of the charge over the surface decreases as coverage increases. The effect, however, diminishes quickly as the distance between adsorbates increases, and even for the strongly interacting NO molecules it is negligible for coverages of less than 5% * (more than 2 units separating the adsorbates). Comparison of Tables 2 and 3 shows clearly that in the case of hydrogen adsorption the overall effect is much smaller, and that it practically disappears when more than one supercluster unit separates the impurities. The last three columns list the positions of the three lowest supercluster levels; the linear combination coefficients which weight the contribution of the impurity wavefunction to the corresponding eigenvector of the supercluster, are given in parentheses. The energies of the states are measured relative to the bottom of the supercluster pseudo-band. It is readily seen that for a pair of NO molecules the splitting of the two adsorbate states in the field of the supercluster becomes so large that the higher level enters the pseudo-band. This happens for the cases A and 0 where the interaction between impurities is large, and is a consequence of the fact that the impurity state for an isolated (single) impurity lies very close to the bottom of the pseudo-band (dE=0.036 eV).

In other cases, where both impurity levels lie below the pseudo-band, the increase of the charge on the impurity unit is not more than a few percent. In the case of hydrogen, the energy gap between the local level corresponding to an isolated adatom and the band, is so large (0.381 eV) that for twohydrogen adsorption, the H-H interaction is never strong enough to mix Significantly the impurity states with the supercluster states. In effect, the largest increase of the charge on the impurity unit resulting from the H-H interaction via the supercluster, amounts to 9%. The results discussed above suggest that the surface of the catalyst cannot act as an efficient bridge in impurity-impurity charge transfer unless the impurity state is very close in energy to the catalyst band. The comparison of the impurity-impurity interaction along different directions at the vanadia (010) surface supplies another general conclusion. The interaction is stronger along the \"c\" direction than along the \"a\" direction. Clearly, of all the impurity pairs studied, the most pronounced effect is found for model A, the interaction along the \"c\" direction. It also decreases with the distance more slowly than along the \"a\" direction. It is noteworthy that for some relative arrangements of the two adatoms (admolecules) the effect is opposite, i.e. (slightly) enhanced delocalisation is observed. Cases D and E for the NO homomolecular pairs and cases B, C, D and 2 for the H pairs exhibit some decrease of the charge on the impurity unit. As should have been expected, for large enough inter-impurity distances this charge approaches the value obtained from the supercluster model for an isolated impurity. 348 P. Petelenz and E. Broclaruik/J Mol. Catal. 80 (1993) 341-352 Heteromolecular pairs Inspection of Tables 4 and 5 leads to the conclusion that for most geometries the transfer of the electron from adsorbed NO to adsorbed H and O2, is practically complete. Evidently, the catalyst acts as a perfect bridge for electron transfer. This situation could have been foreseen based on Table 1 alone, and the present results do not provide much new insight. However, for some geometries the results deviate from this general trend. The deviations are the most conspicuous for the NO-02 pair where the difference in donor character between the adsorbed species is small and at the same time the \"impurity\" state generated by NO lies close to the pseudo-band of the supercluster. In that case, for some arrangements of the adsorbed molecules TABLE 4 Results of the calculations for the [ (NO) (OZ) ] pair adsorbed at the superclustere Case p, (NO) (e) p2(OZ) (e) 0 0.133 0.562 1 0.001 0.623 2 0.001 0.623 3 0.001 0.623 A 0.205 0.533 B 0.017 0.603 C 0.001 0.623 D 0.001 0.623 E 0.001 0.623 F 0.062 0.574 Hp; (X) -electron charge at the site where the X molecule is adsorbed, X - NO, O2.

P. Petelenz and E. Broclawik/J. Mol. Catal. 80 (1993) 341-352 349 the electron density is no longer strongly localized at the structural unit to which 02 is attached - its substantial fraction remains on the pyramid hosting NO. This effect may be interpreted as \"back donation\" from OZ to NO, mediated by the states from the supercluster pseudo-band which mix significantly with the higher (NO) impurity level. Like for homomolecular pairs, the strongest effect is observed for model A (along the \"c\" direction); the NO centre acquires over 50% of the charge it would have if NO were the only molecule adsorbed at the surface. The effect is halved when the molecules are located at neighbouring sites along the \"a\" direction (case 0 ), and in other cases the charge is localized solely at the unit to which the 02 molecule is bound. For NO-H coadsorption the effect is very small as a rule and the charge is strongly localized at the unit where the hydrogen atom is adsorbed. This suggests the general conclusion that \"back donation\" from the \"deeper\" (induced by the more strongly chemisorbed species) to the \"shallower\" impurity level may be mediated by the interaction with the catalyst band (\"electron bridge effect\"), when the donor-acceptor character of the reactants does not differ too much and when the molecules are bound to the surface with only moderate strength, so that the relevant electronic state of the host VOS pyramids is not too strongly perturbed by chemisorption. In that case, electron transfer from the impurity with a strong tendency for electron localization towards the impurity with weak localization ability may occur. The results presented above might give some clues as to the optimum conditions for reactions in which the catalyst is supposed to act as a bridge for electrons. They have to be differentiated depending on whether the primary reaction step involves the flow of electrons from a \"shallower\" to a \"deeper\" donor, or vice versa*. In the former case, if both reactants are strongly chemisorbed, their distance at the surface is irrelevant: the electrons will always flow from the less strongly to the more strongly chemisorbed molecule. In that case, for obvious statistical reasons high concentrations of the reactants at the surface (high coverage) will favour the reaction. If the reactants are weakly chemisorbed, at high concentrations the effects of back donation will diminish the reaction yield. At some concentration these effects may start to prevail; in that case, further increase of the coverage may result in a decrease of the reaction yield. For reactions where electron flow from the more strongly to the less strongly chemisorbed species is desirable (from the deeper to the shallower impurity level), and both reactants are strongly chemisorbed, the reaction yield is expected to be marginal. Consequently, the catalyst in hand is not suitable, and another one (where chemisorption would be weaker) has to be applied. \"The latter would be the case e.g. for electron transfer from a hydrocarbon molecule to oxygen [8,9]. 350 P. Petelenz and E. Brocfawik/J Mol. Catal. 80 (1993) 341-352 If the reactants are weakly chemisorbed, the effects of back donation will favour the reaction. In that case, the reaction yield is expected to increase considerably at high coverages. Shortcomings and perspectives of the model The above suggestions regarding the choice of optimum conditions for \"electron-bridge catalysis\" must be treated with extreme caution, befitting a model which at the moment has no experimental confirmation. The supercluster methodology provides a computationally feasible and conceptually appealing framework in which to examine some general trends, with a reasonable chance of realizing potentially useful applications. As with any simple model, it cannot be used blindly and its results must be treated with some reservation. This follows from the model's inherent limitations. An obvious physical limitation is a consequence of the fact that the model ignores the disorder introduced by thermal motion and the coupling with phonons. This tends to destroy the phase coherence of the wave functions, thereby favouring electron localization, and suppresses the \"electron bridge mechanism\" for large distances between the reactant molecules. The interaction with phonons might be accounted for in an approximate way, in the limit of weak vibronic coupling: the electron transfer integrals in the supercluster would have to be renormalized by vibrational overlap factors. Once the eigenstates of the supercluster are calculated, thermal disorder could be introduced by averaging over a set of fractionally occupied states, weighted according to their Boltzmann factors. Obviously, the limiting case of very strong vibronic coupling, where both of the above effects combine to result in electron self-trapping, could not be handled without a major extension of the theoretical framework. However, this drawback of the present model is common to all other quantum chemical approaches based on the adiabatic approximation. In addition to the basic physical assumptions underlying the supercluster approach there is a set of more or less technical limitations. The essence of the supercluster approach consists in splitting the extremely complex problem of the interaction of a molecule with an (infinite) surface into two simpler problems: on the one hand, that of calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the supercluster and analysing the results, and on the other hand that of generating the input parameters for the supercluster Hamiltonian by doing quantum chemical calculations for small clusters. Accordingly, the shortcomings of the approach can be divided into two groups: those that can be removed without affecting the basic stratagem (splitting into two stages) and those that cannot. The obvious limitation belonging to the second group is concerned with geometry optimization. P. Petelenz and E. Broctawik/J. Mol. Catal. 80 (1993) 341-352 351 When a molecule is adsorbed, the primary question is what is its equilibrium distance from the surface. In our approach, its optimization was done in a crude but effective way [ 13 ] . However, due to the change of the electronic structure upon adsorption (which is included in our treatment), some changes of the geometry, both of the molecule and of the surface should follow. Those for the surface are likely to extend to more distant structural units, each unit being differently affected by the presence of the admolecule. If explicitly included in the theory, the calculations at the stage of individual structural units (clusters) would be coupled with those at the supercluster stage, thereby preventing the separation which is the basic premise of our approach. Therefore, the physical relevance of the present approach depends on how far from the admolecule the major geometric changes of the surface really reach. Intuitively, one supposes that they should be fairly localized. If that is the case, the most prominent geometric changes may be included in the calculations without disrupting the general scheme. Although the implementation of the SINDO method we have used [ 14 ] does not allow geometry optimization, there are no basic obstacles to include it in future versions. Then, the major geometric changes in the admolecule as well as in its immediate neighbourhood at the surface would be automatically included in the effective energetic parameters that are the input for the supercluster stage of the calculations. The first step in that direction might consist in relaxing the constraints on the position of the atom to which the admolecule is directly bound, while fixing the positions of the atoms located at the corners of the small cluster under consideration (in order to mimic the rigidity of the solid matrix). Then, the geometry changes would be neglected only for more distant atoms which are only indirectly perturbed by the admolecule. It is reasonable to expect the range of the geometric perturbation of the surface to be larger only for relatively strong chemisorption, i.e., just for the cases where the conclusions of the present approach are of less interest (vide supra). Other limitations of the present approach seem to belong to the first group and in principle are less difficult to eliminate. The use of the SINDO method to estimate the input parameters for the supercluster Hamiltonian was motivated by the success of that semi-empirical method in the description of surface phenomena [ 14 ] . However, any other quantum chemical method (even ab initio) can be used for this purpose. The general advantage of the proposed manner of extracting the parameters from the results of the quantum chemical calculations consists in the fact that the relevant information is gathered from the differences of energies calculated for similar systems (a V05 pyramid perturbed by an admolecule us. a bare pyramid; a pair of interacting us. a pair of non-interacting pyramids); consequently, there is a good chance that most of the systematic errors inherent to any particular method (semi-empirical or not) cancel out. 352 P. Petelenz and E. Brocfawik/J Mol. Catal. 80 (1993) 341-352 An obvious shortcoming consists in the neglect of electron correlation. In this sense, the model is analogous to the Mickel and Ising models. Presumably, the numerical parameters implicitly account for some correlation effects, but explicit inclusion of electron-electron repulsion would probably reduce the tendency for electron localization. In addition the effects due to different spin multiplicities of the eigenstates are evidently beyond our present scope. There are no fundamental obstacles to extend the present approach by including electron correlation in some rudimentary form, e.g. analogous to the Hubbard model. While for small distances between reactants the semiempirical SINDO calculations may in the future become a feasible (and more accurate) alternative to the present form of the supercluster model, they are unlikely to go beyond the SCF level for systems of comparable size, so that the extension mentioned above might turn the supercluster approach into a useful tool to probe the effects of electron correlation. We have postponed studies of this kind until more experience is gained with the present simple version of supercluster methodology.

Niezapominajek, 30-239 Cracow Poland The recently proposed supercluster model is applied to study the interaction between two molecules (atoms) adsorbed at the surface of a vanadium oxide catalyst. The results suggest that the interaction between adsorbed molecules via the catalyst may be particularly important for weakly chemisorbed species. For a pair of identical, weakly adsorbed molecules this interaction may (for some relative orientations) affect to some extent the conclusions obtained for a single admolecule, which may be of some relevance at high coverages. The interaction between unlike admolecules is normally expected to result in complete electron transfer to the molecule which is more strongly chemisorbed, but for some relative orientations of the two molecules substantial back donation may take place. This fact may have some consequences for the dependence of the reaction yield on reactant concentration.
