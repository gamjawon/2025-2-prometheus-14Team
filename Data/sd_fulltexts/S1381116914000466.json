Graphical abstract Catalytic decarboxylation and further conversion of oleic acid to branched and aromatic hydrocarbons in a single process step, over Pt–SAPO-11 and Pt/chloride Al2O3 is presented. An increase of both reaction time and temperature increase the selectivity to heptadecane. Higher selectivity to heptadecane was observed in the presence of hydrogen. Decarboxylation of oleic acid was as high as ∼98wt% (selectivity for heptadecane >30%) at 325°C in the presence of hydrogen. Branched isomers, alkyl aromatics, like dodecyl benzene and cracked (<C17) paraffins were the other products. Keywords Fatty acid decarboxylation Fatty acid isomerization Unsaturated fatty acids Fuel hydrocarbons Bifunctional catalyst 1 Introduction Biofuel production technologies have recently received considerable attention as CO2 emission of biofuels is lower compared to conventional fuels when the whole life cycle of the fuels is taken into account [1]. Some of the sources of biofuels are natural oils and fats (e.g., animal fats, plant and seed oils). They are complex mixtures of triglycerides, which are fatty acid esters of glycerol. The carbon chain lengths of the fatty acids range from about C8 to C24, but C12, C16, and C18 fatty acids tend to be the most abundant [2]. Removing oxygen from fatty acids (deoxygenation) leads to the formation of paraffinic hydrocarbons that can potentially serve as or be converted to direct replacements (‘drop-in fuels’) for traditional petroleum-derived liquid transportation fuels and paraffinic petrochemical feedstocks [3]. There is considerable interest in producing hydrocarbons from triglycerides because hydrocarbon molecules offer advantages over other alternative transport fuels such as hydrogen, biogas and carbohydrate fuels [4]. Several possible reaction paths for production of straight-chain hydrocarbons from fatty acids are available. Deoxygenation of unsaturated fatty acids are accomplished via hydrogenation of double bonds and further through direct removal of the carboxyl group by releasing carbon dioxide and producing a paraffinic hydrocarbon (decarboxylation) or by releasing carbon monoxide and producing an olefinic hydrocarbon (decarbonylation) [5–8]. Intensive studies on liquid phase deoxygenation of free fatty acids and fatty acid esters have been carried out [7–12]. Metals such as Ni, Ni/Mo, Ru, Pd, Pd/Pt, Pt, Ir, Os and Rh supported on different supports have been evaluated for their deoxygenation performance. Pd supported on carbon was one of the earliest catalysts for the deoxygenation of stearic acid [7–12]. Fatty acids, like oleic and stearic acids, when contacted with solid catalysts (like Pd/C) tend to deoxygenate to heptadecane under elevated temperatures and pressures. Hydrocarbons are produced also by thermolysis of vegetable oils over metal oxide catalysts; however, large amount of cracking to lower molecular weight hydrocarbons has been observed during thermolysis [13–16]. In heterogeneously-catalyzed reactions, the nature of the carrier gas or solvent is expected to influence the conversion and selectivity values. Maier et al. [17] deoxygenated aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids over Pd/SiO2 and Ni/Al2O3 catalysts at 330°C in different environments (H2 or N2) in the gas phase and found that the presence of hydrogen is desirable to maintain stable catalytic activity during the decarboxylation reaction although the role of hydrogen is not apparent from the stoichiometry of the decarboxylation reaction. In contrast, no reaction occurred in a nitrogen atmosphere. Snare et al. [8] conducted liquid phase deoxygenation experiments in a continuous flow reactor under Ar and H2 atmosphere and solvent-free conditions using a Pd/C catalyst. The formation of hydrocarbons, mainly olefins and aromatics, were below 10mol%. Representative examples of catalysts employed for the conversion of stearic acid to heptadecane include selenium [18], complexes of Pd and Rh [19], and Pd–C [20]. However, in these studies, the yield to heptadecane or stearic acid conversion was low. Research related to the conversion of saturated fatty acids, such as stearic acid, to straight chain hydrocarbon is well-documented [21]. Some studies of the decarboxylation of the unsaturated oleic acid have also been reported [8,22–25]. In most of the above studies, the support for the metal has been catalytically inert material (like carbon) or relatively, non-acidic components, like silica or non-acidic alumina. The influence of stronger acidic supports in modifying the carbon skeleton of the linear C16–C18 paraffins (initial products of the decarboxylation of the fatty acid), by isomerization, cracking, cyclisation, hydrocracking etc., had not been explored. Biodiesels, fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) are produced from vegetable oils or triglycerides of other biological origin by transesterification with alcohols (generally methanol) and are mainly used as renewable diesel fuel components. But these have several disadvantages e.g. high pour points, depositions in the fuel system and the combustion chamber; lower storage stability (oxidation and heat degradation) because of the olefinic double bonds; aptitude to water intake and hydrolysis sensitivity of the ester bonds, which generates corrosive acids. Consequently, in the EU the maximum blending quantity of the fatty acid methyl esters is limited to 7.0v/v% according to EN 59 0:2009 standard. To satisfy the application requirements of the diesel vehicles hydrocarbons with different conformation (paraffin mixtures) should be produced from triglycerides and fatty acids. As these normal paraffin (mainly n-C12 to n-C-20) mixtures have high cetane number, they have excellent performance. On the other hand, the pour point of these paraffin mixtures is high so their structure should be modified to fulfill the requirements of the diesel blending components (the pour point should be below 5°C). For this purpose the catalytic isomerization of the normal to isoparaffins is, often, used to lower their pour points [26,27]. Hydroisomerization reactions of normal paraffins are carried out in the presence of the bi-functional catalysts. The degree of isomerization, the product yield and composition are significantly affected by the properties of the used catalyst (acidity, surface area and pore size distribution), the applied operational parameters (temperature and pressure). Isomerization takes place in high degree in the presence of different noble metal (such as Pd and Pt) containing zeolites (ZSM-5, ZSM-22), mesoporous structures (MCM-41, Al-MCM-41) and silica-alumina-phosphates (SAPO-11, SAPO-31, SAPO-41) as they have mild acidity [27]. Some catalysts like SAPO-11, SAPO-31, SAPO-41 were found to be favorable for the isomerization of long chain paraffins [29]. Isomerization of paraffins over Pt–SAPO-11, Pd–SAPO-11, Pt–SAPO-5 have been reported in the literature [27–31]. If the deoxygenation of the fatty acid and subsequent isomerization/hydrocracking of the resulting C17–C18 linear paraffins to branched, gasoline-range C5–C10 hydrocarbons with lower pour points and higher octane numbers can be accomplished by a bifunctional catalyst in a single reactor, it will represent a significant advance in the process of conversion of lipid biomass material to ‘drop-in’ hydrocarbon transport fuels, like motor and aviation gasoline. We report the catalytic decarboxylation of oleic acid and further conversion of the resulting product linear paraffins over bifunctional Pt/SAPO-11 and Pt–acidic, chloride, alumina catalysts in a single process stage. The direct, single stage conversion of fatty acids to branched and aromatic hydrocarbons (especially, the industrially important dodecylbenzene) over a single, bi-functional catalyst has not, so far, been reported. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization 5wt% Pt/SAPO-11 catalysts were prepared by conventional dry impregnation of SAPO-11 samples with platinum nitrate solutions. Similarly, 5wt% Pt–alumina was prepared by dry impregnation of acidic, chlorided alumina with platinum nitrate solution. The catalysts, both fresh and spent, were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption (BET) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). XRD patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer at 40kV and 40mA with Cu Kα radiation. BET surface areas and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were collected in a Micromeritics Tristar-3000 porosimeter at 77K using liquid nitrogen as coolant. Before measurements, the catalyst was degassed at 150°C for 3h. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to inspect the morphology of Pt/SAPO 11. TEM images were taken on Technai F20 FEI TEM using a field emission gun, operating with an accelerating voltage of 200kV. 2.2 Reaction procedure Oleic acid (90%, Alfa-Aesar) was used as the unsaturated fatty acid. Pt/SAPO-11 was pre-activated in the oven for 3h at 150°C. The decarboxylation reactions were conducted in a 250ml stainless steel, high pressure autoclave batch reactor (Parr model 4576A). Oleic acid and Pt/SAPO-11 were loaded into the reactor with a mass ratio of 18:1. Before the reaction started, the air in the reactor was removed by flushing with CO2 or H2. The pressure was increased to the desired reaction pressure (usually 20bar). Under constant stirring conditions, the reactor was heated at a rate of 10°C/min to the reaction temperature (200–325°C) and this temperature was kept constant during the reaction. Reaction of oleic acid with Pt–alumina was carried out in a similar manner. After the reaction, the catalyst particles were separated, by filtration, from the liquid product and washed with acetone for further characterization. 2.3 Product analysis The liquid phase product withdrawn from the reactor was analyzed with a gas chromatograph (GC, 7820 A) equipped with a HP-5 MS column (with dimensions of 30m×250μm×0.25μm) and a 5975 MSD detector. Samples were silylated with N,O-bis(trimethyl)-trifloroacetamide, BSTFA (Acros organics, 98%) before the GC analysis. After addition of the silylation agent, the samples were kept at 60°C for 1h. A sample of 0.2μL was injected into the GC column (225°C, 10.5psi) with a split ratio 20:1, and the carrier gas (helium) flow rate was 1mL/min. The following temperature program of the gas chromatograph was used for analysis: 100°C for 5min, 300°C (20°C/min, for 2min). Quantitative analysis was accomplished by generating and using calibration curves for each compound of interest. The product identification was confirmed with a gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer (GC–MS). The decarboxylation conversion of the oleic acid was estimated from the reduction in the number of oleic acid carboxylic acid groups during the reaction. The amount of carboxylic acid groups remaining in the products after the reaction was evaluated by quantifying the acid number (ASTMD974). Acid number is the mass of potassium hydroxide (KOH) in milligrams that is required to neutralize one gram of chemical substance. To quantify the acid number, a known amount of sample (about 0.1g) is dissolved in a solvent (ethanol+Petroleum ether), then titrated with a solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 0.1N) using phenolphthalein as a color indicator. The acid number is calculated from this equation: Acid number = 56.1 N V W where N =0.1 (N); V =volume of NaOH consumed (ml); W =mass of the sample (g). The decarboxylation % was calculated using the acid number of oleic acid and acid number of the product using the following relation: % Decarboxylation=(acid number of oleic acid−acid number of the product)/acid number of oleic acid×100%. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1a shows a representative TEM image of the Pt/SAPO-11 catalyst employed in this study. High density of well-dispersed platinum nanoparticles on SAPO-11 support are observed. The Pt particle histogram in Fig. 1b, shows a high fraction of very small nanoparticles (1–3nm). However, the size distribution is relatively broad, with some particles reaching diameters of ∼8nm. The surface area and average pore volume of the fresh catalyst was 153m2/g and 0.53cc/g respectively. The surface area for SAPO-11 was 205m2/g. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the fresh catalyst (supporting information) displayed type I isotherms typical of microporous phases as defined by IUPAC. The XRD pattern of the fresh catalyst (supporting information) corresponded to the AEL topology, a typical structure of SAPO-11 [32]. Fig. 2 shows the decarboxylation of oleic acid over Pt–SAPO-11 as a function of temperature and carrier gas (H2 or CO2). Decarboxylation is defined as: [(acid number of feed−acid number of product)/acid number of feed]×100. Decarboxylation, as expected, increased with reaction temperature for a given reaction time [6,18,33]. Decarboxylation in the presence of H2 is higher compared to CO2, in part because, in the presence of H2, the dominant reactions are decarboxylation of the COOH group as well as hydrogenation of the double bond in oleic acid to stearic acid, the latter undergoing a more facile decarboxylation. When CO2 is used as the only carrier gas hydrogen, needed for the hydrogenation of the double bond has to be provided through hydrogen re-distribution reactions (dehydrogenation of the feed molecules, for example). The accumulation of large quantities of olefins and diolefins on the catalyst during the decarboxylation also causes the formation of oligomers and polymers which deactivate the catalyst leading to the lower conversions in the absence of H2. An additional route for the removal of the COOH group in the presence of hydrogen is via hydrogenation of the COOH group to CH2OH and the subsequent dehydration of this alcohol and hydrogenation of the resulting terminal olefin to the corresponding paraffin. This additional route for decarboxylation is not available in the absence of H2. The highest degree of decarboxylation was observed at 325°C in the presence of H2. Above 325°C, significant amounts of cracked products (C1–C6 hydrocarbons) are formed in addition to the isomerized, long chain products. It may be noted in Fig. 2 that the percentage decarboxylation has a sharp increase at 200–250°C in H2 environment and at 250–300°C in CO2 environment. In the presence of H2, oleic acid is first hydrogenated to stearic acid which then undergoes facile decarboxylation, at 250–300°C. In the absence of H2, this low temperature hydrogenation route is not available and the thermal decarboxylation of the unsaturated acid is the only route available. This route, however, requires a higher temperature, above 300°C). The acid number of the products (indicative of the concentration of unconverted oleic acid) over Pt–SAPO-11 in the presence of H2 and CO2 decreased as temperature increased (Table S1). Fig. 3 shows the influence of temperature on selectivity to heptadecane, the linear C17 paraffin obtained by the decarboxylation of oleic acid in the presence of H2 and CO2. Heptadecane selectivity increased with temperature, and was favored in a H2 environment. As shown in Fig. 4 stearic acid was formed by hydrogenation of oleic acid and then underwent decarboxylation to form heptadecane. The other components in the product included branched paraffins formed by isomerization of the heptadecane, aromatics formed by cyclisation and aromatization (like dodecyl benzene) and lower molecular weight hydrocarbons (mostly C6–C16 paraffins) formed by cracking of the heptadecane. The detailed product distribution is given in Table 1 . When oleic acid was reacted with Pt–acidic, chlorided alumina at 250°C and 20bar H2 pressure for 2h, the extent of decarboxylation was 97.5% and there was negligible unsaturation in the products (low iodine number). Selectivity to heptadecane was 62.7% and products due to isomerization and hydrocracking were also observed. Products due to isomerization (iso-C18 =6.8wt%) from linear, paraffin, C18H38, formed from C18H37COOH present as an impurity in commercial oleic acid) and hydrocracking (C16 =23.8wt%) were also observed. The balance was C3–C4 hydrocarbons. Similar results were also got when palmitic acid was used instead of oleic acid. For example, at 300° C, 20bar pressure and a reaction time of 2h, the decarboxylation of palmitic acid over Pt–alumina was 94.6% and selectivity to pentadecane was 28%. Hydrocarbons boiling in the diesel range (C10–C16) were 67.7%, hydrocarbons boiling in the gasoline range (C5–C9) were 16.3wt%, and the balance was mostly hydrocarbons in the C3–C9 range. There were negligible quantities of the hydrogenolysis products, methane and ethane. The surface area for chloride alumina support was 198m2/g. For the Pt–chloride alumina catalyst the surface area decreased to 179m2/g). Table 2 compares the performance of our Pt–SAPO-11 catalysts with other solid catalysts reported in the literature. The Pt/SAPO-11 catalyst displayed better catalytic performance as compared to the Pt and Pd based catalysts as well as to the conventional Pd/activated carbon. In principle Pt nanoparticles are expected to be, relatively, more uniformly dispersed in supports (like SAPO-11) having unimodal pore sizes. This better dispersion leads to a higher surface area and, thereby, to a better catalytic performance. The higher selectivity to heptadecane with Pt–acidic, chlorided alumina was likely related to the low acidity of alumina compared to SAPO-11. Recyclability and long catalyst life are important pre-requisites for any catalyst to be considered for potential industrial applications. Therefore, we evaluated the catalytic performance of the spent catalyst at 325°C, 20bar, 120min under H2 and CO2 environments. In the recycle experiments, the catalyst, after use in the reaction, was washed with acetone, air-dried, and heated at 300°C for 6h before reuse. The degree of decarboxylation decreased from ∼98% (fresh) to ∼91% (recycled) when hydrogen was the carrier gas. In CO2, decarboxylation decreased from ∼94 (fresh) to 89% (recycled). Fig. S2 shows that the XRD pattern of the fresh Pt–SAPO-11 catalyst is preserved even after use. This suggests that SAPO-11 do not become significantly amorphous after reaction. However, the decrease in intensity of most of the XRD peaks of the spent catalyst (as compared to the fresh one) may indicate either (1) significant coverage of the surface by carbonaceous material in the reaction mixture which are not removed during the recycle or (2) a lowering of the degree of crystallinity of the SAPO-11 and alumina phases. Since the catalytic activity could be restored after an air regeneration (burning off the coke in air above 400°C, we believe that formation of hard coke which is not removed by the solvent acetone used in our recycle procedure was the major cause of the lower activity after catalyst recycle. ICP analysis of the reaction mixture indicated that there was no significant leaching of the Pt phase during use. The XRD spectra of the recycled catalysts both in hydrogen and CO2 environments (Fig. S2) confirm that the Pt/SAPO-11 structure was preserved after recycling. However, the BET surface area decreased from 153m2/g (for the fresh catalyst) to 112m2/g (spent catalyst) when hydrogen was used in the reaction and to 98m2/g when CO2 was used. This decrease in surface area is, probably, due to blockage of the micropores in the recycled catalysts due to formation of carbonaceous material. The lower surface area of the recycled samples supports this hypothesis and may partially explain the slight decrease in activity of the recycled catalysts. 4 Conclusions The decarboxylation and further conversion of oleic acid and palmitic acid to gasoline/diesel-range hydrocarbons has been demonstrated over bifunctional catalysts, Pt/SAPO-11 and Pt–chlorided alumina. The degree of decarboxylation and selectivity to the primary intermediate, the linear heptadecane are affected by reaction temperature, time and environment (H2 or CO2). Higher temperatures, longer reaction times, and the presence of hydrogen increased the degree of decarboxylation (as high as 98%) and selectivity to heptadecane (up to ∼63%). In the presence of acidic supports, like SAPO-11 or chlorided alumina, the initially formed paraffin intermediate undergoes further conversion to branched, cyclic and alkyl aromatic hydrocarbons. For example, dodecylbenzene, of high interest in the petrochemical industry as a raw material for detergents, could be obtained in high yields. Under appropriate reaction conditions, significant quantities of hydrocarbons boiling in the gasoline range could also be formed by hydrocracking reactions over these bifunctional catalysts.
