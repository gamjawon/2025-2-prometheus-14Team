The catalytic activities and the product distributions of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide over C04_ uSi02 and Co,-,Rh,/Si02 catalysts (where n = 0-4) and (Co, + Ru4)/Si0z and(C04 + Rh4)/Si02 catalysts derived from the transition-metal carbonyl clusters were compared. Activities were highest for the catalysts derived from homometallic clusters, and lowest for catalysts with 1:1 ratio of Co/Ru or Co/Rh. Interestingly enough, the highly active homometallic cobalt catalyst was the most resistant to deactivation. On Co4_hSi02 catalysts the deactivation was stronger on bimetallic sites and on the Coo-uSi02 catalysts the deactivation was closely related to the presence of ruthenium. The selectivities for oxygenated compounds were clearly promoted by the bimetallic sites of Co-Rh catalysts. This result is very plausible since the probability to find dual active sites responsible for the formation of oxygenates is greater in bimetallic than in homometallic catalysts.

Introduction Transition-metal clusters have been under intensive investigation in view of their potential both as models for the catalytic metal surface and as catalysts in their own right. The application of multimetallic catalysts has also attracted much interest because their catalytic activity and selectivity has often differed significantly from that of the homometallic systems of the Corresponding author.

Mixed-transition-metal clusters should find important application in heterogeneous catalysts since a suitable combination of different metals in the mixed metal clusters should permit more efficient interaction with substrates than obtained with mononuclear metal complexes or homometallic clusters [2]. With mixed-transition-metal clusters as precursors highly dispersed metal particles and a uniform metal composition as well as a specific structure of the two metal components manageable at the molecular level can be achieved in the oxide supported catalysts [3,4]. 188 J. Kiuiaho et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996)187-195 Synthesis gas conversion has been one of the most intriguing topics in the field of heterogeneous catalysis by transition metals. In the synthesis gas reaction the selectivity to hydrocarbons and alcohols has been limited by the Schulz-Flory distribution of the products, and tremendous efforts have been directed towards finding more selective catalysts particularly for the production of oxygenated compounds [511]. A number of reports have suggested that the size of metal particles in the catalysts might have a significant effect on the product distribution [9,11,12]. Metal clusters have been used as precursors to obtain high metal dispersion with particles smaller than 10 A [9,11]. Metalcarbonyl clusters have provided zero valent metal particles at lower reduction temperatures than have conventional precursors [13]. Also, catalysts prepared from metal carbonyl clusters are free from contamination by residual materials such as Cl- and N03. In particular, the residual Cl- is often strongly bound with the basic sites of oxide supports, thereby inhibiting the activation of CO by metals [5]. The main purpose of our work was to study, systematically, the use of tetranuclear cobalt, cobalt-ruthenium, cobalt-rhodium and rhodium carbonyl clusters as catalyst precursors. The influence of the metal composition on the activity and selectivity of silica-supported catalysts was determined in the synthesis gas reaction. To determine the benefits of the mixed metal preparations, the catalysts prepared from mixed metal clusters were also compared with catalysts prepared from homometallic clusters of the same metals and metal contents. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of catalysts Commercially available Co4(CO)12 and Rh4(CO)12 were obtained from Strem Chemicals, Inc. The other metal carbonyl clusters were prepared by published methods and were as follows: H4Ru4(CO),2 [14], CoRu3H3(CO)12 [15], Co2Ru2H2(CO)12 [16], Co2Ru2(CO)13 [17], Co 3RuH(CO)12 [2], Co2Rh2(CO)12 and Co3Rh(CO)12 [18]. Grace 432 silica support was dried under vacuum at 600/2 h to dehydroxylate the surface [13,19]. The homo- or heterometallic carbonyl cluster catalysts were prepared by impregnation from nitrogenated dichloromethane solution under deoxygenated atmosphere. The metal loading of all preparations was 0.9 mmol/1 g Si02 and the catalysts were dried slowly under vacuum at room temperature. The final metal loading was between 5 wt.-% (Co4(CO)12) and 8.5 wt.-% (Rh4(CO)12). Every step in the preparation of the catalyst was carried out under inert atmosphere using a glove box and nitrogen vacuum line. 2.2. Reaction tests Hydrogenation of carbon monoxide was carried out in a modified SOTELEM LCT-570 continuous flow fixed bed tubular reactor equipped with an on-line GC system consisting of two HP-5890 series II gas chromatographs. Because the product mixture is complex, six columns, 3 FIDs and 1 TCD were necessary for the analysis. Light hydrocarbons were separated on an A1203-KCl column, HP-1 was used for heavy hydrocarbons, TCEP together with HP-1 was chosen for oxygenates, and a combination of the Porapak-Q and a packed column with squalane on activated carbon was utilized for permanent gases and water. The response factors were determined by measurements of the standard samples. The catalyst was loaded into the reactor in a glove box under deoxygenated (< 1 ppm) and dried argon atmosphere. The amount of catalyst used in reaction tests was 1.0 g (2.75 ml). The reactor was connected to the reactor system without contact with air. Just prior to use the catalyst was reduced in situ under flowing hydrogen at 300/2 h (r = 2/min). After reduction, the catalyst was slowly cooled to 190 J.

The reaction was initiated by changing the gas flow to synthesis gas and by increasing the pressure of the reactant gas to the desired reaction pressure. The composition of the synthesis gas was CO/HZ/Ar= 3/6/1, and argon was used as an internal standard for the analysis. The product selectivities were determined as carbon efficiencies (C-%) based on the amount of CO reacted. The reaction pressure was kept constant at 2.1 MPa and the typical reaction temperature was 233. However, the temperature dependence of the conversion and the selectivities was studied by varying the temperature within 190-290. The conversion was adjusted to 3% by changing the flow rate of the synthesis gas (2-401/h) while temperature (233) and pressure (2.1 MPa) were kept constant.

The Ru4/Si02 and C04/S'02 catalysts exhibited a very high activity for CO conversion, and both formed mainly hydrocarbons, in particular the high hydrocarbons. The bimetallic catalysts exhibited lower activity than the homometallic catalysts except for Co2Ru2(II)/Si02 which exhibited equal activity with the C04/S'02 catalyst. Our results are in disagreement with those of Xiao et al. [3]. In their experiments the activity of the bimetallic catalysts increased with the increasing molar ratio of Co/Ru, and the homometallic cobalt and ruthenium carbonyl catalysts were the least active. The most important reason for these differences is the pretreatment of the catalysts. Namely, Xiao et al. [3] calcined their catalysts under 02 flow at 300 before in situ reduction, whereas we handled our catalysts in inert atmosphere. Except for the Co2Ru2(II)/Si02 catalyst, as the molar ratio of Co/Ru in the Coo-uSi02 catalysts increased, the activity first decreased, reaching a minimum when the ratio was 1:1, and then increased. The Co2Ru2(II)/Si02 catalyst exhibited equal activity with C04/S'02 and much higher activity than Co2Ru2(I)/Si02. This extraordinary behaviour may be related to the composition of the precursor. all other Coo-,,Ruprecursors had equal amounts of hydrogen and ruthenium in their molecular structure, but in Co2Ru2(II), two hydrogens were replaced by a carbonyl making the number of carbonyl groups 13 instead of 12. Dobos et al. [20] and Schay et al. [21] have studied the interaction between FeRu bimetallic carbonyl cluster and silica support. Dobos et al. [20] observed that H2FeRu3(CO)13 reacts with hydrogen to produce H4FeRu3(CO)12 and CO. Analogously Co2Ru2(II) may have reacted with hydrogen to produce Co2Ru2(I) and CO, and the CO may have reacted with the metal species already present on the surface to form metal-carbon species. Such metal-carbon species have been observed to enhance the dispersion in Fe-Ru catalysts [21 ]. Our results [22], too, indicate that the catalysts are more dispersed in the presence of CO. In the case of Coo-uSi02 and (Co4 + Ru4)/Si02 catalysts, there was a clear product orientation towards hydrocarbons. In all cases the selectivity to hydrocarbons was more than 90 C-%. The tendency to produce an abundance of CS-C13 hydrocarbons (45-65 C-%) and little methane (< 20 C-%) was also clear, except for Ru4/Si02 which much preferred C$ + hydrocarbons (> 75 C-%). The chain growth probability a was within 0.72-0.82 for all Coo-uSi02 catalysts except Ru4/Si02, for which a was 0.91. The Schulz-Flory equation, with the conclusion that the maximum mass selectivity to the CS-C I1 cut is 48% [23], holds fairly well for the Co4_uSi02 catalysts. Precursors influenced the hydrocarbon distribution even with equal Co/Ru ratio, as shown in Fig. 1. The plot of In (Wn) vs. carbon number was a similar straight line for the Co2Ru2(I)/Si02 and Co2Ru2(II)/Si02 catalysts but differed for the (Co4 + Ru4)/Si02 catalyst, which produced more C1-C4 hydrocarbons, the same amount of CS-C8 and less 4 2- 3 o _2 -4 (Ru4 + Coo) Ru4Co4(1) Ru4Co4(11) 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Carbon number Fig. 1.

Kioiaho et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996) 187-195 C9-C13 hydrocarbons relative to the other two catalysts. The Coo-nRuSi02 catalysts formed only small amounts of oxygenates. For instance, the selectivity of Coo/Si02, Co3Ru/Si02, Co2Ru2(1)/Si02, CoRu3/Si02 and Ru4/Si02 for oxygenates was only 4.2, 7.5, 4.1, 3.5 and 0.4 C-% respectively. The selectivity to oxygenates was highest when the Co/Ru ratio was 3 and lowest when the catalyst contained only ruthenium. However, the (Co4 + Ru4)/Si02 catalyst prepared from the two homometallic clusters had the highest selectivity to oxygenates (8.6 C-%). The selectivity was noticeably higher than with Co2Ru2(1)/Si02 and C02Ru2(11)/Si02, even though the Co/Ru ratio was the same. The differing selectivities for oxygenates indicate that both the nature of the precursor and the ratio of the metals influence the reactivity of the catalysts. 3.2. Co-Rh catalysts The activity of the C04_,,RhSi02 and (Co4 + Rh4)/Si02 catalysts decreased with respect to the precursor in the following order: C04 > C03Rh > Rh4 > Co2Rh2 > (Co4 + Rh4). The catalysts were least active when the Co/Rh ratio was 1:1. The catalyst prepared from the two homometallic cluster precursors (Co4 + Rh4) exhibited somewhat weaker activity than the catalyst prepared from the corresponding bimetallic cluster. The activities of the bimetallic Co4_hn/Si02 catalysts did not lie between those of the homometallic C04/S'02 and Rh4/Si02, and the C02Rh2/Si02 catalyst Table 3 The selectivities for oxygenates on Co4_ hSi0z catalyst Catalyst 191 was less active than the pure rhodium catalyst. Our findings are opposite to those of Ceriotti et al. [24], who found Co2Rh2/A1203 to be significantly more active than Rh4/A1203 catalyst. The disagreement in the results may be due to the different metal loading and support as well as to the much lower reaction pressure used in their experiments. The difference might also be related to the pretreatment of the catalysts: high temperature reduction at 500 has resulted in cobalt enrichment at the surface of bimetallic Co-Rh particles [25]. All Co4_hn/Si02 catalysts, except Coo/Si02, exhibited fairly weak activity for CO conversion and had strong tendency to produce methane as well as light hydrocarbons. The chain growth probability decreased in the order Coo > Co 3 Rh > (CO 4 + Rh4) > Co2Rh2 > Rh4, i.e. it correlated well with the number of cobalt atoms in the precursor. The selectivities for oxygenates for Coo/Si02, Co3Rh/Si02, Co2Rh2/Si02, (Co4 + Rh4)/Si02 and Rh4/Si02 were 4.2, 18.2, 21.6, 28.8 and 14.4 C-%, respectively. This result shows, in agreement with the findings of Huang et al. [26], that the catalysts prepared from the bimetallic clusters produced a greater quantity of oxygenates than did the catalysts prepared from the homometallic clusters. The result is plausible since the active sites for the formation of oxygenates are dual sites where CO is both dissociatively (site 1) and nondissociatively adsorbed (site 2) [27]. The probability of finding these dual active sites is higher in bimetallic than in homometallic catalysts. However, it should be noted that when the selectivities for MeOH EtOH PrOH BuOH > C50H AcH MeOAc EtOAc AcOH C04/Si02 0.4 1.5 1.0 0.0 0.3 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.5 C03Rh/Si02 2.8 5.0 2.5 4.1 2.3 0.5 0.4 0.1 0.5 Co2Rh2/Si02 3.2 11.1 1.3 0.4 0.0 0.8 3.5 1.3 0.0 (C04 + Rh4)/SiO2 5.8 14.8 1.8 1.5 0.3 0.7 2.6 1.0 0.3 Rh4/Si02 0.3 5.2 2.2 0.1 0.0 0.6 0.9 2.3 2.8 Reaction conditions: CO/H 2/Ar = 3:6:1, p = 2.1 MPa, T = 233 and conversion= 3%. 192 J. Kiuiaho et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996)187-195 oxygenates increased, the activity of the catalysts decreased at the same time. The product distributions of oxygenates at the constant conversion level of 3% were sensitive to the Co/Rh ratio in the catalyst (Table 3). The only product present in significant amount in all runs was ethanol, and its selectivity changed drastically with the amount of rhodium in the C04_nRhn precursor. The maximum selectivity to ethanol was obtained with the 1:1 ratio of Co/Rh; it was 11.1 C-% for C02Rh2/S'02 and 14.8 C-% for (Co4 + Rh4)/Si02. Methanol formation was higher on the bimetallic catalysts than the homometallic catalysts. The homometallic Rh4/Si02 catalyst produced a lot of oxygenates such as acetic acid and ethyl acetate, whereas the other catalysts produced them in much smaller amount or not at all. In addition, the Co2Rh2/Si02 and (Co4 + Rh4)/Si02 catalysts produced surprisingly much methyl acetate, while the amount of acetic Co3Rh/Si02 50 40 30 20 to 0 acid was small or undetectable. This may indicate that, on the bimetallic catalyst with Co/Rh ratio 1:1, acetic acid reacted with methanol to form methyl acetate. The Co2Rh2/Si02 and (Co4 + Rh4)/Si02 catalysts behave similarly but not the same; the (Co4 + Rh4)/Si02 catalyst produced a slightly greater proportion of higher alcohols than the C02Rh2/S'02 catalyst did. Perhaps the preparation of the (Co4 + Rh4)/Si02 catalyst did not ensure the formation of the alloy phase with constant overall composition. In fact, this catalyst had a higher chain growth probability than the Co2Rh2/Si02 catalyst, probably because it had some pure Coo ensembles on the surface. 3.3. Influence of reaction temperature The influence of the reaction temperature on the activities and selectivities was determined at 190 to 290oC at constant pressure (2.1 MPa) 50 45 40 35 30 b 25 '~ d 20 U 15 10 5 5 Conv.(%) Methane f HC(C2-C4) HC(C5-C8) HC(C>8) Oxygenates 40 35 30 25 U zu 15 to ~-031curu51u2 35 220 240 260 280 300 190 200 210 220 230 240 250 260 T () T () Fig. 2.

Kiviahn et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996) 187-195 and flow rate of synthesis gas (6 1/h). The activity of all our catalysts increased dramatically with increasing reaction temperature, as shown by the examples in Fig. 2. Nevertheless, the influence of temperature was fairly small for Co4_hn/Si02 catalysts until 250, but greater for the more active Co4_un/Si02 catalysts under the same conditions. Selectivities for methane and CZ-C4 hydrocarbons increased, and the selectivity to C8+ hydrocarbons decreased on all catalysts with increasing temperature. At the same time the selectivity to CS-Cg hydrocarbons decreased moderately on the Co4_hSi02 catalysts and remained almost constant on the Co4_nRUR/Si02 catalysts. Co4_uSi02 catalysts did not produce a lot of oxygenates at any conditions and the selectivity to oxygenates was low regardless of temperature. For the Co4_hSi02 catalysts, which are efficient in the formation of oxygenates, the selectivity to oxygenates depended strongly on temperature: the amount of oxygenates decreased sharply above 260. Most influenced by the reaction temperature was ethanol formation, the selectivity to ethanol on the Co3Rh/Si02 catalyst, for instance, decreased from 7.5 to 1.6 C-% when the temperature increased from 210 to 290. Benitez et al. [27] have proposed that the competition between the insertion step and the complete hydrogenation to methane controls the selectivity to ethanol. With increasing temperature, the sharp increase in the selectivity to methane and the simultaneous decrease in the selectivity to ethanol, agree well with the proposed competition between the insertion step and the complete hydrogenation. The amount of other oxygenates also decreased with increasing temperature, but the influence of temperature was much less important than for ethanol. The reaction mechanism for the other oxygenates must therefore be entirely different, or at least another parallel route that is less temperature sensitive must be operative. One possibility is the combination of alkyl species with the adsorbed surface OH group as proposed by Wojciechowski [28]. 193 Likewise Orita et al. [29] and Jackson et al. [30] have claimed that the formation of ethanol and acetaldehyde on rhodium catalysts takes place differently: the reaction of molecular CO with H \" results in an alcohol, whereas the reaction with CH 2 results in an aldehyde. 3.4. Catalyst deactivation A clean catalyst surface begins to deactivate as soon as it encounters reactant molecules. Usually, this initial state is too fast to be detected by conventional reactor systems such as ours. The steady state is achieved after the deactivation of initially very active sites that play no further role in the catalysis [11]. In our experiments the steady state was achieved after five hours of reaction time and thereafter the conversion was measured periodically during the following 75 h. All catalysts were deactivated as indicated by the decay of the relative activity (Fig. 3). The relative activity is determined as C,/C; where Ci is the initial conversion at 5 h reaction time and C, is the conversion at time t. The order of relative activity of Co4_hSi0z catalysts after 75 h reaction time was the following: Coo = Rh4 > (Co4 + Rh4) > Co2Rh2 > Co3Rh. The results show that the homometallic catalysts were the most resistant to deactivation. The bimetallic catalysts deactivated rapidly and after 75 h their relative activity was very low. For instance, the activity of the Co3Rh/Si02 catalyst was only 0.43. These results indicate that the nature of the precursor affected the deactivation process considerably, because all other parameters were kept constant. The deactivation was probably caused by coking, i.e. layers of coke deposit decreased the accessible surface area and the active metals became encapsulated by carbon. The combined site of cobalt and rhodium appeared to play an important role in the deactivation of bimetallic Co4_hSi02 catalysts, although the exact mechanism remains unknown. 194 J.

The order of relative activity of C04-,Run/S'02 catalysts after 75 h reaction time was the following: C04 > (Co4 + Ru4) Co3Ru -- CoRu3 > C02Ru2(I) > Ru4. In every case, the initial deactivation was rapid, but the further deactivation, within 25 and 50 h of reaction was moderate. The activity of the homometallic Ru4/Si02 catalyst declined most dramatically and after 25 h of reaction time was only about 40% of the initial activity. Probably the high hydrocarbons, such as waxes, plugged the small pores and blocked the active metal surfaces inside the pores. In fact, the probability of chain growth was exceptionally high for Ru4/Si02. However, Krishna and Bell [31] have estimated that only 3-7% of the exposed Ru sites on Ru/Ti02 could have been covered by wax after the reaction. They concluded that the immediate initial deactivation was mainly due to the accumulation of carbidic carbon species. The homometallic C04/S'02 and Ru4/Si02 catalysts were the most and the least resistant to deactivation, respectively. All bimetallic cobalt-ruthenium catalysts fell in between the homometallic catalysts in terms of deactivation. This clearly demonstrates that the deactivation of the C04_nRuSi02 catalysts is closely related to the presence of ruthenium. 4. Conclusions We studied systematically the tetranuclear cobalt, cobalt-ruthenium, cobalt-rhodium and rhodium carbonyl clusters as catalyst precursors in the synthesis gas reaction. Activities were highest for the catalysts derived from homometallic clusters, and lowest for catalysts with 1:1 ratio of Co/Ru or Co/Rh. The unexpectedly low activities might have been due to the relatively low reduction temperature (300) used for our catalysts, which could have caused incomplete alloying. J. Kiuiaho et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996) 187-195 Interestingly enough, the highly active homometallic cobalt catalyst was also the most resistant to deactivation. After 75 h reaction time, the homometallic cobalt and rhodium catalysts were the most active ones, whereas the ruthenium catalyst had lost most of its activity. The deactivation was stronger on bimetallic sites. On the Co4_,,RuSi02 catalysts the deactivation was closely related to the presence of ruthenium, which is known to strongly promote the formation of high molecular weight hydrocarbons. The selectivities for oxygenated compounds were clearly promoted by the bimetallic sites of Co-Rh catalysts. This result is very plausible since the probability to find dual active sites responsible for the formation of oxygenates is greater in bimetallic than in homometallic catalysts. Our results also provide evidence for a reaction mechanism with two separate pathways for oxygenate formation: one for ethanol and the other for aldehydes.
