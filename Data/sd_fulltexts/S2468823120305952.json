Graphical abstract In this paper, we report a new type of sulfur resistant hydrogenation catalyst, which was obtained by simply phosphating commercial Pd/C catalyst with triphenylphosphine under H2 atmosphere at 600 °C. At this temperature, no palladium phosphides formed in XRD patterns due to the low synthetic temperature. Element analysis, N2 adsorption-desorption and ICP characterizations show that only a small amount of P has been introduced into Pd, so the phosphorus doping does not change the pore size and surface area of pristine Pd/C. XPS characterization shows that P doping can effectively prevent the substrate adsorption on Pd surface, which relieves the sulfurization rate of Pd. Hence, the phosphorus doping catalyst can fully catalyze the 4-nitrothioanisole to 4-aminothioanisole and exhibits higher activity than Pd/C, which only has 70.9 % conversion. Moreover, the phosphorus doped Pd/C catalyst has better stability than Pd/C and its activity is almost unchanged during the recycle. Keywords Triphenylphosphine Phosphorus 4-nitrothioanisole Sulfurization 1 Introduction Aromatic amino compounds, especially [1] sulfur-containing aniline is of great importance for the synthesis of various drugs, such as antibiotics, insecticides, fungicides, etc. [2]. Conventionally, aromatic amino compound is prepared by reducing nitro compounds using the reductant reagents like Fe [3,4], Zn [5,6] or Na2S2 [7] and so on in high concentration liquid acid. However, these reagents bring about seriously environmental pollution. In recent years, the catalytic hydrogenation of nitro compounds with H2 on the supported noble metal (i.e. Pd [8], Pt [9]) catalysts is widely used because of their high catalytic activity, excellent reusability, and environment-friendly process. However, it is still challenging to produce sulfur-containing aniline via hydrogenation over noble metal catalysts, which suffers from the sulfur poison by the formation of strong metal-sulfur bond. A series of methods have been tried to enhance the sulfur resistance of metal catalysts. At present, one of the most widely used methods in the industry is the presulfiding of supported metal catalysts with H2S, Na2S or organic sulfur-containing molecules to form a metal sulfide [10–15]. The stable chemical properties of metal sulfides made them keep a relatively long-term hydrogenation performance under sulfur-containing systems [16]. However, such a method faces the problems of serious environmental pollution and high industrialization cost. Especially, after presulfiding of metal catalysts, the catalytic hydrogenation performance of active species decreases significantly. Subsequently, organic ligands such as organophosphines and organic nitrogens have been used to prepare metal complexes for improving the sulfur resistance of metal catalysts. Okamoto et al. [17] have prepared tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium instead of metallic palladium for the hydrogenating of the sulfur-containing substrates. The benzene ring of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium prevents the contact of Pd with the sulfur-containing substrate and avoids the deactivation of the catalyst in the sulfur-containing reaction system. Urban et al. [18] have prepared a ruthenium-N-heterocyclic carbene catalyst which is capable of hydrogenating substituted thiophene and benzothiophene to form the corresponding tetrahydrothiophene derivatives at room temperature. Malanga [19] have prepared a catalyst which can be widely used for the reduction of azide compounds to primary amines by pressing tributyltin hydride (Bu3SnH) with 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane nickel chloride. The catalyst can realize the hydrogenation of azides under mild conditions and has a good hydrogenation performance for the thiophene-containing azide compound with a target yield of 95 %. However, such catalysts are mainly used in homogeneous reaction systems, which leads to a high cost in the separation and purification of products. Therefore, the development of heterogeneous catalyst with excellent sulfur resistance has attracted much attention. Recently, metal phosphides with high hydrogenation activity and sulfur resistance have been regarded as potential hydrotreating catalysts. A series of phosphides, such as nickel phosphides, cobalt phosphides, iron phosphides, were prepared by temperature-programmed reduction methods using (NH4)2HPO4 or other inorganic phosphorus as the phosphorus source [20–23]. Above transition metal phosphide catalysts exhibited better hydrodesulfurization activity and higher reaction stability than transition metal catalysts. In addition to the above transition metal phosphides, noble metal phosphides (such as PdxP [24], RhxP [25], RuxP [26]) were also synthesized subsequently. These noble metal phosphides exhibited a good performance in hydrodesulfurization and other hydrogenation reactions. However, the hydrogenation ability of phosphorus doping noble metal catalysts for the sulfur-containing substrates has not been reported. Here, we report a new type of sulfur resistant hydrogenation catalyst of phosphorus-doped noble metal, which was obtained by simply phosphating commercial Pd/C catalyst with triphenylphosphine under H2 atmosphere at 600 °C. The as-prepared phosphorus doped Pd catalyst showed better hydrogenation activity and sulfur-resistance than Pd/C in the hydrogenation of 4-nitrothioanisole. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Triphenylphosphine (TPP) was obtained from Tianjin Bailingwei Co. Ltd. Hexane and toluene were purchased from Tianjin Suihua Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. 4-nitrothioanisole was purchased from Tianjin Xien Si Opod Technology Co. Ltd. All the above chemical reagents are analytical reagents and used without further purification. The commercial 5.0 wt.% Pd/C catalyst (wetted with 53 % water) was gotten from Shanxi Rock New Materials Co. Ltd 2.2 Catalyst preparation 0.062 g (0.236 mmol) of TPP was dissolved in 10 mL of n-hexane in a three-necked flask with stirring under the N2 atmosphere. After the TPP was completely dissolved, 0.25 g (0.118 mmol Pd) 5 wt.% Pd/C was added and the solution was stirred for 1 h, then the temperature was raised to 110 °C and maintained at this temperature for 5 h to remove the solvent. After the solvent was evaporated, the obtained sample was placed in a tube furnace and heated to 600 °C in a hydrogen atmosphere with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 at a temperature ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 and held for 2 h. The catalyst P-Pd/C-2 was obtained after cooling to room temperature. The different P doping Pd/C catalysts (denoted as P-Pd/C-n, where n is the molar ratio of TPP to Pd in precursor) were prepared. 2.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku SmartLab 9KW instrument to characterize the crystallographic information of the samples. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed with a FEI Talos F200x G2 instrument operated at 200 kV for measuring Pd nanoparticle size and elemental composition of the catalyst. N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were carried out at 77.3 K using a BELSORP-mini autosorption analyzer. The specific surface areas were calculated according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation while pore distributions were obtained by the Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. Samples were degassed in flowing N2 at 473 K for 3 h before the measurements. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the catalysts were measured using an Axis Ultra DLD from Kratos Analytical Ltd. Binding energy of measured spectra was corrected using C1s peak at 284.6 eV. The metal content of catalysts was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) using a SpectroBlue spectrometer. 2.4 Hydrogenation of 4-nitrothioanisole Pd-based catalyst (0.01 g), 4-nitrothioanisole (0.5 g) and toluene (7.5 mL) were added into the autoclave. Before the reaction started, the autoclave was flushed three times with hydrogen to ensure the exclusion of air. When the reaction temperature rises to the desired temperature of 170 °C, the hydrogen pressure was adjusted to 3 MPa and then the stirring was started with a speed of 1000 rpm to exclude the effect of external diffusion. After one hour reaction time, the reaction temperature dropped to room temperature and the liquid products were analyzed by gas chromatography using an FID detector. 2.5 Reuse of the catalysts The catalyst after the reaction was recovered by filtration and rinsed three times with toluene. The washed catalyst was then dried in an oven at 70 ℃ for 10 h to remove toluene. Considering the mass loss of the catalyst after filtration, the amounts of raw materials were decreased according to the amount of catalyst to maintain the same molar ratio. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization XRD patterns of the catalysts P-Pd/C-n and the pristine Pd/C are showed in the Fig. 1 . The pristine Pd/C presents four peaks at 2θ = 40.4°, 46.7°, 68.1° and 82.1°, respectively, corresponding to (111) (200) (220) and (311) facets of metallic Pd with a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure. It can be seen from the local enlarged view of XRD that the diffraction peaks of P-Pd/C-n shifted slightly to the left with the addition of phosphorus. This slight shift can be attributed to the insertion of P atoms into the Pd lattice [27]. At the same time, it can be seen from the figure that the half-peak widths of P-Pd/C-n are smaller than that of Pd/C. It indicates that the size of Pd nanoparticles in P-Pd/C-n is larger than that of Pd/C, and the reason for the increase in size may be that the high temperature in the phosphating process causes the aggregation of Pd nanoparticles. Fig. 2 a shows the High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM) micrographs of P-Pd/C-2. The lattice fringe of the nanoparticles was measured as 0.240 nm, which is larger than that of the face-centered cubic Pd (111) plane (0.224 nm) [28]. And the Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis of above single nanoparticle (Fig. 2b) further determines the co-existence of elemental Pd and P in one particle. The above results indicate that the phosphorus is successfully doped into Pd/C. Table 1 lists the amounts of Pd and P of the Pd/C and P-Pd/C-n catalysts measured by ICP-OES. There is a small amount of P element (0.08 wt.%) in the fresh Pd/C, which should be attributed to the residual P during the preparation of active carbon. Besides, in the catalyst P-Pd/C-n, the actual P content in the catalysts are much lower than that of P addition. At the same time, as the molar ratio of P to Pd of the precursor increases from 1:1 to 4:1, the amount of P in the prepared P-Pd/C-n changes slightly. Most of the P is released during the heat treatment in the preparation of catalyst. So, the low P loading of the catalyst may be the reason why no peaks of palladium phosphide can be found in XRD patterns [29]. Fig. 3 shows the TEM image and particle size distribution of Pd/C and P-Pd/C-2 catalysts. The results show that the average particle diameters of Pd in Pd/C and P-Pd/C-n are 2.4 nm and 4.3 nm, respectively. It is consistent with the conclusion of XRD results that the particle of P-Pd/C-2 is bigger than that of Pd/C. In addition, the average size of Pd nanoparticles in Pd/C after treatment at 600 °C(Pd/C-600) is 4.1 nm (Fig. S1a), which is close to that in P-Pd/C-2 catalyst (4.3 nm), indicating that P doping has less influence on the Pd particle size. The TEM image and EDS elemental mappings of P-Pd/C-2 presented in Fig. 3c shows that Pd nanoparticle and P element are uniformly distributed in the P-Pd/C-2. The richer P element in the P-Pd/C-2 is consistent with the ICP result in the Table 1. In order to further investigate the effect of P doping on the physical properties of the catalyst, the N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were carried out. The structural properties of the Pd/C and P-Pd/C-n are summarized in the Table 2 , which show that the P-Pd/C-n have the similar specific surface area and tunnel structure with Pd/C. According to ICP data, the reason that the internal structure of the catalyst did not change significantly may be due to the loss of most P during the preparation process, and only a small amount of P reacted with Pd on the Pd/C surface. Fig. 4 shows the N2-adsorption desorption curves of P-Pd/C-2 and Pd/C. The isothermal adsorption curves in the Fig. 4a are type IV isothermal adsorption. The curve and the hysteresis loop are H4 hysteresis loops. They show that the overall pore structure of P-Pd/C-2 and Pd/C is irregular and mainly consists of a micro-mesoporous structure. Fig. 4b shows that the P-Pd/C-2 and Pd/C have a similar pore size distribution. In general, the addition of P has no obvious effect on the overall pore structure of the catalyst. The Fig. 5 a shows the detailed spectra of Pd for catalysts Pd/C and P-Pd/C-2, respectively. It is found that the two peaks at 336.0 eV and 341.3 eV in fresh Pd/C are corresponding to the Pd° 3d5/2 and Pd° 3d3/2, respectively [30]. However, the two peaks in the Pd regions of P-Pd/C-2 at 336.3 eV and 341.6 eV are slightly higher than the binding energy for fresh Pd/C and below the value for Pd2+(337.2 eV and 342.5 eV) [30], which indicate that Pd in P-Pd/C-2 bears a partial positive charge (Pdδ +). This may be due to the fact that the interacting role of Pd with P makes positively charged Pd donate electrons and thus leads to a decrease of the 3d electron density of the Pd atom in P-Pd/C-2 [31,32]. Besides, the peak in the P region of P-Pd/C-2 at 133.5 eV can be correspond to phosphate species formed when being exposed in air after reduction [33]. The peak for P species in metal phosphides, observed around 130.0 eV for MoP/SiO2 [34], Ni2P/SiO2 [35], and Pd3P/SiO2 catalysts [36], is not apparent in the P 2p3/2 region for the P-Pd/C-2 catalyst. That may be due to the lower P loading for the P-Pd/C-2 catalyst (1.2 wt.% P) than for those metal phosphides (5−10 wt.% P) [36]. At the same time, there is no P signal in the XPS analysis of Pd/C. The above results indicate that Pd and P were successfully bonded together by a post-treatment method at 600 °C with hydrogen when triphenylphosphine was used as the phosphorus source. Most of the P element was lost during the preparation of the catalyst, only a small amount of P reacted with Pd. Therefore, compared with fresh Pd/C, the physical structure of P-Pd/C-2 is almost unchanged, and there are similar diffraction peaks on XRD results. 3.2 Catalytic activity of the catalyst The XRD patterns of catalysts prepared at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 6 a. It can be seen from the figure that below 700 °C, palladium element exists in the form of metallic palladium. However, when the hydrogen treatment temperature is higher than 700 °C, three diffraction peaks at 2θ = 33.4°, 39.9° and 43.1° appeared, which can be attributed to the Pd12P3.2. The XPS spectra of P for the catalyst obtained at 700 °C (Pd12P3.2/C-700) shows the characteristic peak at the binding energy of 130.4 eV (Fig. S2) assigned to palladium phosphide. These results show the treatment temperature should not be lower than 700 °C for preparing palladium phosphide. So, temperature is the main factor on the formation of palladium phosphide. However, it can be seen from Fig. 6b that when the preparation temperature of the catalyst is 600 °C, the catalyst with an active phase of P-doped Pd has better hydrogenation activity than the catalyst with an activity phase of Pd12P3.2 for the hydrogenation of 4-nitrothioanisole. The effect of the amount of P added in the preparation process on the hydrogenation activity of the catalyst is shown in Fig. 7 a. It is shown that with the increase of P content in the precursor, the hydrogenation performance of the catalyst for 4-nitrothioanisole ascended first and then descended. When the molar ratio of added P to Pd is 2:1 in the preparation process, the catalyst P-Pd/C-2 had the best catalytic performance in the hydrogenation of 4-nitrothioanisole. These results indicate that the appropriate amount of P can effectively improve the hydrogenation activity of the Pd/C catalyst in sulfur-containing systems. The decrease of hydrogenation activity of the catalyst with the excess addition of P atoms can be due to the reason that the excess P atoms can poison the catalyst by blocking the unsaturated sites [37]. In order to further investigate the hydrogenation activity and sulfur resistance of the catalyst in sulfur-containing systems, the reaction system was sampled and analyzed every half an hour. The conversions of 4-nitrothioanisole on Pd/C and P-Pd/C-2 over time are shown in Fig. 7b. It can be seen from the figure that the P-Pd/C-2 can completely catalyze 4-nitrothioanisole to 4-aminothioanisole within three hours and exhibits higher activity than Pd/C, which only exhibits the conversion of 70.9 % under the same conditions. However, it also can be seen that the conversion of 4-nitrothioanisole on Pd/C at the first hour is higher than that of P-Pd/C-2. With the prolonging of reaction time, the conversion of 4-nitrothioanisole catalyzed by Pd/C increased slightly. At the same time, the conversion of 4-nitrothioanisole over P-Pd/C-2 showed a steadily increasing trend with the prolonging of the reaction time. It suggests that the P doping will reduce the initial hydrogenation activity of Pd/C, but the P-doped catalyst has better stability than Pd/C in the sulfur-containing systems. Fig. 8 shows the reusability of P-Pd/C-2. It shows that the P-Pd/C-2 can still achieve 100 % conversion of 4-nitrothioanisole after repeatedly used twice. Although the activity of P-Pd/C-2 decreased with the increase of using times, its activity in the hydrogenation of 4-nitrothioanisole was still higher than Pd/C. In order to investigate the effect of phosphorus doping on the hydrogenation performance of the catalyst in the hydrogenation of 4-nitrothioanisole, we treated activated carbon with TPP by the same process as P-Pd/C-n, and then Pd was loaded on this support by impregnation method (the detailed experimental can be found in the Supporting Information). The as-synthesized catalyst is denoted as Pd/P-C-2. The XPS spectra of Pd/P-C-2(Fig. 5) shows that the two peaks at 336.0 eV and 341.3 eV in the Pd/P-C-2 are corresponding to the Pd0 3d5/2 and Pd0 3d3/2 respectively, which are similar to these of fresh Pd/C. This result indicates that the phosphorus in the activated carbon has no effect on the electronic structure of palladium. The hydrogenation of 4-nitroanisole and 4-nitrothioanisole on Pd/C-600 and Pd/P-C-2 are shown in Figs. S3 and 7 b, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. S3 that P doping reduced the hydrogenation activity of Pd/C in the sulfur-free system, while the hydrogenation activity of recycled Pd/C decreased significantly. Besides, the kinetics of P-doped and P-free Pd/C catalysts was studied and the reaction rate constant (k) was calculated from the linear fit to the relationship between reaction time (t) and ln(Ct/C0). Where C0 is the initial concentration of 4-nitrothioanisole and Ct is the concentration of 4-nitrothioanisole after t minutes of reaction. The fitting results are shown in Fig. S4 in the revised manuscript. The hydrogenation of 4-nitrothioanisole catalyzed by Pd/C, P-Pd/C-2 and recycled Pd/C was regarded as a first-order reaction within 0.5 h. And the apparent rate constant k of Pd/C is 0.76 min−1, which is higher than these of P-Pd/C-2 (k = 0.40 min−1) and recycled Pd/C (k = 0.22 min−1) catalysts. The above results show that the hydrogenation rate of the P-doped Pd/C catalyst is lower than that of fresh Pd/C and higher than that of palladium sulfide at the initial reaction period. Fig. 7b shows that Pd/C-600, Pd/P-C-2 and Pd/C have the same tendency to catalyze 4-nitrothioanisole. As the reaction time increases, the conversions of 4-nitrothioanisole on Pd/P-C-2 and Pd/C-600 are lower than that on P-Pd/C-2. While, compared with the fresh Pd/C, the Pd/C-600 has higher hydrogenation activity, which may be attributed to the fact that high temperature can lead to a decrease in the content of activated carbon for Pd/C-600, resulting in increasing the actual loading of Pd. Therefore, fresh Pd/C and Pd/C-600 have the same active phase composition, and catalytic activity of Pd/C-600 shows the same tendency as that of Pd/C in the hydrogenation of 4-nitrothioanisole. After 3 h reaction time, Pd/C-600 also exhibited lower activity than P doped Pd/C. At the same time, it can be seen from Fig. S1a that Pd/C-600 and P-Pd/C-2 have similar particle sizes, so the effect of Pd particle size on the catalyst hydrogenation activity is also excluded. The hydrogenation trend of 4-nitrothioanisole on Pd/P-C-2 catalyst is similar to that of Pd/C, which also excludes the influence of P in activated carbon on the hydrogenation performance of the catalyst. In summary, the main factor affecting the hydrogenation performance of P-Pd/C-2 in 4-nitroanisole is P doped into Pd nanoparticles. The XRD results of recycled Pd/C and P-Pd/C-2 are shown in Fig. S5. It can be seen from the figure that the recycled Pd/C presents five peaks at 2θ = 35.2°, 36.6°, 39.5°, 40.8° and 42.8°, which can be attributed to the Pd4S. While the bulk phase of recycled P-Pd/C-2 is still metallic Pd, suggesting that P-Pd/C-2 is more resistant to sulfidation than Pd/C in the hydrogenation of 4-nitrothioanisole. Subsequently, the XPS analysis of Pd/C, P-Pd/C-2 and Pd12P3.2/C-700 after the reaction are shown in the Fig. 9 . Compared with the fresh Pd/C, the ratio of Pd° to total Pd in the used Pd/C decreased sharply. It can be attributed to that as the reaction proceeds, the Pd species in Pd/C are partially converted to PdxS. At the same time, it can be seen from Fig. 9a that the ratio of Pd° to Pd in used P-Pd/C-2 and Pd12P3.2/C-700 did not changed significantly. The ratio of Pd° to total Pd in the used Pd/C was lower than these in the used P-Pd/C-2 and Pd12P3.2/C-700. Fig. 9b shows the detailed binding energy peaks of S2p in Pd/C, P-Pd/C-2 and Pd12P3.2/C-700 after the reaction. The binding energy at 162.3 eV, 163.6 eV and 164.8 eV can be corresponded to S2− species of palladium sulfide, 4-nitrothioanisole and elementary sulfur, respectively [38]. It also can be seen from the Fig. 9b that the main form of S on the surface of recycled Pd/C, P-Pd/C-2 and Pd12P3.2/C-700 is substrate or product. These results indicated that the substrates and products will be adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst and the phosphorus doping palladium and palladium phosphide can inhibit sulfurization of the bulk Pd to form Pd sulfides. Table 3 shows detailed XPS data of Pd/C, P-Pd/C-2 and Pd12P3.2/C-700 in different states. Although the catalyst after reaction was washed by toluene and drying in the oven, the surface of recycled catalysts still contained a large amount of S element. The S element presents on the surface of recycled catalysts can be attributed to the substrate or product adsorbed on catalyst surface and the formation of PdxS. The atom ratio of S to Pd of recycled P-Pd/C-2 is 1.34, which is lower than that of Pd/C (4.53) and Pd12P3.2/C-700 (2.55). Besides, the molar ratio of S2− to Pd in recycled P-Pd/C-2 is 0.47, which is also lower than that in recycled Pd/C (0.96) and Pd12P3.2/C-700 (0.59). At the same time, it can be seen from the table that the ratio of Pd° to Pd decreas directly from 0.70 in fresh Pd/C to 0.43 after reaction, while for P-Pd/C-2 and Pd12P3.2/C-700, the ratio of P° to Pd does not change much during the reaction. These results show that the introduction of P into Pd can effectively prevent the adsorbing of sulfur-containing substrate or products on surface of the catalyst and can prevent the formation of PdxS. So, P-Pd/C-2 exhibits excellent hydrogenation activity and stability in the hydrogenation of 4-nitrothioanisole. 4 Conclusion A sulfur resistant hydrogenation catalyst has been successfully prepared by phosphating Pd/C catalysts using the triphenylphosphine as the phosphorus sources under the hydrogen atmosphere at 600 °C. Combined with XPS and ICP results, only few amounts of P have been introduced into the Pd and no palladium phosphides formed. Therefore, this catalyst keeps the similar pore structure, specific surface area with Pd/C. In the hydrogenation of 4-nitrothioanisole, P doping can prevent the adsorption of sulfur-containing substances on the catalyst surface and the formation of Pd sulfide. P-Pd/C-2 catalyst shows higher hydrogenation activity and sulfur resistance than that of Pd/C. The fresh P-Pd/C-2 can completely catalyze the 4-nitrothioanisole to 4-aminothioanisole within 3 h while the conversion of 4-nitrothioanisole on Pd/C only reaches 70.9 %. In addition, the P-Pd/C-2 catalyst after being reused twice still has higher hydrogenation activity than that of Pd/C in the hydrogenation of 4-nitrothioanisole.

        "dc:description": "In this paper, we report a new type of sulfur resistant hydrogenation catalyst, which was obtained by simply phosphating commercial Pd/C catalyst with triphenylphosphine under H2 atmosphere at 600 °C. At this temperature, no palladium phosphides formed in XRD patterns due to the low synthetic temperature. Element analysis, N2 adsorption-desorption and ICP characterizations show that only a small amount of P has been introduced into Pd, so the phosphorus doping does not change the pore size and surface area of pristine Pd/C. XPS characterization shows that P doping can effectively prevent the substrate adsorption on Pd surface, which relieves the sulfurization rate of Pd. Hence, the phosphorus doping catalyst can fully catalyze the 4-nitrothioanisole to 4-aminothioanisole and exhibits higher activity than Pd/C, which only has 70.9 % conversion. Moreover, the phosphorus doped Pd/C catalyst has better stability than Pd/C and its activity is almost unchanged during the recycle.",
