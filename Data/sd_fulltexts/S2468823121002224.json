Rhodium (III) chloride was used as an active component precursor. The supports and catalysts were investigated by a wide range of physicochemical methods: XRD, SEM and HR TEM, XPS and UV–vis DRS. In both cases, large rhodium particles with a coherent scattering region size of 15–19 nm are formed, and small ones with dimensions less than 1 nm. On the whole, smaller rhodium particles are formed on the bayerite oxide. The catalyst with pseudoboehmite-type support shows better results in the reaction. Graphical Abstract Image, graphical abstract Keywords Rhodium Alumina Supported catalysts Catalyst characterization Partial oxidation of hydrocarbons 1 Introduction Environmental safety and the efficient use of natural resources become increasingly acute issues. One of the processes that can help to solve these problems is the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, which provides reaction products that can find further application: synthesis gas for production of various substances and hydrogen for feeding fuel cells. The advantages of noble metals in this reaction, having high activity and resistance to sintering, coking, and poisoning by compounds contained in fossil fuels, are undeniable. In particular, Rh-containing catalysts were found to be more selective and active in the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, both gaseous and liquid [1,2]. At that, it is important to take into account the influence of the precursor of the active component on the properties of the catalyst [3]. The most commonly used support for such catalysts is alumina [4,5], which possesses all the properties necessary for the optimal support [6] and provides good dispersion of the metal and high resistance to sintering and poisoning with sulfur [4]. In addition, it was shown [5] that, among other supports, alumina provides the highest productivity and stability of the rhodium catalyst. Typically, catalysts containing noble metals, including the catalysts for the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, are supported on γ-Al2O3 [4,5,7]. However, it has been shown [7] that the use of γ-Al2O3 leads to a low resistance to sintering of Rh particles. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published examples on the use of bayerite alumina (η- and θ-Al2O3) as a support for powder Rh catalysts for the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons. It is surprising, because this reaction is carried out at sufficiently high temperatures (about 900 °C), and, to provide thermal stability of a catalyst, it would be reasonable to use, as a support, θ-Al2O3 obtained at a temperature greater than 800 °С. The surface chemistry of θ-Al2O3 is similar to the surface chemistry of conventional γ-Al2O3 [8,9], which is the basis for its use as a support. At the same time, the structural characteristics of θ-Al2O3 are different from those of γ-Al2O3, and this affects the properties of both alumina and a catalyst obtained on its basis. The oxide θ-Al2O3 has a monoclinic structure, which can be considered as a distorted spinel [10]. Besides, its structure can be regarded as intermediate between the cubic close packing of oxygen atoms, which is characteristic of low-temperature forms of alumina, and the hexagonal close packing, which describes the phase of α-Al2O3 [11]. In this work, rhodium (III) chloride was used as a precursor of rhodium. To reveal the influence of the high-temperature bayerite type support on the structure and properties of obtained catalysts, various forms of alumina were used. The supports were two types of alumina formed at a temperature close to the reaction temperature (800 °C). One of them was obtained by calcining bayerite, which was prepared from a supersaturated aluminate solution. In this case, it was possible to form a firmly fixed layer of this support on the surface of a heat-conducting substrate – FeCrAl mesh. Such assembly made it possible to control such reaction conditions as heat and mass transfer and to equalize the temperature field along the catalyst length. This, in turn, reduced local overheating in the frontal layer of the catalyst. For comparison, a catalyst supported on another form of alumina (γ-Al2O3) was synthesized. This support was calcined at the same temperature as the bayerite oxide – 800 °C. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of the support Aluminum hydroxide (bayerite) obtained by crystallization from supersaturated aluminate solutions was used to synthesize the high-temperature support 1-θ. The solution temperature was kept at 25 °C by using a thermostat. To achieve supersaturation of the sodium aluminate solution, aluminum (A5 – 99.5% pure) was dissolved in NaOH solution (0.1 M). After precipitation, the precipitate was washed with hot distilled water to neutral pH. After that, the precipitate was dried at room temperature for 24 h, then kept at 120 °C for 1 h, and then calcined at 800 °C for 1 h. The obtained alumina was washed with nitric acid (30%), then thoroughly washed with water, dried, and calcined at 600 °C. After that, concentrated alkali was added and warmed; the filtrate was separated, washed with water, and then dried at 120 °C. The resulting alumina powder was placed in very dilute nitric acid, stirred for some time, and then neutralized to pH~ 6. After that, it was filtered, washed repeatedly with water, and then calcined in air at 800 °C for 3 h. The high-temperature support 2-γ (γ-Al2O3) was obtained by calcining γ-Al2O3 (Sasol, Ssp = 198 m2/g) in air at 800 °C for 1 h. 2.2 Synthesis of RH-containing catalysts Catalysts K1-θ-Cl and K2-γ-Cl were synthesized using the supports 1-θ and 2-γ, respectively. The catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of the supports with an aqueous solution of rhodium (III) chloride. The samples were dried at 110–120 °C, calcined at 800 °C for 1 h, and then reduced in 5 vol.% H2 in an N2 flow at 600 °C for 1 h. Both the catalysts contained 2% wt Rh. 2.3 Physicochemical methods 1 X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Diffraction patterns of the samples were obtained with the use of copper radiation СuKαav (λ = 0.15418 nm). The survey was carried out using a Thermo ARL X'tra device with the focusing geometry θ-θ in the scanning mode in a range 2θ = 5÷75° with a step of 0.05°. Sizes of coherent scattering regions (CSR) were obtained from the widths of diffraction peaks at half-maximum using the Scherrer equation [12]. 2 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Spectra of the samples were taken using a SPECS X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Germany) with non-monochromatized MgKα radiation (hν = 1253.6 eV). The regions Al2p, Al2s, C1s, O1s, and Rh3d were recorded and analyzed. To take into account the effect of recharging the surface of the samples under the action of X-ray radiation, the spectra were calibrated using the position of the Al2s line (Ebind = 119.3 eV). 3 Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy (UV–Vis DRS). UV–Vis DR spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2501 PC spectrophotometer with an ISR-240 A diffuse reflectance attachment. Powder samples were placed in a quartz cuvette with an optical path length of 2 mm. The spectra were recorded relative to the reflection standard, BaSO4, in a range of 190–900 nm (11000–53000 cm–1). The resulting reflection coefficients were converted into absorption coefficients, using the Kubelka-Munk function F (R) = (1-R)2 / 2R, where R is the diffuse reflection coefficient, depending on the wavenumber expressed in cm−1. The final UV–vis DR data are presented in the following coordinates: Kubelka – Munk function, F (R) – wave number. Using the UV–vis DR spectra, the width of the Rh2O3 band gap was calculated from the fundamental absorption edge (FAE) of the material. The graphical dependence α2 = f (hν) was constructed, where α is the absorption coefficient equal to α = ((1-R)2 / 2R) • Ehν, R is the diffuse reflection coefficient, Ehν is the radiation energy, and hν is the photon energy in eV. Index 2 in the equation was used because this oxide is a direct-gap semiconductor. A region was selected on the graph where the experimental points satisfied a linear relationship. Next, the linear dependence was extrapolated to the abscissa axis, where the intersection point with the axis matched the width of the Rh2O3 gap. 4 Electron microscopy techniques. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data were obtained using a JEM 2200FS transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd.), at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and with a 0.1 nm lattice resolution. The dark-field images were obtained in the scanning mode using a HAADF (High-Angle Abstract Dark-Field) detector. Samples were applied onto 3-mm diameter copper grids coated with a carbon film with a network of holes. Alcohol suspensions of samples were dispersed with 35-kHz ultrasound and applied to the grids. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study was performed using a JSM 6460 LV (\"JEOL\") raster electron microscope with a 3-nm resolution, giving a 300-fold magnification, and equipped with an INCA Energy-350 energy dispersive spectrometer (Oxford Instrument). 5 The elemental composition was determined by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. The secondary spectrum was recorded using an ARL Perform'X X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). Spectrum processing and calculation of the content of elements were carried out using the built-in software package UniQuant. 2.4 Catalytic studies The catalytic experiments were carried out in a flow reactor (Fig. S1) consisting of a quartz tube with an inner diameter of 5 mm and with a heating element and thermal insulation located on the outside. The reactor wall temperature was controlled with thermocouple 1, while the temperature of the catalyst was monitored with thermocouple 2 located in the center of the catalyst bed. The compositions of the reaction mixture and reaction products were analyzed with a GH-1000 gas chromatograph (Khromos, Russia) equipped with two thermal conductivity detectors (TCD) and a flame ionization detector. One column, which was packed with carbon sieves, and a TCD with He as a carrier gas were used to separate and to determine the concentrations of CO, CH4, and CO2. The second column with molecular sieves and the second TCD were used to separate H2, O2, and N2 and to determine their concentrations. In this case, the carrier gas was Ar. The third, capillary, column (50 m long) was used to separate and detect organic compounds with the flame ionization detector. The weight of a catalyst was 0.200–0.203 g, and the length of a catalyst bed was about 10 mm. Before testing, the catalyst was reduced in a flow of a mixture N2 + Н2 (10 vol.%) at 400 °C for 1 h. After the reduction, the temperature was increased to 550 °C and a reaction mixture was fed into the reactor. Natural gas with a composition of 92.9% CH4, 4.7% C2H6, and 2.4% C3H8 was used as a source of methane, and the reaction mixture had the following composition: CH4, O2, N2, C2H6, C3H8 = 25.80, 15.65, 58.00, 1.31, 0.67 vol.%. The tests were carried out at the following temperatures: 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, and 800 °C. For comparison, thermodynamic calculations for this reaction mixture and in this temperature range are presented below. The thermodynamic calculations were carried out using the HSC 7.0 Chemistry software. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Support – alumina Support 1-θ. The synthesized alumina had a pink tint and, according to elemental chemical analysis, contained 0.12 wt% Fe, 0.09 wt% Si, and 52.69 wt% Al. After the acid-base treatment, the Fe content decreased to 0.10%. Thus, the resulting alumina sample contains a small amount of iron-containing phases, which decreases after the treatment with acid and alkali. However, as shown in [13-15], the use of such Fe-containing catalysts in the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons is possible. The bayerite-type support was studied by diffraction methods, UV–vis DRS and electron microscopy methods. Some results (UV–vis DRS, SEM data and texture characteristics) are presented in Supplementary material. Inspection of the diffraction pattern of the alumina sample (Fig. 1 , curve 1) shows that calcination of the hydroxide at 800 °C leads to a partial transition of η-Al2O3 to the high-temperature oxide θ-Al2O3. First, there are changes in the region of 31–34° of 2θ: at the position of peak 022 (at 32.02°), which is characteristic of η-Al2O3, there are two maxima attributable to θ-Al2O3 and the overlapping peaks 400, 40 1 ¯ and 20 2 ¯ , 002 (at 31.07, 31.49 and 32.78, 32.81°, respectively). Second, the CSR size (D440, in the direction 440 of the spinel structure of η-Al2O3) increases from 6 to 8 nm (Table 1 ). Therefore, the resulting oxide can be considered as a transitional form between η-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3. According to HRTEM, the support 1-θ is a system of porous crystalline aggregates over 50 nm in size, consisting of spherical and plate-shaped alumina crystallites with a size of about 5 – 20 nm (plate thickness is 5 – 8 nm). The intercrystalline mesopores have a diameter of 2–8 nm (Fig. 2. d). Support 1-γ. After calcining γ-Al2O3 at 800 °С, no new maxima appear in the diffractogram (Fig. 3 , curve 1); however, the CSR sizes become 6 nm, i.e., increase in comparison with the CSR sizes of the initial oxide but still remain smaller than those of the support 1-θ (Table 1). The unit cell parameter becomes equal to 0.7912 nm, which is slightly less than that in the initial γ-Al2O3 (0.7915 nm). According to HRTEM data, particles of the support 2-γ are porous crystalline aggregates, consisting of particles of predominantly acicular and plate-like shapes with dimensions of d = 4–8 nm and l = 15–50 nm. In addition, the samples contain poorly crystallized particles of an irregular shape with a size of 3–8 nm (Fig. S2). 3.2 Physicochemical properties of catalysts before reaction Figs. 1 and 3 show diffractograms of supported catalysts. All the diffractograms show the maxima characteristic of the support. The diffractogram of the catalyst K1-θ-Cl exhibits peaks of the Rh2O3 phase with a CSR size of 25 nm (Fig. 1, curve 2, Table 1). After reduction, there appear metal Rh particles with a CSR size of D111 = 15 nm and with the unit cell parameter a = 0.3804 nm (Fig. 1, curve 3, Table 1). The diffractograms of the catalyst K2-γ-Cl before and after reduction (Fig. 3, curves 2, 3) contain the same phases, but the CSR sizes for Rh2O3 and Rh are 19 and 25 nm, respectively, and а440 (Rh) = 0.3807 nm (Table 1). At that, the CSR sizes and the unit cell parameters of the support after the rhodium salt deposition and subsequent reduction remain unchanged. In the case of the catalyst K1-θ-Cl, the distribution of Rh over the support surface is not uniform. As seen from Fig. 2.a-b, the surface contains large Rh particles with a size of several tens of nanometers and particle aggregates up to 500 nm, consisting of crystallites with an average size of about 10 nm. The results are consistent with the diffraction data. In some parts of the support, we have observed small areas with a size less than 1 nm having higher contrast in HAADF-STEM images, which suggests the presence of small Rh nanoparticles with a size below 1 nm. (Fig. 2.b). Fig. S3.a shows the particle size distribution. As seen, the predominant particles have a size up to 25 nm. However, some particles are larger, which gives the mass average particle size of 57.2 nm. According to HRTEM data, the catalyst K2-γ-Cl contains two types of rhodium-containing particles (Fig. 4 ). Large crystalline particles of spherical and elongated shapes have a size from 10 to 70 nm. Small particles are predominantly spherical and have an average size of 1.2 nm. According to Fig. S3.c, the particle size distribution in this sample is wider than that in K1-θ-Cl and the mass average particle size is 41.7 nm. The XPS method was used to determine the state of rhodium in the reduced catalysts. Fig. S4 shows the deconvolution of the Rh3d region of the XPS spectra of reduced catalysts. In both samples, Rh is in two states: Rh0 (Eb = 307.5 ± 0.1 eV) and Rh3+ (Eb = 310 ± 0.1 eV). Table 2 presents the ratios of atomic concentrations of elements and the percentage of two states of rhodium on the surface of the samples. The intensities of all peaks are normalized to the corresponding atomic sensitivity factors (ASF). As seen from Table 2, the surface of the sample 2K-γ-Cl contains a larger number of Rh metal particles. Residual chlorine ions are present in the catalysts as well. The XPS method shows a rather high content of Rh3+ in the samples. However, particles containing oxidized rhodium were not detected by TEM because they are reduced during the electron beam scanning to metallic Rh. The XPS method, in turn, is a surface-sensitive method. Therefore, one can assume that rhodium in an oxidized state is located on the surface of Rh metal particles. The phase containing oxidized rhodium is not detected on diffractograms due to its low content and high dispersion. The UV–vis DR spectra of the non-reduced samples K1-θ-Cl (Fig. 5. a, curve 2) and K2-γ-Cl (Fig. 5.b, curve 2) exhibit a relatively strong absorption in the range 12000–40000 cm−1 and above 13000 cm–1 respectively. In addition, the spectra exhibit a distinct fundamental absorption edges (FAE), which is typical of dielectrics and semiconductors. According to [16], the FAE for Rh2O3 is in a range of 1.3–1.4 eV, whereas, according to DFT calculations [17], the band gap of Rh2O3 is equal to 1.1 eV. In this work, we calculated that the FAE for the non-reduced samples K1-θ-Cl and K2-γ-Cl is 1.74 eV and 1.84 eV, respectively. These data confirm the formation of Rh2O3 on the surface of alumina, which is well consistent with the XRD and HR TEM data. The FAE values indicate that the catalyst K2-γ-Cl contains smaller Rh2O3 particles compared to the catalyst К1-θ-Cl. This result is consistent with the XRD data (see Table 1). In the UV–vis DR spectra of the reduced catalysts (Fig. 5.a and b, curves 3), there is a sharp rise in the background. In the case of the catalyst K2-γ-Cl, the spectrum also contains a well resolved broad AB at 22300 cm–1. When analyzing this UV–vis DR spectrum, we made two assumptions. First, the large rise in the absorption background may indicate the appearance of a conducting component in the reduced sample, which is in good agreement with the HRTEM (the reduced sample contains aggregates of rhodium metal particles) and XRD data. In this case, it is difficult to attribute the AB at 22300 cm–1 any specific particle size, since there are no published data on the plasmon resonance for Rh metal particles (in contrast to metal particles of Au, Ag and Cu) [18–20]. Second, this UV–vis DR spectrum may refer to the absorption of the unreduced part of the initial Rh2O3 phase. In this case, the FAE for this sample (1.63 eV) falls well into the interval between the calculated and experimental data considered above [16,17]. In addition, it indicates an increase in the size of Rh2O3 particles after reduction. These results allowed us to assume that a certain amount of the Rh2O3 phase remains unchanged in the reduced K2-γ-Cl sample. We believe that such a good agreement of the UV–vis DR spectra with the literature data makes this assumption quite reasonable even though the XRD and HRTEM methods failed to detect the rhodium oxide phase in this sample. In the case of the reduced sample K1-θ-Cl, the visible part of its UV–vis DR spectrum contains a distinct low-intense absorption band (AB) at 14 600 cm–1. The reason for the appearance of this band is still not clear and requires further investigation. 3.3 Catalytic studies Fig. 6 shows the results of catalytic tests in comparison with thermodynamically calculated compositions of reaction products. Methane can be observed in the products of the partial oxidation both as a result of its incomplete conversion and as a product of a side reaction — hydrogenation of CO. It is impossible to say unambiguously why it is present in the product mixture, and therefore it is incorrect to use the term ‘conversion’ for this reaction. As follows from the obtained data, the distribution of the reaction products is quite close to the thermodynamic composition. The difference from the calculated data can be associated both with the large particle size of the active component and with the presence of residual chlorine ions. The largest differences in the reaction product composition are observed at relatively low (up to 650 C) temperatures. At such temperatures, carbon may be formed on the catalyst surface, which may be the reason for a decrease in its activity. The best results are achieved with the catalyst obtained using the support γ-Al2O3. This can be associated either with a higher content of metallic rhodium in the initial catalyst or with the presence of highly dispersed rhodium particles in it. Tests with the initial alumina θ-Al2O3 showed that the support itself contributes to the composition of the target products insignificantly, and the main contribution to the conversion of methane into synthesis gas is made by the active component. It should be noted that the main reaction that proceeds on the initial support is deep oxidation, as indicated by the composition of the reaction products: a reduced concentration of hydrocarbons and a CO2 content corresponding to oxidation at λ = 0.33, where λ is the excess air ratio for fuel oxidation [21]. 3.4 Physicochemical properties of catalysts after reaction The diffractogram of the catalyst K1-θ-Cl (Fig. 1, curve 4, Table 1) shows the peaks of both metallic Rh and the highly dispersed phase of Rh2O3. The CSR size of metallic Rh in the catalyst is 50 nm. In addition, the diffraction peak of metallic Rh has a broad base, which may indicate the presence of dispersed Rh particles in this sample. The CSR size of Rh2O3 is 15 nm. The parameter of the cubic unit cell for metallic rhodium is 0.3805 nm, which means that this parameter after reaction practically does not change. According to XRD data, after the reaction, the catalyst K2-γ-Cl contains only the phase of metallic rhodium with an increased CSR size and the same unit cell parameter (Fig. 3, curve 4; Table 1). The CSR size of the support also remains the same as before the reaction, while the unit cell parameters decreased for both supports. The intensity of the peak 111 (2θ = 19º), characteristic of η-Al2O3, decreased, which indicates disorder in this direction. According to the HRTEM results, the catalyst K1-θ-Cl contains both large particles of metallic Rh with a size of about 20 nm (Fig. 2.c and d) and many small particles of about 1.5 nm uniformly distributed over the surface of the support (Fig. 2.d, S3s.b). The mass-average particle size in this sample is 64.5 nm. At that, as seen from Fig. S3.b, the size distribution of rhodium-containing particles after the reaction widens, and a significant number of particles with a diameter of 1–1.5 nm appear. Because, before the reaction, this sample contains predominantly large particles, the obtained data indicate that the reaction can lead to their redispersion. This phenomenon is observed for noble metals [7,22,23,24]. Although this phenomenon has also been observed for an alumina-supported catalyst [24], it is considered [7] rather unusual for metallic Rh supported on γ-Al2O3. Instead, it is typical for supports with high oxygen conductivity, such as CeO2. In the case of Pd [22], it was shown that metal particles were stabilized by interaction with the support. Perhaps, in our case, the redispersion of Rh metal particles is achieved by using not a low-temperature (γ-, η-Al2O3), but a high-temperature form of the support (obtained at a temperature 800 ⁰С and higher). It is also possible that a part of Rh in the initial catalyst is in the form of small particles (less than 1 nm), which are hardly visible in the images (shown by arrows in Fig. 2). These particles can mainly consist of an oxide, and thus they contain Rh3+ detected by XPS. If during the reaction these particles sinter, as in the first sample, to a size of about 1.5 nm, they become well visible. The HRTEM images of the catalyst supported on γ-Al2O3 show the presence of two types of particles even before the reaction. It can be seen that after the reaction, the size of both types of particles in the catalyst K2-γ-Cl slightly increases (Fig. 4.b, S3.d). For example, large particles can achieve 100 nm, while small ones increase to 1.5 nm. The mass-average particle size in this case is 51.6 nm. Thus, when the active component is supported on both forms of alumina, there formed two types of particles: less than 1 nm and 15–20 nm in size. Rhodium oxide is presumably contained mainly in small particles with a large surface. In the case of the chloride series sample, the reaction leads to a decrease in the absorption intensity in the range of 12000–40000 cm– 1 relative to the UV–vis DR spectrum of the reduced catalyst K1-θ-NO3 (Fig. 5.a, curves 3, 4), which indicates a decrease in the amount of the conducting component in the sample after reaction. The appearance of FAE with Eg = 1.55 eV in the visible region of the UV–vis DR spectrum for the catalyst K1-θ-NO3 after reaction indicates the presence of well-crystallized Rh2O3 on the support surface. In this case, the size of the Rh2O3 particles during the reaction increases in comparison with the catalyst K1-θ-NO3 before its reduction, and the number of such Rh2O3 particles decreases almost four-fold. In the UV–vis DR spectra of the catalyst K2-γ-NO3 after reaction (Fig. 5.b, curve 4), the AB at 22300 cm–1 increases in intensity and the absorption background in the UV region of the spectrum slightly decreases. At that, there is also a slight decrease in the FAE to 1.61 eV (within the error) as compared to the reduced sample, which indicates that the size of Rh2O3 particles during the reaction does not change, but their amount slightly increases. 4 Conclusion The paper compares the physicochemical and catalytic properties of rhodium-containing catalysts supported on two types of supports in the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons. The catalysts were investigated at various stages: before reduction, after reduction, and after their testing in a catalytic reaction. In this work, we used a frequently used support, γ-Al2O3, calcined at 800 °C and a support synthesized from bayerite, which was obtained from supersaturated aluminate solutions. It has been shown that the bayerite-type support is an intermediate form between η- and θ- alumina. In both cases, in addition to metallic Rh particles, the catalysts contain Rh in an oxidized state, which is probably located on the surface of the metal particles. According to XPS and UV–vis DRS data, rhodium in the oxidized state is retained in the samples in a certain amount even after their reduction and testing in the reaction. The use of rhodium chloride as a precursor leads to the formation of large particles of metallic Rh. In the catalyst on the γ-Al2O3 support, two types of particles with different sizes were found. It was revealed that after reaction, the composition of the catalyst on the bayerite-type support exhibits a specific feature: it contains particles of metallic Rh of about 1–2 nm in size. Such particles can be formed either due to the redispersion of large rhodium particles or due to the sintering of smaller Rh-containing particles that are undetectable in the initial catalyst because of their low content and size. Thus, when using a bayerite-type support, the active component is in a more highly dispersed state, because the sizes of both large and small particles in this case are smaller than they are on the oxide of the pseudoboehmite-type. The catalyst prepared using the pseudoboehmite-type support shows slightly better results. This may be due to the high content of metallic rhodium on the sample surface and the better stability of this state during the reaction. CRediT authorship contribution statement K.I.

        "dc:description": "Rhodium catalysts supported on bayerite and pseudoboehmite alumina, calcined at 800 °С, were synthesized and tested in the partial oxidation of methane. Rhodium (III) chloride was used as an active component precursor. The supports and catalysts were investigated by a wide range of physicochemical methods: XRD, SEM and HR TEM, XPS and UV–vis DRS. In both cases, large rhodium particles with a coherent scattering region size of 15–19 nm are formed, and small ones with dimensions less than 1 nm. On the whole, smaller rhodium particles are formed on the bayerite oxide. The catalyst with pseudoboehmite-type support shows better results in the reaction.",
