Graphical abstract Myrtenol and myrtanal find their utilization as fine chemicals or intermediates for the synthesis of food additive myrtanol. β-Pinene oxide rearrangement was studied using homogeneous Lewis and Brønsted acids as catalysts for the production of these compounds. The composition of reaction products depended on the type of active sites. Lewis active sites favoured the formation of myrtanal while in presence of Brønsted active sites undesirable perillyl aldehyde and perillyl alcohol were formed to a high extent. Optimal reaction conditions for myrtenol and myrtanal preparation were found. With 5 mol.% of anhydrous SnCl2 as Lewis acid catalysts and 1,4-dioxane as the solvent β-pinene oxide achieved total conversion with 95% selectivity to desired products. Keywords β-pinene oxide rearrangement Lewis acid Brønsted acids Myrtenol Myrtanal 1 Introduction β-Pinene oxide (BPO) rearrangement is an important reaction with respect to the obtained products, such as myrtenol, myrtanal and perillyl alcohol. The first two products are formed by opening the epoxy ring of the molecule and perillyl alcohol by both epoxy and carbon ring-opening (Fig. 1 ). These products find their utilization in the chemical industry, perfumery, food industry, etc [1,2]. The aim of this work mainly focuses on products obtained by epoxy ring-opening only, namely myrtenol ((6,6- dimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]hept-2-en-2-yl)methanol) and myrtanal (6,6-dimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]heptane-2-carbaldehyde), but since the rearrangement is more complicated the selectivity to products obtained by both epoxy and carbon ring-opening is also discussed. Myrtenol and myrtanal can be hydrogenated to a food additive myrtanol ((6,6-dimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]heptan-2-yl)methanol). Opening of the epoxy ring of β-pinene oxide can be catalysed homogeneously or heterogeneously by basic or acidic catalysts, such as NaOH modified alumina [3], lithium diethylamide [4], aluminosilicates [5,6], modified MCM-41 (Sn, Ti, Zr, Al, Si) [7], zeolites [8,9], classic Lewis [7,10] and Brønsted acids [7]. Carr et al. [11] described the use of p-toluenesulfonic acid as homogeneous acid-catalyst for β-pinene oxide rearrangement to obtain myrtanal and myrtenol. The reaction was carried out in an 80% aqueous solution of unspecified alcohol at 0 °C and provided myrtanal (17 rel.%) myrtenol (10 rel.%), perillyl aldehyde (9 rel.%) and alcohol (8 rel.%). The authors proposed possible mechanism of the catalytic conversion of β-pinene oxide to myrtenol and myrtanal by Brønsted acids. During testing of the properties of ammonium nitrates for the catalytic conversion of β-pinene oxide, the influence of Brønsted acid – nitric acid was obvious. The presence of HNO3 significantly increased the achieved conversion [12]. The reaction performed only in the presence of 65% HNO3 (5 wt.% to substrate) in N,N-dimethylformamide as the solvent, gave after 24 h myrtanal (26 rel.%) and myrtenol (31 rel.%) at total conversion of starting compound. The use of classic Lewis acids appears to be advantageous. In nitromethane, selectivity to myrtanal of 22% and myrtenol of 2% at total conversion was achieved by ZnBr2 (8.3% to the substrate) after 3 h of reaction [7]. Vyskočilová et al. [10] focused mainly on the solvent effect on product formation in β-pinene oxide rearrangement. Myrtanal and myrtenol with 64% resp. 2% selectivity were obtained using FeCl3. The highest selectivities for the preparation of myrtanal and myrtenol were achieved at 70 °C in acetonitrile and 1,4-dioxane. Most commonly, the use of heterogeneous catalysts with Lewis active sites in the mentioned reaction is discussed in the literature. Using these the high selectivities towards myrtanal are achieved. The polarity of the solvents in, which this reaction is carried out, is very variable. High conversions and selectivities to the desired products are achieved, for example, in nonpolar toluene, dioxane, but also in polar acetonitrile. However, these solvents are all aprotic. Detailed studies dealing with the comparison of Lewis and Brønsted acids to prepare myrtenol and myrtanal are missing. Therefore, to increase the knowledge about the use of classic Lewis and Brønsted acids for this reaction we have tested different ones. In this work, we have focused on the influence of the concentration of acid, its amount and possible synergic effect of the catalyst and used solvent on selectivity to desired product formation. 2 Experimental β-Pinene oxide, kindly offered by AROMA Praha, a.s., was purified by vacuum rectification using column with 20 theoretical levels (purity 75–85%). BPO conversion was calculated as the difference between BPO concentration in the starting material (CBPO0) and the concentration of BPO in the sample (CBPOt) divided by BPO concentration in the starting material (CBPO0). X = (CBPO0-CBPOt)/CBPO0 * 100 Selectivity to myrtenol, myrtanal and myrtanol was calculated as follows: S = ((Cmyrtanalt - Cmyrtanal0)+ (Cmyrtenolt - Cmyrtenol0) + (Cmyrtanolt - Cmyrtanol0))/ (CBPO0-CBPOt) * 100 Other used chemicals were purchased from different suppliers and were used as obtained without any purification. Solvents (acetonitrile, THF, toluene, and 1,4-dioxane) were stored on molecular sieves (Sigma-Aldrich, 3 Å, beads, 4–8 mesh). An appropriate amount of Lewis acid and 4 mL of solvent were inserted into 25 mL round-bottomed flask equipped by a magnetic stirrer. The flask was placed in an ice bath cooled to 0 °C. The mixture was stirred for about 10 min to dissolve the catalyst. After this, 1 g of β-pinene oxide was added dropwise to the flask for 1 min. Measurement of reaction time started after β-pinene oxide dosing. The arrangement of typical experiments with Brønsted acids was analogous. The procedure differed in the addition of the catalyst. Brønsted acids in the form of aqueous solution were added into the flask with an automatic pipette, except for p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, which is solid under standard conditions and was weighed in the same way as Lewis acids. Samples taken during the reaction were analysed on a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890 N) equipped with FID and non-polar HP-5 column (30 m, 0.32 mm diameter, 0.25 μm film). The components of the reaction mixture were identified using the gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus) coupled with a mass spectrometer (Shimadzu GCMS-QP 2010 Ultra) equipped with DB-1 column (50 m, 0.25 mm diameter, 0.5 μm film). 3 Results and discussion The rearrangement of β-pinene oxide catalysed by either Lewis or Brønsted acids was monitored. The influence of reaction temperature, used solvent and amount of catalyst was evaluated. 3.1 Lewis acids – reaction products The composition of the reaction mixture depended on the type of used acid. The products identified in the reaction mixture in the presence of Lewis acids are given in Fig. 1. Besides expected myrtanal and myrtenol, myrtanol was also formed in the reaction mixture in the presence of Lewis acids. Due to similar boiling points of myrtenol and myrtanol, their separation by rectification is problematic. However, the mixture of myrtanal, myrtenol and myrtanol may serve as an intermediate for hydrogenation to form myrtanol. In addition to these products, five high-molecular compounds have been found in the reaction mixture in the total amount of approx. 5–25% Depending on the catalyst used. By mass spectrometry analysis, it was not possible to identify them. Some of these compounds were definitely ketals and acetals formed in the reaction mixture from alcohols and carbonyl compounds in the presence of Lewis acids. In addition to these reactions, acid-catalysed aldol condensation may also take place. The decrease of nopinone (6,6-dimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]heptan-2-one) concentration (about 5 rel.%), which has been present in the starting compound, confirmed that ketal or aldol formation is likely to occur in the reaction mixture in the presence of all Lewis acids. It is likely that the products of these subsequent reactions also arose from the desired products, i.e. myrtanal, myrtenol and myrtanol. During the first experiments, it has been found that the addition of a whole volume of the substrate to the mixture of catalyst and solvent was accompanied by a very rapid heat release. Due to an overheating of the mixture, the product formation could be affected. Thus, the influence of the substrate addition rate on conversion and selectivity to the desired products was evaluated. The substrate was added to the reaction mixture from 5 s to 20 min. By comparison of results obtained after 20 min of reaction at room temperature, acetonitrile as the solvent, using 2.5 wt.% AlCl3, we have found the addition time of the substrate does not affect the resulting conversion (25 ± 1%) and selectivity to myrtanal (53 ± 1%) and myrtenol (38 ± 2%). For the following experiments, the substrate addition time of 60 s was chosen, when no overheating of the mixture was observed. When using 2.5 wt.% AlCl3, acetonitrile as the solvent, at room temperature and substrate was dosed for 1 min, the reaction course almost did not change till 20 min of the reaction. Therefore, the results of all the experiments were evaluated after 5 min of the reaction. 3.2 Lewis acids – Effect of the solvent The type of solvent influences the course of α− or β-pinene oxide rearrangement [7,8,10–16] using other types of acid catalysts than tested ones in this study. The solvent can interact with the catalyst and enable easier access of the catalyst to the substrate, provide better desorption of the product from the active sites of the catalyst, or stabilize catalysts complexes with the reaction intermediates. As discussed in literature [10], when Lewis acid is used as a catalyst the formation of organic complexes with solvent can occur. The different nature of these complexes may influence both selectivity and reaction rate. Therefore, several solvents of different polarity and basicity, which may be measured by e.g. donor number described by Gutmann [17], such as acetonitrile (ACN), tetrahydrofuran (THF), toluene and 1,4-dioxane were tested for use in combination with different Lewis acids, namely FeCl3, AlCl3, SnCl2 and ZrCl4 (Table 1 , Table 2 ). The results show that the achieved conversion of β-pinene oxide at 5th min was lower when catalysed by ZrCl4 in all tested solvents and by FeCl3 in acetonitrile and toluene. From the point of view of a central atom according to Pearson's theory [20] of hard-soft Lewis acids, all the tested Lewis acids are classified as the so-called hard ones. Especially AlCl3 and SnCl2 are very strong Lewis acids. In general, the achieved conversion was dependent on the type of catalyst and was rather independent on the choice of solvent. No obvious trend between achieved conversion and different polarity and basicity of the solvents represented by dielectric constant and donor number was observed. Higher achieved conversion when catalysed by FeCl3 could be caused by better solubility in ethers such as tetrahydrofurane or dioxane. The differences in achieved conversions in the other experiments focused on the solvent effect (Table 1) corresponded to measurement errors. Table 2 summarizes the selectivity at achieved conversions (Table 1). The selectivity is given as a sum of selectivities to all desired products, i.e. myrtanal, myrtenol and myrtanol. However, differences in selectivity were not very significant using different solvents. The selectivity to desired products was rather influenced by the type of catalyst. Higher selectivities to myrtanal, myrtenol and myrtanol were achieved when using strong Lewis acids AlCl3 and SnCl2. When catalysed by AlCl3 the selectivity to desired products was lower mainly due to the formation of high molecular products. The highest selectivity to perillyl alcohol (6%) was achieved when catalysed by AlCl3. Table 3 shows selectivity ratios of myrtanal and myrtenol at the achieved conversion of β-pinene oxide. When catalysed by FeCl3, SnCl2 and ZrCl4 slight effect of solvent polarity to the formation of myrtanal can be seen. Using the least polar solvent, 1,4-dioxane, more myrtanal was formed in the reaction mixture. The interaction between solvent and catalyst may exist. As the most suitable solvent for the preparation of myrtanal and myrtenol 1,4-dioxane was chosen. 3.3 Lewis acids – Effect of the reaction temperature Vyskocilova et al. [10] reported the total selectivity of myrtanal and myrtenol of 63% achieved in β-pinene oxide rearrangement catalysed by FeCl3 in 1,4-dioxane. The reaction was carried out at 70 °C using 10 wt.% of catalysts. In our study under the same conditions but at room temperature, the selectivity to myrtanal and myrtenol of 59% was achieved. When cooling the reaction mixture to 0 °C in the presence of AlCl3, similar results of the conversion and the selectivity to the desired products were obtained as in the case of rearrangement at the room temperature. It can be concluded that the reaction temperature in the presence of tested Lewis acids did not affect β-pinene oxide conversion and selectivity to the desired products. 3.4 Effect of Lewis acids and their amount To compare the catalytic properties of selected Lewis acids, 1,4-dioxane was used as a suitable solvent. The comparison was carried out using the amount of catalyst corresponding to 5, 7.5 and 10 mol.% relative to the substrate in order to assess the effect of the catalysts amount on the achieved conversion of β-pinene oxide and the selectivity to the desired products. Lewis acids such as AlCl3 and FeCl3 were used also in the amount corresponding to 2.5 mol.% relative to the substrate. The results are given in Table 4 . Several catalysts such as AlCl3 and FeCl3 have been tested at 2.5 mol.% in 1,4-dioxane as the solvent. Using 2.5 mol.% FeCl3 lower conversion (54%) was achieved, using 2.5 mol.% AlCl3 as the catalyst comparable results, i.e. 98% conversion and 89% selectivity to desired products was found. The further comparison of catalysts has been done using only 5 mol.% of the catalyst. Product selectivity at total conversion varies according to the used Lewis acid. It did not change as different amount of catalyst was used. The highest selectivity to the desired products at total conversion was achieved using 5 mol.% of AlCl3 or SnCl2, namely 84% or 95%. Inorganic Lewis acids are known to be highly hydrophilic and form hydrates in a solid state. Hydrates of Lewis acids are far more available than their anhydrous analogues due to less demanding production. It has been assessed whether the two Lewis acids have the same effect on β-pinene oxide rearrangement. For comparison, FeCl3, AlCl3, and their hexahydrates were chosen. The amount of the respective hydrates was calculated to be the same as in the case of anhydrous form use. When using AlCl3.6H2O it was necessary to use twice the amount of solvent to dissolve the respective amount of the catalyst. It can be seen using AlCl3 hydrate significantly lower conversion of β-pinene oxide was achieved than when the anhydrous form was used. It could be due to the lower solubility of AlCl3.6H2O in the solvent compared to AlCl3 as a higher amount of 1,4-dioxane had to be used. The second reason for low activity of aluminium chloride hexahydrate could be due to its unique structure. The hexahydrate consists of octahedral [Al(H2O)6]3+ centres and chloride counterions. Hydrogen bonds link the cation and anions [21]. The hydrated form of aluminium chloride has an octahedral molecular geometry, with the central aluminium ion surrounded by six water ligand molecules. This means that the hydrated form cannot act as a Lewis acid since it cannot accept electron pairs. Using FeCl3.6H2O, the total conversion was achieved with a 10 mol.% of catalysts related to the substrate. At total conversion using FeCl3 hydrate, lower selectivity was observed compared to an anhydrous form as perillyl alcohol and also high-molecular products were formed in the reaction mixture to a higher extent. Comparison of the selectivities to the main reaction products is given in Fig. 2 . In the presence of Lewis active sites myrtanal is formed predominantly. This finding is in good agreement with the results obtained by Corma et al. [7]. Using ZrCl4 as the catalyst the high amount of myrtanol was observed in the reaction mixture compared to the use of other catalysts. The myrtanol may be produced in the reaction mixture by e.g. disproportionation reaction. Generally, when β-pinene oxide rearrangement was catalysed by Lewis acids perillyl alcohol and aldehyde were formed with selectivity lower than 6%. 3.5 Brønsted acids – reaction products Unlike using Lewis acids as the catalysts, in the presence of Brønsted acids myrtanol and 1,5-methadien-7-ol (d, g, Fig. 1) were not found in the reaction mixture. In the reaction mixture using Brønsted acids as catalyst three high-molecular products that could not be identified were present. When the reaction was catalysed by H2SO4, 3 low-molecular compounds that were not reliably identified were also found in the reaction mixture in the total amount of approx. 10%. The selectivity to these compounds increased with the increasing amount of acid used and with its increasing concentration. Sulfuric acid has dehydrating effects and therefore these compounds are likely to be the dehydrated forms of any of the products. It also explains that the selectivity to these compounds decreased with the increasing amount of water in the reaction mixture. 3.6 Amount of Brønsted acid used The influence of Brønsted acid (H2SO4) on the achieved conversion within 5 min of the reaction was determined. 1,4-Dioxane was chosen as a solvent. Similarly, as in the case of using Lewis acid, the substrate was dosed for 1 min. To assess the effect of the presence of water on the β-pinene oxide conversion and the selectivity to myrtanal and myrtenol, sulphuric acid was added to the reaction mixture in the form of a 20% aqueous solution and in 93% solution for each corresponding amount. The selectivity to myrtanal and myrtenol with increasing β-pinene oxide conversion decreased (Table 5 ), the formation of high-molecular products such as dimers, trimers, products formed by the addition of water on double bonds (diols) and the formation of perillyl alcohol increased. It has been found the increasing concentration of the acid used has increased the selectivity to myrtanal and myrtenol. The presence of a higher amount of water in the reaction mixture using a lower concentration of acid probably caused the addition of water to reaction products to a higher extent and the selectivity to myrtenol and myrtanal decreased. Perillyl aldehyde and perillyl alcohol were formed with the same selectivity (3% resp. 18%) independently of the catalyst amount. The total conversion of β-pinene oxide was achieved within 5 min when the reaction was catalysed by 10 mol.% of H2SO4 to the substrate. Since higher selectivity to myrtanal and myrtenol was observed when more concentrated acid was used, the other Brønsted acids were added to the reaction mixture in their concentrated form and the amount of acid corresponded to 10 mol% relative to the substrate. Table 6 summarizes the results of the comparison of used acids. The acids are listed in the table by decreasing strength. The total conversion was achieved only in the presence of polyprotic acids H2SO4 and H3PO4. With decreasing acid strength, an increase in selectivity to myrtanal and myrtenol has been observed, except for acetic acid and formic acid. In their presence, β-pinene oxide rearrangement did not almost take place. However, this trend was influenced also by different amounts of water present in the reaction mixture, which also affected the selectivity. The amount of water influenced significantly the achieved conversions. The different behaviour of p-toluenesulfonic acid was caused by its use in the solid form of the monohydrate. A comparison of selectivities to the main reaction products is given in Fig. 3 . It is clearly visible that using all Brønsted acids (except for nitric acid) the main product was perillyl alcohol. Thus, these acids were not suitable for the preparation of myrtanal and myrtenol. 4 Conclusions β-Pinene oxide is an important intermediate for the fine chemicals industry. By its rearrangement, several valuable products such as myrtenol, myrtanal, perillyl alcohol and aldehyde can be obtained. Using either Lewis or Brønsted acids as catalysts results in a different composition of reaction products. In the presence of Lewis acids myrtanal is formed predominantly while Brønsted acids are not suitable for the preparation of myrtanal and myrtenol because of undesired perillyl alcohol and aldehyde formation to a high extent. We found that the achieved β-pinene oxide conversion was dependent on the type of catalyst and its amount but was independent of the choice of solvent. The highest selectivities approx. 85% to myrtenol and myrtanal at total conversion were achieved when catalysed by anhydrous AlCl3 or SnCl2.
