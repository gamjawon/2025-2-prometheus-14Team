Graphical abstract In recent work we showed that Ziegler-type nanoparticles made from [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3 are an unusually thermally stable (≥30min at 200°C), hydrocarbon-solvent soluble, high catalytic activity nanoparticle catalyst (I.K. Hamdemir, S. Özkar, K.-H. Yih, J.E. Mondloch, R.G. Finke, ACS Catal. 2 (2012) 632–641). As such, they are analogous to—and currently the cleanest and best characterized model system for—Ziegler-type nanoparticles made from Co or Ni precatalysts plus AlEt3 which are used industrially to hydrogenate ∼1.7×105 metric tons of styrenic block copolymers per year (for a review of the area, see W.M. Alley, I.K. Hamdemir, K.A. Johnson, R.G. Finke, J. Mol. Catal.: A Chem. 315 (2010) 1–27). The key question addressed in the present paper is “What is the nature of the AlEt 3 -derived stabilizer species?” for the unusually stable and active Ziegler-nanoparticles formed from [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3. Specifically tested herein are four primary hypotheses for the AlEt3-derived stabilizer(s) in the Ir(0) n Ziegler-nanoparticle system: (i) that the key stabilizer is neutral (i.e., uncharged) aluminum alkyl carboxylates following precedent from the work of Shmidt and Bönnemann; (ii) that the key stabilizer is anionic [AlEt3(O2C8H15)]−; (iii) that a key stabilizer is the AlEt3 (or its derivatives) reacting with the Ir(0) n nanoparticle surface; or (iv) that an important AlEt3-derived stabilizer is AlOAl containing alkylalumoxanes formed from any water present. The results obtained rule out (ii), but provide strong evidence for (iii), as well as evidence consistent with (i) and (iv), as stabilizers in Ziegler-nanoparticles. A pictorial scheme (Scheme 2) is provided as a working hypothesis for the stabilization mode(s) of Ziegler-nanoparticles and as a way to focus and expedite the needed additional composition and structural studies of Ziegler-nanoparticle stabilizers. Keywords Ir(0) n nanoparticles Ziegler-type nanoparticles Hydrogenations AlEt3 co-catalyst High thermal stability nanoparticles Hydrocarbon soluble nanoparticles Nanoparticle stabilization 1 Introduction 1.1 Ziegler-type hydrogenation catalysts Ziegler-type hydrogenation catalysts are formed, by definition [1], from a non-zero valent group 8–10 transition metal precatalyst plus a trialkylaluminum cocatalyst such as AlEt3. These catalysts, such as the industrial example [1,2] of Co(neodecanoate)2 plus AlEt3, are used to hydrogenate the double bonds of ∼1.7×105 metrictons/year of styrenic block copolymers, thereby removing any allylic CH bonds which greatly increases the stability of the resultant polymer towards auto-oxidation [2]. A long standing question in this area had been what is the true catalyst when one mixes the precatalysts, such as Co(neodecanoate)2 or Ni(2-ethylhexanoate)2, with AlEt3 cocatalyst? By employing a model, third-row Ziegler-type hydrogenation catalyst made from the crystallographically characterized [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 precatalyst [3] plus AlEt3, Al/Ir=1, 2, 3 or 5 [4], we were recently able to show that subnanometer, Ir(0)∼4–15 particles are formed initially from mixing [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus 1, 2, 3 or 5equiv. of AlEt3 in cyclohexane. We were also able to show, on the basis of X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS), Z-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (Z-contrast STEM), plus matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy (MALDI MS), that those initially formed Ir(0)∼4–15 particles are then transformed under cyclohexene plus H2 hydrogenation catalysis conditions to fcc Ir(0)∼40–150 nanoparticles as the faster catalysts—what we have termed “Ziegler nanoparticles” [1,4]. Post working out the needed methodology using the model Ir(0)∼40–150 Ziegler nanoparticles, analogous studies were then published revealing that industrial Ziegler-type hydrogenation catalysts made from Co(neodecanoate)2 or Ni(2-ethylhexanoate)2 plus AlEt3 [5] also yield Ziegler-type nanoparticles, but now a broad distribution of M≥4 (M=Co, Ni) subnanometer to larger particles with a mean diameter of ∼1nm. In another recent publication, the model Ir(0) n Ziegler-type nanoparticles with an AlEt3/Ir ratio of 5 were shown to be highly catalytically active, to exhibit good lifetimes of 100,000 total turnovers of cyclohexene hydrogenation, and to be stable for ≥30min at 200°C [6]. The demonstrated nanoparticle catalyst stability at 200°C appears to surpass that of any other nanoparticle catalyst in the literature [6]. It was concluded that Ziegler-type nanoparticles appear to be an unusual type of little recognized, and hence underexploited, hydrocarbon-soluble and thermally unusually stable nanoparticle catalysts, ones largely hidden for a 50-year period due to a lack of knowledge that nanoparticles are the true catalyst [1–6]. 1.2 The “what is the nature of the stabilizer?” question An important, intriguing but presently ill-understood question is what is the precise nature of the stabilization—the unusually effective, higher temperature stabilization—in Ziegler-type nanoparticle catalysts derived, for example, from [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3? The literature offers some important hints based especially on the pioneering work of Shmidt (aka Schmidt), as well as the valuable studies of Bönnemann and co-workers, who provided early evidence for nanoparticle formation, but where the nature of the best, fastest catalyst remained unclear [7–17]. Based on the results of characterization studies on Ziegler-type hydrogenation catalysts made with a metal acetylacetonate precursor M(acac) n (M: Fe, Ni, Co, or Pd) plus AlEt3 cocatalyst [7–10] (see also Section 1.1.1 and Table S1 in the Supporting Information), Shmidt and coworkers have suggested a stabilizer layer containing individual molecules of AlEt2(acac) [8] as illustrated in Fig. 1 (and listed in Table S1). Bönnemann and coworkers [11–14] have analyzed the products formed upon the reaction of Pt(acac)2 with AlMe3 and have come to conclusion that an “organoaluminum protecting shell” [11] exists and acts as stabilizer around the Pt(0) n nanoparticles; they have drawn figures [12] that are largely analogous to that shown in Fig. 1. The addition of excess amounts of AlEt3 to Co(acac)2–3 at large Al/Co ratios has been reported to result in the presence of detectable AlEt3 in the resulting Ziegler-type catalyst solution [8]. The AlEt3 has been suggested by Shmidt and coworkers as one of the main components of the stabilizer layer on the Ziegler-type nanoparticles catalyst as illustrated in Fig. 1 [8,9]. In the same reports on Ziegler-type catalyst formed from Co(acac)2·1.8H2O and AlEt3 [8,9], Shmidt and coworkers suggest that alkylalumoxanes (RAlO) n , acetylacetonate derivatives of alkylalumoxanes ((acac)RAlOAlR(acac)), and their oligomers are formed in the presence of water of crystallization in the precatalysts (see the Supporting Information Section 1.1.2 for a short discussion and additional references on alumoxanes). However, definitive evidence for, much less compositional and structural information about, the proposed alumoxanes is lacking. In short, and as the state of knowledge depicted in Fig. 1 makes apparent, more remains to be learned about the precise nature of the stabilizer(s), and their bonding interactions with the surface of the nanoparticles, in Ziegler-type catalysts. This “what is the nature of the stabilizer?” question takes on added significance given the high catalytic activity and exceptional thermal stability of Ziegler-type nanoparticles. Hence, in the current study we strive to provide some additional insights into the question of “What is the nature of the AlEt3-derived stabilizer species?” for Ziegler-nanoparticles, in the present case for the system formed from [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3. Specifically, we test herein four key hypotheses for the AlEt3-derived stabilizer(s) in the Ir(0) n Ziegler-nanoparticle system: (i) that the key stabilizer is neutral aluminum alkyl carboxylates following the Shmidt and Bönnemann precedents noted above; (ii) that the key stabilizer is anionic [AlEt3(O2C8H15)]−; (iii) that a key stabilizer is the free AlEt3 (or its derivatives) reacting with the Ir(0) n nanoparticle surface, perhaps via Irsurface Et, Irsurface H or Irsurface AlEt2 groups present there; or (iv) that the dominant AlEt3-derived stabilizer is AlOAl containing alkylalumoxanes. While one does not expect to be able to write a precise compositional, much less bonding, picture at this time for these complex nanoparticles (and since even the average, complete composition including all the stabilizers is known for only a handful of transition-metal nanoparticles [19]), the results presented herein do show unequivocally (a) that AlEt2(O2C8H15) exists in Ziegler-type hydrogenation catalyst solutions made from [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3 in benzene-d 6, and (b) that free AlEt3 is present in the highly thermally stable and long lifetime catalyst solutions at higher Al/Ir ratios (≥3equiv. Al per Ir) and that added, excess AlEt3 slows catalysis—that is, is bound at or near the Ir(0) n Ziegler-nanoparticle catalytically active site. In addition, the spectroscopic and catalytic evidence (c) rules out the presence of anionic [AlEt3(O2C8H15)]−, and (d) shows that when H2O is deliberately added, to form alkylalumoxanes or further hydrolysis products from the AlEt3 present, a rate decrease is seen but that the nanoparticles are still relatively stable (vs. the precipitation of bulk Ir(0) metal). Additionally, (e) ethane, ethene and free and coordinated 1,5-COD are formed as detectable products upon mixing [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 with AlEt3. Overall, the results rule out hypothesis (ii) (anionic [AlEt3(O2C8H15)]− as a primary stabilizer), but support hypotheses (i), (iii) and (iv) as a mixture of stabilizers for Ziegler-nanoparticles. The results are summarized pictorially in a scheme intended as a working hypothesis for the stabilization modes of Ziegler-nanoparticles. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 The hypothesis that the AlEt3-derived stabilizers are neutral aluminum alkyl carboxylates The Ziegler-type catalyst sample made from [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3 at Al/Ir ratios of 1, 2 or 3 were analyzed using 1H, 13C NMR and IR spectroscopies. A necessary change from the previous solvent of cyclohexane to d 6-benzene was used and controls were performed to ensure that the catalyst is still formed and active in benzene (i.e., and as opposed to the cyclohexane solvent otherwise used in these and our prior studies). 1 1 As shown in Fig. S1 of the Supporting information, a control experiment testing the catalytic activity of [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3 in benzene solvent at the standard Al/Ir ratio of 2 reveals an active catalyst with a maximum cyclohexene hydrogenation rate of 5mmol/h. As detailed in Section 4, the Ziegler-type Ir(0) n hydrogenation catalysts were prepared for NMR analysis from [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 and AlEt3, by adding quickly (over 2s) a benzene-d 6 solution of AlEt3 using a gas-tight syringe to a benzene-d 6 solution of [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 (Al/Ir=1, 2 or 3) at 30°C under N2. The initial orange color of the [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 solution turns dark-brown immediately after addition of the d 6-benzene solution of AlEt3, indicating the formation of Ir(0) n nanoparticles. 2 2 The observation of an immediate color change, in d 6 -benzene solvent for an [Ir] of 25mM, from orange to dark-brown is different from the color change from orange to tawny-yellow we previously observed [5] for the [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3 catalyst system at Al/Ir ratios of 1–5 in cyclohexane at an [Ir] of 0.6mM. Characterization in cyclohexane solvent using EXAFS, Z-Contrast STEM and MALDI MS on the tawny-yellow solution showed that the catalyst solution includes Ir∼4–15 clusters at that stage. The tawny-yellow catalyst solution in cyclohexane solvent changes its color to dark-brown under cyclohexene hydrogenation conditions. The dark-brown solution contains Ir∼40–150 as confirmed by EXAFS, Z-Contrast STEM and MALDI MS [4]. The dark-brown catalyst solution was then vigorously shaken for 1min and then transferred to NMR instrument while still septum-sealed and under N2. The NMR acquisition was started ca. 1h after bringing the NMR tube out of the drybox. Since experience shows that simple stoichiometry can be invaluable in comparison to even a host of most powerful physical methods in nano-materials syntheses [18–22], we started our studies by writing a plausible reaction stoichiometry based primarily on the extant literature (Tables S2 and S3) [8–12,14]. That minimal, working stoichiometry of catalyst formation is shown in Scheme 1 for [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3 catalyst at an Al/Ir ratio of 1 (and a more speculative stoichiometry involving a possible Ir4(1,5-COD)4H4 intermediate is given in Scheme S2 of the Supporting Information). The comparison of 1H and 13C NMR spectra of Ziegler-type catalyst solution at Al/Ir ratios of 1, 2 and 3 (Figs. S2–S7) to that of independently synthesized AlEt2(O2C8H15) (Figs. S8 and S9) clearly shows that AlEt2(O2C8H15) is present in the catalyst solutions. More specifically, the 1H NMR signals at 0.30, 0.80, 1.18, 1.39, 1.47, 1.57, 2.17ppm and 13C NMR signals at −0.25, 8.94, 14.33, 23.49, 26.80, 30.10, 32.52, 33.21 and 184.00ppm in the catalyst solution at Al/Ir ratio of 1 are assigned to AlEt2(O2C8H15). Similar peaks are observed in 1H and 13C NMR spectra at Al/Ir ratios of 2 and 3 (Figs. S3–S6) [23]. [An additional piece of evidence supporting the above peak assignments is the assignment, in a previous publication, of 1H NMR signals at 0.23, 0.86, 1.0–1.4, 1.30 and 2.03ppm to AlEt2(octanoate) (i.e., to the octanoate-analog of our present AlEt2(2-ethylhexanoate) [23].] The 1H and 13C NMR spectra show the presence of additional AlEt3-derived species as minor products at Al/Ir ratios of 2 and 3. Ethane, free and coordinated 1,5-COD are observed as additional products in the NMR spectra upon mixing [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 and AlEt3 at Al/Ir ratios of 1, 2 and 3, again in benzene-d 6, (see Figs. S1–S6 for detailed peak assignments). Our previous XANES study (carried out in cyclohexane) [4] shows that the Ir centers are in zero-valent state in the dark-brown Ir∼40–150 nanoparticle solution, consistent with Scheme 1. 2 2 We envisage that the proposed reaction in Scheme 1 likely proceeds via an “Ir(1,5-COD)-Et” species (Scheme S2). In order to provide further information on the formation of the putative “(1,5-COD)IrEt” species, we performed a control experiment with [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 precatalyst, but now with BEt3, since BEt3 has a stronger BEt bond than is present in AlEt3. In this experiment, the addition of d 6-benzene solution of BEt3 to originally orange-colored [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 solution did not result in any reaction as confirmed by 1H NMR spectra (Fig. S10). Absence of a reaction between [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 and BEt3 can be explained by the aforementioned, ∼74% higher BC bond dissociation energy (448kJ/mol) vs. that in AlC (258kJ/mol) for AlEt3 [24–27]. The suggested formation of a “(1,5-COD)IrEt” species is consistent with the fact that AlEt3, but not BEt3, reacts with the [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 precatalyst. Also relevant here in a general sense is that AlR3 compounds are known to be “R” donors to sufficiently strong Lewis acceptors, the crystallographically characterized [Me2Al(OEt2)2]+[MeB(C12F9)3]− from the work of Klosin et al. being a compelling case in point [28]. Returning to the AlEt3 cocatalyst system, for catalyst solutions with Al/Ir ratios of 1, 2 and 3 the 1H NMR spectra show very low intensity and sharp peaks between −6.3 and −17.8ppm (see the insets of Figs. S2, S4 and S6). These peaks would appear to be hydride resonances, attributable to IrH groups of Ir n clusters of presumably smaller, but rigorously unknown size and nature [29–33]. 3 3 The relevant literature precedent here would seem to be the observation of sharp hydride peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of mononuclear (e.g., IrH2LL′, where L=P(C6H5)3 and L′=CH3COCHCOCH3) [29], binuclear [30], and tetranuclear [31,32] transition-metal hydride complexes. In contrast, a broad hydride peak is reported for even the hexanuclear Rh cluster, [RhH2(i-Pr)]6 2+ [33]. The narrow line widths of the experimentally observed peaks would seem to be inconsistent with their assignment to hydrides on the surface of larger Ir(0) n nanoparticles [34,35]. 4 4 Hydrides on the surface of transition-metal nanoclusters are reported to exhibit broad 1H NMR signals. In a study [34] of a [Pd4phen(OAc)2H4] n (n ≈100) nanocluster (where phen is phenantroline and OAc is acetate), the broad peak observed between −20 and −60ppm has been assigned to hydrides on the Pd∼400 nanocluster's surface. Another study [35] reports that, for a 2–3nm Ru nanoparticles stabilized by hexadecylamine system, “A direct detection of hydrogen bound to Ru failed, probably, because of line broadening due to slow tumbling of the nanoparticles in solution.” Hence, the observation of low intensity single and sharp resonances in the metal-hydride chemical shift region at Al/Ir ratios of 1, 2, and 3 is tentatively interpreted as IrH resonances due to trace, low nuclearity species. Since our evidence indicates that Ir nanocluster, Ir n Et groups are formed that then should undergo facile β-H elimination, we presume that surface hydrides are also present on the Ir(0) n nanoparticles, although direct evidence for their formation is lacking at present. IR bands characteristic of carboxylate groups (Fig. S11) are observed at 1457 (strong) and 1560 (very weak)cm−1 in cyclohexane solutions of Ziegler-type catalysts at Al/Ir ratios of 1, 2 and 3. Peaks characteristic of monodentate carboxylate groups (1570–1610cm−1 and 1640–1680cm−1) [36] are absent in the IR spectra of catalyst solutions in cyclohexane solvent at Al/Ir ratios of 1, 2 and 3. Consequently, the 2-ethylhexanoate group appears to be bidentate, bridging between two Ir, two Al, or Ir/Al metal centers. An alternative hypothesis here is that anionic [AlEt 3 (O 2 C 8 H 15 )] − is formed and provides stabilization of the type known as DLVO (Derjaugin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek)-type, bound-anion-based, Coulombic-repulsion stabilization [19]. However, the comparison of 1H NMR spectrum of Ziegler-type catalyst made with [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3 in the non-polar benzene-d 6 solvent (Fig. S2) to that of independently synthesized [(n-Bu)4N][AlEt3(O2C8H15)] solution (Fig. S12) shows that anionic [AlEt3(O2C8H15)]− does not exist in the catalyst solutions. Hence, the possibility of DLVO-type, [AlEt3(O2C8H15)]− anion-based stabilization of the Ir(0) n Ziegler nanoparticles can be ruled out (i.e., assuming that any [AlEt3(O2C8H15)]− actually present was not both 100% bound to the surface of the nanoparticle and thereby broadened to a level of undetectability). This evidence against anionic [AlEt3(O2C8H15)]− is, by itself, an interesting result, one which argues that the stabilization mechanism(s) of Ziegler nanoparticles is novel in that it (or they) appear to lack the DLVO, anion-based stabilization that is very common for transition-metal nanoparticles [19]. The high solubility of the Ziegler-type nanoparticles herein in non-polar solvents such as cyclohexane is another, simple but suggestive piece of evidence arguing against the presence of charged, anionic stabilizers in the present Ziegler-type nanoparticles. 2.2 The hypothesis that the AlEt3-derived stabilizer is AlEt3 The NMR spectra of the Ziegler-type catalyst sample at Al/Ir ratio of 3 in d 6-benzene (Figs. S6 and S7) includes 1H NMR signals at 0.30, 1.11ppm and 13C NMR signals at 1.00, 8.77ppm that are assigned to free AlEt3 (0.33, 1.11ppm in 1H NMR and 1.21, 9.44ppm in 13C NMR, Figs. S13 and S14). As we have previously reported [6], excess AlEt3 (Al/Ir≥3) slows down the hydrogenation rate by, presumably, it or its derivatives binding close to or at the active site of the Ir(0) n Ziegler nanoparticles. Furthermore, the NMR spectra (Figs. S6, S7 and [6]) show presence of free AlEt3 in long-lifetime (≥100,000 total turnovers of cyclohexene hydrogenation) and highly thermally stable (stable for ≥30min at 200°C) Ziegler-type catalyst solutions made from [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 and AlEt3 at Al/Ir ratios of 3 and 5. In short, the presence of detectable AlEt3, along with its hydrogenation-rate-inhibiting kinetic effect, would seem to provide incontrovertible evidence that AlEt3, or its products with the Ir(0) n nanoparticle surface, bind at or close to the catalytically active site. As such, the evidence seems strong if not compelling that AlEt 3 —and/or its possible reaction products with the Ir(0) n nanoparticle surface, such as Ir n H, Ir n Et and Ir n AlEt 2 —are important stabilizers of Ziegler-type nanoparticles. 2.3 The hypothesis that the AlEt3-derived stabilizers are alumoxanes The studies performed by Shmidt and coworkers [8,9] on Co(acac)2–3·1.8H2O plus AlEt3 catalyst system reveal that alumoxanes [37–47] are formed in the catalyst solution under the conditions those workers employed. Importantly, for the Co(acac)2–3·1.8H2O plus AlEt3 system Shmidt and coworkers report an increased catalytic activity, and decreased stability, in the presence of water (added as n waters of crystallization) for their Ziegler-type hydrogenation catalysts made from Co(acac)2·nH2O (n: 0 or 1.8) and AlEt3 [8,9]. On the surface this would appear to be evidence that alumoxanes such as [Al(Et)O] n are not the best stabilizer of Ziegler-type nanoparticles in comparison to the parent AlEt3 Lewis acid co-catalyst. However, meriting mention here is that, in our hands (and analogous to the results reported below for the Ir(0) n Ziegler-nanoparticle system herein, vide infra), we previously reported [5] that increasing the amount of initially added water in Ziegler-type hydrogenation catalyst made with Co(neodecanoate)2 plus AlEt3 decreases the cyclohexene hydrogenation activity. Open questions, then, regarding the Co system include: (i) if the Co(neodecanoate)2 vs. Shmidt's Co(acac)2–3·1.8H2O precursors are the source of the difference; (ii) if the different amounts, methods or timing of addition of the water in the two studies are the difference—a real possibility; or (iii) if some other, unknown variable or effect is present and the source of the ostensibly different results in the Co system. Returning to the Ir system of the present studies, since a version of the somewhat hydrophobic [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 containing water of crystallization is not known at present (as a arguably preferred way to selectively add H2O and form alumoxanes), we strove to provide at least initial evidence for or against the role of alumoxanes in at least the fastest catalyst formed from [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3 by the addition of controlled amounts of H2O. Added water is known to form alumoxanes rapidly when mixed with AlEt3 [37–47], although a caveat here is that too much water will yield hydrolysis past the (RAlO) n alumoxane stage to even Al2O3. The evidence available at present on the effects of added water and any role of alumoxanes and other AlEt3 hydrolysis products is as follows: (i) the addition of 2–10equiv. (per Ir) water, to the Ziegler-type catalyst made from [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 and AlEt3 at Al/Ir ratios of 1 or 2, decreases the hydrogenation rate by ∼2–10-fold (Fig. S15); and (ii) the catalyst solution prepared in the presence of 2equiv. of water (per Ir) at an Al/Ir ratio of 1 appears dark-brown without visually observable particles—that is, is still stable with respect to the formation of bulk Ir(0) metal. Indeed, all of the catalyst solutions at an Al/Ir ratio of 2 prepared both without water, and in the presence of 4–10equiv. (per Ir) of water, appear dark-brown without visually observable particles—that is, appear stable. Moreover, (iii) the formation of the expected AlOAl bond-containing products was confirmed by the observation of a broad band between 600 and 800cm−1, although this weak band became clear only in the IR spectrum of the [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3 catalyst (Al/Ir ratio of 2) prepared with 10equiv. H2O per Ir (which equals 5equiv. of H2O per Al), Fig. S16 of the Supporting Information, so that all this may really indicate is the formation of hydrolysis products beyond the (RAlO) n alumoxane level. (iv) A control IR study of commercial modified-methylalumoxane did reveal a broad IR absorption band between 640 and 780cm−1 (Fig. S17), but (v) the broad absorption between 600 and 800cm−1 was not detectable in the IR spectrum (Fig. S16) of the [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3 catalyst prepared without deliberately added water. On the surface, these added water studies would seem to require that AlEt3 plus H2O hydrolysis products do yield a stable, albeit deactivated, Ir(0) n catalyst, although it seems likely that they may be telling us more about hydrolysis products closer to the final, Al2O3 stage of hydrolysis than the (RAlO) n alumoxane level of hydrolysis. In order to probe the alumoxane hypothesis via a different approach employing discrete materials, we synthesized Barron's well-characterized, discrete alumoxane (really a “hydroxyl, dialkyl-alumoxane analog” 5 5 Note that while even the title of Barron's paper refers to [(t-Bu)2Al(μ-OH)]3 as an “alumoxane”, it does not have the mono-alkyl composition characteristic of common (RAlO) n alumoxanes. Hence, [(t-Bu)2Al(μ-OH)]3 is probably better referred to as a “hydroxyl, dialkyl-alumoxane analog” so as to avoid confusion. (We thank Prof. Eugene Chen at Colorado State University for a discussion of this point.) However, note also that this does not detract at all from the interest in using [(t-Bu)2Al(μ-OH)]3 along with [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 as catalyst precursors given: (a) the discrete nature of [(t-Bu)2Al(μ-OH)]3, plus (b) the fact that this “hydroxyl, dialkyl-alumoxane analog” contains a t-Bu group for the reduction of the Ir(I) precatalyst as well as remaining t-Bu group (i.e., en route to the plausible (t-BuAlO) plus t-Bu initial products one writes when considering plausible reaction stoichiometries here). ), [(t-Bu)2Al(μ-OH)]3 [43], and tested it with [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2. Interestingly, (iii) the maximum catalytic activity of the catalyst made with [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus fresh-made [(t-Bu)2Al(μ-OH)]3 (Al/Ir=2) is ca. 6-fold lower (max. rate of ∼1psig/h, Fig. S20) than that made with [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus, now, the parent t-Butyl aluminum compound, Al(t-Bu)3 (Al/Ir=2) (max. rate of ∼6psig/h, Fig. S20, Table S4). Perhaps more importantly, (iv) both catalyst solutions (i.e., that prepared with fresh-made [(t-Bu)2Al(μ-OH)]3 or with the parent Al(t-Bu)3) appear dark-brown without visually observable bulk Ir(0) particles indicating that stable Ziegler nanoparticles did form from these novel precatalyst systems. Bright-field TEM images (Figs. S21–S26) and MALDI MS spectra (Figs. S22 and S25) of the catalysts made with [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus [(t-Bu)2Al(μ-OH)]3 or Al(t-Bu)3 both before and after cyclohexene hydrogenation catalysis show that the size of the Ir(0) n particles are the same (∼1nm pre-catalysis and ∼2.5nm post-catalysis) in both catalyst solutions, Figs. S21–S26. These results provide the novel insight that Barron-type, discrete “hydroxyl, dialkyl-alumoxane analogs” can yield stable, reasonably active, ostensibly Ziegler-type Ir(0) n nanoparticle catalysts. 6 6 A control experiment was performed using MALDI MS with Barron's well-characterized, discrete alumoxane, [(t-Bu)2Al(μ-OH)]3 [43] and the commonly used MALDI MS matrices, dithranol, 2′,4′,6′-trihydroxyacetophenone, 6-aza-2-thiothymine, and graphite. Perhaps not unexpectedly, the spectra (Fig. S18) did not show any peaks attributable to [(t-Bu)2Al(μ-OH)]3 or any of its plausible fragments, arguably due to reactions between these matrices and the [(t-Bu)2Al(μ-OH)]3. Similarly, the MALDI MS spectra of MMAO in 2′,6′-dihydroxyacetophenone or 2′,4′,6′-trihydroxyacetophenone matrices and using Na+ or Ag+ ionizing agents did not show any peaks that may be assigned to plausible fragments of MMAO. Hence and unfortunately, MALDI MS in at least the matrices tried is not a useful method to test for the presence of such discrete alumoxanes. As such, the above experiments provide probably some of the best current evidence that alumoxanes, broadly construed, still merit serious consideration as stabilizers of Ziegler-type nanoparticles. 2.4 X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) evidence for an IrAl Interaction, at least in the smaller Ir∼4 subnanometer clusters formed initially from [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3 It is worth noting here that our recent XAFS studies [4] provided evidence for IrAl, possibly IrXAl (X: H or Et), bonding at a distance from Ir of 2.49(2) to 2.51(1)Å (Table S5) [4], at least in the case of the Ir∼4 subnanometer clusters formed from just mixing [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 with AlEt3 at Al/Ir ratios between 1.5 and 5.0 and before cyclohexene hydrogenation. Importantly, these IrAl distances are within the range of literature crystallographically characterized IrAl distances in [Cp*(PMe3)IrH2]·AlPh3 (2.684(2)Å) [48] and [Cp*Ir(PMe3)AlEt]2 (between 2.456(1) and 2.459(1)Å) [49]. Unfortunately, the EXAFS of the larger, on-average, Ir(0)∼150 was unable to detect such AlIr interactions due to the stronger component of IrIr scatterers in the larger nanoparticles which obscures any IrAl that are present. However, one surmises that such IrAl and/or IrXAl contributions are very likely present in the larger Ir(0)∼150 nanoparticles as well based on the EXAFS of the smaller particles and the other evidence provided in this paper showing that the presence of AlEt3influences both the nanoparticle rate and stability. Noteworthy here is that we considered the possibility of Al XAFS, but rejected it as both a very challenging XAFS experiment that would, in the end analysis, yield only an average of Al coordination environments. Additional 27Al NMR experiments, ones carefully designed to (ideally) emphasize the presence of primarily one type of stabilizer, are probably a better bet for additional future research. 2.5 Survey experiments with Ir4(1,5-COD)4H4 plus AlEt3 at Al/Ir ratios from 0 to 20 Because one can write a (speculative) stoichiometry of Ir(0) n Ziegler nanoparticle formation involving an Ir4(1,5-COD)4H4 intermediate (Scheme S2 of the Supporting Information), and because we were able to prepare this novel complex and fully characterize it as part of other work [31], we performed a number of survey experiments testing if Ir(0) n nanoparticles, stabilized by only AlEt3 (or its derivatives), could be prepared beginning with Ir4(1,5-COD)4H4 plus 0–20equiv. of only AlEt3 in cyclohexane, all under our typical cyclohexene hydrogenation conditions detailed in Section 4. The experiments briefly summarized below also address the question of if the carboxylate, C7H15CO2 −, present in the [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 precatalyst, is required for the formation of stable, Ziegler-type Ir(0) n nanoparticles. As the experiments and data in Tables S6 and S8 further detail for the interested reader, in no case using 0–20equiv. of AlEt3 per Ir4(1,5-COD)4H4 were stable Ir(0) n nanoparticles formed as the sole product. Clear product solutions with visible bulk Ir(0) metal was generally the main reaction observed, except when 3 or 5equiv. of AlEt3 were used, where a somewhat brown solution implying some Ir(0) n nanoparticle formation was also seen along with bulk Ir(0) metal (Table S6). If higher, 10–20equiv. of AlEt3 per Ir4(1,5-COD)4H4 were used, then there was no reaction (the hydrogenation activity was poisoned), with no uptake of H2 being observed (Table S8). Overall, these experiments point toward the importance of the carboxylate anion in the [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 precatalyst for either the mechanism of formation or the stabilization (or both) of at least these Ziegler-type Ir(0) n nanoparticles. A control examining premade 1.0equiv. AlEt2(O2C8H15) plus Ir4(1,5-COD)4H4 was therefore also performed, but gave only a clear solution with bulk Ir(0) metal product, Table S6. The bottom line of these survey experiments, then, is (a) that an important role for the carboxylate anion is implied in the formation or stabilization (or both) of Ziegler-type Ir(0) n nanoclusters, but (b) the presence of just AlEt2(O2C8H15) is insufficient to yield stable Ir(0) n Ziegler nanoclusters, at least when beginning with preformed Ir4(1,5-COD)4H4. 2.6 A pictorial, working hypothesis for the stabilization of Ziegler-type Ir(0) n nanoparticles Scheme 2 presents a minimalistic working hypothesis based on extant literature and experimental evidence (vide supra) for the stabilization of Ziegler-type catalysts made with [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3. The presence of AlEt3, AlEt2(O2C8H15) and bidentate carboxylates are consistent with the NMR and IR data obtained in the current study (vide supra) [31]. The bidentate carboxylates may be (i) bridging two Al centers, (ii) two Ir atoms, or (iii) one Irsurface and one Al site. In addition, presence of (i) surface species such as (Irsurface) x Et plus (Irsurface)Al(Et2)Ir (where x =1–4), and (ii) surface AlEt3, as well as Et and H bridging Irsurface and AlEt2–3 centers, are consistent with the rate-decreasing kinetic effects of added AlEt3 as well as the XAFS of at least the smaller, Ir∼4 Ziegler nanoparticles. Hence, these structures are shown in Scheme 2—which again, represents a working hypothesis. Three primary lines of evidence suggests that the Al centers interact with the Ir sites on the surface of the Ir(0) n Ziegler nanoparticle surface in Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3 catalyst: (i) the XAFS precedent for the Ir∼4 clusters plus AlEt3 (Table S5); and (ii) the observation that the cyclohexene hydrogenation activity of the Ziegler-type catalysts made with [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 and AlEt3 decreases ∼30-fold with increasing Al/Ir ratios of 1–5 (Table S7) [4]. Note here that, as we have previously reported [4], the sizes of the Ir(0) n both in pre- and post-hydrogenation solutions are the same regardless of Al/Ir ratio. Hence, a AlEt3-derived component, and not a size change of the nanoparticles, has to be the main factor affecting the catalytic activity. Furthermore, (iii) 27Al NMR spectra (Fig. S27) shows upfield shift from 170ppm in neat AlEt3 sample to 0ppm at Al/Ir ratio of 1 and at 80ppm at Al/Ir ratio of 2. These upfield shifts suggest interaction of Al centers with metallic Ir atoms on the surface of Ir(0) n nanoparticles [50–58]. 7 7 The upfield or downfield shift in NMR lines in the presence of metallic species is a common phenomenon in the literature. This type of shift is called “Knight Shift”. Sinfelt and coworkers define the Knight shift as “In bulk metals, the polarization of the magnetic moments of conduction electrons gives rise to a shift of the NMR lines called a Knight shift.” [50]. Some references on experimental and theoretical aspects of Knight shift are the following: [51–57]. , 8 8 Similar upfield Knight shifts (153 and 193ppm) have been reported previously in 27Al MAS NMR Cu0.33Al0.67and Cu0.50Al0.50 alloys when compared to pure Al due to bonding to metallic Cu [51]. The 27Al NMR Knight shift observed from 1639ppm in aluminum powder to 1486ppm in Cu0.33Al0.67(i.e., Al/Cu=2) and to 1446ppm in Cu0.50Al0.50 (i.e., Al/Cu=1) alloys [51]. One should note, however, that the ppm values in the present work are from solution NMR studies and not solid-state, magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR. Another example is the observation of 310ppm downfield Knight shift in 13C NMR signal of CO chemisorbed on metallic Pd surface (i.e., Pd particles supported on η-alumina) when compared to metal carbonyl compounds [53]. The shift was attributed in the original publication to “mixing of the Pd conduction band with the CO molecular orbitals.” [53]. , 9 9 Alternatively, the signals may be interpreted by considering the effect of coordination number on Al atoms. The signal observed at 0ppm in 27Al NMR spectrum of Ziegler-type catalyst sample made with [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3 at Al/Ir ratio of 1 (Fig. S21) may be due to hexacoordinate environment around Al (hexacoordinate region: −40 to 20ppm [58]). The 27Al NMR signals are observed in tetracoordinate region (reported at 60–110ppm and 140–180ppm [58] for the catalyst samples with Al/Ir ratios of 2 and 3 (80 and 170ppm, respectively, Figure S27). One should note here that Scheme 2, admittedly still rather speculative in its structural details, is provided primarily as a pictorial hypothesis designed to focus and guide future studies. Scheme 2 is consistent with, and rationalizes, the hydrocarbon solubility of the Ir(0) n Ziegler nanoparticles; they are overall neutral, with neutral charge stabilizers, with the lipophilic 2-ethylhexanoate of the C7H15CO2 − moiety providing hydrocarbon solubility—as well as steric stabilization [19]. Surface H, Et, AlEt3 and X AlEt3 (X =H, Et) components, possible (EtAlO) n alumoxane as well as possible Ir-bridging, Et2Al-surface species, would, then and in this working hypothesis, provide additional stabilization. As mentioned in the figure caption, not shown, but also possible, is an alumoxane component containing the RCO2 − carboxylato-moiety, perhaps as a terminating group to an alumoxane chain. We emphasize that Scheme 2 is intended as a proposed working hypothesis, for future study about how Ziegler nanoparticles achieve their unusual combination of high stability, hydrocarbon solubility, plus high activity, but not as anything near the final word on the stabilization modes of Ziegler-nanoparticles. A qualitative, but telling, test of Scheme 2 is whether or not it can explain why Ir(0) n Ziegler nanoparticles have the exceptional 200°C, ≥30min stability in dodecane that is observed [6]. The surface ligands and species shown in Scheme 2 have the potential to explain the unusual thermal stability of Ziegler-type nanoparticles, perhaps especially the Ir-bridging Et2Al, any chelating (EtAlO) n alumoxane present, the surface AlEt3 and the AlEt3 with H- or Et-bridging groups, plus the steric stabilization [19] provided by all the bulky C8H15O2 groups. That said, it is still by no means completely obvious why Ir(0) n Ziegler nanoparticles made from [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 and AlEt3 in cyclohexane solvent have the high thermal stability, yet also high catalytic activity, that they do. Hence, additional tests and studies, further refining or refuting Scheme 2, are both needed and strongly encouraged. 3 Summary and conclusions The present study contributes to the area of Ziegler-type hydrogenation catalysts in that it (i) sheds some light on the intriguing question of what is the nature of the stabilization, and (ii) provides evidence for the existence of AlEt2(O2C8H15) (Al/Ir=1, 2 and 3), AlEt3 (Al/Ir=3) in the catalyst solution in the currently best-understood model Ziegler-type hydrogenation catalyst system, namely that made from [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 and AlEt3 in cyclohexane and used without aging. In addition, the current spectroscopic results (iii) argue strongly against the presence of at least freely diffusing, solution-phase anionic [AlEt3(O2C8H15)]− stabilizer, in turn revealing that classic DLVO-type, Coulombic-repulsion stabilization [19] does not appear to be a major contributor to the high stability of these hydrocarbon soluble, high catalytic activity Ziegler-type nanoparticle catalysts—and unless all that putative stabilizer is both tightly bound and broadened to undetectability in the 1H NMR. The evidence provided also (iv) points toward the possibility if not probability of alumoxane stabilizers such as (OAlEt) n formed under conditions where, for example, 1equiv. of water per otherwise intact AlEt3 is present. The spectroscopic and catalytic results also (v) show that depending on the initial Al/Ir ratio, additional AlEt3-derived species, ethane, ethene, free and coordinated 1,5-COD are formed as minor products upon mixing [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 and AlEt3; and (vii) support the expected interaction between Ir(0) n Ziegler-nanoparticles with Al-centers in the resultant AlEt3-derived species. Furthermore, in the light of current experimental evidence, we (viii) have proposed a pictorial, working hypothesis for the suggested stabilization modes within Ziegler-type Ir(0) n nanoparticles, Scheme 2. It is hoped that the results reported herein will stimulate further studies into the nature of the AlEt3-derived stabilizer component in both Ir(0)-based, but also the industrial Co- and Ni-based, Ziegler-type catalysts as a function of the Al/M (M: Co or Ni) ratios and as a function of the precise experimental conditions such as the level of water present. 4 Experimental 4.1 Materials All manipulations were performed under N2 in a Vacuum Atmospheres drybox (≤5ppm O2 as monitored by a Vacuum Atmospheres O2-level monitor) or using a Schlenk line under pre-purified, dried Ar. All glassware were dried overnight in an oven at 160°C, then cooled under vacuum in the antechamber of the drybox. NMR sample tubes were rinsed with nanopure water and then dried for 2 days in an oven at 160°C. They were then transferred into the antechamber of the drybox, cooled down under vacuum for 8h and then stored in the drybox. Benzene-d 6 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., 99.5%, w/o TMS) was used as received. Benzene (Sigma–Aldrich, anhydrous, 99.8%) was used as received. Cyclohexane (Sigma–Aldrich, 99.5%, H2O<0.001%) was dried over activated (vide infra) molecular sieves for 2days prior to use. Modified methylalumoxane (MMAO-3A, 2.2wt% Al in heptane) was purchased from Akzo Nobel. Heptane (anhydrous, Sigma–Aldrich, 99%) was degassed under Ar for 30min before use. Molecular sieves (Acros, 3Å) were activated by keeping at 200°C for 8h under vacuum (≤10−2 mmHg). AlEt3 (Strem Chemicals, 93%, in 100g steel cylinder) and BEt3 (Strem Chemicals, 98%, in 100g steel cylinder) were used as received. See Section 2.2 of the Supporting Information for a detailed discussion of procedures and cautions for handling pyrophoric AlEt 3 , Al(t-Bu) 3 , (t-Bu)Li and BEt 3 . The relatively volatile BEt3 seemed to be the source of spurious reduction chemistry observed for other research samples stored in the drybox, in particular the apparent “autoreduction” of (1,5-COD)IrCl·Al2O3 used in a different research project. Hence, the BEt3 was removed as soon as it was no longer in use (which, in turn, appeared to stop the spurious, otherwise unaccounted for, reduction of (1,5-COD)IrCl·Al2O3 stored in the drybox). Al(t-Bu)3 was synthesized as detailed in the Supporting Information. Its purity was determined by 1H NMR (δ in ppm (multiplicity): 1.10 (s)). Mineral oil (heavy, Fisher Scientific) was dried under vacuum at 60°C for 6h before use. The NaCl windows for solid sample preparation for IR were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (32mm, round) and used as received. Cyclohexene (Aldrich, 99%) was distilled over Na under N2(g) and transferred into the drybox under air-free conditions. Hydrogen gas (General Air, 99.5%) was passed through an indicating moisture trap (Scott Specialty Gas), a disposable O2 cartridge (Trigon), and an indicating O2 trap (Trigon) before use in hydrogenations. [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 was prepared by W. Morgan Alley in our labs following our previously published procedure [3] and its purity was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectra. Crystalline [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 was used to prepare a 12.0mM solution in cyclohexane or a 40.0mM solution in benzene-d 6. Pentane (Sigma–Aldrich, anhydrous, 99+%, 1L) was distilled over Na and stored in a 100mL-round-bottomed Schlenk flask in the drybox. AlCl3 (Sigma–Aldrich, Reagent Plus, ≥99.9%, 1kg) was sublimed at ∼130°C under Ar on a Schlenk line using a custom-made sublimation apparatus equipped with a side arm and containing a sublimation chamber for the crude AlCl3, plus a cold-finger (i.e., one equipped with a cold water inlet and outlet) to collect the sublimed AlCl3. The sublimation mixture was prepared using 40g AlCl3, 4g NaCl (Fisher, 3kg) and 1g Al powder (Al metal, Fisher, finest powder, 500g) as detailed in the literature [59]. Pure AlCl3 (∼7g) was collected on the cold-finger after ∼4.5h. A 1.7M pentane solution of (t-Bu)Li (Aldrich, 100mL brown glass bottle) was used as received. Celite (Sigma, diatomaceous earth, non-washed, ∼90% SiO2) was dried by heating to 200°C under vacuum for 8h and cooled under vacuum. Ultrapure H2O was prepared using a Barnstead Nanopure system. 4.2 Synthesis of AlEt2(O2C8H15) The synthesis was performed in the drybox under N2 according to a procedure published for AlEt2(acac) [15], but using a 6-fold lower concentration of the starting AlEt3 and HO2C8H15 solutions than that used in Kroll and Naegele [15]. A 36mM solution of AlEt3 (5mL) in cyclohexane was transferred using a 5.0mL gas-tight syringe into a 25mL glass vial equipped with a 5/8in.×5/16in. Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar. A 5mL portion of a 36mM HO2C8H15 (2-ethylhexanoic acid) was added dropwise (in ∼10min) to a AlEt3 solution in a 25mL glass vial using a 5.0mL gas-tight syringe, all while vigorously stirring. Upon removal of the volatiles from the solution under vacuum (≤10−2 mmHg) at 30°C for 8h, a clear and colorless gel-like liquid was obtained. Yield: 0.020g, 50%. 1H NMR in benzene-d 6 (δ in ppm): 0.33, 0.80, 1.18, 1.28, 1.39, 1.51, 2.17. 13C NMR in benzene-d 6 (δ in ppm): −1.21, 1.08, 8.90, 13.81, 22.66, 25.72, 29.84, 31.99, 50.21, 185.84. 4.3 Synthesis of Al(t-Bu)3 The synthesis of Al(t-Bu)3 was performed under Ar on a Schlenk line. The procedure was adapted from the procedure in a lab notebook provided courtesy of Prof. A.R. Barron [60,61]. 10 10 The original procedure for synthesis of Al(t-Bu)3 was published in an earlier article [61]. This original procedure by Lehmkuhl et al. was not useful, at least in our hands, since many necessary experimental details are not provided in the original publication. Freshly sublimed pure AlCl3 (15g) was transferred into a 500mL round-bottomed Schlenk flask equipped with a side arm and a 5/8in.×5/16in. Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar under N2 in the drybox. The 500mL round-bottomed flask was sealed under N2 using two rubber septa, brought out of the drybox, and connected to Ar using a needle tip inserted through the rubber septum. The 500mL round-bottomed Schlenk flask was then connected a bubbler through its side arm. A 120mL portion of pentane was added using a cannula through the rubber septum to the 500mL round-bottomed flask containing AlCl3, all while vigorously stirring. A 250mL dropping funnel equipped with a pressure-compensation tube and PTFE-plug was loaded with 200mL (t-Bu)Li under N2 in the drybox. The dropping funnel was sealed by closing the dropping valve below the liquid chamber and using a rubber septum to seal the glass joint at the top. The dropping funnel was brought out of the drybox while still under N2 and connected to a flowing Ar stream using a needle tip inserted through the rubber septum. The dropping funnel was left under a flow of Ar for 5min. The dropping funnel was connected under Ar to the 500mL round-bottomed Schlenk flask containing AlCl3 under Ar. The dropping valve of the dropping funnel was opened and (t-Bu)Li addition to the AlCl3 suspension was started while the white suspension of AlCl3 in pentane was vigorously stirred. The (t-Bu)Li addition continued for 4h. CAUTION: AlCl3 plus (t-Bu)Li yields an exothermic reaction. The (t-Bu)Li should be added dropwise while maintaining the solution at room temperature using an ice or cold-water bath as necessary. The resulting bluish-white suspension was stirred for 30min under Ar. CAUTION: A continuous flow of Ar through the 500mL round-bottomed Schlenk flask will result in evaporation of the pentane from the reaction flask due to its low boiling point (35°C). Therefore, the valve connecting the 500mL round-bottomed Schlenk flask to Ar line should be opened once every ∼5min for 2–3s and then closed immediately to avoid a continuous Ar flow. The bluish-white suspension in the 500-mL round-bottom Schlenk flask was then allowed to sit without stirring for 30min to allow solid LiCl to precipitate. A reverse filtration (see Scheme S3) 11 11 Reverse filtration is defined in J.P. Cooke's original publication [62] as “a process of filtration in which the liquid to be filtered is drawn upwards instead of flowing downwards in the usual way.” [62] was then applied to separate the liquid portion containing the desired Al(t-Bu)3 from the gray LiCl precipitate using the following technique. The top of a plastic Pasteur pipette was cut and then the cut pipette was stuffed with cotton under air. One end of a cannula was then inserted into the cotton layer through the other end of that cut pipette (i.e., the end not stuffed with cotton, see Scheme S3). The Pasteur pipette with the stuffed cotton and the cannula attached was then inserted into the three-necked 500mL round-bottomed flask containing Al(t-Bu)3 under Ar flow (Scheme S3). Separately, another 500mL round-bottom Schlenk flask equipped with a side arm was sealed under Ar flow using two rubber septa. The free end of the cannula (i.e., the end not inserted through cut pipette) was inserted through the rubber septum of the Ar filled but otherwise empty 500mL round-bottomed Schlenk flask. The Pasteur pipette was dipped into the cloudy white suspension and then a slight vacuum (≤10−2 mmHg) was applied through the side arm of the empty 500mL round-bottomed flask. A clear solution was collected in the 500mL round-bottomed flask. The 500mL round-bottomed flask containing the Al(t-Bu)3 solution in pentane was then evacuated, disconnected from the Schlenk line and brought inside the drybox while still under Ar. Next, in the drybox the volatiles were removed under vacuum (≤10−2 mmHg) in the drybox and the resultant clear solution was transferred into a 100mL round-bottomed flask with an O-ring joint on top and equipped with a 5/8in.×5/16in. Teflon-coated magnetic sir bar. While still in the drybox, the 100mL round-bottomed flask equipped with an O-ring joint was connected using a T-shaped O-ring adapter (with two O-ring joints on sides and one valve on top) to a 50mL round-bottomed flask equipped with an O-ring joint. The two round-bottomed flasks and the T-shaped O-ring adapter were sealed by closing the valve on top of the T-shaped adapter and brought out of the drybox. The two round-bottomed flasks and the T-shaped adapter were attached to a Schlenk line using the valve on the T-shaped adapter. The 100mL round-bottomed flask with clear Al(t-Bu)3 solution while under N2 was placed in an oil bath at 55°C. The empty 50mL round-bottom flask was placed in dry ice/acetone bath at −78°C. If condensation on the vacuum line occurred, a heat gun was used to slowly transfer the condensed liquid to 50mL round-bottomed collection flask. At the end of ∼3h, 20mL clear, colorless Al(t-Bu)3 was obtained (∼80% yield). Density: 0.978g/mL. 1H NMR in benzene-d 6 (δ in ppm, (multiplicity)): 1.10ppm (s). 4.4 Synthesis of [(t-Bu)2Al(μ-OH)]3 This synthesis was performed under Ar on a Schlenk line and, separately, under N2 in a drybox according to the original published procedure [43], but at a smaller scale (∼1/10 of original procedure). Briefly, while still in the drybox, 1.59mL of clear, colorless, liquid Al(t-Bu)3 liquid was transferred using a 2.50mL gas-tight syringe into a 100mL round-bottomed Schlenk flask equipped with a side-arm and a 5/8in.×5/16in. Teflon-coated magnetic sir bar. The 100mL round-bottomed Schlenk flask was then sealed using a rubber septum and brought out of the drybox while still under N2. The 100mL round-bottomed Schlenk flask was then connected to a Schlenk line through its side arm. Another 100mL round-bottomed flask containing pentane distilled over Na was sealed using a rubber septum and brought out of the drybox. A 30mL portion of pentane was transferred into the 100mL round-bottomed Schlenk flask containing Al(t-Bu)3 via cannula through its rubber septum while stirring vigorously. The 100mL round-bottomed Schlenk flask was placed into an acetone/dry ice bath at −78°C and was let sit for 30min to reach desired −78°C. Ultrapure H2O, 97±1μL, was injected in 1s to Al(t-Bu)3 solution in 100mL round-bottom Schlenk flask through the rubber septum using a 100μL gas-tight syringe. The resulting clear, colorless solution was stirred for 1.5h at −78° C using an acetone/dry ice bath and then for 2h at 25°C. The solution was cooled for 8h at −30°C. At the end of 8h at −30°C, white crystals were observed in the clear, colorless solution. The white crystals were separated from the liquid portion by transferring the liquid into a different flask using a 1.0mL gas-tight syringe. The volatiles were removed under vacuum (≤10−2 mmHg). The white crystals (∼0.25g, ∼35% yield) were stored at −30°C under N2. 1H NMR (benzene-d 6) (δ in ppm, multiplicity, assignment): 1.10, s, C(CH3) of [(t-Bu)2Al(μ-OH)]3; 2.34, s, OH; 1.071, s, C(CH3) of Al(t-Bu)3. 13C NMR (benzene-d 6) (δ in ppm): 24.69, 31.08. 4.5 Synthesis of [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-H)]4 The synthesis procedure for crystalline [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-H)]4 has been reported in an earlier publication [31]. The identity and the purity of the product were confirmed by 1H NMR in benzene-d 6 (δ in ppm, (multiplicity, number of H)): −2.89 (s, 1), 1.37 (m, 4), 2.09 (m, 4), 4.14 (m, 4) in line with the values given in earlier publication [31]. 5 Sample preparation and instrumentation 5.1 1H, 13C and 27Al NMR NMR samples of the Ziegler-type catalyst solution made from [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 and AlEt3 with an Al/Ir ratio of 1.0 were prepared as follows: in the drybox, 50μL AlEt3 (340μmol) was transferred from its stainless steel container using a 50μL gas-tight syringe to a 2 dram glass vial containing 1.7mL benzene-d 6 (200mM AlEt3 solution). In another 2 dram glass vial, a solution 40mM in Ir was prepared by dissolving 35.5mg (80μmol Ir) of [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 in 2.0mL benzene-d 6. A 0.5mL aliquot of 40mM [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 solution was transferred into a NMR sample tube (outer diameter: 5mm) using a 1.0mL gas-tight syringe. Next, 0.2mL of benzene-d 6 was transferred into the same NMR sample tube using a 1.0mL gas-tight syringe. The NMR sample tube was then sealed by first inserting a precision-seal natural rubber septum (Sigma–Aldrich) through the top of the NMR tube and then folding its flexible sleeve over NMR tube. The AlEt3 solution in benzene-d 6 (0.1mL, Al/Ir=1.0) was then injected using a 0.500mL gas-tight syringe into the septum-sealed NMR sample tube through its septum. The original orange color of the solution in the NMR sample tube (characteristic of [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2) turned to dark-brown immediately after adding the AlEt3 solution. The septum sealed NMR sample tube was shaken gently for 5min and taken out of the dry box while still septum-sealed. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were taken on a Varian INOVA-400 spectrometer. 27Al NMR spectra were taken on a Varian INOVA-300 spectrometer. Observed 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts were referenced to benzene-d 6 solvent. The 27Al NMR spectra were taken by using 14.0μs 90° pulse-width, 0.06s relaxation delay and a frequency of 78.221MHz. The 27Al NMR chemical shifts refer to the [Al(H2O)6]3+ ion in an external capillary containing 25mM Al(NO3)3 in D2O by the substitution method. MestReNova LITE-5.2 software was used for data processing. NMR samples of the catalyst solution with a Al/Ir ratio of 2.0 were prepared following the same procedure as the one given above, but using 0.5mL of a 40mM [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 solution in benzene-d 6, 0.2mL of a 200mM AlEt3 solution in benzene-d 6, and additional 0.1mL benzene-d 6 to bring the total volume to 0.8mL. For the preparation of the catalyst solution with Al/Ir ratio of 3.0, 0.5mL 40mM [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 solution in benzene-d 6 and 0.3mL 200mM AlEt3 solution in benzene-d 6 were combined without any additional benzene-d 6. An NMR sample of the AlEt3 solution was prepared using 0.1mL 200mM AlEt3 solution in benzene-d 6 plus 0.7mL benzene-d 6. The total volume of the NMR sample solution was 0.8mL in each case. 5.2 IR IR spectra were taken on a Nicolet Magna-760 FT/IR-Raman Spectrometer. 5.2.1 Preparation of solution samples The catalyst samples for IR analysis were prepared in the drybox using cyclohexane solutions of [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 (72.0mM in Ir) and 36.0mM AlEt3 solution in cyclohexane. The [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 (72.0mM in Ir) solution was prepared by first weighing 0.0319g of solid [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 using a weighing boat and then transferring into a 10mL volumetric flask containing ∼5mL cyclohexane. The resultant solution was diluted to the mark by adding cyclohexane. A stock solution of AlEt3 in cyclohexane (36mM AlEt3) was prepared in the drybox by adding neat AlEt3 (0.529mL, 0.834g/mL) using a 1.000mL gas-tight syringe into 50mL cyclohexane in a 100mL volumetric flask. The resulting solution was diluted to 100mL mark by adding cyclohexane. A 0.5mL aliquot of 72.0mM [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 solution was transferred using a 1.0mL gas-tight syringe into a 4 dram glass vial containing a 5/16in.×5/16in. Teflon-coated magnetic stir-bar. Next, 36mM AlEt3 solution (0.1mL, Al/Ir=1.0) was immediately added (in 1s) using a 0.5mL gas-tight syringe while vigorously stirring. The catalyst solution was then stirred for 30min under N2. The IR liquid cell with ZnSe windows was filled with the catalyst solution using a 1.0mL gas-tight syringe in the drybox and sealed using TEFLON caps. Then, the IR liquid cell was put in a jar, taken out of the drybox while still sealed with TEFLON caps in a jar and carried to the IR facility (∼5min). IR samples of the catalyst solutions with Al/Ir ratios of 2 and 3 were prepared following the same procedure as the one given above. For the catalyst sample solution with Al/Ir3 ratio of 2, 0.5mL of a 72.0mM [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 solution and 0.2mL of a 36mM AlEt3 solution were combined in a 4 dram glass vial. The catalyst sample solution with Al/Ir ratio of 3 was prepared by combining 0.5mL of a 72.0mM [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 solution and 0.3mL of a 36mM AlEt3 solution in a 4 dram glass vial, again all in the drybox. IR sample of 360mM modified methylalumoxane solution was prepared in the drybox by transferring 96μL of original commercial modified methylalumoxane (MMAO-3A) using a 100μL gas-tight syringe to 1.5mL heptane in a 5mL glass vial. 5.2.2 Preparation of solid samples The solid catalyst sample at Al/Ir ratio of 2 and with 10equiv. of deliberately added water was prepared in the drybox by first removing volatiles under vacuum at 30°C. The resulting black powder was further dried under vacuum for 8h. At the end of 8h, the black powder was transferred to a mortar and ground using a pestle. Next, two drops of mineral oil were added to the fine catalyst powder to obtain a paste. The mineral oil plus black catalyst paste was then transferred onto a polished NaCl plate and the second NaCl plate was placed on top of the first plate with care to keep the paste sandwiched between the two NaCl plates while manually smearing the paste into a thin film between the two NaCl plates. The assembled NaCl plates were then placed into a glass vial and sealed under N2, and the glass vial in turn place into a desiccator which was sealed, brought out of the drybox and transferred to the IR instrument. Next, the N2 flow feature for the sample holder compartment of the IR was turned on. After ∼5min of N2 flow through the sample holder compartment, the glass vial was transferred into the sample holder compartment which was now under a N2 atmosphere. The sealed glass vial was then opened and the NaCl plate assembly placed onto a sample holder. The door of the compartment was immediately closed and IR spectrum accumulation was started. This procedure was designed to ensure as air- and oxygen-free transfer of the catalyst sample to the IR instrument as possible. 5.3 Bright-field TEM, MALDI MS and XAFS The details of sample preparation and data collection procedures and the instrumentation have been published previously [4]; the bright-field TEM experimental details are on p. S7 of the Supporting Information accompanying that prior paper [4]. The IrAl bond distances determined by XAFS are reproduced for the interested reader in Table S5. 5.4 Hydrogenation solution preparation and catalytic cyclohexene hydrogenations Catalyst solutions, 1.44mM in Ir, were individually prepared in a drybox. An example procedure follows for the preparation of catalyst solution with [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 and AlEt3 with Al/Ir ratio of 1: a 2.1mL portion of cyclohexane was transferred into a new 22mm×175mm Pyrex borosilicate culture tube containing a new 5/8in.×5/16in. Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar. Cyclohexane solution of [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 (0.3mL, 12mM in [Ir]) was transferred into the culture tube using a 1.0mL gas-tight syringe forming an orange-red solution. The resultant solution was stirred for 1min at 1.0×103 rpm as measured by a Monarch Instruments Pocket-Tachometer. A AlEt3 solution (0.1mL, 36mM)—CAUTION, PYROPHORIC MATERIAL!, vide supra, In combination with flammable solvents!—was then added quickly (within 2se to the orange-red solution using a 0.5mL gas-tight syringe while vigorously stirring. The original orange-red color of the [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 solution changed to tawny yellow at the end of AlEt3 addition. Cyclohexene (0.5mL) was added using a 1.0mL gas-tight syringe and the resulting hydrogenation solution (1.65M in [cyclohexene] and 1.2mM in [Ir]) was stirred for an additional 1min. The procedure and apparatus used for catalytic hydrogenations of cyclohexene have been described in detail elsewhere [63,64]. Briefly, a culture tube containing the hydrogenation solution was placed in a Fisher–Porter (F–P) bottle equipped with Swagelok quick connects, which was then sealed and brought out of the drybox. The F–P bottle was placed in a bath set at 22.0±0.1°C. Stirring was started at 1000±10rpm using a Fauske Super magnetic stirplate and the F–P bottle was connected to a pressurized H2 line using TFE-sealed Swagelok quick-connects. The F–P bottle was purged 15 times with H2 (1 purge/15s) that has passed through an indicating moisture trap (Scott Specialty Gas), a disposable O2 cartridge (Trigon), and an indicating O2 trap (Trigon). The pressure in the F–P bottle was then set to 40psig, and then the data collection was initiated. Hydrogen pressure vs. time data was collected using a pressure transducer (Omega PX 624-100 GSV) interfaced via an Omega D1131 analog to digital converter to a PC running LabVIEW 7.0. Data was subsequently handled using MS Excel. The maximum hydrogenation rate of catalysts was calculated from each kinetic curve by a linear-least-squares fits to the data points in the highest activity (highest slope) region (R 2 ≥0.999 for the reported data). For hydrogenations with [(1,5-COD)Ir(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3, Al/Ir=2, 3 or 5, orange-red [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 solution (0.3mL, 12.0mM) was combined with a total of 2.0mL, 1.9mL or 1.7mL cyclohexane, respectively. Then, 0.2mL, 0.3mL or 0.5mL, respectively, of 36mM AlEt3 solution was added using a 1.000mL gas-tight syringe. The hydrogenation solution with only-precatalyst was prepared by mixing 0.3mL of [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 solution (12mM in [Ir]) with 2.2mL cyclohexane without any AlEt3. For hydrogenations with [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus Al(t-Bu)3 or [(t-Bu)2Al(μ-OH)]3, 0.2mL of 36mM solutions of Al(t-Bu)3 or [(t-Bu)2Al(μ-OH)]3 in cyclohexane were used. At the end of cyclohexene hydrogenation, the catalyst solutions prepared with 2, 3 or 5equiv. of AlEt3, or 2equiv. of Al(t-Bu)3 or [(t-Bu)2Al(μ-OH)]3, were still brown with no visually observable particles. The precatalyst-only solution and the catalyst solution at AlEt3/Ir ratio of 1 appeared to be clear colorless with visually observable black bulk metal particles in the solution and on the stirbar. For hydrogenations in benzene solvent, a 1.60mg crystalline [(1,5-COD)Ir(μ-O2C8H15)]2 was dissolved in 2.3mL benzene in a 20mL glass vial. The resulting orange-red solution was transferred using a 2.5mL gas-tight syringe into a new 22mm×175mm Pyrex borosilicate culture tube containing a new 5/8in.×5/16in. Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar. A 0.2mL portion of 36mM AlEt3 in benzene (Al/Ir=2) was then added quickly (within 2s) to the orange-red solution using a 0.5mL gas-tight syringe while vigorously stirring. The original orange-red color of the [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 solution changed to tawny yellow at the end of AlEt3 addition. Cyclohexene (0.5mL) was added using a 1.0mL gas-tight syringe and the resulting hydrogenation solution (1.65M in [cyclohexene] and 1.2mM in [Ir]) was stirred for an additional 1min. The hydrogenation was carried out using the procedure given above for cyclohexane solvent. 5.5 Hydrogenation solution preparation with added H2O For hydrogenations performed with [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3 at Al/Ir ratio of 2 in the presence of 2, 4 or 10equiv. H2O (per Ir), the catalyst solutions were prepared in 20mL batches with an [Ir] of 1.44mM. First, 16.4mL of cyclohexane was transferred into a 20mL glass vial containing a 5/8in.×5/16in. Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar. Next, 2.0mL of a [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 solution in cyclohexane (14.4mM) was added. A 2.1, 3.2 or 5.2μL portion of H2O was added using a 10μL gas-tight syringe to the catalyst solutions with H2O/Ir ratios of 2, 4 and 10, respectively. Stirring (1000±200rpm) was started, and then 1.6mL of AlEt3 solution in cyclohexane (36mM) was added rapidly (over 2s). The resulting catalyst solution was stirred for 5min. A 2.5mL portion of the catalyst solution was transferred using a 2.5mL gas-tight syringe into a new 22mm×175mm Pyrex borosilicate culture tube containing a new 5/8in.×5/16in. Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar. Cyclohexene (0.5mL) was added using a 1.0mL gas-tight syringe and the resulting hydrogenation solution (1.65M in [cyclohexene] and 1.2mM in [Ir]) was stirred for an additional 1min. All the catalyst solutions at H2O/Ir ratios of 2, 4 or 10 appeared dark brown without visually observable black particles both before and after cyclohexene hydrogenation.

        "dc:description": "In recent work we showed that Ziegler-type nanoparticles made from [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3 are an unusually thermally stable (≥30min at 200°C), hydrocarbon-solvent soluble, high catalytic activity nanoparticle catalyst (I.K. Hamdemir, S. Özkar, K.-H. Yih, J.E. Mondloch, R.G. Finke, ACS Catal. 2 (2012) 632–641). As such, they are analogous to—and currently the cleanest and best characterized model system for—Ziegler-type nanoparticles made from Co or Ni precatalysts plus AlEt3 which are used industrially to hydrogenate ∼1.7×105 metric tons of styrenic block copolymers per year (for a review of the area, see W.M. Alley, I.K. Hamdemir, K.A. Johnson, R.G. Finke, J. Mol. Catal.: A Chem. 315 (2010) 1–27). The key question addressed in the present paper is “What is the nature of the AlEt 3 -derived stabilizer species?” for the unusually stable and active Ziegler-nanoparticles formed from [Ir(1,5-COD)(μ-O2C8H15)]2 plus AlEt3. Specifically tested herein are four primary hypotheses for the AlEt3-derived stabilizer(s) in the Ir(0) n Ziegler-nanoparticle system: (i) that the key stabilizer is neutral (i.e., uncharged) aluminum alkyl carboxylates following precedent from the work of Shmidt and Bönnemann; (ii) that the key stabilizer is anionic [AlEt3(O2C8H15)]−; (iii) that a key stabilizer is the AlEt3 (or its derivatives) reacting with the Ir(0) n nanoparticle surface; or (iv) that an important AlEt3-derived stabilizer is AlOAl containing alkylalumoxanes formed from any water present. The results obtained rule out (ii), but provide strong evidence for (iii), as well as evidence consistent with (i) and (iv), as stabilizers in Ziegler-nanoparticles. A pictorial scheme (Scheme 2) is provided as a working hypothesis for the stabilization mode(s) of Ziegler-nanoparticles and as a way to focus and expedite the needed additional composition and structural studies of Ziegler-nanoparticle stabilizers.",
