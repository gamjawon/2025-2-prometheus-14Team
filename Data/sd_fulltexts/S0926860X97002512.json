An initial toxicity higher for thiophene than for HZS has been found for all the catalyst tested. Furthermore, in comparison with the undoped catalyst, the thiophene/HZS toxicity ratio decreases on alkalidoped catalyst. On the basis of benzene hydrogenation active sites, alkali-doping decreases both thiophene and HZS initial toxicity. Temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR) results suggest that the difference in toxicity may be explained by a layer of hydrocarbon species remaining on the nickel surface after thiophene adsorption at 200.

Introduction Addition of alkali metals to promote the reactivity or lifetime of the catalysts has been widely reported [ 1-3]. It is well known that alkali oxides can neutralize acidic sites of steam reforming catalysts thereby diminishing the propensity to coking [2 ,4].However, there is no general agreement about the influence of alkali compounds in relation to the resistance to sulfur *Corresponding author.

Thus, Anderson et al. [5] reported that potassium oxide could improve fivefold the sulfur resistance of iron in Fisher-Tropsch synthesis. Likewise, Chen and Shiue [6] found that promotion of nickel catalysts by alkali metals could diminish sulfur poisoning in contrast to Guenin et al. [7J, who reported the opposite effect for potassium doped Pt/A1203 catalysts. The influence of these additives on chemisorption and catalytic properties of metals can be interpreted either in terms of geometric or electronic effects [3,8,9]. Hence, the role of the alkali metals has been generally explained by a modification of the electronic properties of the metal due to the surface basicity and electron donor character of the added alkali metal 164 A. Diaz et al. lApplied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 163-172 [8,10]. However, in addition alkali deposition may result in site blocking or changes in the morphology of the metallic crystallites. It is difficult to discriminate [11,12]. between these different possibilities. In the present work, the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane on alkali-doped Ni/Si02 catalysts has been studied at 200. The influence of alkali on the resistance to sulfur poisoning as well as on the hydrogenolysis of thiophene on the nickel catalysts have been investigated. Nickel catalysts were prepared by impregnation on different alkali-doped silica supports. Results have been discussed on the basis of a previous characterization work [ 11 ]. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts All the catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness technique adding the required amount of nickel nitrate salt to bare silica support or to 1 wt.% alkali (Li, Na or K, respectively) doped silica. The bare Ni/Si02 catalyst has been referred to as (Si-I) and the alkali-doped catalyst as (SiLi-I), (SiNa-I) and (SiK-I). The nickel content was fixed in a 15 wt.% in all the catalyst. Prior to chemisorption measurements and catalytic testing, nickel precursor catalysts were reduced in situ at 773 K in a 150 cm 3 min-1 stream of HZ (heating rate of 8 K min-1) for 14 h. Additional information about the preparation and characterization of the samples can be found elsewhere [ 11 ]. 2.2. Hydrogen chertiisorption HZ chemisorption data were obtained at room temperature using the static method in an automatic volumetric apparatus (Micromeritics ASAP 2000C). 2.3. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analysis A CO stream diluted with helium (Pco < 5 torn) (1 torr = 133.3 Nm-Z) was used for CO adsorption measurements. The amount of CO adsorbed were computed from the spectra obtained after flushing out excess CO with Nz after subtracting a spectrum recorded before CO adsorption. Further details about the experimental methods can be found elsewhere 2.4. Catalytic reactions Reactions were carried out in a differential fixedbed reactor at 200 and atmospheric pressure. The benzene (Fluka P.A.) was first treated with Raney nickel under refiux for 3 h and subsequently distilled. It was verified that no deactivation took place during a 6 h catalytic test with benzene but without sulfur compounds. To prepare the sulfurized feedstock mixture, 5 ppm of thiophene was added to the purified benzene. The mixture was stored in two thermostated gas saturators. After reduction of the catalyst, the reactor was cooled down to the reaction temperature in a flow of argon. The reaction mixture was obtained by passing a flow of hydrogen throughout the saturators thermostated at 10 and kept at 1140 torn by means of a pressure regulator [Brooks 5866]. The benzene and thiophene partial pressures were calculated assuming that the dilute (5 ppm) thiophene in benzene behaved as an ideal solution. To calculate the saturation pressures at the saturator temperature, Antoine's equations were used [13]. Hydrogen (99.999%) was used throughout this work. Benzene conversions of less than 10% (differential reactor with respect to benzene) were obtained adjusting the weights of catalysts and the weight hourly space velocity. Reaction rate control by internal or external diffusion has been disregarded in preliminary test carried out using different catalyst particle sizes and different linear velocities at constant (W/Fa,o) (W = catalyst weight; Fa,o = molar benzene feed rate), respectively. H2S deactivation test was performed by mixing the stream of hydrogen/benzene coming from the saturators with a HZS/HZ calibrated mixture (10 ppm H2S in HZ) resulting a final H2S concentration of 0.15 ppm. To avoid H2S adsorption on the steel connecting tube, a Teflon tube was used for the HZS/HZ mixture. Likewise a Pyrex reactor was employed. The benzene to cyclohexane conversion was measured by on-line gas chromatographic analysis (Hewlet-Packard 5890) equipped with a TC detector. The conditions for the analysis were as follows: packed column 2.5% CW-20M on DMCS 80/100, injector temperature 150, oven temperature 80, A. Diaz et al. lApplied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 163-172 165 detector temperature 150, carrier gas hydrogen, 30 cm 3 min- t . 2.5. Temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR) TPSR tests were carried out after 25 or 200 thiophene saturation (in a thiophene in argon stream) of the previously reduced catalyst. Samples saturated at 200 were cooled in Ar to room temperature and the excess thiophene was then flushed out with hydrogen at 25. The samples were heated (5 min-I) in flowing hydrogen (50 cm3 min-1), and the products yield were determined by on line gas chromatography. The conditions for the analysis were: packed column SP/700 + BMEA on CHROMP-AW, injector and detector temperature 150, oven temperature 100, and carrier gas hydrogen, 30 cm 3 min-t. 2.6. Catalyst sulfur content The sulfur content of the samples was determined after TPSR with an ANTEK 701 C fluorescence sulfur system. 3. Results 3.1. Benzene hydrogenation Reaction rates for benzene hydrogenation over the reduced catalysts are presented in Table 1. A sharp decrease in hydrogenation activity is observed on adding alkali metal cations, which is in accordance to previously reported data for similar catalytic sys- Table 1 Activity of the catalysts tems [ 14-16]. The decrease of the reaction rate may be a consequence either of a lower rate per active site or of a decrease in the number of `working' sites as a result of poisoning or blocking [10,17] by alkali cations. To discriminate between these possibilities an accurate determination of the number of active surface sites is necessary. Hydrogen chemisorption is commonly used as a suitable and reliable tool for the determination of the number of active sites [ 18,19]. However, the metallic dispersion data is dependent on kinetic, energy and stoichiometry of the hydrogen adsorption which in turn depends on the degree of reduction, metal-support interaction, promoters and preparation methods [20]. The metallic dispersion of the studied catalysts calculated from hydrogen adsorption measurements, Table 1, is in excellent agreement with particle size determination estimated from conventional transmission electron microscopy (CTEM) and X-ray diffraction methods broadening line (XRDBL) [11]. The decrease in the number of HZ-accessible Ni atoms is stated for (SiLi-1) and (SiK-1) catalysts. The agreement between results obtained with the different techniques led us to believe that no changes in HNi stoichiometry took place and to assume physical blocking of the nickel surface sites by alkali cations. Turnover numbers (TON) based on hydrogen adsorption data are presented in Table 1, showing a dramatic decrease of the hydrogenation rate per active site on adding alkali promoters. Previous data [ 10] suggest that H atoms are so small that they can be adsorbed between the promoter layer and the nickel surface. So, when accessibility restrictions are present, CO adsorption has been proposed [21,22] to evaluate the number of accessible nickel Sample -rA HZ CO mol Bz/(g cat. h) At Niacc/gea a TON At Ni a /g, \" TON x 10-20 8-1 x 10-20 s-1 (Si-1) 0.27 1.52 0.30 1.52 0.30 (SiLi-1) 0.01 0.85 0.02 - - (SiNa-1) 0.08 1.70 0.80 0.73 0.19 (SiK-1) 0.03 1.33 0.04 0.76 0.07 ' Number of accessible Ni atoms per gram of catalyst determined by static hydrogen chemisorption. b Number of accessible Ni atoms per gram of catalyst determined by integrated DRIFTS spectra of CO adsorption. 166 A.

Fig. 1 shows the area of the IR bands, measured by DRIFTS, corresponding to CO chemisorption as a function of the ratio between the total number of alkali atoms added (A1kT) to the surface nickel atoms calculated by hydrogen chemisorption (Nis). The amount of adsorbed CO decreases steeply on increasing the A1kT/Nis ratio reaching zero for the lithium-doped sample where CO adsorption is negligible. The sintering of nickel particles on adding alkali canons, that is relatively small specially in (SiNa-I) and (SiK-I) catalysts (Table 1), cannot account for the decrease in CO adsorption. Indeed, nickel particle sizes remain practically unaltered on varying the nature and amount of alkali [ 11 ]. Praliaud et al. [23] established a way of determining the number of blocked Ni atoms by alkali promoters through CO chemisorption. By plotting the amount of chemisorbed CO against the A1kT/Nis ratio, a straight line is obtained for the first part of the plot. The interception of this line with the x-axis results in the number of nickel atoms blocked by the additive. In our catalyst series, Fig. 1 shows that one alkali atom inhibits 0.37 HZ-accessible Ni atoms. The number of exposed nickel atoms is then obtained by subtraction of the number of Ni atoms under the alkaline overlayer from the total number calculated from HZ-adsorption. A new set of TONS has been obtained by this way, Table 1. Once again, this new set of TONs states that the addition of alkali promoters result in a decrease of the catalyst activity per active site. Nevertheless, it may be pointed out that taking into account the benzene size and their different adsorption modes, it can be accepted that the size of the actual working sites in the benzene hydrogenation reaction must be larger than the CO adsorption sites. Alkali decoration of the nickel surface can therefore produce different sieving effects over the CO and benzene adsorption. In consequence, the decrease in the TON calculated with CO adsorption data could be due to both a decrease in the specific activity of the sites, or to an overestimation of the actual number of active sites. 3.2. HZS and thiophene deactivation The modification of the catalytic activity for benzene hydrogenation in the presence of HZS and thiophene was measured as a function of time. Fig. 2 plots for (Si-I), catalyst the activity in the hydrogenation of benzene in the presence of either thiophene or HZS.

Defining the initial toxicity as the number of Ni atoms at the catalyst surface that are deactivated by the first molecule of poison entering the reactor [24], and estimating it from the slope at the intercept of the activity vs. the total amount of poison molecules per surface nickel atom curve, it is evident that thiophene is more toxic than HZS. Toxicity data are reported in Table 2. By examining the initial toxicity for HZS (TsH) and thiophene (TTH) for the studied catalysts it can be stated that whatever the catalyst tested the thiophene/H2S toxicity ratio is lower for all the alkali-doped catalysts. 3.3. TPSR after thphene saturation Temperature programmed HZ-reaction tests were carried out after thiophene saturation at 25 of (Si-I), (SiLi-I), (SiNa-I) and (SiK-I) catalysts. In every case, the evolved products were n-butane, propane and methane. Their relative proportion depends on the nature of the alkali promoter. Figs. 3-6 show the elution pattern of the different products as a function of temperature for the studied catalysts. Two sources can be envisaged for the eluted products: (a) Adsorbed species produced as a result of the adsorbate-substrate interaction during adsorption at 25, and (b) Products generated during the thermal process by decomposing adsorbed thiophene. whatever the source, TPSR experiments are unable of differentiating between them. 167 -Butane rppane D 102 200 Ter~~o rr,-i r-e i v Cnl, Fig. 3.

The evolution pattern of these two last hydrocarbons are complex and seems to be composed of more than one peak. Promotion with alkali canons modify the elution pattern with respect to that of the bare nickel catalyst as follows: (a) The amount of eluted products sharply decreases with respect to the unpromoted catalyst, (b) The second maximum in the n-butane pattern at around 250 disappears, (c) The start of CH4 and C3Hg elution occurs at higher temperatures. It can hardly be detected at temperatures below 200, and finally (d) The maximum desorption rate for n-butane shifts from 90 to 120 for the (SiLi-I) catalyst. For establishing a comparison with the activity experiment in which the interaction of the poisoning molecule with the catalyst surface occurs at 200, TPSR experiments after thiophene saturation at 200 were carried out on (Si-1) and (SiK-I) catalysts. Only methane is eluted in this case, Fig. 7, extending its evolution range up to temperatures above 500. For the bare nickel catalyst a broad peak with maximum desorption rate at around 340 with a shoulder at 250 is observed. Potassium addition to the bare nickel catalyst results in a decrease in the amount of eluted methane. Moreover, the peak is sharper and the temperature at which the maximum desorption rate occurs is lower, 250. The evolution of TPSR products observed in Figs. 3-7 at temperatures well above the deactivation test, 200, suggest that thiophene or other hydrocarbon species remains adsorbed on the nickel surface at this temperature.

In fact, TPSR experiments could be understood as a temperature-programmed hydrogenation (TPH) of surface hydrocarbon species. In this respect, Fig. 7 shows clearly how potassium addition decrease in a significant way the temperature at which the maximum desorption rate for methane occurs. Taking into account, that the higher the temperature at the TPH spectrum of a cooked catalyst, the greater the cooking rate of this catalyst is [25], it can be deduced that K decreases the cooking rate of nickel catalyst. The use of alkali as oxides, and in particular K, in order to enhance the resistance to cooking has been widely reported [4,2,26]. The higher Ni/S stoichiometry of the adsorbed thiophene with respect to H2S is in agreement with the higher toxicity found for this molecule on nickel at 200, Table 2. This fact seems to be in agreement with the results shown in Fig. 7, in which methane evolution is detected after thiophene saturation at 200, thus proving that thiophene or carbonaceous moieties from it can remain adsorbed at the deactivation temperature used in this work. By integrating the TPSR peaks areas and considering the following stoichiometries: C4H4S + 4142 -> H2S + C4Hlo C4H4S + 514, --> HZS + C3H8 + CH4 C4H4S + 7142 - H2S + 4CH4 the amount of thiophene hydrogenolized during the TPSR experiment can be calculated. This quantity is presented in Table 3 as mg of sulfur per gram of catalyst (STPSR). Studies of the regeneration of sulfur poisoned nickel catalysts [27], suggest that the surface nickel sulfide produced by thiophene poisoning is not removed in significant amounts by thermal treatments under hydrogen. Therefore, in absence of more precise data, it can be assumed that sulfur compound are not evolved during TPSR experiments. The sulfur retained on the catalyst after the TPSR experiment as determined by chemical analysis (SR) is also shown in Table 3. These results indicate that both coincide only for the promoted catalysts after thiophene saturation at 25. The largest discrepancy occurs for the unpromoted catalyst saturated with thiophene at 25. In a previous paper [12] we have shown, that during the flushing out of the excess thiophene with HZ at room temperature, a considerable amount of butane is eluted and the corresponding sulfur remains on the catalyst surface. These results clearly demonstrate that thiophene is hydrogenolyzed over nickel catalyst at room temperature, and the discrepancies observed in Table 3 between SR and STPSR are mainly associated to room temperature hydrogenolysis of thiophene. However, it should be also noted that methane evolution (Figs. 3-7) is not complete at temperatures as high as 500. The presence of thiophene adsorbed without decomposition at such high temperatures can be postulated although this hypothesis seems to be very unlikely. Both mechanisms, room temperature hydrogenolysis of thiophene and adsorbed thiophene at high temperatures, would account for the discrepancies observed in Table 3. So, from data in Table 3 it can be concluded that alkali promotion results in the inhibition of thiophene hydrogenolysis at room tem- 170 A. Dfaz et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 163-172 perature. Similarly, at the reaction temperatures used (200), the hydrogenolysis of thiophene is also inhibited for the promoted samples as clearly stated by the STPSR/SR ratio. 4. Discussion There is a still great controversy about the mechanism of benzene hydrogenation on nickel catalysts. In particular, the respective roles of hydrogen and benzene adsorption on the reaction rate are under discussion. It is generally accepted that a weakly bound form of dissociatively adsorbed hydrogen is active in the reaction [28]. A quantitative correlation between the amount of weakly bound hydrogen, obtained from hydrogen chemisorption data, and the specific activity for benzene hydrogenation has been reported [29]. Hydrogen chemisorption measurements, in the static regime, establish that alkali addition does not inhibit hydrogen adsorption. Even though, the percentage of reversible hydrogen increases on adding alkali promoters. However, it must be pointed out that the dynamic/static ratio for hydrogen chemisorption decreases for (SiK-I) and (SiLi-I) samples [1l]. This fact could indicate that the benzene hydrogenation kinetics is controlled by the adsorption of hydrogen. Therefore, on decreasing the hydrogen coverage the reaction rate would decrease, Table 1. It is worth noting that for (SiNa-I) catalysts the ratio between the dynamic and static amount of adsorbed hydrogen is similar to that found for the unpromoted nickel catalyst, being the one with the highest activity. Planar geometry for benzene adsorption on metals is largely accepted. Thus the hydrocarbon is bonded to the metal surface via the delocalized 7r bonds of the ring. An electron transfer from the aromatic ring to the unoccupied d metal orbitals occurs in this way [3032]. Electropositive additives may act inhibiting the surface activity of benzene by increasing the electron density at the metal surface. Hence, the platinumbenzene bond on Pt(111) surfaces became weaker on adding potassium according to data by Garfunkel et al. [9]. A previous characterization study of these samples have demonstrated that alkali cations are mainly present as silicates and oxides decorating the nickel surface [11]. The ability of the alkali cations in the compounds to donate electrons to the metal surface is expected to be lower than in the case of adsorbed alkali metal atoms. In spite of this, XPS measurements have demonstrated that the electron density of surface nickel increases by adding potassium to nickel on a Ni/Si02 catalysts [10]. The electron donating nature of potassium oxide has already been considered, taking into account that OZ- in a Ni-O-alkali composite layer may give electrons more likely than K+ [10]. According to Ertl et al. [33] K-O adlayer has a net dipole moment in the direction of the surface, and as a result of this, a net enrichment in electron density at the alkali metal adlayer-Fe interface is observed. In our case, electronic effects of the potassium containing adlayer should be weak if any, since as stated by CO adsorption neither the position nor the structure of CO adsorbed bands in the IR spectrum are modified by adding alkali promoters [11]. In addition to the above described electronic effect a geometrical one has to be considered. As previously stated, the alkali containing phase is decorating part of the nickel surface [ 11 ]. Although, the structure sensitivity in benzene hydrogenation upon supported nickel catalysts remains open to discussion, some papers report a more or less marked structure sensitivity effect [34-36]. Pulse measurements [36] and magnetization data [37] reveal that only a small fraction of the nickel surface plays a part in benzene hydrogenation. It is assumed that a 7r/a transition complex [38] is actually the precursor of the defined 7r-bonded surface intermediate. This 7r/Q complex may react sequentially as in Rooney mechanism [39] with a single atom of adsorbed hydrogen at a time and the 7r-complex may react in the van der Waals adlayer simultaneously with six adsorbed hydrogen atoms according to a Rideal mechanism [40]. The Q-form, on the contrary, is at least unreactive if not inhibitive in the hydrogenation reaction [41,42]. The presence of alkali containing adspecies that partially block the nickel surface could act as poisons of the active 7r/Q intermediates by reducing the size of the active nickel ensemble. Thus, it seems to be very likely that alkali promotion results in a clear influence on the surface geometry for the adsorption of benzene as well as in the interconversion of benzene precursor adspecies. In a first estimate we used the total hydrogen uptake to determine the number of accessible nickel atoms, Table 1. However, we already discussed that this A. Diaz et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 163-172 estimate may not seem realistic concerning the true number of benzene hydrogenation sites. Hydrogenation rates has been claimed [35] as a source of actually available surface sites better than hydrogen chemisorption data, being evident that these nickel sites are the ones susceptible to poisoning during the deactivation process. On this basis, new toxicity values has been calculated and presented in Table 2. From these new toxicity data, it can be deduced that alkali promotion decreases nickel toxicity in a significant way for the two sulfur poison molecules studied. S-metal bond is essentially covalent, with a slight electronic transfer from the metal to the sulfur atom [43]. According to this, an electron-deficient character of Ni sites has been argued by several authors to improve the sulfur resistance of nickel catalysts [7,44,45]. However, alkali additives are considered as bases, they transfer electrons to the metallic phase [8,10] thus increasing the bond strength of electronacceptor molecules such as sulfur. Therefore, it is evident that our results cannot be explained by this reasoning. To clarify these differences in toxicity, TPSR experiments were carried out over HZ-reduced catalyst. In order to explain these changes two hypotheses could be used again. On the one hand, and similarly as has been described above for benzene adsorption, an electronic effect could be argued since thiophene seem to bind through the sulfur atom and the C=C 7r orbitals [46]. Note that is has been suggested that an electropositive additive could act inhibiting unsaturated molecule adsorption. On the other hand, after characterization measurements, it becomes reasonable to admit that a significant change on nickel atoms ensemble has been produced on alkali-doped catalysts. From this last hypothesis, it has been reported that thiophene adsorption on nickel is structure sensitive [47]. Hence, it was postulated that a certain fraction of the incoming thiophene is adsorbed coplanar to the surface with a Ni/C4H4S stoichiometry of 5 and that the remaining fraction is adsorbed perpendicular via the sulfur atom and effectively poisons two nickel sites per thiophene molecule [47,48]. The formation of three different TPSR products obtained could be explained in terms of thiophene hydrogenolysis products derived from different configurations of adsorbed thiophene on nickel surface [49]. iii As for HZS, previous work [50-52] have shown that it chemisorbs dissociatively. Saleh et al. [50] suggested a three-site mechanism for HZS chemisorption whereas Den Besten and Selwood [51 ] and more recently Ng and Martin [52] inferred from magnetic measurements that HZS adsorption involves four surface nickel atoms. Even though, electron transfer cannot be excluded, from nickel masked by alkali phase, it could very likely be thiophene- and HZS-adsorption hindering. This could be supported by the significant decrease observed in total thiophene and CO uptakes obtained for doped catalysts. Moreover, since thiophene, which does not decompose completely, can interact with five surface nickel atom per molecule adsorbed, it appears as a molecule with higher adsorption requirements than HZS. Therefore, these requirements agree with the higher toxicity found in this work. Besides, one can imagine some areas of nickel surface where the little nickel ensemble will give the same poison stoichiometry whatever the requirement of sulfur molecule. In other words, if the site is not too large to welcome the thiophene molecule in a coplanar configuration, a perpendicular adsorption will poison with a stoichiometry near to that of HZS. According to this, a decrease in the TTH/TSH ratio has been obtained on alkali-doped catalyst (see Table 2) with respect to that of the bare nickel catalyst. This decrease is more important for (SiLi-I), the more decorated catalyst. 5. Conclusions Since alkali-doping do not affect the total hydrogen uptake of Ni/Si02 catalyst, the sharp drop obtained for benzene hydrogenation activity has been explained as a result of a dramatic inhibition of benzene adsorption. Although, an electronic effect has been taken into account, the effect of alkali blocking a part of the surface nickel atoms for benzene adsorption has been pointed out. Likewise, the presence of alkali decoration blocks a part of nickel surface hindering the adsorption of thiophene and HZS, and then giving rise to a decrease in toxicity of both sulfur molecules. Finally, the evolution of TPSR products observed at temperature higher than that of the deactivation test (200), indicate that carbonaceous species adsorbed at the reaction temperature are present, explaining the 172 A. Diaz et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 163-172 higher toxicity found for thiophene molecule. How ever, it must be pointed out that carbon fragments removal can be promoted by alkali turning thiophene into a less toxic molecule.

Americo Vespuccio s/n, Isla de la Cartuja, 41092-Sevilla, Spain. The influence of alkali-doping of a Ni/SiO2 catalysts on the deactivation by thiophene and H2S during benzene hydrogenation at 200°C has been studied. an initial toxicity higher for thiophene than for H2S has been found for all the catalyst tested. Furthermore, in comparison with the undoped catalyst, the thiophene/H2S toxicity ratio decreases on alkali-doped catalyst. On the basis of benzene hydrogenation active sites, alkali-doping decreases both thiophene and H2S initial toxicity. Temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR) results suggest that the difference in toxicity may be explained by a layer of hydrocarbon species remaining on the nickel surface after thiophene adsorption at 200°C.
