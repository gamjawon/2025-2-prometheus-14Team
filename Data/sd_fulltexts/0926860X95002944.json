Development of heat-resistant catalysts has received considerable attention for the development of high-tempearture combustion catalysts. The use of additives such as La, Si, Ba, etc., is a promising way to improve the thermal stability of alumina-based support materials. Preparation routes also influence the surface area and the pore structure at operation temperatures. The effects were discussed from the solid state sintering mechanism of transition alumina. The authors have developed a noble alumina-based catalyst, hexaaluminate, as a thermally stable combustion catalyst, which can be used above 1200. In the second half of this review, we discussed fundamental catalytic properties of hexaaluminates and the results of practical applications to a gas turbine combustor.

Thus, combustion catalysts must retain as much surface area as possible during several years of operation at 1000-1400. In spite of the increasing demands for power generation and other industrial combustion pro- cesses, a catalyst with practical thermal stability has not been established. Highest operation temperature of methane steam reforming for hydrogen produc- tion will be less than 1000, but high pressure steam significantly facilitates the sintering of catalysts and supports. Reforming processes for increasing octane number of gasoline, or for hydrotreating of petroleum are operated under much more moderate conditions. In this case, catalytic activity is deteriorated by coking, deposition of contaminants and loss of dispersion of catalyst compo- nents, but not directly by surface area of support materials. Even in this case, however, a high surface area is desired to maintain proper dispersion of catalytic components. Thermal deactivation of catalysts has been most extensively stud- ied in automotive applications. Owing to large fluctuations of temperature, gas velocity as well as gas composition during a long operation period, the catalysts suffer from a wide variety of deactivation causes. The results of this field of study are very useful to gain insight into the development of high-temperature- resistant catalytic materials. In this review article, an attempt is made to summarize the recent develop- ment in various aspect of sintering and thermal stabilization of catalyst supports. We especially describe the development of various heat-resistant support materi- als and their application to high-temperature catalytic combustion. 2. Sintering of oxide supports 2.1. Surface area versus heating temperature Although a high heat resistance is required for catalyst materials for high- temperature processes, this is not satisfied by any of the conventional catalysts. One of the crucial problems is to suppress sintering of the oxide supports. Fig. 1 shows the temperature dependence of the surface area of typical oxide supports [1]. The surface area of metal oxide powders at high temperatures is dependent on their intrinsic properties (melting point, phase transformation) and is also influenced by some extrinsic factors (water vapor pressure, oxygen pressure, impurities) as well. Magnesia, for instance, shows a high melting point above 2500, so that the surface area is stable even at operation temperatures exceeding 1000. During phase transformation, the activated atomic diffusion, which results in sintering or grain growth, will also decrease the surface area. This can be seen for the phase transformation of transition A1203 ('y ---> or, ca. 1100) and TiO2 (anatase ~ rutile, ca. 700), which is accompanied by significant loss of surface area. These phase transformations will play a key role in catalyst H. Arai, M. Machida // Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 161-176 163 I 2OO! 7. I00 so ~ lO 5 -- A1203( 2072\"C ) i\\. '--.

In the following section, the sintering mechanism of the most commonly used support, alumina, is described from a crystallographic view point. 2.2. Sintering mechanism of transition alumina Boehmite, one of the most used precursors of alumina, is decomposed to produce transition alumina, of which crystal phase changes in the following sequence with increasing temperatures, ~/~/~ ~ 0 ~ a. From the correspond- ing variation of surface area (Fig. 2), the thermal stability of alumina supports has been discussed with regard to the phase transformation. Generally, the final transition was pointed out to be the main cause for the loss of surface area [2-5]. One reason for such a drastic sintering was considered to concern activated 181o1 a I I I I 1oo ,y, E ,~ 5o 0 f S00 900 10~ ll00 1200 1300 Temperature / ~ Fig. 2.

Machida /Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 161-176 atomic diffusion in transition to the a phase, a-Alumina is known as corundum and is the only equilibrium phase comprised of hexagonal close packing of oxygen. On the other hand, the other three transition aluminas show common structural features based on a tetragonal distorted spinel lattice. The phase transformation requires a substantial lattice rearrangement of the oxygen ion lattice and results in full recrystallization. The structure of y-alumina is expressed by the formula A18/3VMI/304, where VM is cation vacancy. Actually, however, it contains hydroxyl groups, being expressed by A12.sVM0.503.5(OH)0.5 as structural elements as proposed by Soled [6]. Burtin et al. [7] have extended the concept of this idea and described the transition aluminas and their phase transformation by an unique formula, (A1A.)2V;t Oo3_ v/2 (OHo) vVo', _ ~/2 (1) where A1 represents the aluminum ions in the trivalent sites, V~, the cationic vacancies in the divalent sites, OHo the hydroxyl group substituting the oxygen site, and Vo the anionic vacancies. This formula can describe chemical formula in the transformation sequence from boehmite (A1OOH, v = 2) to a-alumina (A1203, v = 0) simply by progressive loss of hydroxyl groups. Therefore, the phase transformation of transition aluminas can be expressed by a dehydroxyl- ation as follows; 2(OHo) ~ H20 + Oo + Vo (2) Apparently, with the progress of this process, increased concentrations of oxygen vacancies are generated in the lattice until the structure becomes nearly dehydroxylated. In contrast, cation vacancies are also included in transition aluminas with cation-deficient structure as shown in Eq. (1). The final transfor- mation from 0 to a occurs as a result of annihilation between these anionic and cationic vacancies; Vo + V~} -+ null (3) This reaction leads to the destruction of the spinel structure and subsequent drastic rearrangement of constituent ions. Schaper and coworkers [8-10] demonstrated the kinetic analysis of surface area loss of transition alumina and concluded that the phase transformation to a is preceded by sintering of transition aluminas. This means that the phase transformation occurs as a result of sintering of transition aluminas and has a minor effect on the surface area loss. With this in mind, the above model proposed by Burtin et al. [7] clearly explains the relation between sintering and phase transformation of transition aluminas. Tucker [11] demonstrated the transformation to a phase tends to begin at the neck region of sintered particles. This is consistent with the fact that such neck regions should contain abundant anion vacancies created by the removal of hydroxyl groups; i.e., formation of a H. Arai, M.

A model representing surface dehydroxylation from contact region of two adjacent particles. 165 neck region between particles generates anion vacancies due to Eq. (2). Conse- quently, nucleation of a-alumina would take place at the neck regions. Johnson [ 12] has also reported that surface hydroxyl groups come into play in the particle growth of transition alumina. According to his model (Fig. 3), particle growth occurs by successive elimination of water from two hydroxyl groups residing on adjacent particles, close to an area of contact. This generates an AI-O-A1 bond and brings more hydroxyls into adjacency. With the progress of the dehydroxyl- ation, there are necks formed between particles and, finally, small particles grow to larger ones accompanied by significant surface area loss. The phase transformation, and thus surface area loss, of transition aluminas are known to be greatly facilitated by the presence of water vapor. Therefore, catalysts exposed to high-temperature steam, such as steam reforming or auto- motive emission control catalysts, suffer from serious sintering during operation. The effect of water vapor can be also explained on the common basis of the hydroxylated structure; the role of water molecules is to maintain the surface concentration of hydroxyls, which leads to neck formation between particles. 3. Design of high-temperature resistant support materials A great number of studies have been devoted to improving the thermal stability of oxide supports. These studies can be classified into three different types of approaches for stabilizing supports: the use of additives, modifying preparation processes and creating new materials. 166 H. Arai, M.

Effect of additives Since the sintering of oxide supports occurs thermodynamically, the most convenient method of stabilization is kinetically to inhibit sintering by additives. As discussed in the preceding section, sintering of alumina is associated with the defective structure of their transition phases. Several metallic additives influence this solid reaction. In particular, the effect of additives on the surface area of A1203 support has been extensively studied to use them for automotive emission control, steam reforming and catalytic combustion. Table 1 summarizes the effect of additives on the thermal stability of transition alumina. The addition of BaO, La203, SiO2, Li20 or K20 is effective in retaining large surface areas of alumina because the additive cations occupy the surface sites or bulk sites to prevent atomic diffusion (surface diffusion and bulk diffusion) which brings about the a phase transformation. Some of these additives show a remarkably large retarding effect on the phase transformation. According to Burtin et al. [7], In3 Ga3+ and Mg2accelerate the transition to a-alumina, whereas Zr4+, Ca2 Th4+ and La3+ inhibit it. However, systematic understanding of the effect of additives has not been established yet. Lanthanum is most widely investigated as a stabilizer of transition alumina. Schaper and coworkers [8-10] pointed out the stabilizing effect of La for the first time. After calcination at 1100, for instance, the surface area of 5 mol-% La203/A1203 was ca. 50 m2/g, whereas that of neat alumina was less than 10 m2/g. They attributed the surface area loss to the sintering of transition alumina by surface diffusion, which is retarded by the formation of surface lanthanum aluminate. Oudet et al. [15] and Beguin et al. [16] confirmed the same effect in La-, Pr- and Nd-alumina systems and proposed the structure of this surface layer as coherent interface with transition alumina (Fig. 4). The coherence of the interface is due to the similarity of the oxygen packing and to the continuity of H. Arai, M.

The thermal stability of alumina is assumed to be related to the strong interaction between the two structures. the anion lattice. The thermal stability of alumina is assumed to be related to the strong interaction resulting from the coherency. In contrast, Bettman et al. [17] named the stabilization by La to La203 surface layers, which leads to decrease in surface energy, as the driving energy for sintering. Similar effects were reported for the addition of alkaline-earth or alkaline elements, but their mechanism is not discussed in detail [12]. Excellent thermal stabilization can also be attained by silica addition as reported by several researchers. Although Amato et al. [14] suggest silica addition produces a glassy surface layer, which prevents the phase transforma- tion to a-phase, recent studies have revealed a different effect in conjunction with the sintering mechanism of transition alumina. Beguin et al. [18] modified the surface of alumina with ca. 1-3 wt.-% of silica by impregnation with Si(OEt)4. This treatment produces a silica layer grafted to alumina (Si-O-Si and/or Si-O-A1, Fig. 5), which is able to fill the anionic vacancies of alumina responsible for thermal sintering. Johnson [12] also proposed that the stabilizing elements like silica would replace surface hydroxyls. Therefore, silica is most effective in improving the thermal stability in the presence of steam. More recently, alumina coated with large amounts (ca. 2.7-5.2 wt.-%) of silica was reported to maintain a large surface area even after phase transformation to a alumina (1400) [ 19,20]. Further, high content of silica results in the formation of mullite. Konan et al. [21] prepared large surface area mullite (ca. 50 m2/g at 1300) by autoclaving alkoxide precursors in a nonpolar solvent (Fig. 6). While a great deal of these studies are concerned with alumina, a stabilizing: effect of additives to other oxide supports was scarcely evaluated so far.

Dependence of AI/Si atomic ratio on the surface area of SiO2 -AI2 03 calcined at 1300 [21]. Addition of CaO, Y203 and La203 was reported to stabilize the zirconia fine particles up to 900 [22]. In the case of titania, surface area loss occurs during the phase transition from anatase to rutile accompanied by significant change of crystal structure. Since this process must involve solid state reactions and diffusion as in the case of alumina, additives are expected to affect the sintering rate. However, these materials could not be used in the range interesting for high-temperature combustion. 3.2. Preparative strategy As mentioned above, phase transformation as well as sintering of aluminas tends to begin at neck (or contact) regions which contain abundant vacancies. This model suggests morphology of particles and grain structure will affect the surface area loss rate, i.e., transition aluminas are expected to be stabilized by controlling these factors. Ishikawa et al. [23] reported that fibrous y-alumina prepared by spray pyrolysis of boehmite sol showed a a-transition temperature higher than con- ventional samples (Fig. 7) and thus retained larger surface areas up to 1300.

Fibrous alumina is most effective in retarding sintering because of the small number of contact points between the particles. The same result was confirmed for alumina prepared from supercritical drying of alkoxide-derived sol. Tsutsumi et al. [24] have developed a new idea of microstructural control of porous alumina by means of a molecular template. They prepared multi-layered alumina thin films by incorporating fine powders of ~/-alumina into a cast film consisting of bilayer-forming ammonium amphiphile. The surface area of the template-synthesized film was retained for ca. 100 m2/g after heating at 1500 (Fig. 8). This is quite interesting because such a large surface area can be attained even after phase transformation to a-alumina. As shown in Fig. 1, magnesia is also a possible support material with high thermal stability exceeding that of alumina. Hashimoto and coworkers [25,26] represented that preparation of MgO from gas phase oxidation of Mg vapor. As-prepared MgO consists of heat-stable ultrafine single crystals of which the surface area is as large as 72 m2/g after calcination at 1500 (Fig. 9).

Novel support materials for high-temperature uses Recently, it has been revealed that some additives (alkali, alkaline earth, and rare earth metal oxides) to alumina lead to the formation of a hexaaluminate phase, which possesses a high heat resistance against sintering at high tempera- tures (Table 2) [27-29]. This material retained a surface area of ca. 10 m2/g after 5 h of calcination at 1600. The large surface area can be always retained mirror plane spinel block ~I~'- \" mirror plane K~- (.)

Machida /Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 161-176 171 when the hexaaluminate structure is formed. Hexaaluminates known as /3- alumina or magnetoplumbite-type belong to the hexagonal layered structural family (Fig. 10), which comprises spinel-like blocks separated by a mirror plane containing large cations. According to the layered structure, the crystal growth along the c axis is strongly suppressed, i.e., crystal growth by stacking of each spinel block along the c axis is very slow [30]. This anisotropic crystal growth appears to be the reason why the hexaaluminate can retain a large surface area at elevated temperatures. Hexaaluminates partially substituted by transition metals have been studied for their application in high-temperature combustion catalyst [31-33]. In particu- lar, Mn substituted hexaaluminates show catalytic activity for methane combus- tion. It is noted that thermal stability of this catalyst is comparable to that of unsubstituted samples, because the single phase of hexaaluminate structure is retained. This is in complete contrast to conventional supported catalysts, which are deteriorated due to solid reactions between catalyst and support. The catalytic activity is further enhanced by substitution of large cations (alkaline earth or rare earth metals); Ba0.sK02MnAlllOl9 and La0.sSr0.2MnAlllOl9 at- tained the highest activity. This group of materials appears to be particularly promising for combustion applications as described in the following section because of their excellent high-temperature stability. 4. Application of hexaaluminates to high-temperature combustion Catalytic combustion has been proposed and developed as a method of promoting efficient combustion of lean fuel-air mixture with minimal pollutant formation [34-38]. Thermal NOx emission can be drastically reduced because the peak temperature above 2000 in a conventional flame combustor can be reduced by the lean-premixed combustion stabilized by the catalytic surface reaction without lowering the combustor performance. For the industrial applica- tion of catalytic combustion, such as gas turbines, boilers and jet engines, the development of thermally stable catalyst materials is the most crucial problem. The authors' research group has revealed that the hexaaluminate compounds show excellent thermal stability above 1200. The retention of a large surface area at the combustion operation temperatures is the advantageous feature for supports used as combustion catalysts. In this section, typical combustion performance of hexaaluminates is described to demonstrate the up-to-date stage of development of combustor application. 4.1. Catalytic combustion over honeycomb catalysts [39] First, combustion performance of hexaaluminate honeycombs was evaluated in comparison with those of conventional perovskite oxide catalysts.

A honeycomb catalyst of hexaaluminate was fabricated by extrusion of the powder sample and subsequent calcination. Perovskite oxides were prepared by calcination of the corresponding metal acetates at 850 in air. A perovskite oxides/water slurry was coated onto cordierite honeycomb sub- strates. The loaded amount of perovskite oxides was 10 wt.-% of the honeycomb substrate. Surface area and catalytic activity of the catalyst powders are summarized in Table 3. The catalytic activities of perovskite oxides containing Co or Mn exceed manganese-substituted hexaaluminate, Ba0.8 K 0.2 MnA11 ~O 19, especially in low-temperature catalytic combustion. However, the surface area of per- ovskite oxides ranging 3 to 5 m2/g after calcination at 850 decreased to less than 1 m2/g after calcination at 1000. On the other hand, the hexaaluminate catalyst maintained a large surface area, above 20 m2/g, at 1300. The monolithic honeycombs of these catalysts have the same geometry, i.e., 30 mm in diameter, 30 mm in length and 225/in.2 cells. After premixing heated air (650) and methane, the mixture (CH4, 3 vol.-%, air 97 vol.-%) was fed to the honeycomb catalyst at space velocity = 410000 h-1 (relative velocity = 3.4 m/s). The temperatures at the catalyst inlet and outlet were measured during the combustion reaction (Fig. 11). The inlet temperature increased drastically as soon as feeding a preheated fuel/air mixture was started and reached a maximum after ca. 15 min of reaction. The temperature of the honeycomb catalysts was reflected by differences in the catalytic activity of these catalysts, i.e., the supported La0.6Sro.aMnO3 catalyst showed the highest maximum tem- perature. After reaching the maximum temperature, however, the inlet tempera ture decreased more steeply. The difference of temperature profiles is more drastic at the catalyst outlet. Over the hexaaluminate catalyst, stable surface reaction initiated gas phase reaction was characterized by a steep rise in temperature up to 1200. During 25 h of operation, no deactivation was observed for the hexaaluminate catalysts. In contrast, the temperature at the outlet of the supported perovskite catalysts decreased significantly after reaching their maxima, because the gas phase reaction was hardly maintained. H. Arai, M.

CH4 3 vol.-%, air 97 vol.-%, SV = 410000 h- ~, gas preheating temperature 650. Under the reaction conditions of this case, a temperature of ca. 900, which should be supplied by the catalytic surface reaction, is necessary for. the initiation of the gas phase reaction. Although perovskite oxides possess potential catalytic activity required for the initiation of the gas phase reaction, their thermal stability seems not to be enough to maintain the activity at such high temperatures. Thermal deactivation of supported perovskite catalyst resulted from the sintering of perovskite powders and the solid state reaction between the coated perovskite layer and the cordierite substrate as revealed from EDX/SEM analysis. 4.2. Catalytic combustor performance of hexaaluminate catalyst [40] A catalytic combustor composed of hexaaluminate honeycomb has been developed in cooperation with Catalysts and Chemicals Inc., Far East, Osaka Gas Co. Ltd. and Kobe Steel Ltd. Fig. 12 shows the experimental configuration of adiabatic catalytic combustor composed of the 7 monolithic honeycombs in series. At the front end of the catalyst zone, a Pd/Al203/cordierite catalyst was employed due to the low light-off temperatures. A fuel (natural gas)fair mixture was fed to a catalyst zone through precombustion and premixing zones. Fig. 13 shows the combustion performance at various fuel concentrations under atmo- spheric pressure. When the relatively high concentration (2.9 vol.-%) of fuel mixture was utilized, a high combustion efficiency above 99% was attained at the practical reference gas velocity, 10 m/s. As shown in the temperature distribution in the catalyst zone (Fig. 14), the combustion temperature increased steeply in the axial direction to the maximum at the end of the 5th honeycomb. The maximum temperature was ca. 1200 at 2.9 vol.-% of fuel. Almost complete fuel combustion efficiency was maintained during 1500 h of continuous combustion operation. In this run, inlet gas was 174 H. Arai, M.

Conclusions Increasing demands of catalysts for energy conversion and/or environmental protection require excellent reliability under severe reaction conditions. In this sense, thermal stabilization of catalyst supports is a serious problem when developing these catalytic materials. As described in this review, much has been achieved concerning fundamental understanding of the sintering mechanism and the thermal stabilization of alumina-based materials during the last decade. Further efforts in developing material design and preparation methods will achieve novel support materials with potentially higher thermal stability and low costs. For practical use, in addition, the solid interactions of support and catalyst are important as sources of deactivation, which are not included in this article. Combustion catalysts, for instance, will comprise some different types of honeycomb catalysts along the axial direction of a combustor. This means reaction, temperature, and, thus, causes of deactivation depend strongly on the position of the catalyst. Attention must, therefore, be focused on development as well as evaluation of such integrated catalyst materials. References [1] H. Arai and M. Machida, Catal. Today, 10 (1991) 81. [2] D.

Development of heat-resistant catalysts has received considerable attention for the development of high-tempearture combustion catalysts. The use of additives such as La, Si, Ba, etc., is a promising way to improve the thermal stability of alumina-based support materials. Preparation routes also influence the surface area and the pore structure at operation temperatures. The effects were discussed from the solid state sintering mechanism of transition alumina. The authors have developed a noble alumina-based catalyst, hexaaluminate, as a thermally stable combustion catalyst, which can be used above 1200°C. In the second half of this review, we discussed fundamental catalytic properties of hexaaluminates and the results of practical applications to a gas turbine combustor.
