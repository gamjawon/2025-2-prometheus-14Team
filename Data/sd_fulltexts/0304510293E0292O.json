Kelly, William R. Patterson, John J. Rooney* School of Chemistry, The Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast BT9 SAG, Northern Ireland, UK (Received August 31, 1993; accepted October 27, 1993) Abstract The mechanisms of exchange reactions of paraffins with deuterium on transition metal catalysts are briefly reviewed with an emphasis on those of ethane and cyclopentane on platinum. Convincing arguments are presented to show that the reactive sites are individual coordinatively highly unsaturated metal atoms such as those at corners, edges and on terraces, and thus relatively few in numbers. A key intermediate for multiple exchange formed on those sites is 7r-bonded alkene which exhibits a considerable degree of mobility including roll-over and inter-site transfer subsequent to the rupture of the weak metal-olefin 7r-bond. Mobility of transients is therefore a complicating factor which helps to explain the variety of features noted in initial deuteroisomer distributions, without requiring more than two or three fundamentally distinct types of single atom sites. An additional variable governing the relative rates of the various steps, including interconversion of a-bonded alkyl and 7r-bonded olefin, is the electron density at each type of site. This can be varied for a given metal by dispersion, support effects, alloying and dopants. Key words: deuterium; intermediates; olefins; paraffins; platinum 1. Introduction The exchange reactions of paraffins with DZ constitute a very valuable chemical probe approach to an understanding of the mechanisms and active surface sites involved in various hydrocarbon transformations on transition metal catalysts [ 1 ] . In particular the exchange reactions of ethane and cyclopentane on metals in the form of powders [ 2 ] films [ 3 ] or supported on y-A1203 [4], S'OZ and zeolites [5] and Ti02 [6] have been examined by *Corresponding author; fax.

A fundamental general mechanism for the former was recognised which involves the interconversion of adsorbed alkyl and 1,2-diadsorbed alkene. This mechanism (the ass process) was usually written as shown in Scheme l where the asterisk merely symbolises a surface a- bonding valency (X = H or D). Reactions were carried out using a large excess of DZ. Consequently, the kinetics and statistics conformed to the requirement that a large pool of immediately available D atoms was present and it was tacitly assumed that this pool existed on the surface with rates of interchange of H and D adatoms exceeding those for the making and breaking of saturated C-H bonds. This equates to a surface sparsely populated by chemisorbed hydrocarbon with the sites mainly occupied by highly mobile adatoms, X, in isotopic equilibrium with the gas phase, X2. The adsorbed alkyl and 1,2-diadsorbed alkene were sometimes depicted as a-bonded species involving a contiguous pair of metal atoms (Scheme 2). 2. Roll-over and spill-over of transients The exchange reactions often show structure-sensitive features which reveal that two and sometimes more types of site are involved. Thus the initial exchange of ethane on Pt [ 8 ] shows a characteristic U-shaped distribution (d,-d, isomers) which is even found using a single crystal (111 face) as catalyst [9] . A minimum of two distinct types of site is required to explain this feature which is also observed for other alkanes and cycloalkanes, e.g. cyclopentane gives maxima in the d, and d,-isomers initially on Pt [7] , as shown in Fig. 1. The latter substrate constitutes an excellent probe as many distinctive features are noted in the initial distributions for various metals. Thus pronounced maxima may be noted in the d8 and d,o isomers as well as in the d, and ds isomers [7] and occasionally in the d2 isomer, especially on Rh [ 101. Clearly the ass exchange process is confined to one face of the C5 ring such that repetitive cis elimination and addition of an X atom is confined to the initial formation of d, to ds isomers. One roll-over of diadsorbed cyclopentene is required before formation of the d8 isomer becomes possible, as shown in Scheme 3. At least two roll-overs E.J.

The fact that isolated trimethylene units in compounds such as 1,1,3,3-tetramethylcyclohexane and bicyclo [3.3.1 ] nonane gave maxima in the d5 and not in the d6 isomers in initial distributions using Pd [ 1 ] confirms that the a 13 process and roll-over is the correct 22 E.J.

Kelly et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (/994) 19-28 23 general explanation since roll-over can never allow the a /3 process to extend to replacement of one of the H atoms at the central C atom of such a unit (Scheme 4) . Perhaps it should be stated that such results obtained over the years have eclipsed Kemball's original explanation for roll-over which was based on a carbene-like or aamonoadsorbed species [7]. In the early sixties the a/3 process was presented in a novel fashion as the interconversion of o--bonded alkyl and ar-bonded alkene as ligands of the same active surface metal atom [ 12] (see Scheme 5), which was thought to be coordinatively highly unsaturated, e.g. at the corners or edges of crystals. This theory immediately relates the surface reactions to organometallic chemistry and to homogeneous catalysis. Furthermore, roll-over could then be readily envisaged as the breaking of the weak 7r-bond to the metal with release of intermediate alkene at least into the van der Waals layer. Many results supported this picture [ 1 ] . For example, the initial exchange features and exchange plus endolexo isomerism in the compounds I and II respectively required roll-over about the central C-C bond; this is most readily seen as involving formation of olefins III and IV respectively followed by detachment from the metal and readsorption at the other face. U II III Burwell and coworkers [ 11 ] have suggested the mechanisms shown in Scheme 6 for the roll-over step. The general consensus at present is that this roll-over mechanism as first proposed by Burwell [4] is essentially correct, but the detailed description of the 1,2-diadsorbed species involved, whether Q- or Ir-bonded, still remains a subject for dispute [ 1 ] . For example, Burwell's description does not extend to the key 1,2-diadsorbed species required by the results for I and II above [ 1 ] where, basically, olefinic intermediates are required to account for the observed initial two-face multiple exchange. More recently Rooney and coworkers [ 8 ] have argued that the Ir-bond theory leads naturally to a general mobility of intermediates including inter-site transfer as well as roll- IV -X M RCX- CXR' ~ RCX =~= CXR' Scheme 5. 24 E.J.

For example, the basis of dual-functional catalysis in paraffin reforming, e.g. by Pt/ SiOZ A1203, involving the reversible migration of fully-mobile transient alkenes from metal to acidic sites, is the ultimate manifestation of this general behaviour. Thus while roll-over may result in the alkene 7r-bonding again to the same metal atom of origin, it is therefore entirely reasonable to suppose that migration of alkene from one type of metal atom site to another under exchange conditions also occurs, particularly if they are contiguous as previously suggested [ 13 ] . When Pt/Ti02 is reduced at higher temperatures (773 K) [6], where a strong metal support interaction is induced, it is found to have negligible capacity for chemisorbing H=. Nevertheless, it retains much of its activity for reaction of cyclopentane with D, while yielding the characteristic multiple exchange behaviour associated with Pt [6]. Of high significance, these results show that the site densities for paraffin reactions are very low, perhaps only corner, edge and terrace atoms and that the assumption of a surface pool of excess D adatoms rapidly scrambling with H adatoms is not essential. A novel variation of the ass process which is supported by recent work both in the homogeneous and heterogeneous fields has therefore been suggested [ t4]. This requires the 7r-bonding concept together with direct reaction of adsorbed alkene with weakly held X= molecules (Scheme 7) . In this way single metal atom sites can catalyse direct scrambling of the H atoms in the paraffinic substrates with D, molecules in the gas phase. E.J. Kelly et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994)19-28 25 In all of this, two distinct general philosophical approaches can be recognised. In one of these the sites are coordinatively highly unsaturated single metal atoms, the intermediate alkene is 7T-bonded, may react directly with weakly held molecular XZ species, and is mobile on the surface at least in two-dimensions. All that is then required to explain the variety of features observed in cyclopentane exchange, etc., is to have two and perhaps three types of site with partial inter-site transfer of various deuterated cyclopentenes. These sites may be labelled M,, M2, and M3 with additional variables such as the degree of inter-site transfer M, H M2, MZ H M3, and M, H M3 influencing the exchange patterns. The alternative view is that the 1,2-diadsorbed intermediates are essentially o- bonded, basically immobile, and only capable of reacting with X adatoms. Now the required variables are thought to arise from the possible contiguous metal atom pairs M,M,, M,MZ, M,M3, MZM3, M2MZ and M3M3, which provide two ass o--bonds (Scheme 2) [ 10]. The contrast between these opposed views has been sharply focussed by two recent publications. In one of these [ 8 ] the original theoretical explanation [ 5 ] of the U-shaped initial distribution for ethane exchange on Pt has been re-examined in the light of the '7rbond theory and surface mobility of transient alkenes. Kemball [ 7 ] realized that two distinct types of sites are required and assumed the simplest model where these act independently, as if they were on separate catalysts simply mechanically mixed. This mechanism can be summarized as in Scheme 8. The two types of site are labelled A and B with A sites generating a limited ass process (falling initial distribution) and B sites affording an extensive ass process (rising initial distribution). Two arbitrary parameters, one for each of these two processes respectively, together with a third for their relative proportions, can then be used to calculate the U-shape initial distribution observed [7] . However, Scheme 8 is merely one limiting form of a more general mechanism (Scheme 9) where reversible inter-site transfer or spill-over of all CZ species is also possible. It is virtually impossible to calculate theoretical distributions according to Scheme 9, because the statistical analysis is far too complex. Therefore Hegarty and Rooney [8] set out to show that another limiting form of Scheme 9 with dissociative chemisorption of C2X6 on A sites only, but with substantial reversible spill-over of CZXS and/or CZX4 species, is theoretically valid. This is shown in Schemes l0a and lob for spill-over of CZX4 and CZXS species, respectively. Now the arbitrary parameters are the same two for the ass processes as before, and the E CZX6 E CZX5A E C2XSB 11 ?1 E CZX4A E CZX4B Scheme 8. 26 E.J.

Scheme 10 is kinetically just as valid theoretically as Scheme 8 and is statistically just as good in reproducing the U-shaped distributions [ 8] . We wish to stress this point because our original paper [ 8] has apparently caused some confusion and has been queried on kinetic grounds [ 10]. The statistical analyses are based solely on Schemes l0a and lob, but our ultimate aim was to show that if these are kinetically and statistically valid the most realistic mechanism is as in Scheme 9, but with limited activation on B sites, and also limited reversible spill-over from A to B sites. 3. Spill-over and cyclopentane/DZ exchange The concept of inter-site transfer can also explain several other features of exchange reactions. Thus in the initial distributions from cyclopentane and various alkanes a maximum is often observed [ 10] in the d2 isomers in addition to maxima in the perdeuteroisomers and others. This is found particularly with Rh catalysts [ 15] but is also sometimes noted using Pd and Pt [4] . It has been shown using deuterium NMR that 1,2-dideuterocyclopentane is responsible [ 16] and not the 1,1-d, isomer as first thought. The maximum in d, is E.J. Kelly et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 19-28 27 readily explained if two types of Site A and B, as in the above schemes for ethane, are operating with an extensive ass process on B and a very limited one on A. This would normally give a U-shaped distribution with a minimum between the d, and ds deuterocyclopentanes. However, if substantial do-cyclopentene, which is the first and most abundant 7r-bonded cyclopentene formed by initial chemisorption on the B sites, is released and then migrates onto the A sites and exchanges there, the resultant deuterocyclopentanes will have a falling distribution starting from the d, isomer. Thus, three distributions can be seen to arise from distinctly different paths; one, a falling distribution starting from the d, isomer due to direct chemisorption and reaction on A sites; two, a falling distribution starting from the d2 isomer due to inter-site transfer from B sites of cyclopentenes, especially do-cyclopentene, with further reaction on A sites; and three, a distribution rising to a d5 maximum from repeated exchange on B sites without desorption or inter-site transfer. A suitable combination of these distributions can produce an overall distribution with maxima in the d2 and d5 isomers [ 17 ] . The only alternative possible explanation which seems unlikely is that the dz maximum arises from involvement of some B sites where the ass process does not propagate readily from the initial 1,2-C atoms of attachment because of restricted movement of adsorbed cyclopentyl. Kemball and coworkers [ 15,16] have commented on the fact that the d6 isomer is more abundant than the d7 isomer using Pt catalysts for cyclopentane exchange whereas the reverse holds for Pd catalysts. They attribute this feature to the intervention of an aadiadsorbed species on Pt, a species which is ruled out for Pd by the observation that an isolated trimethylene unit only exchanges initially 5 and not 6 of its H atoms on the latter metal [ 1 ] . The db feature can now be explained without the intervention of an aa-bonded species on Pt. If d3-cyclopentene is formed in abundance initially on B sites and then migrates to A sites it can readsorb in two modes X and Y. H D H H D ~H D D ~ ~D H ~ 'H H H H H NlA 'N1A X The X mode can only lead to d5-cyclopentane but the Y mode gives a falling distribution starting from the ds isomer, thereby mirroring the falling distribution, d, > d2 > d3, which is normally observed due to direct chemisorption and reaction on A sites. On the other hand the ass process is extensive on all Pd sites so even if there is mobility of cyclopentenes on this metal the d6 isomer will now be less abundant than the d7 isomer. In conclusion there is ample evidence that inter-site mobility of transient alkenes may occur even at ambient temperatures in paraffin reactions on several metal catalysts. Furthermore, the rate of the a/3 process, the multiplicity of exchange generated, and the ease of mobility at each of these single atom sites for a given metal will also depend on electron 28 E.J. Kelly et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalvsis 89 (1994) 19-28 density. The latter is an intrinsic variable subject to dispersion effects, alloying, support effects, and doping with electron donors and acceptors. These factors complicate more detailed interpretation of exchange patterns such as those for cyclopentane, and will be discussed at length elsewhere [ 18 ] . A further consideration which has been omitted from the foregoing discussion in order to avoid confusion but which has been amply dealt with in earlier papers [I], is the possibility that 7r-bonded alkene may interconvert with 7- and 0--bonded allylic species. These in turn may interconvert with dienes and then dienyls, depending on substrate chainlength. In the early description of the 7r-bond theory [ 1 ] , it was suggested that adsorbed cyclic species presented only one face to the metal without turnover but that for 7r-allylic species, but not 7r-alkene, D atom addition could occur with both trans and cis orientations, i.e. topside to the ring as well as bottomside. We now prefer the alternative proposal that D atom addition is always cis and that certain intermediate hydrocarbon species roll-over on the surface [4] . However, this in no way rules out the possibility that the inter-conversion of 7r-bonded alkene and allylic species may be a very significant process on metals such as Pd which gives very extensive multiple exchange of cyclopentane, etc. [ 1 ] . After all, cyclohexene readily forms benzene in the presence of H= under mild conditions on Pd catalysts which shows that all the intermediate species, cyclohexenyl to cyclohexadienyl, without any specially favourable energetic features, must be present on this metal surface. Indeed, extensive formation of 7r-allylic species from 7r-bonded alkene precursors in general may provide a very efficient way of generating transient free alkene. Interconversions of Irallylic intermediates with their o--bonded analogues should be rapid and addition of an H or D atom to the latter immediately affords free alkene. 4. References [ 1 ] J.K.A.

        "dc:description": "The mechanisms of exchange reactions of paraffins with deuterium on transition metal catalysts are briefly reviewed with an emphasis on those of ethane and cyclopentane on platinum. Convincing arguments are presented to show that the reactive sites are individual coordinatively highly unsaturated metal atoms such as those at corners, edges and on terraces, and thus relatively few in numbers. A key intermediate for multiple exchange formed on those sites is π-bonded alkene which exhibits a considerable degree of mobility including roll-over and inter-site transfer subsequent to the rupture of the weak metal-olefin π-bond. Mobility of transients is therefore a complicating factor which helps to explain the variety of features noted in initial deuteroisomer distributions, without requiring more than two or three fundamentally distinct types of single atom sites. An additional variable governing the relative rates of the various steps, including interconversion of σ-bonded alkyl and π-bonded olefin, is the electron density at each type of site. This can be varied for a given metal by dispersion, support effects, alloying and dopants.",
