We report fabrication of non-precious Fe2O3-CeO2/C electrocatalyst (EC) with rich interfacial structure for oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline electrolyte. Taking the advantage of its unique redox property it shows an appreciable positive onset potential (0.81 V vs. RHE), half-wave potential (0.57 V), smaller Tafel slope (68 mV dec−1) as compared to Fe2O3/C and higher limiting current density (− 6.05 mA cm−2) compared to that of 20 wt% Pt/C. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable stability with 87.5% current retention during the chronoamperometric test, establishing it as a promising EC.

An efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the cathode surface is crucially significant for the new generation energy storage and conversion devices. As the sluggish kinetics at the cathode surface perpetually hinder the efficiency of ORR; a suitable electrocatalytic surface is intensely needed to achieve the desired activity [5]. Electrocatalysts (ECs) are the key component of major renewable-energy technologies such as fuel cells, metal-air batteries, and water splitting. Pt-based materials are the most active ECs for ORR due to their intrinsic catalytic properties [6,7]. Nevertheless, the high cost and lack of stability in both acidic and alkaline media still restrict Pt-based ECs for effective commercialization. Transition metal oxide/carbon (TMO/C) composites have been extensively investigated in recent times because of its low cost, easy availability, and high activity toward ORR [8–10]. The high electrical conductivity of C facilitates electron transfer and enhances the electrocatalytic activity for the ORR process. TMO/C (MxOy/C; M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu etc) composite enhances the surface electrical conductivity rendering abundant catalytically active sites. CeO2 modified TMO/C materials possess characteristic properties exhibiting more efficient ORR because of the unique redox properties of CeO2 [2,7,8]. Cerium in CeO2 exists in Ce(III/IV) state because of the inherent lattice defect, availing sort of oxygen vacancies. Consequently, CeO2 acts as an oxygen buffer and enhances the rate of O2 adsorption/desorption during the ORR process [8,11–14]. Herein, we report fabrication of Fe2O3-CeO2/C nanocomposite with rich interface structure as an efficient EC for ORR in alkaline electrolyte. The as-prepared Fe2O3-CeO2/C exhibited superior ORR activity with excellent stability due to the enchantment of its unique intrinsic activity triggered by the synergistic action. This new composite material makes the best use of its intrinsic characteristics, resulting in a potential candidate for the next generation cathode ECs. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of electrocatalysts The Fe2O3-CeO2 was synthesized using a solvothermal method followed by calcination. Briefly, NaOH (1.6 g, 1 M, 40 mL) was added to a solution containing FeCl3·6H2O (0.54 g, 0.05 M) and (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 (1.1 g, 0.05 M) prepared in 40 mL 1:1 water/ethanol solution. After 30 min of constant stirring, the reaction mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and kept at 120 °C for 6 h followed by centrifugation and washing. Finally, the Fe2O3-CeO2 was obtained by calcination of the precursor at 450 °C for 4 h. The ECs are prepared by amalgamating carbon (Vulcan carbon XC-72R) and as-synthesized MO (3:7 wt. ratio) using agate mortar grinder followed by ultrasonication in ethanol. Finally, the products were dried properly and used for further characterization and electrocatalytic activities. To study the effect of CeO2 loading in Fe2O3-CeO2/C for ORR we prepared Fe2O3/C, Fe2O3-CeO2/C-37, Fe2O3-CeO2/C-73 and CeO2/C via altering the molar ratio of the precursor salts; FeCl3·6H2O and (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6, keeping the same synthesis approach. The molar concentration of the precursor salt FeCl3·6H2O and (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 were changed as 3:7 and 7:3, respectively for the synthesis of Fe2O3-CeO2/C-37 and Fe2O3-CeO2/C-73. 2.2 Characterization The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on the Bruker Axs (Germany), instrument with nickel-filtered Cu Kα (0.15418 nm) radiation at 30 mA and 40 kV. Raman spectra were collected by Renishaw RM1000 confocal microprobe at an excitation wavelength of 514 nm (Ar+ ion laser). The morphologies of the as-prepared ECs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL). The surface properties of samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on Thermo ESCALAB 250XI with Al Kα. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves were obtained on a thermal analyzer (Model TGA-50, Shimadzu) instrument. 2.3 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical experiments were performed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell workstation (Autolab PGSTAT 204, Metrohm equipped with Pt wire, freshly polished glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 3 mm diameter) and Ag/AgCl as the counter, working and reference electrodes respectively) system at room temperature (25°C). The EC ink was prepared by dispersing 5 mg catalyst into a typical solution of H2O (0.2 mL)-C2H5OH (0.3 mL)- 0.5 wt% Nafion (0.5 mL) followed by sonication for 30 min. 6 μL of the suspension was dropped on to GCE (MO loading content ∼ 0.13 mg cm−2) and dried at 35 °C for 12 h in N2 atmosphere. Standard 20 wt% Pt/C was also deposited using the same method with 2 μL of Pt/C suspension. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in N2 and O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were measured at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 in O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. The chronoamperometry (CA) was carried at the potential of −0.3 V, and at 1600 rpm in O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH solution for 6 h. Electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the ECs were calculated from the double-layer capacitance (CDL) obtained from the CVs measured in N2 saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at different scan rates. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural and morphological characterization PXRD patterns of the ECs display the structural changes, crystallinity, and phase purity in Fe2O3-CeO2/C (Fig. 1a). The broad and low-intensity carbon (graphitic C-sp2 structure) [15] peak at about 24ο (2θ) vanishes in Fe2O3/C, Fe2O3-CeO2/C and CeO2/C because of the lower crystallinity of C. Fe2O3/C and CeO2/C show the diffraction pattern of pure Fe2O3 (JCPDS No. 89–8104) and CeO2 (JCPDS No. 81–0792) respectively, while Fe2O3-CeO2/C shows discrete diffraction peaks of the both Fe2O3 and CeO2 phases establishing extensive MO-MO interfaces. In addition, the peak intensity of the parent C, Fe2O3 and CeO2 has significantly reduced in Fe2O3-CeO2/C suggesting the formation of MO-MO/C interfaces. The HR-TEM analysis (Fig. 1b) further illustrates the overlapping regions of Fe2O3-CeO2 over the C-matrix. The lattice spacing of about 0.27, 0.33 and 0.31 nm represent the typical Fe2O3 (104), C (002) and CeO2 (111) crystal planes respectively [16–18]. The low-resolution TEM images investigated for Fe2O3-CeO2/C (Fig. S1a-c) further reveal the homogeneous dispersion of Fe2O3 and CeO2 over the C-matrix establishing massive interfaces randomly allocated at the microscopic dimension. The average particle size was observed to be ~22 nm (Fig. S1d). SAED pattern analyzed for Fe2O3-CeO2/C showed a set of diffraction rings due to the crystalline reflections of (111)-CeO2, (104)-Fe2O3, (220)-CeO2, (300)-Fe2O3 and (311)-CeO2, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1b which is well consistent with the XRD patterns. The clear diffraction rings and the few additional bright spots nearby the diffraction rings suggest the polycrystalline and partial single crystalline nature of the investigated catalyst. Raman spectroscopy analysis shows the effect of CeO2 in Fe2O3/C as shown in Fig. S2. A sharp Raman peak at ~454 cm−1 is observed for CeO2 which is attributed to the symmetric F2g mode for fcc CeO2 due to the symmetric O–Ce–O stretching over the surrounding oxygen atoms. However, the significant reduction of peak intensity and broadening of the F2g peak in the Fe2O3-CeO2/C infers the creation of more oxygen vacancy as the F2g mode is highly labile to the disorder in the vicinity of oxygen sub-lattice [19]. Fe2O3/C exhibits two typical bands at 212 and 274 cm−1, which are the characteristics Fe–O–Fe stretching of A1g and Eg mode respectively. The atomic percentage (At.%) in Fe2O3-CeO2/C were accomplished by EDX (Fig. S2 b). The At.% of Fe, Ce, O and C in Fe2O3-CeO2/C were 1, 1, 2 and 96% respectively. The percentage compositions of the associated ECs are summarized in Table S1. The BET surface area of Fe2O3-CeO2/C (147.6 m2 g−1) is higher than Fe2O3/C (119.4 m2 g−1) and CeO2/C (86.4 m2 g−1) revealing that Fe2O3-CeO2/C interfacial EC accommodates more active sites for the effective ORR (Fig. 2 ). The evaluated average pore diameter is 3.6, 3.5 and 2.7 nm (insets of Fig. 2a-c) respectively for Fe2O3/C, Fe2O3-CeO2/C and CeO2/C, which specifies the mesoporous nature of the ECs. TGA analysis was carried out to study the MO content of the as-prepared ECs as presented in Fig. S3. The TGA curves show ~70% weight loss at the temperature range of 550–600 °C which is due to the chemical dehydration, removal of counter ions and C oxidation. The remaining wt% of ~30% are the MO content of the ECs. The surface structures and the valence states of the ECs were further investigated by XPS analysis. The survey spectrum of Fe2O3-CeO2/C reveals that Fe, Ce, O and C are the constituent elements of the EC (Fig. S4a). The Fe 2p spectrum consists of two photoelectron peaks at BE of 711 eV for Fe 2p3/2 and 724.4 eV for 2p1/2 with ∆ BE = 13.4 eV and two intense broad satellite peaks (sat. 1 and sat. 2) originating from rapid change in Coulombic potential when the photoelectron passes through the valence band (Fig. 3a) [20]. The XPS spectrum of Ce 3d shows two sets of peaks, which can be assigned to 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 as shown in Fig. 3b. The peaks at 889 and 898.6 eV in the XPS spectrum are assigned to Ce3+ while the peaks at 882.6, 901.2, 907.5 and 916 eV are assigned to Ce4+ state of cerium [21,22]. The Ce3+ content in CeO2 is a typical descriptor of oxygen vacancy which determines the feasibility and enhancement of the Ce4+ ↔ Ce3+ redox transition. The Ce 3d XPS result clearly depicts that the Fe2O3-CeO2/C is integrated with rich oxygen vacancies which is significant for efficient electrocatalytic ORR. The O 1 s XPS spectrum as shown in Fig. S4b exhibit two distinct peaks for lattice oxygen (Fe-O, 529 eV), and surface adsorbed oxygen (532.6 eV) [23]. The deconvolution peaks of C 1 s spectrum display three peaks that could be assigned to sp3-C and graphitic sp2-C (Fig. S4c). 3.2 Electrocatalytic activities Fig. 4a shows the CV curves of the investigated ECs. The significant reduction peaks observed in the CVs under O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH solution suggest that the ECs are active toward ORR. The ORR onset potential exhibited by C, Fe2O3/C and CeO2/C are 0.75, 0.78 and 0.76 V (vs. RHE) respectively while for Fe2O3-CeO2/C, it is observed to be 0.81 V, suggesting a significant overpotential drop for Fe2O3-CeO2/C catalysed ORR process. Furthermore, it should be noted that in comparison to C, CeO2/C and Fe2O3/C, CeO2 modified Fe2O3/C exhibits different in action toward electrocatalytic activity, CV loop, onset potential as well as peak potential. The ORR kinetics is further investigated by RDE measurements. Fig. S5 displays the rotation controlled LSV polarization curves measured in O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. The trends in the ORR activity of the ECs are consistent with the results of the CV study. Fig. 4b presents the LSV curves portraying the current densities and onset potentials for the investigated ECs at 1600 rpm. It is noteworthy that the weak electrocatalytic ORR performances exhibited by C have significantly enhanced on the introduction of Fe2O3 in terms of onset potential and current density. While Fe2O3-CeO2/C shows more positive onset potential (0.81 V) and half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.57 V) which is significantly higher than that of C, Fe2O3/C and CeO2/C signifying a promotional effect after the CeO2 modification. The limiting current density of Fe2O3-CeO2/C at 1600 rpm is – 6.05 mA cm−2 which is higher than that of CeO2/C (−4.14 mA cm−2), Fe2O3/C (−3.8 mA cm−2), C (−1.9 mA cm−2) and commercial Pt/C (−5.2 mA cm−2). Notably, the ECSA of Fe2O3-CeO2/C (20 m2 g−1) is lower than CeO2/C (35.9 m2 g−1) as calculated from the CV derived CDL method (Fig. S6). However, Fe2O3-CeO2/C exhibits higher ECSA than Fe2O3/C (15 m2 g−1) indicating the presence of more active sites which might be playing a significant role in the enhanced ORR process. The number of electrons (n) transferred during an elementary ORR process is calculated based on Koutecky−Levich (K-L) equation [24]. K-L plots of the investigated ECs at 0.50 V is shown in Fig. S7 which show the ‘n’ values for Fe2O3/C, Fe2O3-CeO2/C, Pt/C and C are 1.9, 4, 2.4, 4 and 2.8 respectively. Both the Fe2O3-CeO2/C and Pt/C exhibit 4e ORR process without forming H2O2 as an intermediate product. The linearity and parallel fitting lines of the K-L plots suggest first-order kinetics of the ORR catalysis. The 4e pathway is evaluated for the ECs over a wide potential range as shown in Fig. S8a. Mass activity (MA) at 1600 rpm over the potential range of 0.40–0.55 V regions shows the ORR activity order of Fe2O3-CeO2/C > CeO2/C > Fe2O3/C for the set of investigated ECs (Fig. S8b) which describes the typical intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of the ECs. The optimized Fe2O3 loading in the mixed catalyst is significant for the efficient ORR. The excessive or insufficient Fe2O3 in Fe2O3-CeO2/C may decrease the ORR performance due to the lower intrinsic catalytic activity of Fe2O3 in contrast to CeO2/C. Therefore, to study the effect of CeO2 on the ORR, we performed activity measurements of Fe2O3-CeO2/C-37 and Fe2O3-CeO2/C-73. Fig. S10 (a-d) show the ORR activities (LSV polarization curves, MA, and ‘n’ values) exhibited by Fe2O3-CeO2/C-37 and Fe2O3-CeO2/C-73. The ORR performances are significantly reduced for both the ECs in comparison to the Fe2O3-CeO2/C. Thus, the comprehensive evaluation suggests that an equimolar Fe2O3-CeO2 ratio is essentially significant for sustaining the synergy that can enhance the ORR process which is exclusively satisfied by Fe2O3-CeO2/C. The Tafel slope of Fe2O3/C, Fe2O3-CeO2/C and CeO2/C are 74, 68 and 63 mV/dec respectively while in the high overpotential region it is 776, 466 and 781 mV/dec respectively (Fig. 4c). The lower Tafel slope of Fe2O3-CeO2/C over a wide potential range is significant for the superior ORR. The chronoamperometric test (Fig. S9a) displays the stability of Fe2O3-CeO2/C with % degradation of current measured up to 6 h. Pt/C shows 72.5% current retention while Fe2O3-CeO2/C shows 87.5% after 6 h. The accelerated durability test (ADT) performed up to 10,000 redox cycle (Fig. S9b) reveals an outstanding current density with significantly smaller ∆j (0.04 mA cm−2) and ∆E1/2 (0.01 V) suggesting superior durability possessed by Fe2O3-CeO2/C. Table S2 shows a comparative analysis on the ORR performances with some established MO-based ECs. The ORR activity exhibited by Fe2O3-CeO2/C is superior in terms of current density and Tafel slope. It shows significant Eonset and E1/2 which are comparable with the reported ECs. The fundamental cause for the superior ORR activity of Fe2O3-CeO2/C are due to efficient charge transport and synergistic properties of the EC resulting favourable reduction of O2. Vulcan carbon has several sp2-C which provide a superior charge transfer rate. Adequate diffusion of molecular O2 into the activated surface of the EC is one of the major factors for efficient electrocatalysis. CeO2 with its characteristic redox properties unveiled rich oxygen vacancies resulting in enhanced O2 transport, storage, and release through the Fe2O3-CeO2 interfaces. Thus, when the O2 density gets lower at the high-current density, the adsorbed oxygen (O*ad) on CeO2 sites accept e− facilitating the activation of O2 and form HO2 −, followed by transfer to the proximate Fe2O3 active sites. 4 Conclusions Fe2O3-CeO2/C EC with rich oxide-oxide interfacial structure was designed. The composite material unveils a high surface area including significant oxygen vacancy that could be beneficial for ORR. Fe2O3-CeO2/C shows better kinetics with a small Tafel slope and higher MA accompanied by the highly anticipated 4e ORR process. Moreover, it offers an enhanced current density (− 6.05 mA cm−2) steered by improved stability and high durability in contrast to that of Pt/C. Benefiting from the CeO2 assisted oxygen vacancies, high BET surface area and strong oxide-oxide/C interface interactions, Fe2O3-CeO2/C enriches its synergistic mechanism toward a superior ORR, which establishes a promising method of designing highly active non-precious MO-based EC for future green energy production.
