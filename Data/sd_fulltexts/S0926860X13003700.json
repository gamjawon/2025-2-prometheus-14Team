A suitable solvent and catalyst systems were determined. Semi-batch experiments including perturbations were performed. The main branches of the reaction network could be identifi ed. For this reaction network a corresponding catalytic cycle is suggested. Applied Catalysis A: General, 462â€“463 (2013) 287 Theoretical study of selective hydrogenation in a mixture of acetylene and ethylene over Fe@W(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces Chun-Chih Chang, Chen-Hao Yeh, Jia-Jen Ho Department of Chemistry, National Taiwan Normal University, 88, Section 4, Tingchow Road, Taipei 116, Taiwan The presence of Fe atoms on W(1 1 1) surface could decrease the desorption energies of C 2 H 4 , resulting in the increase of catalyst selectivity. Fe(1,2)@W(1 1 1) surface exhibits a superior catalytic property for acetylene to be directly hydrogenated to ethylene, and ethylene could be desorbed directly from the surface. Replacing the traces of Fe atoms on the W(1 1 1) surface can suppress the reactivity of C C bond scission and facilitate partial hydrogena- tion of C 2 H 2 to C 2 H 4 .
