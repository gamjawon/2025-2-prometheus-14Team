Graphic Catalysts based on Pd nanoparticles supported on polyacrylic resins or on polyacrylic resins/silica composites are evaluated in terms of catalyst reusability and mechanical stability. Both technologically relevant features are satisfactory. Resin/silica/Pd composites exhibit an appreciable but not dramatic decrease of specific catalytic activity (3–4 times) when compared with their parent resin/Pd materials, but this decrease is compensated by higher mechanical stability and easier separability of the catalyst from the reaction mixture. Keywords Resin-supported Pd catalysts Catalyst reusability Mechanical stability 1 Introduction In recent years, we have been working in developing the scientific bases of interesting and promising industrial metal catalysts based on ion-exchange resins, both macroreticular and of gel-type in nature (Bayer catalysts) [1–3]. In the course of our endeavor, we have developed efficient metallation and reduction protocols as well as a procedure suitable for controlling the allocation (peripheral versus full body) of the metal nanoclusters inside the resins particles [4]. We have also addressed in quantitative terms the crucial question of nanomorphology and molecular accessibility of the polymer framework [5,6] and we could conclude that lightly cross-linked (2–6mol%) resins offer only a moderate resistance to mass transfer of reagents and products. Finally, we have also addressed the issue of chemical stability of the polymer framework under hydrogenation conditions (20–40°C and 1–5atm of dihydrogen) for reasonably long lasting operational times [7]. In the frame of our most recent work, we have also discovered that our gel-type resins [8] with cross-linking degree from 2 to 6mol%, act as template structures in controlling the growth of palladium nanoparticles generated in their interior that turn out to exhibit a diameter always very near to 3nm. Quite remarkably the same size appears to feature palladium nanoclusters generated at the “walls” of the macropores of a commercial macroreticular resin that we investigated for purposes not related to this apparent size-control effect [9]. We report here on a further step of our endeavor, i.e. an attempt to increase the mechanical stability of our catalysts upon re-inforcing our organic frameworks with a silica skeleton [10]. 2 Results and discussion The employed catalysts SPIM-Na+/Pd0, MPIF-Na+/Pd0, MPIF-Na+/Pd0/SiO2 and SPIM-Na+/Pd0/SiO2 were prepared according to [7,10,11]. Catalytic experiments were carried out with a pressostatic reactor described in [12]. All evaluated catalysts are dimethylacrylamide polymers cross-linked with methylenebisacrylamide (4mol%) and therefore after the reduction with sodium borohydride they rest on aliphatic chains with either C(O)N(Me2), Me, C(O)O(CH2)2SO3 −Na+ or C(O)O−Na+ as pendants (Fig. 1 ) SPIM-Na+/Pd0 is a resin-supported catalyst described in [7] (Pd=1.73%) and MPIF-Na+/Pd0 (Pd=2.54%) is an analogous material described in [11]. SPIM-Na+/Pd0/SiO2 (Pd=0.9%) (10) and MPIF-Na+/Pd0/SiO2 (Pd=1.21%) [10] are very peculiar organic/inorganic composite formed by the entanglement of the polymer framework of MPIF-Na+/Pd0 or of SPIM-Na+/Pd0 and that of amorphous silica. They exhibit quite similar overall physico-chemical features. The organic/inorganic composites exhibit a nicely homogeneous distribution of silicon (XRMA) (resolution power is ca. 5μm). For MPIF-Na+/Pd0/SiO2 see [10] and for SPIM-Na+/Pd0/SiO2 see Fig. 2 . XRMA reveals us that the entanglement of the organic and inorganic frameworks is extended to the entire body of the host matrix at least at the micrometer level. Hydrogenation of cyclohexene catalyzed by SPIM-Na+/Pd0, MPIF-Na+/Pd0, SPIM-Na+/Pd0/SiO2, MPIF-Na+/Pd0/SiO2. Three consecutive runs for each tested catalyst were carried out to control catalyst stability. Catalyst are recycled upon careful decantation under dihydrogen of the solution obtained at the end of each test. The operation turns out to be amazingly facile for the SiO2-loaded catalysts, apparently thanks to the higher density of these materials. Data are collected in Figs. 3 and 4 . The independent variable is normalized upon multiplying the given time by the mass of the catalyst. This normalization comes out from the assumption that external mass transport is not rate limiting, i.e. that the rate of hydrogenation is linearly proportional to the mass of the catalyst itself. SPIM-Na+/Pd0 and MPIF-Na+/Pd0 exhibit almost identical normalized activity under seemingly diffusion-control and their reusability is perfect (Figs. 3 and 4; Table 1 ). Both catalysts SPIM-Na+/Pd0/SiO2 and MPIF-Na+/Pd0/SiO2 exhibit a peculiar and rather similar reaction profile. In both the cases, the first runs display a sluggish activity that turns to a much larger one already with the first recycling. In addition, second and third runs turn out to be almost superimposable. After this quite positive evaluation of chemical stability, we addressed the technologically important question of catalyst particles stability under operational conditions. The results are illustrated for the MPIF-Na+/Pd0/SiO2 catalyst (Figs. 5 and 6 ). The data are amazing. Both MPIF-Na+/Pd0 and SPIM-Na+/Pd0/SiO2, MPIF-Na+/Pd0/SiO2 catalysts result to be perfectly stable after three catalytic runs. These results are in fact very important in the light of technological prospects offered by resin-based metal catalysts [13]. Although the duration of the “mechanical” might be judged relatively short, the kinetic energy transferred to catalyst particles by the very vigorous agitation is estimated to be considerable enough to permit positive conclusions, in terms of catalysts mechanical stability. 3 Experimental Solvents and chemicals were of reagent grade. Catalysts were prepared according to the following references: SPIM-Na+/Pd0 [7]; MPIF-Na+/Pd0 [11]; SPIM-Na+/Pd0/SiO2 and MPIF-Na+/Pd0/SiO2 [10]. Apparatus: SEM and XRMA, Cambridge Stereoscan 250 EDX PW9800; image analysis was carried out with a Image Pro Plus Program. Catalytic experiments were carried out with a pressostatic reactor described in [12].

Both technologically relevant features are satisfactory. Resin/silica/Pd composites exhibit an appreciable but not dramatic decrease of specific catalytic activity (3–4 times) when compared with their parent resin/Pd materials, but this decrease is compensated by higher mechanical stability and easier separability of the catalyst from the reaction mixture.",
