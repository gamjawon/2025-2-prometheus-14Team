The chemistry of methanol conversion over acid zeolftes, and factors influencing catalyst performance in methanol continue to be studied. The stability and activity of non-traditional zeolftes (gallosilicates, aluminophosphates, gallophosphates) are also being investigated. There is an on-going interest in the preparation of highly dispersed metal clusters in microporous supports. Two new areas are studies of metal exchanged zeolites for NOx removal (in collaboration with Dr. Edward Curry-Hyde in the Department of Chemical Engineering), and a collaborative project with BHP's Melbourne Research Laboratory on improved zeolite adsorbents for gas separation, particularly for possible off-shore syngas production. These two groups in the Chemistry Department currently contain two postdoctoral fellows and ten research students. RUSSELL HOWE Catalyst Research at Lower Hutt Industrial Research Ltd. (P.O. Box 31310, Lower Hutt, New Zealand) has a small catalyst research group. Originally work there concentrated on catalysts related tothe gas-to-gasoline process. While testing and some research into ZSM-5 catalysts is still carried out, mainly for commercial clients (Linda Parker), the main effort is currently devoted to the preparation of noble-metal-exchanged zeolites for the removal of volatile hydrocarbons from atmospheres at low temperatures (less than 120). In particular, the work examines the removal of ethylene from fruit storage areas and the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOC's). Involved in applied catalysis A: general this work are Linda Parker and John Patterson. Equipment available includes mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, X-ray, SEM, solid state NMR, FT-IR and a range of thermal analysis techniques. The research group have developed portable mass spectrometers for on-site work. One mass spectrometer can operate for a full day on batteries. Catalyst testing rigs range from micro to pilot scale. On-line mass spectrometry and gas chromatography is automated and usually runs unattended A limited amount of methane coupling work using chlorine-promoted LiMn204 spinels has been carried out with G.R. Burns at Victoria University of Wellington. A C3 selective material may have been found. Work is soon to start on catalysts for preparative organic chemistry. J.E. PATTERSON Methanol Research Plant Proceeds BHP Petroleum has commenced construction of a $70 million Methanol Research Plant at Laverton North, in the western suburbs of Melbourne. This plant will demonstrate new technology for the production of methanol from natural gas, and is scheduled to be in production by the second half of 1994. The commencement of the plant is another step in BHP Petroleum's strategy for the development of uncommitted natural gas resources. BHPP has invested over Aus. $12 million since 1980 in research programs at BHP Research on technology for conversion of natural gas to transportable liquids, and in developing strategies for bringing gas conversion to commercial reality.
