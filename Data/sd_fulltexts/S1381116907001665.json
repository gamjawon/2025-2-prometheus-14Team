Fax: +86 22 27402604. Graphical abstract The preparation conditions have significant effect on the properties and activity of Pd-B/γ-Al2O3 amorphous catalyst. The amorphous catalyst is thermally stable at temperature below 150°C and shows stronger H2-adsorption capacity than crystallized metals with comparative surface. It exhibits high activity for the hydrogenation of tricyclopentadiene (TCPD) and a linear relationship is observed between the activity and amount of H2-adsorption. Pd-B/γ-Al2O3 amorphous catalysts were prepared through impregnation and KBH4 reduction for the hydrogenation of tricyclopentadiene. The effects of reduction conditions, pre-calcination and thermal annealing on the hydrogenation activity were studied. It is found that the reduction should be conducted in ice water batch with KBH4 solution added by dropping to avoid the crystallization of amorphous metals. Pre-calcination of the catalyst before reduction can increase the amount of Pd on the prepared catalyst. With pre-calcination at 200°C, the highest hydrogenation turnover frequency is obtained. The amorphous catalyst is thermally stable at temperature below 150°C. When annealed at higher temperature, the amorphous metals are gradually crystallized and the particle size is increased. After annealing at 600°C, the catalyst is uniformly crystallized. It is noticed that the size of amorphous Pd calculated from H2-adsorption is much smaller than the actual size observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM). This indicates that amorphous metal has stronger H2-adsorption ability than crystal metals with comparative particle sizes. The hydrogenation activity decreases with the increase of annealing temperature. Moreover, the hydrogenation activity is solely dependent on the amount of H2-adsorption, suggesting that the excellent performance of amorphous catalyst should be attributed to their better H2-adsorption ability. Keywords Pd-B/γ-Al2O3 Amorphous catalyst Tricyclopentadiene Hydrogenation Tetrahydrotricyclopentadiene 1 Introduction High energy density fuel with high density and volumetric energy content (or heating value) can provide more propulsive energy than traditional aviation fuels obtained from refinery [1–5]. Since it can significantly promote the flight distance and loading of aircrafts, the synthesis of high energy density fuel has attracted increasing interests. Generally, these fuels are liquid hydrocarbons with three to five rings. Tetrahydrotricyclopentadiene (THTCPD, tetracyclo [9.2.1.13,9.04,8] pentadecane) has been regarded as a potential high energy fuel because of its high density and low viscosity [1–4]. THTCPD is prepared through the hydrogenation of tricyclopentadiene (TCPD, trimer of cyclopentadiene). TCPD has two unsaturated bonds, with one in the norbornene ring and the other in the cyclopentene ring. They are difficult to hydrogenate due to the steric hindrance of tetracyclo-structure. Supported Pt and Pd catalysts can catalyze the hydrogenation reaction but the activity needs to be improved [1–3]. Therefore, it is necessary to explore more active catalysts. Amorphous catalysts have attracted much attention because of their superior catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of organics [6–20]. The short-range ordering structures of amorphous catalysts can provide more active and selective sites for hydrogenation reactions. The intensively studied Ni amorphous catalysts exhibit excellent activity for the hydrogenation of many liquid organics [9–16]. However, the amorphous metals are metastable and tend to become crystal particles at high reaction temperature. The presence of nonmetal elements can promote the thermal stability of amorphous metals because of an electron effect. For example, alloy catalysts with B, P, and C elements show good thermal stability [9–16]. Loading of amorphous metals on supports with large surface can also improve the stability and activity because of the interaction between metal and support [14,15]. It has also been shown that pretreatment such as calcination before chemical reduction can enhance the interaction between metal and support, leading to higher activity [16]. Although many amorphous metals have been investigated, the reports on amorphous Pd catalysts are relatively limited. An amorphous Pd-B/SiO2 catalyst for nitrobenzene hydrogenation was firstly reported [17]. Then its micro-Raman spectroscopy characterization was reported [18]. Later a Pd-B/γ-Al2O3 amorphous alloy catalyst was prepared for the hydrogenation of anthraquinone [19]. Recently, it is reported that supported noble metals including Pd reduced by glow discharge plasma show some amorphous characteristics [20]. Since Pd-based catalysts are necessary for the hydrogenation of many organics, such as the present case of tricyclopentadiene hydrogenation, Pd-based amorphous catalysts would also find many applications as Ni-based catalysts have done. Previously, we have prepared a Pd-B/γ-Al2O3 amorphous alloy catalyst that exhibits excellent thermal stability [21]. In this work, we prepared this catalyst with different reduction conditions and pre-calcination, estimated the thermal stability, and applied it for the hydrogenation of tricyclopentadiene in liquid phase. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Pd-B/γ-Al2O3 amorphous alloy catalyst was prepared by the following procedures. γ-Al2O3 powders (Tianjin Chemical Engineering Design Institute, 100–120 mesh) calcined at 550°C for 2h were impregnated with diluted PdCl2 (Xian Kaili Chemical Engineering Company) solution. The initial amount of Pd was defined as 0.4wt.% for all the experiments. After dried at 120°C for 2h, the catalysts were pre-calcined at defined temperature for another 2h. Then they were reduced by adding KBH4 solution (0.2M) under gentle stirring in an ice water bath for about 30min until no obvious bubbles were observed. The resulting black solid powders were washed thoroughly with oxygen-free distilled water until no Cl− ions were detected in the solution and subsequently with pure alcohol. Thermal annealing was carried out in N2 atmosphere at defined temperature for 2h. For X-ray diffractive (XRD) characterization, MCM-41 (Tianda Beiyang Company) was used as the support to avoid the diffraction peaks of Pd being overlapped by those of support. For the purpose of comparison, traditional 0.4wt.% Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by routine impregnation followed with H2 reduction at 300°C for 2h. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The chemical status of prepared Pd was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Perkin-Elmer PHI-1600) with Al Kα radiation (1486.6eV). The binding energy was calibrated using the C1s peak (284.6eV) of contaminant carbon. The crystal structure of prepared metals was characterized using XRD (D/MAX-2500, Cu Kα radiation). The amount of Pd supported on the catalysts was determined using inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP-OES, Vista-MPX). The metal particles were observed with transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 F-20, Philips) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) instrument. The specific surface area was measured using N2 physical adsorption (Quantachrome Nova-2000) with a multi-plot method. The H2-adsorption was conducted at 29°C with an Auto Chem 2910 analyzer (Micrimetritice). 2.3 Activity evaluation TCPD used for the hydrogenation reaction was prepared by the oligomeraiztion of cyclopentadiene and then distillation to remove the un-reacted feedstock according to previous work [4]. The purity of obtained TCPD was >96% as determined by GC. The hydrogenation reaction of TCPD was carried out in a 250mL mechanically agitated reactor containing 150mL TCPD in cyclohexane (0.16M) and 0.45g catalyst. The reactor was purged with N2 to eliminate oxygen and then filled with H2 and heated to 110°C. This low hydrogenation temperature was chosen to avoid the decomposition or oligomerization of thermally unstable TCPD. The hydrogenation reaction was started with vigorous stirring (1000rpm). The H2 pressure (1.5MPa) was maintained at constant value by continuously supplying the consumed gas. The reaction was carried out for 4h. Then the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature by flowing water. The obtained products were analyzed with HP-5971 GC–MS equipped with HP-5 capillary column (0.53mm×30m). Their concentrations were analyzed using a GC (HP 4890, FID) equipped with the same HP-5 capillary column and determined through the area normalization method. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Hydrogenated products GC–MS analysis shows that the hydrogenated products include dihydrotricyclopentadiene (DHTCPD) with the bond in norbornene ring saturated and completely saturated tetrahydrotricyclopentadiene. Fig. 1 shows that the concentration of reactant and products vary with the reaction time. The concentration of TCPD decreases quickly and a conversion of more than 95% is obtained within 10min. Correspondingly, the concentration of DHTCPD reaches a highest value during this period and begins to decline after that. The concentration of THTCPD always increases with the increase of reaction time. This tendency is a characteristic of consecutive reaction. Thus, the hydrogenation of TCPD takes place according to the following steps: The first step is easy to take place and different catalysts show similar activity. However, the second step is difficult to occur and different catalysts exhibit different activity. Therefore, the yield of THTCPD obtained from the second step is used to assess the hydrogenation activity of different catalysts. 3.2 Effect of reduction conditions The reduction conditions were studied to find an optimal reduction operation. KBH4 solution was added by slow dropping (0.5mL/min) or quick pouring, and the resulting catalyst was denoted as Cat-I and Cat-II, respectively. XPS analysis in Fig. 2 shows that the Pd spectra contain two peaks with binding energy at 335.0 and 340.1eV. These two peaks are assigned to the electron transitions of 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of Pd0, which indicates that in both cases the Pd2+ can be reduced to metallic Pd0. However, XRD characterization in Fig. 3 shows that the Pd particles reduced by two methods have different crystal structure. For Cat-I, Pd shows only a broad peak at 2θ =40° that is the characteristic of amorphous Pd [16]. Nevertheless, Cat-II has three strong peaks at 2θ =40°, 46° and 68°. These peaks are assigned to (111), (200) and (220) face of cubic crystal Pd. This suggests that some amorphous metals have become crystals. Moreover, during this reduction operation, a temperature rise of 10°C in the suspension of catalyst powders is observed. When KBH4 solution is quickly poured into the catalyst, the reduction reaction is so violent that the heat is quickly accumulated. In this case, hot spots may be formed on catalyst surface, resulting in the crystallization of amorphous Pd. The result mentioned above indicates that the reduction temperature may be an important factor influencing the crystal structure of catalyst. So a third reduction operation was conducted and the resulting catalyst was denoted as Cat-III. The reduction conditions are similar to Cat-I but a 15°C water bath was used to replace ice water bath. The XRD patterns of Cat-III are also shown in Fig. 3. It is obvious that there are three diffraction peaks at 2θ =40°, 46° and 68°, indicating the formation of Pd crystals. According to the intensity of diffraction peaks, the crystallinity of the three samples is as following: Cat-III>Cat-II>Cat-I. Therefore, the reduction temperature has to be carefully controlled in order to obtain amorphous Pd catalyst. The activity of the three catalysts was evaluated for the hydrogenation of TCPD. Since they have different crystallinity, the data may reflect the effect of crystallinity on the hydrogenation activity. The yield of THTCPD on the three catalysts is as following: Cat-I(73.5%)>Cat-II(71.2%)>Cat-III(69.9%). It is clear that amorphous Pd catalyst shows higher activity than the crystal Pd catalyst. In the following sections, all the reduction operations were conducted in ice water batch with KBH4 solution added by slow dropping. 3.3 Effect of pre-calcination In this section, the catalysts were pre-calcined at different temperature before KBH4 reduction. ICP analysis in Fig. 4 shows that this pretreatment can increase the amount of Pd on the prepared Pd-B/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. For the catalyst without pre-calcination, the amount of Pd is only 0.291wt.%, which is dramatically lower than the initial defined amount of 0.4wt.%. This means that the interaction between impregnated Pd2+ ions and support is not strong enough to anchor Pd particles on the support surface. Pre-calcinations at proper temperature can enhance the interaction between Pd2+ ions and support, and thus, stably anchor the metal particles on the support surface. The amount of Pd is increased to 0.361wt.% after pre-calcination at 300°C, but higher pre-calcination temperature does not improve the effect any more. Table 1 shows the activity of catalysts with pre-calcination at different temperature. The catalyst without pre-calcination leads to a yield of THTCPD as 60.6%, whereas those with pre-calcination exhibit a yield above 73.0%. Therefore, the pre-calcination can significantly improve the hydrogenation activity. This is reasonable because pre-calcination can increase the amount of Pd on the resulting catalyst. To evaluate the activity of per Pd atom, the turnover frequency (TOF) of Pd atoms was calculated as shown in Table 1. It is found that pre-calcination at 200°C leads to a highest TOF value, indicating that the interaction between metal and support can enhance the hydrogenation activity of amorphous Pd. Nevertheless, pre-calcination at higher temperature conversely results in lower TOF value, suggesting that too strong interaction between metal and support may suppress the hydrogenation activity. To obtain a high overall hydrogenation yield, in the following sections, all the catalysts were pre-calcined at 300°C for 2h before KBH4 reduction. 3.4 Thermal stability and effect of annealing To evaluate the thermal stability of amorphous catalysts, the catalysts were annealed at defined temperature for 2h. Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of annealed and H2-reduced catalysts. The fresh sample shows a typical amorphous characteristic with a weak and broad peak at 2θ =40°. There is no obvious change in the XRD patterns when the annealing temperature is below 150°C, indicating that the amorphous structure is thermally stable under this temperature. With the annealing temperature rising, the diffraction peak gradually grows and a new peak at 2θ =46° appears, which means the occurrence of crystallization process. When the temperature reaches 600°C, a sharp peak at 2θ =68° is observed. The diffraction peaks do not change any more at higher annealing temperature because the amorphous catalyst has been uniformly crystallized. In fact, the catalysts annealed at 600 and 800°C show very similar patterns to the traditional H2-reduced sample. To monitor the crystallization process in more detail, the in-situ annealing was characterized using XRD. The sample was heated from 50 to 600°C in N2 and the data were recorded at 50°C interval. The crystallinity at different temperature were calculated using the intensities of the (111), (200) and (220) peaks with those of H2-reduced sample as reference: Crystallinity ( % ) = [ I ( 1 1 1 ) + I ( 2 0 0 ) + I ( 2 2 0 ) ] sample [ I ( 1 1 1 ) + I ( 2 0 0 ) + I ( 2 2 0 ) ] H 2 -reduced × 100 % As shown in Fig. 6 , the crystallinity is zero at temperature below 150°C and relatively low at temperature below 200°C. It gradually rises up with the increase of annealing temperature and reaches 100% to 600°C. Therefore, it is expected that the amorphous catalyst could be used at temperature below 200°C without obvious change in amorphous structure. Fig. 7 shows the TEM images of fresh and annealed Pd-B/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. Metal particles on fresh catalyst are not obvious because they are homogeneously dispersed on the support. EDX analysis detects both Pd and B elements, confirming the existence of Pd-B alloys on the catalyst particles. The size of metal particles increases to about 5nm after annealing at 150°C, indicating the aggregation and growth of Pd particles during annealing treatment. This aggregation is more serious at higher annealing temperature. The particle size is bigger than 10nm when the annealing temperature is above 450°C but does not change much when the annealing temperature is further increased. Table 2 shows the result of physical and chemical adsorptions of fresh and annealed Pd-B/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The BET surface of fresh catalyst is 190.2m2/g, which is slightly decreased after annealing due to the aggregation in Pd particles. The amount of H2-adsorption also decreases with the increasing of annealing temperature. Since H2-chemisorption has been widely used to calculate the particle size of supported metals, the particle size of fresh and annealed catalysts was calculated in this work. The particle size of thoroughly crystallized catalysts, i.e. Pd-B/γ-Al2O3 annealed at 600°C and Pd/γ-Al2O3 reduced by H2 at 300°C, is in agreement with the results observed by TEM. However, for amorphous catalysts, the size derived from H2-adsorption is dramatically smaller than the actual size observed by TEM. This result suggests that the amorphous metals can adsorb more H2 than the crystal metals with comparative particle size (or surface area). Furthermore, this strong H2-adsorption ability of amorphous catalyst may be a reason for their excellent hydrogenation performance. The activities of fresh and annealed Pd-B/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Table 2. The yield of THTCPD is 73.5% for the fresh catalyst. It gradually decreases to 64.5% when the catalyst is annealed in the temperatures range of 150–600°C. This indicates that annealing has a negative effect on the activity of catalysts. It can be explained by the two factors. First, the crystallized metals show a lower activity than amorphous metals. Second, the growth of metal particle reduces the active sites on the metal surface. For Pd-B/γ-Al2O3 annealed at 150°C, the lower activity compared with the fresh catalyst is due to the growth of metal particles because they have similar amorphous structure. Pd-B/γ-Al2O3 annealed at 600°C shows activity similar to the H2-reduced catalyst because they have identical crystallinity and particle size. It is worthy to note that the hydrogenation activity can also be assessed in terms of H2-adsorption. Fig. 8 shows the correlation between the yield of THTCPD and the amount of H2-adsorption of six catalysts involved in Table 2. The hydrogenation activity monotonously increases with the increase in H2-adsorption, and a good linear relationship is obtained. It is evident that the hydrogenation activity is solely dependent on the H2-adsorption ability of catalysts. It also suggests that the high hydrogenation activity of amorphous Pd should be attributed to its strong H2-adsorption capacity. 4 Conclusion We have prepared Pd-B/γ-Al2O3 amorphous catalysts using impregnation followed by KBH4 reduction and applied them for the hydrogenation of TCPD to THTCPD. The reduction should be conducted in ice water batch and KBH4 solution should be added with slow dropping to avoid the crystallization of amorphous Pd. Pre-calcination before KBH4 reduction can enhance the interaction between the metal and support, increase the amount of Pd on the catalyst and improve the hydrogenation activity. The amorphous catalyst is very stable at temperature below 150°C. Annealing at higher temperature leads to the crystallization and growth of amorphous metals. Amorphous metals show stronger H2-adsorption ability and hydrogenation activity than crystal metals with comparative particle size. The hydrogenation activity of Pd catalyst is linearly dependent on the amount of H2-adsorption.
