Preparation and Characterization of Cu/SiO 2 Catalyst and Its Catalytic Activity for Hydrogenation of Diethyl Oxalate to Ethylene Glycol WANG Baowei*, ZHANG Xu, XU Qian, XU Genhui Key Laboratory for Green Chemical Technology of the Ministry of Education, School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China Abstract: The Cu/SiO 2 catalyst for gas-phase hydrogenation of diethyl oxalate (DEO) to ethylene glycol (EG) was prepared through the homogeneous deposition-precipitation method. The catalyst was evaluated at different reaction temperatures, pressures, and molar ratios of H 2 /DEO to optimize the catalyst preparation method and reaction conditions. Characterizations were carried out using various methods such as TPR, XRD, N 2 adsorption, HRTEM, and SEM to study the thermal stability of the catalyst, the catalyst forming, and the distribution of the active site. From the results of these experiments, the best preparation method, Cu loading, reduction temperature, and reaction condi- tions were obtained. Under the optimized conditions, the DEO conversion and EG yield reached 94.8% and 76.0%, respectively. Key words: copper; silica; supported catalyst; diethyl oxalate; hydrogenation; ethylene glycol Considering the decrease in petroleum resources and the increasing need of ethylene glycol (EG), which is mainly produced by oxidation of ethylene [1,2], a product of oil, it is necessary to develop new production techniques to comple- ment traditional ones. Among them, hydrogenation of oxalates, such as diethyl oxalate (DEO), is a good choice because it not only produces valuable and expensive compounds but also improves the environment by avoiding the use of petroleum and transforming CO, a poisonous gas [3,4], to valuable mate- rials. It is reasonable from both the economical and environ- mental points of view. Therefore, the study of this field be- comes increasingly important especially since there is a rise in the price of crude oil. The route of DEO hydrogenation can be expressed as fol- lows: C 2 H 5 OOCCOOC 2 H 5 + 2H 2 : HOCH 2 COOC 2 H 5 + C 2 H 5 OH (1) HOCH 2 COOC 2 H 5 + 2H 2 : HOCH 2 CH 2 OH + C 2 H 5 OH (2) HOCH 2 CH 2 OH + H 2 : C 2 H 5 OH + H 2 O (3) The hydrogenation of esters is rather difficult compared with that of aldehydes and ketones [5]. At the same time, to obtain a high amount of EG, Reaction (3) must be prevented. These goals can be achieved by the use of excellent catalysts. As a matter of fact, studies of the catalysts on this subject have been done for dozens of years, and great progress has been made [6–10]. However, the catalysts that were used in the early stage for heterogeneous hydrogenation of DEO always contained Cr, which is very harmful to the body and environ- ment and must be treated carefully [11]. Catalysts that were studied for homogeneous reactions have some disadvantages, such as high price (the active component of most of these catalysts is a precious metal, Ru), inconvenience in industry (the catalyst has to be separated after reaction, which requires a complex technique), and so on. As a result, increasing attention is paid to new heterogeneous catalysts without Cr, and among them silica-supported copper catalysts are representative [12–14]. In this study, a series of Cu/SiO 2 catalysts were pre- pared, characterized, and used for DEO hydrogenation. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation The Cu/SiO 2 catalysts with Cu loadings of 10%–50% were prepared by homogeneous deposition-precipitation of a mix- WANG Baowei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(3): 275–280 ture of an aqueous cuprammonia complex and silica sol (SW-30, Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co., Ltd., China). Ac- cording to the order of reagent addition, the methods were designated as regular (adding silica sol into aqueous cupram- monia complex), inverse (adding aqueous cuprammonia com- plex into silica sol), and co-current (adding both solutions at the same time). Each of these was tested to find the optimum one. After precipitating the solutions at room temperature, stirring was continued for 0.5 h at room temperature, and the pH value remained at about 8.0. Then, the solutions were dried in air at 120 qC for 12 h and calcined at 350 qC for 2 h. At last, the samples were activated in flowing 99% H 2 at 300–400 qC for 2 h, and pressed, crushed, and sieved to 60–80 mesh. 1.2 Catalyst characterization Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem 2910 appara- tus. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Rigaku D/MAX 2500V/PC diffractometer with Cu K . radia- tion. The working voltage and current were 40 kV and 100 mA, respectively. The specific surface area (calculated by the the BET method) was determined using a TriStar 3000 Surface Analyzer using N 2 as the adsorbate. High-resolution transmis- sion electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the samples were obtained with a Tecnai G2 F20 transmission electron microscope. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the samples were obtained with a Philips XL30ESEM scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive spec- trometer (Oxford ISIS-300, UK). 1.3 Catalyst tests The activity experiments were carried out in a tube micro- reactor (640 mm u 20 mm i.d.). DEO was vaporized, pumped into the reactor at a rate of 0.01 ml/min, and then mixed with H 2 from a H 2 tank to react. Two milliliters of the catalyst was diluted with quartz sand of the same size and volume and was placed in the middle of the reactor tube. The reactions were performed at 220–250 ºC, 0.5–4.0 MPa, and H 2 /DEO molar ratio of 170–290. The liquid products were analyzed with a Varian 3700 gas chromatograph. DEO conversion and EG yield were used to evaluate the catalyst activity. 2 Results and Discussion 2.1 Catalyst characterization results To determine the proper reduction temperature, H 2 -TPR, XRD, and SEM experiments were carried out. As shown in Fig. 1, two TPR peaks were observed. One is small at 314 °C, which is attributed to the transformation of Cu 2+ to Cu + , and the other is at 364 °C, which occurs mainly from the reduction of Cu + to Cu 0 . Because the performance of Cu-based catalysts depends on the combined effect of both Cu + and Cu 0 , which determines the conversion and selectivity, respectively [15], the reduction temperature should be selected between 314 and 364 °C. Fig. 2 shows the changes of Cu 0 and Cu + contents in the Cu/SiO 2 samples with reduction temperatures. More Cu 0 was present when reduction at 400 °C, while more Cu + was pro- duced at 300 °C, and 350 °C was the optimum reduction tem- perature. Furthermore, the dispersion of active sites was studied by SEM as shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen from Fig. 3(a) that some large grains are located on the surface of the catalyst reduced at 300 °C. Fig. 3(c) suggests that the grains agglomerated at the relatively high temperature. Only on the catalyst reduced at 350 °C in Fig. 3(b), the active sites are well distributed in a proper size. Fig. 1 H 2 -TPR profile of Cu/SiO 2 catalyst Fig. 2 XRD patterns of Cu/SiO 2 catalysts reduced at different temperatures (1) 300 °C, (2) 350 °C, (3) 400 °C WANG Baowei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(3): 275–280 Fig. 4 shows the HRTEM images of the Cu/SiO 2 catalyst obtained using different methods of reagent addition. In Fig. 4(a), bits of the catalyst prepared by the co-current method were favorably dispersed with a suitable size, whereas in Fig. 4(b) the grains were not so well distributed. Some particles were extremely large and overlapped severely. 2.2 Effect of preparation conditions on catalyst activity 2.2.1 Order of reagent addition The results of the activity experiments using the 30% Cu/SiO 2 catalyst are shown in Table 1. It is obvious that the catalyst prepared through co-current deposition showed supe- rior performance. DEO conversion reached 92.0% and EG yield was 73.8%. It is deduced that the co-current deposition method can ensure the uniformity of the catalysts because all solutions were added at a suitable rate and proportion. How- ever, for the other two catalysts, there must be one reagent (aqueous cuprammonia complex or silica sol) in excess at first, which can cause the structural difference of the Cu/SiO 2 cata- lyst and thus influence the catalytic activity. As shown in Table 2, the catalyst with 30% Cu loading pre- pared by the co-current method has a large surface area and pore volume, which were 195 m 2 /g and 0.60 cm 3 /g, respec- tively. However, the pore size (about 12.0 nm) did not change considerably.

DEO: diethyl oxalate; EG: ethylene glycol.

Reduction tem- perature also determines the ratio of Cu 0 /Cu + , which is very important to the catalytic performance of the catalyst. A very high Cu 0 /Cu + ratio will result in a low conversion because pure Cu 0 has no activity for this reaction, but a very few Cu 0 species will reduce the EG selectivity and therefore decrease the EG yield. Fig. 5 shows that the catalyst reduced at 350 °C has the highest DEO conversion (92%) and EG yield (73%), which coincide with the above analysis. All the samples were evalu- ated at 240 °C and 1 MPa with a H 2 /DEO molar ratio of 200. 2.2.3 Cu loading When Cu loading is not very high, DEO conversion rises gradually with increasing Cu loading because more active sites are exposed on the catalyst surface. However, when Cu loading reaches a certain value, particle aggregation will become more serious, and thus the catalytic activity decreases. To find the appropriate Cu loading, a series of catalysts with Cu loadings of 10%–50% were prepared and evaluated at 240 °C, 1 MPa, and the H 2 /DEO molar ratio of 200. Fig. 6 shows that 25% is the optimum Cu loading, at which the conversion and selec- tivity rise to 94.8% and 76%, respectively. 2.3 Effect of reaction conditions on catalyst activity 2.3.1 Reaction temperature The Cu/SiO 2 catalyst prepared by the co-current method was tested under different reaction conditions. It can be seen from Fig. 7 that in the whole range of temperature studied, the DEO conversion increased as the temperature increased. However, there was a maximum yield of EG at 240 °C, which can be considered as the optimum reaction temperature. High reaction temperature is advantageous for complete reaction, but it also promotes the further hydrogenation of EG to ethanol (Reaction (3)). Therefore, a moderate reaction temperature is required to produce more EG and avoid its consumption.

WANG Baowei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(3): 275–280 2.3.2 Reaction pressure Theoretically, high pressure is favorable for Reactions (1) and (2). The experimental results (Fig. 8) show that the con- version and yield increased rapidly as pressure increased. However, at pressures higher than 1 MPa, the DEO conversion declined little, whereas the EG yield increased slightly. Taking the cost of operation into account, 1 MPa was selected as the optimum reaction pressure. 2.3.3 H 2 /DEO molar ratio In theory, only 4 mol H 2 is required to produce 1 mol EG. However, in most of studies in this field, the molar ratio of H 2 /DEO above 50 is used in order to gain a high DEO con- version, but this is not the best value to obtain a high EG yield. The effect of the H 2 /DEO ratio is shown in Fig. 9. At first, the DEO conversion and EG yield were enhanced obviously with increasing H 2 /DEO ratio, and they reached a plateau between 200 and 260 H 2 /DEO ratios. At last, there was a drop in activity probably because too much H 2 diluted DEO and reduced the partial pressure of DEO, which affected the adsorption of DEO on the active sites. 3 Conclusions The co-current method is the best way of the solution addi- tion for the preparation of Cu/SiO 2 catalysts by homogeneous deposition-precipitation of a mixture of an aqueous cupram- monia complex and silica sol. The catalysts obtained have uniform active site dispersion. The proper ratio of Cu + /Cu 0 can be obtained when the precursor was activated at 350 °C. The optimal Cu loading was 25%, and the appropriate reaction conditions were 240 °C, 1 MPa, and H 2 /DEO molar ratio = 200. References [1] Li Y C, Yan S R, Yang W M, Xie Z K, Chen Q L, Yue B, He H Y.
