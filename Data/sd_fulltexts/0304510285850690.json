P. ROYER , WEN-SHIUNG CHOW and KIMI S. HATTON Department of Biochemistry, Ohio State University, 484 W. 12th Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210 (U.S.A.) (Received May 16,1984; accepted October 6,1984) Summary We report the preparation and evaluation of palladium catalysts made from polyethylenimine (PEI)/silica composites. PEI was adsorbed to either porous silica beads or silica gel. Following crosslinking, the material was leached with base to increase the surface area and availability of the polymer. The PEI/silicas rapidly chelate Pd^ from solution. Reduction of the chelated metal ions can be accomplished with sodium borohydride. Pd/PEI/silica beads are used effectively in suspension with formic acid as the hydrogen donor; deprotection of Cbz Glycine 0 t-butyl (where Cbz=carbobenzoxy) is very rapid with this catalyst compared to palladium on carbon. The Pd/ PEI/silica gel catalyst can be used effectively with hydrogen gas for the reduction of nitro benzene in methanol. Both catalysts are conveniently separated from product by simply decanting the supernatant solution. The catalysts (1% Pd) have shown no pyrophoric behavior and they are reusable. Hydrophobie derivatives of the catalysts were prepared with the hope that apolar reactants would be attracted to the metal sites with a concomi- tant enhancement of rate. The introduction of apolar groups into the cata- lyst matrix did not, however, result in a more effective catalyst compared to the catalyst made from the unmodified material. Introduction Polyethylenimine (PEI) is a branched polymer obtained by the poly- merization of aziridine: (CH^CH^NHA * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed at: AEBOCO Research Center, P.O. Box 400, Napemlle, IL 60566, U.S.A. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands The branching may be represented as follows : The amine distribution is 25% primary, 50% secondary and 25% tertiary [I], We have described the immobilization of PEI on porous silica beads [2] and silica gel [3]. A three-step process is used to produce materials which we have termed 'polymer ghosts' (Fig. I): first, PEI is adsorbed onto the in- organic particles; the adsorbed polymer layer is then chemically crosslinked; the composite is then leached to remove all or part of the inorganic material to provide a material with high surface area [4]. Palladium catalysts can be prepared as shown in Fig. 2. The Pd2'1\" binds strongly to the amine support, and metal loadings of up to 5% can be achieved. The reduction of the palla- dium may be accomplished with sodium borohydride in water or organic solvent; aqueous formaldehyde is also effective. Palladium/PEI/silica beads and palladium/PEI/silica powder have been prepared with porous silica beads (surface area 52 m2 g~1) and silica gel (500 m2 g~1) as the respective starting materials. Both catalysts are active with hydrogen or formic acid. In this paper, we describe their use in debenzylation reactions and in the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds. The catalysts are reusable, and readily settle out from suspension. Catalysts (1% Pd) have shown no pyrophoric behavior when used with organic solvents.

PEI-'ghosts' attracted us because of their high surface area and metal chelating capacity. In addition, because the amino groups of the catalyst support are readily modifiable with straightforward chemistry, we felt that the system provided an opportunity to alter the environment of the metal. Since large rate enhancements have been observed as a result of the hydro- phobic effect, one goal of this work was to prepare and evaluate hydro- phobic catalysts. In theory, the rate of reaction involving such catalysts could be changed according to the hydrophobic character of the solvent. Solvent compositions which were just hydrophobic enough to dissolve the reactant would be desirable in this case; the reactant would tend to leave the solvent and bind to the catalyst support in the vicinity of the metal. Also, negatively-charged reactants would be attracted to the catalyst and positively-charged products repelled, in analogy to some enzyme reactions. Experimental section Materials PEI was purchased from Cordova Chemical Company as Corcat (MW 60000, 33% PEI in water). Xama -2, a poly functional aziridine crosslinking agent, was also obtained from Cordova. Silica gel (Grade 923) was from Davison/W.R. Grace, and silica beads were supplied by Corning (Code Number 691952, 35-40 mesh, average pore diameter 275 A). PEI adsorption to silica beads The PEI binding capacity of silica beads was determined in the follow- ing manner. A sample of silica (0.1 g) was placed into a 12 ml screw-cap tube with methanol (about 7 ml). The tubes were placed in a heated desiccator and a vacuum was applied for removal of trapped air. The methanol was removed with a pipet fitted with nylon net. Five ml of the desired PEI solu- tion were then added, and the tube was tightly capped. The PEI/silica sus- pensions were rotated end-over-end for 3 h and the supernatant solution was removed.

The binding of PEI to silica beads. One g of silica beads was equilibrated with methanolic solutions of PEI. The beads were then washed twice with methanol, dried, and then ground to a fine powder. The PEI content was determined by use of ninhydrin reagent [5] . the beads were washed once with methanol prior to the determination of primary amine content. In this manner, loosely bound PEI would be re- moved. Methanol (5 ml) was added, and the mixture was agitated by vortex mixer for 5 s. The wash was removed, and the beads were dried in a heated desiccator and then ground to a fine powder for the determination of primary amine content by the ninny drin test [5]. Preparation ofPEI/silica beads PEI/silica beads were synthesized using a rotary evaporator (Buchi, REI 20). Fifty grams of silica beads were placed in a 1000 ml round-bottom flask, and 200 ml of PEI/methanol were added. Trapped air was removed by lowering the pressure while the flask was rotated at maximum speed at room temperature. Methanol was then evaporated (35 C). The resulting PEI beads were dried in a heated vacuum desiccator. Twenty g of PEI/silica beads (4 wt.%), were placed in a 250 ml round-bottom flask, and 50 ml of 0.5% glutaraldehyde m THF were added. The flask was placed on the rotary evaporator and rotated at 1/4 maximal speed for an additional 30 min. The THF solution was removed by suction with a gas dispersion tube and re- placed with 100 ml of aqueous NaBH4 (1%). The flask was rotated at 1/4 maximal speed for l h. The borohydride solution was decanted and 100 ml of aqueous formic acid (15%) was added. After rotation for l h at 1/4 maximal speed, the formic acid solution was decanted and 5 N NaOH (200 ml) was added. After leaching the preparation for l h at 1/4 maximum rotation speed, the beads were washed to neutrality with water and dried in a vacuum desiccator. All of the above operations were performed at room temperature. Adsorption of palladium The binding of palladium by the PEI composites can be followed spectrophotometrically (375 nm). A palladium acetate stock solution was prepared by dissolving PdCl^ (0.2 g) in 2 ml of concentrated HC1 with heat- ing. Addition of sodium acetate solution (48 ml, 15% w/v NaAc^HaO) yields the stock solution which contains 2.5 mg of palladium per ml. To determine the adsorption rate, l g of PEI/silica composite was shaken on a wrist-action shaker with 4 ml of palladium acetate stock solution in a 25 ml Erienmeyer flask. Samples were withdrawn at timed intervals for spectro- photometric analysis. The control experiment shown in Fig. 4 was per- formed with silica beads which were subjected to the procedure for prepar- ing PEI/silica beads from which the PEI was omitted. Sodium borohydride reduction in various solvents Water and several organic solvents were used in the reduction step of catalyst preparation. The concentrations of NaBH4 in the solvents were as follows: 0.05 g ml\"1 DMF, 0.025 g mF1 diglyme, 0.02 g ml\"\"1 ethanol and 0.25 g ml\"1 water. These solutions were made by cooling the solvents below 5 C m an ice-water bath and adding the specified amount of NaBH4. Several 1 g samples of support were placed in 25 ml Erienmeyer flasks. After the Pd^ was adsorbed from the PdCli-NaAc solution, the supernatant was removed by suction through a pipet fitted with polyester net. The Pd24\" PEI/silica beads were washed two times (10 ml each time) with the solvent chosen for the reduction, and then 1 ml of the solvent was added to the beads. The flask was cooled to below 5 C. The solutions of NaBKU in the chosen solvent were maintained at the same temperature. Reduction of the Pd2\"1\" was carried out by pipetting an appropriate volume (50 mg NaBH4 g\"' support) of the cold borohydride solution into the flask followed by a vigorous swirling motion. Reduction was allowed to continue for 15 min with agitation of the flask about every 5 min. Procedure for the reduction of Pd^/silica beads in water using NaBH^ After the Pd2\"1\" was adsorbed on the support, the liquid phase was removed from the solid beads (l g) by suction through a pipet fitted with polyester net. The beads were washed with water two times (15 ml each). One ml of water was then added and the suspension was cooled in an ice- water bath to between 0 and 2 C. A solution of NaBH4 in water was made by dissolving sodium borohydride in water (precooled to 0-4 C). For the reduction of l g of support, NaBH4 (150 mg) was dissolved in 3 ml of cold water. One ml of this solution was added to the Pd^/silica beads in water, and the beads were swirled rapidly for about l min. The beads were then allowed to sit in an ice-water bath for 0.5 h with intermittent swirling. At the end of this time, the supernatant was removed. The blackened beads were then washed twice with 10 -15 ml of water. One ml of water was added and the flask was cooled in an ice-water bath. Reduction was repeated by adding 1.0 ml of the borohydride solution followed by a vigorous swirling motion. The beads were allowed to sit in an ice-water bath for 30 min with intermittent agitation, washed four times with water (15 ml each time), and then washed two times with methanol (10 -15 ml each time) prior to drying in a vacuum desiccator. Reduction in this fashion requires 100 mg NaBH4 g\"1 of beads. Preparation of octanoyl/PEI/silica beads Three g of PEI/glutaraldehyde/silica beads were placed in a 100 ml round-bottom flask, and 25 ml of 20 vol.% triethylamine in DMF were added. A vacuum was applied for 30 min for the removal of trapped air. The triethylamine solution was removed by decantation and 0.28 g of octanoyl chloride in 10 ml of DMF were added. An additional 1 ml of 20% triethyl- amine in DMF was added. The suspension was rotated at 1/4 maximal speed on the rotary evaporator for 48 h at room temperature. The modified sup- port was washed with 20% TEA in DMF, DMF, methanol, water and methanol and dried in a heated vacuum desiccator. Synthesis of octyl/PEI/silica beads Two g of PEI silica beads were placed in a 100 ml round-bottom flask and triethylamine/HMPA (20%, 25 ml) was added. A vacuum was applied for the removal of trapped air as the flask was slowly rotated on the rotary evaporator. The supernatant solution was removed by suction with a gas dispersion tube, and the procedure was repeated. After removing the second wash, 10 ml of HMPA was added. To this suspension was added 1.23 g of octyl bromide and 1.29 g of triethylamine. The mixture was rotated at 1/4 maximal speed on the rotory evaporator for 72 h at 50 C. The HMPA solu- tion was removed by suction through a gas dispersion tube, and the modified beads were washed with additional 20% triethylamine/HMPA, HMPA, and methanol and dried in a heated vacuum desiccator. Preparation ofPEI/silica gel Silica gel (10 g) was mixed with the PEI stock solution (0.5 g PEI/10 ml MeOH). The methanol was removed with a rotary evaporator. The silica was then washed briefly with cold methanol to remove extraneous PEI and dried in a vacuum desiccator. Twenty-five ml of 1% (wt/v) glutaraldehyde in water was added to the silica gel and the suspension rotated at room temper- ature for 30 min. The glutaraldehyde solution was replaced with 25 ml of 1% PEI in methanol and rotated for an additional 30 min. The PEI solution was poured off, and NaBH4 (300 mg in 25 ml MeOH) was added. After rota- tion for 30 min, the preparation was washed with water, methanol and dried in a vacuum desiccator. Preparation of Pd/PEI/silica gel A palladium stock solution was made by mixing l ml of l N HCl with 85 mg PdCli and heating to dissolve the mixture. Ten ml of a 15% solution of NaAc- 3H20 was added. This palladium stock solution (4.4 ml) was added to 2 g of PEI/silica gel. Uptake of Pd2* was complete within 10 min. The preparation was then reduced with 300 mg of NaBH4 m 10 ml of cold MeOH. After washing with water, 10% formic acid/water and methanol, the catalyst was dried in a heated vacuum desiccator. Preparation of PEI/Xama /silica gel PEI (10 g, 33% aqueous) was mixed with 0.3 g of Xama -2 m 10 ml of MeOH and refluxed for 10 min. The volume was then adjusted to 50 ml with MeOH. Five ml of the PEI-Xama solution were mixed with 10 g of silica gel suspended in 100 ml of methanol. The mixture was stirred with an over- head stirrer and heated on a boiling water bath for 15 min. Methanol was then evaporated, and the PEI-silica was repeatedly suspended in water until the decanted wash water gave a negative ninhydrin test. The support was dried in a heated vacuum desiccator. Preparation o f hydrophobia PEI/Xama silica gel supports (1) Acy/atibn: PEI/Xama silica gel (5 g) was washed twice with 2% triethylamine m DMF (50 ml). Enough DMF was added to cover the sup- port. To this suspension was added p-nitrophenyl caproate (0.9 g) and triethylamine (0.13 ml). The reaction mixture was continuously rotated for 24 h at 5 C. At the end of this time, the silica gel was filtered, washed with methanol and dried in a vacuum desiccator. (2) Reductive alkylation: (a) Aqueous buff er-methanol mixture. PEI/ Xama /suica gel was mixed with hexanal (50 ssi) in a mixture of 0.1 M borate buffer (25 ml, pH 8.5) and methanol at 4 \"C. NaBH4 (70 mg total) was added in six equal portions over a period of l h with occasional agita- tion. The support was then washed with water and methanol, and then dried in a heated vacuum desiccator. The decrease in primary amine content was 14%. (b) In methanol. PEI/Xama /silica gel (2 g) was washed with 2% triethylamine in DMF (50 ml) and suspended in 10 ml of methanol. To this suspension was added hexanal (340 fil) in 2 ml of ethanol. The suspension was agitated occasionally. After 30 min, NaBH4 (25 mg) was added in five equal portions over a period of 1 h. The support was then washed with water and methanol, and dried in a vacuum desiccator. The decrease in primary amine content was 32.5%. (3) Alkylation: PEI/Xama silica gel was suspended in 10 ml of DMF containing 100 {d of triethylamine. To this suspension was added 100 fu of benzyl bromide, and the mixture was rotated for l h at 90 \"C. The material was washed with methanol and dried in a vacuum desiccator. The decrease in primary amine content was 28%. Preparation of hydrophobic/PEI/silica bead and silica gel/palladium catalysts Hydrophobic/PEI/silica catalysts were synthesized by the same general method as underivatized PEI/silica catalysts. The only change in the pro- cedure was the amount of time the hydrophobic derivatives were exposed to solutions of Pd2\"1\". The underivatized PEI/silica beads and silica gel de- colorized solutions of Pd2* within 5 -10 min, while the hydrophobic deriv- atives required 24 - 48 h. Since the hydrophobic PEI/silicas tend to float in aqueous solution, the suspension was rotated to ensure maximum exposure of the PEI/silica to the Pd2'1\" solution. After the supernatant solution of the Pd2'1\" became colorless, the preparation was reduced with sodium boro- hydride as previously described. Repeated use of palladium/PEI/silica catalysts in formic acid A sample of catalyst (0.2 g) was placed in a 25 ml Erlenmeyer flask and was assayed for activity using Cbz Gly 0 t-butyl as the substrate in HCOOH:EtOH:H20 (assay described below). After about 60 - 70 min, the assay mixture was removed with a pipet fitted with polyester net. The cata- lyst was washed 4 times with 15 ml of methanol and dried in a vacuum desiccator. The Gbz Gly O t-butyl assay was performed with this 0.2 g sample 10 times and the (1/2 was determined for each run. Cbz Gly 0-t-butyl assay A stock solution of Gbz Gly-O t-butyl in ethanol was made and stored at 4 C. A 1:5 HCOOH^O solution was prepared fresh daily. The assay mixture consisted of 3.5 ml of HCOOHLEtOH^O and 0.12 g of Cbz Gly-0-t-butyl (2 ml of the HCOOH^O solution and 1.5 ml of the sub- strate m EtOH solution). The assay mixtures were agitated on a wrist- action shaker at maximum speed. The shaking motion of the flask can be described as a 20 deflection from the horizontal with approximately 240 excursions per minute. The distance travelled perpendicular to the horizontal was 2.5 cm. A weighed sample of catalyst was placed in a 25 ml Erlenmeyer flask and secured on the wrist-action shaker. The assay mixture was delivered to the flask (t = 0}, the flask was stoppered with a perforated cork, and the speed of shaking was brought to the maximum. Samples (4 ss\\) were taken at timed intervals, and the extent of reaction was determined by ninny drin analysis. Hydrogenation of nitrobemene/re-use of the Pd/PEI/silica gel Nitrobenzene (10.3 ml, 0.1 mol), methanol (90 ml), and 2.1 g of 1% Pd/PEI/glutaraldehyde/suica gel were added to a 500 ml 3-neck round- bottom flask equipped with an overhead stirrer. Hydrogenation was per- formed at atmospheric pressure. The flow of hydrogen gas was fixed at a constant rate with a Gilmont flowmeter (0.5 l min\"1, calibrated by air). The reaction was begun at room temperature. With no external temperature control the reaction mixture warmed to a temperature of about 56 C. At timed intervals, aliquots (10 jul) were removed and diluted with 5 ml of methanol and 95 ml of water. The samples were analyzed spectrophoto- metrically (220 - 320 nm). The stability test (re-use of 1% Pd/PEI/silica gel) was performed by using the same sample of catalyst 10 times. At the end of the reaction, the catalyst was filtered, washed with methanol, dried and recycled. Results Pd/PEI/silica beads Preparation In order to arrive at optimal conditions for the PEI adsorption step, we studied the binding of PEI as a function of polymer concentration (Fig. 3). In this study, silica beads were equilibrated with methanolic solutions of PEI. Weakly-bound PEI was removed with a methanol wash prior to the determination of bound polymer. The saturation point is about 4 wt.% PEI/ silica. Crosslinking is best done in a solvent that does not dissolve PEI; THF works well for this purpose. Glutaraldehyde and Xama (a multi-functional aziridine) are effective crosslinking agents. Uptake of Pd2'1\" by PEI/silica beads is quite rapid (Fig. 4). PEI/silica (1 g) can adsorb 10 mg of palladium in less than 10 min. Adsorption of Pd^ onto control beads (no PEI content) is not significant. Thus, binding of Pd^ to the composite occurs exclusively through interaction with the amine ligand. O D O 10 15 20 26 Time (minutes) 30 5 15 30 46 60 75 Time (minutes) Fig. 4.

Double reduction with aqueous borohydride (5 g NaBH4/100 g of beads) produces an acceptable catalyst. 10 Hydrophobie substitution of the PEI/silica beads was done in order to augment interaction of apolar reactants with the catalyst support (Table 1). Reaction rates with the hydrophobic catalysts were not as fast as those for unsubstituted catalyst beads (Fig. 5). Properties Pd/PEI/silica beads made by the procedure reported here have a surface area of 47 - 52 m2 g\"1 (BET) (Table 2). The palladium content is 1.09% in good agreement with the theoretical value. The beads can be used in a packed bed reactor. Suspension of the beads by shaking is also effective. The beads settle quickly from suspension, which permits direct decantation of the, product solution. Use of a magnetic stirrer results in rapid destruction of the beads.

With hydrogen gas using Cbz Asp Phe OME, palladium-on-carbon is slightly more effective than the palladium beads (data not shown). Repeated use of the Pd/PEI/ silica bead catalyst using formic acid as the hydrogen donor results m some loss of activity (Fig. 7). The catalyst may be partially reactivated by treat- ment with NaBHH. Pd/PEI/silica gel. Preparation The PEI/silica gel is synthesized by adsorbing PEI to the extent of 6% onto silica gel and then washing with cold methanol. After drying the coated gel, crosslinking is accomplished by treatment with aqueous glutaraldehyde.

Re-use of the Pd/PG/silica bead catalyst in formic acid/deblocking of Cbz Gly 0 t-butyl. Using organic solvents in the crosslinking step tends to cause agglomeration of the gel particles. Uptake of Pd2* by the PEI/silica gel is rapid and comparable to the rate of uptake by PEI/silica beads. Adsorption is complete within 5-10 min; the extent of palladium uptake is greater than 95%. Reduction with borohydride can be accomplished with solvents such as methanol, ethanol and water. Hydrophobie derivatives of PEI/silica gel were made for two reasons for evaluation of the effects on the palladium catalyst activity and for Chro- matographie applications. The degree of hydrophobic substitution of the PEI/silica gel is shown in Table 3. Reaction rates with hydrophobic PEI/ silica gel catalysts were not as fast as those for the corresponding unsub- stituted Pd/PEI/silica gel catalysts (Fig. 8).

Comparison of the hydrophobic Pd/PEI/silica gel catalysts. The assay mixture consisted of EtOH (1.5 ml), formic acid (0.33 ml) and water (0.5 ml). The substrate used was Cbz Gly-0-t-Butyl. 1% Pd/PEI/glutaraldehyde/silica gel catalyst A; 1% pd/PEI/ silica gel catalyst o; 1% Pd/hexyl/PEI/silica gel catalyst A; l% Pd/benzyl/PEI/silica gel catalyst . Fig. 9. Demonstration of the stability of Pd/PEI/silica gel used in the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene in methanol at atmospheric pressure. Properties Pd/PEI/silica gel catalyst has a surface area of 500 m2 g\"1 (BET) (Table 2). The palladium content was 1.05%. In contrast to the Pd/PEI/silica beads, the Pd/PEl silica gel can be used in a Parr shaker and in reactors with over- head stirring. In both cases, the catalyst can be recovered easily by filtration. Use of a magnetic stirrer results in disintegration of the gel to a fine powder. The Pd/PEI/silica gel catalyst will efficiently reduce nitrobenzene to aniline. After ten uses the catalyst retained full activity (Fig. 9). When the Pd/PEI/silica gel catalyst was re-used with formic acid, however, a rapid decrease in activity was observed. A significant amount of activity was restored after treatment of the used catalyst with NaBH4. Discussion It was our goal to prepare an inorganic/organic composite with high surface area and metal binding capacity with the hope of preparing more effective and/or selective hydrogenation catalysts. The readily modifiable amino groups of PEI and the affinity of PEI for various metal ions attracted us to PEI/silica conjugates. Two types of silica were selected porous silica beads and silica gel. Klotz and co-workers [6] have prepared a number of PEI-based catalysts which show enzyme-like characteristics. Hydrophobic 13 derivatives of PEI containing alkylaminopyridine substituents are very effective catalysts of nitrophenylester hydrolysis. The hydrophobic cavity of cyclodextrins has been exploited by Breslow [7] in dramatic demonstra- tions of the enzyme-like behavior of cyclodextrin catalysts. In this study the introduction of apolar groups into the support sur- prisingly resulted in no rate enhancements in the hydrogenolysis of the Cbz-group of a neutral peptide reactant, Cbz Gly 0 t-butyl. In theory, the matrix should have a strong affinity for the reactant and the positively- charged product should be repelled by the catalyst which is also positively charged. The apolar groups were introduced prior to the attachment of metal. One explanation is that the most accessible chelation sites were blocked by the attachment of the hydrophobic substitutents. An alternate explana- tion is that the binding of reactant was too strong, which would be com- parable to substrate/product inhibition in enzyme catalysis. Reactant tight- ly bound m the wrong orientation would be unreactive and also might limit access to other metal sites m the catalyst matrix. The catalysts which contain no hydrophobic substitutents have a num- ber of features which suggest their use in lab-scale synthetic applications. Unlike palladium-on-carbon, the Pd/PEl silica catalysts have shown no pyrophoric behavior. Use of a filter aid is not necessary for either Pd/PEl silica beads or Pd/PEl silica gel. The catalysts can be separated from the product simply by decanting the supernatant solution. The re-usability and stability of the catalysts are also attractive features. Finally, the possibility to perform hydrogenation reactions with formic acid or formate salts in polar solvents may be important in instances where the insolubility of reactants or products is a problem.

Box 400, Naperville, IL 60566, U.S.A. We report the preparation and evaluation of palladium catalysts made from polyethylenimine (PEI)/silica composites. PEI was adsorbed to either porous silica beads or silica gel. Following crosslinking, the material was leached with base to increase the surface area and availability of the polymer. The PEI/silicas rapidly chelate Pd2+ from solution. Reduction of the chelated metal ions can be accomplished with sodium borohydride. Pd/PEI/silica beads are used effectively in suspension with formic acid as the hydrogen donor; deprotection of Cbz-Glycine-O-t-butyl (where Cbz=carbobenzoxy) is very rapid with this catalyst compared to palladium on carbon. The Pd/ PEI/silica gel catalyst can be used effectively with hydrogen gas for the reduction of nitrobenzene in methanol. Both catalysts are conveniently separated from product by simply decanting the supernatant solution. The catalysts (1% Pd) have shown no pyrophoric behavior and they are reusable. Hydrophobic derivatives of the catalysts were prepared with the hope that apolar reactants would be attracted to the metal sites with a concomitant enhancement of rate. The introduction of apolar groups into the catalyst matrix did not, however, result in a more effective catalyst compared to the catalyst made from the unmodified material. References 1 L.E.
