The alumina was shown to behave as a textural promoter. The model of the reduced Ni-AI catalyst consisted of highly dispersed nickel and alumina particles with a Ni-A1 spinel phase at their interface. The Ni-A1 spinel phase had mainly an inverse structure. In the reduced sample the para- crystallinity of nickel was evidenced by precise diffraction measurements using synchrotron radiation. The spinel structure was not observed when copper was introduced. As a result, the alumina particles were more dispersed and covered the surface of the Ni-Cu particles enriched with copper.

Introduction Supported nickel catalysts are commonly used for the decomposition of hydro- carbons. In some cases this process led to the formation of filamentous carbon [ 1 ]. According to a generally accepted model [2] it includes an activation of the molecules on the Ni (100) and/or Ni (110) facets and formation of surface carbon, followed by carbon diffusion across the nickel particles and deposition of the filamentous carbon on the Ni( 111 ) planes. Therefore, one can see that modification * Corresponding author. E-mail: kochubey @catalysis.nsk.su, fax. ( + 7-383) 2355756. 0926-860X/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

Shaikhutdinov et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 125-139 of the catalysts by e.g. some additives can influence the above mechanism. Indeed, it is shown that sulphur as well as copper in large concentrations in supported 20 wt.-% Ni/SiO2 steam reforming catalysts give rise to the formation of 'octopus' carbon, in which many amorphous filaments have grown from one metal particle [3]. Earlier we have demonstrated [4,5] that the decomposition of methane was performed efficiently with coprecipitated Ni-A1 catalysts with high nickel content. Under the reaction conditions employed (823 K, PcH4 = 100 kPa) large amounts of the filamentous carbon were formed. In addition, the carbon capacity, i.e. the carbon and catalyst (or nickel) weight ratio measured after complete deactivation of the catalyst, depended on the Ni:A1 ratio with a maximum at Ni:AI-~ 17 (or 90 wt.-% Ni-alumina). The effect of the additives on the genesis of these catalysts during the decomposition of methane at the above conditions has not been inves- tigated yet. As yet it is still unclear, if any essential differences between catalysts with high and low Ni:A1 ratio as well as between coprecipitated and impregnated Ni/A1203 catalysts exists. For high Ni:A1 ratios the term 'support' is not as self- evident as for low ratios and for supported Ni/AI203 catalysts. Moreover, it is shown that the formation of active domains and their growth occurs during the reaction for supported 20 wt.-% Ni/SiO2 catalyst [3] and, more definitely, in coprecipitated Ni-AI catalysts with high nickel content [5]. Therefore, the Ni:A1 ratio could be crucial for the catalyst's structure due to e.g. sintering. In this first paper we have investigated the structure of coprecipitated Ni-A1 and Ni-Cu-A1 catalysts in the calcined and reduced states by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). 2. Experimental The catalysts were prepared by coprecipitation as described elsewhere [6]. Precipitation was carried out from aqueous solutions of Ni(NO3)2\"6H20 and Al(NO3)3\" 9H20 in known proportions and using NaOH as precipitate. The sam- ples were carefully washed with distilled water until no NO3 ions were detected in the remaining solution. Calcination was carried out in a flow of nitrogen for 3 h at a final temperature of 350 which was achieved by heating at a rate of ca. 5 rain- ~. Samples were reduced in a flow of pure hydrogen at 550 for 3 h with the same temperature rate. (Samples are indicated using abbreviations as in Table I. For conciseness the Ni-Cu-A1 samples with 10 wt.-% of alumina are indicated in the text as 90 (Ni-Cu) samples.) On exposure to air, the reduced catalysts show a pyrophoric behaviour. Before the studies the reduced samples were passivated in ethanol at room temperature before unloading them from the reactor. This procedure did not influence the catalytic properties of the catalysts after reloading. S.K. Shaikhutdinov et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 125-139 127 X-ray powder diffraction measurements were carried out on a Siemens URD-63 diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation and a graphite crystal monochromator. The lattice parameters were measured from XRD spectra using silicon as internal stan- dard. The crystallite size was calculated from the line width to fit the Scherrer equation. EXAFS spectra of the K-edges of the nickel and copper were obtained at the EXAFS Station of the Siberian Center of Synchrotron Radiation, Novosibirsk. X- ray absorption spectra were recorded in the standard transmission mode. Ionization chambers filled with argon under a pressure of 5 and 100 kPa was used as detectors. The spectra were treated using common procedures [7] such as cubic-spline back- ground subtraction of the oscillation part of the absorption coefficient (X). Fourier transformation of kx(k) with wave number (k) range of 2-11 A ~ and a Gauss window halfwidth 0.5 ,~-i was used to obtain the radial atom distribution (RDA) curve. Nickel foil and NiO powder were used as reference samples to calibrate the phase corrections, 6, for Ni-Ni and Ni-O distances for a given interval of k values and coordination number, N. For paracrystallinity measurements the precise diffraction pattern with lines of high Miller index were recorded on a diffractometer [ 8 ] using synchrotron radiation in the above Center. The paracrystallinity was determined as described elsewhere [9] by using the relationship between the variance ghkl=((~k~)-- (dhkl) 2) ~/(dhk~) and p2 = h2 + k2 -k- 12, where (...) means averaging of the appro- priate interplanar distance. For the analysis the (111), (222), (333) as well as (200) and (400) lines were used. Auger measurements were done with an ESO-03 (Russia) coaxial-gun CMA analyzer operating at 3 keV primary energy. The beam intensity and diameter were ca. 100/zA cm-2 and 20/xm, respectively. All spectra were recorded at the same instrumental set-up to compare the Auger intensities of the samples. 3. Results 3.1. X-ray powder diffraction The XRD data are summarized in Table 1. The diffraction patterns of the calcined Ni-A1 samples were characterized by lines from the Ni-A1 spinel phase besides NiO lines. Since the most intensive spinel line from the NiAI204(311) plane overlaps with the NiO( 111 ) ones, the spinel phase has been observed more clearly in samples with a high AI:Ni ratio which are characterized by less NiO phase. For lower AI:Ni ratios the broad asymmetric line in the 20= 36-38region was decon- voluted into its two component lines, i.e. spinel (311 ) and oxide ( 111 ), by using a computer simulation program [ 10]. The data show that the calcined sample 90Ni consists of a spinel phase with D3L1 ---- 3 nm and NiO with DI~ = 8.6 nm. It is found 128 S.K.

The diffraction parameters of the spinel in the reduced samples is nearly the same as for the calcined ones. It appears that the spinel phase is less perturbed by the reduction. We also found that in the 90Ni sample the paracrystallinity does exist with parameters gIrl=0.008 and g~oo=0.012, which are close to g~j=0.012 and g~oo = 0.015, observed by Wright et al. [9] using neutron diffraction in a similarly prepared 75 wt.-% Ni-alumina sample. In contrast to the Ni-A1 system the spinel phase was not observed in the diffrac- tion pattern of 90 (Ni-Cu) samples. When the Cu:Ni ratio increases the lattice parameter in the reduced samples also increases monotonously (see Table 1 ) and, therefore, Ni-Cu alloying occurs during reduction. In samples with a high Cu:Ni ratio the presence of small amounts of copper particles was also detected. 3.2. EXAFS study The position of the RDA peaks and the structural parameters of the nickel coordination are given in Table 2. Nickel K-edge EXAFS spectra of all the Ni-AI and Ni-Cu-A1 calcined samples were identical to NiO, except for the RDA curve of the 57Ni sample, which had a shoulder in the Ni-O region. With the latter sample the amplitude of the peak assigned to Ni-O in the RDA curve increased considerably and, therefore, indicated a higher ordering of the first coordination sphere of nickel in the 57Ni sample. This seems to be connected to the fact that nickel atoms are located in octahedral sites in both NiO and Ni-A1 spinel phases. In contrast, the Ni-Ni peak intensity decreased. This could mean that S.K. Shaikhutdinov et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (l 995) 125-139 129 Table 2 EXAFS spectroscopy data of calcined and reduced samples Sample Atom pair R- ~ (~.)

EXAFS data of the reduced Ni-A1 samples showed that nickel atoms exist in two phases and their distribution depends on the Ni:A1 ratio. Indeed, the RDA curve for 90Ni sample was identical to that of nickel foil and unpromoted 100Ni, whereas when the Ni:AI ratio decreased, the amplitude of the Ni-O peak in RDA curve increased monotonously (Fig. la). As stated above, the intensity of Ni-O line is nearly equal to that of Ni-Ni in the NiO phase and approximately two fold higher in the spinel phase (Table 2). Fig 1 a shows that there are no peaks attributed to the Ni-Ni (2.51 ,~) distance which intensity is comparable to that of Ni-O. Therefore, we believe that this Ni-O peak is to be attributed to the spinel phase. It is well known [7] that Ni-O distance strongly depends on their coordination sphere. The fact that the Ni-O peak in the reduced samples coincides with that of in pure NiO means that nickel atoms are located in octahedral sites. Nevertheless, the short distance shoulder in the RDA curve which is more evident for 57Ni sample indicates that a part of the nickel atoms is located in tetrahedral sites as well. Thus, EXAFS data shows that the spinel in the reduced and likely in the calcined Ni-A1 samples has mainly inverse structure. Nickel K-edge absorption spectra of the reduced 90 (Ni-Cu) samples are iden- tical to those of 90Ni without copper additives (Fig. lb). Copper K-edge spectra is similar to copper and/or nickel foil so that it is impossible to discriminate them by EXAFS due to their near equal lattice parameters and isomorphic copper sub- 130 S.K.

Nevertheless, the amplitude of the peak assigned to the metal-metal distance in the copper coordination sphere was found to decrease with increasing Cu:Ni ratio. This could be attributed to an increasing Debye-Waller factor since the coordination number of the metals in Ni-Cu alloys is the same. Therefore, with increasing Cu:Ni ratio the alloy becomes rather inhomogeneous and some splitting of a copper containing phase is likely to occur. 3.3. Surface characterization Overlapping of Auger transitions in low energy regions made it impossible to obtain information about the upper surface layers. So, in this case Ni (848 eV), Cu (920 eV) and A1 (1396 eV) Auger lines were used for surface characterization. The contribution from copper to the overlapping nickel peak at 848 eV was esti- mated using known ratios of the copper peaks [ 11 ]. The most intense line in the AES spectra was the O 512 eV line (Fig. 2), which could be attributed both to alumina and to passivated nickel film in the reduced samples and to NiO in the calcined ones, respectively. Since the Auger Ni:O ratio in the reduced unpromoted 100Ni sample was larger than in the calcined one, it was suggested that in the reduced samples the nickel particles were covered by a thin oxide film. Its thickness was estimated to be smaller than the Auger escape depth in the oxide by using the NiO/Ni layer model (see Appendix). This conclusion is in agreement with the fact that the oxide layer of nickel exposed to oxygen or air does not extend to more than 2-3 monolayers [ 12 ]. Moreover, calculation shows that the Auger Ni signal from the non-passivated clean surface will be slightly larger by factor of ca. 1.1 in comparison with the passivated one. The experiment with Ar+-sputtering has demonstrated that the calculated and experimental values of this factor were nearly equal. S.K.

Therefore, we believe that the passivation does not misrepresent the general tendencies in the surface composition based on AES data. The passivation seems to decrease the Auger intensity from the metal surface only and does not influence the alumina-rich phase. In any case, we used Auger nickel, copper and aluminium intensity ratios as representative for the surface composition of the catalysts. Small amounts of inhomogeneously distributed C1 and C contaminations were also detected both in calcined and reduced samples. They appeared to be adsorbed on the surface since their Auger signals were decreasing due to the electron stim- ulated desorption under the primary electron beam. These contaminations did not affect the Auger ratios used and, therefore, the conclusions reached. 3.4.

After the reduction the alu- minium peak increases significantly, especially at low AhNi bulk ratio, so that the relationship of the (IAl/INi)red versus bulk ratio becomes nonlinear. 3.5. Ni-Cu-Al catalysts Using Auger sensitivity of the nickel and copper lines [ 11 ] the surface copper ratios were calculated for the 90 (Ni-Cu) samples (Fig. 4). The approximately linear dependence for the calcined samples is likely to indicate that both metals are uniformly distributed in the oxide phase. In the reduced samples a surface enrich- ment of copper is observed. Note that data for ca. 30 at.-% Cu are overestimated due to the presence of some amount of copper crystallites (Table 1 ). Such a surface segregation of copper at room temperature is well known for massive foils and has also been found in Ni-Cu/SiO2 catalysts [13]. In addition, this fact confirms indirectly that passivation does not considerably change the surface structure. The reduction of the 90 (Ni-Cu) samples significantly increases the aluminium peak and considerably decreases the nickel peaks. Moreover, their ratio IA~/IN~ depends strongly on the copper bulk ratio with a maximum at ca. 3 at.-% Cu (Fig. 5). In contrast, this effect is not observed for the calcined samples. 4. Discussion 4.1. Ni-AI catalysts\" The structural properties of the coprecipitated Ni-alumina system have been studied in considerable detail during the last few years [9,14-19]. Their structure is found to depend on the Ni:A1 ratio, the calcination and reduction temperatures. For samples with low nickel content the spinel phase NiAI204 was usually observed [ 16]. In reduced samples with Ni:A1 > 3 only pure nickel crystallites have been S.K.

Data for the 57Ni-23Cu sample are shown by filled symbols. detected [ 14] and NiO only in calcined samples at nearly the same preparation temperatures as used in this paper (see Section 2). Besides, Wright et al. [9] have also shown the paracrystalline state of the nickel in 75 wt.-% Ni/alumina. They suggested that this state was connected with the alumina, probably in the form of (AIO2) groups, within the nickel particles. Our XRD data demonstrate that the spinel phase is formed in all of the calcined and reduced Ni-A1 samples under study with Ni:A1 > 3 up to Ni:A1 ~ 17. In addition, precise XRD measurements using synchrotron radiation show the paracrystallinity of nickel in the reduced 90Ni sample. EXAFS data also confirm the presence of the spinel phase in the reduced samples, especially in those with a low Ni:A1 ratio. Moreover, the analysis of the RDA curves shows that this spinel is mainly inverse, i.e. nickel atoms are mostly located in octahedral sites, but some of them are also in tetrahedral ones. The fact that no lines from the NiO phase are observed in the XRD pattern indicates that the Ni-O peak in the RDA curves is not connected with incomplete reduction of the NiO phase. The nonlinear relationship of the Auger AI:Ni ratio versus bulk (Fig. 3) in reduced samples could indicate, in principle, a heterogeneous phase surface struc- ture or some segregation with alloying, if any. The formation of the Ni-A1 alloy is not confirmed by X-ray methods. Since the Ni-A1 spinel phase is unchanged during the reduction, one can conclude that the significant increasing of the aluminium surface concentration in samples with a low AI:Ni ratio could be attributed to surface segregation of the alumina as a result of the reduction of the nickel-rich phase NiO.xA1203 suggested in ref. [ 18] and also observed in our samples by analysis based on differential solubility [20]. For the interpretation of the nonlinear relationship in Fig. 2 let us consider for a first approximation that in the reduced samples the contribution of the Auger signals from the Ni-AI spinel phase to the Auger AI:Ni ratio is negligible because of their invariability. Suppose also, that the nickel particles of diameter DN~ are partially 134 S.K.

Taking into account that DNi is larger than the Auger escape depth of nickel, the roughness of the sample will not considerably affect the results if we assume the following expression to be valid for an infinite plane model: IAl/INi-= (~1/~i) ( O,d), F( O,d) =O[1-exp(-d/AAO]/[1-O+Oexp(-d/ANi)] (1) where FA~ and ~i are the Auger aluminium and nickel intensities in pure A1203 and passivated unpromoted 100Ni samples, respectively, measured at the same instru- mental conditions. 0 is the fraction of the nickel surface covered by alumina (coverage value) and Ai is the Auger decay length multiplied by the cosine of the CMA acceptance angle for appropriate energy in alumina. We used a decay length of 1.8 nm for alumina (see e.g. ref. [21] ) and 1.4 (from the universal curve) for nickel 848 eV electrons passing alumina. Two opposite cases can be considered if d<< Ai, then F(O,d) = Od/AA1 << 1 (2) if d >> Ai, then F(O,d) = O~ ( 1 - O) (3) From the mass balance: XpNiVNi = ( 1 - X) PAI2osVAI203 given that all the alumina which is present in the samples covers the spherical nickel particles (note also, that d << DNi), one can easily calculate: 0= (PNi/PAl203) X (DNi/6d) XX/(1 -X) (4) where X is the alumina-to-nickel weight ratio, Pi is the bulk density, Vi is the total volume of each component. Using ( 1 )-(4) we can conclude that the Auger AI:Ni ratio depends on the diameter of the nickel particle. Therefore, the nonlinear rela- tionship for the reduced samples could be attributed to the decrease of the nickel particle size while the AI:Ni ratio increases (Table 1 ). Indeed, we plotted a curve of (IAl//Ni)mod= (/AI//Ni)/DNi versus X/( 1 -X) as shown in Fig. 3 and found a linear relationship as predicted from the above calculations. It is experimentally found that the ratio FA1/FN~ is equal to 0.38 and, following that, the values of F(O,d) are calculated to be 0.8-1.2 for the samples under study. This indicates, from Eqs. (2) and (3), that DNi ~> d > AA~ and 0 is ca. 0.5. Taking into account that some aluminium atoms are included in the spinel phase it follows from Eq. (4) that product 0. d is less than 0.6 for 90Ni, and, hence, the value d < 1.2 rim, which is calculated, contradicts with d>> A as could be concluded from F(O,d) values. In other words, the alumina content is not sufficient to cover the nickel particle surface by a thick layer. From the fact that d is rather larger AA~ a model could be proposed which is based on the assumption that alumina particles are randomly distributed among the nickel S.K. Shaikhutdinov et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 125-139 135 particles. Taking into account that DNi is larger than the Auger escape depth of nickel of ca. 1.2 nm [ 22 ], the Auger AI:Ni ratio can be expressed, similarly to ( 1 ), as: IA1/INi = (FAI/IUNi) X (SA1203/SNi))~ [ 1 -exp( -- d/AA1) ] (5) where Si is the surface of the i-phase. Given by the alumina particles are sphere shaped, we obtain: IAfflyi = (~Al/~i) X IX~( 1 -X)] X (/:Ni/PA,2O3) (Dyi/d) (1 -exp( - d/AAI) (6) Thus, this model also explains the nonlinear relationship shown in Fig. 3 by the nickel size correction. After experimental data and values for pyi = 8.9 g cm 3 and PAI203-= 3.8 g cm-3 (for y-AI203) were substituted we obtained for d a value of ca. 4.5 and 7 nm in 90Ni and 57Ni, respectively. From the mass balance one can easily calculate the ratio of particle numbers rtAl203/rtNi to be ca. 8 for 90Ni, and 1.5 and 0.7 for 75Ni and 57Ni, respectively. Since alumina is likely to have a needle shaped morphology [ 15 ] the right hand part of expression (6) must be multiplied by 2/3 and d means the shortest dimension size. Recalculation gives d values of ca. 3 nm and 5 nm, respectively, but the ratio of numbers of particles will be nearly the same if we assume the aspect ratio for alumina to be ca. 3. The presence of a spinel phase could be taken into account in the above consid- eration by introducing items of the c~/3~ type into the numerator and denominator in the expressions ( 1 ) and (5), where c~ is the spinel-to-alumina surface ratio and 13i is similar to the Auger sensitivity of the nickel and aluminium in the spinel phase. Nevertheless, the linear relationship of (IA~/INi)mod shown in Fig. 3 seems to indicate that the effect of the spinel phase on the Auger ratio is small as suggested above. It should be noted that both XRD and microdiffraction in electron microscopy did not show any crystallites of the alumina phase in any of the samples under study. Nevertheless, the presence of an alumina phase in these reduced samples was previously found [20], especially in those with a high AI:Ni ratio. 4.2. Ni-Cu-Al catalysts XRD data show that the introduction of copper is likely to prevent the formation of a Ni-A1 spinel phase in 90 (Ni-Cu) samples. In addition, AES spectra show an almost two fold increase of the aluminium signal in the reduced 3 and 9 at.-% Cu samples in comparison to the 90Ni sample (Fig. 5). Thus, these data demonstrate that the effect of the copper is not to form a Ni-Cu alloy only but also to influence the alumina-containing phase. AES data show that Ni, Cu and A1 are probably homogeneously distributed in the calcined samples (Figs. 4, 5). As reduction proceeds, the alumina appears to 136 S.K. Shaikhutdinov et al. / Applied Catalv.ff,~ A: General 120 (1995) 125 139 segregate on the surface similar to the 90Ni sample. The relationships between Auger AI:(Ni+Cu) or AI:Ni and Cu or Cu~urf ratios are similar and show the existence of a maximum for the surface alumina at low copper bulk concentration. Thus, the copper surface segregation and, hence, the partial screening of nickel could not explain this effect, at least in low copper bulk content. It is found that the data for the sample with 20 wt.-% A1203 also fit a smooth curve after extrapolation to 10 wt.-% by using the factor X~ ( 1 - X) in expressions (4) and (6). Moreover, this maximum becomes more pronounced for the (IA~/IN~)mod curve shown in Fig. 5. Using the model of the randomly dispersed Ni-Cu and alumina particles and the size of the Ni-Cu particles from Table 1, one can estimate that the alumina particle size d of ca. 1.7 nm could fit the experimental values. This value is close to the Auger escape depth for alumina AA~ of ca. 1.5 nm [21 ], so the particle shape is not essential. In any case, these calculations show that the decrease of the alumina size and, in turn, the increase of their surface could occur when copper is introduced. Then the J/Al2OJrtNi ratio is estimated to be ca. 50, i.e. much more than in the 90Ni sample. A comparison of data obtained for the Ni-A1 and Ni-Cu-AI catalysts shows that an increase of the surface alumina in the latter samples could be connected with the absence of the spinel phase. It is well known that Cu2+ ions are stabilized by a square plane coordination which differs from the octahedral one for Ni2 +. So, the layer structure of the precipitate found after coprecipitation for the Ni-AI system [6,18] can be partially fragmented or distorted by copper ions. Therefore, the introduction of copper could prevent the formation of spinel or its growth in samples when calcined. Accordingly, the possible model of the reduced Ni-A1 catalyst studied in this paper could consist of highly dispersed nickel and alumina particles with a Ni-Al spinel phase possibly located at their interface. In addition, in this case spinel could be screened and not accessible for AES or, at least, its contribution could be small as suggested in the above model explaining the AES data. Based on our data and compiling models suggested by Alzomora et al. [18] and Wright et al. [9] it is reasonable to assume that there are two phases in the calcined samples: the nickel- rich with 'dissolved' (A1OD groups within NiO and an alumina-rich phase of nonstoichiometric Ni-AI spinel structure between the NiO particles or that expand to some extent through the NiO phase. Oriented growth of NiO crystallites on y- alumina and, hence, Ni-A1 spinel due to their similarity of crystal structure was evidenced by electron microdiffraction study of supported Ni/y-A1203 catalysts [ 23 ]. In the case of the Ni-Cu-A1 system the calcined sample could represent only the Ni-Cu-rich phase with (A102) inclusions. We believe that during reduction alumina formation occurs in two ways: first, the aluminium ions diffuse to the surface and the alumina phase grows [ 17], and second, through decomposition of nonstoichiometric Ni-A1 spinel with small nickel content by nickel ion diffusion. Nevertheless, a number of aluminium ions is still present in the nickel particles and S.K. Shaikhutdinov et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 125 139 137 leads to a paracrystalline state of nickel, observed by precise diffraction measure- ments of the 90Ni sample. During reduction of Ni-A1 samples the second mecha- nism seems to be predominant and relatively large alumina particles are formed. In the case of Ni-Cu-A1 samples the spinel phase is absent or highly dispersed and, therefore, an increase of the 'dissolved' aluminium ions which diffuse to the surface give rise to small alumina clusters on the surface of Ni-Cu alloy particles. Thus, the introduction of copper in coprecipitation leads to the formation of catalysts of different structure which are believed to show up in the formation of the active domain structure in methane decomposition and carbon deposition. 5. Conclusions The structure of coprecipitated Ni-A1 and Ni-Cu-A1 catalysts with high nickel content has been investigated by X-ray diffraction, EXAFS and AES spectroscopy in calcined and reduced samples. The alumina is shown to behave as textural promoter. The model of the reduced Ni-A1 catalyst consists of highly dispersed nickel and alumina particles with Ni-A1 spinel phase at their interface. In the reduced sample the paracrystallinity of nickel is evidenced by precise diffraction measurements using synchrotron radiation. When copper is introduced, the spinel structure is not observed. As a result, the alumina is more dispersed and covers the surface of Ni-Cu particles enriched with copper. Acknowledgements Authors thanks Mr. A.N. Shmakov for the measurements on the diffractometer using synchrotron radiation. Appendix 1 Using a NiO/Ni layer model for the 100Ni sample the Auger Ni:O ratio can be expressed as: ( INi/ lO)reO : O'NiNNi,NiO/~Ni,NiO[ 1 - exp( - A/ANi.~io) ] + OrNiNNi,NiANi,Niexp( -- A//~Ni,NiO) O-oNo.NioAo.Nio [ 1 -- exp( -- A/Ao,Nio) ] (al) where ~i is the Auger cross section; Na,j is the bulk atomic concentration of i = O,Ni atoms in the phases j = Ni,NiO, respectively; A is the oxide film thickness. 138 S.K. Shaikhutdinov et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 125-139 For A --. ~ one can obtain the following expression for the calcined sample: (INi/I0) cal -- O'NiNNi.NiOANi,NiO ( a2 ) O'oNo,NiO/~O,NiO Using (al) and (a2) as well as the fact that NNi,Ni/NNi,NiO = 2RNiMNio/PNioMNi, where Pi is the density and Mi is the molecular weight, and given that (IN~/ /O)rea= 1.0 0.1, (/Ni//O)c~1=0.6+0.05, is obtained from measurements, and ANi,NiO = 4 nm,/~-Ni,Ni = 1.5 nm, AO,NiO = 3 nm ( see e.g. ref. [ 22 ] ), one can calculate by iteration the value d to be ca. 2.5 nm. Since A is used in the above expressions as the J/A ratio, therefore, even some variations in the A values used for the calculations does not change the conclusion that the film thickness is smaller than Auger decay length. In addition, we used the Ar+-sputtering procedure to remove passivated film. After cleaning the 100Ni sample until no oxygen was detected in the spectra, the Auger nickel signal was increased by a factor of ca. 1.2 with respect to that of the passivated sample and nearly equal to a value of ca. 1.1 calculated using a similar procedure as above. When argon bombardment was applied to the reduced Ni-A1 catalysts the spectra were not changed significantly and the O peak still remained due to the presence of the alumina-rich phase as well as the porosity of the Ni-AI samples. Thus, we believe that the passivation does not misrepresent the general tendencies in surface composition based on AES data. References [ 1 ] J.C.
